THE TARTAN
Senate campaign trail 
reaches Wherrett Room
By LESLIE ZUBATY
Tartan Staffwriter
Democratic candidate for the United 
States Senate Lynn Yeakel, along with 
a strong campaigning committee, led 
an energetic rally in the Wherrett Room 
Saturday from 2 to 3:30 pm. With 77 
hours left until the polls close on pri
mary day, tomorrow, Tuesday, April 
28, Yeakels campaign was gearing up 
for the final crucial hours of gathering 
support.
Emcee Sue DeWalt opened the rally 
with an update of Yeakels campaign 
progress, introductions of Yeakels area 
campaign volunteers, and much en
thusiasm and anticipation for the up
coming primaries. DeWalt offered spe
cial thanks to rally co-chair Debbie 
Reed. Reed and DeWalt began orga
nizing the rally only one week ago and 
Reed professed that the job had been 
easy, as they have been riding the 
wave of momentum in the campaign.
Reed also expressed appreciation to 
Student Senator Michael Tomblyn 
(MCS), who organized the facilities for 
the rally.
Yeakel arrived at the Wherrett Room 
at 2:30 pm, receiving a warm and en
thusiastic reception from the crowd of 
approximately 150 people. Yeakel ap
peared very pleased with the turnout
ofthe event. She thanked the crowd for ,ana rIlulo oulll
all the excitement and support, saying, Lynn Yeakel speaks in the Wherrett Room Saturday.

Harkin says that, given the 
money for research and de
velopment, cheap, solar-hydrogen energy could be avail
able within 25 years.
Harkin concluded his ad
dress with a reaffirmation of 
his stand behind Clinton, 
though remembering his un
successful campaign. I 
may be out of the battle for 
the Presidency, but Im in the 
fight to get George Bush and 
Dan Quayle out ofthe White 
House, he said.
After speaking, Harkin 
answered some questions 
from a small group of attend
ees, including freshman 
drama student Jared Stein, a 
Brown supporter. Harkin 
fielded questions from Stein 
and other Brown supporters 
on differences between the 
environmental views of 
Brown and Clinton.
Before he left, Harkin an
swered a question about 
whether he would be inter
ested in the post of Secretary 
of the Interior by expressing 
some interest, while at the 
same time denying that he 
had been offered the VicePresidential slot by Clinton.

Yesterday, the CMU Earth 
Day events kicked into high 
gear with The 1992 Pittsburgh 
Earth Day Celebration.
On hand with information
laden tables were a host of en
vironmental activist groups, 
including CMU Earth Wise, 
CMUVegetarians, Pittsburgh 
Against Toxic Incineration 
and the Environmental Re
source Alliance of Pittsburgh. 
Also present were some local 
musical acts, including CMU 
studentMike Messer, and the 
bands Loch Gil, Fallopian 
Windsurfers, and The Bill 
Deasy Band, as well as sev
eral supporters of Democratic 
presidential hopeful Edmund 
G. Jerry Brown, wearing 
sandwich boards which dis
played information compar
ing Brown to opponent Bill 
Clinton.
A number of guest speakers 
were also present, including 
State Representative Thomas 
Murphy and U.S. Senator 
and former residential hope
ful Tom Harkin (D-Iowa). Also 
on the bill were Democratic 
presidential candidates 
Brown and Clinton.
Neither Brown nor Clinton 
were present, but Harkin func
tioned as a surrogate for Clinton.
Harkin was the keynote 
speaker, beginning shortly be
fore 6 pm. Introduced as One of 
the few politicians who can brag 
about his environmental record, 
by Student Senator Michael 
Tomblyn (MCS), Harkin spoke 
at great length on his environ
mental record, and on the ef
forts being made by Clinton and 
him to inject a strong environ
mental plank into Clintons plat
form, while calling for an end to 
what he termed President 
George Bushs mis-administration.
Bush, he said, is the kind of 
environmentalistwho would cut 
down a redwood and then stand 
on the stump to give a speech on 
the environment.
Harkin expressed his pleasure 
at the continuation of the Earth 
Day tradition, remembering the 
inaugural event in 1970.
The Senator also stressed his 
partys commitment to the re
searching of alternative energy 
sources, such as his pet project, 
solar-hydrogen energy, which 
would use energy harvested from 
sunlight to remove hydrogen 
from water, and then use the 
hydrogen as a fuel source for

Yesterday Student Senate revoked 
the Aikido at CMU Clubs funding in 
the culmination of an investigation 
that started March 4. A committee 
whose actions were secret until last 
week presentedits findings to Senates 
Funding and Recognition Committee 
(F&R), which in turn made recom
mendations to Senate. These included 
requiring that the club repay the $780 
Senate subsidy for fiscal year 1991-. 
92 and that it give up its promised 
subsidy for the 1992-93 fiscal year.
At 1 pm yesterday, after some diffi
culty in reaching quorum, Senate 
passed the resolution presented by 
F&R 13-0-1 in an emergency meet
ing called by Student Body President 
Natalie Gesmond. I was in disbelief 
that it was over that quickly, said
Student Senate Chair Matt 
McGarvey ofthe meeting, which 
lasted only about 10 minutes 
after Senate reached quorum. I 
was really glad  I believe the 
decisions made were good for 
the group and for Senate.
We have no opinion on the 
appropriateness of Senates ac
tion, said David Raffo, a second-year PhD student in GSIA 
and president of the Aikido at 
CMU Club. Before the resolu
tion was passed he was asked if 
the club had any objections to it, 
and he replied that the club did 
not.
The investigating committee 
was made up of Senators Chris 
Neighbor (CFA), who was Sen
ate chair at the time the com
mittee was formed, Amy Blake 
(CFA), co-chair of F&R, and
McGarvey. The committee was 
formed and the investigation 
begun because, said Neighbor, 
We had received some informa
tion from students in the organi
zation stating they felt there may 
be violations in fiscal and oper
ating procedures.
In the resolution passed by 
Student Senate, Aikido at CMU 
was charged with having an offcampus bank account, which is 
disallowed in Senates Fiscal 
Policy, distributing flyers with
out the notice funded by Stu
dent Senate, which is required 
on printed publicity for an event 
paid for by Activities Fee money, 
and not disclosing all financial 
activities to Funding and Recog

Analysts review two presidential hopefuls
Perot must declare intent soon
WASHINGTON, April 23, (D J)  If Rosa Perot 
wants to be president, he should begin making 
some presidential moves right now.
That is the consensus of The Wall Street Journals 
panel of political experts, who think he should 
declare his intention to run soon, and even pick 
his vicS presidential running mate. The best bet, 
if hed take it: Paul Tsongas.
Three of the four political pundits suggest that, 
given the stunning personal weaknesses of Presi
dent George Bush and Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkan
sas, Perot could emerge as one of the strongest 
third-party candidates in U.S. history.
It could be a very serious challenge, says GOP 
strategist John Sears. Hes different, the year is 
different and the voters are of a mind to do 
something, and hes the natural heir to all ofthat.
Perot has three things going for him, says 
maverick GOP theoretician Kevin Phillips, the 
fact that record numbers of Americans think the 
country is going in the wrong direction, that the 
two other candidates have such incredible weak
nesses, and that Perot has all that money to 
spend.
Only Democratic strategist Alan Baron is skep
tical. Id expect that by October, Perot would be 
down to the single digits in the national polls, 
says Baron. He really doesnt know a lot about 
these issues.
All the members of the panel agree that this is 
shaping upasoneof the most intriguing national 
elections in many years  and surely one of the 
most unpredictable. Bush, the panelists say, has 
little room to maneuver. His chances rise and fall 
on the state of the economy.
If business conditions improve significantly, 
and the voters sense the movement, he obviously 
benefits. As the economy gets better, theres less 
intense desire for change, says Schneiders. Bush 
turns out to be the one candidate representing 
stability.
Sex in the Voting Booth
Voting Among 18to 24-Year-0lds by Gender, 1972-1986
50%
40%
For Clinton  whom the panelists all presume 
will be the Democratic nominee  the challenge 
is to quickly put behind him discussions of his 
character, and start talking about Bushs policy 
weaknesses and his own ideas for getting the 
country moving.
Among all the 
candidates, only 
Perot comes re
ally close to being 
master of his own 
destiny. But, 
says Schneiders,
he has to pass 
certain tests as a 
presidential can
didate, and we 
dont know if he 
can. If he fails to 
measure up as a 
convincing presi
dential candidate, 
the panelists ag
ree that Perot 
would take more 
votes from Bush 
than from Clin
ton.
But if he does 
demonstrate po
litical skills, says.
Sears, he could
win the election. Schneiders agrees. Sears sees a 
scenario in which national polls this fall show 
Perot running second to Bush. If you become the 
second man, he says, youve got a damn good 
chance to win.
Phillips thinks the only way Perot could actu
ally win requires what he calls a third-stage 
downturn in the economy combined with another 
round of exposes about Bill Clinton."
Clinton will support big business
April 24, (DJ)  Arkansas 
Gov. Bill Clinton is running for 
president as a populist for the 
1990s. He frequently launches 
rhetorical grenades at big busi
ness and calls for measures forc30%

ing them to spend more on train
ing and to reduce bloated execu
tive salaries. His proposals for 
investment tax incentives in
clude a conspicuous tilt away 
from big companies and toward 
smaller ones.
But a look at his record in 
Arkansas, where he has been
governor for 12 of the past 14 
years, suggests that despite the 
rhetoric, a President Clinton 
might be more collegial than con
frontational toward business, 
The Wall Street Journal re
ported. Clinton has always had 
good rapport with the so-called 
business leadership, says 
Charles Murphy Jr., a former 
chairman of the Arkansas Busi
ness Council and chairman of 
Murphy Oil Corp., one of the 
states largest companies.
Deference to big business is a 
tradition among Arkansas gov
ernors that is as old as the Ozark 
hills. The reasons are self-evident. Though Arkansas is one of 
the nations poorest states in 
both per-capita income and em
ployment, it also is home to some 
of the countrys richest individualsand largest corporations. The 
Arkansas Business Council, 
widely known here as The Good 
Suit Club, has had among its 
members top executives of WalMart Stores Inc., Stephens Inc., 
one of the largest investmentbanking firms away from Wall 
Street. By one estimate, the 20 
or so executives who have been 
members of the council control 
more than 10 percent of the 
states one million jobs.
Some observers say the gover
nor tends to do whatever is 
needed to accommodate busi
ness. If Clinton reaches the 
White House, he is more likely
to keep open his dialogue with 
business. He does not think that 
government can fail to have.,a 
partnership with the private 
sector, says Betsey Wright , .a 
former top aide.
In Arkansas, the effects of 
Clintons business courtship are 
evident. The governor boasfs 
thathis policies have helped saye 
thousands of jobs that other
wise would have fled the state. 
But critics cite the states envi
ronmental problems as evidence 
of the downside of his policies. 
As governor Clinton has leaned 
more toward the developmental 
issues, says Mahlon Martin, 
president of the Winthrop 
Rockefeller Foundation and a 
former Clinton appointee. The 
result, he says, has created an 
environmental problem. -
Arkansas waterways are 
heavily polluted. The state has 
been ranked last for its environ
mental initiatives and 48th over
all for its environmental condi
tions by the Green Index.
Another area that shows the 
effects of a tilt toward business 
is Arkansas tax system. Taxes 
here are decidedly regressive. 
The system relies heavily on 
sales taxes, imposes low sever
ance taxes for such resources as 
natural gas and timber and 
places the same 7 percent in
come-tax rate on individuis 
earning $25,000 a year as those 
earning $25 million.EPA pollution rule in conflict with Bushs policy
WASHINGTON, April 24, (AP)  
President George Bush is expected to 
side with the White House Competi
tiveness Council and against the Envi
ronmental Protection Agency on an airpollution rule that has become the big
gest test of his deregulatory initiative, 
The Wall Street Journal reported.
While Bush hasnt made a formal 
decision, administration officials said 
he supports the councils effort to 
weaken the important rule included in 
the 1990 Clean Air Act.
The issue comes to a head as the 
administration plans to start a big pub
lic relations effort today to highlight its 
commitment to oppose what adminis
tration officials call excessive govern
ment regulation.
The administration plans to extend
the 90-day moratorium on new regula
tions that was announced by Bush in 
his State of the Union address in Janu
ary and that expires Tuesday. But aides 
have also planned a series of announce
ments through the week, including 
plans for streamlined banking rules as 
well as adjustments to transportation 
and securities regulations, that are in
tended to reassure the administrations 
conservative and business allies.
Bushs decision on the air-pollution 
rule would mark the biggest victory yet 
for Vice President Dan Quayle in his 
effort to weaken environmental regu
lation and would be a major gain for the 
regulatory moratorium. It would be a 
significant loss for EPA chief William 
Reilly, and critics are likely to use the 
decision to attack Bushs claim to be an
environmentalist.
Of course we will abide by a presi
dential decision, an aide to Reilly said. 
But as of yet we have not been noti
fied.
At a White House meeting Wednes
day, top officials failed to resolve their 
differences overthe Clean Air Act rules, 
which would require businesses with 
pollution permits to seek regulatory 
approval when they change operations 
in ways that could increase emissions. 
The Competitiveness Council has been 
looking at the rules as part of a larger 
review of regulations aimed at reduc
ing burdens on business.
Reilly had argued that citizen groups, 
by law, must have ample opportunity 
to challenge such changes. Quayle and 
the council disagreed and have appar
ently won the presidents support for 
their position, which would weaken 
public-notice requirements for small 
changes.
Although the dispute over the per
mits rule has drawn the most atten
tion, Bush aides over the past few weeks 
have put together a host of measures to 
underscore their deregulatory push. 
The effort will be anchored by a speech 
at the White House Wednesday in which 
Bush will extend the regulatory mora
torium for several months.
Friday, the White House announced 
a package of banking initiatives de
signed to streamline financial regula
tion, according to administration offi
cials.
One new initiative is an agreement 
between the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. and the Conference of State 
Bank Supervisors to end duplicate 
bank exams for 8,000 state-chartered 
banks. Under the accord, the FDIC and 
state examiners will alternate years in 
examining the healthiest banks and 
will worktogether to devise exam sched
ules for weaker banks.
The package also includes some pro
posals the administration had sought 
in banking legislation rejected by Con
gress. For example, it would combine 
various bank regulators into a single 
agency.

two ABM custodians. They led 
the officer to the north end of the 
building, where there were four 
framed photographs displaying 
graphic homosexual activities. 
Alongside the photos was a small 
piece of paper which contained 
what seemed to be personal 
attacks on members of the Art 
Faculty and comments by 
another person who may have 
been offended by the display. 
The two custodians felt that the 
display was offensive and made 
their workplace uncomfortable. 
The lack oflabeling led the officer 
to believe that the work was not 
sanctioned, so the photos and 
accompanying materials were 
removed and taken to the 
Campus Police office. Chief 
LaPaglia and Dean Murphy will 
meet with Dean Burgess to 
resolve the issue.

Yeakel speaks at CMU
YEAKEL, from page 1
With the slogan Getting 
Pennsylvania to Work Again, 
Yeakel plans to focus on issues 
such as health care, reproduc
tive freedom for women, the 
capital gains tax, childrens 
issues, increased funding chan
neled toward energy and envi
ronmental concerns, a reduc
tion in the defense budget by 
one third or $100 billion, as 
well as many other issues. She 
says, The campaign is not my 
campaign. Its our campaign, 
and feels its important to send 
to Washington a voice that rep
resents those in Pennsylvania 
without a voice  and that is 
most of us.
Yeakel briefly responded to 
several questions, including 
one very important to her re
garding the Reproductive Act. 
A spectator asked what Yeakel 
personally believed the chances
for the passage of the Repro
ductive Act were over a presi
dential veto. Yeakels response 
was it depends on who is in 
the Senate. Yeakels campaign 
literature informs voters that 
[the] U.S. Supreme Court". 
President Bush, and other op
ponents of reproductive choice  
not only threaten safe and le
gal abortion, they threaten the_ 
ability of all women to use birth 
control and to obtain high quality prenatal and maternity care' 
as well as comprehensive' 
health services for themselves 
and their children.
After speaking for 25 min
utes, Yeakel thanked the crowd_ 
and departed. Supporter Jane_ 
Becker said upon Yeakels de7 
parture, I truly believe shewill win the primary.... I mean 
it when I say we need someone' 
to rid Washington of the greedmerchants.

Senate cuts Aikido budget
AIKIDO, from page 1
veiy busy working with students
 thats our primary job, said 
Raffo. Were a young organiza
tion, and we were not clear on 
wh'at [Senates] requirements 
were. There seem to be a lot of 
clubs in the same boat.
 According to Aikidos consti
tution, the president [Raffo] is 
supposed to know everything 
relating to Senate, said Neigh
bor.
Neighbor also said Raffo 
should have received a copy of 
tte notebook from the fiscal 
management workshops spon
sored by Senate twice a year for 
presidents and treasurers of 
clubs. Raffo saidhe was notgiven 
the' book.
The resolution recommends 
that the [Senate] subsidy for 
fiscal year 1991-92 be repaid in 
full.... That the budget for fiscal 
year 199293 be revoked.
That Student Senate recog
nize Aikido at CMU to also en
compass the names Aikido in 
Oakland and Three Rivers 
Aikikai. One year of Probation 
as outlined in the Student Sen
ate Fiscal Policy, to commence 
on the first day of May 1992.
A group put on probation by 
Senate is required to clear all 
activities with the executive com
mittee of Senate, according to 
the Student Senate Fiscal Policy.
The resolution also recom
mends that Dean of Student 
Affairs [Michael Murphy] con
sider whether the group has been 
involved in any violation of Uni
versity policy.
Regarding this recommenda
tion, which was one made origi
nally to F&R by the investiga
ting committee, Neighbor said, 
After initial review, the com
mittee felt there were indica
tions that there were possible 
acts outside Senates jurisdic
tion. Murphy declined to com
ment for reasons of confidential
ity.
Some members of Senate are 
disturbed by the secrecy sur
rounding the committees ac
tions.
Senate does not have a man
date for secrecy, said Senator 
Eric Moore (MCS), chair of the 
Rules Committee. The forma
tion of a committee should be 
approved by [the executive com
mittee of Senate (excomm)]. 
What Blake and Neighbor did is 
what I would do if I wanted to go 
on a witchhunt after an organi
zation.
When Neighbor was chair of 
Senate, he says, he ran excomm 
meetings informally.
I said in an excomm meeting 
that a special committee was 
being established that was look
ing into one of the clubs. Every
one said, Well, okay, and that 
was it. [Moore] missed that meet
ing.
McGarvey said, The Student 
Senate [disclosure] policy is in 
conflict with the Universitys
PIZZA
policy regarding confidentiality. 
There was information we re
ceived that we wanted to keep 
confidential to protect one of the 
students involved.
Moore said he'is primarily con
cerned for the protection of stu
dents. The prospect that this 
can occur terrifies me. These 
rules exist to protect the stu
dents, and Neighbor got around 
some of the more importantpro
tect the students ones. I dont 
think this is forgivable, he said. 
All records are publicly avail
able [according to the Senate 
constitution], so secrecy isnt 
allowed.
AnnWitchner [assistant dean
of Student Affairs] or Tim Fos
ter [assistant to the dean of Stu
dent Affairs] sat in on every 
meeting to ensure fairness and 
due process, said Neighbor. It 
comes down to separate inter
pretations of our constitution.
Minutes, final reports, and 
correspondence, strictly legally, 
are the documents that are in
cluded in must be available for 
review. Our Rules Chair [Moore] 
believes the documents should 
include everything that comes 
into the committees hands. 
Theres information there that 
it would be improper to release 
because its beyond the scope of 
Senates power to act.

FORUM
Thistles and Thorns 91 -92
Its time again for Thistles and 
Thorns, our chance to tell the 
world exactly what we think 
about people, organizations, and 
events  both on campus and 
off. Thistles are year-end re
wards for those we think have 
done a good job and deserve a 
pat on the back. Thoms are a 
message to those we see as need
ing improvement or who have 
just messed up completely.
Student Senate, everyone's fa
vorite organization, deserves 
multiple Thistles and Thorns 
this year. The first Thistle is a 
thanks for giving us so many 
wonderful editorial topics. The 
fact that Senate appeared at 
times to be deaf to students and 
their concerns earns it a Thom. 
The PR committee deserves a 
Thistle for its advertising cam
paign for the referendum and 
elections, and Senate as a whole 
gets a Thistle for having an elec
tion work  finally.
Those students who voted in 
the elections and the referen
dum deserve a Thistle, but those 
who didnt get a Thom. Voting 
is a responsibility, not a luxury, 
and we applaud those who fol
lowed through with this respon
sibility. Considering the impor
tance of elections and the refer
endum vote, we feel that The 
Student Union deserves a Thom 
for its Voting Guide and for 
Mel Roos ROTC cartoon. Both 
were clear examples of biased 
and irresponsible journalism.
The issue of discrimination by 
the Department of Defense 
(DoD) and, by association, 
ROTC, was a hot topic on cam
pus this year. We would like to 
send the DoD a huge Thorn for 
its discriminatory policy toward 
gays, lesbians, and bisexuals. 
While were on the topic of in
sensitivity, SAE and PiLam get 
Thorns for their party posters, 
which were simply in bad taste.
On the sports scene, we have 
several Thistles to pass out. The 
football team deserves one for 
going 9-1 in the fall, and 
womens basketball earned a 
Thistle by placing second in the 
UAA. Womens soccer went var
sity this year, and the team 
members get a Thistle for their 
hard work. Swimming also de
serves a Thistle for its achieve
ments. The hockey club won the 
West Penn College Hockey As
sociation League Champion
ship, for which it gets a Thistle 
as well.
Scotch N Soda gets a Thistle 
for 85 years of theater, and for 
Jack!, the great spring show. 
The Thistle yearbook 1992 and 
editor Kathryn Coonrod earn a 
Thistle for putting out a book on 
time. The Thistle 1990 also gets 
a Thistle for finally making an 
appearance  in December 
1991.
A Thistle goes to CMAP for 
expandingits program to include 
Hispanic students.
The panel of sexual harass
ment advisors, headed by Katie 
Stannard in Student Affairs, 
gets a Thistle. Its about time 
the administration admits that 
such a panel is necessary to the 
campus community. The Alumni 
Mentor Program dropped the
ball at the beginning of last se
mester through organizational 
and communication failures, 
and for that has earned a Thom. 
CMU as a whole gets a Thistle 
for ranking in the top 25 schools 
in nation, while simultaneously 
earning a Thom for dropping 
from 22nd to 24th in the 
rankings.
CMDS has made some muchneeded changes in the dining 
establishments on campus, es
pecially Highlander, and for that 
we give it a Thistle. But the fact 
that it went into debt as far as it 
did earns it a Thom.
The plans for the University 
Center have been floating 
around for the past ten years. 
Wed have liked to offer the Cen
ter a Thistle, but our funding 
fell through. So instead, the 
University Center, and the ad
ministrators who were supposed 
to have delivered on the prom
ise of an improved student centeralongtimeago,getlO Thoms
 one for each year of delays 
and broken promises.
The International Festival 
earns both a Thistle and a Thom. 
The original concept, from the 
task force headed by Peter 
Stearns, deserves a Thistle. 
However, the publicity and plan
ning of the event left a great 
deal to be desired, and for that 
the Festival and its planners 
deserve a Thorn. We hope the 
event will be much improved in 
these areas next time around.
There are some individuals in 
the administration at CMU who 
deserve personal recognition. 
Tim Foster and Harriet 
Schwartz, the newest assistants 
to the dean of Student Affairs, 
each gets a Thistle for jumping 
right into the thick of things at 
CMU, and for doing a great job. 
We would also like to offer a 
Thistle to President 
Mehrabians moustache, for 
making the president identifi
able on the rare occasions we 
see him.
The newest deans at CMU, 
Susan Henry of MCS and Peter 
Stearns of H&SS, both get 
Thistles  we expect great 
things from you, and were sure 
youll deliver.
We want to send a big fat Thom 
to the thieves who stole comput
ers and equipment from both 
The Tartan and The Student 
Union in the past year. In light 
of the theft, SDC gets a Thistle 
for lending us a Mac when we 
were in need. Ross Comer earned 
a Thistle for offering us tempo
rary space on the Organizational 
Server. We really appreciated 
their help and concern.
Finally, wed like to offer 
Thistles to our graduating staff. 
Theyve made great contribu
tions to The Tartan over the 
years, and we will miss them. 
The graduates include: Jason 
McDonald, Tamara Liebert, 
Hans Wang, Thomas Nichols, 
Waseem Hussain, Rich Robin
son, Randy Udavcak, A. Frank
lin Wheeler, Farron Levy, Mary 
Yee, Craig Mrusek, ScottPakin, 
Andrew Plotkin, Nick Wardigo, 
Drew Olbrich, David Docktor, 
Kishor K. Rao, J. Anthony, and 
Cathy Saum. Thank you.
Letters to the Editor
Choice is misnomer in 
abortion debate lingo
on
the Editor
Editor:
Abortion has been a 
very vocal issue re
cently, both in The |_GttQr tO 
Tartan and in the na
tional news, as the 
Supreme Court begins discussion of 
the Pennsylvania abortion law that may 
(and will) overturn Roe vs. Wade.
It seems as though many of the argu
ments presented in The Tartan recently 
have been advocating the pro-abor
tion view. As 1992-93 co-directors of 
the Association for Life, we would also 
like to have our thoughts known as 
well.
First of all, the term choice is a 
misnomer. The aborted child has no 
say in.the manner whatsoever. The 
fetus (not a ball of cells as previously 
stated) is a small person, and this per
son should not be forced to die for con
venience. Secondly, abortion-rights ad
vocates have been trying to impress 
upon us the idea that the woman should 
have the right to govern what happens 
to her body. This is true before preg
nancy, but the woman gave up part of 
that right when she consented to sex 
and to its consequences. She should not 
have entered into sex without concern 
for the possible results, which include 
pregnancy. She now has a most impor
tant responsibility, to herself and her 
unborn child.
Lastly, and most importantly, life is 
the most apparent and necessary 
choice. No one has the right to tell a 
baby that he or she does not have the 
right to live. Motherhood is very diffi
cult, especially when entered into by an 
unprepared, young woman. But moth
erhood is also the most correct choice. 
Sometimes, the best things in life are 
difficult to accomplish, but very reward
ing. The child should not be eliminated 
because of a someone elses mistake.
We could go on, but I think everyone 
sees our point. I hope and pray that 
women, young and old, who face this 
difficult decision will make the correct 
choice. Choose life, not abortion.

Reader responds to 
three points on abortion
onEditor:
The argument may 
go on forever; the pre
mises of pro-life and LcttST tO 
pro-choice arguments r
are the proverbial Editor
apples and oranges, perhaps impos
sible to compare. Nevertheless, I feel 
compelled to add my opinion in re
sponse to letters printed in last weeks 
Tartan. I have three main points to 
respond to. One concerns the Pope. Hav
ing been raised a Catholic, I am quite 
aware that the Pope is not in favor of 
choice when it comes to a woman hav
ing control over her own body. Nor do I 
believe that anyone would take a state
ment to the contrary seriously. I sug
gest that this was a humorous attempt 
to convey the pro-choice point of view, 
certainly not a reason for the signbearer to apologize to every Catholic or
pro-lifer. Lighten up people! Two has to 
do with the assertion that pro-choice is 
a misnomer. Pro-choice is NOT pro
abortion; it is exactly what it says it is. 
The vast majority of pro-choice sup
porters have never had an abortion, or 
ever will. Despite my pro-choice beliefs, 
I do not know if I could ever have an 
abortion. It is a terrible and difficult 
decision for any woman to face, but it 
should still remain her choice. That is 
the basis of the pro-choice movement: 
that each individual does indeed have 
control over what happens to her body 
or in other words, that each individual 
has the right to control her own life. 
This brings me to my third point: the 
supposed innocent victim that all prochoicers are forgetting about. Prochoicers are not a group of genocidal 
barbarians out to make every woman 
abort babies. While perpetuating the 
idea of the fetus as innocent victim, 
pro-lifers ignore the fact that the woman 
is a thinking, caring entity with rights 
of her own  including the right to 
make what she believes are the best 
decisions regarding her future and the 
future of any children she may have.
I believe everyone would like to live 
in a world without abortion. Perhaps 
when there is comprehensive sex edu
cation, when all people are taught about 
the responsible use of birth control, 
when babies are not bom into poverty 
or unlivable conditions, when women 
are not impregnated by rape or sexual 
abuse, perhaps then abortion will not 
be necessary and legislating what 
women do with their bodies will be
come a non-issue.

As a teacher, you feel hurt, sad, and 
ineffective when you see some of your 
best students in class behave insensi

That is how the recent sexist actions by 
some fraternities made me feel.

Reader challenges 
Loomis understanding
Editor:
On behalf of Bnai 
Brith Hillel, a Jewish 
campus organization, LfittGf tO
we would like to ex- emHH
press our support of Editor 
The Tartan in its handling of Bradley 
Smiths Holocaust revisionism ad. Hillel 
had anticipated the potential of the 
impact of Holocaust revisionism on the 
campus community. Carnegie Mellon 
is only one of a growing number of 
universities around the United States 
to which this same ad was submitted. 
In denying the realities of the Holo
caust, the ad sends a message to us, as 
Jewish members of the campus com
munity, that we do not belong; the 
papers stand is a message of inclusion.
The ad, which refers to the horren
dous events of the Holocaust as a story, 
a legend, and a myth, is very dis
turbing. We, like many other organiza
tions and individuals, believe that the 
tragedies of the Holocaust should never 
be forgotten. To further add to our con
cern, we feel that it is appropriate to 
note that the ad was submitted to The 
Tartan at an especially poignant time
 dining the holiday of Passover, in 
which Jews recall their freedom from 
slavery, and with Yom Hashoa (Holo
caust remembrance day) approaching 
on April 30.
The objective of Bradley Smith and 
the Committee for Open Debate on the 
Holocaust is to contaminate campuses
onEditor:
Mike Loomis made 
a number of infuriat
ing statements in last |_etter to 
weeks Tartan and I $C PHitnr 
would like to respond l"e call:or 
to a few of them. He asserts that atti
tudes of fraternity members merely 
reflect the prevailing attitudes on cam
pus and that members should there
fore not have to endure protest be
cause attacking these organizations or 
their actions will not make sexism go 
away. This is not only a cop-out but a 
serious error in judgment. The frater
nities are a prominent and influential 
social force on campus and are there
fore going to be logical aud justifiable 
targets for campus reform. Whether or 
not they are bastions of inappropriate 
behavior an assertion that Loomis feels 
compelled to defend them against, de
pends on who you ask. But putting that 
debate aside, one can still recognize the 
strong role these organizations play on 
campus which could therefore be used 
to affect change in both attitudes and 
standards of behavior.
Loomiss patronizing distinction be
tween sexuality and sexism is very re
vealing about his inability to under
stand the issues involved in this con
troversy. He has made the common 
mistake of assuming that his andmany 
other males notion of what defines sexu
ality is the same as that for all women.

Final chapter will answer all your questions
^ JasonMcDonald
There is a certain sickening aspect to 
The Final ColumnI keep getting the 
feeling I should be reclining in a leather 
chair with a pipe and a cognac, telling all 
those When I Came Here Many Moons 
Ago stories that I hated when previous 
seniors told them to me. However, Ive 
figured out a way to make things simple. 
Here are my answers to The Top Ten 
Questions Everyone Keeps Asking Me.
Do you have a job yet ?
Nope. I had planned to take the sum
mer off anyway, so my job search lacks a 
certain sense of urgency. Also, I dont 
have anything more than a very general 
idea of what I want to do. Ive got sit at 
a desk, answering a phone, and looking 
at documents down, but other than 
that, my goals are kind of vague.
How about graduate school ?
Does one ask the convict if he or she 
wants to do a few more years in prison? 
College was easy to cope with because 
its a necessity in todays job market, but 
grad school, at this point in my life, just 
reeks of masochism. Actually, I may go 
back for a higher degree some day, but 
right now I just want out. Being this 
close to the finish makes it difficult to 
think of anything else.
Do you plan on keeping in touch with 
the University and the people you know 
here?
Well, it goes without saying that Id
like to come back as often as possible (Ive 
already made a tentative commitment to 
push buggy in the alumni races next 
year), but theres a discouraging tradi
tion facing me. I made all the same prom
ises when I left high school, and I went 
back once. Same bleak outlook for keep
ing in touch with people  of my high 
school friends, there are only two that I 
see regularly anymore. Id like to think 
my college ties are stronger than my high 
school ties, but well just have to see.
Are you going to give money to the 
University down the road?
When the Pitt alumni people asked my 
friend, Michael, to give them money, his 
answer was simply beautiful. He simply 
enclosed a copy of the newspaper article 
detailing the million-dollar retirement 
package for ex-Pitt chancellor Wesley 
Posvar along with a note that said, You 
get nothing, and this is why.
no. Warner Hall gets nothing, and that is 
why.
What is your favorite memory from 
your four years at CMU?
While I dont have a Deans List semes
ter to nominate, there are several prime 
contenders. One of my friends wants me 
to go with the childish acceptance that 
came from getting drunk and passing out 
into a barbeque pit.
That was definitely a Kodak moment, 
as was pushing buggy for Pioneers  as 
an aside, Pioneers, as a whole, is one 
organization I wish I had given more than 
a year tobut in all honesty, the moment 
Ill remember most is the CMU womens 
basketball team beating Washington 
University on its home floor last year. 
Hard to believe an athletic moment would 
shine so bright at a Division III school, but 
thats just me.
How about your least favorite?
Unwritten liquor licenses and sexist attitudes 
are OK, but free expression of dissatisfaction is 
a no-no. Warner Hall gets nothing, and that is why.
My answer is similarly nested in a 
single example (though constantly rising 
tuition and the non-existent University 
Center make my choice a more comfort
able one): that Student Affairs had the 
gall to go after a student for sending a 
shredded Carnegie Mellon magazine to 
Mehrabian while coddling the microcosm 
of arrested adolescence on the Fraternity 
Quad is just ludicrous. Unwritten liquor 
licenses and sexist attitudes are OK, but 
free expression of dissatisfaction is a noAn even tougher choice. My first and 
only Tartan Lean burger ranks up there. 
BA-DUM TCCHHHHHH! That was my 
obligatory Henny Youngman joke, folks. 
Actually, the worst is a class of memories
 the repeating scenario of watching 
Mends of mine leave this school because 
Financial Aid pulls the monetary rug out 
from under them. Not only that, but Im 
definitely glad to leave behind the callous, 
Oh, gee! You lost your money. So what? 
attitude (speaking from my own experi
ences) that it takes as it dangles aid like 
string in front of a cat.
Do you think you received a good edu
cation?
I suppose so, though what I learned in 
the classroom isnt half as useful as what 
I learned outside of it. The professors I 
had were very good (no doubt better than 
a lot of other schools), but most of lifes 
useful lessons dont happen in the class
room.
If you could do something different, 
what would it be?
Id have taken a wider variety of classes 
early on in my career. The curriculum is 
so goal-driven that theres almost no room 
to explore the vast options available here. 
As a result, I found out far too late that 
there were interesting courses to be found 
outside the IM department. Oh well. Hind
sight is indeed 20/20.
How about some advice for the future 
generations?
Sure. There is no such thing as Pitts
burgh weather, the male-to-female ratio 
is only a problem if youre a complete 
toad, the phys. ed. karate class is a great 
stress break, and PHI is too expensive if 
you like good beer. Thats about it.
Sum it all up for us. What did you 
think of your CMU experience?
Theres a lot of sentimental stuff I could 
say about the friends Ive made and the 
things Ive learned, but Ill save the Old 
Yeller ending for graduation day. For 
now, lets just keep it simple  it sure 
beats Pitt.

who have put up with him over the course 
of the past four years. See you on the 17th!
Letters to the Editor
LETTERS, from page 6
Of course its hard for him to 
understand why anyone would 
have a problem with something 
that seems so naturally appeal
ing to him. What he can try to 
understand, however, is that 
when women are uncomfortable 
with, angry at, or even just plain 
tired of having imposed on them 
mens definition of them as 
sexual beings, they are not be
ing puritanical, intolerant, or 
even misguided fools who cant 
recognize the real problems 
womenface. And they dont want 
his sympathy any more than 
SAE needs Student Senates 
sympathy for any indignation 
they might have felt as a result 
of the protest. They just want 
change.
Loomis makes one good dis
tinction in that censorship is not 
an appropriate means to better 
society. The women who agree 
with this principle, and there 
are many who do, have no direct 
means to stop fraternities or 
other organizations from pro
ducing posters of this kind.
But they do have the right to 
express how they feel without 
people like Mike Loomis trying 
to impose his judgment about 
how that act should have been 
performed as well.

Leader of protest 
replies to column
Editor:onHaving orga
nized the protest against Letter to
S'S Itor
poster, I awaited publication of 
The Tartan, hoping academic 
discourse would occur as a re
sult of the protest. I was pleased 
to see so much coverage of gen
der discrimination (April 20 is
sue). I hardly expected the pro
test to result in a column writ
ten about me!
I am responding to a few state
ments exerted by columnist Rich 
Robinson. First and foremost, I 
have not attended a fraternity 
party at Carnegie Mellon or any 
other university/college in three 
years. I now submit my resolu
tion that I will never attend a 
CamegieMellonfratemity party 
as long as I live. Careful report
ers check their sources, yet no 
Tartan reporter contacted me to 
verify my whereabouts Carni
val weekend.
Second, Robinson implies that 
the protesters were just gloryhunting. The protesters as a 
group had a clear goal, namely 
to open minds to mistreatment 
of women, not close those minds 
via intolerance, puritanism, 
and a disrespect for First Amend
ment rights. My personal goal 
was to start a war on Carnegie 
Mellons campus and then leave 
them to fight it out themselves, 
the results of which have been 
reassuring. Perhaps the most 
fallacious statement by Rob
inson, is that I am close-minded 
because I only want to argue 
with Dean Murphy about sex
ism, not resolve the problem. 
To that statement I ask this: 
who denied whom his ear? Dean 
Murphy, not I, said he did not 
have any interest in talking to 
me. How sad that an adminis
trator who is the students liai
son acted so close-minded him
self. Ultimately, the protest HAS 
resultedin action. Had Robinson 
bothered to check his sources....
The protesters sent a letter to 
the national chapter of Sigma 
Alpha Epsilon, requesting a re
dress of grievance in the form of 
disciplinary action.
Lastly, I comment on single
sex education: When discrimi
nation against women ends, so 
will the need for womens col
leges.
To end on a positive note: I 
congratulate The Tartan and the 
students of Carnegie Mellon 
University for tackling contro
versial issues in a public forum. 
That, is truly respectable aca
demic dialogue.

Column on sexism 
sets off reaction
Editor:
I have be
come more and 
frusO
because women are willing par
ticipants in pornography that 
its acceptable. It seems women 
want to do this. Some women 
may, but did he ever examine 
why the others do it?
Women participate in pornog
raphy, prostitution, and other 
body-oriented work because it 
pays them more than any job 
where they use their brain 
would.
Women are paid less than men 
for performing equal tasks.
This is the fullest manifesta
tion of sexism. This is the prod
uct of a male-dominated world. 
Some people might ask, Well, 
why do women concede to do 
this anyway?
It is because their self-esteem 
has been lowered consistently 
by graphic depictions of them
selves in subordinate positions. 
The way to remove sexism is not 
necessarily to attack pornogra
phy, but to teach women, to con
vince them not to participate in 
activities that perpetuate the 
myth of female subordinance. It 
is vital to the womens move
ment that men not only stop 
portraying women as sex objects 
but that women stop volunteer
ing to be them.

the true manifestations of it.

cerning Bradley Smiths adver
tisement entitled The Holocaust 
Controversy: The Case for Open 
Debate. In my opinion, you have 
done the campus community a 
disservice and you have treated 
us like children.
First, I fully agree with the 
board that this is not an issue of 
freedom of speech. The Tartan 
has the right to reject or con
dense any ad, column, letter, or 
other submission, and Smith is 
not being silenced for his views. 
What you did, however, was in
sult the campus and lend implicitfuel, ifyou will, to Smiths 
fire.
The ad should have been 
printed as either part of the news 
article or as part of the editorial. 
Your method of excerpting only 
brings into question what Smith
was really stating. As Im sure 
you know, excerpting is a dan
gerous thing if not done prop
erly. You can take just about 
any printed statement, and, us
ing the right quotes in the right 
places, make it seem as though 
the author thought something 
entirely different.
I am not saying that this was 
your intent, but you seemed to 
have totally disregarded such 
dangers.
Besides possibly misrepre
senting Smiths point of view, 
you have legitimized his posi
tion, regardless of how maturely 
you may have think you handled 
the issue. Smith and his sup
porters can now point to The 
Tartan and say, Youve got it all 
wrong. Youre spreading lies 
about us. That situation allows 
him to draw attention away from 
his truly anti-Semitic and bla
tantly false remarks.
If you are going to bring to 
light the debate over revisionist 
history and its interpretation of 
the Holocaust, you must show 
Smiths arguments in their en
tirety to the students. I am privi
leged in respect to the campus 
because I have had access to and 
have read his filth. Eveiyone 
else deserves the same access. 
Dont treat us like children and 
compound ignorance with only 
more ignorance. Let us read his 
argument and decide for our
selves.
To do any less is to not en
courage any sort of debate as 
you say about his writings.

Altmann questions 
editorial opinions

Lrtlmr to lh*
Editor:
In the April 
20 issue, the
Tartan pub- Letter tO lishedtwoedi- .. 
torials, one Editor
questioning the ethics of Stu
dent Senate, and the other ex
plaining the Editorial Boards 
approach to a revisionist adver
tisement regarding the Holo
caust. The Tartans treatment 
of both issues reflects a disturb
ing subtext of censorship.
The last phrase of the ethics 
editorial calls on Senators to 
pressure their colleagues to
ward appropriate behavior, re
ferring (as an example of inap
propriate behavior) to a motion 
by Senator Michael Loomis (included in the Senate minutes 
printed in the April 20 Tartan). 
After reading the editorial I was 
left with some questions. Just 
what constitutes ethical and 
appropriate behavior, in The 
Tartans eyes? And what sort of 
pressure is to be applied?
I put these questions to a rep
resentative from the editorial 
board during the April 21 Stu
dent Senate meeting, but 
learned nothing new from the 
response. I am left with the in
terpretation that the Editorial 
Board would prefer that Stu
dent Senate avoid debate of is
sues that could be found offen
sive. Disguised beneath the call 
forappropriatenesslurks acall 
to censor debate.
In the treatment of the revi
sionist ad, the Editorial Board 
chose a middle ground, seem
ingly. They printed an article, 
an editorial, and excerpts from 
the ad itself. The editorial ar
gued that to print the ad in full 
was to legitimize it  at first 
blush, a reasonable and innocu
ous approach. However, theres 
something pernicious about the 
notion that a text is outlandish 
enough to talk about but too 
outlandish to print. The prob
lems of censorship are manifold, 
but in this instance Im struck 
by three.
First is the patronizing atti
tude reflected in the decision to 
filter and predigest the material 
rather than deliver the full text 
along with the research and com
mentary. It would seem that we 
as readers are not properly 
equipped for exposure to some
thing so dangerous, and that its 
the Tartans role to feed it to us 
in pieces we cant misunder
stand.
Second is that censorship, 
when flaunted in this manner, 
only adds to the allure of the 
stupid ideas that are being par
tially suppressed.
Third is that I felt cheated: 
having read the excerpts, I 
wanted to read the ad in full and 
make my own analysis, in par
ticular of its rhetorical style.
In both the ethics editorial and 
the treatment of the revisionist 
ad, the Editorial Board cobbled 
together ad hoc criteria for cen
sorship. It concerns me that the 
board appears so willing to em
brace censorship as an instru
ment for modulating debate in 
the community.

8yRn yHEAHp w YHEpnhmn dnaarp w ,f skEma -bb,Politics, changes heated up the past year
^^^Chrlstiaj^n^estifo
Well, its the end of the year. 
The Tartan Editorial Board is 
conducting the inevitable dis
semination of Thistles and 
Thorns to everyone. No doubt, 
Jason McDonald'is summing up 
his four years here at Carnegie 
Mellon. So, in the tradition of 
the end of the year column, I feel 
that a wrap-up, if you will, is in 
order.
I must say that this year at 
Carnegie Mellon has been the 
most exciting here so far. In one 
year, I saw Carnegie Mellon 
transformed from a quiet, politi
cally ambivalent university into 
a hotbed of activity.
Anyone who reads the paper 
or watches the bboards undoubt
edly knows what Im talking 
about. And of course the nation 
and world were abuzz with ac
tivity.
When it came out, the Senate 
resolution against the DoDs dis
crimination against gays quickly 
divided the campus into two fac
tions. A great many people did 
many a moronic thing by quickly 
joining either side.
Those who quickly took up the 
cause of the resolution failed to 
see that many on the other side 
were opposed to discrimination. 
On the other hand, I saw a lot of 
people who thought those who 
stood for the resolution were
merely out to destroy ROTC at 
all costs.
Luckily, the more rational 
among us began toseetheother 
side, regardless of what position 
we took.
Unfortunately, there still re
mains a good deal of animosity 
towards Senate and those who 
supported the resolution in gen
eral.
While I still disagree with the 
exact wording of the resolution, 
I think all of us should keep a 
sharp eye out for those people 
who will undoubtedly attempt 
to blur the lines even more and 
open up old wounds. The day is 
on its way, and we should work 
to be ready for the repeal of the 
policy.
Along with all this ROTC de
bate came a plethora of argu
ments about Senate itself. When 
nine Senators who happened to 
be in ROTC were elected, people 
began screaming about a mili
tary takeover of Senate. That 
fear was quickly put to death. 
Many Senators feel that the 
ROTC Senators, as they are 
mistakenlyreferredto, are some 
of the most motivated theyve 
seen.
Then there are the internals 
of Senate itself, and the ques
tions ofits goals andits purpose. 
I wish that everyone who claims 
Senate should just dole out 
money would keep quiet. They 
dont know what they are speak
ing about. Senate has set up 
task forces to deal with bike
racks, FCEs, Physical Plant, 
CMDS, and other things. If you 
strip away the hype about reso
lutions and funding, youll find 
that underneath, Student Sen
ate is doing a lot for you. If you 
want them to do more, then talk 
to them. Dont just scream on a 
bboard.
This is not to say Senate is 
infallible. I still think a lot of
Pizza back. Mary Shelleys novel 
Frankenstein showed what hap
pens when you try to bring a 
dead thing back to life. Lets just 
hope the food at Highlander im
proves.
For the first time since her 
death over a year and a half 
ago, I truly felt sorry that my 
grandmother died when she did. 
If she had lived until last DeI must say that this year... has been 
the most exciting... so far. I saw 
Carnegie Mellon transformed from a 
quiet, politically ambivalent univer
sity into a hotbed of activity.________
work needs to be done with pub
lic relations, funding, and the 
issue of secret meetings. Shawn 
Knight has shown interest in 
being the Public Relations Com
mittee chair, and I think that he 
would do an excellentjob. Nowif 
students would just start taking 
an interest in Senate....
CMDS, it seems, had some 
rough times. They finally made 
some good changes, though. The 
new meal plans eliminate the 
problem of losing meals when 
you cant make it to the Tartan 
Grill before the end of the meal 
period. With the addition of a 
deli to Morewood Gardens and 
Highlander, its not all that bad. 
However, I still cannot fathom 
why they are bringing Morecember, she would have seen 
the birth, shortlife, and death of 
the Soviet Union. Her Ukrai
nian heritage and hatred of the 
oppressive system were indica
tive of a few of the forces that 
helped bring that empire to its 
well-deserved end.
Back here at home, things 
went the opposite way and be
came a little too conservative. 
Despite all the protests concern
ing sexual harassment and, 
more importantly, his lack of 
experience and qualifications, 
Judge Thomas was made a Su
preme Court Justice. Well know 
by the end of the summer how he 
feels about abortion, whether we 
like it or not.
Speaking of abortion, its be
come quite a hottopic. Im slowly 
beginning to agree with some 
thatiioe vs. Wade should be over
turned. Before the conservatives 
think theyve won me over, let 
me say that it will cause a back
lash, whether you like it or not. 
The pro-life forces will be 
ground to dust, as one person so 
aptly put it, when people realize 
that abortion is a question of 
personal freedom. And no 
amount of religious fervor or 
concern for the unborn will 
blind them.
The political arena is beginningtoheatup, and again people 
are becoming disenchanted. I 
wont vote for George Bush be
cause hes been so busy with 
foreign policy that domestic 
problems have gone to pot. I 
wont vote for any Democrat be
cause I simply dont see a good 
candidate.
I wouldnt vote for Perot if you 
held a gun to my head. Anyone 
who runs on the disenchantment 
of the people is a dangerous char
acter.
Personally, I think the Repub
licans have got to go. If we could 
find some Democrats willing to 
revamp the welfare system, put 
term limit restrictions on them
selves, install some real ethics 
in government, and intelligently 
scale down the military so we 
still have effective, fast response 
forces, then Ill vote for them.
That about wraps up the year. 
I would like to take the whole 
Forum section to review every
thing, but that would push out 
Jason McDonald. I figure I 
should give him one last chance 
since I get his space next year. 
Id like to thank everyone who 
took the time to read my col
umns and formulate intelligent 
responses, be they on email or in 
a letter to the editor. Id also like 
to thank Mary Kaye Rodgers, 
Tim Blass, and Aaron Jenkins, 
the three Forum editors Ive had 
the pleasure of working with. 
Special thanks go to all my 
friends and the members of 
Scobell A.
If theres anyone out there who 
reads things in The Tartan and 
in other papers, sees things on 
TV, or hears things on the radio, 
and gets furious or incredibly 
joyous, then I urge you to write 
for Forum.
As a columnist, you can hear 
the opinions and critiques of oth
ers before you write. Thus, even 
if they disagree with you, theyll 
offer suggestions as to how to 
improve your argument.
That and you get to tell over 
six thousand people what you 
think. Read the paper eveiy day 
over the summer, write some 
sample columns, and give them 
to the Forum editor at the re
cruitment meeting next semes

Quality of life after birth needs to be addressed
David Hunt
In the past few Tartans we have seen 
that the issue of abortion is highly 
charged, with strong views and emo
tions on both sides. Let me state up 
front that I am both pro-choice and 
anti-abortion. In fact, I daresay that no 
sane person is pro-abortion.
What bothers me about the pro-life 
view is the aftermath. It seems that the 
pro-lifers concern for the fetus ends 
after the birth. Politically, those who 
are pro-life also tend to be quite conser
vative. Acting through the past decades 
presidents, these conservatives have 
systematically gutted the provisions 
for adequate health care, education, 
and other necessities for a child to grow 
into a contributing member of society.
In effect, their actions say Once the 
brats born we dont care anymore. We 
dont need a bunch of self-righteous 
zealots trying to impose their beliefs on
us. We need adequate money and effort 
put towards constructive, realistic sup
port for children after theyre bom and, 
more importantly, comprehensive sex 
education for preventing unplanned 
pregnancies in the first place.
The irony is that there is no Biblical 
ban on abortion. The only law in the 
Old Testament that explicitly mentions 
fetuses concerns a woman who miscar
ries after being struck [Exodus 21:22]. 
The punishment for this crime is what
ever price the womans husband sets 
yet the Old Testament penalty for mur
der is a life for a life. By not command
ing that the offender be slain it is clear 
that the Bible, the word of God, does not 
consider a fetus a life!
Additionally, the actions of the Bit
ter Waters, which were used to test 
the fidelity of wives [Numbers 5:11 
31], sound like those of an herbal nos
trum meant to abort any potential bas
tard child. This is not only an implied 
abortion, it is a sanctioned abortion.
Dont forget Gods wholesale fetal 
slaughters. For example, God explic
itly ordered the deaths of all non-vir
ginal women from a people being con
quered [Numbers 31:17]. Since women 
who were not virginal could have been 
pregnant, it is likely that Gods order 
also condemned some number of fe
tuses.
Nor does the New Testament ever 
mention or imply any proscription 
against abortion.
While abortion is a drastic measure, 
I submit that bringing a life into the 
world only to have it know pain, fear, 
hunger, and worst of all, despair is an 
immorality that far outweighs abor
tion. We must not only consider the 
presence of life, but the quality of life.
In hospitals around the world termi
nally ill, elderly, and critically injured 
people are often hooked up to hoses, 
pumps, and other equipment. Some are 
in extreme pain  others are aware of 
their decaying mental faculties and 
dread the further loss of their funda
mental selves. There are those in irre
vocable comas  their bodies shriv
elled, their hands contorted into claws.
Despite this physical and emotional 
suffering, pro-lifers argue that active 
euthanasia (helping to die rather than 
merely allowing to die) is playing God.
They claim that only God should take 
life. However, remember that those 
people on heroic life support would have 
already been dead were it not for the 
artificial mechanisms keeping their 
bodies functioning. We are playing God
 by keeping people alive instead of 
letting them die.
The Right To Die movement has 
been gaining ground as more and more 
people come to realize the potential 
horror of a lack of life quality. Ive read 
of a case where the patients bones were 
so riddled with cancer that mere breath
ing caused rib fractures. With the aid of 
a compassionate doctor, her husband 
helped her die.
There are those who wish to escape 
their suffering, and it is time that we 
legally recognize the right to choose the 
time and manner of our own deaths.
Of course, there are those who do 
wish this option. I am not suggesting 
that people be killed simply because it 
is expedientif a person wants to live, 
then let him or her live. Gray areas in 
euthanasia arise when there has been 
no documented record of the persons 
wishes, or where there exists a reason
able chance of recovery.
There exists a tremendous potential 
for abuse, as people could be euthanized 
to save money or speed inheritances, 
among other reasons. In cases like this 
the family should be involved, but more 
importantly the friends of the person 
should be interviewed. Those with no 
motives other than that of helping a 
friend should be the more influential those, and a panel of medical doc
tors.
The quality of life affects us through
out life. The basic ability to achieve to 
your limits, if you choose, and not be' 
restricted by poverty, increases the 
quality of life. The abilities to not fear 
bullets or bombs in the middle of the 
night, to move, to breathe, to learn and 
think, all increase the quality of life.
These things and more all make life 
worth living. While abortion may be 
tragic, and euthanasia a wracking de
cision, is it not also immoral to insist 
that someone enter or stay in the world 
only to be denied a quality life?

cal engineering major.

Recently, while purchasing a 
meal in the Tartan Grill, I went 
over my allotted amount and had 
to put an apple back since I didnt 
have a cent on me. Aside from 
the fact that I felt silly as I guilt
ily returned the fruit (I could 
just imagine those behind me in 
line thinking: someones eyes are 
bigger than her meal plan), it 
made me realize how little extra 
money I keep handy  and, 
more to the point, how little I 
have in the first place. The 
minute a check is cashed, it burns 
a hole in my wallet. Where does 
it all go? (Most of it makes a 
beeline for the Cashiers Office, 
but thats another column.) In 
order to determine why I cant 
seem to hold on to money at 
Carnegie Mellon, I decided to 
investigate the evil consumer 
forces which compel me to give 
up my spendthrift ways.
For starters, there are your 
basic food expenses. Unless I feel 
like eating at one of Dining 
Services fine facilities or traips
ing over to Bunznudders for a 
hot fudge sundae, Entropy  a 
convenience store which 
charges only slightly less for a
medium-sized box of cereal than 
some of its employees make per 
houris my only recourse. Add 
clothing to that for the wacky 
t-shirts sold outside Doherty 
Hall, the ones with Carnegie 
Mellon ingeniously integrated 
into some product logo or a Top 
Ten list of Reasons Why Carn
egie Mellon can Engineer a Mars 
Robot  but cant Manage to 
Arrange a Drainage System for 
Campus Walkways that Doesnt 
Result in the Rice PaddyEffect 
at the Slightest Hint of Precipi
tation, and theres a good-sized 
chunk of my budget gone al
ready.
Entertainment on campus is 
another costly item. Sure, the 
one-dollar movies may look like 
a bargain, but at the end of the 
week, when paper money is just 
a sweet memory and Im scroung
ing up pennies and nickels from 
under my desk, that dollar is 
quite a hefty sum. Our Activi
ties Fee pays for a smorgasboard 
of free events and services, 
some of which are more worth
while entertainment-wise (cof
feehouses and concerts) than 
others (those full-page STOP 
THE MADNESS! ads). My only 
forms of truly free entertain
ment, I have glumly concluded, 
are reading The Tartans Crime 
and Incident Report and writ
ing vicious, malicious critiques
in the comments space on Fac
ulty Course Evaluations. Grim, 
indeed  but it certainly helps 
explain why keeping myself oth
erwise entertained consumes a 
larger-than-average portion of 
my dwindling disposable dollars.
What little is left after these 
expenditures goes directly to an 
AT&T office somewhere in 
Michigan. I cant understand 
this, since my long-distance 
phone policy is to call during 
off-peak hours when the rates 
are low. Using ice-water baths, 
Vivarin, techno music, and any 
other available means to keep 
myself awake until the SuperDuper Lo-Lo rate takes effect, I 
place the call and often manage 
to apologize for waking the re
ceiving party up at 4:30 in the 
morning before he or she slams 
down the phone in disgust. In 
the past, this has worked beau
tifully to keep costs down, par
ticularly since its spurred sev
eral of my friends to leave their 
phones off the hook or change 
their numbers without telling 
me. Yet each month my ACUS 
bill informs me that I owe some 
seemingly random, outrageous 
amount, like $839.42.
So whats the solution to these 
financial burdens? Calling home 
for money hasnt worked veiy 
well. My parents, caught in the 
time warp of the 40s and 50s
when everything  including a 
college education and a brandnew Ferrari Testarossacost a 
quarter, dont fully appreciate 
the imported beer may cost a 
little more but its worth it ar
gument.
Lately theyve started launch
ing into a lengthy description of 
homework done on a shovel by 
candlelight whenever the sub
ject of money comes up.
Typically when I start whin
ing about my lack of funds, in 
fact, most people tactfully ad
vise me to seek employment if I 
want more money. Yet, as Ive 
told them time and time again, 
there isnt much that a lazy, full
time college student such as my
self can do to earn extra cash. Or 
is there? Browsing through the 
bboards, that very phrase  
Earn Extra Cash!!!!  caught 
my ever-watchful eye.
It turns out that researchers 
who run experiments here actu
ally pay the subjects for partici
pating in them. And I am proud 
to say that I have made a minicareer out of it: my resum lists 
me as a Professional Guinea Pig 
for Carnegie Mellon. The fact 
that theres no dental plan is 
more than offset by payment up
front and in cash; and on-the-job 
hazards are kept to a minimum. 
The guy in the white lab coat 
himself assured me that the
experimnts are harmlless annd 
the ellectttrik shokcs< wonntt 
afect me at aall.

Little League 
 coaching 
at its best
Originally, my plans for the 
summer were going to include 
a cross-country drive. See 
America, visit friends, and 
enjoy that last summer of 
freedom before I fling myself 
into the real world. Unfortu
nately, those plans went on 
hold, leaving me up in the air 
as to what I could do this 
summer.
I thought about the standard 
ideas  part-time work, 
getting some sun, and then I 
remembered what it is I really 
wanted to do this summer. 
Thats right. If all goes well,
Im going to be a Little League 
coach.
The idea originally came up 
last semester when I bumped 
into Ralph DeStefano, my old 
coach, on my way from the bus 
stop to my house. We talked 
for a while, and he suggested 
that I should come on down 
next spring and help out. At 
the time, I gave the idea a 
noncommittal shrug and went 
home.
At the time, the encounter 
merely provided my daily 
supply of humor. This is the 
guy whose coaching staff 
consisted of whichever of his 
drinking buddies would make 
it to the field on a given day. 
This is the guy who made us 
run laps when we lost to the 
Astros, just because they were 
coached by a high school rival 
of his. In fact, before every 
season, he told us we could 
'ose every other game as long 
as we beat Lithgow  Beat 
Lithgow stood as the Cubs 
rallying ciy for all three 
seasons I played for them. 
Twenty-one, and the man is 
still calling me L.B. (Little 
Brother  my brother Jon 
and I were on the same team). 
The idea of me sitting in with 
Ralph and Company seemed 
pretty twisted.
So the reunion was tossed 
into the corner of my mind, 
seemingly forgotten. Then, 
this weekend, I read through 
the Edgewood newsletter to 
see what sort of idiotic plans 
were afoot in my community.
At the very bottom of the page 
was the reminder that entries 
were due for Little League.
My first reaction was a 
simple Yeah, right, but I 
thought about it a little more. 
True, Ralph was a bit strange 
from the perspective of a tenyear-old kid, but he was a 
pretty good guy. Other than 
the lap-running incident, he 
never really got angry at us, 
no matter how bad we some
times stunk. Besides, we were 
no angels either  I remember 
our bench taunting an Astros 
player to the point where he 
was too upset to keep playing 
(naturally, the kids dad 
blamed Ralph).
And of course, theres the 
thrill of vicarious living. Its 
usually only once or twice a 
summer that we get enough 
people together to play soft
ball, and wiffle ball in the 
street lacks that poetic freshcut-grass quality that were 
shooting for. What better way 
to get that team sport feeling 
than bossing around little kids 
for two months and change?
Besides, if hes still coaching, 
well get another shot at 
Lithgow.

Carnegie Mellon hosted the 
University Athletic Association 
track meet last weekend. Wash
ington Universitys men and 
Brandis women entered the 
meet as defending champions, 
and both teams knew they would 
have to put forth their best ef
fort to retain their titles. 
Brandis claimed its first title 
last year; Emory and University 
of Rochester won the years be
fore that, and they were strong 
enough to climb back to the top 
this year. Washingtons mens 
team has won thelastfour titles, 
and this years meet may have 
been the toughest competition 
yet. Close races were expected 
throughout the meet. Washing
ton was rightfully worried, as 
Rochester came out on top, win
ning the mens title with 127 
points; Washington followed 
with 121; with 100 points CMU 
men came in third, followed by 
Emory, Case Western Reserve, 
Chicago, NYU, and Brandis. 
CMU mens head coach, Gary 
Meckley, was named coach of 
the year.
Carnegie Mellons womens 
team came in sixth place overall

The CMU baseball team has 
been rained out of the majority 
of its games. According to head 
coach Neil Stoemell, this year 
CMU baseball is fielding one of 
its best teams ever. And they 
are being cheated out of a great 
season. Were strong in every 
position as long as everybody 
can make it to the games, said 
junior J.R. Yakubisin.
The team had three or four 
rained outgames,saidStoemell, 
before they got to play. Carnegie 
Mellons first win came on April 
6, against the University of 
Steubenville. The team managed
to win on a foreign field, with a 
score of 3-1.
A combined three pitchers 
threw a no-hitter at Steuben
ville. Sophomore John Knutson 
pitched three innings, senior 
captainMike Gess pitched three, 
and senior Mike Hensel pitched 
one. Gess also batted in two 
RBIs.
When at home, Carnegie Mel
lon plays at Mellon Park on the 
comer of Fifth and Penn Av
enues. The first home game this 
year was a disappointing loss to 
Beaver Community College, 6- 
12. Stoemell said there were a 
lot of errors [and the] pitching 
didnt do well.Theupside ofthe 
game was that there were quite
a few hits. Senior captains Mike 
Petrich and Gess each had three 
hits, and Yakubisin hit three 
out as well.
On April 16, the home scene 
changed as the Tartans smashed 
Penn State New Kensington 11 
7 in Mellon Park.
The team managed the win 
despite the fact that they didnt 
play that well, said Stoemell. 
Sophomore Ryan Schmiedl had 
four hits and three RBIs. An
other three hits and three RBIs 
came from senior Dave Beltz.
Petrich brought in four RBIs 
with his two hits. Freshman 
Dave Bennett brought in two 
RBIs with three hits. Stoemell 
said the team was hitting well,
and was able to outmuscle the 
Lions.
The Tartans met Penn State 
New Kensington again last 
week, this time embarrassing 
the Lions at their home field, 
17-0. Everybody hit the ball, 
said Stoemell.
Some of the highlights were 
Petrichs four hits and five RBIs
 three of Petrichs hits were 
home runs  Schmiedls four 
hits, senior Bob Bernards three 
runs, and senior Alan Horns four 
runs. Said Stoemell, We played 
extra good.
Knutsons pitching benefitted 
the team by keeping the other 
teams away from base. He struck 
out nine players in seven in
time of 15.66 seconds.
In the mens 400-meter, Tho
mas ran a 49.99-second race to 
place third. Isaacs came in sev
enth with a time of 51.13 sec
onds.
Maguire placed fourth in the 
100-meter dash with his finish 
time of 11.65 seconds. Maguire 
also competed in the 200-meter 
run. His time of 23.19 seconds 
gained him fifth place.
Pempel placed third in the 400- 
meter hurdles. He ran the race 
in 55.40 seconds.
In the mens discus, Lange 
placed fifth with a throw of 135''

By TRACY HAYES
Tartan Sports Editor
The University Athletic Association (UAA) golf 
championships were held last Monday and Tues
day at Quail Hollow Golf Club near Cleveland. 
Sophomore Nick Inkenhaus earned all-confer
ence honors at the match.
Inkenhaus, who placed ninth in a field of 34, 
shot a 36-hole total of 158 to lead the Tartans 
under head coach Rich Erdelyi to a fifth-place 
team standing. The University of Washington 
won the title with a score of 599, followed by 
Emory University (613), Washington University 
(640), Case Western Reserve University (643), 
Carnegie Mellon University (657), Brandeis (673), 
and New York University (721).
Carnegie Mellons sophomore Ed Lee placed 
19 th With ascoreofl65, while junior Matt Sullivan 
and sophomore Ryan Elliott tied for 20th place 
with 167. Junior Brent Jones finished 32nd with 
180 points.
Yesterday, the Tartans played a dual match 
against MIT. CMU came out on top with 329 
points. MITs score was 350. Lee and Inkenhaus
tied for first place with scores of 81 points each.
Today the Tartans will be defending their Engi
neers Cup Championship at Brae Bum Country 
Club near Boston. Last season, CMU won the title 
with an 18-hole score of330, led by medalist Sam 
Trinch who shot a 79. Other schools participating 
in the prestigious tournament are MIT, Worces
ter Polytechnic Institute, Rochester Polytechnic 
Institute, New Jersey Institute of Technology, 
and New York Institute of Technology.
The Engineers Cup will end the 1992 campaign 
for Carnegie Mellon. The Tartans posted a 2-2 
dual match record with victories over Washington 
& Jefferson College and Bethany College and 
losses to Duquesne University and Robert Morris 
College.
The Tartans placed third in the Washington & 
Jefferson Invitational and seventh in the 14-team 
field Speidel Invitational.
Elliott, an All-UAA performer last year, earned 
medalist honors in the win over Bethany and in 
the Washington & Jefferson Invitational with a 
72 and 82 respectively. Lee took the top spot with 
an 81 against W&J and an 80 in the Spiedel 
Invitational.
Gym facilities improved
By TRACY HAYES
Tartan Sports Editor
Last year, Student Senate 
published Report and Recom
mendations Concerning CMlTs 
Gym Facility. One of the rec
ommendations in the Gym Re
port was to form a committee for 
improving the gym facilities. 
This is the role that the Athletic 
Facilities Advisory Board 
(AFAB) has filled.
The committee, which consists 
of representatives from all the 
groups that use the gymstaff, 
faculty, and students  meets 
monthly. A progress report was 
released from AFAB showing the 
results of a campus survey and 
stating recent improvements to 
the gym facility.
The survey asked gym visi
tors to state the strengths and 
weaknesses of the gym. People 
were generally pleased with the 
;l0ng hours and the convenient 
.location of the gym. They appre
ciated that the facility is free to 
members of the CMU commu
nity, and that people use the 
facility with respect. Locker, 
towel, and soap services and good 
aerobics sessions were men
tioned positively.
While the survey showed that 
a few people enjoyed the amount 
of free weights in the gym, most 
were not pleased with the weight 
room. Visitors complained that 
the weight room is too small, 
and that the equipment there is 
abused.
One person thought the pools 
hours were good, but four were 
disappointed that the pool was 
not open enough. Those surveyed 
were also displeased with the 
equipment room hours on week
ends ; they thought that it should 
be open more.
Visitors want a place to walk 
indoors  treadmills would do.
The lack of squash and racquetball courts was also a source of 
dissatisfaction. People didnt like 
the floor of Thistle Hall, and the 
poor lighting (in the small gym 
especially). Many complained 
about the overall physical struc
ture of the gym; they think the 
gym is too small.
Overcrowding was an identi
fied problem, probably a result 
of the size of the facilities. Oth
ers complained that the facili
ties are not very clean, and a lot 
of equipment is broken.
Following are some of the im
provements that AFAB has 
made over the last eight months:
 Locker and Shower Rooms: 
Problems have been discussed 
with ABM supervisors. Workhas 
improved as all three ABM em
ployees are working regularly 
now. AFAB requested that some
one from ABM be present on 
weekend days for basic clean
ing, and there has been a notice
able improvement over the last 
six months. Soap dispensers 
were installed to decrease the 
amount of waste, and to make 
soap available consistently.
0 Pool Access: Recreational 
hours have been expanded in 
the evening. Student lifeguards 
are now more consistent as man
agement is cutting down more 
and more on work missed.
 Weight Room: To prevent 
abuse of equipment, there would 
need to be a supervisor around 
the clock; AFAB has provided 
what supervision it can afford. 
Nearly half of the department 
budget has been spent on re
pairs. Recently a new repairper
son was hired.
 Equipment Room: The room 
has been completely reorganized 
so that visitors can be better 
served. There are now student 
attendants to increase the hours 
into the evening and on weekforallundergraduatemajorsM.S.

end days.
 Other Equipment: Basket
ball rims are abused weekly, and 
they get repaired weekly. There 
are two new exercise bikes to 
make a total of six. Weekly re
pairs cost a lot of money.
Other improvements that the 
AFAB has made in the last eight 
months include the painting of 
Thistle Hall and the moving of 
Kiltie Band to better quarters in 
Donner.
 Three womens varsity teams 
have moved to Donner from a 
general locker room  this 
leaves more room for the gen
eral users.
Electrical outlets have been 
added in the womens locker 
rooms, and racks have been 
added in the gym for storage. 
New mats were purchased for 
club and recreational use.
Some policies have also 
changed to improve the facili
ties. The gym and pool hours are 
better publicized; they are posted 
and circulated around campus. 
Club sports can reserve the IM 
fields and the stadium.
The Athletic Director, John 
Harvey, and the director of ABM 
make daily checks on the qual
ity of the cleaning routine.
The number of aerobics classes 
has doubled in the last year. The 
gym building is now open 18 
hours on weekdays and 12 hours 
on weekends.
There are some things, like 
the ventilation in the weight 
room, and the racquetball court 
size which cannot be changed 
due to funding or feasability. 
These things will change when 
the new center is built.

Cycling Club continues strong season
By DAVE MARTIN

The Carnegie Mellon Univer

Penn State-Behrend campus on 
Saturday. Only a few racers 
dared to take on the elements as 
cold air and mist pervaded the 
skies. However, the five riders 
who did brave the less-than-desirable racing conditions made 
it worth their while.
In the womens race, sopho
more Amy Thomson was CMUs 
sole competitor and finished 
fifth, continuing a strong first 
racing season.
In the mens C category, freshmanMattPatton finished eighth 
and was determined the C se
ries leader. He will be wearing 
the leaders jersey at the race 
next week.
Freshman Eric Lobeck raced 
in the B category for the first 
time. Behrend was his third ca
reer road race. Lobeck looked to 
take the race, but in the last lap, 
he met with bad fortune.
Somebody hit my handlebars 
and I went flying, Lobeck said. 
I landed on my head and skid

The ladders. These are the only objects, they are single without exception and vary greatly in size. . . . These ladders are greatly in demand. At the foot of each at all times or nearly a little queue of climbers. And yet it takes courage to climb.to climb. For half the rungs are missing and this without regard to harmony.... ... the need to climb is too widespread. To feel it no longer is a rare deliverance... The purpose of the ladders is to covey the searchers to the niches. Those whom these entice no longer climb simply to get clear of the ground. 
Samuel Beckett, The Lost Ones
At the foot of the ladder, we wait. The line shuffles ahead and slowly one by one the 
crowd ascends. What awaits us at the top? No one calls down to tell us. Even if one tries it 
would not really be heard.The task is quite simple, climb and experience the next phase. Up 
out of this kiva I will climb. With fear and a certain boldness a step is taken and up and up.
How do I sum 6m years at CMU? only with thanks for the support and education that 
my friends have offered me in my work and life. The Dossier has been a great opportunity 
for me to help organize creative and talented students to show their work while learning the 
true meaning of deadline.
- Hans Wang 
Design Editor

---------------------------------------------------

And now presenting the Dossier Senior Issue, filled to capacity with work 
from the senior Creative Writing majors. Traditionally, this sixth and last 
issue has been considerably larger than the five preceding it, but Hans 
and I had no idea it would be this big. It's really pretty hefty, I know it; 
but there's some interesting stuff inside, so stop snickering.
You may guess that we editors have had the themes of transition and 
ladders on our minds (thanks to Hans). This is a scary time for all se
niors; not just those involved in the arts. But sometimes young people 
interested in art are advised to live in the rough, to pick out the real 
stuff of life; to suck in all the conversations and images and ideas 
around them, then spit them out again, newly interpreted. But I wonder 
what would happen if we used art as only a basis, and that through creat
ing, we could, perhaps, come closer to helping ourselves and others keep 
on with the living; maybe live even better. I dont know. There are lots 
of theories...
Next years literary editor will be Michael Gabriel. Hes got plenty a 
kindlin in his fire, so watch out.
Id like to say thank you to all those who submitted work this year, and 
encourage them in their writing. Simply the act of submitting to a publi
cation says something positive about a writer, I think. Also, Id like to 
thank that helpful and most nocturnal Tartan Staff. And now, a round of 
thanks for all the people who contributed writings or design to 1991-1992 
Dossier.

the port. Since she hoards so many containers, someone 
else inevitably ends up short. Now I understand that 
Giuseppina is arguing with the other villager, not with the 
man holding the clipboard. The latter is only interjecting 
comments into the dispute.
Someone is tugging on my sleeve. It is Zio 
Mario, a retired fanner who is ninety-five and a whiz at 
cards. I have watched him playing at the bar with the 
other older men during the slow hours after lunch. He 
cannot speak very well, only in gestures. So, now he 
gestures to me and then beyond the bombola truck away 
from the main landing dock. Another truck is approach
ing. Like a man negotiating his pot belly through a 
doorway, this truck, a garbage truck, sways tipsily and 
top heavy on the narrow road. Only the walls of houses 
on either side will prevent it from toppling.
The trucks motor rumbles more audibly over now 
the bombola dispute. But the truck does not slow down as 
it gets closer and for a second I think it will not stop. The 
dust the trucks wheels kick up from the street tickles my 
nose and stings my eyes which begin to water. My vision 
blurs. Then, only two yards from the front of the 
bombola truck, the garbage truck grunts to a stop.
Pietrino and Giuseppina are still haggling; they have not 
even glanced once in the direction of the garbage truck. 
Others have noticed however, and a few shout Ay! 
when the truck stops.
From the cab of the garbage truck, a man named 
Massimo climbs down and slams the door. He is a large 
man who walks with his feet splayed and his stomach out. 
He is also the only red head among the native population 
of the island and his face at this moment displays the 
untamable temper of a true red head: cheeks flushed and 
his lips tightly pursed. He starts to shout and his boom
ing voice makes even the dogs freeze in their tracks. 
However, the three bombola hagglers ignore Massimo.
M. translates for me. Massimo is angry because the 
garbage truck has to be on the next ferry which is due to 
dock in five minutes. Massimo is a farmer, the islands 
notary public, and the garbage collector for all three of 
the islands that form a half-circle around the western tip 
of Sicily.
Massimo waves his arms and strides over to the 
man with the clipboard. This one lifts his cap off, not in a 
gesture of greeting but to air his head. I am soaked with 
sweat myself. Even in the shade it is too hot to move. 
Massimos voice grows even louder and his gestures 
larger. The man with the clipboard still ignores him. He 
writes something down and speaks to the young man who 
climbs up on the truck to pull down another bombola.
Zio Mario tugs at my sleeve again. This time he 
makes the gesture for cuckold, his hand in a fist except 
for the thumb and pinkie. Then he points at Massimo. I 
laugh and Zio Marios eyes twinkle. The dogs and 
children begin to run about again.
Pietrino quits his argument with the bottega owner 
and starts to yell back at Massimo, backing him toward 
the garbage truck. He is shaking his finger at Massimo 
and then turning and shaking it at the bombola truck. 
Other people are shouting and gesturing. It looks like 
Giuseppina is taking advantage of the situation to get all 
the containers she wants; the clipboard man scribbles 
away and bombolas collect around him.
Massimo stops shouting. He hitches his pants 
higher on his hips and climbs back into the cab of the 
garbage truck. The engine starts. People are still shout
ing at him. Dust swirls around everybody. Pietrino has 
followed Massimo to the front of his truck, waving his 
finger even more ferociously. Suddenly little Marco 
runs out from the crowd towards the truck. The wheels 
of the truck roll slightly backwards. The clutch catches. 
There is a flash as the sun reflects off the cabs side 
mirror. Little Marco runs in front of the wheels. I freeze. 
This all happens in a split second. It appears that no one 
is watching him but me.
Another flash, not a flash of light this time, but 
one of movement. An arm reaches out from the shadow 
of the wall and grabs little Marco out of the way of the 
trucks wheels.
The truck backs out the way it came and Pietrino 
turns back to Giuseppina. He sees all the bombolas she 
has collected and spreads his arms out as if to embrace 
the crowd. Va bene! he says, exasperated.
I lean out of the shade to see little Marco giggling 
with Pippo, a boy of sixteen, who tickles him. The air 
rises in waves of relief from the heated street.

I never thought the sky could hold so many stars.
The comfort of the beaten wooden planks under my feet grounds me here, above the bay as if 1 were actually walking on its glass smoothness.1 push on one of the loose pilings of this dock and the phosphorus below begins to speak. How long before the sky and the sea are drowned by the grey light slowly bleeding across the bay'.1
The townies used to ride an old bicycle off the edge of the Yacht Club dock.A rope was lied to the seat so the bicycle could be hauled hack up from the water and with cheers and hollers be ridden off the edge again.Until one day the banana bicycle seat was all that pulled up from the bay.
The townies haled the summer people for treating their town like a collection of life-sized doll houses.The summer people hated the townies because it was fashionable.I was caught somewhere in between, a lonely visitor who look the time to scrtatch the surface of peeling paint.
Nick's mother warned me of the swan but all I saw a beautiful bird and when 1 got to close to its young, it reared back in a hiss and damped down on my hand. As she bandaged my linger, Nick's mom said, "Everything pretty ain't to be touched." When she asked where my mother was, I pointed out the kitchen window to a white and red spinnaker on the hay.Nick's mom snapped her gum.
1 spent that day, and the rest of the summer with Nick.I learned that the sterile smell of his mother's hands was residue from disinfectant and lloor polish from a local school,I learned that, at low tide, bubbles would escape from the sand; that clams and mussels might be underneath.1 met a friend who could freely talk of his father's death.I heard of an old bicycle under the bay on its side, slowly collecting barnacles.
We went down to the Yacht club, Nick and I and Nick's friends - my friends - and I dove for the water.In the air, I could see it all, my mother on the sailboat, steering the nidder. letting out the sail, acting as if hers was a rough life. 1 saw all the summer kids on their Hobie Cats and water skis determined to leave behind a slinging wake for those who were beneath them; acting above a life they would never understand.I saw Nick's mom snap her gum as she scrubbed the cafeteria lloor. I saw Nick's father's heart fail.I saw him fall to the ground.1 saw the swan as every vain promise I look as gold.And I fell my foolish dreams crash as I broke the water.
I opened my eyes for the first lime in that dirty bay.and I pumped the water behind me until I could touch boltom.And I saw the seatless, powder blue bicycle, and I kicked, and 1 reached

Louis Faassen 
Wayne, Who is a Living Poem
This morning Im reading about a particular tragedy in the newspaper, and probably 
because the expression on my face keeps changing, my wife comes over to look at what Im 
reading. She is conscious of me getting through this article so she doesnt say anything, 
and I am just glad she doesnt. I know how she is standing behind me and I dont want her 
to touch me or to ask me to explain. I only want some coffee.
A kid I knew in fourth grade is in this article, without a photo so that I wonder what he 
must look like in gray newspaper dots, now that he is not a kid. Even in fourth grade, he 
was tall and thick in an almost obscene way, and hed just moved in up the street from the 
house Id lived in all my life. The first time I saw him he was wandering around the street 
with a sheet of aluminum foil pressed over his face and head. He was feeling his way 
around, without any eye holes, just a ragged tear for a mouth, groping for trees with a 
certainty that he would find them and swinging around stop signs with the sun glinting off 
the silvery wrinkles. I dangled from the lowest branch of a sycamore near my house, 
watching, and finally abandoned the branches before he was in arms reach, even before he 
got close enough to hear me running off.

---------------------------------------------------

Before the kids in school were afraid of him, they made fun of him. They called him 
Wayne the Pain the Doo-Doo Stain, Came from Spain on a Smelly Train. His name was 
more than a name; it was like a poem or a story that was always with him, so that you didnt 
have to ask questions about him. Only I didn't say his name that way. I wondered about 
him from the beginning, from that first day when hed been stumbling around my street 
without a real face on. One day at school, after someone had thought up his name, Wayne 
the Pain looked across the aisle of desks and started talking to me. He spoke as if at any 
moment he might not get to say another word the rest of his life, and I just nodded, not 
hearing any of it. He spoke without pretending to whisper, radiating to me that intense heat 
of conspicuousness. I felt it in my face and in my hands. Mrs. Stinton was trying to teach 
long division, then trying to get Wayne the Pain to shut up and Wayne the Pain just kept 
talking. She came near both of us, and where she used to seem so terrible, looming over me 
like that, with her artificially blue-black hair, at that moment I couldnt even look at her 
because of how Wayne talked at me. He talked like she wasnt even there, as if he had 
nothing to lose.
1 wish now that 1 could remember what he said. It was the reason Wayne was sent 
outside with an armload of chalkboard erasers to pound out on the sidewalk. Eraser 
pounding was standard procedure for speaking offenses, but since Mrs. Stinton hadnt said 
where Wayne had to serve his punishment, he walked around the school until he was right 
below the windows outside the classroom. A few minutes into remainders, theres a 
whack from outside the window. On that clear September day, every window in the 
classroom was.open and Mrs. Stinton maybe saw what was going to happen. She wrote 
reminder, with effort on the blackboard, and 1 concentrated on the mistake, not laughing. 
She couldnt erase it if she wanted to-shed sent every eraser out with Wayne.
No one could see him, but it was impossible not to hear him:
whack. (Pause) Whack. (Pause) Whack Whack Whack. WHACK.
None of us listened to the woman at the blackboard. There was only the force of felt 
erasers against the side of the school. And maybe someone was looking around to the 
windows at the back of the room, and saw little puffs of chalk dust rising out by the 
windows. 1 didnt look, but I could almost smell that powdery dryness, almost making me 
gag. I also thought that after school maybe wed be getting on the bus and see bathroom 
words spelled out on the bricks, pounded in dull chalk-yellow, but I kept looking straight 
ahead.
Whack Whack. WHACK WHACK WHACK WHACK. Wayne the Pain beat the 
hell out of the erasers like theyd give something up to him, and inside, kids were realizing 
that for Wayne, people like Mrs. Stinton didnt matter, and probably people like us who had 
names for Wayne didnt matter either.
Reading this article in the paper in my kitchen, where my life is cut and dried, I think 
about being in a bar between home and my bank job. It was not long ago, in this same 
town I grew up in. I sat at the bar, wondering what the woman I married was cooking for 
me for dinner, the same woman who at this moment reads the paper behind me, but who 
doesnt know Wayne because Wayne and I are both much older than her. Wayne the Pain, 
who had gone away for years, was suddenly there at the bar. I know he didnt recognize 
me, but he sat next to me, anyhow, away from the neon beer signs. I was struck as Id been 
in fourth grade with his certainty, his conviction. I had forgotten the smell of his warm 
sweat. I had forgotten the way he looked at me without turning his head. The bar was a 
murky place. Features were indistinct. Unmistakably, though, here was Wayne the Pain the 
Doo-Doo Stain.
All I saw were his arms, big, his hair and his eyes, evenly dark, and I said to myself 
that I wouldnt forget what he said this time. I wouldnt be like a small animal that cant 
move. And when he finally spoke, all he said was that somewhere hed been taught how to 
write. He sipped his beer and looked at me in this familiar dark, hardly blinking, and said, 
Ive learned how to write. And Im going to write a poem someday. Im going to write 
how my girlfriend has eyes like erasers that keep erasing me away.
In our kitchen, my wife fills my coffee cup without speaking. Before she can stand 
behind me again, 1 fold the newspaper on this tragedy, reminded that Wayne was, if nothing 
else, a man of his word. Sometimes you only know one thing about a person and with 
Wayne I know what becomes of erasers. I drink my coffee feeling I know the sort of thing 
that juries and newspapers will never know. It is the sort of thing you dont even want to 
try to explain to your wife, that you are somehow privileged to have ever seen, and which 
you dont like to think about, because it only makes you wonder about yourself.

Paige Manulkin Malerman 
Martyrology Service, 1982
They want the black armbands,
the yellow stars to burn
into our flesh. We feel the itch
of the chapels cushioned
scats, express thankfulness
to the stained glass, the wooden
ark, the eternal light that we have escaped
Hebrew class, even for a martyrology
service, even to be ordered to burn
memory into our arms
of our ancestors, great aunts, uncles
grandparents. One of us, eyes darkly
lit and dancing, silently flourishes a black
pen, moves it like a wand right, now left,
always hidden from the tcachers'searching eyes.
lie waits, and when Rabbi turns away,
scratches numbers on his arm. We all dance
away from this hour, not a refusal
to remember but a desire not
to have this identity forced upon us.
We know genocide resides somewhere
no matter what or how we remember.
It happens when we feci forced
into a design someone else drew for us,
even when the motif is our own heritage. We hold
a waterfight after services, behind the high
hedged synagogue garden where stark
signs tell us we must not trespass.
We notice the bands bleeding 
onto our clothes, leaving black marks 
our mothers cannot remove, emblems 
for which they remonstrate us, 
but we resist and refuse shame.
The service has taught us that much
at least. Five years later those 
of us who are still left
to attend martyrology will stand togetherstill outside that gardenburning holes 
in our skin with cigarettes, trying 
through the odor of burnt flesh 
to reconstruct the meanings 
we had been taught bonded us together.

Lorraine Miller(Excerpt From) Like Other Women Do
She said, "Roby, do it to me without it, please. Leave that thing in your wallet." The next month there is no period, and Abby knows she is going to have a baby. She is sixteen and lives with her father, Harold, whom she docs not tell about the baby. She could have told Cynthia, but her stepmother walked out on Abby and Harold last year. Abby's real mother left them when Abby was a baby.Abby isn't afraid to tell her father she is pregnant, but she knows how delicate he is--how his face reddens over some TV commercials, how his words stumble and tangle when he must tell Abby that her bikini is too tight, that she's stayed out too late, that Cynthia is gone for good. Abby sees how he acts like he wishes he was somewhere else when he is uncomfortable or embarrassed.Abby does tell Roby."Baby, I'm gonna have a baby," she whispers as he is slipping on a condom. He lets it fall and goes ahead without it."How do you know?" he says afterwards. He is hanging his head out the window and lighting the half-smoked cigarette he snuffed when he started to undress Abby."Roby, 1 know. We didn't use a condom once, and now I'm pregnant."She waits for Roby to say something. She pushes her damp and matted hair out of her eyes. Her mouth tastes dusty and plastic like the green vinyl car seat, so she reaches over to have a drag from Roby's cigarette. She finishes the cigarette while he starts the car. He lets it idle for a moment while he arches his back and pulls on his jeans. Abby is hesitant to speak. She wants to discuss this with Robyhe is twenty and and will know what to do. But until she knows how Roby feels about a baby, she has nothing to say. A few miles down the road, she decides to take his silence as a clue."I don't want a baby," she says."Me neither," says Roby. He reaches out one hand and ruffles her hair, poking her in the ear because he must keep his eyes on the road and cannot look at what he's doing to Abby.
At home in the evening after Roby has dropped her off, Abby sits alone on the porch swing that her father built, he said, for rocking her to sleep when she was a baby. This was before Cynthia, when it was just Abby and her dad. Like things are now.Harold has gone to the moviesthat is what the note under the flower vase on the kitchen table says. Abby doesn't need a note. For five years, Harold and Cynthia went to the movies every Friday night. Now Harold goes alone. Abby would never go to the movies by herself. She is embarrassed by the thought of her dad alone. She imagines how he parks his car in town and walks down the block past the dry cleaner, the jewelry repair shop, the Chinese fast-food place, around the corner and right up the ramp into the big front lobby. He buys his ticket', the only "One, please," in a line of couples and groups of school kids. He watches a film about a man and a woman who have left the city to escape the pressures of a fast life but now each find the smallness of country life stifling. They end up going back to the city after they realize they feel the samc-but only after they've both become miserable. Communication: this is the theme. After the movie has ended, down to the last credit, Abby imagines how her father stands up and blinks his way back into the light of the lobby. On the way back to the car he walks with his hands in his pockets, and he is smiling over the movie, which was sort of a comedy.Abby is feeling sorry for her dad, but hoping that none of her friends has seen him, when the anger washes over her. She'd been swinging high, but suddenly she skids the soles of her sneakers against the cement floor of the porch and brings the swing to a halt. The chains rattle and jangle for a moment, then arc still.For God's sake, Abby is thinking, he's my liati.And something is telling her, instinctively, that shame and pity are not things she should feel toward a parent. She is ashamed of herself for her lack of compassion. She is angry at her father for not being strong. She can't forgive him for not giving her a mothernot a real mother, not any mother. She can't forgive him for the way he is, for his unaggressiveness and unwillingness to face anything unpleasant or embarrassing. She realizes this is the reason for Cynthia's leaving; there had been huge fights over things like Harold's reluctance to ask the paper boy to correct his aim so the morning paper didn't have to be fished out of the hedge or the birdbath. She remembers how Harold did or said little to defend himself when Cynthia fought with him.She wonders if this was also the reason for her real mother's leaving, but deep down inside Abby really believes that her mother left because she was young and beautiful and didn't want a husband and a little baby to look after. Abby also believes that Harold is the way he is because he has never gotten over losing Abby's mother, whom he loved more than anyone.

Maryanne's Birthday
Kristina Mayes
A sister remains forever a stranger 
to me. The February wind scatters 
snow dust across her stone and deposits 
white glitter in the carved letters,
Alone with frozen bones, I imagine 
a different childhood, of trading 
secrets or angry words with a friend 
who shared my clothes, my breakfast
cereal, my sins. Curiosity still 
fills the place where mourning belongs 
even as I lay a Birthday rose upon 
this wintery blanket, a splash of red 
to mar her ivory breast,

constructed; a real piece of American craftsmanship, where every 
plank and nail serves its purpose. The house needs painting, 
However: the old coat has begun to crack and peel. The place is

items in the room are a full length mirror and several bookcases 
with glass doors, filled with old, worn and dogeared books appar
ently read over and over. Several of them are strewn throughout, 
some still left open. A man enters. His name is George Callahan. 
He is a tall, well built man in his 50s wearing a white suit cut from 
a fine cloth. It is an old suit, however, slightly worn, threadbare 
and shiny. He wears a watchchain in his vest, his only jeweliy. He
walks by the mirror, is caught by his reflection, and stops to

before. He tries to straighten himself out, and somehow looks
more mussed than he did befoe. George continues his efforts, but 
only gets increasingly irritated. The comedy of this situation is. i------j uncomfortable sense of his real desperation. He

seconds, though, tosses it back on the table, slighdy annoyed, and 
starts to rub'his, temples with two fingers. Then he notices the 
scotch botde on axabinet across the room. In a few seconds, he 
crosses the room to pour himself a generous shot, and starts to sip 
it deliberately.

WANDA
{voice offscreen, calling upstairs) George! Chick! Come down, please, Im almost finished breakfast!
George finishes his drink quickly, causing him to cough. He recaps the
bottle and starts to walkaway
from cabinet, still coughing.
Suddenly he is seized with a
violent fit of coughing and has to
lean on the chair to compose
himself. Wanda, his wife, enters.
Still attractive in her 40s, she has a
solid build and wears a plain and
proper dress. She speaks with a
very slight German accent.
WANDA
(still calling upstairs) George!
Chick! Can you hear me? (sees 
George) George? Honey, youre
up so early. (George starts to reply,
but is cut offby a newfit of coughing. Wanda crosses the room to him andputs
her hand on his back.) Are you well? Can I get you something?
GEORGE
(turning away from her, irritated) Im fine! Fine! Jesus, womdn, you gave 
me a start! Whatre you doing up so early, anyway?WANDA
(sharply) I? I am doing what I always do. I am cooking you and our daughter breakfast. I am straightening up this house which the two of you seem determined to tear to the ground. I am keeping this home in order while you go off for days and weeks and months at a time, looking for work. Do you think this place keeps itself while you drink and talk with your friends at the club? Thats what Im doing up so early.
GEORGE
All right Wanda, Im sorry - you know that. Its just that you gave me a 
dreadful start...WANDA...and Ill thank you not to abuse the Lords name in this house.
GEORGE
What? Oh...sure, right.WANDANo, not sure,right. That child of ours is getting an awful mouth(suddenly turns to call up the stairs again) Chick! Can you hear me? Come down please! (turns back to George) -and she sure isnt learning it from me! 
GEORGE
(smiling) Oh, shes a smartass, all right. Id hate to be on the receiving end 
of that tongue of hers. Its enoughto make me pity that dimwitted beaux 
of hers.WANDALowell? Why that boy is too sweetnatured to offend anything.
GEORGE
Aye, a sure sign of his being dimwitted! Dyi you ever hear of an ox that 
could offend anyone? No, the sweetest tempered animal on earth it is, and
not enough brains to fill a teacup! (walks over to mirror and starts trying
to smooth the wrinkles out of his suit again. Wanda starts to straighten up
room: wiping dust, fiddling withfurniture, etc.)
WANDAHes a hard working boy... 
GEORGE
(bitterly, smoothing suit harder, 
flusteredly) Aint nobody working 
too hard these days.WANDAHes working hard enough to support his mother! And her parents! And his brothers and sisters! Thats working pretty hard, Id say. Of course, theyre not rich or anything...
GEORGE
Aye, thats for certain.WANDA...but i.ts still not easy to do what hes done. Not after he lost his father, anyway.
GEORGE
(turning away from mirror in disgust) Lost! You make it sound like he 
slipped down the damn sewer one day and was never heard from again! WANDA
(turning to him, sadly) Oh, George.
GEORGE
He killed himself, the bastard! Hung himself from the rafters of that 
same barn I helped him build some twenty years ago. What sort of way 
is that for a husband to act? Or a father?WANDAWill you calm yourself? I dont see why you hold Lowells fathers sins against him.
GEORGE
(touches Wandas arms, suddenly calm and serious) Listen Wanda, Ive 
always liked that boy, dimwitted though he be, and always held a soft 
spot in my heart for he and his family. But Im telling you these things 
run in the blood, and I dont like Chick gettin intimate with a man 
wholl off himself as soon as things get tough!WANDA
(resigned,, a little sad, yet annoyed) Alright, George. I really ought to go 
finish cooking breakfast, (starts to turn) Wait, let me fix your tie. (She
adjusts his tie, then starts to smooth out his suit gently) Im sorry, I really 
ought to get around to mending this suit for you, its getting so thin and worn. There, I suppose thats fine for now. How about a kiss for services redendered?
GEORGE
What? Why itll be a pleasure.
They kiss a few moments, then Wanda pulls away a little suddenly. Her tone
is quietly sarcastic.
WANDA
A little early in the day isnt it?

work in progress
Tamara Liebert
In one of my dreams the 
other night, I was standing 
with a group of people in 
the middle of some waisthigh ocean, and there was a 
storm moving in across the 
sky over our heads. The 
clouds were like slate-gray 
pillows, popcorn-puffy, and 
hung low in the sky. At 
some point, I noticed they 
were actually descending, 
and then disappearing 
underwater! Soon after 
that, I began feeling for 
clouds bumping into my 
shins, and it was a really 
good time.
This morning I woke up in my bed and I was very 
pleased with the room for being there, even though all 
kinds of things arc in store for me today, you needn't 
remind me. God knows I've never been ready for 
anything that's come to me; it's been surprise after 
surprise, but I've learned something about surprises 
in these many years: they're the only things you can 
really trust to be waiting up the road or around the 
corner, moving through your life with a ferocious 
uneven regularity, if you can say that. Of course, if 
Marty were here, he'd say come on, ma, you can't 
put those words together, they don't fit. That's all right 
though. I know all about that and about the rules, 
which is what makes me so free in the first place.
Of course, I had my shower and my yoga and then 
there was the coffee to heat as usual and my pear and 
two slices of toasted rye with sour cream. I turned on 
the big brown radio as I ate my breakfast and listened to 
that music program I like for an hour or two  just 
sat at the table in my yellow kitchen by the radio with 
the breeze coming through the window every now and 
then, and it was very nice. Out of everything, that's 
the hardest thing to get you children to understand, 
bccausc as you see it, it needs no explanation. But 
underneath the beautiful music flowing out of my 
radio is something of the radio itself. I can't put my 
finger on it exactly, cxcept that, having sat for so many 
years beside it, that silly old radio has begun to grow 
a little like me. Were two of a kind. I'm laughing 
out loud now. Isn't that silly?
One day in 1927,1 was in my father's store packing 
up some potatoes for Mr. and Mrs. Shatsky when a 
young man opened the door and slunk into the place 
with a funny look on his face, something between 
anger and horrible frustration. I'd never seen him 
before and he made me feel quite giddy, but of course 
I had my customers. So I finished my wrapping and said 
goodbye Mrs. Shatsky goodbye Mr. Shatsky veiy 
loudly in a nasally voice that commanded attention 
and immediately I felt like the silly girl my mother 
used to tell me I was. But it didn't matter, all that, 
because this young man wasn't paying a wit of 
attention to me  oh no -- he was as devoted to the 
tomato pyramid to the left of my counter as if his 
life depended on it. He was talking to himself and 
fumbling in the pockets of his coat and 1 felt as 
though I wanted to help him in some way. When I 
finally said in my best voice, the special throaty voice 
I saved up for special occasions, can I help you with 
the tomatoes sir he turned and looked at me at last 
and I saw plain as can be that he didn't know whether 
to say yes, yes I need some help with these tomatoes or 
no, I've got the tomatoes under control, thank you miss.
In fact, he just settled for a look that said he had no idea
what I was talking about, tomatoes. So, I shrank back 
behind the counter and watched him until he 
eventually left, not buying a thing.
But the next day, five minutes before Daddy 
put up the closed sign, which I had painted 
myself, the young man came back into the 
store, marched straight past Daddy and up to me, 
while I was swinging my legs from the top of 
the counter. I jumped down and kept looking 
from Daddy to the man, until he blurted out could 
he call on me at some point in the near future, 
which I agreed to, and which he did presendy.
Daddy let us go, though in those days it wasn't 
very common, and I believe we went for an egg 
creme at the drug store on the comer. In two weeks 
we were engaged to be married, and that's how 
I met Hart  grandpa  all those years ago, if 
you'll believe that story.
I was so green then! I hadn't a care in the world, 
except have the peaches come in bruised on Mr. 
Herschel's truck or not, or shoot did Mama put 
celery in my tuna fish again. But the day Hart 
came into the store, I knew, I knew it was all 
going to change. All the years before, I thought 
there was something missing from my life so 
important that I might die. Oh, I loved my 
family; Daddy with his wonderful laugh and our 
outings to the park; Mama who cooked me 
salmon burgers in a skillet as many times a week 
as I wished; Gussie who braided my hair and 
tickled my feet. But I was 18; almost an old 
maid. And the worst part was that I was 
embarrassed for my English. We'd come over 
on the boat only ten or so years before and I was 
never like the American girls, all fresh in their 
crisp linens and wonderful hats. So many hats! 
And I was green, too, on top of not having any 
hats or pretty linen clothes, though of course you 
recently pointed out to me that all men are not so 
interested in such things. But I loved clothes; I 
sewed my own to get them the way I wanted, and 
they were just as pretty. The hats were more 
difficult, so I treated my hair right instead. Such 
shiny hair! Long and wavy chestnut, part-in-themiddle; no fuss. A pretty girl.
I always wanted to learn from books. I loved 
poetry and songs and I liked making up silly word 
riddles to tell to Aunt Gussie when she was still 
little enough to play with. I liked thinking all 
right, but Hart Ostrov was something else. Can 
you understand what I'm getting at? I'm not sure 
after all these years just how much I'm twisting 
the facts of my life. They feel real to me, but 
maybe that's the most frightening part of all...

Holding My Son
Julie Albright
Lynn and I chose the name for this baby months ago. Austin. We did it together; we both always liked that name. Together we redid my study into a baby room and went to Lamaze class, and I drove her to baby showers, thinking the whole time that she looked like an eighteen wheeler cab without the eighteen wheels. Like the ones you see on the street, just a rounded cab in the front with nothing to balance it out in the backshe protruded so much in the front that I thought she might topple over. I didnt say this, but Lynn knew she looked funny, so sometimes we laughed about it and sometimes shed tell me to put a sock in it. The whole time was like that; we never knew when shed feel well or sick or grouchy, but we were together every day, all the time.The two of us went in for one of the final checkups the other day, because Austin was supposed to be bom in just two weeks. But when the doctor went to check the heartbeat, he couldnt find it. In that moment I thought of myself. Like Lynn didnt even exist, I started thinking that I couldnt breathe, that no one would ever help me to be able to breathe again, that I was the only one left in the room.Throughout all the next tests, I didnt say a word. Neither did Lynn. Together we sat in the waiting room and listened to the doctor tell us that the baby was dead and that Lynn would still have to deliver it. She started to cry, and I started to cry with her. We had spent so much time waiting for Austin, so I couldnt really believe that he wasnt coming, but I held onto Lynns hands and we put our heads together and cried.
She went into spontaneous labor two days later. I stood beside her while she remembered all the techniques we had learned, and I watched the baby come out with a sea of grey fluid. We got to hold it in our arms a little while later, and the nurse took pictures for us. Then they took Austin away to find out why he didnt come out alive. We went home with a box of the things that live babies come with: a lock of his hair, his footprints. Also a death certificate.And then we were home, with nothing. Nothing except a whole house full of baby shower presents and a baby room waiting in anticipation. Ive been thinking that I would like to get a nice wooden box in which I can save a few things of Austins. Otherwise, well have to pack up all these things and put them away, I dont know where. I cant think about it for too long yet. When I first saw his crib, I got a kind of underwater feeling, like I could never come up, and when I told Lynn about this, and about maybe getting a box for the things, she walked away from me. In the week weve been home from the hospital, shes been walking away from me very often, and I dont follow her.She still looks strange, Lynn doesa little puffy and very pale, and she still walks like she is carrying a weight. When I look at her swollen feet pinched into her shoes, I cant help but think of those soft dolls who come with slip-on shoes that dont ever fit right. Thats what my wife looks like, white and limp and not fitting into even her softest slippers.Its funny, because I dont know much about dolls or toys at all. I thought I would

---------------------------------------------------

come to know these kind of things. This morning I was looking at Lynn, and I realized that I dont know anything of what she has felt for the past days. We had done the whole thing together, Lynn and I, until for two days she carried a dead baby inside of her. I dont know why I didnt think of that sooner. I havent asked her about it yet, because she is still spending most of these days in bed in a little ball. But I needed to know what it was like, because theres not much else I get to know about Austin.So today I walked around the house with a whole chicken under my shirt. It was the closest thing I could think of to the baby. It was white and heavy and dead, and if I had removed the plastic wrap, its skin would have flaked off in the same way as the babys. I didnt think I would need to hold it in my arms, because I got to do that with the real thing, and once was enough. I had thought that nothing could be worse than holding your dead child in your arms, but I suddenly I thought about my wife and realized that she had held it inside of her.I went to the Giant Eagle and bought a whole big chicken. A turkey was too big.The chicken was just about Austins size, and when I got home, it fit right under my sweatshirt. I put my hands on the lump it made and I stroked it.Feel this, I said to no one in particular. I tried to be calm, but my voice was already a little shaky. I thought of Lynn, in her tight shoes. I thought of her being tight and uncomfortable even when we did all those things togetherand me, balanced and unweighted, driving the car and taking part
in what I thought was all of the pregnancy.And then, Its not moving. Im a little worried, I said to the room full of shower gifts. I think I should be able to feel something, I said, feeling things around me start to speed up, as if compensating for the babys lack of motion. I couldnt stop then, my mind was hurling ahead and sideways and struggling to come up for air. I had to look at it, and I ripped the chicken out from under my shirt and I shook it until my hands were covered in bits of chicken skin. I held it up in the air and I saw that it wasnt breathing, that it was falling apart. I heard my own gasps, far away. I shook the chicken until my fingers hurt. Then I took the thing in my arms, which were ready to be a fathers arms, and I rocked it until it until dinner time.Its night now, and Lynn never even got out of bed to eat. Neither of us bothered to turn on the lights after sundown, so Im standing in the darkness of our bedroom doorway, straining to see her shallow-breathing shape. From here she looks so far away, and I cant think that I will ever really know what shes feeling.Maybe someday I will tell her that if you squint at one of those whole chickens long enough, maybe in a dark room, it really does look like an infant body. In the dimness, it fits right into the crook of your arm, feels like it belongs there. There is no head, no slick hair or slow-motion moving hands, but its heaviness and color remind me of a baby. Remind me of that tiny, motionless body, the eyes that never opened, my son.

yet. I still think he's a prick for saying that, but I understand. 
At least I've never called myself a poet. Even though I may 
write poetry on occasion, I'll still tell you that I hate poetry. I

Work in Progress
I ignore Timmy on the other side of the door. His tap-tap is like a soft whimper 
and his voice is like a steady scratching of the wood. I flush the toilet to drown him 
out and again and again when it stops running. I hear my name floating in and out 
of the drowning sounds, and then I start to hum "ooommhoom" deep, my song 
heightening as my husband starts to yell.
There is a time during every day, when a woman must have peace. For this 
woman, it is standing on the heated linoleum in the morning. Me standing at the 
mirror, eyes tight, lips chalky, my skin smelling like Miracle Whip. Downstairs is 
usually Timmy watching the rays of the Today show sun rise from the corner of the 
t.v. screen. This morning he is switching through the channels of my peace, slowly 
working my nerves. I am not a woman to snap quickly, but when I do snap, when 
Ive got the matter out of my eyes, some hot-hot water in my face, some talcum 
powder between my breasts, I swing the door open and let it crash against the hard 
plastic tile. "You," I say, "have got nothing to say. I'll shop when I wanna shop!"
"What the hell are you talking about? Have you heard a thing I've said out 
here?" His face is damp, like dew has settled in its creases.
"You sleep outside again last night? I say. The last time he disturbed my 
morning peace it was to ask whose vehicle was parked in our driveway and then to 
pull me by my pantyhpse to the window shouting, "You bitch, you bitch, how could 
you let these things come between us?" And he pointed down to my new red sports 
car as if I had tried to sneak my lover in the back door. "What you sayin, Timmy." I 
said, "I told you I was getting a new car. It's just a car. Not the love bug." He laughed 
then, like a man who's been fooled for the last time and said, "Go ahead, Cleo. Itll 
probably make better love to you than I can."
A woman doesn't need to wake up to this kind of silliness in the morning. But 
now, he looks like such hurt, that I am instantly embarrassed by the hum of the toilet 
running in the background. This dampness settled in his face is all smeared tears. He 
leans back against the bannister and takes a deep breath.
"Start from the beginning," I say, this face of his reminding me of the pain 
which has become like soap and water for us. Waking us up in the morning and 
washing us down before we go to bed at night. That same pain which makes it 
necessary for a little morning peace.

---------------------------------------------------

"What," I ask, "is doing you like this? You're scaring me."
"We need to take a trip down to Roaville. Take a trip down to see my family." 
He leans against the bannister with his thick arms crossed over his chest. "My sister 
Shim lost her son this morning. His heart just finally gave out on him."
And then I feel my lips falling open and my legs are not so strong on the 
linoleum. Silence falls when the toilet finally stops and Timmy moves toward the 
bedroom. 1 reach for him, but he moves quickly to my closet and pulls shopping bag 
after shopping bag from its darkness. I am breaking up like I've stepped into a coldcold frost.
"What do you mean?" I say, "Dead?" Not dead as in our dead. Not the same 
dead. Not a cold, limp, little body dead. Timmy is pulling clothes from the shopping 
bags. "See," he says, "You're already prepared. Look here." He holds up a navy blue 
suit. "Now what do 1 have to wear to a funeral?" he asks. I walk to him licking the 
salty wetness from my lips, but he throws the suit jacket at me and sits on the bed, 
holding his face in his hands. And I recall that the last body I held was my dead baby 
eight months before. I stand grasping my suit jacket like its got veins and bones and 
blood and something that keeps it pumping.

Dialogues With A City by Chris Coker
I.
I will put my hands over my eyes 
and it will come like a summer squall:
rain for fifteen minutes, 
how it kept me inside 
beside my brother and sister.
We watched the splashes, each drop dance 
like fat ballerinas pirouetting 
on the tops of cars, on the tarred curbs 
where black ants chowed on a lost Saltine,
on our red brick street, its rat hairs 
and waterbugs, mangy one-eyed cats and children, 
their parents too drunk, 
too delirious in the heat 
and stench piled in heaps around them 
to call their kids in from the rain;
everything danced everywhere.
I have only dreamed 
of living at the city limits 
where homes have lawns 
and a tree
that shades a window, cools the house in the day and in the night 
whispers secrets of childhood, of adulthood 
through the bedroom window
branches as springboards,
II.
and if I listen hard enough
perhaps press my ear against the pane, or reach my hand against 
the elephant ear leaves
I will hear what I have not heard 
what I cannot say.
I have only heard the cement blocks of the pavement groan 
beneath the ice just before they crack and rise against each other.
I have heard this and it was not whispered, was not wise,
was not what I wanted to hear
when I climbed the gray lamppost, green paint 
stuck to the sweaty insides of my thighs.
I sat on top to catch the bay breeze I thought would be full 
of fog horns and stories of the bay 
and the larger breath of the ocean just beyond.
But these breezes only gathered the familiar, the flat 
sounds of car horns and sirens 
the whines that set me spinning
% -w >
Whenever I try to articulate any philosophy of writing, I find myself 
constantly deliberating between my writing and Theory. Well,
Fuck Theory.
Recently, I find a return to the city in my poetry. A return not just 
of a theme, but a return to my history, to a specific realization; a 
return to myself. It is only here that I have found my most poi
gnant writing. The city is not just a setting. It dictates the form of 
my writing, the tone, the emotion and my philosophy: Writing is 
not about finding a good metaphor, finding the right line break. 
Writing is personal and political. It is about yourself and your 
history. Here is the base; the springboard for your imagination.
And like jumping off the springboard, you have to allow yourse 
the freedom and exhiliration of being in mid-air.
And though we marveled at this beauty, 
at this cleanliness
we hated it; 
wrung our hands, 
squinted our eyes, 
sang our little songs 
at these splashes,
for all their grace, their energy 
we were trapped inside 
away from the cool
of marble steps, the chipped paint of lampposts,
away from the thick, doggish air of the city 
that swallowed our voices 
no matter how loud we screamed
and fed us full with itself: the sirens and car horns, 
the black fumes of buses, concrete and steel, stagnant sewer 
water and electricity that made the lampposts pop 
at dusk like squashed waterbugs.
I will not remove my hands. I have not finished crying 
and am still hungry:

and once I climbed a seven foot slide in the park 
heard these confusions 
and before I could slide I came crashing 
down, my head cracked the pavement
so, even today my ears buzz, hum 
with the surprised yelps and screams of a cracking, assaulted pavement.
And only once I tried to climb a city tree
to hear it speak, sure it would speak louder than a tin drum
louder than its brothers in the park
because no one would listen, no one stopped
except to throw their trash or relieve themselves, 
except to carve 
'fuck' into its bark.
I climbed, pressed my hand against its leaves 
and heard nothing
heard silence that was as foreign as vegetable gardens and flower beds
something worse than words cut deep in bark with knives 
found beneath car wheels
behind trash cans in back yards full of colorful dog shit.
It was violence
gathered in blistered heaps on neighbors lips 
all our lips were blistered when 
we heard 
who heard 
who heard 
who heard
what happened in the corner house 
the knife, the wife, the lazy-eyed child who never cried 
and the husband who wore thick chains from his jeans to his wallet
these words were never whispered, never exchanged 
in dialogues with neighbors, with the cracked pavements, with the breeze 
above the lampposts, above the trees, with the ants black on white crackers
with our walls that could never fall.

Music Department head urges students to get rid of 'boxes in Last Lecture
By AMY POTTHAST
Tartan Features Editor
On Thursday, Marilyn Taft Thomas, the head of 
the Music Department, gave her Last Lecture. In 
her introduction, senior music major Nicole 
Brockmann described Thomas as the driving force 
behind the renaissance of the Music Department. 
Thomas followed with an impassioned speech, prov
ing Brockmann right.
Thomas explained that a lot of students at CMU 
work toward their degrees in order to get better 
jobs, prepare to make a lot of money, and buy a lot 
of stuff. She says that she asateachertriessohard 
to teach those students what she is supposed to 
teach them, but sometimes, in the urgency of the 
years and the structure of the class, leaves out the 
things that they really need to know.
At graduation, Thomas said she feels students 
leave Carnegie Mellon a highly focused bunch of 
specialists ... [sometimes] too concentrated, too 
focused. She went on to say that while focus is 
good, with students setting goals and working 
toward them, that any university that is worth its 
salt should seek to open doors, not to close them.
Thomas recounted a stoiy about a trip she took to 
the Statue of Liberty. As the boat she was on 
approached the Statue, Thomas said she was awe
struck, and took pictures of the Statue as she got 
closer and closerfocusing on the Statue through 
the lens of the camera. When the photographs were 
developed, however, they not only failed to capture 
the magnificence of the structure, but they also 
looked just like every other picture of the Statue of 
Liberty Thomas had ever seen. So the next time she 
visited the Statue, Thomas said she took the oppor
tunity to look at the faces around her. Similar 
expressions of awe and amazement were on these 
faces; the Statue was absolutely dwarfing to the 
people below.
Needless to say, the latter experience was the 
more moving. Likewise, in life, focus can some
times be carried to the extreme. Focus can be an 
excuse, she said. If we box ourselves in we can get 
into trouble, stop growing, and limit our develop
ment. She drew an analogy to a lump of clay. At 
first, clay fits in the box it comes in. But after it 
is molded, with its curved surfaces and jagged 
appendages, the clay no longer fits in that box, 
or any other.
She said that people are not meant to be in 
boxes either. When you box yourself in with a 
single goal, you lose sight of other things. Tho
mas uses her own life as an example. Consider
ing herself a pianist all her life, Thomas disre
garded her English teacher who told her she 
could be a writer, and she ignored her algebra 
teacher who encouraged her to major in math. 
She saw history, psychology, and science as 
pointless and pushed those aside as well, all for 
the sake of the piano.
But then, when she was established as a piano 
teacher, she was struck with osteoarthritis, and 
was unable to teach piano any longer. Since 
then, and on her way to the position she now 
holds in the Music Department, Thomas says 
everything she has done has been a direct result 
of what I consider a blocked path. And what has 
she done? Shes earned a PhD in composition, 
worked as a college professor, and has worked on 
computer music projects  using all of those 
subjects that she deemed worthless when she 
was in school.
In addition to breaking ourselves out of boxes, 
Thomas warns against placing other people in 
boxes, and says that no one else can put us in 
boxes without our permission. And the ones to 
watch are the ones you love....Loving relation
ships should open your world, not make it 
smaller....We tend to repeat in adult life the 
scripts we wer given as children.
To break out of the boxes we might have placed 
ourselves in, Thomas recommends we identify 
the boxes and then conquer the fears that form 
the walls of the boxes  either fear of change, of 
failure or of success. And just about anyone 
might have shoved him or herself into a box.
After all, it is so much easier to become a 
scientist, a mathematician, or a musician, than 
to be yourself.

Author to give Awards
Goodfellas screenwriter to read 
at Adamson Awards Friday night
By MARNI BLAKE
Tartan Staffwriter
Student writers will be 
awarded this Friday night at 
the Pauline Adamson Awards, 
where Nicholas Pileggi, author 
of Wise Guys and the screenplay 
for Goodfellas, will be the guest 
speaker. Pileggi, an accom
plished journalist and writer, 
will talk about the process of 
translating a novel or non-fiction work into a movie  a pro
cess with which he has been 
very successful.
Pileggi was an English litera
ture major in college, and for a 
while he assumed he would go 
on to teach after graduation, like 
most of his peers. But while he 
was still in college he began to 
work for the Associated Press as 
a copy boy. This was the job that 
turned his head; he became 
fascinated with journalism and 
sincerely enjoyed his job, even 
as a copy boy.
He began to get noticed by the 
reporters and editors, he said, 
when he started to write the 
news stories that the real re
porters were assigned to. He 
would take down all the infor
mation that was coming in for 
the reporters and write up the 
story. The professionals at the 
Associated Press realized that 
his work was as good as any of 
theirs, so he became an AP re
porter in 1956, directly after his 
graduation from Long Island 
University. He looks upon his 
copy boy job as his true college 
education. That is where he got 
his education, and he feels that
the Associated Press created a 
life for him.
Pileggi has branched out and 
moved on to bigger things since 
his days at the Associated Press, 
although he remains very active 
in the field of journalism. In 
1968 he switched to magazine 
writing and created New York 
magazine with Clay Felker. As 
one of the founding editors, he 
also worked with people such as 
Gloria Steinem. Today he still 
contributes to the New York 
magazine, along with other pub
lications such as the New York 
Times, Esquire and Life.
During all of this time as a 
reporter and magazine writer, 
Pileggi began to specialize and 
concentrate on the Mafia. Most 
of his writing focuses on orga
nized crime and political cor
ruption. He has now been cover
ing the Mafia for 35 years and 
has gained the confidence of 
many Mafia people. These 
people keep coming back to him 
because they trust him, says 
Pileggi.
He has kept accurately de
tailed notes and over the years 
has amassed a vast collection of 
anecdotes. These notes have be
come very useful in his writing. 
His articles on the crime bosses 
of the Mafia attracted wide at
tention and respect, and his 
novel Wise Guy s, which presents 
an unsentimental look at a typi
cal Mafia organization, has en
joyed international acclaim.
After the success of the novel 
Wise Guys, Pileggi moved on to 
writing screenplay. He worked 
with director Martin Scorsese to
adapt his novel to the screen. 
This was a highly successful 
endeavor which earned the film 
the British Bafta award for Best 
Screenplay (equivalent to the 
American Oscar).
Pileggi may have seemed to 
dive head-first into the field of 
journalism after graduation  
forgetting about plans to use his 
English literature degreebut 
in reality he believes that his 
degree has enabled him to be
come the successful writer that 
he is today.
Some reporters or writers sim
ply chum out information he 
says. That has nothing to do 
with writing; thats just typ
ing. The difference between the 
two is an awareness of lan
guage, he believes: to any 
writer, reading is the founda
tion for highly effective language 
usage.
Pileggis advice to young writ
ers is straightforward. I think 
one thing that will be helpful is 
to try to work and write as well 
as possible. No matter how tight 
the market is, editors and pub
lishers will still be looking for 
exceptional work.
Some of the most exceptional 
work produced by CMU students 
will be recognized during the 
Adamson Awards.
The award ceremony rewards 
excellence in student writing in 
the areas of fiction, poetry, non
fiction academic journals and 
magazine writing, and the new 
category of screenwriting. Itwill 
take place on May 1 at 8 pm in 
the Adamson Wing, with a re
ception to follow.
Theta XI, Big Brothers/Big Sisters, Role Models join in benefit gladiatorial contest

Vartan Staffwriter
On Saturday,
\pril 18, the 
orothers and 
friends of 
CMlPs Theta Xi 
raternity 
losted Theta Xi 
Gladiators, an 
athletic philan
thropy event in 
Carnegie Mel
tons Main Gym, 
for the benefit of 
participants in 
the Big Brothirs/Big Sisters 
ind Role Modls programs.
About forty 
ihildren, 
iqually repreenting the two 
programs, par

American 
Gladiators 
style competi
tion which included football 
dunk, target shoot, lacrosse 
shootout, foozball, gazorch (i.e., 
large slingshot), staff Fight
ing, 2-on-l basketball, and an 
obstacle course. Theta Xi Phi
lanthropy Co-chair Todd Riley 
said that although foozball is 
"something our house really gets 
into, the contestants favorite 
were staff fighting and
the obstacle course.
Staff fighting was really neat 
to watch, Riley said, Out there

t-shirt and most received a rib

ond, or third 
place. We 
didnt want to 
make it too 
competitive. 
We want-ed to 
concentrate on 
having fun, 
Riley said. Par
ents were in
vited to attend 
the program 
and also had a 
good time.

those kids were pretty brutal. 
They really got into it. The 
Theta Xi brothers were also en
thusiastic about the program.

He dressed up in this crazy long

ran smoothly for 
the first hour 
and a half, but after that the 
kids wanted to go to the events 
they liked.
The kids loved it, and ac
cording to Riley, Theta Xi plans 
to run the event again sometime 
in the future. I think this event 
is a good example of how the 
Greek student body can benefit 
the community and the campus. 
More events like this will soon 
follow.
Although Riley is the only Big 
Brother in the Theta Xi house, 
forty brothers  almost all of 
the brothers in Theta Xi who 
were in town over the Easter 
weekend  volunteered to par
ticipate, along with little sisters 
and other friends of the house. 
Although not a fund raising 
event, Gladiators was partially 
inspired by Basket Bucks, a 
philanthropy event run by the 
fraternity several years ago. 
Riley reported that the Univer
sity was very supportive of the 
event; Theta Xi was allowed the 
 use of the Main Gym Saturday 
afternoon by the basketball 
coaching staff and borrowed 
mats from the gym.
The house borrowed other 
equipment from some of its 
brothers. The fraternity also 
bought equipment and made 
some itself, including staffs for 
staff fighting and the gazorch 
for the gazorch event. Summing 
up his feelings about the event, 
Riley said, Id like to encourage 
everyone to get involved in pro
grams like Big Brothers/Big Sis
ters and Role Models. They are 
very rewarding and worth the 
while put into them.

Have you ever felt that people 
thought you were really, really 
stupid? Im not talking about 
the times when you went to a TA 
or professor and started the help 
session with, I am totally lost. 
That just shows that you are 
ignorant of the facts. At least 
you wish to take action to cor
rect it.
And Im not talking about the 
times when you fill out tax forms 
as easy as the 1040EZ or Penn
sylvania state tax forms. Deter
mining whether or not you are a 
resident is downright confusing. 
For example, I believe youre a 
resident of Penn, if you lived in 
Penn, for over 30 days in one 
place but had a domicile outside 
of Penn, which you didnt live in 
for over six months. But this 
; only holds true if you lived for 
those 30 days in one place. If 
youve moved, then it depends 
on where you moved. If you 
moved to the domicile, then 
youre only taxable for the time 
you spent in the Penn, domicile, 
i but you still dont know if you 
should be taxed as a resident or 
j non-resident for that time. This
scenario, of course, says nothing 
! about part-time residents. Con
fused? So am I, and I wrote this 
paragraph!
The quick reader has prob
ably caught on to what I am 
speaking about here. He or she 
is undoubtedly thinking of those
i incredibly moronic warnings and 
I directions that you see on com
mon, everyday items.
Being the safe and conscien
tious type of guy that I am, I 
recently bought a package of 
condoms. I was about to throw 
the box away, after I removed 
' . the condoms, when I noticed the 
directions on the inside. I didnt 
need to read them because, well, 
Ive read them before, and using 
a condom is like driving a car.
1 Once you learn how to use one,

Are you Moving or Spring Cleaning?
Yes? Well consider donating your household and apartment furnishings to the Office 
of Student Activities. We're looking for stuff that is in pretty good condition like dishes, , 
rugs, lamps, furniture you can carry to us, etc. 
You can bring your donations to the Office of Student Activities beginning Monday, 
May 4 until Friday, August 14, from 9 am - 5 pm, Monday - Friday.
In the Fall, we will sell the stuff, cheap, to other students at Carnegie Mellon's Great 
Garage Sale which will be held Friday, August 28,1 992 from 11 am - 8 pm in the tent 
on the Cut.

directions condescend to unwitting users
The Wizard of R.A.
by Christian Restifo
youve learned to use them all. 
This does not mean, however, 
that you automatically know 
how to use a condom once you 
get your license or vice versa.
Well, these directions had 
something new  pictures. Ap
parently, the producers of these 
items thought that I dont know 
what an erect penis looks like. 
In addition to that, they gave me 
advice that sounded more like 
motherly dictate. After the last 
direction that tells me to throw 
away a condom after using it, 
there were the words, And no 
more sexwithout anew condom.
When I read this, I instantly 
had this vision of my mom stand
ing at the foot of my bed shaking 
her hand while she held a 
condom in the other. In a con- cemed voice she uses when she 
tells me that my teeth will rot 
out if I dont brush them, she 
said, And no more sex, Chris
tian, without a new condom.
Now, I can understand telling 
people that they should only use 
a condom once and that you 
should use a new one each time. 
Some dont know this. However, 
using that language makes me 
feel like a teenager out with some 
girl in my dads station wagon. 
It also makes me feel stupid.
Other examples like this one 
abound. For example, go pick up 
a bottle of bleach. Youll see di
rections concerning what to do if 
it gets in your eyes or if you
ingest it. Youll also see warn
ings about keeping the item 
away from children. What gets 
me is the direction, Do not in
gest. How many people out 
there ingest bleach? I can just 
see my mom saying something 
like, You know, this punch 
doesnthave quite the right taste. 
I know! Well add bleach.
Look at lighter fluid directions. 
Do not allow contact with eyes. 
Thank goodness they put that 
warning on there. If they hadnt 
done so, people would have 
started using lighter fluid for 
cleaning contact lens. That 
wouldnt be as bad, however, as 
all those people using it for eye 
drops.
As one bboard poster recently 
noted, you can buy a container 
of sugar from a chemical com
pany, and youll receive warn
ings telling to you to wear gloves 
and a mask when you handle it. 
This is done for both safety rea
sons and to cover insurance sce
narios. Someone cant sue you 
for unknown dangers if they 
were negligent and didnt follow 
your directions.
I suppose manufacturers of 
household items do the same 
thing for the same reason. How
ever, I feel that maybe they could 
treat me with some respect by 
writing Not made for human 
consumption or contact with 
eyes on their products.
As for all those people who 
actually would contemplate eat
ing something, I have this piece 
of advice. If its food or drink, 
then its OK to eat or drink it. 
Otherwise, you might want to 
consult your doctor before in
gesting that bottle of Mr. Clean.
Christian Restifo is a junior 
chemical engineering major who

unlabeled containers in a chem
istry lab.

Dancers Symposium graces stage
By ORYADASNA
Tartan Assistant Diversion Editor
The alternative art space,The 
Turmoil Room, is a Wilkinsburg 
gallery with a casual air and a 
unique flavor. Presently show
ing at this art gallery is a collec
tion of work from the Carnegie 
Mellon class On Myth  Eter
nal Return, taught by visiting 
artist Rita Myers. The course is 
a loosely structured class that 
allows the students to explore 
different forms of art-making, 
in the context ofmythology, both 
ancient and contemporary.
The works shown were createdby the class students. Some 
outwardly explore myths and 
fairy tales but other pieces are 
more veiled and harder to deci
pher and see how they relate to 
myths. The works are tightly 
positioned in the small gallery 
space and all are forced to inter
act with the other works.
The gallerys two large dis
play windows are filled with 
works by senior Barbara Lee 
and junior David Jacobson. Lees  
work consists of various body 
casts made of plaster positioned 
before two large white body 
prints on a black backdrop. The 
prints are obviously made from 
a female body that while cov
ered in paintwas pressed against 
a canvas. The whole of the piece 
is overlaid with text.
Lees work represents the 
myth of the black female body.

Sophomore Jessica Miller's piece deals with the myth of the 
American dream.
DIVERSIONS
A man sits at the center of the stage perusing a photo album. A 
muse, arising from the behind his chair, begins to dance around 
him. He gradually realizes her existence. She puts a spell over him, 
but at the point when they are about to merge, she escapes him. The 
audience is left to wonder if his awareness is conscious, or if she is 
even a tangible being.
This sequence from Haunted When the Minutes Drag was the 
third act of Dancers Symposiums Disturbance in Torque. Cre
ated and performed by Cory Waletzko, Jim Cook, and D. Scott 
Woods to the song of the same name by Love and Rockets, the piece 
was a hybrid of daydream and fantasy. The coupling of their intense 
facial expressions and articulate movements casted a dream-like 
trance.
Haunted was, however, only one of the many strong aspects of 
Dancers Symposiums spring recital. Performed at the womens 
gym on three occasions this past weekend, the show was a stylistic 
potpourri, spanning from the abstract Zoo Blah Zoo Cafe to the pert 
Express Yourself (danced to its namesake song by Madonna). 
Choreographed and performed entirely by Carnegie Mellon stu
dents, the individual pieces ranged from the mediocre to the 
exceptional, although the final product was quite satisfying.
It was disappointing to see pieces with such immense promise, 
such as The Other Side of the World, choreographed and performed 
by Amy Blake and Terrel Dean, not reach full potential because of 
its music. Chaka Khans voice was sheer cacophony; the fluid 
movements of Blake and Dean seemed highly disjointed from the 
awful music they were dancing to. The smooth choreography and 
graceful dancing barely salvaged the act.
The majority of the show was fantastic: The choreography was 
original and creative; the dancers reflected their ideas with style. 
Particularly stellar pieces included Cerulean Stew, The Straight 
and Narrow Path, and Part II of Endless ... Steps to the End.
Cerulean Stew, choreographed by Laura Davis and performed by 
Cindy Chepanoske, Laura Davis, Danielle Friedrichsen, Sara 
Webber, and Dina Ziskin, flowed beautifully to Enyas Caribbean 
Blue. The success of Davis choreography was contingent upon her 
ability to create a symbiotic relationship between the movement 
and the music. This was certainly accomplished; the two elements 
complemented the other marvelously.
Primal is the adjective which best described The Straight and 
Narrow Path, choreographed by Kayt Sukel and performed by 
Allison Buckhammer, Peter Cardona, Alison Meyers, Dutch 
McDonald, Kayt Sukel, and David Schaich. The dancers were 
appropriately accompanied by the rough, primitive rhythms of 
Ajon by Dead Can Dance. The strength of the piece definitely 
rested on the dancers: their physical manifestation of the choreog
raphy was forceful, creating an intense show.
Along the same theme, the heavy beats of Depeche Modes 
Dangerous and Halo were entirely apropos for Part II of Endless 
... Steps to the End, choreographed by Julie McCarthy and per
formed by Jason Field, Julie McCarthy, and Aaron Thomas. The 
piece revolved around the conflicts and unions of an erotic triangle. 
The pairing of the dancers powerful movements and impassioned 
expressions drew the audience into the frantic, disturbing atmo
sphere of the piece.
Movement never lies. It is a barometer telling the state of the soul's 
weather to all who can read itMartha Graham. This statement 
from the renowned choreographer, found in the program of Danc
ers Symposiums Disturbance in Torque, was the perfect summa
tion for the recital. Indeed, the best pieces were the purest expres
sion of the choreographers souls, and their dancers personal 
illustration of the images in the creators minds.igiiauus ocisiuiicj/ iemail riiuiugidpiiei .

Artists myths stir in The TurmoilRoom
It tells the story of a woman 
known as a sort of Venus who 
was brought to London for a 
sideshow. She later diedinParis. 
Scientists then dissected her 
body. Her genitalia were then 
put on display in a Paris mu
seum.
Jacobsons piece covers the 
other window with black plas
tic, shutting off the space inside 
except for three or four peep
holes that the viewer must look 
through. Inside the artist strings 
together a number of images and 
icons, paintings of faces look back 
at us in a sea of Christian iconogaphy and small clay baby fe
tuses. Like other pieces in the 
show, the metaphor comparing 
the political and religious as
pects of society to mythology is 
strongly apparent.
Upon entering the gallery, the 
viewer is presented immediately 
with a frame structure that 
hangs in the middle of the room. 
This work by sophomore Julie 
Vinnette is made of three wood 
frame layers suspended from the 
ceiling. The top is made of a 
weave of roses that as the show 
continues are slowly wilting and 
falling to the ground. The middle 
layer consists of rows of twigs 
that are covered in a white gauze 
and are dripping with honey. 
Candles cover the bottom layer 
and seem to create a cycle. They 
warm the honey and dry the 
roses, all of which fall and cover 
the floor under the work in
drips and splatters of wax, 
honey, and rose petals.
In the rest of the gallery there 
are a number of sculptures and 
small installations. Each are 
equally unique and interesting.
Sophomore Jessica Miller cre
ates a piece that comments on 
the jargon of patriotism and na
tionalism and relates them to 
the happy-ever-afters of the 
traditional childrens fairy tale.
Elsewhere in the gallery are 
sculptures that explore much 
more formal solutions, and

L12The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon <27 April 1992
Comics expert gives iast words of advice
What do you say in a last 
column? How about everything 
you always wanted to say, but 
never did get to fit in. Ive al
ways wanted to write one on 
Superman, but never did quite 
get around to it. Maybe because 
it came out so often, I lost track 
of what was going on after a 
little while and the column would 
have seemed dated. Superman 
was the first comic I can remem
ber buying with the intention of 
collecting. I remember this little 
bookstore in some cheesy subur
ban Maryland mall and the fact 
that it was June, but all the 
comics were cover dated August. 
It was 1978 or 1979  Ive lost 
track. It was an awful book, but 
I bought it because it was Super
man. It is exponentially better 
these days. Buy it. Read it. Its 
filled with gooeyness, idealism, 
and a powerful sense of a type of 
nostalgia.
What else? Some of the best 
comics ever written are dead 
now. Remember Shang-Chi, 
Master of Kung-Fu"? It should 
have been titled the Shang Chi, 
Master of Identity Crisis. Poor 
Shang had a real warped crea
ture for a father. Remember Fu 
Manchu? That nasty fascist was 
Shangs dad, and a recurring 
nemesis. Imagine what a 
screwed up childhood you would 
have had if Hitler were you fa
ther. It was a unique, pioneer
ing book for its time, and such a
COMIC RELIEF
by Waseem Hussain
character-driven book hasnt 
been seen for a very long time. 
Back-issues are cheap and well 
worth investigating.
Remember Rom,Spaceknight? 
That was another comic bom in 
the fires of the late seventies, 
and went on for more than six 
years before it was discontin
ued. It was the story about this 
man who sacrifices his human
ity and becomes a cyborg to fight 
shape-changing demons who are 
about to take over Earth. It had 
a real will Gilligan ever get off 
the island feeling? to it, that for 
some peculiar reason used to be 
a tried and true formula that 
succeeded. Bill Mantlo who 
wrote that book also wrote the 
Hulk for a long time. That was 
another book with the Gilligan 
feel. Will Bruce Banner ever find 
a cure? Hulk was another book, 
like Superman, which has very 
little resemblance to its current 
tone and direction.
Did ev'erythingin comics seem 
to change as President Reagans 
power grew? Any correlation

between the two? When the 
economy was supposedly pros
perous the comic industry ex
panded dramatically and the 
very reasons for reading them 
completely changed. Maybe 
when the Cold War ended, and 
the great enemy fell, people be
gan to turn to comics for their 
hit of world villainy ! Yeah, thats 
it! Comics are necessary for 
world peace.
Now for some high brow 
preaching, if youll forgive me. I 
keep on hearing that demo
graphics show that comics big
gest audience are people around 
twenty. Why is it then, that the 
most generic, worthless books 
sell the most copies? Books that 
can be enjoyed by ages 8 to 12 
are books that sell the best. For 
that matter, everything in 
American pop culture seems to 
be filled with inflated, meatless 
drivel that aims for the lowest 
common denominator. This is 
not a novel complaint, but it is a 
problem that is especially lethal 
to comic books. The market for 
quality comic books is especially 
vulnerable to crowding out by 
mutants and gun toting super 
heroes. Such books already lead 
a fragile existence, and when 
super- hyped generic stuff floods 
the market, they are often the 
first to go, or be buried in a dark 
corner of the store.
The only way to unbury them 
is for people, a lot of people, to
get motivated and buy these un
popular books. Im not just 
speaking about books like 
Eightball or Hate, but also books 
like Wonder Woman or Dr. Fate 
which simply get overlooked 
because theyre not slick enough. 
In the end, books like this either 
get cancelled or end up becom
ing new and improved (i.e. 
more action packed). Moon 
Knight is a glaring example of 
this recurring pattern. As a bril
liant and moody book in the early 
eighties, the book sparkled but 
didnt sell. Now in the books 
third incarnation, it is a pathetic 
shadow of its former self and 
makes Marvel a profit. Moon 
Knight wears a super cool, high
courtesy of DC comics 
tech armor and has special guest 
stars like Ghost Rider and Pun
isher regularly dropping in. Such 
tragedy! This kind of a disaster 
is not Marvels fault. Remem
ber, that the creators are only 
giving us what we want and 
unless we demand better, they 
will continue to do so. We are to 
blame for the failings of popculture.
Comics are more than a hobby 
or diversion, they are a barom
eter of todays culture. Hundreds 
of years from now they will re
main preserved in Mylar bags 
as a testament to the mentality 
and morality of fin de siecle 
America. Change is slow and 
unapparent, but looking back
over the last ten years weve 
seen the rise of a slew of bril
liant books that nobody could 
ever imagine being published. 
Perhaps the next decade will see 
a continuation of this trend, as 
comic books and the tastes of 
American pop culture grow up. 
Grow up America! Stop watch
ing Full House and read Will 
Eisners comic novel, Heart of 
the Storm. Maus is another such 
comic novel, which won a 
Pulitzer Prize this year. Just try 
it, please. There is so much neat 
stuff out there.
Sorry to preach, now its time 
to say good-bye. Thank you Jeff 
Yandora of ye olde Phantom of 
the Attic for so graciously loan
ing me all those comics with 
such generosity. Thanks Steve 
Glicker and Mami Borek for giv
ing me a chance to write and 
keep on writing this column for 
almost three years. Finally, 
thanks to the anonymous any
one who has read a bit or piece of 
this column over the years. I 
hope you found out something 
you didnt know before.

The Man Who Fell To Earth
Heres a little sci-fi thriller to wrap up the semes
ter. It stars one of those rock stars/actors on-theside David Bowie.
Bowie plays an alien who gets trapped on earth in 
this 1976 production. There arent any words to 
really describe this film ... except bizarre. It is 
definitely not a cutesy E. T. -like film because of its 
more adult meaningful themes.
At 6, 8:30,11.
Friday, May 1
Cape Fear
Revenge is the motive that sets up this 1991 hit 
film Cape Fear, starring Nick Nolte, Robert De Niro, 
Jessica Lange, and Juliette Lewis. Based on the 50s 
film of the same name, the storyline takes movie 
audiences on a fearful rollercoaster ride.
De Niro plays convict Max Cody, who spends his 
years in jail improving his physical strength and 
reading the Bible. When he is finally released, he 
has only one thing on his mind  to destroy the 
lawyer (Nolte) who concealed evidence and allowed 
him to go to jail for rape. Cody does not harass the 
attorney, his wife (Lange) and his daughter (Lewis) 
in any conventional manner. He is able to skirt the 
law almost completely. For example, he assaults a 
woman with whom Nolte is having an affair. He 
knows that charges will not be pressed because 
Noltes relationship with her would be dragged into 
the courthouse.
This film is a must see. It will keep audiences on 
the edge of their seats the entire time in a very 
Hitchcockian manner. There is no action by the 
characters that is predictable and this trait is what 
instills the fear.The movie will be shown on the Mall 
providing good weather.
At 9,11:30.
Saturday, May 2
The Hand That Rocks The 
Cradle
The Hand That Rocks The Cradle has basically 
the same underlying theme as Cape Fear  re
venge. The main character is once again a slick 
manipulator who manages to weasle her way into a 
family and destroy it little by little.
Rebecca DeMornay portrays a woman destroyed 
by her gynecologist husbands suicide. As a direct 
result she miscarries her child. She decides to destroy 
the life of the woman who accused her husband of 
sexual misconduct. She becomes a nanny for the 
woman and little by little wins over her children and 
makes an attempt to seduce her husband. When
ever someone notices that something is fishy, 
DeMornay destroys them.
Though a bit predictable and overdramatic, The 
Hand That Rocks The Cradle is a quality film with 
an interesting plot that explores serious issues such 
as child care and sexual crimes. Its worth a look.
At 6, 8,10, midnight.
Sunday, May 3
Bugsy
This Barry Levinson film didnt win the big Os
cars, but it certainly did get acclaim for being one of 
Warren Beattys best films to date.
Bugsy unravels the story of mobster Bugsy Siegel 
 the building of his empire in Las Vegas and his 
torrid affair with actress Virginia Hill (played, ap
propriately, by Annette Bening). The film also fo
cuses on Bugsys desire to become a Hollywood star.
One of the highlights of the film are the costumes. 
Beatty and Bening are impeccably dressed in their 
mid-forties/fifties apparel.
If you are looking for a love story and mob story 
rolled into one, Bugsy is the film to see. The story 
moves along quickly, the violence isnt so violent, 
and the chemistry between Beatty and Bening is 
extraordinary.
At 6, 8,10, midnight.

Are you a television addict?
Picture this: its Wednesday, 
and youve just finished a rough 
day of classes. You turn on the 
TV, just for a little while, to 
relax and zone out. After flick
ing the remote for a few min
utes, you settle on a Perfect 
Strangers repeat. At seven, you 
start to turn it off but notice that 
Night Court is on. Its been a 
while since youve seen it; so it 
might be fan.
At the next ad break, you re
member that The Wonder Years, 
one of your favorites, is on at 
eight. It seems a waste to turn 
off the TV now, so you spend 30 
minutes flipping between Wheel 
of Fortune, Entertainment To
night, and Married... with Chil
dren.
After The Wonder Years is 
Boogie Howser M.D. and Sein
feld, andthenmayb eDearJohn. 
By ten, turning off the tube no 
longer seems to be a viable op
tion. After all, Quantum Leap 
provides a worthwhile diversion, 
and theres always I Love Lucy 
repeats on the New 22.
Before you know it, Daves 
saying goodnight to Paul, and 
its past your bedtime. Rousing 
yourself from a sleepless slum
ber, you stare around blankly, 
wondering where all the time 
went and why you feel so tired.
Sound familiar? Come on, ad
mit it; weve all had similar ex
periences. We sit down to watch 
TV for a half-hour and end up 
soaking in rays for the rest of the 
night.
How does this happen? How 
can a small rectangular box, in a 
matter of hours, turn reason
able, intelligent college students 
into drooling zombies?
The answer is quite simple: 
TV is a drug.
You heard me right. That everglowing presence has a big ef
fect on the way we think, act, 
and feel.
Now, this is no big news. Ever 
since Newton Minow declared 
television a vast wasteland in 
1962, critics have attacked the 
evils of the boob tube. It has 
been called everything from 
junk food for the brain to the 
tool of Satan. TV is numbing, 
TV encourages laziness, TV dis
courages conversation, TV is ru
ining Americas children, TV is 
destroying the world: weve 
heard it all before.
My message is different. I love 
TV  Im fascinated by it. For 
the past three semesters, Ive 
sung its praises weekly in this 
column. I find many of the atTHE LAUGH TRACK
by A. Franklin Wheeler
tacks on television unwarranted 
and unjustified. Im not here to 
damn TV; in fact, Ill defend it 
with all my strength.
But I dont want to paint a 
dishonest, rosy picture. TV is a 
drug  one that is easily addic
tive and quite dangerous.
Still dont believe me? Stay 
tuned just a little bit longer  
you may be addicted. Theres a 
difference between watching 
television and blindly accepting 
it. Try to remember all (or most, 
or any) of the TV shows you 
watched last week. Now try to 
estimate the total number of 
hours you spent in front of the 
screen last week. Not too easy, 
is it?
Fact is, each television experi
ence should be memorable (if 
not valuable). If you cant re
member what you watched last 
week, perhaps you should ask 
yourself why you were watching 
in the first place. Were you 
thinking of other things while 
the canned laughter chortled in 
the background? Were you 
thinking at all?
I can hear my detractors. TV 
doesnt have to be memorable, 
they say; theres nothing wrong 
with relaxing for a little while, 
forgetting the pressures of real 
life, and letting some harmless 
TV fiction soak in. I think thats 
true, to an extent. The problem 
is that a little while often 
turns into a viewing marathon. 
The longer the TVs on, the 
harder it is to turn off.
For those who are beginning 
to worry about this (and for 
those who still dont think Im 
talking to them), Ive constructed 
a little quiz:
 On average, do you watch 
three or more hours of television 
daily? (Be honest!)
V ol you watch certain shows 
religiously every day, even if 
youve seen them before?
 Have you missed classes or 
work to watch TV?
 In the past two weeks, have 
you seen four or more episodes 
of any of the following: Threes 
Company, Mr. Belvedere, Matlock, Mama's Family, Hunter, 
Full House?
 Do you always (or almost 
always) watch TV by yourself?
 Do you turn the TV on when 
theres nothing better to do (in
stead of turning it on to watch a 
specific program)?
If you answered yes to any of 
these questions, it might be time 
to take a serious look at your 
viewing habits.
Luckily, this problem has a 
solution. As I said before, I love 
TV. I think it can be valuable, if 
you control it  and dont allow 
it to control you.
First step: planning. Decide 
which shows you want to watch 
(if any), and then watch them  
and only them. On Monday, 
Murphy Brown and Northern 
Exposure are my series of choice;
the damn thing off.
Of course, all this is easier 
said than done. Even I am guilty 
of breaking these rules: Ive 
spent many a lunch with Archie 
Bunker, and I find The Brady 
Bunch irresistible. We all slip 
into passive viewing occasion
ally, and a periodic binge is OK 
If youre aware that youre 
wasting time on mindless TV, 
then youll probably be able to 
stop when you want to.
You can even work such occa
sions into your TV schedule. 
More than once, Ive said, I am 
going to spend the entire eve-ing 
watching butt-numbing sit
coms. And I do just that. Yes, I 
give my brain up for a few hours 
to the power of TV, but Im still 
in control.
Control is the key. Its easy to
on Tuesday, I watch only 
Roseanne. Dont watch Coach 
because theres nothing else on: 
watch it because you enjoy it.
Second step: limiting. Keep 
your daily viewing down to two 
or three programs. After three 
hours of TV, youre a zombie, no 
matter how good the show is.
Third step: questioning. If you 
find yourself taking in a show 
you dont really enjoy, ask your
self two questions: What am I 
watching? and Why am I 
watching TV now? If you cant 
come up with good answers, turn
Daniel Frey/Tartan Art Editor
get sucked in by all the pretty 
moving pictures, especially 
when you let your guard down. 
Be an active viewer; bring your 
brain with you to the couch. Its 
up to you: you dont have to stay 
tuned for whats on nextand 
you dont have to laugh when 
the Laugh Track tells you to.

W.C. in + D.J. KID 
FLASH
W.C. Ill + DJ KID 
FLASH 
???
It seems that nowadays ev
eryone is rapping. Rap music is 
probably the most influential 
form of music around now. Its 
everywhere, and everyone is try
ing to capitalize on it. There are 
even radio advertisements for 
beer that have famous rap 
groups bustin a ryhme to pro
mote it. Rap is definitely big, 
and with more artists turning to 
rap every day, the industry is 
innundated with fly-by-night 
artists. Youreally have to search 
around for a talented up-and 
coming rap artist who is really 
about rap as an artform, rather 
than a means of quick fame and 
cash.
Could W.C. Ill and D.J. Kid 
Flash be such artists? And could 
they be cultivating their fame 
right here on our campus? Well, 
you never know! W.C. Ill a din
ing service employee (aka Walter 
Cusick), and D.J. Kid Flash a 
record producer have taken a lot 
of time and effort to put together 
a self-titled debut album. Their 
hard work is evident in the
lyrics that W.C. Ill drops with a 
touch of style. The album, up
beat and dance-oriented, basi
cally talks about such things as 
college life, parties, and dating. 
In Harmonys the Message, 
W.C.III talks about racism, and 
the need to unite, regardless of 
skin color. W.C.III displays his

bum would surprise most, if they 
didnt know the producing back
ground of Kid Flash. He has 
worked with the R&B group 
LeVert, and has dee-jayed for 
the rap group Kid-N-Play. These 
two artists arent just producing 
a watered down version of the 
ancient style party-rap as some 
supposed rap artists have, in 
order to gain fame.
With enough local radio air
play, and exposure, W.C.III and 
D.J. Kid Flash have the poten
tial to make it big. More impor
tantly they have the potential to 
let everyone else know all about 
the Kid Flash Theme while 
staying true to the art form of 
rap.

Spooky
Lush
irk'k'km
If you like The Stone Roses, 
and The Happy Mondays, then 
you will love this Manchester 
band. The bands name, Lush, 
conjures many images, yet, the 
CD Spooky, beautifully calms 
the senses with its melodious 
instrumental background in
stead of the cacophony one might 
expect.
Spooky is Lushs follow-up to 
Gala. The new CD release suc
cessfully displays the bands re
markable qualities. The echo
ing vocals of Emma Anderson 
and Miki Berenyi are angelic, 
sweet, and soothing. At the same 
time, the guitars and drums have 
a strong rhythym and beat. Al
together, the music pieces are 
highly relaxing and leave an airy 
feeling inside of your head be
cause of the sensuality of the 
voices and instruments.
My favorites are Ocean and 
Monochrome, which just so 
happens to be the images on the 
CD cover. Both have the glori
ous serenity it forecasts.
Andersons and Berenyis vo
cals are sugary sweet and are
only a level higher than a whis
per. Both of their voices are in 
the same range so when echoing 
effects are needed in songs, they 
compliment one another per
fectly.
The one problem with the al
bum is the lyrics. The vocals 
blend so well together that it is 
almost impossible to make out 
any of the words.
Despite this flaw, Spooky is 
the perfect music to listen to 
with all the stress each of us face 
as the term nearly ends. I 
strongly suggest you buy this 
CD or at least borrow and dubb 
it from someone because its doc
ile tunes just might make life a 
little more bearable.

CMU environmentalist revealed
as pawn of right-wing groups
Campus expresses surprise, indifference
many votes as his more conser
vative rival, Arkansas Gover
nor Bill Clinton.
 Also cited is the failure of 
Pittsburgh Earth Day activities 
to attract more than a handful of 
participants. Organizers have 
confirmed that food at the event 
was served in disposable plastic 
dishes, with plastic cutlery and 
disposable napkins, and was 
high in meat products and cho
lesterol.
The students, who spoke on 
condition of anonymity for fear 
of reprisal, also claim that J oshy 
had been using the Student Sen
ate office in Skibo to run 
Buchanans campaign for the 
Republican nomination.
Student Senator Michael 
Loomis (R-GSIA), when asked 
to comment on the allegations, 
was evasive.
Fell, he said. F&R is mine. 
Tall can have it back when Im 
done with it. However, he later 
confirmed that Joshy has made 
and received many lengthy and 
unaccounted-for phone calls in 
the Senate office, frequently dis
rupting Senate business. Hes 
also made assignations with pale 
thin women with long hair. I 
think hes probably hetero
sexual, Loomis said.
Campus environmentalists 
expressed little surprise when 
informed of the consortiums 
support for Joshy, saying they 
had suspected a plot to paint the 
environmental movement as 
foolish and hysterical.
They noted a protest organized 
by Joshy concerning a Pittsburgh-ara resident whom 
neighbors say was weeding 
maple saplings from his garden 
plot. It was a travesty against 
nature, said Joshy. The defor
estation of garden plots is clearly 
a conspiracy of the white male 
capitalist patriarchy.
What chance do we have? 
Whos going to take environmen
talists seriously with this guy 
around? said a representative 
from EarthSome-wherelnThe 
Running!, a campus environ
mental group. Whoevers oper
ating him has a very sophisti
cated plan. Damn those corpo
rate interests, anyway, said the 
representative, who identified 
himself only as Leaf.
Joshy manages a rival organizationknown as Student EnviroLink, which sponsored the garden-plot deforestation protest.
Many suspect that Student 
Enviro-Link is actually a front 
for WTI, which is building a 
toxic-waste incinerator upwind 
of Pittsburgh. Weve put a lot of 
pressure on WTI to halt con
struction, and it makes sense 
that theyd want to run a mole 
like Joshy to screw us up, said 
Leaf. Hes a professional, 111 
give him that.
A sample of campus opinion 
indicates that the influence of 
outside forces on campus activi
ties is not a major concern. If 
everyone were vegetarians, it 
would be impossible for this kind 
of plan to succeed, said a stu
dent who bears a suspicious re
semblance to an oft-missing car
toon character.
What? I have five papers and
10 exams. Leave me alone, said 
someone else.

H&SS Freshman Joshua Joshy Knauer, contemplating his master 
plan of world domination.
The Natrat has learned that 
freshman Joshy Knauers CMU 
tuition is being paid by a consor
tium of political and business 
interests, including such diverse 
parties as presidential hopeful 
Patrick J. Buchanan, and Waste 
Technologies Incorporated 
(WTI), a toxic-waste disposal 
company.
Sources in the consortium, 
which apparently funds students 
at a number of colleges in the 
predominantly liberal northeast, 
say its objective is to establish a 
fifth column to undermine and

son Pollyanna Pottroast, GSO 
Rep ?????, Stupid Students Presi
dent Natalie Gesmond, Money 
Guy Jay Laefer.
Approval of the Last Epi
sode: Tomblyn complained that 
there werent enough women in 
the cast, and he couldnt get an 
affair. They promised me that 
last week I would get one, but I 
didnt anyway, he said. The di
rector, Matt McGarvey, pointed 
out to him that since he did not 
actually have an affair last week, 
the last episode could not be 
changed to reflect that he had. 
Tomblyn sulked. The last epi
sode was approved as it stands.
. Special Business: Pollyanna 
Pottroast and Joshie Knauer 
wanted money to hold a divorce 
party at Grand Concourse. The 
director asked why theyre get
ting divorced, and Pollyanna 
answered, Its in the script, and 
Iso I couldnt stand talking 
about environmentalism any
more. Joshie jumped up and 
said, Well I was tired of not 
being able to eat any meat! 
Pollyanna tried to hit him, but 
was held back. Joshie started to 
cry. They withdrew tjieir request 
for money because they decided 
they didnt want to be in the 
same room any longer than nec
essary. Other members of the 
cast congratulated them on the 
scene, commentingthat it would 
make a good clip for the Emmies.
Audience Participation: 
One angry member of the audi
ence berated the cast for being 
too incestuous. All you ever do 
is have affairs with each other, 
fight, get married, get divorced. 
What about the rest of us, I ask 
you? You should care about us 
too, we all want a little love, not 
to mention sex. Is that so 
baaaaad? The cast members 
looked confused, then returned 
to their bickering.
Committee Reports:
Academic Affairs: Mike 
Tomblyn had a meeting at 6 pm 
tonight. Unfortunately, he was 
grazed by a falling girder as he 
passed the GSIA construction 
site on the way to this weeks 
episode, and had amnesia of the 
short-term memory. He could 
therefore not give any report, as 
he could not remember what 
happened at the meeting.
Funding & Recognition: 
Michael Loomis and Amy Blake 
reported that their amnesia 
(caused two weeks ago by being 
run over by a stampeding herd 
of baggers who were trying to 
escape before CMU sucked them 
in) was miraculously cured (they
were struck by lightning). They 
were pleased tig'say that they 
now recognize all the other cast 
members again. Michael also 
said that he remembered who 
he was having an affair with, 
but since he wasnt sure that 
person knew, he did not give the 
name.
Public Relations: No report 
because the entire PR commit
tee was carried away by that 
tornado that hit town last week.
Rules: Eric Moore reported 
his frustration at the return of 
characters killed,off last season. 
Look, folks, we liave to be con
sistent. If someone is decapi
tated, theyre dead. Theres noth
ing we can do about it. If their 
body is over here; and their head 
is over here, theyrd just dead. 
Cancelled. Over&nd done with. 
In the ensuing uproar, comments 
were made about the miracles of 
modern medicine, and how 
would Eric like it if he were 
decapitated and that was just 
it? What kind of a career would 
that be?
Ex-Officio Reports:
AJB: Eric Nightwine could not 
give a report because he couldnt 
speak  a bad: experience in
volving cockroaches and shower 
stalls left him mute. A specialist 
was expected to join the cast and 
try to miraculously cure him.
SDC: Pollyanna Pottroast re
fused to give a report because 
she decided she wasnt speaking 
to Joshie Knauer and he was 
within earshot. Tlie director sug
gested she write down the name 
of the SDC movie/of the week so 
the rest of the cast would know
ii Tt
whatit was, but that plan failed. 
Unbeknownst to the rest of the 
cast, Pollyanna never learned 
how to use a pen.
Greek Council: No one could 
understand the report, as it was 
in Greek.
GSO (Graduate Student 
Organization): No one present 
to give a report. The director 
commented that he heard some 
graduate students comment that 
theyre too busy to spend their 
time with something as dumb as 
As the Gavel Falls. They all like 
L.A. Law better.
Faculty Senate: Mike 
Murphy had no report, and it 
was revealed that he doesnt 
actually go to Faculty Senate 
rehearsals, because the meet
ingtime conflicts withL.A. Law.
Stupid Affairs: Tim Foster 
complained that it was stupid 
that Amy Blake and Chris 
Neighbor were trying to keep 
their affair a secret, since every
one knew about it anyway. He 
was surprised when Moneet 
Singh threw a chair across the 
room, yelling, Amy, you lying 
little worm! You told me you and 
Chris were finished. Amy said 
softly, Please dont be angry 
with me, Moneet. That was be
fore I found out about the baby. 
Yes, said Chris, Im pregnant. 
The audience gasped, and Tim 
Foster said, Well, that explains 
a few things. .
Officer Reports:
President: Natalie Gesmond 
reported, that she broke two of 
her nails on a Tartan burger. 
Oh, I thought they were crunchy 
this week, said Tony DeRoss.
, The audience groaned. Burt 
Holtzman asked how Natalies 
wedding was. Oh, I left him at 
the altar, she said. I just 
couldnt go through with it after 
I found out he slept with my 
dog.
Treasurer: Jay Laefer re
ported that he didnt thinkthere 
would be enough money for the 
production of the rest of the 
semesters shows, due to in
creased marriage expenses and 
lots of legal fees. The audience 
applauded.
Director: Matt McGarvey re
ported that a secret committee 
has been deciding whose con
tracts will be renewed and who 
will be booted. Five cast mem
bers propositioned him on the 
 spot. No, wait, Im not on the 
committee, he said. The others 
immediately withdrew their of
fers, then made offers to each 
/other for good measure. Mike 
Tomblyn said he was on the com
mittee, but no one believed him.
' No fair, he said, and sulked.
Matt announced the Emmy 
nominations received by cast 
members. Brennan Kraje re
ceived one for his performance 
in the scene Im a graduate stu
dent and I really care about Stu
pid Senate. The cast agreed that 
his tears looked real and that 
playing My Country Tis of 
Thee in the background was a 
1 nice touch. Robert Earhart also 
received a nomination for his 
performance of I know I 
gshouldnt call the previous ques
tion but I will if you dont all 
i shut up.
D New Business: Mike
Tomblyn said he wanted to have 
an affair this week since he 
couldnt have one last week. Its 
in my contract, he said. The 
director agreed and assigned 
him a partner.
Chris Neighbor made a mo
tion to send out a search party to 
locate the missing PR commit
tee. Vote: 1-2-28. Motion fails. 
Comments: Fred Trudwig said 
the PR committee spent too 
much money on Natrat ads any
way. Director Matt McGarvey 
said it wouldnt do a lot to ad
vance the plot.
Michael Loomis said good-bye 
to everyone, since hes decided 
to elope with Raoul. Wait a 
minute! Whos Raoul? shouted 
the cast in unison. Hes been 
around for weeks! Are you 
blind? answered the audience, 
also in unison.
Discussion:
Im Pollyanna Pottroasts fa
ther, announced Erik Altmann. 
Years ago I met this woman 
and next thing you know, here I 
am on As the Gavel Falls and 
heres this woman, and she has 
my nose! So, unbeknownst to all 
of you, I took a DNA sample, had 
it tested at a clinic in Sweden, 
and found out that shes my 
daughter. Pollyanna said 
breathlessly, Oh, I never knew 
who my father was and I always 
wanted to and Im so happy and 
now we can live together and go 
to father-daughter banquets and 
eat soybean hot dogs and every
thing! Everyone else threw up.
Meeting adjourned eventually.

Llama problems 
will not go away
There was a fellow named Egil. He 
was a sly and wily fellow and the worst 
of troublemakers  a true scoundrel. 
His wife was a fair woman, though 
harsh, and was named Ick, but she 
 plays no part in this tale.
Egil grew weary of his native Ice. land and sailed away, seeking glory 
. and riches. He fought many battles, 
full of slaughter, and came away victo
rious. He later returned to Iceland 
with five warships.
He immediately sought out his kins
man, Hogni, and was greeted with a 
ITwarm welcome. Egil gave Hogni a gold 
ring, a cap from Russia, and an axe 
with the handle bound in gold wire. 
Hogni was most impressed, and in
vited Egil to stay with him for the 
winter. Egil did stay the winter with 
Hogni, and when the spring came he 
Hold Hogni that he meant to leave. 
Where will you go? Hogni asked. 
I will take a gift to the king, Egil 
said, and he will see me for what I am; 
a tall, strong, handsome, well bred 
man, proud and excellent at most 
skills.
What will you take the king? Hogni 
asked, not wanting to speak of the 
-obvious to his kinsman.
A strange beast, Egil said, one 
which I captured from Vikings.
Egil sent one of his stout men to the 
warships. The man soon returned, lead
ing a strange beast which looked some
thing like a tall thin foal.
It is indeed a strange beast, Hogni 
;said, what manner of animal is it?
; It is called a llama, Egil said.
I Hogni reached to touch the strange 
beast before Egil could utter a warn
ing. The llama bit Hogni on the arm so 
fiercely that the bones were broken 
and the hand came off. Hogni drew his 
axe, but death came upon him quickly, 
and he fell upon the ground. Egil had
the body covered with stones, then 
went to meet the king.
He had not gone a mile before he was 
confronted by the sons of Hogni, Hroald 
and Tjorvi. They were both proud men, 
but headstrong and short of temper.
Where is our father? Tjorvi said.
He has been killed, Egil said, by 
the llama.
What is the llama ? Hroald asked.
It is this strange beast, Egil said.
Hroald and Tjorvi looked at the 
llama, and agreed that it was indeed a 
very strange beast. Hroald reached 
out to touch it before Egil could utter a 
warning. The llama kicked at Hroald, 
splitting his shield asunder, the hooves 
entering the chest cavity, and Hroald 
fell dead instantly. Tjorvi hurled his 
spear but missed the llama, instead 
impaling Egil to the ground. The llama 
charged Tjorvi fearlessly, biting him 
in the head so that the brains spilled 
across the ground in heaping clots and 
the teeth scattered like coins.
The llama was later hunted down, 
but the llama plague had begun. 
Thorir, son of Njal, son of Otkel, once 
said that Egil deserved to have his 
steaming entrails drawn from his body 
and looped around his neck until he 
choked for having brought the llama 
to Iceland. The name of Egil was cursed 
ever after.
Translated, from the Icelandic
The Icelanders suffered great losses 
at the hooves and jaws of one llama  
imagine the carnage caused if the hun
dreds of llamas in captivity today es
caped. We cannot afford to wait until 
the llama menace rises up again.
How many times must a young child 
be hurt until people stand up and take 
notice? Act now  in the upcoming 
election vote the anti-llama ticket!
Lightning strike changes views
A remarkable experience has changed 
my life for the better. While walking 
along the Cut, I was struck by a freak 
bolt of lightning. When I recovered my 
senses, the world seemed a different 
place.
I walked by the Tartan Grill and 
found my self repulsed by the rabid 
consumption of meat and meat by-prod
ucts. Pounding on the windows, I 
shouted Animals have feelings too! 
Theyre also too smart to be eaten wan
tonly! A big guy, with a greaseburger 
in each hand, came up to me. As for the 
intelligent animal argument, he said 
snidely, have you ever seen a chicken 
discuss world politics? Have you ever 
held a productive conversation with 
cows? The only thing they say is Moo! 
Moo! right before they make that 
Sizzle! Sizzle!sound. Helaughedand 
walked away. I decided to leave, but he 
called after me.
Id like to invite everyone to the 
CMU Carnivores/Picnic for Apathy gettogether. Well be having all-meat food 
products and music by meat eaters. In 
addition to that, we have a special sur
prise  fresh cow meat. And boy do I 
mean fresh. Well have a live cow there. 
You get to pick what piece you would 
like for hamburgers or a steak. Well 
use an electric knife to slice that piece 
and then throw it right on the grill. 
Check the University Calendar for time 
and place!
I seethed, but decided that I was 
getting nowhere. I left in a hurry when 
the big guy started to walk towards me 
again.
I came across a pile of scrap paper 
which had blown out of a trash barrel. 
I hurried to gather them up, and was 
furious when I couldnt find a paper 
recycling can nearby. A young woman 
walked up behind me. Well, she 
drawled, The Natrat should never be 
published again. In keeping with envi
ronmentalism, all news should be re
cycled every week. (Not that this would 
really be different from what Bender 
McWheelie does now.) It should then be 
distributed not by regular printing but 
by email. Of course, all computers on 
campus should be solar powered (so we 
dont burn fossil fuels) and should be 
made out of environmentally friendly 
materials that were created by veg
etarians who didnt test them on cute 
little furry animals. When I started to 
protest, she laughed in my face and 
walked away.
A few minutes later I disposed of the 
waste paper in an environmentally con
scious way.
I looked in a mirror and suddenly 
realized that I wasnt just white any
more. My seven different ethnic backgrouds came rising to the surface. I 
was striped  a minority of 
one. It occurred to me that I 
wanted everyone to know what 
had happened to me. The idea 
of multiculturalism began to 
make sense, and I ran to the 
provosts office to urge him to 
institute a truly multicultural 
curriculum at CMU. He blew 
me off.
Suddenly, I felt ill. My stom
ach began to quiver and heave.
I realized quickly I was suffer
ing decades of repressed guilt 
over racial injustice and eco nomic discrimination towards 
minorities. I felt better after 
throwing up in the bushes, but 
I made a mental note to dash 
off a contribution to the 
NAACP.
Speaking of contributions, I 
went to Financial Aid, too, and 
wrote a check to be given to 
some student to help pay his or 
her tuition. Thats right, I 
wanted to help other people 
pay for their college educations, 
because even though I used to
think financial aid was bad and every
one should pay for themselves and if 
they couldnt, well, they must have doiie 
something to deserve it, I didnt think 
that anymore. Well, that and my par
ents are rich, too.
By now I was starting to scare myself. 
I mean, I was starting to do stuff Hidethe 
Shooters, Natrat Dominatrix, would do. 
I was feeling sympathetic toward femi
nists and everything! Fortunately, "I 
ran into Pat Mooney, and he promised 
that hed work with me over the sum
mer so that by fall, I would be back to 
my old right-wing self. I owe him a vote 
from gratitude.
Brow- no, Bu- Bu- Buchanan in 92!
Pat Hybrid is a striped minority of 
one who is a sort of multicultural cre
ation [him? her?] self.

The latest rage in cooking 
these days is rats. These furry 
rodents are replacing beef in 
most households, due to their 
low cost and ease of avail
ability. Gourmet cooks are 
beginning to liquefy rats for 
quicker consumption  rat 
frapp and rat pure are the 
newest culinary delights to 
appear in fine restaurants. 
We asked these true gour
mets, How do you blend 
your rats?

Ive never heard of someone 
else blending rats. Ive been 
doing it all along. I dont know 
what all of this copy-cat crap is. 
Well, actually I saw a rat blended 
once, but it wasnt for food. Well, 
he ate it, but he didnt mean to. 
Eat it, that is. Anyway, I changed 
it.

rats?! I cant believe it! Its hor
rible! Its sick! They eat them? 
Gross! I love it!

The best way is to lower it 
slowly in, butt first. Then it 
squeals and stuff, and thats 
a lot of fun. Then you drop it 
in, and start with the next 
one, so it can see its friends 
face spinning around as it 
gets chopped up. Its great! I 
dont think they taste good, 
though.

To blend rats has always been 
a fantasy of mine. Since the sud
den social acceptance of the rats 
a gourmet food, I have devoted 
much time to the various meth
ods of liquefying. I have found 
that the best way is to drop the 
rat into the blender, then turn 
the blender on. Seven to eight 
minutes is the perfect time.

What kind of sick bastard 
would blend a rat? Its a nearly 
inhuman kind of thing to do  
grinding up a living, breathing, 
furry animal. Its sick. Id shoot 
the damn thing.

My Press Pass
By Chicken McNugget
Llamas 
attract 
hasbeen
The first time I saw a llama, 
I was five years old. I was 
playing Little League baseball, 
Little League football, Pee 
Wee soccer, Pee Wee lacrosse, 
and Pee Wee bowling. So 
anyway, when I took some 
time out for my family,my 
parents took me to the zoo and 
I saw my first llama. It spat on 
me,and I hated it, but I knew 
that there \yas something 
special about me and llamas.
When I heard that there was 
going to be a sporting event 
with llama^, it was about the 
time I was graduating with 
nothing to do but be a Little 
League coach. Why not coach 
little league llama hurdling?
Of course, my Little League 
baseball coach, Ralph 
DeStefano will be disappointed 
that I wont be following in his 
footsteps. Thats okay. I mean, 
I think this is what I really 
want to do.
I always wanted to be a 
Little League coach. Well, I 
know I cant ever be as good as 
any of my childhood coaches, 
so I thought Id coach a totally 
new event.
Yeah, Ill make my mark in 
llama hurdling. Ive already 
bought the Run PenPals 
Llama Hurdling for Begin
ners video. Ive watched it 16 
times in the last three days.
Its going to be tough, but I 
think that I can really give 
these kids something.
Actually, last week there 
was only one kid signed up.
But I remember, I was the 
only kid signed up for Little 
League football when I was 
twelve. That was when I 
decided that I was going to 
sign up for all the Little 
League and Pee Wee sports. I 
was a total athlete and no one 
ever recognized me for it. If I 
signed up for all the other 
teams, then at least if I never 
got off the bench, I could root 
for everyone else and pretend I 
was a part of the team.
Yeah, if these kids really 
love the sport of llama hur
dling, then I can live vicari
ously through them and 
pretend that I too am a llama 
hurdler of world class ability.
I always wanted to have 
something to do with llamas. I 
think this is a great way to 
connect the world of sports 
and the animal kingdom.
In fact, I went to the zoo 
yesterday with my girlfriend 
and she really liked the llama 
too. Well, she liked it because I 
liked it  it spat on her too. 
But, you know, it was worse 
for her because she is a woman 
and shes 20 years old. I was a 
three-year-old boy. I was tough 
even then, and my extraordi
nary athletic prowess proves 
that I was a real man.
Yes, I am a real man. I am a 
real man because I can take 
my girlfriend to the zoo and 
not feel that my masculinity is 
being threatened by missing 
the baseball game on TV for it; 
because I played all the Little 
League sports there were; and 
because I am now going to 
coach Little League. Im going 
to take the llama world by 
storm. Hey, why not?
Chicken McNugget is leaving 
the Natrat soon to coach llama 
hurdling to poor kids wholl 
have to listen to his stories.

with his llama to the starting gate of last Saturday's race. In his 
fathers arms, he is safe from the llama spit that may interrupt his 
concentration before the race. Bowd came in second.

Carnegie Mellon hosted the 
Llama Olympics at Gelding Sta
dium last weekend. The Olym
pics attracted nearly 10,000 
people, more people than Geld
ing has ever held for any other 
event. In fact, record attendance 
at Gelding was 550  that was 
to see a certain spectacle on the 
50-yard-line last fall.
Includedinthe Olympics, were 
the llama races, the llama 
hurdles and the llama chase. 
Also, the Intervarsity Llama 
Association (ILA) championship 
title events coincided with the 
Olympics.
The only filed event included 
in the games was the llama dis
tance spitting contest, in which 
each participant coaxes their 
llama to spit on them from a 
distance. The one to get spit on 
from the farthest distance won. 
This years winner was Hawk 
Onme, who coaxed his llama to a 
spit distance of 25 feet. Onme 
won the stadium record. Of 
course, no ones ever done it in 
Gelding before, but it was still 
an honor for Onme. I cant be
lieve that I won. I broke the 
recordspit never felt so good, 
said Onme.
The ILA had to import special 
starting gates from Peru, where 
llama sports are quite popular, 
in order to hold the llama races. 
ILA chairperson, Lorenzo Lla
mas said, It was worth the
money to import the gates. If we 
can spark a real interest in llama 
racing, then we will really be 
raking it in. The goal is to get 
this country to the point where 
they like llamas just as much as 
they love horses and dogs  we 
(want then to bet on the llamas. 
Of his previous television ca
reer on the weekly drama, Fal
con Crest, Llamas said, I actu
ally make more money in llama 
racing. This is what I am really 
happy doing. Im also making a 
mark and carrying on the family 
name in a way I know my parrents would be proud. Falcon 
Crest was all about the wrong 
>animal. I would have been hapipier on Llama Breast but they 
wanted someone with a bigger 
name. Llama racing is good 
enough for me.
The CMU Athletic Director, 
John Harvey said he is very glad 
to introduce llama sporting 
events to the CMU community. 
He hopes that this exposure will 
broaden the horizons of our ath
letes. Said Intramurals Direc
tor E. J. Birdy, Were hoping to 
see some IM Llama hurdling. 
Right now, we just dont have 
the facility for any of the races 
those gates are pretty expen
sive. Post your entries in the IM 
Office if youre interested. 
q; Llamas said that the first 
Llama Olympics were held at 
CMU because CMU already has 
& history of making a tradition 
out of strange races. This 
seemed like the perfect place for
something bizarre like llama 
racing, said Lamas.
The races were perceived as a 
lot of fun, and apparently they 
made quite an impression on 
the weird racers of CMU. Last 
night there was a rally on the 
lawn where members of the 
CMU community demonstrated 
their interest in replacing the 
traditional Buggy races with 
llama events. Almost 200 stu
dents marched in favor of chang
ing the tradition.
The rally caused a little more 
commotion when opposingforces 
marched in. Leader of the tradi
tionalists was Rabid McRage 
who claimed that, If we do these 
llama races instead of buggy, 
well be supporting cruelty to 
animals. There is a lot of re
search that shows how much 
the llamas dislike the racesit 
really messes up their minds. In 
fact, I was talking to a llama the 
other day and it almost started 
crying about how much it really 
hurts to get ankled in the [derriere].
Fortunately, the marchers just 
went home. Nothing bad hap
pened. The Llama Olympics cer
tainly got attention from CMU. 
According to a recent report from 
Birdy, eight people have already 
posted entries for IM Llama 
Hurdling.
Llamas and Harvey are hop
ing to hold the 1993 Olympics in 
Gelding as well. Its going to 
draw a lot of recruits for the 
track team, said Harvey.PenPal's World Llama hurdling tour dazzles CMU
By LOU LARK
Special to the Natrat
Carnegie Mellons Llama 
Olympics featured the llama 
hurdles yesterday in Gelding 
Stadium. The leading contender 
for the Intervarsity Llama Asso
ciation championship title was 
junior industrial design major 
Run PenPal. PenPalis currently 
out of school and on a six month 
world tour called, Llama Hur
dling Around the World.
PenPal, originally from Peru, 
began llama hurdling on a whim 
at the age of five. PenPal said, 
It was hard because I was so 
small, but my parents bought 
me a trampoline so that I could 
practice jumping very high. Now, 
it just comes naturally.
PenPals father, Pedro PenPal, 
was a llama hurdler as a young 
man, but was never good enough 
to hurdle professionally. I am 
so proud of my son. It was al
ways my dream to hurdle lla
mas, and now he is living my 
dream.
PenPals mother, Maria 
PenPal, is also very proud that 
her son is spreading the great 
tradition of llama hurdling to 
the United States. Its a 
mothers dream come true. I 
want my son to have everything 
I didnt have  I started milk
ing llamas when I was ttoee 
years old. Now my son is jump
ing them. My family has come a 
long way.
PenPal said that one of the 
major drawbacks of llama hur
dling is that the llamas are al
ways walking away and it is 
hard to time his stride. How
ever, a far worse obstacle is pre
sented by the easily angered lla
mas. If you so much as tap them 
the wrong way  like you can 
hit your toe on its ear and it 
dont mind, but if you hit your 
ankle on its [posterior]then it 
gets furious and spits in your 
eye, said PenPal:
Llama hurdling is only just 
gaining popularity in the States, 
but it is recognized in many 
South American countries as a 
very prestigious pasttime. Its 
audience and participants are of 
similar rank to the polo players 
of England and ^Vales. In fact, 
PenPal says his ridol is Prince 
Mehrabian of Ecuador whose 
record in the llama hurdles has 
gone undefeated for twenty years
 he hurdled three llamas 
standing in a row.
PenPals contenders in 
yesterdays llama hurdles were, 
Jump Realhi, Bolivia, and Leapo 
Verrit, from the CMU track 
team. Verrit said he was ner
vous to try this new event but he 
enjoyed it so much that he is 
trying to get CMU to send hur
dlers with PenPal around the 
world. Hey, Id be willing to 
take a whole year off school to 
leap llamas. The spit isnt too 
bad once you get used to it, and 
Ive already learned not to ankle

the little buggers in the [poste
rior]. The sheer bliss of llama 
leaping is worth all the hard 
work, said Verrit after the races 
yesterday.
PenPal placed first in both the 
400-meter llama hurdles and the 
110-meter high llamas. Realhi 
said, We all knew he would win. 
Hes a pro, whatd you expect? 
But we all tried real hard and 
well get him next year.
About his win PenPal said, I
rknew Id win. Im a pro, whatd 
you expect? Winning the ILA 
title wasnt PenPals goal for the 
races yesterday. I just want to 
evoke some interest in the sport 
here in the States. This stuff is 
even better than soccer, said 
PenPal.
PenPal is on his way to the 
North Pole where hell have to 
contend with ice, and practice 
with reindeer until the llamas 
are aclimated. It doesnt bother
me, said PenPal, and Santa 
said its okay.
The next llama hurdling event 
will be an exhibition meet next 
week at Spit Stadium. It will be 
a chance for the Spit track team 
try it out. If they like it, they 
can order some llamas for next 
years season, said PenPals 
llama coordinator, Llame Ash. 
Ash said, It is more than likely 
that Spit will join the ILA next 
year theyll need llamas.Llama chase brings international competition
By SPACEY GAZE
Natrat Llamas Editor
Competitors from all over the 
world gathered last weekend in 
Gelding Stadium for the Llama 
chase race. This race is the most 
wide-spread llama event. 
Though most llama sports take 
place in South America, the 
llama chase is held in more than 
30 countries according to the 
Llama Sporting Conventions 
1991 Llama League Report. 
Even Scotland has an annual 
llama chase; it is held in 
Edinborough every July. Last

year at Scotlands 
third annual 
llama chase, the 
Queen of En
gland said she 
wishes to partici
pate in the next 
llama chase.
The llama race 
always drew the 
biggest crowd all 
weekend. Spec
tators gathered 
to watch racers 
run after llamas 
which have been 
released from
the gate. The object of the race is 
to catch up to the llama and hop 
on its back.
Said world champion, Belgian 
Ay am Solaim, This event is a 
little humiliating, because you 
chase after a stupid animal that 
usually outruns you. But I have 
been taking steroids for three 
years now; that is how I win. I 
am the only one thats ever 
caught up to the llamas.
To explain why no one else has 
ever finished the race success
fully, Solaim said, No one who 
can really run fast ever partici
pates. The people who partici
pate in this race are usually slow, 
fat, beer-drinkers who think they 
are athletic. It is kind of stupid, 
like bull fighting.
Solaim raced against five other 
competitors in yesterdays race. 
There were two Spit University 
students, two runners from Ja
pan, Soso Jumpa and Jo-So Slo, 
and a runner from Canada, 
Aymused Tomooses. Solaims 
competition was not a worry for 
him.
Solaim rode the llama across 
the finish line ahead of all the 
other llamas. None of the other 
runners caught up.

Secrets of Mehrabians moustache uncovered
ByPOLLYANNA
POTTROAST
Natrat Former Optimist
On of the most mysterious and 
interesting symbols of the CMU 
campus these days is the 
MLehrabian Moustache. Thick 
and bushy, brown and hairy, the 
Mehrabian Moustache has made 
headlines and political cartoons, 
rot a Thistle from the Natrat, 
and was featured on the cover of 
the last Student Onion of this 
pear.
Perhaps the newest legacy of 
Carnegie Mellon  joining the 
bagpipe, the thistle, the Fence 
and Spring Carnival  the 
Moustache stands wide, spread
ing majestically across the face 
>f the Universitys best kept se:ret, our president Robert 
Vlehrabian. Where did the Mous
tache come from? Why is it there? 
fVTien the president drinks the 
nilk from his cereal bowl, do 
eftover cereal flakes get stuck 
n the fur?
To find out, The Natrat went 
;o the man with some of the 
tnswers. No, not Mehrabian 
limself (we couldnt get past his 
secretary and he didnt respond
10 our email), but to his Mous;ache-dresser Franz LaSalle, of 
The Moustache Pamperers on 
SouthCraig.
The president insists the 
Moustache be combed with 
;wenty-three strokes of his 
Vioustache-brush, said LaSalle,
holding up a comb with petite, 
kelly-green bristles. This is my 
job. And once the brushing is 
done, we shampool The presi
dent gets very excited when we 
shampoo. It is all I can do to 
keep from accidentally smear
ing the shampoo up his nose.
The Moustache, pronounced 
moo-staush by LaSalle, is 
shampooed every other day with 
a ginger- and vegetable-based 
lotion, imported from Hawaii. 
On his own moustache, LaSalle 
demonstrated the lather-ability of the soap. Usually the 
president makes mushy-mushy 
noises when I scrub the Mous
tache, LaSalle chuckled, imi
tating Mehrabian. It has be
come quite a delightful tradi
tion for the two of us. All my 
other clients pale in compari
son to the enthusiasm Presi
dent Mehrabian shows, 
LaSalle smiled.
When asked why the presi
dent sports the Moustache, and 
why the Moustache is so valued 
by the president, LaSalle was 
at a loss. So The Natrat went to 
the facilitator of Mehrabians 
Moustache Self-Help Grasup, 
Lydia Cleman-Powell, a social 
worker with a fetish for mous
taches.
Although Cleman-Powell 
doesnt have a moustache of her 
own, she is very familiar with 
the psychological ramifications 
of wearing such an enormous 
fluff of hair on ones face. There
are all sorts of reasons someone 
like Robert [Mehrabian] would 
wear the Moustache. And there 
are also a lot of side effects  all 
of this that I am telling you has 
come up in group meetings, and 
is not supposed to leave the 
room, so to speak, but I trust 
The Natrat for its journalistic 
integrity and ability to keep an 
ethical approach to sensitive 
matters like this.
Cleman-Powell went on to say 
that the presidents Moustache 
has been growing since the presi
dent was seventeen years old, 
and that his deeply-imbedded 
fears of shaving the thing off 
stem from years of harassment 
that plagued the presidents 
early teens.
Puberty struck late, Cle
man-Powell sighed. And even 
though Robert is able to grow facial hair today, he is cons
tantly afraid he will go bald and 
will face ridicule once again. 
Whats amazing to ine, and 
whats very insightful of his own 
personal strength  his mascu
linity is how well he takes the 
attention, both positive and 
negative, hes received due to 
the Moustache.
Journals and papers like The 
Natrat call here all the time askingus questions. The debate and 
speculation spurred by the 
Moustache is neuerending. And 
Robejrt takes it all in stride. I 
think its given him some sense 
of identity. All of us need a way
Pollyanna Pottroast/Natrat Former Optimist
to really time into who we are... 
Roberts way is the Moustache. 
The Natrat speculates that the 
presidents low-profile wave, 
seen when he passes by the few 
individuals he knows, is another 
introspective, self-realization 
exercise Mehrabian uses to get 
to know himself better. And al
though ' the- students at CMU 
constantly suffer from having a 
president more interested in 
getting to know himself than in 
getting to know the students,
CMU as a corporation gains from 
having a president who is con
stantly and healthily aware of 
himself, his goals, and his iden
tity.
Besides Mehrabians tuning 
into himself, the Moustache is 
beginning to serve as role model 
for a new generation of facial 
fashion. Scores of CMU men  
students, faculty, and staff  
are finding truth and comfort in 
their own patches of moustache. 
In fact, the count of moustaches
on campus has exploded since 
Mehrabian took the presidency 
in 1990, according to University 
Planning.
And there appears to be no 
end in sight. Apparently, stu
dents at Spitt U. are catching 
the wave as well, and a few CMU 
students are drawing up a reso
lution to present to Stupid Sen
ate in the fall, demanding that 
the Department of Defense and 
ROTC end their discrimination 
against facial hair.
"Be like Mike...

so they cop out by using those 
evil, sinful, birth-control devices.
Hope that helps. On to our 
next letter...
Dear Steffi:
My fianc recently asked 
me to consider letting him 
ask me to marry him some
time in the future, assuming 
he ever makes enough money 
to get a ring. What do I say in 
answer to this? What do we 
call this relationship, any
way?Confused in Kalamazoo
Dear Confused:
Well, obviously, you say YES!!! 
Fool. If a man asks you to get 
pre-engaged (and that is the 
proper term for such a relation
ship), you jump at the chance, 
since you never know when an
other man is going to be gullible 
enough to fall for you. After all,
youll become rich one day, and 
wholl want you then? Everyone 
will think that you are a butch 
dyke.
By the way * I noticed you 
said assuming he ever makes 
enough money. Does this mean 
that hes an artist? If so, get rid 
of him before he takes any money 
from that sinful group of Pom 
Purveyors (aka the National 
Endowment for the Arts). Ev
eryone knows that these per
verted pigs only exist to siphon 
off the hard-earned dollars of 
fine, morally upstanding Ameri
can taxpayers and give it to 
dykes and fags so they can take 
pictures of their rampant sexual 
habits .... but thats another 
story. Speaking of which[Ed
ited for relevance.]
Dear Steffi:
Only you can help! I went 
to a museum the other day.
My God! Guess what I saw 
there. No, really, guess. 
Thats right. I saw naked 
people. It was horrible. I 
almost fainted right there in 
the middle of the gallery!
The painting was by this 
pig named Season, or Sta
dium, or... or... oh! Cezanne. 
Thats it. My husband just 
reminded me as he walked 
into the kitchen. Please ex
cuse the water stains, but Fm 
doing the dishes while I write 
this. Anyway, what can we 
do, Steffi? People like these 
porn-loving weirdos and 
homer-sexuals are taking 
Gver these here United 
States. What can God-fear
ing, truly patriotic Ameri
cans like ourselves do about 
this? Show me the way, 
Steffi, and (if my husband 
thinks its okay), Ill prob
ably do what you think.
i
Dear Steffi:
My husband thinks that I 
ave the right to a life of my 
wn. He also thinks that I 
shouldnt have to sleep with 
him if I dont want to. You 
know what? He says that 
women are the equals of men, 
and he gets mad at me every 
time I go to cook something. 
He says we should take 
turns!!!
Steffi, you have to help me! 
What do I do about this prob
lem?Pathetic in Pittsburgh
Dear Pathetic:
Well, first you have to realize 
that, yes, its a ba  er, excuse 
me. . First, you have to admit 
that you are pathetic. You, after 
all, are a woman. Fortunately, 
you have crossed this difficult 
first hurdle, and overcome the 
rampant brainwashing of the
unwashed dyke feminists that 
pervade this world, trying to pre
vent the true femininity of moth
erhood. Secondly, you must take 
a stand. When your husband 
tells you to spread em, you 
spread em. Besides, you dont 
have to enjoy it, anyway. Mar
riage is about love, not sex. And 
real women dont have sex, be
cause its immoral. And none of 
those who do have sex are truly 
ready to raise a child, anyway,
Mad-as-hell in Montgomery
Dear Mad:
First of all, I just want to say 
thatyow are my kind of woman. 
That doesnt mean Im a lesbian, 
though, so all you unwashed, 
unshaven freaks can just stay 
away from me.
Secondly, ITS A BAAAABEEEEE!!! *Ahem*
Thirdly, well, you saw what I 
said in my answer to Confused. 
These Porn Merchants must be 
stopped at any cost. Therefore,
I urge you to support concerned 
local politicians, such as the rea
sonable and respected Jesse 
Helms. My good friend Senator 
Helms will surely start a nation
wide manhunt for this Cezanne 
pig, and when he finds him  
well, Cezanne just better start 
praying now.

planet.

ful album filled with ballads 
about our favorite Dunkin Do
nuts?
Jelly Adds to the Roll is 
Kaisers most sensitive song, and 
it will bring tears to listeners 
eyes. Check out these lyrics  
You never understood that my 
taste buds adored more than 
what Hostess offered/ But now 
you know that jelly adds to the 
roll and makes my life worth so 
much more. The sound of jelly 
squirting out of a donut adds to 
the simple tune.
Rub That Frosting All Over 
... the Top of My Donut, is a 
sensual number. It offers us a 
taste of Kaisers wild side  
Baby it can be chocolate, va
nilla, strawberry, chocolate and 
vanilla, or maple/1 just want to 
see you rub it on real thick and 
watch me devour the finished 
product.
The album can be purchased 
with adonutatthe local Dunkin 
Donuts. This is certainly One for 
your collection. Dont miss it.

Wrigleys Extra Sugarfree Bubble Gum: 
Pure chewing satisfaction?
By SPIKE PINTO
Natrat Doddering Staffwriter
Hello. Today I would like to 
review Wrigleys Extra 
Sugarfree Bubble Gum, and at 
the same time see how many 
rules of journalism I can violate 
before my editor turns a bright 
shade of red and keels over back
wards in her chair with an apo
plexy.
A single glance at Wrigleys 
Extra Sugarfree Gum lets you 
know that this is a gum like no 
other. For one thing, you dont 
happen to be chewing any other 
gum. Unless youre one of those 
really disgusting people who 
crams like five or six packages of 
gum into their mouth at once, so 
when they try to speak all you 
see is this huge pink pulsating 
blob that looks like a background 
prop from Aliens.
So unless youre one of those 
fickle chewing gum harlots, 
chances are this is the only gum 
youre eating when you happen 
to be giving the aforementioned 
single glance to the gum, unless 
youre chewing one piece of gum 
and glancing at another. I think 
this is really crude behavior, but 
thats just my opinion. Hey, 
watch me piss off my editor by
inserting arbitrary
paragraph breaks. Anyway, 
so lets glance at the wrapper of 
the gum, since I already chewed 
the piece it contained (and only 
that piece). The first thing I no
tice is that theres this impor
tant medical disclaimer. The 
people at Wrigley are obviously 
really intent that the consumer 
be able to read this, as they used 
the distinctive eye-catching pat
tern of pink on pink. The words 
are: not non-caloric.
Now this strikes me as a bit 
on the Ursula the Sea Witch 
side of the morality scale. Like, 
are they afraid they'll shatter 
some mass delusion that gum 
contains no calories, thereby 
making the industry collapse? 
Anyone with a spoonful of brain 
cells knows that average Ameri
can consumers couldnt care less 
if the crap *they shove in their 
mouths is made of rabbit pellets 
or dehydrated balls of suntan 
lotion, so long as its got enough 
sugar to wipe out a military regi
ment. Then again, Wrigleys gum 
is sugar-free. A-ha! The plot un
folds. 
Furthermore, what is with 
this double negative stuff? I 
mean, if everyone tried to pull 
that kind of stunt, wed have
cigarettes that were not noncarcinogenic, cars that were 
not non-defective, insects that 
were not not not not non-disinclined to stab you with probosci 
and lay their larvae in the nether 
regions of your skin, and worse.
This trend could easily 
threaten the bastions of our 
great civilization, whatever they 
are, and it is thus essential that 
you  yes, you  go out and 
*not* buy some Wrigleys Extra 
Sugarfree Gum, which is prob
ably not not not not nonsugarfree when you wade 
through all the misleading pro
paganda on the label. You will 
have plenty of motivation to not 
not not purchase said gum, be
cause, as I really should have 
mentioned in the first para
graph, it tastes like salty earwax.

Who sustains 
Entropy?
By OREO DUNKIN
Tartan Non-groupie
Contrary to popular belief, 
the people who work at the 
Natrat do have another hobby 
outside of the newspaper. Our 
other interests take us else
where ... Entropy.
Its our main diversion: hell, 
we love to eat. We take our 
food very seriously. For in
stance, Wrong Place Wrong 
Time Bender McWheelie os
tracizes those people who only 
come into the office for the sole 
purpose of eatingthe free pizza 
provided on Sunday nights. 
Most significantly, however, 
anyone who has tried to get 
into our path on a trip to En
tropy, especially on Sunday can 
tell you: Natrat staffmembers 
are in the eating big leagues.
We are the sole sustenance 
for Entropy. We love Doritos, 
Strawberry Quik, Pepperidge 
Farm Cookies, everything 
chocolate ... you name it!!
By the time this issue has 
been produced Entropy will be 
barren. Look on the bright side, 
though: During finals week, 
Hosing provides free donuts.
Need more shit in your life? 
Come to Carnegie Mellon.
We're so full of it, we had to put it on the grass.
