CMDS revises student 
meal plan program
By KEEGAN FOLK
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
There have been many changes in Carnegie Mellon Dining Service (CMDS) since last year, involving new meal plan packages, reorganized dining facilities, and a newly promoted director.The format of the meal plan options and some of the dining facilities are unfamiliar to both returning students and freshmen.Many of these changes have taken place since July 1, when Roger Heydt became director of CMDS. Heydt was previously the associate director of the program. Since he took over the position of director, he has been able to initiate many of the plans for an improved CMDS that had been in the works since last year.At the end of the last fiscal year, CMDS was well into the red. The intention [of the changes] is twofold: to achieve customer satisfaction and to make CMDS financially solvent, said Heydt.The changes include a completely different selection of meal plan packages. Instead of purchasing a set number of meals per week, students now buy Block Meals or an option called Constant Pass. There is also the CampusXpress (Validine) account into which students deposit money to use at any dining facility and other stores on campus. DineXpress accounts can only be used at Dining Service locations.The benefit of the packages over previous years is that there is no use it or lose it policy. This means that if students do not use their entire allotment of meals in one semester, the remaining meals cany over to the next semester. If all meals are not used by the end of a school year, they are credited to a DineXpress account. By the time of graduation, if there are still remaining meals, a student will receive 100 percent of the dollar value of the unused meals. Withdrawal from a meal account prior to graduation returns 85 percent of the value of unused meals.In years past, if the set number of meals per week were not used, they were lost. Also, there are no longer time periods for meals. The cost of this years meal plan packages are roughly equal to last years options.
Another change this year is in the dining facilities. Instead of the cafeteria-style service that was there before, Morewood Court now houses Taco Bell and The Comer Oven. Taco Bell is a smaller version of the familiar Mexican fast food restaurant. The Comer Oven is an expanded version of what formerly was known as MorePizza, featuring various styles of pizza and more variety of toppings than its predecessor. Taco Bell seems to be popular among students so far, but Heydt says it is too soon to say just how successful it will be. Changes in the menu offerings of Kiltie Court and the Highlander have also been made. Heydt says some of these changes came about after working closely with CMU Vegetarians last spring. The facilities are trying to offer not only more meatless dishes, but also more vegan selections, which contain neither meat nor dairy products.Heydt and Dennis Stanhoff, Associate Director of Dining Service want students to know that the major difference between the CMDS of old and the new service is that they will be more responsive to the demands of the student body. Heydt said, The program is constantly improving, but that doesnt mean its always perfect. Were flexible and willing to listen to ideas. Any future alterations in dining services or hours of operation will be made accord- ingto where students are spending themostmoney. Its supply and demand, said Heydt. For the time being, serving hours will remain as they are, as it is too early in the semester to detect any necessary changes. CMDS has supplied comment cards at each of its dining facilities to open the lines of communication with students.By offering the more flexible meal plan packages and some variety of eating facilities, CMDS hopes to please. Are students happy with their dining options? There are approximately 2,300 students on campus with some kind of meal plan. Of this number, about 1,100 are freshmen and are required to have a meal plan.There seems to be a lot of concern over the complexity of the system, especially the DineXpress and CampusXpress options. Many students are not clear on which can be used at what locations. DineXpress can be used at Kiltie Court, HighPlease see CMDS , page 5

Carnegie Mellon University, once again ranking among the top 25 national higher education institutions, moved from 24th to 19th, a jump of five places, according to the annual 
U.S. News and 
World Report survey for 1991.CMU was ranked 19th in the country, with Harvard University ranked number one for the third year running.CMU was ranked 24th in the previous years survey.The U.S. News &
World Report survey utilized statis-  tical information from students and faculty at 1,373 educational institutions. Ranking was also broken down for particular statistics, like faculty student ratio and SAT scores,With an overall score of 89.2, CMU ranked just below Brown University and just above Washington University. Carnegie Mellon had one of the best stu- dent-to-faculty ratios, nine to one, and one of the highest dollar amounts of faculty resources (15th out of all schools surveyed). However, CMU also trailed many of the top schools in certain areas. Graduation rate was a low 69 percent, and freshman
class retention rate was only 86 percent, where figures for schools above CMU were consistently in the high 90s. Despite this, the overall impression of CMUs climb in the rankings has been mostly favorable.Carnegie Mellon President

steps up in the future

Robert Mehrabian expressed great pride when informed of the national magazines findings.Its great that the U. S. News 
and World Report survey verifies what many of Vo havo long known  Carnegie Mellon is among a select group of the very best universities in this country, said Mehrabian, who went on to describe a vision where CMU was of the first rank in all... endeavors.The rankings recognize that our renewed emphasis on undergraduate education is having an impact and it gives us strong momentum to continue
this initiative. One of the values of these types of surveys is to compare your performance in various categories with those of other institutions, especially those in leadership positions.[The Carnegie Mellon administration is] extremely pleased with our move up the rankings list, but by pursuing continuous improvement of our academic programs we expect to make further steps up in the future.Overall ranking for each institution was determined by a complex equation inmmmtmmm volving spending of funds with regard to the number of studonts and instructors and statistics provided by oach university, as woll as by tho American Association of University Pro- fesBors and the Council for Aid to Education.Each school was also further ranked in subdivisions based on guidelines created by the Camegio Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.We hope to continue to build on tho growing reputation of Carnegie Mellon because it is a valuable aBset for our students and for our graduates when they enter the work world, said Mehrabian.

Army ROTC held its annual Activation and Awards Ceremony on the Cathedra] ofLeaminglawn last Thursday. CMU cadets joined cadets from Pitt, Robert Morris, LaRoche, and Chatham for this symbolic and honorary event.The activation portion of the ceremony signified the passing of command from the cadre, those officially in charge of the Army ROTC program, to the cadets who are in their fourth year of ROTC training. These cadets now will fill staff positions until this spring.During the ceremony, cadets were recognized for academic achievement, ROTC honors, Advance Camp performance, and army school completion. CMU students received awards in each of these categories:Jason Lange, ROTC protocol officer and a senior, received the scholar award, ROTC honors, a Superior at Advance Camp award, a silver medal athlete at Advance Camp award, and the Cadet Troop Leader Training award.Jesse Pearson, senior, was recognized for earning ROTC honors, a Superior at Advance Camp award, and a platinum medal athlete at advance camp award. He also was honored as an air assault army school graduate.Another senior from CMU, Robert Yauger was recognized for graduating from Advance Camp and the Cadet Troop Leader Training army school, as well as achieving ROTC honors.David Gault, also a senior, was identified as an Advance Camp

European Community falters economically
BRUSSELS, Sept. 18 (DJ)  Until recently, the European Communitys (EC) progress toward closer union resembled an express train. When a dozen or so countries on the fringes of the EC began moving eagerly to jump aboard, they envisioned monetary stability, closer political integration, and the best hope for peace in Europe, The Wall Street 
Journal reported.Today, those neighbors are watching with growing alarm as the ECs monetary system flies apart, French voters threaten to kill off the crucial Maastricht treaty on European union in Sundays referendum, and the death count climbs in former Yugoslavia.Were very worried, says Crzyszof Popowicz, first secretary at Polands EC mission. Popowiczs biggest worry is that Europe may be heading into a long pe
riod of disarray, in which national interests triumph over neighborliness.We fear that the defeat of Maastricht would reinforce all of the nationalistic forces in Europe... particularly in Germany, Popowicz says.Jacques Attali, president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, goes further. In an article urging the French to approve Maastricht, Attali warned this week that a defeat of the treaty would lead to the tribalization of the continent. In such a situation, we could no longer stop the destructive spiral of division and wars, he wrote.Even if the Maastricht treaty survives, the popular revolt against anything smacking of a European superstate has transformed the outlook for expanding the EC.
In one sense, enlargement may be simplified because if the EC train stalls or creaks ahead slowly, it might be easier for potential members to jump on board. Others could conclude that they will still be able to catch up later and neednt rush.Jan Strasky, the conservative prime minister of the soon-to-be-dissolved federal govemmentofCzechoslovakia, says that a French no vote would be a good thing. In our view, Maastricht goes too far, too fast.The problem is that the fundamental differences among the 12 EC members on how much sovereignty to cede to a central European bureaucracy, and how fast, might divert attention from more peripheral matters such as admitting new members. Such a debate could take years, leaving potential members in
limbo.For many politicians in Eastern and Central Europe, long-term Umbo is a frightening prospect. Hungary, Poland, and Czechoslovakia already are disillusioned with the meager amount of their food, textiles, and steel that has been allowed into EC markets. Nonetheless, the aim of joining the EC within about lOyearshashelped them persuade their citizens to endure austerity in the interest of catching up with EC standards.If a no vote in France snuffs out that beacon, says Gyorgy Granasztoi, Hungarys ambassador to the EC, I think it would be a catastrophe. Granasztoi fears that disarray in the EC would distract it from helping Eastern Europe at a time when economic aid and diplomatic support is urgently needed.For the rich countries that already
have a foot in the EC door  Sweden,' Finland, Austria, and Switzerland  the worries are less urgent but still troubling. Along with the three other mem~ bers of the European Free Trade Association, or EFTA, they have agreed with the EC to form a 19-member European Economic Area, designed to eliminate trade barriers and foster a unified market of 380 million people.The hitch is that the non-EC members in this market must submit to laws and regulations written by the EC members alone. Thats one reason why four of the EFTA countries already have applied, for membership; a fifth, Norway, reT mains divided over whether to apply.The ECs sorry spectacle is adding: confusion to the public debate in both Norway and Switzerland, where anti- EC sentiment also remains strong.

WASHINGTON, Sept. 15 (DJ)Alook at the economic programs put forward by George Bush and Bill Clinton suggests these two cant  or wont add, The Wall Street Journal reported. Even if generous allowances are made for elec- tion-year hyperbole and estimating differences, both programs are promising hundreds of billions of dollars more in tax cuts, spending increases and deficit reduction than their specific proposals will pay for.At a time when discontent with government is already at historic highs, the faulty arithmetic of Bush and Clinton seems certain to heighten voter cynicism. Moreover, neither candidate is giving voters  or the financial markets  grounds to expect real progress in shrinking the nation's $300 billion-plus annual budget deficit, which both agree is hobbling the countrys longterm growth prospects.Theres no question that the issue not being discussed in real detail in this campaign is the size of deficit, and whatitisdoingtotheeconomy, says GOP Sen. Warren Rudman of New Hampshire.Chances for deficit reduction in the next four years rest largely on the hope that the winning candidate will abandon his campaign rhetoric shortly after the election and deal with the problem in his first year in office, when the Presidents power is traditionally greatest.For Bush, who is likely to be squeezed between conservative critics of his 1990 budget deal and a Democratic Congress, such a reversal will be all but impossible. For Clinton, its possible, but not likely.Bushs fiscal rhetoric starts with the insistence thnt he can balance the budget without raising taxes. That alono makes his plan unworkable in the eyes of many budget experts. However, Bush
has added to the likely shortfall by proposing programs that either hack away at tax revenue or increase federal spending.The President has suggested a variety of tax cuts, including a one-percentage-point cut in rates and an increase in the personal exemption, that would cost at least $160 billion over five years. And he has proposed a variety of new spending programs, including a health-care plan costing $100 billion over five years and a job- training program costing $10 billion.All of this would be paid for with spending cuts. In addition, Bush has indicated he would devote a further $300 billion of spending cuts to deficit reduction over the next five years. In all, the White House would have to come up with $570 billion in spending cuts. Yet by his own count, Bush has specified only about $130 billion in cuts.The shortfall: $440 billion, with no indication of where it would come from. The cuts are the largest ever proposed  let alone enacted  in the past. To close the gap, the government would have to hack most politically sensitive programs, such as Medicare and farm benefits by as much as 30 percent.For his part, Clinton starts out with an advantage in this math contest, because he is willing to contemplate tax increases and deeper defense cuts. But its an advantage he quickly squanders. His proposal to raise taxes on the wealthy is eaten up by his tax cut for the middle class. And his plan for $38 billion in additional defense cuts over the next four years only begins to pay for his $220 billion in investments in education, infrastructure, and so on. Clinton fills the gap with an assortment of spending cuts and tax increases, but at least half of those are questionable.

WASHINGTON, Sept. 18 (DJ) Americans believe George Bush to be a finer person than Bill Clinton. But they think Clinton would make the better president.With six weeks left to go in the presidential campaign, a Wall

reason not to re-elect the President are insufficient attention to domestic problems and policies that favor the wealthy over the average person.Bush still fares better than Clinton in a few significant policy areas  most notably foreign policy. By a margin of 65 percent to 16 percent, voters see Bush as better able to handle the issue; by a similar margin, they see him as better able to deal with a crisis on the foreign front.

9/11 INDECENT EXPO
SURE, 4 pm. Campus Police were notified that two female students had been the victims of indecent exposure. The victims were in front of Margaret Morrison Carnegie Hall, and saw a man standing at a second floor window. He dropped his pants and exposed himself to the victims. The offender was described as approximately 30 years of age, 5'7", thin, with curly light brown hair. A check of the building and the area proved negative.
9/11 ASSAULT, 9:45 pm. A female student reported that, while she was walking on Morewood Avenue in front of E- Tower, she was struck on the back of the neck with a peach. The fruit had been thrown from an unknown window in E-Tower. The victim stated that she did not require medical attention.
9/12 MEDICAL ESCORT, 3:48 am. Campus Police responded to a call that there was an intoxicated student with possible alcohol poisoning sitting in the hallway on the fourth floor of Morewood Gardens. The respond
ing officers found the student with his head in a garbage bag. They were advised that the student had had about 32 mixed drinks. He was taken to Presbyterian Hospital.
9/13 ASSAULT, 12:36 am. A female student reported that she and her roommates were aggressively shoved by an unidentified man while dancing in the basement of a fraternity. While laughing, the victim jokingly shoved him back. The man pushed the
victim to the floor, grabbed her by her T-shirt and dragged her up ^jthe stairs, exposing the victims chest. As the victim was dragged, she was called a bitch and a whore. As he reached the top of the stairs, the man was restrained by a brother and told to let her go. The victims injuries consisted of a slightly swollen right little finger and a bruised biceps. She refused medical attention at the time.
9/13 MEDICAL ESCORT, 1:29 am. Campus Police received a call stating that a female student had just injured her head and was in need of medical attention. The responding officers found the victim conscious and alert, but still somewhat groggy. A fraternity brother told the officers that the victim was in the process of climbing on a pool table when she accidentally struck the back of her head on a section of low ceiling. She was unconscious for a brief period and was taken to a first floor couch. The officers were informed that the victim had been drinking, but was not intoxicated. She suffered a golf ball-size lump on the back of her head and was transported to Presbyterian Hospital.
9/13 HAZARD, 2:00 am. Campus Police were notified that person(s) unknown were throwing items from windows on the Forbes Avenue side of Morewood E-Tower. Officers responded, finding what appeared to be a ceramic ashtray, light bulbs, and bottles on the sidewalk in front of E-Tower. It was noted that several residents had removed their
security screens, and therefore, reporting officers were not able to determine from which room the objects were thrown. The area coordinator said that a meeting would take place regarding screen removal.
9/14 POSSIBLE HAZING, 11:20 pm. A Campus Police officer driving on Morewood Avenue between Mudge and Morewood Gardens observed approxi
mately 10 males around a telephone pole across from a fraternity. She also saw water being thrown at that location. As she slowed down, the men ceased what they were doing and ran into the fraternity house. It is a tradition at this house to hang pledges from this pole and throw water on them. This activity was not confirmed.
9/16 MEDICAL CALL, 10:47
pm. Officers responded to a call that a female student, while in her room in Henderson, jumped from her loft to answer the telephone, falling six feet, striking her head on a file cabinet. Paramedics spineboarded and transported the patient to University of Pittsburgh Medical Center .

On July 10, University Presi
dent Mehrabian acted upon the 
recommendation of the Human 
Relations Commission (HRC) to 
change CMUs Statement of As
surance to include a phrase ad
dressing the Department of 
Defenses (DoD) policy on gays, lesbians, and bisexuals in the 
military and the enforcement of this policy in ROTC.
Despite the fact that the Student Handbook states that the 
appropriate committees of Student Senate as well as Student 
Senate as a whole should be 
among those consulted before a 
change to the Handbook is made, 
Mehrabian did not consult Stu
dent Senate or any of its com
mittees before making the change.
Though the Handbook also 
says that Mehrabian may make 
changes without consulting Sen
ate when the University is not 
in session, several members of 
the Executive Committee of Student Senate (ExComm), who 
have the power to act in place of 
Senate, were present on campus 
during the summer, and were 
not consulted. Moreover, even 
since Senate has reconvened, 
there has been no official notifi
cation of the change from 
Mehrabian. Nor has he made an 
official announcement to the 
campus community regarding 
the change.
The change states that on-campus ROTC classes are available 
to all students on CMU regard
less of their sexual orientation, 
despite the governments policy 
which excludes gays, lesbians, 
and bisexuals from military ser
vice.
It is true that Warner Hall 
was under pressure to meet 
printing deadlines for the Stu
dent Handbook and to simulta
neously act on the HRCs rec
ommendation concerning the 
statement. However, Meh
rabian did not notify Student 
Senate, did not attempt to con
tact Senators, and made no effort to publicize the change be
sides its appearance in the Stu
dent Handbook and a small item 
in the 81/2x11 News in mid
summer when few students 
were here to see it. This lack of 
action is reprehensible.
Student Senator Michael 
Tomblyn (MCS) introduced a 
resolution in the September 8 
Senate meeting condemning 
Mehrabians actions with re
gard to the Statement of Assur
ance. We support this resolu
tion and disagree with those 
Senators who believe the lan
guage of the resolution is too harsh.
This issue is serious, and Sen
ate needs to notify Mehrabian 
in no uncertain terms that what 
he has done is unacceptable. 
The administration has an ob
ligation to consult students 
through their representatives 
in Senate before making a 
change in University policy. 
This is especially true in the 
case of the Statement of Assur
ance, which affects every member of the campus community.
Tomblyns resolution is cur
rently in committee, and we 
urge Student Senate to bring it 
back out and pass it as origi
nally written to take a stand on 
the administrations apathy 
toward student concerns.nheHamregp 1maa sePa

Extracurricular activities are 
an important part of the Univer
sity experience. The adminis
tration strongly encourages in
volvement on the part of stu
dents in areas outside the class
room, from participation in stu
dent organizations to attendance 
at the International Festival. 
Accordingly, the University has 
a policy of University Free Time.
Monday through Friday from 
4:30-6:30 pm will be reserved 
for University-wide events  
academic or otherwise. This will be considered open time for 
scheduling events and classes 
will notbe arranged for this time 
(Student Handbook 1992-93, 
page 19). Students have a right 
to a period of time each day free 
of academic commitments so 
that they may participate in 
other aspects of the community, 
or even just take a break from a 
hcctic schedule and eat dinner 
without rushing.
Unfortunately, some adminis
trators, departments, and pro
fessors do not see the impor
tance of University Free Time. 
While classes are not officially 
scheduled between 4:30 and 6:30 
pm, some professors have the 
nasty habit of either changing 
the class time to suit themselves, 
running past the end of classes 
scheduled until 4:20 pm, or 
scheduling exams or review sesLetters to the Editor
Books are bookstores 
primary purpose, not CDs
on
sions in those two hours. The 
impression this leaves on many 
students is that the professor 
either doesnt realize or just 
doesnt care that students have 
activities and responsibilities 
outside the classroom.
Therefore, we feel that the 
importance of University Free 
Time needs to be emphasized 
to all those at CMU, and that 
the policy must be enforced. 
Departments should strongly discourage professors and in
structors from moving class times on a whim. Departments 
and the registrar should refuse 
to assign rooms to be used dur
ing Free Time. Students must 
also do their part. If a professor 
moves a class to Free Time, or 
refuses to acknowledge Univer
sity Free Time, report him or 
her directly to the department 
or the Office of the Registrar. If 
this doesnt help, go to the Of
fice of Student Affairs.
Four or five years spent in a 
classroom or a lab will not produce the kind of graduate for 
which CMU is so famous. Uni
versity Free Time exists in or
der to allow students to become 
well-rounded, intellectually 
and socially active members of 
their communities. For this rea
son, we want to see the Free 
Time policy enforced so all stu
dents can take advantage of it.

A book I needed for the second semester of a two course sequence was marked not in yet on the shelf. I asked the staff at the book desk about this daily throughout the first week of classes. They told me to check back tomorrow afternoon. Finally on Friday I was given an assignment in that class. Since it was the second semester of a two course sequence most of the students already had the book, but a few including myself did not. After accusing the publisher of being slow and the department for ordering late they finally sent someone to look for the book. The publisher was Wiley Scientific, who in my experience has been very prompt with its orders, and the department ordered the book in May. They found the books. Apparently the books had been in for some time and someone had failed to remove the not in yet sticker and bring them out.I dont mind if the Bookstore makes extra money by selling overpriced CDs and miscellaneous other items, but its primary purpose is to provide the students with the textbooks and materials they need for their classes. If the bookstore cannot do this properly then it should seriously reconsider its decision to take on more responsibilities.

our demonstration on your campus. While Chua does not take issue with the fact that the U.S. government funds research at CMU, he questions that such funding is for military purposes. To us, his questioning is a convenient and dangerous departure from the facts. The 
Pittsburgh Business Times article, which we distributed during our demonstration, clearly documented research funding carried on at CMU on behalf of the Department of Defense, the Air Force, the Navy, the Army, and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), totaling over $230 Million. Not only does CMU not deny this fact, but CMU along with Pitt were the sources of the information contained in the article. In fact, a 1971 act of Congress prohibits the Department of Defense from funding research which lacks a direct military application.Statements made at the protest, noting CMUs direct involvement in the development of computerized weapon systems used by American forces in Iraq, were brushed off in the article as mere allegations. This direct involvement is fact documented in The Tartan and in 
Focus Magazine (documentation of CMUs military research can be obtained from us upon request).That a university, an institution of higher education, would be involved in the research and development of several weapon systems, and proudly participate in a war that dropped more bombs in 43 days that we did in ten years in Vietnam, is morally unacceptable. The suffering of the Iraqi people is unseen and continues, with, by UNICEF estimates, over 750 Iraqi children under the age of five dying each day from continued United Nations sanctions. We are obligated to protest with every means available within the realm of non-vio- lence.Furthermore, military research on a college campus has unparalleled seductive power for drawing the young into the base values of modem warfare, as opposed to the higher values of saving and enhancing human life and of caring for our Earth.

Staff member disagrees 
with political columnist
Editor:Last week, R. D. Quinn wrote [Strong ideology needed for presidential elections,9/14]. Unfortunately, he failed to take into account that any"* ideology must be viewed within the context of reality. The general Republican ideology which Quinn finds so valuable has little application in the current presidential election. Under the Bush administration, the government has actually gotten bigger, and this cant be blamed on the Democratic Congress (a cheaj? political shot which Quinn has fallen, for), because Bush has been vetoing corii^ gressional bills left and right, but chose not to veto ones that increased the government size. The only reasonable con- elusions are that the Republican ideol-^ ogy doesnt work (using the past 12 years, 'j as an example), or that Bush doesnt};, represent this Republican ideology.This next presidential election is fa crucial time for those with strong Repub-. ;r lican ideals. The latest Republican plat-*;, form shows that the religious fundamentalists are trying to extend government;' control to force a single restricted set of religious morals upon all U.S. citizens. * This violates the basic Republican tene.t,-, of small government and individual libr,j( erty. Anyone with a strong Republican/'! ideology should vote against Bush thi6 year, to force their party back to its basics principles and away from religious spe-A cial interest groups.While Quinn does a reasonable job of;; explaining Republican ideology, he com^- pletely misrepresents Democratic ideoUt, ogy. The basic Democratic ideology ism that if all citizens have their basic needs.,, met, they will work and consume prod-?... ucts of industry, and this will bring about-- a healthy economy.

Good old Carnegie Mellon. Its not a phrase often seen or heard around here, particularly coming from me, but I have to give credit where credit is due. Just as I was becoming pleasantly bored with the conspicuous absence of controversy (real or imagined) on campus, along came an issue too juicy to ignore. Last weeks Student Senate meeting witnessed a proposal regarding smoking on campus; Senator Josh Knauer issued a plan that, if passed,
would basically ban smoking in dormitories, academic buildings, and dining areas. The penalty for violating the provisions would be a $50 fine and 40 lashes with an organically-grown zucchini.Just kidding about the zucchini, folks. The issue is in fact a serious one that affects everyone in the CMU community. Frankly, when one pauses to consider the compelling scientific evidence that smoking causes more human pain and suffering than H&SSs required computer programming course, the proposed limitations on doing it near others seem like a pretty good idea. Some students, however, question the strict nature of the rules  particularly the ban on smoking in dorm singles and within campus buildings even when nobody present objects to it. Aside from being difficult to enforce in such situations, protesters maintain that these rules have a fascist nature  at least from a smokers point of view.Somehow, I doubt that these same students would support a dioxin-dumping manufacturer that cries foul after being told to clean up its act. Unless Dan Quayles Council on Competitiveness gets involved, such a business would probably have to do something to lessen the environmental impact of its actions. Smokers, as well, must realize their habits deadly effect on the university populations environment and accept stricter  limitations on their behavior. The question  how strict istoo strict?  is at issue, noJ, only for CMU or college cam;-;, puses, but for public and priR';j vate institutions in general.

Rod Serling voice: Imagine if you will: A country where the privacy of ones home is not sacred. Where the government legislates its enforcement arm to listen to your communications without justifiable cause, and mandates that you must build in the ability for it to do so. A nation where the police may seize property allegedly connected with wrongdoing but, when no crime is proven, the property is not returned.This nation does not exist in the fanciful mind of the Twilight 
Zone. It is the United States, and these outrages are all justified in the name of the War on Drugs.Consider the Fourth Amendment. The text of it reads The 
right of the people to he secure in 
their persons, houses, papers and 
effects, against unreasonable 
searches and seizures, shall not 
be violated. This amendment was in direct response to the British soldiers searching and seizing materials from the colonists hqmes. The founding fathers felt it was outrageous that due process was not followed when searching for alleged criminals (rebels), and sought to ensure that
it would never happen again.Yet it is happening again. There are examples of police breaking down doors to search for drugs, often on the weakest of excuses. There are examples of officers who obtain warrants to search for drugs and burst into the premises, and when informed that they are in the wrong place they search anyway, often severely damaging the residents property in the process.This is a clear violation of the Fourth Amendment, yet few people even know of this fundamental right. There are numerous similar incidents, yet no federal or state agency keeps statistics on these violations.And dont think that your communications are safe. Currently before the Congress is a bill endorsed by the FBI and NSA (National Security Agency). The gist of this bill is to mandate that any communications that are encrypted must use a weak method to allow these systems to be monitored for drug deals in the making. It also states that a remote monitoring capability must be built in to the system, with the additional condition that there be no indication to the users of the system that they are being monitored.And this is not limited to electronics systems, but applies to telephone networks as well. It is currently legal for police to listen in to cordless telephone transmissions without a warrant, and this unwarranted monitoringcan be used in court.Not only does this put free speech at risk, where anyone who sends email could be arrested without any due process, but it places American companies at risk as well. With a built-in espioAnd who defines suspicious? The ones doing the searching.Under the current seizure laws, all property of the suspect is forfeit  yet in the vast majority of cases where no guilt is established, said property is not returned.

nage system, how long will it take enterprising foreign companies to break into this system, take advantage of the mandated weak protections, and steal sensitive corporate information? What will happen to American software companies whose programs will not sell overseas because their products are inferior by our governments mandate?What of civil seizures, the best thing to happen to a governmental treasury since the Inquisition? Since all drug crimes are civil, not criminal, no charges need be filed in order to arrest a suspect. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that all that is necessary for the police to search a person is suspicious behavior.
government for the return of his/ her property, and must also meet certain requirements to be eli
gible to sue.Seizures are not limited to the crimes alleged. Consider the recent case in Florida of some Haitian immigrants who were driving to Miami. They had approximately $20,000 in cash which they said they were going to bring to Haiti to help their families. Despite a total lack of evidence pointing towards any drug-related activities, their money was seized and never returned. Their crime? Speeding.Millions of dollars have been generated from these seizures, and this should raise the question: Where does the money go?
For the most part it goes back into the drug war, making it into a self-feeding monster. But there have been cases of law enforcement officials lining their pockets with bribes from dealers, of dealing themselves, and of skimming the profits from the seizures.Recently, the DEA (Drug Enforcement Agency) asked some hardware stores for their sales records of customers who bought indoor plant lights  an effort to catch home-growers. The very fact that they were brazen enough to do so is an indication of how callous the government has become towards our rights. Our own Drug Czar, William Bennett, was quoted on the Larry King show (June 15,1989) as stating Morally, I dont have any trouble with [beheading drug dealers].America is not a piece of silver which can have the impurities beaten out by force. The only thing that makes America the land of the free is our commitment to our ideals and freedoms. When you remove the sacredness of our freedoms, we become comparable to Nazi Germany in our quest to purify ourselves.To paraphrase Benjamin Franklin: Those who value safety 
over liberty deserve neither.

'War on Drugs vital to nations future
odtt,dr oy MgfsfPg
Some people question the wisdom of the War on Drugs, but others go still further and question the wisdom of criminalizing the drug trade in the first place. Before you start believing that decriminalization is a valid policy option, consider its potential effects on the economic health and psychological stability of the country.Our countiy is facinga huge problem in trying to provide work for displaced employees of defense-related industries. We must either create jobs for them and retrain them, or convert their existing jobs to non-military applications. Neither is an easy task.Given this problem, and given the current stagnant economy, would you want to' create another employment mess? We could potentially create several messes by decriminalizing drugs.For inner-city youths in particular, trade in illegal drugs not only provides entry-level employment; it also promises upward mobility and rich rewards for dedicated service. In some areas, youths can join gangs, where they learn about business strategy, money management, and the importance of teamwork. They are continually inspired by the status
and wealth of local drug lords. They are continually challenged by law enforcement officers to do better  to maintain the competitive edge that keeps the best dealers out of jail. The youths also get basic instruction in the use of firearms, because such training is becoming vital to the trade.
that the recent enormous increase in drug- related arrests has led to serious overcrowding in our prisons. Now that we dont have enough prison space, we need to build more.New prisons mean new construction. More prisons mean more guards, more
--- the trade in illegal drugs not only provides 
entry-level employment; it also promises 
upward mobility and rich rewards for dedicated 
service. In some areas, youths can join gangs, 
where they learn about business strategy, 
money management, and the importance of 
teamwork.
If we decriminalize drugs, where will these people turn? Without the enormous potential profits in contraband trade, the whole reason for the drug trades existence will be gone. When these promising jobs go away, where will people find hope?The government really cant afford to spend any money building alternative economic footholds, especially because it hasnt had much success in the past. Businesses might be skeptical about employing former drug dealers, regardless of their obvious business savvy. The illegal drug trade network offers outstanding opportunities. Why take them away?Even those who fail in the drug trade help our economy. Youve certainly read
wardens. Prisons need to buy supplies, and these purchases stimulate the economies of their surrounding areas.If we decriminalize drugs, we wouldnt need new prison space. The U.S. prison system cost $20,296 per prisoner last year, so when we miss the chance to put someone away, were missing the opportunity to put $20,296 to good use. Taxpayers are a lot happier seeing money spent to preserve order than to perform social engineering. When we imprison a drug dealer, we make people feel more secure, and we create jobs.What about drug enforcement agents employed by our government? Theyre trained to storm crack houses, fly drugspottinghelicopters, battle drug lords, and perform all sorts of other action-packed duties. They also have a lot more fun than ordinary law enforcement agents, because they dont have to worry too much about adhering to Constitutional restraints.If we were to decriminalize drugs, what would these people do? Are there enough other crimes, like murders and rapes and thefts, to keep them busy? We certainly dont want to have to create extra work in the crime-solving area. Even assuming that there is enough work, we must still ask if drug-enforcement agents can be retrained without serious consequences. How demoralizing would it be for them to give up commando status and submit to restrictions on search and seizure? Would they become psychologically unstable?We certainly don't need more psychological instability in our country. After all, each of us is constantly fighting latent drug mania. I know that Id be shooting smack and smoking crack and eating hash brownies all the time if I could buy drugs legally. Wouldnt you? If not for stiff laws against drug use, Id be lying in a gutter somewhere, completely wasted out of my mind. I suspect that lots of other people would be, too.The last thing this country needs is more drug-crazed citizens, aimless inner- city dwellers, and unbalanced ex-DEA people. Thats what wed get if we decriminalized drugs. Lets keep the War on Drugs alive. Our nations future depends on it.

Peace process deadlocked in Middle East
Da,sfPsgb Ly SdfPstl
Keeping up with the peace process in the Middle East resembles attempting to stay current on who said what during the presidential campaign. It seems as though statements and predictions contradict themselves every hour. First Israeli negotiators say this, then they say that. Meanwhile, Syrian delegates present us with a picture of satisfaction at the latest deal proposed, but then they caution that it wasnt enough.
When it appeared as though Israel and Syria were about to begin hammering out some type of process for negotiations and peace, Israel suddenly said that it would not withdraw from the Golan Heights until Syria explic
itly stated the type of peace it would exchange for withdrawal. With a loud, unexpected, grind- ingk-thunk, it all stopped. Why?Much of the problem lies with the link between the Golan Heights, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and the Palestinians. Syria plays the part of big brother for the Palestinians, giving them implicit representation when they otherwise would have none. If a separate deal between Israel and Syria, one that did not mention the state of the Palestinians, was struck, Palestinians would be at a severe disadvantage in relation to Israel. At best, they could hope only for partial self-rule instead of an actual homeland.On the other hand, if Syria could maneuver Israel into a position in which they had to enter serious talks with the Palestinians, the PLO could then demand that UN Resolution 242 (the one that says land should be traded for peace) applies to the Gaza
Strip and the West Bank. Pressuring Israel for the return of these territories would present a more attractive option than that of the Golan Heights since they are not important strategic positions. Although the problem of
during the Six Day War. Giving up the territory for a vague peace agreement would leave Israel at a great disadvantage.A definite plan from Syria would also enable Israel to analyze the potential risk involved.
--- a recent survey showed that a 
good portion of Israelis are opposed 
to even a partial return of the Golan 
Heights for peace.
the settlements exists, Israel would be dealing with an issue for which they have already received criticism from the United States and other nations.Of course, Israel has reason to demand a written peace plan from Syria. Syrian artillery used the strategic advantage of the Golan Heights to shell Israeli settlements until they were captured
In order to separate the Palestinian issue from peace negotiations, Israel prefers to deal directly with Syria, as it did with Egypt in 1979. Such an arrangement has several advantages.If some type of peace agreement were reached between Israel and all the Arab states, any tension between one country and Israel could easily spill over into
the others. With separate peace plans, it would be difficult for another Arab country to get involved in a crisis without losing some political advantage. Even though tensions have run high at times, Egypt and Israel have maintained relatively stable relationships.Naturally, dealing directly with Syria allows Israel to handle the Palestinians on terms beneficial to the Israelis. Unfortunately for Israel, several groups are not going to allow this to happen.Four Palestinian groups have already stated that the PLO should oppose any type of agreement concerning the issue of self- rule. In short, they are calling for negotiations that would lead to the return of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank and the establishment of a Palestinian homeland.On the other side of the issue, a recent survey showed that a good portion of Israelis are opposed to

Preserving freedom preserves self-destruction
Continued from PRESERVING, page 6may be, to smoke in private or where others are not affected by the fumes.; This is where the anti-smoking crusade, as well as the proposed policy, goes a bit too far. The fact is, most smokers are fairly reasonable when it comes to keeping the peace in a living arrangement. The majority will likely comply if a roommate objects to smoking indoors, and if he or she doesnt, the crisis can be handled best by an RA. As for a ban on
single-room smoking, I dont see any non-punitive reason for doing this; besides, enforcing it without a separate vice squad division of campus police would prove just about impossible. For these reasons it is probably wisest to leave individuals private areas alone.Since the basic objection to smoking is its secondhand effect on nonsmokers, it seems like the best idea is simply to concentrate on banning smoking altogether in indoor public areas on campus
eliminatingsmokingsections that when they smoke in an en- in dining halls and academic closed space they affect the health

buildings. Even though adopting such a plan would still contain some of the so-called fascist elements of the original proposal, smokers need to recognize
and comfort of everyone around them. Protecting the well-being of their fellow students must, therefore, take precedence over smokers alleged right to smoke
anywhere they please.A compromise like the one I have described will no doubt leave less of their position on the issuo. I would ideally like to see a lot less smoking going on around these parts for reasons that go beyond concern for my own health.For those of us who have lost loved ones to lung cancer or any ofthe many fatal smoking-related diseases, it is downright painful even tosee youngmen and women slowly killing themselves  and it is tempting to try to change
peoples self-destructive behavior in any way we can, regnrdless of the imposition on their individual freedom of choice. Yet in the interest of preserving that freedom, a compromise that protects only nonsmokers lives is, sadly, the best we can do.

U.S. intervention needed in Israel
Continued from U.S., page 7
even a partial return of the Golan Heights for peace. They also feel that current Jewish settlements must remain intact. Given the ; sentiment of settlers in the other occupied territories, complete return of them to the Palestinians seems very unlikely.What, then, is anyone supposed to do? With the situation deadlocked at the time of this writing, what actions are required in order to get things back on track?Israel could agree to partial return of the Golan Heights and discussion ofthe Palestinian issue if Syria agrees to provide hard and
fast ideas for peace. Israel must be very careful to exclude Jordan and Lebanon. They might agree to enter separate serious talks with them at a later date. This situation might allow Israel to develop a somewhat independent agreement with Syria while guaranteeing Syria partial return of the land with the added bonus of the Palestinian issue.Yes, a great many nasty details beg attention. Would discussion of the Palestinians automatically mean serious consideration of the application of U.N. Resolution 242? Would Jewish settlements be allowed to remain? Would peace include embassies, technical
and cultural exchanges, and other such things?This whole situation lacks only one crucial ingredient: Jim Baker and his team. It is indeed a shame that when people on both sides are freely acknowledging that United States intervention offers serious hope, Baker is back here at home trying to win an election for George Bush. Let us all hope that history does not remember Baker as a man who missed the chance of a lifetime.

PRESS PASS
by Paul Platosh
Skaters 
thrash 
campus
Its morning, and in my bleary-eyed sleep daze, I cross Forbes Avenue, nodding vaguely to passersby. Im not really awake, and at this point in the morning I havent quite regained my ability to verbalize yet. Staring dumbly at the cracks in the pavement, I stumble down the sidewalk to Baker Hall.Out of nowhere, my muddy brain detects a strange rumbling noise. Some kind of new Physical Plant torture device? Perhaps its some Robotics experiment gone horribly awry. The truth, however, is less fantastic but equally as intriguing.As the rumbling noise approaches, I hear muffled cries, desperate pleas for help, and abject curses, and as I look over my shoulder, I am confronted by a blazing wheeled demon.He rides his skateboard as if it were an extension of his feet. Wild-eyed, he zigzags amongst the students much like myself trying to get to our first class, clad in fantastic garb, cunningly woven, of a sort I know not what.They can be spotted all around campus, zipping around the sidewalks to class, or just thrashing on the curbs in the Skibo Parking lot. Skaters have formed a sport that evolved into a lifestyle, equipped with its own language. It is a tongue that incorporates a peculiar dialect stemming from the Southern California Surfing Dialect.The skateboard, or stick, has evolved into something more than a necessary aspect of the sport. It has become not only a method of transportation that the skater, affectionately called the skate rat, uses, but also a political billboard upon which the skater may, at his or her discretion, vent political anger in the form of the carefully inscribed slogans and mottos that so often cover the face of the average skateboard.Skateboard art, described by ftiany, including my grandmother, as terrifying, incorporates fantastic dragons, ogres with dripping eyeballs, even going so far as to depict a deranged Santa Claus spreading so much holiday cheer in the form of a double barreled shotgun. With such iconoclastic names as Rob Roscopp and Nash, skateboard art forges new onroads to true cultural enhancement.So what is skateboarding? Is it an art or is it sport? Ask such people as the venerable Natas (look at that one in the mirror) and Bones Brigade, and they will tell you that it most definitely is a sport. I dont know either way, but as the sun sets on our Pittsburgh skyline, Im reminded of a California Kelly quote. Its not who you are, its what you wear. I mean, who really cares who you are, anyway?

Saturday afternoon, the Carnegie Mellon Tartans took the football field ranked first in the UAA, as well as fourth in the nation, and sporting an 11 game winning streak. The University of Rochester team opposed them ranked second in the UAA. After the game Saturday, the two teams switched roles.The Yellowjackets from Rochester had lost the last two years to CMU, after the formation of the UAA. After a tough battle last year, Rochester had a win in mind. After both teams showed little on offense, Rochester put their plays together first, scoring on a 14-yard run near the end of the first quarter, taking a 7-0 lead. The key plays of the drive for the Yellowjackets were two gutsy fourth-down and short yardage conversions.The Yellowj ackets took the lead into the second quarter, where the Tartans decided to shine. The Tartans began throwing a 1-2-3 punch on the ground with sophomore Jason Grusky, and juniors Ed Ruland and Brian Horton. The Tartans drove 35 yards in 10 plays to score the tying touchdown. The key play for the Tartans on the drive was an 11-yard rush by Grusky on fourth down.Sparked by the score, the defense came alive, stuffing two rush attempts by Rochester, and then coming up with an interception. Senior Andy Helms made the interception* for the Tartans,- breaking the school record with 10 to his credit during his career. The Tartans moved the ball on another 35-yard drive, this time coming up with a field goal from senior Fred Harding to take the lead, 10-7 with 5:55 to play in the half. Rochester threatened with less than three minutes to play in the half, but senior Jason Lange blocked a 32-yard field goal attempt, allowing the Tartans to take their three-point lead into the locker room.The third quarter turned into a struggle between sputtering offenses and stingy defenses. Rochester took the ball away on CMLPs only turnover of the game and
turned it into a scoring possession into the fourth quarter, tying the ball game on a 21-yard field goal. CMUs offense, however, continued to sputter and stall. With less than 10 minutes to play in the game, Rochester attempted to kick the go-ahead field goal, but went wide with their 46-yard try. Rochester got the ball again, with good field position, and came away with what would be the game-winning touchdown on a 34-yard run. The extra-point attempt went wide, giving the Yellowjackets a 16-10 advantage.With 1:10 remaining, the Tartans were given a burst of life by what could be considered a poor coaching decision by Rochester. The Yellowjackets, with a six- point lead and less than two minutes in the game, turned the ball over on downs, rather than punting the ball away and burying the Tartans in bad field position. Talcing over from their own 45- yard line, the Tartans offense showed life for the first time since the second quarter. The undefeated sophomore quarterback Chris Dee stiffened and led the team in its final assault. Behind a 21-yard pass to Ruland and a 16-yard run of his own, Dee moved the Tartans to scoring range. But, the Rochester defense tightened their coverage, and stuffed the Tartans attack on the end zone, assuring themselves of a huge UAA victory.The Yellowjackets dominated the game statistically and defensively, holding the Tartans to 200 yards of total offense, while gaining 331 yards of their own. Horton was the Tartans leading rusher with 55 yards, followed closely behind by Grusky, who had 53 yards on the afternoon. The Yellowjackets had two rushers over 100 yards in their 243-yard ground effort. Dee lost his first game as a starter, completing only five of 26 pass attempts for 44 yards.After the game, coach Rich Lackner commented, What can I say? It was a loss. They made a stupid coaching mistake there at the end and almost gave it to us. We had a great effort, but came up a little short.

Volleyball wins eight of last ten games
Mike Harris/Tartan Photographer
Volleyball team In action last week. Saturday, the team played In the 
Washington & Lee Tournament.
By JOSH LINDER
Tartan Sports Editor
The Carnegie Mellon Tartans volleyball team improved its overall record to 10-6 after taking eight of the 10 weekend tournament games. The team members defended their championship title at Washington & Lee (Lexington, Virginia) University's tournament this past weekend.The weekend before last, Carnegie Mellon hosted a round-robin invitational, and captured second place. After losing to the eventual first place Denison College on the Friday night of the tournament, the Tartans had a very strong Saturday, finishing with wins against Marymount College in the morning and the Washington & Jefferson Presidents in the afternoon match.This past Tuesday, the volleyball team was also in action, proving victorious over Geneva College and Bethany College at host Bethany. With the two wins, it improved its record to 64.The Washington & Lee Tournament began with the Tartans losing to the Washington & Lee in two hard fought but disappointing, games on Friday; however, those would be the only two losses that the Tartans would endure, for they defeated the University of the South (Sewanee, Tennessee) in three games immediately following the match
withhostWashington&Lee. The team did not win all of the matches easily; it had to fight back from deficits on more than oneoccasion. Saturdaytumedout to be quite exhausting, with 11 games played in one day. In the day, the team defeated Maryville College in the early morning three games, nearby rival Washington & Jefferson in three games, and Goucher College in three games. The entire 11 games were played with only a one match break between the last two colleges. The hard work payed off, however, for Carnegie Mellon (4-1 in the tournament) made it into the finals, playing 3-2 University of the South in a rematch.The rematch turned out to not be as Successful as the first set of games, for the day had taken its toll on the relatively young team. Grueling match after match took a great deal of energy out of the team, and it ended up sacrificing the two games to the University of the South, 12-15 and 15-17. The games tended to look like the earlier matches, where the Tartans allowed the competitors to gain an early lead, and then came back towards the end. However, South had a stronger finish than it experienced earlier, and ruined CMU's chances of winning the whole toumy. 'Individually, the Tartans looked strong, with senior Lisa Leonardo being named to the AllTournament team for the second straight year. Junior Jennifer New and senior Heather Thompson were both commended for their defensive skills on the court.Looking ahead at this week, the Tartans will be in action at home against Grove City College on Tuesday night at 6 pm. This weekend will prove to be a very strenuous one, with the Tartans travelingto Waltham, Massachusetts to play at host Brandeis' UAA Round Robin Tournament.There will be matches played from Friday through Sunday, with each team playing all of the other six University Athletic Association teams for the best seeding in the championship, which will be held towards the end of October.The Tartans wish to see a lot of support from the campus at all of their home matches, which are played in the gymnasium on the corner of Tech Avenue and Margaret Morrison Street.

The mens cross-country team went to Indiana University of Pennsylvania last Saturday for an invitational. An invitational where they would have to run against Division I and II schools, this was to be a test for the young and injured team.Of the fifteen teams that were there, Carnegie Mellon placed fourth, behind one Division I school, Ohio University, which won the race, and two Division II schools. Butthey managed to beat all the other Division III schools to win the Divisional Championship. Coach Gary Meckley said that the team has not lost a Division III Championship at any invitational meet since1978, and has not lost a dual meet to a Division III school since 1977.Individually, junior Jim Langer finished first among all runners with a time of 26:41 on the 5.2 mile course. Second on the team was Rich Hayes, a senior, who came 18th overall; third was Scott Phillips, a senior, who came 29th overall; fourth was Mike Rea, a freshman, who came 35th; and fifth was Kevin Pogany, a senior who came 53rd. Andy Fletcher and Omar Shareif rounded out the teams top seven.
The team had run only two other races before this invitational. It beat California University of PA, its first meet of the year, as well as winning the alumni meet it held at home last week. But this was the teams first big meet experience where it would confront Division I and II schools which recruit more heavily than Division III schools
and with six runners not running because of injuries, the team had no idea how well they were going to do.Now, while looking in hindsight, a healthy team with all its top runners would have been ablo to finish a close second at tho meet. The team is running better than expected, but because of tho injuries, the team is lacking the
depth that it needs.Next Saturday, the team is headed off to tho Dickinson University invitational. This will allow the team to see how the UAAs will be like, since all the teams in the invitational aro Division III. Tho coach doesnt know if any of tho injured runners will bo able to run by then, but they still have a week to find out.
Soorts Short:
Womens Soccer
The women's soccer team improved immensely in their game on Saturday, although they lost by a margin of 2-0 to a tough University of Chicago. As a team, they improved a great deal, although captain Rachel Bourne feels that there are still holes to fill. The transition from midfield to scoring forward "just wasn't there," and as so, Chicago capitalized on their fewmistakes. The movement towards the ball was more confident, but it wasn't up to the level that they wanted it to be at. Maria Casella, a freshman midfielder, did a tremendous job in the game, filling in the void created by the absence of captain Sonya Chmielnicki and Rachel Weiss. Although they were disappointed by the loss, they feel that they can build on the gains in their new formation andleam from their mistakes. They will next be in action on Tuesday at home against the University of California (Pa.), and on Saturday they will be playing Robert Morris away.

ALLIES promote 
tolerance
By MEGAN DIETZ
Tartan Features Editor
Students and staff have joined this semester to show their support of gay, lesbian, and bisexual people, and the tangible result of their action is ALLIES, a new CMU activist group.However, ALLIES is not a group whose aim is to march up and down the street until someone listens to its demands. It is rather, as Roslyn Hall, an area coordinator for Residence Life and one of the founders of the organization, says, to act more on a one-on- one level. Its really low-key, not a massive thing. Someone wears the button and someone else asks what it means, and they start talking. Thats the idea.The ALLIES button features the symbol of the group, a rainbow- colored triangle with the word ALLIES written above to form a diamond shape. The design is inclusive, says Hall. The colors are a sign of hope, like people coming out of the darkness into the light. The group was formed with several intentions. According to Hall, the idea behind the organization is to be highly visible, but not highly controversial. There are other groups that do that.By wearing the ALLIES button, students also designate themselvos as safe people for others to come to with any concorns they might have regarding gay, lesbian, or bisexual issues. A section in the ALLIES Statement of Purpose reads, to provido access for students to specific individuals and forum for confidential discussion, support, and resource information.The groups membership is primarily heterosexual, but gays, lesbians, and bisexuals are welcome as well. Hall says, Basically, our members are all people who are interested in fighting oppression of gays, lesbians, and bisexuals. The group was formed mostly as a way for heterosoxuals to show their support, but we dont assume heterosexuality. Some of our members are students who dont feel comfortable in cmuOUT or other groups.What kind of students join ALLIES? Students who believe gays, lesbians, and bisexuals have the right to be gay, lesbian, and bisexual without fear of harassment or physical harm, says Hall. ALLIES is a group of members of the dominant culture fighting for the freedoms of the non-dominant culture.... Its a really good feeling to have so much support across the board.Orientation counselors and RAs were introduced to ALLIES in a program during their training. They read statements from famous persons such as k. d. lang and Eleanor Roosevelt regarding gay, lesbian, and bisexual rights, and discussed their ideas on the subject. ALLIES have also made a large effort to reach as many freshmen as possible, and programs with cmuOUT have been planned.Members of ALLIES seem to be pleased with the organization. Katarina Midelfort, a junior chemistry major, says, I joined the group because I was looking for a way to support gays, lesbians, and bisexuals without being discriminated against for standing up.So far, ALLIES has over 100 people doing just that: standing up for the rights of others who they may or may not know. Says Hall, Students have jumped right in and made it happen.
ALLIES meetings are held the first Thursday of every month from 4:30-5:30pm 
in the West Wing TV room, and everyone is encouraged to attend whether they are 
members or not. The discussion for Octobers meeting will center around the topic 
of Homosexuality and the Bible.
Amnesty works 
for human rights
By ANDREW SPROULE
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Think about this  you are thrown in jail, maybe sentenced to death, for speaking out against, or simply disagreeing with your government. But, wait, you saythis is America; that would never happen. Burt Holzman, a sophomore in mechanical engineering, thinks, perhaps, you shouldnt be quite so confident. Even though you cant always see it going on, human rights violations are happening every day in every country around the world  including our own, says Holzman, president oftheCMU chapter of Amnesty International (Amnesty). It is an international group that is, according to Holzman, dedicated to the securing of fundamental human rights for everyone around the world, and putting an end to the death penalty worldwide. Not an unambitious goal, but one that Amnesty believes can be accomplished.Amnesty, which was founded in 1961 by British lawyer Peter Benneson, now has over
500,000 members worldwide. Madeupofpeople from 44 countries around the world, the organization was also awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1977 for its work.Amnesty is often up against some very powerful political groups such as the governments of South Africa, China, Yugoslavia, and the U.S. It would seem the only way one could fight such power would be with comparable force. But Amnesty is a pacifist organization.Letter writing and petitions are used to put pressure on governments or groups to. release, or get a fair trial for, the individual in question, says Holzman. He also says that the CMU group, which reorganized last year after disappearing a few years ago, deals mainly with human rights at CMU and around the Pittsburgh area. In support of Amnestys international goals, the members organize letter-writing and petitioning campaigns in response to Urgent Action Appeals  human rights violations news sent out by Amnesty International that ask for quick response to immediate problems.

SEAC campaigns for Green Vote
By LAURA PALANKER
Tartan Asst. Features Editor
The Student Environmental Action Coalition (SEAC), is more than just an environmental activist group. The Carnegie Mellon chapter is the Western Pennsylvania Coordinating Group and works with groups throughout Pennsylvania, Ohio, and the entire country on environmental issues that range from Campus Green Vote voter registration to lobbying in Washington, D.C.Sophomore environmental studies major Joshua Knauer, who is Western Pennsylvania Coordinator for SEAC, says, We bring students together and give them everything they need to network together and work on environmental problems.Knauers motto for the group is SEAC is anything students make it, and it seems to be true. Various members of the group are working on endangered species, pollution, recycling, and forestry issues. They write letters to members of Congress and file appeals to the National Forestry Service protesting the logging of Allegheny National Forest. They correspond with SEAC chapters in Washington, D.C., who are lobbying for the Endangered Species Act, up for reconsideration
this fall. They write letters to local officials urging improvement in air and water quality in Pittsburgh, and the removal of nearby toxic waste incinerators. They protest the University of Pittsburghs financing of the Mount Graham deforestation project in Arizona  an endangered species habitat and Apache sacred religious ground. SEAC is all volunteers, says Knauer,
and we try to solve environmental problems through education and action.SEACs most recent endeavor, the non-partisan Campus Green Vote, was a great success. Over 200 people have turned in their registration forms, and 200 more forms have been handed out. The event was a double effort: first, to get people out to vote, and second, to get people to vote regard
ing green issues  those that concern the environment. The groups table provided information on the environmental positions of presidential candidates Bush and Clinton as well as U.S. Senate candidates Arlen Specter and Lynn Yeakel.

Abortion issue inspires both sides to act on beliefs
ABORTION, from page LI
AFL and CARR. Their similarits dont lie in their opinions  these are blatantly obvious to anyone who even flips past the News section  but there are much less apparent ways in which they are alike. Both the terms they used and the incidents they described were the same, albeit with much different emphases on what they described as important. Says Livingston, CARR is made up of people from every background.... We have active Catholics; atheists; people who are wealthy, and those not so wealthy; men; everyone.This statement is remarkably like one of Connellys: There are lots of different types of people in the pro-life movement... were not nti-sex, were not anti fill-in-the-blank ... we had an atheist in our group last year.Were not a bunch of radicals, says Livingston. This sentiment is echoed by Sanders in almost the same words: Were not a radical group.So where exactly do the pro-life and pro-choice movements split apart in their beliefs? Essentially, it comes down to the basic question of whether a child is a child from the moment of conception or not. Any pro-lifer will of course tell you yes  and if it is indeed a child, than indeed an abortion is also murder.People say if you have an abortion early in pregnancy, its okay... but if a woman has an abortion anywhere in pregnancy, she doesnt have a baby in nine months, says Sanders. When people talk about the stages of fetus development, they talk about this four-week tage, this eight-week stage  they dont realize that its a continuum of development. Its the in-between stages that count.Whnt any pro-choicer will be quick to point out, however, is the fact that this idea of life from conception has never been proven medi- ally. For every doctor who says that life does begin at conception, there are three more who disagree. This being the case, according to pro-choicers, the issue of abortion becomes no longer a medical one, but a moral one to be decided individually. And since no two people will ever hold the exact same moral beliefs, the pro-choice movement asks  can anyone really considor passing a law that would stuff every persons moral odds and ends into the same mold? This is whore the pro-choice movement comes in.The pro-choice movement is by no means pro-abortion. Says Livingston, If there was ever a bill passed requiring all pregnant girls under the age of fifteen to receive an abortion, wed certainly be out there protesting that. After all, these are your reproductive organsyou decide what to do with them. It is instead exactly what it claims to be, the opportunity to make your own choices. Not only the choice of having an abortion, but the chance to decide your own morals. As Livingston says, When youre pro-choice, you have to let the other people make their own choices as well. Including those people who decide abortion is wrong.

Says Connolly, If you look at the issue with an open mind, avoiding everything youve heard, youre going to come out on the side of whats right.Whats right for you may not beright for someone else. Agreement is not necessary, but understanding is  discussion, exchange, and tolerance  because it is difficult to hate what we understand.

Amnesty works 
for freedom
AMNESTY, from page UOther upcoming projects for CMUsAmnestychapterinclude producing rock concerts on the Cut in support of human rights, showing movies about prisoners of conscience, and setting up write-a-thons for letters and petitions.Amnesty is a non-political group in that it responds only to cases that are from other countries, except when the death penalty is concerned. In this way, the chapters can retain non-political status within their own countries and also keep relatively free from government persecution.In order to remain outside of the political realm, the group
refuses to take sides in cases such as South Africa, where violence occurs on both sides. Amnesty petitions for all violence to stop, no matter who is committing it.I want people to be aware that human rights violations are happening all the time, eveiywhere, whether we realize it or not, says Holzman.Amnestys goal is to alleviate the needless suffering of the victims of these violations, and it is a realistic goal. Holzman says, Governments do pay attention to letters that we write. Every letter counts.

SEAC, from page Li
ing the Campus Green Vote Conference at CMU on September 25 and 26. Sophomore computer science major Maurice Bajcz, outreach coordinator for CMUs SEAC chapter, has been busy contacting colleges and universities in and around Pittsburgh about the conference, inviting both SEAC chapters and other environmental groups. If SEAC goes out andsays, Thisis aproject  we need people to help us, then we get a lot more done, says Bajcz. A lot of groups have the motivation but dont have a direction. The more nationally organized the movement becomes, the more power and strength there will be in it.So why not give them a direction? Last Thursday, the CMU rection as well, SEAC is trying to the environment. mentally conscious, sayschapter (Pittsburghsfirst), spon- work with area elementary Freshman MCS student Houlihan. SEAC is planning to sored the first meeting of a new schools and high schools to hold Christa Houlihan, inreach coor- work with fraternities, sororities, chapter at the University of Pitts- conferences there. Bajcz says, dinator for the group, is working and other campus organizations, burgh. In addition, the group is sponsoring a conference for all of Western Pennsylvania at Chatham College on October 31 on how to form an effective en- vironmental group. Keynote speakers for the event are Gina Collins, National Director of Green Corps, and Representative Tom Murphy (D-Penn), who received the highest rating in  the country from the League of Conservation Voters. Murphy is very concerned with environmental issues, says Knauer.To give young people some diA lot of groups have the motivation but not 
the direction. The more nationally organized 
the movement becomes, the more power 
and strength there will be in it."
L Maurice Bajcz, 
SEAC outreach coordinator
Maybe well have a small general assembly, basically about the importance of the environment and how everything we do affects
with several on-campus factions to improve environmental awareness in a fun way that makes them want to be more environsponsoring different forms of contests to get people involved, says Houlihan.SEAC would also like to collaborate with Recycling Coordinator Barbara Kviz as well as WRCT to get spots for information and discussions on environmental issues on and off campus.Wed also like to make recycling more practical on campus  there need to be more glass and cardboard recycling deposit areas, says Houlihan. We dont recycle plastic, magazines, or newspapers now, either.Even with these endeavors, SEAC still finds time to have fun. Last Saturday they showed 
FernGully, an animated movie about the importance of the worlds rainforests, in the Morewood Reading Room. Trips to recycling plants and national forests are also being planned, as well as camping trips to Allegheny Forest and Ohiopyle.Were encouraging people to enjoy what little wilderness we have around here, says Knauer. Everything that we do is to build a sense of community among people with common goals.

Tim & Jerry: The Battle Begins
By ANDREA FRANCINI
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Remember a few seasons ago when the big battle in television was between Cosby and the Simpsons? Well, now that Bills retired and Bart frolics alone on Thursday nights, the battleground of comedy giants has changed to Wednesdays. NBCs 
Seinfeld faces last seasons favorite new series, ABCs Home Im
provement. If you dont have a VCR, you face a dilemma: Which do I watch at nine oclock and which do I tape to watch later? I am fortunate enough to have a VCR, so I watched the season premieres of both shows, hoping to help those of you without VCRs choose.
Seinfeld began with a mind-bending episode. Okay, follow this  an NBC executive catches Seinfelds stand-up act and asks Jerry to develop a series for himself. After many suggestions from Jerrys friends (I liked Kramers You manage a circus...), Jerry decides to do a series about small pieces of his life. The meetings with the I executives did not go smoothly though. George insists the series must be about nothing and storms out when the executives suggest having a plot. When one of the execs visits Seinfeld at his apartment, Kramer mistakenly drinks long-expired milk and throws up on her. Add a psycho television writer who is stalking Jerry and :Kramer to this mess, and thats the premiere.The strength of Seinfeld is the casts ability to make insignificant or boring things funny and interesting. They continue their quirky humor this year. I do not remember laughing at vomit since the third grade, but when Kramer threw up on the executive, I laughed ; well into the commercial break. Seinfeld can make even vomit, one of the most overused gimmicks, new and funny! This season is especially promising because, in the show, NBC bought Jerrys pilot. I am anxious to see the actors who will play George, Kramer, and Elaine in the series within a series and how these characters of Seinfeld will react to their alternate selves. As usual, some of the best bits of the show are Jerrys short stand-up segments at the beginning, middle, and end of the show. These pieces are a reason to tune in before the opening credits and watch until after the end 'ones.
Last season, Seinfeld was the show to watch on Wednesdays at nuie. Now that Home Improvement occupies the same time slot at ABC, the decision is not so easy. I saw every episode of Home 
unprovement last season and tuned into this seasons opener with high expectations. The show more than lived up to them. Like 
Seinfeld, the plot in this show is minimal. The humor comes from the characters themselves. In this episode, Jill plans a romantic evening for Tim. Not picking up on Jills signals, Tim hangs out at. the bar after work instead of coming home. When Tim finally arrives home, he finds Jill sitting alone in the dark. They fight, realize they have a communication problem, and make up. Before you think this is like thirty something, you must remember that this
is a comedy. When Tim wants to apologize to Jill, he does not sit her down and talk seriously, he shows up at the door dressed as a telephone repairman. Mumbling about crossed signals, he pretends to fix the phone while he makes his apology.
Home Improvement manages to blend the ideas of the mens movement with feminism without having one overpowering the other. Though Jill and Tim have problems, they try to work them out together. They are a very real couple. I dont have three kids, a house, and my own home improvement show, but I can still identify with Jill and Tim. Male/female relationships are difficult to maintain. Home Improvement provides not only entertainment but also education.The fun of Home Improvement is Tims macho show, Tool Time . The joke here is that Tim is almost mechanically incompetent. The real home improvement talent and star of the show is Tims sensitive sidekick, Al. To Tims continued annoyance, most of the fan mail is for Al. These segments always leave me laughing. Tool 
Time even has its own supporting cast, including Lisa, the blonde helper, and the construction crew who often visits the show to share such knowledge as how to cook with tools. Yes, cook. The most important part to watch, however, is the end credits which feature outtakes from the episode.So, were back to where we started. What to watch? As I see it, you can either do some fancy remote control work or watch one show now and switch to the other when re-runs begin. You could even alternate weeks. I must admit that Jerrys whining and Tims masculine cry of AURGH! AURGH! can wear on your nerves. Whatever you do, do not forsake one show for the other. That is the only way you can lose on Wednesdays.

There are so many songs out there that seem to have little significance in society other than their strong ability to provoke a date rape. Songs like Do Me may have a good beat or whatever, but all they do is tell the story of some poor shlep with an overwhelming desire/ need for affection. Then, there are songs like Baby Got Back that choose a part of the female anatomy and go into great detail about how they can violate it. This may seem harmless or even funny, but to me its just gross.Take a look at me / And tell me do you like what you see? / Do you think you can do me?Is this the kind of line that a woman wants to hear?Do men actually believe that women are turned on by being told that they have a big butt? Or that the man is so horny? In all of these songs, there is the same story being told: how these guys sweet-talk some poor woman into solving their hormonal problems. What kind of a person would write a song called Do Me anyway?I, personally, feel sorry for the man who is so lonely that he has to announce it to the world. REAL SORRY.Maybe this behavior isnt all that new. Maybe Adam won over Eve by telling her how homy he was? But, I seriously doubt that.Just this past summer, frwas shopping with my friends and one of them was trying on a bright orange outfit. Someman
who looked like Vanilla Ice came up to her and said, You look just like a big orange. I wanna eat you up. Ah, a poet in the makings. (Now Im waiting to hear someone write a song about that, too.)Dont get me wrong, there is a certain je ne sais quoi about a stranger on the street telling you tha,t you have the face of a Boticelli and the body of a Degas, but an ORANGE?!?How would a man feel if I went up to him and told him that he had a small, tight butt?Or how about ifl just went up to him and grabbed it like I wanted it? Is this an undesirable commentor is this the kind of act that men wait their whole lives for?All I ask is that the next time you hear one of these songs, listen to the words. Women, if you like these songs, Im sorry. Theres no accounting for taste.Men, if you happen to hear one of these tunes, think about this: If you live and die by songs like Babys Got Back and Me So Horny you aint Never Gonna Get it.

In 1989, Cameron Crowe brought to the silver screen Say 
Anything, a film starring John Cusack as Lloyd Dobler, a goofy, yet witty, young kickboxer in love with his high schools resident brain, Diane Court.Crowe added fine touches to a mediocre love story to turn Say 
Anything into a bittersweet romantic comedy. Now Crowe, the man responsible for adapting 
Fast Times at Ridgemont High for film, is at it again with a more adult comedy set in Seattle with the grunge scene as a backdrop. Instead of dealing with new high school graduates, Crowe picks two twenty- something couples contemplating their existence as individuals as a part of a monogamous relationship.Janet Livermore, played by Bridget Fonda, is a cashier at a coffee shop whose ambition is to finish architecture school. Her romantic aspirations are not so high. She is totally, and completely fixated on Matt Dillons Cliff Pincier, the clueless lead singer of a local band, Citizen Dick. She overlooks all his shortcomings and continues to insist that they are soulmates.Cliff Pincier seems to care less that she is even there. Cliff is. preoccupied with his band, Citizen Dick, whose members are played by Pearl Jams Jeff Ament, Stone Gossard, and Eddie Vedder. Although Cliff is working four jobs, he is confident that Citizen Dick who is
huge in Belgium, is destined  for rock greatness.Janet and Cliff live in an apartment complex with several other aimless single people in single units. One of them is a young professional Steve Dunne (Campbell Scott) who has finally found true love with an overly cautious environmentalist Linda Powell, played by Kyra Sedgwick. They inch closer and closer to commitment only to be pulled apart by Linda, who dumps Steve, a man who has brought her into the mysterious waters of adult love, to reconcile with the ever present Andy, Mr. Sensitive Ponytailed Man.Crowe did a fine job with the witty dialogue, almost too fine. His script has characters delivering perfect one-liners that people in real life think of after their conversations with the people they want to impress is over. The writing seems almost forced.Crowe made sure that everything that comes out of his characters mouths was perfectly cool. Fortunately, Crowe chose the perfect actors to carry his dialogue in the most unpretentious, honest fashion. Fonda, Dillon, Sedgwick, and Scott all portray their characters in such a way that makes you feel like they are all your friends and they live in the same apartment complex.Crowe also did a good job finding a city to film inSeattle. At the time of filming, the grunge scene was not as high profile and visible as it is today.
Bridget Fonda and Matt Dillon affectionately search for true love.
Soundgarden and Alice in Chains have cameos as themselves, as well as ex-Seattle Super Sonics player Xavier McDaniel, My Own Private 
Idaho director Gus Van Sant, 
thirty somethings Peter Horton, and the founder of Sub Pop label, Bruce Pavitt. Tim Burton, director of Batman and Edward 
Scissorhands, has the funniest
cameo as a cheesy maker of dating service videos. Crowe also made sure to get the best of the grunge scene on the best soundtrack since 1990s Pump Up 
the Volume.The one error Crowe made concerning the music is the repeated playing Paul Westerbergs annoying upbeat Waiting for Somebody to fill in the empty audio
gaps. As a whole Camerons second effort as a director went more smoothly than his first effort, Say 
Anything.Crowe showed that his experience with Rolling Stone magazine pays off in the world of cinema by providing the Seattle music scene as a backdrop. The movie is hysterical and uncannily on target when it comes to

post-teen angst. Go and see this movie and bring a pen and pad to write the classic one-liners like, Are my breasts too small for you? and I live my life like a French movie. Catch this witty movie to get some good dialogue and get a good look at Matt Dillons wig. It looks like it fell off the head of Pearl Jams Eddie Vedder.

Kronos Quartet surprises audiences with energy
r.By KRISTIN BEVERIDGE
Tartan Staff writer
If your CD player and music collection are getting to be old news, you may want to check out the Pittsburgh music scene as an alternative. A concert can be a ...refreshing experience after hours ...and hours of listening to a recording while youre locked up in your room or car, and it also can give ypu a chance to focus your atten- _ j/ion on the musicians themselves. .. This past weekend for example,
the Kronos Quartet played at the Fulton Theater in downtown Pittsburgh as part of the Pittsburgh International Music Festival. For those of you who are avid fans of new classical and ensemble music, you missed a great one!Kronos is a contemporary group that got together about 12 years ago and since then has remained on the cutting edge of new music. Most of the pieces the group plays are commissioned by composers from around the world, which give it the international style for which it is so well-known. The quartet consists of two violinists, a violist and a cellist, all of whom are dedicated to challenging and ex
perimenting with ways of musical expression. Their most recentre- cording, Pieces 
of Africa, features works by African composers.On Friday evening,Kronos played pieces from its various collections which included works original ing in Sudan, China, Russia, the Republic of Georgia, and the United States. The piece entitled, Song, written
by Zhou Long, one'of Chinas most influential contemporary composers, had its World Premiere. In addition, Steven Mackey, an American composer and electric guitarist, accompanied Kronos on his piece, Physical Property. Although each one was beautifully played, the most profound and interesting piece done by the quartet was about social awareness  Bob Ostertags All the Rage. It incorporated a taped monologue dealing with the issues of AIDS and gay rights, leaving a lasting and powerful impression upon anyone who was there.The Kronos Quartet is an intriguing group to see in concert because ofits energetic stage pres
ence, sense of style and personality. At the end of the concert, it did an unexpected performance of Jimmy Hendrixs Foxy Lady which indeed took the audience by surprise. Of course, the musicians added numerous twists of their own.There is definitely something to be said for actually seeing musicians such as these and the passion they have for their music and instruments when they play live. It is something a stereo just cant help you experience.Each week there are new concerts and events happening in and around Pittsburgh that just might give you a new perspective on what music really is, so check out the area.
THE MOVEMENT breaks int

Well, theres one group from LA who decided to do thisTHE MOVEMENT. Theyve'just had their first hit single, Jump ; with this type of hipno music.; THE MOVEMENT began when "keyboardist AJ Mora, rapper/DJ Hazze, . and drummer Humpty Visson found each other on the dance scene. They combined their best qualities and pro-duced their fresh sound which can be found in record stores almost every- ; where.THE MOVEMENT doesnt use the  take one underlying beat and create a .song around it approach with their style

The pulsating beats change  the beat works you into a frenzy and then slows you down.Their style is a product of what theyve learned from the LA raves.As group member Humpty Visson explained in a recent Arista, press release:LA was the first city to really break techno in the U.S., to really break rave, and THE MOVEMENT comes from this culture.The rave scene is the culture we come from. What a lot of people dont know is that in the raves in LA, they usually have three different rooms.Theres the reggae room, the hip hop room and then the main one is techno.

The 400 Blows
Film buffs will surely pay attention to Akira Kurosawas opinion, especially his opinion on a new 
director. Kurosawa says, The 400 Blows is one of 
the most beautiful films that I have ever seen.
Directed by Franois Truffaut and starring Jean- Pierre Leaud, Patrick Auffay, Claire Maurier, and 
Albert Remy, The 400 Blows tracks the life of a Parisian youth who turns to a life of small-time 
crime as a reaction to his uncaring parents.Powerful, tender, and overwhelmingly sad, this 
film touches your heart without leaving you feeling 
exploited. Catch this 1959 black and white film, if 
you feel up to reading subtitles or understand French.
At 6, 8,10.

Waynes World
Have you ever been walking across the Cut, 
mindingyour own business, when you noticed people bowing toward each other while crying out, Were 
not worthy! Were not worthy! Thats the Waynes World influence.
Waynes World is the first really stupid and com
pletely tongue-in-cheek movie since Bill and Teds 
Excellent Adventure to infiltrate pop culture and 
language. If you havent seen it yet, youre missing 
out, not to mention that you arent getting a lot of the 
jokes being made around you.
Mike Myers ( Wayne) and Dana Carvey (his twisted 
sidekick, Garth) from Saturday Night Live get to
gether and expand their popular SNL skit to feature length. You wouldnt think it would work; but it 
does. Wayne and Garth take on an evil television producer played by Rob Lowe in order to keep their 
public access show. Excellent. Party. Bonus. Definitely worth the dollar. Party on, Wayne, and party 
on, Garth.

Medicine Man
This movie is about a doctor, Campbell played by 
Sean Connery, who is in the middle of the Amazon. 
He finds the cure to cancer, but cannot seem to 
locate the exact ingredient which will save mankind from this dreadful disease. So, another doctor is 
sent to assist him; surprisingly, especially to Sean, 
it is a woman,Dr. Rae Crane, portrayed by Lorraine 
Bracco. Bracco exhibited a slightly annoying perfor
mance, yet the casting director used a very realistic 
looking doctor, as opposed to the beautiful doctors 
on General Hospital.
At first the two do not get along but end up 
realizing that they need one another. The only thing 
missing in this stereotypical plot was a scene where 
Drs. Crane and Campbell fall in love. Experimenta
tion continues, and the plot becomes exciting when 
the land is about to be destroyed. The ironic part is 
that the last ingredient for the cure is discovered 
when the Amazon is burned into nothing. Both 
doctors continue for their search for the ants which are the key to the cure.
Go see this movie, it just might be worth your time.
At 6, 8,10,12.

Angry Red Planet
Im beginning to think that someone in AB has a thing for the year 1959. Angry Red Planet is the 
third film in two weeks that is from 1959. Its 
directed by lb Melchior and stars Gerald Mohr, 
Nora Hayden, Les Tremayne, Jack Kruschen, and Paul Hahn.
As you might have deduced from the title, this 
film is about an expedition to Mars. Predictably, the 
expedition runs into all sorts of terrifying aliens. 
The most interesting of these creatures is a large 
mouse/spider hybrid.Yes, the special effects are 
cheesy, but what do you expect from 1959?
Angry Red Planet, filmed in Cinemagic process, 
is an entertaining film despite its slow progression to the action.
At 6, 7:30, 9,10:30.

What does a comedian who tears off his own limbs, brandishes kniveB, abuses audiences and puppets, drinks drano, and eats razor blades call himself? Amazing.The Amazing Johnathan, a veteran of Late Night with 
David Letterman, Evening at 
the Improv, MTV, and Comic 
Strip Live (17 times), among others, will be performing Friday, September 25 at Carnegie Mellon Universitys Skibo Ballroom.The Detroit native, who has opened for the likes of Robin Williams and Monty Python, started his career doing magic shows for children.He gave up magic for comedy when even the children saw through his tricks and didnt return to it until friends abandoned him in California and he was forced to perform for food. Johnathan, who describes his magic as so bad it was comedy, honed his skills on the
street comers of San Francisco.Johnathan learned from those disastrous early magic shows, I stepped on a dove once. He escaped and was trying to run away. I was chasing it, trying to catch it, and it stopped. The kids were really upset.... I put it in a paper bag and wiggled it around; I told them look, its still alive.... Then I thought, I could do this every day.J ohnathans wacky, devious, violent, and silly act frequently got the young street performer arrested for creating a public disturbance.Of course, being an accomplished magician, Johnathan easily escaped his captors handcuffs to continue the show. Handcuffs are the easiest thing in the world to get out of ... theres a way to do it without even picking the lock. Hes philosophical about his police record, It looks great in the press kit 15 years later. Johnathans act is fast-paced, in-your-face schtick with a menacing twist. He describes himself as a low-budget Penn & Teller commenting, I loved
them until I met them.... I liked Teller, but the big guy never shuts up.His act relies on the macabre and unexpected to keep the audience riveted. The unpredictable comic keeps his routine fresh by using audience volunteers as living props in his breakneck stream of physical gags and one-liners.[The volunteer] is more or less a ventriloquists dummy.... [No matter what I do] he's not gonna cry  hes gotta look cool, he laughs, but I get burned on a few of these things too.Sometimes things get out of hand, says Johnathan, whose volunteers have thrown punches and pulled guns on stage.But it would take more than a mere handgun to fluster the Amazing Johnathan, who has been known to soak persistent hecklers with high-pressure soda water. After 20 years of doing this, its really rare that someone surprises me, he says.In a time when it has become commonplace to refer to comics ascrazy or off-the-wall, Johnathans psychotic intensity stands out. After 45 minutes with the calculated insanity of his disciCourtesy of AB CoffeeHoiJse

plined and deranged humor, youll be relieved that he has found himself a safe outlet.But the act is not just a safety valve for Johnathan  it also helps him pickup women, Power in the hands of the Evil Boy! Tell them Im psychicwhen I come into town, Ill get laid. Despite his amazing moniker, Johnathan is unattached. Im single and psychic.Opening for Johnathan is comedian Richie Byrne, headliner out of New York City. Catch Johnathans performance at 9 pm, Friday, September 25 in Skibo Ballroom. Admission will be $2 with student I.D. and $7 for the general public.
