Im very pleased, especially 
having worked with and sat on 
[the Funding and Recognition 
Committee], said Director of 
Student Activities Anne 
Witchner. We can give out monies 
based on what groups asked for in 
the past and allow for new orga

a positive effect.
Im very relieved that it 
passed, said Student Senate

Last years referendum failed 
by a 26-vote margin, and many 
thought this years would meet 
with a similar fate.
Im surprised that it wasnt

irner Hall two weeks ago with the re-encoding 
all student, faculty, and staff IDs.
Anyone who has tried to use a Carnegie Mellon 
card around campus for the past 11 days has 
en scrutinized, examined, or asked to produce a 
:ond form of identification. Students wishing to 
tain entrance to residence halls, use the Validine 
item, or get materials from University libraries 
ve all felt the effects of the theft.
We hope to have the problem fixed soon; if not 
Thanksgiving, then certainly by the end of the

siness Affairs Pat Keating. The immediate 
nedies will buy back the integrity of our sysns, and allow us to get the campus back up and

According to Keating, several meetings were 
id immediately after the theft about how to deal 
th the problem. The decision was made to relidate and re-encode all the current student,

ichine, a new school code replaces the old, and 
all IDs produced on the old machine will be

Controversy surrounding Thursdays 
trial in GSIAs management game course 
centered on trial issues which would 
affect the academic standing of the stu
dents involved.
The management game course, re
quired for all GSIA masters students, is 
designed to provide students with expe
rience in a setting that simulates real 
life. Students are divided into teams 
that act as the management for firms 
competing in the detergent industry.
A firm competes against firms within
its own nation; the 39 game firms, eaclt 
with 5-7 students, are divided into 13 
nations. Students gain experience 
through game decision-making. Decisions 
range from labor negotiations with real 
union representatives to finance, mar
keting, and production decisions used as 
input for a computer market simulation.
Thursdays trial was based on a grand 
jury indictment of a firm in Nation 2. 
Firm 3 and Philip Elbaz, its president' 
were charged with attempted joint and 
collusive monopolization.
At the root of the controversy were 
conversations that Elbaz initiated witti.

Bush risks Congresss ire on gulf war
 WASHINGTON (AP)  If President Bush 
starts a war to drive Iraq out of Kuwait in the 
next two months, he could risk battling both 
Saddam Hussein and Congress.
Congress adjourned for the year without 
receiving any assurance the administration 
will request a declaration of war, or other
wise seek lawmakers consent, before order
ing military action.
^Consequently, congressional leaders set a 
special procedure for reconvening Congress 
in-an emergency and established a special 
group of 18 senior lawmakers they say should 
be consulted while Congress is out. 
^Administration aides say they dont want 
to recognize that group because that would 
Agadto a process of deciding national security 
|seues by committee.
'^Administration aides say Bush and his 
prides plan informal consultations with se
lected lawmakers. Bush discussed the issue 
with congressional leaders yesterday, but 
lawmakers said no understanding was 
reached.
There is obviously a difference of opinion 
in terms of whether that power to start 
hostilities rests with the executive branch 
or the congressional branch, said Sen. Wil
liam Cohen (R-Maine).
The result is uncertainty about how the 
tgyo branches of government will cooperate if 
jjje U.S. began a war. That uncertainty gives 
the administration a freer hand now, but it 
also raises the risk of opposition from Con
gress if the administration began hostilities.
Its universally agreed that U.S. forces can 
defend themselves and neednt wait for con
sultations with Congress if theyre attacked, 
fhe question is what role Congress should 
play if Bush wants to order an attack on Iraqi 
forces in response to a lesser provocation or to 
enforce United Nations resolutions ordering 
Iraq to get out of Kuwait.
I know of no understandings that have 
been reached about the role Congress will 
play, says Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana, a
There is obviously a difference of opinion in terms 
of whether that power [to start hostilities] rests 
with the executive branch or the congressional 
branch. 
 Senator William Cohen (R.-Maine)
leading Republican voice in Congress on for
eign policy. My impression is very clearly 
that the administration does not want a fullscale debate on the declaration of war prior to 
anything occurring.
But Congress has signaled it doesnt in
tend to be forgotten. Only the Congress can 
declare war, says Senate Majority Leader 
George Mitchell (D-Maine). The president 
has no legal authority to commit us to war. 
It was Mitchell who arranged the adjourn
ment resolution allowing Senate and House 
leaders to bring lawmakers back to town.
Administration officials assert that law
makers are less interested in deciding 
whether to go to war than their public state
ments imply. In part, lawmakers are trying 
to protect their institutional rights, officials 
say. Whatever the case, past U.S. military 
actions suggest the president has wide leeway 
to act without congressional approval.
The Constitution makes Congress the body 
that decides whether U.S. armed forces enter 
a fight. It states that the Congress shall 
have power... to declare war. The president 
isnt granted explicit war-making power.
The Constitution also makes the president 
commander-in-chief of the Army and Navy. 
Recent presidents have used that position to 
push the U.S. into hostilities without a con
gressional declaration of war. The Vietnam 
War was fought without such a declaration. 
Last year, Bush ordered the invasion of 
Panama while Congress was in recess.
Legal details may be less important for
President Bush than a desire to avoid offend
ing the lawmakers whose support he would 
need in any hostilities. Thus he could face a 
decision: whether to consult Congress before 
going to war or to bring lawmakers in after 
making the fact.
In the meantime, a fourth U.S. aircraft 
carrier battle group has arrived in the Middle 
East, the Pentagon said.
The carrier Midway with its six accompany
ing ships, is now stationed in the North Ara
bian Sea, said spokesman Bob Hall.
He declined to say if it is a possible replace
ment for the carrier Independence, although 
reports from San Diego say the Independence 
is due home by Christmas.
Meanwhile, Hall also reported the Iraqis 
have increased artillery deployment in the 
Kuwait-Saudi border area. At the same time, 
he said, armored personnel carrier strength 
has declined by 300 from the reported 2,500.
Hall had no theory as to the new figures, but 
he said that the Iraqi forces still appeared to 
be in defensive positions.
He also reported that Defense Secretary 
Dick Cheney had relented in his determina
tion to recommend a veto of the Military 
Construction Appropriations bill.
Earlier, Cheney reportedly planned to rec
ommend a veto to President Bush because 
there was no funding for a new airbase in 
Crotone, Italy for a fighter-wing being forced 
out of Spain. But, Hall said, the bill now 
merely calls for a rvaluation of the need for 
the base, rather than a complete rejection.
Bush may wait to sign 
budget until election eve
WASHINGTON (DJ)Fresh 
in the minds of voters going into 
their election booths next Tues
day is likely to be the image of 
President Bush signing the 
budget bill that raises U.S. taxes 
by some $137 billion over five 
years.
Thats because the president 
is likely to wait until election 
eve on Monday before signing 
the budget into law, according 
to a White House staffer. The 
massive document, rumored to 
be 1,500 pages, was received at 
the White House on Wednesday 
after relatively speedy work by 
congressional staffers who put 
together the final formal text
only after lawmakers adjourned 
last Saturday.
Technically, Bush could wait 
until November 12 to sign tfie 
legislation that has tarnished 
the presidents popularity and 
the integrity of the adminis
tration while deeply dividing1 
the Republican party. But, utifortunately for Bush, he miiS'ti 
initial the legislation by midnight Monday in order to avoid 
a default by government since: 
the current debt limit expires 
at that time along with a shortterm continuing resolution* 
which funded the governinejlj; 
since Congress adjourned l$a 
weekend.
War in Guif could lead to 
explosive price inflation
WASHINGTON (AP)  The 
price of oil could easily explode 
to $100 a barrel if war breaks out 
in the Persian Gulf, a panel of 
experts told a Senate committee.
Theres no limit, said John 
Lichtblau, chairman of the Petro
leum Industry Research Founda
tion. It depends on how much 
panic there is.
The day war starts prices will 
explode, said Lichtblau, one of 
several oil industry experts to ap
pear before a Senate Governmen
tal Affairs Committee hearing.
Senator Joseph Lieberman (DConn) presiding over the hearing, 
echoed growing concern in Con
gress about what will happen at 
the pump if war breaks out.
Oil prices hovering in the $3! 
a-barrel range could easily tripl 
said Professor Fariborz G] 
of George Washingto; 
Universitys business school*.
I would not be surprised-^o 
prices reached $100 a barrel,

price of $100 a barrel would nrea 
gasoline would cost nearly .'$3'

WASHINGTON (DJ)  Student 
..loans held by the savings-and-loan 
.'bailout agency will continue to he 
federally guaranteed even though 
they technically lost their eligibility 
for such insurance.
The Resolution Trust Corporation 
and the Education Department 
agreed that the department will 
provide buyers of the loans with 
"reinsurance guarantees. The guar"antees will apply to the studentloans 
held by insolvent S&Ls under con
trol of the bailout agency. Some loans 
became ineligible forgovemmentinsurance because of mismanagement 
by the thrifts or other disruptions.
The Education Department said 
that the cost of providing reinsurance 
for the loans would be significantly 
less than losses suffered by the 
bailout agency if it couldnt sell the 
loans or had to offer them at a steep 
discount. The RTC currently holds 
about $500 million of the student 
loans.
Polls show that Republicans are winning the 
battle for the minds of todays younger voters
KINGSTON, R.I. (AP) Polls consis
tently have shown that young voters 
between 18 and 24 are markedly more 
Republican than the rest of the country.
There is a uniqueness in the 20-yearolds of today that had been attributed to 
the baby boomers, says Warren Miller, 
an Arizona State University political sci
entist who is culling through mounds of 
voting data. Its not the baby boomers 
that are different, its the next genera
tion.
One example is the race for the Rhode 
Island open congressional seats. The 
Democrat, a state senator named John 
Reed, is a 40-year-old West Point and 
Harvard Law graduate who is stressing 
economic issues in his campaign. Young 
people are looking for opportunities and 
jobs, he says. These were Democratic 
issues that we lost. We have to get them 
back.
The Republican, Trudy Coxe, has a 
campaign manager who is 23, a scheduler 
who is 21, an office manager who is 22, a
volunteer director who is 21 and a 
fundraiser who is 23. Her appeal to 
younger voters reflects what she has 
learned from her young staff.
I cant believe how different I am at 41 
from the people at 21 I deal with in my 
campaign, says Coxe, former executive 
director of Save the Bay, a non-profit 
activist group. Theyre much more 
worried about how money is spent. 
Theyre cautious and careful.
As a result, Coxe is emphasizing a 
message of traditional Republican thrift 
above her own environmentalist back
ground. Weve got to promote this idea 
of fiscal responsibility, she says. We 
have to be practical. Thats what appeals 
to them.
Her campaign manager, Steven 
Winoker, thinks that young people do 
want change; its just that to them, that 
means working for Republicans. George 
Bush and Ronald Reagan still represent 
change, he says. We dont have a Re
publican legacy of strong failure, only a
legacy of strength.
This encomium masks some dangers 
for Republicans, however. They worry 
that the Bush administration, with its 
waffles on tax issues andits negotiations 
with Democratic leaders, has endangered 
its natural advantage with these voters.
Even young activists like Winoker ac
knowledge that their affinity with the 
GOP could be only temporary. Its abso
lutely not inconceivable at all, the Re
publican campaign manager says, that 
he could work for a Democrat someday.
As a result, these younger voters  
living with the Republicans but not 
married to them  have emerged as a 
critical swing bloc in American politics. 
The challenge for the Republican Party 
is to seal their allegiance. The challenge 
for the Democrats is to woo them away.
But this battle is being conducted in an 
atmosphere of astonishing political in
difference  and ignorance.
The other day, a reporter joined four 
students in a discussion circle. Not one
could identify his member of Congress 
One said that Jesse Jackson had beei 
Michael Dukakis running mate in 1088 
Another argued that George Bush ha 
run as Governor Dukakiss vice pres 
dential candidate.
Younger people stay away from jhi 
polls in droves. The National Electioi 
Survey shows that 58 percent of regis 
tered voters under 24 didnt vote in tti 
1988 election, nearly twice the rate 
non-voting in the general public.
But once these young people do become 
voters, will they retain their Republicai 
leanings?
That question has spawned a lively 
debate among political professic 
These people are extraordinarily 
engaged politically, so their identification 
has very little depth, says Geoffrey 
Garin, a Democratic pollster. They are 
essentially pre-political and their atti
tudes are not very strongly formed. They 
are Republicans, yes, but they could very 
easily move.
Cuban spy attempts to defect to U.S.
; NEW YORK (DJ)  Juan Manuel 
Rodriguez Camejo is the spy who came in 
from the tropics. And got thrown right out 
again.
;! Washington, which normally welcomes 
buban defectors with open arms, wants 
nothing to do with Rodriguez Camejo, a 
puban counterintelligence officer who has 
fried to defect to the U.S. twice in the past 
fcwo weeks. The problem, it seems, is that 
.Rodriguez Camejo, who says he holds the 
rank of major and has 21 years of experi
ence as a Cuban spy, was just too good at 
his job: thwartingthe Central Intelligence 
Agencys espionage efforts in Cuba.
For years, says Rodriguez Camejo, he 
was a double agent who penetrated deep 
y/ithin the CIAs Cuban networks. The 
p.S., it appears, fears that Rodriguez 
Camejo may still be up to his old tricks.
I Ive surrendered my weapon to those 
who were my enemies for many years, 
insists Rodriguez Camejo, sounding des
perate in a telephone interview from a 
Mexican hiding place late last week. Im
flying a white flag.
White flag or no, FBI and other intelli
gence agents last week interrogated 
Rodriguez Camejo for hours in California, 
and, he says, promised him asylum. But 
after more interrogation, the agents 
changed their tune. Instead of getting a 
new identity in the U.S., Rodriguez Camejo 
was handed over to Immigration and 
Naturalization Service agents. The INS 
men notified him he was a danger to U.S. 
security and told him, his wife and their 
daughter to take a hike  back to Mexico.
Terrified that Havana, which has warm 
relations with Mexico, would send Cuban 
agents to kidnap or assassinate him, 
Rodriguez Camejo tried again on Monday 
night to defect. With his wife and daugh
ter, he again crossed the border but was 
caught by INS agents in San Ysidro, Cali
fornia, where he is now in detention.
Rodriguez Camejo says his unfriendly 
reception is all CIA sour grapes. After the 
CIA recruited him in 1979, he says, he was 
one of the officers who helped run a Cuban
counterintelligence operation that placed 
27 double agents in the CIAs network of 
Cuban agents.
By the time the Cuban connection was 
exposed in Havana in 1987, 90 percent of 
the CIAs Cuban networks turned out to be 
double agents working for the Cuban in
telligence service known as the DGI. The 
U.S. was embarrassed by the disclosure, 
made after a Cuban agent defected in 
Czechoslovakia. As well, the Cuban pen
etration showed that the double agents 
had devised a way to beat U.S. lie-detector 
machines.
Now Rodriguez Camejo says the CIA 
has it in for him because of his role in that 
episode.
Not quite, says a high-ranking U.S. 
government official. There isnt much 
sympathy for defecting agents who have 
betrayed the U.S. But, he adds, the gov
ernment has denied Rodriguez Camejo 
political asylum because it doesnt trust 
him. It believes he may still be a double 
agent.
Another U.S. official cautions that 
Rodriguez Camejos claims about his 
record, his background as well as his mo
tives are suspect.
But a former U.S. intelligence officer 
says the fact that Rodriguez Camejo 
brought his family with him at a time 
when Cuba is falling apart, makes hjs 
seem a bona fide defection. The former 
officer says the U.S. is being immensely 
stupid in its treatment of Rodriguez 
Camejo. I would think it would be worth 
the risk to the U.S. government to really 
find out what he has to say.
Rodriguez Camejo says he was just do
ing his job when he infiltrated the CIA. I 
was an officer in counterintelligence, de
fending my countrys sovereignty, fight
ing the CIA within Cuba, he says. But 
now he has called it quits, convinced by the 
collapse of communism in Eastern Europe 
that the ideology he defended for many 
years is bankrupt. He also says the Cuban 
intelligence service is after him for his 
involvement in an anti-Castro conspiracy.

the presidents of the two other firms in 
Ration 2. Elbaz said the purpose of the 
iialogue was to establish a trade asso
ciation within Nation 2. Member nations 
would share market research data  for 
which firms must pay in the game  via 
^e^ssociation. Firms would receive 
hree times as much market research 
lata without incre asing their costs. Elbaz 
aid the association would be modeled 
ifter associations that actually exist and 
voyld not violate any anti-trust laws, 
mSTwould only have been formed with 
he approval of all firms and the course 
nstructor, Valerie Wiedman.
Presidents of the other two firms disigree on the nature of Elbaz offer. We 
jelieyed that collusion was, in fact, taking 
>lace in our nation, stated Jennifer 
Kaj]es, president of Firm 2, in a memo 
iddr.essed to the GSIA community. 
Michael Fraley, president of Firm 1, 
Istified that when he was approached, 
|fc proposed the formation of a leritimate trade association that would 
lave the approval of the course instructor. 
The outcome of the Thursday night
 held in Porter Hall 100 with
attorneys acting as legal counsel and 
judge, and undergraduate students act
ing as jury  was inconclusive because 
the jury was unable to attain the 
unanimous vote required to either acquit 
or convict the defendants. GSIA Associ
ate Dean Ilker Baybars told The Tartan 
late Friday that the case will not be 
prosecuted any further.
Students involved, however, dont nec
essarily agree that this case is closed. 
From what [Prosecutor Thomas] Kerr 
said to me, said Elbaz, I got the im
pression that at least one faculty mem
ber wanted me out of school.
Confusion centered on whether or not 
the charges in the trial were also the 
subject of a GSIA disciplinary probe.
There was never any discussion of 
academic action, said Wiedman, the 
instructor for the course. There has been 
no investigation.
Though Kerr, the prosecutor, told The 
Tartan that such action would not be 
my affair at all, several students in
volved in the case seemed to think that 
Kerr was involved in such an probe.
Balles, the Firm 2 president who first 
went to Wiedman and later to Kerr with
Theyve got what they wanted.
 Lee Turrini,
____ Firm 3 vice president
concerns that collusion may have been 
taking place in the game, explained her 
goals to the GSIA community in a memo. 
I felt it was my responsibility to protect 
my team from unfair competition, the 
memo stated. I hoped that the results of 
these conversations would be a serious 
dialogue... in which any ideas of collusion, 
if indeed present, would be dropped.
I must tell you that I am disturbed 
considerably by your proposed solutions 
to the suspected collusion in our nation, 
stated a letter Balles team sent to Kerr 
after their meeting with him.
[We] will not cooperate with the Gov
ernment in this case for the purpose of 
punishing students outside the context 
of the Game, it stated. By this we mean: 
(1) Expulsion (2) Receiving a D in the 
Management Game course.
Elbaz said that when he was informed 
of the Game investigation, Kerr sug
gested that he reread the student hand
book section on cheating and plagia
rism.
But GSIA officials stand by their as
sertion that there was no disciplinary 
probe involved.
There has never been any academic 
or disciplinary action, said Baybars. 
There has been no investigation from 
my office and no such investigation will 
be undertaken.
Elbaz and other members of his team 
felt that the matter was handled poorly. 
A more thorough investigation wouldnt 
have let this come to trial, said Scott 
Detillo, Firm 3s vice president for fi
nance. It was obvious from the trial 
that neither [Kerr nor Wiedman] had 
done their homework.
There was a level of professionalism 
that we expected to see but did not see, 
said Elbaz. The level of professionalism
associated with this game is out of line.. 
with what weve come to expect in GSIA. 
Team members are concerned about 
the publicity that they say GSIA intend 
tionally directed to the trial and the* 
issues surrounding it. Both Elbaz arid^; 
Detillo said that they want the GSIA; 
administration to write a letter to thg; 
GSIA community stating that they" 
dropped the charges and explaining theij. 
reasons. They also said that they hopeC 
such a letter would receive equal distri
bution as the pre-trial publicity.
Lee Turrini, vice president for Finance 
of Firm 3, doesnt think that the firmis-' 
record will ever be cleared in this issue 
since there will not be another trial.11 
The only way theyd really get it out that 
were innocent, he said, is to retry thei 
case. \J
Both Turrini and Elbaz agreed tha& 
the administration didnt want to retry'* 
the case because, as they see it, the 
administration achieved its goal.
If they wanted to prove that ethics ar-er 
important and that cheating is not to be; 
tolerated, said Elbaz, theyve done iti - 
Theyve got what they wanted, said 
Turrini. s

Carnegie Mellon considers 
Polish candidates for ECE 1
The Electrical and Computer Engineering Department has 
signed an agreement with the Electronics Department of the 
Technical University of Warsaw to consider top Polish students1" 
applications for the ECE Ph.D program.
Stephen Director, head of ECE, said, We will evaluate them 
by the same standards we use to evaluate other candidates. The 
only difference is the application fee, which will be waived for the 
Polish applicants.
The Technical University of Warsaw will choose their best *" 
students and send those students applications to Carnegie * *
Mellon. The students are expected to return to Poland when they 
complete their education.
According to Director, this will formalize what has been an 3 
informal relationship we have had for a long time. Some current 
members of the ECE faculty have taught at the Technical Uni:';; 
versity of Warsaw or graduated from there. Visiting professors * 1 
from Warsaw are also working here.
Carnegie Mellon is accepting applications until January 15- "

cannot be unpeeled or moved once 
theyre in place.
The re-encoding process will not 
be" mandatory, but anyone who 
wants to take advantage of cam
pus'1 services will have to go 
throiigh it. Campus services that 
would be affected include 
V&idine, all card readers, cashing 
checks at the Cashiers office, and 
borrowing materials from the li
brary and clusters.
One of our real worries was 
soili eone gettinginto the residence 
halls and committing an assault 
or theft, Keating said. That 
problem took precedence over 
others.
The chances of the thieves find
ing and using a Validine account 
is small, according to Keating. 
About2,000 of our 7,000 students 
use Validine. So theres a 2 in 7 
chance of someone randomly en
tering a students Validine ac
count and using it. Neverthe
less, said Keating, the University 
would like to eliminate that 
chance, as well.
In terms of other IDs, theres 
not much you can do with a staff 
ID, Keating said. Usingthe gym, 
the library, and the computer, 
store are about it. We dont think 
that will be a problem.
On th e possibility of the thieves 
gaining entrance to sensitive ar
eas, Keating indicated that ev
eryone had been notified imme
diately and that precautionary 
measures are being taken.
The decision to forgo issuing all 
new IDs was an easy one, said 
Keating. It doesnt buy us any 
more security than what were 
going to do. Right now, the idea is 
to reinstall the integrity in the 
system.
However, according to Keating, 
the lessons of the theft may lead 
to changes in the ID cards in the 
future, though. A committee has 
been looking at new ID card 
possibilties. Changes may include 
serial numbers on the cards 
themselves and pictures taken
It was a knowledgeable theft.... They 
took it all.

vice president for Business Affairs
that can be scanned into a com
puter, among other options.
That would happen next fall at 
the earliest, he said.
The theft, which has inconve
nienced almost every member of 
the Carnegie Mellon campus 
community, occurred Wednesday 
night, October 24. There was not 
a forced entry, said Keating. Ei
ther the thieves had a key, or a 
door had been inadvertently left 
unlocked. However, he indicated 
that the latter possibility was less 
likely.
There are only two keys to [the 
ID] room, said Keating. They 
are now in a safe in the cashiers 
office. There are several master 
keys, as well.
He said that the master key$ 
were held by several of the unj. 
versity vice presidents, custodial 
staff, and a few others.
It was a knowledgeable theft,", 
said Keating. They took it ali.' 
The thieves escaped with blank 
forms, the photo equipment, a die 
cutter, the laminator, and tj^ 
encoder.
We think that the machines 
are probably being used to make 
fake drivers licenses right now, 
said Keating. Theres not too 
much you can do with a college 
student ID.
A decision has not yet been made i 
as to where ID re-encoding \yjji 
take place.

kjrs, and theyll be able to control the 
hool. That doesnt seem right, but there 
[oesnt seem to be a lot we can do about 
~tffe just have to try to make people 
jore aware of whats going on.
People have strong feelings on the 
utrject, said Witchner. Some dont fully 
efeve we have enough money, while 
thers believe we have enough and arent 
nahaging it well. A lot of people do care 
lieway or the other.
Junior chemical engineering major 
fee Petrich, a member of Carnegie
Mellons Baseball Club, said, Obviously, 
if were going to get more money, were 
happy about the vote. Most of the 
funding for the Baseball Club comes 
from the Activities Fee.
Hopefully, the raise will allow [the 
Baseball Club] to get some extra equip
ment and not do so much fund-raising, 
Petrich said.
According to senior computer engi
neering major John Heinlein, The 
Computer Club has supported the raise 
in the past  weve supported anything 
that brings more money to student orga
nizations. Heinlein, the Computer Club 
president, also said, we could have gotten 
by with less money, but we wouldnt 
have gotten anything accomplished this 
year.
Heinlein went on to say that the 
Computer Club may ask for more money 
for capital investments they couldnt 
make this year. Its very conceivable 
that we wont get it, though," he said.
I think the increase is good, provided 
that what has happened in the past 
doesnt happen again, said third-year 
architecture student Kevin Settembrino,
because promises that were made [in 
terms of funding] never came through.
Most people on campus wont feel the 
full benefit of $50 because there are too 
many special interest groups, said se
nior chemical engineering major Julian 
Bentley.
The Fee increase is not finalized yet; 
the plan will go before the Board of Trust
ees at their November 12 meeting. If 
approved, the increase will go on the next 
tuition bill.
Neighbor doesnt anticipate much 
trouble getting Trustee approval, though.
They have voted for Fee increases in thp 
past, he said, and hopefully theyll crapi,,. 
tinue to do so. I just hope theyve read up, 
on the fiscal problems weve been having.,',
We just have to take it one step at.a. 
time, said Witchner.
However, Witchner emphasized th^t, 
the money isnt the full answer to the,, 
problem. It will make a difference, shg,, 
said, but, even more than before, it wilj,,. 
require that the Funding and Recogni
tion Committee, Senate, and organizan, 
tions pay even closer attention to how., 
the money is spent.Construction continues

currently in the process of in
stalling a waterproof membrane 
to prevent any further damage.
Work on Morewood Gardens is 
roughly 40 percent complete, ac
cording to Stephen Saulis, direc
tor of the Physical Plant.
Future projects of the Physical 
Plant include replacing windows 
in Doherty and Hamerschlag Hall 
(which is actually a structural 
issue in many buildings) and re
pairing many of the sidewalks on 
campus. Mechanical equipment 
is another high priority. The 
Physical Plant would like to in
sure people comfort as well as 
energy efficiency.
Every year the Physical Plant 
is forced to prioritize several 
multi-million dollar projects.
We need to look at where the

project relates to other campus 
projects, said Saulis.

FORUM
How to turn a democracy into 
an oligopoly\ in one easy step
 Last week, the student body 
 voted to raise the Activities Fee 
to $50 per semester, and we ap
plaud it for a job well done. The 
fee will help keep organizations 
such as The Thistle and 
crew,alive  and it will 
strengthen the resources of the 
Activities Board, the Student 
Union, and many other student 
programs.
But never mind that we like 
the referendums results. Last 
Weeks vote pointed out  once 
again  a distressing fact: The 
campus completely failed to 
represent itself.
Whats really important is that 
out of the 6,000 people eligible to 
Vote on the referendum, only 598 
voted  one in ten. Thats horri
bly irresponsible  and we as 
students need to change our roles 
' as members the community..
Much, if not most, of the stu
dent body passed by the voting 
..table in front of Doherty Hall. 
We, the students, knew about 
the vote. Most of us blew it off. 
And that sets a dangerous pre
cedent.
312 people voted for the refer
endum, and 286 voted against it. 
When the numbers are this 
Small, the campus allows itself 
. to be at the mercy of a few special 
interest groups. It could have 
been either AB or the Greek 
community  or any other mi
nority  making our decisions 
for us.
Thats not democracy  its 
the tyranny of a small number of 
people. Sound like an oligopoly? 
it should.
-Tomorrow, all of us, regardless 
of whether or not we voted on the 
Activities Fee, will have the op
portunity to vote again. This 
time, its for senators and gover
nors, leaders and policy makers.
. Its important to the nation, and
to us.
But if follow the pattern of last 
weeks vote, we will fail completely 
to represent ourselves yet again.
If you think your representa
tive has done an admirable job for 
the budget and youd like to see 
him or her continue, you should 
go vote for him or her. Or if your 
senator slept through the S&L 
debacle and youre mad, you 
should go vote him or her out.
Americas system of democracy 
is based on a pretty simple set of 
rules, and for those of us whove 
forgotten, lets review: We the 
people must be active and in
formed. We must go vote, and we 
must understand what or who 
were voting for.
The vast majority of us can vote. 
But thats not a just right, not 
something to do when weve 
caught up on our homework and 
our sleep  its a responsibility. 
As citizens of the United States, 
its our obligation to get out of 
bed, go down to the voting booth, 
and check the names of the people 
who should represent us in the 
government.
But thats not all. Its important 
to study who or what were voting 
for. Putting checks next to ran
dom names is irresponsible  
maybe even more irresponsible 
than not voting.
If we dont go out and vote re
sponsibly now, then we shouldnt 
complain about what errors our 
representatives make later on. We 
will have made a larger error by 
not doing our part at the ballot 
box.
As Americans, we all must take 
a stand. Otherwise, it might be 
the Teamsters or the tobacco lobby 
or some other small group that 
determines how the country does 
its business.
Its scary. And its not demo
cratic.
Chill out, for cripes sake
You look around the computer 
cluster you have been sitting in 
.for thirty-three hours and see 
the same twenty-five faces, 
though somewhat more drawn, 
sitting exactly where they were 
when you started.
You pick up the paintbrush and 
put one more, or was that one too 
many, strokes on you final port
folio piece. You have nineteen 
hours to finish.
Sound familiar? It should. Its 
that time of the year again. No 
more coasting; mid-semester 
grades have come, and the exams 
and projects that will determine 
; your semester QPA are under
way. It is time for work to get 
serious.
And with increased work comes 
| increased stress.
At Carnegie Mellon, stress is a 
given part of life. Face ityoure 
here, and the stress isnt going to 
! go away at least until after finals. 
But you are not alone in feeling 
frustrated and exhausted, and 
you are not powerless.
. Weve all heard it before, but a 
refresher course in stress-relievirig every now and then cant 
hurt. Many groups and activi
ties on campus are there to help 
students get through stressful 
periods more easily. Along with 
! the wealth of anxiety, there are

Letter to 
the Editor
Editor:
If you dont say No 
to New Taxes you wont 
have time to do your 
homework.
Youll be working 8 
hours a day to meet all your increased 
living costs. As a charter member of 
Citizens Against Government Waste, I 
have learned that cutting Government 
Waste is the answer to eliminating the 
deficit, not raising taxes.
The comptroller General, who works 
for Congress, issued a report that there 
are 180 billion dollars being wasted by 
Congress, and Congress has the guts to 
demand new taxes. Congress has not 
eliminated even one of their wasteful 
programs.
Any new taxes will go down the sink 
hole of government waste. Taxes have
already risen 111 % in the last eight years 
while Federal Spending has increased 
122%. Every tax increase has led to an 
increase in the National Deficit.
Congress will not work to solve our 
nations problems; they are the problem. 
The entrenched permanent Congress is 
more concerned with being re-elected 
than with working intelligently to solve 
our problems. Congress has the guts to 
vote themselves a 39% pay increase that 
is costing American taxpayers 
$13,000,000 per year.
Jane Brady is running for U.S. Senate 
from Delaware on a platform of Govern
ment Reform. We need more Congress
men and Senators to do the same. Jane 
will turn down the extra salary if elected. 
Jane pledges to serve for only two terms, 
and she wont send out unsolicited mass 
mailing at the expense of taxpayers,
which now costs taxpayers hundreds of 
millions of dollars. Jane says special 
interest groups have too much influence 
in Congress, so she refuses to accept any 
contribution from Political Action Com
mittees.
These same Political Action Commit
tees and Congress permitted, and in some 
cases actually abetted, Savings and Loan 
rip-offs. They will now cost every Ameri
can family an estimated extra $30 per 
month for the next 30 years. The scoun
drels who have stuck us with this bill 
arent even being prosecuted.
One half ofthe failed S&Ls were in the 
State of Texas, where Congressman Jim

Regulators when they warned the

Anti-rape signs are a good reminder
some opportunities and strate
gies to take that can offset the 
stress. The University offers just 
as many outlets for fun and relax
ation as it does for stress  its 
just a matter of knowing where to 
turn.
Athletics, tutoring, AB movies 
and other events, and even Phipps 
Conservatory are all good ways to 
blow off some steam, and getting 
eight consecutive hours of sleep 
can do wonders, too.
If these activities dont take a 
load off your shoulders, just tak
ing some time out to talk to some
one  another student, your RA, 
or someone at the Counseling 
Center  can help you clear your 
mind.
But dont take it too far the 
other way. Too much frivolity now 
will only mean that much more 
stress later, when youre bogged 
down with all the work you put off 
to avoid being too stressed in the 
first place.
You may think that you dont 
have the time to waste on extra
curricular endeavors. But if youre 
crunching for a longtime, chances 
are that the few hours you spend 
mentally and physically recharg
ing yourself away from the clus
ter or the library will pay off in 
the end in the form of increased 
productivity.

sponse to Alex Ogilvies 
letter entitled Anti- Letter to 
Rape Painting Angers the Editor 
Frats [10/29],
Although I was not involved in the 
sign-painting, I would like to explain a 
few things to you and those who also hold 
your opinions.
First of all, I do not believe that these 
signs were intended to educate the 
fraternities; nor were they intended to 
accuse all fraternity members of being 
rapists. I think they were designed as a 
reminder to all those who frequent fra
ternities that no woman, no matter how 
she is dressed, how much she has had to 
drink, what her reputation, should be 
forced to participate in sexual activity. 
Acquaintance rape is defined by the Cen
ter for Victims of Violent Crime as using 
physical force, emotional bargaining, 
blackmail, or mind games to force a 
woman to have sexual intercourse. This 
also applies as a definition for sexual 
assault when actual intercourse does not 
occur.
As for the so-called virtues of fraternal 
organizations, whether national or on 
this campus, and their attempts to stop 
sexual assault: I myself have been sexu
ally assaulted twice on this campus, once 
by a pledge at DU (and I am certain this 
would have been a rape if I had not 
managed to get away), and once by a 
brother at Pika. I have friends who have 
been raped at ATO and Beta.
I have talked to women and heard 
their stories of humiliation, degradation 
and assault by members of virtually ev
ery fraternity on this campus. This, again,
does not mean that every frat member is 
a would-be rapist; it is just to say that 
rape and assault happen frequently in 
fraternities on this campus and goes 
virtually ignored.
Apparently, Pittsburgh Action Against 
Rape gets approximately four 
month from women who have been raped 
at Carnegie Mellon fraternities. This says 
nothing of all the attacks that go com
pletely unreported.
Those anti-rape signs, as far as I c 
tell, were designed to raise the con
sciousness of everyone on this campus, 
not just fraternity members. Specifically 
among the fraternities, there is i 
eral objectification of women that is re
volting. All the proof you need is in the 
posters, t-shirts, and comments that come 
out of these institutions: Phi Kaps tPlease see DATE RAPE,

Letter to 
the Editor
Editor:
The longer Im at 
CMU, the more I hear 
about the counseling 
center. And it isnt good 
news that I have been 
hearing. My freshman year I didnt even 
know that it existed until they were 
represented at a meeting I attended. 
There I heard them say that they treat 
many more faculty than students be
cause, students just dont come for help. 
I couldnt believe their lack of self promo
tion to the one commodity that is paying 
their salaries, the students.
At a point in my CMU career I could 
have really used a professional helper, 
but when I inquired to my friend who 
had said they had gone I was told horror 
stories about how the counseling center 
had treated suicide, eating disorders, 
stress, and roommate conflicts. There
fore, I did not seek the use of my 6 free 
sessions.
Overall, I have found this CMU orga
nization to be very lax, uncaring, and
unresponsive to the students needs on 
campus. This doesnt mean that I dont 
urge you to get help if you are struggling 
with a problem. There are many great 
organizations outside of CMU, many o! 
them free, which may be more suited to 
your needs. But right now I could not 
honestly promote the Carnegie Mellon 
Counseling Center as a caring  
healthy choice to help you cope with 
problems.

Bush claims that he 
wont let the boys down
Michael J. Ewedosh
And we will not let them down.
Those are the words a group of 
Rochester, Minnesota, Republi
cans read from the lips of the 
president as his Washington 
spokesperson told reporters that 
he would take his Thanksgiving 
meal with troops in the Persian 
Gulf.
And we will not lei them down.
These are not easy times,"Bush 
told them. But I have never been 
more proud of all the young men 
and young women  all volun
teers, highly motivated, beauti
fully trained, who are serving 
halfway around the worldthan 
I am today.
And we will not let them down.
The them Bush speaks of are 
the group of 210,000 men and 
women  many of them about as 
old as you and I. They will soon 
increase in number to 310,000. 
The U.S. contingent  already 
the largest deployment abroad 
since Vietnam  will soon grow 
to more than three-fourths of the 
multinational force in the Gulf.
And we will not let them down.
They will pass the Thanksgiv
ing holiday entrenched in the 
Saudi Arabian desert or aboard 
ships lingering in the Gulf, half
way around the world from any
one who gives a damn. Their holi
day meal will feature turkey that 
looks a lot like something the 
Highlander might serve on a notso-bad day. They might even catch
glimpse of the President as he 
makes his way from unit to unit, 
ship to ship. Then again, they 
might not see him at all.
And we will not let them down.
Theyve been there since Au
gust: When Saddam Husseins 
tanks rolled onto the streets of 
Kuwait, American planes rolled 
off runways in the U.S. and at 
bases around the world. Those 
planes started a procession of 
American men, women, and sup
plies that hasnt yet ended and 
that may not end for quite some 
time. Western leaders hope that 
this procession will contain the 
Iraqi military and its leader, de
picted by Bush as worse-thanHitler, within Iraqi borders.
And we will not let them down.
Nervous anticipation has given 
way to boredom for some of them. 
Bush rattles swords one day and 
the world braces for war, but on 
the next day, he reminds us that 
he is waiting for sanctions to work. 
Meanwhile, the costs of keeping 
such a large force in a state of 
battle readiness continues to be 
paid for with American lives: there 
have been 43 non-combat fatali
ties in Operation Desert Shield, 
and more are sure to come.
And we will not let them down.
Sooner or later, Bush will have 
to decide .what hes going to do if 
Hussein doesnt pull his troops 
out of Kuwait. Hes said that 
neither he nor the American 
people will accept anything short 
of complete withdrawal.
If Bush has evidence that 
Hussein is paying any heed to his 
remarks, hes not sharing it with 
anyone. Reports coming from the 
Gulf indicate that Hussein is still 
strengthening his positions. Dia
logue between Hussein and the 
president is nothing but a battle 
for public opinion.
And we will not let them down.
The president is using words 
like these to belay fears that they 
are in another Vietnam. Theyre 
not; the president is not commit
ting them to battles that the 
American people dont want to 
fight. As time passes, though, 
people will begin to ignore the

daily rhetorical exchange between 
the president and Hussein, and 
begin to forget just why we sent 
troops into the Gulf. If and when 
the exchange of words becomes 
an exchange of bulletsor worse 
 with those troops acting as 
intermediaries, the American 
people wont remember or care 
why they were sent there. When 
they come home in flag-draped 
caskets  their brothers and sis
ters, mothers and fathers, aunts 
and uncles wont remember or 
even care why they were in the 
Gulf; theyll want to know why 
they are not able to come back 
alive.
And we will not let them down.
Some of them will pass their 
last Thanksgiving dinner with the 
President. Others among them 
will pass their last Thanksgiving 
dinner without him. The lives of 
all American troops in the Gulf 
are in the Presidents hands.
And we will not let them down.
I dont know what the President 
should do next or whether the 
actions he has taken are wise or 
unwise. Im not asking the 
President to recall troops from 
the Persian Gulf; I dont question 
the purpose of Operation Desert 
Shield. I question whether or not 
the waiting game thats being 
played in the Gulf is the best plan 
of action. How much time should 
Hussein be allowed to withdraw 
his troops from Kuwait? Should 
we have attacked earlier? Should 
we attack at all? What number of 
American deaths is acceptable 
in an action that might resolve 
the crisis? What can we do to 
make sure that we dont let them 
down?
And we will not let them down.
I dont know the answers to 
these questions, but I sure hope 
that Bush does.

8The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  5 November 1990
Support members of Congress who voted to raise your taxes
Jonathan Levy
After five months of negotia
tions and a month of virtual handtor-Jiand combat in Washington 
D.C., last Monday morning Congj^ss took what appeared to be 
final vote on this years federal 
nmlget. I say appeared to be 
because the real vote on the budget 
YfiU happen tomorrow and it is 
th^t vote which has been driving 
process from the start. 
Tomorrow when tens of millions 
of Americans  including prob
ably about half a dozen Carnegie 
Mejlon studentsgo to the polls, 
tlje jobs of a third of the Senate 
ai^d all of the House of Repre
sentatives will be on the line.
popular wisdom says that you 
cant raise taxes  as the budget 
p^okage did  eight days before 
ah election without a voter backlflh against incumbent members 
o Congress.
Phis is especially true for Re
publicans, whose constituents are 
more likely to have bought into 
President Bushs 1988 promise of 
no new taxes.
Despite the fact that the final 
bill passed primarily on Demo
cratic votes, Bush is closely linked 
to the agreement and Republi
cans on Capitol Hill are setting 
new track and field records trying 
to run from any perceived asso
ciation with him before 
tomorrows votes are safely 
counted. The problem they and 
their Democratic colleagues are 
facing is the fact that the Ameri
can public is unwilling to pay a 
dime more in taxes, no matter 
how much the government may 
need the money.
During the last three presiden
tial campaigns, Bush and Ronald 
Reagan have told the voters that 
they can have all the government 
services they want without hav
ing to pay for them. Apparently a 
lot of people believed them since 
Reagan and Bush won all three 
elections.
While Reagan and four sessions 
of Congress managed to get 
through his presidency without 
having the bill come due, Bush 
and the current Congress have 
not been so lucky. It has become 
clear that the federal government 
is in a world of financial trouble 
and lawmakers can no longer hide 
the fact that something has to be 
done.
The national debt is at $3.2 tril

it Would happen one day, when

I was born here, and I have had a

lion; even with the provisions of 
the new budget plan, it will grow 
to $5 trillion in the next five years 
before the yearly budget is finally 
balanced.
It is also clear that this problem 
is not going to just disappear.
Americans have been politically 
anesthetized for at least the last
10 years, ripping apart our public 
finances without feeling the pain. 
But any doctor will tell you that a 
patient can only stay under an
esthesia for so long before dying.
Congress has finally started to 
wake us up by raising taxes and 
cutting spending, and it is no sur
prise that we are feeling some 
pain.
As a nation, we now have to 
decide whether we want to wake 
up fully  which is going to hurt 
even more  or go back to sleep 
and die.
To a large degree that decision 
is going to be made in tomorrows 
Congressional elections.
Despite at least two years on 
the job, and in many cases much 
more, a lot of members of Con
gress will win or lose largely on 
the basis of how they voted last 
Monday morning.
Unfortunately, in most races 
where the budget is the deciding 
factor, those who voted for the bill 
will lose and those who opposed it

ready to wake up yet and Con

parties realize it.
In one of the most cowardly

for the politicians to come out of 
the timid stupor in which they 
usually live and take some action, 
possibly unpopular, possibly 
painful, but necessary and direct 
action. I trusted the democratic 
process. Instead, I was confronted 
by a constant barrage of political 
dealing, backsliding, double
speak, and general Washington 
bullshit. I trusted Washington to 
do something to handle the mess. 
They did not.
As the Democrats and Republi
cans argued over just whos fault 
the mess was, the country slid 
deeper into trouble. As politicians 
tried to find a rock under which to 
hide, a way to avoid having to 
take any real chances, the deficit 
got larger, social programs 
slipped, and Ronald Reagan ap
peared on the cover of Time 
magazine.
Dissatisfaction with Washing
ton is nothing new. There is a 
general low-level throw-thebums-out feeling about Washing
ton, a sense that our Senators 
and Representatives are doing 
nothing but wasting our money 
and time. This time, however, 
things had gotten out of hand. 
The budget was not a new prob

growth indices were down  
things were coming to a head.
At a time when we needed 
elected officials most, Capitol Hill 
disappeared into a haze of accu

not to be found. Bush blamed 
Congress, Congress blamed 
Reagan and Bush, and everyone 
else tried to keep quiet. As a 
people, we were let down.

Some things that occurred to 
me at 2:50 am: What happens if 
you are a sick, hungry CMU stu
dent with a paper due and its 
4 am?
You suffer like the dog that you 
seem to be.
Why is it that not one campus 
outlet is open past 3 am? Why 
does the library close? Why do 
clusters close?
Admittedly, most people here 
are well-organized enough for this 
not to be a huge problem, but 
what about the freshman who is 
just coming into his or her highpressure situation? What does 
he or she do?
Lets say there is a sick man on 
your floor... hes really sick. Hes 
basically dying. Who do you call? 
Health services? No, of course 
notthey close at 5 pm. Instead, 
you call security, and you go to a 
hospital. Why dont we have a 
round-the-clock campus infir
mary? Why isnt there a full-time 
doctor on campus, rather than 
just the nurses who staff the 
health office?
Also, why cant I go down to the 
Tartan Grill right now and use 
another of the meals that I will 
probably lose? Why is there no 
late-night staff on duty? How 
much trouble could it possibly be 
to have a few people there to dole 
out the food?
While Im on the subject of the 
Dining Service, why does the 
school feel the perverse need to 
make it so difficult for those of us 
(i.e. independent freshmen) who 
have to be on a large meal plan?
The Highlander and Morewood 
Gardens cafeterias seem to never 
be open. The Tartan Grill has the 
shittiest, most overpriced food I 
have ever eaten, and Salads Plus, 
perhaps the only place on campus 
to get a near-decent meal, has the 
most erratic hours of all.
As an added minus, the meal 
plan allowances at Salads Plus 
and at Tartan Grill are so low as 
to make it nearly impossible to 
get a filling meal without going 
over. What with all the meals 
that students lose money on for 
not eating, it seems almost an 
insult to hear Youre over by a 
dollar from one of the cashiers. 
Adding insult to injury is the scale 
at Salads Plus, which for some 
reason always seems to have my 
plate weighed in at no less than1 
two dollars over the limit. It seems

Y-pU Nkq -2 k bkEEV wPower from nuclear fission: Is 
it really your friend, or not?
Jeffrey Woodford
In 1958, Lewis Strauss, then chairman of 
the Atomic Energy Commission, declared 
that electricity from the atom would soon 
be too cheap to meter.
Boy, was he wrong.
That kind of understatement ranks right 
up there with Neville Chamberlains Peace 
in our time in 1938.
For not only is electricity from nuclear 
fission plants less competitive than elec
tricity from coal-fired plants, its ecological 
and environmental costs are hugely greater. 
Not only must we contend with radioactive 
sludge that will be around for the next 
billion years or so (the half-life of uranium238, or the time it takes for half of the 
uranium sample to decay, is 4,500,000,000 
years), but we must also deal with the 
possibility that a nuclear reactor may melt 
down, killing thousands, and inflicting 
many with horrible radioactivity-induced 
diseases, such as leukemia. Weve already 
seen that its possible with the Three Mile 
Island accident and the Chernobyl melt
down.
Lets face it. Nuclear fission is inherently 
evil.
But this opinion is only one side of the
coin. The other side says, Hey wait a 
minute. Youve got it all wrong. Nuclear 
fission is your friend. Its the design of the 
nuclear reactor thats faultyits too com
plex. Current light-water reactors use an 
elaborate system of pumps to move the 
water around in cooling the nuclear core 
and converting water to steam, which turns 
turbines.
Ifyoureliedless on pumps, which require 
copious amounts of electricity, and more on 
natural forces, such as gravity, a better 
system would be achieved.
New designs are being developed as we 
speak. One system involves water injection 
jets being located above the nuclear core, so 
if the cooling system should somehow 
rupture, the core would remain submerged. 
Another system uses molten sodium as the 
cooling liquid instead of water: molten so
dium gobbles heat much more effectively 
than water.
Besides, coal- and oil-fired power plants 
give off nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides 
which cause acid rain and make air virtu
ally unbreathable. Nuclear reactors only 
give off carbon dioxide. Also, in the event of 
an energy crisis, we can rely on supplies of 
uranium much longer than we can rely on 
supplies of natural gas or oil; even though 
uranium is nonrenewable, the supplies are 
much larger than those of natural gas and 
oil.
So, you see, with these new designs for 
nuclear fission reactors, the possibility of a 
meltdown is virtually nonexistent. And we
Hey wait a minute. 
You've got it all wrong. 
Nuclear fission is your 
friend."  ,rt
cannot continue using coal, oil, and naftrral gas indefinitely; supplies will run out 
and our environment will be destroyecL 
Energy based on solar or wind energy are 
not yet ready for large-scale production of 
electricity. Nuclear reactors must be'in;-'] 
corporated into the energy grid of Amer^k 
if we want to save our environment.
So there you have it.
But whats this other type of nucl^&f 
power Ive heard aboutnuclear fusion?''
Thats when two atoms come together ak 
one, releasing energy in the process. Nxi 
radioactive sludge, no toxic gases releas^cf 
However, this system requires extremely 
high temperatures, so hot that all con
tainment vessles we have available tod&>1 
would melt. All of them.
Therefore, scientists are working Wiffi1 
the idea of a magnetic containment fieW: 
for the fusion fuel. But the technology is 
simply not availablenot in this century fi
anyway.:om

to who fraternity members want

fresh meat?
I have been told that most of 
these comments are intended in 
jest, and my response is: At whose 
expense are you laughing? What 
kind of a general attitude does 
this promote? Maybe I am going 
to extremes here, but rape and 
sexual assault are extreme and 
serious crimes, and it is the kinds
of attitudes portrayed in the above 
examples that lead to making rape 
acceptable.
I think its great that you dont 
support rape. I wish there were 
more frat members like you. In a 
sense, it is a shame that all frater
nity members are judged together, 
but those who join fraternities 
know that they will be regarded 
according to the reputation oftheir 
house. Unfortunately, the general 
attitude of fraternities toward 
women leads people to judge them
as a whole.
Frankly, those anti-rape signs 
are a lot less offensive than what 
is happening to women on this 
campus so often and the fact that 
individuals have to resort to spray 
paint in their attempts to stop it. 
If you are against rape, you should 
be applauding the efforts to alle
viate the problem, rather than 
worrying that you will be consid
ered a rapist by association.

The Tartan football team con
tinued its winning ways Satur
day, beating the Coast Guard

its playoff drive alive. The Tar

unblemished 8-0 record and a 
number five rankinginthe NCAA 
Division III South Region polls.
The top four teams  Ferrum, 
Washington & Jefferson, 
Frostburg State and Lycoming 
are also undefeated, so a win over 
Coast Guard was crucial. Al
though the Tartans have the third 
toughest schedule of the top five, 
there is still a chance they could

Saturday was a game of firsts. 
It was the first meeting between 
the CMU and CGA and the first 
time this season that the Tartans 
have faced the wishbone offense. 
The Bears ground attack gained 
249 yards, but the Tartan defense 
came up with big plays and key 
turnovers to snap the usually 
potent wishbone. The wishbone 
is a run-oriented offense that uses
three running backs.
We knew what was going to 
come at us but they executed re

You cant have a wishbone and 
a good passing team, too. I think

University of Chicago. The win raised the Tartans 
overall record to 12-4-1, which includes a final 5^-

The Tartans impressive season was soured hy

Special to The Tartan
The Carnegie Mellon Rowing 
Club won two golds, a silver, and 
a bronze medal Saturday at the 
Head of the Occaquon, outside of 
Washington, D.C.
The regatta was a three and a 
quarter mile course, raced against 
the clock. The varsity and novice 
teams competed against others 
from Johns Hopkins, Bucknell, 
West Virginia, Duquesne and 
many others.
The Womens varsity four fin
ished third, with a time of 20:17, 
close behind first place Potomac 
Boat Club. The women beat 
crosstown rivals, Duquesne by
nearly a minute. Duquesne fin
ished fifth.
History was made when the 
lightweight varsity mens eight 
finished second in their event. 
This was the first time the club 
placed in this highly competitive 
division. Sophomore Roderick 
Gibson was quite pleased after 
the race. Dude, we were awe
some! It was the best race of my 
life!
The mens novice four brought 
home the gold in their very close 
race, beating out second-placed 
St. Johns College by only three 
seconds. In the tradition of race 
winners, they attempted to throw 
their coxswain into the river, but

Graduate student Dave Greene 
won the gold medal in the Single 
Scull race, beating the second 
place finisher by 17 seconds.
The other races fared well too. 
The varsity womens eight fin
ished fourth, only eleven seconds 
behind William and Mary in third. 
The novice mens eight finished 
sixth out of 19 boats.
The outstanding performances 
by the lightweight varsity and
novice men were much more sig
nificant for three of the rowers. 
Varsity, Ed Miller, and Novices, 
Fritz Knabe and Dave Garrod are 
graduate students who are ineli
gible to row after this season. 
Miller expressed that he was 
thrilled with the success of the 
crew, but disappointed that he 
could no longer compete.
Miller was pleased with his 
performance, especially since this 
was his final year competing in
crew. Im glad that I managed to; 
medal in my last race, he said.
Coach Liz Winter was pleased 
with the spread of medals, as well, 
as with the performance of thej 
mens lightweight team. The! 
lightweight men finally showed 
their true form, she said. She 
added that it is positive fore-i 
shadowing for the future, and that 
the trend should continue.

about the teams performance.

Edmonton losing magic as Rangers boast best record
Originally, this season looked 
to-be a promising one for the 
Edmonton Oilers. Instead, itcould 
signal the end of the Edmonton 
dynasty.
" 'Hart Trophy Winner center
 'ilark Messier has been injured 
Since October 16. Since the begin"nlng of his absence, the Oilers 
have lost five games in a row for 
the first time since 1984. In the
 'sime period, they scored only 12 
'' gfials and had a stretch of eight
consecutive scoreless periods.
 Jarri Kurris suprise departure

As the standings show now, the 
team to beat seems to be the New

currently second in the league

Both the New Jersey Devils and 
the Los Angeles Kings continue 
their chase of the Rangers. The

A three-way battle for the top 
spot in the Norris Division is de
veloping between the Chicago 
Blackhawks, the Detroit Red 
Wings, and the St. Louis Blues. 
Chicago is a dramatically im
proved team. Compared to this 
point in the season last year, The 
Blackhawks have allowed 14 
fewer goals. Compared to two 
seasons ago, they have allowed
33 fewer. Clearly, the addition of 
former Norris Trophy Winner 
defense Chris Chelios has con
tributed significantly. Chelios is 
perhaps the best two-way 
defenseman in the league. He is 
also currently in the top ten 
scorers.
The strongest competition in the 
Norris Division is definitely the 
St. Louis Blues. However, if oppo
nents can contain star right wing 
Brett Hull, they have an improved 
chance against the Blues. In 
games where Hull has scored, the 
Blues are 8-1. When Hull has 
been shut out, they are 0-3-1. So 
far, Hull is the leading goal scorer 
with 16.

next year. [There is] a lot of talent 
on the team, said Fisher. The 
team is young, and with another 
years experience the Tartans 
could do well next season.
Fisher had only good things to 
say about her team. Senior cap
tain Nicole Hanak played very
[The numbers dont] show what a 
good team they were. Theres more to 
it than that. 
 Head Coach Charlotte Fisher
consistently all year in all aspects
 serving, defense, blocking, and 
hitting. Sophomore Ann Feng also 
played very well as a back-row 
player and earned many compli
ments from other teams and 
coaches. Junior Lisa Devlin and 
sophomore Jennifer New did very 
well as the teams new setters.
The Tartans greatly missed
sophomore Lisa Leonardo in the 
middle of the season and sopho
more Elizabeth Rowlands at the 
end of the seasondue to injury. 
Sophomore Heather Thompson 
sparked the team with her excite
ment on the court or by getting 
big defensive saves.
Freshman Wendy Waskoe did 
not play much during the year 
but gained the coachs respect with 
her determination.
She needs some more court 
time out there, said Fisher, before
she becomes very good. The bench 
also played an important rolelby 
being ready at any time and play
ing when the starters were in
jured.
Fisher concluded her praise of 
the team by saying, [The num
bers dont] show what a good team 
they were. Theres more to it th[an 
that.
The team will be practicing; in 
the off- season and may run a co
ed tournament for Carnegie 
Mellon students.

just as tough a time getting the 
ill out of their end of the field. 
Despite fighting the wind, the 
Tartans notched the first score of 
the afternoon. Sophomore 
Terence Sibiya split a pair of 
Maroon defenders to hit junior 
Young Kang, the Tartans lead
ing scorer. Kang rocketed the ball

Throughout the Intramural 
season, the IM department main
tains a point system, awarding 
teams points for their perfor
mance in Intramural activities. 
At the end of the year, a trophy is 
awarded to the team with the 
:niost points.
The Intramural department 
devised a system in 1986 of fig
uring points.
Individual team standings are 
ased on the skill rating of the 
8Port, the rating of the league, the 
number of teams in the league, 
and the rating of the finish of the 
team.
The formula used is (skill rat
1-0 Tartan lead.
The wind kept the Tartans from 
scoring, but it took away the 
Maroons best scoring opportu
nity as well. Chicago caught 
freshman goalkeeper Dave 
Shapiro out of position, but the 
shot carried over the top crossbar.
The Tartans went into the sec
ond half with a 1-0 lead and the 
wind at their backs; however,
ing) x (league rating) x (# of teams 
in league) x (finish rating).
A skill rating is assigned to each 
sport on a scale of one to five. 
Football, for example, rates a five, 
while soccer rates a four, co-rec 
volleyball a three, tennis a two, 
and chess rates a one.
Majors, Intermediates, and mi
nors are all assigned a league 
rating. Majors is rated 10, inter
mediates is rated three, while 
minors is rated one.
The number of teams in a league 
is the number of teams in the 
league in which the team is com
peting (majors, intermediates, or 
minors.)
Chicago held the Tartans until 
late in the game. With less than 
15 minutes to play, Kang scored 
on a header off a CMU comer 
kick. The goal was Kangs 15th of 
the season, establishing a new 
team record. Kang had an oppor
tunity for a third goal but had a 
bad angle by the time he cleared 
the Chicago defense.
Theyre a struggling team,
said Gaudioso, but theyre young 
and theyve got a new coach. T 
think the UAA will get more com
petitive in the next couple of 
years.
Despite being an easy Tartan 
win, the game took its toll on the 
players. A bad knee forced junior 
sweeper Alan Horn to leave the 
game in the secondhalf, andjunior 
Rob Schaeffer was injured in a
cheap shot with less than a minute 
left in the game.
The guy wasnt even going for 
the ball, said Schaeffer. He just 
wanted to go for the hack.
The Tartans also set or tied 
several team records in 1990, set
ting marks for consecutive wins, 
most wins, and consecutive shut
outs. The Tartans were one game 
away from the record for most
shutouts in a season.
Despite missing the playoffs, 
Gaudioso is pleased with th'e 
team. How can you not be happy 
with a 12-4 record? In the last 
two years, if we had a home field, 
wed have had better records; this 
year, we got a lot of big wins.
Im disappointed about the 
playoffs, but well be strong next 
year.
IM Team Standings
The finish rating is the score 
given to first, second, third, or 
fourth place in the league. First 
place receives one point, second 
receives two-thirds of a point, and 
third and fourth receive one-third 
of a point. Third and fourth place 
receive a finish rating of 0 if there 
are not more than six teams in a 
league.
A sample score tabulation fol
lows:
Sigma Alpha Epsilon placed 
first in intermediate touch foot
ball, for which they received 225 
points, 
skill rating = 5 
league rating = 3
# of teams in league = 15
finish rating = 1
(5) x (3) x (15) x (1) = 225.
The team standings of this year 
so far follow. The standings are 
based on the results from foot
ball, cross country, tennis, golf, 
and co-rec volleyball.
Please note that these standings 
may change significantly as the 
year progresses. Also note that 
the teams below are not the only 
teams entered in IM activities;

Jdent Vijay Balkrishna. 
[.Competitive dancing in the fesil was broken down into three 
isions: social, American, and 
^national. The social division, 
uch has no dance syllabus or 
lired figures within individual 
ices, included the charcha, the

 rhumba.

waltz; the American Latin dances 
were the mambo, the cha-cha, the 
swing, and the rhumba.
The international smooth 
dances were the foxtrot, the waltz, 
the quickstep, and the tango; the 
international Latin dances were 
the cha-cha, the jive, the samba, 
and the bolero.
Although some of the same 
dances appear in both American 
and international categories, 
there are stylistic differences be
tween the divisions; for example, 
in the American style, partners 
are allowed to step away from 
each other, while in the interna
tional style, partners must remain 
in constant contact.
Both the American and inter
national divisions featured becompetition.
People who compete generally 
try to.be at least four-dancers, 
said festival coordinator Cindy 
Wood, meaning that couples try 
to be well-versed in all four dances

able to bring their own music 
along with them, and therefore 
must adapt their steps to what
ever music is provided.
Some single dancers ended up 
being paired with partners theyd 
never met from other schools, 
which caused problems in some 
cases. Many groups, though, try 
to get their members used to rap
idly switching from partner to 
partner before the competition 
rolls around.
It depends on the person, too, 
said Jeff Rosenfeld, a member of 
the Carnegie Mellon Ballroom 
Dance Club. Some people arejust 
beautiful to dance with  either 
they just have natural ability or 
they practice a lot. In the club, we 
encourage people to switch part

ballroom dancing than just the 
types of dance. Costumes also play 
a large role in creating an appear

While men generally wear tux

and other particles which may 
mat the suede and cause the 
dancer to slip. The shoes generally 
cost about $80.
The shoes are regulation  
theyre the only thing thats re
quired at this competition, said 
Wood. Otherwise, women can 
wear cocktail dresses and men 
can wear suits.
Poise and attitude are also im
portant in creating a good im
pression. If you dont believe 
youre looking good, no one els^ 
believes youre lookinggood, said 
Aki Ohshima, a third-year PhD 
student in electrical and chemical 
engineering, and the president of 
the CMU Ballroom Dance Club.
Lessons can also be pretty 
costly. Members of the club pay 
only $2 per lesson, but according 
to the clubs teacher, Mary 
Kellner, outside lessons run on 
the average of $50 to $100 an 
hour.
The club began when one of its 
founders, Ayami Ogura, began 
calling up people whom she knew 
liked ballroom dance to try to set 
up a carpool to go to local dance 
halls. Since then, the organiza
tion has grown tremendously, at
tracting many new members  
and keeping them.
The competition marks the 
clubs growth from just a few 
people two summers ago to a 
thriving organization which now 
has more than 50 dues-paying 
members, according to Rosenfeld.

.,Gity limits.
'In 1990, this continuing trend 
;-of expansion has catapulted 
Oakland to the position of the 
$hird fastest growing urban 
:,area in Pennsylvania, behind 
Philadelphia and downtown 
Pittsburgh. Since 1983, there 
has been $369 million worth of 
^construction ,1.7 million 
additional square feet of space, 
,and 574 new homes. Oaklands 
llittractiveness as a center for 
hospitals, universities, and 
retail businesses contributed to 
'-much of this growth.
 -To residents of the city and 
; ""the region who have suffered 
^massive restructuring of the 
; "employment base, Oaklands 
| tgrowth means new jobs. To 
; "many community and private
* ^'organizations, this is a chance 
; rto set up retail businesses,
'develop the university and 
medical community, and in
crease housing space. Many of 
ffiblese groups have established 
.;U4tworks and links among 
^themselves to help organize,
;^develop and maintain Oaklands 
; "growth.
! * City Planning Director Jane 
-Downing sees business growth 
~as a vital element to the resi
dents of Oakland. It represents 
I -potential employment for the 
! -community which is important 
 for stimulating growth, she 
;-says. But at the same time, we 
  dont want residential areas to
* ^deteriorate. We have to balance 
 'competing demands.
One way to balance the 
demand is through partnerships 
with private organizations. The 
former Mayor Richard Caliguiri 
created the Oakland Task
D.O.C.
Dalmo Optical Corp.
Force, a part of the Oakland 
Plan of the early 1970s, as a 
joint project designed to work 
with various community groups 
and businesses. It is an infor
mation exchange, says Down
ing.
The City Planning Depart
ment, which acts as a regula
tory agency by issuing zoning 
and subdivision ordinances, 
plays an important part in the 
coordination efforts. We are 
involved with a lot of different 
organizations and look for ways 
to better calibrate community 
and business growth, says 
Downing. It takes all of us to 
come up with a plan.
Pittsburghs aging infrastruc
ture poses the biggest problem 
for development. For an area 
with 35,000 shoppers and 
visitors per year, 31,000 stu
dents, 21,000 permanent 
residents, and 47,000 cars 
passing through daily, transpor
tation can be a nightmare.
There will be increased 
traffic and congestion which 
makes it hard for the commu
nity to deal with parking and 
getting in and around Oakland, 
Downing says.
Richard Gleeson, commercial 
development director of the 
Oakland Planning and Develop
ment Corporation (OPDC), also 
agrees that transportation 
conditions are problematic.
One major problem is the lack 
of short-term customer park
ing, he says. A shrinking 
growth market would pose 
further problems. If there are a 
lack of businesses, it makes 
land values rise, Gleeson
explains. But he offers an 
optimistic solution: We try to 
encourage developers to reserve 
a place for community-serving 
businesses by providing first 
floor retail space.
Sandra Phillips, director of 
the Pittsburgh Partnership for 
Neighborhood Development 
(PPND), believes that the need 
to solve those problems is in 
everyones self-interests.
The PPND is a non-profit 
intermediary organization 
which provides money and 
resources to community devel
opment groups like the OPDC. 
Phillips, who used to be director 
of OPDC, knows the value of 
cooperation. You have to 
manage the growth between 
development and residential 
concerns, she says.
The residents, however, are 
not entirely happy with 
Oaklands development.
Gleeson perceives a mixed 
reaction from residents about 
the rapid development of 
Oakland. The growth is good 
for increasing the business 
base, providing office space, and 
parking garages, but it is bad 
because more cars and people 
add to the transportation 
problems.
To help keep in touch with 
residents, the OPDC provides 
staff support for Oakland 
Directions, Incorporated, a 
community-based organization. 
We may consider scaled down 
versions of buildings closer to 
residential areas, Gleeson 
describes as one of the ways to 
accommodate residents.
For the most part, OPDC,
 -iff --> >" -4
Thomas Nichols/Tartan Senior Photographer 
PPND, and other groups are 
interested in accommodating 
many different interests and a 
wide rage of clientele. We try to 
encourage diversification of 
retail businesses, says Gleeson. 
These businesses are designed 
to serve the resident, student, 
and employee needs.
The results of their efforts 
can be seen all over Oakland. 
OPDC has put up Holmes Place, 
a 64-unit town house/condo
minium complex in South 
Oakland, on the site of the 
former Holmes Elementary 
School, and two more 12-unit 
buildings are planned. The 
PPND invested its time and 
money into low income housing 
projects around Oakland.
Gleeson feels that projects 
like these will attract many 
more people to the area. Oak
land is a thriving cultural 
center with major hospitals, 
universities, and big organiza
tions. If it were anywhere else, 
it would be its own city, he 
says.
One begins to wonder about 
Oaklands limit of expansion; 
Gleeson sees these limits as 
managed growth. Brian Kim, 
a junior in CIT said, ...growth 
that is good for everyone. 
Phillips believes that managing 
growth in Oakland means 
controlling city zoning ordi
nances through what she calls 
zoning overlay. She continued, 
You want to have zoning 
flexibility to accommodate 
development, but zoning is also 
a useful tool for limiting 
growth. Phillips and many 
others are optimistic about

Carnegie Mellon students came 
jut in full frce Tuesday night to 
oice their belief that freedom of 
xpression must remain abso
lutely free. In Only As Nasty As 
\Ve Want You To Be, a debate 
sponsored by the CMU Activities 
Board on the hot topic of music 
censorship, Florida lawyer Jack 
Thompson sparred with Bob 
Juccione, Jr. Thompson was one 
if the primary figures responsible 
or the arrest of the rap group 2 
Live Crew; Guccione.is the editor 
of Spin magazine and a vocal op
ponent of music censorship. After
the formal debate, the rivals responded ttf questions and com
ments from 22 students, all of 
whom opposed Thompsons view 
that 2 Live Crew should be pros
ecuted for obscenity.
Thompson, who spoke first, 
summarized his opinion, I 
havent gone after Luther 
Campbell (the leader of 2 Live 
Crew) because hes black. Ive gone 
after him because hes ... been 
criminally pedalling obscenity 
which he calls comedy to children 
and adults in violation of the ob
scenity statutes which have been 
held constitutional by the United 
States Supreme Court and which 
are on the books to protect women
I find it offensive that youre saying 
that youre standing up for women 
who have been assaulted when all 
youre going after is a rap group.

and children and, yes, even men 
from the consequences of buying 
into the idea that women are less 
than men and can be legitimately 
sexually abused.
The main focus of Thompsons 
opening speech was expressed in 
a quote taken from the Attorney 
Generals commission on pornog
raphy: Pornography is used in 
rape to plan it, to execute it, to 
choreograph it, to engender the 
excitement to commit the very 
act.... It keeps us (women) socially 
silent, it keeps us socially compli
ant, it keeps us afraid in neigh
borhoods, and it creates a vast 
hopelessness for women, a vast 
despair. One lives inside a night
mare of sexual abuse that is both 
actual and potential, and you have 
the great joy of knowing that your 
nightmare is someone elses 
freedom, and someone elses fun. 
In his opening speech, Guccione 
stated his opinion quite simply. I 
vigorously, vehemently, passion
ately, almost fanatically believe 
that freedom of speech has to be 
free, that freedom of expression 
has to be unlimited, and I do so 
knowing that this incorporates 
an awful lot of very offensive 
material into our society....
I dont think any of us are fine 
enough surgeons to go into the 
culture and extract and remove 
only the stuff that everyone agrees 
is bad. And to start to go into the 
culture and slice away bits of it, to 
cut a piece of the fabric, is to
invariably expose a thread that 
someone else will unravel, said 
Guccione.
After Thompson and Guccione 
expressed their opinions and had 
the opportunity to rebut the op
position, members of the audi
ence stepped to the podium to 
have their personal concerns with 
the issue addressed.
Many students concerns fo
cused on Thompsons belief that 
pornography and sexual abuse 
share a cause/effect relationship. 
The root cause of rape is not an 
obscene recording... said H&SS 
freshman Tony Gancarski. Its a 
society...thats basically encour
aged the problem by not looking 
for a solution.
Women are not raped by rap 
groups. They are raped by people, 
said Elizabeth Cronise, a junior 
in H&SS. I find it offensive that 
youre saying that youre standing 
up for women who have been as
saulted when all youre going af
ter is a rap group. Its not an equal 
judgement.
Others were afraid of what 
might happen next. Once you 
start prosecuting one artist, then 
its not that big of a jump to 
prosecute another...and another, 
and the question is, where do you 
draw the line? said Chris Rapier, 
a senior in H&SS.
Still others were angry that 
anyone would take it upon them
selves to determine what they 
could and could not expose themJason Dlgman/Tartan Senior Darkroom Technician

selves to. Im not advocating 2 
Live Crew  I think their music 
is terrible...and it does depict 
images that I dont want to think 
about, but thats why I dont go 
out and buy their album, said 
Aaron Skalka, a CFA freshman. 
Go to the root problems...help 
people who need help. Start 
teaching ethics. Help build fam
ily units. But dont tell me what I 
can and cant listen to. Dont tell 
me what I can look at and cant
look at. Thats just not for you to 
decide. Thats for me to decide. 
In responding to the claims 
made by both Guccione apd 
Thompson during the inter vigjw, 
the CMU students in the audi
ence displayed their opinions 
adamantly: they will not be told 
what they are and are not allowed 
to do, see, or listen to. The stu
dents exercised their ffyst 
amendment rights to free speech 
by defending those very rights.
Editor of SPIN magazine reflects on politics of career
ly MEGAN DIETZ
1artan Staffwriter
Bob Guccione, Jr., is a man with 
mission. To hear him, one might 
hink of him as a twenty-first 
entury preacher with a uniquely 
rast audience. I think journalism 
3 sacred in a way because it is the 
afrnite pursuit of truth, the uneachable pursuit of truth. You 
an never quite reach the truth 
vhich journalism aspires to ... 
ut I find it to be an elevating 
nission, says SPIN magazine 
ditor Bob Guccione, Jr. Im ex
ited by the idea of perpetuating 
Jumalism.
SPIN, one of the most popular 
nusic magazines among collegeiged people, started years ago 
vhen Guccione was, as he decribes it, too restless. The Ger
mans have ,a word for it, sitz 
leisch, which means, literally, sit 
lesh. I just couldnt sit.
I came up with the idea of this 
nagazine and immediately forgot 
ibout it.... I said, Thats great  
dont know how to do a magazine, 
dont have any money, and I 
'ouldnt know where to start, 
ays Guccione. But later on ... it 
Ust hit me, that this was a vocaon, not a whim. And so I em,arked on the mission of creating 
md inaugurating SPIN.
The philosophy behind the 
magazine is, to Guccione, the 
biggest draw. I love the potential 
|fthe magazine to communicate 
large numbers of people ... and 
think that theres an ideology to 
m thats completely absent 
om [its competitors]... they dont 
eally have the energy, the vital
ly. the sense of romance that a 
'ounger audience, the age of the 
1 ^A/reader, wants. We are more 
^Passioned,  he claimed.
1 he vitality of the magazine, 
 continued, comes from the 
1 lared desire to define growing 
lP> to define the culture, a real 
aterest in new music, not having 
p *ait until its Top 40, that Phil
0 ins just isnt as exciting as a 
new group.
According to Guccione, music
;s ne thing which binds people
together, because it deals with 
the issues which define the culture 
of those who listen to it. SPIN 
aspires to address the issues im
portant to its readership, as well. 
Thats why theres an AIDS col
umn in SPIN  it has more rel
evance to this audience than most 
of the things in magazines trying 
to hit this audience, even though 
it wouldnt seem to fit in a rock-nroll publication, says Guccione. 
If we were in the middle of the 
Vietnam War, wed be writing 
about the Vietnam War. 
Guccione also includes AIDS in 
his list of the most important is
sues facing the college-aged per
son. .. .We know so little about it, 
and part of the problem is that 
the government pretends they 
know so much about it.... Its like 
someone putting together a forty 
thousand piece jigsaw puzzle and 
starting to declare what the pic
ture looks like after putting to
gether 3 or 4 pieces.
Another important issue, ac
cording to Guccione, is the envi
ronment. The mantle is passed 
from generation to generation, 
and the world they [the collegeaged generation] are being passed 
is like a broken batyou can run
with it, but its still broken.
Censorship is a gigantic issue. 
Like AIDS, were only looking at 
the tip of the iceberg, and we dont 
know how big the iceberg is be
neath the tip we can see. Cen
sorship of music, in and of itself, 
is less significant than the import 
of where it can lead to.
Censorship of music is a bad 
enough thingeven if it stopped 
just there, it would be terrible, it 
would be wrong, it would be unAmerican, it would go against the 
grain of everything youre taught 
in this school.... Its like acid be
cause it erodes the culture.
In his defense of any and all 
forms of artistic expression, 
Guccione hopes to preserve op
portunities for future generations.
Censorship is a social dilemma, 
because [when it happens] it 
means that the generation before 
you had the privilege of access to 
more information, the ability to 
have broader discussions than 
your generation will have.... The 
premise that music is damaging 
is, first of all, completely un
proven, and, second of all, offen
sive and intellectually ignorant.
Guccione was bom in New York, 
but grew up in London. His up
bringing has unquestionably af
fected his views.
I grew up in an environment 
that was liberal and I was better 
for it.... Liberal views constitute 
all of the milestones in Americas 
progress, like Social Security, 
Medicare, unionism, the idea of 
breaking away from Britain in 
the first place, he said.
And liberalism is like art... it 
often precedes understanding.by 
afewyears. It often takes a couple 
of years for us to catch up and 
realize that the idea we found so 
difficult was, in fact, just ahead of 
its time.

wasnt that excited, but Im much 
better now, she laughed.
Wood, a researcher in the school 
of Computer Science, estimated 
that about 20 couples had pre
registered for the event, and oth
ers had said they would bring 
their checks with them.
The package cost $40 for com

Wed be happy with however 
many we get, said Wood. If its 
small, itll be really personal, and 
if its big, then  great.
In part, the festival was a fund
raiser to send a competitive team 
of about six couples to London in 
March, according to Wood. But 
even if we just break even, well

sented in the popular media: that 
of men wearing flannel sitting 
around a campfire drinking lite 
beer, or of dry-beer-drinking men 
sharing with each other the tech
nological miracle which allows 
them to produce swimming pools 
and scantily clad women from a 
silver plated valise, or, genuinedraft-beer-drinking men con
quering rapids, conquering mar
lins or conquering each other (oh, 
stop that leering, I am only 
making a point).
I cannot say that ideas of what 
male bondingis are manufactured 
through beer commercials. 
Rather, the notions that are por
trayed and perpetuated through 
advertising represent the general 
societal malaise which keeps a 
heterosexual male from being able 
to say, Gosh, hes good looking, 
without the initial caveat I am 
strictly speaking from an aes
thetic appreciation of the human 
form which I objectively perceive 
without emotional or sexual in
volvement; the opinion I am about 
to express signifies nothing about 
my sexual orientation whatso
ever, a sentiment colloquially 
expressed as I aint gay, but....
Obviously, there is a societal 
model for the archetypal conideal system there are several 
essential guidelines which must 
be strictly followed in order to 
insure the development of true 
friendship. These guidelines are 
as follows:
Number one: Men can only be 
friends if they are outdoors. This 
is a given. How can male-to-male 
friendships ever flourish without 
the requisite crashing waves, 
rolling hills, and running horses? 
Of course, in my head, the image 
of crashing waves, rolling hills, 
and running horses inevitably 
conjure thoughts of star-crossed 
lovers running into each others 
arms.
But I say this from a strictly 
aesthetic frame of reference which 
I objectively perceive without 
emotional or sexual involvement.
Oddly enough the most touch
ing moment of so-called male 
bonding I have ever been privy to
last item in this list may be debat
able, but anybody who has sat 
through such macho fare as 
Commando,Lethal Weapons I and
II, and, of course, The Driller 
Killer knows what Im talking 
about.
Personally, I have a deeply en
trenched fear of power tools and 
would rather see them become 
the strictly protected domain of a 
gender other than my own. Alas, 
egalitarianism must prevail, 
meaning that whenever the chal
lenge of bookcase-making rears 
its ugly head I will stand up, 
proudly wielding that power drill 
along with all of my brothers and 
sisters in carpentry.
My perception is that under the 
prevailing societal dogma men 
cannot truly be friends without 
destroying some form of life. The 
example of my evening of dental 
hygiene with my brother is no
behind funeral homes in the 
middle of the night would never 
take place.
Although I will admit that the 
latter may be too personal an ex
ample to be counted in this con
text, I did spit often on that 
Christmas eve with my brother.
These three simple rules have a 
Byzantine network of subrules 
and regulations which include 
mandates such as men may not 
embrace without grunting and 
slapping each other simulta
neously, no man may kiss an
other unless the presence of alco
holic intoxication can be unerr
ingly proven in retrospect, men 
must scratch audibly, and no 
man may kiss another full on the 
lips unless he is A1 Pacino in The 
Godfather Part II.
Ultimately, these rules do very 
little to disguise the fact of their 
own inability to rob all male
creted fair share of bodily 
and spent a great deal of time in 
the great outdoors.
The problem lies in that these 
three categories tend to engulf 
and shut out many other aspects 
of same-sex friendships under a 
false standard of what it is to be a 
real man.
But the ideal of the real man 
which beer and cigarette com. 
mercials express is simply not 
enough to convey the range o 
feelings which human beings can 
harbor for one another regardless 
of sexual orientation or prefeH 
ence in power tools. The absolute 
expression of true friendship 
should not be restricted to the byi 
laws of the Pennsylvania Game 
Commission, but rather to that 
gesture which best expresses th( 
nature of ones fondness for another.
Obviously, making a value
occurred on Christmas Eve, two exception to this rule, as many bonding rituals of their innate judgment between hunting and
years ago when my brother, 
dental student at Pitt, asked me 
the question do you floss? 
When I explained that my busy 
schedule kept me from flossing 
frequently, he proceeded to sit me 
down, whip out his trusty John
son and Johnsons unwaxed floss 
dispensapak (I told you he was a 
dental student) and teach me the 
proper way to floss.
We were in the den. A den inside 
a house that is.
Number two: All male bonding 
must involve some allusion to 
death. Naturally, there can be no
strands of hideous tartar met their 
doom that night.
Number three: Friendship be
tween males must be facilitated 
by the production of bodily fluids. 
As nasty as this may sound, the 
hallmarks of male bonding seem 
to be spitting, urinating, sweating, 
and drinking. Hair splitters may 
argue that beer is not a bodily 
fluid.
Some argue that these people 
, have not engaged their taste buds 
appropriately. I argue that with
out beer, representative models 
of male bonding activities such as
homo-erotic content. Almost every 
action counted as male-bonding 
reeks with the sexual intentions 
they so adamantly claim to reject. 
Even the vocabulary of malebonding is clothed, or rather un
clothed in innuendo  hunting, 
fishing, drinking, sweating, 
smoking, and drilling, need I say 
more?
Before I continue, I must admit 
that many of the actions com
monly equated with male-bond
ing do evoke genuine feelings of 
friendship. I would be a hypocrite 
if I were to make a wholesale
flossing is not in my place. But 
perhaps if anybody out there feels 
the need to rebel against the con! 
ventions officially sanctioned by 
the Beer Distributors of America 
reach out and without the obliga 
tory grunt, slap or projection of a 
hocker, touch a guy.
But avoid some of the naughtj 
bits; There are some places where 
even the most die hard of macho 
men can be accused of hypersen 
sitivity.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  5 November 1990L5
Students recommend potpourri of courses
BVLfq :kqVR
'artan Contributing Editor
This week, students will be 
unning around campus to stand 
n lines. The lines will be long and 
he students will be tired. They 
ill clutch their add/drop forms 
e their hands hoping that theyll 
ret into the classes that they need 
o graduate. With sweat on their 
rows, the tension will be thicker 
han any soup ever offered at 
jjghlander. The lines will be in 
very building. Some students will 
ven spend the night outside their 
epartment to ensure they get 
he right class.
But the inevitable will happen, 
tudents will panic. Screams will 
,e heard. They will have room for 
lectives. Which elective to take 
-Surrealistic Marxism: A Study 
n Bunnies and Rabbits or The 
Advanced Dynamics of Ground
water Hydrology in Utah Soil? 
yhich professor is better? Is the 
ass an easy A?
So, to make life easier, here is 
ome advice for those students 
/ho will find themselves with an 
lective.
The first suggestion comes from 
lark Fisher, a sophomore engieering student. The course that 
would recommend is Statics and 
Jynamics with Glen Sinclair. 
iisher says he recommends 
iinclair for a simple reasion: Hes 
he only good teacher Ive had at 
his school.
Laura Harkcom, a sophomore 
H&SS student, recommends a 
course in another department: 
definitely Fundamentals of 
Drama with Scott Cummings,she 
says. Its fun and interesting. Its 
the only class Ive had fun in. Its 
like a survey course  it covers 
all kinds of drama, from classical 
to Victorian to modem. 
Harkcom isnt alone in her 
recommendation of Fundamen
tals of Drama. Lauren Van Ham, 
a CFA freshman, agrees. The 
class exposes you to a lot of litera
ture. Being exposed to all that 
literature is like taking a history, 
a psychology, and a English class 
all in one, she says.
Although ots a hard course, 
MCS sophomore Graham Hill 
recommends professor Robert 
Schumachers Physical Mechan
ics course. You cant help but be 
confused, he says. On the first 
day of class, he said Remember 
Physics I? Its wrong. Then he 
said things like Lets integrate 
this from zero to zero, but we cant 
because its only one-dimensional. 
Lets expand it.  Hill closed his 
recommendation with a piece of 
advice that Schumaker always 
said in class: Just binomially ex
pand when in trouble.
Jim Honan, a senior in CIT, has 
taken four semesters of French. 
I think the Modem Languages 
department has improved a lot 
since Ive been here, he said. I 
would recommend any French

It wasnt just another assignent for a group of CMU stunts in Joseph Lewis class, 
lese students in his 2D Design 
ass were assigned to participate 
a poster competition comlemorating the tenth anniveriry of The Greater Pittsburgh 
ommunity Food Bank. The 
leme of the contest was Poverty 
the 90s. Among top the finhers in the competition was 
eshman Darren J. Press, who 
iptured second place.
Instructor Joseph Lewis asgned this project not only once, 
nt twice. The students voted on 
hich of the CMU pieces would 
dually be entered. Among those 
ho had entries were Vincent 
(accioli, John Ferris, Jr., Donald 
lexander, Tanya Keith, Michele 
rn, Tony Derossa, and Darren 
Press.
Press winning poster consisted 
f two photographs overlapping 
ich other  one of a homeless 
lan pushing a cart down the 
eet and the other of a homeless 
(an leaning against a building, 
singly looking on. Ironically, 
'ess poster met with some con,versy in the class and had not
course. The professors are really 
competent.
A couple of students want to 
take CFA classes, but cant be
cause of the number of classes 
required for their major. We want 
art classes, says Brian Kim, a 
junior in CIT. We dont get a 
chance to take any CFA classes..
Kwang-HyonPark, another CIT 
junior, agrees with Kim. More 
art classes have to be available to 
CIT students, he says. An art 
student recommended Advanced 
Intermediary to me. The teacher 
is supposed to be incredible.
In fact, many students with 
technical majors want to take CFA 
courses. The classes in CFA seem 
better. Theyre more one-on-one 
and students get more out of 
them, Park says.
Sean Ward, an MCS junior, 
praises Mathematical Methods of 
Physics, taught by professor Hugh 
Young. Its challenging and the 
math is useful for what we do, he 
says.
Jonathon Knight, a fifth year 
H&SS student, lauded Entrepre
neurship, a course offered by 
GSIA. Jack Thorn is one of the 
best professors in the school. The 
information taught is relevant to 
the real world.
Dynamics of Physical Systems 
was recommended by James Horn, 
a senior in CIT. Its really handson stuff. We got to build a working 
model of a crane out of Legos.

in CFA, enjoys Computer Model
ing so much that he recommends 
that every student take it. It eats 
your time up and thats real good, 
he says. Theres nothing like sit
ting in front of a computer eight 
to nine hours for four days 
straight. Its real fun.
William Zachery, a sophomore 
in H&SS, likes his Reading Texts 
class because you get to express 
all the bullshit that youve always 
wanted to say.
Several students recommend a 
physical education class, saying 
its important to get exercise dur)MU students enter 
ocal poster contest 
or the Food Bank
been included in the ones chosen 
to be entered. He decided to enter 
it on his own, despite the opposi
tion. Press second piece, the 
poster chosen by his peers for 
entry in the contest, won an Hon
orable Mention from the panel 
judges, who consisted of various 
experts in the arts. Vincent 
Macciolis two works also received 
Honorable Mentions.
Louise Tullius, who is employed 
at the Food Bank and holds a 
degree in Art from Edinboro Uni
versity, complimented the stu
dents efforts, We were very 
pleased with all of the work en
tered by the students from CMU. 
She also said that Darrens sec
ond place will earn him $75 in 
Gift Certificates and he will be 
honored at the Tenth Anniver
sary commemoration dinner.
Commenting on his prize, 
Darren said, Although my first 
work was met with such mixed 
reactions, I felt strongly enough 
about it to enter it on my own. It 
was really nice to win especially 
when I went with my feelings.
Press work, as well as the other 
winning pieces, are to be displayed 
at the Artery, located at 5847 
Ellsworth. They will be part of an 
exhibit to be shown starting De
cember 6.
ing the school year. I recom
mend volleyball, says CIT 
junior Frank Autenreith.
George Karnage, a sopho
more CIT student who thinks 
a lot about the weather in 
Pittsburgh recommends Any

JAU students at CMU are reWed to buy computers, at least 
[a: Ls what Lisa Birnbach says 
Put Carnegie Mellon Univertion of whether college guide books 
are beneficial or detrimental to 
colleges is pertinent in a society 
that worships guides or manuals 
of any kind.
Many administrators as well as
. --------------------- students agree that the vast maFln her publication titled Lisa jority of high school students aprattack's New & Improved Col& Book.
jjfhis type ofmisinformation has 
jywpted both students and adfflstrators to question the va1 y of many alleged guides to 
fnvP8 ava^a^e 011 the market. [Obviously, students at CMU 
low that owning a computer is 
r ^tely not required and that a 
ajority of students on campus 
B not in fact own computers.
! e cntroversy lies in the fact 
a Scresofhigh school students 
|und the country have read 
! achs words without ever 
jizing that some of the infori. |n ^ ^er book is misleading 
! Natantly incorrect. The quesplying to colleges like CMU refer 
to at least some type of guide book 
in order to help them decide.
In fact, almost any high school 
junior can obtain a plethora of 
guidebooks from his or her coun
seling center in school. The fact 
that so many students read these 
books disturbs some. Sophomore 
architecture major Matt Stafford 
says, [Birnbachs statement 
about computers] blows! It just 
insures that nobody but geeks 
come to school here.
Others do not believe that the 
guidebooks pose such a serious 
threat. John Papinchak, Associ
ate Director of Admissions at 
CMU, believes that most guide
books, such as Petersons, 
Barrons, and the College Board 
Handbookx make standard infor
mation such as S.A.T. scores, size, 
location, and enrollment proce
dures easily accessible to high 
school students. However, 
Papinchak adds, We think 
[guidebooks] provide a good ser
vice if theyre used properly. Its 
important to look at them, but 
with a grain of salt. Our office 
position is that the guides are a 
helpful tool, but they cannot be 
used by themselves.
Ann Greene, assistant to the 
dean of admissions at the Univer
sity of Pennsylvania, agrees with 
Papinchak, The guidebooks can 
give you basic information about 
the school. But you cant expect 
the guidebook to give you a real 
flavor for the university. Any stu
dent needs to visit. No student 
should depend on guidebooks. I 
certainly wouldnt want to rely on 
one of them to decide where I was
going to spend the next four years 
of my life.
The guide books which 
Papinchak and Greene caution 
students about are Bimbachs 
book and also The Fiske Guide to 
Colleges 1991. Fiskes write-up 
about CMU caused quite a bit of 
turmoil among Carnegie Mellon 
students several years ago. Fiske 
stated, Carnegie Mellon remains 
one of the most fragmented cam
puses in the nation. Students di
vide themselves into the fruits 
(actors, dancers, and other artsy 
types) and the veggies (engineers 
and architects). The line became 
somewhat of a joke among stu
dents but spurred university offi
cials to give the 1989 Freshman 
Orientation Week the theme of 
diversity in order to overcome 
such stereotypes among the in
coming freshman class.
Sophomore IDS major Leslie 
Tam says, The line about fruits 
and veggies is really bad. It makes
our campus seem extremely di
vided when its really not. But the 
books have good things too, like 
the interesting places to hangout.
Most of the students The Tartan 
spoke to shared Tams sentiment 
that both Bimbachs and Fiskes 
books had a few glaring errors 
but were, for the most part, accu
rate.
Many students found the books 
accounts of CMU very amusing 
because of both accuracies and 
inaccuracies. There is a portion in 
Bimbachs book which states that 
athletic facilities suck, a state
ment which most CMU students 
would tend to agree with. Some 
students could not help but laugh 
at Birnbachs statements, Dat
ing is big at the monogamousminded school... and The school 
boasts ... the Spartan, Carnegie 
Mellons impressive campus 
newspaper.
All the students The Tartan 
spoke to agreed that Fiskes book
is definitely better than 
Bimbachs. One student quipped, 
How can you entrust your future 
in the hands of Lisa Birnbach, the 
woman who wrote The Official\ 
Preppy Handbook?
Cathy ORourke, associate di
rector of admissions at New York 
University, confirms that Fiskes 
book is better. She says, Fiske 
takes a very different kind of look 
at colleges. He gets input from 
students. Thats somewhat 
unique. There is benefit in read
ing this because the information 
has not been manipulated by the 
administration. Besides, the 
guidebooks tend not to be detri
mental. We tend to come in pretty 
good even with the most opinion
ated ones.
The general consensus is that 
even though misinformation does 
exist in guidebooks, they are a; 
good source of information as long 
as students do not read them as 
though they were sacred.

Urban Assault splashes 
onto the scene as the 
newest survival game
By MIKE SHAPIRO
Tartan Staffwriter
Rocky Palmieri crouches in the 
darkness, cradling his weapon in 
his aims, and allows his head no 
more than two inches exposure 
above the bunkers front wall. As
> scans the void in front of him, 
there is suddenly a shifting in the 
darkness, a barely discemable 
movement without form that 
Palmieri recognizes as an ap
proaching enemy.
Acting instinctively, he swings 
iis gun to eye level and squints 
down the length of the barrel into 
the inky blackness. He tenses his 
arms, jerks the trigger, and hears 
the familiar pop of discharge.
There is a distant thud, then a 
moments silence. By degrees, a 
pool of shadow transforms into a 
standing figure, arms raised high 
above its head. The form turns 
and trundles dispiritedly away, 
and Palmieri grins with the re
alization that he has wasted an
other mug who would have made 
off with his precious flag.
Is this some Vietnam drama 
that was showing on cable last 
Saturday? No. Apsychotic episode 
'of a retired veteran? More argu
able, but still no. This scene oc
curred in a region no more exotic 
than nearby McKees Rocks in the 
Urban Assault Paintball Arena.
Sprawled across an entire 
warehouse floor, Urban Assault 
provides a miniature labyrinth of 
pbstacles and barriers for up to 
twenty people to navigate as they 
ittempt to blast each other with 
an arsenal of paintgun weaponry.
A session lasts three hours, and 
consists of a series of short games, 
ranging from six to fifteen minutes 
each. Typical contests include 
variants on the traditional Cap
ture the Flag genre, and more 
advanced competitions like Route 
61 and The Gauntlet. But they all 
have one thing in common 
theres your team and theres their 
team, and all hell breaks lose 
when the twain meet.
Don your face mask and strap 
on your body armorthose 
paintballs travel at 170 miles an 
hour. You can opt for additional 
accessories like knee pads and 
neck guards if you want, but youd 
better be wearing camouflage 
black or you might as well go in 
naked.
The Arena is an audiovisual 
nightmare. Black lights bathe 
every wall and bunker, making 
the most innocuous of greys glow 
like Three Mile Island. Deafen
ing music booms from above, 
making communications with 
even your own team difficult to 
impossible.
Targeting the enemy while 
wearing your face mask is a chore 
in itself. You can count on your 
protective goggles to fog con
stantly, and you can kiss your 
peripheral vision goodbye as well.
This isnt a romp in your child
hood basement with cap pistols. 
Combat requires a delicate com
bination of instinct and skill 
instinct so that you can pick out 
members of the opposition who 
skulk through the shadows, and 
skill so you can successfully bring 
your weapon to bear and bathe

Your paintgun, an unwieldy 
metal annoyance when youre 
suiting up in the lobby, becomes 
your best friend in the field. You 
can bring a standard Splatmaster 
pistol with you into battle, or, if 
you feel more daring, take along a 
rapid firing Warrior or Phantom 
rifle instead. The weapons run on 
C02 cartridges and are fairly 
complicated, so be ready to deal 
with all the sundry details of com
bat, such as reloading and avoid
ing barrel jams that never seemed 
to bother John Wayne in The 
Longest Day.
If you blast an adversaryor 
an unfortunate teammatehell 
be banished from the Arena until 
the next game. But if you yourself
get nailed, be prepared to endure 
the embarrassment of trudging 
back to the lobby, hands raised 
high, while periodically shouting 
hit! above the din so that you 
arent inadvertently pelted on 
your way out.
Safety is certainly an issue, as 
is clear from the disclaimers that 
every participant is required to 
sign at the outset, and the staff of 
Urban Assault have strict regula
tions to prevent you from driving 
home with one of your eyes in 
your pocket. Goggles and protec
tive headgear ar e worn at all times 
during games, and headshots or 
attacks at point blank range are 
illegal. Dont expect your clothes 
to enjoy such concern for their

Tartan Asst. Diversions Editor
What kind of place is La Cage Aux 
Folles? If you dont know already, youre 
in for quite a surprise.
La Cage Aux Folles is a French night 
club, a pleasure palace, a haven for both 
drag queens and show girls and anyone 
else desiring to live life on an angle.
La Cage Aux Folles is the kind of place 
where you can let go of your inhibitions, 
the kind of place where you can experi
ence something very different, the kind 
of place where every kick, stomp and 
swish is met with the clash of a cymbal, 
the beat of a drum, or the whistle of a 
flute.
La Cage Aux Folles is owned and oper
ated by two men, one transvestite ho
mosexual and one plain homosexual. 
The latter, Georges, acts as emcee to the 
evenings performances. His faithful 
companion of twenty years, Albin, takes 
the stage as the clubs top attraction, Za 
Za.
Due to a one night stand almost twentyfive years ago, Georges has a son, JeanMichel, who plans to marry the girl of his

dreams, Anne. The only problem is that 
her father is a deputy who has made it 
his personal pledge to shut down the 
notorious establishments like La Cage 
Aux Folles. Before Annes parents will 
approve of the marriage, they want to 
meet Jean-Michels family. Georges can 
easily pass even the most diligent in
spection, but the innocent and wildly 
flamboyant Albin has to take lessons on 
being macho.
As Albin, Allan Stevens gives the kind 
of performance that most actors could 
only dream of achieving. While attempt
ing to be the kind of man that Annes 
parents would want in the family, he lets
Albins true character show through iri 
hundreds of ways that are so natural you 
could hardly imagine Stevens without 
the flouncy walk and falsetto voice.
While Albin allows himself to b6 
changed for his love of Jean-Michel, he 
does let go with a passionate, infuriated 
solo I am what I am. Stevens brings the 
house to tears as he cries, So what if I 
love each feather and each spangle/ Why 
not try to see things from a different 
angle?
Dennis Kelly gives a delightful perfor
mance as Georges. Not only does he lead 
the audience through each night at La 
Cage Aux Folles, he also acts a mediator 
between Albin and Jean-Michel. His most 
touching moments, however, are when 
he serenades Albin with Song on the 
Sand, an explanation of how Albin still 
sets his heart aflame after all their years 
together.
Tome Cousin portrays the crowdpleasing Jacob, an individual among in
dividuals. Jacob (who prefers to be called 
Claudine) must content himself with 
working as maid to Georges and Albin 
until he can persuade Georges to give

Back in 1977, Martin Mull, Fred

tude that was lacking in Mike 
Douglas and Dinah Shore. The 
production quality was (purpose
fully) low, but the show was funny
 and very weird. (By the way, 
repeats of Fernwood 2Night can 
be found on Nickelodeon weeknights at 10:30 pm.)
Fast-forward to 1990. Someone 
somewhere comes up with a bril
liant idea  an updated version 
of Fernwood 2Night. And so My 
Talk Show is bom.
Cynthia Stevenson portrays 
Jennifer Bass, a normal person 
who has been broadcasting a talk 
show from her living room on the 
local UHF station in Derby, Wis
consin.
Suddenly, and for no apparent 
reason, the show goes national in 
September 1990. Jennifer takes 
it in stride, letting her friends 
remain on the show while at the 
same time improving the caliber 
of her guests.
Jennifer is supposed to be an 
average American given an op
portunity a lot of us dream of 
her own nationwide talk show.
The level of dialogue here is insulting 
to a four-year-old.
Unfortunately, in an attempt to 
make her average, the producers 
have also made her boring. She 
says hello, says goodbye, smiles 
at the audience, and periodically 
asks an incredibly stupid ques
tion. Her charming, small-town 
innocence really begins to grate 
after a while.
Her sidekick, Angela Davenport 
(Stephanie Hodge), is Jennifers 
loud and obnoxious next-door 
neighbor. Shes completely 
wrapped up in herself and pre
tends to know a lot, although she 
probably hasnt wandered too far 
from Derby in her lifetime.
The guest on the show I viewed 
was record producer Frank DiLeo, 
who has a role in the movie 
GoodFellas. At the beginning of 
the program, Jennifer and Angela 
take some time for happy talk, 
and get onto the subject of 
GoodFellas. Turns out Jennifer 
hasnt seen the film because she 
doesnt like blood. But its only 
ketchup, scolds Angela. The dis
cussion eventually leads to this; 
gem: Angela says, Well, if your 
ketchup doesnt look like blood,; 
then theres something wrong 
with your ketchup! Arguably the; 
funniest line in the show.
DiLeo comes out, makes a joke; 
about the ketchup stain on his; 
shirt (yes, the ketchup/blood joke; 
becomes a central theme here,; 
dragged into the ground by the! 
shows end), shows a clip from', 
GoodFellas, and acts stupid. Then!

What will the future be like? 
For years, writers of all genres 
have been answering that ques
tion in hundreds of different ways. 
Ah, but youve seen it all before,

tidal waves to wipe the slate clean 
and teach those egocentric jeanclad diploid buggers a lesson in 
respect, thats what!
Evidently, thats exactly what 
happened to those nutty humans 
in Xenozoic Tales. After a trau
matic cataclysm of unimaginable 
proportions, most of mankind has 
been wiped out. A handful of hu
mans who survived the revamp
ing of the Earth have come out 
after six generations of hiding out 
underground, and established 
civilization once again amidst the 
haunting ruins of 20th century 
architecture. No countries exist 
any more. Humanity now con
sists of a bunch of scattered tribes.
And thats not the only thing 
thats different. Humanity is no 
longer at the top of the food chain
 it now has to compete with 
dinosaurs!
Forget worrying about the birds 
messing up the sidewalk, now 
youve gotta worry about ptero
dactyls. Rome has got to be the 
smelliest place on this future 
Earth, thats for sure! No more 
family picnics, geez, in this world 
the family is the picnic! Har!
The atmosphere created by 
Xenozoic Tales exaggerates the 
relationship between man and 
nature to the point where the 
subtle becomes obvious. In this 
world, man is just another multicellular organism, subject to the 
same laws of parasitism, mutual
ism, and communalism as other 
animals. Writer Mark Schultz 
goes to great lengths to structure 
the world so that there is a sense 
of balance. Dinosaurs have teeth, 
and people still have guns. The 
presence of weapons in this world 
serves to set the stage for many 
interesting conflicts in which the 
nature of the balance of nature is 
the central theme.
Regardless of how interesting 
the background may be, no book 
can truly succeed without a rich 
pool of characters to make the 
stories work. The hero of this fu
ture world is Jack Tenrec, part 
Indiana Jones, partTarzan, and 
part Cooter, the fuzzy mechanic

from Dukes ofHazzard. Hes kind 
of like the town sheriff, environ
mentalist, and protector of all 
creatures great and small all 
rolled up into one Caucasian 
crepe.
Jacks also the owner of the most 
sophisticated piece of machinery 
in this world of tomorrow; a revved 
up, four-wheel-drive, all-terrain 
1950 Cadillac convertible. Our pal 
asks for nothing in return except 
spare parts for his baby.
Then theres Hannah Dundee, 
ambassador from the tribe of the 
Wassoon. Shes a level-headed, 
resourceful, black-maned gal on a 
diplomatic mission to Jacks tribe, 
which is located somewhere near 
Manhattan. Hannah serves as our 
eyes and ears in Jacks world: We
learn about him and his ethics 
from her adventures with him. 
Shes the doorway to the plots 
about human interactions and 
politics as well, and probably the 
character you will find yourself 
identifying with the most.
Hannah and Jack, along with 
an interesting cast of supporting 
characters, give Schultz world of 
Cadillacs and dinosaurs a depth 
and dimension that not many 
other alternate world stories have.
From an artistic point of view, 
this book is superb. Schultzs art 
is detailed and dense. He has a 
wonderful sense of texture and is 
especially strong in establishing 
picturesque, wide-angle scenes. 
The art, as well as the writing, 
have a nostalgic fifties feel that
gives the book a dreamy, timeless 
quality. The book is top-notch and 
has been nominated for several 
awards since it came out.
The only major problem with 
this independent comic is its in
frequency. The last new issue 
came out last spring, and such a 
fragmented publishing schedule 
hurts it terribly. There is a way 
around that for new readers, 
thoughin fact there are a couple 
of ways.
One is a collected hardback that 
allows you to read several issues 
all at once. This is probably the 
most convenient way for anyone 
to get access to this book, although 
it is a little expensive.
Another route is to catch the 
monthly reprints from Epic 
Comics. The reprints are titled 
Cadillacs and Dinosaurs and re 
presented in color, a great bonus 
to readers new and old since the 
original series is in black and 
white.
And one final option is, if yoifre 
illiterate, to wait for some Holly
wood producer to make this book 
into a movie. Just a thought.

Adopt a copy of Skinny Puppys latest LP Too Dark Park

pop to mind when hearing Con
vulsions or Tormentor.
The aforementioned two audio 
sculpture pieces give the LP a 
good beginning, relying on the 
same tricks used on previous 
Skinny Puppy LPs: lots of syn
thesized drum, lots of distorted 
voice-overs, lots of distortion in 
general, and an extremely harsh 
overall tone.
Like the title suggests, Tor
mentor creates mental images of 
someone tormenting or someone 
being tormented. However, Tor
mentor is almost subtle com
pared to Convulsions.The drum 
track is less pronounced and the 
melody, which is similar to the 
one in Convulsions, comes 
through much nicer.
But neither of the next two 
pieces, Spasmolytic and Rash 
Reflection, can be thought of as 
subtle. Rash Reflection is diffi
cult to understand, even by 
Skinny Puppy standards.
The last song on side one, titled
Natures Revenge, is somewhat 
surprising in the fact that it has a 
hauntingly sad melody. The last 
line sounds like, Scared? You 
really are? Its almost as if Skinny 
Puppy were trying to say, Hey 
look, this groups not all hard edge 
and synthesizers, weve got feel
ings and a sensitive side, too. 
Nah, couldnt be.
Shoreline Poison, from the 
second side of the LP, starts off 
sounding like the string section 
from an orchestra and works its 
way into a highly distorted drum 
beat. Throughout the rest of the 
song, it seems as if the classical 
stringtheme is trying to be heard, 
but gets drowned out by every
thing else.
It's almost as if Skinny Puppy were 
trying to say; Hey look, this group's 
not all hard edge and synthesizers, 
weve got feelings and a sensitive 
side, too.
The next song, Grave Wisdom, 
is the most focused song on the 
album. Not-un-til-they-aredead, is repeated quite a few 
times along with some other lines 
which are pretty much indis
cernible. The whole song is played 
in a minor key with lots of dis
cordant notes.
The next song is titled, 
T.F.W.O. Why? Who knows?
Its really strange, which is 
about all that can be said about it.
Morpheus Laughing, how
ever, has lots that can be said 
about it. It sounds like a 
soundtrack from a sci-fi horror 
flick with Darth Vaders hyperac
tive nephew on speed doing a nar
rative on the futility of life. Then 
again, it might not. It depends bn 
your point of view.
The last song, Reclamation, 
provides a suitable ending for tjie 
album. It has very few words, yet 
it manages to convey a sense!of 
finality that many songs lack. All 
this in only three minutes  the 
shortest piece on Too Dark Park.
Skinny Puppy is definitely riot 
party music, unless you throw

In 1782, in the court of Emperor Joseph II, a brash young composer named Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart set the music world on its ear. A radical departure from the current fashion in music, he set a new standard for style and composition.
It has always been sothe old guard surpassed by 
a new wave. Today, Cadence is breaking with the conventional order as we pioneer a new way of designing the next generation of electronic products. Its called Electronic Product Development Automation (EPDA) and, led by Cadence, its the direction the industry is heading. Automation on a task by task basis was good enough for the last decade; the 1990s call for automation beyond that level. Designers need a process that encompasses the total product development cycle.
EPDA represents Cadences vision of how product design needs to be done in the 1990s. Were already an established leader in supplying what 
designers need at the Electronic Design Automation (EDA) stage of product development thanks to our pioneering Design Framework 11 architecture and 
the high-performance suite of tools based on that integrated system. Our aim for the coming decade is to leverage our proven EDA technology to offer a complete, integrated EPDA solution.
But EPDA is more than just a technological vision. Cadences long-standing philosophies of openness, software portability, support of industry standards,
and cooperation with other technology innovators also play a key role in our drive toward providing a total solution and set ours apart from traditional approaches.
What all this means for you is the opportunity to join the vanguard of design automation. You can 
begin contributing your ideas from day one, as you participate in a creative process infused with intelligence, enthusiasm, and personal commitment.
When you begin your job search, consider Cadence. And if you're graduating in any of the following areas, dont miss our on-campus jam session and interviews.

Get the proton pack ready  Ghostbusters is here
Youve seen the movie, watched 
the TV show, and eaten the 
breakfast cereal  and now you 
can play game. Thats right, 
iow you can call the Ghostbusters 
)n your Genesis entertainment 
system.
Believe it or not, this version of 
Ghostbusters has taken almost 
qo elements from the last two 
piovies. True, the Stay-Puft 
yjarshmallow Man makes an 
appearance, as well as the ghost 
jlimer, but other than these two 
fellows (and the Ghostbusters 
ihemselves) this game is surjrisingly original. In matter of 
act, if Sega wanted to, it probably 
iould have saved a lot of money by 
jot purchasing the rights to 
ghostbusters and just come out 
vith the same game under a dif
ferent name.
Anyhow, as if you couldnt guess, 
he main goal of this game is to 
)Ust ghosts. But before you go 
:harging up your proton pack, 
you have to choose which characer you wish to play. Your choices 
onsist of Peter, Raymond, or Egon 
why isnt Winston included?), 
rhere is a small difference beween each characters speed and
PRESS START
by Stephen Glicker
stamina, but basically theyre all 
the same. After youve selected 
your character you better get that 
proton pack ready  its 
showtime!
In the beginning of the game 
you have four ghost-infested 
buildings to choose from: A sweet 
little home infested with polter
geists, an apartment which for 
some reason is frozen like an ice 
cube, a large wooden house cur
rently engulfed in flames, and a 
high-rise building filled with wa
ter.
In order to complete each 
building you have to first navigate 
through and around several small, 
pitiful ghosts, then get rid of two 
or three middle ghosts (ghosts 
which are fairly powerful and 
usually do a good job of weaken
ing you), and then finally get rid 
of the boss ghost (a really nasty 
guy). Only then can you call the 
building ghost-free.
Your reward for this taxing job 
is what any hard working 
Ghostbuster should expect  
money. However, dont go run
ning to the bank just yet, for you 
know what they sayeasy come, 
easy go (and go it does).
You see, right down the street 
is a convenient item shop, where 
you can buy things such as bombs 
andinfrared scopes, and a weapon 
shop which carries the standard 
fare  energy tanks, bubble pro
jectiles, phaser shells, 3-way 
shots, special suits  the kind of 
stuff you would find in any old 
weapon shop. Anyhow, this stuff 
is all really expensive and, of 
course, necessary if you want to 
win the game.
Also, after you liquidate the 
boss ghost you will find a piece 
of a mysterious stone tablet. Get 
four of these tablets and you can 
solve the riddle why the city has 
become infected with ghosts, as 
well as take a trip to two new 
huge levels  a haunted house 
and the ghost capital of the uni
verse, where youll need all of 
that expensive equipment if want 
to survive.
As for the graphics and sound, 
Ghostbusters excels. Music and 
visuals are also top-notch. Each 
level is a complete world unto, 
itself, with a unique personality 
that is consistent throughout the 
building.
Take for example the frozen 
apartment. In this level the main 
boss ghost consists of a killer 
snowman who throws deadly 
carrot noses at you. And when 
your ghostbuster takes a breath 
on this level, you can see it.
Or take the home sweet home 
level, which is infested with pol
tergeists. Cups, saucers, knifes, 
and forks dance around the place 
and attack you, trying to make 
you their next meal. Tables float 
everywhere and tablecloths come 
to life and try to smother you. 
Even the chandeliers arent safe 
on this level.
One can easily see by playing, 
or even looking at this game, that 
Sega has gone through a lot of 
trouble to make the graphics in 
Ghostbusters as detailed and re
alistic as possible.

The music probably could have 
sounded a bit better, but at least 
it does something that a lot of 
other games dont easily accom
plish  its enjoyable to listen to. 
Each level has its own music and 
I have yet to become bored with 
any one levels music after months 
of playing.
As for game play, it isnt all that 
difficult, but its still difficult
enough. Even on the easy level 
this game takes a good hour of so 
to solve. Its also probably a good 
thing to mention the fact that 
Ghostbusters has a continue fea
ture which will allow you to con
tinue playing after you die. How
ever, it only works nine times, so 
you still have to be careful.
So, even if you never saw the 
movie, found the TV show to be 
silly, or thought that the breakfast 
cereal was just plain too soggy, 
buy Ghostbusters. Its probably 
the best looking game currently 
available for the Genesis and 
definitely one of the best overall.
For the final evaluation, on. a 
scale of one to ten, I give t}he 
graphics a nine, the sound a)nd 
music an eight, the playability !an 
eight, and the originality a nrfre. 
Overall I give Ghostbusters n 
eight and a half.
Tune in next week and find cjut 
what new game Ive wasted ijiy 
money on.

remarkable work keeps the au
dience laughing no matter how 
sad the story gets.
In the part of Jean-Michel, Brett 
Kennedy must play the straight 
man in more ways than one. As 
one of the rare heterosexuals, 
Kennedy is allowed few great 
lines, but he does keep his charac
ter lively through this difficult 
position.
As wonderful as the cast and 
the story of their characters lives 
are, this show is at its gaudy, 
racy, hysterical best during the 
clubs numbers, which include a 
fabulous can-can dance by a few 
of Les Cagelles. Other unforget
table moments include the song 
Masculinity, in which the shows 
men try to teach Albin all the 
proper male movements, and the 
spirited number The Best of 
Times.
But the greatest thing about 
this show is that the message it 
delivers comes with lots of laugh
ter. This musical is not about the
plight of homosexuals or trans
vestites. It is simply a play aboiit 
differences and the need for ev
eryone to celebrate their ownliv^s

So, what kind of play is La Cage

audience is left on its feet, ap

It brings out the best in all of us.

 Of these substance-lacking films

 Metropolitan is a comedy/

such as Tom Townsend (Edward 
' Clements) show off their dashing 
expensive tuxedos, all of which 
are rented. Everyone involved 
portrays someone he or she really 
isnt.
1 The movie chronicles the life 
and times of a group of young 
Park Avenue socialites who 
gather nightly to discuss their 
lives, their view of honor, and the 
slow demise of young arrogant 
snobs like themselves. Damn, 
there goes the market for caviar!
Breaking into the circle of

leader Nick Smith (Christopher 
Eigeman) and the charmless but 
well-dressed Audrey Rouget 
(Carolyn Farina). After all, for 
public appearances it is absolutely 
necessary for an uppercrust fe
male to have a handsome man at 
her side  even if he doesnt have 
an American Express gold card.
Other members of the group 
include Charlie Spengler (Taylor 
Nichols), who does everything but 
plant kisses on Audreys derriere 
to catch her attention; Cynthia 
McLean (Isabel Gillies), the 
groups budding Marilyn Monroe; 
Jane Clarke (Allison RutledgeParisi), the judgmental and pre
cocious member of the group (aka 
bitch); Sally Fowler (Dylan 
Hundley), the hostess of all the 
groups philosophical discussions; 
and Fred Neff (Bryan Leder), who 
spends most of his time wisely 
catching up on sleep during dis
cussions.
While the group holds heated 
debates on which New York res
taurant serves the best filet mignon, Audrey finds herself falling 
in love with Tom. However, Toms 
heart has been snatched away in 
his prom years by sophisticated 
debutante of the year, Serena 
Slocum (ElizabethThompson). He 
claims that he is no longer at
tracted to her, but he thinks of 
little else. When Serena begins to 
return Toms affection, Tom be
comes more comfortable with the
flashy world he has been drawn 
into.
The plot simply doesnt work. 
The characters are stereotypical 
and the style of the film is a rerun. 
In past years, we have seen mov
ies about social climbers and the 
various problems of those whose 
wallets are always filled with 
cash.
These films include Less Than 
Zero and almost every John 
Hughes/Molly Ringwald movie 
ever made. The rich versus the 
poor versus who has the most 
expensive Chanel suit has become 
almost as lame as the disease-ofthe-week dramas on television.
The film also attempts to focus 
exclusively on the members of the 
social group. This idea worked 
only once before* in the film The 
Breakfast Club. Let us make some 
comparisons:
First of all, The Breakfast Club 
had some very talented actors and 
actresses. The Metropolitan cast 
consists of first-time movie actors 
who look as if they want to go 
back into their trailers and drink 
throughout the entire movie. The 
directors should have provided 
several happy hours before al
lowing such cast members as Ed
ward Clements and Carolyn Fa
rina to act like limp linguini on 
the big screen.
Also, The Breakfast Club deals 
with one setting  a school li
brary. It is easier with this set
ting to go into depth with char
acter analysis.
The settinginMetropolitan gets 
too complex with the apartment 
scenes, the morbidly boring cab

ment complex is filled with urban atmosphere, the 
usual daily grind  but there is something highly 
unusual about the couple living across the courtyard. 
Stewart quickly turns amateur detective and his 
obsession rubs off on his companion, Grace Kelly.
So, keep your eyes open for the director himself, 
and dont miss a second of this superbly crafted film.

Die Hard II
Terrorists have shut down the control tower of 
Dulles Airport; half a dozen planes are circling, 
waiting to drop out of the sky when their fuel runs 
out. Who can save the day? Coincidentally, super 
cop John McClane (Bruce Willis) happens to be at 
the airport to pick up his wife when the terrorists 
hit, so it naturally falls on him to rescue the innocent. 
While not as good as the original, Die Hard II packs 
a lot of action between the opening and closing 
credits. The only problem is that Willis is no longer 
the common man trapped in an uncommon situa
tion, but rather some sort of psychic cop who un
derstands exactly whats going on but has to work 
around the incompetents aroundhim. Bonnie Bedeha 
and William Atherton return as McClanes wife and 
sleaze reporter Dick Thornburgh, respectively; the 
two are accidentally flying on the same endangered 
plane. Check it out  if not for the action, then for 
the special effects.

Bird on a Wire
Hollywood yet again delivers a standard plot to 
the movie-going audience  someones trying to kill 
this guy, he bumps into his ex-wife who thought that 
hes was dead for the last few years or so, but now the 
bad guys are trying to kill both of them, so now they 
must both escape death while at the same time 
having the biggest adventure of their lives. Some 
Hollywood executives put two really big stars, Goldie 
Hawn and Mel Gibson, in Bird on a Wire, crossed their 
fingers, and hoped that it would work  and sur
prisingly enough it did.
Even though the critics panned this movie for 
being another generic action adventure, Hawn and 
Gibson really do add a lot to this film, and some of the 
adventure scenes are pretty amazing. If you like 
Hawn or Gibson, then go see this film. If you just like 
adventure, but not Hawn or Gibson, then you might 
want to miss it.

Blazing Saddles
While Blazing Saddles will hardly be mentioned 
hi the same breath with historys greatest movies, 
this Mel Brooks comedy is a film everyone should 
see. At the same time Brooks reverently recreates 
the look of Hollywood westerns, he rips them apart 
with one-liners and physical humor. Attorney gen
eral Hedley Lamar wants to drive the citizens out of 
Rock Ridge so he can cheaply buy the land before the 
railroad is built through the town. He hires Cleavon 
Little to be the sheriff of Rock Ridge, hoping that the 
townspeople will be so offended by a black sheriff 
that theyll leave. However, Little, with the help of 
the Waco Kid, a washed-up gunfighter played by
ene Wilder, wins over the town and drives the bad 
SHys away. Although the humor is on the level of the 
average fourth-grader, Blazing Saddles is worth a look.
