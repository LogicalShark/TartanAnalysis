Really the only three things I do are 
chool, work, and SDC, Student Dornitory Council (SDC) President 
tiichael Sperger said of his resignaion. School was non-negotiable, work 
vasnon-negotiable, so SDC had to go.
Citing increased academic pres
tares, Sperger made the announcenent Wednesday that he will resign 
it the end of the semester.
I am graduating next August, which
is nearly a year ahead of sched
ule, the junior English major 
said. Because I am trying to 
graduate early, I will be se
verely overloading. Academics 
will have to come first for me, 
he explained.
Its my opinion that hes done 
an excellent job for the organi
zation, said SDCs Secretary of 
the Treasury Brendan Dunham. 
Hes gotten us to see our goals 
and initiatives in a way that I 
havent seen before.
While he was surprised at the 
announcement, Dunham said, I 
know that he wouldnt be doing 
this if it wasnt absolutely neces
sary. 
I'm not surprised, said SDC 
Vice President Sonia Chandra. 
Mike had already discussed [with me] 
the fact that he was resigning before he 
had announced it, so I wasn't surprised 
when he did announce it.
Ive been giving the idea some 
thought all semester ... [but] I dont 
think that this has to hurt the organi
zation, Sperger said. Weve faced a 
lot of challenges in the past year and 
without fail weve taken them on and 
even performed better than I ex
pected.

By ANNE RAY

According to the recent 
yU1Iue11'eeS magazine rankings of 
Masters of Business Administration 
(MBA) programs, Carnegie Mellons 
Graduate School of Industrial Admin
istration (GSIA) 
slipped from its 
previous ranking 
of 14th to 17th.
The survey was 
based on ques
tionnaires given 
to recruiters and 
graduates of the 
masters degree 
programs from ~ 
each school. These
two categories were averaged, and a 
composite ranking given. In the 
graduate category, GSIA ranked 5th, - 
and ranked 26th in the corporate 
category. The questionnaires also 
asked the recruiters and graduates 
to give the school grades in specific 
areas like teaching, curriculum, and 
placement.
Ilker Baybars, the deputy dean 
of GSIA, said that it is important
to look at the survey from the posi
tions of both the MBAs and the re
cruiters.
It is true that we have slipped 
from the corporate perspective, said 
Baybars. But when we look at the 
whole study, were actually doing very 
well. We are one of the five schools

which got all As from graduates. 
Were [ranked] number one in Opera
tions, number nine in Finance. 
According to yU1Iue11'eeS/ Opera
tions and Finance are two specific 
skills that recruiters look for when 
hiring, and GSIA is one of their fa
vorite hunting grounds. GSIA ranks 
above MIT, Michigan, Cornell, and 
Harvard for Operations, all of which 
are larger schools with more exten
sive alumni networks.
Size is very important in the cor
porate rankings, said Baybars. At 
Carnegie Mellon theres no law, 
theres no medicine, theres no big 
basketball team. Harvard puts out 
900 new MBAs every five years. The 
number of alumni for us is 4,300 
over 50 years. 
Wharton has 46 
professors just in 
Finance. GSIA has 
nine. Why do we 
feel we are better 
quality? We ask 
the question: are 
our masters stu
dents being hired? 
Are they getting 
good jobs, good 
pay? The answer is a big yes. 
Rich Oprison, a second-year stu
dent in GSIA, said that part of the 
problem with the rankings is GSIAs 
visibility factor.
Even in Pittsburgh we have a 
visibility problem. I think that the 
problem is that the corporations that 
come here to recruit are not the 
companies that are answering the

PITTSBURGH, October, 18 
AP)  A controversial coroner 
las derailed the trial of two white 
lolicemen charged in the suffoation of a black motorist, simply 
)y saying an officer should tell 
urors what he did.
Ajudge angrily declared a misrial Friday after Dr. Cyril Wecht 
estified for the prosecution in 
'he case against suburban PittsJurgh police Lieutenant Milton 
Mulholland and Officer Michael 
Albert in the death of Jonny 
Sammage.
.The officers were among five 
ivhofought Gammage on October
12,1995, after he emerged from a 
Jaguar carrying a cellular phone 
that police said they thought was 
a gun. Police subdued him by 
pressing on his back and neck; 
the pressure killed him.
The fight was compared to the 
Rodney King beating and de
scribed by the Reverend Jesse 
Jackson as a lynching.
Mulholland and Albert are 
charged with involuntary man
slaughter, which is punishable 
by five years in prison. They say 
they followed their training in 
controlling Gammage and did not 
know their method could kill him.
State Judge David Cashman 
said that jurors could not have 
ignored Wechts testimony that 
Mulholland should testify about 
his fight with Gammage, 31, a 
cousin of Pittsburgh Steelers de
fensive end Ray Seals.
What am I supposed to tell the 
jury? Am I supposed to tell them 
to disregard that statement? You 
cant tell folks not to look at a blue 
elephant, and this is a blue el
ephant, Cashman said.
The exchange between defense 
attorney Patrick Thomassey and 
Wecht on Thursday went like this: 
Thomassey: You tell me what
my client did. Tell me. what my 
client did from A to Z.
Wecht: No, its not for me to tell 
you what your client did. Its for 
the client to .tell me, the ladies and 
gentlemen of the jury, what he 
did, what he was doing there and 
why he was participating in this. 
Constitutional law guarantees 
that defendants need not testify 
at their trials because the pros
ecution has the burden of proving 
guilt. Defense attorneys sug
gested their clients were going to 
take the stand anyway.
Wecht appeared Friday night 
on WPXI-TV, where he said he
was frustrated by Cashmans de
cision but insisted he had done 
nothing wrong.
I dont feel on the defensive 
about this at all. Let me make 
that very clear, Wecht said. Ive 
done nothing that as far as Im 
concerned is improper, unethi
cal. And I will say that whether 
anybody likes it or not.
Defense attorney Tom Ceraso 
suggested Wecht, who has criti
cized the selection of an all-white 
jury, purposely caused the mis
trial. He said Wecht has a law 
degree, oversees inquests in his 
role as coroner and knew the sig
nificance of his remark.
Allegheny County Deputy Dis
trict Attorney Anthony Krastek 
said Wechts comment was inap
propriate but may have been pro
voked by Thomasseys aggressive 
questioning.
Wecht, 65, who enjoys media 
attention, was in private practice 
when Gammages relatives hired 
him for $2,500 to examine the 
body in their hometown of Syra
cuse, N.Y. He was elected as coro
ner last year.
His testimony augmented that

Japan faces economic 
woes, elections affected
TOKYO, Oct. 16 (AP)  Anemic 
growth. A ballooning budget deficit. 
Lagging productivity. Five years ago, 
few Japanese could have dreamed that 
those would be the key phrases de
scribing their economy in 1996.
Despite the economic woes, polls on 
the eve of a parliamentary election 
indicate Japans prime minister will 
be re-elected Sunday and that his con
servative party will emerge with 
greater control over Parliament.
One reason is that his opponents 
havent convinced voters they can en
sure a brighter future. But it also could 
be that Japan Inc. just isnt ready for 
the painful restructuring it needs.
Japans slow recovery is nothing like 
the ones in the old days, when Japan 
would easily ride out blips in business 
and zoom on again at annual growth 
rates of five percent to 10 percent.
Growth this year in the gross do
mestic product, the sum of goods and 
services produced in Japan, is expected 
to barely top two percent. .Even more 
striking, many private economists ex
pect growth next year to fall below two 
percent again.
Japan has also found itself lagging 
behind the United States in key growth 
areas of computer and related tech
nology even as other east Asian com
petitors challenge Japanese leaders 
in the car and electronics markets.
Whats more, Japan suffers from a 
huge annual budget deficit of $180 
billion. When measured against the 
size of its economy, Japans budget 
deficit is more than twice as large as
the much-discussed U.S. deficit.
So much for the idea of a Japan poised 
to seize world economic supremacy.
The uncertain economic future has 
been reflected in the campaign for 
elections that will choose the powerful 
lower house of Parliament. Prime Min
ister Ryutaro Hashimoto and other 
politicians are promising to slash gov
ernment bureaucracy, partly to cut 
the budget deficit and partly to elimi
nate regulations that protect favored 
industries and keep productivity low.
Opposition parties have denounced 
the planned tax increase the biggest 
group has offered a giant $160 billion 
tax cutbut none are giving specifics 
on where savings should come from.
Hashimoto is heavily favored to keep 
his job because the fractured opposi
tion appears to have failed to convince 
many voters that it represents change.
Experts say its Japans weak growth 
in productivity that has kept the 
economy in the doldrums. Farmers 
continue growing rice and vegetables 
on tiny plots with heavy government 
subsidies, and Japans productivity in 
services is estimated at little more 
than half the U.S. level.
But it would mean a social transfor
mation for Japanese who assumed they 
had secure jobs to be told outright they 
were fired  something that almost 
never happens at big companies now.
Thats the flip side of the slow recov
ery; we havent seen inequality and lay
offs, said Andrew Shipley, an economist 
at Schrders Japan. The Japanese are 
sacrificing growth for stability.
Buchanan says Republican 
majority hinges on Dole
NASHVILLE, Tenn., Oct. 18 (AP) 
The Republican Partys congressional 
majority hinges on how close Senator 
Bob Dole finishes in next months presi
dential election, conservative commen
tator Pat Buchanan said Friday.
Buchanan called on Dole and Re
publican surrogates to become aggres
sively offensive if they expect to close 
the gap between Clinton and Dole.
I think the battle for the House is no 
where near decided for right now, and 
its largely contingent on the margin 
of the presidential race. Thats why I 
urge every Republican out there  I 
know some are disappointed in Sena
tor Dole and some are a little down in 
the mouthto unite, Buchanan said.
Go out there and work, fight as 
hard as we can, narrow the margin. If 
Senator Dole comes within five points 
or seven points or wins, we keep both 
houses, Buchanan said.
The Congress of the United States, 
as of right now, will probably go Re
publican.
He said the House is more vulner
able than the Senate.
Buchanan, a Republican presiden
tial hopeful in the primaries this year, 
said the GOP failed to attack Clinton 
strongly enough in the days after, the 
partys convention last summer.
I do believe the party, in these last 
three weeks ... should go on the offen
sive and explain to the American people 
why Clinton and Clinton do not de
serve a second term, that their record 
and ethical standards both bear total 
repudiation by the American people, 
Buchanan said.
Buchanan appeared during a lunch 
time news conference with Steve 
Edmondson, who is opposing Repre
sentative Bob Clement for the 5th Dis
trict congressional seat.
Russia gives war 
crime info to US
MOSCOW, Oct. 18 (AP)  Russias 
Federal Security Service (FSS) will turn 
over more than 14,000 pages of Nazi war 
crime documents to the United States, 
the Interfax news agency reported on 
Friday.
President Boris Yeltsin has authorized 
the agency to send the documents to the 
Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C., 
Nikolai Kovalyov, director of the secu
rity service, told Interfax.
In line with this letter, the tJ.S. gov
ernment and the U.S. people will receive 
copies of documents from the FSS cen
tral archives disclosing fascist crimes 
during World War II, and in particular 
concerning the mass extermination of 
Jews, Russian prisoners of war, and 
representatives of other nationalities, 
Kovalyov was quoted as saying.
Submarine base 
hosts Secretary
SEVERODVINSK, Russia, Oct. 18 
(AP)Defense Secretary Wilham Perry 
today visited the once top-secret Little 
Star submarine shipyard to observe Cold 
War-era ballistic missile submarines be
ing cut up, smashed, and turned into 
scrap metal.
Perry praised the Russians skill and 
hard work, which has combined with 
U.S. machinery to destroy submarines 
under the Start I arms treaty.
You can be very proud of that. We 
faced the danger of a nuclear holo
caust that hung over our heads like a 
dark cloud. Now with the end of the 
Cold War, that cloud is drifting away, 
Perry said.
Perry, who kept to his schedule de
spite the turmoil in Moscow over the 
firing of Alexander Lebed, was due back 
in Washington Friday night. The De
fense Secretarys trip to Russia coin
cided with President Boris Yeltsins 
ouster of the former general, who Yeltsin 
accused of excessive ambition and out
spokenness.
Today, Perry watched as crews with 
blowtorches cut up a 400-foot Yankee 
Class submarine that was rusting in dry 
dock. The submarine had once patrolled 
off U.S. shores, said Senator Sam Nunn, 
D-Georgia, who traveled with Perry to 
the site 180 miles south of the Arctic 
Circle.
That sub had its missiles trained on 
U.S. cities, Nunn said. U.S. equipment 
has been provided to the workers at the 
base to help in their efforts to destroy 
two submarines a year.
Perry and his entourage heard the 
clank and crash of scrap metal as it was 
smashed in a guillotine-like machine 
made by a company from Georgia.
Elsewhere on the base, Perry observed 
a copper shredder from Texas that turned 
copper wire from the subs into copper 
pellets for reuse in industry.
Perrys visit marked the first time 
that foreign journalists and photogra
phers were allowed at the base, a major 
production facility for the former Soviet 
Unions strategic ballistic missile sub
marines.
The United States is destroying its 
subs at a site in Puget Sound in Wash
ington state.
In a short address, Perry told workers 
at the shipyard, The very difficult work 
you are doing here is making the world 
safer for our children and grandchil
dren.
The workers are being protected by 
U.S.-provided masks to help them 
breathe while smoke emerges from their 
blowtorches.
Hoosier smokers 
may lose rights'
INDIANAPOLIS, Oct. 18 (AP)  
Smokers already have lost the right to 
smoke in many workplaces and some 
restaurants. They also could lose the 
right to light up in their own cars in 
certain cases, if a resolution before the 
Indiana State Medical Association even
tually becomes law.
A resolution before delegates to the
 ISMA state convention this weekend 
calls for state legislation banning smok
ing in cars when children are present.
Its one of three tobacco-related reso
lutions before delegates.
The others call for mandatory infor
mation about tobacco use on death cer
tificates when relevant and for calling 
upon the state attorney general to sue 
tobacco companies to reimburse tax
payer money spent treating Hoosiers 
for smoking-related illnesses.
Dr. Stephen Jay, a pulmonologist at In
diana University School of Medicine, said 
that when a smoker lights up in a car  
particularly in winter with the windows 
closed smoke and carbon monoxide can 
build to dangerous levels. Children with 
asthma or other heart or lung problems are 
especially vulnerable, he said.
Were talking about an extremely toxic 
substance, Jay said. We know this 
stuff kills babies.
Dr. Richard McPherson of Lafayette, 
author of the resolution, said children 
who inhale smoke in cars and other 
confined areas experience more respira
tory illnesses and ear infections in the 
short term and possible addiction and 
lung injury in the long term.
Tom Lauria, spokesman for the To
bacco Institute in Washington, D.C., said 
the notion of banning smoking in cars 
takes Big Brother way too far.
The intrusive nature of that proposal 
is bound to rankle most members of the 
public, Lauria said.
Studies have attributed 10,000 deaths 
in Indiana each year to smoking and put 
the health care bill for smoking-related 
diseases at $700 million in 1990. Only a 
portion of those bills would be paid by 
the state through Medicaid, however.
Attorney General Pamela Carter is
seriously considering filing suit to re. 
cover medical costs from the tob 
industry, spokesman Rich Schneider 
said Thursday. Carteris considering tht 
action even though her term expires this 
year and she is not seeking re-election.
At least 17 states have filed such ac
tions, along with San Francisco and Los 
Angeles counties. The city of New York 
filed a lawsuit on Thursday.
The third tobacco-related resolution 
calls for requiring the Department of 
Health to gather data from death certifi. 
cates indicating if tobacco use contrib. 
uted to the cause of death.
Nation of Islam 
leader wont vote
CHICAGO, Oct. 15 (AP)Four months 
after launching a highly publicized voter 
registration drive, Nation of Islam leader 
Louis Farrakhan is saying he wont en
courage his followers to vote after all.
I really dont see anyone that is in the 
best interests of our people and an agenda 
that is in the best interest of the masses, 
Farrakhan said in an interview pub
lished in Tuesdays HrIcVwC vUoI0aIpe1/
I would not discourage our people 
from voting, but I dont see any candi
date that is worthy of my vote,
. Farrakhan said.
One year ago, Farrakhans Million 
Man March sent hundreds of thousands; 
of black men to Washington, where he 
urged them to become a political force. 
He announced in June that he was 
launching a voter-registration drive.
Farrakhan said, however, that he 
didnt vote in his states March primary 
and has not closely watched the race for 
the U.S. Senate.
Farrakhan has been widely criticized 
for anti-Semitic remarks, and U.S. offi
cials have chastised him for visiting 
Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi and 
Saddam Husseins Iraq.

50 YEARSAGO, Nov.191946: 
The Carnegie Day assembly, an
nual exercises in observance of 
Andrew Carnegies birthday, 
were set to be held on November
26 in the Carnegie Music Hall.
Classes were cancelled over a 
three hour block to permit the 
entire student body to attend. 
The celebration was held to honor 
those students who had obtained 
scholarships.
Scholastic awards were given 
to students and cups were 
awarded to the sorority and fra
ternity having the highest grade 
point average.
The ceremony began with a tra
ditional parade from the campus 
to Carnegie Hall. The Kiltie Band 
and ROTC led the parade and 
were followed in order by the Ex
ecutive Board, Student Council, 
faculty, graduate students, se
niors, juniors, sophomores, and 
freshmen. 'y
25 YEARS AGO, Oct. 281971: 
The manager of the CMU book
store estimated that the value of 
shoplifted items represented 
three percent of the 
establishments total sales. He
approximated that this figure 
approached $15,000 a year.
According to the manager, this 
frequency of stolen goods was 
becoming the trend, and was no 
better or worse than the reported 
cases of shoplifting at other uni
versities on-campus bookstores.
The manager noted that the 
biggest dollar loss in stolen mer
chandise was that on pilfered text
books, but indicated that losses 
in textbook inventory would not 
threaten the standard 10 percent 
textbook discount.
10 YEARS AGO, Oct. 281986: 
A major water main break 
occured near the rear entrance of 
the health center at Morewood 
Gardens. An 8-inch water feed 
line that supplied E-tower of 
Morewood broke, sending hun
dreds of gallons of water up 
through the sidewalk.
Physical plant personel were 
quickly on the scene and able 
to supply water to the building 
by running a bypass from the 
other four towers. The power 
was turned off to prevent any 
possible electrical hazards and 
the building was evacuated due
to lack of electricity.
Electricity was restored to Etower later that day after switch 
gear equipment was thoroughly 
cleaned and tested.
FIVE YEARS AGO, Oct. 21 
1991: Student Senate cut buggy 
funding to various campus orga
nizations. The policy was added 
to the revised Senate fiscal policy.
According to the new buggy 
policy, Senate agreed to pay for 
25 percent of an organizations 
buggy maintenance budget each 
year and 66 percent of the cost of 
producing one buggy every three 
years. Senate also said that an 
organization must first produce 
and run a buggy for one year on 
their own before they could re
ceive any money.
Previously, Senate had covered 
most of the buggy expenses for 
FRINGE, CIA, Pioneers, and 
Spirit. The cost of building a 
buggy varies from $3,000 to 
$7,000 dollars.
Strong opposition from the 
Greek organizations on campus 
motivated the cuts. Fraternities 
and sororities are not funded by 
Senate because of Senates policy
of not funding discriminatory or
ganizations.
Yes, any individual can go to a 
fraternity, said then Senate 
Chair Chris Neighbor, but [the , 
fraternities] do have the choice off 
who joins.
ONE YEAR AGO, Oct. 23 
1995: Civil rights leader Rever
end Jesse Jackson came to Oak
land to speak on behalf of a new t 
scholarship fund. However, the 
death of Jonny Gammage during 
a traffic stop dramatically 
changed the focus of his visit.
Pittsburgh police investigated 
the death because it occured just ^ 
inside city limits. The FBI was 
called in to see if the officers, who 
are white, violated Gammages 
civil rights.
While Jackson did indirectly 
discuss the scholarship issues by 
addressing the problems of ur
ban youths face in getting oppor
tunities for high education and 
good paying jobs, the primary fo
cus of his remarks were race rela
tions and the Gammage incident.

President leaves SDC

tiated during Spergers term is the 
Good Neighbor project. In this ini
tiative, SDC has been meeting and 
sharing knowledge with similar or
ganizations at other local colleges 
including Pitt, Chatham, Carlow, 
Duquesne, and La Roche. Sperger 
said that students will soon see joint 
efforts between these schools.
According to Sperger, SDC has de
veloped a specific mission, goals, 
and a long-term strategic plan. For 
instance, last semester SDC spent 
$20,000 that it did not anticipate 
(on the Morewood Recreation Room, 
Winter Fest, and the Fiesta de 
Prim aver a) and would have gone 
$17,000 into debt had they not made 
further plans.
As things stand now, SDC should 
be healthy financially for several years 
to come, Sperger said.
With Sperger at the helm of SDC, 
membership has increased to ap
proximately 60 members, and he 
has helped organize sessions for 
critical student issues on campus, 
such as drugs, alcohol, abuse, and 
stress. SDC also helped to bring 
about Sexual Violence Awareness 
Day on October 9, which was di
rected by Alexis Landeros.
I dont think its appropriate to name 
anybody, Sperger said when asked to 
name possible successors. Chandra
expressed similar sentiments.
The new president will have a lot 
on their hands. I dont want to put 
any more pressure on them, Sperger 
stated, but did say that the new chair 
should keep the organization on an 
even keel until [it] can stabilize the 
leadership again.
Nominations for the interim 
president will be solicited at the 
meeting on Wednesday, November 
20. Spergers resignation becomes 
effective after the election, which 
takes place two weeks later. The 
new president will serve the rest 
of Spergers term and hold office 
until March elections. Chandra 
will remain vice president of SDC.
Sperger has committed himself 
to making sure the transfer will be 
a smooth one, said Properties Com
mittee Chair Brian Bluth. Sperger 
will be around to ease the transition to 
a new president. In a similar situa
tion, as the previous Public Rela
tions chair, Sperger groomed a new 
chair from within the committee.
How much I stay involved will 
be dictated by how much work I 
have, Sperger said. Its appropri
ate for me to just advise people as 
they wish.
At the moment there arent any 
clear successors, Dunham said, 
Its just a matter of getting the 
right person in the top spot.
Coroner derails Gammage trial
CrggrCi, ty'S Iusl d
examined Gammages body and deter
mined that Gammage died from pres
sure on his neck and upper back.
In a previous term as coroner, he 
sparred with county officials who said he 
usedhis goveramentlab for private work.
Jurors were scheduled to spend Friday 
night at their Pittsburgh hotel before 
returning home to suburban Philadel
phia on Saturday. Cashman visited them 
Friday to thank them for their service.
Theyre frustrated. They would have 
liked to have made a decision, Cashman 
said. They spent a lot of time, they were 
very attentive, they worked very hard, 
and they were very, very interested in 
this case.
Jurors told Cashman they felt the key 
prosecution witness, tow truck driver 
Frank Belajac, was believable because 
he had no reason to lie and appeared to
be reluctant to testify.
Jurors also told Cashman they put less 
stock in the testimony of Whitehall police 
Sergeant Keith Henderson and felt he 
acted predictably for a police officer who 
wanted to protect his colleagues.
Because of news stories about the case, 
jurors had been chosen from Chester 
County, a site chosen by the state Su
preme Court.
Black leaders criticized the outcome of 
jury selection: an all-white jury except 
for one Hispanic alternate. Chester 
County is six percent black. Pittsburghs 
county,'Allegheny, is 11.9 percent black.
Another panel will be selected some
where in Pennsylvaniawithin two months.
Cashman criticized prosecutors for 
failing to control witnesses. Wecht went 
on ABC televisions Good Morning 
America, on Thursday and discussed 
Gammages wounds. Wecht was in New
York to promote his book, HVU1e Ct zeVlri 
Also Thursday, two of Gammages friends 
who were witnesses appeared on a Pitts
burgh television talk show.
The judge earlier forbade all attorneys 
and witnesses from talking about the case.
Comment? You gotta be nuts, said 
Christopher Conrad, the No. 2 prosecu
tor in County District Attorney Robert 
Colvilles office. Seals threw up his hands 
and said, I got a gag order, man.
Gammages father, also named Jonriy, 
walked stonefaced through the court
room with his arm around his wife, 
Narves. She appeared to have a tear in 
her eye as Conrad led her into Colvilles 
suite.
Mr. and Mrs. Gammage are entitled 
to a decision in this case, as it has been 
more than a year since their son died. 
The same goes for Mr. Albert and Mr. 
Mulholland, Cashman said.

He*s back. Your housemates "boyfriend. Sitting on your sofa. 
Sifting through your CDs. Hunching over the open refrigerator. 
"Say," he says accusingly, "did. you guys know youre out of food? 
Gee, I wonder why. You like your housemate. You value the friend
ship. But the boyfriend is beginning to create bad feelings of
| proportions. Night after night, he appears. 
First stop, refrigerator. Second stop, micro
wave. Sometimes he forgets to check whether the housemate 
is even home, causing you to believe his affection is based 
somewhat on the success of the last shopping trip. You think 
your housemate is 'beginning to suspect this as well, 
which is probably why the housemate is not here tonight. 
Sudden date with the library. The housemates boyfriend is 
talking to you again; he wants to know if you can pick up some 
cheese-in-a-can next time youre at the store. You say, "I hate 
to be rude, but Im tired and you need to leave." You wait for 
protests from the sofa, but there are none. But thats because 
the boyfriend is not on the sofa. Hes drifted over to the TV, 
filling your once-quiet domicile with sounds from the shop
ping network. You cant sleep with this on. You wonder what
its gonna take. A natural disaster?
A ... wait a minute. Veil, sure. You smile. "Say, do you like 
video games?" Boyfriend nods eagerly. "Its the latest thing," 
you say. "My friends in Paris play it whenever they want to 
connect with their friends in Johannesburg. Its great for 
people who like to travel." You turn toward him and say sweetly,
"You like to travel, right?"
He nods. You smile again. Type in a few commands. Hand the 
wireless mouse to him. Then count. Five. Four. Three. Two. One.
Oh good, hes chosen FULL ENGAGE mode. Boyfriends gone. Foods 
gone, too. Oh well. Into everyones life a little rain must fall.
Which, you think as you catch the mouse in midair, is exactly 
what its doing in Paris right now. Damn, thats good software.
What will the next generation of software be? Come to Microsoft and shape it. 
Real jobs. Real internships. With real responsibility.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  21 October 1996
Slip in GSIA rankings accredited to visibility, size of school
Cear, ty'S Iusl d
survey. Thats what we suspect, said 
Oprison. So were going to ask these 
corporations [those which do respond 
to the survey] what skills we lack. Are 
there areas we can target?
In terms of improving the corpo
rate ranking, Oprison said, It just 
comes down to our ability to get our 
message out. Our program is consid
ered one of the most difficult and the 
most time-consuming. In one way 
thats a strength and one way thats 
a weakness. We spend more time do
ing work than interacting with com
panies. But graduates have an ex
traordinary ability to get a large 
amount of work done in a short 
amount of time.
Oprison agreed with Dean Baybars
regarding the quality of GSIA. Our 
faculty consistently ranks higher in 
terms of innovation than most other 
business schools. Were one of the 
few business schools where you can 
take electives so early in [the 
coursework]. You have a lot of free
dom to choose your own specialties. 
For example, you can come out of 
here with three concentrations.
Even though the current year shows a 
drop in rankings for GSIA, Dean B aybars 
is optimistic.
We acknowledge that theres a prob
lem with the perspectives of corpora
tions. But were optimistic and were 
proud of the way our students feel 
about our program. We feel such a 
high level of appreciation by gradu
ates will, in the long run, impact the
perceptions of the corporations. For 
the first time we have a dean who 
came from the business world. We 
feel were in prime position to turn 
around our image in the corporate 
world.
Douglas Dunn, dean of GSIA and 
former AT&T executive, was out of 
town and could not be reached for 
comment.

Crime and Incident Report
10/15 CRIMINAL MIS
CHIEF, 9:37 pm. An officer was 
dispatched by a fraternity to 
gather a report. At the frater
nity, the officer learned that in 
the past weekend, someone had 
painted the fire hydrant near 
the house.
A trail of paint lead from the 
hydrant to the quad side of the 
house near the front door. A 
brother told the officer that he 
wanted to file a report so that the 
house would not be accused of 
hydrant painting.
10/15 HARASSMENT BY 
COMMUNICATIONS, 5:34pm. 
The gym requested an officer to 
take a report. A caller, who wished 
to be identified as Lucifer, Sa
tan, and the devil, had left a 
lengthy message.
Due to a slur in the callers 
voice, some of the content was 
difficult to decipher, but it was
clear that attempt to instill fear 
was real. The caller mentioned 
feeling murderous.
Because it was an off-canpus 
call, the connection number was 
not displayed. As a precaution
ary measure, the officer placed 
a call with telecommunications 
to have a caller ID placed on the 
phone, although this may not 
always identify calls, especially 
if the call was made via a cellu
lar phone.
10/18 MEDICAL, 11:18 pm. 
An officer was dispatched to 
Morewood E-Tower. Upon arrival 
the officer found EMS personnel 
treating a student with a head 
wound.
The student stated receiving 
the injury when jumping down 
the 3rd floor stairs of E-tower. 
The students head hit the top 
of the ceiling, causing the in
jury. The officer provided
transportation to Presbyterian 
University Hospital Emer
gency Room.

FORUM
Carnegie Mellon University21 October 1996
Wearing jeans should 
not imply social stance
Wear shoes this Wednes
day if you support the torture of 
animals. If you saw this poster 
on campus, would you go bare
foot for a day?
Qn October 30th, cmuOUT is 
sponsoring the local edition of 
Gay Jeans Day, a homosexual 
rights awareness program held 
on college campuses around the 
country By equating an act as 
automatic as pulling on a pair of 
jeans to an issue as critical as 
gay rights, cmuOUT must be 
hoping to get as many people as 
possible thinking. This, it seems, 
is a bit underhanded and may 
be ineffectual. Getting people to 
think about an issue and forcing 
them into taking a stance are 
two different things.
Consider what the broad term, 
support for Gays and Lesbi
ans, actually means. Does sup
port indicate acceptance, advo
cacy or can it also indude grudg
ing acknowledgment? Does sup
port of the homosexual lifestyle 
mean acceptance of same-sex 
marriages? When the issue at 
hand is as broad as support, 
people should not be forced into 
taking a stance and that is ex
actly what Gay Jeans day does. 
On the morning of the 30th, 
everyone will be making a state
ment, whether they want to or 
not. Is it fair for gay rights activ
ists to force this decision upon 
us?
If the purpose is to get people 
who read the cmuOUT advertisement to think about gay and 
lesbian issues, then encourag
ing. them to wear a ribbon, a 
specially printed T-shirt or hat, 
would be sufficient. More im
portantly, there would be no 
chance of sending the wrong 
message.
The fact that Gay Jeans Day 
forces everyone into making a 
statement is particularly unfair 
for people who may not be aware 
of the event. A sympathetic per
son may have missed the adver
tisement and would never think 
of asking all the people who wore 
jeans yesterday why theyre 
wearing jeans again today. On 
the other hand, they would cer
tainly be curious, and thereby 
informed, if they woke up one 
morning and all of their friends 
were wearing ribbons or con
spicuous dress. Something, of 
course, more consipicious than 
a pair of Levis.
It is imperative that cmuOUT 
provide a visible and unambigu
ous symbol of their mission. To 
force the entire student body to 
take a stand for or against gay 
and lesbian lifestyles is quite 
different from supplying inter
ested parties with a means to 
voice their opinions. Donotmake 
those not wearing jeans on Oc
tober 30 unwittingly assume a 
position on something as impor
tant as homosexuality. And do 
not let an issue as important as 
this one be reduced to a matter 
as superficial as wardrobe.
Festival passes with 
little impact on campus
Last weeks International Fes
tival was notable for a number of 
things: greater student involve
ment in its planning and execu
tion than in previous years, a 
good list of quality guests and 
speakers, an interesting array of 
discussion topics, and a wide va
riety of entertainment. It is un
fortunate that because of ques
tionable staging, a good many 
people did not take notice until it 
was almost over.
This years celebration, while 
being as good, if not better than 
previous years in terms of con
tent, lacked an atmosphere of 
festivity. There was no clear com
mencement of the weeks activi
ties and so, by the time there was 
actually a feeling of occasion, the 
week was nearly over. This years 
celebration of Latin America and 
the Caribbean was well under
way before any one really noticed 
it was there. The surest indica
tion of this was the poor turnout 
at many of the educational pre
sentations held on the second 
floor of the UC during the week 
inspite of their indisputable qual
ity.
The festival supplement, post
er^ and brochures were good pro
motional devices for people whose 
interest in the ocassion had al
ready been stirred.
But too few people were inter
ested, and as a result, too few 
people made use of the informaLetters to the Editor
Campus police responds 
to validity of article
& tSBHLetters to tho Editor Tilt TartanUniversity Center Rm. 314
Letter to 
the Editor
tion available to them.
This is attributable, largely, to 
a clear need on the part of the 
administration to showcase the 
University Center. By keeping 
all the events inside the Univer
sity Center, the organizers en
sured there was no substantial 
visual clue that a festival had 
begun. The International Festi
val posters, although catchy and 
well-designed, are essentially no 
different from all the other post
ers weve already seen inside the 
University Center this semester, 
and will continue to see. In pre
vious years, the appearance of 
tents on the Mall were a sure 
indication that something of a 
festive nature was about to be
gin.
Thats not to say that the Inter
national Festival should not have 
been held in the $50 million dol
lar UC. The weather during the 
weekend certainly proved that 
holding the events indoors was a 
good decision, even though cold 
and wet conditions didnt stop 
400 people from seeing Martin 
Yan last year. It simply means 
that another substantial event 
or symbol should have been em
ployed to perform the role previ
ously filled by the tents. A weeklong schedule of events needs to 
be kicked-off with a bang so that

Editor:
We, the undersigned, are all employees 
of the Carnegie Mellon Campus Police 
Department. We come to work each day, 
striving to diligently do our duties to keep 
this campus safe and secure as best we 
can. However, after reading your article in 
the October 7 issue, we marveled at the size of the Campus 
Police force that is portrayed. We feel that the campus 
community has a right to know just how understaffed the 
department is.
For example, the article states, Campus Police has in
creased the number of plain-clothed officers on duty since the 
semester since the number of on-campus thefts has increased. 
In reality, for one and only one week in September, both 
detectives were put on plain clothes patrol; taking them away 
from their investigational duties. These detectives were 
supplemented by police officers on their days off. These plain
clothes patrols were disbanded after two arrests were made, 
even though bicycle and other thefts continued unabated.
The article also states, From 3 - 11pm four police officers 
and three to four security guards are on duty with additional 
officers who patrol from 9 pm to 2 am. In reality this shift is 
usually staffed with just three officers, with many days 
seeing only two on duty. As for the security guards, what the 
article doesnt mention is that most of the guards are re
stricted to certain posts, such as the East Campus Garage and 
Software Engineering Institute, and do not patrol the main 
campus. This leave only one or two guards to patrol the 
campus. As for those two extra articles, they are only on duty 
two nights a week, and are assigned exclusively to the 
fraternity area.
Finally, the article states, Four officers patrol from 11 pm 
to 7am with one supervisor who is always on duty.
In reality, this shift is usually staffed with three officers, 
and for three of the first weekends this semester there was no 
supervisor on duty.
The annual statistical report published by Campus Police 
department each year boasts, twenty one armed officers 
constitute the police staff. What is not mentioned is that a 
full third of these police officers are involved in administra
tive, (one chief), supervisory, (1 lieutenant, three sergeants), 
and investigative (two detectives) duties. This only leaves 
fourteen police officers available to conduct uniformed patrol. 
This is the exact number of police officers employed by 
Carnegie Mellon University in 1979, when the campus area
was much smaller, and the campus population was signifi
cantly less.
If after seeing the reality of the numbers of police officers 
and security guards available for patrol, you still believe that 
the Campus Police Department is adequately staffed, try and 
convince someone who just had their wallet, bicycle, or other 
property stolen this semester.

SDC Chair explains loss 
of Homecoming dance
i ^3Letters to the Editor Hie Tartan  University Center Rm. 314
Letter to 
the Editor
Editor:
I am writing you regarding the edito
rial (Homecoming dance tradtitionmust 
not die, 10/7/1996), that bemoaned the 
loss of the Clippership dance this year.
Last year SDC sustained a loss from 
the Clippership event that was not as 
high as $4000, which you stated in your editorial, but was 
significant enough for us to decide not to organize the event.
We reached this decision well in advance of our planning 
and budgeting processes for the current year, and as a 
consequence we do not have any money allocated by our 
Programming Committee. Were we to attempt to hold the 
dance this year and fail once more to break even, our ability 
to fund other planned programs planned would suffer.
The Homecoming Committee has invested a great amount 
of time and energy in planning events for the big weekend. 
In a year when student organizations seem to bfe working 
together effectively, we do not wish to duplicate the efforts 
of our programming counterparts in any other group. I have 
heard some rumblings about students being dissatisfied 
with the social events scheduled for Homecoming. We in 
SDC support and respect the efforts of the committee. If 
students are not happy with the planned events, we hope 
they will recommend changes to improve the event plan 
instead of trying to program against Homecoming.
In order to provide valuable services and programs, it is 
necessary for us to continually question the traditions that 
we carry on from year to year. This year we simply do not 
have the money, the tim, or the inclination to sponsor a 
Clippership dance.

Media overlooks Clinton treacheries
James Stepanek
I dont know how many of you read a 
newspaper, but a new Clinton scandal 
has managed to rear its ugly head. Mind 
you, considering the horde of scandals 
that has already infested this adminis
tration, it should come as little surprise 
when another sign of corruption sur
faces on the horizon.
The latest scandal has to do with 
Clinton and the Democratic party alleg
edly accepting large contributions, many 
of which are illegal (or in a very gray 
area), from major business interests in 
Indonesia. A man named Mochtar Riady 
and his son James have been tunneling 
a good amount of money into the Demo
cratic National Committee coffers for a 
while now. Considering that the Riadys 
are not U.S. citizens and that the money 
was not earned in the United States, 
these contributions are violations of the 
election funding laws.
So, you may say, they violated an elec
tion law, big deal, right? Well, I know 
Clinton and many of those who support 
him have little use for laws, but the 
simple fact here is that the Indonesians 
are buying influence. Somehow, an in
vestigation of Indonesian labor policies 
related to trade issues was killed at the 
behest of the Clinton administration, 
and their favorable trading status was 
continued. This investigation could have 
affected the $600 million in trade be
tween the U.S. and Indonesia. Another 
aspect was Clinton overriding State De
partment staffers. The State Depart
ment advised against a meeting with 
Indonesian President Suharto (one of 
those President-for-Life types), which 
Clinton ended up arranging. It would 
appear that the administration was sim
ply bought and paid for. A rather tawdry 
spectacle that one wouldnt expect from 
the presidency  well, a normal presi
dency maybe. You can check these alle
gations yourself since this was reported 
in the Los Angeles Times on Wednes
day, October 16.
When you look at the history of scan
dals of this presidency, you should have 
two reactions. The first should be either 
shame at what the office has become, or 
maybe just simple revulsion.
The second should be a complete lack 
of surprise that a scandal like this would 
come out. Clinton and his administra
tion have a continuing history of abus
ing the powers of the office to further 
their own power or to promote their 
friends interests.
This is a list thats simply too long for 
the space constraints of a column. Theres 
the secret health reform meetings, the 
travel office firings, the Vince Foster 
suicide with associated document 
coverup, the evasions of Paula Joness 
charges of harassment, Webster 
Hubbels federal conviction, the Espy 
graft, the Ron Brown Vietnam bribes, 
the illegal FBI files, and now this busi
ness of foreign money buying influence 
(mind you, this is only the list off the top 
of my head, there are more).
I do think that some of these scandals
bear special consideration. The Travel 
Office firings, the Foster case, and the 
illegal files all show a blatant misuse of 
major powers of the presidency. In each 
case the administration suborned fed
eral agencies to cover up misdeeds or to 
actively commit one.
In the case of the Travel Office firings, 
a friend of Clinton (known as FOB  
Friend of Bill), decided that he wanted 
lucrative Travel Office contracts ar
ranged with his travel agency, but the 
manager of the agency, Billy Dale, 
balked. This lead to the First Lady hound
ing the man out of his job and attempt
ing to have the FBI bring him up on 
trumped-up charges. When these 
charges finally saw a courtroom, Dale 
was completely exonerated.
Its interestinghow these scandals are 
tied together. The case of Vince Foster is 
one which I have addressed in the past 
(if you want a copy of those articles, 
email me). Foster, a longtime FOB, al
legedly killed himself by a self-inflicted 
gunshot wound in Ft. Marcy Park. The 
White House explanation was that he 
was depressed due to unfavorable press 
coverage over such things as the Travel 
Office firings. Of course, the case for a 
suicide has more holes than a Clinton 
staffers memory.
The body was found neatly laid out, 
with the gun in his hand (yet there were 
no fingerprints), on an incline in the 
park. Somehow there were drip marks 
where the blood must have run uphill. 
The gun and his hand had no bloodstains 
on them (which is impossible consider
ing that he shot himself by putting the

gun in his mouth).
His car keys were not found 
on him despite two searches, 
but miraculously appeared 
once a member of the White 
House staff went to the morgue 
to identify the body. The sui-. 
cide note was found a few 
weeks late, only after Fosters 
briefcase had been searched 
multiple times. When the note 
was finally found, it had been 
tom into multiple pieces, which 
curiously did not have any fin
gerprints on them. Even more 
curiously, once the note was 
analyzed by three top hand
writing experts, it was declared 
a forgery.
In spite of all this, the case 
was immediately declared a 
suicide and the. investigation 
was run by the Park Police.
Now we get onto the last of 
these linked scandals: the ille
gal files. This case is the one 
which has me most confused 
with the popular response. 
This is such a blatant abuse of 
power that I can't understand 
why everyone across the na
tion isnt screaming for imme
diate impeachment.
More than 900 FBI back
ground files were accessed on 
people who were no longer as
sociated with the White House, 
and also were never likely to 
need a background check be
cause of a visit.
Most of them were people 
from the prior Republican ad
ministrations.
There is no other possible 
use for this mass of informa
tion other than an enemies list 
and possible blackmail.
Oh, in case youre wonder
ing what the connection to the 
Travel Office is  they also 
appropriated Billy Dales file.
The scandal is also linked to Vince 
Foster in that it was claimed by 
some administration officials that 
Foster hiredLivingstone (the man 
in charge of files and security), 
yet Livingstone said (in front of 
Congress) he had never met Fos
ter. This last bit is particularly 
interesting in that Livingstone 
was the staffer who identified 
Fosters body at the morgue.
The Clintons defense that it 
was a harmless bureaucratic 
snafu is a feeble lie. There is 
normally a log that keeps track of 
who accesses these files. Some
how there is a six-month gap, 
which the White House claims is 
just a case of people forgetting to 
keep it up. In a deposition, Mari 
Anderson, who worked in the se
curity office, stated that the logs 
were kept during that time pe
riod. This was reported in The 
Wall Street Journal on October 
14. She also, even more interest
ingly, states that she had crossed 
the names of former White House 
occupants off the list and that 
they were deliberately put back 
on. So muchfor a snafu. One may 
might like to recall what snafu 
means - Situation Normal: All 
F_cked Up.
The consistent pattern of lies, 
coverups, and evasion, which all 
spring from real misdeeds, would 
have sunk any Republican Presi
dent long ago. Such a host of 
indefensible criminal acts is com
pletely unacceptable in the Of
fice of the President.
If for no other reason, policy 
issues aside, one simply cannot 
vote for Clinton without com
pletely abrogating any respect for 
the Office of the President or this 
nations laws.

Writer reexamines Republican vote
 Id like to 
digress from 
my planned 
series on 
education to
________________________MCu Orris discuss the
upcoming
elections.
Im going to try to convince you to vote Republi
can.
Now, as anyone who knows me or has read some 
of my past columns can attest to, I am not a 
Republican and have little love for them.
Many Republicans are what I would call fis
cally responsible socialists. They have the same 
sickening altruistic attitude of the liberals: that 
they have a moral right to steal money from one 
group of people  to give to another, but think we 
should just handle the finances better. Bob Dole, 
sadly, is among this group.
However, not all the Republicans are this bad, 
and this Congress has managed to accomplish 
quite a lot, given the enormous opposition to 
them. On the other hand, the Democrats, espe
cially Clinton, are a very great deal worse than 
many people think.
The misinformation and hypocrisy of the Demo
crats in this campaign has been astounding.
Take the Medicare issue, for example. The 
Democrats have spent millions of dollars on ads 
stating that the Republicans were cutting Medi
care, and that their intention was to throw your 
grandmother out in the snow. This is ridiculous.
To begin with, the Republicans are uCl cutting 
Medicare. The point is that they were cutting the 
rate of increase in the program from 11 percent a 
year to seven percent. They were not cutting 
current spending. The hypocrisy is that when 
Clinton first came into office, he proposed cutting 
the rate of increase to six percent, and he was very 
careful to stress that these were uCl cuts.
Of course, when the Republicans try to cut the 
rate of increase less than Clinton had proposed, 
its Those evil Republicans are making draconian 
cuts in Medicare! They want to kill old people!
As to these last charges, the Republicans arent 
out to kill people or any such nonsense. They 
simply recognize that the runaway spending on 
insane entitlement programs such as Medicare 
must stop. In my opinion, they should be doing a 
lot more to eliminate these programs, but at least 
theyre attempting to do something.
If the liberals are worried about killing people, 
perhaps they should look at the effects of their
failed policies over the past several decades.
This sort of hysteria came up in every issue, 
whether Medicare, education, welfare, you name 
it. The Republicans managed to cut about one 
percent of the federal budget, and for this, they 
are vilified as extremists and fascists.
Something that A1 Gore said sums up the atti
tudes of the liberals nicely. He said, How can you 
trust Bob Dole with his risky plan for the 
economy?
Bob Doles plan is to cut taxes across the board 
by 15 percent and cut the capital gains tax in half. 
He plans, in effect, to let you keep more of the 
money that OCU earned, that is yours :O oIwrli
This is what A1 Gore considers risky. In a way, 
it is. If more people are allowed to keep their own 
money, and if we start eliminating these damn 
giveaway programs, people will discover that 
they dont need the liberals.
To them, that is dangerous indeed.
They consider that tax money to be lreIo1/ not 
yours. Your lives are their toys to play with, to 
shape by force in whatever image they wish.
It is interesting to note that every time conser
vatives suggest cutting taxes or increasing free
dom, the Democrats and the mediajump on them, 
demanding that they prove their plan will work.
Yet the liberals have spent decades enacting 
one socialist scheme after another, with no ac
countability, with no question of cost, and no 
concern for the glaringly obvious destruction their 
policies inflict upon America. But its freedom 
that has to be justified.
Another thing I hear all the time from liberals 
is, How are we going to afford Doles tax cut? 
Now, I could get into the idea of supply side 
economics, but I wont bother.
I really dont care if we can afford the major 
tax cut. If it means cutting socialist programs, 
good. The damned communists didnt bother to 
ask me if I could afford your high taxes and 
intrusion into my life.
If Clinton wins this election, and especially if 
the Congress reverts to a Democratic majority, it 
will be a disaster for the country. You can bet that 
taxes will rise, that the economy will worsen, and 
controls will tighten about your life. The record of 
the past several decades speaks for itself.
The Republicans, especially the House fresh
men here near as far as I would like, but I much 
prefer taking a small step forward than to take a 
huge step back.

Columnists dread mortal threat of 1996 presidential election
RANT
Another election year is upon 
us, and the time is quickly ap
proaching when once again the 
finger of the American public will 
press down on the pop-o-matic 
bubble of American politics and 
try to decide which one of the 
three stooges we want to be the 
leader of the free world.
Bill Clinton is a man outstand
ing in his field, and Im not talk
ing 400 acres of amber waves of 
grain, here. Im talking cow pas
ture. And I hope Billys wearing 
the Presidential hip boots, be
cause if hes not, hes shoveling so 
much bullshit that Hillarys go
ing to be washing manure out of 
the first Chinos.
Bills got to watch his step or 
else hes gonna fall through one 
of the holes in his platform  a 
platform that has more holes in it
than a Kurdish outhouse.
Bob Dole, a political behemoth, 
well, half a behemoth, really, lum
bering like an angina-ridden 
minotaur through Congress, now 
aspires to the presidency, fulfill
ing his manifest destiny. Jack 
Kemp says that Dole is the quar
terback on this team... I hope he 
remembers to roll right. Bob Dole 
stands on his platform hawking 
good government at rock bottom 
prices, like a fish vendor in 
Chinatown, and the red herring 
is selling fast.
Well, I guess that what Clinton 
cant save you in tax cuts, he can 
either steal for you, or acquire by 
selling a little kind bud out of the 
Lincoln Bedroom. Looking at 
that, and keeping in mind that 
Doles been around since the Dead 
Sea was only sick, I guess the 
choice comes down to whether 
you want the man sitting in the 
Oval Office sucking on a hookah 
or a respirator.
Looking at the candidates 
stand on the major issues of the
day would be a good way to pro
ceed at this point, but I dont 
think many of us know just where 
these men stand on those issues. 
After the Presidential debate, it 
seems that the American public 
will accept political posturing as 
a substitute for ideals, and it be
comes more evident that Capitol 
Hill is flattening, with the merit 
of a Presidential candidate re
duced to the cleanliness of his 
colon. As Clinton tries to put his 
past in front of him, Dole works to 
polish his public persona. You 
know, watching these two debate 
is like playing Rockem Sockem 
Robots without the heads.
Rights and lefts flying every
where and never really landing 
except to cold cock the American 
conscience for not requiring more 
of the man who would lead this 
country. After the debate, some 
would say that Dole put on a good 
show, dropping his one-liners, and 
consequently his stjgmatic stiff
ness, and some might say that he 
has more character than Clinton.
Well, saying someone has more 
character than Bill Clinton is not 
unlike saying someone has more 
character than Boo Radley. In 
addition, the debate enforced a 
demonstrated narrowing of the 
political spectrum.
As the candidates perform their 
Frogger-esque scamper for the 
middle of the road, theyre 
trapped like illegal immigrants 
trying to cross the 1-5 in San 
Diego, and the word radical is 
expurgated from the political dic
tionary as quickly as the word 
intellectual has been. A case in 
point: am I wrong in thinking 
that Clinton ran on a ticket very 
supportive of gays in the military 
in 1992? And as the First Lady 
wonders just how she and her 
husband were pegged as liberal, 
it doesnt surprise me that Clinton 
signed the bill disallowing na
tional recognition of same-sex 
marriages.
Maybe Im the only one who 
reacted with an caught-in-theheadlights kind of stare when
they heard that Perot was still 
going, doing his best impression 
of Don Knotts doing rI1 best im
pression of Hitler. While popular 
with the run government like a 
business crowd, it doesnt seem 
that Perots really posing a threat 
to Dole and Clinton.
Keep in mind, though, that de
mocracy is all about choices. None 
of this really matters. What 
should be on our minds when we 
step into that little booth is how 
these men think, and where they 
stand. This we can learn by look
ing at how theyve legislated in 
the past, and by hoping that 
sooner or later one of their pre
programmed responses will ad
dress a topic thats important to 
us.

ashington, Denver need to thank fairy godmothers
The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  21 October 1996
4th and 26
:O vleke HrVouCU:I
If Cinderellas fairy godmother hadnt 
hown up when she did and magically 
iurned her life around, Cinderella would 
still be scrubbing the kitchen floor and 
loing dishes instead of dancing at the 
oyal ball. The Denver Broncos and 
Vashington Redskins got lucky that 
iheir fairy godmothers showed up when 
they did to totally turn around two teams 
frho were at or near the bottom of their 
espective divisions a year ago.
Every year, we see a team who everyjody disregards but seemingly comes 
jut of nowhere to steal the spotlight. 
Last year, the Indianapolis Colts came 
very close to crashing the big dance, 
\vhen they sneaked into the playoffs as a 
wild card team, and came within a Hail 
Marys pass away from upsetting Pittsmrgh and going to the Super Bowl. This 
rear both Washington and Denver hold 1 records after finishing last year at ,-11 and 8-8, respectively.
The Redskins can thank Terry Allen 
for staying healthy and carrying their 
iffense to six straight victories after 
losing to Philadelphia in their home
opener. Last season, Allen scored 11 
touchdowns. This season, hes on pace to 
at least double that performance, hav
ing already scored a league-leading 10 
touchdowns.
Allen, a free-agent pick-up last year 
from Minnesota, has a history of bad 
knee injuries, having already had major 
surgery on both knees in the 1990s. The 
Redskins would be in trouble if they 
lost Terry, having only superstar-returner-but-not-too-great-a-runningback Brian Mitchell as a backup. Allen 
is the workhorse of Norv Turners of
fense, and only Barry Sanders, Emmitt 
Smith, Chris Warren, and Marshall 
Faulk have more combined yardage in 
the past two years.
Last year, the Redskins were in the 
middle of a quarterback controversy with 
Heath Shuler and Gus Frerotte. Even 
though Allen had a strong 1995 cam
paign, the Redskins were too disar
rayed to focus on a steady offensive 
plan and capitalize on. Allens run
ning. This year, with Frerotte as 
the undisputed starter, the 
Redskins offense has been doing 
their jobs: scoring, making plays, 
and keeping their defense off the 
field and rested. The Redskins 
defense, with newly acquired Pro-Bowl 
tackle Sean Gilbert leading the way, 
tops the league in fewest points allowed.
Even though they are on top of the 
NFC East, the Redskins are not receiv
ing much respect. So far they lost to the 
only competent team that theyve come 
up against, the Philadelphia Eagles, and 
the Eagles are only a game behind them
for the lead in the East. The second half 
of their schedule is a lot more difficult, 
with games against Indianapolis,
Buffalo,
PhiladelSlmona Lo/Tartan Art Co-Editor
phia again, San Francisco, and Dallas 
twice in the last four weeks. The Redskins 
will need to continue rushing the ball 
and stopping opponents in order to fin
ish the season, the same way they started 
it, but if they win just four more games, 
having Tampa Bay and Arizona twice 
left on their schedule, they are a lock for 
the playoffs this season.
The Denver Broncos have been 
having a Cinderella season of their 
own this year. Their fairy god
mother gave them the defense 
theyve always been searching 
for and a strong West Coast run
ning back in Terrell Davis.
Broncos fans can finally re
turn the D to Denver in their 
banners, as the D has truly re
turned. Denvers three biggest 
acquisitions this off-season have 
been linebackers Bill 
Romanowski and John Mobley, 
and defensive end Alfred Will
iams. With the help of these new 
additions Denvers defense has 
been near the top of the league in 
almost all categories for most of 
the season.
Terrell Davis returns as the start
ing running back after having a 
Cinderella season of his own last year. 
Davis was drafted in the sixth round of 
1995 draft, and came in second to New 
England running back Curtis Martin as 
NFL rookie of the year. This year, Davis 
is outgaining Martin in both yardage 
and touchdowns, and is sharing the AFC 
rushing title with Pittsburghs Jerome 
Bettis. The Broncos are using a version
of the West Coast offense which stresses 
the running game. This offense allows 
Terrell Davis to take a lot of the pressure 
off John Elway, whos been having a 
stellar year as well. Elway is proving to 
the league that hes still one of the top 
quarterbacks today. His favorite targets 
this year have been tight end Shannon 
Sharpe and wide receiver Ed McCaffrey, 
hitting both for five touchdowns so far 
this season.
The Broncos have been riding high 
atop the AFC West, but just like the 
Redskins and Eagles, the Broncos are in 
a tight race with the Kansas City Chiefs, 
with whom they lost in week 4.
They, too, havent faced much compe
tition so far this year, but their schedule 
is a lot easier than the Redskinss down 
the stretch. Green Bay, Minnesota, and 
Kansas City pose as the only remaining 
tough games on their schedule.
The Redskins and Broncos can thank 
a strong running game and defense for 
where theyre at right now. They have 
their hopes high this year that theyll 
make the playoffs, but both teams will 
need more than their fairy godmoth-; 
ers turning a pumpkin into a carriage 
and seven mice into horses if they 
want get to the big dance. If theyre: 
not careful the clock will be striking 
midnight before they know it, and 
theyll be stuck with just a pumpkin 
and mice.

:There is no position in sport as 
lobJeas goaltending. These were 
he words of Vladislav Tretiak, 
)iie of the greatest goalies ever in 
rofessional hockey. As part of 
;he Russian Red Army team of 
ild, he scared the hell of out the 
Canadian national team during 
their first trip to Russia. He beat 
hem at their own, game, and on 
he ice, he was a lightning-relexed god.
Most of all, Tretiak was the 
tnchor on his team. He was their 
eader. The best goalies dont just 
top pucks that are flying at their 
leads of speed of over 100 miles 
lper hour; their performance on 
he ice must be commanding and 
insistent. Their fearlessness and 
itrength is the motivating factor
which turns a team towards vic
tory. Here are, in our opinion, the 
five best goalies that are playing 
the game today.
For the past few seasons, John 
Vanbiesbrouck has been the sav
ing grace of the Florida Panthers. 
Last year, at 32, Beezer led his 
team to the Stanley Cup Finals. 
The Beezers best attributes are 
his quickness, especially when 
he moves laterally, and his glove 
hand, which many contend is the 
best in the league. You wont get 
any arguments here.
Beezer should be fresh and 
healthy when the playoffs begin. 
This year, he should repeat his 
199596 regular season perfor
mance when had a 90.4 percent 
save average and a goal-against 
average of 2.68 goals a game. He 
seems to be on his way, posting a 6-0 shut-out with 21 saves last 
week versus Hartford. It was his 
first of the season, the 24th of his 
career. With two years left in his 
contract, dont be too surprised if 
the Panthers are the ones hoist
ing the Cup this year.
The Hockey News ranks the 
Colorado Avalanche first in the 
field of 26 teams, suggesting that
with their superb forwards, awe
some defense and solid 
goaltending, that they could go 
all the way, again! A dynasty in 
the Rockies? It probably doesnt 
phase Patrick Roy; he has seen it 
all before. After all, he was a 
Montreal Canadien for most of 
the season, and Montreal has 
tasted the Cup many times. Half 
of the young goalies in the NHL 
are in total awe of him, and you 
dont become an idol for nothing. 
Second coming of Jacques Plante? 
Not in the regular season this 
year! But, at thirty, he would 
have gotten that third Con 
Smythe during the playoffs, if it 
hadnt been for that pesky Joe 
Sakic. With regular season num
bers of 90.8 percent save average 
and 2.78 goals against per game, 
Roy brickwalled his way through 
the playoffs with a 92.1 percent 
save average and a goals against 
average of 2.10. Pressure? Ah, 
its a walk in the park.
Curtis Joseph (known as Cujo
 lovingly, of course) rarely gets 
the recognitionhe deserves. Over
shadowed by fellow Central Con
ference rookie goaltender, Felix 
Potvin, Cujo labored laudlessly
in St. Louis for three years. Why 
did Team Canada choose him as 
one of their goalies in the World 
Cup and why is he on our top five 
list, with numbers from last sea
son like this  88.6 percent save 
percentage and 3.44 goals against 
per game? Consider that the Oil
ers cant get it together. The dy
nasty is long over. Their defense 
is non-existent and when Bill 
Ranford left last year, Cujo 
stepped in to the light with no 
protection. Joseph is the best 
goalie in the league below the 
face-off circles, making it nearly 
impossible to stuff one in from up 
close. His style is a little avantgarde, and he is on the ice too 
much. The only way to beat him 
is to be patient, make him go 
down, and put the puck top shelf 
(see Valeri Kamensky of the Ava
lanche last Tuesday night).
Dominik Hasek is tough as 
nails. The Sabress record lags, 
Hasek gets pulled over for driv
ing under the influence, plays 
brilliantly the next night. Re
peat. Sometimes you have to 
wonder if Hasek isnt playing 
better when hes drunk. His 
energy, belligerence, and speed
to the puck is phenomenal. 
Hasek couldnt save the 33-42-
7 Sabres though. In his rare 
flaws, when not at full exten
sion across the ice, he would go 
down too early and, like Cujo, 
leave the top of the net naked. A 
lesser goalie would have 
crumpled under the pressure of 
his daily shelling, an average of 
34 per game. In 59 games he 
saw 2,011 shots and stopped 
1850 of them for a 92 percent 
save average, best in the NHL. 
Why no Vezina for the third 
straight year? God only knows.
Martin Brodeur anchors the 
Devilss incredible defense. He 
played more minutes than any 
other goalie last year: 4,434 
minutes in 77 games. And hes 
young, borxl with talent that 
the NHL has been shaping with 
time. Brodeur was ranked sev
enth in the league last year in 
save percentage, 91.1 percent, 
but the Devils failed to make 
the playoffs, the first team in 
over 25 years to do that after 
winning the Stanley Cup the 
season before. He is also one of 
the few young goalies in this 
new generation who has perfect
mechanics. He does not flop 
around on the ice like Hasek 
and Cujo. He is a traditional 
stand-up goalie with incredible 
reflexes.
And how do they rank a few 
weeks into the new NHL season 
as of Saturday 19th?
Vanbiesbroukfive games, .98 GA,
96.5 percent saves, 143 shots on 
Roy  seven games, 2.55 GA, 
90.7 percent saves, 194 shots on 
Hasek - seven games, 2.72 GA,

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  21 October 199611
Columnist stakes reputation 
on post-season predictions
The Hot Comer
:O 5Vll HUccVoC
Two weeks ago I predicted (corectly) that the Atlanta Braves 
would win the National League 
pennant. Of course, I also pre
dicted (incorrectly) that they 
would b e playing the Texas Rang
ers in the World Series. Once 
again, I place my baseball credity on the line as I try to forethe future. This week I decide 
jo will win (or should win) Major 
gue Baseballs various 
tseason honors.
NATIONAL LEAGUE 
ost Valuable Player: There 
many players in the National 
gue who deserve award conieration. Mike Piazza, Chipper 
ies, and Barry Bonds are only 
w who should get many votes. 
two players who draw the 
lost attention, though, are 
jgSfckies outfielder Ellis Burks and 
Jgdres thirdbaseman Ken 
Caminiti. Burks did have the best 
son, statistically speaking, of 
j|y player in the league. But it 
Caminiti, not Burks, who led 
team to the NL Western DiviChampionship, and I choose 
.initi, not Burks, as the 
jgues MVP. 
gCy Young Award: There is no 
Seiibt that the Braves John 
oltz will be the unanimous 
winner of this award. Smoltzy, 
JgEo finished with league-lead
ing totals of 24 wins and 276 
strikeouts, dominated the oppo
sition like no one else. Marlin 
right-hander Kevin Brown will 
be a distant runner-up.
Rookie of the Year: Unlike 
recent years, 1996 did not pro
duce any outstanding rookies in 
the National League. Dodger out
fielder Todd Hollandsworth will 
win this award, but only by de
fault.
Manager of the Year:
PadreBruce Bochy and Cardinal 
Tony La Russa are the main con
tenders for this award. While San 
Diego had a more talented team, 
it was La Russas leadership that 
St. Louis reach its full 
potential, sweeping Bochys club 
in the playoffs and coming within 
one game of making a World Se
ries appearance. The Cards skip
per deserves this award most.
Trivia question: Who were 
the last four winners of the Na
tional League Rookie of the Year 
Award?
AMERICAN LEAGUE 
Most Valuable Player: The
junior circuit provides a long list 
of players who could win this 
awardAlbert Belle, Ken Griffey 
Jr., and Brady Anderson all come 
to mind. But the title willbe given 
either to Seattle shortstop Alex 
Rodriguez or Texas outfielder 
Juan Gonzalez. While the Base
ball Writers will most likely 
choose Rodriguez, Gonzalez is 
much more worthy. Seattle al
ready has several superstars 
(Griffey, Buhner, etc.), making 
Rodriguez considerably less vital 
to his team than Gonzalez. Also, 
the Rangers slugger carried his
ally earned the prize. My pick: 
your mom.
Rookie of the Year: As much 
as I dislike honoring a Yankee, 
Derek Jeter was by far the 
leagues most impressive rookie 
this season. New Yorks fresh
man shortstop not only performed 
very well on the field, but calmly 
endured the citys intense media 
coverage off the field as well.
Manager of the Year: Only 
one of two managers, Johnny 
Oates of the Rangers and Joe 
Torre of the Yankees, will win 
this title. Preseason expectations 
versus final results should deter
mine the awards recipient; most 
observers expected the Yankees 
to win at the start of the season, 
while many chose the Rangers to 
finish second or third. My choice 
is Oates, who guided Texas into
team to a division title, something 
young Alex was unable to do.
Cy Young Award: 1996 has 
been devastating for American 
League pitchingnot one hurler 
has consistently dominated bat
ters all season. Throughout the 
playoffs, baseball analysts have 
been labeling Yankee ace Andy 
Pettitte as the leading contender 
for the Cy Young Award. While I 
believe that Pat Hentgen of the 
Blue Jays should win the award, 
and that Charles Nagy and 
Mariano Rivera should be con
sidered, I dont think that any 
American League pitcher actu
Slmona Lo/Tartan Art Co-Editor
the playoffs for the first time in 
franchise history.
Trivia answer: The four pre
vious NL Rookies of the Year were 
all members of the Los Angeles 
Dodgers. Eric Karros (1992), Mike 
Piazza (1993), Raul Mondesi 
(1994), and Hideo Nomo (1995) 
hope that Todd Hollandsworth 
(1996?) can keep the streak alive.

Penalty power lies unused
The Pigskin Pundit
:O HroI1 HVuuCu
Most college football teams do 
not commit enough penalties to 
win a game. Thats right, not 
enough. The college football rule 
book is a wonderful thing. Suc
cessful teams learn it, know it, 
and exploit it. Before you say 
The Pundit has lost his marbles 
and flip to another section, con
sider the statistics.
During the October 12 week
end, 93 Division I and II college 
football contests occurred. In 56 
of those outings (60 percent), the 
team that was most penalized 
won the game. Over the October 
5 weekend, 85 games were 
played; 64 percent of the time (54 
games), the team that amassed 
the most penalty yardage was 
the victor.
Of the 17 games that featured 
ranked teams in the second week 
of October, the most penalized 
team won 11 times (65 percent). 
You can hardly blame the six 
highly penalized squads that lost
 four of them were ousted by 
undefeated teams.
Is all this still a bit cloudy? 
Lets look at the Associated 
Presss top five teams: Florida, 
Ohio State, Florida State, Ari
zona State, and Nebraska. With 
a combined 27-1 record through 
October 12, they have cumula
tively out-penalized their oppo
nents in 22 of 28 games, for a 
startling 78 percent.
If you exclude Nebraska (the 
only team with a loss in the group 
and whose punishing ground 
game avoids costly holding calls),
the figures rise to 20 of 23 and 87 
percent.
Lets take a look at why penal
ties are so good.
1) Bad penalties are better 
than bad plays. If a receiver 
knocks down a defender, instead 
of letting him intercept an er
rant throw, thats probably go
ing to be a net gain in yardage.
2) Offensive penalties are good 
for passing teams. Teams that 
throw the ball can afford to pro
tect their quarterback with aholding call because they can make a 
third down and 15.
3) Defensive penalties are 
good for goal-line defenses.
Its difficult for the offense 
to execute in the crammed 
spaces close to the end zone, 
so teams like Florida State 
(whose defense has given up 
one touchdown over five yards) 
can afford to bring the opposi
tion into the Red Zone.
4) Good teams get 
smart penalties, bad 
teams get stupid pen
alties. How many times 
have you seen State of U 
on defense hold Power
house College to third and 
five, only to jump offsides on 
a hard snap count? Other 
dumb fouls include false 
start, delay of game, personal 
fouls (which many good teams 
still get), intentional ground
ing, and special teams penal
ties.
So what penalties are 
good? Heres my top 
five:
Defensive holding.
Most people hate this 
one, but it has its uses. A defen
sive nightmare is second down 
and short. Why not give them five 
yards, a first down, and start 
over?
Twelve (too many) men on 
the field. This is one penalty 
with untapped advantages. Get
ting bashed on defense? Throw;- 
17 guys in the mix, kick thej 
offense around for a play, and} 
take the five-yard penalty.
Roughing the passer. Like! 
it or not, the quarterback is the 
most important player on the! 
field. More often than not, get-! 
ting him rattled is worth losing! 
15 yards.
Multiple infractions. Wheni 
a flag is thrown, usually every-i 
one know;s who did it. This is thei 
perfect time for the players on! 
the offending team to go nuts. 16 
your teammate jumpsi 
offside on a third and. 
three, its time fori 
some holding, pass in-i 
terference, and illegalhands to the face.
Defensive pass in-; 
terference. Many 
people are aware of the' 
NFLs enforcement oft 
this infraction. When a; 
defender smacks the; 
intended receiver too 
soon, the offense gets 
the ball, first down at 
the spot of the foul. If 
the receiver was in the 
end zone at the time 
of the slamming, they 
put the ball as close to 
the goal-line as they 
can get it. Not so in 
the collegiate game. 
What happens if you 
trip a blazing wideout! 
30 yards downfield? A; 
15-yard penalty. A; 
couple of defenders! 
slam a tight end in 
the end zone? A 15- 
yard penalty. The en
tire secondary knocks down their 
receivers and sits on them? A 
15-yard penalty. Its always, al
ways, a 15-yard penalty.

Intramural football champions crowned
By PAUL BOOTHE
aVolVu vnCol1 s7IlCo
The intramural touch football champi
onships were held this past Thursday, 
October 17, at Gesling Stadium. Since 
the IM football season started at the 
beginning of September, 50 teams were 
narrowed down to eight teams in four 
divisions to battle it out on the Astroturf 
to determine this years champions.
In the Minors championship, the unde
feated PKT Emeralds maintained thenperfect season by rolling over the previ
ously undefeated 69ers for a final score of 
42-0, led by game MVP fifth-year senior 
Matt Charlesworth. This win makes PKT 
the Minors champions two out of the last 
three years.
The Womens championship placed team
mate against teammate, as the Tartan 
Hoopers A (7-0) faced off against the Tar
tan Hoopers B (4r-2-l). The game took off 
to a slow start, as the score was 6-0 in favor 
of Hoopers A at the half. The team then 
followed their normal style of play, in
creasing the intensity of play in the third to 
take the score to 24-0. In the end, the
Hoopers A squad held off a fourth-quar
ter surge by the B squad to end the game 
2412, and won their fourth consecutive 
IM championship womens title. Hoopers

A senior Kelly Gaitens threw touch

Theta Xi Blue (4-2-1) left the 
Predators (4-3) on the low end of 
a 39-13 score to claim the Inter
mediate championship. Theta Xis 
quarterback, fifth-year senior 
Bruce Goldstein, took the game 
MVP. During the season, Theta 
Xis record was hurt when they 
lost two of their last three regular 
season games, while the Preda
tors won three straight games to 
earn the championship berth.
Beta Black-n-gold (5-3) de
feated Gang Greene (5-3) 22-6 in 
the Majors championship game. 
The score was close at halftime at 
13-6 in favor of Beta, but Betas 
solid defensive play widened the 
gap. A Gang Greene comeback 
was put out of reach when Beta 
forced a safety late in the game.

Men go 2-2-1 in recent games
By NATHAN STEINWALD
aVolVu MUuICo vlVtt 9oIleo
Saturday night, the mens soccer team 
played an unexpectedly tough Point Park 
team in a 2-0 loss. The loss came as a 
surprise to the team, which was caught 
looking ahead in their schedule. The loss 
gives the Tartans a 7-4-2 record for 
the season. Since last report, the Tar
tans have also lost to Brandis Uni
versity, tied University of Rochester, 
defeated Waynesburg College, and 
defeated Franklin & Marshal Col
lege. With their current standing the 
next games become critical to the 
teams post-season hopes.
Both the Brandis and Rochester 
games came at the end of a tough 
fur-game series of away games. The 
2-0 loss to Brandis on October 4 was 
disappointing to the team, especially 
because Brandis is a UAA opponent. 
The Rochester game on October 6, 
another conference match, was a 
hard-fought 1-1 tie that lasted 
through two overtime periods. These 
were the last two games the team had 
to fce on the road, as the moved into 
a seven game stretch of home games 
with a 5-2-2 record.
When the Tartans returned home 
for the first time in three weeks on 
October 9, they faced Waynesburg. 
Rebounding from the weekend, they 
took control of the game and pounded 
out one of their most decisive wins of 
the season by a score of 4-0. Four 
days later, on Sunday, October 13, 
the team played at home again 
against Franklin & Marshal. With 
home-field advantage and momen
tum from their last game, the team 
played strongly again, winning by a 3-1 
margin and raising hopes for the post 
season.
However, when the team met Point 
Park on Saturday, an NCAA berth was 
cast into serious doubt. Despite losing
sive troubles we just couldnt put the 
ball in the net. In the first half, the 
Tartans did create opportunities. Coach 
Nick Gaudioso said, <fWe had some very 
good chances early that we just couldnt 
finish. As the Tartans pushed the ball 
unsuccessfully toward the goal, the Point 
Park team hung in by stacking the penteam began to apply more offensive pressure. When a Point Park forward got the 
ball past the defense, there was nothing 
left between him and a one-on-one 
breakaway. Twenty yards out, he took a 
shot that deflected off of goalie Ben 
Kartzman and continued into the net. 
Following the goal, the team couldnt 
put the offense together to get the 
goals it needed. Junior forward Ja
son Buelow said, The Point Park 
team caught us looking ahead to some 
more difficult games and happened 
to put a goal in that we couldnt re
cover from. Gaudioso reflected the 
same sentiment when he said we 
had put a lot of pressure on ourselves 
to win. What the team had been 
anticipating are the games it plays 
against division powers Emory and 
Washington University in the next 
few weeks. If they had won all of their 
remaining games, including those 
two, they would have had excellent 
chances of making the NCAA cham
pionship tournament. Currently they 
are ranked eighth in the region. A 
strong push at the end of the season 
should have been enough to move 
them into the top four, the minimum 
required for the NCAA tournament.
The odds of this have been reduced, 
yet the team is still optimistic about 
its future. Im not unhappy with 
how they [the team] played said 
Gaudioso. The team still has a chance 
for a berth in the Eastern Collegiate 
Athletic Conference tournament. 
Buelow said, I am optimistic about

Tennis teams place in tough tourneys
By MASHA KOVARSKY
aVolVu MUuICo vlVtt 9oIleo
As the fall season comes to an end, the 
Tartan tennis teams face a few more 
challenges to prepare them for the com
ing spring with the UAA Champion
ships and other important tournaments. 
The mens team played at the Catholic 
University Tournament over the week
end, while the women will be going to the 
National Rolex Tournament on October 
24. Their records (3-1 men, 3-3 women) 
this season are outstanding, considering 
the Tartans had to play against very 
good teams such as Rochester and Al
legheny College.
The men competed at the Rolex Tour
nament held at Swarthmore College on 
October 4. Teams from all over the re
gion brought their best players to this 
event. The mens No. 1 doubles team, 
Navroze Marshall and Jim Freese, played 
well and advanced to the semi-finals, 
defeating teams from Cabrini, Franklin 
& Marshall, and Swarthmore. Although 
both players agreed that their goal was 
to win the tournament, it was not a bad 
loss. They were beaten by the winners of 
the finals while playing on sand courts, 
with which they are not familiar.
This weekend, the team was in Wash
ington, D.C. at the Catholic University 
Tournament, a more individual event. 
Freese said, We hope to win the doubles. 
This tournament wraps up an extraordi
nary fall season with a 3-1 record. 
Navroze Marshall, a junior, who became 
team captain last year, said, We only 
had one bad loss, and played much bet
ter than last year.
The team is already excited about the 
spring season. The first important tour
nament will be a conference match at 
Hilton Head, South Carolina on March 
21. They will also play a few matches 
before the Hilton Head tourney since the 
season starts in February. In April, the 
Tartans will compete at the University 
Athletic Association Tournament at
Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. 
This is a key tournament, because the 
top eight teams advance to the championships, and the winner of the championships will advance to nationals. Win
ning this championship is one of the 
Tartans team goals, said Marshall.
This season has also been very excit
ing and rewarding for the womens ten
nis team. At the Northeast Region Rolex 
Tournament at William Smith College, 
Keri Mills won the singles champion
ships for the second time  she will 
compete at the National Rolex Tourna
ment in Nashville, Tennessee. Last year/%B 
Mills had an exceptional 32-3 singles 
record, as well as a 22-3 doubles mark, 
and she also became CMUs first AllAmerican womens tennis player and 
received All-University Athletic Asso
ciation honors. With Mills on the team, 
CMU had a great 16-8 record. Fresh
man Christina Sun, the teams ;No. 2 
singles player, played Mills in the finals. 
The Tartans top doubles team, Mills 
and Sun, won the doubles title as well.
Last weekend the women participated 
in the Capital Tennis Classic held at 
Catholic University in Washington, D.C; 
Mills, Sun, and sophomore Jillian 
Watkins took the top three places in the 
singles tournament, and sophomore 
Miklane Fedorowich took sixth. In the 
doubles event, Mills and Sun again gave 
a terrific performance to win the event.
Last Monday, the Tartans played 
Washington & Lee Universityranked 
second in the nation last year. The match 
was very good practice for the team since 
they will be playing some toughteams in 
the spring. The women are looking for
ward to competing against other UAA 
teams at Emory, and hope that they will 
do better than last year. The players say 
that although this season was short, it 
was very competitive and has prepared 
them for the spring. Sophomore Julie 
Balch, who was a finalist at the Catholic 
tournament, said, We have a solid team, 
its a lot stronger this year.
Womens soccer defeats Seton Hill, Catholic, loses four
By ELLEN BELDNER
aVolVu vlVtt9oIleo
With four games left in the sea
son, the CMU womens soccer 
team stands at a crossroad be
tween two very different season 
outcomes. After a succession of 
six games between October 4 and 
16, the team now stands with an 
overall record of 7-5-1. Despite 
this relatively strong overall 
record, the Tartans have either 
tied or lost every University Ath
letic Association conference soc
cer game they have played this 
season, with a UAA record of 0- 
3-1. And with three of the last 
four games against UAA power
houseslike Emory University and 
Washington University, the 
womens team is going to have an 
uphill battle to fight if it wants to 
keep up the winning pace it set at
the beginning of the season. Our 
UAA record is not as good as wed 
hoped at the beginning of the 
sea,st5n, said sophomore forward 
Catherine Duda. Weve had a lot 
of overtime and losses. But weve 
showed well, I think, and as long 
as we put together what weve 
been working on all season, we 
should be able to pull through [in 
the end].
The team played its second and 
third UAA games, both away, 
against Brandeis University on 
October 4 and University of Roch
ester on October 6. The Tartans 
lost to Brandeis 32, despite two 
goals by junior forward Kim 
Umeda, which tied the match. 
However, Brandeis scored the 
winning goal 20 minutes into the 
second half, and the Tartans were 
not able to fight back. On October 6, sophomore goalkeeper Lind
say Smith and the Tartan de
fense squad held back Rochesters 
offense, which attacked with more 
than 25 shots on CMUs goal. 
Rochester still managed a 2-0 
win over the Tartans, bringing 
CMUs UAA record to 0-3-1. 
Were really hoping we can win 
our upcoming UAA games, said 
captain and senior midfielder Jill 
Sincaglia. I think well be able 
to. We have the strength.
The picture brightened consid
erably at the October 10 home 
game against Seton Hill College 
and at the October 13 game 
against Catholic University. The 
Tartans won both games 1-0, 
with scores by senior midfielder 
Jill Sincaglia at Seton Hill and 
Duda at Catholic University. 
Well, we didnt play as well as 
we would have liked to, said 
Duda of the Catholic University
game. We didnt have as many 
scoring opportunities as we usu
ally do. But we got one in, and 
thats what mattered.
Sandwiched between these 
two wins was a 1-0 loss on Octo
ber 12 at Gettysburg College. 
After nine saves by Smith, 
Gettysburg still pulled away 
with a score, leaving the Tar
tans 7-4-1. And then, at the 
October 16 game against Seton 
Hill, the Tartans lost 1-0. As 
the team moves into its last four 
games against Bethany College 
and the three UAA teams, its 
standing is at 751.
Weve had a lot of overtime 
and losses, said Duda. But 
weve showed well, I think, 
and as long as we put together 
what weve been working on 
all season, we should be able 
to pull through.

Cross country places well at UAA Championships
By CHRIS CANNON
aVolVu ,11I1lVul me91 s7IlCo
CMUs mens and womens cross coun
try teams both had strong showings 
against ranked opposition at the Uni
versity Athletic Association Champion
ships last Saturday.
The women had an especially strong 
race, placing three runners among the 
top seven finishers; including second 
overall finisher Margaret Powers in 
18:24 over the 3.1 mile course.
Almost all of them ran their fastest 
time ever, said womens coach Dario 
Donatelli, Theyre all freshmen and 
sophomores, and I think they ran their 
first UAA very well.
Margaret ran a tremendous race, she 
ran 46 seconds faster than her previous 
personal record, said Donatelli.
The CMU women were third with 72 
points, behind Washingtion University 
(54 points) and Emory (55 points), but 
well ahead of Brandeis (119 points).
Donatelli described the course as Pan
cake flat. There wasnt a hill to be found.
There was nothing that even re
sembled a hill, but that was good for
the second and third mile, said sopho
more Maureen McGranaghan who was 
sixth at 18:47.
Coming off a week of being sick, I 
was happy with the way I ran, said 
McGranaghan, who was just two sec
onds off her personal record.
While four of the top five women fin
ishers reached their personalbest times, 
the men had a bit more trouble.
As flat as a pool table, said mens 
coach Gary Meckley, Being a hill-running team, I thought we did very well. 
It doesnt compare to anything else 
weve been on, said sophomore Kristo 
Kriechbaum, who was unhappy with 
the way he ran. I mean you cant run in 
Pittsburgh without finding a hill. 
Rochester, ranked in the top five in 
the country, was dominant with 26 
points. Washington was second (57 
points) and Brandeis was third (91 
points). Although it initially appeared 
that they had finished higher, CMU 
was fourth (100 points) in what 
Meckley calls Probably the strongest 
cross country conference in the coun
try. Nine CMU runners finished in 
front of Brandeiss fourth and fifth
places, but only the first seven count 
towards the scoring.
Being a hill running team, I thought 
that we did very, very well, said Meckley.
14th overall finisher Kenn Oldham 
led the way for the Tartans in 26:03, 
followed by Kriechbaum (17th, 26:12), 
Josh Donner (18th, 26:14), Seb Ziesler 
(25th, 26:30), Scott Moore (267h, 26:31), 
and Bryan Meyers .(27th, 26:35).
The CMU womens team brought eight 
runners to the meet. After Powers and  
McGranaghan came Andrea Byrnes (7th,; 
18:48), Melissa Sloan (25th, 19:43), Amy , 
Antocci (32nd, 19:53), Elizabeth Currid' 
(40.th, 20:24), Alison Currid (52nd, 20:48), 
and Erin Stapelfeld (57th, 20:59).
Regionals for both squads are in three 
weeks. The top three teams at regionals 
advance to nationals. McGranaghan 
said, The competition we saw this week 
is comparable to regionals. It will defi
nitely be a challenge.
Meckley said, I think we have a really 
excellent team, and a good chance at 
making nationals.
Theres no reason why we cant make 
nationals if everyone runs the way they 
can, Kriechbaum said.

eremajor players in this years 
ntemational Festival, which fo:used on Latin America and the 
Caribbean. Through lectures, 
novies, concerts, and other 
vents, the CMU community 
lad the opportunity to taste the 
lavor of the exciting culture of 
;hese regions.
Anne Witchner, director of stulent activities and coordinator 
if the 1996 festival, said it pro
notes cultural awareness and 
ducates students about the di
versity in other world regions.
This year, over 60 events have 
been incorporated  into the 
ichedule to provide social, edu
cational, and cultural aware
ness, she said. Immediate feed
back from students, faculty, 
staff, and guests to the univer
sity indicates that people have 
been excited by the programs 
and are happy to have the expo
sure to the opportunities pre
sented, from Latin dance les
sons to learning more about 
NAFTA.
Michael Groat, coordinator for 
Student Life of Suiteside and a 
inember of the 1996 Interna
tional Festival Committee, 
agreed. He said the festival is an
excellent way to educate stu
dents because it is informal and 
entertaining.
I think the festival presents 
information about different parts 
of the world to people in a very 
non-preachy way, he said. It 
provides the opportunity for stu
dents to learn about different 
ways of life in a non-threatening 
manner. The festival creates

he said. I didnt want anyone to 
be bored.
Another activity that took 
place during the Festival was

takes the information to a much

to a big lecture.

Derek Walcott, a 1992 Nobel Prize 
winning poet who spoke last 
Wednesday as part of the Inter
national Festival. The selection 
of poems that followed over the 
next hour, however, were not read 
in a soft tone. Rather, the highly 
acclaimed poet and playwright 
justified his statement in 
a later explanation. As 
one approaches finality, 
the tone [of my poetry] is 
self-forgiving, self-ap
praising, and very quiet, 
he said.
This statement came 
from a man whose past, 
critics say, has been one 
that would demand a sense of 
finality and placement in the 
world. Bom in St. Lucia in the 
West Indies, Walcott has used 
the dualities of his roots, such as 
his mixed families, his attraction 
to both his Caribbean culture and 
formal European culture in writ
ing, and his struggle against tra
ditional views of the Caribbean, 
as themes for his poetry.
This paid off when the poet won 
the Nobel Literature Prize. His 
award was one reason that many
take advantage of it, said junior

major.

The talks main focus was one 
of redemption, as Walcott ex
plained his feeling that his na
tive land has been labeled incor
rectly for its lack of contributions 
to history.
The tragedy is that we have 
been afflicted with a descrip
tion of ourselves which we do 
not accept, but which contin

discuss how these achievements 
are measured differently in

natural and visual images of his 
childhood, in an attempt to dispel 
false preconceptions surrounding 
the Caribbean.
When asked for a specific mes

responded modestly, The only 
example is for writers and artists 
not to stop working. No matter 
what happens, they should fol

Students who attended the lec

College Republicans provide political forum to voice view;

% We are all in some degree, some 
way, shape, or form, all Republicans,
lsaid Ellen Beldner, public relations
- /officer of the College Republicans and 
'freshman technical writing and sta'tistics major. Last Wednesday, the
 College Republicans held their first
 meeting of the semester to talk about 
upcoming events they will be spon
soring, issues that should concern
-'Republicans on campus, and to watch 
/the second presidential debate, 
;* which was televised live from San 
Diego. Fifteen students attended the 
/ fleeting to find out what the College
 ^Republicans were all about and what 
4}he meeting would include  and to
'-eat some pizza.
This is our introductory meeting 
and well be explaining our mission 
'and what we hope to 
accomplish,Beldner said.
She said that although this was 
sthe first meeting of the year, and the 
second oeVg meeting over the past 
( two years, conservative students on 
; campus do have a forum to voice 
| their political concerns.
The 90-minute de
bate dominated 
most of the meeting.
Afterward, students 
discussed their 
thoughts on the 
presidential plat
forms.
Aaron Green
house, a first-year 
CS graduate stu
dent, said, He 
picked an issue, the 
economic package, 
and tried to show 
that he was trust
worthy, but he didnt 
talk about why he 
thinks it would work 
when he was given a 
direct opportunity to 
do so.
Beldner said,
Clinton did a bet
ter job answering 
the questions, but 
Dole was more re
laxed.
A few people stayed after the de
bate to talk with club officers about 
the events that the College Republi
cans will sponsor before and after 
the election, as well as some of the 
goals of the club.
The College Republicans have a
few ideas that they 
would like to imple
ment before the elec
tion, which reflects 
some of the general phi
losophy that founded 
the club.
The political scene 
on this campus is 
pretty dim, most of the 
time, said Andrew 
Davenport, president 
of the organization and 
a junior computer sci
ence major.
We want to foster po
litical growth on cam
pus and champion 
some of the ideals of 
the Republican party. 
He mentioned that 
the club likes to take 
part in campaign work 
for local Republican 
politicians, such as 
Rick Santorums cam
paign two years ago. 
We went out and spread a lot of 
literature around Squirrel Hill, 
which was neat because we got to 
meet a lot of people we otherwise

wouldnt have contact with, he
Beldner said the intentions ofth 
club are not just limited to prom0 
ing the Republican party.
One of their immediate plans is 
set up an information table on can 
pus a week before the election wit 
information on the three major pregj 
dential candidates, Clinton, Dole 
Perot, as well as the Democratic, He 
form, and Republican parties.
We care about promoting polity 
awareness and providing general ii 
formation, she said.
They also hope to set up an infor 
mation discussion with a polity 
speaker.
The club plans to meet once a wee 
until the election to discuss more is 
sues, but they arent sure what thei 
schedule will be after the election.
Many students at the meeting fe] 
that Dole probably wouldnt win, bu

Speaker explores issue of racism
BY ANDREW WANG
aVolVu vlVtt9oIleo
Dinesh DSouza, author of 
the controversial interna
tional bestseller are su7 Ct 
AVcI1p, discussed the topic 
Upcoming Elections and 
Race Relations as part of the 
H&SS Controversial Speak
ers Series on Wednesday, 
October 9, in the University 
Center auditorium.
DSouza, a native of 
Bombay, India, came to the 
U.S. in 1978 as an exchange
movement, and affirmative ac
tion. He demonstrated and ex
plained the underlying problems 
in the existing public policies of 
race, and then pointed the di
rection in which existing poli
cies and new policies need to 
head in order to solve some of 
these problems.
DSouza said that the issue of 
race was conspicuously absent 
from the public rhetoric of the 
presidential campaign. We 
have had, for the past couple of 
years, a triangular dispute over 
the subject of affirmative action

student. He served as editor 
for The Dartmouth Review, 
a conservative campus news
paper, while he was a student 
at Dartmouth College. After 
graduation, he took part in a 
research fellowship at the 
American Enterprise Insti
tute, a conservative think 
tank in Washington, D.C., and 
later served in the White 
House during the Reagan ad
ministration as senior domes
tic policy analyst. Currently, 
he is a John M. Olin Fellow at 
the American Enterprise In
stitute.
The End of Racism has 
been described as the first 
comprehensive look into the 
nature, history and meaning 
of racism i n the United States. 
DSouza also authored the

gI:eoVg s7UcVlICu) are (CgI6
lIc1 Ct AVce Vu7i veY Cu HVp6
nU1i
DSouza began the discus
sion by giving a background 
of the politics of race, start
ing from the civil rights move
ment and moving into the cur
rent presidential campaign. 
He then explained the under
lying principles and theories 
of racism, the civil rights
and race-based policies, he said. 
This dispute has pitted the Re
publican Congress on one hand 
against the Clinton administra
tion on the other, with the courts 
taking an intermediate  per
haps moderating position 
somewhere in between.
According to DSouza, the Re
publican Congress has intro
duced a number of bills, none 
which has passed, but which 
would end all race-based deci
sions in government policies, 
while the Clinton administra
tion has taken a look at racebased policies and decided that 
nothing needs changing.
I would summarize contem
porary Supreme Court jurispru
dence on affirmative action this 
way: the court has basically con
cluded it is OK to discriminate, 
but not too much, said DSouza.
DSouza said that the basic 
underlying problem of the po
litical rhetoric of race is the 
headlong conflict between the 
equality of rights for individu
als and the equality of results 
for groups. He said that the ba
sic premises of the civil rights 
movement are that equality of 
rights for individuals will lead 
to equality of results for groups, 
and the theory of cultural relativism, which assumes that 
all cultures are equal. Thirty 
years after Martin Luther 
King Jr., weve discovered 
that premise is false, said 
DSouza.
DSouza challenged the 
theory of proportional repre
sentation, which is the basis 
of affirmative action. The 
theory states that the racial 
breakdown of employees in 
companies and students in 
schools should roughly repre
sent the racial breakdown of 
surrounding society. DSouza 
asked, Why do we assume 
that in the absence of dis
crimination every group in 
our society will fan out into 
every college, university, ev
ery sector of the work force, 
and indeed every single com
pany at roughly or even pre
cisely its ratio in the sur
rounding society?
DSouza said cultural rela
tivism may have been a very 
valuable method for fighting 
racism in the 1960s and 70s 
at the beginning of the civil 
rights movement, when the 
attitude of the nation towards 
race relations was different. 
He said that cultural relativ
ism is today a deadly ob
stacle.
It prevents us from ac
knowledging that some cul
tures simply compete better 
than others. It prevents us 
from acknowledging and de
veloping public policy that 
will work to confirm and 
strengthen cultures of de
cency and that will work to 
undermine, change, and 
transform cultures of irre
sponsibility, said DSouza.
According to DSouza, cul
ture refers to many different 
attributes of a group, such as 
savings rates, study habits, 
rates of business formation, 
the teaching of entrepreneur
ial skills to young people, and 
the strengthening of families.
I would argue that a raceneutral policy has got to be 
combined with a serious ef
fort concentrated in the pri
vate sector that is aimed at 
the reforming of American 
culture, he said.

Lectures shed light on 
Latin American culture
By BETTY SHEA
aVolVu MUuICo vlVtt9oIleo
The International Festival, held between October 16 to 20, featured a 
kaleidoscope of lectures ranging from Andean religions to Chicano satire to 
the creation of steel pan instruments. Such unusual topics drew crowds of 
students, parents, and staff, seeking answers to long-harbored questions 
such as What happened.to Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid? Which 
Venezuelan tribe makes the best Casabe bread? Are there really people who 
study these topics?
The lectures were not organized overnight. Anne Witchner, director of 
Student Activities, said, We send out a notification 11 months ago, asking for 
suggestions [of possible lecture topics] .... We try to get well-rounded and 
representative speakers. It took a lot of planning  we had to find people 
[lecturers] who would be interesting to students, and we had to make sure 
they did not cost, like, 30 thousand dollars.
Arranging the lectures did not always go as smoothly as planned. With so 
many things to coordinate in the International Festival, unexpected events 
are bound to appear. Witchner said that originally, the International Festi
val committee had arranged for Edward J ames Olmos, one of the actors in the 
movie vlVu7 Vu7 zegIkeo, to speak during the festival.
He [Olmos] had to release himself from the schedule to make another 
movie. It would have been great to have him speak here. But part of planning
the event is learning to 
deal with disappoint
ments like this, said 
Witchner.
Most presentations 
were conducted with 
the goal of promoting 
awareness of the Latin 
American culture 
among Carnegie Mellon 
students.
When asked about 
what he hopes to accom
plish by his two lec
tures, Latin American 
Religions: The Andean 
Case and Bolivia: The 
Case of Butch Cassidy 
and the Sundance Kid, 
Erick Langer, associate 
professor of history in 
Carnegie Mellon Uni
versity, .stresses the 
importance of breaking down barriers between cultures created by a mutual 
lack of understanding. Said Langer, What we need to get away from is 
stereotypes. Regions like Latin America are complex and have real people 
living in them that actively choose how to deal with things around them. They 
[Latin Americans] are not just a mass of people out there ... they are actors 
with a sense of ethics and they act on it.
Langer said, What I am trying to do is to use these two Americans [Butch 
Cassidy and the Sundance Kid] to grab Americans attention and use them 
; as a bridge to understand a different world'which is not America.'
Another major speaker in the International Festival is Toney Anaya who 
served as governor of New Mexico from 1983 through 1986, and is currently 
the advisor to the Government of Mexico. Anaya is heavily involved in issues 
such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Indeed, his 
lecture Hispanic Awareness and NAFTA, reflects his concern for the 
position of Hispanics both within the American society and internationally.
Anaya believes tht to bridge the gap between American Hispanics and the 
rest of the American society, efforts must be made on both sides. Anaya said, 
If we are locking ourselves out, we have no one to blame. And we have to 
move beyond that .... We. as Hispanics and Latinos, can be the bridge in 
insisting that changes come about.
Contrary to the seriousness of the intentions of the lectures, most presen
tations were conducted in a light-hearted atmosphere. One of the lecture 
rooms, the Connon Room, was furnished casually with a few round tables. 
Soup and refreshments were provided. John Frechione, associate director of 
the Center for Latin American Studies at the University of Pittsburgh, 
conducted his presentation in the Connon room. He punctuated his presen
tation (Oui' Daily Bread: Agriculture and Food Production in the Venezuelan 
Tropical Jungle) with colorful slides depicting the process by which Casabe, 
a bread that serves as the main staple of many Venezuelans, are made from 
the tuber crop manioc. When asked why he studies what he studies, 
Frechione jokingly said, I was always interested in tropical forests and I 
thought Tarzan was quite neat.
All in all, several lecturers felt that the International Festival was quite a 
success. Commenting on the attendance of his first lecture, Langer noted, 
The tabls were all filled up. People brought up great questions too. It was 
altogether a great turnout for something as esoteric as Andean religions. 
Echoing Langers sentiments, Anaya said, I think that the International 
Festival is an excellent idea and I compliment the University, the students, 
and others who have been involved with it.
Anaya reminds us, however, that our efforts can not stop at this level. The 
politician said, My major concern ... would be that we not utilize it [the 
festival] as three days or four days out of a year and go on about business as 
usual. Instead, we should try to use this time and this festival as a way to try 
to motivate the student body and try to find other ways to keep the same spirit 
... and make it a year long effort. To use it [the festival] as kind of a launching 
pad would serve a much more useful purpose.

Campus protests disappoint student
ON MY WAY OUT
:O soIc vVgxpVu
You know the 60s, back when col
lege students were protesting about 
everything from the Vietnam War to 
not enough pot in the vending ma
chines? (Apparently, they didnt do 
Buggyin the 60s because they had 
the time and energy to protest con
stantly.)
Documentaries and old war sto
ries from protesters of yester-year 
always put a glorified image of the 
college protest in my head. I picture 
a student stuck in a police car, with 
thousands of supporters surround
ing the car and passing sandwiches 
and drinks to their martyr.
Since my tenure at CMU 
began, I have had the op
portunity to attend a few 
protests  all of them in
credibly dull. My freshman 
year, a bunch of students 
were upset that the top 
floors in Hunt Library were 
going to close at midnight, 
so they had a sit-in in pro
test. Hmm, nerds fighting 
for their right to be nerds 
until the wee hours of the 
night  I skipped that one.
Any student looking for a 
protest can always wait for 
Vincent Eirene to show up.
It wont be a long wait. Hell 
help you protest everything 
from the Software Engi
neering Institutes exist
ence to hunger in the world. 
Unfortunately, no one will 
show up and no one will 
care. Eirene isnt even a 
student here, so his pro
tests kind of ruin the whole 
college movement thing.
Of course there was the 
famous protest against 
CMUs attempt to ban the
porno bboards. Hmm, nerds who 
couldnt get dates fighting for their 
right to look at low-resolution, na
ked people on a computer  I had a 
class.
Now, the porno thing could have 
made for a great protest. However, 
instead of people gathering in front 
of Warner Hall (when Mehrabian 
wasnt even there) to make speeches, 
we should have had naked people 
walking across campus to prove that 
CMU students have a right to wit
ness such images.
All Im asking for before I leave is 
one good protest. I want to see stu
dents get really pissed off about 
something, take action, and make 
some noise. For example, doesnt 
anyone find it odd that Baker and 
Porter Halls are connected? Isnt it 
time we had a sit-in in favor of these 
buildings being separated? Really, 
buildings need their autonomy.
Not only are buildings on this cam
pus connected, we still have print
ers that dont print double sided 
pages. The trees! The trees! What
we need is a giant papier mache<jn 
the cut to protest this gross negli
gence of proper environmental be
havior. It could be in the shape of a 
cucumber. ,
On a more serious note, after all 
these years of political activity, stu
dents are still not allowed to bri$g 
firearms onto campus. We need rifje 
racks in each dorm and academic 
building. If not, students should 
storm Warner Hall and throw tujrkey sandwiches out the windows, y
Need I even mention the toilet- pfeper on this campus? Im not going to 
get into it again  let me just leave 
it at: ow! [
Block the entrances to buildings, 
boycott classes and Highlandej, 
bomb every staff persons email ac
count, get funky! I want to see^a 
protest!

Journeys discuss personal experiences
By ANNE MARIE DEVINE
aVolVu vlVtt9oIleo
The international sign posts lining 
the Cut informed students about the 
physical distance between Pittsburgh 
and various Latin American coun
tries, but the Personal Journeys se
ries can show the cultural differences 
between the two.
Personal Journeys is a series of 
small, informal talks by students, 
professors, and other CMU commu
nity members who have lived or stud
ied in Latin America and the Carib
bean. Topics ranged from the Internet 
in Honduras to Latin dance lessons 
to cultural considerations while do
ing business in Latin America.
Linda Melville, foreign student ad
visor in the Office of International 
Education, organized the speeches. 
Her goal was to have ordinary people 
talk in a small format where ques
tions were welcome, to avoid the aloof 
presence that often comes with big 
lectures. To accomplish this, the talks 
were held in some of the smaller meet
ing rooms in the University Center.
Melville chose speakers by contact
ing all of the international students 
from Latin American countries. She 
also spoke to professors from the for
eign language department and other
Latino faculty members. A few speak
ers were from community groups such 
as the Caribbean Association and the 
Latin American Cultural Association.
One of the students who spoke was 
Tushar Dubey, a junior studying eco
nomics with a double major in policy 
and management. Tushar spent four 
months in Costa Ric last year study
ing the economics of the area and 
efforts to start sustainable agricul
ture projects. In his very enthusias
tic talk, he shared his experiences of 
learning Spanish in a month, seeing 
the incredible sights of Costa Rica, 
and his views on ecotourism and the 
future of the country. [I agreed to 
give the talk] because this experi
ence changed me so much, I always 
like to talk about it, Tushar said. I 
hope I can get it through to the CMU 
community that you can study abroad 
and learn a lot.
Jacobo Carrasquel, a computer sci
ence professor, spoke of Venezuela, 
his home country, which he deemed 
the least known Caribbean country. 
He said that not many people know 
where Venezuela is and how great 
the tourism is there.
In 10 days, you can visit four coun
tries  the city of Caracas, the jungle 
of the Amazon, the mountains of 
Marida, and the island of Margarita,
he said.
One of the best-attended speeches 
was Eric Langers, entitled Bolivijji: 
The Case of Butch Cassidy and th|e 
Sundance Kid. Langer, a history pro
fessor, is the only Latin Americanist 
in his department. He has done re
search on the economics of Tupiz&, 
where records that supposedly de^l 
with the two American bandits ai|e 
stored.
He normally doesnt speak on thjs 
topic, in order not to be seen by th!e 
Bolivians as an amateur aficionado 
looking for money and fame. I gave 
this talk so students would see that 
members of the University commu
nity have been involved in and af
fected by these areas, so they cajn 
connect [the festival] with re4l 
people. Melville said, Personal Jour
neys is a way of celebrating how in
ternational we are. Twenty percent 
of CMU students are from other coun
tries, here on student visas. CMUhds 
one of the largest ratios of interna
tional to U.S. students in colleges 
around the country, she said. I
Melville guessed that six to seven 
percent of the international students 
are from Latin America. It is a goad 
way to introduce yourself to the re^t 
of the world and get skills that yoju 
will get a lot of mileage out of. {

Sexual Assault Advisors spread awareness with programs

spective on life and an interest
ing way of looking at things. Af
ter only hearing him speak for an 
hour you can catch a lot of his 
culture, said Kate Tellers, an 
H&SS freshman.
Another H&SS freshman, Nick 
Zitelli, was impressed as well. I 
think that the way he portrays 
his homeland shows he is very 
passionate, he said.
Similarly, in the true spirit of
the International Festival, 
Abhijit Govindaswamy, a fresh
man at CIT, said, Im from 
Trinidad, so I could relate to most 
of his speech, especially [what 
was said] about the different cul
tures, he said.
After the address, a number of 
people stayed to get autographs 
from Walcott and to sample some 
of the Festivals international 
cooking which was laid out for 
the reception.

On Wednesday, October 9th, the Sexual 
Assault Advisors sponsored a day of 
events that invited the campus commu
nity to learn about sexual violence, pre
ventive measures, and ways to support 
victims of sexual assault. A Sexual Vio
lence Awareness Day, held in conjunc
tion with the YWCAs Week Without 
Violence, allowed for the presentation of 
information about issues of sexual vio
lence and promote on-campus programs 
dedicated to bringing awareness to the 
community about sexual assault. Jeff 
Lauzon, Health Educator, holds a new 
position created within Health Services 
specifically to educate on university wide 
health issues where the information is of 
particular importance to students. He 
stated, d, large goal of programs such as 
this, is to make it easier for victims to 
speak up and break the silence by making (campus) support programs known. 
Lauzon attributes much of the organi
zation of Sexual Violence Awareness Day 
to Kerri Ullucci, gender issues intern for 
Student Life and coordinator of Sexual 
Assault Advisors.
Ullucci has acted as coordinator for 
Sexual Assault Advisors for three of the 
programs five years. She said, We are a 
group of about 30 faculty, staff, and stu
dents, both men and women, who Uu6
7eowC around 1520 hours of training in 
counseling skills. Advisors are also taught 
about legal processes, medical care, and 
resource referral for survivors of sexual 
violence.
A list containing the name, affiliation, 
and phone number of each Sexual As
sault Advisor goes out to all RAs and 
academic advisors.
Everyones number is available, rather 
than a hotline, because this gives the 
caller an opportunity to speak with who
ever he/she might be more comfortable
with, said Ullucci. Three of the pro
grams available throughout the course of 
the day were run by the Sexual Assault 
Advisors.
These programs dealt with campus 
rape and the resources available to help 
survivors. It also offered ways to support 
and help in the healing of victims of 
sexual assault.
Other features of the day included an 
information table, and a YWCA anti
violence rally co-sponsored by the Uni
versity of Pittsburgh. A workshop dis
cussing the issue of mens role in rape 
prevention was led by Jim Donnelly, a 
licensed psychologist at St. Francis Hos
pital.
This presentation addressed ways in 
which men can help to prevent rape and 
create a non-sexist environment on cam
pus. Barbara Smith, assistant vice presi
dent for Human Resources, and Everett 
Tademy, director of Equal Employment 
Opportunity and Affirmative Action, presented an interactive workshop that ad
dressed the definition of sexual harass
ment and how to end it in the classroom 
and on campus.
Carnegie Mellons Sexual Harass
ment policy and where to go for help in 
a crisis situation were also discussed.
Ullucci said, The most disappoint
ing aspect of the day was the lack of 
attendance.
She said, Midsemester break and 
exams may have been a factor, but 
sexual assault is an issue that people 
are not comfortable with.
It is not only a crisis, but a crisis 
involving sex; it is difficult if you are a 
survivor to come out to an event like 
this.
Ullucci has found that, large pro
grams are not necessarily the most 
appropriate on this campus.
The biggest issue for people who 
work with counseling is the role that 
men play, both as victims and as assailants. Men communicate in differ, 
ent ways and communicate sadness in 
different ways than women, and issues 
of masculinity and sexuality are often 
overlooked, said Ulucci.
Ullucci states that the only way to 
effectively prevent sexual violence is 
to bring awareness to both genders.
Men have a role in stopping one 
another, just as women watch over 
one another... protecting each other " 
says Ullucci.
The best aspect of the day is that 
people know that we are here. Edu
cational outreach plays a large part 
in helping people to speak out, said 
Ulucci.
Anyone interested in information 
concerning sexual violence aware
ness and related issues or learning 
more about becoming a sexual as
sault advisor should feel free to con
tact Kerri Ullucci at 
ky22@andrew.cmu.edu.
Festival lets students 
explore their roots
!iewaWrP, ty'S Iusl Pa
members who have Latin Ameri
can ties.
The Festival is intentionally 
planned to overlap with Family 
Weekend, Witchner said. This 
provides a larger audience base, 
expands the programming over 
the weekend, and importantly, 
showcases our University. Many 
programs this weekend focus on 
the talents and artistry of our 
own community. The Forbes Gal
lery show features the works of 
several Latino art majors. The 
Carnegie Mellon Philharmonic 
and the Concert Choir both dem
onstrate the talents of students 
from the Music Department.
John Arroyo, a junior electri
cal and computer engineering 
major and a member of the In
ternational Festival Committee, 
said the importance of the Inter
national Festival emanates from 
its role in fostering cultural 
awareness as well as bringing 
students together. The campus 
can benefit from the Interna
tional Festival because it allows 
students to participate in an oncampus social event. There usu
ally arent many of these. At the 
same time, it exposes students 
to other cultures,Arroyo said.
By showing works and having 
performers and speakers, the 
festival lets students see how 
people from other cultures work 
and contribute to the world.
Prevost agreed. The Interna
tional Festival brings people to
gether, she said. It is a great 
opportunity to learn about the 
world. It offers a wide variety of 
activities to folks. For me, Im 
really happy to see it going on.
Groat sees the International 
Festival as being a strong force 
in informing both non-Latino and 
Latino people about Latin Ameri
can culture.
He said, It not only educates 
non-Latin American students, 
but it allows native Latin Ameri
cans to better appreciate their 
roots and to celebrate their com
munity. The festival celebrated 
different groups of people by 
making them accessible to all of 
us.
Next years festival will cel
ebrate Africa. Anyone interested 
in working on the 1997 Interna
tional Festival Committee should 
contact Heather Midkiff, pI7SItt.

Festival features native Latin, Caribbean programs
Events bring culture to campus

One of the best activities of this weekends Interna
tional Festival was the concert performed by Carnegie 
Mellon Concert Choir (directed and conducted by 
Robert Page, Director of Choral Studies at CMU). 
The sheer number of activities during this weekends 
International Festival at made ones head -spin, but 
ne was sure to walk away with a taste of foreign 
lands. The International Festival Concert, however, 
Was a colorful, exciting presentation of CMUs vocal 
and instrumental musical talent.
Presented primarily in Spanish, the songs told 
stories of strength and courage, biblical prophets 
praise to God, and other poetic folk stories. The 
texture of the music gave the sensation of being held
by a larger force; the choir seemed to capture the 
audience, surrounding it with the warmth and 
beauty of the voices. The perfo rmance was clearly 
remarkable.
Accompanied by Mark Carver, the first songs were 
psalms such as (1VgpC yoV1IgIeoC by Jean Berger 
(text by Jorge de Lima), and from the Book of Lam
entations, WVpeulVcICue1 7e MeoepIV1 (oCnrelV by 
Alberto Ginastera. These songs of praise, remorse, 
and sorrow paint an exquisite portrait of culture in 
keeping with the international theme.

The weather in Pittsburgh this past weekend 
may have been cold and rainy, but here on campus 
students were able to escape into the hot, steamy 
culture of Latin America and the Caribbean. For 
five days, beginning on Wednesday, the Interna
tional Festival provided students and their fami
lies with an ar
ray of events to 
help enrich 
their under
standing and re
spect for the culture of Latin 
America.
The Interna
tional Festival 
is an annual program that began in 1991 in an 
effort to increase multicultural awareness within 
the University. The festival cycles through four 
themes: Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, 
Africa, and Europe. The four cycles allow students 
to see each theme once during their four years of 
study at CMU.
The festival, coordinated by the Office of Student 
Activities, is a result of the combined effort of many 
student organizations and academic departments. 
Working together, the groups are able to provide a 
variety of cultural programs and events that are 
sure to pique everyones interests.
The events and activities of this years Interna
tional Festival were as diverse as the culture of the 
region itself. While Learn the Macarena may not 
be considered the most culturally enlightening pro
gram, each day other programs, including lectures, 
activities, and exhibits, did just that. Fortunately, 
the University Center was available to hold many 
of the events, eliminating the need for tents and 
sitting outside in the cold to enjoy the festival as in 
past years.
From lectures to films to sports, there seemed to 
be something for everyone. An entire culture is 
difficult to represent because it is composed of so 
many variables. The festival managed to encom
pass much of the regions culture by incorporating 
programs on politics, literature, art, music, and more.
Perhaps Latin America is most renowned by Ameri
cans for its distinctive music and dance, and the 
festival took advantage of this by presenting a num. 
ber of musical choices. Latin beats were pulsating in 
Rangos Hall over the weekend as it was transformed 
into a Latin Club complete with bands, DJs, and 
dancing. For those not familiar with the energetic
Latin dances, the 
Ballroom Dance 
club offered 
dance lessons to 
familiarize stu
dents with 
dances such as 
the merengue 
and salsa. Other 
Latin American 
performers sang and danced to the traditional and 
popular music of the area.
A number of unique events were held that pre
sented aspects of the culture not always considered 
by many. International wine tasting was a much 
talked-about event that offered students the chance 
to sample wines from South America. The event 
was only open to graduate students. An arts and 
crafts fair featured vendors selling a variety of 
hand-crafted products, while the food booths pro
vided authentic cuisine for those perusing the craft 
booths. A Spanish class was even offered to teach 
some of the basics of the language spoken in much 
of the region represented by the festival. Also, on 
Saturday, students had the opportunity to call 
anywhere in the world for free and to get in touch 
with family and friends abroad.
The festival may hold the most significance for 
those native to the countries of Latin America and 
the Caribbean, providing them the opportunity to 
share their pride in their homeland. These stu
dents got a reminder of home, and if it all caused 
some homesickness, the free international phone 
calls were available to lessen it. All those who 
chose to participate in any of the programs, they 
were rewarded with a greater appreciation for the 
culture of Latin America and the Caribbean.

Peruvian music plays
By TOM LIN
aVolVu MUuICo vlVtt9oIleo
As one contemplates Musuhailpa, two 
questions spring immediately to mind. 
First, how, do you pronounce it? Second, 
what is it? The second question may be 
the easier of the two to answer. 
Musuhailpa is a Peruvian musical group 
that uses Incan instruments to play folk 
songs from the Andean region of South 
America. The group played in Rangos 
Hall on Saturday as part of this years 
International Festival.
Scheduled to begin at 1 pm, 
Musuhailpa actually began playing at 
approximately 1:30 pm. The wait was 
well worth it. The band, made up of five 
people, played over 10 different instru
ments through the span of their perfor
mance. These ranged from guitars to 
flutes to drums. Perhaps the most inter
esting instrument, however, was a conch 
shell that was sounded periodically in 
one of the songs.
The music itself was generally rhyth
mic, fast, and catchy. Rare were the
songs that did not cause one to sway to 
the beat or tap ones toes. The sound 
was buoyed by two or three guitars, 
and the remaining group members 
cycled through various instruments, 
making Musuhallpas sound quite di
verse, yet always uniformly melodic. 
In addition to playing their instru
ments, almost all of the band mem
bers sang. Many different styles of 
Andean music were presented in the10 songs they performed.
The first to be played were perhaps 
the most innovative, in that wide 
ranges ofinstruments were used (such 
as the aforementioned conch shell) and 
the music varied greatly in tone and 
rhythm from what is commonly found 
in the industrialized world. Following 
the first few pieces, slower, more me
lodic songs were played. Although all 
the songs were relatively fast-paced, 
one could notice distinct differences in 
songs such as Ojos Azules and Se
ora Chichero. Following these songs 
came perhaps the high point of the 
presentation, several instrumental
at festival
pieces that focused primarily on guf, 
tar. The two band members who per. 
formed these pieces were particular]} 
impressive in the song Pajapill0* 
Though the two guitars moved along 
divergent courses, the instruments 
complemented each other through tfo 
entire song. After this was an inter* 
mission of sorts, as the band appar> 
ently rested or prepared for the next 
piece. In their place, a dance was per. 
formed to recorded music by masked 
people in traditional Peruvian garj?; 
Although this was interesting, it was 
undoubtedly the low-water mark ffy 
the presentation. The group wrapped 
up their presentation with a final songj 
which was characteristically fastpaced and harmonic.
If you missed Musuhailpa, you 
missed an entertaining performance 
with good music, catchy beats, and a 
conch shell. If they ever come by this 
way again, Id definitely recommend 
seeing them. Oh, by the way, 
Musuhailpa is pronounced, moo-zofrLAH-pah.
Andrew McDermott/ Tartan Managing Editor 
The costume parade highlighted different traditional outfits from 
various countries in Latin America and the Caribbean.
represented the beauty of the Flowers Festival in the Sevilleteros 
parade. This parade is celebrated every year in August. From the 
country of Chile, Pilar Jaime and Pat G. showed the HUeoV/ both 
a Chilean dance and a costume with a strong Spanish influence. 
This is evident in the elegant black outfit with its bolero jacket 
and lace trimming. In this particular dance, the woman use 
graceful movements and a handkerchief to flirt with the men.
The presentation concluded with a colorful finale that featured 
all of the participants in full 
costume accompanied of the 
Macarena.
The models led the audience 
in a lively practice of their newly 
learned dance.

f. The first time I heard They Might Be

{iwas disappointed. Many of the songs 
seemed forgettable, or worse, just plain 
fend. Ienjoyedthe variety ofhavingl8,19, 
ot-20 songs on their other albums, and the 
fr(tt that EVclCoO vrC9oCCp only has 13 
ti'acks contributed to the frustration.
New album release leaves room for improvement
Who: They Might Be Giants 
What: Factory Showroom 
Label: Elektra
There were too many rockin'  songs 
that guitarist/vocalist John Flansburg is 
fond of and not enough quirkiness that
the band has become known for. Lead 
vocalist John Linnell seemed to work 
extra hard on his pronunciation in the 
vocals, but I groped for the CD insert to 
look for the lyric sheet anyway. Discover
ing that they did not include lyrics (theres 
a first time for everything) I cursed them 
for selling out, for going mainstream, 
and swore that 2 would never listen to 
John & John again.
Then, I played it again. This time I 
picked up the singing saw in James K 
Polk. I checked their bboard 
_uelue91iVglipU1Icilp:w3 and found out 
who XTC and Adam Ant are. Someone 
told me to rewind past the beginning, and 
I found the quirkiness that I was looking 
for in the bonus track.
I played it again. The insert told me
that I Can Hear You was recorded with
out electricity. Your Own Worst Enemy, 
started to make sense as I realized that 
Full Bottle In Front of Me sounds an 
awful lot like Full frontal lobotomy. 
New York City still sounded pretty 
cheesy, but the bells are great and if 
you arent in love, itll make you wish 
you were.
I played it again and again. I thought 
Flansburgh sings like a girl, and How 
can I sing like a Girl became clear. I got 
the lyrics (via their web page rlln)f / 
999ilp:wicCp3 and suddenlyMetal De
tector was brilliant. Exquisite Dead Guy 
still doesnt make sense, but by this time 
it was so catchy I didnt care. After a few 
days of this behavior, I blew the dust off 
my other CDs and started playing them
again. But my mind still dwelled on EVc6
lCoO vrC9oCCpi
S-E-X-X-Y, the opening track, is a 
crowd pleaser and representative of the 
whole album. It shows that they can re
main true to their established fans, work 
with a full band (the song features violins, 
a viola, cello, guitars, trumpet, and key
board), and still progress  showing a 
jazzy, organic side. Til My Head Falls 
Off, for many longtime devotees, is an 
answer to the rumors of a possible 
breakup. While The Bells are Ringing 
wont quite make anyone forget MCru 
-euoOb1 The End of the Tour, it may 
remind you of an Edgar Allen Poe poem 
and is a great closer. The jewel of the 
album must be The Spiraling Shape. Its 
orchestration of guitars, drums, keyboard,
and a xylophone shows the benefits of an 
entire band and resembles the tone and 
wittier lyrics found in WIucCgu and EgCC7i
For all its flare, it is not an album 
without fault. Many songs run on too long 
and some refrains are repeated too much. 
While it features plenty of unusual in
struments, the accordian that they are 
well known for, is absent.
The Spiraling Shape plays too slow. 
Most severely, Linnells lyrics dont seeni 
as clever as in previous efforts; a draw-; 
back that stems from there just being 
fewer tracks.
Despite the flaws, I would recom-i 
mend EVclCoO vrC9oCCp to a friend* 
or a foe, and definitely to a fan. You 
might not like it at first, but remem-; 
ber, it woC91 on you.

Be it due to the growing number of new age shops 
throughout the city or the seeming impossibility of 
walking down any street without passing a flock of 
pathetic Maiylin Manson wanna-bes, its obvious 
tliat Pittsburgh is enteringa new dark Renaissance. 
Tke long-awaited and much-delayed new release by 
MACE, the citys biggest club band, stands to benefit 
greatly from this.
/^1 Who: MACE
fcagF What: Climax Generator
Label: Sharak Interactive Records
HgIpVY TeueoVlCo is a photograph of a band in 
transition. Perennially slagged for staying too close 
to the Nine Inch Nails not-quite-industrial-butstill-sample-heavy dance of (oellO -Vle 5VcrIue/ 
jtACE appears to be moving into harder-edged 
territory. True, some of the sound bytes remain the 
spine, but the pop is getting a bit more angry.
; Touting themselves as electro sex punk, you can 
probably guess from where they derive most of their 
lyrical inspiration. Of course lines like I wanna 
viatch you come (from Hunger) tend to be more 
laughable than seductive, but the live favorite Para
site truly shines with sleazy hushed vocals and the 
odd pom flick allusions. Even the blatant pop pieces 
(jSlave and Give it Up) are getting crisper and 
retain their danceability, confirming the bands de
sire to create fast-paced industrial dance, one of the 
hooks which makes their live shows a sea of sweaty, 
grinding bodies. Still, the stand-out is the re-titled 
Miss Masochist (formerly Sugar) which manages 
to be both lyrically mature and melodic without 
losing the apocalyptic breakdown fostered during 
the verse.
Drawbacks? Ever the perfectionists, MACE has 
included many reworkings of previously released 
material. Pull the Trigger, originally recorded on 
their 1994 debut vlCue7 Vu7 mVSe7/ undergoes its 
third and fourth incarnations (once as an acoustic 
bonus track). Also included are Gotta Believe It 
in the form of a folksy orchestral piece, and various 
tracks from last years rough-and-ready but no 
longer available HgIpVY TeueoVlCo cassette (differ
ent from the CD). While true, the new spin put on 
these as the result of a bigger budget are nice, but 
often you long for the energy and in-your-face 
quality of the original.
One thing Pittsburghers are thankful for is the 
diversity of the local talent. Low Sunday Ghost 
Machines dark shoe-gazing, The Gardens lush 
soundscapes, Carmillas Dress and their skeletal 
macabre breakdown, and Venus in Furs industrial 
performance art, among others make the gothic 
underbelly of the Steel City a contender with any 
scene in the nation. MACE are the big boys of 
the club circuit, and HgIpVY TeueoVlCo will be 
the CD setting the precedent over which the 
midnight floodwaters of the Pittsburgh under
ground will soon flow.Musicians play funky Polka

style. Neal Smith is his coand player of the soprano,
alto, and tenor saxophones. Player 
is an understatement, though. 
Neal actually blows fire out of the 
bells of his instruments and in
jures people who sit too close to the 
speakers. Joel Dick provides per
cussion for the group, and Barry 
Wolf rounds out the group with 
some foot-tappin lead accordion.
I found myself a little bored at 
first during the instrumentals on 
the album, but they grow on you. 
The songs with vocals, though, I 
liked immediately. Its not so much 
that Scotts lyrics are funny but 
rather the way that he sings them 
with a sort of resolve and deter
mination totally unbefitting the 
words. If I wasnt sure before, the 
lyrics convinced me that the band 
does not necessarily take itself 
seriously.

takes a stand on everything from 
Rush Limbaugh and plastic sur

vorite songs on the album is Hey! 
Lordy Mambo, a song that cries 
out to be sung along to. After magi
cally rhyming mambo with 
Rambo, wig wambo, and 
communicambo, the song goes 
into an extended drum solo by Joel 
Dick. Then, just about the time
when youre really getting into the 
rhythm, the song goes back to its 
first and only verse and ends. One 
fellow listener described it as, a 
great Spring Break song. Another 
song that cant be missed is the

is also rather interesting. In the 
song Talkshow, they use 
phrases like in the hood and 
Go Girl Go. Yet they still man
age to throw in some Yiddish and 
German like . kibosh and 
verboten in other songs. I know 
of no other band that can pull 
this off. Despite this, or perhaps 
because of it, are V:VgV1 could 
possibly be the next big genre of 
alternative music. Okay, maybe 
not, but their style could easily 
create a new following all of its

Old boys keep on rockin

Rush, the band spawned in the early 1970s as 
an answer to the Led Zeppelin craze, has contin
ued strong into the 90s with a record which 
mimics some of their shining moments.
Who: Rush 
What: Test for Echo 
Label: Atlantic Records
In Rushs latest album, ae1l tCo scrC/ lreO cVooO 
on the profoundly poetic lyrics, percussion, and 
electric bass which they have 
been known for in the past. In 
this latest installment, however,
Alex Lifeson, the guitarist and 
lyricist, adds a heavy virtuoso 
effect giving a new sonorous 
quality to their songs. Tracks 
such as Test for Echo, Time 
and Motion, arid VirtUality 
provide lyrics addressing con
cerns of the present day.
True Rush followers will no
tice the parallels between 
Lifesons guitar-work in this lat
est installment and that in pre
vious works such as -epI6
1nreoe1, RLLR/ and A EVoe9egg lC Iuw1i In these 
past installments, Lifesons superior guitarwork 
was realized through songs such as Xanadu, La 
Villa Strangiato, and YYZ. The bass and the 
guitar are not the only thing s that have changed 
in this new Rush installment. Geddy Lee, the lead 
singer, trades in the shrieking voice for which he 
had become known, for a more relaxed vocal sound 
that complements the newly established guitar 
qualities of the album.
The albums most original track is Test for 
Echo. Here Lifeson provides an ecclectic collec
tion of riffs that range from quick cuts of the, 
electric guitar to deep, long chords that are not' 
unlike'the sound of a tractor trailer. The regal andprofound effects of Rush are shown through thesong Time and Motion, which allows the listener 
to see Lees free flowing synthesizer abilities, which 
when coupled with Lifesons heavy guitarwork, 
provide for an energetic score. Lees quick interces
sions with the synthesizer are symbolic of time, 
and the punctual guitarwork of Lifeson provide an 
accurate portrayal of the time-motion phenom
enon.
The only disappointing feature of this new Rush 
release is Neil Pearts percussion work. With the. 
exceptionally original guitar and bass work one 
would expect a fresh percus
sion section to steal the show 
as well. Peart, however, lacks 
the flair that was present in 
his earlier works. In many 
ways, Peart simply comple
ments Lifesons guitarwork 
without actually experiment
ing as he did in albums such as 
,gg lre 'Cog7b1 , vlVwe and 
RLLRi In these previous install
ments, Peart provided a musi
cal evolution for the group 
through solos during songs like 
1996 Atlantic Recording YYZ and Tom Sawyer. The 
only songs which hint at 
Pearts previous panache are songs like Totem 
and Limbo, but are not nearly as pioneering as 
his earlier works.
Now, Lifeson edges Rush toward the heavy 
metal sound while still maintaining a nuance of 
the trance-like music patterns and the dramatic 
stop-time arrangements which remain a Rush-; 
trademark. Rushs new sound is shown through 
their track Half the World. Here, Rush hasnt 
corrupted its style and reformed to the carbon copy 
modern rockband, butinstead expanded the unique 
style for which they have become known.

Public Theater presents Cyrano

and Christian get in 
on a nefarious plan:

and Woods (Christian) as the 
handsome apple of Lautiers eye, 
this three-hour production is

The sets are expansive and re

, only scratched the surface of what 
f this play has to offer. There is 
daring. There is love. There are 
, jibes and jests that even Steve

strong lead performance by Crist

character, a fat man dressed as

for a full three hours. The pace

that this play is

Movie entertains despite flaws
By DAN GOLDWASSER
aVolVu vlVtt9oIleo
The best kind of stories are 
those based on fact. Assuming 
they stay true to the original 
story, and the story was inter
esting to begin with, these mov
ies can captivate an audience 
and even become blockbuster 
hits.
What: The Ghost and 
the Darkness 
Director:Stephen 
Hopkins 
Company: Paramount 
Pictures
One such movie, are TrC1l 
Vu7 lre zVoSue11/ is based on a 
true story. The year is 1898. 
The British are racing to build 
a railroad spanning the length 
of Africa. They call in John 
Patterson (Val Kilmer) to con
struct a bridge to cross a river. 
Things go well for a short while, 
and then a worker is attacked 
by a lion. Kilmer kills the lion 
and thinks all the danger is 
over. But it isnt. Soon, many 
of the workers are being at
tacked and killed by two lions, 
which they name The Ghost 
and The Darkness. Soon the 
problem begins to be too much, 
and famed hunter Charles 
Remington (Michael Douglas) 
is called in to help.
The film was overall enjoy
able. There was enough sus
pense to cause indigestion, and 
the action sequences (man vs. 
lion) were well done. But the 
writing falls a bit flat. This is 
surprising, considering the 
writer is two-time Oscar win
ner William Goldman (,gg are

Kilmer and Douglas manage to 
remain on top of the script. Those 
with sensitive stomachs might 
want to be wary of this film. 
There are some brutal lion at

complished through the clever 
mix of smart editing, Stan Win

computer graphics. But there is 
actually very little on-screen

Long-awaited Phish performance at Civic Arena leaves fans satisfied
: -By WINTER MASON
nVolVu HCnO 5VuVweo
^ ; Want to understand last Fridays Phish show at 
 t}ie Civic Arena? Lets go for a trip. A day before the 
 show  walk into Oakland and see a sudden inh crease in peddlers of hemp and bead jewelry. Talk to 
h one and learn of their experiences of the past month 
} following Phish in a Volkswagen bus with the back 
h seat ripped out. Everyone with a ticket in their hand 
h is filled with excitement.
} Friday comes finally, and hours before the concert 
' begins, the parking lot begins to fill. Fans mingle 
h around the stadium, anticipating the opening of the 
h doors at 6:30 pm, trying desperately to ignore the 
 slow, cold rain. Wander the lot, brothers and sisters 
; sit inside their vans with wares to selleverything
 from handmade dresses to beer to sandwiches to 
; glass pipes. Dreadlocks and flowing skirts are every; where. Closer to the stadium, people pace with one
finger pointing up from their head and a look of 
desperation on their face, trying to find that special 
someone with a spare ticket to sell. Someone some
where laughs and laughs and falls apart.
Doors open, and very slowly people p 
trickle inside. Some never make it in, rTQ 
having failed to purchase a ticket. The 
next hour is pure confusion, everybody c? 
trying to find their seat and failing. By the 
time the lights dim, it no longer matters, 
for everybody is bouncing around the room 
and seats have become little more than 
obstacles. Trey Anastasio cracks his first 
riff on the guitar and the crowd erupts as the 
band moves into Runaway Jim, and the music 
ran like an antelope after that. Mike Gordon, on 
bass, solos in Geulah Papyrus, with black light 
malting his pure neon green outfit glow as though he 
were a shining star. His incredible technical talent is 
played off of perfectly by the rest of the band as they
pick up on his solo and accompany in their own 
beautiful melange of funky jazz. They make their 
way through the first set in a never-ending cascade 
of colors and patterns that swim across the dome of 
the arena in harmony with the music coming from 
the stage. On comes Billy Breathes, from the 
album released last Tuesday, and Trey 
and Mike bounce on the tram
polines in perfect timing, turn
ing and twisting to the music. 
The set makes its way through 
Stash, Divided Sky, and fin
ishes off with Sample in a 
Jar.
During the break the hallways are 
cietura with patchouli-scented brothers and
sisters, eyes wide and pupils huge, searching for 
munchies and a drink. Some are still dancing to the 
music that just isnt there. When the music comes 
back, its Suzie Greenberg, the girl whos an artist
(but a genius, she is not). The songmelts into Maz^
 red lights shine on the crowd and the writhiife 
bodies make up the walls of the maze one nnift 
traverse to make it to the bathroom. Into the neKt 
song, Page McConnell on piano takes a solo anil 
shows his amazing skill. Not once does Jon Fishman 
(on drums) take a solo, but he still shows off when all 
members go off on their own, still somehow bringing 
it all together. The second set concludes with Harjy 
Hood, and the crowd cheers and cheers, lighted 
everywhere wave and dance and the stadium shak$ 
with stomping feet. The band jumps on with t 
encore of Julius, from -CI1l/ and then leaves 
quickly as they came, moving on to their next show.
The fans pick up what they lost  bags, shoes, 
minds  and very slowly make their way out of the 
stadium, many looking for a ride to the next show, 
many waiting until everybody else clears out to even 
attempt driving. Faces are shining with satisfactijjji 
in this show and anticipation for the next.

I Shot Andy Warhol
I did. I did it. It wasnt hard: Hes a wiry guy, but 
hes slow. Its all the meth and the heroin he did. So 
I got him right there in my sights  his big, white 
head right on the bead, and popped him. Damn, 
you should have seen him squeal. I shot him. Its 
crazy, sure, but he was asking for it, doing all those 
soup cans and Marilyns and pissing me off. He was 
a whiner, too, and he couldnt play a good round of 
golf to save his butt. He was Polish, too, I think, and 
Im Polish. Im not mad about that, exactly, but it 
ranked up there as one of the reasons. Otherwise, 
Im pretty excited about the whole thing, now.
Actually, this is about a young woman who goes 
a little funky and tries to shoot Warhol. Its been 
highly praised, so dont say I didnt warn you.

Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
OK, this one is cool. See, this really excitable 
actor (Gene Wilder) plays Willy Wonka. Theres 
this poor kid who goes around buying chocolate 
and then gets into trash-picking and then scores 
the Magic Ticket that lets him go on into Willy 
Wonkas magic factory, along with a bunch of other 
annoying kids who steal and whine. But the poor 
kid is the best of the bunch, and general zaniness 
ensues when he and his Grandfather bop around 
the factory until the end of the movie. Then there 
were also these Oompa-loompa guys who kind of 
j looked like this one kid I went to grade school with. 
That was pretty impressive.

and the fly become one. A real chiller, for all those 
who enjoy good movie-making.
Directed by David Cronenberg, the film won an

Man, by his very nature, is the free expression of

meals greatly reduces the risk of cavities.
Chewing sugar free gum is also a good idea, but 
none of that is of any consequence to fish, who have 
about as much interesting stuff to say as the

Biography promotes American Dream
By ANDRE M. ARCHIE
Special to the Tartan
Not since Zora Neale Hurstons cultural observations has the 
reading public witnessed the uniquely American earthiness as we 
find it displayed in Ken Hamblins first book, Pick a Better Country: 
An Unassuming Colored Guy Speaks His Mind About America. 
Perhaps the earthiness is quite fitting given the fact that Hamblin 
is anationally syndicatedjournalist and radio talk show host.
Most radio talk show listeners 
are plain spoken and a bit 
quirky.
Part biography, part social 
commentary, Pick a Better 
Country seeks to convince 
Americans  particularly, 
black and white Americans  
to take pride in the success 
and rewards brought about 
by pursing the American 
Dream. Specifically, Hamblin 
maintains that he is living 
proof that America works for 
blacks who work hard, and 
that white Americans no 
longer need to be miredin guilt 
about their countrys past. The 
circumstance Hamblin was 
bom into, but eventually over
comes, is weighted down by 
the Brooklyn neighborhood 
poverty of Bedford-Stuyvesant 
in the year 1940. Typical of 
most poor, first generation 
Americans, Hamblins parents 
were from the Caribbean is
land of Barbados. Hamblin 
was quite conscious of his 
familys lack of resources.
Given the fact that he was the 
eldest of five children, and 
without a father (his father 
left home early on in his life)
Hamblin was reminded of his
poverty daily as he traveled to the neighborhood grocery store with 
his mother. His mother would patiently wait until all of the custom
ers were gone before she pleaded with the store owner to allow her 
to have credit until she received her next welfare check. As Hamblin 
explains, the embarrassment he felt during these pleadings was 
nearly unbearable.
I remember loitering in Jacks grocery store, standing on that 
hard wood floor and feeling very insignificant. I would try to escape 
mentally by meticulously assessing my surroundings.
Implicit in this scenario we begin to see the emergence of a man 
who passionately grows to dislike handouts, and those who, unlike 
his family, unembarrassingly seek welfare asifitwere owed to them.
The brunt of Pick a Better Country is an apt critique of the black 
underclass, or black welfare culture, and how white liberals have 
provided the conduit for its page into the American mainstream. 
Hamblin is not unique in exploring these urgent issues. Thomas 
Sowell and William Julius Wilson have written extensively on the 
topic. The tone of Hamblins book is whats unique. For example, the 
title of some of the chapters are: Black Trash, Black Thugs, 
Brood Mares, Dark Town, Poverty Pimps, Quota Blacks, and 
the most interesting, Egg Sucking Dog Liberals.
With a motley of chapters such as these, two salient ideas can be 
distilled. The first is Hamblins attempt to help America better 
distinguish the minority within the minority in the black community 
that holds neighborhoods hostage, has no respect for authority, has 
high rates of illegitimacy, kills at will, and reduces urban areas to 
Third-World squalor. The burden of making the distinction, Hamblin 
maintains, should be eagerly assumed by the silent majority of hard
working, decent black Americans who most often feel the effects of 
crime as well as white backlash. (Taxis in New York City are 
reluctant to pick up black males in fear of being harmed. Most of the 
taxis, ironically, are driven by Asian and African immigrants.) But 
in most cases, hard-working black Americans are shamed into 
silence by blacks who are a part of the welfare culture when 
attempting to make the distinction, and by white liberals who subtly 
maintain that blacks at the bottom are some how more racially 
authentic.
Egg Sucking Dog Liberals is the most perceptive and humorous 
chapter of Hamblins book. Hamblin equates white liberals to a fat, 
lazy dog that sneaks around the henhouse sucking all the substance 
out of the freshly laid chicken eggs.... The metaphor is employed to 
illustrate the debilitating relationship between helping the black 
underclass and sucking out the energy and spirit of the underclass 
by exploiting its pathologies and fears. The refrain, Hamblin says, 
directed towards the black underclass is: blacks are hobbled because
America is racist. Hamblin is 
quick to point out that during 
the time of the civil rights 
movement, black Americans 
profited greatly from the likes 
of white liberals such as 
Michael Schwerner, Andrew 
Goodmen, and Viola Luizzo, 
but those days are over, and 
now its time for black Ameri
cans to assume control, _&s 
competitive equals, of their 
own destiny in America. I 
should point out that there is 
a segment within the black 
community who also exploit 
and build careers on the pa
thologies and fears of black 
welfare culture.
As a whole, Hamblins book 
is a pleasant and honest read. 
The gregariousness that 
comes through the pages is 
indicative ofthe many Ameri
cans, coast to coast, Hamblin 
converses with on a daily ba
sis. At the beginning of each 
chapter there are glimpses of 
the many conversations, 
through anecdotes of re
sponses and challenges to his 
radio show. Of course, not ev
eryone agrees with Hamblin, 
and certainly everyone will 
not enjoy his book, but what 
is certain is the fact that Pick 
a Better Country is a chal
lenge. Lest we forget the principles America stands for- principles 
that have brought millions of people to this country, principles that 
enabled a people once held in bondage to break free  we are 
rootless and doomed. For those who fail to take up the challenge 
by disregarding these principles,
Hamblin leaves his readers with another challenge: Pick a 
better country.
Embark with us on a 
project so secret... 
it has its own sauce.
Well, not really.
But we're making something cool. 
Honest.
