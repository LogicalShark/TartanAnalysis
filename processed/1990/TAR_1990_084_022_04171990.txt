University deliberates 
trimming shuttle route
Stephen Kang/Tartan Photographer 
A Carnegie Mellon student boards the shuttle. The elimination of 
several off-campus apartment buildings might cause the shuttles 
route to be cut in half next year.
By NICOLE BROCKMANN
Tartan Assistant News Editor
Students returning to campus 
next fall may find shuttle service to 
off-campus areas cut by nearly half 
because of the elimination of offcampus, University-managed 
apartments along Fifth Avenue, 
Director of Housing Tony Martin 
said last week.
According to Martin, when the 
shuttle service began eight years 
ago, its intent was to make the 
Oakland/Shadyside area more at
tractive to students by providing a 
way home which was both conven
ient and safe. Nearly every year 
since then, said Martin, the num
ber of University-managed build
ings has increased, and shuttle 
service has grown proportionately.
This year, however, is the first in 
which a radical change in the
Tm not sure that it's desirable to cut 
the shuttle route in half
 Anthony Martin, 
director of Housing
shuttle service has been proposed. 
If implemented, the new route 
would be one which more closely 
resembled the route which was used 
in the early years of the shuttle 
program.
The proposal to reduce shuttle 
service, or at least the amount of 
service paid for by the Housing 
Office, is prompted mainly by a 
desire to economize. One reason for 
this is that the cost of construction 
of the new dormitory is beginning 
to tax the Housing Offices funds. 
The new dormitory is also expected
to increase the number of students 
who choose to live on campus rather 
than in University-managed offcampus buildings.
Because the shuttle was set up 
as a Housing shuttle, the natural 
thingto do wouldbe to reduce shuttle 
service when you drop those build
ings from the housing system, said 
Dean of Student Affairs Michael 
Murphy.
Murphy said that if shuttle usage 
has outgrown the role it once played 
as a housing shuttle and, therefore,

Loan problems leave CMU unscathed
By RHONDA STRUMINGER
Tartan Staffwriter
A Pennsylvania student loan program 
that provides financial aid to 55,000 
students each year could collapse by 
June, according to legislators and offi
cials in Harrisburg. However, Carnegie
Mellon Associate Vice President for 
Financial Resources Walter Cathie says 
that this appears not to be a serious 
problem for CMU students.
According to officials of the Pennsyl
vania Higher Education Assistance 
Agency, Because of tighter restrictions 
on the federally subsidized loans, demand on the state program has bal
looned in recent years. This guaran
teed, non-subsidized loan for students 
offers an eight percent interest rate to be 
paid back during the school year.
Those Carnegie Mellon students who 
did not get financial aid last year were

Chatham postpones co-ed decision
By JOSH RUBEN
Tartan Contributing Editor
Citing insufficient data, the Chatham 
College Board ofTrustees has decided to 
postpone its decision on whether or not 
to make the 121-year old womens col
lege co-educational, according to 
Chatham President Rebecca Stafford. 
On February 13, Stafford announced
that the Trustees were considering the 
possibility of making the college a co
educational institution. The considera
tion was based upon data relating to the 
trend in single-sex education nation
wide. Demographics and polls of gradu
ating high school students illustrated 
that single-sex colleges would not be 
able to attract enough students to stay 
in business, according to Stafford and
Chathams Executive Director of Public 
Affairs, Jane Beckwith.
The final decision was to come at the 
Board ofTrustees April 22 meeting. But, 
said Stafford, the Trustees felt that the 
information which prompted their con
sideration of going co-ed was not conclu
sive enough to warrant a final decision. 
Therefore, an independent marketing

Mellons response to the recent rash 
of violent crimes around campus.
By MICHAEL J. EWEDOSH
Tartan News Editor
Two more Carnegie Mellon students were 
robbed at gunpoint last Monday, after a robbery 
and two kidnappings two weeks ago, bringing the 
total number of incidents of violent crime on or 
near campus to four.
Campus Police reported that the two men, who 
are roommates and live off-campus, were robbed; 
immediately after using an automated teller' 
machine at the Mellon Bank on the corner of ; 
Craig Street and Fifth Avenue.
A black male, 5 feet 7 inches tall, wearing a! 
Nike jacket, got out of a dark blue 1988 Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera and approached the victims.  
He asked them for matches or a lighter. They 
responded that they had neither, and began to 
leave.
After asking them not to leave three times, he 
approached them again and threatened them 
with a revolver, demanding that they give him all 
of their cash. They complied, after which the man 
got back into the car, which was occupied by two 
other men, and left the scene. The two students 
called Campus Police immediately after return
ing to their room.
Senate may 
fund rush
By NATHAN FULLERTON
Tartan Assistant Forum Editor
Dry Rush and other Greek/non-Greek activi- * . 
ties will be funded next semester if a proposal 
passed by Student Senates Funding and Recog- 1. 
nition Committee is passed by the full Senate : 
tonight. This funding would come to the Greeks 
by way of a special allocation made by Senate for 
Greek activities that are open to the entire cam- - 
pus.
The decision came after Senates F&R Commit-' 
tee denied CFP funded recognition status on the 
grounds that the organization is exclusionary.
According to Senate Rules Committee Chair 
Michael Witbrock, the decision was based on a  
clause in the Student Government Constitution 
which requires that any member of the student 
body must be granted membership in an organi- . 
zation if he or she requests it. Witbrock said that 
it was the determination of the Rules Committee 
that CFP did not comply with this requirement.
But a special committee formed by Student 
Senate Chair Chris Neighbor after a debate in 
last Tuesdays Senate meeting determined that, 
as recognized organizations, Greeks were eligible 
to receive funding in the form of special alloca
tions for events that are open to the entire cam
pus.
There is more flexibility in funding [with specontinued on page 3

Carnegie Mellon in Brief
University, Bosch announce 
management institute
Carnegie Mellon and the Bosch Corporation will announce on 
Thursday the formation of a $15 million partnership that will 
create a new institute to study international management.
The Bosch Corporation is an international manufacturing firm 
known for its automotive parts, consumer and capital goods, and 
communications technology. The company is headquartered in 
West Germany and has more than 100 plants worldwide, includ
ing 18 in the United States. In 1989, Boschs U.S. sales exceeded 
$1 billion.
The institute will be unique in that it will be the first business 
and academic partnership that aims to address business issues 
and concerns in a global economy.
 Carnegie Mellon President Richard M. Cyert will become direc
tor of the institute after his retirement on June 30.
Forbes Gallery to receive all 
proceeds of commissions
Proceeds from commissions taken at Forbes Gallery from the 
sale of student works will no longer go to the University, Student 
Senate Campus Affairs Chair Bill Lewis announced at last 
' Tuesdays Senate meeting.
A 20 percent commission is charged on works sold at the 
' gallery. Formerly, half of this fee went to the operation of the 
"gallery, while the other half was given to the University.
Lewis said that he spoke with administration officials, who 
agreed that the entire 20 percent commission should be given to 
the gallery and used for operation or maintenance of the Forbes 
Gallery.
Andrew to officially switch 
user interface to XWindows
After years of rumors, it has been officially announced that 
Andrew is switching user interfaces, from Window Manager to 
XWindows, effective next semester.
The move has been underway for quite a while. In the fall of 
1988, Vice President for Academic Services Bill Arms made the 
official statement, announcing the intent to pursue XI1 as the 
default windowing system. At the time of the announcement, 
most of the workstations on campus could not support XI1. By the 
fall of 1989, the workstations had been upgraded, and support 
and documentation had been made available to students.
Because Xll is a freely customizable system, Academic Com
puting will choose a basic XI1 environment for use by basic users, 
and will provide support for those interested in upgrading or 
modifying their systems.
Tartan sets up Collegiate 
Press Electronic Network
The Tartan has established a network for college newspapers 
to exchange stories and share information. The College Press 
Electronic Network, or CPEN, was developed by Tartan EditorIn-Chief Howdy Pierce and Tartan Contributing Editor and 
CPEN Administrator Dustin Frazier.
Pierce says that the network gives newspapers who participate 
' # perspective on events that they couldnt otherwise get without 
Allocating a large portion of their resources to that end. Its easy 
for The Tartan to cover the local, Carnegie Mellon angle, he 
.says, but its very difficult to get a story from someplace else.
'  Most issues that The Tartan deals with are college issues, he 
says. They are being dealt with by colleges and universities 
across the country. CPEN allows us to see different aspects of the 
problems as well as the way other universities deal with them. 
Frazier says that any college newspaper can request to become 
a CPEN member if it has the capability to send and receive 
\Jelectronic mail.
CPEN uses Carnegie Mellons Andrew system, according to 
Frazier. A newspaper making a submission would mail to a 
CPEN address on the Andrew system. From this alias, the 
message is referred to a distribution list which redirects the 
message to all member college newspapers. On average, a news
paper will receive the article three hours after it is submitted.
Among other college newspapers who have joined the network 
are The Brown Daily Herald, of Brown University in Providence, 
Rhode Island; The Technique, of Georgia Tech University in 
Atlanta, Georgia; the Imprint of the University of Waterloo, in 
Waterloo, Ontario; the Daily Illini, of the University of Illinois, 
in Champaign, Illinois; and New speak, of the Worcester Poly
technic Institute, in Worcester, Massachusetts.
University appoints new 
Modern Languages director
Barbara Freed, vice dean for language instruction at the 
University of Pennsylvania, has been appointed professor of 
modern languages and director of the program in modern lanfuages at Carnegie Mellon.
A nationally-known language educator, Freed will succeed 
; Juris Silenieks on July 1. Silenieks, who joined the Carnegie 
Mellon faculty in 1960, plans to retire.
Students may view debate 
remotely at WQED studios
Students may remotely view the Natural Gas Debate live by 
satellite at the WQED-TV studios while it occurs at the Univer
sity of Oklahoma on Thursday from 2:30 to 5 pm.
Debated topics will include the substitution of natural gas for 
imported oil and its future in electricity generation and as an 
automobile fuel.
The national TV conference is the first of an 11 part series 
concerning man, energy, and the environment. It is sponsored by 
the Jefferson Energy Foundation, a non-profit foundation con
cerned with educating people about energy issues. Carnegie 
Mellon will host the last debate in June 1991, entitled National 
Energy Policy and Global Environmental Adaptation.
WORLD NEWS
U.S. refuses to 
link Israelis to 
Iraqi proposal
WASHINGTON (AP)  The 
State Department said it wel
comes an offer by Iraq to destroy 
chemical weapons, but does not 
believe the destruction should be 
part of a deal under which Israel 
would destroy its chemical and 
nuclear arms.
We have made clear that we 
oppose linking the elimination of 
chemical weapons systems to 
other issues or weapons systems, 
said Richard Boucher, a State 
Department spokesman.
That said, we would of course 
welcome any offer to destroy 
chemical weapons, he added.
Sen. James A. McClure, RIdaho, said that during conversa
tions in the Iraqi city of Mosul, 
Iraqs president, Saddam 
Hussein, repeated an offer to 
destroy his arsenal of chemical 
and other non-conventional weap
ons if Israel agrees to eliminate 
chemical and nuclear weapons.
Soviets admit to 
WWII Katyn 
Forest massacre
MOSCOW (AP)  The Soviet 
Union admitted for the first time 
that its secret police murdered
15,000 Polish officers in the Ka
tyn Forest during World War II, 
in what it called one of the most 
horrifying Stalinist crimes.
The Tass news agency issued 
an official statement as Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev 
met with Polish President 
Wojciech Jaruzelski.
Western historians concluded
years ago that the Soviets were 
responsible for killing the captive 
officers, most of whom were shot 
in the back of the head, but 
Moscows refusal to admit it was 
a barrier to better Soviet-Polish 
relations. Jaruzelski was sched
uled to visit Katyn last Saturday.
Until the announcement, the 
Soviet Union had blamed Nazi 
Germany for the massacre.
The Katyn Forest, located near 
Smolensk, southwest of Moscow, 
was captured by Germany during 
World War II, and later recap
tured by Soviet soldiers.
While the Nazis invaded Po
land from the west in 1939 to 
start World War II, the Soviets 
invaded from the east. Germany 
and the Soviet Union had signed 
a non-aggression pact that as
signed them spheres of influence 
in Eastern Europe.
West Germans 
fear unification 
will spur terrorists
WEST BERLIN (AP)  West 
German officials are bracing for a 
resurgence of leftist terrorism and 
right-wing extremism as a result 
of the coming unification with the 
East, published reports said last 
week.
Meanwhile, Foreign Minster 
Hans-Dietrich Genscher in Bonn 
said he wants to meet soon with 
his new East German counter
part, to prepare for unification 
talks involving the U.S. and the 
Soviet Union.
East German Prime Minister 
Lothar de Maiziere spent his first 
full day in office, after telling tele
vision interviewers the pace of 
unification may be slower than 
that predicted by Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl.
Cabinet ministers from both
sides were preparingtalks as early 
as this week to meet the goal of a 
monetary, social, and economic 
union by July 1. Those steps alone 
would take both states well on the 
way to unification.
Since the two nations began 
coming closer last November, 
there have been growing concerns 
that both the far left and the far 
right would try to take advantage 
of the changes.
In an interview with Bonn 
newspaper Die Welt, the head of 
West Germanys criminal inves
tigations office said the leftist Red 
Army Faction terror gang views' 
the unification process as a wide 
open field.
So it is conceivable that the 
progress in unification also pres
ents a potential danger, Die Welt 
quoted Hans-Ludwig Zachert as 
saying. The need to get into the 
headlines could encourage the Red 
Army Faction to view the current 
time as ripe for attacks.
Zachert said his office, the 
Bundeskriminalamt, had already 
been in contact with its counter
parts in East Germany.
Gorbachev steps 
up pressure on 
Lithuanian leaders
MOSCOW (AP)Soviet Presi
dent Mikhail S. Gorbachevs let
ter to the Lithuanian government, 
also signed by Prime Minister 
Nikolai Ryzhkov, said the Lithu
anian situation tightens into an 
ever-tighter knot, assuming the 
nature of a political dead end.
The letter mentioned as anticonstitutional actions the Lithu
anian legislatures decision to halt 
spring conscription into the So
viet army; attempts by the Lithu
anian authorities to seize prop
erty of the Communist Party of
the Soviet Union, and an April'S 
law that establishes identity cards 
for Lithuanians that discrimi
nates against Soviet citizens in 
the republic.
The letter said Lithuanians 
Parliament should restore the 
republics position to that of Marph,' 
10, 1990, the day before inde
pendence was declared.
Chinese leader to 
visit Soviet Unionr 
sign agreement
BEIJING (AP)  Premier U 
Peng will visit the Soviet Union 
April 23-26, becoming the first 
Chinese head of government to 
travel to Moscow since 1964, the 
Foreign Ministry said last week.
The ministry said in a state
ment that Li will have an exten
sive and in-depth exchange of 
views with Soviet leaders on the 
bilateral relations and major in
ternational issues of common 
concern.
Li was invited to visit the So
viet Union last May, when Soviet 
President Mikhail Gorbachev 
made the first trip to Beijing by a 
Soviet leader in three decades. 
Pro-democracy activists in China 
used the visit to promote their de
mands for reforms, but the move
ment was crushed in June. -
Chinas leaders have sinGe 
taken a hard-line Communist 
approach, ignoring Moscows re
form program.
The exchange of visits has 
marked the end of decades of 
hostility between the two social1 i 
ist states.
Soviet sources said it is likely 
the two leaders will sign an agree
ment to promote bilateral trade 
and an accord to easing military 
tensions along the 4,300-mile, 
shared border.

Boeing signs 
agreement to 
develop 767-X
SEATTLE (DJ)  Boeing Co.s 
Boeing Commercial Airplane 
Group said it signed a memoran
dum of understanding with three 
Japanese aerospace companies 
that could lead to a cooperative 
effort to build the proposed Boe
ing 767-X wide-body twinjet.
Under terms of the memoran
dum, Mitsubishi Heavy Indus
tries, Kawasaki Heavylndustri.es, 
and Fuji Heavy Industries to
gether would share responsibil
ity for providing Boeing with 
between 15 and 20 percent of the 
airframe, Boeing said.
Boeing said it expects that the 
three firms would continue to 
build the same category of items 
they currently provide for the 767- 
200 and -300 models, plus some 
additional airframe structure to 
be determined in the near future. 
Items they currently supply in
clude fuselage panels and aero
dynamic fairings.
Boeing reported in December 
that it is offering the 767-X to 
prospective customers. The com
pany said that if sufficient orders 
are received, it would launch the 
aircraft into production and des
ignate it as the Boeing 777. The 
targeted time period for initial 
deliveries is the first half of1995, 
the company said.
Bill to tighten air 
pollution laws 
passes Senate
NEW YORK (DJ)  Under the 
clean-air bill that the Senate 
passed last week, getting permits 
to operate would be a big hurdle 
for companies that emit regulated 
substances. If the House Energy
and Commerce Committee adopts 
an amendment backed by Rep. 
Rick Boucher (D.-Va.), requiring 
states to give small firms extra 
time to comply with the rules, 
Rep. Ron Wyden (D.-Ore.) will 
propose to temporarily delay steep 
fines if a small company acciden
tally emits a prohibited substance 
as it is trying to comply. His meas
ure also is expected to seek re
moval of criminal penalties for 
paper-work violations.
Without such safeguards, per
mit requirements could become 
the small-business controversy of 
1990, predicts Theresa Pugh, the 
National Association of Manufac
turers director of environmental 
policy. The trade group contends 
that it probably would cost small 
firms more to analyze their chemi
cal emissions when seeking a 
permit than to clean them up. It 
urges that small enterprises be 
allowed to submit estimates. 
Printers and others that produce 
batches of different products 
would face repeated hassles if 
required to get a permit for each 
product.
The amendment for added time 
to meet permit rules remains 
subject to review by the House 
panel; the Senate rejected a simi
lar provision.
Proposal to limit 
debt may spark 
debate on budget
WASHINGTON (DJ)  Presi
dent Bushs budget director, Rich
ard Darman, said that a bill to 
raise the governments borrow
ing power  likely to be needed 
later this year  could become 
the battleground for proposals to 
streamline the federal budget, 
including reform of credit pro
grams.
I think its quite likely, Dar
man said last week. I think youre
going to see the debt limit being 
used to force action intended to be 
fiscally responsible.
Last fall, Senate supporters of 
budget reform failed-in a floor 
battle to tack to the debt-limit bill 
a measure that would have taken 
the Social Security trust fund sur
plus out of the deficit calculation.
Darman, in comments before 
the House Task Force on Urgent 
Fiscal Matters and to reporters 
later, said the must-pass debt 
limit bill is again seen as the best 
legislative vehicle to advance such 
proposals.
Its true that the debt limit 
hasnt been much of a restraint 
against deficit spending, he said. 
But were beginning to see it as a 
way to force control of spending.
Darman said the political cli
mate is right this year for reform 
of the federal credit programs. 
Including direct loans, loan guar
antees, insurance commitments, 
and government-sponsored enter
prises, the programs had a $6 
trillion liability at the end of1989.
The administration proposes 
more accurate accounting of the 
programs as well as limits on the 
overall government exposure.
While there has been biparti
san sentiment that the programs 
should be reformed, technical 
differences on how the reforms 
should be implemented have 
stalled, efforts. Darman said the 
administration is ready to bar
gain.
We should all give a little, settle 
those issues, and get moving, he 
said.
Feds move to

manufacturer
LOS ANGELES (DJ)  The 
Northrop Corporations legal 
problems mounted as the Justice 
Department indicated it would
help litigate a whistle-blower^ 
suit alleging that the company 
overbilled the Navy on the F-A-18;' 
strike fighter.
The governments intervention 
in the matter, unsealed in federal 
court here, is a big lift for Eldon 
Janssen, the former Northrop 
employee who brought the ci 
action in 1987.
ANorthrop spokesman declined 
to comment, saying the company' 
hadnt yet reviewed the court fil
ing. The aerospace concerns out
side counsel, Joe Coyne, woul< 
say only that he was confident oi 
prevailing.
Janssen was a manager of conf 
tracts and pricing at the division 
where Northrop builds the centef 
and aft fuselage sections of the Fr 
A-l 8 for prime contractor McDon-j 
nell Douglas Corp. He was laid off[ 
by the company in 1987. That 
wasnt long after he first com
plained to superiors about| 
Northrops billing practices, ac^ 
cording to Janssens lawyer.
In joining the suit, the govern

that generally adopted Janssens 
central allegation that in 1985 
Northrop developed but failed to. 
disclose a cost-saving manufact

to the government from 198^;

Fraternities consider escort program
By MICHAEL J. EWEDOSH
, Tartan News Editor' u
''In an attempt to increase personal 
i'dfety on and near campus, the Council 
of Fraternity Presidents will discuss the 
possibility of involving the fraternity 
. system with a walking escort service at 
the CFP meeting to be held April 26. The 
service would be tailored to meet the 
needs of students who dont take advan
tage of the Universitys Escort van serv
ice.
CFPPresidentJohnGinsburgsaidthat 
tfie idea of a walking escort service is still 
at the preliminary discussion stage, but 
he indicated that he thought the idea 
might work because of the late hours 
kept by fraternity members.
" Carnegie Mellon Police Chief James 
E&Paglia supports the program. Being 
With someone else makes it much less 
likely that a person will be a victim of a 
crime, he said.
Its got merit, said Dean of Student 
Sffairs Michael Murphy, explainingthat 
; walking escort services are in place at a 
ntimber of schools nationwide.
 One scenario for the walking escort 
service that Murphy envisioned is based 
ori escort teams of two people. This sce

Canadian university creates walking escort service
By PAUL DONE
Imprint Editor-In-Chief,
STACEY LUBIN,
& JONATHAN YUEN
Imprint Staffwriters
WATERLOO, Ontario (CPEN)The University of 
Waterloo has recently created a student escort serv
ice similar to one that is being discussed at Carnegie 
Mellon to help reduce occurrences of sexual assault on 
campus.
The University of Waterloo Student Escort Team, 
sponsored by the Federation of Students, is a service 
for people who feel uncomfortable walking alone on 
campus after dark. Kim Speers, vice president for 
University Affairs, organized the service while she 
was safety commissioner for the Womens Issues
Board.
I noticed in the files that there were various at
tempts to initiate a volunteer walk home program, 
said Speers, but for a variety of reasons, this type of 
service could not get off the ground. A walk home is 
needed because people are afraid to walk alone on 
campus during the evening hours. Everyone should 
be able to do this and the University Student Escort 
Team guarantees this right.
The service, like similar ones at other Canadian 
universities such as York, Guelph, and the Univerisity of Western Ontario, provides a foot patrol for the 
whole campus, but the main focus is to escort stu
dents, faculty, and staff. A pair of student security 
employees, who are in radio contact with the dis
patcher, will meet the individual and walk him or her 
to a safe location on campus within the boundaries
defined by the the service.
The hiring procedure for the student escorts is 
thorough and exacting. The applicants undergo a 
background check and two separate interviews.
The results are already positive. There are many 
calls. comirTg in and they are walking people home

Ontario Work Study Program, the service is 75 per
cent funded by the provincial government.

could be combined with the Escort vans 
dispatch, which currently operates out 
of both Skibo and the Campus Police 
dispatch center.
The dispatcher would then send two 
escort volunteers to walk the person to 
his or her destination and then return to 
the dispatch center. Theres safety in 
numbers, Murphy said. If escorts work 
in pairs, youre insuring that youre not 
forcing someone else to walk' alone  
that would defeat the point of the whole 
system.
But the program, if created, would
have to address certain security con
cerns. There are security concerns, like 
training and reliable availability, said 
Murphy.
Some screening mechanism and se
lection process would work with rules 
and guidelines for any program thats 
established to insure the safety of the 
systems users, Murphy said.
Murphy thinks that screening and se
lection will be sufficient to address con
cerns that the escorts themselves might 
harm the users.
Ginsburg said that the idea for a walking escort came out of a meeting of the 
Enrollment Group Student Advisory 
Committee last Tuesday, when Vice 
President for Enrollment William Elli
ott expressed concern over the recent 
rash of violent crimes in the campus 
area.
The walking escort idea is just one idea 
that CFP could consider, said Ginsburg. 
Another possibility that the group will 
discuss involves fraternity participation 
in a campus watch program that would 
be styled after neighborhood watch 
groups.
We need to assess what the demand 
for the current Escort service is, said 
Murphy, and then address the question, 
of how many people  among both those 
who use the existing system and those 
who do not  would use a walking sys
tem.
If any measure is implemented 
Ginsburg said that it probably will not be 
in place before next semester, and then 
would be implemented with careful con
sideration by the fraternities as well as 
consultation with Campus Police and 
Student Affairs.

After two weeks plagued by a rash 
of violent acts committed against 
Carnegie Mellon students, the Uni
versity has taken steps to reduce 
the instances of violent crime on 
and near campus.
Investigations into the four inci
dents that have occurred in the past 
two weeks are being conducted by 
Pittsburgh Police, according to Car
negie Mellon Police Chief James 
LaPaglia. He said that police have 
leads which they are investigating, 
but he could not comment on them 
at this stage in the investigation.
Citing the unusual and steep in
crease in violent acts against stu
dents, LaPaglia said that night 
patrols of the area surrounding the 
campus have been increased. In 
the past there was one car tha^t was 
assigned to patrol off-campus areas, 
concentrating on those areas where 
the University has off-campus hous
ing, he said. Now we have dedi
cated an additional patrol unit to 
those areas in an attempt to step up
security.
The additional unit brings the 
number of police patrols of the cam
pus to five: one unit assigned to the 
southern part of campus, another 
assigned to the northern part, two 
vehicles patrolling areas surround
ing the campus and off-campus 
housing, and a sergeants vehicle 
that roams the entire area. Because 
the new off-campus patrol unit has 
been addednot merely reassigned 
 the new system will not result in 
a decrease of security on campus.
LaPaglia said that units in offcampus areas are also monitoring 
areas where students walk. If wq 
see a student walking while were or| 
patrol, he said, well stop and offei) 
them a ride. i !
In addition to the increased pa-! 
trols, Campus Police, working wi'tK 
with the Office of International 
Education and the Division of Stu-; 
dent Affairs, was scheduled to hold a 
personal safety seminar yesterday 
afternoon in Doherty Hall 2210. !
The goal was to increase aware-i 
ness of personal safety issues both 
on and off campus.

MIT Physics professor emeritus Philip Morrison spoke with his wife about the benefits of teaching science 
as a set of tools that students use to enhance their understanding and develop additional questions.
MIT prof 
lectures on 
science
education
By BIDISHA MUKHERJEE
Tartan Staffwriter
As featured guests of the Presidents Distin
guished Lecture Series, Philip Morrison, Profes
sor of Physics Emeritus of MIT, visited Carnegie 
Mellon with his wife, Phyllis, to discuss different 
approaches to science education. The pair spoke 
of education in terms of curiosity and extrapola
tion. The Morrisons explained that science 
education must be more inquisitive and that 
teachers at all levels need to observe as children 
do. In essence, instructors must find a way to 
teach science by incorporating the scientific 
method, the tools of equations and formulas, and 
speculation in order to learn more about the 
world.
The Morrisons began their lecture with an 
overhead of a set of footprints thought to be 
nearly 3.2 million years old. What can you learn 
about these prints? was the question that the 
Morrisons posed.
The pictures were of three sets of human-like 
footprints found at an African archaeological 
site called the Old Divide. The Morrisons pro
ceeded to show that these footprints were merely 
a snapshot of a few seconds of the life of a 
primitive family during a volcanic explosion. 
They proved this by first imagining that the two 
larger sets of prints were made by adults and 
that the smaller set belonged to a child.
The main point that the Morrisons empha
sized throughout their inquiry was that stu
dents and teachers must be open to learning a 
variety of scientific disciplines rather than ex
ploring only one aspect in depth.
By employing concrete formulas of paleontol
ogy, biomechanics, and medicine, they were able 
to determine the approximate heights of the 
primitive people and the speed at which they 
were walking at the time the explosion occurred. 
By analyzing the sediment and the layers of ash, 
they were also able to determine that the family 
was walking about in the spring, the ground was

research group and consultant will be contracted 
to study the future of single-sex education as it 
pertains specifically to Chatham.
The researchers will work with the Admini
stration and Marketing task forces set up by the 
Trustees. The final report will be presented in 
time for the Trustees to make their decision at 
their October meeting.
Going co-ed, said Stafford, is only being con
sidered as a means of expanding and broadening 
the school based on an overall plan. The Trus
tees wanted to plan an academically sound lib
eral arts college with 800 students and 500 resi
dents, said Stafford. Chatham currently has an 
overall enrollment of around 700.
moist, and there was newly fallen ash. By employ
ing the techniques and laws of mathematics, the 
Morrisons were able to extrapolate information 
that encompassed a wide range of scientific disci
plines.
The Morrisons emphasized the need for educa
tors to abandon the funnel idea of science educa
tion. Rather than try to fill each student with as 
much information as possible, they suggest that 
students return to the basic ideas of inquiry and 
their own love of science. They suggested that
Stafford was also quick to point out that going 
co-ed is not the only option the Trustees are con
sidering. The research will investigate the feasi
bility of attracting the desired numbers of stu
dents to both a single-sex and a co-ed college, said 
Stafford.
The February 13 announcement was met with 
harsh criticism from students, faculty, and alumni. 
Protests, letter-writing campaigns, and vigils 
electrified Chatham and focused the attention of 
the city on the small, picturesque campus.
Because they felt at the time that the Trustees 
were making a hasty decision, the students organ
ized committees to research other options for the 
school and. the feasibility of expanding while 
remaining a single-sex college.
educators teach laws and formulas as tools in 
gaining a better understanding of a scientific prob
lem and the generator of further questioning.
Philip Morrison earned his bachelors degree in 
physics from CIT in 1936. He went on to complete 
his PhD at the University of California at Berkeley 
under Dr. Robert Oppenheimer and to participate 
on the well-known Manhattan Project. Currently, 
the Morrisons reside in Boston, where they con
tinue to fulfill their scientific curiosity through ex
tensive reading and research.
Student Government President Mellissia Diggs 
said that the entire student government board was 
very pleased with the decision. I think the Trus
tees felt the pressure of the alumni, students, and 
faculty.
Diggs explained that there was a great deal of 
outrage on the part of the students, alumni, and 
faculty because they were not being included in the 
Trustees decision-making process. Members from 
these groups will now sit on the task forces, accord
ing to Diggs.
I will make sure, said Diggs, that there are 
students who will be in Pittsburgh [over the sum
mer] who will be involved. She added that such 
students will be the more outspoken advocates of 
single-sex education.
Art officials say 
model cutbacks 
are temporary
By DANIEL DE GRANDPRE
Tartan Staffwriter
Officials of the Art Department have denied the rumb 
that the use of live models for students in figure drawing 
classes is being permanently scrapped due to lack of 
funds.
Brian Rodgers, head of the Art Department, said Iasi 
Friday that some cutbacks were made this semester, bjit 
that those cutbacks were acceptable because only thrfce 
weeks were left in the semester. I dont know wheje 
anybody got this rumor, said Rodgers, but its corii 
pletely false. !
Herbert Olds, an art professor, added that all of tin e 
essential models used by the Art Department were still 
on the departments payroll. The department has also 
kept those professional models who have a great deal of 
experience to make sure that they are available next 
year.
The Art Department, said Olds, will hire back tfce 
usual number of models next semester.
Loan problems

mailed information pertaining to this loan, run by tl>< 
Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency. 0(i 
of the 4,100 Carnegie Mellon students eligible to receivt 
the loan, 112 students took advantage, of the offer  '/I 
undergraduate and 41 graduate students.
Cathie believes that the loan, if discontinued, will not 
significantly hurt students financially and that thos; 
presently attending the University with the loan shouk 
have no trouble paying for school without it next year.
Cathie explains that the program offered a good deal 
for families that earn too much to qualify for othej 
Federal loans.
According to a PHEAA statement, the continuation o 
the agencys eight percent student loan program for th< 
1990-91 academic year is contingent upon the agency 
ability to obtain future tax-exempt funding to financ' 
the program. Financing completed as of March 29 wjl 
keep the program in place to cover the loans to appl i 
cants currently approved on the system if their loai 
term begins before April 16.
PHEAA in the meantime has stopped processing al! 
applications.
The non-subsidized loan program was established ji 
1983 and is the only one of its kind in the nation. Wt 
dont have the $10 million, we need another $100 milliiji 
credit enhancement and we dont have the credit rates j1 
our favor, said PHEAA Director Kenneth Reeher. Th{> 
isnt bright. !
Senator Ralph Hess (R-York), who heads PHEAA' 
board of directors, also stressed that the outlook is no 
bright. According to an article in The Pittsburgh Presis, 
in November of 1989 PHEAA was forced to hold 
checks to about 16,000 students scheduled to receive 
non-subsidized loans. The agency resumed payments i i 
January after selling older loans and making other 
financial moves. According to Hess, Debt owed to tfre 
non-subsidized program would not be affected if tHi 
program loses its ability to issue new loans.

Some people thought that cabins

somewhat luxurious for a student 
retreat. Dean Witchner pointed 
j out that the money to pay for the 
retreat came from the Travel 
Budget, which comes from the

Activities Fee Account. A figure 
of approximately $2000 was sugt gested while the Senate retreat

what that route would be has yet 
been made.
Martin also suggested a pos
sible proposal in which the shuttle 
service would continue to operate 
on its present scale, but due to the 
fact that only half of the route 
would include University hous
ing, the Housing Office would pay 
for only half of the cost.
Heres an area where Housing 
could pay less for services hous
ing needs less of, he said. The re
mainder of the cost of operating 
the shuttle could come from the 
Security Office, which currently 
provides the money for Escort and 
operates both services.
Carnegie Mellon Police Chief 
James LaPaglia sees that option 
as a possibility. The money all 
comes from the same source any
way, he said. Its all comingfrom 
the University.
However, even if the shuttle 
service would continue at its pres
ent level of operation, there is no 
guarantee that it would continue 
to serve its present locations.
I dont know if theres any logic 
in keeping the exact same route 
just because we had residents 
living there last year, said Mar
tin. He felt that a better alterna
tive might be to devise a new 
shuttle route for next year based

At 3:32 am, officers responded to 
a report of a fight in progress at

group of people on Theta Xis patio 
pushing and shoving each other. 
A member of Theta Xi told the 
officer that as he attempted to 
clear the Theta Xi patio of per

party, a person grabbed the gold 
chain around his neck, pulled him 
out of the doorway, and struck

The Vending Fund was dis
cussed. Dean Witchner explained 
that the money comes from the 
video arcades and goes to Student 
Affairs. The first $7000 goes to 
conferences, and since no one went 
to the conferences, the AB Ex 
Comm was taken on a retreat. 
The rest of the money goes to 
Student Affairs.
The possibility of extending the 
shuttle route to Squirrel Hill was 
also discussed. Dean Murphy 
suggested that Senate form a 
committee immediately to look 
into the matter. The shuttle is 
owned by Housing and run by 
Security. This needs to be looked 
into ASAP since Housing will 
probably be changing the route 
next year as they are losing some 
off-campus spaces. It was pointed 
out that some people are signing 
leases assuming that the shuttle 
route will remain the same. With 
the recent increase in crime, both 
city and CMU Security have in
creased their efforts in the apart
ment areas. CFP has considered 
the possibility of having a walk
ing escort service.
President  Mark Mittelhauser: Architects from Dennis

the odor, and they complained of 
minor nasal and throat irritation 
and an unpleasant taste in their 
mouths as a result of inhaling the 
fumes. The officers left the area to 
protect themselves from any fur
ther health hazards and the occu
pants of the seventh floor were 
evacuated. One officer required 
transportation to Presbyterian 
University Hospital for treatment 
of slight chest pains and other 
symptoms, and he was later re
leased in good condition. The 
Pittsburgh Bureau of Fires was 
notified of the situation, and fire 
units, including an EMS hazard

The source of the odor could not 
be determined and the area was

money from works sold from 
Forbes Gallery, Campus Affairs 
found out that CMU does not 
receive any percentage, and the 
Gallery receives 20 percent. 
Campus Affairs will also be look
ing into the Smoking Areas as 
well as the postering problems 
with outside organizations.
Funding and Recognition 
Nicole Brockmann: The full 
budget meeting is April 24. CFP 
requested funded recognition. 
F&R denied it since the Senate 
Constitution states that exclusive 
organizations cannot be funded. 
Ginsburg thought that it was not 
a good idea to fight this matter 
since there are ways to get around 
the clause. Some people saw the 
fact that they wouldnt immedi
ately be allowed to work on an in
dependent organizations buggy 
as exclusionary. Article 13.2 of 
the Constitution states that fra
ternities and sororities may dis
criminate on the basis of sex. It 
was also pointed out that all 
groups on campus have a certain 
bend. If this developed into exclu
sion, then there is a problem. How
ever, anyone can and should be 
able to join any campus groups. 
Brockmann also pointed out that 
Greeks are still eligible for fundingthrough special allocations for 
non-exclusionary, Greek/nonGreek events. Funding CFP 
seemed to be more of a problem to
money goes, he said.
A concern is rising, however, 
that many students who want to 
live off campus have chosen their 
living places based partially on 
their closeness to the shuttle 
route. Now many of those places 
may no longer be near the shuttle 
route.
There is some indication that 
that may be happening.... Quite a 
few people do that, said LaPaglia.
Clearly, there are a lot of stu
dents who have selected places 
which in their own minds might 
be on the shuttle route, said 
Martin.
According to LaPaglia, the 
combined Shuttle/Escort service 
this year was budgeted at $58,600. 
The total number of riders ex
pected to use the shuttle/escort 
service by the end of this aca
demic year is 190,000, up from
60,000 just five years ago.
Murphy said that the incre
mental cost of operating the 
shuttle on its current route may 
not be much greater than operat
ing only in areas where there is 
University housing.
He says that there are advan
tages and disadvantages to cut
ting the route. If its cut, he 
says, it might be the case that 
three instead of two shuttle runs 
can be made each hour.
Questions about the shuttles 
route come a year after the Uni
versity opted not to expand shuttle 
service to the Squirrel Hill area.
Murphy, who was student 
ombudsman at the time, said that 
the Business Affairs Student 
Advisory Committee as well as 
the administration determined 
that the costs involved with a 
Squirrel Hill route  nearly 
$50,000 without the purchase of a 
third $35,000 shuttle  made 
such a move impractical.
Instead, he said, the University
opted to expand the Escort serv
ice to a 24 hour service at a cost of 
$20,000.
Murphy said that other factors 
came into play in the decision on 
the Squirrel Hill route. Since the 
issue of a user fee came up with 
regard to a Squirrel Hill route, he 
said, the convenience of Port 
Authority buses which run up and 
down Forbes during the day, 
combined with 24 hour Escort 
service, helped the group to rule 
out a Squirrel Hill shuttle.
But since then, Port Authority 
Transit has eliminated student 
U-tickets, which allowed students 
to ride at a discount. Murphy said 
that this, with other factors, might 
induce the University into re
examining the possibility of a 
Squirrel Hill route. Im not sure 
we could compete on a cost or 
convenience basis, though, he 
said.
Murphy said that the situation 
is different in the Shadyside ar
eas that would be affected by a 
cutback. Buses dont run nearly 
as often on Forbes, nor does Fifth 
Avenue run through the center. of 
Shadyside, he said, contrasting 
it to Forbes Avenue, which runs 
directly through the center-of 
Squirrel Hill.
My main concern is that we 
provide service that gets people 
to where they want to go safely, 
LaPaglia said. Weve always, 
encouraged people to use the 
service, and obviously a lot of 
people do.
Murphy said that another issue 
being considered independently 
of both the question of restricting 
the current route and the ques
tion of adding a Squirrel Hill route 
concerns the purchase of a new 
shuttle bus. The first bus was 
purchased eight years ago, ac
cording to Murphy, while the 
second was purchased four years 
ago to act as a back-up and to help 
alleviate crowding during peak 
hours.
Martin, Murphy, and LaPaglia 
are scheduled to meet on Friday 
with Director of Campus Opera
tions Michael Corletti and Vice 
President for Enrollment William 
Elliott to discuss the issue.
Birthright
some Senators since to join CFP 
you must be a member of a frater
nity. A motion was made to refer 
this to the Rules committee, with 
three objections. The motion 
passed, 10-7-2.
Rules  Michael Witbrock: 
Rules met last week. They dis
cussed interpretation of the 
Constitution.
General Discussion: Neigh
bor appointed a committee of the 
following: Brockmann, Witbrock, 
Ginsburg, Simms, Ruben, and 
Peter Pezaris, with Neighbor 
chairing. The committee will come 
to an understanding of what the 
Constitution says and will decide 
if the Constitution needs chang
ing and if CFP will be funded.
Everyone should be careful 
about what they say and their 
assumptions about groups and 
their lifestyles.
The Buggy committee was dis
cussed. It was formed around the 
end of October. Responses were 
difficult to get. They had one 
meeting so far and decided that 
representation was low.
The surveys about the Activi
ties Fee were not Senates but 
Zuckers.
Brockmann pointed out that 
F&Rs recommendations are not 
binding.
Is there going to be a referen
dum on the ballot about raising 
the Activities Fee? F&R is work
ing on this. Read Conards edito
rial in the last Student Union 
raising the Fee.
Witbrock thanked ATOs presi
dent for his letter in The Tartan.
Announcements: Senior
Speaker applications are avail
able in the office of Student Af

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  17 April 19909
AIDS continues to spread quietly through state communities
By WILPEN GORR 
& ANDREW GOLUB
Special to The Tartan
Despite considerable publicity in the 
mass media, few people consider the 
AIDS epidemic to be of immediate and 
personal concern. And yet, teenagers, 
young adults, and others are increas
ingly at risk of being infected. Given the 
deadly nature of the disease  over 
70,000 people have already died from 
AIDS in this countryit is important to 
ask why it still appears so remote.
First, human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV) infection is a particularly insidi
ous disease. It can remain in the body 
with no outward symptoms for roughly 
10 years on the average before convert
ing to full-blown AIDS. It is unlikely, 
therefore, that many AIDS cases will 
appear in high school or university stu
dent populations. Even when HIV infec
tion occurs in teenagers, AIDS will likely 
not appear until the mid to late twenties. 
So university students have no outward 
signs of the epidemic.
During the long latent period before 
conversion, an infected person can un
suspectingly transmit the virus to others 
through vaginal, anal, or oral sex; by 
sharing intravenous needles; and 
through contact with infected blood, ei
ther by transfusion or through an open 
iesion (sore). At this time there is no 
cure. Death follows on the average a 
little over two years after the onset of 
AIDS. Measures to prevent HIV trans
mission include chastity, monogamous 
relations, condoms, rigorous tests of blood 
donations, special precautions for health 
workersanything that will disconnect 
aperson from the pathways of transmis
sion.
Second, AIDS is seen as a disease of 
the male gay population and intrave
nous drug users, two groups initially 
infected widely with the disease in this 
country. But there are many bridges 
from individuals engaged in these risky 
behaviors to the general population; for 
example, bisexual men, athletes who
share needles for steroid injections, in
travenous drug users who share needles, 
crack cocaine users (because of their as
sociation with intravenous drug users 
and cracks sexual arousal effects), run
aways who have been prostitutes/drugusers and are now back in the general 
population, etc. An ongoing study of blood 
samples from hospital patients being 
conducted by the Centers for Disease 
Control found two to three percent of 
21-year olds in high risk areas like New 
York City and Miami are already in
fected.
AIDS south refers to AIDS in the 
southern hemisphere, where the HIV is 
thought to have originated. There it is 
primarily a heterosexually transmitted 
disease, likely because of promiscuous 
behavior, unprotected sexual intercourse, 
and open lesions caused by other sexu
ally-transmitted diseases.
Analogous but less intense conditions 
exist in this country for teenagers and 
young adults. One research center re
ports that each year one out of six teen
agers contracts a sexually-transmitted 
disease; furthermore, one out of six sexu
ally active high school girls has had at 
least four different partners. A major 
1988 study of college students clearly 
demonstrated the health risks that many 
older adolescents were taking. Of the 
899 students participating in the study, 
70 percent had engaged in sexual inter
course and only 25 percent of the sexu
ally active students used condoms, while 
6 percent used condoms and spermi
cides. More recent studies have shown 
the use of condoms to be increasing, and 
this is certainly a good sign.
Lastly, publicity has focused on num
bers infected now and in the future, but 
most people have little idea of the geo
graphic extent of the epidemic. In brief, 
there have been no maps published to 
bring the epidemic literally home to 
people, to help them understand that the 
HIV may be very close at hand. Today, 97 
percent of the counties in the United 
States have people infected with HIV.
The map sequence for Pennsylvania,
These maps document the 
spread of the AIDS virus 
throughout Pennsylvania.
The virus can go 
undetected in humans for 
as long as ten years, 
making testing for virus 
antibodies essential for 
those who think that they 
may have been exposed to 
the disease or who are in 
groups of people that are 
considered at high risk to 
contract the disease. 
Confidential testing is 
available at the Carnegie 
Mellon Student Health 
Center. Additionally, 
anonymous and 
confidential testing is 
offered through the 
Allegheny County Health 
Department.

accompanying this letter, was produced 
by Professor Peter Gould, of the Depart
ment of Geography at Penn State, by 
interpolating contour lines from cumu
lative cases-per-county data. By the end 
of1988 the state had 2401 reported AIDS 
cases with 230 in Allegheny County and 
1285 in Philadelphia County. However, 
the number of HIV-infected persons is 
much higher than the number of AIDS 
cases because of the exponential growth 
rate of HIV infection and the lengthy 
time for an HIV infection to convert to 
full-blown AIDS. According to simula
tion models we have been developing, 
the AIDS distribution shown for 1988 
mirrors the HIV distribution of the early 
1980s. By now, HIV-infected people in 
Allegheny County likely number in the 
thousands.
The current HIV prevalence rate for 
university students is three per thou
sand for undergraduates, estimated from 
a national study. This estimate is reli
able and roughly the same as that pro
vided by more than 2 million seropositivity tests given to young men and women 
volunteers for military service. The lat
ter sample is particularly indicative of 
young heterosexual America, since 
homosexuals and IV drug users tend not 
choose a military life style. A rate of 
three per thousand yields an estimate of 
roughly 20 HIV-infected students at 
Carnegie Mellon and 70 at the Univer
sity of Pittsburgh.
Anyone who suspects that he or she 
may have been exposed to the risk of HIV 
infection should get a blood test to deter
mine health status. An infected person 
would want to take precautions to pro
tect others from infection. Also, recently 
drugs such as AZT have been shown to 
postpone the onset of AIDS in HlV-infected individuals in addition to provid
ing benefits for AIDS patients. A lot has 
been learned about this disease since it 
was formally recognized in the early
1980s; hopefully some good treatments 
will be found.
The Carnegie Mellon Health Depart
ment will provide confidential testingonly the patient and care provider are 
informed of test resultsand the Al
legheny County Health Department 
provides free, completely anonymous 
testing. The patient should use a code 
instead of his/her name in the Countys 
testing process. In interpreting such a 
test, one should realize that there is a 
significant chance of false positive 
results, as is the case with most medical 
diagnostic testing. In other words, if a 
person tests positive for HIV, then addi
tional testing is necessary to confirm or 
disprove the initial test. False nega
tives are generally much less likely, so 
a person testing negative can place faith 
in a no-infection diagnosis.

Global warming, deforestation, ozone depletion, and acid rain are 
environmental problems that affect the quality of life as well as our 
economic stance. To ensure our environmental future, we must 
educate and prepare upcoming generations for the decisions they will 
have to make. What better way to accomplish this goal than through the 
leadership of scientists, engineers, faculty, and students on your campus. 
The National Science and Technology Week encourages groups to 
design activities that stress solutions towards the preservation of our
environ ment
 Invite people to your campus to learn about your various environmentally 
oriented programs. Suggest that individual departments organize exhibits or 
demonstrations of their projects.Suggest that your professors or instructors 
present teacher-training workshops that focus on elementary and middle school 
science curriculum development. Use the campus as the workshop site. Select 
speakers to give talks on environmental issues on your campus. Choose from 
among your staff or ask some notable person from the community or state. Urge 
your school of business administration to solicit assistance from local businesses 
and industrial organizations to establish a university/industry cooperative 
environmental awareness program in the community. Get the word out by 
supplying the campus public information office with news features about scientific 
and technological innovations and about research performed at your institution. 
Suggest that student newspapers and faculty newsletters to devote a section on 
current issues in science. Invite Members of Congress, state government officials, 
and business leaders to your campus to meet with the students and teachers who 
work to make science and technology a vital part of our lives.
We hope you will plan events and activities for National Science & 
Technology Week 90. We will, of course, be happy to supply you with NSTW 
posters, education, and publicity materials.

Rush deserves Senate funding
. .. On Saturday, Student Senates 
Funding and Recognition ComTnittee approved an allocation of 
$15,450 from the Activities Fee to 
;,',&nd Dry Rush for fraternities 
and sororities.
Broken down by house, that 
translates to $400 per semester 
Tor each fraternity and $425 per 
gpmester for each sorority.
.... -We believe that one of the pur
poses' of the Activities Fee is to 
"support activities that involve 
students and draw them out of 
classrooms, studios, and study 
lounges. Money that is spent to 
reduce academic tensions is 
'f&oney well spent.
Dry Rush steadily draws large 
numbers of students. The Greek 
system spends a tremendous 
amount of time and energy adver
tising, planning, and program
ming for Rush.
The events sponsored at Dry 
Rush are similar to events that 
We willingly pay for  like AB, 
!ipDC, and Residence Hall events.
When these groups hold events, 
we call them programming and 
justify the expenditures because 
they are important for personal 
development and recreation.
Rush accomplishes the same 
goals.
Unlike recruitment events spon
sored by any other campus groups, 
everyone can attend Rush events 
and have fun  whether or not 
they intend to join a house.
Rush activities are open to all 
students. The value students re
ceive from the $15,450 proposed 
for Rush activities  in terms of 
the number of students attending 
and the amount of fun they have
 is likely to greatly exceed the 
value students will get from the 
$15,500 that AB Coffeehouse 
wanted for next year.
We think Student Senate should 
fund Dry Rush  its an activity 
that is at least as deserving as 
many other activities Senate has 
chosen to throw money at in the 
past.
Having fun somewhere in time
Volumarnival finally arrives Thurs
day after months of preparation 
by the organizers and partici
pants. For four days Carnegie 
"Mellon will be transformed into a 
different campus  one where 
fan, not work, is the objective.
-" Elsewhere in this issue you can 
read about the many upcoming 
events. Theres a lot happening, 
/so here are our suggestions for 
^getting the most out of Carnival.
First, if you can, get a lot of 
sleep tonight and tomorrow night
 you wont get many more 
chances the rest of the week.
^ Before Carnival begins, walk 
by the Midway once or twice to see 
the booths being assembled. Find 
out where all of the parties will be 
over the weekend.
_ Spend Thursday as your warm
up day. Between those final few 
.classes you attend, buy ride tick
ets at the Info Desk to save money. 
Also attend the buggy design

on the Gym lawn, in the Chute, 
and at the top of Flagstaff Hill.
 Friday afternoon check out the 
arts and crafts fair and see Mi
chael Spiro. In the evening, check 
out Scotch.n Sodas Trapped in 
The Silver Screen and the Laser 
Show before attending parties.
Saturday morning, check out 
the buggy finals. Again, dont be
lieve the program  they wont 
begin until at least 9 am. After the 
races, go home and nap  youll 
need the sleep to make it through 
Saturday night.
After you wake up, walk 
through the Midway and check 
out the tent one last time before 
the awards ceremony. Then get 
ready to spend the night partying 
at whatever party or parties youve 
chosen. Take Escort home or find 
a sober driver when you finally 
chose to retire.
Sleep late on Sunday until the

As I read David

whelmed by the magnitude of his non
sensical rambling, that I was at a loss as 
to where to begin.
By the time I finished reading the col

with the situation would be more likely 
to laugh at the blindness of the writer 
than to pay any serious attention to this 
attempt to delude the student body. Many 
others and I are just fed up with columns 
like this which are pro-Israel and antieverything else (Palestinians, Arab coun

cerely hope that next time, Schwartz 
writes a rational column based on facts 
and reality, not on run-away emotions 
and prejudice. I need not respond fur

By reading A. S.
Goldmans Discover 
the difference between 
rock and pop [4/10], 
one can get a pretty 
good example of the typical hate by 
music fans toward different types of 
music. Music today is greatly segre
gated thanks mostly to fans and radio 
station program directors who refuse to 
try any music that doesnt fit into a 
certain format.
Generally, when it comes to different 
types of music, people automatically close 
their minds and reject it. Just read the 
results of the annual Rolling Stone read
ers poll, and youll see what I mean. 
Many people, like the above mentioned
writer, seem to hate popular music for a 
reason that could only be because its 
popular (Ive actually heard a store 
worker say he hates all bands because 
they are popular! Does this mean I should 
stop listening to The Cure because 
Lovesong went to number two on the 
national Hot 100?).
These people are quick to put down an 
artist without really listening to their 
music. For example, is Madonna really a 
Silly Slut? Would a Silly Slut still be 
successful after recording albums for 
seven years? It makes me wonder 
whether these people like any music 
groups today at all. With great artists 
like Prince, Terence Trent DArby, The 
Stone Roses, and Kate Bush around, 
they have no reason for their negative
attitudes.
The most prominent other music 
sucks people are metal and rap fans 
who ironically listen to styles of music 
that are not all that different. Listen to 
Guns N Roses andN. W. A. or Enuff Znuff 
and De La Soul. There are a lot of simi
larities there, but these two groups of 
fans close their minds to the other stylfe. ( 
And when a band like the Beastie Bo#s 
tries to bridge the two styles, they get. 
labeled by both groups as silly.
Basically what Im trying to say in this 
letter is to listen to music before you 
label it. And before I forget, Madonna is 
not a Silly Slut.

I dont understand it.
An hour ago I went to 
Student Health Serv- LttiT tO 
ices in an attempt to EcJitOf
alleviate my sore 
throat. I knew perfectly well I had a cold 
and that there is no cure for a cold. But 
as anyone whos ever had a cold knows, 
you can relieve the pain. I live off-cam
pus and generally want to avoid having 
to go home for aspirin.
When I arrived, they told me to sign in. 
Fine with me. They then told me that I 
have to wait for a nurse before I can get 
some Tylenol or Advil. I explained to the 
secretary that these were over-thecounter drugs and that all I wished for 
was one of those free sample packets. 
She declined to give me any, and walked 
away.
Last semester I had similar problems 
and wished for a Sudafed. Back then I 
happened to have come at a bad time,
when it was close to lunch time and all 
but one of the nurses, unbeknownst to 
me, had left for lunch. So I patiently 
waited a full hour. To do what? To have 
the nurse tell me that their budget is low 
this year and that I couldnt have any 
Sudafed. I had to settle for a freaking 
Tylenol, after waiting an hour\ No mat
ter how much I pleaded for a more appro
priate product, she just gave me Tylenol 
and told me that if I wanted Sudafed I 
could go and buy it myself. What kind of 
attitude is that?! I knew perfectly well 
that Sudafed was available since my 
friend had some from there also.
So this time around, I didnt ask for a 
nurse or any analysis, and Im told I have 
to sit and wait. For what? To get some 
Tylenol? As if Im going to wait at least 
fifteen minutes to have my tongue prod
ded, for a nurse to argue that I dont have 
a temperature and my heart beat and 
blood pressure are normal just to so she 
can tell me that all she can give me is a
Tylenol.
Most people know when they have -a. 
cold, and also know when they thiiik. 
they should see a nurse about it. What If 
I dont want a nurse? What if I want la 
simple analgesic? You say that there are 
complications when CMU just dispenses 
over the counter drugs freely? Last year 
I got one of those Good Stuff boxes. It h 
Tylenol, Comtrex, even a razor that J 
could kill myself with! Did I kill mysel f? ^ 
Yeah, right. So how in the hell could 3. 
hurt myself with Tylenol? My RA even 
had a box full of those generic cold reme
dies that Health Services dispenses (or 
make that, used to dispense). And this 
box was given to her by CMU!
So why am I bitching? Well, Student, 
Health Services should freely and will-, 
fully give out an over-the-counter drug, 
especially analgesics, to CMU student's 
who ask for it. Why do you have to make 
it so hard to get some relief? I really

Lets bury the dead.
Thats how Michael J.
Ewedosh opened his 
column last week.
Thats a great idea, but 
let/s not forget those who caused the 
dead to need the burying in the first 
place.
Kevin Tunell killed Susan Herzog. 
Thats a fact. Tunell was convicted of 
manslaughter. Another fact. In many 
drunk driving cases involving the death 
of a third party, a lawsuit appeared. In 
this case, $1.5 million was the price. In
stead of going for the big bucks as other 
parents would have, the Herzogs settled 
out of court. 
Rather than forcing Tunells parents 
to mortgage their house and end up in 
debt for the rest of their lives trying to 
pay the $1.5 million, the Herzogs settled 
out of court with a deal that would pun
ish only Kevin: $1 a week until the year 
2000.
In our opinion, we think that this outof-court settlement is much better than 
the original lawsuit.
Ewedosh seems to differ. Thats great, 
and we respect (not endorse) his opinion. 
However, he makes the Herzogs out to be 
the bad guys in this case, which we cant 
tolerate. In his column, Ewedosh por
trays the Herzogs as having the right to 
punish Kevin for what he did and using 
the judge in one of Virginias civil court
rooms to do just that. The Herzogs iarent 
the Mafia, paying off judges or manipu
lating the court systems. They wanted 
Tunell to pay for his negligence and by 
settling out of court, they got what they 
wanted.
The key point here is that both parties 
agreed to the settlement. Tunell decided 
to pay the $1 a week, before the lawsuit 
was ever settled in court. It was his
choice and if he doesnt like it now, he 
has no one to blame except himself.
Maybe at that time, Tunell thought hfc 
was saving himself $1,499,064. We dont 
know.
Kevin Tunell now wants out of the 
deal. Ewedosh supports him. We dis
agree. Ewedosh wrote, How many more 
times do they want him to relive that 
New Years Day in 1982? Our response 
(and the Herzogs would probably agrep 
with us) is that at least he can relive 
something, anything  unlike Susan 
Herzog.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  17 April 199011
AisSa agdic ece- agea iynf bCMbTyenn- cyag redag Ae- eMMdieTgysh
Its been 20 years since the first 
Earth Day demonstration, and 
today newspapers and magazines 
across the country are running 
special sections with increasing 
frequency, with many more slated 
for publication later this week.
But amidst all the enthusiasm 
and fervor surrounding the an
nual environmental event, there 
exists an undercurrent of cyni
cism that is not without justifica
tion. The people who are touting 
banners of environmental con
sciousness this week may well be 
the same people who top-up the 
fuel tank on their poorly-tuned, 
oil-burning 79 Buick Regals enroute to the local fast food outlet, 
where they will purchase a bagful 
of Styrofoam containers. They will 
ponder the state of the environ
ment from their poorly-insulated 
houses, while outside, a 
Chemlawn truck saturates their 
pristinely-manicured grass with 
herbicides. Its 20 years later, 
and now its just a bunch of yup
pies making a statement, said a
p.
Randy Udavcak
disgruntled friend concerning the 
Earth Day craze.
Each year, a tremendous 
amount of effort is directed to
ward stiffening government in
dustrial regulations, and new acts 
are passed to deal with some of 
the more visible national prob
lems. Sadly, however, many of 
these measures amount to little 
more than legislative masturba
tion.
Case in point: each year Con
gress grapples with the latest 
round of proposals for raising the 
Corporate Average Fuel Economy 
(CAFE) regulations for new car 
producers. As its name implies, 
the measure mandates a certain 
average fuel economy rating (27.5 
mpg for 1990) for the total prod
ucts of each domestic car manu
facturer. The problem is that not 
only does the number allow a
generous proportion of gas-guzzlers to be averaged in with more 
efficient cars, but it is also pos
sible to get around the standard 
entirely. One of the more unique 
strategies is a new one employed 
by Ford. Despite the popularity of 
its smaller models, a substantial 
amount of the companys profits 
continue to be made from large, 
thirsty, V-8 sedans. In order to 
meet higher CAFE regulations, 
the company is increasing the 
number of foreign-built compo
nents in its Crown Victoria and 
Mercury Marquis models, thereby 
enabling the popular road barges 
to be declared as imports. Next, 
the company pumps out a multi
tude of self-destructing Escorts, 
and presto, the domestic CAFE 
number is met!
While the intentions of the 
aforesaid regulations are noble 
enough, there must be a noncomitant individual effort. The road to 
environmental protection and 
energy efficiency passes through
Washington, but does not begin 
there. While industrial pollution 
is an importantpiece of the puzzle 
of environmental degradation, 
many of the more troublesome 
sources (e.g., inefficient autos, 
wasteful food packaging designs, 
non-biodegradable materials, etc. 
ad nauseum) continue to be con
sumer-driven. Just as Americas 
portion of the global problem is of 
a national scope, so too must be 
the solution.
But even when consciousness is 
raised, it is often stifled through 
lack of encouragement. I do not 
pretend to be an ardent environ
mentalist, but at the same time, I 
refuse to follow the example of 
some of my contemporaries who 
pour used engine oil down the 
sewer. But while environmental 
and recycling agencies implore 
consumers not to dump old oil, all 
the . agencies in the Pittsburgh 
area I have talked to have no idea 
what to do with the stuff. Thats 
a good question, responded one 
recycling center official I spoke
with. I now have over five gallons 
of old oil in my garage  every
thing from 5W-30 to 20W-50. 
While I know it cant be used^pr 
engine oil any longer, Im tcjjd 
that it can be re-refined into lower 
viscosity machine oil. Still, we 
only handle aluminum cans,"Is 
the typical response from most 
agencies. I dont even get a chance 
to tell them about my four-gallon 
collection of used glycol-based 
antifreeze that I was also told ritit 
to throw out.
Even if Earth Day is just i&e 
rantings of of yuppies and fairweather environmentalists as liiy 
friend suggested, its still a start 
to raising their consciousness to 
some very serious problems. New 
if we could just tell them where to 
take their used oil....
Randy Udavcak is a sophomtife 
professional writing / applied his
tory major who has some cheap,oil 
for sale, if anyone is interested. 
This is his first column for l*Ae 
Tartan.
Keep it off the street and out of court
Theres at least one Allegheny 
County judge who wont be 
found in the Courthouse this 
week.
Common Pleas Judge Robert 
Dauer can be found on the third 
floor of the David L. Lawrence 
Convention Center in a make
shift courtroom of about 5,000 
square feetnearly as large as 
the Skibo Ballroom.
Dauer has spent the last few 
days instructing Allegheny 
County Sheriffs Deputies to 
transport nearly 100 people to 
the Convention Center to be 
considered to serve on a jury.
The reason the case is being 
heard in the Convention Cen
ter is that there are 68 defen
dants in what Dauer called the 
largest criminal trial in the 
county, and possibly the state.
These 68 people were arrested 
late last October for failing to 
disperse when instructed to do 
so outside of Allegheny Repro
ductive Health Center on South 
Highland Avenue.
If convicted on the charges, 
they face prison charges of up 
to two years and fines of up to 
$5,000.
The punishment sounds stiff, 
but the defendants have been 
given ample opportunity to 
evade it. Most of the pro-life 
supporters who protested out
side the clinic were given the 
chance to escape trial and a 
conviction record by accepting 
a smaller fine and completing 
some community service work.
Michael J. Ewedosh
Those who are now defendants 
are those who refused to settle.
The protestors say that they 
were there to stop the murder of 
unborn children. They believe that 
abortion is wrong and that it 
should be banned. They are com
pletely entitled to believe so, and 
even to try to convince others that 
they are right.
Now they are in court, and some 
have said that making the abor
tion issue the centerpiece of the 
trial cannot be avoided. Mean
while, Judge Dauer has vowed to 
prevent that from happening.
These 68 people have chosen to 
wrestle the wrong arm of the law. 
In the United States, it is clear 
that the legislative branch of 
government makes laws, the 
executive branch enforces them, 
and the judicial branch interprets 
them on a case-by-case basis.
In 1973, the Supreme Court 
ruled that abortion was legal. Re
gardless of whether it is right or 
wrong, their decision is binding.
If these protestors want the law 
changed, they must appeal either 
to Congress or to the Pennsylva
nia General Assembly and ask, 
prod, coerce, or otherwise con
vince those bodies that such a 
change is necessary.
Instead, they have chosen to 
take the issue to Robert Dauers
courtroom. When all is said and 
done, this trial will do nothing 
for their cause.
They will achieve many other 
things in this trial, though. 
They will cost the taxpayers of 
Pennsylvania and Allegheny 
County a great deal of money. 
They will tie up at least one 
judge. And they will have al
ready gone through truckloads 
of juries trying to set up the 
trial.
When the trial ends, they may 
find themselves with criminal 
records and a new place to stay
 the Allegheny County jail. 
Thats probably a painful civics 
lesson, but they have refused to 
accept any other solution.
Pro-life protestors and groups 
like Operation Rescue consis
tently attempt to take the law 
into their own hands. Claiming 
these groups are scheming to 
break the law, municipalities 
have even begun to use a law 
that aflows government to seize 
an organizations assets  the 
Racketeering, Influencing, and 
Corrupt Organization Law  
to make such groups financially 
responsible for the legal action 
taken against them.
Laws are made in Washing
ton and in Harrisburg, not on 
Pittsburghs streets. Its time 
that those who want abortion 
laws changed realize that and 
take their battles elsewhere.
Michael J. Ewedosh is a so
phomore in H&SS.
EARLE SWANK AWARD COMPETITION
OPEN TO FRESHMEN, SOPHOMORES, & JUNIORS
The Swank Award was established by alumnus Ronald Haan to encourage 
students to identify and, ideally, implement enhancements to student life on 
campus. Earle Swank was with the University for 40 years, as Dean of Student 
Affairs and Professor of English. An undetermined number of awards will be 
given, ranging in size from $500 to $2000. Currently, we have eighteen Swank 
Scholars working on eight projects on campus.
Students interested in applying for a Swank Scholarship for the coming year must 
submit a proposal identifying some project to improve student life on campus.
Proposals may be of any length and should include the following: problem 
statement, background information, documentation of need, proposed solution, 
anticipated impact, management plan, budget, available resources, time line for 
implementation, and evaluation plan. Proposals may include any other information 
deemed relevant by the student. Proposals may be submitted by individuals or 
groups.
The criteria for evaluating the proposals will include the clarity of problem or 
concern addressed, legitimacy of need, nature and extent of impact on campus, 
depth of research, feasibility of proposed solution, completeness of proposal, 
quality of presentation and format.
Proposals should be submitted to the Student Affairs Office, Warner Hall 206. 
Proposals will be reviewed twice during the year and deadlines for submission 
are February 1 and May 1.
Please contact the Student Affairs Office if you would like further 
information, 268-2073.
Spring Carnival is not all fun 
and games for everyone
Inquiring Minds
t*3""Stewart Levine
In the final weeks before Carni
val, CMU retreats to its base
ments, finishing work on its 
booths and buggies, and thumbs 
its nose at the rest of the world. 
Truth be told, the rest ofthe world 
rarely notices or cares, and typi
cally continues on with its busi
ness.
Then comes April 22 when the 
hangovers start to ease and stu
dents start to read newspapers 
and watch TV again. Youll hear 
questions like: When did they 
start playingbaseball? or When 
did we name a new president? or 
When did CBS fire Pat Sajak? 
They may still think that theyre 
in that dreamland where nothing 
exists except duct tape, nails, and 
two-by-fours.
The final week before Carnival 
may be the ultimate irony in the 
Carnegie Mellon experience. A 
week exists where students are
willing to stay up all night when 
their classwork does not already 
compel them to see sunrise. Not 
only do they stay up, they do so 
right before University-sanc
tioned free time where lots of 
events will occurthathalfofthese 
people will sleep through.
Assuming that people make it 
to Carnival, theyll be able to enjoy 
all of the things that make Carni
val so special: walking through 
the fifty tons of hair spray on the 
Midway on Friday night, finding 
the closest parking spot to cam
pus at the corner of Forbes and 
Wightman, and waking up at 
home on Sunday morning with no 
recollection of how you got home, 
or why your clothes are different 
from what you remember.
However, surviving Carnival is 
usually easier than surviving the 
weeks that lead to it. Ask any 
buggy mechanic how many hours 
he or she has spent on buggy in 
the past week and see if its triple 
or only double the amount of time 
he or she spent on schoolwork. 
Then ask your mechanic friend if 
he or she remembers what classes
he or she is enrolled in.
And when Carnival is ovfjr, 
theres always that post-Carnival 
depression which sets in. People 
find themselves with twenty ex
tra hours and dont know what*o 
do with them. Worse yet, theyre 
so conditioned to stay up late 
working on Carnival they cantdo 
the one thing they need to do^- 
sleep. Inevitably they do another 
thing Carnegie Mellon students 
like to do after hours  drink/1
With all of the problems Carni
val causes, one wonders why hawe 
it at all? Some people who get put 
on probation might still be here 
and we wouldnt have to worry 
about buggy funding, period. 
Maybe it gives all of the Type A 
personalities something to do fqr 
three months, but I think its 
simply because its the only way 
we could get a Friday off around 
here.

masters candidate in GSIA. He is

Do you really need that burger every day?
Some of you tough manly men 
can officially start calling me a 
flimpwrist pussy because a few 
weeks ago I decided to give up 
meat and hopefully Ill be able to 
resist any and all temptations to 
ever eat it again. Im still eating 
fish and cheese and dairy prod
ucts but other than that, Ive 
shifted to vegetarianism. One of 
the things about eating pound 
after pound of yummy delicious 
meat is that unfortunately it is all 
too easy to block out just what it is 
you are really eating.
For those of you who eat at 
McDonalds and are hypnotized 
by the drawings of happy little 
cows, you might be interested to 
lrnow that those happy little cows 
graze on hundreds of thousands if 
not millions of acres of what were 
once Brazilian rain forests that 
have been cleaned out using DDT, 
Agent Orange, and other tasty 
dioxins. These pesticides were 
outlawed in the U.S. quite some 
time ago but McDonalds conven
iently employs South American 
peasants in countries where those 
poisons can be used legally.
Ever wonder why items on the
Is Neil Peart your god?
Marc Fischer
menus of fast food chains taste 
the same no matter what part of 
the world you eat them in? Did 
you know McDonalds uses a 
dozen chemicals in their lettuce 
alone just to insure that it tastes 
the same in Canada as it tastes in 
California as it tastes in Kansas? 
Imagine how many chemicals 
wind up in the burgers. Did you 
know that eating certain ham
burgers on the menu at Wendys 
provides you with an entire daily 
allowance of fat  all from just 
one hamburger you may have had 
for dinner.
If you think every hamburger 
youve eaten came from a healthy 
smiling cow, well think again, 
because the sick cows get thrown 
in the grinder too, along with any 
small animals that get in the way. 
Imagine this: fill Three River 
Stadium to the brim with cows 
(probably a daily supply for 
McDonalds restaurants around
the world). Now try taking the 
time to find the ones that are 
hopelessly diseased. Sound like 
an impossible task? Do you think 
South American peasants being 
paid slave wages bother? Neither 
do I. Did you know that 55% of 
Americas total supply of antibi
otics is used on livestock? Did you 
know the reason for this is that 
the animals are so badly mis
treated that if the antibiotics 
werent used, theyd be dead be
fore they made it to the slaugh
terhouse?
Next time you scarf down a 
burger crammed with all the shit 
from a cow that few people would 
eat knowingly like marrow and 
tumors and eyeballs, remember 
that if Americans alone reduced 
their meat intake by only 10%, 
the grain saved from feeding that 
livestock could adequately feed 
60,000,000 people. That statistic, 
from the book Diet For a New 
America which was published in 
1987, also happens to correspond 
with another one: 60,000,000 
people will starve to death this 
year. 40,000 children starved to 
death yesterday. The same num
ber will starve to death today and 
tomorrow and the day after that. 
Im sorry if it sounds like Im 
preaching and I know this is a 
pretty depressing column, but is 
the starvation of millions really 
worth your need to eat a burger, 
hot dog, or roast beef sandwich 
every day?
Cutting out meat entirely is not 
convenient if you are on the meal 
plan here. Its a very personal 
decision, and surely not one Im 
demanding from anyone. I had 
my own reasons and they were 
just that, my reasons. But reduc
ing your meat intake a little in 
hopes of just possibly seeing some 
of the grain and water that was 
intended for American livestock 
settled in the stomach of a mal
nourished Indian or Ethiopian 
child is something that would be 
nice to see more people thinking 
about.
In the immortal words of the 
California punk band M.D.C., 
Starving children deserve a 
break today.

You can only be young once, but you can be immature forever
Quickly, I dont want to go home. 
Tanning tends to make your attention 
wander. It took me a minute to under
stand what he said. What?
I dont want to go home. I want to stay 
here for the summer. Well, not exactly. I 
want to stay here with all my friends this 
summer. Itll be more fun.
You can party at home.
Its not partying. Its freedom.
The sun must really be getting to me; 
I was completly lost for a second. What
 huh? Did you just downplay party
ing?
All right. Maybe its because time is 
winding down, and I know Ill be gone
Don Pickett
soon, or maybe its just the natural pro
gression of events and experience; actu
ally, its probably a combination of all of 
them. Lately, Ive been noticing that the 
thing I enjoy most about school is the 
freedom. I can do whatever I want, when
ever I want, and answer to no one but 
myself.
Yeah, it is cool, isnt it?
Yep. Its like, well, when I went home
for spring break, I was constrained. It 
wasnt that my parents were constrain
ing me on purpose, but after seven 
months of living on my own, I was forced 
to live by someone elses schedule, some
one elses rhythms. It felt constraining. 
I didnt like it.
I know what you mean. When you 
look at it, in a calm moment, its not the 
partying, it's not all the things you do 
because you can  steal stuff, take 
peoples doors off their hinges, whatever
 its the things that are so pervasive 
that you miss them. Being able to set 
your own agenda, your own schedule, 
things like that.
You know, it sounds like youre dan
gerously close to being grown up. 
Never! Remember my motto.
Death before dishonor, drugs before 
lunch?
No  the other one.
You can only be young once, but you 
can be immature forever?
Thats it.
Dumb motto.
Dick. Shut up and face the facts. Youre 
growingup, and beginning to enjoy things 
that dont involve altering your brain 
chemistry and loud music. Its a fact of 
life  enjoy it. It doesnt mean you have 
to stop doing the other things; its just
that youve got more options. All in all, 
its not a bad change.
My parents warned me this would 
happen. ;
Well, they were right. And if youd  
just calm down and stop worrying that" 
life ends at 22, then maybe you wouldnt 
be taking up so much of my peak tanning 
time. So please, calm down, grab a towel, 
and join me.
You sure about this growing up thing? 
Can you stop aging?
No.
Im sure.

Dining Service should cater to all
Editor:
We feel we 
must preface 
this letter by Letter tO 
stating that we, EditOf
in no way, con
sider ourselves advocates for all 
Jews on this campus.
We are complaining about the 
insensitivity on the part of the 
Carnegie Mellon Dining Service 
towards Jewish students during 
Passover last week.
CMDS advertised that it would 
be providing food to keep in com
pliance with the Passover tradi
tion of eating only unleavened 
bread. In Kiltie, gefilte fish, matzo 
bread, and matzo ball soup were 
provided throughout the week, 
which were appreciated. How
ever, many times, for lunch and/ 
or dinner throughout the week, 
all of the main entrees were served 
on or with bread or were made
from leavened flour.
One cannot expect students to 
eat salads or vegetarian dishes 
for an entire week if they are not 
accustomed to doing so. Why did 
the veal and fish served have to 
be breaded? And then to serve 
breaded meat on a white bread 
bun? Jewish or not, a person 
should not eat that much bread at 
any time.
Contrary to popular stere
otypes, not all Jewish people are 
wealthy. Many people were forced 
to go out to eat during the week in 
order to keep with tradition. Some 
students chose to eat their meals 
at Bnai Brith Hillel, so as to 
properly observe the holiday. This 
forced these people to waste 
meals on their contracts, since 
they were not reimbursed for the 
meals they missed. In addition, 
they had to pay Hillel in order to 
eat there. The rest of the students
had to break tradition simply be
cause they could not afford to eat 
out or were much too pressed for 
time.
All races, cultures, and relig
ions are entitled to sensitivity and 
respect on this campus. The meal 
planners generally do a good job 
because fish is appropriately 
served on Fridays during lent, 
and there is always at least one 
vegetarian entree with every 
meal. But, in the future, the meal 
planners should show some dis
cretion when planning meals that 
will fall on those religious holi
days that are a bit more obscure 
to the mainstream.

SPORTSPEAK

Etiquette for the 
socially moronic
CJiches catch up with all of us 
at sjsme point. Youre reading 
their latest victim.
For almost every public event, 
some yo-yo produces a list of 
social graces. Because I consider 
myself to be as significant a yo
yo as anyone, I have come up an 
etiquette list for baseball.
The Ten Commandments for 
Vieitfing Live Baseball:
1) Thou shalt not fake singing 
the [National Anthem. Dont try 
to impress your date by singing 
in another language either. It 
wont work. If you dont know 
the words and cant see the 
matrix board for prompting, 
just scream Go [insert team 
name here]! until the music 
stops.
2) Thou shalt not fill up on 
food when first entering the 
stadium. Even if youre starv
ing, filling your arms with food 
and then trying to find your 
seat is stupid and very embar
rassing to those with you. The 
S.O.P. is to grab a dog and 
munch on it while walking to 
your seat. Then, come the fifth 
inning when youre really 
hungry, you can send the loser 
in the group to go shopping at 
the refreshment stand.
3) Thou shalt not spew forth 
information unless truly knowl
edgeable. The greatest triumph
I ever felt was when I shot down 
some idiot who was regaling the 
people around him with his 
insight. if I had a dollar for 
every time I had to correct 
someone on the infield fly rule...
4) Thou shalt not shout ob
scenities at umpires if seated in 
earshot of said umpires. You 
may feel safe and secure in your 
$17 box seat, but people have to 
realize that an umpire has the 
power to throw players and fans 
out of the ballpark. But, I must 
admit, seeing that look of 
shocked horror on some idiots 
face as the ushers toss him on 
the direction of the umpire is 
often worth the price of admis
sion.
5) Thou shalt not get drunk if 
seated higher than the first 
deck. Throwing up on your 
shoes is bad enough. Throwing 
up on some guys shoes, wife, 
and child 40 feet below is just 
plain rude.
6) Thou shalt not participate 
in the wave. This moronic 
spectacle isjfine for football, but 
a batter cant concentrate on the 
pitch when a bunch of clowns in 
the outfield are jumping up and 
down like they just downed a 
Igallon of picante sauce.
7) Thou shalt not put ketchup 
on a hot dog. I know this is 
America and all, but if the 
classic dog with mustard and 
onions is good enough for Clint 
Eastwood, then its good enough 
for me, by God.
8) Thou shalt not make obnox
ious noises. Animal calls and air 
horns are fine for hockey, but 
not baseball. If you feel you 
cannot express yourself by yell'ing or with a good strong two
fingered whistle, you need help.
9) Thou shalt not covet thy 
neighbors empty seats. If you 
Pay for the cheap seats, expect 
to deal with the masses of the 
&reat unwashed. Bide your time 
and sneak up to the good seats 
late in the game when the usher 
isnt looking.
10) Thou shalt not leave 
before the final out. Hey, if you 
iont want to deal with traffic, 
stay home.

Take Me Out to the Bal I game...
An evening at the ballpark was a fne way for CMU students to spend their Friday night. The CMU Activities Board sold tickets 
for the Pittsburgh Pirates home opener against the Chicago Cubs at Three Rivers Stadium. Unfortunately for the local Pirates 
fans, the Cubs pulled out a 2-0 win. Above, the CMU student section at the stadium was pretty evenly dividedjunior Cathy 
Saum cheers for the Cubs from her home state of Illinois, while sophomore Jeremy Sechler roots for the hometown favorite. 
Saum and other Cubs fans can be extra happy about Chicago's 4-1 win Saturday over the Pirates. Sunday, however, the tables 
turned as the Pirates rounded out the series 2-1 with a 4-3 win over the Cubs. But the Bucs had a tough time pulling out 
the win, edging Chicago out in the tenth inning.
Regatta

stytdLee is mens tennis sole winner
By ALIM RAY
Tartan Senior Staffwriter
Due to the continued horrid 
weather, all of the CMU mens 
tennis teams matches last week 
except Fridays competition 
against the University of Pitts
burgh, which theTartans lost8-l, 
were cancelled.
Coach Richard Scheines 
thought Carnegie Mellon had a 
chance if we won number one 
singles, number two singles, and 
number three doubles.
Unfortunately, Carnegie 
Mellons number one player,
Andrew Lee, garnered the only 
point for the Tartans by beating 
his opponent.
The Tartans had already lost 
the entire match by losing five 
points out of nine before Lee had 
won. Since the next three doubles 
matches would not affect the out
come of the scoring, they were 
played in pro set style (one eight 
game set is played to determine 
the winner of the match) versus 
the best of three sets (six game 
sets), which is usually used.
The one bright spot for the team 
on Friday was Lees victory over 
Pitts number one player Terence
Rosenthal. The 3-6, 6-4, 7-5 win 
marked the second time Lee defeatedRosenthal this season. This 
win means Lee is still the best 
player in Pittsburgh and brings 
him closer to qualifying for Divi
sion III Nationals.
Ahead for the tennis team are 
matches against Washington.and 
Jefferson on Monday, and Grove 
City on Wednesday. Later in the 
month, Carnegie Mellon will 
atttend the UAA tournament and 
the PAC tournament. The UAA 
tourney will be the first time this 
season the Tartans will play a 
team in the UAA.

Lacrosse tramples over Frostburg, despite injuries
Stephen Kang/Tartan Staff Photographer
The CMU lacrosse team went head to head against Frostburg Saturday and came away 
with one of its most successful games of the season.
By STEPHEN KANG
Tartan Staffwriter
The CMU lacrosse team played its most 
incredible, if not the best, game of its season 
Saturday.
.The game was against Frostburg, at its 
home field  CMU had to travel almost 
three hours in the morning to get to the 
game. After the tiring trip, the team only 
played with nine players, since John 
Seekings, freshman Miguel Triay, and so
phomore Dave Pagani were all plagued with 
injuries.
To compensate for being a man down the 
entire game, CMU played mostly zone de
fense. Sophomore Steve Ramey, the only 
middie defense man back, played with a long 
stick. Meanwhile, two other middies were 
used only on offense, since if they played de
fense, they would have been too tired with no 
bench support.
Before the start of game, the team re
ceived a psychological boost from former 
CMU lacrosse player John Kim, who placed 
the game ball on the midfield.
Nevertheless, at the halftime, CMU was 
down 2-0. Because junior Rob Kendall 
twisted his left shoulder in the second quar
ter, the teams morale was down along with 
its physical condition.
However, team captain Bayard Johnson 
resurrected the teams effort with a brief 
speech: Come on, team. Just because were

one man short doesnt mean we have to lose.,w 
Lets play with the attitude that were gonna ~~ 
win. I dont want a long ride back home 
where we talk about how we were stranded.
The team came out firing in the second 
half as it scored five goals in the third quar
ter alone. Only two minutes into the third 
quarter, junior Phil Kaplan led a fast-break 
by himself going through the entire Frost
burg defense and scoring.
Following this play, sophomore Todd 
Bredbenner scored on a controversial kickplay. Going for the ground ball near the 
opponents box line, Bredbenner broke his 
stick, but managed to kick the ball over to 
his teammate. Then, he ran toward the 
Frostburgs goal and caught the pass with 
his broken stick. As Bredbenner dropped the 
ball on the ground, he kicked the ball into the 
goal. After a discussion, the goal was ruled 
legal, and CMU had tied the game.
After this play, CMU never looked back, as 
it continued the pounding with six more~^~

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  17 April 1990
Lacrosse morale boosted by win
continued from page 13
goals in thefourth quarter. Kendall led the scoring 
with five goals, including one at the opening of the 
fourth quarter when he caught the ball in mid-air 
one handed and shot behind the back and scored.
Also, Kaplan scored two goals, Bredbenner had 
two, Johnson with one, and junior goalie Peter Vonderlieth with one.
In addition, Vonderlieth had a record 39 saves for 
the game, and had to play without a chest pad the 
entire game because the equipment van from 
Oakmont broke down on the way to Frostburg.
The only goal so far this season for Vonderlieth 
came at the end of third quarter. As time was run
ning out, he shot the ball from midfield and scored 
just as time expired. Also, in the game, freshman 
Stephen Kang had seven assists, and freshman 
Steve Schaum won all 13 face-offs. Playing the 
middie position the entire game, Stephen Kang and 
Steve Schaum had to go up against Frostburgs 
three different middie lines and take physical 
punishment the whole game. However, CMUs 
unsung heroine was the teams trainer, Kathy
"Something like this [the 
win] brings the team closer 
together.
 Assistant Coach Scott 
Johnson
Flowers, who spent over two hours on the sideline 
wrapping and icing the injuries so the players could 
continue to play.
In the end, Carnegie Mellon won 11-2, surprising 
themselves and the opponent. Assistant coach 
Scott Johnson said, Something like this [the win] 
brings the team closer together and play that much 
better.
The Carnegie Mellon lacrosse team plays next 
against the Pitt Panthers tonight at 7 pm at Pitt 
Stadium.

continued from page 13
The Tartans did turn in some good perform
ances at the meet. Senior Dave Supp won the 
5000 meter with a time of 15:20; sophomore Jeff 
Palaima placed in long jump, triple jump, and 
pole vault; freshman Jason Lange won the discus 
and took second in the shot put; and junior Gary 
Harrison and freshman Brad Shapiro took first 
and second place in the half-mile, respectively.
In team events, the mile relay and 4x100 relay 
teams both took third place.
Weve been having a lot of problems with the 
weather and with injuries, said Meckley. The 
performances were OK, but I thought wed be 
better than we were.
Tomorrow, the team goes up against PAC foes 
Washington & Jefferson and Bethany, as well as 
Geneva College and West Liberty. However, 
Meckley has already begun to look ahead to the 
PAC and UAA championships.
Were not really going to have our team to
gether until the championships, said Meckley, 
but I think well have a good chance to win.

The booth competition builds on some historic ideas
By ERIC J. MCANALLEN
Tartan Asst. Features Editor
With Spring Carnival only two days 
away, booth building across campus has 
become a major focus of energy for many 
Greek and non-Greek organizations. This 
years theme of historical places has 
spawned many innovative and creative 
booth designs, each vying for top honors 
in carnival competition.
Here is a short glimpse of the sights 
and activities to be found on the Midway 
come Thursday.
Air Force ROTC will return to the days 
of the Korean War where participants 
will get to shoot down enemy fighters.
Alpha Epsilon Pi hopes to put out the 
Chicago Fire in its bam by having
participants throw sponges into the 
flames.
Alpha Tau Omega will defend the mid
way with its model of Fort Pitt. Here, 
participants will be able to bombard 
brothers with water balloons.
Last years fourth place winner in the 
independent division, the Asian Student 
Association, will erect its own Great 
Wall of China.
The Carnegie Involvement Association 
will tempt participants with its Garden 
of Eden.
Chi Omega, last years first place 
winner in the sorority division with its 
Jack-in-the-Box, will save carnival 
goers, in sets of two, in its highly secre
tive Noahs Ark.
Carnival goers will be taken back to
the time of the Civil War by the Com
puter Club.
The sisters of Delta Delta Delta, win
ners of the second place prize in last 
years sorority competition with their 
Candyland, will erect an authentic scale 
model of The Berlin Wall, complete 
with graffiti.
Delta Gamma sisters will protest taxa
tion without representation in Boston 
Harbor, 1773, with a tea toss. The sis
ters placed fifth with their Operation 
in last years sorority competition.
Last years first place winner in the 
Fraternity division with its Fisher Price 
Garage, Delta Tau Delta, will whisk 
participants back to the prohibition era 
and into a Chicago Speakeasy.
Delta Upsilon brothers will bring to
reality the lovable Flintstones and their 
house in pre-historic Bedrock. DUs 
Monopoly booth placed third in frater

Earth Day 1990 hits Point Park on the last day of Carnival
By DEXTER T. KOBAYASHI
Tartan Asst. Features Editor
Earth Day 1990 arrives on Sunday.
It arrives 20 years after Earth Day 
1970  the largest organized demon, stration ever. National organizations 
from the U.S., the U.S.S.R., Canada, 
China, and Japan are working to make 
Earth Day another success. Once 
again, the focus will be on environ
mental issues of the day. The issues 
that are being addressed this year: the 
 greenhouse effect, ozone holes, desert 
expansion, depletion of tropical rain 
forests, recycling, energy use, pesti
cides, transportation, water conserva
tion, and activism.
CMUs Student Environmental 
Action Coalition (SEAC) has worked 
hard to connect the many Earth Day 
officials with the Pittsburgh commu
nity. They have also built an eight by 
ten house made entirely out of alumi
num cans which will be on display 
?during Carnival. The 1600 cans were 
hot welded together and the house 
stands four and a half feet tall. Within 
the structure will be exhibits and in
formation about the environment.
SEAC will also be selling t-shirts.
At the end of Carnival, on Earth 
Day, SEAC will move the structure 
down to Point Park, Pittsburghs Earth 
Pay center. At Point Park, local bands 
will play for the public, various speak
ers will give talks on the environment, 
L-and booths from various environ* mental groups will be on display. All of 
this is being sponsored by the city of 
Pittsburgh, and KDKA will be covering 
the entire event. The Earth Day 1990 
Coalition has been preparing for the
past six months.
In the late 60s, Gaylord Nelson 
thought of the idea of Earth Day while 
he was a Wisconson senator. Not until 
California activist Denis Hayes com
bined Nelsons idea with the anti-war 
movement of the late 60s did Earth 
Day 1970 became the historic event 
that it is now known as.
This year, the worldwide event has a 
budget in excess of $4 million. Al
though it is difficult to say how many 
people will participate in Earth Day 
1990, Point Park alone is expecting 
nearly 50,000 people to attend the all
day event.
But not everyone is pleased about 
Earth Day. The March 29 issue of The 
New American says, If the insiders 
are successful, the American people 
will be convinced that they must lower 
their standard of living, boost federal 
spending and accept international 
controls in order to save the earth from 
environmental decay. Earth Day is a 
key part of this conditioning process.
In the wake of Earth Day 1970, the 
Environmental Protection Agency was 
established. There is no telling what 
might happen in the wake of Earth 
Day 1990.
Despite the concern by many people 
about the environment, there are still 
those who oppose the idea of Earth 
Day. The John Birch Society considers 
it, ... the greatest sham on earth. 
They say that there is no real proof 
that the earth is significantly warm
ing or that chemicals generated by in
dustries actually harm the environ
ment. They also state that insects 
produce as much formic acid naturally 
as man does through the emissions of
automobiles.
On the other hand, Earth Day ob
servers  mostly ordinary people con
cerned about their environment  
feel that the benefits of recy
cling aluminum cans and 
conserving water is worth 
the effort. Organized 
groups of environmen
talists think that 
the effects of even 
minute changes 
in the environ
ment have 
much greater 
impacts on 
its inhabi
tants.
Many na
tional gov
ernments 
support 
Earth Day 
because it 
addresses 
worldwide 
concerns.
Certain 
industries 
are against it 
because they 
feel that Earth 
Day is just 
hysteria aimed at 
empowering 
government control 
and will impair their 
ability to compete. Indi
viduals just want to help.

LAST TEMPTATION 
OF JAVI
by Javier Grillo-Marxuach
I didnt pick the theme for this 
week. It happened by accident. I 
didnt expect that the one com
mon thread running through the 
events of my week was going to 
be ... undergarments.
-1 have been working as the 
costume master for the current 
ScotchnSoda show. Journalistic 
ethics keep me from revealing that 
the production is an original mu
sical entitled Trapped in the Sil
lier Screen and that I wrote the 
book. In any case, one of the props 
required for the show is a pair of 
xotically printed boxer shorts. 
Because the theme of the show is 
that of exotic places and faraway 
lands, it was decided that the 
Shorts should have bananas 
printed on them.
So, it is Thursday afternoon, 
and I find myself in the middle of 
an Oakland store called Draw
ers. Somehow, the proprietors of 
lingerie shops have elevated the 
art of the single entendre to Da 
Vincean proportions. In the course 
of the week I found myself visit
ing places with names ranging 
from Cheeks to Puttin on the 
Dog. Without attempting to 
explain myself (explaining that 
they were for a play is as credible 
a qualifier as I have this friend 
... ) I ask for a pair of boxer shorts 
with a banana print. After I de
clined the boxers which have the 
word NO printed on them but 
wKich scream YES! in glo-inthe-dark letters once the lights go 
down; and the boxers with the ace 
of spades and the ones with lip 
prints on them and the ones with 
little portraits of Mel Tonn (when 
tji0 lights go down, the words dobe-ldo-be-do appear across the 
rump), I tried to make a clean 
getaway.
; But it was not to be. The sales 
person looked at this tough-nut, 
hard-case customer and gave me 
tjie ultimate, just-you-wait 
lance.
! Within the moment she re
turned with what looked like a 
cross between macram and lomejn. On the front there was an 
extremely indiscreet bit of cloth 
attached to a large stuffed ba
nana, peel and all. A zipper was 
attached to the peel in order to 
expose the flesh colored fruit be
low. Closer examination revealed
that it was up to the the wearer of 
the garment to stuff the banana 
as the case may be. I wondered 
what sort of audience reaction 
this would attract. I wondered 
what sort of reaction the actor 
wearing this would have.
As discreetly as I could (the 
sales person had this huge comeon-take-a-chance-be-daring-onlytime-in-your-life-go-for-thegusto-carpe-diem-dont-tell-meyou-cant-fill-this grin on her 
face.) I explained that it would 
not... quite do. She then began to 
demonstrate the tuxedo g-strings, 
featuring tails and bow ties in 
strategically relevant positions. 
There was this vehement air about 
her, as if she was truly convinced 
that my life would be deficient if I 
did not have a banana to stuff or 
a tux to fill.
I ran.
In frustration, I wound up in a 
mens store. I dont just mean a 
mens store, I mean, a MENS 
store. All over the place you could 
see MEN. There were butch 
MENS shirts on the racks, and 
MENS pants ruggedly folded over 
racks the color of guns and battle
ships. After an afternoon of linge
rie shops I couldnt help but be 
somewhat disoriented by this en
vironment. Then a MAN walked 
up to me. Crewcut, short sleeve 
shirt, polyblend tie in a discreet, 
tweedlike pattern with chunky 
full Windsor knot keeping the 
neck muscles from beating pas
sers by into senselessness, you 
know the type. The MAN asked 
the question, YEAH?
I tell him that I am looking for 
boxer shorts, and with a proud, 
almost military sway of his ti
tanic forearm he led me to the 
rack. There they were, all of the 
major brands, Hanes, in blue and 
white, Fruit of the Loom, in blue 
and white, and, of course, Play
boy Bikini Briefs, in blue, white 
and black (hey, even MEN need 
variety).
Actually, I was looking for 
something with....
YEAH?
By now, all of the other sales
men had turned to look at the 
drama unfolding by the under
wear rack.
... bananas.
The MEN gave each other a 
puzzled glance, then they turned 
their attention to me. 
BANANAS?
Arms were crossed, perjorative 
glances were shared, I could have 
sworn that knuckles were 
cracked, or maybe it was the sound 
of a full Windsor knot giving way.
I ran.
A few seconds later, I was safely 
nestled in the relative yuppie 
stability that is Shadyside. Once
I had acquired an appropriate pair 
of boxer shorts for the play (I 
settled for white with smiley faces 
on them, when the lights go down, 
little glo-in-the-dark smiley faces 
emerge, which will make it easy 
to find the actor in question back
stage during scene changes).
As I walked down Walnut street, 
boxer shorts discreetly wrapped 
in a brown bag (Ill leave it up to 
you to find them, I wouldnt pre
sume to deprive anyone of the 
experience I went through) I re
membered that I had to buy a 
present for my significant other.
My significant other had sug
gested that I try Victorias Secret. 
I had laughed at her and explained 
my conviction that there are no 
Victorias Secret stores in this 
vicinity. Then I turned my head 
in the direction of the nearest 
bakery and instead found myself 
face to face with the awful truth. 
VICTORIAS SECRET.
There was a strange defiance 
behind those golden letters. The 
opaque door which almost seemed 
to be daring me to try my luck 
there. I felt that through some 
twist of Karma, my life was being 
tugged into a direction I really 
had no desire to be twisted into. 
However, after cruising the seamy 
underside of ligerienalia, I felt I 
was up to anything. If I could deal 
with having someone threaten
ing to stuff me into a fruit, I could 
take Victorias Secret any day.
I crossed the street, pushed open 
the door, and found myself inside 
a mutant hybrid between a Carly 
Simon album cover and the Mar
quise de Marteuils boudoir. I 
could not help but look at myself 
in any one of the mirrors in the 
store. I looked like the sort of 
hoodlum who would spend a day 
looking for weird underwear. 
Beaten up leather jacket, paintstained jeans and a white T-shirt. 
In addition, I smelled. After all, I 
had just effected a daring get
away from that MENS store in 
Oakland. Normally, I would not 
be so self conscious, except for the 
fact that the pot-pourri scent 
which permeated the store did 
not extend to my person. To make 
matters worse, it was Friday the 
thirteenth as well as Good Fri
day. Not only did I feel perverse 
and inadequate, I also felt pagan 
and blasphemous.
In essence, I was an island of 
foulness in a place named after 
Englands strictest woman. Be
fore I knew it, there she was, 
standing before me. Victoria her
self. It was a hallucination, of 
course, but in my tired and blurred 
mind I saw a scowling creature in 
a black dress and a jeweled crown.
I think she was saying, We are 
not amused.
I rubbed my eyes and she was 
replaced by a much too welldressed sales person. She was
meant we are not amused.
No, no, you cant help me, Im 
sorry, Im really sorry, I am a fly 
in this windshield, Im goingnow, 
really, I didnt mean it...
I ran.
A day later I returned, resolved 
to redeem myself in the eyes of 
the world. I was now wearing a 
long coat, dark pants, tie, loafers 
and sunglasses. I stopped before 
opening the door to the store and 
took off my coat, which I then 
draped over my shoulders. I 
pushed the door open. The woman 
walked up to me and said Can I 
help you?
I turned to face her.
Bond, I said, James Bond. 
After this I was duly ignored.
I looked around. There were 
other men there, to be sure, but in 
truth, none of them would admit 
it. Every time I looked at any of 
them for affirmation they would 
plunge their vision into the near
est rack, then they would quickly 
turn their heads away in embar
rassment. The result was that 
those men who strayed from the 
boxer short section in the store 
had this look of studied distance 
about them, knowing full well that 
wherever they looked, everybody 
else would be perfectly aware of 
the mental picture they would be 
drawing. The only other places 
where I have encountered this 
look are slaughterhouses and 
theatres showingSaturday Night
Fever.
After a half an hour of wander
ing about the store, trying des
perately to remember sizes, 
lengths, color preferences, fabric 
preferences and of course, the 
kink factor (this is the variable 
in the equation with which yousolve for the probability between 
gratitude and slap on the face),"I 
found myself thinking that if all 
of the leaders of the world had to; 
attend summit meetings in; 
Victorias Secret stores, the world I 
would be a much more interest-' 
ing place.
Dont ask me why.
There were some rough spots, j 
My getting entangled in a pair of | 
silk teddies (hanging silk things | 
on those puffy hangers can be; 
hell) was one of them, trying 01 
casually read through the catalog \ 
(without the obligatory OH MY> 
GOD HOW DID SHE GET INTO; 
THAT?!?) while the salesperson; 
rang up my purchase was an-; 
other. Nevertheless, I managed; 
to exit the store with that rem airi-1 
ing grain of dignity intact. That,! 
and perhaps the most conserva- f 
tive garment in the store.
Mathematics never was my; 
strong suit.

I LLA persons opinion
V. Generally, Student Senate 
elections tend to have low turn
outs. Usually the same number 
of people show up atAB Dances 
as vote for their senators. 
rLast April was of the biggest 
jturnouts ever for an election. 
Over 28 percent of the student 
Jbody came out and voted for the 
.student government president 
This fact may have been afi (fected by the issue of whether or 
not Greeks should get a 37 per
cent Activities Fee kickback 
rjwhich was to be on last years 
"ballot.
The year before only 14.1 perJ cent of the students voted.
-Why don't students vote for 
their senators? Do they learn 
this from their parents, who 
dont vote in national elections? 
We went out and asked sevI eral people whether or not they 
voted and why.IV
Cecil Huang 
Junior, CIT
Yes, Im going to vote. I vote 
every year. Its just something 
that goes on. I think I should have 
a say in who gets elected even if 
Im just a small student on this 
campus.
Elizabeth Stuetz 
Junior, H&SS
Yes, I always do. I think its 
important for students to choose 
their own leaders if we want the 
campus to be run the way we 
want it.
Val Pushwa 
Junior, H&SS
I always have. I think that you 
should use your input in who you 
want your leaders to be. If you 
dont choose them, you have no 
right to criticize them.
Rick Golembiewski 
Sophomore, MCS
Yes, Pm going to vote. There 
have been a lot of problems re
cently with the budgets. I think 
that if we dont have people who 
are responsible in Student Sen
ate to allocate the budgets, then 
we could have some real prob
lems.

I usually dont pay much attention to the elections, so I" 1

SEMINAR: FETAL IDENTITY AND SOCIETY
Guest Speaker: Ivan M. Naumov, M.D.
Research Associate 
Center for Biotechnology and Bioengineering 
University of Pittsburgh
The recent advances in the field of reproductive biomedical sciences have triggered an enormous 
scientific and general public interest directed towards the new modes to alleviate infertility, 
decrease fetal mortality and morbidity, and prevent genetic diseases. At the same time, the 
status of the unborn, the chief object of the new therapeutic modalities, has become a focal point 
in many polarized discussions within different strata of society.
While the identity of the fetus and its impact on our lives is being intensively (re-)examined from 
a medical, legal, philosophical and public policy making perspective, the scientific community is 
about to generate new powerful genetic techniques which if unleashed" could lead to 
unforeseeable brave new world scenarios. For example, gene therapy, fetal tissue transplantation, 
cloning and creation of chimeric interspecies, could soon become an everyday reality.
Is our society with its existing policies ready to meet the challenges of the new genetics"? Do 
we need to change our views and definitions of the nature of the unborn, its identity and (the 
debated) personhood? How do we treat embryos and fetuses, and parts thereof, when decisions 
about them are required? How could the application of the new scientific advances affect the 
future of our species?
These are some of the issues that are going to be addressed In the seminar by Dr. I. Naumov, 
biomedical researcher and co-author of the forthcoming book New Harvest: Transplanting Body 
Parts and The Reaping of Benefits" (Humana Press).

Editors Note: Pennsylvania Bill is a 
fictional beer connoisseur travelling 
around the world reviewing beers from, 
parious countries.
1 My name is Kevin Bernstein, the 
famous reporter who broke the interna
tional Beergate scandal.
: What Im about to tell you is the story 
of how Pennsylvania Bill and I teamed 
up to look for The White Burger.
; _This is the original transcript from my 
. journal. Not one word has been omitted.
;5:07 am. My alarm clock goes off and it 
ir&kes me up. Imagine that. I struggle 
out of bed and stumble into the shower. 
Sty faithful dog, Heel, is asleep in the 
, Sower stall. I wake him up and tell him 
ttrmake breakfast. He wanders off into 
the kitchen and starts cooking. I take my 
s Tower. Real hot water, hotter than a fat 
(hicks thighs on a summer day. Today is 
the big day. The day when I interview 
. the one and only Pennsylvania Bill.
: 5:35 am. I stumble into the kitchen, 
heel has already started eating. Whealies with milk, toast, a piece of orange, a 
fish garnished with parsley, and chocojate mousse. Me? I had the usual. A 
. iftttle of Czechoslovakian beer and some 
fcffild french fries.
(28:52 am. I arrive at work. Where the 
iiell have I been for the last three hours? 
i really cant remember. Why the hell did 
i-get up at 5:00 in the morning? I really 
fgildnt tell you that either. I grab my 
tape recorder and my notepad andl head 
off to a local pub where Im going to meet 
PA Bill. The Washington Sun will never 
get a better interview.
i 0:18 am. I walk into the bar where PA 
6ill is. I meet the bartender who walks 
; me over to PAs table. He introduces me\ OJthe reporter from the Sun. PA Bill 
greets me, Youre kind of pale for being 
fjpm the Sun. He pauses as I shake my 
h\ead. Long trip, huh? We sit down and
this one dude who channeled the spirit of 
The White Burger.
5:00 pm. PABill gets real excited about 
my story of the channeler. I decide that 
maybe if we teamed up, together we 
could find the White Burger. PA Bill 
would fulfill his grandfathers quest and 
I would get a hell of a front page story.
6:28 pm. We arrive back at my place. I 
pack a few bags and explain to Heel that 
were going to Cleveland, the land of 
broken promises and hard-boiled eggs. 
Heel packs his bags and we all get on a 
Greyhound bus to Cleveland.
The next day at 4:32 am. Were on the 
bus when gunfire erupts. Heel barks as 
the bullets shatter the windows near our 
seats. PA Bill jumps out of a shattered 
window and falls onto the ground, bruis
ing his ankle. Heel jumps out the front 
window in an explosive rainfall of small 
particles of glass. I followed Heel, hitting 
my head on the top of the bus on my way 
out. PA Bill had gotten back up and was 
running towards the gunfire. He tripped 
and fell into one of the gunmen. Heel 
found the other three and he took them 
out. So, we had these four gunmen, who 
were firing at a Greyhound bus. An ev
eryday event, youd think. We think not, 
as we usually do. The gunmen had tat
toos of spatulas on their foreheads. They 
were the Secret Organization headed by 
Ponch DiWeasel. They were bad news. 
They were definitely after the White 
Burger, so that6 they could use the 
Burgers power for something evil. What 
was their next move? We could only wait.
This feature is provided as a service to 
those members of the campus community 
who are of legal drinking age and enjoy 
drinking beers in a responsible fashion.

junior professional writing major who is 
taller than Calendar Editor William 
Burky, a junior computer engineering 
major.
A night of Indian culture...
order some beers. Not just any beer, but 
Pilsner Urquell. I pop the top and take a 
swig. Definitely not your normal every
day Czechoslovakian Pilsner.
Do you like the beer? PA Bill finishes 
off his and orders another.
Its OK. Smells like beer, I replied, 
turning on the tape recorder.
Personally, I think its rank, nasty 
and it has an aftertaste of dead, rotting 
hamsters.
So, why do you drink it? I queried. I 
love that word. Queried is one of those 
words that just makes a reporter start 
tingling all over.
Its beer. And Im a beer reviewer, so 
I have to drink it, he answered as he 
downed his second.
But, if you dont like it, why are you 
pounding them?
One of my philosophies is If you can 
get another beer, you need another beer. 
I drink by that slogan.
But why are you drinking beers that 
you dont like? I requeried. My skin was 
titillated by my writing. Titillates is 
another one of those tingling-reporter 
words.
Good point. Hey, bartender, bring me 
and my friend a Dos Equis. One of the 
best beers that Ive ever reviewed.
4:59 pm. PA Bill had just finished 
recounting his adventures of chasing 
down the White Burger. I told him about 
this article that I had written for a small 
town paper on channelers. There was

The fun never stops at Carnival
This is the second year that the la
ser show will be showing and this 
year; if the weather permits, it will 
be shown outdoors on the Mall at 
9:30 pm on Friday.
By DEXTER T. KOBAYASHI
Tartan Asst. Features Editor
When most people think
......about Spring Carnival, images
of the booths, the bands, the 
; buggy races, and the Scotch n
; Soda production come to mind.
; Is there more to Carnival? Yes!
; Carnival is filled with enough 
.activities to occupy every 
moment ofthe weekend extraveganza.
What carnival would be wor
thy of the name if not for its 
rides? The same rides from last 
year will be offered again this 
year by J&J Amusments. Tick
ets will be available for presale 
at the Skibo Info Desk from 9 
am to 5 pm until Wednesday. 
On Thursday, advance tickets 
will be available from 9 am to 
noon.
After that, they will be sold at 
the price of 30? each near the 
rides on Midway which is lo! cated on the Skibo parking lot. 
Tickets for the childrens rides 
will be on sale in the Warner 
Hall parking lot. Ticket sellers 
are still needed. If you are in, terested,callRidesChairFrank 
DiVito at x2119.
The rides will be started after 
opening ceremonies. This year, 
the opening ceremonies feature 
four companions of Dave 
Lamont who will dive out of an 
airplane from 4000 feet in the 
air. Dave Lamont is an adjunct 
professor in GSIA and is also a 
skydiver, but could not jump 
due to technicalities. The four 
divers will land at 5 pm on the 
Cut between Warner Hall and 
the Skibo parking lot. Lamont 
will be on the ground setting up 
the landing sites and will talk 
about what the divers will be 
doing.
A returning attraction will be 
the laser show. Last year the gym 
was packed with people watching 
the show. This is the second year 
that the laser show will be show
ing and this year, if the weather 
permits, it will be shown outdoors 
on the Mall at 9:30 pm on Friday. 
In the event of rain, the show will 
take place in the gym.
If the weather continues to be 
good on Saturday, hot air balloon 
rides will be offered from 2 pm to
5 pm. The balloon rides are paid 
for by the student activities fee. 
The balloon will go up by Warner 
Hall to a height of 75 feet giving 
each rider a birds-eye view of the 
campus.
Two charity events will be held 
over Spring Carnival to benefit 
Childrens Hospital of Pittsburgh. 
The first one is the Charity Eat-athon, organized by Delta Delta 
Delta and Navy ROTC. Teams 
and individuals will compete for 
cash and various other prizes 
donated by local businesses. The 
object is to eat Jello in the short
est amount of time. The second 
event will be Charitable Chairs, 
organized by A Phi O. This will be 
the sixth year in which the giant 
musical chairs game is played at 
Carnival.
Student Environmental Action 
Coalition (SEAC) members will 
present a house made out of alu
minum cans as part ofEarth Day. 
Inside the structure will be dis
plays about the environment. 
On Earth Day, the Sunday of 
Carnival, SEAC will take the 
fortress down to Point Park, 
Pittsburghs Earth Day center.
Two comedians, Michael 
Spiro and Henry Cho, will be 
performing during Carnival. 
Spiro is a folk singer who used 
to perform every year during 
Freshman Orientation and 
Carnival. He is returning after 
a two year break from CMU.
Cho has been on various TV 
programs, but will be perform
ing at CMU for the first time in 
the AB Coffeehouse. What 
makes him unique is the fact 
that he is an Asian comedian 
with a southern accent. Spiro 
will perform from 2:30 to 4 pm 
on Friday and Cho will be per
forming at 8 pm Saturday. Both 
comedians are performinginthe 
Tent and the shows are free to 
the public.
Along with these activities are 
the regular weekend AB and 
SDC movies, a recording booth, 
the annual Arts & Crafts Fair, 
an AB Swing Dance, an exhibi
tion by the CMU Navy ROTC 
Drill Team, and the AB concert 
featuring Oingo Boingo.
A complete schedule of Carni
val events can be picked up at 
the Skibo Information Desk or 
at the sales tables, which will be 
outside Skibo.

Anyone can write Dickens
Charles Dickens was one of 
Englands premiere authors ofthe 
19th century. His works were 
remarkable because of their in
sights into the lives of working 
class Londoners, their colorful 
characters and settings, and, 
above all, their impressive length.
One ofthe few faults people can 
find with Dickens is that he has 
been dead for several years, and 
has not been writing as many 
books as he used to. I say it is up to 
Dickens loyal followers to carry 
on, in our writing, the most time 
honored traditions ofthe Dicken
sian novel. I am talking, of course, 
about the convoluted plot-lines, 
mind-numbing redundancies, 
and incredible coincidences which 
have made Dickens famous. Here 
then is my own humble model of 
how to write like Dickens.
The Injustices Of Youth
Chapter 1: Mit Meets a Stranger
Ever since I can remember, I 
have been called Mit, possibly 
because that was my given name. 
I was called Mit, by my friends, 
because I enjoyed their company 
and would say to them, Please 
call me Mit, and by my enemies, 
because they knew my name.
I have always found that one of 
the injustices of youth [Note: its 
always best to establish the rele
vance of your title early on in the 
story, or else people wont remem
ber what its called] is that people 
must be called by the names which 
are given to them, even by their 
enemies. I remember, as a child, 
being young and foolish and say
ing, Why must I be called Mit by 
my enemies, whom I dont really 
like? Now of course, it is differ
ent, I know more than I did then, 
and, in the process, have become 
more learned. Now I am free of 
the child-like innocence of youth 
and people call me many names.
JASON SPEAKS
by Jason Lee Smith
People call me names such as 
Harold, and Irving, and Bill, but 
when they do, they are invariably 
speaking to someone else, so I 
rarely answer.
I lived with my parents, who 
were, oddly enough, my parents 
[Note: it is best to put in a few 
lines which are mildly amusing. 
If you can get a laugh amidst your 
anguished recitation on the pains 
of growing up, invariably the topic 
of all Dickens novels, you will be 
thought a wit]. My mother died of 
consumption while giving birth 
to me [Note: no matter how many 
women are introduced into Dick
ens novels, there is at least one 
who has died of either child-birth 
or consumption; it is one of the 
reasons his books are so popular. 
Ive guaranteed myself a real 
humdinger of a novel by combin
ing the two deaths]. My father 
was a quiet, brooding man with 
whom I had trouble communicat
ing, although we talked fre
quently. He had never truly got
ten over the death of my mother. 
I think in his own way, he blamed 
me for the death of his wife, who 
was also, at the time, my mother, 
although he carefully hid his feel
ings  they only manifested 
themselves in the frequent, vio
lent whippings which he would 
often give me [Note: like death by 
consumption, frequent violent 
whippings are another manda
tory feature of any Dickens novel. 
What a fun time they must have
had back then].
When I was older, but not as old 
as I was later to become, my fa
ther took to drinking, and then to 
eating. Finally his frivolous hab
its forced us into poverty. Seeing 
our economic plight, my cousin 
Rebecca took us in. She was a ! 
beautiful young woman, twice nty 
age, but only five years older than 
me. She became my sister, and 
friend, all at once, in addition to 
becoming the mother figure which t 
I never had. It wasnt long before 
I fell deeply in love with her [Note: 
Oedipus complexes sell].
At this time, my father began to 
grow senile, and took to carrying 
around large otters wherever he 
went. In my youthful naivete,'. I 
called them ermines. I often re
flect that one of the injustices of 
youth is that a boy cannot call 
otters, ermines, if he wishes, but
I think that this is only one of the 
evils which England has to face in 
this industrial age. [Note: it is;a 
well-known fact that Dickens hsid 
a terror of machinery which bor
dered on intense paranoia, arid 
he spent many, many pages so
liloquizing on the evils of the 
industrial age.]
With father gone, Rebecca and
I were left alone in our large, 
musty house, by ourselves. Al
though we were dirt poor, had no 
food, and frequently were takEN 
sick, it was a good time for us, for 
although we were alone, by our
selves, we were also together.
One day Rebecca got a letter....
To complete this novel, repeat 
this page a minimum of700 times, 
or until your reader has had a 
stroke. By experience I have found 
that this latter event occurs far 
more frequently.

Spirit hopes to win for the fourth straight year. Sting, the above buggy, 
retired after last years races.
By DANIEL DE GRANPRE
Tartan Staffwriter
After several weeks of inter
mittent rain and exhaustive test
ing, everybody is ready to put it 
on the line and see if Spirit can 
repeat as Sweepstakes winner 
for the fourth time in a row.
This Friday will be the 66th 
' Carnegie Mellon Buggy Competi
tion, and things are looking tight; 
Buggy 1990 will be one of the 
most competitive in CMUs his
tory.
Its anybodys victory, said
* Spirit Buggy Chairman Terrance 
Yarde. Theres no clear-cut 
leader.
Were the only team that can 
beat Spirit, declared Beta Theta 
Pi Buggy Chairman Paul Brownling.
Were gonna give Spirit and 
Beta a run for their money this 
year, promised Pi Kappa Alpha 
Buggy Chairman Dan Hushon.
We expect to finish in the top
I1 three, proclaimed Sigma Nu 
Buggy Chairman James Shaw.
The biggest issue for Buggy 
1990 is safety. Rain has reduced 
the number of freerolls this year, 
and many competitors are wor} l ied that due to lack of experience 
someones buggy will crash.
The top four picks for this years
sweepstakesSpirit, Beta, Pika, 
and Sigma Nuare all previewed 
in this article. Also previewed are 
several other competitors who 
may finish in the top ten, and 
SAEs Limo, which may finish 
dead last.
Spirit
Spirit has achieved a great deal 
of attention by sweeping buggy 
the last three years. Three victo
ries is not by any means the great
est buggy dynasty in CMU his
tory, although it is the best record 
ever for a non-fraternity competi
tor; ATO won buggy nine times 
out of ten in the fifties and early
sixties.
However, Spirit will be going 
for its fourth consecutive victory, 
and no one has had four victories 
in a row since ATOs six-year 
stretch from 1953 to 1958.
Spirit Buggy Chair Terrence 
Yarde attributed the recent Spirit 
success to several factors. We 
started out as underdogs, he said, 
and we had to prove something. 
But most of it was just a lot of 
hard work.
Yarde acknowledged, also, that 
there was a lot of pressure to keep 
up a winning tradition. That is, 
if you can call three years a win
ning tradition, he said.
During Saturday mornings
push practice, Spirit looked in
credibly strong. The groups push
ers ran effortlessly up Hill 1 and 
their veteran buggies were as solid 
as ever.
However, the newest Spirit 
buggy spun out during a pass 
test, causing a stir among the 
dozens gathered for the practice 
event.
Yarde was nonplussed, how
ever. Im confident that our new 
buggy will run next Friday, he 
said.
Yarde could not identify a single 
clear-cut favorite in the races. Its 
up in the air, he said. The big 
contenders are Sigma Nu, Pika, 
Beta, and us, but its anybodys 
victory. Because of the weather, 
were not really sure of what our 
buggies can do.
After Saturdays practice, the 
confidence of the Spirit team has 
ebbed. In light of seeing the 
competition, said Yarde, [our 
confidence! is not nearly as high 
as it used to be.
Unlike Beta, Spirit has not lost 
any members of its mens push 
team because of a track event. 
However, the push team is still a 
concern of Yarde. This year, our 
organization is a lot better, he 
said. We have a good number of 
veterans coming back, along with 
impressive new pushers. How
ever, we dont have the depth on 
pushing like we did last year. I 
start to wonder if the winning 
tradition has made us overconfi
dent.
Yarde is concerned over the loss 
of freerolls due to inclement 
weather and the effects upon 
driver experience and safety. I 
have a lot of concerns; it applies to 
us and a lot of other teams, ex
pressed Yarde. I have a bad feel
ing that the lack of rolls will cause 
a lot of problems. However, Yarde 
is not worried about the heats his 
teams are competing in. I dont 
know a lot about Phi Kap driv
ers, said Yarde, but Fringe is 
very good. The majority of organi
zations have only gone down once 
or twice at high speeds.
Spirits buggies include Quan
tum Leap (87), Tachyon (89), 
Genesis (86) and Viscious Flow 
(90).
Beta
Spirit is the odds-on favorite, 
the reigning champion, and the 
team to beat. Or at least, thats 
what everybody tells Beta Theta 
Pis Paul Browning, and thats 
what he would like to end this 
year.
Browning, the Beta buggy chair, 
is confident with his team. Were 
looking pretty good, he said. We
definitely have a better team than 
last year.
Browning thinks that Betas 
chances to defeat the Spirit buggy 
team are better than anyones. I 
definitely think that were the 
only team that can beat Spirit, 
he said. Spirits buggies arent 
on the same level as Pikas, Sigma 
Nus, and ours. Theyve been 
winning with a great push team. 
But this year, the gap between 
the push teams has narrowed and 
the gap between the buggies has 
widened.
However, Browning believes the 
safe money is still on Spirit, just 
barely. Id want 3:2 odds if I was 
betting against Spirit.
Beta has experienced a pushteam problem from a track event 
occurring this weekend; some of 
Betas best pushers will not-be 
able to compete in buggy. Our 
push team is not as strong as- it 
could be because of the trgck 
team, commented BrowniHg, 
but we dont encourage quitting 
a varsity team to push buggy. 
Browning does not believe that 
competition from the rest of the 
organizations should concern 
Beta. Besides Spirit, the only 
team I see a chance of beating us 
is Pika, but I dont anticipate 
having any trouble with them/

Push Practice: Nighttime practice for pushers during the 
week. Tech and Frew are closed off from midnight to 6 am, and 
while most teams practice from midnight to about 2 am, some 
come out later and stay later.
' Freerolls: Training time on the whole course. From 6 to 9 am 
on Saturday and Sunday mornings, the race course is closed off 
and the organizations come out to test and improve buggy design 
.as well as pusher performance.
- Cape Test: Capability Test, a brake and vision test that each 
driver must pass in each buggy that he or she will drive. In order 
to pass, the buggy must be going 15 miles per hour and be able to 
stop within 40 feet. Additionally, the driver must be able to see 
clearly in a 45 arc from center.
Pass Test: Passing test, where a driver must safely pass a 
slower moving buggy. Completed during freerolls, a driver must 
be pass tested in every buggy that he or she will drive on race day.
Drop Test: A test preformed the morning of free-rolls and after 
! each heat on race day. It is basically another brake test where the 
driver rolls down the sidewalk in front of the gym, and has to 
brake to a stop within 15 feet.
DQ: Disqualification. There are any number of infractions of 
the rules that will cause a buggy to be DQd, but the some of the 
: more common ways are failing to pass the drop test or the pusher 
not having his or her hand on the pushbar as the buggy crosses 
the finish line.
Windows: The number of Windows that a buggy passes is a 
gauge of its performance. Coming out of the Chute at the bottom 
of freerolls, the buggies roll-out up Hill 3 along a portion of 
; Porter Hall that has nine windows. The more windows a buggy 
can roll, the faster it can roll, and hence the better the perform
ance.

NJ, ' Taking a camera onto the buggy course
during push practice or freerolls can be an 
effective open invitation for obscene hand 
motions, verbal abuse, and even threats 
to your person and your equipment.
So I was quite surprised when I got 
clearance to do a photo story on Fringe, 
one of four independent buggy organiza
tions funded by the Activities Fee. Com
posed of about 70 members, the bootfaand-buggy group boasts four mens a&d 
three womens buggy teams and thifee 
buggies: Junior, Lunatic, and Barrier.

program was extensive, it wasnt unreThomas Nichols/1 artan Photo Lditor stricted. I wasnt allowed to take pictures

Although Sweepstakes is a tradition older than the Senior 
Fence, many people who are not involved with a buggy program 
have no idea what its all about. Just trying to figure out whats 
happening on race day can be impossible when all sorts of lingolaced exchanges between team members or radio announcers is 
all you hafre to go on.
So, in the noble cause of eliminating Sweepstakes ingnorance, 
here is the Tartan Beginners Guide to Buggy. While by no means 
exhaustive, it should get any buggy novice off the starting line 
and rolling up Hill 1.
I
Sweepstakes, Buggy Races: Theyre one and the same. The 
official naiAe of the whole event is Sweepstakes, and but it is 
usually ref4red to as buggy. Sweepstakes also refers to the 
committee that officiates and coordinates the buggy races. This 
committee includes a Safety Chairman, responsible for enforcing 
ihe various ^afety regulations contained in the hundred-page 
nile book kept up to date by an Alumni Safety Committee which 
works to make buggy safe as possible.
; Hill: Looking at the course in normal terms you might count 3 
hills, one up Tech Street, one down the back stretch, and one up 
frew, but under the definitions of Sweepstakes, a hill is more 
than a sloping road. Formally, a hill is a upward-sloping length 
Of the course for which a buggy is pushed by one pusher. Consecu
tive hills are separated by 15-yard neutral zones where one 
pusher takes tfver for another. There are five hills in all, with the 
Hills 2 and""3 separated by a long downhill portion known as 
freeroll.

Beta will be demonstrating a 
new technology at freerolls, but 
Browning would not comment on 
what the technology would do.
Browning does not think that 
the lack of freerolls will affect his 
team. Our A and B drivers have 
a lot of experience, he remarked, 
and theyre the ones who will be 
going fast. With the current safety 
rules, our buggies are safe; if it 
comes down to a wreck, I have no 
doubt that our drivers would come 
out okay.
Betas last buggy win was in 
1979.
Betas buggies include Mercury 
(89), Challenger (86, rebuilt 87), 
and Xavier (87). The new Beta 
buggy was unnamed at press time.
Pika
Pika is looking for an upset over 
both Spirit and Beta. Dan 
Hushon, co-chairman of Pikas 
buggy program, predicted that 
Pika would land at least two 
buggies in the top ten, and also 
foresaw Spirit and Beta having a 
lot to worry about.
Hushon described the confi
dence level of the Pika team as
high. Our own push teams strong 
... at least as strongaslast years, 
he said.
For this years races, Pika has 
built two new buggies, tentatively 
titled Race Day 1 and .Race Day 2. 
Hushon was confident that both 
buggies will qualify, despite the 
lack of freerolls this year. We 
have three veteran drivers return
ing, he said. Well have enough 
rolls in.
Hushon was unsure of how Pika 
would finalize its racing teams. I 
dont know what buggies well 
race, he said.
Hushon doubted that Pika 
would suffer any major safety 
problems on raceday, despite the 
lackoffreerolls. Ourdrivers wont 
go faster than I think they can, 
asserted Hushon. Weve had no 
technical problems, and experi
ence breeds perfection.
However, Hushon was worried 
about the experience of other 
competitors. We are most defi
nitely worried, said Hushon. 
There are three or four fraterni
ties that arent as experienced as 
we are. Pm not worried about 
anyone in our heat, but weve 
steered clear of Phi Kap because 
theyve had steering problems.
Pikas last buggy win was in 
1986.
Pikas other buggies include 
Breathless (84) and Predator (88), 
the third and fourth place finish
ers of 1989. Pika will also run 
King Solomon (86) in the races.
Sigma Nu
For Buggy 1990, the Zoo has 
built a new animal. Jama, Sigma 
Nus latest buggy, is an excellent 
piece of machinery, according to 
James Shaw, the SigmaNu buggy 
chair.
But, Jama had problems in last 
Saturdays free rolls. It crashed 
right after it got out of the chute, 
Shaw admitted. But when it 
crashed, it was going really fast. 
Its going to be fixed and will be 
out soon.
Shaw believes that the compe
tition will be extremely tough. 
Buggys gonna be really close, 
said Shaw, especially between 
the top four or five teams. But I 
expect to finish in the top three.
Shaw could not gauge the confi
dence level of his team. Our push 
team isnt as great as I want it to 
be, but its okay, he said. How
ever, the Sigma Nu buggies are as
I noticed that this year people didn't 
go as fast as usual during free rolls. 
There probably will be wrecks on race 
day.
 James Shaw, 
Sigma Nu Buggy Chair
good as ever. Theyre in great 
shape, he remarked.
The lack of free rolls hasnt had 
a significant effect on Sigma Nus 
team. I think our drivers are 
good, noted Shaw. I noticed that 
this year people didnt go as fast 
as usual during free rolls. There 
probably will be wrecks on race 
day.
Sigma Nus last buggy win was 
in 1985.
In addition to Jama, Sigma Nus 
buggies include Jerboa (86), 
Lemur (82), Calugo (84), saAThe 
Pope (87).
Theta Xi
Theta Xi might be this years 
biggest surprise. Running four
buggies, including a new one, 
Theta Xi could place in the top 
ten.

dicted that both theAandBteams 
will make the finals. This year, 
mens B is much faster, he main
tained.
Last year, Theta Xis A Team 
did not finish, but Braho believes 
that they will place this year. As 
far as a time or place, I can say in 
the top six, Braho offered. Its 
real hard to guess.
DSilver Yeti, Theta Xis new 
buggy for 1990, was described by 
Braho as quite interesting look
ing. Braho said that the wide 
rear end of the buggy makes it 
look like a snowblower and space 
shuttle combined.
Theta Xi has never won buggy.
Theta Xis buggies includeLittle 
Nip (84), Nemesis (87), Valkure 
(87), Caesar (88), and DSilver 
Yeti (90).
SAE
SAE isnt exactly hoping to 
frighten Spirit with Limo this 
year.
Limo is perennially the worst 
buggy in the entire competition, 
with times exceeding the sixminute mark. Eric Gropp, SAE 
buggy chair, said that Limo (76) 
almost did not pass the safety 
test, but SAEs mechanics solved 
the problem by nailing a trash 
can lid on Limos roof. Gropp said 
the buggy will be pushed by sen
iors only, and that they will proba
bly be drunk.
Gropp also mentioned that SAE 
will be running a serious buggy 
this year, too. Quasimodo 089), 
while notatopten contender, will 
be driven this Friday.
SAEs new 1990 buggy will not 
pass the required tests, but it 
should be a challenger next year. 
However, history is not in SAEs 
favor; the house hasnt won buggy 
since 1922.
Compubookie predicts that Spirit will make it four years in a row
Editors Note: Compubookie is 
the mysterious gnome who lives 
beneath Panther Hollow Bridge 
(or at Panther Hollow Inn) and 
makes the yearly buggy predic
tions. Not even we know 
Compubookies true identity !
Last years perfect racing con
ditions did not yield a new record, 
contrary to my predictions. Still, 
Spirit won by a significant mar
gin.
With three veteran pushers 
returning, I predict that Spirit 
will win its fourth consecutive 
year, their Dynasty. Beta, a 
strong contender, has put out a 
new buggy, sure to be faster than 
last years second place Mercury. 
Similarly, PiKA has put out two 
new buggies this spring, one of 
which seems to be a large step 
from Pikas traditional designs.
Could these organizations be 
competitive? Maybe, but the push
ers will make all the difference. 
Beta has may good athletes and 
could field a fast push team, but 
Pikas push team members are 
living in the past, and I dont see 
them beating Spirit.
Another departure from the 
traditional 3-wheeled buggy 
comes from Sigma Nu, who placed 
two wheels up front and one in 
the back. Again, if Sigma Nu rolls
Tartan File Photo 
Compubookie in all his splendor.
like it used to and rents some 
pushers, they could win.
There is an onslaught of new 
buggies this spring from organi
zations such as Spirit, Beta, PiKA, 
Sigma Nu, DTD, Theta Xi, Fringe 
and others. These new buggies 
should prove to be lighter and roll 
faster than their predecessors. 
The most popular design has to 
belong to Spirit, with imitations 
from Phi Kap and SDC. Spirits 
new buggy is rumored to weigh 16 
lbs without hardware, which 
should make it the lightest on the 
hill.
The womens heats were excit
ing last year, with back to back 
records by PiKA and then Spirit, 
who won. With strong push teams
for both organizations, its sure to 
be close, but I dont think were on 
course to set a new record.
The groundhog was most cer
tainly wrong this year, as winter 
has stayed for the past nine weeks, 
bringing with it unseasonable and 
unwelcome rain and snowstorms. 
With only four spring freerolls 
thus far, organizations that get 
too greedy for speed (tradition
ally Theta Xi, DTD and Phi Kap) 
are sure to be going head to head 
with the haybales.
It will certainly be an exciting 
year for Sweepstakes. New bug
gies and new records? Come out 
and see adrenaline, speed, and 
without a doubt, a lot of wrecks.

the basement of Margaret Mor
rison. Buggy Chair Dave Hen
derson, a fifth-year history ma
jor, was afraid that photos taken 
j in the buggy room might include 
' materials hanging on the walls 
and other equipment lying in 
the background that could give 
:rucial hints about Fringes bug
gies to competitors.
The excitement of buggy se
crecy and the adrenalin of race 
day are balanced by equal bore
dom on the course.
As race day approaches, the 
course gets busy. A buggy team 
will be lucky to get three prac
tice runs for each pusher during 
one two-hour session. Although
the course is open for push prac
tice from midnight to 6 am, 
Fringe worked only until 2 am 
at the push practices I saw.
For freerolls, a lot of prepara
tion goes into just making the 
course ready for rolls. Larger 
organizations are required to 
provide a certain number of 
sweepers and flaggers. The
exciting
former sweep the course to elimi
nate debris, while the latter 
guard the course from traffic.
Instead of sweeping and flag
ging, Fringe members sawdust 
the course to absorb oil well 
before the sweepers go to work. 
The smaller groups, said Hen
derson, simply dont have the 
members to coverthe other jobs.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  17 April 1990
Womens buggy will have fierce 
competition for its eleventh year
By KARYN SILVA
Tartan Contributing Editor
Buggy, the unique sport that 
dominates the activity and sleep
ing patterns of Carnegie Mellon 
students each spring, is well un
der way. In three days the gun will 
go off marking the first heat of 
Sweepstakes, and competing in 
that first heat will be three teams 
of women.
Womens buggy is now in its 
eleventh year. Starting in 1979, 
there were four teams competing. 
That year CIA won with a time of 
3:04.7.
Since then, as buggy has pro
gressed to new heights, so has 
womens involvement. There are 
women chairmen, drivers, me
chanics, and pushers.
In the 1989 Sweepstakes, the 
Spirit women won with a time of 
2:35.651.
At this point the 1990 Sweep
stakes is still a question: Who is 
the fastest? Who is pushing the 
best buggy? Will they break a 
record?
The questions will be answered 
in the womens preliminaries on 
Friday and in the finals on Satur
day. This year there are 24 
womens push squads scheduled 
to compete in eight heats of three. 
What that means is 120 women 
pushers, and the competition is 
on.
The competition involved in 
womens buggy tends to be differ
ent than that surrounding the men. 
To begin with, womens push 
squads are fielded from the inde
pendent organizations; as inde
pendent and little sister teams 
pushing for the fraternities; or as 
sororities pushing for the fraterni
ties.
This year four of the five sororiWomen's buggy is now in its eleventh 
year. Starting in 1979, there were 
four teams competing. That year CIA 
won with a time of 3:04.7. Since 
then, as buggy has progressed to new 
heights, so has womens involvement.
ties are providing fraternity push 
teams. Kappa Kappa Gamma is 
pushing for Kappa Delta Rho, 
Delta Delta Delta is pushing for 
Sigma Nu, Kappa Alpha Theta is 
pushing for Pi Kappa Alpha, and 
Delta Gamma is pushing for Beta 
Theta Pi.
Because of these arrangements 
and the fact that buggy tends to 
be male dominated, the women 
pushers agree that teams are 
more auxiliary to the buggy pro
grams.
Commented Debbie Anderson 
of Betas womens team, Women 
are extra, in addition to mens 
buggy, since we dont build our 
own.
The organizations have their 
mens team and then they have 
their womens teams also, agreed 
Spirits Ellen Barry.
There are also some factors that 
must be taken into account more 
by womens teams than by mens. 
These factors include the weight 
ofthe buggy and the buggys pushbar.
Phi Kap chair Ed Bockman said 
weight is definitely the most 
important factor affecting 
women. Women tend to be hin
dered by a heavier buggy more 
than the men.
A lighter buggy really makes a 
big difference with the women, 
said Barry.
The pushbar is also a factor. It 
is hard to push when the pushbar 
is up near your head on the hills, 
said Paula Madden of Phi Kaps 
team.
But this does not make the 
competition any less intense. 
There is more competition this 
year, said Bockman. Since a lot 
of organizations have new bug
gies this year, the women are 
getting last years top buggies. 
That means its not just the push 
squads anymore, there will be the 
roll-outs of the buggies too.
Womens buggy also tends to be 
in closer competition than the 
mens since the time spreads 
among the women are not as great.
Watch the women on race day. 
Ten organizations are fielding 
womens push squads, and some 
of these organizations are put
ting out both A and B teams. Last 
years winners, Spirit and Theta, 
will be striving for the top again 
to defend their positions, and 
there are many other teams that 
have been putting in the time 
during freerolls and push prac
tice to make a good showing on 
raceday. Were psyched, said Phi 
Kaps Madden.
Psyched sums up womens 
buggy well. The women are as de
voted as the men, and as Spirits 
winning 1989 time shows, some
times they are even better.Junior Dina Frederickson pushes the Phi Kap buggy up hill 5.

Tartan Staffwriter  Theatre Review -
THE HOUSE OF BERNARDA ALBA. The story of domestic conflict within the house 
of a repressive widow. Directed by Rina Yerushalmi. Starring Carey Cannon, Anne 
Marie Cummings, Sabrina Reeves, and Meianie Shulman. Currently running attjie 
Kresge Theatre until April 28. Showtimes are 8 pm Tuesdays through Saturdays with 
a matinee performance at 2 pm on Saturday. For ticket information call x2407.
The art of tragedy lies in counterbal
ancing misery with causality. Nobody 
likes a categorical condemnation of ex
istence as a brief spasm of pain that 
scoffs at humanitys futile attempts at 
heroism in the interim before death. A 
good drama will map out every step of 
its descent into catastrophe with the 
precision of an engineers schematic, 
leaving no mishap unexplained, writ
ing off no disaster as an inexplicable 
necessity of a chaotic and malevolent 
universe.
In short, the pithy appeal that life 
sucks is out. To be a tragic drama is to 
say life can suck, and to be ready to 
explain why.
The CMU Drama Departments lat
est effort of its 75th year is the produc
tion of Garcia Lorcas The House of 
Bernada Alba, a play that doesnt laz
ily blame suffering on life, nor portray 
misery as the hallmark of existence. 
Rather, this is a play about repression, 
the soul-sapping reduction of men 
or in this case, women  into lifeless 
husks, a horror that is portrayed not as 
cosmic inevitability, but as volitional 
evil.
Five miserable daughters whose only 
desperate hopes of happiness stem from 
the distant possibility of marriage, are 
trapped in a cage of solemn propriety 
and religious asceticism. Skulking 
house-servants double as gossips and 
spies. And Bernada Alba, a fierce widow 
obsessed with maintaining the reputa
tion of her home as a place of moral 
purity, even at the cost of wringing the 
life from her daughters, leaves behind 
only drained remnants.
This is not a play about joy, but the 
detailed condemnation of its opposite.
Life is portrayed as a default, not'an 
exception, and its extermination'as 
the result of years of deliberate mal
ice, not chance disaster. Through 
symbol after symbol, from a sm-all 
rocking horse upon which the daugh
ters sway autistically, to the brief glar
ing of a shooting star, to the crazed 
grandmother who raves of her faftthsies of marriage and a life by the sa, 
we see the necessary deliberate na
ture of evil, that the human mind 
must be forcibly locked up, stamped 
out, and crushed before it surrenders 
to stagnation.
And even so, humanitys vivid e3@rgies are not truly extinguished, ptit 
continued on page'lM.7
underwent the long process to 
become the finished work it is 
today, earlier drafts were per
formed at Grillo-Marxuachs high 
school.
Set sometime in the thirties, 
the story follows the adventures 
of screenwriter Perry Arnold 
(Mick Sutter) who, forced to 
change hiswriting style to fit the 
dramatic and predictable guide
lines of a team of movie execu
tives, goes to a cafe to think and 
winds up interacting with his own 
character creations, including the 
hero Teddy Potsdorf and his side
kick Pervis McAllister. The play 
stars Nick Harrigan as Teddy, 
Jennifer Adams as Pervis, David 
Gross as the devious Herbert East, 
and Jessica Bier as Eudora Melon.
Grillo-Marxuach wrote the fi
nal draft of Trapped in the Silver 
Screen over the summer and then 
entrusted his work to the capable 
hands of a group of musicians 
who filled in gaps left by GrilloMarxuach with musical numbers.
Jeff Muller, one of these musi
cians, explains. After Javi fin
ished the script, Jessie [Ramey] 
and I sat down and decided where 
the music would go and what kind 
of music we were looking for, and 
then we had three other people 
help us.
Remarkably, this caused little 
creative tension between GrilloMarxuach and the musicians. I 
was on another continent, I was 
doing a semester abroad ... and I 
know this sounds really granola 
but when I came back I thought 
that the music was so good that 
there really wasnt any tension, 
he says.

Walking into the ballroom right 
1 before a rehearsal of Scotch n
; Sodas Trapped in the Silver 
\ Screen is like happening upon a 
| puzzle in pieces on the floor.
At the back of the room, paint! ers listen to rock music from a 
! portable radio while hovering over 
' a strip of green canvas. A collec| tion of palm trees begins to mate; rialize out of the murky backj ground. In one corner of the room, 
I each orchestra member tunes an 
I instrument, filling the area with 
I their cacophony.
Director Nancy Gleason, stage 
! manager Liz Atkinson, and writer 
! Javier Grillo-Marxuach congrei gate on a platform in the middle 
; of the room to discuss the upcom| ing rehearsal. On the stage, the 
j actors begin to warm-up with a
few small exercises. Then they 
start moving about the stage in 
character, each seeming to be in 
his or her own world, repeating 
one line over and over again.
Eventually the pieces have to 
come together. The band mem
bers begin to take notice of each 
others presence and play as a 
group while the actors collect on 
each side of the stage for their 
entrance. The people on the plat
form start watching whats going 
on and occasionally make sugges
tions. The painters  well, they 
keep doing their own thing, but 
they turn their music off so the 
band can play without competi
tion. Anyway, you get the point.
Playwright Grillo-Marxuach, a 
juniorwriting major, has been 
working on this play, in one form 
or another, for six years. As 
Trapped in the Silver Screen
Director Nancy Gleason overlooks Friday's rehearsal. Teddy Potsdorf (Nick Harrigan) stifles his faithful
sidekick Pervis McAllister (Jennifer Adams).

Burn This heats up the 
Pittsburgh Public Theater
By CHRISTOPHER KUSH
Tartan Dossier Literary Editor
Burn This, the 1987-88 Broadway hit 
by Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright 
Lanford Wilson, receives its Pittsburgh 
Premiere at the Public Theater now 
through May 13.
~The play suffers from a split personal
ity. The first act is dynamite, riddled 
with engaging conflicts. Unfortunately, 
the second act abandons the issues that 
are raised earlier in the play for a con
ventional resolution that seems too easy 
.for the theater.
When the play starts, Robbie, a tal
ented would-be choreographer, and his 
lover, Dom, have been killed in a freak 
boating accident. His roommates, Anna, 
also a choreographer, and Larry, also 
;gay, are devastated. Burton, Annas lover 
and a successful screenwriter, shows up 
,to.share in the grief. Anna was the only 
.one invited to the funeral. Robbies fam-iTy knew nothing of his lifestyle.
-In about eight seconds I know they 
have no idea that Robbies gay.... Theyve 
never heard of Dom, Anna laments. It 
\vas all just so massively sad.... And they 
.never saw him dance! I just could not 
believe it.
A month later, things are further 
complicated when Pale, Robbies older 
brother, shows up to collects his belong
ings. Pale is an vexatious character who 
Jisplays a volatile paranoia that might 
stem from his ambiguous dealings with 
the mob and an awkward grief over his 
faggot brothers death. By the end of 
tfre first act, Anna finds herself sleeping 
with Pale, despite his general offensive
ness.
Then, of course, comes an intermis
 Theatre Review 
BURN THIS. The tale of a heated romance that develops between an unlikely duo. 
Directed by Lee Sankowich. Starring Helena Ruoti, David Butler, and Peter Webber.

sion, and you can pay 75 cents for an ittybitty Dixie cup of soda pop. The prices go 
up from there.
The second act seems to embrace a 
more conventional plot line. Anna finds 
herself longing for marriage, having to 
choose between safe, steady Burton and 
the more dangerous Pale. Anna decides 
to walk on the wild side, but she is no 
longer the self-sufficient woman from 
the first act. Her choice is that of a 
pseudo-liberated woman, a new-tradi
tionalist, a woman who chooses to fulfill 
the traditional roles that society has 
prescribed for her.
The tendency toward convention would 
not have been so disconcerting if the play 
had not shunned mediocrity within the 
drama.
Larry, who works in advertising, says, 
You have no notion of the stupidity 
involved in designing a Christmas card 
for a national company. Especially if its 
Chrysler. Just for starters, there are a 
hundred seventy religions in America 
and only one of them believes in Santa 
Claus. Nothing religious; that would 
offend non-believers. Reindeers are out
 Santa Claus again. No snow; that 
would offend California and Florida. No 
evergreens, holly, pines  out of the 
questionmistletoe, no bells. They said 
the only thing everyone believes in is the
family and children. I said that was going 
to offend homosexuals.... I said it as a 
joke; they bought it... Its going to be late, 
and the cost is astronomical, but we 
wont have offended anyone.
Burn This experiences that same phe
nomenon. The second act caters to tradi
tional notions of sexuality. Anna, who 
has previously fretted over having noth
ing to say through dance, constructs her 
first piece around Pale.
As Larry describes it, Its a man and a
 Its very startling. It just has to do 
with the center of gravity... I mean its a 
regular mandancing like a man dances
 in a bar or something, with this girl. 
Youve never seen anything like it.
The problem is that we have seen stuff 
like it. Everything is like it. We are 
drowning in messages about women 
being defined in terms of male affection.
Anna and Pale continue to elude each 
other until Larry, who must be able to 
sense true love  he certainly does not 
reveal any experience with affection in 
the play  brings them together before 
he fades from the action. Larry ends up 
being the emasculated homosexual, 
possessing neither his own sex drive nor 
a political awareness.
It seems pretentious for Larry to have 
previously denounced the mechanisms 
of pop culture when Broadway is just as

guilty of catering to dominant American 
values as the Chrysler Christmas Com
mittee. In the end, Burn This supplies 
only a teasing veneer of any real ques
tioning of values or investigation of life. 
This is the stuff hits are made of.
In the first act, Burton, the. screen
writer, says, There are no good movies 
... when a good movie happens, which it 
might, on a roll of the dice, once in five 
years, its like this total aberration, a 
freak of nature like the Grand Canyon,
theyre ashamed of it. They cant wait to 
remake it in another ten years and fuck 
it up the way its supposed to be. Movies 
are some bankers speculation about how 
American adolescents want to see them
selves that week. Period.
After watching Anna and Larry lose 
their identities, I wondered if anyone 
could say that Burn This was more than 
some bankers speculation about how 
the American middle-class want to see 
themselves that season. Period.
No more questions  The Question ends its 36 issue run
Whats the name of that emo3 fcion? When youre walking down 
the street and its gorgeous out-side and you see the Garden of 
E'den on the corner of a street. 
The sign turns to Dont Walk (of 
course!) and it seems kind of ironic 
i that sitting in the middle of all 
that beauty is a scruffy old man 
selling off bits of the Garden 
.wrapped in cellophane. And while 
youre waiting for the sign to turn 
to Walk, you look over there and 
\ wish to God that you had someone to buy flowers for. The sign 
changes color and you start walk
ing again, as the bitterness fades 
away like wet hair drying. Sniff.
If youre crossing Forbes from 
Morewood, theres this little pot' hole right next to the curb. On a
COMIC RELIEF
by Waseem Hussain
rainy day when youve got a lot of 
things on your mind, you stand 
too close to the curb and a car that 
could care less about what hap
pens to you drives by and splashes 
all the filth of the world onto your 
ankles. What kind of world would 
it be where every curb had a pot
hole, where every street comer
sold flowers, where you found 
yourself drowning in an ocean of 
desperation, impersonality, lone
liness, and filth? It would proba
bly be a place like Hub City.
Hub City is home to Victor Sage, 
otherwise known as The Ques
tion. Whats his gimmick? Does 
he fly? Is he a mutant? No, he just 
doesnt have a face. The Question 
was a deluxe format comic pub
lished for 36 issues which ended 
its glorious run a few weeks ago, 
bringing with it an end to the 
gripping tale of the degeneration 
of Hub City. Along the way the 
title revolved and developed a 
complex cast of characters and 
gave many a memorable story 
ranging from spiritual purity 
through the Heisenberg Uncer
tainty Principle to schizophrenia.
This title was truly a gem, and 
if youre ever in a comic store you 
should try to get back issues of it, 
because unlike most books, it 
maintained continuity without 
having to resort to multipart sto
ries. Each story was a piece of the 
puzzle, each issue posed a ques
tion and tried to answer it. I shed 
a tear for its passing. Ashes to 
ashes, dust to dust, pulp to pulp.
Can a man fight evil without 
becoming evil? It was this ques
tion that the title tried to answer 
as it closed out its run, and the 
answer to that question sets the 
stage for what should be a unique 
title that should be coming out in 
a few weeks called The Question 
Quarterly (48 pages, published
every three months). Those 36 is
sues (the 36th is still available) 
have secured a place in comic book 
history. Okay, eulogies over, back 
to the world of the living.
This week, look for the debut of 
Hawkworld #1. It picks up right 
off where the Hawkworld min
iseries ended and continues the 
story of the rebellious, honorable, 
cynical but naive idealist Katar 
Hoi, a.k.a. Hawkman, and his 
struggle to make the world a 
better place (sigh). The artwork is 
above average, but surprisingly, 
the tone of the book remains as 
intense as the miniseries. Other 
notable books are Digital Justice 
the first computer generated 
Batman graphic novel,X-Men, Dr. 
Fate, and an interestmgDaredevil
annual continuing the LifeForm 
storyline begun last week in the 
Punisher annual.
Finally, the book of the week is 
Legends of the Dark Knight #7, 
which features part two of the 
quirky, haunting Gothic sto
ryline. Its pretty scary and weird 
too. Weird? Theres that word 
again, and in comics weird is syn
onymous with writer Grant Mor
rison (see the classic Comic Relief 
#2!), whos outdonehimself again. 
Okay, Ill stop. Fine (uh, thats 
Latin for finish, yknow fin-ay?)

Professor Briggs delivers a history lesson
JOE BOB GOES TO THE 
DRIVE IN
by Joe Bob Briggs
Before I tell you about the best 
black drive-in flick of the year, 
you might need a little historical 
background, so here is the com
plete Joe Bob Briggs Guide to the 
History of Blaxploitation:
1971: Talkin bout Shaft is where 
it all begins, with Richard Round
tree in his slick brown leather 
coat, sleeping with every woman 
in New York, throwingMafia guys 
through plate-glass windows, and 
sliooting it out with Harlem gangs. 
Remember this line? I only got 
two problems, baby. I was born 
black and I was born poor. And 
then he throws her out of his 
apartment because hes sick of 
>eing a sex machine. Shaft is a 
great movie. The only reason 
people dont remember its a great 
movie is that they made Shafts 
Big Score (1972), Shaft in Africa 
(1973), and the Shaft CBS Tues
day Night Movie, which petered 
out in 1974.
' 1973: Super Fly was the first 
real honky-hater  Ron ONeal 
as a cokesnortin drug dealer who 
runs a 50-man operation pushing 
hard stuff to Whitey. Shaft didnt 
like anybody, white or black, and 
so he never became a role model 
for blaxploitation stars, but Su
per Fly had the platform shoes, 
Ithe threads and the essential 
jjouble-girlfriend lifestyle (one 
black girl, one white girl). Even 
though the sequel, Super Fly 
-T.N.T. (1973), was a huge bomb, 
?Ron ONeals portrayal of
Youngblood Priest was the begin
ning of the hard-core, bitter, letsstick-it-to-em black hero.
Now were rolling. In a threeyear period, there were better 
than 40 blaxploitation flicks, but 
there werent that many good 
ones. My favorites:
Blacula (1972): William
Marshall as the most bizarre 
vampire in history fits in per
fectly at El Lay parties, but Vonetta McGee as his beautiful blood
thirsty lover steals the movie. This 
movie started an incredible run of 
black horror flicks, beginning with 
the sequel, Scream, Blacula, 
Scream (1973), then Blackenstein, 
Ganja andHess,Abby, Sugar Hill 
and Dr. Black, Mr. Hyde.
Slaughter (1972): Jim Browns 
blaxploitation debut pits the 
blacks against the Eyetalians, 
with Jimbo as an ex-Green Beret 
whos avenging the murder of his 
gangster dad. Mostly an excuse 
for Jim to strut around kicking 
white guys in the teeth whenever 
they throw racial slurs his way.
Cleopatra Jones (1973): Tamara 
Dobson was the six-foot-two 
machinegun-toting Kung Fu 
Mama working narcotics assign
ments for the CIA. (Every great 
blaxploitation movie has some 
weird new secret branch of the 
CIA that nobodys ever heard of 
before.) But what really makes 
this movie great is one of the 
greatest villains of all time  
Shelley Winters as Mommy, the 
leather-clad lesbian heroin dealer, 
also known as super honky. 
Cleopatra drives a black Corvette, 
karate-chops gangsters from the 
opium fields of Turkey to the 
slums of Wans, and talks like 
this: Your head and your body is 
going to need separate mainte
nance. The sequel was Cleopatra 
Jones and the Casino of Gold 
(1975)
Five on the Black Hand Side 
(1973): The first blaxploitation 
parody film. The poster said
/ only got two problems, baby. I was 
born black and I was born poor.  And 
then he throws her out of his apart
ment because hes sick of being a 
sex machine.
Youve been coffized, blacurized, 
superflied! Youve been macked, 
hammered, slaughtered and 
shafted! This very funny film was 
followed by an even funnier one 
sixteen years later, Keenan Ivory 
Weyens Im Gonna Git You, 
Sucka! Both movies used many 
familiar black action stars.
The Mack (1973): Max Julien as 
the man whose ambition in life is 
to be the greatest pimp in the 
history of the world, because 
Being rich and black means 
something. Features actual foot
age of the Players Ball, the an
nual gathering of pimps in 
Oakland. Written by Robert J. 
Poole, who served five years in 
prison for 12 years of pimping.
Black Belt Jones (1974): After 
Bruce Lees brain exploded, his 
producers tried to make a star out 
of Jim Kelly, who was introduced 
in Bruce Lees greatest film, En
ter the Dragon. The kung fu was 
pretty decent, but Kelly disap
peared anyway.
And then, from there on out, 
the pickings got kinda slim:
Mister Mean (1977): One of the 
best action flicks by the man who 
has produced, directed and 
starred in more blaxploitation 
movies than anybody elseFred 
Williamson.
Penitentiary (1979): Leon Isaac 
Kennedy stars in a blaxploitation 
Rocky-rip-off prison flick about 
Too Sweet Gordone, the guy who 
gets put in prison because hes 
black, abused in prison because 
hes black, and forced to fight in
prison because hes black, but 
eventually gets out because he 
can box real well. The sequels are 
actually better flicks: Penitentiary
II (1982) and Penitentiary III 
(1987).
The Last Dragon (1985): Berry 
Gordy, the founder of Motown 
Records, made this flick about a 
teenager called Bruce Leroy 
because he wants to be a kung fu 
star. Featuring some great Van
ity songs and Julius J. Carry Ills 
historic performance as Sho Nuff, 
the Shogun of Harlem.
Action Jackson (1988): Carl 
Weathers backflips over a car and 
rescues Vanity from her heroin 
habit in the best blaxploitation 
flick of the eighties.
And now, in the nineties, weve 
got the first all-black contempo
rary horror action kung fu devilsex comedy, Def By Temptation, 
the story of a kinky freakozoid 
barfly woman with long gold fin
gernails whos possessed by the 
devil. She hangs out at the bars, 
leads men home by the nose, and 
then sexes em to death. Its not 
clear just exactly how she sexes 
em to death, except that at some 
point during the sex they start 
screaming and blood starts spurt
ing out of their faces.
The Devil Womans ultimate 
target is Joel, an innocent mum
bling choirboy from North Caro
lina who lives with his Grandma 
but comes to New York City for a 
couple of weeks to take a break 
before he becomes a full-time 
preacher. Joel is putty in her

his friend Kadeem Hardison from 
A Different World rides to the res
cue, spiking the Devil Womans

hooking up with a secret branch

gating devil-sex murders.
Sure, weve seen it before, but

looks to match PEs energy .level, 
Kane and 3rd Bass can toss at 
least equally slick raps, while 
Digital Underground flows on a 
mellow level that hardly anyone 
besides EPMD is even starting to 
play with. While the carnival style 
of rap shows is likely to limit
Digital Underground and 3rcl 
Bass to just the hits 
(Doowhutchalike and Te 
Humpty Dance for D.U.; The

Big Daddy Kane is well worth th

Join Together with The Who and their latest album
By KEVIN BARNEY
Tartan Features Editor
& STEPHEN GLICKER
Tartan Diversions Editor
; 1989. It was the year of reunion, if it 
\yas anything at all. Two of the biggest 
nd best bands of all time regrouped and 
^ent out on tour. First, it was The Who, 
breaking speed ticket sales. Several 
months later, The Rolling Stones went 
out on a tour of their very own, breaking 
some of the records that The Who had set 
scant months earlier. The Stones re
corded an album of all new original music 
^vhich turned out to be pretty good.
; Finally, in the early months of 1990, 
the final piece of this great regrouping is 
out: Join Together, a live album of The 
Whos music recorded during their 1989 
tour.
The first thing that strikes you when 
you pick up the album is the size of it. 
Depending on which version you buy, 
the album either comes with three rec
ords, two tapes, or two CDs; each version 
comes with a full color booklet with some 
cool pictures taken during the concert.
) All of this is contained in a large square 
f box. Another item you will probably notice 
is how the album is separated into two 
parts. The first CD consists of nothing 
btit songs from The Whos rock opera 
Tommy, while the second disk consists of 
1 various classic Who songs. Lets take a 
[ look at that first disk, shall we?
During The Whos 89 tour the group 
performed two special shows at Radio 
City Music Hall in New York City and 
the Universal Amphitheatre in Los 
[ Angeles, where they performed the rock 
j opera Tommy in full. This is where most
 Record Review 
???72 JOIN TOGETHER. The Who, MCA 
Records.
of the songs on the first disk were re
corded.
The disk starts off with the song 
Overture, and it might surprise you if 
youre used to the 1969 album Tommy. 
With the added horns and saxophones 
that The Who used during their tour, 
Overture becomes even more energetic 
and alive than the original.
Next comes 1921 which is faithful to 
the original, except for the fact that the 
parts of the mother are actually sung by 
a female and not Roger Daltrey, the lead 
singer. However, Amazing Journey and 
Sparks are by far two of the most sur
prising songs on the album.
With synthesizers, bass guitars, and 
drums in full force, these two songs be
come distant descendants of the ones on 
the album Tommy. Of all the songs on 
the first disk, these two take full advan
tage of The Whos orchestrathe sound 
is absolutely amazing.
Eyesight to the Blind (The Hawker) 
and Christmas are the next songs and 
sound great with cymbals flaring away 
in the background. Cousin Kevin fea
tures the first guest singer, Billy Idol, 
who plays the evil cousin Kevin. Only 
Idol could manage to take an already 
twisted and demented song and make it 
sound even more so.
The next song, Acid Queen, features 
another guest singer, Patti LaBelle, as 
the Acid Queen. Acid Queen in its own
courtesy RCA Records
right is a great song, but we dont think 
that LaBelle really added anything to it. 
Of course, nothing will probably ever top 
Tina Turners original version of Acid 
Queen, which she sang in the movie 
Tommy.
After Acid Queen, the third, and 
probably best guest singer, appears to 
strut his stuff. Elton John reprises his 
role as the Pinball Wizard to sing Pin
ball Wizard. You can easily tell that this 
was a favorite during the concert, for 
unlike a lot of the other songs, in this one 
you can hear the audience screaming all 
the way through. With Pete Townshend 
fading in and out with his guitar, egging 
the audience on, the extended musical 
score at the end of the song, and John 
singing away, one can easily see why the 
audience went so crazy.
Just when you thought that was the 
end of the guest singers yet another one 
appears. Phil Collins, who plays the role 
of Uncle Ernie, comes out to sing Fiddle 
About, and manages to make this short,
demented song rather amusing with that 
voice of his.
The next few songs Theres A Doctor, 
Go To The Mirror!, Smash The Mir
ror, Tommy Can You Hear Me?, and 
Im Free are more or less the same as 
the originals. Miracle Cure, although 
only 24 seconds long, is a mean song that 
makes you wish for more. Sally Simpson 
sounds great with the horns and is a 
treat to the ears.
The last few songs on the album, 
Sensation and Tommys Holiday 
Camp, sound amazing with the orches
tra and backup singers helping out. 
Were Not Gonna Take It! ends the disk 
with a bang. The explosive sound of the 
crowd, guitars, saxophones, synthesiz
ers, and singers for a full eight and a half 
minutes provide The Who with a spec
tacular exit from Tommy. All albums 
should end this well.
The second disk is all of the rest of The 
Who. No Tommy, just some great Who 
tunes. The disk starts out with a lesser 
known single from the 1982 Who album, 
Its Hard. Eminence Front is a blast 
and the horns sound great on it.
The best song, on either disk, is the live 
version of Face the Face. This single is 
from their album White City: A Novel. 
The first verse is sung by one of the back
up singers, Chyna. And she does an 
awesome job. Daltrey returns to the vo
cals for a few seconds, and then he an
nounces that the other guys going to 
sing, now. The other guy, either Billy 
Nicholls or Cleveland Watkiss (I dont 
recognize the voice and the program 
doesnt say who sang it), finishes the 
verse and he does wonders to the song. 
This is one of the best live songs ever.
You are probably asking yourself" 
What about the classic Who tunes? .- 
Dont worry, there are some on the al-' 
bum. In addition, some are missing. The 
most noticeable absence, for the diehard; 
Who fans who saw them somewhere in; 
the continental U.S., is Sister Disco. In 
concert, The Who sang Sister Disco 
and then went on to an acoustical ver
sion of it. That was a cool tune and the 
producers, for some unexplained reason, 
saw fit to scrap it.
Other absences that dont bother us 
are: My Generation, Magic Bus, and 
Who Are You. All of these live songs are,, 
on the other live Who album, Whos Last,J 
recorded during their Final American', 
Tour back in 1982.
On the other hand, there are some! 
good recordings of the classic Who tunes. 
These puppies are: I Can See for Miles, 
5:15, Love Reign Oer Me, Join To
gether, You Better You Bet, Behind 
Blue Eyes, and of course, Wont Get. 
Fooled Again. ^
Other, lesser-known tunes made the 
album also. Dig, Rough Boys, and A! 
Little is Enough are all from Pete 
Townshends solo career.
In conclusion, wed say that the digita^ 
recording quality of Join Together makes 
it worthwhile to buy, because The Who i 
the best live band around. If you are just 
looking for some live Who, then we would 
recommend buying Whos Last. Its a 
much better album, overall. ~
However, if youre looking for some 
new Tommy to listen to, then we^d 
strongly recommend that you buy Join 
Together. While youre at it, pick up the 
CD version for the full effect. Youll thank 
yourself that you did.
Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre season draws to a close
\ By DAWN BROSONSKI
' Tftrtan Asst. Diversions Editor
The Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre 
will bring to a close its highly 
successful 1989-90 season with 
', its final program, the Grand Tour 
^ Weekend, running Thursday 
through Sunday.
The performance will feature 
three ballets: the Pittsburgh pre
mieres of Choo-San Gohs In the 
. Glow of the Night and Bruce Wells 
j Mendelssohn: Violin Concerto, as 
ypell as Leonide Massines Gat 
Parisienne.
.. Choo-San Goh (1948-1987), cho
reographer of In the Glow of the 
x Night, spent his whole life im) mersed in the art of the dance. 
His works and performances have 
.been celebrated the world over. 
Goh created dance works for com
panies such as the American
Ballet Theatre and the Royal 
Swedish Ballet.
Goh received the choreographic 
award in the International Ballet 
Competition in Varna, Bulgaria, 
in 1983 for his pas deux from the 
ballet Momentum. For his contri
butions to dance, Goh received 
the 1987 Cultural Medallion of 
Singapore, the most prestigious 
award given by the government 
of Singapore to a citizen.
The PBT celebrates Gohs gen
ius with its performance of In the 
Glow of the Night, featuring danc
ers Janet Popeleski, Kip Sturm, 
Laura Desiree, Steven Annegam, 
and Tamar Rachelle.
The piece chronicles the events 
of a single evening in three pas
sages, and the evolution of feel
ings that result. The dance is 
abstract, as are many of his works, 
yet In the Glow of the Night
manages to suggest concrete ref
erences.
To me, dance is not just move
ment, Goh told New York Newsday. There should be a constant 
flow of energy through the finger
tips. Its the difference between a 
good sculpture and a bad sculp
ture. You have to tell the dancers 
they shouldnt be static. You have 
a reach in the body that contin
ues. Even if the curtain opens on 
that, it should be moving. Danc
ers never freeze themselves.
Bruce Wells is the PBTs first 
resident choreographer. For the 
final program, Wells presents his 
neo-classical ballet, Mendelssohn: 
Violin Concerto. The piece was 
inspired by the gypsy overtones 
of Mendelssohns score.
Just as Stravinsky is consid
ered a contributor to [George] 
Balanchines muse, says Wells,
Mendelssohn has been a strong 
contributor to mine. Ive done 
other ballets to Mendelssohn, 
most notably A Midsummer 
Nights Dream. Mendelssohns 
work always functions on two 
levels. In this music, as for that of 
Midsummer, a lovely lyrical 
phrase is supported by an ever
present staccato structure. The 
music has energy underneath. Its 
to that richly-layered quality that 
Im attracted.
Prior to joining the PBT, Wells 
was the associate artistic director 
and resident choreographer of the 
Boston Ballet, where he choreo
graphed more than 20 new works, 
most notably his production of A 
Midsummer Nights Dream, 
which had its successful premiere 
in Pittsburgh during the 1989-90 
season. The dance will return for 
the 1990-91 season.
Gat Parisienne, the final work 
in the Grand Tour Weekend, 
was choreographed by Leonide 
Massine (1895-1979). Choreo
graphed in 1938 for Ballets Russes 
de Monte Carlo, it was for many 
years that companys signature 
work.
Massine managed a dual ca
reer as dancer and choreographer 
during his lifetime. He became 
the ballet master for Ballet Russes 
in 1933 and created a number of 
dance works for them. He was 
appointed artistic director in 1938.
Massine went on to tour with 
his own campany, Ballet Russe 
Highlights (1945-46) and work in 
films. Perhaps his most famous 
moment came from his perform
ance as the crazed shoemaker in 
The Red Shoes (1948), a film 
widely heralded as a classic. Ac
cording to Massine, The Red Shoes
brought him more publicity thft 
he had ever had in his life. "
The PBT honors the talent of 
Massine by presenting his classic 
closing ballet, Gat Parisienne, 
a tale of romance and high spirits. 
It follows the adventures of a funloving Peruvian on his first vi^ft 
to Paris with the first meeting 
and ensuing love affair of a beau
tiful gloveseller and a nobleman.
PBT Artistic Director Patricia 
Wilde remembers: I saw Massine 
do the Peruvian during one of the 
earliest performances I ever at
tended. He was like a very fast 
snake. He never stopped moviil
 even his eyebrows wiggled.'!
The Grand Tour Weekend will 
run from April 19-22 at t/ve 
Benedum Center. For ticket infor
mation, please contact the

urging them not to even think 
about their plight, so that they 
may avoid the unnamed disaster 
that of discovering the cause of 
their misery. And with this de
nial of her daughters perception 
comes that of her own, as epito
mized by her interactions with 
her omniscient house-servant, La 
Poncia. Bernada both thirsts for 
knowledge, yet denies La Poncias 
warnings of dissension and forth
coming turmoil, wishing to know 
of reality only the direction in 
which she may most effectively 
avert her eyes. And the climax is 
the culmination of both these 
elements, a howling, hysterical 
damnation of life.
The performance itself seems 
to mimic the tempo of the play; 
sadly, both are somewhat slug
gish during the first half, lacking 
in that extroversion of spirit that 
leads the audience past the alien 
setting and dialogue to the dra
matic essence to which it serves 
as a vessel. The initial interaction 
between La Poncia and the Maid 
seems artificially sinister, as if 
they were ready to hop off at the 
call of their familiars. Bernadas 
voice is merely grating where it 
should be imperious. And simi
larly, the sisters seem more sleepy 
than glum; so that what should be 
poignant and pathetic serves only 
as comic relief.
Yet plot momentum and emo
tional sincerity seem to acceler
ate simultaneously, and by the 
second act the cast is in full form, 
exhibiting all the passionate, 
embittered energy called for by
the storylines tumultuous race 
towards disaster. The ending is a 
crescendo of frenzied precision, 
each cataclysm seeming more the 
well-calculated act of an expert 
bombardier than the designs of a 
writer or director.
The House of Bernada Alba is a 
tribute to consequence, so clear a 
depiction of the negative that what 
it evokes is not just revulsion, but 
a reverence for the positive. If the 
play is fraught with gloom, then 
its purposeful gloom, pathos with 
a point. Its in some way depress
ing that love for ones values is 
most strongly evoked by the pro
jection of their absence, but such 
is the role of tragedy, and The 
House of Bernada Alba serves this 
office with extraordinary effec
tiveness.

The Ramones are the crux of the problem in the upcoming film 
Rock n Roll High School.
Nothing too intellectual here: This cult flick has 
an entire high school up in arms over their right to 
play Ramones music whenever they please and at 
whatever volume they so choose. Ramones groupie 
Riff, played by P.J. Soles, leads her classmates in 
the fight against the new principal Miss Togar. 
Subplots include one teenagers quest to steal Riffs 
heart  the student even goes so far as to take 
lessons in proper dating maneuvers. The film in
cludes some classic scenes, such as tests where 
certain lab mice are forced to listen to Ramones 
music so that the experimenters can study the 
musics effects on the nations young minds. Its 
woith a dollar just to hear the soundtrack which 
features songs like Teenage Lobotomy and I 
Wanna Be Sedated.

Bugs Bunny Festival
Friday, April 20
Those wise-cracking, cynical Looney Toons from 
your childhood have returned to brighten your 
otherwise stressful, adult life. The best part of it is, 
most of this material will probably seem even 
funnier than you remember. Come see all of Bugs 
Bunnys pals: Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, Sylvester, 
Tweety Bird, Elmer Fudd and lots more. Of course, 
every characters voice comes from the versatile 
vocal chords of the late Mel Blanc and the anima
tion wouldnt be the same without Chuck Jones 
golden pen. You can be mature some other time  
reserve Friday night for an evening of wacky memo
ries thatll whisk you away from the daily college 
grind.
At 6, 8,10,12
Top Secret
Saturday, April 21
From the gang who brought you Airplane! and 
The Naked Gun, Top Secret has rock star Nick 
Rivers, played by Val Kilmer, travelling to East 
Germany to free the father of the woman he loves. 
Kilmer also manages to find time to do a spirited 
Elvis impersonation. Like the others in its genre, 
this movie has a taste for the strange and unex
pected. Dont think that it lives up to the high comic 
standards of the other two films; youll only be 
disappointed. Still, on its own there are enough fun 
moments in Top Secret to keep the movie afloat for 
90 minutes.
At 6, 8,10,12
Prizzis Honor
Sunday, April 22
Jack Nicholson plays a maa hit man who falls 
in love with a mysterious, beautiful woman por
trayed by Kathleen Turner. Unfortunately, 
Nicholson soon finds out that hes been assigned to 
bump Turner off. As one might imagine this pres
ents him with an interesting dilemma. This movies 
got some searing, comic lines but this is hardly one 
of Nicholsons best performances. (His phony ac
cent gets a tad annoying at times.) Still, the film is 
thick with plot, perhaps the blackest black comedy 
ever made, and for a dollar, will keep you reasona
bly entertained.

Scotch n Soda ushers in a new musical
continued from page L14
people who are as intimately 
involved with these characters as 
I am now.... I hope its, for every
body who worked on it, every
thing they wanted it to be when 
they came into the project. 
Trapped in the Silver Screen 
differs from most of Mullers pre
vious efforts. Most of what Ive 
been doing outside of this is just 
writing for myself and small 
groups. Jazz and rock things, and 
modem classical things. This is 
more audience responsive. 
Scotch n Soda actress Adams, 
an H&SS freshman, plays the 
heros abrasive sidekick Pervis.
Grillo-Marxuach originally wrote 
her part as a male character but 
gave Pervis a female identity for 
Trapped in the Silver Screen. 
Adams says of her character: She 
comes across as very obnoxious 
and a little overly aggressive for a 
woman in the thirties ... but un
derneath it all, shes very likable 
and very kind.
Adams enjoys taking on this 
unique persona. Its a lot of fun. 
Pervis gets to say a lot of things 
that normal inhibitions would 
prevent someone from saying. She 
uses a lot of tart language; shes 
very to the point.
This production allows the ac
tors in Scotch n Soda to display 
their many talents. Adams points 
out, We get to sing and dance 
and run around. We get to do a lot 
of physical comedy.
As a playwright, GrilloMarxuach is drawn to comedy as 
opposed to drama. He says, 
Comedy hurts a lot more. You 
really have to know pain to do 
comedy.... When youve done it 
correctly and the audience is 
laughing because they identify 
with the characters and what 
theyre going through, its not 
usually a pleasant thing that the 
characters are going through. If 
you can get the audience to laugh
at the same time that they feel for 
the characters, thats very reward
ing.
Rehearsal goes on well into the 
evening. There are few breaks for 
anyone involved and time is run
ning out. The play opens to fac
ulty and staff on Wednesday and 
will run in the ballroom Thurs
day, Friday, Saturday, and Sun
day.
During one scene in rehearsal, 
the exasperated writer cries out, 
I didnt write this! I didnt write 
this! Who writes this crap? From 
the platform, Grillo-Marxuach 
turns to his colleagues, a guilty 
smirk streaked across his face?
