Mark Hamlin will be taking 
over the position of director of, 
Dining Services, Sept. 26 to offer 
a fresh new perspective to CMUs 
Dining Services program. Roger 
Heydt, the current director of 
Dining Services, will remain an 
employee of the Marriott Corp. 
and will stay at CMU tempo
rarily as an advisor.
As many students have real
ized, Dining Services has been 
goingthroughnumerous changes 
due to the destruction of Skibo 
and the demand of faculty and 
students. We need to deal with 
the transition of Skibo not being 
here., said Neal Binstock, Asst 
VP for Business Services, We 
have to take the dining operation 
into the next century.
To help them do that, the Uni
versity has hired Hamlin. 
Binstock hopes Hamlin will bring 
a fresh perspective and new ideas 
to the dining operation. Binstock 
added, This is not an indictment 
or statement against any one per
son in particular.
Hamlin comes to CMU from 
James Madison University in 
Virginia. A school that was rated 
number two in the country for 
food managment. Students of
JMU praise what Hamlin has 
accomplished there, Dining Ser
vice here provides us with an 
assortment of meal choices, said 
Scott Hickey, a sophomore, Biol
ogy student at JMU, The major
ity of students do not dread eat
ing on campus.
One of Hamlins goals at the 
University is to give student more 
of an opportunity to voice their 
opinion about changes in the din
ning services. Students will be 
asked, they will be listened to, 
and they will be responded to in 
an honest and straight was, 
Hamlin commented.
He wants to build an environ
ment between dining services and 
the student body where, com
munication is the norm. Heydt, 
the current director, hopes that 
comes to pass, I would like to see 
all the parties work together to 
solve problems. he said. All the 
parties include Marriott, CMUs 
Food Co., CMU and all the em
ployees of Dinning Service. 
Hamlin was unable to comment 
on any definite plans for the 
future, although Binstock hopes 
one is to raise CMU dining up to 
the same level as JMU.
When Hamlin takes over as 
director, Heydt, will take on the 
position of an advisor. My ser
vices are available as needed and
requested, Heydt said.
Jim Gurley, District Manager 
of Marriott, praised Heydt on his 
work, Hes looked upon as being 
successful here at CMU.
Heydt looks forward to any new 
assignment. Im excited about 
the new freedom that this change 
will bring for me, he said. Gurley 
felt the move will be good for 
Heydt, Its healthy to move on 
after a period of time.
Hamlin is stepping into a con
stantly changing industry this 
year. Among the changes are the 
opening of Morewood, the Food 
Court scheduled to open in Build
ing D late in October and the 
possibility of some form of din
ning for the area near Baker 
andPorter Halls. Youll see 
change not for change sake, said 
Binstock.
Dining Services is making 
plans for internal change. We 
are instituting a new position here 
at the University, explained 
Binstock, it is a marketing, pro
motions coordinator. This posi
tion will be designed to come up 
with new ideas for dinning ser
vice to think about and experi
ment.
Roger Heydt leaves during a 
turbulent time. SDC voted unani

CMU joins Phi Beta 
Kappa honors fraternity
By BILL VANDERMARK
vecDed sydSUc uDeffhcSDoc
Phi Beta Kappa, the nations leading 
lonors fraternity for the liberal arts, 
will soon be making an appearance on 
Carnegie Mellons campus.S
A few years ago, four people under
took the grueling task of making this 
possible. Joseph Devine, Associate Head 
)fH&SS, Peter Stearns, DeanofH&SS, 
Susan Henry Dean of MCS, and BarLazarus Prof. of History, put in 
iong hours answering a barrage of ques
tions during the four year application 
process.
This marks the third attempt that 
CMU has made for a Phi Beta Kappa 
Chapter. The first two times the appli
cation was denied because of policies in 
the liberal arts studies. After reworking 
the education process for the better, the 
college re-applied and was rewarded. 
This will be a milestone in CMUs his
tory as we will step into the ranks of 
many outstanding universities that
house this time-honored fraternity.
Phi Beta Kappa is the oldest and most 
prestigious honors fraternity in the coun
try. It was established in the late eigh
teenth century to honor the outstanding 
students in the field of liberal arts. The 
entrance into the fraternity is very rig
orous. The Phi Beta Kappa Review Board 
looks at a students QPA, the credits 
theyve taken and in which department 
they have excelleD.
The students arent the only ones who 
are scrutinized, however. In order to be 
accepted as a branch chapter to Phi Beta 
Kappa, a school Has to complete a fouryear application process. In the midst of 
all the forms and questions, the univer
sity submitted a three-hundred page 
report detailing the criteria of the 
universitys liberal arts education pro
gram. Among the things the review board 
looks at is the students, the universitys 
holdings, their library selection, and un
dergraduate research opportunities.

Crew receives financial support
By ANGELA MOLLOY
recDed CaaSaDedD toha ngSDUc
After the Student Senate decidedlast 
Spring to cut the budget of the Univer
sity Rowing Club otherwise known as 
Crew, Dean of Student Affairs Michael 
Murphy was able to provide a little bit 
of relief, by making up the difference 
after Senate made a $5,000 cut.
After Senates decision to make cuts 
last semester, Murphy said that the 
Rowing Club never came to me ap
pealing Senates decision. Murphy 
attended Senate meetings where Sen
ate drew a plan that although they 
would be making cuts in the Crews 
budget, some portion of the Adminis
tration would be able to provide the 
money that Senate took away. A clause 
was also put in that said that if part of 
the Administration could not provide 
this money, Senate would give Crew 
the full amount for the 94-95 fiscal 
year.
Murphy said, Crew is a very expen
sive sport. Declan McCullagh, the 
Student Body, President would agree,
Crew gets twice as much as any other 
sports or recreation organization. 
Murphy feels that although Crew is 
expensive, it is an important sport, 
and that it was important for CMU to 
have a Crew team.
The Rowing Club has been receiving 
approximately $26,000 each year from 
the Senate. The Rowing Club has al
ways strived to do an enormous amount 
of fundraising, and in a given year can 
raise about $30,000 on its own.
Soren Roth, a senior Physics major, 
and Club President, said they are try
ing to make an effort to match what the 
Senate gives them. But when boats 
that the team use can total up to $15,000 
each, you are still dealing with a lot of 
large costs that represent tens of thou
sands of dollars, said McCullagh.
Funding for club sports has been an 
issue over the years, said Murphy, and 
the question of whether or not to have 
Crew go Varsity and be funded by the 
Athletic Department is also on the table.
The Crew Club includes several un
dergraduates but also faculty, gradu
ate students and staff that would not be
allowed to participate inVarsity sports. 
McCullagh said that Senate could 
split...costs and have the Athletic De
partment pay for the Varsity coach 
and the Student Government pay for 
the non-varsity coach. McCullagh be
lieves that the Student Activities Fee 
should subsidize for the non-varsity 
Crew... [but] Senate shouldnt pay for 
a Varsity Sport.
Murphy said right now the thing 
that is most important is to get discus
sions going on between Crew, Student 
Senate, and the Athletic Department. 
Murphy hopes that Crew can come up 
with a multi-year budget for the fu
ture. He also said that control of fund
ing should rest largely with the 
students...with some administrative 
oversight. He added that his office 
doesnt plan to provide any financial 
help after the end of the year [to the 
Rowing Club.]
Roth said that the Rowing Club is 
looking to distribute funding more 
widely so its more fair. Roth said the 
Club is looking for more sources to 
alleviate the burden.

Current problems 
not new to Haiti
By ANDREW SPROULE
recDed ngSDUcISdImwSof
Peace- <=s>keeping 
troops are 
currently be
ing deployed 
into Haiti by 
the United 
States. The country has a long history 
of political and economic struggle and 
oppression. Moreover, this is not the 
first time the U.S. has intervened in 
the country's affairs. Even with previ
ous intervention, Haiti hasnt been 
able to shake the trouble inherent in 
its existence.
In 1791 African slaves revolted 
against the French and eventually 
gained independence in 1804. The gen
erals of the revolution were heroes 
and took control of the country. Mim
icking the French, the generals ruled 
by exploiting the poor. This set up the 
pattern of tyranny that has remained 
in Haiti.
Due to political unrest, debts owed 
to the U.S., and strategic concerns 
during World War I, the U.S. invaded 
in 1915 and occupied Haiti until 1934. 
During the occupation, the U.S. 
crushed a nationalist revolt, killing 
thousands including its leader 
Charlemagne Peralte. When the ma
rines eventually pulled out, they left 
behind modem roads, public build
ings, established a Haitian army and 
stabilized the economy. In order to try 
and secure Haitis stability, the U.S. 
left behind a puppet government that 
continued the ruling by the lightskinned elite.
After a brief period of stability, tur
moil erupted in 1957.
Francois Papa Doc Duvalier, with 
elections rigged by the military, estab
lished a 29 year family dictatorship 
bolstered by his private militia, Tonton 
Macoutes.
In 1971, right before his death, 
Duvalier named his son Jean-Claude 
Baby Doc Duvalier president-for-life.
In 1980, after a brief period of rela
tively relaxed ruling, Baby Doc 
clamped down on free press and started 
losing popularity.
It was at this time that Haitian boat 
people started emigrating to America; 
however, due to an agreement between 
the U.S. and Haiti, the U.S. was able 
to repatriate the boat people, denying
them access to America.
1986 saw a military-tolerated upris
ing that led to the exile of Duvalier. A 
military junta took control of the gov
ernment. A planned election in 1987 
led to the massacre of civilians at the 
election polls  stopping what would 
have been the first ever democratic 
elections in Haitis turbulent political 
history. The army went on to rig elec
tions in 1988 which installed Leslie 
Manigat.
Manigat was then thrown out of 
office by Lt. General Henri Namphy 
who seized power. Namphy supported 
thugs, massacred worshipers, and 
burned down the church of the Rever
end Jean Bertrand Aristidea priest 
popular with the poor citizens of Haiti. 
Namphys reign quickly ended and Lt. 
General Prosper Avril seized power.
Once again, Haiti was unable to 
maintain any semblance of stability 
 politically or economically. 1990 
brought another popular uprising by 
the Haitians which threw Avril into 
exile and brought about the first ever 
non-rigged democratic elections in 
Haiti. Aristide wins with a landslide 
in December.
After his inauguration in February 
of 1991, Aristide nominated Raoul 
Cedras as the new army commanderin-chief. Cedras then turned on 
Aristideousting him from the presi
dency and the country.
Deprived of their elected leader and 
suffering from trade sanctions placed 
on the country, many Haitians re
sumed attempts to emigrate.
Clinton, going back on campaign 
promises, refused to allow the boat 
people into America and had the repa
triated.
Since that time, many diplomatic 
attempts to restore Aristide to power 
were made, including trade and im
port sanctions, by the UN.
These attempts led to the July 1993 
Governors Island accord in which 
Cedras promised to resign and restore 
the presidency to Aristide. Cedras 
broke that accord.
Currently, Cedras has agreed to re
linquish power and follow the guide
lines set out in the Governors Island 
agreement.
As of press time, their were 12 ships 
off the shores of Haiti and the Penta
gon estimated 20,000 troops that will 
eventually be involved in the inva
sion.
U.S. calls off Haiti invasion
POKT-AU-PRINCE, HAITI, Sept. 18Negotiators sent 
to Haiti by President Clinton have arranged a deal to halt 
the U.S. invasion of the countay that was scheduled for 
Sunday.
Former President Jimmy Carter reached an agreement 
Sunday night with. Haitian military leaders that allowed 
the U.S. to recall aircraft ferrying troops from the 82nd
Airborne.
Clinton addressed the public at 9 pm Sunday from the 
Oval Office to announce the agreement. An assault was to 
drop paratroopers into Haiti. The agreement reached by 
Carter halted any form of invasion by U.S. troops. Haitian 
envoy William Gray and National Security Advisor Tony 
Lake were dispatched by Clinton to brief the expelled, but 
popularly elected President, Jean-Bertrand Aristide. 
Aristides approval on any deal made with the men who 
deposed him would be needed to secure an agreement.
A key to calling off the invasion was former President 
Carter as well as the Clinton delegations talks that ran 
beyond the scheduled conclusion time. The extent of the 
talks raised hopes of avoidiWg an invasion; While Clinton 
remained inthe Oval Officethis weekend, on Saturday, he 
dispatched his diplomatic team that also included former 
Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Colin Powell and Senator 
Sam Nunn. The delegation met repeatedly with the Haitian 
military leaders who started a coup which ousted Aristide 
from power. U.S. forces were ready for an invasion had the 
talks failed or to ensure peace in the country if the Haitian 
military leaders agreed with any proposals.
Some 20,000 troops and 20 warships were awaiting the 
final orders from the President on Sunday. Their mission 
was to remove the ruling military dictatorship. For now, 
peace-keeping forces will be deployed to Haiti to ensure 
thatthe agreement reached by the U.S. will be carried out.

World Series 
cancelled
NEW YORK, Sept. 9 (DJ)At back-toback press conferences last Friday, base
ball owners and player representatives 
exchanged the usual denunciations and 
Acting Commissioner Bud Selig pulled 
the plug on the 1994 season. The move 
scrapped the World Series for the first 
time in 90 years.
The strike defied solutions partly be
cause the two sides viewed baseballs fi
nancial state so differently.
It could also be chalked up to public 
bluster impeding private talks. But mostly 
it was because both players and owners 
have been prisoners of history.
In the short run, baseballs manage
ment is giddy at finally facing down the 
players. They can now declare a bargain
ing impasse and attempt to impose a new 
system on their terms  the beginning of 
a salary cap, and the end of salary arbitra
tion.
They can attempt to start signing play
ers on their terms and test the staying 
power of the unions rank-and-file. But 
there could be many unintended conse
quences.
The owners, as much as the play
ers, are entering dangerous, un
charted waters. They could invite the 
repeal of baseballs antitrust exemp
tion. (Congressional hearings are 
scheduled for Sept. 22.)
The union will mount a multifront 
legal challenge. (One National Labor 
Relations Board complaint already 
has been filed.)
Clubs will be left in the tough posi
tion of marketing season tickets, lin
ing up promotions and selling TV 
advertising for a 1995 season that 
may not exist. A new league could 
even spring up.
Drugs a factor 
in DC crash
WASHINGTON, Sept. 14 (DJ)  
The Maryland man who died after 
crashing his stolen airplane onto the 
White House lawn had trace amounts 
of cocaine in his system and a bloodalcohol content slightly above the le
gal limit, officials said. Frank Corder, 
38, had a blood-alcohol content of 
0.045. The legal limit for pilots is 
0.04. Meanwhile, investigators be
lieve National Airport radar picked 
up the single-engine plane moments 
before it crashed and are trying to 
determine if the Secret Service was 
warned. Corder, a self-employed 
trucker, died in the crash when the 
stolen plane tore into the White House 
lawn and crashed through a magno
lia tree and crumbled against the 
south wall of the White House.
Corder had a history of alcohol and 
drug abuse. Treasury Secretary Lloyd 
Bentsen, who oversees the Secret Ser
vice, ordered an immediate review of 
the agencys security procedures yes
terday after the two-seat Cessna 150 
snuck up on stunned White House 
guards with only a moments notice.
Senior administration officials did
not publicly find immediate fault with 
the security system or Secret Service 
agents, but pointedly failed to guarantee 
that current procedures are adequate to 
prevent a similar incident.
Justice Dept, 
charges Boston 
company
BOSTON, Sept. (DJ)  The Justice 
Department filed a suit against Raytheon 
Co. (RTN) in U.S. District Court in Bos
ton, charging the company violated the 
False Claims Act by inflating the cost of 
a defense contract for a radar system.
In a press release, the Justice Depart
ment said the allegations relate to PAVE 
PAWS systems, a phased array radar 
system designed to detect incoming sub
marine-launched ballistic missiles.
In its suit, the Justice Department 
alleges Raytheon knowingly inflated its 
skill mix, or ratio of higher to lower 
skilled employees, to increase the price 
of the contract.
According to the suit, when the United 
States requested data on the skill mix, 
Raytheon said it did not have the infor
mation in the form requested by the U.S.
The government alleges Raytheon not 
only had the information in the requested 
form, but also analyzed the skill mix 
proposal.
A Raytheon spokeswoman said the 
company disclosed all the information 
that was required by law and all the 
information that was requested by the 
government. The spokeswoman said the 
company denies the governments alle
gations and the company will defend 
itself against the lawsuit.

Stearns feels that, This is a national 
testimony to the quality of liberal arts 
education at CMU. Im pleased because 
Phi Beta Kappa is flattering and re
warding, and its nice to finally have 
those deserving students recognized for 
their achievements.
Similar thoughts came from Lazarus, 
I want to congratulate all the students 
on this academic honor. They are very 
deserving of this.
I feel that it is the most prestigious 
academic honor which a student of the 
arts and sciences can receive. This just 
goes to show how much we value our 
students and their education here at 
Carnegie Mellon.
Both Stearns and Lazarus graduated 
Phi Beta Kappa from Harvard and

Art professor dies
By Edward Hayes
CMDSdi recDed toha ngSDUc
Early Tuesday morning Harry Hol
land, an art professor in CFA, passed 
away after a six-year struggle with 
cancer. He was 57 years old.
Holland came to CMU in 1963. He 
was the pioneer computing artist at 
CMU, said Mary Schmidt, the associ
ate department head.
He started out as a painting instruc
tor until being appointed assistant pro
fessor in 1965 and associate professor 
in 1970. He was named art professor in 
1981. Among his accomplishments were 
creating the software program Panda 
for computing imagery and earning a 
master of fine arts degree in painting 
from Carnegie Institute of Technology
in 1963.Holland was diagnosed with 
Cancer in the summer of 1988. His 
struggle continued when he left CMU 
for a year after a liver transplant. He 
returned to school and seemed fine until 
the cancer struck again. The disease 
was pervasive and in the end, it was not 
isolated to just one part of the body.
He was an extraordinary artist, intel
lect and teacher, said Schmidt, as shown 
by Hollands earning of the Henry 
Hornbostel College of Fine Arts Teach
ing Award in 1982. Holland is survived 
by his wife, Dena, and two sons, Tom 
and Dan. A memorial Service will be 
held on September 24 at 3 pm at the 
Unitarian Church in Shadyside. Said 
Schmidt, [Harry] was a world-class in

Department will always remember him.

agrees that academics would 
come first, there are other things 
that perhaps her office or the 
Residence Life Office could pro
vide.
Shields and the Office of Stu
dent Affairs wants to work hard 
to address quality of life issues 
and the quality of campus life 
that makes a difference in 
students lives.
She would also like to tap is
sues that concern Graduate Stu
dents, a topic she said may be one 
where CMU hasnt explored as 
far as I think we could.
Shields position was created 
last spring, and since she has 
taken the job, the office has been 
reorganized.
At the top of list is Dean of 
Student Affairs Michael Murphy, 
then Shields as associate dean, 
then four assistant deans, and 
finally, also a new feature, eight 
student interns.
Murphy said the Office needed 
some change in order to make it a 
department in its own right. 
There are eight offices dedi
cated to students needs on cam
pus.
They are Student Activities, 
Housing, Residence Life, Health 
Services, Counseling Center, In
ternational Education, the Ca
reer Center, and the Office of 
Student Affairs. Murphy said it 
was time to have somebody else 
to run this office.
Of Pittsburgh, Shields said its 
more like amidwestem city then 
I thought.
With students concerns in 
mind and the desire to help stu
dents have a positive university 
experience, Anne Shields said 
sheneeds to meet more stu

In the coming months, Shields 
would like to explore the issues 
and concerns of the student body 
at CMU by talking to students 
and keeping her ears open.

Athletic department 
must recognize crew
At the end of last semester, 
the Rowing Club was faced with 
a $5,000 budget deficit. Student 
Senate had again swung its 
mighty ax, andwith one swift 
blow  left the Rowing Club up 
the river without a paddle. Ac
tually, Senates resolution con
tained a clause which stated that 
if some portion of the Carnegie 
Mellon administration could not 
provide the $5,000, Senate 
would supply it for the 94-95 
academic school year.
In stepped Student Affairs, 
their checkbook, and the Dean 
of Student Affairs Michael 
Murphy. The Rowing Club was 
saved to row again. While we 
applaud Dean Murphy, this is 
only a quick fix to a much larger 
problem.
What will be the fate of the 
Rowing Club? Who will be stuck 
with the bill next year? Will 
their subsidy be lowered? Will 
Crew be stiffed again by Sen
ate? Will the Athletic Depart
ment foot the bill and let them 
go Varsity?
Currently the Rowing Club 
matches their Senate allocation 
with their own money from 
fundraising. This totals nearly 
$30,000 a year. Unfortunately, 
their own resources and the de
creasing Senatefunding will not 
be enough to keep them afloat 
for another year.
With the cost of boats nearing 
$15,000 and competition travel 
expenses, the Rowing Club 
needs a long term plan for its
When Skibo came down this 
late last summer to make way 
for the new University Center, 
one of Carnegie Mellons most 
popular institutionsScotland 
Yard  went down with it. We 
were particularly dismayed to 
see The Yard, as it was widely 
known, disappear since its im
mediate fate was uncertain. 
There were no definite plans for 
its relocation as of its closing at 
the end of last semester.
Now, it seems that The Yard 
may soon reappear in the 
Morewood Gardens Rec Room. 
We applaud the Universitys 
effort to bring it back. However, 
we are concerned about several 
of the particulars of this plan.
The Yards new location pre
sents a number of possible prob
lems. First, it will share the 
Morewood Rec Room space with 
the Faculty Dining Room, and 
thus will not be operational dur
ing lunch time hours.
We feel that the Yard deserves 
its own space, which would en
able it to serve lunch  an im
portant factor, especially given 
our campuss current shortage 
of convenient or good eating fa
cilities.
The relatively small size of 
the Rec Room as compared to 
the old Yard could cause over
crowding. Finally, since The 
Yard will be in a dorm, the added 
noise and traffic could inconve
nience Morewood residents, par
ticularly those living in A and
budget with some sort of guar
anteed funding.
Enter the Athletic Depart
ment. Understandably, they are 
reluctant to add another team 
to their already tight budget, 
but after all, isnt it their re
sponsibility to promote the com
petition of the finest athletes in 
their respective fields of exper
tise? Truthfully, it may not be 
the best solution for the Rowing 
Club. (Faculty, staff, and gradu
ate students will not be allowed 
to participate on the Varsity 
team.)
The Rowing Clubs plan has 
foreseen that problem and come 
up with a solution. Their sched
ule would be split up by semes
ter: one semester they would 
compete on the club level, and 
the next semester they would 
compete on the varsity level. 
The biggest benefit to going var
sity might help guaranty fund
ing.
Student Senate, the Rowing 
Club, and the Athletic Depart
ment must meet to discuss what 
is the best solution for one of 
CMUs finest teams. We dont 
want to lose them, but where 
will the money come from?
Were sure that there are ar
guments on both sides  as 
there always are when money is 
concerned.
But the Rowing Club is a vital 
sport on this campus and we 
need to hold on to the team that 
has brought us athletic excel
lence for many years.
E-towers.
Considering these potential 
problems, we cannot help but 
wonder why the Yard was not 
moved to a better location. The 
Student Center would have been 
an excellent place, since it al
ready serves numerous student 
organizations. Instead of the 
classroom space the Center cur
rently houses, why didnt the 
University think to move the 
Yard there?
The East side of campus was 
another good possibility, since 
students living there who dont 
always have meal plans (and 
thus dont usually eat at High
lander) currently have no 
nearby alternative eatery. Other 
possibilities were Smith Hall, 
which now has vacant space; 
the old Post Office and Campus 
Security spaces in Baker Hall; 
or the basement of Morewood.
Finally, we wonder whether 
the new Yard will offer students 
the same kinds of amenities as 
the old one did  poetry read
ings, movies, live concerts, one 
of the only places on campus 
where indoor smoking was per
mitted, and, with a 3 am closing 
time, the only dining facility on 
campus that was open after 
midnight.
Will the new Yard measure 
up? Ideally, we would like to see 
all of these things in place there. 
It might just make the wait for 
the new University Center seem 
a little bit shorter.

Editor:
In reference to The 
Tartans editorial 
[Student groups 
must resist conscrip
tion, 9/12], I would 
like to fill in some background to the 
framework of your editorial and correct 
some errors.
As readers may or may not know, for 
the last 50 or so years, Alpha Phi Omga, 
the service fraternity, acted as Elections 
Board for Student Government. A few 
years ago, this tradition ended due to 
Senate invalidating its own elections 
and holding A Phi O responsible. In the 
elections since, we have attempted ev
ery possible way to recruit a functional 
elections board, from allowing Senators 
whose seats were not yet up on the 
board, to actually paying members of 
the Board. None has been satisfactory; 
every election board has been under
staffed and overworked.
An error of fact in your editorial stated 
that the requirement that all student 
organizations are required to send me 
two names. Not so; I only require it of 
those who receive monies allocated by 
Senate. We already require several items 
from such organizations.
Exceptions will be made for certain 
organizations. In the language of your 
editorial, that is not fair. And I will be 
the first to admit it that is not. The 
Tartan and rwo uDygodD bdSUdH funded 
organizations, are both exempt because 
of their journalistic responsibilities. It 
doesnt make much sense to have names 
submitted from those organizations: they 
would be the first to be removed from the 
prospective board list to be approved by 
Senate, for those very reasons.
This is not a great burden that Ive
placed on organizations. In the past, 10- 
member election boards have had to d1 
more work than A Phi O did and more 
work than any election board should. 
But this semester, with a potential pool 
of 75 - 80 names, we can cull down toa 
35-member board who will not need to 
spend more than two hours staffing th> 
polls and counting the votes.
Well, I admit it. Im evil. I want orga
nizations to do my bidding and submitto 
my will. Or: Ive done what needs to be 
done. Pure and simple: Senate needs an 
elections board, and this seems to be thi 
only effective way to recruit one. If the 
Editorial Board of The Tartan has a 
better suggestion, please go ahead and 
send it to me. Ive obtained names of 
students interested in volunteering time 
from Student Affairs. Ive put adsinTb 
Tartan. Ive called everyone I know that 
even had a chance of accepting. Unfortu
nately, once again, Senate has to use the 
only power that seems to attract 
students notice: holding on to their tax 
money a little while longer.
I encourage all members of the stu
dent body to get in touch with me if you 
have questions or concerns. Also, I did 
not intend the freezing to be strict; 
exceptions will be made. But weve got 
more important things to worry about 
now than you spending two hours o. 
your time to help elect your government. 
Theres a Homecoming picnic which may 
not get paid for. The Tartan, as of my 
last update, is still over $20,000 in debt. 
Dining Services has sunk to a new low. 
And so on. I appreciate the attentioi 
from The Tartan, but lets turn to impor
tant issues instead of blowing the trivial 
ones out of proportion.

Im here to talk about the Crime Bill, er, Law, er, whatever 
(Criminal Control Act of1993). I know this is going to seem 
like closing the barn door after the horse is in the next 
county, but I feel that people ought to know what was just 
inflicted on them. This law (actually a huge mishmash of 
laws and grants) is quite scary in some sections and a farce
in others. ____________________________
First of all, Ill grant that my 
initial opposition to the Bill was 
based on the Assault Weapons 
ban. "The amount of hysteria and 
misinformation flung about on 
this subject was truly amazing.
The weapons on the banned list 
have amounted to well under one 
percent of all gun crimes, with 
some of them having never de
monstrably been used in a crime. Such claims as Senator 
Diane Feinstein (D-CA) claiming that the weapons on the

our government has a huge deficit and debt, and this bill adds 
$30 billion in new spending? Mind you, the bill only provides 
for funding of $20 billion worth (this $20 billion is from Vice 
President A1 Gores re-inventing government savings, so for
get about that for debt relief). I wonder where the extra $1?- 
billion will come from. I guess, as is always the case with 
Congress, it will just grow on a tree or something.
Crime is a serious problem; solving it should not be an issue 
of cost. I guess this is a somewhat valid, though not com
pletely airtight statement, especially with the current state of 
federal finances. One can certainly argue about causes 
solutions. Im not going to go into causes here, since that woulk 
bring up personal ethics, and of course thats a no-no in a public

Why is it that so many people these 
days think that we have to have our 
problems solved by the Federal 
Government? Why do people as
sume that a huge centralized bu
reaucracy will be more effective than 
settling things on a local level?

the problem. They have lots of re 
sources to spread real thinly. Where do they get all the

shots are so utterly nonsensical as to amaze one. Of course 
this didnt raise any alarms with the media on whether or not 
it was truthful, they do little to mask their overt opposition 
to lawful gun ownership rights.
I know youre going to say, Hes just a gun nut; thats not 
a real reason to oppose the law. Well, how about the fact that
your reps have. Anybody notice why West Virginia has 
real nice highways? You see Senator Byrd has a mighty large 
amount of pull, and thus West Virginia ends up with muc'1

Media makes mayhem out of air tragedy
Mahua Dutta
The crash of USAir flight 427 is a tragedy. 
What makes the crash even sadder is the 
insensitive beha'vior of the local media. Some 
of you may think that this is to be expected. 
The media always has a field day with cata
strophic events. I remember how my local 
paper dealt with the crash of PanAm flight 
106 over Lockerbie, Scotland. The pilot of 
that flight was from my town. The week 
after the crash, the front page of the town 
paper ran a photo of a Philadelphia news 
crew hiding out in bushes in front of the 
pilots house. I dont know which is worse  
the media stalking the victims family, or 
the local paper photographing it and using 
that picture as accompaniment to the story 
about the crash. Then there was the Gulf 
War. You all remember that, dont you? It 
was that miniseries on CNN two years ago.
The coverage of flight 427 follows this line 
of sleaze reporting. Yes, we need to know 
what happened; its not a nice story, but it 
has to be told. But is all this necessary?
There seems to be sick fascination with 
gore. Channel 11, the local NBC station, 
couldnt get enough of it. On the night of the 
crash they broadcast phone calls from ran
dom people who had seen the plane go down. 
Chuck down at the bar could get his two
minutes of fame by calling in and talking 
about what he may or may not have seen. 
The station was so involved with wanting 
to cover the story that they continued to 
broadcast live for hours even though there 
was no more news about the crash that 
night. Rescue teams, fire fighters, and 
investigators were trying to get as much 
done that night as they could. The news 
teams must have gotten in the way. At 
the very least 
they must have 
annoyed the in
vestigators by 
hanging around 
the site for so 
long.
The most grat
ing part of the 
coverage from 
the night of the 
crash is how the 
anchorman kept 
repeating, we 
have nothing
new to report. This was discussed in one 
of my classes this week. The professor 
noted how news programs always update 
viewers on the fact that there is nothing 
new to say. A student in that class men
tioned how news programs also like to 
guess.
Newscasters are always saying things 
like, It hasnt been confirmed, but it may 
be....  Or theyll say something like, In
vestigators are looking into... in a tone 
that suggests that the probable has al
ready happened. In a news brief this 
past Thursday afternoon, Della Crews, 
the anchorwoman on Channel 11 News, 
closed her little news quip by saying 
that they learned from a local paper that 
a federal witness in a drug trial was on 
flight 427. She didnt say that authori
ties confirmed the finding. Although 
what she said 
was probably 
true, her voice 
implied that it 
was related to 
the crash, and 
there is no way 
she could vali
date that. The 
way she spoke 
made it seem as 
though she had 
a conspiracy 
theory to sell to 
Oliver Stone.
The way every news anchor has spo
ken about the crash has been ridiculous. 
In fact, their behavior as an entire group 
has been ridiculous. Theyve been rub
bernecking under the guise of serious 
journalism. Even their attempts at be
ing sensitive have been terrible. After 
the news programs, the names of the 
victims are listed as sad-yet-caring 
music plays. It looks like the credits
Gabrien Symons/Tartan Artist
from a bad movie. Sometimes theyll even 
do this with photographs of the victims. I 
offer sympathy to those who knew them, 
but how many times do I have to see the 
picture of the Weavers? This televised 
obituary makes a mockery of their death.
The obituary routine is almost as bad as 
the woman on the news who, on the night 
of the crash, in her live report to the 
station claimed she was the first to report 
that there were no survivors. One of my 
roommates put it best when she asked, Is 
this woman proud of herself or something? 
All this reminds me of a line from a Don 
Henley song, TScD3 /eydgc3: Theres a 
bubble headed bleach blonde on the news 
at five. Shell tell you about the plane 
crash with a gleam in her eye. Its interest
ing when people die....
Why is the media covering the crash in 
this manner? Is it some sick type of com
petition? Do they think that we want this? 
Who knows? Maybe we do want it. Shows 
like mUPaH NoaMyo JVVH -ocepgUH and the 
three Amy Fisher TV movies are every
where. Maybe there are people out there 
who really do want this type of garbage. 
Maybe this is what weve come toa gory, 
tabloid society. Maybe thats why the Pitts
burgh news stations have been able to 
turn a tragedy into a circus side show.

NRA embodies societys worst elements
Matt Ball
In debates, the traditional court 
method is usually used: one side 
presents their argument, then the 
other. Experts can be found to 
testify about anything: the green
house effect is good, cloth diapers 
destroy the environment, chlorofluorocarbons cannot hurt us 
(because they were made by us 
for our benefitRush Limbaugh).
The same is true of guns. People 
will bear witness that widespread 
weaponry is the only avenue to 
avert absolute anarchy. They will 
ignore other societies without the 
NRA, a national obsession with 
firearms, and a violent crime 
problem, saying only that these 
countries are not civilizations but 
collections of cowed barbarians. 
This lack of civilization may come 
as a surprise to the French, Ger
mans, Italians, and others who 
just might resent being called 
barbarians by a society where 
fun involves shooting friends with
paint or stun guns, 11-year-olds 
kill and are killed, and tourists 
are shot dead on the highways.
And so, in this society hemor
rhaging with guns, we are told 
that the only solution, the only 
means by which we can be 
safe, is more guns. Civiliza
tion does not come by ethics 
or the rule of law, but by 
being cowed by the threat 
of immediate and deadly re
taliation. We are told that 
our violent society, with 
$20/hour rent-a-gun mar
kets on the street, is the 
creation of the gun-control 
lobby, not the NRA.
The NRA puts on a good 
show of being concerned for 
the safety of the citizens of 
this country, and, given the 
infestation of guns and vio
lent crime facing us, can 
make a persuasive, if back
wards, argument that more 
guns are necessary. If this were 
the case, however, what the NRA 
would promote would be fairly 
simple and fairly narrow: access 
to one defensive gun for each lawabiding citizen. They would also
be developing non-lethal means police lobby on nearly every piece 
of protection, working closely with of legislation bring safer streets? 
police for crime-prevention legis- This is not to argue over the 
lation, and focused on decreasing efficacy of these laws or the roots

Does this sound like the agenda when one listens to the NRA long
enough, one is certain to 
become aware that the 
main concern is not angst 
over protection but an 
obsession with lethal 
force. If an individual, es
pecially an upper-middleclass white male, already 
owns multiple guns, is it 
necessary to contribute to 
an organization that 
spends millions to defend 
street-sweeper shot
guns?
Although it is true that 
people kill people (and any 
weaker creature), guns 
are instruments created 
by people for the single

Though it may unfortunately 
be true that there are extreme 
cases in which the threat of vio

threat of retaliation, these excep
tions do not mean that violence is 
ever anything more than the 
lesser of two evils. Guns are not a

where more and more of us live

To change things we have to work 
away from violence as a solution,

LAW, from page 4
spent in a way proportional to which states 
send in the most federal revenues, Pennsyl
vania fell short by about 57 million dollars. 
California fell short about 150 million dol
lars. Most of the other populous states also 
got the short end of the stick.
The bill toughens the laws with more 
death penalties and federal crimes. rwSa Sa 
e iUUg DwSdiGG I dont think so. I dont 
oppose the death penalty myself, but some 
of the excuses for it in this bill are not really 
rational. They have the death penalty for
drug lords. How do you define a drug 
lord? Does this mean that someone grow
ing dope in his back yard (or dorm room) 
gets the chair? A lot of the provisions in 
this bill have the death penalty given for 
things which simply arent murder. I cant 
agree with that.
How many of you know about the ex
pansion of RICO seizures which the new 
laws entails? If somebody accuses you of 
being a drug dealer, your assets can be 
seized. You dont even need to be charged. 
Youre guilty until proven innocent, and
you probably wont get back all of your 
property even if you are exonerated. 
This is just a further extension of the 
War on some Drugs which has been 
eroding civil rights in the country for a 
while. Also, just to move this along, 
informants get a cut of the seizure and 
can have their own crimes up to and 
including murder lessened for the aid 
they give. Everyone still have that warm 
fuzzy feeling about how much safer we 
all are?
I hope Ive gotten my point across. You
dont have to be a gun nut to oppose this 
law. You simply have to be a citizen who 
cares about his rights as protected by the 
Constitution. This law does quite a bang-up 
job on stomping the Bill of Rights. On the 
chopping block are the first, second, fourth, 
fifth, and 10th amendments, but then when 
was the last time the President and Com
pany really cared about the Bill of Rights?

Coming to the meeting is IMPORTANT. For example, Dining Services just wants to serve DRINKS and BAKERY ITEMS at Scodand Yard. And they want to close the Yard at 
12:30 am instead of 2 am. If you want the Yard to be more like what it was in Skibo, you have to show up and let them know. We have to convince them this is what students want, and numbers count.
FOOD AND DRINKS will be served. For more information about the meeting or the plans for Scodand Yard, contact Declan McCullagh, Student Body President, at 268-

Scodand Yard will open in a few weeks, but we need YOUR help. 
(And well feed you, too.)
We need YOU to come to a Scodand Yard open meeting this Thursday, September 22 at 7 pm in the old Morewood Rec Room. (Turn right as as you go in Morewoods main entrance.)
At the meeting you can talk with Dining Services and Student Government representatives and tell them what you want Scodand Yard to be like. Dining Services ran Scodand Yard last year, and theyve agreed to run it this year, but they NED OUR INPUT.

Mens soccer falls from ranks of unbeaten
jgy MATTHEW J. SOLITRO
recDed sydSUc uDeffhcSDoc
This past week was a difficult 
one for the mens varsity soccer 
am as they faced two of their 
^ugliest opponents of the seaon. They played very well, but 
nded up with only a tie and a 
oss.
This past Saturday afternoon, 
;he Tartans hosted the Washingun University of St. Louis Bears. 
Washington, who is favored to 
with the UAA this year, matched 
up pretty evenly with CMU in 
ill and speed. Both teams 
played very intensely in spite of 
;he pouring rain and slick turf. 
The Tartans got on the board 
irst when senior Vince Russell 
gent a free kick from practically 
he middle of the field into the 
lenalty box. Senior forward Alex 
Amezquita ran behind the de
fense and one-timed it past the 
Washington goalie. After the goal, 
action was going both ways, but 
3MU was controlling the ball 
>etter in the midfield with short 
quick passes and plenty of sup
port for the person with the ball. 
Washington was almost able to 
ret a clear shot on net from close 
ange when sophomore defender 
3uraj Naik made a great defen
sive play and stole the ball from a 
Washington defender.
Near the end of the first half, 
!MU sent a number oflong passes 
to senior forward Mike Brazinski 
who was able to beat the Wash
ington defenders a number of
times but was not able to score, yards out. Washington came out

defense and 
drawing a 
number of 
fouls. Wash
ington, a larger 
and more phys
ical team than 
CMU, started 
to play really 
rough in the 
second half.
The game re
ally started to 
open up near 
the end of regu
lation, and with six minutes re
maining, Washington tied the 
game at one apiece with an open 
shot from 10 yards out. At the 
end of regulation, the game was 
still tied so they went to over
time.
Goal scoring erupted in over
time. Amezquita gave the Tar
tans the first goal in overtime 
when he burned a defender at the 
top of the penalty box and made a 
low shot past a charging goalie.
However, the Bears retaliated 
quickly with a rocket from 30

midfielder Vince Russell, whose 
shot from 18 yards out tied the 
game at 33, which is where the 
game ended.
The tie was a good result for the 
Tartans against this tough UAA 
opponent. However, there was 
some disappointment since they 
held the lead for the majority of 
the game. Weve got to learn to 
play with a one goal lead when 
you have it, said head coach Nick 
Gaudioso. There were a couple 
of times that I thought we werent 
going to come back. In this conference when your down by a goal, 
its very tough to come back.
Overall, the Tartans played a 
very high pressure game, but they 
let down their guard a few too 
many times to pull out the win. I 
thought we played pretty in
tense, said Amezquita. We just 
had a little bit of bad luck, a 
couple letdowns. They cashed in 
when we let ourselves down. 
When the defense makes a mis
take youve got to cash in. Thats 
what we did, and thats what they 
did.
This past Wednesday night, the 
Tartans traveled down the road 
to challenge the Division I Uni
versity of Pittsburgh Panthers. 
The high humidity and slippery 
turf did not hinder this exciting 
and high scoring game. The game 
started out with action going back 
and forth. Neither team was re
ally controlling the game, in spite 
of Pitts slight skill advantage. 
Both teams were sending the ball 
long and then controlling it in 
their offensive end. Brazinski was 
able to bum past the defender on 
the left side and cross the ball 
right in front of Pitts net, but the 
Tartans were unable to knock it 
in.
A short time later, a Pitt for
ward was able to squeak though 
the Tartan defense. Warren 
started to come out of the net, but 
the Pitt player was able to blast it 
into the net before Warren could 
cut down his angle. After the goal, 
Pitt started to get really physical 
and received a yellow card as a
result. Before the end of the half, 
Pitt was able to score again on a 
low shot from 25 yards out to the 
far comer of the net. Unfortu
nately, Warren slipped on the 
wet turf as he dove for the ball. At 
halftime, the Panthers led 2-0.
The Tartans were on fire at the 
start of the second half. They 
were keeping the ball in their
Amezquita who headed the ball 
to Buelow at the top on the pen
alty box. He sent a rocket just 
over the outstretched arms of the 
goalie and into the top section of 
the net. With the Tartans only 
down by one goal, the game 
started to get really exciting. Se
nior Jeff McJunkin was able to 
stop the Panther on a fast break,

We need a confidence builder, said 
womens volleyball senior co-captain 
( Carolyn Skarada, before leaving Friday 
for the two-day Marietta College Tourfnamentin Ohio. But her hopes remained 
unanswered as the Tartans turned in a 
disappointing 0-5 performance at their 
first tournament of the season.
The Tartans played hard but failed to 
take a single match at Marietta, winfoing only one of 11 games played. The 
team was defeated four times in pool 
play  losing 2-0 (9-15, 4-15) to 
' Marietta, 2-0 (4-15, 5-15) to Guilford, 
2-0 (9-15, 4-15) to Bluffton, and 2-1 
(159, 3-15, 015) to Hanover  and?
was beaten 2-0 (8-15,515) by AldersonBroaddus in the sudden-death consola
tion bracket.
Skarada cited the tournaments bests 0f-3 play as a factor in their perfor[ mance: They were very quick matches, 
she said, and were notorious for being 
 a slow-starting team. Fellow senior co; captain Molly Brennan blamed the 
teams inconsistency. Sometimes well
go out there, score fast, and then fall 
apart, she said, We did a lot of good 
things, just not all at once.
Both co-captains agree that the final 
record doesnt reflect how the team 
played, nor its overall potential. We ran 
offensive plays and our blocking was

pulled off a lot of those matches.
Our last match, we really came out 
fighting, added Skarada. That showed 
a lot of character.
Last Tuesday, the Tartans were de
feated by the University of Pittsburgh at 
Johnstown by a score of 3-1 (3-15,8-15,

Last Saturday the Tartans traveled 
to Memphis, Tennessee, the home of 
Elvis Presley, to battle the Rhodes Col
lege Lynx at Fargason Field. After the 
game the Tartans had the Lynx singing 
the blues as the final score was 30-3 in 
favor of the Tartans. In fact, the Tar
tans kind of made Fargason Field look 
like the Heartbreak Hotel to Rhodes.
It was the first time the two teams 
had ever played each other, which might 
have explained the scoreless first quar
ter. However the Tartans did pass up 
some early opportunities to score. On 
the first drive of the game, the Tartans 
marched to the Lynx 38 yard line, but 
fumbled the ball away. On the next 
Tartan drive, senior quarterback Chris 
Dee failed to 
connect with 
sophomore 
Buck Neel on 
a long third 
down pass 
and the Tar
tans were 
forced to 
punt. On the 
next drive it 
was Rhodes 
that went for 
the bomb, 
but senior 
corner-back 
Nathan Mor
gan inter
cepted the 
ball at the 13 
yard line to 
keep the 
Lynx out of 
the end zone.
The second quarter began with a long 
Tartan drive. After runs of 12 and 13 
yards, senior fullback Jason Grusky 
ran it in from the two to give the Tar
tans a 7-0 lead. The Tartans drove 60 
yards in just under five minutes during 
their scoring drive. Carnegie Mellons 
seven-point lead was threatened, how
ever, with about two minutes left in the 
first half. Rhodes had the ball at the 
Carnegie Mellon 48 yard line on fourth 
down and two yards to go. Rhodes tried 
to mn around the Tartan defense, but 
the Tartans shut down the mn for no

by Anuj Gupta
All right, its over. No feelings 
pour out, no resentments to be 
oiced, nothing will do any good 
this point, because the major 
(league baseball season is over.
'So what can we look forward 
to now? you ask  a perfectly 
legitimate question due to the 
ct that we have no clue as to 
fhat baseball will offer us in the 
iture and at what time.
How does arena baseball sound 
is an idea? We could move the 
fences in 90 feet and require a 
ance team to perform between 
tings. I would also assume that 
[t wont be too long before the
players union starts griping that 
90 feet is too far to run or that 
pitching overhand is ruining too 
many arms. Therefore our new 
league could include crowd 
pleasers such as 25.5 feet between 
bases and underhand soft tosses 
from the so-called pitchers. Jim 
Palmer may even be a Cy Young 
candidate again as he gives up 
Jockey commercials for a second, 
only this time successful, coming 
out of retirement.
Okay, maybe my anger and 
frustration is blowing this article 
a bit out of proportion, but the 
point is clearthe game will not 
be the same when it returns and 
that is what we have to look for
ward to, good or bad.
Im not saying that the general 
rules of the game will change  
90 feet, three strikes, three outs, 
nine innings, etc. are numbers 
that only blasphemous acts can 
break.
But the first area in which we 
will begin to see changes will be
among the elder ranks of player s. 
Mass retirements will become the 
norm in the next few months as 
the strike prods towards oblivion. 
Sorry, Yankee fans, but August 
1994 may be the final month in 
which Don Mattingly donned the
so on may have graced the dia
mond for the last time.
Limited financial resources of 
the owners, lack of motivation to 
stay in playing shape in case the 
strike goes on for great length, 
and an infusion of youth which
rwo ielo hSpp dUD 6o Dwo aelo hwod 
SD coDycda0 Cdg DweD Sa hweD ho we9o 
DU pUU. fUchecg DUH iUUg Uc 6eg0
famed Yankee pinstripes (no pun 
intended). Should the strike con
tinue into eternity, we should also 
expect the forthcoming retire
ments of some of the other re
vered senior citizens from whom 
the game has milked so much 
enjoyment; players such as Alan 
Trammell, Lou Whitaker, Dave 
Winfield, John Kruk, Terry 
Pendleton, Tim Wallach, Dave 
Stewart, Dennis Eckersley, and
will be inevitable once the strike 
is resolved, will all be reasons 
that keep these greats away from 
the park.
Changes wont stop there ei
ther. The last we saw baseball, 
we saw teams such as the Dodg
ers, Reds, Braves, Expos, Yan
kees, Indians, and even the sub 
.500 Rangers all enjoying suc
cess. Assuming that the minors 
continue to play in 1995, we can
expect a new slew of teams to 
take control of their divisions. 
The Kansas City Royals are on 
the verge of what could be a po
tential dynasty as a number of 
first round picks have given the 
Royals the luxury of having a 
blue-chipper at almost every 
position. Names such as Michael 
Tucker, Larry Sutton, Johnny 
Damon, Joe Vitiello, Jeff Granger, 
and Russ McGinnis are all on the 
verge of stardom. We can also 
expect the New York Mets, (thats 
right, I said the Mets) to rise 
again to the cream of the crop of 
the National League. Pitchers 
such as Bill Pulsipher, Pete 
Walker, and Chris Roberts along 
with young position players such 
as Edgardo Alfonso and Butch 
Huskey will be ready to lead a 
team which already has a new 
direction and attitude at the top.
Of course teams such as the 
Yankees and Indians will con
tinue their recent resurgences 
due to the fact that their minor
league systems are well equipped 
to withstand the damaging ef
fects of a strike. Teams that are 
contenders right now such as the 
Reds, Braves, Rangers, White 
Sox, Giants, and even marginal 
teams such as the Orioles and 
Phillies and Cardinals will suffer 
greatly from the strike due to the 
fact that any young talent they 
posses is already at the major 
league level  the players who 
are on strike!
So there you have it  the 
serious side to the oncoming 
changes that will come from the 
strike. Changes will of course 
arrive in other areas as well. Fi
nancial dealings will no longer 
look the same, television and ra
dio contracts may be redone, etc., 
but the question for now remains, 
is anybody up for going out and 
shagging a few fly balls with our 
new Velcro mitts and balls?

eddling owner, bumbling coach ruining Cowboys
xyecDoc6eM. udoe.
by John Weber
<Did you see it? Did ya? Last week, 
lowboys vs. Oilers, Troy Aikman missed 
hree consecutive passes. There was frus
tration on the faces of the Cowboys playsrs. Then it was gone. The Cowboys 
defense stamped out the Oilers offense 
and hung on for a 20-17 victory, but it 
was there. The Cowboys offense was 
iggling, and they looked around for
Jimmy Johnson and Norv Turner, but 
all they saw was an observer in the form 
of Barry Switzer. Switzer is a baby
sitter and at best a motivator. But the 
coach of the two-time defending Super 
Champions is no longer with the Cow
boy administration.
Johnson built the Cowboys, coached 
the Cowboys, and led the Cowboys to 
two Super Bowls. He was the oil that 
lubricated the Cowboy machine  a 
machine that twice defeated a very tough 
49ers team and twice dismantled a strong 
Bills team. Without Johnson, the Cow
boy machine will still run, but sooner or 
later, without oil, all machines come to a 
grinding halt. Houston was just the be
ginning. Week five the Cowboys start 
playing division rivalries; the machine 
will start to wear. Week 10 a tough 
Giant team will show up to play the 
Cowboys; the machine will start to slow.
Week 11 the Cowboys travel to Candle
stick to play the 49ers; the machine 
will...?
Dont get me wrong, I like the Cow
boys; I dont like their owner. Whether 
you like Johnson or not, he still built a 
champion, just as Bill Walsh did in the 
80s and Chuck Noll did in the 70s. In 
fact, Johnson did it a lot quicker, thanks 
to the Herschel Walker deal with Min
nesota.
However, owner Jerry Jones threw it 
all away in a New York minute. And now 
he thinks hell just throw any old college 
coach (namely Switzer) on the payroll 
and win his third Super Bowl in a row. 
Wrong! Johnsons planning and lastminute motivation can not and will not 
be replaced. The Oilers started to frus
trate the Cowboys last week and almost 
won; what is Switzer going to do in the 
playoffs when the Giants or the 49ers
start to frustrate the Cowboys and take 
a lead on the defending champions? Good 
work Mr. Jones.
Week two was okay for me  I picked 
three out of five games for a .600 batting 
average (thanks to the Chiefs, Steelers 
and Cowboys). By the way, I picked just 
under 62% of my games correctly last 
season.
rUP 8S9o ESM.a fUc 'oo. q
1. Pittsburgh at Seattle
The Seahawks have looked good lately 
so expect a hard fought game. However, 
the game isnt going to be played in the 
Kingdome, so the Steelers will be able to 
get the victory. Steelers 2qcI220
2. Miami at Minnesota
The Dolphins offense is the opposite of 
the Vikings offense. Miami will give new 
meaning to the phrase Shoot the Moon.
Based on that, give the Dolphins an easy 
victory in the dome 24-3.
3. New England at Detroit
These two teams seem to love over
time. They match up evenly. Bledsoe vs. 
Mitchell. Butts vs. Sanders. How about 
the Patriots in overtime: 30-24.
4. New Orleans at San Francisco
The Saints experiment with veteran
Jim dont call me Chris Everett is not 
working. Hey! This picking stuff is easy. 
49ers 45-10.
5. Denver at Buffalo (Monday 
Night)
Where are those people who thought 
the Broncos could go to the Super Bowl 
without defense? I know they cant win 
in Rich Stadium on Monday Night. Can 
they? Bills 35-28.

TENNESSEE, from page 7
yards, Grusky passed Joe 
Vasalani to move into sixth place 
on the Carnegie Mellon all-time 
rushing list. However, most of 
his yardage came in the first half, 
since he hurt his leg and didnt 
play in much of the second half. 
Neal finished up with 71 yards on 
three catches and a touchdown. 
Dee, however, only had to throw 
the ball 17 times, because the 
Tartans were able to get the job 
done on the ground. They fin
ished with 237 yards rushing and 
119 yards passing. Later Grusky 
told me why the running game
went so well. They didnt have a 
really good defensive plan against 
us. They seemed to want to clog 
up the middle so we bounced plays 
designed for the middle outside. 
He also said that the patented 
Tartan criss-cross play worked 
well this week. Grusky took a 
helmet hit on the right side of his 
leg, but he should be alright when 
the Tartans open up at home next 
week.
On defense, the Tartans were 
led by Morgan, who had three 
interceptions on the afternoon. 
Morgan said that Rhodes best 
receiver, Ross, was not as tough
as the Allegheny receivers last 
week and that Glorioso, the quar
terback, looked- like he didnt 
have a lot of experience. He also 
admitted that Glorioso tele
graphed some of his passes. The 
Tartan defense held the Lynx to 
240 yards total offense and only 
112 yards passing. Ross finished 
the day with seven catches for 67 
yards.
Next week the Tartans will fi
nally play at home, taking on 
Juniata College Saturday at 1:30 
pm. On Homecoming weekend, 
the Tartans will host the Mer
chant Marine Academy at 2 pm.

CMU to offer two for grant
By LESLEY KAY
recDed CaaD0 8oeDycoa mUIng0
This year Carnegie Mellon is 
joining 67 other universities 
such as Harvard, Rice, 
Dartmouth, and Cornell in 
nominating candidates for the 
Luce Scholars Program. 
Funded by the Henry Luce 
Foundation, which began in 
1967, the program exposes 
young Americans to Asian cul
ture. By spending just under 
11 months in Asia, the selected 
scholar will learn about the 
country through immersion in 
the culture as well as through 
contact with co-workers.
As Barbara Lockley, an 
H&SS advisor and a member of 
the selection committee, said, 
The goal of this program is to 
facilitate a better understand
ing of Asia and its culture for 
the future leaders of the United 
States.
In correlation with its goal, 
the Luce Scholars program, 
unlike other Asian exchange 
programs, actually requires the 
applicant not to be a specialist 
in Asian culture or studies. 
Thus, the program offers a re
markable experience to young 
Americans who would normally 
never have such an opportu
nity. Donald Sutton, a profes
sor of Chinese and Japanese 
History and also a member of 
Carnegie Mellons selection 
committee, said, Being in a 
foreign country makes you re
assess the ways youve done 
things in the past and gives you 
a new appreciation of the 
strengths of your own culture 
as well as its limitations.
The program is open to gradu
ating seniors, graduate stu
dents, and junior faculty who 
are U.S. citizens and under the 
age of 29. Furthermore, the pro
gram is searching for young 
Americans with leadership 
qualities, making academic 
achievement, community ac
tivities, and career-oriented 
activities a high priority. The 
selection process is rather rig
orous, beginning with an ini
tial screening process by each 
university, followed by a screen
ing process by the Luce Foun
dation to select no more than 
45 finalists. Then, the finalist 
are interviewed at one of three 
regional locations and 18 appli
cants are informed that they 
will be Luce scholars.
After undergoing an initial 
orientation session at Prince
ton, the 18 scholars depart to 
Asia as a group and undergo a 
second orientation in an Asian 
university. Then they depart 
for their respective assign
ments.
Living expenses are provided 
for by a grant from the Henry 
Luce Foundation. In general, 
scholars five at the same level 
of comfort as local faculty mem
bers.
In response to this program, 
Barbara Lazarus, the Associ
ate Provost for Academic 
Projects said, The Luce is a 
wonderful opportunity for our 
students or alumni to learn 
about a fascinating part of our 
world in a real and profound 
way. The Luce provides its fel
lows with thoughtful work and 
living opportunities which 
change their lives profoundly.
If you are interested in the 
Luce Scholars program, con
tact Barbara Lockley atx8-l 080

Oh, we're invading Haiti? I The only reason I know about Haiti... I really don't know enough to
dont watch T. V.  [is] because I was watching Seinfeld.  have an opinion. 
Students know little of current events
By SHANNON GEBNEY
recDed uDeffhcSDoc
Although the Pentagon was readying 
KD least 1,700 reservist troops for an 
invasion of Haiti which Defense Secre
tary Perry said would occur soon, the 
CMU community, for the most part, 
continues its long-standing tradition of 
linear (as opposed to peripheral) 
perspectivism. Many students exist in 
complete ignorance of the many prob
lems that Haiti has been dealing with 
during the past few months.
In fact, many students were 
not even aware that U.S. 
troops planned to invade the 
Caribbean country in a 
matter of days.
President Clinton an
nounced plans to invade 
, Thursday night, in a 
| televised speech to the
 nation designed to rally 
public support for this 
; action.
The speech interrupted 
the popular sitcom Seinfeld,
: which was a main reason why 
many students were aware of 
these events. The only reason I knew 
about what was going on in Haiti was 
because I was watching Senifeld, said 
Spencer Berg, sophomore H&SS stu
dent.
During the speech, Clinton stated that 
U.S. intervention and invasion are es
sential, because Haitian dictators are 
the most brutal, most violent regime 
anywhere in our hemisphere, and be
cause the U.S. and the U.-N. must follow 
| through with their course of action and 
reinstate democracy in the region.
The President also said that the U.S. 
cannot possibly sustain an influx of 
Haitian refugees in addition to the 14,000 
already residing at the U.S. naval base 
at Guantanamo, Cuba.
Although some students interviewed 
were very informed and updated about 
the invasion and the events that 
proceededit, mostwere
like McDonalds goes through french 
fries. His friend beside him asked, Oh, 
were invading Haiti? I dont watch TV. 
We wanna invade, thats all I know. I 
really dont know enough about it to 
have an opinion, another student stated. 
These were the typical responses given
admittedly ignorant and did 
not wish to be quoted.
I dont have a TV, and I dont read 
newspapers. I try to avoid politics as 
much as possible, said one student.
When questioned about his knowledge 
of the Haitian situation another student 
answered, Its a little country with a lot 
of turmoil. They go through dictators
Mark Eggert/Tartan Art Co-Editor
when people were asked what they knew 
about Haiti, and how they felt about it.
Although some atypical answers were 
given, they were, by and large, produced 
by students in the Social and Decision 
Sciences Department.
Yeah, Clinton just went on TV last
night at 9 pm to try and explain his 
rationale for why we should invade. He 
mentioned that there is too much terror 
there and that we cant just let that go 
on, said one student.
They did a survey and found that *Y 
of Americans believe that we should
invade ... Its a tricky situation because 
people are always complaining that the 
U.S. is the global police. Thats true but 
theres a moral imperative that the world 
cant just sit back and watch people die. 
Another student said, I watched most 
of his speech. I havent seen a paper yet, 
because Ive been in class. I just think
that the actions of a country should be 
the actions that the citizens desire, not 
just what the President thinks is good 
for the economy.
The History and Social and Decision 
Sciences Departments combined only 
offer about 12 classes that deal with 
current events (on a daily basis) this 
semester.
An estimated 365 students are en
rolled in them. That is roughly 8.1 per
cent of the total undergraduate popu
lation that is regularly concerned with 
events occurring outside the small, 
but very intense world of CMU. 
This number was reflected in 
the responses of the group of 
about 20 students that were 
interviewed about their 
knowledge of the Haiti 
situation.
Many knew that there had 
been trouble in the Haitian 
region for some time, and 
some knew of the threat of 
invasion.
However, a very small, num
ber actually knew the specifics of 
the situation, or about the most recent events that have occurred. Many 
freshman find that theyre so busy when 
they get here that they dont have time 
to keep up with the news, said Peter 
Steams, dean of humanities and social 
sciences.
It would suffice to say that students 
find it hard to keep up with current 
events here, as CMU prides itself on its 
competitive coursework, and singular 
emphasis that all of the colleges demand 
of their students.

Cooking tips for dormers keep on sizzling
I Zpg ked TUddoc
63 seaUd NUDw
As promised in one of those 
mangled paragraphs of last weeks 
, column, here I will address the 
basic cooking equipment for any 
I aspiring gourmet. First of^f, the 
: biggies: pots and pans. Id say a
I 10" frying pan and a 1 1/2 or 2
quart pot are the barest necessi
ties; the average recipe in this 
dolumn will be possible with 
these items.
In addition, a cookie sheet, 
muffin pan, and roasting pan 
(~13"x9") will take you out of the 
rookie league of cooks. As for 
utensils, big wooden spoons and 
a sturdy plastic spatula are the 
barest essentials, with ladle, 
slotted spoon, wire whisk, rub
ber spatula, and spaghetti spoon 
rounding out the basic field.
Measuring cups and spoons 
are handy (although the true 
cook will rarely measure out 
spices and the like), and Ive 
already mentioned the impor
tance of a cheese grater (the 
simple one-size will usually do, 
but if youve the resources, run
wild); I personally dont have a 
garlic press, but a good one is 
worthwhile.
Ive found that the ubiquitous 
Ginsu-style serrated knife sets to 
be had for maybe $10 are suffi
cient, and to that I would add a 3" 
paring knife (great for mincing 
garlic). Finally, a 1 1/2 to 2 qt. 
mixing/Tupperware bowl gives 
you someplace to make and store 
your creations.
Obviously this is an incomplete 
list and, just as obviously, you 
wont need every item here to 
cook, but these should guide your 
shopping and birthday lists, and 
will, it is hoped, save you from 
buying a 1/2 qt. saucepan when 
you still dont have a spatula. 
One last word: some scoff at 
Teflon-coated cookware, but for a
student who does dishes weekly, 
its virtually indispensable; un
coated pans are probably only 
worthwhile if gotten cheaply.
Not to leave you hungry at the 
kitchen store (if you can wrangle 
a ride to E Liberty, the Phar-Mor 
is super-cheap), Ill send you shop
ping with  what else?  a po
tato recipe, one that is absolutely 
a meal unto itself.
Potatoes-Tomatoes-andOregano
Mashed baked potato (MBP), 1/4 
small onion, olive oil, tomato (smaller 
than your potato), garlic, oregano, 
basil, parmesan cheese (grated)
Heat the oil in a frying pan and 
saut the chopped onion and
minced garlic as if beginning a 
tomato sauce; add in the spices 
(quick quiz: what spice did I not 
mention that is, nonetheless, nec
essary to the dish?), and plenty of 
em. While this is going, chop your 
MBP and throw it in. Reduce heat 
somewhat, and let the flavors 
mingle. When the potato begins 
to brown, throw in the chopped 
tomato.
Now you have two options: let 
it stew a bit and allow the tomato 
to reduce, or turn up the heat and 
quickly saut the tomato without 
really allowing it to cook. Which 
you choose depends on whether 
you want a more potato- or to
mato-oriented dish.
This leads to a possible substi
tution: canned stewed or crushed 
tomatoes are acceptable, but
watch your proportions. Speak
ing of which, the above dish i8 
rather small scale: enough for 
one or at most two. However, you 
can see that expansion is quite 
simple, and just figure out how 
much your guests would eat if 
they ate the ingredients sepa. 
rately to determine how much to 
put in. Finally, good Italian bread 
is wonderful for soaking up the 
juices.
Thats all for this week. And for 
those of you who didnt know that 
Pepper is Not Optional, youre1 
sent to a night of remedial eating 
at the Highlander (Thatll teachyou. Yuck.)

Captain Paul Watson to 
speak in Doherty Hall
By DEENA NEWSOM
recDed sydSUc uDeff hcSDoc
It all started when he protested the dissec
tion of frogs in his high school Biology class. 
From there, Captain Paul Watson went on to 
become an eco-warrior and defender of ma
rine wildlife. His radical exploits, both on land 
and the high seas, have demanded interna
tional attention for both Watson himself and 
the causes he fights for.
Born in Toronto,
Ontario, and raised in New 
Brunswick, Watson took 
to the sea early in life, 
working first as a 
dockhand on a Norwegian 
ship and later for both the 
Norwegian and Swedish 
Merchant Marines and the 
Canadian Coast Guard.
In the 1960s, Watson 
took up antiwar causes, 
and in 1969, he joined the 
Dont Make a Wave Com
mittee, which later be
came Greenpeace. During 
his time with Greenpeace, Watson took on 
several causes, including protecting baby seals 
from Norwegian hunters on the Labrador ice 
packs. The media coverage of his work there 
helped bring into homes the brutality faced by 
these animals, and opened new doors for envi
ronmental and animal rights activists.
In 1977, Watson left Greenpeace and founded 
his own organization, the Sea Shepherd Con
servation Society, which was dedicated to the 
protection of marine wildlife. They took to the 
seas on the uoe uwoPwocg, a deep-water trawler 
bought with funds donated by Cleveland 
Amory, the founder of the Fund for Animals. 
The bow of this ship was reinforced with eight
tons of concrete to facilitate the ramming of illegal 
whaling ships.
In July of 1979, the uoe uwoPwocg was confis
cated by the Portuguese government when Watson 
and his crew rammed the whaling ship uSocce0 
The government planned to turn the uoe uwoPW
wocg over to the Sierra Whaling Company as 
compensation for their lost vessel, but Watson, 
rather than have his ship used for whaling, snuck 
aboard, sabotaged the ship, and sank it to the 
bottom of the harbour. Undeterred, he returned to 
the sea the next year on the uoe uwoPwocg 770
Although Watson has 
received constant criti
cism concerning his tac
tics, he believes them to 
be necessary and suc
cessful. According to 
Watson, by 1990 the ef
forts of the Sea Shep
herd Conservation Soci
ety had been responsible 
for saving tens of thou
sands of whales, hun
dreds of thousands of
______________________ dolphins, and millionsEric Watts/Tartan Artist ofgeals
Watsons activities have not been restricted to 
the sea alone. He has also taken part in the 
spiking of trees to prevent logging and the protest 
of government-sponsored wolf-killing programs.
Watson has dedicated, and in fact risked, his life 
in the fight to preserve the environment and the 
creatures that inhabit it. He has spread his mes
sage through lectures given throughout North 
America and Europe.
He has also authored three books, including his 
autobiography, uoe uwoPwocgH k3 8SiwD fUc 'wepoa

Watson will be speaking to the campus commu
nity on Tuesday, September 27, in Doherty Hall 
2210 at 8:00 pm.
Dance explores culture

Celebrating Ganesha Chaturti, 
the birth of the Lord Ganesha, 
University of Pittsburghs chap
ter of the Hindu Students Coun
cil (HSC) gathered on September 
16 for a night of festivity. The 
program included a prayer cer
emony in the name of Ganesha, 
and ended with a lively Dandia, 
an energetic Indian folk dance 
performed with sticks, beat in 
time to music.
The driving force behind the 
evening was the HSC, an inter
nationally based organization run 
mainly by second generation stu
dents of Hindu origin. It is the 
largest youth organization of In
dian origin outside of India, said 
Srikanta Mookeijee, a member 
of the University of Pittsburghs 
chapter which has been active 
since last fall.
Originated in May of1990, the 
organization now has 35 chap
ters in the U.S. As a movement 
towards the betterment of soci
ety through the spread of Hindu 
cultural awareness, it is the only 
youth group represented across 
North America operating on the 
ideal, Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, meaning the entire cre
ation is one family.
Mookerjee noted that Hindu
ism is not just a religion, but a 
culture and a heritage which can 
benefit all that are exposed to its 
richness. The goal is not just to 
preserve from within, but to edu
cate others. A main concern of 
Indians living in America today 
is the extent to which its youth

will carry on Hindu values and 
tradition; the work of the HSC 
assures that the children of 
todays youth will be able to expe
rience the heritage of their par
ents and grandparents as well as 
successfully pass it on to their 
own children. Members of the 
HSC hope that programs like the 
one held Friday night will help 
achieve that goal.
The numerous activities tak
ing place on the Pitt campus run 
from Yoga classes, soon to re
sume for the fall semester, to 
discourses on Hindu scriptures 
such as the Bhagavad Gita and 
the Ramayana, both of which not 
only provide insight to basis of 
the religion but to Indian history 
as well.
The chapter also hosts the cel
ebration of Hindu festivals yearround, from Diwali (the festival 
of lights), to Pongal and Holi. 
They have held two dandia 
dances, the second of which took 
place at the Ganesha Chaturti.
The next upcoming event on 
the agenda is the groups 
Navaratri function, on October 
29, taking place at the WPU as
sembly room. These events not 
only show a glimpse of Hindu 
culture to those who are unfamil
iar, but also give Hindu students 
a chance to interact with one an
other. Soup kitchens and other 
social projects are also supported 
by the HSC.
On a national level, the HSC 
hosts an annual camp which pro
vides an opportunity for students
of all backgrounds to learn from 
each other. Striving to achieve 
Sarve Api Sukhina Santu Sarve 
Santu Nuramayah  let everyone be happy, healthy and blessed 
 the camp is designed for spiri
tual, intellectual and physical de
velopment.
Wanting to address issues af
fecting the role of Hindus in 
America, the group has started a 
Hindu Womens Project along 
with activities promoting envi
ronmental awareness  an ideal 
beset in the Hindu religion and 
way of life.
By creating a general under
standing of Hindu culture and its 
beliefs, the HSC hopes to bridge 
the gap between the various reli
gions throughout the world. Quot
ing James Madison, Mookeijee 
said that the diversity of reli
gion is the best protection of reli
gion itself. Mookeijee also hopes 
to start a chapter of the HSC at 
Carnegie Mellon due to a grow
ing interest shown by many stu
dents.
Presently a member of the Pitt 
chapter, CMU student Bhaskar 
Bhave finds the organization to 
be an instrumental tool that* 
teaches second generation Hin
dus about their culture and also 
gives [the students] an opportu
nity to teach others about Hin
duism.
Anyone interested in becoming 
involved in the various activities 
of the HSC should contact 
Srikanta Mookerjee at (412) 372- 
3872 or snmst2@pitt.edu.

In a laddergram. the object 
is to transform the word 
on the top rung into the 
word on the bottom rung 
in the least number of 
steps. During each step 
you must replace one 
letter in the previous word 
so that a new word is 
formed. but without 
changing the positions of 
the other letters. For 
example, we can change 
LEAD into GOLD in just 
three steps: LEAD, LOAD, 
GOAD. GOLD.

Hocus pocus: ^agic casts its
By RICHARD SMOLEN What Sa this game?
recDed sydSUc uDeffhcSDoc
sped over ClMiU community
j
ike Holiday knows 
games. Hes worked 
at Games Unlimited 
in Squirrel Hill for 
seven years; hes been actively 
gaming for 15 years. Hes seen 
games come; hes seen them go. 
Yet about the game Magic he 
says, Its the best game Ive ever 
seen.
Magic: The Gathering is the 
hottest innovation to hit the gamring industry in years. Its a collectible-card fantasy game, sort 
of a cross between baseball cards 
and Dungeons and Dragons (D & 
D). Magic is completely portable, 
and playable in 30 minutes, un
-like the many hours it normally 
takes to play through a D&D cam
paign.
Magic has the simplicity of paper-rock-scissors but uses instead 
dragons, goblins, and skeletons 
the stuff of fantasy worlds. Its 
colorful and fast-paced. Its bet
ter than meDa0I
 The best game Ive ever seen 
may be a strong statement, but 
since Magic came out in August 
J993, it has had a strong impact, 
faking over Games Unlimited and 
the rest of the gaming world. 
Holiday estimates that over half 
of his business is now Magic re
lated, and he knows that compet.'tog companies are hurting.
' Some business comes from 10- 
year-olds, some from old-timers 
(ike himself (hes 35), but mostly 
it is high school and college kids 
who are into Magic. Among his 
repeat customers, Holiday singles 
out this years freshman class at 
you guessed it  CMU.t
 Youve seen them around, Im 
Ure- Magic can be played any
where. You dont need much of a 
fathering: two players, two decks
 of Magic cards, and a table suf> fice.
Magic is usually played headto-head, though it can be a multi
player game. The object is to kill 
off your opponent before he kills 
you. Your weapons are creatures 
and magic spells; your ammuni
tion is mana (magic).
Players assemble a deck of 
Magic cards at home. This is the 
strategy part of the game: when 
constructing a deck, a player must 
keep in mind which cards work 
well together, as well as the opti
mum ratio of various cards to 
others.
Since the decks are shuffled 
before play begins, the outcome 
of the game rests largely on luck 
and, to a lesser extent, on who 
has better cards.
Monster and spell cards nor
mally cost mana to play. Mana 
are units of leiSM, hence the 
name.
Land cards (swamps, moun
tains, etc.) give you mana. There 
are cards that affect other cards, 
making monsters stronger, spells 
less effective, and much, much 
more; these are the special ef
fects upon which this game re
lies. Theres not much of a plot, 
however, to speak of.
In D & D, emphasis is placed on 
imagination. In a low-lit room, 
surrounded by paper, pencils, and 
dice, players collectively gather 
in a many-hours-long thoughtexercise in problem solving.
At the same time, players cre
ate a narrative with characters 
that are alive, characters en
dowed with human needs and 
emotions, characters fully real
ized, not on paper in strength 
and intelligence scores but in the 
mind.
But in Magic there is no prob
lem solving. There is no imagina
tion. The art on each card is 
colorful  the artist for each 
card is given credit, evenbut it
leaves nothing to be imagined.
Magic is to D & D what televi
sion is to radio: something is lost 
along the way. At least you dont 
have to think to play Magic. You 
dont have to do your homework. 
It is progress, isnt it?
Why Magic?
The allure of magic lies not in 
the fact that its a fantasy game
 or even a very fun game  but 
that its a collectible-card game, 
the first of its kind. In fact, Magic 
is pure marketing genius, a truly 
American product. And the play
ers never go on strike.
But the dollar amounts, like 
baseball salaries, are astound
ing.
The basic starter pack of 40 
cards doesnt cost much, around 
eight dollars. Booster packs, 
packs of 15 cards that enhance 
the starter pack, dont cost much 
either. Until you get hooked.
Mike Holiday says that cus
tomers come in, expecting to buy 
one, maybe two, booster packs. 
So they buy one and open it. There 
are some pretty cool cards. So 
they buy another. More cool cards. 
Then they buy another.... Holi
day has sold over 40 packs of 
cards to a single customer this 
way.
As he was telling me this, a 
little 10-year-old boy walked into 
buy a booster pack of Magic cards. 
Why do you play Magic? I asked 
him. Because its really fun, he 
answered as he studied the cards 
he just bought. But so is running 
around in yards. And true to 
form he dashed out of the store 
and up Murray Avenue.
So theyve finally made gam
bling legal for 10-year-olds, I 
thought. Kids still cant pull a 
slots handle or bet on roulette, 
but they can do the next best 
thing: buy a pack of Magic cards 
andhope for ajackpot. But theres
more: Every couple of months, 
Wizards of the Coast, Inc., the 
company that makes Magic, re
leases a limited edition set with 
special, never-before-seen cards. 
There have been four of these 
expansion sets to date; they were 
all sellouts within a week.
The most recent of these, a set 
called The Dark, was selling not 
by the pack, but by the box, at 
Games Unlimited. It would have 
been sold out in two days, said 
Mike Holiday, had the store not 
limited quantities. Even then, it 
barely lasted a week.
This scarcity in cards makes 
them valuable. Cards from previ
ous sets can sell for upwards of 
$30. Unlike baseball cards, there 
is no waiting for the cards to 
become valuable. The cards are 
already severely limited in num
ber, and they are usually more 
powerful than the normal cards
that come in starter and booster 
packs. So every few months these 
new, powerful cards come out,
and collectors and players gobble 
them up. The next expansion set 
is scheduled to come out right 
before Christmas.
Ben Peal, a junior history ma
jor, was fascinated by the collec
tor aspect of Magic long before he 
had any liking for the game itself. 
He sold some of his friends cards 
as a favor  and wound up with 
$250 for himself. The cards had 
sold for triple what his friend had 
paid for them. This is not un
common at all, says Peal.
Magic is a real speculator phe
nomenon, Peal continues. He 
told me about a man who bought 
$8,000 worth of cards for the ex
pansion set Legends when it was 
released. A few weeks later, with 
not a single pack of Legends to be 
found in any store, the man was
able to resell the cards for $16,000. i
There are many who spend hun- !
dreds, even thousands of dollars 
on Magic cards.
But why? Peal says that he i
started to find Magic fun with the !
added variety of the expansion I
sets. There is a certain thrill, he !
says, in being able to stack your I
own deck.
Rob Verenna, an H&SS fresh- i
man, agrees that the game is '
pretty addicting. But why? Its i
something to kill time, he says, i
searching for an answer. He likes j
the game enough to have bid for 
over $50 worth of cards in a Magic 
card auction taking place over a j
CMU bulletin board. Rob says j
that it is a social game, that you ;
can play a few short games with j
a stranger, and that it is pretty 
easy to meet people that way.
Most players like the portabil- :
ity of the game. All you need to j
carry with you is a deck of cards, ;
after all. David Raynor, a fresh
man ECE major, notes that kids 
can take them to school and play 
during lunch hours.
When I was in school, I owned 
a portable chess set. Why not 
chess? I naively asked. David ; 
responded that the attraction in ; 
Magic was that it is new. It is a 
new game, there are always new 
cards, you never play the same ' 
game twice  and Magic is castingits spell on new players all the 
time.
The New
The game Magic embodies 
Faustian desire if ever anything 
did, and Wizards of the Coast, 
Inc. will be making incredible 
amounts of money in the next few 
years. The occasional expansion 
set will promise salvation to mobs 
of Magic players who will snatch 
up truckloads of boxes of packs of 
cards, searching for that Udo that

Wizards of the Coast, Inc. have 
come out with another card 
game, Jyhad, which is growing in 
popularity amidst older players. 
Its more complicated than 
Magic, and there are more 
elements involved. The best way

The Gathering Field rocks
By JASON ANDRACKI
recDed uDeffhcSDoc
Throughout the pitchblack room, the 
air was filled with the hum of an electric 
guitar and the haunting words of Dylan 
Thomas. The lights rose as rwo -eDwocW
Sdi 8Sopg kicked into Dylan Thomas 
Days on the Decade stage Saturday 
night. The crowd excitedly greeted the 
bands opening song.
For most of rwo -eDwocSdi 8Sopg'a set 
of acoustic and electric folk rock, it was 
near impossible to tell who was enjoying 
themselves more, those onstage or those 
in the crowd. Bill Deasy and company, 
visibly pleased with the size of the crowd 
and the first recorded effort, followed 
Dylan Thomas Days with Looking at 
the Sun. After that tune, Deasy set 
aside his acoustic guitar and left the 
guitar chores completely up to Dave 
Brown and concentrated solely on sing
ing my personal favorite, Information. 
Both men responded well to their new 
positions as they demonstrated to the 
crowd that they could sound even better 
live than on CD.
After a few less familiar tunes, Deasy 
and company chose the ninth track from
their first release, I Believe, I Believe. 
Deasy introduced the next song, Rough 
Road by saying, Its about sex ... Im 
pro-sex, to the laughing group that gath
ered at the Decade.
On a more serious note, Sweet Thing 
was dedicated to Deasys parents. Con
tinuing their collaboration from the re
cording of the debut disc, Liz Berlin of 
NyaDog NUUD joined the group for this 
song. Berlin also added her backing vo
cals to Bordertown, Slightly Aimless, 
and Everythings Alright. Slightly 
Aimless was a true crowd pleaser as 
fans toasted each other and the band as 
they swayed to the lyrics. You could tell 
the hometown crowd appreciated Deasy 
sticking to his roots as they erupted in 
cheers for the line Walking home along 
Frankstown Road.
rwo -eDwocSdi 8Sopg continued to pro
vide a variety of songs as they mixed 
One Way or Another, Love Me Good, 
and Bound to Be, in with the tracks 
from the CD, That Night, Better Off 
Without Me, and Lost It In the Sun. 
Following these tunes, the band took a 
little break and gave Deasy all of the 
spotlight for the first few verses of Bob 
Dylans Like A Rolling Stone. This was
another crowd favorite with Deasys 
words being much more distinguishable 
than Dylans. During this cover, Deasy 
said, This feels really good, and that 
this new band is going to go far. Its 
gonna make your head spin!
At the end ofthe set, the crowd wanted 
more, so rwo -eDwocSdi 8Sopg obliged 
with two encores. One that was about, 
how women in general mistreat men, 
which Deasy dedicated to his friend that 
drove all the way from Massachusetts 
for the show. Following the two encores 
the group did end the show but still 
stuck around as long as they could to 
sign autographs and mingle with fans 
and loved ones alike.
With the release party for their self
titled first album, which will be avail
able at National Record Marts begin
ning Tuesday, rwo -eDwocSdi 8Sopg 
proved that they can record great music 
and play it even more impressively live.
This new band on the Pittsburgh mu
sic scene got a very warm reception from 
a packed house at the Decade. Check 
them out!

leDSUd e6UyD The Gathering Field.
One-on-one with Bill Deasy
The origins of the name "The Gather- time in the spotlight. He also led Shiloh,
ing Field are, accordingto Deasy, rooted 
in "desperation. It's harder than you 
think to think up a good name. Paula 
[DiGtoia (Deasys girlfriend)] liked the 
word gathering and Dave [Brown (the 
producer and guitarist for the group)] 
liked field." The two words were com
bined and The Gathering Field was offi
cially born.
Deasy, a Penn Hills native, decided he 
wanted to be a musician when Elvis 
Presley caught his attention in firstgrade. 
By third grade he was buying a different 
single by the "King every week, and he 
received his first guitar lessons to go 
with it. Deasy, who wrote all the lyrics for 
the first album, wrote his first song in 
sixth grade titled Shes a Big Jerk. 
Instead ofthe cruelty of girls in their early 
teens Deasy's current influences are 
whatever I'm listening to right now.
His current favorites such as Freedy 
Johnson and John Hiatt plus another all 
time favorite, Van Morrison tend to filter 
through my own writing.  Deasy was very 
flatteredtobe described as Pittsburghs 
answer to John Hiatt" in a recent In 
Pittsburgh article.
The Gathering Re/d is not Deasys first
the winning group from 1991s Graffitti 
Rock Challenge, plus formed the Bill 
Deasy Group.
Following those groups Deasy spent 
some time in Nashville under the tute
lage of the Corbin-Hammer country hit 
writers.
Deasy's extensive connections in the 
Pittsburgh music scene paid off when it 
was time to record. The disc features Li? 
Berlin and Jim DiSpirlto from Rusted 
Root and Scott Biasey of the Clarks on 
background vocals. Such collaboration 
is uncommon, although it should hap
pen a lot more. The Pittsburgh music 
scene is too competitive."
With plans to tour throughout New 
England and a recent appearance on 
WDVEs Morning Coffeehouse perform
ing "Bordertown, Deasy and The Gath
ering Field are definitely going places. 
They will also be entering the studio 
again in December.
Be sure to check out Deasy, along with 
members of the Clarks in the tent on 
Monday night at 8 pm. Also The Gather
ing Field will be back on campus for 
Homecoming on Saturday, October 1 at 
7:30 pm.

Welcome to the second install
ment of File 13. First off, Id like 
to thank my readers... you know 
who you are. I have had lots of

that. If you know of any fine films

downright cool magical abilities. 
This is a good movie to watch if 
you have a high tolerance of stu
pidity, and, as a bonus, you get to 
see Robert Downey Jr. wear a bra 
on his head.
uS\Dood medgpoa is only slightly 
more realistic; if you can believe 
that a 16 year old girl (Molly

now? Most of these brat packers disappeared long ago.
subject line like File 13 so I 
know what Im getting into.
From time to time I will digress 
from the usual format, and this 
installment is the first. I apolo
gize to all of you who were excited 
about the column on bad musi
cals; I will be runningthat article 
next week. I just couldnt pass 
this one up. Its almost a once in 
a lifetime opportunity.
Anyone who grew up in the 80s 
will remember back to 1986, be
fore John Hughes realized that 
he could cash in on cute little kids 
in madcap plots. No, because back 
then, he was cashing in on cute 
adolescent kids in madcap plots.
Hughes was making movies 
about atypical teenagers, and 
their daily atypical lives, and, of 
course, the rather atypical she
nanigans that they would go 
through in the course of a few 
days. These were called the Brat 
Pack films. Their stars were the 
Brat Packers.
Unlike most typical American 
high school students, Brat Pack
ers never had acne, were good 
looking, had no trouble finding 
the perfect mate, and actually 
knew more than their parents 
did (about anything). They also 
had cool cars, in most cases.
I am mentioning this, because, 
as some of you may have noticed, 
there are TWO Brat Pack films 
playing on campus DwSa hoo.odg! 
But well get to that soon enough.
Heres the list of Brat Pack 
flicks.
Brat Pack Comedies:
'oScg uMSodMo is a tme test of 
how much you can stand cinematically. The plot, if you havent 
seen it, is this: two high-school
Michael Hall).
Unfortunately, its not as 
watchable. The problem with this 
movie is that I didnt understand 
the humor when it first came out; 
then, when I was a teenager, I 
was embarrassed by it; now, as a 
young adult, I dont understand 
why I watched it, and Im embar
rassed that I did.
8occSa Oyoppofa Te3 Zff is the 
best of the Brat Pack comedies, in 
my opinion. Mainly, because its 
funny. The others are more stu
pid and moronic than humorous, 
but this one is actually fun to 
watch. The acting isnt too bad, 
and the movie is almost believ
able. Theres actually some good 
writing, too.
Brat Pack Dramas:
uUlo RSdg Uf 'Udgocfyp is my 
favorite of the Brat Pack drama 
flicks... and I mean this honestly. 
I dont mean that I think its the 
best in terms of how bad it is, it is 
really the most decent of the genre 
(Of course, I could be just partial 
to Lea Thompson, but thats an
other story).
The acting is very good, and 
there seems to be some actual 
sincerity in it. Its still a far cry 
from reality, but its a lot closer 
than the others to choose from.
The basic plot: Eric Stoltz (rwo 
8p3 77& develops a crush on Lea 
Thompson COeM. DU Dwo 8yDyco&0 
Of course, shes rich, and he works 
repairing cars, so its bad news. 
His tomboy friend, played by 
Mary Stuart Masterson (7lloW
gSeDo 8elSp3H 8cSog -cood rUleW
DUoa&H helps him out in his con
quest.
EcoDD3 Sd ESd. is very close to 
the plot of uUlo RSdg Uf 'UdgocW
fyp0 Molly Ringwald, the not-sorich kid in this one, falls for 
Andrew McCarthy ('oo.odg eD 
OocdSoa&H the rich kid. James 
Spader uo\H /SoaH edg vSgoUDePo& 
plays his shallow rich-kid friend. 
This ones really syrupy and for
mulaic, and the best part of it is 
the fact that it spumed the OMD 
single If You Leave, which soon 
became a staple of all junior high 
school dances.
The Definitive Brat Pack 
film:
rwo Ocoe.feaD mpy6H no doubt 
about it. It is the definitive Brat 
Pack flick for several reasons: 
one, it stars both Molly Ringwald 
(as the rich girl... hows that for 
breakingthe mold?) and Anthony 
Michael Hall (Guess who he 
plays?). The rest of the cast is 
made up of Ally Sheedy (uwUcD 
mScMySD&H Judd Nelson (8cUl Dwo 
,SP&H and Emilio Estevez (NoPU 
ked&0 They are, respectively, the 
shy girl, the rebel, and the ath
lete.
Secondly, its a comedy/drama. 
Which means, of course, that 
there are alternating scenes of 
teen angst and bad teen humor.
Finally, its the only Brat Pack 
flick with Judd Nelson. Where is 
he nowadays? The last thing I 
saw him in was rwo Tec. OeM.W
hecg, a movie about a comedian 
that grows an extra arm out of his 
back. Was rwo Ocoe.feaD mpy6 
the first step to the end of his 
career?
Its definitely not as believable 
as the other Brat Pack dramas, 
but more believable than the 
other Brat Pack comedies (with 
the possible exception of 8occSa&0 
But, with the largest true Brat 
Pack cast, this is the ultimate 
film in the genre. The best scene: 
Judd Nelson shoves his bag of pot 
down Anthony Michael Halls 
pants. A truly great moment in 
cinema history!
And now, our feature pre
sentation:
Under the suggestion of my 
roomate Nate Segerlind, we have 
decided that it would be a much 
cooler experience for everyone in 
attendance if we all really got 
into it. So, unofficially (of course 
... I dont have the clout to spon
sor anything for real), if you hap
pen to come to a showing of rwo 
Ocoe.feaD mpy6 at, oh, say 10 
oclock, you might actually be 
dressed like your favorite Brat 
Packer.
You might be, of course. I dont 
know for a fact; like I say, I dont 
have the ability to set up these 
sorts of random, chance happen
ings, in which large numbers of 
people attend dressed like char
acters in the film.
So I guess Ill see you there. Oh, 
by the way: does anybody have a 
denim jacket that I could borrow?

Time Cop does not disappoint
By DAN GOLDWASSER
recDed uDeffhcSDoc
rSlo mUPH starring Jean-Claude Van Damme 
and Ron Silver is a fun, entertaining film which 
was released in theaters last Friday.
It is 2004. Time travel is a reality, and someone 
is using it for evil purposes. Walker (Van Damme) 
is a special officer who is part of a covert govern
ment agency whose sole purpose is to keep time 
from changing. Through the course of his mis
sions, he discovers that a Senator running for 
President (Silver) has been going back in time 
and stealing to fund his campaign.
Mia Sara is Walkers wife, who was killed in 
1994 by a team of unknown assailants. Walker 
still has a chance to save her but will it cost him 
the world as he knew it?
This was a film that would disappoint nobody. 
If you want drama, it has it. Romance; well, its 
not the highlight, but its there. And of course, 
action, action, action. This is, after all, the essen
tial element in a Van Damme film. While some 
people might find the violence a bit much, it did
add to the film in its own, unique way.
This film is a detective story with a twist. We 
know who did it, but can it be proved? Time travel 
makes things hard to find, especially when some
one is trying to cover their tracks. This brings up a 
few issues about the dangers of time travel, and 
what could happen if it were to fall into the wrong 
hands.
It was mentioned in the beginning that if some
one went back in time to kill Hitler, it might have 
an effect which could destroy mankind. When 
dealing with a paradox things can get pretty con
fusing (think about roclSdeDUc 2 for a bit), so it is 
best to put most of your realistic thought aside, and 
enjoy the film.
Directed by Peter Hyams 2XVXH rwo EcoaSgSU), 
rSlo mUP is a movie which shows that while Van 
Damme still has a problem with his English, he

Frears films shown at The Carnegie
By WLADIMIR 
LABEIKOVSKY
recDed sydSUc uDeffhcSDoc
Behold, all you fans of farce 
and realism (yes, it is supposed 
to sound ambiguous), the 
Carnegie Museum of Artis show
ing a comprehensive series of 
films by Brit.-turned-auteur 
Stephen Frears.
Although hes probably better 
known for his latest films TedW
iocUya /SeSaUdaH rwo -cSfDoca&H 
Frears started making TV mov
ies in England in the late 60s 
where he acquired a taste for 
naturalism that still holds as a 
characteristic of most of his films.
From his earlier film features 
rwo ,SDH 1984), Frears showed 
a natural skill at portraying situ
ations of pathos and moralism 
without making his films essen
tially psychological or preachy. 
Frears manages to create a com
plex subtext out of an otherwise 
common story.
After rwo ,SDH Frears teamed 
up with screenwriter Hanif 
Kureishi to make two of his most 
famous early films: k3 OoeyDSW
fyp /eydgcoDDo (1985), and 
uell3 edg NUaSo -oD /eSg 
(1987) where he introduced him
self as a more audacious and 
darker portrayer of society, these 
two films evolved as tales of cul
tural and sexual politics in 
Thatcher England, with all the 
conflict implied.
Next he moved on to an even 
more audacious terrain with 
EcSM. bP 5Uyc neca (1987) a film 
about the life of controversial 
playwright Joe Orton (portrayed 
by Gary Oldman).
These films established him 
as a marginal director of rebel
lious spirit, a calification he pre
fers to decline. Most Frears films 
have a rather ambiguous point 
of view, and as Frears himself 
said, I always find that what
ever I say, I can say the oppo
site.
Not that hed prefer to be con
sidered an auteur either, his films 
dont have the technical fireworks 
nor the typically dazzling visu
als of say, Ridley Scott or Ken 
Russell. As I said, his are essen
tially realist films, his urban sto
ries have enough grit to almost 
feel it, but still, he avoids 
effectism, This is what Britain is 
like, it has to be simple ... people 
used to think wed shot our films 
on the street just as we found 
them. Indeed, thats what Frears 
does best.
However, after that, Frears 
moved on to bigger films, the ac
claimed TediocUya /SeSaUda 
(1988) was his first film with US 
actors and showed that he had 
not lost his uncanny touch on
it starred John Cusack as a 
small-time con man in shady 
conflict with colleague Annette 
Benning and colleague-mother 
Anjelica Houston who portrays 
the mother capable of giving 
nightmares to Freud.
His next and most main
stream film, ,ocU (1992), a nod 
to Frank Capra but with lots of 
satire) didnt have as much suc
cess as his previous films and 
Frears seems to have gone back 
to his days of realism with the 
British comedy rwo udePPoc 
(1994), which deals with the 
troubles an Irish family has to 
go though when the teenage 
daughter is going to have a 
snapper (Irish slang for baby, 
it seems). While we hope he

casting. Even when presented 
with the possibility of making a 
typically fatuous period film, 
Frears opted to focus in tight shots 
and performances, his style re
maining basically the same. Al
ways an admirer of American cin
ema, Frears decided it was time 
to go west. His first incursion in 
genre, the Scorsese-produced rwo 
-cSfDoca (1990), was an essentially 
noir film (with a few tributes 
thrown in) with touches of Greek 
tragedy.
Considered one of his best films,
doesnt quite leave us yet, we 
can get to see most of Frears 
work through this film series.

Mad Max
The future will be a horrible place. There will be 
huge trucks running around on the road and a 
group of children out in the desert generally enjoy
ing 747s and lots of guns and mayhem. At least 
thats what George Miller, director of Mad Max, 
wants you to think.
Starring Mel Gibson and Roger Ward, this 1979 
film is an action shoot-em-up that was Australias 
highest grossing film. Complete with dangerous 
thugs and cute little girls who get shot at, this film 
has it all. See it. Its a steal at twice the price.
At 6, 8,10 pm and midnight.
Friday, September 23
The Breakfast Club
The generation-defining movie of the eighties, 
The Breakfast Club is the story of a group of 
trouble-makers who end up making friends in 
detention. This gripping story is seasoned by the 
tantalizing Emilio Estevez, the luscious Molly 
Ringwald, and carmelized by the directing of John 
Hughes.
Also starring Ally Sheedy, Judd Nelson and 
Anthony Michael Hall, this film is a virtual whos 
who of teen angst movies. If you have the urge to 
break out your Duran Duran and watch how the 
JDs live, this film is for you.
At 6, 8,10 pm and midnight.
Saturday, September 24
Some Kind of Wonderful
This movie is about love and related themes. 
Directed by Howard Deutch in 1987, this movie 
stars Eric Stoltz, Mary Stuart Masterson, and Lea 
Thompson, making it the perfect follow-up to The 
Breakfast Club. A story about how a girl 
(Masterson) loves a boy (Stoltz), who loves a girl 
(Thompson), Some Kind of Wonderful retraces the 
ground broken by such wonderful films as Lucas 
and Sixteen Candles.
As movies go, this one isnt too terribly bad. 
Romantic and funny, its a steal at thrice the price. 
But put away your Duran Duran before you go.
At 6, 8,10 pm and midnight.

Mad Magician(in 3-D)
From House of Wax to Citizen Kane, the words 
In 3-D have been used to bolster the ticket sales 
of otherwise slow moving movies. Im not saying 
this is one of those, but I would assume it is.
Starring Eva Gabor and Vincent Price, this movie 
is about a magician who is mad. He kills other 
magicians and then impersonates them. The kill
ing part is the mad part of the title. And Vincent 
Price plays the magician, which would make him 
The Mad Magician. The logic is impeccable. So is 
the movie.
At 6, 8,10 pm and midnight.

Laugh with Black Hat
By BETHANY SUTTON
recDed uDeffhcSDoc
Looking for a raunchy, outrageous comedy that will keep you 
roaring until they roll the final credits? Or would you prefer a more 
serious, intellectual film, laced with just the right amount of 
sociopolitical criticism? Cant decide? Then be sure to check out 
Rusty Cundieff s new flick, 8oec Uf e OpeM. ,eD, playing at the 
Beehive in Oakland.
Billed as a lewd, laugh-out-loud spoof that compares to rwSa Sa 
uPSdep rePHA 8oec Uf e OpeM. ,eD is an exciting combination of both 
raw humor and biting satire. Produced in cinma vrit form, 
writer and director Cundieff makes excellent use of documenta
ries techniques in depicting a year in the life of the fictional rap 
group NWH (Niggaz With Hat).
The film is narrated by Nina Blackburn, the young, attractive 
black feminist filmmaker who accompanies the rappers on tour
and into their 
homes.
Her interviews 
with NWH range 
from sublimity to 
ludicrousness; for 
example, when 
Blackburn ques
tions the political 
significance of one 
of their most sexu
ally explicit hits, 
Ice launches into 
a ridiculously 
complicated, 
drawn-out expla
nation with as 
many holes as 
Swiss cheese.
Yet the treat
ment of the issue of censorship is far from one-sided; just one of a 
multitude of hot topics approached by the film, it is repeatedly 
examined and condemned.
Eventually, the group is forced to either surrender their freedom 
of speech or join a more progressive label, obviously choosing the 
latter.
Such issues as racism and sexism are dealt with by presenting 
the extremes of mainstream societys stereotypes; personified 
strongly by the members of NWH, this method forces us, the 
viewing public, to laugh both at the film and at ourselves, as well 
as enable us to re-examine our often very ridiculous assumptions 
and fears.
Ice Cold, portrayed by Cundieff, embodies a variety of negative 
stereotypes: hes a sex-crazed black man, the father of several 
illegitimate children, and he is deft at the art of deception and 
deceit.
Fellow rapper Tasty Taste (Larry B. Scott), former retailer in 
pharmaceutical distribution, represents the height of black 
militancy; in one scene, he takes Blackburn to the basement of his 
multi-million dollar mansion in the Hills to show off an arsenal 
replete with enough Uzis, bazookas, and assault rifles to conquer 
a small country.
Finally, there is Tone Def (Mark Christopher Lawrence); slow 
and overweight, he is the epitome of ignorance, whose usually 
nonsensical attempts at philosophical profundity often serve as 
the butt of Ice and Tastes jokes.
Supporting members of the cast also provide snippets of stereo
typical extremes: a flamboyant gay choreographer, LAPD cops 
who use Rodney King-esque interrogation, and a white music 
producer who fails miserably in his attempts to be hip.
Cundieff spares nothingin this provocative new film. With guest 
appearances by M.C. Slammer and Vanilla Sherbert, superb 
character acting and smart dialogue makes 8oec Uf e OpeM. ,eD one 
of the funniest films of the year.

Fine feathered friends entertain at the Aviary
mcySaSd Dwo Oyciw
by Christina Farrell
Since the beginning of Septem

has been celebrating National 
Chicken Month.
My boyfriend and I decided to 
share his spirit and spend some 
time with our fine feathered 
friends at The National Aviary.

For More Information
The National Aviary: (412) 321-1 FLY
While there werent any chick
ens, The Aviary was filled with 
birds of every color, shape, and 
size.
I would highly recommend a 
visit to this national treasure.
The Aviary is the only indoor 
bird facility, independent of a 
larger zoo, in North America.
For this reason, it was titled 
The National Aviary in October. 
It holds 450 birds from around 
the world, including 15 endan
gered or threatened species.
In coordination with the Spe
cies Survival Program, they also 
breed endangered birds, such as 
the red-crowned Crane, so that 
they may be returned to their 
natural habitat.
We were greeted in the lobby 
by a volunteer worker and a tem
peramental  yet certainly en
tertaining parrot named Mac.
The worker attempted to tell 
us about the Aviary, but Mac 
insisted on being the center of 
attention.
I think he thinks his name is 
No, she said as he bit her hand, 
because thats all we ever tell 
him.
The displays range from large 
rooms where the birds fly directly 
overhead and walk along the 
same pathway as the visitors, to 
individual indoor and outdoor dis
plays focusing on a certain type of 
bird or habitat.
Among the birds we saw were 
two of the forty-nine remaining 
Micronesian kingfish
ers, and the only pair 
of blue-winged kook
aburras in North 
America. My personal 
favorite, however, was 
Mickey, the talking 
crow.
Although he sat 
next to a sign that 
read, Please excuse 
my appearance, Im 
molting, he undoubt
edly out-shined even 
the parrots in elo
quence.
With an almost-human voice, Mickey 
asked repeatedly, 
How, what, where, 
why?
Clearly, the term 
bird-brain does not 
apply here.
After seeing all the 
displays, instead of 
jumping back into the 
car and wasting a beautiful day 
on school work, we took a walk 
around West Park which sur
rounds the Aviary.
Besides a lake and tennis 
courts, we discovered a Pitts
burgh tradition  Gus and 
Yiayias.
On the Northside Since Your 
Dad was a Lad, is the motto 
painted on the little red cart that 
has been in the same spot selling 
popcorn, peanuts, and hand-chis
eled ice balls every day since 1934. 
A definite stop before leaving the 
north side.

The Batman Adventures brings back memories, creates nostalgia for Saturday morning cartoons of childhood
mUlSM OUU. mwcUdSMpoa
by Jason Andracki
Similar to rwo Ikod Cg9odDycoa from 
Marvel and Images forthcoming'Spgm C0 r0a 
Cg9odDycoa (drastically unique names, 
wouldnt you say?), DCs rwo OeDled 
Cg9odDycoa is based on its characters 
cartoon exploits.
What puts rwo OeDled Cg9odDycoa 
head and shoulders above the others?
Rather than simply adapt the ani
mated adventures to the comic book 
medium, rwo OeDled Cg9odDycoa fea
tures original stories outside of the con
tinuity of DCs other Bat-books, with art 
styled after the art noir of OeDledF rwo 
CdSleDog uocSoa0
Although this book has been around 
for two years, Ive never picked it up. 
When I saw a square-jawed Superman 
resembling Dick Tracy, how could I re
sist the new look of the Batman cover, 
even though it was sporting a $2.50 
price tag. But, it was a slow week, so 
why not.
The creative team (Kelly Puckett, 
writer; Mike Parobeck, penciller; and 
Rick Burchett, inker) are all new to me, 
and I already admire them a lot after 
just one issue.
Pucketts fast paced, witty writing 
takes me back to the good old days of 
when I began reading comics. I cant 
remember the last time I read an angstfree Batman that was pure fun from
beginning to end. It was great to see a happy, 
healthy Bruce Wayne cracking jokes.
The art team of Parobeck and Burchett is a 
very worthy choice to represent the popular 
art style of the animated series.
Parobeck provides some of the cleanest pen
cils, accented nicely by Burchett inks. The 
constantly changing panel layouts on the pages 
and the unique angles in the panels them
selves make each page a new pleasure for the 
eyes.
For some reason Ive always been a sucker 
for comic books divided into chapters or acts
like this book. Im not sure whether to at
tribute this compliment to Parobeck or the 
editor Scott Peterson, but anyway I loved 
the title for Act Two, Sinners at the Hands 
of an Angry Zeus (an historical reference to 
the Great Awakening speech by Jonathan 
Edwards, Sinners at the Hands of an Angry 
God). The title of the whole book, Super 
Friends, also made me all nostalgic for 
those Saturday mornings of youth.
Before I get all teary eyed, I highly recom
mend rwo OeDled Cg9odDycoa to any and all 
comic book fans. Books like this are the 
reason I began to read comics in the 
first place and the reason why I con
tinue to read them.
Oops, I almost forgot to mention that, 
in addition to the great story, issue #25 
also features a really great pin-up sec
tion by industry greats like Matt 
Wagner (-codgop, uedgled k3aDoc3 
rwoeDco), Kelly Jones 0uedgled, all of 
the Knightfall, Knightquest, etc. cov
ers), and one of my favorites Mike 
Mignola (,opp6U3, TceMype).
A short public service announcement: 
In celebration of their 10th Anniver
sary, Phantom of the Attic on South 
Craig Street is having Chris Moeller 
(Dark Horses Shadow Empires) and P. 
Craig Russell (Sandman #50, the Elric 
mini-series) for in-store signings.
Moeller will be there on Monday, Sep
tember 26 from 1 to 3 pm and Russell is 
appearing on Wednesday, September
