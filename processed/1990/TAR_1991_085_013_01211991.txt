War is not healthy for children 
and other living things, says a 
common peace poster older than 
most CMU students. This particu
lar replica was frayed on the sides 
and taped togetherand also older 
than most CMU students.
Its owner, an anonymous grand
mother at last Tuesdays peace rally 
in Oakland, verified the age. 25 
years old, she said. Ive been pro
testing for 25 years. I started... for 
my son, and now Im doing it for my 
grandson. Theres got to be a better 
way than killing people.
That was a shared ideal among 
the 1500 protestors at the rally 
which some tout as one of the big
gest in Pittsburgh ever. The rally 
was organized by several organi
zations, one of which was the newlyfounded CMU Students For Peace. 
Local students and citizens gath
ered at the Fort Pitt Lawn, stopped 
briefly at the CMU Naval Reserve 
Building on Forbes Avenue, then 
marched on Morewood Avenue and
turned onto Fifth Avenue. They 
stopped at the Software Engineerr. 
ing Institute and then continued to 
The Cathedral of Learning. At SEI, 
the marchers were quieted for 
speeches from Vince Eirene, a local 
activist; Father Jack OMalley, a 
Catholic Priest; ad Shirvonne 
Metcalf from the Committee In. 
Solidarity with the People of El 
Salvador. Later in the day, fifteen 
students were arrested and given, 
citations for civil disobedience.
Marcher Ken Boas, an area school 
teacher, compared the rally to ones 
that he participated in during theVietnam era. This is larger than 
anything I saw during Vietnam, he 
said. Boas purpose for marching 
went beyond the immediate threat 
of war.
Im marching today, he said, for 
peace, because Im against Bushs 
aggressive military policy ... Im 
marching for jobs for Americans, for 
negotiations. I want to be part of a 
movement ... its a movement for 
everyone, not just the wealthy who 
want to protect their power. There

the United States will not see the

from service are available; however,

Spokesperson Larry Waltman. The 
penalty for not registering can reach

those who fail to report to their ex

The Selective Service currently 
enjoys a 97 percent compliance rate 
for registration, which, according to 
Waltman, translates to 14.4 million 
registered men. While thats a hefty 
number of people to keep track of, 
evaders of the draft are carefully 
sought by way of monitoring drivers 
license and voter registration, as well 
as immigration and naturalization 
rosters.
So, what if there is a draft? Under 
emergency mobilization procedures, 
all registrants are considered to be 
classified 1-A, available for service, 
unless they are given a different

to class cancellations
By RHONDA STRUMINGER
Tartan Staffwriter
Six elementary and intermedi
ate-level Modern Language 
classes originally scheduled for 
the spring semester have been 
cancelled due to unforeseen 
budgetary constraints, according 
to Modern Languages Chair Bar
bara Freed.
At the time of pre-registration 
in the fall, we [the Humanities & 
Social Science Deans office and 
the Modern Languages Program]
did not fully understand the im
plication of the unforeseen bud
getary constraint on the program, 
said Freed. Once made aware of 
this in early December, we had to 
take some drastic measures to 
permit us to meet a wide range of 
major educational responsibili
ties.
The cancelled classes are 
French I; Advanced French II, 
Section B; Elementary German I; 
Intermediate German I; Elemen
tary Spanish II, section A, and 
Intermediate Spanish I. Ninetytwo students in all were affectedby 
the class cuts.
The Russian II class was one 
almost included on the list of 
cancelled courses. However, the 
five students in that class ap
pealed to administration officials 
and were able to get the class 
reinstated.
We (the students of the class) 
felt strongly about Russian be
cause this is the first time it was 
ever offered in the University,

University Center to be 
completed in fall 1993
By DAVID LADEK
Tartan Assistant News Editor
The new University Center should be completed 
about the beginning of September of 1993, ac
cording to Carnegie Mellon Senior Vice President 
Ed Schatz.
We hope to have it open and available for 
students' use at the beginning of the 1993-94 
school year, said Schatz.
Right now, construction is scheduled to begin 
with the razing of Skibo Hall, which is to start 
around November 1 of this year, he said.
Unfortunately, according to Schatz, the build*-
ing is projected to cost between $40-42 million. 
[CMU President Robert] Mehrabian has said we 
wont borrow any money to build it  so we have 
to have a good chunk of that money on hand.
So far, only the schematic layout part of the 
building design has been finished. Those draw
ings are on display in Skibo 100.
Planning is currently in the design and devel
opment stage, said Schatz. The architects are 
now worried about the functionality of the rooms, 
the finishing materials, and other details like 
that. They also talked with students about the 
uses for the building to help plan designs accord
ingly.

Dining Service announces changes for spring
j3y MATT ADLER
Tartan Staffwriter
As a result of customer feed
back, this spring students will be 
seeing many changes in Dining 
Service. According to Dining 
Service Assistant Director Roger 
Heydt, results from customer 
counts, comments, customer sat
isfaction surveys, and meal plan 
participation rates, amongothers, 
indicated the need for various 
changes.
In response to a real demand 
for late night service, says Heydt, 
the Tartan Grill has extended its 
hours. It will remain open until 
midnight seven days a week, and 
the meal contract allowance will 
be $4.25.
Additionally, the Tartan Grill
will open its doors at 8:30 am on 
weekend mornings while brunch 
service at Morewood Gardens will 
be discontinued.
Turnout at Morewood Gardens 
for the brunch has not been sig
nificant, said Heydt. The eco
nomics of the situation did not 
warrant both places being open. 
Morewood Gardens will also be 
closed for dinner on Friday nights 
but Salads Plus hours will be ex
tended through 7 pm.
Many of these changes are due, 
in part, to the new Kiltie Court. 
The food court and common 
seating area are showing a very 
favorable response. Business at 
the Tartan Grill and Salads Plus 
is up by 300 customer counts.
Salads Plus, in particular, has 
shown a large increase in busi
ness. The hot entrees in Salads 
[Plus] have exceeded our expec
tations five-foldits incredible, 
Heydt remarked.
We are trying to satisfy more 
people. They said they liked Sal
ads [Plus] so we made it more 
available, said Heydt.
The success Dining Services is 
having with the Kiltie Court is so 
extensive that it is impacting the 
design of the new University 
Center. Planners are trying to 
incorporate a similar setup in the 
new student center.
At Highlander, some smaller 
changes have been made. In an 
effort to reduce lines, the Deli Bar 
has been relocated to a position in 
the dining room. On a more 
regular basis there is a duplicate 
hot entree serving line and the
soup and salad line is moved to a 
less crowded section of the serv
ing area. According to Heydt, the 
result of the change has been a 
greatly improved customer flow 
over the past week.
Five new menu boards have 
been placed around the entrances 
of Highlander. Now people are 
better able to determine whether 
or not they would like to eat at 
Highlander before they use a meal 
and see what is being served.
As for decor, changes in High
lander are still being considered. 
Plants were added and soon stu
dent artwork may be placed on 
display.
Further Dining Service changes 
will involve an arrangement with 
Dominos Pizza. MorePizza deliv
ery has been strongly criticized,
so now students will be able to 
order pizza from Dominos using 
Validine. We are also looking into 
if and how we could incorporate 
Dominos delivery into the stu
dent meal plan for Fall semes
ter, says Heydt. The basic ar
rangement will be implemented 
in the next several weeks.
Other projects include looldng 
at ways to renovate the Morewood 
Gardens serving line. Once Skibo 
has been demolished, the effi
ciency of Morewood Gardens will 
be very important. This summer, 
when Skibo will be torn down to 
make room for the new Univer
sity Center, Highlander may stay 
open later in the evening and 
offer an a la carte menu to com
pensate for the Tartan Grill being 
gone.
One of the concerns Dining Ser
vice has in maintaining food ser
vice later at night is with the 
employees having a difficult time 
getting home. Thus, there are 
positions available for students, 
particularly those interested'TiS 
working evenings. For more in
formation about a part-time po
sition, contact Rochelle Koeft 
x6888.
A Dining Service represent 
tive will address SDC at the nxt 
meeting, this Wednesday, r 
garding meal plan rates and con
tract cash allowances.
There are possible rate and al
lowance changes being considered 
as well as the possibility of a rie\y 
meal plan to be determined. ^- 
tails will be discussed at the 
meeting.
Gulf crisis support group offers a place to talk
By LAURIE WILKISON
Tartan Staffwriter
In reaction to the crisis in the 
Gulf, the Counseling and Student 
Development Center has ar
ranged a Mid-East Crisis Sup
port Group to meet twice this 
week. Any member of the CMU 
community is welcome to talk, 
listen, and share common con
cerns, said center director Lorrie 
Rabin.
According to Rabin, students 
were coming to the CounLeling 
Center to discuss anxieties even 
before the war began. I immedi
ately decided that groups would 
be a good way of dealing with 
some of these feelings ... the hard 
part is to be alone with your fears, 
said Rabin.
The discussion will be staffed 
by senior staff member Sandra 
Kryder and three part-time coun
selors. After the initial discus
sions, the Center will continue to 
hold meetings if students express 
an interest, and will offer indi
vidual counseling as well.
Associate Dean of CFA
Meredith Myers has also arranged 
a support meeting. Myers 25- 
year old son, is in the Air Force 
and was part of Wednesday nights 
first strike against Iraq. For me, 
it helps to talk about it, said 
Myers, and I would really like to 
be available to others who want to 
talk. Its a real frightening thing. 
As for the anti-war protests that 
have taken place at CMU and 
around Pittsburgh, Myers ex
pressed conflicting feelings. I 
have a lot of anger, but my son is 
defending the freedom for people 
to be able to do that, said Myers. 
She said her anger is largely di
rected at the situation itself. I 
am angry that one man has such 
power and such insanity at the 
same time and just that people 
cant live peacefully.
Senior H&SS student Maggie 
OToole has three friends in the 
Persian Gulf and said she doesnt 
think a war protest is necessarily 
a lack of support for the people 
who are fighting. You can sup
port the people who are fighting 
without supporting the reasons 
and the way they are fighting,

"You can support the people who are 
fighting without supporting the rea
sons and the way they are fighting. 
 Maggie OToole 
senior English major
said OToole. She also said A 
rally for peace is what the people 
over there would want.... The 
people on the front lines would 
want peace more than we can 
ever imagine.
Junior IM student Mark 
Winterhalter has a best friend on 
the front lines for the marine in
fantry. Winterhalter said he has 
nothing against protesting the 
war because thats what a de
mocracy is all about. He said 
that while he feels Saddam 
Hussein has got to be stopped, he 
himself is not in agreement with 
how the U.S. is going about it. 
But blocking traffic annd dem
onstrating is not going to solve
anything, said Winterhalter. If 
all the peace activists want to do 
something they should write let
ters to their Congressmen because 
they put them in office and theyre 
the only ones who can really do 
anything about this. 
Winterhalter said he went 
through the really upset part 
when his friend was first sent, 
but now he is trying to deal with 
it constructively. I have two 
choices, he said. I can either 
worry or I can not let it affect my 
everyday life. It cant.
OToole said she worried a lot 
more when she was home, but the 
responsibilities of school help to 
take, her mind off her concerns.
There are so many other priori
ties, which I dont like, but it does 
put a lot in perspective and it 
makes some other worries seem 
trivial.
For some, family ties make the 
war in the Gulf that much more 
real. Sophomore H&SS student 
Jen Sorenson has nine relatives 
living in a suburb of Tel Aviv. 
Luckily, the day before the war 
started they called to say that 
they, like the rest of the country, 
were prepared.
Its sad that Israel was made 
to get involved, said Sorenson. 
Im scared for my relatives, but I 
think the war in this case is nec
essary.
Because last week was the first 
week of classes, many professors 
felt they didnt have a chance to 
discuss the topic of the war, which 
was on many peoples minds. 
While there were teachers who 
were able to devote class time to 
this topic, other professors were 
wary of such discussion. Physics 
professor Hugh Young said, One 
has to be very careful discussing 
controversial things in the class
room, unless its explicitly im> 
derstood that thats what the 
course is about. He said ajpt 
discussion would have to :3?e 
carefully controlled so as to 
maintain a respect for all view
points.
While Jim Hoberg, Associate 
Head and professor of ECE, said 
that he hadnt introduced the topic 
during class, he pointed out the 
benefits of doing so. I would like 
to see science and engineers much 
more involved in how their tech
nology affects society as a whole, 
he said.
Despite much concern over pre
senting such a topic in the class
room, many professors expressed 
a willingness to talk with students 
individually concerning their 
feelings about the war.
Meanwhile, the support group 
through the Counseling Center 
will be held on January 22 at 7:30 
pm in the Mudge Lounge and on 
January 23 at 11 am in the 
WherrettRoom. Meredith Myers 
will talk with any interested 
students in Skibo 201 at noon on 
January 23.

If either of these makes your pulse race,
talk to us.Having to get a real job 
isnt so bad.
Not when theres a place where the 
people get as pumped up about technol
ogy as you do.
A place where you work on real stuff 
right away. And red tape and bureaucracy 
are kept away.
Of course, there is a catch. We only want 
software and hardware professionals who like 
to be on the leading edge of high technology.
Thats because our business is help
ing other high tech companies develop
and produce tomorrows 
products.
Were Involved in electronic design 
automation, automatic test equipment,

are market leaders.
Our work environment is, well, colle

we offer an educational assistance plan

So talk to us. Or settle for a job that

Service 
dodgers 
will face 
5 years, 
$250 G
DRAFT, from page 1
relieve the obligation to serve. A 
person who is opposed to any form 
of military service is required to 
perform a period of civilian service 
equal to the length of time in
ductees serve in the military, and 
in a job which contributes to the 
national health, safety, or inter
est, as determined by the Direc
tor of Selective Service.
Those who oppose only the 
combat aspect of military service 
would be assigned to noncomba
tant duties while being exempt 
from training in the use of weap
ons.
Special consideration is also 
given to surviving sons or broth
ers in a family where the parent 
or sibling has died as a result of 
U.S. military service or is cur
rently a prisioner-of-war or 
missing-in-action. They are ex
empt from service, but only in 
peacetime  when the U.S. is not 
involved in a declared war  like 
now. Peacetime exemptions are 
given to veterans as well.
Special consideration is given 
to members of reserve components 
as well (including the National 
Guard and advanced level ROTC 
cadets who have already signed a 
reserve contract) who are eligible 
for a separate classification and 
perform their military service in 
the! National Guard or the re
serves.
Only two groups of people are 
recognized by the Service as to
tally exempt from the draft. These 
are nation or state-wide elected 
officials  including judges of a 
court of record  and ministers, 
including rabbis and their coun
terparts in other recognized reli
gions.
However, Waltman points out 
that one must keep in mind that 
although the draft is essentially a 
lottery system, the lottery pool is 
determined accordingto age. The 
first priority group in the event of 
a draft would be men in the cal
endar year of their 20th birthday, 
says Waltman.
Assuming the draft is activated 
this year, those men born in 1971 
would make up the first lottery 
pool. From there the pool would 
advance by yearly increments: 
those born in 1970, then 1969, 
and so on.
Further exemptions include 
hardship deferments, which are 
given to men whose induction 
would result in financial or other 
difficulties to persons who depend 
on them for support, such as a 
family.
Aliens and dual nationals may 
also be exempt from service in 
some cases, depending on their 
place of residence and country of 
citizenship.
Finally, those who are deemed 
mentally, physically or morally 
unacceptable for service are re
stricted from induction. This 
category includes persons with 
any of literally hundreds of medi
cal problems, as well as those who 
are exempt for reasons such as 
sexual orientation.
Finally, if you dont qualify for 
any of these categories and youre 
intent on avoiding the draft, well, 
there is always Canada. But you 
better leave before there is an 
indictment brought against you, 
as here is an extradition treaty 
between Canada and the United 
States. Dont plan on ever coming 
back, though  as Waltman 
points out, the statute of limita
tions never runs out on an 
unserved indictment.

are too many [minorities] on 
the front lines.
But Boas, who was an active 
protestor against the Vietnam 
war, also feels the need to pass 
on the torch of activism.
This is a fantastic showing, 
he said, and I think its really a 
testament to the students de
sire and determination to stop 
this war before it starts. How
ever, Boas senses his con
straints now. A lot of the energy 
has to be from the students. Im 
a teacher now, and the best I 
can do is educate my students. 
As the march turned onto 
Fifth Avenue, protestors 
chanted, Honk if you want 
peace. As the march passed 
her car, one woman was crying.
As the rally left SEI, Joe 
Heckel was with them. Dressed 
in an army green suit, Heckel 
was wearing a uniform cap with 
the words Veterans for Peace
 a national organization of 
veterans who are against war
 printed on it.
Were against war. Some of 
us realize that the answer is not 
in killing people, he said. And 
thats what it really is: young 
people killing young people. 
Heckel is a reluctant veteran 
from the popular war, World

War II. I didnt want to be there, 
he said, but I was caught up in 
the draft right out of high school 
when I was eighteen years old. 
Heckel went back to Europe after 
that war.
I was visiting Germany in 1949, 
and I met some young people, my 
age, and I realized that if I met 
them a few years earlier, wed 
have been killing each other, he 
said. Later in the trip he went to 
France. He was walking in the 
woods with a friend when he real
ized that they were in a cemetery. 
All of a sudden, I looked down 
and I saw it was [my friends] 
brothers grave. He was the exact
same age as me, killed in the war. 
All you can do is cry, and thats 
not enough.
But what is enough? The gen
erations before us are trying to 
pass on the torch, but who is 
standing in front to accept it?
CMU Students Against War is 
one organization willing to carry 
on. Peter Shell, a research pro
grammer, was an instrumental 
figure in the formation of the 
group right before the end of win
ter break, mostly in response to 
the Persian Gulf Crisis. We had 
25 people come to our first meet
ing, and that was before classes 
started, said Shell. Weve been
tabling and helping with 
[Tuesdays] march, he said.
Shell has been working behind 
the scenes for the group. Ive 
been acting as a liaison between 
the other student organizations 
and the community organiza
tions, he said. This unity was the 
driving force behind Tuesdays 
rally and the consequent rally on 
Wednesday after U.S. planes 
bombed Baghdad.
The groups have worked to form 
The Committee For Comprehen
sive Peace. Said Shell, The 
Committee for Comprehensive 
Peace is made up of peace and 
justice groups throughout Pitts
burgh... Its not just students; its 
families of troops, teachers, 
activists...its a city-wide coalition 
[for peace].
Tara Noone, a member of CMU 
Students For Peace, said the nowuniting Students For Peace orga
nizations in the area planned 
Wednesdays rally at the Federal 
Building in Pittsburgh tenta
tively. We decided that if war 
was declared, at 4 pm the next 
day  whatever day that was  
we would have a rally, she said.
CMU Students for Peace along 
with Pitt Students for Peace are 
now focused on minimalizing the 
conflict. We cant stop the next 
bombing raid, but maybe we can
pressure Bush not to escalate 
it, said Shell.
One point that the student 
protestors stress is their feeling 
toward the soldiers. Said Noone 
We are not against the troops 
and weve already called both 
commanding officers of the 
ROTC to tell them to tell all the 
ROTC students that. We dont 
want the ROTC students to feel 
alienated by what were doing, 
we just dont want them to go 
and die, she said.
In response to their older 
counterparts, the students are 
grateful for the guidance, 
something which the Vietnam 
protestors did not have. Theyre 
all being pretty active them
selves, said Noone. I think the 
activists left over from the six
ties knew the power that the 
 students had, and theyve just 
encouraged us not to underesti
mate our power as students.
Shell also acknowledged the 
contributions the older protest
ors can make. Students need 
their help and energy. Older 
activists can contribute, and 
should contribute their re
sources, their skills and guid
ance, he said.
You know, he said,  Teach 
your children well, theres 
something to be said for that.

Mips. Au revoir. Auf Wiedersehen...Budget woes require Modern Language cuts
7GU4LG4AIc gm.s S/,i f
:{]ioner. We had already comnleted the first half of the class 
and some of us were looking for
ward to actually studying in 
Russia one day. Students who 
ieeded the class would have had 
to the University of Pitts
burgh, since Russian is offered 
there. Commuting is difficult be
cause Pitt classes begin on the
hour and CMU classes begin on 
the half hour.
Another reason we appealed 
was because President Mehrabian 
has pledged to support interna
tional studies, he said. To pro
vide such a program requires 
teaching diverse language 
courses; it is hard to study abroad 
if you cant speak the language of 
where you are going to study. We
are very grateful that our class 
was offered again.
We did not take such a deci
sion lightly. The decision was 
made with great deliberation and 
in close collaboration with 
Stephen Fienberg, Dean of 
H&SS, said Freed. It is impor
tant to stress that the department 
as a whole and I personally were 
very distressed about cancelling
courses and we recognized it as 
an inconvenience to students who 
pre-registered.
I found out that my class was 
cancelled when I returned to 
school and found a message on 
my machine notifying me, said 
sophomore physics major Morgan 
Williams. I took the self-paced 
beginning Spanish II last semes
ter and I was hoping to continue
taking Spanish, but now I have to 
wait until next fall. I tried to take 
the Intermediate Spanish II 
course but the professor said that 
it would not be a good idea. So Im 
stuck.
Freed assured students that 
opportunities in the Modern 
Languages department will be 
available in the future. We are 
very anxious to provide the op
portunity for each and every in
terested student on campus to be 
able to study a foreign language . - 
in as enriching and educational 
environment as possible, she - 
said.
I am very optimistic that next 3- 
year we will be able to provide 
new and innovative courses. We 
are looking to hire many people of "  
international repute.
Senate, A Phi 0 take second shot at elections
A7AtdvwUIc gm.s S/,i f
members according to chair Mike Reed, 
ivill be presented to Senate as a group for 
approval. Reed says that the election 
ioard consists primarily of A Phi O active 
members minus any candidates and 
anyone working for a candidate.
Available for this election are all the 
seats which were open for the last elec
tion including: three seats in CIT, two 
seats m CFA, one spring seat in SCS, two 
seats in H&SS, three seats in MCS, one
fall seat and one spring seat in GSIA, two 
fall seats and one spring seat in SUPA 
and one seat in IM. Several of these seats 
remained uncontested after the last 
election.
Reed expects that the election board 
will ... validate the petitions, basically 
making sure that 25 activities fee-paying 
students from the particular college [of 
the candidate] have signed the petition. 
The Election Board will notify the candi
dates as soon as the petitions are vali
dated.
The elections themselves will be held 
outside Doherty Hall on Tuesday and 
Wednesday January 29 and 30. The 
Election Board will count the votes fol
lowing the close of polls.
The turnout for the poorly publicized 
fall election was 4.6 percent of the stu
dent body. According to Neighbor, The 
percentages were off, but it was par for 
the amount of time the [voting] tables 
were open. The best turnout CMU has
ever had for an election was 26 percent of 
the student body which voted on the 
referendum to return 37 percent of the 
activities fee to the Greeks. In compari
son to many other universities that is 
pathetic, said Reed, who is hoping for a 
much higher turnout for the upcoming 
elections which have had more publicity 
and will have longer polling hours.
The late elections will put a little bite 
on Senate according to Reed. Mostly it 
[the late election] hurts Senate because
its a shorter semester; they cant get 
near as much done.
Neighbor stated that the first meeting 
of Senate will be Wednesday. At the 
meeting Neighbor plans to break up the 
remaining Senate members into two 
committees: a funding and recognition 
committee and a public relations com
mittee. Neighbor wants to create the 
funding and recognition committee be
cause we have to begin to set the budgets 
calendar.

FORUM
Students can help the war effort
After five months of national 
and world debate over whether or 
not to go to war in the Persian 
Gulf, the question changed sud
denly Wednesday night to what 
should be done now that war has 
come.
This question is perhaps most 
important for our generation. It is 
people our age who are fighting, 
and in some cases dying, in the 
war with Iraq. Our generation will 
also soon bear the responsibility 
of leading whatever world comes 
out of the war.
Although the Carnegie Mellon 
community has been as divided as 
the rest of the nation over how to 
handle the Gulf crisis, we think 
there are a few ideas almost all of 
us can agree upon.
The first is that if this war is to 
be fought, it should be fought to 
win with minimum cost. Presi
dent Bush seems to have this goal 
in mind and we urge him to con
tinue to emphasize it.
We should also agree to support 
and aid our troops however we 
can. Among the things those of us 
at home can do are the following: 
Write to servicemen and ser
vicewomen in the Gulf. Ifyou know 
somebody who is serving in the 
Gulf, send that person a letter. If 
not, send a letter anyway and ad
dress it to any serviceman or 
servicewoman. Either way, you 
will make the day of someone who 
is half a world from home and 
alternating between boredom and 
terror. Address letters to landbased service members to:
Any Service Member 
Operation Desert Storm 
APO New York 09848-0006.
For sea-based service members, 
change the last line to:
FPO New York 09866-0006.
 Give blood. Even in peacetime 
there are often shortages of blood 
and war will only make the situa
tion worse. Although blood banks 
across the country have been get
ting large numbers of donors, the 
military will need a steady supply 
of fresh blood throughout the war.
Blood banks are asking that people 
call to schedule appointments to 
give blood when it will do the most 
good. And if the war ends before 
your appointment date comes up, 
give anyway. Both military and 
civilian patients will need blood 
even after the fighting ends. Call 
456-1900 to make an appointment 
at the Central Blood Bank.
Recognize that the war will be 
expensive to the country in finan
cial terms as well as human ones. 
Someone will have to pay for this 
war and given the federal 
governments existing budgetary 
problems, it should be done now, 
rather than later.
Since the oil companies have 
made a collective fortune off the 
Gulf crisis and stand to be aided 
by the protection of Saudi Arabia 
and the liberation of Kuwait, a 
steep tax on those profits could be 
a good place to start. However, 
even with those revenues and 
whatever money Bush manages 
to squeeze out of Saudi Arabia 
and other countries, there will still 
be a large bill to pay.
Our taxes, may have to be in
creased and we should all accept 
that instead of trying to push the 
burden onto other people by bick
ering over which taxes are hiked 
or passing the bill to future gen
erations by making the govern
ment borrow the money.
Compared to the costs being paid 
by the military personnel in the 
Gulf and the civilians of some 
Middle Eastern countries, a few 
dollars a week out of our pay
checks would be trivial.
In short, we should do whatever 
we can to aid our troops. We may 
be divided over whether they 
should be fighting, but we should 
be united in realizing that their 
intent is to protect our interests 
and that we owe them support.

Au revoir to modern languages
When President Mehrabian 
came to CMU, he cited improving 
undergraduate education and ex
panding educational opportunities 
abroad as two major items on his 
agenda. These plans should in
clude a significant improvement 
in the Modern Languages De
partment, and increased opportu
nities for students wishing to 
study foreign languages.
Unfortunately, Mehrabians 
ambitions in undergraduate edu
cation and opportunities abroad 
suffered a major blow early this 
semester when the Modern Lan
guages Department abruptly 
cancelled six language classes, in
conveniencing 92 students who 
registered for the classes last fall.
Even more unfortunate, several 
of the students did not even dis
cover the change until they showed 
up for class, only to find a notice 
posted on the door that the class 
was cancelled for the semester.
Department Chair Barbara 
Freed has expressed great dismay 
over the decision. We appreciate 
the departments regret, but nev
ertheless, we cannot understand 
why this problem could not have 
been avoided.
First of all, the unforeseen bud
getary constraints which caused 
the cancellations can only be a

Saddam Hussein has 
continuously com
pared his invasion of L6ttf tO 
Kuwait to Israels oc
cupied territories.
He was willing to pull out of Kuwait 
only if Israel left the West Bank and 
Gaza Strip. Saddam Hussein did this 
only to unite the Arab countries and 
reduce the initial hostility from neigh
boring countries. Animosity toward the 
state of Israel is the only motivator 
Hussein could use to aggregate the Arab 
nations. He has also successfully con
vinced many other people that the two 
situations are similar.
Israel never initiated an attack against 
its neighbors. In 1948 Palestine was di
vided by the United Nations. Israel re0 1* K K A 1 I 0 XDESERTSTORM
ceivedland and the Palestinians received 
land. Jordan did not waste any time 
taking the land from the Palestinians.
In 1967s Six Day War, Israel was 
attacked by Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, and 
Syria. In that war, Israel had no choice 
but to defend itself.
In retaliation for the attack, Israel 
captured the West Bank, Gaza Strip, 
the Sinai Peninsula, and the Golan
Heights. Israel has always intended t( 
return the land if they made peacfe. Is 
rael stood by its promise when I 
was ready to end its war against Israel 
The Sinai Peninsula, which is about 
twice the size of Israel, was turned ovei 
to Egypt.
In contrast, Iraq has no intentibh oj 
leaving Kuwait. An article published bj 
the Anti-Defamation League observes 
Ironically, if there is any real connection 
to be drawn between Iraqs devastation 
of Kuwait and Israel, it is that what Iraq 
has inflicted on Kuwait is precisely what 
the Arab world has been seeking to dote 
Israel for the past 43 years.

CM
result of bad planning. The de
partment should have better pre
dicted interferences with the bud
get before it went ahead and 
scheduled these courses. Ambi
tious planning by departments is 
highly encouraged, but not if their 
goals are so lofty that they cant 
keep their promises.
Second, if the department could 
not find any way out of cancelling 
these six courses, more sufficient 
notification of the students should 
have been implemented. Hearing 
a message on your machine a day 
before classes start or finding a 
sign on a classroom door are not 
convenient. If the problem was 
discovered early in December as 
Freed indicated, letters could have 
been sent over the break to the 
affected students, allowing them 
time to select an alternative course 
and register when they returned.
Although these ideas are too late 
for the Modern Languages De
partment, we hope that other de
partments will heed our advice if 
they ever face similar problems.
And we are hopeful that the in
novations planned for the future 
of Modern Languages and the ful
fillment of Mehrabians goals can 
be realized without causing the 
headaches experienced this time 
around.
Editor:
I hope 
and pray 
that by the Letter tO
 Z the Editor
letter, it will no'longer be nec
essary. This letter is to pro
test the irresponsible lack of 
maintenance of a display for 
Nati ve American people in the 
first floor hallway of Resnik 
outside the Highlander Caf
eteria. The display was won
derful for the first week or so, 
and I applaud its content and 
apparent intentions. I support 
whatever group put up the 
display, and I thank you for 
your efforts. Now, whoever you 
are, you need to finish the job 
by maintaining your display 
so that it does not become an 
affront to the entire campus.
Any public statement, how
ever it is made, must be made 
responsibly. It should make 
its point clearly, and should
take opposing points of view 
into account. And, as any 
speaker can tell you, if the 
statement becomes too pro
longed and uneventful, the 
audience will lose interest and, 
in bad cases, hecklers may 
start calling out from the au
dience. If a statement is not 
made well, its message will be 
lost because the audience will 
associate it with the faulty 
presentation. Conversation 
about the Native American 
display was positive at first; 
people seemed to be learning 
from the posted information. 
Conversation today is rather 
negative, but not about the 
Native Americans; rather it is 
negative concerning the dis
play: Did you see how some
one wrote in big black marker 
all over other peoples mes
sages? Where are the note pads 
so I can write something? The 
display has broken one of the 
guidelines above, and the
message has been lost from 
the audiences conversation.
How has this happened? The 
display was left out too long, 
like a prolonged, boring 
speech. The post-it pads and 
pens that were provided for 
comments disappeared after 
about ten days or so (it. has 
been so long that I dont re
member correctly). The heck
lers were given room to take 
over, and it has been shown 
that CMU campus has plenty 
of that to go around. These 
hecklers were resourceful 
enough to get a black marker 
and write over other messages, 
or bring their pens along and 
write something directly on 
the brown paper backing of 
the display. A few responsible 
messages (perhaps even posi
tive ones) remain, but the rest 
has been defaced to the point 
of embarrassment.
How can anyone, in good 
conscience, provide a display
like, this to represent any 
cause? The display was beaui 
tiful for a while, but has sin 
become an embarrassment t< 
see. You who make statement 
about race, gender, and the 
like are representing yoiii 
cause to the outside world by 
the method you use to makt 
your statements. This display 
well-placed but badly car 
for, has become a symbol o 
Native Americans to anyone 
who sees it, and the impressioi 
is a bad one. This is a worth 
while and important cause 
and the immature notes 
written on the display are bad 
enough; must we also witness 
a group that has forgotten its 
statement and left the display 
to rot in the halls of Resnilj 
Please, take the display down. 
Contact me if you need help ir 
doing so.

Sex Week: We dont have it enough
on
Letter to 
the Editor
Editor:
I couldnt help notic
ing the publicity over 
the Sex Week on the 
Carnegie Mellon Uni
versity campus. I am 
writing to present some possible topics for 
discussion for the next years event. Some 
of these topics may have been discussed 
during the last Sex Week; I dont know, as 
I wasnt involved.
Currently, most discussion concerning 
sex center around safe sex, a term usu
ally used to define methods to avoid dis
eases and unwanted pregnancy. Few 
people include issues concerning sexual
ity which are also an important part of 
safe sex  by sexuality, I mean the intan
gibles of a sex life that can also affect ones 
well being.
In my opinion, teaching people only about 
contraception and disease avoidance and 
calling this safe sex is akin to teaching one 
how to wear a seat belt and calling it safe 
driving or teaching one how to wear a life 
preserver and calling it flood control.
Some topics concerning sexuality that 
could be discussed during sex week are 
listed below. The issues addressed below 
have been developed from listening to 
peoples concerns and also from life in 
general.
SEX

How do I learn to understand what my 
emotional needs are? How do I convey my 
emotional needs to others?
Which emotional needs are sexual?
What if I feel a desire, to express my 
emotional need in a sexual way to inap
propriate people?
What distinguishes emotional from 
sexual from physical needs? How are they 
the same?
What does it mean if every time I try to
satisfy my emotional needs, I feel guilty?
Is it possible to control my emotions. 
How? At what times?
What are the short term emotional re
percussions of an active sex life with mul
tiple partners? What are the long terni 
repercussions?
What are the short and long term emo
tional repercussions of monogamy? Relf 
tive to the same repercussions associate 
with multiple partners?
What are the short and long term emo
tional repercussions of celibacy? Relativ^ 
to the two choices above?
Which sexual lifestyles foster the most 
emotional stability? Which seem to foster 
the least stability?
How do I go about repairing emotional 
damage? How long should I expect certain 
pains to last? Can talking to others help 
with my emotional pain?
How do I know if people are playing witlj 
my emotions? When am I being exploitedHow do I know if I am playing with 
anothers emotions?

Can Saddam be his own worst enemy?
The Archers Quiver
fa**. -------
Allan Bourdius
The United States and its allies in the 
anti-Iraq coalition have one great thing on 
their side: Saddam Hussein. Its clear that 
while Saddam may be a rational man, he is 
completely out of touch and has a total lack 
of understanding of the outside world, es
pecially the United States.
Take, for example, one of his propa
ganda broadcasts directed at U.S. forces in 
the Middle East. Baghdad Betty has told 
our forces shockingfacts like, While youre 
away, movie stars are taking your women. 
Robert Redford is dating your girlfriend. 
Tom Selleck is kissing your lady. And
then comes the ultimate concern, Bart 
Simpson is making love to your wife. 
What this shows us is that Saddam has no 
knowledge of American culture or think
ing.
Saddam Hussein made a critical miscal
culation when he invaded Kuwait. He re
ally didnt believe that the Soviet Union 
would leave him in the cold.
Five years ago, the Soviet Union would 
have supported Saddam just to spite the 
U.S. Today, that would be unthinkable for 
the Sovietsthey need economic support 
from the west.
I think its clear from Saddams actions 
and words leading up to the initiation of 
hostilities that he had absolutely no idea 
about the destructive power lined up 
against him or that he actually believed 
we would attack.
After Congress approved the use of force, 
Saddam replied, The vote was not an
absolute majority. He obviously didnt 
understand that that didnt matter. Actu
ally, he couldnt understand that  hes 
never had a political challenge. Any time 
somebody disagreed with him, he had them 
killed.
An Iraqi citizen was quoted as saying 
that Iran attacked us with planes and we 
were protected. We will be safe. At most, 
the Iranians sent 20 planes at once at Iraq. 
We sent 100 times more.
The Iraqi air defense forces were so un
prepared to meet a massed air attack that 
we struck with near impunity. To this 
time, only five of nearly 2,000 U.S. fighters 
and bombers have been shot down.
Wednesday, Saddam met our attack with 
defiance, saying that the Satan in the 
White House had no stomach for casual
ties. Our President has declared that we 
will not stop until the U.N. resolutions are 
implemented. Our Congress has either
passed or is bringing forward new legisla
tion reaffirming the Presidents actions 
and Congress support for our young men 
and women in uniform. A USA Today 
telephone poll taken the night of the at
tack said that 75 percent of the American 
people support the current course of ac
tion. On the whole, we are a nation united 
behind our President. In George Bushs 
words, We will not fail.
Unfortunately, we were unable to head 
off an Iraqi attack on Israel, but our losses 
over the first 48 hours total less than onehalf of one percent of the forces sent against 
him.
Clearly, this is a war he cannot win with 
all that is arrayed against him. He cannot 
comprehend this, and this is the weapon 
that will defeat him.
Allan Bourdius is a sophomore applied 
history major.
Stop the celebration: No more slogans
Don Pickett
It has become a year of slogans: 
'it all boils down to oil, No blood 
for oil, No more Vietnams. 
People are yelling loudly to make 
their views felt, to make their 
presence known.
There are too many slogans. 
The latter-day flower children are 
ecstatic, overjoyed at having their 
own war. No longer do they have 
to look back upon the sixties with 
envy, or wish for 1967 all over
again. Now they can rally, shout, 
scream, and make their mark. No 
more Vietnams.
The armchair generals are 
beaming. They can now speak of 
the Great U.S. War Machine, re
joice in its power, its precision, its 
glory. They can relish the thought 
of thousands of laser-guided bombs 
hitting thousands of Iraqi targets, 
killing thousands of Iraqi soldiers. 
A latter-day Blitzkrieg.
I have had conversations with 
war nuts on campus. They spoke to 
me straight out of USA Today, re
gurgitating statistics and kill ra
tios, and, God forbid, body counts. 
They spoke but did not understand 
any of the ideas I interjected, all 
my talk of politics, and govemmental self-interest, and settling 
grudges. This one isnt gonna be 
like the last one. No more Vietnams.
It is a year for watching the 
American love of oversimplifica
tion, of taking a complex issue 
and stripping it down to one 
phrase, one jingle: It all boils 
down to oil, No blood for oil, 
No more Vietnams.
It angers me, all this simplifica
tion. This war is not some new 
Vietnam, some practice field for 
U.S. weaponry. The War in Iraq 
is not a war for oil, not a war for 
freedom, not a war for democracy. 
The War in Iraq is an almost 
perfect example of war as a geo
political problem-solving tool. It 
is a war for the most cynical and
simple of reasons, a war because 
it solves problems.
George Herbert Walker Bush 
and Co. made the choice for war for 
the only reason a country will ever 
fight: national self-interest. Bush 
and Co. are sending a message to 
any other dictators in the world: 
The U.S. still thinks it has the 
right to intervene, and will do so. 
They chose to fight because they 
wish to preserve the world as it is, 
where the U.S. can intervene 
wherever it wants to, and act as an 
international policeman or bully, 
whatever the situation demands.
The U.S. is using the war to 
squelch a problem before it starts. 
Bush and Co. would rather fight 
Iraq now then face a nuclear Iraq
in five years. They would rather 
nip a possible Hammurabi in the 
bud than face more Arabs with 
more dangerous weapons. There is 
no glory, no fight for freedom. It is 
self-interest and politics.
There is another reason, more 
basic, more human: Bush does 
not like Hussein, this desert dic
tator who dares tamper with his 
new world. The Arabs feel this 
too. In Tel Aviv, Ridyah, and 
Damascus, politicians were say
ing, Just wait until Saddam 
crosses that line, until he makes 
the wrong move.... They were 
waiting for an excuse to stop 
Hussein before he could make the 
Arab question one worth fighting

The Granny Awards: Honoring the worlds finest con artists
This Is Not an Incinerator
Kevin Barney
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to 
the first annual Granny awards, honor
ing the best and worst in todays music. 
This is Kevin Beirdrenkur broadcasting 
for WBAM, 99.5 FM, live from Wash
ington, D.C., where D.C. actually stands 
for dope capital.
Our first winners of the evening have 
just received the award for best lipsynch. They just gave their acceptance 
speech, and now theyre coming back
stage to talk with me. Silly Vanilli, to 
what do you attribute your vast success 
in lip-synching?
Silence.
Ladies and gentlemen, Silly Vanilli 
has brought out a tape recorder and a 
huge box of tapes. They are now rum
maging through it, presumably looking 
for the tape with the correct answer.
Yes, thats it!! Larry Silly Vanilli is 
nodding his head. Wait a second. Com
munication is going to go beyond the 
heard word. Its time for charades!!
Bear with me, ladies and gentlemen. 
Okay, two words. First word: Larry is 
pointing to his head with his finger. That 
must be empty, no, hard, no, wooden, 
yes!! Wooden. Second word: Hes point
ing to Mo Silly Vanilli, whos still rum
maging around in their collection of tapes. 
That must be dummy. Yes, its dummy. 
Wooden dummy.
Mo Silly has found a tape and hes 
putting it into the tape recorder. Lets 
listen to their answer now.
We would have to attribute our success 
in lip-synching to the fact that as chil
dren growing up in suburban West Ger
many, we got jobs playing the wooden 
dummies for local ventriloquists. We were 
very successful at what we did, which is 
why we can't talk at all now. Doing so 
much lip-synching at such a young and 
tender age, our vocal chords were dam
aged. We couldnt make an original sound 
to save our lives.
Well, thank you for that response. I 
understand that youre going to go ahead 
with a new album on a different record 
label. Could you explain what this new 
album will be about?
Mo Silly is removing the first tape 
from his recorder and replacing it with a 
new one immediately. Do you guys get 
asked about your new album a lot? 
Theyre both nodding their heads yes. 
Yes, we are proud of our new album. It
should be out sometime during this next 
month. It will consist of covers of old 
popular favorites, like Led Zeppelin's 
ecWhole Lotta Love, The Who's Wont 
Get Fooled Again, and of course, AC I 
DCs Back in Black.However, we will 
be adding a new dimension to these old 
favorites. We will be miming them. We 
will have no one on this album to give us 
voices. Every sound on this album has 
been created by us. Would you like to hear 
a sample ?
Id love to hear a sample. Ladies and 
gentlemen, were about to hear the first 
song from Silly Vanillis new album, a 
cover of Led Zeppelins Whole Lotta 
Love. Here it is.
Silence for about five minutes. 
Excuse me, Silly Vanilli. Has it ended? 
Okay, one more minute.
Another minute of silence.
Now, its over. Mo Silly is getting out
another tape for his recorder. Hes put it 
in.
Musically it wasnt much, but Jieither 
was our first album. Wait til you see the 
video.
Okay. One last question for you guyS: 
What is the name of your new album? 
Silly has grabbed another tape. I guess 
that you guys must hear that question a 
lot.
Our new album is called The Dumb 
Tongue.
Nice play on the word dumb. Wei] 
thank you, Silly Vanilli. We look forward 
to your new album. And this is Kevin 
Beirdrenkur for WBAM 99.5 FM signing 
off from Washington, D.C.

The crisis in the Gulf opens a can of worms
George F. Will
Saddam Hussein is no Hitler, 
but Tariq Aziz is a Goebbels.
Saddam Hussein, having no ra
cial or other world view, only am
bition, wants to live to fight another 
day, not die in a concrete bunker. 
But Aziz, by his big lie (Kuwait? 
What Kuwait? Iraq cares only for 
Palestinians), conceivably fore
shadowed an outcome of this crisis 
short of war:
Iraq might withdraw from Ku
wait with a patina of dignity pro
vided by intimations of the obvious 
willingness of the world commu
nity to sacrifice Americas only 
real ally in the region,the state of 
Israel. The Bush administration 
may be in no positionor mood 
to offer much resistance to that.
A dark harvest of headlines  
soaring budget deficit, bank fail
ures, Bonapartism in Moscow  
color a mood in Washington more 
anxious than any time since 
Watergate in 1974. The President 
waited five months to seek con
gressional authorization  which 
he still insists is constitutionally 
superfluous  for the use of force. 
Then he requested such authori
zation in a week when the failure 
in Geneva was but one element in 
an atmosphere of unraveling.
The federal deficit, supposedly 
banished from polite conversation 
for five years by Octobers budget 
deal, is burgeoning. The new defi
cit projection is alarming but opti
mistic. It is that this years deficit 
will be $50 billion higher (substan
tially more than Octobers deal 
purported to cut from the deficit) 
than projected the last time the 
projection was revised upward. 
Allowing for proper accounting of
the Social Security surplus ($66 
billion) and other trust funds, the 
deficit will reach $400 billion. The 
assumption behind the additional 
$50 billion projection includes re
covery by the third quarter, and 
net positive growth for the year.
Furthermore, there is a chance 
of serious convulsions in the finan
cial system. More Northeastern 
banks are in jeopardy, and some 
regional banks are vulnerable be
cause of declining real estate mar
kets in California and Florida.
The continuing overhang of as
sets from the S&L liquidations, 
which are behind schedule, make 
$425 billion deficits likely this year 
and next. Now, suppose there is a 
war, and it lasts not weeks but 
months, costing $2 billion a day 
while (in the words of Sen. Boren of 
Oklahoma) our competitors, Ger
many and Japan, whose interests 
we are protecting, sit on the side
lines smiling.
The November 8 decision sealed 
the shift away from the policy of 
punitive deterrence (sanctions plus 
protection of Saudi Arabia). The 
deployment then reached a critical 
mass and became the policy: Poised 
in an inhospitable desert, the forces 
must be used soon or readiness 
will decline from a precarious peak.
Furthermore, while President 
Bush was establishing a danger
ous precedent, arguing that XJ.S. 
foreign policy goals acquire special 
(he almost seemed to say indis
pensable) legitimacy from U.N. 
approval, U.S. goals went way be
yond those of the United 
Nations.They now encompass 
radical reduction of Iraqs arsenal 
and even, by implication, destruc
tion of Saddams regime.
Since November 8, it has been 
probable that Israel will be made 
to pay for war or the avoidance of it.
If war comes, the thin veneer of
President Bush established a danger
ous precedent, arguing that U.S. for
eign policy goals acquire special (he 
almost seemed to say indispens
able) legitimacy from U.N. approval.
the coalition will not disguise the 
fact that it is the United States 
waging war against an Arab na
tion, with radicalizing and desta
bilizing effects throughout the Arab 
world.
The price for readmission of the 
United States into the good graces, 
such as they are, of Arab nations 
will be an international conference. 
The purpose of the conference will 
be to coerce Israel into perhaps 
terminal vulnerability.
If war is avoided, it will be be
cause Arab nations have endorsed 
the fiction that Iraqs aggression 
was altruism on behalf of Palestin
ians. The crisis will then turn on 
the hinge of the Arab constant  
hostility to Israel, Americas only 
constant ally in the region.
Last Sunday on television, Sec
retary Baker denied that the 
United States had recently voted 
for a U.N. resolution that charac
terized the West Bank and Jerusa
lem  Israels capital  as Pal
estinian lands. Said Baker: No, 
we didnt vote that it constituted 
Palestinian lands.... Not Palestin
ian lands.
In fact, the resolution pronounces 
the United Nations gravely con
cerned about the deterioration of 
the situation in all the Palestinian 
territories occupied by Israel since 
1967, including Jerusalem.It was 
the second time in two years that 
the United States had voted for 
such language, which is an histori
cal and legal he.
Come war, come peace, that lie 
may be the foundation of future 
policy  an odd foundation on 
which to erect that moral enter
prise, the New World Order. But 
the crisis that began with the 
United States unfurling a banner 
proclaiming No Munich! may 
end with a Munich, an interna
tional conference to carve up an 
inconvenient democracy.

Dont label persons

Letter to 
the Editor
Arou.mV
The road to 
hurtful jour
nalism is 
paved with 
good inten
tions. You wrote a good, honest 
account of a woman with HIV, 
and then you blew it with a very 
prominent headline using the la
bel victim [Victims sense of 
life resurrected after AIDS vi
rus,! 2/3]. Shes no ones victim, 
except to the extent youve vic
timized her with that headline. 
To make your point absolutely 
clear, the headline for the next 
article on the page says ARC 
victim enlightens students on ill
ness. The word victim then gets 
repeated several times on page 
L5.
A person battling HIV is 
nobodys victim. Victims are the

Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome
helpless andpowerlessrecipients 
of whatever evil wind blows their 
way. Rather, the wise HIVs are 
heroic crusaders against a dark 
and insidious force which must 
always be kept at bay. I recently 
saw a doctor term them the 
invulnerables. It is for this rea
son that the self-help groups for 
HIVs use the term PWAs, People 
with AIDS/ARC, not VOAs, not 
Victims of AIDS. PWAs arent 
victims unless they choose to be. 
Most are determined survivors.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  21 January 19919
Call it Kuwait, because its no Vietnam
Jonathan Levy
I went down to the Federal building last 
Thursday mostly out of curiosity. I knew I 
would disagree with almost everyone there, 
but I had never been to a war protest before, 
and the first day of the first American war 
since I was five years old seemed like the time 
to go.
I suspect many of the student protestors 
were there for similar reasons. People now of 
college age, especially liberals such as myself, 
seem to have a fascination with our counter
parts from the Vietnam war. That probably 
has something to do with the fact that we are 
the only Americans to have lived through 
part of the Vietnam war without remember
ing any of it.
There seems to have been an excitement in 
the late 60s and early 70s based on the idea 
that students could change history, rather 
than just reading about it. I think many of the 
students at the Federal building and else
where around the nation were trying to re
capture some of the excitement of the Viet
nam War protests.
But it wasnt there. And there is a reason 
for that. This is not another Vietnam, at least 
not yet, and most likely never. As the wife of
one U.S. serviceman said on television last 
week, the only thing this war has in common 
with Vietnam is the protests.
The most important difference between this 
war and Vietnam is the attitude of the country 
fighting it. This is no longer a nation whose 
view of war is shaped by World War II, the 
just war to end all just wars.
Three decades ago, the U.S. was willing to 
go to war quickly without good reason. Today, 
after having been horribly scarred by that 
mistake, the nation may even be too wary of 
war, if such a thing can be true.
Nobody wants to go to war, but most of the 
country realizes that we have to do so. The issue 
is not aggression, nuclear proliferation, or any 
of George Bushs other causes of the week. The 
real issue is the one he cant say out loud.
In 1991, the U.S. still needs the Middle 
Easts oil and cannot afford to let Saddam 
Hussein control it.
Our dependence on oil was demonstrated 
to me Thursday when I heard a protestor who 
would minutes later be chanting No blood 
for oil! comment that it was cold and she was 
glad she was wearing her polypropylene un
derwear. Polypropylene is a derivative of oil.
The nature of this war is very different as 
well. Our troops are not sloshing through 
swamps wondering where the enemy may be 
hiding. They are flying over deserts knowing 
that there is nowhere the enemy can hide.
Even when the ground offensive comes, if it 
comes, the fighting will not be the same as in
Vietnam. Ownership of the sides will be far 
more useful in the Middle East than in 
Southeast Asia, as Israel has shown repeat
edly by winning wars in the air while its 
forces were badly outnumbered on the ground.
U.S. forces will also have the support of the 
civilian population in Kuwait. Rather than 
being attacked by people who view the U.S. 
as an invading force, allied troops will be seen 
as liberators by the Kuwaiti people. They are 
far more likely to be greeted with flowers, as 
they were in France during World War II, 
than with the booby traps of Vietnam.
Finally, a critical difference between the 
current war and Vietnam is that we will win. 
We lost in Vietnam either because we couldnt 
win or did not have the national resolve to do 
what it would have taken to win.
This time we clearly have the technological 
superiority to win and a president who, for 
the first time in his political life, is firmly 
committed to something  the idea that we 
will win.
Nobody is saying that war is cheap or 
desirable. But the biggest loss of the Vietnam 
War would be if it had made us permanently 
afraid to protect our national interests.
Good luck to all the allied servicemen and 
servicewomen in the Persian Gulf. Come home 
safe and soon.

Dont use television to avoid thinking
Michael T. Rose
Welcome to the new world or
der. Weve got satellite links, cel
lular phones, and mobile missiles. 
Weve got round-the-clock inter
pretation, commentary, and the 
occasional moment of sheer terri
fying drama. Even if we dont have 
ai.y real conception of the days 
events, at least weve got cable.
This weeks historic events have 
been witnessed, if thats the word, 
by the citizens of the world. Glued 
to our televisions and our radios, 
we have a fluctuating and uncer
tain video and audio window on 
the machinations and responses 
of the various participants in this
violent show. We hear explosions 
and gunfire, we see talking heads 
or still pictures superimposed on 
maps, and we come together in 
front of the tube in small confused 
groups, looking for the truth.
I was perhaps fortunate to be in 
the group of Americans that was 
actually watching the ABC 
evening news on Wednesday night 
when the first reports came in of 
bombs in Baghdad. I saw all four 
news networks, in less than five 
minutes, kick their lines of re
portage into sudden action.
More than the shock of war, the 
unprecedented immediacy of the 
telephone reporting from Iraq left 
me stunned, as much in awe of 
the flurry of information and 
voices from around the world as 
of the air might employed by the 
U.S. and allied forces.
The past days have been some
thing of a blur, with most unoc
cupied waking moments spent in 
spastic monitoring of CNN. The 
Cable network has provided an 
incredible number of starts and 
dramatic moments, my personal 
favorite being the departure 
Thursday of Charles Jaco and his 
crew from their above-ground post 
in Saudi Arabia when they had 
warning of an imminent missile 
attack. Jaco kept reporting for a 
few moments, while anchors in 
Atlanta urged him to seek safety. 
Acknowledging their point, Jaco 
signed off; the final shot was of 
Jaco waving his crew out, with a 
brisk shout  Thats it! Break it 
down guys! Outta here!
Another interesting tele-experience came Sunday, when NBC 
correspondent Arthur Kent in
Saudi Arabia looked skyward at a 
live Patriot missile interception 
of an Iraqi Scud attack.
Although the media informa
tion is fascinating for us here far 
from the battles, it is important to 
remember that we cannot simply 
sit and watch the jets, hear the 
artillery, and know whats going 
on. If we dont think about this war 
 our warthen we arent doing 
our duty as informed citizens.
Talk to a friend, attend a rally, 
argue a point, predict the future  
be an active part of Operation 
Desert Storm, thousands of miles 
away. Dont assume that CNN will 
do your thinking for you, and dont 
depend on it to make up your mind 
for you.

fessional writing major.

WAR, from page 7
for again.
Hussein is a loose cannon on a 
fundamentalist deck. In a region 
as unstable and easily upset as 
the Middle East, there is no room 
for those who will not play by the 
lilies.
This is not another Vietnam, 
another rallying cause to raise 
the consciousness of the nation, 
to bring the people together to 
stop imperialism again. This is
not a brave, good war, wherel 
superior technology and higher ^ 
m or al gr ound wil 1 alio w the U. S: - 
to triumph mightily. This is not 
a war for oil, a war for freedom, 
a war for democracy.
Too many people are celebrat
ing this war. No more slogans. >

BLOOD DRIVE
Because our country is at war in the Persian Gulf, the Central Blood Bank has been asked to export 25 
units per day to a reigonal blood bank in Texas. Should the war escalate, the Central Blood Bank may 
be asked to provide as many as 500 units per day. These blood products will go to several places: 
other regions of the country who have relied on military donations for their blood supply, Veteran's 
hospitals (as wounded are returned to the states), and to the military hospitals in the Middle East.

Dont underestimate the importance of IM
A Faculty Perspective 
Robert Mehrabian
As part of my daily endeavor 
to learn more about the campus 
and its people, I participated 
this fall in some drills with the 
mens soccer team and later vis
ited with the womens soccer 
club.
As a former intercollegiate 
soccer player, I wanted to see if 
my now mature legs still had 
some kick in them. The mem
bers of the mens soccer squad 
can make their own judgements. 
The more I played, the more I 
felt the old intensity coming 
back. I was especially pleased 
to see that the other players 
shared that pleasure and that 
intensity.
I saw those same qualities 
.^gain later when I watched the 
womens soccer club work out in 
Gesling Stadium.
I discovered that intensity and 
commitment dont just describe 
Carnegie Mellon students ap
proach to their coursework. 
They bring those qualities to 
sports and other extracurricu
lar activities, too.
A relatively small percentage 
of undergraduates participates 
in the 17 intercollegiate sports 
represented at Carnegie Mel
lon. But this group has a remark
able record of achievement.
This fall, for example, the foot
ball team went undefeated and 
recorded its 16th consecutive 
winning season. The mens cross 
country team extended its NCAA 
Division III record to 109 con
secutive dual meet victories. The 
womens cross country team in
cluded two all-conference per
formers in the University Ath
letic Association (UAA) and the 
womens volleyball team produced 
another all-UM player. In addi
tion, the mens soccer team re
corded its 10th straight winning 
season.
Unlike NCM Division I sports 
programs (in which students re
ceive athletic scholarships), non
scholarship athletes at the NCM 
Division III level participate for 
the true pleasure of athletic com
petition. Like Division I athletes, 
though, theyre also playing hard 
to win.
And so are the many students 
who participate in club and intra
mural sports.
The University provides assis
tance to 12 sports clubs, who com
pete against players from other 
schools. While these club mem
bers dont compete under the 
auspices of the NCAA, youll find 
the same intensity in club sports 
such as baseball, rowing, rugby 
and mens and womens lacrosse 
as youll find in the intercollegiate 
program.
As a former soccer player, I wanted 
to see if my now mature legs still 
had some kick in them. The mem
bers of the mens soccer squad can 
make their own judgements.
Ive been most amazed and 
pleased, however, by the level of 
participation in our intramural 
programs.
The Intramural Department set 
another in a series of annual 
records by drawing more than
7,000 participants to 42 intramu
ral activities last year.
In the four areas of volleyball 
competition (including co-rec, 
three-person and faculty/gradu
ate student), for example, more 
than 1,900 setters and spikers 
participated.
Intramural mainstays such as 
basketball and touch football drew 
more than 1,000 and 750, respec
tively. Bowling, chess, pinochle, 
wrestling, table tennis, floor 
hockey  these and many other 
activities got students involved 
outside the classroom.
For all of those who participate, 
there are many more who should. 
One of my goals is to stimulate 
greater involvement by conferring 
varsity status on those programs 
that merit it and by providing 
increased support to clubs and
intramural activities.
I want every students Carn
egie Mellon education to include 
enriching, challenging and in
tense experiences in and out of 
the classroom. I know from per
sonal experience there are great 
benefits to derive from partici
pation in athletics.
Some of the most valuable 
lessons I learned as an under
graduate came through in
volvement in athletic competi
tion. I was vividly reminded of 
those lessons, the joys and in
tensity of athletics on a soccer 
practice field again this fall.

until long after their first com
mitments or relationships.

Comeback!
Women stage upset over Washington
Tartans score 
a grade 4A
As we begin a new semester, 
its time to take a look back at 
the first half of the basketball 
season and touch on the highs 
and lows. This week, Ill do the 
womens team, followed by the 
mens team next week.
The womens team and Head 
Coach Gerri Seidl have to 
receive an A for their efforts 
o far. A14-2 record, including 
a perfect home record dont 
leave much room for complaint.
A 7-0 start in the University 
Athletic Association, although 
only halfway there, is also a 
strong sign.
The causes of the two losses 
are pretty easy to trace, and 
seem to be single-game mis
takes rather than the begin-' 
nings of chronic problems. In 
the Franklin & Marshall loss, a 
52-33 F&M rebounding advan
tage and cold second-half 
shooting (29.6 percent) did the 
Tartans in. The Ohio Wesleyan 
defeat was brought about by 
excessive fouling. The 21 Tartan 
fauls were bad enough, but 
almost all of them were shoot
ing fouls and Ohio Wesleyan 
3 them count by hitting an 
amazing 26 of 33 from the 
charity stripe.
But how are the Tartans 
g this well? For one thing,
Id have to be either blind or 
Incompetent to ignore the 
contribution of freshman 
Jeanine Megahan. Finding a 
freshman whos good enough to 
start is a chore in itself, but 
getting a freshman who can 
ilead the team in scoring (14.3 
iper game, including four 20+ 
ifforts) is downright amazing. 
You certainly cant discount 
2 rest of the team. If Megahan 
doesnt bum the opposition in a 
[iven game, Amy Buxbaum will. 
'Or Heather ODonnell. Or... 
well, you get the idea.
Bench depth is another cause 
of the Tartans success. Last 
year, the Tartans only went 
pbout seven players deep in 
most games unless the game 
jvas a real blowout. Furthernore, injuries and mid-season 
oster drops cut into that 
number during the second half 
of the season. This season, Seidl 
can routinely go through nine 
players, even when the games 
are close, and the team has 
^remained free of injury until 
this weekend. The opportunity
0 rest players, along with the 
.ability to throw different looks 
at an opponent has made the 
team more effective.
Finally theres the intangible 
iffect of teamwork. It doesnt 
directly show up on the stat 
pheet, but the fact of the matter 
ls that this team is clicking 
pbout as well as possible at this 
Pint, and that means wins.
The biggest problem, other 
than the injury to Katie Fahey, 
that the Tartans may face in 
the second half of the 1990-91 
jampaign is that close games 
have been few and far between. 
n most games, the cruise 
control is usually on by the time 
he Tartans hit the closing 
minutes. Its going to be inter
esting to see if the Tartans can 
3 every close game as well as 
ey faced yesterdays Washington win.
However, when thats the 
Jligest concern I can think of,
1 s safe to say things are going Pretty well.

Tartan Business Manager
Its a pretty safe rule of thumb 
in basketball that when you spot 
the number three team in the 
nation a 15-point halftime lead 
on its own floor, you dont come 
back to win the game. Yesterday, 
however, thats just what the 
Carnegie Mellon womens bas
ketball team did by downing 
Washington University 6058.
Helped by a pick from junior 
forward Amy Buxbaum, junior 
guard Heather ODonnell pushed 
down the right side of the CMU 
offensive zone and buried a jump 
shot with only one second left to 
give the Tartans the win.
I fumbled the ball for a second, 
and I thought I was going to lose 
it. Then I just shot, and prayed it 
went in, said ODonnell.
The win, the Tartans fourth 
straight, raised their overall 
record to 142 and gave them sole 
possession of the University 
Athletic Association lead with a 
7-0 mark. The win also broke a 
Bears 19-game home win streak 
and 20-win UAA streak.
The beginning of the game 
wasnt quite as magnificent for 
the Tartans; excruciating was 
probably a better word. The Tar
tans shot a miserable 27 percent 
in the first half, and had a lot of 
trouble rebounding against the 
taller Bear players.
Offensively, we just suffered 
from cold shooting and had trouble 
rebounding, said Head Coach 
Gerri Seidl. On defense we 
werent sagging in the middle as 
much as Id have liked.
The game opened with a 15-3 
Washington run over the first 
seven minutes as the Tartan 
shooting was at its nadir. How
ever, the Tartans played even ball 
for the rest of the first half and 
went to the locker room trailing 
35-20.
I told them we didnt show our 
true selves in the first half, said 
Seidl. I knew that they believed 
in themselves and that we could 
come back.
All of us believed that we could

The next big club sport at Carnegie 
Mellon could be mens volleyball, if 
sophomore Paul Welding and nine of his 
friends get their way.
After playing together for the past two 
years in intramurals and pickup games 
on the Cut, Welding and his friends want 
to get involved in intercollegiate play 
and have found creating a club to be 
difficult.
We all have our minds on playing and 
not the administration, sophomore Dave 
Copeland said.
The members of CMU VBC, the new 
volleyball club, had to appear in front of 
Student Senate in last October and then 
hand in a financial package describing 
use of money for all basic equipment.
The club was able to present itself well 
enough to recognized and therefore 
funded by Student Senate.
The CMU VBC does not have a fixed 
schedule but is just going by ear, what
ever we can find, said Welding. Since
gym time is also hard to find the club 
practices at 6 am on Mondays and 
Wednesdays. There is no coach for the 
team, but a local high school coach has 
volunteered to assist them in practice.
CMU VBC also has a difficult time 
organizing because there are no team 
rules. People often play with the club 
only part of the time and will be consid
ered members for the week.
With the lack of a coach, a schedule, 
and a gym, disorganization gives the 
club a clear disadvantage at competitions.
In its last tournament, played on 
Sunday at Upper Saint Clair High School, 
the club only won one out of eight games 
and did not make the playoffs.
The likelihood of the new club becom
ing a varsity team is slim because of the 
NCAA rule which requires the same 
number of womens teams as mens.
The CMU VBC has already assisted in 
running a tournament at CMU last se
mester. The tourney included 14 teams 
and it supported Hungry Services Net
work by having a 20-cans of food entry 
fee for the teams.
come back and make a game of it, 
said ODonnell.
However, things got worse be
fore they got better. The Bear 
lead swelled to 18 with 17:33 to go 
in the game, and it looked as if the 
Tartans were in for a long second 
half.
Soon after, though, the balance 
of the game shifted back to the 
Tartans with a vengeance. The 
Tartan offense kept hammering 
away at Washington, and the de
fense played much more solidly. 
The result was that the Tartans 
began to slowly claw their way 
back into the contest.
They played a lot smarter in 
the second half, said Seidl. They 
relied less on dribbling and more
on passing on offense, and they; 
got a lot more help inside on'tfefense.

The Carnegie Mellon mens 
basketball team dropped to 4-8 
overall and 2-5 in the University 
Athletic Association with a 83 
63 loss on the road at Washington 
University in St. Louis. The 
Tartans were trailing by 20 points 
after the first 20 minutes of play, 
4727, but played an even second 
half with sophomore forward 
Lamman Rucker chipping in 12 
of his team-leading 14 points in 
the second half.
According to Head Coach Tony 
Wingen, I felt we were better 
prepared from a mental stand
point, but we got in a hole by 
settling for jump shots instead of 
getting inside. We also let them 
get a lot of offensive rebounds 
and points off of breaks.
Although the Tartans never 
held a lead in the contest, they 
held close to the Bears early on, 
trailing by two after the first six 
minutes. The Bears exploded with 
10 unanswered points over the 
next three minutes and slowly 
added to the score over the re
mainder of the half. Six points in 
the final minute provided the 20- 
point halftime margin.
Within the first five minutes of 
the second half, the Bears lead 
had swelled to 28 points, but the 
Tartans held tough and scrambled 
back to within 19 as the 10-minute 
mark passed. Unfortunately for 
the Tartans, a duplication of the

Upset and blowout color AFC, NFC championships
: throughout 17 weeks of regu

jwon the much sought-after playj'off spots.

surprise of many, the Giants stole 
that dream.
The Los Angeles Raiders, to my 
eyes and to the gamblers in Las 
Vegas, were the underdog team of 
JjDlayoffs that it is of champion- the final four. Their passing game,

)accomplished by none. To the Allen could save the Raiders, who
were victimized by a Buffalo team 
that was relentless in taking the 
victory.
Buffalo claims that throughout 
the entire season, it has been given 
little respect, especially against 
perennially powerful teams, par
ticularly against a team from the 
yesteryears in NFL football, Mi
ami. Buffalo proved this season 
that they deserve respect in the 
NFL ranks. But they don't de
mand it. Most of this comes from 
the calm attitude that pervades 
coach Marv Levy.
Levy has built a program in 
which the citizens of Buffalo can 
have pride. They are a proud team, 
centered around a proud coach 
who has given Buffalo a little bet
ter than Chuck Knox did in the 
early '80s. Hes also a better coach. 
At home, Buffalo could not lose to 
the Raiders, and slaughtered the 
AFC West champion 51-3.
TheNew York Giants are ateam 
whose fortune precedes it. After 
cutting Joe Morris, the Giants 
found that Otis Anderson can still
run, although hes beginning to 
run out of steam. Dave Megget is 
proclaimed the most underpaid 
player in the NFL. Maybe. Hes 
not the most overpaid, though 
that player was the Giants en
emy yesterday.
And they stumbled upon a 
quarterback on the bench who in 
my opinion has the potential to 
upstage Phil Simms. Jeff 
Hostetler showed he could engi
neer a win over San Francisco. I 
dont believe Simms would have 
done the same. Behind Simms, 
the Giants had a one-dimensional 
offense, or at least an offense with 
few, if any, surprises. Hostetler 
gives the quarterback position the 
mobility that Simms cant.
This season, the Niners have 
sputtered against teams with 
running quarterbacks, particu
larly Boomer Esiason from Cin
cinnati, and Warren Moon in 
Houston. I feel the Giants stood a 
better chance tactically behind 
Hostetler. But, I dont feel the 
team has quite the confidence in
the Hoss to help him win it. I was 
wrong. The Niners are not a 
team that one person can by himself beat, so the Giants used a 
totEtflseam effort to pull the up
set.
The San Francisco 49ers. What 
can you say? Their play wasn't 
particularly awe-inspiring this 
year, but they still won 14 out of 
16 games, losing only two, in 
which they had six turnovers each 
game. Even if you think your 
team is blessed, its extremely 
difficult to win a game in which 
the opponent takes the ball from 
you as many times as you have it. 
They do what must be done to 
win. Their first game exemplified 
this. Down by two points with 
less than two minutes to play, 
the Niners got the ball . They 
scored a field goal with four sec
onds left. And thus had their sea
son gone.
But yesterday, the tables were 
turned. And the Giants kicked a 
field goal with only four seconds 
remaining in the game, winning
15-13, giving the 49ers only their 
fifth loss in the last 37 games, all 
of these losses coming at home.
Yesterday, the NFL was given 
a bi-coastal shock. On the east: 
coast, the Buffalo Bills stunned 
everyone but their fans by com. 
pletely dominating a credible 
Raiders team. The Bills are 
making their first trip to the Su-: 
per Bowl on Sunday. In Sari' 
Francisco, the Giants surprised' ; 
everyone with their come-frombehind win and will be making 
their second trip to the Super Bowl1; 
in five years.
Earlier this season, the Giants; 
lost to the Bills. The Bills, after I 
three impressive games consecu-: 
tively, will probably be favored I 
over the Bills. I have to agree#' I 
Give the Bills a win, and the Su
per Bowl its second decent game! 
in three years, 23-20.
By the way, I think the firing of 
Buddy Ryan was foolish.

together a few short runs.
The Tartans proceeded to ice the game 
with an 11-0 run to begin the second 
half. Megahan, who led the Tartans with 
18 points, scored three straight baskets 
in the run, which built the lead to 40-26.

half. I think we showed that we can play 
with the better programs in the confer
ence.
The Tartans dropped a much closer 
game on Friday night, losing to the 
University of Chicago, 77-66. The game 
was a very physical contest as the teams 
combined for 48 fouls, including five 
foul-outs.
After we mature and gain more ex
perience, well win this sort of game, 
said Wingen. Well be more mentally 
prepared and make the plays we need to 
make.
Although neither team put together 
any major runs, the Maroons slowly 
pushed their lead to nine points at half 
time. The Maroons utilized their height 
advantage  of the four forwards used 
by Chicago, senior Eric Chilenskas was 
the smallest at 65  to control the 
inside game early. At the break, the 
Maroons led 41-32.
I was very surprised that they ex
tended their defense on us, said Wingen. 
They usually play a sagging, packed-in 
defense, but they came out and blocked 
passing lanes.
The Maroon lead went into double 
digits within the first minute of the 
second half, and stayed there until there 
were less than three minutes to play. A 
eight-point CMU run brought the score 
to within five, 71-66, with 1:33 left to 
play, but Chicago padded the margin at 
the foul line in the last minute of play.
During the run, we were using a de

ing how well it worked, I probably should 
have used it the whole game.
Derek Dragisich led the Tartans in, 
scoring and rebounding with 21 points 
and nine rebounds. No other Tartans jj 
reached double figures in scoring as the } 
Tartans shot 30.9 percent on the evening.  
Wingen remains optimistic despite the  
rec6nt setbacks: Were at the halfway 
point of our season, and I think were _ 
growing up, he said. Our freshmen 
arent freshmen anymore. Were goingtoj 
start seeing teams for the second time, 
and were going to have to use our ex-'

NHL players battle in All-Star 
game amidst talks of trades
THE PUCK
STOPS HERE
by Allan Bourdious
With the NHL season slightly more 
[ than half over, fans and players alike 
fathered in Chicago on Saturday after[ noon to see the NHLs best slug it out in 
[ the 42nd Annual All-Star Game.
Unfortunately for the fans, some of 
I the best players were going to be watch[ jng instead of playing. Chicago fans were 
particularly upset that Blackhawks

I the team.
Belfour currently leads NHL 
[ goaltenders in wins, New Jersey Devils 
I left wing Kirk Muller, the teams cap- I tain, was also left off the roster. Muller is 
I the highest scoring left-wing so far this 
I season with 13 goals and 36 assists for 49 
I points. Several teams have made or are
I attempting to make trades to get an 
I extra edge.
The Washington Capitals and the 
I Toronto Maple Leafs concluded a major 
1 deal. The Leafs sent promising young 
I defenseman A1 Iafrate to the Caps for 
I center Peter Zezel and defenseman Rob
Rouse. Iafrate had been struggling in 
Toronto because of personal problems 
and differences with the coaching staff. I 
think this trade benefits the Capitals.
The Quebec Nordiques sent veteran 
defenseman Joe Cirella to the New York 
Rangers for a fifth-round draft pick and 
a minor league defenseman. Quebec 
definitely got the better of this trade. 
Cirella is, at best, amediocre defenseman 
with skills that at times can be excellent 
but mostly hover in the realm of barely 
acceptable. Detroit Red Wings coach 
Bryan Murray reportedly was going to 
the All-Star game aiming to make a 
trade for a defenseman with offensive 
power.
The Rangers still sit at the top of the 
Patrick Division with the Philadelphia 
Flyers and the Pittsburgh Penguins giv
ing chase. Key injuries to left wing 
Brendan Shanahan and defensive player 
Bruce Driver have sent the Devils into a 
six-game losing streak and fourth place 
in the Division. The Capitals are just 
four points behind the Devils and the 
Islanders are at the bottom of the division.
Boston currently sits atop the Adams 
Division. The Montreal Canadiens are 
just three points behind. This one could

teams in the Norris Division just Dont 
seem worthy of the chase. St. Louis is a 
distant second with a record of 26-13-7 
and Detroit is an even more distant third 
with a record of 2221-5. Minnesota and 
Toronto round out the division.
The Smythe Division is the closest 
race left in the NHL with only two points 
separating the first place Los Angeles 
Kings and the Calgary Flames. The 
Edmonton Oilers have seemingly recov

are currently in third place. Vancouver

^ Many people wont be able to 
buy liquor from the State Store 
today because it, like other busi
nesses within the states jurisdic
tion, will be closed for Martin 
Luther King, Jr. Day.
However, for many people, MLK 
Day is more than just another 
day ff- Its a tribute to someone 
who pioneered the American civil 
rights movement and helped to 
bring about a better way of life for 
many people.
I Two CMU organizations, CMAP and the Division of Student 
^tfairs, sponsored a memorial 
service in honor of Dr. King last 
Tuesday, January 15, Kings ac
tual birthday. Approximately 150 
students, faculty, and staff at
tended the service held in the 
kkibo Ballroom.
CIT freshman Trinette Chaner> a CMU student in the NalQnal Society of Black Engineers
(NSBE), gave the keynote speech 
during the program which es
poused Dr. Kings own principles 
of non-violence.
Campus figures, such as 
Michael Murphy, dean of Student 
Affairs, and well-known figures 
from the Pittsburgh area, such as 
Loran E. Mann of WPXI news, 
spoke during the service. After
wards, those attending the service 
participated in a candlelight vigil 
held around the campus. Accord
ing to the sponsors, the program 
was a resounding success.
Although CMUs memorial ser
vice was held last week, there are 
several memorial services taking 
place throughout Pittsburgh to
day and later in the week.
Duquesne Universitys Black 
Student Union will be holding a 
memorial service at 11:00 am to
day. Other programs include the 
showing ofthe film Skokie .'Rights 
or Wrong, a movie about Consti
tutional controversy with the First 
Amendment, at the University of
Pittsburgh at 1:00 pm in the 
Forbes Quad. The National Con
ference of Christians and Jews 
will hold its annual service in the 
Trinity Cathedral, located be
tween Smithfield and Wood Av
enue, today at noon. Cynthia 
Baldwin, a judge in the common 
pleas court, will be the keynote 
speaker.
Betty Pickett, the executive di
rector of the National Conference 
in Pittsburgh, says that Martin 
Luther King Day brings back 
some vivid memories for her.
She remembers the events of 
the late 60s: The mood was born 
out of years of frustration and 
racial segregation. The student 
sit-ins were the beginning of a 
coming together of a people who 
for the first time began to see that 
things can change. People were 
willing to die for a better life.
Others have memories of Kings 
assassination in Memphis, Ten
nessee in 1968. Thomas Kerr, a

civil rights issues, says, I had to 
go from Pittsburgh to Washington 
to Lancaster and back to Pitts
burgh. Pittsburgh began to burn. 
When I got to Washington the 
same dayit was burning all the 
way up to Seventh Ave... I was
surprised to find that Lancaster 
had some stores up in flames, too. 
The big cities and the small towns 
had the same reaction [to Kings 
death]. I came home very startled 
by what I had seen.
Some may ask why people would
want to remember a time filled 
with turmoil and a man who has 
been gone for more than twenty 
years. Pickett says the holiday 
has a purpose.
Its a reminder that the dream 
has yet to be completely fulfilled.

PITTSBURGH...
Pittsburgh reacts to allied attacks on Baghdad
By DANIEL HOLLAND
Tartan Senior Staffwriter
Most Americans were glued to 
their television sets when news of 
,the U.S. attack interrupted all 
regular programming on all major 
networks. People across the 
, country reacted with shock and 
disbelief. Reactions in Pittsburgh 
: were no different.
! City Councilman Dan Cohen 
was in a Shadyside meeting with a 
community organization to discuss 
a proposal for a new hospital 
landing pad for Shadyside Hospi
tal when news of the war struck 
home. Cohen was nervous and 
fearful.
I hope and pray that the conflict 
Will be a short one, said Cohen. 
The war has completely taken 
over our lives. It is very scary.
Cohen also shared his views on 
Iraqs attack on Israel.
So far the Israeli government 
has shown remarkable restraint 
which will keep the scope of the 
conflict from getting any larger. I 
pray that it is not a long and 
drawn-out war, he said. Cohen 
hopes that the American and 
allied forces get the job done 
quickly with as few casualties as 
possible.
Those Pittsburghers who share 
Cohens views feel that they can 
make a difference in promoting 
peace and negotiation efforts in 
the Middle East.
Im appalled. We dont need to 
be at war, said Liane Norman of 
the Pittsburgh Peace Institute 
(PPI). Norman has spoken out 
against war numerous times in 
Pittsburgh and was disheartened 
when the U.S. Military carried out 
Bushs inevitable orders for 
Operation Desert Storm.
Bush showed courage with the
international community, 
Norman commented on the 
presidents ability to tie together a 
strong allied coalition. But she 
was not happy with his recent 
orders to bomb Baghdad.
Last Wednesday night, hun
dreds of Pitt and CMU students 
congregated downtown at the 
Federal Building protesting the 
hostilities which had broken out. 
The possibility of a draft brought 
fearful reaction from the crowd. 
Large-scale protests brought back 
memories of the Vietnam War.
The U.S. Army recruiting center 
in East Liberty said there will be 
no draft. PPI has organized 
workshops and educational pro
grams that will serve to comfort 
those who may be drafted though. 
However, for the most part, 
Pittsburghers are hoping and 
praying that the draft will not 
become a reality.Adibi carries message to Iraq
By D. HOLLAND
Tartan Sr. Staffwriter
Among the many 
protestors who are 
working to halt the 
fighting in the Persian 
Gulf is Jennifer Adibi, 
an Iranian-American 
and a Pittsburgh native.
She belongs to the 
international, interde
nominational Fellowship 
of Reconciliation, a group 
which has been referred 
to as the messengers of 
peace by the Iraqi news 
media.
C;The organization, 
whose major goal is non
violence, recently trav
eled to Jordan and Iraq 
to get a better perspec
tive on the Middle East. 
$dibi noted the hard
ships the Iraqi people 
faced due to economic 
sanctions.
The sanctions are 
working, said Adibi. She 
cited hospital shortages of 
antibiotics as one ex
ample. As a token of good 
will, Adibis group took 
much-needed medical 
supplies to Jordan and 
Iraq. As short in supply 
as medicine were rice, 
bread, and sugar, said 
Adibi.
The Fellowship at
tempted to initiate peace 
negotiations with Iraqi 
leaders. Said Adibi, We 
wanted to continue the 
dialogue [between Iraq 
and the allied coalition]. 
The group met with the 
Iraqi Speaker of the 
Parliament, but there was
little opportunity for 
frank discussion con
cerning peace.
Adibi explained that 
most people in Iraq do 
in fact support Saddam 
Hussein, but that the 
public is often misin
formed by Husseins 
government.
The Iraqi students 
were unaware of the 
Iraqi use of force in 
Kuwait,  she said.
However, possibilities 
for peace in the Persian 
Gulf are not as bleak as 
they seem. According to 
Adibi, We saw hope 
there. Those people 
didnt want to go to 
war. They had no choice 
but to fight. Adibi was 
surprised and very sad 
to hear that the U.S.
Jason Digman/Tartan Photo Editor 
tL buCriTub e/mmR / N/TTim oT bCSS.mu .g LYIY um..Sb oT vm/qY
had attacked Iraq on 
Wednesday. She added, I 
thought of all the people I 
met there and what they 
must be going through....
It makes me angry and 
disappointed.
Adibi was further 
disheartened to hear of 
Iraqs attack on Israel.
It scares me. It was 
clear that Saddam would 
attack.... I was not sur
prised, she said.
Adibi also believes that 
the U.S. is guilty of up
holding a double standard 
concerning Middle Eastern 
foreign policy. The U.S. 
rejected peace initiatives 
that dealt with the Pales
tinian issue. [The Iraqis] 
see the U.S. as being 
hypocritical.... Kuwait is 
not the only issue. Every
body in Jordan made the 
link between Kuwait and 
Palestine, Adibi said.
We have to deal with 
the Middle East as a 
region, said Adibi. The 
U.S. operates out of its 
own national self-interests 
... with little concern for 
other people and ideals. 
She concluded with a 
plea to the U.S. govern
ment to agree to negotiate 
and deal with the larger 
issues and consider the 
needs of other people if we 
really want peace.

CNN wars ABC in battle of inane coverage
, The sixteenth of January be<gan for me with an apocalyptic 
^announcement on the television. 
As usual, I got up at the crack of 
noon and flipped on the television 
'news. After the requisite Crisis 
in the Gulf news graphic, the 
CNN anchorperson thrust his face 
into the camera lens and declared 
'that night fell over Iraq today.
Such pronouncements are typi{\ of the brain-cloud which the 
threat of war has blown into the 
collective electronic consciousness 
!of this nation. From day one, the 
news industry, faced with a view
ing public which seems to be 
.convinced that the speed with 
Avhich a situation develops is directly correlated to the amount of 
(news programming it watches, 
Ijias assaulted the senses with a 
barrage of redundancy which has 
.exceeded all expectations in the 
magnitude and depth of its insig
nificance.
Up until the sixteenth, the net
works did their best to manufac
ture the hysteria of war without 
the violence. For the most part, 
their attempts to create a climate 
'of panic succeeded only in showthe news establishment as 
.'taking part in a drama only it 
|c.djiild see. The sole purpose of the 
."news establishment in the past 
{ix- months has been to particiin a mad rush to report every 
triviality in hopes of keeping 
{viewers on the edge of their seats 
with the possibility of something 
horrible.
On the morning of January 16, 
-even CNN was unable to ignore 
the fact that very little worth 
reporting had been going on in 
& enclaves of Operation Desert 
Shield, and that regardless of how 
'stirring the music is that is played 
over the authentic desert footage, 
it/is difficult to get too worked up 
'about the fact that the authentic
by Javier Grillo-Marxuach
desert footage consisted of three 
American service men tying 
sleeping bags to a parked truck.
Of course, this didnt deter the 
art directors of most news graphic 
departments from concocting the 
most creative representations of 
the Gulf Crisis to herald their 
networks presentations of the 
days non-events. Anybody who 
has been watching the news for 
the past four months is undoubt
edly familiar with some deriva
tive of the Nintendo-like-George 
Bush-Saddam Hussein-headshot-American-flag-super 
imposed-on-Iraqi-flag-iron-heelstomping-on-innocent-Kuwaitibaby-global-map-oil-tower-tanksunder-large-Raiders of the Lost 
Ark-lettering-which-reads THE 
CRISIS IN THE GULF logo. The 
graphic is usually accompanied 
by some asinine narration such 
as GEORGE BUSH HAS 
DRAWN A LINE ACROSS'THE 
DESERT SANDS (whipcrack, 
sound effect, the map bursts into 
flames), AND CNN-ABC-CBSQVC IS THERE!
It takes more than fancy com
puter graphics to keep war hys
teria alive, though, and those are 
only the tip of the newspersons 
sensationalist arsenal. The most 
insidious of the devices of misin
formation was used by nearly ev
ery newscaster in the field. It con
sists of waiting until the last ten 
seconds of the newscast are up 
and then asking the following 
question of the motley assortment 
of retired colonels, Pentagon hasbeens, cabinet never-weres, and 
assorted academes who invari
ably crawl out of the woodwork 
whenever an opinion is needed to 
fill up precious air-time in lieu of 
fact:
DO YOU THINK THAT 
THERE WILL BE A WAR?
Its not that this question may 
or may not be valid, but asking it 
with all of three seconds to justify 
a possible answer makes the 
question nothing more than a red 
herring. Yes or no, the question 
becomes somewhat akin to a 
cliffhanger ending. Yes? No? 
Join us again tomorrow for an
other edition of IRAQ - THE SE
RIES!
I was asleep when we attacked 
Iraq for the first time. I suppose 
that this is some sort of a meta
phor for my life. Naturally, I 
tuned in, and the networks, who 
seemed all too prepared to em
brace the prospect of war with 
their florid prose and graphics 
generators, managed to botch 
their entry into the war hyperbole 
sweepstakes. I am not merely 
speaking of the fact that, without 
warning, the graphics capacity of 
every one of the networks report
ing went to hell within the minute 
of the bombing of Baghdad. Not 
only did they resort to showing 
loose pages from their Rand 
McNally atlases into the camera, 
one network went so far as to use 
pieces from the board game Axis 
and Allies to represent Iraqi tar
gets.
Now dont get me wrong, its not 
as if I am complaining that the 
networks failed to deliver the 
wham-bam -thank-you-Van 
Demme quotient they promised 
throughout the months leading 
up to the conflict. Its just that 
five hours passed from the mo
ment in which my roommate woke 
me up and told me that squad
rons of coalition jets are flying air 
raid missions over strategic tar
gets in Iraq and the time in which 
I returned to bed and, although 
the news was on in every net
work, no one could come up with 
one more scrap of relevant infor
mation.
This is not to say that they didnt 
try. There were, of course, the few 
bozo-journalists who raised their 
hands at the Cheney/Powell press 
conference and asked the question 
What are we going to do next? 
as if the dignitaries would then 
proceed to display incredibly in
tricate pull-down maps detailing 
our military strategy (apparently 
some are still clinging to the dated 
conventional wisdom that 
Saddam will not have full cable 
TV capability for another ten 
years).
Other journalists sought more 
creative ways of filling up airtime, 
apparently bored of repeating the 
obvious. CNNs anchorman (the 
name is being withheld to protect 
the stupid) proceeded to ask the 
following question of Bernard 
Shaw, their man in Baghdad: 
WHAT IS YOUR HOTEL 
ROOM LIKE?
Had I been Mr. Shaw, my reac
tion would have gone something 
like this:
Well, apart from the fact that I 
am currently squatting under the 
love seat, jamming my nose into 
the plush pile carpet while the 
cameraman tries to escape 
through the plumbing it looks like 
every other fucking Hilton Ive 
ever been to!
Convinced that all of the fresh 
information had been spent (see
ing as one CNN newscaster actu
ally reported that Baghdad was 
being hit by REALLY BIG 
BOMBS), I flipped to MTV, a 
channel which was doing its best 
to uphold its image as a haven for
the righteously ignorant. MTV 
had spent the day playing anti
war videos. Foremost amongst 
these was the new version of 
Give Peace a Chance, sung by 
the likes of Lenny Kravitz, Yoko 
Ono, Sean Lennon and one or two 
really talented people who look 
positively embarrassed to be 
there.
Naturally, MTV was able to up
hold the post it has always held as 
the mirror of all that is inane in 
our culture. True to form, MTV 
was contributing to the bonfire of
stupidity by broadcasting a-ii 
MTV NEWS segment taped s;i-X 
months ago including artists 
opinions on the war. Perhaps tHe 
most telling statement in the cc5 
lage of misinformation and posturing-passing-for-politicalawareness came from Iggy Pop, 
who managed to contribute the 
following words of wisdom: 
Well, like, if this is going to b8 
the big one, then were all going to 
go down together, so, like, you 
know, you, like, know.

the United. Statesattack on

I heard it when I was in the

sad.
I was glad...they got it over

dont want it to be drawn out or

We finally did it. I mean, we 
sent all those people over there, 
but were they just going to sit 
around? Im opposed to the war, 
but while theyre there, they 
should be able to do their jobs.
I was just numb. I stared at 
the television to see exactly what

Imagine that someone offered you $13,000 and a year after 
you graduate to study something that has interested you for a 
long time, that excites you a lot, and that would require travel 
abroad in one or more cultures different from your own.
Would that interest you, and what would you do?
AWaftSdm. IF@Ml(iDWsMip can make this 
possible for you.
The College of Humanities and Social Sciences at Carnegie 
Mellon University is one of a select group of 55 schools who are

independent study and travel abroad following graduation. 
Approximately 75 Watson Fellows are selected every year, and 
receive grants ranging from $13,000 to $18,000 for travel and 
study abroad during the year following their college graduation. 
Eligible students include H&SS students, and non-H&SS students 
with an H&SS double major or minor. Preliminary applications 
are due in early October of the senior year. Nominees are 
selected in late October, and interviewed by the Foundation 
Director in the early Spring of the senior year.
Additional information: Come to a special informational meeting 
n Friday, January 25,1991 at 4:30 pm, in the Adamson Wing.

Nia Peeples (of Fame fame), is back 
in The Party Machine with Nia 
Peeples. Scantily clad women dance 
to popular hits as males presumably 
drool at home.
By A. FRANKLIN WHEELER
Tartan Staffwriter
Back in the golden years when 
we impatiently waited for Ricky 
Schroeders voice to deepen and 
for his deadpan Silver Spoons to 
be cancelled, we were condemned 
to one season of hellish enter
tainment. In most recent years, 
the networks have finally ad
justed to our short attention spans 
giving us three seasons of pre
miere shows.
While October is still the official 
start of the TV season, new shows 
are premiering all the time. There 
are at least three seasons now, 
with groups of new shows pre
miering in September, January, 
and April. 1991 is no different. 
ABC, CBS, and NBC are scram
bling to replace shows that have 
failed and are strengthening weak 
parts of their lineups. (Fox, with a 
lack of backup programming, has 
not yet made any midseason 
changes.)
Heres a night-by-night look at 
whats new and different on TV.
Weekdays: The $100,000 
Pyramid makes a return to day
time TV (Monday-Friday at 10 
am, channel 2, ABC). John 
Davidson hosts a new version of
the old standby, where contes
tants must guess words from clues 
given by their celebrity team
mates. Yes, its just a silly game 
show, but one that is eminently 
playable and fun to watch.
In late night, CBS is premiering 
a new series of crime shows 
(Weeknights at midnight, chan
nel 2) to counterprogram Arsenio 
and Johnny. Its too hot to sleep, 
boast the ads. Maybe, if you like 
gunfights and needless violence. 
Standard crime fare with a low 
budget, this mistake should be 
history in a few months.
And Nia Peeples (ofFame fame), 
is backin The Party Machine with 
Nia Peeples (Weeknights at mid
night, channel 22, WPTT), essen
tially an updated version of Solid 
Gold. Scantily clad women dance 
to,popular hits as males presum
ably drool at home. A disgusting 
premise, but it just might work 
following The Arsenio Hall Show.
Monday: NBC finally expelled 
Ferris Bueller and replaced him 
with Blossom (8:30 pm, channel
11, NBC). Mayim Bialik, who 
played a young Bette Midler in 
Beaches, stars as a teenager 
coming of age (the premiere dealt 
with her first period). Blossoms 
mother left four years ago to 
pursue a singing career in Europe,
leaving Blossom surrounded by 
men: her father and her two 
brothers.
This show has promise. The 
acting (with the exception of dad 
Ted Wooden Wass) is top-rate, 
particularly Eileen Brennan as 
the familys next-door neighbor. 
The writing, though, is 
uninspired, and the characters 
are disappointing (Blossoms ex
addict brother, for example, does 
nothing but goof off and make 
jokes about alcohol and drugs). 
There have been bright spots 
(such as Blossoms dream se
quences), but everyone involved 
just needs to try harder. If theres 
not improvement soon, Blossom 
will follow the route of her NBC 
teen counterparts, Ferris Bueller 
and Hull High.
Tuesday: ABC premieres 
Davis Rules after the Super Bowl. 
This school sitcom takes over 
Head of the Class old timeslot 
(8:30, channel 4), and stars 
Jonathan Winters and Randy 
Quaid. With a cast like this itll be 
hard for this series to go wrong.
Wednesday: Night Court 
moves back to its old timeslot (9 
pm, channel 11, NBC) to boost the 
ratings for NBC against Boogie 
Howser, M.D. In addition, 
Seinfeld, a hilarious vehicle for
Jerry Seinfeld in which sitcom 
and standup mix, returns at 9:30 
after a very successful summer 
run on Thursdays.
For some unknown and unex
plainable reason, ABC (channel 
4) has vet\xmediAnything but Love 
to the 9:30 slot as well. Unex
plainable because Richard Lewis 
and Jerry Seinfeld are very simi
lar  they appeal to the same 
audience, and they should not be 
on against each other. Stuck in 
the wrong slot, Love, a wonderful 
sitcom, will probably be gone by 
the end of the season, a victim of 
network programmers.
10 pm sees the return of Equal 
Justice (channel 4, ABC), a criti
cally acclaimed drama that had 
good numbers last season. It 
should develop a small buy loyal 
audience, but it wont come close 
to beating Hunter.
Thursday: Good Sports (9:30,
channel 2, CBS) has gotten a lot 
of press because of its stars 
(Farrah Fawcett and Ryan 
ONeal). Actually, the stars are 
the major drawbacks to what 
could become a pretty good en
semble comedy. ONeal is stiff and 
Fawcett is annoying, but the 
situations are funny. (In any case, 
its better than the exceedingly 
mediocre Wings on NBC).
Friday: CBS (channel 2) has 
revampedits Friday night lineup, 
moving Dallas back to 9 pm and 
inserting Guns of Paradise at 8 
pm. Lee Horsley stars in this re
named Western that promises 
more action and violence (and 
probably also promises the death 
of Quantum Leap, which has been 
wallowing near the bottom of the 
ratings all season long).
Sons and Daughters (10 pm, 
channel 2, CBS) is a confusing 
soap opera/family drama starring
Lucie Arnaz. It doesnt stand a 
chance (and might even help 
NBCs struggling Midnight 
Caller).
The big news on Friday is the 
return of Dark Shadows (9 pm, 
channel 11, NBC). In this re
vamped version a younger-looking 
and sexier Barnabas Collins is up 
to his old tricks. This soapy hor
ror will probably attract a cult 
following, but it is going to need 
supernatural help to overtake the 
aging but powerful Dallas.
Saturday: Nell Carters sitcom 
You Take the Kids has already 
failed after four weeks on the air 
and will be replaced by Uncle Buck 
(8 pm, channel 2, CBS). Look for 
the cartoon Family Dog to move 
into this slot soon; its a potential 
hit, and the competition (Amen 
and Young Riders) isnt too for
midable.
Lenny (8:30 pm, channel 2, CBS) 
isnt a bad show, but its too much 
like the show its up against, The 
Fanelli Boys (channel 11). Lennys

Mozarts Marriage of Figaro/) 
Beverly Sills and Luciano 
Pavarotti, eat your arias  opera 
is about to be performed Carnegie 
Mellon style!
After a year in the planning 
stages, Carnegie Mellons music 
department is ready to unveil its 
first opera project, Wolfgang 
Amadeus Mozarts delightful 
Marriage of Figaro on Januarj' 26 
and 28 at the Winchester 
Thurston School. There are three 
other performances scheduled as 
well  including a partial perfor
mance on a sleepingbag weekend. 
The musical comedy contains zany 
stories of infidelity, true love, ser
vants locked in closets, and mis
taken identities. The opera will 
be performed in English rather 
than in its original Italian form.
The libretto tells the story of 
Figaro, Count Almavivas stew
ard, who plans to wed the 
Countess young maid, Susanna. 
When Figaro discovers that the 
Count is interested in more than 
Susannas dusting techniques, he 
vows to humiliate him. With the 
help of the Countess, who wants 
to win her husband back, both he 
and Susanna try to shift the

dressed in drag.
Meanwhile, the old and single 
Marcellino plots to stop the wed
ding of Figaro because she is in 
love with him. With all the ironic 
twists in the story, one cannot 
help but laugh at the over-exag
gerated characteristics of Human 
nature.
Those involved in the opera 
project are upper class voice ma
jors (juniors, seniors, and gradu
ate students) and members of the 
Carnegie Mellon Philharmonic. 
The opera is directed and pro
duced by the Music Departments 
multi-talented choral director, 
Robert Page and renowned pro
fessional opera director Janet 
Bookspan.
In early October, the opera 
workshop classes prepared the 
voice majors for the project au
ditions. After two days of intense 
auditions, the show was double 
cast for the two performances. 
Each cast is made up of twentytwo people.
From November through win
ter break, members of the cast
disciplined themselves in prepar
ing to work with Bookspan, who 
has worked as a professional coach 
and as a director in several uni
versity productions. She arrived 
on the scene January 2 and the 
vocalists were ready for her.
First we had to go over our 
parts without the music in 
rhythm. Then after we did this we 
could add the music, said 
sophomore voice major Katy 
Shackleton, who is cast in the role 
ofBarbarina. Ms. Bookspan was 
excellent. She gave me a better 
understanding of performing and 
made me realize what kind of 
work it required.
The growth of the students 
vocally as artists and their 
newfound imagination and profi
ciency was mind-boggling, Page 
said of the casts preparation for 
the opera over winter break.
I think that the students are 
sensational. I can honestly say 
that professional people with 
whom I have worked do not take 
staging as quickly as this group 
does. They are quick, creative, 
considerate, and cooperative, 
Bookspan said. They were bril
liantly prepared. They came 
knowing what they had to do. I 
expected a lot out of them and I 
got more.
Bookspan has the unique gift 
of working with students. She 
recognizes that they are at a 
student level yet pulls them up to 
a professional level demeanor in 
approaching a role. Our common
goal is to bring these students up 
to the level of the opera, Page 
commented.
Since the beginning of the new 
semester, both the vocalists and 
the orchestra have been in intense 
rehearsals. The vocalists had 
three two-and-a-half hour re
hearsals each day before the start 
of classes. To prevent conflicts 
with classes, five hour rehearsals 
are now held in the evening. Both 
the vocalists and the orchestra 
are working hard in preparing for 
Marriage of Figaros debut.
The orchestra is wonderful. 
Weve had only five rehearsals 
with them and its worked won
derfully well. In an opera producWhat is most impressive about 
the project is the positive feedback 
from the student performers about 
their personal growth from 
working on the opera and the 
excitement they have felt from 
working with such people as Page 
and Bookspan.
Beinginthe project has taught 
me a lot. Bookspan treats us like 
professionals. She is not afraid to 
give us criticism as professionals. 
The experience has strengthened 
my endurance. I learned that 
without technique I could have no 
career, said junior voice major 
Lawrence Street, who plays
Figaro in the production.
The opera is a lot of work. I 
didnt know what to expect. I didnt 
have enough training to be at this 
level, said junior voice major 
Camille Kowash, who portrays 
Cherubino in the performance.
Its a great opportunity. This is 1 
the first opera I have ever played. ' 
Robert Page is great. Rehearsals 
run so smoothly. The opera re
quires a lot more work than in a j 
pit orchestra for a musical. There 
are fifty pages of music equivalent j 
to a Mozart symphony. I have a ! 
lot more respect for people who 
play in the orchestras for operas,

Gibson excels as the melancholy Dane
By STEPHEN GLICKER
Tartan Diversions Editor
Hey! Guess what?
What?
Franco Zeffirelli is going to make the 
film version of Hamlet!
Oh wow! Thats great!
Well, not really.
Oh? Why not?
Because Mel Gibson is going to play 
Hamlet.
Oh. Well, at least they got Zeffirelli to 
direct....
The proceeding short conversion was 
probably carried out by thousands upon 
thousands of people all across the United 
States when it was discovered who was 
directing and starring in Shakespeares 
Hamlet. People probably went on to 
discuss why Gibson was trying to take on 
such a tough role, what it would do to his 
career, and if he would even come even 
close to Sir Laurence Oliviers Oscarwinning performance.
Well, Shakespeare, Gibson, and movie 
fans alike can rest easy, because Gibson

returns with Mel Gibson as the title role and 
Franco Zeffirelli as the director. Also star
ring Glenn Close, Alan Bates, Paul Scofield, 
Ian Holm, and Helena Bonam-Carter.
gives a masterful performance as the 
troubled prince.
Unlike Zeffirellis Romeo and Juliet, 
which was splashed in bright, vibrant 
colors, Hamlets palate consists entirely 
of earth tones and is consistently dark 
and dreary. This approach works very 
well and fits into the medieval, down
beat nature of the film.
As stated before, Gibson does a great 
job as Hamlet, adding to the role a lot of 
the energy and humor found in Lethal 
Weapon. Glenn Close as Queen Gertrude 
just looks way too young to be Gibsons 
mother. She always appears to be on the 
screen, mostly doing nothing at all. On 
the other hand, Alan Bates looks the
part of Claudius, but his acting leaves 
something to be desired.
It is Helena Bonham-Carter as Ophelia 
who really shines through. Her portrayal 
of a bawdy, betrayed, and mad Ophelia is | 
totally convincing and at times truly 
frightening.
The dialogue is slow and drawn out at 
points. Zeffirelli probably did this so that 
the audience could better understand j 
what the characters are saying, but for ' 
people who know the play well it can be ! 
a distraction. The sword fights, on the 
other hand, are fast, furious, and energtic.
It is during these fights that Gibson j 
really shines in his acting ability as well ' 
as his swordplay.
One would wonder how anyone could 
go wrong with a story by Shakespeare. 
Well, it appears that Zeffirelli and 
Christopher De Vore decided to make a I 
few changes to make the play more j 
adaptable to the sliver screen. Those 
who have never seen or read Hamlet 
wont notice any gleaming errors or scenes 
out of place. However, those who know j

Pose for Playboy and get respect
Have you noticed how Playboy 
has become more respectable than 
National Geographic?
It used to be that every fathers 
nightmare was that his 19-yearold cheerleader daughter would 
come home one day and say, This 
wonderful man from Playboy 
wants to take pictures! Of me! 
And then Mom would start crying, 
and Dad would kick the little goodfor-nothing bimbo out of the house, 
and pretty soon shed be seen in 
the audience at a Prince concert 
with Rob Lowe.
But now its like winning Miss 
America.
You got eight nekkid pages in 
Playboy?! Oh my God, Im sooooo 
happy for you!
Cause were talking the big 
bucks here. Were talking movie 
deals. Were talking appearances 
for the next 15 years at the Santa 
Monica Car Show. Maybe were 
talking Vegas. Were talking 
swimsuit calendars out the wazoo.
Course, twenty years ago, none 
of this stuff mattered anyhow. 
But now, if youve got a career, 
youve got a life.
Last year I wrote an article for 
Playboy on the Queens of the 
Bs  actresses like Monique 
Gabrielle and Linnea Quigley who 
have become superstars in horror 
flicksand when the article came 
out, it was accompanied by pho
tos of about ten of em in flagrante 
torpedo, with the headline BJOE BOB GOES TO THE 
DRIVE IN
by Joe Bob Briggs
Movie Bimbos! I called up my 
editor and said, How can you do 
this to me? These women will kill 
me! You called em all bimbos! All 
of em!
And he said, Oh, dont worry 
about it. We told em the title of 
the article in advance. Their 
managers knew it. They knew it. 
They said it was fine.
Talk about publications with 
power.
Anyhow, I was thinking about 
this last month when Playboys 
new spread came out featuring 
Sherilyn Fenn, of Twin Peaks 
fame. I say Twin Peaks fame 
grudgingly, because Sherilyn was 
an emerging drive-in actress who 
has now started doing indoor 
bull stuff and will probly never 
return to the drive-in screen.
The first time I saw her was in 
a 1986 flick called The Wraith, 
that ghostcar revenge classic, 
where she wore enough mascara 
to open a Mary Kay factory, and 
Nick Cassavetes and Charlie
Sheen both tried to go for her 
groceries at the same time. Next 
she shows up in the immortal 
Zombie High (1987), where she 
further refined her Shakes
pearean acting techniques. Re
member Two Moon Junction, 
where she ripped her top off so 
many times I lost count?
She was destined to be a drivein superstar! And then what hap
pens? TV steals her away. Then 
Playboy puts her nekkid body all 
over the magazine.
And you know what that means?
Shes respectable now.
You understand this?
You used to pose for Playboy at 
the beginning of your career, when 
you were not respectable. Now you 
do it when youre a star, to prove 
youre respectable.
And then the next stage is, I 
dont do nudity anymore.
After you do the most public 
nudity there is.
Im still working on this. Im 
still trying to figure it out.
They wanna be called bimbos, 
and they dont wanna be called 
bimbos. They want me to see em 
nekkid, and they dont want me to 
see em nekkid.
So which is it? Please write in 
and help me out on this.
And speaking of women with 
Twin Peaks, Debra Sweaney stars 
in They Call Me Macho Woman. As 
the ad says, Bom to shop  I 
learned to kill. Debra Sweaney?
you say. You doubt me? Thats 
what they said about Sherilyn 
Fenn, too, when The Wraith came 
out four years ago.
Heres the deal. Debra drives 
out to the country with a weenie 
real-estate agent to look at a 
house, only once she gets there, 
she accidentally witnesses a gang 
of ruthless punk drug dealers 
loading several tons of cocaine 
into a Mercedes. Whoops! Uh-oh! 
And heres the best part: the head 
goon is Brian Oldfield, the Olym
pic shot-putter. He wears this 
steel band on his head with a 
unicorn spike coming out of the 
front so he can ram it through 
peoples foreheads whenever he 
feels like it.
An army of perverts takes off 
after Debra, chasing her through 
the woods for half the movie, until 
she files down a couple of axes, 
grabs a few steel spikes, and turns 
into Rambo With P.M. S. To give 
you some idea, theres this one 
scene where a Chinese guy breaks 
some bricks with his head, does a 
few flying leaps, kicks his leg 
straight up in the air within an 
inch of her body, and gives her an 
official warning: Black Belt. Ka
rate. Fifteen years.
She kicks his leg with her leg, 
which happens to have a six- inch 
metal spike attached to it, and 
says: Ballet. Six months.
No breasts. Nineteen dead bod
ies. Twig-through-the-ear. Fore

of The Beautiful South
Magnolias crops up in Pgh
By MICHAEL T. ROSE
Tartan Contributing Editor
When a band faces its second album, it 
faces the problem of overcoming expec;tations raised by the first record, justified 
or not. When the record is the acclaimed 
debut Welcome To the Beautiful South 
from British balladeers The Beautiful 
South, the second album becomes even 
more significant. It is a talisman of onehit-wonderhood or of continued success.
The recently released second album 
from The Beautiful South, simply en
titled Choke, says something about the 
self-image and confidence of the sixperson group. Mocking irony is, if not the 
core of The Beautiful Souths lyrical 
philosophy, then quite close to it.
Songwriters Paul Heaton and David 
Rotheray, late of the Housemartins, 
created an eerie, surreal humor on the 
ds first album with pieces like Song 
For Whoever, a lovely ballad about a 
songwriters emotional thievery, with 
gem lines like I love you from the bottom 
of my pencil case.... I love you till my 
fountain pen runs dry.
 Record Review 
 t:w*AY By The Beautiful South. 
Eiektra Entertainment.
Singers David Stead and Briana 
Corrigan, rarities among British pop, 
kept the lyrics poignantly clear on most 
tracks on Welcome To and agreeably 
bouncy on numbers like From Under 
The Covers and Woman In The Wall. 
The latter, an upbeat march tune about 
a rotting corpse sealed in a wall, fooled 
me many timesit wasnt until I looked 
very closely at the lyrics (... when the 
rotting flesh began to stink.... Make a 
grave from hoover bags) that I realized 
exactly what the song was about. This 
sort of dichotomy makes Welcome To an 
appealing, aggressively enjoyable album.
On Choke, the cynicism is if anything 
more pointed, the music more cheerful, 
and the overall effect certainly more dis
turbing. Choke has fewer tracks that 
might be considered danceable, but the 
lyrical subtlety is enhanced. The 
hammerblows heard on Welcome To are
transformed into dart attacks here.
Choke covers a wide swath of ground, 
with most songs on the album ending 
with a jab or ironic twist. The songs 
include an opener about masturbation 
called Tonight I Fancy Myself; an in
sane diarists prosody (My Book); an 
upbeat tune about shoplifting (Ive Come 
For My Award); and an interesting echo 
of the first album, which ended with a 
song called I Love You (But Youre Bor
ing)  Chokes final track is titled I 
Hate You (But Youre Interesting).
In truth, the two albums work better 
together than apart. Choke is both mel
lower and sharper than Welcome To, 
while the earlier effort has a certain 
first-timers sincerity that is appealing. 
Both are superb music from one of the 
foggy islands most intriguing bands.

For centuries playwrights have given 
us masterpieces about sorrowful events 
that yank at your every heart string and 
send you out of the theater emotionally 
drained, dabbing your eyes with a tissue. 
Other playwrights have offered side
splitting comedies where you spend the 
majority of your time gasping for breath. 
However, so few playwrights have suc
cessfully managed to put these two types 
of theater into one play.
Thats one of the qualities that makes 
Steel Magnolias such an extraordinary 
work. Not only does this play mix laugh
ter and tears to great effect, but novice 
playwright Robert Harling based it on 
one of the most tragic events in his life 
and he churned it out in only ten days.
The story centers around Shelby, a 
young Southern diabetic whose friends 
have gathered at the local beauty shop 
on her wedding day. The shops owner, 
Truvy, has just hired the mysterious but 
awkward Annelle as her new assistant. 
Rounding out the cast of characters are 
Clairee, a prominent and wealthy mem
ber of local society, and Ouiser, Clairees 
abrasive friend.

IdAA7 G4Uw7vGIY A comedy about six 
close friends living in a small Louisiana 
town. Starring Nancy Chesney and Robiri 
Walsh. At the Pittsburgh Playhouse, 222 
Craft Avenue, Oakland. Performances 
Tuesdays through Sundays until February 
10. Call 621-4445 for information.
As the plot unfolds, you will soon learn 
of the many obstacles these six women 
have quietly overcome, and how so often 
they have been deserted, both physically j 
and emotionally, by the men in their j 
lives. The worse the tragedy, the more; 
grace they seem to have in coping with it. (
S. Joseph Nassif will direct the produc-; 
tion of Steel Magnolias which will run at; 
the Pittsburgh Playhouse until Febru-j 
ary 10. Nancy Chesney stars as the stoic j 
mother MLynn, while Robin Walsh plays j 
her daughter and Shirley Tannenbaum j 
takes on the role of Truvy. Although this j 
play is about the lives and strengths ofj 
women, that shouldnt deter anyone from j 
seeing it. At its core, Steel Magnolias isj 
an inspired comedy, a moving drama,; 
and a rewarding experience for everyone.

I never did an opera before. 
Working with Robert Page is 
awesome. He is a wonderful con
ductor and very demanding. The 
experience should prove to be in
teresting, said Laura Duryea, a 
junior violist working on the 
Project.
All the work that has been put 
to by the students, the directors, 
and the designers of the sets and 
lighting systems will pay off very 
soon. The double casts have their 
makeup calls on Monday and 
Tuesday. On Wednesday there is 
a sitzprobe where the cast just 
runs through the music seated 
rather than moving about on
stage. Thursday and Friday are 
the dress rehearsals. The opera 
will be performed for an audience 
on Saturday night and next Mon
day night. The performance has 
the potential to be magnificent.
Its been beyond my wildest 
dreams,exclaimed Page. Its be
cause the students have risen to 
the occasion. There is such tre
mendous growth in the students. 
For anyone who teaches this is 
the most inspiring thing.
Sposi! Amici! Alb alio! Al gioco! 
Alle mine date foco! (Lovers and 
friends! Dance and be gay! Let joy 
light your faces!) The zest and 
humor of Marriage of Figaro will 
engage all in a musical venture 
that will not be forgotten.
Gibson excels as Hamlet
:G7Adc gm.s S/,i 7f9
and love this tale will immediately notice that the first scene 
when Hamlets father appears to 
nim as a ghost is cut and that the 
take thee to a nunnery speech 
was completely moved to another act.
in matter of fact, during the 
opening credits Zeffirelli and De 
Vore are credited for writing the 
8cript. Shakespeare is only 
toetioned in passing. Even though
these changes dont affect the film 
in any great way, they do nag the 
viewer enough to cause discom
fort.
Even with all the small prob
lems encountered in this film, 
Zeffirellis Hamlet is great cin
ema. With its nearly 400-year-old 
story, amazing scenery, and great 
acting by Gibson and BonhamCarter, this version of Hamlet 
probably would have made 
Shakespeare proud.

HAMLET
A FRANCO ZEFFIRELLI FILM
By MARK ROCES
Tartan Staffwriter
Space: the final frontier. These 
are the voyages of the starship ... 
Endocrine. Thats right, the En
docrine. And if you think thats 
a3t-that is amiss in this Trekkie 
spoof, author Leah Rewolinski has 
some more humorous surprises 
Mfeiting in Star Wreck: The Gen
eration Gap.
VRewolinski answers, in a 
roundabout way, the question of 
ju'st what would happen if the 
original Trek crew met up with 
their successors, the next gen
eration. Only, this is not Starfleet 
db'rnmand, nor is this the Enterpfthe. Instead, we are introduced 
fb^aptain Jean-Lucy Ricardo and 
fiis crew, serving under Starfreak 
Command, and dedicated to 
beldly go where nobody wanted 
tG$;o before.
 Book Review 
  IdG5 D5At*V d:A 4AU
A5GdvwU 4GBY By Leah Rewolinski. 
The old crew and the new crew 
collide in this hillarious parody of 
Star Trek.
They have received word that 
they will go on a joint mission 
with the Endocrines original 
captain James T. Smirk and his 
crew, who have found the secret 
of longevity in yogurt. And, just 
as the friction between the two 
crews builds, things get a little 
hectic when the Endocrine is 
pulled via a John Deere tractor 
beam to a planet inhabited by the 
Cellulites  obese humans on a 
hibernation diet.
The Cellulites wake from their 
sleep to the aroma of a Twinkie
which has been discarded by the 
young Ensign Westerly Flusher, 
and their eating binge reaches an 
alarming level as the starship re
mains trapped in the pull of the 
beam. As though this wasnt 
enough, Captain Smirk  the 
relentless socializer that he is  
decides to escape from the boring 
predicament with his crew in the 
cup of the ship (which normally 
rests on the ships saucer), and 
embark on a journey of endless 
party planets and female alien 
conquests. This leaves a very in
decisive Jean-Lucy Ricardo and 
his crew to ward off the Cellulites 
menacing appetites.
Rewolinski has a countless 
number of opportunities to spoof 
the two crews of the Enterprise, 
and she seems to do a relatively 
good and humorous job of it. She 
is quick to point out and exploit 
Captain Kirks relentless wornRewolinski answers, in a roundabout 
way the question of just what would 
happen if the original Trek crew met 
up with their successors.
anizing when Captain Smirk 
comments:
Whenever we encounter an 
alien race, I find the most hum anlooking female and court her. 
And who could forget Dr. 
McCoys constant exclamations of: 
Dammit Jim, Im a doctor, not
a.... and Mr. Scotts constant 
whining about how just how frag
ile the ship is. Both of these state
ments have become so prevalent 
that Dr. McCaw is proud to learn 
that his Im a doctor protests 
have been amended to the 
Hippocratic oath; and Mr. Snot is
surprised to find out that chief 
engineer Lt. Georgie Laforgery 
has no use for the Jargon Manual
 with which Mr. Snot makes up 
those excuses.
The next generation has its fair 
share of ridicule as well, as 
Rewolinski pokes fun at Number 
Ones dramatic poses and con
stant elaborations on the obvi
ous, and Captain Ricardos lack of 
authority and decisiveness.
Of course, there are elements in 
the book that are purely for 
humors sake, and Rewolinski is 
relatively successful at deliver
ing these jokes without causing 
much grief to the reader. Thereisl 
however, a seemingly endlesi 
amount of fun to be poked at the 
Trek clan which is neglected. Ever; 
figure out which girl got to weaij 
the jumpsuit and which got to 
wear the miniskirt and why? And 
what about those crumpled sheets 
of painted paper that are sup. 
posed to be stone walls? There are 
several opportunities f0^ 
Rewolinski to poke fun, instead of 
reiterating a joke already made 
several times.
Rewolinski also neglects sev
eral opportunities to contrast each 
characters counterparts and does 
little to develop those which she 
has. But on the whole, Star Wreck: 
The Generation Gap will give the 
reader plenty to laugh about, and 
in her parody, Leah Rewolinski 
has delightfully gone where no 
writer has gone before.

Next week the Tony-award-winning 
musical Grand Hotel will march into 
Pittsburgh. This spectacular musical 
brings the audience to a luxury hotel in 
Berlin in 1928, where the wealthy and 
the impoverished clash daily.
The old and cynical Doctor 
Otternschlag guides the audience 
through the hotel, introducing them to 
Flaemmchen, a young secretary who 
wants to be in pictures; Director Preysing, 
a middle-aged executive who is too easily 
seduced by corruption; and the dashing 
baron who is perpetually running from 
his violent creditors. These characters 
and others mix together within the con
fines of Grand Hotel.
Aside from plot, the main reasons to

Broadway. To give anyone considering 
this show extra incentive to go out and 
get a ticket, this may be your only chance 
to hear these great songs. Unlike most 
shows, the music for Grand Hotel has not 
yet been released as an album, because 
of some legal battles over the rights to 
the songs that may never be resolved. 
This is unfortunate, because once you 
see this show, youll want to hear the

The 22nd Tournee of 
Animation
Shown every year at the Pittsburgh Playhouse 
and then DH 2210, this years Tournee easily holds 
up to past ones in quality. Consisting of eighteen 
new animation shorts from around the world, all 
grounds are covered in this film  from comedy to 
music to serious drama. And even if you dont like 
(or in some cases understand) the plot for each short 
film, most of the animation processes used are 
amazing enough to keep your eyes and brain more 
than busy. Shorts to look for are any of the cartoons 
by Geroge Plimpton, Vykrutasy by Gerri Bardin 
which is completely animated with a wire coil, The 
Bedroom by Maarten Koopman, which animates 
the recreation of the famous painting by Van Gogh, 
and the Academy Award Nominee for Best Short 
Story, Balance.
So if you like award-winning animation, or just 
want to see a really good flick, then definitely check 
out The 22nd Tournee of Animation.

Mo Better Blues
Although not as controversial  nor as hard
hitting  as some of director Spike Lees previous 
outings, Mo Better Blues is still a decent movie. 
Denzel Washington plays a jazz trumpet player 
forced to choose between his music and two women, 
played by Cyndia Williams and Joie Lee. The story 
here is only fair, but the music is good and, of course, 
Lees direction is excellent. Watch in particular for 
one scene in which Washington isnt sure which 
woman hes sleeping with. Even with the DH 2210 
sound system, which probably wont do justice to 
the soundtrack, this flick is worth your dollar.

The Princess Bride
Who says fairy tales are only for children? Director 
Rob Reiner has taken the archetypal fairy tale story 
(from a novel written by William Goldman) and 
turned it into a heartwarming and entertaining 
comedy/romance which no one but the Grinch could 
hate.
Cary Elwes stars as Wesley, the poor farm boy 
who falls in love with the beautiful Buttercup (Robin 
Wright) and goes off to battle the forces of evil, 
befriend the downtrodden, andsave Buttercup from 
the dire fate of being forced to marry the oily Prince 
Humperdinck (Chris Sarandon). In their travels, 
Wesley and Buttercup run into such notables as 
Andre the Giant, Billy Crystal, Peter Falk, and, of 
course, Mandy Patinkin as Inigo Montoya, an ac
complished swordsman determined to avenge his 
fathers death. Keep your eyes and ears open when 
seeing this movie, or youll miss much of the humor 
which makes The Princess Bride appealing to all 
ages.
Seeing this film is definitely worth spending a 
dollar (and putting off your homework).

Conan the Barbarian
This is it  the movie which launched Arnold 
Schwarzenegers blockbuster movie career. Arnold 
stars as the sword-wielding warrior who seeks 
vengeance on the cult leader (James Earl Jones) 
who enslaved him and massacred the people of his 
village. Based on Robert E. Howards books, Conan 
the Barbarian is one of the few sword and sorcery 
movies which raises above the low-grade genre and 
really shines through. This is mainly due to Ron 
Cobbs spectacular production design, Basil 
Pouledoris vibrant score, and good acting by the 
entire cast.
If you like good sword fights, lots of blood, beau
tiful scenery, Arnold or James Earl Jones, then 
definitely check this flick out.
