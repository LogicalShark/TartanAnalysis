Fraternities change policy...
BYOB comes to campus

Students wishing to party it up at 
the fraternities this fall will have to 
bring a little more than just their party 
hats if they want to drink alcohol while 
they dance. All CMU fraternities will 
begin enforcing a policy of BYOB next 
semester, requiring guests to bring 
their own alcohol to parties rather 
than having the houses provide it for 
everyone.
Designed and implemented by the 
Interfraterity Council (IFC), the policy 
aims to alleviate financial burdens of 
individual fraternities as well as prob
lems of al- __________________________
c o h o 1 
abuse. The 
policy... [is] 
an effort to 
make [fra
ternity] 
policies
congruent __________________________
with each of
the fraternities national policies 
which are BYOB due to the provisions 
of their insurance carriers, said 
Janine Copolla, Coordinator of Resi
dence Life for Greek Affairs. CarKriegal of Kappa Delta Rho.
The policy is being designed ... to 
the credit of the men who are putting 
so much energy into bringing this 
about, with support from Copolla and 
other members of the Residence Life 
office, Murphy said.
Members of the IFC regard the new 
policy positively in its attempt to take 
. preventive measures against irrespon
sible drinking and their own liability. 
Change takes time and this is the 
first step, Polega said.
Junior CS major and president of 
Delta Tau Delta, Brant Partington, 
found the stricter policy inevitable due 
to an increase in societal awareness of 
alcohol abuse. [Serving alcohol to mi_________________________ nors] isnt
Right now we're break
ing the law...
 Christopher Ravin, 
risk manager of DTD
negie Mellon is one of the few univer
sities who has not adopted this policy 
when it was initiated by the national 
organizations in the mid 80s.
The policy is a long time in coming 
... I think its excellent in that the 
Greeks are policing themselves, said 
Greek Council President Jeff Polega, 
a junior ECE major.
.With BYOB in effect, guests who 
bring alcohol to a party will be issued 
a ticket for each beer they bring, which 
they can give to whomever they choose. 
The way it works is that if you dont 
bring beer and dont know anyone who 
will give you beer, then you cant get 
it, said Polega.
Despite previous enforcement, Dean 
of Student Affairs Michael Murphy 
finds the policy to be a result of the 
IFCs regard for national creeds. My 
sense is that the current team is par
ticularly committed to this strategy, 
he said.
Were one of the few Universities 
left that hasnt gone BYOB ... so we 
didnt have so much choice in the mat
ter, said the risk manager Jeremy
something 
that can 
keep hap
pening. Soci
ety is crack
ing down on 
the issue, 
he said.
From a
risk managers standpoint, its a 
great idea. Right now were breaking 
the law. With BYOB, if someone falls 
down our stairs were not held liable 
because we didnt serve him alco
hol, said junior biology major Chris
topher Ravin, risk manager of Delta 
Tau Delta.
As to the influences that BYOB might 
impose upon CMUs social scene, Ravin 
predicts negative effects in parties as 
well as the overall growth of the Greek 
system. Some people seem to think 
that kids arent as interested in drink
ing, but lessening the emphasis of 
drinking [alcohol] will make fraterni
ties no different from any other orga
nization on campus, he said.
Yet many disagree with Ravins 
view of Greek life and the impor
tance that alcohol carries within the 
system.
With BYOB, fraternities will have 
the chance to remove some of the 
stigmas that tend to be associated 
with it.
Im indifferent to the policy since 
it is only one aspect of a fraternity, 
said Partington. Its probably the 
least [significant] reason why I joined 
a fraternity in the first place.
BYOB will increase rush numbers

What dont you like about CMU? Thats 
what we have been asking lots of people 
this year. Though the specific answers 
differ, the common theme is that the 
administration seems to be out of touch. 
Policies have been established that dont 
reflect the needs and desires of the stu
dent body. For instance, the University 
parking committee voted to raise parking 
rates by over 20 percent in some student 
parking lots while only raising rates in 
administrative parking lots by about two 
percent. Also, the alcohol enforcement 
policy was changed without getting any

This is a new approach to leadership 
at Carnegie Mellon. Rather than just

The other candidates are current

The students of the Seminar in the 
History of CMU class painted the fence 
yesterday in honor of Edward R. Schatz, 
senior vice president, who died at the 
age of 74 last Saturday.
Schatzs many titles did not earn 
him the respect and friendship of his 
co-workers and students. Rather, it 
was his endless commitment to CMU 
which endeared him to those who knew 
him.
Steven L. Calvert, assistant vice presi
dent for development and director of 
alumni relations said, Ed Schatz came 
to the University as a freshman in 1939 
and never left. I was very fond of him as 
I looked at him as the village elder. I 
miss him very much already.
Vice President for Enrollment Bill 
Elliot remembers the guidance Schatz 
gave him. Elliot said, He in a sense was 
the surrogate father of Bill Elliot at 
Carnegie Mellon.... He was a guy I al
ways went to and talked about stuff, 
whether about the office or me. He was 
a guy I could honestly share with.
In a career that spanned more than 
half of CMUs existence, Schatzs most 
recent work included managing the con
struction of the new University Center 
and teaching the Seminar in the History 
of CMU class.
Thomas Murphy, senior project man
ager, admired Schatzs direction in 
the construction of the University Cen
ter. Ed didnt have a construction 
background of any kind, but he brought 
so much insight into the project and 
kept us focused, Murphy said. His 
first interest and considerations were 
always for the students and flaking 
[the University Center] the best for 
them. Every meeting, he reminded us 
of this [goal].
Maryann Moore, director of special 
events, also worked with Schatz on 
the University Center and points to 
Schatzs efforts as being the key to the 
construction efforts. She said, I had
respect for him in the past, but my 
respect for him just blossomed signifi
cantly. The level of dedication and 
commitment that man had was phe
nomenal and I can honestly say that 
one of the primary reasons that build
ing is standing now is because of Ed 
Schatz.
Schatz was equally admired by the 
students of the Seminar in the History 
of CMU class he was jointly teaching 
this semester with Edwin Ted 
Fenton, director of university out
reach.
Edward Slavishak, a senior social his
tory major in Schatzs seminar class, 
said, Although Ive only known Ed for 
three months or so, I truly feel the loss of 
this great person. He changed the way I 
look at CMU and represents to me the 
very spirit of this University  confi
dently and capably striving for set goals 
while always willing to change course if 
necessary.
Other students point to the ease with

NEA Chairman speaks at Carnegie \~R^ib^th7^ii^.
By BECKY A. COWSER
I Tartan News Editor
During her hour-long speech at 
the Carnegie Music Hall, Jane 
| Alexander, Chairman for the 
National Endowment for the Arts 
i (NEA), cited Pittsburgh and Car- I negie Mellon as inspirations when 
j it comes to successfully combin| ing technology and the arts, 
j Alexander made her third trip to 
Pittsburgh last Thursday when 
3he visited the CMU Arts Man
agement facilities at the Heinz 
School and spoke about recent 
developments at the Endowment.
Our challenge today is to re
claim authentic experience, said 
Alexander. While I am excited 
about the possibilities that all 
the new technologies offer us in 
j sharing information and educa
tion, there is a palpable loss if we 
let technology swamp commu
nity, if we let virtual reality re- I place whats really real.
Alexander explained how the 
Manchester Craftsmens Guild on 
the North Side of Pittsburgh has 
! Worked with CMU to create a 
: convergence of technology and the 
f arts that is effective and benefi
cial. With the help of CMU, 
Manchester set up its own World 
Wide Web site where people can 
now watch the progress of cre
ative artwork that students are 
doing.
Alexander also explained how 
the City of Pittsburgh has earned 
itself a spot on the NEAs World 
Wide Web site. It is the first com
munity featured in Focus on 
Community, a section of NEAs 
monthly on-line magazine located 
at its Web site arts.community at 
arts.endow.gov.
The Pittsburgh Town Meeting 
provided an opportunity for 
Alexander to introduce a million 
dollar initiative that will utilize 
the forces of both the NEA and 
the Benton Foundation. 
Alexander pointed out that the 
initiative has two major goals, 
the first of which is to provide 
free public arts points of access 
in all 50 states. These points of 
access would allow places for art
ists, administrators, and the pub
lic to obtain the rich, cultural 
variety available on the hundreds 
of arts-related Web sites.
The second goal of the initia
tive is to create Community Web
Mentoring partnerships like the 
one set up by CMU and Manches
ter. The intent of this program is 
to set up 10 pilot programs where 
a major civic institution would 
mentor small arts organizations 
and individual artists in develop
ing and maintaining their own 
Web sites. In this way, a univer
sity like CMU can become a focal 
point, a gathering place for arts 
administrators and artists to 
come together and interact. Our 
intent is to wire these communi
ties together, and in the process 
of achieving technological lit
eracy, we create a hub-and-spoke 
interlinking relationship for all 
involved. When we make the pub
lic announcement of the Commu
nity Web Mentoring Initiative in 
May, it is my hope and belief that 
CMU will be one of the ten sites. 
You were our inspiration, after 
all, Alexander said.

Plane crash takes life 
of seven-year-old pilot
SAN FRANCISCO, April 12 (AP)  
Despite her tiny voice and elfin build, 7- 
year-old Jessica Dubroff had big ideas.
When she flew out of Half Moon Bay 
Airport on Wednesday she wore a red 
baseball cap that said, Women Fly.
; Her baseball hat, her charisma  
she was seven-years-old going on 20, 
said a choked-up Jack McHugh, who 
delivered a bouquet of flowers to the 
airport near Pescadero, a coastal town 
where Jessica lived about 40 miles 
south of San Francisco.
Jessica, her father, Lloyd Dubroff, 
nd flight instructor Joe Reid were killed
Thursday as ________________________
they took off in 
rain and snow 
in Cheyenne,
Wyo. Jessica 
was trying to 
Become the 
youngest person to make a cross-country flight.
She became hooked on flying after 
her parents took her on an airplane 
ride for her sixth birthday. She had 
taken four months of lessons and had 
logged about 35 flight hours before the 
cross-country trip.
Im going to fly till I fly solo, she 
told The Associated Press last week. 
Fly till I die.
 Jessica, who was four-foot-two and 
weighed just 55 pounds, sat in a red 
booster seat so she could see over the 
planes dashboard. She used alumi
num extensions to help her reach the 
rudder pedals.
I'm going to fly till I fly 
solo....
 Jessica Hathaway
Reid, president of the Half Moon 
Bay Pilots Association, sat next to her 
in the Cessna 177B Cardinal. The four
seater had two sets of controls in case 
Jessica needed assistance.
Mentally, she grasps the concepts 
as well as an adult, Reid had said.
Jessicas father had said that the 
money he saved on tuition at a private 
school could be used for flying lessons.
Asked last week if his daughters 
flying made him nervous, he said, 
Im actually more nervous about her 
riding horses.
Jessica, Joshua and their 3-year-old 
_______________________ sister, Jas
mine, lived 
with their 
mother, Lisa 
Blair 
Hathaway. 
Their father 
lived in nearby 
San Mateo with his current wife.
Given the chance to change things, 
Jessicas mother said she would not 
have stopped her daughter.
I beg people to let children fly if 
they want to fly, Hathaway said 
Thursday while in Falmouth, Mass., 
before heading to Cheyenne. She had 
come to the familys original home
town of Falmouth from California to 
greet her daughter, who had planned 
a stop there.
Later at the airport, a teary 
Hathaway added, Clearly I would 
want all my children to die in a state 
of joy, but not at age 7.
Boxing champ probed 
in sexual assault case
INDIANAPOLIS, April 12 (AP)  
A year after his release from prison, 
Mike Tyson has been restricted to 
his home state of Ohio while Chi
cago police investigate a complaint 
that he sexually assaulted a woman 
in a nightclub.
 Tyson, on probation for a 1992 rape 
conviction, may leave Ohio only for 
emergencies or reasons approved in 
advance, said George Walker, chief 
probation officer for Marion County, 
Ind., where Tyson served three years 
Of a six-year sentence for rape.
Tyson, who last month regained the 
World Boxing Council heavyweight 
title, probably will be allowed to leave 
July 13 for a fight scheduled in Las 
Vegas, if the investigation is still on, 
Walker said Thursday.
; Tyson, 29, was convicted of raping 
Desiree Washington, a Coventry, R.I.,
college student who had been compet
ing in the Miss Black America? pageant 
in Indianapolis. He was released from 
prison in March 1995, and is now on a 
four-year probationary term.
If Tyson were to be charged in Chi
cago, he could be returned to prison for 
up to four years, Indiana corrections 
officials said.
A 25-year-old Gary, Ind., woman 
claimed Tuesday that she met Tyson 
at The Clique, a popular Chicago night
club, and that he kissed and bit her 
face, touched an unspecified part of 
her body, and forced her to touch him 
in a private room at the club.
Her lawyer, Jerry Lee Peteet, said 
the clubs owner offered to bring 
Tyson a woman he could have sex 
with in a private VIP area on the 
third floor, New Yorks Daily News

BEIRUT, Lebanon, April 12 (AP)  
Israeli helicopters fired missiles on 
Beiruts slums today in an effort to 
wreck the nerve center of Lebanese 
guerrillas.
Witnesses said six missiles hit a Syr
ian army position and wounded at least
12 Syrian soldiers.
The air raid on Beirutthe second on 
the Lebanese capital in two days  was 
the latest round in an escalating cycle of 
violence. Earlier today, Hezbollah guer
rillas bombarded northern Israel with 
rockets, and Israel retaliated by barraging suspected guerrilla bases in south
ern Lebanon.
Witnesses in Lebanon said six rockets 
fired by Israeli aircraft struck a Syrian 
encampment on a seaside highway lead
ing to the Beirut international airport. 
Israel army reported that the airport 
was closed.
Earlier in the day, Lebanese guerril
las pounded northern Israel with rock
ets, and Israeli warplanes struck back 
by bombarding suspected guerrilla bases 
in southern Lebanon.
The guerrilla rockets, fired in retali
ation for Israeli attacks on Thursday, 
damaged homes in the border town of 
Kiryat Shemona and wounded at least 
four people, one of them seriously.
Lebanese security sources said eight 
civilians were killed when 60 shells 
rained down on the guerrilla-controlled 
town of Sohmor in the Bekaa Valley.
Six civilians were wounded by artil
lery fire on Sohmor and the Syriangarrisoned town of Machghara, also in 
the southern Bekaa, they said.
The raids Thursday in Beirut and other 
Hezbollah strongholds in eastern and 
southern Lebanon killed six people and 
wounded 18, according to Lebanese po
lice.
Hezbollah vowed to avenge the at
tacks, and retaliation was swift. Hard
est hit in the rocket attacks today was 
the Israeli community of Kiryat 
Shemona, where more than a dozen 
rockets fell in three different areas as 
residents emerged from underground 
shelters to shop for the weekend.
Rockets also hit fields in western 
Galilee, and struck Marjayoun, a Leba
nese border town that serves as a head
quarters for Israeli troops and an al
lied Lebanese militia. No injuries were 
reported.

ers fired after going on a three-day strike 
at some of Beverly Enterprises Inc.s 15 
Pennsylvania nursing homes demon
strated Thursday outside a bank repre
senting investors in the chain.
About 75 members of the Service 
Employees International Union dem
onstrated outside Mellons headquar
ters. They shouted, No justice! No 
peace! The lunchtime crowd at One 
Mellon Center paid little attention.
The union said it went on strike last 
week over restrictions on what em
ployees could tell patients families 
about conditions at Beverly homes, 
including allegations of inadequate
%
staffing and late meals.
Beverly Enterprises has said workers 
were warned they could be fired. It called 
the strike an economic matter because 
the SEIU has not had a contract with 
Beverly since last fall.
Picketers said they were concerned 
about leaving behind patients they en
joyed helping.
We all worked together, and it was 
like one big family. I liked working there. 
It was hard work, but you did what you 
had to do, said dietary aide Roberta

WASHINGTON, April 12 (AP)  The 
estate offormer President Nixon agreed 
today to release almost 3,700 hours of 
still-unheard White House tapes, many 
made while Nixon was embroiled in the 
Watergate scandal that endedhis presi
dency.
To date, only 63 hours of tapes had 
been available for public listening.
The first release under the new 
agreement, approximately 201 hours 
dealing with abuses of government 
power, are expected as early as No
vember.
The second release, with a time not 
set, involves 278 hours of tapings re
corded in the White House Cabinet 
Room.
I am elated. We won, said history 
professor Stanley I. Kutler of the Uni
versity of Wisconsin at Madison.
All of us who believe in open gov
ernment and full disclosure of our his
tory are the real winners today, said 
Kutler. He sued for release of the tapes 
in 1992.
Secret taping systems that recorded
both conversations on the telephone and' 
among people in the Oval Office and; 
other locations were revealed duringj 
Senate Watergate hearings.
Nixon ultimately lost a battle beforej 
the Supreme Court with the Watergate! 
special prosecutor over release to al 
grand jury of portions of the tapes. !
Contents of the tapes ultimately led to1 
a House Judiciary Committee vote! 
recommeding Nixons impeachment. He 
resigned Aug. 9, 1974, rather than be 
impeached.
The agreement was filed today in 
U.S. District Court in Washington, i
In a joint news release, the parties' 
said it resolves all other issues grow-1 
ing out of a lawsuit brought against! 
the National Archives and Record Ad-j 
ministration in March 1992 by Profes
sor Kutler and Public Citizen, a good-j 
government.
In an interview in 1992, Kutler, au
thor of a book, The Wars of 
Watergate, said he did not know if 
people would really learn definitively 
why there was a break-in at Demo
cratic Party headquarters in the 
Watergate office complex on June 17, 
1972.
What I thinkis that the whole revela-l 
tion of the record will show the extent of! 
Richard Nixons involvement, he said.' 
Fifty years from now, we will know that! 
it was Richard Nixon who was at thej 
heart of the matter.

50 YEARS AGO, April 16, 
1946: The Campus Queen at 
Spring Carnival was chosen from 
the seven members of the elected 
Court of the Campus Queen. 
Rather than have the candidates 
meet the judges on a stage in an 
impersonal manner, they metthe 
judges at a luncheon that was 
attended by the Coronation Com
mittee. In making their selection 
after the luncheon, the judges 
considered personality, popular
ity, and scholarship in addition 
to beauty.
25 YEARS AGO, April 15, 
1971: The number of freshman 
applications for admission into 
C-MU was off 18 percent from 
the previous year. In 1971, only 
2769 students had applied, com
pared with 3390 from the previ
ous year. There was no way to 
know for sure why there was 
such a large decline in the ap
plication pool.
The number of applications to 
the school had been on a steady 
decline over the past 10 years. 
There were several speculations 
to the decline including the ex
pense of attending C-MU and
the quality of education. Other 
technological schools such as 
MIT, Lehigh, and RPI were also 
experiencing a decline in appli
cations. Carnegies tuition was 
$2500 at the time, which was 
about the same as other private 
institutions.
There was also speculation that 
a tough job market was discour
aging students from technically 
oriented courses.
10 YEARS AGO, April 15, 
1986: M-TV announced that 
CMU students would get a free 
concert for their fund-raising 
drive to fight MS. With a final 
total of $23,664.32, Carnegie 
Mellon raised more money than
any other school. M-TV had not 
yet chosen a performer for the 
concert.
The fund-raising effort was 
supported by proceeds from 
Greek Sing, the Rock-alike con
test, several fraternity/sorority 
parties, and the Miracle Mile at 
Station Square, organized by the 
Student Government President. 
Students with CMU IDs could 
get one or two tickets on a firstcome-first-serve basis. Remain
ing tickets would be sold at a pre
set price with the proceeds 
benefitting MS.
FIVE YEARS AGO, April 15, 
1991: Carnegie Mellon hosted its 
first track meet on the new
Gesling Stadium track. The invi-^ 
tational was the track teams* 
warm up for the University Ath
letic Association Championship 
meet.
Approximately 20 teams from . 
all divisions participated in the; 
meet, includingUniversity ofPitts-, 
burgh, West Virginia University, 
and Frostburg University. The 
meet was originally scheduled to. 
take place at Clarion University, 
but the site was changed due to , 
scheduling problems.
The new track proved to be , 
very fast as several teams quali-,, 
fied for national championships.

route, improving campus parking 
through garage expansion, and bet'teringthe campus appearance. I will 
*' also work to increase popular enter1 tainment options, increase commu
nity service and outreach options,
Q and to create an alcohol policy that 
satisfies the students. I will also de
velop an electronic survey and infor
mation system to get your opinions 
and let you know what is happening 
ALL of the time. This system will put 
the most important decisions in your 
hands. By bringing the choices to 
"you, I will give you the power to^ 
: change this campus.

student input.
What will we focus on? We want to give 
you greater power to influence change on 
this campus. In short, very few structures 
on this campus give students a voice to the 
administration. Rather than make prom
ises, we will focus on one issue that has a 
lasting impact at CMU.
How will we get students this increased 
influence?
1. Form Student Advisory Commit
tees (SACs) for University offices. The 
administration isnt fully aware of what 
students think. The current system 
doesnt give students the ability to have 
much administrative influence. So, well 
work with the major University offices 
(like the President, the Parking Office, 
the Career Center, and Computing Ser
vices) to create these SACs.
2. Require reports from SACs and Uni
versity committees each semester explain
ing what the committee is working on and 
has accomplished. This way the commit
tees and administration will be account
able to you.
3. Form a Presidential Advisory Com
mittee. One student from each college 
will be selected to work with studentb1iydoaz
glpnmife usEd o[.N h
part of an imperfect system. Instead of 
fixing the system, they have tried to 
work with arrive on campus half of an 
hour early for class or arrive just as 
class was beginning. I worked out a 
plan with Sgt. Ricci and Chief LaPaglia 
to run the shuttle on the quarter and 
the three-quarter hour. Now the 
shuttle arrives/departs at 9:45 and 
10:15. The students are happy with 
the new, more logical schedule. The 
system was broken, and I helped fix it.
I now want to adjust how the Activities 
Fee money is allocated. Nearly all organi
zations agree that the current system is 
faulty. My solution is to allow each stu
dent to earmark part of their fee for a 
particular organization. The remainder 
of the money will remain in the general 
fund to be doled out by Senate. This sysgoverament to keep us aware of major 
issues in that college and to coordi
nate Student Government work on 
issues that affect specific colleges.
4. Increase involvement with Fac
ulty Senate, Graduate Student Orga
nization, Student Dormitory Council, 
and student organizations. Many of 
these groups have similar goals. We 
hope to help coordinate efforts on is
sues and events that will benefit the 
whole campus.
As Senate Chairs, what have our 
committees accomplished?
a) Surveyed students for opinions 
on Scotland Yard, MLK Day, the text
book store, and finals regulations.
b) Convinced the textbook store to 
consider a policy of matching the prices 
on any textbook sold at a lower price in 
the Pittsburgh area.
c) Convinced Senate to pass a recom
mendation to cancel classes on MLK 
Day.
Why us?
You deserve more than just good 
ideas and empty promises. You de
serve a President and a Vice Presi
dent who will produce results.
tem will allow the organizations which 
many students support to flourish. The 
smaller organizations and the largest 
campus wide organizations such as The 
Tartan, WRCT, and AB will not be 
forgotten. All organizations which need 
more funds will present a budget to 
Senate as before. This system will be 
beneficial to all organizations.
The Student Body President cannot 
make these changes alone. I will ap
point a committee to work out the ideas 
and present them to Senate. If our 
proposal is voted down by Senate, I will 
circulate a petition to the student body 
to force a change the current system. 
The system is broken and we will fix it.
Thank you for your interest in stu
dent government. Please remember 
to vote during Carnival.
Director of SEI steps down from position
"/ don't think we'll ever be 
able to replace Larry in the 
way he has built the SEI... 
 Julia Allen, 
SEI Deputy Director
By KENNETH J. KRAEMER
Tartan Editor-in-Chief
Carnegie Mellon is looking for a new 
director to head up its acclaimed Soft
ware Engineering Institute (SEI). Dr. 
Larry Druffel announced his resignation 
from the top leadership position at the 
SEI, on March 27, effective May 6. Druffel 
will be ending his ten-year position as the 
first director of the highly successful In
stitute. I dont think well ever be able to 
replace Larry in the way he has built the
SEI, said __________________________
Julia Allen,
Deputy Direc
tor of the SEI.
[There are 
times when] 
you ought to 
think about a 
new direc
tion, said 
Druffel, citing 
that he had
not been actively seeking a new position 
outside the SEI. In his position, he has 
seen lots of opportunities, and his re
cent offer from the South Carolina Re
search Authority (SCRA) proved to be 
perfect. It seemed like a natural for 
me, said Druffel.
According to Allen, the nature of the 
SEI is such that its employees and asso
ciates work on different projects for rela
tively short periods of time, and then 
leave the Institute. [When] people stay 
here too long, theyre not fresh, said 
Allen. She went on to explain that the 
constant change in staff at the SEI is 
necessary to insure the constant gen
eration of new ideas.
In fact, Druffel had not expected to 
be at the SEI for so long. [I thought I 
would] stay for a short time and then 
move on, he said. Members of the 
SEIs Board of Visitors, similar in na
ture to the Universitys Board of Trust
ees, said, We were surprised [Druffel] 
stayed this long.... citing that the stan
dard tenure for the leadership of a 
technical organization such as the SEI
is typically four to six years.
Druffels resignation follows the an-;, 
nouncement from the SCRA that its: 
Board of Trustees had elected him the, 
new president, director and CEO of the  
research firm.
[The position] will be a broadening 
experience for me, remarked Druffel, 
continuing to say that the SCRAs work ; 
in economic development through tech
nology seemed exciting. According to 
Allen, Druffel is a techie at heart, and 
the new position will offer him new
___________________________ technology
challenges. 
Druffel ex
pressed hapr 
piness in the 
prospect of 
working in a 
non-govern,- 
ment funded 
organization. 
Over the 
past three to 
four years, explained Druffel, there 
has been perceived aggression in other 
FFRDCs [Federally-Funded Research 
and Development Centers]. Although 
according to Druffel the SEI is not a 
transgressor, The constraints resultingfrom FFRDC aggression has resulted 
in considerable constraints placed on 
all FFRDCs. According to Druffel, Run
ning one [FFRDC] can be onerous.
The SCRA is a 16-year-old not-forprofit firm that specializes in economic 
improvement through technology 
through both government and private 
and public projects. Based in Columbia, 
South Carolina, the firm began with 
initial land-grants supplied by the state, 
and was chartered to develop high-techr 
nology programs and research parks. ..
Druffel offered numerous reasons for 
his decision to leave the SEI, summariz
ing, Ive done for the organization what 
[Druffel] can.
More specifically, he feels that he 
has gotten too far away from the tech
nology. [When] managing, to stay

proached with problems. Steven 
Woyicki, a senior industrial man
agement major said, Youd think 
that since he was so acclaimed 
that he would be hard to approach and intimidat
ing, but he was always 
easy to approach and 
enthusiastic.
Schatz earned all 
three of his degrees in 
Electrical Engineering 
at CMU, then known 
as Carnegie Tech, in
cluding his doctorate 
ini949. He was amainstay at the University 
except for a few years 
in the 40s, when he 
worked on the Manhat
tan Project.
He held nearly ev
ery position includ
ing Provost, Acting 
President, and most 
recently Senior Vice President, 
He is viewed by many as being 
representative of CMU.
Herbert A. Simon, professor 
of computer science and psy
chology, said, Ed had a deep 
interest in teaching, and was
one of those on campus who 
kept alive the Carnegie Plan
 the emphasis on problem 
solving in education that was 
conceived here in the 30s and is 
now again receiving consider
able attention as the key to our 
efforts to improve undergradu
ate instruction.
Fenton said, I think Ed epito
mizes the history of this place. He 
made contributions to almost ev
ery aspect of the university. He was 
a fine teacher, veiy good adminis
trator, department head, dean, and 
provost. He was a major contribu
tor financially and in every way. 
Were going to miss him terribly. 
In addition to working at the 
University, Schatz was on the 
board for the Western Pennsylva
nia School for the Deaf since 1974.
He is survived by his wife, 
Virginia, daughter, Eleanor, 
and son, George. A memorial 
service is planned, however no

Drummers protest military contracts
Ag JENNY GARCIA 
de OSUNA
Forum Editor
/Drums of Peace, a weekendlong protest held on Carnegie 
Mellons campus, marks Vincent 
Eirenes 12th year of opposition 
to CMUs military contracts.
From Friday afternoon to 
Sunday, the CMU campus was 
continuously filled with the 
sounds of drums as students 
and protesters from the African 
Drum Ensemble, the Art Insti
tute, high schools, and others, 
led by Eirene got together for a 
Weekend of peace in an attempt 
to get the issues of war and 
research known throughout the 
CMU community.
Eirene, founder of Pittsburgh 
DMZ, feels that the research 
money Carnegie Mellon Univer
sity is using to create war weap
ons should be used instead to 
research issues that would help 
humanity, not destroy it.
The CMU community should 
be ashamed of themselves for
not trying to eliminate such re
search that threatens the fu
ture, said Eirene.
An example of the weaponry 
being protested is a robot heli
copter under development in Ro
botics. The helicopter would be 
able to perform high risk tasks 
without endangering the life of 
the pilot. Machines like this are 
the reason for Eirenes protests.
Even the event lasted all week
end, it seemed that the CMU 
campus did not get that mes-, 
sage. Most students thought the 
Drums of Peace protest was a 
random gathering of students 
and other people getting together 
in peace and music.
I felt that it was a great event 
and all who joined were people 
with beautiful auras  the 
drums were an extension of that 
aura, said John Paul, engineer
ing and public policy major. It 
was great to see people get to
gether in that way.
I liked that it was not struc
tured, said Joanna Phillips, ar
chitecture major. It was con
tinuous and free, it got people 
involved. Once I joined in, I 
couldnt stay away.
I took a break from studio at 
5 am and was amazed that 
something was going on at cam
pus. We spend too much time 
behind a computer or in studio 
and we never know what is go
ing on in the outside world, 
said Phillips.
Although the outcome seemed 
a success, Eirene still feels that 
these years have shown no 
progress.
I feel like the energizer 
bunny, said EirenS. I see no 
progress; research is needed 
along human lines  AIDS and 
other health issues, not on find
ing new and exotic ways of kill
ing each other.
BYOB takes effect next semester
H,tHe usEd o[.N h
since the focus of Greek life as 
a whole be more visible, accord
ing to Copolla. The focus of 
Greek Life should not be only 
social opportunities afforded to 
individuals that join, but on 
leadership development, com
munity service, academic ex
cellence, and life-long friend
ships, she said.
A number of houses support 
BYOB because of the financial 
impact it holds for the houses. 
It will save [us] money, said 
Partington. With the cost of 
housing, most fraternities have 
money problems.
Neither Copolla nor Murphy 
expect the policy to end under
age drinking on campus, but 
without such blatant resources, 
students will be forced to make 
deliberate decisions in social 
settings.
The policy is designed to in
crease personal responsibility. 
I ... anticipate that this will 
encourage those who may le
gally buy alcohol to take that 
privilege seriously and to not 
[create] risk by providing alco
hol to those who are not of age, 
Murphy said.
Parties in the fall will not be 
the first at which BYOB is en
forced; a few houses have tried 
to hold similar parties, which 
created mixed feelings among 
houses.
Kappa Delta Rho hosted an 
experimental BYOB party, as 
did Pi Kappa Alpha with Delta 
Tau Delta. Partington didnt 
find any differences due to 
BYOB in the social atmo
sphere of the party or in the 
amount of drinking that went 
on in the quad. I assume 
people just went to other 
places to drink before they 
came here, he said.
Many non-Greeks on campus 
consider this a chance to expe
rience other facets of the Greek 
system, yet fear administrative 
influence over student organi
zations. I feel like its a form of 
neo-Nazism coming into effect, 
said alumni Jesse Klemmer. 
Alcohol is a tension reliever  
where will it go now?
BYOB will be better in the longrun since the fraternities will be 
more accessible to more students, 
said Marchel Alexanderovich, a 
sophomore Industrial Manage
ment major.
Senior IDS major Scott Pitkin
sees the combination of BYOB 
and the new alcohol policy as an 
effective precaution to take 
against irresponsibility in th$ 
quad, but as to any long-ternj 
effects, drinkers will find way 
to side step the policy. Now 
people will just drink more in 
their dorm rooms. Thats not 
going to change much, he said.
Im certain that [the policy] 
will help change the culture of 
Greek life on campus, said 
Copolla.
Brendan Clarke, president of 
IFC, was unavailable for com-, 
ment.

about time

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  15 April 1996
Debate allows candidates 
opportunity to voice ideas
By CHRIS CANNON
Tartan News Assistant Editor 
& BECKY A. COWSER
Tartan News Editor
Carnegie Mellons three presidential 
candidates spoke to a sparse crowd in 
the Adamson Wing last Thursday night 
at 7pm. The presidential debate was an 
attempt to familiarize the student body 
with the candidates and their platforms, 
but it only drew about 20 people.
The presidential candidates Bryon 
Krug and his running mate Katie Hart,
Michael Rosenthal, and Mike Szudarek 
spoke for two hours about the student 
activities fee, the role of student govern
ment in campus life, and other topics.
The candidates opened with their 
official platforms. The formal debate 
followed, moderated by Barbara 
Prevost. Public Relations Chairman 
Rosenthal said at last weeks Senate 
meeting that the candidates would re
spond to questions pre-written by the 
PR committee, as well as questions 
submitted formally from the audience 
during the debate.
Each candidate emphasized that bet
ter lines of communication need to be 
established between administration and 
students, as well as between various 
student organizations. Rosenthal in
sisted that it was time for students to 
take back the University, while Krug 
commented on the powerlessness that 
most students feel when it comes to 
representation by student government.
Szudarek said that the majority of stu
dents do care, they have just become 
cynical and jaded because of years of 
poor representation.
The candidates also expressed concern 
about how the Student Activities Pee is 
currently being used, and each discussed 
a plan for implementing a new way of
Crime and Incident Report
handling students' fees. AH the candi
dates expressed a desire to raise the fee.
Szudarek believes that students should 
be able to earmark part of their fee to go 
toward an activity that they personally 
choose. The idea of earmarking has been 
floating around, but no ones ever pressed 
it.... We have to show the students that 
theyre getting their moneys worth, he 
said.
After the debate period there was an 
informal question and answer session.' 
One question posed was about how Sen
ate could become more effective in their 
representation of the student body.
Inthepast, StudentGovemmentwasnt 
really getting much accomplished, Krug 
said. [But] now people are going to start 
to realize that Student Government is the 
place to go to get things done.
Rosenthal said,There are a lot of Sen
ate groups who just dont care. [But with
out committees] one person cant effec
tively communicate everything that is 
going on on this campus.
In their closing statements the candi
dates summed up their positions and the 
reasons why they would each make the 
best student body president.
The student body president should be 
a liason between Senate, administra
tion, and the students, said Krug.
Information is one of the keys to lead
ership at this University.... We need a 
leader that can take the information that 
is available and put it forth to the right 
people, said Rosenthal.
The candidates agreed that their 
views were quite similar. Krug said, 
What its all going to come down to is 
whos going to implement these meth
ods the best. The event, held in antici
pation of the elections during Carni
val, was broadcast on WRCT yester
day at 3 pm and will be rebroadcast 
this Thursday at 4 pm.
Cancer claims life of Professor Emeritus
By SAVXT TEWARI
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
The math department recently hon
ored Professor Emeritus Ignace Izaak 
Kolodner, a man who had taught at 
CMU for 27 years by presenting him 
with a plaque for his dedication. Sadly, 
Kolodner succumbed to pancreatic can
cer last Tuesday at the age of seventyKolodner is also remembered 
as a man who wanted to change 
things forthe better. Mathemat
ics professor David Owen said, 
When he first came [to CMU], 
he tried to get funding from the 
government to expand the de
partment. He ultimately did get 
it, but unfortunately in a year or 
two that funding was stopped. 
_______________ Of his teaching
He had a terrific spirit even 
though he knew the end was
near.
James Greenberg
six. He had an impact on everyone 
here.... It really is a great loss, said 
Victor Mizel, professor of mathemat
ics.
Kolodner was born in Warsaw, Po
land. He obtained his Ph.D. in Math 
from New York University in 1950. 
Before coming to CMU as head of 
the department in 1964, he taught 
for nine years at the University of 
New Mexico. He remained head of 
department until 1971, and a mem
ber of faculty until 1990 when he 
retired. He was well liked and re
spected by the professors who had 
worked with him.
Professor of mathematics, Juan 
Schaffer, knew Kolodner since 1964 
and remembers him fondly as an 
extremely intelligent and hard work
ing man. He loved solving prob
lems. His command of classical 
analysis and teaching were ex
tremely outstanding. He was always 
polishing the educational aspects, 
Schaffer said. I judge him favorably 
as a department head, colleague and 
friend.
Owen com
mented, He 
was very struc
tured and orga
nized. He had a 
high degree of 
elegance in for
mulating and 
solving prob
lems. The Math Studies course 
today for the undergraduates 
was designed... by him and con
tinues to this day.
Professor of mathematics 
James Greenberg said, I was 
an assistant professor when I 
came here, and he was a good 
guy for a young man to work for. He 
was at all times trying to do the best 
for the members of the department. 
He was totally committed with a clear 
vision of where things should go. 
Kolodner kept himself busy even dur
ing his illness. [He had] terrific spirit 
even though he knew the end was 
near, Greenberg said.
In recent months, Kolodner was in 
the process of writing his memoirs. 
Mizel said ofhim, He was not going to 
let the illness interfere. He regularly 
came to the University, organized his 
notes, and dictated his memoirs. He 
kept himself busy. It was spectacular 
to see that he was gallant and noble 
even though he knew what he suffered 
from. Unfortunately, Kolodner was 
unable to finish his memoirs.
Courtesy University Publications 
Professor Emeritus Ignace Kolodner passed 
away at the age of 76.
Kolodner was married and di
vorced twice. Schaffer said, He 
had a very special relationship 
with his second wife, Dorothy. She 
was with him until the end. 
Kolodner is survived by his first 
wife, Ethel Kolodner and their two 
sons Richard and Paul, and by his 
second wife Dorothy Kolodner and 
their daughter Eva. Mizel said of 
him, He was a wonderful man. 
We knew what was going to hap
pen but it is still shocking for ev
eryone to cope with the fact that 
he is no longer here.
The Department of Mathematics 
will hold a memorial service for the 
late Professor Ignace Kolodner at 
3:30 pm., Thursday, April 18 in the 
Mellon Institute Auditorium.
4/14 ARMED ROBBERY,

When the victim rolled down 
the window, the suspect reached 
in with a four-inch knife and or
dered the victim out of the car. 
The suspect took the car keys and 
demanded the victims wallet. The 
car was not stolen. The victim

Student Senate tables activities fee increase
By TREVOR MEYEROWITZ
Tartan Staffwriter
Last Wednesday, Student 
Senate decided not to put a 
motion on the ballot to increase 
next years student activities 
fee by 30 percent.
A referendum to raise the fee 
did pass at the Senate meeting, 
but it was then withdrawn be
cause the senators felt that the 
issue hadnt been properly pub
licized and would probably be 
voted down by students.
The Student Senate is al
lowed to raise the activities fee 
by five dollars every year. A 
proposal to raise fees more than 
that must be passed by both 
Student Senate and by the 
Graduate Student Organiza
tion (GSO), and then it must 
pass a campus-wide vote.
Right now, graduate students
and undergraduates both pay a 
$100 activities fee. The GSO;felt 
that this money wasnt necessar
ily going to programs that gradu
ate students use. Many factors 
typically and legitimately lead 
graduate students to be less in
volved in campus life than under
graduates.... A system which 
charges undergraduates and 
graduates equally to fund extra
curricular activities is fundamen
tally flawed. It is unfair to both 
undergraduates and graduates, 
said Steven Vanni, a biology 
graduate student and biology rep
resentative to the GSO.
This issue will be raised again 
next year. Getting support wont 
be the hardest part. The hardest 
thing will be to get those support
ers to actually vote. Hopefully, 
Public Relations will do a better 
job next year to increase student 
involvement, said student Senator and freshman ECE major Mat
thew Phelps.
The fees have not been raised 
in at least five years, and then 
they were raised by 30 dollars, 
said Senate Chair Brenden 
Mielke, a sophomore industrial 
management major.
Another issue is what percent
age of the activities fee should go 
to GSO. Currently, 40 percent of 
the graduate students activities 
fees goes to the GSO, and the rest 
goes to the Student Senate. The 
argument is that graduate stu
dents have different needs than 
undergraduates, and that those 
needs arent being served by the 
portion of the activities fee that 
goes to Student Senate.
I think the fee split is good, 
because it facilitates activities and 
clubs in which the groups [gradu
ate and undergraduate students] 
can interact. Senate cannot make
graduate students take advantage 
of these opportunities, but they 
are free to, said Phelps.
Both sides agree there is a need 
to increase the spending on activi
ties for undergraduates. The situ
ation here is we have demand for 
activities with the quality and quan
tity of a 30,000 person campus, but 
with a 7,000 person base.... It has 
become imperative that we need 
more funding, [sic] said Mielke.
When asked whether the stu
dent activities fee needs to be 
raised, Vanni said, From the 
graduate perspective, no. From the 
undergraduate perspective, yes. 
This is why different fees should 
be charged.... The issue comes 
down to the question of what are 
reasonable roles for undergradu
ate and graduate students in cam
pus life. Our funding system should 
do more to recognize practical and 
desirable differences.

DATA
COMMUNICATIONS 
Disconnecting All 
Student Dorm 
Connections?
Effective May 20, 1996 All Current Network Connections 
For Students In On-Campus Housing Will Be Disconnected
Students can prevent a disruption in their networking services 
by preregistering their next data outlet activation. On April 22 
and 24,1996, between the hours of 9:00 and 4:30, in the lobby of 
the Student Center, Data Communications will have a staff 
member with a computer ready to assist students in completing 
network preregistrations for summer and fall data outlet 
activations. Preregistering your next network connection assures 
you that an outlet activation will be ready and waiting in your new 
room when you return to campus.

You need to know: v .
 The building and room you will be living in next
 The phone number in that room.
 What area in the room the outlet you want is located
 Information about your computer
If you cant make it April 22 and 24, there are two other ways to pre-register:
 You can use a WWW page to both obtain data outlet numbers and submit your 
preregistration electronically. The URL is:
http://www.net.cmu.edu/reg/student.html
 Or you can submit a paper PreRegistration form as found
in Cyert Hall 102. Only completed forms will be processed.
Preregistration is not mandatory, its just a good idea that can save students from 
waiting for an outlet activation during the busiest time of the year. DataComm received 
over 1200 activation requests last fall, sometimes at a rate of 300 per week. This can 
lead to a delay of up to two full weeks to process a network activation. Data 
Communications can keep that delay to a minimum by making connections the week 
before students arrive, and have an active outlet waiting for you if you preregister.
Starting the week of May 20, 1996 Data Communication will begin to activate summer 
preregistrations.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  15 April 1996
Original SEI director resigns after ten years
pmlKKiFe usEd o[.N M
close to the technology is tough 
to do.... explained Druffel. He 
also explained that he hoped 
Vice Provost for Research 
Duane Adams, who will head 
up a search committee 
to replace Druffel, will 
find someone who is 
more in touch with the 
technology.
Furthermore, having 
just recently renewed the 
SEIs government con
tract, Druffel felt that 
now was an opportune 
time, so that a new direc
tor would not have to re
negotiate right away.
On a lighter note,
Druffel also added that 
hed love to live in South 
Carolina.
Deputy Director Julia 
Allen was not surprised 
at Druffels decision to 
move. [It was] fairly evi
dent to me that he had 
achieved what he had 
come here to achieve, 
said Allen.
Despite the fact that 
President Mehrabian,
Provost Christiano, and
serves much of the credit for 
the extreme success of the SEI, 
he feels that his departure will 
in no way affect the SEI or its 
future.
If we do this right, the [soft
ware engineering industry] wont 
even notice, said Druffel, citing 
the five-year strategic plan in 
place at the SEI as the prime 
driving force.
Allen agrees, saying that it 
is realistic to expect 
that the SEI will not 
miss a beat. She cred
its the strong mission 
and Strategy for im
proving the practice, 
for the expected conti
nuity after Druffels 
departure.
[There are] enough 
people with the vision 
that it has built its own 
momentum, saidAllen.
Under Druffels lead
ership, the SEI has seen 
marked success as a 
pacemaker in the soft
ware engineeringindustry. According to a Blue 
Ribbon Panel appointed 
to review the SEI by the 
Advanced Research 
Project Administration 
(ARPA), The SEI has 
proven to be a leader in 
software engineering 
a discipline essentially 
non-existent ten yearsCourtesy of SEI
others feel Druffel de- Larry Druffel served as director of SEI for ten years, ago.... The SEI has accomplishedmore than any other 
government, industry, or aca
demic organization to improve 
software development....
In its ten-year existence, the 
SEI has influenced 12 of 20 
masters programs in software 
engineering nationally, and has 
developed the Computer Emer
gency Response Team (CERT) 
Coordination Center, deemed A 
SWAT Team in Cyberspace by 
a February 21, 1994 article in 
Newsweek.
Allen credits Druffel with 
many of the achievements of 
the SEI, saying he is a great 
strategist and visionary, and 
that he excels in working with 
other organizations.
He is definitely one of a kind 
in terms of his skills, saidAllen, 
citing that he can harmonize 
and combine differing views 
and skills to solve problems.
Allen will assume the role of 
SEIs director pn a temporary 
basis until the search commit
tee can find a replacement, a 
search which Druffel feels 
should take four to six months.
Larry [Druffel] has made a 
significant contribution, said 
a'heartfelt Allen, Im going to 
miss him.
Chairman emphasizes 
danger in cutting arts
drastic cuts that some have pr >- 
posed for the NEA With fewer 
dollars, well make fewer grants 
she explained. Over the past tv o
Tine usEd o[.N h
Pittsburgh. Marilyn Coleman, Ex
ecutive Director of ProArts said,
We were delighted to be able to 
sponsor[Alexandersvisit].We 
think its important people in 
Pittsburgh have an idea of 
whats going on with the En
dowment.
In the fiscal year ending
1995, the Endowment made
31 grants to Pittsburgh-based 
arts organizations, university 
arts programs, and artists, to
taling $859,710.
Director of Master of Arts 
Management Program Dan 
Martin demonstrated the 
ArtsNet Web site for 
Alexander. ArtsNet is a Web 
site created by graduate stu
dents in Arts Management JaneA,exander visited Heinzlcho^over a year ago as a resource 
by which others interested in 
Arts Management can gain ac
cess to other arts sites, data, or 
funding.
I felt it was a very successful 
event in terms of introducing the 
NEA to the technology were work
ing on, Martin said.
Alexander ended her lecture by 
emphasizing the danger in the
facilities last Friday.
years, the arts Endowment hs 
invested over one million dollars 
the cultural life of Pittsburgh. 0 vi >r 
the next two years, that number 
will surely decline, and if some 
Congress have their way, that num

FORUM
Carnegie Mellon University15 April 1996
! irStudents must
exercise right to vote
! Mickey Mouse or Marvin the 
Martian? Donald Duck or Darth 
Vader? Perhaps Buzz Lightyear. 
Many students are getting their 
joke candidate names ready  
it?s time for the Student Body 
President Elections.
; Elections are held during Car
nival, and as a member of the 
ptudent body, the elections will 
affect you whether you care or 
hot. Student apathy struck last 
year in a big way  only 462 
people voted. Those voters ac
counted for 6.5 percent of the 
Student population last year, a 
pathetic turn-out for any elec
tion.
Most students at CMU com
plain about conditions at the 
pniversity, but either think that 
change is not possible, or they 
just dont care enough to try. By 
not participating on elections, the 
student body insures that they 
can say that Student Govern
ment does not represent them, 
because it is not validated by the 
Student body. This is one side of 
k cycle that begins when stu
dents dont take the time to ex
cise their vote.
; ,During Carnival, you have the 
ability to exercise your voice .Vot
ing on your college representa
tives is a direct way that you can 
influence the presence of your 
College in Student Senate. As a 
Representative of the entire stu
dent body, the Student Body 
President has the potential to be 
tjhe most influential student in 
the determination of University 
policy.
| Your participation in govemment should continue after elec
tions are over as well. Once your 
senators have been elected, you 
need to communicate your views 
to them so they can effectively 
represent you. Communication 
is a two way street, some of the 
burden belongs to the student. If 
you have a gripe, tell someone 
other than your roommate, tell 
your Senator.
This weekend, you should feel 
compelled to go to the Midway, 
pass the booths, and vote for a 
candidate to be your president 
your premier representative to 
the administration and outside 
organizations. It only takes a 
minute, and you have a right and 
yes, a duty to do it. While youre 
at it, vote on the Senate candi
dates for your college.
If you neglect to do so, please 
realize that you forfeit your right 
to complain until the next elec
tion. Thats right. A CMU stu
dent who doesnot vote for aPresident, Treasurer, or Senator, has 
no right to complain about the 
situations on campus  these 
officials are your quickest venue 
to change, and believe it or not, 
they want to help.
So, take a few moments to lis
ten to the broadcast of the Presi
dential Debate (WRCT 88.3 FM, 
Thursday at 4 pm), read the 
Presidents platforms, and de
velop an informed opinion. The 
voting booth will be located on 
the Midway next to the APhiO 
concessions booth. The polls will 
be open Thursday from 7 to 11 
pm, 6 to 11 pm on Friday, and 5 
to 7 pm on Saturday.
Campus grounds need 
year-round care
j It is spring at Carnegie Mellon. 
F6r most, the budding of the 
trees, the smell of flowers, and 
sjprouting grass are telltale signs 
mat winter is departing. At CMU 
fyowever, spring brings with it 
the malodorous scent of fertil
iser in the air. Campus 
ijebeautification is now in full 
force, as the campus prepares for 
Carnival and Commencement.
| Members of the campus commtinity need to dodge the varied 
pots of wet concrete being used 
to fix badly cracked and even 
otholed sidewalks. Portions of 
the campus grounds are unat
tractively roped off to promote 
tihe reseeding effort. Recently, 
with fertilizing to no avail, sod 
has been placed to speed up the 
process.
Why must so much effort be 
I laced at this time every year to 
beautify the campus? Perhaps 
nore aggressive year-round att sntion to the upkeep of the cam
pus would spread out the de
mands on Facilities Management 
Services, charged with the beau
tification. Reseeding one month 
before Commencement ceremo
nies (forget a week before Carni
val) surely does not leave enough 
tj.me for the growth of new grass. 
Tj'his is especially true with 
Pittsburghs highly unpredict
able spring weather.

throughout the year. The first

houses for welfare recipients. In his ar
ticle, he complains that he, and the rest 
of us hard-working, struggling students, 
are the equivalent of a cow being fat
tened for slaughter, mourning the fact 
that the people who struggle get their 
hard-earned money taken from them to 
be given to any stray beggar who is 
incapable of rousing himself to any ef
fort. Appearing to have no fear of gener
alizing, he describes welfare recipients 
as a whole as those who dont try and 
dont even have to think. This assump
tion in itself is unforgivable and inaccu
rate.
Orris fears that welfare creates people 
who feel that they only have to demand 
and someone will provide. The reason
most people are on welfare is that they 
struggled and demanded, and no one 
provided. As for his conception that wel
fare devastates people and causes pov
erty, it is the fact that we do not provide 
people with enough money to live that 
they remain in poverty; and if they do 
get a minimum-wage job, their support 
will be cut off. Yes, the welfare system is 
presently a gross sham, because some 
of us think a mother and three children 
can live off of about $370 dollars a month 
($4440 a year), and others of us think 
that this is too much.
The welfare system is a gross sham 
because some of us think that it is too 
much for a family to be given a chance to 
live in a home instead of being herded 
into high rises like animals. The sham is 
that neither welfare nor minimum-wage 
jobs pay enough to live. (Ah, yes, mini
mum-wage: receiving about $600 a 
month after taxes, or $7200 a year  
assuming you never get sick  you too 
can live grossly under the poverty level.) 
If anything, welfare breeds crime and 
poverty because it does not provide 
enough money to survive, and teaches
the people that they do not deserve more.
A single person making $30,000 a year 
will pay $5,372 in federal taxes for 1995. 
Seeing that about one percent of the 
federal budget goes to welfare programs 
such as these, this would mean a total of 
$53.72, or .017 percent of his or her 
income this year. So much for a few 
thousand here and a few thousand 
there. So many individuals seem so 
concerned about the meager amount of 
money spent on welfare for those who 
have no money, but nobodys writing 
about the billion of dollars in tax breaks 
given to wealthy corporations. Ask me 
about why Im going to make 80 cents for 
Orriss every dollar, and Ill tell you 
about feeling like a cow being fattened 
for slaughter.
Orris would be a much happier person 
if he stopped thinking of the huge sac
rifices he is forced to make and started 
appreciating the opportunities he has 
had. i>

impression of any campus for its 
visitors is a visual one. Though 
there is little we can do to ensure 
sunny days with blue skies, we 
can and should do everything we 
can to make a good impression. 
This entails plush green grass 
and well maintained walkways. 
The grassy cut and mall areas 
are also recreational areas for 
the University Community, as 
demonstrated by the number of 
people seen playing volleyball 
and frisbee when the weather is 
nice. While there are more 
alumni, parent, and future stu
dent visitors to the campus in 
the latter half of the spring se
mester, an attractive campus 
lends to greater campus pride 
from the students, faculty, and 
staff, who live and work here 
year-round.
Granted, some of the mud on 
the cut can be attributed to the 
ongoing construction of the Uni
versity Center. However, other 
eyesores to the campus are preventable. The grass alongside 
most of the campus walkways is 
missing in large part because of 
the Mules that often stray off the 
walkways.
There are many forms of cam
pus pride. Lets be proud of how 
our campus looks. Perhaps the 
myth that CMU is not a nice 
place to be can be dispelled if the 
physical details of the campus 
did not perpetuate it so well.

Nothing illustrates this point better than the issue of fetus is partially removed from the womb, dismembered,
abortion.
The Republican 
party platform advo
cates repealing Roe 
vs. Wade and enact
ing a complete ban 
on abortion.
The supporters of 
such a ban believe 
that human rights 
begin at the moment 
of conception. At this 
moment, the woman
who is carrying the fetus becomes a secondary concern. 
The fetuss rights become an unquestionable primary to 
which hers must be sacrificed. Only in the case of rape or 
danger to her life is there any exception, and many in the 
Pro-Life movement dislike granting even this exception.
The justification for forbidding abortion, despite any

this is an unpleasant 
thought, but consider that 
this procedure is used in 
less than one percent of all 
abortions performed in this 
country. It is only per

rious medical circum
stances that warrant it,

was at risk, and it was determined that no other medical 
procedure would suffice.
Otherwise, the doctor who performed the abortion would

this point, it is impossible to argue any further.
The means by which one engages in rational argument 
of some issue is reason, and the reference of truth for both 
parties is reality. The anti-abortion position moves the 
debate out of the realm of reason by basing its premises on 
mystical revelation.
There is no rational justification for forbidding abortion. 
The argument that life begins at conception, therefore it 
must be protected is false. Those who advance this argu
ment are ignoring the biological nature of the fetus, blur
ring the distinction between the potential and the actual, 
and ignoring the nature and source of rights.
Yes, as soon as an ovum is fertilized, it has the potential
Consider what this means. A physician, acting to the best 
ofhis rational ability, determines that a patient desperately 
needs a medical procedure, otherwise her health will be 
severely damaged.
He is forbidden to act on his judgment, with no argument 
given to him as to why but a Bible and a gun pointed at his 
head. Even if it is the womans life that is at stake, he must 
later justify his decision to possibly skeptical and unsympa-. 
thetic prosecutors.
The immorality of this is unspeakable, but what it does to 
the woman is worse. It says, in effect, that she has no right 
to her own life; that it is her duty to sacrifice her health.
This means a living, thinking, conscious human being is
to become a human life. That is all it is: a potential. This to be endangered for the sake of a potential. That these
potential is not realized until birth.
Until that time, thefetus is entirely dependent upon and 
part of its mothers body. It has no separate identity of its 
own.
It is for this reason that the fetus has no rights. Rights 
pertain to living, thinking, individual human beings, not 
to something that has only a potential to be human and is 
still part of another persons body.
The right to decide whether to carry the pregnancy to 
term is solely that of the woman carrying the fetus. It is her 
body.
It is to this potential, however, that anti-abortionists 
want to sacrifice the rights of a living human being.
This illustrates clearly the abhorrent nature of altru
ism, the doctrine that man has no right to exist for himself, 
that he must sacrifice for the sake of others, and that some 
men have the right to dictate the personal decisions of 
others.
In this case, it is not even sacrifice of one man to another, 
but sacrifice for the sake of sacrifice.
Those who wish to end abortion have been unremitting sible replies to his column.
specimens of depravity who advocate this view label them
selves Pro-Life is an obscenity.
This obscenity is even worse considering their opposition 
to abortion includes the vast majority of abortions which are 
performed during the first trimester, when the fetus is little 
more than a blob of cells.
Since they believe that life begins at conception, this 
includes such procedures as the morning after pill, that 
would destroy the fetus when it is only a day old, and 
consists of at most a few hundred cells.
This is so ridiculous that I have difficulty imagining that 
there are human beings, with perfectly normal brains, who 
are capable of the level of evasion necessary to uphold such 
a view, that they would actually be willing to sacrifice 
someone over this.
Sadly, they do exist and have great political power. They 
must be opposed at every opportunity lest they succeed in 
their quest.

Appropriation of slurs furthers tradition of bigotry
stota pYumOeYO
Todays lesson is about moral 
hypocrisy, moral hypocrisy in the 
form of word reappropriation. 
What is word reappropriation, 
you ask? Well, its the practice of 
using derogatory phrases geared 
against your clique or group to
wards members of your specific 
clique or group. Let me illustrate 
this with some examples.
An example of reappropriation 
can be seen in the recent hit film 
Pulp Fiction, where black people 
refer to other black people as 
"nigger.
Another example would be a 
homosexual calling another ho
mosexual faggot, or an even 
more colorful term. Using these 
previously 
deemed offensive
terms is consid- Today's

word reappropriation.
cliques, but only nnl 
when it comes 
from within. If an outsider used 
any of these terms, why, heavens 
be! The next term to be used would 
be lawsuit.
An example of an extreme case 
of this would be where a CDROM encyclopedia company was 
sued because a black man found 
references to the word nigger in 
the form of an entry about the
This is a double standard of the 
highest degree. Either the term 
is demeaning or it is not, regard
less ofits source. Are these people 
willfully accepting the detrimen
tal undertones ofthese slurs? One 
of the first ways to fight prejudice 
is to resist nihilistic forces from 
within and assert yourself as bet
ter than what the prejudice makes
you out to be (this idea, by the way, 
I picked up from Cornell West). 
Accepting and even adopting de
vices of the biased perpetrators is 
an abdicationin the 
battle against igno
rance.
It would be a dif
ferent case if 
groups did not re
act to any use of 
enuuus verbal slurs, from 
within or without. 
This would thwart the stupidity of 
bigotry. But the process of 
reappropriating terms suggests 
weakness. It admits exactly what 
sexists and racists and bigots would 
have everyone believe  the faults 
that they claim certain groups to 
have. Slurring members of your 
own group would be akin to saying, 
Theyre right, were wrong, but
who cares? Life goes on. Pass 
the salt.
Maybe Im reading into things 
a little, but I think this issue 
does have some meat on its 
bone when Person A can cause 
a moral uprising and Person B 
can be treated just like one of 
the gang all because of what 
they say. Prejudice is still preju
dice even though it might come 
from someone who shares the 
same beliefs, etc., with you. 
Prejudice is an awful thing, and 
bigots are awful people. Their 
claims and viewpoints are weak 
and biased and can easily be 
defeated. Reappropriation is 
the first step in the wrong di
rection.

Technological advances fail to embrace humanity
sYCrnxe dYht
Ahhh, spring is here. Of course, were 
in Pittsburgh, which inevitably means 
that by time of publication the weather 
will be back to 20-below and Ill have to be 
scraping ice off my car. But as of right 
now, Im enjoying myself, reading out
side, and smelling the wondrous odors of 
whatever dead, funky frozen thing is 
thawing out from the depths of winter. 
The joys of rebirth. I was walking with a 
friend and she said, with a smile, It 
smells like baseball. I immediately 
thought of drug-abusive, overweight, testicle-scratching, tobacco-chewing, wom
anizing sods who get paid unfathomable 
amounts of money to play a childs game 
for a bunch of drunk yuppies who are too 
lazy to do it themselves, but I went along 
iwith it anyway and agreed. I caught her 
drift.
This spring means something new to 
me, as well, because I just turned the 
magical age of 21. The age of knowledge, 
wisdom, adulthood, and legalized abuse 
of alcohol. I know that if the knowledge 
and wisdom dont show up, at least I have 
my Budweiser. I worry sometimes if I 
have an addictive personality, but an
other close friend told me, while I drunk 
myself into a stupor, that its alright 
because alcoholism can be a hobby until 
Im 26. What a relief. Its a shame, though, 
thatalcohol isnt a taboo thing anymore. 
I can walk into any bar or liquor store in
the country and use my real ID now. 
Wheres the fun in that? Now all I have to 
amuse me is drug use, the importation of 
Cuban chickens, and child prostitution. 
Whoever said getting older isnt fun was 
damn right. But Ill cope.
Its quite depressing that Im actually 
sitting here in a computer lab, but gosh 
dam it, I have a responsibility to you 
three readers out there. I cant say I have 
anything new or interesting to say. My 
brain shuts down when weather like this 
shows up, and Im pretty sure thats the 
way God intended it to be. He gives us nice 
weather so we can enjoy ourselves, frolic, 
and play, and when he makes it pour hail 
stones the size of small children, thats 
the time to be contemplative. This room 
really gives me a bogus feeling. I look 
around and wonder about all these mind
less zombies who stare at their only friend, 
Mr. Mac PC with 540 megabyte RMV, 
PCP Super . Hard drive capacity, with 
modem and CD-ROM, and a toaster oven 
for those long, hard nights. They pour out 
their lonely souls to a Conference Room 
of people all over the globe as they mas
turbate to a dirty picture of a mail-order 
bride from Hong Kong. No one talks; they 
just sit in a daze, dreaming of the day they 
can hook up their entire body to this 
monster machine and receive what the 
rest of us are attempting to face every day 
 life.
Computers are the death of us all. With 
every possible good thing it might supply, 
it has another hundred evils that it in
fests our society with. If I could go to a 
mainframe center and destroy the control 
system thats pumping out all this filth, I 
would with no hesitation, but whats even
scarier is that there isnt one. Weve cre
ated a beast that cant be stopped unless 
they are all demolished. Let me tell you 
what I can do on computers. I can go to 
Microsoft Word and I type these articles. 
Every so often, I can write a friend from 
home on email. Thats it. I conveniently 
forgot what crap they taught me in CSW 
because I knew, even back then, that it was 
more trouble than anything else. This ma
chine is a glorified typewriter, and thats 
all it should be. Helpful, but not vital.
I seriously doubt anyone could convince 
me that computers have incredibly en
hanced our existence on this planet, and if 
they tried, Id laugh, and let them know 
that if thats what they believe life is, 
theyre on the wrong path. TV is bad enough. 
I should know. My main baby-sitter as 
child was the Boob Tube and I was hooked. 
But now that I look back, I get somewhat 
frightened about what they were pumping 
into my system. For example, what was 
network television attempting to tell me 
withDiff rent Strokes, Webster, an d Benson1? 
I loved these shows. I thought they were so 
funny. But then I saw Good Times and 
Whats Happening? and figured out how 
the execs were attempting to brainwash 
me. Heres what they did. They all got 
around the big oak table and said, Well 
gee willikers guys, the NAACP is on our 
ass for not putting more black people on 
our networks, what should we do? And the 
big head network dude said, Thats no 
problem. Well just make a bunch of shows 
about cute little black children who have to. 
go live with white folks for a proper up
bringing. And there you go. They didnt 
want to offend us white folk, so they picked 
two cute kids, Gary Coleman and
Emmanuel Lewis, and stuck them in white 
homes so they could live a better life. 
Seriously, when have you ever seen two 
little kids who didnt get any taller than 
four-foot-three in your lifetime except those 
two? They must have had a network breed
ing farm for unintimidating AfricanAmericans. And Benson, he was the coolest 
guy in the governors mansion, as well as 
the smartest, and even though he was the 
governors aide, he worked in the kitchen 
with Krauss the cook. Whats up with 
that? It took four seasons for him to get his 
own office, and thats only because the 
short, fat bald guy left.
And if TV can do all that to a developing 
child, what do you think computers are 
going to do? My best friends little sister is 
addicted. She knows more about the web, 
the Internet, America Online, and Lord 
knows what else than me and my friend 
combined, and shes only six. She gets 
more email a week than Ive ever gotten.
Weve been on this planet for centuries 
and made it this far without this Satanic 
device: Its still not too late to go back.
Who know? As wrong as blowing up 
bombs and people is, in many ways, Mr. 
Unabomers got some good points. Go out. 
Interact. Play. Sing. Dance. Breathe the 
air and watch a sunset.
The best show on Earth isnt on a screen,

Headphones, Weird Ai make unique fashion statements
fYV dxoPto
When I went home for Spring 
Break, one of my top priorities 
was getting a set of headphones. 
My Weird AI Yankovic tapes 
were sitting on an old black table 
in our garage because my par
ents only listen to country. After 
rescuing them from the dust and 
grime and seeing that my new 
headphones play the tapes a little
bit faster than normal, I have 
incorporated the headphones as 
part of my everyday style.
From the looks of things, a lot 
of people are fascinated that the 
nerdy guy who wears the big black 
hat everywhere now has head
phones, especially since the metal 
ring wont fit under my hat and I 
have to put it in back of my head.
Also, I have noticed that most 
peoples attitudes toward people 
with headphones change some
what. If theres even a hint of 
foam padding around the ears or 
wire running up to someones
head, the person gets regarded 
with a kind of mock civility that 
almost belies the feeling within 
to just yank those headphones off 
his or her head and stick them 
where the sun dont shine.
Even when Im not playing my 
tapes, I have a tendency to listen 
to The Revolution, 104.7 FM. 
This is especially frightening to 
me since I can now actually un
derstand most song lyrics. Just a 
few years ago I wouldnt have 
even dreamed of wearing head
phones and listening to modern 
rock. I could not understand the
lyrics unless I was reading the 
little insert that came with the 
album.
However, if I hear Shes 
Lump! one more time Im going 
to have to vent some frustrations 
on various glass objects.
Whether Im listening to 
Soundgarden, The Presidents of 
the United States of America, or 
Weird Al, of course, it sure helps 
to pass the time while Im doing 
work in the clusters. And it helps 
distract me from the monotony of 
hearing the keyboard click over 
and over and over again.
What never ceases to amaze 
me is that some headphone wear
ers have their music so loud that 
I can hear it through their head
phones. Mine can be so loud that 
they rival a C-l 30 taking off. The 
makers of Miracle Ear may have 
a few prospective clients here in a 
few years, especially listeners of 
death metal, which can only be 
truly appreciated beyond the 
threshold of pain.

Baseball returns as national pastime
The Suicide Squeeze
by Anuj Gupta
Every baseball season seems to 
have some sort of nickname at
tached to it by the middle of the 
season. For example, 1987 was 
the year of the longball, 1994 
was the year of the strike, and 
though it has never been called 
this officially, I am prone to nam
ing 1995 as the year of disillu
sionment. Fortunately for base
ball fans, many of the reasons for 
negative connotations have 
passed by and once again the 
fans can concentrate on the ac
tion on the field as opposed to off. 
As a result, I have dedicated this 
weeks column to starting a trend 
for 1996 which will now be en
titled the year of the comeback, 
for not only is it a comeback year 
for players such as Sandberg and 
Dwight Gooden, but it is also a 
year for the game to make a come
back as well.
In the National League, there 
j is not a bigger comeback story 
than that from Chicagos north 
side. The return of Ryne Sandberg 
has been heralded as the next 
! best thing since Jordans return.
| Though he may be a step slower 
| and his bat may be less potent, he 
| is still better than most second 
! basemen in baseball. In the long 
j term, his return will benefit the 
| Cubs organization both on and 
off the field as he will also draw a 
I few extra fans around the league.
1 Dont mind his slow start either.
! Though he is only hitting .150 to 
! start the year, Sandberg is a pe
rennially slow starter, and as 
' evidenced by his performance in 
it spring training, his game will pick 
up.
A comeback story does not nec
essarily mean that one has to 
retire first and then pull a Sugar 
Ray. Instead, merely coming 
back after a year full of injuries or
generally bad performances can 
constitute a good comeback story. 
The National League just hap
pens to be full of these types of 
stories this year, and Pittsburgh 
is the best case of these. I have 
always taken a licking for talking 
up Paul Wagner, and finally I 
have reached a position in which 
I can say, I told you so. Wagner 
has always had excellent stuff, 
but never really knew what to do 
with it. As a result, he was con
stantly falling behind hitters and 
then getting pounded when he 
was forced to throw a fastball 
over the plate for a strike. Magi
cally, this year Wagner has 
learned that it is not only neces
sary, but okay to pitch inside, 
and as a result he can use his 
nasty slider and 90 mph plus 
fastball to get groundball 
outs. Already he is 20 and 
has pitched 16 consecutive 
scoreless innings. Though 
he may not win a Cy 
Young award, look for 
a consistent perfor
mance from him 
throughout the year.
A few other cases 
worth mentioning in
clude Lenny Dykstra 
and Terry Mullholand of 
the Phillies and Chris 
Sabo of the Reds. Dykstra 
is finally healthy again 
and Mullholand is re
united with pitching 
coach Johnny Podres 
whose instruction 
style led Mullholand to 
become one of the NLs most 
consistent pitchers from 1989- 
1993. Sabo is healthy as well and 
is back where he loves to play 
most. Dont expect 30 home runs, 
but look for steady play at third 
base and possibly in the outfield.
The American League is not 
without its share of comeback 
stories either. Without question, 
the biggest of the year is the re
turn of Dwight Gooden to base
ball. Gooden, once baseballs most 
dominating pitcher, was on a 
downhill slide since 1988 when 
the Mets last won the division. A 
variety of problems from injuries 
to drug abuse led to his ban from
baseball in 1995. He has been 
reinstated though, and the Yan
kees have decided to take a chance 
on him. His fastball is once again 
in the 90s and he has added a few 
off-speed pitches to his repertoire. 
Though it may take him a month 
or two to find his rhythm again, 
the Yankees have themselves a 
bargain and any rtisserie owner 
would be wise to pick him up 
while they still can.
There are of course other good 
comeback stories in the Ameri
can League. The names of Paul 
Molitor, Kevin Mitchell, Frank 
Viola, and Jimmy Key 
allfitintothis 
category.
been taken already, though. 
Something so small as teams 
starting games at 7:05 instead of 
7:35 while school is in session can 
make all the difference in the 
world, for it can allow an entire 
generation of young fans to fol
low a game that their parents 
did. Of course, larger measures 
such as the establishment of a 
new television contract dont hurt 
either. Instead of the Friday and 
Saturday night broadcasts on The 
Baseball Network, Major League 
Baseball in conjunction with FOX 
has decided to re
turn to the traBut the biggest 
comeback at
tempt of the year 
is one which crosses the bound
aries of leagues. It is one which 
transcends the game as a whole 
and American society as well. The 
comeback which I am referring to 
is the comeback of baseball. After 
seeing attendance drop nearly 25 
percent last year as a result of the 
strike, baseball has a long way to 
go before it can reclaim its title as 
the National Pastime.
Players can sign all the auto
graphs they want, but until some 
stability is established in the 
sport, there will be a long road 
ahead. Significant steps have
ditional Sat
urday after
noon game of 
the week. 
Personally, I 
have many good 
memories of growing 
up and watching those 
games on a hot weekend 
afternoon in the summer, 
and I believe that many 
others will once again be 
able to share in those plea
sures.
Nevertheless, actions such as 
the recent refusal by Indians slug
ger Albert Belle to sign a five 
year, $38 million contract, stifle 
any progress which has been 
made. Events like this only re
inforce the bad taste which has 
been left in fans mouths by last 
seasons strike.
It is time that players and 
owners alike realize that with
out the fans, most of them would 
be bagging groceries, and should 
they continue to squabble 
among themselves, the come
back will fall short. Didnt I 
see some help wanted signs at 
Giant Eagle anyway?

NHL playoffs make 
for poor predicting
From the Point
by Jason Andracki
As usual, the NHL playoff 
race is going down to the wire. 
One game will decide if you 
play for the Stanley Cup or start 
trying to correct your slice. This 
tight competition for the last 
playoff spots may make for ex
citing hockey, but it means 
nothing but trouble when youre 
trying to preview the playoffs.
Im not as confident about my 
mid-season pick of the Penguins 
and Avalanche in the finals 
with the Pens reclaiming the 
Cup. Oddly enough, its the 
Penguins that Im doubting and 
not the Avalanche. Everybody 
is picking the Red Wings to win 
without a doubt (the latest odds 
from Las Vegas are 6-5) but 
Im sticking by the Avalanche.
On the other hand, I dont 
feel the same about Pittsburgh. 
Two factors determine my out
look for my hometown favorite.
First, without Tomas 
Sandstrom back in the lineup, 
they wont make it out of the 
first round. He is listed day-today, so there still is a chance 
hell return during the first 
round. Sandstrom may not 
seem important with Lemieux 
and Jagr, but in the playoffs, 
the superstars will be shad
owed heavily, so it will be up to 
Sandstrom along with Ron 
Francis and Petr Nedved to pick 
up the slack.
The second factor is with 
whom the Pens will match up 
against. I have no doubt they 
will trounce the Bruins to claim 
the conference title, but the 
Tampa Bay/New Jersey situa
tion was only just decided. Im
predicting the winner of this 
series will be the Eastern Con
ference representative in the 
finals. As much as I love Petr 
Klima and Darren Puppa, I 
dont think the Lightning will 
clear the first round if they 
even make the playoffs. If this 
is the matchup, the Pens will 
do it in five.
On the other hand, if the Dev
ils get their chance to defend 
the Cup, the Penguins wont 
have a chance to reclaim the' 
glory of the early 1990s. If the' 
Devils make it, I say theyll 
repeat or at least make it to the1 
conference finals, which I pick' 
to be a rematch against the' 
Flyers. Watch for rugged' 
winger Bill Guerin to pick up 
the slack from last years Conn' 
Smythe winner Claude 
Lemieuxs departure.
In the Western Conference, I 
have no doubt that the Avalanche will survive until the 
finals in their first year of exist
ence. Their only challenge will 
be the Red Wings, which will be  
a goaltenders battle.
Although he might not have 
shown it this year, Patrick 
Roy is still the better 
goaltender when matched up 
against Mike Vernon or Chris 
Osgood. If I were drafting a 
playoff squad, Roy and Claude 
Lemieux would be my top two 
choices (with Peter Forsberg 
also being on the list) since 
they can carry the Avalanche
 or almost any team  to 
the finals.
My picks for the final round 
are either the Penguins and 
Avalanche or Devils and Ava
lanche. Ill pick the Devils in 
four or the Penguins in seven.
Jason Andracki is a junior 
professional writing major. If 
he was a betting man, hed put 
some money on the Devils 
whose odds are 25-1. He fig
ures $300 or so would pay off

English Premiership race heats up
International Sports News
by Rahul Aggarwal
Soccer
What was black and white and now red all over? 
The Premiership Trophy. Well, not quite, but it is 
looking decidedly that way. Newcastle United have 
squandered their once unassailable lead and are 
now trailing behind Manchester United. Newcastle, 
who has been leading throughout virtually all of 
the season, is faltering in the final straight.
With Kevin Keegans acquisition of Columbian 
Faustino Asprilla, and Blackburns David Batty, 
one would have thought that Newcastle would 
have won the Premiership streets ahead of the 
chasers, but Asprillas inclusion in the squad has 
seen a winning team become a losing one in recent 
weeks. Asprilla is without a doubt one of the 
most gifted players on earth, but he has maybe 
taken a little longer than anticipated to blend 
into the team.
Keegan has virtually been handed a blank check 
by Chairman Sir John Hall, and Keegan has bought 
wisely  in most cases turning potential into 
reality. However, his desire to build a glamour 
team may have adversely affected Newcastlefor 
the moment at least.
Manchester United manager, Alex Ferguson, on 
the other hand, has nurtured his young talent well 
and guided them into the first team. Now they are 
rewarding him for his faith. Reformed Frenchman 
Eric Cantona has been instrumental in Manches
ter Uniteds recovery.
He has virtually single-handedly put them on 
'top again by clinching late goals and has inspired 
the rest of the team to perform. Newcastle is 
currently six points behind Man Utd with a game 
[in hand.
Newcastle continues to play their flowing cavalier-style soccer and were involved in what was 
called the match of the season against Liverpool
at AnfLeld. Having fallen behind in only the second 
minute of the game, Newcastle fought back to lead 
21, only to see it equalized.
They led again through Asprilla and Liverpool 
responded swiftly. Geordie hearts were dealt a 
cruel blow when Stan Collymore scored for Liverpool 
in injury time. Newcastle has a bad habit of squan
dering leads in the closing stages of matches, as 
was shown again against Blackburn, when they 
conceded two goals in the last four minutes to lose
2-1. Man Utd, however, have been cool, calm, and 
collected under pressure and have taken all their 
chances. That is why they are where they are.
Personally, I feel England would benefit from 
having Newcastle represent them in the 
Champions League. They have to be more wary in 
defense though, if they are not to crumble on 
foreign soil like most British teams in the past. It 
will be a tough call to say who will win the 
Premiership. Right now Man Utd are in the driving 
seat and have the easier run-in. Newcastle must 
win all their remaining games to keep the pressure 
on Man Utd. Being a Newcastle supporter, I would 
be heart-broken to see anyone other than the men 
on Tyneside lift the Trophy.
Cricket
Pakistan clinched the three-nation Singer Cup 
in Singapore, when it defeated Sri Lanka in the 
final. In an earlier game between the two sides, 
Sanath Jayasuriya wrote himself into the record 
books for his breath-taking century off a mere 48 
balls  the fastest ever ODI century. This innings 
included 11 sixes (another world record).
In the final, he hit the fastest ODI 50from only 
17 balls! He has been talked of in the same air as 
Sir Donald Bradman and Vivian Richards, to name 
a few. Its no surprise.
The Sharjah Cup has just got underway. India, 
Pakistan, and South Africa are taking part in the 
tournament. In the opening game, Pakistan beat 
India by 38 runs with Aamir Sohail scoring 105 out 
of Pakistans total of 271/5. In reply, India slumped 
to 95/5, before a sterling 116-run partnership be
tween Sanjay Manjrekar and Nayan Mongia 
brought India back into the game.
However, with Manjrekars dismissal for 59, 
the rest of the Indian batting caved in, with only 
Mongia offering any real resistance. He topscored with 69. The winner will be decided on 
April 20th.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  15 April 199613Speedskating club proves worthy contender
fnaie usEd o[.N h]
take it easy and skate my best. Appar
ently his strategy worked, since Moran 
ended up winning seven of his eight 
races, placing first in his division.
Individually, the team members did 
well also. Soultanian earned a spot at 
Nationals on March 1417, and fared 
well. My competition was tough. The 
ice was really fast and well kept, and I 
did set personal records. Going to Na
tionals was the first time that I saw 
Olympic quality skaters, said 
Soultanian.
: Going to Nationals was quite an ac
complishment, as this was only 
Soultanians second year skating com
petitively.
Losing two members of their team, 
the speedskating club encourages any
one who has an interest in competitive 
skating to come out and join the team, 
even if just to observe.
The team has a tough training regifnen put together by the team and their 
coach, Dr. Wade Smith, who just placed
second in his National appearance. They 
have ice times six times a week, practic
ing at Neville Ice Arena iii the South 
Side and Schenley Ice Rink, and also 
train in the gym.
But according to Moran, this 
shouldnt scare away anyone who 
hasnt skated before. New members 
are always welcome. They dont even 
need to have previous experience on 
the ice. There are many people to 
coach both formally and informally, 
so there is never a lack of advice, said 
Moran.
The sport stresses overall cardio
vascular and physical fitness and 
athleticism, as well as coordination. 
Although the sport is very technical 
in terms of correct body position and 
movement, it is not difficult to learn, 
said Soultanian.
Anyone interested in becoming a 
member of the speedskating club 
should contact Soultanian at 621- 
6576.

Its time for the players who have 
worked hard to get some recogni
tion. Heres to giving credit where 
predit is due.
Defensive player of the year 
(small): Mookie Blaylock  
Blaylock is second in the league 
in steals (2.6/game) without foulrng a lot (1.9/game).
Defensive player of the year 
(big): David RobinsonHiscompination of steals (1.4/game), 
$wats shoots (3.4 blocks/game), 
&nd boards (8.3 defensive re
bounds/game) is unparalleled.
Most Underrated Player 
(tie): Eddie Jones and Elden 
'Campbell  playing in the shad
ows of the much hyped Nick Van 
Exel, Cedric Ceballos, and Magic 
[Johnson, Jones and Campbell 
provide stability. Campbells 
points (13.6/game) and rebounds 
'(7.7/game) are fine, but his de
fense (1.1 steals/game, 2.6blocks/ 
jgame) makes the difference. 
Jones makes few mistakes and 
fills in wherever the team is lack
ing.
Most Improved Player:
Gheorghe Muresan  Muresan 
led the league in field goal per
centage (58.3%). Points and re
bounds per game soared this sea
son (14.7 and 9.7 respectively).
; Sixth Man of the year: Toni 
Kukoc  Kukoc would start for 
'any other team. He is the sup
pressed superstar.
Rookie of the year: Joe Smith 
r Call him Mr. Consistency. 
Strength, savvy, and shooting 
touch are rare in a 20-year-old 
pokie. Who could ask for more?
; Most Likely to Succeed: 
Kevin Garnett  Points (10.2/ 
feame), rebounds (6.1/game), and 
assists (1.7/game) are relatively 
low, but he broke into the start
ing lineup late in the season. He 
is most likely an all-star next 
season.
; Best Old Guy Still Playing:
pharles Barkley  After 10 sea
sons, he is still cranking out the 
lumbers (23.3 ppg, 11.6rpg, 3.7 
apg), and looks older than he is.
Most overdue for an award:

The 1996 Intramural Floor Hocf^ 
championships were held in This|)e, 
Hall on Thursday, April 11. Chants; 
were crowned in four different leagues,, 
The first game of the night was in thg: 
womens-only league. The Pioneers 
faced off against the Wet Leather Con
gresswomen. The Pioneers grabbed an 
early lead by scoring three first-period 
goals while shutting out WLC. In the 
second period, WLC narrowed the gap 
with an early goal but that proved to  
all that they could manage agains^pj 
tough Pioneers defense. Pioneers went 
on to score three more goals and cap
ture the title by a final of 6-1. Pioneers 
finished at 5-1 and WLC ended at 4-1-1.
Next on the slate was a matchup,qf, 
two divisional foes with Pestilence tak
ing on the 69ers. The earlier garjie 
between these two ended in a tie, so a 
close game was expected. Pestilence 
scored 37 seconds into the game, but 
it would prove to be the only lead they 
would enjoy. The 69ers would tally two 
goals to take the lead at the end of one 
period. The first eight minutes of the 
second period put the 69ers in copjt, 
mand with a 5-1 lead. At the end oftw,, 
periods, the score stood at 6-2. Tije, 
offensive skill of Jim Buck and Chris, 
Adukaitis, and the defensive play of Jay;, 
Blanco dominated the third period, giv
ing the 69ers the championship by a'' 
final score of 12-2. 69ers finished the' 
season at 7-0-1 and Pestilence at6-4-li '
The third game matched SAE Chrhy 
pions and Back Alley in the non-chedRingfinal. Inthisgame, BackAlleyjumped 
out to a 2-0 lead with a first period goal 
and an early second period tally. SAE 
scored once to bring the score to 2-1 
after two periods. SAE would score 
three early goals in the third period ahcf 
it looked like they would take the crown ,' 
but Back Alley had other ideas. Bac 
Alley scored two goals in the late golrig. 
and tied the game at 4-4. With les 
than 30 seconds left, Back Alley scorefj, 
to win the inaugural championship.lH 
the non-checking league. Back Alley 
ended at a perfect 6-0, and SAE fin
ished at 4-2.
The final game of the evening pitted 
Beta Primelake and Grand Finale. The 
first period was scoreless until Frank. 
Triggiani of Beta scored to take a 1-$ 
lead with 22 seconds left in the peripctf 
Grand Finale answered quickly at th. 
start of the second period to tie th 
game. GF then scored twice in tjftfe 
remaining time of the period to take^a
3-1 lead at the end of two. Beta scored 
at 4:53 and 8:41 to tie the game at &
3. Then, with a little over a minute 
remaining, Wayne Scholar of Beta 
scored off a scramble in front of the 
goal to win the game. Beta finished the 
season at4-0-1 and Grand finalefinish^cl 
at 2-2-1.
The Intramural departmentwould Ji$ 
to thank the officials and teams, antj 
would also like to thank Tom Sullivan 
for his many years of help to the fiar 
hockey program.

?J^he tennis .teams continue their 
preparation for the UAA Champion
ships this week to be held at the Uni
versity of Rochester. Both teams were 
atjQettysburg this past weekend; the 
mgris team played a second match 
against Lebanon Valley. The womens 
tegm also played against Allegheny 
College last Monday.
[Che mens team had an excellent 
weekend as they defeated both oppo
nents. The final scores were 8-1 
agfunst Lebanon Valley and 5-2 
against Gettysburg. Team captain 
Navroze Marshall commented that 
the win against Gettysburg was a 
gjood win and a confidence builder 
sjince they were a strong team.
' For a rare time this season, the 
tpain was at full strength as they 
sought to prove their potential for this 
vfeeks tournament.
 Team captain Navroze Marshall 
lid, The team is looking pretty 
;rong... We have not had a full team 
fir most of the year due to injuries,
but now everyone is looking pretty 
sharp.
The womens team did not win, but 
played close matches. Freshman 
Jillian Watkins felt that the matches 
were beneficial in terms of physical 
conditioning.
Watkins said, We used the 
matches to get back into swing of 
things. Despite the losses, we still 
feel confident for the UAAs.
The women play one more match 
this week at home against the Uni
versity of Pittsburgh before the 
UAAs. The mens match against 
Washington & Jefferson was can
celed so the team will use the week to 
practice.
Optimism is running high in an
ticipation of the UAAs. Freshman 
Karen Tuxen said, We have a very 
good team this year and we are 
very motivated, so we expect to do 
well.
Marshall added that inexperience 
could hurt the teams, but said that 
the teams are very confident and 
have an excellent chance of doing 
better than last year.

Virtual booth steals show
PULP FREE
By Eric Salzman
I emerged 
from my 
house the 
other day to 
find out that 
Carnival con
sists of more 
than just 
buggy. The 
folks I live 
with were
shocked when I told them. Being the competitive 
little goober that I am, I decided to make my very 
own booth. Ill probably win.
. I have produced CMUs very first virtual booth. 
Can you compete with that? I dont think so.
When you see a computer and a big leather 
contraption out on Midway, that will be my booth. 
All you have to do is give me a buck, strap yourself 
into the leather suit (which has all sorts of nifty 
electronic impulses in it), and experience the great
est board game experience of all time.
In my booth, youll be able to choose from a 
variety of different games. In Chutes and Ladders, 
youll actually feel the sliding sensation of moving 
down a Plexiglas half-tube at 50 miles per hour. 
When climbing ladders, the experience will be so 
real that youll even feel the splinters in your hand.
In Candyland, the electronic impulse sensor in 
your mouth will offer the tastebud stimulation of 
candy canes, chocolate bars, danishes, and even 
vegemite (yum, love that vegemite).
For those bold enough to choose Dungeons and 
Dragons, beware of the chamber with the dragon 
because you will feel the heat of his mighty flame 
spewing throat. Practice runs throughactually re
sulted in mild bums, but its fixed now.
There are so many more games that my virtual 
booth is sure to be a favorite among the kiddies 
whose attention span just cant be satisfied with
one plain old wooden structure. Im also sure to be 
a favorite with the environmentalists as my booth 
doesnt result in non biodegradable foam strewn 
across campus.
Organizations that spent a small fortune on 
constructing their booths are sure to be the most 
envious folks on Midway after going though my 
exhibit. The leather for the suit was easy enough to 
come by as England is now going so far as to ship 
cows overseas to anyone who will take them. The 
software I used was all available on the net. And 
the extra memory I need to run the program, well, 
we all know how accessible that is.
I walk around the quad and other construction 
sites thinking how silly all these booth builders 
are. They spend hours and hours working with 
each other to construct these wooden and foam 
(bad foam, bad) structures that cant even operate 
without human aide. Sweating out in the sun with 
that awful music blaring as they work, these people 
are really putting effort into their booths. I created 
my virtual booth in a number of hours sitting in the 
comfort of Cyert with kids all around me playing 
real games like Doom, Puyo Puyo, and Donkey 
Kong. No sweating for me, uh-uh.
When youre out on Midway this weekend, keep 
an eye open for Carnivals first virtual booth. Im 
thinking of giving it a name like Pathetic Para
dise or For those of you who really suck and cant 
appreciate the beauty and craftsmanship of all the 
real booths, come try this one! Im leaning toward 
the latter, but I think it needs an abbreviation. If 
you have any suggestions, please post them to the 
following web site, http://www.get.a.life, 
and.get.off.the.machine/.
Eric Salzman is a junior philosophy major. He 
looks forward to Carnival weekend as a time when 
CMU students may actually speak to one another if 
they arent too stoned to form sentences.
Carnival promises fun
RnmTcnFe usEd o[.N Fc
during the football season, 
but a special 45 minute 
spring showing will take 
place Thursday, April 18 at 6 
pm. As an added bonus, the 
band is planning a vocal 
piece. We 
might surprise 
you with a song, 
but its (the 
band) not meant 
for singing, 
said Jenna 
Sweterlitsch, a 
junior MechE 
major. Dressed 
in kilts, the 50 
member band 
has been prac
ticing once a 
week to prepare 
for the Carnival 
show.
A puppet 
show by the 
Were Holding 
Puppets Com
pany will be per
forming two shows on April 
19. Charlie Holden, a regu
lar puppeteer for the 
Childrens Museum, along 
with Laura Opshinsky, will 
perform Gastons World of 
Puppets and Barely Spring 
at 4 pm.
Handwriting analysis is
another activity planned for 
Carnival. On April 19 at 1 pm, 
Sharon Davison will be analyz
ing individuals personality 
traits and abilities. A variety of 
written quotations, pictures, 
posters, and crafts will also be
Graphic courtesy 
on display. This will be a fun 
and enjoyable experience for all, 
said Davison.
The Mighty Mighty Bosstones 
will be headlining on Saturday, 
April 20 on the Cut.
WRCT, CMUs radio station, 
has many plans for Carnival. 
The station has arranged to have
S.W.O.B., a band that has 
been playing the local Pitts
burgh scene for several years, 
perform Thursday night at 7 
pm on the Midway stage. 
Steve Boyle, the bands gui
tarist and vocalist said, 
Were shooting 
for the top. 
The band re
cently went on 
tour to several 
cities including 
Detroit, Chi
cago, and 
Philedelphia. 
Were hoping to 
be signed based 
on that tour, 
said Boyle. The 
four member 
band plays mu
sic with a. con
temporary style.
WRCT also 
plans to have a 
truck at Midway
____________ for thier live
Spring Carnival broadcast. The 
station will be giving away 
items such as posters and 
stickers.
Also, the station will be do
ing its traditional live broad
cast of the buggy races. Four 
knowledgable commentators 
will be monitoring the com
petition.
Board Game booths add to Carnival excitement
x Httare usEd o[.N Fc
event. Individual jobs outside of that 
' meet about 3 or 4 hours a week. As you 
et closer towards its about 18-20 
iiours per week, said Howard Meisner, 
^Carnival Chair.
Christa Sherwood, Publicity Chair can 
relate to the amount of work that is put 
Jin. Its a full time job. Before about 3 
weeks ago I was spending about 10-15 
 hours a week. Then, 3 weeks ago I began 
spending 20 hours, usually more than 
that.
.! Neeraj Bansal, Operations Chair said, 
It consumes a lot of your time. Even 
i when youre not here working on Camijval, you might be sitting in class and 
thinking about all of the things you have 
jjto do.
i Many of the current Carnival Chairs 
have helped out in the past, and they all 
agree that their efforts and sacrifices 
i'were well worth it.
 | Bansal said, Its great to put on a 
show that brings this campus to life at 
least once a year. It makes you feel 
good.
;; I believe that Carnival brings the 
! whole campus together, he said. The 
booth construction part of Carnival is 
very busy; however as Midway Chairperson, I get to see the interaction of
organizational members working oneon-one with each other. That is some
thing that needs to be seen more often 
all over campus.
Carnival will have new 
meaning for a few organiza
tions on campus like Zeta,
SigEp, and SARC (Student 
Alumni Relations Council), 
who are presenting booths for 
the first time.
Doug Brady, President of 
SigEp, found his experience 
building a booth this year with 
his fraternity to be a memo
rable one. It feels really great.
Its been a good time. Weve 
had a few problems, we dont 
have much knowledge based 
on booths, but were overcom
ing those problems. I encour
age everyone to get involved 
in Carnival in some way be
cause it makes carnival much 
more fun.
Stefanie Sicard, co-chair of 
booth for Zeta, expressed similar sentiments about her 
sororitys first time presenting a booth. 
Were very excited about it. Its been a 
lot of work. Its actually gone a lot 
smoother than we anticipated. Every
one is really supportive. Every single to the project, then do it. Its a big 
sister has put in a minimum of 10 booth commitment, it really is. The most imhours throughout the week. portant thing is having people that are
willing to go to the meetings 
and you need strong leader
ship because it is alot ofwork. 
The booths this year will be 
impressive as always. Many 
of the organizations went out 
of their way to use environ
mentally friendly materials 
in building their booths.
J enna Yerger, Entranceway 
Chair, said this about her 
booth. We used the same 
frame across the top that we 
used last year. We intended 
for it to be used for several 
years. We also have no blue 
foam, a popular booth mate
rial, because it isnt environ
mentally friendly. Instead, we 
used cardboard boxes which 
are recyclable.
KDR was one of the first 
organizations to move their 
booths onto Midway. The po
lice stopped traffic while they

supportive cheering and clapping. 
Darlene Ailing, Midway Chair of Carni

May, reflects upon her feelings that 
day. She said, It was a big emotional 
moment for everybody. I started crying. 
We all were really happy for them;

Spirit Week kicks off

\ If the thought of Spring Car; nival doesnt get the CMU 
I campus excited enough this 
; week, ResLife is hoping that 
{Spirit Week will. For the four 
[ days leading up to Carnival, 
students are encouraged to 
wear specific t-shirts to show 
their pride in the CMU com
munity. Each day, if you 
stop by the Fence from noon 
to one in the right t-shirt, 
youll get a free gift.
Today is Plaid and

The idea sprung from an
other ResLife campaign to get
people involved on campus and 
give away candy bars. In the 
fall they solicited Good Ideas 
from the people on campus for 
ways to improve CMU and the 
community spirit. One of the 
ideas was for everyone to wear 
their Orientation t-shirt again organizer at Residence Life, 
on the same day. The idea was thinks Spirit Week could beembraced byResLife, who 
spread it around to other cam

it falls flat, it falls flat, but its 
worth trying. Its not a mo

for sure, but it should be fun. 
Jennifer Church, another
Julee White/Tartan Assistant Features Editor
Eventually, it grew into a week 
of T-shirts, and what better time 
to do it than before Carnival, 
when campus comes alive any
way?
Tim Foster of Residence Life 
feels that its important to have 
events like Spirit Week on cam
pus. We dont do enough on 
campus to celebrate pride in
come another CMU tradition 
like booth and buggy during 
Carnival. I hope its some
thing we can develop into a 
tradition, she said. I dont 
see why we cant try some
thing new and see it catch 
on with all the students. 
Foster also said he doesnt 
think the CMU campus is 
apathetic, just that spirit 
and pride are decentralized. 
Carnival is one of the tilings 
that bring people together. 
Theres a lot of energy and a 
lot of investment on campus. 
Were trying to figure out how 
to channel that incredible en
ergy into a celebratory kind of 
energy. He hopes that Spirit 
Week will be one of the ways to 
do just that.
Church encouraged everyone 
to get involved and wear their 
T-shirts. Its one less thing to 
decide in the morning, she 
said. And stop by the Fence 
and get free food.

Vigil promotes awareness
By PERRIN ROWLAND
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Cupping hands behind their 
caiidles to keep the late afterchance to talk about alcohol re
lated issues and the brave told 
personal stories.
Trask founded Strange Brew 
after a friend of hers suffered
noon breeze from blowing them 
out, Strange Brew met last 
Thursday to hold an open vigil 
in recognition of those whose 
livps have been negatively 
effected[sic] by alcohol. 
Foiinded last semester by Holly 
Tra'sk, a senior psychology ma
jor,' they are an alcohol aware
ness group formed to educate 
students on safe drinking prac
tices. The candlelight vigil, or
ganized by Michele Mellott, a 
ju.iiior psychology major, was to 
speak for itself. There was no 
lecturer, only a poem about a 
girl killed in a drunk driving 
accident. The group offered a
the tragedy of losing a friend 
due to alcohol poisoning. Many 
in their group have had per
sonal experiences with alcohol
ism and problem drinkers. They 
hope to educate on safe drink
ing and to give out information 
about alcoholism and its warn
ing signs. We all have differ
ent opinions on what we should 
do. Were coming together with 
the common purpose to teach 
safe drinking, said Katherine 
Wickiser, a junior psychology 
major and the Chairman of Edu
cation for the group.
But this isnt Alcoholics 
Anonymous. The group does
give support to each other but 
members dont have to talk or 
have a problem. Theyre here 
to discuss issues of alcoholism 
specifically in regard to CMU 
campus.
There no other organization 
like this that has addressed 
the issue of alcohol  except to 
drink it, Wickiser.
But they are not preaching 
against drinking. Just be re
sponsible. Be careful. There 
are other things to take into 
consideration [when you 
drink], said Mellott.
Trask began discussion at 
the vigil with a poignant story 
of her own experiences with 
alcoholism.
Senior professional writing 
major Laura McClure worked 
in conjunction with the 
Morewood/Residence Life Staff 
to put together a week of pro
gramming dealing with alco
hol related issues.
The main purpose was to 
get people to be conscious of 
things they might take for 
granted, she said. For ex
ample, that we all have to be 
[drunk] on Carnival.
McClure doesnt feel that stu
dents are aware of the effects 
of their decisions and the ne
cessity to pre-plan possible situ
ations. People need to know 
what to do if they see someone 
sloppy drunk or in danger. The 
focus is to find moderation in 
drinking, McClure said.

CRACKING THE MYTH womens lives, 
By Amber Benezra tKOwJa7yoi.11 TN Ti JN NC[ NiNVinKmini VV[ NNiNCNTNNN roofies cre
ates a new di
mension in awareness and fear. Also known 
as ruffles, rope, rib, and R2, roofies are 
flunitrazepam manufactured under the brand 
name rophynol; a potent tranquilizer similar 
to Valium and illegal in the United States. 
The drug produces a sedative effect, amnesia, 
muscle relaxation, and a slowing of psychomo
tor responses. Sedation occurs 20-30 minutes 
after it is taken, and lasts several hours. 
Roofies are imported from Mexico and South 
America and sold in their original bubble pack
aging  most often to high school and college 
students.
Since their appearance in the early 1990s, 
police in states like Florida and Texas have 
noted a severe increase in the number of date 
rapes reported; all in which the woman cannot 
remember the events of the night of the rape, 
even if she had not been drinking. Bob Nichols, 
an assistant state prosecutor in Fort Lauder
dale, Florida has been involved in five sexualbattery cases connected to roofies in the past 
.five months. I dont know why its suddenly 
on the scene. Its been around awhile. The 
pattern with the rapes is that high school and 
college kids are slipping it into drinks at night
clubs and pick-up joints.
According to the US Drug Enforcement 
Agency, when combined with alcohol, roofies 
have an increased effect, producing disinhibition and amnesia, and sometimes respiratory 
depression, aspiration, and even death. If 
taken repeatedly, the drug can cause physical 
and mental dependence.
While most popular in the Southern states, 
roofies have been connected to rapes every
where from Illinois to California. Many casesaccount that roofies have been slipped into 
drinks at fraternity parties and other college ! 
social gatherings to lower the inhibitions of ! 
women there.
Horrifyingly enough, women have reported 
wakingup in fraternities withno clothes on, in 
unfamiliar surroundings, with evidence of 
sexual assault.
When I first heard about roofies, I thought it 
was just some kind of rumor. Something you 
hear on Hard Copy, something designed to 
play into the politics of rape and oppress women' 
by making them more afraid.
But as I did research, I found that sources 
across the country from the Orange County 
Register in California to the Emergency Re
sponse and Research Institute in Chicago were 
reporting cases of sexual assault linked to' 
roofies.
I wanted to write about this to make women 
aware that there is a drug popular among 
people our age that perpetuates sexual vio
lence. The amnesia-producing effect of roofies 
not only erases memories of the rape, but may 
prevent women from remembering how they: 
were given the drug.
I dont want to victimize women, I dont 
want every woman to lock herself in her house 
and live in fear forever. I want to inform 
women about this drug so that we can stand up 
and tell the men that use this drug on women, 
WE WILL NOT BE RAPED.
By just acknowledging the danger of roofies, 
we can take steps to prevent its use in date 
rape  by not accepting open drinks from 
people we dont know at bars, or frat parties, . 
by remembering that 85% of all rape victims 
know their rapist, by watching out for each : 
other, and if we do think weve been given a 
roofie, to call the police, go to the hospital, and 
report it.

Holocaust readings allow students to remember
By LAUREN HEINZ
Tartan Contributing Editor
To remember.
That is the purpose ofYom Hashoa, or 
Holocaust Day, which will be observed 
in multiple ways across the world Tues
day to honor the six million Jews, gyp
sies and homosexuals that were killed in 
the Holocaust.
At Carnegie Mellon, the day will be 
observed through a 24-hour reading of 
Holocaust victims names, a dramatic 
presentation at Soldiers and Sailors 
Memorial Hall Monday night, and an 
art installation on campus stretching 
from Forbes Avenue to Hunt Library.
Senior directing major Daniella Topol 
and Michael Robertson, a first year 
masters student in arts management, 
have signed up 144 students, faculty 
and staff members to read names at ten 
minute intervals from midnight Mon
day until midnight Tuesday at the Fence.
President Robert Mehrabian and Dean 
of Student Affairs Michael Murphy will 
take part in the reading, which will 
broadcast for five hours by WRCT.
Rabbi Art Donsky of the Jewish Uni
versity Center, which is helping to spon
sor the event, will lead a memorial ser
vice there at 5 pm on Tuesday.
This is the second year Topol has pio
neered the remembrance, an event she 
hopes will continue on campus in later 
years and also expand into a wider Pitts
burgh community commemoration.
Its so much easier not to remember 
the Holocaustit takes energy. But the 
names are still there. The grief is still 
there, Topol said. I think its crucial 
that young people take part in this re
membrance. I wasnt even alive when 
the Holocaust happened, but I will still
remember it. I have to remember it.
Robertson said its important for college-age people to take part in such an 
event because many students dont know 
a lot about the Holocaust and were 
never taught about it in school.
You dont have to be Jewish for the 
Holocaust to mean something to you. 
Not only can we learn by reading the 
names and talking to survivors and 
listening, but we can participate in the 
remembrance, Robertson said.
A community wide observance of 
Yom Hashoa will be held today at 
7:30 pm in the Soldiers and Sailors. 
Admission is free.
Leigh Silverman, a senior direct
ing major, will direct a dramatic 
presentation she wrote which fol
lows the themes of justice and re
membrance. She said she structured 
the skit much like a Jewish prayer.
Three acting majors, junior Tressa 
Pope, sophomore Dagmara 
Dominczyk and freshman Jenna 
Kalinowski will take part in the 
presentation. When you think about 
the Holocaust, where do you begin to 
find the justice? What I realized is 
that the justice is our remembering, 
and the honoring of both the dead 
and the survivors, Silverman said.
Eli Rosenbaum, director of the Office 
of Special Investigations, will give the 
keynote address  Nazi Crimes and 
their Perpetrators: Justice and Remem
brance  at the observance. There will 
also be an art exhibit, kaddish (prayer 
of mourning) and candle lighting ser
vice.
I think its great that we can be part 
of a bigger Pittsburgh observance. This 
keeps the celebration open to many dif
ferent kinds of people and improves
communication, Silverman said.
Malchus Janocko, a masters student 
in set design, created an art installation 
for Yom Hashoa which consists of 60 
wood posts, each about six feet high, 
that have Xeroxed photos of Holocaust 
victims mounted on one side, and a rel
evant quotation on the reverse side.
installation that would be powerful with
out being too gruesome or horrific. He 
included pictures of people smiling or 
laughing, not just the destitute.
Im really trying to show the people 
themselves. To have a photograph re
ally gives a sense of who that person 
might have been. The images are so
One sign reads: You want to go back powerful, Janocko said. People arent 
to your mother? You dont have a mother going to need to be told what this is for. 
anymore. That smoke coming out of that Theyll know.
Robertson said he 
hoped the remem
brance would resonate 
for students and pro
fessors on campus, if 
just to make them 
think.
Events make 
people think. It will 
make a difference if a 
student is walking 
across the Cut and sees 
a friend or a professor 
at the podium reading 
names. Seeing them 
will make them ask 
why, and then they 
will learn about it, 
Robertson said.
Topol said many of 
the people who signed 
up for last years reading re-applied this 
year, but that many new students and 
staff members have signed up to read. 
To meet the demand, Topol reduced last 
years 15-minute reading time down to 
ten minutes so that more people could 
read.
The reading of the names seems to call 
up deep human emotions of sympathy 
and regret as reciting a persons name, 
where they were killed and their age 
bring meaning to the daunting figure of
Wod[HN[a GaT&aoa*Gdowd[ Et[woNkiwN[. (yNwto
chimney is your mother,told to Tova 
Baron, a child living at Auchwitz.
Another reads: Among the death 
marches from Birkenau was one which 
lasted for more than six weeks. Of the 
3,000 that set foot, only 280 survived.
There are pictures of children, teenag
ers and women and men both young and 
old. An avid researcher of the Holocaust,
Janocko has been collectingimagesfrom 
historical books for more than five years.
Janocko said he wanted to create an
six million lost lives.
We are always told as young Jewish 
children tozachor which means remem
ber in Hebrew, and Daniella and her 
vigil have made sure that the CMU 
community will zachor the Holocaust 
and its victims, said Heather Amet, a 
senior directing major. I dont think I 
knew the meaning of zachor until I read 
the names at the first vigil. It was a 
rainy Pittsburgh day and as I stood in 
the rain with those books of names in 
front of me, all I could think of was their 
ages... Miriam age three, Nachon age 
six, Zev age two months.
For some, Yom Hashoa has a truly 
personal connection.
I choose to read the names because 
the Holocaust is something which di
rectly affected my family. My grand
mother lost brothers and sisters in the 
Holocaust and met my grandfather for 
the first time on the trip from Germany 
to America. I feel it is my responsibility 
and privilege to honor my grandparents 
and the countless other Jews who sur
vived the Holocaust for their strength, 
as well as to pay tribute to those who did 
not survive, said Michele Kalman, a 
junior vocal performance major.
And the Holocaust has meaning for 
the non-Jewish, simply because of the 
statement it makes about history and 
human behavior.
It is probably the most awful thing 
mankind has ever done, and that has a 
weight that simply should not be forgot
ten, said Matt Morrow, a senior direct
ing major.
As I was reading the names last year, 
I lost it, the list of people killed in the 
Holocaust is almost never ending. And 
as I was reading them, I was going 
through entire families, just wiped out.
Buggy leaves impact on CMU history, student tells its story
By JAMES STEPANEK
Tartan Staffwriter
Well now that carnival is 
right around the bend youve 
probably noticed some strange 
activities that go on at night 
and on weekend mornings if 
you have a car. Its probably 
caused you some form of confu
sion or inconvenience. The 
closed roads and interesting 
people inhabiting streets at odd 
hours may have left a strange 
impression. So whats going 
on? you may ask. This is buggy 
or Sweepstakes. Sweepstakes 
is one of the things that makes 
CMU unique. It is a race which 
consists of buggies which are 
pushed up hill and rolled down 
hill. A small woman usually 
drives it and it tends to be tor
pedo shaped with three wheels 
and that is about the end of 
what generalizations apply to 
buggy. There are many people 
involved in this sport on cam
pus, but the rest of you folks 
probably wonder what the hell 
all of it is about. For those who 
have done this before I will not 
only be doing an introduction, 
but a set of predictions based 
on my observations from 
freerolls and push practices this 
year. This will, of course, be 
helped along be a heaping help
ing of rumors which I have col
lected throughout the year.
> I can remember when I first 
joined a buggy organization all 
those years ago.
You have to be at freerolls, 
thats at dawn on a weekend 
they told me.
What? Dawn exists on a 
weekend ?!? I thought to my
self.
I persevered in one way or 
another and managed to make 
ifj to rolls. In fact I actually 
managed to get interested in 
rj)lls and the rest of the mania 
that is Sweepstakes. Unfortu
nately this involves a whole lot 
of time put into a rather strange 
sink. You spend hours and 
hours working to win a race 
which only CMU people care 
about. There are mechanics, 
design people, drivers and 
pushers. Mechanics maintain 
the buggies and race prep them. 
Designers build them, and en
hance their appearance for the 
design competition. The driv
ers, who are, as previously 
mentioned, just about all small 
women these days, pilot the odd
vehicles around the course. 
They actually have a job which 
in envied by many a mechanic 
and designer who, while they 
spend hours making these cre
ations, never get to try them 
themselves. The pushers, the 
other half of the equation with 
the buggies, work out and prac
tice technique for their time of 
glory which will amount to 
somewhere under twenty sec
onds each (thats two days of 
races if true glory is involved). 
Of course there is also 
the nebulous support 
category with flaggers, 
sweepers, chute
flaggers, timers, and all 
the rest who fill in the 
gaps. Mind you describ
ing all of these positions 
independently is not 
that accurate since there 
is very often overlap in 
who does what.
The time commitment 
is huge. You sacrifice 
weekend mornings and 
most weekday nights at 
the very least. The de
signers and mechanics 
lose even more time. 
Freerolls are the week
end morning practice 
runs which allow driv
ers to garner experience 
rolling the course. To 
qualify for races a driver 
has to attain a pro
scribed number of rolls 
in the buggy she will be 
competing in. Freerolls 
occur at this ungodly 
hour simply because thats the 
only time that the city will grant 
a permit to close a stretch of 
public streets. There is also 
push practice which is when 
pushers get to try their hands 
at pushing the buggies up the 
course as they will on raceday. 
This occurs late at night for 
permit reasons (and to get out 
of the way of traffic) as well. 
Push practice often runs until 
2:00 AM for some organizations, 
so it is easy to understand that 
this is a major commitment of 
time and effort.
Now why do we do this? I 
cant say. Why do people climb 
mountains? I guess its a chal
lenge. In fact its a hell of a 
challenge and one which evolves 
with time and technology. It 
pits the best this school, which 
is no mediocre institution, has 
to offer against each other. It 
allows tests of engineering and
physical prowess to coincide and 
result in a very exciting and 
gripping race.
The race is about as old as the 
university, having started in the 
early twentieth century. Rules 
were a bit different then as were 
buggy designs and course itself. 
The race was between teams 
from different fraternities and 
meant as a display of engineer
ing, design and mechanical com
petence. Mechanical compe
tence was shown in many ways 
including a gladly lapsed rule
Groups display buggies in the gym.
which stated that the buggies 
had to stop after the chute (the 
turn at the end of the downhill 
rolling portion) and the driver 
had to get out and rotate the 
tires. This rule was removed to 
enhance the excitement of the 
race.
Buggy technology has long 
been a key factor in the race. 
Buggies began looking like soap
box derby cars with brothers of 
the fraternity driving in a sit
ting position. I have inspected a
buggy which remains from the 
fifties, and it is quite large with 
shock absorbers and a quite 
advanced steering system. The 
technology began to change in 
the sixties when advanced alu
minum alloys and the notion of 
driving head first were intro
duced. Of course there are few 
people youll meet on campus 
wholl remember this kind of 
buggy, but some professors will. 
They had four wheels and con
sisted of a tube made of alumi
num and a nose cone probably 
made of sheet 
metal or fiber
glass. They were 
also quite heavy. 
A buggy of that 
era weighed 
around a hun
dred pounds 
even without the 
driver. Lucky for 
the pushers of 
today that num
ber has dropped 
sharply. The last 
of the four wheel 
buggies were 
phased out in the 
late eighties. 
The last, I be
lieve was Black 
Magic, CIAs 
buggy which col
lected a few first 
place trophies in 
its day.
The Six
ties also saw in 
introduction of 
the independent 
organizations. Fringe was the 
first of them. They were fol
lowed by CIAj SDC, Pioneers, 
and Spirit (not in this order). 
This changed the nature of the 
competition from a Greek only 
event into a more campus wide 
event. CIA was the first of the 
independents to win the race , 
with triumphs in the late sev
enties and early eighties. CIA 
no longer competes possibly 
owing to a rather sorry finish 
last year (eat your liver Lou).
Spirit is the current champ of 
the independents having won 
Sweepstakes six time since 
1987. This is a remarkable 
achievement for an organiza
tion which only stared partici
pating in Sweepstakes in the 
mid eighties. SDC is also prov
ing to be a competitor, with a 
number of good finishes in re
cent years.
The early eighties featured 
the introduction of the three 
wheel buggies as the dominant 
breed. Legend, from Pi Lambda 
Phi, was one of the earliest. It 
was not from one of the major 
buggy organizations so it never 
finished in a winning position. 
Lemur from Sigma Nu was the 
first of the three wheelers to 
win the race. That was back in 
1982. Since then all organiza
tions have gone over to three 
wheelers. That is, except for the 
flirtation with two-wheel de
signs which was practiced by 
Delta-Upsilon throughout the 
eighties. This was a tumultu
ous history which featured a 
consistent replay of the buggies 
falling over and not finishing 
the race. The history of twowheelers culminated in 1988
when Delta Upsilons King Ei
der turned in a 2:08 course time 
the first day only to fall over 
shortly after the hill two pushoff 
the second day. After this dis
play the rules were changed to 
disallow the design due to in
herent safety and stability prob
lems.
The advent of composites such 
as fiberglass and kevlar have 
done a great deal to make the 
buggies much lighter. Their 
weight has dropped from over 
seventy pounds fifteen years ago 
to some organizations having 
buggies weighing in well under 
thirty pounds (this is sans 
driver of course). Of course the 
other aspect of buggy technol
ogy is tires, which is easily the 
topic on which organizations are 
the most tight lipped. This is 
due to the simple fact that fast 
tires mean a fast buggy. If you 
expect more information on 
that, dont ask me.
Of course one now has to won
der as to the future of buggy 
designs. There seem to be two 
schools which are in eminence 
at the moment. There is the 
one wheel in front as in the

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  15 April 1996
Buggy enthusiasm reflects time and dedication
By JESSICA STRELITZ
Tartan Staffwriter
AS a tour guide, part of the tour route is a stop in 
fro'iit of Baker Hall. There I usually talk about 
Scltenley Park; the ice rink, running paths and 
movies in the summertime on Flagstaff Hill.
Then, I pause and take a breath,
Probably the most famous event 
that takes place around Schenley 
liowfever, are the Buggy races 
during Spring Carnival.
I Wait and can only imagine the 
images of horse-drawn carriages 
whipping along Frew Street, as 
they pop into prospective stu
dents families minds.
"Now buggy itself is a compli
cated to explain. Envision a push
cart! like high tech soapbox racerstrfe'amlined and low to the 
ground, with three wheels. Now, 
sticK a bar on the back of it at a 60 
degree angle. Thats a buggy.
Usually they stare back at me 
with blank or confused faces. It 
d worse as I go on about the 
seflFch for the perfect driver, col
lapsible pushbars, training till 2 
am, flirting with danger as a 
Dagger, and pepper in various 
ternis such as 'windows, chutes 
and the ultimate crown as King of 
Hill .1.
Usually they are impressed at 
thispoint, but still thoroughly confused. They are 
impressed even more when I explain the time, 
money and dedication that goes into one of the 
longest held traditions at Carnegie Mellon. But no 
onecan get the true feeling of Race Day unless they 
experience it  either as a spectator, driver, push 
captain, mechanic or, God forbid, a buggy chair.
Last year, after months of midnight, mid-week 
rolls and pre-dawn, hungover hale bale set-ups, 
it all came down to Saturday at 7 am, when the 
preliminary races of Carnival 95 began.
Spirit had been projected by CompuBookie, as 
the team to beat in both the Mens and Womens 
races; with Beta, Pika, Sig Nu and Phi Kap to
indeed Sig Nu A, trailing by almost eight seconds 
but there was a surprise third place showing by 
Pioneers A team, trailing Sig Nu by 10 seconds.
This year Pioneers buggy chair, Chris 
McCormack, is very optimistic about his women, 
saying that they are Ready to race and faster 
than last year. Look for Beta and Phi Kap women
Hundreds of man hours go Into designing the perfect buggys, which are displayed before the race day.

round out the top five in mens and Sig Nu and 
Spirit B to round out the top three in womens.
But as with any great race, there were some 
upsets and surprises last year. It was indeed 
Spirit A who took the Womens 1st place trophy 
easily, breaking the course record for women 
with a final time of 2:33:03. Second place was
to also be great competitors come May 20th. Phi 
Kap womens push team captain, Tracy Bach says 
Were talented, were confident and ready to 
roll.
The top five Mens teams last year made for 
heart stopping excitement. A little under two 
seconds separated the top five finishers. No one
expected the astounding upset by Pika, as they  
beat Spirit A by .29 of a second, repeating their top - 
finish of1994. Spirit was chased closely by SDC A, 
who garnered their third place spot by margin of 
.59 of a second. Their time of 2:10:88, shocked the 
crowd and themselves.
The mens top five was rounded out with Spirit  
B just beating PKT A by .06 of a second. SDC is 
hoping to repeat their stellar performance and 
make a name for themselves in the years to come. 
SDC, Beta and Spirit are all revealing new bug
gies for 1996.
Look for Sig Nu and Beta to be competitors to 
taste the top five this year. Sigma Nu was disap
pointed in last years showing and know that they 
will place much higher this year. Pika and Phi Kap 
should be neck and neck.
Theta Xi is crossing their fingers that someone 
remembers to weld the push bar onto the buggy 
this year. Meanwhile, watch for KDRs newNazgul, ' 
as well as Kappa Sig^ heralded baby buggy and 1 
contendable push team. Delta Upsilon, whb 
scratched both teams on race day last year, guar
antees a showing this year.
So as the Big Dance at CMU approaches, get 
your butt out of bed for what should prove to be 1 
another series of nailbiting mornings. Bring a 1 
blanket, bring a raincoat, and cheer for your favor- 1 
ite named buggy (with names like Sambuca and 
Schadenfruede (if you know what it means!) 
how can you go wrong?
Pray that dark clouds dont menace over the top 
of Hill Four, hope for windows till the plug on Hill 
Three and remember the words of Audi 
Hanpachern, DTDs Buggy Chairman, Anything 
can happen on Race Day.
For Mens races I see the following finalists on 
Race Day-Spirit A, Beta A, SDC A, Spirt B, Phi 
Kap A.
For Womens races I see the following top five 
finishers-Spirit A, Phi Kap A, Beta A, Sig Nu A,; 
Pioneers A,Student predicts winners from past experience
rcatm,e usEd o[.N F]
Spi^jt design. It is merely an evolu
tionary progression towards a more 
aerodynamic design of the standard 
one wheel in front buggy. Spirits adop
tion (they were pioneered by other 
irganizations) of wheel farings is part 
of this aerodynamic consideration. 
This is a straightforward adaptation 
of the design originated in Legend. 
For this reason Ill refer to these as 
Legend style. The other advanced de
sign is the two wheels in front, com
pletely enclosed teardrop design. Two 
wheels in front buggies have been 
around for quite a while with examples 
from SDC, Fringe, Phi Kappa Theta, 
CIA, and Pioneers. The Fringe ex
ample, Lunatic, was completely en
closed in a shell and possibly inspired 
Sigma Nus Jama which was the first 
of this type to make the top five, with 
third place finish in 1990. Since 
Fringe dismantled Lunatic to make it 
Legend style, I will refer to these buggiess as Jama style.
Spirit has had their design imi
tated by many organizations includ
ing Phi Kappa Theta and SDC. Spirit
first stunned observers with a course 
record of 2:06.2 with Quantum Leap 
in 1988 introducing this design. Phi 
Kappa Theta managed to come in sec
ond in 1994 and fifth last year with 
their entry showing what has evolved 
into a solid position as one of the top 
buggy organizations. Sigma Nu had a 
disappointing showing last year with 
a marked loss of speed the second day. 
Pi Kappa Alpha won last years Sweep
stakes with a buggy of the Jama type. 
This was quite a milestone since it 
was the first time in the last ten years 
that an organization other than Spirit 
has won back to back first place tro
phies. Delta Upsilon has also made a 
buggy of this design as has Beta this 
year. Im of the opinion that the Jama 
style is likely to be the design of the 
future.
Last year was a funny raceday in 
which two of the major organizations, 
Spirit and Sigma Nu, had to race 
against their own teams on the second 
day. This is not a situation desirable 
to any organization since it puts too 
many demands on the truck crew. As 
one would expect neither organization
did as well as first day.
OK, I suppose its time for some 
predictions. I mean background is all 
well and good but people really want 
some gossip. Ive only been to a small 
number of rolls this year, but that 
wasnt helped by the wretched weather 
weve had this year. Also due to less 
than perfect management by the 
sweepstakes people, rolls just havent 
been as production as they have been 
in the past. Im willing to bet that 
some organizations are having 
troubles getting qualified. I did man
age to take in the first day of truck 
weekend, the final weekend of 
freerolls. (Named as such since many 
organizations rent trucks to do full 
race prep).
What do I expect? I see Pika winning 
it again. They simply have the fastest 
buggies by a margin, though their push 
team may still be as lackluster as it 
was last year. Pika simply blew people 
away this Saturday with a damned 
fast set of rolls. Spirit has yet to show 
what their buggies can do.
I know, from experience, that Spirit 
can pull something out on raceday
which they havent shown before, but 
given the paucity of rolls this spring, 
you cant predict what will happen 
with the driving. Even on truck week
end they still havent yet shown us 
much. Beta has a most impressive push 
team (as always), but theyre going to 
be running a new buggy (Jama type), 
and their mechanical competence has 
been lacking in recent years. The way 
theyve been rolling has been ques
tionable. They get to the chute at good 
speed but their turns, and loss of rub
ber are costing them a lot. If they get 
it together they could be a contender.
Sigma Nu has lost some push team 
strength, and hasnt yet managed to 
show off their speed of earlier years. 
However there is still another day this 
weekend for them to redeem them
selves. They could surprise people. 
SDC, after a most impressive finish 
last year, reportedly has all of their 
fast pushers from last year, so I expect 
they will do well in spite of being 
another no show in Alls.
Actually theyve shown a pretty in
ept mechanical ability in rolls, but 
reported course times from this week
end have them doing really well (I 
question the time I heard). Phi Kap is 
the other team which I see rounding 
out the top ten somewhere. They have ' 
been rolling pretty well and usually 
muster a good team. Also Pioneers has 
rolled pretty well, but I have heard' 
nothing about their push team.
The slots will be filled by these teams 
and a selection of B teams from these 
organizations. Let me give you a:' 
tenative list of the top ten:
1. Pika A
sv Spirit A
3. SDC A aq
Dv Beta A
5. Phi Kap A
6. Spirit B
7. Sigma Nu A W
8. SDC B
9. Phi Kap B
10. Spirit C l0"
Of course you can ask how reliablfe
these are  not even a little bit. I do 1 
think I fail to carry the Compubookiel  
curse though, so Pika might still win1.- I 
Well see. As always nothing is set in 
stone and raceday should be excitingSecurity prepares for Carnival
By JOHN BIGGS
Tartan Forum Editor
Like great primordial 
beasts, booths are rising in 
the Morewood Parking Lot. 
Buggies are being greased and 
caressed, prepped and preened 
for the big races. Pounds of oil 
and batter are being churned 
out of smoking factories as 
every student waits in antici
pation for the gentle sweet
ness offunnel cakes. And Cam
pus Police is learning how to 
incapacitate victims with se
lective immobilization tech
niques. Carnival is coming.
Like many other groups on 
campus, the security depart
ment is preparing for the mirth 
and mayhem that looms on the 
horizon. Everyone has a dif
ferent aspect of it to consider, 
said Sergeant Richard Sima. 
Some officers are beginning the 
tactical training of the 30 to 40 
student monitors. OurLt. Suber 
is handling the overall supervi
sion and coordination. The big
gest aspect of it is to get the 
details right.
Some of the new tactics be
ing employed this year are the 
use of pepper spray, a nonlethal method of incapacitating 
offenders, and positional as
phyxiation, the proper way to 
hold a suspect to prevent him 
from getting away. All officers 
are being trained in these meth
ods, and some are even volun
teering to be sprayed in order to 
test the effectiveness of the or
ganic weapon.
Parking is a major concern, 
as well as traffic on Forbes. Well 
be supplying spaces in the Tech 
Garage for displaced permitholders. said Sima. Alcohol 
consumption is also a problem, 
but it is not as major as outside 
teenagers. They come into car
nival with no money and just 
stand in groups. Were going to 
be working to keep them mov
ing and out of trouble.
Sima went on to say that most 
of the problems are minor. 
There are the usual push  
and shove scuffles to contend 
with, and as it gets later, people 
get a little more rowdy, but last 
years Carnival went off pretty 
smoothly, and we expect the 
same this year," he said.
Were not anticipating any 
unusual problems. As long as 
no one gets seriously injured, 
thats the main goal, he added.
When asked for an example 
of an unusual incident that 
previously happened during 
the festivities. Sima recalled 
a near disaster that almost 
came to pass three years ago. 
The carnival ride manager 
asked me if there was a hard
ware store around that was 
open. I asked why and he said 
because he lost an eight-inch 
bolt off of a ride and said if 
any more fell out, hed have to 
shut down the ride. So hes 
looking for a hardware store 
at 8 pm because a ride lost a 
bolt. We shut down the ride. 
Nothing like that has hap
pened in a while, he said.
So when youre out enjoying 
yourself, remember that help 
is just a phone call away. Ifyou 
burn yourself on a tasty treat 
or find yourself in a ten-woman 
brawl, just call security and 
ask for Sergeant Sima.
Sima encourages students 
to act responsibly during 
Spring Carnival, taking pre
ventive measures against 
crime and alcohol abuse.

Volume 90, Issue 22DIVERSIONS
The Tartan, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania15 April 1996Mighty Mighty Bosstones headline at Spring Carnival
B# BRADLEY ZIMMERMAN
Trtan Staffwriter
 -TV \
In case you havent heard, the 
Mighty Mighty Bosstones are 
-playing Spring Carni vai this year, 
and Pittsburgh seems to be their 
hoine away from home theyve 
been through here four times in 
the last two years. I promise, if 
ifli show isnt the biggest, happi
est, all-around most fan thing 
you experience on the Midway, 
then I will eat my plaid flannel 
'GMU boxer shorts.
For the uninitiated, the 
Bosstones play a brand of music 
iifown as skacore, combining 
the upbeat caffeinated reggae 
'rhythms and horn sections of tra
ditional ska with the manic gui
tar frenzy of old-school punk. 
Other bands in this genre include 
MU330, Ruder Than You, 
Mephiskapheles, and Pittsburgh 
natives BunjieJambo. However, 
Ithe Bosstones are without a doubt 
the biggest ska band on the 
planet, .with album sales of over 2 
:million.
Youve heard the Bosstones, I

soundtrack. Plus they turned in 
a killer reworking of De

tribute album Kiss My Ass.
The Facts: MMBT hail 
from Boston (hence the 
name ... get it?). They 
started their trademark 
bad in plaid look as a 
goofy gimmick, but it has 
since evolved into a rally
ing call for the entire scene 
along the lines of the origi
nal two-tone black and 
white checkerboard pat
tern which old-school ska 
is known for. There are 
eight members of the band 
(guitar, bass, the scratchy 
vocals of Dicky Barrett, 
drums, two sax, a trom
bone, and of course Ben 
Carr, whose sole purpose 
is to dance on the stage.)

MMBT, pick up More

those will give you a good

Scotch n Soda provides entertainment with Chess piece
By JOHN BIGGS
Tartan Forum Editor
. I feel that ABBA was given a 
bum rap. They did lots of songs, 
including some that are not 
zwieback, and were from Swe
den. That alone makes them an 
import, and infinitely more 
;yaluable in the grand scheme of 
things.
: Next week you and your loved 
'ones will be able to experience 
-the power and glory of music 
written by two guys from ABBA, 
Barry Anderson and Bjorn 
Ulvaeus, in Scotch n Sodas 
performance of the Tim Rice 
musical Chess. In the spirit of 
'the Carnival atmosphere, this 
;|nusical will be a welcome addi
tion to the line-up of entertain!ment.
Chess is a musical about in
trigue and love. Featuring a 
^story by Richard Nelson and 
directed by Lawenda Jones, this 
80s hit will grace the stage of 
Rodef Shalom on April 17-21. 
The musical tells the tale of a 
;woman named Florence who is 
jk Hungarian immigrant and an 
American chess master, second 
only to Freddie, who is involved 
In a match with a Russian 
named Anatoly.
Florence first rises in the 
ranks of the World Chess-Fed
eration (not to be confused with
the WWF), assists in the defec
tion of Anatoly, and then falls 
in love with this moody and bril
liant Russian. Its a valuable 
and important story about fe
male independence in a world 
dominated by men, said Jones. 
In the end, the story says, its 
not whether you win or lose, but 
whether you played the game 
in style.
Florence is the most powerful 
woman in this play, filled with, 
as Jones explained, 100 per
cent emotion and 100 percent 
rational power to make 200 per
cent woman. She is as powerful 
as a diplomat and as every bit 
as sensitive as a mother. Over
all, the story is about planning 
and strategy. You can play life 
like a game and make a strat
egy for everything in your life, 
but its not very rewarding, said 
Jones. This is especially appli
cable at CMU where its plan, 
plan, plan. If you always have 
a plan, you wont be prepared 
for anything and victory will be 
very unfulfilling.
Scotch n Soda is a studentrun theater group that depends 
on the passion of eclectic indi
viduals who come together to 
have fun and put on plays. The 
leads are played by Will Proctor 
(graduate student, PPM) as 
Anatoly and Dan Kuhlman 
(freshman, drama) as Freddie,
and features a swing casting of 
Lisa Marinacci (junior, BHA) 
and Kimberly Sims (sophomore, 
history), both playing the pow
erful Florence on alternate 
days. The ensemble includes 
Sameer Karim (sophomore, IM), 
Saru Kumar (freshman, ECE), 
Suzanne Craig (sophomore, En
glish), and Robyn Nace (junior, 
BHA) as Svetlana.
The set will be rather simple, 
but stark. It consists of a. se
ries of cubes, periactoids, and 
platforms. Even though it 
doesnt look like much right 
now, the actors will make all 
the difference, said Kevin 
Pearce (sophomore, CivE), tech
nical designer (what is he, Win
ter?). Overall, the play depends 
on the spirit of the cast and 
crew to create the theatrical 
magic that most Broadway 
shows make up for with expen
sive sets and dramatic orches
tras.
There are many good reasons 
to see Chess this week: Its cheap 
($6 at the door or $5 before the 
show). It has music by ABBA 
and lyrics by Tim Rice. Its full 
of action and resilience. There 
is singing, dancing, and no 
kicklines. And there is the spirit 
of camaraderie that is all im
portant to student organiza
tions coming together, during 
this hectic time.
The Scotch n' Soda crew collaborate in the spring production Chess.

Skydivers, comedian, Beatles tribute highlight weekend festivities
By TRACY ODELL
\Tartan Staffwriter
[\ pome of this years Carnival enter
tainment (in addition to being all the 
tilings you would expect entertainment 
to: be, such as fun and exciting) is 
guaranteed to turn a few heads, and 
maybe even cause a few to question 
their sanity.
,If you happen to be walking by the 
Cut this Thursday afternoon and no
tice objects falling from the sky, relax, 
it is not another strange addition to 
the Pittsburgh weather mix, but rather 
the CMU skydiving club dropping in 
to start off this years Carnival festivi
ties.
Weather permitting, the skydiving 
club is scheduled to make its first 
Appearance at Spring Carnival in six 
years when 10 members of the club 
land on the Cut at 5 pm after their 
aerial maneuvers.
The skydivers will board a World 
'War II-era Beechrl8 at 4:15 pm in 
Grove City. From 8,500 feet above
ground level, they will make their jump 
and build a circular formation in 
freefall consisting of one diver en
circled by eight others while a camera
man tapes from outside the circle. The 
middle jumper will deploy bis para
chute so watchers on the ground will
be able to locate the ______________
divers. Shortly after, 
the remaining jump
ers will deploy their 
parachutes, and 
within the next five 
minutes, all of the 
skydivers will land 
on the Cut.
The best place to 
view the aerial 
events will be on the 
sidewalks by the Cut. Since the 
skydivers will be flying in excess of 25 
miles per hour, it is essential to keep 
the grassy (muddy) part of the cut 
clear for the landings. Binoculars 
would be helpful in getting a better 
view of the formation, but it can also 
be viewed adequately without. Fol
lowing the jump, an informal para
chute packing demonstration will be 
held, and any questions regarding the 
club or skydiving in general can be 
answered by club members.
Friday night, after a long day filled 
with rides and booths and buggy, you
Whether your idea of fun is watching people 
fall from the sky, dress up like a defunct 
band, or juggle babushkas, the variety of 
events happening at Carnival should keep 
everyone entertained this weekend.
would be advised to check out the en
tertainment in the tent.Your initial 
glimpse of the band could cause you to 
do a double-take, especially after you 
hear them play the first song. You 
have to remind yourself that the 
Beatles are all old or dead and this 
cannot be them. It must just be the
mass quantities of cotton candy you 
consumed earlier in the day coming 
back to haunt you. Then you remem
ber hearing about Beatles tribute band 
playing at Carnival.
Eleven years ago, four guys from 
Ohio began 1964: The Tribute, and
----------------------------- since then they
have been per
fecting their 
tribute. Today, 
they are consid
ered the No. 1 
Beatles tribute 
band in the 
world. Members 
wear full cos, _ tumes that rep
licate the 
Beatles look, and use rebuilt instru
ments and amplifiers. The group plays 
music from the Beatles touring years, 
1963-1966.
After the Bosstones do their thing 
on Saturday, Carnival will close with 
some comedy. The first act may seem 
very familiar to many CMU students,
but forget any thoughts you may have e 
about deja vu or out-of-body experi
ence. This is Selected Hilaritys fourth . * 
appearance here in the last three years,' ** 
with their latest performance being afr" 
this years orientation. The comedy .  
sketch group, which focuses most of 
performance on improv, will go on at 8; 
pm.
The second comedian of the night,;, i 
Bob Nelson, may also seem familiar to  : 
many because he has appeared severaK ; 
times on The Tonight Show and in* 
HBO comedy specials. He has also ! 
crossed over into movies, making ap- jj 
pearances in Kindergarten Cop, This-' I 
is My Life, and Brain Donors. TheLong Island natives routine is mainly; j 
character-based, with his football sketch $ 
and Jiffy Jeff boxing sketch consid
ered classics on the comedy circuit. C**

Brain Candy's plot proves 
sweet and senseless
By DAVID ELMAN
Tartan Staffwriter
Every once in a while, a 
movies title actually describes 
its content. Although I cant re
member any other case where 
this is true, Brain Candy is one 
of these. It delivers just what it 
says  some light sweet stuff 
for your brain to digest for an 
hour or two.
]Jdw: Brain Candy 
DNoaHwto: 2ag hdzN[ 
EtT&d[g: \dodTti[w 
\NHwioau
After it was over, it seemed as 
if the movie had lasted only a 
few minutes. While this is usu
ally a good sign in movie mak
ing, here it only signals a lack of 
anything substantial.
Brain Candy's main premise 
is that of a money-crazed phar
maceutical firm desperate for a 
new hit drug. Sales are slump
ing and the companys CEO, 
Don Roritor, is upset.
Naturally, the appropriate 
course of action is to take the 
most promising of the drugs in 
development and market it. As 
it turns out, Dr. Chris Cooper is 
working on an antidepression 
pill which latches onto peoples 
happiest memories. Suddenly, 
it goes from testing to produc
tion, and the craze begins.
Self-described as a social 
i comedy about a mythical drug, 
the film is actually a satire of 
the drug industry. Unfortu
nately, while clearly making its 
point, the movie does nothing 
else.
' Simply put, it is not funny. 
;The only parts which come close 
'fell into the its-funny-becauseits-weird category. Probably 
the best example of this was the 
scene where some kids informed 
their mother of dads where
abouts: Dads upstairs mastur
bating to gay porn again. Is it
funny? Im not quite sure, but 
its definitely odd.
Directing Brain Candy is 
Kelly Makin, who has also di
rected cinematographic delights 
such as National Lampoons 
Senior Trip. He does an ad
equate job with the actors, who 
primarily are the comedy troupe 
The Kids in the Hall.
This is their first film, and it 
fits them perfectly, which it 
should since four of them wrote 
the screenplay. The five of them 
portray over 40 characters in 
the film, and while it makes 
things interesting, it does get a 
little stale after a while. They 
can only get so far on looks 
alone.
These looks vary quite a bit, 
from nerdy scientist to heavy 
metal singer to yes-man to a 
variety of women. In the end, 
however, there are simply too 
many characters.
Instead of showcasing the 
actors abilities to take on mul
tiple personalities, it prevents 
any feelings for them from de
veloping. After a few scenes, 
most disappear forever, aban
doned for other character por
trayals. In this sense, the film 
is a series of skits with a com
mon storyline, true to its heri
tage. Perhaps this was the in
tent; we are not supposed to 
think of the characters, only 
the story. If this is the case, 
then a few more laughs along 
the way would have been ap
propriate.
On the whole, Brain Candy is 
rather disappointing for some
thing eagerly awaited (The 
Kids in the Hall actually 
stopped filming in 1994).
The best parts are incidental, 
such as the music, which in
cludes a faux heavy metal riff 
given voice by a long-haired mu
sician resembling a runaway 
garbage collector. While pleas
ing the eye, this sweet confec
tion leaves nothing behind for 
the brain to savor.
Bands angry music rocks new album
By WILL ISENHOUR
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Killing Joke just released an
other album. For all of you who 
didnt know, Killing Joke is a 
London-based group thats been 
releasing its own brand of hardedged, intensely aggressive mu
sic since 1979. They released 
the Turn To Red EP when I was 
three, and they havent let up
]Jt: 2NN[. tza 
]Jdw: Democracy 
Sdka: Ztt
([waowdN[Ta[w
Their latest effort, Democ
racy, is a departure from their 
highly acclaimed album Pan
demonium, released in 1994. 
Nothing to get all worked up 
about, though. Killing Joke 
was doing the mercurial-thing 
when Madonna was in high 
school.
Just about every band whos 
ever made a name for itself in 
the vocation of aggressive, an
gry music has listed Killing 
Joke as an influence at one 
time or another. Now the 
press-release said that theyre 
the fathers of modern indus
trial, and while I could see 
how that might have some ba
sis in reality, my professional 
opinion says that theyre just 
damn fine musicians. Ill 
credit the roots of the indus
trial movement to some guys 
in Germany whom this review 
is not about.
In this latest iteration, Kill
ing Joke finds a more natural, 
less wired sound. One of my 
favorite tracks off the album, 
Lanterns of Hope features 
an acoustic guitar. Another 
insightful tune, Medicine 
Wheel is a decidedly slower 
tempo than you would expect 
from a band called Killing Joke.
But thrash-fanatics fear not;
tracks like Aeon, Intellect, 
and the final track, Another 
Bloody Election, had me bounc
ing around my room, wildly 
knocking things over and creat
ing even more of a mess than I 
thought was possible. In fact, I 
think I might have sprained my 
neck, but dont tell anyone, 
okay? Im a 
tough guy; 
thats not 
supposed to 
happen to me.
But lastly, 
and most im
portantly, all 
you Killing 
Joke fans out 
there dont 
have much to 
worry about 
either.
Fast or slow, 
hard or soft, 
its all Killing 
Joke, aggres
sive as all hell, 
yet still re
markably di
verse. Democ
racy gives the 
listener a look 
at the band 
from a few dif
ferent sides. I 
think that 
thats one of 
the strengths 
of the album; 
its not all the 
same thing by 
a long shot.
Im always 
disappointed 
to see a good 
band pick one 
song, one 
theme, one 
anything for a
certain album and then repeat it 
on every track. Not everything 
from this latest album is politi
cal; its not all anthems for times 
long past. Actually, if there is 
one song that I would have to
pick to represent the whole al
bum, its Prozac People." The 
song profiles band member Jaz 
Colemans struggle with depres
sion and subsequently with the 
supposed wonder-drug 
Prozac. Sounds a touch cheesy, 
but the song violently crashes 
from a meandering lyric verse,
Killing Jokes new
1995 Zoo Entertainment 
release, Democracy, has an aggrressive style.
to a thunderous 
chorus worthy of Life of Agony.
To make a long story short, you 
cant nail it down.
Another funny thing is that, 
while the album is stripped to 
the bare, bones, they still man
age to produce a borderline 
white noise sound collage. 
Hell, some of it even man
ages to sound vaguely like 
My Bloody Valentine (al
beit played twice as fast). 
More than a few bands from 
the last decade and this one 
have had this annoying ten___ dency to comIpensate for 
total lack of 
talent by 
having an ex
pensive syn
thesizer with 
some cool ef
fects on it. 
Not here. 
Killing Joke 
comes off just 
as well in 
front of the 
effects board 
as they do 
from behind 
it.
Tell you 
what, you 
want my ad
vice? Buy 
this album. 
Im only one 
person, and a 
hard-core 
Killing Joke 
expert I am 
not. But I 
liked Pande
monium, and 
I liked De
mocracy, too. 
Its a colorful 
album in ev
ery sense (I 
wouldnt ad
vise looking 
at the CD too 
long if youre 
on anything 
hallucinogenic) and all ten,- 
tracks hold up pretty well in'*- 
my not so humble opinion. If,-

music, I think youll approve.

advertising of the metaphor can ruin the tale by 
making it predictable. We can figure out Bellers 
message in the story without the large font at 
the top of the page telling us what to look for.
This should not be taken as cutting down the 
book; I thought the stories were good. There are

also has a way of 
stating things that 
makes them seem 
funny and ridicu
lous, and several 
times I found myself 
laughing out loud at 
the sheer goofiness 
of the characters.
Speaking of the 
characters, one of my 
major complaints of 
this book is that 
Beller gives us direct 
insight into the characters thoughts. 
There are often large 
paragraphs consist

reader feel like a 
regular observer as opposed to an omniscient

characters minds. Its rather jarring to break 
away from the action of a scene (which, by the 
way, may be one of the many sexual teases) to 
hear what is going on in the characters head.

Murder. Bribery. Nudity. Prostitution. 
Pecjophilia. Suicides. Rapists. Abortion. 
On PBS? Shattering any myths that 
public television is boring is the mes
merizing Prime Suspect (PBS, Sunday 
i^ay 5, 9-11 pm), the best police drama 
of~t}ie decade.
. At the center of the program is the 
incpmparable Helen Mirren as Detec
tive Superintendent Jane Tennison, a 
dedicated police woman who has fought 
her. way to the top of her profession 
dps.pite many obstacles, including sexual 
discrimination and an unwanted preg
nancy (which was terminated). Along 
the way, she has solved several baffling 
cases, including: a girl who was mur
dered with a belt and then buried under 
a sidewalk, the kidnapping of a baby 
believed to have been sold to a pedophile 
and the burning of a runaway boytumed-prostitute in the home of a trans
vestite.
Prime Suspect is not an easy show to 
watch. The bulk of the characters in a 
single episode (including some police 
officers) are not likable. And, although 
each case is eventually solved, not every 
perpetrator goes to jail. While some view
ers may find the program disturbing, 
they cannot help but admire the bril
liant writing, directing, and acting. In 
addition to Mirren, Suspect has show
cased award-winning performers Ralph 
Fiennes (Schindlers List, Quiz Show) 
and David Thewlis (Naked), as well as 
the exceptional Jill Baker and Beatie 
Edney.
Suspect is nothing short of brilliant. 
Television doesnt get much better.
The American counterpart of this Brit
ish masterpiece is Homicide: Life on the 
Street (NBC, Fridays, 10-11 pm) which, 
like Suspect, possesses one of the most 
electrifying leads in television history. 
Andre Braugher has earned raves for 
his performance as Frank Pembleton, a 
brilliant police officer who, like Tennison,
can crack the most brilliant criminal 
masterminds during an interrogation. 
In fact, Pembleton was once able to con
vince a young man not guilty of a crime 
to confess to it by making him believe 
that his actions lead to the death of a 
friend.
While every Suspect focuses on 
Tennison (as it should), Homicide does 
not always focus on Pembleton. Fortu
nately, Homicide is blessed with one of 
the finest ensembles currently on the air 
(Yaphet Kotto and Melissa Leo are 
standouts among the supporting play
ers), yet episodes that dont involve 
Pembleton just arent as good as those 
that do. Take, for example, the April 5
episode, in which a man was found mui^f | 
dered at a seedy hotel. Braugher did nofr 
even appear in the episode, and the! 
show was rather dull. On the other hand,- 
last Novembers heartbreaking A Dolls i 
Eyes, in which a ten-year-old boy was; 
left brain dead as the result of an acciJ; 
dental shooting, was the best hour <tf; 
television Ive seen all season. (Of coursq, | 
the episode showcased Braugher). Otheft 
recent episodes that are noteworthy in1-!! 
elude the two-part sniper episode, the!

the traveling serial killer story with aii

Likewise, Luminous and 
Watch Down are beautiful in 
their quiet simplicity; Gates can 
convey more emotion in one whis
pered breath than many vocal
ists can in an entire song.
Otherworldly hiss and under
statement do not comprise the 
entire album, however. Strand 
also has plenty of more upbeat 
moments, the best of which is 
Lines and Lines, a song with an 
opening guitar riff that immedi
ately burrows its way deep into 
your subconscious. Lyrically, 
Gates expertly weaves a tale of 
anticipation and longing (Listen 
closely for the tires in the drive

steps in the hallway.) Azure 
and Valency also provide ample 
evidence that Gates and Plouf 
are quite adept at crafting short, 
exciting pop 
songs that 
offer more 
than just a 
pretty voice 
and a beat.

prove that it 
is very pos
sible in contemporary 
music to 
evolve, stay 
true to your 
roots, and 
still make 
great music. 
While many 
bands are 
content to

the same 
creative rut 
for eons, the 
Spinanes 
understand 
that in order to break new ground, 
it is necessary to take risks (some
thing that many artists these 
days seem afraid to do). Strand is 
a big step forward for a band that 
started out ahead of the pack in 
the first place.

wfyen in August of that year, they

of a bassist never becomes an 
issue. Gates bottom-heavy gui
tar tone and the resonance of 
Ploufs drums more than ad
equately pick up the slack on the
low end. Manos, essentially, is a 
quiet, simple record that isnt 
afraid to show its teeth once in a 
while.
Strand is the Spinanes latest 
Sub Pop offering, and it shows 
the band traveling in a new, but 
not terribly surprising, direction. 
Gates and Plouf have begun to 
experiment with instruments 
outside of their traditional gui
tar/drums arena, including piano, 
organ, tympani, and mellotron. 
The addition of these instru
ments, all played by Gates and 
Plouf, give the band a decidedly 
more ambient and ethereal 
sound. In fact, the albums opener,

nearly a minute of what sounds 
like waves rolling and crashing 
against a shore, with Ploufs 
drums thumping lethargically in 
the background. Gates breathy

movies you may have seen before...,
By JOHN BIGGS
Thursday, April 18 
Freaks
Freaks is a movie about freaks. Theres Jo-Jo 
the Dog Face Boy. Theres the dicephalic twins. 
Theres this weird half-woman, half-man freak 
named Lyle Lovett. Theres a bearded lady and 
a short guy. In general, its a real freak show.
Directed by Tod Browning, this is pretty crazy 
stuff. Its a krazy kult klassic that might keep 
you in krackers for a while. The movie is about 
how this evil man wants to take over the freaks. 
So what the freaks do is make him into Jo-Jo 
the Bird Head Girl. Really. Go see this one. Itll 
make you feel good.
At 6, 8, 10 pm, and midnight.
Friday, April 19 
Waiting to Exhale
Waiting to Exhale was a hit when it first came out. 
People were excited. Talk shows were contacted. 
People spent money and went to the theater. Now, 
you too, can experience the magic of Terry 
MacMillians story of African-American women and 
their trials and tribulations.
Critics panned it and praised it. Women and men 
got a kick out of it. There was a lot of music that got 
popular. And, it stars Whitney Houston, Angela 
Basset, and star of Taps and Baby, Gregory Hines.
See this one with someone who is having trouble 
with her boyfriend and gets so annoyed that she 
burns his car.
At 5, 7:30,10 pm, and 12:30 am.
Saturday, April 20 
Clue
Oh boy! This one is a humdinger. See, when it first 
came out, there were three endings: A, B, and C. So 
when you went to the movie, you could see only one 
of the endings! Whatta gimmick!
Starring Tim Curry, Christopher Lloyd, Howard 
Hesseman, and Eileen Brennan, this movie is a 
good effort at bringing the board game, Clue, onto 
the big screen. Seeing as board games usually have 
no plot, motivations, or dialogue, this is a pretty 
impressive effort.
This is a funny movie. Its kind of cute and Im 
sure itll be a lot better after a few whirls in a dryer, 
if you catch my meaning. Itll make you feel clue.
At 6, 8,10 pm, and midnight.

Vegas in Space
Well, this one is ... Good.
Its swell. Theres a lot going on in this one. Im 
assuming that its about space and stuff. Maybe it 
stars Stephen Hawking. I dont know. Ummmm....
Vegas is nice. Theres lights and stuff. And there 
are even slot machines in the airports. So if you 
wanted to go to Vegas without having to stay there, 
you could just sleep in the airport waiting room and 
play Keno and Video Poker. Pretty neat, huh?
Anyway, thats pretty much it.

Foreign film, Antonias Line, impresses critic
ByALEXLEWIN
Tartan Staffwriter
Antonia's Line, the 1995 
Academy Award winner for best 
foreign film, is built upon one 
central conflict: life versus death. 
The film opens with Antonia get
ting out of bed on the day she is 
to die.
What: Antonia's Line 
DNoaHwto: hdoa[a

We then flashback to a young 
Antonia bringing her daughter 
to the village where she grew up 
and where they are to live. Here, 
Antonia is in the prime of her 
life, and as the flashback pro
ceeds, we are constantly aware 
of the contrast between the open
ing scene and all that unfolds in 
the flashback: various forms of 
life, birth, and renewal.
This goes on for some time. In
addition to Antonia and her 
daughter, Danielle, we get to 
know the villagers and experi
ence their joy s. Many years pass, 
and before she knows it, Antonia 
is a grandmother, and then a 
great-grandmother. Along the 
way, many of the people weve
ger, is a miserable hermit, who 
becomes more and more unhappy 
with life as time goes on. Therese 
has always sided with him and 
his philosophies, but when she 
accidentally gets pregnant, she 
has to make a choice. Bring 
new life into the world, or allow

come to know begin to die, and 
much ofthe action takes place in 
the winter, rather than in spring.
The life-death conflict is bril
liantly played out at length in 
the character of Therese, 
Danielles daughter. Therese is 
a genius, able to rattle off mas
sive sums and their square roots 
at the age of six. Her mentor and 
closest companion, Crooked Finit to never exist, which is, ac
cording to Crooked Finger, the 
greatest thing that could hap
pen to a person. The flashback 
structure of this film suggests 
that this whole life and death 
business is cyclical, and that 
maybe the life-death opposition 
is, in fact, not much of an oppo
sition at all  that the two 
have more in common than we
usually consider. When one of 
the villagers dies, Antonia tells 
her great-granddaughter, 
Death doesnt last forever, and 
goes on to describe a Whitmanesque philosophy of rebirth.. 
When we finally come back .to. 
the narrative present, Antonia, 
is on her death bed, surrounded 
by her loved ones. In the middle 
of the sequence, we see a shot of 
what could either be a sunrise 
or a sunset. For a brief mo
ment, we are unsure which it 
is, and in that moment, it seems' 
that it doesnt matter.
Antonias Line is easily one oi 
the best films of 1995, acted, di
rected, and written with complete 
grace and lack of pretension. Its 
message is a new way of looking at 
the cycle of life and death. It doesn.t 
operate on a Forrest Gumpish.attitude of taking the bad with the 
good; in Antonias Line, bad and 
good mold into a greater whole 
and show us the course of hunjan 
life in a way that is profoundly 
true, moving, and optimistic.
New Bad Religion album plays mediocre sounds
By BRADLEY ZIMMERMAN
Tartan Staffwriter
In baseball, if youre batting 
.489 (7for-15,) you are revered 
as a God. If youre a band, par
ticularly punk rock royalty like 
Bad Religion, you have some ex
plaining to do.
]Jt: Ady IaN.Nt[ 
]Jdw: The Gray Race 
Sdka: Rwd[wNH IaHtoyu
On their latest release, The 
Gray Race, Bad Religion seem to 
be undergoing an identity crisis. 
Having lost a principal 
songwriter, founding guitarist 
Brett Guerewitz  favoring to 
run Epitaph Records (BRs former 
indie label)  could understand
ably be the reason for the glut of
filler songs, but when you pick up 
ex-Minor Threat guitarist Brian 
Baker, some slack should be 
picked up. Of the 15 new tracks, 
nine are bearable, and of those, 
only seven are worth giving a 
third listen.
First off, the albums theme is 
one of racial harmony and social 
tolerance delivered in BRs trade
mark academic sneer. The cover 
art and inlay card, though it prob
ably looked like a good idea from 
afar, is a mathematical layering 
of portraits of people with mixed 
heritages laid side by side. In 
short, there is no one cover and 
the text/lyric sheet becomes use
less and ugly.
Musically, vocalist GregGraffin 
continues to use that Cornell Ph.D 
of his to weave more mind-teasing verbose concoctions (dire 
perpetuation and incongruous
insistence...  from Them and 
Us) but he doesnt seem too ex
cited, and often tries to croon  
which he fails miserably at. 
Graffin, he of the cocked eyebrow 
and pointed finger  now the 
bands primary songwriter  has 
created an album where you can 
actually picture which of their pre
vious releases the good songs from 
The Gray Race should be on. In 
fact, the only truly new direction 
that BR chases on this album with
out creating a train-wreck is the 
melodic thrash and background 
voices on Parallel. Probably the 
best track on the album, the afore
mentioned Them and Us, with 
its multi-syllabic lyrics, breakneck 
speed, and complex vocal harmo
nies, probably would have been an 
outstanding track on their 1989 
hardcore landmark No Control 
album. Strangely, even the two
obvious radio-play tunes, A Walk 
and Punk Rock Song are catchy, 
enough to forgive them for their; 
commerciality.
However, these bright moments 
are overshadowed by eight othr 
songs which are so uninspired and 
meandering that I dont even want 
to mention them by name out of 
fear that theyll haunt me the next 
time I try to sleep. Lets just say 
that if The Gray Race was an EP, 
I would have felt better about 
plunking down the 12 bucks I did' 
for it.
Bad Religion is still better than 
any so-called punk band you hear 
on the radio these days, but they 
seem to be having a personality 
crisis. Do yourself a big favor anjl 
tape the songs you like off of some
one who already owns this Ct),

Diabolique remake falls short of previous version
By ALEX LEWIN
Tartan Staffwriter
John Huston once said, Only 
successful pictures are made over 
again; Ive never understood why. 
Unsuccessful pictures ... are the 
ones that should be given a sec
ond chance. Never was there a 
better example to illustrate this 
than the recent re-make of Henri 
Georges-Clouzots 1954 thriller 
Diabolique.

Te original is a great movie, 
still genuinely suspenseful and 
terrifying. But the new version, 
directed by Jeremiah Chechik 
CBenny & Joon), crams the sus
pense down our throat. Every 
time a plot twist or an act of 
violence occurs, it is accompa
nied by an loud, overbearing bit 
of Randy Edelmans gloomy score, 
and photographed with some 
elaborate, nauseating camera 
movement.
Isabelle Adjani stars as Mia, 
an abused wife who plots with 
her lover Nicole (Sharon Stone) 
to kill Mias husband, Guy (Chazz 
Palminteri). They manage to pull 
off the murder, in an intermi
nable and overly violent scene, 
but then Mia becomes racked with
guilt as signs that Guy might still 
be alive keep popping up.
The main problem with this 
film is that sex and violence are 
its gimmick. It seems to exist 
simply for those reasons. There is 
not a compelling character on the 
screen. The original film, on the 
other hand, had a 
story to tell about 
a tormented 
woman who finds 
herself at the 
breaking point 
and is persuaded 
by her friend to 
take desperate ac
tion. The violence 
was a necessary 
part of the story.
Here, its just 
thrown in for 
glamour.
Adjani and 
Stone are both to
tally dry, though 
one must have some sympathy 
for them, as they are at the mercy 
of a lousy screenplay by Single 
White Female writer Don Roos. 
Neither character seems to know 
what she wants, so neither ac
tress can make a final decision on 
the matter. The Palminteri char
acter is even worse: a one-dimen
sional, violent, cheating husband.
The entire film feels labored. 
Movements seem unnatural, con
versation feels forced, and Mia, 
in her frazzled terror, keeps mak
ing the same mistakes over and
over again, and Nicole must con
tinually cover up for her stupid
ity.
To the films credit, there are 
some lovely shots of Pittsburgh. 
The only Pittsburghers we see, 
however, are a couple of annoy
ing, empty-headed hillbilly-type
Three Rivers area!
Leaving the theatre, I could 
not help but wonder about the 
tendency in Hollywood to ie-' 
make great films. Why not-te-' 
make a bad film if it has a decent 
story? That way, you have noth
ing to lose and people wont be 
constantly compare 
ing your version*tp 
the old one. John 
Hustons first film, 
for example, was 
The Maltese Fal
con. In 1941, it was 
the third filmed adaptation of the 
Dashiell Hammett 
novel of the same 
name, and the ofrty 
one of the three 
thats any good1.
