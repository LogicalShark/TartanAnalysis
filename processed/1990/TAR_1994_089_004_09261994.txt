Greek life gets new advisor
By HEATHER ZINDLE
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Due to the increasing involvement of fraternity 
and sorority leaders over the past few years, a new 
full-time Greek advisor position was created this 
year in the Residence Life Office. The former 
Greek advisor, Pat Hamed, worked in the Office of 
Student Affairs, and thus only had 50 percent of 
her time to dedicate to the advising and adminis
trative tasks.
There was also the problem of the advisor oper
ating out of the student affairs office. There has 
historically been a sense that the student affairs 
office was tough on fraternities, said Michael 
Murphy, dean of Student Affairs, The advantage 
of having this person report within Residence Life 
was the added continuity in the relationship with 
the residence houses and the orientation program.
Tim Foster, Assistant Director of Housing and 
Residence Life, agreed, stating that the new posi
tion creates a mentor for the Greek system who can 
draw from the resources in Residence Life. It would 
also allow the Greek system to be viewed as a 
residential community. Janine Coppola, a new 
member of the Carnegie Mellon community, as
sumed the new position in July.
Coppola, who is a native of upstate New York, 
graduated in 1991 from the State University of 
New York at Binghimton, and received her master 
of arts degree with a focus on Greek affairs this 
year from Bowling Green University.She is a mem
ber of Alpha Phi womens fraternity, in which she 
held many leadership positions. These roles of 
leadership within her own sorority first made her 
interested in the type of position she now holds.
She worked as a field consultant for Alpha Phi
after receiving her bachelors degree, which al
lowed her to travel around the country. Coppola 
gained more experience by working in the Greek 
life office at Bowling Green.
Coppola thinks the Greek system is very strong, 
solid, and has a great history at Carnegie Mellon, 
and dispels any rumors that there are plans to 
phase out the Greek system on campus.
Murphy affirms this. There is a growing empha
sis in the fraternities and sororities on leadership 
development and community involvement. 
Coppola states her new position would not have 
been created if this were not the case.
Coppola meets regularly with the officers of 
Interfraternity Council and Panhel, the respective 
governing bodies of the fraternities and sororities 
and addresses concerns as they come up, or as I 
see them.
She also works with Greek Council which brings 
the fraternities and sororities together. It is a 
forum to discuss and plan philanthropic events, 
such as the blood drive and Greek Sing. I believe 
greek life and fraternity and sorority membership 
goes beyond social aspects, for there are many 
educational aspects within each chapter.
Right now, she is busy helping to plan the Greek 
Retreat which will be held in October. It is a chance 
for fraternity and sorority members to learn more 
aspects of leadership.
Members can get more out of the system with 
some leadership roles, although she understands 
offices are not right for everyone.
Murphy thinks the new arrangemeiit has worked 
out well. Janine Coppola is cl6arly an individual of 
great talent and commitment. The fraternity and 
sorority leaders now and in the years to come will 
benefit from her support.

The Student Alumni Rela
tions Committee (SARC) has 
received $2500 to help fund a 
student/alumni picnic to be 
held during Homecoming. The 
money comes from the Special 
^locations Fee that is com
prised of money from the Stu|dent Activities Fee.
Student Government Presi
dent Declan McCullagh said 
hat Shelly Brosnick, the SARC 
advisor, originally came to him 
jrequesting that he provide 
|$5,200 of the funding for the picnic. 
According to McCullagh, it was cus;omary in the past that the President 
give funds from his personal account 
: towards the picnic. However,
McCullagh said that he and ex-President Dave Wolpert agreed in a meeting 
last year that funding the event is not 
the best use for the Activities Fee. 
Because of the expected cuts,
Emma Gosden, Student Govern
ment treasurer, expects that the funds 
received in Senate from the Activities 
Fee, will be less than usual this year. 
She estimates an allowance of about

Escort shuttle

Tartan Assistant News Editor
On Friday, September 23 at 9:20 pm, 
a CMU escort van was involved in a 
head-on collision with another car at the 
corner of Centre Ave. and Devonshire. 
The escort driver, Natacha Hutchinson, 
a sophomore industrial management 
major, screamed over the radio, Oh my 
God, help Centre Avenue. As Campus 
Police identified the call, Pittsburgh 
Police were already dispatching cars to 
the area.
Four CMU officers arrived at the scene 
to find various City Police, Fire Depart
ment, and Medics. The van was hit by a 
Ford Taurus. The two passengers in the 
van, as well as the driver, appeared 
okay, as they were standing outside on 
the sidewalk when police arrived. The 
driver and passenger of the Taurus were 
still inside the car, unconscious, and 
were being attended to by Pittsburgh
Medics.
The accident caused Hutchinson to hit 
her head on the steering wheel. She 
suffered a bloody nose, cut lip, and had 
swelling to her left knee. She was then 
transported to Presbyterian Emergency 
Room. The two passengers in the van, 
Andrew Beckwith,a Ph. D math stu
dent, a student, and Michael Solow, a 
staff member suffered minor injuries. 
Beckwith, who was sitting in the front 
seat, stated he was not hurt in the acci
dent because he put his hands in front of 
his face before he hit the dashboard. 
Solow was seated in the second row of 
the van and had a minor laceration on 
his right elbow. Solow refused a trans
port to the hospital but was checked on 
the scene by Medics.
The persons in the Ford Taurus, a 
man and a woman who have no affilia
tion with CMU, were assisted out of 
their car by Medics and immediately

[On Thursday in the new 
Jorewood Faculty Dining Room, 
idents met to discuss the pos
sible future of Scotland Yard, also 
Bywn as the Yard. 
fScotland Yard was a coffee 
imse/restaurant/hangout which 
as located in Skibo. However, 
e to the demise of Skibo, the 
yard has been left homeless. A 
foup of students, led by Student 
)vernment President Declan 
[cCullagh, were unwilling to let 
le Yard die, so they have been 
lobbying for a new location.
| A planning meeting was held 
[ on September 19 to' decide what 
|ould be addressed at the genmeeting.
!The main points agreed upon
for discussion were the location 
of the Yard, the menu, and the 
hours of operation. On Thursday 
night, the Faculty Dining Room 
was filled to capacity with stu
dents. The meeting was run by 
McCullagh and Director of Din
ing Services Roger Heydt.
However, the feelings of the 
students were so strong that it 
was difficult to keep order. At 
one point, a shouting match de
veloped over whether the Yard 
would be smoking or nonsmok
ing. There were several new sites 
proposed. The informal vote taken 
at the meeting indicated that the 
Morewood dining room was the 
preferred site. The preferred 
hours of operation were approxi
mately 5 pm to 2 am.. A large 
contingent of students wanted 
later hours, but several former
Scotland Yard employees pointed 
out that late hours would take 
their toll on the staff. The stu
dents indicated that they wanted 
the menu to stay as it was last 
year for the most part. Desserts 
will be offered on a rotatingbasis, 
with the exception of Chocolate 
Death Cake, which was guaran
teed by Roger Heydt.
Students were concerned over 
the atmosphere. Features such 
as a Scotland Yard Decorating 
Party, real glasses, and bar stools 
were proposed, among other sug
gestions. Some students sug
gested that the name of the Yard 
be changed to Not the Yard, but 
several people commented No 
matter what its called, well still 
call it the Yard.
During the meeting, students 
were given polls to make individiial comments on what they 
waited out of the Y ard. At press
time, 91 students had filled out a 
survey form and preliminary re
ports state that no one wanted 
the Yard to close at midnight, 49 
said they wanted it to close at two 
while 39 wanted it closed between 
three and four in the morning.
The majority wanted to have 
the YardinMorewoodas opposed 
to only two who wanted it in the 
Student Center.
McCullagh felt that the meet
ing was very beneficial. I was 
pleased by the turnout, he said 
after the meeting.
He believes that Dining Ser
vices will listen to the student 
input at the meeting, and stu
dents will have the kind of Scot
land Yard that they want.

Judicial Board to 
review crime
. WASHINGTON, September 
22, (I)J)  Are prior accusa
tions against rape suspects evi
dence that they are likely to 
commit such crimes? Congress 
thinks so, hut some federal 
judges are opposing a new law 
that would allow jurors to con
sider such arguments.
The measure, part of the 
crime bill signed by President 
Clinton this month, allowB ac
cusations of previous similar 
crimes to be introduced as evi
dence in sexual-assault and 
child-molestation cases.
But before the measure goes 
into effect, the Judicial Confer
ence of the U.S. will get a chance 
to review it, and already some 
members are saying they, dont 
like it.
The judicial, conference, which 
is the policy making arm of the 
U.S. courts, reviews new laws 
affecting rules of evidence.
Some members of the confer
ence think that a jury should 
consider only whether a defen
dant committed the particular 
crime at hand, rather than ad
ditional accusations meant to 
show a likelihood to commit, such 
crimes.
Itisnt yet clear what changes 
will be proposed by the judicial 
conference, whose members in
clude the chief judges of the 
federal appeals courts, some
district judges and Supreme 
Court Chief Justice William
H. Rehnquist.The conference 
must make its recommenda
tions by February. Congress, 
however, doesnt have to pay 
attention to the proposals. If 
Congress doesnt act within five 
months of the judges recom
mendations, the original mea
sure becomes law as is.
Currently, juries in federal 
courts can consider prior accu
sations against a suspect in 
certaineireurnstances, but they 
cant be asked to conclude that 
it indicates alikelihood to com
mit a crime. Supporters of the 
measure note that rape and 
molestation victims often dont 
press charges against their as
sailants, so prior convictions 
simply may not exist in many 
cases.
Proponents sy the measure 
makes it less likely that  
sexual-assault trial will un
fairly turn on the credibility of 
the accuser.
Even though the majority of 
rape and sex-abuse trials are 
brought in state courts  
rather than in federal, courts, 
where the new law applies  
the debate is important be
cause many state-court sys
tems use the same rules of evi
dence that govern the federal 
judiciary.
Nine Haitians 
killed in melee
By EDWARD HAYES
Acting Tartan News Editor
HAITI Sept. 24 - Nine Hai
tians were shot and killed Satur
day during a gun fight with U.S. 
Marines at a police station in the 
northern coastal city.
It is unclear whether the dead 
me were members of Haitis 
police. According to U.S. officials, 
the incident began when five gun 
shots were heard in the station 
and Marines responded. One Ma
rine on the scene stated that four 
people came from behind the desk
armed and firing their weapons. 
Lieutenant Colonel Steve 
Hartley said the initial shots 
were fired after words were 
passed between the Haitians and 
the Marines who were just across 
the street. The U.S. military said 
they would keep a close eye on 
the station, after there have been 
reports about members of the 
Haitian police beating civilians.
The United States also told the 
Haitian military commander, 
Lieutenant Colonel Claude 
Josephat, that such action would 
not be tolerated.

WASHINGTON, September 23 
(DJ)  Baseballs antitrust ex
emption came under fire in con
gressional hearings, but for now 
its repeal remains unlikely. The 
current chances are slim and 
none, said Rep. Jim Bunning, a 
Kentucky Republican, repeal pro
ponent, and former major league 
pitcher. Congress has only two 
weeks left before adjournment 
and too many pressing matters 
before it. He said, But if the 
strike is still going in January, 
there will be some very strong 
momentum to do something about 
the exemption. Indeed, House 
Judiciary Committee Chairmiin 
Jack Brooks, (D. Texas), declared 
his support for repeal, for the 
first time, blaming the lords of 
baseball with their deep pock
ets and hard heads for scuttling 
the World Series for the first time 
in 90 years. A Judiciary subcom
mittee conducted the hearing. 
Donald Fehr, the players union 
chief and a witness, renewed his 
call for repeal of the antitrust 
exemption, enjoyed by the own
ers since 1922. Among other 
things, it limits players ability to 
legally fight the owners if they 
unilaterally impose a salary cap 
and other changes in baseballs 
labor structure. Such stars as Jeff 
Bagwell, David Cone and Jack
McDowell also traversed Capitol 
Hill yesterday, lobbying for re
peal with their leading Senate 
champion, Sen.Howard 
Metzenbaum. The Ohio Demo
crat still hopes to slip a repeal 
amendment into some unrelated 
legislation before the Senate ad
journs. If I get a chance, you can 
bet your sweet life Ill try it, he 
said. Sen. Metzenbaum earlier 
was unable to get his own version 
of repeal through the Senate Ju
diciary Committee, which in June 
killed his bill by a 10-7 vote. Rep. 
Brooks said he would push for 
quick action in the House if Sen. 
Metzenbaum succeeded in the 
Senate this time around, but 
doubted repeal would come up 
before adjournment.

WASHINGTON, September 23 
(DJ)A government attorney is 
taking issue with a charge made 
by Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, dur
ing last summers hearings on 
the Whitewater controversy. 
Leach, the ranking Republican 
on the House Banking Commit
tee, contended that Glion Curtis, 
while serving as acting general 
counsel of the Resolution Trust 
Corp. in the fall of 1993, was 
party to an attempt to delay the 
criminal referrals that named 
President Clinton and First Lady 
Hillary Rodham Clinton as wit
nesses to wrongdoing involving 
the Whitewater real-estate deal 
and Madison Guaranty Savings 
and Loan, the failed Arkansas 
thrift. Leach suggested the effort 
involved senior administration 
officials, including former Trea
sury general counsel Jean 
Hanson. In a letter sent to the 
committee after the hearings, 
Curtis, who came to Washington 
from the RTCs regional office, 
asked for an opportunity to cor
rect the record. Curtis is now an 
attorney for the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corp. A spokesman for 
Leach said the congressman has 
not changed his views on the 
matter.

WASHINGTON, September

Leader George Mitchell, DMaine, wont make any announce
ment today concerning the fu

Although comprehensive re
form is considered all but dead 
this year, an aide to Mitchell said 
he is still conferring with sena
tors to determine what support 
exists for any health-care reform 
measure. The aide added that no 
announcement is expected this 
weekend, either.
Earlier this week, Mitchell said 
he would decide by today whether 
he would continue to pursue talks 
with the so-called Mainstream 
Coalition, a bipartisan group of 
Senate moderates that called for 
higher cigarette taxes and cuts in 
Medicare and Medicaid to pro

Mitchell has met frequently 
with mainstream leader Sen. 
John Chafee, R-R. I. ,i;o try to meld

the negotiations between the two 
sides are going well.

He noted the Republicans need

I think we can do it, Dole said

He later said hes willing to'

Funding allotted 
for homecoming
PICNIC, tom page 1
convince Senate to override fis
cal policy to [fund this event]. 
Article six, Section 24 of the 
bylaws states that Senate can
not fund food or travel for any 
organization. It also states that, 
in order to override this policy, 
advance notice of one week 
must be provided by the orga
nization requesting anovenide. 
Alumni Relations has pro
vided the necessary notice, and 
Gosden said I think Senate 
will look favorably on [SARCs] 
willingness to raise funds.' 
However, she also said that this 
is a big question and that Sen
ate will need to decide if this is 
top priority ... considering our 
lack of funds.
Although, the money is com
ing out of the Student Activi
ties Fee, it is going directly to
wards the student portion of 
the picnic, and after that the 
$2,500 covers only half of that 
cost. When Alumni register by 
mail for Homecoming they are 
paying a fee that covers their 
portion ofthe picnic. The money 
that is coming from Senate di
rectly subsidizes the student 
food portion. The picnic is held 
on the cut, and with a student 
ID students will be provided 
with a ticket that lets them go 
through the food line.
When the Senate voted on 
the allocation, it was passed 
with only one objection. Martin 
Dixon, a junior electrical engi
neering major, raised his objec
tions before the vote. Dixon said 
1 think if its going to be a 
Homecoming event sponsored 
by Alumni Relations it should
not be funded by the Student 
Activities Fee. SARCs mission 
is to create situations where 
students and alumni can inter
act, said Steven Calvert, As
sistant Vice President for De
velopment and Alumni Rela
tions. Last year it is estimated 
that 1200 students attended to 
the picnic.
The Special Allocations Fund 
exists for things that have not 
been budgeted for. After stu
dent organizations have pro
duced their budgets andmoney 
is put into a reserve fund for 
emergencies, the Allocations 
Fund is created for the year. 
McCullagh noted that he cut a 
good portion of his budget this 
year. Part of the cut was due to 
the reduction of need for these 
funds, and part went towards 
granting the Student Govern
ment Treasurer an account. 
Currently, McCullaghs budget: 
consists of about $2,634 (down 
from $6,800), the Treasurers 
account is about $1,500, and 
Senates expense account is 
about $6,550.
Paula DeGioia, the associate 
director of Alumni Relations 
and also this years Homecomi ng Chair said one of things she 
is addressing are feelings that 
Homecoming is no fun for stu
dents.
This year she looked into 
more activities that both stu
dents and alum ni could partici
pate in together because she 
said its 'important [to have] 
some fun events for students. 
Alumni Relations hopes they 
can provide a good environment 
for students.

Carnegie Mellon University 
and a variety of business leaders 
are joining forces to build a stateof- the-art office on top of Marga
ret Morrison Carnegie Hall. The 
new wing is tentatively sched
uled to open sometime next year.
the long North-South wing of 
Margaret Morrison that runs 
parallel with the tennis courts. 
The new office, known as The 
IntelligentWorkplace. will serve 
as a research and teaching facil
ity as well as a working office for 
faculty students and staff of the 
Center for Building Performance
and Diagnostics (CBPD), part of 
the Department of Architecture.
The new facility will be used as 
an experimental project to test 
new technology in areas of en
ergy efficiency, building system 
integration and even reusable 
building components.
Were in a time when technol
ogy changes rapidly, said Steve 
Lee, administrative director of 
CBPD, We want to test and de
velop technologies developed by 
others.
The plan to build the Intelli
gent Workplace is not a new idea, 
Weve wanted to build it for some 
time, said Paul Tellers, the Uni
versity Architect. The original 
design of the structure was con
ceived by Pierre Zoelly an alumni 
of CMU. who does his work in 
Switzerland.
We needed a local architect to 
complete the design and collabo
rate with him and [write up] con
struction documents, said Tell
ers.
CMU hired Bohlin Cywinski 
Jackson to assist in finishing the 
project.
As it stands now, the project is 
ready to go, but according to Tell
ers, There is still some concern 
about funding.
Aunique feature about the new 
facility will be the ability of each 
member to alter the conditions 
around them. According to Lee, 
each desk,will have a personal 
unit that will alter lighting, noise, 
heat and air conditioning.
The Intelligent Workplace can 
be easily changed due to a num
ber of factors.
The tiles in the floor come up
with little effort and the compo
nents that control the elements 
in the building can be moved with
out the use of electrician or other 
such professionals.
Lee stated that the cost of the 
new state-of-the art equipment 
does exceed the cost of modernday equipment in the short run.
But, in the long run the cost of 
maintaining the area will de
crease.
There have already been plans 
to prepare for the new facility. 
We have already stiffened the 
structure of the building to carry 
the additional load, said Tellers.
He added that the work that 
was performed on the building 
last year was just a restoration.
The construction will take place 
in two phases. The first phase 
will begin as soon as the funding 
is dealt with and will consist of 
the building of the outer struc
ture.
Phase two will commence in 
the summer when more money is 
made available and will be the 
actual furnishing of the facility.
Tellers commented that he was 
really concerned about how the 
construction would disrupt stu
dents working in Margaret 
Morrison.
We are trying to work out the 
details if there is going to be times 
of the day when [there has to be 
quiet] he said.
Phase one will begin this year 
and by next year students in the 
architecture department will 
have an opportunity to work in 
the office of the future. An office 
that will combine comfort with 
conservation.

CMU ranks 24th in country
Harvard takes number one for fifth year in a row
By EDWARD HAYES
Acting Tartan News Editor
The magazine, U.S. News and World Report 
released their annual Americas Best Colleges is
sue September 19 and announced that Carnegie 
Mellon University ranked number 24th in the 
nation for the second year in a row out of 229 
national universities.
Some of the facts reported in U.S. News were 
discouraging. CMU has only a 72 percent gradua
tion rate. Those who graduate do not appear to care 
very much for their alma mater with only a 31 
percent giving rate from its Alumni.
The faculty scored high with 93 percent having 
doctorates. The student/faculty ratio was reported 
to be 9:1. Of the freshman class, 60 percent of them 
were in the top 10 percent of their high school class 
and the average midpoint combined SAT score was 
1245.
To rate the colleges and universities accurately, 
U.S. News conducted a survey of officials at over
1,400 four-year colleges and universities. The 
schools are divided into categories that are based 
on classifications organized by the Carnegie Foun
dation for the Advancement of Teaching.
The categories are: national universities, na
tional liberal arts colleges, regional colleges and 
universities, regional liberal arts colleges and spe
cialized institutions.
Some of the major factors that contributed to 
schools rankings were student selectivity, faculty 
resources, financial resources, graduation rate and 
alumni satisfaction.
Harvard University was ranked number one for 
the fifth consecutive year while Princeton, Yale, 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and 
Stanford completed the top five.
Amherst College was ranked the number one 
liberal arts college. In the regional rankings, 
Villanova was number one in the North, the Uni
versity of Richmond in the South, Valparaiso Uni
versity in the Midwest and Trinity University for 
the West.

Next time your friend insists on driving drunk, do whatever it takes

Hard worker joins 
CMU Career Center
By BRIAN FREDRICKSON
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Joseph Schewe is the new interim 
director for the Career Resource Cen
ter. The position was vacated when 
the previous director, Denny Ryan left, 
in December of 1993.
Schewe took on the position in midSeptember and went right to work. 
During a Career'Center open house, 
Schewe greeted people at the door, 
helped with the information desk and 
filled in where needed. He is sched
uled to remain until June 95, . but
ipes to remain longer.
Schewe has lived in Pittsburgh all 
his life. He received his bachelor of 
business administration and masters 
in personnel administration from the 
University of Pittsburgh, where he 
also did his postmasters studies. From 
Pitt he went to the United States Army, 
where he served for four years in the 
Finance and Adjunct General Corps. 
He went on to workfor PPG Industries 
for 43 years until he came to CMU.
From about 1973 he worked on re
cruiting college graduates for employ
ment opportunities within PPG. This 
experience has given him a wide knowl
edge of how the job market works and 
has produced personal ties to many 
employers. HeworkedatCMUbriefly 
as an acting associate director and
placement counselor in 1993, so he 
already had a feel and a respect for 
CMU.
Karen Litzinger, associate director 
of the Career Center, feels that he is a 
strong presence who both respects 
the knowledge and experience of the 
Career Center staff as well as brings 
in his own expertise.
He works hard for the students, as 
Litzinger discovered when he was the 
Acting Associate Director. He really 
threw himself into his work. When 
asked what he felt he could add to the 
Career Center, Schewe said that his 
knowledge of what the employer is 
looking for will aid him in helping 
graduating students find the right 
path that leads to success. He also 
hopes to attract many companies to 
CMU to find talented and skilled 
employees. Schewe feels that it is im
portant to keep both the students and 
the employers in mind when working 
in an area such as the Career Center. 
Constant dialogue, which is needed to 
allow both sides to come to an agree
ment, is one of Schewes goals. He 
combines the qualities of the business 
world and the CMU community into a 
philosophy that could assist students 
in being successful. Schewe is in for 
an exciting year, with programs like 
Resume Expert a plan that gives stu
dents abilities in creating resumes.
Shuttle accident injures three

transported to the hospital. The couple 
was found unconscious at the scene and 
at this time, the driver, whose identity is 
still unconfirmed, is listed in critical 
condition. The passenger, who identi
fied herself as Lynn Gidel is said to have 
a broken hip. Hutchinson, as well as 
several witnesses said the accident was 
being caused by the Taurus. Hutchinson 
said that she had just made a left turn on 
to Centre off of Morewood.
She was on her way to Melwood for her
first drop off. At Centre and Devonshire, 
she saw a vehicle with its high beams on. 
The vehicle crossed the center line and 
hit the van head on. Beckwith confirmed 
the description and added that the Tau
rus had sped up to beat the light at 
Centre and Millvale when it veered into 
the vans lane.
One eyewitness said that after the 
Taurus went through the light, the driver 
appeared to doze off which caused him to 
veer into the oncoming traffic.
A second witness said the Taurus was
going at a high speed and did not stop 
at the light. The accident is still under 
investigation and a cause has not yet 
been found. Commenting on the 
driver, Sergeant Richard Sima of Cam
pus Police said, His veins were fried. 
Drugs or alcohol have not been iden
tified as the cause of the accident. 
Both vehicles involved in the accident 
were taken to the City Pound by Pitts
burgh Police. Hutchinson has been 
released from the hospital and escort 
services is dealing with the accident.
Tartan Almanac

Professor Charles Pearson, a graduate 
of Carnegie Tech and member of the 
C.I.T Music Department faculty since 
1924, is now Acting Head of the Music 
Department. He fills the vacancy cre
ated when Dr. J. Vick OBrien, founder 
of the department in 1912 and its head 
for 32 years reached the retirement age 
this summer.
15 Years Ago - The wiring problems 
in the new Margaret Morrison Apart
ments have been corrected, reported

Tartan that both toggle switches and 
base plugs were inspected.
10 Years Ago - According to the Tar
tan, Thirteen CMU Student Senate 
members and Advisor, Dr. Ed Lilley, 
Assistant to the Dean in charge of spe
cial projects, participated in a Student 
Senate Retreat in September. Lilley ad
vised and coordinated the event and 
designed the program/workshop to ex
pose and create leadership skills.
5 Years Ago - Carnegie Mellon stu
dents who live near Dithridge Street, a 
known gay cruising area claim, they are 
being harassed., reported the Tartan, 
Members of CMUs Gay and Lesbian 
Allies tried to play down the incident by 
claiming the incident was merely a mis
understanding.
Correction
Barbara Lazarus is the Associate 
Provost in the last issue of The Tar
tan, in the article entitled, CMU 
joins Phi Beta Kappa honors frater
nity we incorrectly reported that 
Lazarus was a Professor in the his
tory department.
Lazarus, however, is connected 
with the history department but is 
not a professor for them. We apolo
gize to Ms Lazarus for the misinfor
mation.
The Tartan corrects all known er
rors of fact. If you know of an error,

FORUM
Special allocation fund 
not meant for picnics
This year, part of the tab for 
the annual Homecoming Picnic 
will be picked up by Senates 
Special Allocations Fund, which 
consists of money from the Ac
tivities Fee. Originally, the pic
nic was funded by the Student 
Government Presidents Fund, 
which is also derived from the 
Student Activities Fee. How
ever, Declan McCullagh, the 
current Student-Body Presi
dent, recognized the inherent 
problems of funding such an 
event from the Activities Fee. 
Therefore, he eliminated the 
funding. Unfortunately, $2500 
will be provided for the picnic 
from our Activities Fee$2500 
dollars which could feasibly fund 
five new student organizations.
Should the Activities Fee be 
used for funding the annual 
homecoming picnic? Although 
students can attend and associ
ate with the alumni, the picnic 
exists mainly for the benefit of 
alumni in conj unction with their 
other homecoming activities. 
Most likely, students will merely 
attend for the free food. Of 
course, all 7,000 students that 
contribute to the fee could not 
eat at the picnic. So, if 1,200 
students wanted a little extra 
cash for lunch, would Student 
Senate fund them? Since Sen
ate by-laws state that the Ac
tivities Fee cannot be used for 
food, Senate should deny such a
request. Apparently, the home
coming picnic is an exception to 
the original purpose of the Stu
dent Activities Fee, or perhaps 
larger funding requests are 
never turned down by Senate.
Considering that organiza
tional funding and budget space 
have decreased, why fund this 
picnic? The Student Activities 
Fee should be used more appro
priately. The Activities Fee is 
designed for student events and 
organizations. Since this event 
is being put on by the Student 
Alumni Relations Council 
(SARC), they should foot the 
bill. It seems that SARC should 
pay for the entire event.
Funding for the Homecoming 
Picnic should not come from the 
Activities Fee. Considering that 
students are not the main ben
eficiary of this activity, funding 
for student activities is rela
tively low, and the Activities 
Fee is not designed for purchases 
of food, Student Senate has in
correctly continued the practice 
of funding the picnic with our 
Activities Fee.
In the future, Senate guide
lines for the use of the Activities 
Fee should be clarified and fol
lowed. The Activities Fee should 
be used to enrich student life on 
campus and provide memorable 
experiences, not to fund a large 
food service picnic on the Mall 
for alumni.
Shuttle service better, 
but problems persist
CMU students have finally 
moved up in the world. Now, 
everyone can get home no mat
ter where they live in the area 
by riding the newly merged Pitt/ 
CMU shuttle. At last the two 
universities have combined 
shuttle services to provide a 
larger service area and a more 
efficient transportation system. 
Besides providing a useful set of 
benefits for Carnegie Mellon and 
University of Pittsburgh stu
dents, this merger could prove 
to be a good source of social 
interaction between the two uni
versities. The system does have 
problems, but this is a good first 
step.
The current written rule is 
that any CMU student may ride 
the Pitt shuttle on weekdays 
after 7 pm and at any time on 
the weekend. According to stu
dents who have taken advan
tage of the merger, the unoffi
cial rule is that students may 
ride at any time as long as they 
show an ID. Now on weekends 
when the CMU A and B shuttle 
routes are combined and run in 
a small cramped bus, we can 
instead ride larger buses that 
cover an even more extensive 
route. Before, CMU students 
could not ride the shuttle to get 
to Squirrel Hill; now they can 
take the spacious, air-condi
tioned Pitt shuttle there as well 
as to many other areas previ
ously not covered by the CMU 
shuttle alone.
The shuttle system here at 
CMU has been notorious for its 
painfully slow service and the 
limited area serviced. This 
merger is providing abetter ser
vice for everyone involved and 
should be maintained at all 
costs. If it ever comes to the 
point where Pitt can no longer 
afford to support CMU in the 
merger, we should provide the 
funds necessary to help support 
the system. If it ever comes up 
that CMU Yes! have the money 
to buy another shuttle, this 
money should be used to help 
maintain the merger in hopes of 
keeping the broad area of ser
vice that this program provides. 
CMU students do not live only 
in the area serviced by the CMU 
shuttle. They also live in areas 
which are only accessed by the 
Pitt shuttle. These students 
should not be left to their own 
devices to find a way home late 
at night. They should also have 
the benefits of a safe ride home 
provided by a university shuttle.
Now that weve sung the 
praises ofthis merger, we should 
point out that there is a prob
lem. The Pitt shuttles are often 
overcrowded and some CMU 
students are left stranded. If 
this continues, Pitt may see fit 
to end this partnership. CMU 
should come up with any money 
necessary to improve the shuttle 
services and keep this partner
ship going.
Carnegie Mellon should not 
try to compete with the Univer
sity of Pittsburgh in the area of 
transportation services. We 
should try to maintain the 
merger and the keep up the new 
relationship. In the future, it 
might be possible to branch out 
into other areas while keeping 
communications going between 
the two universities.
Shuttle leaves riders cold
k J Jason Togye
Ever been passed up by a bus?
Its extremely frustrating, especially 
when it happens late at night, or when 
youre in a hurry to get somewhere. And 
while its bad enough when the Port 
Authority does it to you, its entirely 
obnoxious when youre ignored by the 
much-ballyhooed, new cooperative 
Carnegie Mellon/University of Pitts
burgh shuttle service. But thats exactly 
whats happening, says Ben Frank, a 
chemistry graduate student.
I havent been able to get on [Pitts 
Squirrel Hill shuttle], says 
Frank. More often than not, 
its quite full, and the driver 
just wont stop for us. On 
September 13, for example,
Frank says that he was 
passed on Forbes Avenue not 
once, but twice, at 8 and 8:30 
pm. Four other people were   
waiting at 8:30 as the bus 
zoomed by.
To solve the overcrowding problem, 
Carnegie Mellons Department of Secu
rity (a.k.a. Campus Police) placed new 
restrictions on the use of Pitts buses by 
members of the CMU community. Stu
dents have been told that theyre not 
allowed to ride the Pitt shuttles before 7 
pm on weekdays because of overcrowd
ing.
He says that Pitt apparently isnt run
ning any extra shuttles after 7 pm to 
pick up the overflow. Normally, such 
busses come five to 10 minutes after an 
overcrowded shuttle, but Frank has 
waited patiently, only to see... nothing.
We cant ride it during certain hours, 
and when we can ride it, we cant ride it, 
says Frank. This was supposed to fix 
the lack of a Squirrel Hill shuttle. In 
reality, he says, its been of absolutely no 
use to him. Three times [this semester] 
Ive been passed up, he says. Ive man
aged to ride zero times.
For the last few years, CMU students 
have been clamoring for a Squirrel Hill 
shuttle. Officially, there was nothing 
they could do. Unofficially, though, 
theyve been riding Pitts shuttles for 
some time. Neither university wanted 
to publicize this fact because they feared 
CMU riders would swamp Pitts system. 
Well, guess what?
One wonders how fast the now spirit of 
cooperation between Pitts Parking and

Transportation Department and CMU 
Campus Police will evaporate once Pitt 
realizes that its getting nothing out of says. In the meantime, hes still waiting
I hate to make an awful pun, but there 
really isnt such a thing as a free ride. 
The University of Pittsburghs existing 
shuttle service obviously is unable to 
handle the increased load that CMU 
students place on it, and it is unreason
able to expect Pitt to expand its service 
without receiving some sort of compen
sation.
Frank finally complained to the news
paper after phone calls and email to 
Campus Police went unanswered. There 
were two articles on how gre at the shuttle 
service was, [but] I keep getting blown 
off, he says.
Is the much-flaunted shuttle, experi
ment merely an attempt to placate stu
dents? The University can pat itself on 
the back and talk about how traveling at
--------------- night has been made easier
for students, but nothing has 
changed. We still need i

Both universities are cur
rently collecting ridership 
data to evaluate the 
experiments results. Frank 
would like someone to con
duct a different experiment. 
Id like someone to sit there all day and 
see how many people get passed up, he
the experiment. Nothing but a big head
ache, that is.
And what happens this winter as the 
days begin to get shorter? For their own 
safety, students are routinely advised 
not to walk to Squirrel Hill after dark. 
When night begins to fall at 6:30 or 7 pm, 
should students wait for a shuttle that 
they wont be allowed to board, or should 
they risk the hike?
Every reason that they gave for insti
tuting [the experiment] was blown 
apart, Frank says.
for his response from Campus Police. I 
hope it arrives before the CMU Squirrel 
Hill shuttle.
P.S.: Theres sort of a happy ending to 
all of this. A few hours after I spoke to 
Frank, a Pitt shuttle actually stopped 
and picked him up! Go figure. And it 
only took five weeks!

CMDS should pursue profit first
Ronak singhal
With the closing of Skibo, a new cafeteria has been opened 
in Morewood Gardens and it looks like Scotland Yard is 
about to move into Morewood as well. As the changes were 
being discussed last semester, it seemed that students 
would be offered a greater choice of higher-quality, reason
ably priced food. Yet the quality of the food served by 
Carnegie Mellon Dining Services this semester has not 
changed, and the price structure is far from reasonable. It 
has also been revealed that CMDS is losing money. Maybe 
its time CMU got out of the dining services business and 
allowed private companies to come in and serve food.
Currently, CMDS operates several eating areas, the most 
popular being the Highlander Cafe in Resnik Hall and the 
Morewood Gardens Cafeteria. If either one of these were 
opened up to outside companies, a very nice food court could 
be developed, containing several different food companies 
franchises. Such a set-up would greatly increase the day-today variety for students and offer food at a competitive price.
Even if only one of the cafeterias were to be privatized, the 
other would remain operational and under the supervision 
of CMDS. However, the formation of a food court would 
probably result in a much higher quality of food and lower 
prices than the cafeteria operated by the school. This would 
simply be because of the competition that would ensue 
between the various food purveyors.
By allowing partial privatization, the school would also 
cure the current problem of CMDS debt, for CMDS would no 
longer be operating both cafeterias and would cut costs. 
Then, one cafeteria area would be leased out to private 
companies, which would produce revenue for the school. So
another result of privatization is that the current state of debt 
could be turned into a revenue-producing scheme.
The ironic thing about the current situation is that it seems 
that many students want CMDS to spend more money and 
take on more responsibility on campus. The greatest example 
of this, of course, is Scotland Yard. Many students have 
complained that the new Scotland Yard will only serve a 
limited menu and will only be open for a short amount of time 
each day. Our Student Government president, Declan 
McCullagh, has even stated in a leaflet that students should 
not give CMDS a reason to save money.
This attitude is absurd. CMDS is currently losing money, 
and its past record shows that students are unhappy with the 
quality of food they receive. Yet now were asking them fr 
more. Having a limited Scotland Yard is a good fiscal decision 
by CMDS. They are sure of having a good customer base, a 
with a limited menu and limited hours, costs will be contained 
This kind of spirit should be embodied in every project that 
CMDS undertakes.
Of course, having Scotland Yard run by the school i 
against the idea of privatization, but there is no need for a total

Conformity quiets calls for change
Yatt Ball
Are there many people who like change? 
Growing up, we are taught to act in a 
certain way, believe a certain dogma, and 
pursue a certain path. Many here at CMU 
here as a part of the American Dream 
get a good education to get a good job to 
a good salary, success, security. Speak
ing our minds, deviating from the norm, 
seeming strange, or offending others only 
seem to serve to push us away from these 
)als.
Growing up, I was taught to play the 
game: to regurgitate what my teachers 
wanted, to smile and be quiet. I followed 
the straight and narrow  honor roll, 
scholarships, sports letter, a practical, 
promising majorwith only a few typical 
rebellions thrown in (an unapproved girl
friend, not going to church). I was the 
cookie-cutter All-American.
Then McClintock ruined it all.
Fred McClintock was my roommate 
freshman year, a 21-year-old transfer who 
was not your typical college student. He 
didnt express his angst by wearing black 
or cutting/coloring his hair for shock value. 
Neither did he judge his life by his girl
friend, his car, his profs opinion, or how 
wasted he was last weekend. He did, how
ever, have an open mind and the strength 
and ability to act differently, according to 
his honest, unrationalized assessment of 
the world.
Fred McClintock was a vegetarian.
At first, I ignored him. Then I tried to 
distance myself from him, saying how ex
treme, unimportant, or difficult vegetari
anism was. I liked going out to a nice 
restaurant or grabbing a quick burger 
when busy. This was how I had lived and 
how the people around me lived. Fred 
couldlive how he wanted, but I just wanted 
him to leave me alone 
 its a free 
world,
reward of the good life, was now re
vealed to me as a bloody chunk of car
cass, an unconsciously and callously 
carved corpse.
Yet while I came to understand this, I 
fought against its implications, which 
struck me initially as unbearable. I was 
a good person. I liked animals and 
would never inflict pain on them. Yet 
Fred would play the 
Smiths, and 
Morrissey 
would
But it 
wasnt all 
right. I was un

with 
simple, un
deniable logic on Meat 
is Murder, Its death for
in my grades, my jobs, my paycheck, my 
pals.
I was no longer shrouded by the blind 
bliss of ignorance, and I knew that the 
meat I ate was the flesh of another animal, 
a being who wanted to live, a life I had paid 
someone to end in the horrors of the slaugh
terhouse. This piece of juicy meat, which I 
had always believed to be the symbol and
no reason, and death for no reason is 
murder.
What could I do? My head knew that 
this was true, and my heart was re
pulsed at the thought of factory farms 
and slaughterhouses. Meat is murder, 
and it is wrong. Yet my traditions  
everything I had been taught to believe 
and to honor  said that eating meat 
animals  was okay, unquestioningly ac
cepted and inherently good. To listen to my 
own thoughts and decide for myself would 
be to reject the central celebration of meat 
by my friends and family, for I knew that 
once I accepted the cruelty and cut meat 
from my diet, as per Kants moral impera
tive, it would not be okay to be around 
others and remain silent, as if nothing 
were amiss, as if nothing had changed.
To this day, I dread discussing vegetari
anism. Since I met Fred eight years ago, I 
have seen factory farms and been to slaugh
terhouses; the screams of these animals 
stay with me every day. It is worst when I 
am faced with someone who reacts as I 
reacted to Frednot wanting to hear, not 
wantingto question, not wantingto change. 
The agonies of the animals, living and 
dying hidden from our eyes and ears, their 
corpses disguised and exalted on our plates, 
struggle against my sympathy for the per
son confronted and my desire to avoid judg
ment.
While I try to be moderate and reason
able, I know that eating meat is not a 
matter of choice any more than slavery or 
child abuse is a matter of choice. It is the 
exploitation and murder of fellow sentient 
beings who feel pain and who fight to stay 
alive.
In the face of this injustice and suffering, 
of what compulsion is conformity?

Fraternities dont deserve lousy reputation
James stepanek
Why does everyone and their 
cousin seem to hate fraternities? 
I know: they throw loud parties, 
harbor some underage drinking 
(where doesnt that happ en?), and 
occasionally pull some pranks, 
but they also teach responsibil
ity, provide a social outlet and 
perform charitable good works. 
They are a uniquely North Ameri
can institution which has tradi
tionally been a cornerstone of 
university life.
Some people are going to claim 
that the parties are a ruckus. 
Maybe (when the parties get go
ing well), but the fraternities are 
self-policing. They also have in
surance which covers liability, 
and require brothers to be mem
bers of a sober patrol. In recent 
years at CMU, keg parties have 
come to be allowed in the dorms. 
These parties are probably not 
managed with half the account
ability and responsibility of the 
fraternity parties. There is no
insurance for these events, and if 
one thrown with the tacit ap
proval of an RA results in a trag
edy, both the RAs life and the 
affairs of the University are very 
likely to be in dire circumstances.
Many rankle at the fact that 
fraternities are exclusionary. 
Well, so is my personal circle of 
friends; does that mean Im dis
criminatory? Besides, the social 
aspects of fraternities are not com
pletely exclusionary with respect 
to non-members. Parties have 
guest lists. There are a number of 
Greek-sponsored events which 
are extremely popular to the cam
pus community. Would Spring 
Carnival be the same without the 
Greeks? (No  Spirit would win 
every year.) Look at Greek Sing; 
this is a campus event which is 
enjoyed by a large number of 
people and is of great benefit to 
charity.
The fraternity stereotype of a 
drunken, right-wing stooge is 
utter nonsense. Fraternities are 
a place where people who get 
along well can interact and form 
close friendships. Fraternities 
produce friendships that last. 
They harbor some of the best 
times of your college career. Not
all of the people drink. The views 
are not homogeneous. The atti
tude is not standard. To join a 
fraternity, one is not sacrificing 
ones individuality; one is simply 
picking an environment in which 
he has a say about where hes
to trouble yourself? Just look at 
the homecoming schedule. 
Theres a happy hour set up spe
cifically for Greek alumni. Im 
not going to say that in order to 
remember CMU well you have to 
have been in a fraternity, but it
going and what hes doing.
To underscore my point about 
the lasting friendships and re
membered good times from fra
ternities, just ask the University 
who gives more as alumni, Greeks 
or non-Greeks. Theyll tell you 
the Greeks, by a wide margin (a 
grudging reply.) You dont want
s'Pc 2tvvnkNt'vtV e'vPnv
sure helps. Of course, the way 
CMU is treating fraternities these 
days, that wellspring of goodwill 
is drying up fast. Im hoping that 
CMU will wake up and under
stand what the consequences of 
its actions are likely to be. Earn
ing the ire of the Greek alumni is 
likely to be fiscally unwise.
Fraternities offer opportunities 
to learn responsibility and even 
management skills. Those who 
accept offices in their houses can 
learn how to deal with organizing 
budgets and managing the ac
tivities of a number of people. 
Just being in a fraternity forces 
you to improve your abilities to 
meetnewpeople and interact with 
a large number of those who you 
will have to live with.
My best friends are all from my 
fraternity. I graduated a couple 
of years ago, but I still keep in 
touch with a large number of these 
people (brothers and little sis
ters.) They share memories of the 
times we had  good and bad  
and somehow I find that other 
people just cant understand me 
quite so well. If it werent for the 
close bonds we had in the frater
nity, a lot of us probably wouldnt 
have made it through the two 
funerals we had to endure during 
my time in the house. No, you 
cant just write off fraternities as 
places for parties. Theres a whole 
lot more than that.

Welfare system deserves real reform
Brian Fredrickson
We all know that the current 
welfare system is not perfect, and 
I wouldnt think of insinuating 
that it is close. The debate goes 
on and on about what exactly the 
problems are. Some feel that wel
fare recipients receive too much 
aid.
To me, the main problem is not 
that benefits are increased based 
on the number of children. The 
system does not do enough to get 
the recipients off the system and 
out there supporting themselves. 
It is said that most people finally 
do leave welfare and return to
the system. We should encourage 
this is by training welfare recipi
ents for jobs that are secure and 
pay a reasonable amount, for this 
is the only cure to the welfare 
problems of this country.
It was stated in a former issue 
of The Tartan [Welfare reform 
starts with attitude, 9/12] that 
increasing a recipients benefits 
because of the addition of a new 
child only encourages mothers to 
have more children.
While this is undoubtedly true 
in some cases, we cannot gener
alize it for all. Many women (and 
men) just want to have more chil
dren. It is certainly within their 
rights to have more children if 
they desire to do so, but those 
children have the right to a bet
ter life  a life free of crime, 
drugs, and poverty.
For this to become a reality, the support a family without proper 
parents must get off the system job training, 
and into a good job. They need to For this reason, the current

the ticket.
Yet welfare recipients are just 
not encouraged to get the proper 
education that would allow them 
to get off the system for good. We 
all know that jobs are scarce right 
now. It is almost impossible to 
come by a job that pays enough to
be allowed to remain on welfare 
for one year. This would discour
age those who would rather live 
off the system. The only excep

emergencies and those who were 
going to school and passing their 
classes. These people would need
some additional help to get back 
on their feet.
Second, the system should en
courage recipients to go to back to 
school. The government could do 
a few things to make this a pos
sibility. It could offer no-interest 
loans to pay for tuition, or work 
out a program by which recipi
ents could go to certain educa
tional facilities for a reduced cost, 
or even free.
All of this would not be a total 
hand-out, however. Those people 
in school would have to constantly 
maintain passing grades or they 
could be taken off the system. 
They would also have to pay back 
this help, in addition to any bills 
they create, with required com
munity service.
Welfare is one ofthe major prob
lems in our society today. The
system has been given a bad repu
tation when actually it is trying 
to do a vital job in the best way it 
knows how.
The only way to help the sys
tem is through welfare reform. 
These reforms need to help people 
get themselves off the system and 
into the outside world. In todays 
society, this can only be accom
plished through providing edu
cation.
Hopefully this would allow the 
children of these parents to stay 
off the welfare system as well, 
because most children who grow 
up on the system will remain on 
it. It is our governments job to 
change the system to benefit these 
people, not trap them for life.

Saturday the Tartans opened

lulled, away in the second half to 
their third game of the year 
,y a score of 31-7. This win ex
ended the Tartans overall record 
3-1 while the Eagles dropped 
1-2.
However, the game was not as

Offensively, 
the Tartans 
kicked it into gear with about 10 
minutes left in the first half. This 
is when the Tartan ground game 
went to work on Juniata. After 
five rushing plays, the Tartans

However, after Juniata scored on

take the early lead, it was the 
Tartan defense that rose to the 
occasion. Carnegie Mellons de

The Tartans got the ball to start 
the second half, but at the end of 
a 20-yard run, senior fullback 
Jason Grusky coughed the ball 
up to Juniata at midfield. Seven 
plays later, the Eagles found 
themselves in a fourth and 14 
situation at the Carnegie Mellon 
21 yard line. Instead of trying a 
field goal, the Eagles went for the 
first down, but the defense 
stopped the drive. The Tartan 
offense again gave the ball back 
to Juniata, however, on an inter
ception by Eagle comerback Kyle 
Sweitzer. But the defense again 
stopped Juniata. And then after 
a bad punt, the Tartans drove to 
the Juniata eight yard line where 
Dee threw his first touchdown 
pass of the game to Mathias to 
extend the Tartan lead to 24-7.
The fourth quarter saw one 
more Tartan score set up by a 
junior Robert Locke interception 
at the Carnegie Mellon 42 yard 
line. Three plays later, Dee com
pleted a 46-yard pass to his tight 
end, Neal, and then hit Mathias 
for a 28-yard touchdown strike. 
After the game, Locke said that 
the defense came up big a couple 
of times just as they had last 
week against Rhodes. He also said 
that Juniata was a really tough 
and physical team, which may 
explain the Tartans slow start.

Both the Mens and Womens cross 
country teams are off to strong starts 
this year. The mens team has outrun all 
of its Division III opponents so far, and 
the womens team has had two runners

The Mens team is performing well in

said mens coach Gary Meckley. We 
lave a very young team. They are run
ning inconsistently.
However, the team has been perform
ing very well in its first few meets. The 
Tartans opened with a home loss to 
California University of Pennsylvania. 
We were a little discouraged, but since 
;hen, we discovered that California prob
ably has the best Division II team in the 
-area, said Meckley. They next week, 
the team finished second in the Califor
nia Invitational, but they were the top 
Division III team.
I dont think weve ever lost to a Divi
sion III team in any of the invitationals 
Weve gone to for nearly the last 20 
ears, said Meckley. We beat a numIer of teams that were Division II that 
ormally we wouldnt beat.
Last week, the Tartans finished fifth 
gut of 20 teams in the Indiana InvitaSfv n.a^ '^Sain, they were the number one 
division III team. The Tartans outran 
several Division II schools again, in
cluding Slippery Rock.
That was a big bonus for us, said
sophomore Ron Polcawich.
The team is enthusiastic about the 
remainder of the season. Our top five is 
a lot closer than it was last year. 
Everythings really shaping up, said 
Polcawich. Junior Matt Beam has been

Josh Greynolds, and Polcawich round 
out the top five.
The UAA championship meet should 
be very interesting next month.
I think Rochester is going to win it,
the leader for the Tartans.
Beam has been our number one man. 
Hes been in the top ten in all the 
invitationals weve gone to, said 
Meckley. We also have some guys from 
last year who have really improved. 
Sophomore Sebastian Ziesler is one of 
those who have really turned it on this
but there are probably going to be six 
teams of equal ability, said Meckley. 
Dependingon howthose teams develop, 
and depending on what teams are 
healthiest at that time, I think that will 
determine the finish.

Tartan rushing attack with 76

fourth quarter. Lackner later told 
me that nothing was wrong with 
Grusky, but that instead they 
wanted to rest their big fullback 
and give junior backup Lee Anton 
a chance to play. Neal led the 
Tartans in receiving yardage with 
87 yards on four catches.
The Tartans feel pretty good 
about the rest of the season. Many 
players feel that the Tartans goal 
is to finish with a 9-1 record and 
go to the Division III playoffs. If 
the Tartans can advance to the 
playoffs it will be the first time in 
four years that the team has been 
in postseason play.

Hockey fans can wheel and deal with NHL 95
0y ERIC STRAUSS
fartan Sports Editor
When NHL 95 comes out on October 1, 
twill be the latest in EASports yearly 
updates oftheir successful sports games, 
however, this version of the gamethe 
fourthadds some features unheard of 
in any of the companys titles, as well as 
totally revamps the graphics.
The general style of game play is the 
same as in NHL Hockey 94 and NHLPA 
Hockey 93, the games previous two in
carnations (Ive never seen the original 
0L Hockey game). This game has the 
1993-94 season rosters, and the players
3, shoot, and play defense with the 
same controls as they did in the other
realistic, if a little more difficult to pick 
up.
But, if the play is approximately the 
same as in past years, then the graphics 
are totally different. Player animation 
is much, much smoother, making play
ers moves actually look fairly real. In
their hand at leading a team through all 
84 games, and into the playoffs, instead 
of just through the playoffs as in past 
years. There is an autoplay feature to 
skip the games that arent worth play
ing or to save time. The league season is 
complete with award winners and league
[The instruction manual] has the barest instruc
tions, leaving game players to fend for themselves 
on many screens. Experienced players may have 
some trouble, and rookies may not have a clue ...
Of course, EASports motto is if its in 
the game, its in the game, and NHL 95 
follows the recent trend of defense, de
fense, and more defense in the real live 
NHL. Improved goaltending, defensive 
play (including the defensemens ability 
to get down and block shots) makes 
scoring a real challenge. The easy 
breakaway moves from previous games 
completely stoned in this version, 
and its harder to get shots off against 
quicker players, even with the new abil
ity to fake shots. However, overall, the 
game play is faster, smoother, and more
addition, the ice surface is redone  it 
actually looks like ice, with varying 
shades of blue giving it a realistic shim
mer  and the face-off screen and 
scoreboard are totally new.
The most radical change, however, is 
the added general manager functions. 
Now players can be created and added to 
rosters. Players can be released into a 
free agent pool, and signed from that 
pool. And, most importantly, trades from 
one team to another can now be pro
posed  and the game includes an arbi
trator to decide if the deal is fair.
The other major change to the game is 
the league season. Players can now try
leaders.
Unfortunately, the game has some 
problems that were not evident in previ
ous versions. The biggest flaw is in the 
documentation. The manual for this 
game is skimpier than the manual for 
prior versions, which detailed every 
single command in the game. This book
let has the barest instructions, leaving 
game players to fend for themselves on 
many screens. Experienced players may 
have some trouble, and rookies may not 
have a clue what some screens are for.
Another major flaw is in the roster 
sheet included with the game. In the 
past, the last 30 pages of the manual
were dedicated to rosters, but in this 
game a small poster with the rosters is 
included. While the color is nice, many 
vital features, such as an overall team 
rating and team strengths and weak
nesses, are not on the roster, just the 
players and their positions, uniform
--------------------- numbers, and ratings.
This may seem trivial at 
first, but if youre playing 
Calgary versus Chicago, 
and you want to know 
which team is better over
all, youll have to add up 
all 25 'players totals on 
each team, and then average them.
If you bother, let me know what they 
are. I dont have an hour to punch num
bers into a calculator because EASports 
was too lazy to do it.
A couple of little features present in 
NHL Hockey 94 are missing in NHL 95. 
One is the player cards, which kept 
individual records for all the NHLers in 
the game.
Another feature is that the ability to 
save lines is limited to teams playing in 
the playoffs or regular season. And of 
course, fighting has been gone from the 
game since NHLPA Hockey 93 (along 
with the its in the game voice at the 
title screen), because anything licensed
by the National Hockey League cannot 
contain any fighting.
One other irritation is that you cant 
skip the title screen until most of the 
credits, including the licensing agree
ment, have rolled past.
Another major problem is with the 
general manager functions, a flaw that 
should definitely corrected in future edi
tions: once trades are made or players 
are added, there is no reset to default 
rosters type of command. If you make a 
trade, you make a trade. You can always 
reverse the deal, but it will affect the 
teams lines and roster order perma
nently.
NHL 95's biggest flaw is that EASports 
has gone for style over substance. If 
youve played other EASports hockey 
games in the past, figuring things out in 
NHL 95 is a little like trying to use a 
Macintosh without an instruction 
manualits not that difficult to begin, 
and you get the hang of the features 
after a while.
On the other hand, if NHL 95 is your 
first purchase, trying to learn the game 
from the documentation will be like try
ing to stop a Wayne Gretzky breakaway
 every-things a blur, and then its too 
late.
Youve made a good game, EASports. 
Next time, send a real manual.
Mens tennis team combines youth and experience
By MATTHEW SOLITRO
Tartan Assistant Sports Editor
The mens varsity tennis team is off to 
strong start this year. They have three 
wins in their first five matches, and they 
are very pleased about the way they are 
playing. They are enthusiastic about 
the season and are loaded with a new 
batch of young players.
We are much more positive than last 
year, said senior Mike Macedonia. The 
freshmen are very promising.
The Tartans opened up their season 
on a high note with a 6-3 win over West 
^Liberty State College.
The team then traveled to Allegheny, 
where they lost 63.
The loss to Allegheny was really dis
appointing, said Maced-onia. We 
played extremely poorly.
The next day, the Tartans had a doubleheader against Gannon University and 
Mercyhurst College.
The Tartans blew out Gannon 7-0, 
but then lost to Mercyhurst 5-2.
The Tartans won their latest match 8 
1 against Washington & Jefferson.
We are improving as the year goes 
on, said Macedonia. Were still trying 
to gel a little bit, especially in doubles.
This coming weekend, the team will 
be traveling to Swarthmore College for 
the Rolex Small College Championships.
The Tartans will then finish out the 
season with matches against Catholic 
Unversity and Case Western Reserve 
University in early October.
Case is a big match, said Macedonia. 
 We are looking to avenge last years 
loss.
The top seven players are almost all 
freshmen and seniors. According to 
Macedonia, Were blending new people 
with experience.
John Muza, a fourth-year player who 
is a graduate student, is the Tartans top 
player. He was one of the team leaders
during the 1993-94 fall and spring sea
sons.
Three talented freshmen, Jim Freeze, 
Dan Bilco, and Nazrose Marshall are 
amongst the top five players for the 
team.
Macedonia, another top returnee, is 
the Tartans number four player.
The only sophomore in the top seven is 
Vijay Nayak. Senior Bill Mathey is the 
teams doubles specialist  one of the 
players who should help they younger 
players.
The match against Case Western will 
be the teams last one this semester.
They will then resume play this spring. 
Were looking to get stronger for the 
spring, said Macedonia.
The spring season is much longer for 
the men, but will feature matchups 
against some of the same teams. The 
highlight of the spring will be the an
nual trip to Hilton Head, South Caro
lina.

DONT MISS THIS! IT JUST MIGHT SAVE YOUR LIFE!
Debbie Gardner, America's #1 
Crime Fighter, is speaking this 
Wednesday, September 28, at 8:30 
pm in the William Pitt Union Assem
bly Room. Admission and refresh
ments are free for CMU students. 
Don't miss this important one-night 
personal self-defense seminar!
(Meet in the second floor lounge 
area of Cyert Hall at 8 pm to walk 
down to the William Pitt Union in a 
group.)
After hundreds of hours of inten
sive physical training, just weeks 
before graduation from the police 
academy, Debbie Gardner was as
saulted walking to her car by a man 
with a gun. Too scared to fight, she 
froze. This humiliating defeat oc
curred despite perfect grades at the 
police academy, including police 
self-defense courses.
As a result of this emotional event, 
Debbie decided to develop the Per
sonal Protection Seminar to help 
others deal emotionally, physically, 
and mentally when confronted with 
a similar situation.
Debbie's dynamic and no-nonsense 
approach to personal protection
has brought her national recogni
tion. She was acknowledged as 
"America's #1 Crimefighter" in the 
premier issue of Crime Fight maga
zine. Vogue magazine published a 
feature on Debbie. She's appeared 
on the Sally Jesse Raphael Show and 
The Morning Show in New York. 
Debbie has presented seminars for 
employees at organizations includ
ing Proctor and Gamble, AT&T, 
American Airlines, the FBI, IRS, and 
Blue Cross and Blue Shield. She's 
spoken to students at major univer
sities across the country and is a 
member of the National Speakers 
Association. Now she's coming to 
Pittsburgh!
"Let go of the guilt... There are 
times when rules don't fit! Being 
alone, talking to strangers, being 
unaware of your surroundings, etc. 
are all reasonable choices we all 
make...all the time! It's about free
dom, but let's admit freedom does 
not mean 'risk free.'"
"You need realistic tools to survive 
violence and feel good about your 
need for safe mobility!"
-Debbie Gardner

Quarterback Sneak
by John Weber year. Let them play!
gets close to a receiver. Hey, I 
dont mind a defensive battle 
every once in a while, so let the 
defense do their job. Finally, I 
think the NFL should stop 
changing rules as often as they 
do. Some people might actually 
be turned off at the way rules 
seem to change from year to
Last week, comerback Dion 
Sanders (you can call him 
Prime'Tame) was sighed to a 
one-year deal by the team I 
think is going to represent the 
NFC in the Saper Howl. the 
San Francisco 49ers. I felt the 
49ers were the team to win it 
all before Sanders, and I certainlyfeelthatwaynow.:Sometimes too-many stars on ateam 
creates ego problems that can 
actually hurt a teamnot the 
case here. Sanders will awaken 
the 49ers defense that for years 
had the goal of just allowing 
fewer points than Montana or 
Young could score. Now; with 
Sanders speed and skill in the
49. l'jumffiMi 
sill have an offensive elc-mcmt 
it has never had. And who 
knows, the defense may actu
ally win agame for the 19ers at 
some point this year, imagine 
that. (The thought of covering 
Jerry Rice. John Taylor, Brent 
Jones, and Sanders gives op
posing secondaries problems, 
too.)
Now lets address some ofihe
the NFL so much this year. Its 
nice to have the two-point con
version, but Im not too sure 
that I like some of these new 
kicking rules. Its enough to 
move the kickoff back to the 30 
yard line, but theres no reason 
to requirekickers to kick from 
a one-inch tee also. Just about 
every kicker in the NFL was 
kicking from a three-inch tee 
last year, so why do they have 
to kick from a one-inch tee and 
move the kickoff back five, 
yards? One or the other would 
be sufficient. The rule about 
the placement of the ball after 
a missed field goal isnt going to 
do much. One NFL coach said 
that if he thought his wasnt 
going to make a field goal he 
wont kick the field; goal, let 
alone worry about the spot of 
the ball after the Idcfc Finally, 
f dont like how often the offi
cials have been calling defen
sive interference. The league 
lias cracked down on interfer
ence in an attempt to increase 
scoring, and officials are call
ing it every time a defender
Last week was not a good 
week for me at all. With only 
two of five correct, my season 
record goes to an even 5-5. But 
in my defense,, the NFL has 
had its share of surprises thus 
far. The Chargers and 
Seahawks : are playing much 
better than expected, while the 
Broncos, Saints, and Cardinals 
are showingthe rest of the NFL 
just how horrible they really 
are. Lets just hope that Buddy 
RyahdoesnE start pnnchihgout 
his assistant coaches if 
Arizonas losingstreak contin
ues.
John Weber's Top Five 
Picks for Week 4
1. Houston at Pittsburgh 
(Monday Night)
Youcancheckme on this, but 
I do believe Cowher is unde
feated on Monday Night Foot
ball, Expect the Steeiers to ex
tend his unbeaten streak. 
Steeiers 29-20.
2. DaUas at Washington
This one: will be closer than
most: expect. The Redskins al
ways put up a good fight in 
RFK. Cowboys 20-15.
3. N.Y. Jets at Cleveland
Defense! The defense will re
turn to the Jets game plan at 
the expense ofVinny (I thought 
we were wearing green, coach) 
Testaverde. Jets 20-10.
4. Buffalo at Chicago
The Bills dont play well on
grass, but the Bears defense 
has not had many good games 
this year,: despite head coach 
Dave Wannstedt. This should 
actually be a close, exciting 
game. Bills 24-20.
5. Philadelphia at San 
Francisco
This matchup produced an 
exciting game atthe end of last 
year; expect nothing less than 
the same this year. 49ers 35- 
34.

engineering major.
Women runners hope to improve

end, said Polcawich. If they do, 
the Tartans could finish near the 
top of the conference.
The womens team has also 
been running very well so far this 
season. This is probably the best 
team Ive had since we finished 
second in the UAA back in 1989, 
said coach Dario Donatelli. The 
front runners this year are sopho
more Becky Buchheit and junior 
Melissa Bautert. Both of them 
have received UAA Athlete of the
Week honors this season.
Junior Sangita Jinwala is also 
running really well. She got in a 
really good summer, said 
Donatelli. The main difference 
has been the fact that Ive got a 
couple of freshmen, Beckey 
Barbisch and Melissa Lott, who 
are my fourth and fifth runners. 
Theyre keeping pretty close.
We have a lot of great, enthu
siastic freshmen, said Jinwala. 
It adds a lot of spirit to our team. 
Everyone is getting really close
so were getting very supportive. 
The team opened the season up 
with a win against California 
University of Pennsylvania. The 
next week, they finished second 
at the California Invitational.
Slippery Rock, an excellent Di
vision II team, was the only team 
that outran the Tartans. Last 
week, the team finished fifth at 
the Indiana Invitational.
The only Division III team that 
beat us was Baldwin-Wallace, 
and theyve got an excellent Divi
sion III team right now, said 
Donatelli. They are... better than 
any team well see in the UAA.
For the next month, this young 
team will be trying to get more of 
its runners in shape  gaining 
valuable experience for the UAA 
Championships next month.
Im hoping for the top three or 
four in the UAA, said Donatelli. 
With the way theyre running, 
and if they improve the way L 
think, who knows what we can 
do?
Womens soccer keeps improving
By ANUJ GUPTA
Tartan Staffwriter 
& ERIC STRAUSS
Tartan Sports Editor
This past Saturday, the 
Carnegie Mellon womens soc
cer team continued what has 
been a successful season, possi
bly even on the way to the 
NCAA tournament.
The host Tartans defeated 
Hiram College by a one sided 
score of 5-0, bringing the teams 
record to 411. Although jun
ior Nicole Poisson and sopho
more Alyssa Newman carried 
the offensive load with three 
and two goals apiece, respec
tively, it was a total team effort 
as five different teammates had 
assists. Poisson now has seven 
goals on the season to lead the 
team.
Goalkeeping duty was also a 
team effort as sophomores Jill 
Weber and Katherine Morrison, 
and freshman Kendra McCoy 
all split time in goal  the 
latter two getting their first 
action of the yearwhile pick
ing up the teams fourth shut
out of the season.
Yesterday, however, the Tar
tans could not stop Wittenburg 
University, losing 62 in a 
tough overtime contest.
Earlier in the week, Weber 
was named UAA Athelte of the 
Week for womens soccer for 
the second consecutive week. 
Before the Hiram game, she 
had three shutouts and a scin
tillating 0.43 goals-against av
erage.
The team hosts Seton Hill 
College on Wednesday and 
takes on Emory University at 
home next Sunday.
In last weeks rankings, the 
Tartans moved up to eighth in 
the Great Lakes Region. Ten of 
the 60 teams in the region are 
ranked, with the top four ad
vancing to the playoffs. This 
weeks rank will be posted Tues
day.

You walked with few

inspiration became woman

Spinning
dizzy with incense 
the church
so full you'd have thought it was Easter Sunday
An accident on East Carson
emptied our souls
leaving a nauseous hunger
that we hoped the communion would fill
but standing there
by the coffin
we nearly choked on the white wafers.
The priests vestments were
a movie screen
onto which I projected
bloody pictures of the car
crushed like a pop can around her head
1 squeezed my eyes shut
like a four-year-old at a horror flick,
drawing tears at the corners of eyes
too numb to cry.
Mortality
rode on the breeze that snapped 
the black flags of the funeral procession 
17 was no longer an age of 
invincibility.

Years later CMU retention rate remains low
By ALLIE KING
Tartan Asst. Features Co-Editor
On February 4,1986, The Tartan fea
tured an article on the extremely low 
retention rate at CMU [Are more stu
dents failing out?, 2/4/86]. That year, it 
was reported as a general statistic that 
an average of20-25 percent of students
that entered CMU as freshmen did not 
graduate. Brad Walters, the Dean of 
Student Affairs at the time, was quoted 
by The Tartan in reference to the issue: 
It is my understanding that our attri
tion rate is low for the academic rigors of 
CMU.
The article suggested that the reason 
for such a low retention rate was that 
the admissions standards were much 
lower than the actual expectancies of 
the school.
Gabrfen dygDVnkNt'vtV e'vPnv
Seven years later, although many 
changes have occurred, CMU is still 
known as having one of the lowest stu
dent retention rates of the countrys top 
universities. Detailed information as to 
the retention rate over the past two 
years, the percentage of returning fresh
men, for instance, was not available 
from the administration. According to 
the Carnegie Mellon Facts Book, 1994, a 
total of 1,189 freshmen applicants were 
enrolled in 1989.
Their graduating class, the class of 
1992, produced only 895 bachelors de
grees. There are five and six-year ma
jors to be considered, but incoming trans
fers are also included in the number of 
degrees earned by that class. These num
bers suggest that approximately 25 per
cent of this class did not graduate.
For the student psyche, it can be a 
distressing fact to be attending a school 
that seems to be endlessly shrinking in 
student body, especially when students 
consider the chance that 25 percent of 
their friends will not be at graduation. 
Perrin Rowland, a freshman in H&SS, 
said, The fact that the retention rate is 
so low scares me when I think about it, 
but then again I dont usually think 
about it because Im so busy doing work. 
Not only freshmen are affected by this 
situation. Senior Erik Applewhite, Psy
chology/Philosophy major, has been ob
serving this over the past four years. 
Its scary to see your freshman class 
disappear, [but] its nice, though, cause 
were still here. Its almost like a doubleedged sword...
Part of the fear-causing effect is that 
none of the students know exactly why 
so many people leave CMU. A lot of the 
students attending the university now
think that perhaps a lot of the people 
who left were those who had been admit
ted on border-line terms, which is inter
estingly the same perspective that was 
presented in the 1986 Tartan article.
The retention rate would be also be 
affected as students were asked by the 
university to leave their school of spe
cialty, or leave CMU entirely. Situa
tions such as these are usually indi
vidual cases, but an interesting process 
in the Drama Department of CFA pro
vides some explanation.
About ten years ago, the retention 
rate was outrageously low in the drama 
department. Approximately 50 fresh
man applicants would be accepted, and 
by the end of two semesters, that num
ber would be cut down to nineteen. The 
process was a tortuous one as well.
After exam time, each drama majors 
grades would be posted up on a board, in 
an envelope. At the end of the report, 
students found out whether or not they 
had been cut. Because of the 
department's policies, 19 remaining ma
jors would then watch 31 of their 
dramat friends go to either another 
college within CMU, another univer
sity, or leave the field of academia alto
gether.
The cuts process has been vastly 
modified since then. Now, the drama 
admissions process only accepts about 
19 freshmen applicants, which is usu
ally cut down to about 15 by the end of 
the school year. There are other alterna
tives now, and the cutting process is not 
so rigid.
Now, the department will initially put 
a student on probation. The department 
will then work with them to guide them 
towards their standards. If, at the end of
the second semester, the department 
feels that the student is still not fulfilling their criteria, an advisor will sug
gest that the student switch to a theater 
studies major, without having to switch 
out of CFA, and they can graduate with 
the same basics that would have come 
from majoring in drama.
Another factor is one that affects re
tention within the individual colleges as 
opposed to the entire university. Many 
students will enter a school of specialty 
with an intended major in mind, and 
realize within the first year that what 
they are aiming for in that specified area 
is not what they really want. This situ
ation is common in both CFA, and cer
tain of the schools of science.
It is usually fairly easy to transfer 
between colleges at CMU, but as one 
student said, Once you've spent a whole 
year concentrating on that field, and 
then you have to start over entirely, it 
can feel really discouraging. I had a 
friend who was an architecture major, 
who decided that he really wanted to go 
into another area, and he felt discour
aged by the university about how the 
academic transfer would go. I mean, I 
think he got the impression,that he 
would be really behind everyone else 
when he switched, and that made his 
decision difficult.
Depite the obvious, the reason behind 
such a low retention rate is vague. Per
haps it is the high tuition, or the rigor
ous academic structure, or a combina
tion of things that causes students to 
leave this university, yet other universi
ties have equally great, if not greater, 
expectations, as well as substantially 
high tuitions, and have not earned the 
poor retention rate that CMU has.
Athletic financing 
spread all around
By SHANNON GIBNEY
Tartan Staffwriter
The Universitys yearly allo
cations to its sports teams are 
as disparate in amount as they 
are varied in application. In an 
interview Thursday, Director 
of Athletics and Physical Edu
cation John Harvey revealed 
that the football team receives 
the most money, at $65,000 
annually.
Mens and womens basket
ball follow at $20,000 each, 
mens and womens Soccer at 
$15,000 each, and the $15,000 
budget for swimming is shared 
between the mens and womens 
teams. Mens Track receives 
$15,000 annually, while the 
womens team is allotted 
$11,000 due to a smaller squad. 
Harvey said that the estimated 
budgets of all other sports were 
considerably smaller than those 
above.
According to Harvey, these 
numbers were rough estimates, 
as the budgets for each sport 
spill over to all other programs 
in the physical education de
partment, due to the integrated 
nature of the office. He said 
that a total of about 420 stu
dents participate in intercolle
giate sports (roughly 9.3% of 
the undergraduate population).
The various factors that 
cause a difference in budgets 
are the number of people in
volved, the type of equipment, 
the number of contests and 
where they are located, and how 
many people you try to recruit 
every year. Harvey also as
serted that these factors con
tribute to the relatively high 
cost of football.
Footballs expenses are more 
because they have more people, 
and because of the protective 
equipment that they use, said 
Joan Maser, associate director 
of athletics.
Just in the last 10 years the 
price of helmets and shoulder 
pads have been steadily in
creasing (helmets cost about 
$110 each, and shoulder pads 
are around $90). Given this fact, 
it is very expensive to outfit a 
football player, and when you 
do it with 90-100 people, it gets 
costly.
Rich Lackner, head football
coach supports this claim. 
Were traveling with around 
55 players, while other sports 
have much less people.
When questioned about the 
equality of budget Lackner 
said, I dont really sit back 
and compare myself with other 
sports, other teams on cam
pus. I just concern myself with 
what we need to be success
ful.
Some other athletes, how
ever, believe that the budget is 
not divided equitably. In terms 
of who gets what amount of 
money I know some people 
(athletes and coaches) dont 
think that its fair... weve had 
transportation problems. We 
were riding on ratty old buses 
all the time. People would say 
If we were the football team 
we wouldnt be standing here 
an hour late, waiting for the 
bus, said a female track run
ner who asked to remain 
anonymous. I know were 
treated differently, as not as 
important.
In response to this claim of 
inequity, Lackner cited a few 
examples of the football teams 
willingness to contribute to the 
department as a whole. He 
stated that the varsity weight 
room was donated to the foot
ball team by an outside source. 
Later, other coaches came to 
him, asked if their teams could 
use it, and Lackner agreed.
Likewise, the monies for the 
football locker room, and train
ing room were donated by the 
CMU football alumni group.
The people and programs 
that think theyre being shafted 
should be grateful that there 
are people out there who are 
generous enough to donate 
these facilities, Lackner said.
The issue may not lie in who 
gets what money, but in where 
the money comes from. The 
finance available to sports 
teams is divided into two basic 
budgets: the Equipment and 
General Operating Budget 
(E&GO), and the Occasional 
Expenses Budget.
The University gives us the 
allocation for the entire year 
for basic operating expenses. 
Sports get funding from this 
(E&GO), said Maser. ProTartnr nrr Nsehdo Stfr w
Campus prepares for alums
By JASON ANDRACK3
Tartan Staffwriter
Homecoming is nearly here. 
The festivities on and around 
campus begin on Friday and con
tinue until Sunday. Activities for 
both alumni and current students 
have been planned mostly by 
Alumni Relations, but almost all 
of the university has had some 
part in the planning.
Work on this years Homecom
ing began just a few days follow
ing last years Homecoming. 
Paula DiGioia (IM88), associate 
director of Alumni Relations, has 
been in charge of the planning for 
this years Homecoming.
The Homecoming events kick 
off Friday with receptions by 
various reunion years and the 
individual colleges plus tours of 
the Alumni House and Hunt 
Librarys Fine and Rare Book 
Room.
Throughout the entire day, 
alumni will have a chance to see 
how the learning process has 
changed by visiting selected 
classes. Alums can travel off cam
pus with CFA Dean Martin 
Prekop on a free trip to the Andy 
Warhol (A 49) Museum. The first 
of many activities for current stu
dents and alumni is a discussion 
by NASA astronaut Jay Apt (son 
of Joan and J erome Apt )(E 44) at 
3 pm. Also, an excellent opportu
nity for pre-law students to speak 
with lawyers at a 4 pm reception 
in Baker Hall 254C.
Another fine opportunity for 
students to mingle with Alumni 
is the Evening of Music at Sol
diers and Sailors Hall in Oak
land. The event will feature a 
dinner and a concert by the 
Carnegie Mellon Philharmonic. 
The first of many Homecoming 
sporting events takes place at 
7:30 pm in Gesling Stadium as 
the mens soccer team takes on 
New York University.
Saturday, the biggest day for 
Homecoming is highlighted by 
the first celebration of the W amer 
Years, and A Conversation with 
the President. For alumni and 
student athletes there is the 
Highlander Games at 9:30 am on 
the Cut.
This is a new twist on the origi
nal Highlander Games which in
volved Throwing the Caber (a 
log akin to a telephone pole). 
Rather than toss telephone poles, 
students and alumni can com
pete in a tug-o-war, mini-foot
ball, tennis and dodge ball, plus 
others contests.
Directly following the High
lander Games will be the Picnic 
on the Cut (free to students!). 
From the picnic, alumni and their 
friends and family, plus teams 
from the Highlander Games will 
parade into Gesling Stadium to
watch the football team take on 
the U.S. Merchant Marine. While 
many alumni are at the Recep
tion and Dinner Dance, students 
will be treated to a Concert Un
der the Stars. The concert will 
feature The Gathering Field (who 
released their first CD this past 
Tuesday) and Scott and Rob from 
the Clarks as the openers. Re
unions and receptions for alums 
also continue throughout Satur
day.
Rounding out the weekend on 
Sunday will be a Farewell Brunch 
and two soccer games. First at 1 
pm the the womens team will 
face Emory University and at 2 
pm the mens team will also face 
off against Emory.
The final event of homecoming 
will be the Mastercard ACTS at 4 
pm. This is a chance for aspiring 
musicians to participate in a 
battle of the bands and for spec
tators to enjoy some great music. 
The bands vie for a cash prize and 
a chance to compete against other 
schools bands for a opening slot 
for a national touring act.
Those planning Homecoming 
have received aid from Student 
Government President, Declan 
McCullagh, especially in publi
cizing the events and generating 
student interest.
McCullagh transferred from 
Rutgers University where Home
coming is a very big event. Id
like (our) Homecoming to be as 
strong as other schools.
Dana Wettergreen (S$7), an 
associate director of Alumni Re
lations said, [Homecoming is] 
the single largest alumni event of 
the year. With still a few d 
left for reservations, already close 
to 600 alumni (over twice as many 
as last year) plus guests plan to 
return to their alma mater mak
ing this one of the largest Home
coming celebrations in recent 
years.
Two alumni from the class of 
1924 who are in their nineties 
plan to attend all of the events for 
the weekend. This Homecoming 
is rather special because it marks 
the first time the Warner Years 
(1951-1964, the years under 
President Jake Warner) will be 
celebrated.
No matter how special this 
Homecoming is, it has faced 
serious problem, the destruction 
of Skibo. There are no la 
spaces, so the gymnasium must 
be used.
This poses the problem of no 
handicapped accessible rest
rooms. According to Dr. Steven 
Calvert, Theres no thrill like 
making a ballroom out of a gym.
With all of the activities 
planned for alumni and students 
alike, there is certainly something 
for everyone to take part in this 
weekend.

Subject. Eyes. Your window to the 
world. Through them you see all that you 
have never seen, so the care for them is 
important. But knowing who can provide 
the best care for your eyes takes 
education.
Learn. Ask if eye exams are
comprehensive and if contact lenses are custom 
fitted. Ask if a board-certified doctor, like 
Dr. Robert Greenberg, Optomitrist, will examine 
your eyes. And ask if there is a 20% discount 
for students, faculty and staff... everyday.
Lesson. Never assume anything. Never be

about your eyes the better decision you 
can make on how to care for them.

By SHARMILA VENKATASUBBAN lated from public response and interacfartan Junior Staffwriter tion with other writers in the immediate
area.
Searching for an escape from the usual, The Beehive readings attempt to estedious night life offered in downtown tablish a comfortable atmosphere, enOakland last Thursday, I finally discov- couraging writers of not only poetry,
ered a taste of something new at the 
Beehive, with the commencement of the 
fall readings, featuring local writersfrom the anxious first time reader to the 
most captivating representation of tal
ent.
The readings were held upstairs, the
small room filling to __________________
about 70. As the audi
ence welcomed any 
and all that came be
fore them, the air 
lacked that bit of ten
sion that occurs mo
ments before new 
readers begin their 
pieces. __________
The readings began
; 8:00, with a half hour designated for 
open mic, followed by three featured 
readers of the night.
The local readings were created in 
response to a lack of opportunity in 
Pittsburgh for developing writers in the 
area. Having no outlet to express their 
work, many creative writing majors of 
both Pitt and Carnegie Mellon felt isoBeehive readings provide 
literary outlet for students
but music, fiction and drama as well.
The growing trend in Pittsburgh can 
be attributed to the creation of a number 
of new coffeehouses in and around the 
city, many of which hold readings simi
lar to those found at the Beehive, lack
ing only the open mic at the onset of the
"Poetry readings have become 
increasingly popular in the
Micks Kochanskyj
reading.
Poetry readings have become increas
ingly popular in the area, said the event 
coordinator and CMU alumnae Micki 
Kochanskyj, not only due to an increase 
of interest in the local talents, but also 
from a desire to find new forms of cheap 
entertainment.
For absolutely nothing, anyone can
spend the evening experiencing the birth 
of the very artists that try to represent 
our culture, times, and often our genera
tion.
If that werent enough, it also provides 
for a comfortable atmosphere to meet 
new people, a social aspect that many 
CMU students will be able to appreci
ate.
Last Thursday the Beehive hosted a 
variety of works by local writers; the 
featured readers were all students of 
Carnegie Mellon looking for a forum to 
express their talent.
After the open mic, the evening con
tinued with a dynamic reading of poems 
by Jeremy Kriegal, a sophomore at CMU 
in the English department. He found the 
audience to be incredibly receptive, very 
encouraging.
The Beehive series was the second of 
two readings at which he presented his 
work, where he also felt a lot happier 
with his reading, due in part to the 
active responsiveness of the audience.
Kriegal was followed by two fellow 
students, Troy Benowitz and Brock 
Hamlin, equally encompassing as 
Kriegal, not only in the work itself but in 
their readings as well.
This week the Beehive presents fic
tion by Michael Cox and poetry by Kristin 
Herbert.
Athletic teams 
share funding
Nsehdo x'Dg Stfr z
gram and ticket sales get put 
into an account that continues 
year to year. We use it (Occa
sional Expenses Budget) for 
student help, for things like 
making tickets and programs. 
Its a minimal fund, and its 
used for special situations or 
events (for example if a coach 
wants to go to a conference), 
she added.
All sports teams receive their 
funding from a general fund 
that is allotted to the physical 
education department from the 
University planning and bud
get office.
Money comes from the main 
University fund to the Vice 
Presidents office and then to 
our office. We get the annual 
budget and then divide it be
tween the five or six parts of 
our (Physical Education) pro
gram, said Harvey.
In our department there are 
intercollegiate varsity sports, 
... club sports, which get most 
of their money from the Stu
dent Senate, but we help them 
out a little bit (provide facili
ties).
We also fund intramural 
sports (which had an annual 
cost of about $9,000 last year), 
physical education classes that 
students can take for credit, 
the free recreation program 
(which provides equipment 
such as basketballs and tennis
rackets, as well as a facilities 
in which students can use 
them), the aerobics program 
(which offers 34 classes per 
week), and part of the budget 
goes to the salaries of people 
that work in the department 
full time (24). An unusual 
amount of the budget goes to 
repairing and upkeeping the 
(gym) building (this year costs 
were at around $55,000). The 
gym was built in 1923, so it is 
71 years old ... facilities costs 
us a lot for building mainte
nance each year.
Harvey said that this years 
physical education budget was 
around $700,000. This num
ber is inclusive of all the pro
grams that the department 
runs.
The University sets the per
cent increase or decrease youll 
get for the year. Then you have 
to work within that, said Maser.
When asked how he would 
respond to a (hypothetical) 
students assertion that she or 
he should not have to pay more 
tuition to fund someone elses 
football game Harvey said, 
The portion that they pay 
does not necessarily have to 
be used for a football game. If 
they never come to that, we 
sponsor enough things that we 
think that enough students 
could benefit if they wanted 
to.
Mobots race at 
CMU this year
By SUSAN WATSON
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
In the spring of 1995, the First An
nual Downhill Mobot Slalom Race will 
be held. Taking place on the Cut in 
front of Wean Hall, the race is in
tended to unify students at CMU as 
they work together to build vehicles 
that can complete the course success
fully and efficiently. Each course will 
be in a slalom or downhill fashion and 
will contain twelve wicket style gates 
through which the vehicles must suc
cessfully pass in order to proceed in 
the race. The courses will range from 
easy to difficult. The winner of the 
competition will be determined based 
on factors such as time and accuracy 
in successfully passing through the 
gates. The vehicles must be self con
tained and small enough to fit through 
the 15" by 15" gates. They also may not 
contain antennae.
Electrical and computer engineer
ing major Ben Brown, a member of the 
Mobot Race Committee, feels confi
dent about the success of the race. 
Brown commented, Our objective is 
to get a broad range of participation 
from students. We hope the partici
pants will work together in interdisci
plinary teams. He hopes for a large
number of competitors, particularly 
from students within the science and 
engineering fields.
The organizers of the race still have 
many details to work out, such as the 
date of the race and specific scoring 
criteria. They also must design the 
courses which are scheduled to be con
structed during the fall.
Many students may compare the 
Mobot Race to the Buggy Competition 
which takes place during Spring Car
nival.
However, the organizers of the Mobot 
Race feel the it contrasts with the 
Buggy Race in many ways. Brown 
said, The Mobot Race is different from 
Buggy in that the Mobot Race is 
smaller in scale and the emphasis of 
the competition is placed on the actual 
vehicle. My hope is that those not 
involved in the Buggy Race will get 
involved with the Mobot Race.
Prizes will be awarded to the three 
best performing entries:
First Prize - $1000 
Second Prize - $500 
Third Prize - $250 
Vehicles must be registered with 
the Computer Science Department by 
March 15,1995. If you have questions 
or comments about the race send email to Mobot @ cs.cmu.edu.

Welcome to the first install
ment of Focused on the Internet. 
Im Kenton, your guide. Think of 
me as a hybrid Fantasy Islands 
Tattoo and the Twilight Zones 
Rod Serling. Im not like either 
one, but it pleases me to make 
you imagine it. If youve never 
seen Fantasy Island or TwilightZone episodes, thats OK 
I can accept that you live in a 
cultural void. Hopefully you can, 
too.
In this column Ill focus on net
work issues, on USENET issues, 
on the computer culture, on any 
issues related to the Andrew com
puter system, (which is celebrat
ing its 11th year of existence, on 
the Internet at large), and on 
various random topics.
That brings up this weeks trivia 
question: Was Fantasy Island 
still running when the Andrew 
system started? Ill publish the 
name of the first correct 
respondant. Send answers to 
kenton+@CMU.EDU.
What *is* the Andrew sys
tem? freshmen typically wonder, 
in a heroic attempt to augment 
their clue stores. Lets find out. I 
wandered in to the academic computing offices in Cyret Hall in 
search of information. An Aca
demic Computing Systems pro
grammer, Chris Neuman, told me 
this: Andrew is a set of distrib
uted services provided by com
puting services. The major com
ponents are AMS (email/ 
bboards), Printing, AFS (central 
file storage), software support/ 
distribution, and backups. We 
also provide other small services 
like Zephyr and White Pages (via 
finger). All of these services are 
monitored with a goal of keeping 
them available all the time.
The programs EZ Mail(DOS), 
MacMail II(Macs), and Messages 
(X Windows) are computing in
terfaces to the Andrew Mes
sage System (AMS). Chris tells 
me that Academic Computinghas 
him working to expand AMS to 
better bear the heavy use we all 
subject it to. He referred to this 
as the Cyrus project, which is 
apparently named after the 6th 
century founder of the Persian 
Empire.
Modern-day Persia was the 
birthplace of President Mehrabian. (IMO, a meaningful code 
name is almost as worthy as a 
long acronymn). Tehran, Iran, of 
course. Oh wait, Im not spoiling 
any of the plot, am I Professor 
Steams? Sorry!
Well have more next week.

the Buick and brought it back 
up to good ol Donner 231, I 
thought, There we go. Now no 
one will clean all of this up and 
lose everything.
Throughout my lifetime at 
home I couldnt leave for a week 
before someone would go into 
my room to clean up everything 
in sight. This someone was 
(and still is) my own beloved 
mother.
Now, she has converted my 
eight-year-old brother into a ra
bid no-holds-barred cleaning 
person. His room is immacu
late. He even has a huge Ziploc 
bag over his Sega to keep the 
dust off. He already knows how 
to make his bed -- which ac
cording to my mom is a much 
greater accomplishment than 
learning to set the VCR clock. 
Any adult can make a bed, I 
explained, but only 20% can 
set a VCR clock.
So? My mom would envariably say.
Since then I have given up 
telling both mother and brother 
to stay out of my room. Not only 
do they go in and clean it when
ever they damn well please, 
they think its the most fitting 
place to keep my big brothers 
bowling trophies.
Two weeks after I moved in, I 
had to go back home for Re
serve drill, and sure enough my 
room was gone  over with a 
fine-toothed comb. Even under 
my bed was spotless. I couldnt 
find my half-decent clothes ei
ther, and the bowling trophies 
were more sparkling than ever.
Also, my brother had saved 
up enough money and bought 
himself a telescope. A telescope 
is a good thing to have in the 
suburbs where most of the ar
eas are lit and the stars are 
visible one night per week. Then 
I learned that my whole family 
had come down with the flu a 
while ago. Very encouraging. I 
thought I had escaped it until I 
came back here and had to 
swear off solid food for four days.
Our own beloved Tom Harper, 
sophomore Physics / CS major, 
is still taking enough Sudafed 
to recommend good stock tips in 
it.
Dalmo Optical: The Educated Choice,
Subject. Eyes. Your window to the 
world. Through them you see all that you 
have never seen, so the care for them is 
important. But knowing who can provide 
the best care for your eyes takes 
education.
Learn. Ask if eye exams are
comprahensive and if contact lenses are custom 
fitted. Ask if a board-certified doctor, like 
Dr. Robert Greenberg, Optomitrist, will examine 
your eyes. And ask if there is a 20 discount 
for students, faculty and staff... everyday.
Lesson. Never assume anything. Never be 
afraid to ask cjuestions. The more you know
about your eyes the better decision you 
can make on how to care for them.

Laddergrams
by Mark Kantrowitz
In a laddergram, the object 
is to transform the word 
on the top rung into the 
word on the bottom rung 
in the least number of 
steps. During each step 
you must replace one 
letter in the previous word 
so that a new word is 
formed, but without 
changing the positions of 
the other letters. For 
example, we can change 
LEAD into GOLD in just 
three steps: LEAD, LOAD, 
GOAD, GOLD.

rhe Family Cat: look out for this great new band
By LESLEY A. KAY
artan Assistant Features 
'editor
From the opening rifts of Magic 
lappens, the first American re
ease for the five-piece band The 
[Family Cat, the listener truly 
believes that magic can and does 
happen.
The unique three guitar sound 
opens with hard-driving, disflrted ambrosia that made me 
gtop and think Wait, I thought 
hese guys were from England! 
However after listening to the 
first few songs, the immediate 
urprise becomes unimportant as
youlet the melodic distortion
wrap around you. The three guiars are simply amazing, the band 
delivers a sound that connects 
our eardrums to the speakers. 
Yet, even with so much aural 
istraction possible, The Family 
Cat manages to avoid
slipping into monotony. A multi
plicity of changes combined with 
frequent and complex guitar so
los takes the listener through the 
melodramatic ups and downs of 
youth. Slow melodic numbers are 
marked by intense changes where 
the band remains so tight that 
you expect them to merge or fall 
apart all together.
Despite the fact that this is 
obviously a guitar oriented band, 
the album still manages to pull 
the focus away from the exten
sive guitars with prominent bass 
lines and vocals.
The occasional focus on typical 
rhythm instruments delights 
the ear with bass solos and a few 
complicated drum fills. Further
more, the vocals are derived from 
witty lyricism and the lead 
singers excellent, although obvi
ously British, voice.
Overall, Magic Happens works 
well together as an album. All of 
the songs are good and several of 
the songs stand out.
Many of the songs gravitate to
wards the word brilliant 
through the use of unexpected 
techniques. For example, the 
eighth track, Goldenbook, capi
talizes on distorting the vocals. 
The song creates an upbeat por
trait of darker emotions and the 
problems of conformity.
Another interesting departure 
from expected conventions of 
popular music occurs on the 
twelfth and final track of the 
album, Nowhere to Go but 
Down. The song begins with un
accompanied vocals in an upbeat, 
almost clich, happy song with 
the first line of Be Sad, be happy 
and be wise... and then contin
ues with the intensity and elec
tricity of the band to describe an 
almost existentialist picture of 
life complete with vivid philo
sophical imagery.
Another great track on the al
bum is Hamlet for Now. The 
track, as the title suggests, mod
ernizes Shakespeares tragedy 
and expresses the ease in identi
fying with the famous
The Family Cat is a very cool band. Check out this album for great guitar riffs.
Hamlet. The song is complete 
with the needed chaos and emo
tion of any good Hamlet. The in
terruptions of chaos are pleas
antly contrasted with the tight
ness and ascending solos of the 
chorus and the sometimes mel
low, sometimes in
tense music characterizes much 
of The Family Cacs music.
In general, even though this 
band is new to .America, expect 
big things from them. No other 
band has ever captured the in
tensity of youth and its often 
manic-depressive character with 
such a hard-driving guitar sound 
and still managed to
keep their musical integrity.
So, if you are looking for a band 
that can emulate intensity of feel
ing or if you would like to experi
ence the relative ease with which 
a band pulls off the complex task 
of integrating a five-piece group 
into one unique sound, check out 
The Family Cat's Magic Happens; 
you wont be disappointed.
Rusted Root drums up a 
great new album, sound
By PAUL TABACHNECK
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
.
Artist: Rusted Root 
Album: When I Woke 
[Suggested Tracks: Beautiful People, 
Cat Turned Blue, Food and Creative 
Love, Back to the Earth, Send Me On 
My Way, and the rest of the album, too.
Residents of Pittsburgh and Carnegie 
ellon upperclassmen alike are prob
ably already familiar with the earthy 
world beat tones of Pittsburghs own 
Rusted Root. These seven musicians 
have created a snowball of rythmic acints around the songs of core member
JToo-fiichael Glabicki that is so massive and 
ntrancing that one cannot supress the 
rge to jump and dance when experiencng it. The one conundrum that has 
Iways faced the septet was the secret to 
apturing their live energy on tape, for 
nyone to enjoy at home.
Their first effort, a four song-demo 
dorned with a character that fans 
ubbed the Christ-Monkey on the 
)ver, was not quite what the fans were 
oldng for. They made a valid attempt, 
put not a total success, with the release 
their first full length album on 
ittsburghs Blue Duck Records, Cruel
Sun (still available at some record stores, 
and through an order form inside When 
I Woke). Although the album was a com
mercial success (it sold over 20,000 cop
ies in Pittsburgh alone), it lacked the 
sound that Root was capable of. The 
guitar sound was brittle, and the drums 
were not miked as well as they could 
have been.
It did, however, obtain record-label 
interest, and snagged them a multi-album deal with Mercury Records. When I 
Woke is the first product of this labor, 
and I must say that it is a huge improve
ment. Producer Bill Botrell (Sheryl Crow) 
has found the essence of RRs sound and 
maximized its strong points, as well as 
capturing its subtleties. The album opens 
with a self-descriptive track entitled 
Drum Trip, which features strong per
cussion backed up by Jenn Wertz and 
Liz Berlins swelling background vocals. 
The whole ensemble makes this 
instrumetal into a vehicle that its listen
ers will joyfully ride, directly into a crowd 
pleaser called Ecstacy.
The album continues to flow with posi
tive energy, pausing only to contem
plate the suicide of a friend with the 
song Beautiful People (formerly en
titled Shaman). The guitar sound is 
thick and juicy, and the energy in the 
interweaving voices and instruments, 
particularly in B.P. and Cat Turned 
Blue (nowsans-Dylan), is engaging from 
the first beat of Trip to the last strain 
of the sentimental Back to the Earth.
All in all, this album will make an 
excellent groundbreaker for the Pitts
burgh music scene, and hopefully, make 
a few hours a little easier for the rest of 
the world. Hope you enjoy it.
Rusted Root will be appearing at the 
A.J. Palumbo Center with special guests 
the Dave Matthews Band at the end of 
October. Tickets are $15, call the local

Body Count surprises with 
power, strength, politics
By ERIC J. SALZMAN
Tartan Features Editor
When Ice T started singing with 
a heavy m etal thrash band named 
Body Count, the music world was 
intrigued with the first hard core 
rapper turned metal. When the
Mooseman (bass), D Roc (rhythm 
guitars), and Beatmaster V 
(drums), produced an album with 
anger, intensity, and some elec
trifying, albeit basic, rock music.
Bom Dead is the bands second 
release and the first with Virgin 
records. The album takes every
thing with emo
tion from the 
first album and 
intensifies it.
Rap fans of Ice 
T may fnd themselves disap
pointed with the 
new sound. In 
fact some may 
say he sold out to 
the world of rock 
n roll; however, 
Ice T and Body 
Count are not 
afraid to expand 
from rap into 
hard rock/speed 
metal.
The opening 
track, Body M/F 
Count does not 
offer the intense

hood from the first album, but 
the emotion and anger can be 
heard in the guitar, drums, and 
intensity of Ice Ts voice.
In fact, many of the songs are 
short on lyrics. Songs like Kill
ing Floor and Drive By get the
controversial track Cop Killer 
gained publicity, the whole coun
try was intrigued with what the 
band was saying; a few people 
even began to wonder why. Ice T, 
along with band members Ernie 
C (lead and acoustic guitars),
message across with minimum 
vocals along with extended 
intrumental solos.
One can only laugh when the 
seventh track, Hey Joe, comes 
on. The music industry may fear 
what Ice T would do with a cover 
of the classic written by Billy 
Roberts (but probably more iden
tified with Jimi Hendrix). The 
result is beautiful. Ice Ts vocals 
more than do the song justice 
while Ernies Cs improvisation 
around the guitar score adds ex
citement without taking away the 
sound of the original tune.
The albums title track makes 
sure the bands political position 
will not go unnoticed. They know 
we stand for three things, truth, 
justice, and fuck the American 
way! doesnt really leave much 
room for interpretation. Body 
Count is still mad.
The beauty of Born Dead is the 
sheer indulgence in rock music. 
The guitars are heavy, the beat 
fast, and the lyrics intense.
Ice T, as usual, has political 
messages within his lyrics; how
ever, this time, they are less con
troversial. His songs include talk 
about killing, dissatisfaction with 
the establishment, and drug use, 
but listeners are unlikely to find 
such blatant controversy as of
fered in Cop Killer. The words 
are there, but so is the sound.
Body Counts first album may 
have made waves with its mes
sage; this time the music should 
do the talking.

Jazz delights crowds at

For the last couple of years, virtual

On its latest visit to Pittsburgh, Virtu

a first taste of the future, and I must say 
it was incredible.
To get a bit of background, I showed up 
early, and ended up taking part in the 
trial run. Derek Russo, who works for 
Virtuality, showed me around the sys

The control center consisted of a circu

ring. There was a helmet, which had a 
3-D monitor inside, and a hand-held

The two players (al

to shoot oddly-shaped mis

can see being held in front

with their hand move

I got to play three times (including the

awesome experience, control

I spoke to some of the people 
from the Activities Board, and 
although I cant quote what

there is a large number of regu

River Wild creates tension successfully
By DAN GOLDWASSER
Tartan Staffwriter
The River Wild is riddled with tension 
which entertains and thrills you. Two 
time Academy Award winner Meryl 
Streep (Sophies Choice) is Gail, an ex
movie will let you appreciate how grand 
nature really is. But, when talking about 
filming on a fast-moving river, the chal
lenges of making a film double in com
plexity. The river will not stop when the 
director yells Cut! It will keep moving, 
and take you along with it, especially if 
river guide turned teacher for the deaf youre on a boat. So, many scenes have a
to fit the character. Watching Bacon was 
like watching a bad movie from the early 
80s, most of which I think starred Kevin 
Bacon. I think that someone a bit more
who, in a last-ditch effort to save her 
marriage, takes her son and her hus
band on a white-water rafting trip. David 
Strathaim (Sneakers) is Gails husband, 
Tom. An architect, he had put his work 
before his family, and has decided that
pacing problem. But that doesnt detract 
from the film at all.
Filled with incredible scenery, breath
taking action sequences, and incredible 
stunts, The River Wild is a movie that 
probably cannot be categorized. But I 
will do so anyway.
This is your standard 
tense thriller, which does 
more to make you nervous 
than to let^you think about 
what youre seeing. The 
characters are a bit washed 
over, and Meryl Streep 
seems an awkward choice 
for the role. She just doesnt 
seem to be the person you 
would picture as a riverrunner. She also has this 
look on her face throughout 
the movie that makes you 
want to cringe.
David Strathairn at first 
seemed like a bad choice for 
going on this trip might be a good way for the role of Tom, but in the end, it seemed 
the family to get back together. Of course, to be the right decision. All in all, not a

movie about a family going down
stream mending their personal prob
lems might make a nice drama, but this 
film, directed by Curtis Hanson (The 
Hand That Rocks The Cradle), is any
thing but calm. Enter Wade (Kevin Ba
con, Flatliners) andTerry (John C. Reilly, 
Whats Eating Gilbert Grape), two mys
terious strangers who force Gail and 
Tom, to take them down river. From 
there on, the movie is virtually non-stop, 
and will leave you clutching your seat.
Filmed in one of the most beautiful 
settings I have seen in film recently, this
bad actor, but there were some points 
where I was asking myself, Is this the 
right guy for the role? Yes, I guess it 
was.
Joseph Mazzello (.Jurassic Park) is 
perfect for the role of Gails and Toms 
son, Roarke. But the biggest casting 
problem I had was with Kevin Bacon.- It 
could be that I just dont like Kevin 
Bacon as an actor, but he really did 
not fit this role. The role called for charm 
(which I guess he has) and malevolence 
(which he really doesnt have). Sure he 
was mean, and cruel, but he didnt seem

believable, like Robert De Niro would 
have been better for the role. But maybe 
thats just because he was great in Cape 
Fear.
All acting thoughts aside, The River 
Wild made for a fun, exciting movie. The 
tension was enough to give me an ulcer, 
and Curtis Hanson is going to be making 
it bigin Hollywood in the next few years.
An aspect which can either add or 
subtract from the movie experience is 
the music. Oscar winner Jerry Gold
smith (.Basic Instinct, The Omen) does a 
great job adding to the tension of the 
film through his talent.
The River Wild is a film worth seeing 
not for the acting, but for the spectacu
lar scenery and action. Since this was a 
sneak-preview, I dont really know where 
the movie will be playing. But look for it 
at a theater in either Squirrel Hill or 
Monroeville sometime next weekend.
Guitarist lacks 
passion, good lyrics
By ANDREW SPROULE
Tartan Editor-in-Chief
If you asked someone who Gilby Clarke is, the response you receive would 
probably be, Is he that Axl Rose guys friend? To which the answer would be, 
Why yes, yes he is. Clarke filled the slot as the Gunners rhythm guitarist 
during their Use Your Illusion tour. One of the great things about Guns n 
Roses was that they took the mediocre genre of heavy metal music and filled it 
with rage and fun. Unfortunately,
Clarke on Pawnshop Guitars isnt able 
to avoid the parody that heavy metal 
inevitably becomes.
The only clich avoided on this album 
is the one about being in love with 
underage women. The opening song,
Cure Me ... Or Kill Me ... leaves the 
listener hoping that there is no cure for 
Clarkes disease.
Lets Get Lost, opens the second 
side. The lyrics, Lets get lost in space 
... Nothings wrong, everythings fine, 
lets get lost in time, speak to the very 
marrow of, well, to the very core of, um, 
nothing really. However, if youre look
ing for banal lyrics, just check the rest of 
the songs out  not many of them are 
lacking.
As with any album, no .matter how 
mediocre, Guitars does have a few shin
ing moments. Two of these shining mo
ments are cover tunes. Dead Flowers, penned by Mick Jagger and Keith 
Richards is good enough to make one remember why the Stones used to be 
considered the best rock and roll band in the world. The song also contains 
backup vocals with Axl Rose and its nice to hear him wail on this mostly 
passionless album. Jail Guitar Doors, written by Joe Strummer and Mick 
Jones is a great Clash tune and Clarke manages to do it justice.
Skin and Bones is a country/blues send up that comes off as completely 
unaffected and seems totally out of place on this album. It would be a tune 
worthy of the Gunners but this album certainly doesnt deserve it.
Spinal Tap is often pointed to as the perfect parody of heavy metal music. 
However, metal music often reaches the realm where it self-actualizes into 
parody. Dont do this to yourself.
Oh, Gilby! What have you done? Giiby 
Clarkes not so great on his own.
New TV sitcom crosses racial barriers as Asians take the spotlight

Show: All-American Girl

DC takes over British Judge Dredd, cant compare to original
Comic Book Chronicles
 We fear change. Thats the only line 
iti the movie Waynes World that still 
^muses me. I guess I find it so funny 
tjecause I can identify with it  espe
cially when it comes to comic books.
 Au uDgPcno 199
F.QhZk mEkhh was known for its flat, plain artwork which made it 
^nlque. Since it moved to DC the art work has not been the same, 
Jjut the violence is still abundant.
When Judge Dredd ceased being pub^tished by the British company Fleetway 
(.Dredd was also put out by Eagle, Qual
ity, and originated in the British weekly
2000AD) and was picked up by DC, I 
shuddered with fear.
What would happen to my favorite 
disciplinarian outside of my junior high 
principal when the people at DC got hold 
of him? This fear was mixed with a little 
bit of relief. DC is a very stable and 
reliable company, so no longer do I worry 
about getting my Dredd fix every month.
The new DC Dredd has been out for 
four months, so its fair to pass judge
ment now. Probably a somewhat diffi
cult obstacle for the editors of this comic 
was producing a comic under the Comics 
Code Authority (CCA) that was never 
governed by any
thing like it for its 
17-year exist
ence.
That would be 
a problem if the 
CCA was some
thing more than a 
decoration in the 
comer, of the cov
ers of Marvel and 
DC books. The 
violence (there is 
and always was 
lots of it  Dredd 
alone kills over 18 
people in issue 
four  thats 
slightly less than 
one death per 
page) hasnt been toned down a bit, and 
the socialist views are as ever present as 
Big Brother. So were my fears un
founded? Read on.
Easily the most visible difference be
tween the DC Dredd and the British 
Dredd is the artwork.
You can easily note the 
American-attempting-to-imitate-Brit artwork of Mike Avon 
Oeming. How could you trust a 
guy with Avon in his name 
anyway?
The old British versions of 
Dredd werent as colorful 
(pretty drab actually), not very 
detailed, and when it comes 
down to it: werent too nice ar
tistically. But that was part of 
the appeal for me. It was differ
ent, but now the book has lost 
its identity in return for more 
exposure from a bigger com
pany.
The writing, on the other 
hand, is vastly improved over 
the original. Even the comic 
length Dredd stories from 
across the Atlantic had more of 
a comic strip feel to them (Dredd 
originally a strip in 2000AD), 
rather than the continuity of a 
book.
In just four issues Andrew 
Heifer has constructed three 
ongoing subplots. Thats three 
more than Ive seen in the past 
eight years of reading Dredd 
books.
Heifer also jnanages to keep the same 
wit and sarcasm of the original and 
combine it with better storytelling. And 
best of all, Dredds ever present helmet
stays on! Not for long, though, with the 
Judge Dredd movie in filming right now
 Au uDgPcno 199 .QhZk mEkhh has been acquired by DC. Mike Avon Oeming 
and Doug Selogy are the artists.
build, perfect jaw, and a smaller ego. 
Heifer isnt all perfect, though. He 
seems to have a little trouble 
trying to introduce the charac
ter and its history to new read
ers, but not bore the old read
ers.
The stories Im used to take 
place following the Presidents 
removal. Even though it was 
great to see the President (es
pecially portrayed a la George 
C. Scott as Scrooge), who will 
_ soon be ousted by the Chief 
Judge, Eustace Fargo, Heifer 
should make up his mind be
tween the two time periods.
So which is better, the old or 
the new? Although a difficult 
choice, the old wins out simply 
because DC will never have a 
cover with an old, one eyed beggar saying, Buddy can you 
spare an eye?
Change should be feared, but 
Dredd would agree that fear is 
good.

Poboody do whap whap say what yeah: a peek at some bad musicals
File 13
-i by Carey Clevenger
n Well, it seems as if the Bad 
Musical column that I promised 
yfcwo weeks ago is finally here! 
When I define a musical here, I 
cmean that its a film in which the
- music is apparently more impor
tant than the actual plot, stories, 
c.and characters.
For a good example of this, lets 
go back in time to the late 1970s: 
><a time when men were men, when
* women were women, and when 
frock bands wore platform shoes 
.and breathed fire. Im talking, of 
rjcourse, about Kiss (before they 
abandoned their makeup) and 
Uheir film debut (and, to my 
^knowledge, film finale).
-i ' Kiss Meets the Phantom of the 
Park plays more like a 90-minute 
-ad for Californias Magic Moun, tain theme park than a movie.
; The basic premise: The members 
| of Kiss (Gene The Demon
! Simmons, Ace Space Ace
; Frehley, Paul Star Child
! Stanley, and Peter Cat Man 
Criss) must stop Anthony Zerbe 
in his madcap scheme to replace 
humans with Folgers crystals  
sorry, couldnt resist that one.
It seems that the evil scientist 
is going to replace humans with 
evil robot clones, not unlike his 
! auto-animatronic attractions in 
! the park.
The film was originally made 
for TV. I knew this because of two 
dead-gi veaways.
One: Right after major plot de
velopments, the music comes up 
and the action fades to black. 
This is obviously where the com
mercials were intended to be 
placed. Two: It was produced by 
Hanna-Barbera.
Its worth watching for a lot of 
reasons. First, you get to see Kiss 
in their makeup ... what memo
ries that dug up! You know, I 
used to have a Peter Criss Hal
loween costume ... he was the 
coolest. Second, you get to see 
Kiss display their magical pow
ers, which are made possible 
through the use of their amulets 
(really nifty-looking plot devices).
These powers include Pauls 
ability to read minds, Aces lasershootin eyeballs, Genes fire 
breathing ability, and Peters cat
like reflexes. These are just the 
beginnings of their amazing abili
ties. They also cumulatively pos
sess some rather impressive telekinetic abilities  watch them 
move that box!
These powers are what made 
Kiss the powerhouse rockers that 
they were. They also gave them 
the incredible Kung Fu fighting 
prowess which they display to
ward the end of the film. They 
also were probably the reason 
why most parents thought that 
the members of Kiss were EVIL!
Third  theyre snappy dress
ers! Knee-boots, platform-shoes, 
studs, leather, and hooded cloaks!
Another good reason to watch 
this one is the witty and intrigu
ing script. When the robot Gene
destroys a breakaway booth at 
Magic Mountain, and the real 
Gene is accused of it, Peter re
torts: Not OUR Demon! 
Finally, the music! Classic Kiss 
tunes abound! As I said above, 
the music takes precedence over 
the plot; so there are probably a 
good fifteen minutes worth of con
cert footage (which coincides with 
Kiss fifteen minutes worth of 
fame).
Next up is the classic story 
of: Boy meets girl...boy loses 
girl...boy rescues girl from 
clutches of ganglord...boy 
skips town. The film is 
Streets of Fire.
If you think back to 1984, 
you may remember when this 
film was first released. The 
biggest hit on the soundtrack 
was Dan Hills I Can Dream 
About You. Remember that 
one? Boy, I sure do.
The cast itself is also quite 
memorable, in a forgettable 
sort of way. In other words, 
theyre a cast of people youve 
seen all over the place, but 
youd probably not know them 
by name. You know, people 
like Amy Madigan, Diane 
Lane, Lee Ving, Rick 
Rossovich, and Deborah Van 
Valkenberg. There are a few 
memorable exceptions, how
ever. Rick Moranis plays a 
cheesy concert-promoter guy, 
and Willem Dafoe (Jesus Christ!) 
plays the gang leader. Robert 
Townsend has a brief role as a 
backup singer in one of the bands.
by the immortal Michael Pare.
You may remember Pare from 
his roles in the similarly-veined 
Eddie and the Cruisers films.
Fortunately for us, however, 
he leaves the lip-synching to 
Diane Lane in this one. The down
side to this is that he actually 
speaks on camera. Of course, due 
to his inability to act, everything 
he says becomes hysterically 
funny.
The basic plot is this: Tom Cody, 
fresh out of the army, comes back
Ki!! Msst! ths Phantem 
ef ths Park
three bombs, four mysti
cal amulets, and the entire 
Kiss Army.
Strsst! ef Firs 
two bombs, a custom 
lever-action rifle, and sev
eral washed-up singing 
acts.
Reck 6n> Rell High 
Scheel
one bomb, two promo
tional Ramones tickets, and 
a 45 of I Want You 
Around.
And, the hero of the film is played
to his hometown, at the request 
of his big sister. Things are get
ting nasty in town, thanks to the 
local motorcycle gang.
When Toms ex-girlfriend, the
towns most popular chanteuese 
(Lane) is kidnapped by the leader 
of the gang (Dafoe), its time to 
take out the trash and rescue the 
girl! He does so by driving to the 
bad side of town and blowing up 
a couple of motorcycles. Dafoe, 
looking for vengeance, blows into 
town (with his thugs in tow) and 
proposes (of all things) a sledge
hammer fight!
Well, Pare beats up Dafoe (with 
his bare hands; the hammers 
probably would have been too 
graphic for a PG-rated film) and 
sends him off to jail. Then he 
leaves town with his sidekick 
(Amy Madigan). Roll credits. This 
may seem too abbreviated for a 
90-minute film; but, there are 
lots of musical numbers. In fact, 
the music is the best part of the 
film. Most of the songs, though, 
are lip-synched by people who 
had nothing to do with the song 
unfortunately.
As I mentioned earlier, theres 
I CanDream About You, which 
is probably the most well-known. 
There are also two tracks per
formed by a group called Fire, 
Inc. who, in my opinion, sound 
almost like Meatloaf sounded 
back in the 1970s  not just 
musically, but lyrically (The first 
song in the movie has the ultracheesy Meatloaf-ish line, [And] 
well fly away on those angelwings of hope in your daddys 
car. Weird).
My vote for best bad musical 
has to be Rock V Roll High 
School, starring the Ramones. 
Whats most frightening about
this movie is the fact that the 
Ramones, who themselves are not 
actors, are really better actors 
than the real actors in the movie.
Basic plot: The students of 
Vince Lombardi High, under the 
direction of Riff Randell (P.J. 
Soles) and assisted by the 
Ramones, take over the school. 
Add into the equation a big album-buming, a love story, ex
ploding mice, and lots of Ramones 
music. Theres lots of weird dia
logue, as well (including Riffs 
description of the sexy way Joey 
eats pizza: He just takes a slice 
ofpizza, andholdsitinhismouth, 
and lets it slide down his throat.) 
The plot itself isnt too impor
tant. Its one of those films that 
you just sort of have to see to 
understand. That was a good one, 
Mr. MacGruder.
Kiss Meets the Phantom of the 
Park gets three bombs, four mys
tical amulets, and the entire Kiss 
Army. ,
Streets of Fire gets two bombs, 
a custom lever-action rifle, and 
several washed-up singing acts.
Rock V Roll High School gets 
one bomb, two promotional 
Ramones tickets, and a 45 of I 
Want You Around.

 If I were to end the review

; take a Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds nvrxtV

Now Im A Cowboy, besides being the 
most horribly titled album of the debad ones), is a collection of 11 
works that lead brooder Luke 
Haines would like us to think 
of as songs, although theyre 
really just self-indulgent at
tempts.
The fact that Haines even 
bothers taking credit for them 
lowers my opinion of him that 
much more. He acts out the 
lyrics to King Missiles Sensi
tive Artist, by making allu
sions to people that no one 
knows, and holding the joke in 
to himself (I feel totally stupid 
because I cant understand the 
lyric Toulouse Lautrec called 
up Today/ Said its all Rock n 
Roll anyway). He takes us 
through one 5-minute torture 
after another, repeating what
ever guitar/vocal phrases he 
pleases, all musical justifica
tion be damned (the choruses 
in Chinese Bakery and Mod
em History make me writhe in ways that 
any doctor will tell you are not possible).
cade by a long shot (and Ive heard some That being told, we can move on to
production, credit going to Phil Vinall and, 
yest Mr. Haines as well. As near as I can 
tell, it goes like this: 1st verse and chorus 
are served up with acoustic guitars, and 
minimal drums, followed by a bridge that is 
supplemented with either hand claps, string 
arrangements, horn sections, or loud 
overdriven guitars with extra drum noise 
helping them all.
Whatever small amounts of feeling the 
first song, Lenny Valentino, had are lost 
when the automated hand claps come in a 
blind hope to make it peppier, poppier, and 
an all-around more infectious song. Ive 
heard more passionate sound from a 5- 
year-old with a mono tape recorder and a 
toy microphone. I think that if Phil Vinall 
were ever to make a rsum, The Auteurs 
would be very far away from it.
To be fair, I thought I would get a secong 
opinion. So, as I was writing this review, I 
put the CD on. An antire group of people 
squirmed over it. It was, to say the least, a 
harrowing experience.
So basically, Im going to do to The Auteurs 
what I hope Beavis and Butt-head would do 
if they were in my position:
Turn them off.

Hail Mary
Its not every day you can get good, old-time 
religion at DH2210. And this Thursday isnt one of 
those days. Hail Mary is a re-creation of the life of 
Jesus in modem day Paris featuring Mary as a gas 
station attendant and Joseph as a cab driver. The 
Pope wouldnt like this one, thats for sure.
Starring Juliette Binoche, Manon Anderson, and 
other French people, this film sounds, as the French 
say, kind of silly. But dont let that stop you. Di
rected by Jean-Luc Godard, it sparked controversy 
in the Catholic Church and is an interesting anach
ronism on the Jesus story. See it if you must.
At 6, 8,10pm and midnight.
FriYay, Ssptsmbsr 30
Philadelphia
A fairly gripping drama, this film stars Tom 
Hanks and Denzel Washington and was directed by 
Jonathon Demme. Dealing with the themes of ho
mosexuality and AIDS in America, PhilaYslphia 
describes the power and pain of discrimination 
against these ideas and subjects.
Powerfully written and well-acted, PhilaYslphia 
is a worth a look. Though a touch mainstream, it 
still has a strength that is its own. Itll make you cry, 
too, if youre into that sort of thing. A good Friday 
night movie.
At 5, 7:30,10pm, and 12:30am.
SaturYay, Octebsr 1
City Slickers 2
A fairly gripping drama, this film stars Billy 
Crystal, Daniel Stern, and Jack Palance. Palance 
plays Curlys brother or Curly 2 or something (be
cause he died in the original City Slicksr!) and 
Stem and Crystal play those .witty and wild city 
slickers that are after Curlys secret and wellhidden gold. This film deals with the themes of 
being a balding actor whose best movie was Whsn 
Harry Mst Sally... and whose career seems to be 
going downhill with great poignancy and insight.
Powerfully written and well-acted, City Slicksr! 2 
is worth a look Though a touch mainstream, it still 
has a strength that is its own. Itll make you cry, 
too, if youre into that sort of thing. Actually, its 
pretty good and pretty funny, and worth a dollar, at 
least. See it.
At 6, 8,10pm and midnight.

Roots in Hell
A close and nostalgic look at marijuana use 
throughout history, Marijuana: WssY! with Reet! 
in Hsll will bring a tear of love and understanding 
to the eyes of smokers and non-smokers alike.
Starring a few unknowns from the fifties and 
directed by nobody really important (Dwayne Esper, 
if you must know), this film details the joys and 
triumphs of a bunch of lovable kids who toke the 
dreaded weed. A warm movie to take the kids to.

Jesus visits modern day in Godard film
By WLADEYHR 
LABEIKOVSKY
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
What would happen if the 
miracle of the Immaculate Con
ception were to happen today? 
What would happen if a basket
ball-playing high-schooler were 
to be the Virgin Mary? This is 
roughly the setup for Jean-Luc 
Godards 1985 film Hail Mary. 
Characterized for being the most 
experimental and one of the most 
controversial filmmakers ever, 
Godard set off to film this very 
tender parable about miracles 
and the dichotomy between body 
and soul.
The film tells the story of Mary, 
the teenage daughter of a gasstation attendant who receives 
the Annunciation by the Archan
gel Gabriel, who happened to 
come by plane and is brought to 
Marys house by her taxi-driver 
boyfriend Joseph. Of course, this 
being modern age, nobody be
lieves that this can happen and 
Joseph and Mary become es
tranged when he doubts of her 
love and uh ... her innocence.
When released, this film started 
a whole international and reli
gious controversy. The Pope him
self banned the film without even 
seeing it, apparently horrified by 
the mention of a naked Virgin 
Mary and a gloomy Joseph eager 
to check her virginity. As a re
sult, showings of the film are of
ten rare and in some countries it 
only showed years after its origi
nal release. As in most of these 
cases, Hail Mary is not even near 
being a blasphemous film, on 
the contrary it is surprisingly 
religious andit possesses a rather 
serene mood, rare in most Godard 
films. However, fans of Godard 
will be happy to see the jumpcutting and the disregard for 
montage conventions typical of 
Godard (and theres more: if you 
look closely you can see the thenunknown Juliette Binoche in a 
small role as Marys furious ri
val).
Overall, this is a very senti
mental piece and Godard achieves 
some very tender moments like 
young Jesus changing the names 
of his playmates and the recogni
tion game between Mary and her 
son.
The film is also a meditation on 
the coexistence of the body and 
the spirit and Godard links Mary, 
to Nature as a metaphor on her 
transformation from woman to 
mother. He also shows us how 
hard it would be for us to accept a 
miracle and how that makes us 
unable to see the miracles that 
happen everyday.
As usual, Hail Mary will be 
shown with the short film The 
Book of Mary by Anne-Marie 
Mieville (an occasional collabo
rator of Godard). The film deals 
with a different Mary, a very 
unusual young girl estranged by
the divorce of her parents and 
hurt at not being able to let out 
her voice. Through her travelling 
back and forth between her par
ents, Mary also becomes aware of 
the differences between men and 
women and the different ways
keeping it. This theme of faith 
makes The Book of Mary a very 
interesting companion piece for 
Godards film.
Hail Mary and The Book of 
Mary will be showing at Doherty

they view life. The men (or rather 2210 this Thursday, September
man) in this film cant believe in 
anything anymore (well, maybe 
Euclidean geometry) while the 
women are aware of the force of
the spirit and the importance of films.

Blues, folk start off season at Calliope
By JOHN BIGGS
Tartan Diversions Assistant 
Editor
The venues for folk music in 
Pittsburgh are few and far be
tween. Although you might be 
able to catch Arlo Guthrie or one 
of the old masters in a few local 
clubs, there is really nowhere to' 
find hard-driving hooting and 
hollering. Calliope, however, 
hopes to provide that old-fash
ioned folk this season.
The first performer of the sea
son was Rory Block, a blues gui
tarist of high caliber. A partici
pant in W.O.M.A.D., the San 
Francisco Blues Festival, and 
many other outstanding venues, 
her unusual and powerful sing
ing style meshed well with her 
strong guitar stylings.
Although she was a bit preachy 
in her originals, her blues num
bers shone. From the kicking of 
her left legto keep the time to her 
powerful strumming techniques, 
Rory Block was a wonderful per
former full of the spirit of the old 
Delta Blues.
The main star in my mind, 
though, was the opening act, The 
Dancing Demons. These two men,
 ut'at -tR'
Rory Block gave a decent show last weekend at 
Calliope.
Nazeeh Hameed, 73, and Henry 
Belcher, 78, performed about 
thirty minutes of hoofin, or street 
tap dancing.
They ambled on, 
dressed in match
ing red jackets, and 
stole the show with 
their quick move
ments and surpris
ing rhythm and 
agility consider
ing their respective
They cycled 
through a set of tap, 
boogie, and softshoe numbers be
fore hamming it up 
on the encores. A 
joy to watch, the 
duo was a nice 
change of pace.
When asked to 
describe Calliope, 
Les Getchell, Cal
liope spokesperson, 
said that it was the 
principal organi
zation in South
west Pennsylvania
that promotes traditional and 
contemporary folk music.
The organization sponsors the 
Seven Concert Series that brings 
new artists to the area, holds 
classes in folk guitar, dance, and 
other traditional skills, and orga
nizes the Smoky City Folk Festi
val.
This small but visible organi
zation is a great source for music 
and artistry that may be lost in 
todays fast-paced cultural world.
Mr. Getchell also said that We 
think we can build folk music ds 
effectively as the classical music 
organizations have done. We have 
the best line up yet and subscrib
ers in record numbers. It looks 
promising this year.
Calliope has a wide range of 
talent coming to Pittsburgh this 
season, including the Scottish 
songsters The Battlefield Band, 
Irish singers Kate and Anna 
McGarrigle, as well as many other 
traditional performers. Tickets to 
each show are usually $17; more 
information is available by call
ing 687-7713.
