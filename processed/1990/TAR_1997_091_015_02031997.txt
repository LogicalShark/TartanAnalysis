Colleges merge for job fair
By LILIAN LEE
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
For years, the students, faculty, and administra
tors of H&SS (Humanities and Social Sciences) 
and MCS (Mellon College of Science) have dis
cussed the idea of starting a job fair for the stu
dents. This coming Thursday, the idea will become
benefit. Each get the opportunity to learii about the 
others interests and needs. Employers learn about 
the unique skills and talents CMU students have 
to offer, and students learn how their education, 
work, background, and skills fit into the work
place, said Anne Shields, director of the Career 
Center.
There will be 31 companies being represented at
a reality, thanks to the full financial support of the fair, including IBM, United Nations, and Ameri
can Express.
Out of these 31 
companies, 21 
will have representatives 
present at the 
fair and 10 will 
have resume 
drop off boxes. In
terviews may 
a^so scheduled 
with the repre
sentatives for a later date. Each company will have 
their own personal booths and students will be able 
to walk around and pick up brochures and materi
als that will be displayed.
Like the BOC and TOC, the employers are 
asked to pay a certain fee for attending the fair 
which will be donated to local profit and nonPlease see FAIR, page 3
The pairing of H&SS and MCS was a natural 
one. It is common for students in either col
lege to have a double major or minor in the 
other college.

Senate finds excess funds
By MAUREEN MCGRANAGHAN
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Student Senate has recently received notice of 
an $80,000 surplus in this years activities fee, 
resulting from the unanticipated low enrollment 
of the freshman class. In response, Senate, which 
receives the yearly activities funds and then 
allocates them to student organizations, has 
formed a Surplus Commission to collect ideas 
and make recommendations for spending the 
extra money.
Student Body President Bryon Krug, a junior 
in electrical and computer engineering, has as
sembled the commission of 10 students, includ
ing both senators who volunteered and other 
members of the student body. I didnt want to 
have all senators on the commission. I was trying 
to get people who interact with different groups 
of people across campus. Krug said. Keri Mills, 
a sophomore chemical engineering major and a 
member of the commission not involved with 
Senate said, He was trying to get a diverse cross 
section, a broad spectrum.
The commission has three basic purposes, to 
gather ideas from the students and to filter 
through those ideas and try to come up with a 
way to spend this money to benefit students this
year and in years to come, Krug said. With this 
in mind, the commission has developed a strat
egy for encouraging student suggestions. Were 
going to advertise heavily, Brendan Dunham, a 
senior electrical and computer engineering ma
jor, said. Were actually going to have a raffle 
to entice students to make suggestions. The 
commission is not going to be driven by the 
ideas of people on the commission; the actual 
process will be driven by the suggestions of the 
student body.
Dunham, a Student Dormitory Council repre
sentative, got involved partly because of a simi
lar experience in SDC. Several years ago, AT&T 
over-billed campus residents, resulting in an 
excess of $50,000. Of that 50,000, the Student 
Dormitory Council received $35,000, which it 
spent on several smaller projects, including se
nior week, walkie-talkies for EMS, and Festival 
Primavera. Former SDC president Michael 
Sperger, a junior English major, said, SDC 
could have afforded most of the projects they 
paid for with the surplus ACUS funds through 
other means, and SDC missed an opportunity to 
invest in a larger project which they might not 
otherwise have been able to do.

Campus minister dies, 
students mourn loss
By ERIC J. SALZMAN
Tartan Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon flag flew 
at half-staff last Friday in 
memory of the late campus min-. 
ister Salvatore Bruns void. He 
was 36.
Called Sam by those who 
knew him, Brunsvold was shot 
outside his Highland Park home 
at approximately 10:30 pm last 
Tuesday night. He died at Pres
byterian Hospital shortly after 2 
am.
Brunsvold, who was pursuing 
a doctorate in theology at 
Duquesne University, began 
Pittsburghs Christian Student 
Fellowship (CSF) 10 years ago 
out of an office in the New Hope 
Christian Church located on 
North Dithridge Street in Oak
land.
The late minister is survived 
by his wife Sherri and three chil
dren: Justin, 7, Samantha, 5, and 
Luke, 3.
Many students considered 
Brunsvold to be more than just a 
religious leader.
We hit it off pretty quickly, 
said Keith Stitely, CSF president 
and senior physics major, of his
first meeting with Brunsvold. I 
considered Sam to be a close per
sonal friend as well as the cam
pus minister. Stitely said that 
he first met Brunsvold during 
orientation of his freshman year 
at an ice cream social.
Mark Stahlsmith, a senior electrical and computering engineer
ing (ECE) major, also first met 
the minister during that ice
cream social. My first impres
sion was that he was a very spiri
tual man. He took his faith very 
seriously, Stahlsmith said.
Stahlsmith was in charge -of
the programming for Brunsvolds 
Friday night CSF meetings at 
the Cathedral of Learning with 
Carnegie Mellon and Pitt stu
dents. The meetings included 
singing, prayer, and what Stitely 
said was more of a talk then a

The campaign to raise the capital 
needed for the construction of the 
Purnell Center for the Arts has 
yielded $22 million so far, out of the 
estimated goal of $30 million. Ac
cording to a promotional video, the 
groundbreaking ceremony is 
planned for the summer of 1997. 
The Centers completion is the last 
step in the so-called Master Plan 
for capital intensive building 
projects at Carnegie Mellon.
The Purnell Center was designed 
based on input from alumni, ad
ministrators, and architects. The 
leading architect, Michael Dennis, 
is the same one that served in this 
role for the new University Center. 
In fact, Purnell Centers loggia will 
mirror that of the University Cen
ter. In doing so, they will form a 
gateway to the campus on approach 
from Forbes Avenue. Once 
groundbreaking begins, the build
ing will take two years to complete.
According to Jay Carson, Direc
tor of Development for Arts and 
Humanities, the Purnell Center for
the Arts is the long-awaited new 
home of the drama department, 
and will include space for other 
CFA departments as well.
Recently, a $1.5 million gift from 
Regina and Merlin Miller, art 
alumni, established the funds for 
the future art gallery. The Miller 
Gallery will have art exhibitions 
that are jointly programmed with 
the current Hewlett Gallery.
In addition to the art gallery, the 
new Center will include a theater, 
studio theater, TV Studio (currently 
not available on campus), various 
design and dance studios, as well as 
faculty offices. The building will be 
named after alumnus Vemer A. 
Purnell (Art 26) who provided for 
the initial leadership gift for the 
project in his will. The Center will 
be located at the entrance to the 
campus, between Warner Hall and 
the former Navy building. Room 
will be left for expansion of the 
building in a planned second phase 
which calls for the extension ofbuilding out in front of Warner Hall. This 
extension would include faculty of
fices and rehearsal rooms. Carson 
noted that expansion into a new
basement level maybe a possibility 
in the future as well.
The hope for the Purnell Center 
is that we will have space to teach, 
rehearse, and perform that matches 
our world-class drama program, 
said Carson.
In a promotional video distrib
uted to potential donors, Martin 
Prekop, Dean of the College of Fine 
Arts, said, We have been waiting 
30 years for this to happen and 
finally everything is in place. 
Carson said, Its been a longawaited project and Ive been with 
alumni over the last three years 
who have told me that they have 
been waiting for this building liter
ally for decades. According to 
Carson, one of the goals was to 
move some of the units of CFA 
back together. He explained that 
Architecture is currently spread out 
in at least three buildings. Space 
vacated by CFA departments that 
acquire rooms in the new Purnell 
Center will be reallocated within 
the College of Fine Arts.

approximately $8 million, fund raisPlease see PURNELL, page 5

The Purnell Center for the Arts will wrap around Warner Hall and run parallel with the UC.

Chinese vote revokes 
civil liberties decision
BEIJING, Feb. 1 (Reuter)  
The China-appointed commit
tee handling the handover of 
Hong Kong voted on Saturday 
to support Beijings decision to 
roll back civil liberties after the 
British colony returns to Chi
nese rule this year.
Just one of the 150 members 
of the Preparatory Committee 
voted against the motion to 
approve Beijings plans to re
write sections of Hong Kongs 
statute book after it regains 
control of the colony on July 1.
A further 10 committee mem
bers abstained from the vote, 
which was held at the close of a 
two-day session in Beijing.
I do not agree with the abol
ishing of some ofthe ordinances, 
which include the Bill of Rights 
ordinances and the public or
der ordinance, said Frederick 
Fung, chairman of the Hong 
Kong Association for Democracy 
and Peoples Livelihood, who cast 
the sole dissenting vote.
They were talking about 
striking out the laws, which I 
could not agree to because I 
could not find anything that is 
contradictory to the Basic Law, 
said Allen Lee, chairman of the 
pro-China, pro-business Lib
eral Party, who abstained.
China says its Basic Law, a 
mini-constitution for Hong 
Kong, will fully protect the 
colonys future autonomy and 
its residents political and 
civil rights.
Beijings plans to repeal or 
amend 25 of Hong Kongs laws 
and ordinances, including 
parts of the Bill of Rights as 
well as regulations on public 
assembly, have prompted pro
tests from Britain and democ
racy activists in the colony.
Hong Kong Governor Chris 
Patten slammed the plan on 
Thursday as a repugnant pro
posal to dilute the territorys 
civil liberties.
China has defended the 
move, accusing Western me
dia of distorting the nature of 
the proposed changes and say
ing that only those provisions 
that contradict laws dealing 
with international affairs or na
tional defense will be removed.
Hong Kongs post-colonial 
leader Tung Chee-hwa, who is 
attending the crucial commit
tee meetingin Beijing, has sup
ported Beijing, saying the in
ternational community has 
misconstrued the situation.
Following the Preparatory 
Committees motion to recom
mend Beijings planned legal 
changes for the colony, the pro
posals would now go to Chinas 
National Peoples Congress for 
a final decision, Tung said but 
gave no timetable.
Some of the 25 laws and ar
ticles set to be repealed or al
tered include some that are the 
product of recent British-led 
reforms, while others are the 
trappings of the colonial era.
Economists oppose 
amendment plans
WASHINGTON, Jan. 31 
(Reuter)Morethanl ,000economists, including 11 Nobel prize 
winners, have condemned a pro
posed constitutional balanced 
budget amendment and warned 
Congress it could make recovery 
from recessions difficult.
At a Capitol Hill news confer
ence Thursday, Nobel laureate 
James Tobin said a ban on deficit 
spending would aggravate a re
cession and could push the coun
try into a depression. It would 
require the government to in
crease taxes or cut expenditures 
just at the wrong time, he said.
The statement signed by 1,060 
economists said, We condemn 
.the proposed "balanced budget*
amendment to the federal Con
stitution. It is unsound and un
necessary.
Because tax revenues fall dur
ing an economic downturn, the 
government would not be able to 
meet the need for greater unem
ployment payments and welfare, 
Tobin said. These programs help 
buffer the impact of a downturn 
by keeping consumer spending 
up, he said.
The economists also warned 
that a balanced budget require
ment would also prevent the gov
ernment from borrowing money 
to pay for needed infrastructure, 
education, research and develop
ment, and environmental pro
tection.

Bomb suspect files libel case
ATLANTA, Jan. 28 (Reuter)  
Former Olympic bombing suspect 
Richard Jewell reached a settle
ment with CNN on Tuesday and 
opened a libel battle with the 
publisher ofth e Atlanta JournalConstitution, his attorneys said.
The Cox-owned Journal-Constitution was the first to identify 
the 34-year-old Jewell as a sus
pect in the bombing, which came 
at the height of the Atlanta Olym
pic Games. He was cleared by the 
Justice Department in October 
and accused the media and FBI 
of almost destroying his life dur
ing 88 days of hell.
Roger Kintzel, publisher of the 
Journal-Constitution, said the 
newspaper was sympathetic to 
the ordeal of Jewell and his 
mother. But the publication stood 
by its staff and their coverage of 
the story.
The suit contends statements 
by Piedmonts president Ray 
Cleere, as published by the Journal-Constitution, damaged 
Jewells reputation by alleging 
that he matched the FBIs profile 
of a lone bomber.
Jewell also was critical of com
ments made about him on the 
Oct. 28 edition of the CNN cur
rent affairs program, Crossfire.
U.S. economic growth surged
WASHINGTON, Jan. 31 
(Reuter)The economy snapped 
back and grew at the fastest pace 
in 2-1/2 years in the fourth quar
ter, the government said Friday, 
as consumer spending and exports 
surged without firing up inflation.
The nations gross domestic 
product grew at a surprisingly 
strong 4.7 percent annual rate in 
the quarter, more than double 
the 2.1 percent rate in the third 
quarter, the Commerce Depart
ment said.
Despite the pickup in growth, 
price rises were the smallest in
30 years as the economy showed 
few signs of overheating that 
might push the Federal Reserve
into raising interest rates soon in 
a bid to ward off inflation.
Its in many ways an economy 
that is a picture of perfection, 
said Robert Dederick, economic 
consultant to Northern Trust Co. 
in Chicago. He said the jump in 
growth was unlikely to be re
peated in the current quarter.
We have an economy that is 
growing at a pace that is unsus
tainable on a long-term basis, 
Dederick said, though so far it 
has not shown signs of generat
ing excesses.
The economy has been growing 
steadily since the last recession 
ended in March 1991 and will 
complete its sixth year of expan
sion if growth continues into the 
second quarter.
AL appeals gay rights in court
ATLANTA, Jan. 28 (UPI)  
The state of Alabama is asking a 
federal appeals court to let it 
refuse to give state funds to col
lege and university groups that 
promote homosexuality.
Alabama Assistant Attorney 
General Tom Parker told the 11 th 
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals 
Tuesday that the state should 
not have to finance groups that 
foster or promote violation of the 
states sodomy and sexual mis
conduct laws.
A1992 law denied public funds 
or facilities for any college or uni
versity group that encourages 
members or others to engage in 
any such unlawful acts.
U.S. District Judge Myron Th
ompson struck down the law in 
January 1996 as naked view
point discrimination.
Parker told the three-judge fed
eral appeals panel the court ruled 
prematurely. He said, This is 
not protected First Amendment 
speech when youre advocating 
the violation of a criminal stat
ute.
Matt Coles, director of the 
American Civil Liberties Unions 
Lesbian and Gay Rights Project, 
told the judges the law is uncon
stitutional under the First 
Amendment ... and should not 
remain on the books.
The ACLU challenge.d the law 
on behalf of the Gay Lesbian Bi
sexual Alliance at the University 
of South Alabama in Mobile.
Coles said the law was clearly 
designed to silence groups whose 
viewpoint does not agree with 
the government. He said it will 
have an inhibiting effect on the 
free speech of other individuals if 
it remains on the books.
School accepts 
Caged Bird
WEST CHESTER, Ohio, Jan.
31 (UPI)  The Lakota Board 
of Education has compromised 
concerning parents complaints 
about poet Maya Angelous au
tobiography I Know Why the 
Caged Bird Sings  removing 
the book from a sophomore col
lege-preparatory reading list, 
while allowing students to read 
the book in the school library.
The board Thursday night re
acted to complaints from the par
ents of five students about al
leged lesbian themes, a descrip
tion of Angelous teenage preg
nancy and what the parents said 
was a generally negative view of 
men in the 1969 book.
Board President Sandy 
Wheatley, who voted against the 
removal, told the residents, If 
this is the first, what will be next?
Angelou, a world-reknowned 
poet, spoke at President Clintons 
1993 inauguration.
Judge appoints lawyer to fetus
SOMERVILLE, N.J., Jan. 30 
(Reuter) A New Jersey judge, 
weighing the case of a jailed 
pregnant woman seeking an 
abortion, has ruled that the fe
tus has a right to an attorney, 
lawyers said Thursday.
Superior Court Judge Leonard 
Arnold appointed a lawyer to rep
resent the 5-month-old fetus of 
Sonya Jackson, who is being held 
in the Somerset County, New 
Jersey, jail on drug charges.
Jackson has asked for a bail 
reduction to enable her to obtain 
an abortion.
I have decided that the unborn 
child requires representation,! 
the judge said in his ruling on 
Wednesday. He also suggested 
that the woman would need state 
permission to end her pregnancy.
Susan Atwood, president of the 
New Jersey chapter of the Na
tional Organization for Women 
said Thursday that the judge wason shaky legal ground.
New Jersey doesnt have a law 
restricting abortion, she said. I I 
am concerned that this woman is1 
being denied her constitutional' 
rights by the judge.
Jackson, 33, was arrested on 
Jan. 7 on charges of selling heroin 
worth $200 to an undercover po
lice officer in Bernards Township, 
New Jersey, according to court 
documents. She is being held on 
$35,000 bail.
Licorice safe to eat, not smoke
BOSTON, Jan. 31 (Reuter)  
Licorice, honey and cocoa, all com
mon foodstuffs, are also common 
cigarette flavorings, and anti
smoking advocates said Friday; 
that while those things are safe, 
to eat, they are toxic when burned 
and inhaled.
The hearings are part of a 
process to design regulations 
that will require all companies 
that sell cigarettes and smoke
less tobacco in Massachusetts 
to disclose the ingredients by 
brand by July 1.
Four tobacco firms, Philip Mor
ris Cos. Inc., R.J. Reynolds To
bacco Co., Brown & Williamson 
Tobacco Corp. and Lorillard To
bacco Co. are suing in federal 
court to have the state law de
clared unconstitutional, arguing 
in part, it would force them to 
reveal trade secrets.
During the hearing, several 
witnesses testified that flavor-' 
ings used in foods as well as 
sweetners that are usually con
sumed on their own, including 
licorice, honey and cocoa, are 
carcinogens when burned and 
inhaled.
Honey is number 273 on a list 
of599 tobacco addictives thatthe 
industry released in 1994.
Justice Department admits FBI lab problems
WASHINGTON, Jan. 30 
(Reuter) - A top Justice Depart
ment official acknowledged 
Thursday that an internal inves
tigation has turned up serious 
problems at the FBIs beleaguered 
crime laboratory.
But Deputy Attorney General 
Jamie Gorelick expressed confi
dence in the scientific work per
formed at the forensic unit, which 
has come under criticism in a 
still-secret inquiry by the Justice 
Departments inspector general.
She rejected the view that the 
problems at the laboratory may 
jeopardize high-profile criminal 
cases, sayingthe department took 
steps during the past year to make 
sure that prosecutions survive 
any legal challenge.
We do believe that this is a 
serious set of problems that have 
been addressed, she said, add
ing that the draft report on the 
investigation raised some sub
stantial questions.
At the weekly departmental 
briefing, Gorelick said: We be
lieve that we have taken appro
priate steps to preserve the in
tegrity of our cases and we have 
every confidence that in the end 
everyone will get a fair trial.
Gorelick declined to detail the 
problems revealed by the investi
gation, which was assisted by an 
outside panel of international 
scientific experts.
But other Justice Department 
and FBI officials said the report 
sharply criticized the laboratory 
for poor management practices and 
sloppy handling of evidence. It 
raised questions about FBI proce
dures and contaminated evidence.
The officials declined comment 
on a Los Angeles Times report 
that laboratory officials were 
pressured by agents to lie about 
their findings and that their con
clusions sometimes were changed
by supervisors to support crimi
nal prosecutions.
The laboratory, controversy 
erupted this week after the FBI 
announced it had removed four 
officials from the unit in response 
to the investigation, including a 
whistleblower whose initial com
plaints triggered the inquiry.
The FBI denied it suspended 
agent Frederic Whitehurst in 
retaliation for his complaints. 
He has alleged scientific fraud, 
misconduct, gross negligence 
and slanting of evidence to fa
vor prosecutors.
The FBI transferred to other 
jobs James Thurman, chief of the 
explosives unit, Dave Williams, a 
supervisory agent in the unit, and 
Roger Martz, chief of a chemistry 
and toxicology unit.
Pressed on whether she still 
had confidence in the integrity of 
the tests performed at the labo
ratory, Gorelick said, In general,
we have confidence in the lab. 
There are some problems thathave 
emerged through this report.
The laboratory has played a 
key role in various FBI investiga
tions, including the Unabomber 
case and the investigation into the 
1995 Oklahoma City bombing.
Whitehurst is expected to ap
pear as a defense witness at the 
trial for Oklahoma City bombing 
suspect Timothy McVeigh. He 
testified at the World Trade Cen
ter bombing case for the defense 
and submitted a deposition in the 
O.J. Simpson murder trial that 
was critical of the FBI
Gorelick said the inspector 
generals report still is being re-; 
viewed, with facts being checked 
on a case-by-case basis, but 
added the reports basic; 
premise would not change.
Justice Department officials, 
expect the report to be 
in March.

The Surplus Commission met for 
the first time on Monday, January 27. 
Matt Phelps, a sophomore in electri
cal and computer engineering and a 
former Senator, said, The majority of 
that meeting was spent on how to get 
feedback from the students. We were 
trying to come up with creative ideas 
to let people know because we think if 
they know about it, theyll be inter
ested. According to Krug, the com
mission will only meet a total of three 
to four times. The real work of the 
commission doesnt need to take place 
in meetings. The bulk of the work will 
be in gathering suggestions, not com
ing up with our own. he said.
The preliminary ideas they 
brainstormed last Monday include im
provements to Skibo Coffeehouse, the 
development of a public space for stu
dents, a contribution to putting a 
35mm film projector in McConomy, 
and an increase in exercise equip
ment, but between now and February 
20, when the commission will make 
preliminary recommendations to the 
Senate, all students are invited to 
contribute suggestions. Phelps is con
fident people will respond. I have 
freshmen on my floor, and they always 
have ideas for improvement. You cant 
please everyone... were going to make 
the biggest improvement we can with 
the money thats been allotted.

Secretary of Defense condemns corp ritual
WASHINGTON, Jan. 31 (Reuter)  
Defense Secretary William Cohen Fri
day condemned incidents in which U.S. 
Marine trainees had medals pounded 
into their chests and said he would 
enforce a zero tolerance policy for 
such brutality.
I am disturbed and disgusted by the 
treatment of young Marines in the haz
ing incident, Cohen said at his first 
Pentagon news conference as newly 
confirmed U.S. defense secretary. He 
referred to bloody training rituals in
volving Marine trainees in 1991 and 
1993, films of which were leaked to 
television networks and aired on Fri
day.
Abuse such as this has no place in 
any branch of the United States mili
tary, Cohen said. ... You can be sure 
that I intend to enforce a strict policy of
zero tolerance of hazing, of sexual harass
ment and of racism.
Cohen said he understood there had 
been about 80 incidents of such hazing 
uncovered in the Marine Corps in the 
past three to five years, although it re
mained to be determined how widespread 
such practices were in the U.S. military. 
Gen. John Shalikashvili, chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff who joined Cohen, 
added: One incident is too many.
The broadcast newsfilm showed Ma
rines writhing and crying out in pain as 
others pounded the spiked medals into 
their chests through t-shirts. Cohen said 
high-pressure training designed to 
toughen recruits and weld them into a 
fighting forces can cross the line into this 
type of abuse and that cannot be con
doned. He and Shalikashvili promised 
the incidents would be fully investigated.

30 minute discussion on topics rel
evant to college students like dating 
and handling stress.
Average attendance at the meet
ings this year had been about 40 
students according to Brian 
Humensky, who graduated this past 
December with a degree in physics. 
Humensky is the coordinator for the 
tutoring program at Schenley High 
School started by Brunsvold last fall. 
He was very concerned about meet
ing our needs and helping us to grow, 
Humensky said.
Brunsvolds colleagues also ex
pressed their respect for him. Sister 
Bernadette Young who has been at 
CMU for 22 years said, He was a

very bright, intelligent man ... [who 
believed] in charity toward all. Fa
ther Bryan Summers of the Ryan 
Catholic Newman Center attested 
to Brunsvolds devotion to his work. 
His primary goal would be to wit
ness to the teachings of Christ, Sum
mers said.
Although currently not speaking to 
the press, Brunsvolds wife released a 
statement thanking the community 
for the support it has shown during 
this difficult time for her family.
On Friday night, Stitely, 
Stahlsmith, and other student CSF 
leaders continued the weekly meet
ings. The usual activities were substi
tuted with discussion and sharing of 
memories about Brunsvold that these 
students had grown so attached to. 
Visitation was held on Saturday at 
the Freyvogel funeral home and a 
memorial service was scheduled for 7 
pm on Sunday at Pitts William Pitt 
Union. The funeral will be held in 
Brunsvolds home state of Illinois.
With the exception of a charge 
against a scam artist for trying to sell 
false information about the case, Pitts
burgh police have made no arrests in 
connection to the murder. We have
16 officers working the investigation, 
said Sergeant Marraway of the homi
cide department. He said that police 
are questioning anybody and every
body. The police are asking that any
one who may have any information 
about the case to call 665-4050.
Anyone who would like to make a 
donation in honor of Minister 
Brunsvold should send a contribution 
to the New Hope Christian Commu
nity Church at 134 North Dithridge 
Street, Pittsburgh, Pa. 15213.

On March 4, there will be a major benefit 
at the Hilton in Beverly Hills, California. 
Alumni Holly Hunter, John Wells (Pro

President Mehrabian will be honored at 
the benefit for their commitment to the 
Purnell Center project. We expect to
in a publication given to potential bene
factors.
The booklet goes on to list various rooms 
and objects along with the price for which 
they can be named. For instance, $2500 
is the specified contribution for a balcony 
seat in the main theater while the grand 
stair is set at $25,000. Another example

raise a substantial amount of money at 
the event, said Carson.
One strategies being used in the fund
ing of the Purnell Center is the practice of 
naming a room after its benefactor. In 
this booklet we have listed more than 80 
naming opportunities within the new 
Purnell Center. Some of these are taken, 
many remain available, said Martin 
Prekop, dean of the College of Fine Arts,
named after the number one producer 
on television right now, according to 
Carson.
This [method of fund raising] is not 
new. It is just a nice way to do two things
 one is to memorialize someone in your 
family and at the same time to help us to 
bringthe cost of the building, said Carson.
Carson said, We tried to take all of the 
things that we learned [from the Univer
sity Center capital campaign project], 
and we tried to tweak them and tune 
them to make them a little bit better ... 
We think we have a good plan... We have 
sort of taken and subdivided all of the 
different parts of the building [for nam
ing opportunities] ... and there were a 
number of places that were just not inter
esting for people to buy, so we took them 
out.
He cited elevators arid 
restrooms as examples of 
spaces excluded from the nam
ing opportunities booklet arid 
added there is a certain ma
trix of the marketing strategy 
on what we think would sell. 
Carson was enthusiastic 
about the current campaigns 
status saying: I think we really feel 
like we are on a trajectory [in terms 
of raising the needed capital] arid 
people are confident that we are do
ing what we said we were going to do 
... [and] that President Mehrabians 
leadership was really the key to get
ting this accomplished. He has been 
a terrific supporter of the arts at 
Carnegie Mellon.

U.S. criticizes Asia on rights
WASHINGTON, Jan. 30 (Reuter)
 In addition to China, the regions 
most prominent violator, other Asian 
countries committed serious human 
rights abuses last year including 
Burma, Pakistan, India, North Ko
rea, Indonesia and Cambodia, the 
State Department said Thursday. In 
its 20th annual report on human 
rights, the department also said vio
lence against women was a serious 
problem in South Korea, and called 
Vietnams record poor.
The report, on 193 countries, ac
cused China of effectively silencing all 
public dissent against the Communist 
party and government in 1996.
The departments findings on China 
were of keen interest because of U.S. 
efforts to build a better relationship 
with the communist giant. It concluded 
that no dissidents were known to be 
active (in China) at years end.
The report also said severe human 
rights repression by Burmas military 
regime, the State Law and Order Coun
cil (SLORC), increased during 1996, 
even as increased economic activity 
fostered the appearance of greater 
normalcy.
Out of sight of most visitors, citi
zens continued to live subject at any 
time and without appeal to the arbi
trary and sometimes brutal dictates of 
the military dictatorship.
The report faulted the SLORC for 
restricting the democratic opposition, 
the National League for Democracy, 
and its leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, and 
cited credible reports of brutality
and killings of civilians by the military, 
especially in areas dominated by ethnic 
minorities.
After the reports release, the State 
Department issued a separate state
ment deploring attacks by the armed 
forces associated with the SLORC on 
unarmed civilians in three ethnic mi
nority refugee camps in Thailand on 
January 28 and 29. It called on Burma 
to cease its support for repression and 
violence against the ethnic minorities 
and to respect international humani
tarian principles and their obligations 
toward refugees inside of Thailand. 
On Indonesia, the rights report 
seemed tougher than last year, when 
rights advocates faulted Washington 
for placing more value on trade. Assis
tant Secretary of State John Shattuck 
said Indonesias recent crackdown on 
political opposition and labor leaders 
is a matter of great concern.
The report said despite a surface 
adherence to democratic forms, the In
donesian political system remains 
strongly authoritarian.
The government maintained a tight 
grip on the political process and contin
ued to commit serious human rights 
abuses, the report said. In East Timor, 
there were further instances of kill
ings, disappearances, torture and ex
cessive use of force by the military and 
insurgents, it said.
The report found the overall human 
rights situation in Pakistan to be poor, 
despite a public government pledge to 
address problems, especially those of 
women and children.
It said members of the (Pakistani) 
security forces committed numerous 
human rights abuses and there was 
no serious government effort to re
form the police, judicial systems or to 
prosecute those responsible for abuse.
In India, there also continued to be 
significant human rights abuses, de
spite constitutional and statuatory 
safeguards, the report concluded.
Abuses include extrajudicial execu
tions; excessive use of force by security 
forces; torture, rape and deaths of sus
pects in police custody throughout the 
country; poor prison conditions and 
arbitrary arrests and detentions, it 
said.Separatist militants were also re-, 
sponsible for numerous serious abuses, 
the report added. In South Korea, the 
State Department found that violence 
against women.,.especially rape, was a 
serious problem.Women continued to 
face legal and societal discrimination. 
Violence against women and physical 
abuse remain serious problems and 
may have worsened in recent years, 
the rights report said. The report 
faulted Vietnam for continuing to re
press basic political and some reli
gious freedoms and to commit nu
merous abuses. It said both Buddhists; 
and Christians in the country suffered 
from government restrictions.
Cambodia also had numerous hu
man rights abuses in 1996. As it does 
annually, the report faulted North 
Korea in every category, saying the 
Stalinist government in Pyongyang 
continues to deny its citizens human 
rights.

FORUM
Carnegie Mellon University3 February 1997
Senate should spend 
new funds wisely
In 1993, the ACUS Service of 
AT&T overcharged students for 
long-distance phone calls by 
$30,000. Instead of cutting re
imbursement checks to indi
vidual students for 5 to 10 cents 
each, ACUS returned one lump 
sum of money to the University, 
which was distributed to Stu
dent Senate, Greek Council and 
the Student Dormitory Coun
cil.
SDC was allocated $28,500 of 
the money which was then funneled out to groups for small 
projects or one-time events; no 
long-term improvements or ad
ditions were made. Student Sen
ate now faces the same dilemma 
 having to put unanticipated 
funds to good use.
In this current fiscal year, Stu
dent Senate overbudgeted fund
ing by approximately $80,000 
as a result of accounting errors. 
Members of Student Senate 
with the help of the Presiden
tial Campus Improvement Com
mission, are holding a campuswide contest soliciting sugges
tions for possible expenditures.
So far, ideas such as renovat
ing Skibo Coffeehouse and rec
reating Scotland Yard have been 
suggested. Other suggestions 
have included an indoor track, 
a computer cluster in the UC, or 
the purchase of two vans for 
student organizations to use for 
off-campus events. Senate 
might even entertain the idea of 
purchasing a franchise or
resturant chain to increase food 
quality and lower prices in the 
UC.
Constructing new facilities or 
renovating those that are in 
need of improvement would be 
the best direction for the money, 
rather then re-allocating por
tions of the sum to organiza
tions that were underfunded at 
the beginning of the year or who 
currently need more funding.
While Senate should be com
mended for seeking student in
put on spending plans for the 
$80,000, it should also be 
pointed out that there is some 
urgency in deciding on how to 
spend the money. There is no 
advantage for Senate to take 
their time past this fiscal year 
to spend the money or even to 
try and invest tit, for it will only 
be rolled back into University 
accounts come July 31 and never 
to be seen again.
With another $500,000 on the 
way for the next school years 
expenditures, Senate should 
spend the excess quickly on a 
capital project that would re
ally add to campus facilities. 
Rather than re-allocating small 
funds to individual groups for 
one time events, Senate should 
think about the long-terms ef
fects of its spending. With new 
money coming in next year this 
money will depreciate in value 
if it isnt spent now; there is no 
cost advantage to saving the 
money for future plans.
Wristband policy must 
be enforced in UC
While CMU students, staff, 
and faculty are required to show 
proper identification in order to 
use the gym and weight room in 
the University Center this policy 
is generally overlooked  nonCMU affiliates use the facilities 
as well, which has resulted in 
overcrowding and a misuse of 
resources.
Students, faculty, and staff are 
limited to one guest per visit, 
yet the number ofnon-CMU stu
dents found in one of these fa
cilities at any given time ex
ceeds this restriction.
High school students, some of 
whom are under the age of 16, 
are often found using the bas
ketball courts and weightrooms. 
Although the building is in
tended for community use, hav
ing underage students in these 
facilities is a liability  most 
gyms have a common underage 
limit to ensure a safe environ
ment. CMU resources are in
tended to be used by those that 
are a part of the campus com
munity; they were designed to 
hold only a certain number of 
people. By allowing non-CMU 
students to use this space, le
gitimate patrons are shafted out 
of adequate resources that are 
entitled to them. This is demon
strated by the increasingly long 
waits for exercise and weight

Letter to
Editor,
I read with great in
terest J ames Stepaneks 
column on greed 
(Writer finds goodness the Editor 
in greed,1/20). Greed 
must be distinguished from the profit 
motive. Mr. Stepaneks article refers to 
the profit motive, which in most cases is 
healthy. Out of control greed is not. I am 
not one of those persons who presumes 
to tell someone how much money he or 
she may make; anyone who provides a 
good or service of value to someone else 
has the right to charge whatever the 
market will bear.
While it is true that one can be greedy 
and principledlook at Warren Buffett 
in fact, many people who Mr. Stepanek 
might refer to as greedy dont give a 
damn about principle.
Mr. Stepaneks piece does not address 
how far our mixture of big government 
and capitalism is supposed to take us. It 
is becoming harder for people to keep 
their money. The middle class in America 
is shrinking.
Recently, IBM approved health ben
efits for same-sex couples. Not much
principle in that, is there? Big busi
ness often sells out to the prevailing 
lack of ethic.

Letter to the Editor
Editor,
It is an indisputable 
fact that the pro-life 
movement is the most 
peaceful grassroots so
cial movement in the his
tory of this country, yet our national 
media affiliates insist on focusing atten
tion on a few radicals who advocate 
violence, which all national pro-life 
groups have roundly condemned.
Take the news coverage of the Right to 
Life March: Was National Right to Life, 
the official spokesperson for over 3,000 
pro-life affiliates, quoted? Did the me
dia interview the really interesting 
groups at the march, such as Feminists 
for Life, Libertarians for Life, Gays and 
Lesbians for Life? No. Half of the tele
vised coverage of the pro-life side was of
some nut who joined the march at the 
last minute and sputtered something 
unintelligible about violent response.
Lets focus on the issues, people.
Then there was the story about a bomb 
scare at the March for Life, but it turned 
out to be a harmless firecracker-strength 
cap found outside a building. That little 
tidbit worked itself into every story that 
day on the events in D.C.
Isnt this a little one-sided? Fanatics 
get attracted to both sides of important 
social issues.
The ACLU has logged over 600 reports 
of violence against pro-life persons and 
establishments in Los Angeles alone, 
but do we ever hear about this?
Finally, isnt the central controversy 
being lost in all this media focus? The 
abortion debate is not about violence 
or the lunatic fringe. Its about choices. 
My pro-choice friends and I get along, 
we talk, and maybe we can even have 
some ongoing dialogue, but not if the 
national media insists on polarizing us.

machines on the second floor, 
raquetball courts being reserved 
from opening to closing each

A system was originally set 
up to enforce the affiliate usage 
policy  wristbands were to be 
worn by those having a valid 
CMU ID while using gym facili
ties and equipment. This pro
cedure has proven to be insuffi
cient due in part to the fact that 
it is not strictly enforced, subse
quently very few people actu
ally wear the wristbands.
This identification system 
would work to keep non-CMU 
users away, but only if it is 
strongly enforced. An hourly pa
trol should be implemented in 
order to discourage others from 
entering UC facilities. All mem
bers of the CMU community are 
entitled to use the resources in 
the UC but this should not neces
sarily extend to entire families of 
CMU affiliates, especially if space 
and resources are not available 
to CMU students.
In order to save money on 
equipment repairs and build
ing maintenance in the future 
and provide adequate facilities 
to students, faculty and staff, 
the administration needs to re
think its present process for 
regulating visitors.
CMU should prepare students for life

Imagine that you 
are holding the ul
timate RAD formin 
your hand  with 
a scribble in the 
right box and your 
signature, you can
add and drop courses at will. Want to get nine units credit for 
watching World Championship Wrestling every week? No

it from the curriculum forever, and confuse a whole lot of 
people who show up at 8:30 Monday morning for a class that 
no longer exists.
They say absolute power corrupts absolutely, and putting 
the mother of all RAD forms in your mitts would illustrate 
the clich beautifully. Admit ityou would be lounging in 
your room with a quart of Ben and Jerrys and General 
Hospital on the television,
that we simply cannot predict beforehand. Some of those 
turns result in great success, and others bring about 
smashing failure. Learn from it all, we are told. It doesnt 
matter if you fall down so much as it matters if you get up 
again. Sounds good in theory, but does this school pre
pare us to deal with failure?
A junior creative writing major wrote me and said, 
They say if you dont know history, youre doomed to 
repeat it. So why not teach us the stuff we really have to 
make sure we dont repeat? Have a class on the Worlds 
Great Screwups. He included a fist of suggestions, 
ranging from the smokeless ashtray to New Coke to the 
movie Ishtar.
Though the suggestion was partly in jest, the underly

sense. Carnegie Mellon students, in general, do not 
appear to take risks veiy well.

Who needs real courses? Col

fun should be worth something. Even if we never get access to that iiber-RAD, we 
should consider throughout our time here whether or not we 
are receiving a complete education from Carnegie Mellon. If 
you have ever attended Winter Orientation or Slice of Life, 
you have heard from people on the outside that arcane 
technical skills alone will not suffice in the rugby scrum that 
passes for a job market these days. Todays companies want 
employees who can play well with the other kids, and who can 
cope with shifting environments and changing organizations.
The demands of the corporate world beyond our campus, 
indeed, motivated a student in the IM department to address 
the problem by creating a class. EmmaGosden, who has since 
graduated and moved on to greener pastures, convinced 
administrators to offer an Interpersonal Communications 
class to all students. The course, offered through the IM

that should be taught to all students, including relax

Students recommended making their course a univer

live without forced trips to Metropol, but we should 
consider expanding some of the topics covered during

full one-semester courses.
We could learn about risk taking, about leadership, 
and even about commonplace things like managing

President Mehrabian has reportedly said that the class

them prepare for corporate life. I agree with the sentiment of 
his statement  though not exactly for his reason.
There exist several gaps in the education CMU offers its 
students, and not all of them concern proper office behavior.

Columnists debate over same-sex marriages
Issue goes above moral bounds
Ellen Beldner
In the 1961 Supreme Court case 
Griswold, vs. Connecticut, Justice William 
0. Douglas authored the oft-applied prin
ciple that a governmental purpose to 
control or prevent activities constitution
ally subject to state regulation may not be 
achieved by means which sweep unneces
sarily broadly and thereby invade the 
area of protected freedoms.
Douglas continued in his opinion: We 
deal with a right of privacy older than 
the Bill of Rights, older than our politi
cal parties, older than our school sys
tem. Marriage is a coming together for 
better or for worse, hopefully enduring, 
and intimate to the degree of being sa
cred. Does this apply any less to samesex couples?
Most Americans, 75 percent, take a 
tolerant view of legalized gay marriage. 
A common moral tenet? It looks that 
way. But the difference between any 
perceived immorality of gay and lesbian 
marriage and the generally accepted 
immorality of, say, adultery lies in one 
crucial element: personal privacy.
Adultery is illegal because it is a 
breach of contract. The guilty spouse and 
his or her accomplice injure an innocent 
third party through their actions.
Gay marriage, however, is illegal be
cause non-involved parties simply find it 
offensive. That view is each 
individuals prerogative, for no one 
can or should dictate anothers per
sonal tastes and preferences.
And therein lies the flaw in not allowing 
gays and lesbians to marry. The assump
tion that the majoritys opinion forms a 
categorical imperative, allowing it to dic
tate the boundaries of homosexual rela
tionships, contradicts several fundamen
tal legal premises of the American jus
tice system. The law has been, and is 
currently, used as a tool to force'the 
majoritys morality on a minority which
does not share that view of morality.
Many states, including California, 
Florida, South Carolina, and Hawaii, 
have stated right-to-privacy clauses in 
their state constitutions.
The Hawaii First Circuit Court re
cently ruled that gay marriage cannot 
be prohibited in states with right-toprivacy guarantees.
Marriage is a form of legal protection 
for a highly committed personal rela
tionship. When the government says 
that a relation
ship may not be 
legally protected 
because of the 
couples gender, 
it violates the 
equal protection 
clause of the 
Fourteenth 
Amendment.
This is why gay 
marriages must 
be made legal.
A personal 
opinion does not 
provide justifica
tion for denying 
personal privacy 
and constitu
tional rights to 
our citizens.
If people dont 
like or approve 
of gay marriage, 
so be it. Let 
them disap
prove; let them 
keep their chil
dren from being 
exposed to a dif
ferent type of 
lifestyle. But we 
cannot, in a free

society, condone the subversion of 
our legal traditions and values to the 
majoritys personal prejudices.
Ellen Beldner is a freshman in the 
University Choice Program, and the 
Tartan Assistant News Editor. She 
welcomes any responsible replies to 
her column.
Im not sure I understand the furor 
over gay marriage. As I see it, gays have 
the same right to get married, as do the 
straight folk. The barrier is that they have to 
marry someone of 
the opposite sex.
Marriage has a 
simple cultural 
origin: It is the 
basic economic 
and social unit of 
the family, and 
has been sanc
tioned for the 
purpose of rais
ing children. 
Now, anyone 
with a very basic 
understanding of 
biology would re
alize that a samesex couple is 
rather unlikely to 
produce children; 
thus the primary 
reason for mar
riage is ne
glected. Even in 
ancient Greece, 
where homosexu
ality was the so
cial norm, there 
were no same-sex 
marriages.
People under
stood that mar
riage was about 
families, while same-sex couples were 
about sex.
Of course, it is true that not all married 
couples produce children.
Also there will be those who say that 
some same-sex couples do have children, 
but thats a very small portion of an 
already small minority.
Neither of these arguments is more
Anthony Chao/Tartan Photo Editor
than a hand-waving gesture, and both 
ignore the simple fact that marriage is 
about families.
There are basically two reasons for 
gays wanting the ability to marry. The 
first is simple: acceptance. They want 
society to go well beyond tolerance and 
into the realm of seeing homosexual 
couples as being just as normal as het
erosexual couples.
Lets be honest herethis isnt going to 
happen (any time soon, at least), and 
trying to force the issue via government 
fiat is not likely to change peoples minds.
The other real reason is that they 
want their share of the goodies.
It has become reasonably economical 
for a company to offer spousal benefits 
via tax breaks. Given that an individual 
has a hard time affording many of these 
perks without the tax breaks that com
panies get, gays are trying to find a way 
to get a hold of those benefits.
Lets face it  if a gay man can 
marry his lover so that the lover gets 
benefits from his company, why cant 
I marry some buddy of mine whom I 
room with, but dont sleep with, for 
those same benefits?
Corporate perks arent the only thing 
gays seem to be seeking. There are also 
issues of inheritance, and other legal rami
fications such as guardianships.
But remember, these were designed 
by society for the benefit of families, not 
for convenience.
With a good lawyer, most of these 
things can be duplicated through the 
use of legal instruments such as wills 
and power of attorney.
The simple truth of the matter is that 
same-sex marriage is just a another shot 
by the left to pervert an institution 
that they have already left reeling 
(look at the divorce rates following 
no-fault divorce laws).
It is just a grab at goodies and social 
acceptance, and should be treated with 
disdain by the courts.

Writer finds charges against Gingrich unfair, hypocritical
James Stepanek
The latest thing swamping the 
news has been the ethics charges 
against Speaker of the House 
Newt Gingrich. A fair amount of 
every news article has gone into 
how he admitted guilt, and how 
the Republicans on the Ethics 
committee have been shielding 
him. However, it seems like there 
has been almost no discussion of 
what the charges are all about. 
There is a simple reason for this 
they are a load of hooey.
Let me explain what Newt did. 
First of all, he taught a college 
course using tax-exempt dona
tions. He used funds that were 
donated to a tax-exempt founda
tion, to pay for a college course he
taught at Kennesaw State Col
lege in Georgia. The act is an 
ethics violation because the 
course was allegedly partisan. 
However, try to picture any of the 
history courses youve taken not 
being described as partisan by 
someone who disagreed with the 
teachers views.
So this was the big crime, teach
ing a course that some found to be 
partisan. He then did one other 
thing which has Democrats in 
violent fits  his lawyer submit
ted a document that contained 
some incorrect information to the 
Ethics Committee.
This was only one of three docu
ments on the same topic, and the 
other two were correct.
Also, the lawyer made the er
ror, not Gingrich.
The lawyer has admitted that 
it was his error (something of a 
danger since thats admitting to
malpractice), and stated 
that Gingrich had given orders 
for the lawyer to be as forthright 
and cooperative as possible.
Yep, that is the sum total of the 
charges. Gingrich taught a course 
that some say was partisan.
Then his lawyer screwed up 
documenting this. None of these 
offenses is even so much as a 
misdemeanor. The IRS hasnt 
even expressed interest in the 
supposed tax violations.
If it werent for the constant 
hammering on the topic by con
gressional Democrats and the 
press, it would have been left in 
the obscurity that it deserves.
Of course, the people who were 
rabidly after Gingrich, Rep. 
James McDermott (D-Washington), in particular, dont seem to 
care much about laws when they 
get going. A couple of weeks ago, 
the transcript of a cellular phone
call between Gingrich and his 
lawyers was printed in The New 
York Times.
Later, a couple from Florida 
came forward and claimed that 
they had recorded this conversa
tion using a police scanner that 
they had recently purchased.
They had seen to it that 
McDermott of the Ethics Com
mittee got a hold of this tape. An 
excited McDermott offered the 
tape to the committee chairman, 
Nancy Johnson, who, under
standing the law, refused it. You 
see, the act of recording a cellular 
phone message is a felony, as is 
passing along the tape and re
ceiving it. Thus McDermott, in 
his zeal to prosecute Gingrich for 
less than a misdemeanor, has 
(allegedly) committed a felony. I 
wonder why the presshasntbothered hounding McDermott out of 
office yet.
The Gingrich ethics charges 
have been sorted out and a pun
ishment laid down.
He was given a reprimand and 
a $300,000 fine. This is a harsh 
punishment considering the na
ture of the violation, but the 
House Republicans would have 
been skinned alive by the press if 
he received anything more ap
propriate to what he had done. 
Luckily, there is an ongoing in
vestigation of the tapes, tran
scripts, and the involvement of 
McDermott and other House 
Democrats in the blatant viola
tion of federal privacy laws. It 
could be that there is a much 
more proper resolution waiting 
in the wings.
James Stepanek is a Ph.D. can
didate in material science engi
neering. He welcomes any respon
sible replies to his column.
The question of whether 
gays should be allowed to 
legally marry is currently a 
hot topic of debate. We asked 
students: Do you think that 
gays should have the 
right to marry?

115-71.
Belowich said, The women are 
on a roll. Before Fairmont State, 
the team had won three out of 
their last four dual meets, finish
ing the season with a record of 5- 
7. I dont know the history, said 
Belowich. I dont know how many 
years they have won five meets  I dont 
think very many.
The men also had a fabulous perfor
mance, highlighted by a number of season-best times. However, the 
Westminster team controlled the meet 
from the start, and never let CMU near 
the victory. It seems like [the men! got 
hammered, but actually it was really just 
touches ... real close races all the way 
through, Belowich said. In the 200-yard 
medley relay, the team of junior Keith 
Duwel, freshman Chris Hauser, senior 
Chris ORourke, and senior Tony Rippy 
took second place in 1:43.77. In the 1,000- 
yard freestyle, freshmen Eric Melymuk 
andMichael Onofray took third (10:54.56) 
and fourth place (10:54.82), respectively.
A tenth of a second separated junior 
Jake McGuire (second, 1:45.64) from the 
first-place swimmer in the 200-yard 
freestyle, andjuniorMichaelFosterplaced 
fifth (1:52.30) in that event. ORourke 
(fourth, 22.71) and Rippy (fifth, 22.96) 
scored points for the Tartan men in the 50- 
yard freestyle. Freshman Mike Robinson 
took first place (4:27.17) in the 400-yard 
individual medley, and sophomore John 
Murray took fourth (4:38.95). McGuire 
smoked his competition in the 100-yard 
butterfly to claim first place (52.59), and 
freshman Henrik Maxian placed fifth 
(104.74). Foster finished right behind the 
leader to take second place (49.20) in the 
100-yard freestyle, while Rippy took fifth 
(50.69). In the 100-yard backstroke, 
Onofray (third, 58.04) and Duwel (fourth, 
58.39) finished with less than four-tenths 
of a second separating them. Melymuk 
was just edged outinthe 500-yard freestyle 
(second, 5:03.58), while Murray finished 
fifth (5:20.55). In the 100-yard breast
stroke, Hauser (second, 1:03.09), sopho
more Daigo Katagiri (third, 1:06.27), and 
junior David Hall (fourth, 1:06.67) all fin
ished for points. In the final event of the 
meet, CMU dominated the 200-yard relay 
to claim first place with a time of1:27.80. 
The men finished the season 8-4, improv
ing over last years 6-4 finish.
Belowich feels that the team is wellprepared for the competition, that they will 
face in three weeks. Its important to swim 
against good competition throughout the 
dual meet season to prepare for UAAs 
Belowich said. Weve moved forward and 
competed quite well. Belowich says that in 
the next three weeks, the team will taper 
and tune up for championships.

SHORT, from page 12
The Tartans kept it close for 
a while before the Bears ag
gressive play opened up a seven 
point lead with 8:10 remain
ing. Then CMUs zone defense 
seemed to hold Washington in 
check as Carnegie Mellon 
pulled within one point with 
4:40 left on the clock.
However, Washington be
gan to pull away down the 
stretch in spite of some excel
lent freethrow shooting from 
the Tartans. Trendel hit both 
of his freethrows to make it 
80-77 with 23 seconds left. 
CMU quickly put Washing
ton at the line, but they 
drained both shots. The Tar
tans missed a quick 3-point 
shot, but senior guard Rich 
Bodnar picked up the rebound 
and put two points on the 
board for the Tartans.
Down 82-79 with 11 sec
onds left, the Tartans put the 
Bears at the line again, but 
this time, they only picked up 
one point. CMU picked up 
another quick two points. 
However, on the inbound pass, 
Washington found an open 
man breaking down the court, 
and the Tartans were called 
for a flagrant foul as they tried 
to stop him. The call ended
CMUs hopes of another big 
comeback UAA victory.

Niners planning $525 million 
stadium complex
The San Francisco 49ers reportedly 
have unveiled plans for a 75,000-seat 
stadium that would be part of a $525 
million sports and entertainment com
plex at Candlestick Point.
The project would be the most ex
pensive private development in San 
Francisco history, the San Francisco

"It will be the best deal in the NFL 
for what will be the premier facility for 
the premier franchise in the premier 
city," 49ers president Carmen Policy 
told the newspaper.
Kansas still unanimous number
one, Wake Forest, Kentucky 2-3
Kansas rallied for a victory at Texas 
Tech and defeated Nebraska in over
time this past week to remain unbeaten 
and as a result, the unanimous choice 
atop the latest CNN/USA Today col
lege basketball poll released last night.
Kansas (22-0) received all 30 firstplace votes and 750 points from a panel 
of Division I coaches. The Jayhawks 
set a record for the best start in school 
history, eclipsing the 1935-36 squad's 
21-0 record to begin the season.
Wake Forest (18-1), which rallied 
from a 12-point half time deficit to beat 
Maryland Saturday, and Kentucky 
(20-2) remained 2-3 in the USA poll. It 
was believed Kentucky would slide in 
the poll after leading scorer Derek 
Anderson suffered a season-ending 
tom ACL, but the Wildcats are 4-0 
since the injury.

ACC endures, Big East flounders
By Ronak Singhal
Not too long ago people all throughout 
the state of Pennsylvania would argue 
who had the better football team, the 
University of Pittsburgh or Penn State. 
These days, however, there is no ques
tion as PSU has maintained a high stan
dard of excellence, while Pitts program 
has floundered under coaches Fazio, 
Gottfried, Hackett, and Majors.
Similarly, people around the nation 
used to argue which was the better 
college basketball conference, the Big 
East or the Atlantic Coast Conference 
(ACC). The conferences even tried to 
resolve this dispute themselves by play
ing the short-lived Big East-ACC chal
lenge. But lately, there has been no 
dispute over which the better confer
ence has been, as the ACC has moved 
into a class of its own.
This is not to say that the Big East 
has not had regular season suc
cesses of late. Connecticut, 
Georgetown, and Syracuse are pe
rennial top-20 teams, and, usu
ally, at least one of them is in 
the top 10 in the country. How
ever, this regular season suc
cess has not translated into 
the post-season as only two \
Big East teams, both from Syra- \
cuse, have made the finals of the 
NCAA tournament in the last nine 
years. And, of course, both of those 
Syracuse teams lost. This year 
should provide no opportunity for 
the conference to right its ship 
either. Only one conference team, 
Villanova, is ranked in the top 25, 
and their tepid play of late is not 
exactly awe-inspiring.
The ACC, on the other hand, 
uses the NCAA tournament as 
a showcase for its best players
and teams. Three of the last six NCAA 
champions have been from the ACC 
and this year the chances of another 
ACC national champ are extremely 
high. Three ACC teams, Wake Forest, 
Maryland, and Clemson, are ranked in 
the top 10, while perennial powers North 
Carolina and Duke are also lurking in 
the top 25.
So, what has caused the two confer
ences to take these wildly divergent paths? 
Fans of the Big East will argue that the 
conference is hurt every year by having 
its young players leave school early for 
the NCAA. Last year, the conference lost 
its two marquee players, Ray Allen and 
Allen Iverson, even though one was a 
junior and the other was only a sopho
more. But this excuse is just that  an 
excuse. The ACC has been hit just as 
hard, if not harder, by players leaving 
early. Some recent names include Joe 
Smith, Rasheed Wallace, and Jerry 
Stackhouse. Imagine Maryland or 
North Carolina
this year if they still had 
these players.
One big difference is the re
cruiting style of the two confer
ences. Big East teams seldom look 
outside the East Coast for play
ers. The exception to this is Connecticuts 
penchant for acquiring mature Israeli 
players. Look at the rosters of ACC 
teams. At Wake Forest, you have Ricardo 
Peral from Spain and Tim Duncan from 
the Virgin Islands. At North Carolina, 
there is Serge Zwikker among others on 
the team from Europe. At Duke, one of 
the stars is Alaskan Trajan Langdon.
And it really should be no surprise 
that the ACC has the recruiting advan
tage. If you had to choose between the 
urban campuses offered by the Big East 
or the tree-lined, uniquely designed cam
puses along Tobacco Road, I think your 
choice would be obvious. Life at these 
ACC schools is so good that Duncan, 
who would have been the number one 
pick in the last two NBA drafts, says he 
returned to school each time because he 
loves campus life so much. Can you imag
ine someone at Pitt or Providence or any 
of the other Big East 
schools saying a similar 
thing?
Another bigdifference is in the style of 
play. Whether war
ranted or not, the 
Big East has a 
reputation ofbeing 
a big, bruising con
ference whereas 
the ACC is some
what more freeflowing. One rea
son for this perception is 
that several years ago, the Big 
East tried an experiment where 
players fouled out after their 
sixth foul, not their fifth as is the 
rule in the rest of the college 
basketball universe.
The result of this temporary 
rule change was that Big East 
conference games turned into 
foul-shooting slugfests as play
ers were able to play more physi
cally. However, when these teams 
/ had to play non-conference oppo/ nents or in the NCAA tournament, 
they had to revert back to the five 
foul rule. Doing so meant reverting 
away from a style of play that they 
had used for a majority of their games 
during the regular season. The end 
result was a disaster for the Big
East and this coincided with the na
tional uprising of Duke and North 
Carolina.
The Atlantic Coast Conference is 
without question the best college bas
ketball conference today. Will it re
main that way? Who knows. New su
per-conferences like the Big 12, the 
revamped Western Athletic Confer
ence (WAC), and Conference USA also 
show great potential. On the other 
hand, the Big East continues to floun
der, trying in vain to relive the glories 
of its past.
Team of the Week:
Kansas: You can hear them chanting 
Rock, Chalk, Jayhawk all the way to 
the Final 4. The number one team in the 
country and the only undefeated team in 
Division I faced its toughest test this 
past week when it played Texas Tech on 
the road. Tech had a 16-point lead in the 
first half, but could not hold on as Kan
sas, led by Jacque Vaughn, pulled out a 
86-77 victory.
Games of the Week:
Kentucky at South Carolina: (Tuesday, 9:30 pm on ESPN) Who is the only 
team undefeated in conference play in 
the SEC? Heres a hint: Theyre playing 
in this game and are not the Wildcats. 
The S.C. Gamecocks might be the big
gest surprise in college hoops this year 
next to the resurgence of Maryland. Too 
bad their fairy tale will start falling 
apart with this game.
Duke at Wake Forest: (Wednes
day, 9 pm on ESPN) The Demon Dea
cons used to be the worst of the four 
teams from North Carolina in the 
ACC. Not anymore. Featuring a front
line of Ricardo Peral (610), fresh
man sensation Loren Woods (71), 
and All-World Tim Duncan (610), 
this Wake team could give some NBA 
teams some trouble.

Columnist picks teams in Lindros 
trade for the Stanley Cup finals
On the Net
By Chris Adukiatis
Its the end of January and the 
All-Star break is over, which 
means the hockey season is in 
full swing. The regular season 
finally starts to mean something 
as teams begin to fight for play
off spots. In just a few short 
months, Lord Stanleys Cup will 
be held aloft and kissed by...? 
That is the big question. Well, 
stick around and you will soon 
have an answer.
The only two teams with a 
legitimate shot at reaching the 
Finals are the current leaders 
in their respective confer
ences; the Philadelphia Flyers 
in the East and the Colo
rado Avalanche in the 
West. What is so intrigu
ing about these two 
teams is the many simi
larities between them 
this season. Each team 
has lost star players to 
injuries this season.
But the true irony is 
that one trade is 
largely responsible 
for the success of 
both teams.
The Flyers began 
the season without 
their big man, Eric Lindros. Af
ter sitting out the first 23 games, 
Lindros returned to the lineup
after nursing a groin injury left 
over from this summers World 
Cup. How does Lindros, pumped 
to be back on the ice, triumphantly 
return to the ice? By knocking 
out a new teammate, defenseman 
Paul Coffey, with a concussion. 
Luckily for Lindros and the Fly
ers, Coffey only sat out about a 
week. Now with the exception of
defenseman Karl _______
Dykhuis (who will miss 
four weeks with a
jury bug, although he only missed 
two games.
Despite injuries to their star 
players both teams, especially 
Colorado, did quite well without 
their stars. The Flyers managed 
to start the season repectably, 
compiling a 12-10-3 record with
out Lindros. Without Forsberg, 
Colorado went 11-2-4 and are

The Avalanche started the sea

been bogged down with injuries. 
The best one-two punch in the 
league, Joe Sakic and Peter 
Forsberg, was out of commission 
for a few weeks. Forsberg suf

returned, but Sakic is 
still out. On top of 
that, goaltender 
Patrick Roy also 
succumbed to 
theincurrently 7-2-2 without Sakic. 
The fact that the Avalanche can 
play so well without their two 
best players is very scary for 
opponents and is a good example 
of the depth this team possesses.
The story behind these two 
teams successes can be summed 
up in one word  Lindros. The

You dont want to play games like this, 
where they are just going to injure our 
players. We have lost 2/3 of the first line, 
bemoaned player/coach Tom Sullivan.
The most detrimental things to hap
pen this weekend were the 
injuries to Adukaitis and 
Buck. Jim Buck, a first line 
winger, is out for then sea

collarbone.
I was going against the

there to make an impact. First, 
they tripped Adukaitis up as 
he was moving into the offen
sive zone, causing him to loose 
control and injure his ham
string on the Duquesne net. 
Minutes after Adukaitis left 
the ice, Buck took a high hit 
on the far boards and immedi
ately skated towards the 
bench. He would leave the 
game with a broken collar
bone. No call was made on 
either play.
Later, in the third period 
came another scare from cap
tain Maddalena. I was checksomeone as he took a shot 
^d his follow-through blasted

my jaw in and partly knocked 
me out. Again, no call was 
ttade on the play.
Duquesne won the game 10-2, 
but the blow was not the CMUs 
ego, rather more to the team and 
their run for the championship. 
They went to town on us basi

now know how it feels to be on the

Sunday morning was another 
chapter as new lines went out 
and thrashed U Pitt Johnstown, 
10-3. CMU abused UPJs shaky 
defensive unit with 35 shots. The 
win included four more goals for 
Ardire, giving him 16 goals in six 
games. Anthony Paul chipped in 
two, while defensemen Tom 
Sullivan and Voulgaris each got 
one. The second line tandem of 
sophomore Steve Leonhardt and 
junior Derek Jander also added 
a goal a piece. The team was 
flat, my line, which is usually 
the third line, forechecked well.
We made a lot of shotssome 
went in and well take a win 
where we can get one, 
commeneted Leonhardt.
Adding to the offensive ex
plosion were defensemen 
Voulgaris (two assists), gradu
ate student Blair Echols (one 
assist), Sullivan (one assist), 
and junior David Mitzel ( 2 
assists). Forwards Paul (three 
assists), Jander (two assists), 
Andy Oxnard (three assists), 
Fitzgerald (two assists), and 
Leonhardt (one assist) also 
contributed to the scoring 
drives. Starting goalie Min 
had 13 saves. Gil played 
great, added Voulgaris, He 
was all over the place.
CMU ended the weekend 9-

Men come up short
By MATTHEW SOLITRO
Tartan Staffwriter
Its hard to compete when you dont 
make your freethrows, said mens bas
ketball coach Tony Wingen after their 
tough loss Friday evening. Poor 
freethrow shooting in the first half may 
have cost the Tartans a second victory in 
UAA play this season. In spite of a 
Herculean effort on the part of the Tar
tans, they came up short, bowing to 
Washington University 81-85.
The loss dropped the Tartans record 
to 6-11 overall and 1-6 in the UAA. Its 
been a frustrating year from the stand
point that our record isnt very good, 
said Wingen. These guys bust their 
tails. They play hard every day in prac
tice. They deserve to win more, and that 
makes it all the more frustrating.

Andy Sofish watches a teammate getting 
blocked by a Wash U. player Friday night.
Friday evening in the Skibo Gymna
sium, the play started out fairly even 
until the Bears of Washington Univer
sity went on a 10-2 run, aided by the 
Tartans inaccuracy from the line, to open 
up their largest lead of the first half.
However, CMU continued to fight 
hard for every basket and slowly nar
rowed the gap throughout the first half 
as their defense tightened up. Sopho
more backup center Dan Bowersox was 
especially tough under the basket, 
blocking one shot and intimidating 
many others. Unfortunately, Bowersox 
would have to leave the game when he . 
dislocated his left shoulder going for a 
loose ball.
The team isnt sure how long he will 
be out of action, but Bowersox feels he 
may be back soon. Hopefully, Ill be 
able to return to practice next week if 
everything goes well, said Bowersox. 
Its the first time Ive dislocated it, so it 
shouldnt take too long to heal.
The Tartans continued to shoot poorly 
from the freepoint line, but were still 
able to tie it up at 33 apiece with 3:12 
remaining in the half. Several Washing
ton turnovers and a three-pointer by 
senior guard Kevin Cackovic with 30 
seconds left allowed CMU to carry a 42- 
39 lead into the locker room at halftime.
The second half began with an explo
sion of offense for both sides. As the 
pace of the game settled down a little, 
CMU still held on to a two-point lead 
with 14:40 left in the game. However, 
when senior center Gary Trendel 
picked up his third foul, Wingen was 
left with no other option but to play 
without a big man down low. Gary 
picked up his third foul, and we had to 
get him out of there for a little while, 
said Wingen.
It was still a one or two point game 
with Gary being out of there, but not 
having the other big guy to go to really 
hurt us.Please see SHORT, page 9

Overwhelming. From Sunday to Sunday, 
the Tartan ice hockey club underwent tre
mendous upheaval. Its overwhelming to play 
without the first line, said junior defenseman 
Paul Voulgaris after Sunday, February 2nds 
game against UPJ. No first line?
The previous Sunday, the team roster was 
full for an exhibition game against the Pitts
burgh Stars. Senior forward Ray Ardire scored 
four goals and graduate student Roger 
Maddalena chipped in one to tie the Stars 5-5. 
Rookie goalie Gil Min had 16 saves and an 
assist to preserve the tie. Junior Scott Fitzgerald 
had two assists and senior Anthony Paul 
matched him while Voulgaris and senior Jim 
Buck chipped in an assist a piece. The Tartans 
ended January undefeated in four games.
Its a good thing that February is a short 
month because CMU was dealt some severe 
blows to start it. On Saturday, in exhibition 
play, the Tartans faced the Duquesne Dukes, 
Division III members of the Eastern Collegiate 
Hockey Association. For the first half of the 
opening period, CMU looked in the game. The 
first line of Buck, Maddalena, and senior Chris 
Adukaitis controlled play. Adukaitis scored 
first, assisted by Maddalena. Buck followed 
suit, assisted by Maddalena and Voulgaris. It 
was 2-0 Tartans and everything looked totally 
under control. Until it wasnt anymore.
Relja Ivanovic, coming off a two-week re
spite due to concussion, was ejected for the 
game for fighting in the second. The Dukes 
had roared back to score four against the 
Tartans and proceeded in the second to score 
three more. Interim coach Matt Williams, 
pulled starting goalie Jon Kliegman; he had 
19 saves in the one and a half periods.
The intense situations continued. Duquesne 
obviously was not just there to win, they were

The mens and womens swim
ming teams closed out the regu
lar season this weekend with a 
pair of dual meets. On Friday 
night, the Tartans hosted the 
Westminster Titans, and then hit 
the road on Saturday to take on 
the swimmers of Fairmont State.
Although the men lost 89-110 to 
Fairmont, and the women lost 88- 
116, head coachDavidBelowich was 
satisfied with the teams perfor
mance. There were some things 
that we were trying to accomplish, 
said Belowich. And that was re
flected abit in the scoring. Although 
the team was competing hard, the
CMU swimmers also had bigger 
things on their minds  the UAA 
Championships which will be held 
in three weeks. Because they were 
preparing for the championship 
meet, CMU tackled a few events 
differently to get some additional 
experience. At the UAA competi
tion, there is no 1,000-yard freestyle 
event  only a 1,650-yard event.
To get a trial time for this event, 
and to get a feel for the extra dis
tance, the CMU competitors in the 
1,000-yard freestyle just kept on 
swimming after the Fairmont State 
swimmers stopped at the 1,000- 
yard mark. Also, several swim
mers tried new events for the first 
time, including senior Ilania 
Kaplan and sophomore Michelle
Kondo, who swam strongly in the 
100-yard backstroke.
TheTartanshostedWestminster 
College last Friday night at 6 pm in

Habitat for Humanity helps out
By SUSAN WATSON
Tartan Senior Staffwriter
While dreary Pittsburgh weather 
kept must students indoors this past 
Saturday, approximately 15 CMU 
students volunteered their time with 
Habitat for Humanity to refurbish 
dilapidated homes in East Liberty. 
Throughout this semester, Habitat 
for Humanity will go to underdevel
oped areas of Pitts
burgh where volun
teers can rebuild 
homes for those in 
need. The group 
plans to rebuild 
various local neighborhoods seven 
more times in the 
upcoming months.
In Pittsburgh, 
most of Habitats 
construction work is to rehabilitate 
old homes. That means it takes homes 
that are dangerous structures and 
eyesores in a neighborhood and cre
ates a simple, decent place for some
one to live. This makes the neighbor
hood a little more pleasant to live in, 
as well as increasing the property 
value, said Audrey Grube, a senior 
electrical and computer engineering 
student and a Habitat for Humanity 
volunteer.
By resurrecting homes in which
people can actually live, Habitat for 
Humanity reestablishes not only a 
strong sense of community for Pitts
burgh residents, but justice as well.
Habitat is an organization dedi
cated to restoring justice to the com
munities in which it works. By jus
tice, I mean economic justice. We 
want to eliminate the problem of 
homelessness by building affordable 
housing, said Dave Bauer, a fifthBy helping with Habitat for Humanity,

glad I did it.
 Susan Wyche, 
Habitat for Humanity participant

computer engineering and mathemat
ics.
Habitat for Humanitys primary 
concern is to help those in need, 
but it contrasts with other commu
nity service organizations in that 
it utilizes the productivity of the 
actual individuals it helps.
Through volunteer labor and do
nations of money and materials, 
Habitat builds and rehabilitates 
houses with the help of the future
homeowner, Grube said. Houses are 
sold to partner families for no profit 
with no-interest mortgages. Mort
gage payments are recycled to con
struct more habitat houses.
Involvement with Habitat for Hu
manity allows homeowners not only 
to receive a new home but also an 
education. Habitat not only teaches 
volunteers construction skills, but it 
teaches homeowners these skills as

that when some

know how to do 
something as simple as [finding] a

are skills that make the homeowners

To become a part of a Pittsburgh and 
create a culture of their own.
This is what five CMU undergradu
ates set out to do by opening their door to 
their South Oakland community. Search
ing for a new place for cultural and artis
tic expression, they created an indepen
dent art space in their house, non-funded 
by outside sources, with no political 
agenda. We wanted to create a dialogue 
between the students and the commu
nity, said Melissa Haworth, a senior art 
major and one of the founder/residents of 
Instant Art Space. We come from out
side [the] community and wanted to add 
to the environment.
Haworth along with senior art ma
jors, Kevin Kalb, Amera Rizk, and se
nior English major Cameron Dezen, held 
their first opening, Body Parts, in De
cember; the show consisted of perfor
mance, visual and other types of art
work by various CMU students. Theres 
usually only about a handful of art stu
dents who come to gallery openings, 
said Kalb. We wanted to have a show 
where lots of old Italian folks would 
show up, too.
For Haworth, the art space was a way of 
defining herself culturally. I dont have 
any major culture behind me and this was 
a place to start, she said.
Instant Art Space consists of two 
rooms that are approximately 300 square feet. Haworth said 
that not more than $100 was spent on supplies for the renova
tions which the residents did themselves. Dezen, Kalb, Rizk, 
and Haworth live on the top two floors, and transformed the 
first floor into the exhibition space.
Burnt-out warehouses are Pittsburgh. Hills and old churches 
and cheap real estate are Pittsburgh, reads their mission 
statement. Because we found ourselves happy, in a huge old 
house... Instant Art Space grew out of 3714 Parkview Avenue. 
Dezen, who sang in the last show, said that the space was a safe 
haven for her in terms of expression  there was no formal 
weight that comes with the university setting.
Im a writer and singer, and for me the interaction 
between all types of art and being able to see the influences 
of other artists are important, she said. The shows speak 
for themselves  theres no doctrine that we go by other 
than that.
According to junior art major Matt Keegan, who curated 
the last show, the shows are supposed to be more than a 
schmooze session.
I wanted to have events  more then just white walls....

People would be performing in one 
room while others would be setting up 
in another, he said.
Keegan said that the show was not 
necessarily figurative, but focused on 
individual body parts; Dezen sang a 
song called Cesarean and another art
ist hung a series of paintings that rep
resented legs. There was a noticeable 
theme of body parts that I picked up 
on, said Keegan. It was happening 
naturally in the artwork of the people 
around me.
Kalb said that the show was a 
broadbased analysis of different types 
of artwork. Group shows like that just 
dont happen, added Haworth.
Both Kalb and Haworth found that 
there were instant benefits to not being 
associated with the University or the 
art department in that they had more 
freedom to transform the space to their 
specifications. In the UC [gallery] you 
cant even hang things up with nails, 
said Kalb. There are also limitations 
to showing your work at The Frame
[formerly known as Forbes 
Gallery], he added.
Instant Art Space happens 
by itself, said Kalb. We are 
able to use the house context 
and the home environment 
to shape the shows.
The next show, 
Hipponomes, will feature 
the work of senior art major 
Anthony Deluca. He found 
the space to be an ideal loca
tion for his show because of 
his interest in preserving rep
resentations of historical and 
cultural myths. My work is 
a personal dialogue, said 
Deluca. I use a lot of literary 
references ... and Im hoping 
to offer that to the viewer.
Delucas show will open this 
Friday at 8 pm. After this 
date, viewing is by appoint
ment only. For more informa

Ive done a lot of different 
things in my life, said Mark 
Cox, a one-time bridge painter, 
university professor, and prizewinning poet. But Im also very 
comfortable in a lot of different 
worlds, and each one of those 
worlds reflects a different part 
of my personality.
Last Friday night, CMUs Vis
iting Writers Series welcomed 
Cox as the first writer of its spring 
line-up.
Author of two compilations of 
poetry entitled Smoulder (1989) 
and Barbells of the Gods (1988), 
as well as winner of the Push
cart Prize and the Whiting Writ
ers Award, Cox said that his 
varied past has provided him 
with a great amount of material 
for his work.
I tend to write whats prob
ably a pretty mainstream lyric 
narrative poem.... Ive written a
new manuscripts, displayed 
Coxs versatility in his ability to 
transform everyday occurrences 
and images into meaningful and 
touching insights into his life 
while using a variety of differ
ent styles.
He gave life to a knife and 
cutting board, made a piece of 
furniture into a message about 
divorce, and told the story of a 
newly widowed grandfather 
through his deceased wifes love 
of black olives.
I tend to not be typically con
sistent in my approach to lan
guage, and stylistically, I range 
pretty widely, said Cox of his 
technique.
Ranging from light and hu
morous to nostalgic and seri
ous, Coxs readings had the au
dience chuckling one minute and 
frozen and speechless the next. 
Other works that he read in
cluded The Pier, Inhospi

lot of anecdotal and story poetry 
based on personal experience, 
said Cox.
This narrative style came out 
strongly in the poetry that he 
chose to read for his visit to 
CMU. Poems such as Things 
My Grandfather Must Have 
Said, The Tunnel at the End 
of the Light, and The 
Garglers, which came mainly 
from Smoulder as well as from

This His Suit. His reading of 
The Garglers came complete 
with audio-visual effects, as the 
last line was said while he 
gargled water. Like much of his 
poetry, this poem, about a couple 
who profess their love to one 
another through their morning 
ritual of gargling, is said to be a 
true story.
His imagery 
really moved me.
It was so realis
tic, said Eliza
beth Curriv, a 
freshman writ
ing major, of a 
poem that Cox 
called his mar
riage poem, 
about his wife.
Now an associ
ate professor and 
director of the 
graduate pro

writing at Okla

versity, Cox 
takes much of 
his inspiration 
from his wife and 
son. My son is a 
kind of wellspring of mate
rial for me, saidCox.
Cox has also taught at Ver mont College and Goddard 
College and has appeared 
in numerous literary maga
zines. Several anthologies 
also include his work, suph 
as Outsiders, New Ameri

by Amit N. Kar
Ive only ever totally and utterly hated 
one girl in my whole entire life. Actually, 
I dont think hate is a strong enough 
Word; I abhorred her, I detested her, the 
very mention of her name made my skin 
crawl and blood would pour out of my 
gums.
Okay, so while that may be something 
of an exaggeration, my hatred for her 
did cause my friends and I to drive over 
her flower bushes in our cars  no 
amount of air-freshening will ever dis
pense so sweet an aroma.
See, she had it coming. This woman, 
(whom we shall call Cruella DeVille), 
was guilty of one the most unforgivable 
sins a person can commit  selfishness.
because she really wasnt all that smart. 
Cruella was the only person in a gradu
ating class of 25 who never helped to 
raise money for our graduation trip. On 
the bus, when I was handing out the 
spending money, I had visions of setting 
the notes on fire and shoving them down 
her throat. Cruella DeVille shamelessly 
felt she was too important to pull her 
own weight, and she made very few 
friends as a result.
An ever-increasing emphasis on team 
work in professional environments 
means the Mr. and Mrs. DeVilles of the 
world will get whats coming to them. 
The ability to successfully function in 
todays team environment depends 
as much on actively pulling ones 
own weight as it does on fresh 
breath, hygiene, and good table / iQQQ 
maners. As with many skills. -
this is something that 
should be cultivated in col
lege. But over the last threeThe group project is a good example 
(not perfect because grades are in
volved). On this campus, complaints 
about a group member who is shirking 
his or her duties are the rule, not the 
exception. This boggles my mind. Why 
would a person actively seek to 
lose his or her peers respect?
Got something better to do?
A problem set maybe?
Think youre too impor
tant? Some lessons you

who determine your success, and in life, 
obstacles rarely present themselves as 
problem sets. (Hear that, 100-level pro
fessor?) Almost every important mile
stone is reached with the active in
volvement of others.
But here at CMU, theres a more tell
ing testament to the level of social-loaf
ing that goes onstudent leadership. A 
small proportion of the student body 
gets actively involved in student organi
zations, and the rest of 
us do little outside of

At CMU, you can get away with so
cial loafing because professors are ei
ther too blind to pick the sycophants 
out, or too busy to deal with them 
appropriately. But you can be sure it 
will lead to no end of harm once you 
leave this protected, artificial environ
ment. In life, social loafing will ham

in terms of actually building homes. However, 
as his involvement with the organization increased, 
he began to see that his contribution was much  
more than a professional learning experience.
When I first started with Habitat for Human
ity, I thought it would be a great chance to get 
experience at building things. But after I was 
going a few times, I realized there was more 
meaning behind this organization. You give your 
time to people. You give help to people who need 
help, he said.
Newhouse also enjoys being a part of this type of 
community service because it enables him to use 
his major to help others. Habitat makes it clear 
how I can use my major and make the community 
a better place, but at the same time, students in 
any major can become involved and improve the 
community, he said.
Part of Habitat for Humanitys uniqueness stems 
from the fact that volunteers can actually see the 
tangible result of their efforts.
It is not unusual for those involved with Habito meet the homeowner while... at the Habitat 
site. This allows people to know the person they 
helping, which makes the experience all the 
more significant, said Grube.
You leave that day and you see the door you 
built that day. Its a permanent thing. The house 
stays there. You see what you built and how it 
affects the people who live there, Newhouse
In addition to the service Habitat for Human
ity provides to the Pittsburgh area, the organi
zation also takes part in spring break projects 
in which they build houses in other parts of the 
United States.
I was part of an alternative spring break two 
years ago in Boca Raton, Florida where we were 
the fourth week of a TDlitz build. We finished the 
house and got to see the homeowner when she was 
presented with her house. It was tremendous, 
Newhouse said.
Our most exciting project will be starting in the 
fall, Grube said. We will be sponsoring our own
Shady side Presbyterian Church. The group is fi
nalizing efforts to publicize its plans throughout 
the CMU community and hopes to begin a 
fundraising campaign to get the house underway.
Habitat for Humanity appeals to many because 
it has a direct impact on those who volunteer.

in her first Habitat for Humantiy project this past

By helping with Habitat for Humanity, a void in 
my life was filled. I felt like contributing to the 
community would be a great way for me to focus my 
energies on something meaningful. Im really glad 
I did it, she said.
Initially, I was attracted to the opportunity 
to get off campus, get some exercise, and work 
in construction. As I learned about Habitats 
philosophy of working with homeowners in
stead of for them, I realized it was something I 
wanted to devote a huge part of my life to, 
Grube said.
Habitat doesnt just help provide people with 
a home, it helps provide them with dignity. 
They take pride in their home because they are 
not renting it or having it given to them. Habi
tat homeowners have not only worked on their 
home, but are also required to put in roughly 
175 hours of volunteer work on other Habitat 
homes, she added.
Bauer said students may want to become in
volved with Habitats cause simply because it is a 
useful deviation from the stressful workload that 
is so characteristic of a CMU students life. He 
added that the exposure students get through 
their service regarding the way in which others 
live is equally important.
Habitat is a stress reliever. Theres also a 
desire. I believe theres a real desire to help 
others which people just cant ignore. I think it 
makes people aware of how many others live. 
You may hear of the homeless, but actually 
seeing and doing something about it really sticks 
with you, he said.
At the end of the day, you have something to 
show for your work. I think there is a lot of truth in 
habitats philosophy that everyone deserves a 
simple decent place to live, said Grube.
If you are interested in getting involved with 
Habitat for Humanitys next project which will 
take place on Saturday, February 8th, email Lisa 
Ferrugia at ferrugia@andrew.cmu.edu.

Volume 91, Issue 15DIVERSIONS
The Tartan, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania3 February 1997
A few days ago, in a theater not so far away... 
It is a period of long lines. Anxious fans, coining irom a\\ o\iev, 
have waited 20 years to see the epic on the big screen agavn...Special edition shines on the big screen
By GREG MARCKS
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Star Wars and I grew up 
together. Thanks to sparse 
HBO programming, I watched 
it every morning for a month. By 
age eight, after Empire and Jedi, 
I owned the Hoth playset, the Ewok 
village, and most of the action fig
ures, including two Emperors. When
I was sixteen, I watched the trilogy 
(from the front row) on the biggest 
screen in Boston. Now, both twenty, 
Star Wars and I are reunited, and I have 
the great honor of reviewing the great
est film ever made.
Film: Star Wars
Special Edition 
Director: George Lucas 
Company: Twentieth 
Century Fox
There are millions like me, children 
who grew up exposed to a universe in
side our televisions that was far more 
interesting than our backyards. Until 
now, many had never seen Star Wars on 
the big screen, had never seen the
sandperson standing next to the Bantha, 
had never heard R-2 beep loudly enough 
to rupture eardrums. Now you can.
Of course, what you will see is not Star 
Wars, but Star Wars Special Edition. 
Ever since I first heard about these rereleases, I was overjoyed. The film would 
be restored to its original majestic col
ors, and the sound would be digitally 
remastered for an even more impressive 
aural assault. Parents would take their 
kids to see Return of the Jedi as mine 
had taken me. But, somewhere deep 
inside me, I felt a nagging doubt.They 
were going to change Star Wars.
How could they change the only work 
of art I have ever truly appreciated? As 
excited as I was to see what amazing 
effects George Lucas could come up with 
today, I wasnt sure they belonged in a 
film he made twenty years ago.
When it was released, Star Wars was 
hailed as a film before its time. Now that 
time has passed, why downplay its 
achievement? Rationally I understood 
that Lucas now wanted to make possible 
what time, budget, and technology had 
not allowed him in 1977, but emotion
ally I was worried that even George 
Lucas might be meddling with a force
outside his control. Postpone the surgery. Skip your wedAll these issues were still running ding. It is so incredible ... I cant even 
through my mind as I waited tensely in describe it... the most amazing... sound 
the theater. Then it started, and I never so real... vibrant color... space footage...
p.
* i
Imperial storm troopers ride new digital creatures.
 1997 Twentieth Century Fox
even had time to wonder how I could 
have possibly doubted the man.
Go see it right now. Blow off class.
chill down my spine. My worries were all 
unfounded. This is still the greatest film 
ever made. Only now its better. Trust
me. Just go see it right now.
Here are your reasons. 1 
This restoration print is a 1 
masterpiece of color. The digi- 3 
tal sound is amazing. The old} 
footage that was reinserted adds 1 
dimension to the character rela-1 
tionships. Most importantly, the! 
computer generated imagery of 
which I was so skeptical popped my^ 
eyes out of my skull and right into my" 
frosty beverage.
The only time the computer-animation got carried away was during the 
entrance to Mos Eisley, when the large,: 
dinosaur-like creatures in the back-: 
ground stole the scene. The Jabba scene 
is also questionable. He is animated: 
pretty well as far as Huts go, but the. 
scene merely repeats the dialogue previ
ously exchanged between Han and. 
Greedo.
Thats as critical as Im going to get 
about Star Wars Special Edition. For 
the last time, go. Its your civic duty, and 
it will make you a child again, even if you 
already are one. And if for some freakish 
reason youve not seen Star Wars, youve 
never not seen it like this before.
Go now. Dont wait any longer.Trilogy CD sets delve into musical wiamm
By DAN GOLDWASSER
Tartan Staffwriter
In 1977, George Lucas gave the 
world Star Wars and shortly 
thereafter the soundtrack to the 
film was released on LP and cas
sette. The success of the 
soundtrack was surprising  it 
raced to the top of the charts, 
garnered the distinction as the 
best selling and most collected 
soundtrack in history, won com
poser John Williams his third 
Academy Award, and three more 
Grammy awards. The Main 
Theme is one of the most memo
rable movie tunes in cinema his
tory, and will continue to be so for 
some time.
[ What: Star Wars Special 
Edition Original Motion 
Picture Soundtrack 
Company: RCA Victor
Now, in 1997, to celebrate the 
20th anniversary of. Star Wars, 
RCA Victor is releasing special 
edition soundtracks to all three 
Star Wars films. On January 14, 
Star, Wars: A New Hope was re
leased. The music from the film 
was presented in its entirety and 
in chronological order as it ap
pears in the film. Spanning 2 
CDs, the set includes 20 pages of 
liner notes discussing the music 
and its role in the film. The CDs 
themselves are laser engraved
With a couple of tracks that 
were never before available, and 
a recently discovered outtake of 
Binary Sunset which is a unique 
piece of music and worth hear
ing, this soundtrack is one which 
everyone should own. But wait 
theres more! Hidden on the first 
disc are the five original takes of 
the Main Theme unedited, com
pleted with recording studio ban
ter. The differences are few, but 
enough to be noticed. As 
soundtracks go, Star Wars is prob
ably the most popular. The music 
fits the film, and while Williams 
admittedly pays tribute to Holst 
and Wagner, it does not mini
mize its impact at all. The CDs 
were remixed from the original 
recording session tapes, and 
sound better than everinstru
ments I did not realize were uti
lized are clearly recognizable.
On January 28, The Empire 
Strikes Back original soundtrack 
was released. Containing over 20 
minutes of previously unavail
able music, this soundtrack will 
be sure to delight fans as well. 
However, music that is not in the 
movie made it onto these CDs 
which is both a good thing and a 
bad thing. It is good because it is 
music we not only were unable to 
get, but it is also music we never 
heaid! Unfortunately, one of the 
main concepts of releasing these 
soundtracks is to provide the lis
tener with the ability to listen to
placing cues which never existed 
in the film can disrupt that order. 
But the music is wonderful to 
listen to, and the clarity is excep
tional, considering it is an analog 
recording. Packaged in the same 
way as the Star Wars soundtrack, 
the CDs are engraved with the 
Imperial symbol, emphasizing 
the main theme for the movie, 
and contain 20 pages of liner 
notes.
In three weeks, on February 
25, Return of the Jedi will be 
released on CD. It is safe to as
sume that the packaging will be 
the same. What will make this 
release one of the more antici
pated releases is that it will con
tain new music composed and 
conducted by John Williams this 
year. In the original film, there is 
a song played at Jabbas Palace, 
Lapti Nek. This song will be 
removed, and replaced with a 
jazzier, longer song. This is what 
George Lucas wanted initially, 
and now he is able to do it. Also, 
the ending is now a bit different 
from the original film. Instead of 
just an Ewok Celebration, there 
will be celebrations on other 
worlds in the galaxy  including 
Bespin (Cloud City), Tatooine, 
and Coruscant (the Imperial 
Homeworld). For this, Williams 
composed new music which will 
be available on the CD. In addi
tion to this new music, previ
ously unavailable music will be
The streets of Mos Eislev..

My favorite part of a new comic is the 
short message from the creator that of
ten appears in the back of the first issue. 
c jf a comic were like a meal, then this 
} message would be the dessert. Few cre{ ators are as forthright in their afterwords 
| as Jae Lee is in Hellshock #1.
Most of you probably remember 
vJlellshock as a four-issue limited series 
Efrom Image Comics about two years back. 
Lee says in his afterword that the lim
ited series was, a creature that was 
H)om prematurely. 
I s As someone who had mixed emotions 
iSabout that series, I cannot express how 
i* much I respect Lee for having the guts to 
^admit that it wasnt his best effort. Forw; ,;an initial writing effort, Hellshock was
2 respectable and I liked it enough to pick 
up the first issue of the new unlimited 
.series.
After a two-year hiatus filled with
research and plot development on Lees the next monthly installment, 
part, Hellshock is back and, pardon the
cliche, better than ever. Lees artistic Jason Andracki is a senior profesability has improved greatly, further sional writing major. Hes not in the

mains as dark as ever, but now has a 
realistic edge that I havent seen 
in his work before. Lee is joined by 
painter Jose Villarrubia, who adds 
to the moodiness of this tale.
If youre expecting superheroics 
and spandex like most of the Im
age line, then look elsewhere. If 
youre looking for emotion and 
depth that typically is found in 
Vertigo and independent books, 
then Hellshock is the book for you.
In this issue, we get reacquainted 
with Daniel) but the real star is 
Christina, Daniels psychiatrist.
As someone who is extremely un
sure about his future career path,
I can certainly identify with her.
Lee has managed to create char
acters that have personality 
rather than cool costumes.
Lees two-year break was worth 
it. This incarnation ofHellshock, a 
prequel to the limited series, is 
well orchestrated and beautifully 
presented. Lee has honed his writ
ing skills and improved his intriguing artwork. Hellshock is a el997 |mage Comics

Dont let the subtitles scare you
 this movie rocks.
Its about Italian Jews who fall 
into hard times at the start of 
World War II, as most Jews did at 
the time. See, in Italy, things 
werent as bad as they were in 
Germany  not right away, at 
least. So if you were Jewish, you 
could still walk the streets and 
stuff.
I What: The Garden of the 
Finzi-Continis 
I Director: Vittorio De Sica 
Company: CCC Filmkunst
But there were a lot of things 
you couldnt do: you couldnt 
marry a non-Jew, you couldnt 
have servants, you couldnt own 
a business. It was a real bitch, 
but at least they werent throw
ing you into prison camps and 
branding serial numbers into 
your arms.
Naturally, all that happened 
soon enough, but in the mean
time, all those young Italian kids 
could run around, play tennis, 
walk in the park, and have pas
sionate sex without fear of being 
arrested.
In an environment like that,
you know somethings going to go 
wacky.
Theres this guy, Giorgio, and 
hes hot for his childhood sweet
heart, Micol, who returns his 
affections at first. But when the 
Fascist government starts com
ing down hard on the Jews, 
Micol dumps Giorgio because 
his family is a bunch of middleclass schmoes, whereas hers is 
these rich mucky-mucks. Its 
dangerous for her to be seen 
with him.
This is pretty emotional be
cause we know that she wants to 
love him but she has no choice 
but to break his heart. I cried. 
(But I cry pretty easily  I cry at 
the end of Terminator 2. Every 
time.)
It became even more moving
later in the film ________________
when the gov
ernment de
cides to round 
up the usual 
Jews and toss 
them in concen
tration camps.
Here, we see ^ 
that Micols ac
tions didnt finally make a differ
ence, because theyre all going to 
die anyway.
Its a lot like Schindlers List, 
except nobody gets rescued  
they all die. Well, we dont see
them die, but we know they will. 
All except Giorgio and a couple of 
his relatives, who, we are told, 
magically escape to France. But 
thats probably not good, since 
France got its butt kicked in 
World War II.
This movie won the Academy 
Award for Best Foreign Film in 
1970, so you know its gotta be 
good.
It was also directed by Vittorio 
De Sica, who made The Bicycle 
Thief, which -Im telling you is 
good. In fact, its better than The 
Garden of the Finzi-Continis, but 
The Bicycle Thief isnt playing at 
the Harris Theatre, so youll have 
to rent that.
But in the meantime, go see 
Garden because its got a little 
bit of everything: romance, com"... its got a little bit of every
thing: romance, comedy, 
sports, sex, violence, chases, 
drama, anti-Semitism. 
edy, sports, sex, violence, 
chases, drama, anti-Semitism 
Marlon Brando will love it. But 
the anti-Semitism is portrayed 
as a bad thing, so maybe hell 
hate it.

Chances are, youve never heard of 
the band Karma to Burn. Chances 
are, you probably wont hear of them 
again. Though worth listening to, 
their new album, Karma to Bum 
does not particularly stand out in the 
sea of angry and loud bands that simi
larly declare that ...the world will 
soon find out about ... the madness 
and mayhem of Karma to Burn. Un
fortunately for the band, this rather 
optimistic appraisal of their situation 
is unlikely to ever approach realiza
tion.
Who: Karma to Burn 
What: Karma to Burn 
Company: Roadrunner 
Records
Karma to Burn is a four-person band, 
made up of J. J arosz doing vocals, Dickie 
playing bass, William on guitar, and 
Nicholas handling the drums. All the 
songs except one 
were written by 
Karma to Burn.
The band has sev
eral points in its fa
vor. First of all, the 
strong guitar riffs 
and drum beats are 
quite good through
out almost every 
song, and are the 
best reason to listen 
to the album. They 
are well played, if 
not exceptionally 
catchy, and one can 
sense that the band 
members are fairly 
talented. Secondly, 
the songs are pretty 
decent, with one or 
two songs that are 
quite good. Finally, 
the band is rather 
creative in its use of 
limited resources, 
creating little hooks 
or riffs that serve to 
distinguish one song 
from another.
These good points, 
while constant

several songs.
Almost as important are the vocals. 
To put it simply: They are bad. The 
vocals are delivered in a monotonous 
drone in many of the tracks, and some
times may be described as a mixture 
between a growl and a grunt.
Karma to Burn began its life as a 
purely instrumental band, having only 
numbers to distinguish their songs 
from one another. This shows quite 
clearly while listening to the album. 
The vocals detract from the songs, 
and the thrde best tracks are those 
that are only instrumental. At several 
points in songs with lyrics, I found 
myself wishing that they had been 
recorded without any vocals.
While Karma to Burn makes a sin

their songs by altering the pacing and 
guitar riffs, too many of the songs 
simply sound the same. There are no 
really catchy hooks either, so although 
the songs are generally well crafted, 
they are rather forgettable.

r TheT.S. Monk Band, led by the son of 
jazz legend Thelonius Monk, performed 
cio a packed house last Saturday in 
Rangos Hall. Monk, a dervish of a drum
mer, thumped and romped through a set 
*of six jazz staples like Round Mid
night and Marvelous Marvin.
Featuring the work of bassist Gary 
i'Wang, piano player Ronnie Mathews, 
H-and trumpeter Don Sickler, among oth
ers, the band seemed like 
t something out of another age.
-Their music, compared to 
todays mash of pop and rock, 
is a form of self-expression

.jean match. Consider the fact 
vthat, while some would call it

Wang, who originally went 
to Columbia University for a

aithere was Monk: his drum solos had 
roots in his previous work as an R&B
artist. Novel and exciting, his work ex
pands the image of the jazz drummer.
Jazz, like folk music and AC/DC cover 
bands, can be considered to be in stasis. 
The Jazz Age has come and gone, and, as 
Bobby Porcelli, alto sax player for the 
T.S. Monk Band said, The young guys 
are reviving the masters. But the idiom 
is still full of life.

stage, waiting for their solos or the op

embellishment. Monk, charismatic with 
his smile and stories about his dad, 
Thelonius, made the concert into an ex
amination of jazz values.
Jazz may be in a stasis, but its artists 
certainly arent. They still earn their 
money and enjoy their trade. While 
most of those in attendance had only 
heard the work of the greats like Coltrane 
and Goodman, Porcelli made it clear 
that there is still a vibrant musical scene.
Contemporary artists that Porcelli 
endorses include Mulgrew Miller, Roy 
Hargrove, Kenny Garrett, Ralph Moor, 
and Billy Pierce.
The members of Monks band repre
sent the vanguard of the jazz tradition: 
all have their own bands, all 
catalog the old songs, and all 
make way for the new artists 
coming down the pike. The only 
thing jazz players really need 
to do, Monk explained, is to get 
someone to let them play. While 
this is difficult, it is not impos
sible, and the novice will soon 
be indoctrinated into the guild 
of artists.
The concert was produced by 
Tim Warneck, sophomore, elec
trical and computer enginering 
and industrial management 
major,and others at AB Con
certs and is the first in the Black 
History Month Series. Next 
Wednesday at 7pm in 
McConomy Auditorium, AB 
Films will present Struggles in Steel by 
Pittsburgh filmmaker Tony Buba. Buba 
is nationally known for his documenta
ries on Pennsylvania steelworkers.

Gallery shows student art
By BECCA FRIBUSH
Tartan Staffwriter i
Way on the far edge of campus, tucked into the 
Woodlawn apartment building and facing Forbes 
Avenue, lies Carnegie Mellons student-run art 
gallery. Some of you may remember it as the 
Forbes Gallery, but it has started the semester 
with a new name, The-Frame, and a new roster of 
exhibits.
The gallerys directors are Shaunach Talley, a 
junior in the BHA program with majors in sculp
ture and European studies and a minor in indus
trial management, and Gretchen Dematera, a jun
ior social and decision sciences major with a minor 
in art. The Frame not only is run completely by 
students, but aims to exhibit the work of CMU fine 
arts, architecture, and design students as well. 
Featured shows change weekly; the work is on 
display Wednesdays through Sundays, with Mon
days and Tuesdays reserved for taking down and 
putting up the exhibits.
Last week, The Frame opened for the semester 
by showcasing the work of two junior art majors, 
Seldon S. Yuan and Justin Greene. The featured 
works of each of these artists were admirable 
enough on their own, yet their themes and subjects 
complemented each other so well that the com
bined show was made even better. Both Yuan and 
Greene place humans at the center of their work 
and deal with themes of urban life and mortality.
Especially strong were Yuans black-and-white 
documentary photographs of city life. Buses and 
subways are a recurring theme in his work, and it 
is a testament to his ability that he gives boring old 
Metro terminals and shots of passengers on buses 
a sense of beauty and excitement. Even some of the 
images that dont explicitly deal with subways 
seem to be taken from the window of a fast-moving 
vehicle  an interesting device. This wavering 
effect, combined with Yuans inventive camera 
angles and skillful use of the parallel lines found in 
his streets, buildings, and bus walkways, create a 
memorable set of photographs.
Yuans portfolio also included a number of clay
heads, all misshapen to various degrees. Eyes were 
smushed in, parts of skulls were missing, and 
mouths were wide open and hollowed out. The 
effect was definitely eerie.
Rounding out Yuans work were a series of ve!ry 
sketchily-painted flesh-colored rectangles. Sen 
together, they were suggestive of arms and torss. 
They were intriguing, but it was hard to know what 
to make of them. Similar in style were several 
abstract canvases with swirls of black and white 
paint.
In contrast to the variety of media evident in 
Yuans work, Greene was represented by only 
three large canvases. These works, called homi
cides 1-3, depicted victims of urban violence with
out sensationalizing the subject matter. In each

picture, a man is slumped in a pool of blood. The 
muted colors and watercolorish technique create a 
dreamlike atmosphere, which juxtaposes with the 
starkness of the image for a doubly disturbing 
effect.
I wish there had been more of Greenes work 
here. While its obvious from the three homicides 
that hes a talented artist, the small number of his 
works included in the show didnt allow the viewer 
to get a sense of the broader range of his artistic 
skills and interests.

Every woman, or at least the ones that 
I know, loves a guy in uniform. Every 
. woman I know loVes Chris ODonnell as 
well. Put the two together and I had no 
trouble finding someone to see the movie 
In Love and War with me.
I What: In Love and War 
i Director: Richard Attenborough 
I Company: New Line Cinema
Advertised with the catch phrase, In 
war they found each other, and in each 
other they found love, I had a vague 
idea of whatto expectthis is definitely 
not the first love story to be set in a time 
of war. However, I also hoped that the 
movie would move beyond that and give 
some insight into the curious life of 
Ernest Hemingway.
Unfortunately, that was a little much 
to ask of a movie with Chris ODonnell 
and Sandra Bullock.
Ernest Hemingway, 
played by Chris ODonnell, 
goes to Italy during WWII 
to serve. Although anx
ious to fight, Ernest 
Hemingway joins up with 
his fellow young Ameri
cans and serves in the Red 
Cross as an ambulance 
driver.
His eagerness for action 
eventually overcomes him, 
and he goes into the battle
field, where he is wounded 
in action.
Hemingway is sent to a 
Red Cross hospital where 
he meets Agnes von 
Kurowsky, played by 
Sandra Bullock.
Hemingway immediately 
abandons his dreams of 
battle to try to win her 
affections over his rivals 
Doctor Carracciolo
(Emilio Bonucci) and 
Hemingways friend
1996 New Line Productions 
Ernest (Chris O'Donnell) and Agnes (Sandra Bullock) share a tender 
moment in In Love and War.
Henry (Mackenzie Astin). 
Henry soon admits defeat, 
while Agnes find herself 
falling in love with 
Hemingway.
When he discovers that 
he is being repatriated to 
America, Hemingway 
pledges his love to Agnes, 
and they understand that 
this is more than a brief 
affair.
When Hemingway re
turns to America, he is 
treated as a war hero. 
Meanwhile, in Italy, 
Agness emotions are split. 
Agnes must choose be
tween the dashing Italian 
doctor and the young 
American who has stolen 
her heart.
In the screenplay, 
ODonnell is quoted, The 
love story is so emotional, 
it really stands on its own. 
This may be true of the
story in itself, but unfortunately I didnt 
see it. In the movie that I saw, there 
wasnt any chemistry between the two 
actors. It didnt even look as if Ernest 
Hemingway and Agnes von Kurowsky 
liked one another. Need I stress how 
important that is in love story?
The overuse of melodramatic music 
emphasized the poorly written dialogue. 
Instead of letting the few tender mo
ments be, the movie is filled with annoy
ing, sappy music. It emphasizes the fact 
that the relationship between the two 
primary characters isnt strong enough 
to support the moments without the 
music.
This movie is still a touching love 
story despite the flaws it has. And the 
historical aspects of the movie added 
to my overall enjoyment of the story: I 
learned a few things about the life of 
Ernest Hemingway, as I knew abso
lutely nothing when I went into the 
theatre.
Id recommend waiting until this 
movie comes out on video before you see 
it. Its cheaper.

movies you may have seen before.....

Thursday, February 6
Rebel Without a Cause
Nine out of ten dentists agree: when asked What 
are you rebelling against?, they say: My dog!
What are you rebelling against Mr. Birdie-boy? You 
think youre so hot with your j acket and your big hat. 
Well, Ill tell you what, big guy. You can just put this 
in your pipe and smoke it: this movie stars James 
Dean.
See, this is the mother of all high-school angst 
flicks: Dean plays a rebel who runs around scoffing 
the law and thumbing his nose in the face of adver
sity. There was this one Simpsons episode, I think, 
that was based on the movie, which is pretty cool. I 
like the Simpsons. Theyre funny.

Naked Lunch
See, theres this guy named Bill Lee (played by the 
guy who played Robocop) who is based on William S. 
Burroughs, who wrote the book, Naked Lunch. OK. 
Standby to standby: Bill Lee is hooked on smack or 
bug powder or something. Hes also a writer. He 
hangs out with a bunch of beets poets (look for 
references to Allen Ginsburg and Jack Palance, two 
famous beets). See, beets poets were called beets 
poets because, well, because they ate beets. They 
were poor, in those days. Money wasnt worth as 
much as it is now.
Anyway, Bill Lee goes off into the Interzone, which 
is somewhere between Crackville and Doobieburg. 
Bill starts to write on a typewriter thats really a 
cockroach. He watches demons have sex. He never 
has a single naked lunch, which is a gyp.

The Ghost and the Darkness
In the language of the Zoop-Y-Flies of inner and 
outer Boodrangle, the word peanut translates as, 
Bite me, you scum-sucking eater of questionable 
ethnic foods. Knowing this will allow the viewer to 
better understand The Ghost and the Darkness, 
which stars Michael look at my butt Douglas.
Iceman comes swooping down in an F-14, wearing 
a black plastic suit that exaggerates his crotch, while 
singing something about breaking on through to 
someones pie. I think you should just eat pie and let 
someone else do the breaking on through. The whole 
story takes place on a large aircraft carrier made to 
look like the Serengeti, but the set is pretty transpar
ent because everything keeps bobbing up and down. 
Made me puke. The Hon did just fine.

Videodrome
James Woods is a goddamned creep, dont you 
think? Actually, I dont give a caterpillars bunghole 
what you think  you can just eat peanuts!
This supposedly fanciful story, about a pirate cableTV programmer (Woods) who starts having halluci
nations as a result of weird cable emissions, is actu
ally pretty interesting. The problem is that, as you 
watch it, you eventually come to the understanding 
that its all about you. You. Its about you. Its meta
phorical, bird-brain. Its social commentary and the 
comments are about you, you half-cocked, quasisentient excuse for a homo sapien.
Images flashing! Cars crashing! Stupid talk-show 
hosts talking and talking! Stupid talk-show guests 
lying and lying! Faces melting, babies screaming, 
hearts pounding ... were being mesmerized! Watch 
this movie. Watch this movie. Watch this.....

Friday Night DOOM
by Dizzy Murphy
Hey folks, and welcome to an
other semester of Friday Night 
DOOM. During the winter break, 
I picked up a couple of games that 
might spark your interest. One of 
them that you may already know 
goes by the name of Diablo. The 
other one is from Origin and its 
Privateer 2.
Diablo is one of the best de
signed games Ive seen yet and 
anyone who enjoys computer 
games should buy it.
Ill explain what its based on. 
You are a fighter/rogue/sorcerer 
(you choose which class of char
acter you want to be) who is try
ing to get rid of monsters in a 
friendly town.
You will have to venture into 
dungeons, caves, catacombs, and 
Hell itself to fight off the mon
sters. Along the way youll grow 
in strength and other categories, 
allowing you to face stronger en
emies.
The play control cannot be 
easier. You just use your mouse 
to do nearly everything and it is 
easy to learn. The graphics are 
crisp and clear and the sounds 
and music set the tone perfectly.
However, the best facet of 
Diablo is its multi-player capa
bility. Whether you have room
mates or are by yourself, Diablo 
has a multi-player option for you. 
You may play by modem, by local 
network, or by the awesome 
Battle.Net where you can find 
literally thousands of other play
ers looking for partners to ven
ture down.
Every time you play the game, 
its different, and there are so 
many items to find that it is very 
hard to stop once you start play
ing this game. I got all three of my 
roommates addicted in less than 
a week.
Now, getting back to business, 
pun intended, is Privateer 2. In 
this game you play a freelancer 
space pilot (like Han Solo) who is 
out to make money by carrying 
cargo or accomplishing errands
for people in trouble.
Problem is, youve lost your 
memory and there are people out 
there who may help you find out 
who you are. But youll have to 
search through the entire galaxy 
to find them.
Like nearly every Origin game, 
many of the scenes in Privateer 
are live action. A decent cast was 
chosen for this film, including the
Like nearly every other flying 
game, a joystick is a must for this 
one. Play control is smooth and 
should be easy to get involved in. 
However, the real kicker on Pri
vateer is the trading, something 
that Origin made very hard to get 
used to. There are many planets 
to travel and choosing which com
modities to take to which planet 
is a pain, since you are always
"... it is very hard to stop once you 
start playing this game. I got all three 
of my roommates addicted in less 
than a week. 
infamous Christopher Walken. 
The acting is very well done, with 
Clive Owen playing the part of 
the privateer with amnesia. The 
space flying engine, compared to 
other Origin games like Wing 
Commander IV, has improved 
drastically, and it is a true beauty 
to watch.
The computer requirements to 
play this game have increased. 
Now you need at least a P75 to 
play the game. Pity.
trying to make a profit, not lose 
money. The game is a bit rocky to 
get used to in the beginning, but 
after you make a couple of cargo 
trips, the game becomes much 
more entertaining.
I recommend this game for 
those of you who like economics 
and a little action on the side. 
Next time Ill be back with 
one of the most eagerly anticipated games this year: X-Wing \ 
vs. Tie Fighter!!!!!
Shadow Conspiracy fails to provide suspense
By DAVID ELMAN
Tartan Staffwriter
While the rest of the world 
watched Star Wars last Friday, I 
sat in a darkened theater with a 
few other souls and took in 
Shadow Conspiracy. Although 
it doesnt have forces of good and 
evil dueling in exotic locales, 
Shadow Conspiracy does have a 
Washington power struggle, and 
well, a conspiracy.

Iiat: Shadow Conspiracy 
Director:George Cosmatos 
Company: Hollywood 
Pictures
As the film opens, we see a 
group of intellectuals at a nice 
waterfront home, reading, work
ing on their computers, and then 
being terminated with extreme 
prejudice. However, one escapes 
and manages to contact a friend 
in government.
Charlie Sheen plays Bobby 
Bishop, a presidential advisor 
who learns of the shadow con
spiracy, seconds before his con
versational companion dies. All 
of a sudden, he finds himself 
chased by a calculating killer, 
set up for a string of killings, and 
rekindling a relationship with 
his old girlfriend (Linda 
Hamilton) who just happens to
and his mentor.
Sadly, I found 
many weaknesses 
in the film. Those 
who have seen 
many thrillers will 
recognize familiar 
elements, includ
ing a psycho killer, 
many technologi
cal gadgets, and 
conveniently oc
curring events that 
keep our hero safe.
Oddities such as 
a luxury hotel next 
to a power plant 
banished my sense 
of reality, while the 
plot never fully de
veloped. At the end 
of the film, I was 
left wondering 
what exactly the

sense of plausibility of their 
events and strong characters with 
clear motives.
After these details are left be

The rest of the 
cast walk 
through their 
roles with nary 
a distinguishing 
characteristic.
Despite all 
this, the movie 
was hardly unenjoyable. If the 
silliness of a sup
posedly serious 
plot can be over
looked, Shadow 
Conspiracy will 
take your mind 
off your troubles. 
When was the 
last time some
one with a 
rather large gun 
was stalking 
you?
However, ir 
all honesty 
while Shadow Conspiracy has 
some tense moments of action, 
overall it doesnt maintain the 
adrenaline rush of films such as 
In the Line of Fire, and therefore 
becomes only a pleasant viewing 
experience rather than some 
thing more.

presented, including source mu
sic, and alternate tracks which 
have never been released.
1997 will bring the Star Wars 
Trilogy back to the big screen. It 
will also bring 6 CDs full of all the 
music from the Special Editions 
of the films. Some people (myself 
included) own the 4 CD 
Soundtrack Anthology which was 
released in 1993. Do not despair, 
and do not sell it off. The Anthol
ogy contains music that isnt 
found on the new releases, and is 
already a collectors item. But the
Anthology, in combination with 
the new releases, will result in 
10 CDs devoted to music from 
the Star Wars Trilogy, which is 
more than anyone could have 
imagined. George Lucas is now 
in pre-production on the Prequel 
Trilogy (Chapters 1-3), and ex
pect to begin releasing them in 
1999. It is rumored that Will
iams will compose the music for 
the new trilogy, and rightfully 
so. So dont put away your check
book so quickly  we will have 
more music to buy in just two 
more years.
