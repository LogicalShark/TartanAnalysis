Report updates minority issues
By NICOLE BROCKMANN
Tartan News Editor
The Human Relations Com
mission has released a report 
detailingthe commissions efforts 
to ameliorate minority status on 
campus. But some students are
not completely happy with the 
progress that the HRC has made 
in dealing with many minority 
issues.
The 16-page report includes in
formation on University-wide, 
academic, student support, en
rollment, and community out
reach initiatives to enhance the 
minority environment.
I dont see much change from 
last semester, saidLeRoy Jones, 
executive vice-president of Spirit. 
Also, the things that I saw that 
changed from last year werent 
really mentioned in here that I
could tell.
I think that everything that 
has happened has been reflected 
in the report, said Vice President 
for Enrollment William F. Elliott, 
chair of the HRC. These are 
facts.
Jones, a senior computer sci
ence major, gave the example of 
the freshman course in minority 
studies which was offered last 
year. The report doesnt really 
say much about it, he said. Weve 
been meeting and fighting trying 
to get it repeated, and it looks like

FCC spurs 
phone 
changes

Tartan Assistant News Editor
New regulations proposed by the 
Federal Communications Commission 
may make it possible for dormitory 
residents to choose their own long-distance telephone service.
Under the new regulations, colleges 
and universities would be forbidden to 
engage in an agreement that charges all 
long-distance calls from a dormitory to 
one company. Many colleges and uni
versities across the country have already 
entered into these agreements, which 
can have financial benefit for the schools 
as well as the long distance companies.
Unfair and expensive are words be
ing used by higher-education officials 
across the country to describe the pro
posals. Public-interest groups and some 
members of congress reply that schools 
are just trying to make an extra buck.
The groups affected by the new regu
lations, dubbed call aggregators, are 
defined by the FCC as entities that have 
telephones available for their customers, 
patrons, or other transient users. The 
regulations would place limits on 
agreements between call aggregators and 
telephone companies:
Call aggregators could no longer use 
call blocking, in which the phones only 
connect with one companys longdistance 
service.
Phones would have to be marked, 
probably with a label, with a statement 
of the users freedom to choose any long 
distance service.
Telephone companies could not pay 
fees to aggregators for blocking out other 
long-distance services.
The FCC says that the regulations 
would increase competition and decrease 
rates for long-distance service.

sculpture major, says, Im kind of

Senate chair

Kappa Alpha Theta will 
receive money for the Mr. 
Fraternity contest again 
this year after Student 
Senate Chair Chris Neigh
bor passed the funding re
quest at Tuesday nights 
Senate meeting by the 
discretion of the chair.
However, the price that 
Neighbor pays for his ac
tions may be impeachment.
According to CIT Senator 
Doug Rubinstein, a petition 
is being circulated to call for 
Neighbors resignation. 
Rubinstein, who currently 
chairs Senates Rules com
mittee, plans to resign at
tomorrows meeting if 
Neighbor remains chair.
Out of 17 voting mem
bers present at the meet
ing, nine voted in favor of 
funding, five voted against, 
and three abstained. Be
cause funds from Mr. Fra
ternity will go to the 
charitable Karen Johnson 
Fund, passing the measure 
would have required a 2/3 
vote to override fiscal 
policy, which prohibits 
Senate funding of events 
which give their proceeds 
to charity. According to' 
Neighbor, since abstaining' 
votes are not considered, 
part of the total vote count, 
the vote was effectively .

The search for a new 
president at Pitt to replace 
current president Wesley 
Posvar has been cluttered 
by a war of words between 
the Student Government 
Board and The Pitt News.
Following President of 
SGB Julie Shepards ap
pointment of sophomore 
Lisa Campoli to the Presi
dential Search Committee, 
The Pitt News criticized 
Shepard for making im
mature and uninformed 
decisions in a front-page
editorial last Monday, say
ing that Shepard selected 
Campoli to further the in
terests of SGB without the 
input of other campus or
ganizations.
Shepard evidently felt 
confident that Campoli will 
serve [Shepards] own in
terests and the interests of 
the SGB effectively. She 
must have felt this way, 
because Shepard did not 
consider a single candidate 
outside the SGB for the po
sition, stated the editorial.
I take full responsibility 
for my decision, said

Student center construction planned for fall 91
By RACHEL HAAS
Tartan Staffwriter
The University Center recep
tion held last Thursday by the 
Faculty and Staff Campaign 
Committee marked the first of a 
line of informal sessions to 
publicize current plans and de
tails of the upcoming University 
Center  and to campaign for 
funds.
With a projected cost of $41 
million, the University Center 
will replace Skibo Hall as the 
center of campus life. According
to Pat Keating, vice president 
for planning and business af
fairs, the Center will contain 
approximately 70,000 more us
able square feet than Skibo. The 
building has been a top priority 
for the administration.
According to Senior Vice 
President and University Cen
ter project manager Ed Schatz, 
construction of the Center  
and demolition of Skibo  is 
expected to begin inlate summer 
or early fall of 1991, and be 
completed by the fall of 1993.
According to Schatz, however,
since Carnegie Mellons Board 
of Trustees, who approved the 
University Center project in 
November of1989, have advised 
that construction of the Uni
versity Center not begin until 
all the necessary funds for the 
project have been raised, 
completion of the center could 
be pushed back one year.
The Board of Trustees real
izes that it is ultimately to the 
advantage of the university not 
to delay construction by one year, 
due to constantly rising con
struction cost, said Schatz.
He went on to say that the 
Board ofTrustees may authorize 
construction to begin even 
without all the funds, because 
the cost of waiting while con
struction fees rise will put even 
more strain on fund-raising.
So far about $8 million has 
been raised for the project. Ac
cording to Carnegie Mellon 
President Robert Mehrabian, 
who spoke at the Thursday re
ception, raising the rest of the 
necessary funds will not be an 
easy task.
Funds [for the proj ect] will be
retrieved externally, said Asso
ciate Vice President for Develop
ment Carol A. Carter. They 
wont be coming from tuition 
payments or university savings. 
According to Carter, an over
whelming amount of those funds 
already raised for the project 
have come from individuals  
mainly Carnegie Mellon alumni.
Additionally, Mehrabian, who 
Schatz described as highly com
mitted to the project, has been 
traveling across the country to 
solicit funds from alumni.

CMU ranks 22nd in U.S. 
News annual college listing
By JENNIFER KERSTEIN
Tartan Magazine Editor
Carnegie Mellon is ranked 
among the top 25 academic insti
tutions in the country, according 
to the October 15 issue of U.S. 
News and World Report, which 
hits newsstands today.
According to the study, Carn
egie Mellon ranks 22nd, just above 
NorthwestemUniversityandjust 
below the University of Michi
gan, in a list which includes the 
most prestigious colleges and
universities in the country.
Don Hale, vice president for 
University Relations, feels that 
the study recognizes the quality 
of what we do here at Carnegie 
Mellon. Although obviously 
pleased with the results, he would 
like to see CMU climb higher on 
the list.
It wont change the way we 
operate, said Hale. The admin
istration will continue to work on 
the areas it feels need improve
ment.
Last year, CMU was listed just
outside the top 25, in a list called 
Up and Coming Schools. Carn
egie Mellon was the only school 
from that list to move up into the 
top 25 for this year. In moving up, 
CMU surpassed Washington 
University, Notre Dame, 
Vanderbilt and Northwestern 
University.
The new position of Carnegie 
Mellon wont affect admissions, 
according to Vice President for 
Enrollment Bill Elliott. Were a 
list-conscious society these days,

Jury clears 
gallery 
director
CINCINNATI (AP)  A 
jury here acquitted an art 
gallery and its director of ob
scenity charges for exhibiting 
sexually graphic photographs 
by the late Robert 
Mapplethorpe.
Dennis Barrie, director of 
the Contemporary Arts Cen
ter, smiled as the verdict was 
read. Spectators in the court
room shouted and applauded, 
and Barrie hugged his law
yers.
In the nations first obscen
ity trial of an art institution, 
the gallery and Barrie were 
acquitted of misdemeanor 
charges of pandering obscen
ity and using children in nu
dity-related material. Barrie 
could have been sentenced to 
one year in jail and fined 
$2,000, and the gallery fined 
$10,000, if convicted of both 
counts.
Federal budget talks founder at Capitol
Budget talks continue to be 
stalled on Capitol Hill as Con
gressional leaders circulate 
whats being called a fill-in-theblanks version of the budget re
jected by lawmakers last week. 
The new package is devoid of 
specific spending levels or tax 
increases.
Democrats predicted a budget 
agreement in time to resume full 
government services by the end of 
the holiday weekend. The Demo
cratic leadership said that the 
agreement will ease medicare cuts 
and excise tax hikes contained in
an earlier deal voted down by the 
house.
The budget resolution being 
worked on is purposely more 
vague than the one voted down 
last week, leaving the tough de
cisions on specific tax hikes and 
budget cuts for later. Democratic 
leaders are hoping that the 
agreement will improve chances 
of getting an agreement on a 
budget outline before the govern
ment shutdown takes full effect 
on Tuesday.
On Sunday, House Democrats 
and Republicans took a break from
their session to hold caucuses on 
the version of the budget plan 
they rejected last week. Said 
Speaker of the House Thomas 
Foley, Theres not a dimes worth 
of tax increases, not ten cents 
worth of cuts in the budget reso
lution.
Congressional committees may 
decide later on specific spending 
levels and tax hikes, and Foley 
predicted that a deal will have 
been struck by today. Other 
democratic leaders said that they 
expect the new package to ease 
proposed medicare cuts and excise
tax increases.
Informal bipartisan budget 
talks continued last night on 
Capitol Hill as the house remained 
on standby to consider any plan 
put before it. Democrats told their 
leaders to go ahead with a plan in 
which the specifics would be filled 
in later. Republicans balked.
As House members worked on 
resolving the budget impasse, 
Republicans and Democrats con
tinued to blame each other for the 
lack of a budget agreement and 
the partial government shutdown. 
House speaker Tom Foley said
President Bushs veto of a bill 
designed to keep the government 
working during negotiations was, 
in Foleys words, A bad mistake.
As a result of the budget stale
mate, many of the monuments 
and museums in the nations 
capital have been closed. In New 
York, tourists are not being wel-. 
corned at the Statue of Liberty. 
Many visitors in Washington D.C. 
and New York are disappointed 
at being locked out of some of the 
countrys most historic sites.

Police fight

street riots
OSAKA, Japan (AP)Riot po
lice and angry laborers main
tained a tense standoff in a run
down neighborhood after four 
days of street fighting over alle
gations of police corruption.
At least 106 people, including 
83 police, have been injured in 
the violence in the Nishinari dis
trict of Osaka that began Tuesday, 
police reported. Forty-one people 
have been arrested.
Up to 1,000 demonstrators 
confronted about 600 riot police 
during the night on streets near 
the Nishinari police station.
The rioting caused traffic tieups in parts of Osaka, as police 
blocked off several major streets 
and some rail service was dis
rupted. Many Nishinari mer
chants closed their shops.
About 350 people remained in 
front of the district police station 
today, intermittently throwing 
stones at ranks of riot police 
standing guard.
LOS ANGELES (AP)  Iraq 
has high-explosive devices that 
pack the equivalent destructive 
power of small nuclear bombs, a 
newspaper reported today.
The fuel-air explosives, orFAEs, 
have 10 times the power of con
ventional explosives and create a 
huge fireball and shock wave over 
a concentrated area, without the 
radiation fallout associated with 
nuclear weapons, The Los Ange
les Times reported,
Its not your garden-variety 
weapon, said Henry Sokolski of 
the Pentagons international se
curity affairs office. These are 
blast-effect weapons, and what 
you cant see can kill you. 
Military officials say the United
States has no ready defense 
against the explosives that could 
devastate oilfields, air bases and 
troops, the newspaper reported.
FAEs can be launched as bombs 
from airplanes or as warheads on 
missiles.
Pentagon officials said U.S. 
forces would have the most diffi
culty defending against a missiledelivered warhead, but there is 
no clear evidence Iraq has the 
ability to mount the explosives on 
missiles.
Senators John Glenn (D-Ohio) 
and Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) are 
among five senators who have 
requested in a letter to Defense 
Secretary Dick Cheney that he 
launch an investigation to deter
mine Iraqs supply of fuel-air ex
plosives.
The Los Angeles Times said 
earlier reports indicated Iraq re
ceived the scientific knowledge to 
build these weapons from the 
German arms industry.
Amajor German aerospace and 
defense firm, MesserschmittBolkow-Blohm, conducted feasi
bility studies on an FAE device as 
part of a missile project with the 
Egyptian government. That 
project was terminated in 1988, 
said company spokesman Willie 
Vogler.
According to reports from the 
BBC and Der Spiegel, a German 
magazine, Egypt gave the studies 
to Iraq.
An unidentified congressional 
investigator told the Times that 
U.S. technology may have been 
involved as well, although the 
United States does not carry FAEs 
in its own arsenal.
The weapons are currently in 
the arsenals of the Soviet Union, 
Israel, China, France, West Gerr, 
man, Spain, and perhaps some 
Third World nations in addition 
to Iraq, according to the Pentagon.
Iraqis murder Kuwaiti family
MANAMA (AP)Iraqi soldiers 
murdered a six-member Kuwaiti 
family, including three children 
and a 70-year-old grandfather, 
because they found a U.S. pass
port in their home, the Saudi Press 
Agency reported today.
The family was shot to death in 
front of a large number of passersby.
An Iraqi occupation force 
searched their home and claimed 
to have located a passport for an 
American national, the agency 
said.
The report, which quoted areport reachingfrom Kuwait and 
which was monitored in Bahrain, 
didnt say when or where the 
killings took place.
Hijacking ends peacefully
HELSINKI, Finland (AP)  
A man who hijacked a Soviet 
airliner to Finland and threat
ened to blow it up surrendered 
after negotiating with authori
ties at Helsinkis International 
Airport Friday morning.
The Soviet news agency Tass 
said the unidentified man, who 
hijacked the plane during a do
mestic flight in the Soviet Union, 
turned out to be unarmed.
The 41-year-old man applied 
for political asylum, Birolainin 
told reporters.
The hijacked Aeroflot Yak-40 
aircraft carried 22 passengers, 
including two children, and a 
crew of four, Finnish authori
ties said.

BONN, Germany (AP)  The 
new Parliament of united Ger
many rescued plans for nation
wide elections on December 2 by 
passing a new balloting law Fri
day during its first working ses
sion.
The legislation replaces an 
election treaty that was rejected 
by the Supreme Court on Sept. 
29. The court said the old treaty 
gave unfair treatment to small 
parties.
A broad majority of government 
and opposition lawmakers ap
proved the new law by a simple 
show of hands.
Parliamentary president Rita 
Suessmuth opened todays ses
sion by welcoming 144 new mem
bers from now-dissolved East 
Germany to the legislative body 
in Bonn. They include 24 from the
former Communist Party, which 
now calls itself the Party for 
Democratic Socialism.
At Fridays session, the new 663- 
member Bundestag immediately 
began debating the new law to 
regulate the first all-German 
elections.
The overruled treaty would 
have required a party to win 5 
percent of the vote across Ger
many to earn a seat in the 
Bundestag. However, it would 
have permitted smaller parties to 
form alliances with larger ones 
and share ballot space, allowing 
them to get the necessary vote.
Lawmakers Friday approved a 
plan that will in effect set up two 
separate election areas in the 
united Germany.
Lawmakers in former East 
Germany will have to receive 5
percent on their own turf, rather 
than polling that amount across 
the united country.
That will give smaller parties 
like the former Communists a: 
better chance of winning parlia
mentary seats.
However, the Party for Demo
cratic Socialism voted against the 
new plan, saying it opposes any 
minimum vote for winning par
liamentary seats.

Request for Special Allocation: 
Kappa Alpha Theta is requesting 
$785 to help fund the annual Mr. 
Fraternity contest. The event is a 
non-profit fundraiser for the 
Karen Johnson Fund. All money 
earned in this event is put into 
the fund and sent to the Central 
Ohio Lung Assoc. Estimated 
charity donation is $1,300.
Two motions were discussed in 
the F&R meeting, one of granting 
the money and one of lending the 
money.
Article 14 of the Fiscal Policy 
states that events that donate 
their proceeds to charity cannot 
be funded by Senate. The last 
article also states that Senate can 
override the Fiscal Policy at any
time with a 2/3 vote. It should 
be pointed out that Theta has 
received this allocation in the 
past years. Representatives 
from Theta felt that they were 
being led on.
At the discretion of the Chair, 
discussion was closed.
Student Senate Approval: A 
motion was made to vote with 
three objections. A motion was 
made to make this a roll call 
vote. Vote: 9-5-3.
At this point, the chair said

it wont be repeated. Thats acause 
of deep concern.
Jones was concerned with the 
inclusion of the CMAP and tu
toring programs in the report. 
Some of the things that are 
mentioned in here are things that 
have already been established.... 
CMAP and the tutoring program 
have already been in existence 
for a long time, and putting them 
in this report makes it sound like 
its a new occurence.
According to Jones, periodic 
updates of progress on minority 
issues had been requested from 
the HRC via the Black Students 
Advisory Council, and none had 
ever materialized.
This seems like something 
more to appease us, he said. The 
increase of African-American 
members on the security force is 
commendable, and Id like to 
thank [Director of Security] Jim 
LaPaglia for that.
Hajime Ando, a member of the 
HRC and leader of the student 
organization Focal Point, also 
doesnt feel that the work that the 
HRC has done responds suffi
ciently to minority concerns.
To tell the truth, I really dont 
feel its adequate enough yet, said 
Ando, asophomorehistorymajor. 
Its been the first year for the 
commission and weve been deal
ing a lot with fundamental is
sues.
Im certainly not satisfied un
til weve reached some level of 
acceptance on all parts, said 
Elliott. Were continuingto work 
on a variety of fronts.
Elliott cited harassment via the 
electronic bboards as one issue 
which the HRC will continue to 
address.
According to Ando, there are 
several areas to which the HRC 
needs to devote more specialized 
attention. One of these areas is 
the problems that female students 
face in male-dominated depart
ments.
I think that from now on, as far 
as I know, we are going to be 
recommending subcommittees to 
look into some of these minority 
issues, he said.
Ando said that the HRC has 
made much more progress in 
terms of technical things, like 
changing the Universitys State
ment of Assurance, than in actual 
improvements of campus life.
According to Ando, there are 
only four student representatives 
on the HRC. Ando and fellow 
member Terence Yarde of Spirit 
were appointed to the committee 
by then-Student Government 
President Mark Mittelhauser. 
The other two members for the 
1989-90 year were Yash Gupta 
and Jessica Halow.
I would like to see more student
participation on the commission, 
Ando said. Im not sure that its 
reaching out to students enough, 
he said.
The commission was formed a 
little over a year ago to address 
issues highlighted by campus 
protests by minority students. It 
met five times during the 1989- 
90 academic year.
The first meeting, held last No
vember, reviewed the purpose of 
the committee and identified ar
eas to address, including sexual 
harassment, gender harassment, 
ethnic harassment, and the role 
of the HRC to protect and edu
cate the campus community.
The report praised the increas
ing involvement of student orga
nizations with minority issues. It 
especially praised the Black 
Graduate Student Organization, 
the Womens Center, Focal Point, 
and the Chinese Graduate Stu
dent Organization.
I think weve seen considerable 
enhancement in terms of student 
involvement in these issues, said 
Dean of Student Affairs Michael 
Murphy.
Murphy also praised the 
Womens Center for its initiative, 
in addition to Spirit andcmuOUT. 
Students are really assisting with 
general cultural awareness, he 
said.
The report is available at the 
Skibo Information Desk.

choosing already. I use a calling 
card that charges my phone calls 
to my house, so I dont think that 
new laws would change anything. 
I think [the FCC] should stay 
out of it, said freshman biology 
major Ralph Cartagena. The 
rates we get no w are pretty cheap, 
and the increase would probably 
hurt students. Even if Carnegie 
Mellon is making money, too, its
okay. Were the beneficiaries of 
the money sooner or later.
Accordingto F. William Orrick, 
president of the Association of 
College and University Telecom
munication administrators, the 
regulations could cause additional 
costs for many universities and 
colleges. The purchase of new 
equipment to comply with the 
regulations could be expensive.
Another possible rate increase
evolves from the fact that the vol
ume discounts now offered to stu
dents  such as the ones offered 
at Carnegie Mellon  would no 
longer be available.
The FCC is currently accepting 
comments on the proposals and 
then will decide whether to not to 
implementthem. Even if the FCC 
decides not to proceed, legislation 
being draftedin congress could do 
the same thing.
Carnegie Mellon in Brief
Campus network gets upgrade
Carnegie Mellon recently upgraded the Andrew campus 
network, increasing the network speed by over a factor of fifty.
The upgraded equipment has increased the capacity from 10 
million bits per second (Mbps) to 530 Mbps.
Every building and cluster on campus is a Local Area Net
work (LAN); there are 60 in all. Each LAN is connected to a room 
in the basement of UCC via one of 30 bridges and routers, which 
then feed into the main router. This is known as an inverse 
backbone configuration.
The advantage of an inverted backbone is having all the 
routers and bridges located at a central site. John Leong, Direc
tor of Networking and Communications, said, This is a very 
cost-effective, high-speed backbone for a network configured to 
exploit its potential.
Another advantage of the new system is the potential for 
sending more video images across the net.
An article in the September 3 issue of Communications Week 
states, A unique blend of local are network routers has let 
Carnegie Mellon University increase the speed of its backbone 
network, possibly making it the worlds fastest.
Health Services offers HIV 
and flu testing for students
Health Services is offering anonymous HIV testing to Carnegie 
Mellon students. The test is $20 and by appointment.
Anyone taking the HTV test will be given pre- and post-test 
counseling. The pretest counseling serves two purposes. The 
nurse practitioner or the staff physician will explore the various 
risk groups in which the student belongs. The second aspect of the 
pretest is an explanation of the test itself  what the test can and 
cannot reveal.
After the test is administered the student will undergo post
test counseling. The nurse or doctor will review the meaning of 
the test results and safer future behavior. Should the test results 
be positive, the Health Center will direct the student to expert 
medical attention as well as support groups in the community.
The Health Center is also offering will be a flu clinic. Nurses at 
the clinic will be administering free flu shots to the students and 
faculty on October 25 from 8:30 am to 4:30 pm in Skibo 13.
Anita Barkin, director of Health Services, said, This is the 
time of year to give the flu vaccine. The cold and flu season is 
approaching and the body requires several weeks to form suffi
cient antibodies.
SUPA professor speaks at 
European conference
Donald Stone, distinguished public service professor at the 
School of Urban and Public Affairs, attended the International 
Partnership Initiatives Congress on September 12 to 14. The 
conference was held in Wolfsburg, Germany. There, Stone 
proposed a modified Marshall Plan for assisting Eastern 
Europe.
Among the speakers present were Chancellor Helmut Kohl of 
West Germany, the prime minister of France, the chief economic 
advisor to Mikhail Gorbachev, and the president of the European 
Community.
At the conference, Stone discussed how the Marshall Plan may 
be relevant to Eastern Europe today. He described the differing 
problems of Eastern European countries and stressed the need 
for stable governments, convertible currencies and improving 
physical infrastructures."
Stone helped to develop the original Marshall Plan, which 
was intended to rebuild post-World War II Europe.
CDEC wins educational 
software award
Preston Covey and Lisa Leizman, of Carnegie Mellons Center 
for Design of Educational Computing, have won one of seven 
1990 EDUCOM/NCRIPTAL Higher Education Software Awards. 
Their program Art or Forgery? The Strange Case of Hans Van 
Meegeren received the award for Best Humanities Software.
EDUCOM is a non-profit consortium of more than 600 colleges 
and universities which addresses itself to computing and commu
nications issues in higher education. NCRIPTAL is The National 
Center for Research to Improve Postsecondary Teaching and 
Learning. The Higher Education Software Awards program has 
been in existence since 1987.
The software which Covey and Leizman wrote uses an Apple 
Macintosh and a video-disk player. The student using the pro
gram is first shown a video gallery of acknowledged art works __ 
and of possible forgeries. The student then must compare the 
use of detail, light and composition in the art, to decide who 
painted each picture.
A national panel of 36 judges met for four days to evaluate the 
1990 entrees. The judges represented all major discipline catego
ries and included experts in instructional design.
The award for Best Humanities Software will be presented at 
the EDUCOM national conference October 15, in Atlanta.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  8 October 19905
Fundraising controls University Center schedule
CENTER, from page 1
In order to interest alumni and friends 
of the university to contribute, however, 
the immediate campus community itself 
needs to generate enthusiasm and inter
est for the center, according to the Fac
ulty and Staff Campaign Committee.
Support from alumni and friends of 
the university can be increased by a 
positive reaction to the University Cen
ter, Mehrabian said.
According to Mehrabian, Carnegie 
; Mellons student, staff, and faculty 
population has risen 60 percent in the 
past 15 years, but there has been no 
parallel trend in faculty and staff invest
ment in campus facilities.
According to Schatz, the Faculty and 
Staff Campaign Committees goal is to 
raise $1 million from faculty and staff so 
that alumni, knowing that current staff 
and faculty have contributed funds as 
well, will be more willing to donate to the 
University Center.
The architects of the project are Michael 
Dennis and Associates, a Boston firm, 
and the Urban Design Association, lo
cated in Pittsburgh. Dennis, who also 
designed the East Campus Project, was 
the winner of a 1984 contest to design a 
campus master plan.
One of the principal architects of the 
University Center is UDAs Don Carter, 
who is a 1967 graduate of the Carnegie 
Mellon Department of Architecture. Five 
other graduates from Carnegie Mellon 
are also working on the project.
W.W. Cooper University Professor of 
Economics and Public Policy Otto Davis 
said that while taking his college-aged 
children to evaluate other universities 
and campuses across the country, he 
observed that the facilities at many of 
those universities are better than those 
at Carnegie Mellon.
This is why we have to pay particular 
attention to the University Center, Davis 
said.
Michael Ewedosh, chair of the Univer
sity Capital Projects Student Advisory 
Committee, agreed. Improvement of life 
here at Carnegie Mellon hinges on this 
University Center, he said.
According to Schatz, the University 
Center, although it will not be the larg
est building on campus in terms of the 
total square feet, will leave the largest 
architectural footprint on campus, since 
there are only three floors to divide the 
square footage of the building between.
An eight or nine foot wide columned 
walkway, called a loggia, will traverse 
the entire side of the building which 
faces the Cut. The loggia will open into 
two main lobbies, a two-story book store, 
a convenience store equivalent to Skibos 
Entropy, a chapel, several offices, a quiet 
study room, and other areas.
These areas will comprise only about 
one-quarter of the first and busiest floor, 
which will also house a gymnasium, 
squash and racquetball courts, and a
450-seat auditorium for classes, lectures, 
campus movies, and other activities and 
performances. A natatorium which is 
roughly as big as the entire first floor of 
Hunt Library will also be located there.
The main entrance of the building will 
be located on the southern side. The 
entrance will open into a courtyard, with 
a rotunda which will pass through all 
three floors.
The second floor will contain all the 
dining facilities of the University Cen
ter, including a two-story Scotland Yard, 
a five-module food court which may in
clude outlets of national food chains, and 
a dining area that overlooks the pool 
below.
Also on the second floor will be a weight 
room, which, along with the gymnasium, 
will overlook the football field.
The Centers third floor will consist 
largely of rooms for student organiza
tions, and, according to Schatz, will offer 
more space for most of these organiza
tions than Skibo does.
Most students are looking forward to 
the University Center, although some 
have expressed doubt that it will be com
pleted on or near schedule, and some 
others are just plain disappointed that 
they wont be around to use it.
A lot of students and faculty members', 
according to Schatz, seem particularly 
enthusiastic about the new athletic fa
cilities that will installed in the center. 
The new facilities will be mainly for 
recreational purposes.
The only varsity sport which will be 
housed in the Center will be the swim
ming team, which does not currently 
have adequate facilities on campus. The 
Thistle Hall gym will remain the home of 
other team and club activities.
According to the University, however, 
the upcoming University Center will 
not simply be a gym or student union ... 
it will be a center for the entire campus 
community.

6The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  8 October 1990
Neighbor moves to fund charity
SENATE, from page 1
nine out of fourteen in favor.
Two-thirds of fourteen votes is 
9.33 votes. With only nine votes,
; Senate achieved a 64 percent vote 
 in favor.
Just as in a tie-breaking situa
tion, it is up to the discretion of 
the chair as to whether he rounds 
up or rounds down, said Neigh
bor. Neighbor decided to approve 
funding, even though Senate did 
not achieve the full 2/3 vote.
According to Roberts Rules of 
Order, the handbook of parlia
mentary procedure that deter
mines how Senate meetings are 
run, Neighbors decision is within 
the bounds of proper presiding 
officers conduct.
Roberts Rules states that If, 
without the chairs vote, the num
ber in the affirmative is one less 
than twice the number in the 
negative ... the chair, if a mem
ber, can vote in the affirmative 
I and thus cause the motion to be 
adopted.
Neighbors approval of the re
quest has sparked a furor of an;gry remarks from Senators.
I think it undermines the whole 
idea of voting in Senate, said 
Rubinstein, a senior electrical and 
computer engineering major. It 
essentially changes the idea of a 
two-thirds majority, and makes it 
a two-thirds majority minus one. 
You dont have to get a two-thirds 
majority anymoreyou just have 
to get close. I really think [Neigh
bor] just tried to railroad it 
through.
Rubinstein abstained from the 
vote because he wanted them to 
lhave the money, but I couldnt 
quite justify overriding the fiscal 
policy for it.
CIT Senator and senior chemi
cal engineering major Mark 
Shaeffer noted Senates shortage
You don't have to get a two-thirds 
majority anymore  you just have to

of funds as another reason that 
Mr. Fraternity should not be 
funded. We dont have very much 
money right now to give out, he 
said.
But Neighbor stands behind his 
decision. Mr. Fraternity is be
coming a tradition. Weve killed 
too many traditions, he said. Its 
also an event that a lot of people 
attend; therefore, its worth fi
nancing in my mind.
As far as I can tell, its one of 
the larger-drawing events on 
campus, said H&SS Senator 
Stew Barnes. Barnes, a senior
applied history major, was one of 
the nine who supported funding 
the event. It supports the cam
pus community and only periph
erally supports a charity, he said.
Neighbor said that the event 
will also help Carnegie Mellon 
improve the overall quality of life 
and that it may help ameliorate 
Senate-Greek relations.
I think it merits funding be
cause it significantly enhances 
campus life, added Student Gov
ernment President Kishore Rao.
It does show that Senate will 
give the Greeks the time of day,
he said.
I do believe that there is an 
anti-Greek bias on Senate, and I 
would like to see that ended, said 
Barnes. I want to get rid of all of 
the animosity between Greeks 
and anti-Greeks.
Barnes hopes that the fiscal 
policy will be rewritten to support 
funding of all events which ben
efit the campus community.
Frankly, I think its written 
poorly, he said. It shouldnt 
matter whether an event is Greek 
or for charity  just whether or 
not it benefits the campus com
munity.... The only criteria [for 
funding] should be if it benefits 
the campus community as a 
whole, and since [Mr. Fraternity] 
allows everyone to enter it, I think 
that it does.
Nine Senators were absent from 
Tuesdays meeting. If they had 
been present, Barnes said, I 
would tend to doubt that [the 
motion] would have passed, or 
that [Neighbor] could have called 
it passing.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  8 October 19907
Pitt factions debate appointment
SHEPARD, from page 1
Shepard. I see nothing wrong 
with the person Ive chosen or the 
process by which I went about it. 
I think that there were many 
things that The Pitt News did not 
consider.
Shepard said that she seriously 
considered six to seven people. 
All but one were SGB, she added.
Campoli fears that the contro
versy has reduced the focus on 
the presidential search itself. Its 
unfortunate that the idea that 
were looking for a new president 
for this university is being over
shadowed by a conflict I dont 
think was accurately portrayed, 
she said.
According to an accompanying 
article in The Pitt News, leaders 
of such minority student organi
zations as the Black Action Soci
ety have harshly criticized 
Shepards appointment of 
Campoli.
Doug Ligons, chairperson of 
BAS, was quoted in The Pitt News 
as saying, In the desire to maxi
mize convenience and maximize 
influence, [SGB] chose a member 
of its own. It would have been a 
big inconvenience for them to try 
to get a consensus from all of the 
groups, even though that would 
have been the right way.
Shepard expressed concern over 
the ability of a representative se
lected from a minority group to 
fully understand issues not re
lating to their groups agenda.
If you put someone who has a 
very focused agenda on something 
like this, said Shepard, I dont 
think they will necessarily take 
all interests besides their own 
into account. Most Pitt students 
happen to be white and hetero
sexual. That doesnt mean we 
should discount minority groups, 
but it means we should pick 
someone open to all concerns.
Both Shepard and Campoli feel 
that both The Pitt News editorial 
and the accompanying story were 
strongly biased.
Im sure that if [The Pitt News] 
had a choice, theyd pick one of 
their own, said Shepard, but I 
dont think he or she would rep
resent the interests of all students. 
Look at the entertainment sec"This is probably the most important 
decision the student government 
board has had to make in the last 25 
years.... The representative is the 
one voice the students have, and she 
just... poof! No consideration of the 
students. 
 Scot Ross, 
The Pitt News editor-in-chief
tion and tell me that represents 
all students.
I can only respond to that by 
saying it wasnt biased, said Scot 
Ross, editor-in-chief of The Pitt 
News. It just wasnt. The news 
story was a quality piece of jour
nalism. The reporter did a hell of 
a job ... reporting how the Stu
dent Government Board Presi
dent chose not to pool any re
sources from anyone other than 
student government.
I ask [Shepard] to bring forth 
documented material saying that 
there was some sort of selection 
process, stating exactly who was 
interviewed and why she deter
mined Lisa was the best choice. 
But until she does, the only deter
mination that can be made was 
the one made in the editorial, 
that [the selection process] was a 
sham.
Shepard, who had served as an 
assistant news editor on The Pitt 
News, feels that the editorial and 
news article may have been di
rected at her personally instead 
of in her capacity as SGB presi
dent. I dont know if the editorial 
was personal or not, she said.
Shepard, a senior communica
tions major, resigned from the 
editorial position to run for stu
dent government.
I quit because I decided to run 
for board, she said. I saw it as a 
conflict of interests.
Campoli admitted that personal 
enmity was possible. On a cer
tain level, I think [the article and 
editorial] were personal, said

is by far the most critical cover
age I have ever seen in The Pitt 
News of anything. I think they 
were more critical of my appoint
ment than that of Judge Souter.
When asked if the previous re
lationship between Shepard and 
The Pitt News was involved in the 
editorial, Ross answered no. 
When she quit, she was in charge 
of recruiting people, he said. She 
wasnt even an assistant news 
editor. To say that had something 
to do with it is absolutely ludi
crous.
The fact that we were strong in 
the editorial means that we have 
an opinion about it, said Ross. 
Were students of the university, 
and the appointee process of the 
student government board is an
unsound way to make determi
nations.
This is probably the most im
portant decision the student gov
ernment board has had to make 
in the last 25 years. This could 
have a bearing on the next 25 
years of the University of Pitts
burgh. The representative is the 
one voice the students have, and 
she just... poof! No consideration 
of the students.
Its my understanding that the 
editor of The Pitt News sent a 
letter to Julie expressing his 
opinion that someone on The Pitt 
News staff should be on the search 
committee, said Campoli. Ifthey 
were interested in having some
one from their staff on it, thats a 
bias right there.
Thats absolutely ridiculous, 
said Ross. The people of The Pitt 
News are students. We have ev
ery right to be considered. To say 
that since I feel that my newspa
per was shunned, Im going to 
write an editorial and slam them 
is ridiculous.
I sent a letter to Julie in midJune that told her that [the ap
pointment] is our responsibility. 
Were in touch with the issues 
that concern students. I said that 
I would like to be considered for 
the appointment, as well as any
one on my staff. Julie sent a letter 
back stating that at this point 
and time, she couldnt give me 
any certain answers. She prom
ised to let me know as soon as 
things come up. The next thing 
we know, Lisa is chosen on Sep
tember 18.

he said. Even so, Elliott went on 
to say he feels the survey sim
ply confirmed what people al
ready felt.
U.S. News and World Report 
bases its rankings on different 
criteria every year, but the gen
eral reaction seems to be that 
the study has become more ac
curate since it first began in 
1983. That year, Carnegie 
Mellon ranked 11th.
This year, 1,374 four-year 
schools were ranked. The list is 
based on statistical data and 
the results from a survey of 
4,131 college presidents, deans, 
and admissions directors. The 
surveys focus on the schools 
academic reputations.
The major component used to 
rank the best colleges on the 
list was information provided 
by the schools about their stu
dent body and faculty. The
scores on reputation from the 
survey were also considered.
CMU ranked 24th in aca
demic reputation, but only 54th 
in student selectivity. Ironically, 
even though Carnegie Mellon 
is less selective in choosing its 
students, its applicants had 
higher average test scores than 
some of the more selective 
schools.
Financial resources were im
portant in the rating system. 
CMU ranked 18th, ahead of 
such noted schools as Brown 
and Penn. Student satisfaction, 
where CMU ranked 27th, was 
factored into the overall score.
Being one of the 25 highestranking schools in the nation is 
a pat on the back for Carnegie 
Mellon, but, according to Hale, 
there is farther up to go. As he 
put it, We want to move up. As 
in everything else, we want to 
do better.

Responsibly; HRC reports no progress
When individual students strive 
for changes at CMU, university 
administrators trying to preserve 
the status quo have an important 
advantage  the brevity of the 
student bodys collective memory.
Over a four year span, the stu
dent body is almost completely 
renewed. The last witnesses to 
campus conflicts in 1986 were 
smoothly swept out with their di
plomas in 1990, and with them 
any accompanying righteous in
dignation over problems still un
solved.
Administrators and faculty, by 
comparison, have long organiza
tional memories. They can easily 
placate students long enough for 
the flames to die down; form 
committees, study the problem, 
keep it quiet  until the protest
ers have graduated and their 
concerns are forgotten, and where, 
then, is the motivation for change? 
Organizational inertia takes over 
and nothing is done.
During the 1988-89 school year, 
a number of black students staged 
a series of protests, conferences, 
and media events all aimed at the 
problems of racial and ethnic in
equality and insensitivity on 
campus. The students filled the 
Student Affairs offices, met with 
administrators, went on local 
television programs  in short, 
they raised hell with the status 
quo, and raised awareness of mi
nority concerns in the student 
body.
The administrations response 
was predictable: A Human Rela
tions Commission was formed 
under VP for Enrollment William 
Elliott, meetings were scheduled, 
the problem was studied. All this, 
you might think, was just the win
dow dressing for another out-thedoor and under-the-rug gloss job.
Youd be right  with a twist.
What wasnt predictable about 
the HRC was the sudden appear
ance of a printed report, released 
last Monday to the campus, de
tailing the efforts of the HRC over 
the past year.
Elliott and the HRC apparently 
felt that their progress and con
tinuing concerns were of sufficient 
merit to be shown to the campus 
at large. While we applaud the 
commission for releasing the re
port, we dont think it has done 
much.
According to its report, the HRC 
met five times last year. The main
results: a new statement of assur
ance (the Carnegie Mellon does 
not discriminate on the basis of... 
legalese found in all official Uni
versity publications) and new 
policies on harassment. To us, that 
seems like nothing more than 
some new paper to be recycled.
At first glance, the HRCs report 
is pretty impressive. Its thick  
17 pages long if you count the 
cover letter  and filled with 
headings and sub-headings.
But the report is packed with 
filler. It claims credit for CMAP, 
even though that group has been 
on campus since the late sixties. It 
mentions the Womens Center, 
which was a much-needed im
provement, but one that the ad
ministration did not initiate.
Instead, the report details pre
cious little progress in those areas 
that were of concern to the stu
dent protestors during the 1988- 
89 school year. Since then, the 
report says, only one black tenure-track faculty member has 
been added. A pilot course on Di
versity on Americas Campuses 
was offered once, but no other 
similar courses have appeajred. 
And although the report glosses 
this issue, very few new ethnicand gender-related titles have 
been added to the Universitys li
brary holdings.
On the other hand, the univer
sity has made some legitimate 
progress, such as the education of 
the Campus Security force to mi
nority concerns. We commend the 
HRC for its actions so far  wed 
just like to see more.
We welcome the invitation for 
commentary Elliott attached to 
the front of the report, which is 
available just inside Baker Hall, 
at the Skibo Information Desk, 
and at other campus distribution 
sites.
The responsibility lies with us, 
the students, to give Elliott our 
feedback.
To make your concerns known, 
get in touch with Elliott directly. 
His Andrew user-id is wel6, his 
phone number is x2056, and his 
office is on the sixth floor ofW amer 
Hall. If you prefer to bring a con
cern or issue to the attention of 
the entire campus, write us a letter 
to the editor. Our office is in Skibo

Letters to the Editor, The Tartan,

Who cares about top 25 ranking?
Make no doubt about it, the col
lege ranking game is a business  
a big one. Americans seem to want 
to know whos number one in 
higher education, and the national 
media has obliged them with a 
plethora of rankings.
Never mind that universities are 
too complex to be subject to a 
simple better/worse comparison. 
In fact, to the creators of the col
lege ratings know this, and use it 
their advantage: They change 
their statistical methods  and 
hence their final rankings  once 
a year. If the rankings never 
changed, how could the media 
continue to call them news?
For instance, neither Harvard 
nor Stanford has changed drasti
cally in the past twelve months, 
although theyve traded places in 
the annual U.S. News and World. 
Report ratings which hit the 
stands today. Has the weather
improved that much in Cambridge 
recently? Or maybe Stanford lost 
one faculty member too many at 
the end of last school year, just 
enough to tip the scales back to 
the East Coast.
So, while were happy to see that 
U. S. News thinks Carnegie Mellon 
is the 22nd best university in the 
country, were not all that sure 
that the number means anything. 
But it certainly may have an im
pact on next years applications, 
which is certainly good news for 
the school.
We agree with Vice President 
for University Relations Don Hale, 
who says the university would like 
to do better in the future. We 
should always strive for improve
ment.
Lets just hope everyone keeps 
the rankings in perspective and 
continues to concentrate on goals 
worth achieving.

Evangelist expressed narrow views
Letter to 
the Editor
Editor:
In what has al
most become an an
nual tradition, ClifFe 
Knechtle returned 
to CMU last week to 
offer his style of Christian evange
lism. As I listened to him work the 
crowd on Tuesday and Wednesday, a 
question popped into my mind: Who 
speaks for the Christian community? 
And as I thought about that question 
an analogy came to me.
You might compare the Christian 
community to a large choir with many 
individual voices. A choir is often di
vided into several sets of voices (so
prano, alto, tenor, bass, etc.) just as 
the Christian community has subcommunities (Eastern Orthodox, Ro
man Catholic, Lutheran, Baptist, etc.).
Not only are the voices of a choir 
pitched differently, they also sing dif
ferent scores. What comprises the 
beauty of a choir at its best, is the 
harmonic integration of the differences 
of pitch and score to create an aes
thetically appealing, even compelling, 
experience. I would suggest that the 
Christian gospel is most appealing and 
compelling when it is heard as the 
integral harmony of the several tra
ditions which comprise the Christian 
community.
Sometimes choirs have soloists, ei
ther from within their own ranks or as 
invited guests. But if the soloist is a 
tenor, no one assumes that the rest of 
the choir will be made up of tenors. 
Further, the soloists score, while often 
requiring the exercise of exceptional 
skill, is not dissonant with the rest of 
the choir. Instead, it adds a refine
ment, a highlight, a nuance to the 
choral perfommance.
To be sure, there are prima donnas, 
those who seem to believe that the
choir exists to serve as their background 
rather than seeing themselves as an ex
tension of the choir. They may view their 
interpretation of the score as definitive 
and exhibit the attitude that either the 
the choir accepts their interpretation or 
fails to fulfill the intent of the composer.
Listeningto Cliffe, I was struck by how 
narrow an expression of the Christian 
faith he offered. He seemed to suggest 
that his understanding of the origin, 
purpose, and use of the Bible (especially 
the Gospels) or his expression of Chris
tian theology were definitive for all 
Christians.
What he failed to help his audience to 
understand was that his views, while 
falling within the broad domain of the 
Christian choir, was but one sub-set in 
that sea of voices, some of which sing the 
Lords song quite differently. He did not 
invite people to discover where their 
voices might best join similar voices and 
so enrich the whole; rather, he seemed to 
suggest that if his hearers wanted to join 
the Christian choir they would need to 
sing his part as he sang it.
One final observation, and here I must 
leave the choir analogy. As I listened to 
Cliffe I was also troubled by a rhetorical 
style which seemed to me more akin to 
assault than conversation and to the 
sales pitch than to interpersonal dia
logue. Perhaps that is an overly harsh 
judgment, but to my ears Cliffe seemed 
to treat those with whom he spoke as 
ideological adversaries to be either con
quered and won over or demolished.
While such a combative competitive
ness abounds in the world around us, it 
seems somewhat incongruous to me in a 
university setting. Here, I believe, the 
goal of inquiry is not possession of an 
absolute truth, but an ever-enriching 
understanding of a universe which, to 
paraphrase J.B.S. Haldane, is not only 
more wondrous than we imagine but
more wondrous than we can imagine. 
It also seems curious to me for such 
aggressive disregard for the personal 
and intellectual integrity of others to 
be coming from one who presents him
self as giving witness to the Prince of 
Peace.
But to be sure, in all of this I am 
speaking only from the perspective of 
my particular place in the Christian 
choir (post-modern, protestant, re
formed, presbyterian). Those others of 
you who either lend your voices to that 
choir or listen to its songs with inter
est will have to judge for yourselves 
whether Cliffes solo was a gift of 
richness to or a source of dissonance 
within the Lords song.

Tartan neglected details in assault story
on
Letter to 
the Editor
Editor:
We were deeply dis
turbed upon reading 
the article Men As
sault Pitt Student in 
the September 24 is
sue of The Tartan. We feel that The 
Tartans coverage of this incident was 
extremely negligent.
The CMU Campus Police created a 
Crime Alert bulletin on September 17, 
with not only a full description of the 
assault, but of all three suspects as well. 
These flyers were tacked up all over the
walls and elevators of Mellon Institute, 
the building where the crime took place. 
In addition, every RA received a copy to 
post. Why did Rhonda Struminger not 
include this information in her article? 
Why did neither the news editor or the 
editor-in-chief catch and correct her er
ror?
In the interest of informing the stu
dent body, we submit the following re
print of the Carnegie Mellon Campus 
Police Crime Alert document:
Carnegie Mellon Campus Police are 
investigating a report of a sexual assault
at Mellon Institute on Monday, Septem
ber 3,1990 at about 10:30 pm.
This assault occurred when a female 
Pitt student was sitting alone on the 
back of Mellon Institute at the base of 
the pillars on the second level above the 
ground.
Two white males came around the 
back of the building from the Dithridge 
Street side, as the third white male 
came from the Bellefield Street side. The 
victim was dragged between the pillars, 
where she was assaulted.

Stereotyping of the Greek system is non-productive
Letter to 
the Editor
Editor: e7
Recent letters to the 
editor prompt us to 
write a few words in 
defense of our Greek 
system and, particu
larly, our fraternity members.
Fraternities suffer from an animal 
house stereotype that belies their' cen
tral strengths of character and brother
hood. This stereotype is unfortunately 
bought into by some younger and less 
mature members of the houses offering 
enough incidents to allow those so in
clined to believe that misconduct is en
demic to the system. That a few of the 
over 1,000 fraternity members on the 
campus occasionally act in an immature
manner should not be tolerated. It should 
also not be exaggerated.
Greek organization members are in
volved in student government, residence 
life, freshman orientation, the womens 
center, and virtually every student or
ganization. The fraternities provide much 
of the social life, intramural activity, and 
community service on this campus. Greek 
officers and members work hard to ac
centuate the true meaning of brotherhood 
and sisterhood and to enhance the cam
pus community generally.
We do not believe that the Greek sys
tem is without problems, nor do we know 
of any Greek member who believes so. 
We do believe that Greek affiliation is a 
meaningful part of the lives of many of
our students, faculty, and staff.
We hope we can all work together 
constructively to make the Greek system 
on our campus as strong and productive 
as possible.

Say no to government spending
Editor: =- OS
I believe Lui aKav."''
Sieh unknow- ------------------------
ingiy taught Letter to 
himselfalesson the Editor 
in politics in his
column [If youve done your 
homework, youll say yes to new 
taxes, 10/1]. Sieh argued that 
the intelligent thing for Congress 
and President Bush to do would 
be to stop taking cheap political 
shots at each other and to start 
working together. That is good 
advice, but very hard to follow. 
Sieh could not follow it, and he 
spent the rest of his column tak
ing cheap shots at the Republican 
Party and its leadership!
Mr. Siehs shots were unsub
stantiated; mine wont be. The 
threatened cuts to federal pro
grams were not brought about by 
Bushs mismanagement, as Mr. 
Sieh entertained. Rather, these 
cuts were the results of the 
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit
reduction law passed in 1985 by 
Congress. The plan then was to 
decrease or control government 
spending little by little, so that 
these Fiscal Year 1991 budget 
cuts that were put in as a safety 
valve wouldnt have to be enacted.
How did the country get so close 
to the deadline at which the cuts 
were scheduled? The government 
didnt control spending. Mr. Sieh 
realized that over-spending was 
the problem, but attributed the 
cause of this over-spending to 
Bush and the Republicans. The 
Democrats, however, have not 
been willing to cut spending on a 
single appropriations bill 
throughout the entire 101st Con
gress. On the House floor in July, 
Republican Rep. Robert Walker 
of Pennsylvania submitted a pro
test amendment to the agricul
ture appropriations bill which 
would have cut that departments 
funding by .0000001 percent, for 
a total reduction of $19.90. The
Democrats defeated the amend
ment on a strict party vote. Rep. 
Walkers point was well made: 
the Democrats had not let a single 
Republican cut get through all 
session; they had not offered any 
cuts; they wouldnt cut $20 from 
government spending.
Less than a week later, the 
Democrats in the House defeated 
the Stenholm-Craig Balanced 
Budget Amendment. But that is 
the past. Now there is a compre
hensive tax increase plan on the 
table. Will it work? Only if the 
Democrat-controlled Congress 
can mitigate its blood-thirst for 
more spending. According to Rick 
Santorum, local candidate for 
Congress, so far this century there 
has not been a single tax increase 
that was not followed by an in
crease in spending.

car accident in last weeks Tar
tan [Car hits student, 10/1]. 
The article quoted a police ser
geant as saying that Momin 
was trying to beat the light.
I was attempting to cross the 
street (comer of Forbes and 
Morewood); there were people 
in front of me and people be
hind me. While I was in the 
middle of the intersection a car 
came towards me. I kept as
suming that the driver would 
slow down, since there were so 
many people in the intersec
tion. So, in an effort to avoid 
being hit I tried to cut in front. 
I still got hit.
The agent from Liberty In
surance said that the driver who 
hit me himself wasnt sure of 
whathappened. Therefore, I can 
say with certainty that beating 
the light was a gross inaccu
racy. The case still has not been 
resolved. But the fact remains: 
a pedestrian was hit by a car. 
Since the pedestrian has the 
right of way, I feel that the ar
ticle did not do me justice and 
made me look like a drunk dare
devil advertive-seeking miscre
ant. The walk had changed 
into a dont walk while I was 
in the intersection.
I certainly hope that this let

Letter to 
the Editor
Editor:
We are sick 
and tired of the 
slew of racist 
and sexist re
marks that are 
rampant on this campus. Not one 
day goes by without us hearing 
some demeaning, belittling re
mark about the color of our skin 
or our sexual orientation. In fact, 
comments with deep, negative 
connotations against our sex are 
encouraged by many groups on 
campus. Many of your readers 
will undoubtedly understand our 
predicament. They, too, are fed 
up with being called white, het
erosexual males. By now, many 
of the diverse members of our 
community will have undoubtedly 
discovered with great insight that 
we are the homophobic, misogynistic, militaristic white males 
who wish to suppress everyone 
who is not of the superior race, 
sex, and sexual orientation. At 
this point, we would ask these 
persons to please take a reality 
break and realize how they have 
blinded themselves with their own 
intolerance.
We ask that these diverse 
people please open their minds as 
to who and what we are. We are 
the white, heterosexual males
who are not the white, hetero
sexual males. In other words, we 
are not who you think we are. 
Yes, we are Caucasian. This 
physical trait does not mean, 
however, that we are racist. Yes, 
we are heterosexuals. This choice 
does not imply, however, that we 
view all gays, lesbians, and bi
sexuals as monsters, queers, or 
otherwise undesirable people who 
should be wiped out. Yes, we are 
men. This biological fact, how
ever, does not implicitly define us 
to be sexist.
What prompted this vehement 
attack on the stereotype of the 
white, heterosexual male? The
fact that the description is a ste
reotype did just that. If people of 
color take offense at the word 
nigger and gays at the word 
faggot, why do they use unfair 
and derogatory words to describe 
those who oppress them? Does 
this make them (people of color, 
gays, etc.) any better? Is it politi
cally correct for such an outright 
hateful term to be used to de
scribe another human being? We 
think not.
We are not saying that racism, 
sexism, homophobia, discrimina
tion, and prejudice in general do 
not exist. Nor are we implying 
that the perpetrators are not
white, heterosexual males. Most 
people would agree that in most 
situations, they are. While we do 
not condone such unfair practices, 
we firmly believe that it is very 
bigoted to label all straight, 
caucasian males as something 
they are not. Please do not hold us 
responsible for the thoughtless, 
inhumane actions of others who 
share our race, our gender, and 
our sexual preference.

10The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  8 October 1990
Lets show some more spirit for the Pirates
I never would have guessed it.
As we enter the second week of 
October, the Pittsburgh Pirates 
are still doing business and the 
United States Government is not.
I could probably say a lot about 
either of these things, but I think 
Ill let the governments lack of 
funds go for now. Im not even 
sure how you go about closing a 
government, anyway. I can just 
see Dan Quayle whitewashing the 
windows of the Capitol building 
and posting a sign saying Lost 
our lease! Everything must go 
immediately!
Ill de al with the government on 
election day. For now, its still 
baseball season in this city, even 
if you would hardly know it.
Pittsburgh is trying to get ex
cited about the Pirates. Signs 
urging Go Bucs have popped up 
in the windows oflocal businesses 
and the Pirates now come before 
high school football on the 11 
oclock news.
But Pittsburgh just does not 
have the feel of a city with a team 
in the League Championship Se
ries.
For one thing, you arent sup
posed to be able to call 
Ticketmaster and order whole 
series ticket strips for the play
offs or World Series.
Jonathan Levy
Last year, Chicago Cubs fans 
brought the citys phone service 
to a standstill in mostly futile 
attempts to buy postseason tick
ets two at a time.
Just last week my brother, who 
goes to school in Cambridge, 
Massachusetts, slept in front of 
Bostons Fenway Park with his 
friends in order to get Red Sox 
playoff and World Series tickets. 
For their efforts, they went home 
with about a half a dozen tickets. 
Its not the first time he has done 
so, either. In 1983, he and I spent 
a night in the parking lot of 
Comiskey Park to get tickets for 
the White Sox playoff games.
Thats just the way things are 
in other cities where baseball is 
more than something to do be
tween Steelers games. As much 
as I enjoy the fact that a total of 15 
minutes on the phone has netted 
my friends and myself 28 
postseason Pirates tickets, things 
just dont seem right.
The excitement just isnt there. 
I know Pittsburgh is smaller than 
a lot of major league cities and the
seating capacity at Three Rivers 
Stadium is larger than at some 
other baseball parks. But that 
does not explain the situation.
Even with a policy of selling 
tickets in strips which cover an 
entire series, no one has yet been 
turned down in an attempt to 
buy Pirates postseason tickets 
this year. Many other teams sell 
postseason tickets in sets of two 
single game tickets per customer 
and still only the most dedicated 
or most fortunate fans are able to 
get them because of the tremen
dous demand.
The Pittsburgh metropolitan 
area may only be as large as a 
third or a quarter the population 
of other cities, but the Pirates are 
selling tickets to a third or a quar
ter as many people as other cities 
do.
There is just not as much inter
est in baseball in Pittsburgh as 
there is in other cities. No one is to 
blame, but it is still sort of a 
waste. If the Pirates lose, there 
will not be as much civic anguish 
as there would be in cities such as 
Cleveland or Detroit or New York. 
But if they win, there will not be 
as much joy.
I am rooting for the Pirates in 
the playoffs, largely because I 
want a chance for them to go to 
World Series games. And I will 
root for them in the World Series 
if they make it. But I cant help 
but feel conflicted. Only one city i 
year gets to have the major leagm 
baseball champions, and the op. 
portunity would probably be 
wasted on Pittsburgh.

Non-Smoking Week should be practiced every week
onEditor:
I would like to 
thank all those 
who observed Letter to 
Non-Smoking Editor
Week, espe
cially those who encouraged 
smokers not to smoke, and those 
who did not smoke. I am sure
everyone at Environmental 
Health & Safety appreciates this 
too, since smoking pollutes the 
environment, is bad for your 
health. I hope that everyone who 
observed Non-Smoking Week will 
continue to observe and promote 
it in the future for the benefit of 
mankind.
We need to slowly try and elimi
nate unnecessary pollution and 
have a greater concern for the 
lives of those around us. Without 
that, it is impossible to continue 
living in harmony. The lethal as
pects of smoking deter us from 
doing so; therefore, I would ap
preciate it if everyone avoided
unnecessary pollution. In the long 
run, it is the people who reduce 
pollution who will be remembered 
as having helped to protect the 
wildlife and plants on earth, which 
are slowing becoming depleted.

Senators are endangering others with dyslexic solutions
Id be relieved if I found out that 
a certain group of Pennsylvania 
legislatorshasbeen sufferingfrom 
a bit of dyslexia lately.
It seems that they have  at 
least for the time being  chosen 
to see what I thought was a simple 
and sensible constitutional prin
ciple opposite the way it was in
tended.
The principle  innocent until 
proven guilty  is one that has 
become a trademark of judicial 
systems in the free world.
A bill championed by Mothers 
Against Drunk Driving and now 
up for the approval of the State 
Senate would strike that demo
cratic principle a hefty blow if it 
were to become law.
The proposed addition to the 
motor vehicle code would em
power law enforcement officials 
and the Department of Transpor
tation to suspend the licenses of 
drivers whom they determined
Michael Ewedosh
had been driving under the influ
ence.
The intention of the Senators 
who framed the law was to reduce 
the number of repeat offenses 
committed by drunken drivers 
who havent yet had their days in 
court for their first offenses.
The problem that the Senators 
identified is certainly valid: even 
if one ignores the fact that a 
drunken driver has made the 
decision to disregard the value of 
human life, maimings and killings 
that could have been prevented 
by a more efficient criminal justice 
system are unacceptable.
Once the arresting officer or the 
department of transportation de
termines that the allegedly
drunken driver was indeed under 
the influence, they would notify 
the driver that his or her license 
will be suspended in 15 days. The 
only way that the accused can 
remain only accused  and not 
guilty  is by filing a protest 
within eight days. If no protest is 
filed, the driver becomes guilty 
and loses his or her license  no 
trial, no judge, no jury.
If  as the senators seem to be 
implyingthe problem lies with 
the delay between apprehension 
of alleged offenders and their date 
in court, then the senators should 
do something to make the crimi
nal justice system more efficient.
As can be expected, though, the 
senators seem to have chosen the 
path that treats a symptom and 
not the disease. Empowering the 
executive branch of government 
to do a job thats now relegated to 
the judicial branch because law
makers dont like the way its be
ing done is a band-aid cure that 
may do more damage than good.
Their solution should have died 
of neglect in the State Senates 
Judiciary committee.
While issues concerning sepa
ration of powers may not apply 
here, the bill certainly strips the 
accused of his or her rights to due 
process and of remaining inno
cent until proven guilty.
The precedent this law would 
set scares me. The phrase inno
cent until proven guilty would 
become to sound more and more 
like guilty unless proven inno
cent. Thats a far cry from what 
the framers of the U.S. Constitu
tion  and the founders of this 
nation  had in mind some 200 
years ago.
Lets just hope its a case of 
dyslexia.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  8 October 199011
Energy sources used today are not the best choices for the future
Imagine a world supplied with limit
less energy. All the electricity is supplied 
by a renewable energy source. It causes 
no pollution, does not require extensive 
.mining of the earth, and leaves behind 
, no toxic waste. Imagine power that could 
,be generated with all these benefits for 
-only pennies per watt of output.
Youll have to keep imagining because 
there really isnt any energy source 
readily available now that is renewable, 
pollution-free, and cheap. But there are 
,some good choices. Unfortunately, 
.though, the traditional sources of power 
,-for this era  coal, oil, natural gas, and
- nuclear powerare not the best choices 
for the future.
Oil. Also known as petroleum, oil is a 
nonrenewable fuel formed by the de
composition of dinosaurs and other an
cient beasts millions of years ago and
compression by layers and layers of earth.
Oil is burned to produce electricity, re
fined to gasoline to be used in cars, or 
converted into other substances includ
ing kerosene, heating oil, motor oil, and 
the resins that make up plastic.
However, oil almost always has impu
rities dissolved into it, and when burned, 
these impurities are vaporized and escape 
in the form of pollution. Gasoline used in 
automobile engines does not bum com
pletely and releases carbon monoxide 
into the atmosphere. Also, the worlds oil 
supplies are dwindling rapidly. The esti
mates range from seven to 100 years 
worth of oil left on the earth; clearly, 
with our ever-increasing demand for oil 
and our decreasing supply, we dont have 
much time until the oil runs out.
Coal. Coal is anon-renewable resource 
that is burned to generate electricity.
Jeffrey Woodford
Coal is not as scarce as oil  400 years 
worth is a good estimate  but it does 
cause pollution like oil. The burning of 
coal releases nitrogen oxides and sulfur 
oxides into the atmosphere, two main 
components of acid rain. Also, mining 
corporations construct large strip mines 
to mine coal, disturbing and often ruin
ing entire ecosystems.
Natural Gas. Natural gas is actually 
methane, the simplest hydrocarbon. It is 
usually found with deposits of oil and 
bums more cleanly than coal or oil. How
ever, the supply of natural gas is se
verely limited; it is estimated that there 
is much less natural gas than oil. Sup
plies may run out before the year 2050.
Nuclear Fission. When uranium atoms 
collide with neutrons, tremendous 
amounts of energy are released. This 
energy creates what is today termed 
nuclear power. However, when the ura
nium atom is split, waste products are 
formed. These waste products are much 
more unstable than uranium (such as 
unstable iodine) and must be put some
where until the radioactivity calms down. 
This may take years, as is the case with 
unstable iodine, or millenia, as is the 
case with plutonium. Also, radioactive 
substances like uranium and plutonium 
are carcinogenic and can be fatal; if a 
thousandth of a gram of plutonium, no 
bigger than a speck of dust, is inhaled, it 
can kill.
There must be some alternative en
ergy sources that we can use to relieve
our increasingly heavy dependence on 
the quickly waning supplies of fossil fu
els. As demonstartedby the Persian Gulf 
Crisis of today, because the United States 
is so dependent on oil, we are willing to 
risk American lives to ensure our supply 
of oil. Do we have any alternatives, 
though?
Yes  wind power, solar power, geo
thermal energy, and nuclear fusion, to 
name a few. But these energy sources; 
seem merely theoretical experiments in 
the laboratory; only concepts that cannot 
be practically implemented on a large 
scale with todays technology.
But theyre not as theoretical as one 
may think. Tune in next week to find out 
why.

We find that we must also take 
issue with the quotes Ms. 
Struminger used in her article, 
specifically: It was not a rape in 
a traditional sense  many de
grading things occurred to the 
victim said LaPaglia. The im
plication here is that traditional 
style rapes are not degrading. 
Allow us to emphasize for those 
who may still be in doubt: all rape 
is degrading.
The tone of the entire article 
was that the victimized student 
deserved the treatment she re
ceived. It is true that she un
thinkingly placed herself in quite 
a dangerous position. But hadnt 
she been victimized enough? 
Surely The Tartan should not add 
to her misery.
The Tartan has a responsibility 
to the Carnegie Mellon campus 
community to make the fullest 
report possible. A brutal rape 
which took place outside a campus 
building is of vital interest to all 
members of the student body. We
strongly feel that it is certainly 
more important to more readers 
of The Tartan than CMU founds 
Japan office, an article which 
received much more in-depth re
porting, more space, and virtually 
abetter position on the front page. 
Many Carnegie Mellon students, 
in fact, did not see the Men As
sault Pitt Student article at all 
because of its size and placement 
on the page.
The Tartan failed to discharge 
its duties to the Carnegie Mellon 
community in a responsible man
ner. The September 24 article is a 
disgrace to a publication which 
prides itself on its professional
ism. Vital information was not 
submitted, information which 
could lead to an arrest for a repre
hensible crime.
It is our sincerest hope that The 
Tartan will not allow this sort of 
error to occur ever again.

berth by knocking off Bethany 
College, 10. Bethany, a former 
Presidents Athletic Conference 
rival, came into the game ranked 
second nationally among Division 
III schools.
This was definitely the biggest 
win of the season for us, said
injured sophomore sweeper John 
Stivoric.
The Tartans won the game de
spite being outgunned by the 
Bisons for most of the afternoon. 
In fact, CMU was unable to put a 
shot on goal in the second half of 
the contest. Bethany held the 
Tartans in check despite drawing 
numerous penalties, including 
three yellow cards.
The only Tartan goal ofthe game 
came on a defensive lapse by 
Bethany goal keeper Omar Jobe.
Divsion
Thirty minutes into the game, 
junior sweeper Alan Horn lofted a 
high ball into the goal area; Jobe 
went up for the easy catch but 
misjudged it. The ball tipped off 
his fingertips and dropped into 
the Bisons net for a 1-0 CMU 
advantage.
With less than five minutes left 
in the half, Bethany received a 
golden opportunity to even the 
score, but came up empty. A bad 
rebound caught freshman goal 
keeper Dave Shapiro way out of
position, giving Bethany forward 
John Ault an open net to shoot at. 
However, Aults easy finishing 
shot went directly up into the 
crossbar and bounced down out
side the CMU goal.
We expected a lot of pressure, 
especially when we got up 10, 
said head coach Nick Gaudioso. 
We knew they had a forward 
style of play; we just didnt know 
when theyd start attacking.
The Bisons came out flying in 
the second half, and took com
plete control of the game. How
ever, they came up empty on the 
scoreboard, due mostly to superb 
goal keeping by Dave Shapiro.
Opportunity after opportunity 
was turned away by Shapiro, and 
the Bisons were unable to cash in 
on the few mistakes he did make. 
Several close shots went wide or 
high of the net, including a blast 
from within 10 yards of the 
Carnegie Mellon net.

After all, its 
only a game
Over the summer, I was 
watching a Little League 
practice where the coach openly 
berated one of his players 
because the kid felt tired and 
didnt want to practice anymore. 
This coach was yelling at the 
top of his lungs at a boy who 
:quldnt have been more than 
eleven years old.
Quick. Somebody tell me 
whats wrong with this picture.
It seems that the good old 
competitive instinct has gone 
way overboard in athletics, 
especially in recent years. In 
most circles, the concepts of 
sportsmanship and fair play 
hve been tossed aside in favor 
of an incredibly convoluted win 
at all costs attitude.
Last Sundays soccer game 
against Brandeis University 
serves as a perfect example.
After watching his team lose 1- 
the Brandeis coach kicked 
oyer a garbage can and pro
ceeded to swear at .several CMU 
students who commented on his 
behavior from the windows of 
the new dorm. I hear he made 
ah open invitation for anyone to 
come down and fight him. What 
ipinhead.
'Unfortunately, the coaches 
and the players arent half as 
as the fans. In Saturdays 
$me against Bethany, Bison 
rioters crossed the line between 
jood-natured ribbing and 
vulgar abuse before the opening 
whistle was ever blown. Theres 
a definite difference between

lim down, make sure he stays 
lown, after a Bison foul. And 
vlhoever tried to break the

lis actions.
It wasnt half as bad as when 
^thanys local bar offered ten 
:^nt drafts before a basketball 
[me against Carnegie Mellon, 
mt it did ruin my enjoyment of 
vhat was otherwise the best 
jfame of the Tartans season.
1 can almost understand 
i^havior like this at higher 
eyels of competition. Theres a 
of money involved at the pro 
ind major college level, so the 
>ressure is understandably 
ugh. People get tense and do 
nings they probably shouldnt. 
3halk it up to heat of the 
foment.
But this is Division III, where

ompeting for a pro job, and 
even a Division III national

I Asides, the whole point of 
j Sports is that theyre supposed 
to be fun for the participants

So lets start acting a bit more

The Carnegie Mellon Tartans blanked the 
Rochester Yellowjackets 31-0 Saturday be
fore a Homecoming crowd of 3,124 at Gesling 
Stadium. It was the fifth meeting between the 
University Athletic Association rivals, but the 
first time the Tartans have come out on top.
1990 pre-season polls picked the Tartans to 
win the UAA, and picked Rochester to finish 
second. Coming into Saturdays game, CMU 
sat atop the UAA with a perfect 20 record, 4 
0 overall. Rochester was 2-1,3-1 overall. The 
winner of this matchup was assured at least a 
tie for first place in the UAA.
We knew it would be a tough game, said 
head coach Rich Lackner. We couldnt afford 
to think about division championships. We 
had to focus on this team and concentrate on 
winning this game. We knew how important it 
wasfor the UAA standings, but we didnt dwell 
on it.
This was a game of defensive domination for 
the Tartans, who completely shut down the 
potent Rochester running attack. The 
Yellowjackets, averaging 282.5 yards rushing 
per game, managed just 47 net yards.
Halfback Carmen Malitino, who was aver
aging more than 100 yards per game prior to 
Saturday, gained 72 yards to provide most of 
Rochesters offense. But the Yellowjackets 
other backs rushed for a combined minus 25 
yards. Yellowjacket quarterback EricZumdieck 
completed only one pass for six yards, was 
sacked four times and threw two interceptions.
We thought, coming in, that it was going to 
be a very physical game, said nose tackle Jim

Rose, who recorded two-and-a-half sacks. It 
was physical, but only when their offensive 
line double-teamed us. When it wasnt a double
team, they couldnt handle our lines speed. 
We were too fast for them.
Offensively, the Tartans had one of their 
most complete games, gaining 376 yards on 
the ground and 106 through the air. Quarter
back Billy Snyder was nine-of-16 for 87 yards 
and backup Sam Mangano was one-of-one for 
19 yards. On the other end, receiver Don 
DeCaro led the team with four receptions for 
57 yards.

Pirates, Reds come to town with even series

The Pittsburgh Pirates took 
advantage of a misjudged ball by 
Eric Davis in Game One of the 
National League Championship 
Series to win and take away 
Cincinnatis home field advan

the sun and an early start to sal

Pittsburgh and Cincinnati split

The Pirates and Reds combined play along with the Oakland As.
This is the fifth renewal of the 
most frequently played post-season matchup. Cincinnati won the

games and then proceeded to beat 
the Baltimore Orioles in seven 
games to win the World Series.
Pittsburgh skipper Jim Leyland

poise of a veteran, having pitched 
in the playoffs before, unlike any

only one hit for the next five in

the inning by walking Mike

Rugby settles for tie
By TOM ANFUSO
Special to The Tartan
Carnegie Mellon rugby failed to maintain a 
substantial second-half lead over Altoona Col
lege Saturday at Dan Marino field, allowing 
Altoona to come from behind and tie the game 
at 2222 in final minutes.
CMUs previous two games had been domi
nated by the defensive play of its scrummies. 
Saturday, however, the backfield rose to the 
occasion and maintained a strong attack 
throughout most the game. The game pace 
was fast, with both teams making continuous 
desperation kicks out of defensive territory.
In the first half, Carnegie Mellons scrum 
had some difficulty in both driving the larger 
Altoona squad off the ball and winning key 
line-outs. However, the backfield managed to 
win the ball with strong tackling.
Midway through the half, Iron Mike Keller, 
one of only two freshmen on the A-side, brushed
his way through Altoona defenders to score 
a try. Gerry Stocker missed a nearly im
possible points-after kick, and the score 
remained 40. Near the end of the half, 
hooker Jim Harris swiped the ball on a 
line-out. He then scrum-hacked the ball 
through befuddledAltonna defenders, and 
allowed his raging scrum to drive him over 
the tiy-line for a score. Stocker split the 
uprights on the points-after kick to up the 
score to 100.
A complacent CMU squad resorted to 
sloppy tackling and allowed an Altoona 
scrummied to bash his way into the tryzone just before the half ended. Altoona 
missed an easy points-after kick, and the 
halftime score was 10-4, CMUs lead.
Early in the second half, lightning-fast 
CMU back Neil Talsania was practically 
demolished when hit by an Altoona player 
nearly twice his size. In a memorable

Barnyak rushes into record books in Tartans winning effort
FOOTBALL, from page 13
Senior halfback Scott Barnyak 
led a balanced Tartan rushing 
attack with 163 yards and two 
touchdowns. Fullbacks Fran 
Bellante, Greg Marmol and Grif
fin Pero combined for 122 yards. 
Halfback Drew Pizzuro picked up 
32 yards on the ground. Mangano 
and Snyder had 65 yards rushing 
between them.
. Our strong point is running, 
said Barnyak. There hasnt been 
a team this season thats been 
completely able to shut down our 
running game. Rochester came in 
today and they wanted to play a 
real physical game and try to stop 
us and I think we turned that 
around. We played the kind of 
game that they themselves 
wanted to play and ended up 
having a big game.
Barnyak entered the game
needing just seven yards and five 
points to become CMUs all-time 
leading rusher and scorer. On the 
first play from scrimmage, he 
carried the ball for eight yards to 
break Bob Gasiors record 1,865. 
Two touchdowns brought his ca
reer total to 37, and gave him 234 
career points, breaking Gasiors 
record 224.
It feels really good to break the 
records, said Barnyak. But Im 
glad we won because even though 
I got the record, if we hadnt won, 
it would have soured my indi
vidual achievements. I just want 
to do whatever I can to help the 
team win. Winnings the most 
important thing and individual 
goals are secondary.
The Tartans scored first. Se
nior Joe Schwerha, who kicked 
the winning field goal last week
end against Adrian, booted a 31-

EFbds adii kAsFSAg qAaER A RHEc dq VdafERiEs PEqEFPEsR bF fbR qAaE9
yard field goal with just under 10 
minutes to play in the first quar
ter. Schwerhas field goal capped 
off an 11-play, 56-yard drive and 
put the Tartans up 30. The drive 
was keyed by a 19-yard pass from 
Snyder to Marmol on fourth and 
three that gave the Tartans first 
and ten at the Rochester 18 
yardline.
For the rest of the first half, 
neither team was able to scor.e. 
The Tartan offense had several 
scoring opportunities inside the 
Rochester 20, but failed to convert 
excellent field position into points. 
Key penalties against the Tartans 
and failed third-down conversions 
kept the Tartans out of the end 
zone and kept the game close for 
the Yellowjackets.
We should have scored another
14 or 21 points in the first half, 
whichis very disappointing, said 
Snyder.
The first half ended with the 
Tartans clinging to a 3-0 lead, 
but the game was not as close as 
the score. The Tartans held the 
ball for more than twenty-one 
minutes and racked up 249 firsthalf yards. The Yellowjackets 
offense had just 22 yards of total 
offense in five possessions.
On the Tartans first possession 
of the second half, they finally put 
the ball in the end zone. Snyder 
engineered a 10-play, 41-yard 
drive, keyed by a 12-yard pass to 
receiver Don DeCaro on thirdand-five. The completion gave the 
Tartans first-and-10 at the Roch
ester 13 yardline. Five plays later, 
after a key fourth-down conver
sion, Barnyak took the ball in 
from one yard out. Schwerhas 
extra point was blocked, but the 
Tartans led 9-0 with 8:20 re
maining in the third quarter.
After their first touchdown, it 
didnt take the Tartans long to 
strike again. On their next pos
session, Barnyak took the ball in

the game came when Shapiro was caught out of 
position. A loose rebound rolled right to a Bethany 
forward who fired on the goal. The ball almost 
reached the Tartan net, but was deflected at the 
last minute by Alan Horn, who was almost in the 
goal when he made the play.
The final minutes featured excruciating pressure 
by Bethanys offense that included three corner 
lucks, but Shapiro took control of the game and 
cleaned up the goal area. The Tartans were able to 
lull the clock and walk away with the victory.
Dave played a great game, said Gaudioso. He 
did an especially good job on Bethanys high crosses. 
He can get up and catch the ball as well as any goal 
keeper around.
There was just so much going through my mind 
[in the final minutes], said Shapiro. I just kept 
thinking that I had to hold them to get us a victory.

again, this time from six yards 
out. But the Tartans received a 
scare when Snyder went down 
after an incompletion on the 
fourth play from scrimmage. He 
went to the sidelines with a hy
perextended knee, and Mangano 
stepped in to lead the Tartan of
fense.
Although Snyders pass was 
incomplete, a defensive pass in
terference call against the 
Yellowjackets gave the Tartans 
first and 10 at the Rochester 34. 
After a fumble, which the Tar
tans recovered, Barnyak ran for 
10 yards and Mangano ran for 22 
yards to give the Tartans first 
and goal at the six. Bamyaks 
touchdown capped off the sevenplay, 69-yard drive and gave the 
Tartans a 15-0 lead. A two-point 
conversion made the score 17-0 
with 52 seconds left in the third 
quarter.
But the Tartans werent 
through. After the defense 
stopped Rochester and forced 
them to punt, CMU took over on 
their own 24 yardline with 14:19 
left to play. Twelve straight rush
ing plays, including a big gain of
15 yards by Marmol, brought the 
Tartans to the Rochester 23. Then, 
on third-and-nine, Mangano 
threw the ball for the first time, 
and hit DeCaro for 19 yards and a 
first down at the Rochester four.
Manganos first attempt at the 
end zone came up inches short. 
But on third-and-goal inside the 
one, he took the ball in for the 
third Tartan touchdown of the 
afternoon. Schwerha nailed the 
extra point, and the Tartans led 
24^-0 with just under seven min
utes remaining in the game.
Rochesters offensive woes con
tinued. On the first play from 
scrimmage after Manganos 
touchdown, Zumdieck threw the 
ball right into the arms of Tartan 
defensive back Brian Lippert and

the Tartans took over at their 
own 36. Eleven plays and 64 yards 
later, the Tartans scored again. 
This time, Pero took the ball in 
from fifteen yards out and backup 
kicker Fred Harding booted the 
extra point to give the Tartans a 
convincing 31-0 win.
The Tartans are now 5-0 over
all, 3-0 in UAA play. They have 
three home games in a row before 
playing their last two games on 
the road. This Saturday at 1:30 
pm, the Tartans host the Grove
City College Wolverines in a non
conference match-up.
Weve got three home games in 
a row and were in a nice situation 
at 5-0, said Mangano. We just 
cant take anyone lightly. Wevp 
got to take one game at a time apd 
get the things done that we need 
to accomplish.
Weve just got to keep our heads 
up and play game by game, said 
Barnyak. I think if we play every 
game like we played today, there 
isnt a team that can stop us.
There was just so much 
going through my mind.... I

Coach Gary Meckley was ex

Not only did the Tartans win the

the Small College trophy as well.
Despite the unseasonal heat, 
the Tartan runners fared well 
against the competition. They 
would have run earlier in the day, 
but the Central Catholic Cross

held up due to an accident.
No such accident occurred in

Meckley feels that this is a good 
indicator of what the team can do 
at the UAA meet at Brandeis

thinks the team can compete with 
the top teams in the UAA. But he 
also believes CMU can sneak into

times, teed up a pitch to Sid 
Bream. Bream gladly accecpted 
the offer and launched it to deep 
right field to tie the game at 
three.
The Pirates scored their final 
run in the seventh when Andy 
Van Slykes hit to left was 
misplayed by Eric Davis and 
bounced over the wall for a 
ground rule double, scoring Gary 
Redus, who just stole second.
Game Two featured a lineup 
favorable to Pittsburgh. With 22- 
game winner Doug Drabek 
starting against Tom Browning, 
who is 8-3 at home, thoughts of
a Pittsburgh sweep started to 
surface.
Cincinnati opened up the night 
just like they did in Game One, 
scoring again in the first, but this 
time only one run on two hits, two 
walks and two stolen bases. The 
Pirates had the leadoff man on 
base on each of the first three 
innings, but were unable to capi
talize.
The Pirates scored their lone 
run on a leadoff home run in the 
fifth inning by Jose Lind, not 
known at all for his power. In the 
bottom half of the inning, The 
Reds took advantage of a 
misplayed ball to left, much as 
the Pirates did the day before, to 
score their second and final run of
the game.
Pittsburgh tried to come 
back, but only reached base two 
times the rest of the game, both 
in the sixth, but fell short of 
scoring when Van Slyke was

As humiliate Sox in Game One
By KATIE CULBERTSON
Tartan Sports Editor
From the outset ofthe season, 
the baseball community pitied 
the American League East team 
that would most likely face the 
Oakland As in this months 
league playoffs.
Saturday night, it was diffi
cult not to pity the Boston Red 
Sox, as they threw away Game 
One ofthe series to the As 9-1.
Last night, the As moved into 
a 2-0 lead in the series with a
4-1 win.
For the first seven innings of 
Game One, Boston held its own 
against the As, actually scor
ing first, off a fourth-inning 
Wade Boggs homerun.
But when Boston manager 
Joe Morgan yanked Red Sox 
ace Roger Clemens from the 
mound after six innings, the 
Sox fell apart and the As took 
charge. The deeper Boston 
dipped into its bullpen, the 
deeper it sank into a mire of 
errors and sloppy plays.
Saturday night, it was difficult not 
to pity the Boston Red Sox, as they 
threw away Game One of the series.
Going into the ninth inning, 
Oakland led 3-1. But they ran 
away with the game in the ninth, 
scoring seven runs before the Red 
Sox crippled defense mercifully 
made the third out. Three quick 
outs in the bottom of the ninth 
sealed the victory for Oakland.
Boston scored first last night in 
Game Two, in the third inning, 
followed by an Oakland run inthe 
fourth. With the bases loaded in 
the seventh, the As scored again.
Several hits in the eighth gave 
the Sox new life, but As pitcher 
Dennis Eckersley quickly quieted 
the Boston comeback. Oakland 
manager Tony LaRussa ushered 
Eckersley onto the mound late in 
the eighth.
Also in the eighth, a potential 
Oakland double play was 
squelched when second baseman
Walt Weiss was injured trip
ping over the Boston 
baserunner. Weiss was unable 
to hang onto the ball to make 
the out at first.
In the ninth inning, the As 
put any Sox hopes to rest when 
they scored two more runs, 
making the final score 41.
Boston has its work cut out 
for it now. The loss last night 
made the series outlook far 
bleaker for the Sox. With two 
losses at home, they are now 
facing three games in Oak
land, ifteh As do not sweep the 
playoffs in four straight.
If this was the easiest part of 
the series for Boston, it has a 
long week ahead, and if this 
was toughest part of the series 
for the As, then they have an 
easy ride ahead of them now.

it wasnt the blowout I expected.
Seattle did the blowing out, hu

What happened after the game,

SCENARIO #1
Keith has been looking forward to shooting a few 
hoops all day. He asks his roommate Doug to come out and shoot with him, but Doug says he's got to study for a test. Keith keeps pestering him and pulling Doug away from his book and finally 
succeeds in dragging Doug off his chair. Doug's getting pretty mad because he really needs to study and Keith continues to ignore him, and actually pulls him across the floor and out the 
door.
SCENARIO #2, A FEW MONTHS LATER
Keith invites Kristen to a party he is hosting on Friday night. She likes him and would like to get 
to know him better; he thinks she's bright and pretty attractive too. The party is a blast. Both Keith and Kristen are drinking because the beer is 
flowing, and they dance together for a bunch of songs. Keith had promised Kristen the notes from a class she missed, so they go up to his room to get them. In his room, they sit close 
together, talk for awhile, and soon the beer, the moment and hormones kick in, and their lips become locked for an extended period of time. 
Things progress. Kristen starts unbuttoning 
Keith's shirt and 501's, but he's not sure he wants things to progress to sex, so he kind of 
pulls away, and suggests going back to the party. Kristen nods no and keeps pushing him back onto 
the couch. She cajoles, pushes, persuades and 
kind of forces him to continue.

This weekend the womens vol
leyball team participated in the 
UAA Round Robin at the Univer
sity of Rochester and was incon
sistent in playing according to 
Head Coach Charlotte Fisher.
The Tartans began well with a 
victory against Emory on Friday 
morning in four games, 715,15 
9,15-9,15-7. Later in the after
noon Rochester humbled the 
Tartans slightly by sweeping the 
match against them 6-15, 5-15, 
1-15.
Washington University, the
number one team in the Univer
sity Athletic Association, had a 
difficult contest against CMU on 
Saturday morning but overcame 
the Tartans in three games 3-15,
5-15, 12-15. The Tartans then 
had a two-hour match against 
Brandeis and won in five games 
7-15,16-14,15-8, 9-15,15-13.
In typical CMU style the Tar
tans came back from 0-14 by 
winningl6 straight points to take 
game two and eventually the rest 
of the match. Immediately after 
defeating Brandeis, the Tartans 
had to play University of Chicago 
which beat the Tartans 2-15, 7 
15,10-15.
^LuJ 
Fisher described the teams 
playing as off and on...the usual 
Carnegie Mellon [womens vol

very strong defensively which, 
earned them compliments from 
other teams and Fisher.
As forthe teams play as a wholeFisher commented that We imi, 
prove upon each game [nra 
match]....Were still making im
provements through the match.- 
Fisher pointed to sophomore 
Heather Thompsons defense, se-, 
nior Nicole Hanaks front line 
play, and freshman Ann Fengs 
serving as strong points of the 
weekend.

Fairmont defeats tennis 6-3
By KATIE CULBERTSON
Tartan Sports Editor
Saturday, the womens tennis 
team lost at home to Fairmont 
State College, 3-6.
Although the team was not able 
to pull out the win, several indi
vidual successes highlighted the 
match for the Tartans.
CMUs number three singles 
Whitney Weber continues to be 
undefeated this season, while 
number six singles Silvina Candia 
has only lost one match. Weber 
won 6-0, 6-2 against Fairmonts 
Ann Rister, while Candia posted 
the same score against Antoinette 
Sorenti. Also, the pair is 
undefeated as the number two 
ddilbles team. Saturday, they won 
6^3,61.
In Saturdays match, these 
three victories were the only ones 
CMU could pull out. Mary Beth 
Ashbaugh hung in at number one 
singles for three sets, but 
Fairmonts Kriss Haught eventu
ally won 63, 2-6, 6-1. Number 
two Alice Garber lost in straight 
sets 6-2,6-2, number four Laura 
Ahr, lost 62, 60, and number

Rugby ties with Altoona College
RUGBY, from page 13
display of guts, Talsania imme
diately recovered the ball and 
outraced Altoona defenders to 
score. Stocker made the pointsafter kick barefoot to set the score 
at 164. With 20 minutes left, 
CMU scrummie Chris Devlin 
surged over the try-line in an 
Oskie play to up the score another 
four points. Sure-footed Stocker 
again made the points-after kick.
With a 22-4 lead, CMU com
pletely lost its composure in the 
last 15 minutes. Sloppy tackling 
and uncoordinated plays allowed
Altoona to maintain the ball deep 
in CMU territory. An Altoona 
scrummie drove the ball through 
CMUs defense to score. The 
points-after kick was good, and 
the score was 22-10. CMU man
aged to barely hold off a surging 
Altoona attack.
With only five minutes remain
ing, Altoona redoubled its efforts 
and managed to score two more 
times, making the first pointsafter kick and missing the second. 
When the final whistle blew, a 
dismayed CMU squad left the 
field. The final score: 22-22.
Carnegie Mellon flanker 
Charlie Clem Jarkowski re
marked after the game: Those 
last five minutes were undoubt
edly the worst five minutes this 
team has ever played. We com
pletely dominated these guys for 
seventy-five minutes, only to slack 
off and blow it at the very end. We 
learned our lesson, though. It 
wont happen again.
CMU rugby is 1-1-1 so far in 
the fall season. In two weeks, the 
ruggers head to Shippensburg 
where they will take on a nation
allyranked team.

The Carnegie Mellon lacrosse 
team played a physical game 
versus Slippery Rock Saturday 
night in Gesling Stadium.
Knowing the nature of Slippery 
Rocks team, CMU tried not to get 
involved in any extra activities on 
the field except lacrosse.
Nevertheless, as the game pro
gressed, there were many shoving 
and pushing incidents among 
players. The game had several 
penalties called on both sides, but 
at the end, CMU keept its cool, 
pulling out a 12-9 victory.
Senior Rob Kendall led the 
scoring with five goals and two
assists; seven different players 
notched the rest of the Carnegie 
Mellon goals.
It was a total team effort as 
Slippery Rock kept coming back, 
even into the fourth and last 
quarter. The score was tied at 
eight into the middle of third 
quarter. CMU then started to 
outplay the opponent, running 
their 2-2 play to a success. It 
gave them three crucial goals 
within the next three minutes.
SRU also helped the cause by 
committing an unnecessary 
roughness foul, playing mandown for those three minutes.
In addition, senior Peter 
Vonderlieth had numerous saves 
on one on one situations.
Throughout this game CMU 
showed it can hold its own game 
against a tough physical oppo
nent.
Yesterday, CMU played PLC 
but lost 12-6. CMU held the PLC 
and was only down 65 at the 
close of the first half, but faded in 
the second because they were 
tired from the SRU game the 
night before.
We just lost steam, said 
sophomore Russell Elkin.
The lacrosse club will be play
ing a major tournament at home 
in Gesling Stadium this weekend. 
Some of the teams invited are 
Washington and Jefferson and 
PLC. The CMU team now boasts 
a 3-1 record.

In 1940, World War II was raging in 
Europe, Carnegie Mellons tuition was 
$360 a year, and Norma Shea graduated 
from the College of Fine Arts with a drama 
degree.
Through the eyes of Mrs. Shea 
Langworthy, who returned to campus this 
weekend for her fiftieth reunion, Carnegie 
Mellon has indeed changed since gradua
tion, from the institution of graduate 
classes to the disappearance of Margaret 
Morrison Carnegie College for women. 
However, through all the upheaval many 
things have remained the same.
Langworthys career in entertainment 
started here in Pittsburgh during her 
college career. Besides classes, she ap
peared in many Pittsburgh Playhouse 
productions for which she received credit

in school.
In fact, during her sophomore year, she 
was offered a dancing job by friend and 
coworker Gene Kelly. Although she de
clined the offer, she and Kelly remain 
friends to this day.
After graduation, she worked in radio, 
appearing on such shows as The Phillip 
Morris Hour. She continued working in 
theater and on radio until her marriage to 
Yale graduate David Langworthy. They 
moved to Philadelphia where Mrs. 
Langworthy continued her career and 
raised four children, two of whom attended 
CMU. After staying in Philly for 35 years, 
the Langworthys built a house 12 years 
ago in New York City where they now 
produce shows.
Langworthy, who has served as the only 
female president of Carnegie Mellons na
tional alumni association, reflected on her 
experiences as a Carnegie Mellon student 
and alumna. Times certainly have 
changed. The girls came here, stayed in 
dorms, she said. They had to sign in, and 
they had to sign out, and if they werent 
back by a certain time, they were pun
ished.... I remember ... they [some guys] 
snuck me into the boys dorm [McGill Hall], 
and I stayed there for about fifteen min
utes, crouched inside. Now this was a BIG 
DEAL. My claim to fame was that I had 
been in the boys dorm.
Now today we walked through the new 
building, and the young man said that this 
is a co-ed building.... The girls have a suite 
and the boys have a suite but I got to 
laughing so hard because there is the new 
building where its coed, and heres the old 
building where sneaking me in for fifteen 
minutes was something so shocking.
Other facets of university living have 
changed as well. The graduate program 
which has become such a strong part of 
CMTTs reputation did not even exist in 
1940. The educational focus of the uni
versity was completely on the under
graduate level. I would call CMU a country 
day school compared to a big public school, 
Langworthy said. We had classes of 18, 
classes of 20.
The school also drew the majority of its 
students from the immediate western 
Pennsylvania area. The one major excep
tion was the drama school, which had 
already gained an excellent reputation for 
turning out actors and actresses which 
were among the best in the business. It 
was a regional school, said Langworthy, 
but the one place that reached out to New 
York, California, the Midwest, Canada, 
was the drama school and thats because it 
had national recognition,
The excellent reputation of the Drama 
Department was and still is one of the 
universitys biggest draws. The Drama 
Department here in Pittsburgh just had a 
faculty that was fantastic. They had stu
dents who were just extremely talented 
and they left the school, they went to New 
York, and they became immediate suc
cesses, Langworthy said. It just put the 
school on the map, and nobody could fig
ure out how this phenomenon could hap
pen in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, when 
here was NYU in New York and the 
American Academy ... [Carnegie Mellon] 
was THE place to come if you wanted to be 
in theatre.
When Langworthy attended CMU, it 
was comprised of three parts: Carnegie 
Tech was mostly men, Margaret Morrison 
Carnegie College was entirely women, and 
the College of Fine Arts was coeduca
tional. [CFA] was supposed to be way out, 
but the most way out thing anyone did ... 
was to have a beer and smoke a cigarette.
From her work on the alumni board, 
Langworthy has noticed a major disad
vantage involved in the discontinuation of 
the Margaret Morrison Carnegie College, 
which taught such things as secretarial 
skills, nursing, and dietition: As far as 
soliciting donations from alumni, its dif
ficult to do if the alumnas school no longer 
exists, she said.
With all the change at CMU, though, 
many things have remained the same. 
Spring Carnival and Buggy are as big now 
as they were then. And, according to 
Langworthy, the university is still in dire 
need of a performing arts center: It was 
funny to me when President Mehrabian... 
said that there would be an arts center, 
that he was dedicated to that, she said. I 
have heard the last four presidents dedi
cate themselves toanartscenter....Thisis

PITTSBURGH...
Pittsburgh will soon dispose of the gridlock
By DAN HOLLAND
Tartan Staffwriter
No one likes traffic. The jams, pollu
tion, horn blowing, and violent exchange 
of words only makes commuting a night
mare. Especially in Pittsburgh, the con
gested arteries in and around the city 
are complicated by an old infrastructure 
and hilly topography. This is a status 
expected to worsen considerably by 2005.
However, there is a solution in a 
relatively new and modern technological 
breakthrough: Magnetic Levitation
Transportation, or maglev.
In Europe and Japan, maglev systems 
have revolutionized transportation 
problems and revived old city structures. 
No such system exists yet in the United 
States, but, thanks to a group formed by 
GMU, the first maglev line in the U.S. 
could be right here in Pittsburgh.
In May of 1989, CMU established the 
Maglev Working Group, comprised of 
numerous labor, industry, and govern
ment organizations to find a solution to 
Pittsburghs transportation problems.
The Working Group was the first of its 
kind in the United States with objectives 
to revive the nations industrial base, 
create jobs, and solve the transportation 
problems of the country.
Shortly after the Working Group was 
formed, Dr. Richard Cyert, created the 
High-Speed Ground Transportation 
(HSGT) Center as part of Mellon Insti
tute. The HSGT Center and the Work
ing Group produced a preliminary feasi
bility study last February for the con
struction of a 19-mile prototype maglev 
line from Pittsburghs downtown area to 
Greater Pittsburgh International Air
port, as well as other routes in the area.
Magnetic levitation is a connected se
ries of passenger cars elevatedjust inches 
above a guide rail by powerful electro
magnets. Current maglev systems are 
capable of speeds over 300 miles per 
hour. Such a system could carry passen
gers from downtown to the airport in ten 
minutes, normally a thirty minute drive.
Not only will maglev solve Pittsburghs 
transportation problems, but it will re
vive the citys beleaguered industrial base 
and create thousands of jobs. Maglev, 
Inc. has attracted many local organiza
tions including the United Steelworkers 
of America, AEG Westinghouse Trans
portation Systems, Inc., and the USX 
Corporation, who have all invested a 
tremendous amount of time and money 
in the project.
The benefits of magnetic levitation far 
outweigh the benefits of any conven
tional forms of transportation. Maglev is 
fast, efficient, easy to construct, requires 
low maintenance, and is pollution-free. 
Dr. Richard Uher, Director of the HSGT 
Center, feels that maglev is an excellent 
economic activity generator for Pitts
burgh.
Several departments at CMU have 
created student projects to study various 
aspects of the maglev project. Engineer
ing and Public Policy, Social and Decision 
Sciences, and SUPA grad students are 
divided into three groups to study maglev 
technology, routes and financing, and 
manufacture of the system in the Pitts
burgh area.
Toby Davis, CMU professor of Eco
nomics and Public Policy, feels this proj ect 
provides students with practical experi
ence. The intention of this project is to 
educate students on a real problem. 
There are many social, economic, and 
technological aspects to most real prob
lems. I want them to get real-life expe
rience.
There are many maglev systems cur
rently being designed across the U.S. A 
20-mile line connecting the Orlando 
airport with Disney World could become 
Americas first maglev line in 1994, pos
ing competition for Maglev, Inc. to get 
the Pittsburgh project off the ground
quickly. However, money has become 
the largest single barrier for any maglev 
system.
There have been numerous appeals to 
the federal government by maglev groups 
for grants to study and create maglev 
systems. Construction of a maglev line 
in Las Vegas was abandoned in late 
August due to lack of funding.
Estimated costs for a national system 
are close to $211 billion. Costs for a 
maglev line in Pittsburgh from down
town to the airport range between $300 
to $650 million, depending on chosen 
route and configuration. To complicate 
matters, annual operating costs will vary 
from $2.4 to $11.5 million. Officials at
Maglev, Inc. understand that farebox 
revenues will have to be supplemented' 
by government grants, private funds, 
and foreign investments.
However, Dr. Uher estimates that older 
forms of transportation will be far more 
expensive in the long run. Traffic jams 
and airline delays will waste thousands 
of hours and cost passengers $13 billion, 
a year by 2005.
Despite the costs, maglev is the epitome 
of economic development for the Pitts
burgh area. Maglev is anticipated to 
generate tremendous revenues for the 
city, stimulate job growth, attract new 
businesses, and lead the United States 
into the 21st century in grand style.
Club Anonymous outfits its customers with vintage clothing
While muted trumpets blared 
one lick after another behind a 
scatting Louie Prima, I took a 
final glance in the mirror to make 
sure my skinny-brimmed fedora, 
an item which should really be a 
fixed feature of the human head 
at birth, was cocked to the left at 
exactly the right angle. Just then 
a fairly soft voice sounded from 
behind a rack of double-breasted 
suits. "You look like Frank, said 
the voice. As I turned and matched 
a face to the voice, there was no 
need to ask of which Frank that 
Club Anonymous owner Paula 
was speaking. The name Frank 
alone was enough to put us on the 
same wavelength.
; Mahoneys Club Anonymous, 
Ideated on Morewood Avenue, is a 
small vintage clothing store 
which, despite its physical size, 
stands considerably tall in the 
nostalgia category. The store, 
which interestingly enough 
opened on April Fools Day of1979,
WHATEVER HAPPENED TO 
PLATINUM BLONDES?
by Andrew Cosentino
sells a wide range of clothing and 
accessories dating back to the 20s 
through the 60s. For Mahoney, 
who could probably make more 
money by owning a similar store 
of a cheesier nature, running Club 
Anonymous is a labor of love. 
Mahoney not only restores cloth
ing, she tags each article with 
information about its age and his
tory, she hunts down and re-fin
ishes the furniture on which her 
goods sit and hang, and she styles 
her own ads. Club Anonymous, 
however, is a classy shop which 
contains goods in fine condition.
By no means is it a museum or 
rummage-sale type store. I dont 
want people to feel like theyre in 
an attic, nor do I want it to smell 
that way. After twelve years in 
the business, Mahoneys verdict 
is that the majority of people are 
hip to it.
Unless, God forbid, youre in 
search of a leisure suit and moon 
shoes, its hard not to be hip to 
Club Anonymous. Besides carry
ing some extremely classy mens 
and womens clothing, the store 
has a wide variety of goods that 
cant be found in most other places. 
For example, when was the last 
time you were presented with the 
option of buying a pair of wingtipped buck shoes, a set of soda 
fountain chairs from the 50s, and 
a maroon, silk smoking jacket in 
the same store? OK, forget the 
chairs and shoes, when was the 
last time you walked into a store 
and saw a smoking jacket for sale 
all by itself? Something must be
seriously wrong with the model of 
supply and demand because I 
know tons of people who would 
pay good money for a smoking 
jacket, yet you just dont see too 
many of them around. Damn 
shame.
After eying the smoking jacket 
for a good ten minutes, I was sure 
it was my favorite item in the 
store. However, this was before I 
stumbled upon a rack of old 
bowling shirts. As I tried on what 
used to be Tommys (his name 
was on the front pocket) baby 
blue bowling shirt, I noticed a 
patch on the sleeve which read, 
1963-64 League Champions. One 
can only imagine the stories be
hind a shirt like Tommys. Back 
in the days when he splintered 
pins on a championship team of 
hard-workers from the Melody 
Shop. Stories which took place 
many league nights ago, in a 
bowling alley far, far away....
Come on Tommy boy, blow em
down, shouted Mel from the 
candy machine at Colonial Lanes 
that night. Tommy was far too 
busy drying his clammy hand and 
staring at the five pins still 
standing to hear Mel or any of his 
other buddies. Nonetheless, he 
knew as well as they did that a 
spare would clinch it for the 
Melody Shop, and wanted noth
ing more than to snatch the title 
from his bitter rivals, Hals Ga
rage. Those jerks couldnt even 
carry a tune.
Tommy, now regretting that 
chili dog he picked up on the way 
to the alleys, steps out onto the 
pinewood floor. Bending over with 
his lucky ball held out in front of 
his face and slightly less than half 
his behind exposed to the scoring 
table, Tommy stares hard and 
goes into his delivery. As the ball 
glides down the lane, he drops to 
his knees, eyebrows knit ... 
SPARE!!!
After taking a good while to get
back on his feet, Tommy is car-; 
ried off by a mass of co-workers 
garbed in baby-blue, leaving be
hind a stunned Hals Garage....
When I finally snapped out of it, *
I took off the magic dream shirt 
and put it back on the rack next to 
another especially large bowling 
shirt that used to belong to a guy. 
named J oily. As I wandered to the 
back of the store I became sur
rounded by the kind of classic 
threads worn in movies like Guys! 
and Dolls.
But I decided not to try on any
more fedoras or suits that day for 
fear of an uncontrollable desire to 
break out in song about horse 
races in front of the other custom
ers. Club Anonymous in a word?! 
Slick.

Shahrough Akhavi lectures on the Middle East
By COLLEEN KANE
Tartan Staffwriter 
Shahrough Akhavi, a highly 
regarded authority concerning 
Middle East politics, lectured in 
Doherty Hall on Thursday, Octo
ber 4,1990, on The Gulf Conflict: 
American Policy and the Crisis in 
Arab Politics.
The lecture consisted of four 
main points. First, Akhavi ex
plained the historical background 
Saddam Husseins objectives were 
the second topicof discussion. The 
role of the United States in the 
1980s vis-a-vis Iraq and Iraqs 
actions formed the third segment. 
Akhavi concluded by combining 
these three topics to show the net 
effect upon the Arab states.
Husseins objectives, according 
to Akhavi, can be boiled down 
into four main categories. If Iraq 
can maintain control over 
Kuwaits oil supply, it will double 
its reserves and hence increase
its purchasing power for social 
projects and military endeavors. 
By dominating Kuwait, Iraq can 
also reduce its national debt since 
the majority of it is owed to Ku
wait. Also, some people believe 
that Kuwait belongs to Iraq, be
cause it was partitioned off by the 
British inl899 andgrantedindependence in 1961 without the say 
of the Iraqis. Lastly, the current 
power play, from Akhavis stand
point, indicates that Hussein as
pires to be the leader of the Arab 
world, realizing the dreams if 
Egypts President Nasser.
Of these objectives, Akhavi be
lieves that only three are legiti
mate causes for action. The terri
torial issue, though it does seek to 
rectify a past injustice, is nonnegotiable with other countries. 
However, Akhavi believes that 
the economic issues are open for 
diplomatic discussion. The eco
nomic issues refer to the fact that
Kuwait produced twice its OPEC 
allottment of oil from 1986to 1988 
, driving down the price of oil. 
Iraq also claims that Kuwait pil
fered oil out of a petroleum-rich 
lake that lies along their borders 
during the Iran-Iraq war during 
approximately the same time 
frame.
According to Akhavis projec
tion, if the United States pursues 
military action, the current 
alignment with Middle Eastern 
countries will quickly vanish. 
More probable, from Akhavis 
standpoint, there will be an inter
national conference to not only 
decide the Kuwait-Iraq conflict 
but the Palestine Gaza Strip 
question as well.
The talk was officially entitled 
and was the second lecture this 
semester sponsored by the 
Presidents Distinguished Lecture 
Series. Professor John Modell, 
faculty director of the lecture se
ries, introduced Akhavi and de
scribed the distinguished 
speakers qualifications. He has 
written several books about the 
Middle East, the most recent be
ing Religion and Politics in Con
temporary Iran. He has also 
authored numerous articles 
concerning the Middle East and 
the Iranian Revolution. 
Shahrough Akhavi has earned a 
Bachelors degree in interna
tional studies from Brown Uni
versity, a masters in the Middle 
Eastern Regional studies from 
Harvard University and a doc
torate of Political Science from 
Columbia University. Cur
rently, he is a professor of Gov
ernment and International 
Studies at the University of South 
Carolina.

Hundreds of alumni return 
each fall to the Carnegie Mellon 
campus for the annual Home
coming festivities. Although the 
lack of an on-campus football 
stadium for the past two years 
put something of a damper on 
88-89 Homecoming activities, 
alumni came out in full force 
this fall.
For many undergraduates, it 
was the first time to come into 
contact with a large number of 
alumni of such diverse ages and 
backgrounds.
Many students were inter
ested to know why alumni did 
or did not come back for Home
coming.
This week, The Tartan decided 
to ask students whether they 
would come back for Homecom
ing after they graduate.________

that occurred and the progress 
made by the school. I would also 
like to see old friends.
Will Arick 
Sophomore, MCS
I will  at least once. Its 
nice to come back to your past 
and hopefully within the next 
four yearslll have some pride 
in this place.
Jim Shih 
Sophomore, CIT
I suppose. It will be nice to 
come back to this school to relax, 
and not feel the pressure I fell 
now.
Kali Rocha 
Sophomore, CFA
Because of the major that Im 
in, itll be hard for me to come 
back. Id come back for the re
unions instead to see my friends.
Klshor Rao/Tartan Photographer 
Nick Lewis 
Freshman, CFA
I want to come back and see 
what all the women I dated 
look like in twenty years.

NATIONAL COMING OUT DAY
11 October 1990
I fully support National Coming Out Day. I acknowledge the 
difficulties lesbian, gay, and bisexual people may encounter  as a 
result of societal prejudice and intolerancein embracing their 
sexuality. It is important that we insure the rights of all people 
without regard to their sexual orientation. We must work together 
to create a society free from prejudice and intolerance.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  8 October 1990L5
Superman, Batman, and zit-cream ads engender harmful stereotypes
One week ago I did something 
that really made me happy. The 
poster Man came to campus, and 
as I thumbed through the stacks 
of the usual posters found in col
lege student apartments (Robert 
Smith beating up on Arnold 
Swarzenegger, The Red Hot Chili 
Peppers eating Monets Water 
Lillies, David Bowie pondering 
upon Jim Morrisons skull ) I 
came across the poster for Su
perman The Movie. Needless to 
say, a trip to the bank machine 
downstairs is alf it took.
A few words about Superman 
The Movie. It is perhaps the best 
example of American pop culture 
ever committed to film, manag
ing to be an immigrant story, a 
Christ story and one of the few 
movies between 1979-1985 in 
which the presence of tights did 
not immediately signal herecomes-the-big-disco-aerobicsbobbing-buttocks-training-sequence!
Second, Superman The Movie 
is the only film where Cheerios 
appear not only on the screen 
(surprisingly the only example of 
product placement in the movie) 
but are also mentioned in the 
closing credits. Watch for it 
somewhere between Best Boy 
and Key Grip; it has the caption 
Cheerios by General Mills. Ac
tually, dont watch for it because 
SupermanThe Movie also has the 
semi-dubious distinction of hav
ing the longest credit sequence in 
film history, clocking, in at just 
over ten minutes.
Finally, this is the only film I 
can remember that consistently 
wrenches tears out of me. Go 
ahead and laugh, but that scene 
in the wheat field where Clark 
Kent leaves the family farm has 
always been a three bucket affair 
for me. The verdict is still pend
ing in this category, though, since 
I have yet to see Old Yeller.
WHO IS JAVI?
by Javier Grillo-Marxuach
The poster I bought features a 
Superman logo in shimmering 
silver, descending through a field 
of blue and grey clouds alongside 
a spinning shaft of primary-col
ored light. Below the illustration 
is the legend Youll Believe a Man 
Can Fly, which evokes the 
memory of an innocent time when 
studios had the balls to issue strict 
edicts as part of film advertising 
and I was enough of a ten-yearold to part with my disbelief. Not 
only is the poster a thing of beauty, 
but also something which I con
sider an important cultural sign 
post. For these and many other 
reasons, the poster now hangs 
proudly in my room.
The reason I mention all of this 
is because on the day I bought the 
Superman poster, I was leafing 
through the pages of U. Maga
zine. U. Magazine is that an
noying compilation of prophylac
tic, computer, beer and zit cream 
advertisements which periodi
cally appears stuck between the 
pages of The Tartan. The best use 
that I have found for U. Magazine 
thus far is to use it as a distraction 
during that long and embarassing 
period of time which transpires 
between the time you see a casual 
acquaintance fifty meters away 
from you on the Cut and the time 
in which the person is within 
hearing distance.
Every once in a while, stories 
appear on the pages of U. Maga
zine in order to link the adver
tisements together. The one that 
caught my eye this time around
read Batman Combats Campus 
Evils.
A stark black and white picture 
on the center of the page shows 
this Batman. He is a sophomore 
in the University of Nebraska 
who, after seeing the movie ver
sion of Batman, was inspired by 
the caped crusaders policy of 
giving everybody a fair chance. 
In fact, he was so inspired that he 
went out, spent three hundred 
dollars on a Batman costume and 
now applies Batmans school of 
thought to his everyday life.
Normally, I would just dismiss 
this as another moron incapable 
of distinguishing reality from 
fiction, except that on that same 
day, somebody I was having a 
conversation with compared me 
to this jerk upon noticing that I 
wear a Batman watch.
Having a Superman poster un
der my arm at the time the com
parison was made did not help my 
frame of mind. I am a fan of the 
superhero genre. Unfortunately, 
this always draws me into com
parisons with people like the 
cowled Nebraskan in U. Maga
zine . The fact that the Campus 
Batman story ran on the same 
page as Assasination Game 
Turns Students into Psychopaths 
didnt help either. In any case, by 
the time that whoever it is that I 
am talking to notices the Batman 
watch I have to be ready to reel off 
the standard reply:
I only wear the watch because 
I didnt like the movie and I like to 
remind myself of the mediocrity 
of the s o ciety which m ade it a hit. 
Actually, this isnt entirely true. 
True, I didnt like the movie, but 
if I were to be honest about it, the 
reply would go a lot more likeAlthough I wear a Batman 
watch I would like to assure you 
that this is based on an apprecia
tion of Batman which has in no 
way impeded my ability to bathe,

sustain fulfilling relationships 
with members of the opposite sex, 
keep up the receiving end of a 
stimulating conversation about 
any topic which you are willing to 
toss in, or live an independent life 
in which reality is not compro
mised by the belief that if I buy 
myself a costume I will immedi
ately be able to find and solve 
crimes.
But it goes a little bit deeper 
than the concern that another 
person will judge my hygienic 
habits by the watch that I wear. 
The sense of smell should suffice. 
My concern lies in the principle of 
guilt by association.
Just like that little kid who 
stuffed a towel into his collar and 
died after jumping off the third 
story of an apartment building, 
providing many a mother with 
the ammunition with which to 
obliterate countless afternoons of 
spirited fun for me and millions of 
prepubescent children (my child
hood equivalent of youll shoot 
your eye out), the fact that a 
person who puts on a Batman 
outfit and claims to put wrongs to 
right actually gets some level of 
attention means that anybody else 
who loves superhero stories is 
going to be judged by this yard
stick.
You dont believe me? What 
about the prejudice that in order 
to be a fan of Star Trek one has to 
be a sexually repressed man who 
actually believes that William 
Shatnerhas acting ability? What 
about the belief that all sports
fans carry three stones around 
their waists, drink beer and 
scratch their genitalia in public? 
What about the wisdom which 
states that all members of fra
ternities take advantage of 
women? What about the convic
tion that all inner city blacks lis
ten to loud music from ghettoblasters? What about the com
mon knowledge that Asians are 
lousy drivers? What about the 
impression that all Puerto Ricans 
carry knives and spray paint on 
subways while singing I Like to 
Live in America?
What bothers me is that after 
the U. Magazine article dealing 
with Campus Batman goes to 
great lengths to retell the exploits 
of this student (he claims to have 
saved several teenagers from 
bullying gangs and to have left 
the people who have encountered 
him in awe) it closes with a 
quote in which he claims that he 
has told no one about his noctur
nal abilities because they prob
ably wouldnt understand... they 
would say he has been watching 
too many movies.
No, it has nothing to do with 
watchingtoo many movies. Inmy 
opinion, there can be no such thing 
as watching too many movies. 
What it does mean is that some
where, this individual lost track 
of the idea that after a certain age 
it is wise to stop tucking a towel 
into the shirt collar in a literal 
sense and to pursue a similar goal 
in a more figurative manner. For 
many, movies such as Superman
AB
The Movie served as a center of 
inspiration, an example of the 
power of a medium to inspire and 
tell a thrilling story.
I am one of these people. At age 
ten I knew that I wanted to 
dedicate my life to telling stories, 
a result of movies like Superman 
and Star Wars. My towel re
turned to the task of drying my 
body soon thereafter.
As for applying Batmans 
school of thought to every day, 
the central theme of Batman is 
that of a person who has been 
unable to outgrow a childhood 
obsession with a concept of justice 
which, in its own child-like way, 
is much too simple-minded to 
represent even the individual who 
attempts to enforce it. In the 
same way, the crux of the story of 
Superman The Movie is the pur
suit of a compromise to individual 
integrity in the face of a seemingly 
unbending system of ethics and 
duty.
For casting such a demeaning 
light on the rest of us, the only 
fitting punishment I can think of 
for this collegiate caped crusader 
is that he may have the snot 
beaten out of him by a squadron 
of fourteen year old Pittsburghers 
in ninja outfits. Unfortunately, 
this comeuppance represents the 
kind of justice that usually ap
pears only in comic books.
One final note. I could not help 
but notice the large chalked 
messages found last Friday on 
the Skibo steps and the pavement 
in front of the library. The mes
sages read ALL GUYS SUCK. 
Which is why I would like to end 
this column with three words of 
reply to whoever it was who wrote 
this.

I wouldve bought a Macintosh even without 
the student discount.
Greg Gallent
Consumer Economics and Housing 
Cornell University
The first time I saw a Macintosh, I was immediately 
hooked. Its a work of art. I saw the student 
pricing and my next move was obvious: get one.
Some other computers are cheaper, but theyre 
a pain to learn, and working on them can be 
a grueling experience. Last year, a friend 
bought another kind of computer against 
my advice and has used it for maybe 15 
hours.What a waste.
Macintosh, on the other hand, is a logical 
extension of the mind. It lets you concentrate on 
whats mV your paper, not on how to get it NV 
paper. You can create professional-looking 
documents in minutes, and you lose the fear of 
learning new programs because they all work 
in the same way
Once youve worked with a Macintosh, 
theres no turning back!

John Tanner collides with the first amendment
You know, theres something 
about the state of Florida that 
makes me wonder why its not 
considered the deepest part of the 
deep south, unlike Georgia, Ala
bama, and Mississippi.
Perhaps its because most ofthe 
yankee senior citizens who can 
retire comfortably in a warm cli
mate want to move there. How
ever, the shrinking fraction of the 
population in Florida who are 
southerners are trying to make 
up for it by spreading the south a 
little too thickly on their shortnin 
bread.
The southern qualities that they 
are trying to preserve are not necessarilythebest. Forget lazy days 
on the porch and jumping barbed 
wire fences, hanky-panky with 
Lilah Mae and mint juleps. Lets 
go straight to church now and 
make central Florida the deepest 
pit of hell for the open-minded.
Ladies and gentlemen, lets say 
hello to our newest defender of 
good ole American democracy: 
John Tanner, Florida State At
torney, who believes that pornog
raphy is the root of all sexual 
crime.
Welcome, one and all, to the 
army of the Good Lord. Repent 
now or see your basic sexual 
freedom (which you were never 
meant to have) ripped away with 
the first Debbie Does Dallas 
video you rent at the local store.
Welcome, one and all, to a purge 
of sex-oriented activity in Central 
Florida. Never mind the Fangoria 
magazines on the bottom shelves 
of the magazine rack within reach 
of three-year-olds, never mind the 
fact that automatic guns in 
Florida are perfectly available to 
any felon with no wait and a 
drivers license.
We are here to stop sexy 
thinking. We are here to stop the 
polluting of the mind, and we are
SOUTHERN COMFORT
by Alison Carter
going to begin by ripping pornog
raphy from the shelves of our 
town, sweet Volusia!
Volusia county seems all around 
to be the land of extremes, doesnt 
it? (My family lives there, and 
although they may like to call 
themselves open-minded in the 
matters of such things as pornog
raphy, they are still victims of 
uncontrolled extremes.)
Now this is the attitude that we 
are facing, and it is fast becoming 
the one to integrate itself into the 
very structure of Capitol Hill. I 
am still stifled by the South when 
I pick up a newspaper or maga
zine. I happened to get quite a lot 
of news about Mr. Tanner from 
the Playboy forum. That maga
zine, of course, has probably long 
been removed from bookshelves 
in Volusia, so most people there 
have only the Song of Solomon to 
which they can fantasize, and ei
ther Mr. Tanner or the Book of 
Leviticus to provide solid opin
ions on sexual activity.
It looks like we will have another 
short period where McCarthyism
will rule again. But this time it 
wont be a Commie List; it will be 
a Sex Perverts Who Deserve to 
Have Their Souls Damned Eter
nally to Hell list.
Fortunately, the rule of 
McCarthyism did not last long. 
The people who followed the fear 
fad soon lost it out of apathy, and 
as a result of our slow-to-rise 
tolerance of certain idealogies, we 
have finally witnessed the death 
of hard-line Communism.
If we, as Americans, refuse to 
follow one-sided fear campaigns 
like that of Tanner, does that 
mean we can stop sexual abuse 
and crime?
We stopped worrying about 
Communism seeping into the 
fabric of American democracy be
cause it didnt happen. The only 
way it would have is if we had 
outlawed it entirely. Then Com
munism would have had the lure 
of hardcore and violent pom.
If we take the opposite path 
that Tanner wants all of us to 
take, then the thrill of doing 
something forbidden or violently 
sexual might die out.
We could soon be healthy, openminded tolerant people in a soci
ety without exploitation or sexual 
violence, simply because we would 
be free and educated. Not re
pressed.
Unfortunately, such is not the 
case. People will still blindly fol
low single-minded leaders till the

Human race dies out.
What made Mr. Tanner the De
fender of American Decency? It 
could have been a great number 
of influences.
Perhaps the first time Tanner 
experienced an ejaculation was 
the night before he went to church 
and the preacher warned about 
the dangers of carnal thought.
Perhaps its just plain personal 
fear for the state of his own soul, 
and hes turning it into politics.
Perhaps he is just using it for 
power and ego in the South dur
ing the age of AIDS and violent 
pom, while he feeds on the fear of 
the uneducated.
Satirizing Mr. Tanners ideals 
is like trying to satirize the 
Skinheads or the American Nazi 
Party: you can still laugh at them 
for being idiots, but they have to 
be given boundaries before their 
fascist ideals mn amok and into 
the fabric of democracy.

HERES PROOFTAKE THE $50.00 CHALLENGE
K.C. Houston, Tx. File HI 951 was working 2 
jobs and just barely getting by. I began using 
your program 2 months ago and I now make 
more money in I month than I did all last 
year. Thank-you so much for your easy to 
operate program.
M.L. Sterling, Va. File #2251 have never seen 
a program so easy to operate as yours. 
Believe me I have sent for numerous so called 
get rich schemes. None of them worked and 
they just cost me money. I started your 
program for less than $10.00 and I now earn 
over 524,000.00 per month. Thank-you so 
much.
C.C. Albany, NY File K273 Thank you very 
much for allowing me the opportunity to 
participate in your "Deluxe Money-Making 
Program.  It has changed my entire life. 1 
deposited 518,500.00 in my checking account 
last month.
T.J. Stuart, FI File K318 I was skeptical when 
I heard about your program. / thought it was 
one of those get rich quick schemes to con 
people. I figured what the heck, either I 
make the money you say or I get my money 
back plus 550.00. Well was 1 wrong.  To 
think, I almost passed this opportunity up. I 
now earn more money in one month than I 
made all last year. Thank you Ron.

Flying Pigs take off in a Volkswagen
By MARNIBOREK
Tartan Staffwriter
its not a bird, its not a plane, 
ItfC- its  the Flying Pig?
| $o, its not a mutated farm 
animal. Its the newest theater in 
iftsburgh run by Carnegie 
Vlellon students and alumni. In 
ts first performance, atthe Artery 
n Shadyside on October 20, the 
;heater group will introduce its 
mprovisation company, Reality 
Dptional.
The Flying Pig theater was 
I formed during the summer by 
penior history major Jessie Ramey 
|and CMU alumna Tamar 
Copeland. Their main goal was to 
>x#pse local talent.
In the coming months, were 
joing to be out on an edge taking 
isks, trying to promote 
Jittsburghs budding artists  
jlaywrights, musicians, directors, 
md actors, said Ramey, now 
[eneral manager of the Flying
Both she and Copeland, the aristfc director, have made sacri
fices to put together the project. 
The project is completely out of 
our pockets right now until we get 
funding, said Remey. We have 
to establish ourselves before get
ting grants.
Reality Optional, a subsidiary 
of the Flying Pig, is comprised of 
approximately sixteen people. The 
groups performances vary de
pending on audience input.
Improv is the creative process 
at work right in front of you, said 
Copeland. We take an emotion 
or a movie title from an audience 
member and build an entire scene 
out of it.
To understand this improvisa
tion technique fully, one must take 
a behind the scenes look at the 
company at work.
The Volkswagen Peace and 
Love van pulls up in front of 
Skibo. The Zimmerman mobile 
has arrived, announces Michael 
Walker, a sophomore computer 
science major.
Walker clambers into the van 
followed by fellow Scotch TSP Soda 
members Eugene Kuo, a sopho
more mechanical engineer major, 
Louis Smolenski, a sophomore 
electrical engineering major, and 
Jenny Adams, a sophomore H&SS 
student.
The van noisily makes its way 
out of the parking lot and the 
group is whisked away to a nearby 
Shadyside apartment, where the 
group is greeted by other Reality 
members  Laura Lind, Kym 
Helbig, and Fed Hattoum. Five 
minutes later, Copeland arrives, 
ready to get down to business.
All announcements are made. 
Adams stands up to initiate one of 
the companys funniest improvi
sations.
Could I please have three ob
jects that you may find in your 
pocket or on your person? Now 
these actors will tell you why these 
objects are important to them. 
They may or may not stay the 
same.
Michael muses over the Swiss 
army knife Jenny has handed to 
him. An impish smile lights up 
his face as he discovers the objects 
importance to him.
Long live and prosper, right? 
he says. You see, I love Star Trek. 
I had my name changed to Spock 
Simpson just, cause I liked the 
sound of it  the alliteration. I 
went to this final shooting of Star 
Trek: The Last Generation and got 
this... this communicator/phaser/ 
weapon that fits in everywhere. 
He holds up the knife.
As one might conclude, acting 
does not play an exclusive role in 
Reality Optional. The group is 
held together not only by the or
ganizational skills of its leaders, 
Ramey and Copeland, but by the 
improvisational skills of the 
companys members.
Its not only acting, its being 
able to come up with a creative 
story to act out in a short time, 
says Ramey.
The Flying Pig soars to Hiram 
College in Hiram, Ohio next 
month, so catch its group of tal
ented improvisors next week at 
the Artery. After all, when else 
could your pocketknife be trans
formed into a complex space 
weapon?

Its October, and the new television 
season is well underway. Knowing all 
the academic and social pressures that 
Carnegie Mellon students are under, this 
handy TV guide can help busy students 
decide which programs are worth their 
valuable time.
What follows is a brief and extremely 
subjective look at whats worth watching 
on TV this season. The programs are 
listed roughly in chronological order.
Tiny Toon Adventures (Monday to 
Friday at 4:30 pm on ch. 53). Completely 
divorced from reality (and proud of it), 
this show is a combination of all the good 
stuff  the old Warner Bros, cartoons, 
Roger Rabbit, andtheNewAdventures of 
Mighty Mouse. Its wild, its zany, its just 
plain fun.
Murphy Brown (Monday at 9 pm on 
ch. 2). Week in and week out, the funni
est show on television. Candice Bergen 
heads a very talented and incredibly 
funny cast.
Roseanne (Tuesday at 9 pm on ch. 4). 
Okay, she cant sing, but her show is 
funny, and, at times, touching. Not ev
eryone likes Roseanne, but every epi
sode is well-written and gives a view of 
family life that seems a little more real
istic than the experiences of the Seavers,
Hogans, Huxtables, etc. Plus, John 
Goodman and Sara Gilbert turn in fabu
lous performances every week.
The Wonder Years (Wednesday at 8 
pm on ch. 4). Who among us hasnt at 
least once seen a childhood memory re
lived by Kevin Arnold and his friends? 
Sometimes funny, sometimes painful, 
but almost always right on the nose.
Doctor, Doctor (Wednesday at 8:30 
pm on ch. 2). Worth watching just to see 
frenetic Matt Frewer do his thing. (Love 
the hair!)
Doogie Howser, M.D. (Wednesday at
9 pm on ch. 4). I dont care what anyone 
else says  I like this show. Suspend 
your disbelief for a while and check out 
Neil Patrick Harris and Max Casella  
two of the better young actors on the tube 
today.
 The Simpsons (Thursday at 8 pm on 
ch. 53). Weve suffered through reruns 
long enough  new episodes are here, 
and they look like winners. Look for 
major changes in Homer, both physi
cally and psychologically.
Cheers (Thursday at 9 pm on ch. 11). 
In its ninth season, this sitcom is as fresh 
and funny as ever. Sam has his bar back, 
and Rebeccas a waitress  sort of a full 
360 from the original concept. Look for 
the 200th episode special later in No
vember.

ichael Keaton just reeks of evil in his newest role as a pyschotic 
pnnant In Pacific Heights.
By MIKE SHAPIRO
Tartan Staffwriter
Demand me nothing. What you 
know, you know. From this time 
forth I will never speak a word. 
These final words of Iago, the 
diabolical evildoer from 
Shakespeares Othello, belie those 
characteristics that make him the 
quintessence of villainy: a hor
rible competence at malice, and a 
complete lack of any ascertainable 
motive. Evil for evils sake.
I bring this up not to impress 
you with my literary pomposity, 
but rather to draw a parallel. For 
the recently released actionthriller Pacific Heights distin
guishes itself by presenting the 
most biting tale of interwoven 
vengeance since the enraged Moor 
finally had at it with his schem
ing lieutenant.
Pacific Heights doesnt try to 
overwhelm you with an escalat
ing Rangarok between the main 
characters, d la a sullen version 
of War of the Roses. Rather, the 
scenario is chillingly possible, in 
spite of the coat of horror-movie 
overtones.
The protagonistic couple, Drake 
Goodman (Matthew Modine) and
 Movie Review 
PACIFIC HEIGHTS. Ayoung 
couple make the mistake of renting 
out a room in their Victorian home 
to a psychotic tennant, Star-ring 
Melanie Griffith, Matthew Modine, 
and Michael Keaton.
Patty Palmer (Melanie Griffith), 
together embody the troddenupon affability that every misfor
tune flick tries to flesh out its 
characters withsimply because 
theres no personality archetype 
thats more fun to run through 
the garnet of ruin. How wouldy ou 
feel if some malefic criminal me
thodically twisted the arteries of 
your well-being until you bled 
dollars? By strapping such bland, 
likeable folk into the victims seat, 
Pacific Heights gives you an idea.
Drake and his perky girlfriend, 
in a fit of tacit innocence, try to 
steady their precarious financial 
circumstance by leasing out the 
two apartments of their newlypurchased Victorian home. Into 
one moves Carter Hayes, a seem
ing godsend of a tenant. Hes in
telligent, well-mannered, and has 
assets flowing from every pore.
Melinda Sue Gordon/1990 Morgan Creek Film Partners 
Michael Keaton and Melanie Griffith share a tender moment In Pacific 
Heights.
Except hes also Michael Keaton, He is. After moving in, Hayes 
and since weve seen him shrouded initiates a campaign of mampuominously on the movie poster lative, impersonal antagonism 
out in the theater lobby, he must upon the poor landlords, first 
be the bad guy. Please see HEIGHTS, page L15

Learn how to write like Joe Bob
The High Sheriffs in Dallas 
sponsored a contest last month 
called Any Idiot Can Write Like 
Joe Bob, and the results  lets 
see, how can I say this?  the 
results were ... uh ... scary. Not 
only did the contestants come up 
with 984 new words for female 
breasts. Not only did they manage 
to figure out every cheap trick Ive 
' used for the last nine years. But 
an enormous number of them 
wrote with the assumption that: 
a) anyone who writes like Joe Bob 
must have a venereal disease, b) 
anybody who writes like Joe Bob 
must be drunk at least 18 hours a 
day, and c) anybody who writes 
like Joe Bob could never get a 
woman to go to bed with him.
These are, of course, lies and 
misconceptions. A woman went 
to bed with me in 1984.
A few excerpts from the thou
sands of entries (actually it was 
only 200, but everyone expects 
me to be a liar, too):
In the Middle Ages, when a 
woman started acting a little out 
of line and a sensible Middle Ages 
guy had trouble understandin her, 
a well-trained doctor would come 
and drain off a few quarts of blood 
usually from a small hole drilled 
behind her ear. Every once in a 
while, a lady would die from this, 
but that isnt the point. The point 
is that they tried
I just wanted to tell you, Joe 
Bob, that you and Festus Hagan 
are my idols. 
Two girls, both blonde, both 
seventeen, and both with the same 
venereal infection, Kim and Col
leen discovered their friendship 
was destined to be.
Her white shorts became 
transparent after being drenched, 
and her Garfield Day-of-the-Week 
panties were shinin through. She 
hoped no one would see. 
Dyed-Blonde Fat Chicks in

her teeth like a person whos had 
a 55 Dodge pickup loaded with 
salt-licks lifted off her chest.

is balanced by an equally strong 
desire to punish himself to alle
viate the guilty residue of his 
former, purer life.
St. John also pours unexpected 
bits of humor into the role, espe
cially through the repetition of 
Shannons favorite word fantas
tic. There is not an emotion or 
thought that Shannon cant fully 
express with the simple excla
mation, fantastic!
Olivia Williams keeps up with 
St. John as earthy Maxine, 
Shannons friend who knows him 
only too well. During his fits of 
hysteria she usually watches 
calmly, but knows exactly when 
desperate actions are necessary. 
Williams brings a powerful but 
playful element to the character, 
reminiscent of Ava Gardners 
performance in the film version of 
the play.
Williams focuses on the 
survivalist that Maxine is. There 
are times that Shannon or 
Hannah may be having difficul
ties, but Williams shows through 
a look or a stance that Maxine 
thinks of her self first. She can 
hear the iguana desperately 
scratching beneath her veranda 
and yet she plans to eat the ani
mal at her first opportunity.
Helena Ruoti breathes life into 
a potentially lifeless role. As the 
self-proclaimed New England 
spinster Hannah, Ruoti plays the 
part down to the last detail. The 
crisp accent and ill-at-ease man
nerisms are just two ways that 
Ruoti makes Hannah believable 
and intriguing.
Delightful supporting roles also 
crop up in this play. Yancey Arias 
and Scott Foster give sensual, 
almost animal performances as 
Pedro and Pancho, while John 
Hall also deserves notice for his 
comical performance as 
Shannons colleague and victim 
Hank.
Tennessee Williams is not 
known for a light-hearted view of 
the world. Williams most often 
paints a portrait of inescapable

in their own failures, someone

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  8 October 1990LL5
Thirteen proves unlucky for Piers Anthony
By MARK ROCES
! Tartan Staffwriter
Piers Anthony has turned the 
Xanth series  originally a tril
ogy  int an endurance sport, 
popping out about a book a year, 
this author seems to be tiring in 
his latest novel, Isle of View.
Isle is the thirteenth Xanth 
novel written by Anthony. It 
seems, however, that thirteen is 
not his lucky number.
Still pickling his readers with 
puns, Anthony bombards us with 
an all-star Xanth cast in an at
tempt to bring back any feeling 
left in his faithful yet, by now, 
numbed audience. Isle of View 
picks up where the previous novel, 
Man from Mundania, left, or 
.father, dropped off.
Prince Dolph is still betrothed 
(.to two fiances. One of which is

of you possibly fortunate people 
who arent familiar with Xanth,

is a half-human, half-snake crea
ture who can change form at will), 
who was betrothed to Dolph for 
political reasons. The other is 
Electra (dont worry, shes hu
man), a spiteful, youthful girl (de
spite having been bom a thou
sand years ago) who was awak
ened from her long sleep by the 
prince.
Dolphs predicament is that he 
cannot marry one without seri
ous consequences for the other, 
and, although this is a fantasy 
novel, he cannot marry both.
But Dolph must put aside his 
dilemma for the momentwhich 
is no big deal, considering it was 
dragged over from the last two 
novels  to help rescue the one
creature upon whom the fate of 
Xanth hinges: Che, the winged 
centaur foal of Chex and Cheiron, 
both winged centaurs (half-human, half-horse, with wings). 
Apparently, the subject of an 
ominous prophecy was foalnapped by a horde of goblins.
Immediately, Chex, Ches 
mother, begins to gather a rescue 
party of a familiar bunch ofXanth 
characters, such as Ivy, Murphy, 
Grey, Grundy, and an exasperat
ing number of others. This soon 
leads to a great build-up oftension 
as a great war develops between 
the wingedbeasts and their allies, 
and the goblins and their allies, 
causing a world war of Xanth 
proportions.
On the other side of the story is 
the foal in question, Che, along 
with his newly found and equally 
captive companion, Jenny the elf. 
Like Dolph, Che is faced with a 
difficult decision. The choice will 
either cost him his freedom, or a
sweet young goblin girl her life.
Indeed there seem to be a lot of 
tough decisions throughout the 
novel; perhaps the writer in An
thony was trying to come through 
by establishing some correlation 
between the characters and their 
problems. But what came out 
more was Anthony the bookseller.
His attempt to rouse the 
readers interest by saturatingthe 
novel with a number of the series 
characters only diluted the story
line with a painfully great num
ber of introductions and explana
tions. Anthony probably could 
have shaved off fifteen pages just 
in introductions between the 
characters alone.
Another ploy was the imple
mentation of war in the novel. 
This battle, for lack of a better 
word, doesnt stand up to the 
greatly entertaining scenes that 
took place in Anthonys earlier 
novels, Castle Roogna and Night 
Mare. It seems that the book fails
courtesy Avon Books
to live up to the vigor of the Xanth 
of old. There were some new puns 
which the Xanth novels are noto
rious for, but they just didnt seem 
as punny as they once were.
Two refreshing characters to 
the slightly stale Xanth scenes 
were D. Metria and Sammy the 
Cat. Anthony still has a way with 
demons; and D. Metrias constant 
mischievous teasing of Dolph 
about the Adult Conspiracy 
(panties, summoning the stork, 
nasty words and gestures; infor
mation that the adults keep from 
their children) did ease the mo
notony of the story. Sammy was 
refreshing probably because he 
had the least to say out of anyone 
in the whole novel. He was fascinatinginhis actions, nonetheless.
Perhaps in number fourteen, 
Anthony, as brilliant as he is (or, 
rather, as he could be) will bring 
something refreshing to Xanth, 
instead of relying on cheapthrilling all-star casts, pseudo
wars, and corny stork-summoning 
scenes.
I would tell you about that scene, 
but Id be betraying the Adult 
Conspiracy.Dancers challenge the genre
By ALLISON DURAZZI
Tartan Assistant Features Editor
; More than twenty years ago, David 
Gordon and some of his contemporaries 
decided to change the worlds concept of 
dance, and they havent lookedback since. 
Gordons style, called post-modern dance, 
revolved at the Judson Memorial Church 
in\New York City, from improvisational 
performances that challenged the world 
of dance.
The works he and others created had 
slow movement. Dancers were even 
encouraged to do what dancers never do: 
speak and sing.
Many of the choreographers in this 
genre prefer to work alone instead of 
with a company. Gordon, however, has 
continued to keep his choreographic 
-freedom as well as manage a company. 
His pick up company reflects his use of 
the dancers  to be able to pick and 
choose the dancers he needs for each 
number and season. One of these danc
ers is Dean Moss.
Moss, whose role is actually a combi
nation of two roles, comes from a back
ground uncharacteristic of dancers. He 
started dancing at the late age of twentyone, primarily in jazz and ballet. He 
eventually received scholarships to study, 
including one to the Ballet School of 
Harlem in New York City.
Even after all this professional train
ing in classic dance, Moss said, One of
my hobbies is swing dancing to old jazz 
music. Dances like the fox trot, waltzes. 
And I also like the latin dances like 
mambo.
Before he joined the Pick Up Company, 
Moss described his dancing as show 
dancing. He danced in plays  West 
Side Story, for example, which toured in 
Paris. After his last show dancing job, 
Moss decided that he wanted to do 
something more creative. He craved the 
creativity that was offered him. In show 
dancing, he said, youre dancing in 
someone elses shoes.
Enter David Gordon.
One day in 1983, Moss recounts, A 
woman I was dating at the time said, 
Why dont you go out for David Gordons 
company? I said, Who? She said, David 
Gordon  he does interesting work and 
youre tall enough. I said, Okay. He 
didnt like me much because of my show 
dancing background. He was also hesi
tant because Im the first black in the 
company; what would that do to his mix? 
But he took that risk. Hes very human.
Unlike the plays Moss used to dance 
in, post-modern dance broke with all 
other forms in its lack of story-telling. In 
fact, Moss said, the first post-modernists 
made an agreement. Post-modern dance 
would have no manifesto, no theatrical
ity, and no virtuosity. They set the tone 
for the kind of dance that did not deal 
with the metaphysical.
But David Gordon himself has broken
with the original credo. His pieces do 
speak to some issues. In T.V. Reel, a 
mixture of video, dialogue, and music, 
the dancers explore the world of love and 
relationships. In another piece that will 
be performed here in Pittsburgh, 
Framework, the study of relationships 
is deepened.
Gordons theatricality was also the 
topic of one of his earlier pieces, Trying 
Times. In that piece, Gordon tried 
himself as if he were in court for not 
following the post-modern credo. How
ever, he has resolved that the theatri
cality has made his work accessible to all 
audiences. His work, Moss said, focuses 
on things everyone has gone through.
Moss will be in Framework in his 
combination role. Originally, he said, 
the role was created for Valda 
Setterfield. When Moss took over the 
role, it was fused with a role danced by 
Gordon. Now neither is in the show. I 
have aspects ofboth parts, mostly Valdas, 
but in the end I become Davids charac
ter. There is very little change in the 
script regarding this change; however, 
Moss is given great latitude with his 
interpretation of the part.
Relationships are a point Gordon em
phasizes. The Pick Up Company, Moss 
said, does a lot of physical partnering 
and manipulation. [Gordon] is very in
terested in the social dances and the 
comfort and interaction found in them. 
[Hel likes complex interaction ... on

stage.
This sought-after interaction is fos
tered by Gordon. When speaking of his 
first involvement with the Pick Up 
Company, Moss said that the three new 
members of the company and the five old 
members spent five weeks in a house in 
Lake Placid. The tension created when 
eight people who dont know each other 
well live together has been explored in a

background. Another piece, Moss said, 
created from their time in Lake Placid, 
Scripted, also deals with trying to live 
and work together and how they impact 
on each other.
Gordon has used his talent for innova
tion to create humorously serious pieces 
for the world of dance and for the world. 
And his work is definitely something for

HEIGHTS, from page L13
bolting his door and making a 
deafening clatter each night, then 
driving away the other tenants 
with  bleah  roaches. And 
when the justifiably incensed 
Drake takes countermeasures, 
Hayes turns the law against him, 
cleverly wielding every clause, 
insinuating himself through ev
ery loophole, and expertly fram
ing the victim as the victimizer.
Worse still is his devastating 
skill. When the police arrive, he is 
the soul of calm apology, while 
the infuriated Drake seems like a 
crazed maniac. Pretty soon, Hayes 
is a legally-endorsed parasite, 
undermining the structure of the 
couples life as he does their 
building.
Hayes is more than a criminal 
 hes an artist. Hes a grownup 
version of the cunning jerk from 
your childhood who could make 
superficially endearing remarks 
in front of adults while lacing 
them with sarcasm only percep
tible to you. His predatory 
dispassion is sometimes so great 
that you just want to see him grab 
Melanie Griffith by the lapels and 
hiss, Im Batmananything to 
evoke a sign of unholy enjoyment
that would show some trace of 
humanity, however psychotic. 
Iago would be proud.
Like a malignant disease, Hayes 
finally runs his course, and with 
the help of a sympathetic attor
ney, Drake and Patty manage to 
evict him and expel him from their 
lives. Had the movie ended there, 
it would be a conventional, drain
ing psychological drama. But 
Patty decides to follow Hayes trail 
and understand her tormentor. 
In this she succeeds, and the re
sulting all-out battle switches the 
audiences secretions from tears 
to adrenaline.
Its really a good movie, one in 
which you can feel at home with 
the characters (despite the few 
obligatory scenes wherein the 
heroine descends unaccompanied 
into a dark basement) and feel 
like cheering when they surmount 
their problems.

The Lenny Bruce 
Performance Film
If you only see one film for the rest of your life, 
make this it. Lenny Bruce was a controversial stand 
up comedian in the 1950s who became very well 
known for his lewd subject matter and equally offen
sive language. In matter of fact, he was tried in court 
several times for his obscenity, and late in his career, 
he began incorporating the trial transcripts into his 
act. Often Bruce was tried for his use of the word 
fuck, but later he used religion and antagonistic 
politics, not always to crowd-pleasing result.
By todays standards Lenny Bruce might seem a 
little tame. However, Bruce still holds his own against 
the Diceman and George Carlin, not because of his 
filthy mouth, but rather his sharp tongue.

Bambi
Lets face it... we still like milk and cookies, water 
balloons and the Smurfs on Saturdays. So how can 
we resist the tail of a deer and his best buddy 
Thumper the rabbit?
Bambi is having a rough time growing up (a 
dilemma for all species). His mom wont let him roam 
the forest anymore. Hunting season has arrived once 
more and Bambis mother wishes to protect her son 
from the shotguns of the evil men. Bambi, distressed 
that he cannot jump over logs with Thumper anymore, 
finds himself a love interest. He romps around the 
forest with his lovely fawn. Overcome with emotion 
for his first crush, Bambi even comes to terms with 
the antlers growing out of his forehead (they dont 
have Clearasil for antlers).
Walt Disney manages to catch the interest of all 
generation in this heartwarming animated film  
-including mature college students. So if you miss 
"the Smurfs this week never fearBambi is here to 
satisfy the kid in you.

The World According to Garp
An odd and at times disturbing movie, The World 
According to Garp is still a great movie in its own 
right. The story follows the life of Garp (Robin Wil
liams), an accident-prone man constantly overshad
owed by his mother (Glenn Close), an eccentric nurse 
who is a cross between a saint and a nuisance. These 
two characters help set the stage of a world where 
strange people do strange things while pretending to 
be sane. Planes crash into houses, people get assas
sinated, people die in automobile mishaps  its all 
part of Garps daily routine.
The acting is top-notch with an all-star cast: Wil
liams, Close, John Lithgow (as a transsexual football 
player), Jessica Tandy, Swoozie Kurtz, and Amanda 
Plummer. You might leave DH 2210 with the ques
tion, what the hell was that all about? butits worth

acting.

Jaws
Besides being a great horror film, Jaws has the only 
musical score a novice can play (press on the two 
lowest keys on the piano  the lowest key first). The 
story, in case you dont know by now, centers around 
a series of attacks on swimmers by a great white 
shark, the response of the threatened resort island to 
its loss of tourist business, and, finally, the epic 
attempt by three men to track the shark and kill it. 
There are a lot of different aspects which make this 
such a good film: the masterful directing of a young 
Steven Spielberg, John Williams eerie music which 
won him an Oscar, and the three main characters, 
Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss, and Robert Shaw, 
who give this movie its life and soul.
One word of advice: Dont go swimming after 
seeing the picture. It has been proven that one is 
more likely to feel a sharks presence in the water.
