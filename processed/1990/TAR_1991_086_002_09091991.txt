Walter Cathie has an image 
problem. As associate 
vice president for financial re
sources, Cathie knows that 
many students place the Office 
of Financial Aid on a level about 
even with the Internal Revenue 
Service. Wedrivealotofpeople 
through a funnel, ask for a lot of 
pieces of paper, and then we
take those pieces of paper and 
scrutinize the hell out of them, 
he says.
But Cathie says the amount of 
paperwork completed by stu
dents and their parents each 
year has nowhere to go but up as 
part of a new get-tough policy on 
grant money that he knows isnt 
going to win his office any popu
larity contests  especially 
among those who try to fudge 
the numbers.

Associate Vice President of 
Financial Resources Walter Cathie
The problem is fraud, and in 
February of last year, Cathie 
and Vice President for Enroll
ment Bill Elliot decided enough 
was enough. We decided to do
administratively what very few 
schools are doing, said Cathie. 
We decided to go very aggres
sively after fraud and abuse. 
Eighteen months later, he says
its clear that roughly 10 percent 
ofthe applications students and 
their families submit each year 
contain intentionally bogus in
formation.
The impetus for the new crack
down, according to Cathie, is a 
disparity between available aid 
and student need which has been 
increasing for some time. Pa
rental income, he says, has not 
kept pace with tuition and room/ 
board increases in recent years.
What you have is costs going up 
about $1500, mom and dads 
ability to pay going up about 
$400, so you have a raw finan
cial need of about eleven hun
dred bucks, he says. We dont 
have eleven hundred more free 
dollars to cover it. Thats the 
problem. This has been happen
ing for a long time, gradually.

Carnegie Mellon Dining Service has 
changed many facets of its operation 
this semester. Some of these include 
menu changes, restaurant restruc
turing, material alterations, and meal 
contract changes.
According to Roger Heydt, the as
sociate director of Dining Service, and 
Greg Smith, unit manager for Kiltie 
Court, the first new development con
cerns nutritional information. Starting this year, entrees served at the 
Highlander Cafe will have their nu
tritional statistics posted at the en
trance to the cafe in easy view to 
inform concerned students. High
lander will also offer chilled, filtered 
water to its patrons.
Menu changes at Kiltie Court in
clude the addition of a grilled chicken 
sandwich at the Tartan Grill, and 
the addition of over twenty new veg
etarian entrees at Salads Plus. The 
vegetarians that come through here 
are ecstatic, said Smith. Other
planned additions include Crystal 
Light at Salads Plus, a steak sand
wich at the Tartan Grill, and vari
ous types of bottled water at both 
parts of Kiltie Court.
The addition of a Dining Servicesanctioned Chinese food cart to the 
second floor of Wean Hall is another 
significant change. Last year an 
unsanctioned vendor sold Chinese 
meals on the first floor of Wean 
Hall. However, despite its popular
ity, the problems with his selling of 
food were threefold: first, it was
illegal; second, it violated the 
Universitys policy against solici
tation; and third, it was unsanitary. 
According to Heydt, the food was 
served cold and customers ran the 
risk of foodcontam: nation. If people 
had become sick, the University 
would have had no legal protec
tion.
The health risk was one of the 
major reasons why Dining Service 
wanted to assimilate the service, 
said Heydt. We do a lot of things

Groundbreaking plans are set for 
the Pittsburgh technology Center, 
with completion of construction 
planned for 1993 and occupation 
planned for early 1994. Plans for the 
center have been brewing in the minds 
of CMU and Pitt administrators,
Pittsburgh research marketers, and 
city planners since the mid-80s.
Originally viewed as a competition 
for state funding between Carnegie 
Mellon University and the Univer
sity of Pittsburgh, the research cen
ter is now a joint effort. The two 
universities each received $17 mil
lion grants from the state, an amount 
which the universities must contrib
ute towards building expenses.
The technological park will be lo
cated on Second Avenue, formerly a 
part of the Jones & Laughlin Steel 
Mill. The project encompasses a to
tal of 49 acres and hopes to attract 
both international and domestic 
companies. Access to the center will 
be limited to private enterprise al
though both colleges foresee coop
erative work in conjunction with 
the participating industries. Ac
cording to Maggie McCormick of 
Public and Community Relations, 
the new center will create jobs and 
stimulate the economy. It is an 
economic development to attract 
industry. It is also a major way the 
University can be partners with

Over the past three years, CMUs disciplinary 
guidelines and policy against sexual harassment 
have been reassessed and expanded. The revised 
policy now includes a list of representatives from 
campus groups and University departments who 
comprise a panel of advisors. A member of the Panel 
of Sexual Harassment Advisors is able to provide 
information to anyone who feels that he or she has 
been sexually harassed.
While this panel was being developed, another 
team of advisors was in the works  the Sexual 
Assault Advisory Group. Both groups provide gen
eral information as well as counseling. The exist
ence of these groups ensures that victims of sexual 
harassment, assault or rape have a wide range of 
people who are available to talk, whether it be about 
personal concerns or information concerning legal 
action.
As the names of the groups imply, they focus on 
different concerns. But there are more differences 
between the groups respective purposes than the 
definitions of the terms harassment and assault * 
Amy Ginther, assistant director of housing, said 
that the membership of the Assault Advisory Group 
is a larger, broader mix than the Sexual Harass
ment panel. Most of the advisors listed on the panel 
are from the Universitys administration, with rep
resentatives coming from Faculty Senate, Staff 
Council, Student Senate, and the Graduate Student 
Organization (GSO); so far, the assault advisory 
group includes representatives from Health Ser
vices, the Counseling Center, Housing, Campus 
Police, and other groups.
Dean of Student Affairs Michael Murphy is one of 
the advisors on the Sexual Assault Advisory Group. 
He describes the group as a continuing education 
program. The advisors would be a source of informa
tion for any man or woman on campus with ques
tions about sexual assault [and] what constitutes 
sexual assault.
The group has one undergraduate student mem
ber, who wishes to remain anonymous. The student 
has been involved with the advisory group since the 
early stages of its development. I had gone to speak 
with Dean Murphy about the lack of a support 
system for survivors of sexual assault, she said. 
She and Murphy kept in contact, and when the 
advisory group was formed, she became a member. 
I think its important for a student to be on it, she 
said. Now students can receive counseling and in
formation from another student, something which 
might put a victim of sexual assault at ease.
She feels that many people at CMU dont know 
what services are available to them through the

A Hunt Library exhibit calls 
attention to over a dozen works 
of literature and photography 
that have been recently cen
sored. The materials showcased 
range from a photograph of ani
mal testing procedures being 
done at CMU to a copy of Little 
Red Riding Hood which was 
banned in Texas because of the 
violent wolf and the wine in 
Riding Hoods basket.
David Stanley assembled the 
exhibit as a final project for his 
masters degree in library sci
ence from the University of Pitts
burgh. The items in the display, 
which were donated by CMU 
processors, students and employ
ees, were banned because of their 
supposedly immoral values, 
said Stanley. Especially in an 
academic environment, people 
need to be aware that this does 
go on.
One item in the display is a 
dictionary which was banned by 
an Anchorage, Alaska, school 
board in 1987. The board de
cided to censor the dictionary 
because of its definition of bed 
as a verb and its definitions of 
the words knocker, balls, and 
nuts.
A more local item in the ex
hibit is a photograph of a mem
ber of the CMU community per
forming experiments on a small 
animal. The photograph was 
removed from a CMU annual 
report in fear of Inflaming any
animal rights activists. The do
nor of the photograph, who 
wished to remain anonymous, 
said, Its OK to experiment on 
animals; you just cant tell any
body about it. Dont use my name 
in connection with the display. 
This is called self-censorship for 
self-preservation.
Associate Head of Drama Don 
Marinelli feels that censorship 
has had damaging effects on 
drama in todays society. He be
lieves that many theater direc
tors decide what to show based 
on how much money they will 
make, not artistic consider
ations. More censorship goes 
on very subtly via peoples pocketbooks, he said. Thats prob
ably resulted in more selfPlease see CENSORSHIP, page 5

Unemployment 
statistics aid 
new legislation
WASHINGTON (DJ, September 
6)  Democratic leaders in.Con
gress said Augusts weak unemploy
ment figures provide impetus for 
action on legislation that would pro
vide extended benefits to jobless 
workers who have exhausted their 
state aid.
The Labor Department reported 
Friday that the unemployment rate 
was unchanged in August at 6.8 
percent, near where it has hovered 
since March.
The department said employment 
gains were made in some sectors of 
the manufacturing and service in
dustries, and that the factory work
week increased,' but that the overall 
picture showed little improvement.
Sen. Paul Sarbanes (D-Maryland), 
chairman of the Joint Economic 
Committee,* said Congress will be
gin work next week on legislation 
that would draw down the 
governments $8 billion unemploy
ment benefits trust fund.
Those of us in Congress who have 
fought for extending benefits to the 
unemployed are not prepared to drop 
the issue, said Sarbanes.
Before Congress adjourned for the 
August recess lawmakers approved 
an extended aid bill. President Bush 
signed the legislation into law, but 
refused to designate the measure an 
emergency  effectively blocking 
access to the trust fund.
Sarbanes said the new legislation 
would not give Bush the choice of 
designating the bill an emergency, 
meaning he will have to make the 
more politically difficult choice of 
whether to reject the bill outright 
with a \veto.
Echoing Democratic sentiment, 
Senate Budget Chairman James 
Sasser (D-Tennessee) accused Bush 
of being more interested in foreign 
policy than domestic concerns. He 
noted that Congress, at Bushs re
quest, has approved emergency leg
islation for Turkey, the Kurds, and 
Bangladesh.
Im not questioning the 
administrations decisions in those 
areas, Sasser said. But somehow, 
the charity seems to stop here at 
home.
"Somehow, everytime we start to 
see the depth of the human tragedy 
thats being experienced here in 
America, the president gets a sud
den attack of fiscal responsibility.

MOSCOW (AP, September 6)  
Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin, 
lifelong Communists who presided over 
the Partys removal from power, told 
American television viewers early Fri
day morning that the Communist sys
tem had failed their country.
The Soviet and Russian presidents 
sat beside each other in the Kremlins 
glittering St. Georges Hall. They an
swered questions live on ABC televi
sion from viewers around the United 
States. The show was also broadcast in 
the Soviet Union.
The men addressed the fate of their 
nations nuclear arsenal, their stormy 
personal relationship, and promised dis
sidents that they could return safely.
One oftheirmore dramatic responses 
was to a question by Los Angeles actor 
Ben Stein, who asked whether the two 
leaders believed any country should
live under communism.
Yeltsin answered first: This experi
ment which was conducted on our soil 
was a tragedy for our people, and it was 
too bad that it happened on our terri
tory. It would have been better if the 
experiment had happened in some small 
country, to make it clear that it was a 
utopian idea, although a beautiful idea. 
Gorbachev said history has shown 
that that model has failed which was 
brought about in our country. And I 
believe that this is a lesson not only for 
our people but for all peoples. 
Thursday, Gorbachev and Yeltsin 
worked together to gain approval of an 
interim government for the Soviet 
Union and a program to create a new 
confederation of sovereign states.
The new system would end more than 
70 years of Kremlin rule under the 
Communist Party and reorganize the
Soviet government to give many pow
ers to Soviet republics.
The political upheaval followed an 
August 18-21 coup attempt by Com
munist hard-liners who tried to oust 
Gorbachev as Soviet president and end 
his reforms. The coup collapsed, its 
leaders were arrested and the party 
was pulled from power. Gorbachev and 
Yeltsin rose to prominence through the 
Communist Party, but Yeltsin resigned 
from the Party long before the coup 
attempt, and Gorbachev stepped down 
as Party leader afterward.
A questioner from Atlanta who iden
tified himself as Oleg Myshkin, a defec
tor who said he had had problems with 
the KGB, was assuredby Yeltsin, There 
is no more danger... please come back. 
Yeltsin said he had met with exiles 
recently and welcomed them home.
Peter Jennings, the ABC host, asked
the two men how they got along.
A good deal of water has passed 
through the bridge, Gorbachev said.
Yelstin said: There have been times 
when Gorbachev thought I was a politi
cal corpse .... But weve adjusted, and 
particularly after recent events, Presi
dent Gorbachev has changed very seri
ously.
From Miami, a Cuban exile asked 
whether the leaders foresaw the with
drawal of military hardware from his 
former land.
Yeltsin said, I think that the process 
has begun and must be continued. 
Gradually the troops must be removed."
Gorbachev, however, responded dif
ferently, saying that the two countries 
have mutually beneficial (relations) in 
an economic sense. I believe we dont 
intend to alter our relations in a differ
ent direction.
Secretary of State Baker plans visit to new Soviet leaders
WASHINGTON (AP, September 6)
 In an unprecedented move designed 
to discern where the Soviet Union is 
headed, Secretary of State James A. 
Baker III is arranging talks next week 
with the head of the Soviet KGB and 
the new Soviet defense minister.
Baker also will go to Leningrad to 
meet with Mayor Anatoly Sobchak and 
make a stop in Kazakhstan, the oilrich, second-largest Soviet republic, 
where he will hold talks with its presi
dent, Nursultan Nazarbayev.
The trip, which begins Tuesday, af
fords Baker a chance to make a first: 
hand assessment of the rapid political 
changes as the Soviet Union moves 
away from orthodox communism and a 
strong central government.
As reported, Baker also is going to 
Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, the 
three newly independent Baltic states 
whose separation from the Soviet Union 
has helped encourage other republics
to assert their identity. .
He wants to meet with-as many 
Soviet reformers as he can and to en
gage with these individuals, Margaret
D. Tutwiler, the State Department 
spokesperson, said in announcing 
Bakers travel plans. And thats what 
he is going to do.
If a meeting with KGB chief Vadim 
Bakatin is arranged, it would be the 
first between a senior U.S. official and 
the head of the Soviet secret police.
Also, the session he has requested 
with Defense Minister Yevgeny 
Shaposhniskov would be Bakers first 
with a Soviet defense minister in Mos
cow.
Baker had met in Washington with 
Dmitri Yazov, the former defense min
ister, who was one of the key members 
of the coup that plotted the overthrow 
of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev last 
month.
$10B Israeli loan may be postponed
WASHINGTON (AP, September 6)
 President Bush urged Congress to 
postpone action for four months on $10 
billion in loan guarantees for Israel, 
saying the debate could derail a Middle 
East peace conference.
Israels Prime Minister Shamir said 
he expects to receive $10 billion in U.S. 
loan guarantees for settling Soviet 
Jews, and insisted Israel would con
tinue moving people to the occupied 
lands, a policy Washington opposes.
Shamirs statement was the latest 
from Israeli officials pushing for the 
loan guarantees.
Israeli diplomats were expected to 
formally request them at a meeting 
last week in Washington with Secre
tary of State Baker.
I think there is in the American 
society, and throughout the adminis
tration, a complete recognition that 
the United States must give this aid to 
the great undertaking of Soviet immi
gration, Shamir said in a radio broadcast to mark the Jewish new year.
Bush indicated clear displeasure 
with Prime Minister Shamirs deter
mination to go ahead with the formal 
aid request anyway.
We dont need an acrimonious 
debate just as were about to get this 
peace conference convened, Bush 
told reporters during a White House 
meeting with Secretary of State 
James A. Baker III.
Several important Democrats, in-, 
eluding Senator Patrick Leahy of 
Vermont, who.heads a subcommit
tee that handles foreign aid, had 
signaled in advance their support for 
such a delay.
The Bush administration is trying 
to maneuver Israel and Arab states 
into peace talks starting in October. 
Bush said the process could be un
dermined by a debate on proposed 
housing loan guarantees to help Is
rael deal with the influx of Soviet 
Jewish emigrees.
Mandela rejects de Klerks latest proposal
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa 
(AP, September 6)  Nelson Mandela 
rej ected the go vemingNational Partys 
proposed constitution as a ploy to pre
vent the transfer of power to the black 
majority.
The AfricanNational Congress leader 
reiterated his groups call for an in
terim government to run the country 
while a new constitution was negoti
ated.
Under the plan approved by a federal 
congress of President F.W. de Klerks 
National -Party, the 30 million black 
majority would take part in national 
elections for the first time in South 
African history.
Under the proposed constitution, a 
collective presidency representing the 
strongest parties would lead the coun
try, while a two-chamber parliament 
would approve legislation. One cham
ber would be elected democratically, 
with each party winning the same per
centage of seats as votes received. The 
other chamber would have equal repre
sentation from nine districts, guaran
teeing a voice for "minority groups.
The African National Congress and 
other anti-apartheid groups have ac
cused the National Party proposal of 
giving minority groups, including the 
traditionally dominant 5-million white 
minority, power to prevent change by 
the black majority.
De Klerk has called for multiparty 
negotiations on a new constitution and 
offered the National Party proposal as 
a framework for talks. He has rejected 
African National Congress calls for an 
interim government during negotia
tions, saying it would create a leader
ship vacuum.
Mandela said Friday an interim gov
ernment would put all negotiating par
ties on equal footing and create the 
proper climate for talks.

here to insure the wholesome
ness of the food: temperature 
checks before and during all the 
meal periods, taste tests before 
all the meals, and we regularly 
check all our refrigerators and 
holding units and cooking de
vices to make sure they main
tain the food at sanitary and 
wholesome conditions.
A switch from paper cups and 
plates to recyclable polystyrene 
cups and plates is another pro
posed change by Dining Service. 
The decision is being made in 
conjunction with the engineer
ing and public policy project 
course, and, said Heydt, Id say
were 99.5 percent sure were 
going to do it.
Dining Service has already 
begun to recycle corrugated card
board at all its restaurants. The 
paper currently used in cups and 
plates is neither recyclable nor 
biodegradable, and the only op
tion besides placingit into a land
fill is to compost it  but 
composting is illegal in western 
Pennsylvania.
The proposed change, if insti
gated, will take place October 
15 and the polystyrene will be 
recycled for both economic and 
environmental concerns. As 
Heydt pointed out, its no easy 
change, as [Recycling of
polysterene] is highly irregular 
in western Pennsylvania."
The last of the major changes 
made this year by Dining Ser
vice is in contract meal allow
ances. The cash allowance per 
meal was increased while for 
the most part entree and meal 
prices stayed the same.
Prices are figured by Dining 
Service as a relation between 
costs and the expectations of the 
members of the community. Din
ing Service attempts to keep 
prices as stable as possible, but, 
as in the case of peanut butter in 
last years peanut crop freeze, is 
sometimes forced to raise prices 
to meet costs.

with the University of Pitts

Carnegie Mellon fights financial aid fraud
FINANCIAL AID, from page 1
aid given out, despite cuts in 
federal funds. The government 
has an abysmal track record for 
higher education, he says. We 
have fewer grant dollars now 
from the federal government 
than we had in 1979. For com
parison, he points to the fact 
that in 1979, the University gave 
out $1,586,000 in student aid, or 
10 percent of tuition income; last 
year, the figure was $11 million, 
which is about a 19 percent re
turn of tuition dollars, and 
Cathie says CMU will give out 
$12,785,000 this year, for a 
record of approximately 20 per
cent of tuition income.
Now if you divide that by, 
lets say about 2,600 kids who 
have a need, youre going to come 
up with about $650. Thats the 
average amount of free money 
thats increased. Thats a long 
way from the over $1000 [per 
student] that we need.... Whats 
happening is the financial needs 
of our students are going up 
faster than the sources to meet 
the need.
The problem of fraud, then, 
only aggravates this need. One 
of the most common attempts at 
beating the system is through 
the tax rolls. In these instances, 
Cathie says, the tax return we

Be sure to report all your income to 1RS. It receives copies of statements from your employer, banks, and similar institutions to verify the income you report.
[the required information] is on 
the front page of the 1040, as far 
as income, said Cathie. If you 
understand tax law, and can take 
advantage of it, you can beat the 
system.
Currently, the government 
conducts random computer 
checks on about 30 percent of 
the students applying for aid on 
a national level. Cathie says 
that CMU will do the same with 
its aid recipients here  sifting 
through the other 70 percent in 
the process.
Well get everyone before 
theyre a senior, he says. Some
time during those four years 
Carnegie Mellon will pay the fee 
and go get the real tax return to 
see if it mates up. If its phony, 
theres a real problem.
Even if the forms match, how
ever, Cathie says the numbers 
often dont stand up to the test of 
basic math. If youve got $2500 
in interest dividends in your tax 
returns, I go in and say, at 8 
percent you have about $31,250 
in the bank, he says. Now if 
you report $10,000, then Ive got 
to know the trick how you have 
$10,000 in the bank and you can 
get $2500 in interest dividends, 
because I gotta use the same 
investment firm!
Even in the midst of glaring 
inconsistencies, however, Cathie 
says that discretion is still the 
better part of valor in what he 
calls a very labor intensive 
process that is more of an art 
than a science. It can be legiti
mate. You may have taken out 
$21,000 to buy a new car, or to
We'll get everyone before theyre a 
senior. 
Associate Vice President of 
Financial Resources Walter Cathie
put a roof on your house, or pay 
legal expenses. So you have a lot 
of anecdotal information.A com
mon source of red flags, he says, 
are simply honest mistakes. 
There are people who dont in
tentionally cheat, but still dont 
give the right answers, because 
the form is a pain to fill out. I 
know it is.
Often, however, the case is 
more cut and dry. A trick unique 
to local students is securing aid 
based on the expectation of their 
living on campus, and then com
muting to school from home.
Cathie also says that some 39 
percent of students on aid (about 
1000 students) list another fam
ily member in college. But by 
subsequent checking in coopera
tion with other schools, he says 
they have determined that some
where between 12 and 19 per
cent of these alleged siblings turn 
out not to be enrolled.
Fake parental divorces are yet 
another example of abuse of the 
system. Knowing the financial 
gains of listing a single income, 
parents have lied about their 
marital status, said Cathie, add
ing that all it took to expose 
these cases was to request a copy 
of the divorce settlement. If they
get divorced, then the federal 
government only counts the in
come with whom the student is 
residing. Typically its Mom. So 
you get aid based on Moms in
come and Dad could be a mil
lionaire.
Another way many students 
show lesser means on their aid 
applications is by claiming inde
pendent status. While Cathie 
says such declarations are some
times valid (such as in the case, 
of non-traditional students) he 
says abuse is the rule, rather 
than the exception, citing ex
amples of students living in ex
pensive off-campus apartments 
with no visible means of sup
port.
Because of this, Cathie says 
CMU is forced to take the hard 
line: You can fill out all the 
forms, and the government will 
accept you as independent, but 
Carnegie Mellon wont for pur
poses of our money, he says. 
Were not going to allow it to 
happen. Because the basic te
net that an independent school 
has to use is, were going by 
Mom and Dads ability to pay, 
not their willingness ... well 
work with you, but youre not 
going to get additional grant
dollars over the next student 
because your parents dont want 
to pay, while their parents are 
struggling.
Cathie believes this practice 
is especially widespread, citing 
government figures that list 60 
percent of federal aid recipients 
as financially independent. 
Now you look out there. Do we 
have 60 percent of the students 
going to college who are inde
pendent? Gimme a break, no way 
... Somethings the matter.
One of the most frustrating 
facets of the problem of fraud is 
that in many cases it is com
pletely legal. As an example, 
Cathie cited a case several years 
ago where the son of a wealthy 
businessman received federal 
funds because the government 
declared he was disadvantaged.
The reason is that the 
students fathers tax forms in
dicated what is called a net op
erating loss carry-forward, 
wherein he was able to claim 
plummeting company stock 
holdings against his six-figure 
income. The result was that the 
student received a $2300 Pell 
Grant, as well as a low-interest 
Stafford Loan of $4000.
That was an affront to me 
that that young man would get a 
Pell Grant every year, said 
Cathie. But in addition to these 
same federal funds, the students 
brother  who went to a public 
university also received work 
study and a Supplementary 
Educational Opportunity Grant 
from his school.
When it was suggested that
CMU follow suit,. Cathie says 
thats where the giving stopped. 
We said bullshit... this kid was' 
living in $650,000 home. Thats' 
not your average pea patch. No\v 
if hes going to come in here and 
say {I got this piece of paper from 
the federal government saying 
Im disadvantaged, then Im' 
gonna say, Hey pal, theres the 
door. Youre less disadvantaged 
than Dick Cyert.
Cathie doesnt deny the crack
down on abuse has, and will 
continue, to cost the university 
some students. In cases where 
fraud is determined, CMU will 
demand full repayment of all 
funds granted under false pre
tenses. This, he concedes, is of
ten enough to pull the student 
out of school, and is the main 
reason other schools wont 
bother.
Theyre unwilling to go after 
cases of fraud, because they dont 
want to lose a paying customer: 
They say, Why would we cut 
that students aid? Theyre bring
ing in $15,000 in tuition, and 
were giving out $5000 in aid. At 
least were making $10,000 on 
the margin. If we play hardball, 
that kidll go to XYZ Stateand 
we already have empty dormito-i 
ries ... Thats real world ecoj 
nomics, says Cathie.
The hard-line approach, then, 
is something Cathie sees as a 
positive trait that CMU shares 
with very few schools. Our phi
losophy is that youre getting 
more bang for the buck by deliv
ering it into the hands of the 
kids who really need it.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  9 September 19915
Sexual harassment groups formed
SEXUAL HARASSMENT, from page 1
university. Theres a lack of 
knowledge in the CMU commu
nity about what a survivor can 
do, she said. Although she 
doesnt allow her name to be 
listed along with the other group 
members, she can be reached 
via the student counseling cen
ter. Students simply ask to be 
referred to the student sexual 
assault advisor. They dont have 
to say their name, or why theyve 
called, she said. They dont 
have to divulge anything to any
one but me.
The members of the Sexual 
Assault Advisory Group have 
had three training sessions on 
counseling since this spring, on 
the general, medical, and disci
plinary issues involved in what 
Murphy describes as sensitive 
crime training. The members 
of the Sexual Assault Advisory 
Group, like Ginther and Coun
seling Director Lorrie Rabin, 
have had some training and/or 
experience in counseling.
[The advisors] are trained and 
ready to assist students, said
Rabin. Both she and Ginther 
stressed that each situation is 
unique, and in Ginthers words, 
that no action would be taken 
without the students clear, in
formed decision.
Rabin further described the 
purpose of the group, stating 
that the advisors exist to be 
supportive in times of crisis. 
Many times, students dont know 
where to go. [In the past,] there 
was no one entity that identified 
itself as responding to that prob
lem. This is the Universitys way 
of responding to that need. 
Linda Binstock, the director 
of Legal Affairs, is one of the 
advisors to whom a student or 
university employee would go. 
Binstock finds it slightly discon
certing that not many people 
have come to her. Ive been des
ignated to receive complaints for 
a number of years, and Ive had 
very few people who have con
sulted me ... I hear these float
ing rumors, and no one comes 
forward. Theres nothing I can 
do about it if no one comes for
ward ... If theyre scared to, we
could even talk about that.
According to Associate Provost 
for Academic Projects Barbara 
Lazarus, the panel is a collec
tion of trained individuals who 
dont necessarily act as a team. 
We only come together with the 
permission of the student, said 
Lazarus. [We] have a responsi
bility to make sure that the stu
dent remains anonymous. The 
panel existed in the old sexual 
harassment policy as a threeperson group; with the recent 
revision came additions to the 
panel and a reassessment of who 
should be represented in the 
advisory panel.
The GSO is one of the campus 
organizations with a member on 
the Panel of Sexual Harass
ment Advisors. David Park, a 
graduate student in the Social 
and Decision Sciences Depart
ment, is the GSOs representa
tive on the panel. He said that 
he volunteered because he feels 
that sexual harassment is an 
important issue.

know what sexual harassment

is, said Park. A little while 
ago, I saw a woman reading a 
book  a Gothic romance, as it 
turned out. I asked to see it, 
since she really seemed to be 
into it. The scene she was read
ing was a rape. The language 
was pretty, but the violence was 
apparent, at least to me. She 
didnt realize it was arape. When 
I told her how the scene read to 
me, she seemed to think I was 
weird. Park hasnt been trained 
as an advigor yet, but he said 
that he hoped that he would be 
able to stimulate proactive edu
cation, and make people aware 
of the ramifications of the situa
tions and events around them.
These groups will allow any 
member of the campus commu
nity  students, university em
ployees  to address the per
sonal; legal and even medical 
issues of sexual harassment and 
assault. Increased campus-wide
awareness of the options a per
son has following a sensitive 
crime should help in working 
toward a campus in which a vic
tim will never feel helpless.
Exhibit focuses on censorship
CENSORSHIP, from page 1
censorship than anything else. 
Marinelli recommended the play 
Ghost by Henrik Ibsen for in
clusion in the censorship exhibit, 
but feels that censorship is just 
as prevalent today.
One such example of recent 
censorship in drama that 
Marinelli pointed out is The 
Pope Must Die, a film which 
opened nationwide last Friday. 
Eachofthemajortelevisionnetworks, as well as some newspa
pers, have refused to run ads for 
the film because of its offensive 
title and content. Catholic 
groups and other citizen organi
zations have been protesting the 
movie. According to Marinelli, 
the producers of the satire had 
every right to give it a disturb
ing title, since they thought the 
reasons for doing it outweighed 
the reasons for good taste.
Another display item is Ma 
and God, from the book Where 
the Sidewalk Ends, by Shel
Silverstein. Andrew Specialist 
Esther Filderman, who donated 
the book to the exhibit, remem
bers that several groups pro
tested the poem. As long as 
this country has the very con
servative people who insist on 
telling people how to rule their 
lives, there will be book censor
ship, she said.
The exhibit also touches on 
more recent controversial is
sues such as flag burning and 
the AIDS epidemic. According 
to Robert Bates, a law student 
at the University of Pittsburgh 
and a contributor to the censor
ship display, The problem is 
with political correctness, try
ing to squash opinions that are 
not acceptable.
Censorship is not a thing of 
the past, but rather, according 
to Stanleys censorship exhibit, 
A Continuing Threat. The 
exhibit is on the ground floor of 
Hunt Library and will remain 
there for three more weeks.

FORUM
Oppose aid fraud
The Financial Aid office has 
begun to crack down on fraud. If 
students or parents lie on finan
cial aid applications, they will 
be caught through a newly in
stalled series of verification 
procedures.
We support this crack-down. 
Cheaters are technically and 
morally in the wrong, whether 
they are in a classroom situa
tion or applying for aid.
Through the new procedures, 
Financial Aid is attempting to 
level the playing field and help 
those applicants who honestly 
need the aid, while weeding out 
those who are just trying to avoid 
paying full tuition.
While this new verification 
procedure is an inconvenience 
right now, it is definitely ad
vantageous to those applicants 
who are not cheating and hon
estly need the aid.
The new process is also to the 
advantage of the entire campus 
community. The alternatives for 
recouping the money lost 
through financial aid fraud 
would be detrimental to the 
make-up of the student body as 
a whole. Some of these options:
CMU could admit fewer 
people who need University aid. 
It could recruit only in affluent 
areas or admit more students 
who are eligible for Pennsylva
nia state aid. This alternative 
would mean less heterogeneity 
within the student body and is 
not in the best interests of a 
university which prides itself 
on the wide variety of students 
it attracts, and the diversity of 
thought this encourages.
Financial Aid could cut 
around a hundred dollars off the 
top of each persons aid package. 
This policy would inevitably 
force some worthy students who 
are dependent on aid to go else
where for their education, and 
again eliminate a portion of stu
dents important to the diversity 
of Carnegie Mellon.
An admit/deny policy could 
be instated. Under this policy, 
people who are ranked aca
demically in the bottom per
centage of the applicant pool 
would be denied any form of aid, 
regardless of need. For example, 
if a student is accepted by Carn
egie Mellon through the con
ventional admissions process 
but needs aid, he or she could be 
denied aid based on his or her 
academic ranking as compared 
to the other students accepted. 
If the student must receive aid 
in order to attend CMU, he or 
she will be forced to go elsewhere. 
Meanwhile, a student with 
lesser credentials who can af
ford to pay is admitted. This 
policy is already in place at other 
institutions, but we feel that a 
Carnegie Mellon education is 
something that should be 
achieved on merit, not auctioned 
off to the highest bidder.
Another way for the situation to 
be corrected is for people to be 
honest on their aid applications. 
While this doesnt seem to be an 
unreasonable request, obviously 
some people have a problem with 
it. To those people: realize that 
you are cheating others who de
serve to be at Carnegie Mellon 
just as much as you do. These 
people are your classmates, your 
friends, maybe your roommate. 
Cheating on financial aid is a form 
of stealing. Think about it.
The Financial Aid Office has 
long been the target of much 
displeasure from the student 
body. This time, we feel that 
Financial Aid deserves credit for 
recognizing a problem and at
tempting to correct the situa
tion. We understand that the 
new policy means a lot more 
work for the already overtaxed 
staff, but it is necessary  and 
appreciated.

Last year students were an
gry at Carnegie Mellon Dining 
Service for a variety of reasons. 
People felt cheated by the meal 
plan system and there was a 
lack of variety. Students de
manded changes, and CMDS has 
responded. The changes are 
welcome and students should 
realize that'CMDS is working to 
improve the quality of food on 
campus.
Among the solutions CMDS 
has implemented is a higher al
lowance per meal at the a la 
carte dining facilities. Students 
now have extra buying power 
for each meal they eat. This 
change adds choices for students 
on meal plan while keeping them 
within the allowed limits.
In the past, the campus com
munity has patronized an 
unsanctioned Chinese food op
eration in the basement of Wean 
Hall. CMDS has recently taken 
the step of instituting a Chinese 
food cart of its own. The avail
ability of quality ethnic food 
improves the students choice. 
The idea might be expandable if 
Z\ a great enough demand is found.
Variety is in constant demand 
at campus dining outlets. In or
der to accommodate suggestions, 
the Tartan Grill and Highlander 
have introduced new items to

expand the selection.
Complaints surfaced last year 
about the traffic flow in High
lander. Several steps have been 
taken to change the movement 
of students in and around the 
counter areas.The flow of people 
is now channeled up the middle, 
where silverware tables help 
separate incoming people away 
from the lines at the food 
counter s. Students are directed 
to their respective lines without 
much confusion, a major im
provement over previous ar
rangements. Also,the cereal, 
milk, and deli section have been 
moved into the dining area on 
the first floor. This helps to 
eliminate long lines at counters 
and allows students to move 
through the facility in a more 
orderly fashion.
Dining Service has addressed 
some concerns about campus 
dining and hopes to improve 
service through these changes. 
Students should be encouraged 
to know that changes are being 
made to better serve them. The 
recent developments signal a 
willingness to meet the dining 
needs of CMU and students 
should appreciate that CMDS 
is making an effort to address 
the issues that have been 
brought forward.

Student voices concern 
about responsibility
Editor:
A responsible jour
nalist researches ar
ticles fully and reports Letter to 
findings in the most jll. zwtalew 
accurate way possible. EUllur
A good journalist does so in an interest
ing, and sometimes humorous, man
ner.
Something is wrong, however, when 
a journalist allows the desire to be 
funny to override responsibility to the 
truth. Staffwriter Andrew Cosentino 
overstepped this boundary. His last 
column [Is the world ready for the age 
of Geek Steroids?, 9/3] makes ridicu
lous claims about the possible dangers 
of serotin, a new chemical that has 
been shown to enhance memory in 
laboratory rats.
Cosentino asserts that this chemical 
will soon be made available to the pub
lic, and that those who use it will sud
denly start remembering eventsboth 
good and bad  that occurred during 
childhood.
He also argues that if the chemical 
reaches the black market, many stu
dents would seek it in hopes of enhanc
ing their memory power, and that their 
abuse of serotin would cause their fore
heads to swell to three or four times 
the size of Guy Smileys.
Unfortunately for Cosentino, his ar
gument lacks factual support and fails 
to draw a logical conclusion. Serotin is 
new, and will not be made available to 
the public unless its safety and side 
effects are extensively researched. It is 
also unlikely that serotin, which helps 
lab rats remember things they usually
quickly forget, would cause the recall of 
childhood events, which are stored deep 
in the subconscious.
Serotin would never survive on the 
black market  there arent enough 
nerds around to make it a profitable 
sale. As for the issue of swelled fore
heads, all that needs to be said is that 
serotin is a memory enhancer, not a 
growth hormone.
To be concerned about new drugs is 
understandable and even admirable. 
But to attempt to be humorous at the 
expense of accurate reporting is simply 
irresponsible.
If you want to be funny, criticize 
something you know about  like the 
birdshit-stained windows that Franklin 
Chang described. Dont base a humor
ous and damning criticism on a oneparagraph space-filler in USA Today 
Doing so only evidences your ignornce 
of the topic.
Serotin has the potential to be an 
extremely useful drug for the learning 
disabled, and for the countless others 
with memory dysfunctions. A respon
sible journalist, who fully researches 
and carefully presents his arguments, 
would have mentioned that.

Israel deserves help for 
aiding immigrants
Editor:
The state of Israel 
is currently growing 
at an amazing rate.
Thousands of new 
immigrants pour in
OS
Letter to 
the Editor
daily from the Soviet Union, 14,000
Ethiopian Jews were airlifted to Israel 
in May, and all of Albanias Jews have 
now moved to Israel. In all, as many a 
a million immigrants are expected 
within five years. Each new immigrant 
needs housing, work, schooling for the 
children, and medical care.
Unfortunately, Israels small 
economy is not equipped to provide all 
of these necessities at the moment. The 
government has had to ask for a ten 
billion dollar package of loans from 
United States banks to cover the costs 
of absorbing these new immigrants.
The U.S. government has been asked 
to guarantee these loans  meaning 
that they promise that the banks will 
be repaid even if Israel defaults  
allowing Israel to borrow the money for 
30 years instead of seven.
Both the cost and the risk are mini
mal. In 43 years, Israel has never de
faulted on a single bank loan. Assum
ing Israel remains true to form, the 
United States will accrue only minoi 
bookkeeping costs, and its banks will 
have made a sound investment of the 
kind they most need.
Some would like to see Congress link 
its approval of the guarantees to Israeli 
concessions on issues related to the 
peace process in the Middle East. To do 
so would put unfair pressure on Israel 
no such pressure has been applied ti
the Arab nations also involved in the 
peace process  at the expense of its 
newest citizens. Congress should leave 
the peace issues to be discussed at next 
months conference and approve the 
loan guarantee.

Last week The Tartan was dominated 
by reports of theft  from the Univer
sity, the dorms, and the fraternities. 
After three years, I am used to seeing 
blurbs on stolen items in the crime and 
incident reports.
Recently, however, the campus has 
become a wholesale supplier of music 
equipment, computers, jewelry and 
other personal items, and ID machines 
to an unknown person or group.
The Universitys stand is that the 
magnitude of the thefts is explainable 
mainly by the lack of people on campus 
during the summer. This is a danger
ous and misleading attitude. Over the 
1990-91 school year, large-scale thefts 
began to happen more frequently than 
any previous year. This past summer is 
only the latest strike.
To start off fall 1990, Kappa Sigma 
had its amplifier, turntables, and CD 
player stolen due to a broken back door. 
This occurred after two speakers had 
already been stolen and after three 
emergency requests to Physical Plant 
to repair the door.
Next, three more fraternity houses
Plumbers went to the Kappa Sigma house 
and when their key did not work in the new 
Rich Robinson lock for the back door, they removed the 
lock mechanism. Instead of replacing it... 
the mechanism was left out overnight...
had various items stolen-from records 
to music equipment. But the thieves 
did not only hit the quad. The Univer
sity had its ID machine stolen, as well 
as master keys. Obviously, it doesnt 
matter to the thieves if it is summer or 
not, nor if there are people around or 
not.
These incidents raise some impor
tant questions. Why? is easypeople 
steal for the money. How? is a bit 
tougher. For the fraternities, the big
gest problem is the lack of service they 
receive from Physical Plant and the 
University. House managers I have 
talked to tend to tell very similar sto
ries. First, they submit three emergency 
work orders, one each week. Then, they 
have to go to Housing to have Housing 
call Physical Plant. If the house man
ager gets lucky, the following week the 
broken door or window will be fixed. 
For a month, however, the house is 
open to anyone walking by at 4 am.
Recently, plumbers went to the Kappa
Sigma house to perform some maintentf 
and when the key that they had did not 
work in the new lock for the back door, 
they removed the lock mechanism. In
stead of replacing it when they left 
however, the mechanism was left out 
overnight, allowing anyone access to 
the house.
But I cant just blame Physical PlantThe University plays a large part in 
these problems. It built the houses, 
then forced the fraternity members to 
live on campus. But since then
22 years  the buildings have fallen 
into a state of disrepair. No wonder 
there are so many emergency repatf 
requests.
I must compliment the Universitythough, because it has plans to fix up 
the houses. Of course, it may be that 
repairs are only being made becau# 
city inspectors found code violation^ 
and it now has the money from a 
lease increase of 15 percent.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  9 September 1991
New Age men should face reality
Chris Restifo
At one point during the sum
mer, I grew tired of keeping up 
with current events around the 
world.
For once I just wanted to for
get about the possibility of Iraq 
developing nuclearweapons, the 
move toward democracy in 
Eastern Europe and the USSR, 
and the worsening state of the 
environment.
I simply desired to learn 
something that I could apply to 
my own personal life. To this 
end, I read an article in 
Newsweek that spoke of the new 
Mens Movement.
Yes, tired of being forced to 
make vast amounts of money 
and to be defined only by their 
monetary and career-oriented 
successes, hundreds, nay, thou
sands of white, middle-class men 
are learning to get in touch with 
their feelings.
For only $249  or something 
like thatthey proceed to some 
ancient Native American site to 
sit in huts heated by rocks placed 
in fires.
After becoming soaked in 
sweat and beating on drums, 
they cry out for warrior spirits 
to cleanse them. They scream 
and roar about the pain caused 
by their alcoholic, abusive fa
thers. They hug each other and 
find strength and renewal in this 
New Age male bonding.
If you get the impression that 
I feel these men are fools, you 
are absolutely correct.
It is not that I object to them 
getting in touch with their emo
tions or confronting repressed
feelings that have haunted them 
for years.
I do what they do every year 
for absolutely nothing. And to 
top it all off, I stay right at home 
to do it.
Like some of these enlight
ened men, I act out this ritual 
with my father.
Sometimes we invite our male 
neighbors over to join us. We 
dont need heated rocks since we
sucked into the MTV instant 
gratification state of mind.
Many of these men, in my opin
ion, are nothing more than whin
ers. They refuse to open their 
eyes and see that many of their 
goals have already been accom
plished by the feminist move
ment.
Whoa, you say. Wait one 
minute! Well, let me explain. One 
of the major goals of feminism
Oh, puh-lease!
Another thing that really irks 
me when it comes to these guys 
is the manner in which they 
speak about the pain their own 
fathers caused them.
One recurrent trend is alco
holism. A good portion of these 
New Age warriors are the chil
dren of alcoholic fathers.
Although alcoholism has fi
nally been designated a disI take back what I said earlier about those men getting 
in touch with their feelings. I feel that they are T.ietulo 
fools. Anyone who thinks that all of his or her conflicts 
or fears can be resolved by one simple weekend excur
sion has obviously been sucked into the MTV instant 
gratification state of mind.
do a pretty good job of working 
up a sweat all by ourselves. In a 
manner similar to the method 
used by the New Age men, we 
scream and shout. We make 
noises, but not with drums. We 
beat on whatever we can find  
tables, chairs, the dog, each 
other. We cry about failures and 
triumphs. We imbue special se
rums and potions to help us 
achieve a unique form of male 
bonding.
What is it that we do? Well, 
we watch football games, drink 
beer, and root for the Steelers 
every season.
OK, youve got me. I take back 
what I said earlier about those 
men getting in touch with their 
feelings.
I feel that they are absolute 
fools.
Anyone who thinks that all of 
his or her conflicts or fears can 
be resolved by one simple week
end excursion has obviously been
was  and is  to break down 
the stereotypes of man and 
woman.
Because of feminism, it became 
more socially acceptable to be a 
male nurse or secretary. Men also 
no longer had to be the bread 
winners. It was finally OK for 
fathers to stay home and take 
care of their children.
In short, feminists, among 
other things, urged men to get in 
touch with their feelings.
Today, years after feminists 
started advocating these ideals, 
these New Age men complain 
that they have been forced to 
become success objects. They 
were instructed to make $100,000 
a year. They had to work many, 
many hours of overtime.
What an utterly unbelievable 
method of reasoningas if their 
fathers, mothers, wives, and 
children all held guns to their 
heads and forced them to do so. 
As a friend of mine would say,
ease and society is coming to 
realize its impact, linking it to 
this New Age mens movement 
is ridiculous.
Please note that this is not to 
say children of alcoholics would 
not have problems developing 
long term relationships and 
sharing their feelings. They do. 
However, trying to blame what 
is nothing more than a glori
fied middle-age crisis on your 
fathers drinking problem is 
rather foolish.
I suggest that if they feel 
parental alcoholism really af
fected them, they should seek 
serious professional counsel
ing and therapy, not mystic 
weekend voodoo.
And if it wasnt your fathers 
alcoholism that forced you to 
become vice president of your 
company at the expense of time 
with your family, it was his 
absence.

I want a better quality of

students dont lose money if 
they dont use the full meal 
allowance or if they dont use 
all of their meals in a week.
Health care necessary for all
Abby Schiff
Youve probably read in the papers 
about the alarming tuberculosis epi
demic which is spreading rapidly 
through the nations cities. Or about the 
skjTocketing infant mortality rate  
higher in some inner-city neighborhoods 
than in many Third World countries.
Cant something be done to remedy 
these problems? These are not 
diseases that have modern medical sci
ence mystified. All are treatable in some 
capacity.
Only one thing stands between these 
victims and the treatment that they 
need and deserve  a lack of funds and 
a bureaucratic health care system that 
just doesnt work.
Our countrys health care policy is a . 
national embarrassment. Americans
Some propose that the federal government 
enact a system of national health care insur
ance in order to solve the problem.
who cannot afford health insurance are 
doomed to inferior care and treatment, 
and programs such as Medicaid cant 
even begin to bridge the gap that lies 
between those who can and cant pay 
for their medical needs.
Some propose that the federal gov
ernment enact a system of national 
health care insurance in order to solve 
the problem.
Why not? Canada has one, and so far 
it has proven successful. Citizens sim
ply pay an extra tax and in return the 
government pays their health care costs 
in full.
It is not so much socialized medicine 
as a federally subsidized insurance plan, 
and most importantly, everyone is in
sured.
True, no system is without its faults. 
Patients must wait longer in Canada 
for elective surgery and other nonemergency operations.
At the same time, however, all women 
have access to pre-natal care. People 
arent hesitant to visit a doctor when 
something is wrong, because cost is not 
an issue. Isnt it worth the price? 
Canadas government has taken re
sponsibility for its citizens health and 
well-being.
Its time the U.S. followed suit and 
made sure that everyone, not just the 
rich, can afford to be healthy.

New Agers: Accept responsibility
NEW AGERS, from page 9
Yes, dear old Dad spent so much 
time away at work that Johnny could 
never develop a growing, lasting re
lationship with Pop. It was either 
that or Dad didnt really care about 
his son.
They say that this situation was child 
abuse. Yes, since Daddy didnt take 
you to that ball game or spend enough 
time with you, you were abused! How 
do you correct this situation? Do you 
seek therapy? No! Do you resolve to 
spend more time with you kids so that 
they can avoid the same tragedy? No! 
You grab your buddy Bob and head off 
to the woods to sweat together for the 
entire weekend.
For all those who would argue that 
Im like these men in that I am re
pressing my anger and feelings, I say 
you are utterly wrong.
I have gotten in touch with my feel
ings. And my feelings tell me that I 
hate these pitiful attempts by these 
oppressed men to get in touch with 
their feelings.
Psychologists have shown that such 
get-well-quick schemes rarely have 
any lasting benefits.
If these men really are having 
trouble, they ought to take some of 
that hard-earned money and see a 
therapist. They ought to go to a dis
cussion group that meets periodically. 
The last thing they should do, how
ever, is whine the way they do and 
beat on drums. It might work on the 
weekend, but they still have to go 
back to their oppressive executive jobs 
on Monday.

engineering major.
Blame for theft rests on all who 
are careless, unthinking about 
safety of campus community
THEFTS, from page 8
Interestingly enough, the house leases 
will be up in 1995 and the University will 
begin breaking for new houses  most 
likely using the 15 percent increase to 
fund the new buildings.
This attitude doesnt only affect the 
fraternities. Locks on doors for organi
zations and the older dorms are anti
quated and easy to break into. Also, 
keys are not kept track of. I had a key to 
a Boss Hall room for a year after I 
moved out. One day, I found it and 
returned it  but what about the per
son who wouldnt return it? They could 
simply get into a room and walk off 
with whatever they wanted. No one 
would be any the wiser.
Campus Police cannot do the job 
alone. If preventive measures were 
taken by the University and Physical 
Plant, Campus Police could pay more 
attention to protecting the students 
and spotting the vans or trucks that 
must be needed to pull off such largescale thefts.
No one has the right to expect frater
nity members to post 24-hour guards, 
organizations like The Tartan and the 
Student Union to take home their com
puters every night, professors to lift up 
their desks and bring home their im
portant belongings, the students in CFA 
to store all their work in their dorm 
room, or to have any other member of 
the campus community afraid to leave 
their room, lest someone clean it out 
while they are in class.
Physical Plant says it is too busy to 
take care of these requests immediately. 
Is that why I see workers hanging out 
on the quad watching the traffic on 
Morewood? Or having races in their 
souped-up golf carts across campus?
The University says it has no money. 
Where does all of it go? Obviously not 
into keeping the buildings, dorms, and 
houses on campus up to code and theftfree. Most of it seems to go into keeping 
the cut filled with fresh manure.
I keep remembering the movie 
Teachers. I believe it was the teacher 
played by Nick Nolte who said: The 
students arent here for us, we are here 
for the students.
Maybe Im wrong, but thats what I 
thought education was all about. How 
is someone supposed to learn after be
ing robbed of everything they own  
simply because the University doesnt 
care?

Put aside the

the present
Carnegie Mellons football 
program entered a potentially 
frightening era on Saturday 
night. Yes, L.A.B. (Life After 
Bamyak) began with a 2312 
loss to Allegheny College. As 
well as Life After Snyder, and 
OToole, and Life After a host 
of other Tartan graduates.
Most CMU football fans are 
probably running for the 
nearest fallout shelter with a 
box of canned goods right 
about now. Quarterback Sam 
Mangano is probably being 
unjustly burned in effigy as 
you read this  that is, if we 
have any fans who take CMU 
football seriously enough. 
However, having gone through 
a similar depletion of seniors 
in high school, I consider 
myself well-trained to handle 
such a crisis.
To give a brief history, my 
beloved Swissvale High School 
lost running back Brian 
Chizmar, quarterback Ron 
Jendryjewski and six or seven 
other starters. Everyone put so 
much pressure on the heirs-apparent that the Golden Flashes 
tumbled to a two-win season. 
Basically, the new Flashes were 
told they stunk just often enough 
that they really started to be
lieve it and they played down to 
peoples expectations.
The point is this: the new 
faces you see in the Tartan 
starting lineup are just that  
brand-new people. Theyre 
going to need time to develop 
the sort of teamwork and 
ability that made last years 
team so good. Similarly, Coach 
Lackner and company are 
going to need some time to 
fine-tune the team to take 
maximum advantage of the 
abilities of his new players.
Look at the quarterback 
position. Putting it bluntly, 
Sam Mangano is not the 
throwing equal of Billy 
Snyder, but so what? Those of 
us who follow the Tartans 
know that Mangano is more of 
a scrambler than Snyder; as 
soon as the Carnegie Mellon 
offense adapts to take advan
tage of that skill  either by 
running Mangano or dangling 
it as a decoy to open up the 
passing game  well be 
rolling along just fine. Along 
those lines, Pero and Greg 
Marmol arent Scott Bamyak, 
but both ripped off a few good 
runs during the Allegheny 
game. At wide receiver, Jarrod 
Siket has the ability needed to 
get open, so the catches will 
come, even if hes not a perfect 
clone of Don DeCaro.
The bottom line is that 
Saturdays game was just one 
game in a long season, and it 
happened to be against one of 
the strongest opponents the 
Tartans could possibly face. If 
the fans give this team a 
chance to work together and 
learn from their mistakes, this 
season can yet have a happy 
ending. If the fans get down on 
this team just because they 
couldnt overcome the defend
ing Division III national 
champions, then we might as 
well just scrap the football 
program and run a videotape 
of last years games every 
Saturday night.

Case soccer upsets Tartans, 1-0
By JASON McDONALD
Tartan Sports Editor
On paper, the odds appeared 
to be stacked in the favor of the 
Carnegie Mellon mens soccer 
team as they travelled to Case 
Western Reserve University in 
Cleveland for Saturdays season 
opener. The preseason coaches 
poll in the University Athletic 
Association had the Tartans 
picked to finish fourth in the 
conference, while the Spartans 
were given a reservation for sev
enth place in the eight team
league. For that matter, not one 
of the coaches polled picked Case 
Western to finish higher than 
sixth.
Unfortunately, Case Western 
gave the UAA coaches cause to 
rethink their votes by pulling 
out a 1-0 victory over the Tar
tans. But this was no David and 
Goliath loss to the Tartans them
selves; they knew all along they 
were in for a hard-fought match.
We saw them play a few weeks 
ago, so we knew theyd be tough, 
said senior striker Rob Schaeffer.
The Spartans scored their goal
on a 12-yard header midway 
through the second period, and 
the Tartans couldnt get the 
equalizer, though senior Alan 
Horn hit the post with time run
ning down.
It [the Case goal] was a nice 
play, but the kid really should 
have been picked up, said se
nior striker Rob Schaeffer. A1 
hit the post late; we missed a 
breakaway. We had our 
chances.
Injuries to the strikers was 
another big problem, according 
to Schaeffer. I was only about
sixty percent because of an in
jury from the AB game; Im hav
ing an X-ray on my heel. Young 
[Kang] got cracked pretty early 
in the Case game, and Terence 
[Sibiya] is back but isnt up to 
100 percent, though hes looking 
pretty good. I feel confident that 
we would have beaten them if 
we had two healthy strikers. 
The Tartans next challenge 
comes tomorrow night when they 
host the University of Pittsburgh 
at 7:30 pm. The first home game 
of the season is always a big one, 
but playing Pitt makes the game
even more important.
The mere fact that theyre a 
Division I school gets us up for 
the game, said Schaeffer. Its 
also a big game because we 
havent lost to them is seven 
years. Its like the soccer brag
ging rights for Pittsburgh, so we 
get pretty psyched up for the 
game.
After the Pitt game, the Tar
tans take to the road to plaV 
Washington University in Stj. 
Louis. A victory in the Saturday 
match-up would even Camegi 
Mellons UAA record at 1-1.

Tartan quarterback Sam Mangano scrambles through the Allegheny 
defense during Saturdays 23-12 loss.
By NATALIE M. GESMOND 
& JUDY GROSSMAN
Tartan Staffiuriters
The Carnegie Mellon Tartans and Allegheny 
College Gators collided in Saturday nights sea
son opener at Gesling Stadium; the ensuing battle 
thrilled the more than 3,600 fans who showed up 
in anticipation of an all-out war between two 
highly-ranked teams.
The final score was 23-12 in favor of the defend
ing Division III national champion Gators, but 
the game was closer than that. Allegheny led only 
10-6 at halftime, scoring the remaining thirteen 
points in the fourth quarter.
We played really hard, said head coach Rich 
Lackner. I dont think we lost the game because 
we lacked effort. They were the better football 
team this evening and they deserved to win the 
game.
Both teams displayed potent rushing attacks, 
the Tartans edging Allegheny 199 to 196 yards. 
But the Gator passing game took flight as quar
terback Ben Cammarano threw for 117 yards 
while Tartan senior quarterback Sam Mangano 
completed only two passes for 21 yards. Mangano, 
however, wasnt disappointed.
The running game was working well for us, he
said. It doesnt really matter how many passes I' 
throw. I just want to do whatever it takes, within, 
the game plan, for us to win.
I dont think the coaches lack confidence in the 
receiving corps, said sophomore receiver Andyj 
Van Sprang, who had one catch for nine yards. I 
just think the situations were such that they 
thought the running game could do the job.
The Gators drew first blood midway through 
the opening quarter, after senior Andy Helms 
fumbled punt return gave Allegheny possession 
at the Tartan 10. But a big sack on second down by 
All-American linebacker Mike Hession pushed 
the Gators back to the 18, and an incomplete pass 
on third down forced them to settle for a 34-yard 
field goal.
On an earlier play, junior defensive back John 
Fratto suffered a dislocated left shoulder, and is 
expected to miss at least three weeks. This forced 
comerback Jeff Palaima to move over to Fratto^ 
strong safety position, while senior Doug Stauffei* 
filled in for Palaima at the comer.
Ill probably play strong safety for the next 
couple of games, said Palaima. But Im not 
really worried because weve got a lot of good 
athletes, guys to fill in for John.

The CMU womens volleyball team 
got off to a shaky but promising start 
last weekend as it hosted its annual 
invitational tournament. The two-day 
event featured a total of nine teams 
including California University of Penn
sylvania, Carlow College, Geneva Col
lege, Mercyhurst College, University of 
Pittsburgh-Johnstown, Seton Hill Col
lege, St. Vincent College, and 
Westminster College.
Carnegie Mellons first match in the 
tournament came against California 
University of Pennsylvania, the even
tual tournament champion. Having al
ready played one match in the tourna
ment, California dominated the first 
game with their powerful hitting and 
consistently good serving. CMU looked 
understandably nervous in the first 
game, but began to settle down in the 
second with good front-line play by jun
iors Elizabeth Rowlands, Lisa 
Leonardo, and Heather Thompson.
We started out a little slow because 
we had just received the line-up and 
hadnt really practiced together very 
much, said Thompson. It took a little 
while to get used to the positions, added 
junior Ann Feng.
At times, the Tartans looked a bit 
unorganized as the result of frequent 
line-up changes, but they began to settle 
down in the third game as they became 
more comfortable with their positions 
and teammates. Improvement was defi
nitely seen over the match; however, 
California defeated the Tartans in 
straight games 15-3,15-4, and 15-7.
Freshman Carolyn Skarada found the 
college level of competition something 
Id never experienced before, but once 
you get into the game you have to get 
used to it.
The Tartans played the next oppo
nent, Carlow College, immediately fol
lowing California. Although their play 
was still improving, CMU was defeated 
handily the first two games, 15-5 and 
15-3.
However, the team had the first taste 
of its potential in the third game of that 
match. CMU rallied from a 18 deficit 
to 7-10 with the help of good serving by 
junior Lisa Devlin. The Tartans man
aged to hold their opponents again later 
at game-point while they inched from 9 
to 13 points, but Carlow triumphed in 
the end, 1513.
Devlin said that the team started 
out slowly, but got pumped at the end 
with all the fans. We need that kind of 
support more often.
Tournament play ended for the 
evening; however, bright and early at 
nine oclock Saturday morning the ac
tion resumed on all three gymnasium 
courts. CMUs bright spot in the tour
nament came at this time against 
Geneva College.
We really improved coming into to
day [Saturday], commented Rowlands. 
We seemed to progressively get better, 
and it paid off. Head coach Charlotte 
Fisher said she was pleased with 
Fridays matches because the team 
made progress throughout each one.
Although the teams seemed evenly 
matched, the first two games ended 
much like the previous matches. The 
Tartans lost a hard-fought first game, 
15-11. A late rally at the end of game 
two gave CMU its first lead (13-12) of 
any game in the tournament before 
Geneva came back to win 15-13.
The feeling of success at the end of 
the second game gave the team the 
momentum that made every aspect of 
their game pick up and become more 
aggressive, said Fisher.
Perseverance, good teamwork, and 
more aggressive play did pay off as the

The Tartans cross country 
teams began a new season of 
competition against the Cali
fornia University of Pennsyl
vania on Saturday. Both Tar
tan teams had impressive 
showings, winningeasily over 
the California competition.
The California mens team 
faced not only a tough group 
of CMU runners, but also a 
winning tradition that dates 
back to 1978. CMU held a vir
tual lock on the top spots  
Tartan runners held the sec
ond through seventh positions
 and cruised to a 4520 vic
tory.
Sophomore Jim Langer was 
the first Tartan runner to finish 
the course, posting a time of 
27:01. Freshman Tim Davison 
ran a 27;16 to finish third, and 
junior Rich Hayes took fourth 
with a time of 27:30. Freshman 
Mike Didkowski (27:51), junior 
Scott Phillips (28:12); and jun
ior Bryan Keyes (28:34) rounded 
out the six-spot run.
Senior Carolyn Lowe led the 
way for the women, winning the 
race in a time of 20:04, while 
junior Laura Sibley ran a close 
second (20:05). Junior Wendy 
Evans (21:25), senior Emily
Burke (22:22), and sophomore 
Aliza Hildebrand (22:29^finished fourth, sixth, and sev
enth respectively to give the 
Tartans a final meet score of 
20.
Womens head coach Dario 
Donatelli was pleased with 
the race. It was a good over
all start for us, he said. We 
had two people [Hildebrand 
and Evans] who hadnt run 
since high school. We defi
nitely got some confidence 
from this race.
California will get a chance 
for revenge this weekend 
when the Tartans travel to 
the California Invitational 
this Saturday.

VOLLEYBALL, from page 13
Tartans broke into the win col
umn, 15-8. With that one under 
their belts, there was no stop
ping them as they went on to 
win the fourth game by the same 
margin.
Everything kept building af
ter that third game. We began to 
control the match and carried it 
through to the end, said Fisher.
For the fifth and deciding 
game, the tournament used what 
is called a rally score. This 
means that instead of only re
ceiving points when your team 
serves, one team receives a point 
each time a volley ends. This 
method of scoringis used to make 
the game move along faster. 
CMU kept the momentum alive 
as it defeated Geneva in this 
deciding game 15-11, and 
claimed its first match victory in 
the tournament.
The Tartans final match of 
the tournament was against 
Seton Hill College. After the long
match with Geneva, the Tar
tans seemed to tire quickly dur
ing the Seton Hill match.
I think it was a mental break
down because we got so ex
hausted, said Rowlands, but I 
dont think that will happen once 
we get into the season.
We were definitely exhausted 
by the second match, added 
Devlin.
The match was short-lived as 
Seton Hill defeated CMU in 
three straight games (157,15-
4, and 154) but the team re
mained positive about the expe
rience.
We feel good about the tour. nament. We had a good time and 
were better now than we were 
at this time last year, com
mented Devlin. We have so 
much more depth this year, 
added Rowlands.
When asked about the changes 
in the line-up, Fisher said she 
thinks she has found a basic 
eight or nine players who will
see the majority of playing time, 
but with more depth I have many 
options and will be able to keep 
changing.
Despite Carnegie Mellons 
slow start in its first tourna
ment, the team is very positive 
about its progress this past week
end. Were much further along 
now than at the same time last 
year and thats what were re
ally happy about, commented 
Thompson.
The team made great strides 
this weekend and really started 
to gel, said coach Charlotte 
Fisher. Added junior Lisa 
Devlin, We had a good time, 
and for a first competition, no 
one is disappointed. 
Thompson promises, Were 
going to be good this year, so we 
need a lot of fans! The Tartans 
return to action with a home 
game on Tuesday, September 
10 at 6 pm. The Tartans oppo
nents will be Bethany College 
and Pitt-Johnstown.
Womens soccer drops varsity opener
By DAVE MARTIN
Tartan Staffwriter
Carnegie Mellons womens 
soccer team took the field for the 
first time as a varsity sport this 
Saturday, taking on Case West
ern Reserve University, a var
sity team since 1982. CWRUtook 
advantage of early mistakes 
made by the Tartans and won 
the game 2-0.
Coach Julie Shackford as
sessed her teams performance. 
We came out flat in the first 
half. We did too many funda
mental things wrong, she said. 
One-on-one coverage, which 
Shackford said wasnt tight 
enough through the first half, 
was of particular concern.
After the intermission, the 
team rallied and its intensity 
was up, according to Shackford. 
We had more attack in the sec
ond half and our marking was a 
lot tighter. We didnt concede 
any goals, she said.
The team did have bright 
spots, though. Junior sweeper 
Sonya Chmielnicki and sopho
mores Anh Nguyen and Julie
Paul played a very solid defen
sive game. Those three [women] 
played well defensively and re
ally kept us in the game, said 
Shackford. I wasnt displeased 
[with the game]. Everything 
takes time.
The Tartans return to action 
Thursday with a 7:30 pm game 
against St. Francis College. The 
game marks the beginning of a 
three-game homestand that in
cludes a Saturday match against 
Slippery Rock, and a September
18 game against Allegheny Col- ' 
lege.

Drayton leads Gators past CMU
FOOTBALL, from page 13
game, 6-3, early in the second 
quarter. Senior halfback Greg 
Marmol scored the Tartans lone 
offensive touchdown on a nineyard run.
It was a power-counter, said 
Marmol. The offensive line had 
the defense blocked pretty well, 
Griffin [Pero] made a nice block, 
and I jogged in, untouched.
The Tartans, known for their 
ball-control offense, took 15 
plays and 6:25 to put the ball in 
the end zone. Key third-down 
conversions characterized the 
drive, as Marmol rushed for 11 
yards on third and six, and Pero 
picked up 13 yards on third and 
12 to give the Tartans first down 
at the Allegheny nine.
Tailback Stanley Drayton, 
nicknamed the Bottle Rocket 
because his versatility and speed 
are reminiscent of former Notre 
Dame star Raghib Rocket 
Ismail, rushedforl36 yards and 
scored all three Gator touch
downs, the first on a seven yard 
run in the second quarter, fol
lowing Marmols touchdown.
After Drayton broke away for 
28 yards to the Gator 40, 
Cammarano hit receiver Julio 
Lacayo for 18 yards and Rob 
Gardner for 36 yards to the Tar
tan six. Two plays later, Drayton 
scampered around the right end 
to put the Gators up 10-6 going 
into halftime.
Hes a great back, Hession 
said of Drayton. All you need to 
give him is a little hole and hes 
through there. He just explodes.
Tartan rushers also found suc
cess in the first half, gaining 130 
yards on 27 carries. Pero led the 
way with seven carries for 57 
yards. Marmol added 45 on 12 
attempts, and finished the game 
with 101 yards.
But it was Drayton who 
clinched the game for the Gators 
on a pair of one-yard touchdown 
runs in the final period. The first 
score culminated a 15-play, 81- 
yard drive that ate 7:07 off the 
clock.
The drive was highlighted by a 
22-yard pass from Cammarano 
to Drayton that positioned Al
legheny at the Tartan 46. An 
offsides penalty against the Tar
tans on third and three gave the 
Gators first and goal at the nine. 
Three plays later, Drayton 
busted through to put Allegheny 
up 16-6 in the opening minute of 
the fourth quarter.
Draytons very quick, said 
sophomore defensive tackle Ben 
Burton. When he got the ball, 
hed go for almost five yards ev
ery time. It was tough to shut 
him down.
Helms picked up a Drayton 
fumble and ran it 38 yards for a 
touchdown late in the quarter to 
bring the Tartans within four 
points, 16-12. But the extra point 
failed and the Tartans found 
themselves needing a touchdown 
with 5:33 remaining.
Following the kickoff, Allegh
eny put together an 11-play, 58- 
yard scoring drive that put the 
game out of reach. Once again a 
Tartan penalty  this time a 
personal foulmovedthe Gators 
within striking distance to the 
Carnegie Mellon 11 yardline.
From there it was all Drayton; 
three consecutive running plays 
to the All-American halfback 
gave Allegheny first and goal 
inside the one.
We had some tough goal line 
stands in the game, said Bur
ton. But when the other teams 
got first and goal with one yard 
to go, its tough to hold them on 
four straight downs.

The season started out on a 
sour note for the CMU womens 
tennis team as it dropped two of 
three games in the Zides Top
per Tennis Classic at West Lib
erty University this past week
end.
In the first game, freshman 
Stephanie Kukura (#4 singles) 
and the third doubles pair of 
Monica andKinga Czerska (also 
freshmen) won their first colle
giate matches in the teams 6-3 
loss to West Liberty University.
The teams first victory of the 
season came in the second round 
of games against Akron Univer
sity, a Division I school; the Tar
tans won 54.
Monica and Kinga Czerska 
won what teammate Sharyn 
Rotunno called a thrilling threeset match in the third match of 
the tournament against Indiana 
University of Pennsylvania with 
scores of 1-6, 7-6 (12-10), 6-3. 
The pair saved six match points 
and rallied back from a 15 defi
cit to win the second set. IUP 
won the overall game, 8-1.
Along with winning their first 
collegiate matches this weekend, 
Kukura went on to win the fourth 
singles championship, and the 
Czerskas won the third doubles 
championship.
This week, the team plays a 
Thursday match against 
Chatham College before hosting 
Fairmont State College on Sat
urday.
It took Drayton only one try to 
cross the goal line and give Al
legheny a 22-12 lead with 1:30 
left. Then Chris Merski, who 
missed the previous point after, 
nailed this one to make the final 
score 23-12.
 We had a lot of opportunities 
presented to us that we didnt 
capitalize on, and our defense 
was just on the field much too 
long, said Mangano. Weve got 
a ball control offense and we 
didnt control the ball.
The Tartans (01) must now 
regroup for their first Univer
sity Athletic Association 
matchup with the Washington 
University Bears Saturday at 
Gesling Stadium. Kickoff is at 
1:30 pm.
In 1990s season opener, the 
Tartans beat Washington, 35 
21, en route to an undefeated season and a Division III play
off berth. But the ever-improving Bears made a strong showinglast year and surprised their 
UAA foes with a second place 
conference finish and a 7-3 over
all record.
It [Wash U.] is a whole new 
ballgame, said Lackner. We 
cant do anything about what 
happened here tonight except 
learn from it tomorrow and move. 
on from there.
The Bears are gonna come in 
here ready to play football, said 
Marmol. Weve just got to col
lect ourselves, hold our heads 
high, and be ready for them.

NFL FOOTBALL
" by Dave Martin
, Welcome back to another sea. son of NFL Football, the only 
, column where some arrogant
- guy whom no one knows says 
that this is the way it is in the 
National Football League, and 
then proves himself wrong.
Its been a fairly average off
season. Joe Montana is on in jured reserve and wont be able 
to lead the Niners for the first 
few weeks of the season. Eddie 
DeBartolo saw fit to rid himself 
of two of his most seasoned vet
erans, Ronnie Lott and Roger 
Craig, which, if you think about 
it, makes some kind of sense 
,(though Im not exactly sure 
what kind). Bill Parcells retired 
and has joined a host of other 
coaches in the world of football 
, broadcasting. New England has 
a new coach, finally. Vic Kiam 
took a few more shots at Lisa 
Olsen, and the world champion 
New York Giantsnew coach told 
Phil Simms to take a seat on the 
bench, and gave a graduate of 
West Virginia University (Jeff 
Hostetler) the starting nod. All 
, in all, a summer of the normal 
unpredictable actions of the NFL 
. and its inhabitants.
, Normally, I would take this 
, space to predict how the season 
, will turn out, but the first Sun
day proved how difficult that 
could be. New England won its 
^season opener. Randall Cun
ningham of the Philadelphia 
Eagles probably lost a few steps 
after suffering a season-ending 
knee injury. Vinny Testaverde 
of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 
threw only one interception in 
his first game back. After wit
nessing this chaos, I decided that 
Id rather sit and watch what 
happens before I pick a Super 
Bowl champion (Buffalo) and its 
opponent (doesnt really matter). 
So, now, I will shock and amaze 
you with predictions that often 
make sense, but hey, the NFL 
looks different to different 
people.
Jeff Hostetler leads the de
fending champion Giants into
I really despise 
Jimmy Johnson, 
but I must admit 
that in only a 
couple of years, 
hes built up a 
team that was 
hopeless before 
his arrival.
Soldier Field Sunday against Da 
Bears. The Giants struggled 
with San Francisco last week, 
but won on a last-second field 
goal. The Bears squeaked by 
Minnesota in game one.. Should 
be an interesting game. Take 
the visitors indefensive struggle, 
13-9. j 
The San Francisco 49ers travel 
to wild, wonderful Minnesota. 
The Vikings have forced the
Niners to struggle the last few 
years while being led by the god
like JoeMontana. ButtheNiners 
will be missing his presence on 
the turf and Young will prove to 
everyone hes not worth his new 
contract. Minnesota 27, S.F. 14.
In the rest of the league.... The 
Chargers at home over Atlanta, 
Dallas over ailing Philadelphia, 
the Bills over the Jets easily, 
Denver to beat Seattle, the Raid
ers over the Colts, Miami in the 
Silverdome over Detroits sput
tering Silver Streak, the Bengals 
win the battle for Ohio over 
Cleveland, Tampa over Green 
in the Battle of the Bays, the 
Steelers struggle to beat the 
Patriots (by less than 20), the 
Redskins over an improving 
Phoenix team, and the Rams 
fall to the Saints in the 
Superdome.
Tonights game poses an in
teresting match-up between two 
old rivals, the Washington 
Redskins and the Dallas Cow
boys. Texas Stadium is rarely a 
happy place for the Redskins, 
and the Cowboys will surely be 
ready to show them as bad a 
time as they can.
I really despise Jimmy John
son, but I must admit that in 
only a couple of years, hes built 
up a team that was hopeless 
before his arrival. While Dallas 
proved the existence of its of
fense in week one, remember 
who they played  Cleveland. 
Dallas will force the Skins to 
prove their worth. And how 
much are they worth? I expect, 
not as much as many feel. Take 
Dallas in a very mild upset, 24- 
17.

Under the new rule, a team may 
forfeit one game without pen

Tartan Junior Staffwriter
From between the timbers of a con
verted barn nestled in the ancient Penn
sylvanian hills, bursts the staccato whine 
of a ragtime clarinet. Its pitch sifts with 
the catch of a snare and the release of a 
trombone, becoming signature of an 
American style bom over 70 years ago in 
the heart of St. Louis. Its classic jazz; 
music whose powerful melodies were 
given life long before the King or British 
Beatle mania. The New Orleans style, 
the great grandaddy of all jazz, is lent 
the energy of an entire era by a gifted 
band of Carnegie Mellon alumni in love 
with the tunes of a time long before their 
own.
This night, about an hour outside of 
Pittsburgh, the Boilermaker 5 play a gig 
under the frame of a civil-war era barn 
refurbished into a gathering place for 
the better part of the small community. 
Amidst the antiques on the walls and the 
smell of seasoned wood, the music of this 
six-man band is yanked from its histori
cal resting place into the present. The 
alumni belts rifts originally played by 
bands like Punch Millers Bunch and 
The New Orleans Stompers with an 
abandonous improvisation that over
comes age. Theres something about this 
jazz thats joyous; something that seems 
to overcome everything else, said Paul
Daniel Frey/Tartan Photo Staff Manageruaniei rrey/ lanan rnoto starr ivianager
Cosentino, one of the Boilermakers 
founding members and 88 CMU alum 
who majored in IM.
Cosentino and his younger brother Jay 
Cosentino, who graduated in 89 with a 
major in electrical engineering, have long 
shared a passion for a music that was 
bom of parade bands and a certain Crfeole influence at the turn of the century . 
Their grandfather, a working jazz pia
nist, introduced to them a taste for early 
jazz as they stumbled through records 
by men like Willie and Purcey Humphry, 
soaking in the styles they wished to make 
their own. Through high school, with J ay 
Cosentino on the trombone and Paul 
Cosentino the clarinet, the brothers 
struggled with forming several of their 
own bands. I could never find the kinds 
of people that wanted or were able to mix 
in the right improvisation I was looking 
for, says the older brother. That all 
changed at CMU.
I found people here that were ex
tremely motivated and dedicated to their 
chosen field, continued Paul Cosentino, 
Most of all, though, I found people that 
were as excited as I was to be together 
playing jazz. The outlet was a group at 
CMU, composed of mostly non-music 
majors eager to break away from the 
rigor of study. Indeed, he had come to 
study business and his younger brother, 
to learn engineering. Our parents had 
convinced us that music was best a hobby, 
 commented Paul Cosentino. The broth
ers credit the former head of the jazz 
ensemble, artist/lecturer Randy Purcell, 
with teaching them much of what they 
know about the pitfalls and peaks of the 
jazz industry. Randy communicated a 
lot about the music business  how to 
deal with clubs, talent agents, even how 
to act on the bandstand, said Paul 
Cosentino. It was here at CMU  get
ting together with friends, he said, just 
to grab a beer and play awhile in a 
practice room over at Margaret 
Morrison,  that the human and pro
fessional resources to form the Boiler
makers were to be found.
David Collier, the bands drummer and 
another 89 electrical engineering gradu
ate, was the younger Cosentino's room
mate their senior year and he drummed 
really well on his dashboard in his car, 
said Jay Cosentino. After buying a ga
rage sale drum set, however, Collier be
gan to learn the New Orleans style. Simi
larly, the groups banjo playing is pro
vided by a third 89 electrical engineer
ing graduate, Doug Ellena, who was origi
nally a guitar player until he was given 
the New Orleans rhythm section staple 
as a gift and was convinced by the fledg
ling band to develop the style. Big Gerry 
Gagnon, who graduated from CMU last 
year with a njajor in physics, lays down 
the bass of the rhythm section on tuba. 
When we began, we decided this time to 
do it right, said Paul Consentino. The 
Boilermaker 5 took their name from a 
drink popular with Pittsburgh steel work
ers, and practiced for months before they 
received their premier gig with the help

Juggling club keeps jugglers on the ball
By KEVIN COONEY
[ Tartan Junior Staffwriter
What can you do when youre 
stressed out, trying for the third 
;time to understand a canonical 
sum of a logic function? Before 
you throw the books on the floor 
in disgust, take a hike to Grey 
Matter some Saturday afternoon, 
pick up some bean-bag balls, and 
start juggling.
I do it for therapy only, said 
;'i University of Pittsburgh medical 
^technology masters candidate 
Skip Foraam. Between juggling, 
school and family I was stressed 
out. After reading about juggling 
one of his wifes magazines, he 
took it up and found it relaxing.
While passing through Skibo, 
Pomam discovered the Juggling 
Club and club president Ben 
Schoenberg, a senior math major.
The Juggling Club was founded 
six years ago by Pitt graduate J eff 
Mason and CMU alumni Rick 
Rubenstein and Jack Kalvan. The 
club functions to provide an op
portunity to teach people and to 
practice tricks and ideas with 
other jugglers in Pittsburgh. It is 
a loose, fun organization where 
[people] can learn to juggle, 
Schoenberg explained.
The Juggling Club is one of the 
few CMU organizations which 
includes many non-CMU students 
as participants. Ira Lederer, a 
twelve year-old whose parents 
work at CMU, has been regularly 
attending meetings for two and a 
half years, and sometimes puts 
less-experienced members to 
shame. He picks up most things 
without practicing them, com
mented Schoenberg, and he 
maintains his skills without prac
ticing much.
Three years ago, the club ap
plied for funding from Student 
Senate, and bought $900 worth of 
juggling equipment for teaching 
purposes. Everything from hard 
and soft juggling balls to pins to 
diablos (Greek for two bolos) is 
available for anyones use. Often 
through the day, people of all lev
els of experience pass through, 
pick up a few balls, and start 
practicing.
The club is a very loose organi
zation. Elections dont make 
much sense, Schoenberg said, 
smiling. He is concerned that the 
club might disappear when he 
graduates, but is comforted by 
the large number of freshmen who 
are interested in juggling.
Joe Lyons, a Pittsburgh resi
dent and juggler for 10 years, 
initially felt intimidated by the
I don't know if I would have kept going if I didnt have a 
place to juggle. 
 Scott Johnson, 
Pittsburgh resident
thought of going to a college cam
pus to juggle, but now attends 
meetings for up to six hours a 
night to talk to other jugglers, 
practice, and get ideas. Its mostly 
a social thing, he said while 
warming up on a pair of devil 
sticks. Lyons is hoping to have a 
mini-festival for Pittsburgh jug
glers at CMU, with workshops for 
experienced and new jugglers.
Lyons works/odd jobs and has 
even played Santa Claus during 
Christmas time, but hopes to get
morejugglingjobs soon. Juggling 
jobs are nice ... they pay well, he 
admitted. Lyons will be teaching 
a community college course on 
juggling as well.
As Lyons practiced an act with 
squash rackets, Gleb Klioner com
mented Its gotta be the shoes. 
Klioner, a Junior IM major, was 
working on juggling pins. He said, 
I just started doing this the other 
day, and look what I can do. 
Posing for a picture was a little 
difficult, however. Did you get
it? Klioner asked. Itll never 
happen again.
Scott Johnson, also a Pittsburgh 
resident, learned how to juggle in 
a community college course. Al
though he has juggled flaming 
torches, a bowling ball, and d 
machete, he insists that he just 
does it for fun. His juggling teach
ers went to the club in 1983, and 
introduced him to it I dont know 
if I would have kept going if I 
didnt have a place to juggle.

ucts that hes worn the great 
minds of the ad game to the very 
bone of creativity.
Its late, hot, and since morning 
the brain trusts over at Gatorade 
have been locked in conference

with an orange lightning bolt 
streaking down the center. Theyre

I would imagine that even an 
honorary literate athlete like 
Michael Jordan could get slightly 
confused after swearing loyalty 
to his fifth brand of cola or sneak
ers. Maybe thats why while walk
ing off the court after the Bulls 
won the NBA championship, Jor
dan looked pensively into a tele
vision camera from behind a bottle 
of Gatorade, a can of Coke and a 
pair of Nikes and said, "Just 
j Disneyland it! When the camera 
then zoomed in, it was interest
ing to watch Jordans broad 
tongue shoot out like a cash 
drawer as he lay the collection of

I noticed his cash drawer shoots 
out after every soaring basket he 
slams too. I guess he either likes 
his money up front or hes stick
ing his tongue out at viewers like 
me who measure our vertical 
jumps by the number of strips of 
toilet paper which can be slipped 
between the feet and ground at 
the very peak of flight.

WHATEVER HAPPENED TO PLATINUM BLONDES?
by Andrew Cosentino
father, and just by playing a game 
he makes enough money to buy 
Times Square back from the Japa
nese, if he so desires. See, because 
what America hasnt got in guys 
who can make good cars and mi
cro chips, we make up for with the 
guys who can loft rubber balls 
through metal hoops, sometimes 
from pretty dam far out. And kids 
should know about this stuff.
So I guess Jordans alright, but 
there are plenty of other guys 
waiting, some of them even sali
vating, in the crowded wings of 
endorsement who would turn a 
subtle slogan like Gatorades into 
a social nightmare. Just pick an 
athlete, anyone. Oh, I dont know 
 Willie McGee? O.K., Willie
McGee. Be like Willie. The way 
I see it, to Be like Willie would 
not just mean to drink Gatorade, 
but to walk around with a seem
ingly painful gimp, looking like 
youve just smelled something 
really bad, and answering any 
question with a series of prefabri
cated phrases like, you know, 
coach says, uhnun, or, you know, 
Im just taking one game at a 
time, or, you know, or, you 
know, coach says its a long sea
son, or, you know, Im just out 
there to help the team, or, you 
know, I got to do whats best for 
Willie McGee, or, you know, 
coach says we got to work on our 
intangibles.
I mean, you put a guy like 
McGee and Len nerve ending 
Dykstra in the same room, wind 
them up, and let them go, and 
youve got yourself enough man
nerisms and airborne spit to open
up a roadside freak show.
The funny thing about profes
sional athletes is that I really 
believe that in the privacy of their 
homes, they rarely fidget, and 
speak extremely well. Its their 
agents who tell them to speak the 
athletes lingo so that the players 
dont tarnish their burly images 
or destroy pre-game locker room 
morale with stuffy phrases like, 
you know, coach says it would be 
mighty goode of you to pass ye 
olde jock hither, my fellow chap in 
sport.
Oh well, Jordan should be get
ting back from Disneyland any 
day now. Maybe he can earn some 
spending money by telling a cam
era man what a great time he had 
there  What, Disneyland? You 
cant beat the feeling.

Beware the poisonous plants
By ERIN GRUNZKE
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Over one million Americans 
sufferfrom plantpoisoningeach 
year, but efforts being made at 
the Carnegie Natural History 
Museum to increase public 
awareness on the problem. The 
exhibit, Pretty Deadly: Poison
ous Plants of Forest, Field, and 
Garden," now on display 
through October 20, shows and 
describes poisonous plants to 
watch out for in the Western 
Pennsylvania area.
The exhibition is a culmina
tion of resources from Phipps 
Conservatory, the Carnegie 
Natural History Museum, Hunt 
Institute Botanical Library, and 
the Pittsburgh Poison Center. 
Theplants exhibited are almost 
exclusively common household 
or garden varieties found in the 
western Pennsylvania tri-state 
area. Due to a newly renovated 
gallery, the museum is able to 
accommodate both living speci
mens and an array of hybernium 
artwork as well. A wide selection of literature dating from 
the Ancient Greeks and early 
Western Civilization to the 
present is also displayed.
The history of plants and the 
close botanical-medicinal rela
tionships are largely present in 
todays pharmaceuticals, saic 
Fred Utech, botany curator anc 
contributing exhibition orga^ 
nizer. Modem pharmacy is es. 
sentially a combination of 
botanical chemistry and his
tory.
The exhibition hopes to tar
get all age groups and increase 
poison prevention. Numerous 
pamphlets, reference articles, 
case studies pertaining to indi
vidual plants within the exhibi
tion, and information on up
coming classes and lectures for 
children and adults are avail
able inside the museum.
Dr.J.D.Jacobsen, contribut
ing exhibitioner and Carnegie 
Mellon Botany Professor said, 
the exhibit is an attempt to 
educate and increase local 
awareness of what is literally 
lurking in your back yard.

Boilermaker 5 inspires Pittsburgh with Jazz
BOILERMAKERS, from page LL
of Purcell.
Today, two and a half years 
later, the Boilermakers are be
ginning to come to a few realiza
tions. Theyre beginning to real
ize subtle success is partnered 
with gallons of sweat. College 
graduation has come and gone, 
and all the members have regular 
^day gigs, as they call them, that 
seem complete departures from 
the humid streets of New Orleans 
touched upon in their music. The 
band members diverge in their 
professions; sales, engineering, 
programming all spread across 
Pittsburgh and beyond. Both Dave 
Duckworth, the bands pianist and 
the only member of the band that 
did not attend Carnegie Mellon, 
and Ellena, the banjo player, un
dertake a four-hour commute from 
jobs in Washington to play with 
the band every weekend.
It seems, however, that the Boil
ermaker 5 have begun to carve a 
Unique niche in Pittsburgh, ush
ering Mardi Gras a bit farther
north. The music is truly infec
tious, said Paul Cosentino, Ive 
begun to see the same faces over 
and over again, and its the nicest 
compliment we could ever get. 
Those tables now belong to some 
of the citys most recognized cen
ters for jazz. The Allegheny Brew
ery was convinced when it opened 
over a year ago that the New 
Orleans sound was an interest
ing prospect for its German beer 
hall theme and the Boilermakers 
soon made good on their first big 
break. Since, they have become 
regulars, and developed a diminu
tive, but loyal following. By the 
end of some nights, people who 
had never heard of classicjazz are 
dancing on the tables, he said. 
People in college came to the 
Brewery because it was the new 
in place, and left with a great 
appreciation for something Ive 
loved all my life.
With increasing publicity, em
bracing the classicjazz sound has 
grown much more lucrative for 
many local establishments  in
cluding the Balcony, a restaurant 
in Shadyside which had been re
luctant to hire the Boilermakers 
due to what Paul Cosentino terms 
a stereotype.
We dont wear straw hats and 
striped suits, throwing peanuts 
to the crowd. We are completely 
loyal to the historic tradition of a 
unique American art form. I feel a 
responsibility to give this jazz as 
much as it has given me. The 
Balcony recently agreed to host 
The Boilermaker 5 on Thursday 
night.
Theres a whole generation that 
hasnt heard this music. People 
are now looking to the past for 
their future, said Jay Cosentino.
The future for the Boilermak
ers, however, is largely a step-bystep process. We are sort of in 
limbo, he continued, where a 
few of us have to either decide to 
make it full-time or give it up 
altogether.
Duckworth joined last year as a 
replacement for Tom Roberts, a 
renowned pianist who left to play 
in Leon Redbones jazz band. One
minute Im playing next to Tom, 
the next hes on the Carson Show. 
Things can happen that fast, but 
its more often a lot of blood, sweat 
and tears, commented Paul 
Cosentino.
Eventually, the band hopes to 
embark on a series of road trips, 
but doing so involves a great many 
decisions for individual band 
members. Its very hard to take a 
few years off from being an engi
neer, said Jay Cosentino.
The Boilermaker 5, however, 
have time on their side. Their
youth, exuberant, and captivat
ing on stage, serves as fascinat
ing contrast to the age of their 
music, but not its energy.
They are in league with the 
unmatched longevity of their 
medium, as their jazz is a consis
tent reflection of New Orleans at 
its roaring height.
Its an immortal passion that 
keeps these old jazz greats alive 
so long, said Paul Cosentino. If 
they ever put down their instru
ments I think they might just wilt 
away.

JUGGLERS, from page LI
\ Johnson, like many members, 
offered advice for other jugglers. 
A good way to juggle, he said, is to 
face a wall to avoid distraction. 
Jugglers with a small budget can 
juggle with tennis balls with 33 
pennies in each ball (a trick to 
make them heavy so they wont 
roll or bounce around).
Steve Aiello, a freshman music 
recording major, also practiced
with devil sticks. The first time I 
did it I knocked over someones 
drink, he said. I used to [juggle] 
a little, but I was doing it wrong, 
he added. He has been able to 
learn a lot from the other mem
bers of the club.
Juggling is for everyone, 
Schoenberg said, hoping that stu
dents will feel free to stop by. It 
is not a special circus skill; any
one can learn it.

Moviehouse connoisseur rates local offeringsSuper Saver Cinema tops the list with an exciting atmosphere
By MEGAN DIETZ
Tartan Assistant News Editor
Editor's note: This is the first 
of a thise-part series, in which 
local tleaters are reviewed in 
searcher the best theater in the 
Pittsbigh area.
watching these previews, I find 
this practice very annoying. So I 
give this theater, which is exem
plary in every other way, from 
movie selection to decor, a rat
ing of four-and-a-half stars.
 Manor Theater, Murray 
Avenue, Squirrel Hill, 421-1633. 
(Prices are $3.50 before 6 pm, 
$6.00 after.) This Squirrel Hill 
theater, which plays two mov
ies, reminds me of my home
town of Ravenna, Ohio. We didnt 
have a movie theater there, but 
thats not the point.
The Manor has a small-town 
atmosphere that I just adore. 
Plus its right across the street 
from Eat n Park. The conces
sions are pretty mediocre, as are 
the screening rooms themselves, 
but its so laid back and relaxed 
that just walking under the oldstyle marquee and purchasing a 
ticket makes one remember Sun
day afternoon trips to the ice
cream shop with Mom and Dad. 
Those were the days. Four stars.
 Squirrel Hill Theater, 
Forward Avenue, Squirrel Hill, 
421-7900. (Prices are $3.50 be
fore 6 pm, $6.00 after) This the
ater, which plays three movies, 
will in my mind always be inex
tricably tied to the first movie I 
saw there, Silence of the Lambs. 
Because of that, this place is a 
little spooky for me, but for most 
people seeing a movie here 
should be a pleasurable experi
ence.
That is, unless youre one of 
the unfortunate souls who is 
forced to sit in the back of this 
theaters horribly-designed 
screening rooms. They are so 
long and narrow that the back 
half of the audience may need
To area high school students, going 
to the Super Saver seems to be the 
equivalent of attending fraternity 
parties at CMU.
Ah,the movies. Nothing can 
compire to the enormous feel
ing (f self-worth derived from 
stepjing up to the box office and 
utteing the words, One for 
Houard the Duck, please. Or 
the :lation of getting the concessioi person to put exactly the 
rigit amount of butter-flavored 
stuT on your popcorn.
iometimes it doesnt even 
matter if the movie is any good 
just sitting in the overstuffed 
sfflts and hogging two whole 
arnrests is experience enough, 
lowever, in order for this to 
lappen, the movie-house of 
hoice must have atmosphere, 
;harm, and distinct flavor to 
make the process of attending a 
movie there an enjoyable expe
rience.
But how is one supposed to 
make the important decision of 
whereto partake of an anxiouslyawaited movie when time is as 
limited as the seating at the 
Terminator 2 premiere? Read 
on, brave moviegoer. You have 
found your answer.
 Cinema World Monroe
ville, Monroeville Mall, 
Monroeville, 372-6145. (Prices 
are $3.50 before 6 pm, $6.00 
after.) This theater, located on 
the circular drive surrounding 
Monroeville Mall, shows four 
movies. Since its part of a large 
movie chain, popcorn, drinks,
opera glasses to see facial ex
pressions on the screen.
The concessions and atmo
sphere are nice, and the seats 
are comfortable, so I cant com
pletely knock this cinema. Its 
worth about three stars, but if 
the theater is crowded and its 
impossible to get a seat in the 
front half of the screening room, 
dont bother.
 Super Saver Cinema, 
Northway Mall on McKnight 
Road, North Hills, 367-1593. 
(Prices are $1.50 weekdays and 
Friday and Saturday before 6 
pm, $2.00 after 6 pm on Fridays 
and Saturdays.) This theater is 
everything a moviehouse should 
becheap, filthy, andloud. Oh, 
its great! The eleven secondrun movies it shows are dirtcheap, but they are all wellknown, and many of them are 
also showing at first-run the
aters (for triple the price). The 
concessions are okay, but the 
true strength of the cinema lies 
in its atmosphere.
The hallways leading to the 
theaters are decorated with 
strips of neon lights reminiscent 
of Buck Rogers, and the seats 
are very lumpy and uncomfort
able. Your feet may stick to the 
floor if you arent careful to move 
them around periodically, and 
so many people go there on week
end nights that one often has to
fight for the right to use ones 
ticket but thats half the fun.
The other half is listening to 
the various conversations 
around the theater as the movie 
begins. To area high school stu
dents, going to the Super Saver 
seems to be the equivalent of 
attending fraternity parties at 
CMU. The various pick-up lines 
and rebuffs heard before the 
movie were educational to me, 
and they punctuate the mood of 
the theater quite nicely. For 
those of you who are concerned 
about noise during the film, dont 
worry  this side-show enter
tainment dies down a few min
utes into the movie. But those 
with weak stomachs might want 
to come in a little late so they 
miss it.
This theater may sound like; a 
dump, but theres something 
about it that just makes it irre
sistible. I give it five stars, trashy 
though it may be.
Although it is hoped that this 
guide will prove useful to you in 
your quest for the perfect movie 
theatre, it should be noted that 
taste in cinemas, much like taste 
in the movies themselves, is 
purely a matter of opinion. So 
trust your instincts. And enjoy.
and candy selection are pretty 
standard. The screening rooms 
themselves are fairly newthe 
seats are comfortable and are 
arranged so that (unless Andre 
the Giant sits directly in front of 
you) everyone has a pretty good 
view of the screen. The sound 
system is good  loud but not 
overwhelming.
I guess Cinema World would 
deserve four stars on a five star 
scale. However, it has little, if 
any, personality. Its up-to-theminute pastel decorating scheme 
looks like it could be plopped 
down in the middle of any Ameri
can suburb, and the carpeting is 
plush and very nouveau. Every
one throws out their trash. The 
place is absolutely no fun.
In turn, the rating is lowered 
to three stars, because of the 
cinemas mediocre atmosphere. 
I would not enjoy seeing a bad 
movie here.
 Showcase Cinema East, 
William Penn Highway, 
Monroeville, 824-4424. (Prices
are $3.50 before 6 pm, $6.00 
after.) This moviehouse, affec
tionately known by some as the 
cinematic bunker, shows 
eleven movies. Its also a perfect 
example of how a movie theater 
can have style even when its the 
size and shape of a convention 
center.
A basketball throwing game 
and several video games amuse 
waiting theater-goers, as does 
the plentiful supply of compli
mentary movie magazines. The 
concession stand people will give 
you as much butter and salt as 
you want on your popcorn, and 
the candy, though overpriced, is 
fine. In the hallways leading to 
the individual screening rooms 
hang prints of artwork, all ofwhich are for sale. The screen
ing rooms again, being fairly 
new, are comfortable.
The only problem I have with 
this theater is that they dont 
turn off the lights until the pre
views are over. Being one of the 
many people who really enjoys

In England, Cliff found himself in the 
position of music pioneer, introducing 
the Brits to ska, bluebeat, and rock 
steady, all precursors of reggae. From 
there, Cliff was off to show the world 
his music.
In Brazil, Cliff won a song contest 
with his tune Waterfall which estab
lished him in the Brazilian market. 
After that, Cliffs career skyrocketed. 
His song Many Rivers to Cross was a 
big success, and has since been re
corded by Linda Ronstadt, UB40, Little 
Milton, and Stanley Turrentine. An
other of his songs, Trapped, was used 
by Bruce Springsteen after he heard it 
on the P.A. system in Heathrow Air
port. After hearing it, Springsteen 
tracked it down and used it in his live 
shows.
In 1972, Cliff combined his singing 
and acting talents by starring in and 
writing the soundtrack for the movie 
The Harder They Come. In the movie, 
Cliff plays Ivan, a singer who moves 
to Kingston from the countryside. This 
film, which paralleled parts of his own 
life, was the turning point in Cliffs 
career. It introduced reggae music to

JIMMY CLIFF. T|is Friday on the Cut at 
4:30 pm. Presented by Activities Board 
Concerts.
By JENNIFER TURNER
Tartan Junicr Staffwriter
This Friday the Activities Board will 
officially kick off this years concert 
events wit3l international superstar 
Jimmy Cliff performing on the Cut at 
4:30. Cliff, who has more than twenty 
albums and countless singles under his 
belt, is crpited with being one of the 
founders if modern-day reggae music.
Jimmy Cliff started on his career 
almost tfcirty years ago with his first 
recorded single Daisy Got Me Crazy. 
While Daisy Got Me Crazy was never 
release^, his second single, Hurricane 
Hattie, gained him folk-hero status in 
his viliage of Somerton, Jamaica. His 
musicatthe time was a precursor to the 
reggae style called ska.
After the release of Hurricane 
Hattie, C.liff was approached by record 
promoter Edward Seaga who wanted to
his eventual trip to Africa. Since then 
he has continued to gain popularity 
and rave reviews in America and 
abroad. And in 1985, Cliff was honored 
with a Grammy Award.
He has travelled with such bands as 
Francos OK Jazz, of Ensambo, Zaire, 
the International Band of Zaire, and 
the Grand Zico Band. His work with 
these bands has influenced his music, 
and African culture and religion are 
recurrent themes in his songs.
Recently, Cliff has returned to the 
silver screen in Club Paradise. His new
promote ska outside of the Caribbean. 
Cliff headlined as the star of the U.S. 
tour, and while the tour was not very 
successful, it earned Cliff some rave 
reviews which led to his signing with

the world and made Cliff a star in 
Europe, Africa, and Latin America, and 
gave him a foothold in the U.S.
Soon afterward, Cliff became inter
ested in African culture, which led to
album, Images, was released by Cliffs 
own newly-formed label Cliff Sounds 
and Films.
As Cliff makes his way into the nine
ties the future looks very bright. With
International superstar Jimmy Cliff.
all of his success and popularity, Cliff 
has greater control over his music and 
the direction he wants to go in. The

doubt live up to his past preformances 
and an event not to be missed.

L10The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  9 September 1991
Networks play it safe with this years crop
It used to be that fall was a 
very exciting time on TV. New 
programs would turn up all over 
the place, some good and many 
others bad. Still, it was some
what thrilling to witness this 
Annual event, complete with all 
the network fanfare and free 
publicity from TV Guide. Plus, 
ther.e was always bound to be at 
least one show that would take 
the viewing public by storm and 
^ault to the top of the Neils ons 
in its first season.
! But those days are over. The 
term rookie hit is outdated, 
and the networks are being much 
more cautious after getting 
burned in'the past couple of sea
sons. Hardly any new shows are 
premiering, and most of those 
re incredibly safe and not very 
exciting. Even TV Guide's, Fall 
Preview has become something 
of an anti-climax.
Still, there are some bright 
spots on the network schedules, 
and some shows that seem des
tined for hit status regardless of 
their quality. Here then, is an 
incomplete and generally quite 
biased look at the new fall offer
ings, along with my thoughts on 
how the season will progress.
Hits by Default. Two new 
AEG sitcoms, Home Improve
ment and Step by Step, will be 
helped greatly by their timeslots. 
Home Improvement (Tuesday at 
8:30 pm on WTAE), a family 
comedy about a TV handyman 
whos actually  get this  a 
real goofball at home, follows 
everyones favorite, Full House. 
And Step by Step (Friday at 8:30 
pm on WTAE), anupdatedSrarfy
THE LAUGH TRACK
by A. Franklin Wheeler
Bunch with Suzanne Somers 
and Patrick Duffy (you just knew 
it had to happen), is smack-dab 
in the middle of ABCs impen
etrable TGIF lineup. Even 
Baby Talk is a hit on this night.
Murder by Timeslot. At least 
three promising shows will be 
dead in a few months unless 
they are moved. NBCs Eerie, 
Indiana (Sunday at 7:30 pm on 
WPXI) is a seriocomic look at a 
really weird town through the 
eyes of two young boys. What 
was NBC thinking? It seems to 
me that all the people who might 
want to see this show will al
ready be tuned in to Parker Lewis 
Cant Lose on Fox.
Gary David Goldbergs nos
talgic look at growing up in the 
fifties, Brooklyn Bridge, is stuck 
in a tough timeslot on CBS (Fri
day at 8:30 pm on KDKA). It 
could possibly find a niche among 
an older audience, but Im bet
ting that CBS will try it on Sun
day or Monday night before 
seasons end.
And Til Fly Away (Tuesday at 
8 pm on WPXI), a heartwarming 
yet bittersweet look at the civil 
rights movement, will get 
pounded by Full House no mat
ter how good it is.
A Really Good Show. Yes, 
thats right, folks, there is one 
new program that is both fun to 
watch and bound to be popular. 
Its Roc (Sunday at 8:30 pm on 
WPGH), a Fox sitcom with all 
the right ingredients: likable 
characters, good actors who get 
along with each other, funny 
situations, and expert direction. 
This one will be around for 
awhile  and deservedly so.
Flashback. The Carol 
Burnett Show (Friday at 9 pm 
on KDKA) is back, and Im bet
ting it will be good. Shes been 
sorely missed. P.S. ILuv ^(Sat
urday at 10 pm on KDKA) is a 
flashback of another sort: a re
hash of bad seventies actionadventures. Not the worst way 
to pass an hour, but certainly 
not the most worthwhile either.
Stay Away. As always, theres 
a number of new entries that are 
possibly dangerous to our men
tal health. First off, theres Teech 
(Wednesday at 8:30 pm on 
KDKA), about a black teacher at 
an all-white private school. I 
dont even want to think about 
this one.
Then theres Hermans Head 
(Sunday at 9:30 pm on WPGH), 
where we get to see four personi
fied sides of Hermans personal
ity. Who among the Fox net
work programmers actually 
thought this would work?
And, of course, theres The 
Adventures of Mark & Brian 
(Sunday ap 7 pm on WPXI), 
where we, the viewing audience, 
get to watch two Los Angeles 
DJs make fools of themselves 
on national TV. Gee, I can only
think of a few thousand things 
Id rather do.
Finally, two of my favorite ac
tors, James Gamer and Robert 
Guillaume, are starring in two 
NBC sitcoms which look medio
cre at best: Gamers Man of the 
People (Sunday at 8 pm on WPXI) 
and Guillaumes Pacific Station 
(Sunday at 8:30 pm on WPXI). 
Wasting these two folks on these 
two shows is, in my opinion, the 
worst crime.
Best of the Rest. None of the 
remaining fall premieres stand 
out from the crowd, and chances 
are good that most of them will 
fail. Still, there are a few that 
may be worth looking at.
On the sitcom front, Redd Foxx 
returns to TV (with Della Reese) 
in The Royal Family (Wednes
day at 8 pm on KDKA), in what 
looks like a mildly entertaining, 
if fairly standard, show. Pro-, 
ducer Susan Harris brings us 
Nurses (Saturday at 9:30 pm on 
WPXI) and Good and Evil 
(Wednesday at 10:30 pm on 
WTAE) with Teri Garr. Harris 
shows signs of slipping with 
these two entries.
Dabney Coleman tries to find 
a hit yet again with Drexells 
Kids (Thursday at 8:30 pm on 
WPGH), in which he plays a 
nasty schoolteacher  doesnt 
look too promising. And Twiggy 
is among the stars of Princesses 
(Friday at 8 pm on KDKA), a 
comedy about three princesses 
trying to live together. Its Sis
ters without the laugh track or 
Babes without the bulkeither 
way, not a winner.
Marlee Matin stars in ReaAnd, of course, theres The 
E1nokluwoi eb UTw] ! "waTk& where 
we, the viewing audience, get le 
watch two Los Angeles DJs make 
fools of themselves on national TV. 
Gee, I can only think of a few 
thousand things Id rather do.
sonableDoubts (Friday at 10 pm 
on WPXI). Unfortunately, a wellknown actress does not a good 
drama make. Three other dra
mas, Homefront (Tuesday at 10 
pm on WTAE), Palace Guard 
(Friday at 10 pm on KDKA), and 
The Commish (Saturday at 10 
pm on WTAE), are similar in 
that none of them will find an 
audience.
Now its time for the big pre
dictions. The ratings winner? 
CBS, gaining momentum with 
new hits, not to mention the 
World Series and the Superbowl. 
The big loser? NBC, with its 
current hits getting old and no 
promising programs on the ho
rizon.
And finally, my annual pre
dictions on which shows will die 
by seasons end. Last fall, as 
some of you may remember, I 
successfully predicted the de
mise of 20 out of 30 programs. 
(Okay, so I was wrong about 
Beverly Hills 90120. So sue me.) 
This year, Im taking more 
chances, and Im even more con
fident that Ill be batting 1.000.

-Looking to escape the dizzy
ing pace of the 1990s? The 
Benedum Centers upcoming 
Broadway series offers a variety 
of musical period pieces that will 
sweep you away from campus 
life in Pittsburgh. Perhaps youd 
like to see France in the 1800s? 
Or maybe youve always wanted 
to go back to the fifties when 
rock n roll was born? If thats 
not exciting enough, you could 
travel to the seedy side of Los 
Angeles in the 1940s where 
steamy sex and suspicious 
deaths are par for the course. 
The Benedum Center has a show 
to satisfy any adventurous time 
traveller.
Bye, Bye, Birdie kicks off the 
new Broadway Series season 
with an all-American musical 
set in the early days of rock n 
roll, starring Tommy Tune and 
Ann Reinking. Tune, who re
cently won his seventh Tony 
award for his choreography in 
Grand Hotel, plays Albert
 Theater Preview 
Bye, Bye, :3irdie kicks off the season with its October 15-20 run at Heinz Hall. Keeping up the rockabilly tempo 
is Buddy: The Buddy Holly Story, which runs from November 26 to December 1 at Benedum Center. Les 
Miserabies makes its second appearance in Pittsburgh at Benedum Center from December 3 to 8. Joan 
Collins opens the 1992 half of the series in Noel Cowards Private Lives at Benedum Center from February 
4 to 9. If the CMUs halls of education have got you down, spend an evening at Benedum Center watching 
the education of Eliza Doolittle in My Fair Lady during its run at Benedum Center from March 3 to 8. In the 
mood for a good detective story, catch City of Angels doin time at Heinz Hall from May 19 to 24. Get caught 
up in a favorite childhood story when The Secret Garden comes to Heinz Hall from June 2 to 7. For more 
information and to order tickets call 456-2670.
Peterson, agent to the slightly 
dim teen-idol Conrad Birdie. The 
musical focuses on the furor that 
erupts when Birdie is drafted 
into the Army. While the show 
was originally intended as a 
spoof on Elvis Presley and his 
stint as a regular GI, the story 
also makes humorous state
ments about the music business 
in general.
Be sure to listen for some of 
the shows catchiest tunes, 
Kids!, Put on a Happy Face, 
and Got a Lot of Livin to Do. 
Bye, Bye, Birdie will be at Heinz 
Hall From October 15 to 20.
If Bye, Bye, Birdie just whet
ted your appetite for rock n roll,
dont miss the toe-tapping 
Buddy: The Buddy Holly Story. 
Buddy Hollys widow helped 
bring the sensational facts of 
the late singers life to the stage. 
The first half of the show re
counts the events that brought 
Holly fast, brief fame. From his 
first appearance at the Apollo 
where he and the Crickets man
aged to win over an all black 
audience, to Hollys fruitless at
tempts to keep his band together, 
the public gets a fresh and indepth look at the young stars 
life and character.
The second half of the show is 
a meticulous recreation of Hollys 
final concert with The Big 
Bopper (J.P. Richardson), 
Ritchie Valens, and Dion: Added 
details like ushers who hand out 
programs for the concert, and a 
door prize for one lucky ticketholder will make you feel like 
you too were in Clearlake Iowa 
in 1959. Buddy: TheBuddy Holly 
Story rocks into town on Novem
ber 26 and will stay until De
cember 1.
D o y ou ever wonder what Jo an 
Collins is doingnow? Well, heres
the scoop: shes starring in Noel 
Cowards Private Lives. In it she 
plays a woman who encounters 
her ex-husband while shes on 
vacation with her present hus
band and hes on vacation with 
his present wife. The dialogue 
becomes witty and sharp when 
the former spouses mn off to
gether. Catch this fling at the 
Benedum Center from Febru
ary 4 to 9.
Everyone loves a good rags-toriches story. Come witness 
Christopher Plummer as Pro
fessor Henry Higgins who trans
forms the guttersnipe Eliza
Doolittle into a lady. Based on 
George Bernard Shaws 
Pygmalion, 'My Fair Lady is 
considered the best of Alan Jay

arms and sails up into the sky 
and rolls his loins around like a 
cross between a golden eagle and 
a slave boy in a San Francisco 
porno act, and all the women in 
the audience instantly start 
thinking about divorce proceed
ings. Four points.
Finally, we get the real tra
peze act, then a Chinese lady 
that can spin umbrellas on her 
feet (they taught this in the Com
munist work camps, of course), 
and another Russian guy who 
can stand on his head on top of 
'eight chairs stacked up on a table 
while carrying a birthday cake. 
They do this all the time in 
Vladivostok.
And it turns outthis is very 
hard for me to admit  they 
even have a decent clown. A guy 
in a Charlie Chaplin suit who 
goes out in the audience looking 
for something and climbs up 
through the rows, destroying the 
wardrobes, hair-dos and self-re
spect of thirty or forty people. 
Now this is my kind of guy.
I kept waiting for the el
ephants. No elephants in this 
circus. How can you call it a 
circus without elephants being 
forced to do unnatural acts? Five 
points off.
They still scored in the posi
tive numbers, though. As long 
as I dont have to listen to em 
talk, yes, I admit, its a drive-in 
kind of circus.
And speaking of whips, chains 
and leotards, G. Gordon Liddy 
gets bent over a desk and pun
ished by a hooker in Street Asy
lum, this great Wings Hauser 
flick which is about a year old 
but Im reviewing it anyway be
cause it predicted and explained 
the whole beat-the-stuffingsout-of-the-black-guy incident in
a

THE DRIVE IN

hip bone or something. Five 
points. One of the wonders of 
western civilization.
More clown bull stuff. Only two 
points off, though, because this 
time they had a lifesize Miss 
Piggy with orange Jello on her 
head.
Next we get one of those Ko
rean seesaw acts where guys 
dress up like valet parkers at 
Caesars Palace and launch one 
another up in the air and then 
land on the shoulders of some 
junior-high-school dropout who 
agreed to stand at the bottom of 
the four-man spinal-compression flesh tower. Two points.
The tightrope act was fairly 
decent, especially the guy 
dressed up like Grandpa 
Munster. One point.
Then a stocky gal in one of 
those flesh-tone body suits that 
makes you look like youre 
nekkid did a trapeze solo where 
you dangle from your heels and 
fling yourself around like a sack 
of potatoes. Three points.
And then they bring out the 
first-half show-stopper: this 
Russian guy with oiled up 
muscles and a Tarzan breechcloth thats so tiny they might 
have just used a Magic Marker. 
And the Russky Tarzan wraps 
these leather straps around his
Whips, chains, and leotards, oh mv!!
Joe Bob visits
Joe Bob, youve gotta go to 
this circus....
Joe Bob, you have got to see 
this Montreal circus....
Joe Bob, this French circus is 
in town that you cant pronounce. 
You need to see this.
Sol finally went to the goldang 
thing, the Cirkay du Swan Lake 
or whatever you call it, and the 
first thing I notice is that the 
whole deal is in a tent, like God 
fended. One point for the 
Frenchies.
Next thing I notice is that my 
ticket is 37 bucks. Frenchies are 
back to zero.
Next, I see that were gonna 
have a whole bunch of clowns in

clowns. Three points off.

and colored smoke and geeching 
around by these clowns, we get 
the first act: four 14-year-old 
girls in pink leotards who can 
bend themselves into every 
shape in the Chinese alphabet. 
Now were talking circus. One 
girl could lie on her stomach, put 
her ankles on either side of her 
head, raise herself up on her 
elbows, twist her large intestine 
into the shape of a croissant, 
and do the multiplication tables 
with her left thigh. You had to 
see it. Some of these positions 
were so obscene people were say
ing, Naw, I dont think that's 
what were looking at. When she 
unfolds herself, itll just be her
circus, French style
El Lay this year.
G. Gordon Liddy did it! Hes 
the mastermind behind a secret 
elite El Lay police unit called
S.Q.U.A.D. (Scum Quelling Ur
ban Assault Division). Every 
time a cop gets wounded in the 
line of duty, they take the guy to 
the clinic and implant an elec
tronic super-hormone device in 
the small of his back, and then a 
Lipstick Lizard watches the cop 
on a monitor and juices him up 
whenever she feels like it, until 
the cop becomes a scum-wasting 
bug-eyed animal. Of course, 
sometimes the remote-controlled cops can get a little out of 
hand and start beating in the 
heads of pimps and drug dealers 
for no reason. G. Gordon doesnt 
care. Hes watching on cable.
Fortunately, Wings Hauser is 
the only one smart enough to 
finally say, You know what? I
think I have a mind-control de
vice planted in my back. And 
then he deals with it  by ask
ing his girlfriend to cut it out.
Yuk.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  9 September 1991
u2TT crV h2kVe provides some appealing tunes
By MIKE SHAPIRO
Tartan Senior Staffwriter
Rush fans are religious about their 
favorite band, speaking of Geddy Lee 
and Neil Peart in a reverent hush usu
ally reserved for addressing job inter
viewers or people over six feet tall. One 
is inclined to wonder what the fuss is all 
about.
.Fortunately for us non-diehard Rush 
fans, they have provided a perfect op
portunity for judgement in the form of 
their newest album, Roll The Bones.
;Rushs music isnt the sort that leaps 
up and grabs you by the earlobes. Just 
as Led Zeppelin sounds like a particu
larly rhythmic train accident to the 
uninitiated, Rush doesnt lend itself to 
Spontaneous appreciation.
; 'If this is the groups trademark, then 
Roll the Bones is another pea in the 
;hypothetical pod. Upon first listening,

youre likely to shrug. However, after 
the second or so playing, youll discover 
the subtle potency to the album that 
makes it all worthwhile.
The music is certainly distinctive, 
although perhaps not from other Rush 
songs. Geddy Lees elfin voice borders 
on the exotic, managing both strength 
and clarity as well as the unshakable 
impression that its about to crack like 
a teenage warble (it doesnt).
The musics strongest point is that 
its dynamic, rather than static. Guitar 
lines are robust and active, a pleasant 
oddity in a musical genre where most 
guitars sound like someone kicked a 
grizzly. Percussionlittle used in most
courtesy Atlantic Recording Corporation
music beyond keeping the band in time 
(if that)  is jumpy and kinetic, like 
something out of a quantum physics 
text.
The bass lines, which traditionally 
serve as musical backbones, give a sense 
of flexibility rather than rigidity, or
spinal atrophy.
Melodic strength is high, if not excep
tional. Theres a frustrating dovetail of 
inspired phrases with irritating aim
lessness. The title track is a perfect 
example: Most people may be so 
unimpressed with the jarring atonality 
of initial verses that they wont reach 
the full-bodied, almost spiritual cho
rus. Its as if the group conjured up 
some great musical ideas, but, impa
tient to get them recorded, surrounded 
them with hastily-written filler.
The lyrical recipe is one part cyni
cism and two parts foreboding, lightly 
seasoned with mild individualism and 
a sprinkle of whimsy. The songs are 
more connotation than denotation, with 
their literal meaning submerged be
neath layers of metaphor and poetic 
ambiguity.
However, most people dont give a 
hoot point five about lyrics so long as
they contain the proper number of syl
lables  and there really are some 
fiendishly clever rhymes here and there1.
Of the ten new tracks your MAC card 
will get you, a few stick out. Dreamline 
is an ode to the fragility of youthful 
ambition, and really shouldnt be lis
tened to by anyone not clear on their 
major. Bravado, for all its Daedalusian 
overtones, is a bit sluggish musically; 
Face Up is an upbeat if ambiguous 
call to arms. Neurotica pokes fun at 
the average, unfocused clod, with a 
compelling chorus.
If youre looking for something to put 
alongside Sgt. Peppers in your CD case, 
then go buy another copy of Sgt. 
Peppers. But if you want fairly innov& 
tive and appealing music thatll keeip 
you happy for a few weeks, and then 
occasionally afterwards, then Roll The 
Bones fills the office. And the album 
cover art is really cool.

.What theatergoers found was a 
witty piece about an author who 
watches helplessly as Hollywood 
executives turn his detective 
novel into a cheesy motion pic
ture. Written by M*A*S*H cre
mator Larry Gelbart, with words 
and music by David Zippel and 
Cy Coleman, the musical brings 
tWo worlds to life. One is the 
black-and-white world of the film 
. noir detective, Stone. The other 
world belongs to Stine, Stones 
creator, with its brightly colored, 
larger-than-life Hollywood char
acters. The smooth tunes, in
cluding a few numbers from the 
Sinatra-esque crooner Jimmy 
Powers, perfectly capture the
tone of the forties. Heinz Hall

Lawrence of Arabia
If youve never witnessed the epic adventure of 
British officer T.E. Lawrence and his spiritual 
struggle with his unknown destiny in the cin
ematic masterpiece Lawrence of Arabia, you now 
have the chance. Peter OToole stars in this stun
ning film as Lawrence, the man who helps unite 
. the varied tribes of Arabs and lead them against 
. the Turks during World War I.
Filled with breathtaking desert images, an in" triguing plot, and a myriad of original characters, 
Lawrence of Arabia is a tremendous accomplish
ment in filmmaking more than worthy of its seven 
Academy Awards and your time on a Thursday

Sleeping with the Enemy
Julia Roberts gives a convincing performance 
as the battered wife of an obsessed madman in 
Sleeping with the Enemy. Using an ingenious plan 
to escape the hell of her marriage, she kills her 
old life and attempts to start anew in a small town 
in Iowa. Her husband, played by Patrick Bergen, 
stalks her like a predator after its prey. The 
expressions of his rage and twisted love that 
border on insanity will send chills up your spine.
Although the plot tends to be predictable, the 
directing and filming are superb. Its well worth 
the buck and a few precious study hours.

New Jack City
Its nothing personal... just business. This allAmerican phrase takes a chilly, cynical twist in 
the action-packed, blockbuster hit New Jack City. 
The big business is the drug trade set up in the 
ghetto of a generic city in America, where you can 
die for just saying no. This upscale black mafia 
basically owns the neighborhood, even the cops. 
But there are two police that they dont own, and 
theyre ready to beat them down  thats when 
the action really starts.
Dramatic yet realistic performances come from 
rapper Ice-T, Judd Nelson, Mario Van Peebles (in 
his directorial debut), and the up-and-coming 
Wesley Snipes. Not only is this movie a must-see 
if you havent already, but a gotta-see-again if you 
have. And believe me, its worth your dollar, and 
a few hours of your time. So grab a few friends, 
flow with the New Jack swing of things, and go

The Godfather, Part II
Cast from the same mold, The Godfather, Part 
II continues right where Part I left off, opening 
with Michael Corleone right after his move out 
West to Las Vegas.
This film, which is as powerful and as exciting 
as the first, is the only one in history to win the 
Academy Award for Best Picture as a sequel to 
another Academy Award winner. Part II also 
features many from the original cast (A1 Pacino, 
Diane Keaton, and Talia Shire), and includes 
some scenes which were cut from the first Godfa
ther film in which Robert DeNiro plays a young 
Vito Corleone. These scenes are not only interest
ing to watch but really add to the storyline as they 
show Vitos climb from a poor immigrant orphan 
to his position as the Godfather. Robert DeNiro 
also won the Academy Award for Best Supporting 
Actor.
Scenes to watch for include Michael and Kates 
breakup, Alfredos slip-up, and the kiss of death. 
If you saw the first Godfather, then this sequel is 
a must-see. If you havent seen the first one, you 
can easily catch up. Believe me, you will get more 
than your dollars worth.

tVcU22T mTakli T swall mafluwo eb woTtal
In a literature class this past 
week, I happened to read a story 
by the great philosopher Plato, 
andit went something like this.... 
Once upon a time there were 
some men who were chained in a 
cave with their backs always 
facing the world outside, while 
their faces remained fixed fac
ing the wall of the cave. Behind 
them was a fire, and it would 
cast shadows and phantom-like 
figures of the world that they 
had no idea existed.
After a lifetime of staring at 
this wall believing this pathetic 
reality to be authentic, a man 
who had somehow freed himself 
from this torture approached the 
tragic figures and told them the 
news that these were but shad
ows of a true reality that they 
were ignorant of. Violently the 
cave men struggled to break free 
from their chains, hoping that 
they would be liberated from 
their bondage. Through violence 
these men hoped to understand 
a reality that is inconceivable.
Strangely enough, I began to 
see a parallel between this myth 
and a comic book that began its 
run approximately six months 
ago. In Ted McKeevers 
Metropol, a select group of cave 
men are also freed from the 
chains that bind them, and are 
given a task that may seem over
whelming to common cave dwell
ers like us. The prophecies of a 
war in Heaven have come true, 
with the exception that it is be
ing waged in McKeevers me
tropolis. But theres a lot more 
to this rather trite premise than 
meets the eye.
The absurdity of the Platonian 
cave mans reality, and the par
allels with our own give the char
acters of McKeevers Metropol 
an endearing yet disquieting 
charm. His characters are nor
mal people, grating through the 
motions of life, staring at shad
ows on the wall. They are disil
lusioned, horribly normal-lookCOMIC RELIEF

ing people, and in them it is 
painfully easy to see reflections 
of our own lives.
The imprisoned cave men, 
while fighting their steel bonds, 
are consumed with doubts. Is 
there indeed another world that 
exists, a world that they have 
been sadly denied, or are they 
the victims of a cruel joke? Does 
God exist? Is there a spiritual 
reality of which they have, only 
seen shadows created by the fires 
of ambivalent faith? The violence 
with which the cave men 
struggle to shatter their chains 
is very much like the grinding 
determination which drives our 
own lives. It is a hopeless 
struggle limited by the rules of a 
game we cannot hope to under
stand. Wouldnt it be amazing if 
someone from outside the cave 
came upon us and unlocked the 
chains, held our hands and 
showed us what the real world 
is like?
Five people in the Metropol 
have been granted this gift. The 
absurdity of their routine lives 
is heightened by tragic, inexpli
cable circumstances. The book 
focuses on a Joe Shmoe figure 
who, in an all too familiar Kafkan 
way, is arrested for a serious 
crime, the nature of which is 
never revealed. Echoes of divine 
injustice highlight the bitter, 
pitiful nature of mortal life.
He later succumbs to the mys
terious plague which has con
sumed the city, causing the 
deaths of thousands. He dies in 
prison, but is reborn as Enoch, 
one of five angels who will wage
1991 Ted McKeever
Filled with gripping artwork and novel ideas is the comic Metropol
apocalyptic war against the de
mons. The demons, too, are oncenormal people who have been 
reborn after leading selfish, nar
cissistic lives of self-pity.
The angels arent very angelic, 
however; they are jaundiced 
symbolic figures toting heavy ar
tillery against the carnal per
sonifications of darkness. They 
struggle with the loss of iden
tity, the sacrifice of their hu
manity for a divine cause. 
They pine for memories of their 
former lives, for sneakers and 
chocolate milk with frosted 
flakes.
Its in these bittersweet mono
logues that McKeevers opti
mism regarding the human con
dition comes through. By losing 
what they once took for granted, 
the angels begin to appreciate 
the lives that seemed once upon 
a time.to have so little meaning.
But these are subtle issues
intertwined with the strong, con
crete issues of an apocalyptic 
war. It occurs in a realistic set
ting over a period of time. The 
book is filled with haunting 
prophecies, macabre hints, and 
novel ideas. If you have often 
wondered what the end of the 
world will be like, Metropol 
paints a gripping, tantalizing 
picture. It is filled with puzzles, 
nonsensical scenes, and offbeat 
artwork that accentuates me 
uniqueness of this book. Hope
fully it will not fall into the easy 
trap of self-parody that its TV 
soulmate Twin Peaks collapsed 
into. Enjoy the weirdness.
