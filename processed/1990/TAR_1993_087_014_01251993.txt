Student assaulted
By KENDRICK K. CHUA
Tartan News Editor
At 1:40 am Sunday morning, a female CMU student 
was the victim of a rape, according to preliminary Cam
pus Police reports.
While walking alone on Frew Street towards Baker 
Hall, the student was assaulted by three unidentified 
men who were walking in the opposite direction. The 
student was taken forcibly by the men, one of whom 
wielded a butterfly knife, into Schenley Park. There she 
was raped by two of the men while the third acted as a 
lookout.
The student reported the incident at approximately 4 
am to Campus Police, whereupon she was trasnported to 
Magee Womens Hospital for treatment of injuries.
In a statement, Chief of Campus Police James LaPaglia 
said, This incident certainly points out that no matter 
how safe we think our campus is, there is always the 
possibility of being a victim of a crime. We [Campus 
Police] would urge people not to walk alone at night.
LaPaglia said that nightly patrols were being increased 
as a result of the incident. Plans were previously under
way to establish a student escort service across campus. 
This latter plan was introduced by Student Government 
President Natalie Gesmond at the last Student Senate 
meeting.
Dean Michael Murphy, while declining to comment on 
particular details of the incident, expressed his agree
ment with LaPaglias concerns, and said he encouraged 
students to take advantage of Campus Police services.

Six Student Senators resign
By FRANK MICHELS
Tartan Assistant News Editor
Student Senate started the spring semester with only two 
vacancies. However, by the meeting this Tuesday, there will 
be eight vacant Senate seats. At last Tuesdays Senate meet
ing, five Senators officially resigned and one Senator an
nounced his imminent resignation from their elected offices, 
mostly because of unforeseen conflicts and time constraints.
A major loss comes from the resignation of CFA Senator 
Moneet Singh, who served on Student Senate for three 
semesters. Singh said, There are certain organizations that 
are critical to life on campus. Those organizations that have 
a big impact get a big return. But for now, Student Senate is 
not one of those organizations. It is difficult to put so much 
into it without getting a big return.
Singhs last contribution to Student Senate was his pro
posal for a separate Human Resources Committee, which 
passed by a vote of 212-0. On the subject of human resources, 
Singh said, Senate shouldnt be about three or four individu
als, but about 30 people who decide on issues to benefit the 
campus.
CIT Senator Jonathan Kline also had to resign from Stu
dent Senate but for academic reasons. I had to prioritize 
between Naval ROTC, swimming, academics, and Senate, 
said Kline. Senate was at the bottom. He said that in the 
freshmen year of a typical Senator, Senate is not bad, but by 
the sophomore and junior year, there is too much work to 
spend time on Student Senate." Kline described Student 
Senates mcgor problem as not being representative of the 
student body but of the three percent who [vote]. However, 
Kline said of CIT Senator Greg Haverlcamp, chair of Student 
Senate, Hell do a good job running meetings and keeping 
order ... but with CMU being academically intensive, the

CMU Administration plans destruction of Skibo
By KENDRICK K. CHUA
Tartan News Editor
Skibo is coming down....
Maybe.
According to Edward Schatz, project manager 
for the University Center, the next step in the 
construction of the new build
ing after the completion of 
the new tennis courts is the 
tearing down of the Skibo 
building, which is scheduled 
to disappear before the fall 
93 semester begins. If the 
funding is in place, which it 
is not totally at this time,
Skibo will probably begin to 
come down in the month of 
June, said Schatz, who said 
Skibo would remain for an
other school year if funding 
is not available. Schatz said 
that information on funding 
would be more definite by 
February.
Presently the schedule for 
the University Center consists of 30 months of 
construction from June 1, 1993, according to 
Schatz. He estimated that student organizations
would be able to move into their new offices by 
the fall of 1995.
In the interim period, Schatz confirmed that 
most student organizations would be housed in 
the Naval building between the University Com
puting Center and the Heinz School building. If 
the destruction of Skibo remains as scheduled, 
the move to the Naval center 
would happen over the summer. 
Schatz said that the process for 
gettingtheNaval buildingis un
der way. Schatz also said that 
computer networking would be 
installed in the building but gave 
no date.
Tennis court construction is 
scheduled to end by July 1. 
Schatz said that the six courts 
would be located slightly south 
of the original position between 
two retaining walls whose pur
pose would be to support large 
amounts of soil.
Also, the walkway along the 
south edge of Resnik and West 
Wing residence halls would be 
extended in a straight line all the way to the cut. 
The courts are being put on a new foundation 
with new lighting and improved drainage.
Senate creates separate 
Human Resources committee
By FRANK MICHELS
Tartan Assistant News Editor
At Tuesdays Student Senate 
meeting, an amendment to the 
Student Body Bylaws separating 
the Public Relations/Human Re
sources Committee (PR/HR) into 
two independent committees was 
passed by a vote of 21-2-0. H&SS 
Senator Ann Kopchik was elected 
as chair of the new Human Re
sources Committee andappointed 
CFA Senator Jim Albert as vice 
chair. The amendment, proposed 
by former CFA Senator Moneet 
Singh, added the Human Re
sources Committee as a separate 
committee and explicitly defined 
its duties.
The Human Resources Com
mittee has two basic responsi
bilities, accordingto Singh. First, 
recordkeeping and maintenance 
refers to the Human Resource 
Committees responsibility to 
take records of Student Senate 
proposals, which include expla
nations as to what and why deci
sions were made, said Singh. He 
said that the records would there
fore assist in mak
ing related deci
sions in future Stu
dent Senate meet
ings as well as mak
ing these records 
easily accessible.
Second, person
nel management is 
a critical responsi
bility that encom
passes training,
Roberts Rules of Or
der, and the Bylaws.
This [duty] allows 
Senators to interact 
in a non-confrontational way, said 
Singh.
PR chair Shawn 
Knight belie ves that 
the amendment cre
ates a lesser bur
den on the Public 
Relations chair by 
promoting better re

William J. Clinton sworn in as 42nd President of U.S.
' WASHINGTON, January 20 
(AP)  President Bill Clinton 
summoned the nation to help a 
rlew generation ofleadership face 
hard truths and take strong 
stepB.... We will not shrink from 
the challenges nor fail to seize 
the opportunities.
Clinton made his inaugural re
marks juBt minutes after his 
wearing in as the U.S.s 42nd 
president.
Let us begin with energy and 
hope, with faith and discipline, 
and let us work until our work is 
done, Clinton said in the pre
pared text of his address. It was a 
flowery, flourishing speech that 
repeated his successful campaign 
themes, but as is traditional, con
tained no new initiatives.
' The new President pledged to 
uphold the U.S.s global commit
ments, having said When our 
vital interests are challenged, or 
the will and conscience of the 
ihternational community defied,
we will actwith peaceful diplo
macy when possible, with force 
when necessary. The brave 
Americans serving our nation in 
the Persian Gulf, in Somalia, and 
wherever else they stand are tes
tament to our resolve.
The 46-year-old Bon of Hope, 
Arkansas, paid tribute to his pre
decessor, George Bush, for a halfLet us begin with energy

century of public service. In a line 
reminiBcentof JohnF. Kennedys 
1961 inaugural, Clinton said it 
was time for a new generation to 
accept the mantle of U.S. and 
global leadership.
Today a generation raised in 
the shadows of the Cold War as
sumes new responsibilities in a 
world warmed bythesunBhineof 
freedom but threatened still by 
ancient hatreds and new 
plagues, said Clinton.
The newly elected President 
commented on the current status 
of global crises and said that the
______________ U.S. economy
wouldbe his first 
priority.
The first 
Democrat elect
ed President in 
12 years, Clin
ton said that the 
Presidency and 
Congress should 
give this capi
tal back to the people to whom it 
belongs, referring to the voters 
who elected him. Clinton also 
Bpoke on problems such as soar
ing budget deficits and health 
care costs, a fragile economy, glo
bal competition, and even voter 
cynicism about their govern
ment, which are seen by political 
analysts as obstacles to the suc
cess of the Presidency.
To renew America, we must 
be bold, Clinton said. We must 
do what no generation has had to 
do before. We must invest more 
in our own people and in our own 
future and at the same time, cut 
our massive debt. And we must 
dosoinaworldin which we must 
compete for every opportunity. 
In a direct appeal for sacrifice, 
he said, Let us put aside per
sonal advantage so that we can 
feel the pain and see the promise 
of America.
It is time to break the bad 
habit of expecting something for 
nothing, from our government or 
from each other. Let us take more 
responsibility, not only for our
selves and our families but for 
our communities and our coun
try, said Clinton.
Iraq accuses U.S. of falsifying information
BAGHDAD, January 22 (AP)  Iraqi officials said the latest 
air incident in northern Iraq was fabricated because there 
were no air defense batteries east of Mosul, the Iraqi News 
Agency reported.
As reported earlier by news services, the U.S. said the Iraqi 
surface-to-air missile radar had attempted to track a U.S. F-4G 
fighter and an F-16 flying over the northern no-fly zone near 
the city of Mosul.
The F-4G fired one missile, U.S. officials said.
It was the second such incident in two days following the cease
fire declaration by President Saddam Husseins government 
late Tuesday in a show of goodwill to the new administration 
of President Bill Clinton.
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed Al-Sahhaf sum
moned foreign ambassadors and told them that Iraq had not 
provoked yesterdays attack and had not violated the cease-fire.
He said the attack yesterday was an attempt by some Ameri
can circles who do not want the Iraqi initiative to succeed, 
according to an evening news broadcast.
Despite the provocative incident, Iraq will continue to ob
serve the cease-fire in order to allow the new American President 
to reconsider his countrys position toward Iraq, he was quoted 
as saying.
An unnamed Foreign Ministry spokesman said U.S. cluster 
bombs had set ablaze a fertilizer storage area and damaged 
crops, but there were no casualties suffered by Iraqi civilians in 
yes-terdays air attack.
Some foreign diplomats said they doubted that Baghdad 
authorities would deliberately undermine Iraqs position by 
provoking allied attack and said that Saddams government 
appeared sincerely interested in better relations with the U.S.

Former Chief Justice dies
By FRANK MICHELS
Tartan Assistant News Editor
At 2 pm yesterday, former Chief Justice Thurgood Marshall, the 
first black member of the Supreme Court, died of heart failure at 
Bethsda Naval Medical Center in suburban Maryland, according to 
the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. He was 84 years old.
Thurgood Marshall was bom on July 2, 1908, in Baltimore, 
Maryland. He graduated from Lincoln University in 1930 and 
received hiB law degree from Harvard Law School in 1933, where he 
graduate at the top of his class. Remaining in Baltimore, he 
practiced law privately until 1940, when he became chief of the 
legal-defense section of the National Association for the Advance
ment of Colored People (NAACP).
In 1954, Marshall argued for and won his most famous case. Brown 
vs. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas overturned the sixty-year 
doctrine of separate but equal, with which the court justified school 
segregation.
President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Marshall as solicitor 
general of the United States in July 1965, and in June 1967, he 
nominated him to the Supreme Court.
On June 27,1991, Marshall quietly retired after 25 years on the 
Supreme Court.

Desert Flower protests return of H&SS professor
By JASON TOGYER
Tartan Staffwriter
Desert Flower, a group of peace activ
ists led by Vince Eirene and Glenn 
Grodin, held a press conference on Janu
ary 18 at the Hewlett Galleiy in the CFA 
building, protesting the return of pro fessor Stephen Fienberg to the Univer
sity. Eirene called Fienberg a mission
ary for CMU, the military, and military 
contractors.
The group claims that Fienberg left 
his position as dean of the College of 
Humanities and Social Sciences to de
velop what it calls a base for American 
military contractors at York University 
in Toronto.
Peter Stearns, H&SS dean, finds the 
accusations leveled at Fienberg fairly 
insulting.
I didnt always agree with what he 
did as dean, although I thought he did a 
good job, said Steams. I view the press 
reports coming out ofYork as scurrilous. 
He is not a darling of the Defense De
partment. I hope that the press reports 
that surfaced in Toronto wont gain much 
ground here. It doesnt reflect all the 
work hes done.
Desert Flower has repeatedly pro
tested what it calls the Software Engi
neering Institutes (SEIs) seemingly 
endless pursuit of more and more mili
tary contracts and alleges that Fienberg 
was recruited by York to establish a 
space/military lab similar to CMUs SEI.
I would assume that there will not be 
a change [when Fienberg returns], said 
Eirene, and that he will continue to 
encourage military contractors at CMU 
and SEI.
It became clear to us that he was 
going to encourage the construction of a 
space-military lab up there, saidEirene.
It is a persistent, malicious campaign 
against me simply because I happen to 
disagree with what they believe in, said 
Fienberg in a telephone interview from 
California.
Fienberg was Yorks vice-president of 
academic affairs. He says his job was 
similar to that of provost and that he 
was responsible for overseeing approxi
mately two-thirds of Yorks budget.
I left CMU in order to be vice-presi
dent for academic affairs in my home 
city and to help a university that sought 
me out, said Fienberg, who was bom 
and raised in Toronto.
He resigned from York after only one 
year there amid controversy over his 
management style and his plans for the 
university. Critics charged he had a 
highly intrusive management style and 
that he was recruited from CMU for the 
conversion ofYork from a humanitiesoriented undergraduate school into an 
industry-oriented campus with a strong 
emphasis on contract research...[and] 
industrial technology. Yorks student 
newspaper,Ba:caZ/6ur,quotedYorkFederation of Students president Nikki 
Gershbain as saying Feinberg showed 
little interest in consulting with stu
dents. From my understanding, he was 
a hardline manager with a focus on the 
bottom line, she said.
Fienberg said that he was in frequent 
contact with the student body at York. I 
lived for a year in a graduate student 
residence, he said. I spent a lot of time 
with students because I believe in qual
ity undergraduate education.
I was [the history department] head 
while he was dean, and I didnt find him 
intrusive, Stearns said.
Fienberg was a member of the advi
sory board to SEIs Software Process 
Program from 1988 until his departure 
in the summer of 1991. I was involved 
with the improvement of software, said 
Fienberg, and that software was pro
mulgated widely ... to corporations and 
to other universities.
In September of 1991, it was an
nounced that York University had en
tered a bid to become the home of the 
International Space University (ISU), a 
space-research program which had its 
origin in a summer technology session 
at the Massachusetts Institute of Tech
nology in 1986. ISU had held summer 
sessions at a number of cities, but had no 
permanent home. ISUs proponents say 
that it would be a degree-granting insti
tution, devoted to activities involving 
peaceful space exploration. Its detrac
tors charge that it is merely a tool of 
American defense contractors intended 
to conduct top-secret military research.
I have been a supporter of ISU, 
Fienberg said, it is an institution devotedto the peaceful exploration of space. 
This is part of its charter, and added 
that Yorks faculty senate overwhelm
ing endorsed bringing ISU to Toronto.
In an interview with Torontos Now 
Magazine, Phillip Lapp, a member of 
the board of directors at York, said [ISU] 
doesnt do any research at the moment. 
I dont think its likely there will be any. 
And it certainly isnt our intention to 
introduce any kind of military compo
nent ... with peace breaking out every
where.
In fact, to get themselves started, 
they will take contracts from everyone, 
Eirene said, including military contrac
tors.
Fienberg's detractors woro galvanized 
in early 1992 when it was announced 
that he was one of threo finalists being 
considered for the job of Yorks presi
dent. Opposition to his appointment to 
the office came to a head in April when 
Excalibur published an investigative 
report about his background. The article 
charged that Fienbergs goal was a 
money making big-business York[in
volving] a major military and arms in
dustry presence on campus... and in the 
balance sheets.
The article, titled Stephen Fienbergs 
Corporate York, claimed that Fienbergs 
goal was to turn the university into a 
private, profit-making corporation, like 
its U.S. counterparts, a training cen
ter for multinational [corporations].
I have never done classified military 
research. I have never had or applied for 
a security clearance, and the allegations 
that I attempted to bring military re
search to York is patently false, said 
Fienberg. There is basic research fund
ing from the Department of Defense 
that is as clean and unsullied as any 
other research money.
Even if thats true, said Eirene, he 
went to another country, to another uni
versity, singing the praises of SEI.
The Excalibur article quoted uniden
tified sources at CMU as saying that 
Fienberg had a heartless approach to 
budgeting and that he prefered con
tract research over teaching and advo
cated budget cuts based on the costeffectiveness of departments and close
ties with the business community. 
[CMU was] restructured and transi 
formedinto an efficient, profit-maximiz? 
ing corporation," tho article read in part. 
This meant tho elimination of unprofit
able departments like Fino Arts and the 
trimming of faculty and swelling of class 
sizes in other non-revenue producing 
areas.
I liko to joke that the article in 
Excalibur had two things correct: the 
spelling of my namo and the fact that I 
was associated with Carnegie Mellon,? 
Fienberg said. I no longer give inter
views to Excalibur because what I say 
has no effect on what they print.
Some of these self-righteous, 
proclaimers of truth at York have never, 
checked the facts.
I have heard no examples of heartless, 
budgeting, Steams said, In fact, he 
allowed an increase in graduate stipends 
in the History Department.
York was $10 million in deficit when. 
I arrived, said Fienberg. We balanced 
the budget last year.
Opposition was led by a group ofYork 
professors called Faculty Concerned 
About Yorks Future, which viewed ISU 
as a turning point for York which would 
change the university from a diverse, 
balanced academic institution into one 
where private sector researchers would 
hold sway.
Steams said that Fienberg is techni
cally a member of the faculty, but is not 
on the payroll. When he returns this 
summer, he will be a chaired professor 
in the Statistics Department.
I left CMU reluctantly, said Fienberg. 
Im looking forward to coming back... I 
think its a terrific university."

4The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  25 January 1993
Student organizations participate in Roe vs. Wade anniversary events
By MIKE KEATING
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Two campus organizations, the 
Association for Life and the Cam
pus Association for Reproductive 
Rights (CARR), participated in 
events observing the twentieth 
anniversary of Roe vs. Wade on 
Friday, January 22. While nei
ther group dem onstrated publicly 
on campus, neither let the day go 
unnoticed. A group of 10 mem
bers of the Association for Life 
traveled to Washington, D.C., to 
take part in the 19th annual 
March for Life. They will also 
attend various pro-life confer
ences in the area.
CARR has plans of a more local 
nature for observing the anniver
sary. While some members par
ticipated in a rally at the Univer
sity of Pittsburgh, the primary 
activity planned is the showing of 
an HBO documentary Abortion: 
Desperate Decisions. The show
ing will be open to the whole 
campus, and is projected for two 
weeks from now.
The .Roe vs. Wade decision, and 
its potential for ambiguity, split 
concerned citizens into the pro
life and pro-choice factions. Over 
the past 20 years many groups 
have been drawn into the debate, 
including religious denomina
tions, political parties, and 
smaller local groups such as 
CMUs Association for Life and 
feARR.
 The Association for Life, led by 
do-chairs Aileen Connolly, senior
biology and psychology miy or, and 
Mark Sanders, junior psychology 
and applied history major, is a 
group of aboutl5 active members 
and as many as 40 associate mem
bers. Founded three years ago, 
the organization has had a rough 
time on a campus that both pro
life and pro-choice groups de
scribe as largely pro-choice.
A lot of the campus is either 
apathetic or pro-abortion. Its like 
its not cool to be pro-life, said 
Sanders, adding that If theyre 
not with us, theyre against us. 
To be against the pro-life move
ment is to be pro-abortion. 
Weve had quite some opposi
tion, said Connolly. She claims 
that the group has also had to 
work against some problems con
cerning coverage. The coverage 
is improving, though. We appre
ciate being covered.
Sanders has participated in a 
march on Washington once be
fore. The place was just packed. 
There must have been 100,000 at 
least. Various news sources have 
estimated that this years march
ers numbered nearly 75,000. The 
following will give you an idea of 
how biased the media is against 
the pro-life movement, says 
Connolly. In this mornings Post 
Gazette, the sponsors ofthe March 
for Life were quoted as saying 
there were approximately 
250,000 people there, the largest 
turnout in 20 years. The National 
Park Service grossly underesti
mated the number of people at
tending the march when they
claimed 75,000 were there.
CARR is coordinated by junior 
Rebecca Livingston. Operating 
out of the Womens Center, mem
bers participate in a variety of 
activities, such as conducting 
fund-raisers for the Clara Bell 
Duvall foundation and escorting 
women at abortion clinics. 
Livingston acknowledges that the 
campus is largely pro-choice, call
ing it moderate to liberal. Most 
people are pro-choice, but pro
lifers and conservatives are very 
outspoken.
Livingston is outspoken as 
well. She describes the pro-life 
movement as somewhat femi
nist, butnotentirely... The move
ment is made up of people who 
want the government out of our 
lives. She also says that the pro
life movement starts with young 
girls, poor women. They take 
away their rights. By the time 
other womens rights are in dan
ger, it will be too late to stop it. 
[The pro-life movement] is slowly 
chipping away at our power.
With the new Clinton adminis
tration, both groups are antici
pating changes. On Friday, 
Clinton made several controver
sial decisions: lifting the bans on 
counseling about abortion in federally-funded clinics, on the RU486 abortion pill, and on the use 
of aborted fetal tissue for re
search.
Understandably, the two cam
pus groups hold very different 
opinions of the upcoming admin
istration. The Reagan-Bush
years were very goodfor us, said 
Sanders. Clinton could wipe out 
12 years of work in a few days.... 
If there are pro-lifers out there, 
now is the time to stand up for 
what you believe. In a few years 
who knows what can happen? 
Connolly echoed this, saying, I 
hope that the pro-lifers come out 
and support us. Join in our fight.
Livingston is optimistic. I 
think [the abortion issue] is the 
one thing hes not going to back 
down on. I expect him to fulfill all 
of his promises in four years. We 
cant lose. I do expect more pro
life groups to become more vio
lent and aggressive. I think its 
going to get more sickening.
In 1973, the Supreme Court 
handed down a 6-3decision which 
declared thatthe rightofa woman 
to have an abortion was protected 
constitutionally.
This decision was not without 
its restrictions. The state could 
interfere with an abortion for 
moral reasons, to protect the 
womans health, or to protect po
tential life. Also, the decision set 
up regulations that changed with 
each trimester of a womans preg
nancy. During the first trimes
ter, the state could not legally 
interfere in any way with an abor
tion. Duringthe second, the state 
had the power to interfere only to 
protect the womans health. Dur
ing the third trimester (the time, 
said the court, at which the fetus 
was capable of independent life), 
the state had the power to re
strict abortions altogether.
Senate creates new committee
SENATE from page 1
the campus media, sol assigned 
[Singh] to work on the work
shops and Senator relation
ships.... Now, the Human Re
sources Committee [is respon
sible for] the planning of work
shops and the improving of 
Senator relationships.
MCS Senator Michael Tomblyn, vice-chair of Student Sen
ate, describes the Human Re
lations Committee as a great 
new committee [that is] really 
necessary.
At the Senate meeting, he 
said he was pleased to see that 
Senators have kept an open 
mind on the issue. I was very 
glad that a few members [of 
Senate] changed their votes 
after listening to fellow Sena
tors. Im glad they had an open 
mind enough to change their 
votes, he said.
CIT Senator Burt Holzman, 
chair of Campus Affairs, was 
one of the Senators who 
changed his vote from no to 
yes. He said that when he 
heard about the separation for 
the first time, it sounded to him 
like a waste of resources. 
After the discussion, 
Holzman said, several impor
tant points changed my mind. 
Human Resources wouldintroduce new Senators during the 
transition, since I have seen 
the confusion ofnew Senators.... 
I kept an open mind. 
However, one of the two nega
tive votes came from MCS 
Senator Yamam Fadl, chair of 
Academic Affairs. She said, At 
first, I thought it wasnt bad at 
all. But what about Student 
Senate in the future? There is 
a strong interest in Human 
Resources now, but Senators 
in the long run may find it not 
reliable.
Fadl also said that she would 
want it to remain as one com
mittee with Public Relations. 
We need more people who are 
willing to work for it.
CIT Senator Rob Evans cast 
the other vote against the Hu
man Resources Committee 
amendment but could not be 
reached for comment.
As for the success of the new 
Human Resources Committee, 
according to Tomblyn, The 
next two semesters will dic
tate what the committee does 
and what its identity is. Well 
see it as one of the most impor
tant parts ofStudent Senate.... 
We feel that it wont only ben
efit Student Senate but the 
campus community as a 
whole.
Knight agrees that the Hu
man Resources Committee will 
work. There is no doubt that 
under [Kopchik and Spauld
ing], Human Resources will get 
off to a good start. It will be a 
respected committee, and there 
will be Senators who will want 
to join it, said Knight. People 
will be glad it exists.
CMU establishes commission to investigate minorities
By HEIDI HOOVER
!Tartan Contributing Editor
 A Commission on the Status of 
tJnderrepresented Minorities at 
Carnegie Mellon, which formed last 
spring, hopes to complete a final report 
by next fall, according to co-chairs 
Everett Tademy, director of equal op
portunity programs, and Joe Trotter, 
professor of history. The commission is 
Studying the situation of four minority 
groups at CMU  Blacks, Hispanics, 
Asians, and Native Americans.
\ Provost Paul Christiano and Univer
sity President Robert Mehrabian gave 
the commission its charge: to update 
nd assoss information on the status of 
Underrepresented minorities at CMU, 
Examine to what extent the needs of 
linorities arc being met or are not being 
met, develop plans for attracting minor
ity students to CMU, and develop rec
ommendations for implementing the 
plans.
 The commissions scope is limited to
racial minorities because the issues fac
ing these groups are complicated enough 
without trying to cover groups such as 
gays, lesbians, and bisexuals or reli
gious minorities like Jews, said the co
chairs. It will, however, address the is
sues facing these groups within the con
text of its charge. We dont exclude any 
issues, such as sexual orientation or 
anti-Semitism, said Trotter, but look 
at them within the framework of [their 
effect on racial minorities].
For example, said Tademy, the prob
lems faced by a gay black man are differ
ent than those faced by a heterosexual 
black man, and the commission wants to 
examine both situations. Some find
ings, I think, will be transferable in the 
sense of valuing differences as well, he 
said. Spxual orientation, he believes, is a 
subject for a future commission.
The commission was first set up last 
spring by Mehrabian and Christiano. 
The president and the provost have 
said, This is something we want to see 
happen, so we feel like theyre really
behind it, said Trotter. He said the 
commission currently comprises about 
24 members who represent faculty, staff, 
and students. Members of the minori
ties being studied are included, but mem
bers of the majority also sit on the com
mission, and there is a good mix of men 
and women, he said.
We want to see an expansion of own
ership of this issue in the campus com
munity climate, said Tademy. This 
shouldnt be just a minority issue.
Last spring Tademy and Trotter gath
ered data to pick out trends in minority 
enrollment at CMU. They found that in 
the late 1960s and early 1970s there was 
a strong upturn in minority recruitment 
and a higher minority presence on cam
pus. In the 1980s, however, there was a 
downturn.
Tademy and Trotter arent sure why 
this trend occurred, whether economic 
changes in the U.S., the campus atmo
sphere, or other factors caused it. Tademy 
emphasized, however, that the entire 
University was behind the importance
of issues involving minorities in the 
1960s.
Complicating the issue farther is the 
fact that changes in minority status have 
varied in degree and effect for the differ
ent minorities, and also for the different 
populations  staff, faculty, and stu
dents.
Three subcommittees formed and be
gan to collect information. Each sub
committee is examining a different popu
lation  one focuses on faculty, one on 
staff, and one on students. They have 
been collecting statistics from the testi
mony of members of the campus commu
nity who come forward confidentially.
Each subcommittee studies the mi
nority presence in its assigned popula
tion, the roles members of minorities 
play in professional and academic cam
pus activities, and the ways members of 
minorities are assigned and promoted 
at Carnegie Mellon.
The commission originally projected 
last December as the completion date 
for the subcommittee reports, but the
subcommittees have been inundated 
with information, and need more time to 
analyze the raw data. As we go through 
the process, said Tademy, each action 
we take opens more questions and en
genders more action.
Otto Davis, the W.W. Cooper Univer
sity Professor of Economics and Public 
Policy, co-chairs the staff subcommit
tee. Davis is pleased with the response 
to a questionnaire the subcommittee sent 
out to all University staff members. 
About 21 percent of the 2082 question
naires have been returned so far, and 
people thought very carefully about 
what they were saying, said Davis.
Tademy and Trotter now expect the 
subcommittee reports to be finished by 
May, and hope to complete the final 
report over the summer.
Any member of the Carnegie Mellon 
community may comment about the sta
tus of minorities or offer testimony by 
sending email to Joe Trotter and Everett 
Tademy at minorities+@andrew or cam
pus mail c/o Tademy, WH 403.

New Development VP presents ideas at Faculty Senate meeting
By STEPH STINE
Tartan Staffwriter
Last Thursday afternoon at the Faculty Senate 
meeting, Eric Johnson presented his goals as 
Carnegie Mellons new Development Vice Presi
dent. After briefly introducing himself and his 
background in fundraising, Johnson spoke on his 
views on his role in the development of CMU.
Specifically, Johnson plans to work closely with 
the individual colleges on development issues. 
Development is not just a Warner Hall enter
prise, Johnson emphasized.
Johnson intends to increase his staff, particu
larly by establishing new director of development 
positions. These directors will work in conjunction 
with the deans and department heads in each 
college to coordinate fundraising projects.
Other organizational priorities disclosed by 
Johnson at Thursdays meeting include the in
crease of corporate financial support for CMU and 
the improvement of communications and general 
relations with CMU alumni. Johnson emphatij cally stated his desire for CMU to attain the best 
stewardship possible.
Elaborating on his plans to gain wider support of 
I CMU alumni, Johnson stated the necessity of build
ing class infrastructure. More frequent class re[ unions would be vital to this improvement. It was 
also pointed out that CMU alumni need to be made 
aware of changes made within the university.
Johnson plans to pursue a number of funding
priorities, especially the completion of the many 
building projects such as the new University Cen
ter. However, upon questioning, Johnson stated 
that the status of New Skibo still depends on 
that one major gift. He did not elaborate on what 
that gift was. The building project priority tops his 
list, followed by the analysis of the resources of 
CMUs undergraduate program. Ultimately, 
Johnson wishes to make it possible for the program 
to move into the top ten in the nation.
Johnson spent the past 20 years specializing in 
fundraising at MIT. As a result, he developed an 
expertise in acquiring corporate support. In addi
tion, Johnson spent seven years in industry.
Earlier in the Faculty Senate meeting, Jay 
Kadane announced the resolution of the faculty 
executive meeting with the executive committee of 
trustees on January 18. The ability of undergradu
ates to enroll in courses outside their majors was 
the main topic of discussion at the meeting. Al
though this university prioritizes the training of 
undergraduates for their careers, Kadane expressed 
a desire to give undergraduates every available 
opportunity to diversify their knowledge. As a 
result, the difficulties some students who wish to 
take courses outside their majors are currently 
facing should be countered.
At the next Faculty Senate meeting on February 
18, Charles Lowry, the new University librarian, 
will be the keynote speaker. Other topics of discus
sion will concern the alumni relations group and 
the undergraduate flow between colleges at CMU.
Senate seats emptied by 
resignations
RESIGNATIONS, from pogo 1
impact of Student Senate is barely felt.
Heinz Senator Jo Ann Holden also resigned 
because of time constraints. I didnt feel that I 
had the time to devote to Student Senate, said 
Holden. She said that she did not think nega
tively about Student Senate, though she also 
said that people should know that Student Sen
ate is involved with other student activities. She 
said that academically, she is overly committed, 
especially with internships.
SCS Senator Court Demas, who left CMU 
temporarily for the spring semester, was forced 
to resign. His only statement was that he did not 
have enough experience on Student Senate. 
CIT Senator David Byler also resigned, but he 
could not be reached for comment. Finally, CFA 
Senator Matt Morrow will officially resign this 
Tuesday due to an evening class conflict. Cur
rently, the number of definite vacancies are as 
follows: two CIT, one CFA, one Heinz, one IM, 
one Miscellaneous, and one SCS. According to 
Haverkamp, petitions are now being accepted to 
fill these vacancies. The petition must contain 
the name, college, address, and phone number of 
the candidate, along with 25 signatures from 
members of the candidates college.

FORUM
Resignations damage 
Senates credibility
At last Tuesdays Senate meet
ing, Senate Chair Gregory Haverkamp announced the resig
nation of fi ve Senators. These 
resignations bring the total 
number of vacancies in Senate 
to seven, and Haverkamp has 
hinted that more people may 
resign. ThelossofeffectiveSenators such as Moneet Singh, 
among others, is frustrating. 
Such sudden changes in Stu
dent Senate are unacceptable 
and, more importantly, avoid
able. They create a leadership 
vacuum that is difficult to fill.
Several Senators cited heavy 
course loads as a prime reason 
for resigning. This demonstrates 
no consideration for their con
stituents. When considering 
running for an elected position, 
a person must take into account 
the responsibilities of a Sena
tor. These duties include more 
than spending a few hours de
bating every Tuesday night. 
Senators must spend time work
ing on one of several commit
tees. Aspiring Senators must 
realize that their most impor
tant responsibility is represent
ing their constituents.
For these reasons, Senators 
cannot simply call it quits. They 
must plan ahead, to avoid con
flicts. Senators and Senatorselect must make sure the re
quired work will not be a bur
den beyond what they are will
ing to take on. If they decide 
that they will not be able to 
carry out their duties, they 
should resign. However, they
must inform Senate in advance, 
so as to give ample time to fill 
the vacancy.
Of course, students who feel 
they have time and dedication 
should consider running for Sen
ate. Student apathy is rampant 
on this campus, and an honest 
attempt by anyone to get in
volved and make a difference 
would be welcome. Before doing 
so, however, a person should 
know if he or she can afford the 
time and the commitment. Be
ing on Senate is more than an 
extra-curricular activity with 
which to pad ones resume. It is 
a major responsibility, and even 
the most motivated Senators 
contribute little to Student Gov
ernment if they suddenly resign 
at the beginning or in the middle 
of the semester.
Senate itself can help this situ
ation. With its creation last 
Tuesday of an independent Hu
man Resources committee to 
deed with internal problems and 
help Senators relate to one an
other, Senate has also created 
an organ that can aid new Sena
tors in determining exactly how 
much of a time commitment 
Senate will be.
Those Senators who resigned 
probably had good reasons for 
doing so. The shock of these sud
den resignations could have 
been minimized if the Senators 
had planned ahead. Leaving 
abruptly is more than just quit
ting Senate  its quitting on 
the constituents who elected 
them in the first place.Forum: an arena for

Letter to 
the Editor
OEditor:
I agree with David 
Hunt [America Sup
ports Human Rights 
Abuse, 1/18] that de
portations of people 
are terrible. Witness what is currently 
happening to the people of Yugoslavia, 
or what happened a year ago to the 
Gypsies who were living in Germany 
and were forced back to Rumania, or to 
the Palestinians who had lived in Ku
wait before the Iraq invasion.
However, from all that I have studied 
I conclude that while Hunts article is 
laden with emotion, it is absent fact. So 
let me cite a few facts:
1. The Palestinians who were deported 
were members of an organization called 
Hamas (which was mentioned once in 
passingin the article). Through its writ
ten material and through its spokespeople, Hamas has consistently called 
for the destruction of Israel and the 
killing of all Israelis.
2. Unlike even the P.L.O., Hamas has 
stated it will never seek to talk peace 
with Israel.
3. Hamas has murdered hundreds of 
fellow Palestinians because those Pales
tinians did not think correctly or act 
correctly" in accordance with Hamas 
fundamentalism. So, it doesnt matter 
whether members of Hamas are profes
sors, students, or laborers. What mat
ters is their goal of violence. I contend 
that should such a group exist in the 
United States we would be as worried as 
the Israelis are, and we would take ac
tion too.
I would also like to remind Hunt that 
Israel not only wants to conclude peace 
treaties with her neighbors but has pur
sued this goal for four decades. Need I 
remind him that only Egypt has a peace 
treaty with Israel. No one else has yet 
signed, but at least everyone is now 
talking with Israel.
Finally, because we so often neglect it 
and forget it, it is important to remem
ber that, yes, Israel is the only demo
cratic country in the Middle East. That 
is why Hunt and all of us have access to 
so much information. That is why the 
press and television crews are there while 
they cannot cover events in Syria or 
Saudi Arabia. That is why there are 
political parties and parliamentary de
bates and free expression in Israel. You 
cant find these in Kuwait, Iraq, or 
Yemen.
So I say stop beating up on Israel. 
Read and study a bit more and ask some 
hard questions. Maybe we dont agree 
with Israeli policies on some issues, but 
I believe that as responsible and learned 
adults we are obligated to support Israe
lis and their quest to live their lives in 
peace.

order to cope at CMU
Editor:
I would like to con
gratulate The Tartan 
on an excellent edito
rial last week about 
intervention
more than hint at the fact that he or she 
has a problem. As friends, we should 
always be looking out for these small 
hints because many times these small 
hints are actually cries for help.
Unfortunately, there are many people 
here that have no one to talk with. There 
are many people who get up in the morn
ing, go to class, come home, go to dinner, 
and go back home without ever having a 
person to say hi to. It is very surprising 
how much a simple Hello or a warm 
smile could mean to a person who is 
depressed and has nobody to turn to. 
There are just so many small things that 
one can do to brighten up somebody 
elses life.
It is very difficult to write about a 
subject as important as this while being 
so limited in space. So in just a sentence 
what I am trying to say is watch out for 
your friends, be there when they need 
you, and be friendly to as many people as 
you possibly can. Even though you may 
not realize it, you could be doing a world 
of good for somebody who desperately 
needs it.

Letter to the Editor
Letter to 
.. the Editorcrises intervention 
and the availability of counseling re
sources on campus. The editorial stressed 
a very important point in that students 
should always talk with someone when 
they have a problem.
As the editorial said, Human beings 
rely on one another for support and 
understanding and there is nothing 
wrong with asking someone to listen. 
This is absolutely the best advice that 
one could possibly give.
There is nothing wrong in going to 
others for help. The only problem is that 
in a place like CMU, the pressure to 
compete and be at the top is so great, 
that it is often difficult to go to friends 
and acquaintances for help.
As friends, we should always be look
ing out for one another. It is very easy for 
us not to notice that one of our good 
friends is having problems or that he or 
she is acting differently. It is even easier 
to ignore these changes in our friends. 
This, however, is something that we can 
never do. In a crisis situation, it is un
likely that a person will do anything

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  25 January 19937
Choosing the dreaded science elective
Abby Schiff
Something that everyone at Carnegie 
Mellon is justified in complaining about is 
the requirement that we take a certain 
number of courses outside our home col
lege. Nobody really knows how this got 
started. It certainly wasnt designed for 
the sole purpose of enrichment or well
roundedness, since these values are usu
ally frowned upon here.
I think it all began when someone sug
gested that everyone complete a writing 
requirement, for the purpose of employ
ment letters and corporate memos and the 
tiresome business of written communica
tion in general. At this point the engineers 
and scientists got mad and pointed out 
that if they had to suffer through writing, 
then by golly humanities students should 
have to take a class in Soil Mechanics. 
Finally, the two parties grudgingly reached 
a compromise consisting of a two-semes ter science requirementmainly because 
they both needed sleep and didnt want to 
sit around arguing for days on end.
So which science class should I take? a 
happy-go-lucky H&SS sophomore might 
inquire.. Well, the first thing I would sug
gest in this situation is to regard such a 
student with suspicion; there are no happygo-lucky CMU students left by the time 
sophomore year rolls around. Send this 
impostor over to Financial Aid until he 
shapes up and lets get on with the impor
tant business of choosing a science elec
tive.
Perhaps past experience will provide us
with a clue. I took loads of science classes 
in high school, which may explain the 
nightmares Ive been having ever since. 
The administrators at the school thought 
that forcing hapless teenagers to learn 
about science would help us to expand our 
minds. Either that or they actually thought 
a great majority of us would need to know 
exactly how mitosis works in order to lead 
fulfilling lives or at least become respect
able taxpaying citizens. Terrifying weekly 
laboratory exercises, designed to improve 
our scientific aptitude even further, only 
worsened the situation. They made gym 
class seem fun by comparison, which was
tion by conducting experiments as though 
we were toddlers and the Bunsen burners 
and volatile chemicals were nothing more 
than a glorified Play-Doh Fun Factory. 
The only people who actually paid any 
attention in chemistry were those stu
dents who saw the potential for a reward
ing and high-paying career in the field. 
Unfortunately for them, our teacher never 
did teach us how to make LSD or plastic 
explosives. I emerged from the experience 
secure in the knowledge that if you con
nect enough Cs, H's, and Os together in 
the shape of a tomato, you get something 
really important. Really.
Newton's hypothesis that an object in motion 
tends to stay in motion helps us explain some 
of the universes more mysterious phenomena, 
such as Macaulay Culkin's career.
probably no accident.
Biology was definitely the scariest. We 
had to find out our blood types through the 
complex scientific method of pricking our 
index fingers with a barbed pin, letting the 
blood dribble out onto specially treated 
glass slides, and passing out. This doesnt 
necessarily mean that the exercise failed 
to enrich our scientific aptitude. I, for one, 
wont soon forget my first glimpse of a 
panicked Assistantus Principalius speci
men asking us kids lying sprawled on the 
floor of the classroom if any of our parents 
were lawyers.
Chemistry wasnt much fun either, but 
at least the labs didnt involve in-depth 
examination of bodily fluids that most 
people, or at least those of us with weak 
stomachs, would just as soon not know 
about. Instead, we risked severe mutilaPhysics was my favorite science, mainly 
because the labs did not involve fetal pigs, 
formaldehyde, or noxious gases (so long as 
the crusty old substitute gym teacher 
stayed a good distance away from the 
room.) Physics tells us that if you let go of 
an object in mid-air  say, a valuable 
antique vaseit will fall to the earth with 
a thundering crash. Physics doesnt go 
into how you explain to the insurance 
adjuster that you used a Ming vase to 
prove something that any moron on the 
street already knows. Yet many of the 
fundamental rules of science are known to 
us today because physicists were persis
tent in their search for knowledge even 
when they couldnt afford insurance poli
cies. Boyles Law, for instance, tells us 
that a watched pot never boyles. And 
Newtons hypothesis that an object in
motion tends to stay in motion helps us 
explain some of the universes more mys
terious phenomena, such as Macaulay 
Culkins career.
The only other science classes I dared 
tako after surviving the previous throe 
were geology and nutritional chomistry. 
In geology, we learned that if you sit 
around listening to someono discussing 
rocks for more than 10 minutes, you will 
probably fall asleep. Nutritional chemis
try was much more interesting, mainly 
because the teacher was a health food 
enthusiast whose plan for healthy living 
involved choking down vitamin pills the 
size of horse tranquilizers several times a 
day. He told us that large doses of vita
mins would slow aging, prevent cancer, 
and improve our sex lives measurably. He 
also insisted that there was a conspiracy 
to keep this information from the general 
public, one involving the American Medi
cal Association, the CIA, and possibly 
Florence Henderson. Nutritional chemis
try didnt make much sense, but it sure 
was entertaining.
All this brings us no closer to the funda
mental question at hand, which is how to 
fulfill the H&SS science requirement with
out years of remedial tutoring. Theres no 
way around it, and I suppose the technical 
majors met their side of the bargain fresh
man year when they suffered through 
thousands of pages on the subject of lit
eracy, or alternately, bulimia. Come to 
think of it, maybe science courses arent 
all that bad. If I could only remomber 
which vitamins Im supposed to tako for... 
er, extending my life span, this scientific 
stuff just might prove worthwhile.

who never won a prize in the science fairs 
of her youth.Role of First Lady evolving dramatically
Continued from ROLE, page 6
Personally, I dont see what the 
big hoopla is. During the cam
paign, Clintons team jokingly 
adopted a vote for one, get one 
free attitude. That is, until people 
got a little uncomfortable with 
the idea of, God forbid, the 
Presidents wife advising him. 
With the campaign over, how
ever, and the need to tone down 
her image gone, Im glad Hillarys 
going to get involved in the gov
ernment.
A few conservatives, though, 
are afraid. Whos going to wield 
the power of the Presidency, Bill 
Clinton or her? Who will really 
decide policy? Just how much in
fluence will the Presidents wife 
have? The answer is, who cares? 
Clinton is the President, and all 
authority for executive decisions 
rest with him. Likewise, so does 
the responsibility.
All these unfounded worries 
arise from the fact that Hillary 
Clinton doesnt fit the mold that 
people demand of the Presidents
wife. She isnt the homemaker 
who takes on her own special 
social cause. She doesnt appear 
to be the person who doesnt 
really get involved in politics.
Face it, Hillary Clinton is scar
ing people. Shes taking on 
health care, an area she dealt 
with when she worked with 
the Childrens Defense Fund. 
Wow, something Clinton pushed 
during his campaign. Imagine 
that!
At this point, a certain num
ber of people are going to start 
accusing me of several things. 
Theyre going to call me and all 
those who support Hillary 
Clinton a bunch of feminists. 
Well, Im not one  not by a 
longshot.
Theyre also going to accuse 
me of sayingthatthe job of home
maker is not a noble one and 
that Im arguing against 
womens nature. Nothing could 
be further from the truth. I think 
Barbara Bush was a great First 
Lady. She did what she wanted.
Hillary Clinton should be given 
the same opportunity.
No doubt, there are those who 
believe she should have nothing 
to do with national policy, foreign 
affairs, etc. The fact of the mat
ter, however, remains that 
Clinton can consult with whom
ever he chooses. If he wishes to 
obtain his wifes opinion on the
that one, Bill. I have to check the 
alignment of the stars for an an
swer.
One good thing that has come 
of this debate is the revival of 
interest in the role of First Lady. 
In just about every story covering 
this issue, you read something 
about Woodrow Wilsons wife, 
who handled a great amount of
At least Hillary, a lawyer with a good 
amount of experience, isn't saying, 
Let me get back to you on that one, 
Bill. I have to check the alignment of 
the stars for an answer. 
Israeli deportation, so be it. As 
long as he gives it as much cre
dence as advice from other advi
sors and experts, he is merely 
examining different viewpoints. 
At least Hillary, a lawyer with a 
good amount of experience, isnt 
saying, Let me get back to you on
work after his stroke. You also 
learn about other famous First 
Ladies. In short, it becomes very 
evident that they have always 
had influence on their husbands.
By looking at the structure of 
their relationship, one may dis
cover that Clinton will still be the

one calling the shots and signing 
the bills. When asked by a re
porter about arguments between 
the two, Clinton once said that he 
would say, Youre wrong, and 
Hillary would later say, I told 
you so. They have a respect for 
each other, and that respect 
shows that they can disagree and 
still do their jobs. I doubt Clinton 
will back off on a position he holds 
just to avoid a spat with his wife.
Hillary Rodham Clinton has 
received more bad press than she 
deserves. Shes been labeled as a 
radical feminist who will hold 
absolute control as the real 
President. As to the first accusa

held by insecure people. And as 
for the second, lets wait until 
shes elected to start calling her 
Ms. President.

Record-breaker wins UAA award while teammate leads rout of Bethany
Lemieux, 
Penguins face 
adversity 
again
It was quiet this weekend, like 
the calm before the storm. It 
seems like nothing of note really 
happened, except for an eerie 
hush, that spread slowly across 
the country, a reverent silence 
that I recognized was the same 
silence that people exhibit when 
theyre in a church, when words 
somehow seem irreverent and 
impotent. Some may have felt 
less of it, others more, but it was 
there. All eyes uneasily searched 
the horizon, in anticipation of the 
BIG day. January 31st. Super 
Bowl Sunday.
But in Pittsburgh, things were 
different. The Steelers have been 
eliminated, and I guess that loss 
has been stored on the shelf right 
beside the Pirates miserable 
1992 playoff defeat. However, a 
different kind of silent pall has 
settled over the Steel City. The 
city mourns because its number 
one son, Mario Lemieux, has 
cancer.
Yes, folks, dont kid yourselves. 
Hodgkins Disease is cancer of 
the lymph system. Mario is going 
to get radiation treatment, and 
let me tell you that any time free 
electrons with more energy than 
you could shake a stick at are set 
loose to party down into your 
body, its bad news. Sure, you 
might get the cancer to go into 
remission, but side effects are 
always lurking around the 
comer, kind of like a hangover.
Even if all of General Manager 
Craig Patricks horses and all of 
his men manage to put Mario 
back together again, it doesnt 
mean that he will be cured of the 
disease. It means that the cancer 
will go into remission, a kind of 
dormancy, but it could recur at 
any time.
Its time to look at the situa
tion realistically. They say Mario 
will recover, that his athletic 
sportsmanship will pull him 
through. I say Bull-ony. Pipe 
dream. What will pull him 
through is treatment and luck. 
The Penguins need to stop 
putting all their eggs in 
Lemieuxs overstuffed basket.
The team needs to play with the 
attitude that Mario may not 
return, that this situation is not 
simply a case of holding the 
fort until the cavalry arrives.
Mario is a key to the Penguins 
success. Deny that, and you live 
in Candyland. Sure, center Ron 
Francis can, and has, stepped up 
! to be counted on more offen
sively. His trademark two-way 
game becomes increasingly one
way. But Ron does not have 
Marios hands. Jaromir Jagr 
i does; too bad hes a snot-nosed 
punk who has little or no concept 
f what team leadership means. 
Hes quick, hes good, hes 
spoiled.
This Penguins team needs to 
have Francis and Jagr work 
Oore efficiently together. Francis 
Deeds to set up the plays while 
Jagr puts the puck in the net.
Ron has the ability to do that, 
but hell have to work harder 
than he ever did before. As for 
^agr, I think Rick Tocchet had 
the right solution: beat the kid 
wto the fetal position at least 
twice a day, and soon, youll have 
him eating right out of the palm 
fyour hand.

The Carnegie Mellon swim 
team capped a week which saw 
one of its members named UAA 
Athlete of the Week by sweeping 
a decisive victory over Bethany 
College on Saturday.
The mens team ran its record 
to 5-1 overall with a 79-54 win, 
while the womens team won its 
second dual meet in a row, 8479, 
to pull its record to 2-4 on the 
season.
Meanwhile, the UAA an
nounced that freshman Rebecca 
Fruehan was the winner of the 
Athlete of the Week award in the 
Swimming and Diving  Women 
category for the week of January 
11.
During that week, Fruehan set 
a CMU school record in the 200-
yard freestyle event with a time 
of 1:59.01, breaking the mark 
set by CMU alum Francesca 
Crannell in 1990. The time also 
set a Washington & Jefferson 
pool record. She was also a three
time winner against Hiram Col
lege, winning the 50-yard 
freestyle, the 100- yard butter
fly and swimming as part of the 
victorious 400- yard medley re
lay team.
[Being named Athlete of the 
Week] shows Ive accomplished 
something, Fruehan said. It 
shows all the pain and effort 
was worth it. All the hard work 
weve done [as a team] has paid 
off.
Shes been doing great, coach 
Jim Cutrone said. She came in 
oneofthetop swimmers in Penn
sylvania, but while she was a 
very strong swimmer, she was
technically weak. Shes worked 
real hard all season, and shes 
just been doing great.
Against Bethany, Fruehan 
broke another school record, in 
the 100 yard backstroke, finish
ing with a time ofl:03.65.Theold 
record of1:06.20 was set by CMU 
alum Leslie McGill in 1990. 
Fruehan also won the 200 yard 
individual medley in 2:23.40 and 
was part of the winning 200 yard 
medley relay team along with 
sophomores Caroline Kanet and 
Sarah Broadley and freshman 
Lynn Babyak.
The wins continued showing 
that the transition for Fruehan is 
not that difficult. As a freshman, 
the change was not too bad, she 
said. The program is very simi
lar to my high school, and I really 
like the team and the coach.
I actually started doing well
after our trip to Florida [a trainingsession over winter vacation]. 
That definitely put things in per
spective for me  that really 
helped. Im excited to see how I do 
at the UAA meet (February 11- 
13).
As for the meet with Bethany, 
Cutrone said the meet was not as 
close as the score seemed.
We totally dominated, he 
said. Bethany is a small school, 
but they like swimming us. We 
swam a lot of exhibition events, 
where we scored no points. It 
looks better, and its a courtesy to 
them. In a meet like this, you 
want to avoid running up the 
score.
Freshman mainstay Geoff 
Waller was the big winner for the 
men on the day, picking up three 
victories: the 200- yard (1:50.20) 
and 100 -yard freestyle (1:05.00)
events and the 100- yard back
stroke (0:59.80). Meanwhile, 
freshman Anuj Gupta set a per
sonal best time in the 100- yard 
backstroke, finishing third in 
1:05.70.
The other womens highlight, 
outside of Fruehans record, was 
freshman Holley Anstats first col
legiate win, a 2:21.03 perfor
mance in the 200- yard freestyle.
The team has one dual meet 
left, on Saturday, when the Tar
tans host the Slippery Rock Rock
ets at 1:00 p.m. Cutrone is satis
fied with the teams performance 
as the UAA meet approaches.
Were basically right where we 
should be, he said. Im pleased 
with the results.
After the Slippery Rock meet, 
the team will be off for two weeks 
before the UAA championshipsat 
Washington University.
Womens basketball team loses in overtime
Team drops heartbreaking contest
By GARY WILSON
Tartan Staffwriter
In what was probably the most exciting 
game of the season thus far, the womens 
basketball team fell in overtime to Wash
ington University 81-75. The loss was their 
third straight, after a five game winning 
streak. Head coach Gerri Seidl was im
pressed with the teams effort. I thought 
our kids played a really tough, hard-nosed 
game.
The contest opened with Tartans leading 
scorer junior Jeanine Megahan and sopho
more Meredith McKnight taking turns at 
scoring. Within the first five minutes of the 
game, CMU had built up a 12-4 lead. De
spite missing a number of shots, the team 
seemed to be in total control.
Halfway through the first half, Megahan 
appeared to be trying out for the Harlem 
Globetrotters as she pulled off an incred
ible play. There was a scramble on the floor 
before Megahan grabbed the ball while 
lying on her back. She then sat up and 
tossed the ball high over two defenders to a 
waiting McKnight who set up sophomore 
Jenny Gretz for the hoop.
Slowly, the Bears battled back and built 
up a 22-18 lead with nine minutes left in 
the half. Junior Chandra Buist took control 
of the game, scoring eight points in three 
minutes to give the lead back to CMU 28- 
22. Coming into the game, Buists season 
high for a game was six points.
We knew what she was capable of all 
along, said Seidl, Shes starting to come
around again. The Tartans finished the 
first half leading 37-31, thanks in part to 
shooting 52 percent from the field.
The second half remained close with 
Megahan and McKnight staying hot from 
the field. They scored seven of the first eight 
baskets for the Tartans. Senior team cap
tain Kelly Sterling picked off a stray pass 
and walked in alone to give CMU their 
largest lead of the game at nine.
The Bears then went on a 13-1 tear to 
take a 60-57 lead, thanks in part to a num
ber of Tartans turnovers and lack of re
bounding. This set up the last five minutes 
of play, an exciting see-saw battle.
The teams exchanged baskets four times 
before Gretz drove the ball upcourt and 
passed off to Megahan who was fouled on a 
shot attempt. Megahan knocked down both 
foul shot attempts to tie the score at 67.
With under one minute to play, Megahan 
stole the ball but missed a layup. Washing
ton missed a foul shot attempt, and Gretz 
was fouled grabbing the rebound. She con
verted two foul shots and CMU led 71-68 
with 26 seconds remaining.
Washingtons Stacy Leeds hit a three 
pointer with seven seconds left to tie the 
game. She was also fouled on the play but 
was unable to hit the game winning foul 
shot. The game went into overtime where 
the Bears pulled away with the victory 81 
75.
Seidl assessed the Tartans effort. At first, 
we were concentrating on their guards and 
the girls were executingreal well. They kept

Tartans clawed by Washington University Bears 76-62 for third straight league defeat
By GARY WILSON
Tartan Staffwriter
After getting off to their best start ever, 
the Carnegie Mellon mens basketball 
team has fallen on hard times. The team 
opened the season with a 9-1 record, but 
following the teams lost to Washington 
University on Friday night, they have 
lossed three straight. Washington de
feated the Tartans 76-62 in a game that 
was far closer than the score showed. 
According to coach Tony Wingen, Were 
not pushing any panic buttons. Were 
going to come back and were going to win 
some games.
Junior forward Derek Dragisich opened 
the scoring with a fifteen-footer. Shortly 
after that, Dragisich and Washingtons 
Brent Dalrymple were up for a rebound 
when Dalrymple hauled him down, slam
ming him to the floor. Tempers began to 
rise, setting the tempo for the rest of the 
game.
The Tartans seemed to gain control 
early as they slowly built up a nine- point 
lead. Washington had a short rally, scor
ing seven straight points. At 10:15, CMU 
once again took control with four differ
ent players scoring to increase the lead 
to 23-13.
Between the six and the two minute 
mark, CMU was held without a point, 
allowing the Bears to battle back and tie
the score by halftime.
We cant have those kinds of lapses, 
said Wingen, Thats something to im
prove on. We were the better team for 
thirty minutes. That was the difference 
in the game
Dragisich ended the first half with 12 
points and junior center Charlie 
Connors was a perfect three for three 
from the field for 6 points.
The CMU defense did their job by 
limiting Washingtons big gun, Charlie 
Borsheim, to two hoops on six attempts. 
The Tartans only committed three turn
overs in comparison to eleven by the 
Bears.
The second half proved to be less 
promising. Washington opened the scor
ing 19:07 in, and both teams exchanged 
five baskets. At 14:43, senior guard 
Todd Jenkins and junior forward Mike 
Hosni came down on a two-on-one. 
Jenkins made the perfect pass and 
Hosni finished to bring the Tartans 
within one at 39-38. However, this 
would be the closest CMU would get.
Coach Wingen commented on the play 
of Jenkins, one of the teams captains. 
The guy that has really given us everythingis Todd Jenkins. Hes been a leader 
on and off the court. He has done every
thing that we would hope he would do.
Missed opportunities soon began to 
haunt the CMU offense, and bit by bit,
the Bears began to pull away. It was 
ours for the takingwe just didnt take 
it, said Jenkins. We missed shots that 
we normally make. It really deflated us. 
At 12:03, Washingtons Gene Nolan 
personally took control and started sink
ing every shot he took. With five and one 
half minutes in the game, Nolan had 
helped the Bears take a commanding 18 
point lead. The Tartans kept up with 
Washington, slowly chipping away at 
the lead, but were unable to close the
gap.
Junior guard Rony Johns led the Tar
tans with 13 points on the night. Hosni 
pulled down five rebounds to lead the 
team. Connors summed up the teams 
effort. I dont think we were playing 
aggressive on defense. We didnt attack 
them enough.
The loss was the fourth for the Tar
tans, and they have all come in league 
play. While posting a 7-0 record outside 
the University Athletic Association, the 
team needs to win more when it counts.
It is not going to be easy in the UAA. 
According to Wingen, The UAA is a very 
balanced conference this year. Every 
game is a big game.
With the outstanding start, and now 
the recent setback, opinions on the play 
of this team are varied.
Senior co-captain Chris Benec gave 
his impressions. People think that were
playing better than expected, but we are not 
playing as well as we expected. We havent 
reached our potential. I believe all the guys 
believe that.
With the importance of winning every game, 
every advantage that the guys can get will 
help greatly. This is where crowd support at 
home games could come into play. Although 
fan support is increasing, the players would 
appreciate seeing more people come out for 
their games.
Co-captain Todd Jenkins appreciates a lot 
of fans in Skibo gym. I like playing in front of 
a crowd. I understand that everyone has work 
to do, but its only two hours, and were fun to 
watch play.
Wingen said that at the last two home 
games we have had good crowds. They were 
real vocal and rowdy. That helps you as a 
player, as an athlete, as a coach. The more 
motivated we are, the better we play. 
Increased fan support could possibly be the 
one element needed to assure the success of 
the team.
Come out to the mens next game this 
Wednesday at 7:30 pm when the Tartans take 
on the Presidents of Washington and Jefferson 
College.
When these two teams met earlier in No
vember the Tartans pulled out a last second 
66-64 victory.
Both mens and womens games against the 
University of Chicago yesterday took place 
too late to appear in this issue.

Indoor track breaks ice at 
Robert Morris invitational
: By ERIC STRAUSS
| Tartan Assistant Sports Editor
The Carnegie Mellon indoor 
track team warmed up the Ice! breaker Invitational at Robert 
Morris College, their first meet of 
the season. Because early invita
tional meets stress individual 
| competition, no team scores were 
kept, but mens coach Gary 
iMeckley said the mens team 
I probably would have come in sec! ond to Ohios Youngstown State.
Weve basically only practiced 
for a week or so, Meckley said. 
Against mostly Division I 
I schools, I thought we did well. 
We made some mistakes which 
I cost us, but overall, our perfor
mance was very good. Of all the 
teams there, Youngstown State
was the only team that probably 
would have beaten us.
No men picked up individual 
wins, but six members of the team 
posted top three finishes.
A pair of sophomores, Kevin 
Keir and Phil Joyce, finished sec
ond and third respectively in the 
35-pound weight throw, while 
four track runners took second 
place finishes: junior Derron 
Haley (55-meter hurdles); junior 
Jarrod Siket (400-meter run); 
senior Sean McDowell (800- 
meter run); and freshman Mike 
Ray (1,500-meter run).
Meanwhile, the womens per
formance was headlined by fresh
man Missy Baustert, who set a 
school record of 2:25.6 with her 
third place finish in the 800 meter 
run. The other top three finishers

changing things up and we had 
to change to adjust. A lot of the 
problem is inexperience. They 
did adjust, which is good. We 
are seeing growth in our team. 
Were are definitely growing.
The Tartans dominated the 
majority of the game, but 
couldnt pull out a victory in the 
end.
They were better in rebound
ing (50-40), field goal shooting 
(43% -42%), and free throw 
shooting (83%47%).
McKnight led the team with 
23 points. She has been the 
player to watch recently, scor
ing 118 points (19.7 points per 
game) in the last six games. 
McKnight also leads the team 
in rebounds, averaging 11 a 
game.
Earlier in the week, the Tar
tans dropped a 56-44 decision 
at Grove City in a non-league 
match. Gretz and McKnight led 
the Tartans with 15 and 14 
points, respectively.
The Tartans looked to reverse 
ttheir fortunes on Sunday at 
the University of Chicago, but 
the game was too late for re
sults to appear in this issue.
Look for all the late results in 
next weeks issue of The Tar
tan, which is coming out Febru
ary 1.
The women will next travel to 
upstate New York to take on 
the University of Rochester 
Yellowjackets on Friday, before 
headingnortheast to Massachu
setts to tangle with the Judges 
of Brandeis University on Sun
day.

Hockey club splits two games
By ERIC STRAUSS
Tartan Assistant Sports Editor
The Carnegie Mellon Ice 
Hockey Club split a pair of exhi
bition games to open the second 
half of their season, falling to 
Duquesne University, 4-3, in 
overtime and then coming back 
cruise past Community Col*ege of Allegheny County 
(CCAC), 12-4.
The Duquesne contest showed 
a little rust on the Tartans 
states, as they held a one-goal 
kad three times, eventually lostog each one.
We were a little rusty, coach 
ave Collins said. We played a 
good game but got tired and out
of playing shape late in the game. 
That took a big toll.
Sophomore defenseman Greg 
Jessop, in his first game back 
after breaking his thumb in the 
teams opening game, scored one 
goal, while graduate student 
Dave Umland and freshman 
Roger Maddalena had the other 
two goals. Scott Berry minded 
the net and took the loss.
In the CCAC game, the team 
turned everything around. 
Umland scored an incredible 
seven goals as the squads first 
line tallied all 12 goals.
Berry, playing on left wing, 
racked up a hat trick of his own 
with four goals, and graduate stu
dent Scott Sarbacker had the
other tally.
The club is now 2-2 in exhibi
tion games, and opens the sec
ond half ofits West Penn College 
Hockey Association season on 
Saturday against the Allegheny 
College team at the Meadville 
Ice Arena.
The team follows that with a 
game at Kirk Nevin Arena in 
Greensburg against Indiana 
University ofPennsylvania, then 
hosts the University of Pitts
burgh, Allegheny College, and 
Penn State West.
The team then returns to the 
road, taking on West Virginia 
University in Morgantown be
fore finishing the regular season 
hosting Slippery Rock.

Pitt Bulls begin fourth indoor lacrosse season
ByLUBOMIRKOCHANSKYJ
Tartan Sports Editor
Looking for something differ
ent to do on a Saturday night? 
How about an indoor lacrosse 
game at the Civic Arena.
ThePittsburgh Bulls have just 
begun their fourth season in the 
Major Indoor Lacrosse League 
(MILL).
There are three more home 
games scheduled for the season: 
against the Detroit Turbos on 
January 30; against the New 
York Saints on February 13; and 
against the Baltimore Thunder 
on February 27.
The Bulls have gotten off to an 
0-2 start with losses to the Buf
falo Bandits 17-10 and the New 
York Saints 11-10 in overtime.
The Detroit Turbos, reigning 
National Division champs, are 
in town this Saturday.
The Bulls are looking to avenge 
two losses sufferedlast season at 
the hands of the Turbos.
Both forwards Mark Gold and
Jeff Wills lead the team with 
three goals and throe assists for 
six points.
Gold was asked about the im
portance of the upcoming game 
against Detroit.
This may be our biggest game 
of the year. We need to dictate 
the nature of the game."
The Turbos will be lead by the 
Gait brothers, Paul and Gary , 
who have lead the MILL in goals, 
assists, and points for the past 
two seasons.
Since lacrosse is not as widely 
known as some other sports, a 
recent MILL press release listed 
some interesting facts:
Lacrosse is North Americas 
oldest sport, with origins dating 
before the 1400s.
Indoor lacrosse began in 
Canada, played on iceless ice 
rinks in the summer.
Lacrosse is currently enjoyed 
by over 750,000 people across 
the United States.
The average salary of players 
in the MILL is $250 a game.
Most players como from the rich 
collogo lacrosse programs in 
Maryland.
Carnegie Mellon has both 
mens and women's lacrosse club 
teams.
For moro information on join
ing please call Bayard Johnson 
at 421-8629 and x3771.
Danielle Proctoris manager of 
both the mens and womens 
teams. She can be reached at 
x4890.

Alpha Phi Omega pledges leadership, friendship, serviceSmart seniors find time 
to help out community
By BOB DIXON
Tartan Senior Staffwriter
Sophomore chemical engineer Karen Yun found out about Alpha Phi Omega through a 
friend, and began meeting brothers of the national co-educational service fraternity in social 
situations. In the fall of1992 Yun pledged A Phi 0 because she wanted to help people both on 
and off campus. I joined A Phi 0 because it is a service fraternity, Yun said, I wanted to help 
other people than on campus  I wanted to help the community.
The fraternity Yun pledged is a national organization with three cardinal principles: 
leadership, friendship, and service. For brothers of A Phi 0, these principles are enacted 
specifically in four places, the four Cs: campus, community, country, and 
chapter. On campus, service projects include producing the CBook, operating the Book Exchange at the beginning of each 
semester, running the Airport Shuttle and Magic Bus at 
Thanksgiving and Spring Break, and manning conces
sion stands at football games and during Spring Carni
val. Community projects include activities with the Bra
dley Centera center for disadvantaged childrenthe 
Boy Scouts of America, and the United Way, and fund
raisers including the Ugliest Mug on Campus Contest.
Alpha Phi Omega services the campus and community in 
ways that go beyond weekly and seasonal activities. A 
bulletin board-sized calendar in the A Phi 0 office is covered 
with phrases like Service hours ... Donate prizes  VOL
UNTEER! ... Scout First Aid Meet ... WQEX [Alpha Phi 
Omega answers telephones for WQEX during fundraising 
drives].... KDS [A Phi O annually gives a scholarship in 
memory of Kent D. Shaffer, former group advisor noted 
for his extensive community service, to a CMU stu
dent not affiliated with A Phi 0 who exemplifies 
fraternity values].
Mixed in with community service reminders 
are notices demonstrating the friendship as
pect of the fraternity  birthday notices 
and social announcements. A lot of close 
friendships have come out of A Phi 0, 
said Connie Wai, senior industrial 
managementmajor. There are lots 
of fun people to do things with, 
said Jeff Brown (senior, SDS). I 
like to have an immediate effect on the 
community.
For computer science major Dale 
Newfield, who pledged the fraternity in 
the fall of1990, What A Phi 0 embodies 
and my ideas, ideals, and values are 
very identical.  These ideals began with 
Carnegie Mellons Kappa Chapter on 
April 29, 1929, four years after the 
first chapter (December 16, 1925) was founded at
Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania. The fraternity was begun at Lafayette 
by Frank Reed Horton, a navy ensign looking for a way to maintain high standards

Many people naturally want to help those in need, but most of us feel like we 
cant make a difference by ourselves. Mortar Board Honor Society recently 
gave members of the campus community an excellent opportunity to band 
together for a good cause, and it will soon give us another chance to be 
of service.
In November, the members of Mortar Board put boxes 
in all the dorms and academic buildings and some 
administrative buildings for folks to fill with un
wanted clothing. The call for aid did not go unan
swered. The campus community collectively do
nated around 14 boxes of clothing. The turnout 
surprised us, said senior industrial manage
ment major and co-president of Mortar Board 
Matt Gile. We didnt expect so much." Thats 
enough clothes to fill about the same number of 
large recycling bins, and in a way these clothes 
will be recycled. Mortar Board is donating them to 
the Light of Life Rescue Mission, a homeless shel
ter in the North Side. Wo choso Light of Life 
because its nearby, and evoryone whos seen tl)e 
beggars in Oakland can rolute to homclessnoss, said 
president Meryom Tangoron, a sonior in industrial 
design. Mortar Board is pleased with the results. The 
people on campus are roally very genorous, said Mortar 
Board advisor Katie Stannard, assistant to tho Doan bf 
Student Affairs. It was a nice way to clean out your closet 
and donate to a good cause at the same time.
Mortar Board is an honor society for fourth year stu
dents, with tho first requirement for membership u QPA

get funding from Student Senate or National Mortar 
Board. Unfortunately, with an honor society liko this, 
people think, I worked hard to get in. I dont have to do 
anything. Its an easy thing to put on a rtSsumfi, said 
Tangoren. We want to make it so that people will look forward 
to becoming a member, feel pride in being a member. People 
who maintain their grades should be recognized, and people 
willing to donate time to service should be further recognize^, 
said Soma Agarwal, vice president and a senior in computer 
science. Agarwal said, We would like to become a more social 
service organization. She and Gile agree that Mortar Board pro
vides its members a way to mingle with people in other colleges arjd 
disciplines. Mortar Board can make doing community service easier 
for the campus, said Agarwal.
Tangoren says that its Mortar Boards purpose to make community 
service easier for the campus to participate in, but its hard to get people 
involved when they dont know about the organization. A Phi 0 gets 
recognized for things it always does, such as the C-Book. Thats the koy 
to becoming well-known on campus, according to Tangoren. An organizaPleaso see MORTAR BOARD, page L3

the training for tutors is extensive. 
Therefore, no tutors are thrown into a 
situation that they cant handle and the

:----------tig Brothers/Big Sisters 
interest, not enthusiasm
By JESSICA FANG
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
CMU is phasing out its current Big 
Brothers/Big Sisters program due to 
lack of funds from Student Senate. 
Senate isnt being unnecessarily per
nicious. However, membership has 
shrunk and it is difficult to justify 
funding when there is little student 
involvement. The membership of fif
teen dropped to ten, said Big Broth
ers/Big Sisters president Suzanne 
Bartlett, and most of those are gradu
ating.
As a result, the organization is now 
in the process of organizing a new 
program with Reizenstein Middle 
School. Students at Reizenstein will 
be able to come to CMU to spend about 
four hours a week with their Big (the 
programs lingo for a Big Brother or 
Sister) to get a feel for the college 
campus and to get a taste of what 
college life is really like. The applica
tion process is lengthy, and with good 
reason. Its important that the Bigs 
are screened carefully, consideringthe 
influence they can have on an impres
sionable adolescent. The basic require
ments for being a Big are that you be 
a college student, that you like chil
dren and that you have access to a car. 
(This, again, is as a result of a lack bf 
funds for transportation.)
Getting involved requires filling out 
an inquiry form with name, address, 
and other information. Additional 
papers are sent to the headquarters of 
the applicants state to check for a 
criminal record. The case worker as
signed will then take a look at where 
the potential Big lives and the types of 
people he or she lives with. Next comes
the interview, where the applicant is 
asked about his or her interests, so 
that the case worker can get a feel for 
compatibility with a little brother or 
sister.
All this takes time, since the case 
workers want to make sure they find 
a perfect match between a Big and 
aLittle. Bartlett said, Although the 
entire process can take close to a year 
to finalize, the end result is worth it. 
The process takes so long because the 
social workers need to make sure that 
the people volunteering are going to 
be right for the program. It might take 
a while to get approved; however, it is 
worth the wait.
When one first begins the program, 
the case worker in tho area willkeep 
tabs on the Big, calling once a week to 
see how well the two are getting along, 
and to talk about any other problems 
which might have been encountered. 
Annual meetings are held so that ev
ery pair of siblings can voice their 
opinion on the program and suggest 
possible improvements and changes. 
There are also holiday parties held, 
such as Halloween and Christmas, 
where athletes from tho Pittsburgh 
area somotimes make guest appear
ances and the children can get auto
graphs and have pictures taken.! 
People who have knowledge of the 
program generally do what they can ! 
to help," says Bartlett.
If you think this program sounds 
worthwhile, and you would like to 
participate, or if you would like more 
information, contact Suzanne Bartlett 
at x3969 or call the Big Brothers and 
Big Sisters organization for the 
Shadyside/Oakland/Squirrel Hill area 
at 621-6100.

Schlag's Nose
by Graham Gibby
Whats the deal with the plaque 
of Arthur Hammerschlag in the 
front of Baker Hall? Do people 
really rub his nose for good luck? 
This and other questions like it 
are the purpose of this column. 
To wit, the Questions You Al
ways Had, but Didnt Know Who 
To Ask.
On Schlags noseno one has 
ever seen gnomes or the like pol
ishing the thing. There is photo
graphic evidence of Rubbing for 
Luck, however, though the sub
ject of the shot wishes not to be 
revealed. What? Id look like a 
geek! Besides, its a bad picture.
As you walk about campus, do 
questions come up, things that 
make you scratch your head, won
der aloud to the person next to 
you? Well, hero is your chance to 
get the answer  ask me. Some
times Ill know the answer from 
my Great Bag of Wisdom (GBW), 
fallible as it may be, which allows 
me to report without attributing 
my sources. The GBW is really 
just my almost-three-years of ex
perience and exploring on cam
pus. Im not sure why I spent 
those late hours walking through 
buildings, but I did. Various class 
projects have put me in contact 
with other aspects of the Univer
sity, and Ive picked up some 
things along the way.
A good bit of the column will be 
stories, like the time Jennifer 
Sorenson and some friends were 
riding Kiltie trays down the side
walk where the GSIA addition is 
now. She was the first one down 
the icy sidewalk and managed to 
smack the back of her head into 
the fire hydrant at the bottom. 
There was talk of brain damage 
and concern over the fact that 
she was unconscious. She revived, 
however, and a lesson was
when the space now holding the 
Tartan Grill and Salads Plus was 
the Kiltie Cafe. Im not going to 
try to talk about Buggy or Carni
val as Unknowns, but hopefully, 
Ill get some good stories. Thats 
where the readers come in. If you 
want to be remembered in these 
pages, or at least be able to say 
Hey! Thats me! give me a call 
at x5460, or email to gglb. We'll 
talk, Ill take some notes, more 
people will read because you told 
them to. Everybody wins. But, to 
get to the fun part of the column:

learned. For the rest of the after
noon, someone had to be hydrant 
guard and look out for people.
But how is that story perti
nent to 'Schlags Nose? the engi
neer in the back asks. Well, 
traying (always an awkward 
term) is one of those CMU 
Things that we tell our relatives 
and friends about when they come 
to visit, along with the Gravity 
Feed Assembly Line explanation 
for the Baker/Porter hallway 
downgrade. Tour guide stuff, to 
be sure, but Im going to cover 
more than that. This space will 
be for seniors to reminisce about 
things, like when the football 
team practiced out on the Cut, or
A look in the mailbag reveals 
 nothing, so Ill have to go to 
the next beBt thing, the Person 
On The Street or, rather, The 
Sidewalk. The first question  
What's up with the tennis courts?
According to Jeff Bolton, vice 
president for University Plan
ning, all those earth movers are 
actually evidence of the Univer
sity Center project. The side
walk along the side of the new 
dorm is goingto continue straight 
out and across the Cut. In order 
to do that, the earth bank must 
be built up to put the sidewalk 
on. So, the side toward CFA 
must be removed in order to build 
up the bank nearest Skibo. Once
that part is accomplished, the 
tennis courts will be rebuilt so 
that they are aligned with the 
sidewalk. Hopefully, it will be a 
while before they begin to re
semble a dried up cracked stream 
bed.
Next up is a good one  Can 
one get to the top of Hamerschlag 
Hall? Up there where those stairs 
go? From my experience, thats a 
yes and no question. Yes, it is 
possible to get up there  I have 
an eyewitness on that. But, no, 
you, the civilian, cant get up 
there. The CMU Radio club has 
their antennas up there, so they 
have access for maintenance, but 
there isnt a lot of safety equip
ment, so climbing around the 
stack probably isnt a real bright 
idea.By the way, Hamerschlag 
Hall uBed to house the boiler plant 
for the steam heat to campus, 
and the smokestack was deco
rated to resemble a Greek revival 
piece. There is rumored to be a 
walkway around the top of the 
stack  thats what my eyewit
ness says, but having never been 
up there, I cant say.
So thats it for this week. If you 
know of errors of fact, attribu
tion, geography, or physics in this 
column, please let me know by 
the above mentioned channels or 
drop a line by The Tartan office 
 Laura, the Features Editor 
will let me have it, Im sure. Take 
care and happy trails!

Nobel Prizewinner Herbert Simon speaks
By JASON STREITFIELD
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Nobel Prize-winning profes
sor Herbert Simon spoke at the 
first meeting of the philosophy 
club on Wednesday night at 7 
pm. Approximately 40 people 
crowded Porter Hall 125C in an 
effort to hear him. Simon is fa
mous for his work in the field of 
cognitive science and artificial 
intelligence; however, this lec
ture was dedicated to philoso
phy.
Simons lecture was titled, 
Is philosophy useful, ormerely 
necessary in life and science? 
In the course of the lecture, 
Simon made clear his view that 
philosophy and science are 
closely connected subjects  
they both seek answers to ques
tions. Simon gave his definition 
of philosophy as what philoso
phers do and narrowed down 
his definition further by defin
ing philosophers as people who 
prefer questions to answers. 
Simon made it clear that as a 
scientist, he is a seeker of an
swers, thus driving the point 
home that his is the same job 
that philosophers have.
With the title of the lecture 
that Simon gave, one would ex
pect that he would delve deeply 
into the use and practicality of 
philosophy in science and, for 
that matter, in life. On the con
trary, Simon quickly made it 
understood that his title bore 
no fundamental relation to his 
lecture.
Keeping in touch with the 
tradition of philosophy, Simon 
did not pretend to have all of the
answers. His lecture was in
tended to raise questions 
about the role of philosophy in 
questioning every aspect of 
life, from ethics to politics. 
Simon even refered back to 
Descartesego cogito ergo sum 
(I think therefore I am), ask
ing the fundamental question, 
How can man know reality?
Simon ended his lecture 
with a discussion of the MindBody problem, which is a 
philosophical issue regarding 
how a physical entity, the 
brain, can have mental func
tions, a mind.
Simon used his studies in 
human cognition to facilitate 
this discussion. In particular, 
he spoke about his recent com
puter project, BACON, which 
is a program that is able to 
derive fundamental formulas, 
or truths, from given data. 
Simon conveyed his faith in 
artificial intelligence. Al
though he did not profess to be 
able to prove the validity of 
his view, itis difficult to argue 
with a man of such experience 
and stature.
This lecture on the value of 
philosophy by a leading scien
tist in cognitive science and 
artificial intelligence was any
thing but predictable. While 
not actually answering any of 
philosophys big questions, 
Simon provided an evening 
filled with thought and in
sight.
After the hour lecture was 
over, one easily understood 
that philosophy has as much 
importance in real life as sci
ence does.

The world of virtual reality returns to the CMU campus on J 
January 26 with Artistic Director George Coates, the next" 
speaker in the Presidents Distinguished Lecture Series. Coate^ .j 
production, entitled Invisible Site: A Virtual Show/ combines'! 
art and technology with music and text adapted from sources 
such as Arthur Rimbaud and William Shakespeare to create a 
three-dimensional demonstration which immerses the audi
ence in a virtual world of live performers, computer-aided-, 
imagery, and film.
During the course of the performance, which takes place in a 
fictional chain of virtual reality franchises called the Invisible 
Site, characters are entered into a virtual world via the use of 
sensors worn as helmeted eye goggles and gloves. Participants ' 
are on-line with each other and can play against or with each 
other. Pterodactyl encounter allows the player to fight against , 
dinosaurs in an imaginary prehistoric world. To duplicate the; 
feeling of being on-line for the audience, 3-D glasses will be' 
distributed. It looked like a lot of fun, said sophomore computer science major and Tartan Editorial Board member Chad"* 
McDaniel, who watched the last performance.
There is no charge for the performance, which will be held on'

manhood. The original group 
of men at Lafayette were mem
bers of the Boy Scouts of 
America who took the prin
ciples of scouting to the newly 
formed Alpha Phi Omega. Ini
tially, only Eagle Scouts were 
allowed to pledge the frater
nity. Eventually, this require
ment was dropped; the frater
nity decided that there were 
others beside Scouts who 
should be able to perform acts 
of service.
This same ideology drove the 
move for the national organi
zation to become co-ed in 1976; 
individual chapters were given 
the choice of accepting women 
without the option of returning 
to single sex status or remain
ing exclusively male with the 
option to become co-ed at a later
date. Many chapters included 
women before pledge require
ments were officially changed, 
registering women with the na
tional organization using the 
first initials or masculinized 
versions of their names. Al
though A Phi O is a co-educational organization, it is still 
designated as a fraternity and 
uses the term brother to de
scribe its members. A Phi O 
chooses the term brother be
cause it does not distinguish 
between members on the basis 
of sex.
A Phi O initiates pledge 
classes in both the fall and 
spring semesters. And al
though, as Karen Yun said, the 
fraternity takes a lot of time, 
she loved them [service activi

To gain recognition on cam

take advantage of National Mor

a celebration of Mortar Boards 
75th anniversary. The week be
fore Valentines Day, members 
will be selling carnations to be 
delivered with a message. All 
proceeds will go to the Light of

Also to celebrate the anniver
sary, the members of Mortar 
Board plan to paint the fence 
with their name, motto, and ran
dom graffiti. The group will also 
plant a tree with a plaque to com
memorate the chapters involve

Mortar Board is also co-spon
soring the Last Lecture Series 
this semester. On February 23, a 
local transplant surgeon, Dr. Os

that next years members will 
continue their involvement in 
planning lecture series.
The upcoming seniors that are

The fourth annual A Slice of 
Life program, developed by 
alumni to share with students 
some of the experiences they have 
had since graduating from 
Carnegie Mellon, will kick off 
Career Week 1993 on February 
6. Sponsoredby Alumni Relations 
and organized by junior voice/ 
history major Kristin Carbone, 
the program is geared toward 
juniors and seniors, although all 
members of the campus commu
nity are welcome. The idea of the 
program was to bring students 
and alumni together, said 
Carbone. Alumni are a great re
source." Sessions in the program 
are offered on every subject from 
basic tax preparation to dual ca
reer couples. The program has 
only been slightly modified from 
past years. This year, Total Qual

sessions, teaches the prospective

municator of his ideas without 
being overbearing. Comments on

enthusiastic attendant.

Mad Forest brings Romanian revolution to life
By TINA L. URSO
I Tartan Diversions Editor 
& chad McDaniel
Tartan Systems Manager
On December 21, 1989, the 
I people of Romania joined forces 
with the revolutionary Front 
organization, flooding the streets 
of Bucharest with shouts of 
Down with Ceausescu, their 
Communist dictator of over 20 
years. After four days of chaos 
and confusion in the streets, 
Nicolae Ceausescu and his much[ hated wife Elena were executed 
by the revolutionary forces on 
Christmas Day. Five months later 
I theFrontscandidate,IonIliescu, 
a former high-ranking official un| der Ceausescu, was elected by 
the Romanian people in a land
slide victory. In the ensuing 
months much doubt was raised 
as to the legitimacy of Iliescus 
election, Ceausescus execution, 
and even the revolution itself.
Pittsburgh Public Theaters 
presentation of Mad Forest, which 
is playing now through February 
: 7 in the North Side, offers the 
audience an engaging interpreN tation of these events. This play 
I was written by British playwright 
j Caryl Churchill and directed by 
I Mark Wing-Davey (well-known 
1 for his portrayal of Zaphod 
jBeeblebrox in the BBCs 
{Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy 
1 series). The Pittsburgh producI tion, a joint venture with the BerI keley Repertory Theatre, is the
I sixth since its summer 1990 open|ingin London.
Upon entering the theatre, it
was obvious that Romanian de- rier, even though the play is in ken egg off the floor so that they 
signer Marina Draghici (who also English: each ofthe scenes in this can use it. This first scene is concreated the set and costumes of act begins with a character ap- veyed with no speaking except 
the Obie award-winning New pearing in the theatre reading for the sound of a Romanian song 
York production) took full advan- from a book. They slowly pro- on the radio. Another family, the 
tage of the intimate, three-quar- nounce a phrase describing the Antonescus, are better off; they 
ters stage. Her use of the spaces next scene in Romanian, say it in are only mildly irritated by a 
aboveandaroundtheseatingarea English, and then confidently power failure. The two families 
helped make the audience feel as recite the phrase in Romanian as are tied together by Fiorina 
though they are 
truly within the 
environment of 
the play.
The play is in 
three acts  cor
responding to the 
events before, 
during, and after 
the revolution  
and Churchill 
uses different 
styles for each.
The first act has 
minimal dialogue 
and short scenes 
with quick tran
sitions. The sec
ond act is one long 
scene consisting 
solely of dialogue.
The third act fol
lows a more stan
dard structure.
The minimal 
dialogue of the 
first act conveys 
the oppression 
that the charac
ters feel under 
Ceausescu. Their 
relations are developed and their 
problems revealed instead 
through their actions and expres
sions. A clever technique is used 
to acknowledge the language barcourtosy of Pittsburgh Public Theaterue K.a,apvaTGx Mad Forest ,O5s olTsTOc ,IOTO,saT5 ato/OEeEeS sl sIa OAnEae,a gIaTa sIac gaTa nATEeS

if they had just learned it.
We are introduced to the Vladu 
family, who treasure their Ameri
can cigarettes and, because of 
their poverty, must scrape a broVladu, a nurse, and Radu 
Antonescu, an art student, who 
are engaged to be married.
There is a drastic change with 
the second act as the house lights
are turned on, exposing the audi
ence to the actors (now a new 
group of thick-accented Roma
nians), who proceed to give, di
rectly to the audience members, 
their testimonials about their 
actions duringthe revolution. The 
mood is quite like that of watch
ing a documentary. The tension 
of this act 
builds up as 
the actors 
paint a vivid 
picture ofthe 
confusing 
and violent 
events surroundingthe 
revolution 
and Ceaus
escus execu
tion. One 
particularly 
moving performance 
during this 
sceneis seen 
in Andrew 
Mutnicks 
portrayal of 
a student 
who joined 
in the fight
ing.
The act 
ends with 
this diverse 
group of Rom a ni an s 
joining to
gether in singing an old national
istic song that had been forbid
den during Ceausescus reign. 
The result proves to be very in
spiring, allowing the audience to
share in tho feelings of triumph 
these people must have felt after 
Ceausescu's fall.
During the intermission, tele
visions set up in the lobby show
ing actual news footage from the 
December 1989 Revolution 
heighten the experience of the 
second act, grounding the play in', 
the reality it was based upon.
The third act returns to the 
characters presented in the first 
act, but this time uses more in
volved dialogue and elaborate, 
lively scenes. The act opens with 
a very unusual scene in which a - 
naked man on all fours plays a - 
stray dog, who has a conversa-. 
tion with a vampire. Although 
this scene doesnt seem to ad
vance the plot ofthe Vladu family 
story at all, it holds deep symbol
ism when taken in the context of 
the Dracula legend which origi
nated in Romania.
Another very interesting, but 
seemingly incongruent scene is 
Rodica Has a Nightmare, in 
which Rodica, a member of the 
Vladu family, dreams she is a 
queen who is about to be executed. 
The lighting, sound, and rapidly 
Bwirling sot combine to create a 
very surreal scene.
Aside from these two scenos, 
the restofthis act follows a mostly 
traditional, plot-driven sequence. 
The divisions betweon tho Roma
nian people and the questions 
that they had about the motiva
tions of the revolution were seen 
as the characters were left won

off than before Ceausescus execuPloase see MAD FOREST, page LH
Baltimore Waltz brings AIDS quilt to City Theatre
|By TARA M. SEMAN 
fTartan Contributing Editor
If you doubt that scraps of fabric sewn together 
lean evoke strong emotions, then youve never seen 
|the NAMES Project AIDS Memorial Quilt.
Though the portion of the quilt that is currently 
Ion display in the lobby of the City Theatre on the 
South Side is only a small part of the entire quilt, 
lit is very powerful for its size. The 16 panels on 
display are a tiny portion of the 22,128 panels that 
make up the entire quilt, enough to cover 13 footI ball fields.
The display in the lobby of the City Theatre is 
[very simple. Two sections of eight panels hang 
from the wall. In front of the sections is a table set 
with a flower arrangement, a picture of the entire 
[quilt spread out, one bowl of the red ribbons that 
have come to represent AIDS awareness, a box of 
tissues, and another bowl for donations. Off to the 
|side, there is another table with more information 
boutAIDS.HTV, and the quilt project. Each panel 
s a work of art and love. Six of the panels are for 
people from Pennsylvania, mostly from Pittsburgh. 
Some of the panels are very simple while others 
very ornate and complex. The panel for a 
lerson named Rikk depicts a tropical scene com
plete with volcano and palm trees; it also includes 
he dates, 1959-1987. Allen James panel is in
scribed with the dates, 1958-1988, and features 
lorful birds in flight. A turquoise background 
fithblackletteringthatreads Ray Sprankle 8/25/ 
-10/29/86 Tyrone, PA and three torches make 
up the panel for one of the people from PennsylvaGold letters and an artificial rose on a beige 
ftckground make up the panel for Skipp, along 
*ith the inscription, Skipp  my first friend, you
rose-tinted my world, ill remember...  Patrick. 
All That Chaz within a flower border with the 
dates, 3/29/49-7/4/89, is the theme of the panel for 
Charles T. Harper. The panel for Leonard Harris,
m
 hEag lr O// 37 oOea/5 lr sIa nE5o/Oci
1eC s panel is a ramuy enon.
which features his name in black letters on a white 
background with a border of hearts and a birds in 
flight design sewn in white against the white 
background, is eloquent inits simplicity. The panel 
for Pittsburgh native, Rob, looks like it was a 
family effort. It features the inscription, Beloved 
son 2/15/57-5/14/89. The panel depicts a scene in 
a park complete with stick figures flying kites. The 
sun has Mom & Dad" sewn on it; the balloons held 
by the stick people spell uncle; and the flowers spell 
brother.
A large Grease logo and the statement, Tim 
received a Tony nomination for creating the role of 
Kenickie in Broadways Grease are prominent in 
the panel for Tim Meyers. Meyers panel also 
features the dates, 1945-1989 and written mes
sages from friends and 
family. The panel for 
Bill H. Callahan, 
M.S.W., is comprised of 
a bar of music complete 
with colorful notes, the 
words One Day At A 
Time, the dates 12/3/ 
47-6/28/88, and a pink 
triangle in the corner.
Among the more un
usual panels are the 
panels for David Lutz, 
Barry D. Hall, Keith W. 
Aurand, Patrick 
OHara, and Karl Gier. 
A painted portrait 
against the white back
ground is the focal point 
of the panel for Lutz, 
12/24/55-10/9/88. Halls 
panel is done in the tra
ditional patchwork de
sign with his name and 
thg dates, 1957-1986,in
pastel patchwork against a darker patchwork 
background. Afavoritejacketfrom ButlerTrucking Co. with an ID bracelet around one of the 
sleeves and a baseball cap with the slogan, 
GMC Diesel Power, 
sewn to a blue flannel 
background make up the 
panel for Aurand. A 
drawing of a man leaning 
against his motorcycle 
against a bright pink 
backgroundisdepictedin 
the panel for OHara of 
Pittsburgh.
Atouchinginscription, 
Out of the darkness of 
our sorrow we light this 
flame in affirmation of 
the brave and loving 
spirit of Karl. We have 
felt the courage with 
which Karl struggled to defeat and then to en
dure his illness. We have seen Karls many 
generous and kind-hearted deeds. We have heard 
the words of understanding and compassion 
that he offered to others. There is warmth in the 
light we kindle, the warmth of Karls love and 
caring. There is radiance in the light we kindle, 
the radiance of Karls courage and resolution, 
describes Gier, 3/19/59-9/22/87, in his panel,

On the Mark plays 
at Tilted Square
By JENNIFER URSO
Tartan Photo Editor
On the Mark, a folk music group consisting 
mostly of CMU graduate students and alumni 
performed at the Tilted Square on Friday, Janu
ary 22 at 8 pm.
For all of you who wanted to have a quiet evening '. 
with some friends, the Tilted Square was the place 
to be. Although most of the audience was older, 
consisting of graduate students and their friends, 
and they sang a song that expressed their misunderstanding of the young people today, their mu
sic was, on the whole, enjoyable for people of all
Jennifer Ureo/Tartan Photo Editor 
Fe sIa POTH oaTrlTp5 rlT ,lrraaIlA5a ,Tlgni
ages who appreciate folk music.
On The Mark has a wide variety of instrumental 
talents, including the hammer dulcimer, guitar, 
recorder, flute, and numerous types of percussion. 
They handled these instruments very well, with 
each member switching back and forth between 
instruments and vocals.
The pieces that were mainly acoustic were the 
best of the bunch and sounded a lot like authentic 
Irish folk music. Its a shame, though, that their 
singing voices didnt live up to their playing abil
ity. The instrumental music performed was very 
relaxing and harmonic, but their voices just werent 
at the same level.
The group is comprised of Marion Kee (philoso
phy), Kathy Van Stone (CS PhD candidate), Monica ; 
Cellio (psychology/CS staff), Andrea Gansley (staff, 
EDRC), and non-student Robert Smith.
On The Mark, despite their vocal shortcomings, 
manage to pull something off very well. They 
manage to preserve a type of music that gets 
somewhat lost in all the labels of music nowadays. 
Folk music was big in the 60s, then came acid rock, 
disco, the unfortunate 80s, and finally all of the 
different, hard-to-define categories of today. Folk 
music has remained easily definable and On The 
Mark has managed to keep this music what it is 
without cheesing out and giving in to the publics 
demands for dissimilar types of music.

The Bicycle Thief
Bored with LA Law? The Bicycle Thief may be 
just the film for you. Director Vittorio De Sica 
(Indiscretion of an American Wife; The Gold of 
Naples; Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow) crafts 
what critics consider to be an all-time black and 
white classic.
Its the story of the search for the bicycle that 
is vital to a bill poster and his sons livelihood. 
The theft is reported to the police, who do noth
ing. So the bill poster and his son take matters 
into their own hands and scour Rome looking for 
the missing bicycle and its thief.
Starring Lamberto Maggiorani, Lianella 
Camell, and Enzo Stalola, The Bicycle Thief is in 
Italian with English subtitles.
At 6, 8,10 pm, midnight.
Friday, January 29
Raging Bull
Director Martin Scorsese (Color of Money, The 
Last Temptation of Christ, Taxi Driver) scores 
with Raging Bull. It stars Robert De Niro as prize 
fighter Jake La Motta. For this role, De Niro 
gained 60 pounds to transform himself into La 
Motta from his twenties to middle age. De Niro 
doesnt play La Motta; he becomes La Motta.
The film is based on the life of La Motta, who 
came from the slums of the Bronx and became a 
middleweight boxing champion in the 1940s, 
who made and squandered millions of dollars, 
became a pathetic stand-up comedian, and spent 
time in prison for corrupting the morals of an 
underage girl.
It also stars Cathy Moriarty (Soapdish), Joe 
Pesci (My Cousin Vinny, Home Alone), Theresa 
Saldana (of TVs The Commish), Nicholas 
Colasanto (Fat City, Mad Bull), and Frank 
Vincent.
Filmed in black and white to add to the gritti
ness, dont pass this film up.
At 5:45, 8,10:15 pm, 12:30 am.
Saturday, January 30
Under Siege
Under Siege is the latest action flick starring 
Steven Seagal (of Hard To Kill fame). This non
stop action fest pits Seagal against Tommy Lee 
Jones (JFK, Black Moon Rising, Coal Miners 
Daughter).
A group of terrorists led by Jones capture the 
U.S. battleship Missouri in order to obtain the 
nuclear warheads the ship carries. Seagal mi
raculously escapes being drugged like the rest of 
the crew and becomes the only man aboard who 
can save the day.
If youre up for lots of action, Under Siege is the 
film for you. I doubt Saturday night TV can 
promise such violence.
At 6, 8,10 pm, midnight.
Sunday, January 31
The Beat Generation
Steve Cochran stars as a police detective hunt
ing a rapist in this 1959 Carl Haas film. The 
rapist, a wealthy young man known as the 
Aspirin Kid, considers himself mentally supe
rior and above the law.
To prove this, the kid picks the detectives wife, 
Fay Spain (of Dragstrip Girl) as his next victim. 
Mamie Van Doren has a bit part as a would be 
victim. Jackie Coogan, playing Cochrans part
ner, appears in drag while staking out lovers 
lane.
Vampira (of late night TV and Plan 9 from 
Outer Space fame) plays a poetess, and Louis 
Armstrong and his band perform on screen.
The Beat Generation is coffeehouse fun for all 
with plenty of wacky beatniks, bad poetry, bad 
art, and, no doubt, bad acting.
At 6, 8,10 pm, midnight.

Hexed surpasses expectations
By JENNIFER TURNER
Tartan Staffwriter
A billboard of a really ugly 
woman. The eyes open as the 
camera backs up. They close 
again. This is the opening of the 
movie Hexed.
Does it sound bad so far? Well, 
it gets better. Much better, in 
fact. Hexed is a hysterical movie, 
though some of the jokes are of 
the sort that are only fanny once. 
When you see it, youll know what 
I mean. And if you want a good 
laugh, youll see it.The openingis 
stupid, and the premise predict
able, but the overall result ends 
up being neither.
Ive told you about the opening. 
The basic premise: Matthew 
(Arye Gross) is a hotel clerk with 
a small bank account, a great 
imagination, and an even bigger 
obsession with the world-famous 
model, Hexina (Claudia Chris
tian). He even goes so far as to 
doctor a picture (albeit badly) to 
convince his co-worker Gloria 
(Adrian Shelley) that he knows
Hexina.
His wildest dreams come true 
when the hotel manager informs 
him that Hexina will bo coming 
to stay at the hotel. When she 
arrives, he uses his imperson
ation skills to convince her that 
he is the man she is supposed to 
meet that evening.
At this point, you may be think
ing to yourself, Yeah, yeah, yeah, 
seen it hundreds of times before. 
He meets Hexina. They have a 
great time. And then....
But this is the point where the 
script diverges from the formula 
(for the most part, anyway) and 
the real fan begins.
After they have incredible sex, 
Hexina tries to kill Matthew. It 
seems the guy he was imperson
ating was a blackmailing scum
bag. From this point on, the movie 
defies convention and begins op
erating under a new premise. 
Hexina is a total psycho, and 
Matthew is lucky to get away 
from her with his life.
Complicating the story are 
Matthews co-worker, Gloria, and 
his supervisor, Simon (Michael 
Knight). In the one predictable 
plot thread, Gloria pines after 
Matthew and wonders why he 
insists on living in a dream world.
Simon, who spends most of the 
movie trying to figure out what 
his next move will be to rid him
self of Matthew and his pre
tentions, affects the plot in unex
pected ways and londs to the over
all humor of the movie without 
seeming stereotypical. This can 
mostly be attributed to the acting 
of Knight. His impeccablo timing 
and facial expressions give life to 
an otherwise two-dimensional 
character.
Gross and Christian both give 
good performances and have a 
chemistry that is undeniable. 
Christian sizzles in the love 
scenes, and her voice is remark
ably similar to KathleenTumers.
Norman Fell (the hotel man
ager, Herschel Levine) makes 
several plot-advancing appear
ances providing moviegoers with 
more laughs.
The ending of the movie turns 
out to be predictable, but the ride 
there is a series of ups and downs, 
starts and stops and hilariously 
funny. Its a satire in some spots, 
a parody in others, but always 
funny in a dark sort of way.
Well, maybe not always. But 
often enough to make me think 
that this movie is worth seeing. 
So go ahead.
Spend six bucks, or three-fifty 
(if you can get up that early on a 
Saturday). Either way, youll have 
fun and spend a little time off 
campus. Arent you a little tired 
of DH 2210?

Revolution at The Public
MAD FOREST from L9
tion. This was most clearly ex
pressed by a man, presumed to be 
mad by the others, whose shouts 
of Who was shooting on the 
22nd?! (the date the army sup
posedly joined the revolution) 
prompted members of the Vladu 
family to admit their own misgiv
ings about the event.
The tension of the Romanian 
people culminates with a fight at 
Radu and Fiorinas wedding re
ception.
Mad Forest transforms the de
tached headlines of the Roma
nian revolution into a powerful, 
personal experience that the en
tire audience can share in.
The American actors convinc
ingly portray the feelings of the 
Romanian people through their
performances. This combined 
with Wing-Davey's expert direct
ing and Draghicis design make 
Mad Forest a play that is bound 
to be one of the best of the year.
The Public will be runningAiad 
Forest now through Sunday, Feb
ruary 7. Performances are at 8 
pm Tuesday through Saturday 
and at 7 pm Sunday, with mati
nees on January 30 and Febru
