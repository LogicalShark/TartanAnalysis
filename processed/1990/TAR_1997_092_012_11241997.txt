CMUs capital campaign, four 
years under way, was publicly 
announced to the Pittsburgh 
community this Monday in the 
Alcoa building downtown. So far, 
the University has collected 
$227.8 million in contributions, 
said President Jared Cohon. The 
campaign, which will conclude 
in 2000, aims to raise $350 mil
lion for the endowment, faculty 
chairs, and student scholarships.
Our goal hopes to be achieved 
by November 15 in the year 2000,
said Charles Queehan, chairman 
of the Board of Trustees.
Fifty percent of the funds will 
be pt towards endowed schol
arships, professorships and 
other long-term support, 30 per
cent for specific projects and 
programs, 15 percent to sup
port building projects such as 
renovations to undergraduate 
science laboratories, the 
Purnell Center, and the comple
tion of Roberts Engineering 
Hall, and five percent to sup
port strategic initiatives. The 
current market value of CMUs 
endowment is reported to be 
$592.1 million.
Our endowment is much 
smaller than those Universities
with which we compete and 
those Universities with which 
we plan to compete in the fu
ture, said Cohon.
Carnegie Mellons endowment 
has grown significantly over the 
past several years, but it remains 
much lower than those of its com
petitors, said Queenan.
[We are looking for] more con
tributions on the individual level, 
because it is chiefly alumni of a 
university who are most likely to 
support the objectives of this cam
paign, said chairman of the board 
Queenan.
Contributions to the cam
paign to date include $18 mil
lion from the Heinz Endow
ments, $7.9 million from Intel
Corporation, $3.4 million from 
the R.K. Mellon Foundation, 
$2.5 million from Robert 
Eberly and the Eberly Family 
Trust, and $1 million gifts from 
Allegheny Teledyne Inc., 
Dusquesne Light Co., General 
Motors Corporation and 
Mellon Bank.
We want to make sure we are 
a University accessible to stu
dents who do not have the means 
to attend a University like 
Carnegie Mellon, said Cohon. So 
that means we need another 
source of income  endowment.
To keep any university going, 
an endowment is really key, said 
Ted Johnson, chief executive of
ficer of The NPD Group.Student vote results in fee increase
By DANIEL ARP
Tartan News Editor
By a margin of almost four to 
one, students passed a referen
dum to increase both the graduate 
and undergraduate Activities Fee 
30 percent  from $50 to $65 per 
semester  in a secret ballot last 
Thursday and Friday.
Amongst students, 79.9 percent 
voted yes and 20.1-percent voted - 
no in the election. The turnout 
was just over nine percent of eli
gible voters  about 11 percent of 
undergraduates and five percent 
of graduates.
This is a major hurdle, said 
Will Toraason, Senate chair and a 
junior physics major. Tm happy 
that such an overwhelming major
ity [of students] supported [the 
referendum].
A vote was necessary on the Sen
ate proposal for an increase be
cause Senate bylaws stipulate that 
any increase over five percent must 
be approved by the student popu
lation.
I think a lot of [students] might 
not have cared too much either 
way, so they chose not to vote, said 
Bryon Krug, student body presi
dent and a junior electrical and 
computer engineering major.

ing major, voted in favor of the 
referendum. Im just interested in 
seeing student organizations de
velop and [in] nurturing the give 
and take relationship between cam
pus organizations and the student 
body, he said.
But Id say that the 
people who had strong feelings 
on this subject did come out and 
vote, and the results were 
pretty convincing.
Paul Constantinides, a senior 
electrical and computer engineerI dont see it as a bad idea to 
raise the Activities Fee by only 
fifteen dollars [a semester], and it 
doesnt happen that often, said 
Ann Madeiros, a sophomore unde
cided H&SS student who also voted 
for the referendum.
I voted against it because a lot of 
people dont see the Activities Fee 
in the first place, said Brian Tobin, 
a sophomore undecided H&SS stu
dent.
The increase is not officially 
passed yet  it must first be ap
proved by Student Senate and 
GSA, which Krug said is for the 
most part a formality. Then next 
spring, student government will 
bring the resolution before the 
Board ofTrustees, which will make 
the final decision.
Tdbe very surprised ifthe Board 
of Trustees made a decision that 
was opposed to the wishes of 80 
percent of the students that took 
the time to vote, said Krug.
The question Senate will now 
face is what to do with the new 
money. The Activities Fee funds 
may be used not only to fund stu
dent organizations but special 
projects as well, such as the cur
rent student effort to convert the 
now-vacant Morewood Basement

IFC elects president
By ENA KHAN
Tartan Managing Editor
The self-governing body for CMU 
fraternities, the InterFraternity 
Council (IFC), elected new officers 
last Thursday. Avinash Jain, a junior 
Industrial management major, who 
resigned from his position as Risk 
Manager last September, was elected 
the new president. The new board 
members will take office during the

said Jain.
As president, Jains primary

Fire in Cyert halts Andrew system
By JAYA SAXENA
Tartan Staffwriter
A small fire in Cyert Hall shut off the 
Andrew network for over three hours 
last Tuesday, temporarily backing up 
incoming email and disabling student 
accounts.
At approximately 10:30 am, a device 
unrelated to the network caught on fire 
in the building, according to Charles
Bartell, Computing Services director of 
operations. Once activated, the alarm 
system automatically powered off the 
electricity, disrupting most computing 
services including Andrew file servers 
and networking and mail services, said 
John Lerchey, senior consultant of Com
puting Services. The fire was quickly 
put out and Computing Services was 
able to restore most services by 2 pm 
that afternoon. No permanent damage

or injuries were reported.
This was kind of a big deal around 
here. It makes us realize how depen
dent we are on computers and the net
works, Bartell said.
The biggest thing was that this is the 
most technologically advanced univer
sity in the world. All of a sudden, people 
seemed unable to communicate^ 
said Brian Boyars, a junior chemical 
engineering major and CCon.
There were reports that the fire was 
actually caused by a hot dog which 
exploded in a microwave.
I stopped one administrator and 
asked him what happened, somebody 
I recognized from computing services, 
said Marshall Warfield, a senior cre
ative writing major who was in Cyert 
at the time of the fire. [Ed. Note: 
Marshall Warfield is The Tartan Dos
sier Literary Editor.] He said [it was] 
a small fire. And I asked what caused 
it, and he said [it was] a hot dog in 
a microwave.
People were definitely concerned, 
but it was also kind of funny, and men 
were shaking their heads as they were 
moving a big exhaust fan to pull the 
smoke out of Cyert, said Warfield.
Bartell would not comment about 
the specific cause of the fire, but he 
said the piece of equipment has been 
removed from Cyert and will not be 
replaced.

Woman gives birth to
seven children In Eowa
DES MOINES, Iowa (AP)  After
 visiting his seven new babies, all pink 
; and chubby-cheeked, beaming father 
} Kenny McCaughey had just one word
 Thursday to describe his overwhelm ing good fortune: Wow!
McCaugheys wife, Bobbi, gave birth 
! Wednesday to four boys and three girls 
  only the second set of septuplets 
' known to be born alive.
This is one of the most blessed 
\ events that Ive ever encountered, 
said McCaughey, who repeatedly 
referred to God during a news con
ference at his church in the family 
hometown of Carlisle. We were 
just ecstatic.
Ever since the babies 
were born, McCaughey and 
his family have been the 
focus of worldwide atten
tion, followed by throngs of 
reporters and well-wishers
 even getting a call Thurs
day from President Clinton. 
McCaughey said his fear 
, was that the birth would 
I turn into a big show.
God could have given us 
one, but God entitled to give 
us seven, and that is my 
commission as a father to 
raise them and to tiy to raise 
them in a normal, Christian 
home, he said.
The newborns, delivered 
nine weeks early, remained 
in serious condition with respiratory 
ailments at Blank Childrens Hospi! tal, but doctors were upbeat about 
their progress. Our high expecta
tions include not only surviving but 
thriving, said Dr. Robert Shaw, a 
neonatologist at the hospital. He said 
the babies were warm, pink, and 
comfortable.
The babiesKenneth Robert, Alexis 
May, Natalie Sue, Kelsey Ann, Bran
don James, Nathanial Roy and Joel 
Steven  were all born in the 2-3 
pound range.
Mrs. McCaughey, 29, who had been 
confined to a bed for more than five 
months, was in good condition and
spent a brief time with the newborns 
Thursday. But neither parent has yet 
held their new children.
Ive just barely touched them, 
McCaughey said. I dont want to pick 
them up yet. Theyre just still on their 
breathers and monitors and everything, 
and probably will be for quite a little bit 
of time.
The infants remained in the infant 
intensive care unit as doctors and 
nurses carefully monitor their 
progress. They eventually will be 
placed in incubators.

medical director, said babies born pre

maturely typically go home around 
their original due date, or late Janu
ary for the McCaugheys.
The babies were the result of fertil
ity drugs used to help Mrs. McCaughey 
ovulate. The couple, citing their reli
gious convictions, had decided against 
aborting some of the fetuses, a proce
dure used to improve the survival 
chances of the others.
There has been an outpouring of sup
port for the couple, she a former seam

at a Carlisle car dealership. The deal
ership gave them a van, a home builder 
offered a house, and La Grange College 
offered full college scholarships.
Iraq ends three 
weeks of defiance
BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP)Iraq on Thurs
day agreed to allow U.S. arms inspectors 
back into the country.
Iraq and Russia have reached an agree
ment for all weapons inspectors to come 
back and for Russia to work for the 
lifting of U.N. Security Council sanc
tions on Iraq, the official Iraqi news 
agency reported. The statement carried 
by the agency was issued in the form of 
a joint communiqu between Russia and 
the government of Iraqi President 
Saddam Hussein.
An agreement has been reached that 
Iraq will accept the return of the Special 
Commission in its entirety and the re
sumption of its work starting today, 
November 20,1997, said the text of the 
statement. It said that Russia on its 
part will participate to implement U.N. 
resolutions related to the quick lifting of 
the sanctions and especially the imple
mentation of article 22 of resolution 687.
That section of the resolution, adopted 
in 1991 after the Iraqis invaded Ku
wait, says that once the United Nations 
certifies that Iraqs weapons of mass 
destruction are eliminated, the Secu
rity Council will order the lifting of the 
sanctions, which block Iraq from ex
porting its oil. Iraqs National Assem
bly, or parliament, went into session 
Thursday morning to discuss the agree
ment and presumably  because it is 
controlled by the ruling Arab Socialist 
Baath Party  to give its approval.
The sanctions cannot be lifted until 
the arms inspectors certify that Iraq has 
destroyed all weapons of mass destruc
tion and the means to make others.
Iraq insists it has already met the 
requirement, but the chief weapons in
spector, Australian Richard Butler, has 
accused the Iraqis of hiding weapons 
and materials for making them.
Hutu rebels free 
jailed comrades
KIGALI, Rwanda (AP)  Hutu rebels 
trying to free their comrades attacked a 
prison in northwestern Rwanda and burned 
down a courtroom, killingnearly300people, 
a military spokesman said Thursday.
At least 200 rebels, 88 prisoners, and 
two soldiers died in Mondays clash about
40 miles northwest of Kigali, army 
spokesman Richard Sizibera said.
The army was pursuing 93 prisoners 
who escaped and any survivors of the rebel 
force, estimated at 1,500 men, he said.
The rebels  armed with automatic 
rifles, machetes, and spearsattacked 
the prison under cover of darkness, 
Sizibera said. They had two motives: 
freeing their comrades and burning 
down the court.
In a separate incident, at least 27 
civilians were killed Monday by sus
pected rebels in the nearby village of 
Mukamara, Sizibera said. The attacks 
occurred in an area where Hutu rebels 
have repeatedly attacked Tutsi soldiers 
and survivors of a 1994 Hutu-led geno
cide in which more than 500,000 people 
were killed. Most victims were minority 
Tutsis and moderate Hutus.
The inmates at Giciye were among 
thousands of Hutus who are jailed in 
Rwanda awaiting trial on charges of 
carrying out the genocide.
The slaughter ended after three 
months when Tutsi rebels chased Hutu 
officials, soldiers and civilians  more 
than 1 million in all  across the border 
to Zaire, now renamed Congo.
Some of the soldiers returned with refu
gees to Rwanda late last year, while an 
unknown number are hidden in forests 
alongthe Congo-Rwanda border. The gov
ernment estimates at least 15,000 rebels 
are based in northwest Rwanda.
Gunmen murder 
seventh journalist
BOGOTA, Colombia (AP)Two gun
men on a motorcycle killed a magazine 
editor Thursday in the regional capital 
of Armenia, authorities said, bringing 
the number of Colombian journalists 
murdered this year to seven.
Jairo Elias Marquez, editor-in-chief of 
the monthly news magazine El Marques, 
was about to get into his car when he 
was gunned down in the city 120 miles 
west of Bogota.
An Armenia police spokesman told 
local reporters that Marquez, 40, had 
received telephoned death threats but 
that it was not clear from whom. 
Marquezs magazine had backed Henry 
Gomez Tabares, who on October 26 was 
elected governor of Quindio state, in the 
heart of Colombias coffee region.
Late last month, the dismembered 
body of another journalist, Alejandro
Jaramillo, was found in the southern 
regional capital of Pasto, near the Ecua
dor border.
On November 11, the owner of a radio 
station in the small town of Majagual, 
Francisco Castro, was shot to death in 
his home by gunmen.
Marquez was the 70th journalist 
killed in this country over the past nine 
years, according to the Inter-American 
Press Association.
Malaysia sets up 
news committee
KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP)  
Malaysia has set up a committee to watch 
for any inaccuracies in foreign reports 
about the nation carried on the Internet.
We will decide on the appropriate 
action to correct any wrong perceptions 
in the reports, T^hgku Alaudin Abdul 
Majid told The Star in an interview 
published Wednesday. He is deputy secretary-general of the Culture, Arts and 
Tourism Ministry.
Malaysia has criticized some reports 
as inaccurate, including one six months 
ago that said people were killed while 
working on a dam project in Sarawak 
state on Borneo Island. The government 
says no one was killed or injured.
Meanwhile, Information Minister 
Mohamed Rahmat said he would meet 
with officials of Cable News Network 
next week to complain about scenes it 
televised on the haze that has hung over 
Southeast Asia for months. I hope they 
will replace these visuals with those 
reflecting the actual situation now in 
Malaysia where the haze has cleared, 
the national news agency Bernama 
quoted him as saying.
In Atlanta, CNN spokeswoman Lori 
Konopka said she knew of no such meet
ing, but defended the networks coverage.
CNN covered the condition which ex
isted over the region just like we would any 
other news story around the world. We did 
have government spokespeople as well as 
environmental experts, and we stand by 
our reports as being fair, she said.
Malaysian officials have blamed a de
cline in tourism on media reports car
ried worldwide on the haze, which was 
caused by Indonesian forest fires.
Monsoon rains have cleared away 
much of the polluting, health-threatening smog, meteorologists in Singapore 
said Wednesday.
INXS lead singer commits suicide just days before anniversary tour
SYDNEY, Australia (AP)  
INXS lead singer Michael 
Hutchence apparently commit
ted suicide Saturday at a Sydney 
hotel, leaving fellow band mem
bers waiting at a rehearsal stu
dio where they were preparing 
for the rock groups 20th-anniversary tour.
A worker at the Ritz Carlton 
found the body shortly before noon 
after Hutchence failed to appear 
for a morning appointment with 
the Australian Broadcasting 
Corp. Hutchences father and girl
friend Paula Yates confirmed it 
was the 37-year-old singer.
Australian TV stations and 
the Australian Associated Press
reported that Hutchence was 
found hanged.
Investigators removed a 
leather belt from the scene. No 
illegal drugs were found, al
though there were a number 
of prescription medications, 
Inspector Christopher Hogg 
said. An autopsy will be carried 
out Monday.
The death of the singer 
prompted daylong radio tributes 
to INXS, which sold 20 million 
records since 1981, peaking in 
the late 1980s.
The rest of the band released a 
statement Sunday: The band 
members of INXS are all in ex
treme shock at the loss of their
dear friend and lead singer 
Michael Hutchence.
The statement gave no clue as 
to why Hutchence may have com
mitted suicide.
Police inspector Dennis Smith 
said detectives had interviewed a 
family friend who spoke to 
Hutchence about three hours be
fore his body was found.
The woman told police she had 
arranged to meet the singer later 
in the day, Smith said.
Rock music commentator Ian 
Molly Meldrum said 
Hutchences death came as a 
complete surprise. I saw 
Michael and Paula with their 
baby daughter in Los Angeles
around about eight weeks ago, 
and Ive never seen Michael 
more peaceful and happier in 
his life, he said.
Hutchence had flown from his 
London home to Sydney earlier 
this week to prepare for the bands 
20th anniversary Lose Your 
Head tour, which was to start 
Tuesday. It has been cancelled.
Record sales for the group had 
fallen in recent years, but 
Hutchence remained a celebrity in 
Australia, largely because of his 
high-profile romances with Aus
tralian pop star Kylie Minogue, 
model Helena Christensen, and 
Yates, the former wife of rock star 
Bob Geldof.

students, and the residents who 
lived in the halls were furious. 
They passed around a petition in 
order to block the proposed reno
vations. The students were 
mostly concerned because of the 
higher rates that would be 
charged once the halls were con

were confident that the plans

fraternity houses were also fined 
for various violations of fire

damages cannot be assessed to 
one person, the resulting costs 
should be distributed among all 
the residents of the building in 
which the damage occurred. The 
policy still exists today.
ONE YEAR AGO, November

OLR glitches stall students
By RYAN SCHILLING
Tartan Assistant News Editor
Members of the online regis
tration (OLR) team dont know 
exactly what happened to cause 
the frustrating delays sopho
mores experienced while register
ing for classes last Wednesday.
At 6 am, as 960 sophomores 
logged on to register, the server 
stopped functioning properly.
We had tested up to 6,000 vir
tual users on the server, said 
Martha Baron of administration, 
computing, and informational 
services. As you drive that num
ber up to 900, you definitely see a 
drop in performance, but nothing 
like we saw on Wednesday. 
Baron also said that similar loads
still on their computers trying 
to register or were trying to get 
in touch with their advisors 
for assistance.
I was awake and trying to log 
on to the system at 6 [am]. I didnt 
even get to type in my Andrew ID 
and password until well past 8 
[am], said Traber Campbell, a 
sophomore electrical and com
puter engineering major.
Erin Burr, also a sophomore 
ECE major, didnt have quite as 
much trouble. It was still pain
ful, she said. The pages loaded 
incredibly slowly, but somehow 
I got registered for all my classes 
before 7 [am]. Later I tried help
ing some friends register and 
realized how lucky I was.
We saw lots of variation in

were seen at 6:00 am on Monday 
and Tuesday.
The feedback we had been get
ting [before Wednesday] was ec
static. We were very pleased with 
ourselves up to that point, to say 
the least, said Bill Elliot, vice 
president for enrollment and 
member of the OLR team. And 
then the world, fell through.
Instead of getting their classes 
in the 5-10 minutes the OLR team 
expected, students spent hours 
staring at blank Webpages, timed 
out operations, or document con
tains no data errors. Many stu
dents were even forced to miss 
classes because they were either
performance which we carit ex
plain, said Baron. Some 
got through quickly, while 
most didnt.
The OLR team said that the 
server was restarted several 
times that morningwhich also 
contributed to further delays for 
students  but they saw no im
provements in performance.
OLR consists of two servers. 
The first is a web server which 
provides users with the web 
pages. The second, the database 
server, communicates with the 
web server to find out students 
identities, what classes they have 
taken, what their majors are, and
what pre-requisites they 
have fulfilled.
The problem, say OLR officials, 
rests with the database server. 
It was a hardware error, Baron 
said. Because a system file had 
been corrupted, it couldnt write 
to one of the hard drives. The 
web server was stuck waiting for 
the database server, causing 
the delays.
The OLR team, along with a 
group of over thirty experts from 
DataCom, the Software Engi
neering Institute, Computing 
Services, the Computer Science 
Department, and the Electrical 
and Computer Engineering De
partment, were able to resolve 
the problem late Thursday night. 
We were able to rebuild the disk 
from scratch by transferring the 
data to a temporary drive, for
matting the disk, and transfer
ring the information back [to the 
original disk], said Baron.
We wanted the students to 
know that we do not think this 
is a trivial issue, said Elliott. 
We have a process that has 
worked successfully, but some
thing external occurred so that 
we were not able to duplicate 
that [on Wednesday].
When asked if the OLR team 
was concerned that this type of 
error could occur again, Baron 
said they were not. Hewlett 
Packard [the manufacturer of 
the disk] had never seen any
thing like this, he said. Out
side of the power failure [which 
shut down Andrew temporarily 
the day before], they could not 
give us any idea as to what could 
have happened. Were confident 
that this was an isolated and 
random event.
The server went through ex
tensive testing on Friday. There 
werent a lot of students online 
to test it, said Darlene 
LaBarbera of enrollment ser
vices, also a member of the OLR 
team. Our records show that by 
Friday, most of the seniors, jun
iors, sophomores, and grad stu
dents had done their business.
Until we actually see 900 
people log on again, we wont 
know for sure, said Baron. 
Freshmen students begin 
registration today.
BOC, TOC committees try to reconcile differences
By DANIEL ARP
Tartan News Editor
Tensions between organiz
ers of CMUs two major an
nual job recruitment confer
ences prompted the assem
bly of a town hall meeting 
last Thursday.
Organizers of the Business 
Opportunities Conference 
(BOC) and Technical Opportu
nities Conference (TOC)both 
of which bring national corpo
rations and companies to cam
pus  met with representa
tives from the Career Center as 
well as interested students to 
discuss cooperation problems.
We couldnt establish com
munication on [an 
adequate] level be
tween our two 
events, said Ryan 
Kruger, a junior in
dustrial manage
ment maj or and B O C 
chair. Questions _
were coming up, and 
finally I decided, g 
Enough of this bull, 
and got some people together to 
try and talk about it.
For the past two years, the 
conferences have taken place 
on consecutive days and in the 
same location. According to 
Kruger, TOC leaders originally 
told him and the Career Center 
that they would hold next years 
event on September 18. Then, 
without informing him or the 
Career Center, he claims, they 
booked the UC gym for Sep
tember 25 and 26.
First of all, having the BOC 
the day after the TOC is not 
tradition, said Teresa Dietrich, 
a junior industrial manage
ment major and society of 
women engineers TOC chair
person, in an interview after 
the meeting.
We did not feel we were ob
ligated to clear our date with 
the BOC. As for the Career Cen
ter they were and are aware 
of our plans.
At the meeting, Kruger brought 
up the ideat that employers who 
attend both conferences are get
ting a bad impression of the uni
versity when they notice the lack 
of cooperation.
The events reinforce that 
image ... that CMU students 
dont know how to communi
cate, he said.
Dietrich asked Kruger where 
he was getting his feedback from. 
I have not had a single company 
that has said ... we [are in] com
petition, she said. [Employers 
have told us] We like coming to 
these events.
Adrienne Messenger, vice 
president of the Society of 
Women Engineers and a junior
Questions were coming up, 
and finally I decided, Enough 
of this bull.
 Ryan Kruger, BOC Chair
in civil and environmental engi
neering, said that she had heard 
complaints from certain compa
nies, including IBM.
I do get lots of questions about 
both events, said Anne Shields, 
director of the Career Center. Re
cruiters see us as one ... and they 
dont understand and dont expect 
those events to be separate.
There are companies that I 
know that were concerned with 
when our current conferences were 
scheduled.
Id like to speak for the TOC 
and say that I think we kind of feel 
like were being watched, being 
hovered over, because weve been 
the most successful [of the two 
conferences], said Dietrich. I did 
everything in my power [at this 
years event]... not to hurt either 
one of us.
I do think that we need to in
crease our communication, said 
Becky Cassler, a junior civil and 
environmental engineering ma
jor and TOC organizer. But she 
added, We can all be successful 
on our own.
Kruger agreed that the con
ferences should retain their au
tonomy.
I think that the existing sys
tem works well, he said. But 
if we could at least talk to each 
other and have coordination 
wed all be a lot better off.
At the end of the meeting, 
attendees decided another 
meeting would be necessary to 
iron out scheduling issues for 
next year.
Its the beginning of what I 
think does need to happen, 
said Shields. I think you need 
to ... try to find a way to close 
the gap.
I was excited 
that there was go
ing to be continued 
communication.
I think it went 
very well, not only 
because the differ
ent groups decided 
to work more 
closely together, 
but because we brought some of 
the issues to light to the student 
body, and people not previously 
involved with these events had 
the opportunity to express their 
opinions, said Kruger.
I feel the meeting went well 
but the majority of people at
tending were people involved 
with the BOC, said Dietrich. 
I do believe there was some 
progress made but since we 
were not formally notified or 
invited to it, we  the TOC 
organizers  felt we were on 
the defensive.
We are willing to cooperate, 
but at this time we are still not 
sure as to what [the BOC orga
nizers] mean by cooperate  
they failed to define their 
agenda.... My concern for the 
future is what exactly each 
organization wants from 
this cooperation and is 
willing to extend to the 
other organizations.
Council votes on new president
IFC, from page 1
The term for an executive board of
ficer is one year. Six of the eight board 
positions were filled during the elec
tions, including Risk Manager Jason 
Altman, a junior economics major and 
a brother of Phi Kappa Theta, and 
Treasurer Kyoshi McGinnis, a sopho
more economics major and brother of 
Theta Xi. There were 14 members of 
the IFC that were eligible to vote in 
the elections.
Some members may react nega
tively to Avinashs election, but I be
lieve that they will come to realize 
Avis abilities. I dont believe that he 
would have been elected if the major
ity of the community didnt believe 
that he will serve his position well. 
Avis resignation was due to an iso
lated incident, and I dont feel that 
this past history it [sic] will become a 
problem, said Andrew Stovall, the 
newly elected secretary for IFC and a 
junior physics major.
The members of the InterFraternity
Council showed their confidence in 
Avi by electing him to his new posi
tion. If they had felt that his resigna
tion this past semester made him a 
poor choice, they would have voted 
differently, said Grant.
According to Grant, the IFCs purpose 
is to facilitate relationships with the 
administration, campus community, and 
other fraternities. Risk Management and 
negotiating the quads lease agreements 
are currently the organizations two 
main priorities.
Avi has plenty of experience with the 
InterFraternity Council and its inner 
workings, and performed an important 
role as Risk Manager until just recently. 
I am sure he will do an excellent job as 
IFC President, and continue to improve 
our internal relations and our relation
ship with the University, said Grant.
I hope to educate non-Greek students 
about the many benefits of joining a 
fraternity so that we can eliminate the 
harmful stereotypes that have prevented 
them from joining. I also hope to bring
fraternities closer to the rest of the cam
pus community and to the Administra
tion so that Carnegie Mellon will be 
a become an even better university 
to be a student, said Jain. 
Grant recognizes various improvements 
that have occurred during his term as 
President, including an improved rela
tionship with administration and Stu
dent Senate and progress in the hous
ing lease negotiations. Risk is down 
and the number of incidents of violation 
of our social policy is also down. And 
relations within the fraternal commu
nity are as well as can be expected, 
said Grant.
I felt that I understood both the needs 
of the Greek system as well asthe needs 
of the campus community. I think that 
both the Greek system and the rest of 
the student body can work together in 
such a way that everyone will enjoy life 
more at Carnegie Mellon, he said.
Jain, along with the other newly 
elected board members, will officially 
assume their roles next semester.
Life without Andrew...Fire in Cyert knocks out Andrew server
FIRE, from page 1
In order to activate the fire sup
pression system in the machine room, 
at least two ceiling sensors must de
tect a change in heat. When this hap
pens, the power is automatically shut 
off and the pipes of the sprinklers, 
normally empty, begin to fill with 
water. In this case, the pipes filled 
with water but not enough heat was 
detected to activate the sprinklers. 
Before power could be restored, it was 
necessary to get the water out of the 
pipes, Bartell said.
That was the odd thing.... In order to 
get the power back on, we needed 
plumbers, said Alex Hills, vice provost 
and chief information officer of Com
puting Services. Power was restored in 
Cyert by noon on Tuesday and the 
network was running by 2 pm, though
a few students accounts continued to - - 
be inaccessible even after the network ' . 
was restored. This was due to disk ' 1 
problems on one of the file servers 
which were repaired later in the day.  . 
No information was lost and a full 
back-up of student accounts was not 
necessary, according to Bartell.
In terms of the recovery, it was  
actually very quick, said Bartell. ^
The good news from our point of. 
view is that all the [fire suppression] " 
systems worked well, said Hills, V 
though he noted it was an irony that 
the result of the system working per- ^ 
fectly was the temporary breakdown 1 
of the network.
The difficulty students had with , 
online registration last Wednesday is  
probably unrelated to the fire, Bartell "j 
and Hills said.

11/16 VIOLATION OF LI
QUOR LAWS, 4:30 am  Offic
ers heard two females arguing 
while they were at the entrance 
to the Morewood parking lot. The 
went up to the area and the fe
males entered a nearby red Geo 
Storm. One of the officers tapped 
on the window, and the woman 
in the drivers seat opened the 
door. The officers immediately 
noticed the strong smell of alco
hol. The woman produced her 
CMU ID upon request. Her 
speech was slurred, and her eyes 
were red. He asked her if every
thing was okay. She said that 
she and her friend were arguing 
about their roommates. Because 
of the odor, the officer asked if 
she was 21. She s aid that she was
18. He explained to her the liquor 
laws of the state of Pennsylvania 
and issued her a non-traffic cita
tion for underage drinking.
11/17 MEDICAL,8:25 am  
Officers were dispatched to 
Baker Hall for a person with a cut 
forehead. Upon arrival they found 
the injured male with paper tow
els applied to his head to control 
the bleeding from a one-inch lac
eration. He told the officers that 
he cut his forehead when he at
tempted to jump down the three 
steps that are outside of Baker 
Hall 455A. The beam, which is a 
permanent fixture, is approxi
mately six feet directly above the 
steps. Several occupants of the 
area told us that there have been
numerous near misses with the 
beam. The student was trans
ported to the hospital, and CPS 
was contacted to have the blood 
on the carpet cleaned up.
11/17 THEFT,5:00 pm  An 
officer went to the Pretzel Works 
in the University Center for a 
theft report. Upon arriving he 
spoke with the Dining Gallery stu
dent manager.
He said that 1 1/2 racks of raw 
pretzel dough had been removed 
from a cooler. The cooler had been 
locked when it was left Saturday 
night and was locked when the 
dough was found missing. The 
dough was approximately worth 
$50. The officer could find no signs 
of forced entry.
11/20 SUSPICIOUS PACK
AGE, 9:10 am  The complain
ant phoned Campus Police to re
port a suspicious package that 
was on the floor near the post 
office on the third floor of Mellon 
Institute. Two officers responded 
to the call. Upon arrival they 
found a packaged object wrapped 
in plastic tape. The object was 
removed from the building and 
placed on the sidewalk on 
Dithridge Street. The package 
was then inspected and opened. 
It was then determined that the 
object was not a bomb, but in fact 
a Thermos jug wrapped in 
plastic for extra insulation. 
The Thermos was taken back to 
the Campus Police office where it

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  24 November 1997
Frats, officials plan 
housing renovations
HOUSING, from page 1
strain the fraternities existing debt to 
the University.
Our ideal solution to the problem would 
be for the University to take responsibil
ity for the cost of the new renovations, 
said Charles Anthe, former IFC House 
Manager and a junior electrical and com
puter engineering major. A larger rea
son for the high cost [of repairs] is based 
on the inadequacies of fraternity mainte
nance on the part of Housing in the 80s. 
Now they want to make up for it.
Fraternity housing costs rose in the 
last few years in order to pay off a $3 
million debt the fraternities incurred 
during multi-million dollar renovations 
of the quad in the early 1990s. Thats 
why we are having financial problems 
now  because housing decided to raise 
their standards and charged us for it, 
said Anthe. But the level of interest from 
[the University Housing Office] is at a 
very high level. Its where we want them 
to be.
As it stands, IFC fears current budgets 
are already under stress due to a combi
nation of high housing costs and low 
membership rates. Adding the cost of 
new renovations might put the fraterni
ties deeper in debt than they would be 
able to handle, said Anthe.
Paying current maintenance costs isnt 
a problem, he said. Its the cost of past 
debt. Fifty percent of rent goes towards 
paying the debt.
In order to prevent further damage to 
the fraternities financial situation, the 
Fraternity Quad Planning Committee 
suggested either retiring the existing 
debt before initiating new renovations 
Or refinancing the cost of the new reno
vations into the previous debt.
I dont think we can handle a new debt
until the old one is retired, said Anthe.
Each fraternity is allotted a capital 
reserve of $2,000 by the University 
per semester for special projects. By 
putting this money towards the most 
pressing maintenance needs, IFC can 
cut the increase in the new debt to 
incur from the renovations. The main 
question is when should maintenance 
renovations start and when will the 
loan be paid off, said Siegendorf.
While the University might hold off 
on long-term renovations to the quad 
certain repairs will be addressed im
mediately, such as installation of a 
new electrical system and the replace
ment of all heat systems. AME speci
fied that some repairs need to happen 
immediately, said Anthe.
Possible plans for long-term restruc
turing of the fraternity quad include 
rebuilding smaller houses to reduce 
upkeep costs. Right now the average 
occupancy [of a fraternity house] is 29, 
and full occupancy is 36 to 39 people 
per house, said Siegendorf. That 
equals roughly $24,000 that a frater
nity has to pay for by increasing rent 
or dues per member.
People will only pay so much before 
they decide its not worth it, he added.
Both Siegendorf and Anthe said that 
fraternities are taking measures to 
increase Rush numbers for next fall. 
Its our responsibility to have a good 
rush, said Siegendorf.
One of the most attractive things 
about joining a fraternity is the low 
cost of.housing and right now we cant 
provide that, said Anthe. How can 
you get new members when you cant 
offer financial incentives? It deter
mines whether or not you have an 
active organization or not.

Masters student passes away
By MICHELLE HAN
Tartan Staffwriter
Shinro Nagano, a second-year mas
ters student at GSIA, died Sunday, No
vember 9 of natural causes at his home 
in Pittsburgh. He was 31.
Nagano died of a pulmonary embuli, a 
blood clot in the lung which displays no 
visible outward signs of illness.
He had class on Friday, said 
Manjula Shyam, director of the inter
national program at GSIA. His friends 
saw him and talked to him on Satur
day. Of course it was a big shock to 
everybody, especially his family. It 
was completely unexpected, although 
he did die of natural causes.
I guess we all feel sort of helpless, 
said Shyam.
After studying at Japans prestigious 
Hitotsubashi University in Tokyo, 
Nagano began his career at the Bank 
of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, where he was 
promoted to manager in 1994. In 1996 
he began his studies at GSIA as a 
sponsored student and intended to 
earn his masters degree in finance 
and international business.
We believed that after graduation 
he would be very successful, said 
Shintaro Yonemoto, a close friend and 
second-year masters student at GSIA. 
He [would have] become a board mem
ber in that bank.
He worked very hard, said Masaki 
Yonemoto, Shintaro Yonemotos wife 
and also a second-year masters student 
at GSIA. Only a few people get to be 
sponsored [to study here]. He had to 
compete against maybe 700 others  
its very difficult.
Naganos wife, Yasuyo, and two chil
dren  a daughter Yoko, three and a half 
years old, and a son Soto, eleven months
 returned to Japan last week. I think 
thats the thing that breaks peoples hearts 
the most, Shyam said. He wont be able 
to see his kids grow.
His goal was to become successful in 
where he worked, Yonemoto said. But I 
think his biggest goal was to stay with his

his masters degree i n business.
family and raise his children well.
Mr. Yonemoto said one of his most 
memorable experiences with Nagano 
took place during a trip to Salzburg with 
the Nagano family. Usually he doesnt 
talk very much. But one night during 
that trip I visited his room. We drank a 
lot of wine and talked a lot about how he 
wanted to raise his children, [about] 
how he was raised and what he wanted 
to do in his life.
He said one time when he was little 
[he and his brother and sister] were sent 
to summer camp in Switzerland. They 
felt very lonely, but they learned how 
brothers and sisters should help each 
other. He wanted that same thing for his 
kids, said Yonemoto.
Yonemoto remembers a time in class 
when Nagano was talking about creat
ing competitive careers. A student 
raised his hand and said, So Shinro, if a 
good job somewhere far away were to 
come along would you take it? And 
Shinro immediately said No, I have a 
family to consider. I think that says [a 
lot] about the kind of man he was.
A memorial service which was held 
for Nagano on Wednesday the Novem
ber 12 was well attended. So many 
people came, said Shyam. It must 
have been really gratifying for the fam
ily. Over 150 people came to give their 
condolences. The dean was there, many 
professors, staff, all of his friends, and 
so many students.
This event was very sad, but what was 
good about it was how the GSIA commu
nity responded, he said.
Everyone wanted to help the family, 
Yonemoto said. They cooked three meals 
a day, they did the moving sale, they sold 
the car. GSIAis very busy, but wejust took 
the whole week off to help.
Yonemoto said he and his wife are 
working towards building a scholarship 
fund for the Nagano children. Shyam 
worked on a photo album with Naganos 
friends to give to the Nagano family.
[Im doing it] so when his children 
grow up, when they learn how to read 
they would have memories of their fa
ther, said Shyam. They have a chance 
to know what their father meant.
Students approve Activities Fee increase

into a student hangout.
I would think that in the short run 
[funding] would go more towards current 
organizations, but thats nothing set in 
stone, said EamonKeleher, Funding and 
Recognition (F&R) chair and a junior me
chanical engineering major.
I think a lot of student organizations 
[who receive Activities Fee funding] have 
been feeling sort of a noose around their 
neck, saidToraason. This [increase] will 
allow them to have quality programs where 
the dollar sign isnt the most important 
thing. The funding will be there for them. 
Obviously we have to ease the suffering
of current organizations ... but Id like to 
see more large projects too, said Matt 
Phelps, student body vice president and a 
junior electrical and computer engineer
ing major. During the information ses
sions, many organizational leaders stated 
they would like to see more large, studentrun projects and events as well.

FORUM
Carnegie Mellon University24 November 1997AB deserves praise for event planning
: It seems that a common ques
tion at CMU is what should I do 
for fun tonight ? This past semes
ter, the Activities Board has con
tinually provided answers to that 
question, bringing to campus en
tertaining bands, speakers, and 
films  and students have apjplauded their efforts by attend
ing in packs. While a number of 
other student organizations are 
paving financial problems, AB 
has managed to use their funds 
jtp their maximum potential, mak
ing campus events a viable source 
jojf entertainment and relaxation.
 In the last month, AB has 
brought three big-name enter
tainers to CMU, packing in 
crowds of students, leaving only 
standing room for those trickling 
in at the last minute. While ce
lebrities such as Andy Richter, 
Henry Rollins, and They Might 
Be Giants are known to draw 
'large turn-out rates, ABs excel
lent publicity efforts should also 
;be credited. Students didnt at
tend these events as an after
thought  they knew well in 
advance when and where they 
were to occur. And they were ex
cited. Such events foster school 
spirit since they make it easy for 
students to socialize together 
around a common interest.
; The AB-sponsored Sunday 
'.night films series are another big 
attraction at CMU. The selection 
df movies shown on campus since 
;late August prove that AB orgainizers are paying attention to 
what students want to see. This
semester, the Sunday film series 
has received its highest turn-out 
rates in recent history. Since AB 
now offers a variety of films that 
all students can enj oy rather than 
just exclusive cult flicks, B-movies, and gore-fests, students of
ten plan their weekends around 
AB showings.
AB also hosted a social during 
the showing of Swingers, that 
drew in 800 students. AB Coffee
house concerts has brought 
smaller bands to campus on a 
regular basis. AB Political Speak
ers sponsored lectures during In
ternational Festival and for Do 
Something Day, with a full sched
ule of events planned for next 
semester, from Black History 
Month lectures to a discussion on 
gay marriages.
Student organizations are most 
effective, not when they act as 
separate entities, but when they 
collaborate with other groups. AB 
has used its monies to support 
other organizations endeavors by 
co-sponsoring events such as 
WRCTs Tainted Candy benefit 
show. Next semesterthey hope to 
work with the Student Dormi
tory Council to bring a major 
label band to perform at a time 
other than Carnival.
While this set of AB organizers' 
have gone above and beyond their 
previous efforts, they should make 
sure that their enthusiasm and 
dedication extends beyond their 
term. If they can do that, AB will 
continue to be one of the most 
successful groups on campus.FCEs should be administered properly

nent in making tenure decisions 
in addition to improvements to 
teaching practices and course 
structure. Professors should fa
cilitate student feedback to the 
best of their ability because it is 
to their benefit to receive helpful 
commentary. The University 
should make it clear to students 
that the evaluations profit both 
faculty and students  without" 
this sort of communication, the 
quality of education CMU stu
dents receive would not remain 
up to par with its standards.
Once students turn in their com
pleted FCE, they often wonder 
what the ramifications oftheir com
ments actually are since they gen
erally do not know that the results 
are available to everyone. While 
the University publishes the re
sults each semester, the informa
tion is so poorly circulated that the 
effort is futile in benefiting stu
dents. Most students dont know 
that a book listing the results can 
usually be found in Hunt Library. 
They dont know that they can use 
this resource when deciding which 
classes to take, or that their com
ments can tangibly affect the way 
classes are taught at CMU.
It is important to remember 
that the caliber of the University 
is often judged by student opin
ion. If FCEs are to be a successful 
outlet for measure student satis
faction, then both faculty and the 
administration should treat the 
process as an important part of 
course planning.
My mother always told me that eat
ing too many hot dogs could be bad for 
you. That combination of fat and whoknows-what animal by products couldnt 
possibly be healthy.
Yet even she couldnt imagine the dam
age and devastation one little hot dog 
could wreak. Instead of clogging arter
ies, this frankfurter clogged entire com
puter systems. Instead of being served 
with a side of fries, it was frying servers.
Dont let that wholesome facade fool 
you, and dont be distracted by the warm 
and fuzzy memories of all those barbe
cues you shared with his frankfurter 
brethren  this tot dog killed Andrew. 
This hot dog brought CMU to a screech
ing halt.
This wicked, bad-smelling cylin
der of over-processed luncheon meat 
temporarily destroyed that which is 
more valuable to any self-respect
ing CMU student than life itself  
free Internet access.
The repercussions of this loss spread 
over campus in less than the time it 
takes for, say, the smoke from a burnt 
hot dog to set off a fire alarm.
A plan to storm Hebrew National head
quarters in a frenzy of vengeance had to
be cancelled when students realized that, 
without being able to email each other, 
they couldnt organize such an event.
No longer able to hear Netscapes si
ren song of procrastination, they were 
forced to explore old-fashioned ways of 
not doing their work.
In spite of all the work it took to bring 
registration online, students staring at 
blank screens for hours on end began to 
consider whether traipsing from build
ing to building, RAD form in hand, might 
not be faster after all.
Shocked, nearly prostrate with grief, 
students realized they would actually 
have to talk to each other.
Since they couldnt share their grief 
electronically, they had no choice but to 
make actual physical contact.
It was really heartwarming to watch 
the poor students, mainly used to seeing 
each other in the harsh glow of Wean or 
Margaret Morrison clusters, stumbling 
towards each other in this strange natu
ral light.
All over campus on Tuesday after
noon, students sat together, consol
ing each other in their time of need. 
Well, almost all over campus. Very 
few people could bear to go to The 
0  no doubt, that familiar greasy 
smell would bring on another round 
of tears and mourning.
The hot dog incident plunged the cam
pus into a deeper state of shock than 
weve experienced since the Wean fire. 
Hmmm ... pretty interesting, isnt it?
Twice in the space of a month, fire alarms 
have pulled students away from their 
computers and into a world where the 
only mice around are in their dorms 
nibbling on their leftover cheese and 
where menus offer you a selection < 
foods, not file commands.
I strongly suspect an H&SS conspiracy. 
Impatient with the amount of time the 
rest of the campus spends online, a radi
cal, pyromaniacal, and computer-illiter
ate coterie of humanities majors prob
ably decided to take matters into their 
own hands.
I hesitate to think about what they 
might do for an encore.
Who knows, if they continue their 
plotting, we might end up with more 
computer-free time than we know what 
to do with.
Well have no choice but to fill some 
of this time with planning social 
gatherings. Im thinking lots and lots 
of barbecues.

Justin Cina
Picture a really sopping wet 
cloth. At this point, the only 
objective is to get it dry. So it 
has to be wrung out. As it 
starts to twist, a little liquid 
comes out. As the twisting 
gets tighter, more liquid gets 
squeezed out.
Soon, every drop of liquid 
has been extracted. Its dried 
out and twisted up, wrinkled 
and stretched. There simply 
isnt any more liquid that 
could be taken from it. No 
matter what amount of twist
ing and contorting one ap
plies to it, it will not yield 
anything. This seems to be a 
general feeling amongst the 
CMU student body, weve sim
ply been wrung out.
The semester has taken its 
toll. In every major, the stu
dents talents and creative 
capacities have been 
stretched, their intellectual 
capabilities exhausted.
In the beginning of the year, 
we were all running on a full 
tank. We soon got involved in 
our studies and our various 
activities on campus. We were 
excited and challenged by the 
curriculum, and met or ex
ceeded the demands of our 
professors. Drip.
Our involvement became 
more intense as time passed.
It was no longer the frivo
lous excitement that we ex
perienced in the first few 
days of school.
Midterms passed by, test
ing the level of our studies 
and involvement. We were

all have to face the facts. But 
our energy and resources have 
been used up. We never had 
time to stop and fill up the 
tank. Basically, were runnin 
on fumes.
We can try to give it all 
weve got, but it seems that 
whatever that is, its only a 
fraction of our original supply. Weve been wrung out. 
Were pretty much dry, yet 
they are still wringing.
For the masochists, this is a 
pleasurable state; for the rest 
of us, lets just say its not. For 
all of us, though, this is where, 
the light at the end of the tun
nel comes.
Vacation, a time to relax and 
revive. This means the semes
ter is done.
This is not a pseudo-vaca
tion where homework is

This is the big kahuna with no 
strings attached. Just think

warm fuzzies.
So let us all rejoice. Weve 
worked pretty darn hard, and 
were still pushing (give your
self a pat on the back). No mat
ter how we react, were always 
going to be wrung out by tl|e 
end of the semester. Most likel)' 
this is for the better (builds 
character, says Dad).
But, even if we dont consider 
this all to be worthwhile,  
the demands of CMU remaiji 
too much, we always have oiir

a good one, with plenty of tinie

Clinton corruption goes beyond grave
/ Jamas Gtena,James Stepanek
; Just when you think the Clinton 
administration can sink no fur
ther, they end up surprising 
; even me. Just this week news 
! broke that Clinton, not stop ping his disrespect for the mili, tary with the current soldiers, 
I has been cheapening the 
; memory of dead veterans.
The current administration has 
'been basically selling spots in 
; Arlington National Cemetery.
; It seems that Bubba and com
pany have been granting waivers 
vto non-veterans to be buried in 
! the cemetery in a quid pro quo for 
large donations to the DNC 
(Democratic National Conven! tion). Spots in Arlington National 
| Cemetery are usually reserved 
for veterans who have been highly 
decorated during service in for
eign wars.
This administration has al
ready granted 60 waivers for 
" burial in national cemeteries, 
which is a record number, much 
higher than the 10 to 15 which
have occurred in prior adminis
trations. Waivers are usually 
granted for spouses of veterans 
who are already buried in the 
cemetery, or for people who have 
contributed to the nation in a 
substantial way. (Mind you, this 
means the nation, not the Demo
cratic party.)
Most of the waivers granted 
have been found to be spouses 
and such, but a fair number have 
been revealed to not fit in the 
normal waiver categories, and 
the administration refuses to let 
out the names.
Only one person granted a 
waiver has been revealedLarry 
Lawrence, a California hotel 
owner who was not a veteran, 
but a major donor to the DNC. 
Since this story was released by 
Insight Magazine, and followed 
up by Investors Business Daily, 
the administration has been in 
major spin control mode.
Excuses, denials, and obfusca
tions are dropping out of the 
White House like carpet bomb
ing. However, I dont know if it 
will be enough. Many of the 
Clinton scandals have been subtle 
corruption in which only unnoticed laws were broken. This is a of a PC orthodoxy would like,

set of core values. This has been 
a deep appreciation for personal 
liberty and responsibility.
James Stepanek is a PhD can
didate in materials science engineering. Since hes graduat
ing this semester, he has some 
last thoughts to share:
Ifyou forget most everything 
I have ever written, I just want 
you to remember that those lib
erties which you have should 
be guarded more jealously 
than anything else in your life. 
Id like to end this with the 
best quote from any of my col
umns as something for you to 
think about....
Of course people nowadays 
actually have the gall to claim 
that rights are granted by the 
government. They say the Bill of 
Rights gives you these rights. 
This is absolutely wrong. The 
government grants no rights. 
The Bill of Rights recognizes 
rights which are assumed to be 
inviolate, and proscribes the 
government from infringing 
these rights. These rights are 
yours, given the presence of the 
government or not. These are 
the natural rights of which John 
Locke spoke. Religious people 
will claim these are God-given 
rights. Being an atheist myself, 
I say they are rights inherent in 
being a human being.
Connecting with new people lifts spirits
Jeff Thibert
Its been quite the semester, hasnt it? 
Well, it has for me anyway. Ive had my 
share of experiences, my good times and 
bad times, and Ive been trying to figure 
out what exactly has distinguished the 
happy times from those times when things 
werent so great, and the answer is pretty 
clear  people.
It seems as if people have determined 
my happiness; but this might make it 
sound as if they have told me when I could 
be happy and when I could not. So per
haps it would be better to say that my 
interactions with people have determined 
my happiness.
Essentially, when Ive had good, mean
ingful interactions with people, my hap
piness has peaked, and when Ive had 
negative, painful interactions with people, 
my happiness has been at its lowest.
Finally, when I havent interacted with 
people at all, Ive been sort of neutral  
not really sad or upset, but not particu
larly happy, either  more content than 
anything else.
Realizing this has caused me to have a 
few regrets about this past semester.
If I find that Im happiest when I have 
meaningful interactions with people, then 
why didnt I look for that sort of thing all 
of the time, so I could be happiest all of 
the time?
I really have to wonder why I didnt try 
to have more meaningful interactions with 
people this past semester.
I have to wonder why I didnt go up to 
people I didnt know and try to start con
versations about, well, anything. I have 
to wonder why I didnt take advantage 
of the people that surround me (almost 
constantly) in Mudge, and try to get to 
know them a little better.lt seems as if I 
blew so many perfect opportunities
through which I could have become a 
lot happier.
Why would I do such a thing? Well, if 
you did it too, then you probably al
ready know why. I dont have the guts 
to strike up random conversations with 
random people.
Theyll probably think Im weird, and 
I care what people think about me.
Or maybe its because theres just 
always too much work to do, and just
Too much work? Not a good reason, 
either. Take breaks.
If we work all the time, we may get 
good QPAs, but oftentimes, you can 
learn far more interesting things from 
other people than you can from books, 
or drawing, or coding, or building, or 
dancing, or singing, or writing, or.... 
And if I just cant bear to tear myself 
away from the work, maybe I can 
incorporate other people into my work
People understand far more than we think 
 were all more alike than we realize, and 
we all think about the same basic things 
more often than we might guess. 
not enough time to hang out with people 
and waste time.
Or might it be that I dont think I like 
these people?
Or that Im too different?
Or finally, maybe its because I think 
theyre not deep enough, and hence 
wont really understand (or take seri
ously) the questions that I ask of them.
Of course, if you didnt make the same 
mistake I (and probably some others) 
did, and did take advantage of the 
people around you, and did have the 
guts to strike up conversations with 
random people around campus, more 
power to you.
And less power to those of us who 
dont start conversations and dont en
joy peoples company often enough, be
cause any reason that I have presented 
for not wanting to talk to people can 
easily be shot down.
Not having the courage to talk to 
people is dumb  sure, some people are 
probably going to think Im a bit weird 
for initiating random conversations, but 
the number of interesting people Ill 
meet is sure to far outweigh the num
ber of people Ill alienate.
 find some people in my class and 
work on the homework together: The 
best of both worlds. Not liking the 
people and feeling that Im too differ
ent are bad reasons, also.
Its hard to believe that I could not 
like any of the people I know (and, in 
fact, I really do like quite a few of the 
people I know); and its also rather 
difficult to believe that everyone I 
know is different from me  or at 
least that everyone is too different to 
allow for any sort of connection.
But even if I really dont like any
one, and I really am different, then 
thats all the more reason to try ran
dom conversations  Im bound to 
meet someone like me that I like.
There was a final reason, though  
that people arent deep enough to 
understand me.
This is insane; I think that every
one (or almost everyone, arguments 
often fall apart on absolutes) here 
could be deep, or could understand 
me perfectly, if he or she wanted to.
If I ever feel like they wouldnt 
get me, its just because I dont know 
them very well, or because I havent
tried very hard. People understand far 
more than we think  were all more 
alike than we realize, and we all think 
about the same basic things more often 
than we might guess.
So, if Im so sure that people wouldnt 
understand me, I should test my little 
theory, and try initiating deep con
versations with others  ultimately, 
theres nothing to lose.
And this is basically what Im trying 
to say  that theres nothing to lose by 
talking to lots of different people.
The variety of people is probably the 
greatest part of the college experience, 
and were throwing away so much if we 
dont get to know at least some of these 
people  sure, maybe we wont jive 
with them all, but who cares?
Itll be worth it just for the ones with 
whom we do click.
For those of you already doing this, 
keep it up! And try to talk to lots of 
different sorts of people.
You might get along incredibly well 
with the people that seem to be most 
directly your opposite, and you just 
might be able to persuade the more 
timid people out of their shells, giving 
them the confidence to go talk to people 
who might then, in turn, gain confi
dence and go talk to other people  
you could have quite the effect.
This is something I will strive to do 
as I enter my second semester of col
lege, and this is something for which 
we all should strive, because people 
are at the center of most of our happi
ness and enrichment.
The more people we can come to know, 
the happier we will be, the less alone 
we will feel, and the more about life 
(and ourselves) we will learn.

College football should institute playoff season
The Pigskin Pundit
by Chris Cannon
American football. It has a certain 
ring to it. Football has always seemed to 
be a microcosm of America. Complete 
with violence, repressed sexuality, and 
built-in patriarchy. Ahh, America!
And whats more American than con
troversy? In a word, college football is 
controversy. Its the only major sport, 
college or pro, where the champion is 
determined by voting. Is that democracy 
or what?
Due to this policy, after every season, 
controversy ensues. In 1991, because 
the leading polls disagreed, there were 
co-champions: Colorado and Georgia
Tech. In 1994, Nebraska was crowned 
champ even though Penn State was 
also undefeated. Florida State won in 
1993 with one loss, even though 
a Notre Dame team that beat 
them also lost only once. Last 
year, Florida, one of many teams 
with a sole defeat, was voted in 
as the winner.
But there are some benefits to 
this system. Over 100,000 fans 
watch Tennesee's and Michigans 
and home games because a 
chance at the national champi
onship is on the line every game.
Peoples eyes stay glued to their 
TVs and scoreboards to see if the 
cross-state rival lost and by how 
much. With such attention, hype, 
and hoopla, it seems at least 
twice a year we have the game 
of the century.
Next year, things are sup
posed to get better when the 
PAC 10 and Big 10 make their confer
ence champions available for the big 
Alliance Bowl. This would enable an 
undefeated top-ranked team from ei
ther conference like Michigan for in- No, the only way college football will

UCLA lost two close games to 
teams currently ranked in the top 
10. Since then the Bruins have 
been on a tear, winning nine 
straight. They scored 66 points 
both times they played in the state 
of Texas. Kansas State and North 
Carolina are both 10-1, but each 
has no shot at the championship. 
If the undefeated teams lose their 
bowl games, another one-loss team 
with a higher profile will win. 
Ohio State lost away games to two 
teams in the top five by four points 
each. Whos to say that these 
teams couldnt win a playoff?
However, the arguments against a 
playoff are sound and simple. The bowl

Boycott threats make stars look unprofessional
On Net
: by Jessica StrelitzgiijiiiiiiwiiimiiiuiiimiiiiMuiinMMas
Xiike the Olympics werent bi
zarre enough already, this past 
week has been hell for hockey 
fahs the world over. First, a whole 
biinch of Russians say that they 
nt want to play because they 
dont like the way the last inter
national competition was held 
(the World Cup, which the Ameri
can team won in 1996). Then this 
bizarre rumor comes out that 
Biett Hull  who was bom in 
Canada but holds dual citizen
ship and plays for the US  will 
bljycottthe Games unless the Devi ils Bill Guerin is put on the ros
ter. WHAT?
i-This is the perfect example of 
1 the things that are wrong with
putting professional athletes in 
the gamesthey bring with them 
their big professional hang-ups. 
The Russians: Coyotes goalie 
Nikolai Khabibulin, Red Wings 
Slava Kozlov, Slava Fetisov, Igor 
Larianov, and Chicagos Alexi 
Zhamnov have just said no to 
playing in Nagano.
Their beef is that they hated 
the World Cup. They hated the 
Russian Hockey Federations ap
pointed coaches, the style they 
were forced to play, and the way 
the Federation treated them. It is 
all very ambiguous. Larianov said 
that he wasnt playing because he 
wanted to give the younger guys a 
chance. Noble, but if youre asked 
to play, you play. End of story.
Gary Bettman, commissioner 
of the NHL, is freaking out and 
saying that if this experiment 
of Dream Teams in the Olympics 
doesnt work smoothly, hell never 
let them do it again. But that still 
leaves holes on the Russian ros
ter and the probability that 
their performance will weaken 
in the Games.
I hope Bettman sticks to his 
guns and cancels the whole thing 
after 1998. Its too hokey and dis
rupting. The Olympic prepara
tion is creating waves throughout 
the NHL. The season was tight
ened up to allow for the two week 
lull in February to play the OlymJames Mojonnler/Tartan Art Co-Editor 
pic games. So teams play two and 
three games back to back, increas
ing injuries and the maddening 
dullness ofthe game. Some ofthese 
teams look dead on their skates.
The U.S. team is a whole other 
thing. First, the rosters came out. 
The expected guys made the team,
but there are still six spots open on 
the roster. Then Blues winger Brett 
Hull tells the Toronto Star that he 
wants Bill Guerin to be put on the 
roster or hell boycott the games. 
Guerin is one of the leagues best 
young power forwards and had 
been a contract hold-out with the 
Devils. The Devils GM is Lou 
Lamoriello, who is also GM of the 
Olympic squad and a direct hand 
in choosing the team.
Hull suspected that Lamoriello 
was holding the contract dispute 
over Guerins head. Lamoriello 
said that he didnt choose Guerin 
because Guerin was out of shape. 
In any case, who died and made 
Brett Hull the guy who picks the 
team? Last time I looked he was 
just a player. When you give some
one too much say and power, they 
abuse it and it disrupts the fun of 
this spirited competition.
The next day, Hull said that he 
was misquoted by The Star and 
that he was only supporting U.S. 
captain Brian Leech, who has 
stood up for Guerin publicly. If 
Guerin wants more than his of
fered $3 million, 5-year deal then; 
fine, thats OK with Hull. He stilE 
wants him to play  but he also, 
wants some Olympic gold.
I know why they want Guerin^ 
he did very play really well in the" 
World Cup. But there are other 
players, like Pat Lafontaine, who 
are also looking for bids on the 
team. And with all of the guys hold
ing out right now, it's their own: 
damnedfault. Its not like they arent 
beingallowedto play hockey. I ques
tion allowing hold-outs to play on', 
NHL stocked squads. If they are1 
going to have NHLers, they have*, 
NHLers who are active.
But the story isnt over. On 
Friday, they announced Guerins 
signing to an undisclosed amount.  
Maybe the controversy did swing' 
things in Guerins favor after all. 
And that is sad within itself.

Tartan men win in 
basketball opener
OPENER, from page 10
made some unforced turnovers, 
said Wingen. The team cut the margin 
l^four, trailing 47-31 at the break.
^It was a situation where we came 
: ojitwithalack offocus, saidBarbanell.
[We had] no organization on offense. 
We didnt start doing the things wed 
; practiced for the last month and a half.  
But in the second half, things turned 
round. Sofish made 4-6 3-pointers in 
the second half and finished with 20 
points. Mills, Shaunessey, and senior 
LaDale Widemeyer led a defensive shut
down with two steals each. And starting 
center Bowersox filled the middle.
Its definitely different, Bowersox 
said of starting. Last year I was com
ing off the bench, so theres definitely 
the added pressure. Bowersox had 16 
points, ten rebounds, and four blocks in 
the game, without commiting a foul. 
But the Tartans as a team were called 
for 25 personal fouls and Grove City 
le them pay. Grove City, which hit 
just 57 percent of their free-throws 
Friday against Allegheny, shot 29-30 
against CMU on Saturday.
With 20 seconds left, the Tartans 
I tied the game at 73, but fouled the 
! opponents point guard with 12 ticks 
left. After he hit both, Sofish missed a 
o-ahead three. Shaunessey rebounded 
and missed, but Barbanell tipped in 
[the miss at the buzzer.
:But after playing their second game in 
two nights and the 16-point comeback, 
the Tartans were flat in the overtime 
because of Exhaustion, Bowersox said. 
It took all our energy to come back and 
we were pretty drained in the overtime.
The overtime was all Grove City, 
said Wingen. GC took an early lead 
with a 3-pointer and never looked back, 
scoring all 15 points in the extra frame. 
You get down, six or eight points and 
you have to start fouling, said Wingen. 
It was definitely one of the strangest 
games that Ive been a part of. For us to 
play as poorly as we did in the first half, 
then play as well as we did in the second 
half, and then completely fall apart in 
overtime was very bizarre.
In the two games, CMU has shown 
improvement in problem areas from last 
year. It seemed wed lose for any num
ber of reasons last year, Bowersox said. 
Weve been hitting our free-throws. 
We outrebounded both of our oppo
nents, Wingen said. The Tartans shot 
69 and 76 percent and held a 43-42 and 
47-42 rebound edge against W&J and 
GC respectively.
CMUs strength this season should be 
our depth, said Bowersox. Eight play
ers saw at least 20 minutes of action 
Saturday. We just have a lot of good 
people. If we can find good combinations 
to work with, we should do well.
After finding themselves just short of 
a victory several times last season, the 
Tartans finished 9-16, including 4-10 
in the nine team UAA.
Chicago returns everybody, Wingen 
said of last years UAA champion. Seven 
teams in the conference had winning 
records last year. Itll be another real 
competitive year in the UAA, Im sure, 
said Wingen.
CMU plays Case Western Reserve 
University Tuesday at 8 pm.

SEMESTER, from page 10
LHU rallied in the second period, scoring 
three unanswered goals on starting ten
der Jon Khegman. Grzywacz finished the 
period by scoring from Leonhardt and 
CMU was ahead 5-3 going into the third.
Early in the third, Voulgaris and 
Grzywacz were scrambling in from of the 
LHU net and Voulgaris put the puck 
away. But LHU countered by scoring 
four more unanswered goals, creating 
the 7-6 advantage until Duncan, with a 
minute left in the game, scored from 
sophomore Brandon Paluzzi and 
Fitzgerald, to tie the game and end it 7- 
7. LHU outshot CMU 41-22, including 
18 shots in the final period.
After four hours on a crowded bus that
didnt get the Tartans home until 6 am 
Saturday, the team hit the ice hours 
later to face IUP II, their final home 
game of the semester. Carnegie Mellon 
played up against the IUP attack, but 
was down 3-0 after two periods of play. 
The team wasnt giving up though, and 
they played the third period with heart.
The game ended in the 3-0 loss. Start
ing goaltender Min had 23 saves, but 
CMU was outshot 26-21.
Im proud of the team. They have 
come a long way since the first practice. 
We have achieved a lot, even though we 
havent won a lot, said head coach Fred 
Maddalena. As Maddalena explained, 
after CMU graduated almost 90 percent 
of their scoring capacity, the players
have had to fill big holes and that is very j 
difficult. We can keep up with everyone J 
in the division, and I think that wej 
proved it tonight, he said.
The spring will bring the return of| 
grad student Roger Maddalena, and that. 
will change the lines a bit. The team is! 
hoping that some other players who may; 
have been holding out for a semester ! 
will come out to join the Tartan ranks, j
The spirit of the game, is not a record; 
that says 2-6-1; but one where the play- j 
ers and coaches are proud of their perfor-} 
mance no matter what. This team hasj 
come a long way and they know it, butj 
their pride is hurt. They will think about; 
it for the next two months and come back j 
in January ready to play the game. jAll-Americans run at nationals

was expressed by several other runners.
The teams that proved to be the big
gest challenges for the CMU teamthe 
College of New Jersey and Moravian 
College  successfully achieved the top 
ten with fifth and eighth place finishes, 
respectively. We really shouldve been 
right next to Moravian, said Donatelli.
Next year things could be closer, as the 
team will hold onto most of its runners. 
Senior Melissa Lott is graduating. Shes 
a very good runner and were going to 
miss her a lot, said sophomore Melissa 
Sloan. Sloan placed 144th this weekend.
With the loss of Melissa Lott, Donatelli 
is looking forward to the team benefitting 
from the skills and abilities of some of his 
eighth and ninth place runners. The fact
that team has a strong contingent ofj 
younger runners gives them an equal; 
shot at next year, maybe even a better; 
shot. I feel it was a tremendous success,;

Freshman Julie Tseng set a pool record 
for the freestyle at 1:59.57 and came in 
second in the 100 freestyle. Shes displayed 
some excellent swims, said Belowich.
We got some really strong freshman
women in. They made us a lot stronger. 
Were more motivated and closer, I 
think, said junior Jen Scully.
Our showing against Emory proves 
that we have very strong swimmers, 
said Schmelzer.
Some members of the team may com

The entire team is gearing up for a two-;

four to five hours in training each day.j

Throughout the entire second

the game with seven field goals.

with thirty sec onds remaining, 
W&L put in another field goal

not enough, and the Tartans lost 
the game 55-56.
Majernik said, The ref kind of

called some pretty poor fouls on 
us. Of W&Ls 56 points, 24 were 
from foul shots. Neuman said, 
Offensively, they really pen

basically drew a lot of fouls on 
their drives.
In both games, the Tartans kept 
the game moving at a frantic pace, 
constantly substituting players 
to keep the squad fresh. This 
year, were trying to go with a 
more fast-paced game... keep 
people fresh on the press, Steele 
said. Were really trying to es

said Majernik.
Thats what you have to do to 
win. That worked against Rose

Neuman said. Its really nice to

Its nice to not have to rely on one

Tartans tip-off 
hoops season
By PAUL BOOTHE
Tartan Personnel Manager
The final match of the CMU 
Tip-ofi'Tournament this week
end was a great disappointment 
for the womens basketball 
team. This loss came after the 
Tartans resounding defeat of 
Rose-Hulman on Friday. CMU 
never trailed Friday night. Af
ter Rose-Hulman matched their 
first bucket, the Tartans used a 
:full-court press to score the next 
10 points in five minutes to 
force the opponents into a 
timeout. CMUs lead never 
dipped under double-digits as 
they raced to a 57-38 win.
I was real happy with the 
way we ran the ball, said se
nior guard Marcelle Steele.
We were able to get a run
ning game going against them, 
said sophomore forward 
Samantha Majernik. That 
shook them up, and they didnt 
know how to stop us. CMU 
kept the substitutions coming 
to keep fresh players in the 
game and the pressure onRoseiHulman. I think our freshmen 
really helped us that game, 
said Majernik.
But Sunday, after outplaying 
opponent Washington & Lee 
up and down the court, the Tar
tans let the game get away from 
them in the final minutes to 
end up on the losing end of a 
56-55 score.
The first half of the game 
foretold problems that would 
later prove to be the Tartans 
downfall. CMU played the W&L 
team ragged, putting away nine 
field goals to W&Ls three. How
ever, at the end of the half, the 
Generals remained close on the 
Tartans heels as CMU gave 
away point, after point at the 
free-throw line. In the last 
five minutes of the first half, 
W&L collected 11 unanswered 
points in free-throws to come 
back from a 21-7 deficit to 
end the half 21-18. They beat 
us on the free-throw line, said 
Steele. When we got on the 
foul line, we werent converting 
like they were.

This meet, as close as it was, was 
a real team effort. I couldnt ask for 
anything better, said David 
Belowich, head coach of the CMU 
swim team.
The swim team finished the first 
half of their season with a great 
performance against Case West
ern Reserve University and Emory 
University last Saturday. The mens 
team holds a 4-2 record after beat
ing both Case Western and Emory. 
The women won against Case West
ern and lost to Emory by a small 
margin for an overall 3-3 record.
It came down to the last relay. 
We went for first and third and we 
won first and second. We won 
the meet by the depth of the team. 
You cant just win the meet with 
eight good people. You need 
the whole team, said freshman 
Jon Alpert.
The men were behind 95-112 
early in the meet. Three freshman 
men pulled together and scored 
major points during the breast
stroke event, changing the score to 
109-117. Jason Striner broke 
the pool record, winning the 
event. Nathan Palm came in third 
place and Andrew Gardner came 
in fifth. They all went really fast, 
said Belowich.
Everyone gathered up by the 
pool to cheer them on, said Alpert.
The men were looking better but 
still behind after the breaststroke. 
It all came down to the relay, where 
the swimmers pulled together to

CMU kicked off the season with a win 
'and then an exciting loss in mens bas
ketball. After taking a nine-point halftime lead, the Tartans cruised to a win 
over Washington & Jefferson at Grove 
-City Friday night.
We came out confident in our offense 
and things clicked, junior center Dan 
Bowersox said. Junior guard Scott 
Mills led the way with 22 points on 9-12 
shooting. Junior guard Tommy Praesel 
and Bowersox added 16 and 13 points 
respectively and nine rebounds. Bowersox 
also had five blocks. Senior Colin Shaunessy 
scored nine point and ledtheteamwithfour 
assits off the bench.
The opener also marked the collegiate 
debut for Geoff Barbanell, the teams only 
freshman. Barbanell is a 6'6" small for
ward, but plays Whatever Coach needs.
One big thing is the close-knit team, 
said Barbanell. Its great to just have
the opportunity to play good teams night 
in and night out.
It was a nice crowd, said Barbanell, 
who had five points in eight 
minutes. Surprisingly, I wasnt as 
nervous as I thought Id be. It was 
pretty exhilarating.
We pretty much controlled the whole 
game, Wingen said. Defensively, we 
really challenged them. The Tartans 
held W&J to shooting 31 percent for the 
game, 20 percent in the first half. With 
a lead that ballooned as big as 20, CMU 
stayed in front and fought off a late 
charge by W&J.
Saturday night, the Tartans fell at 
home to Grove City 90-75 in overtime.
We had a horrible first half, said 
Wingen. We battled back, sent it 
into overtime, then just had a 
miserable overtime.

themselves down by as much as 20 points 
in the first half. We forced a lot of shots

Club limps to semesters end
By JESSICA STRELITZ
Tartan Senior Staffwriter
The CMU hockey club rounded 
out its first semester of play on a 
down note by dropping two divi
sional games, to Edinboro and the 
Indiana University of Pennsylva
nia II team, and tying Lock Haven.
Frustration is the word that the 
team has been repeating over and 
over for the last two weeks. Frustra
tion for going winless in the last 
three weeks andbecause their record 
at the end of the first semester of 
play, 2-6-1, doesnt truly reflect the 
team that they are building.
A shorthanded squad traveled to 
Edinboro on Sunday, November 16. 
Edinboro went on the board first, 
but the first period looked strong. 
Grad student Jonathan Berkowitz 
scored from captain Paul Voulgaris 
and alternate captain Scott 
Fitzgerald, which was matchedminutes later by Fitzgeralds solo tally. 
Edinboro tied the game late in the 
period and scored again early in the 
second, but Fitzgerald tallied again,
from sophomore PJ 
Grzywacz and 
Berkowitz, to tie the 
game going into the 
third, 3-3.
Though they 
played well in the 
third, a goal was 
disallowed because 
Edinboro shoved 
Grzywacz into the 
crease. But their 
play seemed to 
spark the opposing 
squad. Edinboro 
scored and held the 
lead until the end, 
when they threw 
the puck into an

empty net to finish the game 5-3. CMU 
outshot Edinboro 33-28, but couldnt 
buy a bounce of the rubber. Goaltender 
Gil Min had 24 saves for CMU.
In a season, you want to win the 
games that you should win, said 
Min. We traveled four hours with 
an undermanned team; this game 
just wasnt the one that was sup
posed to happen.
Friday, CMU made a long journey to State 
College to play Lock Haven. This game was 
supposed to be a cakewalk. In the first period, 
junior Steve Leonhardt scored twice, first from 
senior Derek Jander and again from Jander 
and Voulgaris. Grad student Adam Duncan 
followed with two of his own goals, first from 
Fitzgerald four seconds after the face-off, the

Women place highly at Nationals meet
By MARSHALL WARFIELD
Dossier Literary Co-editor
Through rain and wind and sleet and hail, 
nothing stopped the womens cross country 
team this weekend at Nationals in Boston. 
They werent delivering the mail at Franklin 
Park, but if they were, they would have given 
Kevin Costner a run for his money. The 
womens cross country team wrapped up one 
of their best seasons ever with a 13th place 
finish outof21 teams at the National Womens 
Cross Country meet 
at Franklin Park 
in Boston.
Their 13th place 
finish was short of 
their expected topten finish, but the 
team did secure an
other slot for a fourth 
team to attend Na
tionals next year. This year, Dickinson went 
as the 4th slot team from our region.
Weather proved to be an insurmountable 
obstacle at the meet; it was raining, and the 
temperature was just above freeezing. About 
halfway through the race, the temperature 
dropped below freezing and the rain turned 
to sleet. You felt like you were running in 
place because your feet sank with every step,
said junior Maureen McGranaghan. Coach 
Dario Donatelli added, Ive been to some
where between 15 or 16 National meets, and 
these were undoubtedly the worst 
conditions Ive ever experienced. The 
teams 13th place finish was only 11 points 
from being in the top 10.
Margaret Powers placed ninth in the race. 
Taking the less crowded, but more slippery 
sides of the course, Powers managed to place 
incredibly well, considering the 184 finish
ers she was competing against. This ninth
Ive been to somewhere between 15 or 16 Na
tional meets and these were undoubtedly the 
worst conditions Ive ever experienced.
 Dario Donatelli, womens cross-country coach
place spot earned Powers an All-American 
spot and also the best finish in Carnegie 
Mellons cross country history at Nationals.
McGranaghan also earned All-American 
status with a 30th-place finish. This is the 
second year in a row that McGranaghan 
received an All-American finish. Her 
consistent performance also earned her 
another achievement. This weekend the team
learned that McGranaghan was voted the 
Regional Athlete of the Year, a title that 
certainly pays tribute to her ability and 
positive attitude.
Senior Melissa Lott finished 56th. Sopho; 
more Elizabeth Currid finished 165th; 
Sophomore Andrea Burns finished 174th, 
and freshman Katie James finished 180th, 
Places arent necessisarily the indicators of 
a strong team, though. Yes, we were hoping 
to be in the top ten, said Powers. It was a 
little dissapointing for everyone, but I know 
I ran the best race I could 
and I cant say that any
body else didnt do the 
same given the terrible 
conditions.
Much of the success of 
the team was attributed 
to Coach Donatelli. Dario 
knows exactly how to 
train a runner and taper 
them for big races and hes also really cool 
He cares a lot about all areas of your life, 
said Currid.
I feel the team did fine. At the start, 1 
looked over at the other runners next to me,

race, or who I had to compete against. What 
I thought about was how incredible it.was to

Programs provide 
relaxation outlet
By SETH MANDEL
Tartan Junior Staff
In an effort to provide students with some time away from their books, 
several programs have been scheduled throughout finals week to give stu
dents something to do that does not involve studying.
TAKE A BREAK
Carnegie Mellon is an intense academic environment where students want 
to succeed, and in order to succeed, there needs to be a balance between 
academic and intellectual excellence and social and personal time/ said Lisa 
Dingman, coordinator of first-year programs for Student Life.
For this reason, Dingman has helped organize a study break for first-year 
students on Thursday, December 11, from 8 to 11 pm in the West Wing TV 
room. The goal of this program is to provide a stress-free atmosphere where 
students can watch Thursday night television and eat healthy study snacks.
This is particularly useful for first-year students, because this will be their 
first college final exam experience, which can be avery stressful time. We want 
to make sure they have an opportunity to unwind and not let stress build up, 
as well as to connect with other first-year students who are going through the 
same experience, said Dingman.
I might stop by after that evenings final. It will be a good way to refresh 
myself so I can take my next final the following day, said Eric Medlin, a firstyear economics and information and decision systems major.
MAKE THE GRADE
In addition, the First-Year Partnership (FYP) program will be sponsoring a 
final exam preparation session to provide first year students with test taking 
strategies and techniques for making it through final exams with as little 
stress as possible. Mark Stehlik from SCS and Steve Pajewski from H&SS 
Academic Advising will facilitate the event, which will be held on December 4 
in the Mudge piano lounge from 6:30. to 7:30 pm. Upperclass students will 
answer questions and share their experiences with the first-year students. 
Although this is an FYP program, all first-year students are welcome and 
encouraged to attend.
I attended last years FYP exam preparation session when I was a first-year 
student. I have to admit that I wasnt expecting much; I didnt feel that a small 
session of tips and techniques could really make a difference. But I went, and 
the program surprised me. It didnt focus so much on specific techniques as it 
shaped an attitude and general approach towards final exams, said Scott 
Shell, a sophomore chemical engineering major and FYP student assistant.
EAT FOR FREE
Programming during finals week is not limited to freshmen, however. The 
Greek Community and the Office of Student Activities will be holding the 
Almost Midnight Breakfast this year on December 9, from 10 pm until 
midnight at the Highlander Cafe. Organized by students, this event is 
intended to be a fun activity that provides students with a break and a free 
meal, as well as an opportunity to be served breakfast by faculty and staff. Held 
for the past several years, this event has been extremely successful, with 
approximately 600 to 800 students attending each year, according to Barbara 
Prevost, coordinator of Student Activities.
It was a nice time to get away from studying for finals, be with friends, and 
get free food. I got to talk to the faculty and have them make my food, said 
Audry McAfee, a fifth-year senior economics major who attended the Almost 
Midnight Breakfast last year.
The most important aspect of the program is to show the student body 
that not everything on this campus requires a fee, and that students hard 
work is appreciated and understood by the faculty and staff. [Also, that the 
faculty and staff] are willing to give the students a break for all of the 
hard work that they have done, says Lori VanNewkirk, a senior policy 
and management major who will oversee the event as Panhellenic 
president. VanNewkirk also added that in addition to other faculty and 
staff members, President Cohon and his wife have agreed to come to the event 
and help cook and serve students this year.
MORE FREE FOOD
In addition, the Student Dormitory Council will be planning several events 
during finals week to help students have some fun and relax. 
According to Sarah Frew, a senior biology major and the SDC residential 
programming chair, donuts, and bagels will be distributed in the residence 
halls on the two Sunday evenings before exams. Furthermore, SDC will 
once again be hosting Primal Scream, an event where large amounts of pizza 
are ordered and served by the fence at midnight. This event is intended to 
provide students with a way to relieve stress and socialize. Frew also says 
that some special movies will be shown, as well as the possibility of some 
brand new events this year.
Finals week is a great time for people to get the chance to have a little fun. 
No classes are scheduled and most people will have a block of free time when 
they dont have any finals scheduled, so they should be able to participate in 
something carefree and non-stressful. Its important that students know that 
they can take a break from it all when they need to, and I feel that its important 
for student organizations to provide those opportunities, said Frew.
In addition to these programs, muffins, juice, and coffee will be distributed 
every morning of finals outside of Doherty Hall. According to Prevost, this free 
food is intended to be a good luck message from the Division of Student Affairs. 
While the University wants students to succeed academically, they also 
recognize the importance of relaxing and maintaining good mental health 
during this stressful period of the year.
Anxiety Attack!!
Internal focus combats tension
By BECKY A. COWSER
Tartan Features Editor
Close your eyes and take a deep breath. 
The saying has become clich, but in Qi 
Gong, these everyday actions suppos
edly lead to greater relaxation and pow
ers of concentration.
Last Thursday, students got to find out 
for themselves at an hour-long program 
where some basic concepts of Qi Gong were 
demonstrated by Dr. Linda Kurtonick.
I think our whole culture has 
been taught to go externally for solu
tions, but by learning to go internally 
through meditation and Qi Gong we 
learn to find peace and 
har mony, said Kurtonick.
Qi Gong originated in China. 
According to Kurtonick, the 
heart of its philosophy is the 
concept that the breath is the
link between the mind and the body  
by controlling the breath, one can con
trol the mind. In this way, breathing 
methods help to reduce stress, slow the 
heart rate, and improve methods 
of concentration.
Jeff Lauzon, coordinator of Health 
Education, said he thought that the Qi 
Gong program was successful. While 
he hoped to see more students turn out 
for the session, he was pleased with 
the attendance.
I think [the programs benefits] are 
obvious because students are so stressed.
What those [breathing] methods teach 
are a decrease in stress and also an 
increase in energy, said Lauzon. The 
benefits of taking ten minutes to breathe 
are important. Its like some people take 
a break to go smoke a cigarette, but if 
everyone would take that time to go 
outside and breathe or meditate, it would 
really help them.
During the Qi Gong session, Kurtonick 
explained the ways to find the power of 
the Qi and focused mainly on breathing 
methods. According to her, thousands of 
years of research have proven that these 
breathing practices are among the. 
most effective ways to control stress 
and concentrate.
Kids today dont know how 
to handle stress. Their idea of how to 
handle stress is to work hard all week 
and get blown away on the weekends,

Finals revive stress-relief tactics
By NEEMA AVASHIA
Tartan Staffwriter
Homework, exams, end-of-semester 
projects, finals, relationships, and life 
in general. With all of these things to 
think about, its no wonder so many 
students at CMU are stressed out. And, 
as the end of the semester rapidly ap
proaches, the stress will only increase. 
At times, the 24 hours that make up the 
day arent even enough to get every
thing done. Some students have prob
lems learning how to deal with stress
ful situations, but others rely on the 
tactics that theyve perfected over time 
to relax a little.
Just as people react 
to stress in different 
ways, they also have 
different ways of re
lieving stress. Sleep
ing, eating, working 
out, getting together 
with friends, and con
suming chemical sub
stances are but a few of 
the ways in which CMU 
students relieve stress.
For sophomore En
glish major Susie
Cribbs, sleeping, 
listening to music, 
and hanging out 
with friends helps her 
deal with tension.
Using sleep as an 
outlet for stress and 
agression is very  
effective for some of 
the student body.
I sleep and eat lots 
of chocolate, said Tejal 
Teli, a sophomore chem
istry major, describing the stress-relieving habits that work best for her.
Smoking, drinking, and drugs also 
ranked high on a list of stress relievers 
for many students. I smoke cigarettes 
and run  but not at the same time, 
said Rachel Whipple, undeclared firstyear student in H&SS.
Accordingto senior math major Manoo 
Halati, CMU students are more likely to 
drink during finals time as their stress
levels increase. For Halati himself, a 
good way to relieve stress is to go out on 
weekends and drink sometimes.
In addition, cutting loose and participatingin enjoyable activities was thought 
to be a good way to reduce stress. I watch 
TV, I smoke.too muchand I sing and 
scream in a band. I also like to sleep and 
sometimes I drink or dress up like a Solid 
Gold dancer, said Erica Vogel, a sopho
more in creative writing and history. 
Senior history major Chad Heald likes to 
reduce stress by relaxing, playing his 
guitar, and watching movies.
time out for a few chores. I tend to get 
very disorganized and my room becomes 
a catastrophic mess, he said.
Being around close friends and 
talking to family members are also effec
tive methods for students dealing 
with tension. I call my mom, 
said Christy Hipchen, a senior in 
professional writing.
Talking to important people in her 
life is also a stress relief for Stephanie 
Hoban, a sophomore chemical engineer
ing major, who calls her sisters
While some students like to alleviate 
stress by relaxing, others choose to do 
work  either physical exercise or 
mental gymnastics. Ill go for a run, or 
Ill read a book for the fun of it, said 
Vanessa Dorn, a freshman in chem
ical engineering.
Sudhir Reddy, a senior psychology 
major, also likes to do work to alleviate 
stress, but his method involves taking
or just hangs out with friends to 
relax and ease some of the conflict in 
her life.
Facing the finalization of classes and 
work at a university such as CMU, it is 
likely that many students are going 
to be stressing out over the next few 
weeks. Hopefully, their personal meth
ods of dealing with it will be enough to 
get them through to Christmas break.

Soon, Pittsburgh will have a new work
ing resource for city planning and devel
opment. Paul Decker, an associate pro
fessor in CMUs School of Architecture, 
has, for the past three years, been work
ing on Virtual Pittsburgh, a threedimensional computer model of the city. 
The Pittsburgh Chapter of the Ameri
can Institute of Architects presented 
Decker with the Citation of Merit (Open 
Plan Award) for his work on Virtual 
Pittsburgh on November 17.
A comprehensive model featuring 
everything from buildings to public 
spaces to rivers, Virtual Pittsburgh 
promises to be very useful in city plan
ning and marketing.
The models have been used to gener
ate a variety of graphical studies, in 
combination or separately, Decker said. 
If properly utilized, it could give Pitts
burgh an edge in the support of public 
process portions of its urban manage
ment, and if used as an outreach and
advertising tool, it could help market 
the city as a leading-edge player and 
attractive place to set up business.
Deckers models categorize parts of 
the map in terms of public space, retail 
space, office spaee, rivers, and so forth 
by color-coding them. This allows users 
to formulate and test planning propos
als by observing the current status of 
the city. Air and traffic flow and vacancy 
rates of buildings in the area are among 
the dynamics that can be accessed and 
analyzed through the computer model 
that Decker created.
Decker began rendering the project in 
the fall of 1994, when he was hired to 
work on the North Shore Plan, provid
ing modeling and ideas services. Future 
development plans for Oakland 
began in the fall of 1995, and, in the 
spring of 1996 he was hired by architect 
Michael Stern, director of the plan 
and adjunct faculty member in the School 
of Architecture, to work on the Pitts
burgh Downtown Plan.
The project involved various types of 
research and data gathering. The
models baseplans were built from [hard 
copy] maps, and buildings were con
structed from a combination of 
field surveys, reference to other models, 
and photographs.
Architecture Magazine reviewed the 
early design plans for the model of the 
Pittsburgh Downtown Plan in June 1997.
Intended to be for analytical and de
sign purposes, the model already fea
tures Downtown, the near North Shore, 
the South Shore from Station Square to 
Mt. Washington, Lawrenceville, Oak
land, and Carnegie Mellon University. 
According to Decker, the Downtown and 
Oakland models were rendered for the 
Department of Planning of the City of 
Pittsburgh and are meant to be a public 
resource. But he said that certain 
issues of maintenance and policy 
remain to be resolved.
Decker, along with University Archi
tect Paul Tellers and Director 
of Planning Services Kevin Lamb, 
is nearing completion on developing 
a master plan model of the CMU 
campus, including some off-campus sites.
The CMU model is the most detailed, 
and the Downtown portion is the most 
comprehensive, said Decker. The CMU 
model itself could become the interface 
of a real property management system, 
making certain types of management 
more efficient. Once fully developed, es
pecially in light of the kind of talent at 
this university, this could become a sig
nificant product, as well as a showpiece 
for the University.
Decker had been operating as an urban 
design consultant in Cincinnati and in 
Denver before coming to Pittsburgh. Now 
an associate professor in the School of 
Architecture at CMU, Decker is in the 
process of easing into full-time practice, 
and next semester he will be an adjunct.
Ive been an academic for ten years, 
and I need to do this, he said. I will 
probably involve myself with some type 
of practice involving urban scale. I do 
want to develop these modeling 
ideas further, although at this level, just 
modeling, I mean, Ive reached an 
intellectual limit. I am open to 
suggestions, however.

The last few weeks of classes are roll
ing around, and the wheels of the semes
ter are grinding to a halt. While this 
means a well-deserved break for the hard
working students of CMU, it also means 
the end of the first semester of presidency 
for Jared Cohon. If you think first-year 
students are the only ones who reflect 
about their first months at CMU, youre 
wrong. The Tartan caught up with Cohon 
to get his memories of the semester 
past, and some general information to 
help us formulate what the semesters 
future might be like with the eighth 
president of CMU.
The Tartan: Well, what did you think 
of your first semester at CMU?
Jared Cohon: I loved it. First, Id have 
to say that Carnegie Mellon is a great 
place, and its even better up close than 
it seems to be from afar. Thats a won
derful thing to find out. Everyone has 
been extremely nice and welcoming, and 
Id even extend that [sentiment] to the 
entire Pittsburgh community.
TT: Have there been any events or 
exciting activities this first semester that 
youll remember?
JC: Where do I start? Homecoming 
was terrific. Seeing all of those people in 
the stands at the football game was 
amazing. Conducting was fun  the 
band is great. The [Homecoming] instal
lation was also an event that was very 
important to me. Also, the one play we 
saw, Philadelphia Story, was fantastic. 
We wished we could have gone to more.... 
I also went to the opening session of the 
Creative Writing Anniversary and re
ally enjoyed that.
But Id have to say that what I enjoyed 
most [about the semester] was sitting 
down and talking with the students and 
faculty. Ive gotten around to meet with 
every department of faculty, and thats 
been fun. Its fun to meet one-on-one, but

its also fun to meet in groups because 
theres a certain dynamic there.
TT: Were there any surprises about 
CMU? Things you didnt anticipate be
fore you really got to know campus?
JC: No real surprises. I think 
what Ive learned basically reinforces 
my perceptions of the place. Its 
hard-working, likes to break new 
grounds.... I have found, though, that 
we seem to be more successful at inter
disciplinary research than inter-col
lege teaching. More students are tak
ing more classes outside of their col
leges, and one of my challenges is to 
get to the point where students and 
faculty identify more with the Univer
sity as a whole than just with their 
college without losing the good things 
about college loyalty.
TT: So, youve been here for a semes
ter now  do you have a favorite place 
on campus?
JC: I like the University Center, but 
I only go there for events. Im 
always struck by the size of the place, 
and how many activities can take place 
there. I [also] love the Fine Arts 
building. Just going in there is a 
trip, and theres so much energy.... 
Also, seeing Hamerschlag Hall at 
night from Forbes as youre driving 
toward CMU.
TT: How does that feel, to see the 
Hamerschlag smokestack at.night and 
know that youre the President of CMU?
JC: That you asked the question means 
you know what it feels like. Its a source of 
pride. It still surprises me, like Gee! Im 
the president! Its a very good feeling.
TT: What would you give to the cam
pus, if you could give us one Christmas 
present?
JC: $600 million more in endowments. 
That would, of course, be a present to 
myself too, since I am responsible for 
raising the money. But at the same time, 
I would say, now that were richer, lets 
not change. Were very lucky... this dedi
cation to work, interest in everyday things 
as well as theoretical things  these are 
characteristics that other universities 
wish they had, and CMU has them.
TT: If you could be anything else 
besides president of CMU, what 
would you be?
JC: I guess the only other thing Id 
want to do in my life is be a really good 
rock drummer and tour Europe.
TT: Why Europe?
JC: Because its glamorous. Just to be 
able to say Im a rock drummer, and I 
toured the capitals of Europe. We had a 
great band at Johns Hopkins when I was 
a professor. It was comprised mainly of 
doctoral students.
TT: Really? What would you play?
JC: Everything from Elvis Presley to 
Elvis Costello.
TT: Any plans to start a band at CMU?
JC: If I had the talent and the time, Id 
do it without hesitation  but I dont 
have either. Maybe someone will let me 
sit in with them.
TT: Do you miss Yale?
JC: We love New England, but 
Pittsburgh is better than New 
Haven in a lot of ways.... I miss my 
colleagues and students at Yale. Its 
wonderful place.
TT: If you had to sum up your experi
ence as president of CMU during the 
last semester in one sentence, what 
would that sentence be?
JC: Being president of Carnegie Mell
on for a semester is being the proudest, 
biggest kid in the candy store.

Society stigmatizes 
feminine hygiene
Cracking the Myth
by Elizabeth Irvine
Last year, I went to the University 
Center to request that the tampon 
machines be filled in all the womens 
bathrooms in the building. While one 
might think this is a simple request, 
it has been a year, and it still hasnt 
been done. Granted, there have 
been administrative changes, and Im 
sure many people are busy, but the 
situation delves into a deeper issue 
than this. Menstruation has always 
been a taboo subject. Even the 
mention of sanitary napkins makes 
both men and women squirm. The 
UC administrations reaction to my 
request is symbolic of our underlying 
cultural ideas of menstruation.
Another example of how we cloak 
menstruation in acceptable terms is 
television commercials for feminine 
hygiene products. On TV, tampons or 
maxi pads are portrayed as flowery, 
pink, and pretty. They make 
menstruation out to be some secret, 
important bond between women 
who knowingly slip each other tam
pons at parties.
The very fact that the abundance of 
feminine hygiene products are adver
tised primarily during the day  es
pecially1 during soap operas  rein
forces the cultural conception of men
struation as womens business. The 
subject is either shown in Commer
cials as ultra-serious or a trite teen
age interaction between two girls dis
cussing their periods in gym class.
Either way, menstruation becomes 
this ridiculously mysteris, private, 
and . female semi-shameful ritual 
of sorts. Because we are unable to 
have open discussions about 
menstruation, it is made to 
seem worse than it really is. 
Our accepted discourse on menstrua
tion leaves the actualities of it to 
the imagination.
Unlike commercials for headache 
medicine, tampon ads have no voice 
of medical authority. Menstruation 
in these advertisements is never spo
ken of in medical terms and is in
stead addressed in trivial language. 
This is if any relatively technical 
language is used at all. There are 
some tampon commercials in which 
women sit around drinking coffee and 
talking about You know... that time 
of the month. If women who experi
ence menstruation cant even bring 
themselves to articulate it, how can 
we expect society to accept that a 
womans period is not a dirty thing 
unfit for conversation?
The way tampons are portrayed in 
commercials makes them seem like 
they arent about relieving symptoms, 
but are instead about hiding a natu
ral bodily function. Because society 
dictates that women are supposed to 
be clean and pretty, menstruation 
must follow suit. Hence, companies 
launch pink and purple advertising 
campaigns about how to stay 
fresh and never let anyone know 
youre on your period.
In the 70s, a group of artists at the 
feminist art program at California 
State College at Fresno tried to bridge 
the discrepancies between menstrua
tion and its societal portrayal. In the 
Womanhouse exhibit, there was an 
installation entitled Menstruation 
Bathroom which contrasted the frilly 
images fed to us via advertising and 
marketing against the actual ramifi
cations of having your period, such as 
bloody tampons.
Having ones period boils down to 
yet another aspect of the feminine 
mystique  in order for society to 
accept menstruation, it must be glam
orized. Until we decide to take it 
upon ourselves to start unpacking 
representations of women in general
 from their appearances to their 
roles in society  menstruation will 
continue to be a stigma.

major with concentrations in art and

Quilt shows more than names
By REENA SINGHAL
Tartan Staffwriter
I miss the tears, I miss the laughter. 
Sometimes I wish I could always be with 
you. Beginning a poem to remember a 
loved one, this quote is written on one of 
the panels of the AIDS Memorial Quilt, 
a quilt which has been sewn to remem
ber the thousands of victims of the dis
ease across the world. Six blocks of 
panels of this quilt are on display in 
the Rangos Ballroom until Tuesday 
evening for the 
entire CMU com
munity to view 
and experience.
According to Bar
bara Prevost, coor
dinator of Student 
Activities, the pan
els have been 
brought to the cam
pus to help the CMU 
community remem
ber all those who 
have died of AIDS 
and to raise aware
ness of how many 
people have been 
touched by the 
disease. The panels 
are being displayed 
to help celebrate 
and recognize De
cember 1, World 
AIDS Day. Besides 
representing all 
those who are vic
tims of the disease, The AIDS Quilt will 
the quilt also stands
for all the anger, love, sorrow, and hope 
of the people who have made the panels.
Each colorful 3-by-6-foot panel of the 
quilt has been created by the families, 
friends, coworkers, and organizations 
of a person or a group of people who 
have been victims of AIDS. The panels 
themselves are very personal, accord
ing to junior Kelly McPhee, a psychol
ogy and professional writing major and 
the group coordinator of AdvocAIDS. 
Most contain the names of the victims 
being remembered, their birth dates 
and death dates, and the names or sig
natures of those who have created the 
square of the quilt. Besides these simi
larities, the panels are extremely di
verse and represent how the disease 
affects everyone, not a particular race, 
gender, age, or nationality. Many of 
these quilt components have sentimen
tal memorabilia attached to them to
help memorialize the loss of the person. 
Everything from t-shirts, vests, ribbons, 
and patches, to teddy bears, college 
pennants, photographs, poems, and love 
letters have been included 
in individual panels. Colorful images, 
which have been cut out from felt 
or painted on, such as flowers, butter
flies, sunshines, and handprints are 
also included on many of the panels.
There is enough of a variety for 
everyone to find a panel that they can 
identify with and understand,while the quilt 
on display.
Lisette Mlller-Dlxon/Tartan Darkroom Manager 
be on display in Rangos Hall Monday and Tuesday.
which makes it even more meaningful, 
said McPhee.
Duane Williams, a senior research 
programmer in the Robotics Institute, 
along with Donn Hoffman, helped put 
together the first display of the project 
about five years ago, in Hunt Library. 
According to Williams, they put on this 
display without any official cooperation 
and were unable to get panels from the 
San Franscisco NAMES project, but were 
able to get a few panels from a chapter in 
Ohio. Along with these panels, they cre
ated their own personal panel which is 
6-by-6-feet, twice the size of the typical 
quilt panel, specifically for Carnegie 
Mellon. It includes the names, class 
years, and colleges of some CMU stu
dents who have been victims of the epi
demic. This panel is displayed again 
this year, in the center of the room, 
among the panels from the San Fran
cisco NAMES project. According to Wil
liams, it doesnt include the names of all 
the victims of AIDS at CMU, but it helps 
recognize some of them.
We made it for the purpose of making 
the Carnegie Mellon community aware; 
that AIDS is not just a problem off 
campus. It reminds everyone that AIDS, 
even affects our own campus commu
nity, said Williams.
McPhee has also organized a reading of 
names of victims of AIDS that will take 
place in Rangos
is
According to 
McPhee, the name 
reading vocally re
members those 
who have died.
It makes it even 
more meaningful; 
because you may 
hear your name 
or your first name 
[during the read
ing], said McPhee, 
However, McPhee; 
adds that the most 
important part is 
to see the quilt, not 
necessarily to hear 
the names.
When its dis
played in its 
entirety, its a way 
of remembering 
and illustrating 
how many people 
have been affected 
by AIDS, said 
McPhee. The quift 
is the largest example of a community 
art project in the world, and it continues 
to grow as more and more people become 
victims of the disease.
On November 30, there will be a 
dedication ceremony of new quilt pan
els at the Shadyside Presbyterian 
Church to recognize those who will 
now be forever remembered in the AIDS 
Memorial Quilt and their loved ones 
who have survived them. There 
will also be an AIDS memorial service 
at Temple Sinai in Squirrel Hill on 
December 1.
The quilt display at Carnegie Mellon 
was sponsored by AdvocAIDS, Health 
Services, the Office of Student Life, ancl 
the Office of Student Activities.
Im glad we were able to bring panels 
here this year, and we hope this pro
vides people with the opportunity to 
experience them, said Prevost.Breathing methods, meditation grant concentration
STRESS, from page LI
which is bad for the body and the 
mind, said Kurtonick.
Lauzon said that he would like 
to offer more programs for stu
dents, but he would also like to see 
more students get involved. Stu
dents who take that horn* [to re
lease stress]  I bet theyre more 
productive the next hour than those 
who kept studying, said Lauzon.
The students who attended the 
program understood the concepts 
that Kurtonick was teaching but 
some were skeptical about their 
practical uses.
I didnt get too much out of it. 
I felt relaxed, but I didnt feel 
any major Qi powers, said Erin 
McLaughlin, a first year Univer
sity Choice student.
Finding the still point in the 
center of the being is how 
Kurtonick described the powers 
of Qi. According to her, the use of 
Qi Gong can improve the ability
to take concept learning and ap
ply it to situations more readily.
Qi Gong is a great thing for 
CMU students. But are we really 
ready for it? In serious Qi Gong 
practice, people change their own 
life styles and character, said 
Huan Chang, a sophomore com
puter science major.
If people who try Qi Gong prac
tice it as a form of physical 
excercise, then they will get the 
benefit of a physical excercise that 
has had 5000 years to perfect. If 
people practice Qi Gong as a medi
tation for mental relaxation, then 
they will recive the benefit of a a 
relaxation technique that has been 
tried, tested, reformed, re-tested 
for 5000 years. But if we can try, 
and truly incorporate methods of 
Qi Gong in to our modem life, the 
result will be the combination of 
5000 years worth of knowledge 
and experience about human na
ture and modem day science and
technology. This can really help 
us to live happier and more 
successful! lives, he said.
We cause ourselves to be 
stressed because stress is really 
in the eye of the beholder, said 
Kurtonick. The past is dead and 
the future is imagined. We must 
live in the present moment. When 
we live in the present moment, 
we are more healthy.
Since finals are approaching, 
Lauzon said he thinks all stu
dents could really benefit from
stress-relief tactics. While Qi 
Gong is one way of approaching 
this, so are the personal joys of 
individual students. According to 
Lauzon, relieving stress can be 
as simple as taking a hike or 
reading a book' for pleasure.
I dont know if I personally 
would [attend another Qi Gong 
program], said McLaughlin. Im 
more of an exercise-to-get-rid-ofthe-stress person.
Kurtonick claims that the Qi 
Gong method is extremely effec
tive, especially for students. She 
said that she saved many of 
her friends lives when she was in 
her doctoral program by 
teaching them the breathing and 
meditation exercises.
You think, Id just rather take 
this time for myself, but you dont 
take it in a productive way, said 
Lauzon. Sitting at your computer 
playing solitaire for an hour is 
nowhere near as effective as tak
ing that hour, or even ten min
utes, to meditate.
Chang said that Health Ser
vices should definetly sponsor 
more programs like Qi Gong to 
increase campus understanding. 
I would recommand it to others, 
he said. But I fear that some
times, a failed demonstration will 
lead people away from Qi Gong, 
preventing them from ever tr}- 
ing it out again. If we do invit 
more speakers, they need to 
be very experienced practitio
ners as well as skilled presenta
tion makers.

Under stress or time pressure people may rationalize that 
no one is hurt if a student takes a shortcut. But each 
persons attitudes and actions contribute to our individual 
and community standards. Giving in to these urges also 
means giving up a measure of personal integrity. Bit by bit, 
what may seem like small ethical compromises sacrifice the 
integrity of our academic community. Promoting academic 
integrity is the responsibility of the entire Carnegie Mellon 
community.

edre: Music that tests the limits
Bands learn the ropes
By RYAN DONOVAN
Tartan Assistant Diversions Editor
Everyones in a band these days. 
Bars that had shows once or twice a 
week now have bands every night. 
Many of them have albums, singles, 
and 7-inch records. But few of them 
have record contracts.
So how do these musicians put out 
records and function without a record com
pany to back them up? The answer: 
They do it themselves.
Some of these bands actually 
own and operate their own 
record companies. Robert 
Griffin founded the band 
Prison Shake and their 
record company, Scat Records, which 
he runs almost single-handedly. Griffin 
does everything for his band, including 
the accounting and part of the booking. 
He has a hand in designing every record 
the label puts out (if he doesnt design it 
entirely by himself).
About the only thing a do-it-yourself 
(DIY for short) musician doesnt actually 
do for their record is press it. This is the 
part where the recording (usually on a 
DAT, a digital audio tape) is mastered and 
pressed into either vinyl or a CD.
There are no pressing facilities in Pitts
burgh, so any DIY musicians in town 
have to send their stuff to places as far as 
Florida and beyond, depending on their 
cost requirements.
But, occasionally, a band will also press 
 their own vinyl.
o According to Arthur Allen, an employee
at Brave New World Records on Craig 
Street, the band Dead Moon has the lathe 
that supposedly cut the first copy of Louie, 
Louie in a cabin located in the backwoods of
Oregon that serves as their base camp.
Once the record is made, the problems begin. To 
get the record out to the people, DIYers have two 
options: find a distributor, or deal with the record 
stores directly.
Both have painful flaws. Distributors arent 
always reliable. We made the mistake of dealing 
with these Rhode Island kids, said senior techni
cal writing major Doug Mosurak, who also is one of 
seven people country-wide who operate the Peas 
Kor label, who have put out records by the Karl 
Hendrix Trio, Hurl, and Davenport, among others. 
Not only does Peas Kor have no word on how many 
records were sold by these kids (and therefore no 
money from them), but they also dont have their 
records, which are currently out of print and valu
able to Peas Kor.
Dealing with record stores is another can of 
worms. Record stores might give bands three or 
four bucks for each repord, if theyre lucky. You 
get more respect as a record company than as a 
band, said Tom Jagger, guitarist for Third Man. 
Without this respect, a record store will usually: 
only sell the records on a consignment basis.
Youve got to watch where you go, said John 
Roman, the drummer for The 1985. If the band or 
the store loses the consignment slips, then nobody 
gets paid.
Getting paid is one of the hardest parts of being' 
without the protection of a record company. While 
its usually tougher to get money from record 
stores, clubs and bars can be equally torturous.; 
Jagger, who used to play with a now-defunct band! 
called Davenport, has experienced the rougher 
end of touring at a show in Philadelphia. The guy; 
who ran the show left early, leaving the doorman' 
in charge of the money. Then, the doorman left; 
with the money.
For the DIY band, touring is what keeps them 
alive. Touring can get your name out there,  
said Roman. But name recognition gets you the  
shows. This cycle is often hard to start. At this:

Tartan Diversions Editor'
' Ever since Nirvana hit the scene in the

The labels loosely identify a wide 
range of acts that incorporate some as
pects of American country into their 
sound, said Zimring.
Little-known bands have been cropthe grunge movement in music, large- ping up in publications, and even on
scale record labels and music lovers alike 
have been searching for the next big 
thing. The music world has not yet seen 
anothergenre spawned from truly inde
pendent roots. But recently, with the 
rise of insurgent or alternative coun
try, the wasteland of packaged pop 
night be fading into a mirage.
| The music industry has termed this 
$cene No Depression, based partly on an 
album title by the now-defunct Uncle Tu
pelo and partly on a fan magazine of the 
same title. It encompasses an extensive 
range of acts, most of which are new and 
Supported by independent record labels.
! Carl Zimring, a doctoral student in 
history and WRCT DJ for Fear and 
Whiskey, a show about No Depression, 
said that insurgent country is much more 
than the traditional country/western 
that the general public hears.
some major labels, such as Son Volt, 
Wilco, the Old 97s, and Whiskeytown. 
Artists draw on sounds as diverse as 
blues, jazz, folk, country, and bluegrass. 
Johnny Cash and Neil Young, along 
with Merle Haggard, are artists that 
todays bands tap.
These [influences] may result in 
quiet, folk-based balladeers, loud 
twangy punk acts, or country/rock sing
ers, said Zimring.
Like the grunge scene, No Depression 
is a grassroots movement, begun in clubs 
and on indie labels.
But unlike grunge, which grew out of 
the Seattle music scene and drew in
fluences from British punk, No De
pression has no specific locations to 
draw countless acts from; its spread 
throughout the country. Its also a 
purely American creation, considered
to have roots in Nashville and Raleigh 
rather than London or Berlin.
Many No Depression artists use the 
Web to promote their albums and tour 
dates. No Depression, the fan magazine, 
runs an online version. Discussion of No 
Depression started in a chat room on 
America Online before the movement 
caught any press attention.
Paul Olszewski, owner of Pauls CDs 
on Liberty Avenue, said that No De
pression has renewed his faith in the 
music industry.
So much stuff is forced down your 
throat, said Olszewski. MTV, and 
corporate radio ... No Depression -is 
different. A lot of the [artists]... know 
the history. They know the music be
hind it, and theyre adding to it. I think 
country music has kind of deteriorated 
into acts like Garth Brooks, with the 
cowboy hat and the huge stage. But 
artists like Robbie Fulks [come] on 
stage in a t-shirt and sneakers, with
out any of the trappings of country 
music pop.
Although No Depression is not based
out of a specific region 
or city, Pittsburgh still f 
remains without a large 
following.
The Deliberate Strang-. 
ers are one of the few local alterna
tive country bands based out of Pitts
burgh. Their guitarist, Tom Moran, said 
that they sell more albums outside of 
Pittsburgh than in the city.
In Pittsburgh, there are us and 
another band called the Polish Hillbillies, said 
Moran. Pittsburgh is still 
pretty dry. But its still a 
relatively small sub-genre 
in music.
But No Depression has not 
gone completely unnoticed 
in Pittsburgh. The 
strip districts 
Rosebud/Metropol will soon be 
starting No Depression 
Wednesdays, and has already 
been bringing in acts like Beth 
Orton, Robbie Fulks, Maia Sharp, 
and Cornershop.
Jungle blends electrnica into thriving Pittsburgh scene
By RYAN D. SCHILLING
Tartan Assistant News Editor
j Jungle. For most people, the 
word brings up images of lush 
rain forests, murky brown rivers, 
(ions, and maybe even 
Tarzan. One might 
lso think o'"
Sounds of m 
keys chat
tering
in the trees above.
But for small and devout groups 
of people, jungle brings to mind 
something entirely different. 
They think of trippy music with 
sampled breakbeats 
^ ^ ,, (funky drums
played
o n
older soul records as opposed to 
the 4/4 beat prevalent in most 
techno and house) sped up to 180 
beats per minute. They think of 
D Js spinning vinyl. They think of 
raves and clubs with people from 
many different groups coming 
together on their one common 
ground; jungle music.
Jungle began in the United 
Kingdom as a mix of hip-hop and 
rave. This spawned drum nbass, 
as jungle is also called. Some of 
the pioneers of jungle were DJs 
such as Fabio and Grooverider. 
Grooverider started DJing hiphop, house, and acid-jazz. But he 
followed drum n bass through 
its prenatal stages as an off
shoot of hardcore and breakbeat
 techno until the style became a 
genre in its own right. This 
style became known as 
jungle.
Recently, jungles popular
ity in the United States has 
exploded. Jungle is still very 
much an East Coast thing, 
said alumni Manny Theiner, 
a D J at WRCT whose experi
mental show on Thursdays often 
plays jungle music. Pittsburgh 
would probably be considered 
under the umbrella of the Philly 
scene, said Theiner.
Today, jungle is so big that it 
even has its own categories. Al
though there are many more than 
this, such as ragga, techstep, and 
darkside, you can classify jungle 
into two very distinct groups: in
telligent/ambient and hardstep.
The jungle that is most popular 
in Pittsburgh is the dance-ori
ented style. Club Laga in Oak
land has a night of jungle called 
Steel City Jungle.
Another aspect of jungle is that 
it attracts so many different 
kinds of people. Senior ECE 
major John Arroyo, a DJ at 
WRCT, said, At Laga, although 
most of the crowd are ravers, 
some are club kids and some just 
plain Pittsburgh or college kids. 
I even see an occasional sorority 
girl or frat boy. Its all good be
cause most everyone dances. 
Also, at most raves in Pittsburgh 
youll have a jungle DJ.
There have also been a number 
of good jungle DJs from Pitts
burgh. Recently, 1.8.7., who left 
for Philadelphia with a record deal 
on the national record label Jungle 
Sky released an album called 
When Worlds Collide. In fact, one 
of the tracks was recorded live at 
Lagas Steel City Jungle.
Sophomore social and decision 
sciences major Erica Coslor, di
rector of RPM at WRCT, said 
Pittsburghs jungle DJs all seem 
to be leaving [though] Dieselboy 
and Starchild (who both got their 
starts in Pittsburgh) are tearing it 
up in Philly and New York now. 
Radio also is a good source of 
jungle. Coslor said, I usually play 
jungle for the first half of my 
radio show, and most of the other 
techno DJs at the station also 
play some jungle.
Free radio Carson, WRCT, and 
WPTS all have jungle shows, 
said Arroyo. Some of the DJs are 
new to spinning, but people like 
Pavlo [on WRCT] rip it up every 
week. He gets respect for his drum 
n bass skills.
The other dominant type of; 
jungle, intelligent and ambient,; 
is geared toward the home lis-; 
tener. This type of jungle is gen-; 
erally much more complicated; 
than other forms. It uses more 
challenging drumlines and; 
breakbeats while sometimes even; 
using string and choral arrange-; 
ments. Intelligent jungle is best; 
when listened to with a good set 
of speakers or headphones at loud 
volume in your room. Some of the 
more distinguished commercial 
intelligent jungle artists include; 
Squarepusher, Plug, and even; 
some of the more recent Aphex1 
Twin. Much of the intelligent 
jungle available has its roots in 
jazz and dub. Some of the more; 
influential artists are Miles; 
Davis, Charlie Parker, and; 
Augustus Pablo.
There is also a large market; 
for commercial jungle in the; 
U.K., and this market is rap-; 
idly expanding in the U.S. Some; 
of the notables are Goldie,; 
Photek, Spring Heel Jack, Roni ; 
Size, and Mu-ziq.

Classic rockers live album shows roots
By ANDY FRANCIS
Tartan Staff writer
Although they produced some of the 
most compelling rock n roll ever on 
their nine studio albums, Led Zeppelin 
was, first and foremost, a live band. 
Previously, the only concert work of 
theirs available was from the film Song 
Remains the Same, a disc which really 
did not meet the bands exacting stan
dards. However, the release of BBC 
Sessions, a new two-CD record featur
ing some of the bands radio perfor
mances, should provide a better look at 
Led Zeppelins performing skills.
/\l Who: Led Zeppelin 
ctva What: ,,A SWrrpner
Company: Atlantic Records
The first CD of the set is comprised 
of songs recorded by the band for radio 
shows in 1969. The CD consists of 
early Zeppelin tunes and shows off the 
bands penchant for the blues. Guitar. ist Jimmy Page and vocalist Robert 
. Plant drive jam-oriented songs like 
You Shook Me. I Cant Quit You 
Baby clearly illustrates the influence 
blues had on the band.
In addition, the three versions of 
Communication Breakdown dem
onstrate the ability of the band to 
improvise and redefine their music, 
as each of the versions is quite differ
ent from the others. Some other high
lights of the CD include versions of 
Dazed and Confused and What Is 
and What Should Never Be, which 
remain faithful to the studio versions. 
While the disc overall is solid, the 
 songs sometimes lose focus and be
come less compelling.
The second CD in the set is a more 
intense and engaging work than the 
first. All of the songs are taken from a 
1971 BBC radio concert, and nearly 
every track betters its studio counter part. The band sets the tone early on,
with energetic versions of Immigration 
Song and Heartbreaker. From that 
point on, the band rips through several 
of its classics, adding depth and soul to 
the original. Since Ive Been Loving 
You and Black Dog both translate 
well to the live show. Bassist John Paul 
Jones and drummer John Bonham pro
pel the melodies efficiently, while Page 
and Plant ensure that both songs retain 
the epic sound that made them remark
able in the first place. Following a long 
(18:36), yet enticing, version of Dazed 
and Confused comes the bands bestknown work, Stairway to Heaven, 
which sounds more immediate and fresh 
than most new rock and roll. The band 
closes out the set strongly, by interject
ing covers of blues standards into Whole 
Lotta Love and finally, with a strong,

emotional reworking of Thank You. 
Those expecting to find new Zeppelin 
tracks on BBC Sessions may be disap
pointed  the album consists almost 
entirely of new versions of old songs. 
However, it allows the listener to gain 
an appreciation for the bands influ
ences as well as for its skill performing 
live. While at times it may seem ponder
ous, BBC Sessions is an excellent al
bum which perhaps contains more power 
and soul than any of Led Zeppelins 
studio releases.
Punk rock icon rants, amuses
By PAULLETTE POULLET
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Henry Rollins could kick my ass. 
Imposing, muscular, and tattooed, 
Rollins is best known for his work with 
Black Flag and Rollins Band, command
ing intense, hard-edged performances 
for fans. Although he created a scene 
through his music, Rollins has also had 
a long-standing career as a spokenword artist, releasing several albums 
and books of poetry in the past. CMU 
students, through the AB Lecture se
ries, welcomed Rollins for a spokenword performance in McConomy audi
torium last Wednesday.
Students expecting the same inten
sity and anger portrayed in his music 
were pleasantly surprised as Rollins 
monologue took off, sounding more like 
a comedy act than the expected rants. 
In a stream-of-consciousness fashion, 
Rollins spoke, among other things, of 
his family life, his frustration with 
hotel elevators, his crazy road man
ager, his days with Black Flag, and his 
travels around the world with Rollins 
Band. His anecdote about his Thai 
tour guide (named 74, as he would 
not allow anyone to address him by his 
real name) and other experiences in 
Thailand were particularly amusing. 
Other highlights included the reading 
of Rollins faxes to his rock n roll 
throat doctor, whose patients included 
Aerosmith, Ozzy Osbourne, and 
Michael Bolton. One of the faxes begged 
the doctor to accidentally cut Boltons 
vocal chords while performing a rou
tine checkup.
Rollins tone was fantastic, light enough 
to amuse the audience for the length of 
the performance (about two and a half 
hours), but earnest enough for us to un
derstand his thoughts and take them 
seriously. His set-in-stone opinions about 
violence, television, and education were 
evident and provoked further thought on 
the listeners behalf. His facility with 
words was clear and commanded respect 
for his opinions andlifestyle. Even though 
he had no set speech, Rollins perfor
mance left the audience satisfied, thought
ful, and amused.
As all alternative rock icons must 
do, Rollins preached lightly about his 
thoughts on college. According to him, 
slacker students should drop out and let 
less financially fortunate ones take their 
place, the twist to this philosophy being 
that the slacker students parents would 
pay the new students tuition, the price 
to pay for having a lazy child.
After the show, Rollins was gracious 
enough to welcome students waiting 
outside the Connan room to an auto
graph signing/chitchat session. Some 
kid, I hear, actually brought in his an
swering machine for Rollins to record a 
message on.
Henry Rollins could kick my ass. In
stead, he blew my mind away.

W until the present, some 15 billion years later.
In the beginning the Universe was a hot, formless soup 
of quarks and leptons, the fundamental constituents of matter.
ftOtO- ^ As the Universe cooled and expanded layer, upon layer of structure developed: I 
first quarks came together to form neutrons and protons; then neutrons and protons combined to I 
create the nuclei of the lightest elements; and finally atoms formed. The formation of large-scale I 
^Structurestars, galaxies, clusters of galaxies, superclusters and voidswas driven by gravity, which I 
4jw together these large concentrations of matter from very small, primeval inhomogeneities in the I 
matter distribution. The two great challenges in cosmology are the identification of the nature of the I 
ubiquitous dark matter that holds the Universe together and formulation of a detailed description of j 
how large-scale structure developed.
The most promising idea, known as the cold dark matter theory, asserts that the most of the k 
dark matter is comprised of elementary particles left over from the early fiery moments and t 
that the inhomogeneity that seeded the formation of structure originated during a very ^ 
early and very rapid period of expansion called inflation. Great efforts are being 
made to test the cold dark matter theory. Should it prove correct, our under
standing of the history of the Universe will be extended back almost to^ 
the moment of creation, and further, this understanding will shed^
^ j light upon the unification of the forces of nature.

Film defends novels validity
By TOM LIANZA
Tartan Staffwriter
In scanning the credits of The 
Rainmaker, there are two factors 
that stick out: one is that the film 
is directed by Francis Ford 
Coppola, director of such great 
films as The Godfather andApocalypse Now; the other is the fact 
that the movie is based on a book 
by John Grisham, his sixth novelturned-movie among a list of un
impressive films. I was hopeful 
that Coppola could turn 
Grishams losing streak around.
What: TPW .ipevi?Wh 
Director: Francis Ford 
Coppola
Company: Paramount 
Pictures/Constellation 
Films
The plot is similar to, but less 
controversial than, that of A Time 
to Kill. A young law school gradu
ate named Rudy Baylor (Matt 
Damon) joins a sleazy ambulancechasing law firm. He is taken un
der the wing of fellow employee 
Deck Shifflet (Danny DeVito), who 
shows him the ins and outs of a 
law firm and the legal system.
Together, Baylor and Shifflet 
take a case prosecuting Great 
Benefit Insurance Company. The 
company is accused of not follow
ing through with its agreed policy, 
resulting in the death of an in
sured leukemia patient. Bruiser 
Stone (Mickey Rourke), the head 
of the law firm for which Baylor 
and Shifflet work, starts getting 
wrapped up in criminal scandals. 
The firm goes under, and Baylor 
and Shifflet start their own firm 
in order to continue to prosecute 
Great Benefit.
I was very impressed that this 
film rose above your typical court
room drama. Each character in the 
courtroom was so well developed 
that the viewer could become en
thralled in the action.
In particular, Matt Damon did 
an excellent job with the role. His 
courtroom inexperience was believ
able  a refreshing change from 
other movies in which the young
lawyer is flawless and brilliant in 
his first attempt at winning a 
court case.
Danny DeVito also performed 
well. Deck Shifflet is a self-de
scribed paralawyer who failed 
the bar exam six times. This role; 
was perfect for DeVito, and he1 
was very likable throughout the 
film. Jon Voight played the quint
essential bad lawyer and did a 
fine job at breaking rules and 
being unlikable. His arrogance 
was anticipated and typical oi1 
courtroom-type movies, but none
theless, he did a good job.
It seemed like Damon was 
playing the same role that Mat
thew McConaughey did in A 
Time To Kill, but such similariJ 
ties can be attributed to the fact 
that John Grisham wrote thlei 
novels on which both films are 
based. The scenes in this movie 
were notably shorter than scenes 
in most movies nowadays, and 
the film was not at all drawn out. 
The style in which Coppola; di
rected this film keeps the viewer 
focused on the screen.

Set 200years after Commander 
Ellen Ripley dies in the process of 
killing the last queen alien, the

Jeunet (City of Lost Children, 
Delicatessen), combines the hightech special effects of the latest 
Hollywood films, while incorpo

previous Alien movies. We find 
many new ideas introduced into

of characters we are accustomed 
to seeing in Alien films, combines
What: Alien Resurrection 
Director: Jean-Pierre

Company: 20th Century

Sigourney Weaver as Ripley (center) leads the way into battle.
Although many aspects of the 
film seem a little too extreme for 
the amount of current knowledge 
we have about human genetics 
and cloning, the presentation is 
done in a clear and precise man
ner. At times, you will question
graphic visuals that could cause 
younger audiences to sleep un
easily. Unlike the Alien films of 
the past, we find fewer aliens 
presented to us.
While Alien 3 saw little charac
ter development, Alien Resurrecto strongly benefit the film as a 
whole. The high-tech world con
tains more of a plot as we see the 
U.S. government causing the alien 
breakout this time.
Sigourney Weaver continues 
to play Ripley, a strong masculine-type role with small out
breaks of femininity. Winona 
Ryder adds fresh new blood to 
the whole plot with her partial 
innocence and sweetness as th 
character Call. These two main 
characters, combined with an 
outstanding supporting cast, pror

With the strong disappoints

recommend that you do not let 
this deter you from watching this

It wouldnt be quite fair to say that Mid
night in the Garden of Good and Evil starts 
off on the right note  it starts off like a 
symphony. But watching Midnight is like 
listening to Beethovens Ninth deteriorate 
into Andrew Lloyd Webbers 346th.
I What: Midnight in the Garden of Good 
I and Evil
| Director: Clint Eastwood 
[Company: Warner Bros.
Our hero, John Kelso (John Cusack), is a 
magazine writer who finds himself in Sa
vannah, Georgia to work on a small story 
about a renowned Christmas party. But his 
two-day stay is extended when the host of 
that party, Jim Williams (Kevin Spacey), 
shoots and kills a local hustler (Jude Law). 
Kelso sees potential for a book in Williams 
story, whatever it turns out to be, and de
cides to stay in Savannah indefinitely..
This first half-hour of film is superbly 
constructed and directed by Clint Eastwood 
 characters are established, conflicts set 
up, and Savannah is introduced as a place 
populated by eccentrics: one man walks a 
leash without a dog, and another keeps 
houseflies as pets and strings them to his 
clothes. At the Christmas party, guests hold 
champagne glasses in one hand and pistols 
in the other.
At first, we share Kelsos fascination with 
Savannah, and we too want to know whats 
going on with Jim Williams, who claims to 
have shot the boy in self-defense. But the 
killing seems more complicated. Spacey, who
is magnificent, imbues in his character a kind 
of menace, a sinister suaveness, which assures 
you that Williams isnt telling the whole truth.
Given this start, the course Midnight takes 
over the next two hours is a massive disap
pointment. It becomes, essentially, a court
room drama, with occasional comic and bi
zarre twists, like Williams reliance on voodoo 
ritual to insure his acquittal. Here, the film 
comes to a screeching halt. Scenes drag, plot 
developments occur and are then unnecessar
ily recounted in court, long glances are ex
changed. Eastwoods direction becomes labored 
and slow.
Based on the 1994 
bestseller by John 
Berendt  a brilliant 
nonfiction novel which 
is more about the ec
centricities of Savan
nah, (of which Jim Wil
liams trial is only a 
part)the film version 
fails to do justice to the 
book because it gets so 
caught up in the court
room drama and in 
making our hero a part 
of that drama; he is 
eventually forced to 
withhold evidence 
which might change the 
outcome of the case. But 
no such Hollywood-ish 
moral dilemma occurs 
in the book. Berendt 
presents himself as an 
observer, but his screen 
incarnation, Kelso, is 
made to be a participant, and it doesnt ring true. Kelso becomes 
wishy-washy  is he going to write about 
these people or become one of them? The 
question is never answered.
The real crime comes in the form of 
Mandy Nichols (Alison Eastwood, the 
directors daughter) who serves as Kelsos 
love interest. It is tacked on, unnecessary, 
and you can just hear the pompous voice of 
the Hollywood executive who read Mid
night in the Garden of Good and Evil and 
said, This would make a great movie. All 
it needs is a love interest.
