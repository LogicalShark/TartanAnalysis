ATO loses on-campus housing
By FRANK MICHELS
Tartan Assistant News Editor
On Thursday, the University Com
mittee on Discipline (UDC) decided to 
remove housing privileges from the Al
pha Tau Omega (ATO) fraternity for one 
year, or until the fall semester of 1994. 
The fraternity will be forced to move out 
of its current location on the comer of 
Forbes Avenue and Morewood Avenue 
at the conclusion of the spring semester. 
On Sunday, ATO members held a pri
vate meeting, where they decided that 
they will appeal the decision to Presi
dent Robert Mehrabian before the ap>eal process expires in one week.
Actions taken against ATO are the 
removal of housing privileges for one 
year, a $250 fine, and a kind of death 
penalty to the fraternity, according to 
ATO President Chris Dee, a sophomore 
economics major. According to Dee, the 
decision came as result of ATO members 
throwing snowballs from their porch dur
ing the large snowfall in December, vio
lating a final warning.
The biggest feeling that I have is that 
it was not the [snowball] incident that 
pushed us over, but the prior incident 
that was our final warning, said Dee. 
According to Dee, ATO was given the 
final warning last November when a 
then-member of ATO had a conflict with 
a member from another fraternity on 
October 12. In retaliation, according to 
Dee, members of the other fraternity 
vandalized the ATO house. A member of
ATO notified Campus Police. Dee said 
that afterward, the vandals stood on 
ATOs porch, where they exchanged 
words with members of ATO. No fists 
were thrown, he said. Campus Police 
ordered ATO brothers to return inside.
The former member pleaded guilty to 
disorderly conduct in front of UDC be
cause of the fight, according to Dee. The 
fraternity as a whole was cleared of all 
charges except disorderly conduct, be
cause members of the other fraternity 
where on their porch, according to ATO 
brother Rich Smith, a junior materials 
science and engineering major.
As a result, ATO lost its ability to have 
pledges until the spring semester in 
1994. How can we create a fraternity 
withafuturewithoutpledges? Ourhands 
were tied, said Dee. ATO was also placed 
on extended disciplinary probation, fined 
$100, and given the final warning, 
according to Dee.
According to Smith, the other frater
nity was found guilty on charges of van
dalism, harassment, disorderly conduct, 
trespassing, reckless endangerment, and 
assault, as well as placed on extended 
probation and forced to do community 
service. They did not lose pledges; they 
did not get a warning, said Dee.
Dee calls the decision an injustice put 
on the Greek system. Dee said, A lot of 
people dont know the injustices put on 
the Greek system. I have one appeal, 
and hopefully, after some petitions go 
around, therell be some action. Accord
ing to Dee, in UDC, the Greek is guilty
until proven innocent.
Assistant to the Dean of Student Af
fairs Patricia Hamed, who is also the 
Greek advisor for Student Affairs, ex
plained the rationale of UDC. She said, 
We ask [UDC] to review incidents that 
occur on campus and decide if they are in 
violation of University policy... I believe 
that all of its decisions are fair. Michael 
Murphy, dean of Student Affairs, could 
not be reached for comment.
Interfratemity Council (IFC) Presi
dent Jody Lutz, a senior social and deci
sion sciences major and Sigma Tau 
Gamma brother, said, I dont like the 
fact that theyre getting kicked out. 
Whatever I could do, I will work with 
them. IFC House Chair Rich Marino, a 
junior mathematics member and Pi 
Lambda Phi member, said that he thinks 
the decision is a tragedy. He said, I 
am very upset about it, and it was a very 
harsh decision.
At Sundays meeting, ATO indicated 
that it has no plans to give up its charter, 
but it has one week to appeal the deci
sion to Warner Hall. ATO is launching 
a Save ATO campaign, where they will 
be calling ATOs national office, alumni, 
and other Greek organizations.
The last time that a fraternity was 
removed from housing was Zeta Beta 
Tau (ZBT), who lost its charter and was 
replaced by Kappa Delta Rho seven years 
ago, according to Marino. ZBT was ban
ished from campus when they were in
volved in a fight with members of the 
Korean Student Association.
CFA student dies in Sweden
By KENDRICK K. CHUA
Tartan News Editor
Hannah Lopez, junior art major, died on January 
30 in Stockholm, Sweden, in an ice skating acci
dent. She was 20.
According to Michael Murphy, dean of Student 
Affairs, Lopez was in Sweden by way of an ex
change program through Amherst College, and fell 
through a crack in the ice on the bay outside of her 
host home.
A release from the Petersen ODonnel Funeral 
home also lists dead in the accident Duncan Cra
ven, her boyfriend and former student at Univer
sity of California at Berkeley.
Lopez had a unique interest in art and artists of 
Eastern Europe, particularly those of the former 
Soviet Union, according to fam
ily and friends. Lopez was also a 
Resident Assistant and a mem
ber of what is now the womens 
soccer team.
A memorial service for Lopez 
was held in the CFA building at 
4:30 pm on Friday. Approxi
mately 50 people, students and 
faculty, came to the event. After 
several people deliveredpersonal 
eulogies, the group went to Flag
staff Hill in Schenley park where 
several dozen multicolored he
lium balloons tied to hand-writ
ten messages to Lopez were re
leased into the air.
Right now, I think were just 
missing her, said Elizabeth 
Lopez, Lopezs mother. Hannah 
was so full of life, so fearless, and 
so full of energy.... Hannah 
wanted to save the world. Were 
sad not to have her with us.
Kiplee Johnson, a friend and a
student at LaSalle College in Massachsetts, also 
expressed her feelings about Lopez. I think it is 
important to remember that she was a very viva
cious person, and she was always doing some
thing.
As time went on we all came to know Hannah, 
said Jodi Piccolo, junior industrial management 
student, a friend and teammate. Her carefree 
nature and friendliness 
were contagious.... We will 
all miss you Hannah.
Lopez is survived by her 
parents, a sister, a brother, 
and three grandparents.
Her funeral service was held 
this morning at 11 am in 
Topsfield, Massachusetts.
Senate introduces revised 
campus postering policy
By MIKE KEATING
Tartan Junior Staff writer
On Tuesday, February 2, a proposal was intro
duced in Student Senate that would make sig
nificant changes in the current poster policy. 
This proposal, in principle an effort to conserve 
paper, ensure equal access to bulletin boards, 
and curtail abuse of the boards, has caused 
controversy among large student organizations.
Proposed limitations include limitingeach cam
pus organization to one active poster per bulletin 
board, while keeping a poster size limit of 11 
inches by 17 inches. A system of monthly purges 
of out-of-date posters, and penalties for failure to 
comply with guidelines (including a minimum 
fine of $10 per poster) have also been proposed. 
As it currently stands, the policy would be en
forced by volunteers and students working for 
Student Activities, and enforcement would be 
funded by fines collected for violations. In special 
instances, the Office of Student Activities can 
make exceptions to the policy.
Representatives of service fraternity Alpha
Phi Omega (A Phi O) and Student Dormitory 
Council (SDC) have been outspoken in their 
opposition to the policy changes. A Phi O and 
SDC, both large campus organizations which 
sponsor many programs at once, are concerned 
that the new policy would unfairly restrict their 
advertising of events and programs.
CIT Senator Burt Holzman wrote the new 
policy as a part of his duties as chair of the 
Campus Affairs Committee. He began research
ing the policy changes last semester, working 
with the Academic Affairs Committee. Surveys 
were sent to all campus organizations asking for 
input on the proposed changes, but Holzman 
said that response was very low, indicative of 
general indifference. I acted on that, he said. 
The proposal was introduced to Senate during 
last Tuesdays meeting, and was tabled for one 
week so that campus organizations could be 
informed and given an opportunity to voice their 
concerns.
1991 graduate and A Phi O brother David 
Apfelbaum has voiced several arguments about

On February 1 Eric Grotzinger 
assumed the position of Associ
ate Dean for Undergraduate Af
fairs in Mellon College of Sci
ence, a new position in MCS.
Grotzinger is currently serving 
as associate head of biological 
sciences. Over the next few 
months the MCS undergraduate 
responsibilities of Robert Kail, 
associate dean for undergradu
ate affairs in MCS and Carnegie 
Institute of Technology, will shift 
to Grotzinger. Meanwhile, a con
current transition period will al
low for the hiring and training of 
a new associate head of biological 
sciences.
Grotzinger said that the posi
tion offers him the chance to have 
a broader influence on under
graduates throughout MCS. I 
really enjoy working with under
graduates. he said. He will be 
responsible for all biology, chem
istry, physics, and math under
graduates as well as computer 
science freshmen.
The new position was created 
as a result of a recommendation
by the Task Force for Under
graduate Advising, appointed by 
MCS Dean Susan Henry and 
chaired by Professor Dave Owen. 
In their final report which was 
submitted on October 29 of last 
year, the Task Force suggested a 
position be created to be respon
sible forpolicymaking and imple
mentation, direct student contact, 
liason, and advocacy outside 
MCS."
Due to the new CIT curriculum 
as well as the expanded MCS 
curriculum, students in both col
leges require more attention than 
they did when Kails position was 
originally instituted, accordingto 
the Task Force report.
Considering that approxi
mately 2000 students are enrolled 
in either MCS or CIT, it was de
cided that this individual atten
tion could be better granted if a 
new staff position were instituted. 
Therefore, the Task Force sug
gested the responsibility of ad
vising be distributed between two 
deans, each advising students of 
a single college.
With the Task Force recom
mendation in mind, Henry and 
CIT Dean Steve Director, ap
proached Provost Paul Christiano 
to ask for the resources to insti
tute the new associate dean posi
tion. With Christianos support 
the position became a reality, and 
a search committee was organized 
to find an individual to assume 
the position of associate dean for 
undergraduate affairs.
At this point, Kail distributed a 
letter to all MCS faculty inquir
ing if anyone was interested in 
the position. A few faculty mem
bers expressed such an interest; 
however, Grotzinger wastheonly 
one to submit a complete applica
tion.
Chemistry senior Tara 
Haughton served on the search 
committee alongside Kail, Biol
ogy Department representative 
Alan Koretsky and Math/Com
puter Science Department repre
sentative Mark Stehlik. I per
sonally feel that Eric is the best 
person in the world for this job, 
Haughton said. He has a genu
ine interest in the students of 
CMU.Henry agreed, citingGrotzingers commitment and success 
in advising biology undergradu
ates. She noted the distributive

Clinton selects Attorney General
WASHINGTON, February 5 (DJ)  
President Bill Clinton has chosen Fed
eral Judge Kimba Wood of New York as 
his nominee for attorney general, The 
Wall Street Journal reported.
Wood has been a federal district judge 
since 1988 and is best known for presid
ing over the securities fraud case of 
junk-bond king Michael Milken.
As the new nominee for attorney gen
eral, she replaces corporate lawyer Zoe 
Baird, who withdrew her name from 
consideration after disclosing that she 
had hired illegal aliens and didnt pay 
their Social Security taxes.
Wood received criticism in the past for 
giving Milken a harsh, 10-year sentence, 
and then later reducing it to what some 
thought was a too lenient, two-year sen
tence after Milken cooperated exten
sively with prosecutors. But Clinton is 
believed to feel that both decisions were 
solid and easily defensible.
Yesterday, the White House asked the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation to check
into Woods record. An announcement 
about her nomination is expected soon.
The selection of Wood is expected to 
please womens groups, which were cam
paigning hard for Clinton to name an
other woman to the high-ranking cabi
net post. But Clinton also considered 
men for the job, and the FBI had been 
asked last Friday to check into the back
ground of Washington lawyer Charles 
Ruff.
Wood, a moderate Democrat, was ap
pointed to the bench by PresidentRonald 
Reagan. She has been praised for han
dling a long series of complicated cakes 
like Milkens efficiently and without 
being overturned by higher courts.
She knows quite a lot about how to 
manage, said Harvard Law School pro
fessor Lawrence Tribe, who was hired 
by Milkens team as a consultant. I was 
extremely impressed.
Prior to her service in Manhattans 
federal court she was a well-regarded 
corporate litigator with the law firm
LeBoeuf, Lamb, Leiby & MacRae, spe
cializing in antitrust law.
She also worked briefly for the Legal 
Services Corporation. She is the mother 
of a young child and the wife of Time 
magazine political correspondent 
Michael Kramer.
At LeBouef Lamb, she represented 
the underwriters Lloyds of London, one 
of LeBoeuf Lambs major insurance cli
ents, and St. Regis Corp., a paper com
pany that was the target of several muchtalked-about antitrust suits in the late 
1970s.
Wood, as attorney general, would have 
a direct say in the way the Clinton ad
ministration treats Haitian refugees 
seeking political asylum.
Wood was educated at Connecticut 
College, the Sorbonne at the University 
of Paris, the London School of Econom
ics, and the Harvard Law School. She 
has been active with the antitrust sec
tion of the American Bar Association 
and the American Law Institute.
Clinton to cancel space station, supercollider
WASHINGTON, February 5 (AP) 
Congressional sources said that the 
Clinton administration is considering 
a budget plan that would cancel two of 
the nations largest science projects, 
the Bpace station and the supercon
ducting supercollider.
The space station, expected to cost 
about $30 billion, and the supercollider, 
a $8.2 billion effort, are considered 
prime targets for Clintons budgetary 
efforts, the sources said.
Acongressional aide said that Clinton 
administration officials first proposed 
cutting the projects during budget dis
cussions at a gathering of White House 
and Cabinet officers during a weekend 
retreat at Camp David, Maryland.
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, 
a former Texas senator, is said to have 
objected strongly to killing the super
conducting supercollider, a project 
that is being built south of Dallas, 
Texas.
NASA has been working on the space 
station, to be called Freedom, for sev
eral years and has already spent about 
$8 billion on design and testing of 
concepts.
The station has met heavy objec
tions in Congress in the past years 
and has had to undergo at least one 
major redesign.
There may not be strong support for 
the projects among Clintons Cabinet. 
Energy Secretary Hazel OLeary said 
in an interview she does not feel 
passionately about the supercollider 
atom smasher project.
This issue becomes: Can we afford 
this?  she said in her first meeting 
with reporters.
Courts, community prepare for new Rodney King trial
LOS ANGELES, February 2 
(DJ)  Jury selection began on 
Wednesday in the federal trial of 
four police officers accused of beat
ing Rodney King. Next month 
state prosecutors are scheduled 
to start trying the first four men 
charged with attacking trucker 
Reginald Denny.
To many observers, the U.S. 
attorney prosecuting the King 
case already appears to be facing 
tougher legal hurdles than the 
district attorney, rai6ingconcems 
that the white officers will be 
acquitted and the black alleged 
rioters will be convicted on the 
toughest charges in the widely 
televised beating of Denny.
Local leaders and residents of 
troubled neighborhoods are brac
ing themselves against that pos
sibility and probable ensuing ri
oting, The Wall Street Journal 
reported.
Our fingers are on the pulse of 
the community, and its an anx
ious one," says Julius C. Butler, a 
spokesman for the First A.M.E. 
Church in South Central Los 
Angelos. Ministersandothercivic 
leaders plan to hold meetings 
during the trials in an effort to 
avoid the fire next time. In 
Koreatown, one of the areas hit 
hardest by rioting last year, 
Daniel Oh says his neighbors have 
bought guns, window bars, and 
rolldown metal doors. Were 
ready this time," says the general 
manager of Ham Hung restau
rant. Mayor Tom Bradley allo
cated $300,000 to hire 23 com
munity organizers to walk doorto-door and distribute weekly 
leaflets as the cases progress.
Still, if the first trial results in 
not-guilty verdicts and the 
Denny-related casesendintough 
convictions, an appeal to people 
to be nice will fall on deaf ears, 
says John Mack, president of the
tent requirement. Some legal 
experts say that prosecutors best 
hope is that the jury misunder
stands directions and simply as
sumes that if excessive force was 
used, the officers meant it to be. 
Everyone agrees thattechnically 
speaking, the federal prosecutors 
have more to prove, as a matter of 
law, than the state prosecutors, 
says Peter Arenella, a professor
Our fingers are on the pulse of the 
community; and it's an anxious one.

In the federal case, Justice De
partment lawyers are contend
ing that the officers violated 
Kings civil rights  specifically, 
his Fourth Amendment right to 
be safe from unreasonable force 
during arrest. To prevail, the gov
ernment must show not only that 
the police used more force than 
necessary, but also that it was 
their conscious objective to do so. 
Prosecutors in the state trial last 
year couldnt even prove the first 
element and didnt have to prove 
the second.
Federal civil rights cases have 
traditionally been difficult for the 
government because of the in
of law at the University of Cali
fornia, Los Angeles. Whats in 
dispute is whether or not the in
tent requirement will make a real 
difference.
In the upcoming trial, prosecu
tors are expected to call King to 
testify, a risky move since his 
criminal past might undermine 
his credibility. He did not appear 
as a witness last year.
Last month, Judge John G. 
Davies, in a major reversal of his 
earlier views, agreed with pros
ecutors that they dont have to 
prove the officers intent was 
rooted in racism. Government 
lawyers had said in court that the 
indictment didnt allege a racial
motive and that they werent pre
pared to prove beyond a reason
able doubt that the officers beat 
King because he is an African 
American. Police computer mes
sages containing racist comments 
were deemed inadmissible be
cause they didnt directly refer to 
the beating.
Under the new ruling, prosecu
tors can succeed if they prove 
intent arose for any reason, such 
as anger over the motorists be
havior.
But in a setback for the govern
ment, prosecutors conceded that 
jurors in the federal trial 
shouldnt be allowed to hear a 
portion of testimony given by one 
of the officers, Theodore Briseno, 
in last years case.
Defense lawyers had argued 
that Briseno, the only officer to 
break ranks with his colleagues 
in the earlier trial, improperly 
drew conclusions about what they 
were thinking. If convicted, the 
officers could be sentenced to 10 
years in prison. However, since 
the government alleged no lesser 
charges, a not-guilty verdict 
means the officers will go free. 
This is all or nothing, says a 
spokeswoman for the U.S. attor
ney in Los Angeles.
In the Denny-related cases, as 
in the officers coming trial, the 
basic facts arent in dispute. Tele
vision cameras saw to that. The 
dispute hinges instead on the elu
sive question of the defendants
state of mind. Three of the men, 
scheduled for trial beginning 
March 15, are accused of at
tempted murder. They face a pos
sible sentence of life in prison. A 
fourth, whose trialis setfor March
1, is charged with robbery. A to
tal of seven men were arrested in 
connection with the attacks at 
the Los Angeles intersection 
where Denny was beaten.
Defense lawyers for the three 
contend their clients werent try
ing to kill Denny. Generally, you 
had a spontaneous, chaotic series 
of events, says Wilma Shanks, 
an attorney for Damian William s. 
For an attempted murder con
viction, you have to show plan
ning and deliberation. Williams 
and the others could be convicted 
on lesser charges, such as as
sault.
The so-called Denny defendants 
have attracted an increasingly 
visible group of supporters, who 
arrive at pre-trial hearings with 
buttons proclaiming Free the 
L.A. Four Plus, a reference to 
the first four men arrested and 
the additional defendants. A rally 
two months ago became violent 
and was quickly suppressed by 
police.
Los Angeles District Attorney 
Gil Garcetti, who indicated dur
ing his campaign for the job last 
fall that he might consider a plea 
bargain for some of the Denny 
defendants, has since dismissed 
gang-related charges.

MCS deans appointed
jTg:r 10n- tvPe s
mentoring program for which he 
was responsible. This program al
lows a greater number of faculty to 
become involved in student advis
ing on a one-on-one basis.
The MCS Task Force on Curricu
lum, headed by professor Robert 
Swendsen, was created in early De
cember 1992. Its purpose will be to 
evaluate and reorganize under
graduate education in MCS.
Swendsen has also recently ac
cepted the position of associate dean 
for faculty and graduate affairs in 
MCS, replacing Juan Schaffer.
Finally, Student Advisory Coun
cils (SAC) have been instituted for 
the dean and asscociate deans in 
MCS. Additionally, SACs already 
exist in each department in MCS. 
The SACs were created to provide 
direct student input to MCS faculty. 
Its very important to us that stu
dents feel that they have direct ac
cess to the deans and all of the 
resources we can provide, said 
Henry. SACs meet about once every 
two weeks. Henry also encouraged 
MCS students who have any ques
tions or concerns to make an ap
pointment with either her or 
Grotzinger, to communicate by email, or to talk to one of the SAC 
members. Areception for Grotzinger 
and Swendsen is tenatively sched
uled for early March.
Senate introduces revised postering policy
8Ch/Tar 10n- tvPe s
the proposed policy. I think that its 
going to have a very positive efect. How
ever, I think that that one rule will 
cripple organizations such as A Phi O, 
AB Tech, SDC, and so forth, said 
Apfelbaum, who also said that A Phi 0 
relies on its advertising to find students 
that are in need of its services, such as 
Magic Bus. There have been problems 
where a lack of student awareness has 
driven up costs of A Phi Os projects, said 
Apfelbaum.
The new poster policy, if passed in its 
current form, would require A Phi 0 to 
condense its advertising of several events 
to one poster.
Apfelbaum said that condensing in
formation onto one poster would further 
limit the response to A Phi Os pro
grams, and threaten the fraternitys ex
istence. This would be very, very bad 
for A Phi O, he says.
A Phi O brother and Senate Human 
Resources Committee Chair Ann 
Kopchik is also concerned. I see why 
[the poster policy] is being revised, and 
I see why we have one.... I guess Im 
concerned with the one poster per orga
nization per board restriction.
During their meeting on February 3, 
SDC voted unanimously to condemn the 
poster policy. SDC executive board mem
ber Chris Stengel said that in trying to 
conserve paper, in the end [Senate is] 
just screwingthe big organizations. Like 
Apfelbaum, Stengel said that the limita
tion of one poster per organization per 
bulletin board will make advertising 
completely ineffective.
SDC is an organization which often
sponsors more than one event at a time, 
such as booth and buggy meetings and 
other programs. Stengel said that Sen
ate was overstepping its bounds. He 
said he believed that that the problem 
stems from the complicated interaction 
of Senate and SDC jurisdictions. SDC, 
operating under Housing, gets no fund
ing from Student Senate, and is in no 
way under Senate jurisdiction save for 
the restrictions Senate can place on bul
letin boards. If the new poster restric
tions are passed, Stengel said, Senate 
will be dictating how many events we 
can have.
One of the main advocates of a strong 
poster policy, H&SS Senator Josh 
Knauer, said, It is important that we 
have a strong poster policy, and that the 
policy is strongly enforced. If not, it be
comes just another piece of paper. 
Knauer originally favored the strongest 
limitations the poster policy proposed, 
but has since modified his position.
It is now highly likely that he or an
other senator will propose an amend
ment to the policy when it comes to the 
floor at the next Senate meeting, lessen
ing the restrictions on postering to allow 
one poster per event per bulletin board 
with a maximum of three posters per 
organization per board, rather than one 
poster per organization per board, ac
cording to Knauer. This version of the 
policy is more favorable to some, but is 
still opposed by some in SDC and A Phi
O. Kopchik said, I prefer not to have the 
limit of three posters per board. Not 
many organizations have more than 
three events per week, so I dont see 
much of a problem.
Senate legislation #93S-11
Carnegie Mellon University Poster Policy 
to take effect on_________
In order to more effectively communi
cate when events and programs are 
happening on campus, the following 
poster policy has been established. The 
Intent of this policy Is to curtail abuse 
and ensure that everyone has equal 
access to the bulletin boards.
An active poster is defined as a poster 
that either lists an event which has not 
yet occurred, or with no effective event 
date.
A bulletin board location is defined as 
any bulletin board or set of adjacent 
bulletin boards.
Postering guidelines are as follows:
1. Notices posted on bulletin board 
locations shall not exceed 11 x 17 inches 
In size.
2. The name of the sponsoring organi
zation must be clearly indicated on the 
poster.
3. Only one active poster per organiza
tion per bulletin board location is permit
ted.
4. Postering is allowed only on bulletin 
board locations and designated postering 
areas. Posters hangingrandomlyon walls 
and windows are not permitted.
5. Postering over other active posters 
Is not permitted.
6. Active posters hung by other organi
zations shall not be removed.
7. Those who want their poster to 
appear on the bulletin board location In 
Sklbo Grey Matter shall submit two post
ers per event to the Information Desk. 
This board Is maintained by Student 
Activities and only posters submitted to 
the Desk will be displayed; all others will 
be removed.
8. Banners hung outside of buildings 
shall be removed within 48 hours after 
the announced event.
9. Banners and other posters shall not 
be posted on the glass above the main 
entrances to Doherty and Baker Halls.
A monthly purge of the bulletin board 
locations on the first of every month will 
remove any posters whose dates have 
passed, any active posters with no effec
tive event date, and any posters that 
advertise events more than one month 
In advance.
Any exception to these guidelines will 
be made solely by the Office of Student 
Activities. Failure to comply with these 
guidelines will result in a minimum $10 
fine for each poster or banner improperly 
posted. In addition, if banners are not 
removed, organizations will be charged 
with removal costs.
If fines are not paid within 30 days the 
organization will not be permitted to use 
the bulletin board locations for the fol
lowing, academic semester. Any fines 
collected will be used to offset the cost 
of this program.

Architectural integrity 
lost with ceiling panel
The College of Fine Arts build
ing is definitely one of the finer 
structures on CMUs campus, 
especially considering the cur
rent state of the campus. In the 
midst of mud and construction 
I mayhem stands CFA, a re
minder of the original aesthetic 
and architecturally sound de
sign of the campus. And even 
though the niches are covered, 
there is an understanding that 
progress is being made and 
i someday the job will be com; pleted and will add even more to 
I this building.
| CFA has withstood the years 
| and many Beaux Arts balls fairly 
i well, taking into account the 
j number of students who have 
\ used (and sometimes abused)
; its halls, but last weekend one of 
I the panels that decorate the ceil; ing of the lobby fell and subse! quently disappeared. This panel 
; bears the CIT seal and the in! scription of Andrew Carnegies 
; motto,MyHeartisin the Work, 
i a saying familiar to CMU stuj dents. The CFA Deans Office 
j sent out an appeal for the return 
! of the panel to no avail.
| Anyone who has entered 
I through the lobby of CFA must 
; have looked up at the ceiling at 
! least one time, probably more.
; Though it is not the Sistine 
! Chapel, the painted panels de; pict a history that is part of the 
j tradition of the University. The 
1 phrase, My Heart is in the 
; Work, on the lost panel not only 
! embodies the spirit of the old 
| CIT, but also the spirit of CFA
as it exists today. CFA is the 
artistic center of CMU, and that 
is reflected in the building it
self.
Unfortunately, last weekend 
was a Sleeping Bag Weekend 
and there were also high school 
students in and out of CFA for 
portfolio reviews. There exists 
the possibility that one of these 
visitors removed the panel with
out being aware of the cost to 
the architectural integrity of 
the building. It is possible that 
the panel is far from here now. 
But there is also the chance 
that some member of the cam
pus community knows some
thing about this panel and could 
bring about its return.
It is ironic that an irreplace
able part of the one building on 
campus that has remained es
sentially the same over time 
has disappeared. CFA is the 
only one of the original build
ings which has not been sub
stantially changed, except for 
the completion of the niches. 
Baker, Doherty, and Margaret 
Morrison must look very differ
ent now on the inside than they 
did originally, but the first floor 
of CFA looks very much the 
same  except for the glaring 
empty space on the ceiling 
where the CIT panel was.
If anyone knows anything 
about the missing panel, please 
contact the CFA Deans Office 
or any of the CFA department 
offices. There will be no repri
mand. Theyjust want the panel 
back.Relocation requires 
planning, foresight
| As all students are aware, the 
I demolition ofSkibo is scheduled 
; to begin sometime in the near 
I future, though no definite date 
;has been set. In preparation for 
: this, the University has acquired 
the Naval Reserve building on 
IForbes and plans to relocate 
;many student organizations and 
services there. The questions 
(organizations are asking are, 
When? How? And what do we 
do in the meantime?
; The answer is that no one 
knows. And while ignorance may 
fee bliss, its also poor planning. 
The administration does not 
know when the Navy is plan
ting to vacate the building, and 
lienee cannot tell students when 
they can move in. While Warner 
Hall promises a move sometime 
over this summer, no one can 
guarantee it. Any kind of guar
antee seems especially unbeliev
able in light of rumors circulat
ing that the Navy has no plans 
to move to its new site in North 
Versailles before August 23. 
With classes beginning not long 
after that, it doesnt seem as 
though there will be much sum
mer left for organizations to 
move. Further complicating the 
whole process is the status of 
the last big donation that re
mains to be acquired before the 
University Center can be built.
' In order for the administra
tion to save itself and student 
prganizations from a headache, 
the variables must be nailed 
flown in advance. The adminisCFAsAtud Cen

tration must find out exactly 
when the Navy plans to vacate 
the premises, when the final 
donation will be given, decide 
whether or not the demolition of 
Skibo will begin regardless of 
the status of that donation, and 
decide when space allocations 
within the Naval Reserve build
ing will be announced.
As soon as all these variables 
have been sorted out and deci
sions have been made, the ad
ministration must inform the 
affected student groups with a 
detailed and finalized relocation 
schedule. Warner Hall should 
have a list of contact people who 
will be available over the sum
mer from each organization. It 
would be a shame if the admin
istration was to wait until sum
mer since organizations must 
have these answers soon.
Meanwhile, while organiza
tions are waiting for the big 
move, Skibo is falling down 
around their ears. For example, 
repairs are not being made, on 
the premise that Skibo is going 
to be demolished soon. Its like 
not bandaging a wound for a 
terminally ill patient because 
the patients just going to die 
anyway. Its bad enough that 
students have had to put up with 
Skibos poor design for a decade 
longer than first promised. 
Working in a building thats fall
ing apart, with no concrete 
knowledge of when the move will 
occur, is too much for the 
adminstration to ask.
Senate Chair offended 
by The Tartans editorial
Editor:
It comes as no sur
prise that in an issue
with a Corrections Letter to
section as long as many fhg FriitOf 
articles that one would 
find such craziness as one does in the 
editorial concerning Senates impound
ment of student organizations equip
ment [Groups remain innocent until 
proven guilty, 2/1]. While it is true that 
this power has been granted, the falla
cies spouted were unnecessary, and the 
propagation of your paranoia 8K the most 
detrimental of the devices at work.
Freezing a budget line is not punitive. 
Indeed, this is a necessary action to 
prevent money from being spent inap
propriately. In both of the cited cases, 
funds were unfrozen in a timely man
ner. In the case of The Thistle, it was 
little more than a day. Without such an 
ability to investigate concerns and to 
prevent improper actions, there is im
mense probability of irreparable dam
age being done to the student body.
Equipment is purchased by student 
organizations to use in the best interest 
of the student body. In order to fulfill 
their need, the group may need to pro
vide some of the money through dues or 
outside fund raising. Does this mean 
that the equipment is solely the prop
erty of the group? Hardly! It is still to be 
used for the student body. If this group 
violates Fiscal Policy so severely that it 
warrants impoundment of equipment 
pending an investigation then that 
should be done, especially if the student 
body stands to lose the equipment. For 
instance, what if the editors of The Tar
tan suddenly decided to sell its vast 
arsenal of computers? Those computers 
belong to the student body, of which The 
Tartan is a division. This would also be 
a violation of Fiscal Policy. But unless 
we could impound that equipment, we 
could not prevent the sale from taking 
place.
The Tartan would like you to believe 
that Student Senate is an evil entity 
bent on increasing its inventory of com
puters, buggies, and office supplies. I am 
a member of several student organiza
tions. I have little fear of Senates pow
ers. What I find downright frightening 
is the uncontrolled and uneducated voice 
of The Tartan.
Gregory A. Haverkamp 
Chair, Student Senate 
Junior, Industrial Management
Student concerned 
about editorial example
not consider whether clubs should have 
the power to ignore regulations instead 
of elected representatives having the 
power to enforce them. Without the pow
ers that Senate and the F&R Chair now 
hold, there could not be reliable enforce
ment. Equipment would disappear qui
etly at the first hint of an investigation.
However, to support its position that 
Senate is a hairy slavering monster, the 
Editorial Board cites a case where F&R 
acted upon the word of a member of 
the [cycling] club who also happened to 
be a Senator.
I was this member, and here is some 
context. This word was in fact an email 
dialogue with an officer of the Cycling 
Club. I sent this word to the entire 
F&R membership, without additional 
comment. Based on this word, F&R 
voted to freeze funds pending an inves
tigation of apparent malfeasance. The 
matter was duly resolved and the funds 
thawed.
I suppose this example was meant to 
illustrate abuse of power. But it seems 
clear that F&R acted responsibly and 
with probable cause. And as for my own 
role, I had none other than as plaintiff. 
Elected representatives do not relinquish 
their rights, as members of the student 
body, to fair treatment from clubs. More
over, it strikes me as wrong-headed to 
ask someone to ignore malfeasance, par
ticularly when that person, as a member 
of government, knows what legal proce
dures are available and how to initiate 
them.
An administrator I respect once ob
served that theres some amount of sheer 
stupidity that people have to work out of 
their systems while in college. I keep 
hoping that the Editorial Board will 
curb its tendency to be fatuous and wan
ton, but I suppose its in vain.

Campus Police ticketing 
putting students at risk
Editor:
Some things dont 
change. Tartan edito
rials are as whimsical Letter to
asrT\ v the EditorIn last week s edito
rial [Groups remain innocent until 
proven guilty, 2/1], the Editorial Board 
argues that Senate should not have the 
power to intervene upon probable cause 
to protect student body property. The 
worry seems to be that the Senate mon
ster will now tear into innocent student 
groups, grinning as their lifeblood drips 
from its new fangs.
The Editorial Board apparently did
time to ticket all the lots every hour or 
so, but they dont have time to protect a 
student who needs safe passage to a car 
parked, of necessity, halfway across cam
pus.
Ive suggested to Campus Police that 
they not ticket after hours. Their pri
mary objection seems to be that people 
park their cars overnight in these lots 
and deprive people with permits of their 
parking spaces in the morning. Ive sug
gested they ticket earlier in the morn
ing, say about 6 am  not that many 
people come in that early  or that they 
put up signs and tow illegally parked 
vehicles in the morning. My suggestions 
seemed to fall on deaf ears. Its nice of 
the Campus Police to be concerned about 
our safety, to warn us with posters about 
recently committed crimes and how we 
can help prevent them, but wouldnt it 
be nicer if they would remove the ob
stacles to our safety that they them
selves have placed upon us due to park
ing policies ? Isnt that the whole point of 
campus security?
There is not much more I can do to feel 
safer driving to campus at night. Ive 
already gotten several parking tickets 
because Id rather pay a $30 ticket than 
become a crime statistic. The point is, I 
should not have to worry. Campus Secu
rity is not making me feel very secure.

ing many late night workers face unnec

It used to be that you could park any

parked after hours in an empty, unused, 
permit lot like the one outside of CFA. 
As an architect, I spend a lot of time at 
night in the CFA studios, and especially 
given the proximity of recent crimes 
(like the rape behind GSIA), Id prefer to 
park as close to the buildings entrance 
as possible. But, of late, Ive been forced 
to park either on Tech Street or Frew 
Street (neither of which is well lit), in 
Tech Garage and walk alone across cam
pus in the early morning hours, or risk 
getting a ticket by parking in a safer and 
closer location such as CFA.
Ive thought about calling Campus 
Police to escort me on this walk, but

Student group supports 
proposed poster policy

Editor: 0%
This Tuesday a pro
posal was brought be
fore Student Senate to 
change the current 
poster policy such that 
the number of posters across campus 
would be reduced by approximately 213. 
By limiting the number of posters pr 
bulletin board to one for each advertised 
activity, paper consumption can be 
greatly reduced. With the current environmental situation, it is imperative that 
we alter our methods and learn to use 
our resources in the most effective way 
possible. It seems ridiculous to have a 
poster policy that permits three posters 
per bulletin board. This results in exces
sive waste of paper and inefficient use o> 
space, as the same information can be

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  8 February 19935
Poster policy needs work to be effective
Christian M. Restifo
Last week, the Campus Affairs 
(CA) Committee of Student Sen
ate presented a proposed poster 
policy that would reduce the 
amount of postering on campus 
and prevent organizations from 
postering over other organiza
tions advertisements. CA pro
vided us with a much needed 
policy, but a few minor adjust
ments are in order.
The current policy states that 
students shall post no more than 
one poster per organization per 
bulletin board. Each poster may 
be no larger than 11x17 inches, 
and the name of the sponsoring 
organization must be readily vis
ible on the poster. Groups may 
not poster over the active post
ers of others, active being defined 
as an event that has not yet oc
curred.
Bulletin boards would be 
purged once a month, and penal
ties would be assessed at the rate 
of $10 per violation. Those who 
failed to pay fines within 30 days 
would be prohibited from 
postering for the next academic 
semester. The desired result of 
this policy would be the reduc
tion of useless clutter and the fair
access to bulletin boards for all 
people.
Although this policy may sound 
good at first, many problems re
sult when the policy is really ex
amined. Members from SDC and 
A Phi 0 have voiced strong oppo
sition, noting that some organi
zations may have several events 
going on at one time. With only 
one poster per organization avail
able to them, groups would have 
to put all types of activities on 
one piece of paper. Two events 
could easily fit on one 11x17 
poster, but imagine a group like 
A Phi 0 that could have several 
occurring at one time.
Logistical problems also occur. 
Sometimes groups dont acquire 
necessary information until the 
last moment. If a poster with an
other event by the same group 
has already been posted, the other 
event is out of luck. Members will 
have to compile the information 
about the two events into a single 
new poster, get it printed up, and 
poster it. Otherwise, they will 
face fines.
I was originally in favor of the 
proposed policy because of the 
exemption clause. Basically, any 
organization could go to Student 
Activities and ask for more than, 
one poster per board for certain 
events. Whats the hassle, I 
thought? Why not just plan ahead 
to avoid things like this? Besides, 
if something occurs weekly, such 
as the AB Films on Thursday,
Friday, and Sunday, an auto
matic exemption could be 
granted.
After the response generated 
on the assocs. student-senate bul
letin board, however, I decided to 
reverse my position. SDC vited
Such a policy would reduce the 
needless multiple postings per 
bulletin board and still allow or
ganizations to effectively adver
tise concurrent events. Senate 
can prove that its willing to lis
ten to constituents by altering
When a group such as SDC, which, in

unanimously to oppose the policy. 
When a group such as SDC, 
which, in my opinion, usually does 
more than Senate for more people 
on this campus, opposes it, its 
time for people to listen and lis
ten hard.
H&SS Senator Joshua Knauer, 
who was originally in strong sup
port of the current proposed 
policy, capitulated and said he 
would motion to change the policy 
to read one poster per event per 
bulletin board. Additionally, each 
organization would be allowed a 
maximum of three posters per 
bulletin board. This is a step in 
the right direction, but it is not 
enough.
The current policy must be 
amended to read one poster per 
event per bulletin boat'd. Period.
the policy to bring it into line 
with their desires. CA chair Burt 
Holzman has been very willing to 
work with people on this issue, 
and I urge those concerned to 
talk to him.
Several questions still remain, 
however, and they must be dealt 
with in order to create a truly fair 
and effective policy. For example, 
do the posters of regular students 
fall under this policy? According 
to Holzman, students do fall un
der this policy, but they cannot be 
fined at this point. Is this fair to 
everyone?
What about non-recognized 
groups or organizations from off 
campus? I would have no prob
lem if those obnoxious Desert 
Flower or credit card things are 
tom down, but will they be fined?
If we are truly an open campus, 
will we allow them to stay up? 
How will they bo made aware of 
the policy?
The effectiveness of enforce
ment will also affect the quality 
of the policy. The current policy 
mentions that bulletin boards will 
be purged once a month. Thats 
hardly worth the effort. Ive heard 
that a combination of work study 
students and volunteers will en
force the rules, but we all know 
how long the use of volunteers 
will last.
With these questions, I do not 
mean to belittle the policy. I feel 
it has potential and should be 
worked on. I merely wish to en
sure that these issues are exam
ined. If anyone has problems with 
this policy, I strongly encourage 
them to speak to CA or to attend 
the Senate meeting this Tuesday 
in the Wherrett Room at 7 pm.

Having edited the stories on the deaths 
of four Cameige Mellon students, I find 
my thoughts on mortality growing more 
and more personal. Religion and fear of 
the unknown aside, I wonder what waits 
for me when I die.
I dont worry too much about the possi
bility of an afterlife since nobody who still 
remains on a physical earth can know or 
truly care. What I do worry about is what 
I will leave behind. In what way will I be 
immortalized here on Earth? In what ca
pacity will the person that I am now 
continue to live when my soul has passed 
on?
With the great tool of mass media at our 
disposal, some people would no doubt like 
to be a great and versatile actor. I suppose 
its everyones great fantasy to compose 
some piece of music that will live on in the 
memories of human beings forever, like a 
national anthem or a Christmas carol. Or 
to be the inventor of some revolutionary 
machine, having ones name permanently 
written in the science textbooks, being 
mispronounced by small schoolchildren. 
Or to be some great military leader, in 
league with Westmoreland and Nelson 
and Joan d Arc.
Unfortunately for me, being unmarketably Asian keeps me from being a 
rock star, even if I do have long hair. Lack 
of the discipline or the talent for dedicated 
research keeps me from any great scien
tific achievement. And flat feet and 
amblyopia kept me from even considering 
applying to West Point or for any reserve 
officers program. So it seems that as far 
as the rest of the world is concerned, some 
ungrateful children, unpaid bills, and a 
large stone may be all I am capable of 
leaving behind.
But only if you examine a very narrow 
frame of reference. Were I to sit in my 
dorm room at all hours of the day chanting 
mantras, would I truly be able to say that 
I will not leave any part of myself behind? 
Every bit of my work in everything I do 
affects the world in some way, even if no 
one notices, because I am aware of what I 
have done and what the consequences 
are. I leave my tracks, and that trail is
permanent and unmoving, even if unno
ticed or deliberately ignored.
I may only be a member of the company 
in that stage play, but that play will look 
and move differently if Im not on it. I may 
only be a voice in a great chorus, but that 
chorus will sound differently if I stop sing
ing. Your only job in that lab may be to 
feed the mice, but the research will lose 
credibility if those mice arent healthy. 
And your action as one of many enlisted 
men may affect the decisions of great 
leaders continents away.
I havent lived long enough in this life to 
even begin to deserve the wisdom to preach 
the value of life. But I think I can begin to 
see now why we have memorials for people 
other than leaders, and why we remember 
people who may not be world-famous. The 
world in which any one person lives is a 
complete world of experiences shared. 
When anyone dies, an entire world is lost.

Letters to the Editor
LETTERS, from page 4
conveyed in one poster as it can 
in three.
Hopefully if this proposal is 
passed a trend towards reduced 
paper consumption and waste 
throughout campus will be initi
ated. We eagerly support any 
changes that would accomplish 
this transition and will be work
ing on enforcing more efficient 
and environmentally sound pa
per consumption on campus. Sup
port and assistance from the cam
pus community is necessary to 
make these changes happen more 
smoothly. Any comments, advice 
or help would be greatly appreci
ated. Lets try to make a change!

Columnist disagrees 
over deportations
o%Editor:
In her letter 
to the editor
[Israel un- Letter tO 
fairly criticized 
by columnist,
1/25], Jennifer Meyers accuses 
me of not using facts. All state
ments in my column were backed 
by articles whose sources ranged
the Editor
from United Nations press re
leases, to Amnesty International 
reports, to Physicians for Human 
Rights newsletters, to U.S. State 
Department reports. If Meyers 
is interested in facts, I will most 
happily supply her with sources. 
I ask her to document hers, with 
the same potential for authenti
cation.
It is strange that in eight para
graphs, Meyers cannot join me in 
condemning Israels systematic 
use of torture but must excuse 
Israels actions because the 
deportees are terrorists. 
Meyers righteousness is more 
than a little ironic, considering 
that Israel helped found Hamas 
as an attempt to divide the PLO.
I find it odd that a democratic 
state would deport people simply 
based on affiliations. I cannot 
deny that there are Hamas mem
bers among the deportees, but
aside from affiliations, there has 
been no evidence, nor trials, nor 
convictions of any of the 415 refu
gees. For Israel to have deported 
these people without due process 
of law, while claiming to be a 
democracy, is to mock the mean
ing of the claim.
Meyers is hypocritical to label 
others terrorists when former 
Israeli leaders were terrorists 
against the British while attempt
ing to drive them out. The Brit
ish were perceived as unjust oc
cupiers, just as the Israelis are 
perceived today by many Pales
tinians.
During British occupation, Is
raeli nationalists robbed banks, 
executed collaborators, assas
sinated British officials, and 
planted numerous bombs which 
killed hundreds of innocent by
standers. What is the difference 
between those actions and those
of the Palestinian Freedom Fight
ers of today?
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin 
has refused to negotiate with 
Yassir Arafat, the leader of the 
PLO which represents the major
ity of Palestinians. Arafat has 
called for moderation and nego
tiation, yet/ his attempts are 
snubbed. Israel wants peace, yes, 
but only when it suits them.
Finally, Meyers claims we have 
an obligation to support Israel. 
I support the right of every Is
raeli, and indeed of every human 
being, to live free and in peace. 
To imply that the U.S. is obli
gated monetarily, to any country, 
is to put that countrys interests 
ahead of Americas. And in my 
opinion, that is tantamount to 
treason.

The
1 Housing Office
is now accepting applications 
from groups of students who would like to be 
considered for residency in one of the 7 Special Interest Houses.
The four Special Interest Houses in the Margaret Morrison Complex are 4-bedroom,
8-person apartments. The three Special Interest Suites in Resnik House are two 8- 
person houses with 3 double rooms and 2 single rooms; and one 7-person house 
with 3 single rooms and 2 double rooms. While all 8-person houses include 2 
bathrooms, the 7-person suite has just one bathroom and must be occupied by 
members of the same gender. The Margaret Morrison houses include a kitchen and 
living room. The Resnik Hall suites do not include a kitchen. In order to be eligible 
for consideration for a Special Interest House, a student group must have at least 
eight members (seven in the case of the house in Resnik), and two alternates.
The specific goal of the Housing Office in providing the Special Interest Houses is to 
encourage situations where the living environment complements the learning 
opportunities of the residents involved, where specific educational goals outlined by 
the member-residents are understood and enhanced and where outreach programs 
are provided by the group to the residence hall community.
/
If more than 7 groups of students submit applications for these Special Interest 
Houses, a decision will be based on a comparison of the educational goals presented 
and the likelihood of serious educational benefit being derived from residency in 
this type of living situation as well as the anticipated impact the group will have on 
the residence hall community.
Application forms are available in the Housing Office and must be filled out and

Intramural madness sweeps gym
Go down to the gym some
time, open the door, and step 
' inside. I guarantee that the 
first sound that you are going to 
; hear is the rhythmic thumping 
of basketballs on the parquet.
; The intramural basketball 
! season has begun, and already 
' the competition is heating up.
! With over a hundred teams 
 playing, youre going to see 
jnore basketball than you can 
handle in the next few weeks.
; Likewise, the IM floor hockey 
season is starting, with teams 
already cracking skulls in eager 
anticipation of the carnage in 
! Thistle Gym.
I dont know what it is about 
these two IM sports that twists 
the mind of your typical CMU 
student, but as soon as game 
time rolls around, it becomes 
the seventh game of the Stanley 
Cup or the last game in the 
NBA finals. Its really scary. 
Some people really exhibit 
honest-to-God signs of schizo
phrenia and multiple personali
ties as they adopt the personali
ties of their favorite sports 
; hero. Ive seen the eyes of 
Detroit Red Wings bruiser Bob 
1 Probert staring at me in the the 
form of a scrawny 5-foot fresh; man.
[ And late one night, while 
; getting ready to leave the gym,
I noticed a classmate of mine 
 who was practicing for his 
basketball team, taking shots 
i and doing layups. That in itself
 is not peculiar, and I wouldnt 
; have given him another look 
; had he not been talking to 
himself: Jordan has the ball,
 dribbles down the lane, he 
fakes to his left, then to his 
right, leaving the defenders in 
complete confusion. He goes up,
 he scores! What an incredible 
shot! It kinda makes you 
wonder.
Some of those IM basketball 
teams are incredibily talented, 
and others are ..'. not. And its 
always funny to see a match-up 
between two teams that are 
directly opposed to each other 
on the scale of talent, in a 
Keystone Kops sort of way. I 
swear, some of those Minors 
teams could pass for 
^Pittsburghs answer to a 
^professional basketball team.
And floor hockey is no better.
: I just love it when a 240-pound 
! ex-football player figures out 
that the hockey stick can be an 
effective tool for practicing open 
 heart surgery right there in the 
| gym. You can practically see 
when the realization sets in, as 
dull smile crosses his face,
 and he wipes a bit of drool from 
his lower lip.
Yes, there are people who 
play these intramural games 
! who somehow derive extreme 
pleasure from being the cause 
f human suffering. But I cant 
say that I blame them. Anyone 
who has played either of these 
,;sPorts knows what Im talking 
about. Whenever we see 
someone get slam dunked into 
the basket by a student who 
looks like Andre the Giant, we 
shake our heads, offer our 
condolences, walk away and 
taugh, all the while thanking 
God that that didnt happen to 
us.
But I guess thats all part of 
the excitement of IM Sports. So 
kt us usher in the new age of 
barbarism play ball!

Huge win for womens basketball
Tartans upset league leading Bears of Washington U.
ByLUBOMIR KOCHANSKYJ
Tartan Sports Editor

Head coach Gerri Seidl agreed 
with her. We needed to settle
Heres the scenario: down, relax, and set our offense.
Friday night. The Bears of We threw the ball away so much. 
Washington University come into We had to stop making our own 
Skibo gym with the 
best record in the 
University Athletic 
Association (UAA) at 
6-1 (16-2 overall).
Looks real tough 
for the Tartans.
Carnegie Mellon, 
fourth in the UAA at
4-5 has come off a 
poor performance at 
Brandeis University 
(January 31) where 
they lost 68-38.
Would the Tartans 
be ready?
The two teams had 
already played each 
other on January 21 
in St. Louis, with the 
Bears winning81-75 
in overtime.
Should Skibo gym 
even be opened for 
the game?
The matchups had 
all the makings of 
another Tartan de
feat. Seven minutes 
into the game, they 
were already losing 
14-2.
As the proverbial 
towel was being thrown in by the 
Tartan supporters and players, a 
number of hands reached out and 
pulled it back. Those hands be
longed to junior forward Jeanine 
Megahan and sophomore center 
Meredith McKnight.
Both players got the offense 
started by outscoring the Bears 
102. Five minutes later, they 
had cut the lead to two at 16-14.
As Washington University 
went on an 114 run to lead at the 
half 27-18, the Tartans found 
themselves on the ropes again.
I think we came out a little bit 
nervous in the first half. We were 
rushing our offense and throw
ing a lot of passes away, said
Rob Gloser/ Tartan Photographer 
Ae0e9U4B AFbUPB4 Pnei Dt 1n0 4#n -n0e tnUb4iM
mistakes. They werent doing 
anything to us defensively that 
warranted those mistakes. We 
just threw the ball away, said 
Seidl. Its frustrating when you 
get so close and then you let the 
other team coifie back like that.
When the whistle blew to start 
the second half, the Tartan Five 
(Megahan, McKnight, senior cap
tain Kelly Sterling, junior Mary 
Moore and sophomore Jenny 
Gretz) came out like a team pos
sessed. They went on a 14-2 tear 
and took their first lead of the 
game 32-31 on a basket by Gretz.
What did Seidl say to the team 
in the locker room?
At halftime, I said we were
okay. They needed to know I was 
confident in them. I was. I felt we 
would be okay if we kept playing 
defense. Defense is the key. The 
shots would come through, said 
Seidl.
This inspirational talk, and the 
strategic substitution of Gretz, a 
good shooting guard, for the more 
defensively oriented sophomore 
Christa Sober, were the keys to 
the teams turnaround in the sec
ond half.
Seidl was pleased with Gretzs 
performance. I thought she pen
etrated real well, and also gave 
up the ball. She played a real nice 
game, and got some real key re
bounds. Gretz had eight points 
and four rebounds on the night.
I was able to get into a rythym 
with the rest of the team playing 
the entire second half, Gretz said. 
Its better for me that way. I got 
in there and did what the coach 
wanted me to do. I did my best. I 
really feltwe could win thegame.
The secondhalfwas dominated 
by Megahan and McKnight, To
gether they combined for 31 
points and 14 rebounds (Megahan 
had 16 points and four rebounds, 
and McKnight had 15 points and 
10 rebounds).
Meredith played both ends of 
the floor. She was playing very 
well defensively. She was re
bounding. She had some power 
moves that I havent seen all year. 
I really think she had an excel
lent game, said Seidl. When she 
picked up her fourth foul in the 
second half, there was no doubt 
in my mind, I wasnt going to take 
her out of the game because she 
was too powerful a force. Im re
ally glad she didnt commit the 
fifth foul.
Both teams got caught in a see
saw battle until the 5:38 mark 
when the Tartans began to pull 
away, thanks mainly to eight 
straight points from McKnight. 
Sophomore Chandra Buist 
sparked the run with a pass dis
guised as a shot to McKnight for 
the assist.
McKnight finished the evening
anp Gleser/Tartan Photographer 
ODbUn0 Av0f Ann0e t0etv0ei 4n Fv4FB 4Be ntebUbP 4Ut n1 4Be Pv-eM ;
with 23 points (9-15 field goals,
5-6 free throws), 14 rebounds, 
two assists, one block and one 
steal.
She hit a number of key foul 
shots in the closing minutes of 
the game.
Ive been working on my foul 
shots, even before the season 
started. Its just great to be able 
to hit them when we really need 
them, said McKnight.
Megahan finished with 20
points (8-14 field goals, 4-6 free ! 
throws), four rebounds, six as- 1 
sists, and three steals.
The final score was 59-53. This j 
win improves the team record to ;

In a rematch of last months

came out and dominated Wash

defensive pressure and aggres
siveness on the part of the Tar
tans. It wasnt very hard getting 
up for them. We wanted to win 
that game pretty bad. We had 
never beaten them since we joined 
the UAA, and they would some
times let us know that, said jun
ior forward Matt Reiprish.
The game opened slowly for 
CMU, as they fell behind in the 
first three minutes. However, at 
16:54 of the first half, junior cen
ter Charlie Connors hit a short 
jumper to take the 
lead away from the 
Bears. About 30 
seconds later, jun
ior forward Derek 
Dragisich canned a 
layup and drew the 
foul to extend the 
lead. Freshman 
Kevin Byrne com
pleted the sevenpoint run a minute 
later with a power
ful drive to the 
hoop. The Bears 
would never again 
own the lead in this 
contest.
Atl3:37, Bears 
small forward Gene
came off the bench and quickly 
regained the lead on a basket 
from underneath. For the next 
fewminutes, the Carnegie Mellon 
squad showed some of their best 
defensive pressure of the season, 
causing the Bears to cough up the 
ball a few times. We felt like we 
were in control. We took the lead 
and held onto it. We also played 
tough defense. Rather than let
ting their offense come to us, the 
idea is to attack them and make 
them give up the ball, said Johns.
By the 6:55 mark, the Tartans 
were up 23-20. It was then that 
their foul shooting kicked in. 
Byrne, and senior co-captains 
Todd Jenkins and Chris Benec 
combined for six straight free
scrambling on the floor for the 
ball with two Bears around him. 
After pulling loose, he gave a 
quick look and chucked the ball 
across court to Benec. Benec hit a 
three-point shot and drew the 
foul to complete an amazing fourpoint play.
Washington had a short rally, 
scoring four 
points in the 
last three 
seconds to 
pull the score 
to 38-32 at

10The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  8 February 1993
Which team will claim NCAA hoops crown?
Bobby Knights Hoosiers will be victorious
A VIEW FROM THE BENCH
by Andrew Sproule
Duke, as usual, seems to be the favorite to take 
the NCAA tournament. They have taken two titles 
in two years. Not an easy feat. Therefore, it is easy 
to see why people think they will go on to do it 
again.
Looking at the team reinforces that belief. Grant 
Hill at forward, Bobby Hurley at point guard, 
Thomas Hill at the other guard, and, replacing the 
irreplaceable Christian Laettner, Cherokee Parks 
steps in as a formidible center  maybe even 
better on the boards than Laettner. This team is 
not going to just disappear from sight.
Because of this, all of the other powerhouse 
teams are going to be gunning for them. Kansas 
has one of the best back-court combinations going 
with Adonis Jordan and Rex Walters. They lost 
only one starter last year and are going to be hard 
to stop.
Kentucky, led by Jamal Monster Mashburn, 
beat Duke once already this year and now have the 
smell of victory about them.
And please dont forget Cincinnati. Last year, 
they became the first team from a newly formed 
league (The Great Mid-West) in history to go to the 
final four and they are a sentimental favorite. 
However, even with these great teams waiting to 
dethrone Duke, the Big Ten has steadily been 
building up a dynasty of their own.
The Big Ten isnt relying on one team  the 
conference as a whole is beginning to look like the 
future King of March Madness. Last year, they 
featured two teams in the final four and one in the 
regional finals. That means that two of the top four 
teams in the country were from one conference. 
What is really amazing is that those same two 
teams are back with little or no loss of players from 
last years teams.
Indiana lost to Duke in the final four last year 
and they are looking to be an even better team this 
year. They dont have a center and that could be a 
problem. However, the rest of the team is so strong 
that the gap in the middle may not end up being 
that important. Calbert Cheaney and Alan 
Henderson are stong in the front court with strong 
support from the guards Damon Bailey and Greg 
Graham. Cheaney has a good chance of being Big 
Ten player of the year and if he and Bailey continue 
to play the kind of ball they are capable of, Indiana 
will take Duke to school.
The championship of the tournament showed 
that Michigan was really an unexperienced team 
that had some maturing to do. Duke looked better 
playing against Michigan than they wouldve 
against any other team. That is exactly the point. 
Michigan was a team of freshmen playing in a 
game that is, for the most part, reserved for the 
teams that have grown and played together for 
years. They were all freshmen and they have all 
returned. Chris Webber may be nominated as 
national player of the year and Juwan Howard is 
one of the best possibilities for all conference hon
ors. Both players are going to dominate the boards
in almost any game. Guiding the team is Jalen 
Rose, the most consistent player of the Fab Five. 
Jimmy King, Ray Jackson, and James Voskuil 
round out a team that is already great. If they stay 
the full time theyre eligible, they may become one 
of the most amazing teams in basketball history.
Look for a championship game that involves both 
of these teams.
Duke will make a showing but will collapse 
under the weight of these two great teams. With 
Bobby Knight having more experience and skill 
than Michigans Steve Fisher  who is not a bad 
coach, just not Knightthe championship will be 
won by superior coaching and Indiana will own the 
crown cherished by every college basketball team.
A big Ohio State fan, Andrew Sproule has not 
been able to get over Jimmy Jacksons ill-fated 
jump to the NBA, only to see him sit out the season.
Blue Devils, Bobby Hurley go for three-peat
A VIEW FROM THE BENCH
by Darren Chiappetta
I hate Duke. I hate their yuppy, prep school-ly 
fans. I think Bobby Hurley looks like a rat thats 
just been rescued from the sewer. I hate the camera 
shots of the fathers of every Duke player (Im sick 
of seeing Calvin Hill, frankly). To this day, I abso
lutely despise Christian Laettner. Perhaps the 
thing I hate most about Duke, though, is that 
sometime early this spring in New Orleans, Duke 
will become the first team since the great UCLA 
teams ofthe 1960s and 1970s to win three consecu
tive National Collegiate Athletic Association mens 
basketball championships.
This season, everyone has talked about the Big 
Ten and Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) as the 
two premier conferences in the country. Duke is
Naris Slamwalla/ Tartan Artist
currently in third place in the ACC, having lost 
conference games on three of the last five Sundays. 
As of this writing, they are 16-3 and are currently 
ranked sixth in the USA Today Coaches Poll. 
Dont worry, though. Duke will be there at the end 
of the season, against my vehement wishes.
Teams that have a realistic chance to interrupt 
Dukes championship run include Indiana, Ken
tucky, Kansas, and Michigan. For starters, lets 
look at the two Big Ten teams. Indiana is led by 
Calbert Cheaney and Alan Henderson. Everyone 
knows how good a coach Bobby Knight is. They are 
a definite national title contender, but if Cheaney 
goes cold in the tournament, watch for his team to 
stand around waiting for him to deliver. They could 
be an early upset victim in the NCAA tournament.
The Hoosiers will fight for the Big Ten title with 
Michigan. The Wolverines attack is spearheaded 
by childhood buddies Chris Webber and Jalen 
Rose. The Fab Five have now become the Super 
Sophs, and it is time for them to prove that they can 
win the big game. That means beating Duke, which 
they will not do.
Kansas is an outstanding team, but a team with 
a point guard named Adonis is just too cute of a 
story for the Jayhawks to win a championship.
That leaves Kentucky, the only team with a 
legitimate chance to knock off Duke. The Wildcats 
are led by the possible first pick in next years NBA 
draft, Jamal Mashburn. Hes a 68 player who can 
bang inside, then run the break like a guard. If you 
play off him a step, hell knock down the threepointer. What makes Kentucky dangerous is that 
they have the supporting cast to complement 
Mashburn and that they shoot the three; if not so 
well, then at least very often. Kentucky is never out 
of any game.
We took a look at the contenders, now a capsule 
of the champions. True, Laettner and Brian Davis 
are gone, but the Devils still have one essential 
component: Hurley. Hes the best team player in 
college basketball. Period. His playmaking and 
leadership make everyone around him better. In 
the last two years, hes also added a potent jump 
shot to his repertoire. He now has the ability to 
finish off Duke opponents by draining a threepointer. Hes still the ugliest person Ive ever seen, 
though. Grant Hill is a great athlete who can run 
the floor and fill the nets from the outside. Hes 
already been called the heir apparent to Michael 
Jordan by a network announcer. And hes only a 
junior. Hes the only Duke player that I like. 
Thomas Hill, a senior, starts on the other side. Hes 
a consistent player who can score 25 points on any 
given night, and hes a great finisher on the break.. 
Hes a wuss, though. Did you see him cry like ababy 
after Laettner hit The Shot against Kentucky last 
year? Antonio Lang is usually the fourth starter. 
At least, thats what it says in the program. He 
doesnt usually have much of an impact on the final 
score. Perhaps the key to Dukes three-peat is the 
play of their center, Cherokee Parks. Only a sopho
more, if he plays as well inside as he has shown he 
can, Duke will be tough to beat. Dukes bench is 
only OK, but is good enough to spell the starters

Duke will win NCAA hoops
jcTr 10n- page 10
and keep the lead the Devils usually have.
Duke has one of the best coaches in the country 
in Mike Krzyzewski. Hes a great strategic coach 
and an excellent motivator, both traits ho learned 
while playing under Knight at West Point during 
the 1960s.
He has said in interviews that Duke isnt looking 
to repeat their two consecutive championships; 
rather, they are trying to win a new national title 
each season.
His unflappable manner and winning aura seems
to rub off on his team, which has reached the NCAA \ 
Final Four five years in a row.
Add everything together, and it equals one thing: 
Duke will win another national championship, and 
I will spend two and a half hours on Championship 
Monday swearing at my television sot. Again. God, _ 
I hate Duke.
Tartan Junior Staffwriter Darren Chiappetta, a 
freshman football player and new member of the 
Sports Section, is really sticking his neck out here 
predicting Duke will win.
Men clinch first winning record since 1986
MEN, from page 9
The Bears enjoyed a short rally, as they scored 
six straight points over the next minute.
With 2:38 remaining in the game, the Bears 
resorted to fouling and the Tartans responded 
nicely, hitting eight straight free throws and 12 of 
their next 14 attempts, to hold on to a commanding
11 point lead.
In the last two and a half 
minutes, the two teams com
bined for an astounding 25 
points. Carnegie Mellon held 
on strong to win 78-67.
We played to win. Rather 
than trying to run out the 
clock, we played to win. When 
youre ahead, you cant just 
sit back and run out the clock.
We took care of the ball and 
hit our free throws.
We also did a real good job 
on our rebounding. We out 
rebounded them by 10, which 
is pretty good, especially con
sidering their size, said 
Wingen.
Dragisich lead the Tartans with 20 points and 
nine rebounds. He shot an impressive nine for 10 
from the field. Connors also ended the game with 
nine boards. Jenkins finished the night with 12
points. Reiprish lead the team with four assists. Sunday, and will host Denison on Wednesday.
The team finished the game shooting nearly 75 
percent from the line, compared to Washingtons 
58 percent.
The victory extends the Tartans win streak to 
four and brings their record to 13-5 overall. Fridays 
victory ensures the team of their first winning 
season since 1985-86. Carnegie Mellon is now 
even in conference play with 
a 5-5 record. Johns com
mented on the ups and 
downs of the season thus 
far.
Were excited now, he 
said. When we lost a few 
games in a row, we thought 
our season was taking a U 
turn. Now were back on 
track and our hopes are back 
up about making the tour
nament.
It was just a real solid 
team effort. Johns, Reiprish, 
Hosni, and Benec did a great 
job off the bench.
Pugh and Jenkins were 
steady from the points. I 
think were really starting to mesh. Theres not a 
game for the rest of the season that we cant win, 
says Wingen.
The Tartans travelled to Haverford College on

Why waste a terrific set
of hooters and legs
under the stupid costumes 1 made?
I should be proud of my body 
and besides, women were liberated.
Nicky, the other dancer, 
was the only friend I ever hadshe showed me how to dance 
like Bruno wanted.
She said the first time's the worst, 
after awhile you get used to it.
I asked how longshe said as long as it took to get drunk.
It wasn't th terrible air of eyes 
on places 1 couldn't even see 
that made me forget every step I'd learned, 
but scraping the pieces of what was left 
of the costumes I made off the floorgrasping them to my front 
as I ran without breath 
or destination.
I drank 'til I got sick and still cried 
no matter how tight 
1 squeezed my eyes.
She gave me some pills 
that shut my eyes tighter 
than they'd ever been.
Nicky taught me about menhow if they get real excited 
about a woman and can't be with her, 
that it causes them a bad pain.
She said there's a lot of power 
in taking away that pain.
She's dead now.
Bruno bought the Mambo Clubit wasn't makin' any money.
Men' never came to see my act 
more than once.
He said it'd still be the Mambo Club, 
but we had to get with it, be happening.
1 could still dance, but his way,
"Lump it or leave it."
He said that all the time.
He hung a swing in the front windowit had a pink fuzzy seat with white fringe.
He built a little stage with mirrors behind it. 
He wanted two dancers 
so the customers wouldn't get bored 
looking at the same broad all night.
One would dance while the other swung 
in the window wearing a big smile 
and a tiny-weeny bikini.

It is evening. The snow falls as the cigarette smoke rises. 
The lights off, the small room is cast with the eerie orange 
glow of the the street lamps, save for the eerie orange glow 
of his cigarette butt, pulsing on and off with each heavy drai
He is looking out. A postcard in his left hand. The forget
fulness was after him again. Did it matter? No matter. The 
blank mask, the glass eyes. What of this? He turns to the desk, 
and signs the bottom of the card.
I write you, write me. Love, Me.
Hastily licking and placing the stamp, he puts it on the pile of 
postcards on the desk, all similar looking, unpostmarked, sent. He
turns now to a picture under glass, and exhales. It is a black and
white photograph, a woman with long, dark waving hair. It is slightly 
out of focus; she is looking down at something. Hello. I know I miss 
you. She has a graceful, if not indifferent smile. He turns back to 
the window, looking out, dragging from his cigarette again.
It was not my own addiction, it was yours. These withdrawal symptoms respond to your addiction. I became 
(looked on you in an abstract sort oi way, an answering machine, responding to the poison you wanted.
Come here, I want you. I picked up your call automatically, receptive like an addict.
Twelve noon. He is on the phone in the living room. His voice is the only one which can be heard, remember the time this summer
when we went to the riverside park? - The butter-fly that landed on me and stayed for a while. - I knew you would remember; I
remember. Its too bad we didnt take a picture, but we both saw it. We can tell each other again and again over the phone. - What 
did you say?  When did this happen to you? - Well Im glad I can hear about it. I know it happened now. - Youre having problems 
hearing me? Is there static on that end of the line? - Well, Ill try again soon. Take care. I love you. - Ill be in touch.
Cool and frosty outside as the sun shines. He Sits at 
turns toward the picture under glass. Her smile is gone,
ce remains. He is disturbed. I must write you. I want
lain things to me. For my benefit, I write, but I want
." He turns to the desk. He grasps the pen and paper
he side of the pile of postcards, and then taps a cigahe pack. The ridiculous ways which allow me to try to
span this preposterous distance to you, my other half, you who are my
self removed. The miles, the months. What else can I offer but noise 
on a phone and scratch on a paper? I will try once more, for me, for 
us. From the living room comes the housemates voice. Did you say 
something?" No. I was just talking." You always talk to yourself.
No one else seems to be able to hear." So whats the point of your
making the noise?" So I can hear it. You should really listen to
yourself sometime." I always do. He lights his cigarette and begins 
the letter, the post card.
e m'appelle__________. You were taking French class when we re-found each other.
I haven't taken French since fourth grade. I was much more comfortable with the
introduction "Ich heisse__________," "I'm__________," or simply by waiting long enough
so that formal introductions wouldn't be necessary. It was you who renamed me, 
and so I remain without you. Why are you listening to me? Why are you still clinging 
to my voice that has been disembodied for so long? Perhaps it is unfair of me to ask 
you. You can't always control what you hear. Sometimes what we wish to tune out 
is too far away to escape our attention. The radio is on the other side of the room or 
even on your side, but you are sitting down and that voice from the past, my voice, 
this uncalled for speech, enters your ear.
The sun has disappeared behind the clouds in the sky. He continues.
/ can't quite hear you. What? You're right. It would be easier if I can
just explain why I am speaking to you. But making explicit my desire for addressing 
or undressing you isnot that easy my love, saveto saveyouas my love. My 
heart palpitates on electric currents currently or in anticipation of our speakingso 
much so that as you surmise I wouldn't dare hold you, hold on to you, hold you up if 
I didn't have a pre-text and a text and a tremendous desire to hold you up over me 
around me that stems from no text at all. The pre-textthe Post Card. Oh my love.
I don't know why you remain so near, still wishing to hear, of this text, when your very 
nearness brings such longing to my tongue, not to translate, not to speak, not even 
to whisper in the air that mires with you, but to suck, to sup, to lap the nectar of your 
lap, to wet the wetness: from which I come within the locus from which you come 
and ve cum when we are one. Oh love, please remain. It is your breath, your faint 
sighs and thighs and desire to point me to keep me pointed with your hands in front 
and simultaneously behind me. Just the thought of your contradictory caresses keeps 
me in temporal ecstasies.

He stops. The cigarette is nothing but a length of ash. 
There it is again. His memory never seems authentic, it 
continually changes; the casting of the past in the

---------------------------------------------------

guise of a new present. He lays the pen down, and begins to riffle through the pile
of post cards, the receipts of his relationship.
No matter.
He stops and turns to the picture under glass. The photo seems to be slightly con
torted, though for the most part the same as before. Her indifference remains. To
him it is un- changed?
I know I miss you.
He riffles through his receipts again.
That's how he "finds" her, though he will never really know her name or make out her address. Without locating her, he finds her, then, gets her on the line, and hooks her.
That's how she startshistory, heroine, or simply that which arrives at starting. The big bang of instantaneousness, the clash of temporal commencement, spatial contraction.
Monday. It is a day much like the previous day, only more so. 
Jjartment walking into the living room. He is heavily dressed and 
has a black leather satchel slung over his shoulder. Classes are done for the day.
Next to the phone, the answering machine light blinks.
Late afternoon. He enters the a
It presupposes the existence of another telephone, somewhere, though its atotality as apparatus, its singularity, is what we think of when we say "telephone." To be what it is, it has to be 
pluralized, multiplied, engaged by another line, high strung and heading for you.
He presses the button for message recall. The message plays. It is her, though her voice cannot be heard. She speaks to
him from the past. It is hard for him to imagine her day of warm weather in his day of cold weather. But he now knows that
it is a warm day. He continues to listen as she narrates a day of her official history, as he tries to piece it into the entire off
icial history of the relationship, to continue its legacy? He did not have to do this when they were together. He does not know if 
she can still agree with what he can only assume is his correct version of the official history of the relationship. But he is still
driven by his desire to exist in more than the immediate present. She is the main marker of the living past. He needs her for the
assurance of a past agreed upon to have passed, although his own memory is the final word. The first word as well? The only words 
possible? The message has ended.
If this is to be a story of love, it is because he says that she 
has a voice to which one loves to listen. He fascinates, 
hallucinating her voice. They describe each other to themselves. A nonreflexive self, for their blindness lets them see 
with the eyes of the other. Expropriated orbs: the "she" that 
sees herself is a he, if eyeballs have a sex. This is how the story 
began, hopelessly saying we have to see. Desire split off from 
itself. He still does not know her name, nor her address, norher 
telephone number.
Late evening. Bitter cold as th
snow falls once again. His cigarette butt___|glows orange as he deeply drags off of it.
c mask stares out of the window. He knows about 
having to make some of his leisure time available for this long distance relationship.
His use of that time as mediated through the technology of the telephone, through the 
apparatus of the postal system: his immediate leisure time spent trying to experience
what is not his immediate leisure time, or else suspended for a supposed future use by 
her. The deferral of the immediate present to an uncertain past or future. He wonders 
whether it is ever his immediate leisure time as such. For a second he asks why he con
tinues this relationship which cannot take place in the immediate present, although he 
struggles to make it all seem as coherent as it seemed when they were together.
He turns to the picture under glass. The picture is more contorted than before.
The face is somewhat unrecognizable, the indifference almost twisted from her face.
I must continue to write you. For my benefit, I write, but I want you to receive.
From the living room comes the housemate's voice.
Did you say something?"
No. I was just going to write."
You always write to yourself."
No one else seems to be able to receive my letters."
So what's the point of your scrawling on paper?
So I can receive it.
You should really read your letters sometime."
I always do."
He puts out his cigarette, and turns on his desk lamp.
Grasping a pen and the post card, he continues where he left off.
What ecstasy what staceous your movement brings. Your rhythms cause or were caused by my upturned eyes rolling bock, back to you, to you who can never see them or is it me who is lorbidden to ever see you? What damnation to be together as we are now, to be 
alone together as we are now(or you are all there is lor meand not to see you. To meet you to enter you through your orifices but like Orpheus never to see your lace, to spy your laceunlike a spy, to share with you the most intimate secrets, yet never to see you. I hear you and I 
know you know me, we can know each other, without sight. This radio between us your dark box that protects, that hides, your most secret source of transmission. I want to send to you, I want to send you, I want to commune with youwithout this trans, this tele, this crossing, this 
medium or media between us.
You Ve turned me on, now turn me up. Please respond and to my pleas turn me upit's the best we can do lor the moment, this our live moment or am I recorded, and long dead by the time I can stimulate lile in you? This is one ol the indeterminacies ol our
magnetism. The magnetic field which preserves me, keeps me forever able to receive you in this heightened state, this codelied state which also prevents me from proHering my most desired gill and prevents you from receiving my ultimate messdge my ultimate messagethe end result
ol our being bound togetherour deaths or was that external independent lile?
Oh child. Oh love, don't protest my request to hold you still, to still hold youstill. Sometimes your motion, the rhythms ol your legs that can carry you away Irom me, can also chase me away Irom you too soon. Yes Stay, uststay, that way, lor a moment. Cherish 
this moment, ol our suspension in air. This height, to which we together have ascended, to which we sent ourselves together to, knows many inversions. I dont know where I am. I don't know where you are. But where you are scarcely matters my love lor we are together. My love, 
my love, needs no direction, no destination, no destiny. My love needs no bounds, heeds no bounds, disseminates and inseminates you all over Irom this single position this single transmission, I 'sense-you-all' about me.
He stops. This is all based on the assumption is that he will see her again. For if he was not going to be with her again, in the future, 
sometime, what was the point in the continuance of this relationship? What if this is not the premise? But it must be.
He will be with her again, wont he?
The forgetfulness is catching up with him, but he feels.
She says that she loves him madly. That she's crazed with love for him. That she's prepared 
to leave everything for him. But she wants to retain the telephonic regulation. She refuses to 
see him. She says they will never meet. They'll never see each other. They constitute jointures 
that break off. It happens. The lines begin to cut.

---------------------------------------------------

Early evening. Wednesday. A cold, cloudy day. Or warm and sunny.
He is on the phone in the living room. His voice is the only one 
which can be heard. That must be nice. - What? - Well, Im 
not crazy about talking on the phone either. I mean its o.k. but 
I think its easy to hide through the phone. At least you can keep 
letters.  What do you mean? - I know letters and phone calls 
arent perfect, but theyre all weve got. - Youre spending too 
much time missing me? - Well I spend a lot of time missing you, 
but I still get things done. - What keeps me going? I know I 
will get to see you again,eventually. I suppose Im living for the 
future. - The last thing I would want to do is to keep you from 
doing something you want to. - I know Im not there but I cant 
help it right now. - What? - I think that static is getting 
worse on your end. Just dont decide anything drastic. - Ill try 
again soon. Take care. I really love you. - Ill be in touch.

and received. He turns to the picture under glass. The face is severely contorted, though the eyes, the nose,
the mouth are still discernable. Her identity is not. He is very uncomfortable. But I feel. I feel that
I miss you. Is that not enough? She said the silences on the phone were where both were missing the other 
but could not really put it in such simple terms. Language is often the poorest of servants. But does she not 
feel as strongly? He could have sworn she did. Did that get lost in the transmission? Or added? Love is not 
outside a system of sending. Are feelings to be reasoned? The post card must be continued. She must know.I 
must know. He takes a pen, and writes.
Oh love, how can I be objective? How can I break from this train of thought, our 
train, our trans our mission, to speak about Derrida as an external third, when I 
have such precious little time with you? How, dear love, can I share the delightful 
confusion between the two the uncertainty of who is who the ambiguity of I or you?
How can I explain the mixture of memory and desire, that ignites the fire, that des
troys to preserve? How can I instill in you his tropes, his premises, without showing 
them as central to us, for we are the subjects of his posts, we who are subjected, in
jected, to his cards, with his cards are the images which they contain. No, no please 
my love don't go. I am not wishing to be cryptic. I am desperately trying to break 
out of this crypt, desperately trying to speak to you. To you, and only you, my love.
Hold on to me, love. Love, be on me, love. Be therebe on me love this time. Be 
there. I'm not trying to be cute, to perpetuate the epistomological play for we are 
not about wordsthis message I am giving you, sending you, requesting that you 
give ear to, is not about words though that is the form which mediates it. My mess
age is that I love you. And no matter how often I repeat this phrase, you don't hear.It is definitely snowing again-it is definitely cold.
My love, it is not out of selfishness or disrespect that I don't send the Post Card to you. It is out of love and honesty that I confess I cannot will notand will not, as in desire not to, send this Post Card to you. You can obtain and retain those/these words as well as I. It would please me greatly if you do. But my love. Please listen to me now if ever you do my love. Derrida is not our destination. The post card is not being sent. It is passion that is sent. It is not his passion. It is my passion. And not my passion only. It is only my passion for you.I can't believe you listen to this whole address dressedwhen you know how I want to find you. How I want to mingle with you, how I want my breath to enter your every pore. I know these lips that speak, this mouth that moves has no right to taste you. Thus, no chance to make you flesh quiver again. I know-you-no longer feel the tension in your loins, at the breaching of this publicprivate space. So many others have your attention and thus hold not your attention with their public whispers you mistake to be yours alone. You will not trust me, or want not to trust me, preferring to think I'm speaking to another. You don't wish to acknowledge the honesty of my singular desire.
He stops. What if what is sent never truly arrives at the intended destination? Is there a choice?
He is almost tired. But instead turns to stare outside. A hopeless face covers his countenance. The cigarette box has been empty.
The street lamps cast their eerie glow.
That's how I found the telephone's absent tense,
the incinerated language you left behind. It's the rest of what I said to you. You thought I had forgotten. A residence that held us together, gathering us up in a phantom locus. I knew then that what 
connects is not related. Why else telephone each other? We should never have crossed the infinite distance of our apartness. Still, it left a space on our bodies. (I suppose you to have a body; in any 
case, the telephone tendered your secretion.)
I still have your phone number.
A snow-white Friday afternoon. Overcast.
He is on the phone in the living room. His voice is the only one which can be heard.
Uh, yeah. Hi. Its me. Im just calling to talk to you, though I seem to be calling an answering machine. There is definitely a lot of 
static on your end of the connection, though. Ill try again soon. Take care of yourself. I am really in love with you. Ill be in touch. 
Something is terribly wrong. The way he sends reflects the way he expects to receive. Has he not known this all along?
What of unconditional love. Is it that no matter what happens we will stick it out? Or that there are no set conditions, and thus may be 
terminated at any time?
Is the latter not the act of setting a condition?
School work must wait. The post card must be finished. An answering machine is not enough.
Striding into the small room, he sits down to finish the letter, the post card.
I know too, that not only these sounds, but the words I've sent to you, from the other side of the world, from this side of the world,have lost their meaning. And without meaning, we are lost. Lost, to each other, and lost, to ourselves, and lost from ourselves. For as Imentioned at the outset, it was you who named me. You alone who gave me definition.The photographic fetish fragmented and plained, sent via planes, made plain, to me, not the end of the imagined, but the desperation

---------------------------------------------------

behind the desire to re-imagine. And yet how could I respond to a package of suspended, is dissected silver fragments of photographic reality denied? How too, could I respond when my responses were returned with a disembodied hand, handed to me with red extended finger pointing? The mirror image of plateau, Plato's flat admonition that follows, warning, the warning that reads I no longer follow. From you who wrote "I will follow you to the end of the earth."? That dissected red hand under the cancelled mark of postage which bears the inscription "Return to Sender." I could not get through to you then. Nor can I get through to you now. Even when I dose my eyes. Close your eyes. Even if just for a second, shut your lids, shut out that which separates us, and we are close. So close. We are closer now than during that final call. That final clarion call complete with sirens that competed with our speech. The Sirens' song was victorious and we have not spoken since. You do remember that call no doubt? That call you made, pushed to the brink, far enough to transgress the privateto interrupt the office, to disturb the tumult of the job. And I, not knowing how to cease the alarms, how to silence the sirens, and you not believing you were disturbing the peace. Nor that the police, stationed here at school as everywhere, so close to the post, had already arrived. You would not believe my words that the guards had come to cease the shrieks, that I could not. To this day I don't know whether you believed their voices to be any more authentic than mine. Some how the shrieking subsided and with it the torment of your tormented calls. You would not believe me now if I were to recount the melodrama of our passion, the terror by post inflicted on others with the intent of other's harm. Or if I were to retell the tracking of motion the tracing of itinerary that the phone, also, can do so well. The tyranny of telecommunications, when all is ne
gated from afar.
He stops. His hand is tired from 
scrawling on the post card. But 
it must be finished. It will be.
Oh the folly of the passion that gives life, the folly of the passion that maintains and prevents and simply is life. And yet with all that as will at prepresent be recounted, you listen to me still. 
Still. I want to stretch out beside you, still. And you bare me out. You bare me and bury me in an endless cycle that has no more direction than the one sided messages we send, and cannot even 
ourselves decipher.
I write you, write me. Love, Me.
Hastily licking and placing the stamp, he puts it on the pile 
of postcards on the desk, all similar looking, unpostmarked, sent.
He turns to the picture under glass. Its chaotic distortion is 
complete. Only a mouth is discernable in the jumble of nothing.
It speaks to him. To his blank mask, the glass eyes.
I always had your phone number,
if I had anything at all. I feel the slightly demented, paranoid 
crashing coming on. It's ridiculous, having your withdrawal 
symptoms in my telephone call, surviving you in this way. It's 
as if I had sustained a hit of nuclear damage at the telephone, 
reducing my speech to the place of a black box after the crash.
I am crashing. It wasn't my addiction, it was yours. My with
drawal symptoms answer to your addiction. I became an an
swering machine, responding like a thing to your poison. Come 
here, I want you. I picked up your call, automatically, receptive 
ike an addict, structuring myself on the resistant woman who, 
after a sharp pain, dissolves into submission. That's the way she 
wrote it. Resistant but wanting. After the sharp pain. Then tranquilized by habit, increasing the dosages.
What else can I offer but noise on a phone and scratch on a paper?
There is no reply. He does not expect one.
I must call once more, for me, for us.
From the living room comes the housemates voice.
Did you say something?
No. I was just going to make a phone call.
You always call yourself on the telephone.
No one else seems to be able to receive my calls.
So whats the point of your making noise over a wire?
So I can receive it."
You should really listen to your calls sometime.
I always do."
He walks into the living room and picks up the telephone.
He punches in the number, her number.
1-900-CUM-SHOT.
He waits, and hears the echo of a reception.

Marie Salinger was thinking about the window washer as she waired for the six 
forty-eight express to Penn Station. He was handsome indeed, and she was alone. She 
had only seen him for a few brief moments as he stood on the platform outside the 
window of her twenty third floor cubicle. She wished it was her window, or rather 
that it was her office, because then maybe he would have noticed her. To her added 
depression, there were so many people milling about the office, how could he sec her 
staring at him? He gracefully applied the washing fluid and streaked ofTwith the 
rubber tool without so much as ;i glance her way. She figured he was trained to do 
that.
He inhabited her dreams for awhile, including a very sexual one the night before.
He was courageous soul, braving the gale winds and piercing sun to do the city a 
service. By god, he was a virtual hero. She remembered his scruff)', unshaven face 
scraping against her skin, and she remembered enjoying it immensely. As a conse
quence, she wasnt feeling very attractive this morning.
The air was slightly uncomfortable as ii always was this time ol morning. The other 
express trains had appeared suddenly out of the morning sunshine and blew across the 
middle track, upsetting Maries hair and the rest ol her affairs. No wonder she never 
felt attractive, the trains were always ruining her hair style.
Next to her, standing with the tips of his toes on the yellow warning line, was Mark 
Turow, a salesman. They had never met, though they lived close to each other in 
town. The most they ever exchanged was a friendly nod, the same nod everyone gave 
to fellow passengers of the six forty-eight, as if there were some special alliance that 
needed to be acknowledged.
Mark was pissed off about the scuff on his brand new Italian shoes. Appearance was 
everything in the office supple business. He preferred the sheik look, because he felt it 
gave his potential customers the feeling of being up with the times, the feeling of being 
hip in their choice of office furniture. Everybody wanted to feel hip, Mark had long 
decided.
He liked the hard sell, the fast talk, the wheel and deal. He was so good at it that he 
could afford the Italian shoes and the expensive suits that looked like they cost much 
more than he paid.He knew someone in the garment district, bur he still tended to lie 
about the price he paid. The other boys couldnt keep up with him, they came into the 
office with their conservative tan or navy blue suits. They had old raincoats and old 
ideas, he was the champion. In fact, his leather briefcase, the one with the gold-plated
buckles, he won in a sales drive. He never told anyone this. It looked obviously 
expensive, and he admired it every morning as it rested at his side on rhe train 
platform. This morning was no exception.
His newspaper was rolled efficiently under his arm and his coffee cup was steaming 
away in the morning air. Just then Bill Blotner scurried up rhe stairwell to the 
platform.
Hey Bill, Mark said politely.
Hey Mark, how are ya? said Bill as he tried to straighten out his morning affairs.
When he first moved to Kingston, Mark played cards a few times with Bill a few 
times, as they lived on rhe same block, but Mark generally didnt like to associate with 
Bill. He found Bill to be nothing more than a vulgar slob, with no taste or class. Bill 
was always rushing to the platform, making a scene of himself every morning. Mark 
wondered why Bill was constantly late; after so many times rushing up to make the 
train, huffing and panting, wouldnt Bill come to his senses and leave five minuted 
earlier?
Bill was always a mess; he could never keep his affairs together. He was late for 
appointments, for trains, he forgot things, his desk was all aclutter. Somehow, he got 
his accounting work done and made an honest living doing so. Bill really didnt think 
about it much. He never thought to keep an appointment book, or to buy organizers 
for his desk. It didnt matter to him that much.
He was excessive in everything, he ate too much, smoked to much, drank to much 
coffee, watched too many football games. He let his lawn go, rhe shrubs, the paint on 
his house. Ever)' weekend he made a pact with his wife to start getting himself in 
order, since she nagged him to do so. Ever)' week he failed.
When Bill came to the platform, it was time for Mark to check his watch, since the 
train was always close when Bill stumbled up. This time, the tradition was not 
necessary as Mark saw the headlight of the train approaching in the distance.
Hey Mark, you want to put a little wager on the game tonight? Dallas and 
Philadelphia! Bill said.
No thanks, Bill. I cant watch the game tonight, Ive got work to do. said Mark, 
not looking at Bill.
Thats alright, Ill tell you rhe score, Bill said and laughed, dont you trust me?
Mark said nothing.
The game was Bills every thought since he woke up that morning, which was not

---------------------------------------------------

Morning
very long ago. He loved to watch Monday Night Football and drink beer. He went 
over players in his head, trying to calculate who had the advantage in what part of the 
game. He decided the Philadelphia had the better defense, and the better quarterback, 
but Dallas might be able to cover rhe spread, they were capable of upsets. Then again, 
the game was in Philly. He was sure rhe Eagles would win.
The train got a little closer and the tracks started to vibrate slightly. The sound of 
whistling metal filled the air and echoed back and forth across the northbound and 
southbound platforms. There were only a few people waiting on the southbound side. 
After all, who beside bums needed to take a train down to Trenton? Plus, anybody 
who was anybody worked in New York and not Philadelphia.
And there was the train station bum, Marvin. He was pretending to sleep on a one 
of the benches by the telephone booths. Nobody ever sat on the benches except fo 
Marvin, and he was probably the reason why. He smelled and his clothes wer/' 
tattered. Most people intuitively knew that there was nothing wrong with the benches, 
but why take a chance?
Marvin was thinking about how hed gei his next drink. He thought this every 
morning. He was at the Princeton Junction station house so often that the trains 
began to lullaby him to sleep. To anyone else, the sound of the express was deafening. 
Most people turned away, or covered their ears. To Marvin, it was his mother singing 
a sweet song and pulling the covers gently up to his neck. The vibrations from the 
tracks rocked, him to sleep.
People like Marie, Mark, and Bill had stopped giving him money long ago; he had 
sapped the territory. Finding th means to get a drink was becoming more and more 
of an art form. He convinced some people that the welfare office had come by and 
they were going to set'him up, only if he called back within twenty four hours. Could 
they spare a quarter? People who were not as wisened as say, Mark Turow, or the 
ticket booth man, usually fell for this one.
The train was still speeding into view, and the horn blew. It seemed to blow a rush 
o^warm air over Marvin, making him very comfortable indeed. Maybe he wouldnt 
get up today at all. Maybe he could let the trains rock him into a stupor. Besides, he 
didnt feel much like begging.
And the ticket booth man Joe was thinking of getting some coffee in a while. And 
Mark Turow was still deciding what to do about his shoes. Marie Salinger was still 
feeling unattractive. And Bill Blotner was picking up the New York Post he dropped
when the train was only yards from the station.
And there was a loud screech,.and^parks flew skyward from the wheels.
Marie Salinger said, Oh my god.
Turow never looked up from his shoes.
The station house caught on fire because everything was broken from the impact. 
The bodies'clisappeared into the heaps of metal. A row of three orange and yellow 
seats flew into the parking lor and hit someones Mercedes. Nobody came out 
screaming, because everyone was dead, except Joe, who got out fine. He went to the 
telephone booth in the parking lot to call the polic.

Anonymous press secretary tells all 
Hillarys new rule endangers hubby
Neurotic Livingby Andrew Sproule
Lately, people have Baid that maybe 
Im a little too wrapped up in my own 
problems. Some have even suggested 
that my column is fluff. Im not hurt. 
Im used to people being jealous. Im 
concerned with the problems of our na
tion. In fact, I called the White House to 
talk, to my sources about what I think is 
a very serious problem that may bring 
this country to its knees. Hillary Rod
man Clinton has decided to ban smoking 
from the White House. No questions 
asked.
Okay, I didnt technically have sources 
to talk to; however, I did get someone to 
play Deepthroat to my Bernstein. I 
called the White House, Hello, my name 
is Andrew Sproule callingfrom The Tar
tan. Id like to speak with the press 
secretary, Mr. Stephanopolous. That 
request was followed by a click and a dial 
tone. They knew I meant business. I was 
continuously being disconnected. After 
going through that very same scenario a 
few times, I asked for anyone that could 
talk to the press. Finally, I was con
nected to the Assistant to the Press 
Secretary of Answering the Questions of 
Blithering, Neurotic Columnists, 
Beverly Baker. She, realizing that these 
questions were below her, connected me 
to an even lower-level functionary who 
would be my source.
Not wanting to reveal my source 
(Ernie Gibbels, who works at the White 
house Press Office, might get in trouble
q OC6uTa
if they knew he was talking to me), I 
agreed to keep his anonymity. As you 
will see, I couldnt have chosen a better 
source.
What are they serving at the first 
Clinton state dinner? I asked, starting 
slow so I didnt scare him off. Im not 
sure, said Ernie, Imean my source. 
Im pretty sure that he was trying to tell 
me, in code, that Spamloaf and Champale 
were going to be the highlights of the 
evening. Whats the President up to 
today? I said. Im not sure, he said. 
Actually, I could make up better re
sponses than Im not sure. If this was 
all I would get, why call? One more try. 
What about Mrs. Clintons anti-smoking policy? I asked. Oh, yeah I know a 
little about that. There will be no smok
ing allowed in the White House. Its the 
same policy they had at the Arkansas 
Governors Mansion. I think the Presi
dent is allergic to cigarette smoke, he 
said, finally loosening his tongue.
Did she ban all tobacco products? I
Phillip Joyce/Tartan Art Staff 
asked him. Im not sure. What do you 
mean? Ah, thought I had broken through 
the glibness. Can people chew tobacco? 
I said. Well she didnt ban it explicitly, 
but maybe implicitly, he responded, 
maybe he just liked teasing me.
I then explained my theory. All of 
Bills buddies were going to be from the 
South and likely to replace smoking with 
big wads of chew in their mouths. A 
definite image problem. Especially ifthe 
President keeps up his policy of having 
the press follow his every waking move. 
Newspapers around the world would 
have pictures of a State spit-off, not a 
dinner.
What about reporters at press confer
ences? I asked, knowing reporters to be 
smoke fiends. They mightjust stop show
ing up. The President wouldnt have any 
chances to be photographed while pick
ing a piece of popcorn from his teeth  
just an ordinary guy photo op. They can 
step outside. The press room has a door

Architecture students design 
new Phipps childrens wing
By ALEXIS DEPLANQUE
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
The Design Build Architecture class 
of fifth year students is working on the 
outdoor Childrens Garden, a new ad
dition to Phipps Conservatory. The 
project, which began last fall, is ex
pected to be completed by July.
The students are involved with both 
design and implementation aspects of 
the project. Project professor Mike 
Chirigos said, The aims of the project 
are to generate a feeling of cooperative 
effort and to study and understand 
the relationship between design and 
decisions of the construction process. 
The students provide free design work 
and labor while Phipps provides the 
supplies. Their work began last fall 
with the design and documentation of 
the garden.
The actual design for the Childrens 
Garden has three main parts  an 
amphitheater, a workbench area, and 
a garden space with exhibits. The am
phitheater, a partially enclosed area, 
willbeusedfor puppet shows, musical 
performances, and other childrens 
productions. The workbench is a place 
for more hands-on activities, such as 
gardening and planting. The rest of 
the garden is filled with exhibits geared
toward toddlers, such as a bog garden. 
Theres also an exhibit where kids can 
crawl through tunnels and pop-up 
through gopher holes.
The students are now beginning the 
actual construction of the garden. 
Things like plumbing and electrical 
wiring need to be contracted out, but 
the rest of the work will be completed 
by the students themselves. While 
much of their work hinges on the ar
rival of supplies, the students are still 
optimistic about the project.
Designing of the garden was fairly 
difficult and required the coordination 
of 17 individuals. Chirigos said, It is 
very difficult to work together on this 
kind of project. Not only did all ideas 
have to pass through the groupthey 
also had to be accepted by Phipps.
The final project was the result of 
cooperation on the part of both parties. 
One of the participating students, 
Suzanne Giguere, said, For what we 
could do and what they wanted, it was 
the best design we could do.
Architecture student Julie Reker 
said of her experience, Its a great 
opportunity to see a project all the way 
through. Parts of it are lots of fun, and 
parts of it are frustrating. Its kind of 
like seeing what it is like in the real 
world.

Schlag shares another campus legend: 
Physical Plant vs. Morewood Piano
Schlags Noseby Graham Gibby
The quest for information is 
nover ending, especially when you 
dont know what youre looking 
for. So far I have been lucky in 
that questions come up all the 
time and people always have an 
opinion on what the answer is (or 
should be)  or at least other 
things that should be con
sidered on the topic. And 
the best part is that these 
folks come to me! For in
stance, Dr. Erwin 
Steinberg, Vice Provost 
for Education, contacted 
me about the Baker Hall 
Factory folklore, as he 
put it.
Steinberg pointed out 
that at one time the wings
of Baker Hall were big ----------
bays, where foundry, 
bricklaying, and carpentry were 
taught. Swings and hoists hung 
from the ceiling, just like a fac
tory, and Im sure at times the 
building looked, sounded, and 
smelled like a factory.
A factor that makes the BakerHall-as-factory theory incorrect, 
however, is the land it sits on. 
Formerly part of Schenley Park, 
the land was given to Carnegie by 
the city specifically for his 
Carnegie Technical Schools. 
Steinberg doubts that the city 
would give land in a residential 
area, so close to Pitt, for a factory. 
I can recall, Steinberg says, 
eight oclock of a winter morn
ing, looking down from the 
presidents office, where the 
H&SS Deans office is now. About 
1946, I guess, two years before 
smoke control, and looking down 
the hall, there was a cloud of
ward the dip and Porter Hall. 
Continuing on with some loose 
ends from last weeks column, 10 
buildings were built before 1919, 
including CFA, Margaret Morr
ison, Hamerschlag (Machinery 
Hall), and Boss, McGill, 
Henderson, Scobell, and Welch. 
They were all part of Henry 
Hornbostels plan for the cam
pus, first submitted in 1904 and 
revised in 1906 and 1911. Sopho
more math major Jason Appelt 
wrote in asking about informa
tion on the current master plan. 
Six campus plans have been 
adopted since 1911, the latest 
put together by Dennis Clark & 
Associates. There are plans avail
able for viewing, but the easiest 
way to see the new campus is to
has a story to tell us about an old 
Greek Sing tradition that has 
since died out:
Up until about 83 Pi Lambda 
Phi used to singPi Lam Tales at 
Greek Sing. They were original 
songs that were new words to old 
tunes, memorializing some ofthe 
classic legends of campus.
One of these songs was, The 
Wreck of the Morewood Piano, 
sung to the tune of Gordon 
Lightfoots, The Wreck of the 
Edmund Fitzgerald. It seems 
that around 1979 a bunch of 
rather inebriated fraternity boys 
(genus unknown) managed to get 
the Morewood piano (which was 
then in a room under... roughly B 
tower (Morewood is much differ
ent than it was then)) out of the 
building without ei
ther the desk atten
dant knowing nor 
alerting the campus 
fuzz. This is the trick 
partthere was only 
one door, and no little 
booth for the desk at
tendant to sit in, so 
you could hear much

smog about halfway down, towander in to Skibo 100. If you're 
heading into the Tartan Grill 
from the New Dorm side of Grey 
Matter, go up those steps and 
turn right. Hanging on the walls 
are drawings of all the new build
ings, the campus layout, and 
some detail sketches. There may 
be a meeting going on, so be po

your hands off the munchie tray.
Last week there was also some 
syntactical confusion on the con
struction materials in Hunt. The

Slice of Life, Career Week 
teach about real-world issues
By HEIDI HOOVER
Tartan Contributing Editor
On Saturday, about 130 juniors and seniors 
joined 15 alumni for Slice of Life, a day-long 
conference designed teach students skills to 
help them in the professional world. Slice of Life 
is sponsored by Alumni Relations. It kicks off 
Career Week, which is sponsored by the Career 
Center.
About five years ago, Chuck Vukotich (chem, 
91) and Hunter Caffee (PM 56) first had the 
idea of holding a life skills conference for CMU 
students. The neat thing about the program is 
that it was an idea that alumni had that they 
wanted to do for students, said Steve Calvert, 
vice president for Alumni Relations. Caffee con
vinced the Pepsi company to donate some money 
the first year of the conference, in 1990. The 
conference was named after one of Pepsis soft 
drinks, Slice. Though the company did not con
tinue to subsidize the program, the name stayed.
An essential part of Slice of Lifes planning 
has always been student feedback. When plan
ning began for the program, alumni consulted 
students to find out what topics interested them 
and constructed the conference accordingly. This 
year, the program was coordinated by junior 
voice and history major Kristin Carbone, an 
Alumni Relations intern, with the help of Alumni 
Relations staff member Christopher Fox. Its a 
very dynamic program, said Calvert, because 
lots of people have lots ofideas and Tammy and, 
this year, Kristin, really used those ideas to 
improve the program. (Tammy is Tammy 
Hale, former associate director of Alumni Rela
tions, who headed the program in previous 
years.)
The whole evaluation system is taken very 
seriously, said Carbone, and my next job is to 
type all the comments and the little checkmarks 
[from the evaluations] into a report that will be 
analyzed at the next alumni executive board 
meeting.
Saturdays conference provided an example 
of how much the program coordinators try to 
conform the program to what the students want. 
Rania Hanna, a junior electrical engineering 
major, was one of a number of students who 
were dissatisfied with the Assertiveness and 
Communication workshop because the facilita
tor spoke on the subject of sexual harassment 
instead of the scheduled topic. Calvert and 
Carbone, who heard about the problem, spoke 
with the facilitator. She agreed to change her 
presentation on the spot.
Its vital to be that responsive to students 
because, as Carbone said, Our job is to bring the 
students the information they want, informa
tion they wont get in class. Many participants 
in Slice ofLife found that the conference achieved 
that goal.
Heather Thompson, a senior public and inter
national studies major, said that the program 
addresses issues that you don't learn about in 
the classroom but are necessary to survive in the 
world. She found the speakers well-chosen and 
liked the fact that they addressed pertinent, 
relevant issues.
Senior electrical engineering major Shawn 
Gettemy wasnt sure hed get much out of the 
day. I didnt really know how much it would
courtesy of Alumni Relations
help me, though the promo stuff looked pretty 
good, he said. Then I went to my first session, 
Marketing Yourself, and I just learned so much.... 
After I went to that, I really knew that this was
well-spent time.
Most of the alumni who facilitated workshops 
for this years Slice of Life are members of the 
alumni executive board, and most have helped 
with the program in the past. They ranged from 
a 54 graduate to as.recent as 89. The presenters 
were of diverse professions and included Brian 
Davidson (IM 89), a University of Pittsburgh 
law student; Vukotich, who works for the Al
legheny County Health Department as acting 
deputy director for the Bureau of Medical Ser
vices; David Kirr (E 59, E '60, IA 62), president 
of Investment Advisors in Columbus, Ind.; and 
Liz Muskat (Arch 86), architect and director of 
marketing at Castro-Bianco Piscioneri and As
sociates in New York City.
The alumni have many reasons for choosing to 
be involved. Carl Arendt, communications man
ager for Westinghouse Electric Corporations 
Productivity and Quality Center, led the ses
sions on Total Quality Management (TQM), a 
new style of management being used by many 
corporations and adopted last summer by CMU. 
He said, TQ is very important  I talk to 
students as much as I can. Theyre the future. 
Davidson, who helped lead Dual Career
courtesy of the Career Center
Couples with his wife Laura Davidson (Math 
and IM 89), said, [Laura and I] do it because we 
feel we have a responsibility to do something 
back for our school, since were in the area.
The quality of the speakers was high and 
consistent, which added substantially to the 
conferences effectiveness. And, said Carbone, 
All the speakers were great to work with.
With Slice ofLife as its kickoff, Career Week 
is off to a great start. This week the Career 
Center will be offering programs that add to and 
expand on Slice of Lifes offerings. The sessions 
include such wide-ranging topics as: Resumes 
for Artists: Employment & Exhibition, Help for 
Less Decided Majors, Career Opportunities in 
Biomedical Engineering, International Experi
ence and Overseas Employment: A Recipe for 
Success, and Properties of Paper, among many 
others.
This is Career Weeks third year, and accord
ing to John Michalenko, associate director of the 
Career Center, there is more departmental in
volvement than ever before. This Career Week 
is encompassing the whole campus community, 
he said. Im thrilled with the amount of partici
pation from student groups, departments, and 
corporations.
Michalenko says a common misconception 
about Career Week is that its only for juniors 
and seniors. I want to see undecided freshmen 
going to these programs or electrical engineer
ing freshmen who arent sure they want to be in 
electrical engineering going and talkingto these 
professionals, he said. Students dont realize 
their options  youd be surprised the things 
you can do, the places you can go. There are 
great grad programs, not just jobs, and not 
necessarily just in your major.
On Wednesday, in addition to the various 
workshops, is Job Fair 93, sponsored by the 
Career Center, Student Employment Office, and 
the Heinz School Career and Student Services 
Office. Students interested in summer or per
manent jobs will have the opportunity to speak 
with employers in the private, non-profit, and 
government sectors.
For those who werent able to attend Slice of 
Life, as well as those who were, Career Week 
offers a chance to learn more about what oppor
tunities are available and how to take advan
tage of them. There are sessions planned for 
freshman through seniors of all majors.
Any students who havent received the sched
ule in the mail may pick one up in the Career 
Center, WH 19. Said Michalenko, Everyone 
should go to these programsfreshmen through
Black History Month kicks off
By LAURA PALANKER
Tartan Features Editor
Spirit president Kyra Dorsey 
(senior, ChemE) welcomed stu
dents, faculty, staff, and commu
nity members to Carnegie 
Mellons Kick-Off Celebration of 
Black History Month last Satur
day evening, February 6. After 
Mistress of Ceremonies Tara 
Haughton (senior, chemistry) pre
sented the theme for the night, 
the festivities were off for an 
evening of enlightenment, enter
tainment, and, of course, black 
heritage.
The first performance, led by j 
freshman music major Daryl ] 
Young was a rendition of the 
song, Lift Every Voice and Sing. 
The song, an old Negro spiritual, 
is perhaps the best known of its 
genre, and is widely used as a 
Christian hymn and grade school 
music song.
Carnegie Mellons own Voices 
United Gospel Choir appeared 
next, performing without their 
traditional robes but with all of 
their traditional spirit. The per
formance included several tunes, 
such as Lift Up Holy Hands. 
Led by president Tara Haughton 
and joined by several soloists, 
the presentation was a wonder
ful musical celebration of black 
heritage.
After the VUGC performance, 
senior English major Blanchee 
Smith read poetry by prominent 
black female authors from the 
book Black Sister Poetry. [Blacks] 
are a very oral people, said Smith. 
Our main form of expression is 
oral. Smith read a poem called 
Only in This Way, about educa
tion and learning through the self. 
Smiths enthusiastic and dra
matic reading gave the poetry an 
immediacy and sternness.
Next, third grader Lindsey 
Walton of the Streams Elemen
tary School in Upper St. Clair 
presented A Moment in Black 
History. Walton, dressed in the 
garb of early 20th century educa
tor Mary McLeod Bethune, read

be as much of a problem as I thought, I said.
What about the Secret Service people who are guarding 
Clinton? I asked. What about them, theyre pretty disciplined 
about such things, he said, not seeing the problem. Well, dont 
take away their heroin, that might really tick them off, I said as 
a conversation closer.
Does anybody else see the problem here? If Im at my parents

thinking of what bush I can crawl under to smoke. And thats not 
even a high pressure situation.
Secret Service People know that they might die at any minute.

Ball 1993
Ball1rda
Ball entertained, but didnt meet the hype
By SUSAN F. ABRAMS
& TARA M. SEMAN
Tartan Contributing Editors
Absolutely the most insane event on campus this 
year.... Well, not quite.
But how could any event live up to all the hype 
that the Beaux Arts Ball was given this year? Its 
rather like your high school prom  you imagine 
that the event will be the best night of your life, and 
I then youre disappointed when it doesnt live up to 
B your expectations.
[ After attending the last Beaux Arts Ball in 
February ofl990, we both learned that we shouldnt 
I get our hopes up too high for events such as this. 
I And yet, we found ourselves doing it anyway. Call 
j us romanticsthis year, we envisioned an evening 
filled with glamour, glitz, and glory to put the 1990 
Ball to shame. But the evening of Noctuma 
Tempora seemed to hold only a glimmer of what 
was promised.
Not that everything was negative. Overall, the 
bands were pretty good, with a range from alterna
tive rock to grunge to reggae to punk to jazz to R&B 
to hard rock to rave. Everyone who was dancing 
seemed to be having a great time. The food was 
good, even if the dining places lacked the atmo
sphere promised in the program. Though many 
people dressed in semi-formal attire, there were 
quite a few creative costumes. But decorations and 
real theme areas? They were nowhere to be found.
In 1990, the building was lavishly decorated (not 
an easy task with a building the size of the College 
of Fine Arts). For instance, there were streamers, 
blow-up dolls, masks in a display case, and student 
artwork for Ballgoers to look at and chat about. 
Travelling entertainers such as jugglers and mu
sicians covered the floor. Many areas within the 
building were open to those who attended, includ
ing portions of the fourth floor. There were no 
elaborate themes underlying the overall 
Risorgimento theme for committee members to 
worry about. As a result, Ballgoers didnt have 
very high expectations for decorations. Actually, 
we didnt know what to expect as far as decorations 
went, but we were pleasantly surprised by the 
wide variety of artistic expression which rein
forced the rebirth and revival ideas behind 
Risorgimento. And when we got tired of walking 
around, there were plenty of places to sit back and 
relax throughout the building.
This year, Noctuma Tempora set itself up for 
a fall by announcing specific theme areas and not
decorating them accordingly. The Red Dragon 
Casino was the best of the lot with its real casino 
games and red walls, but the casino atmosphere 
itself just wasnt present in spite of the brightly 
colored chips. The name Red Dragon has a Far 
Eastern appeal, but that certain expected aura 
from the Orient simply did not exist.
The Red Dragon Speakeasy was in an adjoining 
room, a clever idea that kept casinogoers from 
going out into thehall every time they wanted 
a drink. But thats as clever as it could get.
While we realize that alcohol is forbidden 
at Beaux Arts because of potential dam
age to the building by intoxicated stu
dents, with a name like speakeasy, we 
were expecting more than serve-yourself 
Coke and Diet Coke in plastic pitchers.
Even a simple non-alcoholic punch would 
have been an improvement. There were only 
a few tables where you could sit 
and sip your 
drink, so most 
people had to 
take their 
drinks else
where. And 
again, 
the Red 
Dragon 
idea was not 
in sight.
While we have 
never been to 
a real speak
easy, we re
ally dont 
think this is 
the image that t h 
word conjures up.
Two doors down the hall was 
an attractive twist to the Ball: the Oc
cult Room. Here, Ballgoers had a chance to 
have their most pressing questions answered 
by the Tarot card and rune readers. Interest
ingly enough, the readings were done by CMU 
students. This room was quite popular despite 
the pseudo-atmosphere provided by the blue 
lights. Our guess is that everyone who entered 
the room paid attention only to the intriguing 
things the readers had to tell them.
The Mainstage, located in front of the CFA 
Deans Office, had great bands playing all night, 
but was poorly positioned. There was hardly any
room for students to walk from one end of the hall 
to the other, and a lot of pushing and shoving 
ensued to jet through the crowd listening to the 
music fron the foot of the stage to the staircase 
(about foil' rows). This presented a safety hazard 
not only bicause it was hard to get through and 
people were constantly tripping over light stands 
and wires, but also because some people were 
getting pushed onto the steps.
But all was not lost. If theres one thing any 
Beaux Arts Ball can count on year
at- ter year, its the
undying 
spirit of stu
dent cre
ativity. The 
costumes 
and ideas 
behind 
them wero 
as original
and 
varied 
as the 
musical 
groups 
who per
formed at the 
Ball.
Every masquerade 
party has its skeleton, 
and Nocturna 
Tempora had one 
that almost glowed in 
the dark. We passed by 
Vikings, vampires, jesters, 
sleepyheads, a spider, and a 
group of nuns. Some of the more 
widespread costumes circled 
around flapper and belly dancer 
outfits.
Famous characters included 
the Addams Family, an Aladdin 
look-alike, a candlestick named Lumiere from 
Beauty and the Beast, and two women dressed up 
as Eve, with little leaves and vines covering parts 
of thqir neutral-colored bodysuits.
Four people gave new meaning to the latest
fashion craze of platform shoes, as they showed up 
in cement block look-alikes one foot high tied to 
their feet. Glow-in-the-dark decal stars illumi
nated the dresses of two women, and one daring I 
young flasher had a two- or three-foot long limp 
penis dangling from the front of his black raincoat.
Many men dressed up as women, and at times it 
was difficult to determine the gender of anyone in 
a dress. And for those who insist that Elvis is dead, 
you missed another Elvis sighting: he came to the 
Ball  with a postage stamp frame around his 
neck! People who didnt even have a real costume" 
came with masks, many of which wero elaborately 
decoratod with brightly colored feathers or se
quins.
This year, about 600 tickets wero sold for tho 
Ball, compared to approximately 1200 tickets sold 
in 1990. We beliove the prico oftho tickots this year 
was definitely a factor that did not attract as many 
people as expected.
It is a costly operation to run, but ovon so, tho 
wholo ovoning did not seem to run up a bill of 
$32.50 per person. General decorations woro scarce, 
drinks woro sorely limitod, and themes woro not 
adequately played upon.
Perhaps it was a budget or planning problem or 
the preparation time was too constrainod (tho 
building did not close until 5 pm on Saturday, 
giving the committee loss than fivo hours to get 
everything together). But in spite of all tho criti
cism, the Ball was fun to go to, if only to laugh at 
other peoples costumes and hoar different kinds of 
music.
One big suggestion we have to mako tho next 
Beaux Arts Ball a real success is to have all the 
departments in CFA work together on it. Artists, 
designers, and architects can work on decorations 
or models as class projects that are clearly tied in 
with tho theme. Drama and music students could 
give mini-productions or presentations, also as 
part of a class project. While working for a class, 
all the students will still bo able to como together 
from their respective departments and have fun 
showing off their skills. This should also attract a 
larger audience, since more people who are not in 
the College of Fine Arts would want to see what; 
their friends have created or watch them perform.
Noctuma Tempora, or Times of the Night, 
was a great theme. The posters, tho advertise
ments, and even the ticket design promised an 
enchanting evening. But just a little more work 
would have made it even better than the best prom 
night when all your expectations are fulfilled.
Back room bands offered college-level sound
By MIKE SHAPIRO
Tartan Senior Staffwriter
The fever of performance surround
ing Beaux Arts is a contagious thing, 
urgingmany students to plugthe Elec
tric Something into an amp and flail 
sway. Two groups bitten by the Lets 
Jam bug last Saturday were Whole 
Cloth and Speaking Canaries; and 
while neither caused any second 
thoughts amongst the Grammy Award
Ramsey Hong/Tartan Art Editor
Committee, both were at least mildly 
amusing.
Both groups had the honor of playing 
on Stage Two, which is what is known 
by audio engineers as a smelly old 
room. As a result, the bands were 
challenged by an acoustic environment 
comparable to a cave full of fish, and 
sound quality was, shall we say, low.
Whole Cloth, an ad hoc group of mu
sicians from other bands, distinguished 
itself by including traditional instru
ments such as a cellos and woodwinds, 
which might as well have been kazoos 
for all you could hear of them.
The standard electric bass and guitar 
were reasonably well played, as were 
the drums. Also tossed 
into the works was an 
electric piano, and an in
strument best described 
as a boa constrictor with 
a mouthpiece.
The band focused pri
marily on interpretive 
covers, which is fine if 
you interpret Hava 
Nagila as needing a trom
bone part.
Most amusing ofthe set 
was an extended jam 
based on the theme to the 
Transformers commer
cial (you know, robots in 
disguise and all that).
Other highlights in
cluded a messy rendition 
of Rhinestone Cowboy
and a cover of Those Were the Days, 
My Friend, in which the two screech
ing vocalists brought new meaning to 
the lyric na.
While the boys howled kway, a group 
of projectors covered the far wall with 
excerpts from various PBS nature docu
mentaries and similar fare. There was 
no apparent connection between the 
films and music, other 
than, as one band membpr 
pointed out, both were 
written by other peoplei
One shouldnt be too 
harsh on Whole Cloth, 
since they held no 
pretentions about the ar
tistic level of their work.
As they put it, Were just 
here to have fun.
By contrast, the next act,
Speaking Canaries, had a 
bad case of taking them
selves a wee bit too seri
ously, ranking slightly be
low Congress.
On the upside, the Ca
naries were considerably 
more focused and tighter 
than the prior act, present
ing an array of somber 
metal tunes. The percus
sion in particular was ex
ceptionally well played.
However, technical fail
ures made the vocals in
audible, and the guitarist/ 
singers solution was to
crank up the PA and bombard the audi
ence with distortion. Earplugs came in 
handy here, reducing the sound inten
sity to a mere Way Too Loud. 
Perhaps in other circumstances, the 
Canaries would be a passable metal 
band, but at the BAB gig they served as 
one drawn-out, grimacing test of ampli
fication gear.
In short, college bands will be college 
bands, which is to say, pretty awful for 
the most part. But even the worst bands 
afford some level of entertainment value, 
and these two were far from the worst.
What can I say?
I hope that they at least had fun, and 
that practice does, somewhere down the 
line, make perfect.

L8The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  8 February 1993
Tar to perform at WRCT Winterblast next Saturday night
By MEGAN DIETZ
-KhtKr 1nrthTNCtTrb x7Ttnh
If you can get past chronically gray 
skies and people walking around with 
weird looks on their faces because theyre 
cold, there are some decent things about 
winter. Youve got your windless night
time snowfalls, basketball, and you can 
wear as many layers of clothing as you 
-want. If you add WRCTs Winterblast to 
this list, well, then, I dont see how you 
. have any right to bitch at all.
Winterblast is a yearly event in which 
WRCT brings to campus several buttcool bands that dont get a whole lot of 
airplay or exposure in our neck of the 
woods. BandB such as Pitchblende and 
Bunderblust have been featured in past 
' Winterblasts, and carrying the torch this 
.year are four groups contracted to make 
Skibo slide a few inches closer to Gesling 
. stadium  local groups Hurl, Donora, 
and Don Caballero, all of whom will
perform in support of Chicagos Tar, the 
headliners.
Tar, the headlining band, is a tight, 
loud, dense lil ball of guitar noise, drum 
pound, and bass thump rolled in a 
coarsely chopped layer of vocals. The 
band is heavy and thunderous, but not 
unwieldly  their rhythms are tight, 
their riffs kinetic, and their intensity 
contagious. I imagine after a few tunes, 
everyone in the house will be grimacing 
and stomping around the room like 
theyre really pissed off at least thats 
what I do whenever I listen to the tape at 
home.
After releasing several singles and 
two full-length effortB  znCr7SnCav 
and dKpeanr  on the Amphetamine 
Reptile label (a label they shared with 
similarly-minded bands like Helmet, 
Surgery, and the Cows), Tar switched to 
Touch & Go last year. The band has two 
seven-inch cuts out on Touch & Go bo 
far, and an EP entitled 1kTrpSvh will
come put in March.
The/ performed last fall at the Bee
hive '/ith Touch & Go brethren The 
Jesus Lizard, and, according to bassist 
Tom ialuckyj, the band is more than 
ready K shake the dirt off of CMU next 
week.
Zaluckyj says that he finds himBelf at 
a loss when he tries to describe Tars 
musicjbut inadvertently gives a glimpse 
of the bands aesthetic anyway in attempti ig to explain why. I dont really 
have a smooth way of doing it, he says. 
I doni like categorizing music, because 
people always try to put labels on us. I 
guess Id just call it Tar music, because 
we dort really try to sound like any
body. Ve dont want to sound like any
body.
"Basically what we try to do is play 
music that makes us happy. If we like it, 
thats fine. If anyone else likes it, thats 
better even. We dont have a particular 
crowd in mind when we play. Were not
thinking about money. If a songs going 
to be a hit, thats great. But its no big 
deal either way.
He Bays their move from Amphet
amine Reptile to Touch & Go (both inde
pendents) is an example of this noncapitalistic drive. The idea of being on a 
major label, for our band, is ridiculous. 
We dont really like what they stand for, 
so to speak, says Zaluckyj. You lose 
control of what youre doing.... For us, 
being on Touch & Go is like being on a 
major label without being on a major 
label. They promote us, they give us help 
if we ask for it, but other that that, we 
just do our own thing.
Zaluckyj is ready to hit the road, along 
with guitarist/vocalist John Mohr, drum
mer Mike Greenlees, and guitarist Mark 
Zablocki. Tourings great, says 
Zaluckyj, but its got its ups and downs. 
I mean, you get to play every night, and 
you meet a lot of people, which is really 
fun. But... you see the same three peopleNuns consider values in new student qpera
all the time. We all get along fine, but by 
the end of it we really dont want to see 
each other for a few days. Theyll be 
more people on this tour, though, so it 
wont be a big problem.
The more people hes talking about 
belong to Washington, D.C.s Jawbox, 
who will meet up with Tar in a few 
weeks for a joint tour of the east coast 
and the Midwest, supporting their re
cent split single, in which each band did 
a cover of the others song (both of which 
are called Static).
Sounds pretty cool, huh? If youre 
wringing your hands, wondering how 
you can be a part of Winterblast, well, 
just chill out a minute. All you need to do 
is pay $5 ($6 without CMU ID) and show 
up at the Wherrett Room next Sunday at
7 pm. And, its Valentines Day, so bring 
your honey if you have one and your 
pent-up frustrations if you dont. And 
bring some earplugs, because the place 
is going to pound like nobodys business.

Would you be willing to sacri
fice your life for the beliefs you 
. hold most dear? This is the sub
ject offTKknbCva n_ tSv 1KhPvkTtvaM 
the newest opera presented by 
CMUs Department of Music. The 
opera, by Francis Poulenc (based 
on the play by Georges Bernanos),
 describes the persecution of the 
Carmelite convent during the 
French Revolution.
The nuns are forced to abandon 
their convent by the revolution, ary regime, but they secretly take 
a vow of martyrdom, offering their 
lives for the salvation of their 
order and of their country.
The opera also tells the story of 
Blanche de la Force (played by 
junior music major Theodora 
-Fried), a young woman who joins 
-the Carmelite convent as the 
Revolution begins, and whose 
inner faith is constantly chal
lenged by her fear of death.
Chatham Colleges chapel is a 
fitting location for this spiritual 
; drama. Surrounded by religious 
! symbols, seated on church pews,
! the audience is subconsciously 
 drawn into the atmosphere of the 
; opera before the first act even 
 begins.
j The opening scene introduces 
I the audience to Blanche, shortly 
i after her carriage has been 
22 stopped by a mob of angry peas ants. As her father and brother 
_ anxiously await her return home 
{ and debate the effects this dis! turbing event will have on her 
"Blanche, slowly makes her en
trance.
C The entrance is startling; Fried, 
.as Blanche, glides across the stage 
like one in a trance, her face pale 
and frightened as if she had come 
face to face with a demon. This 
simple trance foreshadows the 
struggle Blanche will face 
throughout the opera: her battle 
to confront death with courage
and religious faith.
In the next scene, Blanche vis
its the Carmelite convent and 
meets with the Mother Superior 
there. Graduate music student 
Deborah Bletstein gives an in
credible perfomance as the ailing 
Mother Superior. Her death 
scene, at the end of Act One, is 
extremely powerful, as the 
Mother Superior questions her 
faith and declares that God has 
abandoned the Carmelites, see
ing a vision of their convent des
ecrated.
Act Two contains a moving duet 
between Blanche and her brother, 
the Chevalier de la Force (Dillon 
McCartney). The Chevalier 
pleads with Blanche, asking that 
she leave the convent and return 
home to stay with their father. 
Blanche resists his efforts to de
stroy her loyalty to the order. She 
resents the way he attempts to 
undermine her faith by treating 
her like a naive child. This scene 
is pivotal for Blanches character 
because it is the first test of her 
committment to the Carmelites.
In Act Three, the nuns take 
their vow of martyrdom, having 
been told of a legislative decree 
stating that all religious orders 
were to be dissolved. They are 
urged to this vow by Mother 
Marie, in the absence of their 
new Mother Superior. Senior 
music majorValerie Komar gives
a convincing performance as the 
strong and slightly! fanatical 
Mother Marie.
The final scene of tne opera is 
by far the most poweiful, as the 
nuns, having been convicted of 
conspiracy against tht republic,
are led, one by one, to
tine. The staging of this scene is
ihe guilloarmelites 
he chapel
very effective; the 
enter from the rear of 
and approach up the isles. The 
actual beheading is done offstage, 
so the audience only sees the char
acters bravely striding towards 
their demise. The result of this is 
that it is- the courage of the 
Carmelites, not their deaths, that 
the audience remembers.
There were a few technical dif
ficulties with the sound. Acous
tics differed as the players moved 
around on the stage, faking it 
difficult to understand the dia
logue. Also, while the orchestra 
was fantastic, there were a few 
places where they overpowered 
the singers. However, thise small 
problems did not take away from 
the overall effect of the opera. .

also be playing on February 12, 
13, and 14 at the Chatham Col

Pigface Fook Me 93 tour well worth it
By BRENDAN McFEELY
-KhtKr x7TtnhyTry1STv_
Last Monday night, in an explosion of indus
trial sound, Invisible Records supergroup Pigface 
brought its Fook Me 93 tour to Graffiti, along 
with opening act Lab Report.
The sonic assault began at 8:45 pm, as Lab 
Report took the stage to create the droning, earsplitting feedback that is their brand of music. 
Aided by the judicious application of weirdly 
distorted and looped vocals, Lab Report frontman 
Matt Schultz mesmerized the audience with the 
incredible sound put out by his self-designed 
Assault Tactical Guitar (ATG), a several-foot 
long contraption that he manipulated into pro
ducing a screamingly loud factory-like drone, 
which served neatly in lieu of percussion for
most of L'ab Reports short set.
The crowd mellowed out quite a bit during the 
hypnotic opening setsome even took seats on 
the dance floor. However, the fans jumped im
mediately into motion when Martin Atkins, 
Pigfaces percussionist, took the stage and began 
pounding away at his drum set from behind a 
screen. The crowd went wild as the rest of the 
band took the stage and began a musical free-forall.
Most songs performed come from the latest 
Pigface album, OnneM which was released late 
last year. Some of these suffered from lack of 
Chris Connelly, well-known for his performing 
with Ministry. Connelly, whose vocals are a key 
part of several of the better tracks on OnneM was 
replaced by Atkins, Hope Nicholls of Fetchin 
Bones, and En Esch of German band KMFDM. 
Another much-missed contributor was Skinny 
Puppys Ogre, who lent a great deal of vocal 
craziness to both Onne and the previous Pigface 
album 5CNB However, those who were present, 
including Atkins, Nicholls, Schultz of Lab Re
port, Paul Raven of Killing Joke, Esch, William 
Tucker of My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult, and

Attention all 
Resident Students!
The Room Reservation 
Process for 1993-94 is coming
soon!
The Room Reservation process for the 1993-94 academic year 
will be held during the first two weeks in March.
All students who wish to be considered for university housing 
for the 1993-94 academic year must pay a $100 deposit between 
February 3 and February 25,1993. The deposit should be paid at the 
Cashier's office in Warner Hall. It is important that you save your 
receipt for the deposit because you must show it in order to 
participate in the room reservation process.
If a resident wishes to designate a student who is not 
currently living in the residence halls as a roommate, that 
designated roommate must also pay a $100 housing deposit. Those 
students not currently living in university housing who wish to 
reserve a room must come to the Housing Office in Morewood 
Gardens to pick up a deposit slip before they make their deposit.
It is important to note that all room reservations are for the 
entire academic year. Students who reserve rooms in university 
housing must sign a housing license agreement for that space. They 
will not be able to break their contracts and move out during the 
year. Those students who are interested in moving off campus 
should speak with the Off-Campus Community Housing 
Coordinator, Norma Shaw, whose office is located in Morewood 
Gardens, across from the Housing Office.
A brochure which describes the room reservation process and 
details the dates, days, and times will be distributed in the residence 
halls. Additional copies of this brochure are in the Housing Office.
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact the 
Housing Office at x2139.

Golem/F aust/Nosferatu
Been waiting for a fun-filled evening of silent 
German expressionist films from the 1920s? This 
may be your lucky week. As a matter of fact, youll 
get three for the price of one, all by critically 
acclaimed German filmmakers.
The Golem (How He Came Into the World), di
rected by Paul Wegener, stars Wegener as the 
Golem, an ancient clay figure from Hebrew mythol
ogy that becomes animated by a magic word that 
means truth in Hebrew. The clay-man roams 
through Prague in a Frankenstein-ish atmosphere 
created by the camerawork of Karl Freund.
Director F.W. Mumau brings us Faust, the leg
endary story of Faust. Gosta Ekman plays Faust 
and Emil Jannings plays the Devil.
Another of Mumaus films, Nosferatu, consid
ered by critics to be a milestone in the history of 
world cinema, is an early version of the better 
known Dracula. Features Max Schreck as one of 
the ugliest vampires ever, along with an unequaled 
eerie atmosphere.
At 6, 8, and 10 pm.
Friday, February 12
Bram Stokers Dracula
Following in the tradition of Thursdays gothic 
horror theme, this movie brings us a more contem
porary film about the classic vampire tale.
This version, directed by Francis Ford Coppola, 
is based on Bram Stokers 1897 novel and tells the 
tale of the Transylvanian princes journey to find 
his lost love. Gary Oldman portrays a melancholy, 
brooding Dracula who tries to seduce Mina, the 
reincarnation ofhis human lover, played by Wynona 
Rider. Battling the vampire are Anthony Hopkins, 
who portrays a spiritualist doctor, and KeanuReeves 
as Minas fianc.
Draculas gothic atmosphere draws the audience 
into a stylized, but bold, rendition of the classic tale. 
Coppolas illusionary visuals offer a disorientingly 
mystical and erotic experience.
At 5:45, 8,10:15 pm, and 12:30 am.
Saturday, February 13
The Last of the Mohicans
Director Michael Mann brings us an intriguing 
adaptation of the James Fenimore Cooper novel. 
Daniel Day-Lewis plays Hawkeye, a white man 
who is adopted by a Native American named 
Chingachgook (played by Russell Means) at the age 
of two or three.
The movie is set during the French and Indian 
War, during which Hawkeye and his family rescue 
Cora (Madeleine Stowe) and Alice Munro (Jodhi 
May), two British sisters, from Native Americans 
working for the French, who try to ambush the two 
women en route to their fathers post. Cora becomes 
attracted to Hawkeye, and Alice to Hawkeyes 
adopted brother Uncas. Their romantic relation
ships are a main focus of the film.
Along with beautiful cinematography, this film 
offers a particularly strong and self-sufficient char
acter in Cora, who is able to defend both herself and 
her sister in battle.
At 5:45, 8,10:10 pm, and 12:20 am.
Sunday, February 14
