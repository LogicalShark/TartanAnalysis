Dominos Pizza 
delivers refunds
By LESLIE ZUBATY
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Students are complaining that Dominos 
Pizza isnt living up to its advertised 30 minute 
limit, and not offering the promised $3 dis
count when late. They are apparently un
aware that the guarantee does not apply to 
campus deliveries.
If a pizza is late to a customer ordering from 
a CMU meal plan, Dominos will provide cou
pons for free sodas or extra toppings.
During meal periods, it is nearly impossible 
for Dominos to deliver as quickly as usual 
because of the large number of orders they 
receive, according to Roger N. Heydt, associ
ate director of Dining Services. [The dinner 
rush] also poses unsafe conditions for the 
drivers, to ask them to deliver at such a fast 
pace, explains Heydt.
The biggest problem Dominos faces is deal
ing with students who try to beat the system, 
said Heydt. He asks students not to try to 
order more than one meal in a single meal 
period because it creates complications for 
Dominos employees and slows production.
Except for the complaints, Dominos first 
year on the meal plan has been extremely 
successful. Dining Service reports that 4000 
students placed pizza orders last week, and 
that Dominos has delivered to over 12,000 so 
far this fall. Freshman industrial manage
ment major Tim Murphy and sophomore elec
trical and computer engineering major John 
DiCosola agree that Dominos is a good alter
native. DiCosola comments, "At the very 
least, it's the same every time and it's cool to 
get it on the meal plan."It works!!
The clock, which confused many students by showing the wrong time until early last week, is back in working order now that its new gears have arrived.

The TclTco
CMUs ranking falls
By MEGAN DIETZ
Tartan Contributing Editor
Carnegie Mellon ranks 24th 
in the new U.S. News and World 
Report 1992 guide to the best 
universities in America, which 
ranks the top 25 schools in sev
eral categories. CMUs ranking 
of 24th among national univer
sities reflects a two-place drop 
from last years rating.
The ranks are determined by 
first rating each school in five
categories: academic reputation, 
student selectivity, faculty re
sources, financial resources, and 
student satisfaction. Each of 
these scores is given a weight 
and applied to the total score as 
follows: financial resources, 20 
percent, student satisfaction 5 
percent, and 25 percent each for 
the other three criteria. Rank
ing for each category is deter
mined as a percentile of the top 
score in that category  that 
includes the final scores, which
are determined as a percentile 
of the score of the top school, 
which, for the second year in a 
row, is Harvard University.
CMU ranks in the top 20 in 
only one of the five criteria, fi
nancial resources, where it 
placed 15th. Academic reputa
tion and faculty resources came 
in at 24th and 23rd place, re
spectively. CMUs scores in the 
final two criteria, however, are 
at the bottom of the list. In stu

The difficulties and concerns 
of many undergrads are being 
addressed by a new program set 
up by alumni relations. Inter
ested students are able to meet 
those who have successfully 
weathered the storm of competi
tion and achievement: the CMU 
alumni.
As part of a renewed and enor
mous attention to the under
graduates, says Steve Calvert,
Associate Vice President for 
Development and Director of 
Alumni Realtions, Carnegie 
Mellon graduates are able to 
serve as mentors to those stu
dents looking to meet members 
of former classes familiar with 
the rigors of their major. Or, 
continued Calvert, there are 
those who are interested in build
ing relationships that are clearly 
more far-reaching than mentormentee.
The Alumni Mentorship Pro
gram was officially warmed-up
last Monday in the Skibo Ball
room when undergraduates of
ficially met their mentors. Par
ticipants mingled with local 
CMU alumni from graduating 
classes spanning over 30 years. 
The level of buzzing in the room 
was amazing, said Calvert, In 
pairs and in fours people were 
finding out how much they share 
and how much they have in com
mon.
The kick off marked the real
ization of a dream of under
graduate support sparked by
Associate Director of Alumni 
Relations Tammy Hale, who was 
unavailable for comment due to 
the birth of her second child. 
Over a year ago, Hale and a 
small group of concerned mem
bers of the Alumni Relations 
Department met with both stu
dents and potential mentors to 
explore possible answers to the 
question of undergraduate sup
port. According to Calvert,We 
asked mentors what they ex
pected from students and stu
dents what they needed from
their mentors. What Hale and 
her group found was a need for a 
highly specific interaction be
tween graduates and students 
which could be born only of cer
tain working friendships. 
Academic advising is a rela
tively easy and common thing, 
says Calvert. Thats not what 
most undergr ads need in the first 
year and a half, Calvert points 
out that Hale envisions a much 
more personal relationship 
which is geared to answer ques
tions of change, challenge and
personal adjustment in general. 
The key here is that the pro
gram is individualized. Some
times there really is no academic 
link.
Hale attempted careful 
matches between the interests 
and majors of the undergrads to 
the professions of the alumni. 
Originally, continues Calvert, 
We were dealing with about 50 
more students than mentors, 
and we matched accordingly. 
The day of the kick-off, however,

Community Literacy Center opens
By MATT BUSHEY
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Carnegie Mellons Center for 
the Study of Writing and Lit
eracy and the Community House 
on Union Avenue will officially 
open the Community Literacy 
Center (CLC) on Friday, Octo
ber 4.
A joint effort between CMU 
and the Pittsburgh community, 
the Community Literacy Center 
aims to improve and broaden 
the use of writing and communi
cation skills among teenagers. 
According to Dr. Linda Flower, 
President of the Board of Direc
tors of the CLC, The idea is to 
work with real urban high school 
students, involving them in com
munity projects that revolve
around writing.
The Center consists of three 
projects which involve high 
school students in the commu
nity while exposing them to new 
literacy practices. The students 
work on a community project 
relying heavily on the writing 
processes involved. Another pro
gram in the planning stage is a 
student mentor program. The 
program would encourage CMU 
students and alumni to work 
with the teenagers.
Junior creative writing major 
Doug Smith volunteered to be a 
mentor for the program. Its an 
easy way to gain access to work
ing with kids, said Smith. I 
was thinking about my high 
school years and how I knew a 
lot of people who had a lot of
trouble with writing.
The Community Literacy Cen
ter is located in the Community 
House at 801 Union Avenue on 
the east side of the Allegheny 
Center Mall. The Community 
House has been serving Pitts
burgh for over 75 years. Accord
ing to Flower, One of the con
nections that has been really 
good for us in this collaboration 
is the link between the Commu
nity House and the Center for 
the Study of Writing and Lit
eracy at Carnegie Mellon. 
Although the Center will be 
formally opened on October 4, 
pilot projects have already been 
implemented over the past three 
years. The Housing Empower
ment and Literacy Program, or

THIS JUST IN.,.
Virus may cause CFS
Sept. 24 (DJ)  A growing body of 
evidence suggests that a virus or some 
other physiological agent  and not 
psychiatric trouble  is a cause of the 
mysterious ailment known as chronic 
fatigue syndrome (CFS).
Researchers who met last weekend 
in Atlanta said one of at least four 
different viruses could be a cause of the 
syndrome. None has yet emerged as a 
leading prospect and there is no assur
ance that any of them will be shown to 
cause the illness. But the number of 
candidates is viewed as bolstering the 
case that some identifiable agent un
derlies the illness.
Meanwhile, a study published Satur
day in Lancet, a British medical jour
nal, found that many chronic fatigue 
patients, particularly those with se
vere symptoms, suffer from immune 
system irregularities that could pro
voke many characteristics of the ill
ness.
An official at the U.S. Center for
Disease Control in Atlanta said data 
collected in the agencys study of chronic 
fatigue are consistent with a physical 
cause for the ailment.
The syndrome is marked by severe 
fatigue, muscle and joint pain, and of
ten by cognitive and neurological im
pairments such as loss of balance and 
trouble adding and subtracting. Such 
symptoms resemble those of many other 
illnesses, and they vary widely from 
patient to patient.
Some scientists and physicians be
lieve an infectious agent such as a virus 
causes the illness, but many others 
think psychological or other yet-to-beidentified problems cause the symp
toms.
Finding a physical cause would be a 
major breakthrough in efforts to im
prove diagnosis, develop treatments, 
and determine whether the syndrome 
is contagious and how it might spread. 
It would also give both patients and 
researchers more credibility in the
medical community, where chronic fa
tigue continues to face high levels of 
skepticism.
One of the major problems with this 
disease is having it believed, says Jay 
A. Levy, a researcher at University of 
California at San Francisco and princi
pal investigator for the research just 
published in Lancet.
Viruses already reside in most people 
but are held at bay by the immune 
system.
But research by Levy and Dr. Nancy 
Klimas, an immunologist at the Uni
versity of Miami School of Medicine, 
shows that chronic fatigue sufferers 
have abnormal immune systems that 
may fail to clear the body of invading 
viruses or to prevent reactivation of 
latent ones.
That raises the question of whether 
they are a cause or effect of chronic 
fatigue, Klimas said. These data dont 
compel one to think this is a psychiatric 
illness.
Saudis request Patriot missiles
WASHINGTON, Sept. 24 (AP,)The U.S. will send nearly 
100 Patriot missiles and around 1,300 troops to Saudi Arabia, 
a senior Pentagon official said.
The missiles will depart from Germany, said an official who 
spoke on condition of anonymity.
Theyre getting ready to go now, said the official.
President Bush said last week that he would provide the 
missiles to the Saudis for defensive purposes.
The Saudis requested the weapons as tensions heated in the 
Persian Gulf region in the wake of Iraqi President Saddam 
Hussein:-' refusal to cooperate with United Nations weapons 
inspectors.
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Iraq still 
possessed several hundred Scud missiles of the type used 
against Saudi Arabia during the Gulf War.
Bush also made it clear that he was willing to send war
planes back into the Gulf if necessary to allow the United 
Nations inspectors to go about their business.
The Pentagon official said that the U.S. contingent will 
consist of two Patriot missile battalions. Each battalion will 
have 48 missiles and will be accompanied by 690 soldiers.
The Pentagon announced last week that it intended to make 
the weapons available from its stock. The number and the
timing of the deployment, however, remained uncertain.
There were reports that the Saudis demanded the mis
siles in return for allowing the United States to stage 
protective cover flights for the United Nations inspectors 
in Iraq, but Pentagon officials declined to comment on the 
reports.
Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said that the anti
missile weapons were requested by King Fahd of Saudi 
Arabia because the Saudis feel threatened by Iraq.
He said the Saudis expressed concern because Baghdad 
continues to try to sidestep the United Nations Security 
Council resolutions on destroying their ballistic missiles.
The Pentagon has said repeatedly that Iraq has a long 
way to go in meeting its post-Gulf War agreement to 
disclose the full range of its chemical, biological, and 
nuclear weapons programs, as well as the extent of its 
ballistic missile program.
Last week, Williams said the Patriot deployment had 
symbolic as well as protective value.
This is a deterrent to make clear to our friends and to the 
Iraqis that the United States is prepared to do whatever is 
necessary to defend its interests and the interests of the 
allies in the region, Williams said.
Thomas nomination 
encounters setback
WASHINGTON, Sept. 27 (AP)  
The Senate Judiciary Committee 
deadlocked 7 to 7 on Clarence Tho
mas nomination to the Supreme 
Court, then sent the appointment to 
the full Senate for a final vote.
All six Republicans joined Demo
crat Dennis DeConcini in voting for 
Thomas, a conservative appeals court 
judge who would be the second black 
to sit on the high court following the 
retirement of Thurgood Marshall 
from the Supreme Court.
The Committees seven other 
Democrats opposed him. Senator 
Paul Simon (D-ffl.), was the lone ab
stention in this move.
No vote by the full Senate is pos
sible before Thursday, giving oppo
nents and supporters time to mar
shal more support for the showdown.
A leading supporter, a prominent 
opponent, and President Bush all pre
dicted Thomas would eventually be 
confirmed for the seat.
Itll be all right, Bush told re
porters at the White House.
Judge Thomas spent five days 
running away from his record, said 
Senator Howard Metzenbaum, the 
Ohio Democrat who was one of Tho
mas most vocal critics.
Said Senator Strom Thurmond (RS.C.), Theres been no confirmation 
conversion.
The 7 to 7 tie was sealed by conser
vative Democratic Senator Howell 
Heflins announcement Thursday 
that he would oppose Thomas, and by 
a similar announcement by Senator 
Joseph Biden, the Delaware Demo
crat who is chairman of the Senate 
Judiciary Committee.
Biden said he would not support 
any effort to block a vote by the full 
Senate on the nomination. In a speech 
to the Senate shortly before he con
vened the Judiciaiy Committee, he 
said his own decision to oppose the 
nomination was a close call.
I will not vote to confirm Judge 
Thomas, Biden said. It is not a de
cision I came to lightly.
Biden said before the vote that 
under the Senates rules, a 7 to 7 vote 
could kill the nomination. He as
sured Danforth that he would not 
hold to that rule, and also said he 
would not support a filibuster and 
knows of no move by opponents to 
stage one.
Danforth, responding, said he 
hoped the Senate could take up the 
nomination by the middle of next 
week, no matter what the vote in 
todays Judiciary Committee meet
ing.
Heflin, in remarks made yester
day, predicted Thomas will win con
firmation by the full Senate. But, he 
said Thomas "might be part of the 
right-wing extremist movement;
Iraq-U.N. standoff ends
DoT unveils airline noise standards
WASHINGTON, Sept. 24 (AP)  
Transportation Secretary Samuel K. 
Skinner launched a drive to hush the 
nations loudest jets by the end of the 
decade, without severely disrupting 
airline finances.
Skinner issued new noise reduction 
regulations that gave airlines the flex
ibility they had asked for, while prom
ising more peace in the new century for 
most of the nearly 3 million Americans
now exposed regularly to high levels of 
jet noise.
Skinner also issued new standards 
that will make it more difficult for indi
vidual airports and communities to is
sue more restrictive noise rules.
James B. Busey, head of the Federal 
Aviation Administration, said this was 
necessary to avoid disrupting the air
line industry and to reduce the noise 
in a standard way so that it will not be
simply pushed to another area.
The new airport noise-reduction rule 
proposed by Transportation Secretary 
Skinner will require the replacement 
or quieting of more than 2,200 of the 
nations loudest jet aircraft by the year 
2000. Foreign airlines flying into the 
United States also will be required to 
meet the new noise standard.
Eventually the consumer will pay 
for it, Skinner said.
NICOSIA, Cyprus, Sept. 27 (AP)  
David Kay, the American head of the 
United Nations nuclear inspection team 
that has been detained in a Baghdad 
parking lot for four days, said that the 
standoff was over.
The siege is officially over as of seven 
minutes ago when Iraqi soldiers be
gan pulling back, Kay said on CNN at 
about 1 am Saturday (5 pm EDT).
The agreement reached is exactly 
what we came here for, said Kay, whose 
team has been inspecting documents 
relating to Iraqs nuclear program un
der the terms of the United Nations 
cease-fire ending the Gulf War.
We have full control over the docu
ments, all the videotapes, he said.
For four days, the 44-member United 
Nations team had been surrounded by 
scores of Iraqi troops in a parking lot 
outside the Iraqi Atomic Energy ComThe United Nations and Iraq came to 
an agreement that detailed, to the Ira
qis the contents of all materials.
The showdown began Tuesday, after 
the Iraqis demanded the inspectors turn 
over documents detailing Iraqs secret 
nuclear program.
When inspectors refused to give up 
the documents to Iraqi troops, the stand
off began with the army surrounding 
the building.
Later, supporters of Iraqi President 
Saddam Hussein rallied around the 
building in protest of the United Na
tions inspections.

ALUMNI, from page 1
many of the registered students 
failed to attend and many ne
glected to sign-up with the 
matches which were already 
completed. Most of the diffi
culty was mathematical; sched
uling and the like. We ended up 
having more mentors than stu
dents, so we began to assign 
randomly.
Despite early difficulties, 
Calvert estimates that nearly 
80 students paired happily 
with mentors simply by random. 
Only about 15% of the students 
attending requested different 
mentorsusually within their 
majorsand we are still work
ing on accomodating them.
I am truly certain that 
Tammys dream is coming true, 
says Calvert, It was clear to me 
that, from just the first meeting, 
both student and mentor wanted 
relationships that went beyond
the academic. Calvert has 
headed similar programs at 
Dartmouth and is confident that, 
with CMUs local alumni popu
lation of over 13,000, the well 
will never run dry. In effect, 
says Calvert, the mentors feel 
as if they are gaining a family 
member and the students have 
a new relative they can turn to 
for just about anything.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  30 September 19915
Community Literacy Center sponsors three new programs
LITERACY, from page 1
HELP Project, involves teenag
ers in neighborhood improve
ment projects. Over the sum
mer, teens planned and built an 
outdoor courtyard for a senior 
citizens center.
The Write Project deals with 
other social problems. Over the
past few years, a team of high 
school students studied the is
sue of teen pregnancy. Their re
search resulted in a pamphlet 
published by teens for teens on 
the issue.
The third project is the Argue 
Project, which allows commu
nity groups to come together in a
forum and discuss community 
problems. Aimed towards adults, 
the Argue Project encourages 
community groups to solve prob
lems through literacy. For ex
ample, a group of landlords and 
tenants will use this project to 
draft a memorandum of under
standing between the two par
ties.
All of the Community Literacy 
Center projects focus on the use 
of writing in the community. 
According to Flower, the goal of 
the Center is to be a place for 
people in the community to use 
writing as a tool to help deal 
with community issues.
Disney Studios has also ex
pressed an interest in the Com
munity House. Disney surveyed 
the historic Community House 
building and decided to film part 
of a movie there. In exchange for 
the use of the building, the teens 
who are involved in the program 
were given an opportunity to be
a part of the set with the possi
bility of being extras in the 
movie. Smith will advise the 
teens on this project and will be 
on the movie set himself.
The Center will hold an out
door opening ceremony from 3 to 
5 pm at the Community House 
on Friday, October 4.
Carnegie Mellon stripped of rank
RANKINGS, from page 1
dent selectivity, CMU earned 
53rd place, the lowest rank of all 
schools in the top 25. And, be
sides UCLA, who ranks 65th in 
student satisfaction, CMU again 
rounds out the bottom end of the 
list, coming in 47th place.
Other statistics are listed 
along with the rankings. These 
include acceptance rate, in which 
CMU is the highest  the least 
selective  on the list at 65 
percent; graduation rate, where 
CMU is second to the lowest 
with 69 percent; average SAT 
score, where CMU is in the 
middle with 1225; and fresh
man retention rate, where CMU 
appears at the bottom again with 
only 87 percent of freshmen re
turning for their sophomore 
year.
The nature of CMU and its 
colleges explains some of these 
rankings. For example, each col
lege has a different acceptance
rate. For 1990, CFA had the 
lowest with 45 percent, while 
H&SS accepted 91 percent of its 
applicants. Because of the cuts 
policy of some departments 
within CFA, it has the lowest 
graduation rate at 63 percent 
for the 1989-1990 school year. 
And since SAT scores are not as 
important as talent in admis
sion of CFA students, SATs of 
CFA students are, on the aver
age, lower than those of stu
dents in other colleges, though 
not by a wide margin.
From those schools who placed 
in the top 25 last year, the two 
surpassing CMU this year were 
Northwestern University (23rd 
last year, 14th this year) and
nBBEEBBBS-1. Would you Ilk to work for yourttlf?2. Would you Rk* tout your own hour?3. Are you If-motivated?4. Are you a HI of an ntrepre nu r?

Washington University (24th 
last year, 18th this year). CMU 
moved ahead of the University 
of North Carolina at Chapel Hill 
(20th last year, 25th this year).
The only statistic which has 
changed appreciably from the 
last report is student satisfac
tion, which dropped from 27 to 
47 in the last year. Since last 
year, CMUs acceptance rate has 
remained steady (64 percent last 
year, 65 percent now). The 
graduation rate, however, has 
dropped by eight percentage 
points, and the facultyto-student ratio has gone from 7:1 to 
9:1. The total spending per stu
dent has risen from $33,607 last 
year to $40,844 this year.

If you depend on your computer to 
be more than a word processer, graduat
ing to a NeXTstation" computer may be 
the smartest course you ever take.
While we cant promise a NeXTsta
tion will carry you all the way through 
college in a month, we can promise it 
will carry you all the way through col
lege. And graduate school. And, pardon 
the expression, the real world.
GRADUATE IN 
OCTOBER.
Thats because no other desktop 
computer brings such a full suite of 
workstation features to bear on such a 
wide range of research, analysis, report 
writing, and problem solving tasks.
Features like a high-performance 15 
MIPS CPU, a minimum of 8 MB of 
RAM and 105 MB of hard disk storage, 
a full UNIX operating system, true 
multitasking, 3D graphics, and built-in 
Ethernet networking.
And no other desktop computer sur
rounds this much power with the easyto-use graphical interface  and the 
easy-to-live-with price  of a personal 
computer.
With the right software, its all the 
computer any college student needs.
And between August 15 and October 
31, well make acquiring the right soft
ware practically painless.
Buy any NeXT' CPU between now 
and then and get WordPerfect? the pre
mier word processor, SoftPC? the ATclass MS-DOS*emulator, and DiagramP, 
the powerful drawing and diagramming 
package, for less than $300. Thats near
ly $1400 worth of the most popular pro
ductivity tools available for less than 
$300 bucks.
Whats more, graduating to a NeXT 
computer doesnt require a lot of prereq
uisites. Just a visit to a campus reseller.
And nows the time to do it.
Because the sooner you 
graduate, the easier college 
will become.

Suggested alcohol 
policy threatens rights
Editor:
In last weeks Tar
tan, Paul Mitchell 
voiced his opinion on 
the IFCs steps to 
make fraternities so
cial activities safer and more respon
sible [CMU must take strong stance 
on alcohol policy, 9/23]. As his solu
tion, he proposed empowering CMUs 
police to give random, on-the-spot 
breathalyzer tests to anyone on cam
pus. The only mention of the legal 
implications of this policy he gives is 
that statement, This is not a violation 
of privacy; these same methods are 
used upon adults by officers of the law.
Perhaps Mitchell would benefit from 
a brief review of Constitutional law, 
and more specifically, the implementa
tion of the unreasonable search and 
seizure clause in society today. While 
it is true that police officers are allowed 
to give breathalyzer tests to motorists 
they suspect of drunk driving, not even 
in the most 'conservative areas of 
America has the notion of random 
breathalyzer tests in order to protect 
society from those walking while in
toxicated been introduced, not to men
tion implemented. Secondly, CMU po
lice are not officers of the law, but 
officers of CMU policy, which basically 
disqualifies Mitchells argument from 
the start.
Equally as frightening as Mitchells 
disregard for the Bill of Rights, is his 
ignorance of the policy-making struc
ture of the CMU Greek system, one 
which I believe works quite effectively. 
Without it, CMU students might actu
ally be faced with policies as dangerous 
as the one Mr. Mitchell proposes.

three weeks. First, let L6tt6f tO 
me update you on the Frli+nr
current status of the UIC cu,iur
Student Government initiatives.
The first newsletter was sent to the 
participants of the Student Mentor 
Program, reiterating the goals of this 
initiative. Through Activities Boards 
generosity, a limited number of free 
seats to the movies will be available for 
those involved in the program on Thurs
days, Fridays, and Sundays. Further, a 
Happy Hour has been scheduled for 
Wednesday, October 3. Shortly after 
the midsemester break, we will con
duct an interim program evaluation 
session.
As for the discussion forum proposal, 
we are coordinating our efforts with 
Student Affairs on the Gathering Store 
series, a program designed to provide 
an opportunity for constructive discus
sions. The first Gathering Store will 
take place on Wednesday, October 16 
at 4:30 pm in Breed Hall, Margaret 
Morrison 103. It will discuss various 
implications of technological develop
ments as they relate to our society. I
strongly encourage all of you to attend.
The Student Government Steering 
Committee will soon decide on the best 
approaches to implement the Depart
mental Information Fair and Student/ 
Faculty Interactive Programs. I will 
keep you updated.
This is a very exciting week in many 
ways. First and the foremost, this is the 
Homecoming Week; I urge all of you to 
get excited and participate in the wide 
variety of activities taking place this 
week. Next, on Wednesday, October 2, 
at 4:30 pm in the Skibo Ballroom, Presi
dent Robert Mehrabian will address 
the campus. Also present will be the 
new Vice Provost for Education, Dr. 
Erwin Steinberg, to discuss the mis
sions of the Commission on Under
graduate Education. I encourage all of 
you to take advantage of this excellent 
opportunity.
As always, should you have any con
cerns or questions, please do not hesi

It is widely believed that tuition pays 
professors and administrators sala
ries, but I have found that this is not 
true. Over the summer, President 
Mehrabian held a meeting in the Ball
room for faculty and staff concerning 
the budget in the wake of the NSF 
cutbacks. Tuition, he reported, does 
not account for a significant source of 
income. Tuition mostly goes back to 
students in the form of financial aid, 
with the difference probably account
ing for overhead.
At nearly all private universities, tu
ition is artificially inflated. This is done 
in order to make a university appear 
competitive. It is believed that good 
schools are expensive, and that expen
sive schools are good. Tuition prices are 
based on those set at other schools, 
placing the cost of an education way 
above the means of ordinary people. To 
offset this, schools provide financial aid 
to cover costs, financial aid funded by 
tuition revenue. What we have is a 
cycle of funds where over-priced tuition 
goes to help people pay that same tu
ition. Inflation and overhead cause the 
cost to rise each year.
The other thing that concerned me in 
Robinsons column was the myth about 
life outside of college. He wrote about 
the A1 Bundy life guaranteed for those 
who do not graduate with a degree. 
Without undermining the importance 
of a college diploma in todays world, it 
is important to realize that college is 
not the limit of ones life. The idea that 
a degree is the only thing between you 
and a miserable life of struggle is unre
alistic and unhealthy. Students at CMU 
are obsessed with their futures, dedi
cating all their lives to tomorrow with
out thinking about where they are right 
now. CMU offers wonderful opportuni
ties to grow and expand, but many 
students dismiss them for the sake of 
security. As a result, there are miser
able people here who live from day to 
day feeling that life is made of paying 
dues. They may be shocked to find out 
that the Utopia that they work so hard 
for here is not the good life they might 
be counting on.
College is more than paying tuition 
so you can get by in later life. College 
is learning how to deal with people, 
both on a working and a social level. 
College is where high-school insecuri
ties should be weeded out so that the 
real world is not so threatening. If 
more members of the CMU community 
spent less of this precious time polish
ing their resumes and more time get
ting to know other people, they would 
be happier now, and would be better 
prepared in the future.

Bundys provide realistic 
view of family life
Editor:
A Franklin Wheelers 
column last week ex
plaining the right and 
wrong reasons for dislikingMarried... with 
Children was superb [Give the Bundys 
a chance, 9/23]. Yes, the Bundys are 
stupid and horrible people, but they are 
so obviously stupid and horrible that it 
becomes impossible to take them seri
ously and their fans have to laugh at 
them.
The Bundys probably make people 
feel a little less guilty about not having 
a perfect family life. They are a refresh
ing dose of intentional bad taste 
amongst a slew of sickeningly sweet 
sitcoms, where the outlook is always 
bright and the characters are always 
optimistic. So what if their humor isnt 
appreciated universally? For those who 
enjoy shock value, Married... with Chil
dren can be a delightful half hour of 
toilet humor, sexual dysfunction jokes, 
and tawdry innuendo. The Bundys are 
best when theyre at their worst.
Theres no reason for any Bundy fan, 
man or woman, to be ashamed of his or 
her taste in purposely trashy TV. Watch 
the show in syndication religiously, hum 
the theme song until you feel suffi
ciently dizzy, and the next time youre

Junk food threatens underage students
The University administration should expend more of its 
time and energy on eradicating the serious and wide
spread problem of junk food consumption by students 
who have not reached their 21st birthdays.______________
Jeffery Basista
Last week, a letter to the edi
tor concerning alcohol policy 
[CMU must take strong stance 
on alcohol policy, 9/23] com
plained that the University does 
not regulate underage drinking 
strictly enough. The writer 
claimed that underage drink
ing is the most important issue 
facing Carnegie Mellon today. 
Having been reminded of the 
keen reasoning and sound argu
ments that defend our liquor 
laws, I would like to recommend 
a similar policy on a different 
issue. While I agree that we must 
eliminate underage drinking to 
safeguard the well being of all at 
Carnegie Mellon, I think it would 
be misguided to make this regu
lation our first priority.
Instead, the University admin
istration should expend more of 
its time and energy on eradicat
ing the serious and widespread 
problem of junk food consumpLETTERS, from page 6
education, yet teaching seems 
to play a minor role in the 
universitys mission. Many fac
ulty teach one or two classes a 
year, and spend the rest of their 
time conducting research.
The student or parent then 
asks, What does research have 
to do with teaching? Why am I 
paying for this professor to do 
research?
Although research may have 
little direct import for under
graduate teaching, it has much 
to do with the education of gradu
ate students.
A doctoral student comes to a
tion by students who have not 
reached their 21st birthdays. 
Such consumption may not be 
illegal, but its ruinous effects 
are manifest on campus.
The health risks of underage 
junk food consumption are well 
known. Two such risks are 
weight gain and its consequences 
on mental health. Doctors and 
actuaries alike inform us that 
weight gain leads to many physi
cal problems. But a young col
lege student, harried by the 
course load and confined to a 
desk by studies, does not think 
about these problems, many of 
which develop very slowly and 
gradually. Rather, he or she 
seeks solace in a delectable bag 
of potato chips, or perhaps in a 
candy bar. Soon, the student 
gains weight. Because our ad
vertising industry persuasively 
demonstrates how weight gain 
jeopardizes social life and, pos
sibly, financial welfare, the 
students self-esteem is crushed.
If only students could be preventedfrom eatingthis junkfood 
in the first place! When the 
uninitiated man or woman be
comes 21 years of age, he or she
research university like CMU in 
order to learn how to contribute 
to the advancement of human 
knowledge; the only way to do 
this is by working on a professors 
research project. Thus research 
faculty are intimately involved 
in the education of their gradu
ate students.
Yet research does have sec
ondary benefits for the under
graduate. Much of what is taught 
in the classroom was originally 
research results.
The reputation of a university 
derives primarily from the qual
ity of its research. This prestige 
enhances the ability of undergams the maturity to overcome 
the temptations of vending ma
chine excess and junk food, re
gardless of stress or physical con
finement. The potato chip may 
still prove formidableno one 
can eat just one, as the ad used 
to saybut the 21 -year-old will 
know how to stop at two, or per
haps three.
Moreover, the maturity and 
insight that arrive on a 21st 
birthday ensure that adults can 
control their intake of junk food 
and its toxic additives; in doing 
so, they prevent themselves from 
becomingsocialnuisances. I once 
feared for my safety when a 
large, under-21 student, enliv
ened by excessive consumption 
of caffeine-laced beverages and 
enraged by problems with his 
term paper, began pounding on 
his workstation and the walls 
around it. I cowered, terrified by
graduates to obtain good jobs 
when they graduate. Under
graduate students can also get 
involved in research through 
programs like the Undergradu
ate Directory of ReseaYch Op
portunities, and are enriched by 
the experience.
Moreover, research grants pay 
for a far greater portion of the 
universitys costs than does tu
ition income. The cost of teach
ing includes the salaries and 
benefits (e.g., health care and 
pensions) of the faculty and their 
secretaries, the cost of office and 
classroom space, and the cost of 
overhead such as administrahis savage behavior.
Afterward, I became frus
trated, because I knew that pro
hibition of underage junk food 
consumption could have pre
vented the incident. If caffeine 
werent so readily available in 
various liquid beverages, stu
dents wouldnt set aside assign
ments until the night before due 
day. Knowing that caffeine will 
not be there to assist them in 
keeping a poorly-planned sched
ule, they would be sure to work 
on their assignments well in 
advance. They could no longer 
lean on the caffeine crutch, un
less they chose to buy caffeine 
pills. (These, too, should be regu
lated, but that issue is beyond 
the scope of this column.)
Additional minor dangers re
sult from underage junk food 
consumption. I have often 
stained my clothing on lounge
tion, the registrar, and the li
braries. Of the portion of this 
expense attributable to under
graduate teaching, tuition pays 
for less than half, with the bal
ance, coming from alumni gifts. 
Because these costs increase 
faster than the consumer price 
index, tuition grows faster than 
inflation. Yet the amortization 
of administration costs between 
teaching and research means 
that the university is able to 
afford better resources than it 
could otherwise.

furniture that had been visited 
by an underage junk food con
sumer. (I know that this con
sumer was underage, because 
no 21-year-old would leave a 
sticky soda can on a table or 
desk, or leave greasy bits of po
tato chips on a sofa cushion.) I 
have slipped and fallen on slick 
plastic junk food litter carelessly 
left behind by underage consum
ers. (Again, those who are at 
least 21 do not do such things.) 
These irritations could be elimi
nated if we only had the courage 
to enact appropriate legislation.
We cannot expect students un
der 21 to voluntarily control their 
urges for fat, sugar, and caffeine 
contained in tasty vending ma
chine fare. Although a few under21 students may be able to use 
these substances in junk foodform 
without causing harm to society,

Capture Hussein: Noriega needs a cellmate
John Weber
Saddam Hussein, president of Iraq, is 
at it again. The problem is that in the last 
week, Hussein has twice detained the 
UN inspectors examining Iraqs nuclear 
facilities.
Who cares. Leave Hussein alone, right? 
Hope that United Nations sanctions and 
empty threats will scare him or force him 
into turning his nuclear secrets over to 
the United Nations, right? Wrong. This 
approach didnt work in January of 1991, 
and it wont work now. Since the war 
ended, Hussein had been lying low, but 
now that the world has gone back to doing 
whatever it was doing before the war, he 
has regrouped his army and is ready to 
resist the United Nations again. His lat
est game is hiding nuclear materials and 
papers concemingnuclear capability from 
UN inspectors and preventing them from 
taking anything they do happen to find.
What should be done with Hussein?
The first option is that the United States 
could blow Iraq right off the map. But 
that would be unfair to the Iraqi people 
and Iraqs innocent neighbors, even 
though it would not change the desert 
landscape much. Furthermore, it would 
not be a realistic solution to a difficult 
problem.
Desert Storm II is another option. This 
time the object would be Hussein himself. 
President Bush has hinted at using force 
again, but most likely not like Desert Storm 
I. The sequal is never as good as the origi
nal. This wouldbe too expensive and would 
punish the Iraqi people for something they 
didnt do. To recommence bombing and 
invade Iraq again is unnecessary and ex
cessive. Another war will just cost Iraq 
more lives and America more money.
What.shouldbe done? How about Opera
tion Just Cause II instead of Desert Storm 
II? In1990, when the United States wanted 
just one man, Manuel Noriega, we launched 
Operation JustCause. Now America wants 
Saddam Hussein. George Bush can line 
the army up just like in Desert Storm, but 
instead of another war, just send a unit 
into the Iraqi capital and attempt to cap
ture Hussein. If they can capture him with 
a small force, as in Operation Just Cause, 
the attack will be a success.
Once Hussein is captured, all the 
nuclear materials and plans can be de
story would be more interesting and 
longer to tell, though.
Once in prison, the Iraqi peoples 
memories of Hussein would fade, or they 
would look on him as a disgrace, because
After Hussein is in custody, he can bunk with 
Noriega and they can tell each other their life 
stories. Hussein's story would be more inter
esting and longer to tell, though.
stroyed and all United States forces can 
come home. With any luck, the problem 
with Iraq will be solved.
Itis important to note here that Hussein 
cannot be killed by the United States or 
by any other outside country. To do this 
would make him an Iraqi hero and would 
be disasterous. The Iraqi people would 
idolize Hussein as the man who stood up 
against America, the Great Satan.
Instead, Hussein should be put in prison 
for life. After Hussein is in custody, he 
can bunk with Noriega and they can tell 
each other their life stories. Husseins
it is honorable to die in battle in Iraq,but 
a disgrace to be imprisoned. A Hussein 
serving life in prison is much safer than 
a dead Hussein and an angry Iraq.
Hussein will never live peacefully as 
long as he is leader of Iraq. He will 
always be looking for ways to build his 
army and become a major Middle East 
power again. Hopefully, he will someday 
decide to end his life, in the manner of 
his idol, Adolf Hitler, and do the whole 
civilized world a favor.

for several hours. His demands? A pizza. 
And a Coke. The youth was subdued after 
he put down his weapon to light a cigartte.
To some, this is a wonderful dream. 
Becoming a hero teen who rights societys 
wrongs with an Uzi and a little gusto. Who 
hasnt fantasized about going to school, 
lighting' a smoke right in the middle of 
class, offing a couple of random fools, and 
having food delivered at the same time?
But what made this punk think he 
could get away with it? Surely Mom and 
Dad didnt pack Juniors lunch with as
sault rifle rounds. I doubt that hed just
seen one too many Christian Slater mov
ies and therefore thought that this kind 
of behavior was okay. No, something else 
is very wrong here.
You and I have grown up watching tele
vision. For some of us, it was a little bit. For 
others, it was thousands of hours each 
year. Our generation, while still stricken 
by idiocy and sloth, has been able to discern 
reality with reasonable agility. My fear is 
that those who are younger than ourselves 
are unable to make this distinction. It is 
almost like some huge plot coming to frui
tion  a deadening of any intelligent 
thought in an entire generation. Instead of 
being able to define right and wrong for 
ourselves, morals come readily packaged 
in color  and in stereo, where available. 
We are left to be programmed by Holly
wood in its infinite wisdom. It says things 
like America is perfect, capitalism is godli
ness, and women should all be thin, beau
tiful and sexy. Everyone laughs at the

stupidity of televison, but we buy into 
everything it spews out.
At the same time, the formulization and 
violence of television charge forward 
unchecked. People begin to shy away from 
anything too different. It is gratifying to 
have the same scenerio replayed for us. We 
become married to the blandness of it all. 
To hold our shrinking minds captive just a 
moment longer, the killings become more 
frequent and bloodier. Television tells the 
confused boy that if his problems cant be 
resolved like the Bradys could, its okay to 
terminate the teacher. If his life doesnt fit 
the mold television sets forth, he is awk
ward, an outsider. He throws his life in the 
toilet because he doesnt know how to deal 
with his problems.
The answer to these problems is amaz
ingly clear: retard the influence of televi
sion. Recycle your television and read for 
pleasure instead. If you someday have 
children, buy them books. Keep them 
from rotting. Its that easy. By doing 
these two simple things, you foster indi
vidual thought, strengthen your mind, 
and end the tyranny of television.
Germain E. DeSeve is a sophmore 
drama major.

A PERSON'S
Dr. Seuss, childrens au
thor andNobel laureate, died 
this past week. His many fans 
remember the man who cre
ated Horton, The Cat in the 
Hat, and the Grinch, which 
remain some of the most 
memorable childrens story 
characters. With the death 
of Dr. Seuss this week, 
what memories do you 
have of the man and his 
books?
Beth Zimmerman 
Junior
Mechanical Engineering
Dr. Seuss made reading fun 
for me. Adults and children of 
all ages could enjoy his litera
ture; his wide appeal was his 
greatest gift. His books remain 
timely, even today.
Britt Nichols
Sophomore
Drama
I idolized Dr. Seuss. If I could 
have traded places with him, I 
would do it. Dr. Seuss was a 
master of childrens literature.
Kit Kasibang
Freshman
H&SS
When I was young and just 
learning to read, I was so proud 
of myself when I could read one 
of his books without stumbling 
over any of the words.
Emily Burke
Senior
Biology
All of my fondest childhood 
memories revolved around Dr. 
Seuss. Christmas just wasnt 
Christmas without watching the 
The Grinch Who Stole Christ

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  30 September 199111
Junk food consumption requires 
responsibility, moral rectitude
JUNK FOOD, from page 7
most are not. To protect them, 
and to protect ourselves, I pro
pose that all junk food be con
fined to special, licensed eat
ing establishments and statelicensed stores. Studentswould 
be required to present a valid 
ID card, proving that they are 
of age. This approach is simi
lar to our treatment of liquor.
I realize that some may ob
ject to my stem policy. But, 
I'm only 18, and Im not fat. I 
only eat junk food at parties, 
only enough to loosen up and 
have some fan. I recycle what
ever packaging I can, and I 
throw away the rest. One of 
the few pleasures I have at
Carnegie Mellon is a bag of 
Doritos and a few cans of RC 
Cola on the weekend. Must you 
take that away from me?
The answer I must give to 
such a person, unfortunately, 
is yes: Although your will
power is admirable and your 
sense of responsibility is com
mendable, you must remem
ber that there are those your 
age who are not as strong as 
you are, those who are not as 
mature. Laws cannot distinguishbetween you and the rest. 
When they reach the age of 21, 
they will possess your recti
tude, and they will consume 
junk food responsibly and mor
ally. You must wait for them.
While it is true that you will be 
deprived of pleasures that 
should be yours to enjoy, you 
must consider the greater good 
and the limitations of law.
It is for this greater good that 
we must constantly strive. Spe
cifically today, we must prevent 
our young people from harming 
themselves and others.
It is evident that while not 
illegal, consumption of junk 
food by those under 21 is a 
serious threat to society. Our 
university shouldbeon the van
guard in outlawing such con
sumption.

SPORTS
PRESS PASS
by Jason McDonald
Showing 
up is half 
the battle
The champagne was flowing 
on Thursday night (at least in 
a metaphorical sense) as the 
Pioneers B intermediate co-rec 
volleyball team finished an 
undefeated 4^0 regular sea
son. The only drawback to the 
Division C pennant-clinching 
celebration was that we still 
hadnt played a regular season 
game.
Thats right. Four wins, all 
by forfeit. Talk about a win
ning streak.
The numbers are startling. 
Sixteen of the 48 (yep, thats 
one-third) co-rec volleyball 
teams that started the season 
fell by the wayside under the 
new forfeit mle. Our division 
is even more twisted; every 
loss by every team came as a 
result of forfeit. KSA A will 
also be going to the playoffs 
from our division, but they 
havent played either. Their 
only loss came when they 
didnt show up for the game 
against us.
Mike Mastroianni told me 
that going to our playoffs 
would be our reward for 
following the rules and show
ing up. The reward isnt going 
to seem so great when we have 
to go into an intermediate 
playoff game totally cold.
Well be going up against the 
Sudsuckers, a team which will 
have a whopping one game (or 
maybe two games) under its 
belt. The well-drilled squad 
that survives that match will 
move on to compete against 
Cheese Blintz  one of our 
scouts says theyre good 
enough to take the whole 
tournament, and they've even 
played a few games. Whether 
its us or the Sudsuckers, 
neither of us stands much of a 
chance. Either team is going to 
end up looking like the Tin 
Man before Dorothy broke out 
the 3-in-l Oil.
For some reason, the outlook 
on the touch football frontier 
isnt quite as bleak; as of 
Thursday night, only four 
teams had missed the two 
games necessary to be dropped 
from the schedule. The big 
problem is in the three menthree women requirement, 
which football obviously 
doesnt have. Ive seen a few 
teams show with six or seven 
guys, but no women; therefore, 
a forfeit is called even though 
there are physically enough 
players there to play the game.
But why is it that forfeits 
are showing an overall rise? 
Obviously, the administration J 
within specific teams needs 
some fine-tuning, but this is a 
problem for any team, regard
less of sport. After all, despite 
pur 4-0 season, the fourth 
game was the first one I knew 
about. I guess this just means 
that there are teams that are 
even more clueless than we 
were.
I dont think this should be 
taken as a damnation of the 
new forfeit system, though. I 
find it hard to believe that 10 
or 12 college people were so 
afraid of losing $5, that they 
worked their whole schedules 
for weeks on end around two 
or three volleyball games.
Most of us aren't that short of 
cash.

Tartans tie #17 
Yellowjackets
Sam Greenfield/Tartan Photographer
Junior stopper John Stivoric heads the ball away from Brandeis forward Joel Thompson. The 
Tartans won the Brandeis game, 1-0, and played to a 0-0 tie against Rochester on Sunday.
By JASON McDONALD
Tartan Sports Editor
The mens soccer season has had some 
high points (conference wins over Wash
ington and Brandeis) and some low 
points (losses to Pitt and Case West
ern). Yesterday, the team got an in
creasingly common medium point as it 
battled to a 0-0 tie with the University 
of Rochester. The tie put the Tartans at 
2-2-3 on the season, including a 1-1-1 
mark in University Athletic Associa
tion play.
Obviously, wed have liked to win, 
but were satisfied, said junior for
ward Terence Sibiya. We had our 
chances; they had their chances, so a tie 
is a pretty fair result.
The best of those chances came in the 
overtime periods. With six minutes left 
in the first overtime, Sibiya turned the 
comer of the Rochester defense, but 
fired just to the left of the top comer of 
the net. Senior Young Kang had a 
breakaway in the late stages of the 
second overtime, but he was unable to 
capitalize, also missing to the left.
Senior sweeper Alan Horn, who will 
be out at least five weeks with a stress 
fracture, commented on the 
Yellowjackets, who came into 
yesterdays game ranked seventeenth 
in the nation among Division III teams. 
They had some speed ... but they 
werent a top 20 team, he said. They 
just hit the ball long and tried to run by 
us. Their goalie was pretty good, but we 
didnt get to test him much.
Sibiya added, They had strong de
fenders... and had me marked pretty 
well. Usually I can just blow by them. | 
Everything else was not that impres- j 
sive.
On Friday night against Brandeis 
University, Sibiya did just blow right j 
by the Brandeis defense, with 22 min- | 
utes left in the game, to score the lone \ 
goal of the Tartans 1-0 win. Sibiya was \ 
fueled by a first-half cheap shot from , 
Brandeis forward Andrew Roberts, who I; 
received a red card with 8:46 left in the ' 
first half for elbowing Sibiya in the jaw. .
I really wanted to pay them back for 
the cheap shot, said Sibiya. When I 
scored my goal in the second half, I 
really enjoyed that.
Sibiya actually had a chance to widen 
the Tartan lead late in the game, but 
his breakaway with ten-and-a-half min
utes left was stopped by Brandeis goal-j 
keeper Rob Bilsbury.
Returning to the injury to Alan Horn: 
the preliminary guess is that he will 
miss five or six weeks, but Horn intends; 
to see another doctor and get another; 
X-ray this week. Freshman Jeff; 
McJunken has moved into the sweeper; 
position in Horns absence, and junior; 
Mark Lotter has filled McJunkens; 
backfield position.

Freshman quarterback Chris Dee unloads a pass as the Duquesne 
pass rush descends on him. The Tartans won Saturdays game, 28- 
14.
By JUDY GROSSMAN
Tartan Senior Staffwriter
There were fireworks Satur
day night at South High Sta
dium, both on the field and off.
While a dazzling fireworks 
display lit the citys skies, fresh
man quarterback Chris Dee ig
nited the Tartan offense, throw
ing for 112 yards and two touch
downs to spark a 28-14 win over
crosstown rival Duquesne.
I just came in and did what I 
had to do, said Dee.
What he did was connect with 
sophomore receiver Andy Van 
Sprang on a perfectly executed 
43-yard touchdown that knot
ted the game, 77, with 48 sec
onds left in the first half. The 86- 
yard touchdown drive began af
ter senior defensive back Andy 
Helms intercepted a Todd
Cunningham pass at the Tartan 
three yard line and ran it back 
eight yards to the 11.
He [Dee] said that we needed 
something big and we got it, 
said Van Sprang.
The Tartans found themselves 
trailing early, after Cunningham 
threw a 12-yard touchdown pass 
to flanker Jason Briscoe. The 
touchdown capped off a nineplay, 75-yard drive and featured 
an unlikely hero.
Halfback Joe Clark, who came 
into the game after starting half
back Mike Haines was injured, 
sprinted for 31 yards on his first 
carry, dragging two Tartan tacklers with him before finally be
ing brought down at the CMU 
41.
We knew they had quick 
backs, said linebacker Mike 
Hession, but we thought the 
sweep would be hard. They sur
prised us with how well they ran 
to the outside.
Despite Duquesnes first-half 
success (115 rushing yards), the 
Tartan defense made its pres
ence known. In the fading sec
onds of the half, sophomore line
backer Jeff Blue busted through 
and sacked Cunningham, knock
ing him temporarily out of the 
game.
Cunningham returned in the 
third quarter, but found little 
success. Dee was considerably 
more successful, engineering an 
eight-play, 7 3-yard scoring drive 
that culminated in a 19-yard 
touchdown pass to junior tight 
end Scott Peters.
The offense overcame a lot of 
adversity, said Dee. We came 
back and did everything right in 
the second half.
The Tartans kept the ball on 
the ground, with senior halfback 
Greg Marmol taking an inside 
reverse for 11 yards, and Dee 
scrambling for 14 yards on an 
option. The key play of the drive, 
however, came on third and two, 
when a personal foul against the 
Dukes gave the Tartans first 
down at the Duquesne 31.
Three plays later, Dee hit Pe
ters for the go-ahead score. Fred 
Hardings extra point gave the 
Tartans a 147 lead with 14:24 
left in the game. But the Dukes, 
taking advantage of a Tartan 
fumble, bounced back. This time 
Haines took the ball on a sweep 
and ran it in from the four to 
once again tie the score, 1414.
The Dukes would not see the 
end zone the rest of the game, ai 
the Tartan defense took overi 
holding the Dukes to a mere 10 
yards in two possessions. Meanr 
while, Dee & Co. went on a scorn
ing binge, doubling their point 
total in the final seven minutes 
of the game.
After Dee scored the game!- 
winner on a quarterback sneaky, 
finishing off an eight-play, 76- 
yard drive, Hession made sur 
the Dukes would not come back. 
On fourth and eight, after tw{) 
straight incompletions, Cun
ningham found himself scram
bling to elude a three-man Tar
tan msh.
He threw a sideline pass, 
which would have been good for 
a first down if the receiver had 
been a Duquesne player. But 
the ball fell into Hessions hands 
and he ran it back 15 yards to 
the Dukes 29.
Thats why he was a pre-sea}- 
son all-American, said defen
sive coordinator Terry Bodnar;
I was just in the right place 
and stepped in front of it, said 
Hession. Then I looked kind of 
goofy running down the field,

Womens soccer breaks .500 mark with home wins
By PAUL PLATOSH
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
What occured at Gesling Sta
dium Saturday night was not 
for the faint-hearted. Two teams, 
CMU and California University 
of PA, met to settle a score that 
was left open at the close of last 
season. Needless to say, the com
petition was intense, but the 
Tartans prevailed, 1-0, to raise 
their season record to 43.
We played tough, but we also 
played well, said sophomore 
forwardRachelBourn. They are 
a big rival, and they wanted to 
win pretty bad.
It was a sloppy game, said 
head coach Julie Shackford. 
They hadno technical skill, and 
we played down to their level. 
Both teams played extremely 
physical games. California, how
ever, preferred to play a runand-gun game, not really man
aging the ball, but fielding it to 
forwards downfield. The Tartans 
played a more managed game, 
passing and carrying the ball 
down the field.
We wanted to have a passing 
game, said Bourn. Their style 
of play made it tough to do, but 
I think it worked out better.
It looks like the Tartans had 
the key, because near the end of 
the first period, in a hectic battle 
in the California zone, sopho
more forward Julie Paul put a 
Bourn header over the 
goaltenders head. This gave the 
Tartans the lead, as well as con
fidence and momentum as the 
whistle blew to mark the half.
A one-goal lead, however, does 
not mean that you can sit back 
on your heels, as junior fullback
Sonya Chmielnicki was quick to 
point out. We really wanted to 
score a few more goals to secure 
our lead. California came back 
in the second half with a con
certed effort, which was foiled 
time and time again by the 
Tartans solid defensive wall and 
powerful goaltending.
We played tough, said 
Chmielnicki. Everyone marked 
[their opponents] well.
It was nothing fancy, said 
Shackford. Wejusttookthe win 
and ran."
On Tuesday, the Tartans 
evened their season record at 3 
3 with a 4-0 win over Washing
ton and Jefferson. The Tartans 
have a busy week ahead: they 
travel to Seton Hill College this 
evening, followed by a rematch 
at W&J on Saturday and a Sun
day home game against IUP.

Controversy clouds mens meet; women fare well at Dickinson
By MARK ALBERTS
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Its gotta be the1 shoes.
Or maybe its just pure speed and 
dedication.
Whatever the case is, Carnegie 
Mellons mens and womens cross coun
try teams ran their way to another 
impressive showing Saturday. This 
time, the womens team traveled to 
Carlisle, Pennsylvania for the 
Dickinson College Invitational and the 
riien stayed in Pittsburgh for a compe
tition at Schenley Park hosted by 
Duquesne University.
The womens team ran in a crowded 
field consisting of 97 competitors and 
10 teams. One of the members of the 
womens team couldnt compete due to
an illness and another couldnt com
pete for academic reasons, so Carnegie 
Mellons squad didnt have enough run
ners to compete as a team. The four 
runners who did compete for CMU in 
the 5000 meter (3.1 mile) race ran im
pressively and placed very well in the 
overall individual standings.
Senior Carolyn Lowe blew by the 
competition to finish first overall with 
a time of 18:24. Lowes time was the 
fastest time that the course had been 
run in six years. Junior Wendy Evans 
(21:02, 45th overall), sophomore Aliza 
Hildebrand (21:31, 52nd overall), and 
freshman Karen Bryla (24:05,81 st over
all) also fared well in the competition.
According to womens coach Dario 
Donatelli, Carnegie Mellons runners 
went out much quicker this week. He
was very pleased with the way they 
ran and added that they all ran their 
best of the season.
The competition for the mens cross 
country team was marred by question
able results. The team defeated George 
Washington University, St. Francis, 
and St. Bonaventure, but lost to 
Duquesne University, which hosted the 
meet. A controversy arose when four of 
the top five CMU runners finishing 
places werent properly recorded, and 
when doubts about whether or not 
Duquesne University competed fairly 
came about.
While its still not certain whether 
cheating was involved, it is believed 
that two of the nine Duquesne runners 
may have run a shorter course than the 
other runners, giving Duquesne a bet
ter finishing time. Head mens coach 
Gary Meckley, who was noticeably up
set about the controversy, said, If they 
[Duquesne] beat us fair and square 
then I commend them for it, but I find 
it hard to believe that their guys im
proved that much in one week. In my 
own mind, Id like to know what hap
pened.
In light of the doubtful results, 
Meckley added, I prefer to say its 
pretty much of a non-contest. The ques
tions surrounding this race are being 
investigated, which is little consolation 
to the team members who were very 
befuddled according to Meckley.
Despite the controversy, CMU had 
another strong performance. Sopho
more Jim Langer finished the race with 
a time of 26:12, followed immediately
by senior John Frieder (26:30), junior 
Brad Shapiro (26:37), freshman John 
Burns (26:44), and junior Scott Phillips 
(26:58). Coach Meckley, putting the best 
face on the situation, commended his 
team for coming along quite nicely. 
He added that the times the men posted 
were the best times theyve run this 
year. Given the impressive running, 
Meckley looked, beyond the disappoint
ment of a questionable race and said 
the team was gearing up for whats 
going on in November.
The mens and womens teams have a 
week off, leading up to the Pittsburgh 
All-City meet on October 12. The AllCity meet will be another chance for 
CMUs teams to show their continuing 
improvement and will be another good 
test, according to Meckley.

The CMU womens volleyball team placed third 
in the University Athletic Association Round Robin 
tournament held at Washington University, St. 
Louis, this weekend. This tournament determined 
seeding for the UAA Championships, which will 
be held October 2527 at New York University. 
Based on the high level of competition in the 
UAAs, the winner of that tournament will get an 
automatic bid to the Division III national champi
onships.
The Tartans performance in this tournament 
gives them their highest seeding since the forma
tion of the UAA in 1986.
The Tartans played 30 games this weekend. 
They defeated each team in at least one game, 
except Washington University, last years na
tional Division III runner-up and the eventual top 
seed of the tournament. Match wins came against 
Case Western Reserve University (16-14, 15-8, 
1416,15-10), Brandeis University (1315,15-1, 
1115,16-14,158), Emory University (15-8, 7 
15, 157, 4-15, 1511), and the University of
Rochester (14-15,12-15,15-5,15-6,15-13).
The fact that the Tartans beat each team in at 
least one game has given them a sense of confi
dence that they can do well in the UAA Champi
onships next month. We have seen all of the 
teams and we know what to expect. We have a 
month to work on improving our game to the point 
where we can beat the teams we lost matches to 
[Washington University, University of Chicago, 
and New York University], said sophomore Jen
nifer New. The deciding games against NYU and 
Chicago were lost by only two point margins.
According to junior Elizabeth Rowlands, This 
tournament had the best competition we have 
seen all year. We really showed how much we 
have improved since the beginning of the season 
by pulling it together and placing third.
The squad members realize that there is still 
room for improvement. They hope to be able to win 
matches in three games, rather than extending 
them to exhausting four or five game, two-and-ahalf-hour marathons. But overall, they are pleased 
with their performance this weekend. CMU hopes 
to continue its winning ways this week with a 
Wednesday match against Grove City.

battle, much to my surprise, I 
had the right winner, but the 
circumstances were very dif
ferent from what I expected. 
If the Jets could win the close 
games, theyd be actual con
tenders. And this weeks 
matchup should be much the 
same, only a better game.
The Washington Redskins 
are coming in undefeated af
ter letting Cincinnati come 
back to tie before winning the 
game, 34-27. The Eagles also 
had some problems last week 
with Pittsburgh, before they 
kicked into gear and pelted 
the Steelers 23-14. I think

did after watching last Sundays 
game: play calls. A smart of
fense doesnt throw on second 
and five with only four minutes 
left with the score tied in field 
goal range. It just isnt done. 
And Ill be watching for more 
mistakes tonight as they tangle 
with the Eagles. My guess: Skins 
27, Eagles 24 in overtime.
This Sunday should prove to
be pretty dull. The only game 
of any interest is the 
Redskins-Bears showdown. 
The Bears are coming off a 
close Monday night game last 
week, followed by yesterday's 
game with the best team in 
the NFL (or so Ive said) in 
Buffalo. The Redskins will 
still be feeling the game with 
the Eagles when the march 
onto Soldier Field. Should the 
Skins win theyll be 6-0. 
Theyve done it before, theyll 
do it again, though by no 
means will it be easy. I wont 
be surprised should theBears 
upset, but I wont go out on a 
limb and call it. Redskins 21, 
Bears 17.
The NFC West has the 
week off, but the rest of the 
NFL will look a little like 
this: Dallas over Green Bay 
in a who-really-cares game, 
the Giants over Phoenix in 
the Meadowlands (but look 
for a close game, and Simms 
to return to save the Giants), 
Raiders over the hapless 
Chargers, Houston over the 
Broncos in the Astrodome, 
Pittsburgh over the Colts (I 
would hope easily), Miami 
over New England, Cleveland 
at home over the Jets, Cincinnatifor what could be their 
first or second win of the year 
over Seattle, the Vikings over 
the Lions in a rather mean
ingless NFC Central game, 
and Tampa to upset the 
Eagles in Florida.

Womens tennis posts 1-2 weekend
By DARYL DAVIS
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
The womens tennis team continued its tight 
schedule from last week, playing back-to-back 
tournaments on Saturday and Sunday. This week 
they came out on top in one of the three tourna
ments they participated in.
On Saturday, the team played in a three-school 
tournament with Penn State-Behrend and Al
legheny College. They started out the day on a 
bad note when they lost to Allegheny, 5-0. All 
matches played in this tournament were two-set 
matches. The women were able to rally against 
Penn State, however, and took that competition 
four games to one.
Freshman Kinga Czerska, sophomore Sharyn 
Rotunno, and junior Laura Ahr all defeated their 
singles opponents in easy two-set matches. The 
doubles team of sophomore Whitney Weber and 
Rotunno outlasted Penn States team of Sjoberg
and Shansala to win, 6-3, 3-6, 6-4.
Yesterday, the team traveled to Erie, Pennsyl 
vania to face Gannon University. The Tartanslost three matches automatically because of de^ 
faults and were unable to recover from this defif 
cit.
Czerska took her singles match by beatingGannons Nikki Windsor (61, 6-3), and th& 
doubles team of Czerska and Ahr defeated theiropponents 7-5, 6-4 to give the Tartans the two 
victories of the tournament. The final score was; 
72, Gannon.
Despite the tournament results there was ex-; 
citingnews for the team this weekend. The doubles; 
team of Weber and Rotunno made All-Tourna
ment team; this was an early birthday present for 
Rotunno, who will celebrate her birthday this 
Tuesday.
Today, the Tartans host Waynesburg Collge in' 
a make5up of a match scheduled for last Monday 
which was postponed due to rain.

A melodious tune is coming from somewhere 
nearby. Is it a television blaring scenes from 
"The Dead Poet's Society?" No. Most likely, it is 
one of James McIntosh's bagpipe students enter
taining a group of listeners.
The Bagpipe Club is made up of interested 
students who enjoy the Scottish bagpipe. The 
club also offers bagpipe instruction through the 
Department of Music, but it is primarily an 
extra-curricular atudent activity.
The Bagpipe Club is one of the smaller campus 
organizations, but McIntosh feels that, although 
there isn't large involvement from the student 
body, the club is "no different" from any other. 
He also believes that campus involvement with 
the club could change, but nevertheless, that 
"it's really no big issue." The fact that the club is 
alive and brings a Scottish presence to the school 
is satisfying enough for him.
Bagpipe lessons are scheduled when the stu
dent enrolls and are coordinated with his or her
schedule. The students that have enrolled so far 
have had no previous experience with the bag
pipe. However, they can and have become 
proficient with the bagpipe with a little time and 
practice. The students that enroll in the class 
usually do so as freshmen, and can enjoy four 
years of instruction which provide a bagpipe 
student with a decent background in the study.
The Bagpipe Club currently has no practicing 
facilities of its own on campus, though it has 
applied for a room in one of the drama offices. 
The club also isn't funded by Student Affairs, 
but McIntosh is in the process of seeking some 
type of funding through the University.
McIntosh said that he is proud to contribute to 
furthering the interests of the students of CMU.

What Is Pugpwfisli?
Pugwash ... Pugwash. You've heard of it... Oh, 
it's that organization that has a giant blow-up of 
Einstein's face on its posters. What is that any
way, and what kind of a word is "Pugwash?"
Pugwash, Nova Scotia was home to the 
Pugwash Conferences on Science and World 
Affairs which were held thanks to the efforts of 
atomic scientist Albert Einstein and philosopher 
and mathematician, Bertrand Russell. These 
conferences took place after World War II and 
the subsequent Oppenheimer case. They 
brought the scientists of the world together to 
present papers and to discuss how their work 
influenced the world outside their laboratories.
The Carnegie Mellon chapter of Student 
Pugwash USA (SPUSA) sponsors various fo
rums for discussion on topics relevant to the 
pressing issues of science and technology in 
today's society. Past discussion topics range 
from questions about the Gulf War, to trends in 
the Soviet Union, to the uses of interactive video 
disk technology in ethical decision making.
"We are talking about the issue part of [topics] 
rather than the details of the science and tech
nology ... That is where the involvement of non
engineers is really, really important because ... 
more and more, the non-engineering point of 
view needs to be addressed by the engineers," 
said Pugwash advisor Indira Nair.
Nair, the guiding force behind bringing 
Pugwash to CMU, was motivated by her feeling 
that, "too many CMU students, especially engi
neers, launched onto their careers and took their 
first jobs without really thinking what working 
is all about.
"It is something that you do for the rest of 
your life; it flavors your life, and I thought 
people weren't thinking enough about it. If 
[students] looked at the pay, and the pay was 
high enough, or if they went to the highest 
bidder, if you will... it bothered me a lot.... We 
just don't give them [the option] to think.
"So, I thought [we needed] something to bring 
discussion to the campus ... to have some kind of 
a forum. I knew about the scientists' version of
Pugwash, and I knew that the student Pugwash 
had started out in Berkeley ... I wrote to 
Pugwash National and asked them to send me 
the information. For a couple of summers I 
would send information to the students I had, 
students I knew would be amenable to this, 
[asking them] to let me know if they were inter
ested in starting a chapter."
There was no response until 1985 when a 
couple of students expressed interest. Since 
then, Pugwash has continued to grow and has 
significantly contributed to the campus commu
nity. They've helped sponsor the Toward 
Tomorrow's World Career Fair and brought 
speakers such as Roger Boisjoly to campus.
"Pugwash is often labeled as a tech group 
because of the type of topics it discusses, al
though the discussions often involve non-tech 
issues, such as ethics and societal implications of 
technology," explained Jim Vierengel, a senior 
in EPP and Civil Engineering and a member of 
the Pugwash steering committee. "This misun
derstanding probably contributes to the diffi
culty we have in bringing more students from 
arts and humanities. An additional problem of 
attracting large numbers of people is that most 
of our events are geared toward smaller discus
sion groups of around 25 to 30 people,"
SUPA student Kathryn Kroehle, also a mem
ber of the Pugwash steering committee, was not 
deterred by the technological focus of Pugwash. 
"I am really interested in environmental policy 
and was looking for a place to discuss these 
issues.... The main thing I have gotten out of 
Pugwash is a chance to meet and talk with a lot 
of different people on campus. The issues dis
cussed ranged in subject matter, but I enjoyed 
hearing a variety of points of view. I especially 
like exploring various ethical questions associ
ated with the topics brought up by the speakby Rhonda Struminger

The male-to-female ratio can cause competi
tion and intimidation in the classroom, espe
cially for women in the sciences. The fear of 
being raped when walking across campus alone 
in the middle of the night is very real. Rape, 
abortion, AIDS, women in combat  these are 
all issues that women must face on a daily basis. 
The Women's Center exists for some of those 
reasons. It is a place on campus where women 
can go so that they can feel comfortable and 
grow as individuals.
The purpose of the Center is to identify and 
address the problems, needs, and goals of 
women on campus and in the community. The 
Center provides information, educational pro
grams, community service, support, and enter
tainment regarding a broad range of issues and 
concerns which profoundly affect women's 
lives. The structure of the Women's Center is 
very unique; it is a collective where everyone is 
equal (students, faculty, and staff), and anyone 
is welcome to join.
The Center means different things to each of 
its members. For senior art major and collective 
member Jessica Buben, it is an essential part of 
life here. "It is nice to have a place on campus 
[that is] run by women [and] that is oriented 
towards women's concerns and issues," said 
Buben. "I couldn't think of any reason not to be 
involved.... The Center is a positive thing.... It is 
some sort of haven."
At business meetings, they plan events and 
schedule meetings and discussion groups. 
Anyone with an idea he or she wants to imple
ment can speak out. Any complaints about the 
Women's Center can also be addressed at the 
meetings. Each person in the collective has an 
equal voice.
"Despite what a lot of people think, it is a 
diverse group of people," said collective mem
ber Seth Kaufman, a graduate student in the 
history department. "People make comments 
such as 'The Women's Center is only for lesbi
ans.' I hardly think I qualify.... The more people 
show up, the more they realize that a narrow 
view is unjustifiable."
According to Mary Bowman, a graduate stu
dent in the art department, the Women's Center 
was started by a group called the Women's 
Issues Collective. "The group was centered 
around women's contemporary issues," said
Bowman. They discussed the need for "a place 
for women because of the men to women ratio. 
The campus needed to have a place where all 
women could go  faculty, staff, graduate 
students and undergraduate students. A letter 
was drafted to then-President Richard Cyert and 
submitted to the administration. Petitions were 
sent out to get the Women's Center started.
There were thousands of signatures."
In the fall of 1989, Student Affairs and the 
Housing Office offered the "Morisson's" recre
ational space for use by the Women's Center. 
With funding from Student Affairs, a computer 
from Student Senate, and a desk and book
shelves from Housing, the Women's Center had 
its grand opening on January 26,1990.
The Center shows movies, has speakers, 
holds coffeehouses, dances, potluck dinners, 
debates, and panel discussions. The Center's 
library includes books, journals and magazines 
that cover topics such as scholarships, careers, 
fiction and health. The Center has a direct rela
tionship with Health Services and the Counsel
ing Center, and other support groups through
out Pittsburgh. Other discussion groups meet at 
the Women's Center, such as Action Against 
Rape, cmuOUT, Working Parents Support 
Group, and many more.
"The Women's Center is a space for all women 
and for all members of the campus community," 
said collective member and junior English major 
Jenn Phillips. "No one in the collective can offer 
a position for the [entire] Women's Center ... but 
general openness about feminism is one of its 
most attractive aspects for me."
Collective members Jen Saffron, a junior in the 
art department, and Justine Dymond, a senior in 
the English department, also talked about the 
collective and its position in campus life 
here. "At first I was very skeptical, not sure how 
much the center was one group's opinion," said 
Saffron. "There are clearly many different things 
to talk about. It is an important part for diversity 
on our campus. This has to be here."
"I would like to see the issues we deal with be 
more integrated into the whole campus commu
nity," said Dymond. "It is a place for women to 
go where they can feel comfortable as individu
als and women."

"Study objectivism/' Carnegie Mellon's Stu
dents of Objectivism President Fred Seiler (ECE 
'91) says. "Philosophy is ultimately very practi
cal, and objectivism will help people be success
ful."
Objectivism was originated by Ayn Rand and 
began to gain public attention about 50 years 
ago. Rand first posited objectivist philosophy in 
her book, Atlas Shrugged. The basic formulation 
of objectivism, however, is presented in Intro
ducing Objectivism, an article Rand wrote. Objec
tivism, and correspondingly CMU's Students of 
Objectivism, is summarized in four basic points. 
Rand termed them "a philosophy for living on 
earth."
Theiirst point is that reality is, in Rand's 
terms, "an objective absolute." Regardless of 
what people want, the world remains the same.
Seiler offered a practical example. "Suppose a 
person has a test in the next week. He has 
known about the test for some time, yet he has 
spent his time worrying instead of studying. No 
matter how much he worries about getting a 
good grade, he hasn't studied the material and 
his grade will suffer. People's emotions cannot 
directly alter reality."
The second point of objectivism is that reason 
is a person's only guide to action. One result of 
this second principle is the establishment of a 
common base for human interaction. If people 
are fully rational  "and if they have enough 
time," Seiler said they will eventually agree on 
the same reality, the same actions. According to 
Seiler, objectivism emphasizes "the choice to 
focus on reality or not." In this view, issues as 
complicated as abortion have solutions if they 
are reasoned thoroughly and all viewpoints 
"focus on reality."
Objectivism's third point is that the pursuit of 
what Rand termed "rational self-interest" is a 
person's most important moral purpose.
"Rational self-interest is a complicated con
cept," says Seiler. "It means applying reason to 
the problem 'How do I achieve my own happi
ness.' "
A fourth made by Rand is that laissez-faire 
capitalism is the best political system.
This fourth point addresses some of the practi
cal concerns of Rand's philosophical position. 
During meetings, members discuss objectivism's
impact on a wide range of topics, including 
economics, psychology, science, and culture. At 
times Rand and objectivism have been associ
ated with the Libertarian party. "Objectivism is 
not libertarianism," Seiler insists. "Some Liber
tarians have claimed to advance objectivist 
philosophy, but Ayn Rand herself strongly 
condemned the Libertarian party."
Other topics of group meetings include the 
idea of God and the theory of capitalism. Mem
bers spend time studying Ayn Rand's thoughts 
in particular, since her ideas still define modem 
objectivism.
Much of the philosophy continues to focus on 
the power of human reason. "Objectivism helps 
people understand how to think logically," says 
Seiler. The keywords of the philosophy reason 
and rationality lead individuals to reality and 
sort out personal contradictions.
"Objectivism has solved many of the philo
sophical issues debated for centuries," Seiler 
says. "It provides a strong defense of the valid
ity of the senses and causality from the argu
ments of Hume and others. It also shows that 
logic is based on reality, and not some random 
manipulation of symbols for academic exercises. 
Logic is not arbitrary." Though not without its 
detractors, objectivism is, according to Seiler, a 
practical philosophy that continues to spread.

Why do cyclists cycle?
"Riding fast slows down time." said local 
mountain bike racer Mark Mcjunuin.
"To reach the summit and cascade down the 
opposite slope, shaking the mind into oblivion." 
said mountain bike racer and senior design 
major David Schaich.
Ask a bishop, why .Catholicism?
"When I got stressed out I used to take mid
night rides to Palm Beach," said H&SS sopho
more and cyclist Mark Roces. "Or, 6 am, I would 
motorpace past local polo fields, through the 
morning fog. Riding through fog is great... you 
can see the dew settle on your crossbar."
The CMU Cycling Club formed earlier this 
year. The club represents a wide variety of 
riders. Skilled and novice cyclists, tourers, 
racers, mountain bikers, and "road spankers" 
meet to share the interests that individually and 
collectively answer the question, "Why cy
cling?"
Mcjunuin recounts one race.
"I was so nervous, I could hardly eat my 
Cheerios," said Mcjunuin. "It was the first road 
race of my season, and I had to prove to the road 
spankers that someone with mountain bike 
heritage could kick on the road.
"Race time ... no more anxiety. It had rained 
just before the race, and all four comers of the 
downtown route were cobblestone. The pack 
approached the first cobblestone corner with 
caution, but 80% of the racers still slid out, 
including me."
"I got up and took my maintenance lap, check
ing for damage," Mcjunuin said. "I caught my 
breath and waited for the pack to circle around. 
My desire to win kept me spinning, and twenty 
miles later I felt great. In two laps I worked up 
to the front of the pack.
tremendous gravity check. I hit the cobblestones 
and slid on my side for about 30 feet. The $450 
first place purse rode out of sight. But I think I 
would have paid that much just to impress the 
crowd which watched me hit those cobblestones 
and slide. Besides, I'm a mountain biker any
way."
Cyclist Schaich offered the following piece of 
advice.
"Go out for a ride  not fifteen minutes to 
shop in Shadyside, but possibly an hour through 
the park. Make your TV screen the landscape; 
your stereo, nature's sounds; your substance, the 
extra air needed to climb that lengthy hill. It's a 
high achieved from exertion, all from you your
self, within."

Investigate Scotland Ytard
If you ask an ordinary person what Scotland 
Yard is, they might say that it's either the head
quarters for the elite British police or some 
board game. When you ask Carnegie Mellon 
students what Scotland Yard is, you will prob
ably get two types of responses.
He or she might say, "What the heck is Scot
land Yard?!" or you may be told that it's an 
exceptional place to eat, relax, and hang out 
among friends, and it is conveniently located 
right in the heart of CMU in Skibo. But for those 
of you who know what and where Scotland 
Yard is, when you walk in and take a seat, you 
probably don't realize that it's student-run.
Scotland Yard is one of the few self-funded 
and independent student organizations at CMU, 
and by this fact alone, it is different from many 
student organizations. Scotland Yard is also a 
business; it makes its own money and is a selfcontained entity. You don't have to be a member 
of this organization or pay any dues, and you 
aren't required to attend meetings there every 
week. Anyone can be found at Scotland Yard, 
faculty as well as students. Finally, it's the clos
est place where students of all ages can eat, hang 
out, be entertained, and enjoy themselves every 
night.
In addition to Scotland Yard being an organi
zation comprised mainly of students, all of its 
entertainment and other activities are arranged 
by the students. For example, in the past, the 
Yard has had the notorious "Sexy Body Parts" 
competition on Valentine's Days, and last year, 
there was a series of poetry readings. Presently, 
every Wednesday night, there is a jazz jam 
session; on Thursday nights, it's "TV Night," 
featuring a big screen TV as entertainment. 
Every other Friday, it's comedy night. At the 
moment, Scotland Yard is trying to get other 
organizations as well as individuals to partici
pate in doing some kind of special event. So 
expect a greater variety of entertainment in the 
near future.
Scotland Yard has a unique history. It was 
founded by a committee of students who had a 
vision, and the project was overseen by then
Dean of Student Affairs Branden Walter. After 
extensive planning, the Yard opened up in 
October, 1985. It started off with a limited menu. 
It was only open on weekends from 7 pm to 2 
am. It was also dependent on Student Affairs for 
funds.
After a couple of years, Scotland Yard evolved 
into an independent business. As this happened, 
the Yard began to develop more into what it is 
today. The committee of students dismantled as 
students graduated. Now, Scotland Yard is 
being run by Lisa Yalen, a recent SUPA gradu
ate. Yalen doesn't have to follow any guidelines; 
she enjoys a lot of freedom as a decision maker 
for Scotland Yard, especially since it is no longer 
funded by other organizations.
Among other changes over the years, the 
menu has been expanded, and the Yard is now 
open seven days a week, 11 am to 2 am on 
weekdays and 6 pm to 2 am on weekends. 
Despite all of these changes, the ultimate pur
pose of Scotland Yard hasn't changed. It's still a 
great place to eat, study, and socialize. The Yard 
is still a place where the whole campus can 
come together and have a good time.

Few topics in the past few years have gener
ated as much interest and concern or created as 
many conflicts as the issue of our environment. 
With the formation of a new campus organiza
tion, Earthwise, students at CMU now have the 
opportunity to contribute directly to the conser
vation of the earth.
Earthwise was founded by Sean Hong, an IM 
senior, and Kristin Pape, a senior in the English 
department. The group is still in the first stages 
of development. "[Sean and I] were on vacation 
at Martha's Vineyard, picking up trash on the 
beach, and [the idea] came to us," said Pape. 
According to Pape, when they brought the idea 
back to campus, "we discovered that there was 
huge interest in a group like this."
It has been recognized by Student Senate and 
approved for funding, which will not be avail
able until the spring. In the interim, the group is 
considering a t-shirt sale and various other fund 
raisers.
Interest in the organization so far has been 
encouraging, with ninety students signing up at 
the Activities Fair, and an average of thirty 
attending each Earthwise meeting. The main 
topics of the meetings and focuses of the organi
zation are "action and generating interest," says 
Pape. Projects currently under tentative consid
eration include increasing campus recycling of 
glass, aiding in the collection of recyclable mate
rial, and planting trees on campus and in nearby 
urban areas. "[Sean and I] wanted to work 
mostly in education and hands-on work, the sort 
of things no one else wants to do."

The Carnegie Tech Radio Club (not to be 
confused with WRCT) is one of the oldest clubs 
on campus. It was formulated at the turn of the 
century as an outlet for "hams," people with an 
interest in amateur radio. Today, the club still 
serves that purpose, among other things. It is 
now gearing itself toward more projects servic
ing the campus and the community.
Deborah Henderson, president of the Radio 
Club, describes the group as "in transition." The 
club has been evolving from a self-contained 
group into a club more integrated with the 
campus life and involved in the community as a 
whole. The Radio Club is also enacting modern
ization efforts to keep up with current technol
ogy. In doing this, the Carnegie Tech Radio Club 
intends to remain true to its original purpose  
to keep the spirit of amateur radio alive.
"Throughout history, amateurs have worked 
hard to develop new communications technol
ogy," said Henderson. "Satellite communication 
was helped along a lot by amateurs."
First and foremost, the club allows its mem
bers to do what they like best: "tinker" amateur 
radio. Atop Hammerschlag Hall is the E. M. 
Williams Memorial Station, where members can 
work with broadcasting equipment. "One of our 
members is experimenting with oscillating a 
laser to transmit information over line-of-sight 
distances. It's not exactly radio, but it is the sort 
of experimentation we're involved in."
One of the club's purposes is to experiment 
with the edge of technology. Members continu
ally search for new capabilities for broadcasting. 
Current experiments involve laser-based broad
casting and satellite reception with the official 
amateur radio satellite, OSCAR 10 (Orbiting 
Satellite Carrying Amateur Radio).
The Radio Club provides coverage and safety 
communications for buggy races and other local 
events, like the Pittsburgh Marathon. The club 
continues to search for new ways to service the 
area. "We're always looking for something new 
that'll work better," Henderson said. "If it'll 
work better, we're going to find it."

If you're like most people in the CMU commu
nity, you're probably thinking, "Water polo? I 
didn't know there was a Water Polo Club at 
CMU." You're almost right  there wasn't a 
Water Polo Club before spring of this year, but 
the club has already been officially recognized 
by Student Senate and has competed against 
other area colleges. Now the club has its sights 
set on becoming a full-fledged varsity team in 
just two years, as soon as University policy will 
allow it.
A few months ago, the only- formal water polo 
played at CMU was in the form of intramural 
competition. This was fine for some people, but 
for people such as sophomore math/C.S. major 
J.P. Lie, who played at his high school in Califor
nia. "Intramurals just didn't cut it," he said.
After the IM water polo championship, the two 
championship teams merged, under Lie's coach
ing, and petitioned Student Senate for formal 
recognition. By the end of the year, the club had 
played two games against Slippery Rock 
University's varsity team. Though the club met 
resounding defeat in both games, the enthusi
asm carried over to this year.
This fall, the club has a new coach and thirty 
members on the roster, and plans to begin prac
tices the weekend after Homecoming. Practices 
will continue throughout the fall, and tourna
ment play will begin in the spring after the CMU 
swim team (which contributes many, but not all, 
club members) finishes its season. While interest 
generated at the club's booth at the Activities 
Fair was "a big plus," according to team mem
ber senior biology major Norman Murray, the 
club still plans active recruitment of new play
ers. "No experience in water polo is necessary, 
and female players are welcome," notes coach 
Jim Cutrone. "The only requirement is [that] you 
have to know how to swim."
Players describe water polo as a cross between 
basketball and soccer, played in a pool. It is an 
experience players described in terms such as 
"exhilarating" and "exhausting." So exhausting, 
in fact, that games last only 28 minutes, divided 
into seven-minute quarters. The seven players 
on each side attempt to advance the ball into the 
opposing goal, but may only touch the ball with 
one hand at a time. The other team attempts to 
stop this by a number of means, and most physi
cal contact is allowed. "It's very violent," says 
sophomore math/C.S. major and club member 
Mark Stemm, "a lot like hockey." The result is a 
highly charged, fast-paced game which is almost 
as exciting to watch as it is to play.

Five undergraduate CMU students 
have decided to stay on for the long 
haul: one more year at school than 
necessary. Some people might think 
theyre a little bit crazy, but these 
students are not insane  theyre 
CMIPs first group of Fifth Year 
Scholars.
Jennifer Arscot, Ingrid Bromberg, 
Paul Charles Hachten, Bob OToole, 
and Kelli Satterwhite are the inaugu
ral Fifth Year Scholars. They are the 
recipients of a scholarship proposed 
by the Student Body President Andy 
Robitshek in 1989. He first brought 
up the idea of offering an additional 
academic year at CMU free for 
exceptional students interested in 
such an opportunity. The idea is 
similar to a program at the Univer
sity of Rochester.
Although Robitshek was not able to 
witness the adoption of the program 
at CMU, Student Body Presidents 
Mark Mittelhauser (1989-90) and 
Kishore Rao (1990-91) were able to 
push the idea through to completion 
last fall. With the help and support of 
President Mehrabian and Dean of 
Student Affairs Michael Murphy, this 
intellectually inspiring idea finally 
became a reality.
Rao commented that the idea 
originally focused heavily on academ
ics. Students with outstanding 
academic careers during their under
graduate educations were the 
programs target. However, Rao says, 
changed that idea a little bit. It 
was very important to have students 
involved from the beginning. Mark 
and I were adamant about having 
extra-curricular excellence, as well as 
academic. I dont think as much 
weight would have been placed on 
that without student involvement. 
Katie Stannard, assistant to the 
dean of Student Affairs, believes that 
the Fifth Year Scholar Program is a 
great asset to the campus and the 
Pittsburgh community. I think that 
these scholars can make some signifi
cant contributions to both Pittsburgh 
and the campus as a community 
because of what they do.
What are these scholars doing? All 
five of this years Scholars are study
ing subjects and engaging in activi
ties both related and unrelated to 
their undergraduate majors. Arscott, 
a painting major in the College of 
Fine Arts as an undergraduate, is 
pursuing her interests in psychology 
and children. She currently has an 
internship with the Childrens School 
at the Carnegie Museum. Arscott 
hopes to combine her interests in art 
and children in teaching. She says, 
Eventually I want to teach. I think I 
really need the background in educa
tion and children to do it, though. I 
already know about the art. I really 
like to work with children and see 
how they grow and what theyre 
capable of.
Satterwhite, a biology/psychology 
double major, is continuing much of 
the work she started as an under
graduate. Last spring I stayed out 
here over spring break, and I had just 
found out about the new program. I 
had been doing some research with 
diabetes for some time, and I wanted 
to continue it. I figured I could stay at 
the University with this program and 
continue my research. Satterwhite is 
also completing a series in calligra
phy and finally taking some longawaited French classes that she 
couldnt fit in her schedule as a 
regular undergraduate.
Bromberg, also a painting major as 
an undergraduate, is taking many of 
her fifth year classes in H&SS. 
Starting the beginning of my junior 
year, I took a class on gender studies 
and that really got me into the 
subject. Then I started doing my art 
work around gender issues, she says. 
Bromberg believes that she can now 
combine two subjects which she 
couldnt before, simply because her 
schedule as a painting major con
flicted with H&SS classes she wanted 
to take.
OToole, a mechanical engineering 
major, is taking a number of pre-med 
classes, as well as history and public 
policy courses in H&SS.
All of the applicants were com
pelled to apply in their senior year 
because the program was not in 
existence during their junior year. 
Normally, the program is offered to 
juniors who wish to apply to stay for 
an additional year after they gradu
ate. Juniors applying have a lot of 
time to plan what they want to do, so 
the program is a good thing for them. 
But we had to do everything so 
quickly; it was sort of strange. A lot of 
people werent even aware we were 
staying, but you get used to it, says 
OToole.
The programs that the Fifth Year 
Scholars choose may be grueling, but 
the application process itself is 
somewhat of an uphill climb. Stu
dents are required to submit an 
initial application which asks about 
activities, interests, and grades. In 
addition to this, the applicants have 
to answer five essay questions.
After the preliminary application is 
submitted, candidates are chosen for 
interviews with a deciding commit
tee. Stannard anticipates that this 
years scholars will be heavily in
volved in next years election process. 
Last year, the selection committee 
included Stannard, Mehrabian, 
Murphy, Rao, Mittelhauser, and the 
associate dean of each applicants 
school.
Despite the long application pro
cess, this years recipients insist that 
the experience of the fifth year is 
wonderful. Arscott says that she 
applied for a fifth year because she 
knew she would miss school, as well 
as her friends, a great deal. She adds 
I wanted to do something different, 
and it was free to do a fifth year. 
Satterwhite agrees that the fifth 
year is interesting and that its been 
great for her so far. One guy has 
been calling me psycho for weeks 
though because he cant believe Im 
staying here for another year! she 
exclaims.
Bromberg notes a similar experi
ence. Ive always been really excited 
about school, so people have always 
thought I was crazy. OToole says 
when people say hes crazy to stay on 
another year, he has to plead guilty.
Many of the recipients of this years 
scholarship say that they will con
tinue with their studies after the year 
is over. OToole says hes not sure 
what he wants to do, but that he has 
a lot of different options after the 
fifth year.
Up to ten people can be accepted 
into the program with a maximum of 
two Scholars per school. For the 
1992-93 academic year, eight candi
dates were selected from all the 
applicants.
One of the candidates who will be a 
fifth year student next year is Nicole 
Brockmann. She is quite enthusiastic 
about the program and plans to take 
design classes as well as continue 
with some additional, work in her 
major, music. Brockmann enthusias
tically believes that the program is a 
great opportunity. Im really glad I 
got accepted because they only gave 
out eight scholarships when they 
really could have given out ten. It 
means that much more to me because 
of the situation, she says.
Although the Fifth Year Scholars 
% program is just getting under way, 
the participants admit that it is 
already a great experience. Many 
students cannot imagine spending 
more time than they have to in an 
already stressful environment, and at 
least one Scholar can sympathize. 
Kelli Satterwhite says, I remember a 
time when I was a sophomore, and I 
wanted to leave this place so badly. 
But after I got my act together and 
really focused myself towards my 
goals, I felt a lot better. I started to 
join outside activities and even get 
more into my schoolwork. I always 
tell other students that I can defi
nitely relate to wanting to leave. But 
the fifth year is great; I would en
courage students to take a look at it.

A little moderation prevents more than bloated goldfish
Everything in moderation, my boy. 
Everything in moderation, These were 
Dads words of guidance the day his 
youngest offspring pried the slow-pour 
cap off a jar of Shrimp Flakes, sending 
an already portly goldfish lunging into 
its most spectacular but tragic of feed
ing frenzies.
But my bout with present-day inter
pretations of moderation stretches far 
beyond any feelings of remorse associ
ated with the image of a pet goldfish 
stuffed to the gill and floating belly-up 
atop the stagnant waters of its liquid

A lot of experts seem to think educa
tion is the cure-all for excessive behav

the bad press sunbathings been receiv

these cosmetically neurotic youngsters 
who get greased up like yesterdays 
ham hocks and bake until bubbling in 
every hour of the summer sun are to
tally unaware that theyll be masquer
ading as dried fruit by their 30th birth
days. Yet in the smallest random sample 
of lets say, Floridians, youll find more 
than one relatively young well-done 
individual who, because of deep-rooted 
problems involving moderation, faces 
the next sixty years as a raisin. Then 
again, who am I to criticize this kind of 
behavior? Its totally possible that one 
excessive person with a particularly 
furrowed and ridged surface finds an
other attractive. Some people really 
have a thing for raisins.
And what about those moderation 
scare tactics, cruelly sprung on unsus
pecting children year in and year out? 
Are they really fair? Who could forget 
the plight of the cocoa-fiend Boy Scout 
in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory ?

out of an entire generation of children.
Whats really difficult to swallow 
about all of this is that in most cases it 
takes some excessive behavior to reach 
a level of true greatness in this world. 
Consider the relentless practice and 
persistence it took before Thomas 
Edison illuminated the light bulb, Joe 
Dimaggio hit in 56 straight games, and
Maxwell J. Beck reached the elite pages 
of the Guinness Book by withstanding 
the largest beard of bees known to man. 
Now, had Maxwell J. Beck been a mod

that 100,000th buzzing bee on his face, 
completing the beard of bees and becoming a household name in the pr^

Study Abroad programs assist students in multi-cultural education
By MARNI BLAKE
Tartan Junior Staff writer
Are you tired of Pittsburgh? 
Do you yearn to broaden your 
horizons? Do you need to dis
cover yourself? If so, it may be 
time to cross your own borders 
and delve into other cultures. 
Each semester many students 
leave their home university to 
travel, work, and study abroad. 
American Youth Hostels and 
programs offered by CMU and 
other universities make this 
option very possible for students.
It was the best experience of 
my life, and I couldnt replace it 
with anything else, said Lauren 
Sroczynski, a junior who spent a 
year studying in Denmark and 
backpacking over Europe. She, 
like many other students who 
have studied abroad, believe that 
once you have learned a new 
language and adjusted to a new
culture, you can adjust to any 
new situation.
Education abroad can in
clude study, work, or even vol
unteer work, which are all great 
ways to go out and learn about 
other people and their cultures. 
Its all education, says Victor 
Thacker, director of CMUs Of
fice of International Education.
If you plan to spend time trav
eling, studying, or working 
abroad, American Youth Hos
tels (AYH) and the International 
Youth Hostel Federation (IYHF) 
can help to make your travel 
more affordable.
By joining AYH or IYHF you 
gain access to more than 5,300 
hostels in 59 countries, includ
ing an array of educational, cul
tural, and environmental pro
grams. These hostels provide a 
true cultural exchange because 
they present an opportunity to 
meet travelers from all nation
alities and backgrounds.
With prices ranging from $7 
to $10 a night, hostels are the 
most economical accommoda
tions for travelers, providing 
dorm-style lodgings with sepa
rate quarters for males and fefacilities allow 40 students to 
study in France and live with 
French families. This program 
is open to all students who can 
demonstrate fluency equivalent 
to one year of college-level 
French.

to anyone. In addition, GSIA and 
the Art and Design Departments

males and self-service kitchens.
If you don't feel secure enough 
roaming throughout the world 
on. your own, there are more 
structured options available 
though Carnegie Mellon or other 
organizations. CMUs newest 
program is the Carnegie Mellon 
Centre de Tours. The center's
CMU also sponsors two ex
change programs, one with the 
Ecole Polytechnique Federal de 
Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzer
land, and one with Keio Univer
sity in Tokyo. The EPFL ex
change is open to second-year 
CIT and MCS students and 
third-year architecture stu
tuition, and you still get your 
usual financial aid package, 
which makes it very feasible to 
study abroad. There are many 
opportunities beyond CMUs 
programs in which students may 
participate as well. Summer 
programs are also available, in
cluding everything from winetasting to really legitimate 
courses, says Thacker.
There are so many options 
out there, Thacker says, so 
whatever you want to do is probably possible.... You can just 
come down here [to the Office of 
International Education] and do 
some research just be sure to 
coordinate with your depart, 
ment to make sure you can re
ceive credit.
There is a general informa
tion meeting on Thursday, Oc
tober 3 at 5 pm in the Adamson 
Wing for anyone interested in 
studying abroad. Keep in mind 
that many application deadlines 
are approaching, especially for 
this springs programs.

Tartan Acting Features Editor
Most people have come in conflict 
with the gender roles that society has 
dictated. Things that make you go 
hmm . and Things that make you go 
jynni... II: For Men were lectures for 
anyone who has felt this conflict.
Christopher Kilmartin, assistant pro
fessor of psychology at Mary Washing
ton College, and Tim Ring, associate 
dean of psychology at Albright College 
professor at Lehigh University, 
held two discussions last Thursday con
cerning gender roles. The lectures, spon
sored by Student Affairs, were at 4:30 
pm and 7 pm in the Skibo Ballroom.
Ring and Kilmartin used an example 
from Ursula K. Le Guins novel, The 
left Hand of Darkness. In this novel,
people have no gender for 24 to 26 days 
out of the month. For the remaining 
four days each person goes through a 
period called kemmer, in which they 
can be either male or female. A person 
becomes a certain sex by encountering 
someone of the opposite sex in kemmer. 
For example, if a person starting 
kemmer encounters a male, that per
son in kemmer will become female. Ring 
and Kilmartin asked the audience what 
might happen in such a world.
The audience in both sessions had 
similar ideas. Some people thought that 
family units would suffer because a 
person could have many different chil
dren, and be mother to some and father 
to others. Others thought relationships 
would be stronger because they would 
not be based on sexual intercourse.
The next exercise was straightfor
ward  what did people learn from 
society about gender roles? The list for 
women included not taking off their 
shirts in public and that women should 
be virgins until marriage although men 
need not be. An underlying theme 
throughout the mens list was that men 
weren't allowed to show emotions other 
than anger or strength.
In the evening session, participants 
broke up into small groups to discuss 
what it means to be a man. Ring and 
Kilmartin believed the groups would 
help the men to be more open. Its 
much harder to get men to talk. Weve 
been raised to hide our feelings. Its 
against the traditional masculine role 
to talk about what it is to be a man. 
There was a lot of initial resistance, 
said Ring.
Things that make you go hmm... II
ended with Ring and Kilmartin asking 
pointed questions about men and mas
culinity. Aware that the audience had 
several fraternity members present, 
they how they would feel if a member of 
a fraternity was gay. The crowd was 
silent except for one person who said he 
wouldnt mind since he lived in a town 
that had a large gay community.
Ring believes the two lectures have 
moved toward raising new perspectives 
toward gender roles. We have certainly 
raised a consciousness on this campus. 
Students everywhere are really inter
ested in these issues.
The presenters thought that both 
sessions were successful even though 
the mens session started slowly. There 
were a lot of technical conversations 
about the first exercise with the men, 
but it got to be pretty emotional, Ring
said. Its probably the first time some 
men talked about this [masculinity]. 
Kilmartin agrees that it was harder 
to get the men to display their feelings. 
We [Ring and Kilmartin] talked more 
in the second program, he said. We 
gave out more information, in order to 
initiate discussion with the partici
pants. We were trying to battle 15 
years of socialization.
Katie Stannard, assistant to the dean 
of Student Affairs, organized the two 
sessions. It [gender roles conflict] is a 
concern. Its an area that I think there 
hasnt been a lot of programs or wide
spread discussion about, except for 
things that the Womens Center and 
cmuOUT has done. Stannard believes 
these lectures are a good starting point 
for individual discussion and for future 
programs.
Influential artist and teacher remembered through his work
By KEVIN COONEY
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
The Hewlett Gallery, on the 
first floor of the College of Fine 
Arts building, will have works 
by Robert Lepper (1906-1991) 
on display from October 3 
through 31. Although Lepper 
was well known as an artist and 
teacher, not many Carnegie 
Mellon students know of this 
CMU alumnus.
Lepper graduated from Carn
egie Mellon in 1927 and became 
a member of the faculty in 1939. 
His influence in the Industrial 
Design Department was instru
mental at the time when the Art 
and Design Departments were 
not separate and the school was 
still known as Carnegie Tech. 
He was a speaker for the Art 
Department but also was in
volved in many other aspects of 
the University, including phi
losophy.
As a teacher, Lepper had a 
great impact. He instructed fa
mous artists such as Andy 
Warhol, Philip Pearlstein, and 
Mel Bochner; biographers be
lieve that he had an incredible 
influence on these artists.
He was really [well] known 
and very active as an artist and 
a teacher, said Patricia 
Villalobos, Hewlett Gallery Co
ordinator.
Lepper experimented with 
many different media. He be
gan doing murals  some as 
large as 22 by 80 feet  many 
depicting industry and the ef
fects of machines. Later, he ex
perimented^with aluminum, how 
planes look in space, and kinetic 
and interactive works of art.
He was the first person known 
to experiment with the concept 
of interactive art, constructing a 
huge work called Astrobat. 
People could come up and move 
all the levers and move all these
panels, said Villalobos. He 
made acrylic resin paintings 
(melted acrylic on acrylic me
dia), and looked at ways to fas
ten planes together without put
ting them on each other.
Lepper also had much influ
ence through his writings. 
There were 12 boxes full of 
things this guy wrote, said 
Villalobos. Lepper wrote, We 
see all visual phenomena 
through seven qualities which i 
may be termed the elements of 
visual perception. These are: 
line, area, volume, space, value, 
texture, and color. These quali
ties are fundamental in art 
courses across the United States.
Monument and the scrapheap 
are historically reciprocal, he 
wrote. Examples of this phenom
ena are the Parthenon, though 
not considered very important 
in its time, has become a concep
tually different object andis now 
considered a great work of ar
RUNNING SCARED?
Others are too. Graduate school can be a tough 
experience. Two psychiatrists from Western Psychiatric 
Institute and Clinic are inviting you to join a group of 
graduate students who are trying to understand changes in 
their lives. The group will meet once a week for one hour 
at the Counseling and Student Development Center at 
Carnegie Mellon during the academic year.
If you are interested in sharing your experience with others, 
help yourself and help them, please contact Lynn Daly at 
the Counseling center (268-2922).

chitecture. Lepper believed that 
todays scrapheaps might well 
become tomorrows monuments, 
and that the opposite could 
equally happen.
Lepper, although serious 
when refering to his papers, 
could be very humorous at times. 
Art need not be pompously, pon
derously, portentously humor
less, he wrote in his last work, 
a proposal for a sculpture in 
downtown Pittsburgh. The 
sculpture of a dragon, with torso 
and arms that looked like large 
springs, had large bulging eyes 
that would blink different colors 
to create an illusion of move
ment.
The Hewlett Gallery will show 
32 to 35 pieces of Leppers work, 
including a study for one of his 
murals. Works will be borrowed 
from The Carnegie Museum, 
Westmorland County Museum 
of Art, and Philip Rostek. Most 
of his works, however, will be

loaned by his daughter, Susan 
Lepper. Many of the works have 
been reconditioned by former 
student Jim Nelson. Funding 
was provided by Russel J.
Cameron, a Carnegie Mellon 
1941 alumnus and a former stu
dent of Lepper. There will be a 
public reception on Saturday, 
October 26, from 6 to 8 pm.

Senior Michael Siracusano portrays young political prisoner Leslie Williams in The Hostage.

with Leslie, played by senior Michael Siracusano.

The CMU Drama Departments preniere show of the season, The Hostage, 
[opened this past Saturday night at 
jresge Theatre. The play celebrates 
'ilife through songs and dances  and 
Isome corny jokes  while convincing 
[he audience of the inanity of war. Di
rector Barbara MacKenzie-Woodbeaufully delivers the swinging Irish romp 
 so that the painful realities of war hit, 
' and hit hard, exactly as the author 
Intended. And the actors are so ener
getic and inviting, so human and whole, 
that the short curtain call is not nearly 
enough time to thank them for such a 
wonderful evening at the theatre.
The Hostage, written by Brendan 
Behan, is the story of a young English 
; soldier captured by the Irish Republi[ can Army (IRA) and held hostage in a 
Dublin brothel. The soldier Leslie is 
leld under armed guard in reprisal for 
1 the hanging of another young man, a 
inember of the IRA who shot and killed 
a police officer.
> As Leslie charms the young house
keeper Teresa and the rest of the zany 
 household with his easy-going manner, 
a bond grows between him and his 
captors. But the friendship is compli
cated when Leslie discovers his true
 'circumstances  hes not just being 
: held captive; hes being held so he can 
be executed. In getting to know the 
person Leslie, the author makes it 
larder for us to let the soldier Leslie 
perish. Brendan Behan uses our sympathies and our intellects to point out 
;o us that war should have no place in 
the world.
Leading the cast of gifted young acI tors is senior Michael Siracusano, who 
plays Leslie Williams, the English sol
dier captured in Belfast.' Siracusanos 
Derformance is captivatinghis playl smile and boyish energy combineI
 perfectly into not only a believable char
ter, but also a believable hero. Its his 
nocent stare that captures the esnce of youth and that makes his fate 
a prisoner devastating. Without the 
refree, jubilant nature of the soldier 
islie, the plays anti-war message 
)uld not be nearly as strong. 
Siracusano proves himself a talented 
iger as well, and during a particurly defiant speech about his homend, England, displays other dimen)ns of youth  disillusionment, consion, and resulting anger. Truly, 
racusano delivers a brilliant perforance.
Junior Donna Champlin plays Teresa, 
the young maid in the house with a

light and angelic singing voice. 
Champlins Teresa is the perfect counter 
to Siracusanos Leslie, and as the two 
develop interest in each other, a subtle 
but beautiful transformation takes 
place onstage. Leslie and Teresa listen 
to each other, and respond, with amaz
ing honesty. Their flirting scenes work 
well because Teresa is quick to smile at 
Leslies charming openness. In a story 
Teresa relates about a mixed infant 
at her convent school, Champlins focus 
is impeccable. She can sing, she can act, 
and during pre-show and intermission, 
Champlin shows she can even dance.
Another energetic beam onstage is 
Monsewer, the 70-year-old owner of 
the brothel, played by senior Chadley 
Kelderman. Posture-perfect, Kelderman keeps his movements sharp and 
his British accent consistent through
out the whole show. His characteriza
tion could not be clearer, especially in 
his song when his very telling counte
nance perfectly and hilariously ani
mates his characters almost Victorian 
righteousness. At the basis of the char
acter is Keldermans sense of humor, 
and above all else hes fun to watch 
onstage because hes having fun.
Miss Gilchrist, the sociable worker 
for Saint Vincent DePaul, is played by 
senior Beth Zumann. She is the defini
tion of Christian pureness and all of 
Zumanns actions work toward that 
goal. Shes upright and sincere in her 
prayers  head tilted upward toward 
her Lord, eyes squinted, and songs bel
lowed out in her electrocutionisttrained voice. She moves with direct
ness, even when flirting, which results 
in a distinctly defined caricature. 
Zumann is perfect for her role.
The two characters who run the 
household are Meg Dillon and Pat, 
played by seniors Kelly Bertrand and 
Michael Fuller, respectively. For her 
role, Bertrand adopts a sturdy gait and 
a husky, matronly voice that, without 
words, describe the toughened life Meg 
Dillon has led. Her common sense is 
immediately established due to her re
markable diction.
Fuller plays Megs "more-or-less" 
husband, Pat. Always coming to atten
tion at Monsewers entrance, and al
ways announcin these songs that he
never gets around to singing, Pat is a 
little rough on the surface, but inside 
he has a soft and giving heart. Fuller 
plays his part with fantastic comic tim
ing and a gentle sense of vulnerability.
Directorially, Barbara MacKenzieWoodhas done sensationally. Shes tied 
together comedy, mirth, laughter, and 
joy with the suddenly jarring reality of 
Leslies fate. Shes kept accents consis
tentnot just so one character sounds 
the same throughout the play, but also, 
and just as importantly, so that all 
characters from the same region in Ire
land sound as though they are from the 
same region in Ireland. That task is not 
always appreciated, but in The Hostage 
its necessary and because its welldone, it is effective.
Although pacing occasionally drags, 
for the most part, the plays dynamics 
are choreographed well. Intense mo
ments are very much distinguished from 
the comic or joyous moments. The set, 
costumes, and action onstage are all 
unified under MacKenzie-Woods di
rection.
Technically, the show is superb. Cos
tumes are workable and befitting of the 
era. The set is dynamite  multi-leveled and efficient, the stage is a sensa
tional representation of a Dublin slum 
house. Even the bed upstage seems to 
be caving inwhat attention to detail! 
The lights are warm and highlight the 
wooden atmosphere of the set perfectly. 
At times, light even falls on the audi
ence, developing further the presenta
tional nature of the play. Near the end, 
a random-looking sequence of colored 
light-flashes creates the frenzied feel
ing of total chaos necessary to tie the 
audience in with the scene.
The only drawback to the whole play 
is the at-times harried political story 
creating the central conflict. Although 
some effort is made in the script to keep 
the audience straight on the informa.tion necessary in understanding the 
story  as at one point Pat interrupts 
his song to explain G.P.O.  the fastpaced tale weaves on ahead and its a
slight struggle to keep up with who are 
the bad guys and who are the good 
guys. But then again, perhaps that is 
the playwrights point  if, in a war, 
the good are indistinguishable from the 
bad, maybe there should not even be a 
war.
With written-in potential to go to
- great heights, and with a brilliant team 
of theatre folk to realize its potential, 
The Hostage is electrifying. For an en
tertaining evening of romp and realiza
tion, visit the Kresge and have some 
enlightening and artistic fun.Freddys Dead ho hum, what else is new?

screenwriter. The story line is 
comparable to a roll of toilet pa
per; rearranging its component 
segments wouldnt have any 
memorable effect, and you only 
really notice it at all when youve 
come to the end. The acting is 
inspirational to drama majors 
with career anxiety. And the dia
logue sounds like it came from 
few hasty servings of Alphabits.
The story purportedly takes 
place 10 years in the future, but 
beyond a perfunctory mention 
at the beginning of the movie, 
this fact has no further bearing 
upon the plot. Thats okay, how
ever, because neither really does 
anything else that happens af
terwards. John, the lone survi
vor of Freddys Springfield blood
bath, is whisked into an orphan
age where a sympathetic if pro
fessionally questionable psy
chiatrist, Maggie, decides that 
it would be therapeutic to take 
him back home to the site of 
thousands of grizzly murders. 
Three additional teenage ex
pendables grant themselves out
patient status and tag along for 
the ride.
Freddys most pervasive abil
ity seems to be the twisting of
human motivation into advanc
ing the plot. Upon finding the 
three stowaways, Maggie re
bukes them sternly, then tosses 
them the keys and orders them 
to drive back, unaccompanied, 
to the ward. These otherwise 
intelligent teenagers decide that 
the safest thing to do when 
stranded in a demon-infested 
town is to stay overnight in an 
abandoned house, sleeping in 
isolation from one another. One 
wonders why they didnt feel the 
urge to paint targets on their 
chests or sprinkle themselves 
with herbal seasoning.
Meanwhile, Marcy and John, 
local teens, discover from a in
formative psychotic that 
. Freddys rampages started when 
his child was taken from him 
years ago. Of course, we later 
learn that Freddy had a stack of 
butchered preschoolers in his 
wine cellar before his daughter 
was confiscated, so we are left to 
infer some deeper motivation for 
these preliminary killings. Such 
plot twists only confirm our ad
miration of Freddy as a psycho
logically complex character.

We are then treated to a brief 
pathological biography of 
Freddy. Most memorable is a 
childhood scene wherein a young

capable of training 30 kids to

enough to send me lobbing limbs

Romeo
By MARY YEE
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Renowned for being one of the 
most popular and enduring clas
sical ballets, Romeo and Juliets 
romantic story will sweep you 
off your feet again when the 
Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre opens 
its season with Shakespeares 
tragicjRomeo and Juliet. Perfor
mances are the Benedum Cen
ter this Thursday to Sunday.
The ballet has three acts. Act
I opens with the ball that Lord 
Capulet has planned for his 
daughter, Juliet. On that fateful 
night, Romeo and Juliet fall in 
love at first sight.
Act II opens with romance still 
in the air. Romeo and Juliet, 
though very young, want to get 
married as soon as possible. 
However, because of the wellknown friction between their 
families, the Montagues and the 
Capulets, the couple plans to 
wed secretly with the help of 
Friar Laurence.
In the meantime, a fight en
sues in the market between 
Juliets cousin Tybalt and 
Romeos best friend Mercutio, 
who is unintentionally killed. 
The tragedy of the story begins 
here, when Romeo avenges the 
death of his friend by killing 
Tybalt. As a result of this action, 
Romeo is banished by the Prince 
of Verona.
Act III opens with the lovers 
first weddiiij night together, but 
Romeo must escape from Verona 
afterwards. Later that same day, 
Lord and Lady Capulet an
nounce Juliets engagement to 
Tybalts kinsman, Paris. Juliet 
accepts Paris proposal though 
she cannot marry him. She takes 
a sleeping potion that imitates 
death in order to run away with 
Romeo.
Unfortunately, Romeo does

not know of her plan. When he 
arrives at her funeral, hes 
stricken with grief and decides 
to join the one he loves. Juliet 
wakes from her sleep and turns 
to find her lover has sacrificed 
his life for her. She impulsively 
commits suicide to be with him. 
Together they close the circle of 
love in their eternity.
Known for her creative style, 
Artistic Director Patricia Wilde 
has played one of the key roles in 
promoting the reputation of the 
Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre. As a 
former principal dancer of 
Balanchines New York City 
Ballet company, she has com
mitted her time to expanding 
the repertoire of the Pittsburgh 
Ballet company. This season 
promises to enchant audiences 
and make them cry for more.
In addition to Bruce Wells pro
duction of Romeo and Juliet, 
upcoming ballets in the reper
toire include Balanchines The 
Nutcracker and Apollo, and 
Agnes de Milles Fall River Leg
end.
Romeo and Juliet's choreog
rapher Wells claims, There is a 
Romeo and Juliet in every cho
reographer, but its a once-in-alifetime opportunity. Patricia 
Wilde was looking for someone 
to open Romeo and Juliet. She 
invited me to choreograph the 
ballet when she heard of my 
success from A Midsummer 
Night's Bream. Wells other cel
ebrated works include La Fille 
Mai Gardee, which premiered 
in China in 1980, Swan Lake, 
and The Nutcracker.
In addition to choreographing 
for the Pittsburgh Ballet The
atre, Wells was a soloist with 
the New York City Ballet com
pany and an associate director 
and resident choreographer for 
the Boston Ballet company. Cho
reographing has taken him to a 
different level of challenge than 
performing. As a choreographer, 
he perceives his creations as the 
audience would. No longer is he 
only the performer in the foot
lights. The action behind each 
movement must be brushed with 
an aggressive stroke.
I am more involved in the 
visual impact of the entire pro
duction. I concentrate on emo
tional dancing and creativity, 
says Wells. There is a greater 
involvement wholistically, with 
the production performance, and 
individually with each dancer. 
As gf choreographer, everything 
begins with you. You are the 
nucleus. You are the seed. You 
are the key. As a dancer, you 
spend more time in dance classes 
and rehearsals backstage. As a 
choreographer, you design the 
role to fit into each performer.
What makes this Romeo and 
Juliet unique is Wells style. I 
stay away from the inevitable 
tragedy of Romeo and Juliet for 
as long as possible, says Wells. 
In the opening scene, people 
come out of a ball drunken with 
love in the air. In fact, tragedy is 
held off until the end of Act II 
upon Mercutios death. I try to 
create an emotional arc as high 
as possible, theatrically, to pre
pare the audience for the pre

cipitous anticlimax.
Over time Romeo and Juliet 
has been interpreted in many 
different ways by those who have 
produced it. Unlike most short 
ballets, Romeo and Juliet is a 
large ballet with many charac
ter relationships. This gives the 
choreographer much to work 
with.
There are layers of different 
emotional relationships, such as 
those between Lady and Lord 
Capulet, Mercutio and Romeo, 
and Juliet and her nurse, says 
Wells. This complexity adds a 
unique flavor of challenge for 
those involved in Romeo and 
Juliet.
Balanchine, as my mentor, 
has influenced me in musicality, technique, and approach. I 
was guided by Jerome Robbins 
theatrical talents for drama in 
complementing stage as support 
system for storytelling. Other 
notable directors, such as 
Frederick Ashton and Jiri 
Kylian, have also influenced me 
with their creativity and style.
The actions involved in per
formances are what define the 
character.
This is why the art of dancing 
is so dramatically effective and 
powerful. In .Romeo and Juliet, 
the suicide action of the lovers 
and their untimely deaths com
bine to make the ballet one that 
consumes the emotions of our 
audiences. It is this untimely 
death that augments the trag
edy of youthfulness wasted, 
says Wells.
Another reason to see Romeo 
and Juliet, besides the wonder
ful directing and choreograph
ing, is the parallel it draws to 
young people today.
The inability to control the 
circumstances that surround 
Romeo and Juliet in their family 
conflict leads to the demise of

In this new television season, 
among all the talk shows, com
edies, confessionals, and tab
loids, one genre has been notice
ably absent: the game show. Not 
one new game premiered this 
fall, while several (at least eight, 
in fact) were cancelled last sea
son. It appears that game shows 
are on their way out.
. No w, I know that m any of you 
arent shedding any tears over 
this fact. Game shows dont get 
much respect. Admittedly, the 
last few new game shows werent 
very exciting, sometimes be
cause of the premise (Trump 
Card and Quiz Kids Challenge, 
for example) and other times 
because of the host (Patrick 
Wayne? Give me a break!).
There are only seven game 
shows currently on the networks 
or in syndication. Most of these 
have been on forever (Wheel of 
Fortune) or are updates of shows 
that were on several years ago 
CFamily Feud and $100,000 
Pyramid). The only two pro
grams that are the least bit origi. nal are more confessional than 
. game: Love Connection and the 
! new Studs.
However, I havent given up 
hope for a game show resur
gence. Sure, the times are lean 
now, but soon well realize that 
we miss the simple pleasures 
game shows once brought us.
Think back  didnt you used 
to watch and enjoy game shows? 
Sure you did Tnthe 70s, quizzes 
and celebrity panels dominated 
the daytime and evening sched
ules. Lets look back to a time 
when game shows were king.
When I was a kid, the best 
part about being home sick from 
; school was catching my favorite 
; game show Hollywood Squares 
started off the morning. Host 
Peter Marshall was a bit of a 
square himself, but that was
THE LAUGH TRACK
by A. Franklin Wheeler
okay because the celebrities were 
so cool (or at least I thought so). 
The regular squares became 
like a pseudo-family: George 
Gobel, Rose Marie, and Paul 
Lynde in the center square. And 
the other special guest squares 
made it even better. It seems 
every celebrity in Hollywood 
made at least one appearance as 
an X or an 0.
The game itself was absurdly 
simplethe contestants played 
tic-tac-toe by guessing whether 
or not a celebrity answered a 
question correctly. But the fun 
came in the celebrities answers: 
rarely would Marshall get a 
straightforward reply on the first 
try. Okay, maybe the answers 
were scripted beforehand, but 
that didnt really matter. This 
was a showcase for comedians 
and performers, some on the way 
up, some on the way down, but 
very funny either way.
If I was lucky, Squares would 
be followed by another silly ce
lebrity panel show, Match Game. 
A grinning Gene Rayburn em
ceed this one, where contestants 
tried to match their answers 
with those of the celebrity panel.
The panel on Match Game gen
erally seemed a bit more rau
cous and risqu than that on 
Squares. For game-show com
edy with bite, this was the place 
to go. The celebrity turnover was 
similar to that of Squares, with 
Brett Somers and Charles 
Nelson Reilly as regulars.
The coolest thing about this 
game, though, was the set. At 
the beginning of the show, the 
contestants would spin out from 
the left, the celebrities from the 
right, and Rayburn would enter 
at center stage. And then, for 
the bonus round, Rayburn and 
the winning contestant would 
spin away to the bonus section 
of the set, waving goodbye to the 
celebrities as they went. Typical 
70s splendor? Sure, but it was 
neat.
Then there was Card Sharks. 
This was probably my favorite 
game. The host, Jim Perry, was 
the consummate emcee: cool, 
calm, and collected, yet still able 
to crack a joke at the appropri
ate time.
Plus the game was fun to 
watch. A contestant, after an
swering a relatively simple ques
tion, tried to move through a 
row of cards by guessing if the 
second card was higher or lower 
than the first. (For example, if a 
2 showed up, you could pretty 
much guarantee that the con
testant would be screaming, 
Higher, Jim! Higher!) And the 
bonus round, where the cham
pion tried to increase his or her 
winnings by going through three 
rows of higher/lower guessing, 
was indescribably cool. You could 
cut the tension with a knife.
Of course, the game show that 
I most associate with those sick 
days is the one thats been there 
the longest: The Price is Right. 
This game, one of the few survi
vors still on the network sched
ules, has changed hardly at all 
since 1972, when it premiered 
on CBS.
Oh, sure, they add a new pric
ing game every year or two, but 
the contestants still come on 
down, jumping, crying, and 
screaming. Bob Barkers still 
treated as a sex symbol of sorts,
if not a god, and the sets as 
cheesy as ever. Why has it sur
vived? Because its a great show. 
Its exciting, it keeps your inter
est, and Bob Barker  well, 
maybe he is a god.
I could go on and on with de
scriptions of great game shows: 
Cross-Wits; Jokers Wild, with 
the hosts host, Jack Barry; 
Name That Tune;Password with 
Allen Ludden; Tic Tac Dough; 
even Family Feud, with that in
famous kisser, Richard Dawson.
Of all these programs, only 
Barker and his Price crew have 
survived into the 90s. New ver
sions of Family Feud and 
$100,000 Pyramid are doing 
fairly well, but other comebacks 
have failed. Two victims last year 
were new versions of Tic Tac 
Dough and The Jokers Wild. 
Original ideas are scarce, and 
when new shows actually do get 
on the air, they seem doomed to 
failure.
Is America really sick of 
games? The answer, in my opin
ion, is a resounding no. The 
problem lies with the individual 
productions, not the genre as a 
whole. Put simply, every one of 
the new entries last year was 
really bad. Flashy sets couldnt 
cover up lousy hosts and hor
rible production values.
The two revivals that have 
worked, Feud and Pyramid, did 
not try to change the games. 
Everything about the games, 
including the sets and the for
mats, stayed the same. They 
were popular then, so why 
shouldnt they be popular now?
If theres a New Jokers Wild, 
for example, why cant the em
phasis be on Jokers Wild in
stead of New? Yes, even keep the 
cheesy 7Os setsand find some 
competent hosts! The problem 
here is not demand, its supply. 
People want to watch game
When I was a kid, the best part 
about being home sick from school 
was catching my favorite game 
shows.
shows, but there arent that 
many good ones to watch.
Recently, cable has presented 
itself as an alternative home for 
game shows. Lifetime broad
casts two simply horrid pro
grams, Supermarket Sweep and 
Shop Til YouDrop. They involve 
family shopping sprees and are 
incredibly hard to follow. Still, 
Lifetime should get credit for 
broadcasting game shows at all.
USANetworkhas been broad
casting repeats of old game 
shows for years. Its schedule now 
includes shows from the early to 
mid 80s, like Press Your Luck 
(Houseboat! No whammy, no 
whammy!), John Davidson and 
the new Hollywood Squares, 
and Dick Clarks $25,000 Pyra
mid.
Now, thats not a bad idea. 
With cable always expanding, 
how about a Game Show Chan
nel? It could broadcast those clas
sics from the 70s, corny music 
and all. And, of course, game 
shows have been a staple on TV 
since the 50s: we could finally 
see all the games that were on
before we were born.
Think about it  24 hours of 
tough quizzes and unrestrained 
goofiness, from the classics, such 
as You Bet Your Life and Whats 
My Line, through 60s staples 
like The (old) Price is Right and 
Beat the Clock, to the wonderful 
70s, with the good (Match Gama 
and Hollywood Squares), the bad 
{Almost Anything Goes), and the 
ugly (remember The $1.98 
Beauty Show?).
At least with a Game Show 
Channel, those game showjunkies among us could relive fond 
memories while waiting for the 
next Price is Right or Wheel of 
Fortune to appear.
And it will happen: Someday, 
a new game will come along that 
will recapture the love Ameri
cans once felt for game shows. 
Until then, we can only wait  
and remember.
Tartan senior staffwriter A. 
Franklin Wheeler is a senior pro
fessional writing major who 
misses the game shows of yester
year.

Breed Hall, Margaret Morrison College
Violent crime has been one of Philip Cooks research 
interests since 1975, when his work as a consultant to 
the U.S. Department of Justice demonstrated that gun 
availability has little effect on violent crime rates. It 
does, however, have a considerable effect on the 
likelihood that violent encounters will result in death. 
There is considerable evidence that the type of weapon 
matters a great deal, and that the newly emerging 
perspective on guns as a public health problem has 
merit. The challenge in designing an appropriate public 
policy response is to discourage dangerous uses of guns 
while preserving recreational uses. Cook is a member of 
the National Academy of Science Panel on the Under
standing and Control of Violence.
Free and open to the public.
It's an important, exciting mission that lends 
itself to some unique job opportunities.

Singing, dancing, and pure 
comic spoof are the main ingre
dients in the upcoming Scotch 
*N| Soda musical review, Another 
Round. The show is a celebra
tion of the performing groups 
85th anniversary and will high
light songs from productions of 
the last 50 years. Although the 
performance is only a half hour 
in length, the nationwide search 
for Scotch N Soda alumni with 
sh'eet music from early shows 
and limited rehearsal time made 
the show difficult to organize.
Songs from five shows will be 
used in the musical review, in
cluding Heres to You (1941), 
Pippin, Pippin (1967), Glitz 
(1976), This Is Not A Test (1989), 
and Trapped in the Silver Screen 
(1990). The tunes chosen to be 
performed in the new produc
tion will give audiences a feel for 
Scotch N Sodas past creations. 
For example, Goodbye, Yester
day from Pippin, Pippin dis
plays a young princes delibera
tion over becoming king, and 
End of the World Rag reflects 
the question posed in This Is 
Not A Test  what will be the 
human races reaction to the 
threat of worldwide destruction?
There are eight actors involved 
in the show, four men and four 
women. They include Megan 
Dietz and Peter Humer, both 
H&SS sophomores; Andy 
Folmer, a sophomore chemistry 
major; Karletta Raibon and J. 
Andrew Vaughan, CIT fresh
men; Crystal Trexel, a fresh
man IM major; Lynn Pausic, an 
MCS freshman; and Ricky 
Cheng, an H&SS freshman. The 
show is directed by senior cre
ative and professional writing 
major Mick Sutter and is cho Theater Preview 
ANOTHER ROUND. A musical reviewfeaturing songs from the past 
fifty years of Scotch N Soda 
productions.Directed Mick Sutter. 
Performances are Friday night at 
8:30 & 10:30 and Saturday night 
at 8:30 & 9:30 in the Wherrett 
Room.
reographed by Dawn Nebelkopf, 
an H&SS sophomore.
After almost 75 hours of re
hearsing and putting together 
the set, those involved in the 
production are almost prepared 
for opening night this Friday.
Its in the hands of the cast 
now. It is their determination 
and desire that is going to per
fect and sell it, says junior math/ 
CS major Michael Walker, presi
dent of Scotch N Soda.
As the final rehearsals ap
proach, perfection is becoming a 
reality. The rehearsal on Satur
day, was indicative of the poten
tial the musical review holds....
The eight-member cast is gath
ered in the Wherrett Room. Four 
are playing a mock game of foot
ball with a small pink ball, while 
three others stand near the stage 
talking quietly. Walker is at the 
piano with Cheng, helping him 
to perfect his solo in Goodbye, 
Yesterday.
You have to decide by the end 
of the song that you want to be 
king, Walker explains. You 
have to strengthen your voice in 
the end to show that you have 
made your decision.
Cheng starts the song again 
from the beginning, starting in 
a soft, anxious tone, building it 
up to a stronger one towards the 
end. After he has completed his 
song, the rest of the cast is called 
over to do the opening number.

Lets get as much done before 
you do this for the board, guys, 
says Sutter. He gets the cast to 
line up outside the door and goes 
through a practice introductory 
procedure as the cast trickles in 
to do the opening number.
In an improvisational man
ner, the cast performs the theme 
to Glitz. The song is catchy and 
very similar to some of Cole 
Porters more recent upbeat 
tunes. The casts movements are 
purposely discombobulated and 
unsynchronized. Humer flexes 
his muscles in a regular body
builder fashion while cast mem
bers, such as Trexel, look on, 
confused. At the end of the num
ber, the group forms a some
what awkward kick line which 
is sure to generate laughs from 
the audience.
All right, pretty good. Its get
ting better. Lets do Master of 
Disaster, End of the World Rag, 
and Heres to You  the rest 
well run through at the board 
preview, Walker says.
Folmer, Humer, Cheng, and 
Vaughan get ready for their 
quartet in Master of Disaster, 
from Trapped in the Silver 
Screen. Vaughan transforms 
himself into the typical old Hol
lywood villain who ties women 
to train tracks. He and his gang, 
Humer and Cheng, push Folmer 
around as Folmer sings about 
being a quintessential son of a 
bitch.
As the musical skit progresses, 
Humer and Cheng break away 
from their tough characteriza
tions to do some hilariously ef
feminate dance steps. They gy
rate their pelvises in the con
ventional Elvis style and do little 
steps that look something like 
the 1920s Charleston.
The End of the World Rag 
starts off with a bang as an allk1rt1g 2B kra, 
nil 111 111!

Dietz, Raibon, Trexel, and

should do before the earth is 
destroyed. Should they preoc
cupy themselves with waiting 
for the world to end, or should 
they enjoy the hours of living 
they have left?
Theres still some problems. 
You have to get comfortable with 
the notes, Walker says, walk
ing over to the women. Well 
work on that later. Right now 
lets getready forHeres to You.
Folmer staggers across the 
floor in a fake, drunken stupor 
as the group pretends to toast 
an audience with the appealing 
Heres to You. It is not as dy
namic as it would be if a larger 
group performed the number, 
but the eight people involved 
fulfill their potential in project
ing their voices. The enthusi

Freddy's Dead  thank God
FREDDY, from page L9
primary reason for this is that 
Freddy is just plain hysteri
cal. Kreuger has taken artful 
massacre to a new plateau, 
ofteriacting with more convic
tion than the monotonous sup
porting cast. Which would you 
rather watch: a clot of morose, 
despondent people who 
vaguely remind you of people 
from high school, or a grin
ning maniac disemboweling 
them all while spouting ur
bane one-liners?
Freddys comedic on
slaughts have become his 
trademark, as well as the only 
conceivable justification of any 
of these movies beyond the 
third. Freddy snaps a hapless 
teenagers parachute risers, 
then diligently pushes a bed 
of foot-long nails below him, 
wiping sweat from his brow 
and sighing with exhaustion 
to the audience. He reclines at
a spiderweb-encrusted video 
game console, twisting a joy
stick and making his victim 
whisk around with Marioesque jerkiness. Kids, 
Freddy complains, just before 
hes blown into fragments. 
Nice hearing from ya, he 
chides, dangling a severed ear 
from his claws. Can you stand 
it?
This movie is unabashed 
swill, but its fun unabashed 
swill, and a great flick to en
joy with four or more friends 
whose collective IQ doesnt ex
ceed your own. Catch a dis
count matinee if you must, 
but dont miss this opportu
nity to see one of the most 
vigorously milked cows of 
Hollywood turn in its horns. 
Freddy really does die this 
time, and I think it would be a 
good idea for everyone to head 
for the theaters just to make 
sure.

Citizen Kane
Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts ab
solutely. Citizen Kane, Orson Welles brilliant 1941 
release, is one of the clearest depictions of this 
maxim in the film world. With rather pointed paral
lels to the life of newspaper tycoon William Randolph 
Hearst, the film tells the story of Charles Foster 
Kane, a man driven by ambition and haunted by 
Rosebud. This simple word, uttered from the lips 
of a dying man, spurred a young reporter to delve 
into Kanes past through interviews with those left 
behind. The film, considered extremely controver
sial at the time, was recalled from distribution and 
not re-released until after Hearsts death.
From the directing and acting  handled with 
genius by Welles and an excellent cast  to the 
revolutionary film techniques, Citizen Kane is con
sidered one of the most important films ever made. 
If youve seen it, you know that the experience is 
worth a dollar. If you havent yet had the pleasure, 
take the time ll9minutes and spend the buck, 
because Citizen Kane is a must see.

The Doors
Jim Morrison lives! And you can see him when 
The Doors comes to DH 2210 this weekend. Acad
emy Award-winning director Oliver Stone completes 
the final chapter in his trilogy of the 60s with this 
vivid portrait of the sex, drugs, and rock n roll 
rampant in that colorful era.
The Doors traces the wild and lustful life of Jim 
Morrison from 1965, as lead singer of the Doors, 
unti his death in France in 1971. Radiant and 
passionate, the film portrays the 60s with splashes 
of brilliantly photographed scenes and a deluge of 
the unique music that made Jim Morrison known 
throughout the world.
The Doors proves to be an exhilarating master
piece of cinematic know-how. Go see it.

What About Bob?
If you like the type of film in which you can turn 
your brain off and still enjoy, then What About Bob ? 
is the film for you.
Bill Murray plays Bob, a man with so many crazy 
phobias youll wonder how this guy can even eat his 
breakfast without fear. Richard Dreyfuss plays 
Murrays doctor, Leo Marvin, a stuck up, rich psy
chiatrist who doesnt seem to care about anything 
except making money and becoming famous. After 
Dreyfuss cures Murray of his fear of public places 
in five minutes, Murray decides that he cant live a 
day without Dreyfuss advice. However, Dreyfuss 
has recently gone on vacation and wont be back for 
another month. Murray doesnt have a problem 
with this though, because he just decides to track 
down Dreyfuss and live with him. During the rest of 
the film we get to watch Murray slowly become 
cured of all his phobias, while Dreyfuss develops 
them. If it wasnt for the really stupid ending, this 
movie would have been a classic comedy.
So, check this film out this Saturday night if 
youre in the mood for a stupid comedy.

Rebel Without A Cause

odd friends find the comfort in each other that they 
can find no place else.
A motivating force of the Beat generation in the 
50s and an overwhelming inspiration for the youth 
of the 60s, Rebel Without A Cause made a place for 
itself in the social history of America. It will make a 
place for itself in your heart when you watch it this

The Mask redefines vigilante comic books
Oh no, not another vigilante 
comic book, yon say? What sepa
rates this gun-toting megaloma
niac from all the other violent 
hosses that are littered through
out the comic world?
Well, for starters, this one, 
titled The Mask, has a some
what interesting premise. Meet 
Lt. Kellaway, a stand up sort of 
guy who still believes in the pu
rity of the law. Hes a clich cop 
who loves to sip coffee, munch 
on donuts, and go home to his 
lonely duplex and eat week-old 
tuna salad. Its a frustrating 
world for our dear cop pal, for 
there are political forces hover
ing above the law, thwarting any 
progress he may ever make.
Hes broken-armed and disil
lusioned when a young woman 
walks into his office one fine 
morning. On her shoulder hangs 
a bag, containing a peculiar item, 
an item that will change Lt. 
Kellaways life forever! Its the 
Mask, a macabre brooding face 
that looks like it belongs in the 
Aztec exhibit. The young gal 
explains that this mask is the 
cause behind last months mys
terious big-head murders. She 
shuffles off, but not before warn
ing the lieutenant never to put 
the mask on!
Like movies, any scene in a 
comic book has a tendency to set 
the tone, texture, and feel of the 
entire series. From one inter
change, the limitations and ex
pectations of the book can be 
surmised. This opening scene 
establishes The Mask as being 
farcical in nature. It is a book 
held together by exclamation 
marks and over-acting, if such a 
thing is possible in comics.
The artwork is characterdriven, often resembling the 
works of comic artists like Dave 
Gibbons of Watchmen fame or 
Bryan Talbott. It is art that is

part conventional, yet manages 
to add a distinct wobble that 
gives The Mask a unique flavor. 
Writer John.Arcude, known for 
his Aliens stories, and artist 
Doug Mahnke have created a 
cohesive, well-paced book that 
is worthy of your attention.
But back to the story! The tired 
lieutenant, skeptical ofwhatthe 
young woman has to say, re
turns home and puts the mask 
on. The book then speedily 
switches gears, as this once con
servative and almost boring 
character becomes a savagely 
absurd, psychotic reflection of 
himself. The mask has found 
another victim to possess, our 
dear police hero, and its quite 
ugly when the mask regains life.
Soon, his broken arm quickly 
heals as he discovers that this 
mask gives him the power of 
healing, thus invulnerability. If 
someone shoots a bullet through 
his head, he just chuckles aloud 
as his head regenerates. There 
is simply no stopping The Mask\
So now super cop starts his 
tour of the city, crushing bad 
guys and their kind with a hi
larious, painless ease. But hes 
got bigger fish to fry, this in
credulous Mask person does. 
While he was a normal guy our 
hero was at the mercy of a tainted 
law, a once-pure entity that is 
now the plaything of the rich 
and power- hungry. But no more! 
The Mask has no such limita
tions! And so the hunt begins for
1991 Dark Horse Comics, Inctj; 
Its good to see that The Mask hasn't lost his sense of humor.
the head drug dealer who has 
eluded a crippled laws bruised 
fingers.
Can anything stop this psy
chotic, invulnerable creature 
which can mold his body and 
anything he touches into an ex
tension of his frazzled imagina
tion? (Perhaps it will be the very 
ideals that he is smashing heads 
for that will be his undoing!)
For into the second issue of 
The Mask, our grinning floob 
pretty much splatters the big 
bad guy all over the wall. But 
theres a witness to this bighead murder, and when Lt. 
Kellaway returns home, he 
learns that he has been assigned 
to bring the big-head murderer
to justice.
Will he turn himself in or will  
the dark, sweet taste of power1 
consume the proud, decent man - 
who has dedicated his existence 
to good karma? You only have 
four issues to find out, for The' 
Mask is, sadly, only a limited 
series.
Perhaps its success will breed-; 
future tales of mania and non
stop comedy!
