Board presents recommendations
By EDWARD HAYES
Tartan Staffwriter
The Space Allocation Board (SAB) has made 
their recommendations on which organizations 
will receive offices in the former Naval Reserve 
Center on Forbes Avenue when Skibo Hall is de
molished to make way for the University Center. 
The recommendations were presented to Assistant 
Director of Student Activities Bonnie Gorman. 
Gorman will submit them to Michael Murphy, 
dean of student affairs, for final approval.
CMU acquired the Naval Reserve Center after 
the Navy moved out last fall. With the demolition 
of Skibo, it is necessary to move student offices to 
another location. The Space Allocation Board is a 
group of students, assembled from volunteers, to 
decide which organizations would be given offices 
in the new location.
The Naval building is located next to Hamburg 
Hall. It is smaller than Skibo, said Murphy. 
There are fewer offices, but they are considerably 
larger. This will result in some organizations 
sharing an office, said Murphy, but he feels that
shouldnt be a problem.
The building is currently under renovation. Whe 
the repairs are done, the building will be accessibl 
from the Cut. [The Naval building] will be as 
central as Skibo, Murphy said. He feels that the 
student body will not be inconvenienced much 
when the transition occurs.
When Navy personnel moved to the new Naval 
Reserve Center in North Versailles, CMU bought 
the building for use as office space and classrooms. 
From that point on, the SAB began working on 
putting together a recommendation. They first 
started by writing to the various student organiza!- 
tions and requiring them to apply for a space.
Then they ranked the applications based on 
need, history and benefit to the school. The ones 
that ranked high were granted office space. Most*, 
if not all, organizations that requested space got 
it. said Tim Mallo, a graduate student and a 
member of the committee.
After going through all the applications, th 
board decided on which organizations would move 
into the Naval building. Some organizations whose

CMU, union still lack common ground
By DECLAN McCULLAGH
far tan Staffwriter
The 14-month battle of wills between Carnegie 
dellon University and Service Employees Interlational Union Local 29 escalated last week, with 
joth sides firing increasingly bitter volleys at each 
other after the union voted to reject the 
Administrations latest proposal and authorize a 
trike, which could be held as soon as this week.
SEIU Local 29 represents full-time workers in 
Dining Services, Physical Plant, and ABM.
Neither side seems about to give up any ground 
n this skirmish. In a letter sent to the union last 
iriday, the administration made clear its unwillngness to grant further concessions, leaving the 
iext move in the hands of the union, which could 
esult in the first labor strike in the 95-year history 
ofthe University.
If the union strikes, the loss of over 100 workers 
bight temporarily cripple certain areas of the 
'university, a threat the union is counting on to lend 
Weight to its presence behind the bargaining table. 
The area most affected could be Dining Services, 
which feeds thousands of students a day.
Restricted food service would be a tremendous 
inconvenience, said Talia Sofer, an MCS fresh
man who says she eats on campus almost all the 
ime. If they cut off food service, things would be 
quite a bit harder. I would probably go shopping 
and get more food to make in my apartment.
The latest cause for acrimony in the drawn-out 
negotiations between the union and the university 
'was the provisions outlined in the administrations
proposed con
tract  a com
plex document 
that promised 
the workers a 
sizable signing 
bonus, while at 
the same time 
requiring them 
to pay up to 
three times 
more for health 
care coverage.
The main rea
son, however,

On motion to revoke IVCF recognition...
Senate maintains status quo
By JENNIFER FORBES
Tartan Copy Staff
After much controversy and discus
sion, Student Senate voted last Tuesday 
to retain the recognition of InterVarsity 
Christian Fellowship (IVCF). The motionto remove recognition was dismissed 
in a close vote of 7112.
Senates motion to remove the recog
nition came after the Space Allocation 
Board, formed to allocate space to stu
dent organizations in the former Naval 
Reserve Center on Forbes Avenue, dis
covered that to become an officer in 
IVCF, one must sign a statement testi
fying that one is a Christian.
The general feeling among the partici
pants of the debate was mixed.
The members of IVCF were relieved 
by the decision. Cheryl Mendenhall, a 
junior design major and president of 
IVCF, said, Im happy with [the deci
sion], I think it was a good debate  
pretty unemotional, and very logical and 
reasonable.
Senior IM major Crystal Trexel, Sen
ate Funding and Recognition chair, felt 
differently. The debate wasnt focused 
on the topic. The issue was the guide
lines for recognition. It went off the topic 
which hurt the debate, she said.
Erik Altmann, a member of the Space 
Allocation Board and computer science
grad student, felt that the revision ofthe 
Senate bylaws to include a non-discrimi
nation clause has muddied the issue.
If I had known the non-discrimina
tion clause would have been this misin
terpreted, I never would have supported 
it, said Altmann. It was very clear ... 
The [new] language confused people 
about what was in violation.
Both Trexel and Altmann see this de
cision as setting a potentially dangerous 
precedent for Senate.
It adds a new way around the rules, 
said Trexel. If this [discrimination] is 
OK, then other organizations that say 
you must believe in [something] have a

More apathy marks election re-run
By FRANK MICHELS
Tartan Personnel Manager
Only 11 petitions were submitted for 29 available seats in 
this semesters Student Senate election, according to Jim 
Albert, chair of the Elections Board. This election takes the 
place of Novembers election, which was invalidated by the 
Elections Board because a list of write-in candidates was 
circulated at the voting table.
The election for new Senators is scheduled for Monday, 
February 7, through Wednesday, February 9, from 9 am to 5t
n in front of Doherty Hall or in Kiltie Court, depending on 
eather conditions.
At press time, only nine of the 11 petitions were validated by 
ie Elections Board. Because so few petitions were received 
with so many seats open, as the situation now stands, the 
School of Computer Science will be the only college with filled 
seats on Student Senate.
; In SCS, there are two candidates for two seats.
I think the elections will be typical, said Albert. Unfor
tunately, there is.no competition. It will be hard to draw a 
lot of voters/*
At Novembers election, 917 votes were cast that would 
have resulted in graduate students filling vacant Student 
Senate seats in every college except IM and CFA.
The election was first invalidated by the original Elec-, 
tions Board, chaired by alumnus David Martin, who re
cently graduated with a bachelors degree in psychology. 
Martin could not be reached for comment.
On November 18, Student Senate held a special session 
and overrode its own election rules to have a then newlyappointed Elections Board decide to invalidate the elections 
[Battle marks special session, 11/22/93].
We [the Elections Board] are going to be careful to make 
sure we dont violate the rules, said Albert. There will be 
no mention of write-in candidates at the table.

Mandela, de Klerk 
kick off campaigns
SOWETO, South Africa, January
29 (LAT-WP)  Black leader Nelson 
Mandela laid out his partys ambi
tious plans for social justice and eco
nomic reform Saturday on a day that 
essentially kicked off the political cam
paign for this nations first multira
cial democratic elections.
Dressed in a dashiki and sporting a 
broad grin, Mandela rode a 14-car 
freedom train filled with flag-waving supporters to present the platform 
of his African National Congress 
(ANC) to nearly 1,000 diplomats and 
business, ethnic, and religious lead
ers in a convention center at the edge 
of this sprawling black township.
The ANC is ready to govern, said 
the 75-year-old Mandela on a stage 
framed by arches of green, black, and 
gold balloons  the ANCs colors  
and a huge banner with, the partys 
new slogan: A Better Life for All. 
President Frederick W. de Klerk, 
Mandelas chief opponent in the vot
ing scheduled to take place in three 
months, will present his partys plat
form Wednesday atthe National Party 
convention in Kempton Park.
De Klerk finished a three-day cam-, 
paign swing Saturday, seeking sup
port from blacks in rural townships
east of Johannesburg. But his rallies 
and speeches were repeatedly marred 
when hecklers either shouted him 
down or threatened supporters of the 
National Party, which created and en
forced apartheid.
The National Party is the real party 
of peace, de Klerk shouted into a 
microphone Saturday. The ANC is 
the party of conflict. Several hundred 
ANC supporters blocked a road, 
chanted and sang to drown him out 
when he opened a party office in the 
township of Mzinoni.
De Klerk has increasingly ham
mered that theme in hopes of painting 
the ANC as an organization that spon
sors intimidation and terrorism in the 
townships.
Mandela, in turn, has lashed out at 
de Klerk for not controlling the mostly 
black-on-black violence that has left 
more than 13,000 people dea'd since 
the dismantling of apartheid began in 
February 1990. He also accuses him of 
trying to bury the past. There are 
those who would like us to believe that 
the past doesnt exist, that decades of 
apartheid rule have suddenly disap
peared, he said Saturday, but the 
economic and social devastation of 
apartheid remains.
Debate over direction of Russian economy goes on
DAVOS, Switzerland, January 29 
(LAT-WP)Russian Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin, who at home 
has sought to dilute moves toward a 
free-market economy, told a confer
ence here Saturday that his new gov
ernment will pursue vigorous market 
reforms.
Chernomyrdin sought to rebut do
mestic and foreign critics who have 
said his policies would fuel hyperin
flation by printing more currency and 
restoring subsidies to Russias ineffi
cient state farms and industries to 
keep them running.
He said he wanted to move further 
and further down that road even 
though he faces a difficult year of 
social unrest and explosive prices.
Chernomyrdins remarks illustrated 
the ambivalence of many Russian of
ficeholders, who tend to promise re
form when addressing foreign audiences  but at home vow to soften 
reforms and their economic shocks.
Chernomyrdins critics also spoke, 
asking whether his government has 
the political will to make the harsh 
choices necessary to jettison unpro
ductive enterprises and integrate Rus
sia with the world economy.
They seem to think they can make 
the economy run on pure air, said 
Boris Fyodorov, a reformist who quit 
this month as finance minister after 
saying Chernomyrdin was ignoring 
his counsel.
Fyodorov said Russia soon could face 
the kind of economic catastrophe un
folding in Ukraine if Chernomyrdin 
pursues proposals to restore state sub
sidies.
We need to wait another month to 
see what will happen, he said. But I 
would say the odds are 75 percent that 
Chernomyrdin will go the wrong way.

Aged citizens find 
medicine costly
MIDDLETOWN, Conn., January 29 
(LAT-WP)  From his office in the rear 
of Peltons Pharmacy, one ofthe nations 
oldest drugstores, owner Gerard H. 
Weitzman has a clear view of the phar
maceutical industrys current pricing 
scheme. What he sees is a system that 
discriminates against his customers, 
particularly the elderly and the poor.
When Peltons Pharmacy purchases 
prescription medicine from drug manu
facturers, Weitzman pays a standard 
wholesale price. But when he buys the 
very same drugs in his role as purchas
ing agent for a nearby hospital, he can 
negotiate deep discounts.
The price differential can be gigantic. 
For an inhaler used to treat asthma 
patients, for example, Peltons pays 
$18.84 while the hospital pays only $1.55.
Its simply not fair, Weitzman said. 
His customers, he said, must pay higher 
prices for most of their prescriptions so 
that the pharmaceutical industry can 
afford to compete for high-volume busi
ness at hospitals, nursing homes, mail 
order houses, and health maintenance 
organizations.
Weitzmans lament, shared by most 
pharmacists around the country, re
cently has become the central issue in a 
series of lawsuits filed by drugstore 
chains against the pharmaceutical in
dustry. Moreover, it is certain to be a 
major point of contention in the coming 
congressional debate over President Bill 
Clintons proposal for health care re
form.
While customers at Peltons and other 
pharmacies across the country fre
quently complain about the high cost of 
prescription drugs, few realize that they 
are not all paying the same price. The 
highest prices are charged to those who 
have no insurance coverage for drugs, 
including most low-wage workers and 
the majority of elderly people on Medi
care.
Charles M. West, executive vice presi
dent of the National Association of Re
tail Druggists, contended that the higher 
pharmacy prices are causing alarming 
numbers of seniors and others to go 
without much-needed prescription medi
cation simply because they cannot af
ford it.
Nor are patients at hospitals and 
HMOs getting much  if any  advan
tage from lower wholesale prices. While 
pharmacies normally mark up drug 
prices about 30 percent, hospitals and 
HMOs routinely add at least 70 percent, 
and some hospitals have been known to 
charge Medicare or the insurance com
panies as much as two or three times the 
retail price paid by customers at a drug
store.
This system hurts community drug
gists almost as much as consumers. Al
though 90 percent of Americans get their 
prescriptions filled at drugstores, the 
retail druggists group estimates that 
pricing problems have forced about 1,000 
stores out of business in the last two 
years.
Net drugstore profits have fallen 32 
percent in the last two decades, accord
ing to a survey in the Lilly Digest, pub
lished by the Eli Lilly pharmaceutical 
company. Pharmacies now earn an esti
mated 50 cents on the average $26 pre
scription price, which West called barely 
enough to stay in business.
Record numbers leave Congress
PINEYPOINT, Md., January 29 (LATWP)  They work days so packed with 
appointments, their time is doled out in 
tiny dollops. They stand for reelection so 
often the campaign fund-raising and 
stumping back home never seems to 
end. They are members of Congress.
Instead of thanks from a grateful elec
torate, they are widely scorned by the 
press and the public as a collection of 
crooks, philanderers, andover-paid dolts.
Even at a private retreat for Demo
cratic House members, one of President 
Bill Clintons top advisers felt free to 
poke fun at them.
I believe strongly in both sides of that 
argument, Clinton economic aide Rob
ert Rubin said in response to a question 
during a panel discussion, whichis why 
I might run for Congress some time.
So, how many lawmakers would vol
unteer to leave all this glamour and 
power for private life? Plenty. They are 
breaking land speed records for the pace 
at which they are rushing out the door.
By the end of the week, a total of 33 
House members had announced their 
intention not to seek re-election  the 
largest number at this point in the reelection cycle in more than a decade, 
according to a study by the Capitol Hill 
newspaper, Roll Call.
Its not clear yet whether the tally will 
ultimately reach the record total of 65 
House members who chose to bow out in
1992. But the departures are already 
ahead of the pace set then, when 26 
lawmakers had announced their inten
tions to leave by January 23.
Given the influx of 110 freshmen last 
year and a smaller but still sizable turn
over in 1990, the loss of only 30 more 
incumbents  through resignation or 
defeat at the polls  would mean that 
more than half the representatives who 
take office next year will have served in 
the 435-member body no longer than 
four years.
They seem to be practicing voluntary 
term limits.
Its amazing, said Stuart Rothenbi 
a political analyst. The big turnovt" 
was no surprise in 1992 with reappot. 
tionment, the bank scandal, and the 
anti-incumbent mood. Im not really suts 
whats driving it this year.
Israel, PLO work for compromise
DAVOS, Switzerland, January 2) 
(LAT-WP)  The quest for an agree, 
ment on Palestinian autonomy brought 
Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Pera 
and Palestine Liberation Organizatim 
leader Yasser Arafat Saturday to ye 
another exotic locale for one more 1 
level attempt at compromise.
Aides to both men expressed douht 
that all the remaining obstacles wonli 
be overcome and an agreement signa 
this weekend. But each brought his chit 
negotiators and a complement of politi 
cal assistants in an attempt to break ths 
deadlock over implementation of Israeli 
promised withdrawal from the Gaa 
Strip and Jericho.
Close to midnight, after Arafat 
Peres had been meeting for nearly fon 
hours, Israeli Environment Ministei 
Yossi Sarid gave an upbeat assessmes 
of the first session. He described the 
atmosphere as excellent, much mon 
than expected, and predicted the two 
would meet late into the night and muc] 
of Sunday.
This time, the setting is on the srnra 
covered Alpine resort village of Davoi 
currently host to an annual conference 
drawing luminaries from the world 
international business and politics, 
joint appearance by Peres and Arafa 
Sunday is supposed to cap the Work 
Economic Forum schedule.
The pullout implementing the GazsJericho First plan, which was to 
followed by Israels transfer of admin 
trative and police authority to Palestin
ians in the remainder of the West Bank, 
is nearly two months overdue. The with
drawal was supposed to begin on De
cember 13 and be completed by April 13.
Mutual suspicion has replaced the 
euphoria that accompanied the Septem
ber signing of the accord in Washingtoi 
and Arafats handshake with prime min
ister YitzhakRabin. The transitions 
handshake to handoff foundered on the 
PLOs demand for concrete symbols tl 
its independence and Israels preoccu
pation with its security.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  31 January 19943
CMU, SEIU remain far apart in contract negotiations
UNION from page 1
going to give you the date, said 
Yoedt, adding that hes been try
ing his best to avoid a strike and 
the unions executive committee 
will make a final decision later 
this week.
He said one of the major flaws 
in the Universitys proposal is 
the increasingly greater amount 
it would require workers to pay 
for health care coverage$800 a 
year by 1996. The contract would 
require workers to pay 15 per
cent of their health care costs two 
years from now, with the school 
picking up the rest of the tab.
Under the Universitys pro
posal, the cost would increase to 
$18 in July 1994. In July 1995, it 
would double to $36. And in July 
1996, the University wants the 
employees to pay about $65 per 
month. That means the person 
couldnt afford health care. So 
the University saves the money 
theyd have to chip in, he said.
The administration responded 
by saying that they have been 
flexible in bargaining and have 
offered to give the union the ex
act same coverage other employ
ees received, but the members
rejected it.
The University has spent the 
last 14 months trying to get the 
union to agree to its proposals, 
and there are signs the workers 
opposition is weakening. Last 
weeks 6353 vote to reject the 
administrations contract was 
much closer than the first vote, 
which was held in January 1993 
and resulted in an overwhelming 
1333 vote to reject the Univer
sitys offer.
The growing number of union 
members willing to accept the 
Universitys proposals shows 
some progress is being made, said 
University Attorney Walter 
DeForest.
I think we are very close to 
something that is acceptable to 
the majority of the members, but 
we have not yet been able to de
velop a package that the mem
bership has accepted, said 
DeForest.
DeForest said if union mem
bers had understood exactly what 
they were voting for last week, 
the vote might have been differ
ent. Some members didnt know 
that a vote to reject the contract 
also authorized a strike, he said.
I think there was some confu
sion at the unions meeting and 
were hopeful that if the offer 
were fully understood, it would 
be acceptable to a majority of 
people, said DeForest.
The Universitys position was 
reflected in the letter sent to the 
union last week, which read in
"These people couldnt 
afford health care ... New 
people coming in are really 
getting screwed. 
 Union leader Jack Yoedt
part, We believe that, in fair
ness to our employees, they 
should have the opportunity to 
vote on the contract and sepa
rately vote on whether to strike. 
The membership should be able 
to vote now [with full knowledge 
of their actions]. How can anyone 
be hurt by giving them a chance 
to consider the matter without 
confusion?
According to union president
Yoedt, the administrations 
charge is unfounded and is de
signed to encourage dissention 
among union members, as well 
as confuse the issue. Everyone 
knew what they were voting on. 
That question was brought up 
and answered on the floor. No
body was confused ... The school
------------------- was convinced
we would accept 
their offer. Now 
theyre trying to 
do this and shove 
it down our 
throats, he said.
Yoedt says that 
Andrew Car
negie made his
------------------- fortune by employing thou
sands of immigrant workers in 
his steel mills and paying them 
subsistence wages, and the Uni
versity which bears his name is 
doing the same thing today.
About two-thirds of the dining 
services workers are minorities 
and a significant number are 
single mothers... I always thought 
that institutions like CMU were 
supposed to be leaders in the community. They should pay people
enough money so they dont have 
to survive on food stamps, said 
Yoedt.
He said that part of the prob
lem may rest with University 
President Robert Mehrabian. 
Mehrabian said there was a la
bor problem in the city. Its not 
true. Weve had [only one strike] 
in the last six years. Weve suc
cessfully negotiated 200 con
tracts, said Yoedt, who claimed 
that Pittsburgh labor relations 
professionals are clearly of
fended by Mehrabians com
ments and implied criticism of 
their work.
Even though Mehrabians com
ments, in a white paper on boost
ing Pittsburghs economic devel
opment, referred to a nationwide 
perception of labor problems in 
Pittsburgh that must be over
come, the University president 
himself may have to overcome a 
perception that he is hostile to 
labor unions.
According to a source on the 
faculty who wished to remain 
anonymous, one of the main rea
sons an agreement hasnt been 
reached is Mehrabians personal 
animosity towards the union.
DeForest, legal counsel for the 
University, said the quotation 
about labor problems was taken 
out of context and the comment 
was not made about Local 29.n 
He said Mehrabian was address
ing the fact that many businesses 
who consider Pittsburgh as at 
place to locate have a very nega-; 
tive perception of the labor cli-; 
mate in this city.
Susan Kinchelow, assistant 
H&SS dean, said she can see botty 
sides of the issue. For some rea-j 
son, the two groups are realty 
opposed to each other. Its almost 
as if no matter what happens; 
theyll never have a very goocj 
view of each other... Itll be diffi-f 
cult if theres a picket line and 
people are going to have to cros 
it, said Kinchelow.
Campus Police Chief James 
LaPaglia says that if there is 4 
picket line, he expects the unioii 
will obey the law as it has in the 
past.
I would like to take a very low! 
key approach  [the workers} 
are members of the campus comr 
munity. Well maintain order but 
wed like to do it in a non-confronr 
tational manner, he said.
Motion to change IVCF status fails
IVCF, from page 1
way around the rules.
Now Senate has no option but to allow discrimi
nation, [and] allow groups to select membership, 
said Altmann. He also pointed out that IVCF had 
another option. According to Altmann, they could 
have broken from the national IVCF organization 
which requires the statement.
Mendenhall said that the statement does not 
present a problem. Only six people have to sign 
the statement. Membership is open to anyone, she 
said.
The next step IVCF faces is their request for 
space in the Naval Reserve Building. Mendenhall 
thought that the Senate debate had not hurt IVCFs 
chances of getting an office.
Altmann said, The [Space Allocation] Board 
couldnt come to a consensus.... [The decision] will 
depend on which direction [Dean of Student Af
fairs] Michael Murphy thinks has the least unde
sirable consequences.
Murphy has the final decision about how space in 
the Naval Building is allocated.
Brian Bailey, former president of IVCF, said, I 
believe we have the merits [to get space].
Senate could change its mind. Senators who 
voted for IVCF to keep its recognition could move 
to reconsider the decision. This could bring the 
issue up for another vote.
Altmann said, [Some] people who voted to keep 
recognition are wavering and it might [be reconsid
ered].

going through the process. Since these groups 
have the most need for offices they will be granted 
them immediately.
The size of some of the offices is about 250-300 
square feet. Because space in the new building is 
limited, some organizations will share an office. 
According to Murphy, that shouldnt be a prob
lem since the larger offices will be split with 
dividers. He said that when it comes to putting 
together booths and buggies, those activities will
be done at a place other than the offices.
The recommendation should be in Murphys 
hands by weeks end. At that point he can ap
prove it, change it, or reject it. That will take 
about a week. According to Brian Bailey, a 
member of the board and a senior physics major, 
the organizations can move in, as soon as reno
vations are completed.
It is anticipated that moving will commence 
around Spring Break and conclude around Spring 
Carnival. Some organizations may not move 
until the last week of school. For those groups 
that have heavy equipment to transport, movers 
will be hired to assist them.
Crime and Incident Report
1/7 THEFT, 3:58 pm. Campus Police

a CMU staffer was approached by two 
men in a blue Chevrolet mini-van, who

dates can do any advertising they want 
as long as its at least 30 feet away from 
the table.
Also, theyre not allowed to paint the 
fence for elections, said Albert.
Tim Mallo, president of the Graduate 
Student Organization (GSO), said that 
the extent of GSOs involvement with 
Senates elections is an announcement 
at this Wednesdays meeting.
GSO will have nothing to do with 
Senates elections, said Mallo. How
ever, if a graduate student comes to the 
meeting and asks for GSOs endorse
ment or assistance, GSO will consider 
it.
Im not saying that no graduate stu
dents are running, Mallo said. There 
will be no official backing of any plat
form. No funds will be used to make 
copies of a candidate list like last semes
ter, said Mallo.
Bridgette Landers, a sophomore math
ematics/computer science major, ran as 
a write-in candidate in Novembers elec
tion. This time, she submitted a peti
tion.
I think its really sad what happened, 
said Landers. A lot of undergraduates 
got bent out of shape because they 
thought the graduate students were tak
ing over. We should all try to work
together.
Landers said that she decided to run 
for Student Senate because she wanted 
to get some action out of the student 
body.
Its a good thing for people to get 
opinions and act upon them, said 
Landers. When something important 
happens, we should have people know 
about it... and try to make judgments 
with their best interests in mind.

Union, University must 
reach common ground
The Service Emplyees inter
national Union (SEIU) local 29 
represents the employees of Din
ing Services, Physical Plant, and 
American Building Mainte
nance (ABM) at CMU. For the 
past 14 months these employ
ees have been working without 
a contract because the ISWU 
and the university have been 
unable to reach an agreement 
over the terms of a contract. 
Working without a contract 
means these employees are sub
ject to the whim of their em
ployer, CMU.
Without a contract, changes 
can be made in the workers 
situation without their prior 
knowledge or approval. This 
might mean being fired at any 
time or having pay rates 
changed. As it stands at this 
time, the service workers are 
being paid the rate the old con
tract specified. A union is sup
posed to work for the employ
ees best interests, which means 
negotiating the best contract 
possible for their members 
through collective bargaining 
with the employer. But in this 
case, the union and the univer
sity have found it impossible to 
come to terms in the past 14 
months.
Should the workers strike? 
That is usually the next step 
employees take when they con
sider themselves to be in an 
unfair work situation. Consider, 
though, that a strike in this case 
may not be the most effective 
solution. A strike by the service 
workers would inconvenience 
the students and other employ
ees of CMU. Without Dining
Last weeks call by some stu
dent Senators to revoke recog
nition of the Inter-Varsity Chris
tian Fellowship is another ex
ample of the ineffectiveness of 
the Senate. This petty bicker
ing offers no benefit to the Sena
tors constituents and is simply 
another waste of time  a 
phrase becoming all too popular 
regarding Senate issues.
Senate deals with many im
portant issues affecting the stu
dent body, but never seems to 
get anything accomplished. Is
sues like improving school spirit, 
or the sewage problems near 
Donner Hall and Resnik House, 
get sent off to a nebulous Com
mittee Land, where they are 
always worked on but are 
rarely completed.
Further more, the Senate has 
surprisingly little power for an 
organization which controls over 
half a million dollars. Money is 
the primary reason that anyone 
cares at all about Senate. Every 
organization wants its share of 
the activities fee pie, and after 
Senate doles it all out, things 
return to normal  which is to 
say no one hears anything from 
Senate, and no one cares.
However, the student body it
self is not entirely without 
blame. No one seems willing to 
get involved, and in the recent 
election preparation only 10 
people turned in petitions for 
over 29 open seats. Further, elecServices, Physical Plant, or 
ABM, there would be no food, no 
clean up, and no repairs being 
made. If the service workers 
were to strike, they would not 
be bringing home any money, 
and that would certainly be more 
than an inconvenience.
While it is certainly true that 
the administration was being 
unreasonable with its take it or 
leave it offers at the start of 
contract negotiations, it is also 
true that the administration has 
offered a reasonable contract. 
The health care package being 
offered is the same package 
which is offered to other em
ployees ofthe University. Health 
care is a major concern to eveiyone and if you want it, you have 
to pay for it. The union is being 
unreasonable in its demands for 
less expensive health care cov
erage.
Both parties involved in the 
negotiations have been unfair 
and unreasonable at some point 
in the proceedings. Now, how
ever, both the union and the 
university are fairly close to rec
onciling. Maybe the end to the 
battle is near. It is in the service 
workers best interest to work 
under a contract. The univer
sity seems to be coming around 
to a more reasonable position. 
Hopefully, a strike will not hap
pen when a conclusion could be 
so easily achieved. There are 
bad feelings on both sides of the 
bargaining table in this situa
tion. It is in everyones best in
terest that a compromise be
tween the union and the univer
sity be reached soon, and with
out a strike, if at all possible.
tion turnout is always sparse: if 
20 percent of the student body 
votes, people are pleasantly sur
prised. While recent issues in
cluded graduate students com
plaints about lack of represen
tation, the student body as a 
whole is not being fairly repre
sented.
In fact, while Senate has 
power, it does not have nearly 
enough, and that, too, contrib
utes to the overall problem. Sen
ate can make all the recommen
dations it wants to the adminis
tration, but it simply lacks the 
power to accomplish anything. 
When Senate does pull together 
on an issue, they can influence 
the administration and get 
things accomplished. But far too 
often, it spends time bickering 
and arguing.
Perhaps a restructuring of stu
dent government is in order. 
This is an issue that was brought 
up last semester, and was sent 
through committee, where of 
course, there was a lot of talk 
and no action. While many indi
vidual Senators are passionate 
and enthusiastic, as a body, they 
are simply ineffectual. Perhaps 
getting the faculty or adminis
tration involved in government, 
as is the case at some other 
universities, would help give 
Senate the power it needs to 
gain the respect of the student 
body and work towards repre
senting it fairly.
Right to bear arms is sacred
Editor:
I would like to re
spond to the letter by 
Robert Huss [Gun 
control laws stop 
crime, 1/24]. I be
lieve that Huss is 
well- intentioned, but not well-informed, 
nor understanding of the complexity of 
the issue.
He belittles David Hunts reference to 
surveys documenting 645,000 crimes 
prevented a year by guns used by legal 
gun owners. If Huss would care to inves
tigate the literature relevant to this topic, 
he would find that the study which Hunt 
used was the most conservative, with 
some surveys reporting that up to 2.5 
million crimes a year are prevented. 
Keep in mind that the number of gun 
crimes in a year is about 500,000, so 
even the most conservative estimate of 
crime prevention still exceeds the un
lawful uses of guns.
He questions how effective these gun 
owners are, while Seth Eliot set this 
argument to rest in his own letter 
[Armed citizenry is a safeguard, 1/24]. 
He pointed out that private gun owners 
shoot the wrong person two percent of 
the time, while police make this error 11 
percent of the time.
Huss worries about shooting an un
armed burglar. Well, I dont think Im 
likely to be confident that anyone who 
breaks into an occupied house is not 
going to be dangerous. A rational bur
glar observes a residence and breaks in 
when it is empty. The only safe recourse 
if someone breaks into your house when
youre at home is to assume they are 
dangerous.
I dont wish to impugn the police, but 
their ability to respond to every crime is 
strained at present, and if you wish your 
life to count on their response time, that 
is your choice. I dont believe that my life 
should be subject to such a gamble, and 
I dont believe you have any right to 
make that choice for me.
I met an older man at my gun club this 
weekend. He was practicing with a pis
tol, and the first thing he mentioned was 
that he didnt do this for sport. He lives 
on the North Side. The man is a World 
War H veteran who served his country 
when it called on him, and now he feels 
a need to be able to protect himself. 
Could anyone be so crass as to be willing 
to take away his right to self-protection?
Huss alleges how much better the coun
try would be if we got rid of all guns. 
Well, I suppose that getting rid of all 
illegal guns would be nice, but how could 
one accomplish this?
Huss believes that this would start 
with removal of all legally owned guns, 
though I still wonder how this would be 
done. House-to-house searches? Confis
cation of property? Call in the military 
to control the populace?
Didnt we fight a revolution about this 
200 years ago? Didnt we write a Consti
tution including a Bill of Rights to in
sure that the government we created 
couldnt do such things?
The Second Amendment to the Con
stitution was deliberately included to 
protect the citizens right to keep and 
bear arms, for self-defense from unlaw
ful acts of both other people and of the 
government. This is a fundamental right, 
found both in the U.S. Constitution as 
well as most state constitutions, and as
such should not be infringed upon.

Guns benefit ordinary citizens
Editor:
Robert Husss as
sertion that banning 
guns will stop the gun 
violence problem is 
wrong [Gun control 
laws stop crime, 1/24]. No gun control 
law can be proven to have lowered the 
gun violence rate. Indeed, this century's 
history suggests that the violence will 
escalate if guns are criminalized.
Prohibition saw alcohol criminalized. 
Prices rose greatly, and gangs fought 
turf wars over the high profits. When it 
was repealed, violence fell.
The recent war on drugs has seen 
much violence due to the extreme profit 
levels. The availability of drugs has not 
been affected in any significant way.
Twice in this century we have seen 
items that people desire criminalized 
with no real effect on the availability, 
yet Huss believes that banning guns 
will be different.
Banning guns will do only two things. 
It will give criminals another high-profit 
commodity to fight over, and it will re
move the common citizens best deter
rent against criminal activity.

People often deal with trag
edies by putting them out of their 
minds. Survivors of the Holo

behind them in order to function 
in society. Many Vietnam vets 
refuse to discuss the horrors they 
experienced in the war. Simi
larly, many beaten or molested 
children supress their feelings 
to the point where they dont 
even remember what happened 
to them.
Is this what the world has 
done with nuclear weapons? It 
seems that no one recalls that 
the wonders of technology have 
provided us with the means to 
destroy the earths population 
in a matter of minutes.
Years ago, protest of nuclear 
weapons was commonplace. 
Films displayed the potential 
horrors of nuclear war, people 
complained about living in con
stant fear, and the government 
made efforts to reduce the num
ber of nuclear weapons in exist
ence.
So what? The government 
could wipe out 90 percent of its 
nuclear arsenal and there would
still be enough left over to 
kill us all twice.

Clinton ideology suffers identity crisis
Ronak Singhal
During the presidential campaign of 
1992, Bill Clinton attempted to disabuse 
the American people of the notion that he 
was just another tax-and-spend liberal 
Democrat. Instead, he wanted them to 
perceive him as a new breed of Democrat. 
Clinton was successful in defining himself 
in this mold, and thus was able to capture 
the most prized political seat in the world. 
Yet as Clinton concludes his first year, his 
own summation of the past year and his 
goals for the coming one leave questions 
about who he actually is.
Last Tuesday the President appeared 
before Congress and the rest of the nation 
to deliver his State of the Union Address, 
which served as the link between the first 
and second years of his presidency. Look
ing back on his first year in office, he 
extolled the virtues of NAFTA and GATT, 
the pair of free trade treaties that were put 
into place during 1993. In the past, free 
trade has not been a symbol of the Demo
cratic Party, particularly because of that 
partys close ties to powerful domestic la
bor unions. Clinton, however, turned away 
from the standard and helped the cause of 
free trade.
But not all the moves that Clinton made 
in 1992 suggest that he has turned his
back on traditional liberal ideology. He 
still practiced the politics of class envy 
last Tuesday by lauding Congress for 
raising taxes only on the rich. He failed 
to mention, however, the regressive gaso
line tax that hits poorer Americans 
harder. And although he vowed to cut 
the budget deficit in half within five 
years, new projections show that after
But then Clinton also said that re
sponsibility lies with the family, that 
people should join churches, and that 
the breakdown of the family unit must 
end. These notions seem to lie within the 
scope of what former Vice President Dan 
Quayle said. Quayle was ridiculed by 
Clinton and his followers for being out of 
step with America, but now Clinton apClinton ran the gamut in his speech, from 
emulating Lyndon Johnson to reiterating Dan 
Quayle.
probably falling for the next four years, 
the deficit will return to its current posi
tion. All in all, Clintons first year sent a 
mixed signal as to who he really is.
More importantly, though, is who 
Clinton will attempt to be during this 
upcoming year. Clinton defined his 
agenda in his address to Congress, but 
again failed to clearly reveal his own 
ideology.
On the one hand, the President seemed 
to indicate that the role of the govern
ment was to give people the opportu
nity to achieve the American Dream. 
This is a liberal idea, as compared to the 
typical conservative mantra that people 
must earn their opportunity to achieve 
that dream.
pears to be agreeing with him. Obvi
ously, these two ideas are not wholly 
incompatible because the government 
does need to help people in certain cases; 
however, they do serve to show the di
chotomy of views that Clinton has 
adopted.
In this same vein, Clinton showed 
both sides of himself when plotting out 
his course to reform both health care 
and welfare this year. The welfare re
form that Clinton has championed has 
been something for which Republicans 
have been crying for years, but in the 
past, their efforts have been stymied by 
liberal Democrats.
Now, though, a Democratic President 
has challenged Congress to change our
welfare system so that it [welfare] does not 
become a way of life.
On the other hand, Clinton still appears to 
want to replace the current free market 
health care system with one that could end 
up resembling anything from the bureau
cratic nightmare of a Canadian-style single
payer system, to a Western European-styled 
form of socialized medicine. Either way, the 
President seems to want to replace the eco
nomic system upon which this country was 
founded and on which it has succeeded.
The health care system does need some 
reform, especially in the area of liability 
faced by doctors, but as Senator Robert Dole 
said, it does not need a triple heart bypass. 
This image that Clinton has of a government 
managed health care system harkens memo
ries of many of the Great Society programs 
of Lyndon Johnson, a man with whom tradi
tional liberals can easily identify.
Thus, Clinton ran the gamut in his speech 
on Tuesday, from emulating Lyndon Johnson 
to reiterating Quayle. These statements show 
that Clinton is still trying to define himself 
in the eye of the American people as a New 
Democrat, but he still appears as one with 
many of the same values as the Old Guard. 
It remains to be seen whether Clinton will 
continue his edging away from traditional 
liberalism, or show that all his talk of a 
transformation is, to quote Shakespeare, 
nothing but words, words, words.

Recently, Congress cut off fund
ing for the construction of the 
superconducting supercollider in 
Texas. The bill of goods scientists 
had sold to a number of people 
regarding the benefits of spend
ing tens of billions of dollars to 
smash sub-atomic particles to
gether was striking. The day the 
project was halted, one of the 
people interviewed said,
My mother has cancer, 
and I was hoping that this 
project would lead to a 
cure. This was not some

the nearest doctor as our savior. 
If there is a problem that no one 
can solve at the moment, we can 
rest assured that doctors are on 
the doorstep of the next miracle, 
as long as we tithe sufficiently. 
Surely, if our checkbooks pray 
hard enough, we will soon have a

I look outside my bedroom 
window and see a battered 
courtyard. The pavement is 
cracked and the steps leading 
to the courtyard are destroyed, 
as though theyve been hit by a 
bomb. Venturing out into the 
cold January air, I have to 
watch my step as I walk down 
the crumbled stairs that lead 
to the street. I hold my breath 
as I walk past the first build
ing that I encounter in order to 
spare myself from the stench 
coming out of its exhaust vent. 
Trudging on towards a large 
. pit resembling a penitentiary, 
I turn left and approach a build
ing that has been under con
struction for as long as I have 
been here.
Is this an excerpt from some 
bizarre, Orwellian novel? No, 
its Carnegie Mellon Univer
sity today. The scenes de
scribed are, respectively, the 
Margaret Morrison Courtyard, 
the steps leading down from 
the Margaret Morrison Apart
ments, Resnik House, the ten
nis courts, and the Fine Arts 
Building.
The Margaret Morrison area 
is a shambles. Ive already de
scribed the exterior; the inte
rior is even worse. The plumb
ing is bad, the ceilings and
roofs are in poor condition, and 
the stoves and ovens dont al
ways work. (This year Hous
ing has addressed the prob
lems that my roommates and I 
have had in our apartment, 
but these are problems that we 
have been asking them to ad
dress for the past three years.)
Resnik has an odd odor about 
it, and you know exactly what 
Im talking about. Plus, it looks 
as though its made of plastic. 
When my younger sister came 
to visit me once at school, she 
pointed at the new dorms and 
said, Look, its like a Barbie 
house.
The tennis courts look like a 
prison, a large pit illuminated 
with floodlights. The Fine Arts 
Building has been under con
struction since 1990, the year 
before I came here. So all I can 
associate with the building is 
dust, rubble, and metal beams.
These are just a few of the 
eyesores that constitute our 
campus. Its rather depressing 
that a school acclaimed for its 
engineering and architecture 
departments has such a revolt
ing campus. Yes, thats right, 
revolting. I cant think of a 
single beautiful, nice, or even 
half-decent edifice on campus.  
(Dont argue that the Mellon 
Institute is an example of fine 
architecture. Its the most fas
cist-looking building Ive ever 
seen in my entire life.) Why not 
face the truth? This campus

Lorena Bobbitt evaded justice with impulse plea
Jason Heinlein
The recent court decision in the Lorena 
Bobbitt case has made me shudder at 
the thought of what our legal system has 
become. How is it possible that someone 
can be charged with a crime, admit to 
being guilty, and still serve no jail sen
tence? Furthermore, how is it possible 
that a court agreed that a case of re
venge was justified? It is because the 
lawyers turned the case away from the 
question of whether or not Lorena did it 
to the question of whether or not John 
Wayne Bobbitt was a low-life individual. 
But no matter what he did, there was no 
justification for her malicious attack.
Although John Bobbitt was cleared of 
any wrongdoing in an August 1993 trial, 
lets assume just for the sake of argu
ment that he was guilty of sexual as
sault and marital abuse. Lorena Bobbitt 
testified that almost immediately after 
they were married in 1989, he began to 
beat, torture, and rape her.
What possible inspiration could she 
have for staying with him? This is not 
the Middle Ages; women who leave their
husbands are not shunned by society. 
Therefore, although she may have felt 
threatened by John Bobbit, it was still 
her choice to stay with him. Already she 
failed to act in the first logical way to end 
such abuse. The next rational step to 
ending such an abusive situation would 
be to have him arrested. This is not a 
difficult task, and many people have 
been arrested for smaller crimes. After 
his arrest, if he was found guilty by a 
jury of his peers, I would totally agree 
with locking him up until he is too old to 
remember his name. But she did not do 
this.
If the situation was one which re
quired force, she could morally and le
gally use mace or some other weapon to 
stop his attack, and then call the police. 
But she did not do this. If she was indeed 
in mortal danger and felt that her life 
was threatened, which she might have, 
she would have been justified in shoot
ing and killing him in order to stop the 
assault. But once again, she did not do 
this.
What she did do was creep into the 
room while he slept and take revenge on 
him in the worst way that she could 
imagine. She did not defend herself or 
end an attack; she took pure, cold, vio
lent revenge after any danger had passed.
And now, the court says that that is just 
fine.
What I dont understand is why ex
tremist womens groups, such as those 
who protested outside the U.S. Consu
late in Guayaquil, Ecuador, said that
did, once he was asleep in bed, she was 
no longer defending herself.
Another thing I dont understand is 
that if she was charged with malicious 
wounding, and admitted that she did it, 
why was she not found guilty? They say
No matter what John Bobbitt did, once he 
was asleep in bed, Lorena Bobbitt was no 
longer defending herself.
her actions were the last recourse that 
a woman has to defend herself from a 
desperate situation. How was this her 
last recourse? Did she act in any of the 
other ways that a civilized human would 
to end the abuse? Did she even try? The 
answer is a resounding no.
Even in cases of self-defense when 
people are threatened with deadly force, 
they are not legally permitted to go home, 
grab their favorite firearm, and return 
to kill the assailant. The act of defense 
must be within the same sequence of 
events and not after the danger has 
passed. If you wait, then it is no longer 
defense; it is murder. No matter what he

that it had been suggested that 
he give all his possessions to 
the poor and live on the streets. 
When his consumption of ba
con, eggs, chicken, and ham
burgers brings about the last 
coronary (as it will, as surely as 
if he were ingesting arsenic), it 
will be a tragedy we are all 
expected to mourn.
Of course, we college students 
are immortal. Perhaps the old
people have to change their di
ets, eat a bit more chicken (de
spite the fact that chicken has 
four times more saturated fat 
per calorie than the flesh of pig 
and cows). But that is only in 
the future. We can always re
pent later, and hey, the medi
cine men will always save us, 
right? Say your prayers.

looks as though it was designed 
by Mike Brady and Albert Speer.
Not only is our campus ugly, 
but its also something of a lemon 
 nothing works. Planning was 
a procedure left out of the system 
when these buildings were 
erected. Skibo is the best example 
of the ugly/deficient combination: 
the building looks like an air
plane hangar, and doesnt meet 
the needs of the student popula
tion. The excuse Ive heard for 
Skibo is, Well, theyre tearing it 
down. Why didnt they build an 
adequate student center in the
first place?
I dont understand why this 
school has such an unsightly cam
pus; there is no reason for it to 
look the way it does. We pay too 
much money to have to put up 
with this. With any luck, the new 
student center will be a quality 
building.
Unfortunately, in light of the 
past record, that doesnt seem 
likely.

mental institution until she is old and 
gray. If they find that she is all right 
after the 45 days, then she should be 
lockedup. I say this because John Bobbitt 
will always feel the effects of her attack, 
and he will never again be all right. It 
doesnt matter to him that she is all 
better now, for he will be scarred for the 
rest of his life.
Lorenas defense attorney, Blair 
Howard, said, This is a giant step for
ward for Lorena in the healing process; 
I sympathize with her if she was abused, 
but I have no pity on her for the punish
ment that she should receive for taking 
revenge on John Bobbitt. Regardless of 
what happened in the past, each of us is 
responsible for his or her own actions, 
and we must assure that those actions 
are appropriate for the situation. Her 
actions were not, and therefore she 
should be punished.
Contrary to how it may seem, I am not 
taking his side in the matter. In fact, if 
John Bobbitt had been found guilty 
rape and abuse in a court of law, then he 
should have been in the cell right next to 
hers because neither of them should be 
allowed to go free.

Mens basketball shocks Washington
By JOHN WEBER
Tartan Staffwriter 
ERIC STRAUSS
Tartan Sports Editor
The Carnegie Mellon mens 
basketball team tried to turn its 
season around on Sunday after rallying from 17 points
down for a thrilling 82-80 over
time win over Washington Uni
versity of St. Louis.
Trailing 45-28 at the half, the 
Tartans rallied to tie the game at 
72 and send it into overtime, 
where they put up a slim 10-8 
edge for the win.
The team improved to 611 and
evened its UAA record at 4-4 
with the win.
The biggest individual high
light was senior guard Mike Hosni 
reaching 1,000 career points. 
Hosni, who led all CMU scorers 
with 22 points, now has 1,013 
career points, making him the 
14th player in CMU history to hit

that mark. He joins senior Derek 
Dragisich as the second player to 
achieve the milestone this sea
son.
Dragisich and sophomore Kevin 
Byrne each chipped in 13 points 
to help lead the Tartans to vic
tory. Other leading scorers in
cluded freshman Rich Bodnar, 
who posted 11 points, and senior 
Charlie Connors had nine points.
Byrne had nine rebounds and 
Dragisich had eight to lead the 
Tartans.
Kevin Folkl led Washington 
with a game-high 25 points, and 
also pulled down 11 boards. Gene 
Nolan added 15, and Jeff Hutz 
had 13.
Before the Washington game, 
things just couldnt get much 
worse. After a tough loss to New 
York University last week, the 
Tartans were hoping to get things 
back on track. However, things 
did not turn out as they planned.
First, last Wednesday night the 
Tartans lost to Washington & 
Jefferson College. The Tartans 
never had much of a lead and 
trailed 44-29 at halffcime. In the 
first half the Tartans shot 41.4 
percent from the field, while W&J 
shot 53.6 percent.
Unlike the last couple of games, 
there was no comeback in the 
second half. The Tartans contin
ued to struggle right up to the 
final buzzer. The final score was 
Washington & Jefferson 93, CMU 
70. Washington & Jefferson were 
led by three scorers: Terry Wil
kins (25 points), Kenyon Bonner 
(21 points), and Mark Johnson
(17 points). The Tartans were led 
by Connors who had 13 points 
and five rebounds. Also, Bodnar 
scored 10 points (with five re
bounds), sophomore Gregg 
Lassan had nine points, and 
Byrne had four points and seven

no wins in the UAA. The first half1 
was not very basketball-like, as *' 
both teams combined for only 38 1

The only good news for the Tar

was not a UAA Conference game.

Womens team loses pair of league games
By ANUJ GUPTA
Tartan Assistant Sports Editor
This past weekend the CMU 
womens basketball team contin
ued to trudge through their busy 
UAA schedule on the road, with 
games against the University of 
Chicago Friday night, and Wash
ington University in St. Louis, 
Sunday afternoon.
Friday nights game dropped 
the Tartans record to 8-8 overall 
(2-5 in the UAA) as they fell to 
host Chicago, 55-39.
Chicago clearly dominated 
throughout the game as they led 
by nine points at the half and 
outscored the Tartans 25-18 in 
the second period.
Chicago shot a .447 field goal 
percentage for the game with a 
red hot .526 mark for the second 
period. The Tartans meanwhile 
held a 28.6 field goal percentage 
for the game but shot better in 
the first period than the second 
with 31 percent versus 25.9 per
cent in the second period.
The leading scorer for the Tar
tans was senior forward Jeanine 
Megahan who continued her 
quest for second place on the all 
time CMU scoring list with four
teen points. Megahan was fol
lowed by freshman forward 
Kristen Kupfer and junior guard 
Jenny Gretz who both had eight 
points apiece, and freshman 
Daphne Harris who had four of 
her own.
The leading rebounder for the 
Tartans was Kupfer, who had 
eight total (including five on the 
offensive end), and Megahan led

in the assist category with two.
Although they were outscored, 
the Tartans dominated in the take 
away category as they had 13 
steals versus the seven of Chi
cago. Gretz led the Tartans with 
a total of four steals and was 
followed by Kupfer, Megahan, 
senior center Mary Moore and 
junior Christa Sober who all had 
two apiece. Moore also high
lighted the Tartans defense with 
two blocked shots.
As for the home team, they were 
led in scoring by guard Kim Den
nis who had 14 points, and was 
followed by forwards Heather 
Gammel (13 points) and Kelly 
Humphry (11 points).
Both teams were about the 
same from the three point range 
as the Tartans were a combined 
one for 10 from the three point 
line and Chicago was one for 
seven.
The win improved Chicagos 
record to 10-6 overall and 4^3 in 
the UAA.
The Tartans continued their 
road trip by losing in a blowout 
to Washington University, 76 
47. The game belonged to Wash
ington from the start as they led 
35-20 at the half and then blew 
the game wide open in the sec
ond period by outscoring the 
Tartans by 14 points.
Although the Tartans suffered 
the defeat, the game was 
achievement in a sense that it 
was highlighted by Megahans

Indoor track opens season against tough competition
By CAROLYN SKARABA
I *frtaii Assistant Sports Editor
Melissa Baustert, a sophomore 
j?ember the indoor track and 
pld team, set a new school record 
i uj the 800-meter run with a win/ Tg time of 2:22.80 at the Rob^orris College Invitational two weeks ago.
{On January 22, the womens 
also competed at Robert 
^ .orris. There were five division I
 ainsPresent so the competition was stiff.
Overall we looked a little rusty 
because of the weather and not 
being able to practice, coach 
Dario Donatelli said. The divi
sion I schools also had the advan
tage of having started their sea
son in December. A first place 
winner from CMU was Ersula 
Cosby who managed a 31 r7" triple 
jump height.
The mens team also had a suc
cessful start at the Robert Morris 
meet. In first place for the 35- 
pound weight throw was sopho
more E.. J, Tsangaris. Freshman
Josh Greynolds had a time of 9:08 
for the 3,000 meters, about which 
coach Gary Meckley said, I con
sidered his an exceptional perfor
mance for a freshmen.
The sprinters are looking very 
strong so far and are expected to 
be CMUs strength for UAA cham
pionships. Sophomore Jim Filicko 
ran the 55 meter in 6:64 to finish 
first, followed closely by senior 
Jarrod Siket. Grad student Brad 
Shapiro came in second place in 
the 800 meters with a time of 
2:00.8. For the long and triple
jumps, freshman Doug Harrell 
did extremely well. And lastly, 
the hurdlers are looking very good 
this early on in the season.
Meckley is very encouraged by 
the level of competition consider
ing the lack of practice because of 
poor weather conditions.
This past weekend, the mens 
and womens teams traveled to 
Slippery Rock. Other teams en
tered in the meet were primarily 
Division II schools, so CMU was 
able to be more competitive than 
last week.
For the womens team Cosby 
finished in first place in the triple 
jump event. Baustert and senior 
Aliza Hildebrand both contrib
uted second place wins in the 400 
meter run and the 1500 meter 
run respectively. This was the 
first race of the year for 
Hildebrand.
Third place for CMU womens 
team was the 4x400 meter relay 
team consisting of Baustert, 
freshman Seratu Mohammad, 
sophomore Stephanie Stine, and 
Hildebrand.
ond place spot with 1,346 points. 
Lightner played for the Tartans 
from 1985-89.
Please see WOMEN, page 11
Between weather and injuries 
weve been having a slow start. 
Im looking forward to getting 
the whole team back together, 
coach Donatelli remarked.
Sprinters did not compete in 
this meet due to Slippery Rocks 
hard track, and possibility of in
jury. On Saturday February 5 
they run again at Slippery Rock. 
Next week Donatelli plans on 
taking a few athletes down to

Top 10 reasons hockey lacks coverage
The Puck Stops Here
by Allan Bourdius
Its no big secret that professional hockey is the 
least popular sport among the major professional 
leagues. Even pro golf  easily the most boring 
sport to watch  gets more exposure in the press 
and on the air than hockey does. Its a real shame.
The NHL Board of Governors hired league com
missioner Gary Bettman away from the NBA with 
'the goal of increasing hockeys exposure.
Bettman has done relatively well so far, but the 
NHL is still without a national television contract. 
NBC televised last weeks All-Star Game and ABC 
is going to be showing a few games during the 
Stanley Cup Playoffs. Its a start, but not enough to 
Wild the fan support that hockey would like to 
Jiave. The NHL needs to do a better job marketing 
itself if it expects to be a bigger business and 
increase the popularity of the sport. So then, here
are my top 10 ways to improve hockeys popularity.
1) Make CBS an offer they cant refuse. The
NHL is in every major U.S. television market, yet 
doesnt have nationwide coverage. Now that CBS 
isnt showing the NFL for the first time in 28 years, 
theyve got no perennial sports commitment be
sides Major League Baseball. Why not pick up the 
NHL? While viewership wont be great at first, 
hockey could be a great money maker for CBS a few 
years down the road. CBS could run a similar 
system to an NFL broadcast; a studio preview show 
and two featured games back-to-back. They could 
show regional action, and pressure some of its 
affiliates into showing local games when the net
work as a whole isnt carrying hockey.
2) Market the players. Most non-hockey fans 
could probably name Wayne Gretzky, Mario 
Lemieux, and thats about it. I really dont follow 
pro basketball, yet I can name at least 30 NBA 
players off the top of my head and probably 15 or 20 
more if I thought about it. Even the bad basketball, 
football, and baseball pros get more press than the 
truly outstanding athletes in the NHL. Get some of 
these guys better endorsement contracts. Right 
now, the only player who does national endorse
ments in the U.S. is Gretzky. Hes currently on 
Dominos Pizza commercials, but nine out of 10 
Americans probably dont even realize thats who it
is. An aerobics instructor seems to have a better 
chance of getting a Nike contract than Steve 
Yzerman, Ray Bourque, or John Vanbiesbrouck. 
Thats just pathetic.
3) Let the NHL players play in the Olym
pics. Would it really hurt the NHL to take a three 
week break every four years to send a Dream Team 
like the NBA to represent Canada and the USA in 
the Olympics? Theyd have to start the season 
earlier, but thats all. Actually, putting a week or 
two for a break (besides the one for the All-Star 
Game) in every season will improve the game 
because it will allow players to rest and be healthy 
for the end-season playoff run. Off weeks certainly 
havent hurt the NFL. Just imagine the hype that 
would surround a USA vs. Canada Gold Medal 
Game (since thats what would probably happen) 
with NHL players involved.
4) Keep expanding. Minnesota deserves to 
have a team, and so does Seattle. Theres easily the 
talent base to support 28 teams, especially with the 
influx of European players in recent years. This 
past years expansion produced two passable teams, 
one of which could very well make the playoffs. 
Parity in expansion is the key, and the NHL seems 
to have found the formula.
5) End the senseless violence. With all the 
outcry over violence in the media and its effect on
children, hockey fights arent conducive to paren
tal approval for viewing. The NHL is the only PG13 sports league in the world. As much as I myself 
enjoy watching an occasional hockey fight, there 
no place for them anymore. This isnt to say that 
hockey will cease to be a physical game. Football 
manages to deal out contact punishment without 
fights breaking out as often as they do between 
their NHL counterparts. The rule for fighting in 
hockey should be the same as in baseball, basket
ball, or football: if you raise your fists, youre 
heading for the showers.
6) Market the game. Hockey is different from 
any other sport in that it involves two major skills 
utilized at the same time: skating and stick han
dling. Probably 90 percent of Americans know that 
the Heisman Trophy goes to the top player in 
college football every year but how many people 
know that the Hobey Baker Award goes to the top 
player in college hockey? How many people could 
even name a Hobey Baker winner? (Pittsburgh 
Kevin Stevens was one of the recipients) Theres no 
other sport that moves as fast, hits as hard, and 
excites like ice hockey. The NHL should sponsor 
even more local hockey clinics than they already 
do. The more people play, the more people watch. 
Games in non-NHL cities expose non-hockey fans

; It was a good start-up touma; ment for us, senior John Borger 
i-said. Sophomore coach Chris 
Roteili felt they could have turned
over the two close losses to Grove 
City had they been able to warm 
up against weaker teams first. I 
wish wed played them later in 
the day, he said.
During the first game against 
Grove City, CMU was down 3-
10. They miraculously came back, 
earning 11 points, but it wasnt 
quite enough to win. Final scores 
were 11-13 for the first game and 
12-14 for the second, both tre
mendous efforts.
Starting setter, sophomore Rob 
Gannon, had a very good game, 
running plays well with opposite 
starter, senior Ed Pyo. Playing
smart, Pyo used the block set up 
against him to his advantage, 
reflecting his hits off their hands 
several times.
IUP proved to be a challenge in 
the semi-final competition, al
though CMU did triumph, tak
ing one game from them. Start
ing outside hitters junior Walt 
Miller and Borger had many ex
cellent digs on defense against 
this team which has notoriously 
strong front row hitters.
Other teams in pool play in
cluded Allegheny, South Hills, 
and South Brushton Church.
Overall, CMU consistently
served well, and their passing 
was a key factor in play through
out the tournament. Good execu
tion of plays in their 5-1, swing 
hitting offense, proved to work 
out well.
Other starting players were 
middle hitter sophomore Justin 
LaPaglia and senior hitter Zafier 
(Zap) Gan, a tremendous asset to 
the club. Sophomore Dwight Lee, 
second setter, has also been play
ing well. Freshman John (Nate) 
Heavey came back after knee 
problems which occurred at the 
end of October. Heavey is one of 
CMUs three strengths on offense,
along with Borger and Miller.
This past weekend, the club 
traveled to Maryland for a tour
nament on Sunday. They were 
somewhat limited because of 
transportation shortage that lim
ited the number of players who 
could participate. Results were 
unavailable after the meet.
Coming up, the volleyball club 
has weekend games on February 
19 and mid-semester break, Feb
ruary 26 and 28.
LaPaglia, a 6'4" middle hitter, 
has been playing volleyball for 
the past seven years, first in high 
school and thenfor the Pittsburgh
Golden Triangles Junior Olym
pic team.
LaPaglia is pleased with the 
way the season is going.
Our hitting and our attack isnt 
too bad, but our defense is lack
ing, he said. The team is more 
serious this year. Weve been run
ning many different plays, and 
have a fairly decent offense. 
LaPaglia credited the teams 
practice habits with much of its 
success.

Rockies, Marlins proved expansion label inaccurate
The Suicide Squeeze
by Anuj Gupta
For some teams, the label ex
pansion team continues to hang 
r:around them like a ball and chain. 
'Take, for example, the Seattle 
 Mariners, a team which, since its 
r.inception in 1969, has had only 
rtwo seasons with a winning per
centage over .500.
One can even look to the Na
tional Basketball Association, 
rwhere teams such as the Miami 
. Heat and Minnesota Timberwolves, recent additions to the 
NBA, continue to flounder to
wards the middle or bottom of 
their respective divisions.
But for the two newest kids on 
the professional sports block, the 
Colorado Rockies and Florida 
Marlins, the expansion labels 
which they acquired last year in 
''their inaugural season in the 
majors may be shed quicker than 
' you can say Toronto Blue Jays. 
' At the beginning of the 1993 
season, most prognosticators 
^ looked for the 93 version of the 
Rockies and Marlins to show a 
foreboding resemblance to the 62 
Mets. Little did they know that it 
would be the 93 Mets who would 
more closely resemble the inau
gural Mets team, instead of ei
ther first-year team.
Not only did both teams far 
. exceed everybodys expectations, 
~ but they also set the base for a 
not-too-distant prosperous fu
ture. Through a well-organized 
mix of prudent spending, strong 
fan base, and intelligent acquisi
tions in both player and mana
gerial personnel, the Rockies and 
Marlins have set themselves up 
to be contenders in their respec
tive divisions within just a few 
years.
Starting with the Rockies, the 
; thing that stands out most about 
this team is the incredible fan 
, support. In a season in which 
Major League attendance records
of all kinds were shattered in 
Mile High Stadium, the Rockies 
not only established themselves 
in the Denver area but also 
climbed to the top of the peak in 
terms of Major League merchan
dise and paraphernalia sold na
tionwide (a distinction previously 
held by the Chicago White Sox). 
With money pouring in from all 
sides, management held an edge 
which most expansion teams from 
the past have never had.
The edge was having capital 
which allowed management to 
take risks, and risks have been 
what owner Jerry McMorris has 
taken over the past year and a 
half, with most of them paying 
off. The first adventurous step 
McMorris took was with the draft 
day acquisition of Andres 
Galarraga, an expensive, over
weight and fading star, who had 
just been released by the St. Louis 
Cardinals.
Not only did Galarraga become 
the most popular Denver sports 
figure outside of John El way, but 
he also handily won a National 
League batting title. McMorris 
also went out on the edge by hir
ing a man with no previous mana
gerial experience, Don Baylor, 
only to have Baylor earn the re
spect of players and opposing 
managers from around the 
league.
Management surrounded these 
two key men with such discards 
by the names of Charlie Hayes, 
Jerald Clark, Dante Bichette, Eric 
Young, and Roberto Mejia. They 
form the nucleus of what has be
come one of the most formidable 
lineups in the National League.
Yet management didnt stop 
there, for this winter, McMorris 
went out and signed the likes of 
Ellis Burks, Walt Weiss, Howard 
Johnson, Mike Harkey, and 
Marvin Freeman to add to an 
already talented pool of players. 
And with the addition of Weiss at 
shortstop, Burks in center, the 
maturity of young Mejia at sec
ond and solid Joe Girardi behind 
the plate, the Rockies feature 
what could be one of the best up 
the middle defenses in the ma
jors.
Of course, McMorris is no god 
and thus has many holes to fill,
mainly in his pitching staff, which 
was dead last in the NL last year 
in earned run average. But there 
is hope, since number one pick 
Dave Nied showed promise last 
year after returning from the dis
abled list and starters Armando 
Reynoso and Greg W. Harris 
showed themselves to be fairly 
dependable. Added to that mix is 
the talented but oft-injured,
Mark Eggert/Tartan Art Co-Editor 
former number one pick of the 
Chicago Cubs, Harkey. Now the 
Rockies rotation, though lacking 
in experience, has a lot of bigtime talent.
As far as the bullpen goes, the 
Rockies relievers were definitely 
the butt of most baseball jokes up 
until midseason last year when a 
miraculous turnaround made the 
Rockies fans forget that at one 
point they were afraid to see Colo
rado relievers get into the game.
The turnaround started with 
closer Dairen Holmes, who, after 
a trip down to the minors in June 
became one of the most depend
able closers in the National 
League and finished with 25 saves 
with 60 strikeouts in 66 innings.
Add to that the fact that mid
inning pitchers such as Bruce 
Ruffin, Marcus Moore, and Mike 
Munoz began to show promise 
towards the end of last year. With 
the recent addition of Freeman, 
the Rockies at least have a formi
dable, if not imposing, core of 
relief pitchers.
The Rockies also feature a 
strong group of young prospects 
with the likes of Eric Wedge, Jay 
Gainer, John Burke, and Jim 
Tatum who are all waiting in the 
wings to make their mark.
Combine these elements along 
with-the teams financial secu
rity, and the Rockies should be 
able to stand ground until the 
novelty of a new baseball team 
wears off, and the Rockies are 
able to draw crowds because they 
are a bonafide contender.
Although the short history of 
the Florida Marlins is not as 
flashy as that of the Rockies, the 
Marlins have nevertheless man
aged to set themselves up for what 
could be a very successful ball 
club within two to three years.
Once again, the Marlins were 
blessed with something that most 
expansion teams have not been, 
which was due to the fact that the 
owner, Wayne Huizenga, has 
amassed a fortune through his 
Blockbuster Video business.
Yet, the direction of the Mar
lins, despite the owners fortunes, 
was clear from the start with the 
initial pick in the expansion draft 
of young outfield prospect Nigel 
Wilson, who was at least two years 
away from the majors, unlike his 
counterpart, Nied, who was cho
sen by the Rockies.
The Marlins, who already have 
a fairly solid lineup centered 
around such names as Gary 
Sheffield, Orestes Destrade, and 
Jeff Conine, could have gone for 
the big name free agents as the 
Rockies did in order to field a 
winning team sooner.
Yet they have continued to 
avoid that route over the course 
of the past year and a half, and 
have centered their attention on 
a slew of prospects, includingnew 
shortstop Kurt Abbottwho re
placed Weiss  which in a year 
or two could transform the Mar
lins into one of the fastest and 
best all-around hitting lineups in 
the majors.
The names such as Darrell 
Whitmore, Carl Everett, Charles 
Johnson, Scott Pose, and of course 
Wilson mean nothing to most as 
of now, but all have performed
extremely well in their first few 
professional seasons, and form a 
base for a successful Marlin fu
ture.
The club has not only managed 
to equip itself with able player 
personnel, but also did extremely 
Well in terms of management by 
picking Rene Lacheman as man
ager, for he has managed to earn 
the respect of the players, organi
zation and fans.
Huizenga may not have the gall 
that his counterpart, McNorris 
showed this winter by signing 
the big name free agents, but he 
has earned the respect of his 
peers by his actions including his 
willingness to move to the N.L. 
Central and give up a natural 
rivalry with the Atlanta Braves.
The Marlins may not possess 
the pizzazz and flair of the 
Rockies, but, like their newborn 
counterpart, they have estab
lished themselves in such a man
ner that the term expansion' 
may soon fall by the wayside and 
pennants are around the comer.

Dorsett leads Hall of Fame class
ATLANTA, January 29 (LAT-WP)  
Bud Grant, the former coach who led the 
Minnesota Vikings to four Super Bowl 
defeats, was voted to pro footballs Hall 
of Fame Saturday along with five former 
players, as the 33 selectors turned their 
backs on several qualified candidates.
Voted down in the lengthy election 
process were two Los Angeles Rams, 
Tom Mack and Jack Youngblood, and, 
among others, the quarterback who took 
the Raiders to two Super Bowl triumphs, 
Jim Plunkett.
Voted in were two running backs  
Tony Dorsett of the Dallas Cowboys and 
Leroy Kelly, who succeeded Jim Brown 
in the Cleveland Browns backfield.
Two defensive players also made it  
tackle Randy White of the Cowboys and 
Jimmy Johnson of the San Francisco 
49ers  along with tight end Jackie 
Smith, who played for the St. Louis 
Cardinals and, later, the Cowboys.
The three Cowboys set a modern oneteam, one-year record for the Hall of 
Fame, which will induct the six induct
ees next summer in Canton, Ohio.
On his way out of the crowded post
election news conference, an Eastern 
writer turned toaWestCoast writer and

Although Megahan is having a fine 
season for the Tartans, it does not ap
pear that she will be able to catch alumna 
Kathleen Segmiller, who holds the num
ber one spot on the all time CMU scoring 
list with 1,595 points.
The scoring load in the game was also 
shared by freshman Kelly Gaitens who 
had nine points and junior Jenny Gretz, 
with six points.
The Tartans were led in the rebound
ing category by both Megahan and
Another asked: Who was Jimmy 
Johnson?
The answer is that both were players 
who got nationwide support in the vot
ing process, which began several months 
ago.
Among those who got less support 
were Carl Eller and Paul Krause of 
Grants Viking defense; Lynn Swann 
and John Stallworth, wide receivers of 
the Pittsburgh Steeler teams that won 
four Super Bowls, and Charlie Joiner 
and Kellen Winslow, whose catches made 
San Diego Charger teams of the 1980s 
famous.
The electors also leaned heavily on the 
glamour side, refusing to name any of
fensive linemen, although Mack and Dan 
Dierdorf of the Cardinals lasted into the 
final rounds.
This years chosen six were described 
by several selectors privately as mem

classes in recent history.
Star bemoans Lakers fate
LOS ANGELES, January 29 (LATWP)  It used to be en vogue to watch 
the Lakers play, but now the in-thing 
seems to be deridingthe Lakers, and the 
latest to join in is Magic Johnson.
I dont think the guys have pride,
Kupfer who had four apiece, and by 
Megahan in assists with two.
The Tartans improved on their field 
goal percentage numbers from the Chi
cago game by shooting 37 percent for the 
game and a two-game best of 43 percent 
in the first period. They also improved 
on their percentage from three-point 
range, as they made four of six total 
shots in the game.
The Tartans also showed remarkable 
improvement from the free throw line as 
they shot 72 percent for the game versus
Sports Wire
Johnson said. I see teams coming in 
here laughing at us.
Johnson, in Atlanta on Thursday night 
to play in an exhibition at Georgia Tech, 
was interviewed by TNTs Craig Sager.
A portion of the interview was shown 
during halftimeof Friday nights Golden 
State-Utah game on TNT, and it will be 
shown in its entirety Monday night dur
ing halftime ofa Cleveland-Detroit game.
Sager asked: How painful is it to pick 
up the newspaper and see the Lakers 
(near) the bottom of the Pacific Division 
instead of the top?
Said Johnson: Its more painful going 
to games. Thats painful.
Whats so bad about it is the fact that 
it is something that you have built up 
and you have pride in that. I never 
thought in my wildest dreams that after 
I retired it would be this bad so quickly.
The thing that really disturbs me  
and this is the first time Ive said this 
because I havent been interviewed by 
anybody on this subject  whats so 
painful is the fact that I dont think the 
guys have pride.
We had pride. We lost a game and 
youd think we had lost 20 games. No
body said a word. We showered and no 
words. And we came back and made a 
point the next game we were going to 
kick somebodys butt because we werent
only 37.5 percent in the Chicago game.
Unfortunately, any improvement that 
the Tartans showed was overshadowed 
by the numbers that Wasington put up 
as they held a mark of 42 percent on field 
goals for the game and a high of 48 
percent in the second period. Washing
ton also out-rebounded the Tartans 45
24 and crushed them on the offensive 
side with 19 offensive boards for Wash
ington versus only four for the Tartans.
Washington University was led by 
Sarah Goldman and Jen Hendricks who
had 14 points apiece and Dana Bryant 
who added 10 points.
Wash. U. also stole the ball 17 times 
and played sparkling defense as they 
forced the Tartans to turn the ball over
30 times.
With the win, Washington improved 
to 15-3 overall (71 in the UAA) and the 
Tartans fell one game under .500 at 8-9 
overall (26 in the UAA).
The Tartans return to action next 
weekend on the road, against New York 
University and Brandeis University.
going to lose two games in a row.
Wetooklosseshard, and I dont think
I see the same thing now. I dont see it 
and Im there all the time. I dont see 
guys getting better, and I dont know if 
theyre working at it or what. Its tough 
for me.
This is the first time Ive said it, and 
now L.A.s going to go crazy saying, Oh, 
you didnt say it to us. 
Said Laker General Manager Jerry 
West at his home Saturday, It's really 
not that provocative. A lot of people 
think much the same way ... they just 
dont say it. Magic has the right to say 
whatever he wants to say.
No diploma, no Hall of Fame
LOS ANGELES, January 29 (LATWP)  Shaquille ONeal made big plays 
and earned lots of honors during three 
years of basketball at LSU. Then he got 
a huge NBA contract.
What he didnt get is a degree, and 
because of that he wont get something 
else: a place in the LSU athletic hall of 
fame.
A degree is mandatory for induction 
so Shaquille absolutely does not deserve 
to be in the Hall of Fame, said Hugh 
Buckingham, a member ofthe LSU Ath
letic Council. He not only didnt get a
degree, he left in the middle of the se
mester after his last season. It makes 
our rhetoric about educating athletes 
look like a sham.
Ex-Bull should avoid PGA
LOS ANGELES, January 29 (LATWP)  Danny Ainge, who played base
ball in the majors before switching to the 
NBA, had this to say to Tony Ginetti of 
the Chicago Sun-Times about the 
chances of Michael Jordan making it the 
other way around:
One thing Ill say is Michael has a 
better chance in baseball than making 
the PGA tour. Ive golfed with him.

By KYMBERLY M. BARTLO
Tartan Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon Ice 
Hockey Club spent a busy week 
on the ice, meeting up against 
two division rivals and playing 
two exhibition games. Last Sun
day, CMU went against Penn 
State West (PSW) in a home game 
and won 6-3.
Senior center Mike Gallin 
scored the first goal ofthe evening 
assisted by senior wing Jon 
Hutchison. Junior defenseman 
Greg Jessop scored the next CMU 
goal on a power play, and grad 
student right wing and team cap
tain Dave Umland scored another 
goal against PSW shortly there
after.
After PSWs second goal of the 
night, Jessop scored a power play 
goal with six seconds remaining 
in the second period. Freshman 
center Ray Ardire scored in the 
third period, and another last 
minute goal was scored by junior 
left wing John Cardillo on a power 
play into an empty net.
CMU played an exhibition 
game against Duquesne Univer
sity on Wednesday at the Civic 
Arena. The Dukes hung their 
heads at the end of the game as 
CMU beat them 9-6.
Three CMU goals were scored 
in the first period by Umland, 
Ardire, and grad student right 
wing George Mueller. The Dukes 
scored two against grad student 
goalie Scott Berry; both were 
power play goals.
Cardillo began the second pe
riod with a goal for CMU, then 
Duquesne scored. Sophomore 
center Roger Maddalena scored 
the fifth CMU goal. Duquesne 
managed to shoot another goal 
past the defense and Berry be
fore the period ended, CMU lead
ing 5-4.
Maddalena scored two more 
times in the third period, along 
with Umland and freshman left 
wing Chris Adukaitis. CMU had 
a goalie change as freshman Jon 
Kliegman took over for Berry, 
letting only two goals go past 
him.
With only one day of rest, CMU 
met up with Indiana University 
of PA (IUP) in a league away 
game, losing and breaking their
nine-game winning streak.
The first period was scoreless 
for both teams, although players 
from each side spent a lot of time 
in the penalty box, a trend which 
continued throughout the game. 
Maddalena scored for CMU in 
the second period after the Tar
tans were down 2-0 on a power 
play goal.
IUP got two more goals off of 
Berry before CMUs offense ral
lied to the attack with Jessop and 
Maddalena scoring. However, in 
a last minute decision, CMU 
yanked Berry out of the goal in 
the hopes of a strong offensive 
drive and only succeeded in giv
ing IUP an across the ice emptynet goal which finished any
chance of CMU catching up. Fi
nal score: 5-3.
On Saturday, CMU played 
again, pushing their resources to 
the absolute limit, against the

their loss the previous night, the

Swim team loses to Slippery Rock
By CAROLYN SKARADA
Tartan Assistant Sports Editor
On January 30 the mens and 
womens swim team traveled to 
Slippery Rock for their second to 
last meet of the season. Unfortu
nately both teams lost the meet, 
but there were several first place 
wins for individual and relay 
events.
Final score for the mens team 
was CMU 95, Slippery Rock 110. 
Highlights of the day include 
sophomore Matt Moes firstplace 
finishes in the 200-yard indi
vidual medley and 200-yard 
breaststroke with times of2:03.67 
and 2:14.97 respectively.
Moes time for the breaststroke 
is currently top in the UAA this 
year.
Moe earned All-UAA honors 
last winter when he came in sec
ond place in the 400-yard indi
vidual medley and third in the 
200-yard breaststroke. He was 
also a part of the third place 800- 
yard freestyle relay team.
While working towards UAA 
goals this meet was a step along 
the way, Moe said. He feels the 
team as a whole has been work
ing hard this year and its paying 
off. As for UAA personal goals 
Moe would like to set a record 
and win a few.
Senior co-captain ToddVandall 
finished his last meet of the sea
son with two individual first place 
wins, the 50-freestyle at 23.1 and 
the 100-freestyle at 50.40, and a 
first place finish in the 400- 
freestyle relay at 3:19.65. Other 
members in the rSlay were sopho
mores Geoff Waller and Mike 
Berty, and senior John Kline. 
Vandall will be taking the GREs 
on the day of the last meet.
At this point in the season
were swimming faster than we 
were last year, so were expecting 
to definitely place second in the 
UAAs and hopefully qualify a 
couple of relays for Nationals, 
Vandall commented.
He feels the key element oftheir 
successful season was the strong 
sophomore class.
Theyve improved since last 
year because they really trained 
hard, he said. Theyre a tal
ented bunch.
Other highlights were first 
place wins made by sophomores 
GeoffWaller and George Schmidt. 
Waller had a time of 1:49.8 for 
the 200-yard freestyle and 
Schmidt came in at 2:01.73 in the 
200-yard butterfly.
For the team, were supposed 
to [do well] and were really look
ing forward to UAAs, Schmidt 
said. Weve been practicing about
11 or 12 times a week for the past
three weeks to get ready for the 
UAAs. Were looking for the guys 
to go to nationals, and hopefully 
to do well there.
Final score for the womens 
team was CMU 75, Slippery Rock 
114. Sophomore Rebecca Freuhan 
set another school record during 
her first place win, the 1000-yard 
freestyle with a time of 11:02.9. 
Freuhan also won first place in 
the very next event, the 200-yard 
freestyle at 2:04.3.
Along with Freuhan, senior 
Denise Fenwick contributed a 
first place win in the 200-yard 
breaststroke. Her time for that 
event was 2:34.6.
In anticipation for the UAAs, 
senior co-captain Anupam Narula 
expressed his optimism.
Definitely a lot of National 
qualifiers in individual events for 
both men and women, he said of 
the Tartans goals. We really
stress doing well at UAAs be
cause the whole season is de
termined by what happens 
there and at Nationals.
Narulas prediction for quali
fiers, will probably be a hand
ful of sophomores including 
Waller, Moe, and Schmidt.
Coach Jim Cutrone also has 
high expectations. Were right 
on target for UAAs. Weve got 
lots of endurance, but needmore 
speed.
Cutrone is looking forward to 
the last meet of the season 
against Fairmont State College 
on February 5. Every year, he 
sets the UAA meet as a goal for 
his team, oftenusing dual meets 
as a training ground.
They have a small team, but 
some really strong swimmers, 
Narula said of the Fairmont 
meet. He added though, We 
expect to win this one.
Volleyball debuts

or four hours at a time.
Its hard to get gym time now 
LaPaglia said, talking about how 
the team sometimes has to leav( 
the gym because of varsity prac. 
tice.
LaPaglia lamented the teams 
club status, saying he wished 
they were a varsity sport.
We do the same amount 
work, but dont get the recognj. 
tion, he said.
Not only is transportation to 
the tournaments a problem 
as was the case with Sundays 
tournament  but each player 
must contribute to the costs of 
entering tournaments and 
penses such as uniforms and 
equipment.
Like many other clubs, the 
coach of theteam is a student, 
Rotelli, but that doesnt bother 
the team.

The mens team also 
traveled to Slippery 
Rock on January 29 to 
compete against similar 
teams.
Highlights forthemen 
include two third place 
finishes, the 55-meter 
hurdles with senior 
Gary Long and the 
4x400 meter relay. The 
relay team consisted of

 Womens track coach Dario Donatelli
Gregor.
Senior Jim Langer came in 
fourth place in the 1500 meter 
run.
The Tartans will compete at
Slippery Rock again next week
end in another invitational tour
nament. After that, they will com
pete in the West Virginia Invita
tional on February 12, then two
more meets at Robert 
Morris College on the 
following two week
ends.
The UAA champi
onships will be in 
March.
The outdoor track 
season will begin on 
March 26, with the 
Tartans competing at 
the University of Pittsburgh re
lays.
Hildebrande, one of the teams 
seniors and top distance runners, 
said this is going to be a big sea
son for the Tartans.
It looks good, she said. I 
feel good about it. Im positive 
that well have a good season.
There are a lot of freshmen, 
sophomores, and juniors who 
are coming out for the first time, 
so the team is [inexperienced, 
but] very strong at this time, 
she said.
Personally, she said her goal 
is to do well at the UAA cham
pionships in the 5,000-meter 
indoor [run]. She competes in 
the 10,000-meter run during 
the outdoor season.

offense & defense...
At left, freshman forward Penny 
Summerville, (#50), leads the women's 
basketball team against New York 
University. The Tartans have been solid 
on defense all year, but their offense has 
struggled. At right, senior forward Derek 
Draglsich drives in for two points against 
Brandeis University in recent action. 
Draglsich and the Tartans put up 82 
points against Washington University of 
St. Louis in their most recent game.

vys add fun to bedroom pCay
By KEEGAN FOLK
[ Man Contributing Editor
Lfor one, will never again think 
of Sex Week as boring or mun
dane. Not that Sex Week isnt an 
^formative and educational proTam, but if you know how to use 
! a' codom correctly, how much 
can it teach you, right? Wrong. 
On Friday night at the Womens 
Center, I learned more about sex 
than I have since I read Where 
Did I Come From?
The Womens Center sponsored 
;Sex Weeks Fuckerware Party. 
And no, they werent selling salad 
spinners.
< The Fuckerware Party offered 
| a chance for people to see some 
tsex toys and to find out just what 
you might want to do with them, 
he event wasnt as risqu asTh
one may think, actually. Good 
Vibrations, a sex toy store based 
in San Francisco, was the source 
for the items on display Friday 
night.
I got to see the Lipstick 
Smoothie, a little pocket-sized 
vibrator that travels easily. It 
comes in a variety of fashion col
ors.
Other toys included a giant, 
yellow vibrator, shaped like a 
banana, with a little face on the 
end and variable speed settings.
There was also a jelly-like, pink 
dildo. Wrist restraints and nipple 
clamps were demonstrated, but 
the small sized buttplug was not.
I was confused by why the ad
justable cockring was apparently 
sized for bulls, until someone used 
the dildo to demonstrate exactly. 
where a cock ringgoes. Who knew?
About 45 people showed up, a 
surprisingly large turnout for 
such an event.
The conversation started off on 
.the topic of masturbation. Imag
ine sitting in a room with 44 other 
people and talking about mas
turbating.
The discussion centered mostly 
on the benefits of knowing ones 
own body before embarking on a 
physical relationship with an
other body.
From masturbation, the talk 
turned to the differences between 
the male and female sexual expe
rience, and also the differences 
between individuals sexual ex
periences, which is really what 
we all want to know anyway, 
right?
So, you may be asking yours elf, 
why would so many people show
up to talk about sex with strang
ers? Well, I had to ask the same 
thing.
I wanted to have an event that 
focused on making safe sex fun, 
not just safe, said Jen Potter, 
member of the Womens Center. 
And it was fun.
Most people probably would not 
feel comfortable relating their 
various sexual experiences to 
strangers, but there were some 
people present on Friday night 
who were confident enough in 
themselves and their sexuality to 
offer advice and answer ques
tions.
Because ofthese people, I think 
a lot of others probably did learn 
a little something more about 
making safe sex fun sex  and 
where to get those items that can 
help you on your way to a safe
and exciting sex life.
Obviously, none of the toys were 
demonstrated first hand (except 
for in non-sexual ways, because 
vibrators do make good back 
massagers, you know).
It would probably have been 
even more fun to have someone do I?

Nicklas spent a good deal of the 
demonstration finding out what 
students wanted to learn about, 
and then working on those parts 
of the body.
She said stress often affects 
the head, back, and hands

those were the most

She showed techniques for 
easing lower back pain and re

back.
By the time she called to 
switch partners, the recipients 
were groaning in dismay.
The shoulders were the next 
body parts to be worked on.
With one partner still lying 
down, the pairs worked on the 
scapula, the wingbone and 
angelbone to help ease shoulder 
pain.
The final tips showed how to 
massage the face, then hands 
and feet. One technique was for 
relaxation, and another to re

Hands and feet, Nicklas said, 
are key because massaging them 
can affect the whole body.
She showed a variety of mas

relax the hands, and then 
showed how to drain fluid from

Tartan Diversions Co-Editor
ALLIES held a program en
titled Talking it out... last 
Wednesday as a part of Sex 
Week.
Though I knew little of the 
group before-hand, I was ex
posed to some interesting view
points on sexual diversity at 
CMU. These opinions, put forth 
by the members of the group, 
made me look at the campuswide and even the national prob
lems that plague the diverse 
culture in which we live.
The discussion group began 
with a number game for which 
digits from one to ten were taped 
to the walls. A question was then 
asked, and depending on the 
amountyou agreed or disagreed, 
you were to choose a number 
under which to stand. Though 
skeptical at first, I began to see 
the reasoning behind this open 
sharing of strong opinions.
It started small: Did you at 
one time feel that CMU was the 
right choice for you?and pro
gressed to questions concerning 
the feelings of safety and com
fort for homosexuals on campus. 
Often these questions cut to the 
chase and seemed to deal with 
the problems strongly and au
thoritatively. At this point many 
poigniant comments were made.
Everyone could give their 
opinions, feelings, and reasons 
for their choice. Much of the dis
cussion was centered on how 
opinions are relative to previous 
experience, said Katarina
Midelfort, senior chemistry 
major, and president of AL
LIES.
Statements ranged from 
When I decided to attend CMU, 
I knew it was the right school for 
me, to I think Carnegie Mellon 
is diverse by sexual orientation, 
to Our campus is a safe place for 
gay, lesbian, and bisexual stu
dents, staff, and faculty., says 
Midelfort of the range of opinions 
and discussions presented.
Despite many of these positive 
opinions, people generally be
lieved that there was a lack of 
diversity on campus, sexual or 
otherwise, and went on to de
scribe their experiences.
I learned that many people con
sidered CMU to be only lightly 
integrated, an opinion I had never 
thought about before, though a 
fact I have noticed about campus.
Midelfort said in retrospect of 
the evenings program, Another 
discussion was about feeling com
fortable confronting people who 
make oppressive statements.
"In this respect, everyone was 
in agreement that they were try
ing to learn to do this better, and 
a few people had confronted uni
versity administrators and oth
ers in the past when oppressive 
statements had been made.
Midelfort says in respect to this 
discussion, as well as other dis
cussions held throughout the 
evenings program, This gave 
encouragement for all to try to 
stand up for what they believe 
in. This is actually what the 
ALLIES group is all about.
ALLIES is a group of students, 
staff, and faculty which provides 
support for gay, lesbian, and bi
sexual members of the campus 
community.
Our members in
clude straight, gay, lesbian, and 
bisexual people. We were created 
to give a place where everyone 
can support gay, lesbian, and bi
sexual rights without being clas
sified as gay, lesbian, or straight, 
said Midelfort.
Though I felt a little out of place 
in the group, as I really hadnt 
considered or even thought about 
any of the ideas they, or anyone 
else, put forth, the group as a 
whole was friendly and open 
about their opinions and prob
lems. After seeing the harsh treat
ment some of my friends have 
experienced for exposing their 
sexuality and ideas in the past, 
this ALLIES program was an 
open and enjoyable experience.
Most of this ALLIES presenta
tion discussed problems I had 
never experienced and feelings I 
had never had.
However, it pointed out to me 
the lack of diversity on campus 
and the many opinions in our 
campus community concerning 
sexuality. The ALLIES are a 
friendly group who are trying to 
allow these different views to 
become mainstream ideas and to 
let those views become a part of 
our personal ideals.
I found this to be an eye open
ing and educational program that 
enhanced the general fun of the 
Sex Week program over the past 
week.
ALLIES meets every other 
Wednesday in the West Wing TV 
room, including this 
Wednesday, at 8 
pm.

Horror Stories
by Tom Harper
It never fails. I have come so 
close to just giving up cleaning 
my side of the room.
No matter how organized I 
manage to get it, every book, piece 
of paper, article of clothing, dust 
bunny, and the odd homework 
papersomehowfindsitswayback 
to the original place in the origi

So once when I had absolutely 
nothing to do (and that was along 
three minutes), I thought about 
the history of my rooms through
out my life, and, sure enough, I 
couldnt run across one that was 
clean for more than two days.
My parents told me that when 
I was a baby I loved to throw 
things out of my crib and onto the 
floor. Apparently I loved to do it a 
lot.
Judging from the nitpicky be
havior my mom exhibited later in 
my life, I can imagine her reac
tion to my sudden launching of 
toys.
Mom: HeylYou cant throw our 
toys all over the floor and make a 
mess! Red this place up! It looks 
like a pig sty!
Me: Gaawoo.
Mom: You should learn not to 
throw all this stuff all over the 
place. It leads to bad habits.
Me: Gaawoo.
Then I remember having to 
share a room with my big brother, 
and he was messier than I was. 
Eventually the room was divided 
into two distinct regionsmy 
mess and his.
But the funniest part was when 
the messes would eventually start 
to filter out of the room like a big
mass of slime and infiltrate the 
living room.
Mom: Put this stuff away! You 
cantwalk through this 
room!
Then one day after 
she said that, I care
fully arranged the toys 
in the living room so 
one could walk through 
the mess and be in no 
danger of slipping and 
breaking ones neck.
Me: Look mom! Now 
you can walk through 
it!
I dont remember 
much of what hap
pened after that.
When it got too bad 
in there, my mom 
would just cave in and 
clean the room herself. Then I 
couldnt find what I wanted be
cause she had put it all in some 
really obscure place, like the 
closet. And she said it was my 
fault that I couldnt find it!
I asked why it was my fault, 
and she said, Because I said so." 
That parental-intimidation-without-logic was fine when I was 
elementary school, but once in 
high school I just had to start 
questioning the Because I said 
so.
After that she just gave up
cleaning my room entirely (thank 
God) and so my room was at last 
my room. Well, it wasnt actually 
MY room until my senior year of 
high school when my big brother 
left and my little brother had a 
room of his own (the neatest room 
I ever did see, I might add).
Then, my room was downstairs 
(the coldest room in the entire 
house, I might add). It was also 
next to the gun cabinet; so if some
one wanted to break in in the 
middle of the night Id be the first 
line of defense.
And of course my room became 
the messiest room in the house, 
possibly in the entire neighbor
hood.
But I could find anything I 
wanted, until my mom broke her 
vow of never stepping into my 
messy room again. She put all my 
favorite junk in a bigbox for me to 
sort through.
Of course, I sorted them out 
using the pile method: A pile for 
everything, and everything in its
pile.
And now, Im away from hpn,

Moms House provides options for student parents

reliefs face facts. Student pregnancy  and its consequences  
remains a well-avoided topic here at CMU.
".'Jhe deep-seated controversy surrounding a womans decision to 
Either terminate or pursue her pregnancy imposes its own societal 
K rule.
iafhis being the case, the students most desperately in need of the 
Universitys broad support network often fall through its chinks  
those who choose to terminate their pregnancies act in silence, and 
'{Rose who choose to pursue other alternatives simply leave school.
fto matter what the final outcome, student parents are a rarity. 
WKy? Most students would argue the work ethic.
Juggling parenthood and a full course load is deemed by many to 
"bfckn impossibility.
The problem of finding adequate day care is only one of the many 
challenges facing student parents.
Fortunately, one of Pittsburghs best-kept secrets provides soluiftons to this and other parental concerns.
tor student parents at many other universities, Moms House
provides the support that keeps them in school.
Founded in 1983, Moms House is a privately funded comprehen
sive program that takes a practical and progressive approach at 
keeping low-income single mothers in school.
By offering free daycare, counseling, and tutoring services, Moms 
House administers not only to the needs of the child, but of the 
student parent as well.
The mothers are as much clients as the children are, says Mary 
Winter, the executive director of the program.
All mothers must meet three criteria to enter Moms House: they 
must be single, have a proven low income, and take classes full time.
The Swissvale and the Brookline locations both house 45 mothers 
and children, and each typically have a waiting list of at least 10 
people.
To remain in Moms House, mothers have to maintain at least a C 
average in their classes. Most do better.
Why is the sucess rate of Moms House so high? Program volun
teers cite the prevailing positive attitude as the cause.
[Moms House] is more than a day-care center, says Brookline 
program director Maggie Kohler.
It promotes life and the love of family. The mothers at Moms
House will tell you that Moms House is part of that family.
For many students facing unplanned pregnancies, choosingtq 
raise a child means dropping out of school.
Moms House provides a viable alternative to this unfortume \ 
norm. Such lofty ideals are best summed up in Winters wore,: 
When you give people support and encouragement and let thei 
know youre there for them, there are no heights they cant reach1

Giron feels that this book will

When asked how he knows a

Giron answers, After a first read

After a second reading, therell 
be 120 questions. And after 25 
years, hopefully therell be no 
more questions and the script will 
be ready. Thats what happened 
with Edith Stein.
What excites Giron the most 
about the development of his writ
ing is what he can give to his 
students. I want to take people 
with me. All these opportunities 
that are happening to me can 
then open up opportunities for 
them. I can help prepare my stu

explains.
Brian Silberman, a second year

ofthe good things about Arthur is 
that he takes each student on 
their own terms. He is very sup
portive of us, which is something 
you dont often find.

Club Xes flops at end of Sex Week
By KATHY WRIGHT
partan Features Co-editor
On Friday night, Sex Week 
came to a triumphant close with 
|ts-Glub Xes video dance. 
Actually, maybe Im 
jxagerating just a little. Did ev
eryone know that it was Sex 
Week?
I caught sight of a table tent
too, and it seems that the timing 
was just plain bad.
Since Sex Week as a whole 
didnt receive much publicity, 
neither did the individual events.
Several of the events seemed to 
be tucked away on the far reaches 
of campus, as opposed to taking 
advantage of more visible loca
tions, such as Skibo.
The one attempt to move into
... the image frozen on the video 
tj screen (more like a large screen 
TV) and the flashing colored lights 
(more like a stop light or a neon 
sign) were a nice touch.
one day, no more than two weeks 
;ago, and ever since then I have 
expected to hear an anticipatory 
buzz across campus.
Luckily I didnt get mt hopes 
up. I never actually heard the 
mention of Sex Week once. What. 
a pity! I thought it would have 
caused more of a stir on campus 
than it had. On a college campus 
I would expect that anything to 
do with sex would at least bring 
as much response as anything to 
do with beer.
: For one, the word just never 
8eemed to get out about Sex Week. 
Sex Week came earlier this year,
the public eye, Club Xes, flopped.
Most people didnt know about 
the dance until hearing the mu
sic in the halls of Skibo or on the 
sidewalk outside. Even then there 
might not have been much temp
tation to step inside because of 
the monotonous tones inherent 
in extended remix versions of bad 
techno.
A few people braved the music 
to sweat it out on the dance floor, 
but, for a while there, campus 
security outnumbered the danc
ers.
I might add that the image fro
zen on the video screen (more like
a large screen TV) and the flash
ing colored lights (more like a 
stop light or a neon sign) were a 
nice touch.I have to give the disc 
jockey some credit, though.
Half way through the evening 
he actually cleared the dance floor 
by playing two slow songs in a 
row.
Not a smart move, but he did 
lure a small crowd, back when 
later in the night he started play
ing some danceable late 80s clas
sics and some popular 90s songs 
that used to be all the rage.
One would think that since the 
whole week focused on sex, that 
the dance would have incorpo
rated some theme related to sex. 
But maybe that would have been 
to risque.
In all, I found this event a let 
down to the anticipated climax of 
Sex Week.
I feel Sex Week didnt 
acoomplish what it intended to at 
all because judging from the over
all participation and enthusiasm, 
it seemed as though nobody knew 
it was happening.

Lecture teaches safety
By BETHANY SUTTON
Tartan Staffwriter
Every two seconds a 
crime is committed...One ag
gravated assault every twentyeight seconds...One forcible 
rape every five minutes...One 
murder every 22 minutes.
These were just a few the 
many statistics cited by the 
private nationwide organiza
tion, Citizens Against Crime, 
in their crime preven
tion seminar, Living 
Safely in a Danger
ous World, held 
Tuesday night inthe 
Morewood Gardens 
Recreation Room.
With the number 
of violent crimes in
creasing at an alarm
ing rate both nation
ally and locally, 
knowledge of how to 
keep out of situations 
and how to deal with 
them once you are 
involved is essential 
in todays world.
It can happen to 
you and, most likely, 
it will, was the mes
sage espoused by veteran Citi
zens Against Crime spokesper
son Linda Roman.
Concentrating on crimes 
which occur in and around cars, 
Roman outlined a few basic 
safety measures which should, 
she told her audience, become 
a routine part of everyones 
daily routine.
You should have your keys 
in your hand before going out
side into the parking lot, look 
underneath and around, then 
inside, the car, examining es
pecially the backseat, and im
mediately lock the doors once 
you are inside.
Following these easy steps 
could end up saving your life.
Roman went on to talk about 
the smash-and-grab (in 
which a criminal will smash 
the drivers side window at a 
stop light to steal something 
sitting on the front seat), 
bumper crimes, car-jackings, 
and automobile breakdowns.
Also discussed were the
proper safety measures one 
should follow when using MAC 
machines.
Focusing on her largely female 
audience, Roman devoted a sig
nificant portion of the program to 
the crime of rape.
Although most statistics main
tain that a forcible rape in 
America occurs every five min
utes, it has been estimated that 
between fifty and eighty percent 
of all rapes go unreported; that 
raises the rate to a horrifying
ing the trigger on another per
son with the intent to kill.
Roman advocates chemical 
defense spray, legal in every 
state exceptNew York, Massa
chusetts, California, and Wis
consin, as the most effective 
weapon of self-defense.
More specifically, the spray, 
to be more effective, should con
tain military CS tear gas, OC, 
ultraviolet dye, and a high qual
ity solvent base.
These contribute to the eflevel of once every fifteen sec
onds.
There are six stages of rape, 
the first four of which usually go 
largely undetected: target, test, 
threat, transportation, transac
tion, and termination.
Because nearly eight-five per
cent of campus rapes occur with 
someone the victim knows, Ro
man stressed the importance of 
recognizing these early signs. 
Fight to incapacitate is the 
idea should a woman find herself 
in such a situation, using such 
self-explanatory self-defense 
methods as the eyeball thrust 
and testicle jerk.
Discussing the pros and cons of 
guns, she maintains that if you 
feel you will only be safe possess
ing a firearm, you have three 
responsibilities to fulfill: it must 
be of high quality (i.e., it must be 
relatively expensive, usually cost
ing at least $200), you must know 
how to use it responsibly, you 
must be able to shoot it correctly, 
and you must be capable of pullMark Eggert/Tartan Art Co-editor
fectiveness of the spray by in
capacitating the attacker, yet 
causes no permanent medical 
damage.
Items such as Defender Plus, 
the chemical defense spray 
manufactured by Citizens 
Against Crime, as well as door/ 
window security stickersand 
Emergency Call Police signs, 
were available for purchase 
following the program.
Whether or not one chose to 
buy any of the products for 
sale, the program taught many 
of us in attendance invaluable 
lessons in personal safety, selfdefense, and crime prevention. 
It should be a program adver
tised throughout the entire 
campus because everyone can 
benefit from the tips presented.

Laddergrams
by Mark Kantrowitz
In a laddergram, the object 
is to transform the word 
on the top rung into the 
word on the bottom rung 
in the least number of 
steps. During each step 
you must replace one 
letter in the previous word 
so that a new word is 
formed, but without 
changing the positions of 
the other letters. For 
example, we can change 
LEAD into GOLD in just 
three steps: LEAD. LOAD, 
GOAD. GOLD.

DIVERSIONS
Laughter reigns at AB Comedy Night
By JASON ANDRACKI
[! Tartan Staffwriter
Not only did AB Coffeehouse 
['begin this semester of comedy 
acts with a great show, they also 
I! launched the first annual Comedy Night on Saturday in the 
Skibo Ballroom. For the extremely reasonable price of $3, 
students were treated to two 
hours of hilarious comedy from 
Wendy Liebman, Mitch Mullany, 
and Selected Hilarity. Although I 
was skeptical about paying for an
AB Coffeehouse event, since Im 
used to the events being free, I 
easily got my moneys worth.
Starting off the evening was 
Selected Hilarity from Chapel 
Hill, North Carolina. These five 
guys were introduced by Jill 
Goodall, AB Coffeehouse chair, 
as the Menudo of stand-up. With 
that introduction I wasnt too 
excited, but right away they had 
me laughing with their imper
sonation game show. If that 
wasnt funny enough, Selected
courtesy of Peng Hwang/TheThistle 
; Comedian Wendy Liebman and sophomore John Doan.
Hilarity then moved on to impro
visation. They invited the audi
ence (which, by the way, should 
have been larger) to shout lout 
forms of music; the responses 
were country, reggae, and rap. 
Then the members of Selected 
Hilarity requested a word or a 
phrase, for example, plankton, 
and received Road kill, Youre 
ugly and your momma dresses 
you fanny, and Spam tastes 
damn good. Then, as two mem
bers of Selected Hilarity pre
tended to be announcers from 
Great Britain Top of the Pops, 
the three remaining members 
performed videos correspond
ing to the musical genres and 
phrases shouted by the audience. 
I was amazed at how quick and 
hilarious this performance was, 
considering that they were im
provising. Selected Hilarity per
formed a short but extremely 
humorous act.
Next up was Mitch Mullany, 
who has been seen on MTV, Copiic 
Strip Live, Evening At the Improv, 
VH1, and other comedy shows. 
Mullanys act started off slow
compared to Selected Hilaritys, 
or as he described them, the five 
clean guys, rapid delivery. The 
crowd wasnt quiet for very long, 
though. The laughs were coming 
quickly with Mullanys anecdotes 
about his family that consisted of 
a neurotic mother, a dopey fa
ther, one brother who thought he 
was Bruce Lee, and the other 
who thought he was Spider-Man. 
Other family jokes were also well 
received, especially a story about 
him playing Barney for his nieces 
birthday. He said that as little 
kids were hyperventilating, 
mothers were giving him their 
phone numbers because he had 
the bottom half of the dinosaur 
suit on backwards. In my opinion 
Mullanys best jokes involved his 
interaction with the audience. He 
commented that everyone only 
laughed in quick bursts because 
they paid $3 and didnt want any 
pauses. Mullany then began to 
refer to himself as the Comedy 
Ho because of this. It seems that 
Mullany really enjoyed perform
ing here but didnt like the back 
curtain too much. When his time
was up, Mullany kept coming 
back on stage to enjoy the ap
plause even when Jill Goodall 
was announcing the headlining 
performer.
The final comedian of the first 
annual Comedy Night was Wendy 
Liebman, who was the star of her 
own VH1 special, and has also 
appeared on 48 Hours, The To
night Show, MTV, and Comic 
Strip Live, among others. Right 
from the beginning, Liebman had 
the crowd roaring with her rapid 
delivery of jokes. Before you were 
even done laughing from one joke, 
she had already told another one 
to keep you laughing throughout 
her whole 50 minute act. Most of 
Liebmans jokes were delivered 
in an offhand manner, much like 
she was making a sarcastic com
ment under her breath rather 
than jokes meant for an audi
ence. This straight faced, some
what subliminal, style of comedy 
was quite effective for Liebman. 
Her jokes ranged from her exhusband and other dating sto
ries, to the now mandatory 
Bobbitt-penis joke about getting
her cat spayed. She also tied in 
other current events like the re
cent LA earthquake, as she talked 
about how she sought safety in a 
doorway along with some 
Jehovahs Witnesses. Liebmans 
anecdotes were funny, but her 
one-liners were what stole the 
show. When she talked about her 
childhood and mentioned getting 
weighed, Liebman said in her off
hand manner, It was on a Rich
ter scale. She ended her act with 
some impressions, like Alex 
Trebecks wife, What, is no! 
Liebman was an excellent head
liner with her rapid wit that had 
the audience laughing through
out her entire act.
Although it was a slightly small 
audience, AB Coffeehouses first 
annual Comedy Night was still a 
success. It was difficult, since this 
was a first, to convince people to 
spend money for something they 
got for free last semester. But the 
crowd certainly got more than $3 
worth of comedy. I cant wait for 
next years Comedy Night if it 
will even be half as funny as this 
one.
Schindler's List captivates, frightens viewers
By DAN GOLDWASSER
j \Tartan Junior Staffwriter
| The Holocaust was a terrible time in history. 
Over 12 million people were killed, six million of 
I [ them Jews. During World War II, there were many 
i people who risked their lives to save the Jews that 
| Hitler sought to destroy. Some did it out of good 
will, others did it for love. Oskar Schindlerdid it for 
money.
1 Steven Spielberg {E. T., Jurassic Park, Raiders of 
! the Lost Ark) directed Schindlers List, a powerful 
[and moving film based on the true story of Oskar 
\ Schindlers efforts to save over i,000 Jews during 
; the Holocaust. Schindler, played impeccably by 
Liam Neeson (Darkman, Excalibur), was a man 
j who saw his chance at the beginning of World War 
ill, and moved to Nazi-occupied Poland to open a 
'factory and employ Jews at starvation wages. His 
goal was to become a millionaire. By the end of the 
war, he had risked his life and spent his fortune to 
save those Jews, and had defrauded the Nazis for 
* months with a munitions factory that never pro
duced a single usable shell.
! Schindler dresses expensively, proudly sporting 
! a Nazi party emblem on his coat. He buys cham
pagne and caviar for Nazi officers, and gets his 
picture taken with the top brass. The right man to 
know, the authorities are more than happy to help 
him open a factory to manufacture enameled cook
ing utensils for army kitchens. By employing 
Jews, whose wages are lower, Schindler can make 
more money.
A gambler, a drinker, and a womanizer, Schindler 
is nowhere near perfect. He knows how to con, 
bribe and scheme, but nothing about running a 
factory. Schindler hires Itzhak Stern (Ben 
Kingsley), a Jewish accountant, to handle that side 
of things. Stem moves through the streets of 
Krakow, hiring Jews for Schindler. Because J the 
factory is a protected war industry, a job there piay 
be a guarantee of a longer life.
During the liquidation of the Krakow Ghetto, 
Schindler and his wife (Caroline Goodall) are jon 
horseback, riding on the hills above the city. From 
there, they can see the brute force tactics thatjthe 
Nazis use to round up the Jews. Schindler notices 
a girl wearing a red coat, the only color in the film, 
running from the Nazis and disappearing into a 
building. This girl in the red coat is symbolic of the 
destruction of the innocent, a theme which is as 
powerful in this film as a punch to the face.
After the Ghetto is cleared, all the Jews are to be 
moved into the Plazow Work Camp. However, 
Schindler is able to convince Nazi Commandant 
Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes) to allow some Jews to 
continue working at his factory. Goeth is a study 
in the stupidity of evil. From the verandah of his 
villa, overlooking the prison yard, he shoots Jews 
for target practice. Schindler is able to talk him out 
of this custom with an appeal to his vanity so 
obvious it is almost an insult.
Goeth is a hypocrite who upholds an ideal but 
then makes himself an exception to it. First, he 
preaches the death of the Jews, and then chooses a 
pretty one named Helen Hirsch (Embeth Davidtz) 
to be his maid, finally falling in love with her. He 
does not find it atrocious that her people are being 
exterminated and she is spared on his affectionate 
whim. He sees his personal needs as more impor
tant than right or wrong, life or death.
Filmed on location in Poland, Spielberg chose to 
capture the film in black and white, since that is 
the only way that he has seen pictures of the 
Holocaust. He was so confident in Jurassic Park 
that he left for Poland before that film was even 
completed. There were times when he felt he 
would have had a nervous breakdown and was
thankful that his family was there with him. This  
film is a departure from the style of film-making  
that we would so often associate with Spielberg.  
There are no trademark panoramic shots, and  
even John Williams score is a collection of themes 
and orchestral remembrances so different from 
Spielbergs other films that the music will haunt 
you after you have left the theater.
Most recently, Schindlers List was honored at 
the Annual Golden Globe Awards by the Holly
wood Foreign Press. There, it won awards for Best_ 
Picture (Drama), Best Director (Spielberg), andBest Screenplay. Running a little over three hours, 
this film seems to go by almost too quickly; there is 
so much to convey, and only so much time. This is 
a film that you should make time for in your 
schedule. It is an example of perfection in acting, 
film-making, and direction, and should not go 
unseen.
Superman rebirth features exciting new developments
! I thought that once the death, funeral, 
and rebirth of Superman was wrapped 
up that DCs Superman titles would go 
i back to being somewhat mediocre and 
uneventful. Wow, was I ever wrong, 
j Beginning with Supermans death last 
October, this has been, in my opinion, 
i the most exciting line of books in all of 
comicdom. Of course, the Death of Su
perman, Funeral for a Friend, and 
Reign of the Supermen were going to 
be great, but I never suspected these

than four separate monthly books. This 
is especially evident in the storylines 
Spilled Blood and the current one 
Bizarros World, plus sub-plots like 
books would still be so good even after Lois Lanes investigation of Sasha 
the story was finished months ago, and Greens disappearance, and Supermans 
ithey show no signs of slowing down. increase in powers. The writers (Roger 
| Its really amazing how well these four Stern in Action Comics, Karl Kesel for 
v books flow into each other, even though Adventures of Superman, Dan Jurgens 
there is a different creative team on of Superman, and in Superman  The 
each. Its more like a weekly title rather Man of Steel, Louise Simonson) also did
an excellent 
jobtyingupthe

cially liked 
how they ex

occurring at 
the same time 
as Super

they really 
handled the 
four other Su
permen better 
than I ex
pected. I just 
hope they 
bring back the 
Eradicator 
soon.
Perhaps myBizarro is back making trouble for Superman.
 1994 DC Comics
favorite storyline since Reign has to be 
the current Bizarros World. Of course, 
I would like this just because it involves 
a Super-foe from the days of the old 
Superfriends cartoon which featured 
heroes like Superman, Green Lantern, 
and Aquaman from the Hall of Justice 
fighting the Legion of Doom (not the 
professional wrestlers) consisting of 
Bizarro, Brainiac, Black Manta, and oth
ers. Everything about this story is great, 
from the logo with the backwards num
bers and the Superman logo being back
wards to Lex Luthor II losing his hair. I 
especially like the humor Bizarro brings 
to the books. A great example of this is 
Lois (or Lo-iz) speaking like Bizarro when 
she was his captive. Its great to see the 
intelligent reporter saying things like, 
And me save Lois, and Of course you 
am.
Although Ive talked a lot about the 
writers, I dont discount the artists. I 
especially admire Barry Kitson of Ad
ventures of Superman and Jackson Guice 
from Action, Comics. Also Stuart 
Immonen did  great job on Superman 
#87 and Im glad to see hes also guesting 
on #88 too. Ive never seen an artist draw 
such lifelike facial features as Immonen. 
I certainly would be very pleased if he 
took over the reigular art chores.
In addition to the Bizarros World 
storyline, there are also some more in
teresting plot developments that need 
mentioning. Some of them include Lex 
Luthors plan for immortality and its 
backfiring with Lex II being struck with 
the same illness that is plaguing the Underworlders since he is a clone like them. 
Also, Supermans increase in power is 
getting very interesting, especially with 
his super-hearing backfiring on page 
five in Adventures #510.
This is certainly something to 
watch for in upcoming months. How
ever that does not seem that exciting 
when you compare it to the last page 
of Action Comics #696. Yes, just as 
Superman didnt die, it seems that 
neither did Doomsday. Ive heard that 
the Superman Doomsday re-match 
will occur sometime in March and

81/2
Often imitated but never equaled, Fellinis mas
terpiece 81/2 may be the greatest film ever made 
about the mind of a filmmaker. Winner of the 
Oscar for Best Foreign Film in 1963, 81/2 stars 
Marcello Mastroianni as the director struggling 
with himself to create the masterpiece which is 
expected of him.
Exhausted and hounded by both his wife and 
mistress, he escapes into his personal fantasies. 
The result is the recognition that his future work 
must come from the experiences in his life. It is the 
story of an artist as only Fellini could present it.
Italian with English sub-titles.
At 6, 8:30 pm, and midnight.
Friday, February 4
Carlitos Way
A bearded AL Pacino stars as Carlito Briganti in 
this gritty story by Brian DePalma. Carlito, an exhitman, tries to open a legitimate business in his 
old neighborhood after being released from prison. 
However, he cant go home again, it seems, even 
though his lawyer, David Kleinfeld (Sean Penn) 
swears Carlito is a changed man. After he begins 
running a disco in his old neighborhood, the Mafia 
closes in and he is once again entrenched in the 
hard life of a killer, causing him to return to his life 
of crime.
Also starring Penelope Ann Miller as Gail, 
Carlitos girlfriend, this movie deals with the prob
lems of going straight and keeping out of harms 
way. Though the story is interesting, Pacino does 
not portray his character incredibly well. Also, De 
Palma, once in top form with The Untouchables, 
disappoints but still manages to make a fairly 
interesting and suspenseful film.
If you enjoyed Pacinos Scent of a Woman, there 
should be no reason for you not to enjoy this film. 
Although mildly lower in quality, Carlitos Way is 
a fine film by a fine acting/directing team.
At 5, 7:30,10 pm, and 12:30 am.
Saturday, February 5
Real Genius
This campus comedy starring Val Kilmer is 
about a group of geniuses in a college think-tank. 
Directed by Martha Coolidge, the film is filled with 
quirky characters/caricatures that are fairly funny 
in their own right. At a school for gifted students 
where stress makes the students crazy, patterned 
after schools like Cal-Tech, this wacky group of 
mad-cap kids discover that they are being used by 
the government to build a precision air-strike 
laser. In the end, however, they prevail, and so as 
not to spoil the ending, well only say that they 
realize they forgot the butter.
Also starring Gabe Jarret and Patti D 
Arbanville, this comedy makes for a good time.
At 6, 8,10 pm, and midnight.
Sunday, February 6
