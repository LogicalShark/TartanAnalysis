Special to The Tartan
For the first time in over 10 years, a 
company other than the American 
Building Maintenance Company 
(ABM) will be handling CMUs custo
dial services. CMU awarded a fiveyear contract to Pittsburgh-based 
iCantral Property Services (CPS) to 
[handle those services, and CPS will 
take over completely on February 1.
ABM has had the custodial job for 
almost 15 years, said Ronald Carter, 
CMUs assistant vice president for 
facilities management services, and 
! in that time, they had always fulfilled 
the terms of their contract.
However, according to Carter, CMU 
i felt that the time had come to improve 
the overall quality of cleanliness, so 
| theUmversity opened up the contract 
i conducted a competitive process 
I to select a company.
We believe weve negotiated a very 
favorable agreement in that it is go
ing to lead to improved aesthetics in 
our facilities, said Carter. The ABM 
contract expired November 30, and 
: we began a process six to eight months 
prior to that date to redefine the scope 
| of services and identify the areas we 
wanted to refocus our custodial ser
vices on.
r Jthough ABM was one of the top 
give firms in the competition, CPS 
j won the top ranking among the nine 
firms competing, and a contract was 
subsequently worked out with them.
A point I want to make is that the 
management team here was ex
tremely pleased with ABM over the 
years, Carter said. They fulfilled 
their contractual agreements, but we 
have been hearing from our custom
ers, and we knew that people wanted 
something different.
They [ABM] were not fired, they 
just didnt win the contract. We be
lieve they served the University very 
well over the years. ABM is a quality 
company, and I hope I can be saying 
the same thing about CPS down the 
road  I fully expect to be able to do 
that.

Dining Services initiates changes

Eat N Park, a Pittsburgh-based restau
rant chain, will serve as Dining Services 
primary contractor until June 30, 1996, 
helping to operate the Universitys dining 
halls, catering service, and faculty club.
The deal comes after the Marriott Cor-- 
poration, an outside company that oper1 
ated and managed dining services at Car
negie Mellon for more than 15 years, unex
pectedly broke its contract last November.
Weve formed a partnership with Eat N 
Park while we plan for the opening for the 
University Center, said Neil Binstock, 
assistant vice president for business ser
vices. Weve made significant changes 
since schools opened and have received 
positive feedback.
Since Marriotts departure, the Univer
sity has assumed full management of all of 
its dining services to respond better and 
faster to customer concerns, said Binstock.
When the Eat N Park idea emerged it 
was something that was really exciting, 
said Mike Murphy, dean of student af
fairs. They have a tremendous reputation 
nationally and are a true Pittsburgh suc
cess story.
With Eat N Parks help, Dining Services 
will be able to acquire almost all of its foods 
from the Pittsburgh region  including 
local markets such as the Strip District. 
Under Marriott, some foods were being 
shipped from distributors as far away as 
Ohio and Maryland.
Eat N Park allows us to buy food 
locally and get good prices on food and 
food products, said Binstock. But the 
real advantage is that they are a Pitts
burgh company, which is better for us, 
and better for the economy.
Eat N Park, with its 65 locations, is 
also providing the University with five 
employees to help with food service and 
production. They will also give corporate 
and marketing support.
Since the start of the semester, innova
tions have already been made to allow for 
more meals being cooked to order. In
stead of sitting around under heat lamps 
after they are first prepared, hamburgers 
and other sandwiches will be made for 
students on the spot, and other self-ser
vice options, such as pasta and taco bars, 
have been added.
Were making great improvements, 
said Annette Allison, director of contract
ing services for business services. Weve 
made a lot of foods cooked to order, cre
ated a new 6-week cycle menu and given 
vegetarian eaters more options. Weve 
really tried to address the needs of stu
dents by making foods more ethnically 
diverse.
Allison said Eat N Parks famous bak
ery operation will also improve food selec
tion as dining services works to improve 
their bakery and dessert selections. If 
given permission to sell the licensed prod
uct, students may soon be able to buy Eat 
N Parks smiley cookies in the Universitys 
dining halls.

As part of their continuing efforts 
to improve and diversify on-campus 
dining facilities, Dining Services has 
introduced a number of speciality' 
food carts. The major additions, in- . 
eluding a Turkish/Middle-Eastern; 
cart in Baker Hall and a North and; 
South Indian food cart in Building; 
D, were initiated primarily to take 
pressure off the existing carts, Vie 
de France and La Prima, in the lobby 
of Wean Hall.
According to Annette Allison, the 
new Director of Contracted Services 
for Business Services, the Univer
sity is looking to diversify dining 
services by catering directly to the 
many international tastes on cam
pus. To this end, the decisions to 
introduce Middle Eastern and In
dian cuisine as cart options were 
reached as a result of input provided 
by Dean Peter Stearns of H&SS, 
students, and faculty. One aspect of 
campus dining that has improved 
considerably as a result is the the 
options available to vegetarians.
Gourmet Avenue, Bakers new 
cart, provides a menu consisting of 
Turkish recipies developed by a local 
family-owned restaurant business.

Frederick J. Amery, CMU pro
fessor emiritus of print technol
ogy and Fellow of the Royal Soci
ety of Arts in Great Britain, died 
on January 10, of pneumonia. He 
was 87.
Amery taught the discipline of 
printing in Britain from 1931 un
til the outbreak of World War II in 
1939. He then joined the Royal 
Air Force as a volunteer, and went 
on to become a squadron leader in
the National Fire Service. He 
served during the Blitz, put
ting out fires set by German 
bombs.
After winning many awards 
for his typographic skills in 
Great Britain, Amery immi
grated to the United States in 
1948.
He became a professor at 
CIT, teaching students the art 
of traditional typesetting  
setting metal characters and 
hot metal linotype. Amerys 
most modern equipment included a photo-typesetting 
machine, now obsolete.
Amery taught not only the 
art of the craft, but the disci
pline involved as well. He re
quired that students not just 
painstakingly set the ty'pe, but 
that they also return the tiny 
letters to the type case when 
the project was completed.
[Amery] brought British 
standards of politeness and re
spectable conduct to the print 
shop  which wasnt always 
what the American students
were used to, said Edward 
Fisher, a CMU professor emeri
tus of design in a January 13, 
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette article.
After Amerys retirement, the 
Baker Hall wing that then 
housed the print laboratories 
were named in his honor, and 
adorned with a plaque handcarved by one of his students.
Some people are born to 
teach, said his wife Catherine 
in a Pittsburgh Post-Gazette 
He was one of those. She 
was unavailable for further
comment.
Frederick J. Amery is sur
vived by his wife, Catherine, a 
daughter, Alyce Amery-Spencer, and a granddaughter. No 
visitation is to be held, but there 
will be a memorial service next 
Saturday at noon at William 
Slater & Sons Funeral Home, 
Mount Washington.
Memorial contributions 
should be made to the Ronald 
McDonald House in Honolulu. 
The address is 1970 Judd Hill
side Road, Honolulu 96826.

Cold but determined, a couple dozen 
protesters stood outside CFA on Monday, 
January 15 in a protest against CMUs 
failure to recognize Martin Luther King 
Day and SEIs involvement in military 
technological advancement. A banner 
reading CMU Dump the Guns  Fund 
the Future was held u,p during speeches, 
readings, and musical performances which 
took place that afternoon.
After a two year hiatus, Vincent Scotti 
Eirene returned to Carnegie Mellon this
past Monday, to protest against CMU and 
the Software Engineering Institute. The 
protest, advertised to take place at the 
Hewlett Gallery in CFA, interfered with 
CFAs career opportunities events. Chief 
Lapaglia showed up to ask Eirene to move 
outside. After minimal resistance, Eirene 
agreed. We moved outside because they 
asked us to and the students who came 
here are very nervous about facing ar
rest, he said.
Lapaglia seemed more than practiced 
at dealing with Eirene. We [have] ar
rested him at least a half dozen times, he

The music students of Carnegie Mellon will soon have an 
opportunity that few musicians have available to them during 
their lifetimes. They may be one of the students allowed to use a 
Stradivarius violin in a performance.
The violin was recently donated to the string collection at 
Carnegie Mellon. Andres Cardenes, head of the String Program 
at Carnegie Mellon and concertmaster of the Pittsburgh Sym
phony, donated his Stradivarius to the Music Department.

WASHINGTON Jan. 19 (AP)
 She says she wants the truth 
out. The congressional commit
tees say they want her story. 
But in an only-Washingtonworks-this-way tap dance, the 
committees havent asked 
Hillary Rodham Clinton to tes
tify and she hasnt volunteered.
A lot of weighty explanations 
are offered up. Theres prece
dent  no first lady has been 
dragooned (or even subpoe
naed) before Congress. Theres 
the issue of executive privilege
 the right of a presidency to 
keep its secrets. And theres 
Mrs. Clintons status. Shes not 
paid and not a government offi
cial.
But at the bottom line is poli
tics. No one can be sure who 
would come out the winner if 
Mrs. Clinton went before the 
committees investigating 
White-water and the firing of 
White House travel office aides. 
She did well when she testified 
last year as a witness for the 
Clinton health care plan. Re
publicans treated her gently.
But even soft questioning 
could add substance to critics 
charges that shes been lying 
about her knowledge of the fir
ings and the extent of her in
volvement in the Whitewater 
matter.
If I were sitting there, says 
Suzanne Garment, author of a 
book on scandal in Washington, 
I would think a lot about Mrs. 
Clinton and how good she is un
der examination and about how 
if you really want to break some
one like her you would have to 
conduct a real cross-examina
tion which would ran the risk of 
looking like badgering.
She might clean their 
clocks, says Erwin Hargrove, 
a presidential expert on the po
litical science faculty at 
Vanderbilt University. Unless 
they thought she was guilty of 
something and they had her 
dead to rights, I would be loathe 
to call her. Dont forget the old 
defense lawyers rule  dont 
ever call a witness unless you 
know what they have to say.
This weeks bizarre develop
ments might change the equa
tion and compel further involve
ment by one of the Clintons. A 
Clinton aide testified Thurs
day that some of Mrs. Clintons 
long-sought records abruptly 
showed up on a table in the
White House third floor living 
quarters last August. The aide, 
Carolyn Huber, said she put 
them in a box without looking 
at them and rediscovered them 
this month.
And then, newly released 
documents show that Mrs. 
Clinton, as part of routine 
housekeeping at her law firm, 
ordered destroyed in 1988 four 
files from her work on the fail
ing Madison Guaranty Savings 
and Loan now at the heart of 
the Whitewater affair. The first 
lady said she did not initiate 
the destruction.
For Sen. Lauch Faircloth, RN.C the belated discovery of 
Mrs. Clintons records was too 
much.
I think its our duty to find 
out who hid these records dur
ing that period of time  and 
they were hidden, he said.
We have no choice, at the 
very minimum, to depose [ques
tion off camera] the president 
and the first lady on a reason
able assumption of possible ob
struction of justice on this very 
issue, Faircloth said.
Sen. Alfonse DAmato, chair
man of the Senate Whitewater 
Committee, gets edgy about 
subpoenaing the first lady too.
If Mrs. Clinton wants to come 
in, wed be delighted to get her 
information, he said this week.
You wont subpoena her 
though? asked Harry Smith 
on CBS This Morning.
DAmato: No. You know 
what would take place, Harry.
Smith: Tell me."
DAmato: Well, there would 
be charges that were attempt
ing to create a political circus.
But foliowingThursdays tes
timony, DAmato said it may 
prompt him to submit written 
questions to the first lady.
A day earlier, Rep. William 
Clinger, chairman of the House 
Reform and Government Over
sight Committee that is inves
tigating the travel office fir
ings, said his'panel also may 
send Mrs. Clinton some writ
ten questions.
Mrs. Clinton says shell do 
anything to clear the air. But 
she hasnt signed up as a wit
ness. The presidents lawyer, 
Robert Bennett, saidThursday, 
The members of the commit
tee have her phone number and 
her address. I think Ill leave it 
like that.

SALINAS, Calif. Jan. 18 (AP) 
A series of motivational break
fasts at a high school dubbed the 
Hard Work Cafe" has drawn the 
ire of the Hard Rock Cafe, chain, 
which is threatening suit unless 
the students find a new name.
North Salinas High School be
gan serving waffle and sausage 
breakfasts in October to reward 
good grades.
They called their morning 
meals the Hard Work Cafe be
cause that sounded snappy.
Within weeks, though, the 
school received a cease and de
sist letter from lawyers for the 
international restaurant chain, 
claimingtrademarkinfringement 
and threatening suit.
We must insist that the high
school immediately cease its in
fringing activities and notify us 
in writing of its compliance, read 
the letter from Gerry Schekleton 
of Welsh and Katz, Ltd., in Chi
cago, which gave the school 10 
days to reply.
The school cancelled 
plans for a 
second 
breakfast 
in Decem
ber, and wrote the 
law firm explaining 
that the program was 
a motivational tool for stu
dents who completed a success
ful marking period, and no prof
its were involved.
But the Hard Rock would not
budge.
Its a shame, because the teach
ers really loved it, Activities Di
rector Margaret Noroian said.
Schekleton said the school was 
illegally using a knock-off of the 
Hard Rock Cafe logo on Tshirts it 
made for the 
program and 
added that 
the company 
goes after 
anyone who uses two 
out of the three words 
in its name.
There are some people out 
there using (our name) to pro
mote projects that are not in line 
with the family atmosphere of 
Hard Rock Cafe, said Jeff
Wagner, a spokesman at the cor- -
porate headquarters in Los An<
geles.
As much as this one is a good 
cause, if we dont have control 
over it, we run the risk of damagr. 
ing the companys reputation in, 
the public eye. Thats why were,. 
so strict about it, he added.
Meanwhile, the school plans to. 
continue the program, in one form 
or another, with a breakfast when
thismarkingperiodendsonJanu-. 
ary 25 and put together a makeup 
breakfast for those who qualified., 
forthe cancelledDecember break
fast.
Its too bad they didnt get on 
the bandwagon and help it 
along, said agriculture teacher"

Within the next decade, most of 
the worlds Jews will be living in 
Israel, a newspaper reported Fri
day.
The Haaretz daily newspapers 
report gave partial results of a 
World Jewish Congress popula
tion study. The study is to be 
officially released at a conference 
in Jerusalem next week.
According to the report, Israel 
will surpass the United States as 
the country with the worlds larg
est Jewish population.
There are currently 13 million 
Jews in the world, with close to 5 
million in Israel, the report said. 
The United States is home to 5.8 
million Jews, but the number of 
American Jews is shrinking be
cause of assimilation and low 
birth rates.
The report noted that there is 
no country except Israel where 
the Jewish population is growing 
through birth. The increase in 
the number of Jews in Germany 
and Canada is due to immigra
tion, the report said.

WASHINGTON Jan. 18 (AP)
 The Clinton administration 
says it is essential for President 
Boris N. Yeltsin to reaffirm the 
Russian governments commit
ment to economic reform.
State Department spokesman 
Nicholas Bums lauded resigned 
Russian economic specialist 
Anatoly Chubais on Wednesday 
and said that when Prime Minis
ter Viktor S. Chernomyrdin vis
its Washington this month he 
will hear a message from U.S. 
officials that reforms must be 
maintained and that the West 
will continue to support them.
The fact is that theyve made 
tremendous strides in building a 
market economy, Bums said.
The statement followed State 
Department confirmation that 
Chubais, who oversaw Russian 
economic policy and was the most 
ambitiously pro-reform official 
left in Yeltsins Cabinet, had re
signed as first deputy prime min
ister.
As he stepped down, Chubais 
said Yeltsin had been dissatis
fied with his work and that he 
hoped the presidents attitude did 
not reflect concessions to Com
munists.
The Clinton administration re
mains steadfast in its support of 
reform and of Yeltsin.
But Burns said: We think it is 
absolutely essential that Presi
dent Yeltsin and Prime Minister 
Chernomyrdin reaffirm the re
form basis of the Russian govern
ment concerning economic re
form. We think it is very impor
tant that the Russian government 
continue to work productively 
with the International Monetary 
Fund, with the World Bank and 
with the American, the German, 
and other governments who wish 
it well and who are supporting it 
with billions of dollars in inter
national assistance.
On another front, Defense Sec
retary William Perry said Russia 
was justified in responding with 
military force to hostage-taking 
by Chechen rebels.
We reject the right of any group 
to take hostages as a means of 
implementing their policies, 
Perry said. Therefore we believe
the Russian government is en
tirely correct in resisting this 
hostage-taking effort and resist
ing it very strongly.

JOHANNESBURG, South Af
rica Jan. 18 (AP)  If youre feel
ing tired and listless, Dr. William 
Davis might tell you to take two 
pills and bury your head in the 
sand.
Davis and his son, Henry, have 
developed a pill to help you cope 
with stress. Especially if youre 
an ostrich.
Ostriches, it seems, are highstrung even in the calmest of 
times. Ostrich chicks get so 
stressed-out after birth  they 
must walk within hours of hatch
ing and start running a day or 
two later  that disease, cold 
weather, or the threat of preda
tors can easily prove fatal.
But when their water is spiked 
with the Davis supplement, the 
birds burn enough energy to cope 
with the stressand grow faster 
in the process.
Were having a great deal of 
success with it, said rancher 
Gavin Kanigowski, as brown-andblack-speckled babies the size of 
turkeys huddled nearby on his 
farm near Cape Town.
The Davises originally devel
oped their medicine for folks  
yes, folks  who have a little 
trouble getting out of bed each 
morning.
It enhances the bodys ability 
to burn and process fatty depos
its, creating more energy  like 
additives that advertisers claim 
will make your car run more effi
ciently.
Henry Davis, also a doctor fa
miliar with South Africas lucra-,. 
tive ostrich-farming industry,; 
saw the possibility of using it on 
the huge, irritable birds prized 
for their fluffy feathers, supple 
hides and lean meat.
And so Ostra Mag was bom.
Its introduction has been good 
news for the ostrich industry,, 
which slaughters an estimated120,000 mature birds each year 
to produce leather goods, feather, 
wear, andlow-cholesterol steaks;
With competition growing in , 
Europe, the Middle East, China, 
and the United states, South Af; 
rican farmers want to maintain^ 
the advantage honed from three*' 
centuries of experience.
At last science in South Africa 
is developing products for our* 
ostrich industry, Kanigowski^ 
said.
The Davises began offering' 
their creation last year in tw<$ 
forms Ostra Mag as a liquicR 
supplement for ostriches an 
Camesium, which comes as fluids 
orin pills for humans. Otherthanj 
the labeling, there is no differ-;: 
ence.
Every living animal or human.' 
being functions through energy,:! 
said William Davis, 77, who-! 
started studying levels of magne-'. 
sium and carnitine in chronic fa-' 
tigue patients eight years ago. ;
Its the magnesium that makes; 
the energy in the cell, and that-; 
energy in the cell maintains life. .'
His son, 41, said he knew when 
we had this stuff, it was going to j 
work for ostriches.
Ostriches ... rely heavily ontheir fat-burning ability, Henr^; 
Davis said. If they cant burn thefat, that leads to problems.
The only problem so far has 
been the taste, described by Hemy 
Davis as quite horrible.

50 YEARS AGO, January 15, 
1946: The Carnegie Tartan re
ported a somewhat expectable 
turnout at a stag dance held after 
a victorious game against Wash
ington and Jefferson. The men in 
attendance greatly outnumbered 
the women. Some things never 
change.
25 YEARS AGO, January 21, 
1971: Trouble broke out after a 
dance hosted by SPIRIT in the 
ballroom of Skibo, the University 
Centers predecessor. Uninvited 
off-campus persons forced their 
entry to the dance, which was open 
only to SPIRIT members and their 
guests. At the conclusion of the 
dance, a cash box had been stolen 
from the Tartan Grill, a small 
scuffle had been started over 
undelivered marijuana, and an 
attempt to steal a Typewriter from 
the Tartan newspaper office had 
been made. Total damage to Skibo 
was estimated at $250.
Immediately preceding the 
dance, several students and in
nocent bystanders were jumped 
by members of the mob leaving 
campus. Injuries from weapons 
such as a knife and three-foot 
clubs brandished with nails in
cluded puncture wounds and se
rious cuts.
A total of six people were hospi
talized. Campus security re
sponded early on in the evening, 
and called on support from Pitts
burgh police.
10 YEARS AGO, January 21, 
1986: The Pittsburgh center for 
Advanced Computing in Engi
neering and the Sciences is es
tablished. The Mellon-Pitt-Carnegie Corporation announced the 
grant of $40 million for the pur
chase of a supercomputer by the 
National Science Foundation.
The Supercomputer, a top of 
the line Cray X-MP/48, toted a 
handsome price tag of $22 mil
lion. The total project, which in
cluded the addition of 30 research
ers to Mellon institute, was val
ued at over $70 million.
Then CMU President Richard 
Cyert hailed the center as one of 
the most fantastic I have been 
involved with. He credited the 
award of the grant to the joint 
venture between the University 
of Pittsburgh and CMU. I give 
[then Pitt President] Wesley 
Pasovar more credit then I give 
myself, said Cyert.
The Cray was to be housed at 
Westinghouses Monroeville fa
cility, accessible by CMU and Pitt 
researchers via dedicated high 
speed transmission lines.
This was A big day for the city 
of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon, 
the University of Pittsburgh, and
Westinghouse, remarked Pas
ovar. This was one of five grants 
for supercomputing centers made 
nationally, of which Pittsburghs 
was the most advanced.
FIVE YEARS AGO, January,: 
21, 1991: The Tartan reported, 
Senior Vice President Ed Schatzs 
ambitious plans for the comple
tion of the new University Center. We hope to have it open and 
available for students use at the 
beginning of the 1993-94 school 
year, said Schatz.
The University Center is cur
rently expected to open in August 
of 1997; better late than never.

said. Last Mondays incident did not 
require any arrests since Eirene agreed 
% move outdoors. CMU Police had no 
qualms with the protest being held on 
arnpusi We have a policy regarding 
free speech and demonstrations, 
Lapaglia said. As long as protesters dont 
block access to doors, dont interrupt 
university business, and dont destroy 
university property, CMU police will 
ndt interfere with the demonstration.
A leader for the Pittsburgh DMZ (De
militarized Zone), Eirene was arrested 
two years ago for blocking the doors to 
SEX. He also led a thirty day fast outside 
of Wean hall after the Iraqi War because 
ofbeliefs that SEI helped produce tech
nology used for smart bombs in the war.
Terry McGillen, spokesperson for SEI, 
said the claims he [Eirene] makes about 
SEI and the computer department are 
just untrue. McGillen said that SEI
does do work with the military but that 
Eirenes attempts to link SEI to the 
smart bomb technology used in the Iraqi 
war are incorrect.
I think what were hoping to accom
plish today is to make the campus aware 
that there are people in the community 
upset with CMU for not recognizing 
Martin Luther King Day as a holiday, 
Eirene said.
However, students like Charles 
Duncan, a junior at the University of 
Pittsburgh, may disagree with Eirenes 
intentions. Coming along with a num
ber of Pitt students to protest against 
CMU for not recognizing Martin Luther 
King Day, Duncan said, I wasnt very 
clear on what specifically was going on 
here. He and most of the other Pitt 
students left the rally even before it 
began upon learning that the focus was 
SEIs contracts with the military.
According to Eirene, Martin Luther
King Day served as a good catalyst for a 
protest against SEI involvement with 
the military because of Kings political 
opposition to the Vietnam War. Page 
Thomas, a CMU alumni (93 architec
ture), read from Beyond Vietnam, 
Kings 1967 speech against the War, 
delivered at the Riverside Church in 
New York City. I came really to cel
ebrate Martin Luther Kings birthday, 
Thomas said.
Later that evening, Eirene hosted a 
benefit show at the Bloomfield Bridge 
Tavern. Blind Sight, Ploughmans 
Lunch, and ATS played brief sets to help 
raise money for the Duncan and Porter 
House, a hospitality organization that 
helps shelter and feed the homeless. At 
the benefit, more speeches were made in 
favor of Dr. King and peace.
If societys ever going to learn, its 
going to be from people like us, Eirene 
said.
Historic violin donated to string collection

There are approximately 500 
Stradivarius violins in the 
world, ranging in value from 
$500,000 to $3 million. 
Stradivari lived from 1644 to
of the Music Department, 
stressed the importance of the 
instruments future role in the 
Music Department. We do 
have students heading for 
maior careers: something like
ference can be in the quality 
of the sound. It could very 
well launch a students ca
reer. Even if it doesnt, the 
experience of playing such an 
instrument can be verv eduWhenever a student is auditioning for a sym
phony, the instrument becomes very important.  
Marilyn Taft Thomas, Music Department head
-1737, and he built some of the 
worlds most valuable violins. 
The violin that Cardenes do
nated was built in 1717. 
Marilyn Taft Thomas, head
this can be very important, 
said Thomas. Whenever a stu
dent is auditioning for a sym
phony, the instrument becomes 
very important; all of the difcational. The violin will be 
used by the most gifted stu
dents for important auditions 
and performances.
Cardenes wanted to make
the violin available for use by 
more people, so he decided to 
donate the violin to the CMU 
string collection. It [the dona
tion] has been in the works for 
some time on my part. I didnt 
" want it to be a big hoopla, I 
wanted to keep it relatively 
quiet, but something like this 
is hard to keep quiet, said 
Cardenes.
Cardenes has been a pro_ fessor at Carnegie Mellon for 
1 seven years, and has been 
with the Pittsburgh symphony 
for eight years.
Cardenes donated the violin 
in memory of his friend and 
mentor Josef Gingold.

It is really necessary, to get a 
competitive position in the market
place, to bid these contracts in a 
competitive environment, said 
Larry Young, the CMU director of 
work management. You need to do 
a check of the marketplace to make 
sure youre getting the proper 
amount of service for the dollars 
that youre spending.
One of the keys to the change is 
CMUs rating on the Daniels inspec
tion system, a 100-point quality scale.
According to Young, CPS inspected 
the campus and rated it in the 60 
range. He said the hope is that the 
campus can be improved by over 20 
points in the rating.
We would anticipate the campus 
being in the 80-86 range, Young said.
Carter indicated that the CPS con
tract had financial incentives based 
on the ratings, although Young said 
the details had not been finalized.
Were trying to make a 20-point im
provement on a 100-point scale, and its 
going to take time, Carter said. But 
thats the goal. Theres a higher level of 
expectation for CPS [than for ABM]. 
Were interested in getting the cam
pus up to this 80-86 level, Young 
added, so if they [CPS] fail to perform 
to the 8086 level, their compensation 
will be decreased.
Carter said the management 
changeover should not affect employ
ees of Service Employees Interna
tional Union Local 29, saying they 
would be given a chance to work for
CPS.
All of the people who are pres
ently working for ABM, we hope will 
be working for CPS, he said. We 
expect all of the people to be em
ployed by CPS, but we do expect 
them to deploy those people in a dif
ferent fashion than ABM did. 
Auniversity press release said, CPS 
anticipates hiring the current ABM 
cleaning staff after individuals com
plete an application and pass a secu
rity background check. CPS has talked 
with Service Employees International 
Union Local 29 to schedule negotia
tions in order to ensure a smooth tran
sition.
The main personnel changeover will 
be in the management. The current 
managers are ABM direct employees, 
Carter said, and will be reassigned by 
ABM. CPS will bring in its own man
agement team, led by Carol Bush.
Young said CPS is providing more 
than just a new style of custodial ser
vice. CPS is going to provide some 
new equipment, some additional 
chemicals, and whatever the staff 
seems to be lacking, and additional 
oversight and management applied to 
the university  specifically an in
spection program.
There are going to be several 
people whose positions are specifi
cally aimed at monitoring the qual
ity of the work force.
According to the university release, 
One Oxford Center, One Oliver Plaza, 
and USAir are among Central Prop
erty Servicess current customers.

University should 
close for MLK day
Last Monday, many educa
tional, business, and government 
institutions closed down in obser
vance ofMartin Luther KingDay. 
Instead of postponing the com
mencement of a new semester to 
join in the celebration, Carnegie 
Mellon began classes.
The CMU administration gives 
several reasons for this puzzling 
behavior, a major of which is the 
fact that the University celebrates 
no other similar holidays, such as 
Presidents Day.
However, while we acknowledge 
the right that CMU has, as a 
private institution, to not cel
ebrate Martin Luther Kings 
birthday, we question the deci
sion the University has made. 
Carnegie Mellon is, to say the 
least, a leader among the large 
organizations in Pittsburgh. With 
private and public investments 
citywide, CMU is an important 
business leader and an equally 
important factor in Pittsburghs 
economy.
By not closing its doors in obser
vance of this important national 
holiday, CMU sends a negative 
and irresponsible message to the 
rest of the city and its academic 
peers. Although unintentional, 
this message is one of indiffer
ence and coldness to an impor
tant holiday, and the important 
concepts connected to that holi
day.
Many claim that if the Univer
sity were to close its doors on 
Martin Luther King Day, effec
tively extending the winter 
break, that students would sim
ply use the day to travel back to 
Pittsburgh; students would not 
celebrate the ideas for which the 
holiday stands. True as this may 
be, the fact that CMU does not 
close for the day still sends an at 
least questionable message to the 
community.
Although the Universitys ef
forts to celebrate the day through 
speeches, lectures, song, and a 
vigil are laudable, we feel that it 
is simply not enough.
Additionally, the also laudable 
theme that the University has 
embraced to celebrate the holi
day, one of community service, 
does not embody all the ideas 
and passions of Dr. King, Jr.; 
speeches and songs do not do it 
all.
We thank the University for 
taking the steps to celebrate the 
holiday this year, but implore 
the administration, students, 
faculty and staff to inspire the 
campus community to live by the 
dreams of Dr. King every day.
Grade reporting must 
be more efficient
Despite Carnegie Mellons repu
tation as one the countrys most 
technologically advanced schools, 
students continue to find them
selves frustrated with the ineffi
cient process of grade distribu
tion that they are forced to en
dure. As each semester rolls to an 
end, we must restlessly wait out 
the duration of our breaks in 
agony, while our grade. reports 
leisurely make their way through 
the mail. While the Registrar 
claims to send them out by De
cember 28, some students fail to 
receive their grades until the last 
week of their vacation. One stu
dent found it odd that she didnt 
get her grade report until Janu
ary 12 when it only takes one day 
for mail to be sent to Cleveland 
from Pittsburgh. Although in
clement weather did discontinue 
postal service on the Eastern sea
board, grade reports arrived no 
earlier to addresses in other re
gions.
We find it quite ironic that many 
supposedly backward schools 
can manage to deliver grades 
much faster than CMU. Our Uni
versity continues to tout its high 
level of technology in its research, 
academics, and day to day opera
tions. However, one would think 
that the University, as a whole, 
could better utilize such technol
ogy to deliver students QPAs to 
them in a timely, accurate, and 
complete manner.
Currently, the standard grade 
report not only arrives several 
weeks after the conclusion of 
classes, but it lacks important 
information that a summary of a 
students performance should in
clude. In particular, the grade 
report should include, at the very 
least, the students cumulative

QPA  this figure is available 
only through a trip down to The 
HUB. An ideal grade report 
would be an unofficial transcript 
 a document including the 
students academic history at 
CMU. The Registrars Office 
maintains documents like these, 
but they are not used as grade 
reports.
Additionally, using unofficial 
transcripts as grade reports 
would eliminate the need for stu
dents to request audits from 
their departments when prepar
ing to register for classes. This 
process can take up to a week, 
and only creates extra red tape 
for departmental offices.
At the conclusion of a semes
ter, students tend to pour their 
maximum efforts on whatever 
obstacles seem to determine their 
final grades. Be it a final exam, 
project, or paper, students rarely 
get immediate feedback on their 
efforts. For that reason, we think 
it should be possible for students 
to access their courses grades 
before grade reports are mailed; 
students should have more im
mediate access to course results 
via telephone, world-wide web, 
or email. Although security risks 
exist with such practices, there 
are practical, applicable protec
tive measures that can be taken 
to ensure confidentiality. For 
example, a mass email could be 
sent with all grades for an entire 
class or section, coded by social 
security number or by randomly 
designated student numbers.
The bottom line remains that 
students deserve more complete 
and efficient access to their grade. 
Considering the current state of 
communication technology, this 
should not be too much to ask.
Editor: & K
First of all I want 
to commend Lauren 
Heinz and the entire L0tt6T tO 
staff of The Tartan 
for the wonderful job 
that they have done 
this year. Every Monday I look forward 
to picking up an issue of this highly 
informative and entertaining newspa
per. The December 4,1995 issue was no 
exception. I was having an enjoyable 
read until I turned to page 6 and read 
James Stepaneks Minorities Rise With
out Govt Monies.
My first reaction was Who is this 
guy? After reading the article twice, I 
realized how happy I was that Mr. 
Stepanek had written the column. It put 
into perspective that at Carnegie Mellon, 
a school where the majority of the com
munity is supposed to be very openminded and accepting to all sorts of 
ideas, closed minds are not as rare as 
perceived.
James Stepanek helped to show me 
this with the words that he wrote in his 
column. After reading his intro about 
minorities always using racism as an 
excuse for their problems, one of the first 
quotes that struck me was they [minor
ity leaders] always lay the blame at the 
doorstep of another, and never accept 
any of it themselves.
Yes, it is true that some minorities do 
use racism as an excuse, justified or not. 
However, the majority of us do not. We 
are willing to take the blame and the 
responsibility for the problems in our 
communities (i.e. drugs, poverty, high
dropout rates). The majority of minority 
communities have strong PTAs, avid 
community patrols to try to stop the war 
on drugs and, most importantly, a strong 
sense of pride. This holds true even in 
the black and hispanic communities of 
Los Angeles County, where to outsiders 
it seems that there is no hope.
When you hear of community leaders 
complaining, not blaming, they are call
ing out for the government to come and 
aid them in their fight. They seek allies. 
If the leaders of my community sat on 
their behinds and waited for help, the 
neighborhood would not be as thriving 
as it is today.
The idea of not waiting but getting 
involved, ASAP, was the main concept 
behind the Million Man March on Wash
ington. While Mr. Stapanek bashed Min
ister Louis Farrakahn for being a racist, 
Minister Farrakahn was trying to pro
mote leadership within black commu
nities. He preached that you should not 
wait for the white mans (a term I 
disagree with) help. I am not an avid fan 
of Farrakahn, but he is taking steps 
towards doing some of the things that 
Mr. Stepanek accused minority commu
nities of not doing.
I could go on and on about this article.
I could talk about how he tries to com
pare the Asian experience in America 
with the black experience. I would never 
compare slavery to the holocaust. They 
were both"two horrible events in history, 
and both groups involved emerged very 
differently. So why compare black and 
Asian experiences? I could write about 
how he talks about welfare and the mi
nority experience. Not once does he men
tion that there are more white people on 
welfare than any other group. Even so, 
he never once mentions how the major
ity of people on welfare do not abuse the 
system. It is only a small number of 
cases that get the most attention. I wont 
even comment on his ideas about mi
norities not being the sons and daugh
ters of shopkeepers who are now engi
neers, doctors, and scientists which en
able a high-tech nation to prosper.
It is these comments, along with very 
poor coverage of the mentioned issues, 
that lead me to have a problem with the 
column. It is okay to have a personal 
opinion about a group of people. We live 
in America, the land of the free. As a 
writer for a student newspaper, though, 
it is not okay to generalize about that 
group or to write about just one side of 
an issue. Not only is it not good journal
ism, but ignorance.
No opinions are wrong, but some are 
better than others. A better opinion con
sists of having better support for your 
argument. Mr. Stepanek just does not 
have the support. I doubt that Mr. 1 
Stepanek has ever spent a great deal of 
time in a minority community. It is obvi
ous that he did not even try to do the ; 
research for this article by talking to 
someone who has.
I have been on both sides of the tracks, 
having lived in both predominantly black 
and white communities. I would say I 
from my experience that the things Mr. 
Stepanek wrote were off base. I would be | 
willing to respect this article and his 
opinion 100% if he had done a more I 
thorough job. I am not disagreeing with 
everything he wrote, but I would have 
rather read a humorous article about 
wiping my ass with thin toilet paper.

Social Security fails younger generation
James Stepanek
Social Security is. 
often hailed as one 
of the great accom
plishments of 
FDRs administra

the primary means
of retirement by millions of people and is viewed as a sacred 
right, untouchable in budget battles. It is also a really lousy 
idea which makes no economic sense and will likely break 
the fiscal back of our government.
When Social Security was started, it was designed as a 
form of retirement insurance. The idea was that working 
age people were taxed and are later repaid in retirement 
(begining at age 65) with a steady monthly income. It was 
fiscally feasable when created because there ;was an ex
panding population of wage earners and life expectancies 
were lower than the age at which payments began.
In order for the system to work, as with any type of 
insurance, it needs more people putting money in the pot 
than taking out.
So, whats the problem?
Well, today the average life expectancy is around sev
enty-five years. When the program began, it was about 
sixty years. This means theres a much greater likelihood 
that people will collect their monthly checks. Also, the 
ratio of workers to retirees has been dropping steadily 
since the new deal. With a relatively static: population 
growth rate, the system becomes unsustainable. As people 
live longer, and the population ages, the tax burden on each 
wage earner simply must increase or Social Security will go 
under.
Our concern should be on how much the system can bear. 
Can anyone imagine an auto insurance company surviving 
if half the policy holders all wrecked their cars at once?
What if that company also encouraged people to drive on 
icy roads, and didnt make any assessments of policy costs 
dependent on whether or not a person was involved in a lot 
of accidents?
Obviously, this company would go under very quickly. 
However, the government runs social security like the bad 
insurance company just described. The government man
dates that you put in money regardless of your likelihood 
of retirement (should smokers who die young pay as much 
into the fund?). The government even has scores of pro
grams aimed at lengthening lives. This is rather at cross 
purposes to the viability of this retirement program 
Of course there will be those who will say Im advocating 
that the government shorten lifespans, but thats simply 
what Social Security requires to be viable. Im certainly not 
in favor of the system.
Like an insurance company, the government must find a 
way to make the system work. This means make retire
ment payout less likely, such as by raising the age of 
retirement. This was done in the eighties under the Reagan
administration as a stop-gap measure to preserve the fiscal 
vaibility of the program.
It isnt enough, however, due to the shift in population 
demographics. Once the baby boomers retire, were going to 
hit an icy patch of road and we wont have ABS or snow 
tires. So what can the average college student expect?
Well, much higher Social Security taxes of course, as well 
as a later date to collect benefits. In other words, youre 
going to kick in more to get less. Sounds about par for the 
course in government programs. They may also simply cut 
off anyone above a certain income level.
Thus the program will simply become welfare for the old. 
There are quite a few people who have advocated this 
stance already. Ross Perot had this as part of his 1992 
campaign. The whole program would lose any semblance of 
being a program for everyone. Most politicians, however, 
are quite afraid for advocate this simply because people 
really hate to give up entitlements.
This is even an optimistic assessment. There is a good 
chance the system will go under. You will be putting 
thousands into the system and never see a penny. Ill give 
you a good piece of advice  get an IRA. You will need it.
Also, in case you dont know, if Social Security goes down, 
the consequences would be quite severe. Its not really 
known commonly, but a large portion of the national debt 
-is owed to the Social Security trust fund.
Whats the solution? As with most everything, get the 
government out of the business. At present were forcing 
people to provide for their retirement in a grossly inefficient 
manner.
If you dropped the money you pay in Social Security taxes 
into a mutual fund, youd have millions of dollars on 
retirement. Instead you get paid out a few thousand a year 
until you die, with nothing to leave to your heirs.
If your counter-argument is that people cant manage 
their money and must be forced into setting money aside for 
retirement, the solution is to pass a law that allows people 
to choose how to invest their money, but still makes them 
do it.
If you think that people need to be protected from bad 
investments, limit the level of risk, with a certain amount 
designated for low risk investments. Say, for example, that 
there would be a requirement of keeping half of the money 
in government bonds.
While this concept that people must be coerced into doing 
things which are to their own advantage, is rather repug
nant, it is still better than supporting a system which is not 
only morally bankrupt because of chronic waste and sys
temic inefficiency, but approching fiscal bankruptcy as 
well.

Jon Orris
Ive stated before that one of the biggest 
bogeymen for environmentalists was the 
use of chemical compounds that enter the 
environment. I discussed in a previous 
article the case of DDT. Well, theres an
other class of chemical compounds which 
are rivaling DDT for its position as the 
most falsely maligned chemical in history. 
That class of compounds is the CFCs, or 
chlorofluorocarbons. CFCs are stable com
pounds that are used in a variety of indus
trial applications, the most famous of which 
is refrigeration utilizing Freon, which has 
vastly improved human life in numerous 
ways.
Since CFCs are so stable and long lived, 
environmentalists fear that CFCs will find 
their way into the stratosphere. Once there, 
ultraviolet sunlight breaks down CFC com
pounds, freeing ionizing chlorine mol
ecules. Chlorine is very destructive to 
ozone, and thus environmentalists fear 
that CFCs will contribute to massive dam
age of the ozone layer, which shields the 
earth from dangerous levels of ultraviolet 
radiation. If the ozone layer is damaged, 
they say, incidence of malignant melano
mas will skyrocket, and crops and live
stock will be negatively affected.
There are two questions that need to be 
answered. One: what will happen if the 
environmentalists worst case fears come 
into fruition, and two: what evidence is 
there that there is actually any massive 
destruction of the ozone layer going on?
The answer to the first question is: not 
much.
After extensive studies, it has been cal
culated that if CFCs were in use at peak 
unregulated levels for 75 to 100 years, the 
ozone level would reach an equilibrium of 
between 5% -10% lower than it is now.
The increase in UV solar radiation would 
be equivalent to moving about 50 to 100 
miles south. Thats it. Thats the big scare, 
the worst-case scenario.
Glancing at a map, I see that the dis
tance from Pittsburgh, to Tampa, Florida, 
where I grew up, is roughly 850 miles. For 
some reason, Im not terribly worried about 
this particular ecological nightmare.
As to the second question, there is no 
evidence whatsoever that long term global 
levels of ozone are declining, that UV lev
els are increasing, or that CFCs can possi
bly cause any of this to happen.
Contrary to popular image, the ozone 
layer is not some static thing. It is being 
continuously broken down in the strato
sphere by UV radiation, and continuously 
replenished by UV radiation acting on 
oxygen. The concern is that CFCs will 
somehow disastrously disrupt this bal
ance.
There is no evidence that CFCs are ca
pable of disrupting the ozone level under 
normal conditions. Government scientists 
and environmentalists have been quick to 
point out fluctuations and drops in the 
ozone level, but there is no evidence that 
these are anything but normal fluctua
tions due to natural processes such as 
temperature, wind conditions, or sunspot 
activity. Worse, isome government scien
tists and environmentalists have done such 
things as taking years with extraordinar
ily high levels of ozone as the base against 
to measure present ozone levels.
As for the actual effect of CFCs, Dr.
Linwood Callis of NASA, who was in charge 
of ozone fluctuation research in the 1980s, 
reported the effect of CFCs on ozone level 
fluctuations to be on the order of one half of 
one percent (Callis, Journal of Geophysical 
Research, Vol. 96, #D2, Feb. 20,1991.) Other 
scientific studies have shown that the levels 
of UV radiation are actually constant or 
declining (Scotto et al., Science, Vol. 239.)
As for the ozone hole/ it is really just a 
thinning of the ozone layer. While it has 
gotten so much attention world-wide, it is a 
purely Antarctic phenomenon.
The annual production of this hole takes 
place during the Antarctic winter. At this 
time, several months of darkness combined 
with whirlpool like weather conditions over 
the area prevent the entrance of UV radia
tion.
The lack of UV radiation means that no 
ozone is being produced, and the whirlpool 
keeps outside air from mixing in and diluting 
the concentrations of chlorine.
When the sun begins to shine again, UV 
radiation breaks down CFCs in the atmo
sphere, releasing more chlorine ions that 
further deplete the ozone level and contrib
ute to the hole5 effect.
In a few weeks, the whirlpool breaks up, 
sunlight produces new ozone, and things go 
back to normal. And in case you were worried 
about all the poor pelicans getting sunburns, 
since its winter at this time, the level of UV 
radiation, even with the hole, is less than 
that during Antarctic su
mmers.
These facts have not stopped environmen
talists from creating hysteria. In 1992, NASA 
scientists predicted that a significant ozone 
hole could occur in the arctic and even over 
parts of the United States. Congress imme
diately voted to accelerate the already in
sane phase-out of CFCs. The fact that NASA 
turned out to be dead wrong in their predic
tions didnt have as much of an effect. As it 
stands now, most forms of CFCs have been 
phased out by now, and all production of 
CFCs and related products will cease by the 
year 2000. Reserves will be used up soon, and 
as of yet there are no adequate substitutes.
Increasingly restrictive taxation schemes 
in the US to encourage phase out have made 
Freon smuggling a highly profitable ven
ture. The cost of replacement of all air-condi
tioning systems alone will be many billions 
of dollars.
Given the utter lack of any rational, objec
tive evidence that the ozone layer is in any 
danger, one might wonder about all the hys
teria. Why is it that a harmless, enormously 
beneficial class of chemicals is being denied 
to the world? The superficial answer is: un
earned prestige for unscrupulous scientists, 
and power for various bureaucrats, politi
cians, and activists.
The deeper answer is more philosophical. 
Environmentalists, in the CFC issue and 
many others, show little concern for actual 
human benefit, but a desire to restrict growth, 
industry, and capitalism.
They would have us return to some com
munal ecological paradise, where we all live 
closer to the earth. The roots of this desire, as 
I have said before, are a hatred of achieve
ment, freedom, production, and thus, of a 
human form of life.
Unable to achieve anything worthwhile in 
their own lives, they burn with the desire to 
tear down everyone elses. If they remain 
unchecked, if we keep electing compromis
ing politicians, if we continue to disallow any 
rational considerations of the facts into envi
ronmental concerns, they will succeed in 
destroying so

- Many issues that arise in modern life deal 
with possible calamities that will cripple 
mankinds prosperity in the future. Whether 
it be an environmental calamity or a ravaging 
.virus, this new form offuture-fear is quickly 
, spreading.
_ While our parents cowered from a threaten. .ingnuclear apocalypse and the dark shadow of 
-the emerging scientific age, todays genera
tion faces collapsing government, deadly 
-lifestyles, and the dangers of an economic 
failure.
If, by chance, a solitary individual manages 
to escape from these worries, that person could 
easily be mugged, beaten, raped, and killed in 
broad daylight in front of their own house.
To make matters worse, our insufficient and 
often overly inefficient police and legal sys
tems will probably manage to enforce even 
less comprehensive justice with each passing 
year.
I am not saying that people arent trying to 
solve these problems. Steps are being taken, 
but not enough to hold back the flood waters. 
All of these problems, as numerous and varied 
as they are, do have one thing in common. Let 
me illustrate with an example: In October of 
1994, an 11-year-old boy dangled a five-yearold boy out the window of a 14th floor. Al
though this five-year-olds older brother (who 
was only eight) tried to save him, thell-yearold dropped him, and let this five-year-old
plunge to his death.
What type of world has turned eight and 
11-year-old boys into heros and monsters?
How many other children become victims 
to their playmates who dont know the dan
gers of the hate theyre mimicking?
What does this say about the future of our 
society?
Even with the entire world engaged in 
brutal war, our grandparents had hope for 
the future. Even with atomic bombs hanging 
over their heads, our parents worked and 
struggled out of hope for their kids. They 
were able to bring up a healthy family with
out fear of losing a child to the maddness of 
the age. But where is the hope now?
Can there be hope for a child with such 
flagrant disregard of life as to drop an inno
cent five-year-old out of a building?
Is there hope for a city whose people are 
afriad to venture outside once the sun has 
gone down?
Is there hope for a society that threatens to 
tear itself up from the inside, and everyone 
knows it?
What has happened to the values and 
respect which once acted as the social glue in 
society?
This is where the issue lies: the decay of 
morality. In our media-driven culture, mor
als are told in the foolish parables of sitcoms 
and newscasters.
Society has sold out to the lowest common 
denominator. Cheap and easy are the new 
virtues; quality and respect have become 
outdated practices.
Answers now come in the form of ninemillimeter bullets, available to all ages. In
tellectual substance has been taken over by
sensationalized sex and violence. Dodging 
responsibilty is more impressive than pride 
in ones work. While disease is a modern 
danger, but a killer virus would at least be 
honest: it does not attempt to mask its inten
tions. But if you take your chances with the 
guy next door, he might invite you inside 
and eat you.
If reforms are not undertaken soon, man
kind may not have a future. These deeper 
issues are not something which may be ig
nored. Values need to be re-instilled, love 
needs to be brought back.
As long as children flock to their gangs 
more then they flock to their parents and 
remain constantly inundated with advertis
ing and media overflow, people will never be 
safe from themselves. Even if the icecaps are 
held at bay, the economy is repaired and 
disease eliminated, the future of our society 
must repair itself. Children must be taught 
to, not taught at. Young men and women 
must be made to understand the core values 
that make up our modern world and those 
that held together the world of our grand
parents and great-grandparents.
People, in order to survive, must learn 
their rights from wrongs: dropping five-yearolds (or any age for that matter) is not a good 
thing to do. There were no morals in that 
boys life, no sense of truth or love.
Only proper values and a sense of respect 
could have kept thay boy from falling. May 
his unfortunate death serve as a reminder to 
us all of the peril we face.

Fencing team takes tourney
By PAUL BOOTHE
Tartan Sports Editor
The CMU Fencing Team kicked off its winter 
.'break to a great start. During the final week of 
school, the team held its annual CMU Collegiate 
."Open and crushed every team who crossed its 
path. Even though the other schools attending 
the competition  Indiana University of Penn
sylvania, Kent State University, Lehigh Uni
versity, and West Virginia University  were 
all fierce competitors, the Tartan squad sliced 
through them all to win the mens foil event. The 
mens team also took third in the foil and sabre 
| events, and the womens team was awarded first 
place in the foil event.
The mens foil team of club president, senior 
Randy Bruno, junior Thibaut de Barros Conti, 
and senior Anantachoke Zen Osangthamanont, 
dominated IUPs A-team 45-4 in a semi-final 
match, and then rolled over Kent State 4520 to 
take first place.
The teams third-place finish in the foil event 
! was an accomplishment in itself. The beginners 
squad of freshmen Matt Geyer, Andrew Mihal, 
Jason Rennie, and William Ross, trounced the 
j IUP B-team and was only just edged out by the 
| IUP A-team, 45-42.
Freshman Michael Lee, doctoral student 
Michael Patterson, and sophomore Michael 
i Sherman took third place in the sabre event. The 
 team lost only one of their first four matches in 
'the opening round-robin, and were later de feated by WVU, who went on to claim first.
The womens foil team won by default, as the 
j womens team from WVU, 'their only competi; tion, did not show. The women were awarded 
j first in their division, and competed against the 
j mens teams. The womens captain, sophomore 
Tomoko Sano, said that she was happy with the 
1 teams performance.
There are three different fencing events  
foil, epee, and sabre. Foil and epee are fairly 
, similar. In both events, points are scored only on 
' thrusts with the point of the weapon within a 
! specific target zone. In foil; score is heavily 
S dependent on the action of the event, while the
scoring in epee is given to whoever touches first. 
Sabre is the most recent of the styles, and includes 
slashing motions with the weapon to the torso and 
above.

Bruno traveled to the Olympic Trials in Chicago 
on January 13. He said, The Olympic Trials... were 
the best tournament Ive ever been to in size and 
quality. Other team members had been scheduled 
to attend the Trials, but poor weather kept them 
from going. Bruno says no one on the team is train
ing for the Olympics, rather they attend the Trials 
for the training and experience that such a competi
tion has to offer.
Bruno said, A lot of us are training to compete 
against other colleges and to compete at nationals. 
He said that they stand to do extremely well at 
nationals, due greatly to the training from their 
coach, Eva Marintcheza, former coach of the Bulgar
ian National Team and trainer for national and 
world competitions for over 20 years.
The Tartan fencers look forward to the team quali
fiers on February 10. The team took second last year, 
and only lost to-the first place team after a long and 
close match. Bruno said, I have high expectations 
for what we can do in February. Also, the team will 
be gearing up for its other annual home tournament, 
the Holy Grail Championship held in March.
Womens track places in invitational
By RICK SIMMONS
 Tartan Staffwriter
i Saturday, four women and five 
1 men from Carnegie Mellons inUoor track team traveled to Rob
ert Morris College in Moon To wn; ship, PA, to compete in an invitaj tional that womens coach Dario 
j Donatelli considered the great - 
I est meet in which the team has 
. competed. It certainly was, as the 
Tartans matched up' against five 
I Division I schools, including
WVU, Pitt, and Virginia Tech, 
and three Division III schools, 
including Kent State.
For the women, the best per
formance of the meet, according 
to Donatelli, was turned in by 
Melissa Baustert.
She won the 800-meter run with 
a time of 2:15 and qualified for 
the national championships in 
doing so. Two other excellent fin
ishes were achieved by Melissa 
Lott and Becky Buchheit, who 
finished second and third, respec
tively,' in the 5,000-meter run. 
Lott ran an 18:54, and Buchheit 
ran a 19:02.
None of the men placed in the 
top six in their events, but there 
is no shame in that, Donatelli 
explained, because of the diffi
culty of performing such a task.
Donatelli, mens coach Gary 
Meckley, and both track teams 
look forward to their next meet, 
which will be a 10 to 12 team 
invitational held at Slippery Rock

Kupfer to secure the win. Summerville led the 
scoring with 16 points, while Kupfer had eight.
The team closed out 95 splitting a pair of matches 
at the Wittenberg College Tournament on Decem
ber 28-29. The Tartans lost the first-round match 
to Wittenberg 85-56. In the game, Summerville 
had 20 points, and OLeary had 15 points. In the 
consolation game, CMU beat Centre 66-60. The 
womens squad held a comfortable 44-24 lead 
going into the second half, but Centre surged to 
try to take the game. The team held the win, 
helped by Kupfers 14 rebounds and Gaitens four 
three-pointers.
Before the Wittenberg Tournament, the team 
participated in the Manchester College Tournament. In the opening game, the Tartans lost to 
Manchester 91-81, despite strong showings by 
junior forward Rebecca McCadney with 21 points, 
Kupfer with 15 points, and sophomore gti<jl 
Marcelle Steele with 13 points.
CMU also dropped the consolation gamS-to 
Alma, 81-56. Gaitens led the Tartan scoring ef
fort, with her five three-pointers comprising the 
bulk of her 17 points, and OLeary contributed 
another 10 points.

to Sullivan and Maddalena. De
spite the lack of rebounds, CMU 
was still outshooting their oppo
nents 3:1.
Buck sat out the third period 
to tend to a turned ankle from a 
hit earlier in the game. Players 
started to get chippy as the refs 
called loosely, for lack of time. 
But the third was ultimately cut 
short by 10 minutes. The 
Edinboro squad had rallied with
two unanswered goals'by the

mentum and aggression from 
both teams was heating to a boil
ing point, the refs were forced to 
call the game.
Neither team was satisfied 
with Carnegie Mellons 4-3 win. 
Kliegman skated away shaking 
his head at the twelve saves he 
had made. The players mumbled 
to each other, When are we go

The old-timers clearly held the 
spotlight during this All-Star 
weekend in Boston. From Friday 
nights Legends game to the final 
seconds of the 46th All-Star 
Game, the veterans proved they 
can, still shine. This competition 
was even sweeter considering the 
two-year wait due to last years 
lock-out-shortened season.
In the first event of this 
weekends festivities, the veteran 
Briiins faced off against old-tim
ers from the rest of the NHL in 
the Legends game.
With a top shelf wrist shot, 
Lanny McDonald proved he could 
still1 teach Theo Fleury and Gary 
Egberts how to lead the Flames 
to-the Stanley Cup. The game 
ended in a 5-5 tie with the Bruins 
shooting to tie the game in the 
final minutes.
It was a pleasure to see Phil 
Esposito and Denis Potvin, play
ers who were in the All-Stars 
when I first began following 
hockey, take the ice once again. 
However, being nostalgic, I feel it 
was.a disgrace for Bruins greats 
likeJGerry Cheevers and Brad 
Park to have to play in the new 
Fleet Center, which replaced the 
hallowed Boston Gardens this 
year.
'In the skills competition, 17- 
year veteran Mike Gartner of 
Toronto captured the win in the 
fastest skater competition. 
Gartner has won this skill seg
ment three out of the six times 
the NHL has had it.
.The biggest upset of the night 
c&iir from Mark Messier of the 
Rangers, who, with 16 seasons 
under his belt, won the most ac
curate shot battle by hitting four 
targets with four shots, a feat 
only accomplished previously by 
t|ie hometown demi-god Ray 
Bourque.
' Bourque shot four out of seven 
this year.
 At the skills competitions end 
the Western Conference defeated 
the Eastern by one point thanks 
to Chicagos Ed Belfour.
; After allowing the East to tie in 
the breakaway competition on 
Islander Mathieu Schneiders 
goal (which was probably the staya<t-home defensemans first 
breakaway outside of warm-ups), 
Belfour defeated the NHLs lead
ing, scorers, Jaromir Jagr and 
Mario Lemieux.
; The two-year wait to see great 
combinations like Wayne Gretzky 
and Brett Hull ended Saturday 
night with the faceoff of the NHLs 
46th All-Star game.
The Eastern Conference 
jumped out to a 3-0 lead with 
gals from Philadelphias Eric 
Lindros, Ranger Pat Verbeek, and 
Pittsburghs own Jagr in the first 
period.
: ! After being shut out by defend
ing New Jersey stopper Martin 
Brodeur, the West finally got on 
the board thanks to a Hull goal. 
The East answered with a goal 
from Hartfords Brendan 
Shanahan, but the West came 
back with Detroits Paul Coffey 
and Anaheims Mickey Mouse 
player Paul Kariya, bringing the 
West within one goal.
;Goffey tied Hall-of-Famer and 
current L.A. coach Larry 
Robinson for most points by a 
defenseman throughout their AllStar career with this goal and an 
earlier assist.
. Only down by one in the final 
period, the West finally knotted 
the score at four apiece on an 
unassisted goal by Winnipegs 
Teemu Selanne.
It looked as if the All-Star game 
was going to overtime but the 
Eastern captain Bourque further 
Endeared himself to Boston by 
sneaking behind Gretzky to back
hand a rebound by Torontos Felix 
Potvin with a mere 38 seconds 
remaining. That shot was enough
kHR 97aumw9e UrIn ea90I10yu1s R9g9,weE VuuGpI1se
From the Point
by Jason Andracki
to earn the hometown hero the 
games MVP. Bourque is the first 
defenseman to carry home the 
MVP trophy since 1972, when 
who else but the legendary Bobby 
Orr won it.
Now the only thing Bourque 
has to do to surpass Orr in the 
hearts of Boston fans is to re
claim the Stanley Cup.
The NHL should be commended 
for organizing such a spectacular 
event. For the first time in years, 
the quality of the players chosen 
merited an All-Star performance.
Commissioner Gary Bettman 
specifically should be praised for 
his decision to add Pittsburghs 
Ron Francis and Torontos Mike 
Gartner to the roster since the
fan balloting results in a popu
larity contest in which Pavel Bure 
can still get thousands of votes 
even though his season was ended 
by an injury in November, while 
underrated superstars are over
looked.
Although that was brilliant, 
replacing Vancouvers Bure with 
Paul Kariya was a grave error.
The winger with the third high
est amount of votes should have 
been chosen, St. Louis captain 
Shayne Corson.
Regardless, the NHL All-Star 
festivities were the highlight of 
this season so far, especially since 
it featured the only meeting for 
this year of superstars Lemieux 
and Gretzky. After one game the
score is Lemieux one, Gretzky' 
zero.
Jason Andracki is a junior pro-1Lfessional writing major. He had,M! 
tickets to the All-Star game but.'- 
refused to attend since Boston L 
Gardens was torn down. Stay'T 
tuned for more words of NHL 
wisdom next week.
Dexters not his usual self. 
You suspect the salsa. 
So you call Dr. Nusblcitt, your family vet back home.
The call s cheap.

Columnists butt heads over Superbowl XXX
Go Steelers!
by Ronak Singhal
For the last decade, we have watched NFC teams 
come to the Superbowl and dominate their AFC 
opposition. Now the Dallas Cowboys have the op
portunity to win their fifth Superbowl, while the 
Pittsburgh Steelers have been offered by the AFC 
as the sacrificial lamb for this year. The Cowboys 
have just about declared victory already, while the 
ibookies in Las Vegas have made them an almost 
two-touchdown favorite. So, the main feature at 
this years game figures to once again be the inno
vative ads that are broadcast, right?
Wrong. Because for all the hype and bluster of 
the Dallas Cowboys, the Pittsburgh Steelers offer 
the best hope for an AFC victory in this game in the 
last five years.
The Steelers are a team built on a solid (if not 
always spectacular) offense, with a very solid (and 
sometimes spectacular) defense. The Cowboys are 
not an invincible team  just look at their two 
_ Josses this season to the lowly Washington Redskins 
1  while the Steelers are on an incredible hot 
streak. They won eight of their last nine regular 
season games. But to beat the Cowboys, the Steelers 
will clearly have to play their best game of the year.
How can Pittsburgh beat Dallas? By returning to 
the fundamentals that got them this far. Control 
the ball for as long as possible and wear down the 
other defense without turning the ball over.
The Steelers offense dominated time of possessionin almost every game this season, and by doing 
so, wore down the opposing defenses, leaving them 
withered when the fourth quarter rolled around. 
By this time, the Steelers can rely on Bam Morris, 
their battering ram of a running back, to hopefully 
put the game away.
Of course if they get behind early, they will have 
to pass, which is not a problem for this team. 
Quarterback Neil ODonnell is having the best 
'year of a Pittsburgh QB since Terry Bradshaw 
back in the glory days, while Yancey Thigpen, 
Ernie Mills, and Andre Hastings comprise what 
may be the deepest group of wide receivers in the 
NFL. And this does not even count Pittsburghs 
Mr. Everything, Kordell Stewart, who can beat you
running, passing, or receiving. The Cowboys de
fense is strong, but they will have problems match
ing up with the versatile Steeler offense, which has 
proven multiple times this season that they have 
the capability to come back late in the game.
But even more important for the Steelers will be 
their defensive play and their ability to contain the 
terrific threesome of Smith, Irvin, and Aikman. 
The Steelers expect to have Rod Woodson back and 
he figures to see some time playing in their dime 
defense, but his inspiration in just playing should 
be a big lift right off the bat.
The Steelers are one of few teams in the league to 
use a 3-4 defense, a defense that the Cowboys have 
not faced all season. The strength of the defense 
are these front 
seven, featur
ing an incred
ibly underrated 
defensive line 
anchored by 
Ray Seals, and 
a spectacular 
linebacking 
corps featuring 
the familiar 
names of 
Greene, Brown,
Kirkland, and 
Lloyd.
In addition, 
the ability of 
the front seven 
to pressure 
Aikman will be 
extremely imJ 
portant be
cause if he is given time to pass, the Steeler second
ary may not be strong enough to hold its own 
against the Cowboy receivers.
If the game is close, as I expect it to be, it could 
come down to a game between the kickers, and 
while Chris Boniol of Dallas had a fantastic season, 
he has not faced the pressure that veteran Norm 
Johnson (who kicked two game-winning FGs this 
season) of the Steelers has.
So, in the overall analysis of the game, why will 
the Steelers win? Theyll do the one thing that has 
never failed to produce victory: Score more points 
than their opponents.

Pittsburgh. Its a pretty town. Steeped in history

American found nowhere else in this country. And 
still, despite all that it has going for it, I cannot help 
but feel only pity for this city, because one thing it 
wont have, come January 28L is a Superbowl Cham
pion. That distinction, my friends, will go to Big D,
Dallas, Texas.

have done this 
nfwa KhgRhgahu rowuUoo shuhUg several times 
this season by using a lethal combination of size, 
strength, and speed to beat their opponents into 
submission. By the time the middle of the third 
quarter rolls around, there is a palpable fatigue 
hanging over the defensive line that even TV view
ers can feel. Ray Seals and his fellow Pittsburgh 
defensive linemen have been very effective so far, 
and though they will undoubtedly cause the Dallas 
line some annoyance, they will lose the vast major
ity of the battles over the line of scrimmage. Thats 
when the familiar story will play itself out  
Emmitt Smith will start gaining five or more yards 
per carry up the middle behind Newton, Moose 
Johnston and Co. Pittburghs talented lineback
ers, Lloyd, Greene, Brown and Kirkland, will have
0u1eerMr9w
to respond by concentrating on the run, allowingAikman to improve his post-season QB rating with ' 
the aid of Irvin, Williams, Novacek, and Sanders??
The competition between the Pittsburgh offegg.,v; 
and Dallas defense may be a little tighter. Dallas5 i 
secondary, despite the talents of corners NdfahJ>! 
Deion and Larry Brown, and safeties Brock Manon.$ 
and Darren Woodson, has been a little too porous. ' 
The Steelers, perhaps on the back of a good run
ning game, have really opened up the skies re
cently. ODonnell has a number of very reliable 
targets in Yancy Thigpen, Ernie Mills, and Andre " 
Hastings. In addition, Pittsburghs offense ntiiv 
has tremendous versatility afforded by the un^re?: ^ 
dictable Kordell Slash Stewart.
The problem for the Steelers is that ODonneU f, 
may not have the time to establish a credible 
passing game until its far too late. The Dallas ; 
defensive line will close the skies with the talents 0 
of Leon Lett, Chad Hennings, Shante Carver, and ( 
probably even Mr. Charles Bring me a QB and 
roast boar on a plate with some mint jelly Haley. 
As a result, Pittsburgh may well have to rely 
heavily on the running game and here, the Steelfers v 
actually have a problemtwo good running backs-; 
instead of one great one. " 0
Though Bam Morris is a very powerful back>: , 
especially effective in short-yardage situations,'lie 
doesnt have the speed or agility to break for long- , 
runs. Eric Peagram, on the other hand, is faster blit' P 
not as strong. In addition, neither back is running ; , 
behind the kind of offensive line that punches holes:,* 
for Emmitt Smith.
Superbowl XXX could well be a close game,.,, 
which would come as a great relief to a jaded ., 
football audience, tired of watching the AFC's 
representative getting slaughtered year after year. .< 
Both teams play very physical, ball-controlling . 
offense and have displayed a propensity to fall prey , 
to big pass plays on defense.
So, unlike past years, there is at least an oppor-' r 
tunity for a classic, bone-jarring rumble on Sun- , 
day. But whether the game goes down to the lastminute or the fans start streaming out after half/ r 
time to beat the traffic, there is one thing of which' 
the bookies and I are sure: The Cowboys combina*< ; 
tion of strength on offense and speed on defense , 
will ultimately prove to be more than the Steeleais 
can handle. Yesiree Bob, the Lombardi trophy-is , 
going home to Dallas.

Hoopsters battle through break
Mens team stands 7-7 overall, 2-3 in UAA
By ADAM VINCENT
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
On Friday, the mens basket
ball team had a disappointing 
loss to fellow UAA rival New 
York University, 71-54. It was a 
night of missed opportunities on 
the part of the Tartans. Senior 
Kevin Byrne led all Tartans with
nutgU9 sIbUgfEaaRhgahu shuhwu 1twaEg 
RguEvUgo hut KEEg o[EEawu [ga a[U 
Rhgahuo wu OgwthN4o hfU hhwuoa YU7
16 points and nine rebounds, 
but he was the lone bright spot 
this evening. While Senior Jon 
Blanciak and junior Rich Bodnar 
also helped the attack with 10 
and nine points respectively, the 
rest of the team managed much 
more than that.
It was a frustrating loss be
cause the team took 14 more 
shots than New York, yet 
they didnt make as many 
shots, 19 to NYUs 25. The 
Tartan squad also heavily 
out-rebounded New York, 
led by Blanciaks 13, but it 
didnt seem to help. They 
werent victimized by 
turnovers, as CMU won 
the turnover battle as well, 
led by Bodnars five steals. 
The problem with this 
game was a poor shooting 
evening. For the game, 
they shot 27.5 percent with 
New York shooting 45.5 
percent. The first half of 
this game, the team kept 
it close due to ugly shoot
ing on both, sides, but in 
the second half, New York 
made 65 percent of their
shots to our 31 percent.
Over break, Byrne cleared over 
1000 points. He did this in a 
game where the Tartans lost to 
Springfield College in the finals 
of the Naismith Classic, even 
with his 22 point, 10 rebound 
performance, helped out by
nutgU9 sIbUgfEaaRhgahu shuhwu 1twaEg 
JuwEg hgt iwI[ rEtuhg MEEmo aE Khoo wuowtU7
sophomore LaDale Whitmeyers 
12. He is also one of Division 
Ills top players, ranked 44th in 
scoring and 21st in rebounding 
with averages of 21.4 and 10.8, 
respectively. In addition to this, 
the Tartans are also one of the
top rebounding schools in Divi
sion III, out-rebounding its op
ponents by an average of 13.7 a 
game, fifth overall.
Last week against UAA foe 
Johns Hopkins, the Tartans lost 
a heartbreaker 82-73 in over
time. Byrne dominated by scor
ing 26 points, in
cluding three 
out of five from 
three -pointland. Fellow se
nior forward 
Eric Ronzio had 
16 points and 
eight boards in 
the losing cause. 
In games over 
the break, Janu
ary 10 proved to 
be this seasons 
best offense per
formance to 
date, a 10170 
win over non-conference foe 
Thiel College. Scoring was led 
by Byrne with 18 and nine re
bounds, followed by Senior Steve 
Hartmans 15 and Bodnars 14.
Before that match-up, the Tar
tans beat UAA foe Rochester
67-63 in a tightly contested 
game where Bodnar stole the 
ball and got two of 20 points to 
give them a three-point cush
ion, enough to hold them off. 
Byrne scored 19 to help his 
fellow teammate.
To get to the Finals of the 
aforementioned Naismith 
Classic, the Tartans beat pre
viously unbeaten Trinity Uni
versity of Texas 75-55. Tar
tan scoring was led by Byrne 
again with 22 points and 10 
boards, with Bodnar getting
14 points and Blanciak get
ting 13 points as well as a 
game-high 15 rebounds.
The Tartans lost to Juniata 
at home 70-66, with Blanciak 
scoring 18 and Byrne scoring
15 and getting 13 boards. In 
addition, the team fell to UAA 
rival Emory in a close 62-61 
defeat. Byrne had 21 points 
and 12 boards while Blanciak 
had 12 points. The Tartans 
faced UAA foe Brandeis Uni
versity on Sunday, and go on 
the road to take on another 
UAA opponent, Washington 
University (Mo.) this Friday.
Womens team wins first UAA game of season
By PAUL BOOTHE
Tartan Sports Editor
The womens team fell to UAA com
petitor New York University 55-41 
this past Friday in Skibo Gymnasium. 
It was either teams game going into 
the half, with New York leading 26- 
21, but in the second half the Tartans 
had problems sinking their shots. New 
York, which remains undefeated this 
season, controlled the final minutes of 
the game and took the win. Junior 
guard/forward Kristen Kupfer led the 
teams scoring with 13 points on top of 
11 rebounds, and j unior forward/guard 
Penny Summerville added eight points 
to the scoreboard.
This tough loss comes after last 
Mondays convincing 83-57 win over 
La Roche College on the road. Going 
into the second half, CMU held nearly 
double La Roches score, 44-23, and 
never looked back until the game was 
over. The Tartans had the lead at the 
end of the first half because the squad
not only outshot the other team, but also 
had a much higher scoring percentage. 
Summerville and Kupfer each had pheGoahvE phuzUgMhRhgahu C[EaEghK[Ug 
JuwEg hgt KgwoaUu KKdUg tgwvUo aE a[U [EEK7
nomenal games, With 22 and 19 points 
respectively.
The team has had an extremely busy 
six weeks, having played 
straight through winter break. 
In that time, they have gone up 
against five other teams and par
ticipated in two tournaments.
They challenged UAA com
petitor Johns Hopkins Univer
sity on the road on January 12 
and lost 77-70 in the final min
utes of the match-up. Although 
the team was down 38-26 going 
into the second half, they at
tacked offensively and tied the 
score at 56-56 with under two 
minutes remaining in regular 
play. The Tartans even pulled 
ahead in the final minutes, only 
to have the game go into over
time after a set of foul shots by 
Johns Hopkins tied the score at 
60. The Blue Jays took control of 
the overtime period for the win. 
Sophomore forward Katie
OLeary shot for a career high of 26 
points, with nine rebounds, and junior 
guard Penny Summerville scored 15 
points on top of her career high 18 re
bounds. Junior forward Kristen Kupfer 
had 12 points and 10 rebounds.
Earlier that week, the Tartans dropped 
a home match against Grove City Col
lege, 53-45. OLeary scored 11 points 
and 10 rebounds, while Summerville 
tallied 10 points and seven rebounds.
It was a battle to the end when CMU 
took on the University of Rochester in 
the Skibo Gymnasium for the first game 
of the new year on January 6. When the 
final buzzer sounded, the Tartans had 
their first UAA win of the season, edging 
out the Yellowjackets 4944. With just 
over three minutes remaining in the 
second half, the game was a dead heat, 
CMU leading 42-41. Junior guard Kelly 
Gaitens three-pointer extended the 
teams lead, but Rochester answered 
with a three-pointer of their own a 
minute later. But the Tartans brought it

Tartan Staffwriter
The CMU ice hockey team 
faced flooding, sleet and snow to 
face New York University on 
Friday. They arrived late, hadnt 
eaten in eight hours and had 
driven for ten straight. But they 
werent complaining. With miss
ing rookies (freshmen Dino 
Sanchez, Steve Leonhart and 
Keith Garrett), as well as the 
absence of defensemen Bryan 
Campo, and junior scorers Ray 
Ardire and Relja Ivanovic, the 
new players knew that they had 
to step up and jump start their 
lines. Grad student, George 
Pavlic, in his debut as a Tartan, 
defensively destroyed everyone 
who came within his reach.
In the first it did not look good 
with NYU scoring three unan
swered goals in the first eight 
minutes of play. Sophomore 
starting goalie, Derek Jander, 
Was rained on by fifteen shots in 
the first, most coming in that 
first ten minutes.
The Tartans regrouped and 
attacked. The Crash Line of jun
iors Jim Buck and Anthony Paul 
and senior captain Roger 
Maddalena scored two goals 
within five minutes (Maddalena 
from junior defenseman Chris 
Adukaitis and Buck unassisted) 
set the NYU players on a 
scramble. Grad Student Dan 
Kodeshs break away goal, set 
up in the CMU zone by sopho
more defenseman Paul
Voulgaris and Adukaitis, set the 
Tartan bench on fire going into 
the second.
In the second, the momentum 
did not let up as the first line 
smashed in another Maddalena, 
fresh from the penalty box, slice 
to the near post, dribbling in for 
the go ahead at 43. Tied sev
eral minutes later, the game 
became a tennis match of goals, 
CMU keeping the advantage in 
control and shots. With a switch 
of goalies, (Jander ending with 
seventeen saves) junior Jon 
Kliegman raced into net.
Pavlic, energized by CMUs 
man down drive, skated 
into the NYU zone fed 
from Maddalena and 
Buck, and let his pres
ence be known again  
on the scoreboard, shorthanded. After another 
first line goal, (Buck 
from grad student Blair 
Echols and Maddalena) 
the starting defensemen 
dug in and combined to 
score on the power play 
with a wrister from 
Adukaitis from
Voulgaris, to end the pe
riod in CMUs favor 7-6.
In the third, the team 
ran out of gas. CMU held 
onto their lead until half 
way through the third when they 
allowed NYU the shooting ad
vantage and Kleigman and the 
defensemen floundered in stone
walling. With three NYU unan
swered goals to end the game as
they had started it, the Tartans 
skated off with their heads up; 
hungry and sore. The score was 
9-7 NYU, in exhibition play, but 
CMU had to put it behind them. 
Ahead lay another drive home 
in the morning, and another 
game in 24 hours.
Coach Maddalena praised the 
mens effort and stressed the 
importance of the NYU game. 
Its important to play other UAA 
teams. This will encourage the 
development of hockey within 
other UAA schools and bolster 
inter-conference play.
We all have demons. Things
night as Carnegie Mellon came 
home to face Edinboro in West
ern Division hockey action.
Both teams were fighting the 
clock. There was a ten-thirty cur
few, imposed by the rink, on the 
game. If the game wasnt over in 
two hours, they would cut it 
short. The first period both teams 
played cool and clean. The open
ing goal saw Voulgaris coming 
up big again  this time offen
sively with the shot from the 
blue line, assist by Buck. 
Edinboro, surprisingly tight, 
countered on Kleigman making 
it one-all going into the second.

bUoKwaU h o[EgaUuUt a[wgt KUgwEtL a[U Rhgahu [EImUN aUhf KMhNUt 9UMM aE cUha 1twucEgE7
in our lives which seem simple 
to others, but so difficult to one 
person. Goalie Jon Kliegman has 
a demon when it comes to facing 
Edinboro in net. He had a chance 
to redeem himself Saturday
With no time to clean the ice 
between periods, the teams had 
to rest up fast. They had outshot 
the opponents two to one in the 
first, most shots coming with 
the return of junior Ray Ardire,
notorious for his scoring 
drives. But Ardire was seeing 
demons too, time and time 
again being denied by the 
Edinboro goaltender and the 
post. Another new graduate 
student addition, Chris 
Cramer, also put together a 
strong offense in the first  
also being denied in the points 
category. But they had tired 
the Edinboro team and now 
would pick up the pace.
The second period was all 
Carnegie Mellon, with two 
goals off of the first line less 
than thiry seconds apart 
(Maddalena from 
Sullivan and Buck, 
and Anthony Paul, 
unassisted).
Being down 3-1, 
Edinboro began to 
get punchy. The 
cheap shots that put 
three Edinboro play
ers in the box within 
a minute of each 
other, set up a long 
power play drive for 
Carnegie Mellon.
That was the 
green light for 
Ardire. Despite the 
Edinboro coachs cry 
to his players, Dont 
let him (Ardire) hyp
notize you, watch his checks! 
and despite the demons, 
Ardire finally put it in what 
turned out to be the game win
ner, with thirty-five seconds

The Alley Oop
by Chris Cannon
NBA holds 
mighty pairs
With a Bam! Biff! Pow! the 1995. 
96 NBA season is well into swing, 
pulling no punches. As the All-Star 
break approaches, new and improved 
dynamic duos lead their teams to se
cure positions for a playoff run. Young 
and old, east and west, everyone knows 
it takes two.
The Bucks, Bullets, and Mavericks 
have each used a pair of young guns to 
get them going. Jason Kidd and Jimmy 
Jackson have made the most of Jamal 
Mashburns injury and the Mavs have 
been winning again. Theyll have to 
better their shooting, though, for Dal
las to rebound from their 12-24 start.
Glenn Robinson and Vin Baker have 
finally found their groove and are 
poised to give the Bucks a late playoff 
run. They are one of six pairs of team
mates, with each averaging over 20 
points per game. In D.C., the Bullets 
are only two games shy from last years 
win total. J uwan Howard has the team 
playing okay, but Chris Webber looked 
like a superhero in his mere 14 games 
this season.
Out West, Gary Payton has been 
good, but Shawn Kemp puts the 
Slam! in Seattle. With new costumes 
and a shorter name, the Sonics are 
leading their division.
David Robinson has been lookingfor 
a second cape in San Antonio and 
this season Sean Elliott has delivered. 
The Spurs have a two-game lead over 
the Jazz. In Utah, perennial all-stars 
John Stockton and Karl Malone are 
back to their usual crime fighting.
New cape-less crusaders keep pop
ping up all over the league. Detroit, 
which is 19-17, has Allan Houston 
scoring again and Grant Hill is a triple 
double machine. However, Hill has 
been less than lethal behind the threepoint line.
Nick Van Excel and Cedric Ceballos 
have been the one-two punch in L.A. 
Theyre good at 21-17, but a far cry 
from the Magic/Kareem combo of the 
80s.
In Miami, Pat Riley has Alonzo 
Mourning and Billy Owens doing the 
leg work, while the rest of the team 
hands out some vigilante justice. This, 
will mark the first season that Pat. 
Riley doesnt win 50 games as a coach, 
but without him, the Heat would have 
easily lost 50 games.
In Gotham, Patrick Ewing has been 
without a sidekick and the Pacers 
sometimes dont even have a dynamic 
solo. Both teams are 2413 and second 
in their divisions. Either one needs a 
star if they want to get back to the 
Eastern Conference Championship.
No superstar search would be com
plete without the leagues best. The 
two-time defending champion Rock
ets ride the reunited Hakeem 
Olajuwon and Clyde Drexler. Houston 
still plays ho-hum basketball during 
the season but will crank it up for the 
playoffs.
Shaquille ONeal has been the un
questioned Dark Knight in Orlando, 
but Penny Hardaway has them saying 
holy skills Batman! Then of course 
there are the Bulls, who were so upset 
that the Pacers ruined their 80-win 
season that they ripped off ten victo
ries in a row.
Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen

Friday Night Doom
I 1996 Trends
By SHANNON GIBNEY
Tartan Contributing Editor
Racial harmony was an important 
mission of Martin Luther King Jr., and 
he was very successful in bridging the 
gulf between races. Unfortunately, that 
chasm between black and white Ameri
cans, across which King extended his 
reach, is still undeniably with us, said 
Esther Bush, president and CEO of the 
Urban League of Pittsburgh and guest 
speaker at CMUs annual MLK Day 
celebration. This years festivities be
gan at 4:30 pm Monday and were held in 
the Adamson Wing; the large room over
flowed with students and staff.
1996 was Martin Luther King Jrs 
67th birthday, and the 1 Oth anniversary 
of the national holiday. The national 
theme was Help Somebody: Every 
American Can Make a Difference, an 
idea which Bush and other speakers 
who participated in the program, ex
plored.
It is disastrous to let sour race rela
tions to let get in the way of addressing 
imperative issues, such as wealth, pov
erty, productivity, and the quality of life 
of this country, Bush said It is disas
trous not to tap into all of the diverse 
human experiences and potential that 
exist in this country, as we tackle the 
challenges of the next millennia.
Bush explained that Martin Luther
King Jr.s dream of a more inclusive and 
racially unified America is still far from 
being a reality, because of economic, 
social, gender, and racial divisions that 
prevent many of us from becoming 
change agents.
The personal decision to be a change 
agent may not lead down the same revo
lutionary path that Dr. Martin Luther
King forged, but it isa route that he 
helped open to all of us. You can start 
now by reaching out to someone who is 
racially or ethnically different from your
self, Bush said.
Bush asserted that the university en
vironment is the optimal place to be
come an agent for change, because so 
many different groups are represented 
within it. She encouraged students to
step beyond their traditional and com
fortable roles and form relationships 
with those from different backgrounds 
and experiences.
She said, Whats good about today is 
that we have everybodys permission to 
talk about race. Dont use this moment 
to talk about the differences. Use it to 
discuss the similarities and needs of all
Americans to make the United States 
all that it can be...
Frank Ligons, president of Spirit, be
gan the celebration by the audience to 
incorporate Martin Luther King Jr.s 
message into their daily lives.
To be able to effectively face the trials 
and tribulations of living in an unjust 
society we will need to borrow strength 
and inspiration from Dr. King everyday.
We will need to refresh our minds and 
hearts of the principles of Kawaanza 
every single week, and we will need to 
celebrate and explore our rich cultural 
and intellectual heritage every single 
month, Ligons said. It is only through 
doing these things that we may prove 
ourselves victorious in these trying 
times, and slowly but inexorably move 
towards the beloved community that 
Dr. King died fighting for.
CMU President Mehrabian was also 
present for the activities; he gave a 
speech in which he reaffirmed the 
Universitys commitment to commu
nity service and act. One of the most 
important aspects of my own personal 
vision for this University is that we 
contribute to our community, that we 
help somebody every day, he said.
Mehrabian said that CMU has aided 
in the economic improvement of the 
region, as well as increased the acces
sibility of Pittsburgh for people with 
disabilities. He also praised student 
participation in programs that embrace 
community involvement, such as CMAP, 
Spirit, National Society of Black Engi
neers, the Role Models Program, and 
the Center for University Outreach.
I think this speaks well of our [uni
versity] community, a community that 
has dedicated itself to reaching out be
yond its boundaries. I think that this is 
CMUhoU oUU s8KL KhU 8 2
It is only through doing these things that we 
may... move towards the beloved community 
that Dr. King died fighting for.

Students should remember King all year round
Rv77 R n QFs R7"i vyHdwMi ud gguu gavEMM a r Kh uwM sRdugM dgaBy JASON ERMER
\Tartan Junior Staffwriter
We should live [his] dream every 
day, not just one day, said Elaine 
Atkinson, director of the Role Models 
Program. Observing one day a year, to 
me, means nothing if your actions dont 
honor what Martin Luther King stands 
for during the rest of the year. 
Atkinson, like many administrators, 
believes that students still have the 
opportunity to observe Martin Luther 
ng Jr. Day despite the fact that they 
are obligatedto attend classes. Keeping 
in mind the meaning of MLK Day to 
celebrate the strides that have been 
made in the civil rights movement, and 
to remember those who have striven 
towards freedom it seems that many 
students have shifted the focus of the 
;i?ay to whether they can skip class, Tn 
all honesty, students want to observe 
MLK Day so they can sleep in, said 
sophomore IDS major Bob Dean.
Holding class on MLK day gave stu
dents a reason to attend the programs
held on campus, _______________________
Atkinson said.
Simply because 
CMU remained 
openisnottosay 
that the Univer
sity is not con
cerned with mi
nority issues.
Joe Trotter, a
professor of his- ________________________
 ry, feels 'that
aiding programs throughout the day 
would offer campus members an oppor
tunity to pour back and reflect on the 
words and deeds of King; an opportu
nity to bring back into focus the aspira
tions and dreams of one of the greatest 
civil rights leaders of all time.
I dont think students should be pe
nalized if they choose to miss classes on 
MLK Day, Atkinson said. It should be 
considered a religious holiday. If they 
have a right to honor those, I think they 
should be given the opportunity to make 
a personal decision about MLK day. 
Some students disagree with her 
line of thinking. You shouldnt relate 
MLK Day to religious holidays, says 
Dave Martino, sophomore drama ma
jor. Im outraged that we dont cel
ebrate the day because where I come 
from, Ive been taught that its an 
important day.
Michael Murphy, Dean of Student 
Affairs, said that current university 
policy supports the students right to 
decide for themselves how they celebrate 
the holiday. Given the great diversity 
within the community, the sentiment is
that individuals generally be allowed to 
make personal decisions about those 
days which they choose to take off to 
celebrate religious or other holidays, 
Murphy said. For students, there is a 
provision to request faculty days off for 
religious or celebrational purposes. 
Whether CMU holds classes does 
not seem to be the issue in the eyes of 
some students. The meaning of the 
holiday has been lost, especially on 
the younger generation, said Derek 
Cissel, a freshman in CIT, For those 
that went through that era, thats not 
the case. According to some, a dis
tinction must be made between Mar
tin Luther King Day and the celebra
tion of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.s 
birthday. It would be nice for the 
University to close, Trotter said. It 
would be a symbolic recognition of the 
civil rights struggle and how it contin
ues today, but [Dr. Kings] influence is 
more enduring than one day.
At the opposite end of the spectrum 
are students who would categorize MLK 
Day as another holiday that CMU seems
________________________ to overlook.
Ken Flagg, a 
sophomore 
music composi
tion major, 
said, Al
though I iiink 
its disrespect
ful [to not close 
school], it lends
_________________________ a good sense of
continuity to 
all sorts of holidays, meaning that CMU 
celebrates neither Columbus Day nor 
Veterans Day. It wouldnt have been 
that much of a logistical problem, said 
Eric Watts, senior industrial design ma
jor, but as a private university, if [CMU] 
recognized MLK Day, what else would 
they have to recognize?
Its the universitys perogative to cel
ebrate what they want because its a 
private institution, Atkinson said. Stu
dents, however, also have the preroga
tive to celebrate in the way that they 
choose. [Missing school] is not the best 
way to celebrate [MLK Day], but what 
else are we going to do? asked Alex 
Victoria, sophomore IDS major.
There were in fact, a number of school 
sponsored events held on campus in 
honor of MLK.
Regardless of the way students choose 
to honor the memory of Martin Luther 
King, Jr., his presence is still felt by 
many at CMU. As Atkinson said, I 
think its a victory that MLK is recog
nized as an international leader. He 
will always remain a part of history that 
our children will know.
[Dr. King] will always 
remain a part of history 
that our children will 
know.

Free food. Free movies. New People. Fun Activi
ties. Greek Rush at any time is an exciting experi
ence for many CMU students. So what makes 
Spring Rush so different?
A lot of people feel that they simply arent ready 
to make the commitment to Greek life in the fall, 
and the spring is a better time for them, said 
Eileen OShea, current Rush Chair for Zeta Psi 
Sigma.
I rushed in the fall, said Kristine Bonaimo, a 
senior Industrial Management major and a sister 
at Delta Gamma sorority, because not all [soror
ity] houses have Spring Rush and I wanted to look 
at every house and pick the one that was the best 
fit for me. Spring Rush is much less formal. [For 
sororities] there are no invitations or formal rush 
rues and strict schedules, and you dont have to 
sign up or pay a fee to participate.
Because sororities have a 50 member ceiling 
which makes it impossible for some houses to have 
a Spring Rush, Fall Rush can be a very hectic 
experience with conditions that some say make 
Rushees apprehensive about the rushing pro
cess. Formal Rush is such a hassle for everyone 
involved and Spring Rush is a lot more relaxed in 
areas such as dress code and party organization. In 
general, it is more comfortable for both the houses 
and those who decide to rush, said Ann Marie 
Mewherter, a junior chemical engineering major 
and a sister at Tri-Delta.
Since the majority of students who participate in 
rush activities are first-year students. Spring Rush 
also provides a less busy time to become familiar 
with the workings of the Greek system in general. 
It is easier to focus on rushing when freshmen are 
comfortable with their surroundings and their life 
away from home.
Some parents [of first-year students] want their 
son or daughter to first get adjusted to CMU 
academically before they jump into any social situ
ation, said Greek Advisor Janine Coppolla. But 
other students find immediate brotherhood and 
sisterhood to be a huge advantage.
Pauly Burke, Interfraternity Council (IFC) Rush 
Chair and a junior communication design major 
agrees with Coppolla. Greek 
life can provide a common 
bond for students. It is cen
tered around a fellowship that 
lacks among the rest of the 
campus community and 
therefore provides for instant 
friendship and social activi
ties, he said.
However, some students are 
not so anxious to experience 
rush activities or become in
volved in Greek life.
[One reason] is because cer
tain people attach a negative 
connotation to the Greek sys
tem, and people are scared 
because of their preconceived 
notions about what Greek life 
is, said Chauncey Upson,
Rush Chair at Delta Upsilon 
and a sophomore Industrial 
Mangement major.
These are sometimes the 
people who you find at Spring 
Rush, because they have had 
a chance to meet people who 
are Greek and find out for 
themselves what the organi
zation is about. They are 
mainly the first-year students 
who are academically com
fortable but feel the lack of 
society on campus so they de
cide to try Spring Rush.
Sophomore art major,
Shaunach Talley, a sister at 
Kappa Alpha Theta, didnt 
think she wanted to join a 
sorority because she didnt 
want to be a stereotypical so
rority girl. I didnt think it fit 
in with my personality. But
were having and thought it would give me a chance 
to have more friends and a social life on campus, 
she said. While some students 
only rush to go to good par
ties, said Doug Brady, presi
dent of Sigma Psi Epsilon and 
senior physics major. The 
main reason people rush is 
probably to establish friend
ships and meet good people. 
Sig Ep is the newest frater
nity on campus and this Spring 
Rush is the first major event it 
will be participating in as a 
collective fraternity. Unlike 
other fraternities and sorori
ties, Sig Ep will be recruiting 
members all year long, not 
just in two week rush time 
periods.
But no matter if students 
pick fall, spring or all-year op
portunities, rush proves to be 
a very fun and interesting time 
for many people. With all of 
the various activities such as 
movie night, paintball, bowl
ing, mixers, parties and the 
elusive mystery night at 
some houses, everyone who is 
interested in the Greek sys
tem and rushing can enjoy 
themselves.
Rush is one of the most 
exciting times at Delta 
Gamma, said sophomore psy
chology major, Carly 
Cenedella, Delta Gamma 
Rush Chair. We cannot wait 
to make new friends and en
joy rush events.
[Anyone interested in rush
ing a fraternity or sorority] 
should find a poster and at
tend the events at the various
when my friends rushed, I saw how much fun they houses, said Mewherter. Its that simple.
1996 winter 
orientation helps 
students grow
By S. VENKATASUBBAN
Tartan Features Co-Editor 
& ERIC SALZMAN
Tartan Personnel Manager
Fall orientation focuses on giving new stu
dents an overall impression of college life, 
socially, academically, and emotionally. The 
1996 Winter Orientation, which took place 
this past Sunday, narrowed its scope to give 
students an opportunity to get expert advice 
on their academic and living habits.
The mission of Winter Orientation is differ
ent, said Kimberly DiDonato, residence life 
coordinator for first year student program
ming.
The purpose is to orient students on a 
slightly different level. Were honing in on 
specific issues that will ensure success.
In the fall, Residence Life is mainly inter
ested in addressing every single issue that 
students might face, but as the second semes
ter kicks in, they have time to zero in on 
specific areas of interest. Many of the pro
grams feature subjects like how to meet 
people and how to get involved.
I really suggest that students take advan
tage of these lectures like the art of empower
ment and networking, said DiDonato. Fall 
orientation is like summer camp almost, she 
said. Students are beginning college for the 
first time and need to adapt quickly: socially 
and emotionally. By the second semester, 
youve had the chance to get used to the new 
environment and now you have a chance to do 
some fine tuning.
There are three kinds of people who attend 
.Winter Orientation, according to DiDonato.

elf a re restrictions affect women
dren to collect more benefits. None of 
these things are true. The fact is, the 
AFDC accounts for one percent of the 
federal budget, and with food stamps, 
the welfare system makes up only three 
percent. Isnt providing for families be
low the poverty line worth three percent
Cracking The Myth
by Amber Benezra
1996 will be an important election year 
or anyone who cares about education, 
;he environment, abortion, welfare,
d any otherfederally funded 
Sjcial programs. The GOP is 
lound and determined to balince the budget, even if it 
beans cutting the most basic and 
rucial government spending. In almost 
il) cases, these budget reforms turn into 
tender issues-welfare being one of the 
rtost significant.
'According to Ms. magazine in 1995, 
nore than seventy percent of families on 
velfare consist of a woman and one or 
wo children. Single mothers who have 
(radically no access to education, job 
raining, or child care look to the Aid to 
ijimilies with Dependent Children 
AFDC) for assistance, and nearly three 
ii)t of four women go off the program 
vjthin two years. Welfare assistance is 
dial for women who have no other opions during illness, unemployment, 
:hildbirth, divorce, or after leaving a 
situation of domestic violence. Economic 
equality rages against these women, 
and the Republican congress would like 
o; eliminate the tiny amount of federal 
lid they now receive. Republicans porray the welfare system as a huge drain 
>ii federal funds, saying that it must be 
:ut to balance the budget, depicting welare recipients as lazy schemers who 
lave great numbers of illegitimate chilRyan Rhoads/
OUhagUo "E-1twaEg
of our budget (especially when things 
like defense spending make up over fifty 
percent)? Another fact is that low-income women do not have more and more 
children just to reap the welfare benefits-only $67 a month is provided for 
each additional child, and the longer a 
woman stays on AFDC, the less likely it 
is she will have more children. These 
women are not living in the lap of luxury, 
plotting different ways to cheat the sys
tem; the average monthly payment of 
AFDC and food stamps combined is $645, 
for the year, $7740, which is well below 
poverty.
As the Republican congress pushes 
through punitive reform measures that 
will attempt to completely phase out
the food stamp system within 5 years, 
and take children away from unwed 
teenage mothers, moral judgment of 
women becomes anissue. Welfare moth
ers have been condemned for having 
children for financial gain, and Newt 
Gingrich has proposed taking children 
from young, unmarried mothers that 
are deemed unfit by the government and 
reinstituing the orphanage system (in
terestingly enough, the cost per child in 
an orphanage is about $36,000 a year). 
As Ms. states, these measures, assume 
that the behavior, attitudes, and values 
of women on welfare are the prob
lem. Real reform would mean 
measures that would both 
guarantee reproductive free
dom and help women and 
their families permanently escape 
from poverty. Women who receive wel
fare benefits have the same rights as all 
women, and have the same goals from 
their families.
The welfare system needs to be 
changed, there are people who take ad
vantage of it, and it is not functioning as 
a productive social system. But com
pletely eliminating it is not the answer. 
Women are on the receiving end of social 
and economic violence with nowhere else 
to turn. Welfare reform needs to support 
and expand educational and job train
ing programs in conjunction with the 
creation of jobs, so that women have 
other options besides governmental aid. 
Health care, child care, unemployment, 
disability insurance, all must be avail
able for people with low-incomes. How 
can we really expect the extreme prob
lem of poverty in this country to go away 
if we just turn our backs on it? How can 
we stand by and let Republicans attack 
women on welfare and widen both the 
poverty and gender inequality gaps?

Model physics TA excels at CMU
In the Spotlight
by Dan Rosenberg
Perhaps Andrea Santoro can best be 
assessed by the number of people who 
vaved to her during the course of this 
nterview. Or perhaps the fact that her 
npst challenging class at CMU was also 
ler favorite best describes the kind of 
i^rson Santoro is.
Santoro came to CMU four years ago 
Jecause I wanted to go to a university 
hat had a large physics department, so 
fat I could get a variety of different 
tiewpoints on physics and see a variety 
different kinds of research, but I didnt 
v&nt to go to Penn State because it was 
yfey too close to home (Santoros family 
ives in State College, PA), so Carnegie 
Mellon provided a happy medium. Its 
fg enough that you have a lot of things 
oing on in the department, but its 
Mall enough that people in the depart
ment know you and youre not just one of 
He faceless masses the way you are at 
pin State.
It is her love and devotion to Physics 
hat has played the largest role in her
*MU career. Although she will also be 
eceiving a degree in mathematics, 
Jntoro stated that Ive known since I 
N.as about 11 that I wanted to be a 
tyysics major. She has applied to six 
faduate schools, her first choice being 
AT, and, in six years, she hopes to have 
jph.D. in Physics.
Santoro hopes to use her degree to 
^come a university professor. Ive 
^nted to be a teacher since high school, 
le stated, but her decision to teach at 
ie university level also came from the 
^ that she really enjoys teaching as
well as doing research. I dont think Id 
want to do one or the other exclusively, 
she said. Another factor in her decision 
to become an educator has been her role 
as a TA for 33-111 (Physics for Science 
Students I) for the past year and a half. 
She said that being a TA is really fun 
because you get to interact with incom
ing freshmen...and you can sort of re
member when you took the class and 
say, Oh yeah, I remember how this was 
difficult and explain the material in a 
better way.
One person who expresses confidence 
in Santoros abilities to teach is Profes
sor Gregg Franklin, the instructor of 33-
111. He said, Shes done an excellent 
job. She is able to determine the areas in 
which people need help and provide them 
with the necessary assistance. 
Although she loves being a TA, Santoro 
thrives on being in a laboratory. One of 
the most exciting things Ive done at 
CMU is lab work. This semester Im 
doing work (for academic credit) in the 
Bucky Ball Group (an interdisciplinary 
organization for students in physics, 
chemistry at materials science), and I 
did that last semester as well. Its been 
really exciting to work with a real re
search group thats doing sort of cutting 
edge research. At the present time, 
Santoro is studying nanoparticles, 
namely gamma iron oxide, which is a 
substance she described as sort of like 
rust, but it has a different crystalline 
form; its used as a magnetic data stor
age medium. Im trying to study its opti
cal properties and also its conducting 
properties.
When not engaging in physics-related 
activities, Santoro enjoys reading, al
though she finds that she has little time 
to do it. She periodically attends rectitals 
and plays in CFA and watches Friends 
and Lois and Clark regularly.
Santoro is also the president and co
founder of the Newman Club, a small
but close-knit organization that provides 
religious support for Catholics on cam
pus. She is also very involved with the 
Oratory, which is sponsored by the Ro
man Catholic Chaplaincy and hosts 
many activities for both CMU and Pitt 
students, namely a weekly dinner and 
discussion session. Santoro said, Ive 
met a lot of people who are really sup
portive, and almost all of my friends now 
are people that Ive met at the Oratory. 
Its also given me an opportunity to meet 
people at Pitt, which is a thing you often 
dont get an opportunity to do. And its 
just been fun. Retreats have been really 
fun. Its been really good for me as a 
Catholic.
Andrea also has close relationships 
with people outside of Pittsburgh. She 
keeps in touch with her family in State 
College and her sister, who is a fresh
man at Penn State. She also visits her 
boyfriend, who is a computer engineer in 
Boston, on a regular basis.
CMU, however, is currently where her 
heart is. Santoro said that Ive really 
liked it here. Ive always liked 
Pittsburgh..and Ive always felt that 
there was a lot to do..and there always 
seems to be a lot going on on campus: 
there are movies, there are things you 
can go see at CFA. Theres a lot that this 
campus has to offer. Its a very diverse 
campus. She is, however, eagerly an
ticipating commencement (Im sure 
commencement will be one of the high 
points of my life). Im really ready to go 
somewhere new at this point... Im re
ally excited.
In ten years, Santoro hopes to be a 
junior faculty member at a respected 
university. By doing laboratory research 
and being a teachers assistance for two 
physics recitation sections at CMU, shes 
nearly there. It seems certain that she 
will reach her goal.
Dan Rosenberg is still going.
Dining carts keep 
students on the run
Pulp Free
by Eric Saizman
Im thinking that for the sake of 
saving time, maybe we could just have 
Slim Fast drink mix at the front desk 
in each dorm. This way we could pick 
up some choco-yum-yums, mix with 
water, devour it and be on our way. 
Students could add at least a good 17 
minutes to their day through this sim
plified process of nourishment. After 
all, the carts get to be really time 
consuming what with waiting in line 
and then doing that funny eat while 
you walk but dont drip on your shirt 
saunter to class that other normal 
human beings call lunch-time.
Maybe even Slim Fast is too time 
consuming. I knowwhy not have IV 
units installed in the lecture halls? 
This way, we dont even need to add 
water and stir. Just go to class, whip 
out your notebook, pen, and needle. 
Youre ready to go. Enjoy a fine cui
sine being fed into your arm intrave
nously while discovering how the an
cient Incas managed to carve stone to 
form a more sophisticated plumbing 
system than what exists in modern 
Texas. Better yet, why not have an 
interactive dining Web page. Students 
can just click on the meal of their 
choice and have the necessary vita
mins and nutrients emailed to their 
accounts. Now that would save time.
I feel a little guilty whining about 
dining services, but more carts? Come 
on people. Its like CMU is following 
FOXs late night show efforts. Theyve 
got crap, and they think they can fix it 
by just throwing more crap at us.
The guilt comes from the people I
actually see working for dining ser
vices. Theyre so sweet and they really 
try. Its kind of like the Clinton admin
istration. Really, what can they do  
they try and try, but when the boss 
continues to blow it over and over again, 
is there any hope to be had?
Somewhere up top, administrative 
genius has led to a swarming push
cart invasion at CMU. Lets get one 
thing straight. We all work pretty 
hard here. We keep busy. We stress. 
De we really need the administration 
to subtlely (and I use that word 
loosely) telling s not to even stop to 
eat for twenty minutes? Do not stop
 you must pass go! Get to your next 
class where the liquid sustenance will 
be pumped into you like gas into a car
 go! Go! GO!
Now what if we sit down? I say, if 
you buy your food at a cart, sit down. 
Have a meal. Make a picnic of it. Now 
that would be legendary. They dont 
want to give you a table and chairs, so 
bring a blanket and sit on the floor. 
Someone steps in your cole slaw  
scoop it up and call it an ecological 
study on the effects a technological 
man has on vegetation.
Administration thinks theyve pro
vided a blessing for us yippers always 
on the run, but maybe they should 
concentrate a little harder on helping 
to convince students that there actu
ally is time to sit and enjoy meals. Of 
course, we all know what might hap
pen then  people might talk to one 
another  then ideas may be shared
 then agreements made  then 
revolution. Heck, Ill settle for a Baker 
Hall sit down picnic. Whos with me?

yond its boundaries. I think that this 
is something that we bring to the 
table... today and everyday of the year, 
in honoring Dr. Martin Luther King 
Jr.s memory.
Junius Putney, a graduate student 
in GSIA, and Audrey Grube, a junior 
in ECE, also gave speeches on the 
meaning of community service in their 
lives.
The United Voices Gospel Choir per
formed musical selections during the 
ceremony. The group also led the au
dience in singing This Little Light of 
Mine, and We Shall Overcome, dur
ing which students and staff joined 
hands.
As indicated by the turnout, and by 
the high levels of student participa
tion in community service, Gloria Hill, 
Director of CMAP, judged this years 
program to be a success.
Hill said, Last year was the begin
ning. I think that the whole message 
of community service associated with 
King is a powerful thing and I think 
its gonna snowball, and as it contin
ues to be the focus I think that a lot of 
positive things are going to start to 
happen. I think its something that 
would make him very, very, happy.
Orientation delivers solid advice through seminars
CMUhohnrUs dgEf KhU 82
IP8 and student leaders, such as 
Mentation counselors, who need 
Faining in areas that effect first(ears.
Dave McWherter, a first year 
student, is one of those fure orientation counselors needtraining. He attended Winter 
Mentation partly because it was 
pquired to be an Orientation 
-unselor and also because [he] 
!as curious to see what it was 
ifcout.
Other students like Brian 
utsell, a junior double major in
ECE and mathematical CS, were 
interested in the preparation and 
networking aspect. I guess [Im 
here] basically to prepare me life 
for after college, he said.
Liz Becker, a freshman in IM, 
said, I want to make academic 
connections.
And indeed, there were aca
demic connections to be made. 
With over 300 students attend
ing the days seminars, informa
tion from how to eat better, to 
Carnegie Mellons history, to how 
to organize a work schedule was 
shared by some of the Universitys
finest faculty.
At noon in the Mellon Audito
rium of GSIA, Mark Stehlik, as
sistant dean of the school of com
puter science, delivered the key
note address in which he stressed 
that students need to find their 
this, and work with it. If theres 
something you want to do and it 
doesnt exist, make it happen, 
he said.
Throughout his speech, which 
evoked an enthusiastic and en
tertained response from the stu
dents, Stehlik emphasized that 
students are in their prime years
to grow and should not limit their 
activities. If all you do is go to 
class and work on research 
projects, thats not good, he said. 
Youve got to get out of the class
room.
Aware of the demanding hours 
CMU students tend to keep, 
Stehlik also noted the need to 
take it easy sometimes. If youre 
not 100 percent, youve got to 
respect the fact that your bodys 
trying to tell you, I need to sleep 
now. Youve got to find unstruc
tured time to just be stupid  
thats important too.

The net, not that I need to tell 
anyone here, is the most in thing 
1996 has to offer us. But, its been 
done; we all know about it. So, 
lets get to whats important.
Phil Donahue is coming back. 
Hes the first, the toughest, and 
;he best. With a bit of luck and a 
:ouple of on-air brawls, he will be 
ecoronated as the king of day
time talk shows. As for sitcoms, 
no one will be knocking Friends 
out of its num
ber one slot for 
while, but 
look for some 
experimental 
surprises from 
]CBS  after 
jail, theyve got 
nothing to lose 
over there.
Popular lit
erature is go
ing to take a 
giant step 
backwards 
and forwards
simultaneously. Backwards in 
the sense that the influence will 
come from 50 years ago; forwards 
in the sense of quality. With generation-X types becoming the 
majority book buying audience 
and commercial loving, process, 
artificial food-eating,
;microwaving baby boomers still 
trying .to get through John 
Grishams latest, some beatnik 
revisionist writers may come into
mvppcirwUl T JLil\IJlv7ilU

96 trends focus on new generation
the spotlight. If only Ethan 
Hawke could guide us all.
Speaking of Hawke ... actually 
lets not. However, his one time 
co-star Winona Ryder should be 
sticking around through 96. She 
will help lead the way for fast 
rising female stars like Drew 
Barrymore and that star from 
Clueless that everyone is so ga-ga 
over.
For big-time leading males, 
keep an eye on Gary Sinise and 
Tim Roth, two actors who have 
proven their incredible talents 
and are on the 
brink of super
stardom. Val 
KwMfUgL 
though al
ready huge, 
will likely be 
Hollywoods 
top stud-puppet box-office 
draw. After a 
stellar perfor
mance in 
Heat, he has 
shown he can 
match the tal
ents of DeNiro and Pacino  
something he proved in Tomb
stone as well as The Doors, but 
might finally get noticed.
As for music, well, that Alonis 
isnt going away any time soon. 
When she wins something at the 
Grammys (shes sure to win some
thing) the hype will only grow. 
Still, she may find some competi
tion from Tori Amos, whose new 
CD will be all the talk among the
shvUgwIm iUIEgtwu "E7
music world for the next month 
or two. For the more hard core 
rock fans, 1996 may be a bit dis
appointing.
Heavy metal is a thing of the 
past, grunge is slowly fading, and 
even punk is 
losingthe steam 
behind its sec
ond coming.
Look for an in
vasion of En
glish dance mu
sic with ABBAesque groups 
like M People 
firmly estab
lishing them
selves on the 
charts (at least 
we can hope).
As for the 
ever-changing world of fashion, 
there are many hot new trends to 
watch for in 96. Among these are 
fabrics with a lot of sheen (for day 
or night), plunging necklines, and 
clothes and accessories in CMUs 
favorite colortartan plaid. Lowslung, hip-hugging jeans that 
emphasize the hips rather than 
the waist are the new look for 
denim this year. Wear them with 
a shirt with a zipper to create a 
great new look for the new year.
If you are worried about being 
in, mainstream though it may be 
(which is, of course, out  hence 
the irony) stick with the predic
tions above or just get your tongue 
pierced.

By JOHN BIGGS
Tartan Forum Editor
I dont want to be a pessimist, 
but there are a lot of problems in 
this country, and they arent get
ting better. Id like to address 
these, in a serious, heartfelt way, 
and, with your help, we can turn 
this whole mess around.
Im talking about fashion. Im 
talking about movies. Im 
talking about books. In short, 
the entertainment industry 
has gotten less and less en
tertaining as the past year 
has rolled along, and Id like 
to make some suggestions on 
what to scrap out of the piles 
and piles of dreck that we call 
our modem culture.
So, with that out of the way, 
lets begin with fashion. Big 
wallet chains are out. While 
they may look cool to some, 
they also look like youve just 
stolen a small dog from a rich 
lady and stuffed it into your 
back pocket. The funny thing 
is that anyone with a wallet 
chain looks like they really 
dont have that much money 
to begin with, let alone 
enough to warrant the use of 
a chain to protect their wallets. 
In fact, you can actually tell how 
much money a person has by look
ing at their chain: those with few 
funds have chains that look like 
they were cut off of posts from 
across the service roads in state 
parks. Those with a lot of money 
look about the same, but their 
chains are more shiny.
While were on the subject of 
pants, big ones are right out in 
my book. Im talking mainsail 
type pants. The kind you can fit 
your family into. Women who 
wear them look kind of big (see 
Richard Dreyfuss). Men who wear 
them look like they have some
thing to hide, and were not talk
ing skinny legs, here, folks.
Movies: The Young Americans 
are out. These are the filmmak
ers, actors, and writers who base 
their entire repertoire on 40s 
gangster films, Mission Impos
sible re-runs, and images of crimi
nals as friendly, funny people who 
arent out to hurt anybody. In
stead, theyre just looking for a 
damn fine cup of coffee.
Pulp Fiction is the prototypical 
Young Americans (Y.A.) film, as 
is Get Shorty, although the book
by Elmore Leonard that it was 
based on was dummed down or 
dummed up for the Y.A. audi
ence.
Die Hard 3 was a Y.A. film 
knock-off, kind of like the rash of 
father-son switcharoo movies that 
came out in the 80s. The yappies, 
as I will now affectionately call 
them, are creating an entirely 
new niche for failed character 
actors like Harvey Big Boy 
Kietel and Johnny Lips 
Travolta.
Music: Yappie music is also all 
the rage, and its right out. This is 
music from bands like Phish and 
Blues Traveller that focuses on 
the post-Dead set and the college 
kids, kind of like us. Next time 
you think about getting that lat
est Dave Matthews release or
suggest yappies Better Than Ezra 
and Counting Crows to your little 
brother, look into Leonard Cohen 
and Bob Dylan instead. Why go 
with the rest when you can listen 
to old guys with talent?
Drama: The new craze in the
atre seems to be the drama-docudramentary. This style is based 
on a series of rambling mono
logues or reflections on some reallife happening like a fire in a 
city or the holocaust or 
somebodys love life. What
ever the topic, these plays are 
simply the reflection of what 
life has become without cheap 
PBS specials.
Books: The rash of novels 
that people read in droves 
and like entirely too much 
are out. Any novel you have 
read, provided youre not an 
English major or someone 
stuck in a cage with only back 
issues of Road and Sport to 
keep you company, is on this 
list.
Were looking at Disclo
sure, Bridges of My ButtL The 
Christmas Box, anything by 
Dean R. Koontz and anything 
by anyone with initials in 
their name.
These are all terrible books. 
Dont read them. Read some new 
novels. Read Galatea 2.2 by Rich
ard Powers for all you linguistic, 
computer types. Read Lori 
Moores Who Will Run the Frog 
Hosptial for a touch of old fash
ioned love of writing. Read some 
Stienbeck, Faulkner, Robbins. 
Anything but the yappies.
That is my final admonition: 
avoid that which comes out of the 
entertainment capitals right now. 
What you do now thats cool, ev
eryone will do in two years.
Its a constant struggle to keep 
out of the way of progress. See 
anything but the yappies.
Wear anything but the yappies. 
Eat anything but the yappies. 
For my sake, please, people. Cant 
we all just get a little saner?

Sweeney Todd fails to please
By JOHN BIGGS
Forum Editor
Walking out of a Stephen 
Sondheim is like spending awe'ek at Christian camp: you 
know all the songs 
and love all of the 
people involved.
Sweeney Todd, The 
Demon Barber of 
Fleet Street is no ex
ception.
The musical is 
about a barber who 
had a wife. This bar
ber lost his wife to a 
wretched old judge 
who sent him off to 
Australia, where all 
good criminals. are 
sent.
Then the barber 
comes back home to 
find his young 
daughter fully 
grown and about to 
marry the wretched 
judge. Luckily, this 
barber still has his 
trusty razor and 
s .rap and grows mad 
while waiting for the 
wretched judge to 
come into his shop 
and take a shave.
In between this 
waiting and mad
ness, there is canni
balism, whoring, and lots of 
dead people.The entire musi
cal is one song, each scene in
terconnecting with every other 
scene with a fluidity that is 
almost maddening.One charac
ter might sing about death and 
decay and another, using the 
same tune, will sing about 
beauty and love. One character 
might be doing a farce, while
still another is getting his throat 
slit.
The main-characters, Sweeney 
(a mildly meilow Steve Barton) 
and Mrs. Lovett (Brooks Almy) 
are strong and well-prepared. The 
rest of the company, including a
 Pittsburgh Public Theatre 
paUvU rhgaEu KEgaghNo a[U awaMU I[hghIaUg wu Sweeny 
Todd.
shrill Johanna, (Jennifer 
Westfeldt) and a midly annoying 
Beggar Woman (Barbara 
Pflaumer) was tight, as was the 
orchestra. Overall, it was well 
done, well staged, and weli acted.
The set, while tail and impres
sive, was plain by most standards.
Built out of drab, worn wood and 
metal, the set strives to be stark 
but just looks old. The costumes
were very nice, and the music 
was loud and audible. However, 
you will notice one thing: noth
ing is astonishing.
Nothing is outstanding. The 
musical, on a whole is simply a 
musical, no more, no less.
Its entertaining, 
but nothing new is 
attempted, nothing 
innovative: it was 
dinner theatre.
If you havent seen 
Sondheim before, his 
genius lies in his mu
sic. Conversational 
in style, the charac
ters do not speak but 
bring about exposi
tion through the lyr
ics.
This style is 
prevelent in most of 
his work, and Todd 
is one of his best. 
However, when aflat 
performance is made 
of it, without exam
ining the intricacies 
possible with the 
style, a great deal of 
strength is lost.I 
wont tell you not to 
go. I will tell you that 
while you will be en
tertained, you'll take 
nothing with you.
The Public 
Theaters Sweeney 
Todd is ear and eye and head 
candy. Ifyou have a sweet tooth, 
get to it. Otherwise, wait for the 
sequel Cimini, The Demon Bar
ber of Craig Street.

and Sundays at 2 and 7pm. For

Friday Night Doom
By Dizzy Murphy
Welcome to a new semester of 
classes, and fun if you can spare 
the time.
If you do have it, Friday Night 
DOOM is back to review video 
games for you to play on your off 
times, recommendingwhattobuy 
and what to avoid like a Tartan 
burger.
Today Ill review two games 
that I recently played. EF2000 
and Demolition Derby. The first 
is a complex flight simulation pro
gram and the second, well... the 
name says it all.
EF2000 without a doubt is the 
most advanced combat flight 
simulator in the market today.
You fly Europes future air com
bat fighter, (hence the 2000 year 
mark) against different Russian 
and American fighters.
First lets deal with the bad 
news.
Ifyou have never played a com
bat flight simulator before, dont 
buy the game.Youll feel ex
tremely lost and bored.
The same goes for you folks 
who like constant shoot em up 
action.EF2000 delivers plenty but 
you have to be very patient to see 
it.
For those of you like me, on the 
other hand, who like complex 
simulations, this game is the 
goods!
The very best graphics a flight 
simulator may have are here in
cluding options that will make 
you cry for joy. Missions are as 
realistic as you can get and the 
campaign mode is so unique, 
youll never play the same mis
sion the same way.
Networking is also available 
for combat missions making this 
game a must-buy for the experi
enced combat sim gamer.
Now lets get literally down to 
earth and talk about Demolition 
Derby.
This game is pure fun. Like the 
name says all you do is go into 
races where the winner is the last 
car still functioning.
Youre given a normal car which 
youll use to run normal everyday 
races in, but beware: in these 
races, the objective is to crash 
into your opponent and knock 
him out of the race. Whether you 
come in first or second doesnt 
matter.
The races vary in length as you 
continue throughout the Cham
pionships till you get to the great
est race of them all, The Demoli
tion Bowl!
The Bowl is a free -for- all derby 
in which every car is put in  
giant pit to duke it out with ev
eryone else.
Believe me, this is the game tp 
get to both have fun and get rid of 
stress.
Just imagine your teachers 
driving the other cars; thats whajt 
I do.
On the bad side, the game 
doesnt offer a lot of options. I
Its simply race after race. Also 
your car is a bit wimpy.
You must practice a bit before 
you really master this game. The 
play control could use a little 
work.
Your fingers will get tired aftei 
constantly switching from forjward to reverse positions all the 
time.
Well, thats it for this week! 
Next time Ill be reviewing th<* 
new games in our glourious arf 
cade.
Until then, have fun and kick 
butt!
J1, 1CC9E Sudden Death e1IreMr9e 0srIr0
By DAN ROSENBERG
Tartan Staffwriter
Sudden Death (Universal, 
Rated R) is not going to win many 
raves from critics, and it certainly 
is not going to win any Oscars. 
And judging from its meager $5 
million opening weekend, it 
doesnt look as though the film is 
going to sell a lot of tickets.
What: pttUu bUha[ 
Director: CUaUg HNhfo 
Company: UuwvUgowhM
Nevertheless, the Jean-Claude 
Van Damme action-thriller does 
provide two solid hours of bigscreen entertainment ----- and
isnt that why we go to movies?
In his latest film, Van Damme 
plays firefighter Darren McCord, 
who remains scarred by the 
memory of a little girl he was 
unable to save several years ago. 
He finds a chance for redemp
tion, however, when he has the 
opportunity to defeat terrorist 
Joshua Foss (played by Powers 
Boothe), who has taken control of 
the Luxury Box at the Pittsburgh 
Civic Arena during the final game 
of the Stanley Cup finals. One of 
the hostages is the Vice Presi
dent.
Unless large sums of money 
are placed in separate bank ac
counts before the end of the game, 
pass will detonate a series of 
'tombs that are planted througho -t the arena. Adding to the sus
pense is the fact that McCords 
two children are among those in 
attendance at the sold-out sportir-gevent.
As the thin plot progresses, the 
number of bodies and of punches 
ncrease. There are two fights in 
the stadiums kitchen; a woman 
dressed as the Penguins mascot 
attacks McCord with a meat 
slicer; and several corpses are 
found in the zamboni. Far
fetched? You bet. Boring? Not at 
all.
Basically, Sudden Death is Die 
Hard in a hockey arena, but its 
still enjoyable. The Emmy-winrung Boothe steals several scenes 
as the devilish Foss and director
Peter Hyams (who crafted2010 
and Van Dammes Timecop) 
performs his job well.
The film is produced by Pen
guins owner Howard Baldwin, 
who gave permission for the 
team to appear in the film (al
though gameplay is limited) 
and allowed the stadiums dome 
to be opened for the exciting 
climax, adding a sliver of au
thenticity to an otherwise un
realistic film.
Sudden Death is an unorigi
nal film that isnt going to be 
the next Forrest Gump( in terms 
of box office success or critical 
acclaim), but it certainly wont 
put its audience to sleep.

Vitapup busts out of New York scene
By NEIL DONNELLY
Tartan Staffwriter
.Usually, having no press mate
rial to rely on while writing a 
record review would be enough to 
vnake this critic wake up scream
ing in a cold sweat. However, in 
the case of Vitapups An Hour 
Witli Vitapup, it turned out to be 
a blessing in disguise. With a 
very spare, text-only, black-onwhite cover design and no press 
kit, the music had to speak for 
itself.
Who: lwahKK 
What: nu HEg ywa[ 
lwahKK 
Label: CMfK iUIEgto
And it does (usually quite 
loudly). On this album, Vitapup 
prove that they could very well be 
a force to be reckoned with if they 
are.given enough time to mature. 
Stylistically, these folks definitely 
do not pigeonhole themselves into 
a single genre. They do every
thing from F ugazi-esque emo-core 
to earthy, organic hip-hop, and 
they do it all with remarkable 
pUpU;;:While their songs are quite pow
erful, occasionally the band resQtif to lyrics that are righteous 
anct. overly political. However, 
lyrical adeptness should roll out 
tlie red carpet for Vitapup if they 
dtnrt try to capitalize on their 
talent too quickly.
"An Hour With Vitapup opens 
with Burger King, a blast of 
hardcore somewhat reminiscent 
of Unwound in its unusual, dis
cordant approach to punk rock. 
Freedom For Saturn is very 
grove-oriented, but theres 
enough going on musically to keep 
things interesting.
'.City Soul juxtaposes a desire 
fqr T;he cosmos with the harsh 
reality of city life. Musically, it
sounds a bit like Sonic Youths 
Kim Gordon reading beat poetry 
over a Beastie Boys instrumen
tal. A slightly off-kilter beat domi
nates I Need It, a quiet-to-loud 
anthem that ends with a repeated 
wail of Im alive; they couldnt 
be more right.
The tone is changed dramati
cally, but not abruptly, with 
Blast Off With A Verse, a funky 
hip-hop tune that is executed 
unbelievably well.
The lyrics are clever (Im so far 
underground I got dirt in my hair 
... Ive been doing this since Def 
Jam labels were burgundy) and 
best of all, the backing music is 
completely live.
No sampling or scratching 
here, kids, this is the real deal. 
Rock The Bells is a short, jazzy 
vehicle for more coffee-shop po
etry, but Dragonfly resumes the 
rock n roll energy. On tracks like 
this, the band sounds somewhat 
similar to the late Sunny Day 
Real Estate, but Vitapup pulls it 
off with much more power and 
ferocity, not to mention musician
ship.
Disbelief continues in the 
funk vein with its furious drums 
and propulsive bass line, while 
Come Through is an exercise in 
restraint and release.
The lyrics seem somewhat 
trite, though, as they mention 
430years of slavery andpeople 
in chains. Not to say that sla
very isnt an important issue; its 
just that there are more creative 
and less clich ways of dealing 
with it.
However, the apex of Vitapups 
political pomposity is reached on 
Build Your Own House. A soul
ful female voice croons over city 
noises, but the lyrics sound too 
much like a teenage exorcism of 
high-school angst (Laws are 
about money, not me or you, why 
should we do what they tell us
to?)
Also, references to the O.J. 
Simpson trial are going to make 
this tune seem very dated within 
a year at most.
Vitapup rapidly redeems itself, 
however, with Sports Car, an
other of those short punk blasts 
that they pull off so excellently. 
Odyssey puts brushes to good 
use on the drums, and a healthy 
helping of noise makes this cut 
all the more interesting.
Percussion (including bongos 
and what sounds like silverware 
on glass bottles) comprises the 
brief I. W.T.L.W.W.W.L. Staple 
In The Son finds the band plug
ging back in, but unlike the rest 
of this albums harder songs, it 
becomes bogged down in its own 
repetition (primarily because of 
the tiresome four-note bass line.)
The nearly a cappella I For
got is an interesting change, and 
a toe-tapping one at that. The 
lyrics, though, seem a bit repeti
tive by the songs .end. A funky 
chord is struck on Come Through 
(In A Circle) which evokes a 
slight paranoia because, attimes, 
three people are rapping differ
ent lyrics at once. It is a rather 
interesting sonic experiment, 
though, and a successful one, too. 
The record closes with an un
listed live instrumental track that 
wraps things up on a very mellow 
note.
An Hour With Vitapup is testa
ment to the fact that Vitapup 
should be a band to watch in the 
not-so-distant future. While the 
lyrics at times leave something to 
be desired, they show amazingly 
high potential to be a very impor
tant band (that is, if the corpo
rate-alternative machine doesnt 
chew them up and spit them out 
first). If they are allowed a chance 
to develop further, Vitapup could 
have a great future awaiting 
them.
Come teach CSW 
and be the envy of 
all your friends.
(You also get to have fun, 
meet new Eriends, make good money, 
have a great looking resume, 
and make a difference in someone's life !]

.1u9e UrInr, The Apparition 
asmNrw9 1 gurCae9 mM s91urIi
uomic nook uhronicies
By Jason Andracki
With angels flying around 
everywhere, from t-shirts to 
calenders to television specials, 
it is no surprise that this phe
nomenon is turning up in the 
comic book medium. Angel or 
Archangel (whatever hes be
ing called this month) has been 
around for a few decades, but 
the trend Im talking about is 
that of Caliber Comics The Ap
parition and other less super
hero -inspired books like Sand
man and Hellshocli. The Appa
rition, a creation of James 
Pruett (who founded Calibers 
eclectic anthology Negative 
Burn) and artist Gene 
Gonzales, has been around a 
little over a year, starring in 
two one-shots and in the pages 
of Negative Burn.
This month Caliber launches 
The Apparition: Whispered 
Promises, a currently unlim
ited series starring as the an
gel protagonist, Adriel. I ap
plaud Pruett for finding his 
own angel rather than using 
Gabriel or Michael, who al
ready have their own detailed 
histories.
In all The Apparition stories 
someone is in need of a guard
ian angel (like those strange 
signs we sometimes see along 
the highway) and that angel is 
Adriel. In Whispered Promises,
Pruett steps out of his more real
ity-based tales and introduces 
another supernatural character, 
the demon Astaroth. Adriel comes 
in contact with his foe Astaroth 
while protecting Tammie, a 
woman confronting the horrors 
of her childhood.
Besides the beautiful, fully 
painted covers (which arent at
tributed so Ill assume they are 
the work of Gonzales) the tagline 
of Not every childhood holds 
pleasant memories. Not every
C[EaE "EgaUoN Ed swI[UhUM GhNtEo 
y[woKUgUt CgEfwoUo is h tale of 
the anger and betrayal of a broken 
trust and lost innocence.
memory is easily forgotten, is 
what drew me to the title. Magi
cal tales of childhood, like those 
weaved in The Books of Magic are 
some of my favorite comic stories. 
However, since The Apparition is 
set in reality rather than a world 
of golems and Faeries, these sto
ries are more disturbing. While I 
may envy Tim Hunters magical 
childhood, I do not envy the char
acters in The Apparition who 
are trying to overcome years of 
abuse and addiction with the 
help of some divine interven
tion.
Although the main character 
of the book is an angel, The 
Apparition deserves a spot next 
to The Tale of One Bad Rat and 
Andrew Vachsss Hard Looks, 
not only because of quality but 
also content.
These books serve another 
purpose other than entertain
ment; they inform their audi
ence that the world is not full of 
superheroes but we have our 
share of villains. The victims of 
these villains should not feel 
guilty about the crimes com
mitted against them. It is 
societys duty to defeat these 
villains and protect the victims, 
because we dont live in Me
tropolis or Gotham City.
I read comics, just as I watch 
movies, as a form of escape. 
Regretfully only in our worlds 
of escape are the good and evil 
as clearly defined as hot and 
cold and the wicked are pun
ished rather than set free by illfitting gloves or Miranda laws. 
While Spider-Man may be fight
ing clones, the real villains that 
need to be defeated are racism, 
apathy, and violence.
The mainstream comics 
should take a step in the direc
tion of The Apparition to com
bat these wrongs in a small but 
effective way.
Jason Andracki is a junior 
professional writing major. He 
is angry that the English de
partment once again did not 
offer the Serious Comics course.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  22 January 1996Lll
Las Vegas leaves lasting impression
By APRIL C.MOATE
Tartan Staff writer
Very rarely do I see a movie 
that I can say nothing bad about. 
Fortunately, every once in a while 
a gem such as Leaving Las Vegas 
comes along and happily stars 
such a worthy actor as Nicholas 
Cage.
What: Leaving Las Vegas 
Director: swmU Owwo 
Company: sGsUn
Leaving Las Vegas is the bit
tersweet (but mostly bitter) tale 
of Ben Sanderson (Cage) a oncepromising, now washed-up Hol
lywood screenwriter. He is left 
alone after losing his wife and 
son, and in his desperation de
cides to go to Las Vegas to drink 
himself to death. While there, he 
meets Sera (played by Elizabeth
Shue), a prostitute whom he of
fers $500 to spend the night with 
him. Back in Bens seedy hotel 
room, he does not desire sex, just 
that Sera will stay and talk. The 
two of them develop a relation
ship and eventually fall in love. 
He moves in with her and the two 
accept each others lifestyles, 
knowing that they probably dont 
have much time.
The movie is written and di
rected by Mike Figgis, who has 
produced a rare piece of cinematic 
genius. The script is fresh and 
the cinematography, especially 
in the beginning, is extraordi
nary. Figgis effectively captures 
Bens downward spiral and Seras 
trek along beside him. The mu
sic, a string of sad jazz tunes 
originally composed by Figgis and 
performed by Sting, is a melan
choly backdrop to the images on 
the screen. Some of the songs
recur, making them all the more 
haunting.
Leaving Las Vegas has already 
won several Golden Globe Award 
nominations. Ive always been a 
big Nicholas Cage fan, and it is 
great to finally see him in a movie 
that is critically acclaimed as well 
as award winning. He is one of 
those actors who is usually better 
than the movie that hes in. He is 
also one of the best actors in Hol
lywood today, and his perfor
mance in this movie is undoubt
edly Oscar-worthy. He has to act 
drunk for the entire movie, and 
hes very convincing, partly be
cause he takes a subtle approach 
rather than overdoing it by try
ing too hard. Also giving a stellar 
performance is Elizabeth Shue, 
proving herself as a mature and 
gifted actress. The pain Sera lives 
with is evident simply in the 
subtle expressions on her face,
making her performance unex
pectedly heartbreaking.
If there is any justice in the 
world, this movie will not be over
looked by the Academy of Moti on 
Picture of Arts and Sciences. How'-  
ever, the subject matter isso drl? ' 
and the lack of a happy, Holly
wood ending may make the Acad
emy look the other way towards 
happier, safer movies like Sense 1 
and Sensibility and The Ameri
can President.
To add to the sadness of the'7 
story, the author upon whose bqolt'  
the movie is based, John OBrien; 
committed suicide just days after 
he optioned the rights to the movie 
company.
Admittedly, Leaving Las Ve
gas will not leave you with a 
warm, fuzzy feeling in your hearf. * 
Yet it is such a work of art that tb 
see it is a nearly breathtaking 
experience.
Willis better than a barrel of monkeys
By DAVID KORAN
Tartan Staffwriter
A bit of darkness, a solo accor
dion, and ghostly titles allow us 
to once again enter the rather 
spectacular world that inhabits 
the mind of Terry Gilliam.
What: 12 Monkeys 
Director: RUggN GwMMwhf 
Company:UuwvUgohM CwIagUo
In his latest bit of strange and 
fascinating eye candy, the former 
animator for Monty Python 
brings us into a stark and grim 
view of the future after a devas
tating virus plagues the Earth in 
1996 and wipes out all but one 
percent of mankind.
Our hero, James Cole (Bruce 
Willis), is selected as a volun
teer to make a collecting trip to 
the surface from the under
ground, semi-sterile society 
where the remaining humans 
reside. Upon completion of his 
trip, the ruling members of the 
remaining humans allow for Cole 
to gain a full pardon by going on 
another trip for them ... back in 
time.
While on his first stint back in 
time, in 1990 Baltimore, MD, Cole, 
meets up with Dr. Kathryn Railly
(Madeleine Stowe) when he is 
admitted as a patient to the Bal
timore Countys mental facility. 
She becomes enamored with him 
due to a vague deja-vu idea of 
having met him somewhere be
fore, thus beginning the cycle of 
believing Coles apocalyptic pre
diction of the coming of The 
Army of the Twelve Monkeys.
While admitted, Cole also meets 
up with a rather spastic mental 
patient, Jeffrey Goines (well 
played by Brad Pitt), who also 
believes the predictions, although 
he later becomes inevitably in
tertwined with the on-coming 
apocalypse.Upon Coles re-inser
tion back into time, this time in 
1996, he finally gains informa
tion that may help the scientists 
prevent, or at least cure, the vi
rus in the future.
Cole begins to lose faith in his 
abilities and begins to question 
himself as to whats real and what 
isnt, confusing his, at first un
willing compadre, Dr. Railly, who 
as a psychologist, tries to help 
him cope.
With several twists added at 
the two-thirds point in the film, 
the end begins to level itself out 
to a surprising surrealistic end
ing to humanity and the charac
ters involved.
After having seen all of
Gilliams past films, rangingfrom 
Brazil (which I believe to be a 
prehistory of this one) to the

Fisher King, I believe that visu
ally and story-wise, this one takes 
the cake. It provides the viewer 
with images which, like Coles 
memories, will remain until that 
possible fateful end of 1996.
Provided for enjoyment along 
with the cinematography is a 
haunting score by Paul

Pm,L9se captivates Point Park audience

Tartan Staffwriter
One of the hard parts about 
being a theatre critic  other 
than the occasional nightmare 
that involves the lead actor from 
that production of I Hate Ham
let you loathed so much chas
ing you down a dark alley and, 
when he finally has you cor
nered, stuffing copies of your 
review down your throat 
screaming, Eat it! Eat it! Eat 
it! until you run out of breath 
 is that when you see a par
ticularly good production, you 
are often left with little to say. 
Thats why critics love to hate
things; it gives them more to 
write about.
Unfortunately for me, the Point 
Park College production of Neil 
Simons Lost in Yonkers was ex
cellent.
The play chronicles the nine 
months or so that two boys, Jay 
and Arty, spend living in their 
grandmothers house while their 
father travels around the coun
try trying to build up his savings 
account to pay back a loan shark. 
Grandma Kurnitz is every 
grandchilds nightmare. She is 
cold, unfeeling, and angry at the 
world, having suffered as a child 
in Germany before escaping to 
the United States.
Living with her is the child-like 
Aunt Bella, whose mental sim
plicity counters an emotional com
plexity that is gradually brought 
to the surface as she finds herself 
fighting for an adults indepen
dence.
After her first two minutes on 
stage, the guy sitting next to me 
muttered, She belongs in a strait 
jacket, a comment I found ironic 
since my only problem with Robin 
Walshs performance as Bella is 
that she occasionally fell into pe
riods of physical quiescence that 
didnt quite seem to fit the char
acter.
Also finding his way into 
Grandmas apartment is Uncle
Louie, a tough guy whose exact 
career choice is ambiguous, but 
quite obviously not on the level.
Except for the shaky, sitcomesque ending, Simons play is a 
truly wonderful piece of writ
ing with several complex and 
fully developed characters who 
come away from this time with 
each other having learned 
something about their relatives 
and the depths of human com
passion.
The highlight of this produc
tion is Vaughn A. 
Challingsworth as Jay, the 
older of the two brothers.
Although the acting was solid 
overall, everyone seemed to 
have at least one occasional 
problem: Ryan Calderhead as 
Arty tended to close himself off 
from the audience and his lis
tening was inconsistent; 
Audrey Castracane as 
Grandma was terrifying, but 
her emotional transitions were 
a bit unconvincing; Bill Mott as 
Louie took the clich Mafioso 
hit-man routine a little too far.
But Challingsworth had ev
erything together. From his 
physical movements to his vo
cal choices and transitions, I 
trusted and believed everything 
he did and never saw him at 
work.
We saw everyone else act. We 
saw Challingsworth be. Most of 
all, he served the text of a very 
funny and touching play, well 
staged by director John Amplas 
and the Point Park crew.

American Graffiti
Remember the fifties? Bobby socks? Poodle 
skirts? Malts? Ever have a malt? It tastes like a 
malted milk ball, a.k.a. a Whopper. Whoppers are 
pretty good. I like them. I havent had them in a 
while.
See, George Lucas directs this wundermovie about coming of age in the land of Cor
vettes, ducks ass haircuts, and Whoppers. Star| ring Richard Dreyfuss (whos getting big, by the 
j way, but dont tell anyone I told you), little Ronny 
. Howard and the Hurricanes, Harrison Ford, and 
Howling Wolf. See, what happened is George 
made this movie that kind of bombed, but its 
really good. It also has Suzanne Sommers in it, 
who is also getting kind of big, but in the right 
way.
At 6, 8,10pm, and midnight.
Friday, January 26
To Die For
Nicole Kidman and her entire fluffy ward
robe star in this little ditty about a weatherwoman with a little too much of a high pressure 
system. Its a true story, and in it Nikki kills her 
husband, bops a teenage boy with a bad harelip, 
and makes goo-goo eyes at the nerd guy from 
Jurrassic Park. I got a kick out of this one, and so 
should you.
Otherwise, thats about all I have to say 
about it. The only thing I noticed, and I men
tioned this before, is that Kidman wears a differ
ent outfit in every scene. I mean were talking 
completely different. None of those kids clothes 
with the little animals on them that you could use 
to mix and match colors with other colors and not 
make your kid look like a color-blind dork. Nope. 
She wears 50 or 60 different, distinct outfits. If 
this movie were Showgirls, Nicole would have to 
wear the outfits. Shed just wear different types of 
leather. Thats something to see in itself, so why 
go anywhere else on Friday night?
At 6, 8,10pm, and midnight.
Saturday, January 27
Indiana Jones and the Last 
Crusade
This one is about Indy and his whip. He 
has to save the Holy Grail from the grabby hands 
of Hitler, and all that wee-wah kind of stuff. 
Pretty good, if you ask me. Whats really cool is 
this one scene where a mean German guy turns 
into a nasty, crusty- age creature and blows away 
into dust.
Now if this movie were Showgirls, Indy 
wouldnt quite be pure'enough to grab the Holy 
Grail, and his dad, Sean Connery, would be a 
sleazy bar-owner who makes accidents in his 
pants. Also, the girl in the movie, whoever she 
was, would be in kinky chains while they fell out 
f airplanes and escaped falling rock temples.
At 5, 7:30,10pm, and 12:30am.
Sunday, January 28
Toxic Avenger
Oh, dear. This one is a hoot. See, theres 
this nerd (where isnt there?) who is picked on by 
these big guys who put him in a vat of toxic stuff. 
Then he runs around with a mop and kills people 
who enjoy toxic stuff. Not a lot of meat here, but 
there sure is a lot of corn.
This movie spawned an unsuccessful series 
f action figures. They did fairly poorly, as did a 
cartoon, I think. In general, this a klinker klassik 
that will keep you koming back for more.
At 6, 8,10pm, and midnight.
