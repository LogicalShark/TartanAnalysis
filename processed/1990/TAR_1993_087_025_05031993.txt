Well Endowed Society formed
By THE SUMERIAN
Voluol Vme= 4/3
Ten students from various majors and organi
zations are banding together to form the first 
Student Senate recognized organization for a 
common physical trait. All men with penises 
larger than nine inches in length are being 
invited by junior materials sciences major 
Herbert Long to join the Well Endowed Society 
(WES).
We got em, and were proud of them, said 
Long of his manhood. Were sick of being mis
treated and discriminated against, and were out 
to tell the world to suck our... problems that we 
just cant deal with anymore.
Oel Hung Man, a Senior Mechanical engineer
ing major, is the founder and president ofWES.
We have long ignored the needs and the rights 
of people with excess penile tissue, said Oel. We 
even have a PC [politically correct] term for it 
now  phallically enabled. We deserve recogni
tion from the University and the students who 
all have been disciminating against us.
As reported last week [3/26 Big men on cam
pus shut out of opportunities,] men with large 
penises at CMU were found by a Human Rela
tions Commision (HjRC) report to be discrimi
nated against in areas of employments and fi
nancial aid. President Robert Mehrabian re
sponded to the accusations by changing the state
ment of assurance to reflect that some depart
ments do discriminate on the basis of penis size, 
and that the HRC was working on punishing 
those parts of the University responsible 
Get them wieners, he reportedly said.

Freshmen flunk out
By THE SUMERIAN
Voluol Vme= 4/3
2,512 CMU freshman are eithertransferringinto differentuniversities or drop
ping out of school due to failing grades, 
according to the latest numbers from the 
registrars office. We would say regis
trars /bbIim=n except that since the regis
trar has to share a floor with Student 
Affairs, all they have are two rooms the 
size of Morewood quads and a photo
copier. So its office, singular. Mean
while, Mehrabian has a reception room 
the size of the gym (with a big carpet and 
a seven-foot painting of Andrew 
Carnegie.) Just gotta impress them trust
ees, dont we?
It was horrible, said Mickey Mosler, 
a freshman biology major, who failed 
Principles of Economics, Philosophic 
Methods and Theory, and Introduction 
to Professional and Technical Writing. 
Where was the biology? I was forced at 
gunpoint by my advisor to take all this 
H&LessStress stuff, none of which Ill 
ever use in my life.
I take issue with that, said 
Myxolodian Masters, a freshman history/english double major who failed 
Intermediate Optics, a science core 
course. I dont have less stress; Im 
taking all the same courses you are! By 
the way, I did mean to say that with a
semi-colon in it, you know. Really I did. 
No, no editorinserted the thing in there. 
Masters then proceeded to attack Mosler 
with his very thick Western Civilisation 
book, only to be squashed by Moslers 
Calculus text.
Shirley Eujest, one of four female ECE 
major in the world, said, CMU sucks, 
quite simply. My advisor told me to take 
some really huge course now. Im a fresh
man, cant I balance out my studies with 
other things and not have to take seven 
or eight maths? Oh, by the way, my 
name is an elaborate pun.
About eight CMU students, who are 
not bourgeois middle-class scum, are 
leaving because they can no longer af
ford the high tuition. $17 Gs! said 
freshman dramat MisteE, in a perfor
mance art piece entitled ?/:pl ohhtc 
rmumf 17 Gs and the gym sucks! 17 Gs 
and no college interaction!
The forty-or-so freshman remaining 
include a group of quintuplets from a 
small village in Indonesia majoring in 
CS, one Kenyan in the ROTC program 
(who has made no comment about his 
sexual orientation), thirty music majors 
who were originally rejected from Bos
ton University and Julliard, and a smat
tering of Mexicans who are getting class 
credit for doing Phys Plant jobs at 
cheaper wages than would domestic 
union workers.

37 protestors were arrested by 
Campus Police a couple of days 
ago as they chained themselves 
to bulldozers preparing the site 
of the new University Center.
According to police reports, 
which The Natrat reproduces 
faithfully as articles, including 
even minor error like grammati
cal mistakes, the protestors, call
ing themselves Students for the 
Modernization of Unique Recre
ational Facilities (SMURF), 
blocked the construction vehicles 
from doing whatever it is that 
construction vehicles do. They 
push dirt around, 
mostly. Construc
tion vehicles, I 
mean, not protest
ors. That would be 
stupid.
The students, 
carrying large or
ange signs that 
read End Con
struction and 
Free Kittens occupied the con
struction site for approximately 
three hours. Vince the IC is si
lent Knoodle, leader of SMURF, 
declined to talk to The Natrat on 
camera.
When informed that The 
Natrats reporter was not a rep
resentative of any of the major 
Pittsburgh television stations, 
and thus had no camera, even 
though the reporters hair eo= 
practically perfect, Knoodle is
sued a statement.
I dont know. We were sitting 
around the commune the other 
day trying to think of a good cause 
to fight for, said Knoodle. I 
mean, all the really good ones are 
takenSEI, WTI, SDI, the FBI, 
RBIs... His voice trailed off. 
Knoodle trailed after it. The 
Natrat caught up with him as he 
chased it across Schenley Park.
So anyway, Bob was reading 
the P/=lv4oTmllm ____________
a pretty good cause. So, here we 
are.
Reginald P. Firthwirthy III, 
first senior executive vice presi
dent in charge of Creating Really 
Long Job Descriptions, Holding 
Fancy Tea Parties, and Requisi
tioning Garbage Bags was the 
only person in Warner Hall will
ing to return The Natrats phone 
calls. Firthwirthy said Theyre a 
bunch of overgrown hippies. I 
mean, come on guys, put away 
the love beads, enoughs enough. 
Go join the Flat Earth Society, or 
the Klan, or the College Republi
cans or something. This part is 
just between you and me, okay?
So, heres my official state
ment. We certainly have listened 
to the opinions of the campus 
community very carefully. Weve 
debated the pluses and minuses. 
Weve weighed the pros and cons. 
We ran it up the flag pole and saw 
who saluted. We bounced it off 
the wall to see if it would stick. 
Why, just the other day I was in 
an important meeting with Presi
dent Mehrabian, Dean Murphy, 
Provost Christiano, and a lot of 
other people whose names I like 
to drop.
The bottom line is this: weve 
decided to wait until Skibo Hall 
falls down. I mean, whats the 
rush? Youve waited ten years for 
a new student union, whats an
other few months? Representa
tives of The Student Union could 
not be reached for comment. Well, 
okay, they probably could have 
been. But their office is like, a 
whole three doors down from The
Natrat, and frankly, it wasnt 
worth the effort.
CIT Senator Shirley Blimfark, 
one of three female sophomores 
in an engineering program at 
Carnegie Mellon, said I think 
its ridiculous that the Univer
sity Center is being delayed again. 
Were paying $20,000 a year to 
come to this school. Well, not me, 
my parents. And the bank. 
Somebodys paying it. I think that 
its our responsiblity as students 
to whine, Im paying $20,000 a 
year whenever any little thing 
goes wrong around here, and I 
intend to do so at any opportu
nity.
Its clear that Skibo is archi
tecturally significant as a repre
sentative ofthe early-sixties jun
ior high school/municipal build
ing type of building design, said 
Arthur Miller Van Der Rohe, a 
professor of architecture and 
drama. But I must admit its 
ugly and totally useless as any
thing besides a large repository 
for cockroaches.
On the other hand, its not like 
CMU students deserve someplace 
nice where they can relax and 
have a social life. I know that if 
we let them, theyd all join clubs 
that meet during University free 
time, form meaningful relation
ships, and get to bed at a reason
able hour. Theyre slackers. Thats 
why my students have to run 
around the College of Fine Arts 
building with carpet tacks in their 
shoes at 4:00 am every morning. 
Its about time that they learned 
to suffer for their art.
Why, just the other day I was in an impor
tant meeting with President Mehrabian, Dean 
Murphy, Provost Christiano, and a lot of other 
people whose names I like to drop.
 VP Reginald P. Firthwirthy
and it said they 
were tearing down 
Skibo Hall, and 
they called it a 
campus landmark, 
and I was really 
surprised, cause 
Bob usually only 
reads The Family 
Circus and Marmaduke, but he ap
parently stumbled 
upon the news sec
tion. And I said to 
myself, Self, thats

Shuttle ejects 
toilet facilities 
while in orbit
DEEP SPACE, April 31 (DJ)NASA 
announced Thursday that a malfunc
tion in the Space Shuttles delicate 1970s 
technology caused the entire plumbing 
system of the shuttle ?I=i/muc to be 
accidentally jettisonned when a crew 
member pushed a prettty red button.
NASA said that they would deal with 
the problem in the future by training 
astronauts to appreciate no aesthetic 
pleasures.
Ve vas chust following orders, said 
Helmut van Clibum, commander of the 
German-sponsored shuttle expidition. 
Dere vas a beeg red botton next to the 
Floosh key, und dat dumkopf Amerikanner pooshed da wrong von after he 
splatted his sausage.
Hey man, like, chill, said Buzz 
Sherman, the crewman who was respon
sible for dropping the excrement. Like, 
in all probability, dude, the shitll just 
bum up in the atmosphere, and the 
whole hemispherell just smell like Oak
land for a few hours or something.
Michael Murphy, unnamed NASA of
ficial, declined to comment on the par
ticulars of the left-behind lavatoiy, but 
did say, I think that, after saying this 
about that, the entire problem is some
thing that we can handle together, and 
that we best move on with our other 
priorities and goals and put this aside as 
a minor setback.
Yellow rain falls 
on Pittsburgh
PITTSBURGH, April 31 (AP)  A 
sickly, yellow rain descended onto the 
streets of Pittsburgh late Thursday af
ternoon, making the entire city smell 
like a dry fish.
I have analyzed the precipitate that 
fell today, said Michael Murphy, direc
tor of the OSHA (I dunno what it stands 
for either) institute downtown, and I 
can definitely say that its organic in 
origin, and has a saline quality to it. It 
must have come from some animal, and 
was not a product of the machines high 
in orbit above Pittsburgh that create 
what the citizens of Pittsburgh believe 
is just bad weather. Thats all off the 
record, okay?
Groundsworkers at Carnegie Mellon 
Unversity reportedly threw up their 
arms and cheered as they saw the rain 
falling. Now we dont have to spread 
shit on the ground, said Michael 
Murphy, a gardener with CMUs Physi
cal Plant. Its falling from the sky!
Officials at NASA wearing big black 
masks denied any connection between
the Pittsburgh weather and the loss of 
plumbing control in the space shittle

David Koresh rises after three 
days in ashes
WACO, TEXAS, April 31 (DJ)David 
Koresh proved that he was some kind of 
a messiah after rising up, with a com
plete human body, a set of Hardees 
Smurf glasses, and dressed in a big 
technicolor dreamcoat.
I have arisen, come to take you to 
the..., Koresh was reported as saying 
before he was gunned down by the fortyfive ATF agents with really big guns.
I dont think that he was really the 
Messiah, said Michael Murphy, a rep
resentative of the FBI. He didnt have 
the spiffy beard that Jesus did. Also, he 
wasnt black. Jesus has soul like nobody 
else, Hes gotta be black.
Shortly after Koresh was gunned 
down, God reportedly appeared in the 
sky and declared the ATF agents to be 
infidels and struck them down with a 
large plasticflyswatter. It was not known 
for certain if the ATF agents were headed 
for purgatory or directly to hell.
It is not known at this time if this was 
the Christian God, the Jewish God, Al
lah, or some other entity. Representa
tives of God were not available for com
ment.
Koresh reportedly rose again after the 
ATF agents were sent to their destiny. 
Pickingup alarge gun and a supermodel, 
Koresh posed for poster shots before 
embarking on a successful film career.
Clinton caught 
using slang
PITTSBURGH, May 1 (SK)  Presi
dent Billy Boy Clinton, while visiting 
Pittsburgh yesterday, was overheard 
saying yinz to First Lady Hillary. 
Rodham Clinton and White House Com
munications Director George Stephanopoulos while entering Allegheny 
County Courthouse, aides said.
At an emergency press conference held 
today, Stephanopoulos stated, The 
White House would like to officially dis
pel these rumors.... What the President 
actually said to Mrs. Clinton and myself 
was yens.... We were discussing the 
trade deficit.
Leading conservatives Robert Dole and 
William F. Buckley, Jr., agree that this 
will prove a worse blow to the public 
opinion of the Executive Branch than 
the potatoe incident with former VicePresident Dan Quayle.
Popular conservative commentator 
Rush Limbaugh capitalized on the slip 
immediately, saying, Either he used 
Pittsburghese or he used an incorrect 
plural of a Japanese word... an obvious 
sign that [Clinton] is more biased than 
he and his ... liberal fans would have us 
believe.
Castration ruled 
reasonable 
punishment
WASHINGTON, May 1 (SK)  The 
Supreme Court today announced its 
unanimous ruling that castration does 
not constitute cruel or unusual punish
ment in cases of theft, and that usage of 
the technique is left to the discretion of 
the states.
Several activist organizations across 
the country, most notably Men as a Mis
treated Minority for Good Treatment 
(MMM-GOOD), and the Carnegie Mellon 
Mens Center, have already begun letter-writing campaigns to state legisla
tures advising against the procedure.
Michael Murphy, a certified 100 per
cent male and representative of MMMGOOD, was present at a press confer
ence, and spoke to reporters. Said 
Murphy, I think that, after saying this 
about that, the entire problem is some
thing that we can handle together, and 
that we best move on with our other 
priorities and goals and put this aside as 
a minor setback.

Voluol Vme= 4/3
The University admin
istration, in an attempt 
to make money off of a 
profitless dining service, 
has now rennovated High

Student Senators were 
offered real food in a 
psuedo-Greco-Roman set
ting. Also, analysts were 
brought in to ensure the 
food was worth six dol
lars.
In order to pay for the 
new facility, CMDS has 
created a new charge

the $4 million construc
tion costs. Students are 
now charged a block meal 
each time they enter a dor

4/25 MEDICAL ESCORT,
9:53 pm. A student reported that 
while clipping his toenails he had 
cut one nail too short. The stu
dent feared that unless some
thing was done soon, the toenail 
in question could become ingrown. The student was escorted 
to Presbyterian Hospital.
4/25 DISTURBANCE, 11:31 
pm. WRCTs station manager 
phoned campus police to report 
that three disgruntled WKCT D Js 
had barricaded themselves inside 
of the station and refused to 
emerge until their message of 
continuous REM, Van Halen, 
and Julio Iglaesias was broad
cast to the student body. The sta
tion manager feared that if this 
messagewas broadcast, it might 
cast a negative view of the sta
tion to the rest of the students. 
Campus police promptly stormed 
the station in riot gear and ar
rested the three students, who 
hadironically dubbed themselves 
the Arrested Students.

4/28 NUISANCE, 4:37 pm. An 
employee of Salads Plus notified 
campus police that a student had 
illegally parked a large yellow 
Caterpillar bulldozer in the Tar
tan Grill smoking section and left 
it unattended. The employee also 
noted that the bulldozer was still 
running and therefore a nuisance 
to other students. Police arrived 
and discovered that the bulldozer
in question had, in fact, been 
driven through the glass wall of 
the Tartan Grill overlooking the 
tennis courts and had stalled at
tempting to get through the turn
stiles to Salads Plus. The student 
driver could not be located, though 
an internal citation was left on 
the seat.
CA[x THEFT, 12:51 pm. 
Deklewa Construction, general 
contractor for the University ten
nis court rotation project, alerted 
campus police that one yellow 
Caterpillar bulldozer had been 
missing from the tennis court 
destruction site for two days.
4/30 DISORDERLY CON
DUCT, 1:26 pm. Campus police 
responded to a report of a univer

the fence. The employee, who had 
reportedly just auctioned off his 
clothes to a class in order to prove 
a point about making an offer 
you cant refuse, was issued an 
internal citation and ordered to 
return to his office.
4/30 MEDICAL ESCORT,
6:04 pm. Campus police re
sponded to a request for an escort 
to Shadyside Hospital. Upon ar
riving, campus police discovered 
that a student had glued his eyes 
shut. Police noted this was the 
third time this year that this par
ticular student had done this and 
promptly refused transportation 
to Shadyside because three times 
is enough!
4/31 LLAMA, 3 am. Three 
CMU llamas were arrested by
campus llama pollamaice for 
allamaegedly spitting at passing 
peopllamas. A Natrat editor was 
found dead llater in the backseat 
of a Chrysler Llebaron, with two

Senators Absent: There usu
ally are, arent there?
Approval of the Minutes: 
Minutes? What minutes? You 
mean we were supposed to spend 
this ten minutes reading last 
weeks minutes? I went to the 
Yard to get a hot dog, what do you 
want out of me?
Audience Participation: Eric 
Alderman read his letter to the 
editor of the Natrat, after paus
ing to wipe some viscous sub
stance off the paper. The letter 
expressed Aldermans discontent 
with life in general, and as a form 
of protest, he killed himself with 
a rolled-up sheet of newsprint, as 
a symbol of the damaging influ
ence of uneducated media.
Ex-Officio Reports:
Greek Council (Kristian 
Barefoot): I would say some
thing, but The Natrat is running 
out of jokes and cant libel greeks 
without getting their asses fried, 
so Ill shut up now.
Faculty Senate (Dean 
Murphee): Faculty Senate has 
insituted a Tar & Feather your 
University President event for 
Freshman orientation next year. 
If you would like to participate, 
please contact myself or Jay 
Kadane. And my first name isnt 
Dean, is it? Its Michael. So how 
come everybody else has their 
first names listed, and I have my 
stinking title listed?
Student Affairs (Tim 
Fosterchild): Next years inter
national festival is in the plan
ning stages, and well have food 
and entertainment from the is
land nation of Genosha. If youve 
never heard ofit before, well thats 
called diversity. Please, please, 
please consider giving IF a small, 
itty-bitty special allocation.
SDC (AimeePotholder):The
Properties Committee will be 
buying equipment and evaluat
ing pool tables. I cant believe I 
actually said that in my report 
once. an66a BmruoMIo:VIsrl= will 
play this Saturday at 5:45, 8:10, 
10:10 pm, 12:20 am.
President (Natalie Gesmund): Since Gregg wont give 
me the funding I want, Im going 
to sit here and hold my breath 
until I get all my funding, like Im 
not sick enough as it is.
Treasurer: There is presently 
no treasurer, there will not be a 
treasurer next week, and by the 
Grace ofGod well probably never 
have another treasurer again in 
the world as we know it!
Committee Reports:
Academic Affairs (Yaman 
Fadel): AA is working on im
proving the spelling skills of cer
tain clerical staff on The Natrat 
and on Senate so they can spell 
my name right. Also everyone is 
failing out, so enrollment for next 
year is down by 63 percent. Ask 
Davidian for info on how this af
fects us. Also, Faculty Senate is 
doing more stuff without asking 
us again.
Campus Affairs (Bert 
Wholzman): We will be intro
ducing in special business a spe
cial allocation to the Poster-policy 
Management and Supervision 
(PMS) people to purchase flame
throwers forthe expedient cleans
ing of bulletin boards and policy 
violators. Also were planning to 
turn all the bike racks into sexual 
torture devices at the request of 
President Mehrabian.
Funding and Recognition 
(Davidian Martinique): Enroll
ment is down by 63 percent, and 
that happens to be the number of 
students who bother to pay their 
activities fee, and since Im not 
running for re-election, Im going 
to kill my self with this large blunt 
can of Diet Coke from Genosha I 
found in Greggs dresser drawer.
Human Resources (Ann 
Copchick): Suicide rates are 
going way up on campus for some 
reason. If youre interested in 
starting a student counseling ser
vice, please see me.
Public Relations (Sean 
Knight): What am I doing in 
these fake minutes? I resigned, 
for Christs sake. This is really 
unfair to Jim, too. Take me out, 
Kendrick. Now. I really mean it. 
Ok, you wanna see traffic on 
Morewood get really bad, buddy? 
You just leave me in here befo
Chair (Gregg Haveacow): 
We have too many vacancies on 
Senate now, and were about to 
have one more, because now that
Davidian has ruinedmy complete 
collection of Diet Cokes Im going 
to kill myself with the gavel. No

CIT constituent James Hit 
me! Brown proposed a resolu
tion to act against discrimination 
against people with large penises.
Whereas the majority of CMU 
students, being geekly and un
manly, have penises which are 
between 1 inch and 4 inches in 
length when fully erect 
Whereas penises at CMU 
longer than 5 inches are a rarity 
Whereas the HRC has clearly 
demonstrated that those with 
large penises have been discrimi
nated against in areas of campus 
service employment, research 
grants, and sex with another con
senting adult 
Whereas the old resolution con
cerning penis size is full of gross 
implausibilities and inaccuracies 
that Brown is too chicken to come 
right out and print 
Be it resolved that Student Sen
ate condemns the administration 
for its unwanton and unwar
ranted discrimination against 
people with large penises 
Be it further resolved that this 
resolution also apply to women 
with penises, who are even a fur
ther minority at CMU
 Motion to call the previous 
question fails 6-12
 Motion to call the previous 
question fails 7-11
 Motion to call the previous 
question fails 810
 Motion to call the previous 
question fails 9-9
 Motion to call the previous 
question passes 10-8
 Resolution fails 10-8
New Business: none.
Points of Discussion:
Issues discussed included 
poster policy, vacancies on Sen
ate, and Natalie turning blue. 
Also, all Senators got up and 
stopped playing dead, because 
death isnt funny.
Meeting adjourned at 2 am.

Natrat censors news, 
political viewpoints
Editor:
One would think 
that at a place of 
higher education re- Letter tO
* Editor
taught. Alas, I find again that this is not 
the case with The Natrat. It has come to 
my attention that the Fool Em Editor 
has been editing letters, claiming that 
space considerations forced him to do so.
I find this self-appointed censor atti
tude to be a common element at The 
Natrat. It appears to be a pre-requisite 
to be a member of the board.
Of course, no one should be surprised. 
The precident to prohibit the dissemina
tion of certain information has been a 
major theme in The Natrats style of 
reporting. As we all know, however, no 
one would admit to it.
Take, for example the issue concemThe Edito
rial Board saw fit to not obtain the opin
ions of those who had the
most contact with the
group under investigation.
Also, what about the way Dean of 
Student Sexual Affairs Michael Murphy 
handled the incident at
the fraternity? Surely the
campus community has the right to know 
that used his position as
to murder BHHBHH 
and hide the disappearance as a simple 
expulsion.
The student body has a right to know 
aboutthesethings. To appointitselfas a 
filter shows The Natrat to have higher, 
questionable political motives. This 
should be kept in mind when they come 
up for funding.
Ive also listed several other incidents 
where The Natrat limited viewpoints, 
mispresented information, or otherwise 
distorted facts. Depsite the probability 
that the Fool Em Editor will cut them, I 
will list them anyway:
 The fight between the fraternities 
over who had hipper music
 The debate in Senate over the
question of who had a bigger penis, 
Senator or ExComm
member Himi
 The embezzlement of money by 
Natrat editorH^I^^HI in the 
amount ofHNMHM^I
I ask that The Natrat explain this 
behavior.

letters a lot. We wont tell you his 
name, but he used to be a SCS 
Senator.)

Libertarian rants and raves 
about trivial crap
real problem is that single mothers cant 
raise their sons. Thats why males ac
count for almost all of the violent crimi
nals in jail. These girls cant teach a boy 
what it means to be a man. When I try to 
say that, however, you bitches try to 
censor me. Sure, you think youre hot 
shit, but wait until your repressive phi
losophy makes it legal for cops to come 
into my home for playing my own type of 
music. Shit, theyll even arrest me for 
rape simply because the woman looked 
at me in such a way that it meant no, 
even though she didnt say no when she 
should have done so because you have to 
be direct and not pull any of this date 
rape shit that allows women to sue a 
man or get him thrown in jail because he 
didnt call her the next day or buy her 
the car she wanted because women think 
that they can control mens sexuality 
and they cant because when we see 
women we just go out of control despite 
the fact that feminazis try to use the 
argument about homosexuals not going 
out of control. Thats because homosexu
ality is perverse since it doesnt perpetu
ate the species and I dont know how any 
normal, virile man could get turned on 
by some other guys dick, unless, of 
course, he was raisedby his single mother 
because we all know that only men can 
raise men.

The Natrat  Carnegie Mellon  3 May 1993
Code of conduct will improve life
Harry Richard
The priorities of most CMU stu
dents are radically out of joint, 
and for the moral good of the 
whole campus, a new code of con
duct must be initiated immedi
ately.
First of all, a degree in extra
curricular activities should be
come the most prestigious and 
impressive degree offered by the 
University. There is no need to 
concentrate on changing core re
quirements for colleges or mak
ing sure that you have enough 
units to graduate.
Instead the course catalog 
should be one big electives sec
tion with wonderful classes in 
basket weaving, how to set your 
VCR, and in-depth workshops on 
how to smoke a cigarette, chew 
bubblegum, and carry on a con
versation all at the same time.
For the first time, the needs of 
individual students would really 
be the top priority. For our friends 
from the more arctic climates, we 
should have classes such as sun
bathing 101 with special empha
sis on the proper method of put
ting suntan lotion on the already 
perspiring body of some member 
of the opposite sex. This, of course, 
would be one of the only classes to 
have homework involved, and due 
to the importance of the class, the 
lotion and pink fuzzy beach towel 
would be supplied by the book
store free of charge.
For our friends from the sun
nier climates we can have courses 
in snowball-making, how to prop
erly make a snow angel without 
becoming romantically attached 
to her, and obviously the 200 level 
course Snow sculptures melt, so 
whats the point  A study in 
duality.
The Student Senate meetings 
would be replaced by the weekly 
flogging of professors who do not 
score at least a three on the bi
weekly evaluations. Students 
would really learn about the aero
dynamics of rotten fruit and veg
etables as they fly through the 
air in the post-flogging adorn
ment of such professors.
There should be classes taught 
on the best ways to enjoy cheap 
movies and cartoons. Students 
will develop their skills by watch
ing countless hours of the madefor-cable smut version of The 
Toxic Avenger and by analyzing 
it in relation to the social impact 
of Ren and Stimpy and Speed
Racer.
Students would gain an under
standing of commerce by indi
vidually replacing every desk in 
the University with one of those 
chair/bed things on the first floor 
of the library that everyone pre
tends to study on. Sunglasses and 
a neck brace would be required 
for every class so that the profes
sor could no longer tell who is 
sleeping in class by the closed 
eyes and randomly . bobbing
oughly publicizing pictures of the 
student so that the sex life of the 
individual would be permantly 
ruined and he would have to re
sort to dating Pitt women.
There should be a year round 
Carnival that covers the entire 
Morewood parking lot. In addi
tion to the familiar booths and 
rides, there should be a Miss Nude 
Carnival Queen pageant. Despite 
her nakedness, the most impor
tant categories forjudging should
There should be one year round carni
val that covers the entire Morewood 
parking lot. In addition to the familiar 
booths and rides, there should be a 
Miss Nude Carnival Queen pageant.
heads.
Brown-nosing would be the only 
offense punishable by the Uni
versity. As always, deterrence by 
way of extreme punishment is 
the best way to deal with such 
obscene behavior, so instead of 
expulsion, the accused student 
would have to stand naked on the 
Cut on a cold day so that all 
available body parts, are shrunk 
to the smallest possible size. Af
terwards, a special committee 
would be responsible for thor
be poise, character, and the abil
ity to stand for eight hours in 
spiked high heel shoes.
A stricter policy about frater
nity buggy spying would be en
forced so that if any member of a 
fraternity even looks at another 
fraternitys buggy before the com
petition, he will have to spend a 
night in DH 2210 with his eyelids 
taped open, forced to listen to a 
Vivarin-high philosophy profes
sor explaining why we know we 
exist.
A new committee on proper 
dress would be formed so that all

Crabby Schiftless (CS): Because I am 
feeling even more repressed than usual 
today, I almost didnt write this column. I 
was ready to forget, if not forgive, The 
Natrats crimes against womynhood, most 
notably the phallic size of the pages (longer 
than they are wide, with piercing, invasive 
points at each comer  as though there 
were a law against gender-neutral, round 
pages.) But then I remembered the inane 
large penis running joke, which almost 
made me yak my breakfast all over the 
life-sized poster of Hillary Rodham Clinton 
that adorns my wall. Resteefo, you 
chauvanist pig, you practically made me 
into a bulimic, dominant male societyworshipping IilIW who pukes all over the 
President of the United States! I cast away 
my Midol; lrI= Wmo:= eouz
Resteefo-Suave (RS): Crabby, you igno
rant slut, its unwashed feminazis like you 
who seek to destroy the very moral fiber of
our country. Christ, youre the ones who 
want those quota-pushing bills like the 
ERA passed. Hell, you think you can just 
get pregnant and still come back to your 
job as a professional football player de
spite the fact that youre out of shape and 
the fact that men are stronger than women.
If youre upset about the penis thing, it 
oniy goes to show that womyn are too lazy 
to stop watching soap operas and eating 
bon-bons and get up off the couch and get 
involved in things. Sheesh! Myn have to 
be so =m:=IlIm these days. Even offering 
woman free change from your pockets for 
lunch (which I would imagine to be a 
charitable act) can offend someone.
CS: Resteefo, I would agree completely 
if you werent a brutish, aggressive, testosterone-dripping example of what can 
happen when a Y chromosome enters into 
the picture. The penis-size joke is more 
telling than it is humorous, distinguish
ing you Natrat men from magnificent 
hunks of manflesh like, say, A1 Gorgeous. 
Does the word pencil mean anything to 
you, Resteefo doll?
RS: Oh, yeah, like anyone can believe 
the arguments made by a person whose 
sanity comes and goes monthly. Must be 
that time again for you. And as for focus
ing on the body, how come womyn always 
talk about the pain of childbirth. It seems 
that even five year-olds are doing now, 
despite the fact they dont even know 
what the hell theyre talking about. Face 
it, womyn are built to have children. Deal 
with it.
CS: Ah, Resteefo, your crazed rantings 
remind me of this guy I knew once; his 
idea of mynhood seemed to depend on how 
many times he could gape at my proudly 
gorillian legs and guffaw, Hey, isnt it 
about time you dragged a uoT/u over those 
puppies? (Wait a minute, that wasyow!)
Contrary to what you grunt, womyn are 
built not only to bear children but also to 
*)eat myn over the genital area with large, 
olunt instruments. Especially snotty 
Natrat columnists  snotty Wotm Natrat 
columnists, that is.
RS: There you go again, you yeast-infected wench with undersized breasts. 
You unshaven feminazis are intent only 
on destroying myn. Look at the facts. 
Youve installed a womyn as a shadow 
President who controls the every action of 
her slave. In your perfect world, Amazo
nian tyrants woulduse myn only as breed
ers for their sperm. Why dont you tell the 
truth? We know that the womyns health 
movement actually desires to build up 
massive sperm banks so that they can 
eliminate men and then selectively pro
duce more womynmore unshaven femi
nist womyn, that is.
CS: By Hillary, youve discovered our 
plan! There c/) s/ again, you mammaryobsessed patriarch, getting off on bizarr6 
sexual fantasies of your own subjection. 
Being a myn, you dont know what its
umottc like to walk down the street, a 
veritable magnet for drooling, malodor
ous male geeks who think that their bared, 
hairy, 200 pound beer gut is attractive to 
da ladies. In fact, minus the beer gut and 
25 percent of the B.O., Id say youre quite 
familiar with the male side of this very 
situation.
And now, Im going to find a blunt object 
and a sperm-collection receptacle. Youd 
better be here when I get back.
RS: Go ahead and fling your degrading, 
inciteful, divisive comments where you 
may, you tampon-comsuming beast who 
destroys the environment with multitudes 
of feminine hygiene products. But before 
you go, answer me this: If womyn are truly 
independent minded people just as ca
pable as men who dont want to be treated 
as petite, delicate flowers, why is that the 
comestics industry is so large? Why do you 
cry for equality and then bitch when a 
myn doesnt hold the door open for you. 
Sure, you want equality  but only if 
youre more equal than the myn who sup
posedly oppress you and your kind.

His equipment is just too big!
Star recruit dismissed from basketball team, lawsuit to begin
By MIKE HUNT-HERTZ
Voluol jhhm:3osm k3Il/u
After much deliberation, Carnegie 
Mellon Universitys mens basketball 
coach, Tony Wingen and his coaching 
staff, have decided to dismiss their star 
recruit, but it has landed the university 
in court.
Joey Meat Buttafuocco [no relation 
to the infamous husband of Mary Jo], 
the New York High School player of the 
year, and McDonalds All-American se
lection, had turned down offers from the 
University of North Carolina, Michigan, 
and Duke in his desire to attend CMU.
Ive always wanted to wear the ma
roon and white of the Tartans. Their 
program stands head and shoulders 
above the others, and coach Wingen 
promised me the opportunity to start as 
a freshman when none of the other 
coaches would, said Buttafuocco.
But all that has come to a bitter stand
still. Buttafuocco has been cut from the 
Tartans, but not because of a lack of 
talent. The problem is one never docu
mented before in the world of college 
basketball. His penis is too big to stay in 
his shorts. It constantly falls out and 
causes a danger to both himself and 
others. And that is the problem which 
has caused all this controversy.
Yesterday, Coach Wingen released an 
offical statement explaining the posi
tion of the athletic department. Here are 
some excerpts of that statement.
As coach of the Carnegie Mellon Uni
versity mens basketball team, I feel it 
would be in the best interest and safety 
of the student body if Joey Buttafuocco 
was deemed ineligible to participate as a 
member of the basketball team. In the 
two weeks of unoffical practices, I have 
had an opportunity to see Meat in ac
tion. While he is by far the most talented 
player Ive ever seen, his abnormally 
large penis has become a great concern 
of ours. His equipment is just too big. It 
keeps falling out of his shorts and lays 
on the court. A number of my players 
have tripped over it, or twisted ankles 
trying to avoid it. I cant allow my other 
stars, particularly Charlie Connors and 
Derek Dragisich, to get injured. We have 
tried different ways of containing his 
penis. For example, a pair of shorts with 
a large inside pocket was devised. That 
was unsuccessful. Another idea was to 
wrap it around his waist, but it kept 
coming undone. So, as all of you can see, 
we have exhausted all options short of a 
surgical procedure.
Buttafuocco will have nothing to do 
with a surgical procedure. The NAMBP 
(National Association for Men with Big 
Penises) has taken up his cause. Alaywer 
has been appointed to help Buttafuocco 
sue the university and athletic depart
ment into allowing him to participate on
informed personal, opinion on the issue. 
I had a very similar problem, but my 
doctor was able to construct a harness 
which allowed me to keep my penis off 
the floor. It wont work for Joey because 
his penis is just too big. Mine was big, 
but not that big! saidRonzio.Plus, with 
him out of the picture, I have a better 
chance of getting some playing time.
With all the national attention this 
event is getting, it was no surprise when 
Buttafuocco received a call from Mike 
Tyson, the former heavyweight cham
pion.
He assured me there were other guys 
out there with the same penis problem. 
Also, to stay away from all Miss Black 
America contestants, said Buttafuocco.

the mens team.
The case will be tied up in legal 
bureacratic red tape for quite some time. 
In the meantime, a judge has ruled that 
Buttafuocco will be allowed to compete 
in the interim on the co-ed naked la
crosse team, (see story below).
Most of the basketball players are 
happy with the ruling. I think JoejjjB a 
nice guy but it was murder playing 
against him. I didnt want to step on his 
penis or have it hit me on a drive to the 
basket. Every time he turned and faced 
the basket,I would have to dive out of the 
way, said Kevin Byrne.

Skibo gymnasium siege ends in 
fire on second day of takeover
By JESUS H. CHRIST
Voluol L)tl k3Il/u
Yesterday, a religious sports cult 
took over the Skibo gymnasium, and 
threatened to bum the athletic com
plex down if their demands were not 
met.
Coming so soon after the fiery end 
in Waco, many in the Carnegie Mel
lon student community responded 
with disbelieve and horror.
After about five minutes, the mood 
changed to one of joy and jubilation. 
Screams of Bum it down, bum it 
down could be heard all over campus. 
Students brought cans of gasoline and 
firewood to Tech Street in hopes of 
assisting the cult members.
Sports Information Director Bruce 
Gerson and the coaching staff ad
dressed the cult members and students. 
Skibo gymnasium has been ready for 
the wrecking ball for some time now. 
Burning it down would be an effective 
way to demolish this disgusting 
sweathole where we are forced to work 
everyday.
The cult members, realizing their 
demands would not be met, joined the 
students and staff bum the place to the 
ground.
President Mehrabian was quoted by 
WPXIs John Fedko saying, How could 
they bum my gym down? It was one of 
the finest buildings on campus. We 
hadnt planned on replacing it for at 
least another fifty years or so.

By DON T. KETCHUM
Voluol omtI: k3Il/u
A quiet afternoon dance practice was violently interrupted on 
Tuesday when freshman Marty Wicks javelin throw soared out of 
Gesiing Stadium, with tragic results.
Two sophomore dance majors, CarlinRomano and Sylvia Scribner, 
were killed when Wicks javelin impaled them during an outdoor 
practice for the upcoming Dancers Symposium.
If there can be a positive side to this tragedy, sports information 
director Brace Gerson said, Wick set a new school record with his 
throw of 275 feet, 6 inches.
Witnesses reported that the javelin just soared from.the sky, like 
a giant penis, according to a dancer who asked not to be identified.
Mens track coach Gary Meckley announced that from now on, 
javelin throws would be aimed in the other direction, towards the 
Skibo end of Gesiing Stadium.. Had this been the case on Tuesday, 
Wicks throw would have clattered harmlessly off the rattrap of a 
student union.
Wick, visibly shaken after the meet, said he wanted to issue a 
public apology to the dancers families.
Ill be the first to admit I dont like dancing, but I never meant for 
this to happen, he said. This is tragic, simply tragic. I wish I could 
somehow make this up to their families. For now, I can just say Im 
sorry. But that wont bring them back.
The Tartans did win the meet, 108-100 over Case Western Re
serve University. Ironically, Wicks throw provided the winning 
points. The Tartans record improves to 8-2 on the season, placing 
them second in the University Athletic Association. No criminal 
charges were filed against the athlete.

The Carnegie Mellon Co-ed Naked Lacrosse team will make its 
debut in the fall, CMU Athletic Director Dr. John Harvey an
nounced Wednesday. The team, which will compete in the Univer
sity Athletic Association, will have full varsity status as a fall sport.
We think the team has great drawing potential, Harvey said. 
We already have had a lot of interested participants asking about 
tryouts. And season ticket sales are ranging into the thousands. 
Harvey said a coach had not yet been named, but the athletic 
department has had several applications. A nation-wide search is 
being planned.
Former basketball star Joey Meat Buttafuocco has announced 
he will play for the team. Harvey took one look at Buttafuocco 
during tryouts, and promptly declared him team captain.

never have a chance to use it. You 
wont catch a disease playingwith 
yourself.Aftercollecting sugges
tions from people who have expe
rienced past attempts of Sex Week 
and meeting together to discuss 
the suggestions, SDC has decided 
that teaching and enlightening
people about sex if the only thing 
they experience is onanism.
Says Scott Curtin,  Its a well 
known fact that nobody at CMU 
is involved in sexual activity. Lets 
face it were all too damn re
pressed. Therefore, SDC is re
vamping the whole thing. We 
want to accomplish  and we 
know this wont be easy  our 
own little sexual revolution. We 
want the uptight students on 
this campus to get laid, says 
Curtin. Curtin also said,  We 
think we have just the right ac
tivities to do it.
The opening activity will be a

Listen up scum, your mothers

be good to have your type in this

you shoot yourself in the foot to 
get discharged and get a job as a

Well, everybody the world over 
knows of the United States  
except those who don'tand for 
some, the States has the reputa
tion of a promised land. A land 
whose very streets are paved with 
gold
(I dont know much about 
metalurgy but I never realized 
that gold looked like an alcoholic 
and regularly panhandeled for 
quarters).
Coming to CMU was the 
completion of a life long dream, I 
had the brains and the good for
tune to be able escape the despair 
in my country and come to a new 
land.
But I was not prepared for the 
culture shock that awaited me, 
how was I supposed to move from 
my third-world country to the 
first world without any layover 
in any second world countries?
My experience of course is not 
unique, most of us Canadians find 
the transition hard  from say
ing zed to zee, from a colourful 
(colorful in the American spell
ing) form of currency to bland 
repetitive green (the authour has 
lost at least fifty dollours giving 
people tens instead of ones) and 
worst of all having to change from 
Molsens Canadian to Molsens 
Canadian Export.
Living down the stereotypes 
probably has been the worst  
not ALL Canadians watch 
hockey, say the word eh, wear 
toques and perform great in bed 
 admittedly Ive never met any 
that dont, and if you know any I 
will give them a good 
thrashing...bloody freaks. Also I 
have been upset by Americans 
lack of sensitivity  Canada is 
NOT the fifty-first state! Actu
ally America is the eleventh
through sixtieth provinces of 
Canada.
Do you know what else makes 
me believe that Canadians are 
morally superior to Americans?! 
... pssst ... theyre gone ... two 
simple facts: one, no American 
can read beyond the second para
graph of a newspaper article, two, 
Canadians on the other hand will 
faithfully read anything that has 
been written about them.
What this means is that any
one who has read to this point in 
this article must be a Canadian, 
thus we can now discuss our plans 
for world domination openly.
The plan is this: Prime Minis
ter Brian Mulroney will be stand

the next NAFTA confrence, a

out and Clinton will fall dead into 
the Prime Ministers arms. Our 
scientists have been working on 
the speech for years  it will be 
short but impassioned and 
Mulroney will be swept into the 
presidency with powers that will 
make Marshall Law look like an
archy.
We shall annex the upper states 
and the rest will secede to Mexico, 
the fat bloated American pigs will 
never know what hit them  if 
they think their taxes are high

 1986 Mark Martin (this one's for real, guys)
Cold and Empty. Empty as a Thunderbird bottle on a park bench."  
Gnatrat
[Ed. Note: This is for real. We mean it. Really.]
The Gnatrat feels quite cold and empty these days. Cold and empty becaust 
hes spent so much time out of the superhero business, andhis identity as Boc 
Swain is just not bringing in the good comics business. But where is th< 
Gnatrat? And will he conquer the industry to once again bring a quality comil 
book to the newsstand? Or will he whither away and dissappear, like ths 
rodent he is.
Mark Martin published in 1986 a parody of The Dark Knight Returns 
distributed by Prelude Graphics and exported from Canada. The only reasor 
we mention the thingnow is that our parody issue is calledNatrat, and it musi 
be some mother of a coincidence (or non-coincidence) that nobody discovered 
the thing as of yet.
In a world of animals, the Gnatrat must track down an evil gang of artvillians who are subverting the comics world into emotionless claptrap. Along 
the way Gnatrat kills many, many people and cracks enough wise to pul 
Spiderman to shame.
Anyway, the thing is hilarious if you are a fan of Batman and bought the 
original Dark Knight, pretty funny if you like Batman and DC comics, 
amusing if you like comics in general, prerty boring if you dont like comics, 
downright insulting if you are a fan of good literature, and not at all funny ii 
you are a slobbering fanboy who cant take a joke.

By The Sumerian
Amy Fisher and Joey 
Buttafuoco
 w/smlrmu jsoI:n R)l V/l E: 
Rm3
Well, three television movies 
about their story wasnt enough 
for Joey Buttafuoco and Amy 
Fisher. His lawyers talked to her 
lawyers, and they collaborated 
on the album entitled, w/smlrmu 
jsoI:n R)l V/l E: Rm3z
This ground-breaking album 
devotes one side to Joey rapping 
his side of the story and the other 
side to Amy singing her side in 
the style of a Broadway diva.
Joey exhibits his finest hip-hop 
moves andlyrics on his side ofthe 
album. (Yes, folks, he does make 
all those strange noises himself, 
using various body parts and ori
fices). The song, By The Time E 
Met That Amy Fisher, opens up 
a whole new area for rap music, 
the rap ballad. Joey soulfully 
sings his heart out over a thump
ing beat.
He takes off with Wife Killer 
as he continues to deny his in
volvement with Amy and her plot 
to kill his wife; all of this is set to
a house-shaking beat. Joey puts 
his all into Do The Butta-fuoco, 
which is creating a dance craze 
that is sweeping the nation. Fans 
everywhere are mimicing part of 
the chorus, Hey, Mary Jo!
The influence of Andrew Lloyd 
Webber and Broadway musicals 
is apparent from the first track 
on Amys side of the album. You 
can almost see her with her hair 
pulled back like Eva Peron in 
Lloyd Webbers musical, kIloz 
Those voice lessons really paid 
off.
On the track, Another Court
room, Another Jail, Amy pours 
her heart out to the audience. 
Her power to convey the sadness 
that she feels through her voice is 
unbelievable. But Dont Cry For 
Me Long Island is the real tour 
de force of Amys side of the al
bum.
Forfans ofpop culture, w/smlrmu 
jsoI:n R)l V/l E: Rm3 is an al
bum that simply cannot be passed 
up. Where else can you get rapstyle and Broadway show tunes 
on one album?
