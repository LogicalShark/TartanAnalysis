Agents from the Department of De
fense (DoD) Inspector Generals office 
presented Carnegie Mellon University 
President Robert Mehrabian with a sub
poena last Tuesday. The subpoena re
quests all University documents per
taining to any DoD contracts or grants 
with CMU since July 1,1986.
Provost Paul Christiano says the 
amount of paperwork pertaining to the 
subject is enormous. Weve had approxi
mately 140 of these [contracts and 
grants] over the past year, said 
Christiano. Over the years theyre ask
ing for there must have been at least 
1,000. In terms of the amount of paper 
theyre asking for, were talking about 
millions of pages.
The provost says the investigators 
have not told the University why they 
are requestingthe documents. We have 
been in contact with the investigators to 
try to understand a little better what[Women protest sexual violenceTake Back The Night' march attracts 900

in support of the event.
Prior to the demonstration, a

By FRANK MICHELS
goinoA frmt hDsnpi
On Tuesday, Student Senate passed a resolution 
by a vote of 18-24 that would increase the per
centage of the Graduate Activities Fee that the 
Graduate Student Organization (GSO) receives 
from 37 percent to 60 percent in the next two years. 
The resolution was proposed by the Funding & 
Recognition Committee but was drafted by a group 
of five undergraduate and three graduate stu
dents.
The resolution recommends to the Board of Trust
ees that the Graduate Student Activities Fee gets 
redirected such that 60 percent of the activities fee 
is allocated to GSO and 40 percent is allocated to 
Student Senate. Half of this change is to take effect 
in the fall semester of1994, and the remaining half 
is to take effect in the fall semester of 1995.
Currently, Student Senate receives 67 percent of
the Graduate Activities Fee, but, according to the 
proposal, only 40 percent of that money is spent by 
Student Senate on graduate students. This figure 
was based on the percentage of graduate students 
that participated in organizations and events 
funded by Student Senate.
The current split in the Graduate Activities Fee 
reflected the amount of graduate participation in 
activities funding by Student Senate several years 
ago. However, it was found that the current gradu
ate student participation in Senate-funded events 
and participation in GSO-funded events did not 
reflect the current participation levels.
Lara Wolfson, president of GSO, was one of the 
graduate students who helped draft this proposal. 
She said that with some of the organizations, the 
groups best judgement was used. With small 
organizations, we got input from the leaders of 
those organizations about graduate participation,"

Christiano. Were trying to do every
thing we can to help them.
The agent in charge of the case, Spe
cial Agent James Hagen of the DoDs 
Philadelphia office, refused to talk about 
the nature of the investigation. We have 
a policy of not commenting on ongoing 
investigations, said Hagen.
A source close to the DoD who asked 
not to be identified said that the Inspec
tor Generals (IG) office operates totally 
autonomously from the Department. It 
is customary for even the Secretary of 
Defense not to be briefed on investiga
tions conducted by the IG, said the 
source. Investigations should not be 
conducted in public in light of political 
considerations.
The source said that the IG does not 
have to reveal the reason for the sub

Norm Brososky has worked 
for the University for 22 years 
and is currently employed as a 
computer engineer in hardware

Ive been liv

10 years, said 
Brososky. All 
I can say is 
that my aller

Brososky 
says that he 
has been 
treated by his 
doctor for res

a mysterious skin rash over his 
lower arms. He added that a 
number of people who work in 
UCC have sufferedfrom similar 
skin problems. The rash does 
not respond well to treatment, 
said Brososky but will subside 
when hes away from the buildingfor extended periods oftime.
Pete Collopy, director of En
vironmental Health and Safety 
(EH&S), said that UCC has 
suffered from air quality prob
lems since its construction in 
1983.
The building was con
structed in 1983 and 1984 in
ing it, Collopy said, which he 
calls a big mistake.
Not only were occupants ex
posed to environmental hazards 
from the building materials and 
processes, said Collopy, but pol
lutants were able to enter the 
ventilation system. He said that 
because the building was fully 
occupied at the 
end of 1984, that 
the ventilation 
system was never 
fully cleansed of 
these pollutants.

Due to an error in calculating student discounts 
for long-distance calls during the 1991-92 aca
demic year, $34,200 will be distributed between 
the Student Dormitory Council (SDC), Interfraternity Council, and Panhellenic Council for projects 
that would benefit'students.
During the 1991-92 school year, students who 
used AT&T College and University Systems, or

on-campus residents and discussed the possibili

going to be split by the number of residents gov

Panhellenic Council. Based on occupancy, SDC 
will receive $28,522.80, Interfraternity Council 
will receive $4,856.40, and Panhellenic Council 
will receive $820.80.
Scott Curtin, SDC president, said, Instead of a

The error was discovered by AT&T this past 
summer. Although ACUS assumed responsibility 
of the problem, it was not feasible for ACUS and 
CMU to track down these students and calculate 
the three percent difference owed to each one of 
them from all of their individual phone bills.
Mary Pretz-Lawson, head of Telecommunica

said that SDC representatives were asked to go to 
their floors and find out what residents felt. A

can be dropped off to RAs, said LaMonica.
SDCs ideas include a new projector for Doherty

for a number of years, said LaMonica.

IRA bombing claims 10; 
Protestants may retaliate
BELFAST, Northern Ireland, Octo
ber 24 (AP)A woman whose son was 
badly wounded in a bombing is ap
pealing to Roman Catholics and Prot
estants to stop the fighting in North
ern Ireland.
May Harrison says everyone has had 
enough. Ten people were killed and 58 
others wounded when a bomb exploded 
yesterday in Belfast. Two children and 
four women are among the dead.
The Irish Republican Army says it 
was aiming for members of a Protes
tant paramilitary group, but many of 
the victims were shoppers on a busy 
street.
Police say an IRA member was
among those killed, and another man 
whos in a hospital fighting for his life 
is said to be under a heavy police 
guard.
There is growing fear of reprisals by 
Protestants in Belfast following the 
bombing. The outlawed Ulster Defense 
Association has vowed to avenge those 
killed by the explosion.
The Reverend Gerry Reynolds says 
his Catholic parishioners are very 
frightened and fear retaliation.
Residents who live near the scene of 
yesterdays attack wandered through 
the rubble today to lay down bouquets 
of flowers in a farewell gesture to the 
dead.
Newspaper reports errors at hospitals not publicized
PITTSBURGH, October 24 (AP)  
The Jsnnt1iUl JptnC,o9rnnr says fa
tal mistakes involving medicine at hos
pitals often go unpublicized.
As a result, the errors are repeated 
in ignorance at other hospitals, and 
the results are a nightmare. The news
paper says no agency exists to inform 
hospitals about errors in medication 
that have killed patients elsewhere.
In the absence of formal oversight, 
hospitals are on their own to share 
information about errors, but they 
arent likely to do that.
Hospital pharmacists say only a frac
tion of mistakes are reported. A former 
president of the American Society of
Hospital Pharmacists, R. David Ander
son, says hes always been troubled by 
the fact that hospitals dont want to 
talk about their mistakes. He says its 
because hospital administrators want 
to avoid lawsuits.
The JptnC,o9rnnr surveyed ab out 250 
hospital pharmacists across the na
tion. They indicated that an average 
of about 12 medication errors a year 
led to death, disability, or harm at 
each of their hospitals last year.
The JptnC,o9rnnr said 106 patients 
died as a result of those 3,000 errors. 
They say the mistakes often involve 
the same medicines, the same 
misreadings, and the same results.
Gore, optimistic on Haitan peace, says Aristide fit to lead
BRAINTREE, Massachusetts, Oc
tober 24 (AP)  Exiled Haitian Presi
dent Jean-Bertrand Aristide says al
legations that hes mentally unstable 
are nothing but psychological war
fare. He denies a Central Intelligence 
Agency (CIA) report that he was 
treated for manic depression in 1980.
Aristide told a news conference in 
Massachusetts today that he wont 
succumb to pressure to make conces
sions to Haitis military leaders and 
that allegations that hes unfit to gov
ern are garbage. He renewed his call 
for the resignation of the army com
mander. He is supposed to return to 
Haiti by next weekend, but U.S. offi
cials say its unlikely the deadline will 
be met.
Vice President A1 Gore says democ
racy must be restored and Aristide 
returned to office before the United 
States will turn off the pressure on 
Haiti.
Gore told reporters in Washington 
hes cautiously optimistic following 
word of progress in talks with Haitis 
military rulers. He credits renewed 
UnitedNations sanctions forthe move
ment. He says the allegations in the 
CIA briefing on Aristide come from 
opponents of the ousted leader.
But Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole 
disagrees. The Kansas Republican says 
some ofthe allegations against Aristide 
have been corroborated. Dole told re
porters restoring Aristide to powerisnt 
worth one drop of American blood.

Weiner works in a South Philly bar 
where 500 people showed up last night 
to watch the Phillies come from behind, 
only to lose the World Series to the Blue

Hundreds of extra police patrols were

PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, October

man says Haitis first democratically

Diplomats continue to work on a 
new initiative to allow Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide to return by October 30. Thats 
the date set out in an accord signed in 
July by Haitis military leader.
Now, Aristides opponents are de

U.N. spokesman Eric Fait says thats

WASHINGTON, October 22 (AP)  
President Bill Clinton and Russian Presi
dent Boris Yeltsin will hold a summit 
meeting in mid-January as a show of 
U.S. support for the Russian leaders 
struggle to convert the one-time com
munist state into a democracy with a 
free market economy.
The vice presidents going in Decem
ber, and I plan to go in January, Clinton 
told reporters in Washington this morn
ing. But weve got to finalize the date. 
We may do it before the days over, but
by
we dont have a date yet.
In Moscow, a senior U.S. official said 
there would be a formal announcement 
after Secretary of State Warren Christo

country home outside the capital.
Ive been there in January before, 
Clinton added, then joked, Its light 
about four hours a day. It shows you my 
timing.
Vice President A1 Gore will go to Rus

designed to emphasize U.S. support for 
Yeltsins government and also bring at
tention to one of the more successful 
aspects of the administrations foreign 
policy.

WILLIAMSPORT, Pa., October 23 
(AP)  The government is seeking an 
18-month prison term for the first per
son in the nation charged with making a 
false claim about finding a hypodermic 
needle in a Pepsi can.
Assistant U.S. Attorney George 
Rocktashel said he wants to send a strong 
signal to other would-be tamperers.
Twenty-five-year-old Christopher 
Burnette, ofWilliamsport, pleaded guilty 
in July to placing the needle in the can 
himself. He is scheduled to be sentenced 
Tuesday.
Sentencing guidelines call for Burnette 
to be sentenced to between 15 and 21 
months and fined between $3,000 and 
$30,000. Burnettes attorney is seeking 
probation.
The government attorney said a mas
sive recall was averted only because 
Pepsi acted quickly to inform the public 
of what it said was the virtual impossi
bility that a needle could turn up in a 
sealed can.
Rocktashel cited figures from Pepsi 
that estimated the soft-drink manufac
turer lost $40 million in sales during a 
three-day period in June and spent $10 
million to restore public confidence.Three Rivers Stadium may get flashing sign

University receives subpoena from DoD
SUBPOENA, from page 1
source said.
Christiano said that hedoesntwant 
to speculate on the reasons the inves
tigation was launched. Its impor
tant to realize that government audi
tors maintain an office at this Univer
sity, he said. Very often, four or five 
are here at a time.
If theres a difference of opinion 
over how something was handled, or 
if weve made a mistake, he said, 
and it happens from time to time, 
weve resolved it. The government is 
here all the time. We think they un
derstand how and what we do here. 
Naturally,, its very surprising 
when something like this occurs, said 
Christiano, who said that there was 
no advance warning that something 
like this was about to be launched.
The government source said that 
its become fairly common for these 
thing to be done. Its become custom
ary for the IG to take a hard look at 
expenditures of research dollars, he 
said.
He added that the subpoena does 
not necessarily imply illegal activity 
In this country, youre innocent until 
proven guilty, he said. Were not 
even to the point where they have an 
indictment.
Receiving a subpoena in my mind 
does nothing to convince me that there 
has been wrong-doing, said the 
source. They probably just want to 
review documentation and records. 
The issue here is where and how CMU 
has spent their research dollars.
The University's total fiscal year 
1992-93 research budget was $146.7 
million. Of this, about $64.5 million 
was sponsored by the DoD.
The administration is requesting 
that all faculty and staff work with 
the investigators if they are asked to, 
said Christiano.
Weve asked faculty and staff not 
to throw away anything that they 
might normally throw away, he said. 
Be careful not to discard anything, 
whether the documents have existed 
for a long time or if theyre new.
The provost added that anyone who 
is questioned by DoD may ask to have 
the Universitys legal counsel present. 
We would not discourage anyone you 
wanted to speak with, said 
Christiano, but you may ask the 
University to provide the Universitys 
attorney.
Christiano said that the University 
is not required to turn over anything 
until November 12.
After they start to receive the in
formation, maybe theyll see how large 
the magnitude of their request is, he 
said.
The danger that we want to avoid 
is that this would serve as a major 
distraction, he said. Christiano would 
urge all staff members to keep doing 
what theyre doing.
We want to cooperate completely 
with the government, he said. We 
want to be open, and do everything we 
do with the maximum integrity. We 
owe that to all of us, our students, and 
ourselves.
New dean chosen for Heinz
By MARKUS KASSBOHRER
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Effective December* 1, professor Mark 
Kamlet will become dean of the H. John 
Heinz III School of Public Policy and 
Management. He is currently head of 
the Department of Social and Decision 
Sciences (SDS) in H&SS.
Professor Alfred Blumstein, dean of 
the Heinz School since 1986, announced 
his resignation in January. He will stay 
with the school and return to research 
and teaching, building on his strength 
in criminology and modeling.
Kamlet said that he is excited about 
the school that has come a tremendous 
way under professor Blumstein and now 
is one of the premier public policy pro
grams in the country.
He said he was looking forward to the 
opportunity of taking over Heinz in the 
strongest shape it has ever been. In 
particular, he said there was no 
downslide, no problem areas in the cur
riculum, and no need for major financial 
restructuring.
His top priorities, aside from main
taining the Masters and PhD programs, 
will be to carefully but deliberately move 
into new areas. Two examples are a 
program on health policy, an area with 
lots of change and interest to students, 
according to Kamlet, and a program 
dealing with information systems, with 
the data highway and its ramifications 
for service delivery by government, regu
lation, and telecommunications. 
Further, Kamlet said that he wanted 
to build on the very strong group in the 
intersection of economic development 
and labor [at Heinz], both at the high 
end, productivity, and at the low end, 
unemployment.
In pursuing these new directions, 
Kamlet said that links across campus
are key factors, as well as being posi
tive for the upcoming capital drive. Spe
cifically, he thinks of possible coopera
tions with GSIA, H&SS, and CIT, citing 
the example of the joint masters degree 
program with CFA.
Blumstein said some of his major ac
complishments were bringing in a very 
strong faculty and building up the re
search volume. Since Blumstein has been 
dean, the number of research grants to 
Heinz increased from four when he was 
appointed dean to 26, involving almost 
the entire faculty.
According to Blumstein, another im
portant achievement was reinvigorating the Masters program with a curricu
lum revision and a steady improvement 
in the quality of entering students, es
tablishing the joint program with CFA, 
and structuring the doctorate program.
However, Blumstein said, There is 
an area of diminishing returns.... There 
is a need for a new person to address 
areas I neglected. Blumstein also said, 
Being dean at Heinz is extremely de
manding. There are no departments and 
therefore no department heads, [so one] 
has to deal directly with individual fac
ulty.
Blumstein said that Kamlet doesnt 
need advice; he knows the place well. 
Blumstein said that he had been hand
ing off information on the Heinz Schools 
status to Kamlet, particularly the need 
to increase visibility beyond the public 
policy school community, as well as the 
desire to increase outside funding. 
Blumstein said that he felt he had not 
done enough with regard to these two 
issues, and he was delighted to see that 
Kamlet was aggressively moving on 
both of them.
Kamlet, who has a Berkeley doctorate 
in economics with other degrees in math
ematics and statistics, was one of the
first visiting faculty members at Heinz  
school when he joined CMU in 1978.  
Ever since he joined SDS, he has been on  
a joint appointment both there and at  
Heinz, where he has been on the Mas
ters Committee, worked with the CFA 
program, and taught core courses.
Kamlet said that what he brings to the 
position, besides a familiarity with 
Heinz and with the campus at large, 
having been with CMU for 15 years and 
interacted with all the other groups, is 
a wealth of research that integrates well 
with the Heinz School, especially in 
health care.
Provost Paul Christiano said in a memo 
to the campus community, Since as
suming [leadership] of SDS in 1990, 
[Kamlet] has skillfully guided [the SDS] 
department to one that is internation
ally recognized for its unique strengths.
Blumstein said he was looking for
ward to continuing to serve on the schools 
faculty under Kamlets leadership. Per
sonally, he plans to improve his strengths 
in modeling and criminal justice, espe
cially criminal careers and punishment 
policy, which he said has grown exces
sive and counterproductive in the United 
States in the last 20 years.
Kamlet said, One area I would like to 
pursue is establishing a research pro
gram, a post-doctoral training program 
in analysis of dysfunctional behavior 
like crime, mental illness, alcoholism, 
unemployment.
The world is generating a large num
ber of longitudinal data sets that are 
being seriously underused, because it 
demands capabilities on the subject, in 
statistics, computers and modeling, 
Kamlet said. I look forward to working 
together with colleagues in Heinz, Com
puter Science, and possibly GSIA to tap 
this gold mine and do a service to the 
world.UCC residents worried about long-term health effects
UCC, from page 1
that the black dust occupants see 
has been coming out of there 
from day one.
The dirt is not the problem, 
said Brososky, who says that hes 
seen similar particles in other 
buildings in Pittsburgh. I dont 
; know what the problem is, he 
'; said. Maybe its not enough fresh 
! air, I dont know.
Jenny Ladd, network opera; tions technician for Data Com
munications, said, I dont know 
what, if any, of my problems are 
caused by the building versus my 
j allergies.
Ladd said she suffers from 
; asthma. She says that she hasnt 
seen any black particles in her 
office in UCC, but that she knows 
people that have had problems 
with them. All I know is that if I 
; had them dropping on my desk, 
[EH&S] would know about it, 
said Ladd. The last thing I need 
is particles of any kind floating 
around.
Ken Burner, building manager 
of UCC and hardware manager 
for Computing Services, said that 
its hard to say why other build
ings on campus do not have these 
types of air-quality problems. 
Warner Hall and Hamburg Hall 
are also on Forbes Avenue, and 
they dont have this problem; 
Nowhere else on campus do they 
have this problem. UCC is unique 
in that its a sealed building, and 
thats a cause of a lot of the health 
problems.
UCC is the victim of a phenom
enon known as Sick Building 
Syndrome, said Burner. He said 
thatthe buildings occupants have 
complained of headaches, dizzi
ness, scratchy throats, sinus con
gestion, and nausea. Its almost 
universal, he said, and added 
thatthe doctors have verified that 
the complainants were genuinely 
(ill.
Two people had these prob
lems almost daily, until we moved 
them [to a new office] 50 feet 
down the hall, said Burner. Now 
theyre fine. So, were experiencI ing some localized effects as well. 
Whats really weird is that only 
certain people are affected by it, 
said Zeher.
We really dont know whats 
niakingsome people sick, he said.
7 Weve tested for glycol, which is 
part of the air-conditioning sys
tem for the computers, and it was 
not found. We tested for formal
dehyde, too  all the things that
they test for in Sick Building Syn
drome have not been found.
Collopy believes that all of the 
air-distribution problems in UCC 
have been solved. In the early 
days, there was a lack of fresh 
air, and a lack of air circulation, 
and people complained of head
aches and drowsiness, said 
Collopy. Now, he said, the amount 
of fresh air in the building ex
ceeds the current standards.
We can find nothing from a 
contaminant point-of-view that 
would cause these problems, said 
Collopy. We want 100 percent of 
the people in the building to be 
healthy, and its clearly discon
certing that we have the percent
age of unhealthy people that we 
do.
Collopy says that his office is 
looking to see if any part of UCCs 
ventilation system harbors bac
terial growth. Microbe infesta
tion could be the cause of some of 
the maladies the buildings occu
pants have suffered, but none has 
been confirmed yet.
Ladd said that she cannot wear 
contact lenses in the building. I 
would come in this building, and 
my eyes would swell up, she said.
She frequently smells odors 
from the ventilation system in 
the building, Ladd said. I smell 
food odorsburnt popcorn, soup 
arid cigarette smoke. She said 
that she doesnt know where the 
smells come from, but that as a 
result, she has blocked up the 
vent in her office to try to keep 
them out.
Another odor she has smelled 
in the building, said Ladd, is mil
dew, particularly on B level. Its 
not so bad when the air is mov
ing, she said, but when the air 
flow stops....
Ladd said that some days, she 
gets migraine headaches when 
she works in certain areas of the 
building for any length of time. 
One day I came in feeling fine, 
and I came down with one of the 
worst headaches Ive had in 
years, she said;
Half an hour after I left the 
building, I was fine, said Ladd. 
She said that she believes that 
the episode was caused by excess 
carbon monoxide in the air. Ladd 
said that she found out that the 
loading dock doors were open.
I, myself, hadnt had any 
health problems until a few 
months ago when they moved my 
office [to its current location in 
UCC], said Pete Bronder, direc
tor of Data Communications, al
though I had been hearing about 
them for years.
Were all sick to some degree, 
said Donna Donovan, a secretary 
and travel administrator for Com
puting Services. Im under a 
doctors care. He doesnt know 
whats wrong, just that Im suf
fering from a form of anemia. 
Several, people have left the 
University and found jobs else
where because of this problem, 
Donovan said.
Some people refuse to meet 
you here, said John Leong, tech
nical director for Computing Ser
vices, which causes us consider
able problems.
Zeher is one of the people who 
no longer goes to meetings in the 
building. She was moved to an 
office in Hamburg Hall seven 
years ago because she was suffer
ing from health problems she feels 
may have been aggravated by the 
air quality in UCC.
Her first office, said Zeher, was 
in Wean Hall, another sealed 
building.
I worked with the same equip
ment at Wean Hall as I did at 
UCC, said Zeher. Computers, 
printers, toners, everything. I 
never had problems over [at 
Wean].
I basically get sick in [UCC], 
said Zeher. Headaches, nausea, 
you know. But I cant pinpoint 
them all to that building. Zeher 
said that merely entering the 
building makes her sick.
I dont go in there, and I cant 
go back in there, she said. People 
know that I cant go in the build
ing. Zeher says that shes basi
cally isolated at her new office, 
because shes in a different build
ing than many Computing Ser
vices personnel.
Its not like they havent 
thrown money at this, Burner 
said. The University has spent 
substantial amounts of money 
trying to solve the problem. 
Recently, an independent labo
ratory called SE Technologies
evaluated both the buildings 
problems and the steps the Uni
versity has taken to address them. 
Included in the study were exten
sive interviews of building occu
pants, air sampling, and analysis 
of things that CMU has done to 
improve air quality in the past.
The recommendations in the 
SE Technologies report include 
identifying all areas in the build
ing where health problems have 
been a concern, having the 
ductwork and air handling units 
cleaned,' and installing higherefficiency filters.
In addition, the report recom
mends sanitizing any visibly dirty 
areas to retard microbial growth. 
SE Technologies also suggests 
monitoring carbon dioxide levels 
throughout the building to make 
sure the fresh air in UCC is con
stantly up to standards.
The report also mentions poor 
air flow balance in the building 
as a cause of many of the com
plaints. A pressure differential 
in the building may be causing 
fumes and pollutants to be sucked 
through the loading dock doors 
when they are opened.
SE Technologies says that the 
University should reevaluate and 
increase housekeeping and clean
ing procedures in UCC and make 
sure they are followed strenu
ously.
Members of Physical Plant, 
Computing Services, and EH&S, 
including Burner, Collopy, and 
Physical Plant Director Ron 
Carter, have formed a committee 
to evaluate the SE Technologies 
report and oversee its implemen
tation.
Burner says this is the first 
time a committee like this has 
been in place to work on UCCs 
problems.
We have some ideas wed like 
to try, said Burner, but declined 
to speculate on what those ideas 
were.
They have spent so much 
money for experts to come in, 
said Donovan, that they prob
ably could have installed a new 
ventilation system by now.
It seems like they just keep 
doing more testing, saidBronder. 
Bronder says that he and his tech
nicians have suffered fatigue and 
eye strain, which he feels was 
caused by something in UCCs 
air.
Burner said that even if the 
buildings occupants were moved 
to a different building, theres no 
guarantee that the new building 
wouldnt have similar problems. 
Thats not an option. Were try
ing to find a solution to this 
buildings problems.
Its not as simple as putting 
opening windows in UCC, said 
Burner. The air-conditioning 
system was designed for a closed 
building.
[SBS] is one thing, said Leong, 
you have no evidence then. This 
is not ambiguous. These are 
physical things. The filter sys
tem is not working. If it was a 
mysterious problem, thats one 
thing. But this is not a mysteri
ous thing.
No one comes to talk to you, 
Donovan said. They gave us their 
latest report, but you have to be a
scientist to understand it.
I think that one of the prob
lems in the past has been poor 
communication, said Collopy. 
Its important that the informa
tion be communicated to the oc
cupants.
I think a good solution would 
be for people from Physical Plant 
and some of these laboratories to 
come and share an office with us 
for a few months, said Donovan, 
but every time Ive suggested 
that they havent taken me seri
ously.
I love my job, said Brososky, 
I love the people I work with. I 
hope to retire from the Univer
sity. But, goddamnit, I dont want 
to retire in an iron lung or [with] 
an oxygen mask.
I think Warner Hall needs to 
get involved, said Zeher. Its a 
shame. No one knows about the 
long-term health effects [of work
ing in UCC].
Bronder said that some build
ing occupants have considered 
going to the federal government 
or to media outlets. If they do not 
solve this internally, said 
Bronder, this is going to esca
late.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  25 October 19935
Crime and Incident Report
10/15 PYROTECHNICS,
10:26 am. While four SafeWalk 
personnel were walking in front 
0f Donner Hall, they heard an 
explosion in the Hill dorm drive
way and saw blue smoke coming 
from the hillside on the south end 
0f Scobell Hall. The SafeWalk 
irew immediately ran up to 
gcobell Hall at which time they 
discovered a one-liter plastic Coke 
bottle blown up with several 
pieces of burnt newspaper nearby. 
lOne of the students saw a white 
^ale, wearing a dark T-shirt, 
looking out the thiril floor fire 
'escape door. When (he student 
realized that the individual was 
looking at him, he dicked out of 
sight. The reporting officer 
checked the hallways inside 
Scobell Hall for any tipe of explo
sive materials or unusual behav
ior, with negative -.results. No 
damage was done to'CMU prop
erty.
10/16 INCIDENT, 11:21 pm. 
A student from the University of 
Pittsburgh contacSed Campus 
Police and said thit he had an 
email conversation with some
one who said that ne had cut his 
wrist in the past and was again 
considering suidde by possibly 
jumping off a bridge. The student 
Said that the peison claimed to be 
a student at Duke University but 
was staying vith a student at 
;CMU. A responding officer re
sponded to th2 dorm room of the 
CMU studert, but she said she 
does not knew that person and 
that no one ras staying with her 
that weekend. She did say that 
her roommate had a boyfriend 
with the sane first name as the 
student wto sent email. Her 
roommate was not in at the time.
At 1:30 am the roommate con
tacted Campus Police and told a 
dispatcher that she did not know 
anyone by the nairie of the person 
who sent email.
: 10/17 MEDICAI ,12:31 am. A 
student called Campus Police and 
said that there THE a person in 
his room that had :iallen and was 
unresponsive. The victim had 
come to the student's room and 
said that he was feeling sick and 
had a severe healache. The stu
dent was in the bathroom and 
when he came oit, he found him 
lying on the floo*.
Student EMS vas on the scene 
upon arrival of lesponding units. 
Student EMS requested that City 
Medics be notified. The victim 
was transported to Shadyside 
Hospital.
Prior to the transport, the vic
tim became somewhat respon
sive, and it was discovered that 
he was taking the medication 
Indersol for severe headaches.
10/17 FIGHT, 12:59 am. A stu
dent called Campus Police from 
the fraternity emergency phone 
stating that there was a fight in 
progress at a fraternitys patio. 
All units responded, at which time 
the fight was over, and both com
batants were separated and sent 
on their way. One of the combat
ants approached an officer and 
said that while he was working 
the entrance door to his frater
nity, a brother from another fra
ternity began fighting with an
other student. He attempted to 
break up the fight by stepping 
between the two fighters, but then 
the outside student turned and 
punched him in the right eye and 
nose. Both the student and a wit
ness said that the fighter has on 
several prior occasions tried to 
crash parties, which has also re
sulted in a physical confronta
tion.
The students injuries consisted 
of a bloody nose and swollen right 
eye. He refused medical trans
portation but insisted that a for
mal complaint be filed against 
the student.
10/17INDECENT ASSAULT,
6:47 am. Astudent said that while 
walking to campus on South 
Negley Avenue, she was as
saulted by somebody sitting at a 
bus stop. The student said she 
walked past the person and con
tinued walking toward Ellsworth 
when he grabbed her right but
tocks. She turned to the person 
and asked him for his name, tell
ing him she would remember his 
face. She ran across the street, 
and he proceeded towards her. 
She ran two blocks and saw the 
person walk back toward Centre 
Avenue. She then walked to Frew 
Street and phoned Campus Po
lice.
Though the student was 
grabbed from behind, she was 
not harmed. The student refused 
to go to a hospital or talk with a 
counselor. Student Affairs was 
notified, and the student was es
corted to her residence.
10/19 SCAM, 2:19 am. A stu
dent said that while she and two 
other people were sitting on the 
front steps of Shirley Apartments, 
they were approached by some
body who had been walking north
bound on Dithridge Street. He 
stopped and began to tell them 
that he was from the Urban 
League and that he was a good 
Christian. He asked if they had
a gas can and then explained that 
he was out of gas at the BP Sta
tion at Murray and Forward Av
enues. The man said he worked 
at the University of Pittsburgh 
and that he had an office at the 
Cathedral of Learning. He quickly 
showed them an ID card. The 
student said that the card looked 
fake but could not tell if it was 
really a Pitt ID. The person asked 
for $5, but he was given only 
$1.50. The student and a witness 
recognized the person, as he had 
attempted a similar scam on them 
at Ritters Diner several months 
ago.
While a CMU officer was obtaininginformation from the stu
dents, another officer was check
ing the area. He spotted some
body fitting the students descrip
tion of him walking on OHara 
Street near WPIC. The officer 
went up the street and turned 
around, but the person was gone. 
Pitt Police were notified and re
sponded to the area because it 
was thought that the person en
tered one of the parking garages. 
Pitt later received a call about 
the same person trying to obtain 
money from a Pitt student in front 
of Benedum Hall, which was di
rectly across the street.
A Pitt officer said that the per
son was arrested four days ear
lier on theft by deception charges. 
As officers returned to campus, 
Pitt Police stopped the person in 
Benedum Hall for trespassing.
10/19 UNAUTHORIZED SO
LICITORS, 7:03 pm. Over the 
course of the 3-11 pm shift, Cam
pus Police received several calls 
from RAs and residents in Morewood Gardens, Doherty Apart
ments, and Hamerschlag House 
that there were door-to-door 
salesmen asking for donations 
and offering laser-etched art
works 5" x 8" in return. The solici
tors worked for the Collegiate 
Association for the Research of 
the Principal. The Principal is an 
idea that one person can make a 
difference. One solicitor was 
stopped on the first floor B-tower 
of Hamerschlag House as he was 
making his pitch. He was in
formed of CMUs solicitation 
policy and warned that if he con
tinued his activity on campus, he 
would be arrested for trespass
ing. Another sohcitor was stopped 
and told the same thing.
10/19 MARCH/RALLY, 9:51 
pm. At 8:30 pm, approximately k 
300 students from CMU, the 
University of Pittsburgh, and 
Chatham College, assembled at 
the tent on the Cut to protest
sexual violence. The rally was 
orderly and the media was repre
sented by news crews from chan
nels 2,4, and 11. The rally ended 
without incident at 9:51 pm, when 
the group left campus and 
marched to the University of 
Pittsburgh. Vice President Don 
Hale was advised.
10/20 THEFT, 2:03 pm. On 
October 19, a temporary employee 
was sent to work at the High
lander Cafeteria. While the indi
vidual was working for Dining 
Services, she removed $19 in cur
rency from the cash register.
There was also a discrepancy of 
$36 in sales being added to the 
totals, but at the time of the re
port, more information was not 
available.
The individual asked her su
pervisor to be excused to go to the 
store to get some personal items. 
At that time, she left and never 
returned to work.
10/20 RECKLESS DRIVING,
8 pm. A Campus Police officer 
radioed that a red Acura had just
driven on the GSIA sidewalk by 
the Posner Hall entrance. The 
vehicle turned around at the load
ing dock and was heading down 
Tech Street, making a right on 
Margaret Morrison Avenue. The 
responding officer observed the 
vehicle go up the hill dorm drive
way.
The vehicle was stopped and 
driver was IDed as a CMU stu
dent. The student admitted it was 
a stupid mistake. The student 
said that he found the closest 
place to unload into the studio 
theater, and after unloading, he 
drove up the sidewalk and onto 
Tech Street.
A check of the area showed a 10 
foot section of the GSIA grass 
area that had been driven on. No 
permanent damage appeared to 
have been done to the area. The 
student was issued a CMU cita
tion for reckless driving.
No pedestrians were on the 
sidewalk at the time of the inci
dent.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  25 October 19937
Senate says GSO will get additional funding
GSO, from page 1
said Wolfson. Groups that were funded 
by GSO were automatically given zero 
percent, as well as some organizations 
that Wolfson said were policy reasons.
For example, Sweepstakes and Spring 
Carnival were indicated as having zero 
percent graduate participation. Gradu
ates dont participate in Spring Carni
val, said Wolfson. GSO can do some
thing during Carnival for graduate stu
dents.
Student Government President Dave 
Wolpert was one of the undergraduate 
students who helped draft the proposal. 
He said that the relationship between 
Student Senate and GSO needed to be 
changed. There are clearly problems 
with the structure of Student Govern
ment, said Wolpert, and were looking 
farther into the problem.
Wolpert said Student Government 
wanted to make more funding available 
to GSO.
Graduate students cant participate 
fully in the activities that they spend 
[the Graduate Activities Fee on], said 
Wolfson. Senates graduate represen
tation is very spotty. There is no indica
tion that Student Senate will change its 
ways.
This year, Student Senate received 
$138,600 from the total Graduate Ac
tivities Fees. Next year, assuming the 
graduate population is relatively the 
same, Senate will receive $113,300, a 
reduction of $25,300. At the start of the 
1995-96 academic year, Senate will lose 
another $25,300 reduction in funds. Ac
cording to Student Government Trea
surer Dave Martin, who also was a mem
ber of the group, the money lost will be
made up by either cutting from organi- capital for the Tilted Square, sponsoring 
zations budgets or raising the Under- more Lecture in Seminar graduate lecgraduate Activities Fee. ture series, and holding a fall and spring

Use of the Graduate Activities Fee
according to Activities Fee Proposal, October 19,1993
Number of graduate students paying the Activities Fee 2,200
Total Graduate Activities Fee (GAF) $220,000
Total GAF received by Student Senate $138,600
Total GAF spent by Senate on graduate students $89,000

Martin. Student Senate is ineffective in 
the way that it distributes funds. Two or 
three years ago, GSO did nothing, but 
since then, it has become more visible 
than any other organization. They talked 
about reallocating the Graduate Activi
ties Fee last year, but nothing has come 
of it.
GSO received about $80,000 from the 
Graduate Activities Fee this semester, 
but nextyear, GSO will receive $106,700, 
an increase of $26,700.
According to Wolfson, some of the uses 
of the extra money include regaining
substantial part of its money to gradu
ate departments. Well sit down and 
decide where this money is going, said 
Wolfson.
Moneet Singh, Student Senates Hu
man Resources chair, voted against the 
resolution, but proposed an amendment 
to the proposal that would give GSO 100 
percent of the Graduate Activities Fee. 
The amendment failed 6-16-1.
Senate has had trouble filling gradu
ate seats for a long time because gradu
ate students dont perceive Senate as 
being representative oftheir needs, said
Singh. It makes sense to split the gradu-. 
ate seats away from Senate and form a 
graduate branch of Student Govern
ment.
Singh said that GSO did not want the 
responsibility of managing all of the 
Graduate Activities Fees. Im not sure 
GSO should control any money until 
they become an organization that is will
ing to take the responsibility for gradu
ate needs, Singh said.
Greek Council President Demian 
Johnston, who has an ex-officio post on 
Student Senate, said that if groups that 
only represent a fraction of the campus, 
such as GSO, receive money straight 
from the Activities Fee, then any stu
dent should be able to choose their pri
mary membership in one organization 
and contribute 60 percent of his/her Ac
tivities Fee straight to that organiza
tion, then the leftover $40 would go to 
Student Senate.
Erik Altmann, a graduate computer 
science student, is opposed to the resolu
tion also. He said, Graduate students 
tend to be a ghettoized lot who dont do 
much for the community, and who take 
even less responsibility for how their tax 
dollars are spent than Student Senate 
does.
Wolpert said that this resolution was 
the first step toward restructuring Stu
dent Government. The group is con
tinuing to meet, he said.
Our next step is rewriting the fiscal 
policy, which is tricky, said Wolpert. 
The basic thrust of our meetings is to 
rewrite the Bylaws [of the Student 
Body]. Wolpert said that the current 
government setup restricts rather than 
regulates important changes.
Women protest 
sexual violence
MARCH, from page 1
women have the right to be respected,; 
and violence to women is not just a 
sexual problem, but a social problem as 
well.
Antionette Ford from Allegheny Com
munity College and Moira Meadows from 
the University of Pittsburgh read a poem 
about domestic violence. Another; 
speaker spoke about the occurrence of; 
acquaintance rape on college campuses.'
Following the speakers, there was an; 
open microphone for people to share; 
personal experiences related to sexual; 
violence. One of the speakers was Jody 
Lutz, Interfratemity Council president 
and member of Sigma Tau Gamma, who. 
represented the opinions of the Greek 
system on the CMU campus. He dis
cussed the stereotypes about fraterni
ties and how these stereotypes breed; 
ignorance. Lutz said that through edu
cation, understanding, and mutual re-, 
spect, the sexual violence on campuses 
may decrease.
Many other fraternity members' 
marched to show their support of the 
cause. Demian Johnston, Greek Council 
president and member of Delta Upsilon, 
said, When comments [about fraterni
ties] get aggressive, fraternities get de
fensive.
Weneedto open communication, said 
Johnston.
Brandyn Woodard, a senior Spanish i 
major and SafeWalk escort, attended 
the march. We still need more aware
ness [on campus], Woodard said. Ev
eryone may be desensitized [to sexual 
violence] but its something everyone 
needs to hear.

Foul stench in Skibo 
reeks of larger problem
For the past few years there 
has been a serious problem with 
the sewage pipes in Skibo.
Lately, that problem has been 
especially apparent to anyone 
who might happen to be walk
ing past Entropy. The smell of 
sewage has become pungent and 
rank  worse than ever before.
Physical Plant has attempted 
to alleviate the smell by treat
ing the leaking sewage with dis
infectant, but in order to fully 
repair the leak, tens of thou
sands of dollars will have to be 
spent.
With the destruction of Skibo 
looming on the horizon, it is 
doubtful that this money will 
ever be allotted.
The smell has been causing 
problems for those who work in 
Skibo, and even for those just 
dropping by Entropy. The stench 
has in fact already closed En
tropy twice, causing a manager 
to get physically ill.
This is unfortunate because 
not only does Entropy lose rev
enue when it is forced to close 
early, but its student employees 
who need the money are also 
affected.
The leak is also very close to 
Dining Services and Kiltie 
Court, which could lead to the 
possible contamination of food 
and water.
The sewage leak is really just 
one link in the chain of system
atic breakdowns occurring in 
Skibo.
Spraying disinfectant instead 
of tackling the problem with long 
term repairs represents the 
flawed logic which has been used 
in solving Skibos inefficiencies.
Until the university learns to 
solve problems when they arise 
instead of postponing and cov
ering them up, the quality and 
quantity of new campus projects 
and the University in general 
 will Suffer.
University should not 
combine major events
Student Affairs and Student 
Activities are contemplating the 
idea of combining Parents 
Weekend, Homecoming Week
end, and the International Fes
tival into one huge, festive event.
This past weekend, Parents 
Weekend and the International 
Festival concentrating on Af
rica were combined for the first 
time, and plans for the future 
could include adding Homecom
ing events for alumni to the 
schedule of events.
Student Affairs has, fortu
nately, contacted various stu
dent organizations for input on 
this idea.
It is essential that the input of 
the student body is considered 
for major decisions such as this.
In the past, Student Affairs 
welcomed student input con
cerning Freshmen Orientation 
and the International Festival.
Were glad that the trend is 
continuing, and hope it will con
tinue for future events.
However, we feel that combin
ing all three events into one 
Weekend would be extremely 
chaotic, not only for the partici
pants but for the organizers as 
well. This combination would 
put a huge time constraint on 
all schedule events.
For example, events for the 
International Festival could not 
be scheduled during the Home
coming football game.
Also, such a combination, 
would bring too many people to 
campus.

Cooperation needed to 
combat sexual assault
Editor:
Tuesday night, 
while attending the 
Take Back the 
Night rally as a visi
tor to Carnegie
Alumni, parents, students, 
and'faculty all have different 
interests.
Student Affairs would have to 
work triply hard to make sure 
not only that the interests of 
each group are met, but that 
one subset of this gigantic event 
would not suffer cuts to make 
room for another.
Student Affairs strives to 
make Homecoming, Parents 
Weekend, and the International 
Festival better for everyone each 
year, but combining these events 
into one weekend could detract 
from them rather than allowing 
them to enhance campus life.
If Student Affairs wishes to 
combine events, the best combi
nation would be Parents Week
end and Homecoming Weekend. 
In this case, parents would be 
able to attend the Homecoming 
game and cheer for the Tartans 
with their sons and daughters 
as alumni and students come 
together to demonstrate school 
spirit.
If Student Affairs decides that 
Homecoming, Parents Week
end, and the International Fes
tival must be combined, they 
should look into an extended 
weekend similar to Spring 
Carnivals events.
An extra day could help allevi
ate scheduling complications 
and mayhem, even though 
achieving a concentration of in
terest on each of the weekends 
major topics would still be very 
difficult
Letter to 
the Editor
Mellon, I learned of the campus dia
logue regarding the issue of sexual vio
lence and your fraternity system. Rep
resentatives of both campus womens 
groups and the fraternities stated that 
the latter must take further action to 
combat sexual violence.
Campus womens organizations pos
sess unique insights into the realities of 
sexual violence at the university. Only 
the fraternities, however, are fully 
knowledgeable of the inner workings of 
the fraternity system. In order to craft 
an effective, proactive approach to combate sexual violence, these groups must 
work together to pool their knowledge 
and to draw up and implement a pro
gram. Members of the faculty or the 
administrators would surely be willing 
to facilitate these efforts, if desired.
If members of the university commu
nity instead squander their energies on 
placing blame or on being defensive, the 
focus of the dialogue will cease to be the 
victims of sexual violence. Now is the 
time for all concerned parties to build on 
the shared goals and sentiments ex
pressed at the rally.

Two-way radios are 
needed in escort vans
services by not replacing the radios.
Two-way CB radios should always be 
in each Escort van, in the dispatch of
fice, and in the CMU Police office. The 
radios are used to coordinate pickups; 
this means that riders must wait longer 
before being picked up. Without radios, 
the dispatcher has no idea when the van 
will return.
If the police have plans to fix or re
place the radios, they have kept their 
plans too quiet. Riders see no progress 
being made. At the moment, it appears 
that we will have to see two rapes in a 
month before any action is taken to 
correct a long-standing problem.
The lack of response from Escort and 
Shuttle riders and drivers is especially 
sickening. Rather than complain, they 
go along with a dangerous system. Com
plaints about the service should be sent 
to the Campus Police at 268-2323.
Escort works really hard to take people 
home, and the new vehicles are appreci
ated. Hopefully this letter will provoke 
a long-awaited response from the Cam
pus Police explaining their plans for 
repairing or replacing the broken twoway radios in the Escort vans so that we 
can once again feel safe as we ride home.

I find it the ulti
mate in ironies that 
I, as a socialist, 
should agree with a 
capitalist billionaire 
about an issue relating to the welfare of 
workers. However, Ross Perot is cor
rect in his opposition to NAFTA.
There is a saying that those, who do 
not learn from history are doomed to 
repeat it. There is, in history, another 
free trade agreement  the Open Door 
Policy in China. The British East India 
Company imported opium into China, 
converting many Chinese into opium 
addicts. The foreign capitalists who built 
factories there paid no attention to the 
environment or the health and safety of 
workers in those factories. Little chil
dren worked 16 hours a day in factories 
where they were often locked in at night. 
In match factories they got phosphorus 
bums all over their bodies, and when 
they died, were simply thrown on the 
trash heap for the dogs to eat. They 
were considered nothing more than an 
expendable input into a product.
Supporters of NAFTA say it couldnt 
occur today because child labor laws 
exist and environmental organizations 
have power. Well, judging from the 
maquiladora factories, I think they are 
being overly optimistic. Pollution near 
these factories is so bad that children 
are being bom without brains or with 
numerous other terrible birth defects.
NAFTA, in my opinion, is nothing but 
a smoke screen for exploitation. Ameri
can workers will lose because high-pay
ing manufacturing jobs will translocate 
to Mexico and be replaced by service 
sector jobs paying five or six dollars an 
hour. Mexican workers will lose because 
of pollution, low pay, bad working con
ditions, and no benefits. It is a lose-lose 
proposition for everyone except the 
American capitalists who take advan
tage of NAFTA to increase their profits.

Kevorkian grants dignified death
Matt Ball
Non-human animals have few advantages in our society. 
Using any excuse from taste to habit to sport, we enslave, 
castrate, experiment on, slay, and fillet any being weaker 
than us not protected by an enforced law.
Yet, when confronted with a non-human animal in great 
and chronic pain, most people would not be so cruel as to 
prolong the animals suffering. For the relative handful of 
animals whose interests we grant any respect, a death with 
dignity is granted when a being no longer positively values its 
agonizing existence.
But when it comes to a human in the same condition of 
unending suffering, the individual is the last one considered. 
Doctors blindly pursue the extension of physical life by any 
technological means.
Loved ones often concern themselves only with their own 
possible loss and the hope for a miracle cure. All the while, the
individual is allowed to suffer. This suffering also drains 
tremendous amounts of limited resources fromthe individuals 
family, the health care system, and government programs.
Into this fray walks Jack Kevorkian who is concerned only 
with the essence of the situation: the desire of the individual. 
Kevorkians actions are based on the principles we citizens of 
the United States hold as most sacred: the liberty of the 
individual and the right to self-determination.
Instead of seeing Kevorkian as the American hero who, 
defends the dignity of the individual, we are horrified by his 
actions. We try to hide him from view by enforcing laws that 
create unwanted and unnecessary suffering, because 
Kevorkian threatens our denial of our own death.
In our society, we take great pleasure from the products of 
the slaughter of a healthy non-human animal who has an 
innate and active desire to live, as long as killing is out of 
sight. In our society, a six-month fetus, developed and poten
tially viable outside the womb, can be dismembered legally, 
as long as the killing is out of sight. <
Yet if an adult human decides that his life is not worth 
living and wants to choose a safe and effective means ot 
ending his suffering, we are appalled and cannot pass legis
lation quickly enough to prohibit this.
Taking the life of an innocent is accepted as long as it

Navy overreacts to Tailhook
James 5. Brown
Two summers ago, the 
Tailhook Scandal rocked the 
nation. The Tailhook convention 
had been held every year. It gen
erally amountedto nothingmore 
than a huge, raucous party. The 
difference between the last one 
and most, however, is that some
body complained.
A woman, Navy Lt. Paula
Coughlin, reported sexual assault 
to a Navy Admiral, who stone
walled. When her story finally 
broke to the press, much of the 
public was outraged. Many were 
outraged that the Navy took such 
a light attitude towards sexual 
assault, and that they would 
stonewall rather than research 
Coughlins complaint. A slew of 
others at the convention came 
forward to report that they too 
had been assaulted. The Navy 
now had a major image problem 
on its hands.
I can see why some people are 
angry. The military is tradition

Justice wasnt served in Denny trial
Jason A. Specland
Today, in Los Angeles, everything is 
peaceful. Rioters arent roving the 
streets, and angry mobs arent looting 
and plundering innocent shops and 
homes. Unfortunately, justice may have 
been miscarried to prevent it.
Weve all seen the videotape of 
Reginald Denny being beaten sense
less by an angry mob, merely for being 
in the wrong place (and of the wrong 
color) at the wrong time. The jury saw 
the same videotape we did, oyer and 
over again.
This jury, however, was influenced 
by another set of video tapes entirely. 
They were influenced by the videotape 
of Los Angeles police officers beating
Rodney King. They were influenced by the 
videotapes of the city of Los Angeles in 
flames, rioters tearing the streets apart. 
They were influenced not by evidence and 
testimony but by fear.
Regardless of the sentencing of Henry 
Watson and Damian 
'Williams, this case 
should be considered 
forever to be a trav
esty of justice. When 
a black juror was dis

removal of a white _______________________
male juror. Apparently, the color of a
jurors skin is more important than his 
prudence. One by one the frightened ju
rors fell, some to illness, and others to 
personal problems. Those jurors remain
ing on the case were so frightened by
thoughts of riots and racism, that the 
concept of justice was tossed out the 
window. The lack of a definite verdict is 
a telling illustration of the jurors cow

a mistrial was declared on another count 
because of a deadlocked jury.
There are those who examine the case 
and joyfully proclaim that justice has
been served. I dont agree with them. 
There are others who angrily shout that 
Watson and Williams got off too easily. I 
dont necessarily agree with them, either. 
The actual verdict really isnt relevant. 
What bothers me is the jurors inability to 
stand up in the face of possible civil un
rest, and the eagerness of the attorneys 
and the media to aggravate a racial situ
ation as much as possible.
Just how long will it be before black 
jurors will refuse to convict a black man, 
for fear of racial retribution? How long 
will it be before the color of a persons skin, 
and not their objectivity determines jury 
selection? How long will it be before our 
courts are once again segregated? And 
most importantly: What ever happened to 
blind justice?

10The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon * 25 October 1993Japans internal changes have global repercussions
Neighbors must remain aware of societies in continual flux
David Schwartz
There is a revolution going on in Ja
pan right now. It is not a violent revo
lution, nor is blood being shed in the 
process, but the impact of the revolu
tion is far-reaching, and its effects are 
being felt throughout society, reaching 
the very core of the Japanese social, 
economic, and political structure.
Observers and Japan watchers 
surely understand the magnitude of 
the changes occurring, but to the aver
age American, some of the trends may 
be imperceptible and could easily be 
looked over as inconsequential or tri
fling.
This may be due to the fact that 
changes in Japan occur, more or less, 
very slowly and with little fanfare. Re
gardless, current changes are altering 
and challenging some fundamental 
ideas and widely held beliefs held by 
Japanese.
These changes will have certainly 
have an effect on its domestic as well as 
foreign policy.
Japan has been a very status quo 
society with specific guidelines and rules 
governing and shaping its political, eco
nomic, and social structure.
Cynics would argue that the Japa
nese system is rigid and unrelenting, 
whereas those with a less cynical view 
would posit the notion that Japan may 
be seemingly unbending but is in fact
capable of change. I believe the cynics 
to be wrong and the non-skeptics to be 
quite understated in their assessment. 
The evidence speaks for itself, but al
low me to elaborate.
In 1955, a dynasty of Borts was bom. 
From that year on, and for the next 38 
years without interruption, Japan was 
governed by the Liberal Democratic 
Party (LDP).
Itwasaparty strongly supported by 
many facets of Japanese society be
cause of the tremendous success it 
had in bringing the nation out of the 
ruin of war and into the ranks of the 
great economic powers.
On the heels of the LDPs rise, and 
its long-lasting hold on power, grew a 
large government bureaucracy and a 
powerful industrial base.
This relationship came to be called 
the golden triangle because of the 
tremendous wealth that it generated 
for the nation, and because it was so 
strong and unalterable.
Not only did the interdependence of 
these three poles foster mutually sup
portive and strengthening bonds 
amongst them, but it provided security 
and prosperity for the Japanese people 
as well, although with great cost, to be 
sure; there is a popular saying, rich 
Japan, poor Japanese.
However, like so many other good 
things, this too had to come to an end, 
and I believe it came to an end when the 
(in)famous bubble economy burst in 
the late 1980s.
Its effects were not immediate, but 
they did usher in a torrent of internal 
problems.
In addition, external pressures by 
Japans major trading partners were 
becoming greater, and the global eco
nomic slowdown was also beginning to 
take its toll on this major export-ori
ented country.
In concert, internal and external 
sources of pressure were creating strong 
internal currents of bitterness, leading 
to the disruption of long-held popular 
beliefs and, more bluntly, to the rejec
tion of the LDP.
This pivotal moment is of great im
portance in that it marks a turning 
point in the business as usual atti
tude that was the norm for the longest 
time.
The LDP became the first target of 
the Japanese voters WTath and anger
 what was increasingly being per
ceived as a corrupt political party that 
controlled an undemocratic and unre
sponsive political structure  and as a 
result they were supplanted with a coa
lition government, led by Morihiro 
Hosokawa, promising change and re
form. The LDPs 38-year rein ended 
this summer.
Unfortunately, I feel that this coali
tion is far too fractious to be able to 
present well-thought out expeditiously 
implemented policies. How can it?
The coalition must compromise with 
members whose views vary widely and 
represent groups of LDP-defectors, So
cialists, New Party members, and oth
ers.
With all this internal change occur
ring, the global economy was (and is) 
providing its fair share of pressure as 
well and is winding up to deal a power
ful blow to Japanese industry.
Not being able to weather the slow
down in the global economy, while also 
being blasted by the currency markets
(the Yen appreciated over 20 percent in 
value during the first six months of the 
year), Japanese industry was being 
shaken to its very core and, with it, 
Japanese society.
It used to be the case that Japanese 
companies would provide its workers 
with security guarantees such as life
time employment, but with the Japa
nese economy reeling in recession those 
beliefs have been shattered.
For the first time companies like 
Nissan, Toshiba, Matsushita, and oth
ers are letting go of part of their work 
force  unemployment is now becom
ing a major concern!
For Americans, accustomed to a more 
flexible labor market, such changes are 
taken with less emotion (this is not to 
obviate the pain of losing a job, though) 
than is the case in Japan.
Japanese now see the rugbeingpulled 
from under them by the very companies 
that they have been so loyal to. Domes
tic concerns are not the only problem 
facing the Japanese, however.
If this werent enough, Japan is also 
in the midst of an identity crisis via-a. 
vis its role in Asia and in the global 
political system, a very delicate and 
emotional subject for Japanese espe. 
cially because of its history in Asia.
Creating even more consternation, 
with the U.S. apparently pulling itself 
inward, and with it the security uni. 
brella that has sheltered Japan since 
the end of World War II, Japan is faced 
with the prospect of being relatively 
naked in a rather hostile region where 
nations such as North Korea, China, 
and Russia can run amok.
I feel that given such prospects it is 
important for Japan to develop its mili. 
tary capabilities beyond its current 
limits and strive to project its influence 
in conjunction with the other nations 
in the region.
It is then by choice and conscious 
action, complicated by an ever chang. 
ing and volatile world, that Japan is 
going through a revolution of thoughts 
and ideas.
One certainty is that the pace of 
change in Japan is being greatly influ
enced by external changes and pres
sures and, as a result, will force Japan 
to shift from passivity to heightened 
activity.
Furthermore, how Japan changesinternally while adapting to its external 
environment will be of great impor
tance not only for itself but for its 
neighbors as well.
David Schwartz is a fifth year senior 
double majoring in economics and po
litical science.
It is then by choice and conscious action,

Tailhook aftermath unfair
TAILHOOK, from page 9
complaining are the same 
people who are against the 
militarys meddling into its 
personnels off-duty sexual ac
tivities.
Recently, the Navy had to 
drop the charges against 
Coughlins alleged harasser. 
She had positively identified 
him, but a crowd of people 
identified him as being with 
them during the time of her 
assault. The Navy had pressed 
charges against one man, hav
ing seen a picture of him and 
a topless woman together. 
They had pressed charges 
against another man who was 
consentually shaving a 
womans pubic hair.
One can now see that the truth 
gave way to political correctness 
in the Tailhook incident. The 
Navy was under pressure to nail 
every man who was at Tailhook, 
common sense and truth be 
damned. The truth about 
Tailhook is that a bunch of people 
got together and had a big party. 
As with most big parties there 
was lots of drinking, and there 
was lots of sex.
Sometimes lots of drinking 
and lots of sex mean that some 
people are going to consent to 
things they would not otherwise 
consent to. I suspect that many 
of the allegations stem from the 
new-wave feminist idea that 
women should be able to change 
the rules even after the game is
over.
If a sexual assault can be 
proven in a court of law, the 
assailant should be pros
ecuted. But rules that require 
a man to have sixth-sense to 
figure out if what he is going to 
do is sexual harassment are 
ridiculous.
The real message from 
Tailhook should not be one 
that men are evil. It should be 
one of prudence. If you dont 
want to deal with raucous, 
sexually explicit speech or be
havior, dont go to raucous, 
sexually explicit parties.

Tartan runner wins UAA crown
Langer leads men to fourth place; women finish fifth
courtesy of CMU Athletic Department 
Senior Jim Langer placed first in the UAA 
championship this past weekend at Emory University.
By LUBOMIR W. KOCHANSKYJ
Tartan Sports Editor 
& ERIC STRAUSS
Tartan Assistant Sports Editor
Senior Tartan runner Jim Langer won the UAA 
cross-country individual title and earned his third 
first-team All-UAA selection at the UAA champi
onships Saturday at Emory University in Atlanta, 
leading the Tartans to a fourth-place finish at the 
league meet.
He ran the best race of his career, mens cross
country coach Gary Meckley said after the meet. 
Ive never seen him running better. He ran a 
smart race, and didnt run with the leaders early 
they tend to flare outandhis experience showed. 
He made the moves he had to make at precisely the 
right time. It was a very strategic, intelligent race. 
Langer, who ran the race in 25:56, won with a 
two-second margin over two runners from Case 
Western Reserve University.
I came through the first two miles in 10:09. You 
had to get out fast so I stayed with the top six 
runners from the first mile, said Langer. He de
cided to make his move on the downhill stretch to 
the finish line: After the 21/2 mile marker I stayed 
in third place until the last 200 meters. I was 
comfortable in the last 200 meters, and outkicked 
the two Case Western Reserve runners to the 
finish. That was the only time I was in first, when 
I came across the finish line.
Langers performance wasnt the only highlight 
for the mens team. Freshman Josh Greynolds 
earned a second-team All-UAA award, finishing 
twelfth at the meet in 27:05.
Hes a very, very smart runner, Meckley said. 
Thats something you cant teach. When he got 
here, he was automatically a very intelligent run
ner. He ran within himself, and thats why he 
finished where he did.

Sophomore Matt Beam, normally the teams 
number two runner, finished twenty first in 27:33. 
He ran in spite of muscle spasms in both calves.
Im really proud he didnt drop out, Meckley 
said.
Another top Tartan runner, sophomore Scott 
Moore, ran although he had tendonitis, and didnt 
fare as well. Had they been healthy, Meckley 
said, we may have had a chance to get closer to 
Brandeis, or even beat them. Brandeis, which 
finished third, and Case Western Reserve and 
Rochester, who tied for first, were nationally ranked.
Mike Rea finished 22nd, five seconds behind 
Beam.
Thats definitely the best race hes had this 
year, Meckley said. He ran an excellent race.
The other top finishers for the Tartans were 
freshman Paul Hatala, who finished 32ndin 28:08, 
and freshman Greg Stultz, who finished 33rd, six 
seconds behind Hatala.
The next big test for the Tartans will be the 
NCAA Mideast Regional on November 13. Langer 
admits that the regionals are his main focus. This 
race is a stepping stone to the regionals. That is 
where my attention is aimed.
The team is ranked sixth in the region right now, 
and Meckley said if his team was healthy and ran 
well, could finish as high as fifth in the region.
The final standings for the men runners are: 
Case Western Reserve University and University 
of Rochester (tied for first with 43 points), Brandeis 
University (third, 67 points), Carnegie Mellon 
University (fourth, 88 points), New York Univer
sity (fifth, 123 points), Emory University (sixth, 
172 points), University of Chicago (seventh, 186 
points), Washington University (eighth, 214 points), 
and Johns Hopkins University (ninth, 276 points).
The womens team finished fifth for the second 
straight year. Two-time UAA Athlete of the Week 
Missy Baustert, finished in fourth place with a
time of 19:16 to earn first team all-UAA honors. 
Baustert, a sophomore, ranks in the top ten among 
women runners in the conference. She posted a 
season best 19:17 in the 5K event at the September 
25 Dickinson College Invitational, where she placed 
fourth overall.
Coach Dario Donatelli was satisfied with his 
teams performance. Everyone put out, helping us 
to finish better than I expected, said Donatelli. 
We missed finishing fourth by eleven points. Roch
ester ran better than usual to edge us out. The top 
three finishers were no surprise.
Other Tartan runners who participated in the 
championships were freshman Becky Buchheit 
who finished 24th, co-captain senior Cindy 
Kolanowski finished 30th, freshman Sharon Lay 
finished 34th, and sophomore Sangita Jinwala 
took 37th.
The number two through five runners all ran 
better than I expected, said Donatelli.
Co-captain senior Jodi Piccolo was forced to drop 
out of the race with a twisted ankle, and was 
unable to finish.
The final standings were the University of Chi
cago finishing first with 50 points and host Emory 
University a close second with 54 points.
Rounding out the scoring were Brandeis Uni
versity (third, 84 points), University of Rochester 
(fourth, 118 points), Carnegie Mellon University 
(fifth, 129 points), Washington University (sixth, 
170 points), Case Western Reserve University (sev
enth, 171 points), Johns Hopkins University 
(eighth, 190 points), and New York University 
(ninth, 199 points).
The womens team has a home meet next Satur-: 
day when they go against Duquesne Universitys B 
team.
The meet will serve as a tune up for the Mideast 
Regional Finals which will be held at Allentown 
College on November 13.
Challenged took their first Mi
nors title.
We did not have much prac
tice, but the team is mainly the 
same guys from last year and we 
were more organized, said gradu
ate student Rob Torres, captain 
of Motivationally Challenged.
The final game of the evening 
was the Majors contest which saw 
Beta Theta Pi take on Pi Kappa 
Alpha. These two teams met twice 
before in the regular 
IM season. Beta and 
Pika tied in the first 
meeting and Beta took 
the second game.
We practiced alot 
before the season, and 
before this game to 
add some new plays. 
We had to come up 
with some new plays 
because we have 
 played Pika twice, 
said Beta Captain Ron Zmich, a 
senior chemical engineering ma
jor.
We practiced more than usual 
and tried to practice before every 
game. Our first game was a tie 
against Beta and that got us off to 
a good start. This game will be 
about defense, said Pika Cap
tain Ben Bell, a fifth-year archi
tecture student.
The game was definitely a de
fensive struggle. The final score 
was 76 in favor of Beta. Both 
teams drove the ball well and 
threatened for scores many times,
It was a new defense we 
worked on, one they had not seen 
before. The defense took all of 
their underneath passes away, 
said Zmich.
There were approximately 60 
IM football teams competing this 
year.
Mens soccer mounts comeback
Tartans brawl after OT win over Brandeis

Senior forward Alex Amezqulta couldnt fend off Rochester, but led CMU to a win over Brandeis.

Tartan Asst. Sports Editor 
& L. W. KOCHANSKYJ
Tartan Sports Editor
The Carnegie Mellon mens 
soccer team suffered a tough 
double-overtime loss against 
the University of Rochester on 
Friday, then came back to post 
a double-overtime win over 
Brandeis University in a game 
marred by a post-game brawl 
involving players, coaches and 
spectators.
After picking up a 5-0 win 
over Grove City College on 
Tuesday, the Tartans fell in a 
UAA contest, dropping the 
game against the Rochester 
Yellowjaekets on Friday night,
1-0 in double-overtime before 
posting a 3-2 comeback win 
over the Brandeis Judges.
After the Tartans jumped out 
to a 1-0 lead in the seventh 
minute on senior midfielder 
Mike Brazinskis goal, the 
Judges senior forward Vandy 
French tied the game in the 
26th minute.
In the first overtime, 
Brandeis struck after a 
scramble in front of the net in 
the 104th minute. Tartan se
nior goalkeeper David Shapiro 
dove for the ball, but was just a 
little late. Freshman forward 
Michael Christy beat him to
put the Judges in front, 2-1. 
Shapiro did not give up another 
goal, however, makingfour saves.
Less than two minutes later, 
Brazinski kept the Tartans alive, 
posting the tying goal in the 106th 
minute. He rifled a shot from 30 
yards out, beating Brandeis jun
ior goalie Erik Eisenhut high to 
the right side.
Several minutes later, Tartan 
head coach Nick Gaudioso tried 
to substitute for senior forward 
Alex Amezquita. Amezquita 
stayed in the game, however, and 
with 5:23 left in the game, headed 
in graduate student defender 
John Stivorics free kick past 
Eisenhut for the game-winning 
goal.
All in all, it was a great come
back. It was a great game for us, 
senior midfielder Pat Lucignani 
said of the on-field action.
It was a pretty big game for 
us, saidStivoric, who said great 
efforts were made by Brazinski 
and Amezquita.
The win gives the Tartans a
12-2-1 record (4-2-0 in the 
UAA), tying the school record for 
wins set in 1985 and matched in 
1990 and 1992.
The post-game activity almost 
matched the game action, how
ever, as a fight broke out while 
the two teams engaged in the 
traditional post-game hand
shake. The Brandeis players, ob
viously upset over the loss, ap
parently began a fight that 
eventually included coaches 
and spectators, and required 
the police to finish.
Things got a little out of 
hand after the game was over, 
Lucignani said. We came out 
to shake hands, and say good 
game and all, and a couple of 
their guys were upset they lost
 it was a great comeback, 
after all  they had chips on 
their shoulder. I dont know 
how things started, but they 
physically started to fight. We 
were all acting in self defense. 
We were trying to separate 
people, and all these littlefights 
broke out. It was a series of 
little fights, but it must have 
looked like a big metee.
The whole game was physi
cal from the get-go, Lucignani 
said. It was really unfortu
nate, but we acted inself-de
fense. They were upset they 
squandered a lead in overtime, 
and I cant blame them for 
that.
Lucignani was very critical 
ofBrandeis coach, Mike Coven.
Their coach, to tell you the 
truth, had no class, he said. 
He started a fight with one of 
our players, and one of our 
parents. Hes a little feisty guy 
we knew that from two years

Volleyball team anticipates UAA championship
By RAMSEY HONG
Tartan Art Editor
The Tartans volleyball game against Washing
ton and Jefferson College this past Thursday re
sulted in another unfortunate loss. CMU lost three 
games out of five, but on the whole the Tartans 
played better then they did at the tournament the 
weekend before.
Over the weekend, they played at Carlow Col
lege, taking on both Carlow and as Bethany 
College. Unfortunately, they lost both games there 
as well.
Coach Heather Hollands said, We lost both 
games, but we played very well. Thats something 
weve been working towards all year. In reference 
to the teams ability to communicate with each 
other on the court she said, were talking very 
well.
Since the UAA Championships at the University 
of Rochester are coming up very soon she was very 
optomistic. Were feeling positive about the tour
nament. The team is looking forward to the cham
pionships. I think were going to upset a few teams.

two main setters, was unable to play Saturday, g0 
freshman Lori Gregor came in as her substitute. 
It was a little uncomfortable at first but everyone 
was really helpful. said Gregor.
In last weeks matches, Hollands was happy with 
one situation . We had a lot more players coming 
off the bench.
Junior Carolyn Skarada said, I definitely think 
weve come a long way, but weve got to figure out 
what makes us click.
Everything comes down to the UAA Champion
ships at the University of Rochester. It seems to be 
the culminative goal that they have been working 
for. The team has one more game before the chainpionships at Bethany College, but that game (the 
third one against Bethany) seems to pale in com
parison to the championships. Surely the Bethany 
game is important. The results of the UAA Cham
pionships will mean a lot more to the Tartans. 
These games are the last ones of the year and the 
team would like to go out on a positive note.
The next game is at Bethany College on October 
26 at 7pm. The team then travels to upstate New 
York for the UAA Championships at the Univer
sity of Rochester on October 29-31.
Womens soccer team drops two over weekend
By LUBOMIR W. KOCHANSKYJ
Tartan Sports Editor
Coming into action this past weekend, 
the Carnegie Mellon womens soccer 
team was riding high on a six game 
winning streak. The team has already 
set a school record, posting their elev
enth win, a 6-0 decision over Bethany 
College last Wednesday.
Freshman forward Courtney Spence 
scored two goals, and senior Rachel 
Bourn, sophomores Bridget Caster and 
Nicole Poisson, and freshman Alyssa 
Newman each added one goal. Fresh
man goalkeepers Jill Weber and 
Katherine Morrison combined for the 
Tartans ninth shutout of the year.
Caster was named the UAA player of 
the week for defenders.
Head coach Julie Shackford applauds 
her teams record setting performance 
this season. When asked what enabled 
this team to be so successful, Shackford 
pointed out a number of factors.
Well, I think theres a lot of things 
involved. We brought in a very strong 
freshman class. Everything sort of 
clicked this year. Theres good team 
comrarderie. The chemistry has been 
good. The coaching staff is tremendous. 
I didnt expect this (success). I thought 
wed be lucky to have a .500 year.
Most of the Tartans success has come 
against local non-conference opponents, 
but that wasnt the only source for vic
tory.
We won games we werent supposed 
to. I think the sign of a good team is 
beating teams you werent supposed to
beat. We did it this year with Allegheny teams performance. I honestly dont

team.
I think we can win one more UAA 
game. I dont know if it will be Brandeis. 
We have to beat Grove City, or it will be 
a step backwards. As for the UAA, we 
won one game, which is one more than 
we did last year. Wanting to win one 
more game isnt being overly ambitious, 
she said.
It definitely isnt ambitious, but un
fortunately the team met with defeat 
twice over the weekend to the Univer
sity of Rochester and Brandeis Univer
sity.
Rochester scored a 3-0 win Friday 
evening thanks to the scoring of seniors 
Andrea Haveman and Libbie Tobin, and 
junior Christy Prame.
Shackford was still happy with the
let down. Another team could have, and 
lose 6-0.
One distinct advantage the 
Yellowjackets had was experience.
Rochester have seven or so seniors. 
Theyve been working together for a long 
time. They are the type of team that if 
you have any type of letdown, they will 
take advantage of it, said Shackford.
The Tartans did suffer a let down 
early in the game.
Ten minutes into the first half we 
kind of broke down a little bit, and of 
course they took advantage of it. They 
have some fantastic players.
On Sunday afternoon, the Tartans 
were again denied victory. This time the 
Judges of Brandeis University scored a
20 victory.
Late in the first half, CMU was denied

Shackford. It was a respectable game, 
and the second half was strong. We didnt
a goal scored by junior forward Chris
tina Isaly, who was called offside on the 
play.
I think we had a good first half. Both 
teams had chances. I couldnt tell 
whether Christina was offside, said 
Shackford.  Brandeis scoring so quickly 
after our goal was disallowed really burst 
our bubbles. Had Isalys goal counted, it 
could have been a very different game. 
Freshman midfielder Kristen Wood
cock scored 30 seconds after the disal
lowed goal, when she drove right through 
the middle of the Tartans defense.
In the second half, we had 10-15 
minutes of play mainly in the offensive 
end. They were keeping us in our defen
sive half of the field, said Shackford. 
They had a couple of girls up front that 
were very strong. We did a good job of 
containing them.
Woodcock scored her second goal with 
fifteen minutes left in the game. Both 
goals were assisted by freshman for
ward Andrea Illes.
Shackford praised her goalkeeper, Jill 
Weber who kept the game close. Our 
goalkeeper did a great job, especially on 
a couple of one on one opportunities 
where she came out and challenged, 
said Shackford. Last year Brandeis beat 
us 4-0, so I consider this a great im
provement.
The Tartans record now stands at 11- 
4-1 and 1-4 in the UAA. The team has 
two games remaining.
On Wednesday, the team travels to 
Grove City College.
They return to Gesling Stadium Sat
urday to battle the Maroons of the Uni
versity of Chicago in the concluding game 
of the season. Kickoff is scheduled for 1 
pm.

Who should grab big awards?
The Suicide Squeeze
by Anuj Gupta
Well baseball fans, now that 
we have reached the end of the 
993 season, its time for the long 
waited (drum roll, please) post 
;eason awards. So without fur
ther ado, lets get right to my 
elections.
National League MVP
Barry Bonds, San Francisco 
Giants. Sorry Pittsburghfans, but 
46 home runs, 123 RBIs, 29 sto
len bases, a .336 batting average 
and 129 runs scored, speak for 
hemselves. One cannot forget 
,hat he also single-handedly 
;ransformed an also-ran team 
from the year before, into a win
ner of 104 games and a contender 
until the final day of the season.
National League Cy Young 
Greg Maddux, Atlanta Braves, 
and Bill Swift, San Francisco 
Giants. Thats right, a co-Cy 
Young award, and the first time 
that has happened since Keith 
[emandez and Willie Stargell 
hared MVP honors in 1979. 
Maddux led the National League 
in ERA with a mark of 2.36, won
20 games, had 197 strikeouts, 
and had an opponents batting 
average of .232. Meanwhile Swift,
i (despite his August slump, won
21 games, had a very respectable 
ERA of 2.82, allowed only 55 
walks in 232 innings, and had an 
opponents batting average of .226. 
Of course one cannot neglect the 
impressive performances by Tom 
Glavine, and John Burkett.
National League Rookie of 
the Year
Mike Piazza, Los Angeles 
Dodgers. This award is not even 
a contest. He set a franchise 
record with 35 home runs, and 
112RBI, while hitting.318. If the 
Dodgers were in contention this 
year he would have had MVP 
consideration. Beware of him in 
the coming years as the Dodgers 
move into a division which should 
allow Piazza and fellow Dodgers 
to contend.
National League Comeback 
Player of the Year
Andres Galarraga, Colorado 
Rockies. In a year when come
backs were a common sight 
around the league, Galarragas 
comeback stood above the rest. A 
year ago he was on the verge of 
ending his career when he was 
released by the St. Louis Cardi
nals, but he returned and won 
theNL batting title. He also man
ages to become the most popular 
player in the Rockies brief his
tory, and should remain a stal
wart at first base for the Rockies 
for the next several years.
National League Manager 
of the Year
Dusty Baker, San Francisco 
Giants. Although Philadelphias 
Jim Fregosi, Pittsburghs Jim 
Leyland, and Atlantas Bobby Cox 
all did excellent jobs, this award 
clearly goes to Baker. He trans
formed a pitching staff and team 
that was in shambles the year 
before into one of the best teams 
in baseball. Even when theBraves 
had overtaken the Giants in early 
September, and itlooked like all 
was lost for the Giants, he was 
able to reorganize the troops and 
have them fight it out for the 
division crown until the last day 
of the season.
National League Executive
of the Year
This award goes to Lee Thomas 
of the Philadelphia Phillies. Tho
mas had the guts to stay away 
from the big name, high priced 
free agents, and instead go after 
cheaper and more risky players, 
such as Pete Incaviglia, Milt Th
ompson, and Jim Eisenrich. So 
what happens as a result of stay
ing away from David Cone and 
Barry Bonds ? The Phils lead the 
NL in runs scored, have five start
ers with 10 wins or more, and win 
a pennant. Enough said.
American League MVP
Frank Thomas, Chicago White 
Sox. In a year when one man hits 
nearly .400, and another hits a 
home run in eight straight games, 
the MVP choice is not entirely 
easy. But one can make the best 
case for Frank Thomas, for not 
only did he hit 41 HR, 128 RBI 
and bat .317, but he also kept it 
up on a consistent basis all year, 
and really turned on the heat 
when the Texas Rangers were 
closing in on the Soxs precarious 
hold on first in the AL West.
American League Cy Young
Randy Johnson, Seattle Mari
ners. Last week I compared the 
numbers of the leading candi
date, Jack McDowell, with those 
of Johnson. Johnson clearly beat 
McDowell in statistical catego
ries, andalthoughMcDowellmay 
have mattered more to his team, 
this award is given to the best 
pitcher, not the most valuable 
one.
American League Rookie of 
the Year
Tim Salmon, California Angels. 
Salmon hit 31 HR, 95 RBI, and 
scored 93 runs. He also had 12 
assists in the outfield. No other 
rookie came close to these kinds 
of numbers. Salmon is the cen
terpiece of the Angels rebuilding

Bo Jackson, Chicago White Sox. 
In a year with the likes of Kirk

with a fake hip and hits 16 HR,

In a year when he loses the 1992 
batting champion, Edgar

and loses Chris Bosio twice to a 
broken collarbone, he still man
ages to lead the Mariners to their

team, provided that it stays 
healthy next year and acquires 
some bullpen help could very well 
be a powerhouse in the American 
League. And its about time!!
American League Executive 
of the Year
Pat Gillick, Toronto Blue Jays. 
They dont call him stand Pat

it takes to win and he did it again 
this year, by first signing gamers, 
Paul Molitor and Dave Stewart, 
and then trading for Rickey 
Henderson when the competition 
just wouldnt go away. But 
Gillicks true test will come in 
next few years, as the Blue Jays 
continue to age and the farm sys
tem continues to dry up. Will he 
still have the gall or even the 
money to make the big moves 
anymore? It might be time for 
Gillick to pay a little more atten

Lucignani said, although there were no major injuries in the fight, 
his coach, Nick Gaudioso, was obviously not pleased.
He was upset about the whole thing, Im sure. Thats not what you > 
want to happen. We won, and we just wanted to get out of there with

Gaudioso was not available for comment.

Friday night was a heartbreaker, said graduate student John , 
Stivoric, I thought we outplayed them.
I thought we had stronger opportunities, said Stivoric, the , 
teams sweeper. The first half was uneven, but we had the momen-' 
turn in the second half.
Stivoric says the effect of the loss in the first game was devastating. , 
When they scored in the second overtime... it took a lot out of us, , 
he said. We came into todays game emotionally flat.

In the Grove City game, Lucignani scored twice and Brazinskv.

team closes its season on Saturday against the University of Chicago 
in Gesling Stadium, starting at 3 pm.
The next few matches will be tough for the Tartans. We got a 
couple of red cards, said Stivoric, so a couple of our starters are out. 
The next few games will be a challenge.
Stivoric said that this years team is much improved, and the 
teams reputation is starting to precede it. People come in, and its . 
a big game for them to play us, he said. Getting used to thats kind 
of fun for us.
The Tartans were ranked 17th in the NCAA and third in the MidAtlantic region going into this weekends action, and junior defender 
Jeff McJunkin was named UAA defensive player of the week for the

State-Behrend College and their tie with Division I foe the Univer-',

scorer. Should the team finish in the top four in the Mid-Atlantic 
region, they will qualify for their first-ever NCAA playoff berth.

How about those Pittsburgh Steelers?
Quarterback Sneak
by John Weber
Suddenly only two questions seem to be on the 
minds of Steeler fans. Is this the Steel Curtain 
again? and When is the Super Bowl being played 
this year?" While these questions may still be 
difficult to answer, I can tell you the Steelers are 
the team of the week and they have won four 
games in a row.
The Steelers didnt wait long to reveal their game 
planagainst the NewOrlean Saints. Rod Woodsons 
63 yard interception return gave the Steelers a 7-
0 lead. After another Woodson interception, Barry 
Fostertookitin the end zone on a screen to give the 
Steelers a 14-0 lead. The Steelers defense owned 
the Saints all day. I think David Johnson was the 
only Steeler starting defender who didnt do some
thing worth noting. The Steeler offense then took 
over and soon the undefeated Saints found them
selves down 37-0. Quarterback Mike Buck came 
into the game in the fourth quarter and helped the 
Saints get on the board with two TD passes. Final 
score: 37-14. This was a huge win for the Steelers 
(as you might have guessed). The Steelers have 
finally beaten one of the elite teams in the NFL. 
But are the Steelers ready for this new challenge?
Before the season began, some sports media 
people kept dwelling on the first place schedule of 
the Steelers. Well, guess what? You dont go to the 
Super Bowl to find the Bengals your opponent. You 
have to beat the best in the NFL if you want to be 
the best. The Steelers are playing like one of the 
best.
The Steelers defense is obviously its strength. 
The team has only allowed 341 yards rushing all 
year against some of the better rushing teams in 
the NFL (namely the Saints and Chargers). Gain 
per rush against the Steelers is 2.47 yards. This 
hasnt been done by a Steelers defense since ... 
since ... that is right! The Steel Curtain of the 
1970s. Most of this success is due to Kevin Greene. 
He leads the team with four sacks, but he is also 
much stronger than the man he replaced: Jerrol 
Williams. On runs, he holds his side of the line 
until the Steelers secondary can come up and help 
stop the play. This success has an added bonus  
it causes teams to pass into Rods World. This is 
something the Steelers havent been able to do for 
Woodson much. Quarterbacks under extreme pres
sure are firing into the secondary with crossed 
fingers and plenty of hope. However, Woodson, 
Camell Lake, and Gerald Perry, who seem to be 
everywhere, are picking off everything thrown at 
them. The defense is playing smarter also. They 
try to knock the ball away from every runner and 
receiver they come in contact with. The defense is 
currently tied in the AFC with the Bills for the 
most takeaways with 20,14 of which were inter
ceptions.
The Steeler offense is holding its own this year. 
It has the same talent level as last year but a lot 
more experience. Neil ODonnell has become a 
calm, cool quarterback who can avoid the rush and 
who seldom throws interceptions. The Steelers 
have not come from behind this year, but the 
offense has the characteristics of comeback teams. 
They dont fall apart when they get behind or make 
a mistake. Also, Dwight Stone and Eric Green are 
pulling down some big receptions this year.
All in all, the Steelers are a potential Super Bowl 
team. They still have a number of obstacles. If the 
Steelers beat the Browns they will probably win 
the AFC Central without too much problem. How
ever, the Conference comes next. In a few weeks 
the Bills come to Pittsburgh for a Monday Night
Football matchup. This is the big game for the 
Steelers. If the Bills fall to the Steelers, the Steelers 
will have a chance to be the top AFC team.
Another 41 week elevates my season record to
22-13. The Chiefs, Cowboys, Giants, and Lions 
helped me out by winning their games. The Charg
ers cant seem to put it together at all this year. 
Theyre tough, but theyre not getting many victo
ries. Last week, Joe Montana of the Kansas City 
Chiefs hobbled down the field as the time ticked off 
in the fourth quarter. He eventually found the end 
zone and a win as the Chiefs beat the Chargers 17
14.
The Cowboys won their fourth in a row by 
beating the 49ers 26-17. Though the Cowboys look 
like theyre back in championship form again, the 
Giants are in first in the NFC East after beating 
the Eagles 21-10. Eagles quarterback Bubby 
Brister didnt last long and his replacement, Ken 
OBrien, didnt do much either. The Giants right 
now are the best team in the NFC and possibly the 
NFL. Great defense and a good running attack 
spells victories for the Giants.
Detroits Mel Gray returned a kickoff for a touch
down as the Lions beat the Seahawks 30-10. Se
attle is just happy to be 33, but the Lions have 
found a little defense to go with their run and shoot 
offense.
Welcome to the Battle of Ohio, Part H.
If you werent convinced the first time, they 
showed us again. Yes, the Browns can beat the 
Bengals. The Browns won 28-17, letting the 
Bengals have three more points than in week one 
when they beat the Bengals 2814. The Cardinals 
destroyed the Redskins 36-6. The Redskins, for 
their effort, win the Bosworth Award for week 
seven. This game told me one thing: The Redskins 
are in trouble. As for the Cardinals, they are still 
trying to make up for their loss to the Patriots.
The Falcons beat the Rams a long time about two 
weeks ago. They played a Thursday game because 
of the baseball playoffs. All I know is that the
Falcons won, Deion Sanders played, and the gamt 
was boring. \
The lucky Raiders beat the Broncos on a big field 
goal with little time left 23-20. All I can say is that 
that field goal was the worst looking field goal that 
I have ever seen. The Raiders better have plenty of 
those field goals left for the second half of the 
season.
Finally, the Oilers beat the Patriots 28-14. The 
Oilers lost Commander Cody Carlson in the first; 
half to a groin injury. Warren Moon came in and 
actually had a good game.
The Oilers are trying to make a comeback bj 
beating the teams that they would have destroyed 
a year ago, but I guess you have to start somewhere.
Top Five Picks for Week 9
1. N.Y. Jets at N.Y. Giants
The Battle of New York. For the first time in a 
longtime this matchup could actually mean some
thing. The Giants are too tough this year. Giants
27-21.
2. Kansas City at Miami
I dont have much faith in Miami without Marino. 
Its a shame, this could have been the Dolphins 
year. Chiefs 2414.
3. Seattle at Denver
Seattle has played well and their defense is 
tough, but I cant go against the Brpncos in Mile 
High. Broncos 30-21.
4. Dallas at Philadelphia
Dallas takes the show on the road. For the 
Eagles, their storybook season has turned into a 
Freddy Kruger special. Dallas 31-3.
5. San Diego at L.A. Raiders
Trick or Treat. I think this game will be treat for 
the Chargers  a long awaited victory. Chargers 
17-14.

The Puck Stops Here
by Allan Bordius
The 1993-94 Calder Trophy, awarded 
to the NHL rookie-of-the-year will Hkely 
go to one of two young players from the 
Ottawa Senators. The first is Alexandre 
Daigle. Daigle was the number one over
all pick in this past summers entry 
draft. He is considered by many associ
ated with professional hockey to be the 
best prospect to come out of the Quebec 
Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) 
since Mario Lemieux was drafted first 
overall by Pittsburgh in 1984. Right off 
the bat, Daigle will be one of the fastest 
skaters in the NHL. His speed will prob
ably be his saving grace since he lacks 
size compared to many NHL defenders.
In addition to his brilliant playmaking, 
the young center also has a cannon-like 
shot. Last season at Victoriaville of the 
QMJHL, Daigle scored 45 goals and 137 
total points in just 53 games played. So 
far this season with the Senators, he has 
been scoring slightly above a point-agame pace.
The Senators other key rookie is Alexei 
Yashin. Yashin is also a center, but he 
will probably play one of Daigles wings 
because hes the only other player on the 
Ottawa team of the same caliber as the 
young French-Canadian. Yashins best 
strength is his shot.
He possesses the strength and agility 
to throw off quick and accurate wrist 
shots without any wind-up or hitch in 
his skating stride. Yashins biggest prob
lem will be adjusting to the NHL after 
playing in the larger rinks and lessphysical style of European hockey. 
Yashin will be no pushover physically 
(6'2", 198 lbs.) once he makes the transi
tion. He has the potential to become a 
true power forward.
So far, the best new goaltender in the 
league has been the New Jersey Devils
Martin Brodeur. Through Friday, 
Brodeur is 3-00 with a 2.33 goals 
against average, .904 save percentage, 
and one shutout. Brodeur is a large 
goaltender (6T'); his size allows him to 
block a large portion of the net and 
effectively cut down shooters angles. He 
gives up very few rebounds as well. An
other top New Jersey goaltending pros
pect is University of Maine star Mike 
Dunham. Dunham is perhaps the best 
goalie prospect today. Look for his NHL 
debut after he finishes play with the 
U.S. Olympic Team next March.
The Pittsburgh Penguins Markus 
Naslund also has the potential for a fine 
rookie season. Right wing Naslund 
scored 22 goals and 39 points in 39 
games with MoDo of the Swedish Elite 
League last season. He will be an effec
tive weapon from the wing, but maybe 
more so on the power play than even 
strength.
Naslund has excellent puck handling 
skills and above average skating ability, 
but his comparative lack of bulk will 
make him more a play maker,rather 
than a power winger in the mold of
Pittsburghs Kevin Stevens or Rick 
Tocchet. Naslund also has a reputation 
for having a quick temper and taking 
many stupid penalties, particularly for 
stick infractions. Given how the NHL 
has cracked down on violence, especially 
stick-related incidents, Naslund could 
be spending more than his fair share of 
time in the penalty box.
Another player to watch for after the 
1994 Winter Olympics is Quebec 
Nordiques prospect Peter Forsberg. Like 
Naslund, Forsberg plays for MoDo of the 
Swedish Elite League.
He is considered to be the best player 
outside of the NHL today. Forsberg is a 
center with excellent puck handling, 
skating, passing, and shooting ability. 
In international play he has shown the 
tendency to play more of a NHL-style, 
physical game. His transition to North 
American hockey should be an easy one.
One non-rookie who will make a large 
impact this season is Pittsburghs Mar
tin Straka.
Straka, a second-year player from the 
Czech Republic, currently leads the Pen
guins in goals. He scored six early in the
season, but has since slowed down. 
Straka will make a positive impact on 
the Penguins, especially in Mario 
Lemieuxs absence. He will probably fin
ish the season with 30-35 goals and 
about 70 points.
Goodnews for Penguins fans. Lemieux 
will make his 199,3-94 season debut 
Thursday night at the Civic Arena ver
sus the Quebec Nordiques.
Lemieux. is in search of yet another 
scoring title as the Penguins hope to 
bring a third Stanley Cup to Pittsburgh 
in four years.
If Lemieux can remain healthy, look 
for all aspects of Pittsburghs game to 
improve almost immediately. The Pen
guins big problem so far this season has 
been clutch ability  they are having 
trouble winning the close games or break
ing ties.
This season looks to be an especially 
promising one, for the new rookies as 
well as their teammates.

T
o complement Parents Weekend, Carnegie Mellon celebrated its third annual International 
Festival with four days of festivities from October 20 to October 23. Traditionally, the events 
relate to a certain cultural theme. This years festival focused on Africa. In the past the Festival 
has explored such themes as Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean.
The International Festival is an annual event that strives to raise campus awareness of international 
issues, promote community involvment, and provides opportunities for experiencing cultural diversity. 
The programs offered this year complemented Parents Weekend and were designed to entice our 
imagination and increase our appreciation for the complexity and variety of the numerous cultures in 
Africa.
The festival was designed with many ideas in mind. One of the primary goals of this university is to 
educate the students to be effective and competitive members. In a global economy, interaction with 
people from different cultures is crucial for one to gain a better understanding of the world, says Aliya 
Khan, Festival coordinator and assistant to the dean of Student Affairs. Three years ago, to fulfill this 
mission, President Robert Mehrabian formed the International Awareness Committee to increase 
multicultural enrichment on campus. Our focus has been on expanding campus involvement in 
programs and activities of a global nature, says Peter Stearns, chairperson of. the International 
Awamess Committee and dean of H&SS.
Opening with Wefa music and ceremonies, this years festival offered many interactive programs 
to increase cultural awareness. Oopali Operajita, an internationally reowned classical Indian dancer, 
presented tradtional and experimental choreography. Operajita has performed in the Odissi dance style 
all over the world and has been called the best Odisssi interpreter today by Indias most discriminating 
dance critic, P.V. Subramanim. Indian classical dance is complex and incorporates and requires a 
special language of hand gestures, expressive emotion, intricate footwork, all of which were codified 
more than 2000 years ago. Currently, Operajita is a Research Fellow at the Studio for Creative Inquiry, 
where she has worked on experimental choreography using lasers and other modern technological 
devices.
Three keynote speakers, each distinguished in their individual fields, spoke on topics pertinent to 
present-day Africa. Dumisani Kumalo, a South African journalist, lectured about apartheid and the 
continuing struggle for freedom in his country. Considered one of the most conversant speakers in the 
field on aparteid, Kummalo worked closely with many in the fore of the fight, including Nelson Mandela 
and Desmond Tutu.
The second keynote speaker, Ali Mazuri, an eminent Kenyan historian, discussed Africa and the black 
world in the New World order. Mazuri served on various committees and boards for the U.N. and the 
Organization for African Unity.
Camelia Sadat, the third keynote speaker featured, spoke about the role of Arab women concerning 
progresss and disadvantage. Daughter of late Egyptian president Anwar El Sadat, Sadat has received

English teacher holds cure to writers block
Neurotic Living
By Andrew Sproule
Its all right, everybody, Im 
back. I know that there has been 
much wailing and gnashing of 
teeth in the past four weeks that 
my column failed to make an ap
pearance. I realize that you, my 
loyal fans, have missed me  
yes, both of you.
The problem was that I had a 
small case of writers block. Im 
not sure how it happened, but I 
am pretty sure that me having 
writers block is one of the seven 
signs of the apocalypse. If you 
want to look it up, its right there
among disease, pestilence, and 
the moon turning blood red.
Someone suggested to me that 
in order to breakmy writers block 
I should just start writing. So, I 
took this advice and for the read
ers enjoyment, I "will print an 
excerpt of this piece. Its sure to 
be a collectors item.
Here it is: Linky morge goffum 
joopiness two-pee, two-pee, noble 
gasses, into hither booty gardens.
Im not Bure what it means ei
ther, but it did help me come to 
the conclusion that the person 
who gave me that advice is full of 
Morge goffum joopiness, to 
quote a soon-to-be famous writer.
Let me try to explain to you 
what writers block is like. Imag
ine that you are afflicted with 
something called speakers block. 
While suffering from this, some
body asks you a simple question, 
such as, How much is that doggy 
in the window? To which, nor
mally, you would reply, That is
by far the stupidest thing any
body has ever said to me. But 
instead, now that you are afflicted 
with speakers block, you say,
that it was just humor splooge. 
With those kinds of unfounded, 
slanderous accusations, how am 
I supposed to write the quality
. See, it lacks that cer
tain je ne sais quois (for the un
educated out there, thats French 
for je ne sais quois).
It didnt help matters any when 
someone suggested to me that 
my column wasnt topical, and
Ramsey Hong/Tartan Art Staff
type journalism stuff that you 
have come to expect from me? I 
am sensitive and I cant lightly 
take that sort of malicious, nag
ging criticism. I know that you, 
my fans, know me better than 
that. You wouldnt continue to
read this column if I wasnt keep
ing you up to date on fast-break
ing news stories, and the hottest 
current trends.
I have many sources in key 
positions all over the world. And 
when I say many, I mean that I 
once talked to a lower level func
tionary assistant to the assistant 
of the assistant of the assistant of 
some guy in the White House. 
The way that I got the source was 
through hard journalistic inves
tigation; I called information in 
D.C. and they gave the phone 
number. Lets see my nefarious 
critic defend his accusations now 
that Ive presented him with such 
staunch credentials. And topical
ity is my middle name (I still 
havent forgiven my parents for 
naming me Andrew Topicality 
Sproule). However, I digress from 
explaining writers block.
If you are curious as to how I 
broke out of the writers block, I 
have to admit I am a little reti
cent to explain it to you. Whatfi 
like you to believe is that as 1 s  
walking down the street, the sy 
opened up and God (for you attj! 
ists out there, replace God ^j 
nothingness) reached down 
touched my brow, thus op 
my eyes and showing me

Horror Stories
By Tom Harper
It never fails. Whenever I have to use 
a cluster to get some work done, some 
sadistic person kindly informs me that 
he or she have that particular computer 
reserved.
What amazes me is how they can sys
tematically come up to me and show 
absolutely no emotion over the inter
rupted train of thought I was having at 
that particular moment in time. Not to 
mention the fact that there are, of course,
no other open computers in the whole 
cluster.
A while ago I emailed the powers that 
be of cluster management, askingthatthey indicate which com
puters are reserved for such-andsuch a time  say with a little 
signor maybe have them go to 
the individual and tell them that 
said computer is reserved for said 
time. But they said the CCons 
have enough to do, and giving 
them little signs would simply 
distract them from the many im
portant tasks theyre doing.
So, I must either reserve a com
puter'or grin and bear it. How
ever, I dont want to exert pres
sure on someone to finish what
ever theyre doing in 10 seconds 
just so I can play Tetris or check my 
mail. Most of my writing is done at the
last possible moment, of course. Whose 
isnt? Therefore, I must live in constant 
fear of those people who, like killer maand say: Excuse me, I have this re
served.
The death knell of many creative ef_____forts.
The fact is, there are 
no available comput
ers on this campus. In 
Hunt, the entire clus
ter has to be evacu
ated because there is a 
class scheduled in 
there for about six 
hours. And they give 
you a full two minutes 
to quit whateveryoure 
doing and get the hell 
out of there. Its simi
lar to a Chinese fire 
Ramsey Hong/Tartan Art Staff drill haveeverybody 
get out for a few hours
chines, march up to the computer Im only to stampede back into position and 
working on and smile a great big smile fight for a computer.
And if you dont know already,
140 is only for night owls or very ea 
risers. CSW is just too important, 
doesnt matter how many Macs or DECi 
are free  those students need uttei 
silence to learn Clarisworks, a prograa 
I wouldnt go near now that Mac CSW: 
over for me.
So, me being the social commentatoC 
and Weird A1 Yankovic fan that I am,i 
decided to set my woes to music.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  25 October 1993L3
Isabel Fabian, El Salvadoran 
arty candidate, gives speech
By ZHUOHAN CAI
fartan Staffwriter
Isabel Fabian is the 29-yearjd leader of the M61ida Anaya 
kontes Womens Movement 
IocGl and electoral candidate 
or the upcoming elections in El 
Salvador. In these elections, the 
rst since the peace accords were 
igned in 1992, the public will 
determine a new president, najonal assembly, and municipal
rovemment.
 on Tuesday, October 19, she 
ipoke at Porter Hall about her 
jartys struggle to build a de
mocracy for a new El Salvador, 
jhe is a member of the 
farabundo Marti National Lib
eration Front (FMLN), a leftist 
political party opposed to the 
Nationalist Republican Alliance 
[ARENA), the governing party 
of El Salvador.
At their recent party congress, 
the FMLN made a momentous 
Jecision to have a pro-choice plat
form and nominate women as 
half of their candidates. As a 
leader of MAM, the broadest 
womens movement in the his
tory of El Salvador, Fabian can 
be considered one of the countrys 
prime candidates.
Speaking through an inter
preter, Fabian raised the issue 
of womens rights in El Salva
dor. In a country where rapists 
arenotadequatelypunished, and 
sometimes arent even punished 
at all, El Salvadors legal system 
should exercise the firm hand of 
justice and victims should re
ceive the essential protection cur
rently denied them, according to 
Fabian.
Although womens movements 
around the globe have shared 
causes and ideals, each regional 
organization has its own means 
of achieving those goalsmeans 
which are shaped by cultural 
and social conditions in each par
ticular country. Uniquely El Sal
vadoran, MAM is no exception.
Fabian feels that education 
would strengthen the womens 
movement. Hence, much of Fagrassroots leaders. Training in
cludes the diffusion of gender 
theory and raising the aware
ness of pertinent issues such as 
domestic violence and sexual ha
rassment.
Fabian also spoke about the 
need to cease U.S. intervention 
in the internal affairs of El Sal
vador. The 1992 Chapultepec Ac
cords, which ended a decade of 
civil war, mandated the gradual 
demilitarization of the country 
so that the nations armed forces 
only be deployed to repel exter
nal attacks. However, some in 
the government have sought to 
expand the armys role by rede
fining its mission to include the 
war on drugs, crime-fighting, 
and other projects.
A pamphlet that was distrib
uted to the audience cited Op
eration Strong Roads as one 
such project that involved the 
U.S. From mid-August to De
cember 93, American troops 
would work with their Salva
doran counterparts in civilian 
projects such as building schools 
in El Salvador. This, the pam
phlet argued, would allow the 
Pentagon to maintain a pres
ence in Central America and 
bolster the Salvadoran militarys 
battered public image, the same 
military that the U.N. Truth 
Commission said was implicated 
in a vast majority of human 
rights abuses for over a decade. 
The result of these projects is a 
campaign of militarization anti
thetical to the spirit of the Ac
cords.
Fabian urged members of the 
audience to write letters to their 
respective Congressmen so as to 
apply political pressure to the 
U.S. government to stop inter
vening in the politics of El Sal
vador. She also invited those in
terested to oversee the upcom
ing elections.
In the civil war, the FMLN 
took up arms against govern
ment forces. Fabian herself was 
involved in the battle. In fact, 
she has been involved in politics
1980, she joined FMLN and in 
1992, the MAM.
In a country that is staunchly 
Catholic, might there be a lack of 
popular support for, or even hos
tility toward FMLNs pro-choice 
platform? Fabian said that there 
was popular support among El 
Salvadoran women for MAM. 
Echoing former first lady Bar
bara Bush, Fabian said being prochoice was an individuals per
sonal choice.
Amember ofthe audience asked 
Fabian if MAMs leftist allies were 
merely paying lip service to the 
women of MAM. Was FMLNs 
support of MAM merely to gamer 
a greater number of votes in a 
country where women make up 
54 percent of the population?
Fabian calmly replied that the 
FMLN was in solidarity with the 
womens movement and that both 
groups shared common goals. If 
the MAM were ever taken advan
tage of, it would immediately 
withdraw its support for FMLN. 
However, Fabian neglected to 
elaborate with specifics on how 
the leftistidealscouldhelp MAMs 
cause.
When asked if the economic 
policies of the governing ARENA 
party were more successful than 
the oppositions, Fabian pointed 
out that opposition groups never 
received enough funding to make 
their economic plans a reality. 
Since ARENA received the lions 
share of funding, it was easier for 
them to implement and enforce 
policies.
If many of the MAM candidates 
get elected, this election would be 
epochal in El Salvadors history. 
It would provide political power, 
and most importantly, encourage
ment for a womens movement 
that is a fresh upstart in a coun
try recently wracked by war.
The talk was sponsored by 
CISPES (the Committee In Soli
darity with the People of El Sal
vador), Pitt Campus Womens 
Organization, CMU Women's 
Center, CMU Political Forum 
Board, and the Alliance for Pro-since the age of 15 when she

CMU drama to start graduate 
program with Moscow school
By DANIELLA TOPOL
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
For the first time, the Carnegie 
Mellon Drama Department and 
the Moscow Art Theatre School 
(MAXT) are coordinating a Mas
ters of Fine Arts program for 
professional training in acting. 
This one-year program, sched
uled to commence in June ofl994, 
will accept 12 to 15 Englishspeaking students from any
where in the world. Graduates of 
this program will receive a joint 
Masters of Fine Arts degree in
acting from -------------
Carnegie Mellon 
Drama and the 
MAXT school.
We had been 
thinking for a 
long time about 
a graduate act
ing program. It 
was by sheer 
chance that we 
[MAXT and 
Carnegie Mellon  
Drama] both 
had a need for this program, 
says Elisabeth Orion, head of 
the CMU Drama Department.
For the first six weeks, stu
dents will be training at The 
Stanislavsky Summer School in 
Cambridge, Massachusetts. 
There they will be taught the 
Stanislavsky approach to acting 
and work on pieces of scenes di
rected exclusively by professors 
from the MAXT school. The stu
dents will then study at Carnegie 
Mellon University for the fall 
semester, before they travel to 
Moscow to study at the MAXT 
school from January until June.
During the course of the year, 
these young actors will work collectively on two productions, a
REM, from page L2
Oh no someones coming up 
She has it reserved!

So, me being the social

decided to set my woes to

Every time
I have to use a cluster Im 
Checking over my shoulder 
Trying to keep an eye for them 
Like a criminal on the run 
Oh no, its due Tuesday
How can I get all this done 
Without getting kicked off?
Ill go to Hunt
I thought that I heard them 
laughing 
I thought that I heard them say 
Theres a class in here! Go 
away!
But that was not a dream
classical Russian drama and a 
classical American drama.
This will give the students 
enough time to study each of the 
plays intensively, to learn about 
the playwright and the cultural 
basis and roots that these plays 
are representing, says Mladen 
Kiselov, directing and acting 
teacher. They will have a year to 
focus on the cultural treasures of 
two countries.
In addition, these students will 
be taking intensive voice and 
speech classes, taught by Ameri
can professors from Carnegie
rience the West African Drum and Dance En
semble with a director from the University of 
Pittsburgh.
In addition, African arts and crafts were exhib
ited and on sale to the community. People had the 
________________________________ opportunity to expe
rience the traditional 
crafts of Africa from 
Olebile Anderson of 
Botswana. Olebile 
makes baskets from 
the Okovango Delta 
region of northwest
ern Botswana.
A PARADE OF 
COSTUMES, a vi
brant display of traditional Africian at
tire, was also pre
sented. The parade included a toast to the ances
tors in the Yoruba language of Nigeria, and tradi
tional African drummers; it also featured a fashion 
show of exotic costumes and vibrant colors.
The International Festival was a great opportu
nity for both students, faculty, and the community
1 concerts exposed audiences to a repetoire of sounds 
from traditional to contemporary. Some of the 
performances involved direct interaction. People 
had an opportunity to play along with a master 
Zarian drummer, sing along and dance on stage 
African style with Ladysmith Black Mambazo,
J(bellydance with an experienced dancer, and expe- to learn about a culture they might not know about.
Crowded clusters have students singing blues
That was not a dream 
Thats me in the comer 
Thats me jumping up and down 
Losing my sanity 
Trying to get a grip 
And I dont know if I can do it 
Oh no, its Tueday morning 
 Its still not quite done 
I thought that the class 
was laughing 
I thought that I heard 
them say 
You lost three letter 
grades! Ha ha!!
The acting resources are spread so 
thin right now that it is difficult to 
work. This graduate program would 
solve this problem.

the classroom without taking 
away any of their performance 
time, says Orion.
Jennifer Bloomfield, secondyear graduate playwright, says, 
The acting resources are spread 
so thin right now that it is diffi
cult to work. This graduate pro
gram would solve this problem. 
The details of which professors 
will be working on this program 
and where space will be found to 
accommodate these students has 
yet to be determined.
Heidi Marshall, senior direct
ing major, says,
Mellon, and advanced movement 
classes, taught exclusively by 
Russian professors from the 
MAXT school. There will be a 
cultural focus as well. Students 
will study Russian and American 
cultural heritage and the Rus
sian language. This graduate 
degree in acting will not only be a 
result of intensive training but 
also a result ofthe students touch 
with different theatres and liv
ing cultures, says Kiselov.
While studying at Carnegie 
Mellon, these graduate acting 
students will also be working with 
graduate playwrights and designers with Carnegie Mellons 
Drama facilities.
This will ease the workload for
One problem 
might be the 
lack of facilities. 
Before I say 
whether this 
program would 
be bad or good, I 
would like to 
know how it 
would affect un
dergraduate
.......... students.
I have heard 
from so many people that when 
you go to a conservatory like 
Carnegie Mellon, you dont need 
to go to graduate school, says 
Tina Benko, senior acting major. 
But this sounds like an ideal 
program. You can get your 
Masters degree in only one year, 
you wouldnt be away from the 
professional world for too long, 
and you would be studying in 
Russia.
Both Carnegie Mellon Univer
sity and the MAXT school have 
given their full support to this 
program. It is very encouraging 
that the university and adminis
tration approve of this. We 
couldnt have done it without their 
support, says Orion._________
Language, Culture and the Arts
Two options for French study in Southern France.
In Aix-en-Provence 
study intensive elementary 
or intermediate French 
or combine French with 
courses in literature, 
history, civilization, art 
history, international 
relations and business 
(some taught in English).
In Avignon, 
study French literature, 
art history, culture, 
history (in French). 
Live with a French family, 
excursions (e.g. museums, 
Provence and the 
"French Riveria"), films, 
lectures, on art history 
and politics.
And that was not a 
_____ dream!
(Why? Why? Why? 
Aaaahhhhh!!)
That was not a dream ...
Not a dream.... damn....

Attention H&SS Seniors 
and Others Doing H&SS Double Majors:
Imagine that someone offered you gl3,UUU and a year to study something that 
has interested you for a long time, that excites you a lot, and that would require 
travel abroad in one or more cultures different from your own. Would that 
interest you, and what would you do?
An H&SS Alumni Study/Travel Fellowship
can make this possible for you!
The H&SS Alumni Study/Travel Fellowship seeks to enable a bachelor's candidate

DIVERSIONS
Blood Wedding showcases undergraduate talent
By TARAZANE
Tartan Assistant Diversions Editor
It was great to see that a lot of stu
dents chose to entertain their parents on 
Parents Weekend by taking them to see 
the fall CMU drama production of Blood 
Wedding. The cast of 18 students per
formed their third show to a sold out 
crowd in Kresge Theatre on Saturday, 
October 23.
Playwright Federico Garcia Lorca 
wrote Blood Wedding (Bodas de Sangre) 
based on his Spanish culture, yet em
phasized the universal theme of love, 
honor, and vengeance. The play is a 
tragedy centering around the anxiety of 
a mother who is haunted by the deaths 
of her husband and eldest son. Her fear 
of death does not concentrate on dying, 
but rather on the result of death  the 
foreboding end of her blood line. Natu
rally, this apprehension causes her to be 
extremely paranoid and protective of 
her only other immediate family mem
ber, her son, who is about to wed.
Since the majority of the cast and crew 
of Blood Wedding were freshmen and 
sophomores, I honestly wasnt expect
ing much from this play. Especially af
ter seeing the Tony award winning play, 
Dancing At Lughnasa, a couple weeks 
ago, I was certain that Blood Wedding 
would simply pale miserably in com
parison. However, to my surprise, Blood 
Wedding held my attention from its be
ginning, with the figure of death lurking 
in the opening scene, to its tragic and 
moving finale.
The set design of stucco houses and 
clay tile adornment help to communi
cate the Spanish setting well. Mobile 
backdrops allowed for smooth scene 
changes without confusion or time de
lay. The moon, which was repeatedly
lowered and raised from the ceiling, pre
sented an added dimension to the stage 
as did the hole in floor from which death 
apparently disappeared into the ground. 
Costumes were appropriately designed 
with a Spanish flair as well. The women 
wore especially authentic Spanish at
tire with full patterned skirts, draped 
mantas over their shoulders 
and mantillas over their 
heads. Spanish music also 
accompanied many scenes, 
serving to intensify either 
the festivities or the sever
ity of the occurring events.
I enjoyed the direction of 
Blood Wedding because the 
actors were not confined to 
the stage. Instead, they 
moved through the audi
ence, exiting and entering 
through the back doors of 
the theatre. At one point, 
the young men and women 
even sang from outside the 
theatre in the CFA foyer to 
present an image of them 
running off into the distance 
as their voices faded slowly 
away. The way death was 
portrayed in Blood Wedding 
also added an interesting ef
fect to the play. At first, 
death was a black entity on 
stage seemingly invisible to 
the actors; death subtly 
moved furniture on stage, 
yet was never acknowl
edged. In the second half of 
the play, however, death appears as an old beggar 
woman who actually speaks 
to the bridegroom and three 
young girls. Garcia de
I was excited to see a lot of
familiar faces performing on stage. 
Whether I knew the actors personally or 
not, it was exciting to finally see tan
gible results of their work. Unlike other 
majors like writing, design, mathemat
ics, or science, it is almost impossible to 
see concrete samples of the daily work 
that drama majors complete. I have al
ways had a high regard for students in 
drama, because I assumed that they had 
a lot of talent if they were studying at 
CMU. However, I never knew to what 
degree their talent extended. Therefore, 
Blood Wedding was certainly an insight
ful performance that not only ended 
much of my curiosity, but also made me
aware of what makes these students so 
special. Blood Wedding will be playing 
at Kresge Theatre on October 2123, 
2630 at 8 pm. Student tickets are avail
able for $5 each at the drama box office 
in the College of Fine Arts building. Pick 
up a ticket today, or reserve one by 
calling 268-2407.

New Transformers different from old
I figured that after six col
umns it was about time I re
viewed a Marvel comic, since 
they used to be the best in the 
business. So, on Wednesday I 
went down to the comic shop 
and tried to decide which Mar
vel book I should pick up. I 
thought maybe Namor, since 
Bill Everett is back writing it 
again. I always liked Everetts 
book until prices started to sky
rocket. Excalibur was also a 
choice even though it became 
really lame without Alan Davis 
and Paul Neary. Then there 
was the Midnight Sons that is 
starting a new crossover. I even 
would have bought one of those 
silly Clive Barker books (the 
next Stephen King ... yeah, 
right). They all would have suf
ficed, but what I really hoped
Comic Book Chronicles
By Jason Andracki
for was a new book to come out so 
I could review something differ
ent.
My wish was granted when I 
spotted the first issue of Trans
formers Generation 2. This made 
me really happy because the origi
nal Transformers series (along 
with GI Joe) was one of my first 
favorite books and Ive been re
ally nostalgic about my youth 
lately. Just the sight of Optimus 
Prime brought back thoughts of 
great animated movies and one 
of the best cartoon series ever.
Oddly enough, I just saw 
some Transformers toys this 
summer among the ex
tremely overpriced toys lin
ing the shelves of the now 
defunct Childrens Palace. 
Wow, what memories! My 
search was over. I not only 
found a book to review, but I 
found something from Mar
vel that I might enjoy.
Is it really necessary for 
Marvel to launch every new 
series with a gimmick cover? 
I dont think so. Anyway, the 
front cover is kmda nice; its 
foil-stamped and folds out in 
the middle. Optimus Prime 
looks especially chrome with 
foil highlights. There is a 
heading above the title, This 
is not your fathers Autobot, 
Please see COMICS, page L10
 1993 Marvel Comics 
What Transformers book would be 
complete without Megatron?
As he did in Night Shift and Skeleton Crew, Stephen King once 
again reminds us that the short story is his forte. Nightmares and 
Dreamscapes, an 800-page adventure into the weirder, more horrific 
aspects of fife, and brings back the punch of Kings older works.
From the nostalgic Head Down, a New Yorker piece on little 
league baseball, to the almost insane The Moving Finger, King 
brings his signature touch to all topics strange and small. The two 
vampire stories of the bunch, The Night Flier and Popsy bring 
Dracula into the contemporary world, with customary King 
creepieness.
The stories are ... different, as usual. You Know They Got a Hell 
of a Band is a twist on Rock and Roll Heaven, whch is located in 
Oregon just a few miles off of U.S. 97. Here, Buddy Holly and Roy 
Orbison jam as ghosts, zombies, or worse. Jim Morrison has a cameo 
as the local pool shark and Janis Joplin is the local waitress. Throw 
in the fact that Rock and Roll will never die and youve got one 
disturbing story.
King also tries his hand at a teleplay with a short story called 
Sorry, Right Number that aired on Tales from the Darkside in the 
Amazing Stories days of television. The tome is concluded with a 
poem on baseball and a retelling of an Indian folktale in customary 
King color.
The stories are long and the intensity is fierce. Like most King 
fiction, you could say he is overwriting in this huge collection. 
However, thats half the fun. The bigger the better is evidently Kings 
attitude and Dreamscapes and Nightmares proves this point.
Ladysmith Black Mambazo entertains
By JOHN BIGGS
Tartan Staffwriter
I have Paul Simons Graceland, 
but I had never heard Ladysmith 
Black Mambazo without Simons 
vocals leading them in Home
less or any of the other South 
African-influenced songs on that 
release. I have had very little 
experience with the group, but 
their style of music attracted me. 
I enjoyed the tribal rhythms and 
the simplistic yet infinitely mov
ing patterns they created on 
Simons disc, so I decided to see 
them in concert. I was pleasantly 
surprised.
Ladysmith Black Mambazo de
stroyed language barriers and 
brought the music of an incred
ibly diverse culture to me for the 
first time in its unadulterated, 
uncommercialized form. They 
were real, for lack of a better 
word, and as deep and vibrant as 
the desert sun sweeping the 
mountains into bed that they sang 
about at one point. The group of 
men sang, danced, and clowned 
on stage, bringing the audience 
up to the stage to try their hand 
at Zulu expression. It was beau
tiful and hilarious to see women 
wearing staid suitcoats and sen
sible shoes hooting out I love
you, babe both in their native 
language and in English.
I felt the concert was a wonder
ful way to begin the International 
Festival. Ladysmith Black Mam
bazo was almost an incarnation 
of the cliche that music can be 
loved by anyone. Even with all 
the problems in South Africa (the 
problems I associate with the
country more than the people and 
culture), these men have created 
something joyous and glad. From 
laments over lost lovers to warn
ings against pregnancy, the Afri
can folk sounds of the group still 
linger on in my memory. Their 
recording Shaka Zulu was 
awarded a Grammy for Best Tra
ditional Music Recording in 1988.
Most recently, they appeared in 
the 1993 Broadway production of 
The Song of Jacob Zulu. They 
appeared in A Dry White Season 
and Coming to America as well. 
Evidently, they also did a 7-Up 
commerical which I must have 
missed. But after seeing them in 
concert for the first time, I will 
not miss them again.

Transformers return
COMICS, from page L9 I wasnt expecting much from this book,
jjvhich sounds really corny but makes but, to my surprise, I am very satisfied 
Sense after you read author Simon with it. I wont feel silly buying this book 
Furmans note at the end of the issue, in along with more adult books like Sandtyhich he explains that this book isnt man.
tied to the Transformers toy line like the Im glad there is a Marvel book out

kid-oriented. This book is a little more hasnt happened for such a long time 
psychological with fewer mindless that I think Im going to go home and 
battles. Its a perfect mixture of the two. play with my old Transformers toys. 
Also, the Autobots dont seem as goodyftwo-shoes as they did when it was more Jason Andracki is a freshman profes6f a kids book. Actually, some of them sional writing major. When hes not busy 
seem downright ruthless. Rather than playing with his Autobots, he likes to 
just having the heroes wearing stereo- read letters of response to his column. If 
typical white hats, I like to see them youd like to drop him a line, send it to 
portrayed more realistically. Comic Book Chronicles, clo Diversions,
' -The inside cover shows Megatron and The Tartan, Skibo 50.
Starscream, so I know 
theyll be back sometime.
The back cover adds a nice 
touch, serving to intro
duce new readers to the 
Transformers story and 
refresh the memories of 
old readers like myself.
For $2.95 it wasnt too bad 
since there are 37 pages 
of story plus ads.
Overall, the interior art 
by newcomer Derek 
Yaniger is good, but he 
seems to have trouble 
drawing humans. The 
panel with the G.I. Joe 
team is too cartoonish and 
the token female looks a 
lot like Sharon Stone.
However, the robots are 
perfect. Yaniger puts 
great detail into them and 
even the backgrounds are 
decent.
Furman, the last 
scripter of the original se
ries, writes this one well.
However, I think he tried 
to cram a little too much 
into this issue. It seems 
choppy, but I think the 
longer he writes for this 
book the smoother the 
storytelling will become.

Night of the Living Dead
This 1968 classic was horror-master George 
Romeros (Creepshow, Dawn of the Dead, Mon
key Shines, Season of the Witch) first feature 
film. In its time, this film was the pinnacle of 
scariness. Although it may pale in gore com
parison to todays horror films, it still manages 
to hold some of that aura of creepiness.
Seven people are forced to barricade them
selves inside a farmhouse as an army of flesheating zombies roam their town.
This film was followed by a sequel and a 1990 
color remake, but neither could quite match 
the true intensity of the original.
A must see for all horror fans, a fun scare for 
the rest.
At 6, 8,10 pm, and midnight.
Friday, October 29
Army of Darkness
Another master of horror films, Sam Raimi 
(Evil Dead, Evil Dead II, Darkman) brings us 
this comic fantasy film about a 20th-century 
man named Ash who is hurled into the Dark 
Ages by demonic forces.
Armed with an unreliable chainsaw, an ag
ing shotgun, and a 1973 Delta 88 Oldsmobile, 
Ash must help the poor cowering masses of 
peasants from attack by the rising undead.
This film also features lots of neat special 
effects with monsters and stuff, so make sure 
not to miss this if youre a monster fan.
At 6, 8,10 pm, and midnight.

Sleepless in Seattle
Sleepless in Seattle is one of those sweet old 
love stories. So, for those of you who arent up 
for sappiness, people just missing each other 
by a second, and too coincidental coincidences, 
dont go to this. Youll only end up leaving the 
movie thinking about how impossible the in
stances in this movie could be in real life.
But for those of you who like to get lost in a 
love story, definitely go, and then leave crying 
as you realize how this kind of wonderful stuff 
never happens in your life. Well, at least thats 
what I did.
A lot of what happens in the movie is based 
on the classic movie An Affair to Remember 
since thats the movie that Meg Ryan and her 
friend, played by Rosie ODonnell, watch the 
most (as in, they have the whole script memo
rized).
It stars Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks as the two 
people who cant ever manage to find each 
other. But if I tell you what happens, then you 
wont go, and I need to leave something to the 
imagination. Oh, and its pretty funny too, so 
then you can also laugh at how this kind of 
wonderful stuff never never happens in your 
life.
At 6, 8,10 pm, and midnight.
