Duringthe spring ofl993, Com
puting Services sent a survey to 
720 undergraduates about their 
ise of computers and their attinides toward the possibility of 
iniversity-provided computers 
^"Computing Services considers 
' iandatory computer ownership," 
1/8/93],
In a preliminary report dated 
:july 8,1993, an analysis of the 
esults were taken from the 437 
etumed questionnaires, and ac
cording to William Arms, vice 
president of Computing Services, 
equiring the purchase of comiuters is completely out.
Arms said that before major 
decision are made, information 
,ust be gathered. We discovred that we do have a problem, 
aid Arms.
According to the results of the 
lurvey, 16 percent of the sureyed students said they have 
equent problems finding a com
puter in a public computer clusber than expected. He said that 
those who do have personal commet with Paul Christiano, pro

and IBM 386 machines.
The basic conclusion is that 
student ownership seems to be 
desirable but financially diffi
cult, Arms said.
The survey indicated that 12 
percent of the students said that
ter, and 62 percent said that they cost would not be a problem, 32
have had occasional problems. 
These numbers are higher than 
!*id like to see, said Arms.
I According to Arms, the survey 
also said that about 40 percent of 
the surveyed students have their 
own personal computer. Arms 
said that that was a lower numpercent said it would be a minor 
problem, and 29 percent said they 
would have serious difficulties.
A CMU education is very ex
pensive, and [the students] are 
very outspoken against an in
crease in that, said Arms.
As a result of the survey, Arms
kamsey Hong/ lartan Art tditor 
dent for enrollment; and Erwin 
Steinberg, vice provostfor educa
tion; to discuss the problem of 
making computers accessible to 
students.
There is no long-term answer, 
said Arms. We dont use the clus
ters.
Therefore, Arms said that the 
committee will add three faculty 
members and two to four mem
bers of Student Senate to discuss 
the problem further.
Possible solutions included 
separate computer clusters for 
faculty and students, restricted 
teaching in public computer clus
ters, expanding the clusters or 
the number of classrooms with 
computers, and student owner-- 
ship of computing equipment.
Theres very little thats actu
ally required by this university, 
said Arms. The dilemma is that 
were a computer-intensive uni
versity, and we want to do ad
vanced things. A solid computer 
is a lot of money.
Arms said the committee has 
not made any recommendation 
to the university.
The survey said that three per
cent of the students surveyed 
spend less than one hour per week 
at a computer, 22 percent said 
between one hour a day and one 
hour a week, 58 percent said one 
to four hours a day, and 16 per
cent said more than four hours a 
day.
Only 52 percent of the students 
said they are taking a course that 
requires the use of computers.
According to the survey, about 
three-quarters of the students 
consider that owning a computer 
is an advantage, and more than a 
quarter consider it to be a consid
erable advantage.
With the exception of IM, there 
was little difference in these fig
ures among the colleges.
About half of the IM students 
surveyed thought having a per
sonal computer was a consider
able advantage.New Hunt Library hours anger students, spark petition drive
[Hunt] is the one place where people can go after midnight'
By DECLAN McCULLAGH

In a move that angered hundreds of stu
dents, the university librarian last month 
nounced that Hunt Library will close at 
nidnight during the school year.
\. The library, which was previously open 
until 3 a.m., does not get enough use after 
midnight to justify keeping it open any 
later, said University Librarian Charles 
Lowry. The use after midnight was not 
for library purposes.
This announcement prompted some 
Students to take steps to voice their dis
content. With the assistance of Student 
enator Kevin Goldman (H&SS), senior 
nglish major Heather Broud collected 
ibout 500 signatures on a petition askigthe administration to change its mind. ___
Broud believes the administration * 
idnt consult students about their needs.
I think that at CMU its important for th 
.ministration to listen to the students. The 
library is the one place where people can go 
er midnight, said Broud.
Not according to the librarians, according 
;o Lowry. The veteran library administrator
says library data indicate that students who 
are in the library after midnight are usually 
there to study or to use the computer cluster, 
not to do research.
The use of the library was'not for library 
purposes. We made an economic decision, 
said Lowry, adding that there are other 
clusters and study areas open late at night.
In addition, said Lowry, the new hours

According to Broud, the library is more 
than just a place to do research, and the 
hours should reflect that need. The library

used to access resources, to meet and work 
with people, and to study late at night, said 
Broud.
The decision to close the library early origi
nated when Faculty Senate discussed the 
topic last school year. A Faculty Senate com
mittee advised the library on the change in 
hours, said Mark Kantrowitz, a graduate 
student and member of the committee. The 
Faculty Senate and Provost Paul 
----- Christiano approved the changes.
According to the library studies, the 
library usage past midnight was com
paratively less... In an ideal world, the 
library would be open 24 hours, said 
Kantrowitz.
However, if students need to hit the 
books or the keyboards, there are other 
places for them to go, says Kantrowitz. 
Students can make use of alternative 
study areas and clusters, including 
rooms in Baker Hall, said Kantrowitz.
Also, students can access library services 
electronically from other locations on cam
pus, noted the computer science graduate 
student.
They will have extended hours near fi
nals, said Kantrowitz.

Republicans issue 
health care reforms
WASHINGTON, August 30, (DJ)
 Twenty-four Republican senators 
have issued a health care reform pro
posal that disagrees with employer 
mandates, cost controls and global 
budgets as ways to lower U.S. health
care costs.
The statement, published by the 
Senate RepublicanHealth Care Task 
Force and released by Sen. Christo
pher Kit Bond (R-Mo.), comes at a 
time when House and Senate lead
ers, as well as President Clinton, 
have called for a bipartisan effort to 
help speed health-care reform 
through Congress.
While Clinton is considering sev
eral options to fund coverage for uninsuredAmericansandtolimithealth 
expenditures overall, the Republi
cans, who include Senate Minority 
Leader Robert Dole (R-Kan.) are fo
cusing on cost-saving measures 
rather than new taxes to fund re
form, Bond said.
Limiting the deductibility of health 
care benefits  currently employers 
can deduct 100 percent of the cost  
and increasing the number of people 
who can deduct their health care ex
penditures will save billions of dol
lars, Bond said.
For example, companies that pro
vide health care plans which cover all 
costs provide no incentive for em
ployees to control how much they 
spend on health care, Bond said.
Limiting deductibility would allow 
employers to return that extra money 
in wages and salaries, thus creating 
about $30 billion more in taxable 
income, he added.
, President Clinton plans to begin 
consultations on his health care plan 
with Democratic and Republican 
members of Congress next week, be
fore making final decisions on the 
proposal he is to unveil later this 
month, The Wall Street Journal re
ported.
Clinton spent about two hours be
hind dosed doors with top health and 
economic advisers yesterday debat
ing how quickly and tightly to cap 
public and private health spending 
under his plan to guarantee health 
insurance to all Americans.
Officials said no decisions were 
made during the session, but they 
expect the president to make pre
liminary decisions on major financ
ing provisions this week.
One of the issues is how much sav
ings can be wrung out of public health 
programs such as Medicare, the fed
eral health insurance program for 
the elderly and disabled, and Medic
aid, the federal-state health program 
for the poor.
Afraid to propose a big new round 
of taxes after last months bitter bud
get battle, the administration is look
ing for ways to wring savings from 
projected spending in Medicare and 
Medicaid to finance parts of the plan. 
(The president, however, is consider
ing proposing between $10 billion and 
$20 billion in increased excise taxes 
on cigarettes and alcoholic beverages.)
Butofficials stressedyesterday that 
they will rechannel Medicare sav
ings to pay for expanding Medicare 
benefitssuch as adding a prescrip
tion drug benefit to the program and 
establishing a new long-term care 
plan  and not to pay for health 
insurance for nonelderly people.
OneofficialsaidthatlraMagaziner, 
the White House aide running the 
health care effort, has presented op
tions ranging from squeezing $240 
billion out of Medicare and Medicaid 
over five years to something closer to 
$100 billion.
Officials stress that they are also 
planning to slow private health spend
ing, through limits on the rate of 
increase in health insurance premi
ums and a variety of other measures. 
But some officials are arguing that 
public health programs cant be 
slowed as fast as the private sector, 
because there is more excess in pri
vate health spending.
The White House issued a state
ment saying that Clinton ruled out 
Nixon-type price controls on health 
care. He also has emphasized the 
need to control spiraling costs and 
said the final proposed health care 
reform will contain several mecha
nisms for doing that in both the short 
and long-term. The statement didnt 
say what those measures would be.
Clinton noted that outlays for Medi
care and Medicaid have been rising 
at a rate much faster than other ar
eas of the budget.
In the media guidance, the admin
istration also said that the govern
ment will take steps to prevent firms 
seeking to make excessive profits 
during the transition to a new health 
care system.
Peace opponents plan Anti-PLO meeting
AMMAN, JORDAN, September 5 (AP)
 Palestinian sources say ten factions 
that oppose the Mideast peace process 
plan to step up their campaign against 
the proposal for limited self-rule.
A representative of the fundamental
ist Hamas movement said a meeting is 
being planned to coordinate opposition. 
Palestinian activists said it could take 
place in two weeks.
The deal between Israel and the Pal
estine Liberation Organization (PLO) 
has splintered Palestinians.
PLO chief Yasser Arafat is capitalhopping in the Arab world, trying to line 
up supporters. He said the agreement is 
near completion.
Irans Islamic fundamentalist govern
ment is saying it opposes the pact, and 
has warned PLO members not to be
come involved.
Arafat met in Syria for a meeting with 
an old opponent  Syrian President 
Haffez Assad. He said hes in Damascus 
to consult with Assad and listen to his 
good advice.
Syria hasnt taken a public position on 
the plan for Palestinian limited self-rule 
in part of Israels occupied territories, 
and has heavy influence among Pales
tinian leaders who will vote on the plan.
Arafat called the situation crucial and 
destiny-making.
He said the Palestinians and Israelis 
are on the verge of completing an agree
ment on mutual recognition, but that 
there are still some obstacles that stand 
in the way.Clinton asks for Senate vote on NAFTA proposal
WASHINGTON, August 31 (DJ) 
President: Clinton said that to help-his 
endangered prioritythe North Ameri
can Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)  
he would be willing to accept the un
usual procedure of allowing the Senate 
to vote before the more reluctant House, 
The Wall Street Journal reported.
The White House also is moving to
ward asking a high-profile Republican 
to help it pass the trade pact with former 
Minnesota Rep. Bill Frenzel as the likely 
choice.
In a news conference yesterday, the 
president also acknowledged that there 
were problems with the latest, botched 
American assault on a Somalian war
lord, which resulted instead in an attack 
on a United Nations outpost. In addi
tion, Clinton delineated more precise, 
restrictive criteriafor sendingU.S. forces
to Bosnia.
Clinton made clear he remains com
mitted to approving the free-trade ac
cord which would gradually dismantle 
trade barriers among the U.S., Canada 
and Mexico. But he also made a bow to 
the difficulty of getting the pact ap
proved by Congress, especially the 
House, by saying he was open to a 
suggestion by Senate Republican Leader 
Robert Dole of Kansas to let the Senate 
vote first.
Usually, trade measures originate in 
the House. But vote-counters acknowl
edge that given the large Democratic 
opposition to the accord, there arent yet 
enough votes there to approve NAFTA. 
The Senate, in contrast, is far more 
likely to ratify it. So White House strat
egists believe that Senate approval of 
the pact would put pressure on the House 
to pass it.
A decision hasnt been made, Clinton 
said. But aides said the White House is 
moving into high gear to approve the 
measure. Calls were made to Demo
cratic and Republican supporters of 
NAFTA yesterday, and plans are being 
laid to organize pressure from businesses 
nationwide.U.S., Russia join forces to build space station
WASHINGTON, September 3 (DJ)  
In an agreement that turns a generation 
of space rivalry on its head, the U.S. and 
Russia announced plans to explore build
ing an international space station to
gether.
After years of racing each other to 
orbit the first satellite, put humans into 
space, land on the moon, and explore 
Mars, the two countries are on a fast 
track to potentially merging their larg
est civil space projects.
Concluding two days of talks here on 
space and energy cooperation, Vice Presi
dent A1 Gore and Russian Prime Minis
ter Viktor Chernomyrdin agreed that 
both countries could cut costs and devel
opment time by sharing in space explo
ration, accordingto The Wall Street Jour
nal. They announced immediate steps to 
begin more joint space missions and to 
build an interim space platform that 
both Russian cosmonauts and U.S. as
tronauts could visit as early as 1997, 
years before the U.S. could hope to have 
a space station in orbit.
But their most dramatic plans were 
illustrated at a news conference in a 
black-and-white drawing of preliminary 
plans for a U.S.Russian space station. 
It included pieces of hardware from 
Americas current space-station part
ners, Japan, Europe and Canada, al
though these partners have only begun 
to be consulted on a merger.
Neither the U.S. nor Russia will de
cide on whether to approve the plans 
until a study is completed by November 
1 and after their own political and na
tional security concerns are addressed 
at home. But the maturity of the merger; 
plans and openness and optimism sur
prised some space experts who had ex
pected a slower, more cautious approach.
The United States and Russia aro: 
convinced that a unified space station: 
can offer significant advantages to all: 
concerned, the two sides said. The joint'.' 
statement said approval of a merger" 
hinged on satisfying technical and part
nership considerations.
Probably the most important thing is 
the political message it (the space coop
eration) sends, that were serious about 
cooperating with them, said Gabriel 
Schoenfeld, a Russian studies expert at* 
the Center for Strategic and Interna-- 
tional Studies.Seven Nigerian peacekeepers die in Somalia
MOGADISHU, SOMALIA, September
5 (AP)  United Nations officials are 
blaming Somali warlord Mohamed 
Farrah Aidid for an ambush in which 
sevenNigerian peacekeepers were killed.
Seven others were wounded and one 
may have been captured. An American: 
diplomat was shot in the chest when he 
andfive colleagues apparently stumbled 
onto the ambush.
Americas representative in Somalia 
said the diplomat is in fair to good condi
tion. He said the Americans were driv
ing to a meeting in northern Mogadishu' 
when they were fired upon.
The United Nations special envoy to' 
Somalia is denouncing todays ambush \ 
as a wanton, unprovoked, and premedi
tated attack.
The United Nations said it was the 
deadliest ambush since July 2, when: 
three Italian peacekeepers were killed 
and 30 wounded. So far, 46 UN peace
keepers have been killed since the world: 
body took over the humanitarian mis
sion in May.
UN Military Spokesman Major David 
Stockwell said the Nigerians were am
bushed in the same general area where 
the Italians were killed two months ago.
Stockwell is blaming fugitive warlord 
Aidid for the attack. Aidid has been 
wanted since a June ambush that left 24 
Pakistani troops dead.

New library hours do 
not serve students
University Librarian Charles 
Lowry has announced that, start
ing this semester Hunt Librarys 
hours have changed so that on 
weekdays it now closes at mid
night instead of 3 am as it has in 
the past. We feel that this is a bad 
decision backed with poor reason
ing. The first problem is the deci
sion process itself: students were 
not actively involved. Student Gov
ernment was not consulted as it 
should have been; this is precisly 
the kind of situatioh for which it 
exists. Although Lowry and the 
library administration did invite 
other students to the meetings on 
the topic, these meetings were held 
at noon when most students are 
too busy to attend. These points 
make it seem as though gathering 
the opinions of undergraduate stu
dents was an afterthought that 
mattered little in the overall deci
sion process.
The arguments that Lowry has 
given are also dubious. One reason 
given is that by closing at mid
night Hunts schedule will syn
chronize with the E&S Librarys 
hours. The best way of achieving 
this would be to increase E&S 
hours, not the opposite; CIT, MCS, 
and SCS students have long com
plained about the hours there. 
Another reason cited by the ad
ministration is that over one third 
of the people in the library are only 
using the Apple Orchard cluster, 
located in the basement of Hunt. 
This is an absurd justification to 
close the library earlier; if any
thing should be done because of 
this fact, Hunt should be open even
Recently, students who were in
terested in attending Carnegie 
Mellons Centre de Tours program 
of study abroad in France have 
been informedby Emily Bianchini, 
the advisor for the program, that 
the Centre is closing. This is a 
great loss to the students of CMU, 
but perhaps can also be looked on 
as a lesson for the administration.
Tours died for a number of rea
sons. Losing money semester after 
semester is a big one. Lack of inter
ested students is another. But all 
the blame for the programs de
mise cant be pinned solely on the 
student body of CMU.
Tours was the only program 
available to CMU students that 
guaranteed that all financial aid 
would be useable. To study in an
other country, or through another 
schools program, meant there was 
a good chance that it would not be 
completely covered by financial aid.
It is admirable that CMU took 
the initiative to establish a foreign 
campus for its students. However, 
had more preliminary work been 
done to study the feasibility and 
practicality of setting up the Cen
tre de Tours, the end result might 
have been more happy.
Once again, problems with the 
administration seem to stem from 
a lack of student involvement in 
the decision process. How much 
research was done internally to 
rate the possible interest in a pro
gram that was essentially CMU in 
a different city?
A foreign campus of our own
longer to allow students to use the 
cluster. Simply moving the com
puters outside the library would 
not work either as many people 
use library resources such as books 
and magazines for work inside the 
cluster.
There is one good thing about 
this whole ordeal: the widespread 
student apathy that generally 
plagues CMU doesnt seem to be 
present. H&SS Senator Kevin 
Goldman and senior English ma
jor Heather Broud took initiative 
and are soliciting a petition that 
protests the changing of Hunts 
hours. We commend Goldman and 
Broud for trying to make students 
voices heard; if you agree with it, 
sign the petitions around campus 
and at the Skibo Information Desk.
Obviously, Hunt Library is a 
valuable resource on campus, so it 
seems odd that the decision to de
crease the hours was made. Many 
students find that Hunt is the only 
good, quiet place to study and get 
work done. The Apple Orchard clus
ter in the basement is one of the 
most used computer clusters and 
has some of the most powerful Macs 
available to students; Lowry and 
the library administration should 
look to the needs of the students 
and realize that the cluster itself is 
a reason to keep the library open. 
Oddly enough, administrators say 
that the reduction is not being done 
for budgetary reasons. If students 
arent benefitting with better fi
nancial management, and we cer
tainly arent winning with shorter 
hours, why shorten the hours at 
all?
meant a number of things. One, no 
problem with the transferability of 
credits. Two, classes taught by 
Carnegie Mellon faculty. Three, 
'your full financial aid package fol
lowed you there to cover expenses.
While the closing of Tours can be 
seen as a failure, the Office of In
ternational Education should learn 
a valuable lesson from this experi
ence. Many students want to study 
abroad, but likely would prefer to 
do so in the country of their choice.
The whole process must become  
more user friendly, where students 
can pick the country of interest, 
apply all of their financial aid to 
their expenses, and receive maxi
mum credit for the courses com
pleted. Scholarships should be set 
up for the sole purpose of aiding 
students who wish to study abroad.
The effort was commendable, but 
flawed. What the Office of Interna
tional Education does next will be 
a testament to its ability to learn 
from its mistake. No more money 
will be needlessly wasted if, in the 
future, it takes the time to listen 
fully to the needs of the student 
body.
The expertise of the Office of In
ternational Education should be 
exploited as a useful resource by 
the student body to enable them to 
make wise decisions and invest
ments. However, student involve
ment is still a mustall the prob
lems of studying abroad should not 
and cannot be left in the hands of 
the Office of International Educa
tion.
Convocation 
was advertised
Editor:
In the newspaper world, editorial writ
ers are careful to check their facts before 
they write accusing editorials. The Tar
tan, however, seems to live in a world of 
its own.
The editorial on the Convocation which 
appeared in the issue of August 30 says, 
Planning for the event could not possibly 
have been more slipshod.... The publicity 
for the convocation consisted of an 81/2 by 
11 inch poster that proclaimed, in rather 
large type, 4:30 Period.
In fact, the publicity for the convocation 
included:
 An Academic Newsletter which was 
mailed to every Carnegie Mellon student 
at his or her home over the summer, the 
first item of which was a story of five 
column inches on the Convocation, The 
Newsletter ended with, Have a good sum
mer  and when you return, join us on 
the Cut for the First Education Convoca
tion at 4:30 pm on Aug. 24 to celebrate the 
opening of the new academic year. (A 
copy is attached.)
 A letter to every department head 
with multiple copies of the Academic 
Newsletter, asking the head to distribute 
it to every faculty member and graduate 
student with a memo urging them to 
attend the convocation

About the poster, the editorial com
mented, Its possible that our fellow stu
dents rememberedthis (the 4:30 in rather 
large type), and wondered, as we did, 
what was happening at 4:30 pm last Tues
day. There was text on the poster ex
plaining what was happening. All one 
had to do was read it.
Those posters, by the way, were not 
posted the day of the event, as the edito
rial claimed. They were posted ten days 
before the event and then were re-posted 
the day of the event with the word today 
on them.
Slipshod planning? No, slipshod jour

Editor:
At the Athletic Banquet on April 28, 
^1993, President Mehrabian promised the 
student-athlete community of CMU that 
the IM practice field would be changed to 
a synthetic turf playing area for the safety
of all CMU athletes and students. Since 
returning to the football team this 
August, we have not seen any change i 
in the type of surface, yet we have seen 
a noticeable deterioration in the con
dition ofthe IM practice area. In speak
ing with the football co-captains, we | 
feel that this field is dangerous and .

done to improve the situation. Last | 
August 31, we witnessed a member ol 
our team step in a hole on the field and  
break his foot. Because of this, we no 
longer feel safe practicing on this field.
As IM president, I not only fear fathe safety of participants when play-! 
ing on the IM field but also for the : 
scheduling problems that rain can i; 
cause.
Manytimes we have not been able to  
complete a full schedule in touch foot |

Hunts new hours are unfair
Jason Heinlein
Hunt library has changed its hours so that it closes at 
midnight instead of 3:00 am.
University Librarian Charles Lowry claims that keeping 
the library open is not feasible because there are not enough 
students using it to justify the $15,000 cost per year for the 
extra three hours.
Many people may look at this money as an incredibly large 
figure that would merit the changing of the hours, but that is 
only if you see the extra hours as benefitting only one person. 
According to Lowry, 120 people, or 3.5% of the total users of 
the library use it after midnight. Now if we consider how many 
students this is benefitting per night, it works out to only $125 
for each of these 120 students for the entire year. That is a 
very small percentage of the $20,000 that they pay for tuition 
each year.
I dont know how much $125 is to you, but I have paid almost 
three times that much for my books this semester, and they 
havent helped me nearly as much as the library has. In 
addition, divide this $15,000 by the total student population, 
and it is even less of a burden. When the question of how the 
university should spend our tuition arises, I think that it 
would be very difficult to find someone who is outraged by 
using it for this reason.
Lets forget about the monetary aspect of the problem for a 
moment and see why it isbeneficial to students to keep the 
library open.
First of all, the library has one ofthe best computer clusters 
on campus. The computers are in good shape and are among 
the most updated on campus.
According to Lowry, there are no plans to relocate this 
cluster, but it is acceptable to close it early because 63% of 
students have access to computers in their dorm rooms. I hate 
to say it, but it seems as though the university is again
forgetting about the 37% of students that are in the minority 
and do not have computers in their rooms. The university ha* 
to realize that they are paying tuition too, and that they must 
not be cast aside and forgotten.
The library is a friendly, safe, and well-furnished environ^ 
ment for learning. The rationale that students can simply us; j 
a room in Baker Hall to study is totally irresponsible. There! 
are so many rooms in Baker that it would be unreasonable til 
expect campus security to keep them all under supervision! 
The rooms are far from comfortable and friendly to a studenil 
who has a very important exam in the near future. The desfc 
may be satisfactory enough to make it through a 50 minute 
class, but are hardy comfortable enough for hours of intense 
studying. Being in the library makes studying somewhat les; 
painful because it is so well suited for it.
Spending hours alone in an ominous Baker Hall room is mj 
idea of Hell.
Many of the students at Carnegie Mellon re forced to holo 
jobs with long hours and low pay so that they can faithfully 
pay their tuition. Unfortunately, many of them will soon fine 
that the university will not use a tiny percentage of their 
money to keep the library open at the only time they hav; 
available to use it.
Perhaps if the University Librarian himself had to tell each1 
of these hard-working students that they have to leave the 
library because it is closing, he would have a different view on 
the subject.
A partial solution to the finals crunch was offered by Lowry 
He said that the library hours would be extended the week 
before classes end so that students can study late. Again, I sec 
problems with only extending the hours at these times. Whec 
it is several weeks before finals, students are likely to say 
Well, I cant use the library this late until the week before 
classes end, and I cant stand studying in my room anymore. 
They will either just give up and go to bed, or decide to -- 
hopelessly  study in the Panther Hollow Inn. Either solu 
tion will have a detrimental effect on the students grades art 
the universitys overall reputation. The students will end uf 
cramming for their final exams even more than they had it

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  7 September 19935
Columnist serious about cows
Declan McCullagh
Those of you lucky enough to have read 
last weeks column may remember I wrote 
about how riding mountain bikes keeps 
Carnegie Mellon policemen from riding 
;cows.
The more perspicacious (from the Latin: 
perspic, meaning to sweat over, and 
;acious, meaning impressive words with 
lots of syllables) of you might be saying at 
.this moment, That idiot! Everyone knows 
people dont ride cows.
. Hah, that shows how smart you are, 
'reader, for it just so happens that they do. 
According to the Academic American 
Encyclopedia, The zebu is a species of 
r hardy domestic cattle that is used as a 
riding animal. Evolved from Indian wild 
cattle, the zebu has a large dewlap.
So you dont know what a dewlap is 
either? At first, I suspected it was some
thing long, moist, sticky, andunmention. able around members of the Moral Ma
jority, but I was wrong. It really is (ac
cording to Websters) lots of loose skin
hanging under the necks of various ani
mals, especially those that look like Rosanne 
Arnold.
No, seriously, it didnt say anything about 
Ms. Arnold, but speaking of aging bovines 
(just kidding!), last year a cow turned 48 
and made it into the Guinness Book of 
World Records.
We should pause here and think of what 
prompts people to get into the Guinness 
Book of World Records.
Most of them seem to think that they 
should be awarded entries for things like, 
Longest Amount of Fettuccine Sucked 
Through Left Nostril and Pulled Out An
other Orifice Using Only My Tongue. While 
that may be entertaining, I wouldnt con
sider it nearly as impressive as being a 48- 
year old cow,which is rather difficult for 
most people.
I mean, have you tried it?
Anyway, the Chicago Tribune reported 
that a cow named Big Bertha celebrated 
her record-breaking birthday by being 
blessed by a Catholic priest. Those nutty 
Catholics! The next thing you know the 
pope will be holding masses in a pasture. 
(Look out for that cow patty, your Holi
ness!)
This marks a trend towards increasing
religious awareness of our barnyard 
friends plight.
In Florida for instance, some people 
were upset by their neighbors holding 
ritual cow sacrifices next door and, sensi
bly enough, passed laws outlawing ani
mal offerings.
The strategy would have worked, ex
cept that the Church of Santeria, which 
mandates these sacrifices, sued the city 
of Hialeah and won.
KIDS: Mommy, mommy. Why is there 
a cow in the neighbors backyard? 
MOTHER: Be quiet, children. The 
Salinis are trying to have a ritual cow 
sacrifice.
KIDS: Why?
MOTHER: Because their religion says 
they should, of course.
KIDS: (excited) Is there going to be 
blood and guts?
MOTHER: Probably lots.
KIDS: (happy) We want to do it too! 
Now what kind of idiots kill cows for 
pleasure and give nasty ideas to already 
demented little kids, you might ask your
self. Theyre the type that probabl@#09fj.
Wait, give me back my keyboard! Help! 
Ouch! Policgakk...
So I would like to take this opportunity
to say that the practices of the Church of 
Santeria make incredible sense, and would 
make even more sense if the Salami broth
ers would kindly give me back my left arm. 
Thank you.
So, being the progressive type of person 
you wish you were, you might ask your
self, What do the cows think about this? 
Hah! You profess to care about the opin
ions of cows even though you regularly 
suck down dehydrated, decaffinated, de
humidified, and deconstructed dead cow 
meat at McDonalds, you simpering lib
eral, you!
But if you really wanted to find out, 
youd have to go to a cow psychologist. 
Such people do exist, and you can be one 
too!
A recent issue of Countryside & Small 
Stock Journal has an article entitled, 
How to be a cattle psychologist, that 
teaches you how to psychoanalyze mem
bers of the bovine persuasion.
I urge all readers to go out and by a copy 
right now. As soon as you finish reading, of 
course.
COW PSYCHOLOGIST: Ah, Bessie.

COW: Moo.
Please see COW, page 6Women get treated like objects
Kris Hinrichs
Garter belts, black lingerie, and oh, 
we mustnt forget the elegantly ar
ranged rose displayed in between her 
breasts. Whoa mama, Cindy 
Crawford at her finest.
No, its not an ad in Cosmo, its a 
flyer which Pi Lambda Phi graciously 
provided to all incoming freshmen 
featuring Cindy Crawford (in the 
above description) and the words 
Gotta Have It! next to her. Before I 
give this classy fraternity any more 
free publicity, Id like to enlighten 
these proud brothers about the im
plications of their flashy advertise
ment and why it is offensive to many fe
males.
Now, I dont consider myself to be a mili
tant feminist, spelling women as womyn or 
any of that sort of crap. I believe in equal 
rights for men and women, and I have 
nothing against sexy clothing or being femi
nine. This flyer is blatantly sexist because 
it treats woman as meat (or like a can of 
Pepsi), something to have, something to 
devour.
Well, boys, its time to grow up and stop 
thinking with your genitals. Women de
serve more respect than to be labeled your 
little playtoys so you can always have a 
good time.
Advertisements like this one encourage 
men to think its OK to treat women merely 
as objects with little regard to the conse
quences; and the consequences are great.
Problems such as eating disorders, low 
self-esteem, and lack of self-confidence 
are provoked by the notion that a woman 
has to be a certain body type or dress a 
particular way to attract men. These mat
ters are magnified when women are placed 
into a new environment, eager to make 
good first impressions.
The media bombards women with pro
paganda on how to look and act, and now 
college campuses are, too? Censorship is 
definitely not the way to approach this 
issue, but I would hope that at a univer
sity which promotes equality and sensi
tivity towards minorities (and women 
are a minority here), an organization 
would have more taste than to sink to this 
kind of unimaginative, degrading 
promotion.Not only does this flyer repre; sent Pi Lambda Phi, it represents all the
fraternities on campus. Being the naive 
little freshman that I am, Im thinking 
about goingto fraternities to meet people, 
dance, and try out the social scene. See
ing the Cindy flyer justifies all my ste
reotypes about fraternities being a place 
where desperate, slimy guys test out 
their newest pickup line on anything in 
spandex. No thanks. Id like the Greek 
council to think how it would reflect on 
their organization if fraternities put up a 
blatantly racist advertisement.
One last note, Pi Lambda Phi. Theres 
more to life than beer and empty-headed 
babes, and if you think your fraternity 
has something else to offer me, your little 
advertisement is a real turn-off.

Senators deserve pay
James S. Brown
As Student Senate begins the newyear, 
it is expected that a large number of seats 
will be vacant. If history is a good indica
tor, the number ofvacancies will increase. 
Were this a powerless body, this fact 
would be irrelevant. However, our Stu
dent Senate receives over $500,000 of 
studentmoney. Further, the administra
tion has taken Senates whimsical de
mands seriously in the past.
Some may wonder why apathy is so 
high among the students that a few Sen
ate seats cannot be filled. It only takes 25 
signatures from a students college to put 
him or her on a ballot or into a vacancy. 
Attaining 25 signatures is not difficult.
I have been a Student Senator, and I 
recognize the difficulties they face. Sure,
its fun to allocate thousands of dollars of 
everyone elses money. But a Senator 
also has to deal with whining from stu
dents, the administration, and most of 
all, other Senators. I had to sit on meet
ings lasting over three hours, listening to 
other Senators cry about howtheir friends 
arent treated well on campus, and lis
tening to students spout theories of con
spiracy on the part of the administration. 
If that isnt enough, Senators have to 
deal with the constant criticism they re
ceive from campus media.
Why should Student Senators be paid, 
and not other members of organizations?
The purpose of having a Student Sen
ate is to represent student concerns to 
the administration. The keyword is rep
resent. If the Senate does not represent 
students, then there is no purpose in 
having it. We may as well have the ad
ministration administer the Activities 
Fee and find student input themselves.

agreements, why is a trade agreement 
with a Third World nation causing such 
an uproar in this country?
The answers to this question are many, 
but one reason that this agreement has 
taken on such a large significance is that 
it may represent Bill Clintons last chance 
to show the American people that he truly 
is a New Democrat and not just another 
one of the old guard protectionist.
During the debate over his budget pro
posal, Clinton continued the policies of 
previous tax-and-spend Democrats by re
neging on his promise for a middle class 
tax cut, raising the gasoline tax, and rais
ing taxes on wealthy Americans. All this 
was done, he claimed, for deficit reduc
tion. However, he failed to cut current 
spending; all spending cuts occur in later 
years, yet it is the spending cuts that 
Americans are clamoring for. In addition, 
he failed to show he had a backbone, by 
constantly giving in to the wishes of ConPlease see NAFTA, page S

Abortion considered
Matt Ball
The world is far from a perfect place; doubtlessly, 
it would be closer to perfection if abortions were not 
needed. Insisting that abortions themselves are 
the problem, however, is a naive and unproductive 
attitude. Many forms of violence are prevalent in 
our society today such as rape, incest, child abuse, 
overpopulation, racism, and patriarchy. And that 
is only counting those against our fellow human
Outlawing abortion would do nothing to further 
the cause of justice; indeed, by forcing women 
either to have back-alley abortions, or to bring an 
unwanted child into the world, the cycle of abuse 
and suffering would be expanded.
Where can we start with the question of abortion 
itself? There is no black-and-white, although that 
is how the issue is framed and debated. To claim 
that a fertilized egg deserves the same consider
ation as the woman carrying it is as untenable a 
position as to contend that an eight-month-old 
fetus is a non-entity deserving no moral consider
ation. Being on one side of the birth canal as 
opposed to the other changes nothing for the indi
vidual fetus in any scientific sense either: the fetus 
is no more or less dependent than the newborn 
child. Viability is neither a scientific nor moral 
description because it varies with technology.
Choice is as big a buzzword as life. Although 
freedom has as one of its foundations the concept of 
choice, freedom cannot exist without choice being 
linked to responsibility. The use of the word choice 
to argue for abortion takes one concept of freedom 
and attaches it only to the end of a complicated 
sequence of events (i.e., whatever led to the preg
nancy). Promoting the rights of women simply by 
allowing abortion ignores all other aspects of the 
womans life and reduces the idea of equality to one 
medical act.
Unless we accept responsibility for our actions, 
the less powerful  women, minorities, children 
starving in third-world countries, the unborn, or 
otherspay the price for our freedom. Thus, the 
right to an abortion, while freeing women from 
the rule of men to an extent, is not a moral advance 
of humanity. It cannot be equated with slaverys 
abolition, suffrage, or civil rights.
Those who oppose abortion because they believe 
in the sanctity of all human life are rarely, if ever, 
able to offer a reasoned argument why all human 
life at all stages demands a guaranteed right to life 
at all costs. The arguments given are from the 
Bible in which there is no rational reason to believe 
or are based on general prejudice: I am a human, 
thus all human life must be sacred.
There is neither ethical nor scientific means of 
contending that a fully developed fetus is a non
entity, and there is no derivable, rational reason 
for contending that a fertilized egg  a single cell
 deserves consideration as a human being.
For those who dont accept a tradition of unques
tioned faith and who are struggling with decisions 
of great moral weight and ambiguity, the neces
sary question becomes one of finding the basis for 
granting respect to another being.
Intelligence is an undefinable, subjective con
cept at best. The idea that the fertilized egg has the 
potential falters because potential does not 
include retarded children or people who have suf
fered brain injuries or strokes.
When we ask what the characteristic is that all 
human beings share, the answer is that we all have 
interests of some nonmetaphorical type.
The most basic of these are the desire for plea
sure and the desire to avoid pain. Sentience  the 
ability to sense and act upon those sensationsis 
what sets beings apart from rocks (not living) and 
plants (living, but with no central nervous system 
that allows sentience).
Sentience is also what separates us from a fertil
ized egg. It is here that the issue of abortion finds 
its most reasonable framework: it is not a question 
of right to life nor right to choose, but rather a 
question of interests  a question of suffering. 
Abortion before the point of sentience should not be 
an issue. The womans interest are the only ones 
that need to be considered; there are no others. 
After the fetus reaches the point of sentience, 
however, more than the interests of the woman are 
at stake. To lessen all violence and suffering is the 
ultimate goal. Until people work specifically for 
this goal instead of trying to force their beliefs on 
others, nothing will improve.
To obtain any advance tomorrow, we must put 
aside our judgments and work with the world as it 
exists today; otherwise, we are simply perpetuat
ing and increasing our problems.

Cows contribute to economy

So by increasing consumer

also contribute in less direct

Increased beef exports? Or

Nope. It turns out that cow

This weeks wacky research 
award goes to researchers at the 
University of Maine who have 
developed a prototype system that 
mixes salad bar scraps with cow 
manure in a biogas-generating 
machine called, appropriately 
enough, a digester tank. This 
can produce enough electricity 
for a family home.
Across the country, people right 
now are saying to each other,
Harold, wouldnt a digester 
tank be an attractive furnish

could put it next to the plastic

itll match our rug?
That would be fine, except 
that theres one other by-product of cow manure we havent

Free trade needed

gressmen who desired certain 
perks in order for him to re
ceive their vote.
Now Clinton has a chance to 
show the American people that 
he believes strongly in some
thing, free trade, and this is a 
subject that he can use to dis
tance himself from the old 
Democratic party policy. Al
ready, Clinton is finding him
self in a strange position; the 
Democrats for the most part 
are against him, while the Re
publicans in Congress support 
him.
For Clinton to pass this trade 
agreement, he must convince 
Democrats that the free trade 
policies developed by Republi
cans are actually better for the 
country and, in doing so, he 
finally has the chance to show 
the American people that he 
believes in something not di
rectly out of the Democratic 
Party machine.
Because this agreement dif
fers from the normal trade policy 
expected of a Democratic Presi
dent, it must be asked why does 
Clinton support it?
Simply, as George Bush said 
throughout his 1992 campaign, 
NAFTA will be a great boon to 
the country.
Some people, like Ross Perot, 
oppose NAFTA because they be
lieve that it will siphon jobs from 
America into Mexico where the 
average wage is $13 lower than it 
is here. While it is true that some 
companies may move their op
erations south of the border, some 
predict a net gain of175,000 jobs 
by 1995.
Also, as a result of the trade 
agreement, over one million 
American jobs would be tied to 
trade with Mexico. And these jobs 
are not low-wage paying jobs ei
ther; instead, the worker whose 
job is tied to exports earns over 13 
percent more money than the av
erage American worker. Plus, the 
wages of high-skilled workers in 
this country are predicted to in
crease by almost $6,000 if the 
agreement is implemented. 
Thus, NAFTA would not cre
ate a vacuum of jobs in America
 it would create more jobs at 
higher wages.
In December 1992, after he 
had lost the election, George 
Bush signed the North Ameri
can Free Trade Agreement, not 
as a political move, but as a 
move that he felt would help 
America. Bill Clinton now has 
the opportunity to implement 
the vision of this great Ameri
can and in doing so, he could 
regain public support by show
ing that he believes in some
thing, and he could also help 
stimulate the American 
economy.

previous semesters because they had less time 
to prepare in the weeks beforehand.
I am sure that Lowry had good intentions 
when he made the decision to change the 
librarys hours, but he must try to see things 
from the students point of view. The new 
books that the library would be able to buy 
would be of no use to someone who cannot get 
to the library until late at night.
Also, the ability of students to use the li
brary as an alternative to unpleasant and 
distracting dorm studying should not be taken 
away.
Therefore, I urge all CMU students to not 
take this reduction of their study time and 
resources lying down.
There are many things that can be done. 
First of all, look for the many petitions that 
are circulating, and sign them. If you cant 
find one of them, go to the Skibo Info desk and 
request a petition from the student senate 
mailbox.
Get it filled with names and return it to the 
Info desk. If that requires too much effort, 
then simply send your student senators on 
email, or call the Senate office at 8-2115 and 
complain.
Finally, if you have no other option, contact 
the Dean of Student Affairs, Mike Murphy. 
Write him email, stop by and see him, or call 
him at 8-2075 and tell him how much this 
change is going to affect your performance at 
CMU.
For once, CMU students should show what 
they are really made of and let the adminis
tration know that they refuse to have such a 
valuable resource taken away.

tally unrepresentative of the students. Two 
years ago, Student Senate passed a piece of 
legislation by a nine to one margin. A referen
dum was held on the same issue, where a 
majority of the students rejected Senate s 
decision. Senate decided to declare the refer
endum non-binding and reaffirmed the origi
nal vote. This sort of behavior is very typical of 
Senate, proving that fair representation re
quires that there be competition in voting. If 
students have clear choices at election time, 
they can decide what sort of Senators they 
want representing them.
The two options that exist for providing 
competition are: 1) decreasing the number of 
seats, or 2) increasing the number of students 
running. The first option would require elimi
nating seats almost to the point of non-exist
ence. The second requires an increase in mo
tivation for the students. The best way to do 
this is monetary incentive. But not to fear, 
think what a motivated Senate could do. It 
might even be able to push the ever-rising 
tuition cost down, saving students a great deal 
of money in the long run.
Former Senators have argued that a non
competitive Student Senate is good, as it pro
vides all students with a chance to get in
volved in Senate. One of these same Senators 
attempted to get back on Student Senate when 
one of his pet organizations was not receiving 
the funding he desired. When any person can 
jump on Senate for a free vote on any issue he 
wants, its time for a change.
People may not like Student Senate, but 
representation requires competitiveness. 
Right now, payment by the Administration is 
the only option we have.

scrambled for a six yard gain. 
Once again F&M was faced with 
a third down situation, but CMU 
was called for an offside penalty. 
This penalty gave F&M a first 
and goal on the CMU 9 yard line.
On the next play Meekings com
pleted a nine-yard pass for a 
touchdown making the score 17- 
14 in favor of CMU. This was the
their 36 yard line. The Tartans 
used the clock well and Harding 
kicked a 25-yard field goal with 
:06 left in the first half.
Franklin & Marshall came out 
throwing in the second half, tak
ing advantage of the Tartan sec
ondary. F&M returned a Harding 
punt 34 yards and started on their 
own 49 yard line. The F&M drive 
seemed dead on third and two 
when Meekings missed a handoff. He evaded a few Tartan tacklers in the backfield and
closest F&M would get.
The Tartans took over on the 
F&M 39 yard line after a 38-yard 
kickoff return by Siket. The Tar
tans needed only five plays to 
score their third touchdown on a 
13-yard Filicko run.
F&M took over on their own 25 
yard line and moved the ball well 
until junior DB Steve Voytovich

proved to be the turning point of

with a lot of potential; its just a 
matter of playing together.
Dee completed four out of 13 
passes for 109 yards. He made up 
for his sparse passing numbers 
by rushing for 83 yards on 14 
carries. Grusky led the offense 
with 90 yards on 14 attempts. 
The impressive rushing numbers 
for Dee and Grusky show that the 
offensive line held their own 
against the F&M defense.
I was happy with the blocking; 
the line did a great job. This 
win sets the tone for the year, 
said Grusky.
Defensively, the Tartans al
lowed Franklin and Marshall 
265 total yards.
Senior ILB Chad Wilson led 
the defense with nine tackles 
and senior ILB Jeff Blue regis
tered eight tackles. The Tar
tans also registered three 
sacks, by senior DB Jerry 
Fuller, sophomore OLB E.J. 
Tsangaris, and senior DT Ben 
Burton.
The defense was most effec
tive against the F&M run, hold
ing the Diplomats to only 44 
net rushing yards. The de
fense also contained Meekings 
well, holding the F&M quar
terback to only 13 yards on six 
carries.
The offense and defense com
bined to give the Tartans their 
sixth straight victory, continu
ing their scoring streak to 196 
consecutive games.
Head coach Rich Lackner was 
pleased with the outcome.
"We go into every game with 
the attitude that we can win.
F&M never gave up, but the 
critical play was the blocked field 
goal, and the long touchdown pass 
to Siket was the turning point in 
the game.
We are constantly improving 
in every area. The kicking game 
needs improvement; we gave up 
too many long returns. The kick
ing game has a great outcome on

Dee rushed for 12 yards and a

yards on a rush.
On second and 12, Dee proved 
that the shoulder problems he 
had during training camp were 
not bothering him by firing a per
fect pass to Siket, which went for 
a 60-yard touchdown play.
F&M played a man to man 
coverage and challenged [Chris

made a good call, and Chris made 
a good pass down the middle, 
said Siket. '
The final score of the game, 
and the third for the Tartans in 
the fourth quarter, came as Jun

the Tartan offense. The Tartans 
scored on a three-yard rush by

adjust, said Defensive Coordi

said that the headset he uses to 
communicate with the coaches in 
the press box was out. He said 
that the lack of headphones made 
the game frustrating and more 
difficult for him to communicate 
with the players.
The Tartans scored first on a 
one-yard QB keeper, with 5:20 
left in the first quarter. F&M 
took over on their own 30 after 
the Harding kickoff. F&M went 
four plays and out, spurred by a 
seven-yard sack by sophomore 
OLB E.J. Tsangaris. After a 40- 
yard punt the Tartans took over 
on their 37 yard line. Three plays 
later, the Tartans punted and 
F&M took over on their own 10 
yard fine.
F&M marched down the field 
on a pair of passes. Meekings 
completed a 27-yard pass to se
nior SE Zac Kraft, and three plays 
later, Meekings completed a 33- 
yard touchdown pass again to 
Kraft.
On the ensuing kickoff, Filicko 
returned the ball 32 yards to give 
the Tartans excellent field posi
tion at the 50 yard line. On third 
down, Grusky fumbled and F&M 
recovered.
The Diplomats marched down 
the field on three passes and three 
rushes. The drive stalled on the 
Tartan four-yard line. F&M opted 
to try the field goal on fourth and 
one. The 22-yard attempt was 
blocked by junior DT Merle 
Atkinson. The Tartans took ad
vantage of the blocked field goal 
and went 80 yards in six plays to 
score their second touchdown on 
a three-yard run by Grusky.

Both the CMU mens and womens teams gave a 
great performance at last Saturdays cross-country meet against CalifomiaUniversity of Pennsyl
vania and Clarion University.
The womens team came in first with a score of 25 
points, while the mens team won with 24.
Coach Dario Donatelli wasnt sure how the meet 
was going to turn out, being the first of the season 
and the team having so many new runners. The 
team ran better than I had expected, he said. 
Sophomore Missy Baustert took first place with a 
time of 19.34. Missy is already ahead of where she 
was last year, said Donatelli.
Baustert was followed by freshman Rebecca

The Carnegie Mellon Tartans 
opened their 1993 football cam
paign with an impressive win over 
the Franklin & Marshall Diplo
mats, 38-14. The Tartans scored 
a touchdown on their first pos
session and never looked back. 
The game was close until the 
fourth quarter, when the Tar
tans scored three touchdowns.
The Tartans combined a pound
ing running attack and a few wellplaced passes to score. Senior QB 
Chris Dee, junior HB Jason 
Grusky, junior HB Jim Filicko 
and senior FB Brian Horton 
scored on the ground. Senior WR 
Jarrod Siket scored on a 60-yard 
pass from Dee, the longest play 
from scrimmage, and senior PK 
Fred Harding added a 25-yard 
field goal.

NHL starts sharpening skates, taping sticks for 93-94
The Puck Stops Here
By Allan Bourdius
Since crowning the Montreal 
Canadiens as Stanley Cup Champions 
in May, the National Hockey League 
has gone through some major changes, 
including expansion, realignment, and 
allegations of game fixing.
Two new teams have been chartered. 
The first was awarded to the Disney 
Corporation, and will play in Anaheim, 
California as the Mighty Ducks.
The second new franchise belongs to 
Blockbuster Video mogul and Florida 
Marlins owner Wayne Huizenga, and 
will play in Miami as the Florida Pan
thers.
The expansion draft was also different 
than previous ones. Existing teams could 
only protect nine forwards, five 
defensemen, and one goaltender from 
possible selection by the expansion clubs. 
Although this left many quality players 
open to selection, no real surprises re
sulted from the draft.
In general, it seems that the Mighty 
Ducks came out ahead by drafting vet
eran players, including exNew York 
Rangers goaltender John Vanbiesbrouck 
and ex-New Jersey Devils defenseman 
Alexei Kasatonov.
The Panthers draft choices were some
what questionable. The first three for
wards they selected (Tom Fitzgerald, 
Jesse Belanger, and Scott Levins) scored 
a combined total of 13 goals last season. 
The most significant additions to the 
Panther franchise are behind the bench. 
Ex-Ranger head coach Roger Neilson 
has been hired to lead the Panthers, 
while ex-Islander goaltender and 
goaltending coach Billy Smith will train 
the teams netminders.
One team moved during the summer 
as well. The Minnesota North Stars 
packed up their skates and headed south 
for Dallas, Texas. This season they will 
play as the Dallas Stars. However, there 
is a contest that fans may enter to decide 
a new name for the team beginning with 
the 1994-95 season.
The divisional and conference align
ments and the format of the Stanley Cup 
playoffs have been significantly changed; 
the old conference and division names 
are gone, making way for a more regionally-motivated league structure.
As before, there will be two confer
ences (Eastern and Western) and four 
divisions. The Atlantic (NY Rangers, 
NY Islanders, New Jersey, Philadelphia, 
Washington, Tampa Bay, and Florida) 
and Northeastern (Boston, Montreal, 
Pittsburgh, Buffalo, Quebec, Hartford, 
and Ottawa) will play in the Eastern 
conference.
The Western Conference contains the 
Central (Chicago, Toronto, Winnipeg, 
Dallas, St. Louis, and Detroit) and Pa
cific (Los Angeles, San Jose, Anaheim, 
Edmonton, Calgary, and Vancouver) 
divisions.
From now on, instead of the top four 
teams in each division making the first 
round of the playoffs, the top eight teams 
in each conference will be entered in the 
post-season tournament.
Recently, the Ottawa Senators were 
under investigation by the National 
Hockey League because of allegations of 
game-fixing. Allegedly, the Senators de
liberately threw the final game of the 
season to insure that they would get the 
first pick in the league entry draft. The 
Senators pick, 18-year-old center 
Alexandre Daigle, is said to be the best 
French-Canadian player since the Pen
guins Mario Lemieux. The Senators 
were cleared of any wrongdoing on Fri
day.
After the Los Angeles Kings lost the 
Stanley Cup finals to Montreal it was 
rumored that all-time scoring leader 
Wayne Gretzky was considering retire
ment. The Great One laid those rumors
to rest, announcing his intended return 
for at least the 1993-94 season. If he is 
unhampered by the injuries that have 
plagued him in recent years, it is likely 
that he will pass Gordie Howes career' 
rtiark of 801 goals this season. Gretzky 
currently holds or shares 52 individual 
NHL records.
On a final note, some ominous news 
for Penguins fans: Mario Lemieux, last 
years leading scorer and the Hart Tro
phy winner as most valuable player, had 
yet another operation on his ailing back 
during the summer at Shadyside Hospi
tal. Lemieux will miss all of training 
camp and perhaps the first few weeks of 
the season as well. His recurring back 
problems and history of Hodgkins Dis
ease call his longevity as a top player 
seriously into question.
Training camps open in about two 
weeks. Next week: an in-depth look at 
the Atlantic Division.

The Gym Rat

In my English class, Reading the Built Landscape, the discussion 
turned to baseball parks and stadiums.
A number of reasons were offered to explain why new stadiums 
have been, and continue to be constructed.
I feel economics is a major factor in the decision-making process. 
The teams that play in these parks hope for increased attendance 
and profits, and the new park is usually tied in with a renewal project 
of a downtown neighborhood.
Some new stadiums and parks like Comiskey Park in Chicago and 
Skydome in Toronto replace the old, decrepit Comiskey and the non
baseball Exhibition Stadium.
Others, like Oriole Park at Camden Yards in Baltimore and the 
new stadiums in Cleveland and Texas are not being built to replace 
old stadiums that can no longer be used, but solely in order to make 
more money and give a civic-minded appearance. To some extent 
they might be, but I doubt it is their main objective.
The topic of baseball stadiums and parks is a particular favorite of 
mine. To date, Ive been to Yankee Stadium and Shea Stadium in 
New York, Skydome in Toronto, and of course Three Rivers Stadium, 
where Ive witnessed about 45 games in the last four seasons. The 
only problem with attending Pirates games is the stadium.
I dislike this antiseptic, symmetrical, artificial hunk of poured 
concrete. The reason I still attended so many games was the teams 
huge success; their performance held my attention more than my 
dislike for the stadium had.
Now that the Pirates are a second-rate team, I cant subject myself 
to the architecture of the stadium. My two-game attendance this 
season reflects that.
While the stadium is relatively new and is adequate for baseball, 
I would love nothing more than a new baseball stadium designed like
The only problem with attending 
Pirates games is the stadium. I dis

artifical hunk of poured concrete.
the old Forbes Field to be built. Leave Three Rivers Stadium to the 
Steelers. I know I am not the first one to come up with the idea, even 
Pittsburgh mayor Sophie Masloff declared the idea a legitimate 
; endeavor.
The response was mostly negative, due in large part to the high 
cost of construction and economic track record of the team.
If a group of investors took the risk, and a stadium was built  
perhaps in the Strip or Hill Districtsit would be a great economic 
! and architectural addition to the city.
The increase in attendance, particularly from tourism, would help 
the team and investors turn a profit, as well as revitalize the area, 
both economically and aesthetically.
From the fans point of view, attending a Pirates game would be 
, more enjoyable and aesthetically satisfying, and less emphasis 
; would be placed on the performance of the team.
Building a new stadium with the fans enjoyment deemed the 
; motivating factor is admirable and neccesary. Do that, and the fans 
will gladly make it an economic success for the investors and team 
owners.
Just imagine: the smell of real green grass; a double off the wall 
that turns into a triple when it hits that peculiar angle in left center; 
lots of dirt in the infield that takes you right back to Little League.
How long would it take you to forget those huge bounces the ball 
; takes on artifical turf? Or the grimace of pain on the faces of 
] outfielders suffering from the raspberry rugbums they receive after 
| diving for a fly ball? Probably one game at this new park.
Finally, why not let the Architecture students at Carnegie Mellon 
j design the new park? It would be a great experience for the students 
! and would help keep the costs down during the design process.

Both teams kick off soccer season
By L.W. KOCHANSKYJ
Tartan Sports Editor
Julie Shackford, head coach 
of the womens soccer team, en
ters herthird season withmuch 
optimism and excitement. The 
program is entering its third 
season of competition, and its 
secondintheUAA. Despite last 
seasons 6101 record, includ
ing six losses against UAA op
ponents, Shackford feels the 
team .could have some success 
this season.
This year we have a real 
young team10 freshmen and 
one transfer student. Its hard 
to predict how well do this sea
son. Half of our staring lineup 
are freshmen, and they dont 
have any game experience yet.
The team, obviously in the 
throes of a youth movement, 
will still depend on some key 
upperclassmen. Returning is 
senior sweepejr Anh Nguyen, a 
UAA second-team selection.
Other vital players are se
nior co-captains and forwards 
Rachel Bourn and Julie Paul. 
Paul was the leading scorer 
during the past two season, but 
is currently battling stress frac
tures in her shins. Midfielder 
Diantha Korzun and backup 
goalie Trish Henrich round out 
the seniors.
Returning juniors are Chris
tina Isaly and Kathi Watson, 
both defenders. Junior Chandra 
Theesfeld is new to the team 
this year.
The rest of the squad is com
prised of five sophomores and 
ten freshmen, from whom 
Shackford plans to get most of 
her lineup.
We have five freshmen and 
two sophomores starting. I dont 
know if they are ready to step 
up. Ill expect more of them 
because they are stronger playersthan in past years. We have 
more skill and speed this year, 
said Shackford.
Shackford is pleased because 
she feels the team will be able 
to have better practices, play at 
a higher level, and do things 
tactically that they couldnt do 
in the past. In spite of her 
enthusiam, I wonderedhow she
feltcoachingsomanyyoung, rela
tively inexperienced college ath
letes on her soccer team.
I think its great, having these 
kids for four years. It will help 
build our program. I have no 
qualms about starting freshmen 
at all, said Shackford. I feel 
there is no real weak area on the 
field this year. It will all depend 
on the freshmen stepping up. I 
will put them in game situations

right off the bat.
Some of the key sophomores 
look to be midfielder Maria 
Casella and stopper Bridget 
Caster. The freshmen are led by 
the Tartans top recruit, goalie 
Jill Weber. Weber is a highly re
cruited player out of Philadel
phia. Other freshmen who will be 
starting are forward Courtney 
Spence; midfielders Mae Hogan, 
Alyssa Newman and Jill 
Sincaglia; and defender Marla 
Spontak.
For a team with a relatively 
new college program, I was curi
ous about which teams Shackford 
anticipated playing.
Allegheny College, because 
weve lost to them both years. 
The players and coaches look for
ward to playingthem. In the UAA, 
the team is looking forward to 
playing Washington University 
of St. Louis and Emory Univer
sity. Both games were so close 
last year. [Both 10 defeats, one 
in overtime], said Shackford. The 
team plays Allegheny at home

The Carnegie Mellon mens soc
cer team opens its 1993 season 
Wednesday at Washington & 
Jefferson College with ate am that 
resembles last seasons 12-41 
squad, which finished fifth in the 
Pennsylvania Region, narrowly 
missing an NCAA playoff berth.
I think our ultimate goal is to 
make the NCAA tournament, 
said senior midfielder Min Chong. 
To do so, the team must finish in 
the top four in the region or win 
the UAA crown for an automatic 
berth.
Veteran head coach Nick 
Gaudioso, last years UAA coach 
of the year, opens his 13th year 
with a team that resembles his 
squads of years past: long on tal
ent, short on depth.
We have a good team, just not 
much depth, Gaudioso said. I 
still think we can play. We just 
have to last the whole season 
without getting hurt. Itll be an 
interesting season if we stay 
healthy.
I think we can be very com
petitive, Chong said. If we are 
not hurt, healthy, we can do 
things with this game plan. We 
will be very competitive, and I 
dont think [earning the NCAA 
berth] is farfetched.
Of the teams 11 starters, nine 
are letter winners from last sea
son, while two are freshman re
cruits.
Gaudioso, is assisted by Brad 
Shapiro, who replaced veteran 
assistant Dan Moss. They will 
use a 1-5-3 formation, with jun
ior Alex Amezquita, the teams 
leading scorer last year with eight 
goals and 10 assists, the lone true 
forward.
Hes just going to keep getting 
better and better, Gaudioso said 
of Amezquita. Its hard to score 
in this league, but hell get his 
share. Hes going to be our target 
player, and he can keep people on 
top of him [to free up others].
The other key field player will 
be veteran John Stivoric, a gradu
ate student in his final year of 
eligibility. Stivoric, the teams 
stopper last season, will move to 
sweeper, where he has the unen
viable task of replacing five
time All-UAA selection Alan 
Horn, last years league player 
of the year. Horn was one of 
three starters who graduated, 
along with forward Terence 
Sibiya, one of the teams top 
scorers, and four-year defen
sive starter J.R. Yakubisin.
Stivoric, a big, strong player 
who has had injury problems in 
the past, is the man to replace
courtesy of CMU Athletic Dept.Men's coach Nick Gaudioso
Horn, Gaudioso said.
John is a different kind of 
player from Alan. Hes a big 
rock type of player, where Alan 
was very athletic, he said. Hes 
a great leadership-type person, 
too. When you beat everybody 
[else on the team] and then see 
John standing there, its very 
hard to deal with.
Joining Stivoric on defense 
will be junior Jeff McJunkin, a 
three-year starter, along with 
sophomore Alan Levin, who 
played a big role as a starter 
and top reserve last season, and 
 freshman Suraj Naik.
The other freshman starter 
will be midfielder Tom Layton, 
who along with senior Mike 
Brazinski  an All-UAA selec
tion and the teams secondleading scorer last yearwill play 
a rover midfield.
Tom Layton and Suraj are 
goingto be greatlittle players, 
Gaudioso said. They were both 
All-State, Tom in Florida, Suraj 
in New Jersey.

Dallas has a four million dollar Cowboy
Quarterback Sneak
by John Weber
Free agency has arrived in the NFL like Hurri
cane Emily in North Carolina. Its the first year of 
free agency and already the top running back in the 
NFL is a holdout.
Even though Emmitt Smith is not a free agent, 
free agency is the reason he is holding out. Smith 
has seen players like Reggie White and Steve 
Young sign big contracts, and now he feels that it 
is his turn. Can you blame him? Last year, Smith 
gained 1,713 rushing yards during the season and 
won a Super Bowl ring in late January. But is he 
worth four million dollars a year? The Dallas
Cowboys obviously do not think so. They have 
continuously denied rumors that they have offered 
him anything over $2.5 million a year.
For those of you who like Americas Team, 
there is no reason to worry; Emmitt Smith will be 
back by the fourth or fifth week. The Cowboys need 
Emmitt if they want to win, and Emmitt needs the 
Cowboys if he wants to play football.
However, without Emmitt Smith, the Cowboys 
will have a difficult time getting off to a good start 
in 1993. Leaving the running game in the hands 
(feet?) of rookie Derrick Lassie and inexperienced 
Michael Beasley is not what Jerry Jones and Jimmy 
Johnson had in mind when they planned this 
seasons running game.
This year the NFC East does not look nearly as 
strong as it did last year. Because of this, the 
Cowboys should have no problem repeating as 
division winners. Without Emmitt Smith in the 
lineup, the Cowboys offense will not be as potent 
as last year.
Without Dave Wannstedt as defensive coordina
tor, the defense may not be as tough as last year.

However, the defensive personnel has improved, 
adding depth and experience. This young Cowboy 
team is still very talented and will still be the team 
to beat in the NFC Eastern Division.
The Washington Redskins will be in second place 
in the NFC East. Without Gaiy Clark and Joe 
Gibbs, the Redskins are in for a long season. New 
coach Richie Petitbon is doing a good job of holding 
the team together, but none of the problems of 1992 
have been solved. Mark Rypien is still inconsis
tent, and the team is not getting any younger. You 
can expect about the same as last year from the 
Redskins. They will occasionally make waves in 
the NFC East, but they wont win the big games.
The Phoenix Cardinals are finally a force to 
reckon with. They have quarterbacks like Steve 
Beuerleih and Chris Chandler with targets like 
Gary Clark and Ricky Proehl. With Garrison Hearst 
in the backfield, the Cardinals offense should be 
able to put some points on the board. On defense, 
the Cardinals strength is still in the secondary 
despite the loss of Tim McDonald to free agency. 
The Cardinals will make things interesting in the 
East.
The Philadelphia Eagles and New York Giants 
will not do much at all in 1993. Philadelphia was 
decimated by free agency. Randall Cunningham 
and Herschel Walker will not be enough for even a 
third place finish. Their defense is now without 
Reggie White, who went to the Packers. The New 
York Giants will be the runts of the NFC East. Dan 
Reeves is a good coach, but he is not a miracle 
worker.
Without Jeff Hostetler, who went to the Los 
Angeles Raiders, the Giants must rely on Phil 
Simms, Kent Graham or Dave Brown to get a 
couple of wins. Lacking a quality receiving corps, 
the Giants will have to rely on their average run
ning game. The defense has Lawrence Taylor back, 
but thats about it.
The 1993 NFC Central is beginning to look like 
Wrestlemania. All five teams, except perhaps the 
Tampa Bay Buccanneers, are up and coming.
The Minnesota Vikings recently traded for Barry 
Word, and they have already acquired quarterback 
Jim McMahon. The Missile, Qadry Ismail, adds 
additional exitement to an offense that was consid
ered dull in 1992. The defense still features line
man Chris Doleman and linebacker Jack Del Rio. 
Expect the Vikings to win the division again.
While the Green Bay Packers still have some 
weaknesses, the addition of Reggie White on de
fense will definitely strengthen the line. Quarter
back Brett Farve and wide reciever Sterling Sharpe 
were both sharp in-92, and can be expected to be 
the same this year.
However, losing Vince Workman, their work
horse in the backfield, wont help the Packers. 
Expect Green Bay to make the playoffs, but not
much more.
The Chicago Bears and Detroit Lions could be 
battling for the last NFC playoff spot in December.
Dave Wannstedt will bring back the intensity to 
Chicago that Mike Ditka did not posess these last 
few years.
The Bears still have Harbaugh and have added 
Ironhead Heyward from the New Orleans Saints, 
but their defense is in the rebuilding process.
The Lions will be better this year. Andre Ware 
and Rodney Peete will be handing off to Barry 
Sanders, who is at the peak of his career. The Lions 
will have the luxury of ten dome games which 
should help their run-and-shoot offense. However, 
the Lions defense is the question mark this year, 
even with free agent Pat Swilling. So dont expect 
them to go far.
Yes, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers are still in the 
NFL, and yes they will occupy last place in the NFC 
Central in 1993. The Bucs need a quarterback and 
since big free agent addition Hardy Nickerson 
plays middle linebacker, the Buccaneers are out of 
luck. Clean the cellar, the Buccaneers will be alone 
in last place this year.
In the West, it will be business as usual for the 
San Francisco 49ers. Steve Young, Jerry Rice, 
Ricky Watters, Tom Rathman, and John Taylor 
together make up one of the best offenses in his
tory. However, it takes defense to win the Super 
Bowl.
Newcomer Tim McDonald will help the second
ary, but defense is still the 49ers weakness. To get 
past the Vikings and the Cowboys, San Francisco 
will need a defense they can depend on.
New Orleans will be back in second this year. 
Running back Brad Muster will help the offense, 
but without Hebert, the New Orleans offense is no 
better than last year. The Saints defense will still 
be okay without Pat Swilling, but it wont be any 
better than last year. The Saints are in a rut: 
theyre better than average, but not quite as good 
as the big boys in the NFC.
The Atlanta Falcons and Los Augeles Rams will 
share third place again. The Falcons have a good 
offense with Andre Rison and Chris Miller, and a 
good defense with Deion Sanders at comerback, 
but they have no support players.
Head coach Chuck Knox and the Rams, on the 
other hand, could use some impact players like 
Rison and Sanders.
Quarterback Jim Everett has good receivers like 
Flipper Anderson and Henry Ellard, but they cant 
seem to get it together. Cleveland Gary is a solid 
running back, but may be on the trading block.
The defense has a few good players like lineman 
Sean Gilbert and comerback Todd Lyght, but not 
enough to get back into the playoff race.
John Weber is a junior civil engineering major.
September is when careers are born or killed Kickers setWOMEN, from natta 9
Out of Left Field
by Eric Strauss
The first week of September is 
a time of change. For baseball 
players, September 1 meant ros
ter expansion, and a chance to 
debut or return to the major
For football players, the period 
between August 30-September 2 
meant the final pre-season roster 
cut, and a chance to become part 
of a team, or part of the unem
ployment line.
For baseball players like Manny 
Ramirez, the top hitting prospect
in the Cleveland Indians organi
zation, September means a 
chance to face major league pitch
ing for the first time. He hit his 
first major league home run this 
weekend.
For football players like Keith 
McCants, the fourth overall pick 
in the 1990 draft, September 
meant an agonizing pre-season. 
He was released by the Tampa 
Bay Buccaneers, and the New 
England Patriots, only to land 
with the Houston Oilers.
While some baseball prospects, 
like Oakland Athletics pitcher 
Todd Van Poppel and Atlanta 
catcher Javier Lopez, have had 
extended tryouts this season, 
September is truly the season of 
youth.
Baseball is showcasing its 
names of the future right now, 
names like Colorado Rockies first 
baseman Jay Gainer, a minorleague slugger lost in the shadow 
of Andres Galarragas pursuit of 
the batting title; or Montreal 
Expos outfielder Rondell White, 
another minor-league star get
ting a taste of the big time.
September means a second 
chance for some former major 
leaguers, like New York Mets 
pitcher Anthony Young, he of the 
1-15 record and record-setting 
losing streak; or another New 
Yorker, veteran Yankee slugger 
Kevin Maas, the king of lefthanded power and left-handed 
strikeouts.
On the other hand, the National 
Football League has little mercy 
and fewer second chances.
Exhibit one: Former Cincinnati 
Bengals safety David Fulcher, the 
hard-hitting former Pro Bowl 
performer, who was first waived 
in favor of a younger, cheaper 
roolde, Lance Gunn, then signed 
bytheLosAngelesRaiders, where 
he was dumped as a linebacker in 
favor of youngster Mike Jones.
Exhibit two: Former Georgia 
Tech star safety Ken Swilling, 
once considered the top prospect 
in the 1992 draft. He got fat, was 
moved to linebacker, was picked 
in the seventh round in the 92 
draft, and has been waived three 
times in two years, including 
twice this season.

Exhibit three: A general list of 
NFL kickers, always in transi
tion as teams look for that special 
someone who wont be the Scott 
wide right Norwood of the 21st 
century. For instance, new Den
ver head coach Wade Phillips kept 
rookie Jason Elam over last years 
duo of David field goals 
Treadwell and Brad kickoffs 
Daluiso. Former Denver head 
coach Dan Reeves, now with the 
New York Giants, signed his dy. namic duo to replace Matt Bahr.
The list goes on and on, in both 
sports. Baseballs young studs 
make their debut as their team 
falls out of the pennant race. Thenveteran, role-player counterparts 
get a second, or in the case of 
veteran Boston Red Sox 
utilityman Steve Lyons, a fifth, 
chance to help their team out as it 
contends forthe crown. Baseballs 
September is the close of its regu
lar season, with pennant fever in 
the air, and the thrill of seeing 
the stars of the future.
Meanwhile, football, a sport 
with no mercy for the weak or the 
aging  or today, like baseball,
the overpricedpares its roster 
down as its season just begins. 
Young players, like New England 
Patriot Drew Bledsoe and Seattle 
Seahawk Rick Mirer, quarter
backs picked 12 in this years 
draft, fight to make an impact, 
while veterans like Jay 
Schroeder, the ex-Raider starter 
 who made the Bengals as a 
backup  and Ken OBrien, the 
ex-New York Jet starter  who 
didnt make the Green Bay Pack
ers as a backup  struggle to 
prolong their careers.
September is indeed a time of 
transition. In September, the 
NFL returns for its 1993 season, 
when every team has a chance at 
the Super Bowl, and on any given 
Sunday, any given team can win.
In September, major league 
baseball charges down the 
stretch, when the contenders have 
names  the Blue Jays, Yan
kees, White Sox, Phillies, etc.  
and the balance of power has been 
established.
Eric Strauss is a sophomore 
creative writing major.

to take on the other two oppo
nents.
The team has also added 
two new assistant coaches to 
the staff. Joining David Pot
ter in his second year is 
Michael Yonas and Brooke 
Lang.
In the UAA preseason poll, 
which doesnt seem to share 
Shackfords optimism, the 
Tartans are picked to finish 
last. That could be the best 
thing for the team. A 
darkhorse usually has the 
advantage against opponents 
who dont take them seriously. 
I wouldnt be surprised if the 
team wins a substantial num
ber of games, and finishes 
somewhere in the middle of 
the UAA this year.
The Yellowjackets from the 
University of Rochester are 
selected as the favorite to win 
the UAA this year.
A safe prediction since they 
have won all six UAA champi
onships. Look for the Tartans 
to change that in the coming 
lears^.

Womens tennis smashes Seton Hill, Waynesburg
By ERIC STRAUSS

The Carnegie Mellon womens 
tennis team jumped out to a fast 
start in 1993, posting a 8-1 win 
over Waynesburg College and a 
9-0 whitewashing of Seton Hill 
College sandwiched around a 7- 
2 loss to Division II power 
Frostburg State.

pleased with our performance. In 
three matches, eight players have 
played, and thats a good sign.

defeated Mary Nee in the num
ber one singles match, 61, 61; 
junior Stephanie Kukura defeated Nina Mordwinkin, 6-0,6-

Rotunno defeated Cheryl Arriola,

match, 6-1, 7-5; and sophomore 
Miriam Huang won 6-1,6-0, over 
Tara Harford in the sixth singles 
match.
In the doubles matches, Weber 
and Rotunno defeated Mord
winkin and Arriola, 6-0, 6-0; 
Kukura and Amin defeated Nee 
and Tsuda, 6-3,6-0; and Lee and 
Huang won the third doubles 
matchup, 6-0,6-3 (names of their 
opponents were unavailable).
Weve gotten off to a good start, 
but we do have tough opponents 
coming up, Moss said. The teams
next match will be against Grove 
City College on Thursday, then 
the team travels to Division II 
opponent California of Pennsyl
vania on Saturday. A big match 
will be September 19 against UAA 
foe Rochester, Moss said.
In the first match, against 
Waynesburg at Frostburg on Sat
urday, Weber, junior Kinga 
Czerska, Rotunno, junior Cherie 
Lin, and Amin picked up singles 
wins, while the doubles teams of 
Weber and Czerska; Rotunno and 
Kukura; and Huang and Lee were 
all victorious.
Against Frostburg State later 
on Saturday, Rotunno was the 
only singles winner, and the team 
of Rotunno and Kukura picked 
up the lone doubles win.
One benefit that has already 
made its presence felt this season 
is the new CMU tennis courts.
Its a lot better to be able to 
play at home, Rotunno said. The 
new courts really help our play, 
and its really nice to play on 
them.
The team spent all of last sea
son on the road while the courts 
were being renovated.
Two highlights coming up in 
the future are the Catholic Uni
versity Tournament, which closes 
the season on October 9-10, and 
the Rolex Northeast Regional 
College Tournament Champion
ships from September 24-26.
Weber andRotunno will be com
peting at the Rolex tournament 
individually in singles, and to
gether as a doubles team.
This is the first time CMU has 
competed in the Rolex tourna
ment. Grand opening of the ten
nis courts will be on September 9

CROSS-COUNTRY, from page 7
a time of 27.21. Mens coach Gary ! 
Meckley was pleased with the teams : 
performance, but was somewhat cau
tious. The team could have run a little ; 
better tactically early in the race.
Coach Meckley will have the team 
working on distance more in practices, 
because of its relative inexperience in 
running college length races.
The visiting team actually had the 
home course advantage, said Meckley, 
since more California State runners than 
Tartans had run the course before.
Its hard to know if the team is run
ning at its full potential since, for many, 
it was their first time out, said Meckley. 
He is confident, however, that his rather 
green team will toughen up and give a 
strong performance this season.
Soccer starts up season this week
SOCCER, from page 9
are junior Vince Russell, a two-year starter and the 
teams leading assist man with 11, and junior Pat 
Lucignani, another two-year starter.
The goalkeeper will be another All-UAA selec
tion, senior Dave Shapiro, Brads brother, who 
posted 10 shutouts and a 0.54 goals-against-average, both marks tying school records.
The teams depth will be provided by veteran 
backup goalie Dan Warren, another senior, who 
posted an 0.50 goals-against-average, and played 
superbly late in the season after Dave Shapiro was 
hurt.
In the field, veteran junior Mark Hale will be the 
teams 12th man, Gaudioso said, and freshman 
Nick Moons and first-year player Chuck Kuba, a 
junior, will be the other main field players until 
senior Basal Ramzy recovers from a minor injury.
Other experienced players include junior 
midfielder Han Ming Ong, and sophomore goalclassified
keeper John Moran.
Every one of those players on the field is either 
All-State or State Select, Gaudioso said. We play 
a different brand of soccer here. Its a really inter
changing sort of system. We just let the kids play 
soccer. Were at a good stage now.
I think the upperclassmen are doing a good job 
this year with their focus, Chong said. Were 
coming together well. Dan Warren organized a 
pre-season, working before the season. He con
tacted eveiy one [of the upperclassmen], and that 
really helped.
Although the team wonits two pre-season games, 
including a 10 win over Division I Robert Morris, 
Gaudioso said nothing is assured in the perenni
ally strong UAA.
T see the league being the strongest [in the 
country], he said. Every team is strong, and they 
are all very oldbig and physical. This [season] is 
going to be interesting.

Volume 88, Issue 2The Tartan, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh. Pennsylvania7 September 1993
Graduate writes book
By LAUREN HEINZ
Tartan Features Editor
As if being a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon doesnt keep 
one busy enough, Mark Kantrowitz, a PhD student in Computer 
Science, has co-authored a book with Joann P. Gennnaro, Presi
dent of the Center for Excellence in Education, entitled: The 
Prentice Hall Guide to Scholarships and Fellowships for Math 
and Science Students.
The book, Kantrowitz states, is of interest to all under
graduate and graduate students, but especially to seniors who 
are applying to graduate schools. Its a lot more accurate than 
other books of this sort.
The Guide is the only resource to focus on the more than 250 
scholarships and fellowships available to math and science 
students at the high school, undergraduate, and graduate levels. 
The book will teach its readers how to choose an undergraduate 
school that best meets their needsevaluating everything from 
courses of study and instructors to social atmosphere and extra
curricular activities. It also provides the latest information on 
over 80 contests and competitions, internships, summer employ
ment offerings, and opportunities to study abroad.
Also included are financial aid programs that span the range 
of careers open to students in science, math, and engineering - 
from biotechnology and computer science to meteorology and 
physics. The Guide works to uncover all possible sources of 
financial aid, assess career goals, obtain the most useful letters 
of recommendation from teachers, and get nominated for schol
arships and fellowships. The book also demonstrates how to 
estimate total college expenses and the amount of money a 
student and parents will have to come up with each year. A 
detailed worksheet, comprehensive formula, and financial plan
ning tips help eliminate needless aggravation and disappoint
ment.
Copies of The Guide are available in the E&S and Hunt 
Libraries, the CMU Career Center, and Bookstore.

Fifth Year program provides opportunity Professor publishes Eastwood analysis
Students work as assault counselors
By BETHANY SUTTON
Tartan Junior Staff
The Sexual Assault Advisors 
program was instituted at 
Carnegie Mellon University three 
years ago at the request of a few 
students who approached 
Michael Murphy, Dean of Stu
dent Affairs, in search of more 
avenues for people who had been 
raped or sexually assaulted, ac
cording to Katie Stannard, 
assistant to the dean of Stu
dent Affairs.
Currently consisting of 
seven students, five faculty, 
and 13 staff, the group 
works to ensure that vic
tims of these crimes are able 
to get in touch with the 
resources and services that 
they would like and to coun
sel them in relation to emo
tional, physical, safety, aca
demic, and legal or judicial 
concerns, says Stannard.
Bning an Advisor can be a 
tough role, says Stannard. I 
dont know that there is any typi
cal case of sexual assault.
This is true indeed; there are 
many degrees of assault and 
many circumstances involved; 
additionly, many people have 
mixed ideas about what consti
tutes sexual assault and rape.
New Advisors, primarily un
dergraduate students, are se
lected each spring after complet
ing a written application, and 
undergo an extensive series of. 
training sessions geared toward 
preparing them to counsel dis
tressed victims. The Advisors 
participate in two or three hourlong seminars each week for ap
proximately a month, on such 
topics as confidentiality, peer sup
port, health and medical con
cerns, legal concerns, safety con
cerns, sexual harassment, and 
practice counseling.
The number of students who 
may participate as Advisors is 
limited only by the ability to 
provide training, says Stannard. 
She also asserts that the number 
of students interested in partak
ing in the program is often over
whelming; since the beginning of 
the fall term, for example, at least 
five people have contacted her 
about becoming involved. For 
me, it is exciting to see members 
of the community [on campus] 
respond and become interested 
in this very important issue. 
The primary concern of the pro
gram is strict confidentiality. The 
Advisors role is to supply the 
victim with emotional support
and information concerning their 
options  not to force the victim 
into prosecuting. Ultimately, any 
course of action taken is depen
dent on the victim; Its all based 
upon the wishes of the survivor, 
says Stannard.
For this reason, it is hard to 
judge the number of people who 
have actually confided in an Ad
visor. Although Advisors will
periodically be asked to approxi
mate the number of people who 
have solicited their .help, there 
are no written records or tabs 
kept on those who come forward 
to talk to an Advisor; The statis
tics that are gathered for the of
fice include only statistics where 
a police report is made, says 
Stannard.
If necessary, the Advisor will 
suggest the victim contact off cam
pus agencies for long-term 
psychological care and sup
port, such as the Center for 
Victims ofViolent Crime and 
Pittsburgh Action Against 
Rape. Extensive medical at
tention is also provided 
through local hospitals, in 
addition to services avail
able at the University 
Health Center.
Sexual Assault Advisors 
can be contacted 24 hours a 
day. Victims can call an Advisor 
directly through the numbers in 
the sexual assault brochure. These 
pamphlets are available at both 
the Housing and Health offices, 
or through the Counseling Center 
located on the ground floor of 
Morewood Garden's E Tower, x8- 
2922.
Campus Police, x8-2323, may 
also be contacted.
For me, it is exciting to see members of 
the community [on campus] respond and 
become interested in this very important 
issue.

courses youve always wanted to take but could not 
because of scheduling conflicts and graduation re
quirements. Imagine postponing the leap into the rat 
race of the real world for a year while studying some
thing you want to study. Now open your eyes and read 
about a program that can open that world up for you.
Founded in 1991 by President Robert Mehrabian at 
the request of student body leaders, the Fifth Year 
Scholar Program allows a handful of students to re
main at CMU an extra year after graduation to study 
a field that they are interested in but have never been 
able to explore.
Students can apply in the spring of their penultimate 
year. A written application, complete with essays and 
.reference requests, is reviewed by a committee consist
ing of the program coordinator, associate deans of the 
colleges, current Fifth Year Scholars, and members of 
the Student Affairs staff. Interviews are then con
ducted, and final selections made, with notification of 
the recipients in April.
- Those who are selected must choose their classes andI
 get department head'approval. They must also have in 
mind an outline of what they will give back to the 
University community during the year.
Rebecca Henn was notified that she had made the 
cut, making her eligible for her sixth year of study. An 
architecture major as an undergraduate, she has re
turned and is taking a slate of courses aimed at prepar
ing her for work in Central America, where she intends 
to use her architectural knowledge to help develop 
Third World countries. Though her commitments are 
many and time is currently a premium, she is confident 
in her decision.
Im very glad that I took this year, because Im 
itching to work now. I have a drive to get into the real 
.world, she said. I think its a very valuable program.
This years group of scholars has taken it upon itself 
to seek a solution to what it sees as a troubling di
lemma. With the pending destruction of Skibo, the 
popular restaurant and hangout Scotland Yard will be 
closed, for at least a few years.
The scholars all enjoyed its function during their 
time here and decided that it would be wrong for an 
entire class of students to miss its effects, and so they 
are looking for ways to set up an interim Scotland 
Yard. This sort of group effort and concern for campus 
harmony is a requirement for each class of scholars.
. Now in its third year, the programs supporters 
believe it will become an integral part of the CMU 
; academic experience, pointing out that not only will 
the competition for the opportunity produce better 
students, but the presence of the scholars on campus 
will enrich the education of the undergraduate com
munity.
By simply trying the Fifth Year Scholars program,
 the University has shown its commitment to enriching 
the education of its students in. new ways.

Clint Eastwoods popularity was revived when the Academy gave him a slew of awards for his film 
Unforgiven. Even after this highly acclaimed production, its a popular belief that Eastwood goes
around twirling a gun, saying, Go ahead, make my 
day.
Paul Smith, coordinator of literary and cultural 
studies at CMU, has something to say about this 
stereotype that Eastwood has been unable to shake. 
He recently wrote thebookClintEastwood:a Cultural 
Production, which explores Eastwoods role in Ameri
can cultural life, taking a step beyond Eastwoods 
individual character roles.
Smith chose to write about Eastwood because the 
actor has consistently been an icon of masculinity 
since first appearing in the spaghetti westerns of the 
1960s.
Eastwood also possesses more power than the aver
age actor because he directly controls his work through 
his own production company. This sort of control not 
only makes Eastwood unique, but also a bit stand-off
ish; Smith could not get an interview or recognition of 
any sort from Eastwood.
Without an interview, Smith could only explore the 
medias representations of Eastwoods personal rela
tionships. So Smith concentrated on the events hap
pening around the films and focused on the reactions 
to them.
Movies have very broad social and cultural and 
political connections, Smith says, even though Holly
wood productions are commonly used and seen for 
entertainment purposes only. The media did actually 
address the underlying issues of fascism when Dirty 
Harry first appeared on the big screen. Smith ex
pands on this recognized example, and explores the 
implications of Eastwoods other films to paint a 
picture of particular moments of American cultural 
life.
Smiths intended audience includes those who are 
familiar with Eastwood, but the book is written for 
anyone interested in exploring cultural themes as they 
are subtly revealed through Eastwood movies and 
movies in general. Smith believes that any movie has 
cultural ramifications.
He cites the most recent blockbuster, Jurassic Park, 
as an example. Smith had a lot to say about the movie 
that people watched mainly to see realistic dinosaurs 
and certain other special effects.
Smith believes that this monstrous phenomenon 
replaced the theoretical monster of communism that 
was destroyed at the end of the Cold War.
According to Smith, Jurassic Park also appealed to 
peoples fear about the technological future of genetic 
cloning.
Smith has written several other books for the aca
demic community, and also recently edited 
Madonnarama, a commentary on Madonnas Sex book.
The University of Minnesota Press published Clint 
Eastwood: a Cultural Production; this and some of 
Smiths other books can be found in local Pittsburgh 
bookstores or in the campus bookstore.

bc rmga:y fva'hx:
Andrew understands that his 
faithful audience  yes, both of 
youhave been wanting to know 
more about him. Therefore, he 
has decided to call this press con
ference to have me take questions 
and answer them in the honest, 
straightforward way you have 
become accustomed to whenever 
Andrew is involved. So when I 
call on you, please stand and ask 
away. You, in the slinky red dress, 
go ahead.
Is he the handsome, dreamboat, 
snuggle bunny that his writing 
suggests? Does he really have di
rect connections to power centers 
all around the world?
Yes, he is. Although, he is a 
little shorter than you might have 
imagined. And to answer your 
other question, yes. But, commu
nications with Mogadishu have a 
been a little shaky lately. Also, 
could I get your name and num
ber so Andrew could contact you 
later and go into more depth? 
Just walk up here afterwards and 
I will make sure he gets it. Thank 
you. Next, you in the Birkenstocks.
Has he ever, with malice afore
thought, snickered at people who 
wear Birkenstocks, white socks, 
and shorts  all at the same 
time?
Well ... no he hasnt. I mean, 
not as far as you know.
Did his mother drop him on his 
head when he was an infant?
Next, yes, you up front, please.
Is it true that he hears voices in 
his head?
Um ... just a minute, I have to 
consult someone. The voices have 
instructed him to answer no. You 
with the hat that says, Press. 
Why doesnt Andrew get with it 
and start dressing in 70s style 
clothing which has become all 
the rage?
Obviously, he doesnt have your 
keen fashion sense, sir. Another 
question?
Yes, why doesnt he drop this 
whole journalism bit and I use 
that word in the broadest sense 
and do somethinguseful? I mean, 
his brothers an accountant.
To quote Andrew, Although I 
love my brother, I would rather 
have someone ram pencils 
through my eyes than become an 
accountant.
I believe that sums it up rather 
nicely. Were getting to the end of 
our time limit so I can only take a 
few more questions. Yes, you 
please.
Is it true that Andrew gets defensive whenever his age is men
tioned?
Absolutely not. I am offended 
at the accusation. Its the rumor 
mongers such as yourself that 
give the press a bad name. Who 
do you work for, The Star, The 
National Enquirer? By the way, 
nice tie. What happened, did 
someone guess your weight 
wrong? Defensive, never. Last 
question. Yes, you, please.
Would Andrew, running short 
on his usual banal ideas, try to 
pass off something as contrived 
and mundane as a faked news 
conference where ficticious re
porters ask equally mundane 
questions?
Um ... well... no? I mean... um 
... not to my knowledge. I think.

gray lockers.
It wasnt as crowded as it was 
during Orientation when people 
didnt bother temporarily spar
ing a quarter to keep their back
packs out of the place, so they 
just slung their packs at the feet 
of a policeman. (If he had to go to 
the bathroom, a lot of packs 
wouldve been stolen.)
While checking out the book
store, I decided to do a little com
parison shopping on books for 
various subjects. Ittums out that 
math and science students are 
being charged the moon and the 
stars for their books.
If you look in the history sec
tion, 95 percent of their books are 
paperback and sell for between 
$8-$15 apiece. Directly across 
from history is the math section, 
where a 3/4 Intro to Modern 
Math book costs over $70. An 
Intro to Analysis book, the small
est book in the entire math sec
tion, runs for over $60.
It also seems that when science 
is integrated into another disci
pline it drives the price up even 
further. For example, in the ar
chitecture section, a huge book
simply titled Architecture costs 
$55.95. In the same section, Vec
tor Mechanics for Engineers runs 
for $71.15. In the social sciences 
section, Classics of Organiza
tional Theory costs $33.50, but 
Systems Analysis and Design will 
set you back $77.30.
Even in the sciences there ap
pears to be a bias toward biology. 
A huge two-inch book, Molecular 
Biology of the Cell, runs for $56.95. 
A comparable, smaller, general 
physics book costs $75.40. Judg
ing from the look of an ordinarylooking quantum physics book 
($83.85), it pays to be a quantum 
physicist. They must drive 
Lamborghini Diablos to work.
I found nothing in the ECE 
section for under fifty dollars.
The Heinz School section be
haves like architecture and so
cial sciences, but with economics 
driving up the price instead of 
science.
Speaking of goingup, there isnt 
much room in the bookstore to do 
that physically. The ceilings are 
low. (How low are they?) Theyre 
so low, a tall person can get a free 
and unexpected lobotomy on one
of the sprinkler system outlets.
The bookstore could be a little 
larger so at the beginning of each 
semester, people have room to 
walk and air has room to circu
late.
And could somebody tell me 
why they still sell five-subject 
spiral notebooks that are only a 
half inch thick? Unless someone 
was really lazy, theres no way 
possible to shoehorn fi^e college 
subjects into one of those things.
I noticed they sell electronic 
staples at the bookstore, but no 
electronic staplers.
Id also like to know why in the 
self help section the books about 
buying new cars are right next to 
the books on lesbian sex.
And for those who insist on 
complaining about the incredible 
cost of books, remember this  
the word affordable is not in the 
O College Bookstore credo by 
the board with the hours.
Tom Harper, a freshman, can 
still be found wandering around 
in the bookstore. In fact, he may 
still be in line, or talking to the 
policeman at the front door.

IMMEDIATE OPENING!
College T-shirts are cool
By MICKI KOCHANSKY.J
Tartan Staffwriter
Walking across the cut early morning one day last week, I 
finally succumbed to an urge thats plagued me for years. As I 
approached the Doherty Hall intersection I caught sight of yet 
another college T-shirt being taped to the wall by the doors. 
Normally I would have given it a perfunctory glance andhurried 
on-to class, but this time it was different. This shirt caught my 
eye. As X stepped up to get a closer look, I knew immediately that 
this shirt was mine. This shirt made me laugh.
Got this in anything less than an extra large? 1 asked the two 
enterprising guys who were thrilled to have a customer so early 
in the day.
Yep. Whatd you want, white or gray? I held it up  it was 
perfect.
Ill be back, I said as I rushed off to the nearest ATM to 
withdraw some cash.
Hehehe, thanks, one guy said as I handed over my ten bucks.
Yeah, cash. Thats cool. Hehe he he he. I was now the proud 
owner of my first college tee.
As I went about my business on campus that day in my new 
acquisition, I got a lot of comments. People Id never met were 
complementing me on my clothing.
Where did you get that? they asked. Are there any left? I 
felt for the first time that I belonged to the CMU community in 
a way I hadnt before. I began to notice and exchange eye contact 
with other people who were similarly clad, and shared acknowl
edging smiles with them.
It occurred to me that what I had done was not just buy a funky 
fashion statement on impulse, but invested in a solid memento 
of my rapidly dwindling college day s. I graduate next year. With 
luck, Ill not only have a brand-spanking new diploma to take 
with me, but a whole collection of wearable memories, too.
I wonder, in the years to come, if my children will also think my 
college tees are cool. I can see them now, paging through a dog
eared Thistle saying, Didnt Mom look funny? What about that 
hair! Check out those sneakers!
Now that I am a bona-fide college tee wearer, I have entered 
a whole new world of communication. I have been reading 
peoples backs as they walk in front of me. Inspired by what Ive 
learned, I now present my own addition to this form of informa
tion technology. Hehe he hehehe.
Top Ten Reasons To Buy College Tees:
1. The maroon 97 one is smelly now.
2. To prove you came here.
3. You had a spare ten bucks burning a hole in your back 
pocket.
4. They make excellent beer bibs.
5. Impress your friends back home with your new college 
savvy.
6. You need something to clean the windows with.
7. You havent figured out how to use a washing machine yet.
8. You misplaced your clothes at a party and need new ones.
9. Theyre a great place to insult members of other colleges for 
no good reason.
10. Theyre cool. He he hehehe.

shows and MTV and still plans on graduating despite suffering

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  7 September 1993
Carnegie Club provides for alumni, students
L3
By NICOLLE NO WITZ .
Tartan Junior Staff
T On August 5th, fellow CMU-ite 
Brendan McFeely, senior professional 
writing major, picked me up from work 
at about 5:30 pm. I stuffed the invitation 
to the Clan Gathering in my bag and 
headed down to the lobby. After a long 
/'and sweaty walk up to the comer of West
D' Street and Fifth Avenue in New York 
!ity, we finally arrived at the Carnegie 
!ellon Club. We were both quite imiressed that there was such a place, for 
hen we thought of Carnegie Mellon, 
ittsburgh usually came to mind.
I learned about the CMU Club after 
re were invited to the reception for new 
itudents. The reception takes place there 
nually so that new students can meet 
etuming students and alumni. New 
itudents, and their parents in some 
ises, are given the opportunity to ask 
[uestions and meet other CMU students 
and alums from the metropolitan New 
York area.
I As we walked through the door we 
Lnoticed a gold plated sign which read, 
'Carnegie Mellon Club. (I was im
pressed.) Next to the elevator, my friend 
pointed out a massive portrait of George 
Bush leaning on an arm chair, trying to 
look official. We reached the ninth floor 
and thanked the elevator operator. We 
had expected the entire floor to be a 
posh, leather armchair, loveseat type of 
club, but were disappointed to see that it 
was merely a room with a few tables, a 
piano, and a balcony overlooking Fifth 
Avenue.
Upon reaching the solarium we were 
greeted by a very enthusiastic woman 
asking if we were freshmen. We smiled 
and quickly said, Seniors, slapped 
Hello-my-name-is tags on our chests, 
and chatted with the alumni that we 
knew.
We recollected memories from last 
years Carnival and discussed our ex
pectations of the upcoming year. As we 
strolled through the solarium, trying to 
avoid alumni from the 70s, who seemed 
a bit too happy, we were cornered by a 
few freshmen who askedus about classes, 
our majors, professors we liked, classes 
we slept through, extracurricular activi
ties, and of course, the club scene in 
Pittsburgh.
As I left Brendan in the hands of a few 
freshmen women, I walked outside and 
looked down on the busy New York 
streets. Two graduate friends of mine
joined me, __________________________

Her last name (which was Doherty) 
stuck in my head and I was compelled to 
ask, Doherty? As in the building? She 
began to explain that she was the former 
President Dohertys daughter and also a 
CFA alum.
We compared notes on CMU and I am 
pleased to report that the stress level
and competitiveness we currently expe
rience have always been a factor at

Brendan away from the freshmen women 
hed been befriending. On the way out 
we were stopped by a Mech E alum from 
CIT and he grilled us again about the 
current goings-on around campus. Once 
he found out that we were English ma
jors, he suggested one of us write an 
article about the gathering (crazy idea!) 
so hopefully more returning students
and young alumni would attend the gath-!

EXPENSIVE, TRY PUTTING YOURSELF 
THROUGH RETIREMENT.
Think about supporting yourself for 
twenty-five, thirty years or longer 
in retirement. It might be the greatest 
financial test youll ever face. Fortunately, 
you have one valuable asset in your 
favor. Time.
Time to take advantage of tax-deferral. 
Time for your money to grow.
But starting early is key. Consider this: 
if you begin saving just $100 a month at 
age thirty, you can accumulate $172,109* 
by the time you reach age sixty-five.
Wait ten years and you'd need to set aside 
$219 a month to reach the same goal.

Alum helps bring Phantom to CMU
By TARA ZANE
Tartan Assistant Diversions Editor
I dont want to rub it in, but I have the 
best job in the universe! beams Lisa 
Vroman. This 36 year old may be petite 
in physique, but she is ever so powerful 
in personality and performance. Vroman, 
a 1981 graduate of Carnegie Mellons 
graduate music program, is back in town 
playing the lead role of Christine for 10 
weeks with the company of Phantom of 
the Opera. After performing around the 
country for the past seven to eight years, 
this last stop in Pittsburgh not only 
marks the end of the Phantom tour be
fore it returns to New York, but it also 
marks the end of an illustrious touring 
career for Vroman.
An offer to have first billing in a Phan
tom show opening in San Francisco has 
allowed her to finally settle down in one 
location and tend to her personal life 
more. I love my job. I love doing this, but 
its very difficult in this business to get 
your personal life on the same gratifying 
level as your career, especially traveling 
around, Vroman says, Its horrible trav
eling apart from loved ones. It definitely 
puts strain and weight on anybodys 
relationship.
Vroman speaks from experience, hav
ing come from a close family from the 
Thousand Islands region of upstate New 
York. She is the third of four children 
who were all very musical growing up 
due to the fact that their mother was a 
music teacher and choral director. In 
fact, Vroman had intended to follow in 
her mothers footsteps and be a music 
instructor. She obtained a bachelors 
degree in education at the Heinz School 
of Music in Pottsdam, New York.
It was during her undergraduate work, 
however, that Vroman participated in 
; the Summerstock theater program and 
found that she had a strong connection 
! with people who were performing. Be
sides singing for her hometown church
 choir, Vroman had not had a big vocal or 
theatrical debut prior to this, her first
tables in Brooklyn for nine months be
fore landing her first job with the Miami 
Opera. She sang in the musical The 
Fantastiks and the huge mainstage pro
duction of Carousel. The company that 
Vroman now works for generally man
ages and casts the parts for a number of 
the more popular musicals like Phan
tom of the Opera, Les Miserables, and 
Miss Saigon. They are in control of 
some of the biggest money-making com
mercial ventures in the business, so it 
behooves you to be responsible with this 
group of people, Vroman says; they 
have kept me working for the past six 
years. This is the same company that 
brought Vroman off the road and gave 
her a six-month Broadway debut in As
pects of Love. After that, she went back 
on the road again to play Fontine and 
Cosette for three years inLes Miserables.
Its rough working a five-show week
end and traveling on top of that, she 
confesses, Shows are run like a busi
ness and the people in charge really 
dont care. If youre burnt out, theyll 
just replace you. If you cant do it, there 
are so many unemployed actors out there 
who can. The most challenging thing 
Vroman finds about this profession is 
the stamina it requires. Being consis
tent, being a good comrade, and being a 
professional are three of the most impor
tant things to her. Having a good repu
tation makes a big difference in the 
hiring process. There are too many tal
ented people that have to suffer through 
someones bad attitude. Unless youre a 
supertalent, a bad reputation will not 
help your career at all, Vroman says.
Besides starring in Phantom of the 
Opera, Vroman is presently involved in 
an AIDS benefit called Phantom Voices 
that the tour tries to perform in each city
mainstage musical theater experience.
Music is second nature to me, and I felt 
that I had a good voice, but I did not 
know how much potential I had, she 
admits.
In order to discover that potential,
Vroman entered Carnegie Mellons. 
graduate voice program with the inten
tion of using it as a place to catch up with 
the artistic and technical voice training 
that she needed to make singing a ca
reer. She attributes part of her success 
to Beatrice Krebs (her voice teacher),
Ralph Zitterbart (her coach), and Rudy 
Feldman; all of whom shared their wis
dom, encouragement, and support to 
her at times when she needed it.
What does Vroman advise to aspiring 
young musicians? Get as much train
ing as you possibly can, Vroman ad
vises, The more skill you have, the more 
self esteem youll be able to maintain 
and the more com
petitive edge youll 
have with other 
people. Since most 
actors cannot read 
music at all,
Vromans abilities 
as a good reader, 
stylist, and rudi
mentary, technical 
musician enabled 
her to get two of the 
most important 
musical theater jobs 
in her life. She re
marks, Youhave to 
be patient, develop 
skills, keep trying, 
and trust yourself to 
overcome stress of 
dealing with the 
98% unemployment 
rate in this field and 
the slew of gradu
ates that come to 
New York City ev
ery year looking for
work. Out Buo34:p K:smt7 mo74 74:l7 e:f o cftod rHfs32 ftutof7oq e:f 4utsf ltfe:fpo3mt 4us7 H3rob o4 psr3s2u4

they are in. She acknowledges, So many 
of us have friends or have lost friends in. 
the business that are sick or dying of 
HIV, and becau&e of that we felt that we 
really needed to promote AIDS aware-, 
ness which is so desperately needed! 
across the country. Phantom Voices has! 
had performances in Seattle, Portland, 
and most recently in St. Paul, Minne-I 
sota where they raised $26,000. They 
usually choose to share the proceeds of 
this benefit with a small AIDS home 
with four to 10 beds that is desperately 
in need of the money.
In Pittsburgh, however, Phantom 
Voices has chosen to donate half of the 
proceeds with the Pittsburgh AIDS task 
force. CMU will be hosting this concert 
in Kresge Theater on Sunday, Septem
ber 12 at midnight. Vroman promises it 
to be a real eclectic incredible program, 
including ballet, opera, and musical the
ater. Since this concert will be a late 
night show, this particular program will 
be a little more casual, humorous, and 
entertaining. Watch for Vroman as she 
does an arrangement of the Beatles tune, 
In my life. She extends her thanks to 
Saul Markowitz, director of CFA public 
relations, and the Drama and Music 
Departments who all have been doing 
everything they can to help out the cast 
and crew of Phantom Voices.
Vroman has another year contract as 
' Christine, singing six out of eight shows 
a week in the Phantom of the Opera in 
San Francisco. If shes not completely 
over it by then, shes considering an
other six months work after that. As 
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette critic Robert 
Croan mentions, Vroman will continue 
singing with fluency and sensitivity, 
maintaining her stamina right to the 
end.
Tickets for Phantom Voices are now 
on sale at the drama box office (1 ticket 
for each valid student ID). Student tick
ets are parially funded by the Student 
Activities Fee. Hurry to get your hands 
on the few $5 and $20 student tickets 
left!
Fallen heroes a theme in new comics
Comic Book Chronicles
by Jason Andracki
Welcome to the first install
ment of Comic Book Chronicles. 
Hopefully, this will become a 
recurring part of The Tartan. 
Just as sort of an introduction, 
Id like to give somewhat of an 
overview of what I hope to dis
cuss here. Obviously, I plan to 
talk about comic books, but Id 
also like to discuss manifesta
tions of comics in movies, tele
vision, and music. Also, I plan 
to address the comic book in
dustry in general, specifically 
the subject of gimmick covers.
Well, enough of the prelimi
naries and on to the important 
stuff. This has definitely been a 
slightlyprofitable summer for 
the industry with sales reach
ing the $90 million mark. Actu
ally, comics have been selling 
in record numbers since last 
October with Supermans 
death. One of the hottest items 
this summer has been the 
Reign of the Supermen 
storyline contained in DCs four 
Superman titles. The Reign 
finally fell on August 25 when 
the true Superman made his 
return in Superman #82 which 
sported a $3.50 price tag due to 
extra pages and a chromium 
cover. I will speak no more of 
the gimmick cover for now. I 
was happy to see Kal-El back in 
the red and blue even though 
the black and platinum outfit 
was a good change. It will be 
interesting to see if the Super
man titles continue to be hot 
sellers now that the Death of 
Superman has been resolved. 
Just as an aside, two novels 
were also released on August
Jason Andracki is a 
freshman professional 
writing major, and he en

25, a hardback by Roger Stern 
titled The Death and Life of Su
perman and a paperback by 
Louise Simonson called Dooms
day and Beyond. Both chronicled 
the events of Doomsday, Fu
neral For a Friend, and Reign 
of the Supermen in novel form, 
with Simonsons book being 
aimed at younger fans.
Due to DCs extreme success 
with killing Superman, they did 
the same to Batman. OK, they 
didnt kill him, they broke him, 
but then again Superman isnt 
dead. So instead of Doomsday 
the Dark Knight had a 
Knightfall that crossed over into 
Batman,Detective Comics, Show
case 93, and Shadow of the Bat, in 
which Batmans spine was bro
ken by Bane, a new villain given 
tremendous strength by a drug 
called Venom. This resulted in
Bruce Wayne giving the mantle 
of the Bat to Azrael, Jean Paul 
Vallee.
Now, Bruce Wayne is laid up 
with a broken spine and there is 
a new Batman prowling the dark 
streets of Gotham. However, this 
is a more vengeful vigilante (not 
that Bruce was kind and gentle 
either) that even altered the near 
sacred Batman costume to re
semble that of Azrael. The new 
Batmans violent acts lead to a 
conflict between him and Robin, 
a conflict that has yet to be re
solved. Recently, Batman con
fronted Bane against Bruces or
ders and d.... (Sorry, no spoilers 
here. The issue just came outlast 
week.) Following the end of 
Knightfall is Knightquest 
which just began this week, so 
once again, I wont spoil anything 
for anyone.
Not to be left out of the torture 
your hero game is Marvel. Just 
as Superman had his Dooms
day and Batman his Knightfall 
so does Daredevil have his.Fall 
From Grace. Ive never been 
much of a DD fan; I think Marvel 
is just jumping on the bandwagon, 
so Im unfamiliar with this 
storyline. One thing I do know is 
that Frank (Dark Knight Returns) 
Miller and John Romita Jr. have 
returned to retell the origin of 
Daredevil, the character they 
made popular in the early eight
ies. They do this in the miniseries 
The Man Without Fear.
Although not involved in the 
torture your hero storylines but 
still making waves, are Image 
and Valiant. Both universes 
merge temporarily in the cross
over to end all crossovers, the 
Prestige format Deathmate se
ries. In addition to tie-ins with 
Valiant, Image is visiting other 
companies as well.
The Savage Dragon is espe
cially known for this with his 
one-shot Savage Dragon Ver
sus Megaton Man and the cur
rent crossover with Mirages 
Teenage Mutant NinjaTurtles. 
Not to be left out is Todd 
MacFarlenes Comic Book 
Buyers Guide Award-winning 
character Spawn. Spawn has a 
crossover in Neal Adams 
Valeria the She-Bat and has a 
two issue meeting with Batman 
and even a proposed crossover 
with the character that made 
Todd famous, Spider-Man.
Briefly, other news in comics 
over the summer: Jim Shooter 
leaves Valiant, founds Defiant 
Comics, and launches his line 
with a trading card series, 
Plasm. Dark Horse 
makes waves with its 
Worlds Greatest Comic 
Universe. Marvels Un
canny X-Men and the 
Avengers both celebrate 
thirtieth anniversaries. 
Jim Lees WildC.A.T.s get 
an ongoing series plus 
WildC.A.T.s Trilogy and 
a trade paperback of the 
limited series which also 
features a copy of WildC.A.T.S#0 thats unavail
able anywhere else.
Well, that about all for 
the summer of93. Be here 
next week when I discuss 
more topics in the comic 
book world.

El Mariachi
Mexican director Robert Rodriguez won an 
award at the Sundance independent film festival 
for this film about a musician who is mistaken 
for a hit man in a Mexican border town. Rodriguez 
made this film on a $7,000 budget, mere petty 
cash compared to the multi-million-dollar 
amounts that other contemporary films like Ju
rassic Park spend in their making.
It should be interesting to see how Rodriguez 
managed to turn such a small budget into such a 
highly acclaimed film.
This film should be a great lesson in economics 
for all you filmmakers out there and just plain 
interesting for everybody else.
In any case, it should be worth your dollar, if 
only to see how the hell Rodriguez managed to 
make this on $7,000.

Dragon: The Bruce 
Lee Story
This is the biographical movie about the king 
of kung-fu movies, Bruce Lee (Enter the Dragon, 
Fists of Fury, Game of Death). This criticallyacclaimed film goes beyond the scenes of his 
well-loved kung-fu flicks to expose the more 
personal life of the real man behind it all. This 
film looks at Lees life based on personal ac
counts and the accounts of those who worked and 
lived alongside him.
Kung-fu fans, this is certainly not one to miss.
At 6, 8,10 pm, and midnight.
Saturday, September 11
Benny and Joon
Look out folks, its Johnny. Depp again. This 
time he plays a wacky guy who falls for the 
slightly insane Joon.
This heartwarming movie is about how Joon 
learns how to be independent from her brother, 
her caregiver and guardian, much to his dismay.
This film is actually supposed to be not all that 
bad for a Johnny Depp flick.
And for all of you folks out there (if any of you 
still exist) who have been true to Johnny since 
his 21 Jump Street days, heres a bonus chance 
for you to get to see your beloved, and just for a 
buck!
How could you possibly pass up such an oppor
tunity ? Life could not get better than this.
At 6, 8,10 pm, and midnight.

Dragstrip Girl
Remember those good ol days of racing your 
car along those back street alleys to show your 
buddies how much of a man you were?
No? Well, thats ok, neither do I. But I do 
remember great dragstrip scenes from movies 
like Grease, or the dragstrip scene to end all 
dragstrip scenes, the one from Rebel Without a 
Cause.
Teen angst and frustration at its best. Hedo
nistic teens living life on the cutting edge. Who 
could ask for more?
Im not really sure if this movie has anything 
to do with teen angst, but it probably does. And 
it probably was made in the 50s-60s era, so it 
promises to have lots of tight sweaters, slick 
hair, leather, cigarettes, and switchblades. 
Should be a lot of fun.
And anyway, its Sunday night, youve got a 
buck, and you dont really want to do that pile of 
homework anyway, so why not go see this film?

CBS airs new Letterman show
commertertahmentcommentertainment 
J commentert
By FRANK MICHELS
Tartan Acting News Editor
Last Monday made college latenight history. If you walked by 
the Morewood TV Lounge or down 
any floor in Mudge House, you 
didnt see anybody watching The 
Tonight Show.
College students around the 
country are welcoming the new 
Late Show with David Letterman. 
And CBS made sure of that with 
an unforgettable summer slogan: 
Same Dave, Better Time, New 
Station.
Why? Why was there all the 
media hype? CBS spent $675 
million on advertising aimed at 
that young TV audience better 
known as us. Simply, CBS needed 
ratings, and ratings they got.
Over ten million viewers saw 
the first episode of the new David 
Letterman show. According to 
USA Today, the Late Show re
ceived a 10.9 rating, where a rat
ing equals 942,000 households. 
Why did they watch? I have three 
reasons.
First of all, hey, its Dave, and 
he has a new show. Those die
hard fans of his who remember 
Top Ten lists from years back 
were sick of the summer NBC 
reruns and wanted to see him 
live again. Now, performing at 
the newly renovated Ed Sullivan 
Theater in New York, Dave fol
lowers can once again laugh at
the world and its crazy ways.
Secondly, there has been a lot 
of mystery concerning the new 
show on CBS. Will David 
Letterman continue to have Stu
pid Pet Tricks, Larry Bud 
Melman, and the ever-popular 
Top Ten Lists, which were 
claimed as the intellectual prop
erty of NBC? Those occasional 
late-night viewers who only 
watched his show on a caffeine 
high now wanted to gain that 
extra hour of sleep and see if that 
same Dave was still the Same 
Dave.
On his first show, NBCs Tom 
Brokaw made a guest appear
ance (yes, on CBS) during 
Lettermans opening monologue, 
removed two of his cue cards, and 
said, These are the intellectual 
property of NBC. I doubt he was 
serious, but it proved just how 
stupid some issues can be.
Im sure fans were suprised 
when he did a Top Ten list, with 
fancy computerized graphics in
stead of the dull NBC blue-screen. 
On his second show, Letterman 
joked that NBC did surely sue 
me.
The third reason is new inter
est. Johnny Carson fans had no 
more Johnny, Jay Lenos jokes 
often bombed, and Arsenio Halls 
audience was sick of his Lets 
Party! attitude. The CBS media 
blitz was meant to attract new 
viewers with his witty sarcasm, 
but David Letterman said in an 
USA Today interview that latenight is about being brand new.
According to a Playboy Maga
zine college survey, 78% of col
lege men, and 49% of college 
women will more likely watch 
Letterman than Leno. Pitting the 
two shows head to head has re
heated the late-night talk show 
war, and Letterman is winning.
Letterman associates with his 
audience by making them feel 
acceptable in todays society. Not 
to sound like a social sciences 
professor, the Late Show with 
David Letterman laughs at the 
worlds oddities and therefore 
attracts viewers to his show with 
comical sarcasm.
Viewers are extremely happy 
to know that David Letterman is 
back  oh, we cant forget Paul 
Schaefer either  and probably 
even better than ever, because of 
his new found excitement on CBS. 
Unfortunately, we Carnegie 
Mellon students, along with thou. sands of other Pittsburgh view
ers, dont get the full benefit of 
Letterman at 11:30, because ...
Pittsburghs KDKA doesnt air 
the Late Show until midnight!!
A social travesty. I dont think 
Letterman suffered through the 
whole debate over an 11:30 time 
slot to.be shown after Inside Edi
tion! I urge you to call KDKA and 
tell those corporate no-goods that 
the Late Show with David 
Letterman should be aired at 
11:30, and move trash television 
to where it belongs in the trash.
Letterman is an escape. You 
forget your problems, and you 
laugh at everybody elses. 
Letterman has been called the 
funniest man on television. He 
needs no luck to win the latenight war; he has us.
