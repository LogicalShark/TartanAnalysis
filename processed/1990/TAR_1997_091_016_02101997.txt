University offers new 
academic programs
By JAYASAXENA
Tartan Staffwriter
Three new majors were ap
proved last week by the H&SS 
College Council and will be of
fered to students beginning next 
fall. Japanese will be offered as a 
major in the college of Humani
ties and Social Sciences 
(H&SS), and Human and Com
puter Interaction (HCI) and En
vironmental Policy will be of
fered as university-wide double 
majors. I think all three ma
jors, in a way, respond to stu
dent interest. All three have 
clear relevance for potential ca- : 
reers. This is an exciting stu
dent-oriented way to put together 
some of our existing staff, said 
Peter Stearns, dean of H&SS. 
We wanted to develop an under
graduate experience that cap
tures the strengths of CMU fac
ulty, providing a richer academic 
environment and additional op
portunities for undergraduates, 
said Richard Smith, associate 
dean of H&SS.
Student enrollment in modern
language departments in univer
sities across the nation is declin
ing, whereas interest in this area 
is on the rise at CMU, according 
to Stearns. This is one factor that 
led Keiko Koda, associate profes
sor in Japanese and Second Lan
guage Acquisition, along with 
other faculty members in the
first and second-year' students 
last year, interest was expressed 
in developing a high level of com
petence as well as cultural un
derstanding, according to Koda.
This major will be very de
manding, but what students can 
get in the end is functional com
petence and thats worth it. We

Please see MAJORS, page 5Committee searches for new head librarian
By MAUREEN McGRANAGHAN
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Provost Paul Christiano has appointed 
a committee to conduct a search for a 
new University Librarian, a position 
which has been open since Charles Lowry 
resigned last September to take a posi
tion at the University of Maryland. 
Lowry served as the head of all Carnegie 
Mellon libraries, including the Science 
and Engineering Library, Hunt Library, 
Mellon Institute, and the archives and 
special collections housed in Hunt and 
Hamburg Hall. The University librar
ian has a very multifaceted job, said 
Erika Linke, acting librarian and a mem
ber of the committee. I think we are
ultimately looking for someone who has 
leadership and innovation in informa
tion technology ... The national reputa
tion of the University libraries is based 
more on information technology and less 
on the collections. Thats what were 
known for and thats what we want to 
build on.
The committee, comprised of both fac
ulty members and librarians, met for 
the first time on Tuesday, February 4 
and established two subcommittees, one 
to devise a strategy for advertising the 
position and recruiting applicants, and 
another to develop a set of qualifications 
which will guide the selection process. 
Ordinarily we would have started early, 
but faculty who are familiar with the
library advised me that we should get 
further into the search for the president 
before we started bringingin applicants 
for the library position, Christiano said. 
In a position thats parallel with the 
deans positions, they [the applicants] 
would want to know who the new presi
dent is going to be.
Gordon Lewis, professor of sociology 
in the Heinz school and chair of the 
Committee, said, Charles Lowry made 
an enormous contribution to the Uni
versity, and our task is to find another 
person of comparable ability. Lewis 
served on the library selection commit
tee in 1991 as well as the committee that 
chose Lowrys predecessor, Thomas 
Michalak. .Lewis has also been on the
Faculty Senate Library Committee for 
several years.
The committee differs from previous 
librarian search committees in that it 
includes several librarians in addition 
to faculty members. Linke said, The 
last committee had just two librarians, 
and the remainder were faculty outside 
the library. This time theres an even 
split 50-50.
In conducting their search and outlin
ing selection criteria, the committee will 
refer to the official Statement of Carnegie 
Mellon University Libraries, taking into 
consideration the effects of technology 
on library science. Christiano said, I 
think library science is undergoing a 
revolution because of an electronically
based collection, and we want someone 
who is knowledgeable about electronic 
media and how that will affect the 
librarys holdings and the services the 
library provides.
Other responsibilities of the Univer
sity Librarian include reporting to the 
Provost and working with him on the 
librarys budget and priorities, chairing 
and managing various library programs 
and projects, overseeing a network of 
librarians specializing in different ar
eas, and serving on both the Provosts 
Academic Council and the Presidents 
Council.
Lowry held the position for four years 
from September 1992 to September 1996

Senate recognizes spirit club
By JIM CARNEY
I Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Spirit of Skibo, a club attempting to 
encourage school spirit and pride, was 
officially recognized by Student Senate 
at their meeting last Thursday. Im 
completely psyched. Were now no longer
I someones vision or 
dream. Were a real
ity. Were here to stay, 
said Eric Borts, presi
dent of Spirit of Skibo 
and a junior electrical 
and computer engi
neering major.
Recognition by Sen
ate requires a petition 
to the Funding and 
Recognition Commit
tee, including the 
organizations bylaws, 
a list of at least two 
officers, the name of 
an advisor, an autho
red signature for ac
counts, and the 
sources of any funding. This process can 
take several weeks, as was the case for 
the Spirit of Skibo. The group did not 
deceive funded recognition because it 
Permits people not associated with 
Carnegie Mellon-related to be members.
We wanted recognition to show eve*yone that were serious about sticking 
^ound for a while. Recognition also 
toakes running an organization easier.
Organizations are given mailboxes, are 
allowed to petition for funding, can sched
ule weekly meeting places, can set up 
organizational web pages, and other 
basic club-related things, said Borts.
After some question as to whether the 
Senate committee of Funding and Rec
ognition would recommend them, Spirit

of Skibo received a positive recommen
dation and passed by acclamation last 
Thursday. They wanted a non-funded 
recognition and special allocation for 
their next project, the Naked Pool Party, 
so we gave them both nonfunded recog
nition as well as the special allocation, 
said Geoffrey Go, a Senator and a fresh
man industrial management major.
Non-funded recognition grants Spirit
of Skibo reserved meeting places on cam
pus, setup displays in campus buildings, 
leaflet or petitions on campus, and the 
right to solicit special allocation from 
students on campus.
The purpose of the Spirit of Skibo, 
according to the clubs constitution, in
cludes promoting attendance at CMU 
events through the 
groups permeating 
enthusiasm, creating 
new events geared to
ward increasing stu
dent pride in Carnegie 
Mellon, raising 
awareness of cultural 
issues pertaining to 
Carnegie Mellon, and 
increasing student 
satisfaction and en
thusiasm.
The Student Senate 
granted Spirit of Skibo 
$640, which cannot be 
used for political, reli
gious, or academic 
purposes, for the NotSo-Naked Pool Party, because it is a 
school function and was in need of fund
ing. The funding will cover purchasing 
a movie, employing lifeguards, a secu
rity guard, and advertisement.
Spirit of Skibo, which was formed 
last semester helped promote the first 
home football game last semester, which 
had a large attendance, will attempt to

Dunham, who was SDC Films Chair 
for the past two years.
The picture will take up the whole 
screen, whereas now it only takes up 
about half of it, said Jarrod Wilson, 
the SDC Films Chair and a sophomore 
ECE and Music double major. Well 
have the best picture and sound in
"Right now we have Un mm films, [and] 
the sound is mono. Its basically like 
watching it on video."
 Brendan Dunham, SDC Treasurer
The idea is that, when the univer
sity center was being designed, they 
had intended McConomy to have a 35 
mm projector, but the budget for it 
was cut. This has been something 
that weve wanted to do for quite some 
time, said Brendan Dunham, SDC 
Treasurer, a senior EPP major.
Right now we have 16 mm films, 
[and] the sound is mono. Its basically 
like watching it on video. But for a 
dollar people dont usually complain. 
But if we could give them more for the
Oakland, added Wilson.
Theres only a couple of venues in 
Pittsburgh that have this, said 
Dunham.
Currently the closest movie theaters 
with Dolby Digital Sound are at Wa
terworks Mall and Monroeville Mall. 
The University of Pittsburgh does have 
a 35 mm projector, but does not have a 
digital sound system.
We are hoping to get this putin over 
spring break, said Dunham.

73 Israeli soldiers die 
in helicopter collision
AR YISHUV, Israel, Feb. 5 
(Reuter)  Israeli broadcast
ers read out names of the dead 
at hourly bulletins Wednes
day as the Jewish state 
mourned for 73 soldiers killed 
in the worst air disaster in its 
military history.
The cabinet and parliament 
observed a minute of silence for 
those who died when two U.S.- 
made Sikorsky CH-53 helicop
ter transporters collided Tues
day while heading to Israelioccupied Lebanon.
At least 20 victims were bur
ied in funerals throughout the 
country after rescue workers 
identified their bodies. There 
were no survivors. Most of the 
dead were around the age of 20.
Flags were lowered to halfmast and shops were closed. 
The official mourning period 
began Wednesday at 3 pm (9 
am EST) and ran until 7 pm 
(noon EST) Thursday. Reli
gious leaders called for a day 
of fast and prayer Thursday.
Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu, on a visit to the site 
of the crash near the Lebanese 
border Wednesday, said the sol
diers died on a mission to pro
tect Israel.
The people here know better 
than any how these soldiers and 
heroic commanders take risks 
to protect the residents of the 
north, he said at the village of 
Shaar Yishuv, where one of the 
helicopters fell onto a house. 
Nobody on the ground was hurt.
Our quest for peace involves 
constant sacrifices, constant 
risks, a grim-looking Netan
yahu said as he watched rescue 
workers search for body parts 
and personal belongings.
Netanyahu canceled meet
ings with Jordans King 
Hussein Wednesday and Pal
estinian President Yasser 
Arafat Thursday. An aide to 
Arafat said the meeting would 
take place Sunday.
The helicopters were flying to 
a nin- mile-wide occupation zone 
in south Lebanon that Israel 
carved out in 1985 to prevent 
guerrilla attacks. The pro-Iranian Hezbollah group, fighting 
to expel Israel from Lebanon, 
said the crash was an act of God.
We consider what happened 
a success granted by God ... I 
will use this occasion to express 
bighappiness and ask our people

Netanyahu mourns at the funeral 
of Kobi Ben Sheem.
and loved ones to pray to God 
and thank him, said Hezbollah 
deputy chief Sheikh Naeem
What happened was a Godly 
revenge for the children of Qana 
and for all those suffering arid all 
those killed in Lebanon, the 
bearded cleric said, referring; to 
the killing of some 100 civilians 
when Israeli gunners shelled the 
south Lebanon village of Qana 
during a 17-day blitz against 
Hizbollah last April.
Israels army chief Amnon 
Shahak said in a statement to 
soldiers that Israeli troops 
would remain in Lebanon.
The army is engaged in a 
never ending war, a drawn-out 
war to defend the state of Israel 
on its northern borders and 
throughout the country, he said.
The mission grows more and 
more difficult and sometimes 
hits too close to home ... (but) 
we will strengthen ourselves 
and comfort ourselves with the 
belief that the army can over
come this tragedy.
Defense Minister Yitzhak 
Mordechai named a five-man 
committee to investigate the di
saster but officials refused to 
speculate on its cause. Wit
nesses reported explosions af
ter the helicopters crashed, ap
parently from ammunition in 
the cargo.
In Israels previous worst 
military air disaster, 54 para
troopers died in a helicopter 
crash in 1977.
The question of Israels in
volvement in Lebanon had come 
up earlier this week when three 
soldiers were killed by a 
Hezbollah bomb.

Clinton reveals 
new tax policy
AUGUSTA, Ga., Feb. 5 
(Reuter)Kicking off his prom
ised national crusade to raise 
U.S. learning standards, Presi
dent Clinton Wednesday chal
lenged Americans to work for 
the greatest structure of edu
cation in the world.
At the same time, Clinton pro
moted one key element of his edu
cation agenda  a plan to offer 
$1,500 tax credits to encourage 
people to get more schooling.
Comparing his effort to the pro
gram that that brought electric
ity to rural America in the 1930s, 
Clinton told a large, friendly au
dience at Augusta State Univer
sity: Now we can come together 
and create the greatest structure 
of education in the world, but you 
cant just flip a switch  you 
have to go to work.
Clinton visited Georgia the day 
after his State of the Union ad
dress, which placed great empha
sis on education reform. Polls 
show a high level of public con
cern about the quality of U.S. 
education, and the Democratic 
president said Tuesday night his 
top second-term priority is to make 
the system the envy of the world.
In his Augusta speech, Clinton 
tried to create a sense of urgency 
for action, saying education 
should be improved now before 
Americas current run of peace 
and prosperity runs out.
Under Clintons HOPE schol
arship tax credit plan, any stu
dent enrolled in a community col
lege at least half time could get a 
$1,500 tax credit for two years as 
long as they earn a B average. 
The plan is modelled on a Georgia 
program that uses state lottery 
revenue to finance scholarships.
Senate Majority Leader Trent 
Lott, in a Washington speech to 
the National Association of Inde
pendent Colleges and Universi
ties, took pains to praise Clinton 
for his effort, while stressing that 
Republicans had concerns about 
the cost of the plan and did not 
buy all its specific components.
I think were getting close to 
doing some things, Lott said. 
The days when Republicans were 
not out leading and talking about 
education are over. Were going 
to contribute, were going to be
involved in this debate.
The Senate Budget Committee 
held its first hearing on the 
presidents 1998 budget, focus
ing on education. Chairman Pete 
Domenici, a New Mexico Repub
lican, objected that Clinton would 
put the lions share of the money 
in colleges when the basic prob
lems are in elementary and sec
ondary education.
Critics also contend Clintons 
plan could lead to grade and tu
ition inflation, with teachers giv
ing higher marks to help stu
dents qualify for tax credits and 
colleges raising fees to soak up 
money that would otherwise go 
to the U.S. Treasury.
Fuel cell delays 
shuttle launch
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla, Feb. 
8 (Reuter)  A suspect power 
generator may threaten NASAs 
plans to launch the space shuttle 
Discovery on a mission to up
grade the Hubble Space Tele
scope, officials said on Saturday.
Preparations for the shuttles 
planned 3:55 am EST blastoff 
Tuesday were proceeding 
smoothly, but NASA officials said 
they would not know until Mon
day if one of the spaceships elec
tricity-generating fuel cells was 
working properly.
The device, one of three aboard 
Discovery, uses supercold liquid 
oxygen and liquid hydrogen to 
generate power and also manu
factures water as a byproduct.
Engineers were concerned that 
the device might be contaminated 
with potassium hydroxide, which 
could make the shuttles drink
ing water too alkaline.
A fuel cell used by the shuttle 
Atlantis last September suf
fered a similar problem, which 
was later traced to a manufac
turing flaw.
Launch controllers planned to 
activate Discoverys suspect fuel 
cell, which has never flown be
fore, on Monday, five hours ear
lier than usual, to check whether 
it was working properly.
We do have a potential for de
laying the launch to look at that 
further, NASA test director John 
Guidi said at a news conference 
on Saturday.
If mission managers decide to 
replace the device it could post
pone the shuttles launch by more
than a week.
During the ten-day flight the 
astronauts planned to install two 
new scientific instruments in the 
telescope and upgrade various 
aging components.
Court judges 
on euthanasia
TALLAHASSEE, Fla., Feb. 7 
(UPI)Floridas Supreme Court 
was asked today (Friday) to over
turn a lower court ruling that 
would allow an AIDS patient to 
have a physician help him com
mit suicide when his death be
comes imminent.
A Palm Beach County judge 
Thursday lifted the stay that 
barred 35-year-old Charles Hall 
from taking advantage of a court 
decision that gzives him the right 
to a doctor-assisted death.
But state prosecutors are ask
ing that the stay be enforced as 
long as the case remains under 
appeal. There is no indication 
when the high court will rule, but 
Hall has said he is not prepared 
to use his right to die just yet.
Hall, who contracted AIDS 
through a blood transfusion, was 
one of three men who filed suit 
last year challenging Floridas 
128-year-old law prohibiting as
sisting a suicide.
The other two plaintiffs died 
before Jan. 31, when Palm Beach 
Circuit Judge S. Joseph Davis 
ruled that Hall has a right to ask 
his doctor for a lethal dose of 
medicine when he is near death, 
and that the physician should 
not be prosecuted for complying 
with Halls request.
Davis based his ruling on pri
vacy and equal protection provi
sions in the Florida and U.S. con
stitutions, but noted his decision 
applied only to Hall and his doc
tor, Cecil Mclver.
Robbers heldup business
PHILADELPHIA, Feb. 7 
(Reuter)More than 100 people 
were held hostage for several 
hours Friday in an apparent 
botched robbery attempt at a 
cash-checking business in north
east Philadelphia, police said.
Deputy Philadelphia police 
commissioner Richard Zappile 
told reporters as many as eight
robbers were involved in the hos
tage drama, which ended with
out any serious injuries.
Police spokesman Corp. Jim 
Pauley said all the hostages were 
believed to have been released 
from the Financial Exchange 
check cashing business. It ap
pears that way, but were not 
sure, Pauley told Reuters.
A Philadelphia police officer ac- | 
cidentally shot himself in the | 
hand during the tense standoff 
with the thieves and a pregnant 
woman was reported to have been 1 
taken to the hospital. No other 
injuries were reported.
Media reports said an employee 
of the Financial Exchange, where 
residents can cash checks, pick 
up food stamps, and obtain other 
financial services, was kidnapped 
and held overnight at her home 
at gunpoint with her family.
However, the robbery did not 
go as planned and customers ar
riving at the business were not 
allowed to leave, Pauley said. 
Police were alerted at 10:15 am.
After a stand-off with police 
lasting several hours, the hostage-takers allowed dozens of 
captivesincluding women andchildren  to slowly file out of 
the building.
CUNY to offer 
citizenship 101
NEW YORK,.Feb. 6 (UPI) - 
While the federal government is. 
making life more difficult for le
gal immigrants by cutting ben-- 
efit programs, the City Univer
sity of New York is trying to help. ,
CUNY is developing a class to, 
teach immigrants specifically 
about the naturalization pro
cess, forgoing usual courses in 
American history and English 
as a second language.
The program is designed to 
help students who are already 
permanent residents, but have 
yet to become citizens. The 
school will provide its immi
grant students with every
thing they need to obtain citi
zenship.
For the university, the issue 
is not just altruism. CUNY 
Chancellor W. Ann Reynolds 
tells The New York Times that 
with the change in federal 
policies, it is even more impor
tant that people become citi
zens quickly.
Merger creates largest financial service in US
NEW YORK, Feb. 5 (Reuter)
 Morgan Stanley Group Inc. 
and Dean Witter, Discover & 
Co. said Wednesday they agreed 
to merge, creating the largest 
financial services company in 
the United States.
The new companyto be called 
Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, 
Discover & Co.  will combine 
the retail brokerage and credit 
card businesses of Dean Witter 
with the professional investment 
management and securities un
derwriting of Morgan Stanley.
The companies said the com
bined operation will manage 
more than $270 billion in as
sets, the largest of any securi
ties firm, and have market capi
talization of $21 billion.
Dean Witter has 361 branch
offices with more than 9,000 ac
count executives, and its Discover 
credit card, with 39 million cus
tomers, is the nations third larg
est in terms of receivables.
Morgan Stanley, formed in 
1935, has 27 principal offices in 
19 countries and is a leader among 
investment banking companies, 
which provide securities under
writing services to corporations 
and governments and advice on 
mergers and acquisitions.
Under the merger pact, unani
mously approved by the boards of 
both companies, Dean Witter will 
swap 1.65 shares for each Mor
gan Stanley share.
Dean Witters stock closed 
Tuesday at $38.625, up 25 cents, 
and Morgan Stanley closed at 
$57.375, up 25 cents, both on the
New York Stock Exchange.
Dean Witter shareholders will 
own about 55 percent of the new 
company and Morgan Stanley 
holders about 45 percent. The 
new company will have a 14-member board to which each firm will 
nominate seven members.
The merger, expected to be com
pleted in mid-1997, will be ac
counted for as a tax-free pooling 
of interests.
Dean Witter Chairman and 
Chief Executive Philip Purcell 
will serve in those capacities af
ter the merger. John Mack, cur
rently president of Morgan 
Stanley, will be president and 
chief operating officer of the 
merged company.
Morgan Stanley Chairman Ri
chard Fisher will be chairman of
the new firms executive commit
tee of the board.
The firms did not say if any 
staff cuts were planned as a re
sult of the combination, but they 
did note there was little overlap 
between Morgan Stanleys invest
ment banking and institutional 
operations and Dean Witters re
tail focus.
This bold move will acceler
ate the ability of both compa
nies to achieve our respective 
long-term strategic goals,.] 
Mack said in a statement.
In connection with the deal, 
the firms said they granted each 
other options to acquire shares 
representing 19.9 percent of the 
other firm. Such options are of
ten issued to dissuade competing 
or disruptive counter-bids.

Its a question of finding the right 
places to pull the money from, said 
Witchner.
Currently Student Activities and 
Student Affairs have committed about 
halfofthe estimated $45,000 price tag 
for the upgrades.
They would get a loan, or maybe try 
to get funding from the student excess 
budget, said Dunham.Wilson said 
that other administrative organiza
tions are also helping with the project.
Dunham and Wilson both empha
sized that the cost of tickets would 
stay at one dollar. Were not goingto 
raise prices, the only change would be 
the quality, said Dunham.
The prices for 16 millimeter and 35 
millimeter films are the same price. 
The only cost increase would be ship
ping because of 35 millimeter films 
larger size.
The project has been supported a 
lot by student affairs. Michael Murphy, 
the dean of Student Affairs, has been 
a big supporter of this project. With
out him this wouldnt have happened, 
said Wilson.
We still have to talk about schedul
ing of the room and find out exactly 
where every dollar is coming from, said 
Dunham.
Due to the popularity of McConomy 
auditorium, not all films would be able 
to be scheduled there. Films will still be 
in 16 mm when shown in Doherty, said 
Witchner. The proposal for getting a 
new projector and Dolby sound has been 
around for the past few years. People 
wanted to put it in Doherty three years 
ago, but the projection booth was not 
large enough, and the room was too 
small, said Witchner. Witchner also
said that another issue was whether 
the system would be used enough to 
justify the expenditure.
Installation would be performed by 
Ultra Tech, the company that installs 
sound and projection systems for movie 
theaters, and by Pro Comm, the com
pany that helped set up the original 
system in the auditorium.
Itll be a great improvement and 
were all very excited, said Wilson. I 
suppose that the only thing that would 
bind us would be a money issue and I 
dont see that becoming a problem.

The current projector may be replaced by a 35-mm projector in the Spring.

LIBRARIAN, from page 1
after a year-long national search. Linke 
said, He was a very accomplished direc
tor. His resume was enormous and he 
was always publishing and speaking. 
He was the right person for us, but the
opportunity at Maryland was very com
pelling. At the University of Maryland, 
Lowry serves as both dean of Libraries 
and a professor in the College of Library 
and Information Science.
In his announcement of resignation
he wrote, It is my strong hope that this 
opportunity to combine both an admin
istrative career and the chance to teach 
the new generation of library and infor
mation specialists will prove as reward
ing as my time at Carnegie Mellon.
CIT develops ICES
The Carnegie Institute of Technology 
has opened the Institute of Complex 
Engineered Systems (ICES), a strategic 
initiative that builds upon the infra
structure created by the Engineering 
Design Research Center (EDRC). The 
EDRC is a National Science Foundation 
Engineering Research Center.
The first director of the new center 
will be Dr. Pradeep K. Khosla, professor 
of electrical and computer engineering. 
Khosla is also a faculty member in the 
EDRC and Robotics Institute.
Initially, the institute will focus on 
thrusts in embedded and reliable infor
mation systems, design and manufac
turing, and tissue engineering.
The first two thrusts directly build 
upon research within the EDRC. The 
tissue engineeringprogram, however, is 
a new initiative that will be pursued in 
collaboration with the Robotics Insti
tute.
ICES already has several projects in 
the defined thrust areas funded by both 
federal and industrial contracts. Sev
eral more of these strategic thrusts are 
planned, on which ICES will collaborate 
with federal agencies and industry.
ECEs earn honor
Erich Velandia, a sophomore in Elec
trical and Computer Engineering, won
second place for his technical paper, 
Concentrically Cylindrical Speaker 
Enclosure, presented at the National 
Technical Career Conference in Phila
delphia last week.
The conference, sponsored by the So
ciety of Hispanic Engineers, accepted 
only 15 undergraduate students from 
around the country.
Velandia used one of the Universitys 
Small Undergraduate Research Grants 
to fund his project and worked under 
the advice of faculty member Ned 
VanderVen.
Additionally, sophomore ECE major 
Blythe Dunham was awarded an Intel 
Foundation Women in Science and En
gineering Award scholarship. The 
scholarship involves a rigorous compe
tition, both at the University level and 
at Intel Foundation.
The scholarship provides full finan
cial support for tuition, fees, books, 
and a meaningful 10-week salaried 
summer internship at the Intel corpo
ration.

establish internships with 
Japanese companies in Pitts
burgh and Japan so students 
can learn the language in and 
out of the classroom.
Students will also have the 
option of double majoring in 
HCIand environmental policy. 
The curriculum for HCI focuses 
on the design, implementation,
that exists between the different 
colleges, he. said. Students accepted'into this program will be 
required to take classes from 
H&SS, the College of Fine Arts, 
and the School of Computer Sci
ence. HCI represents major 
strengths within the University. 
We never had an undergraduate 
program that would allow under
graduates to experience and benIt will help to overcome a separation that 
exists between the different colleges. 
 Richard Schemes, senior research scien
tist, philosophy department
arid evaluation of interactive 
computer-based technology. 
We wanted to add to computer 
related options within H&SS, 
Stearns said. There is a big 
niche open to people majoring 
in one field and specializing in 
HCI. These students will have 
a big edge in the marketplace, 
said Richard Scheines, senior 
research scientist in the Phi
losophy Department. It will 
help to overcome a separation
efit from these strengths, Smith 
said. The major will be run by the 
HCI Institute, part of the School 
of Computer Science, and will 
provide students with the option 
of entering an accelerated pro
gram in which they can receive 
an undergraduate as weir as a 
masters degree in five years.
For the past year and a half, 
the Environmental Studies Com
mittee has been working to es
tablish a major in environmental
policy. Student requests and 
the demand for people with 
experience in dealing with the 
environment are two reasons 
this major was created, said 
Peter Madsen, the executive 
director of the Center for the 
Advancement of Applied Eth
ics. Astudentwill be very mar
ketable if they have environ
mental awareness and this 
major gives stu
dents a good, 
general background, 
Scheines said. 
According to 
Madsen, pos
sible job oppor
tunities resultMIUIIBIII illHM ing from a ma
jor in this area include work
ing in government policy and 
decisionmaking, serving as an 
Environmental Affairs Officer 
in a corporation, and working 
in research involving science 
and technology. Im looking 
forward to being one of the 
administrators with this pro
gram along with committee 
members. It will be a reward
ing challenge to work with this 
program, Madsen said.
Crime and Incident Report
THEFT 2/2, 10:50 am  A 
University Center Dining Super
visor reported a theft to Campus 
Police. Upon arriving at the UC, 
police learned that one of the 
employees was missing $20 from 
his register. The employee stated 
that he had counted and placed 
his cash drawer, containing $150, 
into his register at Sweet Sensa
tion. He locked his drawer and 
went to the restroom for approxi
mately five minutes. Soon after 
returning, he thought his cash 
drawer looked low. The dining 
supervisor counted the money in 
the drawer and found it was $20 
low. There were no signs of forced 
entry to the drawer, and the din
ing supervisor told police that 
the employee has had previous 
disciplinary actions due to regis
ter shortages.

scribed as a black male, approxi
mately 42 years old, 511 with 
salt-and-pepper hair and a 
chipped front tooth, entered the 
Shoppe and asked for change for 
a $5 bill. The employee, recogniz
ing the man, pressed the stores 
panic button and tried to stall as 
she waited for Campus Police to 
arrive. However, the man left 
before the Police could arrive and 
could not be located.The man is

who committed a theft last year.
THEFT OF SERVICES 2/4,

With the recent success of the 
Business Oppurtunities Confer
ence (BOC) and the Technical Op
portunities Conference (TOC), 
H&SS and MCS joined together 
last Thursday to provide a job fair 
that supposedly catered to liberal 
arts and. science students. Al
though many students in both of 
these colleges had anxiously 
awaited such an opportunity to 
meet with prospective employers, 
few actually attended the fair and 
judging from what was offered 
its no mystery why student num
bers were so low. The job fair 
contained the same atmosphere 
as the BOC and the TOC, but at a 
fraction of the size  there were 
few companies represented that 
were offering non-technical jobs. 
In fact, the fair seemed to cater to 
only the technical majors offered 
in H&SS and MCS.
One of the reasons that the BOC 
was so successful was that that 
committee members through the 
industrial management depart
ment saught out student input 
before inviting companies to CMU 
to ensure student satisfaction.
It seems that neither MCS nor 
H&SS took into account the ac
tual needs of their students when 
planning the job fair; few liberal 
arts or research employers were 
represented. The planning com
mittee could have looked into 
bringing representatives from
newspapers and publishing com
panies, hospitals, research firms, 
public relations, or government 
agencies; instead technologicial 
opportunities again dominated 
the few offers that'were available 
at the H&SS/MCS job fair.
Of the companies that were 
there, few were currently offering 
positions or werent sure if posi
tions would be available in the 
near future. Even students that 
were interested in companies that 
were present at the job fair left 
dissatisfied after speaking with 
recruiters. There was a lack of 
energy and excitement that ac
companies job fairs at CMU. Stu
dents were disappointed at the 
small turn out of companies at
tending and futher disappointed 
to find that companies were only 
looking for technical skills.
Students in H&SS and MCS 
have been overshadowed by 
CMUs technical reputation for 
so long that it is important to 
provide them with opportunits 
to prove themselves to employ
ers. Both colleges should be com
mended for trying to fill this 
need, but they need to rethink 
who the target audience is; CMU 
has more to offer beyond com
puter and engineering back
grounds. The companies invited 
to job fairs should represent the 
diversity of CMU students and 
their talents.

Newspapers in general are rela
tively predictable  theres the 
news section, the sports section, 
and the comics, usually along with 
living and entertainment sections. 
Often, there is very little opportu
nity to respond to what we see in 
print. At The Tartan, we find a lot 
of value in the exchange and in 
the frequent clash of ideas. The 
Forum pages are our way of fos
tering free exchange of ideas, so 
we try to provide a spectrum of 
opinions to allow you, our read
ers, to be the judges. To that end, 
youll find the following types of 
pieces in this section:
Editorials always appear in the 
leftmost columns of the first Fo
rum page. They are unsigned be
cause they represent a consensus 
opinion oiThe Tartans Editorial 
Board.
While we believe our editorials 
offer sensible, accurate commen
tary, please feel free to disagree 
with us  we dont have a mo
nopoly on the truth. As a matter 
of fact, we would love to know 
what you think of what we think. 
An excellent means to do this is to 
write a letter to the editor.
Letters to the Editor may be 
submitted by anybody, although 
when space gets tight we will fa
vor letters from members of the 
University community. As read
ers, you should realize that opin
ions represented in a letter are 
those of the author and not of The 
Tartan. All letters are subject to 
editing for size  letters cant be 
more than 500 wordsand gram
mar. But we never edit a letter for

content.
Of course, we reserve the right 
to reject letters we feel are libel
ous, obscene, or incoherent. But 
well be glad to discuss any letter 
with the author and see if we can 
reach a compromise. However, in 
order to have such a discussion, 
we need to know who you are. We 
are willing to withhold the 
authors name from a letter to the 
editor, but our editor-in-chief does 
need to know who wrote it. Please, 
dont send us anonymous letters
 it just frustrates us because we 
have no way to contact you, and it 
annoys you because your letter 
doesnt get published.
Persons Opinion is just that  
the opinions of randomly polled 
persons, usually students at 
CMU, on a different question or 
concern each week. The people in 
Persons Opinion have no affilia

Columns are regularly appear
ing opinion pieces presented by 
individuals who are usually mem

Unsolicited columns generally 
cannot be used, though if you feel 
the desire to contribute regularly, 
contact the Forum editor.
Opinions in these columns are 
those of the columnist and not of 
The Tartan. Again, feel free to 
disagree with them and to let them

Letters to the Editor
Letter to 
the Editor
Editor,
James Stepaneks 
recent editorial oppos
ing same-sex mar
riages (Legality 
slights family impor
tance, 2/3/97) was rep
resentative of most attacks against samesex marriage in that it was a ludicrous 
attempt at argumentation rife with logi
cal fallacies. Clearly Stepanek does not 
understand the furor over gay marriage.
Stepanek apparently believes that 
same-sex couples can never be fami
lies because they can never have chil
dren. He even goes so far as to ac
knowledge the fact that the couples 
can adopt children, only to dismiss 
this argument as mere hand-waving 
and ignoring the fact that marriage is 
about families.
The core of Stepaneks argument can 
be summed up in one sentence: Mar
riage is based on families, families are 
based on children, and same-sex couples 
cant have children, even adopted ones, 
because they arent families. Perhaps 
Stepanek should research the phrase 
circulus in demonstrando. (One can won
der whether Stepanek is as opposed to 
opposite-sex sterile couples.)
Not content with a single logical fal
lacy, Stepanek continues by stating that 
gays want to marry for only two reasons: 
to gain acceptance from society, and out 
of greed. This is known as bifurcation 
and it is also logically fallacious. In truth, 
there are many reasons that same-sex 
couples can in fact care for each other, or 
that every same-sex relationship is not 
based purely on sex. Stepanek sup
ports his argument with the ridiculous
proposition that, if same-sex marriages 
were legal, what would stop him from 
marrying a friend of his who he rooms 
with, doesnt sleep with, and collect the 
benefits? The fact is that he is free to do 
that already  perhaps he doesnt real
ize there are women in the workforce 
today.Altogether Stepanek seems more 
concerned with defining a family as a 
means for breeding and with ignoring 
the possibility of adoption than with 
presenting a cohesive argument.
Everyone is entitled to an opinion, but 
those with the gall to publish them
selves as frequently as Stepanek does 
should at least aim for some semblance 
of logical correctness.

Surplus should fund events calendar
Michael Sperger
Have you heard 
the news? Student 
Senate has an ex
tra $100 million 
laying around!
When you look at 
the wave of sugges
tions posted to the assocs.surplus bboard regarding how to 
spend Senates $80,000 budget jackpot, you have to wonder if 
were doing enough at this school to teach people about 
economics and finance. The following suggestions, for in
stance, actually fall more in the category of million-dollar 
capital projects than rainy day spending sprees:
Give the money to the fraternities to help them improve 
the physical appearence of what were supposed to be 
temporary buildings.
I think that you should use the money to help build another 
dorm with sweets [sic] or apartments.
This last item will likely cost about $10 million when the 
University gets around to building new housing. Facilities 
are expensive. You could probably land a nice home in 
Bloomfield for $80,000 if you were buying, but building or 
renovating facilities on campus will cost quite a bit more than 
any student group can afford to spend. Fundamentally, though, 
is this the kind of thing on which Senate should spend our 
Activities fee money?
Senate focuses on an aspect of the community that is either 
pretty wide or pretty narrow depending on how you consider 
it. They do provide funding and support to almost every 
student organization on campus. But as this past week has 
shown, their responsibilities extend to only one portion of the 
large spectrum of things students deal with from day to day.
The Surplus Commission convened to sift through these 
suggestions must come to a decision based on two criteria. 
One, the winning suggestion must focus on supporting stu
dent activities. We all paid into this fund through the Student 
Activities Fee, and it would be inappropriate to take activity 
money and spend it on something unrelated.
Two, the $80,000 solution must be permanent. Already
about 20 percent of all student organization money on cam
pus goes to Spring Carnival, a three-day event. Granted, 
much of that 20 percent funds booth and buggy organizations 
that are active throughout the year. But the point is that 
were big spenders when it comes to one-time special events, 
and usually less eager to invest in longer-term ideas. There is 
a difference between an expense and an investment. Right 
now we have mostly expenses. Senates bonus bucks provide 
an opportunity for organizations to change the trend.
Heres my suggestion for-the Surplus Commission: invest 
about half of the money in the present efforts to create an 
effective University-wide master calendar of events. EventPub 
and the kiosks around campus never took off because they 
lacked funding and support from the right places. Ever}' 
student organization has an interest in publicizing its activi
ties. Anne Witchner in Student Activities is leading the 
charge to give student organizations an efficient system for 
promoting themselves.
Support the work of her team by offering to hire a part-time 
data entry person to keep things current or to fund purchase 
and installation of the necessary system hardware. In short, 
bring together the full resources of this community to ad
vance your primary cause  helping students reach out to 
each other through activities. (Full disclosure: I sit on the 
University Student Affairs Council, which recently heard a 
progress report from Witchners task force. So far there has 
been no mention from the task force of asking Senate for 
project funding.)
As for the other suggestions, I hope that some key admin
istrators are paying attention to them. What has formed over 
the past week is not just a set of ideas for Senate, but a wish 
list for the entire University. May all our wishes, or at least 
some of the more reasonable ones, come true.

Computers place limits on social skills
Editor's Notebook
When was the last time you named 
youi* hammer? And your screwdriver? 
Do you refer to a pen as she or he? 
If youre like most well-adjusted, ra
tional individuals, the answer to these 
questions would likely be no. And thats 
a good thing, as these objects are merely 
tools, implements for making a task 
simpler and our lives easier.
So allow me to pose another question: 
Why do we name computers? Why do we 
treat them like entities unto themselves: 
like living, thinking individuals?
In the last decade, the electronic 
world has been honed into a commercially distributed, everyday part of life. 
For many, it has become dominating 
and all-consuming.
Many will defend the digital world to 
the end, while others will reject it wholly. 
What seems to be misunderstood is that 
computers are tools; they are a means to 
an end  nothing more.
What is scary is what has happened to 
some individuals since the integration 
of computers into normal life  the 
cyberworld has largely replaced the 
real world for these people. They spend 
hours on end interacting only with com
puters  the Web, Doom, et cetera  
until the point that they cannot interact 
with other people properly.
Their interpersonal skills degrade to a 
level on which their only perceptions of 
reality are the things they have read on 
the Web page of someone whose life 
experience is just as limited.
This is a problem, folks. Computers 
are objects  dumb and useless without
human interaction, programming, and 
engineering. Its time that we begin re
garding them that way.
Yes, computers are valuable. Yes, they 
are important. Yes, they have deep pen
etration into society.
But that doesnt make them human, 
or more valuable than their users. Most 
importantly, it doesnt make them 
more important than other persons 
their views, opinions, and abilities.
Life is short. As World History class 
undoubtedly taught you, mans rea
soning for developing technology has 
been simple: to make life easier and to 
increase leisure time.
And thats precisely what computers 
are for; theyre there to help. Dont con
fuse them as the purpose of your lifeKenneth Kraemer is the Acting Tan

Columnists debate OJ. Simpson media craze
Media spotlights flaws in justice system
Alex Lewin
O. J. Simpson used to live in the house 
across the street from me. This was 
about 15 years ago, before my family 
and I were living in Los Angeles, so we 
never knew him. But a couple of weeks 
after Simpson was arrested for the mur
ders of his ex-wife and her friend Ronald 
Goldman, reporters were swarming 
around the house across the street like 
bees around a hive. An NBC reporter 
came to my door and asked if I had 
known O.J., or if I knew anyone in the 
neighborhood who had.
Certainly, this was all a bit much, and 
at the time I was appalled that these 
reporters and camera crews would be 
wasting their time by canvassing a 
neighborhood that hadnt seen O.J. 
for over a decade.
Butin light of last Tuesdays verdict, it 
seems we ought to be grateful now for 
the attention the media has given to the 
O.J. Simpson affair. This media circus 
has brought to light a problem that no 
one has ever seriously considered be
fore: flaws in our justice system.
I dont know whether O.J. is innocent 
or guilty, nor am I in a position to specu
late. But something is rotten when a 
criminal jury finds him not guilty of the 
murders, but a civil jury finds him liable 
for the murders.
Certainly, there are differences be
tween a criminal trial and a civil trial. 
One is about guilt and the other is about 
liability, two terms which are usually 
not synonymous. But in a case like this, 
they are the same  the only way O.J. 
can be liable for the murders is if he 
committed them, and thats what the 
plaintiffs lawyers in this civil trial set 
out to prove. The civil jury believes that 
O.J. is a killer.
Given that, lets say that O.J. is guilty 
and the recent verdict is accurate. Why 
didnt he go to jail? Because O.J.s de
fense team in the criminal trial proved 
there was a reasonable doubt in the 
prosecutions case, and therefore the 
prosecution didnt do its job.
But can a man go free because 
Marcia Clark and Chris Darden were 
mediocre prosecutors? The trial was 
more like a stage play, and the ju
rors were the critics. It was about 
which side did a better job of repre
senting their clients than it was 
about the evidence.
If O.J. is guilty, he deserves to go to 
jail. If hes innocent, he should not be 
forced to pay compensatory and puni
tive damages. One of these juries is 
wrong. And because the magnitude of
Trial does not merit excesses attention
||
Chris Cannon
I want to tell you about a man who killed 
his ex-wife and her waiter. Or maybe he 
didnt. It depends on which jury you ask.
Actually I dont want to tell you about 
him at all. Most likely you have heard 
all about him already.
this discrepancy is why we should be 
glad that every minute of the crimi
nal trial was televised, and every 
aspect of the case dissected by tele
vision legal experts.
Though it has been extreme at times, 
on the whole, our country will benefit 
from the fact that we have been ex
posed to the legal process in a way that 
many of us never considered before, 
because now we know that the justice 
system is flawed. We watched it in 
action and saw it go wrong. Now that 
we know theres a problem, its up to 
us to decide how to fix it.

Noah Simon/Tartan Art Staff
In fact, I dont even want to mention 
his name.
Two and a half years ago you may have 
been enjoying an NBA playoff game, but 
were suddenly switched to him in his white 
Ford Bronco leading a pack of police cars 
on a low-speed chase. Perhaps you took 
time out of your morning to watch some 
live coverage of his criminal case a year 
ago. Just last week you might have been 
watching the end of Presidents State of 
the Union address. But instead of receiv
ing immediate responses from other lead
ers in the country, you were distracted 
by the results of his civil suit.
You probably talked about him in the clus
ter, playing basketball, or wherever your fa
vorite hangout may be. You may have enjoyed 
the countless jokes about him and the victims 
on the Internet, TV, or even made up your own
around the dinner table.
But its too much. The media cover
age is overblown. Its not news any
more. Its old, over, done with. Lets 
move on.
It has become a distraction. The 
medias obsession with one mans legal 
troubles commands too much of our 
time and energy. Perhaps the impact 
of the case warranted diverting our 
attention from a sporting event. It could 
be important enough to suspend our 
daily lives to consider what the tale 
tells about American society. But when 
it interrupts the replies on what the 
leader of our country plans for our 
future, it has gone too far.
By continuously force-feeding us 
the story, we only become desensi
tized to the reality that too many 
sour relationships end in violence. 
It also shows a callous disrespect for 
the victims. Whats worse is that 
rather than featuring programs and 
news coverage on the symptoms of 
aggression the acquitted killer 
showed and the after-shocks of ho
micides, the press continues to focus 
on the mans social life, the dead 
womans possible lovers, and whether 
or not he can pay the amount awarded 
in the civil suit.
The most tragic element on the me
dia side of the story is that programs 
that fully embraced and exploited 
the double murder (Hard Copy, Ex
tra, 20/20) made killings in the rat
ings wars, while those that pursued 
true journalism {60 Minutes) were 
hung out to dry.
How much coverage is enough? The 
man was tried, acquitted, and con
victed. Is there a moral to the story?
There are problems in the legal 
system in this country. Is this news 
to us? The media should focus on the 
legal issues rather than the man.
Find the troubles, fix them, or 
come up with the best working solu
tion that you can. Just dont tell me 
about whos getting away with mur
der. Ive heard it already.

Freshmen should have more say in their meal plan
Ellen Beldner
The first time I ate at High
lander, I thought the food wasnt 
too bad. It was during Orienta
tion week, when Id go and eat 
with all the people on my floor, 
digging through sandwiches, 
waffles, pizza, and frozen yo
gurt. As the semester progressed 
and my enthusiasm for High
lander fare waned, I still didnt 
mind  between the bagels, 
veggie burgers, and salads, I 
could use up nine or 10 of my 12 
meals per week without a sec
ond thought.
But over winter break, some
thing happened: I got to eat real 
food every day. When I came 
back to campus for the start of 
second semester, with memories
of my mothers spinach lasagna 
fresh in my mind, suddenly even 
the thought of a veggie burger 
made me lose all semblance of an 
appetite. With only $15 each week 
in DineXpress money, like most 
freshmen, I had no choice but to 
choke down Highlander food. And 
even now Im still stuck with eight 
Highlander meals and a mere 
$30 in DineXpress per week.
The general consensus on cam
pus about Highlander food is that 
it sucks. The most charitable com
ment Ive heard is that the food is 
edible but eminently tiresome 
after week upon week of ham
burgers and scrambled eggs. Con
versely, most students enjoy the 
diversity that they find from the 
independent food vendors on cam
pus, such as Skibo Coffeehouse, 
Wok cn Roll, and The 0.
CMUs Dining Services has at 
least partially immunized High
lander from the market forces
that drive all of the vendors busi
ness practices. All freshmen are 
required to purchase a meal plan, 
with a minimum of eight High
lander meal blocks each week. 
Even if the freshmen dont use all 
their meal blocks  each costing 
an average of $5  in a given 
week, Highlander still receives 
the money from the unused 
blocks. The freshmen, who have 
paid for this meal plan already, 
cannot get any unused money 
back. Basically, Highlander gets 
the same amount of money, re
gardless of the quality of its food.
The real problem is that fresh
men have very limited, and very 
bad, meal plan options. Fresh
men can have one of the following 
options: 14 Highlander meals per 
week with no DineXpress money, 
12 meals and $15 DineXpress, 10 
meals and $20 DineXpress, or 
eight meals and $30 DineXpress.
The University defies all logic
in giving freshmen only these 
options. Why is there no option of 
having, say, $80 per week in 
DineXpress and zero Highlander 
meals? The administration 
should be made aware that many 
students detest Highlander fare 
and would rather not have to 
spend their money on food that 
they will not eat.
For students who do like High
lander food, there is nothing to 
prevent them from purchasing 
the 14 meal-per-week plan. But 
the University does its freshmen 
a great disservice in demanding 
that they cough up money for 
something from which freshmen 
derive no benefit.
Requiring freshmen to have 
some sort of meal plan is a good 
idea. Generally, incoming fresh
men dont know enough about 
college living to make a qualified 
decision between having and not 
having a meal plan. They can,
however, think. And if a fresh
man decides that hes not partial 
to the Highlanders Mystery Meat 
Special, he should be allowed to 
transfer his money to a form that 
allows him to buy whatever food 
he wants.
As much as we all love those 
semi-solid Highlander veggie 
burgers and overcooked pasta 
servings, Im sure that wed all 
much rather dine on a lox sand
wich from the Bagel Factory or a 
chicken pita from Porter Halls 
Gourmet Ave.
It may be eat-and-run and it 
may cut down on Highlanders 
budget, but hell, its our money 
and we should be able to spend it 
how we choose.

Uni vernsty Gary Wills
Uni ossfy Lincoln at Gettysburg: The Worlds that Remade America 
Uni wiacidity Scott A. Sandage
Scott A. Sandage is assistant professor of history at Carnegie Mellon and a mem
ber of Phi Beta Kappa. His research as a cultural historian includes both the 
American fear of failure and the political undertones of commemoration. His 
1993 Journal of American History article on protests at the Lincoln Memorial 
won best article prizes from the Organization of American Historians and the 
Eugene V. Debs Foundation. He has this to say about the author and the book:
Abraham Lincolns gifts as a writer have been much praised. Garry Wills 
explains them in this truly illuminating rhetorical analysis, going so far as to 
diagram Lincolns sentences. Along the way, Wills makes the Greek revival, 
the cemetery beautiful movement, and transcendentalism necessary to any 
deep understanding of the Gettysburg Address. As resident gadfly at the New 
York Review and in fifteen diverse books, Garry Wills is (at his best and his 
worst) probably the H.L. Mencken of our time. Wills combines fearless origi
nality with treacherous hyperbole. By way of healthy skepticism, I suggest that 
readers weigh carefully the argument made in Wills subtitle: The Worlds that 
Remade America.

CMU limits potential
Cameron Dezen
The first day 1 walked through the 
great metal doors, security guards, 
and ID check at LaGuardia High 
School for the Performing Arts in New 
York City, I had a clear image in my 
head of what the next three years 
would be like. I envisioned kids 
breakdancing on cafeteria tables and 
in the halls, breaking into song during 
math class, dancing in the streets.
As a vocal major, I was excited to get 
involved with dance and drama, know
ing LaGuardia had the best instruc
tors in the city, and that they would be 
willing to get involved with kids from 
other departments. Basically, I 
thought that there would be a dia
logue between the different depart
ments; art, drama, dance, and voice.
This was not the case at all. I had 
very little exposure to the other de
partments, and only hung out with 
vocal majors. When I arrived at 
Carnegie Mellon as a freshman, I ex
pected tilings to be different; I expected 
involvement between the departments, 
so I didnt think I would need to be a 
voice major in order to find an outlet for 
singing. After almost four years, I've 
found that there is little effort made on 
the part of the departments to get to
gether. Like LaGuardia, CMU func
tions as a conservatory. Each depart
ment focuses on trainingtheir students 
in a classical manner, which leaves 
little room for inter-departmental ac
tivity. My high school had a few groups 
that met outside of school to put on 
productions that got different lands of 
kids together, but like Scotch N Soda, 
these groups had low membership and 
didnt get much attention from the stu
dents or faculty.
And also like at CMU, the kids at 
LaGuardia were too busy, loaded with 
work from their departments, to devote 
a lot of time to outside activities.This 
fall, my roomates and! turned the firstfloor of our big old house into an, art 
space [Ed. note: see Students turn 
house into studio, The Tartan issue 
#15]. Our intention was to create a 
space free from a conservatory atmo
sphere, for all kinds of artists to get 
together. To mix performance with 
visual, as well as other kinds of art. So 
far its worked out well. Both CFA and 
H&SS kids would benefit tremen
dously during and after college from 
the kinds of connections they canmake
across department lines. Artists can 
leam a lot from business and informa
tion systems majors, about how to put 
their own shows/performances to
gether with the most minute damage 
to their finances. The potential for 
fledgling businesses is huge as well. If 
nobody will show your art, start a 
gallery. If no one will produce your 
plays, start a theater. If nobody will 
produce your music, do it yourself. Its 
difficult, but not impossible. Last 
spring I was able to record and pro
duce four songs, using the highesttech equipment, with a Small Under
graduate Research Grant and the 
kindness of Riccardo Schulz, who is in 
charge of recording for CFA. I per
formed the material at The Frame 
(formerly Forbes Gallery), and hope to 
make it available to the public with 
the help of my more business-minded 
friends. As the art market (from mu
sic to drama to dance) is inundated 
with starry-eyed college graduates, 
those who have a sense of business, 
and ofthemselveswithin a larger mar
ket/community, will have a tremen
dous advantage. It is, of course, pos
sible for us to do this on our own, to 
forge working relationships with folks 
from other departments, without the 
support of our home departments. But 
its very difficult. I didnt even know 
until my junior year that I could apply 
for a grant to make music. We couldnt 
get an art gallery off the ground until 
our senior year. Which leaves little 
time to develop these projects on a 
long-term basis. And if it were encour
aged, the success rate of CFA and 
H&SS graduates would most likely 
increase. As it is, we have the lowest 
earning potential of CMU graduates. 
We knew this when we decided on a 
major that is historically coupled with 
starvation. However, its a stereotype, 
and as we all know successful artists, 
actors, and musicians live extremely 
well. If you expect to starve, you will. If, 
as an artist, you have been taught to 
live in an ivory tower, with a classical 
but extremely narrow education, you 
have less of a chance at success than 
someone whos had contact with the 
rest of the world  business, history, 
computer training, design, etc. If our 
departments were able to make an ef
fort to expose us to each other, we would 
receive a more realistic education  
and wed tremble less at the thought of 
graduation day.

Valentines Day distorts love
Rebecca Fribush
Valentines Day, so the story goes, 
came about when the newly-Christian
ized Romans needed to come up with a 
way to justify the pagan festival of lust 
they were accustomed to having in midFebruary. So they slapped St. Valentines 
name on it, and its been making us 
miserable ever since. Anyone familiar 
with the holiday will not be surprised 
in the least that it has its origins with 
the same people whose idea of family 
entertainment was crowding into sta
diums to watch lions scarf down virile 
young men in togas.
But on our modern Valentines Day, 
we dont watch lions put their mouths all 
over virile young men  we watch the 
girlfriends, wives, and significant oth

are pitied by the participants.

Writer feels Leftist language duplicates Orwellian Newspeak
tr.U
How many 
folks have read 
1984 by George 
Orwell? I would 
hope everyone, James Stepanek but in these 
days of decaying
school systems, I cant be assured of this. Ill try to 
summarize the gist of this book for you folks, who 
have not read this classic. Its set in the future 
where a totalitarian socialist government main
tains power by manipulation of language and his
tory, as well as constant observation over its people.
In the book, a new version of English is intro
duced, called Newspeak. Its actually a rash of 
inherent contradictions.
The main examples are War is Peace, Free
dom is Slavery, and Ignorance is Strength. 
These are the mottos of the regime in power, and 
the eerie thing is that the mottos reflect the way 
the Left thinks today. Theyve turned language on
its head, and rewritten history in a perfectly 
Orwellian manner.
Each of the above phrases has in some way been 
adopted as a truism by the Left. Example: War is 
Peace  does this sound anything like the ship
ping of thousands of troops into the middle of a 
Balkan battlefield and calling it peacekeeping? 
How about Freedom is Slavery?
This reminds me of all the Leftists who berate 
the free market as wage slavery. Then of course 
we have Ignorance is Strength. Now this one 
really hits the mark, with such examples as Ebonics 
and Outcome-Based Education, both of which are 
about accepting ignorance as a form of strength. 
This reflects only a portion of the mangling of the 
language that theyve accomplished.
Note that I havent referred to these people as 
liberals, because that moniker is another casu
alty of political struggles. Liberals, as they always 
used to be, were people mostly concerned with 
freedom and individual liberty. Sadly enough, those
who now go by this appellation dont seem too 
concerned with freedom or peoples rights.
The complete disdain by people on the Left for 
the simple right to private property belies the 
label of liberal. Their espousal of socialist 
goals and objectives comes at the exclusion of 
individual freedom, and as such, they simply 
cant be called liberals.
A good example of this was when Dole called 
Clinton a liberal during one of the presidential 
debates. Clinton denied the claim, and for once, 
Clinton didnt lie. Of course, he didnt tell the whole 
truth either. By Doles (faulty) definition, Clinton 
may well be a liberal, but by a classical definition 
he certainly isnt.
Simply look at his utter disregard for civil liber
ties, private property, and individual privacy: e.g. 
his signing of the Communications Decency Act, 
his disregard for the Second Amendment, his 
support for illegal search and seizure in his 
Crime Act of 1993, and the current Department
of Justice opposition to private encryption.
To further the Orwellian analogy, one doesnt 
have to look much farther than Proposition 209, 
which passed last year in California. This was a 
state constitutional amendment that said that 
discrimination is wrong. Somehow, the Left de
cided that it was discriminatory and racist. Now if 
you need a better example of Newspeak than 
calling a proposition that outlaws discrimination 
racist, I think you have a problem.
While we did make it past 1984 without the 
horrors Orwell wrote about, I think one could make 
a case that the Left, which Orwell grew to deplore, 
has come to look much like the beast he described! 
I should think that the stark similarities which ar 
evident should be enough to make people think 
before they pull a voting lever in the future.

Columnist believes society ignores maltreated, victimized children
Vy Ty Mai
Eddie, a South Bronx boy featured in 
a new documentary entitled Green Trees, 
used to beg and steal money when he 
lived in South Bronx. He didnt do it for 
clothes. He didnt do it for food. He didnt 
even do it for fun. He did it for drugs. His 
fathers drugs. But the money always 
ran out and Eddie and his family were 
always homeless. It became a habit for 
Eddie, the life of the little crimes  a 
grab here, a lie there. It was survival. 
When he was put into a home, he 
couldnt visit his family because they 
didnt Have a home themselves, and 
they were busy getting high on life. 
But he still missed them.
Missed them to the point where he 
didnt care about the way he acted around 
People, didnt care that he mindlessly 
lashed out in a sort of deadened pain.
Can he be saved? Can they be saved?
Just like Eddie, we move mindlessly 
through our own personal microcosms 
hoping, believing, praying that chil
dren like Eddie do not exist. But this is 
not true.
Every day, people go about their lives 
without noticing the children. These 
small wonders float about our society, 
are nurtured by it, sheltered, educated, 
and sometimes, although we are ab
horred to admit it, abused by it.
Shall we count the ways in which the 
children are abused? Unfortunately, 
there are too many. They range from 
physical abuse to hunger to the influ
ences of the media. Severe to mild. In his 
book Child Abuse, Jim Hopper lists the 
types of Substantiated Maltreatment 
of children as neglect, physical abuse, 
sexual abuse, emotional maltreatment, 
and other/unknown. Out of approxi
mately one million cases documented by 
the United States Department of Health 
and Human Services that Hopper cites,
neglect is most prominent with over 50 
percent of those cases, with physical 
abuse at approximately 25 percent. And 
this is only in the United States alone.
The statistics go on and on, but they do 
not tell the story behind the victimiza
tions. The Child Abuse Man Story is the 
story of Paul McLaughlin and his oneman campaign against child abuse. 
Born and raised in the outskirts of Pitts
burgh, he was 23 years old when he 
could begin to tell his story of his abuse 
as a child. The abuse almost killed him 
twice and hospitalized him for 90 days. 
From this discovery onward, 
McLaughlin made it his mission to in
form the world of these horrible acts. 
Faced with ridicule and ignorance, he cam
paigned around the nation until finally 
people began to listen. Today, McLaughlin 
continues to tell his story in openforums and 
radio programs in the Northwest.
Paul McLaughlin was one of the lucky 
ones. He escaped the hell that was his 
abuse and found freedom in giving a
voice to his pain. But there are some out 
there among the unfortunate who can
not or will not give their pain a voice. In 
his report, Hopper adds a warning: Re
member, most cases of abuse and ne
glect are never even reported.
Adults violate their most sacred du
ties when they hurt or allow their chil
dren to be hurt. But these adults are not 
the only predator of children. Society 
itself can prove to be a huge factor in the 
loss of innocence.. Daily, infants, kids, 
teens, young adults, lose themselves in 
the black mire of social horrors.
The National Center for Missing and 
Exploited Children exists for the sole 
purpose of preventing crimes against 
children. They have a national database 
and tracking system to trace abducted 
children. Their reports involve at
tempted abductions, abductions, chil
dren who run away, children who are 
thrown away, and children who are lost, 
injured, or otherwise missing.
And the list goes on. Teen pregnancy
rates are up, according to Campaign For 
Our Children, a supportive program for 
teenage mothers. Inner-city crime com
mitted by youths are out there on our 
streets. Hungry children the world over 
are crying for relief. Drugs and violence 
run rampant in our schools and on our 
television sets. Babies will grow up to 
suffer because of their mothers pre
natal neglect.
What does all this mean? It means 
that our children are suffering. The fu
ture is being snuffed out and dying right 
before our eyes. The world in which 
Eddie lives is real, and it is not a king
dom of riches.
Instead, it is a kingdom where chil
dren are hurt every minute, and ounce 
by ounce, their innocence drains out of 
them. The innocents are dying.
And can they be saved?

Pro teens not all good
TEENS, from page 13
Capriati, who went from being the Oil of 
Olay poster girl to being caught shoplift
ing and in possession of marijuana, all 
before her 18th birthday. Capriati took 
some time off from the game and is now 
attempting to regain the form that made 
her a top-ten player, crowd favorite, and 
Olympic Champion earlier this decade, 
but that has yet to happen. More re
cently, the 19-year-old figure skater 
Oksana Baiul, an Olympic gold medal
ist, was caught driving a car nearly 100 
miles per hour while also being legally 
drunk. These two instances are not in
dicative of all teenage athletes by any 
stretch of the imagination, but they do 
suggest that it is important that some
body close to the athletes be reminded 
that they are only kids in reality and do 
need some handling.
A bigger problem, in my mind, is what 
happens when kids want to emulate their 
heroes. There was a time when wanting 
to be your favorite basketball player 
meant refining your jump shot and try
ing to attract college coaches to your high 
school to try to get a scholarship to a wellknown university. Now with the success 
of Bryant and Garnett, the question of 
students foregoing their education at an 
early age in order to prepare themselves 
for an NBA career becomes valid for 
junior-high kids across the country.
Baseball and hockey have had their 
system in place for years, but you do not 
hear many tragic stories about peoples
lives being demolished because of their 
dream to be a baseball player. But it 
must also be noted that the demograph
ics being dealt with in the case of a sport 
like basketball are much different than 
in any of the sports previously men
tioned. Hockey, tennis, and gymnastics 
have been almost exclusively the sports 
of an elite class of people who are able to 
afford participation. Baseball is more 
urban than those three, but it never has 
reached the popularity in the cities that 
basketball now has.
The current situation is that people 
who could use a decent education in 
order to escape the vicious cycles of 
poverty and crime may instead be chas
ing an impossible dream of becoming a 
pro athlete. And if you think that I am 
just describing a common stereotype, I 
suggest you rent the movie Hoop 
Dreams and see how you feel as two 
young aspiring athletes watch their 
hopes be shattered.
Teenage athletes are becoming more 
and more successful in both team and 
individual sports. But as their success 
increases, the questions surrounding 
them do also. Whether they can handle 
the pressure that come with being a 
multi-millionaire is not what concerns 
me. What concerns me is what happens 
to those who put everything they have 
into an effort to be just like these ath
letes, and end up with nothing.

NHL trade deadline looms
From the Point
By Jason Andracki
Two marquee players have 
changed hands in recent weeks 
for players that are less than 
marquee caliber. With the March 
trading deadline approaching, 
this is probably a preview of 
things to come.
In a move that was anything 
but a surprise j Ed Belfour was 
traded by the Blackhawks 
to the Sharks for Chris 
Terreri, Ulf Dahlen,
Michal Sykora, and a 
conditional pick in the 
1997 draft. With Eddie 
the Eagle gone now and 
Jeremy Roenick in Phoe
nix, that leaves Chris 
Chelios as the franchise 
player in the windy city.
The Sharks get a proven 
winner in net, something 
they have yet to have in 
their seven year history and
the Blackhawks get a trio of role 
players. Terreri is a great backup 
for Jeff Hackett, and Sykora com
pliments the already deep blueline. Dahlen is past his prime but 
will still net a few key goals come 
playoff time. Even before Belfour 
went done with a knee injury, 
Chicago won this trade, since they 
were probably going to lose him 
to free-agency at the end of this 
season anyway.
The next marquee name s witching uniforms was Tomas 
Sandstrom, who now joins the 
European laden Red Wings. In 
return the Penguins received for
ward Greg Johnson. This was 
obviously a paycheckcutting move. Sandstrom has 
never really recovered form an 
injury that cut his 95-96 season 
short, a year in which he was on 
par for 50 goals. Johnson never 
really found his niche in Detroit, 
and its doubtful that hell find it 
on a team where Stu Barnes, 
Andreas Johannsson, and Glen 
Murray are already fighting for 
ice time. Sandstroms age and 
Johnsons inexperience make this 
trade even.
With the playoffs approaching, 
more teams are going to be shak
ing up their rosters. At least a 
few big money players will be 
changing colors. Doug Gilmour of 
the Toronto Maple Leafs and the 
Vancouver Canucks Alexander 
Mogilny top the list of those waiting to be moved. Vincent 
Damphousse is the captain in 
Montreal, so you can always count 
on that player to be trade bait. 
Watch for the New Jersey Devils, 
Buffalo Sabres, Edmonton Oiler,
press conference on Wednesday 
afternoon. Three weeks ago, they 
chose Lalime as their featured 
interviewee. Whatever he said 
then is not relevant now, the in
formation has all been made very 
public. But it was the way that he 
said it. He was in awe. After the 
presenter gave the run down of 
his recent records and accolades, 
the questions poured in.
In his heavily French-Canadian English (Lalime was born in

Tartans win Brandis rematch
By CHRIS CANNON
Tartan Sports Editor
We felt we could pressure them 
and cause turnovers, head coach 
Gerri Seidl said of the womens bas
ketball team, which forced 22 turn
overs in a 61-44 win over Brandeis 
Friday night.
We play [defense] according to who 
were playing, Seidl said of the strat
egy to plan man-to-man the entire game.
We were hoping to [blow them out]; 
we lost there earlier, senior Kelly 
Gaitens said of the lop-sided win. We 
wanted to come out and win by a good 
margin to show that the last time was 
a fluke.
Gaitens has moved into the starting 
lineup in place of senior Penny Davis, 
who tore her anterior cruciate ligament 
(ACL) against Washington University
Brian Smith/Tartan Photo Staff 
Amanda Tishkoff drives towards the hoop Friday night.
January 31. Gaitens led the team, with 
seven rebounds.
Its forcing other people to step up 
and its rounding out our game, senior 
Becky McCadney said of playing with
out Davis in the lineup.
The team has been recovering from 
other injuries as well. Freshman Kristy 
Thomas tore her ACL earlier in the year.
It was one of those plays where the 
clock was counting down and she was 
driving to the hoop and her knee just 
gave out on her, McCadney said, de
scribing the play Thomas was injured 
on. Junior Jackie Autieri also has a 
badly sprained ankle.
Brandeis stayed with the Tartans 
early, holding on at 8-12 and 11-15 
before CMU used a 15-6 run over the 
last eight minutes of the first half to 
break the game open.
Led by freshman Sam Majemik, the 
bench outscored the 
starters 32-29, includ
ing 21 after the break.
Sams real nice com
ing off the bench, said 
Seidl. Shes a player. 
I prefer coming off 
the bench to starting, 
said Majemik, whose 
only miss of the night 
was a three-pointer. I 
thought we played re
ally well. Compared to 
the last time we played 
them, it was a com
plete 180.
The team put up 16 
three-point shots, over 
a quarter of their total 
shots.
They were giving 
us that shot so we 
were taking it, said 
freshman starting
guard Lacey Perretta.
They were in a zone, it pulls the 
defense out, Gaitens said. It opens up 
the inside game.
Once the inside was open, the Tartans 
pounded the ball inside. Majemik and 
starting center Katie OLeary each scored 
six of their team-leading 10 points on 
inside feeds in the first half.
The Judges stayed close to start the 
second half, but a jumper by Majemik 
with one second left on the shot clock 
brought out a Brandeis timeout with 15:34 
left in the game. Tracy Coalter sunk a 
three-pointer on CMUs next possession 
before Brandeis rattled off six straight 
points to force the Tartans into a timeout.
I think our defense broke down a little 
bit, said Seidl, as Brandeis found their 
way to the hoop easier in the secondhalf. 
Coalter hit her third of three shots be
hind the arc after the timeout and after 
another CMU basket, a spinning half 
hook by Majernik, gave the Tartans their 
largest lead at 48-26 with 8:00 remain
ing. Soon after, the Tartans emptied 
their bench.
Senior Kristen Kupfer led the team 
with five steals, and junior Marcelle 
Steele dished out seven assists.
We didnt play as well as we could 
have last game. So we wanted to prove to 
ourselves that we deserved to win this 
game, Perretta said.
The game was a substantial contrast 
to the Tartans last contest, a 79-77 
quadruple overtime victory over Chi
cago last Sunday. Lasting over three 
hours, the contest tied an NCAA Divi
sion III womens basketball record and 
set a University Athletic Assoication 
record for the longest game ever.
We were hoping we wouldnt have to 
go into a lot of overtimes; the other 
[game] was just an exception, this was 
the norm, said Gaitens.
Mario gets 600th
MARIO, from page 14
Pittsburgh was having a difficult times 
coming up with anything. They were 
being called offside every time they at
tempted to penetrate the zone. But it 
was center Ron Francis who finally put 
them ahead for good in this game. The 
lead was there.
Now Lemieux, looking like it was time, 
sent the puck home into the empty net to 
seal his record; becoming the seventh 
player to score 600 and only one of three 
active. His list of team and NHL records 
is a mile long. He has the highest career 
goals/game percentage
pected occurrence, he had not skated as 
many shifts as a usual night it seemed.
When he came around the comer, I 
realized again how human our heroes 
are up close. Lemieux looks like a mon
ster on skates, towering above many of 
his opponents. Reverently, the crowd of 
reporters parted for him to walk to his 
locker and waited for him to be ready to 
answer questions. He did, in a shy voice. 
The veterans had told me to get up as close 
as possible to recordhis remarks, he speaks 
in an almost inaudible, hushed tone.
He was happy about scoring the bench(.834), the league mark for The big boys all have theirmost overtime goals and *
points (nine and 19 respec- days. This would be one of
tively), and currently has the a
third highest +/- rating in IVISI'IO S l3St, 
the entire league (+26 
through Tuesday). Who
knows what could have happened had 
he not been hindered by Hodgkins Dis
ease and back ailments.
The crowd went to its feet, the pre
recorded tape profiling all of Lemieuxs 
shining moments ran and the camera 
caught big Marios silent smile and quiet 
appreciation. The journalists mean
while, knowing that the game was over, 
streamed towards the locker room. The 
wanted to talk with the player who would 
be the number one star of the night, and 
everyone wanted to be first.
After waiting for about twenty min
utes in the Pen locker room, staking out 
Lemieuxs wooden locker while the rest 
of the team got dressed and ready to fly 
right out to Montreal that night, time 
was the mystery. Vice President of Com
munications, Tom Mcmillan, came out 
and informed the group that Lemieux 
would not be making the trip, that his 
back was giving him problems. We 
scribbled away, denoting this not-unexmark in front of the home town crowd, 
they deserved to see it. But for the man 
who gets standing ovations in no matter 
what rink he plays, accolades tend to 
lose their feel. He looked tired and 
slightly pained, speaking for awhile and 
then silently moving away. The report
ers understood.
This was the only reason why most 
have them had come down, while Jagr 
and Francis lolled in the background 
barely spoken to by anyone. Jagr, who a 
month ago scored his 600th point, has 
many years ahead of him. Hes only 25. 
Francis has seen it all before, the vet is 
33 years old and is 8th all-time in as
sists, with over 1,300 points in an NHL 
career of over 1130 games. The big boys 
all have their days. This would be one of 
Marios last.
The radio announcer on the way home 
said to save your ticket stubs if you had 
gone and added that press passes were 
priceless.

Tartans take two weekend wins

great night because the team won.
The guys on the floor felt like we were going 
to win, even when they tied it up, said 
Shaunnessey, who contributed 12 points. 
Tommy hit that big three.
CMU won despite being out-shot in at
tempts (72-62) and percentage (including 
52 percent to 41 percent margin in the sec
ond half).
We got killed on the boards, said Praesel, 
a sophomore.
Senior Gary Trendel, who poured in 39 
points and collected 22 rebounds in the Tar
tans last two games, led the team with 12 
rebounds.
Theres two parts to rebounding, Wingen 
said.
One, you gotta find a man, and two, you 
gotta go to the ball, Trendel said.
Operating out of a 2-3 zone almost the 
entire game, CMU often had problems boxing 
out. When they did box out, the team left lanes 
open for Brandeis players and didnt pursue 
the ball.
You cant just watch the ball, you gotta go 
get it, said Trendel.
CMU was outrebounded 53-39, including 
25-22 on their own defensive glass.
Sophomore backup center Dan Bowersox, 
out with a dislocated left shoulder, was sorely 
missed on the boards when Trendel was out of 
the game.
Im out at least three more games, 
Bowersox said. It felt better already, so hope
fully I will be back soon.
CMUs pressure defen 
the team lacked in 
other areas.
Coach wanted a 
more aggressive 
press, said Praesel.
When [Brandeiss 
point guard] was out of 
the game we knew we 
could press them.
We wanted to push 
the pressure on them 
tonight, said Wingen.
No one applied more 
pressure than Bodnar, 
whose seven steals 
were complimented by 
seven rebounds and six 
assists.
Ive been here for 
four years and this is 
my favorite Ive been 
on, Bodnar said of his 
career at CMU.
The last CMU player 
to score 1,000 career 
points was Kevin 
Byrne, the teams lead
ing scorer for the last 
two years. According to
coach Wingen, Byrne finished fourth all-time 
in scoring for CMU.
Thats one of those milestones in sports that

Teen trouble exists in pro sports
Life's a Sport
Ronak Singhal
The emergence of successful 
teenage athletes at the highest 
level of competition has sparked 
much debate. Last month, 16- 
year old Martina Hingis of Swit
zerland became the youngest 
Grand Slam singles champion of 
the current era when she cap
tured the Australian Open 
womens singles title. In the past 
two years, three basketball play
ers  Kevin Garnett, Kobe 
Bryant, and Jermaine ONeal  
have foregone their entire college 
careers and headed straight to 
the NBA from high school. And 
this past summer, the athletes 
who received the most media cov
erage at the Summer Olympics 
were a band of pixies (and I do not 
mean Frank Blacks band).
People argue whether it is 
healthy for them to take on the 
stress and demands of being full
time athletes. It is also disputed 
whether it is right for our culture 
to put so much emphasis on sports 
at such a young age.
A key sport in the youth move
ment is womens gymnastics. 
From the Russian Olga Korbut of 
the 1972 Olympics, through 
Nadia Comenici and Mary Lou 
Retton, the sport has featured 
extremely flexible teenagers per
forming incredible gymnastic 
feats. This year was no different
as a band of American girls won 
the all-around gold medal in gym
nastics. Kerrie Strug, now a fresh
man at UCLA, went on to win the 
hearts of America by completing 
a final vault even though she had 
been hobbled by an injured ankle.
It was Strugs vault that 
brought to the forefront the ques
tion of how much pressure is 
placed on these young athletes. 
Bela Karolyi, maybe the most 
influential coachin the sport, was 
yelling at her, You can do it! 
before that final vault even 
though she was clearly injured. 
Some people say Strugs leap was 
too risky for her because she could 
have severely injured herself. To 
me, though, her vault was just 
another athlete trying as hard as 
possible to win. It was not a case 
of a tiny, little girl being exploited 
by puppeteers for their own glory; 
instead, it was just someone try
ing to bring the team a victory.
While this type of controversy 
is old to other professional sports, 
its new to basketball. It used to 
be rare for players other than 
college seniors to be drafted into 
the NBA. Occasionally a remark
able underclassman (Magic 
Johnson, Isiah Thomas, Michael 
Jordan, etc.) would apply for the 
draft, but it was not common
place. Then something changed, 
and college players of all ages 
started applying for the draft. 
Now players of all ages seem to be 
applying for the draft, ranging 
from the usual seniors in college 
to the very unusual seniors in 
high school.
When Kevin Garnett was 
drafted straight out of high school 
by the Minnesota Timberwolves 
two years ago, kids across the 
nation started wondering if they 
too could live out their NBA dream 
without wasting time in col
lege. Many people hoped that 
Garnett would fail in the NBA so 
that people could use him as an 
example of why players should 
stay in college. Unfortunately for 
his detractors, Garnett has 
quickly turned into one of the 
brightest young stars in the game 
and was just named to his first 
all-star team.
So now people are lamenting 
the fact that athletes are skip
ping their college education for 
an opportunity to play profes
sional sports. Again though, this 
is not a new occurrence. Hockey 
and baseball players have been 
drafted straight out of high school 
for years now. The major differ
ence here, however, is that in 
both hockey and baseball the 
majority of players out of high 
school are not thrown directly 
into the fire of the major leagues. 
Instead most players spend time 
learning the game and maturing 
in the minor leagues. Yes, there 
are those exceptional players in 
both sports that can directly go to
Tony Yu/Tartan Art Staff
the big leagues at the age of 18, 
but they are few and far between. 
The college game has long served ; 
as the minor leagues for both ; 
football and basketball, and now ; 
those few exceptional athletes ' 
who do not believe they need to ; 
spend time honing their skills | 
take a gamble by going straight ; 
to the NBA.
There are major problems that ; 
are perceived about having teen- ; 
agers be successful athletes, in
volving both the young profes
sionals themselves and also con
cerning those who aspire to be | 
like them. It is sometimes thought j 
that since the youngsters are now | 
professionals playing with people ] 
sometimes twice their age, they ' 
are mature and responsible | 
enough to manage their lives. This : 
is sometimes true, but it is also  
true that when left unattended 
these athletes end up finding 
themselves in a mess of trouble.
One vivid example of this was  
womens tennis player Jennifer

Men edge out NYU by a point
By RYAN SCHILLING
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Going into the game, we felt 
like one thing we had to do was 
8low NYU down, and I think for 
the most part we did that. said 
Tony Wingen, head coach of the 
CMU mens basketball, team.
Indeed they did, as they con
trolled the tempo of the close 71- 
70 victory for the Tartans over
so many times, said Andy Sofish, 
starting forward for the Tartans, 
who had a good second half scor
ing 12 points including some 
clutch shots late in the game.
The team dominated the boards 
with 46 rebounds to the Violets 
29. Especially important were the 
offensive rebounds, giving the 
team many second chances.
With 18 seconds on the clock 
Rich Bodnar gave CMU a three
Rebounding was the biggest thing.  
 Andy Sofish, junior guard
the New York University Violets. 
The team kept it close through
out the first half going to the 
break down 35-34. They then 
pened the second period stop
ping NYU from playing their fastbreak game and forcing them to 
take their time with the ball.
Rebounding was the biggest 
thing. We held them to one shot
point lead by converting one of his 
two free throws. NYU had a chance 
to win, however. The Tartan de
fense played very tightly, not al
lowing much penetration near the 
goal. Finally, NYU attempted a 
three-point shot which was no 
good. They got the offensive re
bound, and took another shot 
which also was errant. Off the
rebound from that shot, a Tartan 
fouled a Violet player who went to 
the line with one second remain
ing in the game. He hit the first 
free throw making the score 71- 
69. Intuition would say to miss 
the second shot to have a chance 
at a two-pointer to tie the game. 
He instead made the final free 
throw, and that was the game.
What goes around comes 
around, said Tommy Praesel, 
starting guard for the Tartans 
regarding their free throw shoot
ing Sunday. The shots off of fouls 
which had been their Achilles 
heel as of late was exceptionally 
good. They made 1622 (.727) 
from the line in undays game 
while the Violets were a modest 
10-19 (.526).
Gary Trendel, starting center, 
had a more general key to victory 
for the team. I think, though, 
that a lot of it was confidence, 
Trendel said. We went in there 
and knew we could win.

SPORTS
Club dumps division leader
By JESSICA STRELITZ
Tartan Senior Staffwriter
Carnegie Mellon ice hockey has un
dergone dramatic changes in the past 
week. Saturday night at home against 
first place Allegheny College seemed 
an inopportune time to be missing two 
of their top players, seniors Jim Buck 
and Chris Adukaitis.
It just means that more people have 
to help out who werent helping out 
before, said junior starting forward 
Scott Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald, with two 
goals, and his linemates, senior Ray 
Ardire (two goal, three assists) and 
grad-student Roger Maddalena (two 
assists), stuck to those words in roll
ing the Tartans to a 4-1 win.
But there were three lines playing 
Saturday and each one put in their 
toughest licks. Coach Fred Maddalena 
complimented the defense as well.
We played excellent D, including 
the forwards. Defense got a lot of 
-shots on net and kept the puck in,
said Maddalena.
This was apparent on CMUs first 
goal in the middle of the first period. 
Early in the play, Fitzgerald foiled a 
breakaway attempt by Allegheny and 
sent it to graduate student Blair 
Echols. Clearing the zone, Echols sent 
the puck far up ice to Ardire. His shot 
deflected, and the rebound came to 
Fitzgerald, who had hustled up ice 
and planted himself in front of the net. 
Fitzgerald scored and the exhilarated 
CMU squad went up an early 1-0.
Allegheny jumped out early to tie it 
in the second, but CMU still show
cased their talent for hard hitting and 
beautiful passing. The second line of 
freshman PJ Grzywacz and seniors 
Relja Ivanovic and Anthony Paul com
bined to score 30 seconds after the 
Allegheny goal. Ivanovics hand pass 
dropped the puck in front of the net, 
allowing Grzywacz to snipe it in. But 
as soon as it went up, it was called 
back on account of the hand pass. So

Bodnar scores 1000th point, men take two in UAA
By CHRIS CANNON
Tartan Sports Editor
Its sorta like a monkey off the 
back, Rich Bodnar said of scor
ing his 1000th career point in 
CMUs 76-73 victory over 
Brandeis last Friday. I knew how 
many points coming in. 
Bodnar had a great game to
night. Hes shooting the ball bet
ter and setting up his team
mates, said mens basketball 
head coach Tony Wingen. Thats 
tremendous, thats what you need 
from your senior captain.
Be a player, get out there and 
make plays, said Wingen. Rich 
Bodnars a player.
Bodnars 1000th point came 
with 16:11 left in the second half. 
The senior score eight of the Tar
tans first ten points in the half. 
He had 17 in the game and cur
rently sits at 1006.
I get into it a little bit, junior 
Colin Shaunnessey said of his
unbridled enthusiasm during the 
game. We believed we were go
ing to win, that was the differ
ence.
Thats essential, Wingen said 
of the teams belief in itself. I 
thought that LaDale Widmeyer 
played as well as hes played all 
season. [In the] second half, he 
ran the show for us.
It was a good thing ... to beat 
somebody twice in our confer
ence, said Widmeyer, a junior.
CMU started off slowly, look
ing out of sync and scoring its 
first six points off two Tommy 
Praesel three-pointers. The team 
would not trail again, though 
Brandeis was able to tie the score 
four more times in the game.
The Tartans went to the bench 
early and often, rotating in fresh 
players to pressure the Brandeis 
ball-handlers.
Brandeis tied the game at 55 
with 9:49 remaining before CMU 
went off. Praesel hit his third
three of the game and senior Gary 
Trendel was fouled underneath 
positioning for the rebound. He 
hit one freethrow and another 
basket their next time down made 
Brandeis call a timeout with the 
Tartans leading 61-55.
CMU came out pressing. On 
their next possession, Bodnar 
drove and dished to Trendel for 
an easy two. A Widmeyer steal 
and finish kept Brandeis on their 
heels. The Tartans scored thennext time down, and another 
Trendel free throw gave CMU 
their biggest lead, 68-55, with 
5:14 remaining.
The team looked out of sync as 
Brandeis rattled off the next eight 
points. With the team struggling, 
Bodnar found himself alone be
hind the three-point line.
I felt a little bit off tonight, he 
said. The defense sagged off and 
I took it.
The shot, Bodnars only make 
of eight in the game proved big.
It was definitely an ugly game, 
Wingen said, as Brandeis could 
not be held down. The Judges 
tied the game at 71, less than 
three minutes after the Tartans 
enjoyed their big advantage, with 
eight more straight points. They 
had the opportunity to take the 
lead, but the teams point guard 
missed the front end of a oneand-one freethrow.
Bodnar missed CMUs next 
shot, but stole the ball from the 
rebounder. He passed to Trendel, 
who found Praesel behind the 
arc. Praesel showed no hesita
tion in draining his fourth three 
(on four attempts).
Hes a three-point shooter, hes 
been doing that pretty much all 
year, said Wingen on Praesel. 
When hes open, we want him to 
shoot it.
Just contributing, Praesel 
said of his shot, which would be 
the game-winner. I consider it a

Senior Rich Bodnar scored his 1000th point Friday night.
Patrick Lalime, the rookie goaltender from the Pitts
burgh Penguins, is busy. He was profiled in Sports 
Illustrated. On January 15, he set an NHL rookie 
record by making 16 consecutive starts without a 
loss. He set a team record for most saves at home 
with 49 saves on January 21, the same night 
that he set the Penguins team record for long
est unbeaten streak.
He leads the league (as of the first week of 
February) in goals-against-average (2.11) and 
save percentage (.935). He was named NHL 
Rookie of the Month, back-to-back, in De
cember 96 and in January 97, the first 
player to do so since Niklas Lidstrom in 
91-92. Phew!
Records aside, it was being named NHL 
Player of the Week for the period of Janu
ary 13-19, that caught the attention of 
the sports writer s. They wanted to know 
more about this 22-year old phenom who 
had the pulse of Pittsburgh fans in his 
veins. Why were so many women packing 
the stands behind the goal cage just to 
catch a glimpse of his face when he lifted 
his helmet to drink from his water bottle 
between plays? Hey, we take what we 
can get, they crooned as they crowded 
along the banisters to watch him tromp 
into the locker room.
It is the goalie mystique. There are a 
lot of handsome men in hockey, if you 
dont mind broken noses, constant cuts 
and bruises, and hulking shoulders and 
arms. But goalies are different in every 
way. They dress differently, from their 
pads to their customized helmets. They 
are big eccentrics with wild tempers or 
tres cool demeanors. And lots of media 
attention goes to any rookies head, goalie 
or otherwise. It was time to test Patrick

Highly ranked NYU downs Tartans

Tartan Junior Staffwriter
The CMU womens basketball 
team suffered a tough loss Sunday 
afternoon to the Violets of New York 
University. The final score was 53- 
34.
NYUs ranked second in the na
tion for a reason, said head coach, 
Gerri Seidl. And this is according to 
which poll you subscribe to. The 
Columbus Multimedia Poll, one of 
the more credible ones for Division 
III basketball, has NYU ranked num
ber one.
At the beginning of the game it 
began to look like a rout as the Vio
lets, with eight minutes left in the 
first period, led the Tartans by a 
score of 28-4. They totally took us 
out of our offense, said starting for
ward Kristen Kupfer, a senior. How
ever, after this point, the CMU de
fense really applied the pressure 
and NYU did not score again until
Senior Kelly Gaitens fights off a Brandeis player, the final minute when they added a
couple more points. But still the Violets 
led at the break 3011.
I told them at the half, we werent 
playing the game,  and the officials, 
werent calling anything. So if they were 
to step up and play more aggressively, 
we could get back in it, continued Coach 
Seidl. And that is what they did.
The Tartan offense was productive 
and the defense would not be denied as 
they opened the second half with 
impressive 16-7 run. We got stronger 
and more determined to control the ball, 
Katie OLeary, the starting center, said 
of the run.
But then the Violets showed why they 
were ranked number two (or one). They 
completely stopped CMUs momentum 
with a 12-2 run. This shut down the 
Tartans and for the remainder of the 
game the two teams went back and forth 
scoring about the same amount of timesThe Violets suffered their first loss of 
the season last Friday night against 
Emory, so CMU might have felt the 
wrath of that. We didnt want the gantf

just starting out, its a pretty big deal. 
The major leagues, free catered dinner, 
packets of stats at your fingertips. A 
special press door and a seat far above 
the ice. The best seats in the house, no 
obstruction. And a capacity crowd full 
of expectations.
On Tuesday, February 4, Lemieux 
was to score his 600th goal at a home 
game against the Vancouver Canucks. 
It was especially important because this, 
being his self-proclaimed last season, is 
a very special one. He has seen his team 
make a spectacular run since the sixplayer acquisition in mid-November 
(Pens took Darius Kasparaitis and 
Andreas Johansson from the Islanders, 
Stu Barnes and Jason Wooley from the 
Panthers, and Fredrik Olausson and 
Alex Hicks from the Mighty Ducks).
The game itself had a feeling of an
ticipation. It was obvious that every
one was trying to get Lemieux the 
puck, especially Jagr who dug hard to 
control the disk to his linemate. On his 
first try Lemieux broke his stick over 
the Vancouver cage and had to throw it 
in, over Canucks goaltender Kirk 
McLeans head, and skate back up ice. 
Frustration. Everyone was 
him, scrutinizing even more 
usual. They would cheer his 
chanting so that from the top 
Civic Arena, the place 
from their deafening 
wanted their man, their 
franchise to score.
But the expectation of Lemieux hav

Filmmaker explores 
personal history
By ALEX LEWIN
Tartan Forum Co-editor
Tony Buba is a filmmaker strongly influenced by heritagehis own and 
that of African Americans. Born in Braddock, PA, Buba, 53, began making 
films in the early 70s as a graduate student at Ohio University. Many of 
them are short, documentary-style pieces on the Braddock/Pittsburgh 
region, and the influence of the steel industry.
His latest film, Struggles in Steel: A Story of African American Steel 
Workers, chronicles the experience of African Americans in the steel mills 
from the time they migrated north in the late 19th century to the massive 
lay-offs that began in the early 80s. Made up primarily of interviews with 
ex-steel workers, Struggles documents the racism, poverty, and intolerance 
that pervaded the African American experience in the mills.
Its a bit of history that wasnt covered at all, says Buba, who began 
working on the film in 1990, when his collaborator, ex-steel worker Ray 
Henderson, suggested the idea.
Bubas exploration of the African- American experience contin
ues in his next project, a feature-length 
film entitled Conversations on a Bus,
Half fiction, half documentary,
Conversations is abouthow white 
people act and speak about Afri
can-Americans behind the backs 
of African-Americans. Buba 
thinks the film reflects the 
change in Braddocks African 
American population, which he 
estimates as 50/50 today, while 
it was closer to 25 percent Afri
can American, 75 percent Cauca
sian 15 years ago.

Students modeled native clothing as well as innovative designs at 
last Saturdays Lunar Gala '97, a celebration of Chinese New Year.
By ANDREW WANG
Tartan Staffwriter
Traditionally, Chinese New Year is a time of great celebra
tion, where people get together with their friends and family 
for exciting festivities to welcome the lunar New Year. Since 
some Asian students at CMU are away from home and 
inundated with the stressful grind of academic study and 
work, they faced this difficulty by creating the Lunar Gals 
Fashion Show and Dance. By doing this, they merged the 
parallel aspects of their cultural heritage with the aspects ol 
modern day life in Pittsburgh.
This years Chinese New Year was last Friday, ushering in the 
Year of the Ox, according to the Chinese Zodiac. Nearly foui 
hundred people celebrated by attending the Lunar Gala 97 helc 
on the first floor of CFA this past Saturday night.
In the traditional celebration, people make loud noises anc 
set off firecrackers to scare away ghosts. All children wist 
their parents and other elders in their family good fortune 
and are rewarded with red envelopes filled with money 
People wear new and beautiful clothing to celebrate gooc 
fortune and prosperity.
Though no firecrackers were set off at the Lunar Gala 97, the 
fashion show celebrated prosperity by featuring a variety ol 
beautiful clothing, ranging from traditional Asian apparel, tc 
fashions from Victorias Secret and innovative designs for 1997 
The show also celebrated happiness by including an a capella 
musical performance, a hip-hop dance performance, a fashior 
contest, and a drawing of prizes for members of the audience 
The floor opened up for dancing following the show.
Six months ago, I never thought the Lunar Gala woulc 
actually happen. It was a dream to bring together the city 05 
Pittsburgh to celebrate this special holiday in the Easterr 
culture, said junior industrial management major Jimmy Chang 
the producer of the Lunar Gala. I missed my childhood years ir 
Taiwan when I would light firecrackers and receive many re( 
envelopes from family and relatives. I wanted to bring thi 
festivity and excitement of this holiday to Pittsburgh and creati

For some, Judaism is a religion. For

there is one aspect of Judaism that 
everyone shares  cultural heritage.
February marks Jewish 
Awareness Month (JAM), and 
Hillel, the Foundation for Jew

month of programs planned to 
educate and entertain those in
terested in Jewish history and 
culture.

thing like [the discussion], then we 
have a rabbi and teacher coming to our
chicken soup program, and then theres 
[a social activity] like cosmic bowling, 
said Rabbi Art Donsky, executive direc
tor of Hillel. We really do try to make it 
a smorgasbord of activities.
When planning the activities, Anapolle 
and other students thought about bring

because America has for so long 
fought against it. 
 Rabbi Art Donsky;

Jewish Awareness Month gives a title

Judaism and cultural Judaism. Jewish 
Awareness Month is a way for students to

compare Jewish Awareness Month in 
many ways to Black History Month in 
that it gives [students] a chance to really

Skibo Coffeehouse restructures for more business
By ANNE RAY
Tartan Assistant Features Editor
'The biggest slide rule on campus, a buggy from 
yS'ars gone by, sandwiches made-to-order, hot soup 
in a bread boule  these are just some of the 
changes that Skibo Coffeehouse has been making 
ttf the decor and menu to help its atmosphere. The 
staff hopes that the new decorations and improved 
food quality will help Skibo build a reputation to 
keep it in business.
If we could only just start over from last semes
ter, said Skibo Manager Roberta Rigano, a senior 
chemistry and biology major. It just leaves a bad 
taste in my mouth.
During the fall semester, Skibo was plagued by 
complaints from people who didnt like the lighting 
or the bare walls to those who demanded better 
food and quicker service.
Skibo employee Marc Gabriele, a senior IDS 
major, has worked in Skibo since the first 
semester of his freshman year. He said that 
some of Skibos problems stem from the con
stant change that the coffeehouse has under
gone for many years. Its location changed from 
the old Skibo, to the basement of Morewood 
Gardens, and now to its newest and hopefully 
permanent location on the second floor of the 
University Center.
There arent that many of the other staff 
that take the place seriously, said Gabriele. 
Theres been no real sense of continuity. Since 
the management [changed] every time we 
[moved], theres been very little of the same 
people working here.
The wait staff is one of the main complaints that

The coffeehouse has also expanded its menu and improved its service to bring in new clientele.
patrons of Skibo raised after last semester. The 
staff at Skibo have been making efforts to improve 
the service so it seems more like a restaurant. 
Shirts embroidered with the Skibo logo make the 
staff stand out.
This semester service is still slow, said sopho
more math major Bizzy Herbolsheimer. But you 
can get the waitresses because you actually know 
who they are.
Other complaints about the coffeehouse include
the furniture and the lighting. The plush leather 
chairs and coffee table that sat in one corner were 
replaced by a high table and stools. Some students 
complained that the lighting is too bright, while 
others like the bright natural lighting that the 
rooms large windows allow.
Sophomore chemistry/creative writing major 
Emily Slaby said that the decor was improving but 
still had some flaws.
I like the banners, but I dont like the flags
because they break up the natural lines of the 
room, Slaby said. I like that theyre trying to make 
a CMU-pride atmosphere. It makes you remember 
the enthusiasm for some of the big events.
Skibo manager John Paul, a junior mechanical 
engineering/engineering and public policy major, 
said that the staff solicited many clubs and organi
zations for memorabilia to decorate the walls. They 
would like to add to the decorations to include 
anything related to CMU-affiliated projects. He 
said that any free-standing objects, plaques, tshirts, banners, or other paraphernalia are wel
come. Already proposed to Skibo by different groups 
are copies of old publications, a kayak, a mural for 
the wall by the bar, and a rotating student art 
exhibit run by CFA.
We want to get the word out on campus that we 
want this to be their place, said Paul. We want to 
cover the walls from floor to ceiling with things 
that represent the campus.
Skibo is also planning to expand its range of 
special events. Entertainment, like the Jag
uar Mouth monthly poetry readings and regu
lar bands such as the jazz group 29 and the 
Yard Dogs, are helping to bring more people 
into the coffeehouse. One new idea soon to 
begin is the Fast Break free breakfasts, which 
will be for different colleges or groups each 
day of the week.
After the fall semester, in terms of financial 
issues, Skibo is in danger of not being able , to 
remain open.
The first semester we lost a tremendous amount 
of money, said Gabriele. We really had to fight to 
keep the place open. Once ... [Skibo Coffeehouse] 
stops getting tweaked with, itll settle down.

BUBA, from LI
Pittsburgher. He has lived in 
Braddock all his life. Braddock was 
a steel town before the mills began 
closing in the late 70s and early 
80s. With the decline in the steel 
industry, the town began to decay
 stores closed, money was lost, 
houses werent kept up, people 
started to leave.
Buba has witnessed and docu
mented much of this. The area is 
really rich with material, he says. 
Buba recalls coming home on week
ends and vacations while in college 
and seeing the ways in which the 
town transformed. Its like youre 
with your folks all the time and you 
dont see them age. But if youre 
gone for a year or two, come back, 
all of a sudden they look older. 
Thats what happened with the 
town; it really looked old.... I 
thought, well geez, I should docu
ment this before its all gone.
He began his career with short 
films about people within Braddock. 
Characters, he calls them. Guys 
I used to hang out with. People 
who made an impression on Buba 
because of their quirks and atti
tudes, like the guy who used to 
dress up like Paladin [the title char
acter from an old cowboy TV show]. 
He wore the black hat, had a big 
mustache, black vest. He recalls a 
British man who would stand in 
the middle of Braddock Avenue and 
recite Shakespeares plays verba
tim. They were just everywhere, 
says Buba.
Sweet Sal is an example. Bubas 
short film, Sweet Sal, follows a 
Braddock man in his daily life. Sal, a 
gruff, blue-collar, talkative man, jokes 
with his buddies in a bar, visits the 
grave of his father, and tells us, with 
a bizarre nonchalance, about his ex
perience with drugs and alcohol.
According to Buba,
The Players Manual
by Amit N. Kar
Cricket is the British Commonwealths 
equivalent of Baseball. Theres a batsman 
(batter) who faces a small hard ball thrown 
at him by a bowler (pitcher). The batsman 
stands in front of three wooden sticks 
stuck in the ground, called stumps. If the 
bowler can get the cricket ball past the 
batsman and knock the stumps over, the 
batsman is out. Unless the umpire decides 
that some penalty was committed, the 
batsman is out, no questions asked.
Sometime near the end of the last 
century, a famous British cricketer 
called W.G. Grace was up at bat.

But those people started to dis

Buba. Theres more conformity

These were marginal people, and 
where can you get work if youre a 
marginal person?
In spite of its decline, Buba is 
still proud of his town. Most people 
that grew up here, theyre really 
proud they grew up in Braddock. 
He is touched by the nation wide 
group called Friends of Braddock,

a second World War, Saddam would 
,have left Kuwait at the first sign of 
irritation from the U.S., and Charles; 
would never have dumped Diana for 
that dilapidated prune Camilla. The 
trick to effective negotiation is to 
grasp the underlying motivations of 
both yourself and your 
counterpart(s).
But the skills and knowledge that go 
into becoming a complete negotiator 
are being developed by a small clique of 
professionals, mostly overpaid manage
ment consultants and academics who 
need to secure tenure publishing, even 
if its total garbage. The worst thing 
about this state of affairs is that a 
handful of consultants and academics 
are making a crapload of money off of 
teaching people basic common sense.

Harvard professors, will know what I

to reading this book  Crap, this 
sucks, I knew all this already, and,

But, while the subject matter may 
seem painfully obvious, it is often th 
case that we need to be taught the mos 
basic things. Were lucky here at CMU 
in that conflict resolution and negotia

 the Middle East, Donsky said. 
He added that for some, celebrat
ing their Judaism may be taking 
pride in the various Jews who 
have made distinct contributions 
in the fields of art, writing, and 
peace-keeping.
[My Judaism] comes up in 
most conversations because of 
what I do. Even when I wasnt 
[working for Hillel], I was active 
in my community, and I plan to 
be active in my life. Part of that 
is being a role model for Jewish 
people and non-Jews  not that 
theyll look at me and say, I 
want to be Jewish, but that they 
can say, Hey, shes really proud 
of herself, said Sheridan. 
Whether people are Persian, 
black, or from Scotland, they 
should study who they are and 
learn their history so they can 
share it with others for the pur
pose of diversity and study.
a non-threatening, 
comfortable environDient, said Donsky.
A non-Jewish student once 
asked Donsky if he would answer 
her questions about Judaism 
since she wasnt comfortable ask
ing her Jewish friends. It was a 
wonderful moment because most 
students who didnt grow up 
around Jews didnt get a chance 
to ask questions. [JAM] might 
allow people to break down barri
ers, to feel comfortable with their 
Jewish friends, said Donsky.
I like to tell [my friends] sto
ries about my personal experi
ences [to celebrate my Jewish 
heritage]. I lived in Israel for a 
year, and I like to tell about how 
my Jewish identity has been 
formed through positive and 
negative experiences.... I consider

An Anecdote...
Two guys are sitting in a bar at the top of the Empire. State Building. One 
guy says to the other,
You know, the wind currents between these buildings are so strong that 
if you jump off the edge, theyll lift you right back up.
In disbelief, the other guy said, No way, man."
The first guy said, Way. Ill bet you 50 bucks that if I jump off this building, 
the wind currents will lift me right back up.
Being a little smackered, the guy agreed.
So the first guy jumps off the edge of the building, and sure enough, the 
wind currents swept him right back up and landed him back where he 
started. With a resonating Whoa, the other guy handed 
him the 50 bucks and jumped off without a second to 
spare. BAM! He hit the pavement and died instantly.
Upon returning to the bar, the bartender said to the 
first guy, "Superman, you're an asshole when youre 
drunk."

Tartan Diversions Editor
Valentines Day is getting eerily close. 
While couples are planning for the big 
night, singles are making excuses for 
the big night. But no matter what your 
status, events, are happening around 
campus ancflaimmd lihe city to enter
tain, ma^e^eart^ Beat faster, and pro
vide an oimf^^ifalentines Day angst.
Since this'H^rbf Ich^falls.on a Friday 
this year, no excuses need be made about 
an excess of homework. If you dont have 
a special someone to go out with, you' 
wont be alone in your solitariness. Find 
another single soul and enjoy yourself 
who knows, maybe cupid will shoot his 
arrow your way. The pressure may be 
great to celebrate, but finding some
thing to do wont be difficult.
On campus, Kresge Theatre will be 
filled with laughter and music. The 
Drama Departments season opens on 
February 14 with their first production 
of the semester, Cloud Nine. Or if your 
singing skills are a bit rusty but you 
want your valentine to hear love songs, 
A Valentine Cabaret, featuring all the 
mushy love songs you could ever want to
hear, will be presented on February 16 
at 7:30 pm. You can take your sweet
heart to hear love songs sung better 
than you ever could muster and you 
will be supporting the Pittsburgh New 
Voices group.
Speaking of fundraisers, the Ballroom 
Dance Team will be holding a dinner 
and dance on Thursday to raise money 
for their trip to England over Spring 
Break. If your idea of 
Valentines fun is 
dressing up and '* 
dancing the night 
away, take that speciaTSoye muffin to 
Rangos Hall. There 
will even Be* aimonstrations if you need^ 
to brush up on your 
dancing skills.
If you want to get away 
from campus for the big night, 
a variety of things are happeningin theBurgh. PittsburghBaetTheatrewfll TartanConWb"ting Editor 
be presenting a version 
ofRomeo and Juliet on the stage through
out the weekend. Described by the the
atre as a lush celebration of passion
and beauty, the production seems per
fect for mushy sweethearts.
If Thank God Im a Country Boy is 
your idea of an anthem of love, you may 
want to check out the Pittsburgh Sym
phony Orchestra on Friday and Satur
day as they welcome John Denver. 
This songwriter and performer will be 
singing some of his most popular 
works with the full accompaniment of 
the Orchestra.
Or if all else fails and you 
are running low on funds, 
"Student Dormitory Coun
cil has conveniently sched
uled to show Romeo and 
'Juliet on Friday in the 
McConomy Auditorium for 
the thrifty price of one dol
lar. So if you have no money 
or just arent sure if you 
want to spend a lot of mula on 
your valentine, this might be a 
safe bet.
Valentines Day can be a 
tricky occasion, but no mat
ter what your feelings to
ward the day, the day would be better 
spent outside the confines of 
your room.
Flower showcase offers visitors 
short stroll down Lovers Lane
By ANNE RAY
Tartan Assistant Features Editor
Ophelia, from Shakespeares Hamlet 
said this of flowers: Theres rosemary, 
thats for remembrance: ... and theres 
fennel [flattery] for you, and columbines 
[folly]; theres rue [repentance] for you: 
and heres some for me ...
Especially around Valentines Day, 
flowers take on a meaning besides just 
petals and a sweet smell. At the Phipps 
Conservatory, the Lovers Lane: The 
Language of Flowers exhibit deciphers 
these other meanings.
Red roses say I love you, and are 
probably the most common Valentines 
Day gift. Other flowers are often ne
glected, but Phipps brings to light the 
meanings associated with other variet
ies of flowers. For example, Calla Lily
means magnificent beauty and bloom- more effort into their winter and spring 
ingIvy symbolizes wedded love, just to shows, which makes for a somewhat 
name a few. disappointing show at any other time of
In the Serpentine Room of the Phipps the year. I was expecting the to see the 
Conservatory, hundreds of different walls and ceiling coated with lavender 
types of flowers are planted in winding, buds or something and the room to be 
well-kept flower beds, each with 
an explanation as to what that 
particular flower means when 
given as a gift. A red-brick path
way snakes between the flower 
beds, and stone statues and foun
tains accent the bright colors of the 
flowers.
Besides the many varieties of 
plants and flowers, there were

With Valentines Day 
being the most oppor
tune time to bestow 
your loved one with 
flowers of one variety of 
another, you would 
think that the horticul
turists at Phipps would 
be able to make their 
exhibit fill more than 
one medium-sized room 
that isnt even as full of 
plants as it could be. It 
seems like Phipps puts
als, but all I saw was a big garden with 
some name tags added.
On a snowy morning, though, the 
Phipps Conservatory is a nice refuge 
from the nasty Pittsburgh weather. As 
Craig Frand, the Phipps event coordina
tor, said of the facility, Its like being 
outdoors, indoors.
But even if there is only one room 
devoted to Valentines Day, it will still 
make you dwell on your love life a bit. I 
went to Phipps with a girlfriend from 
across the hall, and after gazing at lacey 
orchids and babys breath for an hour 
and a half, we were both complaining 
that no one had bought us any flowers in 
a while.

Critics list features 
top ten love songs
By TOM LIN
Tartan Staffwriter
A time-honored tradition that has 
long dominated the minds of both 
lovers and cynics is the annual Top 
Ten Cool Love Songs to Listen to On 
Valentines Day list. Eagerly antici
pated, this list is the definitive guide 
to the best love songs to listen to with 
your significant other in 
order to bring about that 
special Valentines Day 
mood. Although these 
songs were chosen com
pletely arbitrarily, I fol
lowed only the most rig
orous scientific proce
dures and stringent 
health conditions to de
termine which songs 
were qualified to be in
cluded in this demand
ing critique. So, without 
any further fanfare, here 
is ... The List.
10. Only in Dreams,
Weezer. This pathetic yet 
humorous song details 
the near-hallucinogenic 
dream state of a re
pressed teenager who The Polices 
looks forward to this es- number 4 on 
capist unreality in order to break the 
mundane from which he seemingly 
cannot be released in the waking 
world. Scores well for incorporating 
chemistry into the lyrics.
9. Angel, Aerosmith. Yet another 
ode to the perfection of women, and 
the resulting corollary: insignificance 
of men. The inherent superiority of 
females is made very clear in this 
almost-desperate cry for help by the 
lesser half of the species, which alone 
makes it deserving of inclusion 
on this list. And it has a 
nice melody, too.
8. Friday Im in Love,
The Cure. OK, this is 
not exactly a love 
sng, per se. But it is 
a cool song. And it has 
Love in the title. So 
there.
7. Ana Ng, They Might 
Be Giants. A strangely depress
ing song, its subject matter contrasts 
with its chipper and upbeat tone. In 
actuality, this song is a bitter denun
ciation of chance and fate. Emotion
ally weighty, with funny lyrics. They 
did it again!
6. Brown-Eyed Girl, Van Morrison.
A. bright, happy tune that you can
hum along to or belt out at the top of 
your voice. Enjoyment of this song is 
increased exponentially if, in fact, 
you do have a brown-eyed girl to sing 
this to/with/about.
5. Into Your Arms, The 
Lemonheads. This song reveals the 
fragility of the human soul, as the 
speaker searches out a safe haven in 
order to escape from the travails of

Every Breath You Take stands at 
the top ten list.
the world around him. This may also 
be interpreted as an unconscious 
Freudian wish for a return to the 
womb, to the epitome of security. This 
struggle between man and nature, as 
well as the songs funky pop quality, 
guarantees it a spot in the list.
4. Every Breath You Take, The Po
lice. The ultimate in misunderstood 
songs. Stalker theme or mere 
infatuation? The ques
tion continues to 
draw controversy, 
though most im
pressive is the fact 
that it continues to 
please the discrimi
nating ear, no mat
ter what one may de
cide.
3. Blew Away, 
Smashing Pumpkins. 
For an A side song on a 
B side album, this mel
low yet emotional tune 
will stick in your head and pos
sess your soul. Listen to it while alone, 
or better yet, while with your signifi
cant other. It will amaze you and 
perform lesser miracles. In summa
tion, it will... blow you away, (groan)

cific. So, with time to spare, theBy DAN GOLDWASSER
Tartan Staffwriter
In 1988, John Cleese (of Monty 
Python fame) had us on the floor 
with his comedy A Fish Called 
Wanda. Starring Cleese, Kevin 
Kline, Jamie Lee Curtis, and 
Michael Palin (also of Python 
fame), the comedy was a delight
ful romp showcasing the mishaps 
of a group of jewel thieves. Now, 
nine years later, Cleese presents 
a new comedy to us  one that 
reunites the cast of A Fish 
Called Wanda.
What: Fierce Creatures 
Director: Robert Young 
Company: Universal 
Pictures
Fierce Creatures is about a 
multinational conglomerates 
takeover of a British zoo, and 
why everything goes entirely 
wrong. Willa Weston (Jamie Lee 
Curtis, True Lies) is a high-pow
ered executive who is placed in 
charge of the Marwood Zoo by 
Rod McCain, (Kevin Kline, 
Dave) the owner of the conglom
erate. She is sent to England 
with Rods boorish son, Vince 
(Kline), who wants nothing more 
than to sleep with Willa. Mean
while, Rollo Lee (Cleese) had 
been sent to begin the takeover 
of the zoo. McCain expects a 20 
percent return on all his invest
ments, so Rollo proposes popu
lating the zoo with only viscious 
animals, since violence is so 
popular. Unfortunately, this 
means the kinder, gentler ani
mals must be destroyed. Most of 
the zookeepers, including Insect 
Wrangler Adrian Malone 
(Palin), are not too fond of this 
idea, and have their own plans 
for the zoo. Zany antics ensue, 
and many a laugh will follow.
While touching at moments, 
and downright hysterical at oth
ers, Fierce Creatures seems a bit 
choppy. Many of the jokes are 
set up well in advance, and it
seems that we are being spoon
fed the jokes, instead of discover
ing the humor in them for our
selves. Director Robert Young 
CSplitting Heirs) did a fine job 
with directing the first 75 per
cent of the film  there was just 
nothing special about it. The story 
had its roots back in a comedy 
playhouse script written by 
Michael Palin and Terry Jones 
pr e-Monty Python, but never com
missioned. The remainder of it 
came about just after Wanda. Due 
to scheduling conflicts, the four 
actors were never quite able to 
commit to a filming schedule. Fi
nally, in the summer of 1995, 
they filmed principal photogra
phy  and Palin left four days 
later to Siberia, for a nine-month 
journey around the Pacific Rim 
on another series of his awardwinning BBC television travel 
programs. Unfortunately, when 
test audiences disliked the end
ing, everyone agreed to reshoot 
the ending. But Palin still had 
another eight months in the Paother actors went on to 
other commitments.
Finally, when Palin returned, 
they were ready to shoot the new 
ending, but Robert Young was off 
on another project, and so Fred 
Schepisi was called in to film the 
new ending. So, as one would 
imagine, the ending felt a bit 
tacked on, and not on the same 
level as the rest of the film. 
Granted, it was all very funny, 
but it left a strange taste in my 
mouth.
People have wondered if Fierce 
Creatures is a sequel to A Fish 
Called Wanda. Kevin Kline (who 
won an Academy Award for 
Wanda) calls Fierce Creatures an 
equal, not a sequel. I would have 
to disagree with him  the final 
product is just not as funny as 
Wanda was. It was worth a mati
nee price  and definitely see it 
on video if you dont see it in the 
theater. But if you are going to go 
to an evening movie and pay full 
price, see Star Wars instead.
Punk band rocks club audience
By KEVIN JAMES MEEHAN
Dossier Literary Editor
Social Distortion played at 
Metropol last Sunday to a soldout crowd. I had never seen them 
play live before because they used 
to tour the East Coast infre
quently, but now that theyve re
leased a brand-new album (White 
Light, White Heat, White Trash 
on Sony 550 Music), theyre back 
on tour and will pick up right 
where they left off with 1992s 
Somewhere Between Heaven and 
Hell. Theyve come back to their 
roots and are making music the 
way that made them famous. That 
is to say, punk with a dash of 
rockabilly, self-described white 
trash music that is distinctly 
their own. The current lineup 
consists of Mike Ness on lead 
guitar and vocals, Dennis Dannell 
on rhythm guitar, John Maurer 
on bass, and Chuck Biscuits (exD.O.A.) on drums.
Social D. started out the set 
with their classic Stones cover 
song, Under My Thumb, now 
also an unlisted track on their 
new CD. After the new radio 
singles, Mike and the boys dove 
into Mommys Little Monster 
(first released in 1983 on An
other State of Mind). The songs

screws up his/her life through 
the attempt to fit in with those

Play examines 
teenage issues
By BECCA FRIBUSH
Tartan Staffwriter
Youve got to love any play 
featuring a character who sings 
songs to a giant stuffed el
ephant. Scotch n Sodas latest 
production, Sometimes I Wake 
Up in the Middle of the Night 
which was performed last week
end, gave the audience a chance 
to take in this unique sight in 
not one, but two scenes.
Not that the elephant was 
the only interesting thing, of 
course. Sometimes, a collec
tion of intertwined 
monologues and 
scenes by the students 
at the Walden Theatre 
Conservatory, offered 
outstanding acting by 
the whole cast and 
some fairly perceptive 
comments about teen
age life.
The play, directed by 
sophomore math ma
jor Hannah Rohlfs, 
has almost no plot to 
speak of, but surpris
ingly this isnt much 
of an impediment. The 
audience got to eaves
drop on a dozen char
acters ruminating 
about love, suicide, in
security, and that pe
rennial teenage favor
ite, lust. The play re
alistically depicted the 
way that actual kids 
think and express themselves, 
since it was developed by stu
dents. We all know that in real 
life people hardly ever sit there 
and expose their deepest emo
tions and vulnerabilities in 
monologues, but the combina
tion of the non-cutesy, nonmelodramatic script and the ac
tors skill in bringing the words 
to life made it seem to be the 
most natural thingin the world.
Yet many of the most intense 
and memorable scenes de
pended on more than one actor 
for their emotional punch. The 
dialogue between a girl drunk 
on self-pity and alcohol and her 
boyfriend (played by Amber 
King and Max Chittister) whom 
she feels is abandoning her as 
he gets ready to leave for col
lege, certainly falls into this cat
egory. Another moving scene 
featured several friends chat
ting innocently away. One of
them (Renee Littleton) leaves 
the group and begins a reflec
tive monologue about a failed 
suicide attempt. As if to under
score her desire to keep this 
part of her life secret, she 
abruptly switches back into 
light conversational mode as 
she rejoins her friends.
Sometimes also featured just 
enough touches of inspired 
weirdness to undercut the pre
vailing serious mood. One of 
the funniest moments of the 
evening involved Josh Horan, 
as that guy who talks to stuffed
Diana Bartolotta/Tartan Darkroom Manager 
Students showed off their acting talent.
animals, looking lovingly into 
his elephants eyes and singing 
something or other about 
popsicles.
We also got to hear Lou 
Bojarskis character recite his 
girlfriends excruciatingly bad 
love poetry (You make the 
earth spin around / And if you 
were a dog, Id rescue you from 
the pound), and Nikki 
McCreas character generally 
act like a ditz.
Clever choices of background 
music enhanced many of the 
.scenes. My favorite was My 
Love (Youre Never Gonna 
Get It), which fit in quite 
nicely after H&SS freshman 
T. K. Fife had finished a 
speech on his longing for sex 
with someone, anyone.
The spare, abstract set pro
vided a flexible platform with
out taking attention away from 
the actors, where it belonged.

Comics depict tales of love
COMIC BOOK 
CHRONICLES
by Max Chittister
With Valentines Day approaching, Ive 
been thinking about romance and comic 
books. Yes, I find something ro
mantic about comicbooks. My girl
friend is now hooked on Legion,
Flash, and Impulse, thanks to me.
Weve spent many a romantic din
ner discussing Crisis on Infinite 
Earth and why it was so much 
better than that Infinity crap.
Our relationship is fine, thanks 
for asking.
In the comic books Ive read over 
the years, Ive seen some very 
sweet, romantic issues and sto
ries. These stories reaffirm in me 
the belief that two people really 
can make a relationship in this 
topsy-turvy world of ours. And then 
there are the stories that yank 
that belief out of my heart like 
that guy from Temple of Doom.
So for your Valentines Day plea
sure, a list of what comics to read 
(and what comics to avoid) with 
the fanboy or fangirl you love:
Avoid at all costs:
Ray 18-19. November - Decem
ber, 1995. The devil wants to steal 
Rays soul, so he disguises himself 
as a beautiful blonde. Ray frenchkisses Satan. All hell breaks loose.
For most of Ray 19, he stumbles 
around muttering, I kissed a guy.
everything to do with bad love life choices.
All Access 1-4. December 1996-February 1997. The only truty bad comic 
books on the Bad Romance list. Hero 
has the ability to cross back and forth 
between the DC and Marvel universes. 
So he keeps a girlfriend in each uni
verse. And this is a hero? The main plot 
sucks about as hard as the romantic 
subplot does.
Somewhere in the middle:
Justice League America 45. December 
1990. On one hand, never ever ever take 
a Norwegian ice goddess to a cockfight. 
But if you do, make up for it by taking 
her to the Ice Capades.
Courtesy of DC Comics
Hi]arious story," but Yomanti- JusticeLeaueAmerica45offersa lovestor>*oumiht We^^^DougMTenXpus
the survivors. It turns out, she missed 
her flight. But she rejects his proposal 
anyway. Great story from Priest, but 
probably not for Valentines Day.
Tempest 1-4. November 1996-February 1997 A story about coming to 
grips with losing someone you love. Stun
ning visuals from Phil Jiminez, who 
also handled the writing chores. A mustread, but not while youre missing some
one on the 14th.
Aww, theyre so cute:
Impulse 20. December 1996. Mark 
Waid again. Young Bart Allens first 
kiss happens in the middle of a baseball 
game after he hits his first home run. 
Immediately after, he and Carol 
both get the giggles. Impulse is 
the best book DC is publishing, 
and this issue is one of the best.
Flash 62- present. May 1992- 
present. Mark Waid, one more 
time. Hes described Flash as 
more romance than action be
cause of the Flashs relation
ship with his girlfriend, Linda 
Park. Ignore the fact that shes 
a stereotypical reporter girl
friend, and this is a great dy
namic relationship. They fight, 
they argue, they act like real 
people trying to figure out if 
they should get married. And 
they love each other. In Flash 
99 -100, he gives up the chance 
to go to paradise because he 
wouldnt be able to take her 
with him.
Mister Miracle 1-28. Janu
ary 1989-June 1991. Atypically, this is a comic book about 
a married superhero. On the 
other hand, his wife vacuums 
under the couch by lifting the 
entire couch over her head with 
one hand. This is an under
rated series, with some great 
writing by J.M. DeMatteis, Len
cally, death.
Valor 9. July 1993. Before you beat up 
the local law enforcement in order to 
impress a girl, make sure the local law 
enforcement isnt the girls father. Mark 
Waid (get used to seeing this name) and 
Paris Cullins fill-in issue has nothing to 
do with the continuing storyline, has
not want to share with your valentine.
Ray Annual 1. Ray is ready to propose 
to his girlfriend, but a supervillian shoots 
down her plane. Ray saves the plane, 
thinking about nothing but, Ive got to 
save Jenny! Ray keeps the 747 from 
crashing, saving 112 people, but 18 die 
in the crash. Ray cant find Jenny among
a married couple with a believ
able relationship.
Just keep this in mind on Valentines 
Day  the best comic book in the world 
(Crisis 7) doesnt compare with spend
ing time with the person you love. So on 
Friday, make sure you put down the 
comic and tell someone you love them.

Being alone and hungry out in a 
desert sure will make ya examine your 
morals, asserts Vernal Right, one of 
three eccentric characters in last weeks 
studio production of Big Wide Empty 
by Matthew Southworth. And to a large 
extent, the play does force you to ex
amine its moral.
The story pits comedy against sus
pense, suspense against frivolity, and 
frivolity against romance. It manages 
these contrasting elements under the 
guise of simplicity  the play seems 
light and undemanding, and the expetogether. Women cant stick together 
on account of they gotta stand by 
their man. Nice system you got 
there, Alice complains.
After being lost and tired for days, 
Vernal confesses a love for Alice, and 
she reciprocates the notion. This in
stantaneous change is quite a stretch, 
but it welcomes new plot ideas. It 
would have Jedediah Sneed (Paul 
Domencic) return from the almostdead to shoot Vernal and cart away 
Alice, forgiving and claiming to her 
that he is a reformed husband.
With this catalyst, new opposites 
appear. Alices fear-compliance re
lationship with Jed contrasts her
"The story pits comedy against suspense, 
suspense against frivolity, and frivolity 
against romance. 
rience is quite enjoyable. Yet it is com
plex. Its a sea of compliements and 
opposites: A technique that operates 
well in most ways, but appears eccen
tric at times.
The story tells what happens when a 
fugitive woman, her pursuer, and the 
husband she thought she murdered 
come together in the big wide empty 
of the desert.
This setting initiates the first of con
trasts the desert is in fact not empty, 
but full of treasure, conflict, and soonto-be romance. And though set in the 
Old West, todays slang permeates 
the dialogue.
Vernal Right (Dustin Brown) finally 
catches Alice (Heather Mazur) and, 
holding her at gunpoint, begins to es
cort her to the local judge. Alice has 
killed her tyrannical husband, the 
meanest man in the world. The in
competent warden and his sarcastic 
prisoner exchange insults, much to 
humors end. Their conversation in
troduces more polar pairs  male/ 
female stereotypes, and physical ver
sus emotional suffering. Men stick
recently found love for Vernal. The 
tone of violence portrayed when Jed 
literally brands his wife grates 
with silly musical numbers that sud
denly appear.
Eventually Vernal revives to fight 
Jed, and Alice intervenes by killing 
her husband (for real) with the brand
ing stick. In an all-too-cheesy ending, 
she learns her lovers name; she has 
literally found Mr. Right.
The actors and actress in this per
formance were excellent. Mazur 
played Alice with the perfect balance 
of stereotype and depth for this sort of 
work. Brown and Domencic were 
equally apt, the former going from 
villain to anti-hero to hero, and the 
latter successfully jumping all over 
the emotional scale.
Director Bruce Wallace Hostetler 
should be commended for juggling 
the themes in Big Wide Empty ap
propriately. By all reasoning, 
Southworths work is not a simple 
farce. Its not an all-out comedy, 
tragedy, love story, or musical, but 
its a little bit of each.

Timi il
movies you may have seen before....,
BY GREG MARCKS
Thursday, February 13
Cinema Paradiso
Winner of the 1989 Best Foreign Film Oscar, this 
Italian flick portrays a projectionist not unlike the 
one who will be sleeping contently in the booth 
behind you. If youve never seen subtitles before, 
nows your chance. Or just listen to cool Italian 
phrases like molto beno, Chef Boyardee, and Paul 
Newmans Own.
Set in a small Italian town afterWorld War II, this 
film is about a young boy obsessed with movies. (I 
know it sounds unrealistic, but try to suspend your 
disbelief.) Poignantly, the projectionist takes the 
kid aside and explains to him that theres more to 
life than movies. But try to overlook that message 
until youve already purchased your ticket. Grazi.
At 7:30,10 pm, and 12:30 am.
In DH 2210

Romeo and Juliet
In 10th grade, all the boys talked about was seeing 
Romeo and Juliet in English class, because you got 
to see Juliets breasts. Unlike most rumors, this one 
turned out to be true. However, the film highlighted 
more of Romeos butt than anything else, bringing 
much disappointment.
This version is different. Its like rollerskating on 
acid with a micro-fridge strapped to your back, and 
we all know what thats like. With guns and crazy 
MTV-style camerawork and a bitching soundtrack 
and fast-paced edits, its just about everything 
Shakespeare never intended. Luckily hes dead and 
cant do a damn thing about it.
So check it out. It beats reading the play.
At 7:30, 10 pm, and 12:30 am.

Saturday, February 15
Pretty Woman
Now heres a flick Valentines Day wouldnt be 
caught dead without. Lets see, it must have been six 
years ago that a girl popped this one in the VCR. So 
it was slightly less than six years ago that I quickly 
lost interest and went downstairs to mess around 
with her brothers drum set.
Im not saying its bad, Im just saying its sappy. 
But thats what this holiday is all about, pure 
unadulterated sappiness. And heres your recipe: 
Add two cups Richard Gere, then sprinkle liberally 
with Julia Roberts. Stir in Jason Alexander until a 
smooth, rich texture is achieved. Let cool, and then 
apply a generous portion of Roy Orbison #4 frosting.
For those of you who have ever wondered what 
Cinderella would have been like as a prostitute, 
feast away. I think youll be pleasantly unsurprised.
At 7:30, 10 pm, and 12:30 am.

Sunday, February 16
Silver Bullet
As we all know, the silver bullet is the one that 
wont slow you down but will do a number on 
werewolves. Call them lycanthropes, actually, if you 
want to sound snooty. Snooty? Snotty. Snotty?
As you would expect, this movie stars Corey Haim, 
who youll remember as the Corey who wasnt in The 
Goonies. Also putting in an appearance is Lawrence 
Tierney, the husky-voiced fatman from Reservoir 
Dogs. Together, this wacky duo sets out for, you 
guessed it, werewolf pot pie. And for all you literary 
nuts, the story comes from Stephen Kings Cycle of 
the Werewolf.
At 8, 10 pm, and 12 am.

Films special effects defy reality
By RYAN DONOVAN
Assistant Diversions Editor
Theres this little thing called 
suspension of disbelief that most 
movies and fiction rely on. Most 
of the time, the movies supposed 
to do it for you. But sometimes 
you just have to ignore those 
things which may have less than 
a toehold on credibility.
What: Dante's Peak 
] Director: Roger
Donaldson 
| Company: Universal 
Pictures
Which brings us to Dantes 
Peak. Dantes Peak is about a 
volcano. If youve heard of the 
movie, you know that already. A 
volcano I can believe. Mass de
struction I can believe. Outrun
ning an explosive blast that takes 
a minute to get from the moun
tain to the town a few miles away 
in a shaky looking pickup truck is 
about where I draw the line.
But like I mentioned, some
times you have to suspend your 
own disbelief to enjoy the movie. 
And thats just what you should 
do. Forget about those silly little
things that get in the way of real
ism and enjoy the ride.
Dantes Peak is a tasty bit of eye 
candy starring Pierce Bronsan as 
U.S. Geological Survey vulcanologist Harry Dalton and Linda 
Hamilton as Rachel Wando, the 
mayor of Dantes Peak.
The movie starts a little slow. 
Theres all this arguing over 
whether or not the mountain is 
going to blow. Dalton thinks it 
could go at any time and tries to 
gather evidence, but his boss, 
Paul Dreyfus (played by Charles 
Hallahan) thinks it would be best 
to not send the town into an un
necessary panic. This tension is 
really unnecessary; we know 
what the movie is all about. We 
came to see a volcano. After all, 
they didnt spend $100 million 
on catering.
There are also a few minor 
sparks between Dalton and 
Wando, butit doesnt overshadow 
the real fireworks. And when it 
goes, boy howdy, does it blow its 
top in style. Digital Domain 
(nominated for an Oscar for Apollo 
13) created amazing effects for 
the production. Not only is there 
digital lava and an erupting vol
cano, but they blow stuff up real
well. The effects are seamless, 
and they are truly the star of 
Dantes Peak.
There are several points in the 
movie that could have been betcape with an S on it, I could have 
believed it more easily.
Dantes Peak is among the new 
crop of disaster movies trying to 
ride the coattails of Twister and
1997 Universal Studios
Harry (Pierce Brosnan) and Rachel (Linda Hamilton) run from a volcano 
in Dante's Peak.
ter, where disbelief rears its ugly 
head. Many scenes looked as 
though they were from a truck 
commercial, as their pickup drove 
through everything thrown at it. 
Maybe if the truck had a little red
Independence Day. Whereas some 
of them are utter flops, Dantes 
Peak is worth the price of admis- : 
sion. See it at least for the vol
cano and, everyones favorite, 
mass destruction.

On the Tube
by Dan Rosenberg
Amid the over-hyped movies, 
ridiculous home videos, dull news 
magazines, and inane sitcoms 
airing this Sunday, there exists a 
hidden gem that demands re
peated viewings. This diamond 
in the rough is the latest install
ment in the marvelous Prime 
Suspect series, a masterpiece 
that airs, appropriately, during 
Masterpiece Theatre (WQED, 
Sundays, 9-11 pm).
I realize that there are numer
ous myths out there about pro
gramming on PBS. Many people 
believe that only stuffy intellec
tuals and young children watch 
public broadcasting because the 
only programs on the station are 
either boring documentaries and 
period pieces or childrens pro
grams such as Sesame Street and 
Mr. Rogers Neighborhood. Al
though these types of program
ming can still be found on PBS, 
public television offers so much 
more, including productions of 
Arthur Millers Broken Glass (a 
remarkable teleplay about the 
Holocausts effects on Jews in 
America), the House of Cards tril
ogy (a British satire too bitter 
and dead-on to be filmed in 
America), and most recently The 
Politicians Wife (a fascinating 
tale of revenge in which sex is the 
underlying motif). Best of all is 
the Suspect series, which 
began in 1992 and has been on 
my top ten list of programs ev
ery year since.
At the end of the last Suspect 
episode, Detective Superinten
dent J ane Tennison (marvelously 
played by Emmy-winner Helen 
Mirren) threw wine in her bosss 
face at a formal gathering. As a 
result, she is demoted and trans
ferred from London to Manches
ter, where her first case in the 
new locale involves a sadistic drug 
lord known as The Street 
(played to the hilt by Steven 
Mackintosh). Tennison also finds 
herself becoming romantically 
involved with her married super
visor (John McArdle) and indi
rectly causing a boys gruesome 
death. Be warned, Suspect is vio
lent and often disturbing, but it
provides an electrifying viewing 
experience. With each episode, it 
gets closer and closer to dethron
ing Hill Street Blues as the great
est program in television history.
Also airing on Sunday is the 
antithesis of Suspect  a dread
ful, simplistic, badly acted, terri
bly written comedy entitled 3rd 
Rock from the Sun (NBC, 
Sundays, 8-8:30 pm), an 
unfathomably popular show that 
became one of last years biggest 
hits. 3rd Rock focuses on a group 
of aliens (played by the overact
ing quartet of John Lithgow, the 
grating French Stewart, Kristen 
Johnston, and Joseph GordonLevitt) who come to Earth (East
ern Ohio, to be exact) and pose as 
a professor and his three chil
dren. The results, as you may 
expect, are farcical, as the aliens 
learn about everything our planet 
has to offer, including babies, eth
nic backgrounds, football, and the 
education system. This fish-outof-water premise has worked be
fore, in everything from Private 
Benjamin (spoiled rich girl joins 
the army) to Cheers (intellectual 
becomes barmaid), but the con
cept cant sustain 3rd Rock.
The fact that the show is 
unwatchable isnt the fault of 
stars Lithgow and Jane Curtin,
both of whom are fine actors. 
Rather, the blame falls largely on 
the incompetent writers whose 
idea of a joke is watching Lithgow 
and company fall over each other 
and then do something inappro
priate like slap someone. What 
results is dreadfully unfunny 
slapstick that quickly becomes 
unbearable. It is interesting to 
note, however, that 3rd Rock re
cently was named best comedy 
series by the Hollywood Foreign 
Press Association, thereby con
firming the fact that the voters in 
this category are obviously either 
on drugs or senile (last year they' 
honored the mediocre Cybill).
There you have it: Sundays 
best and Sundays worst. While 
Prime Suspect is an example of 
how good television can be, 3rd 
Rock shows just how low the me
dium can sink. Of course, there 
wouldnt be programs as bad as 
3rd Rock if people would just stop 
watching them and tune in to 
high-quality shows like Suspect... 
but thats another gripe Ill have 
to discuss at a later time.
Prime Suspect: A+. 3rd Rock

U2 tops list of all time greatest love songs
LOVE SONGS, from page L7
2. Desperado, The Eagles. Much 
symbolism and gambling are 
tightly bound within the confines 
of this haunting song, creating 
an experience that both saddens 
yet inspires at once. If youre still 
looking for that special some
one, then this song should be 
your anthem. Stand and salute
when it plays.
1. More Human than 
Human, White Zom
bie. *From the open
ing notes of this ten
der, introspective 
song, this light little 
ditty will have you 
swaying to its gentle 
beat. In particular, the
first part of the song will have the 
entire room singing along to 
its simple yet touching 
lyrics.
*Ahem* But seri
ously...
1. With or With
out You, U2. Perhaps 
the perfect song for 
couples and singles alike, this
song does it all. Touching and 
poignant, deeply emotional and 
heartfelt, this may be the apex of 
U2s long career. Its cool. 
Thats it. Find a song 
2 \ on here that you never 
sf? \ heard before, and 
1 listen to it. I guaran
tee that you wont 
regret it.

Many people often find 
themselves lonely during 
this momentous occasion. 
Often, they find themselves 
shelling out big bucks for 
flowers and candy which 
they have sent to them
selves at the office so that 
others will come up and 
compliment them.
Others might try the timehonored trick of hiring their 
brother or sister-in-law to 
come pose as their escort for 
the evening. This masquer
ade ceases to work after co
workers watch and wait for 
the momentous French kiss. 
The Tartan does not recom
mend this course of action. 
Instead, please call your 
folks and enjoy a rousing 
phone conversation with 
them. Remember, friends 
dont let their friends kiss 
the in-laws.
You can advertise for 
free in The Tartan!
If you know of an event on or off cam
pus that has relevance to the campus 
community, email auyoung@andrew. 
cmu.edu or mail it to The Tartan, Box 
17 in the Carnegie Mellon University 
Center by the Wednesday before the 
date of the event.
Vox Populi is a forum open to the 
entire campus community! To submit a 
vox, simply email it to auyoung@ 
andrew.cmu.edu, send it to The Tartan, 
Box 17 via campus mail, or drop it in 
the Vox Populi drop box on the infamous 
Tartan Server.
Remember, the Vox reuses boxes 
and fills them with lox to give to the 
really red fox, Mr. Walkenstox.
