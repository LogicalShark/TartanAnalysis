Officials who have worked with 
Carnegie Mellon President-elect 
Robert Mehrabian at the Univer
sity of California at Santa Barbara 
attribute the advancement of 
UCSBs engineering school to his 
energy, vision, and talents.
Mehrabian was unanimously 
elected to succeed outgoing Carne

Cyert at a special meeting of the 
Board of Trustees last Wednesday.
Mehrabian will take office when 
Cyert steps down on June 30.
Mehrabian enhanced the stand
ing and reputation of the College of 
Engineering here, says Jacqueline 
Hynes, assistant dean of engineer
ing at UCSB. She says his work is 
symbolized in the March 19 issue of 
U. S. News and World Report, which 
ranks Mehrabians school as the 
number one up and coming gradu

Kidnappers
victimize

By DON PICKETT
Tartan Contributing Editor
A Carnegie Mellon 
student was abducted, 
stabbed, and robbed on 
Forbes Avenue early 
Thursday morning as 
he walked to campus.
Also this week, the 
wife of a MEMS re
search associate was 
kidnapped as she 
crossed Forbes Avenue 
to the Skibo parking 
lot.
The student was 
taken to Shadyside 
Hospital after suffer
ing 16 stab wounds and 
a broken nose. He is 
currently recovering 
from these injuries. The researchers wife was physi
cally unharmed.
According to Carnegie Mellon Chief of Police Jim 
LaPaglia, there is a possibility the two incidents are 
related, no doubt about it.
The student was walking along Forbes Avenue around 
1:45 am Thursday morning, hoping to encounter the 
Escort van to get a ride to campus. He was suddenly 
jumped by two black men, beaten up, stabbed, and 
forced into a red two-door compact car driven by an
other black male. The car was driven to the intersection 
of Walnut Street and South Aiken Avenue while the 
student was repeatedly stabbed, beaten, and verbally

Rising labor costs spur self-service in Kiltie
By RACHEL GARB
Tartan Staffwriter
Carnegie Mellon Dining Serv
ice implemented an experimen
tal self-service system last week 
in one of Kiltie Cafes cafeteria 
lines.
The self-service is a response to 
economic trends that have in
creased labor costs for CMDS. 
In the past few years, food costs 
have been relatively stable, said 
CMDS Director James Gurley, 
while labor costs have in
creased.
Labor costs have become a big 
problem, said Erick NakaMizrahi, chair of the Student 
Dormitory Councils Food Com
mittee. Dining Service is look"In the past few years, food costs

number of employees needed to 
get out the food.
This is certainly new and its a 
very spontaneous [change], said 
Naka-Mizrahi. But Kiltie will be 
totally changed for next semester, 
when it is divided into three din
ing areas.
We had been looking at a selfserve system for a number of 
years, Gurley said. We decided 
that the remaining five weeks in 
the semester would serve as a 
trial period for self-service. We 
hope to learn a lot, especially in 
preparing for the new all-you-caneat facility in the new dorm next 
year.

Several Soviet scientists and U.S. secu

students from colleges throughout the MidAtlantic states last weekend for a regional 
conference held at Carnegie Mellon by 
Student Pugwash USA.
The conference, titled Global Security: A

by the recent changes in Eastern Europe 
and the worlds growing environmental

Indira Nair, associate department head

expand the thinking of her students through 
the Pugwash conference. My hope was to 
spend two days of concentrated time think

SEI, SCS unveil MS in software 
engineering for next fall
Students will be able to earn a masters degree in software 
engineering starting next fall in a new program that will be 
offered as a joint venture of Carnegie Mellons Software Engi
neering Institute and School of Computer Science.
The program will be headed by SEIs education program 
director, Norman E. Gibbs, who also directs software engineering 
education for SEI.
Carnegie Mellons software engineering program will be the 
thirteenth such program in the country. Gibbs said that most of 
the existing programs were tailor-made to meet the needs of local 
companies and lack a recognized, model curriculum.
The programs six core courses were developed at SEI and have 
been videotaped and used to enhance curricula of programs at 
more than 20 other universities.
CFA publication assists

The publication is available to Fine Arts students from the 
College of Fine Arts Deans Office.
Senator surveys students on 
20 percent Activites Fee jump
IM Student Senator Scott Zucker is distributing a survey to 
students in an effort to assess student opinion on an increase in 
the Student Activities Fee. The increase, if implemented, would 
raise the amount that students pay to support campus organiza
tions from $40 to $50 per semester.
Zucker says that he is conducting the survey in an effort to 
determine if students benefit equally from the fee at its current 
.level or if the distribution of the fee is skewed so that a small 
number of students derive a disproportionately large benefit 
from the fee while a majority of students do not.
The survey asks the participant to indicate how often he or she 
uses the campus media, attends AB events, or participates in 
other Activities Fee funded events or activities.

U.S. makes 
progress in trade 
talks with Japan
WASHINGTON (D J)  Treas
ury Department Undersecretary 
for International Affairs David 
Mulford said the Bush admini
stration has only accomplished 
half its mission in pursuing more 
open Japanese financial markets.
Mulford, coming under heavy 
criticism from several Senate 
Banking Committee members for 
the glacial pace of negotiations, 
said the U.S. is seeking faster 
interest rate deregulation and 
development of a short-term 
money market.
But to meet those and other 
goals, negotiators must break 
down a combination of laws, regu
lations, conventions, and prac
tices that discriminate against 
foreign firms, Mulford said.
Arguing that progress has been 
made in several areas, Mulford 
noted Japan recently promised to 
expand to foreigners use of the 
auction process in the government
securities market, to accept ap
plications for investment trust 
management licenses, and to 
increase seats on the Tokyo Stock 
Exchange.
There may not be many for
eign firms, particularly lately, 
that want access to the Tokyo 
exchange, he said. But our ac
complishments are not just 
crumbs.
That was exactly how Senator 
Jake Gam, the committees rank
ing Republican, described the con
cessions won so far by the U.S.
Someday there has to be some
body down at Treasury who wakes 
up, Gam (R-Utah) said, telling 
Mulford that Treasury has in
sisted for more than a decade that 
progress is being made.
Soviet official 
comments on 
talks, Germany
WASHINGTON (AP)  Last 
Friday, the Soviet Union with
drew its demand that a reunified 
Germany be neutral. As Foreign 
Minister Shevardnadze and Presi
dent Bush prepared for a summit 
the Soviet official predicted it will 
become a major event in world 
affairs.
After a two-hour session at the 
White House, Shevardnadze pre
dicted a wide range of agreements 
at Bushs Washington summit 
with Soviet President Gorbachev 
beginning May 30.
Shevardnadze cautioned, how
ever, that it will take an addi
tional effort to fashion a treaty to 
cut long-range nuclear missiles 
in time to be initialed by the two 
leaders at the summit.
Shevardnadze told reporters 
agreements in preparation deal 
with arms control, trade relations, 
cooperation in science and space.
This summit certainly will 
become a major event in world 
affairs, Shevardnadze said. The 
two presidents will sign very 
important documents. 
Shevardnadze said Bush ques
tioned him about Soviet policy in 
the breakaway republic of Lithu
ania. We have a clear conscience, 
said the Soviet official.
Defending Moscows tactics in 
dealing with the independence
movement, Shevardnadze said it 
was important to maintain order 
in the midst of possible inter
ethnic clashes.
Turning to the reunification of! 
Germany, the Hnchpin in Europe! 
of NATO, the foreign minister took 
a conciliatory stance.
We have to look for a solution, 
a solution that would be accept
able to both NATO and the War
saw Pact, Shevardnadze said.
In another area of conciliation,! 
Shevardnadze said the Soviets! 
were willing to implement an 
agreement for direct flights ofi 
Jewish refugees to Israel provided 
Israel gave assurances they would 
not be settled in the occupied1, 
territories.
A Soviet official specified that! 
this means East Jerusalem as! 
well as the West Bank and Gaza.
He also held out the prospect of ! 
resuming normal diplomatic ties [ 
with Israel after a 23-year laptfe
 depending on the overall 
Middle East situation.
The foreign minister added, 
without elaboration: As for how 
the development will proceed 
further, well see.

threatens veto of 
discrimination bill
WASHINGTON (AP)  A Sen
ate committee approved a bill to 
combat job discrimination, but the 
Bush administration threatened 
to veto the measure it said would 
result in racial hiring quotas.
The reality is that we have had 
a retreat on civil rights and we

Bush pledges to 
protect Chinese 
students in U.S.
WASHINGTON (DJ)  President Bush pledged further pro

studying in the U.S. who fear 
persecution in China.
Bush promised to extend stu
dent visas for Chinese students 
until January 1, 1994. Many vi
sas were scheduled to expire in 
June. He also pledged to assist 
students whose passports may 
have been revoked by the Chi
nese government as punishment 
for suporting pro-democracy dem
onstrations in China last year.
Bush first ordered a series of 
protections for Chinese students 
in the U.S. last year, after the 
communist government in Bei
jing cracked down on student 
demonstrators for democracy. The 
crackdown was said to result in 
thousands of deaths, and some
student leaders were forced to 
flee the country.
Students studying in the U.S.

CMU considers software 
degree program in Japan
Software engineer
ing is basically pub
lic domain knowl
edge in the US, and 
no matter what we 
do we cant keep it 
solely for ourselves. 
 Jeffery Eppinger,; 
Transarc manager
continued from page 1
he said.
The basic structure of the program 
+rc,ould include a possible visiting rela..iaonship involving Carnegie Mellon 
instructors, as well as permanent posi
tions in Japan, according to Cyert.
, There are mixed feelings among 
faculty, however: Some have ex
pressed. interest, and some are very 
much opposed, said Cyert. 
nr One of the major reasons for opposi' 4tion is that software engineering is one 
'of the most important areas in which 
the U.S. still maintains a clear advan
tage over the Japanese. However some 
people, like Jeffery Eppinger, feel that 
nfear of losing this advantage through 
Tfthe proposed program is not valid. 
flol Eppinger is the manager of architec
ture for transaction processes at TranIsarc, a Pittsburgh based distributer of 
"systems software and spinoff of Camef
'.e Mellons and IBMs Information
echnology Center  the company re
sponsible for Carnegie Mellons An
drew File System. Software engineer
ing is basically public domain knowl
edge in the U.S., he explains, and no 
rmatter what we do we cant keep it 
solely for ourselves.
^.Eppingers argument is that the 
Japanese are going to eventually evolve 
p. software engineering, so the U.S. 
ought to establish its position now, 
before any other countries do or before 
Japan doesnt need outside help.
In addition, he feels that if the Uni
versity does its job of disseminating 
knowledge, then the U.S. will main
tain another area of comparative 
strength  education  and in addi
tion will benefit by way of attracting 
well-educated people to the country.
According to Cyert, his trip to Japan 
was to foster increased relationships 
with Japanese corporations and the 
Japanese community. The general
theme of the trip was to stress the need 
for cooperation between Japanese cor
porations and American universities 
in research, he said.
For the long run, he said, the world 
is better off in cooperation than in com
petition. The United States and Japan 
must cooperate.
Cyerts trip revealed yet another pos
sible venture involving the Japanese. 
A meeting with the chairman of Sony 
Corporation, Akio Morita, left Cyert 
with the impression that the company 
may move into a former Volkswagen 
plant in Westmoreland County.
The proposed television manufactur
ing facility could create approximately
2,000 jobs; yet in the immediate fu
ture, Cyert doesnt see this as having 
any direct effect on Carnegie Mellon. 
Of course, Cyert said, it may be an
other company to hire our students.
Cyert looks to the future however, 
and in it he sees the possibility that the 
move may lead to some research rela
tionships. But overall, Cyert thinks 
that the move would help improve the 
economy, and anything that makes 
Pittsburgh strong is good for Carnegie 
Mellon.
Pugwash hosts global conference

being multiplied. He asserted that nu
clear testing by either of the superpow
ers should be ended immediately and 
prohibited in the future. [The 
committees] official position is that it 
must be stopped, he declared.
Sayamov expressed great interest in 
the Bush-Gorbachev summit coming in 
May. There are big hopes in our coun
try, he noted. Let it not be a reverse 
movement to the times of cold war and 
confrontation. The people want to live a 
normal life, not under the danger of a 
nuclear death.
According to Sayamov, part of the 
poisoned land around the Chernobyl 
nuclear plant will be given to Soviet 
scientists to be used as a field of re
search. At Chernobyl, we have a real 
result of nuclear devastation to work 
with, he commented.
Sayamov maintained that Gorbachevs 
perestroika policies have aided the work 
of Soviet scientists in all fields. Per
estroika facilitates our work very much, 
he said.
We know now the Soviet Union is not pushing all of its scientists toward military re
search. 
 Indira Nair, associate head 
Engineering and Public Policy
However, Sayamov did not feel that 
Gorbachev has received enough input 
from the scientific community. On the 
other hand, Gorbachev is in need of bet
ter scientific advice, he added.
Gorbachevs new Presidential Advisory 
Committee contains three Soviet scien
tists.
Nair expressed surprise over the 
glasnost of Sayamovs address. We 
usually think of the Soviet Union as 
opposite, said Nair. It was nice to know 
that they have a committee of scientists 
like our Federation of American Scien
tists that works together for the benefit 
of society.
Nair believes that Sayamov dispelled 
some stereotypes of the Soviet scientist. 
We know now the Soviet Union is not 
pushing all of its scientists toward mili
tary research, remarked Nair.
Rosenblum enjoyed seeing a scientist 
achieving political significance in the 
Soviet Union. I think it was neat to see 
a person in science and technology have 
a greater say in the political structure of 
the Soviet Union, said Rosenblum.
Also, I think it was really neat to see 
someone who is going to move up in the 
Soviet political structure as an advisor 
to the Politburo in the next four or five 
years, he said.
Rising labor costs spur Kiltie self-service

But Naka-Mizrahi said that Gurley 
hadnt discussed any plans for the new 
dorm withhim. We havent really talked 
about how the new dorm or about Skibo 
[next yearl with regards to self-service, 
he said. Ameetingis scheduled later this 
week in which the SDC Food Committee 
will discuss plans for the new dining 
facility with Gurley.
In the new dining hall, he added, I 
dont expect something like this.
One benefit of self-service, according 
to Gurley, is that students are not lim
ited to only one entree or portion at a 
time. People often complain that its 
silly to make them go through the line 
again when they already know that they 
want more than one entree, he said.
In addition, Gurley sees some benefits 
for workers. In the Tartan Grill and
"In the new dining hall, I dont expect some
thing like this. 
 Erick Naka-Mizrahi, 
SDC Food Committee chair
Salads Plus, where there is a combina
tion of self-serve and servers, we have 
found that attendants are more acces
sible and can better respond, to other 
concerns such as bringing out food and 
supplies and cleaning spills, he said.
But Naka-Mizrahi said that comments 
he has heard so far are mixed. There 
have been some complaints about serv
ice, he said. Ive spoken with the man
ager of the Kiltie Cafe and voiced some 
negative comments that Ive heard.
Naka-Mizrahi said that most of the 
complaints he heard were from students 
who had concerns about how food was 
being replaced or how the area was being 
kept clean. He said other students also 
complained about the lunchtime policy 
of having one line serve hot foods and the 
other act as a deli line only.
Gurley is pleased with the results so 
far. We see this change as being a fine 
tuning, he said, not something with 
major impact.
City abandons plans to tax 
universities research dollars

A recent decision by city offi
cials to explore the possibilities of 
imposing a six-mill tax on research 
grants received by colleges and 
universities has been abandoned, 
according to City Finance Directofc Ben Hayllar.
The tax, which would affect 
cKiefly Carnegie Mellon and the 
University of Pittsburgh, would 
have cost the two universities $1.6 
million dollars in the fiscal year 
qding in June, according to The 
Pittsburgh Press, which reported 
that Pitts research contracts to
taled $143.2 million in fiscal 1989 
aifdthat Carnegie Mellons grants 
^totaled $120.7 million. Pitt and 
jC^megie Mellon are the only 
universities in Pittsburgh which 
participate in large-scale spon
sored research.
According to A1 Brannick, 
CljlUs senior vice president for 
egal affairs, the city would have 
Mt more revenue by implement
ing the tax than it would have 
brought in.
We are legally tax exempt and 
I would vigorously oppose any 
iSort to cheat on that, said Presi
dent Richard M. Cyert. Taxing 
research would reduce the 
Universitys ability to function as 
fyajor economic generator. 
tytost of the research money 
rtiich Carnegie Mellon and Pitt 
Meive is from major government 
agencies. According to Hayllar, it 
unclear whether or not govern

kxed.

eluding the Pitt Stadium, have 
recently had their tax-exempt 
status challenged. Among area 
properties which were challenged 
is the site owned by Carnegie Mel
lon and occupied by WQED.
The property which is occupied 
by WQED is the only CMU prop
erty to be affected by the removal 
of tax-exempt status. Carlow and 
Chatham Colleges also own one 
piece of property each which would
be affected by the change in status; 
Pitt was most affected by the 
appeals, since 29 of its currently 
tax-exempt properties are up for 
re-evaluation.
The city and county have said 
they will re-examine the status of 
these properties because the prop
erties are used to generate a profit 
and [dont] fulfill the charitable 
mission of the organizations, 
according to the Press.

'abused. He was also forced to give up his 
wallet.
! At this intersection, the driver of the 
car got out and attempted to use the 
students MAC card. The assailant in the 
passenger seat moved into the drivers 
seat and began to drive the car around 
the block. The student pushed the pas
senger seat forward, leaned forward, 
grabbed the drivers glasses, and at
tempted to steer the car into oncoming 
traffic. However, the driver of the car 
{steered the car into a side street.
\ According to the student, he didnt 
Attempt to escape until one of the assail
ants told him that he was loading a gun. 
*1 didnt believe him at first, he said, but 
he began to struggle when [he] heard 
metal clicking on metal.
; After the car drove onto the side street, 
j;he student attempted to open the door 
nd escape. In the ensuing struggle, 
during which the student was again 
stabbed and beaten repeatedly, the stu
dent opened the door twice, only to have 
it closed by the attackers. On the third 
try, he was able to grab the top of the door 
$nd haul himself out of the car. He then 
ran like hell, finally making his way to 
a home on Copeland Street, where the 
owner of the house called the police.
There was a lot of blood... I bled all over 
their porch, he said. He was taken to 
Shadyside Hospital, treated, and pro
nounced to be in good condition.
Though he was stabbed a total of 16 
times and had his nose broken, none of 
the injuries were serious. It was an XActo knife, or a pin knife, said the stu
dent, now recovering at home. The 
wounds didnt rupture any internal or
gans. He should be well by Spring Car
nival.
One of the assailants was described as 
a black male, 5 10, in his twenties, with 
glasses, and having a medium to heavy 
build and short, dark hair. The other was 
described as a black male, in his 20s, thin 
build, 61 to 62, with dark, short hair. 
He was wearing a light-colored shirt and 
blue jeans. The student was unable to 
get a good look at the driver, but he 
seemed older ... he had a deeper voice.
In another kidnapping incident, the 
wife of a Japanese MEMS researcher 
was crossing Forbes Avenue to the Skibo 
parking lot, when a brown Buick or Oldsmobile stopped beside her. The door 
opened, and a black female grabbed her 
and pulled her into the car. The car 
proceeded down Forbes Avenue, made a 
right onto Bellefield, and took another 
right onto Centre Avenue. The car drove
down Centre Avenue to South Aiken, 
where it turned onto the 400 block. 
During the trip, the assailants demanded 
her money and credit cards.
While the car was parked at the me
ters on the 400 block of South Aiken, she 
jumped out of the car and ran across the 
street.
She tried to get help from the driver of 
a car stopped at the intersection of South 
Aiken and the Boulevard of the Allies, 
but the driver would not help her.
She then ran across the street and into 
the showroom of Don Allen Chevrolet, 
where an employee of the dealership 
contacted her husband, who picked her 
up.
The driver of the car was described as 
a black male, over 30, clean shaven, with 
short curly hair, and a thin face. The 
other assailant was described as a black 
female, 25-30,5 2, with a medium build; 
gelled, processed hair, medium length in 
the back and short on top; a bulky, black 
cloth waist jacket; and a dirty appear
ance. The vehicle was described as a four 
or five year old dark brown Oldsmobile 
or Buick four-door, with a light brown 
ulterior.
Both incidents happened on Forbes 
Avenue, and in both cases the victims 
were abducted, forced into a car, and
asked for credit cards, MAC cards, and 
money. As there was no positive identifi
cation of the driver in the first incident, 
it could have been the same driver, 
according to LaPaglia.
In two further incidents, a Carnegie 
Mellon student was mugged, and an
other was the victim of a scam.
The mugging victim was walking down 
Fifth Avenue around 1:45 am, and took a 
right onto Devonshire Avenue. On the 
opposite end ofthe sidewalk was a black 
male, wearing a black, waist-length 
leather jacket, and a bean cap. He was 
whistling and singing, I love to walk. 
The student crossed the street, hoping 
to make a U-tum, and [headed] back 
towards CMU.
However, the man crossed the street 
and cut him off. He pulled a knife out of 
his jacket pocket, and said Hey, have 
you got a match. The student turned, 
and began to back up towards Fifth 
Avenue. He took out his wallet, took out 
all the money he had  $40  and kept 
backing up.
The student returned to Morewood 
Avenue, where he encountered a Carne
gie Mellon Security officer, who contacted 
the Pittsburgh Police. The student was 
surprised by the attack, he said, because 
it was close to a well-lighted area. He
also noted that the attack was weird, 
like [the attacker] wasnt quite sure he 
was going to do it.
In yet another incident, a Carnegie 
Mellon student was the victim of a scan 
The student was approached by t\yp 
people posing as FBI officers investigat
ing counterfeit money. They convinced 
the student to withdraw $200 from .a 
MAC machine. After further harassment', 
the victim called the police.
One assailant was described as a black 
male, around 45 years of age, 5 7, 
wearing a dark baseball cap, a sport coat 
with a security guard sleeve insignia,.a 
gold badge, light blue short pants, arid 
black shoes. He was left-handed, drovea 
light-colored, older car, and identified 
himself as Officer Benson #177.
The other assailant was described as a 
black female, in her early 20s, 5 3, with 
a thin build, short hair (possibly shaveji 
on the right side), and black eyes. Stye 
was wearing a tee shirt, a flared maroon 
skirt, heavy make-up, and pink lipstick.'
The Carnegie Mellon Police, when 
asked for comment, stressed that stu
dents should use the shuttle service, 
instead of walking home alone. They will 
also set up a crime prevention education 
course for foreign students, in order t'tf 
help them in the future.
Crime and Incident Report
3/23 DISOR
DERLY CON
DUCT, 4:45 pm.
Campus Police re
sponded to a com
plaint that a disor
derly customer in the Margaret 
Morrison Laundry was causing 
problems. The customer told 
Campus Police that he had 
brought in 42 shirts to be laun
dered and only received 39 when 
he came back to pick them up. An 
employee told the man that the 
laundry was measured by weight, 
not by number of garments. She 
said that the customer began to 
scream and curse rather than 
discuss the discrepancy. The 
employee then gave the man the 
name and phone number of her 
supervisor and said that the dis
crepancy would be investigated. 
The customer continued his ti
rade. Campus Police advised him 
that in the future he should con
tact the manager to resolve any 
problems rather than upset the 
personnel waiting on him.
3/25 MEDICAL, 8:55 am. A 
Carnegie Mellon student said that 
after mixing up some expandable 
foam insulation and placing it in 
a container, the lid popped off, 
showering his face, arms, chest, 
and head with insulation. He was 
not sure whether or not insula
tion had gotten into his eyes. He 
flushed out his eyes with sterile 
water and was then transported 
by Campus Police to Eye and Ear 
Hospital.
3/26 UNSOLICITATED LIT
ERATURE, 4:11 am. A Carnegie 
Mellon staff member reported to 
Campus Police that someone had 
left a chain letter underneath his

for good luck.
3/26 THEFT, 12:04 pm. Per
sons unknown removed a micro
wave oven from Porter Hall B-33.
3/26 EXPLOSION, 8:02 pm. A  
Carnegie Mellon graduate stu
dent who had been working on an 
experiment in Mellon Institute 
had improperly mixed a combina
tion of chemicals. When properly 
mixed, the chemicals should cre
ate a certain amount of heat over 
a six hour period. However, an 
extreme amount of heat and pres
sure resulted after only one hour, 
causing an explosion.
3/27 THEFT, 10:10 am. While 
on the third floor of Wean Hall, a 
Carnegie Mellon staff member 
noticed two individuals standing 
by the freight elevator. They 
looked nervous upon seeing the 
staff member in the hallway and 
left quickly rather than wait for 
the elevator. The staff member 
immediately proceeded to her 
office and noticed that the lower 
left-hand drawer of her desk was 
open approximately two inches. 
Upon checking her purse, she 
found that certain articles had 
been removed. When the report
ing officer came to Wean Hall to 
record the incident, an unknown 
male who had become aware of 
the incident entered the staff 
members office and said that two 
males fitting the description she 
had given were seen entering a 
main elevator, apparently look
ing for a way out of the building. 
A check of the premises and sur
roundings proved negative.
3/27 VANDALISM, 9:49 pm. 
Someone reported that the card 
reader receptacle box at the rear 
ofthe Mellon Institute fourth floor 
library had been tampered with. 
Two screws had been removed
and the wiring had been discon
nected. The complainant did not 
realize that the said box was loose 
until a worker attempted to gain 
entry with his card and the whole 
inside slid out.
3/30 SUSPICIOUS PERSON, 
7:29 pm. Campus Police were 
contacted by a man who said that 
he had almost hit a woman who 
had been walking in the middle of 
Forbes Avenue. According to the 
man, the woman had a glazed 
look in her eye and was talking to 
herself. A Campus Police officer 
discovered the woman at Forbes 
and Beeler. When the reporting 
officer attempted to restrain the 
female, she started to run. The 
officer had to catch and physi
cally restrain the female. He tried 
to find out about her well-being, 
but the female was uncoopera
tive. The female also said that she 
had rights. The female was iden
tified as a Pitt student by her 
student ID. She said that she was 
fine and that there were no prob
lems. She was released and 
walked towards Squirrel Hill.
3/31 SOLICITATION, 10:45 
am. A Resident Assistant received 
a phone call from a person who 
asked him if he smoked pot. When 
he replied negatively, he heard a 
voice in the background say, hang
up. The actor hungup the phone. 
The RA said that this is the first 
incident of this type which he has 
experienced.
4/4 SUSPICIOUS PERSONS, 
4:05 am. An American Building 
Maintenance employee called 
Campus Police after discovering 
three males in the boiler room of 
the gym. The employee asked the 
males what they were doing; at 
first the actors didnt know what 
to say, but then one of them said 
that they were headed for a game 
and had gotten lost. The employee 
took them upstairs to call Cam
pus Police. While he was on the 
phone with Campus Police, the 
actors asked to step outside for a 
smoke, but they were told to 
remain inside. The actors then 
ran out the door and headed for 
Schenley Park. A search of the 
Park by Carnegie Mellon Police 
failed to discover the actors.
4/5 THEFT/RECOVERY, 4:30 
am. Campus Police were notified 
that there was a computer on the 
steps of Warner Hall. Campus 
Police confirmed the presence of a 
computer on these steps. The com
puter was returned to the B-level 
hallway of UCC, where it had 
been stored.

process. There was a small con
cern that not enough groups on 
campus were informed about the 
openings in AB. This concern 
arose from the predominance of
Greeks applying. This is not to 
say that a high percentage of

Officials laud Mehrabian
continued from page 1
brought the vision to build a 
new college to UCSB.
Mehrabian is credited with 
taking the helm of what Fac
ulty Search.Committee Chair 
John Fetkovich called a mediocre-at-best engineering 
school and building it to na
tional prominence.
One of [Mehrabians] most 
striking accomplishments was 
decreasing the faculty-to-student ratio at UCSB, says Zelmanowitz. He also had a great 
deal of concern for the curricu
lum.
Mehrabian has said that he 
plans to concentrate on under
graduate education when he 
comes to Carnegie Mellon. Of
ficials at UCSB saythatMehrabian was key in building a 
quality faculty there.
He developed a new, mod
em curriculum, said Zelmanowitz.
Engineering students here 
have a major breadth require
ment that is designed to get en
gineers out of engineering
classes, said Hynes.
But classes arent the only as- - 
pect of student life with which - 
Mehrabian is concerned.
He was extremely generous -' 
with funding to student organi-11 
zations, said Hynes. He is" 
really open and willing to listen 
to student concerns.
Attracting the best quality - 
students is essential to a re- - 
search university, said Hynes. 
Robert Mehrabian knows 
that.
He is greatly concerned that 
resources should go to help stu
dents, Zelmanowitz said.
But Mehrabian realizes that 
there will be elements ofhis job 
that go beyond the realm of student life. We cant borrow any 
more money, he said of Came-1 
gie Mellon.
Hynes thinks that Mehrabian * 
is up to the task. He created a 
fundraising operation from ' 
scratch and brought in really 
significant amounts, she said.
Were really sorry to see him 
go, she added. Youre really - 
lucky to have gotten him.

Mehrabian accepts Carnegie Mellon presidency
The following is the complete 
text of Dr. Robert Mehrabians 
address following the announce
ment of his election to the Carne
gie Mellon presidency by Douglas
D, Danforth, chair of Carnegie 
Mellons Board of Trustees. 
Mehrabians election was an
nounced on Thursday, at 10 am in 
the Skibo Ballroom.
Thank you very much. I want to 
first thank the Board of Trustees 
for selecting me and appointing 
me as president of the Univer
sity. It is a great honor for me and 
my family.
I want to take a few minutes 
first to describe my experiences 
with some of the people that I 
have encountered in the search 
process. Then I want to follow 
that up with just a few words 
about some directions that I hope 
we will take together.
I came to meet, first, the search 
committeevarious individuals 
in the search committee, John 
[Fetkovich], members of the fac
ulty, the student representative, 
and, of course, the staff represen
tative. I have served in many 
capacities in different universi
ties, but I have never encoun
tered a group of people who have 
had the loyalty and dedication 
that this group has displayed to 
ie. They have worked very hard. 
They have been very conscien
tious. They have done an out
standing job, not because they 
have selected me, but... because 
that too [laughter]... but because
yesterday  they would be kind 
of a support group for me during 
the transition between now and 
July 1. So that through them and 
through their eyes I can learn 
more about this great institution.
I want to say something about 
someone else on campus that 
hasnt really been recognized in 
the way I think he deserves to be 
recognized in this process. Hes a 
man whos decided to stop doing 
his present administrative duties 
and go back to teaching. I have 
asked him to stay with me for a 
transition period until we find an 
appropriate successor. And hes 
very, very graciously agreed to do 
so. And I want to recognize Angel 
Jordan, [applause]
There is no speech that can be 
made on this campus at this time, 
or any time in the future, without 
appropriate recognition of the 
man that has led this campus. It 
has been a wonderful experience 
watching President Cyert move 
this campus forward. I think Bob 
[Charpie, trustee search commit
tee chair and nominee for chair of 
Board of Trustees] mentioned it 
appropriately  he has taken a 
campus from a regional good 
university to a university that 
enjoys an international reputa
tion and is one of the jewels in the 
technical schools today.
I am very honored to be follow
ing in the footsteps of such a man, 
and I hope that the momentum 
and the direction that he set will 
be one that I can move to a new 
and higher plateau. He has prom[of how] they went about the ised me that hell help me in every 
grocess. I dont think there is a way possible and Im going to hold
person I have worked with the 
liast 25 or so years that has not 
teen contacted at one time or 
another [laughter].
 I want to thank all of you for the
work that _______________________
you have 
one, and I 
appreciate 
if. Ive 
a s k e d 
them  
this com
mittee is 
now dis
banded, of 
course  
but Ive 
asked the
committee to help me. Ive asked 
sme new members to join the 
committee. Specifically, two 
deans, Robert Sekerka [MCS 
dean], an old friend of mine, and 
Steve Feinberg [H&SS dean], also 
Granger Morgan [EPP head], and 
Pat Keating [vice president for 
University planning and business 
affairs]. And what Id like to call 
tltis group  I spoke with them
him to that promise. I want to 
thank Dick Cyert for all his help 
so far and I want to thank him for 
the help he is going to give me in 
the future, [applause]
______________________ Let me
say a few 
words 
about the 
future. At 
an event I 
met one of 
the alumni 
and it was 
amazing 
for me. Her 
name was 
Anna McCandless. 
She graduated from Carnegie 
Mellon in 1919. She has met ev
ery president that has been in 
charge of this campus. She had 
fallen and broken her hip and 
hadnt been out since September, 
and yet, yesterday, she came out 
to dinner with the trustees to meet 
the new president, and I was 
touched by that. It shows that the 
kind of care and the kind of devo
Our students need a 
different kind of train
ing. They need 
broader training.
 Robert Mehrabian, 
president-elect
tion to this campus that the 
alumni can have. Doug Danforth 
asked her the real question. He 
said, Anna, what did it cost to 
attend this campus when you were 
a student? And she said, Fifty 
dollars. [laughter] There was 
somebody very kind at the table 
who said, But those were very 
large dollars. [laughter]
The three items I want to touch 
on about the future are very brief. 
I think there is a process we have 
to set in place. The process is 
going to be strategic planning, 
but it is going to be strategic plan
ning heavy on implementation 
and not very heavy on promises 
and expectations. So we will plan, 
but we will plan with goals, and 
Im a firm believer in milestones, 
milestones that you meet, mile
stones that you have to meet on a 
timely basis before you set new 
goals. So there will be a process 
that will be put together some
time after I come.
In the interim, though, I thought 
you may want to know at least 
three items that are on my mind. 
One, of course, education. I want 
to say a couple words about that. 
Second, research, and third  
last, but not least  resources.
In the education component, we 
are entering a new era. The world 
is shrinking, the world is chang
ing. Weve been in a century of 
creative endeavors, a century of 
discovery  tremendous discov
ery  and yet a century of tre
mendous conflict. With what is 
happening in the world today, 
there is some hope that the con
flict will subside.
But the time of discovery and 
creativity is going to continue. 
Our students need a different kind 
of training. They need broader 
training. Those that are in the 
sciences and technologies need 
training in other areas than just 
sciences and technologies. They 
have to be sensitive citizens, 
sensitive about the environment, 
sensitive about other cultures, 
sensitive about world affairs, and 
knowledgeable about the global 
environment in which they are 
going to have to perform, [ap

We owe it to our students to 
build for them an environment 
they can be creative in, that they 
can have recreational facilities 
in. I think our facilities right now 
are rather modest. I am commit
ted to building the University 
Center, [applause] Not just for 
the students, but for the staff and 
faculty as well.
I believe that their educational 
process can be emphasized in the 
way that weve emphasized the 
research process recently. That

doesnt mean that we wont em
phasize the research process and 
the research endeavors in the 
future, but I believe we can make 
our undergraduate education 
especially and our graduate edu
cation a particularly important 
aspect of the next ten years. I 
think that with embarking on this 
activity, we are embarking on a 
road together in which I am going 
to need all the input from the 
faculty, the staff, and especially 
the students themselves. Ive met 
with them several times. Ive met 
with them first thing this morn
ing, though Ill apologize, I was a 
little late. I met with them first 
thing this morning and Ive al
ready begun a dialogue with the 
students to begin to understand 
what their concerns are about 
their habitat and their educa
tional experiences.
Ive also met with the staff this 
morning. They are very impor
tant to the university. They are 
the glue that holds the frame
work together, and Im going to 
again work with them and be very 
concerned with their needs and 
aspirations. Some of those aspi
rations are education, and we have 
to be cognizant of those facts.
Let me say something about 
research. There is no question 
that this university has been 
successful in research. What has 
happened on this campus is mi
raculous. Computer science, en
gineering, and the sciences  
wonderful. But we shouldnt for
get that there is a strong tradi
tion of the fine arts and humani
ties on this campus. Some of the 
best known departments, nation
ally and internationally, are out
side the sciences and technolo
gies. Ill give you the example of 
drama. Drama is one of the best 
departments in the country. If 
you want the humanities and 
social sciences, Ill give you the 
example of psychology  a de
partment which is absolutely topnotchabsolutely. These depart
ments and colleges are going to 
play important roles, not just in 
our teaching, but in our creative 
efforts in the research enterprise.
You know what is happening. A 
lot of our money comes from the 
Department of Defense  my 
money back in Santa Barbara, 
some of your money here. I think 
the predictions of doom for those 
research dollars are incorrect, but 
there is one thingfor certain, they 
are not going to increase, and 
they are most probably going to 
decrease. So we have to worry 
about other research activities.
Fortunately, there are many 
problems we can address. These 
are issues which are close to the

hearts and minds of the Ameri
can people. There are issues that 
deal with the environment, there 
are issues that deal with safety, 
safety in plants, nuclear plants 
and chemical plants. There are 
issues that deal with our competi
tiveness today in manufacturing, 
where we can build close ties 
between our management school, 
GSIA, and the technical commu
nity on campus. There are issues 
which deal with problems in our 
cities. There are many things 
which we can work on, and fortu
nately, the talent base which is 
available on this campus and in 
this community is uniquely poised 
to address those problems. So we 
have to work together, not just sit 
back here until somebody in 
Washington decides what are the 
important issues to work on, but 
be out there helping make the 
decision as to where resources 
should go to address some of these 
problems. Talent exists on this 
campus and we can do that to
gether.
I want to finish with a note 
about resources. Its a difficult 
time for all universities in the 
United States, especially private 
universities. Resources are scarce. 
The university has dealt, dealt 
very successfully, but we have a 
resource problem. We can only 
raise so much from research and 
there is a limit to what we can 
charge for tuition. There has to be 
some other funds. We have to 
raise it from the alumni. We have 
to get their help. We have to get 
the trustees, and Bob [Charpie] 
has already promised me that hes
going to work very hard on that. 
Now, we are going to need thestudents, the staff, and the fac
ulty  we need to energize the ; 
alumni  do you know there are
12,000 alumni within 50 miles of 
this hall, and we have to energize 
them, we have to get them inter
ested in this campus. And I think 
some of the initiatives well have i 
vis-a-vis education might just be I 
the right approach. We have to 
get help from the alumni all over 
the country. We also have alumni  
in foreign countries and I need - 
your help. This is not something - 
that any one person could possi- - 
bly do. I need the help of the 
faculty, I need the help of the 
staff, and I certainly need the ' 
help of our students.
We are, you and I, embarking 
on a new journey together near ' 
the end of a very exciting century. ' 
We can move to the next century 
with success built on the things 
that Dick Cyert and the faculty' 
here have built already, move to a  
new and higher plateau, and we ' 
have to do that together. I am " 
ready to begin. I hope you will join 
me in this endeavor. The road is - 
not going to be easy, but it is going - 
to be a lot of fun.
To finish, I would like my wife,  
Victoria, to come up here  even 
though she was already intro- : 
duced  and join me, and I want 
to introduce her myself. Come on : 
up. As you know  you may or 
may not, actually  I am of 
Armenian descent, 100 percent, . 
but fortunately for the two of us, . 
Victoria is half Scottish.
Thank you very much.

FORUM
Welcome to CMU, Dr. Mehrabian
You may be wondering why an 
editorial about something as im
portant as the naming of Carne
gie Mellons next president is so 
short. The answer, quite simply, 
is that we do not know Robert 
Mehrabian well enough yet to offer 
an informed opinion.
But we like what weve seen so 
far. Mehrabian seems to be an 
extremely competent leader and 
administrator with a lot of good 
ideas.
He also appears to be person
able and friendly. We get the idea 
that Mehrabian will be a presi
dent who students can talk to 
comfortably; we hope he will make 
himself available to students so 
that they can do just that.
All reports thus far have had 
only good things to say about 
RobertMehrabian, and werelooking forward to working with him.
Welcome to Carnegie Mellon, Dr. 
Mehrabian.
Japanese venture good for U.S., too
Carnegie Mellon may have an 
opportunity to establish a soft
ware engineering program in 
Japan. If businessman Nishi 
Ashiis proposal is accepted, CMU 
will receive $35 million toward 
establishing such an educational 
program.
Ashiis proposal would foster 
further research in software engi
neering. It would also further 
CMUs reputation and prestige. 
Yet not everyone on campus is 
happy about this possibility.
A mood exists, here and else
where in America, that the U.S. 
and Japan are fighting an eco
nomic war. Proponents of this 
argument feel that training Japa
nese professionals in software 
engineering puts Carnegie Meltpn in the same historical cate
gory as Benedict Arnold and 
Yidkun Quisling  traitors to our 
country.
We disagree. If anything, Japan 
.a,nd the U.S. are rivals, but not 
enemies. Knowledge gained in one 
Country flows into the other and
both countries and both peoples 
gain as a result.
Furthermore, the role of a uni
versity is to disseminate knowl
edge for the greater good of hu
manity, not simply for that of the 
U.S. The proposed program may 
eventually lessen our software 
exports, but it would represent an 
export of higher education, which 
is an even greater and longer last
ing American asset.
Some points of concern should 
be noted, though. Knowledge must 
not only go to Japan, it must also 
return to Carnegie Mellon. If a 
program is set up, it must be struc
tured to ensure that research 
performedin Japan is shared with 
researchers and students here and 
across the United States.
This idea is good for both coun
tries. Japanese companies will 
receive training and knowledge 
they currently do not have. Car
negie Mellon will expand and 
receive further prestige. And the 
world will gain more knowledge 
on an important subject.
Protect yourself from violent crime
If youre like most CMU stu
dents, youre probably pretty com
fortable about being anywhere on 
or around campus at any time.
In fact, you may be just a little 
too comfortable. While there arent 
usually many instances in which 
people are victims of violent crime 
in the areas on and around cam
pus, the events that transpired 
last week  two abductions, a 
mugging, and a scamseem more 
natural on TV than at CMU.
As major cities go, Pittsburgh 
has a relatively low crime rate. 
However, this area is not crimefree. Anyone can be a victim, male 
or female, student or professor.
Simple precautions can be taken 
to minimize the risks inherent 
with attending an urban campus. 
Stick to the major streets, espe
cially at night, when side roads 
are not well-lit. Beware of slowmoving cars. Use the shuttle and 
escort service when possible. 
Avoid people who approach you 
whom you do not recognize.
We realize this sounds like your 
mother talking, but shes so far 
away we figured wed take her 
place this week. No one is inde
structible. Be alert. Everyone in 
the campus community needs to 
remember to avoid unnecessary 
risks.

Letter to 
the Editor
Editor:
After reading the 
article in the Tartan 
about the FCE [Uni
versity releases re
sults of Faculty Course 
Evaluations, 3/20], I felt that I must 
comment. The article mentioned that 
Professor Wyler was one of the profes
sors who received an average rating 
below 2.0 on the FCE last semester. 
This does not surprise me at all. I was 
one of the .unfortunate students who
was forced to endure Professor Wyler for 
a semester in Algebraic Structures.
Professor Wyler was without question 
the worst professor I have had at CMU. 
He was frequently late for class. His 
classes habitually ran 10 minutes over 
and he was never prepared. He would 
assign homework problems off of the top 
of his head without even looking at them, 
and on at least one occasion announced 
that one of the assigned problems was too 
difficult to solve. When you add in the fact 
that he took almost 6 weeks to hand back
the first test of the semester, it becoffies 
easy to see why his rating was so low?
Other students and I have tried-io 
speak to Russ Walker about Wyler. The 
response that we' got was, Oh, wellf I 
cant do anything about it. The fact th&t 
people like Oswald Wyler continue" to 
teach at this University confirms tKht 
CMU really is not concerned about ihe 
quality of undergraduate education.!^

Letter to 
the Editor
became clear to me as I realized how 
others might view such an activity. This 
is not in response to the article Investi
gation Uncovers no Hazing at ATO [3/

realization that actions such as indecent 
exposure or rude gestures towards traffic 
are inexcusable regardless of whether 
there was malicious intent or not. The 
individuals involved have all been repri
manded accordingly. They have had their 
chapter voting rights suspended, written 
letters of apology to all parties involved, 
and will be participating in community 
service projects. It is my hope that indi
vidual punishments of this magnitude
will help them realize that their actions 
were immature, offensive, and not repre
sentative of ATO. On behalf of tfie 
members of ATO, I humbly apologize/or 
the actions of these individuals. As^a 
result of the repercussions and the nega
tive connotations involved with this 
event, Repa will be discontinued.

Naval ROTC highly worthy of respect
o
Letter to the Editor
Editor:
Being one of the 
most visible groups on 
campus, NROTC and 
its Midshipmen are 
not getting the respect 
they deserve. The NROTC Scholarship 
is rated as being one of the toughest 
scholarships.to receive due to the strenu
ous competition and overall expected 
level of excellence. These proud few, 
who have made positive career goals to 
serve our nation, know that if it came 
down to it, they would lay down their 
lives in battle. NROTC Midshipmen,
not only having to adhere to a rigorous 
physical and academic schedule, have to 
endure the ignorant comments and re
marks of those who have no inkling of 
what they are talking about.
NROTC has a mission. It includes asr 
sisting the Midshipmen education; pro
viding fundamentals to establish sound 
bases for living; preparing them for serv
ice with honor, integrity, leadership skills, 
and a sense of loyalty and dedication; pre
paring them for advanced education; and 
injecting values of civilian higher educa
tion into the armed forces. They have no 
wish to convert CMU into a training camp
for militant, gun toting maniacs, and,j;p 
stereotype them as such is sophomorjc. 
They are normal people doing what they 
feel is the best for themselves and their { 
country. - u
NROTC is a program that CMU should 
be very proud of. They have represented 
CMU well, not only in Drill Competi
tions, but also in the community as weE

o*
Letter to 
the Editor
Editor:
Im writing this let
ter to show another 
side of the coin (so to 
speak) of Mr. Slaters 
suit against the city of 
Pittsburgh. Here is a man who thinks 
that because he was a police officer in a 
county in Georgia he has the right to 
move here and become one in Pitts
burgh. Sorry Mr. Slater, but it doesnt 
work that way! You claim that the 1975 
quota system act is the reason you are 
not getting hired? I think not!
First of all, your score of 94 is really an 
84 (minus 10 points for Veterans Pref
erence, which really saved your score J. 
Your score stinks for being a former 
police officer! In the article [Guard 
battles Pittsburgh in court, 3/20], you 
acted like you scored a 94 all on your 
own. Im responding because it showed 
you are all very ignorant and dont have 
all the facts. By having only your side of 
the story printed, people will think that 
the quota system is unfair!
My point is that I am a 25-year-old 
black male. I scored a 92 on the police 
Civil Service exam (no Veterans Prefer
ence points). I do not drink alcohol nor 
have I taken any type of drug in my 
entire life. I was bom in Pittsburgh and 
have lived here all my life. After high 
school, I worked steadily and was never 
fired from a job.
You were never called after the first 
exam; I was. I had to take three psycho
logical exams, one oral, and two written.
I describe myself as a person who wants 
a career, someone who can help make a 
difference where I live, who wants a good 
paying job with the chance for advance
ment, who loves to deal with people in 
good or bad situations, and a true God
fearing, Jesus-loving Christian. All of my 
background and former job checks were 
above average! I took a. drug test (which 
I passed), and had reference letters rang
ing from doctors to State Troopers.
Mr. Slater, I received a letter one week 
after all these exams. It stated that it was 
the Civil Service Commissions view that 
I was not suited for police work in the city 
of Pittsburgh. I called the Civil Service 
Commission and asked for a reason. They 
said they were not allowed to tell me!
Im trying to show you, quota system 
or not, you could have made it this far 
and still been turned down!
Why you do you not think your bonus 
10 points are fair? From my point of view, 
they are. If you want to be fair, everyone 
should start from zero. My other question 
to you is why Pittsburgh? Being Mr. Ex
perience, why didnt you apply to Penn 
Hills, Wilkinsburg, Dormont, or Forest 
Hills? All of these police departments 
were hiring, and all are in the Pittsburgh 
area. Why is only Pittsburgh the target?
Another point is when only making 
$6.46/hr., how can you afford five law
suits? Who is really booking you? Mr. 
Slater, didnt you ever wonder why out
side the city of Pittsbugh you hardly ever 
see black police officers? Its because police 
departments wont hire blacks unless they
have to! When Pittsburgh was the num
ber one city to live in, it wanted to keep 
that rating. If CMU were to rank firstln 
the nation, it would like to keep that) 
rating also. Then why, when it comes to 
hiring minorities, no one wants to be 
number one in that?!
Mr. Slater, you will never know what it! 
is like to be black. Be glad, because Ij 
dont think you could handle it. We are! 
stereotyped all the time. For example, 'if 
you are black and drive a nice car, it was! 
either stolen or you sell drugs. Or the' 
only other job youre supposed to have is 
being a custodian (which is what I am; 
right now), food service employee, or dope; 
dealer. So before you quote Dr. King,; 
know the meaning of the words you use.; 
I deal with racist people every day at| 
CMU and all over the city, and America! 
has not achieved Dr. Kings dream yet! !
In closing, I was trying to show you! 
that it is not the quota system that is< 
unfair, but how the Civil Service Com-; 
mission picks who they feel is right to be; 
a Pittsburgh police officer. The city coun- \ 
cilman in my area vowed to help me find! 
the reason why Im not being hired, and; 
if that does not work, I too will file a; 
lawsuit. Yet it will be aimed at the Civil I 
Service hiring procedures, not the quota * 
system. Black people have long been 
discriminated against, and the city with; 
its hiring quota has tried fairly to right J 
overdue wrongs!

Fascist cops rule students in Florida
I would like to welcome you all 
back from spring break, and also 
welcome our new president. I hope 
everyone enjoyed their break. Did 
you ever notice how Florida dur
ing spring break is almost like a 
fascist state? Its amazing.
I encountered my first narc the 
first night I was there. You see, 
the Daytona police decided to 
recruit college students to help 
them in their fight against the 
evil spring breakers. I was carry
ing two' beers back to my room 
when this guy, around my age, 
stops me. He must have just got
ten on the job, because I was able 
to confuse him rather well. Oh, 
well, this is for someone else. They 
just asked me to bring it over. So 
he gives me a warning and lets 
me go. Stupid college kids.
Yet some of my friends were not 
as lucky. One day, everyone was 
sitting on the patio, in the back of 
the hotel. You would be led to 
believe that since the hotel is 
rather a private area and they 
have security (rent-a-cops) to 
control situations, normal police 
would leave you alone. Well, no 
such luck. Two undercovers walk 
up to a group of people eating and 
drinking and ask for ID. Telling 
the truth, only two people were 
drinking underage at the table. 
But they didnt get carded. So two 
other underage people tell the 
police that they are underage and 
arent drinking, which they 
werent (at that time). Yet the
Rich Robinson
cops say, Well, this beer is in 
front of you, and start to give 
them citations for $110.
One of my friends asked for the 
cops badge, who refused to show 
it, saying that he was undercover. 
Mind you, the cop was being a 
dick, but my friend persisted and 
said, This is harassment. The 
cop just smiled and said No, this 
is jail time. Hands behind your 
back. He spent 5 hours in jail for 
attitude.
The rent-a-cops were also quite 
amazing. As long as one person 
was under 21, they could cite 
everyone in the room. What was 
scary was that these guys had 
guns. They would confiscate your 
beer, drink it, get drunk, and, 
once they had enough to drink, 
they made people pour out beers.
I encountered one of these drunk 
rent-a-cops. It was not fun. First, 
he harassed one girl over her 
choice of major. Then he told us 
that after 24 years, his wife 
walked in, asked for a divorce, 
then he gave it to her, which is 
why his kids can get Pell grants 
because they come from a broken 
home. He then insisted that some 
little Floridian school now costs 
$15,000 a semester. I, of course, 
said that was impossible and that
no school could cost that much in 
just tuition. Well, he didnt like 
being caught in a lie, so he starts 
yelling. He said I accused him of 
being a liar, and that I should 
never call anyone a liar, and if I 
wanted to finish things, I could 
step outside with him.
Yeah, sure, like Im going to go 
outside with an alcoholic rent-acop with a gun. Now I know why 
his wife divorced him.
Now, I couldnt understand why 
we were getting harassed so much. 
I consider the majority of CMU 
students to be rather responsible 
and controllable when drinking. 
We dont get out of hand and cause 
major trouble. Then I started 
meeting other people.
A friend and I went down to the 
major area of hotels that is the 
hub of spring break. You cant 
imagine what the idiots are like 
down there. Its as though half of 
them never got out of high school. 
Now Im not model for maturity, 
and if you knew me, you would 
appreciate what Im saying. These 
people were just dumb, uncon
trolled, irresponsible drunks who 
thought having a good time meant 
causing trouble. Im not saying 
everyone was like that, but at 
least half of the spring breakers 
were. And Im including women 
in that, too.
Its these people who give un
derage drinkers a bad name. But 
I still have a problem with the po
lice being so tough. First of all, its
not that tough to distinguish 
(something they did  how can 
they enforce it) between a bellig
erent drunk and someone who is 
relatively under control. Why 
bother the people who arent 
causing problems? Okay, theyre 
drinking illegally, yes. But there 
are a whole bunch of people caus
ing more trouble than they are, so 
why bother with the responsible 
person?
I have another point. I cannot 
understand how cops can enforce 
something that they have done as 
well. Im sure that almost every 
person in the U.S., with few ex
ceptions, has tried alcohol under
age. Now, if cops simply busted 
those people that were a problem, 
I would have less of a problem. 
But when they start coming into
a. hotel room to bust people who 
are under control, I say to go 
bother the people raising hell.
I suppose it all stems back to 
same argument about underage 
drinking. I personally dont be
lieve in 21 as the drinking age. If 
someone is being responsible, 
leave them the hell alone. Get the 
people causing trouble and teach 
them a lesson, but if you can 
handle it and be well behaved, I 
see no problem.
Well, I hope you all had a nice 
break. Again, welcome back and 
see you next week.

IM major.

Student search committee 
enthusiastic about Mehrabian
Letter to the Editor
Editor:
The Student Presi
dential Search Com
mittee would like to 
congratulate Dr.
Robert Mehrabian on 
his appointment to the Presidency of 
Carnegie Mellon University. As the rep
resentatives of the student body, we are 
enthusiastic about Dr. Mehrabians ap
pointment and the future of Carnegie 
Mellon under his leadership.
The search process was an arduous 
but rewarding experience for the com
mittee. We accomplished our two pri
mary objectives. First and foremost, we 
found a president sincerely interested in 
and responsive to student concerns. 
Second, we published a report that 
communicated to the candidates, trus
tees, faculty, and administration stu
dent views on the state of the University 
and our hopes for the future.
We would like to thank the members of 
the Trustee Search Committee, the 
Faculty Search Committee, and the 
Presidential Search Steering Commit
tee who made it possible for students to 
be involved at an unprecedented level. 
The entire Student Committee met with 
Dr. Mehrabian prior to his appointment 
and in addition, a number of students 
met with him on several other occasions. 
The discussions covered a wide range of 
topics related to the University, such as
undergraduate education, the Univer
sity Center, quality of life issues, and 
graduate student concerns.
We thank the campus community for 
understanding our insistence on confi
dentiality so as to maintain the integrity 
of the process and to ensure that we 
secured the best person possible for the 
Presidency of Carnegie Mellon Univer
sity. We hope that our diligence and ef
forts in this process lead to further stu
dent involvement in high-level decisions 
facing the University as well as in future 
searches for the leaders of Carnegie 
Mellon.
Dr. Mehrabians commitment to stu
dent participation in the advancement 
of the University makes us enthusiastic 
about the future of Carnegie Mellon 
under his leadership.

Club Med isnt all it was made out to be
So what is a hot weather-hating guy 
like myself supposed to do when his 
family decides they want to go to Club 
Med in Cancn for Spring Break?Find 
ways to keep myself preoccupied, of 
course.
Lying still on the beach with sticky 
grease smeared all over your body, 
waiting for the moment when your 
flesh has been sufficiently fried, has 
never been my idea of a good time. 
There are enough carcinogens in the 
world already, so I can do without skin 
cancer. But like the spirited guy Im 
not, I went into the sun and the beau
tiful ocean for a few hours and guess 
what? I got got a case of sun poisoning 
that had me vomiting, bedridden, and 
fever-stricken for a day, itching like 
mad the whole time.
Im not too fond of sports and though 
I love to draw, sketching by the pool in 
eighty-degree weather while glisten
ing buffoons in too-tight bathing suits 
gawk doesnt really thrill me. So I 
opted to spend a lot of my time sitting 
near the bar area listening to my ver
sion of beach music CHenry Rollins, 
Killdozer, and Sheer Terror) while 
catching up on my mail and working 
on my writing skills.
If you are as amused as I am by some 
of the pathetic individuals one could 
term The American nightmare, visIs Neal Peart your god? 
Marc Fischer
iting any beach front resort (or profes
sional wrestling event), then Club Med 
should satisfy your most warped desires 
to view these walking spectacles of apa
thy.
How could anyone fail to appreciate 
the bloated middle-aged men with the 
blurry American eagle tattoos that look 
like they were applied with a squeegee 
and the pitch black sun tans? Dont intel
lectuals of this caliber who find it hip to 
drape two-foot long necklaces of plastic 
yellow bar beads around their necks 
like theyre strands of gold make you feel 
proud to be an American?! Watch as one 
escorts his wife to the pool  two perfect 
future models for the swimsuit edition of 
Skin Cancer Illustrated.
Then there was the woman whose 
presence informed me that everyones 
favorite transvestite Divine may actu
ally be alive and well! Id swear to that 
lanky guy swinging from a cross that I 
saw the real Divine at a buffet lunch one 
afternoon. The lady was sporting short 
buzzed hair, a stripe of thick white make
up across the eyes for that late 70s New 
Wave look, huge plastic circular fluores
cent orange earrings (doubled up), 
and a hideous bright orange fruit 
patterned dress with a matching rolled 
headband. If ever there was a person 
who watched John The King of Bad 
Taste Waters amazing films like 
Hairspray, Female Trouble, and Des
perate Living for the potential fash
ion tips, this lady was the one.
I could go on all year with my char
acter studies but unfortunately I do 
not have the space. So in conclusion, 
did I enjoy my trip to Mexico over 
spring break? I guess so. I didnt 
partake in many of the activities Club 
Med provided for me, and I can say 
with pride that I didnt get a very 
thorough tan. But I did get the muchneeded opportunity to relax in some 
weather that was honestly pretty 
beautiful most of the time. I was also 
able to responsibly enjoy the lower 
drinking age (18 years old) without 
feeling the need to be drunk all week. 
I got some writing done, and I read a 
great book about some fictional serial 
murders called The Silence of the 
Lambs.
I suppose I could have found worse 
ways to spend my spring break in 
Mexico. I could have laid in the sun 
like a corpse every day.

The U.S. needs to end its condemnation of Israels actions
Recently, talk has arisen in 
Congress, between Democrats 
and Republicans alike, to curb 
military funding for Israel in light 
of the changes occurring through
out the world.
To my dismay, the State De
partment and members of the 
Bush administration feel that it 
would be important to curtail aid 
for several reasons; first, in agree
ment with Congress, which is in 
terms of reallocating funds to 
aspiring democracies in Eastern 
Europe, and second, on the spuri
ous desire for peace proffered by 
the PLO under Yassir Arafat.
Actually, I am not in total dis
agreement with the first reason, 
in support of Eastern democra
cies, but as far as the second rea
son is concerned, I am flabber
gasted.
To be blunt, since when has the 
PLO, and its subordinate factions, 
some of which are extremely vio
lent, militant, and uncontrollable, 
been a supporter of peace? Has it

ever? I really think not. In June, 
1982, when Israel entered Leba
non  according to some less-in
formed individuals, a horrific 
invasion  it was not to extend 
its influence or exert its power, 
but rather, to push the murder
ous PLO back into Lebanon.
Prior to the strategic military 
move into Lebanon, Israel sus
tained several mortar attacks by 
the PLO, killing Kibbutz mem
bers. Terrorist infiltration, spe
cifically by the PLO, was ram
pant, and when several schools 
were shot up, subsequently kill
ing several children, Israel had 
no choice but to push the PLO 
back.
Fortunately, they were rather 
successful. That is, of course, until 
world condemnation and pressure 
was strong enough to force Israel
grace of the Midshipmen.
NROTC, as do other ROTC 
groups on campus, stresses selfdiscipline, physical fitness, and 
leadership. I personally find noth
ing wrong with those traits being 
enforced in people. I just think 
that people should keep in mind 
that these Midshipmen are de
fending our way of life that allows 
people to turn around and slan
der them.
These people deserve recogni
tion for all their hard work:

to acquiesce and withdraw its 
forces. Of course, Israel did sus
tain many casualties which also 
expedited Israels departure. 
However, condemnation doesnt 
end there.
Currently, world attention is 
focusing on Israels handling of 
the Intifada in the West Bank 
and Gaza Trip. The Intifada is 
the uprising initiated by militant 
youths and other feckless mis
creants approximately 15 months 
ago.
At first, the Intifada attracted 
little attention. However, once the 
media had gotten wind of the 
uprising, the media, as usual, 
swarmed into the territories and 
began presenting an extremely 
one-sided and biased view of the 
problem.
Yet, the media did not mention 
the underlying circumstances 
surrounding the violence! For one 
thing, few members of the media 
wanted to discuss the fact that

when Israel was assaulted on 
nearly every front  from Syria, 
Jordan, Egypt, and other Arab 
states not too ecstatic with Israels 
existence  Israel captured the 
territories which are now the 
center for the uprising.
Now, after nearly 20 years of 
violence and terrorism against 
Israel, the PLO wants to don its 
sheeps clothing, or should I say a 
dove with peace offering in beak. 
Remember, it was Arafat and 
others like him, such as Hafez ElHassad of Syria, who stated that 
they wanted to see nothing less 
than the total eradication of Is
rael; in fact, the goal of the Arab 
armies during the 1967 and 1973 
wars was to push Israel into the 
sea.
But regarding military aid, the 
problems arent about to end for 
Israel. As I said before, talk has

by the U.S. during the 1967 and 
1973 wars as well as during the 
Reagan administration, Israel 
was able to miraculously impede 
attacks, and thus check Arab 
aggression.
The three billion dollars that 
the U.S. has given Israel over the 
past several years has resulted in 
many beneficial ramifications for 
the U.S. During the Lebanon 
debacle Israel supplied vital in
formation concerning Soviet-built 
tanks used by the Syrian army. 
When Syria deployed SAM (Surface-to-Air) missiles on the Grolan 
Heights, Israel supplied techni
cal data and strategic logistics 
concerning those very missiles. 
When Israel engaged Syrian and 
Jordanian MIG-23sandMIG-27s 
(Soviet fighter planes) the United 
States became the immediate and 
only benefactor.

Speaking of representing CMU 
well, the CMU NROTC Drill Team 
recently travelled to Villanova for 
a 3-day drill competition, where 
they placed second in the overall 
competition. 2nd overall is a 
strong showing for such a new 
unit. It just demonstrates the 
many hard hours these fellow 
Tartans put into their practices, 
and it really pays off at competi
tions.
These people deserve our admi
ration. They are not the cause of 
war. They are the prevention.
We should not neglect Israel 
during these times; I dont think 
anyone would be callous enough 
to evade the comment made by 
Hussein of Iraq this past week 
when he threatened to use chemi
cal weapons on Israel! For that 
matter, what would prevent 
Hussein from using weapons 
against any other ally? Nothing.
As far as the peace initiative 
that was being pressed by Presi
dent Bush and James Baker, Is
rael should not deal with Yassir 
Arafat and that same type of vio
lent and hypocritical equivocator. Arafat said that he wanted 
peace, so he went to the Vatican 
to talk to Pope John Paul II. And 
if one believes that, it is nothing 
short of a massive travesty of 
logical and rational thinking. If 
the Palestinians do get the West 
Bank and Gaza Strip, do you think 
it will end there?

Without men and women serving

nothing aboutit. But keep in mind, 
if it comes right down to it, these 
are the people who are going to 
puttheir lives on the line,as many 
have done before, so that our 
country could survive.
So remember they are human 
just like you and me. They do not 
wish to die, but if asked, they 
would lay down their life, so that 
people can retain their rights as 
set down in the United States 
Constitution.

Revenge will not 
resurrect the dead
HERBLOCK S CARTOON
W PEOPLE SAY I HAVE NO VISION'
Michael J. Ewedosh
Lets bury the dead.
Eight years ago, Kevin Tunell 
killed Susan Herzog in a drunk 
driving accident on New Years 
Day. He was 17 at the time, and 
was convicted of manslaughter.
Susans parents sued Kevin for 
$1.5 million, but settled for $936.
But there was a catch: Kevin 
was required to pay the Herzogs 
$1 every week until the year 2000. 
I told the kid face-to-face, Louis 
Herzog told the Associated Press, 
if you want to get on with your 
life and never see me again, just 
put a dollar in the mail every 
Friday.
The last thing that Kevin can 
do is get on with his life.
Im not disputing that Susans 
parents lost something that they 
can never get backa daughter. 
She was eighteen when she died. 
Her parents never had a chance 
to watch her go to college, estab
lish herself in a career, build a 
relationship, or start a family. 
Her parents were in the middle of 
the American dream and Kevin 
woke them up.
Kevin wasnt the only drunk 
idriver to squelch the dreams of 
ithe Herzogs. Another drunk 
driver maimed Susans sister.
That Susan is dead is Kevins 
fault. Her parents know that and 
refuse to let him forget.
Trying to put Susans death 
behind him, the man who volun
teered to spend six years of his life 
travelling to schools and civic 
groups to tell them about the 
horrors of drunken driving tried 
to go to the Herzogs with all of the
$1 payments. They refused to 
accept them; $1 every week was 
the agreement and thats exactly 
what they wanted.
The Herzogs seem to think that 
they have a right to punish Kevin 
for what he did to them and to 
their daughter, and they have 
used the judge in one ofVirginias 
civil courtrooms to do just that.
The Herzogs have no such right. 
Kevin was convicted of man
slaughter in a criminal trial. Since 
he was 17, the conviction was 
handed down by a juvenile court. 
He served his sentence and went 
farther to try to prevent others 
from inadvertently killing and 
maiming innocent people.
But the Herzogs wont let go. 
They cant bury their daughter. 
Their daughter was at the center 
of their American Dream; now 
Kevin has transformed that 
dream into an American night
mare.
Louis and Patricia Herzog need 
to wake up, again. Their daugh
ter died. They are keeping her 
alive in their minds along with all 
of their hopes and dreams for her 
and keeping the image of her 
death alive in Kevins mind.
Kevin, too, understands the 
American Dream and realizes 
that the Herzogs dream broke in 
his hands. He wakes each morn
ing knowing that their daughter 
will never wake again and that it 
is his fault.
How many more times do they 
want him to relive that New Years 
Day in 1982?
Theyve answered that question 
four times, by taking Kevin to 
court because he refuses to make 
the weekly payments. Theyve 
even managed to put him in jail 
for another 30 days.
The Herzogs message is that

you cant put a price on their 
daughters life. But they have 
effectively stamped a price on 
Kevins forehead.
In effect, they have bought 
Kevin for $1 a week. His life is 
theirs because he cant get on with 
his own. His dreams, his future, 
are all tied to their dead daugh
ter. And its Kevins dollar that 
the Herzogs are using to make 
sure it stays that way.
Susan Herzog died on New
Years Day in 1982. Its time for 
the Herzogs to bury their grief 
and their daughter and get on 
with life.
Maybe then Kevin can bury the 
image of the woman he killed and 
get on with life, before the image 
kills him.

sophomore who aspires to be an 
IM major. This is his first column 
for The Tartan.
Hi Robert,
Welcome to Carnegie Mellon. 
With this weekends snow, I guess 
youve now seen the biggest dif
ference between Santa Barbara 
and Pittsburgh. It must make you 
wonder why you received the of
fer before you came to campus.
Its a pity you didnt, arrive in 
August; then you could have gone 
through freshmen orientation 
with the other new arrivals. The 
adjustment to Carnegie Mellon 
can be daunting at times.
Your next three months here as 
Dicks shadow will be informa
tive for you. Youll get a feel for 
what this place is all about. It 
wont be as hard as you might 
think. For example, the accent 
wont give anything away 
whether youre from Pittsburgh 
or Paris, an accent is expected 
around these parts.
Youre coming in during an odd 
time. Most of us are getting ready 
for Spring Carnival. Those phal
lic-shaped objects youve seen on 
the Cut are called buggies. We get 
up early on weekend mornings 
when it doesnt snow or rain and 
push them around Schenley Park. 
Yes, there is someone inside each 
of them, but dont draw the wrong 
conclusions  this is not some 
form of hazing. We push buggies 
because we like to  at least 
thats what my push captain tells 
me.
That big pit behind Skibo will 
someday become an athletic field.
We do play sports here, just like 
at IJCSB. The only difference is 
that here no one attends the 
games. Therell be no more Dick 
Vitale at your gym on Big Mon
days when UCSB plays UNLV, 
but you will get 150 parents and 
girlfriends when Carnegie Mel
lon takes on Case Western.
Youll be hearing a few words a 
lot as you walk across the Cut. 
Pusher  this has nothing to do 
with crack, its more buggy talk. 
Quality of Life  last years big
gest buzzword; all we know is that 
we dont have it. Diversity  this 
years biggest buzzword; we have 
it, we think we like it, so long as it 
isnt forced on us. University 
Center  usually heard in this 
sentence: Someday, when we 
build the University Center. 
Money  students think the 
University has it, theyre wrong; 
CMU thinks students have it, boy, 
is the school wrong.
You can ignore some of the 
things printed about us in those 
college guidebooks. Despite what 
the Insiders Guide to the Colleges 
may say, we dont call anyone 
fruits or veggies. We dont all 
own computers. And we dont all 
wear black turtlenecks.
Itll be a big change for you. We 
dont have a beach or 20,000 stu
dents or colorful football mascots. 
We do have the Dirty O, 7000 
students, and the Scottie Dog. I 
hope theyll be enough.
Stewart Levine is a second-year 
masters candidate in GSIA. He 
will graduate before Mehrabian 
takes over and therefore needs to 
write columns about him now.
Youre never too old to follow your dreams
When I grow up, Im to be a 
cowboy, one of my friends told 
me yesterday right out of the blue.
I didnt say anything. What are 
you supposed say when youre in 
shock anyway?
Did you hear me Sue? I said 
Im going to be a cowboy.
Yeah, I heard-you, I assured 
my friend.
Well, what do you think?
\ I think, um, well uh ... gee, I 
really dont know what I think. 
Youre surprised, arent you? 
Well, I guess so, especially 
when you consider the fact that 
youre here to get a degree in civil 
engineering, not... Cowboy 101. 
Hey, its going to be cool. Ive 
got it all figured out. Im going to
Susan Abrams
get my degree, and then after I 
build a couple of bridges and dams, 
Im going to be rich enough to be 
able to retire early and do what I 
always wanted to do  live on a 
ranch and be with horses.
How do you know you will be 
rich enough? Suppose no one 
wants to hire you.
Not possible. You know Im 
doing well in my classes, and Ive 
already gotten some good job of
fers. Of course Im going to suc
ceed.
I only wish I were that confi
dent about my future.
Hmm, I began. Are you sure 
this is what you want to do? I 
mean, isnt it dangerous some
times?
Of course its dangerous. But 
this is something Ive wanted to 
do since I was a little kid. 
Nothings going to stop me from 
living up to my dreams.
Im not trying to stop you from 
anything. Im just worried. What 
if something wrong steps into the 
dream? What are you going to do 
then?
Then Ill fix it until its right. 
Youre sure about this?
You bet. This is the first time 
Ive been sure about anything in
my whole life.
Well, I wish you a lot of luck in 
pursuing your dreams.
What about you? Arent you 
going to go after your dreams? 
Oh, eventually. But I have a 
regular life to live first.
Dont wait too long. If you do, 
then youll only be giving up your 
dreams. And whats the point of 
living if you dont get. to do what 
youve always wanted to do? Think 
about it.
So I thought about it. Long and 
hard.
When I grow up, Im going to be 
a princess.

Miserable weather plagues spring sports
SPORTSPEAK
by Josh Ruben
Boycotts, baseball 
and the Bucs
A lot of people say that we, 
the fans, should boycott Open
ing Day. Doing so would send a 
message to both the players and 
the owners that the games true 
destiny is contingent on the 
support of the public. The 
players may demand higher 
salaries and the owners may 
gripe about arbitration, but 
ultimately, regardless of the is
sue at hand, the fans will suffer 
as will the game itself. This 
point is well taken and accepted 
; by everyone who follows or is in; volved with the game. So, if the 
I point is already made, the ques! tion becomes: what would the 
' point of such a boycott be?
; If you dont know by now, the 
; Activities Board has already 
; purchased hundreds of tickets 
; for the Pirates home opener 
! against the Chicago Cubs for 
. this Friday. Hundreds of 
> students have already pur
chased those tickets and are 
; planning to be at Three Rivers 
; Stadium to usher in the new 
J season. These' are people who 
I have suffered through the 
[ lockout. These are fans who 
! have also looked forward to 
' going to that Opening Day 
game, be they Pirate fans or 
not.
The fact is, millions of people 
have been looking forward to 
the start of the new season, but 
specifically the 1990 season.
With all the trials that the fans 
and the game itself went 
through last year with the Pete 
Rose scandal, the death of Bart 
Giamatti and the Earthquake 
Series, the 1990 season has 
been an expected light at the 
end of a seemingly endless 
tunnel ever since the final out of 
the World Series last year!
This is the season that is sup
posed to get everything back on 
track; put everything having to 
do with baseball back into focus 
and perspective. Fans want to 
enjoy the simple virtues of the 
game again, because of its 
significance to our culture.
An addiction nearly all Ameri
cans share is their addiction to 
baseball. Not all of the CMU 
students going to the game on 
'Friday are doing so because 
; they are dedicated fans of the 
; game. The game on Opening 
! Day, for anyone who has at! tended one, is a rite of passage.
 Its a party bigger than any
thing a fraternity or sorority
; can stage. Attending Opening 
; Day is not something one does 
because they enjoy the game,
! but because it is a uniquely 
J American tradition. The nature 
of the game dictates a childlike 
! quality since it is, unlike other 
sports, a childs game.
; People enjoy the sense of mys
tery associated with the begin
ning of baseball season; the 
[truly American value that 
anything is possible. It is 
! another quality baseball pos! sesses over all other sports.
 To boycott opening day, while
 being a strong political state
ment, would also be a refusal to 
; Partake in one of the few truly 
uplifting experiences life has to 
offer.
! Americans are junkies, and 
Jwe are loyal to baseball because 
1 it is our game. Our history and 
culture are woven into it and 
'When our leaders, lovers,
family, and friends all forsake 
us, we can always go to the 
ballpark.

Mother Nature certainly has 
not been too cooperative this 
spring, bringing all kinds of 
weather at all the wrong times.
Just ask Mens Track Coach 
Gary Meckley. The miserable 
weather has taken a toll on his 
team, which is halfway through 
its season with only two meets 
under its belt.
Meckley is convinced that his 
team blames him for the weather, 
and he jokingly suggests that a 
special committee be formed to 
decide the weather from now on, 
to remove the blame from his 
shoulders.
Unfortunately, though, theres 
nothing anybody can do except sit 
back and watch the sleet, snow, 
and rain fall, the blustery winds 
blow, listen to the crashing thun
derstorms, and feel the freezing 
temperatures.
Welcome to Pittsburgh.

He also pointed out that since 
Carnegie Mellon is not afforded 
the luxury of its own track, the 
team cannot practice on a track, 
and only gets track experience 
when it competes. We need the 
races to sharpen up, said
Donatelli.
Rain is not the only problem. 
Although the cold temperatures 
do not hurt the distance runners 
the sprinters muscles can't 
handle them.

Things had seemed to finally 
be going in the Carnegie Mellon 
Baseball Clubs favor. After a 
solid week of poor weather, the 
skies were clear for Sundays 
doubleheader against Penn 
State Universitys McKeesport 
Campus team. The team was 
excited for its season debut, as 
well as for the first game under 
new coach Neil Stoernell. Un
fortunately for Carnegie Mel
lon, Penn State dominated the 
CMU club, winning the doubleheader by scores of 4-0 and 
16-3.
We just didnt play well to
day, said Stoernell. Its been a 
while since weve been on the 
field, and it really showed.
The tone of the day was set 
early in the first game as two 
Carnegie Mellon errors ac
counted for a 2-0 Penn State 
lead after the first inning. The 
team would commit 13 errors

places some of the blame on the 
situation.
We hadnt been able to get

against us, he said. I could tell 
that they werent throwing well 
in the pre-game warm-ups.

Despite losses, individual play 
should boost mens tennis
By ALIM RAY
Tartan Senior Staffwriter
Even though the Carnegie 
Mellon mens tennis team has not 
had the best record in the past 
two weeks, individual play has 
outshined the match scores.
During spring break, the team 
had four away matches, three of 
which were against Division III 
teams. The Tartans beat 
Macalester, 9-0 and Morgan State 
(Division I), but lost to Colby, 5-4, 
and the College of St. Thomas, 
ranked 14th in the country, 81.
Last weeks Tuesday and Wed
nesday matches were rained out, 
but the Tartans did compete Fri
day and Saturday in Ohio against 
Denison and Kenyon, both ranked 
in the top 20 in the country in 
Division III. Carnegie Mellon lost 
to Denison 9-0 and to Kenyon 
7-2.
The good news from the last 
two weeks is that freshman An
drew Lee and junior Haja Rabe,
The team is doing better and better 
each week ... hopefully theyll peak at 
the UAA championships. 
 Coach Richard Scheines
Carnegie Mellons number one 
doubles team, have taken a deci
sive step toward making Nation
als; Lee also has a good chance to 
make Nationals in singles.
Individual players make Na
tionals by beating players on 
ranked teams in their division. 
Number three singles Matt Davis 
also threatened players on ranked 
teams these past two weeks.
Lee and Rabe won their match 
in three sets against St. Thomas, 
giving the Tartans their only 
point. They split the first two sets 
with the team from Denison, but 
lost the match in a tiebreak at the 
end. A tiebreak was played in
place of the third set since the 
match would not have been fin}- 
ished before darkness otherwise;.
Saturday against Kenyon, Le6 
won his singles match, as well as 
his doubles match with Rabe. !
Coach Richard Scheines be* 
lieves Lee and Rabe can do well in 
the UAA tournament at the end 
of the season, an important steft 
toward Nationals.
Davis, last years number six 
singles player and MVP of the 
season, had a tough match SaturJday against St. Thomas. Davis 
won the first set of the match and. 
was ahead in the second set be^- 
continued on page l4
still win the PAC. But we need the 
competition.
 Coach Gary Meckley
Although Meckley tries to main
tain a sense of humor about the 
teams predicament, there is still 
a lot to be serious about.
For example, the track team 
heads to Atlanta in less than two 
weeks for the UAA champion
ships. With only two meetsworth 
of experience, Meckley is doubt
ful that the team is as prepared as 
it could be.
Because of that, he is trying to 
schedule some extra meets this 
week.
Our season could be ruined, 
said Meckley. We can still win 
the PAC. But we need the compe
tition.
Meckley is hoping th at the team 
will peak very quickly at the 
right time, which would be next 
weekend in Atlanta at Emory.
The womens team is in the same 
boat, according to Coach Dario 
Donatelli. It hurts the whole 
team, he said, but especially the 
sprinters and specialty people 
[long jumpers, hurdlers]. They 
really benefit from competition, 
said Donatelli, which is something 
there has been very little of this 
season.
The women have only competed 
once so far, and that was March 
17. Such sparse competition, 
Donatelli said, is detrimental to

St. Vincent wins 
in lacrosses only 
game of week
By STEPHEN KANG
Tartan Staffwriter
! As the unexpected bad weather 
continued, the CMU lacrosse team 
had to cancel two games in the 
first week of April.
; Its first game of April, which 
\yas scheduled to be played in the 
Pitt Stadium lastWednesday, had 
tb be moved to another date (yet 
to be decided) due to sudden rain 
and freezing temperature.
This was a disappointment for 
i many CMU team players since 
most of them had a long-standing 
feud with the neighboring Pitt la
crosse team.
; Unlike football, a lacrosse game 
usually cannot be played in cold 
3 weather because the sticks that 
are used under the official rules 
are made of plastic, and they break 
easily when hit by another stick 
or a ball.
Therefore, the Pitt game, even 
though anticipated by many to be 
the most emotional game of the 
season, had to be cancelled.
To make the matter worse, 
Saturdays game against Slippery 
Rock was also cancelled when the 
snow came down covering the 
whole field during the night.
Slippery Rock was CMUsmost 
physical opponent in the presea
son. It was expected to be a physi
cal game as well on Saturday. 
However, because the snow cov
ered all the lines on the field, the 
g^me became impossible to play. 
Tlhus, CMU had to be content 
with just practice drills and 
games.
... practice is 
even more impor
tant now that the 
team is not get
ting the playing 
time needed.
The unusually cold weather and 
snow has not helped the team 
since the last game was played a 
week before spring break. De
spite the practices in the after
noon, the players are obviously 
rusty as they have not been in 
real game situations for nearly 
three weeks now.
According to team veteran, 
junior Rob Kendall, the practice 
is even more important now that 
the team is not getting the play
ing time needed. Its mandatory 
that [every] player shows up and 
throws, catches, and runs the 
plays. Practice is very important 
as the games are coming up. We 
have the talent to beat any team 
in our league and its necessary 
that all the players show up.
Even though this week has not 
been great for the team, because 
both games against Pitt and Slip
pery Rock had to be put on the 
delay list, CMU still played a com
petitive game against St.Vincent 
Sunday afternoon at Fox Chapel. 
With the weather warming on 
Sunday, St.Vincent came to play 
as scheduled.
Bad weather leaves 
sports, buggy in limbo

The whole game was a see-saw 
battle until the final quarter. With 
the score tied at 9-9, St.Vincent 
fired in four goals. With
St.Vincent up 13-9, CMU tried to 
score many times but could not 
and the game was lost.
The game began with
St.Vincent scoring two goals first. 
Then, CMU scored the next four 
goals. Not backing down, 
St.Vincent tied the score at four. 
In the second quarter,

postponed because of poor 
weather. And when it cant prac

cording to Coach Neil Stoernell. 
In Sundays game, the team com
mitted 13 errors.
In addition, lacrosse, rugby, and 
mens tennis have had games 
cancelled or postponed.
Besides the varsity and club 
sports plagues, buggy has also 
felt the wrath of a ruthless Mother 
Nature.
Free rolls this spring have been 
pretty sparse  since the first 
day of rolls on the first weekend of 
March, they have been held only 
three times.
With Carnival and race day just 
around the corner, some organi
zations are getting a little wor
ried.
Race day is goingto be a mess, 
predicts Phi Kappa Thetas Buggy 
Chair EdBockman, a senior. The 
first time that a lot of organiza
tions go all out will be race day.
Sweepstakes Chair Erica Levy, 
also a senior, agrees with Bockman. According to Levy, several 
organizations, including Sigma 
Nu, Pi Kappa Alpha, Beta Theta 
Pi, Spirit, Delta Upsilon, and Phi 
Kap, are rolling new buggies.
The rules dictate that each 
buggy must roll at least five times 
to be eligible for Sweepstakes. 
Some organizations were con
cerned about fulfilling the require
ment, since so many free rolls 
were being cancelled.
This Saturday, it looked as 
though they were on, until a spring 
snowstorm swept across campus.
However, Sundays cold but 
clear conditions were ideal, and 
several organizations finally got

Also, organizations are work
ing together and rolling their 
buggies simultaneously to save 
time.
Levy stressed that organiza
tions that came out the weekend 
before spring break benefitted 
greatly and showed a lot of com
mittment by getting in a lot of 
rolls.
Levy also mentioned the safety 
factor, since the new buggies will 
not have had much experience, 
and some drivers may not be 
completely acquainted with the 
buggies.
But all of this may be needless 
worrying, since the weather on 
Carnival weekend may take a 
nasty turn and prevent full races. 
Rain or shine, the races must go 
on somehow.
There has never been a time 
when we did not roll at all [on 
Sweepstakes], said Levy. If the 
weather is bad on Friday or Sat
urday, races can be held on Sun
day, she said.

Baseball club starts 
season on sour note
continued from page 11
Ion; only once in the game did a 
CMU base runner make it as far 
as second base, and Carnegie 
Mellon only got four hits. How
ever, Stoemell was pleased with 
some of what he saw, and once 
again put some blame on the 
weather.
The second game saw a brief 
awakening of the CMU offense, 
and CMU led PSU 3-2 entering 
the last half of the third inning. 
However, PSU exploded for nine 
runs in the third and added five 
more in the fourth to come away 
with the 16-3 win when darkness 
forced the stoppage of the game.
We played afairly decent first 
game, commented Stoemell, but 
we had a lot of trouble catching
and throwing the ball in the sec
ond game. 
Despite the losses, Stoernell 
remains optimistic about his 
teams chances. I dont want the 
players to be too disappointed. 
We did some things pretty well. I 
thought the catching and pitchd 
ing were good, and we did a good, 
job on things like cutoffs and sign 
nals. I think weve got a lot o 
room to improve, and we should 
only get better.
This week, the Tartans play host 
to a rematch game against PSU 
Thursday before travelling t 
Waynesburg on Saturday. 
Thursdays game, scheduled to; 
start at 2:30 pm, will be held at 
Mellon Field on Fifth and Penn 
Avenues.
Scheines counts on 
individual excellence
continued from page 11
fore injuring his knee.
The injury did not cause Davis 
to forfeit the match, but it did 
lower his level of play and eventu
ally cost him the match.
Scheines is pleased with the 
past two weeks. I think every
body else played well, he said. 
He also mentioned freshman Jeff 
Blankenship and junior Mike 
Ferrence as examples.
Sch eines also believes that The 
team is doing better and better
each week ... hopefully they will  
peak at the UAAchampionships.- 
Tomorrow, the team goes to' 
Washington and Jefferson CoU 
lege at 4 pm. Thursday, the teaml. 
is home against WestminsterCollege at 3 pm. Next Tuesday;^ 
the Tartans round out the regu-* 
lar season at home with Grove" 
City at 3 pm. Conference play 
begins with the UAA champion 
ships, which will be next week 
end, followed by the PAC champi 
onships the next weekend.

April showers prevent 
two lacrosse games

their favor, 7-5, by the halftime.
In the second half, the game 
was often played on the ground, 
causing many penalties and 
physical banging by both teams. 
As the game seemed to go down to 
the wire at a 9-9 tie, St.Vincent 
pulled away unexpectedly. Scor
ing for CMU were junior Rob 
Kendall with three goals, Scott 
Johnson with two, junior Phil 
Kaplan with two, and Miguel 
Triay and Phil Kessler each with 
a goal.
Many CMU players felt that 
the loss was due to a lack of physi
cal conditioning and the execu
tion of the plays.
As the defenseman, Steve 
McAlonan remarked, We didnt 
lose because of our stick skills or 
ability; we lost because we werent 
quite running to the right places 
quick enough near the end of 
game.
Even though the loss was a 
tough one to take, CMU players 
still agreed that they have the 
good portion of season left with 
probably two toughest teams al
ready played, Pittsburgh Lacrosse 
Club (PLC) and St.Vincent. Team

Volume 84, Issue 21The Tartan, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania10 April 1990
Carnegie Mellon grad returns to Pittsburgh to speak and film
By STEPHEN GLICKER
L Tartan Diversions Editor
The thing that I always wanted to 
know when I was going here was, Is 
what Im learning here any good?  rec
ollected Drama Alumnus Andy Wolk 
during a lecture last Monday while visit?ing his training ground, Carnegie Mel
lon. Is it going to help me in any way 
when I get out into the real world? 
Wolk graduated from the Department 
of Drama with a master of fine arts 
degree in directing in 1973. Since then 
his career has spanned theatre, televi
sion, and film, including winning the 
Writers Award for best television movie 
(Natica Jackson) and, iust last week.
i nomas Nicnois/ lartan Hnoto bailor 
VIsA -lFC rmlC4 lI s2,4o82I0 se,2I0 D2r r8wA 2I M288rEe,0D Nl, D2r I4T N2Fu. tm808eNS 
a2,o8Dui
finishing directing the HBO movie Crimi
nal Justice.
When I first got here I really thought, 
Why did I make this horrible decision?  
recalled Wolk. Back then Pittsburgh 
was a lot worse. You would open the door 
and your senses would be assaulted by 
iron filings and a horrible smell. 
However, even after a rocky start, Wolk 
learned a lot at CMU which helped him 
later on during his career. What I think 
is really valuable about a place like 
Carnegie is that you get a chance to 
direct. Directing, in a certain way, is like 
making love. The only way you can learn 
about doing it, is by doing it.
He went on to explain how CMU is a 
great place to discover yourself, and get 
your feet wet in the directing field. What 
was great for me about being in Carnegie 
is the fact that its like a conservatory 
and you had an opportunity to just work 
and do what you wanted to do, and do 
your work and direct plays, and find out 
what you wanted to do. The opportunity 
to do that doesnt exist in the real world 
anymore.
Wolk also told the audience, which 
consisted mostly of drama students, 
about how his stay here wasnt all work, 
but play too. All I did while I was here 
was rehearse and play basketball.
We put together a Drama Depart
ment basketball team. [Other people] 
couldnt believe that the Drama Depart
ment had this good team. But soon Wolk
"Directing, in a certain way, is like making 
love. The only way you can learn about doing 
it, is by doing it.
 Andy Wolk
went onto more serious subjects, such as 
a life outside of CMU, the real world. 
When I first graduated here I told 
myself that I would never take a non
theatre job, Wolk said. I got a job teach
ing acting in Brooklyn. I would teach 
acting at Brooklyn College five days a 
week from 8 to 9:30.... I would then to the 
Manhattan Theatre Club by 10:30 and 
Id work all day for 75 dollars a week. Id 
J;hen finish directing at the Manhattan 
Theater Club aiid would then go back to 
Brooklyn College and direct a play with 
students just so that I could be directing 
something at the same time. I would 
finish that around midnight, and I was 
living on someones cot. Thats what you 
have to do in New York, and if you could 
go to New York tomorrow and get that 
job, I would be shocked. I dont think that 
you could get that, thats a good job. 
He also recalled about how he got his 
first real job as a director. During the 
first year that I was in the Manhattan 
Theatre club someone came to me with a 
play.... They said to me, Do you want to 
direct this play? I was so excited that I
went home, called him up, and said yes. 
I didnt even read the play. I would have 
directed the telephone book.
However, he soon turned the clock 
forward to 1990 and to talk about just 
how difficult the directing field is today. 
Back then, all you had to do to have a 
play was an idea, and get a couple of 
actors together. You cant do that any
more. Its just not possible, he told the 
audience.
As the afternoon was winding down, 
and his lecture was coming to an end, 
Wolk talked a little about his writing 
career and gave some advice for young 
directors. Being a director is a hard job. 
No one is going to knock on your door and 
give it to you. It really takes a lot of 
persistence, perseverance, and unwill
ingness to take no for an answer be
cause everyone is going to tell you no.
To get ahead in this business you 
have to find some little way to wedge 
yourself in the door, and not give up, he 
said. If you use every resource avail
able, youll get ahead in this business. 
There really isnt any other way.

wins the Watson Fellowship
By ERIC J. MCANALLEN
Tartan Asst. Features Editor
I was very excited because its 
such an honor. Im very privileged. 
There are not too many people in 
this world who can just take a year 
and have a free vacation, just to go 
do anything they want and explore 
some facet of their life in which 
theyre interested, said senior 
Robert Cucuzza.
Cucuzza recently won a fellow
ship of $13,000 from the Thomas J. 
Watson Foundation to study experi
mental theatre abroad for a year. He 
plans to visit England, France, Ger
many and Poland and attending the
atre festivals throughout Europe. 
Its going to be the world tour, he 
joked.
Cucuzza plans to keep his itiner
ary fairly unstructured, Its 
basically exploring. he said. Theres 
no studying, no papers. Im probably 
just going over and exploring the 
nonconventional theatre world.
Although Cucuzza is a literary and 
cultural studies major, his project 
deals with studying and experienc
ing Europes experimental theatre. 
I came to Carnegie Mellon as an 
acting major in the Drama Depart
ment. After the first semester of my 
sophomore year, I decided that I 
wanted to pursue English for a while, 
just to get a broader view of the
world.
However, Cucuzza couldnt stay 
away from the theatre for long. Af
ter another semester, he returned to 
the stage, only this time with a new 
perspective.
I was able to come through the 
back door and approach it differ
ently because Id had literary theory 
classes, film theory classes, and his
tory classes which gave me a much 
more complete sense of the world, 
and therefore a more complete sense 
of drama.
When Cucuzza found out about 
his selection as a Watson fellow he 
was incredibly overwhelmed. Ive 
never traveled before, he said. Ive 
been as far as Milwaukee. To think 
that Im going to be in Poland next 
year at some point is just unfathom
able to me.
However, Cucuzza isnt walking 
with his head completely in the 
clouds. He realizes that there are 
going to be some difficulties in visit
ing a foreign place and breaking the 
language barrier, but he sees even 
those as part of the experience and 
adventure.
Im also very scared, he said. 
The only languages I speak are Eng
lish and foul language. Im going to 
be very disoriented. Its going to be 
scary, but its also going to be excit
ing. I just want to be thrown off 
kilter for a while.
The Watson Fellowship program 
is administered through fifty-five 
small, private colleges and universi
ties which nominate seniors for the 
award. This was the first year that 
Carnegie Mellon was eligible to 
nominate students.
The nomination procedure consists 
of submitting a proposal, an autobi
ography, a photograph, a transcript, 
and two recommendations to the 
university which then selects its 
nominees. Carnegie Mellon chose 
four students from the twenty-one 
applicants.
Along with Cucuzza, the other 
nominees were senior chemistry and 
philosophy major Geneva Clark, 
senior professional and creative 
writing major David Koehn, and 
senior mathematics and German 
major Anthony Stallone.
The Watson foundation reads the 
proposals, conducts interviews, and 
finally selects the winners of the fel
lowships. Cucuzza was one of 76 
winners from a field of 198 nomi
nees, and also the first Carnegie 
Mellon student to receive a Watson 
fellowship.
Looking forward to his trip, Cu
cuzza said, Im very excited because 
its going to be an amazing year. Im 
going to see so many things Ive 
never seen before, and Im going to 
learn so much about myself and 
about the theatre.

Professor Kaiser speaks on German reunification
By DEXTER T. KOBAYASHI
Tartan Asst. Features Editor
The wall that had separated 
East and West Germany for over 
three decades has gone down. But 
as the Iron Curtain crumbles in 
Berlin, new problems arise and 
old fears are resurfacing. Will 
Germany be a whole nation once 
again? And if so, what will hap
pen? Dr. David Kaiser, associate 
professor of history, addressed 
these issues Wednesday in a lec
ture on the ramifications of the 
reunification of Germany.
The lecture took place in the 
Wherrett Room and people were 
sitting in the aisles due to a lack 
of room.
A reunified Germany has been 
a topic of great interest lately. 
Some people are hopeful of a
united Germany with more eco
nomic and political freedom. 
Others fear the return of the im
perialistic Germany that led to 
both world wars. These fears have 
been met with everything rang
ing from discussion to humor.
Kaiser said that he did not share 
these fears but said, The ques
tion is, Does Germany still want 
to colonize and imperialize as it 
did in 1914? The answer is a 
resounding No!  He added that 
he had no huge fears of the fu
ture.
Germanys goals are different 
now, said Kaiser. One of the big
gest concerns of the contempo
rary Germanys is exports. Kaiser 
said he didnt see any reason for a 
unified Germany to try to acquire 
any more territory.
Nationalism was at the top of
"The question is, 'Does Germany still 
want to colonize and imperialize as it 
did in 1914? The answer is a re
sounding No! "
 Professor David Kaiser
Kaisers list of causes for 
Germanys pre-1914 imperialism. 
In the 19th century, said Kai
ser, the prevailing issue was to 
produce homogeneous independ
ent state nations of people of one 
culture. The French were in the 
southern part of Europe, the 
Danes were in the north, the Poles 
were in the East, and the Ger
mans were concentrated in the 
center.
Kaiser then discussed 
Germanys desire to influence the 
rest of Europe more before the 
start of the first World War. Ger
many had hoped to annex land in 
Poland and then proceed to move 
the people out of the newly an
nexed land and recolonize it with 
Germans. However, the Germans 
were not the only ones planning 
to move whole populations of 
ethnic groups. The Allied powers 
made plans to move the Germans 
out of Poland at the end of World 
War II.
The Allies won and carried out 
their policies, said Kaiser. The 
allies rationalized their actions 
by saying, Hitler was planning 
to do it, so why couldnt they?
The ide? of recolonizing an
nexed lands is not new. According 
to Kaiser, the Greeks and the 
Turks had already done it centu
ries before. But it always leads to 
tight relations between recoloniz
ers of a land and its original in
habitants.
During the 50s, some Germans 
still considered East Germany to 
be Central Germany and Poland 
to be the real Eastern Germany. 
Some East Germans have visited 
their old homes in Poland and 
purportedly made comments to 
the effect, Please keep it in shape, 
we plan to be back in a few years. 
Kaiser said that this will proba
bly cause problems for quite a few 
years and that there is some 
thought of buying back the land.
Kaiser mentioned that an issue 
more important than the past na
tionalism of Germany is the mili
tary security of Europe. With the 
tearing down of the wall, East 
and West Germany no longer have 
a clear frontier between them. 
They are no longer on opposite 
sides and it isnt just the Allies 
versus the Axis, anymore. The 
tearing down of the wall repre
sents a disintegration of the sepa
ration of two opposing sides.
East and West Germany are 
now closer to being one nation 
than they are to being nations of 
conflicting forces. In Europe, the 
move is away from nationalism 
and towards greater European 
integration.
Kaiser closed his lecture with a 
quote by J. W. Goethe, poet, nov
elist, and dramatist of the 1800s.

In a letter to a friend, Goethe 
wrote, The German nation is 
nothing, but the individual Ger
man is something, and yet they 
imagine the opposite to be true.
The Germans should be dispersed., 
throughout the world, like the 
Jews, in order fully to develop all 
the good that is in them for the 
benefit of mankind.

It was amusing. I liked the To tell the truth, I didnt see 
interview with Cyert. That was it. 
probably the only thing I read en
tirely.
A persons opinion
Last Tuesday, The Natrat hit 
the stands that are usually hit 
by The Tartan. Every year, since 
who knows when, there has been 
a Natrat. It usually comes out 
the first Tuesday after Spring 
Break.
The Natrat is an annual issue 
that contains jokes about almost 
everything. It is meant to be 
taken in a lighthearted sort of 
manner. Its also meant to be 
funny and humorous to the 
people who read it.
Is it really as funny as the 
people who wrote it think it is? 
Or are the writers some of the 
non-funniest people on campus 
since Dick Cyert?
So, we went out and asked the 
campus community, who had a 
chance to read The Natrat what 
they thought about it.
To tell the truth, I havent had 
a chance to read it, but Ive only 
heard bad comments about it, no 
good comments.
I glanced through it, 
really didnt read it. However, I 
thought the funniest thing was 
the CSW Movie Collection. 
Whoever wrote that was really 
funny.

Destructive cults utilize mind control techniques
By KEVIN BARNEY
Tartan Features Editor
!'Editors Note: This is the second 
i of. two articles based on the lecture 
! given by Fritz Knabe on March 
112.
j. I got some good things out of 
1 Lifespring. I mean anybody who 
; \$ent through an experience like 
;that had to become stronger. I 
! learned things about my self which 
r 'never knew before, but I paid a
 heavy price for it. After being in
> and gettingout and going through 
aiot of hell, I think Im a better 
; person for it than when I started. 
Khabe declared during his lecture on the destructive cult,
! Lifespring.
: He went on to explain how 
people could prevent themselves 
from being lured into a destruc
tive cult.
; ^According to Knabe the method 
$ed by most destructive cults in 
ISBtaining new members consists
bf.mind control techniques. The 
lour major methods of mind con
trol were all implemented in the 
recruiting of members for 
iiifespring.
! ;The four methods of mind conttbl are: controlling the environfii'ent, dominating the persons 
motions, blocking out the infor
mation he/she receives, and also 
manipulating the eating and
sleeping schedule of the victim. 
The controlling of the environ
ment starts with the first day of 
training. In the training session, 
the Lifespring staffmembers ma
nipulated the temperature and 
lighting of the ballroom in the 
hotel where the training session 
was held. When asked if he no
ticed the lighting and tempera
ture changes, Knabe replied, I 
didnt notice the temperature 
changes, but once I noticed that 
the lights were real dim. A lot of 
these things go on and youre not 
really aware of them.
The domination of emotions is 
one of the more powerful tech
niques employed. A popular exer
cise that was often used in 
Lifespring is the closed eye exer
cise. As Knabe explained this is 
where you close your eyes and 
visualize something. As soon as 
you close your eyes, your brain 
goes into what is called the alpha 
stage. You are more susceptible 
to what people say and during the 
Lifespring training, you spend 
more than half the time with your 
eyes closed.
Role-playing is also a big emo
tional controller. Another exer
cise in the basic training was roleplaying. People went off in pairs. 
One would play the others par
ent and extract feelings of fear 
and guilt. Then the two would 
switch roles. Knabe remarked
that this role-playing was very 
strong. People would break down 
and just start crying.
A lesser technique utilized was 
the blocking out of information to 
the victims. News from the out
side world was not let into the 
training area.
Some information, such as the 
background of Lifespring and its 
leaders, was also withheld. Other 
facts about Lifespring were coveredup for obvious reasons. These 
included the number of deaths 
and lawsuits resulting from 
Lifespring training.
The last and one of the more 
powerful procedures of mind 
control is the domination of the 
eating and sleeping schedules of 
the victims. The people that en
tered basic training were told 
when, what, and how much to 
eat. In addition, training started 
at seven in the morning or so and 
continued until 11:30 or midnight. 
This non-stop training left the 
victims no time to think about 
what was going on. Once they 
were released from the training 
program they went to bed and 
fell asleep almost immediately, 
said Knabe.
This also weakened the train
ees to the point that they could 
really offer no resistance to the 
programs.
Another activity that prevents 
cult members from thinking is
chanting. Knabe cited an example 
of this chanting. The Hare Krishnas chant over 1,000 times each 
morning. This keeps the cult 
members from thinking about 
what they are actually doing.
A member of the audience was 
quick to point out that cults arent 
the only ones using mind control 
for their own purposes. Many 
advertisers use mind control to 
help sell their products. Even 
Alcoholics Anonymous uses mind 
control to help their patients get 
over their addictions. Knabe 
pointed out that AA does-use mind 
control, but overall the organiza
tion is doing a beneficial thing for 
their members.
At the end of the lecture, Knabe 
also gave tips on how to avoid 
getting lured in by a destructive 
cult. If someone does invite you to 
a weekend event or if you think 
that someone is trying to get you 
involved in a cult, there are sev
eral things that you should ask 
the person.
First, ask them if they are trying 
to recruit you for something and if 
so, what is the history of the leader 
and the organization. If that per
son doesnt know the background 
of the organization and its leader,
then it could be a destructive cult.
In addition, dont give out your 
phone number or address; take 
down their name and number.
As a final piece of advice, Knabe: 
wisely suggested, Get a second; 
opinion. Dont walk blindly iiifiE 
something. Ask someone who yoii. 
trust.

j So Bam Bam and I had two 
days to get from Ireland to Ja
maica, in order to make it in time 
fjjr.the bobsled event in this years 
Olympic Games. The train was 
most comfortable as it glided
5 acrioss the Atlantic Ocean.
! Editor: Trains cant glide across 
water.
| Ok, so the train started sinking 
f^st. Bam Bam swam, out the 
vfindow and started heading for 
tjiei surface. Unfortunately he 
vjent in the wrong direction and 
hje ended up on the ocean floor. He 
drowned. Then he died. Now hes 
ciamfood, for a lot of clams, 
i So, I swam in the correct direc- states with the editors body. We 
. tijon, breaking the surface of the buried him in New Jersey, a fate 
' w(ater when I was almost out of I wouldnt wish on almost anybj-eath. My good friend Toto came one. Then we went back out on 
by with his monster mountain the road, down towards our lovely 
tijuck. Good thing, too. The tires Carribean state, Jamaica, 
were so big that it actually floated. On the way through Georgia,
kToto picked me up and then we we stopped at the state prison to 
'patched the surface of the water visit Totos family. His mother 
that I had broken. was in prison for discharging a
fiditor: Monster Mountain loaded weapon in a crowded mens
room. His father, on the other 
hand, was in prison for 59 counts 
of attempted murder and one 
count of murder. I cant believe 
that it took him that long to kill 
his banker.
While Toto was reminiscing 
about the good old days of blood 
and gore with his parents, I 
wandered around the maximum 
security facility looking for old
trucks dont ride across the water.
Yes, they do. I said that the 
tires were big enough to make the 
whole thing float.
Editor: And what the hell is a 
monster mountain truck?
Its a truck, the kind that just 
ran over you.
So, Toto and I rode back to the
Thats when I saw him. It was 
the Easter Bunny. Why was the 
Easter Bunny in prison? Who 
cared? All that mattered was that 
I had to get him out.
I walked up to a guard. Can I 
borrow your keys for a second? I 
lost my car keys and I was won
dering if one of the jailcell keys 
would fit.
Uh, sure. I laughed to myself 
as I took the keys. Pitt graduates 
are so much fun to play with. I ran 
back to the Bunny and let him 
out. We ran out of his cellblock 
and found Toto.
Hey Toto, were doing a jailbreak type of thing. Want to give 
us a lift?
Sure. Jump in back, dude and 
Bunny. Dude and Bunny? That 
soundedlike a bad NBC TV show.
We got back in Totos truck and 
discretely drove through the 
prison wall.
The big furry, four legged crea
ture jumped in and I took the 
opportunity to ask a question that 
had long bothered me. Are you a 
bunny or a rabbit?
What do you think? Easter 
Bunny.
Oh, I never thought of it that 
way.
So there we were, motoring 
through Florida on our way to 
replace the Jamaican bobsled 
team, carryingthe fugitive Easter 
Bunny. It just doesnt get any 
better than this.
Or does it? The Easter Bunny 
opened up his basket and pulled 
out, thats right, a brewski or two 
as the case was. Small case  I 
usually get the 24 beer case.
It was a Malta Amstel. Tasted 
kind of funny. I usually dont like 
stout beers and this was definitely 
a stout beer. Astout beer that was 
brewed in Amsterdam.
I took a sip and had to choke 
back tears caused by the sweet
ness of the beer.
What kind of flavoring is this? 
I asked the Bunny.
To me it tastes sort of like a
stout beer with a lot of root beer 
syrup in it.
He was right.
So Toto was plowing through 
the Everglades as we finished the 
last of the Easter Bunnys brews.
Shit, Im losing traction. These 
alligators keep getting stuck in 
my treads. Toto announced.
Just turn up the music and 
well be fine, said the Easter 
Bunny.
After driving over another body 
of water, we arrived at Jamaica. 
It was beautiful. You could just 
taste the bobsleds.
We docked the truck and hopped 
off onto a creaky old pier. The 
Easter Bunny was looking kind of 
strange. He had a strange grim
ace on his face. Oops, he laid an
eggWe went to the center of town 
and found the Chamber of Com
merce. Can you direct us to the 
Jamaican Bobsled training 
grounds? I asked.
They broke up laughing. 
Bobsled team, are you nuts? We 
kicked them out of the country 
months ago. They were a dis
grace.
Being disgruntled, we left, got 
Totos truck, and drove over the
building.
Well, now what? I asked the 
rabbit. I mean bunny.
Well, he said, Why dont you 
try to find the White Burger?
Oh yeah, the White Burger. I 
had sort of forgotten about it. Wait  
... what would the Easter Bunny 
know about the White Burger?
Wait... what would you know 
about the White Burger? I asked.
Well, maybe if you help me 
deliver all these eggs this year, I 
could help you out on your quest.
I could use a little vacation. Jail 
sucks.
What were you in jail for? 
Prank phone calls.
Man, thats pretty intense. 
Yeah, but thats all in the past. 
Ive got to get back in the Easter 
groove. So lets go deliver some

The new president storms into CMU students lives
Sometimes you have to do things 
you do not want to do. On Wednes
day I had to pull an all-nighter in 
order to finish assignments which 
were due on the following day. I 
dont want your pity so shut up. 
In any case it is about eight o 
clock and I am sitting in the base
ment of Skibo, waiting for the 
shuttle to arrive. My mouth is 
wide open, there is the odd stream 
of drool coming out of it; yes, I 
know its not a pleasing image, 
but reality is seldom pleasing.
I am sitting-there, drifting in 
and out of a dream which can best 
be described as a cross between 
Barbarella and Umberto Eco, and 
all of the sudden, just as the scan.tily clad star maidens are about 
to decode systems of meaning in a 
popular text, I am nudged in the 
shoulder. My eyelids fly open, and 
I find myself staring in the face of 
a semi-chubby man wielding a 
microphone. He looks at me ten
tatively; I look at him narcoleptically. I try to convey a desire not 
tolbe spoken to, but apparently 
thas is interpreted as the sprightly 
look of a person with a lot to say. 
I 4oiow this because the man 
irflmediately informs me that: 
?Hi there, Im from WTAE, Im 
taking student reaction.
3 look at the man in some confu
sion. Mustering as much energy 
al could I answer in a cogent and 
coherent huh? I scramble to 
collect my thoughts. Here is the 
opportunity most people would 
die for  someone wants to know 
my opinion! Somewhere, some
how, somebody decided that I 
should be heard, that my reaction 
is important enough to stand as a 
representative of the student body 
of Carnegie Mellon. My voice, ring
ing loud and clear on the radio 
waves, oozing with sage opinions 
and scorching witticisms. In less 
time than it takes to say Andy
George Bush die while I was writ
ing my history paper? Was there 
a revolution? Why was he replaced 
by Lech Walesa?

mittee named the new school 
president today.'

"In vniioc Mnr thin that came int0 my mind ruu lit /vu i was .<Doherty quit? 0h my god!,
by Javier Grillo-Msrxusch Needless to say, I was not on the 
ball this morning.) To be perfectly 
honest, I really thought that this 
had been settled while I took my 
semester abroad and that the new 
president was just a relatively 
shy guy who had not appeared in 
public yet.
Here, let me read you this. He 
says as he removes the photocopy 
from my face (I wish someone had 
explained the adhesive qualities 
of my own drool before this morn
ing). Two things seem weird now. 
One, why is this guy reading this 
to me? Two, why
Rooney, Umberto Eco and the 
scantily clad Star Maidens disap
pear and are replaced by thoughts 
of Academy Award ceremonies 
and Pulitzer Prizes on the mantle, 
(For some reason, whenever some
thing good happens in my life I 
think of the Academy Award cere
mony. Sometimes I wonder what 
fictional acceptance speech I am 
going to be giving on the moment 
my first child is born, a fantasy 
which is often breached by the 
thought of my 
wife storming 
the stage and 
accusing me of 
plagiarism.)
Then it hits 
me.
I have no idea 
as to what it is 
that this man 
wants me to 
react to. Imme
diately I set this 
situation 
straight with 
another huh?
As I casually 
wipe a brand 
new stream of 
drool from my
chin, the man springs the big 
whammy on me.
About the new President. As 
he says this he holds a photocopy 
of a newspaper story. I look at the 
fuzzy reproduction of the picture
My mouth is 
wide open, there 
is the odd 
stream of drool 
coming out of it, 
yes, I know its 
not a pleasing 
image, but real
ity is seldom 
pleasing.
is he insisting on 
getting a reac
tion from a zom
bie who has not 
only effectively 
demonstrated 
his inability to 
communicate 
verbally, but who 
has also shown 
complete igno
rance of the topic 
at hand and who 
looks as if he 
needs to have 
things read to 
him. Obviously I 
am the perfect in
terview subject, 
too tired to fight and just ignorant 
enough to say something unin
formed and controversial.
So I say something and he says 
here, let me get the microphone 
on. So a few seconds later I am 
on the page. Wait a minute, did repeating myself to this man. If
the microphone had been 
equipped with fiber optic wire he 
may also have gotten a really nifty 
tonsil-scan out of the whole thing. 
I cant remember what I said, I 
think it was something along the 
lines of my hoping that every 
department receive funding ac
cording to its needs. I was trying 
to be as fair and egalitarian as 
possible. Obviously the inter
viewer didnt see it that way, 
because he lunged forward and 
said:
Do you mean that you think 
that some of the departments of 
this school have been neglected?
Before I could think I blurt out 
definitely! All of the sudden I 
have made a completely unin
formed value judgement on the 
entire school without having any 
idea as to what I am speaking 
about. I mean, it has always 
seemed to me that that is the 
case, and a lot of my friends talk 
about it, but to be perfectly hon
est, I havent experienced any 
department other than my own, 
so I really cant say that I have 
anything to compare. I begin to 
rationalize it ... of course some 
departments have been neglected, 
right?
I mean, there was that flap 
about the glass studios last year, 
and people keep complaining 
about the quality of life, and there 
is an editorial every week in The 
Tartan, so somebody must have 
complained about it at some point, 
right? right!
In any case, I dont know 
whether or not departments have 
been neglected, but I say it any
way. The next thing I know I am 
having this fantasy about the new 
president sitting in his office, lis
tening to WTAE, and hearing my 
comments. Suddenly the an
nouncer says that my comment is 
representative of major student

calls in protest are made to the by now. Another name spring: 
radio station, indignant faculty into my mind. Tadzio Sneed? 
members begin to single me out 
on the street, the school gets di
vided into rival camps of those 
who think that departments have 
been neglected, and those who do 
not, there are demonstrations on 
both sides, concept art pieces are 
done on the subject and banned 
by the administration, The Tar

the controversy for a few weeks 
and then we all sink into well 
deserved obscurity.
Then it happens. Handed to me 
on a silver platter. The man asks, 
And what is your name? I feel 
that my day-mare can be ren
dered neuter, all I have to do is 
give him a false name. What do I 
say? The first name that pops into 
my head is Robert Smith, no, 
too obvious, and I dont wear lip
stick anyway. There is a painful 
moment of hesitation. The man 
pushes the microphone closer in. 
If it had been fiber optic, I would
cant tell the man my name ii 
Tadzio Sneed, hell see righ 
through that! The tension buildi!! 
and I say it, quickly, without 
thinking.
My name is javiergrillo-jn

The man smiles, shuts off thetape recorder and books out o 
Skibo before the word retraction* 
crosses my mind. I go home, dread;' 
visions of negative publicity i$j 
my mind. Assuming the fetaj;; 
position in an unwelcoming bed, f; 
slip into uneasy dreams.
Later that day WTAE reported 
the opinions of several student? 
including one Harvey Gigioft 
marzooch. I smile, and, thaf 
night, over the phone, I thank m#! 
parents once more.

Fifteen people pack themselves into a stairwell so narrow and 
tight that theres barely room to breath, let alone shoot a movie. 
Within the last minute the words excuse me are heard well 
over a dozen times.
Lost somewhere in the mob are cameras, lights, and huge 
screens which loom over the crowd and are carefully avoided. A 
technician arrives on the set and mutters Oh Lord before 
entering into the fray. The sounds of people shouting, jackets 
rubbing together, and radio static fill the air.
The place is a total madhouse.
But suddenly the words quiet on the set cut through the 
chaos like a hot knife. Within moments the set is as quiet as a 
crypt and the cameras start rolling. The only sounds are the 
voices of the actors and the rolling of the cameras. If it werent 
for the cold steam emitting from each persons mouth on the set, 
youd think that they were dead.
However, three takes later Director Andy Wolk shouts, Okay 
everyone, that was good. Lets get some lunch.
Instantly the frenzy returns.
Equipment starts to come down, people begin pouring out of 
the room as fast as they can, and the decibel level triples. But 
not everyone is a part of the hysteria. Standing in the middle of 
the abandoned hall is an amazed Jennifer Grey.
You guys just want to go to lunch. You dont care if this was 
good or bad! exclaims Grey. However, Wolk strolls over to Grey, 
says something to her, she smiles, and the two walk out with the 
rest of the crowd.
Such was the scene last Tuesday night in a Bloomfield neigh
borhood during the shooting of HBOs new film Criminal Justice. 
Written and directed by Wolk, a Carnegie Mellon alumnus, 
Criminal Justice examines the workings of the New York justice 
system. The film stars Jennifer Grey, Forrest Whittaker, Rosie 
Perez, and Anthony LaPaglia and is tentatively scheduled to air 
in the fall.

For Wolk, returning to Pittsburgh was a homecoming. To 
come back directing a movie in Pittsburgh that I wrote is great, 
said Wolk while eating lunch. Its a great way to come back, Im 
not coming back with my tail between my legs, but instead Im 
coming back succeeding in what I set out to do. Its great.
As for filming in Pittsburgh, as opposed to Brooklyn where the

story takes place, Wolk had noth
ing but praise for the city. The 
people of Pittsburgh could not be 
more cooperative. The people, the 
city, the federal government.... 
Pittsburgh is so hospitable they 
make it much more attractive to 
film here than in New York.
During the rest of lunch Wolk 
related of how he came up with 
the concept of Criminal Justice. 
I was on a murder jury in Man
hattan, and it was a crack murder 
that took place in Harlem and it 
was a very intense experience. 
During his serving as juror Wolk 
, became totally absorbed in the 
: justice system and its workings. 
It totally took over my life and 
consumed me.
About the same time his jury 
duty was wrapping up, HBO 
, executives came to Wolk and said 
; that they wanted to do a project 
i with him. I told them this story 
about my jury experience, and 
: they were very interested. The 
I rest is history.
At that time Wolk turned to his 
assistant and began talking about 
the next scene that \% as going to 
1 be shot.
It was to be the opening scene of 
; the film and would require over 
; four hours of set up time; Wolk 
! said he considered it the most 
complex scene in the film. Con' sidering that the time was a little 
; after 7 pm (movie makers dont 
start their day until the after; noon) and lunch wouldnt be over 
' until around 8, that would put 
; shooting time well past midnight.
On top of the four hour set up 
! time, the temperature was slowly 
! dropping into the teens and it was 
lightly snowing. It looked like it 
was going to be a cold, long night 
for the cast and crew of Criminal 
Justice.
Murphys Law
Over the next four hours the set 
began to slowly take shape. Tracks 
were laid on the street for the 
camera to smoothly slide across.
If you didnt know any better, youd 
think you were in Brooklyn.
Dirt and litter was placed in the 
streets to give the area a big city 
feel. Cars with New York license 
plates were brought in and parked 
on the streets. Graffiti was 
painted on every square inch of 
wall available. Even New York 
Post newspaper boxes were set up 
on the streets (graffiti and all). If 
you didnt know any better, youd 
think you were in Brooklyn.
As the night wore on, the tem
perature continued to fall, as well 
as the snow. The film was origi
nally supposed to take place in 
May, said Wolk. But we turned 
the clock back six months when 
we began shooting, so now the 
film takes place in November. 
Its a good thing, for the film would 
have looked rather odd with 
people seeing their breath in May.
During the set up everyone was 
constantly running around, al
ways having something to do. As 
a matter of fact, the only people 
who didnt have anything to do 
were the actors themselves.
Some just sat around talking, 
some were in makeup, while oth
ers went to wardrobe to get some 
warmer clothes. They just ran 
out of earmuffs, Perez informs 
some fellow actors.
As midnight neared, huge lights 
were set up and turned on, mak
ing the street so bright it almost 
appeared to be daytime. The street 
was constantly sprayed with wa
ter, giving it a glossy appearance. 
A fire was started in a trash can, 
both for warmth and for the next 
shot. And the temperature con
tinues to fall.
Finally midnight arrived and 
the set was ready. The scene to be 
shot was not the opening scene, 
but instead a scene right after the 
opening scene, where Perez was 
first discovered with her face 
slashed. Suddenly a strong gust 
of wind whipped through the set
and ripped a gel off one of the 
lights. Some of the crew moaned, 
for it would take at least twenty 
minutes to fix. The wait went on.
Half an hour later the light was 
fixed and the actors got into place. 
Everything was set. Ready! cried 
one of the stagehands. Everyone 
got quiet. The filming was about 
to start.
Unbelievable! shouted the 
cameraman. Suddenly he dropped 
to his knees and looked at the bot
tom of the camera. That stupid 
battery!
Crew members ran back and 
forth from the camera to a trailer 
a few blocks down, always carry
ing various items. Five minutes 
later the scene was all ready. 
Ready! shouted the same stage
hand again. I held my breath.
Everything finally worked and 
the scene went as planned. Wolk 
did a few more takes and then 
called a break. I asked him how 
much longer before the main 
opening shot was to be filmed. 
Oh, not much longer now. Maybe 
one, two hours. And the tem
perature continued to fall.
Thats a Wrap
The opening scene was eventu
ally shot, at around three in the 
morning. It took around six hours 
and over forty people to set up, 
several thousands of dollars  
and all for just a minutes time on 
the big screen.
Pittsburgh is becoming the 
Hollywood of the East, remarked 
Wolk. He was pleased, even after 
all the evenings troubles  the 
cold weather, the snow, the longer 
than anticipated set up time  
Wolk was all smiles. Directing is 
a wonderful thing.
Indeed it is. For that one magi
cal and hectic night, a little bit of 
Brooklyn came to Pittsburgh.

Director Tony Bill talks Tinseltown
By A.S. GOLDMAN
Tartan Staffwriter
Hollywood  in the microcosmic, entertainment-mecca sense 
.  has always been run on contra
dictions. Peel back the layers of 
cash, deals, and unreturned phone 
calls and what will be exposed is 
a perpetual motion machine fu
elled by the tension of incessant 
self-negation, doublespeak and an 
aggressive disregard for consis
tency. Day and night the machine 
sputters and grinds, feeding on 
its own output and an endless 
series of simultaneous yesses and 
noes.
In Hollywood, every love-emand-leave-em (remember Mark 
, Hamill?) is juxtaposed with a 
;hate-em-but-keep-em-aroundanyway (Cher, Dan Aykroyd). To 
I the same extent, every glamorous 
public persona has his or her 
insidious or kinky private side 
(Joan Crawford, Rock Hudson).
Hip filmmakers rally round the 
noble-cause-of-the-hour, inevita
bly draining the impact of racism, 
homelessness, and other wellexploited issues that currently go 
unaddressed right there in the 
studios and in lovely downtown 
Burbank.
This is Tinseltown.
This is also what producer/di
rector Tony Bill would call an 
overblown accusation. Of course, 
Bill  who is in town to promote 
his latest directorial effort, Crazy 
People  is a contradiction in his 
own right.
The Academy Award-winner 
(Best Producer for The Sting) has 
an eye for funny, innovative 
scripts, yet in conversation he 
relies heavily on platitudes like 
Comedy is a very, very fine line, 
and Making movies is about life.  
He is at once a truly imaginative
guy and a walking clich: part 
Notre Dame English-art student, 
part Hollywood stereotype. For
tunately, more ofthe former comes 
across.
During his stint as a producer 
through much of the seventies, 
Bill was partially responsible for 
the brilliant Taxi Driver as well 
as a forgettable (and forgotten) 
comedy called Harry and Walter 
Go toNew York. His eighties work 
as a director includes the bitter
sweet gem My Bodyguard along 
with the positively saccharine Six 
Weeks.
Crazy People, which was writ
ten by Mitch Markowitz of Good 
Morning, Vietnam fame, incorpo
rates the best and worst of Bills 
ambivalent style  in terms of 
comedy it is innovative and basi
cally a riot, but thematically it 
lacks freshness and credibility.
Crazy People is the story of a 
stressed-out advertising execu
tives revolutionary (and quite 
hilarious) truth-in-advertising 
campaign. Emory Leesons (Dud
ley Moore) slogan for Jaguar 
automobiles stresses the carowners chances of getting 
handjobs from beautiful women 
you hardly know, and his print 
ads for United Airlines point out 
that more United flyers get to 
their destination alive. While the 
advertisements are definitely big 
laughs, as Bill likes to call them, 
and many of the performances 
are excellent, the movies ap
proach to the you can beat the 
odds if you really try message is 
tired and even deceptively naive. 
Th same type of illusions of 
American life that Emory sets out 
to dissolve with his ads are part of 
the movies sitcomish theme.
Bill insists that Crazy People is 
not dishonestly optimistic. 
Theres a difference between
honesty and truth, and theres a 
difference between honesty and 
reality, and a difference between 
reality and dramatic truth, he 
says.
While Bill will grant that Crazy 
People is perhaps a little too 
conventional at points, he de
fends the use of somewhat hack
neyed subject matter in the pur
suit of a larger goal. At a certain 
point youre not doing a documen
tary, he argues. I think every 
good story, every good movie, 
every good novel has to have some 
sort of theme, and thats what you 
try to be true to. The story tends 
to serve that theme, and in the 
service of that theme everything 
gets perhaps exaggerated or not 
exaggerated enough in some 
cases.
The theme of Crazy People, as 
Bill sees it, is honesty and truth: 
What would happen if everybody 
was more truthful in their own 
lives, in their own relationships.... 
What would happen if people just 
said what was really on their 
mind?
In the service of this theme, 
though, Crazy People relies on 
plot devices that have gone stale 
long ago, such as the traditional 
prick-turned-niceguy character 
development (Paul Reiser), the 
individual-versus-big-business 
struggle, and the Fm-sorry-Ididnt-believe-you romantic di
lemma. While these conventions 
that are adhered to certainly do 
not rob the movie of its charm and 
wit, they seem at odds with Bills 
assertion that he is attracted to 
newness and originality and 
freshness.
Im attracted to something that 
is more than meets the eye, Bill 
says. Its not just the story thats 
being told; it has larger ramifica
tions. However, what does meet
Ron Phillips/1990 Paramount Pictures Corporation 
alIA K2FF #F4N8 s2,4o8r :esF4A nll,4 se,2I0 8D4 N2Fu2I0 lN8D4 I4T Mw,wuleI8 olu4sA tmNyw fulFSui
the eye is what works best in 
Crazy People: Reisers and J.T. 
Walshs performances, Mark
owitzs extremely clever mockadvertisments, and Bills comic 
timing as a director. Bill was wary 
of keeping the comedy under 
control, though, stressing that it 
cant just be a skit movie. We 
could have strung together even 
more commercials, but it would 
have just ended up being a skit. 
Bill also is sensitive to other 
aspects of comedy, especially those 
concerning how tasteful a joke 
or scene is. I worry about it all 
the time, he says. I always 
address myself to it. I dont say 
cOh, fuck it  I dont care what 
[the producers] think.... I worry
about stoopinglow to get a laugh. 
In the case of a scene in Crazy 
People in which an executive 
admits to having abnormal sex
ual tendencies, Bill says Thats a 
big, big laugh. Its really funny, 
but I really worried about that. I 
basically end up trusting my own 
taste.
Bills tastes, as it turns out, are 
both trustworthy and contradic
tory  he is a Hollywood guy in 
that sense. Crazy People is funny, 
but the film works in spite of, 
rather than in accordance with, 
the obvious and corny plot devel
opments that Bill himself ap
proves of; he incorporates the 
fresh and the rancid, giving both 
his okay.
But if Bill seems to be acting 
out the Hollywood stereotype^ 
lapsing occasionally into cliches 
and spewing pre-fab comments 
like Im interested in people, 
the earnestness and intelligence 
of his overall demeanor are charm
ingly un-Hollywood. Like his 
movie he is a commingling of the 
funny and the embarrassingly 
trite, with his sense of humor 
maintaining the upper hand. .
In a town of contradictions, Tony 
Bill is no exception. Thats not 
such a terrible thing, though, as 
he points out: Its like electrons: 
if you have a plus and a minus its 
not so bad. Sure, its a dopey 
simile, but hes being sincere.

Becoming Memories takes its final bow
: By DAWN BROSONSKI
t* Tartan Asst. Diversions Editor 

p The memories of ones childr "hood, of ones family, can be some
* the most beautiful treasures of 
life. They can also be reminders of 
;reme sorrow and suffering. 
Talented playwright Arthur 
iron has woven precious, unforittable moments in the lives of 
iree generations of families into 
is marvelous play, Becoming 
'Memories, which opened at the 
jTJEittsburgh Playhouse March 21 
foahd closed Sunday.
~The intimacy of the Theatre 
35ownstairs at the Playhouse is 
PSne perfect choice for the return of 
r; Girons show. Becoming Memoes was last shown in Pittsburgh 
the Pittsburgh Public Theatre 
der the direction of Lee 
ankowich.
' This time around, director Teri 
pKlcIntyre (also the Playhouse

K3pntbz n3nit3yS The story of three generations of families in 
various locations in the Midwest from 1911 to the present. Directed by 
Teri McIntyre. Starring Colleen Delany, Stacey Masel, Joe Pedulla, Rick 
Reifenstein, Michele Schmitt, and Brenda Walker. The show ran at the 
Pittsburgh Playhouse March 21 through April 8.
overall warmth and tenderness 
of this show.
Girons smooth, heartfelt, bru
tally honest words read like the 
pages of a diary. These charac
ters become so real, so alive 
through what they say, that they 
become the true heart of this show, 
which is the way it should be. The 
care and love Giron must have 
had for those who inspired these 
characters becomes quite obvious 
throughout the show.
Becoming Memories is a chal
lenge for any actor or director, 
since the script requires each actor 
to play multiple roles, changing 
frequently from scene to scene. 
The effect must be striking, while 
the audience must be able to fol
low who is who.
A genuine delight, therefore, is 
the exceptional talent of this cast, 
all members of the Point Park 
College Theatre Company. This 
cast triumphs in creating clearly 
distinct characters and their skills 
are showcased when they must 
rely on only a pair of glasses or a 
shawl or pajamas to indicate a 
change in age.
Every member of this ensemble 
deserves high praise. Extremely 
memorable performances were
delivered by Joe Pedulla as Os
car, Stacey Masel as Sophie, 
Michele Schmitt as Rosina, and 
Colleen Delany as Hannah.
So many moments in this show 
are gems in their own right. Rich
ard Reifenstein as Albert and 
Robin Gibson as Linda were 
remarkable as father and daugh
ter struggling to carry on when 
the mother, Rosina, dies. One of 
the most tender and heartbreak
ing moments in the show involves 
Linda as a grown woman visiting 
Albert in a rest home. Albert, who 
treated Rosina with much less 
than tenderness while she was 
alive, now confesses his wrongs 
against her to Linda, who for
gives him, while Rosina watches 
from the side, glowing with love, 
not regret.
Pedullas Oscar and Scott 
Thewes Michael are an absolute 
joy to watch as grandfather and 
grandson in their rendition of The 
Little Goat; the night I saw the 
show the song had audience 
members roaring with laughter, 
and they rewarded the actors with 
tremendous applause.
The set itself relies on simplic
ity, a perfect balance to the com
plexity of the cast genealogy. The
play takes place in various loca
tions in the Midwest from 1911 to 
the present, and the audience is 
transported to these places 
through simple, fluid changes and 
reuse of props: a trunk becomes 
the hood of a car; a swing in the 
back of a house descends from the 
ceiling; a kitchen becomes a din
ing room; and so on.
The skills of the production staff 
are unquestionable. Many com
plements to McIntyre and stage 
manager Jamie Halerz, a fresh
man theatre arts major at Point 
Park, for paying so much atten
tion to the all-important extras, 
like music, effects, and changes 
in scene.
Acknowledgement also goes to 
Costume Designer Joan Markert, 
a graduate of CMU, Lighting 
Designer Cindy Limauro, a 
teacher of lighting design at CMU, 
Musical Director Loren Van 
Brenk, and Set Designer Tracey 
Truax, resident properties de
signer at the Playhouse.
Thanks to these people, among 
countless others, it is easy to for
get during Becoming Memories 
that you are sitting in a theatre, 
for you are there, watching as 
various characters do during the 
show, observing and sharing the 
joy and pain as Giron gently pulls 
you from one extreme to the other.
Therefore, when the lights fade 
for the final time, it is assured 
that you do not want to leave; 
rather, Becoming Memories has 
accomplished a goal by making 
the audience wish to remain, to 
remember, no matter how pain
ful or joyous.

Discover the difference between rock and pop
Is rock journalism necessary? 
. And if it is, does it have to suck? 
Im not worried about biting the 
hand that feeds me because I dont 
i get paid, and anyway, Im not a 
rock journalist, Im a pop colum
nist. The distinction is an impor
tant one, because while a Rock 
Journalist will do his damndest 
to convince the rest of the world 
) that Guns N Roses are making 
an important statement with their 
were morons and bigots pose, I  
the Pop Columnist  am just in 
the business to call Madonna a 
silly slut as often as possible. Silly 
j) slut, silly slut, silly slut, silly slut.
There are other important dis
tinctions, though, that need to be 
addressed before this column can 
go any further in its quest to 
expose stupidity and tasteless| ness wherever they may appear 
in the Pop Universe (see last is
sue.) One prominent difference 
between the Rock Journalist and
BLUES, ELVIS, AND 
SOMEBODY ELSES 
FAVORITE SONG
by A. S. Goldman
the Pop Columnist is in the area 
of style. While the Rock Journal
ist uses lofty prose in an attempt 
to elevate a given band or album 
to the level of art  thereby 
justifying his existence as a wouldbe art criticthe Pop Columnist 
just tries to examine the contra
dictions, fallacies and absurdities 
that are inherent in the Pop 
Universe, in a way that is satiri
cal and informed (basically, a
smug wise-ass who likes to call 
Madonna a silly slut.) But, here
 let me provide a few examples.
In a review of The Chills Sub
marine Bells album, Spins Rock 
Journalist Evelyn McDonnell 
refers to songwriter Martin Phillipps as rocks most precise enunciator, pronouncing every sibilant 
and aspirate. Although theres 
nothing I admire more in a folkpunk band than clear pronun
ciation, I feel as if it is not some
thing I (the Pop Columnist) would 
have chosen to write about. Nor 
would I have interpreted 
Madonnas July 13, 1987 Whos 
That Girl Tour Madison Square 
Garden show the same way Roll
ing Stones Vince Aletti did.
In true Rock Journalist fash
ion, Aletti gives meaning when 
there is no meaning there. Allud
ing to the Silly Sluts lack of a 
credible and substantial image, 
the Rolling Stone critic says She
makes the most of our curiosity, 
even our skepticism; without 
pinning down the real Madonna, 
she parades enough personas 
across the stage to impress us 
with the impossibility of choosing 
just one. Vince, is it okay if I 
choose none?
Another Rock Journalism main
stay is the ubiquitous invocation 
of embarrassingly overused unof
ficial titles given to pop personali
ties. I recoil in pain every time I 
read about The Ex-Chief of Po
lice (Sting), or His Royal Bad
ness (Prince.) I need not even 
credit sources for these quotes, 
since they appear in Rolling Stone, 
Musician, People Magazine, and 
Spin with disturbing frequency. 
A big mystery is why the moniker 
Rocks Angry Young Man con
tinues to accompany Elvis 
Costellos name (a practice fol
lowed religiously since 1978) 
whenever he appears in a maga
zine  he may still be angry, but 
hes 35 years old.
I have a recommendation for 
magazines that insist on invent
ing silly titles for musicians: get 
new ones. Like, now that youve 
exhausted Boy Toy, and the 
Material Girl, why not start 
referring to Madonna asI dont 
know  the Silly Slut?
This is not to say that the Pop 
Columnist doesnt resort to any 
form of name-calling. Certainly 
not! Its just that while your 
standard Musician reporter will 
unerringly call Talking Heads 
frontman David Byrne Rocks 
Renaissance Man (a title initi
ated by a Time Magazine cover 
story and perpetuated by Byrnes 
sycophants everywhere else), I 
would probably choose to describe 
the head Head (thats cute) as 
Rocks Pretentious, Self-Con
sciously Eccentric Geek. See, 
theres a difference.
Well, I think we all have a clear 
understanding of the distinctions 
between the Rock Journalist and 
me, the Pop Columnist. I dont 
want anyone to get the idea that 
theres any jealousy involved here
 thats just not so. Sure, they 
get to work at Rolling Stone for 
real salaries and get backstage at 
real concerts  not to mention 
interviewing mega-popular mu
sicians on a regular basis for 
money  but think of what I get 
to do. Any Rolling Stone reporter 
would give his autographed Eric 
Clapton collection to be able to 
call Madonna a silly slut. Thats 
power.
Next time: Rickie Lee Jones 
asks her Philadelphia audience 
the intriguing question: Did you 
pay a lot of money to come here 
and yell during this fucking song?

A review unfolds over toast and beer
By WILLIAM BURKY
iTartan Calendar Editor 
& GRANT CARMICHAEL
*Tartan Contributing Editor
- Here we are, Grant and Bill.
Eating some semi-burnt Giant 
;;Eagle toast and listening to live 
"Genesis. You know why? Thats 
"right... because we just got back 
"from the Joe Walsh concert, and 
-nothing makes you desire toast 
more than beer.
 Grant (Joe Walsh fan): What do 
y/e do now?
; Bill (Likes some Joe Walsh stuff 
Sometimes): Talk about it.
 Grant: O.K. Lets see. I loved it.
Bill: (yawn).
" Grant: You have to admit, it 
was a fun concert.
Bill: Yeah, it was fun. Im just 
glad I didnt pay for it.
; Grant: When was the last time 
you saw this intimate a concert?
Bill: You mean that it was at 
ihe Syria Mosque and was not

March 29, at Syria Mosque.
even sold out?
Grant: All the better. Those fans 
were really into it!
Bill: Well, I dont understand 
why. I mean Joe Walsh was play
ing pretty good, but the music 
was just what you would have 
expected, and the bass player and 
drummer were just so-so.
Grant: Still, I found it more raw 
(I mean I really enjoy raw). It 
wasnt like a choreographed, pre
dictable show that yielded no 
surprises. It was Joe and his gui
tar, and thats what I came to see 
(O.K. O.K.... and his bass player 
and drummer ... but thats not 
important).
Bill: It just seemed to lack origi
nality. Sure, I like Joe Walsh, and
I listened to some of his songs 
before the concert, and I was ac
tually starting to look forward to 
it. We had had some brewskis and 
got there late and still we waited 
an hour to see an hour and a 
quarter show.
Grant: Lacked originality?!!? 
First, w6 got to see an original 
songwriter of the Eagles open up 
before Joe. What was his name?
Bill: I dont know. He sucked.
Grant: Well I thought it was a 
good intro.
Bill: But you took the opportu
nity to go the mens room.
Grant: Nothing could have 
stopped me then, not even Metallica.
Bill: No doubt.
Grant: Well it was a piece of 
history. Second, he could have 
just played the songs verbatim 
from the albums, but no ... he 
pulled out a trombone to accent 
the solo of Rocky Mountain Way. 
Thats what I enjoy from a musi
cian; spontenaity, humor, and a 
willingness to try different things 
with an established rock anthem.
Bill: Yeah, whatever. How about 
another piece of toast?
Grant: O.K.
(pause)
Bill: So you think hes a good 
performer because of one-liners 
like Why is toilet paper square 
when you ass is round, or Why 
do basketball players wear tennis 
shoes?
Grant:, I think bringing these 
cosmic relevancies to the song 
Lifes been Good is very appro
priate and sheds some light on 
the true essence of this song, one 
he suggests should become the 
new national anthem.
Bill: O.K. Well what about 
ILBTs (I Like Big Tits)? I came 
to this show hoping to hear it 
because its a really cool song (at 
least on tape). The backbeat pi
ano sounds like its being played 
in some old fashioned tavern, and
its just a really fun experience. 
But in concert, that was all miss
ing. It was just a drab song with 
out-of-the-ordinary lyrics.
Grant: So you expected a regur
gitation of what was on tape?
Bill: I expected to hear some of 
the things that made me at all 
interested in seeing Joe Walsh in 
concert.
Grant: Like piano? Come on, 
Bill. I mean its a humorous song. 
Its not to be taken seriously, af
ter all, it could really piss some 
feminist groups off. Anyway, the 
crowd liked it, male and female!
Bill: Its not that I didnt like it. 
I mean, Id much rather hear that 
than, say, Millie Vannili. It just 
wasnt as catchy as I had hoped.
Grant: Its the sort of song thats 
only dear to a core group of fans. 
Joe is trying to entertain his fans. 
After all, hes not supporting any 
album. He just did this for his 
fans (or a few bucks).
Bill: I think trying is the key
word here. Anyhow, I would hav 
to give the Joe Walsh concert a 
well if not a thumbs down, aI 
least a distinct sideways.
Grant: Thumbs up. I was thor
oughly entertained, even on my 
feet. But I agree its an acquired 
taste. This is my third time, so J 
knew how hed approach th 
audience. I think some peopl 
wouldnt appreciate his casual 
(very casual), wacky style. J
Bill: Well, Id rather see a true 
artist like Stevie Ray Vaughn anjr 
day.
Grant: I think a true artisj 
would be more in the likes of 
Segovia. Although we really 
couldnt see him (a)live. But hej 
... Stevie, Satriani, Malmsteeril 
Beck, whatever. Maybe our next 
review well agree on something!
Final Tally:
Grant, Thumbs up. Bill, Sort of 
sideways.
You be the judge. Se ya next 
time.
Exploring the world of the comic book character
I Salaam.
Do you ever get the feeling that, 
somehow, your life is being 
Scripted? Think about it: all the 
people in your life are characters 
in your very own personalized 
novel. Its an ongoing drama of 
[subplots that grow and culminate 
into major events. Somehow 
ithings just happen, decisions are 
made that make the script more 
and more complex as time goes by 
and the storylines in our lives 
converge and diverge as every day 
Jwere alive moves the drama on a 
little bit further. I guess that 
[would make God the writer, 
wouldnt it? I mean if anybody 
could script five billion lives for;ever it would take somebody like 
God to do it.
The question of whether the 
ript has already been completed 
or each and every one of us, or 
lether God gets in next weeks 
ory lines in a week before we 
ive them out is up for debate, but 
s the gist of this numbing idea,
' life imitating art, of life being 
rt, which has found a home in a 
loroughly enchanting comic book 
ailed Animal Man.
COMIC RELIEF
by Waseem Hussain
The central character Animal 
Man, a fervent animal rights 
activist and vegetarian, becomes 
conscious of the fact that he is a 
comic book character. He feels 
violated because his life is being 
turned upside down (his family 
was recently murdered) for the 
entertainment of total strangers, 
we the readers. Imagine that; 
what if there are people who try 
to get away from their dreary 
world for a little while by reading 
about your life on a monthly ba
sis! What if you only really exist 
once a month for 32 pages! What 
if were all trees in the forest fall
ing and making sounds only when 
there are people to hear it? Yeesh.
If you thought that was weird,
you aint seen nothing yet. Once 
upon a time a child was bom, his 
entire body tattooed with hiero
glyphics. Now, the boy has grown 
into a man and is on the run from 
a sinister cult. The cult is no ordi
nary cult; it lives in the ghost of a 
German town called Numheim. 
The ghost of the dead town dis
guises itself by hiding in pictures, 
postcards, or even comic books. 
How does it get from the ghost 
town into our world? Thats sim
ply done by coming through the 
gash on a humans body that gets 
bigger and bigger as more agents 
of the cult make their way into 
our world! Yikes.
But what does the cult want 
with the man who is known as the 
Word Made Flesh? The hiero
glyphics on his body hold the code 
for bringing forth the AntiGod! 
Anti God!?! Well, according to the 
beliefs of the cult, it all goes back 
to the first moment of creation, 
when God became self-aware and 
said... Let there be Light! That 
first light of creation cast the first 
shadow, and the shadow was 
Gods own ... the AntiGod, the 
Decreator, says Willoughby

Kipling, the jolly alcoholic oc
cultist whose summoned the 
Doom Patrol to help save the 
world. The Doom Patrol, made up 
of characters ranging from a lady 
with 64 multiple personalities to 
a floating hermaphroditic 
mummy, face their most interest
ing challenge ever this week in 
Doom Patrol #32.
Where oh where do these unbe
lievably weird ideas come from? 
They come from the extremely 
talented writer Grant Morrison, 
who has taken Doom Patrol as 
well as Animal Man and made 
them into the two best comic books 
currently being published.
The art in both books is an 
acquired taste, but dont let the 
fact that the art isnt instantly 
likeable stop you from reading 
some of the most offbeat, creative 
stories to be written in years. 
Morrison is making comic books 
history with every issue. When 
all is said and done, his Doom 
Patrol andAnimal Man will rank 
with Frank Millers Daredevil, 
Alan Moores Swamp Thing, and 
other books that are destined for 
the Comic Book Hall of Fame in
Canton, Ohio.
If youre down at the comic store 
this week and want to pick up 
some other reading that wont 
quite get into the Hall of Fame 
along with the latest issues of 
Animal Man and Doom Patrol 
(look for the best cover on the 
stand!), there are some other gems 
that came in this week. One of 
which is Action Comics, the old
est and still one of the best comic 
books on the market, still going 
strong after more than fifty years 
of Superman stories.
This, along with its companion 
books Superman and Adventures 
of Superman, are three books 
which have redefined Superman 
and the thoroughly interesting 
supporting cast into some of the 
most human characters in comic 
books. This month begins a sub
plot which readers have been 
waiting for forever: a romance 
between Clark Kent and Lois 
Lane! Gosh, thats sweet.
Marvel starts their summer 
annuals with the four part 
LifeForm storyline, a bizarre 
lifeform infects a human being, 
and evolves into a powerful sen
tient menace, known as (gasp!). 
LifeForm! Its silly, but if your^ 
a complete list then youd want tdi 
pick up Punisher Annual #3. j 
really hate what Marvels beeii 
doing with their annuals of latejj 
They give you 32 pages of above 
average story and then fill it upj 
with third string back up storie^ 
for the other 32 pages, and therj 
they charge you double for em* 
No fair! Revolt!
Also make sure to be on the 
lookout for Concrete Celebrate& 
Earth Day. Its all new, color; 
$3.50, and features the talents of 
Paul Chadwick, Moebius, anqj 
Charles Vess. Save the enviorn-| 
ment! Buy it! I wonder what God 
thinks of all this. Wait a second^ 
hes probably the one who thought 
of it all in the first place! What!*^

"Dollars for Choice"
"Dollars for Choice" is the fund-raising 
effort to enable BERG FOR GOVERNOR to 
convey the following message to others 
throughout the Commonwealth:
Democratic candidate, Phil Berg states 
that: "There should be no government inter
vention in a woman's reproductive rights.
It is not the PRO-CHOICE objective to 
demand that every unwanted pregnancy is 
to be terminated by abortion. It is the anti
choice position to insist, unequivocally, that 
every unwanted pregnancy be maintained.
even against the will of the woman involved.
We are concerned with all of our Civil 
Rights, which are as American as apple pie, 
baseball and PRO-CHOICE!"
"Dollars for Choice" will educate and 
register the disenchanted and disillusioned 
individuals who represent 40%-50% of our 
potential electorate who are unregistered 
and also advise them of the importance of 
this election to reaffirm our basic Constitu
tional rights.
F? I want to help PHIL BERG become GOVERNOR of Pennsylvania:

The album stands up to living room 
listening, but not quite as well. The 
main benefit of listening at homeis 
that the music can be louder with
out worrying about ambulances "pr 
pursuing cop cars.
Second runner-up is the Jungle 
Brothers (the jungle, the jungle, the 
brothers, the brothers) and their new 
Done In By The Forces of Nature LP, 
or at least the first half of it. From 
the De La Soul school of thought 
(meaning there is some), the recojd 
has a fine collection of beats a$d 
bites and some okay raps too. (Dr1 
should that be rapps, although the 
only person that actually spells it 
that way is the guy down at the 
Collectors Twelve-Inch in Oakland.) 
The LPs long, as in over fifty min
utes (another trend started by De La 
Soul?), although most of it fits nicely I 
on a tape with Third Bass The Cac
tus Album, a record equally good,if 
not better than, the JBs wax.
Third runner-up is the garbled 
FM radio signal you get while driv-i 
ing through the mountains on the I 
Pennsylvania Turnpike. Nobeat(npt 
a constant one, anyway), but lots pf 
distortion.
Incidentally, Third Bass is going 
to be in town in a week and a day 
along with Big Daddy Kane and

MUSIC IN REVIEW
by Dan Bidwa
Having driven a few hundred miles 
over spring break, and having spent 
an even greater amount of time 
trying to fix the car so that I could 
continue to drive those miles, I feel 
exceptionally qualified to offer a few 
choice suggestions for new driving 
music. That means music to play 
while you are driving, not music 
with a loud beat, although the one 
does not preclude the other.
The winner of the break, hands 
down, determined by total mileage 
of wheel motion and tape movement, 
is Mudhoneys recent-album, clev
erly entitled Mudhoney. Objects of 
more industry hype than any other 
unknown band in recent history, and 
somehow still obscure in spite of it 
all, Mudhoney has proven that they 
can actually release more than two 
good songs at a time, although it 
takes a while to realize it. Not too 
many chords, some wah, lots of dis
tortion, way overblown, no big sur
prises anywhere just what makes 
for good music to drive to, especially 
since the slight diversion of dodging 
cars keeps you from listening too 
closely, which isnt such a bad thing.

Sinad OConnor makes a complete turnaround
By MICHELLE JONES
Tartan Staffwriter
I am not like I was before proclaims 
'Sinead OConnor near the beginning of 
her latest recording, I Do Not Want What 
"I Havent Got.
Most people agree. This latest effort 
<ioes at first sound like the work of a 
-completely different person. The voice is 
more controlled. Some of the subject mat
ter is topical, the speaker more conscien"tious. In the time between this and her 
"l&st album, OConnor reunited with, and 
then married, the father of her son, got
 into all sorts of weird stuff, including 
color therapy and numerology, calmed 
down, and discovered family life.
Great. What is Sinead OConnor, if not 
a mixture of angst and passion? I wor
ried that OConnors newly-found con
trol would border on complete repres1 "s'ion. My hand shook the first time I 
placed the new CD into my Discman. 
With trepidation I started listening. I 
kept one finger poised above the Pause 
button, just in case. Despite my pessi
mistic anxiety I made it through; eventu1 - ally I even relaxed and enjoyed the CD. 
OConnor sounded a lot like she did on 
The Thes Kingdom of Rain (Mind Bomb), 
j "1 did, however miss OConnors trade
mark style, the Kate Bush and Siouxsie'-esque vocals. I missed The Lion and the 
| Cobras wailing vocals. Not to worry, 
after hearing the CD several times, I 
found the old OConnor lurking beneath 
the surface, occasionally rising out of the

????SINEAD OCONNOR. I Do Not Want 
What I Havent Got. Ensign/Chrysalis Rec
ords.
new material.
A lot of the new album deals with rela
tionships either strained or already over. 
But not even this fixation can taint this 
recording.
The Emperors New Clothes opens 
with clicking drumsticks, then indus
trial-sounding guitar riffs. From this 
energetic opening the song becomes an 
obvious autobiographic statement. 
OConnor discusses the effects of success 
on her life: He thinks I just became 
famous/and thats what messed me up. 
Her love and devotion to her husband, 
who is incidentally her drummer: I cant 
bear to be in another city/one where you 
are not. Despite this mushy boyfriend/ 
girlfriend stuff that no one outside the 
couple really wants to hear, the song 
manages to be great. I have to listen to 
this one twice each time; the melody and 
syncopation are definitely infectious.
The Last Day of Our Acquaintance is 
good on the basis of the title alone. But 
this is also one song which does justice to 
OConnors vocal prowess. Accompanied 
solely by acoustic guitar (which she plays 
herself) for the better part of the song, 
she takes her time and exhibits what re
flection and peace of mind have done for
her. The song is hers 
and it is difficult to 
imagine her singing 
anything else or any
one else attempting 
this song.
This song is about a 
strained relationship 
(surprise), strained to 
the point where out
side intervention is 
necessary: I will meet 
you later in somebodys 
office/Tll talk but you 
wont listen to me.The 
equivocal nature of 
these lines works well.
By not specifying 
whether the couple 
consults a lawyer or a counselor the song 
encourages listeners to speculate and 
make conclusions for themselves. When 
it is later implied that the office was 
indeed of a lawyer: and we will meet later 
to finalize the details, the song is made 
even more effective.
I dont really like Nothing Compares 
2U, and not just because I despise cutesy 
manipulations of language like 2U. (I 
excuse UB40 and U2 because they mean 
things.)There are a few redeeming places 
where syncopation or intonation come 
through in this song. At other times, 
however, OConnor comes off sounding 
country-western, as opposed to bluesy or 
funky. I cant help thinking that shed 
probably do better with a more fastpaced, dance-oriented Prince compila

tion.
Jump in the River sounds a lot like 
some song on side B of The Lion and the 
Cobra that I cant remember right now. 
The guitar riffs are generic, mere back
ground for lyrics delivered in a hushed 
whisper. This song is so-so, at best: I 
thought I tasted of too many cigarettes/ 
but you tasted like wine: potentially 
good lines (maybe), but not in their pres
ent musical context. Jump in the Rivers 
subject matter and delivery are very 
adolescent. In other words, this ones a 
possible cross-over hit to un-hip radio 
stations.
You Cause as Much Sorrow is a bal
lad about a relationship still causing 
trouble though half of the couple is dead. 
An air of resigned despair tinged with
contradictoiy determination character
izes the lyrics. OConnor is in excellent 
form here.
Okay, enough of that relationship stull, 
on to social commentary. There are'a 
couple of these songs, Black Boys :gn 
Mopeds, and Three Babies, both haunt
ing. Three Babies is very calm, qui0t, 
and effective in its serenity.
Black Boys on Mopeds is a 3-minute, 
35-second lesson in the problems of 
today s Britain: Englands not the mythi
cal land of madame, George, and roses/ 
its the home of police who kill black boys 
on mopeds. The title and these lines 
refer to circumstances surrounding the 
death of Nicholas Bramble, which ihvolved London police. However, the softg 
also voices the widespread contempt for 
Maggie Thatcher and the threatened 
state of the former British Empire.
Haunting ideas, hip percussion, and 
soaring vocals work magic on I m 
Stretched on your Grave. OConnors 
voice feels like a delicate silk scarf caught 
in the wind, given shape and definitidh. 
The percussion sounds as if it miglit 
have been lifted from a track off the Fine 
Young Cannibals The Raw and the 
Cooked. I am Stretched on your Grave 
has the same effect as reading one/pf 
Edward Goreys book, with emotiqn 
replacing the element of wit.
All in all, I Do Not Want What I Havent 
Got is an album to acquire. Well worth 
the wait, it shows the new OConnor'in 
great form. If you dont have it, go out 
and get it.

Thursday, April 12Dr. Strangelove 
(Or, How I Learned to Stop 
Worrying and Love the Bomb)
If the Cold War is actually over, we can consider 
ourselves lucky that it ended with lots of flowery 
people-power lets-all-be-friends business instead of 
the darkly demented Armageddon presented in Dr. 
Strangelove. This pre-perestroika nuclear morality 
play features a surpassingly excellent cast, with the 
late Peter Sellers in three (yes, three) of his most 
brilliant roles.
Sellers plays the president of the U.S., a befuddled 
British colonel, and the eerie and disturbing inven
tor of the atom bomb. All three characters are dropdead funny, and Stanley Kubricks dark, cynical di
rection gives the entire film an ironic twist  we 
laugh, but we feel uneasy doing so.
Dr. Strangeloves cult reputation might put off 
some people who would otherwise enjoy it, so go 
anyway  dont prejudge the film just because you 
might have heard odd-looking folks talking about it 
late one night.

Friday, April 13Shocker
Although noted horror director Wes Craven may 
have made some bad movies in the past, this just 
isnt one of them. Shocker has an offbeat sense of 
humor and just enough of a real plot to entertain 
beyond the raw Guts, Gore, and F/X level.
Craven picked himself a marvelously nasty villain 
for Shocker, its Horace Pinker (Mitch Pileggi), a 
mass-murdering electrician who looks like the poster 
boy for lithium therapy. Pinker is sent to the chair for 
his crimes, and as we all know, in this sort of movie 
the authorities only get one mistake.
Shocker will scare the crap out of you, in all like
lihood, but its also a darned good movie. Dont let a 
little bit of fear scare you away.

Saturday, April 14Ghostbusters II
It had to happen sooner or later  in an otherwise 
carefully crafted and well planned spring movie 
schedule, SDC was bound to sneak in a clinker or 
two. Born the bastard child of Sequelmania and Hol
lywood Greed, Ghostbusters IIis a disappointment to 
fans of the original and a vindication to those who 
said, It wont be as good as the first one.
All our old friends are back again, or as far back as 
they could be dragged by their wallets. Bill Murray 
is here, with a performance that strongly suggests he 
wishes he werent. Ditto for co-stars Harold Ramis 
and Sigourney Weaver (who seems positively ane
mic  must have been all the time she spent trapped 
in that dog costume making the last one). Only Dan 
Aykroyd shows signs of life, and hes trapped on a 
sinking ship.
Skip over Ghostbusters II  if you watch Bobby 
Browns video of the theme song, youve pretty much 
surpassed the movie.

Sunday, April 15One Flew Over the Cuckoos 
Nest
After last weeks Chinatown, this is probably the 
best of the four (five? maybe? do I hear Batman!) 
films featuring Jack Nicholson on ABs theme Sun
days this spring. Nicholson plays R.P. McMurphy, a 
vibrant, maniacal figure in the midst of a lethargic, 
heavily drugged mental ward.
McMurphys rebellion against authority (in the 
person of Nurse Ratched, a truly demonic figure de
monically portrayed by the superb Louise Fletcher) 
pulls us into his world of nightmare and ecstasy, and 
we go along for the ride. Based on the bestselling 
novel by Ken Kesey, Cuckoos Nest also features 
Danny DeVito early in his film career.
Next week, Nicholson returns as a mafia hit-man 
married to Kathleen Turner in Prizzis Honor.
