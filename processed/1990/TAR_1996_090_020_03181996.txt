THE TARTAN
By ERIC SALZMAN
Tartan Personnel Manager
On an otherwise calm Friday after
noon, CMU President Robert Mehrabian 
shocked the University by announcing 
that he will retire in early 1997 due to 
personal reasons.
There are times in your life you have 
to make certain choices, Mehrabian 
said. My wife is in California. She went
there last summer. Her Dad _______
was very sick, so she went there 
to be with him when he died.
Right after that, her mom got 
very sick and had major sur
gery. With his wife choosing 
to remain in California to be 
with her mother, Mehrabian is 
going to join her. 1
Hes riot going to another 
institution, said Thomas McConomy, 
chairman of the Universitys Board of 
Trustees, in response to Mehrabians 
decision. I hate like the devil to see him 
leave. I think hes done a marvelous job 
here, he said.
Mehrabian reaffirmed McConomys 
claim about not going to another institu
tion. When youre the President of an 
institution like this, you cant be in the 
job market, he said. As of now, he has no 
idea of what he is going to do in Califor
nia.
It is unfortunate that President 
Metuabian has decided to leave Car
negie Mellon^ said Gina Schuyler, Stu
dent Body President. He has made sig
nificant contributions to CMUs devel
opment into a highly respected institu
tion, and he will be difficult to replace. 
Replacing a university president is no 
small task. McConomy said that a re
placement will most likely not be found 
this year. The search will be very broad. 
It will be outside and inside [the Univer
sity], he said. People within the UniThis is a great school... Im 
going to be really sorry to go.  
 Robert Mehrabian, 
President of CMU
versity will be considered as candidates, 
McConomy said, noting that the two 
most important questions to ask are 
who is qualified and who wants the job.
Mehrabian said that he currently plans 
to stay on board until his successor is 
found, but does not want to help in the 
search process. I dont think its appro
priate for a sitting President to be di
rectly involved in selecting his or her 
successor, he said. The trustees are in 
charge and the faculty will help with the 
search.
Referring to CMU as a great school, 
Mehrabian cited the University Center,
increased applications for freshmen ad
mission, and improved retention rates as 
some of the schools strongest develop
ments since he left his position as Dean of 
the College of Engineering at the Univer
sity of California at Santa Barbara to 
succeed Richard Cyert as University Presi
dent in 1990. In 1990, we lost 15.5 per
cent of our freshman.... This year were 
down to 9.8 percent, Mehrabian said. 
When Dr. Mehrabian came we had 
6,400 applications, and now 
were over 14,000, McConomy 
said. The increase in applica
tions to CMU has far surpassed 
the nations overall average in
crease in application for uni
versity admission. McConomy 
said that Mehrabians commitment to undergraduate educa
tion has been a strong factor in 
helping the Universitys reputation.
According to McConomy, He 
[Mehrabian] pressed very hard for us to 
do more counseling and advising. We 
feel that did a lot to improve the reten
tion rate.
As for the University Center, the con
struction of which Mehrabian has been 
involved with from the onset, every
thing will continue along schedule. I 
dont think this will have any effect on 
the center at all, said Ed Schatz, senior 
vice president in charge of the 
Universitys Centers construction.

reasons. He plans to join his wife, who is already living in California.
Senate appoints 
Student Body VP

Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Last Tuesday a controversial 
change was made in the Car
negie Mellon University stu
dent government as Elena 
Munoz, a junior social and deci
sion sciences major, was ap
pointed as the first vice presi
dent by Gina Schuyler, student 
body president.
The amendment to the Sen
ate bylaws and subsequent 
appointment of Munoz has 
sparked much debate about 
whether the vice president po
sition is necessary. In a stu
dent government where va
cant senate seats are a con
stant, Gregory Haverkamp, a 
former Student Senate Com
mittee Chairman and CMU 
industrial management 
graduate, said, I think [the 
vice president position] is 
pretty much useless. This just 
makes another position to be 
filled in a student government 
which already has too many 
vacancies.
Haverkamp believes that the 
large size of the student gov
ernment prevents it from meet
ing the needs of the student 
body, since much debate must 
take place within student gov
ernment before any actions can 
be made.
Arik Cohen, former Sena
tor, served with Haverkamp 
and also thinks that the sys
tem is flawed in representing 
student needs and will not 
improve with a vice president, 
especially in the allocation of 
funds from the student ac
tivities fee.
Haverkamp proposes that 
smaller, temporary commit
tees would better serve the stu
dent body. He said, I would 
keep [student government] 
small. In fact, I envision the 
main purpose of this standing 
body to find concerns from 
among the student body, and 
to find people to fill ad hoc 
committees to form solutions. 
If the matter is urgent, this 
body could easily start com
municating with the adminis
tration.
In contrast, Schuyler and 
members of the student gov
ernment argue that the vice 
president will only aid in bet
ter representing the student 
population.
Bryon Krug, academic af
fairs chairman, said, When 
student government involves 
more people, it will be able to 
represent a wider cross-sec
tion of the CMU population. If 
it involves a wider cross-sec
tion, it will be able to make 
decisions that are representa
tive of the students views of 
the issues, rather than being 
the views of a small faction of 
the CMU population.
In addition, Schuyler 
claims that too much of her

Dean overrules allocation decision
By CHRIS CANNON
Tartan Staffwriter
The First Church of Christ, 
Abortionist (FCCA) will be with
out office space in the University 
Center next year. Although the 
organization followed proper al
location procedure and was 
granted space by the University 
Center Allocation Board (UCAB), 
the boards decision was over
ruled by Dean of Student Affairs, 
Michael Murphy.
' In a March 1 letter to the FCCA, 
Murphy wrote, It is not incum
bent upon the University to allo
cate space to individuals whose 
focus is to callously denigrate or 
mock the views of others. 
Murphy gave an example of the 
FCCAs mocking and calousness.
The very name of the organiza
tion is indicative of this. It is 
difficult for me to conclude that 
[the name] serves any other pur
pose. ... I have received complaints 
about the group from individuals 
inside and outside the university 
community, Murphy said.
Executive Member of the 
FCCA, Erik Altmann, a computer 
science graduate student, doesnt 
understand Murphys stance 
against the group. I guess he 
doesnt like the idea that we are 
pro-abortion Christians. But I 
have to ask whether hes ever 
read Voltaire, or our web site for 
that matter. Altmann also had a 
unique perspective on the UCAB 
hearings. I represented FCCA 
at a hearing where I spent an 
hour and a half pointing out that
we are serious. Maybe if Murphy 
had been there he would have 
changed his mind.
The issue could tarnish the 
allocation process. FCCA sup
porter Chris Newman recalls 
when the Intervarsity Christian 
Fellowship (IVCF) wanted space 
in Skibo. Newman said, Murphy 
insisted that the IVCF get office 
space and insisted that he would 
treat all religions equally in terms 
of requirements to get office 
space. In contrast, Newman said, 
Along comes something that 
looks like a religion to me, and he 
outright rejected their office 
space. Newman, has called for 
Murphy to remove all space allo
cated to religious organizations.
Computer Science Senior Re
search Scientist Dave Touretzky,
attempting to contact Murphy on 
the FCCA situation, said, To the 
best of my knowledge, FCCA has 
never acted discourteously toward 
anyone while carrying out its ac
tivities. Thats an admirable record 
for a politically controversial group. 
Harassing them just provides them 
with free publicity and increased 
membership. It would be better 
strategy to give them their carrel 
and leave them alone.
The University Center allo
cation process started October 
16, with the distribution of ap
plications. UCAB Member and 
Senate Chair Brenden Mielke 
said, The UCAB met several 
times between then and Novem
ber 13, when the preliminary 
decisions were published. In

Senate offers advisors to student activities
By JENNY GARCIA 
de OSUNA
Tartan Assistant Forum Editor
In an effort to create closer ties 
between Student Government 
and school organizations, Stu
dent Senate is currently appoint
ing organization advisors to vari
ous student activities. These new 
positions, however, have raised 
some controversy among the or
ganizations, since the groups 
have not all been informed of 
what the duties of their respec
tive advisors actually are.
My immediate reaction to this 
is negative. [ScotchN Soda] does 
some specialized activities, and I 
am not sure that any Senate ad
visor would have the kind of 
knowledge of what we do that 
might make having one worth 
while, said Wendy Jones, presi
dent of Scotch N Soda.
When asked about the objec
tive of the new position, Brenden 
Mielke, Student Senate chair, 
explained that the positions were 
created so that the organizations 
on campus could better utilize
the resources in Student Govern
ment as well as bring the two 
communities together.
Mielke said the title organiza
tion advisors is a working title ... 
because were still not sure exactly 
what the role will be. As of right 
now, the advisors are expected to 
work.with their respective organi
zations on four specific points  
publicity, programming, recruit
ment, and _________
fiscal man
agement. 
not on the 
governing of 
the organi
zations.
Student ~
Government has
strengths in information coordi
nation, and we felt that if we 
offered it to organizations, we 
could see an improvement in both 
the quality of programs and also 
participation rate, said Mielke. 
They [organization advisors] are 
to be support services offered by 
Student Government, not people 
to approve what is going on.
STUDENT
SENATE
The advisors need to make clear 
what they are there to do, said 
David Hackney, general manager 
of WRCT. If [the advisor] could be 
a spokesperson for WRCT on Sen
ate and let us know what is going 
on over there, then I have abso
lutely no problem with it.
To become an organization ad
visor, a Senator or a Senator-atlarge must simply volunteer for 
______a group.
They are 
then briefed 
on basic pro
gramming 
and recruit
ment tech______niques.
As mem
bers of the 
Senate, they ideally know fiscal 
policy well. They choose their pro
spective organization... and if the 
group is positive, we proceed. The 
[organization advisors] are really 
learning as they go, continuously 
evaluating what works and what 
doesnt with the groups, said 
Mielke.
However, some groups seem to
question the effectiveness of such 
a method. I do not think that I 
would want to be assigned to an 
organization that I didnt belong 
to or knew nothing of, said Jones.
Yet, much ofthe controversy lies 
in that the position is new and 
many of the organizations have 
not received all ofthe information.
We are still working out the 
bugs in the program, said 
Mielke. When we are reason
ably confident that we know how 
things will work, we will do a 
more formal roll out.
Mielke explained that the role of 
the Student Senate is to provide 
ideas and be available to help coor
dinate changes if an organization 
so wishes. Through the organiza
tion advisors, the role of the Sen
ate could possibly enhance its ser
vices to the school. However, some 
organizations feel differently.
I would prefer that as long as 
the clubs are not having financial 
difficulties, the Senate should let 
the clubs operate on their own, 
said Kris-Noel Dahl, president of 
Circle K club. Dont try to fix a 
problem that is not there.

Motown record roars back to Detroit, Mich.
DETROIT March 16 (AP)  
Motowns returning to the Motor 
City. Twenty-four years after jilt
ing Detroit and moving to Los An geles, the music company that once 
transformed artists from the citys 
housing projects into superstars is 
coming home. New Motown Presi
dent Andre Harrell announced on 
Friday that Detroit will serve as
the companys ___________________
Midwest 
headquarters 
for Artists &
Repertoire, a 
division of 
Motown that 
signs new art
ists. I realize 
now Detroit is 
very vital to 
the rebirth of
Motown, said Harrell, who said 
his decision was strengthened by a 
visit to the Motown Historical Mu
seum. Its very important for me to 
come back to Detroit. This is a cul
tural treasure. The satellite office 
will open by years end. It will em
ploy a small staff at first, but could 
expand in the future, Harrell said. 
The announcement was music to 
the ears of Jack Brokensha, a ses
sion musician who performed on many 
60s-era hits.
Harrell said he wants to focus on an 
earthy, upbeat sound like that of Detroit 
native Tony Rich, whose Nobody 
Knows is at No. 2 this week on 
Billboards Hot 100. And he said he 
wants to recapture the high- class image 
Motown had in its heyday under the 
direction of founder Berry Gordy. What
_______________________ Berry did was
showcase tal
ent at the high
est level, he 
said.  I have to 
make Motown 
appeal to a 
broad audi
ence.
Gordy moved 
the Motown 
Record Co. to 
Los Angeles in 1972 and sold it to Boston 
Ventures for $60 million in 1988. It was 
sold again to Holland-based PolyGram in 
1993. About 40 percent of the labels $105 
million in earnings last year came from 
its catalog, which includes material from 
legends such as Stevie Wonder, Marvin 
Gaye, and Diana Ross & the Supremes. 
But since Harrell was appointed in Octo
ber, many have said the company is ready 
for a comeback.
I realize now Detroit is 
very vital to the rebirth 
of Motown.

U.S. denounces winner of journalism award
MADRID, Spain March 16 (AP)
 Despite U.S. opposition, Spain 
plans to give its top journalism 
prize to a newspaper report on 
claims that Latin American chil
dren were being killed for organ 
transplants in the United States 
and Europe. King Juan Carlos is to 
award the prize Monday to Brazils 
Correio Brasilense newspaper for 
its 1995 story on alleged traffick
ing in the organs of murdered chil
dren. tJ.S. officials said the allega
tion is untrue, and have been re
peatedly debunked since it began 
circulating in 1987. And the Span
ish government was given mate
rial disproving the story, including 
a United Nations report. It is dif
ficult to understand how the gov
ernment of a modern, Western 
country with adequate experts at 
its disposal decided to become as
sociated with this series of articles, 
which contain false information, 
Brian Carlson, a diplomat at the 
U.S. embassy in Madrid, said Sat
urday. He said the United States 
has complained to the Spanish gov
ernment and foreign ministry about the 
award since it was announced in Decem
ber. But the Foreign Ministry, which co
sponsors the annual King of Spain In
ternational Journalism Prize along with 
the state news agency Efe, said it could 
not interfere with the choice of the fivemember, five-country jury. U.S. officials 
fear the allegations put Americans in 
danger. In 1994, the State Department 
warned tourists away from Guatemala, 
after organ transplant rumors inspired 
mob attacks on American women. In 
March, 300 people in the town of San 
Cristobal stabbed and beat an Alaskan 
woman they accused of stealing a local 
boy. The boy later returned home safe 
from a religious procession he had been 
watching.
Weeks earlier, residents of Santa Lucia 
Otzumalguapa burned down the police 
station after officers released a New 
Mexico woman falsely accused of steal
ing children. The Guatemala City 
archbishops office concluded that the 
rumors and subsequent attacks were in
stigated by the army, which has been 
accused of serious human rights viola
tions for decades.
Russia votes for 
Soviet Union
MOSCOW March 15 (AP)Russias 
parliament voted overwhelmingly Fri
day that the breakup of the Soviet Union 
in 1991 was illegal and demanded that 
concrete steps be taken to restore it. 
President Boris Yeltsin has said he 
would block the Communist-backed 
move, and critics said it would have 
little immediate effect.
But it heightens election-year tensions 
in Moscow, and is likely to cause alarm in 
many of the 14 other former Soviet re
publics. This is a serious signal that can 
turn into a funeral march on June 16, 
the day of Russias presidential elections, 
said Alexander Shokhin of the pro-govemment Our Home is Russia faction. 
The Communists... have demonstrated 
that they can pass any resolution, and 
they showed what is going to happen 
when they come to full power.
The motion received heavy support 
from nationalists and others, as well as 
Communists, passing 250-98 with no 
abstentions. The Soviet Union broke up 
into 15 independent countries in 1991 
after many of the republics declared 
independence.
Twelve of the states later joined the 
Commonwealth of Independent States, 
a weak consultative body. Most of the 
former republics are fiercely indepen
dent and would oppose any move to 
restore Moscows hegemony. Commu
nist lawmaker Anatoly Lukyanov, 
chairman of the old Supreme Soviet 
and a plotter of the 1991 coup against 
Mikhail Gorbachev, hailed the vote as 
a major moral and political move that 
the people were expecting.
The Communist Party has surged in 
popularity in recent years, capitalizing 
on many Russians anger over the disin
tegration of the Soviet Union and the loss 
of superpower status, along with eco
nomic hardships. Yeltsin, who is seeking 
a second term, told,a meeting of mayors 
earlier in the day that the Communist 
resolution was a pre-election ploy.
A key figure in the signing of the 1991 
agreements dissolving the Soviet Union, 
Yeltsin told Russian Television that he, 
too, was deeply saddened when the 
country where he was bom ceased to 
exist. But he denied Communist allega
tions that he was responsible. One 
man could not destroy the Soviet Union 
in a few months. This is not possible, 
he said. The process was inevitable.
Yeltsin pointed to efforts by some of 
the republics to form closer economic 
ties and move toward greater integra
tion. This is of course an unpleasant 
story for the Communists, Yeltsin said.
Speaking out against the resolution 
were leaders of Our Home is Russia, 
the Yabloko bloc of Grigory Yavlinsky, 
and prominent independents such as 
retired Gen. Alexander Lebed and eye 
surgeon Syatoslav Fyodorov. The Com
munist resolution appeared timed to
coincide with the fifth anniversary of a 
March 17,1991, Soviet referendum on 
preserving the Union.
Hard core drug use remains big
WASHINGTON March 15 (AP)  
Use of cocaine and crack in the United 
States appears to be stabilizing, but 
heroin is becoming more readily avail
able, the White House drug policy chief 
said Friday.
I think theres room for optimism, 
retired General Barry R. McCaffrey said 
at his first news conference since being 
sworn in last week as the new national 
drug control policy director. Releasing a 
quarterly study of U.S. drug use, 
McCaffrey cited some recent favorable 
trends and significant long-term devel
opments since the 1970s as reasons for 
his optimism. But he said overall drug 
abuse remains too high and is damag
ing the quality of American life.
The quarterly pulse check study, 
based on interviews with drug research
ers, law officers, and drug treatment 
workers, said, The use of both cocaine 
and crack has stabilized in most areas. 
McCaffrey said the number of cocaine 
users appears to have dropped about 30 
percent over the past three years. The 
message is getting through that this is 
a threat to your life, he said.
Scotland mourns 
over massacre
DUNBLANE, Scotland March 15 
(AP) All of Dunblane has been re
duced to silent processions and numb 
conversation, beside the banks of flow
ers, outside the post office, inside the 
laundromat, at the 13th-century ca
thedral that is the towns main land
mark and the focus of its grief.
Most villagers have taken their turn 
walking or driving up the slope of Doune 
Road, its signposts warning criminals of 
a neighborhood watch program, its 
wooded lanes and stone mansions life
less with hidden mourning. Cheeks and 
eyes often red from tears, they stare at 
the bullet-pocked school where 
Dunblanes idyllic image met its bloody 
end. Why? One says, God bless this 
sad little town.
I cant believe it. I live next door to a 
massacre, says Henry Dobbin, a 
Dunblane resident since 1926, leaning 
on his cane as he surveys the scene 
outside his front door.
Tom Hamiltons last act of madness 
did more than murder 16 kindergartners and their teacher before taking his 
own life. Hamiltons bullets marked the 
map of Dunblane like a shotgun blast, 
bringing grief to a home on almost every 
street and confronting its 9,000-odd resi
dents with a loss beyond explanation.
This is a big family town. The victims 
were neighbors of a huge number of
people. In that sense the wider spread of 
victims is hard to imagine, says Philip 
Gregory, who has lived in this prosper
ous village for 35 years.
Some see the attack as a consequence of 
a society made brutal and callous by me
dia violence. The children of today need 
support, and they face indifference, now 
blind hatred, says Dawn Smith, 23, j 
nursery school assistant who had cared 
for five of the dead children. Others cast 
the killings in apocalyptic terms.
This could happen anywhere you live, 
says Alison Downie, who had returned 
to her childhood town just last month 
because of all the good memories.
I believe in God and the Bible, and 
where it says the end of the world is nigh, 
If you read your Book of Revelation, what 
happened here starts to make sense, she 
said.
Before Wednesdays massacre, 
Downie says, the worst thing that ever 
happened in Dunblane was a car breaks 
in. Now it is the scene of Britains worst 
mass murder in modem history, made 
all the more reprehensible by the youth 
of its victims.
Florida bar may 
suspend lawyer
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. March 15 (AP)
 F. Lee Bailey, imprisoned in a dis
pute over $25 million in stock from ; 
former client, now has another fight on 
his hands: The Florida Bar is trying to 
suspend him from practicing law.
The famed defense lawyer was given 
until Friday to respond to the bars 
petition to the state Supreme Court. 
Bailey, whose practice is based in West 
Palm Beach, has been imprisoned since 
March 7 on a six-month contempt sen
tence for failing to hand over the stock 
he was keeping for a drug-dealer cli
ent.
The bar said Thursday that its own 
investigation showed Bailey deliberately 
impeded a judges order to surrender the 
stock.
The suspension would prohibit Bailey 
from practicing law for a specified pe
riod. It was not immediately clear how 
long the bar wanted the suspension to 
last.
Bailey was imprisoned after he missed 
a deadline to raise $2.3 milhon needed to 
pay off a lien that would allow a bank to 
release the disputed stock.
Friends and relatives have said they 
are trying to raise the money needed for 
his release.
Bailey, whose clients have included 
O.J. Simpson, Patty Hearst, and Dr. 
Sam Sheppard, contends he is entitled 
to keep the stock to cover fees and ex
penses for representing former client 
Claude Duboc.
Duboc is awaiting sentencing. Assis
tant U.S. Attorney David McGee argues 
the money was entrusted to Bailey to 
use in administering some of Dubocs 
property and must be returned.

for the most spectacular of Beaux 
Arts Balls. The Maurice Spitalny 
orchestra was scheduled to pro

in the College of Fine Arts. The

The society planned on trans

Tickets were $3.60 per person,

large-scale student-owned-andoperated housing project built by 
the Carnegie-Mellon Student 
Government Corporation. The 
project was envisioned as offer
ing a variety of housing options 
similar to off-campus apartments 
at a cost similar to or lower than
University Housing. The commit
tee planned on having students 
operate and maintain the hous
ing.
The committee hoped to have 
students managing and operat

By SAVIT TEWARI
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
This semester, Residence 
Life hired four second-semester freshmen as Resident As
sistants (RAs). This transition 
included replacing upperclass 
RAs in Welch and Mudge with 
freshmen.
We take particular care 
in selecting and placing 
first-year students. It is fg 
not right for all first-year 
students, but there are 
definitely some who pos
sess the skills and talents 
necessary to succeed in this 
role, said John Hannon, 
the assistant director of 
Residence Life. We select the 
most qualified people for the 
positions.
There are many reasons why 
a freshman would want to be 
an RA so early on. For Holly 
Gabrielson, an RA in Welch 
and an H&SS freshman, the 
main reason was, to get in
volved with things on campus 
and to have some influence on 
the University environment. 
Shes found the job challeng
ing but hasnt run into any 
problems that she couldnt 
handle. I havent had a prob
lem with authority or respect 
from the residents here, she 
said.
Sophia Zuberi, a sophomore 
IM major living in Welch, said 
that, [Gabrielson] is doing a 
good job. Many of Gabrielsons
residents shared similar opin
ions.
Julie Obloy, an RA in Mudge 
and a CIT freshman, said her 
reasons for becoming an RA were 
similar to Gabrielsons. I wanted 
to meet people, and this was a 
good way. I think I am a good role 
model, she said.
One of her Mudge residents

Residence Life
9dnddas0i6MUyriner 8rryh Roh 
said, She [Obloy] is much more 
in touch with [the residents on] 
the floor than the previous RA. 
Another said, She has the an
swers to the questions we need.
For example, she had the neces
sary information about the room 
selection process that we went 
through recently.
John Hannon said, Some RAs 
are unable to return to staff in 
the Spring semester. This is due 
to either academic difficulties 
or study abroad opportunities.
It is rare that we have had to 
terminate an RA for failure to 
complete job-related responsi
bilities. This year, no RAs lost 
their job due to poor perfor
mance. There is, however, an
other possible reason for quit
ting midway through the year, 
as Mike Leonard, a senior math
major and an experienced RA 
at Doherty Apartments, said, 
the RAs may lose interest in 
the job after a couple of years, 
which may force them to quit. 
A new RA is full of energy and 
likes this place. They are ac
tive, eager to help, and eager 
to do things.
Residence Life would not ac
cept people who they felt 
were not qualified, 
Leonard said. It becomes 
the responsibility of the RA 
to adjust and do well. It 
can be a good thing to be
come a second semester RA 
on the floor where they 
were living in the first se
mester since they already 
know the people on the floor. 
Some upperclassmen ex
pressed surprise at the sugges
tion of a freshman RA. How
ever, as a resident at Welch 
said, I did not know initially 
that Julie was a freshman. 
When I found out, I first thought 
it was kind of weird, but she is 
doing a fine job.
John Hannon said, There are 
79 RA positions. Typically, about 
35 percent of the staff are sopho
mores, 35 percent juniors, and 
30 percent seniors... Since we 
are confident thatthere are some 
first-year students at CMU who 
would make good RAs, we do not 
exclude them from the applica
tion process. In the end we select 
the most qualified people for the 
positions withoutregardto class 
year.

Everythings going to con
tinue. Mehrabian said. We may 
even have to accelerate.
Michael Murphy, Dean of Stu
dent Affairs, has worked closely 
with Mehrabian over the years. 
He has been great to work with. 
He is a hard-charger, but also 
team-oriented, Murphy said. 
One of his most important quali
ties is his compassion. This is 
especially true in working with 
students, where he has always 
been very actively involved when
ever there was a special need or 
crisis.
In fact, Mehrabian has estab
lished a relationship with stu
dents even outside of crisis situa
tions. I used to play soccer with 
the teams until I tore the liga
ments in my knee, he recalled.
Students expressed surprise at 
Mehrabians announcement, as 
well as criticism for his relation
ship with students. There hadnt 
been any rumors beforehand, 
said Brian Fredrickson, a sopho
more in CIT.
Fredrickson also expressed 
hope for Mehrabians replace
ment. I never see Mehrabian, 
he said. Maybe well get a presi
dent that well actually see 
around. I think Ive seen him once 
[and] that was at a speech last 
year at Orientation.
Other students expressed simi
lar sentiments. How can I miss 
someone Ive never seen? asked 
Benjamin Roberts, a freshman 
undeclared in H&SS.
He doesnt have that much
contact with the students, and 
thats disappointing in a presi
dent, said Kara Weeks, a senior 
drama major. Weeks said that 
she was surprised at the an
nouncement, especially since he 
signed a contract four months 
ago.
Under President Mehrabians 
leadership, Carnegie Mellon 
has remained among the 
nations top 25 highest ranked 
universities. Applications for
the freshman class have hit an 
all-time high. The University 
endowment has grown by al
most $200 million. Construc
tion to renovate the campus in
cluding the University Center 
and the new fine arts center 
has been implemented. Re
search (up 7.5 percent this year) 
has also continued to grow.
This is a great school, 
Mehrabian said. Im going to be 
really sorry to go.

Dean denies space allocation
uMMhbugshct m;R8 iedD 6
late November the UCAB held ses
sions to allow organizations to contest 
the results. A week later the UCAB 
sent its recommendations to Murphy. 
He returned it to us on February 15. 
He .notified organizations shortly 
thereafter, Mielke said.
Both Mielke and Murphy gave favor
able impressions of the UCAB. The 
UCAB performed very well, we had many 
variables to deal with. The UCABs 
recommendations were definitely re
spected by Dean Murphy. He ques
tioned us on several allocations and ac
cepted our answers, Mielke said. Dean 
Murphy listened to us and our reason
ings. We appreciate that.
I think the students on the UCAB did 
a good job in reaching consensus about 
the allocation of space.... One of the 
critical issues they needed to address 
was matching up organizations to share 
office space, Murphy said. Mielke ex
plained that the UCAB paired organi
zations that had worked well in the past 
and others that seemed to fit.
Mielke and Murphy said that the 
UCABs diversity contributed to much
of their success. It consisted of members 
from the activities UCAB, Graduate Stu
dent Organization, Student Dormitory 
Council, Greek Council, and three from 
Senate.
Most organizations are disappointed 
with their allocation space. Mielke 
said, everybody is [unsatisfied] ex
cept The Tartan. Mielkes own group, 
Senate, has a small room similar to its 
current location in the student center. 
The problem is the rooms arent large 
enough to be actual meeting places, 
Mielke said.
A major issue of the allocation pro
cess was that not every organization 
that wanted space received it. The 
UCAB denied space to Sigma Phi Ep
silon and the Computer Club. We 
spoke with each organization  the 
space available would not have met 
their needs in our mutual opinions, 
.Mielke said. Neither organization was 
available for comment.
The UCAB will convene again this fall 
to make minor changes, settle storage 
issues, and field new applications. Ev
ery three years, all space in the Univer
sity Center will be reevaluated.
Student Government appoints VP to office
f.t m;R8 iedD 6
time is being spent in meetings which 
prevents her from being more active 
in student affairs.
With a vice president, Schuyler 
says that she would have a repre
sentative to attend some of her many 
meetings.
The vice president position would 
allow me to become 
more active in my 
original platform in 
running for office, 
which stressed aca
demic service, stu
dent pride, and ser
vice, Schuyler said.
There has also 
been concern about 
Munozs affiliations. In addition to 
being the new vice president of stu
dent government, she is also the 
Panhellenic Council president. Ques
tions about whether there would be 
a conflict of interest from her hold
ing both positions have been raised, 
due to student government control 
of appropriations of students activi
ties fees.
When asked about a conflict of inter
est between offices, Munoz said, Im 
in the executive branch of the student 
government. The legislative branch 
controls where the money goes. I have 
nothing to do with the allocation deci
sions, so I dont see how there could be 
a conflict of interest.
In asking students on campus about
When student government involves more 
people, it will be able to represent a wider 
cross-section of the CMU population. 
 Bryon Krug; Academic Affairs Chairman
their opinions on the new vice presi
dent, the majority of students re
sponded that they do not know much 
about student government.
Mitch Kotula, a senior mechanical en
gineering major, said, Once a friend 
just asked me to vote for someone who 
was running for office.
Schuyler admits that student partici
pation and voter turnout for student
government is low, but says that the 
Senate public relations committee is 
working hard to increase participation.
Krug points to email polls that were 
randomly sent to students. He said, 
To address the problem of student 
government not always being an accu
rate voice of the student body, the 
academic affairs committee sent an 
email poll to fresh
man, sophomores, 
and juniors on cam
pus to get student 
opinion on five dif
ferent questions 
that the committee 
hoped to address.
...........  i This way the committee and senate 
could base its course of action on stu
dent opinion rather than on its own 
opinions.
To increase participation, students 
have been invited to voice their opin
ions on the new vice president and any 
other concerns during regular Student 
Senate meetings which are held every 
Tuesday at 5:00 PM in Adamson Wing, 
Baker Hall.
Crime and Incident Report
3/7 SMOKING VIOLATION,
2:10 am. An officer was on patrol 
in one of the academic buildings 
when he came upon a student 
who was smoking a cigarette. The 
student tried to put the cigarette 
out before the officer saw him. 
The officer asked the student for 
his Carnegie Mellon ID, but the 
student responded with, an ID 
is only a state of mind.
The student then gave the of
ficer a very hard time about smok
ing in the building saying that he 
pays $19,000 to be able to smoke 
in the building.
The officer issued the student 
an internal citation for refusing 
to produce his CMU ID when 
requested to do so by a security 
officer and for violation of the 
CMU smoking policy.
3/9 ASSAULT, 3:38 am. A stu
dent was visiting a fraternity with 
some friends when two of the 
brothers in the house approached
him because he was an inactive 
member and owed the fraternity 
money. The victim stated that he 
would not leave the house until 
his girlfriend left.
According to the victim, one 
of the brothers punched him 
below the left eye. At this point, 
friends of each began throwing 
punches. The confrontation 
ended when the victim went up
stairs to speak with other broth
ers in the house. The incident 
will be turned over to Residence 
Life for further review.
3/14 SUSPECTED SHOP
LIFTING, 12:49 pm. A manager 
at one of the dining halls called 
Campus Police stating that she 
was detaining two males who 
were possibly tryingto steal some
thing. One of the students had 
exited through the entrance while 
he was carrying a small tube of 
lip medication (cost $1.89). He 
told police that he had forgotten
that he had the item in his hand. 
The students paid for the item 
and said they were sorry.
The Tartan prints the weekly 
Crime and Incident Report under 
the following guidelines:
Campus Police Chief James 
LaPaglia reviews all reports prior

Senate advisor program 
fails to meet goal
Student Government is making 
an effort to improve its effectiveness 
and image on campus. A new, more 
energetic, focused, and active Sen
ate has taken office in the last se
mester and has been considering 
various ways to make an impact 
and improve the quality of life for 
the University Committee.
To that extent, the Senate Execu
tive Committee (Ex-Comm) last 
week enacted the organization ad
visor program, in an effort to im
prove communication among activi
ties and to assist organizations on 
several levels of management.
Unfortunately, the method by 
which the program was imple
mented undermined its very objec
tives  communication was para
mount to the programs launch, and 
was apparently overlooked.
To illustrate, the fundamentals of 
the program were simply not com
municated to the organizations. For 
instance, the role of the advisor was 
poorly described and left essentially 
undefined. Would the advisor have 
final say in an organizations bud
get? Would the advisor be entitled 
to sit in on all meetings?
In addition, opinions on logistics 
and policies regarding these advi
sors and their potential responsi
bilities were not solicited from the 
organizations.
Aside from having questionable 
responsibilities, once selected, the 
advisors turned out to have ques
tionable qualifications at best. Many 
of these advisors seem to have little 
business as advisors to organiza
tions; the only required qualifica
tion necessary to become an advisor 
for any given organization is to vol
unteer to do it.
Any Senator would actually be 
more than happy to explain to any
one that the advisors are not, in 
fact, being forced on the organiza
tionsthey are completely optional, 
and any organization may reject its 
assigned advisor. This clause makes 
Senates intentions seem much less 
power-driven and far more helpful. 
Still, the lack of communication from 
Senate to the organizations kept 
this information unknown, prompt
ing some organizations to overreact 
unnecessarily. The very fact that no 
one knew that the advisors are op
tional illustrates how ineffective 
Student Senates efforts at commu
nication have been.
Senates driving logic behind the 
program is that a third-party, Sen
ate advisor will help make up for the 
high leadership-tumover rate in stu
dent organizations. As organization 
leaders move on, supposedly the ad
visor will be around to help the new 
leaders in the transition period.
However, Student Senators only 
serve one year terms, so there is no 
reason to believe that an advisor 
will be around any longer than those 
to be advised. In fact, many of the 
larger organizations maintain lead
ership for years and promote suc
cession from within their own ranks, 
so that new leaders already have a 
handle on how to run things.
Student Senate should not con
sider itself a total authority with 
the ability to save campus leaders 
from the loads of paper work that is 
merely the fault of Senate to begin 
with.
Another fold to Senates web of 
logic is that new organizations need 
help getting started. An imminent 
flaw in this philosophy is that if 
these groups need help getting 
started, it is probably because Stu
dent Senate policy has made it ex
ceedingly complicated. Instead of 
assigning someone to explain 
Senates rules to the organizations,
perhaps Senate should cut some 
of their own red-tape, and elimi
nate the need for explanation.
While it is true that some orga
nizations may need occasional as
sistance in managing the organi
zation, as in tailoring an annual 
budget, this need should be more 
than fulfilled by a simple visit to 
the Student government office to 
ask a question.
If this is a structure that does 
not work, two bothersome reasons 
may be cited: (1) Student Senates 
structure makes them unap
proachable or ineffective, or (2) 
the organization leader in ques
tion may not be an appropriate 
leader for that group. The trick is 
finding a solution that works for 
everyone.
Our Student Senate wants to 
help, so kudos to them. But if the 
Senators really want to change 
their image for the better and be
come an effective legislature for 
the students, they would be better 
with more doing and less help
ing.
While the philosophy of the ad
visors program has its merits, its 
efforts are misdirected in the con
text of helping the students. Orga
nizations are not the problem, 
they are instead part of the solu
tion, and the Senate must realize 
this, and to this extent, they should 
not be the focus of the Ex-Comms 
and Senates efforts.
In truth, the latest endeavor, 
the advisors program, indicates a 
greater illness within the Student 
Government. Instead of becoming 
a body of active and highly-visible 
and positive leaders, the Student 
Senate is simply becoming a bal
looning bureaucracy.
As opposed to just being Sena
tors who do nothing, and commit
tee members who do nothing, as 
they have been in the past, now it 
seems that Senators can be advi
sors who do nothing.
Before these advisors start to 
tell other organizations how to get 
on the ball, perhaps Senate should 
set an example. Hopefully, the new 
Student Body Vice President will 
help keep committees on track, 
but the very fact that Student gov
ernment felt the need for a Vice 
President to monitor Senate com
mittees shows just how stagnant 
the organization has become.
If Senate wants to improve com
munication with the student or
ganizations, perhaps those orga
nizations can send representatives 
to Student Senate meetings in
stead of Senate sending represen
tatives to the organizations. As 
such, when issues are raised, those 
representatives can inform Sen
ate and ask for advice when neces
sary.
Senators also need to make 
themselves more visible to their 
constituents. Office hours need to 
be held and advertised. Senators 
have to remember that they are 
elected to represent all of the stu
dents in their college, not just work 
with student organizations.
In general the role of Student 
Senate is, at best, not apparent to 
their constituents. Their recently 
adopted Vision Statement, which 
refers to efforts to improve its role 
as a proactive leader on campus, is 
a very admirable direction for the 
Student Government to take.
However, the Student Senate 
must now embrace that direction 
and push hard to succeed in their 
vision. In turn, Senators must curb 
and discontinue its bureaucratic 
tendencies to concentrate on that
Letters to the Editor
Reader protests 
use of pictures
Editor:
I was pleased to see 
the Tartan place cov
erage of CMUs cel
ebrations of Womens 
History Month on the 
front page of the Liv
ing section.
As I read about life for women at 
CMU, however, I found that the accomLetter to 
the Editor
panying drawings bore no relationship 
to the substance of the article.
I was reading about women studying 
engineering, receiving teaching awards, 
critiquing images of women in the me
dia, and taking self-defense classes. But 
I was looking at sketches of Barbieesque women, naked, with flowing hair 
and disproportionately long legs posing, 
or crouched in fetal position.
The article, taken with its illustra
tions, sends me a mixed message: Women 
are welcome at CMU to work, study, 
play sports, do research, and contribute 
to campus life, but we will continue to be
held up against unrealistic, sex-based, 
media-driven stereotypes.
The phrase men at CMU evokes an 
image in my mind of hardworking stu
dents in engineering or drama classes, 
reading in the library or hanging out on 
the Cut.
It bothers me that the phrase women 
at CMU apparently evoked a very dif
ferent image over at The Tartan.

Evolution, my 
butt. Darwin was 
full of it. Plain and 
simple. Come on. 
One guy comes up 
with an idea about
Douglas Howe ^e frmation of 
life and were all
supposed to
blindly jump on the bandwagon? There was one trial about 
100 years ago, and magically, it becomes the predominant 
law of life? Well, hogwash. I say prove it. And no matter what 
youd say, Id respond, That isnt good enough. And Id say 
that because science is just a bunch of bull. The reason I dont 
buy evolution is because I dont think weve gotten any
where. But what is science really? A bunch of laws and 
theories that were set up to make people feel comfortable 
that we have a clue about whats going on in the universe. 
Well, we dont. Live with it. There 
was a time when everybody thought 
the world was flat and that leeches 
would be a really good way of help
ing people get better. Up until a few 
years ago we thought the atom was 
the smallest piece of matter there 
was, then, whoops, we broke it open, 
and we were wrong. But thats all 
chalked up to science. Well, we were 
wrong, but were not wrong about 
anything else. Science is fact. Sci
ence is the truth. No room for inter
pretation. No room for adjustment.
Well, its just a guess. Not even re
ally an educated one either. Just a 
guess, like the rest of life.
Same with the government. Were 
supposed to accept the fact that the
laws and regulations they set up are the best ones. Why? 
Because somebody thought itd be a good idea and, hell, we 
were involved, right? We elected them. We trust them. No 
point in questioning authority. They are better prepared to 
deal with these kinds of things than we are. Because their 
families are rich and bought Harvard a gym, their little boy 
could be a Congressman? The Baby Boomer Generation 
wants to call us lazy and disrespectful and irresponsible. 
That we were raised soft and weak, with no guts. That 
somebody should have put the fear of God into us, and then 
wed straighten out. Well, give me something to respect, and 
I will. Show responsibility to our democratic way of life, our 
tax-supported institutions. What about to the individual 
human animal? Ours is a government of laws, not people. 
Maybe thats the problem. Respect and obey authority, 
blindly, because thats the only way we can go on living in a 
democratic society. I read somewhere once a perfect re
sponse to all this and I strong believe it. The only authority 
I respect is the one that causes butterflies to fly south in fall 
and north in springtime. Do I mean God? Not necessarilly. 
But I think so.
How can you say that? This is America. Where freedom 
reigns. If I had to, Id risk my life for this country. Thats how
strongly I believe in this system. Well, what else would you 
risk? Disapproval? Economic security? A belief? Nothing is 
courageous in risking ones life, unless youre risking some
thing with it. Real courage is risking something you have to 
keep on living with, real courage is risking something that 
might force you to rethink your thoughts and suffer change 
and stretch consciousness. Real courage is risking ones clichs.
Eric Bogosian wrote that the only things worth doing were 
making love or art, because thats when you know youre real 
and making a connection. If the government or science were 
looked upon as they should be, as an art form, a work in 
progress, then maybe wed get somewhere. When the space 
program began, it wasnt out of curiosity or exploration, it was 
out of fear. The Russians had sent up a satellite into space, and 
prominently displayed it so we all could see and know that they 
were more advanced than us. So the Americans put the best 
minds in physics and the like together (who were almost all 
Germans who had formerly worked for the Nazis, just so you
knew it wasnt even 
us Americans who 
actually did it) and 
made us go to the 
moon. Lets get 
those damn Rus
sians. Well show 
them whos in 
charge. Its nice to 
know that our inspi
ration for getting to 
the moon was spite, 
not love. But what if 
it was? Galileo 
wasnt in it for ap
proval. Imagine 
what people thought
_ of him when he said 9aU2 9nUlaestaUyae 8Uy gyavv 7 wM 7 PM C
it because he knew it wasnt the answer, but the idea. He had: 
the courage and the belief to risk ridicule and disapproval. 
Einstein would probably be considered one of the smartest 
men we know in the 20th century, but even he said we could 
never understand it all. He sure didnt. He was an atheist.
Our problem is that we live in a goal-oriented society. We 
dont search for meaning or purpose, we search for the answer, 
but the answer isnt out there. Its in here. Tom Robbins told 
this story:
When she was a small girl, Amanda hid a ticking clock in an 
old rotten tree trunk. It drove woodpeckers crazy. Ignoring tasty 
bugs all around them, they just about beat their brains out: 
trying to get at the clock. Years later, Amanda used the 
woodpecker experiment as a model for understanding capital
ism, Communism, modern Christianity and all other systems 
that traffic in future rewards rather than in present realities.
Shut up, you weirdo commie bastard. Im an American and 
damn proud of it. Well, Im a human being and prepared to 
face the consequences.

Pittsburgh native discusses local quirks
Jason Togyer
The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania 
just paid an advertising agency $3.4 
million to develop a new state slogan. 
After six months, the best they could 
come up with was Pennsylvania Memo
ries Last a Lifetime.
Feh. Ill admit that its better than 
America Starts Here and Youve Got 
a Friend in Pennsylvania, but it doesnt 
exactly rival Just Do It. Not to mention 
the fact that if you have Pennsylvania 
Memories, youve already left, which 
isnt the sort of thing we should be en
couraging, given the states declining 
population.
The main error comes in the continu
ing effort to market the state as a ho
mogenous body. Nonsense. Pittsburgh 
is a bizarre place that resists all at
tempts to join the crowd. As one wag put 
it, When the apocalypse comes, I want 
to be in Pittsburgh, because itll get here 
10 years late.
My best friend moved from Pittsburgh 
last year to central Pennsylvania so that 
he could go to Penn State. Every time he 
comes back, he says the same thing: 
This whole town is nuts.
At first, I tried to argue with him, but 
lately, Ive begun to think he might have 
a point. The clincher came the other day, 
as I rode our three-hole miniature sub
way from Wood Street to Station Square.
In front of me was a young couple that 
was telling the man next to them about 
the evening they had planned: dinner at 
the Grand Concourse, then a night at 
the symphony.
He had on what looked to be a $4 
suit, a crew-cut, and was chewing gum. 
She had on an equally expensive blouse* 
stretch pants, and enough hairspray to, 
make an entire cornfield stand straight, 
up.
I got off of the subway and walked, 
through Station Square, where I passed 
three people wearing T-shirts that said, 
Irish I Had Another Beer (ha, ha, get. 
it?) and one guy wearing camouflage, 
from head to toe (I guess he thought he.- 
was blending into the frozen yogurt, 
stand).

Over-diversity undermines nationBurgh amuses
bL.mgf vUnS HalM ,
Later that day, I listened to a speech by a promi
nent member of the business community, who had 
combed his hair so far over his bald spot, the part 
started somewhere below his earlobe.
No wonder were lagging behind Ohio in attract
ing new business, industry, and residents. In the 
words of the immortal Fat Albert, were like school 
in the summertime  no class.
But its not just our peculiar grooming habits that 
make us weird. Take driving. I dread coming to an 
intersection in Pittsburgh. If someone else has the 
right-of-way and I come to a stop, chances are the 
other person will sit there for three minutes smiling 
and trying to wave me through. On the other hand, 
if I have the right of way, a pedestrian will step off 
of the curb in front of me. People jaywalk every
where, but only in Pittsburgh has it become a 
participatory sport.
Green lights, corners, walk/dont walk signs, and 
crosswalks mean nothing to the average 
Pittsburgher.
Age is not a factor. Ninety-year-old grandmothers 
from Munhall stroll right into the middle of rushPeople jaywalk everywhere, 
but only in Pittsburgh has it 
become a participatory 
sport 
hour traffic to go to the post office.
Sometimes, I wish the front of my car was covered 
with foam rubber so that I didnt have to swerve to 
miss them.
Dont even mention winter weather!
Id swear we were in the tropics the way the entire 
city panics at the first sign of snow. Four thousand 
people converge on Giant Eagle and clear it of 
bread, toilet paper, and milk, then drive home at 
two miles per hour.
Strong men weep at the sight of drivers whore 
halfway up a snow-covered hill, and then, for some 
inexplicable reason, slam on their brakes.
Ive been to other parts of the state where middleaged women dont puff their hair to monumental 
size and shellac it, where men pull their pants up far 
enough to cover their behinds. Our bad habits are as 
indigenous to western Pennsylvania as Clark bars 
and Iron City beer.
The worst part is, as a native, Im as prone as 
anyone else. Last year, I was walking across the Cut 
wearing my Pirates hat, a Carnegie Tech sweatshirt, 
a Kennywood windbreaker, and my pants with the 
paint stains on the knees.
A friend walking the other way said, You are a 
complete yinzerl and I confess, I couldnt argue 
with her.
So why isnt the state promoting our cultural 
peculiarities?
We go to Dutch country to see Amish farmers and 
crafts; whats to say the Amish wouldnt go to 
Bloomfield to see kitchen chairs holding parking 
spaces open?
Im calling on you, gentle reader, to write a tour
ism slogan that focuses on Pittsburgh.
Email it to jt3y+@andrew.cmu.edu by April 4. 
Bonus points if you can fit in the words redd-up, 
jagoff, or any other authentic Pittsburghese.
I cant promise $3.4 million, but Ill put the best 
ones in my column with your name on them, and 
maybe Ill give you a melted Klondike bar or some
thing.
Its my hometown, and I love it, but, boy, is it 
weird.
Jason Togyer is a senior English major whod like 
to. emphasize that, like a million other 
Pittsburghers, hes actually from one of the 129 
other itty-bitty independent municipalities that ring 
the city.
Within the 
last few de
cades, a tide has 
been sweeping 
our nations in^^^^^^Derej^obinson stitutions. Emphasis has
switched from performance to diversity. In executive cor
ners, hiring a diverse force has become more important 
than hiring an effective force. In our schools, a traditional 
Western education has been deferred to a more multi
cultural education. Is this beneficial to our great nation, or 
does it harm our future prosperity? Like all complex 
matters, each facet of the issue must be explored in depth 
to achieve full understanding of what is actually happen
ing.
Affirmative Action was a method of wealth redistribu
tion to combat racial inequality. It was originally formed 
to offset common discriminatory practices in the 1960s. 
Many feel it is no longer needed and is actually reverse 
discrimination. However, these people fail to realize two 
things: Affirmative Action is merely a compromise, not a 
solution. Second, racism is still a powerful force in modernday America. Some are content to forget the problem and 
blame an individual for lacking strong values and a proper 
work ethic. This may sometimes be the case, but even the 
hardest-working minority has a high probability of meet
ing racial resistance. What is the cause of this? Surely, by 
following job quotas, the most qualified applicant will 
sometimes be shafted for the required minority. It seems 
that procedure is suddenly more important than the re
sults. Even with the recognition of the importance of 
Affirmative Action, diversity persists elsewhere.
One of the persistent hot spots for this proliferation is 
within our educational infrastructure. The focus on tradi
tional Western ideas is gradually gathering negative at
tention. For some reason, certain people feel America is 
obligated to present a universal, multi-cultural education 
to anyone and everyone.
But America is part of Western culture, and since we 
belong to Western culture, it is ours to teach.
Sure, Western products derive origins from all around 
the world, but they come together in the West.
For example, Stanford was recently forced to update 
its curriculum by replacing a Western culture course 
with one that was more multi-cultural. Does this mean 
that no other country emphasizes their own culture? 
Why is it only America falls victim to these claims of 
culture-centrism?
Because America is the land of opportunity and the 
land where everyone can claim a piece of their own. Of 
course, by using improper methods, people can always 
get their way. The irony lies in the fact that ideas 
concerning freedom, equality, and rights have origi
nated in the West. But standards have changed, and 
this wealth of information is no longer diverse enough, 
even though its critics claim the West is made up of 
other cultures anyway. Go figure.
But in case I come under attack from such criticism as 
well, I must point out that there is nothing wrong with 
a diverse education. Every culture of the world has 
equally important contributions to make. But it is when 
the value of Western culture is criticized that one must 
raise their voice. Diversity is an important issue, but 
one which tends to assume certain perspectives. America 
is diverse, and cultures/expressions must never be 
denied or repressed. But this goes with mainstream 
culture as well. As long as the predominant culture 
remains fair, just, and open-minded, it has every right 
to be emphasized.
And so we come full circle. America is changing; 
forces are changing it from within. Racism remains a 
problem; Affirmative Action attempts to solve it. Should 
we continue to concentrate on our own culture in 
education, or include a plethora of others? Whatever 
happens, we must never forget the importance of qual
ity, and the value of our own culture. America is free, 
but that does mean it is free to adopt poor and damaging 
standards.

Columnist confronts conservatives
I have frequently been accused of 
being a conservative Republican. I 
should like to clear that up. I am most 
definitely not a conservative. Except
ing a few rare men, most conserva
tives are, if anything, worse than the 
liberals.
Their main problem is that they 
accept the same premises as the liber
als, these premises including that the 
government has a moral right to con
trol and regulate the economy for the 
public good, that the government 
has a moral right to provide for the 
poor at the expense of those who pro
duce, that the government should pro
scribe morality in some form; in short, 
that some men have the right to con
trol and sacrifice the lives of other 
men. Yet they posture as the defend
ers of freedom and capitalism, all the 
while contradicting themselves in al
most every action. Any justification 
they give for freedom and capitalism 
rests on tradition, faith, and the com
mon good.
The fact that they attempt to exist in 
this state of contradiction leads to an
other problem, which is their general 
lack of principles and a reluctance to 
stand on any they actually possess. 
This is best exemplified in the person 
of Bob Dole, a man who has no prin
ciples and who is willing to compro
mise on just about any value.
Take for example the Republican 
primaries that have taken place over 
the past few weeks. First, there is 
the case of Steve Forbes. While far 
from perfect by my standards, he 
was probably one of the best candi
dates for president to come along in 
literally a century or more. His mes
sage was simple: Freedorti works, 
capitalism works, so lets get the 
hell out of their way. Get rid of the 
IRS, drastically lower taxes, elimi
nate many regulations, and elimi
nate the enormous capital gains tax, 
which is a terrible impediment to 
business activity.
I would have expected the storm of 
denunciation and snarling hatred 
that exploded against him tocome 
from the nearly socialist Democratic 
party, and much of it did. But a large 
amount came from the Republicans, 
the supposed champions of capital
ism. To their credit, a few prominent 
Republicans, such as Jack Kemp, 
did endorse Forbes. Many, however, 
didnt want to hear about it.
Instead, they threw all their sup
port to Dole, a man with no ideas, no 
desire to do much to change the 
status quo.
If the behavior of Republicans in 
regard to Forbes isnt bad enough, it 
pales beside that of the small but 
solid minority that supports the can
didacy of Patrick Buchanan. The 
most that can be said in defense of 
his supporters is that they are people 
hungry for ideas, for values, some
thing of which Dole, certainly, offers 
little.
Unfortunately, the ideas that
Buchanan has to offer are both fool
ish and outright evil.
His ideas for the economy show a 
basic lack of understanding of eco
nomics and a lack of morality.
He proposes, to begin with, impos
ing stiff tariffs on Japan, due to our 
large trade deficit, especially in the 
automobile market.
Americans buy numerous Japanese 
cars, and the Japanese buy few of 
ours, therefore the government must 
become involved.
He ignores the fact that the Japa
nese sell more cars here simply be. cause they make a better product at a 
lower price.
He also proposes that in order to 
protect American jobs from low-priced 
foreign competition, that we should 
impose tariffs on poor countries like 
Mexico, until such time as their wages 
rise and are thus competing more 
fairly with Americans.
How the Mexicans are supposed to 
achieve prosperity when enormous 
tariffs are imposed against the only 
products they are able to produce for 
export is beyond my understanding.
Buchanan has gained great popu
larity among those who are uncer
tain about the future, those in indus
tries that are declining or dead.
He snarls a great deal about the 
ruthless thugs of Wall Street, who 
enact massive layoffs in order to boost 
their stock values.
He conveniently ignores that all 
the massive layoffs and short-sighted 
thinking on the part of business are 
due entirely to the government.

Important drug certifications soddened by bureaucracy
James Stepanek
Ive been talking about government 
intrusion in peoples lives for a while 
now. Ive mentioned how it can cost 
you money, opportunities,- and possi
bly your job. Now Im going to get into 
something which, while not in the 
news too much right now, is even 
more important: the government in
trusions which could cost you your 
life. No, this will not be something 
about black-clad BATF agents. Im 
talking about the FDA and how they 
keep medicines that could potentially 
save many lives out of peoples hands.
The US has probably the most oner
ous drug certification process in the 
world. Not only are drugs tested for 
harmful properties, but also for effi
cacy, which is a bit ridiculous. This 
may sound like a good idea (dont 
want any snake oil salesmen), but if 
you think about it, its nonsensical, a 
waste of money, and a waste of time 
that prevents much needed pharma
ceuticals from helping people. Do you 
think that a company would peddle a 
drug that didnt work or that a doctor 
would prescribe such a drug? Yes, 
weve seen movies about evil drug
companies which would do such things, 
but lets face it, thats the stuff of para
noid fantasy. Further, considering the 
kind of legal action and bad publicity 
that companies would face for such a 
case of fraud, its an inconsequential 
threat at best.
The simple reality of the matter is that 
there is no gain from making a drug that 
doesnt work. The market itself would 
kill it: The profits from the drug would 
not be very great since'people would 
soon find out that it didnt work. Does 
anyone really think that well only real
ize that a drug doesnt work if the gov
ernment assures us that it doesnt? The 
issue of drug certification actually came 
to be a thorny issue recently when AIDS 
drugs were being developed but the pro
cess was dragging due to government 
and FDA slowness. This made AIDS 
activists have a screaming fit, and the 
approval process for these drugs was 
sped up and rightfully so. I do laud this 
move on their part since.it is such a 
horrid disease, but I would still criticize 
the FDA for leaving drugs which deal 
with other just-as-life threatening con
ditions stuck in the bureaucratic mire. 
Just because cancer victims dont scream 
as loudly as the AIDS sufferers, do they 
deserve to die?
Another problem with the system is 
that the process is so lengthy and diffi
cult that it- drives prices through the
roof. Just think about the way any bu
reaucracy works: Abureaucratin charge 
of a project can never err on the side of 
caution. If he takes too long no one will 
care, even if it means that thousands die 
for the lack of a cure. On the other hand, 
if he lets a drug through which causes 
harmful effects in a few people, his ca
reer is ruined. In addition, by the time 
the drug company complies with all the 
regulations and procedures, it probably 
adds another dollar to the cost of every 
dose.
Now of course you are just going to 
assume Im being a anti-government 
crank again. Well, governments of other 
industrialized nations approve drugs 
much more quickly than ours. Our ap
proval times are twice as long and our 
development times are 75% higher. Do 
you think our scientists are that much 
less bright? Our companies have so much 
fewer resources? No, its the inefficiency 
of the bureaucracy and the over regula
tory mindset. Does anyone care to sug
gest that the social democracies of Eu
rope care less about their citizens than 
we do? I would doubt it. In fact maybe 
they care more since they allow these 
much needed drugs to be available more 
quickly.
Adding further to the frustration of 
the system, the US limits severely how a 
drug must be administered. This basi
cally limits all new drugs to oral doses if
they are to be administered by the pa
tient. This limitation puts a very strong 
roadblock to the ability to develop phar
maceuticals as it is often much easier to 
develop things for introduction into the 
bloodstream. Mind you, this restriction 
stems from the Drug War and was 
introduced because of the almost para
noid fear of hypodermic needles in the 
hands of the common citizen. One could 
try to dismiss this as a trivial complaint, 
but if this restriction had been in place 
back when insulin was being developed, 
diabetics would live a very constrained 
life in comparison to the full lives they 
lead today. Knowing a couple of diabet
ics and how much self administered in
sulin has enabled them to have a rela
tively normal life, Id say this restriction 
would have been a nightmare.
Matters could have even been worse 
at US pharmaceutical corporations to
day. During the Clinton assault on the 
US health care industry, the primary 
bogeyman was the pharmaceutical in
dustry.
Hillary et al railed strongly against 
the profiteering companies (though she 
did conveniently sell short on a number 
of such companies before beginning the 
verbal assault), suggesting that they 
overcharge and are the main cause of 
overpriced medical care. Considering 
that ( a) the process of FDA approval is so 
long and tricky that less than half of the
drugs make it through the process 
and (b) development costs are ex
tremely high, Id say the prices are 
necessary in order to recoup the 
investment and provide an economic 
motivation to research. Without the 
incentive of profit, life-saving drugs 
would not be developed.
After all, who would build expen
sive laboratories and employ thou
sands of researchers at consider
able risk just to break even? Y es the 
drugs do cost a lot, but pharmaceu
tical companies still go under all 
the time. The risks in the industry 
are quite great especially with the 
government stacking the deck 
against them.
All in all, one has to realize that 
theres something very wrong. Its 
not about companies trying to screw 
us by withholding life-saving prod
ucts to get our money.
Its about bureaucrats delaying 
much needed drugs to cover their 
behinds.
This is probably the most clear 
cut example of what the govern
ment can do when it screws up the 
free market  it can cost you your 
life.

Republican candidates conflict with morality, economics
mRILFG.k8ugf vUnS HalM j
The enormous taxes leveled 
against corporations and the con
fusing, contradictory regulations 
imposed on them make it near 
impossible for American firms to 
compete successfully and engage 
in long range planning.
Buchanans sort of economics 
never works, and when it seems 
to, it is more than offset by the 
damage it causes elsewhere.
Morally, his economics are re
pugnant. I shall state it simply: 
There is no such thing as a right 
to a job and there is no such thing 
as a right to be free from unfair 
competition. The only right man 
has is to his own life, the only 
right he can demand of another is 
the right to be left alone. The only 
moral purpose of government is 
the protection of individual rights. 
The economic policies of 
Buchanan, and every other stat
ist, are a grossly immoral viola
tion of hum an rights. Dont people 
have a right to choose whom to do 
business with? Why should they 
be forced to spend more of their 
money, when there is no earthly 
reason for them to do so? Dont 
the business owners, the produc
ers, have rights? Dont they have 
the right to decide how to run
their business, dont they have a 
right to their profits? Apparently 
not, according to Buchanan.
Some of his most repulsive ideas 
he in the area of immigration. 
There is a legitimate problem 
with illegal immigration, in that 
some illegal immigrants coming 
here are on public welfare. The 
solution to this problem is to com
pletely eliminate welfare. 
Buchanan does, at least, support 
elimination of welfare, if only for 
illegals, but then goes further. 
He proposes such things as erect
ing huge fences along the Mexi
can border to keep out illegals, 
most of whom come here in search 
of jobs, not handouts. What re
ally makes me furious, though, is 
his desire for a five-year morato
rium on all legal immigration.
These are people who did not 
come here for handouts. These 
are the people who came here 
with nothing, and started work
ing, at whatever jobs they could 
find, and they worked 70 to 80 
hour weeks. They worked, they 
saved, they educated themselves, 
and they succeeded. Today, they 
send their children here to be 
your classmates. These people, 
no matter what land they came 
from originally, were Americans
before they even stepped foot in 
this country. They embody the 
American spirit more than most 
people bom here, certainly more 
so than those who follow 
Buchanan whining for the gov
ernment to protect their jobs from 
foreign competition. These are 
the sort of people who make 
America great; these are the 
people that Buchanan wants to 
keep out.
His worst aspect, though, is his 
affiliation and agreement with 
the goals of the Christian Coali
tion. Now I should state that con
servative Christians do have 
some legitimate complaints, and 
rightly feel that they are being 
oppressed. The problem that the 
government has increasingly in
truded into areas of life that it 
has no business in, one glaring 
example of which is education. 
The solution to this is to get the 
government out of the personal 
lives of Americans, an example of 
which would be abolishing the 
public school system.
However, Buchanan and many 
like minded Christian conserva
tives dont stop there. They are 
perfectly happy to have public 
schools, so long as they have con
trol over them. They are perfectly
happy to continue forcing people 
to pay for the public schools, as 
well as for parochial private 
schools through voucher systems. 
They dont merely oppose liber
als forcing their values on others, 
they want to be the ones doing 
the forcing.
Instead of buying SurfWatch, 
they want to enact a hideous act 
of censorship.
Instead of turning the TV off, 
they want the FCC to get back to 
dictating morality.
Their willingness to ignore and 
violate human rights is nowhere 
more evident than the issue of 
abortion. Buchanan whole
heartedly supports an outright 
ban on abortion. To reinstate a 
ban on abortion would be an un
speakable violation of human 
rights, but most Republicans have 
no trouble with it.
So much for the champions of 
freedom.
Buchanan will not be the Re
publican nominee, but he will 
certainly influence the Republi
can Party.
As it is, Dole already shares his 
views on abortion, and he may 
possibly adopt many of 
Buchanans other views.
This sad state of affairs leaves
little hope for the future.
Last week, Jason Togyer wrote 
in his article (Downsizing fails 
to solve dire economic problems, 
3/11/96), Something bad is hap
pening, kiddos, and Im worried, 
too. Anyone out there have any 
answers but the easy ones?
Yes, something bad is happen
ing. We are witnessing the pro
gressive decay of what was once 
the greatest nation ever to rise on 
earth. The roots of this decay are 
philosophical.
Although it was implied in the 
founding of America and implic
itly accepted by its creators, 
America has never had an ex
plicit moral justification.
That fatal flaw has allowed over 
time, by default, for the enemies 
of freedom to take over.
The solution to todays prob
lems is to, in thought, recognize 
that reality is an absolute and 
that the rational use of your mind 
is the only way to deal with it. 
Neither God nor the state nor 
wishing will miraculously cure 
the nations ills.
The only thing that can do that 
is rational thought, translated 
into rational action.
In ethics, to recognize that man 
is a sovereign individual, whose
right to his own life is inviolate. 
Discard the disgusting morality 
of altruism that states that man 
must five for the sake of others. 
The only obligation one man owes 
to another is to leave him alone. 
In economics, complete lassezfaire capitalism is the solution;
Get rid of the taxation and regu
lations, and let the men able to 
produce do so. In politics, recog
nize that the sole moral purpose 
of government is to protect indi
vidual rights, which means to 
protect men from the initiation of 
force and fraud. Get rid of every
thing else.
As to whether this is an easy 
solution, its not. It requires you 
to fight against intense opposi
tion from both liberals and con
servatives.
It is the only way, however, to 
rescue this country from the 
downward spiral it is in. To save 
it, you must stand up and uncom
promisingly fight, in principle, 
for freedom, and demand it of 
this countrys leaders.
Nothing less will do.

March Madness continues to plague columnist
The Sixth Man
by Ronak Singhal
a Well, week one of the NCAA 
tournament is finally behind us. 
And, as usual, there were quite a 
few surprises, but for the most 
part, those who were expected to 
be standing after the last four 
days are still around. Heres a 
quick rundown of the weeks ac
tivities:
Biggest upset: It will take an 
absolute miracle for any game 
that is played the rest of the way 
fhis year to surpass the excite
ment generated by Princetons 
thrilling 43-41 win in the first 
1ound over UCLA. It was 
Princeton coach Pete Carills last 
tournament, and his players 
made sure that he would remem
ber his final trip. The Tigers used 
their patented style of slow-down 
basketball, waiting for the per
fect shot, to frustrate the much 
more talented defending cham
pions. Alas, this story ended al
most as quickly as it started when 
Mississippi State demolished 
Princeton in the second round 
when Princeton had no answer 
for Miss. States monster center, 
Eric Dampier. Runner-up: Drexel 
over Memphis.
Cinderella: The lowest seed 
remaining in the tournament is 
the Arkansas Razorbacks, a num
ber 12 seed. Although they were 
in the national championship 
game last year, they lost all their 
starters, and many people even 
felt that they did not deserve the 
at-large bid they received this 
year. But Nolan Richardson has 
brought his troops together at 
the right time, and has them play
ing that helter-skelter style that 
he loves. They should give Mas
sachusetts a very interesting 
game in the next round.
Biggest Disappointment: 
This is a tough one to decide. On 
the one hand are the Memphis 
Tigers who were considered to be 
a Final Four caliber team. But 
Malik Rose, the second-leading 
rebounder in NCAA history, led 
Drexel to the major upset over 
the Tigers in the first round, dis
patching any thoughts that they 
may have had of the Final Four.
But an even bigger disappoint
ment has got to be the Big Ten 
Conference. For the second 
straight year, this conference 
gathered a horde of at-large bids, 
only to watch all their teams go 
up in flames quickly. Even with a 
number one seed, the Big Ten 
could not get a single team into 
the Sweet 16, as Purdue, Indi
ana, Penn State, Michigan, and 
Iowa all made quick exits. You 
knew Purdue was in trouble when 
they had to rely on a shot at the 
buzzer rimming out for the West
ern Carolina Catamounts in or
der to beat that number 16 seed.
Biggest Surprises: Another 
tough one to call. First, there is 
Texas Tech, the team with only 
one loss, but without much of a 
basketball pedigree. They came 
into the tournament without hav
ing played an impressive sched
ule, and then they almost crashed 
and burned against Northern Il
linois. But they pulled that first 
game out and, in the second 
round, completely destroyed 
North Carolina. Now it remains 
to be seen if they can handle Allen 
Iverson and Georgetown in the 
next round.
Second, there is the Southeast 
Conference (SEC). For most of 
the year, this conference could 
have been called Kentucky and 
Everybody Else.Then came Mis
sissippi States coming out party 
in the SEC tournament against 
Kentucky, followed by Arkansass 
two victories and Georgias upset 
of number 1 seeded Purdue. Its 
been the SEC making the most 
noise so far.
Look ahead: Coming up this 
Thursday and Friday are the next 
eight games of the tournament, 
with most of the games offering 
very intriguing match-ups. The 
best pair of games should be on
Thursday night in Lexington, 
Kentucky where Connecticut will 
have to try to contain Eric 
Dampier and Mississippi State, 
while the other game at that site 
features Georgia Tech against 
Cincinnati. The best chances for 
upsets look to be in the Texas 
Tech-Georgetown game and in 
the Louisville-Wake Forest game. 
And, of course, the most antici
pated game of 'next weekend 
would be Georgetown-Massachusetts showdown to determine who 
goes to the Final Four.
I still say that it will be 
Georgetown, Kentucky, Connecti
cut, and Kansas heading to the 
Final Four, but keep your eye on 
Syracuse. If they can get by Geor
gia, they might be able to pull an 
upset on Kansas.

mate, Alonzo Mourning. Oh yeah',: 
so is some guy named Shaq. How 
good is the free agent market?
Remove the aforementioned 
Shaquille ONeal, Miller, andStockton from the U.S. MenJ? 
Olympic Basketball Team atcd 
you can still build a free aggii 
Dream Team, probably betted 
than the one selected. Imagir&j 
starting lineup of Payton, JSHE 
dan, and Mourning, with Magic? 
and Howard at the forwards* & 
second unit of Anderson, Hotra^ 
ton, Gilliam, Grant andMutombo; 
would be just as talented as anjp 
Olympic second squad and play ai 
lot less selfish basketball.
Is it unusual for so much talent, 
to be up for grabs? Yes, but get 
used to it. Under the CBA, first 
round draft picks may only signrelatively low-salary, short-rangjedeals. Two years from now many 
talented three-year veterans may; 
be tired of losing and simply sigji? 
for less with a winner.
This years best teams have ti; 
most to lose. Orlando has fcK 
leagues thi ,d-best record, but an; 
hardly stand to lose Shaq. 3SE 
though Shaqs teammates are 
talented and played well withqtrfr 
him early this season, the entity 
offense revolves around him;; 
Without the big guy in the middle;: 
Orlando would be fighting to', 
make the playoffs. Rumor is that, 
the town is not big enough for: 
him and that he may bolt to LvA"'
Seattle, with the second-best, 
record, depends heavily on Gary . 
Payton. Shawn Kemp has becdifijg; 
the teams go-to guy, but ifc& 
Payton who runs the up-tempou 
game and defends the other Wes

Chicago is the best in 
league, but also has the mosKffl? 
lose. Rodman has been the aiiv 
swer at power forward and his 
rebounds would be sorely missed. 
Its hard to think of Jordan asanything but a Bull, but legends 
in sports have recently been 
known to move on (Wayne 
Gretzky, Joe Montana).
If anything is clear, its that 
nothing is clear at all. Many play
ers may stay put, or Pat Riley 
could be coaching an all-star team.

Big-name trades shake up NHL
From the Point
by Jason Andracki
It was Lets Make a Deal Week in the 
NHL in the week leading up to the March 
20 trading deadline. All three trades in
volved big-name players as teams tried to 
solidify their rosters for a run at the 
Stanley Cup.
The first move wasnt so much of a 
surprise, as the New York Islanders 
shipped left wing Wendel Clark, 
defensemanMathieu Schneider, and farm 
hand Denis Smith to the Toronto Maple 
Leafs for defenseman Kenny Jonsson, 
center Darby Hendrickson, jun
ior winger Sean Haggerty, and a 
1997 first-round draft pick.
Clark made it known that he 
didnt want to be on the Island, 
and it was only natural to re
turn him to the town where he 
was called the Mayor.
For the Leafs this was a good 
move in preparation for the post
season, and for the Isles its a 
rebuilding one. In Jonsson, they 
get a defenseman who will prob
ably achieve Schneiders level in 
a few years, and in Hendrickson 
they get a young third-line cen
ter for their often-injured young 
team. Although Haggerty re
mained in juniors with the Leafs, 
on Long Island he may get a 
chance to play for his hometown.
While Isles general manager Mike 
Milbury was clearly looking towards the 
future when he made this deal, for the 
Maple Leafs this was a more of a short
term move as they battle for a spot in the 
Western Conference playoffs. Clark will 
certainly look great with Doug Gilmour 
and Mike Gartner, giving those speed
sters more ice to work with, and the addi
tion of Schneider to the defensive corps 
that consists of Larry Murphy, Dave Ellett, 
and Todd Gill, make their blueliners sec
ond only to the Chicago Blackhawks.
Before this week, I wouldnt have picked 
the Leafs to survive the first round, but 
now they have some potential for a long 
playoff run.
Following this blockbuster, the Leafs 
made another deal that was no surprise, 
except that it happened so soon. They 
shipped Dave Andreychuk to the New Jer
sey Devils in a payroll-cutting move for 
two draft picks. Who needs aging twomillion-dollar left wings? Obviously this 
deal has more immediate impact for the
Akira Hasegawa/Tartan Art Staff
Devils, who are just trying to make it 
into the playoffs to defend the Stanley 
Cup. Andreychuks 20 goals and 24 as
sists actually looks impressive on the 
anemic Devils stat sheet.
The final move involved the New York 
Rangers shipping three centers, Ray 
Ferraro, Nathan Lafayette, and Ian 
Laperriere; under-achieving defense
man Mattias Norstrom; and a fourthround pick in the 1997 draft to the Los 
Angeles Kings for left wing Jari Kurri, 
defenseman Marty McSorley, and right 
wing Shane Churla.
The three centers will have to pick up 
the slack from the departure of Wayne 
Gretzky, and Norstrom may blossom 
now that hes out of Brian Leetchs 
shadow. The Kings now have a younger 
roster and should be improved next sea
son, while Kurri and McSorley may pro
vide the punch that the Rangers need to 
return to the finals.
All this action happened with five days 
remaining before trading ends for the 
season. This is not the end of the trad
ing by any means. After all, Toronto 
GM Cliff Fletcher said, Im not through 
trading. There will be other moves.
Look for one of those moves to be a 
right winger, possibly Pittsburghs 
Markus Naslund. The moves made 
before the deadline may seem like 
they will be anti-climatic after this 
week, but look for even bigger names 
to change jerseys, like Chicagos Jer
emy Roenick.

NBA talent 
up for bid
At the end of the season, the NBA will 
introduce its own version of .Uw HSl1w ls 
rloU9t You see, the NBA is for sale. Or at 
least its players are. Under the new Col
lective Bargaining Agreement (the one 
that averted an NBA strike season), up to 
127 players may become free agents.
Commissioner Stern, whats the next 
item up for bid? How. about Michael Jor
dan, one of two men to lead the league in 
scoring seven straight years? Too expen
sive? Try a Reggie Miller on for size. Not 
enough room under the cap? Bid for the 
disgruntled Latrell Sprewell, a sure bet to 
leave the Bay. If that doesnt suit your 
needs, haggle down for Alan Houston, the 
other young Detroit Piston star.
Need a point guard? You have your choice 
of the all-time assist leaders (John Stock
ton and Magic Johnson), young talent 
(Kenny Anderson and Gary Payton), or 
the usual free-agent cap fillers.
Do you have a vacancy at forward? The 
markets full of them. Take your choice of 
rebounder Dennis Rodman, scorer Armon 
Gilliam, role-player Horace Grant, or 
young all-star Juwan Howard. Did I men
tion centers?

Sri Lanka claims World Cup cricket championship
''y'- /i
W jjp
nmk
International Sports
by Rahul Aggarwal
March 17,1996, will always be 
remembered by Sri Lankans as 
the greatest moment in their 
sporting history: The day when 
captain Arjuna Ranatunga held 
the Wills World Cup Cricket 1996 
Trophy aloft and the whole 
cricketing world acknowledged 
Sri Lanka as the new kings of 
one-day cricket. They had proved 
all doubters 
wrong by comthe last World Cup, they find 
themselves crowned as the new 
World Champions. Before the 
tournament had even started, Sri 
Lanka was insultingly priced at 
33-1 to win the World Cup. They, 
had shown signs on their recent 
tour of Australia that they were a 
decent one-day outfit but they 
were guilty of inconsistency and 
complacency. Not anymore.
Sri Lanka won the toss and put 
the Aussies in to bat on a flat 
Lahore pitch. Ranatunga had al
ways said that he prefers to chase 
scores, and who can argue with 
the massive depth of batting in 
the side? Australia got off to a 
flier, despite the cheap loss of 
Mark Waugh. Mark Taylor pun
ished anything short and raced 
to 50 in no time. He was ably 
assisted by Ricky Ponting, 
and at
Sanath Jayasuriya  to careless 
errors. Sri Lanka needed a calm 
influence, and who better to come 
in next than DeSilva? He timed 
the ball beautifully and put on a 
priceless 125-run partnership 
with Asanka Gurusinha (65). He 
was then joined by Ranatunga, 
and the two of them just picked 
runs with ease. DeSilvas innings 
were a joy to watch  he pierced 
the gaps with precision and 
played every ball on its merit  
dispatching loose balls to the 
boundary and blocking the good 
ones. Australias star spinner, 
Shane Warne, was hammered to 
all parts of the ground, and all he 
had to show for the game was a 
solemn face and figures of 10-0
58-0. The Aussies, for once, 
looked ragged in the field. Catches 
win matches and Australia didnt 
take theirs  putting down four 
chances. Sri Lanka had more-orless secured the game when 
DeSilva reached his century. He 
finished on 107* with Ranatunga 
(47*) hitting the winning runs. 
This was sweet revenge for Sri 
Lanka, who had suffered at the 
hands of the Australians earlier 
in the year.
Needless to say, DeSilva was 
man-of-the-match for his superb 
all-round performance  a cen
tury, three wickets and one catch. 
Sri Lanka took all the honors  
including the Wills Most Valu
able Player Award, which went
to Sanath J ayasuriya for his au
dacious batting that has allowed 
the Sri Lankans to post huge to
tals, and his contribution with 
the ball. The crowd, which was 
predominantly backing Sri 
Lanka, gave them a rousing ova-' 
tion when Ranatunga lifted the 
trophy. Sri Lanka had been the 
best side in the tournament and 
was a worthy winner. Their bat
ting has been sensational, their 
fielding buoyant, and there lias

Baseball club 
expects wins
By ALVIN GAVIN
.gS9ge M9g44 2Sl9wS
At the NCAA Division III Indoor 
Track and Field Championships that 
ran March 8-9 at Smith College in 
Northampton, Massachusetts, se
nior Melissa Baustert placed fourth 
in the nation in the 800-meter run 
with a time of 2:16:42. For Baustert, 
it was her third consecutive year of 
finishing in the top six runners at 
that distance.
At Kiski Area High School in 
Vandergrift, Baustert was prima
rily a sprinter. She was the 
Westmoreland County CoachesAs
sociation 300-meter hurdles cham
pion for three years. In her senior 
year, she was second in the WPIAL 
(Western Pennsylvania) and sixth 
in the PIAA (Pennsylvania) in the 
300-meter hurdles. However, 
womens track coach Dario 
Donatelli did not see her greatest 
success coming in the hurdles; he 
thought shed have to run a little 
farther for greatness.
She was not an 800-meter run
ner in high school, but I talked to 
her coach and saw some of her 
races and thought that she could 
run the 800, said Donatelli, who 
recruited Baustert out of high 
school. When he told Baustert 
wanted her to run the 800 meters, 
already figured it out.
i ai idi i rue rnuiu
Melissa Baustert was also a leading force on the womens 
cross country team.
that he I kind of knew that Id be running the 
she had 800 when I got here since I would be run
ning cross-country, and [the 800] was the
natural progression from the distance I 
was doing, Baustert said.
Bausterts freshman year was pretty non
descript. Her freshman year was her tough 
year to learn how to run it, sid Donatlli. 
However, she finished second in the nation 
in the 800 meters in her sophomore year. 
[Finishing second] shot her up into the.top 
girls. She knew she could run with them 
after that and she became more confident, 
Donatelli said. That confidence spread 
across the board, as Baustert became one of 
the best all-around female track athletes 
Donatelli has had.
Shes been th most versatile athlete 
Ive ever had, Donatelli said. Shes quali
fied for nationals in hurdles, the quartermile, and the half-mile. She holds school 
records in four different indoor and five 
different outdoor events. The only reason 
she doesnt have any more school records is 
that I havent put her in those events.
In Donatellis eight year tenure at CMIT. 
only one other runner achieved what Baustert 
has, and that runner won at the nationals in 
the 10,000 meters. If she has the kind of 
season in the spring that I think shell have, 
she could be one of the best weve ever had. 
Donatelli said of Bauste$;, who will run the 
800 and the 1,500 in the spring. Shes with
out a doubt the best middle distance runner 
Ive ever had at CMU.
Baustert was also honored as 
Westmoreland Countys College Sports 
Woman of the Year,' and has earned AllAmerica honors in the 800-meter run for the 
third straight year.
Swimmer makes CMU sports history
By SUDHIR REDDY
.gS9ge M9g442Sl9wS
Senior Rebecca Fruehan won 
two national events in the NCAA 
Swimming Championships at 
Emory Universityito become the 
first woman in CMU history to 
win a national title in swim
ming. Competing in the 100-yard 
freestyle, 200-yard freestyle, and 
500-yard freestyle, Fruehan 
placed first in the 100 with a 
time of 52.04, placed first in the 
200 with a time of 1:52,00, and
fourth in the 500 with a time of 
5:03.19. Fruehans time in the 
200 was her personal best, while 
the 100 was one of her best times. 
Fruehans success helped to place 
the CMU womens team 19th in 
tlie-nation of all competing Divi
sion III schools.
The national championships 
were held all last week as 
Fruehan raced on Thursday 
(500), Friday (200), and Satur
day (100). Each morning, there 
was a qualifying time to earn 
the right to compete in a cham
pionship meet later in the 
evening. Fruehan placed in the 
top eight in all three of her quali
fying events.
Although Fruehan came to 
the championships with high 
expectations, she was surprised 
by her performance. She said, 
I was looking to win in one 
event [which] was my highest 
expectation; to win two events 
is really exciting.
One of Fruehans biggest ac
complishments was winning 
the 100, in which she did not
expect to do well. Fruehan earned 
a chance to swim in the champi
onship race but had to swim in an 
outside lane due to a high quali
fying time earlier that morning. 
Respite the handicap, Fruehan 
still won the race.
Fruehan commented on her 
wins by saying, A national cham
pion was a goal I always wanted 
to obtain and to do it twice was 
above my expectations. It was a 
great feeling by representing 
CMU at the nationals and also to 
do so well in my senior year.

The baseball club looks to 
have a promising season this 
spring, building on last years 
record of 5-12 with some excel
lently qualified returning play
ers, plus some young new tal
ents as well.
Among those returning who 
will help the teams batting 
average are sophomore out
fielder Jon Zubiller (.450), se
nior third baseman Mike 
Monico (.362), junior outfielder 
Scott Kepp (.359), and sopho
more infielder J ay McCormack 
(.353). Seniors Anuj Gupta and 
Tom OFarrell and junior Joe 
Smarelli all hit over .300 this 
fall and will hope to put up 
similar numbers this spring. 
Monico and Kepp will also be 
partially responsible for pro
ducing some runs, as they got 
11 and 10 RBIs, respectively, 
last season.
Pitching-wise the team is led 
by senior Matt Beam, plus 
OFarrell, Kepp, andMcCormack.
In addition to all these play
ers, sophomore catcher Brian 
White will be a help 
both offensively and 
defensively.
Of the newcomers, 
freshmen outfielders 
Link Brown and 
Ramon Poo look to 
provide some punch 
at the plate, and 
freshman Jon Mayes 
and sophomore Albert 
Suh hope to be suc
cessful at the mound.
As well as Mayes and 
Suh, Steve Lopez,
Rich Seder, Doug 
Jones, and Brown will 
join the pitching staff 
this spring.
The team looks to 
possibly have a winning record, says head coach 
.Scott Smith, who believes the 
talent level of the club is now 
that of a legitimate Division III 
team. Because the club had 
been inactive before last spring, 
that season plus last falls sea
son were rebuilding times. But 
now, with the foundation set, 
expectations are much higher 
for this spring.
The team faces a very full 30- 
game season, including some 
tough teams like West Liberty 
State College, Allegheny Col
lege, Westminster College, and 
Geneva College. All games, 
though, said Smith, will be im
portant. Since the baseball 
team is a club, not a varsity 
sport, it is not a member of any 
conference or division, so each 
of the 30 games this spring will 
be weighted virtually the same.
Unfortunately, Carnegie 
Mellon still lacks a home base
ball field, so all games will be 
away. However, the April 12 
game against Geneva and May 
3 game against Franciscan 
University will be played at 
Three Rivers Stadium, home of 
the Pittsburgh Pirates.

This Saturday, the CMU fencing team 
hosted the Third Annual Holy Grail 
Championships. The Tartan fencers
went up against eight other organiza
tions to retake the Holy Grail from last 
years winner, Kent State University. 
Teams from Cleveland State Univer
sity, University of Rochester, Ohio State 
University, Taylor Alderdice High
,  >. ..
Gustavo Sganzerla/Tartari Photographer 
This past Saturday, the Tartan fencing team reclaimed the Holy Grail from last years 
winner, Kent State University.
School, Fencing for Fun fencing club, 
Salle Aramis fencing club, and Alcazar 
fencing club also competed for the cup in 
the foil, epee, and sabre events.
CMU won the Holy Grail by having 
the best overall record for the tourna
ment the team placed first in womens 
foil and took second in both 
menfs foil and sabre. The 
victory in the womens 
foil came early in the day, 
as the womens team, led 
by sophomore captain 
Tomoko Sano, rolled over 
the University of Roches
ter, 4520. We let the 
[University of Rochester] 
women know we rule,
Sano said. They couldnt 
even fight back. We all fin
ished very well.
The next placing perfor
mance of the tournament 
was the sabre teams sec
ond-place finish after just 
losing to the Cleveland 
State University varsity 
fencers. This squad was j^e jartans 
led by freshman captain 
Leonardo Booth, freshman Michael Lee, 
and doctoral student Michael Patterson.
The final points came from the mens 
foil teams second-place finish. Senior 
captain Anantachoke Osangthamanont, 
junior club president Thibaut de Barros 
Conti, Pitt student Cameron Harvey, 
and backup, freshman Andrew1 Mihal, 
made short work of their first two oppo
nents, the University of Rochester and 
Taylor Alderdice High School, to go on to 
the semi-finals. There, they narrowly 
defeated the Fencing for Fun squad, a 
private Pittsburgh club for veteran fenc
ers, by a score of 45-37. This win pro
pelled them to the finals against Kent 
State, where they were defeated 45-22.
Although not contributing to the scor
ing, the novice team of freshman cap
tain Jason Rennie, freshman William
Ross, freshman Matt Geyer, and mas
ters student Jeff Gannong had a very 
impressive performance, placing sixth 
in mens foil.
Early last month at the U.S. Team 
Nationals Qualifiers, the CMU fencing 
team qualified to participate in the U.S.
CMU needed to win the third-round 
match to qualify, and they had to face 
the more experienced Fencing for Fun 
team. The Tartans fell behind 10-8 in 
the first minutes of the match, but de 
Barros Conti struck back to retake the 
lead, 15-10. Bruno and Harvey kept

Nationals for the second year in a row. 
In this competition, the top two teams 
went to nationals, and the competition 
was very intense, with teams from Indi
ana University of Pennsylvania, En 
Garde fencing club, Fencing for Fun 
fencing club, and SabreMaster fencing 
club. The Tartan team was comprised of 
alumnus captain Randy Bruno, 
Osangthamanont, de Barros Conti, 
and Harvey.
The squad got off to a fantastic start 
in the first round, crushing IUPs foil 
team 45-10, but ran into trouble in the 
second round when they went up against 
the En Garde.Fencing Club. The En 
Garde team was led by two nationally 
ranked fencers with more than 10 years 
of experience each, and they defeated 
the Tartans solidly, 45-20.
on top of the competition to retain the 
lead, 25-19. The Tartan fencers kept 
up the attack, extending their lead to 1 
eventually take the match, defeating 
the more experienced Fencing for Fun 
team 45-27.
De Barros Conti was very pleased 
with all the teams this season. He. 
said, The Tartan fencing team had a 
very successful year: To win both of 
our invitationals and qualify' to the 
U.S. Nationals was unprecedented. 
Carnegie Mellon fencing has proven 
itself to be a strong fencing force in the 
region.
The Holy Grail Tournament marks 
the end of the CMU fencing teams 
regular season, although the club will-.-. 
send the,squad to the U.S. Nationals:

There has been a lot of controversy recently 
surrounding Hooters and the governmental 
order that they hire men. Debates about what 
restaurants like that represent, and a femi
nist questioning of the empowerment versus 
exploitation of Hooters Girls have all sur
faced in a heated moral and ideological discus
sion. Personally, I have never seen Hooters as 
a positive place for women. Purporting to be a 
delightfully tacky family restaurant, Hoot
ers makes a commodity of womens sexuality 
and sells it to men along with hot wings and 
fries. If this is our societal ideal of a family 
place, what are we teaching our children about 
gender roles and womens bodies?
Now the Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission has required Hooters to equally 
objectify men. Hooters has blatantly refused, 
circulating posters portraying exaggeratedly 
masculine men with mustaches and chest hair 
in Hooters tank tops and skimpy shorts, along 
with the slogan, Hooters Guys? Washington 
 Get a Grip! Their rationale is that men will 
change the whole nature of the restaurant; 
that Hooters Girls have become an interna
tional symbol of friendliness, comfort, and the 
American Way. This is all true. The American 
Way is incredibly sexist, relegating women to 
positions of service, subservience, and domes
tic comfort. Changing these implicit ideologies 
is a good and crucial thing.
Hooters also attempts to appeal to feminists 
by claiming that hiring men will take jobs 
away from thousands of women. Unfortunately, 
they fail to see that a real solution would be to 
improve the economic status of women so that
their most viable and profitable job choices 
are not ones in which they have to potentially 
degrade themselves. How many Hooters Girls 
would voluntarily keep their jobs if they had 
other choices, if they didnt live in a 
patriarchally-defined economy, and they 
didnt have to out of economic necessity?
The problem with both moral (Christian 
groups, conservatives) and feminist critiques 
of Hooters is that too often, the Hooters Girls 
become criminalized. Overall, we have to stop 
attacking the. women and start challenging 
the system that requires and allows Hooters 
to exist. Feminists say that women working 
at Hooters betray feminist beliefs and let 
themselves be exploited and demeaned just 
for money, but I would counter that almost 
wPwS0 industry a woman works in is going to 
be sexist and exploitive  from secretarial 
work and domestic service to skilled labor 
and stock market exchange. We would never 
think of condemning secretaries for willingly 
supporting the patriarchy; we shouldnt be so 
quick to condemn Hooters Girls. And in cer
tain ways, women that work at Hooters are 
propelling the feminist agenda forward: They 
are supporting themselves, acknowledging 
and using their own sexuality, and taking 
advantage of mens negative attitudes and 
intended objectification and using it for their 
own financial gain. There is a fine line be
tween promoting sexist stereotypes and us
ing those stereotypes against oppressors. Im 
not sure where Hooters falls on that line, but 
I would always rather empower than victim
ize women.
An interesting side issue, within this whole 
EEOC business of requiring Hooters to employ 
men equally, is something that has not even 
been addressed. That is the fact that Hooters is 
not required to equally employ women who are 
skinnier, fatter, shorter, taller, darker-skinned, 
more muscular, or more flat-chested than the 
typical Hooters Girl. In short, women that dont 
conform to the dominant (white) beauty ideal 
cannot work at Hooters. Like the inclusion of 
men, the hiring of more diverse women would 
turn the nature of Hooters on its head. Maybe 
then they would have to change their name 
from a disgustingly sexist slang word for breasts.

tory] in the arts, said Marge 
Myers, assistant director of the 
STUDIO, but it is strikingly 
similar to a 
research 
laboratory.
Students 
come to the 
SCI with a 
project in 
mind and col
laborate with 
the other fel
lows. They 
hold group 
meetings to 
discuss their The SCI is located 
work. They hire student interns 
to help run the organization. 
They present their work pub
licly when it has been com
pleted.
We want to contribute to new 
knowledge. [We see ourselves 
as] researchers, experimental 
contributors to human knowl
edge, said Myers.
Projects at the SCI have in
cluded a light dancer, who 
danced with mirrors on his body 
to reflect light and create dis
tinct visual effects, and virtual 
reality museums. Probably the 
most famous project right now 
is hn'Sew0 le9n 9Uw zlPleo dwvv7 
Less traumatic than abortion 
and more simple, is an interac
tive 3-D planetarium show that
brings viewers into cells, that is 
presently showing at the 
Carnegie Science Center.
Another ongoing project is 
Julian Thayers study of the cre
ative process and emotion in 
music. He is attempting to quan
tify the effects of music on emo
tions by measuring heart rate, 
perspiration rate, and respira
tion rate of performers and au
dience members. He will have 
performances where visual im
ages serve as the musical score, 
and the musicians will play 
based on their reactions to the 
images. Thayer will use images 
from hn'Sew0 le9n 9Uw zlPleo
in CFA
dwvv for many of his shows. He 
will be having a public perfor
mance on April 25 at the 
Manchester Craftsmans Guild 
in the North Side.
Artists generally find out 
about the SCI through word of 
mouth or various a national 
listings. Fellows are chosen 
through a proposal process by 
the director, Bryan Rogers, in 
cooperation with a steering com
mittee within the SCI. They 
take recommendations from na
tional group of artist residen
cies and from a CFA faculty 
advising committee.
Because arts funds are being 
cut rapidly in the present po
litical environment, the SCI 
tries to diversify its source of
Maciej Matyjas/Tartan Photo Staff
funds. Funding comes froifc 
CFA, the University, founda
tions in Pittsburgh, project 
funds from corporations, groups 
like the National Science Foun
dation, and on-campus units. 
No one has a huge burden for 
whats going on here and a lot 
get to participate, Myers said.
Much of the publicity for the 
STUDIO has centered on the 
technology, but Myers said, 
The art has to come first here. 
People see the technology as a 
means to make art, not art as a 
way to utilize technology. Al
though at first they had trouble 
with name recognition, they 
have become 
well known. 
The artistic 
community lo
cally and in gen
eral thinks its 
wonderful what 
were doing. Our 
reputation is 
fabulous  
[were seen as] 
groundbreaking. 
Its sort of dif
ferent [working 
here] than the rest of the cam
pus, said Micki Paley, a senior 
BHA in drama and psychology 
and architecture major. Paley 
finds that teh variety of people 
from a number of departments 
add to the diverse nature of the 
atmosphere.
Its a key into the outside 
world, she said.The conglom
eration of people that i get to 
work with is a good experience.
According to Paley, SCI 
recieves much recognition inter
nationally and because of this, 
she finds that it is a valuable 
resource to CMU.

By ANDREW WANG
.gS9ge M9g442Sl9wS
A1986 graduate of Carnegie Mellons H.John 
Heinz III School of Public Policy and Manage
ment, entrepreneur Thome Matisz, founded the 
Solotec Corporation iri Pittsburgh last year to 
market his new creation, the Drivn Plow, a 
device to remove snow from home driveways and 
small parking lots.
The first shipment of Drivn Plow is nearly 
sold out. The device has now gone through its 
ultimate testthist winter, during the Blizzard of 
1996 and passed with flying colors. The Drivn 
Plow is a consumer-friendly car snow plow that 
accommodates the majority of family cars, in
cluding minivans.
It allows users to sit in the warmth of the car 
rather than spending hours shoveling snow,1 
said Matisz. The device weighs only 43 lbs. when 
assembled. It has helped customers from West 
Virginia to Western Pennsylvania this winter.
Solotec utilized sophisticated computer de
sign and testing to develop the Driv n Plow. The 
prototypes were tested by Matisz and his design 
team near the Andes Mountains in Chile during 
the South American winter, at an altitude of 
10,000 feet, where they passed a three-day chal
lenge of pushing heavy snow.
After the 20 months it took to research and 
develop the product, Matisz had to find a way to 
sell the product. The first shipment of Drivn 
Plows were stored in his back yard as he tried to 
find some buyers for his invention. Most stores
wouldnt talk to him. He did much of the work 
himself while holding a full-time job. Through 
his determination, Matisz and Solotec have suc
ceeded in meeting their goals. He secured a dealwith Builders Square and nearly sold out his 
first shipment of 500 Drivn Plows. Now his 
product is available at Wal-Mart Stores, Build
ers Square and BJs Wholesale Clubs in the 
Northeast and other area suppliers.
 Solotec Corporation has been featured on 
KDKA TV and the Wall Street Journal. Solotec 
Corporation was established in 1995 to create 
products that facilitate independent living. Our 
goal remains to provide our valued customers 
worldwide with great designed products at an 
affordable price, said Matisz.
Solotec Corporations Drivn Plow is currently
priced at $279.96, and comes with a two-year 
warranty. Solotec also will have an accessory 
available for the Drivn Plow that will permit 
owners of sport utility vehicles and pick-up trucks 
to use the it.
Matisz is gearing up for an international 
launch in 1996 or 1997. He has received calls 
from many local people along with companies as 
distant as Switzerland and Austria.
As an entreprenurial start-up based in Pitts
burgh, Solotecs goal is to put a Drivn Plow in 
every garage in North America and beyond, 
said Matisz.
We certainly expect to grow and expect to 
create internship opportunities this summer for 
bright, creative, highly motivated people inter
ested in technological advancement.
Speaker discusses culture
By JOHN BIGGS
.gS9ge BnS'C uRl9nS
Every generation takes on 
the responsibilities and prob
lems of the generation be
fore it, said Jay Shapiro, a 
physicist, ex-Israeli army 
soldier, and former Aliyah. 
Shapiro spoke twice at Pitts 
Hillel Center last Monday, 
both times about the prob
lems facing the state of Is
rael.
Softspoken and humorous, 
Shapiro was full of anecdotes 
and messages. Whatever 
happens in Israel affects us, 
he said to a group of Jewish 
students. There is a severe 
identity problem between the 
disparate [Jews outside of Is
rael] and Israelites. He went 
on to say that Judaism is 
slowly becoming a hobby in 
Israel, where Americaniza
tion is beginning to reign. I 
asked one guy what he did 
on Saturdays and he said I 
surf. I asked another guy 
and he said I go to temple. 
Surfing, going to temple, I 
guess they are now the same 
thing, he said. However, the 
truth, according to Shapiro, 
has a more serious tone.
With the problems of ter
rorism and imminent conflict 
overshadowing Israel, the Jews
entering and living in the coun
try are in dire need of a core 
system of belief. Jews are los
ing their Jewishness, he said. 
The dream of a messiah, he went 
on to explain, was being lost to
Gabrien Symons/Tartan Art Editor
consumerism.
Like most modern societies,
pop culture has overshadowed 
traditional culture, and this, 
said Shapiro, is the problem of 
rwvlolne le LsSgwv, the title of 
his speech. He said, Israel is 
cutting itself off from the dis
parate but the most out
rage against the bombings 
is coming from outside the 
country. Most Jews have 
made it, but now what? 
Now what do we do? 
This, Shapiro went on to 
say, is the main problem 
facing Israel today. While 
terrorism and the peace 
process are problems, 
Shapiro said that to the 
Jewish people, problems 
happen and then more 
problems come with little 
resolution of the first prob
lems. The problem they are 
facing now, and one of the 
most important problems 
that they are involved in, 
is the loss of identity in 
Israel. The country came 
about because of an idea. 
But the Jews in Israel are 
failing to continue the 
spirit of Zionism.
Shapiro placed the con
flict between traditional 
and popular culture into a 
new light which will hope
fully alleviate the prob
lems facing the future of Israel 
and its people.

Activist explores effects of media on sexes
By SUSAN WATSON
.gS9ge M9g442Sl9wS
Ann Simonton, a former model and 
current womens rights activist provided 
CMU with an eye-opening look at the 
medias representations of men and 
women that promote violent relations 
between the sexes. Sponsored by the 
Womens Center in recognition of 
Womens History Month, Simonton ad
dressed gender issues that affect both 
men and women alike last Friday in 
Wean Hall. A member of Media Watch, 
a national organization that helps people 
become more critical of the media, 
Simontons task is a lot more difficult 
than it sounds. Its not like our message 
is going to be broadcast on local and 
cable television, said Simonton.
Simonton started her modeling career 
at the young age of 14 in the 1970s. She 
appeared on the cover of a number of 
mainstream magazines such as :no'w, 
MwPwe9wwe, and dnsCnNnvl9ge7 working 
with Eileen Ford; she moved to New 
York in her teens. While she was becom
ing familiar with her new setting, she 
was gang raped in Morning Side Park. 
Im not telling you this for sympathy, 
she said. Its comical in a sense because 
rape happens so much. These men had a 
knife at my neck. They were going to kill 
me because I was 4wCgvw.
Acoording to Simonton, acts of vio
lence against women oc
cur because women are 
looked upon as objects. Its 
much easier to harm an 
object than a human be
ing. If you live in an envi
ronment that makes people 
view women as objects, 
they are going to harm 
them. We have been taught 
to dehumanize women, and 
one of the main players in 
doing so is the modeling 
industry, she said.
Because of the implica
tions of the modeling in
dustry with women,
Simonton ended her mod
eling career and began edu
cating people as well as 
protesting; she has been 
arrested 11 times. How
ever, nothing will stop her 
from getting her views 
across to people who will 
listen. She said, I guess 
you could say Im a radical 
feminist or the f word. No
body wants to be hated, 
but I really dont care.
During Fridays presentation, ideal that is fed to us through the 
Simonton addressed many issues such hands of the media, 
as plastic surgery, dieting, alcohols Simonton also discussed the stereorole in rape and violence against types the media creates for men. She

equated with violence. He is bran
dished [sicl with a gun or weapon. He 
has to be dangerous. The thing is 
though, society doesnt understand 
what real war is like. They dont have 
any idea about the horrors of war. 
Ideas generated through the pages 
of fashion magazines, newspapers, 
and pomographicmediums imply that 
women are submissive and fearful. 
Simonton said, We are surrounded 
by women saying yes, in situations 
where they would obviously be saying 
no. Many times youll see them in 
positions where they are looking for 
aid or being victimized. We get a glam
orized view of domestic violence. It 
happens too frequently in this coun
try, and yet corporations are willing 
to use it to sell products.
Simonton explained that the media 
also conveys the beauty ideal, which 
is virtually impossible to be attained. 
As a result of this message, many 
women are continually questioning 
their physical adequacy. But 
Simonton believes that women need 
to be recognized for their achieve
ments. Their looks are secondary. She 
said, Women are always thinking 
their hips are too big, or their waist is too 
thick, or their legs arent just right. We 
need to understand that women are more 
important for what they accomplish in 
life. Its not about nails or eyelashes,
hair and makeup. We need to get away 
from those images. 
Member of the Womens Center and a 
seniorliterary and cultural studies and 
creative writing major, Amber Benezra 
said, People may learn something from 
what she has to say. Youre always aware 
of being a woman and what people need 
to see is that the beauty ideal is a 
myth. You dont have to fit into that. 
Erin Gay, a freshman Mellon College 
of Science student found the content of 
Simontons program to be explicit but 
extremely useful in conveying her mes
sage to the audience. She said, I came to 
this because it looked like she would 
have an in-depth perspective. Some stuff 
was shocking and grotesque, but I think 
she needed to do that.
Many are already aware of the nega
tive impact the media has on the atti
tudes of society, but few are willing to do 
anything about it. Bridget Hennessy, a 
freshman drama major said, I think 
Ann Simonton showed through slides 
and speech what we already know about 
our media but choose to ignore. She is 
saying, These particular images offend 
me and I say so! If they offend you, then 
say so! We accept far too much imagery 
of women in submissive, inferior, and 
object positions. Women are not infe
rior. We know this, so we can stop blindly 
accepting the images and begin to change 
toward a more unified world concept.

The Morning After Pill is a 
treatment that women can use to 
prevent pregnancy after having 
sex. If, for example, a condom 
breaks during sex, a woman for
gets to take a birth control pill, or 
is raped, it can be used to stop Planned Parenthood. There is 
pregnancy.
This is not RU-486, 
also known as the 
French abortion pill; 
this treatment is not an 
abortion at all. The

using the pills many times would 
be hard on the liver, due to the 
high dose of hormones taken. 
Said Holly, It was like a hor

There has been some contro
versy surrounding this option for 
women. Many in the pro-life 
movement oppose the use of the 
Morning After Pill. 
Scott Filippino, a 
freshman biology 
major, identifies 
himself as pro-life. 
You dont know 
when the egg has

This is a tough 
question to an

Tibetan tells story of abuse
By SHARMILA VENKATASUBBAN
.gS9ge Bwg9'Sws uRl9nS
Despite his softspoken words, Gindun Rinchen 
sent a grave message to his audiencethe voice 
of over 700 Tibetan prisoners at the hands of the 
Chinese government.
While one in four prisoners do not undergo 
physical abuse, I havent found any surviviors 
that havent been tortured in some way, said 
Rinchen.
A former Tibetan political prisoner, Rinchen 
spoke on campus last Monday in the Adamson 
Wing, his lecture sponsored in part by Pitts
burgh Friends of Tibet and the local chapter of 
Amnesty International. Rinchen has been on 
tour since February, spreading the word of the 
injustices committed against the people of Tibet, 
outlining the inhumane conditions and treat
ment Tibetans are forced to endure and the 
actions he has taken to change their situation.
Having recently escaped from Tibet, Rinchen's 
tour has taken an active role in bringing about 
change for Tibetans. The stories are no different 
than in Bosnia, he said.  It made me think to do 
something. How can I make myself useful for 
Tibetans? I asked.
Rinchen shared some of the horror stories he 
-has heard as well as those he has experienced 
first hand. Its easy to extract confession fron 
women, Ive heard Chinese officers say. A 15 
year old nun was stripped naked in front of 
males officers and then raped then killed.
In response to a question posed to him, if he 
had adaequate living arrangements while im
prisoned, he said, Oh, we even had a choice 
between spoiled rice porridge or rotten steamed 
bread, his ability to retain his sense of humor 
astonishing.
Rinchen shocked the CMU audience with ac
counts of random illegal arrests and torture 
sessions instead of procedural interrogations. 
I suffered an eight-hour interrogation with one 
break in the eveningthen it resumed from 10 
pm until 2 am, he said.  I was told that I would
be released after I confessed. That,of course, was 
not true. I was forbidden to tell anyone of my 
interrogation.
The first year that Western nations ever heard 
of the situation in Tibet was 1987 according to 
Rinchen and today numerous organizations, 
across the globe are pulling together to shed light 
on the oppressive nature of the Chinese 
govemmemt. Campaigners such as Amnsety in
ternational wrote letters until Rinchen was re
leased.
Rinchen, a tour guide, was arrested in 1993 for 
collecting information on the abuses perpetrated 
by the Chinese government. Before his release in 
May 1995, he was not aware of the campaigning 
that was going on in his name. They said that 
no power could save me* but Im living proof of 
your results, he said. I never, never dreamt 
that I would be released so soon.
Rinchen recievedhis education in India, where 
is is now residing. He will return to India until he 
can go back to Tibet.
, The main purpose ofthe organization is to 
stay as politically distant as possible, said George 
Dobren, a representative from Pittsburghs 
Friends of Tibet. In the last 25 years, the reli
gion, art, and culture of the Tibetans have suf
fered greatly.
We hope that through presentations such as 
this, the problems between Tibet and China can 
be resumed quickly, said Dobren.
Representing CMUs chapter of Amnesty In
ternational, Esther Park and Melissa Chan found 
the lecture to be a splash of cold water. A lot of 
people arent aware of whats going on, said 
Park, a freshman electrical and computer engi
neering major. [CMU students] are to preoccu
pied with work to think about things on a grander 
scale.
This makes you realize that you have to look 
beyond yourself, added Chan, a freshman unde
clared major in CIT.

Brazilian feature film fails to showcase directors talents
By RYAN DONOVAN
.gS9ge M9g442Sl9wS
rln7 ZO TwoSwws (misprinted in the 
Carnegie schedule as rln7 qOO TwoSwws^ is 
the first of several movies by the renowned 
Brazilian director Nelson Pereira dos 
Santoss that the Carnegie will be showing 
between now and April 25.
What: Rio, 40 Degrees 
Director: Nelson Pereira 
dos Santos 
Country: Brazil
Its also dos Santos first feature film, 
and being a first try, its not perfect.
This film, made in the 1950s, follows a
day in the life of several poor black kids who try 
to survive in Rio de Janeiro by selling peanuts 
on the streets. It also follows the parents, 
siblings, and several vestigial characters, whose 
relationship to what appears to be the main 
storyline is never explained. Thats the major 
failing of this movie  too much goes on. There 
are about 1,057 different plotlines that are con
tinually switched between during the film. Its 
like going to a buffet and getting loads of appe
tizers and a sandwich  you may have had a lot 
there, but it isnt very satisfying.
All these plotlines wouldnt be so bad if they 
only connected in some cohesive way, besides 
the fact that the characters may have appeared 
in the same scene together (though they never 
interact).
I kept telling myself, The plotlines will come 
together soon in some amazing way and the
whole movie will make sense. It never hap
pened. The movie just kept adding new subplots 
and characters.
As it added these subplots, it raised new ques
tions about the characters (and tons of questions 
about why these subplots were even here), and 
left many of these questions unresolved. The 
ending only resolved one of the many storylines 
for me, and it did tie a few subplots in, but there 
was far too much left unclear.
I saw the main focus of the film as being the 
kids selling peanuts. This story held the great
est interest for me, as well as being the most 
clear and moving portions of the film. Then a 
subplot came along and pushed the kids aside. 
Like one about a soccer player who joins the 
home team, replacing the older, more beloved 
player.
The only connection this one has to the film is
the fact that the jilted lover of one of the 
kids sisters watches the game.
Its really unfortunate that rln, ZO Tw
oSwws diverges so much from its focus on the 
peanut-vending kids, because through 
them, the film was exploring the harshness 
of Rio life, and the racism and scorn these 
kids have to endure.
The Brazilian government even censored 
this film because of this realistic portrayal 
of the poor Brazilian blacks. All the Portu
guese whites depicted in this film treat the 
black children like criminals, and look down 
on them like animals.
Im sure that this movie is not a true 
judge of dos Santos ability as a film maker 
today. Tthis was his first attempt at fea
ture length films, and now hes got 40 years 
of experience under his belt.
Film and video series emphasizes international cultures
By TRACY ODELL
.gS9ge M9g442Sl9wS
Thinking of going to catch a movie, but you want 
something more than the same overused plots 
played out by the same stale actors? The Carnegie 
Museum of Arts Department of Film and Video is 
currently offering a pleasant 
alternative (if you dont mind 
reading subtitles) with its lat
est film series featuring films 
from New Zealand, Japan, 
and Brazil. Each weekend 
until the end of April, the 
Carnegie offers highly ac
claimed works from these 
three countries with occa
sional guest speakers to 
present. In an attempt to proNine films commemorating women in Japanese 
cinema are being shown in conjunction with an 
exhibit at the museum entitled A GlRRwe .Swgs'Sw) 
hgNgewsw HSle9s from the Carnegie Museum of Art, 
which begins March 23 and runs through June. 
Featured filmsinclude Hiroshi Shimzus WRnSlin7 
which ran Saturday, and nl1Ul GlogsU:s7 .Uw
The Women in Japanese Cinema series is being 
funded in part by the Japanese Studies Program at 
the University of Pittsburgh, the Toshiba Interna
tional Foundation, and the Japan Iron and Steel 
Foundation.
The third film series being offered is the Nelson 
Pereira Dos Santos Series which embodies a selecvide a look at other cultures, 
the museum is showing films 
that normally would never be 
shown in the Pittsburgh area.
The New Zealand series fea
tures recent films exploring a 
variety of cultural issues of 
personal and historical sig
nificance. Interest in the New 
Zealand cinema increased re
cently with the widely suc
cessful GwgPwev0 dSwg9'Sws7 
which plays at the end of April, 
and We1w 3wSw 3gSSlnSs7 the most successful film 
in New Zealand history, which opened the series. 
Also highlighting the group are a number of speak
ers including Martin Blythe, a film expert, who 
spoke at the showing of the newly-released directors 
cut of Geoff Murphys ,9'7 Friday night. Other 
guest speakers scheduled include Merata Mita on 
March 22 before bg'Sl and Gregory Waller before 
the showing of Barry Barclays *og9l7 April 12.

Asian Studies Programs.

the University of Pittsburgh. On April 6, Tatsu 
Aoki, a Chicago artist and musician, will present 
an innovative exhibition of experimental films

sistant curator of film and video at the museum, 
describes b0 znPw Ggs !wwe !'Seleo (April 20) as

for the novice foreign film viewer because it was

tion of films by the celebrated Brazilian director. 
These films aS# being circulated by the Brazilian 
consulate and have only been seen in about five 
places across North America. Once the films leave 
the continent, they will travel to Zurich for show
ing and then be returned to Brazil where they will 
probably not be placed in regular distribution, 
making this a truly rare opportunity. Dos Santos is 
credited with changing Latin American cinema 
from glossy Hollywood imitations to films which 
truly reflect the regions history and culture. The 
series of 13 films is made possible by the Center for
Latin American Studies at the University of Pitts
burgh and is presented in cooperation with the 
Foreign Ministry of Brazil.
All the films are being shown at the Museum of 
Art Theater, located on Forbes Avenue very close 
to campus, and admission is only four dollars for 
students and five dollars for general admission, 
making it less ex
pensive than a 
trip to the movie 
theater.
Whe-ther you 
consider yourself 
a novice or an ex
pert at foreign 
.films, the series 
can be enjoyed. 
Geryln Huxley, 
Assistant Cura
tor, says you 
dont need to be 
sophisticated, 
and though tlie 
novice might not 
know all the 
subtleties of the 
cultures, if you 
are interested in 
cinema, you will 
find the films inKenneth Namkung/ Tartan Art Staff teresting and 
pleasant. Specific 
information about show times and films can be 
found on the internet at www.clpgh.org/MOA/films.
This film series is an opportunity for students to 
see quality foreign films they normally would not 
be given the chance to view without having to 
travel or pay an expensive admission fee. Those 
who enjoy these films will be interested to note 
that at the conclusion of this series, the Carnegie 
plans to offer future series featuring films from 
Cuba, about jazz, and also a film series commemo
rating the 100th anniversary of world cinema.

New Zealand films illustrate strife of indigenous people
By ERIC SALZMAN
.gS9ge HwSsneewv bgegowS
For all its beauty and excitement, New 
Zealand is a country filled with racial contro
versy. Like in America and Australia, the 
British empire invaded New Zealand, rob
bing the indigenous people of their land.
What: Utu.
Director: Geoff Murphy 
Country: New Zealand
Natives to New Zealand are called Maoris. 
They share similar patterns with the native 
Americans and aborigines of Australia  
they find excessive poverty and alcoholism 
among their people as well as continued 
racial prejudice towards them from the white 
man.
Many of the selections from the New 
Zealand film festival now running at The 
Carnegie Museum illustrate the conflict be
tween the Maori and the white man. We1w 
3wSw 3gSSlnSs is perhaps the best know New 
Zealand film. Shown at The Carnegie on 
March 1, Lee Tamahoris wprld-renowned 
film outlines the problems of a modern-day 
Maori family. The film leaves most audience 
members with an incredible feeling of de
pression and sympathy for the characters 
who struggle through every day to make 
ends meet knowing that theyre people once 
were great warriors.
,9', screened last Thursday evening, takes 
the viewer back to when some of the Maori 
people still were warriors. Like the Holly
wood film ?wSnelCn, starring Jason Patrice 
and Gene Hackman, ,9' is about a rebel
band of indigenous survivors of the white mans retribution, atonement, honor, and justice  
invasion in the 1800s. Te Wheke, played by Anzac to the translation.
Wallace, first appears in the movie as a Maori scout By the end of the film ... ,9' is a tragedy,
for the British army.
Upon seeing the de
struction befalling his 
people, Te Wheke takes 
to the hills to lead sur
prise attacks on the 
British army as well as 
British settlers, to 
avenge the murder of 
his people.
Though a comedy by 
definition, ,9'7 directed 
by Geoff Murphy in 
1983, very seriously ex
plores New Zealand ra
cial controversies from 
the time of the occu
pancy that remain in the 
country today. Did the 
British have a right to 
take over the country?
What was and is now 
owed to the Maori 
people? How should the 
Maoris have reacted 
then, and how should 
they act now?
Martin Blythe, au
thor of *gCleo 9Uw 
W9UwS) LCgows n4 9Uw 
bgnSl le *w2 #wgvgeR
BlvC geR .wvwPlslne, gave a brief introduction to 
the screening and remained afterwards to an
swer questions.
Blythe spoke about the meaning of the word 
utu, which is Maori for what can perhaps best 
be translated into English with revenge. In his 
book, Blythe writes that reviewers have added
Heavenly Creatures is another New Zealand film being shown at the Carnegie 
series. The film will play at the Carnegie at the end of April.
Blythe wrote. On the other hand, when utu is 
resolved properly, it is also about the necessity 
and propriety of Maori and Paheka [white men] 
living together in the land of New Zealand/ 
Aotearoa.
One of the beauties of the film is that even 
those unconcerned with the Maori struggle could
gain much out of it because through the 
controversy within New Zealand, ,9' ex
plores the overall stupidity 
of war. Young men and 
women die. Homes andland 
are destroyed. In the end, 
no one wins.
New Zealand, as Blythe 
said before the screening, 
is often thought of as 
heaven on earth, even to
day. There is a great tour
ism industry in the coun
try. There are more beauti
ful beaches, mountains, and 
glaciers than any where in 
the world. The adventure 
sports in New Zealand cant 
be beat anywhere  after 
all, it is the country where 
bungee jumping began.
But there is much more 
to New Zealand than the 
beautiful scenery and ex
siting sports. There is a 
people there with a sad and 
beautiful history. The 
plight of the Maori remains 
one of the countrys most 
volatile issues even today, 
ivnramax Anyone interested in learnfilm and video ing more about this conflict, 
the Maori people, the coun
try itself, or the New 
Zealand cinema, should head down to The 
Carnegie to see more films like ,9't

dgSn'swv7 the internationally 
.acclaimed Rodgers and 
Hammerstein musical, is coming 
to, Pittsburgh April 2. Playing in 
;thfe musical are several CMU 
graduates, includ
ing Patrick Wilson 
an the starring 
role. During an in
terview with Wil
son I found out a 
little about the 
show, as well as 
life after CMU as 
a graduate of the 
drama depart
ment.
dgSn'swv is the 
story of the bitter,sweet marriage be
tween a gentle fac
tory girl and an 
amusement park 
barker. From its 
-start at the Royal 
National Theatre 
-of Great Britain to 
the present, dgSN'pswv has received 
extraordinary 
praise, as well as 
several awards, in
cluding five Tony 
Awards.
Wilson, who 
graduated from 
<3MU in 1995, has 
the starring role of 
Billy Bigelow. Wil-son spent the sum
mer of 95 in the 
Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera and 
went on to play the role of Chris 
in the first national tour of Miss 
Mglonet After that, he moved di
rectly into dgSn'swvt When I asked
experience as a student here he 
said, CMU molded me, kind of. I 
had a hell of a time there. It was 
great.
When I asked him what this 
role means to him, I was fasci
nated to learn that this has been 
a dream role for him for several
As I mentioned, Wilson was years. Four or five years ago, he 
previously touring with blss heard a friend playing and singMglonet Interestingly, dgSn'swv mg some of the music, and since 
is directed, produced, and cast by then he has been enamored with
the show.
Also starring in 
the show are CMU 
grads Sherry Boone, 
Shawn Palmer, Jef
frey James, and 
Katie Hugo.Wilson 
stated that they get 
along great and all 
coming from CMU, 
Its kind of a kin
dred thing when 
youve all been 
through it.
Less than a year 
out of college and 
already a success, 
where does Wilson 
plan to go next? He 
will be with dgSn'
swv for the next year 
but after that, hes 
not sure. Nobody in 
show business really 
knows what theyre 
doing next, he said. 
Ideally, he would 
like to be on Broad
way and be on a cast 
album. Eventually, 
he said he would 
even like to go into 
film. With a laugh, 
he said, A Tony 
wouldnt be too bad, 
but Im not so sure 
he was joking. From the sounds 
of it, he has a great chance and 
Im looking forward to seeing the 
show.

Executive Decision offers nothing new
The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  18 March 1996 .
By DAVID ELMAN
.gS9ge M9g442Sl9wS
Now its an executive decision. 
Right in the middle of the movie we 
come to understand this quote and the 
title it relates to. It seemingly has 
absolutely nothing to do with the sub
ject matter.
What: Executive Decision 
Director: Stuart Baird 
Company: Warner Bros.
If we then assumed that the upcom
ing action would not correlate with the 
plot, we would be correct. ujw1'9lPw 
Tw1lslne falls victim to perhaps the 
biggest flaw inherent in action movies: 
Although they 
may look nice, 
they are unteth
ered from all 
sense and plot.
The movie opens 
with a raid on a 
storehouse within 
Chechnya, where 
it is believed that 
toxic nerve gas is 
stored. However, 
the stuff never 
shows up, and it 
is soon forgotten.
Next we are wit
ness to the abduc
tion of a world-re
nowned terrorist, 
a scene seemingly 
lifted in whole, 
from Hg9Sln9 
?gCwst This terrorist then is turned 
over to the American embassy in Lon
don for extradition. As we can expect, 
this does not happen without conse
quences. Soon afterwards, an airplane 
is hijacked by his followers, led by his 
right-hand man, Nagi Hassan (David 
Suchet).
At first it is believed that this is only
a tactic to arrange the exchange of the 
travelers for the captive terrorist. David 
Grant (Kurt Russell), an Army intelli
gence specialist, has other ideas. He 
formulates a theory that the hijackers 
have the stolen nerve gas aboard and 
plan to blow it up over Washington,
D.C., killing millions of people. How he 
knows this is never really explained, but 
it sets up the rest of the movie, however 
improbable it may be.
The solution formulated for the prob
lem is simple in theory, if not in execu
tion. Why not fly soldiers up to the plane 
using top-secret technology, and put 
them inside? The man chosen to lead 
this operation is Austin Travis (Steven 
Seagal). Of course, Grantas well as the 
designer of the plane, Cahill (Oliver 
Platt) must come along to give advice.
Now the movie really takes off (no pun
intended). Using what looks exactly like 
a stealth bomber, they depart on their 
mission. As you can guess, they are 
successful and must save the world from 
impending evil.
Even within the world of action mov
ies, ujw1'9lPw Tw1lslneks plot seems 
weak. Parts seem pasted in from count
less other movies, both action and di
saster based. Employed are the cur
rent bad guys, Middle Eastern terror
ists, a bomb on a plane (think MNwwR^7 
cabin decompression (ever see 
?nvR4leowS^7 and an emergency land
ing by a pilot with little skill (check out 
8lSNvgew7 or the serious films it was 
based on). Every single thing that can 
go wrong is used in the movie, yet some
how it still holds together as not entirely 
unlikely. We believe that this is a logical 
course of events, once we have gotten 
past the idea that the planes saviors 
arrived in the first place.
The effects were quite bad for a major 
studio picture in some parts, with the 
worst being the early death of Austin 
Travis.
In fact, it was unclear why he was 
even necessary, except that the trailers 
got to mention Seagals name. The act
ing was acceptable 
for the most part, 
except for the 
strained Arabian 
accents of the hi
jackers and the sil
liness of some 
scenes. This in
cluded Grant and 
the other team 
members realiz
ing something all 
at once and jump
ing around like 
they had just 
found outthatMr. 
Green was the 
murderer in the 
library. Mo
ments like these 
 1996 Warner Bros, made me want to 
cringe, as did the 
last-minute deci
sion not to strike the airplane down, 
based on a dubious plot device. Put
ting all this aside, as an action movie 
it wasnt really all that bad, as con
tradictory as this may seem. It serves 
its purpose in exciting the viewer, 
despite how narrow a goal this ac
complishment represents.

Critic finds Tale terrible
By AMITKAR

Damn Gordon Sumner. Damn him. He lives in a 
castle in Wiltshire amidst beautiful English coun
tryside. He has a pseudonym that is cool for him 
but would be laughable if anyone else tried to use 
jt. He knows some secret Yogic technique that 
allows him to make love for five hours without 
losing control. And hes one heck of a musician.
Who: Sting 
What: Mercury Falling 
Label: A & M
Gordon Sumner, otherwise known as Sting, re
leased his latest solo effort, bwS1'S0 Bgvvleo7last 
Tuesday. On it, he strengthens his reputation as 
one of the most imaginative and popular contem
porary musical story-tellers.
As a collection of songs, bwS1'S0 Bgvvleo is just a 
little less exciting than Stings early solo work, in 
particular, his second solo album, 1987s *n9Uleo 
vliw 9Uw M'et But this may be largely due to an 
overall change in Stings sound. His work with 
Andy Summers and Stewart Copeland in The Po
lice was heavily influenced by reggae sounds  
their songs often stressed the up-beat and had 
lively, energetic rhythms. These influences car
ried over into Stings early solo 
work.
They were particularly evi
dent in 1985s TSwgC n4 9Uw 
!v'w .'S9vws and 1987s *n9U
leo zliw 9Uw M'e7 where he 
also started to experiment 
with unusual time signatures.
However, by the 1993 release 
of .we M'CCnewSks .gvws7 the 
reggae influence began to take 
a back seat to new sounds that 
were becoming prominent in 
Stings work.
This may be one reason why 
Sting marked his first decade 
as a solo artist a distinct pe
riod in his career with the re
lease of BlwvRs n4 ?nvR) .Uw !ws9 n4 M9leo7 q9VZq99Zt
Stings concept album, .Uw Mn'v dgows, may be 
the one exception to the reggae influence during 
this period, but as a concept album, it stands apart 
from the rest of his work anyway.
The sound Sting began to develop in .we 
M'CCnewSks .gvws was heavily influenced by in
strumental melodies from medieval England and 
American blues, gospel 
choirs, and country-inspired vocal melodies.
In his latest offering, the 
artist demonstrates, in 
songs like Let Your Soul 
Be Your Pilot, I was 
Brought to My Senses, 
Valparaiso, and Im so 
Happy I cant Stop Cry
ing, how such eclectic in
fluences can be success
fully integrated into one 
sound.'
The result is songs that 
dont make you want to 
shake your booty, (like 
most of Stings early solo 
work), as much as they make you want to sit down 
and contemplate the images being created.
You Still Touch Me and All Four Seasons are 
the only low points in bwS1'S0 Bgvvleot But even in 
these cases, it isnt so much that these two songs 
are bad  theyre just decidedly underwhelming.
In both cases, the vocal melodies are repetitive and 
the songs dont really go anywhere. These are the 
two tracks on the album youll never remember 
listening to.
One aspect of Stings song-writing that has been 
consistently excellent since his early days with The 
Police has been his lyrics. They are emotive an<J 
compelling, and somehow always manage to sto^) 
just short of sounding clich or contrived. Th 
eighth track on the new album, La Belle Dam 
Sans Regrets, (roughly, The Beautiful Lady with 
No Regrets) shows that this is true even when 
Sting writes in French.
While my inital reaction to hearing Sting sing
ing in French was somewhere between despair 
and suffocation, the song has quickly become 
one of my favorites on the album. In particular, 
I have come to appreciate the fact that he did not 
try to force an authentic accent  that would 
surely have sounded transparent.
If youre a Sting fan and you havent bought 
bwS1'S0 Bgvvleo yet, there is no reason to wait?,. 
If youre not a Sting fan but appreciate good song 
writing, wait for a nice sunny day and walk, 
dont run, down to the CD store after the nearest 
one, and pick up a copy of the mad Englishmans 
latest.

to have some deep, meaningful mo
ments with the characters so that all 
of this will end up meaning some
thing. And its here that A blR2le9wSks 
.gvw turns sour.
About halfway through the film, we 
suddenly find ourselves systematically 
introduced to a host of character coiflicts: a woman coming to terms with^a 
dead husband, an abandoned son* a 
romantic alcoholic ... the list goes on*. 
Everyone has his or her problem, and 
none of them is especially subtle; "at 
one point, Joe is on the verge of'a 
nervous breakdown and shouts at ev
eryone, What makes this fucking life 
worth living!?
A man with Branaghs talent and 
experience ought to know that, in 
drama, a character who wonders about 
this issue ought never to simply come 
out and sg0 it.
These personal conflicts  which 
are all somehow conveniently solved, 
by the way, when the show finally 
manages to go up  seem quite disL 
tinct from the films comedic aspects.. 
Its as though Branagh felt obligated 
to tack on the character stuff to give 
the comedy something to work off.'
The only character he seems to care 
about (and therefore the only one 2w 
truly Care about) is Joe himself, who, 
near the end of the film, is offered a 
three-picture deal with a big movie 
studio.
If he wants it, he has to leave for 
California on the night GgCvw9 is sup
posed to open.
I wont get into what he decides, buj: 
I will say that it is entirely predictable 
and completely sentimental and over
wrought. ' '
While this film is not the total disas
ter we saw in BSgeiwes9wle7 it is very 
far from the best Branagh can do. u~ 
As a satirical theatre piece, it works'. 
But as the emotional, character-exploration piece it tries so hard to be, it 
flounders and finally sinks.
I suppose, what Branagh realty 
needs to ask himself is that age-old 
question, Whats my motivation? :
By ALEX LEWIN
.gS9ge M9g442Sl9wS
The films of Kenneth Branagh have 
followed a peculiar pattern in which 
quality has been inversely proportional 
to budget size. His first film, GweS0 :7 
shot on a shoestring budget in seven 
weeks time, was brilliant.
What: A Midwinter's Tale 
Director: Kenneth Branagh 
Company: Castle Rock
His fifth full-length film, bgS0 
MUwvvw0ks BSgeiwes9wle7 a lavish, bigbudget studio production, was truly 
detestable.
Therefore, I had high hopes for 8 
blR2le9wSks .gvw7 with its pittance of 
a budget, lack of big name stars, and 
theatrical (which is to say, of the the
atre) subject matter. Might this be a 
return to Branaghs humble roots? 
Might we once again see the Branagh 
of Hw9wSks BSlweRs and GweS0 :7 the 
latter film having stirred up compari
sons to Olivier?
Well, no. In fact, the film is fiercely 
disappointing.
A blR2le9wSks .gvw is about an outof-work actor, Joe (Michael Maloney), 
who manages to muster a tiny budget 
in order to mount a production of GgC
vw9 in a rural church. He only has a 
handful of actors (including himself in 
the lead role), one tech person, and 
one designer  and an eleven-day re
hearsal period.
Its a great comic premise and there 
are some big laughs, thanks in part to 
Neil Farrells rapid cutting, which very 
often takes a kind-of-humorous line 
and imposes a terse comic timing on it 
that makes it a slap-your-knee-funny 
line.
But Branagh, who wrote and directed 
the film, knows he cant amuse us for 
100 minutes with backstage shenani
gans and eccentric auditions. We have

Art focuses on color, technology
By WILL WOOD
.g9Sge h'elnS M9g442Sl9wS
Being at Carnegie Mellon has 
strange effects on the student body in 
general. This is no less the case with 
the art students. On one side of the 
campus we have the heirs to the tech

 students have em

in their artistic 
lives, and often to 
some good effect. Scott Morris, while 
employing video and electronics in a 
few of his pieces, stuns us most with 
something that would seem quite dated 
by the standards of our campus: his 
obvious skill in drawing. One wall of 
the gallery is covered with small, pre

models, self portraiture, and old mas

Peppers lack spice
By BRADLEY W. ZIMMERMAN
.gS9ge M9g442Sl9wS
There are a few things you should 
know about the Civic Arena. The Ig
loo, as locals affectionately call it, is 
(1) friggin huge, (2) has a ten-foot gap 
for the security guards between the 
stage and the audience, and (3) is the 
most commercially accessible venue 
in the burgh.
The Chili Peppers should never have 
signed on for this show. I dont care if 
they have now reached superstar status 
and have no choice but to play bigger 
venues, they are the quintessential Club 
band. They rely so heavily on the kinetic 
bond they share with the audience that 
at the older shows, the entire club be
came a swirling, throbbing entity of 
sweat-soaked bodies slamming, grind
ing, dancing, and diving, the band itself 
a blur of adrenalized motion, second 
only to the whirling dervish of Janes 
Addiction in their heyday.
However, diversification of the crowd 
is one of the prices you must pay for 
increased popularity, and on Thursday 
the number of mall chicks, parents, sit
ters, dregs, those who light up their Bics 
during the slow song, and the rest of 
their folded-arm brethren nearly out
numbered the sweaty swarm on the 
floor.
Lets discuss the opening bands, who 
mustve been picked because they are 
on related record labels: Spacehog and 
the Toadies.
The only thing Spacehog had going 
for them was the fact that they were 
British. I am thoroughly convinced that 
the extras from .Uls Ls MNlegv .gN got 
jealous and started their own band, and 
that I was being forced to sit through
their cheesy 70s arena-rock aesthetic:
My God, I cant think of a suitable way 
to describe how much they sucked. The 
low end was muddy as hell, even for the 
infamous acoustics of The Igloo, they 
drew out the cadenzas of each and every, 
one of their songs, coaxed the audience 
into the tried-and-true fuck you chant, 
and performed enough self-indulgent 
solos to make me sure they would break 
into Peter Framptons Do You Feel Likjl 
We Do.
They were annoyingly goofy  not 
amusingly so  and even had the auidacity to walk off the stage to the sound's 
of the U.K.s anthem, God Save the 
Queen, which Queen themselves were 
knownfor. Spacehogisherebytheworst 
band Ive had the misfortune to be alive 
for (I just missed the Bay City Rollers).
I dont like the Toadies and their brand 
of, face it, grunge, but they put on one 
hell of a show. No costumes, no bullshit, 
just pure conviction in their music, and 
they played it as loudly and as power
fully as they could, professionals to the 
e9U power. Their sound quality was 
clear as hell, and you simply had to 
respect them, they almost looked to be in 
pain as they played. Of course everyone 
stood and sang along with their token 
radio hit (to which some guy next to me 
was actually headbangingand rather 
violently so), but it was the assortment 
of covers that they played, such as ttji 
punked-up version of the early 80?: 
cheesy synth-pop song Cars which 
stole the show.
Minor fear set in before the Chilis 
even started playing when I noticed ;

lights being lowered from the ceiling to

Noisy Indie band shows potential
: By DAVT5 ELMAN
.gS9ge M9g442Sl9wS
: From the moment that little
red CD laser hit Tno wgSs7 I 
knew O-Matic to be what they 
were  the typical indie/punk 
band.
Who: O-Matic 
What: Dog Years 
Label: Grass Records
 They are noisy and seem to put 
 little or no planning into their 
"song structures. Nevertheless, 
they make this work to some ex
tent, as the songs are catchy, and 
 I found them stuck in my head. 
The album is rather unpolished, 
but the band has potential.
O-Matic uses two vocalists who 
trade off between 
songs. In fact,
Michelle and Scott 
Bodine are siblings.
Of the two, Michelle 
is better than Scott, 
lie is whiny and an
noying, while she is 
better, although it 
sometimes sounds 
like shes bored and 
wants to be done as 
soon as possible. I 
'can imagine her 
'"singing with a sneer 
through several of 
the songs, taunting 
! the bands audience.
The lead song of the album, 
Slow Ass Cadillac, is probably 
the albums best. It sets the pace 
for the remaining songs  gui
tars imparting speed to a thun
dering drum backdrop. The over
all effect briefly reminds of the 
Ramones I Want to be Sedated, 
but this gives way to a non-stop 
noisier parallel. The clarity ofthe 
vocals balances the musics speed. 
The song itself is a rant about a 
bad driver, which seems like the 
band recorded an aggravated 
driving session and then 
smoothed everything over so it 
made a good song lyric.
The third track, Come to Find 
Out, introduces us to Scotts 
style. He sounds a bit like the 
singer of Blood Circus, an old 
band from Seattle. Although his 
slightly tremolo delivery is inter
esting, the song is forgettable, 
X
all the other tracks. After a 
while, I couldnt remember 
which was which because they 
all seem the same.
The rest of the tracks are all 
similar to the aforementioned. 
Unsaid is a promising song ru
ined by Scott. He really cant sing; 
he just talks loudly over every- l 
thing at a brisk pace. We seem 
destined for a change of atmo
sphere on Prize Pig when our 
ears are met by strumming gui
tars that form a melody, but this 
is not to be. Soon things speed up 
considerably and the sound dete
riorates into the din of noise that 
is characteristic of the album. 
Scott returns on Numb, where 
he sings, its so annoying ... its 
made me numb, which I found 
rather ironic because this was 
my reaction to him.
Big Kiss is the big surprise 
of the album, and it 
hints at how good 
they could be if they 
tried. The guitar is 
pulled into a cohe
sive whole from its 
usually threadbare 
state, and there are 
even lyrics like, all 
Im going to say is 
that you better 
make it better or 
Im gonna leave or I 
kick your ass. 
Overall, the album 
is quite ordinary, al-Courtesy of Grass Records , , . , . ..
The singers in Omatic, Michell and Scott Bodine, are a though it certainly 
One good thing brother and sister duo with varying vocal styles. isnt the worst thing
 about O-Matic is 
that they never let anything get

and I really didnt care what it 
was about. Not Yours to Lose is 
a track about a possessive lover. 
In the spirit of Slow Ass Cadillac 
it is another angry rant, but this 
time its a bit slower. The music 
still retains O-Matics traditional 
noisy and melodic mix, however,

icles the tempest-tossed love 
between Amalia Balash (senior 
drama major Julia Haubner) 
and Georg Nowak (senior 
drama major David Miceli). 
Both are members of a lonely 
hearts club in which they cor
respond with other eligible 
singles. It just so happens that 
Amalia and Georg, who work 
together in real life at 
Maraczeks Perfumery, grow 
to love each other in the anony
mous letters they exchange but 
hate each other in the work
place. Meanwhile, back at the 
ranch, another employee, the 
slimy Steven Kodaly (senior 
drama major Peter Humer) is 
seeing the wife of the store 
owner, Mr. Maraczek (senior 
drama major Marcus Chait). 
Well, rumors go flying and soon 
Georg is fired when Mr.
lems ....
Overall, the plot is simple lovestory fare of the star-crossed type.
However, as can be expected, 
this movie does not end on a pair 
of suicides. Instead, it ends on a 
nice dance number with the en
semble appearing on stage for one 
last lick at the score.
As sickly sweet as the story 
sounds, lauds must go to the pro
duction and acting team that 
turned a corny musical into a dy
namic andfun performance. Guest 
Director Stephen Kanne led his 
troupe in a campy romp through 
various comical mannerisms and 
quirks that gave life to cardboard 
characters. This camp was aug
mented by the expert choreogra
phy of Judith Ann Conte. How
ever, the ultimate in high cheese 
was the schticky but incredibly 
apt and well made scenery, designed by Craig Choma, a gradu- ; 
ate drama student, and built by 
Kevin Broom ell, a sophmore 
drama student.
The acting, as well, was quite 
nice. Micelis portrayal of Georg 
was heartfelt and kind. Chaif s 
metamorphosis from a skinny col-, 
lege kid to a doddering and wellgroomed old man was amazing. 
Finally, Haubner, as Amelia, 
stole the show with a wry wit 
and teenagers charm. Like 
high school actors with a lot 
of practice and better voices, 
the cast had fun putting on 
this production.
MUw znPws bw is a musical 
grounded in the traditional 
of Rogers and Hammerstien 
with a conversational style 
that predates Sondhiem by 
about ten years. The music 
was whimsical and fun, and 
the settings were varied and 
never boring. But, as musicals of 
this sort tend to be, MUw znPws bw 
is mind-candy. It is fun. It is excit
ing. It will make you happy. And, 
like high school drama, it is de
signed to showcase the talents of 
a series of very talented students. 
Just think of it as going back to 
your roots. It will help in swallow
ing down the gooey story, giving 
you leave to just take in the flm.

movies you may have seen before....
By JOHN BIGGS
Thursday, March 28
Metropolis
This movie doesnt have any words throughout 
the whole thing. It is called a silent film and is 
supposed to be artsy. It was made in 1926 in 
Germany, so not only is it silent, its in another 
language.
This is the first science fiction movie, pretty 
much. Its about a guy with a cushy job who 
abandons it all to join a bunch of hippie workers 
who revolt against the system. Whats really neat 
is there is this big silver-looking robot creature 
that shows up halfway through, so that should 
impress the pants off you, provided youre wear
ing a pair.
As The Police once said, Tour brothers going to 
kill me and hes six feet ten. Thats good advice for 
anybody, especially Laurens Mom.
At 6, 8,10 pm, and midnight.
Friday, March 29
Heat
There are a number of good Italian actors: A1 
Pacino, Lou Ferrigno, Tony Danza, Pat Morita, 
Elvis Costello, Margaret Mead, Sally Struthers, 
that guy in Cheers, your grandpa, Anthony Michael 
Hall, Selina, Michael Jackson-o, and Paul Anka. 
However, only one of them is in this movie, and I 
think its A1 Pacino. If it isnt, then its Robert 
DeNiro. Dont quote me on that, though.
Heat is an action thriller with blood and guts and 
gun-fire, and I bet no one is wearing long under
wear in this film. Featuring the talents of a bunch 
of action-related guys, this one is the king of 
modern action^dramad-icomedy. Anyway, this is 
in the same vein as Pulp Fiction and Kiss Me 
Because Im Silly.
As The Police once said, Every little thing she 
do is magic magic magic. Thats true of many 
people, especially The Amazing Kreskin.
. At 5, 8:30 pm, and midnight.
Saturday, March 30
Braveheart
Avast ye lads and lassies! Top othe morning to 
you, ye wee bairns! Anyway, this one is set in 
Scotland and is a real humdinger.
Mel Gibson plays this weirdo hippie in animal 
furs who avenges his wifes death. Theres some 
crazy stuff going on in this one, as well as a lot of 
jumping and running and killing and macrame. 
While this movie is no The Son ofFlubber, its in 
English and there are lots of happy looking little 
hills and horses and stuff.
What else? Well, theres lots of other good stuff 
going on, but the things are too numerous to 
mention. But as The Police once said, I will listen 
hard to your tuition. Thats deep in any accent.
At 4, 7,10 pm, and 1 am.

Star Trek TV Episode
Ummmmmmm... Hes dead, Jim! Dammit, Jim, 
Im a doctor, not a bricklayer! Ummmmm... Highly 
illogical! Warp factor ten!
Ummmmmmmmmm... Klingons. Those little 
furry things. Captain Kirks butt. Elvis.
Lets see... Uhura! That one Russian guy! The 
one where everybody goes back into time and 
hangs out in New York and have to stop the 
Worlds Fair or some jive.
Anyway, thats all I could think of. Thats pretty 
much what Star Trek is about, so you run with 
that, big guy.
At 6, 8,10 pm, and midnight.
CMU supplies Chili Peppers tickets
IRIIRmg vUnS GT$
ambiance. The real fear set in 
when I noticed they were about to 
indulge in one of the luxuries of 
bloated arena rock acts  backup 
singers.
Their latest album, Wew Gn9 
ble'9w7 easily their best in the 
past few years highlights new 
guitarist Dave Navarro (formerly 
of Janes Addiction), who has fi
nally pulled out the bands collec
tive nosedive into strict funk and 
back into almost experimental 
punkfunk.
Still not the types to stick to 
conventional set lists, the Chilis 
simply walked out on stage 
without any fanfare and opened 
the show with an extended 
improv and then taking it into 
one of their almost-hits, Suck 
My Kiss. However, it was al
ready apparent that with the 
exception of the sneering com
posure of Navarro, the band was 
not yet accustomed to the large 
stage and long-distance audi
ence. The sound itself was a
serious issue  for some reason 
it seemed that all that was com
ing through the PA system was 
midrange, and the quality 
changed throughout the night. 
However, the early part of the 
set did have some high points, 
such as the terminally vapid 
Aeroplane being given new life 
by a dirty guitar tone and more 
aggressive playing on the whole.
What else? A bunch diddling 
around on Velvet Underground 
material (the band had hung 
out at the Andy Warhol Mu
seum all day) between songs, 
an old classic Backwoods 
which almost died in the middle 
section due to the PA, and of 
course happy feel-good bonding 
to the big single My Friends. 
Ho hum. Then vocalist Anthony 
Kiedis tripped and fell off the 
stage.
Strangely, the show was in
credible after that. Bassist Flea 
acquired more energy, the 
sound was equalized, and An
thony basically went apeshit
with the new anklebrace, tear
ing through a frenzied Higher 
Ground, One Big Mob, and 
Coffee Shop. And yes, they 
played Under the Bridge, on 
which Navarro proved his 
mettle by playing it better than 
former guitarist John 
Frusciante.
Apparently the fall caused 
more damage to Kiedis than he 
thought. With the exception of 
Deep Kick and the ancient 
gem RHCP, they seemed to 
cut the show short and keep the 
encore to only two sorigs, Kiedis 
visibly limping the whole time. 
It was also apparent that they 
were not truly connecting with 
the audience from their stand
point, although I believe the 
show was cut short due to ankle, 
not audience. Also, with as ex
tensive a catalog as they have, 
they relied far too much on new 
material.
In terms of turnout, it was a 
successful show, though not a 
sell-out. However, Residence
Life supplied us with one of the 
coolest treats imaginable: re
duced price tickets through 
their Pittsburgh Horizons divifsion, which is dedicated to getf 
ting students out of the bubbly 
of the CMU campus and into 
the city of Pittsburgh for differ
ent events for some mucli 
needed R&R. Res Life and the 
Activities Board acquired 40 
tickets to the show, which were 
sold for ten dollars each aftey a 
campus-wide raffle was held; 
They even supplied a bus to and 
from the show for us (see, CMU 
really does care about its stuidents!!!)
Future activities sponsored 
by Horizons will include a trip 
to the Pittsburgh Ballet, a campl
ing trip, and hopefully a few 
Pirates games. They were also 
responsible for the past excjir'r 
sions to the Rock n Roll Hall of 
Fame, the John Williams (M9gS 
3gSs^7 Symphony, and the Live 
concert last year. Kudos to these 
campus organizations!Oscars honor Hollywoods greatest

ing performance categories is a 
bit more challenging. In the

the edge, mainly because she was

Needless to say, this years cer

most unusual in Oscar history.

work could increase his 
chances of winning, 
but the trophy is more 
likely to go to someone 
who is featured in a 
picture the Academy 
likes more than M's

ture contender.
On the surface 
James Cromwells per
formance as Farmer 
Hoggett in !gfw may 
seem the long shot in 
this category, but this 
is not the case. The only 
trophy !gfw is going to 
win next Monday is the 
Visual Effects award, 
and the Academy may 
want to recognize one 
of the most appealing movies of 
1995 by honoring its human star. 
The Oscar, however, will most 
likely go to Ed Harris for his role 
as flight director Gene Kranz in 
8Nnvvn qEt 8Nnvvn was the Best 
Picture favorite going into the 
nominations, but now its seems 
that it may lose in all nine of the 
categories in which it is nomi
nated. The Academy will certainly 
want to give the movie something, 
and Harris certainly did a com
mendable job in the role.
If Ron Howard were nominated 
for Best Director, he would prob
ably win the award, but since hes 
not, Mel Gibson will walk off with 
the trophy for !SgPwUwgS97 due 
largely to lack of competition.
Generally the movie that wins 
Best Director goes on to win the 
Best Picture Oscar, and that rule 
will apply this year as well. 8Nnvvn

add an Oscar to that collection 
next Monday evening.
The victor in Best Actress cat
egory is apparent as well. Nomi
nees Meryl Streep and Emma 
Thompson have won before 
(plus Thompson will win a 
statuette for her Mwesw geR Mwe
slflvl90 screenplay, and two 
awards in one night seems un
likely). Elisabeth Shue is too 
new and too young to win in the 
category, and Academy mem
bers best remember Sharon 
Stone for parting her legs in 
!gsl1 Les9le19t I dont see them 
getting the Oscar either. Susan 
Sarandon, on the other hand, 
has never won an Oscar before, 
despite five nominations. Fur

a nun who attempts to get a 
convicted murderer off death 
row in TwgR bge 3gvileot The
