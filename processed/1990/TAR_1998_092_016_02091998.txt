Authorities question Lewinsky regarding case
By ELLEN BELDNER
Tartan News Editor
After a short hiatus, the national 
news media was back on campus 
last weekend to cover Carnegie 
Mellons link to President Clintons 
alleged affair with White House in. tern Monica Lewinsky. This time, 
however, when reporters arrived at 
Phi Kappa Theta (Phi Kap) to ques
tion Mike Lewinsky, sophomore IM 
major and younger brother of 
Monica, they followed a more seri
ous story than a potential presiden
tial scandal.
A source who wished to remain 
anonymous confirmed that on Fri
day two investigators from the Fed
eral Bureau of Investigations ap
proached Phi Kap and interviewed 
Mike Lewinsky to see if he had any 
information regarding the events 
surrounding his sister and Presi
dent Clinton. The FBI agents were 
sent to question Lewinsky at the
behest of independent prosecutor 
Kenneth Starr, the attorney who is 
investigating accusations that 
Clinton had an affair with Monica 
Lewinsky, lied about the affair un
der oath, and urged her to lie under 
oath as well.
Starr, who has spent over $30 mil
lion in public tax monies investigat
ing the president, has been granted 
fall use of the FBIs resources during 
his investigation.
Along with the FBI agents, how
ever, came the media. According to 
a reporter for Pittsburghs Channel 
2 News, the Cable News Network 
(CNN)  the network that broke 
the news of investigators 
questioning Mike Lewinsky  
received information from an FBI 
contact that the FBI would be 
interviewing him.
The anonymous source also con
firmed that Associated Press (AP) 
reporter Anthony Breznican was at 
the fraternity house attempting to
question brothers. Breznican was 
the same AP reporter who had vis
ited Phi Kap three times when the 
story initially broke.
On Saturday, after CNN aired a 
segment on the FBIs visit to Phi 
Kap, Channel 2 News received a tip 
that FBI agents would be returning 
to the fraternity at 6 pm. The sta
tion sent a news van to wait near 
the fraternity house. The van was 
parked on Devon Street, which runs 
behind the fraternity quad, from at 
least 5:45 pm until 6:45 pm. How
ever, FBI investigators did not re
turn to the house.
Don Hale, vice president of Uni
versity relations, commented that 
he could neither confirm nor deny 
the truth of any any events that had 
occurred since his office is not noti
fied of every event that occurs.
Both the fraternity and Mike 
Lewinsky are continuing their no
comment policy about the situation 
to any segment of the media.Cohon gives environmental lecture
By MICHELLE HAN
Tartan Staffwriter
Tackling an area of personal 
interest arid research, CMU 
president Jared L. Cohon dis
cussed his ideas in a lecture en
titled Sustainable Develop
ment:^ Decision-Making Prob
lem. A near-capacity crowd at
tended the event, which was held 
in McConomy auditorium last 
Monday. The talk, hosted by the 
Environmental Institute at 
CMU, was the second lecture in 
the 1997-98 distinguished lec
ture series. In attendence were 
faculty, students, and staff, in 
addition to audience members 
from the University of Pittsburgh 
and Duquesne University.
Cohon, who holds a PhD in 
civil engineering from the 
Massachusetts Institute of 
Techonology, is an internation
ally recognized expert in water 
resources planning and environ
mental decision-making. Ive al
ways been intrigued by the idea 
of sustainable development as a 
decision-making problem.
When he was asked to give a 
talk last fall, Cohon recalled that 
at the time he said, Im gonna 
think hard and see if I can come
up with something useful to say 
about [this.]
Cohon first presented the au
dience with a brief outline of his 
lecture, which consisted of five 
parts: a definition of sustainable 
development, thinking about the 
environment, trends, making 
sustainability useful, and look
ing at a case study.
He spent a substantial portion 
of the lecture developing the
another ecologist, he said, 
Humanitys dominace of earth 
means that we cannot escape 
responsibility for managing 
the planet.
He further said that manag
ing the planet, finding 
sustainability, and knowing 
when youve achieved it re
quires articulating judgments. 
Sustainability is the mother of 
all objective problems, he said
"The talk had one of its intended 
effects  to stimulate thinking and 
promote discussion.

background and context of sus
tainable development before 
talking about it as a decision
making problem. This is a multi
policy, multi-criteria, systemsanalytic, decision-making prob
lem under uncertainty, he said.
Toward the end of his speech, 
Cohon raised the question he 
introduced as the one humans 
have struggled with ever since 
being human: What is our rela
tionship to nature? Quoting
about the species value in rela
tion to human beings.
Having served as a legislative 
assistant for New York senator 
Daniel P. Moynihan in 1977-78, 
Cohon also talked about the need 
for discussion about important 
issues in decision-making policy. 
It amazes me that the senators 
spend two hours talking about 
thermostat regulations, he said 
in his talk. They never talk 
about things that really matter,
like should the U.S. have its own
oil reserves overseas. They talk 
about thermostats.
Cohon said that he was pleased 
with the strong questions that 
were asked at the end of his 
lecture, such as Would you drain 
the last barrel of oil, believing 
that technology will come along 
to save the day?
I welcome that kind of strong 
questioning. Its very typical of 
CMU, said Cohon. The talkhad 
one of its intended effects  to 
stimulate thinking and promote 
discussion.
Cohon said that he received 
positive feedback from the audi
ence during the reception that 
followed as well as during the 
week through email. I was real 
pleased. I was glad that I did it, 
Cohon said. It was a great turn
out. Ive been to other environ
mental discussions and this was 
more than I expected.
Indira Nair, professor of engi
neering and public policy, said 
president Cohon wrestled with 
the ideas he would present in his 
talk without simply giving the 
same lecture under a different 
title. Sustainability is very 
hard, she said. This is not an

Britain supports U.S. against Iraq
WASHINGTON (AP)  Speakingfrom 
the room where predecessors plotted 
World War II, President Clinton and 
British Prime Minister Tony Blair re
doubled warnings of military retaliation 
against Iraq. We will again prevail, 
Clinton declared Saturday.
Separately, German Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl lined up behind any U.S.- 
led military action should diplomatic 
efforts fail to force Iraqi President 
Saddam Hussein to comply with United 
Nations resolutions requiring him to 
pen all potential weapons-production 
sites to international inspectors.
Blair , in Washington for official meet
ings with Clinton and Congress, said no 
issue has been more pressing in those 
discussions than Saddams defiance.
This is a man who has already com
piled sufficient chemical and biological 
Weapons to wipe out the worlds popula
tion.... He must be stopped, Blair said. 
If diplomacy fails and force is the only 
jvay to get him into line, then force will 
be used.
^ was a theme Clinton and Blair 
sounded throughout the prime ministers
visit. Blair joined Clinton in his weekly 
radio address, taped Friday night in the 
White House Map Room before the lead
ers and their wives flew by helicopter to 
the Camp David presidential retreat in 
the Catoctin Mountains of Maryland.
Clinton, speaking first, noted that the 
Map Room was where, more than 50 
years earlier, President Franklin D. 
Roosevelt and Prime Minister Winston 
Churchill charted their joint strategy 
for victory in World War II.
Throughout the 20th century, the 
alliance between the United States and 
Britain made all the difference between 
tyranny and freedom, chaos and secu
rity, Clinton said. Now we are turn
ing to face the challenges of a new 
century. And together, we will again 
prevail.
Both leaders pronounced U.S.-British 
ties unshakable. And while Clintons 
last-resort plan for military strikes on 
Iraq is sharply opposed by Russia, 
France, China, and other countries, Blair 
assured Clinton on Saturday: I stand 
foursquare with you in our determina
tion to bring Saddam into line.
Kohl, meeting with Defense Secretary 
William Cohen and a U.S. Senate del
egation in Munich, Germany, said the 
United States has the full support of 
its European partners and may use Ger
man bases in any necessary military 
operation.
In another gesture of solidarity, eight 
British ground-attack and reconnais
sance aircraft were to be sent to Iraqs 
neighboring Kuwait in the coming days.
Cohen, meanwhile, said Saturday that 
one of the United States three aircraft 
carriers in the Persian Gulf would be 
brought home. Pentagon officials main
tain that two carriers are adequate to 
support a sustained bombing campaign.
If that happens, Britain will be there, 
as we have been in the past, Blair said.
The taping of Saturdays five-minute 
radio address came near the end of Blairs 
four-day visit to Washington, his first 
since his election as prime minister last 
May. The Blairs flew home Saturday.
South African President Nelson 
Mandela is the only other foreign leader 
with whom Clinton has shared his 
weekly radio bioadcast.

French fear Corsican 
violence will increase
PARIS (AP) - The killing of 
Corsicas top official was the strongest 
blow yet to Frances government on 
the Mediterranean island, and people 
feared Saturday that the violence 
would only intensify.
No group has claimed responsibility 
for Fridays shooting of Claude 
Erignac, the first regional prefect to be 
killed in Corsica, but suspicion fell on 
separatists, who have waged a 23- 
year battle for greater autonomy. In 
Paris, two influential newspapers de
scribed the killing as an apparent dec
laration of war.
Erignac, 60, was shot four times in the 
head as he walked to a classical music 
concert in Ajaccio. Two gunmen fled on 
motorcycles. Two suspects were being 
held for questioning, sources close to the 
investigation said Saturday. Their iden
tities were not released. Residents of 
Ajaccio, Corsicas de facto capital, began 
filing past the prefecture late Saturday. 
Many left wreaths and signed condo
lence books next to the gates.
Citizens. Wake up, one message 
said. Another read: By killing our 
prefect, theyve tried to kill- the 
Corsican soul.
Until now, France could afford to 
consider the separatists on its Mediter
ranean island a bearable irritant. Their 
hallmark was bombings that targeted 
strategic sites without shedding blood. 
If Erignacs killing was ordered by sepa
ratists, it would pose a clear challenge 
to Frances highly centralized govern
ment barely a month away from March 
15 regional elections.
An anti-terrorism squad in Paris 
was leading the investigation. A pistol 
used in the attack was . found by 
Erignacs body. Judicial sources, 
speaking on condition of anonymity, 
said the pistol may have been stolen 
during a September raid on a police 
 station in southern Corsica.
French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin 
went to Corsica on Saturday in re
sponse to the killing, which he called 
an act of cowardice. The culprits 
and eventually the sponsors of this act
will be found, handed over to the courts 
and punished, Jospin told reporters 
after meeting with police.
Interior Minister Jean-Pierre 
Chevenement, who also arrived in 
Corsica on Saturday, said the island 
faced a barbaric regression into vio
lence if the crime went unsolved. He 
urged all residents of Corsica to aid 
the official investigation, because the 
future of Corsica is at stake.
President Jacques Chirac, speaking 
in Paris, said he was determined ev
erything be done so that the authority 
of the state is respected.
Under the headline of Irreparable, 
the Le Monde newspaper said in an 
editorial that the killing of Erignac, 
appointed by the president, was a 
message which appears to be a decla
ration of war.
The left-wing Liberation daily spoke 
in the same terms. Le Monde said the 
attack appeared to have been plotted 
by people wanting to lead the islands 
youth to an extremism aimed at con
vincing mainland France of the need 
to abandon the island. French media 
speculated on a possible motive of frus
tration among a divided array of 
Corsican nationalist groups. The 
groups are thought to have little chance 
of winning seats in next months elec
tion for Corsicas regional assembly.
Corsican militants announced an 
end to their 7-month-old truce in Janu
ary, saying Frances leftist govern
ment has failed to meet their demands. 
Among those demands are an official 
recognition of the Corsican people and 
more aid for the impoverished island 
of about 250,000 people.
The nationalist movement began 
with an uprising in 1975 at a wine 
cellar in Aleria, on the eastern coast.
In 1996, a faction of the Front for 
the National Liberation of Corsica lev
eled a new France Telecom building in 
Ajaccio with 200 pounds of explosives. 
Separatists also have targeted 
mainland France, bombing the 
Bordeaux city hall and a post office in 
Aix-en-Provence.
Prankster attacks 
Microsoft CEO
BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - 
Microsofts Bill Gates was creamed with 
something more hard-hitting than sub
poenas or lawsuits on Wednesday: a 
faceful of pie.
The chairman of the worlds most pow
erful software maker was arriving for a 
meeting with Belgian business and gov
ernment leaders when a prankster 
smacked his face with cream pie.
With cream dripping on the shoulders 
of his business suit and covering the 
lenses of his glasses, Gates was led into 
a side room to clean up. He later emerged, 
looking somewhat embarrassed.
He then met with Luc van den Brande, 
the . prime minister of Flanders, 
Belgiums Dutch-speaking northern half.
Police arrested two people, one of 
whom reportedly had distracted Gates 
while the other made his attack. 
Microsoft said it confirmed the cream 
pie was thrown by Noel Godin, a Bel
gian prankster who has struck at fa
mous people before.
Bill was obviously surprised by it, 
but he handled it with some grace, 
Microsoft spokeswoman Erin Brewer 
said from the companys Redmond, 
Wash, headquarters. He commented 
that one of the worst things about this 
whole thing was that the pie wasnt 
that tasty.
Germans debate 
memorial plans
BERLIN (AP)  Author Gunter Grass 
and other prominent German intellec
tuals are pressing the government to 
scrap plans for a national Holocaust 
memorial, adding fire to an already con
troversial project.
In an open letter to Chancellor Helmut 
Kohl, published in newspapers Wednes
day, the group of 19 said a stadium-sized 
memorial in the center of Berlin was an 
inappropriate way to remember Jews 
killed by the Nazis.
Calling the size oppressive, the group 
said such a memorial would not inspire 
quiet mourning and remembrance, or 
warning or enlightenment.
Abandoning the project on the 
grounds of common sense would honor 
all those involved, said the group, which
includes historian Juergen Kocka and 
Berlin Academy of Arts president 
Gyoergy Konrad.
The letter comes weeks before the me
morial committee is to choose a de
sign  the second round of designs con
sidered in the past five years. Kohl dis
missed the first design three years ago.
His dismissal reignited debate over 
the monument  its size, its location, its 
purpose, and even if it should exist. 
Despite detractors, the memorial com
mittee pushed ahead with a second de
sign competition, and a winner will be 
announced in mid-March.
Kohls office had no immediate reac
tion to the letter.
Hong Kong ends 
ban on chicken
HONG KONG (AP) - Truckloads of 
clucking Chinese chickens in orange 
plastic crates crossed into Hong Kong on 
Saturday, ending a six-week ban im
posed to contain a deadly bird flu epi
demic among Hong Kongs people.
Health officials wearing white smocks 
and surgical masks were waiting to in
spect the birds, which had been kept in 
a five-day quarantine in China to ensure 
they were free from the H5N1 virus, 
which killed six people before the out
break subsided.
Health workers conducted random 
blood tests among the 35,000 chickens 
at the Mankam To border checkpoint 
before the fowl were transported to a 
wholesale poultry market. The chick
ens, to be sold Sunday, all tested nega
tive for the bird flu virus.
Before the ban was imposed on De
cember 24, Hong Kong imported 80,000 
birds daily, or 75 percent of the territorys 
daily consumption, from China.
While many in Hong Kong accepted 
the need for the ban, it deprived fami
lies of traditional chicken dishes dur
ing the Chinese New Year festivities 
late last month.
The lifting of the ban comes after the 
Hong Kong government slaughtered all 
the territorys 1.4 million chickens late 
December in a drastic move to stamp out 
the virus outbreak that claimed its first 
human life last May.
The outbreak was a major test for the 
new government that took power when 
Hong Kong reverted to Chinese rule last 
July 1. Critics accused it of reacting too 
slowly and haphazardly to the crisis.
While government officials are confi
dent that the flu has been contained 
some expect consumers to remain wary. 
Many people will adopt a wait-and-see 
attitude toward chickens and even eggs. 
And who can blame them? the Hong 
Kong Standard said in an editorial.
Of the 18 people sickened by the bird 
flu, only two remained hospitalized 
with one listed in poor condition. No 
new flu cases have been reported since 
the chicken slaughter, but Lessie Wei 
head of the governments agriculture 
and fisheries department, said the flus 
legacy lived on in the stringent new 
tests that will cost Hong Kong $1.92 
million a year.
A World Health Organization team 
last month found no sign of the bird flu 
in southern China, but said more sur
veillance was needed. The virus is car
ried by wild birds, which pass it to 
domestic fowl. There is no vaccine for 
the virus, and medical experts dont 
know how it is transmitted to humans. 
Health officials have not entirely ruled 
out a resurgence of the virus, but say 
the chances are good for now that it has 
been beaten.
Judge imprisons 
statutory rapist
SEATTLE (AP)  A judge had little 
choice but to reinstate a prison sentence 
for the former grade school teacher who 
had sex with a 13-year-old boy and gave 
birth to his baby.
Mary Kay LeTourneau, 35, was sent 
back to prison for nearly seven and a 
half years Friday after she and the boy 
were caught apparently trying to run 
away together.
The couple were found Tuesday in a 
parked car with the windows steamed 
up. The boy told detectives there had 
been no sexual contact. The two were 
found fully clothed. Prosecutors said they 
had $6,200 in cash, mens and infants 
clothing, and her passport.
LeTourneau had-been released from 
jail just a month earlier, on the condition 
that she stay away from the boy, now 14.
On Friday, prosecutors told the judge 
that LeTourneau apparently had met 
with the boy on other occasions after she 
was released from jail and that they may 
have been preparing to run away  
perhaps with their 9-month-old baby, 
who is being raised by the 14-year-old 
boys mother.Japanese tradition merges with technology at opening ceremonies
NAGANO, Japan (AP) - Cel
ebrating ancient traditions and 
the technological revolution it 
helped pioneer, Japan opened the 
Winter Olympics Friday by show
casing itself  from jumbo sumo 
wrestlers to tiny singing children, 
mystical mountain rites to a dra
matic display of musicmakingthat 
joined five continents in song.
Skater Midori Ito, a national 
heroine with tears streaming 
down her face, ignited the Olym
pic flame in a windswept valley of 
the Japanese Alps. With that, the 
18th Winter Games  the last of 
the century  were inaugurated 
in an adept mixture of local and 
global that touched the Earths
every comer but kept pointing 
right back to Nagano.
Athletes from 72 nations and 
regions marched into a cherry 
blossom-shaped stadium built es
pecially for these games. Chil
dren sang of hope and peace. And, 
in a striking ceremony, a parade 
of sumo wrestlers marched qui
etly onto the dais, chests bare in 
the winter air. Leading them: 
Akebono, Japans grand sumo 
was champion, or yokozuna, who
 in his loincloth, without even a 
shiver  performed a painstak
ing ritual designed to cast away 
evil spirits.
Emperor Akihito and Empress 
Michiko applauded enthusiasti
cally as more than 2,400 athletes
 the most ever for a Winter 
Olympics  paraded past their 
box. The athletes will compete 
during the next two weeks in 14 
sports in Nagano and the moun
tains that encircle it. Some na
tions, like the United States, have 
dozens of athletes; others like Iran 
and Belgium have only one.
They strode into the Minami 
Nagano sports park trium
phantly, each group led by an 
athlete carrying its national flag, 
each nation escorted by a Japa
nese sumo champion and a child 
from the Nagano area. The 
50,000-strong crowds applause 
rose when the U.S. team marched
in, wearing long slate-blue par
kas and dark brimmed hats  a 
good buffer for the 34-degree 
weather. Some of them wore tiny 
American flags in buttonholes 
and hatbands. Its.just so excit
ing, figure skater Tara Lipinski 
said, smiling. I hope I can re
member it forever.
Technologys legacy to the 20th 
century shone as it showcased a 
work composed before electricity 
was harnessed  Ode to Joy 
from the Ninth Symphony of 
Beethoven, who couldnt hear the 
music he wrote. Today, 171 years 
after he died, hundreds of mil
lions of people across the world 
heard it all at once.
A system tailored to eliminate 
the moments-long delay typical of 
conventional satellite transmis
sions allowed Boston Symphony 
Orchestra conductor Seiji Ozawa 
to lead, from Nagano, a real-time, 
cross-continental performance of 
choirs in New York, Beijing, 
Sydney, Berlin, and the shores of 
South Africa.
Appropriately, much of the open
ing of these games was like this  
a blend of Asian classical and glo
bal modem. A 17th-century bell 
tolled at Naganos Zenko-ji temple. 
Traditional Japanese music 
melted into an Andrew Lloyd 
Webber composition performed by 
Naganos children.
Security was tightened around 
Nagano earlier this week after a 
terrorist attack on Tokyos inter
national airport. And in Washing
ton, President Clinton mulled 
whether to use military force on 
Iraq  an option that Interna
tional Olympic Committee Chair
man Juan Antonio Samaranchimplored him to avoid while the 
games are in session.
The emperor, the son of a man 
who for many symbolized Japans 
20th-century war machine, joined 
the call to end global conflict by 
pronouncing the games open from 
his imperial box. Then, smiling, 
the emperor gave the crowd a 
slight bow.

From National Weather Service bulletins and other sources
50 YEARS AGO, January 20, 
1948  The Carnegie Trustees 
approved a tuition increase for 
night students, effective for Fall 
1949. Tuition for the Engineering 
and Art colleges skyrocketed to 
$5.60 per unit, and General Sub
jects and the Margaret Morrison 
Carnegie School for Women , saw 
their units price increase to $4.80. 
Day students tuition remained 
around $6 per unit.
25 YEARS AGO, January 29, 
1973  Lieutenant Colonel An
thony B. Herbert, the former com
mander of the highest-ranked U.S. 
battalion in Vietnam, addressed 
Carnegie Mellon and Pitt students 
about the atrocities committed by 
the U.S. forces during the Viet
nam War. Herbert said that the 
torture of more than 500,000 civil
ians was sanctioned by the high
est level of U.S. military control.
At the end of the talk, the fa
ther of Allison Kraus  who was 
one of the students killed by the 
National Guard at a Kent State 
anti-war protest  urged the stu
dent audience to continue to op
pose the war and the trend of 
militarism in American govern
ment. After trying to bring 
charges of covering up the atroci
ties against his superior officers 
in 1971, Herbert was discharged; 
his subsequent bookSoZcZier docu
mented the war crimes.
10 YEARS AGO, February 2, 
1988Bobby Seale, co-founder of 
the Black Panther Party, ad
dressed a large crowd of students 
on his partys struggle for civil 
rights. He reflected on his own 
political development in the Civil 
Rights Movement, and explained 
the evolution of his partys ideol
ogy, focusing not only on political
equality, but on social equality as 
well, in areas of housing, employ
ment, and living standards.
After resisting the numerous 
racist attacks by police on people 
around the country in the race 
riots of the 1960s, the Black Pan
thers came to symbolize resis
tance to police brutality.
FIVE YEARS AGO, February 
1, 1993  Eric Grotzinger was 
appointed to the newly-created 
position of associate dean for un
dergraduate affairs in Mellon Col
lege of Science. In this position, 
he was responsible for all biology, 
chemistry, physics, and math 
undergraduates, as well as com
puter science freshmen. The Task 
Force for Undergraduate Advis
ing recommended this position to 
help MCS undergraduates fulfill 
the requirements of the recently 
expanded curriculum.
ONE YEAR AGO, February 
10, 1997  Student Affairs, AB 
Films, and SDC Films finalized a 
proposal to install a 35 millime
ter film projector and a Dolby 
Digital sound system in 
McConomy Auditorium. Original 
plans intended for McConomy to 
have the advanced projection sys
tem, but budget cuts forced the 
installation of a 16 millimeter 
projector and a mono sound sys
tem. The proposal estimated the 
cost of upgrading at $45,000. Ul
tra Tech, a company that installs 
cinematic projection and sound 
systems, and Pro Comm were 
hired to install the new systems 
over spring break. The revamped 
system produced the highest 
sound and picture quality in the 
Oakland area.

Crime and Incident Report
1/31 VANDALISM,1:24 pm - 
A complainant from a fraternity 
contacted Campus Police. Dur
ing the night, he said, someone 
had let the air out of the tires of 
two of his brothers vehicles, 
rendering them temporarily 
undrivable.
Aside from the deflated tires, 
there was no other apparent dam
age to the cars. The incident oc
curred on pledge night, leading 
the police to believe that it may 
have been a prank.
2/1 CRIMINAL MISCHIEF,
3:45 am  A Campus Police dis
patch sent several officers to 
Donner Hall in response to a 
complaint. The complainant, a 
Donner resident, stated that he 
saw some visitors carrying the 
basement foosball table up to the 
second floor. He also believed that 
the same individuals were the 
ones responsible for the urine 
outside of his dormitory room.
The police knocked on the room 
where presumably the actors 
were and spoke to the resident 
of the room. He claimed to 
know nothing of the urination. 
The guests were identified as 
University of West Virginia 
students. The group was in
structed to return the foosball 
table to its appropriate position, 
and they complied.
2/1 DISORDERLY CON
DUCT, 4:12 am - While in 
Donner Hall, a Campus Police 
officer smelled marijuana ema
nating from a basement dormi
tory room. He knocked on the 
room from which he believed the 
odor was coming.
The officer asked the actors who 
was supplying their marijuana, 
but they said it was not theirs 
and that they did not smoke any 
marijuana.
A check of the room revealed a 
large green bong, a glass tubular 
pipe, a small steel pipe, and a 
small Ziploc bag with organic resi
due inside it. The evidence was 
placed in the temporary evidence 
locker, where it awaits testing.
2/2 THREATS, 10:15 pm - A 
CMU student called Campus Po
lice and said that he had just 
spoken with his girlfriend. In 
their conversation, she had said 
that her ex-boyfriend physically 
assaulted her and that the actor 
was on his way to take care of 
her current boyfriend. The caller 
gave the dispatcher a physical 
description of the ex-boyfriend 
and also the make and model of 
his car. The caller was instructed 
to lock all his doors and to con
tact Campus Police immediately 
if the actor was seen around the 
callers fraternity.

President discusses 
earths sustainability
COHON, from page 1
easy talk to give.
Some people felt that Cohon 
should have addressed the ques
tions that were asked in more 
detail, rather than avoid con
frontation. Basically he just 
welcomed their suggestions, 
said Rajat Ghosh, a PhD stu
dent in civil and environmental 
engineering. Ghosh said the talk 
was more general and felt that 
culture and politics, which are 
important issues in sustainable 
development, were left out of 
the talk.
He spent a lot of time on the 
overview, said Shanee Michael, 
a masters student in civil and 
environmental engineering.
People get into the details too 
quick. Youve got to look at the 
big picture:
President Cohon said it was 
gratifying to be able to talk 
about his area of research and 
teaching interest instead of be
ing limited to administration. 
The topic is very important, 
Cohon said. I also think its 
valuable for the president to 
show that he has something to 
say, instead of being just an 
administrator.
Cohon currently serves as the 
chairman of the United States 
Nuclear Waste Technical Review 
Board. He commented that he 
hoped he would be able to give 
additional talks in the future.

2/6 CRIMINAL MISCHIEF,
12:06 am  A CPS employee called 
Campus Police to report an act of 
criminal mischief. The employee 
said that when he went to service 
the mens room, he noticed water 
leaking from under the door.
Once inside the restroom, he 
noticed that an unknown person 
had pulled the sink partially away 
from the wall, causing the sink 
pipes to shift and release water. 
A responding mechanic said that 
the sink was in no risk of falling 
from the wall, so a plumber was 
called to take care of the leaky 
pipes. A check of the rooms on the 
floor below revealed no signs of 
water coming from the ceiling.
 Chief of Campus Police James 
LaPaglia reviews all reports prior to 
release.
 Only three people on The Tartan 
staff see the reports: the editor-inchief, the news editor, and the 
staffwriter typing the report.

ants, victims,suspects, andfratemity 
names are omitted from the printed 
report. Ethnic descriptions and other 
personal details are given only in the

H&SS must 
improve Job Fair
H&SS held its first autonomous 
job fair last Thursday. While the 
fair was certainly a step in the 
right direction, it was also disap
pointing for humanities students 
who had expected to find a more 
diverse set of opportunities. There 
were few companies in atten
dance, and they represented the 
interests of only a small subset of 
the H&SS population  mainly 
technical writers and information 
systems majors. While events like 
the Business Opportunities Con
ference (BOC) and Technical Op
portunities Conference (TOC) get 
consistently high marks from stu
dents to whom they are targeted, 
the H&SS job fair has a long way 
to go in meeting the needs of its 
own students.
We must not discount the fact 
that a successful H&SS job fair is 
challenging for organizers. Com
petition in fields such as writing 
or psychology is fierce, and many 
companies in these areas do not 
need to recruit. But this is pre
cisely why the organizers  
H&SS and Career Center admin
istrators  need to ensure that 
students know what opportuni
ties are available and that com
panies know the talents that 
H&SS students have to offer.
H&SS is unique in that it offers 
a mix of liberal and professional 
education. This focus suits, those 
students who want to study hu
manities but also expect to be 
able to find a good job when they
CFA should expand 
selection of majors
The construction of the Purnell 
Center for the Performing Arts is 
making an impression on CMUs 
campus both literally and figura
tively. While the building will 
provide the College of Fine Arts 
the chance to expand classroom 
and studio space, it will also grant 
the opportunity to consider creat
ing more CPA certificate pro
grams. The attention and fund
ing that the construction of the 
Purnell Center is bringingto CMU 
makes this the perfect time for 
CFA to examine its curriculum 
and the benefits that the new 
building could provide.
CMU has always been known 
for its outstanding fine arts pro
gram, but there are some rela
tively common fine arts majors 
that are unavailable to CMU stu
dents. While jazz performance is 
offered as a minor, it deserves to 
be a certificate program. Expan
sion of this and other minors 
would attract a new student and 
faculty base to CMU, furthering 
its reputation as a cutting-edge 
fine arts institution. The move to 
expand minors into degree pro
grams would be logical and not 
very difficult, since experienced 
faculty and interested students 
are already on campus.
When it comes to creating new 
majors such as photography and 
film making, the status of the 
university should be considered. 
These are common majors at other 
competitive institutions, and stu
dents here should have the chance
graduate. If the college can con
tinue to use the term profes
sional, it must help put its 
students in a position where 
they are able to market their tal
ents effectively.
A job fair for H&SS should be 
considered an opportunities fair 
just like the BOC or TOC  it 
should also expose students to 
the wide range of opportunities 
available, including summer in
ternships and graduate schools. 
Also, it should include organiza
tions such as placement agencies 
which can provide students with 
a plethora of post-graduate ca
reer contacts and options.
H&SS students need a venue in 
which to communicate with a va
riety of quality prospective em
ployers, not just a place to drop off 
resumes. Organizers should 
entice non-recruiters with 
the opportunity to meet bright, 
articulate professionals 
whowould be invaluable 
assets to their companies.
Above all, it is important to rep
resent more fully the diverse set 
of interests which fall under the 
H&SS umbrella. This means a 
better dialogue between organiz
ers and students about which ca
reers are interesting and spark 
curiosity. More work needs to be 
done to ensure that an H&SS job 
fair is an event that opens the 
eyes of both students and employ
ers to the unique and varied op
portunities available to them.
Letters to the Editor
Letter to the Editor
Locker rooms 
lack security
Editor:
The services of our 
Campus Police de
partment are re
spected and wellknown. One great 
service that they 
provide to the community is the Crime 
Watch bulletins, informing the popula
tion of recent incidences and crime pat
terns that the average citizen, such as 
myself, should be aware of. One crime 
pattern that has been highly publicized 
and brought to the attention of the com
munity is the number of thefts that 
occur in the UC locker rooms.
Upon knowing of this information, I 
requested a lock at the UC equipment 
desk before I decided to use the hot tub
this Thursday evening  I had a coat, 
wallet, and keys in my posession.
Heres your towel.... Um, sorry, we 
dont have any locks. You can take your 
stuff with you [to wherever youre work
ing out] if you would like. 
Unfortunately, my intention was to 
use the hot tub that evening.
To the point of my writing. If one is 
trying to take measure to protect oneself 
from crime, and trying to lower the crime 
rate at the same time, how can this be 
done if the resources that I expect from 
my University arent readily available? 
Before one can point fingers, some ques
tions must be answered.
Why was the desk out of locks? I am 
left to conclude this is either due to 
people not returning them upon leaving 
the gym or the desk just having a small 
quantity of locks in stock. Addressing 
the prior, people who keep locks for their 
own intents and purposes are doing our 
theft-riddled community a great injus
tice. After my conversation with the desk 
attendant (and my filling out a comment 
card), I turned and went home, for I did 
not want to put my possessions at risk. 
Others may not do the same.
In addressing the latter, I would hate 
to hear that this is the reason why I 
couldnt get a lock, due to the fact that 
the locker rooms are the number-one 
spot for crime on campus. That would be 
sheer irresponsibility on the part of Ath
letics. If this is so, protective measures 
should be taken immediately  I dont 
believe its too difficult to get a Purchase 
Order for the local hardware store.
Before blaming the criminals for the 
rashes of crime on campus, we need to 
take a look at ourselves. With respect to 
our possessions, one cannot steal what 
is being given away.

to expand their knowledge in 
these fields as well. These pro
grams could be initially offered as 
minors and then expanded into 
majors as interest and funding 
grows.
In order to best serve the stu
dents and the university commu
nity, CFA could follow the ex
ample set by H&SS last spring. 
H&SS administrators circulated 
a survey which asked students 
which minors they would like to 
see added to its college curricu
lum. In this same manner, CFA 
could send out a comprehensive 
electronic survey that would pro
vide insight into what degree pro
grams students would like the 
chance to study.
Enhancing the curriculum in 
these ways is no easy task. No one 
expects change of this magnitude 
to happen overnight, but initial 
plans should be made now in or
der to raise money and hire fac
ulty so that new opportunities 
are available once the Purnell 
Center opens.
The Purnell Center should be a 
point of reference for both CFA 
and the University. The struc
ture itself will add a new dimen
sion to campus.
If CFA intends to maintain its 
innovative attitude and respected 
position in the field of fine arts, it 
should start considering not only 
the best ways to utilize its new 
space but also the attention and 
funding that the Purnell Center 
is attracting.

Our generation is lucky. We 
know how most sexually trans
mitted diseases are passed 
around and prevented. It isnt 
nuclear science, yet the num
ber of sexually transmitted 
diseases among our age group 
continues to rise. Its no longer 
an issue of not having the 
knowledge. It has become more 
of an issue of ignoring the 
knowledge and being sexu
ally irresponsible.
I dont intend to promote or 
bash abstinence nor to place 
value judgments on any 
individuals sexual behavior, 
but to ensure that students 
and others realize the impor
tance of taking responsibil
ity for sex.
The issue of sexual respon
sibility has become more than 
just a topic to write about. I 
recently became aware of the 
fact that Leah, a good friend of 
mine, has tested positive for 
HIV. She is a great person 
both on the inside and the out
side. This may sound like a 
rather generic'description, but 
its also the most fitting de
scription. Physically, imagine 
Tiffani-Amber Thiessen with 
light brown hair. She has a 
great body and dresses to ac
centuate it
Her personality only works' 
to complement her appear
ance. Unlike some attractive 
people, shes comfortable with 
her good looks. She isnt arro
gant but is an exhibitionist. 
Her physical appearance and 
personality are relevant be
cause they work to create an 
extremely attractive indi
vidual. An individual who has 
no problem getting a date. An 
individual whom most guys
would give their left leg to be 
with. This has been the case 
since Ive known her.
In high school, she dated 
several guys. Most were ath
letes and the type of athletes 
that were above average. 
Shean fit this mold perfectly. 
In the shallow world of high
school, Shean ____________
was a big deal.
He was part of 
an extremely 
exclusive clique 
and he was the 
type of guy you 
wanted to hang 
out with because he knew 
girls from every high school 
in the area. Shean went out 
with Leah for about a month 
and in that time period in
fected Leah with HIV.
I was in a total state of shock 
as Leah told me that she 
had tested posi
tive. The only 
thing I said was,
Im sorry.
The politically 
correct thing to 
say would have 
been you can 
beat this disease 
and it isnt a 
death sentence.
I usually say 
what I feel is the 
truth, not whats 
poli-tically cor
rect. However, 
even I couldnt 
say what I was 
feeling.
All I could think 
about was the fact 
that one of my best friends 
was going to die. It would be 
impossible as well as unfair 
for me to attempt to articu
late * the
way someone diagnosed 
with a deadly disease faces 
that news.
The thing that fascinates
me the most is Leahs reac
tion toward the guy who in
fected her. She takes respon
sibility for her actions and 
isnt attempting to blame or 
rationalize. The only thing Im 
sure of is that I will support 
Leah one hundred percent.
Leahs diagnosis as well as
dents on this campus are so 
smart that they never make 
an assumption concerning 
someones general appear
ance and HTV status.
I wish Leah would have 
been on that level two years 
ago. This entire ordeal has 
taught me that anyone can 
____________ have this terWe as a campus community 
and a generation must work to 
fight this disease and the mis
conceptions surrounding it 
Sheans diagnosis has been a 
loud and clear wake-up call. I 
never thought that hetero
sexual teenagers in small 
town America needed to give 
HIV and AIDS a second 
thought. If I saw Leah on the
Mary Tremonte/Tartan Junior Staff
street, Id view her as an ex
tremely attractive woman.
HIV would be the farthest 
thing from my mind, even ted diseases, 
though I know all the facts 
about the virus.
Sexual responsibility is 
about not making assump
tions. Im sure that some sturible disease. 
We as a cam
pus community i 
and a genera
tion must work 
to fight this dis
ease and the 
j ~ misconcep
tions surround
ing it. Every individual can 
combat this disease by using 
discretion and common sense.
People like Shean and Leah 
are on college campuses all 
across America unaware of 
their HIV status. We all know 
what safe sex 
means. It isnt 15- 
311. Sexual respon
sibility also calls for 
a great deal of self 
analysis. One needs 
to ask themselves if 
they are being truth
ful to their partner 
and themselves 
about their sexual 
past.
HIV tests are 
available on campus 
free of charge. If 
youve never been 
tested, get tested. 
The bottom line is 
that anyone can 
have sex. As hu
mans, we possess 
the capabilities to control our 
own destiny in regard to AIDS 
and sexually transmitWilliam-Neil Guzy is a

Human cloning sparks moral debate
Research benefits outrank fears
'Lorelei Laird
Is technology outpacing its creators? In 
the wake of last years furor over the impli
cations of successful cloning, some people 
have started to believe so. The state of 
California has already passed a law tempo
rarily banning human cloning; many other 
states and the federal government are con
sidering similar laws. President Clinton 
has cut federal funding for cloning research 
altogether and called for a voluntary fiveyear moratorium on the procedure in the 
private sector. Groups as diverse as the 
Southern Baptists, the Islamic Religious 
and Medical Symposium, and the World 
Health Organization have issued statements 
denouncing the procedure. But are they 
jumping the gun? I think so.
First and foremost, passing legislation 
against cloning is just plain dumb. Blanket 
outlawing of anything is just plain dumb, 
not only because it eats away at liberty but 
because it fails to take into account the 
variance of the real world. Furthermore, 
many of the legislators behind these laws 
are being more reactionary and passionate 
than rational. Politicians with little scien
tific knowledge are painting apocalyptic 
pictures of headless humans used as organ 
farms and made-to-order superslaves, and 
using them to push badly-worded laws that 
could end up doing more harm than good. In 
addition to severely limiting scientific lib
erty, these measures could (and do, in some 
cases) outlaw fertility treatments and es
tablished methods for scientific research in 
other areas. Plus, many of the procedures in 
question come from technologies we havent 
even developed yet. In perspective, this 
rush to ban all things clone-related seems 
a little paranoid.
Legislation aside, it should be noted that 
the arguments put forth against unrestricted 
human cloning are mostly valid when the 
hysteria is filtered out. There is an undeni
able risk to allowing people free rein with 
human DNA. Chicago physicist and nut 
case Richard Seed, who wants to start a 
multimillion-dollar vanity cloning clinic, has 
made himself a famous (if comparatively 
benign) example. However, theres a pretty 
big risk in giving people licenses to practice 
surgery too, and were certainly not going to 
outlaw doctors. Weigh that risk against the 
possible benefits for humanity: organ and 
tissue cloning, for instance, so that burn 
victims and transplant patients could have 
perfectly matched, readily available dona
tions, or embryo splitting and DNA replacement, eliminating inherited conditions 
like hemophilia forever. Not to mention 
the possibility of developing a complete 
gene map and answering all those little 
questions of nature vs. nurture. (Is there 
a gene for gayness? Alcoholism? Crimi
nal behavior?) All of this seems a little 
too much to pay for politicians paranoid 
visions of a society of inhuman drones.
Of course, cloning should not be al
lowed to go completely unregulated. Like 
many other disciplines, there should be 
a strong emphasis (perhaps stronger 
than usual in this case) during training 
on the responsibility that comes with 
the knowledge of bioengineering. 
Ethics classes should definitely be re
quired at every level. Also, there should 
be some sort 
of review 
board, public 
or private, 
to watch ge
netic re
search and to 
which re
searchers 
would be held 
accountable.
As much as I 
hate to say it, 
some restric
tions should 
be imposed by the federal government; 
there are people out there crazy enough 
to misuse this technology out of insanity 
or egotism. President Clintons volun
tary five-year moratorium isnt a bad 
idea. And perhaps a convention of think
ers, scientific, theological, and other
wise, could be called to meditate further 
on the issue. At the level of development 
our technology is now, were not in any 
danger of filling the world with mindless 
monsters. Its our responsibility to make 
sure that ethics have caught up by the 
time we reach that possibility.
We are far from a world of sidewalk 
cloning clinics and genetically engi
neered superhumans. Rather, we stand 
on the brink of discovering and profiting 
from the endless possibilities that come 
from a better understanding of the hu
man body. With careful scrutiny of the 
research being done in this field and a 
strong impression of responsibility on 
those being trained, we should be able to 
avoid such nightmare scenarios. Send in 
the clones.

Cloning violates human rights
eff Thlbert
Afuma Porter/Tartan Junior Staff
This whole cloning business was quite 
the rage a while back, but now the furor 
seems to have died away. Yet Im sure 
you remember Dolly, the sheep that Scot
tish scientists cloned last year, and the 
plethora of issues it raised since the 
cloning of animals meant that the clon
ing of human beings couldnt be far be
hind. There was a lot of talk about the 
ethical implications behind human clon
ing. And even if youve forgotten, it doesnt 
mean that the issues have gone away, 
especially given the recent declarations 
of one Dr. Rich
ard Seed, a 
Harvard-educated research 
scientist who 
claims that he 
only needs $2 
million and two 
years to bring 
about the first 
human clone 
birth. Some may 
see this as a 
great scientific 
achievement; I 
see it as a heinous crime against man
kind. In that vein, I think a discussion of 
ethical implications is important, now 
more than ever.
Before we tackle the ethics, it should 
be noted that Seeds method of cloning 
would result in a naturally-born baby, 
genetically identical to the parent. In
stinctively, a lot of people are frightened, 
or put off, by the idea of an instant twin. 
However, if we saw a baby clone of a 40- 
year old man, wed be less likely to asso
ciate the two  the baby wouldnt really 
seem like a clone, because we have the 
idea that a clone means an exact dupli
cate in every way, as opposed to an exact 
genetic duplicate, which is more proper.
Even if the baby and the 40-year old 
man dont look alike, the baby would still 
be that mans clone, which is still wrong. 
Its wrong for a number of reasons, some 
of which would probably appeal only to 
those of a religious bent, and others of 
which would only appeal to those who 
have a high opinion of individuality.
Hopefully, were all in that number, as 
it is individuality that is a part of what 
makes mankind the interesting (and 
important) group of creatures that it is. 
We are all unique in our own ways, and
without differentiating traits, there 
would be nothing to distinguish one of us 
from another  in some ways, wed be no 
better than machines, cranked out on an 
assembly line. Hell, wed be no better 
than frozen hamburgers in the 
McDonalds microwaves. This might 
seem extreme, and maybe it is, but re
member  at first, there was only one 
car and now were cranking them out by 
the thousands every day. How would you 
feel if you were mass produced? If you 
werent unique? If you werent special in 
any way, God-given or otherwise? All 
right, Ill stop leading the witness, but 
you see my point.
For their part, the religious arguments 
against human cloning seem to revolve 
around the idea that it is wrong to tamper 
with the order of things, as ordered by 
the Creator. The Creator laid things out 
in a certain way for a certain reason, and 
It means for these things to happen. If we 
alter the genetic structure of a human 
being, however, were most decidedly 
going against Its order. We should leave 
well enough alone, and let the Creator 
take care of the creating. Were trying to 
audition for the role of the Creator, and 
we just dont fit the part.
Other arguments against cloning fol
low from the above two basic premises: 
loss of individuality and playing God. A 
final major premise regards respect for 
human life. Cloning could very well lead 
to the mass production of stockhumans, 
destined for some menial task  or per
haps for organ donation  with no room 
to grow. Is this right? Just because one is 
a clone, and not a particularly great 
example of the advancement of man
kind, doesnt mean that one doesnt have 
fundamental human rights and free
doms. Clones are not animals  we cant 
breed them to serve our whims.
The issues surrounding cloning are 
very complex, and discussing them all 
would be difficult. However, I hope that 
it begins to be clear why human cloning 
is ironically inhuman and morally wrong, 
whether one believes in a Creator or not. 
The only real way to justify human clon
ing is to hold the view that humans are 
machines like your washer or computer 
 and, frankly, I think were all worth a 
little more than that.

Environmental protection paradigms must change
Editor's Notebook
Last week President Cohon 
spoke in McConomy Auditorium 
as part of a Distinguished Lec
ture series given at CMU. His 
talk, entitled Sustainable De
velopment: A Decision Making 
Problem, showcased his wide ex
perience in the area. Aside from a 
few questions, the audience, pri
marily CMU professors and de
partment heads, seemed pleased 
with his talk.
My reaction was slightly differ
ent. I am certainly not as well 
acquainted with environmental 
regulation or developments in en
vironmental protection as Cohon. 
He has had a long career ad
dressing environmental prob
lems, and I do not doubt his con
cern or motives for such issues. 
However, I was struck by a num
ber of things which were not said 
in relation to his topic and even to 
the points of his speech.
The first omission I noticed in 
Cohons speech was in his discus
sion of pollution and point-sources 
verses non-point-sources. Pointsource pollution is pollution from
one source, such as a large smoke
stack or factory. Non-point-sources 
are things like car exhaust pipes 
or refrigerators. They are called 
non-point-sources because the 
damage done by these devices is 
caused not so much by individual 
units but by the millions of them.
The problem of point-sources 
highlights the fact that the focus 
of environmental protection must 
now change from what had been 
the main problem, industrial pol
lution, to what has now superceded it in importance: individu
als and their daily lives.
Point-sources of pollution are 
easy to identify and control. In
the past they were not regulated, 
and the effort to bring them un
der control had been the focus of 
environmentalism. It was easy to 
target the large corporations 
which owned these point sources 
and rally people around the cause 
of controlling them. Non-pointsources have been harder to con
trol because they require people 
to modify their behavior. Things 
that are taken for granted in our 
lives are threatened by the need 
to reduce pollutants, and it is 
harder to bring people to change 
how they live.
This change in priorities causes 
the focus of environmental pro
tection to shift from pure regula
tion, which can be used to control 
point sources, to education and 
regulation. President Cohon did 
not bring this out in his speech, 
but it is nevertheless just as im
portant to realize.
As the presidents talk contin
ued, the topic of cost benefit analy
sis and the use of economic incen
tives to influence behavior were 
introduced. These two things 
raised a number of questions 
about the effectiveness of these 
tools. Obviously, in the past they 
have worked in some instances. 
However, they are now used to

ENVIRONMENT, from page 5
solve a large number of prob
lems for which they are illsuited. Cohon raised the issue 
of ethical content when mak
ing environmental decisions. 
He pointed out that, for those 
who focus on cost-benefit analy
sis and economics to the exclu
sion of other considerations, 
the value put on death in a 
developed country [is] 15 times 
higher than a less industrial
ized nation. I cant find the 
ethical content of that state
ment, at least not from any 
system of ethics with which I 
am familiar.
Economics certainly has its 
place in decision making. How
ever, the reliance upon it and 
use of it to justify statements 
like the one above are not ac
ceptable. Economic incentives 
for people to act in certain ways 
are in the same vein. The use of 
these incentives consists pri
marily of regulating the price 
of certain goods and services so 
that people will use the ones 
that are healthy for the envi
ronment and of limiting the use 
of goods and services that are 
bad for the environment.
The problem with this is 
twofold. The first is that it 
relies upon governmental bu
reaucracy to first identify and 
then deal with all of our envi
ronmental problems. The 
track record thus far shows 
that the response of the gov
ernment is usually slow and 
incomplete. The second prob
lem is that people arent aware 
of the purpose of these gov
ernment actions; and arent 
aware of the nature of their 
own actions.
Education would do a much 
better job of letting people know 
that what they do has conse
quences for the environment. 
If people were made aware of 
the problems that exist and 
were more conscious of their 
own actions, then specific be
havior such as gas consump
tion would be affected. At the 
same time, an awareness of 
other, more general, behaviors 
and attitudes that tend to be 
environmentally damaging 
could be raised.
I cannot be sure of how Cohon 
feels about all of these environ
mental issues. The truth is that 
economic tools and old ways of 
thinking about solving prob
lems have become a crutch. 
They are easier to rely upon 
and more expediently defended 
in the face of criticism. I do not 
believe that they are more ef
fective or that they will bring 
long-term change.
A greater openness must exist 
between the scientists who work 
to understand the environment 
and the public who lives in it. 
Oui* government and elected of
ficials who are trying to protect 
the environment must move to 
the harder path of consensusbuilding and education, rather 
than trying to accomplish their 
objectives through piecemeal 
legislation. Real protection ofthe 
environment now depends upon 
people realizing the effects of 
their actions and caring enough 
to do something about it. That 
cannot be legislated.

English 76-101 was created 
with noble intentions, I presume. 
Being able to write well is impor
tant, no matter what your major 
is. But, unfortunately, the course 
fails miserably when it comes to 
catering to the demands of indi
vidual majors.
76-101: Interpretation and 
Argument.... The goal of this 
course is to develop skills in both 
written and verbal communica
tion. The course thus serves as an 
introduction to the discourse of 
the academic community, as well 
as an introduction to some of the 
broader issues that the academic 
community address[es]. This 
excerpt is taken from the English 
Departments course description. 
To put it bluntly, this is a whole 
lot of nonsense
If the course is supposed to serve 
as an introduction to the discourse 
of the academic community, then 
it must recognize that the aca
demic community is very diverse 
and has different demands. For 
example, CIT majors find the 
course irrelevant in that it teaches 
Modem Language Association for
mat, which is something an engi
neer is not going to be using very 
often. Even history or professional
writing majors (two very writing
intensive departments) find 76- 
101 too general, and on the whole, 
uninteresting. The problem is that 
the course is too widely scoped and 
not tailor-made for different de
partments. What we really need 
are more focused courses. A tech
nical writing course for 
CIT and other techni
cal majors would be a 
good solution because 
they will be able to im
prove their technical 
writing skills.
To make matters 
worse, much of the 
reading for the course 
is extremely dull and 
uninteresting. For in
stance, Ellisons 
Masks and the Novel 
of Reality by Thomas 
Schaub, which was in
cluded in some sec
tions of the course last 
semester, is one of the most cryp
tic and asinine pieces of writing 
ever produced by man, so much 
so that you almost begin to think 
youre reading another language. 
Such reading material cannot 
give students a comprehensive 
grounding in writing processes, 
because if they read something 
that communicates uninterest
ingly or unintelligibly (or both), 
they cannot be expected to de
velop any good communication 
skills of their own. There is certainly a need to choose readings 
for the course more carefully, so 
as to make them more interest
ing and help in developing good 
speaking and writing skills, 
which is the real aim ofthe course.
Another drawback of the course 
is that it is too time-intensive.
Nell Babra/Tartan Art Staff 
Last semester, I spent more time 
on that course than on any other 
course that I was in, and Im an 
ECE major. Theres something 
clearly wrong with this picture. 
The course should be shortened 
by having it structured in such a 
way as to reduce the time spent 
outside class. Perhaps reducing 
the reading material for the 
course would help. The reading 
for the course is very unbalanced. 
In the first few weeks the amount 
of reading required is far more
than that required later. If the 
reading were spread out more 
evenly, it might be easier to cope 
with it.
One of the aims of the course is 
to teach us that its important to 
state your opinion, but more im
portant to support these opinions 
with facts. This idea is good. How
ever, in its implementation, sti
fling restrictions are placed on 
students, cutting off freedom and 
room for creativity.
The summary paper, for in
stance, allows students no room 
for opinion. It simply asks them to 
reproduce the instructors inter
pretation of an essay. The analysis 
paper also has very limited op
tions for expressing opinions, be
cause students are involved in 
analyzing other authors works and 
responses to a question for the 
most part. It is only towards the 
end of the course that they can 
express any opinions of their own. 
Even this assignment is bounded 
by a set of essays (quotations from 
other sources are frowned upon), 
adding rigidity to the papers. 
We need more flexible options, such 
as allowing us a choice of topics 
for papers and letting us choose 
sections from various essays to 
write about.

away trip. It is not the end of their ninegame series against UAA opponents, 
however. They play at home for the first 
time in two weeks this Friday and Sun
day, facing a rematch with both Wash
ington and Chicago.
Playing on the road is hard. The refs 
usually favor the home team, and we 
are not used to the court. At home, we 
have our fans to help us. said Harris.
The key to beating Washington may 
lie on the defensive end of the ball. The 
Bears strength is in their shooting 
skills, while the Tartans rely on a wellrounded attack. CMU simply does not 
have the offensive power to put 70 to 90 
points on the board every game, so 
another 79-point showing from Wash
ington would make it very difficult if 
not impossible for the team to knock off 
the UAA leaders.
Sundays game against Chicago will 
be a chance for the team to move up in 
the division and end the nine-game UAA 
streak on a positive note. The Tartans 
will focus on a consistent attack and 
attempt to minimize the number of fouls 
they commit against Chicago  some
thing that killed them the last time the 
two teams met.

narrow 34-32 lead, when an AllStar athlete put up a rebound to 
extend the lead to 36-32. The 
Tartans countered with an easy 
lay-up, but the All-Stars an
swered with another basket of 
their own. With time running 
down, the Tartans evened the 
score to 38-38 with a shot from 
the outside and a layup off of a 
rebound. With only 11 seconds 
remaining, a time-out was called. 
Coming out of the huddle, how
ever, the self-coached Tartans 
had a team miscommunication, 
and they were assessed a pen
alty for having their entire nineman team on the court at the 
same time. This allowed the AllStars to pull into the lead for 
the final time by sinking the 
free-throw shot, making the 
score 39-38 with only ten sec
onds left in the game. From 
there, the All-Stars drove to the 
hoop one more time to put in 
the last basket of the game, 
and the All-Stars took home a 
41-38 victory.
I had a great time on Sun-day, 
said Truxillo. It wasvery worth
while. I greatly enjoyed spending 
time with the Special Olympians.

John Henry Newman 
on Faith as
"The Reasoning of the Religious Mind"
Katherine Tillman, Ph.D.
Professor of Liberal Studies, University of Notre Dame
People today, those who think about God 
at all, often go to one of two extremes: 
either they are caught up in exclusively 
rational arguments and logical proofs for 
or against the existence of God, or their 
approach to God is exclusively emotional, 
even anti-intellectual. John Henry Newman 
(1801-189(1), distinguished man of letters 
and saintly leader in the Anglican and 
then Catholic churches, proposes a helpful 
solution that calls the whole person, mind 
and heart, into thoughtful communion with 
the God of Jesus Christ.

The All-Star game was merely 
one part of the all-day basket
ball tournament. Teams also 
competed in three-on-three and 
five-on-five double elimination 
tournaments, as well as a bas
ketball skills competition which 
included passing, dribbling, 
and shooting skills tests. Over 
50 men and women with men
tal retardation between the 
ages of 9 and 40 competed in 
the events of the day, coached 
by teams of volunteers who 
work with the athletes yearround. The tournament was 
supported by donations from a 
number of corporations, and the 
event raised over $7,000 for Al
legheny County Special Olym
pics, which will use the funds 
to help support the 19 training 
sites in the county, maintain 
facilities, and purchase equip
ment and uniforms.
Although the focus was on 
the athletes and their accom
plishments, the tournament 
would not have been possible if 
not for the numerous volunteers
 many from Carnegie Mellon
 who donated their time on a 
Sunday. There were so many 
volunteers who came from all 
over that event coordinators ran
out of jobs for them to do. A1 
Martin of the Pittsburgh Pirates 
delivered a special address as 
part of the opening ceremonies 
of the invitational. Id guess 
that 98 percent of the people 
here have never been exposed to 
Special Olympics at all, said 
event director Gregg Beloff, a 
masters student in industrial 
administration and a coach for 
the Jewish Community Center. 
Beloff said that one benefit 
about having so many volun
teers was that so many people 
got to spend time with the ath
letes and see what great people 
the athletes really are. [The 
athletes] are terrific kids and 
great athletes and love what 
they do.... What a great oppor
tunity to get everyone involved 
exposed to Special Olympics. 
The Special Olympics Basket
ball Tournament was probably 
one of the most rewarding expe
riences of my life, said senior 
Joe Mlakar, who spent the ma
jority of the day escorting one of 
the athletes. She made me real
ize how much it really means to 
give your all in everything.... The 
whole experience gave me a 
newfound respect for all of these 
special athletes.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  9 February 19989Americans fail to see beyond medals count
OLYMPICS, from page 10
Dream Team format as the Olympics 
in 1996.the U-S. defeated Canada for 
tije gold. Look for the United States, 
Canada, and Sweden to battle for the 
title this time around. Freestyle ski
ing, luge, and alpine skiing are also 
possible, although less certain, sports 
to yield spots on the medal stand for 
the United States.
All this points to a record-setting per
formance by the United States in 
Nagano. Exact medal predictions vary. 
Paul George, vice president oftheUnited 
Spates Olympic Committee, thinks 18 
ntedals is a reasonable goal. Sports Il
lustrated, apparently hoping patriotic 
feelings will help sell magazines, pushes
the mark to a very high 21. A more 
reasonable total is forwarded by Bill 
Hybl, the USOC president, who says 14.
All of this, however, is mere guess
work. As the games unfold, unexpected 
heroes will undoubtedly emerge from 
the mass of competitors. Favorites 
will inevitably fall on the slippery 
snow and ice of Nagano. No matter 
what happens, the XVIII Winter Olym
piad will strive for ideals of sports
manship, honor, and the provision of 
an equal playing field for all the 
worlds people. This is something that 
every American can agree with  as 
long as we are serenaded often enough 
with The Star-Spangled Banner 
to keep us content.

Washington game, and in the first half, 
scored 35 points as compared to the 26 
they managed the game before. This 
might have boded well for the Tartans 
had Washington not scored 58 points in 
tie first half.
The second half was again a mirror of the 
first. Washington continued to hit on all 
cylinders as CMU struggled from the floor.
; In the end, a 42 point second half was 
not enough for the Tartans. Washing
ton hit 50 percent of their three-point 
shots for the game and in the end 
routed Carnegie Mellon, 108-77.
For the second straight game, CMU 
turned the ball over more times than 
the team collected assists. Carnegie 
Mellon rebounded as well as Washing
ton, but the team couldnt overcome 
their scoring troubles.
Last weekend, CMU went on the road 
again to play Brandeis University and 
New York University. Carnegie Mellon 
has already beaten both teams earlier 
in the season, so if the trip goes well, 
Carnegie Mellon should be able to 
pull out two more wins before re
turning home to face Washington and 
Chicago once again.
Womens hockey goes global
On Net
by Jessica Strelitz
It was no surprise that the top three 
seeds in womens Olympic hockey rolled 
to shut-out wins in the first weekend of 
competition in Nagano, Japan. Canada, 
the U.S., and Finland, ranked 1-2-3 by 
most polls before the Olympics, com
bined to outscore their opponents 24-0. 
Finland beat arch-rival Sweden, 6-0, 
Canada destroyed Japan, 13-0 (the only 
reason why Japan has a team is be
cause they are the host country; they 
lost their exhibition game to the U.S. 
10-0 last week), and the U.S. ended the 
first day of competition with a 5-0 vic
tory over China. These girls can play, 
and they have been helped along in the 
past ten years by a burst of interest in 
hockey from women worldwide.
It has been in North America where the 
most opportunities for girls to play rough 
and dangerous sports, like ice hockey, 
have arisen. In the late 1970s, when I 
started, there were only three girls play
ing in my area. We played with the guys, 
as there were no separate leagues. But at 
right about 12 or 13, the big divisions 
began. Puberty. Like it wasnt undigni
fied enough to have to change in the 
bathroom, there were also the teasing 
and low blows on the ice from male oppo
nents. Sure, it was easy to put the boys
back in their place for a while, but when 
they shot up to-six feet-two, 220  the 
womens leagues were bom.
The New England leagues turned out 
10 of the 20 current Olympians that are 
playing in Nagano today. Ten women, all 
between 18-31, who had no idea that when 
Mom and Dad replaced the pink, doublerunner figure skates for the ugly, black 
hockey skates when they 
were five, it would change 
their lives forever. Most of 
them played with boys un
til they went to college.
Traditionalhockeyfamilies that with boys all play
ing ice hockey and their 
sisters figure skating, 
shifted. A perfect example 
is Cammi Granato, the 26- 
year-old sister of San Jose 
Sharks winger Tony 
Granato and captain of the 
U.S. womens team. She 
grew up playing against 
her brothers and their 
friends in Illinois. Early on,
Granato was confident that 
the U.S. women could take 
home the gold, but was 
even more excited about 
the positive impact that theMark Adato/Tartan Art Co-Editor 
introduction of womens ice hockey to the 
Olympic games will have on the sport.
Michele Amidon, coach of the Bowdoin 
College womens program and a member 
of the U.S. Training squad since high 
school, took sabbatical from school this 
year to try out for the Olympicteam. When 
I talked to her this summer, she was at try
outs in Massachusetts. Forty-five women 
from across the country had been called to 
camp, but only 20 were to make the squad.
After weeks of rigorous three-a-days', 
weight training, and conditioning, . 
Amidon was cut. Though she had re- , 
cently been a member of a silver-medal 
winning squad at an international com
petition in Finland, her knees just 
couldnt handle it (she had previous ; 
complications as well.) She is now run
ning a hockey camp for women in Colo
rado, but when we : 
spoke this summer, . 
she was filled with , 
dreams and confi-_ 
dence  fueled by; 
ideas of a potential;,., 
professional womens;, 
league to possiblystart in the U.S. af
ter the Olympics.. 
Ami- don had signed 
a contract and scouts  
were out looking for 
more women every 
day. She and-: 
Granato share the . 
same hope: If youl 
give us the puck, we', 
can play the game 
beautifully, with finesse and drive.
A womens revolu- * 
tion is going on 
throughout Olympic camp in Nagano. The - 
International Olympic Committee announced last week that starting now, any t 
new sport seeking entry to the games 
must include a womens event as well.. 
Changes are a cornin. I expect all of you to t 
get your asses up for the next week and
watch it happen right before your eyes.

Brangwynne stepped up his game 
further, keeping the puck out of 
the zone and hitting hard.
I was nervous. We had just 
lost the big dogs, [Voulgaris and 
Mitzel]. But we held it together. 
[Chin] and [Tsangl were solid,
looking good and holding their 
own. I was just playing my game, 
trying to be a leader but hanging 
tight, said Brangwynne.
Edinboro managed another 
goal on the power play, making it 
3-2 and scaring up some tense 
moments for a CMU team that
was trying desperately to hang 
on to the advantage. With two 
minutes remaining in the nailbiter, Brangwynne sent the puck 
up the boards to Fitzgerald, who 
sent it over to Berkowitz. The

continued, as Berkowitz got the 
puck to Duncan, who slapped in 
the insurance goal. The Tartans 
had held on to win it, 4-2.
Head coach Fred Maddalena 
and all of the players echoed the 
sentiment that it was team effort 
that won the game. With three 
tough opponents in the next two 
weeks, CMU is getting ready for 
a wild ride. I wish that the guys 
would start making it easier on 
me, said Maddalena, grinning 
after the close game. The CMU 
record now stands at 6-4-1 in the 
division, 6-6-1 overall.
Berkowitz and Duncan were 
elated, both saying that they had 
managed to get behind the de
fense the entire night and that 
the team had controlled the game 
in the neutral zone, not allowing 
any odd-man rushes. I like our 
chances going ahead, said 
Duncan, who played probably his 
best game of the year.
I think the win is proof that 
were coming together as a team.

We looked much better against 
Edinboro this semester than last, 
and this win proves that our last 
three games arent just flukes or 
easy wins, said Kliegman, who 
had 27 saves on the night. 
Ive got a good feeling about the

U.S. squad aimsClub team inches toward playoffs
for gold medals
By PETER PATTERSON
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
The Olympic Games. These 
words bring thoughts of noble 
young athletes,representing 
their country on the playing 
field before the eyes of the world. 
For two weeks, tens of nations 
meet and compete against each 
other with a common spirit of 
sportsmanship and honor. The 
Olympic Games offer an oppor
tunity for the youth of the world 
to gather in a spirit of friend
ship, enjoying each others com
pany as they learn the impor
tance of values that transcend 
the differences in nationality, 
culture and geography, says 
Juan Antonio Samaranch, 
President of the International 
Olympic Committee.
In the culture of American 
sports, the ideals of honor, valor, 
and sportsmanship are appreNagano 1998
Games of the XVIII Olympiad
ciated, but even more so if 
victory can be added to this list. 
After all, who remembers the 
losers? Brilliant athletes such 
as Dan Marino, Charles 
Barkley, and Jim Kelly are con
sidered to have led incomplete 
careers due to the lack of bring
ing a title to their team.
Not surprisingly, this atti
tude carries over in the minds 
of many to the Olympics. While 
athletes and television com
mentators echo the statement 
m ade by Samaranch about the 
high ideals of the games, 
Americans intently follow the 
daily medal count published 
in their newspapers.
The concentration on the 
glory of the Winter Games hides 
a dirty little secret held by the 
United States: We are not very 
good, at least according to the 
expectation among many that 
we should be the best. The last 
time the United States led the 
medal count was way back in 
1932. In the whole history of 
the Winter Games, the U.S. is a 
distant third in the medal 
rankings, behind Norway and 
the old Soviet Union.
Of late, the situation has not 
been improving significantly.
In the 1988 Calgary games, 
the Americans came away with 
a paltry total of six medals. 
This led to an increasing effort 
to better the national winter 
sports program.
It paid off in Lillehammer in 
1994 with a record total of 13 
medals, including six golds. 
This record number of medals 
is a bit misleading, however, 
as the 1994 games were the 
largest to date, awarding many 
more medals overall than ever 
before. The U.S. was only fifth 
in the overall rankings, with 
their total number of medals 
being doubled by the 26 earned 
by Norway.
So, how will our 183 athletes 
fare in this, the XVIII Winter 
Olympiad? One concern is the 
fact that the winners of four 
out of the six gold medals 
earned at Lillehammer have 
retired and will be watching 
these games from the side
lines. Helping to compen
sate for this loss is the pres
ence of new events in this 
years games which figure 
to favor the Americans. A 
gold or silver medal is nearly 
guaranteed in womens 
hockey, as the U.S. and 
Canada have dominated 
world competition. Also 
added this year is 
snowboarding, and the Ameri
cans have been successful in 
this Winter X-Game sport.
Mike Jacoby is a two-time 
winner in the world cup gi
ant slalom ski competition 
and was the runner up at the 
1997 world championships. 
Sondra VanErt has been 
equally successful in the 
womens division.
The U.S. is also looking well 
in more traditional competi
tions such as figure skating. 
American women Michelle 
Kwan and Tara Lipinski, each 
a recent world championship 
winner, are expected to battle 
for gold. Nicole Bobek, who 
was third in the worlds in 
1995, could also sneak into 
the medal hunt as well. On 
the mens side, Todd Eldridge, 
a five time national champion, 
will use his consistent skating 
style to challenge his more 
flamboyant Canadian coun
terpart, Elvis Stojko.
The use of NHL players in 
hockey also gives the U.S. a 
much better chance than 
theyve had in recent games.

defense. CMU matched their ag
gressiveness and went a step fur
ther. After having difficulties in
continued to hustle strong to the 
puck, outshooting CMU in the 
first period 11-7. But starting 
goaltender and grad student Jon 
Kliegman stoned the EU offense, 
much to the delight of the packed 
home stands. Two minutes into 
the second period, the first line, 
trying to clear the puck after a 
long shift, got one of the most 
surprising goals of the season  
and a crucial one. Same situa
tion: Voulgaris and Duncan got 
the puck into the zone, but 
Duncan sent a long shot towards 
net just as Berkowitz was skat
ing away from the zone. 
Berkowitz had his stick down and 
the puck hit it just right so that it 
deflected off into the practically 
wide-open net. Everyone was 
stunned. There 
was no one that 
was gonna catch 
(Duncan and him). 
We knew where 
each other were all 
night long, said 
Berkowitz.
The 2-0 lead fired 
the Tartans up. 
Sophomores Bran
don Paluzzi and 
Przemyslaw Grzy
wacz led the physi
cal attack on the 
much-larger Edin
boro squad, frus
trating the oppos
ing team into mak
ing stupid penal
ties. Voulgaris con
tinued to anchor 
the defense, sacri
ficing his body to 
stop any slight rush 
by the EU squad, 
and then complet
ing his plays with 
shots on net or pen
etrating the EU zone.
Edinboro scored on the power 
play late in the period, but 20 
seconds later, the second line of 
Grzywacz, junior Steve 
Leonhardt, and senior Derek 
Jander went into EU territory 
hard. After Grzywacz and Jarider 
threw the puck on net and the 
goal tender couldnt control the 
rebounds, the disk came out to 
senior defenseman Dave Mitzel.
Mitzel keyed up and shot the puck 
in high, scoring what would be 
the go-ahead goal for the game. I 
didnt even see it go in, said 
Mitzel after the game.
Jander, who was close to the 
crease on the shot, skated to
wards the ref to make sure that 
he wouldnt dispute the goal, but 
as he went the EU goaltender 
gave Jander a shove. Jander 
wheeled and suddenly eight play, 
ers were dancing. We were cel
ebrating the goal then the next 
thing I know, my chin strap was 
around my ears because some 
guy was grabbing my face mask, 
said Jander about the scuffle. 
That player was given a game 
misconduct and disqualification, 
but the three other EU players 
and four CMU players who had 
been involved in the skirmish 
quickly joined him.
I think that the fact that ev
eryone got kicked out was unnec
essary and uncalled for, said 
Jander. Voulgaris, who was also 
kicked out, agreed. Rather than 
make any real decisions, [the refs] 
just grouped us together and 
threw us off. The two were joined 
by Mitzel, who had. just reached 
the scene and not touched any
one when the refs stopped the 
altercation, and even Jander, who 
was down on the ice for most of 
the attack, was included.
Carnegie Mellon had to start 
the final period with a narrow 
lead, 3-1, and minus the teams 
top two defensemen and almost 
the entire second line. Sophomore 
Cliff Brangwynne, junior Alex 
Chin, and freshmen Aaron Hula, 
Harry Tsang, and Doug Faust 
anchored the defense for the re
maining time. Hula had already 
played an exceptional game, and

Last Sunday, the Tartans laced up their 
high-tops and took to the court at Skibo 
Gymnasium to face off against their oppo
nents. The crowd booed them. The crowd 
wasnt there to watch the Tartans  they 
were there to support the real home team, 
which they wanted to see kick the Tar
tans collective butts all around the court.
The home team was the Special Olym
pic All-Stars, comprised of the best ath
letes from five area teams. The Tartans 
were members of the CMU football team, 
who volunteered their time on a Sunday 
afternoon to face off against the All-Stars 
in the final event of the GSIA/Carnegie 
Mellon University Special Olympics Bas
ketball Invitational. The nine-man Tar
tan squad was comprised of junior Mike 
Stango, sophomore Eric Bartko, junior 
Jason Funke, junior Matthew Morris, 
sophomore Dan Flambard, sophomore
Tom Truxillo, freshman Bob Tracey, 
freshman Matt Norretto, and sophomore 
Todd Connelly.
The game was friendly yet competitive, 
as the Tartans kept the All-Star athletes 
on their toes and gave them a good game 
that let the All-Stars show their skills. It 
was clear from the opening tip-off that the 
All-Stars were the fans favorite team. 
Every shot, rebound, and steal for the AllStars was greeted with enthusiastic ap
plause and cheers from the assembled 
family members, teammates, and volun
teers who were watching the game. The 
Tartans opted for a reserved playing style, 
passing around the perimeter looking for 
scoring opportunities, while the All-Stars 
played more diversely  scoring on drives 
to the hoop, lay-ups, rebounds, and out
side shots. If possible, the crowd got even 
more enthusiastic as the game progressed 
to an edge-of-the-seat finish. With only 
minutes left, the All-Stars commanded a

Special Olympians celebrate win over CMU football.Mens game suffers away from home
By NATHAN STEINWALD
Tartan Sports Co-Editor
On Friday, January 30, the mens bas
ketball team headed off to the Univer
sity of Chicago for the first of a fourgame road trip against UAA opponents. 
The meeting did not go well for the 
Tartans, and the second game that week
end against Washington University in 
St. Louis was equally inauspicious.
Going into Chicago, CMU had put 
together two wins in a row at home to 
improve its standing in the UAA. For 
the first time this season, CMU 
seemed to be in the middle of the pack 
in the UAA. A few wins on the road 
wouldnt place the team at the top of 
the conference, but it would place it in 
a respectable position going into the 
end of the season.
Instead of the road games bolstering 
CMUs record, they pushed the Tartans 
back in the standings once again. This 
time the University of Chicago, unde
feated in UAA play, spoiled Carnegie 
Mellons hopes.
The game started off poorly for the 
Tartans, who have had trouble opening 
games well on the road.
In the first half, CMU hit only 10 out 
of 44 shots. This paled in comparison to
Chicagos 19 of 43 shooting. Chicagos the University of Washington in St.

The game went poorly for 
CMU. The team had a grand 
total of only eight assists 
throughout the game. This, 
combined with their 15 
turnovers and poor shoot
ing doomed the team. Brian Smith/Tartan Sports Co-Editor

Tartan women struggle 
against UAA opponents
By BRIAN SMITH
Tartan Sports Co-Editor
The Carnegie Mellon womens bas
ketball team is in a slump at possibly 
the most crucial time of their season. 
This past weekend^ they lost back-toback away games to the University of 
Chicago and Washington University in 
St. Louis. The losses extend the Tar
tans losing streak to five and come in 
the middle of nine straight games 
against UAA opponents.
Our playing has been good, except 
the fact that we foul too much, said 
sophomore guard/forward Hilary Har
ris. We are usually equal with the 
team, except they get to the line more 
than we do.
This was the case last Friday when 
the Tartans lost 58-54 to the Univer
sity of Chicago. The first half went 
quite well, as the women sank 12 of 25 
field goals and had a .750 shooting 
percentage from the free-throw line. 
They played exceptional defense as well, 
holding the Maroons offense to 27 
points and a .385 shooting percentage 
while keeping the fouls in check.
However, the second half was like 
another game. The team had difficulty 
on offense, making only seven of 19 
two-point field goals and one of five 
three-pointers while allowing Chicago 
a .500 field goal percentage. The decid
ing factor in the game, though, may 
have been fouls. CMU gave Chicago 16 
free throw opportunities, and they 
cashed in with 10 points. The Tartans 
were only able to get one second-half 
free throw point and lost by four, de
spite double-digit showings by senior 
center Katie OLeary and sophomore 
forward Samantha Majernik.
The team was back on the courts 
Sunday, February 1, this time in St. 
Louis. Possibilities of ending the fourgame loosing streak faded quickly, as 
the women were no match for firstplace Washington University. The 
Bears doubled CMU in the first half 
34-16, as the Tartans sunk less than 
one quarter of their field goals.
The second half saw more offense all 
around. The Tartans managed 28 points, 
led by forward Kristy Thomas and cen
ter Kara Coval, both sophomores who

Students connect 
with alumni
Slice' gives students 
guidance for life
By SHEILA FLANAGAN
Tartan Staffwriter
If youre like most CMU students, 
u found the transition to a college 
:ampus to be fairly painless. When 
you arrived at CMU your fresh
man year, you had a large sup
port group of upperclassmen and 
administrators to show you
around campus and __________
point you towards the 
main Pittsburgh at
tractions. Buthave you 
ever wondered about 
life after CMU, when 
you may need to move 
a different city for 
graduate school or for 
a new job? In the ab
sence of your friends and fam
ily, will you know how to find a 
decent apartment, how to ne
gotiate the best deal on a 
new car, and how to adjust 
to a new office environ
ment? Approximately 170 
CMU students found the 
answers to these questions 
when they attended the 
eighth annual Slice of Life 
program in the University 
Center last Saturday.
This program, which was 
sponsored by the Career 
Center and the Student 
Alumni Relations Coun
cil (SARC), provided stu
dents with the opportu
nity to attend four 
hour-long sessions
on topics such as Navigating Your 
Workplace, Inventing 101, and 
Stretching Your Paycheck. The ses
sions were conducted by CMU alumni 
who volunteered to come back to qampus to be a part of this program.
I hope students will first of all realize 
what alumni have to offer them and also 
how to make that transition from living 
on a college campus for four years to the

real world, said Tammy Manski, a 
sophomore business administration (BA) 
major and the Slice of Life chair.
Students were not only able to garner 
advice from alumni at the sessions, but 
they also had a chance to interact more 
closely with them at a mid-day reception 
held in the Schatz dining room. This 
networking opportunity makes Slice of 
Life different from other programs of
fered by the Career Center, according to 
Karen Litzinger, a Career Center con
sultant and organizer of Slice of Life.
We try to focus only on the collegecareer transition because the Career 
Center already focuses on the job search, 
said Litzinger. Weve really fine-tuned 
this over the years to focus on that.
Alumni seem to be the best source of 
information when it comes to leaving CMU 
for one simple reason: Theyve been there.
The thing that was 
difficult for me was be
ing in an environment 
where I didnt know the 
city or anybody else 
there, said Amy Hughes, a 
95 alum of H&SS. Her first job 
was with Hewitt Associates, an 
employee benefits consulting firm 
in Connecticut. Hughes, who is now 
the assistant director of ad
missions at GSIA, added that 
she was fortunate enough to 
meet other recent college 
graduates at her first job 
and was able to form a 
close network with 
them.
Hughes and other 
alumni agree that 
Slice of Life is an excel
lent way to provide stu
dents with the knowl
edge that they may not 
have had when they 
graduated from CMU.
I had no expecta
tions.... I didnt know 
anybody that was 
working in the profes
sions, said Christine 
Ferguson, an 82 indus
trial management alum, 
who is currently an assis
tant vice president at

Last Saturdays Slice of Life program 
was an example of how CMU alumni can 
help current undergraduates make the 
transition from campus to career. The 
Program is only one day, however, and 
Nay not adequately provide all the an
swers that a future graduate has. That is 
why CMU offers many alumni resources 
that students can use to find out what the 
world really is like after graduation.
There are several opportunities for 
students to contact alumni throughout 
the year. Many of these programs exist 
through the Student Alumni Relations 
Council (SARC). The goal of SARC is to 
strengthen the relationship between stu
dents and alumni through various ac
tivities and programs in conjunction with 
the Alumni Association. SARC is re
sponsible for coordinating the annual 
Slice of Life conference.
Another program that SARC continu
ity runs is the Carnegie Exchange. 
Through this program, students can visit 
the homes of alumni who live in the 
Pittsburgh area and meet informally 
with them to talk about anything that 
they are concerned about.
Its an opportunity to get off campus 
and talk about life, career options, rais
ing children  whatever you want, 
said Rebecca Florey, senior assistant 
director of alumni relations and direc
tor of SARC.
Carsen Kline, a junior materials sci
ence and engineering (MSE) major, 
recently participated in the Exchange 
program. He had the opportunity to 
eat dinner with Robert Schmitt, an 80 
H&SS alum and President of the Pitts
burgh alumni group.
It was a really good experience to meet 
someone who still appreciates the school a 
lot and wants to know what the students 
are doing, said Kline. The dinner was 
good... [we were] just sitting and having a 
good time chatting about anything. 
Every fall, SARC is also in charge of 
organizing Homecoming. During the 
three-day celebration, many alumni come 
back and participate in a variety of func
tions and reunions. In planningthis event, 
SARC works closely with the Alumni 
Association and with other student orga
nizations to provide entertainment such 
as the concert and bonfire last fall.
The Career Center also offers students 
the opportunity to network with alumni

Grad shares teaching experience
By RYAN DONOVAN
Tartan Contributing Editor
Michelle Vollmar was about to 
leave the first-grade class which she 
teaches early because she was sick. 
She had secured a substitute teacher, 
and was about to go home when one 
of her students came up to her and 
kissed her on the cheek. Before she 
knew it, all 19 of her students sur
rounded her, hugged her, and said, 
Get well, get well.
Last Thursday, Vollmar talked to 
students in Mudge Lounge about her 
experiences in Teach for America, a 
non-profit group that places recent 
college graduates in teaching posi
tions in under-resourced urban and 
rural schools. She cited it as one of the 
most difficult and most rewarding 
experiences of her life.
Vollmar, who graduated last year 
with a major in creative writing and a 
minor in Spanish, had no previous 
teaching experience, but she is cur
rently teaching first graders at the 
Washington Accelerated School in 
Pasadena, Calif., located near Los An
geles. She is currently in the middle of 
her first of two years in the program 
and worlds away from her CMU days.
At CMU, I knew how to work the 
system, and I knew how to succeed,
said Vollmar. Now Im in an 
environment where I dont 
know how to do it so well.
Last year when gradua
tion time rolled around,
Vollmar was nervous about 
her future. Teach for 
America was the answer she 
found. I saw Teach for 
America, and it really spoke 
to me, said Vollmar. She 
filled out the application 
and sent it off to the na
tional offices. Three weeks 
later, she received notifica
tion that she was accepted 
for an interview.
The interview is an intense 
selection process, according 
to Vollmar. It includes a fiveminute teaching segment, 
which she said is a brief but 
important part of the process.
There is also a group discus
sion on a topic in education, 
and then what Vollmar called 
the hardest part: thepersonal Vollmar has 
interview, which lasts 15 min- Los Angeles 
utes or more. For bilingual 
candidates like Vollmar, there is also a 
writing assessment test in the second 
language. Finally, there is the placement 
interview, where candidates can decide 
which region would be best for them and

BOULDER, Colo. (U-Wire)  The year 
is 1843. A colonist in South Africa or a 
trader in Peru glances casually across 
the familiar, unchanging patterns of the 
clear night sky, and his eyes come to rest 
near the Southern Cross. Thats when 
hes startled by a glaring beacon that 
wasnt there the night before. The or
derly and predictable universe he knew 
yesterday has changed forever.
Scientists now know that beacon to be 
the star eta Carinae. It is famous for 
having survived a massive explosion in 
1843, becoming the second brightest 
object in the night sky. Since then, it has 
puzzled astronomers, who know that 
when a star explodes, it dies.
But eta Carinae is still up there, and 
Colorado University (CU) researchers 
may have discovered why. Eta Carinae 
is actually two stars, the most massive 
double-star system ever found.
Visiting researcher Augusto Damineli 
and Professor Peter Conti work at the 
University of Colorados Joint Institute 
for Laboratory Astrophysics (JILA). 
While working as a professor at Sao 
Paulo University in Brazil, Damineli 
became interested in eta Carinae de
spite himself. He felt that the photoge
nic star was already getting too much
attention, and he preferred to avoid this 
faraway celebrity in favor of lesserknown phenomena. Then, in 1989, he 
came across some intriguing data. Eta 
Carinae was giving off very, very power
ful X-rays at one particular wavelength. 
In fact, said Damineli, the energy at that 
wavelength alone was 3,000 times more 
powerful than that of our own sun.
Then, in June 1992, the X-rays faded 
completely. They came back in July 
and continued to grow until 1995. Other 
astronomers had noted that this cycle 
repeated every five-and-a-half years. 
Damineli wondered how a star so bright 
and so large could exist at all. I tried 
to understand this star, but it was too 
massive.... There was no good, explana
tion for a star like that in normal stel
lar astronomy, he said.
According to modern astronomy, a star 
can only be so massive before it collapses 
under its own weight, destroying itself 
in a supernova. But eta Carinae was 
alive and well.
When he showed CU professor Peter 
Conti the puzzling data, Conti said there 
must be two stars hiding inside. The new 
binary theory got laughs from Daminelis 
peers, making his work difficult.
Because his theory seemed preposter
ous, he had difficulty gaining access to 
the powerful telescopes that were al
ready in high demand. So he put his 
reputation on the line and predicted 
that on December 10, 1997, the X-rays 
would drop out of sight. His calculation 
was based on the fact that binary stars 
have an extremely precise orbital clock. 
The time it takes for the stars to orbit 
each other will always be the same, 
which was Daminelis whole point. He 
was counting on it.
Sure enough, the X-rays bottomed out 
right on December 10, and Daminelis 
discovery was splashed all over the press. 
He finally had the recognition he needed.
This opened the door for many obser
vatories, he said, and has chosen the 
Hubble Space Telescope among other 
instruments for extreme close-ups of eta 
Carinae. These stars have fascinated 
astronomers for decades, but this dis
covery eluded them until now.
In hindsight its all pretty clear.... 
[We] just didnt think about what that 
could mean, Conti said.
The discoveries didnt end with the 
binary theory. Damineli also learned 
that the X-rays werent even coming 
from the stars themselves, but by the 
collision of their solar winds as they tore
past each other. Although most of his 
observing was done in Brazil, at an ob
servatory surrounded by what he de
scribes as a hot, humid banana planta
tion, Damineli said that coming to CU 
has enabled him to collaborate with other 
professors like Conti, who is famous for 
his studies of other binary stars.
Our universe has lots of surprises, 
and to learn something about science, 
one approach is to look at [those sur
prises]. It often leads you to new phys
ics, Conti said.
How eta Carinae survived the 1843 
explosion, which created its two dis
tinctive lobes, is anyones guess. The 
stars pass very close to each other in a 
cosmic game of chicken; in fact, the 
smaller star has even passed through 
the atmosphere of the larger.
Its still a mystery, Damineli admits. 
Eta Carinae was a notable star long be
fore its eruption in 1843. It was giving off 
bright hydrogen clouds as long as 4,000 
years ago when, astronomers believe, eta 
Carinae was called Ea by the Babylonians. 
According to legend, Ea was a man who 
came from the sea, turned into a star, and 
could communicate with mortal men. For 
all we know, he could  hes certainly

College Briefs
When told that Peter Deluca is a me
chanical engineering, economics, and 
business administration triple major in 
his third of five years of study, you might 
think that the last thing he would have 
the time or initiative to get involved in is 
politics. Especially since he goes to a 
school whose students are typically 
thought of as not very active politically.
But Deluca, chairman of the College 
Republicans (CR), manages to be an ac
tive political voice at CMU while still 
juggling three majors. The Tartan re
cently caught up with Deluca to talk to 
him about the recent flurry of Republi
can activity on campus and what it has 
meant to him both as a Republican and 
as the chair of CR.
The Tartan: So how did you originally 
become interested in politics?
Peter Deluca: I first became involved 
in politics in my senior year in high 
school. It was during the 1994 elections, 
and the Republicans had gained a lot of 
seats in the House and in the Senate. 
Something woke up in me, and I began 
to notice bias in the opinions of the 
students and teachers around me.
TT: So you basically saw a lot of 
Republicans winning and thought, 
Should I look in to what their philoso
phy is?
PD: Well, I had been sort of conserva
tive a couple of years before, but never 
really took an interest in politics until 
then. I figured, Why should I care?
When I came to CMU, I didnt 
see anything happening with CR 
my freshman year and was timid 
when I saw how liberal the cam
pus was as a whole. I still re
spected the opinions of liberals, 
but the magnitude of it all threw 
me off a little bit.
TT: There have been quite a few 
speakers on campus recently who 
have been inspirational to Repub
licans. Did any in particular stand 
out in your mind?
PD: I agreed with some of the 
things Colonel [Oliver] North 
said; it was nice to see The Phoe
nix bring a conservative speaker 
to campus, since we havent seen 
a whole lot of them.
TT: What are you looking for
ward to in the near future for CR?
PD: Id like to increase our 
activity and membership on 
campus, to let Republicans 
know theres a place for them 
to go and not be afraid to say 
theyre Republican.
TT: You spoke a couple of 
times about Republicans being 
timid or afraid to express 
their beliefs. Do you feel that 
the conservative voice is being 
stifled on this campus?
PD: Not so much being stifled as not 
being supported. A lot of conservative 
ideas are not receiving as much support 
as those of the other side.
Peter Deluca, chairman of the College Republicans, has 
worked to bring diversity to the political scene at CMU.
TT: How about the upcoming presi
dential race? Who do you think will win 
in the 2000 election?
PD: Ive heard Steve Forbes is one of 
the front runners. I support a lot of
what he talks about, and he 
seems to have a lot of support 
from Republicans.
TT: Is there anything in par
ticular that you like about him?
PD: I agree with a lot of his 
ideas, and he also seems like 
a great speaker. Im sure the 
media will point out his net 
worth and criticize it, but I 
hope people will look past 
that and see that he will be a 
good leader.
TT: What does it mean for 
you personally to be involved 
with CR, particulary to be 
the chair? What do you get 
out of it?
PD: I like to bring Republi
cans together on the Carnegie 
Mellon campus, to further Re
publican Values. I try to bring 
more diversity to this cam
pus by voicing Republicans 
ideas and values.
TT: How successful would 
you say CR has been in do
ing that this year?
PD: Given that in the spring 
of 97 we were dying out, its 
been a great success so far. 
There havent been a huge 
number of events yet, but hopefully well 
bring in a few more speakers in the near 
future and bring a few more members 
into the club.

Programs foster 
new connections
CONNECT, from page LI
through a program called 
Voices of Experience. Accord
ing to Karen Litzinger, associ
ate director of the Career Cen
ter, the goal of the program is to 
let students get in contact with 
alumni volunteers who can give 
information and advice about 
their careers. A student can get 
in contact with an alumnus via 
a database. Right now, the da
tabase has almost 300 alumni 
volunteers. Only H&SS alums 
were listed at first, but this 
year, MCS has become the sec
ond college to have a signifi
cant number of volunteers who 
can help.
Interested students can ac
cess the database through the 
Web at http://www.as.cmu.edu/ 
career/home.litml, or they can 
go to the Career Center in the 
basement of Warner Hall.
Finally, there are some op
portunities to network with 
alumni through the Alumni As
sociation. Although the orga
nization is mainly involved
with alumni relations, they of
ten serve as the gateway for 
alumni who want to interact 
with students through their 
Outreach program.
A lot of [alumnis] interests 
[are] being with the students, 
and that can be very difficult at 
times, said Patty Maurer, as
sociate director for Outreach 
and Alumni Relations. Our job 
is taking the University to them 
since they cant get to us.
The alumni groups are divided 
into clans. Several of the clans 
participate in events that ben
efit current students. The Pitts
burgh Womens Clan, for ex
ample, holds an annual lun
cheon and sponsors a scholar
ship for female CMU students.
Every year, the Pittsburgh 
Clan also attends the benefit 
night of a drama production 
that raises money for drama 
seniors who would like to travel. 
This year, the entire audience 
of the benefit has been reserved 
for alumni who want to help 
fund the travels.
Alums offer expertise on life
SLICE, from page LI
job would be like.... I thought, 
Wouldnt it be nice if somebody 
who knew could help? 
I think the sessions [were] 
helpful, but the only problem... is 
that they [were] too short, said 
Felix Alvarez, a senior electrical 
and computer engineering (ECE) 
major. Alvarez said that in one of 
the sessions, the presenter had a 
list of various topics but only had 
time to cover a few of them.
There wasnt anything spe
cific that I was looking for, said 
Elif Konuk, an ECE senior. I 
was just interested in the finan
cial [and] office culture, which 
they covered.
Litzinger believes that Slice of 
Life is one of the most appreci
ated programs offered by the 
Career Center. These are practi
cal things that [students] know 
they need help with and the evalu
ations [of the program] are al
ways so positive, she said.
The organization for the Slice of 
Life Program began last August 
when SARC and the Career Cen
ter began generating topics for 
alumni to cover. While Manski 
did most of the planning on behalf 
of SARC, there were about ten
other SARC mem
bers who helped 
with public rela
tions. Manski was 
also in charge of 
writing letters to 
alumni to ask them 
to participate in 
Slice of Life.
I think almost 
all the alumni 
were really excited 
to be a part of it, 
said Manski.
Joe Orlowski, an 
83 industrial 
management 
alum who pre
sented a session 
called Dont Buy 
That Until Youve 
Heard This, was 
especially eager to 
participate be
cause of other re
cent experiences with CMU.
For my tenth reunion, the 
alumni office called me and asked 
me if I wanted to get involved, 
said Orlowski. All of a sudden, I 
got all of this school spirit.... I 
said, You know what? I went to a 
really good school. 
Orlowski explained that he

wished he had appreciated CMU 
more while he was a student 
here, and that it was not until he 
got out into the work force that 
he realized that CMU has such 
an impressive reputation.
Many alumni hope that stu
dents will not only realize that 
CMU provides them with a
wealth of resources, but that 
they will also find their own 
ways on the path to success.
Believe in yourself and make 
decisions based on what you 
think is right for you, said 
Ferguson. Take other peoples 
counsel, but in the end, make 
decisions based on what you 
want to do.Teaching becomes learning experience for H&SS graduate

the candidates go through a gru
eling five-week program to pre
pare them for teaching.
The interviewer kept saying, 
[Teaching] is the hardest thing 
youll ever do/  said Vollmar. 
Ive hiked across Spain and that 
was really hard. I left the inter
view thinking he was full of it.
The intensity of the program is 
not without its reasons, Vollmar 
said. If you do a mediocre job, its 
the kids who lose out. There are 
20 students who need me to get 
up and go to school every day.
Over the five-week summer 
program, which included actual 
teaching sessions, she and oth
ers were shown how to run a 
classroom  everything from per
fecting lesson plans to laying out 
classrooms to dealing with bath
room breaks and hand-raising.
When you think of the class
room, you never think of kids 
hanging from the ceiling or tak
ing over the pencil sharpener, 
she said.
Furthermore, the schools for

sources, and students often have 
personal difficulties outside of 
class. You might be the bright
est ray of sunshine these kids 
see all day, said Vollmar.
On her first day, Vollmar was
terrified. But, according to 
Vollmar, a veteran teacher who 
was beside her heard that 
Vollmar was from Teach for 
America and said, Oh, you guys 
are great; we love you guys.
Even though she is not certi
fied as a teacher, Vollmar can 
impact students in a positive way 
and shape them for the future. 
You have so much power as a 
teacher, she said. You have to 
be very careful.
Vollmar is still unsure what 
shell do after her two years are 
up, but leans towards staying in 
the education field.
You realize how important it 
is to have good people in those 
schools, said Vollmar. Thats why 
she begged the Teach for America 
national office to let her come to
CMU to recruit: to bring people 
who she felt were among the most 
dedicated and driven in their 
fields into the program.
Erica Brusselars, a senior math 
major, is awaiting the interview 
letter that will give her the chance 
to join Teach for Americas ranks. 
They give opportunity to people 
who are thinking about teaching 
and interested in underprivileged 
issues, she said.
The kids arent the only ones 
who benefit  so do the teachers. 
Its really an exercise in learn
ing about yourself, said Vollmar.

Volume 92, Issue 16The Tartan, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania9 February 1998
Movie sequel pays little homage to original version
Play creates Much 
Ado about modernity
By GREG MARCKS
Tartan Staffwriter
An opening title dedicates this 
film to John Belushi, Cab Calloway, 
and John Candy. I cant think of a 
greater insult to the lives of these 
three men than the travesty that is 
Blues Brothers 2000.
What: Blues Brothers 
2000
Director: John Landis 
. Universal
From the first shot, it was ap
parent that something had gone 
horribly wrong. The Blues Broth
ers possessed a style all its own; 
here the men who created it un
successfully try to imitate them
selves. Landis forgets how to di
rect, Aykroyd forgets how to act, 
and both men clearly forget how
to write since the lame excuse for 
a plot was the most insulting as
pect of this sequel.
While in the original, Aykroyd 
and Landis walked the fine line 
between clever and stupid suc
cessfully, here the film degener
ates into a series of ridiculous, 
unconnected sight gags and un
funny moments that leave loyal 
fans feeling angry and betrayed 
by Hollywood yet again.
And theres the rub. I knew 
this movie would suck, but I 
went anyway, out of respect for 
the original movie. But the mak
ers of this film had no respect 
for the original, or else a prod
uct of such low caliber could 
never have been made.
The only man I can respect is 
Jim Belushi, who, by his con
spicuous absence, must have re
fused large sums of money and 
forced the producers to cast the
less appropriate but obese enough 
John Goodman.
There are so many things 
wrong with this picture: the use 
of a child sidekick whose pres
ence can only be explained by a 
producers wish (leaving the op
tion for another sequel, in which 
case I should very well have to 
load a rifle and drive west), the 
boring, cheap set design, plot 
holes I could drive a truck

logue for Elwood Blues, whose 
coolness always derived from his 
relative silence, and last but cer

incorrect year of the title.
In one especially nauseating 
scene, the kid sidekick cheers up 
a despondent Elwood, who then 
delivers what is supposed to be a 
stirring monologue to The Band, 
comprised of all the same mem
bers, although some look a little
worse for wear after 18 
years. Here the only 
message in the film be

Interpreting Shakespeare for a 20thcentury audience has never been easy. 
Directors often take chances with the 
Bards work in order to lure in fans. 
Sometimes, as in Leonard Bernsteins 
West Side Story, the play is modern
ized and the words changed, so that only 
the basic plot line is the same. Other 
times, such as in Kenneth Brannaghs 
Hamlet, sticking methodically to the 
text, as well as the period, is the key to 
success. Recently, Baz Luhrmann found 
box office gold, and raised more than a 
few eyebrows, by taking fair Verona 
into the 20th century in his remake of 
Romeo and Juliet, while maintaining 
Shakespeares Elizabethan-era dialogue.
As soon as I saw the marbled walls and 
elevator doors which set the stage for 
Scotch and Sodas production of Much 
Ado About Nothing, I was sure I was 
about to witness something with which 
Kenneth Brannagh would be none too 
happy. And once I heard a character 
utter his first word of Old English prose, 
I knew full well that there would be no 
musical number. Director Virginia Bond 
instead decided on a Luhrmanesque 
approach to this comedy about the 
folly of romance.
After having just seen the production, 
I am left with only one question  why? 
Barring obvious setting and costume 
differences along with one allusion to 
Playboy, there seems to be no reason for
whimsical charm by Ben Emest-Jones, 
still trade witty barbs to hide their true 
feelings for one another, only they do so 
in suits instead of stockings. The method 
in which they learn of each others affec
tions, by way of overheard conversa
tions, seemed painfully out of date. If the 
setting were supposedly a business in
stitution in the 1990s, wouldnt a strate
gically placed laptop be more appropri
ate? The one conspicuously modem touch 
to these scenes, the aforementioned Play
boy reference, got more laughs from the 
audience than most of the other mate
rial combined.
Some so-called innovations missed the 
mark. The self-important head of secu
rity, Dogberry, a comic Cris Peterson, 
stayed in an Elizabethan persona, rather 
than updating the role to that of a mod
ern law-enforcement officer. Partial mod
ernization struck again, as it is obvious 
that the procedures she goes through 
when placing two criminals under ar
rest were entirely out of date.
It is most unfortunate that some im
portant plot lines simply do not take 
well to modernization. For example, the 
aforementioned wedding of Hero and 
Claudio runs asunder because Claudio 
believes that Hero is, gasp, not a virgin! 
Sorry, but due to the diminishing num
ber of young women who remain virgins 
until their wedding night, it has been a 
while since wearing white to a wedding 
has been anything more than a 
fashion statement.
I hardly mean to make it sound as

updating this play. This is not to say 
that all attempts at modernization fall 
flat. The original tale centers around 
one king, Don Pedro, who arranges a 
marriage between his love-struck son, 
Claudio, and Hero, the daughter of an
other king, Leonato. Bond has changed 
the story into one of two business mag
nates who hope the marriage will lead to 
a merger between companies, which is a 
clever idea. However, its about there 
that the creativity ends as, quite unfor
tunately, few further steps were taken 
to update the rest of the tale.
The lovebirds cousins, Beatrice, played 
by the very charismatic Christi Craig, 
and Benedick, portrayed with a sense of
though the performance was not enter
taining. Judging by theirreaction, many 
audience members were pleasantly sur
prised by the show.
People did laugh, and they had no 
reason not to. The scenery was well 
done, the cast was energetic, and the 
lines were spoken smoothly and with 
familiarity. Its, impossible to fully ex
amine the good points of the perfor
mance without being constantly dis
tracted by the overriding failed at
tempt at innovation. I cant help but 
wonder what might have been achieved 
had Shakespeares work simply been 
performed without this modern 
interpretation.
Valentines Day is next week. Not 
like its New Years Eve 1999, but 
do you have plans yet? Do you 
even have anyone to spend it 
with? Hell, do you even know 
what the whole day is all about?
In case you dont  heres the 
scoop. Valentines Day probably 
has its roots in the belief that 
birds, especially lovebirds, began 
mating (i.e., doin it) on Febru
ary 14. The date was probably 
chosen because it meshed well 
with the ancient Roman feast of 
Lupercalia. It was a celebration that 
took place every February 15inhonor 
of the Roman god Lupercus. They 
honored him so the big nasty wolves 
roaming around the outskirts of the city 
wouldnt eat unsuspecting citizens.
What makes this remotely loveydovey is that Lupercalia also involved 
name-drawing. On the eve of the festi
val, all the names of Roman girls were 
thrown into a hat, and Roman boys 
were to draw one name. Those two 
were then to be sweethearts for 
the year.
Valentines Day probably got its name 
from a priest named Valentine. Roman 
emperor Claudius II forbade his sol
diers to marry, because theyd prob
ably just stay home with their wives 
and make like a bunny and Thumper. 
But Valentine, giving a big middle fin
ger to the Roman fascist pigs, married 
the soldiers in secret (to other people, 
silly). Claudius imprisoned and killed 
poor Valentine on the eve of Lupercalia. 
So the Catholic Church made that day 
. a feast day-(until 1969, that is, when 
they dropped it).
So now you know why youre doing it. 
Regardless of whether or not youve got
Mark Adato/Tartan Art Co-Editor
you know, quality time. Theres the 
lake (very romantic) where you can 
take your sweetheart for some alone 
time. Or you can take off into the woods 
and do it Adam and Eve style. If youve 
ever seen Young Lady Chatterly, you 
will hope that it rains while you ex
plore the great outdoors.
For something even farther removed 
from campus (hint: outside world), the 
Pittsburgh Ballet Theater is giving a 
performance of Coppelia. Although 
their special Valentines Day perfor

the Benedum Theater downtown, this

Critic sinks acclaimed love story
CRITICAL EYE
By Alex Lewin
When the Oscar nominations are 
announced tomorrow morning, Titanic 
will, I expect, be nominated in most of 
the major categories, and its a shoe-in 
for the minor categories nobody cares 
about (best score, best cinematogra
phy, best editing). Other likely-to-benominated films include LA. Confi
dential, Amistad, and after winning 
big at the Golden Globes, As Good As 
It Gets.
But Id like to suggest a few new 
categories, and possible winners, for 
the Academy ballot, just to make things 
more interesting.
The Jonathan Hensleigh Award for 
Worst Dialogue: Named for the block
headed screenwriter of The Rock, The 
Saint, Die Hard with a Vengeance, 
and the upcoming Armageddon, which 
is sure to be a turkey, this prestigious 
award might have gone to Alien Res
urrection, which contains one of the 
worst lines ever written: I am not a 
man with whom it is wise to fuck, Ron 
Perlman shouts at Winona Ryder. But 
he is, strangely, a man for whom proper
use of prepositions is of great concern.
However, Alien Resurrection will have 
to feel honored just to be nominated, 
because the undisputable winner of this 
award is Titanic. Here are some of the 
more memorable lines: A womans heart 
is a deep ocean of secrets. A deep ocean 
of secrets? Who talks like that? Jack, 
this is where we first met! Yeah, we 
knew that, but thanks for pointing it 
out. Theyve got you trapped Rose, and 
if you dont break free, youre going to 
die. Then that fire that I love so about 
you, that fires going to bum out. No 
comment necessary.
The Independence Day Award for the 
Most Un-Special Special Effects: Chalk 
up another one for Titanic. Some of it 
looked pretty good when the ship was 
going down, but what about the scene 
when the ship was leaving port? Some
thing in the way the water lapped, or 
didnt lap against the hull as it left the 
port  it just didnt look right. And 
everyone in the lifeboats had digitized 
breath. Is this what $200 million 
buys you?
The Melanie Griffith Award for the 
Most Passive Female Character: Theres 
stiff competition here, with Charlize 
Theron in Devils Advocate as an obvious 
pick. All she does is sit around and 
whine the whole movie. But at least she 
takes some action at the end, stabbing 
herself in the throat with a shard of 
glass, putting herself and us out of our 
collective misery.
The winner, though, has to be Kate 
Winslet in Titanic. Not that theres 
anything wrong with her performance
 the blame here can, once again, be 
attributed to James Cameron. Winslets 
character, Rose, is the rope in a tug-ofwar between two men, not to mention 
her mother, whos pulling at the bad 
guys end. Any woman would run away 
with Jack (DiCaprio) in Roses miser
able situation. Luckily, hes there to 
stop her from killing herself and to take 
her virginity and, finally, to tell her 
what to do as the ships going down 
because hes been through this so many 
times before and shes too dim-witted 
to think for herself.
The Billy Zane Award for the Most 
Two-Dimensional Bad Guy: He was 
such an unbelievable jerk in Titanic 
that it didnt seem enough to just give 
him the award  he deserves to be its 
namesake, as well. Again, hes a good 
actor stuck with a lousy script. His 
character is so deplorable that you 
cant believe any mother would con
demn her daughter to life with this 
scumbag, no matter how dire their 
financial situation.
The Forrest Gump Award for the 
Years Most Overrated Picture: Well, 
what do you know. Its a Titanic sweep.

fessional writing major and movie buff

The city of Pittsburgh has never 
been especially well-known for 
producing musical talent. Almost 
no A-list bands (with the excep
tion of Rusted Root) have emerged 
from the citys music scene. Per
haps this would explain the an^ 
ticipation behind the release of 
local act Brownie Marys third 
studio album, Naked.
courtesy Blackbird Recording Company 
Brownie Mary, a Pittsburgh-based band, will release Naked on February 10.
Who: Brownie Mary 
What: Naked 
Company: Blackbird 
Records
The band built a loyal following 
with their first two independent 
releases, selling over 25,000 cop
ies, and is attempting to make a 
leap to national recognition with 
Naked, their major-label debut. 
While the album has a certain 
entertaining quality to it, it lacks 
the originality and sharp 
songwriting that leads to largescale success:
Brownie Marys songwriting 
team, guitarist Rich Jacques and 
lead vocalist Kelsey Barber, have 
created an upbeat, pop-rock 
sound that varies little from track 
to track.
Most of the songs feature a ki
netic rhythm with fairly basic 
guitar work and Barber explor
ing a facet of relationships. The 
material at the beginning of the
record is probably the best, with 
the energy-filled rock of the leadoff track Like I Really Do and 
the melodrama of Say You 
Want Me.
Barber spends the entire al
bum looking at relationships from 
different angles, and while many 
artists have walked that path 
before, her wordplay manages to 
keep things interesting. Some 
other highlights of the disc in
clude Ill Be the One, a worthy 
attempt at hard rock, and Blind
Obsession, a soulful, urgent 
piece. But after about the ninth 
song, the album seems to meld 
into one long song, nearly devoid 
of any hooks or anything for the 
listener to sink his or her teeth 
into. The band keeps on pushing 
the same formula, while the disc 
could have been improved sub
stantially if the songs had veered 
into new and more inventive 
directions.
However, Brownie Mary is cer
tainly not an incompetent act.
Their songs, while often less than 
stellar, nearly always are enough 
to keep a listeners attention. 
Their material is certainly not 
disagreeable, and never goes out 
of its way to be bad.
Yet the album simply doesnt 
turn enough creative corners to 
sustain its 50-minute-plus 
length. I think Barber hits the 
nail on the head when she sings, 
Stop me if youve heard this one 
before. I think that most listen
ers have.

Be Here Now, Michael 
Grothusens new show at 
the Hewlett Gallery, con
sists of only two structures. 
In this case, two is enough.
What I do is like 
alchemy. I deal with 
transformation, said 
Grothusen at the open
ing last Thursday. 
Grothusens untitled 
works are made of com
mon, even banal, materi
als. Because they are so 
large, these commonplace 
materials are momentarily 
transformed into objects 
of beauty.
For example, the big 
pink wheel practically fills 
the anteroom of the gal
lery. The center of the 
wheel is approximately at 
eye level. The viewers 
vision, all the way out to 
the peripherals, is filled
Sophomore drama major Michael LiDondici observes the wheel of insulation, with endless spiraling
pink. It is like a cross-sec
tion of a great red- wood 
tree or a grindstone. This trans
formation is impressive, consid
ering that the wheel is relatively 
light, frequently swaying slowly 
as patrons enter and exit 
the gallery.
With the wheel in the Hewletts 
relatively small space, Grothusen 
forces the viewer to stand in close 
enough to experience the wheel 
tactily as well as visually. The 
insulation fiber stimulates an
other sense with its faint 
musty odor. The wheel is held 
together by plastic home siding.
All photos this page Hillary Carrey/Tartan Photo Staff

The implication is almost comic. 
It is as if the wheel were an in
sane variation of the well insu
lated, energy-efficient home.
The wheels size serves another 
purpose: it blocks the second room 
of the gallery. Once visitors walk 
around the wheel they are con
fronted with an equally enormous 
illuminated wall of blue air fil
ters that span the gallery in a 
graceful curve.
This exhibit is far more impres
sive at night, when the gallerys 
skylights dont wash out 
Grothusens light design.
The viewer reaches the final 
part of the journey by passing 
behind the blue wall, where they 
may discover that the walls are 
held up by steel cables hooked to 
glass water jugs.
The use of color in the wall is 
more appealing than in the 
wheel, though the green labels 
over the lips of the jars breakup 
the cool blue and silver feel of 
the space.
In an age of easy and inexpen
sive reproduction, a trip to the 
gallery or museum may seem a 
bit redundant. Grothusen has cre
ated works where effectiveness 
is-dependent upon the relation
ship among the viewer, the art, 
and the space.
Grothusens works are buoy
ant and novel. Still, they make 
evident the relationship between 
the viewer and the space.
Be Here Now will be displayed 
at the Hewlett Gallery in CFA 
until February 27.

Bands return deserves notice
Exhibit creates spatial chemistry
By DAVE ELMAN
Tartan Staffwriter
A few years ago, I was listening to the local 
college radio station and heard a catchy little 
number called Capsized. The band behind 
the song was Samiam, and I forgot about 
them until some time later, when I happened 
upon their CD, Clumsy, and bought it 
on impulse.
Who: Samiam
What: You Are Freaking Me Out 
Company: Ignition Records
Luckily for me, my instincts were correct 
for once. Although Im not an aficionado of 
pop-punk, their brand has just enough churn
ing guitar to keep me interested. Jason 
Beebouts vocals are more than adequate  
carrying the emotion of the more, anthemic 
numbers and providing able accompaniment 
when the tracks seesaw from angry to 
introspective.
But to get back to my story, it seemed that 
Samiam had fallen off the Earth since the 
release of Clumsy four years ago.
Fast forward to 1998 where they emerge 
with a new album, You Are Freaking Me Out 
, on a new label  Ignition Records. Freak
ing, actually their fifth full-length, picks up 
where they left off. With the band essentially 
unchanged  the sole exception being a 
change in drummers  its no surprise that 
they can still pump out songs like the opening 
Full On. Beebouts delivery initially is a bit 
deeper and slower, as if from a distant, 
drugged-out mindset, but then the 
chorus arrives.
The drums kick, the guitars threaten to 
saw us in half, and the vocals, for lack of 
better words, enter melodious drone mode. 
Highly satisfying, to say the least.
Unfortunately, the rest of the album seems
to concentrate on 
tunes that are a little 
slower than those on 
their previous effort. 
Not that theyre un
interesting; its just 
that none of them 
strikes me the way 
Capsized did with 
its blend of aching 
lyrics and slow 
buildup. The lyrics 
here revolve around 
loss in a myriad of 
forms: from the rela
tionship kind on My 
Convenience to the 
death kind on Mr. 
Walker and the fam
ily kind on Factory. 
Considering this, its 
an achievement that 
Freaking isnt a 
downer. Instead, for 
the most part the 
songs somehow 
achieve a synthesis of

You Are Freaking Me Out is Samiams first full release in four years.
indie-influenced introspection and soothing 
power chords.
One of the best tracks is If You Say So. It 
takes a guitar riff that, with a little distor
tion, might have been the basis for a metal 
track and uses it for a slow walk through the 
singers insecurities.
The instruments almost cry at points, and 
the drums keep prodding them along to en
sure that this never occurs. With lyrics like, 
Wonder if Ill ever get ahead/I wouldnt 
mind/its only fair, its a sure bet it wont be 
a party favorite.
Probably the most surprising cut is a cover 
of The Beatles Cry Baby Cry that, at least 
to my ears, sounds fairly similar to what The 
Beatles would have put out right down to the
vocals. I could see Samiam bursting into 
Eleanor Rigby any second (about the ex
tent of my Beatles knowledge). Granted, I 
dont think this version is really different 
from the original, but the band makes it fit 
into the albums framework.
The song that is typical of Freaking as a 
whole is Good Enough. Short with a fast 
tempo  it opens with a war between melo
dies out of which the faster survives. It makes 
you want to sing along and get out of your 
chair. At the same time it changes enough as 
it unfolds to never let things get boring. The 
vocals neither overpower nor are over
whelmed, but instead match the music per
fectly. Im sure youll be playing air guitar 
with it.... Well, maybe not.
