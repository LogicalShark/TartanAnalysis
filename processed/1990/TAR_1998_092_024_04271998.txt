FMS study opens door for basement project
By ELLEN BELDNER
Tartan News Editor
Scotland Yard was like Cheers  a 
place where everyone knew your name. 
But while the lights of Cheers went out 
forever in 1993, Carnegie Mellons 
former restaurant and hot spot will get 
a new lease on life as plans to renovate 
the Morewood Gardens basement pass 
another hurdle. With a near-completed 
Facilities Management Services (FMS) 
study in hand, a Student Government 
committee is ready to seek funding and 
search for a food vendor.
Were hoping to have it opened by 
this fall, said John Paul, senior me
chanical engineering major and chair
man of the committee. It depends on 
three things happening. First, it de
pends on whether we can get the 
money or not. Second, [it depends] on 
whether construction can be com
pleted in time, and finally, whether or 
not an outside vendor contract can be 
negotiated. Theyre all pretty big 
hurdles.... Id give it about a 50-50 
chance of opening by fall.
Plans to remodel the basement began 
last spring, when Dean of Student Af
fairs Michael Murphy gave the space to 
the CMU student body for student use. 
Student Body President Bryon Krug 
formed a committee to provide recom
mendations on what should be done 
with the basement, formerly occupied 
by the Carnegie Mellon Child Care 
Center. The committee recommended 
that the basement be transformed into
a Scotland Yard-like hangout, with 
smoking areas, dim lights, a stage, and 
dining facilities.
Last fall, Krug created a second com
mittee to actually implement the first 
committees recommendations. One of 
the first steps the committee had to 
take was getting the basement sur
veyed by FMS.
The FMS study, necessary to see 
what renovations would be needed to 
make the space conform to building 
codes, was originally scheduled for 
winter break. But due to confusion 
between the Child Care Center and 
the University about who actually 
owned the space, the FMS study was 
not completed until mid-March.
Based on the first FMS report, the 
committee made revisions to its plans; 
FMS recently resurveyed the basement 
in light of the new plans. Before pro
ceeding, the committee is waiting on the 
results of the second study, which should 
be available this week.
Committee member Sarah Gross re
ported that renovations are estimated 
to cost about $110,000.
Were looking at getting funds from 
Dean Murphy, SDC, Senate, and possi
bly loans that would be paid off with the 
vendor contract, said Gross during a 
presentation to Student Senate last 
Tuesday. The committee will approach 
community members and alumni for 
the antique furnishings with which hope 
to fill the basement; additionally, the 
committee plans on asking students to

SIA proposes laptop plan
By MICHELLE W. CHAO
Tartan Staffwriter
As if the students wandering around 
CMUs campus introducing themselves 
as their userids didnt indicate heavy 
CMU computer use, the School of Indus
trial Administration (SIA) introduced a 
standard laptop proposal last week that 
would make incoming first-year stu
dents in the Business Administration 
program more plugged in.
The policy, which was proposed by 
the Business Administration (BA) de
partment head John Hooker, would re
quire all BA students, beginning with 
next years first-year class, to have 
laptops for their classes and coursework.
Currently, the proposal would require 
students to purchase the computers, 
although the machines would be priced 
below market costs. The proposal also 
mentions the possibility of allowing stu
dents to rent the laptops.
Standard laptops would permit the 
BA program to design its own comput
ing environment and keep it up to date, 
said Hooker. We are the fifth-ranked 
undergraduate business program in the 
U.S., and we have a reputation for 
computer know-how. I believe standard 
laptops would help us to maintain or 
even improve this reputation.
Hooker proposed the laptop program 
to put the BA computing environment

Members of Carnegie Mellons Amnesty International club kidnapped H&SS Dean Peter Stearns last week for Operation 
Picnic. The kidnapping was staged to raise awareness for prisoners of consciousness across the globe.
Sarah Gross, left, and Will Toraason were elected 
student body president and vice president.
At last weeks Senate elections, 
a voter turnout of 1002 students
 twice as many as in recent years
 elected new Senators and the 
new executive board officers, stu
dent body president (SBP), vicepresident, and treasurer.
Sarah Gross, a sophomore 
double major in political science 
and social history, and Will 
Toraason, a junior physics major, 
beat out three other candidates 
for the presidential and vice-presi
dential offices. Write-in candidate 
Keith Rothschild, a junior electrical 
and computer engineering (ECE) 
major, won the position of Student 
Government treasurer.
Im very, very enthusiastic about 
my new position. And the new Senate 
is very excited to start next Thursday, 
said Gross. In general, [Toraason and 
I] would like to see an increase in 
pride and involvement on campus, 
interaction across the colleges,
Greeks interacting with non-Greeks. 
Gross has spent two-and-a-half semes
ters on Senate as the public relations 
chair and the campus affairs chair. This 
semester, Gross has sought student in
put and subsequently initiated improve
ments to the University Center, such as 
increased access to the building after 
midnight. But as SBP, she has wider 
concerns she plans to address.

Last Tuesday, the Commission on Ex
clusive Organizations (CEO) presented 
its fiscal policy recommendations at a 
special Senate meeting in a longanticipted announcement. The CEO, 
which has been meeting for two months, 
recommended that Senate allow fund
ing for exclusive organization-sponsored 
events on a case-by-case basis.
After Tuesdays discussion, the CEO 
made minor revisions to its suggested 
amendments and introduced the pro
posed changes at the regular Senate 
meeting last Thursday. Senate will vote 
on the series of changes at this 
Thursdays meeting.
I think that the proposal is very wellthought-out, said Bryon Krug, student 
body president and senior electrical and 
computer engineering major. It reflects 
the many, many hours that the Commis
sion put into it.
The new plan would allow non-funded 
organizations to receive Activits Fee 
monies for specific activities that have Charles Anthe, junior ECE major and member of the CEO, speaks at an April 2 Town

As in-tune as CMUs Philharmonic Or
chestra sounds to audiences from 
Carnegie Hall to the Kennedy Center, 
notes of discord resonate among its play
ers. Students and faculty alike have 
worked for the past decade to raise the 
school out of obscurity into national rec
ognition, yet despite their successes, ten
sions between students and the depart
ment have risen to an all-time high.
Student complaints include the fail
ure to distribute faculty course evalua
tions in the orchestra class, inappropri
ate hiring strategies of professional 
extras, and low morale, which students 
claim is a result of a rigorous profes
sionalism imposed at the expense of
students learning experience.
Of these practices, the hiring of extras 
would seem to be the least controversial. 
It is typical for university orchestras to 
occasionally fill vacant seats by employ
ing professional musicians, often termed 
ringers, on a concert-by-concert basis. 
But what is a rarity at most schools 
has become routine here. Of the 108 
members of the CMU Philharmonic
Orchestra, 26 are__________________
paid professionals.
Ive not known 
anywhere else to 
[hire ringers] as fre
quently as they do it 
here, said Marc 
Churchill, assistant 
orchestra manager 
and a graduate stu
dent in the School of 
Music. I dont think 
it would be uncom
mon for [the administration and the 
conductor] to say, Were not sure theres 
anybody who can play it  well just 
hire somebody. 
The administration has repeatedly 
overshot its budget for ringers. Accord
ing to various members of the depart
ment, between $10,000 and $13,000 is
spent on ringers per concert. Given that 
there are eight to 10 concerts per aca
demic year, this means potentially 
$80,000 to $130,000 could be put toward 
hired professionals annually.
But School of Music department head 
Ken Keeling said the target ringer bud
get of $35,000 per year was exceeded by 
only $7,000 to $8,000 last year.
Ringers are paid $65 per session, which

can be either a concert or rehearsal. In 
the past year, ringers have been asked 
to sit in on every rehearsal, a violation of 
the policy to hire ringers for no more 
than three rehearsals prior to a concert.

that ringers were sitting in on every

Mellon Bank rebuffs 
hostile merger bid
NEW YORK (AP) - The recent 
friendly wave of bank mergers showed 
signs of strain Wednesday, as Bank of 
New York Co. made a $22.6 billion 
hostile bid for Mellon Bank Corp. just 
months after talks between the two 
broke down.
Mellon, a Pittsburgh institution that 
helped finance Westinghouse and 
Bethlehem Steel, flatly said it is not 
for sale. A combination of the two 
would have branches stretching most 
of the length of the Eastern seaboard 
and concentrated in the mid-Atlantic.
I remain totally convinced, as I be
lieve you do, that combination of our 
two companies would make compel
ling business sense, Bank of New 
York chairman Thomas Renyi wrote 
Wednesday to Frank Cahouet, his 
counterpart at Mellon.
Cahouet quickly released his blunt 
rejection: We are not in negotiations 
with Bank of New York or anyone else. 
We are not interested in pursuing a 
transaction  we are not for sale. 
The implication in Renyis letter was 
that Bank of New York would not take 
the matter directly to Mellon share
holders if it was spurned again. 
Renyi said he was only interested 
in pursuing this transaction on a 
consensual basis.
But Bank of New York also began 
meetings with Mellons major share
holders and securities analysts. And 
both Bank of New York and Mellon are 
under considerable pressure to expand 
in order to keep up with the nations 
rapidly consolidating banking system.
Last week, Charlotte, N.C.-based 
NationsBank and SanFrancisco-based 
BankAmerica Corp. announced plans 
to combine into the nations first coastto-coastbank. The colossus, with $570 
billion in assets, also would be the 
biggest U.S. banking company.
On the same day, Banc One Corp., 
based in Columbus, Ohio, said it 
would merge with First Chicago 
NBD into a $240 billion midwestern 
powerhouse, the nations fifth-largest 
banking company.
The proposed Mellon Bank of New 
York Co. would have assets of about 
$104 billion, making it the eighthlargest banking company in the na
tion if the other three deals go through, 
said SNL Securities, a Charlottesville, 
Va.-based research firm.
Even as it was being turned down, 
Bank of New York was holding an 
impromptu meeting with about 100 
analysts and shareholders in New 
York. Thomas Hanley, a bank analyst 
at UBS Securities, said the conclave 
looked just like every other bank deal 
that we have witnessed over the last 
three weeks, except that the bride 
never showed up.
By the year 2002, Hanley has calcu
lated the combined company could be 
the most profitable bank in America, 
with a return on assets of 1.83 percent, 
well above than the industry average 
of 1.25 percent.
Hanley said the meeting was at
tended by some of Mellons largest 
stockholders, who were exuberant 
at being offered a premium over 
Mellons stock price.
Bank of New York said it would offer
1.4 shares of its stock for each Mellon 
share. That would be worth $89.25 a 
share, or 28 percent above Mellons clos
ing stock price Tuesday of $70 a share.
Mellon has been widely seen as a 
takeover target since dropping a 
friendly $18 billion bid last October 
for CoreStates Financial. CoreStates 
spurned the Pittsburgh company in 
favor of a deal with First Union Corp.
Despite the apparent attraction of 
the deal to Mellon stockholders, a hos
tile takeover would be difficult to pull 
off and is rare in the banking industry, 
Hanley said. The last hostile deal was 
Wells Fargo & Co.s 1996 takeover of 
First Interstate Bancorp, and Wells 
has had considerable problems 
integrating First Interstate into 
its business.
Corporate headquarters of the 
merged bank would be in Pittsburgh, 
while business operations would be 
centered in New York.
Group criticizes 
research schools
WASHINGTON (AP) - Big universi
ties too often neglect their undergradu
ates in favor of research, even though 
undergraduates pay a big share of the 
costs, says an independent report re
leased Monday.
Baccalaureate students are the sec
ond-class citizens who are allowed to pay 
taxes but are barred from voting, the 
guests atthe banquet who pay their share 
of the tab but are given leftovers, said 
the report from the Carnegie Foundation 
for the Advancement of Teaching.
The panel of scholars and some outsid
ers assembled by the nonprofit organi
zation found that undergraduate stu
dents are often taught by badly trained 
or untrained teaching assistants, not 
the famous professors touted in the cata
logs or recruiting materials, and many 
students graduate without a coherent 
body of knowledge.
Few have access to what distinguishes 
the research universities from 
liberal arts colleges: diverse, interdisc
iplinary opportunities for experiencebased education.
The report, ReinventingUndergraduate Education: A Blueprint for Americas 
Research Universities, said universi
ties should involve more undergradu
ates in those research projects, whether 
in medicine or the humanities, begin
ning with first-year students.
Research universities are distinc
tively different from small colleges, 
and they need to offer an experience 
that is a clear alternative to the college 
experience, the' report said, adding 
that a number of institutions have 
made changes.
Syracuse University, using a grant, 
helps develop teaching abilities of gradu
ate students. A program at the State 
University of New York at Stony Brook 
gives undergraduates the opportunity 
to work with faculty researchers and 
artists and at area laboratories, such as 
Brookhaven National Laboratory.
The universities mentioned as empha
sizing graduate education and research 
over undergraduate studies include 
Harvard University, the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology, the University 
of Alabama at Birmingham, and Kent 
State University. The 125 research in
stitutions in this country make up only
three percent of the institutions of higher 
learning, yet they award nearly a third 
of the bachelors degrees.
The report recommends that fresh
men be placed in small groups where 
they live together and take the same 
courses. It also says students should be 
involved in the research conducted by 
senior faculty and that they should be 
encouraged to conduct original research 
that could become their transition into 
graduate school.
Student shoots 
teacher at dance
EDINBORO, Penn. (AP)  A student 
shot and killed a teacher chaperoning 
an eighth-grade graduation dance and 
wounded three others before the ban
quet hall owner captured him outside, 
authorities said.
Andrew Wurst, a 14-year-old student 
at Parker Middle School was charged as 
an adult with criminal homicide. Penn
sylvania State Police say they still don't 
know what prompted a 14-year-old boy, 
nicknamed Satan by his classmates 
for his taste in clothing and music, to 
make the attack.
About 240 students had attended the 
dance with the theme, Ive Had the 
Time of My Life. Sobbing girls in satin 
dresses and terrified boys in neckties 
huddled together outside the hall after 
the shooting. Some hid in a closet when 
the shooting broke out.
Science teacher John Gillette, 48, was 
killed Friday night by a gunshot to the 
head. The dance was being held at Nicks 
Place, about two miles north of Edinboro, 
in northwest Pennsylvania. Edinboro is 
about 100 miles north of Pittsburgh.
State police said the boy was carrying 
a .25-caliber handgun and a small 
amount of marijuana.
Gillette was shot on a patio in the front 
of the hall, then the shooter walked 
inside and fired several shots before 
leaving through a rear exit, state police 
spokesman Mark Zaleski said.
Hall owner James Strand, armed with 
a shotgun, captured the boy in a field 
behind the building, Zaleski said.
The student had mentioned that he 
was going to make the dance memo
rable, an unidentified student told the 
Morning News of Erie.
Student Shane Rock said he saw the 
boy with the gun shoot another student.
I didnt see the shot but I heard it, and
then another, said Lucien Haury, an
other Parker student. About 10 or 12 of 
us then piled into a closet.
The shooting occurred just as the dance 
was breaking up about 10 pm.
Two 14-year-old boys were wounded by 
the gunfire and treated at Saint Vincent 
Health Center. One had an abdominal 
wound, the other had a leg wound, and 
both were treated and released, said Jane 
Sicker, a nursing supervisor.
A female teacher was grazed by a 
bullet and did not need medical treat
ment, authorities said.
The victim was a married father of 
three children who once coached high 
school football. In his youth he was a 
local high school football star and cham
pion discus thrower.
In vitro fertilzation 
yields quadruplets
SAN DIEGO (AP) - A 55-year-old 
woman who became pregnant by testtube fertilization has given birth to qua
druplets, making her possibly the oldest 
known person in the United States to 
deliver four babies at once.
The three girls and one boy remained 
in intensive care Thursday at Mary 
Birch Hospital for Women. One re
mained in critical condition. KFMB-TV 
reported that one of the babies weighed 
only 10 ounces.
At the womans request, the hospital 
refused to release her name. She gave 
birth on Saturday; the babies were two 
months premature and were delivered 
by cesarean section.
The unmarried woman underwent in 
vitro fertilization, in which an egg and 
sperm are combined in a lab dish and the 
fertilized egg is then transferred to the 
womans uterus.
Doctors routinely implant two to six 
embryos all at once to increase the 
chances that at least one will take hold. 
If more than one embryo takes hold, 
doctors offer the woman the opportunity 
to abort one or more.
The mother went to San Francisco for 
the in vitro fertilization procedure but 
delivered the babies in San Diego.
The number of multiple births in the 
United States has quadrupled since 
1971, according to National Center of 
Health Statistics. Experts attribute the 
increase to older women using fertility 
drugs and other reproductive technol
ogy, such as in vitro fertilization.
Windows 98 bombs first test while states seek to block its release
CHICAGO (AP) - Microsofts 
perfect tune-up for its widely 
used operating system needed a 
tune-up itself Monday: Windows 
98 crashed as Bill Gates provided 
a glimpse of its features at a com
puter trade show.
The system, scheduled to be 
released in June and retailing for 
about $89, collapsed when a 
Microsoft employee attempted to 
plug in a scanner, with his boss 
standing alongside. Gates 
was forced to move to another 
computer to complete his 
demonstration of the successor to 
Windows 95.
I guess we still have some bugs 
to work out, he noted ruefully.
That must be why were not ship
ping Windows 98 yet.
On another front, a dozen 
states reportedly plan to try to 
block Microsoft from its June 
shipment of Windows 98, the 
much-awaited update to the 
companys Windows 95 operat
ing system. The states plan to 
act within two weeks to halt ship
ments until they can hold hear
ings on Microsofts alleged anti
competitive practices, according 
to ZDNet, a high-tech online 
news service owned by Ziff-Davis 
Publishing Company.
Officials at attorneys generals 
offices in several states declined 
to comment.
The Wall Street Journal said 
Netscape turned down an offer 
from Microsoft that proposed to 
the then-fledgling corporation 
that they carve up the Internet 
browser market between them. 
Instead, Netscape went on to 
launch an initial public offering 
three months later, and Microsoft
 the dominant maker of com
puter operating software  cre
ated its own browser to compete.
It was like a visit by Don 
Corleone, Marc Andreessen, 
Netscapes chief technology of
ficer, was quoted by the newspa
per as saying. I expected to find 
a bloody computer monitor in my 
bed the next day.
Mark Murray, a Microsoft 
spokesman, denied the depiction 
of the meeting and said Microsoft 
instead discussed business op
portunities with Netscape. But 
he declined to elaborate.
If the Justice Department con
cludes that the talks were an at
tempt by Microsoft to use its mo
nopoly in operating software to 
neutralize a potential competi
tor, it would add a new element to 
allegations of anticompetitive be
havior by the Redmond, Wash
ington, software maker.
The Justice Department, 
which is considering a broader 
antitrust case against Microsoft, 
contends the software company
is using its Windows marketmuscle to foist its browser on 
customers unfairly, illegally 
squeezing other companies 
browsers out of the market.
Microsoft had been planning to 
debut the finished version of Win
dows 98 at the spring Comdex 
(Computer Dealers Expo), the 
first major computer trade show 
of the year.
But industry observers said the 
launch was delayed because of 
Tuesdays scheduled U.S. appeals 
court hearing in Washington in 
the Justice Departments anti
trust case against Microsoft.
Windows 98 will create a tighter 
bond between operating system
and browser, making it even more 
difficult for competitors.
Gates noted during the show 
that the worlds of personal com
puting, telephony and television 
are coming together.
He mentioned advances in the 
industry that allow computers to 
move faster and use a variety 
of external devices, including 
digital video disc technology, for 
which the Windows system is key.
Providing Windows is the plat
form for all of these advances to 
build on, he said.
He said Windows 98 will be far 
simpler to use than the popular 
Windows 95 version, which has 
150 million copies in use.

 Student Council publicly criti
cized Skibo for its prices, saying, 
prices are now sufficiently high 
to be instrumental in forcing stu
dents to leave the school for fi
nancial reasons, and causing 
many students to exist on an in
adequate diet.
President Doherty indicated 
interest in some of the portions 
of the report, but he said that 
any proposal to make changes 
before critical academic expan
sion was attempted would be 
sharply rejected.
25 YEARS AGO, April 24,1973
 Contrary to reports, Delta Upsilon decided not to close down. 
The eight remaining brothers, 
despite frustrating attempts to 
raise money and increase enroll
ment, said that they could not 
allow CMUs oldest fraternity to
disappear. They said that they 
were optimistic about making 
DU more attractive and in tune 
with what men at CMU were 
looking for.
We can be anything we want 
to be, said then-president of DU, 
Joe Goldman. Were the only fra
ternity that can say that.
Many factors contributed to 
DUs dwindling membership, in
cluding bad smells. The frater
nity was home to many pets, 
which in combination with the 
beer in the basement, made for a 
near-intolerable odor. Were hav
ing the place fumigated this sum
mer, said Goldman.
10 YEARS AGO,April26,1988 
 Returning Carnegie Mellon stu
dents were told to expect a mess 
when they came back for the 1988 
academic year. Construction was 
to begin on the Resnik and West
Wing dormitories over the sum
mer, and ground work was to start 
on the new Gesling Stadium.
FIVE YEARS AGO, April 26, 
1993  The demolition of Skibo 
Hall was delayed until December 
of1993, six months later than the 
expected date. The announce
ment came shortly after Student 
Senate passed a resolution ask
ing the administration to delay 
the buildings destruction until 
the Naval Reserve Center was 
available for student use.
JeffBolton, assistant vice presi
dent for Planning and Budgets, 
said that there were many rea
sons for the delay, including the 
availability of the Naval Center. 
He said, Weve received a lot of 
feedback from student organiza
tions about how disruptive it 
would be not to have that space 
available.
ONE YEAR AGO, April 28, 
1997  Groundbreaking ceremo
nies for the Purnell Center for 
theArts were held. PresidentRobert Mehrabian drove a bulldozer 
into a wall of the old garage that 
stood near Warner Hall last year 
to commerorate the event.
The Cut was filled with stu
dents and faculty who wanted to 
watch CMU history being made. 
A model of the completed build
ing was on display as well as a 
schema of the buildings relative 
location and phases in which it 
will be completed. Earlier in the 
week, an outline of where the 
building would sit was painted 
on the ground to further enhance 
the vision of what the Cut would 
look like in a few years when the 
building was completed.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  27 April 19983
Amidst controversy, School of Music pushes professionalism
MUSIC, from page 1
rehearsal until two weeks ago 
when it was brought to his atten
tion by a student. He contends 
that the practice will be discon
tinued.
Keeling attributed the over
spending to the fact that in cer
tain sections, such as the string 
section, there are not enough stu
dents to fill out the orchestra. 
There are only four viola students 
at CMU; a normal-sized orchestra 
requires 10 to 12 viola players.
In certain cases, though, ring
ers may be taking the place of 
capable student musicians. 
There are some good players here 
that never get to play principal 
[parts] because theyre hiring 
players, said Damien Bassman, 
a graduate student and percus
sionist in the orchestra.
For example, last semester the 
first oboist was a ringer, said 
Bassman. When the department 
had trouble hiring a principal 
oboist this semester, a student 
was allowed to audition for the 
part. The student now plays this 
position, and no ringers are nec
essary to fill the spot.
According to Bassman, the stu
dent should have been allowed to 
play sooner. This is a school  
not a professional orchestra, he 
said. In school youre supposed 
to learn, and theres no way to 
learn how to play principal un
less you get a chance to do it.
Students or professionals?
Students feel that ringers are 
hired in excess because conductor 
Juan Pablo Izquierdo lacks confi
dence in their abilities to perform 
competently. Izquierdo rarely ro
tates seats within the orchestra, so 
students only learn how to play 
one position. Many players see this 
as an example of how Izquierdo 
places professionalism over the 
educational needs of students.
When there is never rotation, 
people keep up their bad habits, 
said Susy Perelman, a graduate 
student, violinist, and concert 
master of the orchestra.
While students accept that 
many of the hired musicians are 
a necessary part of a functional 
orchestra, they complain that the 
ringers create a negative atmo
sphere. It becomes not our or
chestra  this is a bunch of hired
musicians, said Perelman.
The hope to have a studentonly orchestra seems unrealistic 
given the current status of re
cruitment in the music depart
ment. [Other music schools] are 
giving scholarships [to under
graduates]  we dont have schol
arships. We give financial aid, 
said Keeling. Its very much like 
athletics. Theres a tremendous 
amount of competition.
Many students wonder why the 
money spent on ringers is not spent 
on scholarships instead. It doesnt 
take that much arithmetic  
[$35,000] is not even two scholar
ships, said Keeling. Though he 
said no specific amount of money 
is budgeted toward recruiting, he 
estimated seven trips are taken 
out of town annually to audition 
undergraduate students.
Graduate students are more 
easily wooed to be in the orches
tra because the University has 
more to offer them  well over 
half receive full scholarships.
The people that are complain
ing have scholarships, said 
Andres Cardenes, professor of 
music and former conductor of 
the CMU Philharmonic Orches
tra. Cardenes is also the concert 
master and first violinist for the 
Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra.
If they stopped to think about 
the money spent on scholarships, 
theyd realize that the money spent 
on ringers is insignificant, he said.
A VICIOUS CYCLE
Cardenes said that the prob
lem was with students and that 
they should focus on their own 
work ethic instead of on the 
perceived shortcomings of 
the department.
I just conducted the orchestra 
three weeks ago, he said. My 
impression  a number of stu
dents showed minimal commit
ment to what they do. They came 
unprepared, kept talking, talked 
back, caused disruptions, and 
didnt do what they were asked. I 
never raised my voice, but I was 
very irritated.
My opinion is that commit
ment is something that is foreign 
to students of this generation, 
said Cardenes.
Bassman agrees that CMU stu
dents have a serious responsi
bility problem. Thats part of
the reason we have to hire ring
ers, he said.
Students on playing fellow
ships  which require them to 
play in the orchestra  fre
quently decline to live up to their 
obligation to perform. In one 
case, a student on a fellowship
that weve gone to Carnegie Hall, 
the Kennedy Center  weve put 
out CDs, said Cardenes. How 
many 18-year-olds can say theyve 
done that? Izquierdo prepares 
them for some of the best experi
ences in their lives.
Students have met the chalYou are dealing with faculty with 
very strong opinions.
 Ken KeelingSchool of Music 
department head
was hired as a ringer for a con
cert because the department was 
unable to find a professional.
Keeling called the hiring of the 
student absolutely inappropri
ate. It shouldnt happen. I can 
tell you that its against the policy 
completely, he said. I cant ex
plain why it happened, but it 
wont happen again.
The unreliability of some 
students results in a vicious cycle. 
[The conductor] says he expects 
us to be a professional organiza
tion, but he doesnt treat us 
like a professional organization, 
said Bassman.
Izquierdo does not post re
hearsal schedules until sometimes 
the day before the rehearsal, and 
he distributes sheet music the day 
of the rehearsal even though it is 
supposed to be ready two weeks 
before rehearsals start.
The way he conducts the 
orchestra ... is fine. The way 
he organizes the orchestra is 
terrible, said a member of the 
orchestra who preferred to 
remain anonymous.
When you manage an orches
tra of 100, you will have ques
tions and complaints. Thats nor
mal, said Izquierdo. He said that 
he was unaware of any criticism 
directed toward the orchestra 
class or the department.
They never came to me.... I am 
doing all these things for the stu
dents, he said. Izquierdo recently 
secured an invitation for his cur
rent orchestra class to tour in 
Europe and South America. In 
the past, the orchestra has per
formed in prestigious concert 
halls across the country.
The students have forgotten
lenges beautifully, but we gave 
them the opportunity, he said.
Stuudensornte pfioalt?e 
Although Cardenes said he 
finds student complaints to be 
legitimate, he questions their 
credibility. Its a mistake for stu
dents to challenge the authority 
of the faculty, he said. Students 
should have a voice at the appro
priate time and place. 
Traditionally, this time and 
place has been the faculty course 
evaluations (FCEs) distributed at 
the end of each semester. Yet, 
orchestra students have never 
received them, and consequently, 
Izquierdo has never been evaluated. This was brought to the at
tention of Keeling last fall. But at 
the end of the semester, FCEs 
were still not handed out.
Though Keeling has promised 
that FCEs will be distributed this 
semester, an anonymous source 
said students in the orchestra took 
matters into their own hands. The 
source said that students removed 
the FCEs from Izquierdos mail
box to ensure that they had the 
chance to submit them.
The lack of access to FCEs 
points to a larger problem within 
the department  insufficient 
communication between faculty 
and administration. A formalized 
system of checks and balances 
seems to be absent in the depart
mental hierarchy.
The department head is new 
and only wants to walk on egg
shells, said Perelman. Theres 
no liaison between administra
tion and faculty  students end 
up being that liaison.
The Music Student Govern
ment  a committee composed of 
graduate students  was re
vamped last year after a period of 
inactivity to address the commu
nication problem. Churchill is 
among the members. Were sup
posed to be the link between stu
dent concerns and the depart
ment head. What we serve as is
more of a buffer, he said.
Churchill said many student 
complaints go unaddressed,.  
sentiment Keeling said he un
derstands. But, Keeling sard} 
Academic situations are compli
cated ones. You are dealing with 
faculty with very strong opinions. 
You have to listen not only to the 
students, but to the faculty. 
With such world- renowned 
professors, students find it even; 
harder to be heard. The admin
istration has opted to take a 
laissez-faire attitude when deal-; 
ing with complaints against such 
a distinguished faculty. And 
many faculty members feel that 
students havent earned the right 
to be heard. When theyve ac
complished what weve accom-; 
plished, then their voice carries 
weight, said Cardenes. If we; 
were some podunk school in; 
Alaska then a mutiny would be 
okay  but not here.
We are a major music school; 
by any standard, said Keeling.; 
[Izquierdo] took [the orchestra] 
from almost a level of non-exist
ence to one of the finest student 
orchestras in the country.... That 
kind of progress would not be 
without some problems, some 
growing pains. We have different 
viewpoints on how we reach 
the same goal.

4The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  27 April 1998
Proposal recommends laptops
LAPTOPS, from page 1
on a par with that of the GSIA 
masters program (MSIA). The 
MSIA program adopted a laptop 
requirement for last falls en
tering class. If the undergradu
ates were required to have 
laptops, equivalent computing 
environments would allow 
GSIA to offer the same com
puter-oriented courses to un
dergraduates that they do to 
the MSIA students.
Laptops will greatly improve 
efficiency of IM students, since 
we do a lot of group work and 
presentations, said Lin Dai, a 
junior Business Administration 
major (the BA program was for
merly known as Industrial 
Management, or IM). I have 
one and it made my life a lot 
easier on numerous occasions. 
However, undergrads cant af
ford to buy decent laptops. It 
somehow seems like [GSIA is] 
increasing the tuition without 
labeling it as a tuition in
crease.... Long-term-wise, com
puters need to be upgraded ev
ery two years, three years at 
most, in order to keep up with 
the software. An incoming stu
dent might have to worry about 
upgrades and replacements in
their junior or senior year.
If students were required to 
purchase laptops, the cost of at
tending CMU would increase. 
However, Hooker said that cur
rent laptop prices are falling rap
idly and are moving closer to 
desktop prices. With this kind of 
price movement, it is impossible 
to predict the discount that CMU 
might get, although Hooker said 
in an email survey distributed to 
current BA students that it 
would be substantial.
The percentage of our students 
who buy computers anyway is in 
the high 70s, said Hooker. For 
these students, a standard laptop 
program is more a matter of coor
dinating purchases than requir
ing them. They may in fact save 
money, because we can get a good 
price.... A laptop can be a signifi
cant expense, however, to stu
dents who would not otherwise 
buy a computer, and a financial 
aid package must take this into 
account. I cant say at this point 
how it would be done. The CMU 
Admissions Office would make 
the decisions.
Despite the purported benefits 
of widespread laptop use* though, 
other IM students are concerned 
aboutthe proposals ramifications.
I think that this is a great idea 
but for wrong reasons, said 
Mark Stover, a junior IM major. 
It seems that this idea is for the 
good image of the BA program 
and for the benefit of saving 
clusters for classes. It doesnt 
seem to improve the quality of 
our education. Also, this pro
posal only benefits a limited 
number of classes such as Cal
culus, Information System, and 
Statistics. This also may put 
pressure on the students, as op
posed to GSIA.
The standard laptop pro
gram, Hooker said, will put all 
or most of the software BA stu
dents need easily at hand, 
eliminating the need to find a 
machine in the clusters. Over 
time, courses will begin to use 
laptops for in-class instruction. 
This requires classrooms that 
are equipped with network 
connections, but it will become 
easier for faculty to use 
software for teaching purposes 
and to try out innovative 
teaching ideas.
The masters program offers 
students a choice of three 
laptops, all from the same ven
dor but with different configu
rations and prices, said Hooker.

an explict benefit for the entire 
campus community. Additionally, 
it would disallow finding for 
events that primarily benefit 
members of those organizations 
and would disallow funding for 
organizational overhead  that 
is, for capital equipment such as 
computers or for expenses that 
arise from the organizations dayto-day activities.
For example, if it were de
cided that building a booth was 
an activity that could be funded, 
the organization could buy wood, 
but it couldnt go buy power 
tools, said Ben Kutler, senior 
social and decision science ma
jor and CEO chairman.
The CEOs proposal is based on 
a change in thought about the 
way organizations are funded on 
campus. Currently, student or
ganizations have one of two types 
of recognition: funded recognition 
(a yearly budget for operating 
expenses, events, and special 
costs) or non-funded recognition 
(which only allows the organiza
tions to use campus spaces). Nonmanipulate Senates rules to in
appropriately get funding. How
ever, the commissions plan ad
dressed this concern by using a 
reimbursement scheme as an 
organizations primary means of 
being funded.
[The CEOs proposal] reflects the 
many, many hours that the Commis
sion put into it.

funded recognition is typically 
given to organizations such as 
political groups so they may bring 
speakers to campus. Organiza
tions like fraternities are also not 
currently recognized by Senate.
The new plan permits eventbased funding, allowing both ex
clusive and non-funded organiza
tions the chance to host campuswide events without having to 
absorb the total cost of that event.
Several Senators at last

the logistics of funding events, 
raising concerns that exclusive 
organizations might be able to

The nine-member CEO first met 
on February 25. Since then, it has 
met with Dean of Student Affairs 
Mike Murphy, held two Town 
Meetings to gather student opin
ion, and spoken with the adminis
tration about the applicability of 
the Statement of Assurances 
(which prohibits discrimination on 
campus) to the funding of exclu
sive organizations.
According to Kutler, the Com
mission reached its decision by 
addressing the definition of an 
exclusive organization, defining 
the goals for its recommenda
tions, examining the Carnegie 
Mellon Statement of Assurances, 
and finally, debating the points 
that would comprise the 
committees final proposal.
I think that funding exclusive 
organizations is a very controversial.topic, and its always difficult 
to build consensus on such a con
troversial issue, said Krug. So, 
theres always the possibility that 
even though the proposal is very 
well-thought-out, it wont get twothirds of Senate to vote for it.
ELECTIONS, from page 1
Gross is adamant about keep
ing students informed about the 
ongoings of Student Senate and 
plans to do so with newsletters, 
email, and group forums. In addi
tion, she plans to form a commit
tee comprised of student organi
zation leaders to foster communi
cation between cam- -------------
pus groups. The com
mittee will encourage 
discussions about 
planned campus ac
tivities as well as keep 
leaders updated on 
Senate activities.
Im big on percep
tion, said Gross. Not 
just what is going on, 
but what [the stu-  " 
dents] think is going on. When 
things dont go our way, [the stu
dents] will understand why. By 
encouraging communication with 
the student body, Gross hopes 
that students will provide feed
back on campus activities and 
suggest changes.
Gross has several projects that 
she would like to complete over 
the next two semesters. For ex
ample,, she would like to see the 
Morewood basement open for stu
dent use next fall, have the ad
ministration complete renova
tions to Skibo Gym, get new ven
dors and operating hours in the 
UC, and expand Campus Xpress 
to off-campus stores. She also 
plans to continue Senates push 
for more online course informa
tion, so exam and project due 
dates will be available online in 
addition to'newly added Faculty 
Course Evaluation data.
Another change Gross would 
like is to have a more visible 
vice president. The vice presi
dential position was introduced 
only three years ago, and ac
cording to Bryon Krug, the cur
rent SBP and a senior ECE 
major, the role of the vice presi
dent was purposefully left 
vague in the constitution so that 
it can change to fit each vice 
presidents personality.
Im sort of the representativeat-large, said Toraason.
Toraason said that he and Gross 
have an excellent working rela
tionship. We both want to see 
people more happy, and we think 
the key to that is getting them 
more active, he said.
[Toraason] has a lot of deter
mination. Hes active on cam
pus, he knows a lot of people, 
and hes friendly, said Gross. 
With Will and I working to
gether, we can do twice as much 
as one person can do.
In an effort to increase student 
participation in campus events, 
Toraason would like to take a 
greater role in the Master Cal
endar project by serving as the 
liaison between CMUs adminis
tration and students. The calen
dar will list all University events 
on one online calendar to avoid 
scheduling conflicts between dif
ferent organizations and in
crease student participation in 
campus activities.
I think people get bored and 
they dont realize all the opportu
nities they have. [The calendar] is 
just going to languish if people 
arent aware of what a great tool it 
is, said Toraason.
Toraason also plans to write a 
letter to campus organizations, 
inviting them to take a greater
We both want to see people 
more happy... the key to that 
is getting them more active. 
 Will Toraason, student 
body vice-president elect
interest in Senate and to use 
Senate as a resource. I dont 
like email myself, said 
Toraason. I think picking up 
the phone and having a phone 
conversation with leaders will 
open up the flow of ideas.
In addition to increasing com
munications with campus lead
ers, Gross and Toraason are also 
eager to maintain a flow of ideas 
between the undergraduate and 
graduate students.
Although Gross supports the 
existence of the Graduate Stu
dent Assembly (GSA), formed last 
semester to give graduates their 
own representative body, she 
plans to encourage campus events 
that both groups will attend. I 
think thats important for a uni
fied campus, said Gross.
An issue that has recently di
vided the campus is funding for 
exclusive organizations. Gross 
and Toraason support the recent 
recommendation made by the 
Commission on Exclusive Orga
nizations (CEO) to fund campuswide events. There are exclusive 
organizations that can provide a 
service that can benefit every
one, said Gross.
While he agrees with the CEOs 
recommendation, Toraason 
thinks that as executive officers, 
he, Gross, and Rothschild should 
facilitate the decision-making 
process between the CEO and 
Senate rather than becoming di
rectly involved in the decision.
From a personal standpoint, I 
dont feel it is [Senates] role to 
fund exclusive organizations, but 
as a government representative, 
I dont think its my role to make 
that decision, said Toraason, who 
is also a member of Kappa Sigma 
and a midshipman in the 
Carnegie Mellon Navy ROTC.
As the new treasurer, 
Rothschild plans on taking an 
integral role with the CEO and 
event funding for exclusive orga
nizations. He also plans to pro
mote a gradual increase in the 
Activities Fee, up to $200 in up
coming years. Over the next year, 
he will work with various organi
zations to eliminate their finan
cial debts, continue to smooth out 
the glitches with the GSA transi
tion, and oversee the Joint Fund
ing Committee on budgets.
While his involvement with Sen
ate has increased, Rothschild said 
his involvement with his frater
nity has diminished. On Thurs
day night, the brothers of Alpha 
Epsilon Pi removed Rothschild 
from the house because of his poor 
attendance at house meetings and 
events. Because of my involve
ment in Senate, it caused me to
--------- stray away from the
house, said Rothschild. 
I still love the house a 
lot, but I wasnt going to 
lessen my activity in 
Student Government. 
Gross, Toraason, and 
Rothschild, currently 
three active members 
of Senate, will assume 
the top executive posimmm^m tions during this 
Thursdays meeting, when the 
current executive branch 
will step down, replacing Presi
dent Bryon Krug, Vice President 
Matt Phelps, and Treasurer 
Avinash Jain.
I think that during my two 
years as student body president, 
Student Government has been 
successful in taking on and 
completing projects that benefit 
the campus community, said 
Krug. I feel confident that 
[Gross] and [Toraason] have the 
ability to do an excellent job as 
student body president and vice 
president next year.

Thistles and Thorns
At the end of every school year, 
The Tartan presents Thistles and 
Thoms  a recap of the years 
best and worst moments, people, 
and events.
A Thistle to the University Aca
demic Calendar Committee for 
listening to students wishes at 
the Town Meeting and not chang
ing next years academic calen
dar. They showed their willing
ness to seek students opinions 
and act on them accordingly.
A Thistle to Online Registra
tion (OLR) for its implementation 
and its slight improvements from 
last semester. But a Thom to OLR 
for its ineffectiveness  slow sys
tem response, unclear informa
tion on waiting lists, and a con
siderable time increase in stu
dents registration time made 
OLR seem more like a hassle than 
a help.
A Thistle to Bryon Krug for be
ing an active student body presi
dent. He worked to get MLK Day 
recognized, instigated the in
crease of FCE information pub
lished online, and fought on be
half of students to maintain the 
current academic calendar.
A Thorn to CMU for not cancel
ling an entire day of classes for 
MLK Day. The administrations 
failure to recognize this revolu
tionary man with a full holiday is 
9 disgrace.
A Thistle to President Cohon, 
who had a hard act to follow. 
Through his community aware
ness and general approachability, he has met our expectations 
of an involved President.
A Thom to the GSA split from 
Student Senate, which only wid
ens the gap between graduates 
and undergraduates.
A Thom to the tuition hike since 
it is twice the 1997 rate of inflation.
A Thistle to the push for more

A Thom to yet another year 
without Beaux Arts Ball. This allnight event in CFA will soon be 
forgotten by the student body, as 
current seniors are the only ones 
who have directly experienced 
the event.
A Thom to the media figures 
who hounded Michael Lewinsky 
during the Monica Lewinsky 
frenzy. They exhibited poor jour
nalistic taste by disrespecting 
Lewinskys privacy.
A Thistle to campus improve
ments in fine arts, including great 
exhibitions at The Frame and the 
newly- added photography minor.
A Thorn to transportation prob
lems on campus, such as the scar
city of parking, the PAT buses 
that travel in herds on Forbes 
Avenue, and the lack of the Squir
rel Hill shuttle. As public trans
portation, PAT buses are sup
posed to be convenient, but they 
end up being a nuisance as they 
make students wait for 30 min
utes or more.
A Thistle to the organizations 
who brought great entertainment 
and speakers to campus: AB for 
They Might Be Giants and The 
Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, the 
College Republicans for Oliver 
North, WRCT for Fugazi.
A Thistle to the new 35mm pro
jector and Dolby sound system in
McConomy. AB and SDC made 
excellent use of them over the 
course of the year and provided a 
great way to unwind on campus.
A Thorn to the execution of the 
Wats:On? Festival again this year. 
That CFA students are given days 
off while non-CFA students are 
not has only increased divisive
ness between the colleges.
A Thorn to the defacement of a 
Wats:On? art exhibit. The action 
was immature and inconsiderate 
to the entire campus community.
A Thistle to the UAA Swimming 
Championships. It was superbly 
organized and brought in great 
publicity for the University.
A Thistle to the CMU swim team 
as well as the womens cross-coun
try team for their successful sea
sons. Their hard work has paid off 
for them and the University.
AThomtotheUC elevators. Their 
frequent malfunctions and slow 
speed do not properly serve the 
large amount of daily UC traffic.
A Thistle to El Nino for giving 
us a mild winter.'
A Thorn to the Office of Interna
tional Education and Career Cen
ter, whose inadequate resources 
still need to be expanded to suit 
an institution of Carnegie 
Mellons caliber.
A Thistle to The Small Under
graduate Research Grant 
program (SURG), as it received 
national recognition this year 
for continuing to provide 
CMU undergraduates with 
research opportunities that few 
universities offer.
A Thistle to the new CFA multimedia cluster, but a Thorn to 
Computing Services for still not 
providing enough cluster space 
for student needs. The applica
tion packet for CMU should be 
changed if it still reads that CMU 
has enough public computers for 
every student who needs one  
it doesnt.
A Thistle to the political hap
penings on campus such as an 
increased voter turnout at Sen
ate elections, events like Why is 
There No Democracy in America? 
and the referendum passage for 
the Student Activities fee in
crease. Such occurrences show 
increased political awareness on 
the part of the student body, a 
trend which is long overdue.
A Thom to the lack of progress 
on necessary Skibo Gym renova

need of repair, and the set of 
freeweights is disorganized.
A Thistle to the Technical Op

Business Opportunities Confer

H&SS Job Fair for its inadequate 
professional resources. The TOC

reputable companies who were 
enthusiastic about talking to stu

however, did not provide for all 
H&SS majors.
AThistle to Entropy Easts open

half-heartedly.
Finally, a Thistle to all the

Editor:
The article Waste 
chemicals cause explo
sion [4/20] brought an 
important issue to the 
attention of the cam
pus  namely chemical safety. I am the 
faculty supervisor of the laboratory in 
which the explosion occured. I wish to 
make two comments.
First, the student who was involved in 
the accident, Kristen Buehler, is a PhD 
candidate working under my supervi
sion. The article unfairly raised the issue 
of whether Buehler was acting respon
sibly when she mixed the two substances. 
Kristen was acting responsibly as she 
was executing my directive that the labo
ratory be rid of unwanted chemicals. She 
made a mistake in mixing the two liquids 
of unknown composition, one that many 
students would make, but she was not 
irresponsible. The fault for her mistake 
lies with me.
Second, we have learned some valu
able lessons for handling waste materi
als from an incident where there was no 
injury. The problem in this case was that 
the two containers of waste chemicals 
were left by students who had graduated 
several years ago. New rules for certify
ing that unwanted chemicals and wastes 
are properly disposed before a student 
graduates will be formulated and en
forced. In addition, we found that the 
presence of physical barriers between
student desks and chemical fume hoods 
reduces the potential for injury to stu
dents not working at the hood. Finally, 
the importance of proper labeling of 
chemical wastes is now obvious.
The faculty and administration are 
committed to providing the safest pos
sible environment for conducting experi
mental research. The accident in my labo
ratory drives home more emphatically 
the importance of this commitment.

Editor:
Heres a headline for 
you: The Tartan must 
improve poor attempts 
at editorializing. You 
all hide behind the 
editorial staff label: attacking, misrep
resenting, and complaining about issues 
on campus in a manner no different than 
any student randomly chatting to a friend 
could do. You have an excellent opportu
nity to act as campus leaders by using 
your editorials as a means to advocate 
constructive remedies to campus prob
lems and issues, and yet, you simply 
criticize (not constructively).
Case in point: The student body presi
dent debate I organized personally. I 
had never been involved with or had 
even seen such an event go on before, but
I decided to take on the task of planning 
the event. I wanted it to happen  I 
hoped it would give the student body 
every opportunity to meet the candi
dates and hear what they had to offer 
CMU. So, the debate may not have been 
on par with the JFK/Nixon debate  so 
what? Senate and I were taking active 
measures to involve more students in 
student government. Most people in
volved thought things went very well.
And so your editors saw a few prob
lems  sure, we all did [Senate must 
improve presidential debate, 4/20]. So 
why didnt you discuss the problems 
with me  the one who planned the 
event and invited you to cover it? I would 
have welcomed and appreciated con
structive criticism. I also would have 
expected any respectable journalist to 
speak to me before printing so defama
tory and baseless an editorial about me, 
Senate, and the student body president 
candidates. Unlike the superhuman staff 
of The Tartan, I make mistakes.
In short, your editorials, on the whole, 
are nothing more than petty tirades: I 
challenge you all to use your editorials 
as a forum for inciting students to take 
action, or to raise student awareness  
we can complain ourselves. If you are 
going to attack organizations and their 
individual members within your editori
als, at least have the decency to sign 
your name and take responsibility for 
the accusations you make. Accept criti
cism as freely as you give it.

Student SenateParty mischief ruins Carnival spirit
Jeff Thibert
Maybe next years Carni
val theme should be Week
end of Decadence or The 
Big Excuse. See, I had 
thought my first Carnival 
would be a pleasant week
end. We had an extra day off, 
so it would give me time to 
relax and to hang out with 
my friends, two things which 
havent happened quite as 
often this semester as I 
mightve liked. I figured I 
would get to know some 
people better, and it would 
probably be a lot of fun, since 
almost everyone would be in 
a good mood and there would 
be plenty of interesting things 
to do around here.
I shouldve known, how
ever, that I was almost alone 
in these hopes. Almost every 
time I heard Carnival men
tioned during the year, I 
didnt hear anyone talk about 
Buggy, Booth, the entertain
ment, or the rides. I heard 
plenty, though, about how 
drunk people were planning 
to get that weekend  about 
how they were going to spend 
the whole time wasted. They 
were looking forward to it 
because they felt that it was a
weekend where they could do 
what they wanted  drink 
themselves away from reality 
and not worry about life at all. 
It was almost as if they saw 
Carnival itself, along with all 
the events surrounding it, as 
something to keep them en
tertained until around 11 
pm, when the parties would 
kick into full swing, the 
drinks would start flowing, 
and the real entertainment 
would begin.
Needless to say, I became a 
bit jaded once I realized that 
there werent very many other 
people looking for my type of 
Carnival experience. Also, I 
got terribly bored, because it 
seemed that if you didnt want 
to drink or party, there was 
absolutely nothing for you to 
do after eleven.
So I caved and went to a 
couple of frat parties. They 
were my first ones, so that 
was a bit exciting, I suppose 
 I could finally say Id been. 
And its always good to experi
ence something before you ac
tually decide whether or not 
you like it. You never know, 
you might end up falling in 
love with something you 
thought youd detest. Well, I 
didnt fall in love, but I did do 
a lot of watching, pretending 
the whole time to be an awk
ward white guy on the 
dance floor. (I find that its a 
good cover, and I play the part 
so well.)
I had a good time dancing in 
my stunted, uncomfortable 
way, but when I looked around 
at everyone and really ob
served what was happening, 
everything seemed completely 
pointless. I heard pointless 
conversations and pointless 
music. I saw pointless drink
ing and pointless dancing.
But I thought about it a little 
more and realized that, para
doxically, the pointlessness 
was exactly the point. People 
submerge themselves in the 
meaninglessness in order to 
escape their unhappy reali
ties. I figured its either that, 
or that people just like to have 
fun, and drinking and danc
ing and not thinking is the 
best way they know how.
I dont mean to knock the 
idea of having fun, of course. 
And I certainly dont want to 
knock parties, mindless as 
they sometimes get. Most 
people do need to get mindless 
every once in a while.
However, I think Carnival 
gets lost in the mindlessness. 
Its almost as if the events and 
bands and booths and buggies 
arent really necessary, except 
to keep certain organizations
and certain people busy for a 
while. The administration 
could just give us a three-day 
weekend and tell us not to 
worry about anything. Throw 
in some parties, and wed have 
the same effect, without all 
this Carnival hoopla.
Now, Ill admit that Im be
ing a bit general. There are 
some aspects of Carnival that 
stand out for at least a few. I 
participated in the Scotch n 
Soda musical Assassins and 
had a wonderful time. I have 
friends who were involved in 
Buggy and found it reward
ing. Im involved with Kiltie 
Band, and although I didnt 
help out, they had a great 
time with their Blitz Booth. 
Yet, Im afraid these people 
are in the minority. Regard
less, Carnival is just a loose 
thread that ties these events 
together. It just happens to 
be the weekend when all these 
events fall. We could hold 
them any weekend, and 
people would find them just 
as rewarding and exciting. 
Carnival just makes it 
sound official.

flect, if even for a little bit.

Microsoft CEO incites high-tech debate
Computer giant should stay on top
Open Forum
__________by Dash Boyer-Olson
I want to beat the crap out of Bill 
Gates, reads one of the Web sites in the 
International Anti-Microsoft Web Ring. 
Microsoft, one of the most successful U. S. 
companies of the last 20 years, is about to 
introduce its Windows 98 operating sys
tem. While Microsoft has been successful, 
it has also been much maligned. The very 
existence of an Anti-Microsoft Web Ring 
shows that people love to bash both 
Microsoft and its CEO Bill Gates. The 
Justice Department recently joined the 
public lynching of Microsoft by investi
gating the company for antitrust viola
tions. Both these allegations against 
Microsoft and the intense dislike that is 
accorded Gates have left me puzzled.
Why do people hate Bill Gates and 
Microsoft so much? I would like to think 
there is a good reason, but it has not yet 
occurred to me. Maybe people find him too 
rich or successful. That doesnt seem to be 
an adequate reason, but people can have 
strange viewpoints. Others dislike Microsoft 
only because its the popular opinion.
In my experience, though, people who 
actually have a legitimate reason for dis
liking Microsoft feel that the software is 
sub-par. They also believe that Microsofts 
dominance in the software industry pre
vents other software companies from de
veloping better software. Some people, 
including those at the Justice Depart
ment, think that Microsoft abuses its domi
nance in the software industry by stifling 
competition from other companies.
Microsoft may or may not sell sub-par 
software. I am not an expert at evaluating 
software. I do believe that Microsofts soft
ware is good, though. Microsoft rose from 
nothing to defeat IBM and Apple in the 
'operating system industry. To defeat IBM, 
a company formerly at the head of the 
computing industry, it needed to have good 
products. The company certainly did not 
have the power to stifle competition from 
IBM; it simply had better products and 
made better business decisions. Microsoft 
has since established such outright domi
nance with regard to- operating systems 
because of the need for computers that can
communicate with one another. People 
needed operating systems that were com
patible with each other, so Microsofts 
systems gained tremendous market share 
as more people bought computers 
equipped with Windows so they could 
communicate with all of the other com
puters which used Windows. We should 
not punish Microsoft for winning fairly in 
the marketplace or for the nature of the 
software industry.
The Justice Department also has a prob
lem with Microsoft these days, as it is 
investigating the company for possible vio
lations of antitrust laws. Justice is con
cerned that Microsoft is discouraging com
petition by packaging its Web browser 
Internet Explorer with the Windows 95 
operating system and the upcoming Win
dows 98 operating system. This allegation 
is ridiculous  Microsoft should have the 
right to include whatever it wants with its 
operating system. Its not a stretch to think 
of a browser as being part of an operating 
system. And who is to define what consti
tutes an operating system? It definitely 
should not be 
the Justice De 
partment.
The Justice 
Department is 
looking for some 
type of wrongdo
ing by Microsoft

pany is so 
dominant, but

Unjust monopoly hurts consumers

Business leaders have never been known 
for being exceptionally nice people. Obvi
ously, you dont climb to the head of your 
industry by petting cute little puppy dogs 
and being nice to cute little corporate 
underdogs. But businesses do have a cer
tain responsibility to balance self-interest 
with the need to maintain a healthy busi
ness climate for everyone  producers 
and consumers alike. Businesses that use 
their top positions to unfairly try to grab 
ever-bigger chunks of their market de
serve criticism from consumers and regu
lation from the government. The Microsoft 
Corporation is just the latest example of 
corporate abuse of power. As Microsoft

not be punished merely for having a mo
nopoly. People hear the word monopoly 
and immediately, think the law is being 
broken. Microsoft may have a monopoly 
with its huge market share, but it at
tained it through legitimate business prac
tices, not through stifling competition, 
and it can legally continue to maintain 
one. Other software companies must beat 
Microsoft in the marketplace to reduce 
the companys power, just as Microsoft 
did to the formerly dominant IBM.
So as Windows 98 comes out, I urge 
people not to step Microsoft-bashing up 
to greater heights. Dont hate Microsoft 
because it is so powerful; remember, 
Microsoft rose from the bottom to reach 
its current position through sound busi
ness sense and quality products.

administration major. He welcomes all 
responsible replies to his column.
action, Microsofts monopolistic business 
practices are more relevant than ever.
Last December, the government found 
that Microsoft, whose operating systems 
are currently installed on nine out of 10 
personal computers, was unfairly pressing 
its advantage in the marketplace by bun
dling its Internet Explorer (IE) browser 
with its Windows 95 operating system. 
Other companies who mainly produce 
browsers have to sell them to most com
puter users, but Microsoft can give its brows
ers away free because it rakes in so much 
money. Netscape, which makes a popular 
browser, saw its share of Internet software 
sales plunge more than 20 percent in 1997 
because Microsofts browser was flooding 
the market. The Justice Departments an
titrust division argued the case against 
Microsoft before a federal judge, who or
dered that Microsoft allow computer ven
dors to sell copies of Windows without IE 
installed. Now Microsoft is appealing this
decision, arguingthatthisgovernmentregulation is unjustly impeding its right to oper
ate as it chooses. But if it were granted free 
reign, it would violate other companies right 
to fail* competition and consumers right to a 
fair choice of products.
Windows 98 should make the situation 
even worse. Its chief new feature is that 
the IE browser is completely integrated 
with its operating system. Microsoft is 
claiming that this means it wont even be 
able to offer copies of the new Windows 
without the browser installed.
Everyone loses when Microsoft abuses 
its position. Computer buyers lose as nonMicrosoft products suddenly become hard 
to find. Many veteran computer users dont 
like Windows, but since other companies 
have shrunk because of Microsofts aggres
sive tactics, its difficult to find Macintosh 
machines or others that use non-Windows 
operating systems. Many companies that 
make software have also stopped produc
ing software that works with systems other 
than Windows, partly because so many 
machines now are Windows-compatible and 
partly because of pressure from Microsoft 
itself. So even if you buy a computer that 
doesnt run Windows, Microsoft has made 
it much harder to actually use it.
Consumers lose as Microsoft realizes it 
can do all those fun things that monopolies 
get to do  raise prices, drop quality, and 
ignore such niceties as customer service. 
Other companies lose out as theyre put at an 
unfair disadvantage. The computer indus
try as a whole loses out without competition. 
If they dont need to worry about keeping one 
step ahead of the competition because there 
effectively is no competition, why should 
Microsoft develop better or more innovative 
products and technology? And if other com
panies know theyre in no position to get 
sales and their business has shrunk until 
they dont have much capital anyway, are 
they even going to try to make the kinds of 
technological strides that bring the industry 
forward? When it comes to computers, inno
vation is even more important than it is for 
most other products. Without someone to 
take technology to new heights, computers 
will become just a convenient way to put 
money in Bill Gates pockets while typing 
papers and playing cool games. In fact, Gates 
has already started a game of electronic 
Monopoly. Only thing is, everyone else is 
realizing they dont want to play anymore.

Abhay Agrawal
An education at CMU is expen
sive for anyone. But its worse for 
international students, to whom 
CMU offers no financial assis
tance of any sort, including fi
nancial aid and merit scholar
ships. To investigate the ratio
nale, or lack thereof, behind this 
University policy, I met with 
William Elliott, vice president of 
Enrollment Services. According 
 to him, the main reason that the 
University does not offer finan
cial assistance to international 
students is that it has limited 
funds that it wants to distribute 
only among U.S. residents. This 
is where the whole problem lies.
CMU is blocking out a certain 
group of people only because they 
are not from the U.S., ignoring 
their need for financial aid or 
merit for scholarships. I fail to 
understand why such a policy 
exists here. CMU talks about 
granting equal opportunity 
to everyone, then it makes poli
cies which clearly disallow such 
equal opportunity.
CMU denies foreign students 
any financial assistance, and 
shamelessly says so on its appli
cation for admission. Many uni
versities such as MIT, Princeton, 
and Harvard, just to name a few, 
do offer international students fi
nancial assistance. Im sure they 
also have limited funds like CMU. 
But they choose to distribute those 
funds to the people who need them
most (through financial aid) and 
the people who deserve them most 
(through merit scholarships). 
CMU doesnt care about the most 
important factors to be consid
ered when giving financial assis
tance  need and merit. It first 
looks at citizenship status and 
thus makes a grave error.
Another point Elliott made was 
that University scholarships are 
intended to attract students to 
CMU and not to reward perfor
mance once enrolled here. Thats 
all very well. But what kind of 
students is CMU trying to attract? 
Does CMU want to attract the 
most intelligent people or the most 
intelligent U.S. citizens? Any aca
demic institution should choose to 
attract the most intelligent people 
 American or non-American.
Picture this: You have an inter
national student who is incred
ibly smart. He gets into CMU as 
well as, say, Princeton. Princeton 
offers him aid because he needs 
or deserves it. When the student 
turns to CMU, he finds nothing. 
CMU offers him no aid  be
cause hes foreign. And lets say 
this student wanted to major in 
computer science. Its fairly cer
tain that such a student would be 
forced to pick Princeton over 
CMU, even though he might have 
preferred going to CMU because 
Princeton isnt as good for CS. 
CMU could be losing geniuses 
just because theyre foreign and 
picking not-so-smartU.S. citizens 
just because theyVefrom the U.S. 
If Elliott is satisfied with losing 
some of the brightest and sharp
est students, then all I can say is 
that its very disappointing for 
me, you, and everyone else who 
takes pride in being affiliated 
with CMU.
CMU has a reputation for se
lecting the very best students. 
Its crucial for it to live up to it. So 
it should strike down policies as 
frivolous as ones that dont take 
into account the relative need and 
merit of all students when award
ing financial aid. It is the respon
sibility of individuals like Elliott 
to rethink and reform such 
warped policies if CMU is to live 
up to the honor, integrity, and 
respect with which it is regarded.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  27 April 19989
teams should strive to sign lunatics, psychos!
Lifes a Sport
by Chris Cannon
! Pardon me, but I just killed a man. 
^frell, actually I just maimed him a little. 
All right, so it was just a flesh wound. 
Okay, I confess: Im no sociopath. Ive 
never given anybody a slash across the 
fiace that required 75 stitches to close. 
Im no Melvin Whitaker. But unlike me, 
litaker is a former McDonalds Allerican, and once he gets out of jail, 
$ou can count on the fire-eater to bring 
tyis fury back to th basketball court 
ext fall.
 Ive also never been arrested on as
sault charges, but then again, Ive never 
layed football with the other ruffians at 
ebraska. Choked my boss? Nope, not 
me. But Im not a raving mad all-star 
lliBA guard like Latrell Sprewell. Failed 
a drug test? Sorry to dissappoint, but Im 
no one-man wrecking crew like defen
sive end Warren Sapp.
J Wait, I see a pattern here: many of
societys most ill-bred 
madcaps also make the best 
sports stars. But why is this 
so? Lets explore the psyche 
of the sports psycho.
When the New York Gi
ants were at the top of the 
NFL, linebacker Lawerence 
Taylor would ask his team
mates on defense to go out 
there like a pack of wild 
dogs. Indeed, the Giants de
fense of the late 80s was at 
its best when all 11 players 
swarmed the field like un
tamed animals bereft of rea
son. For these naturally 
coarse and demented fire
brands, sports is" good 
therapy.
While the well-mannered 
athletes have to psych up 
their off-field, well-adjusted selves into 
competitors on the field, the sociopaths 
of sports have the luxury of going out 
and doing what they do best: wreaking 
havoc on a group of deranged beserkers 
like themselves. Gentlemanly and 
gentlewomanly contestants are under 
more pressure. If they dont get that 
.healthy stress relief during the game, 
then theyre pent up with frustration 
until the next contest. But the deranged 
lunatic of barbaric tendencies knows
The. Dr. So.ys m
allowed to hond/e. Glove Jl+ 
again! ^
I Am Th& dng
o-f- De.<xth'
Senior dictates hockey wish list
that if hes still wound up after the 
game, he can dish out some beat-downs 
at the local bar or (though more frowned 
upon) at home.
The hoodlums of the hardwood and 
their frenzied football counterparts are 
better suited to contact and collision 
sports. Theyve got practice at it. Whos 
more adept at sacking quarterbacks, 
setting hard picks, and generally run
ning for his life  the meanest prospect 
from the projects or the pretty-boy, pia
ano-playing prodigy 
with perfect atten
dance in prep school?
This isnt news; this 
is a recap. From the 
Dallas Cowboys of the 
early 90s to the Bad 
Boys of the Detroit 
Pistons champion
ship teams, its quite 
clear that unsound 
methods are some
times the best kind. 
The list of surly cham
pions is highlighted by 
Miamis college foot
ball teams and the 
L.A. Lakers of the 80s, 
whose players made 
headlines both on and 
off the court. 
Blum/Tartan Art Staff So if all this is true>
it baffles me when Randy Moss, perhaps 
the most talented receiver ever (com
plete with the hard exterior and poten
tial for pugnaciousness), has to watch 20 
players of lesser skill and capacity for 
carnage get selected before his name is 
called in the NFL draft.
Everybody loses his or her cool once in 
a while. Just last week, after being un
dercut on his way to the basket, Michael 
Jordan pegged Indiana Pacer Mark Jackson in the head with the basketball. The
difference is that a perceived first-class' 
individual, such as the Utah Jazzs Karl 
Malone (the concussion-delivering power, 
forward and wielder of wicked elbows)/, 
is more likely to have a higher degree of 
discretion than integrity.
So general managers of sports teams, 
hear my words. Dont avoid the 
overtalented and overgrown problem 
children, the fans and the FBIs mostwanted players, the despicable dregs of; 
society packaged with eye-popping; 
athleticism that humanity has to offer;; 
These uncouth ogres are the best hope; 
you have.
Rather, take a ticket out of the! 
netherworld of hopelessness and futil-J 
ity; stock up on superstars of diseased! 
morals. Make the offense out of players' 
well acquainted with (if not acquitted of)' 
numerous offenses. Make your team a' 
menace of manslaughterers. Only when 
every probation officer has been probed 
for prospects, when every convict has 
had his chance, and when every prison 
has been tapped for talent is the search 
for new stars complete.
Senior computer science major Chris! 
Cannon breaks the law. He hopes it will] 
help his jump shot. Thanks to The Tartan! 
for printing three years of propoganda.\ 
He likes public displays of affection, mo-j 
tion pictures, and palindromes.
REMANDS, from page 11

tihat there is nothing in nature 
dalled a bluejacket. Ill bet my 
autographed Bobby Orr picture 
on it.

club skates to another WPCHA 
(jhampionship. I always wanted 
ijo write that headline  it was a 
goal of mine for four years. My 
4dvice: Never stop skating, boys. 
These days that you have together 
dre short; enjoy them and go out 
very night on the ice leaving the 
tkrmoil of life and school behind, 
ill any Division I college and pro
fessional teams could use your
heart. Become the best team.
1+2. Anyone who has read my 
writing over the past few years 
knows what my top two wishes 
must be. I want the Bruins to win 
the Stanley Cup again, something 
they have not been able to do in 
my 22 years on this Earth. I want 
it soon. I want to rub it in 
everyones face. I want to go to 
the Hall of Fame in a few years 
and touch the Cup knowing that 
Ray Bourque got his only wish. 
Ive supported teams through 
AHL Championships, NCAA 
Championships, and New En
gland public high school hockey 
playoff runs (still the best
around), but I want a Bruins dy
nasty so bad it hurts. And no 
matter where in the world I end 
up after this place, I will feel that 
winning goal kiss the back ofthe 
net, get down on my knees, and 
praise God that Lord Stanley is 
coming back to Beantown.
Jessica Strelitz is a senior pro
fessional writing major who 
would like to remind everyone that 
if someday you findyourselfdrink
ing daiquiris before 7in the morn
ing or playing Truth or Dare in 
the back ofthe team bus, some
times being evil is so much more 
fun than being good.
Dont Cheat Yourself Out of an Education

"A CROWD-PLEASER 
IN THE BEST SENSE... 
AUDIENCES CHEER!"
USA TODAY
THE
by John Henry Redwood
A May-December romance blossoms when a middleaged spinster takes in a young boarder in this sweet 
and heartwarming slice of American life.
Set in a jumping, optimistic 1940s Harlem, this ruefully 
funny look at one woman's last flirtation with love is 
skillfully laced with sweet sorrow, wiy humor, and 
poetic flavor.

Columnist spells out lifetime list of hockey demands

On Net
by Jessica Strelitz
I have many hockey wishes, and by 
virtue of this being the last On Net of my 
life, I will finally share them with the 
hockey gods. My ultimate goal is to make 
an impact on the game I love, the players 
that play it, and the fans that worship it.
As Ive always said about hockey  its 
an obsession, but its pleasin. There is 
no game like it in the world, and I can 
only hope that the next writer who comes 
along after me can honor it like I do and 
always will.
And now the Graduation Wish List.
10. Old rinks. Let the new structures 
being built today  new Forums, Igloos, 
and Arenas  stand the test of time like 
the old Gardens and Centers. Build a 
rink with a sense of class, not the al
mighty dollar. Nostalgia is not found in 
luxury boxes and micro-brews, but in 
craning your neck around a partially 
obstructed view and sneaking down to 
the players exit for autographs. I miss 
seeing little rink rats scrambling all 
over the place begging for broken sticks 
and pucks.
9. No new rules just to increase scor
ing. So what if the goals per game aver
age is down? With the proposed imple
mentation of a fourth on-ice official, yank
ing the net all over the ice, and tying
Another year ends with 
mixed results for CMU
down the goalie, the league is just impos
ing artificial ways to change a problem 
which will inevitably work itself out ev
ery few years. The expansion teams that 
are coming in over the next three years 
will eventually weaken the defensive play 
that is dominating the league. People 
have become so impatient; just re
lax. A low-scoring game is usually a 
great game to watch because it is 
played between two, well-balanced 
squads. When officials do their job 
like they should have been all along, 
that is, to call the clutching and 
grabbing because it is illegal, it opens 
things up (and there are playoff 
games with scores like 8-3).
8. Salary Cap. I think that hockey 
should follow the lead of the other 
three major sports and implement 
one. When Paul Kariya held out for 
weeks for an extra million and a 
masseuse when he could have been 
helping the Mighty Ducks to the ex
tra points that would have helped 
them later when they were edged 
from the playoffs, I got mad. Hold
outs who wont take the gracious 
amounts of money that they are of
fered and exorbitant-salaried men 
like Hasek, Jagr, and Sakic continue 
to drive the dollar marks up. It is a 
sick game ofWho can get more this 
year? This must end. Just a few 
years ago, only the biggest stars had multi
million dollar contracts: Messier, Gretzky, 
and Lemiuex. And even those numbers 
were usually in the low single digits.
7. Bring back team rivalries. They 
have fallen victims of PC living and an 
over-reactive media. Flyers vs. Bruins, 
Bruins vs. Canadians, Penguins vs. Capi
tals, the intra-city hatred of New York,
and intra-state competition of Florida. 
The clawed hand of apathy has scooped 
down into fans and players hearts. No, it 
should not be just another game on a 
Sunday afternoon, people! When I was a 
little girl, I was raised to hate the Habs
Cory Shopper/Tartan Junior Staff 
and to rejoice when a player would go on 
television after a game and slam the other 
team to all hell. It is a healthy emotional 
experience. Paint your face when your 
favorite team comes to town. Make a nasty 
sign, and not just one that will get you on 
SportsCenter. Get pissed when your team 
loses, and then stalk around the next day, 
mad at everyone.
6. No more laser shows. Less hype, please. 
It pained me to see the players skate on the 
ice during the All-Star game this year to 
loud, thumping music and blinding lights. 
It was so minor league. I think that the best 
way to tell a player that hes made it to the 
Big Show is to  in between periods, in
stead of mascots jumping through flaming 
hoops  always have mini-mite game. 
When we see pure joy from little kids trying 
to play the game, on what must seem like 
the biggest pond theyve ever seen, th 
reasons why we started to love the game all 
come flooding back.
5. Down with true goons. I will always 
hate Ulf Samuelsson. When I was a fresh
man, everyone knew that the easiest way 
to get me fired up was to mention his 
name. Id go off. I still blame him for 
ending Cam Neelys career early. As Ulfie 
skates through life being dirty and loving 
the attention it brings him, other players 
follow suit in dangerous fashion. Rick 
Tochett was going for a record on suspen
sions this year, with his nasty, blatant 
attempts to injure. He would skate to
wards the penalty box smiling while the 
other guy would be writhing on the ice, or 
laying unconscious. That is not hockey; I 
dont care what anyone says. Raise the 
fines and suspend players indefinitely if 
they have a certain number of suspen
sions in a season. Being an NHLer doesnt 
mean that you can play without conse
quence. Breeding that kind of mentality 
does nothing but hurt the game and hurj; 
players. There is no respect in anyone whb 
calls himself Mr. Dirty.
4. Curb expansion until team owners 
can start coming up with cooler names. 
Who ever heard of doing historical re
search to name your team? The Columbus

to injuries. Junior Julie Balch, 
an All-UAA second-team selec
tion in 1996, teamed up with 
junior Whitney Brooks to form 
the second doubles team.
Outdoor Track
CMUs outdoor track team 
sprung into action a month ago 
when it hosted its regional invi
tational at Gesling Stadium. The 
team showed well and contin
ued to improve throughout the 
season as it neared the UAA 
championships in Atlanta where 
it will face tough competition.
At this point in the season, 
junior Maureen McGranaghan 
and senior Melissa Lott have 
already earned provisional 
qualifiers for the Division III 
national championships.
Both the mens and womens 
teams improved after the move 
from indoor competition to out
door competition, largely due to 
CMlFs lack of indoor facilities.
Volleyball
The volleyball team finished 
their season this fall beating 
NYU in the UAA tournament 
and ending up sixth overall in 
the conference.
It was quite an accomplish
ment, after the young team went 
0-18 during the first month 
of play..
The Tartans struggled during 
the absence of sophomore Steph 
Szobota, who was out for part of 
the season with ankle troubles, 
but rallied to grab second place 
in the CMU Tournament and 
several strong wins as the year 
progressed.
Their final record stood at 
9-25.

Recruiting lasts past seasons end
RECRUIT, from page 12
said womens volleyball coach Julia Webb.
For all of the coaches, recruiting is an uphill 
battle. They have to contend with other schools, 
Carnegie Mellons reputation as a challenging 
school, and the rising cost of tuition.
A few sports on campus dont need to visit 
athletes as much as teams do. With track 
and swimming, its a different game. If their 
verifiable times are good, then were after 
them, said director of athletics John Harvey.
Carnegie Mellon has to compete with Ivy 
League schools and other first-tier schools for 
players. In addition, the Division III University 
Athletic Association, which CMU belongs to, is 
one of the most competitive conferences in the 
country. Despite this, Carnegie Mellon coaches
only go out to sell a student on CMU, not to dissuade 
them from other schools. We dont do negative recruit
ing  talking down other schools, said Harvey.
The cycle repeates itself every year for the athletic 
department. Each year new athletes have to be brought 
in for teams to remain competitive.
If you slack off and have a bad year, it can hurt you 
down the road, said Lackner.
The pressure to find players is constant, and coaches 
must contend with ever-increasing competition among 
schools for athletes.
When I played soccer, very few top schools recruited 
 now its different, said Gaudioso. When you go to 
beat the bushes, other coaches have already been 
there. You have to sell the school. The kids that are 
interested because of a major or the school  they 
come to you.

Mens Basketball
The mens hoop squad finished 
another tough season this year 
under the leadership of coach Tony 
Wingen. The Tartans faced some 
of the toughest opponents in Divi
sion III from their own conferTartan File Photo

ence, the UAA. Overall the team 
finished with a record of 10-15, 
and a 4-10 record in the UAA.
Seniors Andy Sofish, Colin 
Shaunnessey, and LaDale 
Widmeyer provided leadership 
for the team through the season, 
and junior Tommy Praesel led 
the team in scoring. Praesel was 
honored for his efforts by being 
named to the UAA second team, 
and Sofish received honorable 
mention for his play.
The Tartans season was 
marked by strong home play and 
a poor road record, along with 
some blow-out losses to teams 
that CMU should have at least 
played closely.
Womens Basketball
The womens basketball team 
had a solid season this year, endingthe year 9-15 overall, and 3-11 
in the UAA. The season was marred 
by a nine-game losing streak from 
January 15 to February 13, which 
sent the teams UAA record into 
free-fall until it hit bottom at 1-10. 
However, the team rebounded, edg
ing out University of Chicago 42- 
41 for a hard-fought UAA win. The 
season ended with a phenomenal 
58-55 win over Emory University.
At the end of the season, head 
coach Geri Seidl said that she
was pleased with the teams 
record, although she had hoped 
that the team would be able to 
win 10 games this year. I could 
coach this team forever, she said. 
They are one of the most in
tense, fun groups Ive ever worked 
with.... They have a chemistry 
and desire and upbeat attitude 
about the game.
Cross Country
The womens cross country team 
turned in possibly the best season 
of any CMU team this year. How
ever, the Tartan men finished the 
hardship-plagued year in fifth 
place in the UAA.
However, the womens team 
brought a national rankings to 
CMU. I feel [the season] was a 
tremendous success, said 
womens coach Dario Donnatelli.
From the beginning, the 
womens team showed signs of 
greatness, finishing the regular 
season undefeated.
The UAA Championships were 
another obstacle in the fight for 
national recognition as the women 
turned in some of their best times 
of the season in Bostons Franklin 
Park. The men took third place.
As the autumn leaves began to 
turn, the cross country teams trav
eled to Dickinson to compete in the 
Regionals. The men took fifth, end
ing their season. The women 
stumbled for the first time, finish
ing third but still good enough to 
qualify for the Nationals.
At the Nationals, the womens 
season of hard work paid off. They 
fought through tough competition 
and horrible weather to capture a 
13th place ranking in the county
 the best finish of any Carnegie 
Mellon team this year.
Football
The football team is building a 
dynasty in the nineties. The team 
was carried by strong defense, 
special teams, and an offense 
highlighted by standout indi
vidual performances.
CMU started off strong with two 
straight wins againstDennison and 
rival Case Western Reserve. The 
first loss of the season came on 
September 20 at Grove City.
Golf
If there is a team that can be 
termed surprising, it is CMU Golf.
The team fought the forces of 
nature all season  from hail and 
snow flurries to lightning and 
wind. In fact, the teams only dis
appointing performance of the 
year was at the regional champi
onships where the first round was 
practically rained out, and the 
CMU teams settled for 14th place
Tartan File Photo
The football team finished the season 8-2, first place in the UAA.
Not to be discouraged, the team 
soon bounced back and won five of 
the next six, including two over
time victories. The most exciting 
game oftheyear was possibly CMUs 
homecoming match where a sea
son-high crowd of over 2,000 fans 
witnessed a 13-10 overtime thriller.
November was an opportunity 
for the team to pad its record. The 
team rolled over Rochester, 
Muhlenberg, and Bethany with a 
combined score of 91-27. The Tar
tans finished the season 8-2 over
all and 4-0 in the UAA, and took 
the top spot in the Association for 
the fourth straight year.
Tartan File Photo
The cross country women ran well enough to finish 13th in the nation.
of 15 on the first day. However, 
the team was able to rebound the 
second day and, led by senior Mike 
Kang, finished ninth overall.
This week the team hosts the 
UAA Championships. They hope 
to challenge powerhouses Emory 
and the University of Rochester.
Indoor Track
Indoor track is generally consid
ered at CMU to be more of a spring
board to other athletic seasons than 
a sport in itself. Nevertheless, the 
Tartans used this season to get 
ready forthe outdoor year  breakingseveral school records and turn
ing in many outstanding perfor
mances in the process.
In the UAA Finals in Chicago on 
March 5-6, the CMU team came 
into its own, and many athletes 
looked ready for the upcoming outdoor season. Junior Maureen 
McGranaghan broke a school 
record in the 3K and senior Jessica 
Connolly finished fifth in the 
womens long jump, beating an
other CMU record. In the end, the 
team finished second-to-last at the 
UAA Championships for the sec
ond straight year.
Mens Soccer
Carnegie Mellons mens soccer 
team completed another hardfought season in the UAA, one of 
Division Ills premiere soccer con
ferences. The team was led by 
senior Jason Buelow. He and 
sophomore Harry Ulrich formed 
the UAAs most potent and cre
ative pair of forwards.
Next year the teams starting 
core will return, minus Beulow, 
and will be one of the most expe
rienced teams CMU has fielded 
in the last few seasons.
Womens Soccer
The womens soccer team had a 
decent season, despite inexperi
enced players, injuries, and scoring 
troubles. The women finished their 
season with an overall record of 6- 
8-1 and a UAA mark of 2-4^1.
Injuries during the preseason 
made the first few games difficult 
to get through. Sophomore Romy 
Fisher was out with a knee injury, 
and other players faced physical 
ailments as well. The teams first 
game was the start of what would 
become an uphill battle, as they 
lost to Mount Union.
In the fourth game of the season, 
the women continued their losing 
streak with a 0-2 loss against the 
Alleghany College Gators.
However, the Tartans defensive 
moves were getting stronger, with 
excellent goal tending by junior 
Lindsay Smith. The team eventu
ally turned around to rack up sev
eral wins as the season progressed.
Swimming
In their second 
full year under the 
direction of head 
coach David Belowich, the CMU 
swimmers fin
ished with possibly 
the best all-around 
team in school 
history.
The mens team 
finished the regu
lar season with one 
of its best records 
in a decade, 8-2, 
highlighted by a 
victory over Divi
sion I Duquesne in 
the UC.
The Tartan women finished at 
.500 overall for the season  a 
feat that had never been accom
plished by a CMU womens team.
The UAA descended upon the 
University Center Feburary 19- 
21 as CMU hosted the UAA Cham
pionships for the first time. The 
CMU men captured third behind 
Emory and Johns Hopkins while 
the womenimproved over last year 
by finishing fifth. In addition to 
the team glory, senior Jake 
McGuire won UAA Swimmer of 
the Year, and the CMU coaching 
staff won Staff of the Year.
Several Tartans qualified for 
the Nationals. Six men and one 
woman capped off the incredible 
season with 16th and 41st place 
in the nation, respectively.
Tennis
The mens and womens tennis 
teams ended their season over the 
weekend at the UAA Champion
ships at Washington University, 
St. Louis. The men travel to the 
championships with a 10-7 record, 
while the women have gone 6-9. 
The mens team returned every 
member of last seasons thirdplace team  the best in school 
history among the returningmembers were the All-UAA combina
tion of Kothari and Bilco.
The womens team returned 
two-time All-American Keri Mills 
and first year student Elizabeth 
Brown to the roster after both 
were sidelined for the season due

Senior Jason Beulow led the men's soccer team.Baseball club loses doubleheader
By STACEY REED
Tartan Staffwriter
The baseball club played the Commu
nity College of Allegheny County at Boyce 
on Saturday, following a disappointing 
and tiring outing at Allegheny College 
on Thursday afternoon. The doubleheader ended in two CMU losses, but the 
players fought to the end, losing by only 
one run in each game. These games 
were two heartbreakers. We should have 
won both of them, said coach Bob Janeda.
Masters of the plate included juniors 
Ramon Poo and Jon Mayes, sophomore 
Matt Bostick, and first-year student 
Brian Rosinski. Poo was the man of the 
day with two singles, followed by Mayes 
and Bostick who also had two base hits, 
scoring both times. Rosinski had a single 
and a double.
Fielding particularly well were all 
three outfielders: Mayes in left, Poo in 
center, and junior Alex Skroupa in right. 
Bostick also showed hustle at third base.
Senior Jay McCormack pitched the 
first six innings, striking out three and 
giving up three runs. Junior Steve 
Nasty Wetter relieved at the bottom of 
the sixth, striking out three, but gave up 
four runs, forcing the game into extra 
innings. The opposition scored at the 
bottom of the eighth and the game ended 
with an 8-7 CMU loss.
The second game proved to be a real 
nail-biter with a tied score throughout 
the first four innings. Poo and Bostick 
had another good game at the plate, as 
did sophomore Russ Clay and junior 
Chris Schmitt. A couple of cameos were 
made by Wetter, first-year student Ryan 
Jackson, and sophomore Justin Peroli.
The baserunning award goes to Schmitt, 
who managed to steal home in the top of 
the seventh. About half way there I had 
second thoughts, he recalls.
The seventh inning was the most 
impressive the team had between the 
two games  there was an entire run 
of the batting order. Fifth-year senior 
Albie Fletcher, senior Phil Michalak, 
Wetter, Poo, and Schmitt all scored. 
The bats were cracking, possibly due 
to Fletchers rally hat, or maybe just a 
little pent up aggression.
Poo had some amazing catches in Cen
ter, and Schmitt made a single-handed 
double play, snagging a line drive and 
beating the runner back to first. Unfor
tunately, this was not enough defense to 
hold the other team, and the final was 
CMU 10, Boyce 11, dropping the teams 
record to 2-4.Varsity teams focus on recruitment
By NATHAN STEINWALD
Tartan Sports Co-Editor
There is no doubt its the toughest 
part of our job, said mens soccer head 
coach Nick Gaudioso. He wasnt talking 
about game preparation, player devel
opment, or even dealing with referees. 
Gaudioso, in a sentiment repeated by a 
number of varsity coaches at CMU, was 
instead referring to the year-round pro
cess of athlete recruitment.
Each year when a new wave of seniors 
leaves the school, a void is present on 
varsity teams who must find students 
who can compete athletically as well as 
academically at Carnegie Mellon.
Every team goes about recruiting differ
ently, based on the time of its season, its
need for students, and how high school 
level competition is organized.
Football recruits the largest number of 
athletes on campus and seems to go to the 
greatest lengths to find them. "With aca
demic standards the way that they are, we 
take a national approach, said head foot
ball coach Rich Lackner. When you look 
at the seniors in high school playing foot
ball, you have a large number, but when 
you look at the number that can also meet 
the standards of Carnegie Mellon, the 
number really goes down.
Player recruitment for the class of03 
has already begun with identification of 
players. Over the summer and through
out next season, the football staff will be 
calling players to try and interest them 
in the school.
Locating players takes time in itself. In 
order to do it, the school subscribes to a 
number of information services which 
give player profiles for students across 
the country. In addition to this, coaches 
review players tapes and interview them.
Other teams take a slightly different 
approach. Smaller teams that have the 
ability to see players in action rely more 
on first-hand experience rather than use 
outside services. Some coaches are able 
to see players compete in all-star tour
naments and regional championships. 
In addition to this, students who contact 
teams get looked at by coaches.

Crew squad debuts at Capitol Classic in DC
By BRIAN SMITH
Tartan Sports Co-Editor
The CMU crew club may have been 
row, row, rowing their boats last Sat
urday, April 18 at the Capitol Classic 
in Washington, D.C., but that is where 
the analogy breaks down. They didnt 
row gently down the stream, nor was 
life but a dream for these athletes.
Overall, we didnt do quite as well as we 
expected, said sophomore Erin Tocknell.
Nevertheless, the Tartan rowers 
turned in several solid performances in 
their debut regatta, particularly in the 
preliminary heats and eight-man races.
The mens novice boat took a con
vincing first place in their heat while 
the womens novice did not advance. 
The womens varsity finished second 
in their heat, and the men took third.
After the four-man preliminaries, 
the novice and varsity teams combined 
in the eight-man boat race, and both 
the womens and mens boat finished a 
strong second place overall.
Finals did not treat the CMU teams 
as well. We all did pretty well in the 
prelims, said Tocknell, but, since we 
had to do the eight-man race between 
the prelims and finals, we were a little 
worn out for the finals.
Weather was also a factor slowing 
down the rowers in the four-man finals. 
The wind picked up, the water got 
choppy, and the team had to row through 
white caps. These factors combined pre
vented the crew team from bringing 
home any medals, as the mens novice
boat finished a team-best third place 
despite an equipment failure. Both 
varsity teams finished the finals fourth.
The next regatta took place Satur
day, April 25. This time, Mother Na
ture cooperated. The weather was 
beautiful, the water was calm, and 
everybody rowed at their maximum 
effort, said Tocknell. It was a bit 
disappointing for so many athletes to 
miss medaling by mere feet, but it was 
still a good day.
The novice men won their prelimi
nary heat for the second week in a row. 
They also ended up being the only boat 
to medal, capturing second in the finals.
After the mens novice, the most exciting race ofthe day was the varsity mixed.; 
eight. The team got a slow start because 
they were unable to hear the referees 
start. Most humorous, however may 
have been the that the teams 65, 200- 
pound coach Dean Taylor coxed the boat. 
Havingthe coach in the boat was prettyamusing, said Tocknell. He was just 
as just as worked up as we were  I 
dont think he stopped to take a breath 
once. The team was not able to recover 
from the slow start and ended up taking 
fourth by a few feet.
In other boats, the novice women 
finished sixth in their heat, partially 
because of equipment failure, and did 
not advance. Both the varsity men and 
women took fourth in the finals, yet 
again eluding medals by only one place.
The teams final regatta is next week
end in Fairfax County, Virginia, at the 
Mid-Atlantic Sprints.

Peak season brings diverse music festivals
By ANNE RAY
Tartan Diversions Editor
Garcia and Weir, along with the rest of 
the Grateful Dead, took their band to 
cities and towns across the country for 
more than 20 years, and Joplin did it by 
train. Now, Phish and the Dave 
Matthews Band have taken over the 
throne as Kings of Touring. Tradition
ally, summertime is the peak season for 
touring. And this summer, there are 
plenty of bands vying for the same title, 
most of which will make a pass through 
Pittsburgh, and most likely through 
whichever city youll be spending your 
summer in.
All around the country, large-scale 
festivals, some of them roving, try to 
capture the same communal atmosphere 
boasted by concerts from bands such as 
DMB and Phish. In addition, hybrid 
festivals run the gamut of genres, from 
folk to punk. And, with the absence of 
the legendary Lollapalooza this sum
mer, the door is left open for smaller 
festivals to take the spotlight.
For example, the Warped tour bills
hard-core punk and rock bands, as well 
as a skateboarding competition. Like 
the larger Lollapalooza, the one-day fes
tival features a midway with other at
tractions, but is definitely not for the 
sedate concert-goer.
In past years, the HORDE Fest (Hori
zons of Rock Expanding Everywhere), 
the undertaking of Blues Traveler, has 
been one festival on the other end of the 
spectrum and one of many outlets for 
former Deadheads. Sporting headliners 
like the Allman Brothers Band and the 
Black Crowes, the home-grown, South
ern feel to the tour has attracted fans 
looking for a groovy atmosphere, with 
lots of room to dance and mellow specta
tors. This year, the HORDE Fest brings 
the Barenaked Ladies and Ben Harper 
to Pittsburghs Starlake Amphitheatre.
Bob Weir and Rob Wasserman of the 
Grateful Dead recognized the fact that 
many of their fans thrived off the con
stant traveling energy associated with 
their shows. So they created the Furthur 
Festival, reclaiming the distinct vibe of 
all-night jams and a trip through the 
musical spectrum. Featuring artists such
as the Black Crowes and Arlo Guthrie; 
Weir and Wasserman have again tapped 
into the energy of the endless gig, and 
the devoted fans that seem to accom
pany it.
The all-female Lilith Fair tour, which 
hits Pittsburgh on August 5, takes its 
slightly spiritual tone a bit over the 
edge this year, adding many hip hop 
and electronic-inspired acts, such as 
Queen Latifah, Missy Misdemeanor 
Elliot, and Beth Orton. From all its 
attention last summer, the mostly fe
male crowds will be expecting spec
tacular things from Sarah McLachlans 
ever-expanding project.
To contrast the vibe that McLachlan 
creates with such a distinctive lineup, 
Ozzy Osbourne is reviving the OzzFest 
this summer, with a host of other acts, 
such as Pantera, Coal Chamber, and 
Marilyn Manson. With two stages, the 
OzzFest will hit 21 cities.
Whether its as a punk or a hippie, you 
can hit any number of music festivals 
around the country this summer. And 
you can decide for yourself who deserves 
to rule the world of summer tours.
Events animate 
summer living
By EMILY LANDES
Tartan Staffwriter
So the bad news is that you failed all your finals 
and you need to go to summer school to make up 
the classes. Before you start to get worried about 
how you are going to handle yet another three 
months of Pittsburgh, heres the good news  each 
summer, Pittsburgh comes alive with so many 
festivals, concerts, sports events, and movies that 
you might not get a chance to study this time 
around, either.
Perhaps the most popular festival is the Regatta, 
which usually takes place at Point Park the week 
of August 1. A parade and fireworks commemorate 
the beginning of the festival, as does the Hot Air 
Balloon Classic, a balloon race that lasts the entire 
week. The main event at the Regatta is the Lighted 
Boat Parade, followed by the International Out
board Grand Prix. But the Regatta is much more 
than just a simple boat race, it is a city-wide 
cultural event, featuring street fairs, ethnic food 
booths, and numerous local musical acts. Its kind 
of hard to define what the Regatta is, said fresh
man chemistry major Tara Washlack, Its just 
like a bunch of wild crazy people.
From June 6 through 21, Point State Park is also 
home to another large cultural fair, the Three 
Rivers Arts Festival. In addition, there are many 
other smaller festivals taking place all over the city. 
The South Side Summer Street Spectacular, during 
the second week in July, is one example, as is the 
Squirrel Hill Happening the following week. In fact, 
its almost impossible to find an area of Pittsburgh 
that doesnt sport its own summer festival. Even 
Craig Street, just down the road from CMU, has one
 the South Craig Street Celebration.
 Most of these events feature some sort of musical 
guest, but the most popular Pittsburgh music fair 
is held in Market Square. Sponsored by WXDX 
105.9 FM, this festival is a series of free concerts 
that take place downtown in Market Square every 
Friday night all summer long. The Square is bar
ricaded off, and hundreds of people attend each 
week to listen to local bands.
Its really fun because there are a lot of people 
there, although there is a problem finding parking 
said Danielle Storm, a first-year professional and 
creative writing major. Once you find parking, just 
relax, hang out, and listen all night to music.
Summertime sporting events in Pittsburgh are 
no different than other times during the year, and 
parking may still be a problem. But seats at a 
Pirates game are relatively easy to get and are 
discounted on Wednesday evenings. Love golf but 
sick of Tiger Woods? Go see the Senior PGA Tour 
May 25 at the Quicksilver Golf Course. Even 
equestrian fans can find happiness this summer at 
the nationally-recognized Showjumping Fest in
Hartwood. And Jennerstown Speedway offers ex
citement for those interested in car racing.
There are also many opportunities to get in
volved in amateur sports. Pickup roller hockey and 
basketball games can be found at the Liberty School 
Playground in Shadyside. In addition, the Ohiopyle 
River provides an exhilarating experience for any
one interested in whitewater rafting, and Seven 
Springs has great hiking trails. Also, the Schenley 
ice rink, which is still open all summer long, pro
vides a chance to ice skate and escape the heat.
A chance to escape spending money can be found 
right next to campus on Flagstaff Hill. Every 
Wednesday and Sunday during the summer, the 
city brings an enormous drive-in screen onto the 
hill and shows movies for free. Wednesday nights 
typically show classic films, while Sundays are 
reserved for more contemporary fare.
If saving money isnt an issue, another opportu
nity to see movies in a drive-in atmosphere is at the 
Greater Pittsburgh 5 Drive-In, on Route 30 near 
North Versailles. Famous for double features, the 
Drive-In is a classic idea for a long night out.
But, even if you find yourself unable to attend 
any of the festivals, concerts, sporting events, or 
movies this summer, every Pittsburgher agrees 
that the Fourth of July Fireworks, also in Point 
State Park, simply cant be missed.
The Fourth of July celebration is the best, said 
Ryan Jackson, a first-year student in H&SS. [There 
are] none better anywhere. Everyone should spend 
at least one summer here. They wont soon forget it.

After two years as student body presi
dent, Bryon Krug, a senior electrical and 
computer engineering major, will offi
cially step down this Thursday. However, 
his term of office has not been without its 
moments: Recognition of Martin Luther 
King Day, revisions to faculty course evalu
ations, and an increase in the Activities 
Fee to support more student organiza
tions and their activities are among the 
milestones reached by Senate during this 
time. The Tartan caught up with him 
after last weeks elections to find out what 
he found most memorable about his time 
in office and what he saw in the future for 
Student Government.
The Tartan: How did you originally 
get involved in Student Government?
Bryon Krug: In the spring of my fresh
man year, there were only two people on 
the ballot for CIT. I got a bunch of my 
friends to vote for me  I was a write-in
 and I got eight votes, which was 
barely enough to fill a seat on Senate.
I sat through a semester of meetings 
and was disappointed with what Stu
dent Government was doing. There were 
a lot of issues to be addressed, and not 
much was really happening.
In the spring of my sophomore year, I 
ran for Academic Affairs chair because I 
wanted to do an investigation of textbook 
prices, which a lot of students thought 
were very high, and I also wanted to 
address the issue of Martin Luther King 
Day. As it turned out, we compared CMUs 
textbook prices to those of 13 other col
leges and universities, and found that 
CMUs textbooks were 3 percent cheaper 
than those at other schools.
TT: Would you have done anything dif
ferent these past four years?
BK: Nothing really jumps 
out as something Id have 
done differently.
During my first semester as 
student body president, Stu
dent Government could have 
taken on a few more projects 
that dealt with specific issues 
that affect campus. But I 
learned a lot that semester, 
and Ive been pleased with 
what Student Government 
has accomplished.
TT: What specifically did 
you learn that semester?
BK: I learned that what 
really matters to students is 
what Student Government 
does that directly affects 
them. Student Government 
can work on bylaws and other 
things, but if we do that all 
the time, we wont get to 
projects that really matter, 
such as things that affect 
students lives on campus.
TT: Looking back on your 
term, what do you see as 
your (or Senates) greatest 
accomplishment?
BK: Getting MLK Day rec
ognized as a half day of no 
classes by the University. It 
was something Student Government 
worked on for almost three years at 
different levels through the University, 
including Faculty Senate, the Calendar 
Committee, the Presidents Student 
Advisory Council, and the Graduate Stu
dent Assembly. s
I think that recognizing MLK Day is 
something the University should have 
done a long time ago for countless rea
sons, but I dont think it would have 
happened if Student Government hadnt 
initiated it.
Hillary Carey/Tartan Photo Staff 
Krug says that students pay attention to what Student Government 
is doing when its activities directly affect them.
TT: What do you think is the biggest 
issue that remains to be addressed by 
Student Government?
BK: The Morewood Basement project.
Its a space that was supposed to be 
made available to students last fall, 
but due to various problems from the 
Child Care Center and Facilities Man
agement Services (FMS), the project 
has been stalled for the last five 
months. Now that its able to move 
forward, Student Government needs 
to make sure the space is used so stu
dents can take advantage 
of it.
TT: What would you like 
to see done with that space?
BK: Id like it to turn into 
a student hangout  a 
place where people can go, 
have fun, and meet people 
outside their major. It 
would be great if people 
can have a hangout to play 
pool, to see comedians, to 
have bands play, and to 
just do the fun things that 
students on a college cam
pus should be able to do on 
a regular basis.
TT: What will you re
member best about CMU?
BK: The culture. The fact 
that people dont worry 
about where you come 
from, or who your parents 
are, or what kind of car you 
drive, just about who you 
are and what youre doing. 
The real status thing at 
CMU is how hard youre 
working  you hear people 
brag about how many allnighters they pull, and that 
sort of thing. Its really un
important, but it shows 
how much hard work is a part of the 
culture here.
TT: What advice do you have for the 
new president and vice-president?
BK: Work hard. Take on projects that 
will affect the quality of life on campus. 
Dont waste too much time worrying 
about whos doing what; just make sure 
that things get done. Make sure you 
keep the campus aware of what youre 
doing, and make sure you keep doing 
what students want.
And, of course, have fun.

Fiesta promises fun on last day of classes
By GREGORY NOFI
Tartan Staffwriter
If you are depressed about finishing 
your last class of the semester this Fri
day, you do not have to look far to feel 
better. You only have to go outside to 
find free games, free food, free music, 
and free movies. Its all part of the an
nual Fiesta de Primavera.
This years Fiesta de Primavera  
Party of Spring  will be held outside on 
the Cut and CFA lawn. At 4:30 pm, the 
food, inflatable toys, and music will be 
open for students to enjoy as they come 
out of their last classes.
The Fiesta de Primavera is basically 
a big, laid-back party. The theme of the 
day is that everything is free, said 
Dominic Falso, a junior physics major 
and co-chair of the event.
As part of the entertainment, there 
will be several big games similar to those 
in the UC Gym during Carnival. The 
games this year are air volleyball, hu
man foosball, a climbing wall, a velcro 
wall, and a human gyroscope where stu
dents can spin around in three concen
tric circles on their own power.
In previous Fiestas, organizers tried 
bringing in bands to perform concerts. 
This year the music will serve as a back
ground for the other activities.
The H&SS Student Advisory Coun
cil is responsible for providing the 
music. Steel Impressions, a 13-mem
ber steel drum band, will take the 
stage at 4:30 pm. They will play some 
calypso and jazz in addition to tradi
tional steel music.
When they are finished at 6:00 pm, 
there will be a drum circle while the next
band sets up. Anyone interested in play
ing the drums or doing some African 
dancing is invited to participate. After 
the drum circle, Liquid Evergreen, a 
four-member rock band, will take the 
stage at 6:30 pm.
Theyre an upbeat group with plenty 
of groove, said Rebecca Crivella, a sopho
more social and decision sciences major 
and member of the advisory council. 
Both bands are excellent and will add 
to the energy of Fiesta.
To satisfy the hunger that comes after 
a semester of classes, hamburgers, hot 
dogs, vegetarian items, chips, pretzels, 
watermelon, and ice cream sandwiches 
will be served. The planners of the Fi
esta are anticipating a big turnout of 
students for the food.
Last year we had enough food to serve 
1800 people, and that ran out in 45
minutes, said Falso. This year we have 
enough for about 2500 people.
Finally, at 9 pm, the movies will begin 
to play. They will be shown at the grassy 
ampitheater that overlooks the tennis 
courts. Good Will Hunting will be shown, 
followed by Big Top Pee-Wee at midnight.
This event is sponsored by several or
ganizations including SDC, AB, Student 
Senate, Student Activities, Student Life, 
Student Affairs, and the Office of the 
Provost. Support for the Fiesta is given 
by Dean Murphy, Alpha Phi Omega, 
Greek organizations, and many others.
We estimated 2,000 to 3,000 people 
attended last year. Were looking for 
more people to go, and we hope to have 
more graduate students, especially, said 
Falso. We would also love to see profes
sors and faculty to come out and mingle 
with everyone else.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  27 April 1998
Program presents opportunities to CMUs daughters
By JENNIFER TERRY
Tartan Staffwriter
Everyone remembers early adolescence 
as a difficult and confusing time, but re
search has shown that its probably even 
worse for girls than it is for boys, largely 
because of a serious drop in self-esteem in 
girls between the ages of 11 and 16.
In response to this research, the Ms. 
Foundation for Women began Take Our 
Daughters to Work Day in New York City 
in 1993. Because of its success, the pro
gram soon went nationwide. It has been 
a campus event at CMU for several years.
This year was bigger than ever, said 
Melissa Cicozi, assistant head ofthe School 
of Design and organizer ofthe event. Part 
of the reason was that we opened up an 
eighth track [for the girls to participate 
in.] Although it took more work, I believe 
it was worth it. We were able to accommo
date 15 more girls than last year.
Each girl started her day by accompany
ing her host  usually a parent or guard
ian who works at CMU  in his or her 
regular work environment. They worked 
together, and each daughter learned about 
what the host does and how its done. 
Then, the participants attended a catered 
luncheon in Rangos where they sawXavier 
the robot and heard guest speaker Maggie 
Forbes, director of the Pittsburgh 
Childrens Museum.
Weve gotten better at figuring out how 
to really talk to the girls at the luncheon, 
said Cicozi. Its taken us a while to figure 
out what kind of speaker really makes a 
difference to this age group. The speakers 
that appeal to the moms are not always 
the speakers the girls want to hear.
Forbes talked about her memories of 
what it was like being a girl facing scary 
or difficult situations and dealing with 
them. Its good for. them to see that 
someone as important as Maggie Forbes 
still gets scared sometimes, said Cicozi.
According to Cicozi, the inclusion of 
Xavier was part of an effort to provide 
more technical experiences for the girls.
We do evaluation sheets every 
year to get feedback from the 
girls and their hosts, she said. 
Theyve indicated in the past 
that we did not provide enough 
engineering and science choices, 
so this year we made an effort to 
add those to the tracks.
I really enjoy[ed] it, said 
Amanda Reese, a 14-year-old who 
was signed up for Track 4, which 
included programs on women in 
sports, a visit to a biophysics lab, 
and a presentation on foreign 
cultures. Ill probably get into 
genetics, she said when asked 
about her future plans.
Deborah Bailey, a database 
assistant in Enrollment Ser
vices, brought her 15-year-old daughter 
Tara to the luncheon. Rather than par
ticipate in one of the tracks provided, 
she opted for a unique opportunity of
fered by a friend who is a PhD candidate 
in the English department.

Day participants gather in Rangos Hall for lunch.
Because my daughter writes poems, 
they thought it would be interesting for 
her to sit in on some college English 
classes, said Deborah.
Tara did not seem as interested. Its

was helping prepare diplomas 
for graduation, she had looked 
up and said, I want one, Mom. 
Other programs available for 
the girls included a presenta
tion on startingnew businesses, 
a visit to a civil engineering lab, 
and an architectural program.
I think it gets better every 
year, said Cicozi. We keep 
learning from our mistakes, 
reading the evaluation 
sheets.... I never thought four 
years ago that we could have 
handled eight tracks, but we 
did, and we did it well. It al
lowed us to fit everybody in. 
I think Carnegie Mellon has so many 
different experiences to offer to the girls, it 
would be a shame to pass up this opportu
nity to teach, said Cicozi. Where else 
could girls be exposed to acting, writing, 
and building robots all on the same day?Event memorializes Holocaust victims
By RHONDA GILLESPIE
Tartan Staffwriter
Around noon last Thursday, a 
mother and her young daughter 
approached a table by the Fence. 
They quietly read a poem on the
place, and year of death for the 
children killed.
Daniella Topol, a CMU alum, 
organized the first reading four 
years ago. When she graduated 
two years ago, she asked 
Greenwald to take over.
Its so hard to think about so many 
young, innocent children [who] lost 
their lives for no reason.
 Jenny Good, fifth-year scholar
table, picked up one of the stick
ers that were available, nodded 
to the people sitting at the desks 
near the table, and walked away. 
As the two walked away, the 
young girl asked her mother 
what was going on. Well, the 
mother replied, a long time ago, 
in a place called Germany, there 
was a man named Adolf Hitler. 
As the two walked out of ear
shot, Marni Greenwald, a senior 
biology maj or responsible for this 
years Holocaust Commemora
tion, smiled, and excitedly 
pointed at the pair. You see, 
thats what its all about. Thats 
why were doing this.
Over 200 students, faculty, and 
individuals from CMU, the Uni
versity of Pittsburgh, Chatham 
College, and the Pittsburgh com
munity participated in a 24-hour 
reading of the names of the chil
dren who died in the Holocaust. 
This year, names of 15,000 of the 
1.5 million children were read at 
the Fence in recognition of Yom 
Hashoah, the day chosen to com
memorate the Holocaust.
It was shocking that, even 
though we were going to do this 
for 24 hours, we were only going 
to get to such a small portion of 
the names, said Jenny Good, a 
fifth-year senior majoring in En
glish and Spanish and a reader 
during the days event.
; Readers stood inside a tent on 
the Cut, reading the name, age,
Greenwald said she chose to fo
cus the readings on the children 
who died so that they cannot be 
viewed as just statistics.
At one point during the event, 
she said, a father read the names 
and death places of the children, 
while his seven-year-old son read 
the childrens ages and the years 
of their deaths. It was really 
powerful, she said.
It is difficult to fathom the 
magnitude of the loss  the in
telligence, the talent, the creativ
ity, she said. One truly has to 
wonder what could have been. 
She pointed out that the cure for 
AIDS or cancer, or any number of 
improvements to the world, could 
have come from the people who 
were killed in the Holocaust, but 
now well never know.
Its so hard to think about so 
many young, innocent children 
[who] lost their lives for no rea
son, said Good.
Next fall, Greenwald will begin 
medical school at the University 
of Pittsburgh, but the readings 
will not end, she said. Others will 
take over the responsibility.
For readers, its strong, be
cause the children actually have 
names. For people walking 
around, it has an impact, as well, 
she said. Its really solemn. No 
one is joking or playing hackeysack. Theres no music playing. 
Its a day of remembrance. You 
cant deny it.

Students raise money to fight AIDS
By SETH MANDEL
Tartan Personnel Manager
There are many ways in 
which people show their sup
port for important causes. Some 
spend their time and energy 
trying to help raise awareness 
of a problem. Others make ex
traordinary efforts to raise 
money to help bring about 
change. And some even make 
personal sacrifices to show their 
dedication and commitment to 
making a difference. This sum
mer, three CMU students will 
be doing all of these things as 
they participate in a 350-mile 
bike ride, known as the AIDS 
Ride, to help raise money for 
charities that help those living 
with HIV and AIDS.
On June 18, Koshiko DelaneyKarell, a senior civil and envi
ronmental engineering major, 
Ellen Gallerie, a sophomore civil
and environmental engineering 
major, and Kelly McPhee, a junior 
psychology major, will begin their 
four-day journey from Raleigh, 
North Carolina to Washington, 
D.C. In order to participate in this 
event, each ofthe 1,700 bicyclists 
that will be participating must 
raise at least $1,800 as part of an 
effort to collect over $4 million for 
AIDS causes in the Washington, 
D.C. area.
Gallerie pointed out, however, 
that this event is about more 
than just raising money. She said 
that as the second-largest killer 
of people between the ages of 18 
and 45, AIDS is of particular 
importance to college students 
and something that people need 
to know about. She hopes that 
the AIDS Ride will bring public
ity to this cause, educate people 
about its seriousness, and help 
break some of the stereotypes 
that exist about it.
For me, to have the opportu
nity to be part of a diverse group 
of thousands coming together to 
help people is incredible and 
something I know Ill never for
get, said Delaney-Karell, who 
participated in last years AIDS 
Ride as a crew member.
Although they do not consider 
themselves very athletic, these 
three women have already begun 
preparingthemselves for the ride. 
They are well aware that their 
journey will be an intense chal
lenge, both physically and men
tally, but they also feel that the 
trip will be well worth it. Once 
we get there, we will get that 
rush, and I think thats what will 
get us through it, said Gallerie.
People with AIDS suffer from 
an excruciatingly painful dis
ease, said McPhee. I believe by 
putting myself through this pain 
and difficulty, I am saying that 
Im willing to do this for [them].
The students also said that this. 
is an event where they can ac
tively do something that makes a 
huge impact. They hope their par
ticipation in this event will in
spire more people from CMU to 
get involved next year.
McPhee believes that partici
pation in such events is an impor
tant thing for college students to 
do. I think there is a stereotype 
of CMU as an apathetic place, 
she said. By going through this 
extraordinary event, we are say
ing that we are not apathetic and 1 
college students actually do care. 
McPhee made note of a quote 
from the AIDS Ride pamphlet that 
is very important to her. It reads: 
Theres something inside of you 
that has hope for the future. 
Although we all complain a lot,
I honestly believe that we have a 
hope that we can make the future 
a better place, said McPhee. And 
thats why I am doing this.

Volume 92, Issue 24The Tartan, Carnegie Mellon University. Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania27 April 1998
Art exhibit showcases Japanese printmaking
By BECKY A. COWSER
Tartan Editor-i.n-Ch.ief
They were all in awe  Manet, 
Jongkind, Millet, and every other Im
pressionist painter you can call to 
mind. And not over the swirling, pas
tel, oil-on-canvas concoctions they were 
famous for either. These masters fell 
in love with a different kind of art 
form, one as foreign in the 19th cen
tury as the land it came from  the 
Japanese woodblock print.
This semester, Chatham students 
have also been amazed by this legend
ary art movement. Theyve studied 
Japanese kabuki theater by research
ing and cataloging woodblock prints 
focused on Japanese kabuki actors and 
famous kabuki scenes. In conjunction 
with that class, the Carnegie Museum 
of Art is hosting Kabuki-e: The The
ater in Japanese Prints, a 21-print 
show that aspires to be a five-month 
tribute to Japanese culture, theater, 
and print making.
The Japanese woodblock prints that 
depict the kabuki theater are actually 
called ukiyo-e, which translates as The 
Floating World  a direct reference to 
the brothel and theater districts of 
17th and 19th century Japan. The 21 
ukiyo-e prints and accompanying ex
planations that make up the Carnegie 
show are huddled in the back of the 
Scaife Gallery in the Asian Art sec
tion. They take up little wall space, 
but the intimate, circular presenta
tion gives the viewer the feel of evolv
ing with the artists and the theater 
over time. None of the prints are very 
large  the art form observes strict 
size limitations  but the detail is 
crisp and intense, and exaggerated 
emotion is clearly the driving force 
behind the clarity of each piece.
The early prints in this show ob
serve simple structures and focus on 
the bold facial expressions of individual 
actors. The later prints reveal minutely 
detailed scenes of the kabuki drama 
as a whole, sometimes with two or 
three actors in one piece. Vibrant col
ors emerge in the prints toward the 
end of the collection, and more empha
sis is placed on describing the style of 
each particular kabuki drama rather 
than the style of the print maker. Not 
to say that information about the art 
form of Japanese woodblock print 
making isnt included in the descrip
tions of the pieces  it is just not as 
prominent in the later prints.
Chatham students prepared the 
shows documentation as a part of their 
class, and the exhibit is funded in part 
by Chatham College, the Office of Aca
demic Affairs, and Chatham Colleges 
Year of Japan Global Focus Program 
for 1997-1998. It is a small exhibit, 
and what it lacks in number of prints 
it makes up for in the depth of re
search. The show manages to convey a 
wealth of history about Japanese 
kabuki theater as well as provide strik
ing examples of why those crazy Im
pressionists fell head over heels for 
the Japanese woodblock print.

caust is a hoax, hires a Jewish lawyer, 
Abigail, to defend him against govern
ment charges that his preachings cause 
hate crimes. It is a question of free speech.
The premise is a perfect test of the 
first amendment of the Constitution, 
which promises us that free speech is a 
right of everyone  even those who say 
the things we dont want to hear. At 
first, this is the attitude with which 
Abigail (Joan Rosenfels) approaches the 
case. A witch hunt is a witch hunt, she 
says, even if he really is a witch.
But as the play proceeds, we watch 
Abigail walk the tenuous line between her 
beliefs as a lawyer and her beliefs as a 
Jew. Though she defends Cooper, she despiseshim. And what makes Cooper (mag
nificently playedby William Langan) truly 
frightening is that hes so damn convinc
ing. He is a fountain of historical fact and 
logical reinterpretation of those facts, and 
he presents it all in such a smooth, profes
sorial manner that you find yourself un
able to argue with him.
One of Sagals brilliant touches comes 
when Cooper explains his motives for 
his lifes work. He feels a lie has been 
perpetrated on the worlds population, 
and doesnt like to see ordinary people 
being taken advantage of; he wants to 
fight against injustice. Which is, after 
all, the very same reason Abigail be
came a lawyer, and its the reason she is 
defending Cooper.

The play is filled with nuances like 
this. You are always treading the moral 
middle-ground, and you are always ques
tioning something: your trust in history 
textbooks, your faith in the law, the 
difference between law and justice. In 
that respect, Denial is great theatre.
However, for much of the play the char
acters come off as political automatons, 
tools for Sagal to pit one belief against 
another. For a long time, we dont really 
get to know these people. Abigail is a 
Jewish lawyer, but why are we seeing 
this as her story? Couldnt this be hap
pening to any Jewish lawyer? We dont 
care about these specific characters; 
rather, we care about their dilemma.
For this reason, emotion is largely 
absent. Even the emotional climax of
the play  the revelation that one Holo
caust survivors famous tale of survival 
isnt entirely true, and his confrontation 
with the truth  is used as a plot device;.
The play is shown on a three-quarter 
thrust stage, but the staging, as di} 
rected by Jed Harris, seems more apjpropriate for a proscenium. If your$ 
not sitting in the center section, you 
may not see everything.
Which seems eerily appropriate giverji 
Denials subject matter: the murkiness 
of the past and the confusion of our 
beliefs as a result of the past. And 
whether you love Denial or hate it, youll 
never forget it.
Denial is playing at the City Theatre 
through May 10. For tickets call 431-CITY'.

Superdrag ???
Head Trip In Every Key Elektra
After the mild success of the single 
Sucked Out, from their debut album Re
gretfully Yours, Superdrag seemed destined 
to become a one-hit wonder. With the re
lease of the follow-up, Head. Trip in Every 
Key, that fate still seems likely. Thats not 
to say that Head Trip in Every Key is a bad 
album; it contains all sorts of peppy pop 
hooks like its predecessor, with some eclec
tic touches thrown in. Its not psychedelic 
as the title may suggest, but rather relent
lessly happy without becoming grating.
Superdrag may have lost a little bounce 
between discs, but a wide range of instru
ments, including horns, strings, piano, and 
an Indian vibe or two, enhance the jangly 
power-pop melodies. Lead singer and 
songwriter John Davis plays cheerfully 
along with the music, although his lyrics 
about lost opportunity and disappointment 
seem out of place at times. Occasionally, 
the band tries to throw in a few power 
chords, but they never take things too sericourtesy Elektra
ously. The best moments on Head Trip in Every 
Key are found in the CDs most complex tunes. 
The Art of Dying blends all sorts of sounds, 
including a hypnotic Indian-influenced riff and 
urgent vocals from Davis, to create the high
light of the album. Superdrags not going to 
become an A-list band on the strength of this 
new disc, but that doesnt mean they cant have 
fun trying. - ANDY FRANCIS
Tuscadero ??
My Way Or The Highway Elektra
Poor, poor Tuscadero. The Pink Album (1996) 
launched them through the roof of indie rock 
stardom and into Elektras hands. Their longawaited follow-up to their debut made me jump in 
anticipation, but for veteran fans, this is a huge 
disappointment.
The record, sadly enough, lacks all that made 
Tuscadero irresistible in the first place: the fun 
lyrics, the minimal instrumentation, and the 
hooky melodies that drove the songs.
My Way Or The Highway might as well be 
a Veruca Salt album; the vocals are drowned 
out by a steady stream of fuzz; the fun is 
suffocated by overproduction. Queen For A 
Day and Tiny Shiny Boyfriend have the 
potential to be charming, but it is obvious 
that Tuscadero spent too much time embel
lishing them, a bad decision for a band known 
for its minimalist charm.
Every other track blends together, and the 
excess of distortion makes this album a boring 
attempt at a Buzz Clip. Old fans, there is no 
Nancy Drew or Dime a Dozen on this one; 
Tuscadero has lost the sweetness that launched 
them into stardom.  PAULETTE POULETT

Keith Washingtons third album, KW, fea
tures strong vocals but little originality. 
Instead of using Washingtons vocal skilljs 
and the producers talent to create an albuiji 
with a style of its own, the record company 
has tried to make his sound the same ajs 
everyone elses.
The first two songs imitate uptempo R&iJ, 
but lack the innovative appeal of the tofc> 
hits. At first it seems like the album will 
continue this way, but when it focuses on the 
ballads that Washington is known for, you 
know he hasnt lost his touch.
Most of KWs ballads, while not as ricji 
as Washingtons first two albums lovj* 
songs, fit nicely into Washingtons mod
ernized style. You Let Me Down is ajs 
catchy as they get.

THIS IS A PAID ADVERTISEMENT
WHY CAPITALISM IS MORAL
If one wishes to advocate a free societythat is, capitalismone must 
realize that its indispensable foundation is the principle of individual rights. 
If one wishes to uphold individual rights, one must realize that capitalism is 
the only system that can uphold and protect them. And if one wishes to 
gauge the relationship of freedom to the goals of today's intellectuals, one 
may gauge it by the fact that the concept of individual rights is evaded, dis
torted, perverted and seldom discussed, most conspicuously seldom by the 
so-called "conservatives."
"Rights" are a moral conceptthe concept that provides a logical transi
tion from the principles guiding an individual's actions to the principles 
guiding his relationship with othersthe concept that preserves and pro
tects individual morality in a social contextthe link between the moral 
code of a man and the legal code of a society, between ethics and politics. 
Individual rights are the means of subordinating society to moral law.
Every political system is based on some code of ethics. The dominant 
ethics of mankind's history were variants of the altruist-collectivist doctrine 
which subordinated the individual to some higher authority, either mystical 
or social. Consequently, most political 
sys-tems were variants of the same stat
ist tyranny, differing only in degree, not 
in basic principle, limited only by the ac
cidents of tradition, of chaos, of bloody 
strife and periodic collapse. Under all 
such systems, morality was a code ap
plicable to the individual, but not to so
ciety. Society was placed outside the 
moral law, as its embodiment or source 
or exclusive interpreterand the incul
cation of self-sacrificial devotion to so
cial duty was regarded as the main pur
pose of ethics in man's earthly existence.
Since there is no such entity as "society," since society is only a number of 
individual men, this meant, in practice, that the rulers of
society were exempt from moral law; subject only to traditional rituals, 
they held total power and exacted blind obedienceon the implicit prin
ciple of: "The good is that which is good for society (or for the tribe, the race, 
the nation), and the ruler's edicts are its voice on earth."
This was true of all statist systems, un
der all variants of the altruist-collectivist ethics, mystical or social. "The 
Divine Right of Kings" summarizes the political theory of the first"Vox 
populi, vox dei" of the second. As witness: the theocracy of Egypt, with the 
Pharaoh as en embodied godthe unlimited majority rule or democracy of 
Athensthe welfare state run by the Emperors of Romethe Inquisition of 
the late Middle Agesthe absolute monarchy of Francethe welfare sate of 
Bismarck's Prussiathe gas chambers of Nazi Germanythe slaughterhouse 
of the Soviet Union.
All these political systems were expressions of the altruist-collectivist eth
icsand their common characteristic is the fact that society stood above the 
moral law, as an omnipotent, sovereign whim worshiper. Thus, politically, 
all these systems were variants of an amoral society.
The most profoundly revolutionary achievement of the United States of 
America was the subordination of society to moral law.
The principle of man's individual rights represented the extension of mo
rality into the social systemas a limitation on the power of the state, as 
man's protection against the brute force of the collective, as the subordina
tion of might to right. The United States was the first moral society in his
tory.
All previous systems had regarded man as a sacrificial means to the ends 
of others, and society as an end in itself. The United States regarded man as 
an end in himself, and society as a means to the peaceful, orderly, voluntary 
coexistence of individuals. All previous systems had held that man's life 
belongs to society, that society can dispose of him in any way it pleases, and 
that any freedom he enjoys is his only by favor, by the permission of society, 
which may be revoked at any time. The United States held that man's life is 
his by right (which means: by moral principle and by his nature), that a right 
is the property of an individual, that society as such has no rights, and that 
the only moral purpose of a government is the protection of individual rights.
A "right" is a moral principle defining and sanctioning man's freedom of 
action in a social context. There is only one fundamental right (all the others 
are its consequences or corollaries): a man's right to his own life. Life is a 
process of self-sustaining and self-generated action; the right to life means 
the right to engage in self-sustaining and self-generated actionwhich means: 
the freedom to take all the actions required by the nature of a rational being
THE UNITED STATES 
WAS THE FIRST MORAL 
SOCIETY IN HISTORY.
for the support, the furtherance, the fulfillment and the enjoyment of his 
own life. (Such is the meaning of the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of 
happiness.)
The concept of a "right" pertains only to actionspecifically, to freedom 
of action. It means freedom from physical compulsion, coercion or interfer
ence by other men.
Thus, for every individual, a right is the moral sanction of a positiveof 
his freedom to act on his own judgment, for his own goals, by his own vol
untary, uncoerced choice. As to his neighbors, his rights impose no obliga
tions on them except of a negative kind: to abstain from violating his rights.
The right to life is the source of all rightsand the right to property is 
their only implementation. Without property rights, no other rights are 
possible. Since man has to sustain his life by his own effort, the man who 
has no right to the product of his effort has no means to sustain his life. The 
man who produces while others dispose of his product, is a slave.
Bear in mind that the right to property is a right to an action, like all the 
others: it is not the right to an object, but to the action and the consequences
of producing or earning that object. It is 
not a guarantee that a man will earn any 
property, but only a guarantee that he 
will own it if he earns ita. It is the right 
to gain, to keep, to use and to dispose of 
material values.
The concept of individual rights is so 
new in human history that most men 
have not grasped it fully to this day. In 
accordance with the two theories of eth
ics, the mystical or the social, some men 
assert that rights are a gift of Godoth
ers, that rights are a gift of society. But, 
in fact, the source of rights is man's na
ture.
The Declaration of Independence stated that men "are endowed by 
their Creator with certain unalienable rights." Whether one believes that 
man is the product of a Creator or of nature, the issue of man's origin does 
not alter the fact that he is an entity of a specific kinda rational being 
that he cannot function successfully under coercion, and that rights
are a necessary condition of his particular mode of survival.
"The source of man's rights is not divine law or congressional law, but 
the law of identity. A is Aand Man is Man. Rights are conditions of exist
ence required by man's nature for his proper survival. If man is to live on 
earth, it is right for him to use his mind, it is right to act on his own free 
judgment, it is right to work for his values and to keep the product of his 
work. If life on earth is his purpose, he has a right to live as a rational being: 
nature forbids him the irrational." (Atlas Shrugged)
To violate man's rights means to compel him to act against his own 
judgment, or to expropriate his values. Basically, there is only one way to 
do it: by the use of physical force. There are two potential violators of 
man's rights: the criminals and the government. The great achievement 
of the United States was to draw a distinction between these twoby 
forbidding to the second the legalized version of the activities of the first.
The Declaration of Independence laid down the principle that "to 
secure these rights, governments are instituted among men." This pro
vided the only valid justification of a government and defined its only 
proper purpose: to protect man's rights by protecting him from physical 
violence.
Thus the government's function was changed from the role of ruler to 
the role of servant. The government as set to protect man from crim
inalsand the Constitution was written to protect man from the govern
ment. The Bill of Rights was not directed against private citizens, but 
against the governmentas an explicit declaration that individual rights 
supersede any public or social power.
The result was the pattern of a civilized society whichfor the brief 
span of some hundred and fifty yearsAmerica came close to achieving. 
A civilized society is one in which physical force is ban-ned from human 
relationshipsin which the government, acting as a policeman, may use 
force only in retaliation and only against those who initiate its use.
This was the essential meaning and intent of America's political phi
losophy, implicit in the principle of individual rights....
Ayn Rand 
April, 1963
"My philosophy, in essence, is the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own 
happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his 
noblest activity and reason as his only absolute." 
Ayn Rand

ARMAGEDDON
On July 1,1998, a meteor the size of Texas is expected to 
make a deep impact on the planet. Don't worry. You don't 
have to run for your lives just yet. This meteor can only 
be seen from select movie theaters. For the price of ad
mission, you also get to see a group of drilling special
ists attempt to land on the meteor and drop a nuclear 
device in its core. These roughneck oil drillers include 
the likes of Bruce Willis, Steve Buscemi, and Ben Affleck. 
You might ask "Where is Mr. Affleck's partner, Mr. 
Damon?" Do not fret. Mr. Damon is currently preoccu
pied. However, he has been suitably replaced by Liv Tyler 
as Affleck's love interest in the movie.

There isnt much to say here. To the designers and 
writers, this issue represents the culmination of their 
undergraduate career. The work will speak for itself.
To many readers out there, this might seem like the 
poetry issue. Let us assure you, its not. This is the 
senior issue. The fact that we had an overwhelming 
amount of good poetry was just an added benefit. 
These pieces represent some of the best work at this 
school. The layouts included a striking combination 
of old-style ornaments, metaphorical imagery, and 
structured pages.
6:10 pm, Friday, April 24th, 1998.
The weather is great outside. The sun is reddening faces and shoulders, 
children are playing because its still light out, and cool breezes are helping the kiteflyers on Flagstaff. Throughout this semester, writers and designers have been getting 
their work grilled by the eyes of the school  their pieces have either tasted suc
culent or wound up not far from charcoal. But now, just before summer, in the twilght 
of their undergraduate careers, these seniors have given you their best cuts. Enjoy.

KI LT H EARNI pause outside the coffeeshop, 
lean against damp brick, 
finish my cigarette.
I am locked out of my home 
again, no place to be except 
here on the shiny pavement, 
anticipating bustle and warmth, 
strands of cold hair 
blowing across my lips.
Three women stroll by, 
bundled in slick fur, 
arms linked. They murmur 
Russian, sail oblivious 
on the crowded sidewalk. 
Sweeping by me, 
coats swing, touch my thigh.
I am invisible, falling 
into sidewalk cracks, 
no place else to be.

---------------------------------------------------

8 my fathers Car
Because it is winter, rub out 
the frost on the rear window 
to see the styrofoam cup
spilling nickels and dimes.
Notice that the backseat 
has been ripped out
to make room for the one-eyed cat.
Take a look at the reflection in the tilted 
rearview mirror of a man with a brokendoorknob past, of a body bloated with memory.
You can see the leather biker's hat 
over my father's face,
and his barrel chest rise and fall y  T) '
like the metal ball that measures JUStin XilgOS
the force of a carnival hammer.
Look at his briefcase
it sits in the passenger seat, half-open;
the comer of an eviction notice.
The Bible on the dashboard, 
all the bookmarks In Revelations.
Put an ear to the roof
and hear my father murmur
about cancer, the lottery and how the demons
tap the hubcaps with their ball-point pens.
Dont bother scanning
for whiskey bottles, cigarettes
or any vice you can hold In your hand.
If you stand back from this car 
and size up the situation, 
you will be forced to admit
there is such a thing as bad luck.
This is my father's home.
Pick it up in your hand and gently shake 
watch the fake snow settle

On the Ramblas, I stop
at markets, wander
the counters while mothers,
butchers watch me
buy cheese, bread,
sometimes milk
if they have it.
But really 
I go to see the meat 
stacked in neat rows across 
the freezer shelves. Skinned cow 
heads stare through glass, their eyes 
swell with liquid clarity. I imagine 
pressing my fingertips into cold 
flesh until they squeak.
I push my open lips against 
the window, the cows feel 
my breath. I blow until my cheeks 
mimic their own stark gaze.

How does one tell these stories?
Beltane Night 
Fell cool and Smooth.
In preparation,
He handed me the single malt 
Warning me to sip.
Though whisky gives me goosebumps,
I let it slide over my lips 
Across my tongue
Wanning its way to my belly.
I let him slip
My gypsy blouse
Down Over my breasts.
I let him him paint me red. 
Aided and abetted
Into that dreamy state,
I danced into the drumbeat
Over hot coals,
Over lovers,
And washed my face 
In the morning dew
Sol could remain

BARAKA*
The empty courtyard of an ancient temple 
opens itself into dirt fields. 
Stones, fallen from its walls, lay 
like pieces of white gold in dust.
Hundreds of pale yellow candles burn, 
flicker at the edge of a barely blue sky.
Hundreds^f tin^ fires 
consuming the^r.

Slate
Amanda Spear
Banging, clanging wakes me this hot morning. 
Eyes fly wide, I see my room filled 
with white light, sheets sweatily crumpled 
around my legs, edges of posters. ;curling 
' off the wall, as if they too can^f^v 
stand a clammy touch.
Workmen are tearing the roof off ; ; 
my house, throwing slate down 
stories into the yard 
Piles accumulate to 
and oblique work talk., * - *
This roof placed with such 
eighty-five years ago rains 
black dust on windowsills, makes 
the cat sneeze, blackens my feet.
I go outside later to salvage 
pieces in the dark, cigarette 
dangling from my lips.
I pick through the dirty pile, 
dark smudge on my chin, 
crunching history underfoot.

---------------------------------------------------

Imiais in a Bedroom
Shadows crawl sluggishly across a canopied bed; 
Dust motes sigh their sad way through the tepid air. 
Whispers speak themselves in moldy corners 
Like memories, and they are fading away slowly
Cobwebs; spider-webs; not even the spiders can tell them apart. 
They clog the corners, people the dark crevices,
Caress the ceiling with their delicate, deadly, ancient fingers. 
Like the claws of a dead beast, still unquiet, they tremble.
In the corner there are letters; they rriolder silently.
Passions fade and old glories turn to dust underneath their wooden skin. 
Over a period of many years they gain weight as they decompose, 
and the grainy floorboards strain to hold their swollen remains
There is an old desk in the room. It is covered by a tarp.
Under the thick veneer of, years there still lives a certain dull radiance, L
like the light in the eyes of an old man, his eyes shiny with death, 
lyjiojcn^ws that he is withering ina place where he once inspired
And of course a shifferobe - the mainstay and centerpiece of vanished years. 
Heirloom; relic; firewood. It is the warden of the past 
which bars the doors with cracked, fluidless arms and un-tender haunches, 
and it is somehow fitting that it is always left empty.
A long time ago the room was locked. A long time later the lock became broken. by David Reinoehl
No maid remembers why now; no butier cares, or sees why the dust seems so thin.
Years pass, men lift their chins, women square their shoulders, children grow and forget 
But old rooms, their hollows like dust, only grow more empty.

---------------------------------------------------

Wreckognition
I. Twenty FeetII. Ten FeetII. Two FeetIV. Minus Two Inches
Recognition like a nagging cold 
Shivers down the brain.
Brief supposition of who 
This is supposed to be 
Spmeone you once knew.
That brown hair, 
those brown eyes.
Clarity of face
And disparity of recollection
Asks the question
"Why Do I know this person?"
Suddenly
The mental VCR turns on. 
Sophomore year. Economics. 
Laughs shared over bread 
and circuses.
Names never exchanged 
Between prisoners of lecture. 
You think it might be Dave.
"Hi, Dave," is still 
lodged between your teeth 
As you lose the names 
Of all the faces 
Floating by yearly.

" his eyes unseen but frowning, uncaring 
of her aching back and arms. "I toidya, , 
keep the sign up!" he grunts, snapping again. 
Sunlight smirks onto the driveway of the new 
 development proudly backdropping the scene. 
Her jaws clench, grimacing into sky blue.
Later he will dip her in chemicals,
To get one perfect print. It's a living.

ly form the image of her face, smiling, 
hiding the thoughts that aren't so rapturous. 
Isn't it strange how cameras can capture us?
