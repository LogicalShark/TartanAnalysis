President Clinton addressed the public at Robert Morris College last Wednesday. It 
was his only stop in Pittsburgh on his campaign tour.
Clinton attacked the issues students wanted to 
know about, said Amanda Wilks, a senior at Robert 
Morris College majoring in information systems. This 
was the overwhelming consensus  that President 
Clintons speech was to the point and very informative. 
Most students were very impressed by the way he 
addressed issues concerning them, such as college 
tuition assistance. President Clintons budget plan 
was exceptional. How hes changed [the budget] is 
phenomenal, said Derick Wagraft, a junior manage
ment major at Robert Morris College.
President Clintons speech was well-received by 
most of the attending students. There were approxi
mately-200 tickets available to Carnegie Mellon stu
dents, but since they were only made available the 
day before, there was difficulty getting the word of 
their availability out to students.

TOC offers job contacts for technical students
By JAYA SAXENA
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
The University Center Gym 
was occupied by more than 1000 
students, representatives of 120 
companies from around the coun
try, possible job offers, and lots of 
free goodies last Thursday as this 
years Technical Opportunities 
Conference (TOC) brought to
gether job recruiters and CMU 
students.
The TOC is an annual event 
sponsored by The Society of 
Women Engineers (SWE) and 
the Institute of Electrical and 
Electronics Engineers (IEEE). 
This year, the conference feaI ; tured the largest number of companies and the most students in 
attendance according to senior 
TOC Chairperson and mechani
cal engineering major Shannon 
Wowak. SWE and IEEE also 
worked together to organize a 
wake-up breakfast for company 
representatives and CMU fac
ulty members. Wowak said that 
the job fair was directed towards 
people with technical back
grounds and has proven to be a 
successful event in the past. 
David Lewis, a member of the 
AT&T Tech staff, said that about
30 percent of their employers 
are past CMU graduates. Peter 
Ozarowski, manager of College 
and University Relations for IBM 
said, [I am] very pleased [with
the TOC].... I have seen quite a 
few high quality students. 
Wowak also thought the confer
ence was very positive. Its been 
a good turnout... the companies 
are excited and the students are 
excited, she said.
Hilda Diamond, advisor of the 
TOC, said, The demand for CMU 
students reflects the Universitys 
commitment to the highest stan
dards of education, state-of-theart educational facilities, and re
flects the intellectual environ
ment that permeates our stu
dent body.
Most recruiters and company 
officials look for similar charac
teristics in prospective employ
ees. Bob Hay, campus manager
Annual BOC targets CMUs business students

Last Friday, CMUs Business 
Opportunities Conference 
(BOC), an annual event spon
sored by the Association for 
Industrial Management and 
Economic Studies (AIME) and 
the Graphic Communications 
Management Student Organi

firms from all over the nation
 a 100-percent improvement 
from the attendance of last

This year, the Committee is 
pleased to provide an extremely

New ID cards may be in 
the works for CMU students. 
According to John Papinchak 
of Enrollment Services, the 
program will only affect the 
ID cards themselves, at this 
point. We will be capturing 
ID images via a DataCard 
system in a computer. This 
will enable us to replace the 
current ID cards. So, we are 
only implementing a change 
in the ID card, he said.
The current cards are be
ing replaced for a number of 
reasons. Papinchak said, We 
are replacing the current ID 
cards in order to improve the 
durability of the cards, and to 
enhance the opportunities of 
the cards. One of the changes 
being implemented in the new 
cards includes the addition of 
an ABA industry-standard 
magnetic strip. Current cards 
use a magnetic strip that re
quires special reader ma
chines. Papinchak said this 
change will allow other card 
uses beside the current use 
for dining [block meals and 
DineXpress] and campus ex
press.
Currently, a timetable is be
ing worked on to implement 
the new ID card system late 
this semester, according to 
Papinchak.
There were various reac
tions from students about the 
new ID cards. While there
were few details available 
about the cards at press time, 
students commented on the 
current card system and what 
they hope the opportunities 
would be with the new card 
system.
Keith Michel, ajuniorCS ma
jor, said, I like the way the 
cards are set up now. If they 
are going to improve the dura
bility, I think that is a good 
idea because they tend to fall 
apart now.
Michael Im, a sophomore bi
ology major, said, I think that 
we should be able to use our 
new ID cards at Oakland res
taurants like the Pitt cards ... 
I think they should just con
solidate the DineXpress and 
Campus Express ... and make 
it more useful.
Wole Oyenuga, a sophomore 
mechanical engineering/in
dustrial management double 
major, looked forward to the 
possibility of being able to use 
IDs in Oakland. People at 
CMU could get out more in
stead of being trapped in this 
little community, he said.
Oyenuga also pointed out the 
difficutly in getting new IDs for 
every student. It would be hard 
to do for a whole school of people, 
but if they organized [it], I guess 
it wouldnt be a big thing.
It might be a hassle to 
have everybody go down and 
get new IDs. I can imagine 
long lines, said freshman 
physics major Michael 
Brauer.

President seeks support from students
By SHARMILA VENKATASUBBAN
Tartan Features Editor
With the polls indicating a significant 
lead in Pennsylvania, President Clinton 
didnt mask his confidence of re-election 
at Robert Morris College last Wednes
day. This is the first time that one 
administration has cut the budget defi
cit in one term since John Tyler in the 
1840s, he said. Unfortunately, John 
Tyler was not re-elected.
While his official program for the morn
ing was his proposal for an inflationproof government bond targeted to
wards the middle class, Clintons ad
dress to the 3,000 students and resi
dents of southwestern Pennsylvania cen
tered around his intentions to continue 
on the right path towards a strong 
economy during his next term.
Four years ago, just before the Presi
dential election, I came to Pittsburgh 
and said that I entered the campaign 
because... I didnt want my daughter to 
be part of the first generation of Ameri
cans to do worse than her parents, 
Clinton said. Well, today Im here to tell 
you that Im not worried about that 
anymore.
Clinton told the students that he 
planned to secure their futures by his 
past and continued efforts to broaden 
international markets and U.S. exports, 
provide portable health insurance, al
low for the minimum wage to keep ris
ing, and increase job opportunities 
through research and technological ad
vances.
We have brought unemployment 
down by one-third  lower than it has 
been in seven years, Clinton said. Ten
and a half million new jobs have been 
created, with just under 100,000 in Penn
sylvania alone.
Clinton also mapped out governmentfunded research ventures that would 
produce a supercomputer able to do 
more calculations in one second than a 
hand calculator can do in 30,000 years, 
and genetic advances that would detect 
physical disabilities in unborn babies.
[These opportunities] will ... create 
huge numbers of new, fascinating highwage jobs that have not even been in
vented for people like the young people 
who go to Robert Morris, he said.
The President was accompanied by 
Secretary of the Treasury Robert E. 
Rubin, who applauded Clinton for in
novating uplifting fiscal policies and 
increasing the national savings rate in

Fighting erupts again in the West Bank and Gaza
JERUSALEM, Sept. 26 (Reuter) 
Israeli troops killed 39 Palestinians 
and Palestinian police shot to death 11 
Israelis on Thursday in gun battles 
and stone-throwing clashes which 
threatened to undermine five years of 
U.S.-driven Middle East peacemaking.
Efforts were underway to arrange a 
meeting between Israels hard-line 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 
and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat 
to end the violence.
The unprecedented clashes and gunfights between Arafats paramilitary 
police and Israeli soliders still occupy
ing parts of the West Bank and Gaza 
Strip have claimed 44 Palestinian lives 
in two days.
More than 740 Arabs and 50 Jews 
were injured on Thursday in the fight
ing, which resembled Beirut militia 
battles as Palestinian police let off 
bursts of automatic rifle fire at crouch; ing Israeli soldiers.
Israel declared a state of emergency, 
J deploying extra troops and sending in 
1 tanks and helicopters to quell the vior lence. It was the first time Israel had 
' used tanks in the West Bank since it 
* captured the territory in 1967, Israeli 
J Radio said.
Israeli helicopters fired at gunmen in 
u apartment blocks in Ramallah, north 
J of Jerusalem, and armored personnel 
carriers tried to rescue Israelis trapped 
inside the Jewish shrine of Josephs 
TombintheWestBanktownofNablus, 
~ where six of the 11 Israelis were killed. 
 Netanyahu, whose decision to open 
1 an archeological tunnel in Israeli-an
nexed Arab East Jerusalem triggered 
the violence, cut short a European tour
* and asked for a meeting with Arafat.
But Palestinian officials said they 
doubted that a meeting would take 
' place Thursday, adding that both sides 
J were studying a proposal by Egyptian 
President Hosni Mubarak for a threeway summit in Cairo.
Visiting wounded Palestinians in 
Gaza, Arafat called the clashes a real 
massacre against the Palestinian 
people.
The United States, which has to 
balance being Israels staunchest ally 
with its role as peace broker, called for 
a halt to the fighting and a resumption 
of peace talks.
I asked both sides to end this vio
lence, to get back to the business of the 
peace ... to resolve their differences 
through negotiations, President 
Clinton said in Washington.
Palestinian officials said Arafat, who 
returned to Gaza in July 1994 to lead 
the Palestinian self-rule authority, 
wanted Netanyahu to commit himself 
to honoring peace deals signed with 
the previous Labor government and
not just discuss an end to the violence.
An Arab League meeting in Cairo 
hailed what it called the intifada of 
the Palestinian people and said the 
tunnel was part of a plot to destroy a 
Muslim shrine.
Arafat ordered his 30,000-strong po
lice to shoot only if fired on. Palestin
ian policemen tried to hold back stonethrowers after the worst of the fight
ing had subsided, witnesses said.
Fighting was strongest around Jew
ish settlements in Gaza, at the en
trance to Palestinian-ruled Ramallah, 
and at Josephs Tomb in Nablus where 
sources said about 40 soldiers and 
settlers were besieged by stonethrowers. They were later evacuated.
Israel denied that its opening of the 
tunnel adjacent to the al-Aqsa and 
Dome of the Rock mosque complex, 
Islams third holiest shrine after 
Mecca and Medina, was an assault on 
Muslim sites.
But the move unleashed long pentup Palestinian frustration with the 
self-rule agreement that Netanyahu 
has delayed. In private, Western dip
lomats called the tunnel-opening the 
biggest political miscalculation of 
Netanyahus 100-day-long term.
The Palestinian Authority urged 
Arab states to isolate and punish Is
rael. The Palestinian delegate to the 
Arab League, Mohamed Sobeih, made 
the appeal at the one-day Arab League 
meeting in Cairo.
Palestinian land has been turned 
into fields of war, on which many mar
tyrs have fallen, Sobeih said.
The French Foreign Ministry ac
cused Israel of triggering the riots and 
said they were a worrying throwback 
to the 1987-93 intifada. Then, youths 
confronted Israeli troops with stones.
This week the youths urged their 
police  armed under terms of a 1993 
peace deal with Israel  to protect 
them. In Gaza, when one Palestinian 
policemen fell wounded, a young boy 
picked up his rifle and shot at Israelis.
Stop throwing stones, this will not 
help now, a Palestinian officer 
shouted. His words were drowned out 
by the crackle of automatic rifle fire 
from members of Arafats Preventive 
Security force and the Coast Guard.
Protests in Jerusalem, which is cut 
off from the West Bank by an Israeli 
closure, were muted. Palestinians ac
cuse Israel of trying to Judaize Arab 
East Jerusalem, which they consider to 
be illegally occupied by the Jewish state.
Israeli Defense Minister Yizhak 
Mordechai questioned the decision to 
open the tunnel. I dont know whether 
to say with finality that... all consider
ations were taken into account, he 
told reporters.
Klaas killer gets death sentence
SAN JOSE, Calif., Sept. 26 (Reuter) 
Richard Davis was sentenced to death 
Thursday for the 1993 kidnapping and 
murder of 12-year-old Polly Klaas after 
he caused an uproar in court by accusing 
the victims father of molesting his own 
daughter.
It is the order of this court that you 
shall suffer the death penalty, Santa 
Clara County Superior Court Judge 
Thomas Hastings told Davis, who sat 
impassively with his lawyers.
Davis, a 42-year-old parolee with sev
eral previous convictions, showed little 
remorse as he was sentenced to death, 
almost three years after the October 1, 
1993, kidnapping that stunned the na
tion.
Klaas was abducted at knifepoint from 
a slumber party with friends at her 
home in Petaluma in northern Califor
nia while her mother slept down the 
hall. Davis led police to her body, buried 
in a shallow grave, two months later.
Interviewed by police in December 
1993, Davis confessed to strangling Klaas 
with a piece of yellow cloth. He ada
mantly denied trying to molest her sexu
ally, but accused Klaass father of mo
lesting his own daughter.
The main reason I know I did not 
attempt any lewd act that night was 
because of a statement the young girl 
made to me when walking her up the 
embankment: Just dont do me like my 
dad,  Davis said.
Klaass father, Marc, who has repeat
edly called for the death penalty for 
Davis, shouted, Bum in hell, Davis! as 
Klaass family members sobbed and oth
ers in the audience gasped.
Davis said that for what its worth he 
offered his sincere apology to Klaass 
mother, Eve Nichol, and to certain mem
bers of the Klaas family.
But the gray-haired Davis showedlittle 
remorse as he made a number of com
plaints about the way his case was 
handled, saying police should have pro
vided him with a lawyer when they first 
interviewed him after his arrest.
Addressing Davis, Marc Klaas said: 
When you get where youre going, say 
hello to Hitler, say hello to (serial killer 
Jeffrey) Dahmer and say hello to (serial 
killer Ted) Bundy, and good riddance, 
and the sooner you get there, the better 
off we all are.
Saying that handing down a death 
sentence was always traumatic for a 
judge, he told Davis: Youve made it 
very easy today by your conduct.
Davis caused an uproar after his con
viction in June when he made an ob
scene gesture toward television cam
eras and the Klaas family in court.
Davis was also convicted of kid
napping, robbery, burglary, assault 
with a deadly weapon and false im
prisonment. Hastings ordered him 
taken to San Quentin state prison 
near San Francisco where he will be
held until he is executed.
Under California law, the death pen
alty will automatically be appealed. The 
appeals process usually takes years.
Thousands of northern California resi
dents joined in a huge search for Klaas 
after her disappearance. Her murder 
spurred Californias drive to pass a three 
strikes and youre out law mandating 
tough sentences for repeat offenders.
Yeltsins health worries Russia
MOSCOW, Sept. 26 (Reuter)  Secu
rity chief Alexander Lebed, painting a 
picture of deep instability in Russia as 
President Boris Yeltsin prepares for 
heart surgery, said Thursday that Rus
sia was on the brink of chaos and the 
army could soon mutiny.
Lebed warned that discontent was 
growing among soldiers over non-payment of wages. If some serious mea
sures are not taken, we will have a very 
hot October, he said in an interview 
with Russian Public Television.
The ominous statement, with its ech
oes of the revolutionary Red October of 
1917, was in line with remarks at an 
earlier news conference in which he said: 
We are at a dangerous limit, a very 
dangerous limit. It is not a time to fight. 
We must get out of the abyss.
Doctors said Wednesday Yeltsin was 
fit enough to have heart surgery, but 
they delayed his planned bypass opera
tion for at least six weeks to improve the 
chances of success.
Chief Kremlin physician Sergei 
Mironov told NTV commercial televi
sion that Yeltsin was working two to 
three hours a day.
The surgery is expected to last up to 
an hour and 45 minutes. The post
operation recovery period might be 
about two months, but Mironov said 
Yeltsin could start work sooner. Asked 
when he could take back the/^nuclear 
button which controls Russias stra
tegic weapons, he said: I think after
24 hours, after he has completely come 
around from the anesthetic.
Yeltsin will hand over power to 
Chernomyrdin, his constitutional standin, before the operation. The premier 
has already assumed some of Yeltsins 
responsibilities for coordinating the work 
of the Defense and Security Ministries.
The will of the state has gone.... Many 
people have adopted a wait-and-see po
sition, said Lebed, a blunt-spoken 46- 
year-old retired paratroop general.
Chernomyrdin made clear he would 
not tolerate any lobbying by his Cabinet 
ministers to protect their own interest 
groups as they draw up the 1997 budget, 
which needs parliaments approval.
If members of the government start 
playing any kind of game there, in the 
State Duma (lower house of parliament), 
I warn them that whoever they are, 
whatever their rank, they will not work 
here, the Interfax news agency quoted 
him as saying.
Movie trilogy to be released soon
BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. Sept. 26, 
(ENTERTAINMENT WIRE)  20th 
Century Fox Thursday announced the 
theatrical release dates for the Star 
Wars trilogy special edition.
Star Wars will premiere on January 
31, 1997, followed by The Empire 
Strikes Back on February 21 and Re
turn of the Jedi on March 7.
Commented Peter Chernin, chair
man and CEO of Fox Filmed Enter
tainment: Beginning January 31
with the release of the Star Wars 
trilogy, a new generation of children 
and their parents will be able to 
experience one of the great cinematic 
events of all time as it was meant  
on the big screen.
Audiences will be able to experi
ence the epic saga with digitally re
mastered soundtracks, restored 
prints, enhanced visual effects and 
new added footage. Using state-ofthe-art computer technology, George 
Lucas has been able to update each 
film of the trilogy to bring it closer to 
his original vision.
Commented Lucas: Im tremendously 
excited about bringing the trilogy back 
to motion picture theaters. Those who 
have seen it before can now share with 
a new generation the unique experi
ence of seeing the Star Wars trilogy on 
the big screen.
Commented Tom Sherak, senior ex
ecutive vice president, 20th Century 
Fox: In distributing the trilogy, we 
are emphasizing those theaters that 
are equipped with digital and THX 
sound. Experiencing these movies on 
the big screen is a celebration of the 
fun of moviegoing. If there was ever a 
reason as to why movie theaters were 
built, that reason is Star Wars, The 
Empire Strikes Back, and Return of 
.the Jedi. ,,,

50 YEARS AGO, Nov. 51946: 
Colgate Prentice, the president 
of the Student Federalists came 
to Carnegie Tech to speak. The 
Student Federalists Inc., a group 
organized by Prentice the year 
before, was a non-partisan stu
dent movement, entirely run and 
organized by students. It had 
3500 students campaigning for 
federal world government.
Prentice, a 22-year-old war vet
eran and then a junior at 
Swarthmore College was taking 
a term off in order to make the 
lecture tour. In his speech, World 
Government, a Challenge, 
Prentice presented world govern
ment as a practical necessity. 
Prentice argued that the United 
Nations could not prevent an
other war.
25 YEARS AGO, Oct. 14,1971: 
A child care center opened to care 
for the children of CMU faculty, 
staff, alumni, and students. Lo
cated in the recreation room of 
Morewood Gardens, the center 
remained open between the hours 
of 8 am and 5:30 pm.
The recreation room was cho
sen for the center, which accepted
children between the ages of three 
and six, because it was the only 
place on campus that did not re
quire extensive renovation.
The center opened a little over 
a month into the school year with 
an initial group of 15 children 
enrolled. Enough parents had 
submitted additional applications 
for a second group to be created.
Several students volunteered 
to help work with children, while 
others planned to used them as 
part of independent study 
projects, pending approval by the 
parents and two committees.
10 YEARS AGO, Oct. 7,1986: 
Carnegie Mellons first Business 
Opportunities Conference (BOC) 
was planned. After seeing five 
successful Technical Opportuni
ties Conferences come and go, IM 
majors decided to take charge of 
their careers.
The BOC organizers were un
able to obtain funding from Stu
dent Senate, but achieved mon
etary support from the AIME and 
the deans of GSIA. The BOC was 
brought about to familiarize stu
dents with corporate representa
tives, in the hope of mimicking
the TOCs success. In the TOCs 
first five years, three students 
obtained job offers at the confer
ence itself, while several compa
nies presented offers later.
Although the BOC organizers 
had hoped to convince 40 corpo
rations to attend, they were only 
able to confirm seven concrete 
reservations a week before the 
event.
FIVE YEARS AGO, Sept. 30, 
1991: In the U.S. News and World 
Report rankings of selected 
schools, Carnegie Mellon dropped 
to 24th, two places down from the 
year before.
The rankings were established 
by rating each schodl in five cat
egories: academic reputation, stu
dent selectivity, faculty resources, 
financial resources, and student 
satisfaction. Each category was 
then given a weight. Financial 
resources was given a 20 percent 
weight, student satisfaction 5 
percent, and 25 percent for each 
of the other three categories.
Despite total spending per stu
dent rising from $33,607 to 
$40,884 in the past year, CMU 
paled in statistical comparision
to the other top 25 schools. Car
negie Mellon appeared at or near 
the bottom in student satisfac
tion, the freshman retention rate, 
and the graduation rate.
ONE YEAR AGO, Oct. 2,1995: 
The presses rolled at the Student 
Union again. After fighting orga
nizational problems, a budget 
battle with Student Senate, and 
a dispute with its former printer, 
CMUs alternative newspaper 
reappeared.
The Union was dropped by its 
printer, Typecraft Press, because 
the companys owner considered 
some material in the paper of
fensive. Senate cut the Unions 
budget from $10,000 to $4,600, 
and threatened to have that bud
get frozen unless they group cre
ated some sort of organizational 
hierarchy. This move came after 
the Union did not have a repre
sentative present at its budget 
hearing in front of Student Sen
ate. The paper was set to print 
only six issues because of the 
budget cuts.

BOC offers career contacts for students
B7P0 sdrN CwSi ,
more than five years now, and 
according to Steen, it finds the 
BOC an excellent opportunity 
to meet potential employees.
Even large companies like 
IBM look to the CS and fi
nance departments of CMU 
for qualified students. This 
year, IBM was not only inter
ested in computer scientists, 
but was also looking to recruit 
consultants. Other smaller 
companies, such as the 
Susquehanna Investment 
Group, accepted thirty to forty 
resumes from students dur
ing the conference, expecting 
to hear from a high percent
age of the students who were 
interested in the group. 
Prograph representatives, an
other local software manufacturing company, said that 60 
percent of its employees are 
CMU CS and IM graduates.
Students who attended the 
conference to discuss topics deal
ing with permanent employment 
and internships with the many 
companies believed the BOC to 
be as successful as the compa
nies found it to be. According to 
Bryan Rhee, a junior IM major, 
the job fair provided a great op
portunity for possible careers in 
finance.
He mentioned, however, that 
students interested in market
ing may have been disap
pointed with the relative lack 
of marketing firms compared 
to computer science and elec
trical and computer engineer
ing firms.
Another student, who wished
to remain anonymous, denied 
this and said, that he felt the 
BOC was well-balanced. 
Though student opinion varied 
slightly, most suggested that 
future BOCs should have more 
diversity.
According to many of the com
panies as well as students, the 
organization of this years BOC 
was considered to be top 
notch, as it was described by 
the representative of the May 
Department Store Company. In 
addition, the BOC was far-better planned than those of pre
vious years, with staff mem
bers using walkie-talkies and 
other staff members patrolling 
the area to check if the water 
jugs at each companys desk 
were full.
Every years BOC is differ
ent, but this years was about 
twice the size of last years and 
had about two or three times as 
many students, said Nick 
Frollini, senior IM major and 
public relations coordinator of 
the BOC Committee. The com
mittee estimated the student 
attendance to be about 700 for 
the day.
In comparison to the Tech
nology Opportunities Confer
ence (TOC), the representative 
of Proctor and Gamble, Scott 
Isenbart, described the BOC as 
better from a logistical stand
point.
As for future BOCs, Frollini 
said that he will give recom
mendations to the next com
mittee. Right now, he said, 
this years committee needs a 
well-deserved break.

Students pack hall to hear President
Andrew McDermott/Tartan Managing Editor 
President Clinton included tuition hikes and the budget deficit in his speech last Wednesday.
Clinton tackles important issues
PfWO.7O0 sdrN CwSi ,
his term.
From his first day in the oval 
office ... he tackled the national 
deficit, Rubin said. He went on 
to say that the deficit has gone 
down 60 percent since Clinton 
took office.
Clintons newest effort to pro
tect Americans investments is 
treasury bonds intended to buffer 
the middle class against infla
tion increases. By January, the 
Treasury will begin issuing tenyear bonds in denominations as 
low as $1000. With interest at
tached to the consumer price in
dex, which increases alongside
inflation, the real value of in
vestments remains stable de
spite inflation fluctuations.
By the following January, an 
interest-free savings bond will be 
available from $50 and higher.
Rubin said the bonds were just 
the next in a long line of actions 
taken by Clinton to lower inflation 
rates, having brought it down by 
two percent in the last four years.
To encourage working people to 
further their education, the gov
ernment will also allow individu
als to earn tax-free interest on edu
cation savings bonds. The exemp
tion will only apply if the bonds are 
put towards tuition costs.
Clintons hopes to make long
term education more accessible 
to working people through the 
proposed economic changes. We 
need to reach new frontiers of ... 
quality of life, Clinton said.
Both the President and 
Rubin were introduced by 
Pennsylvania Congressman 
Frank Mascara, who said plans 
were in the works to bring the 
First Lady and the Vice Presi
dent to Pittsburgh.
I never thought Id have the 
opportunity to host the Presi
dent of the United States, he 
said. Only in America is it pos
sible.
E.cyLO.0 sdrN CwSi ,
The issue that most students 
were concerned with was col
lege tuition breaks. Clinton pro
posed three main options which 
he referred to as building a 
bridge to the twenty-first cen
tury. The first option was 
aimed more toward families. In 
this plan, parents could draw 
upon their income to pay tu
ition. Clinton also proposed that 
for the first two years of a 
students college career, parents 
could deduct $1,500 from their 
taxes. The last option was also 
mainly for parents, as 
he said that tuition up 
to $10,000 should be 
tax-deductible. These 
are all allotted for in 
Clintons balanced 
budget plan, which he 
is pushing very hard 
during his campaign.
We shouldnt cut our 
investments in education, said 
Clinton.
The only problems that stu
dents, such as Chuck 
Kuzniewski, a sophomore com
munications major at Robert 
Morris college, saw with these 
options were that President 
Clinton did not give a definite 
answer as to where the money 
would come from to fund these 
programs.
Some students commented 
on the fact that for most college 
tuitions today, $1,500 is just 
not enough, according to 
Booker Stallworth, a senior po
litical science major at Univer
sity of Pittsburgh. Brian 
Kurfman, a senior biology and 
sciology major at CMU, said 
that he went to see Clinton with 
an unsure mind of who [he]
was going to vote for and he 
was very impressed with the 
way he spoke. Kurfman 
thought that Clinton focused 
a lot toward the age level that 
was there and he also thought 
that the tax cuts and 
deductables were extremly well 
covered and thorough. 
Another aspect of Clintons 
speech that students seemed 
happy with was his proposal to 
raise the skill level of our gen
eral public, which means mak
ing college educations more ac
cessible to everyone who would
even if they agreed not to take 
their signs into the hall, they 
were not allowed in to hear 
President Clinton speak.
Their free speech wasnt 
good enough for the Presi
dent, said Marianne Gra
ham, a sophomore law major 
at Pitt. One student who was 
in the hall and did listen to 
Clintons speech also ex
pressed the same overall dis
taste for Clinton. Kuzniewski 
thought Clintons informa
tion and facts were in poor 
taste and that he was very
"Clinton attacked the issues students 
wanted to know about, 
 Amanda Wilks, Robert 
Morris senior
like to go to college. The only 
problem with this plan seemed 
to be the lack of funding. Mark 
Xenakis, University of Pitt stu
dent, said he was happy about 
Clintons plan to let everyone go 
to college.
However, there was a select 
group of people who were very 
unhappy with Clinton. The 
College Republicans branch at 
the University of Pittsburgh 
were represented by about 
twenty people last Wednes
day. Chris Duarte, a junior 
theater major at Pitt, said that 
the Secret Service told them 
that [ourl first amendment 
rights had been suspended for 
today when they tried to pro
test outside the hall where 
President Clinton was speak
ing. Also they were told that
difficult on the Reagan ad
ministration.
Sometimes the Presidential 
candidates look over the heads 
of college students, said Jeff 
Strittmater, an English major 
at Robert Morris. According to 
Heather Molingero, a junior 
accountanting major at Robert 
Morris College, Clintons 
speech was very informative, 
but she wished he would have 
talked about interest rates and 
how to keep them low. Wilks 
also thought he should have 
talked more about student is
sues such as [the problem of] 
increasing drug use and par
tial abortion. Another concern 
was where [Clintons] going to 
go in the next few years [in 
regards to social issues], said 
Kurfman.
Grime and Incident Report
9/20 INCIDENT, 9:52 pm. A 
caller, who would not be identi
fied, phoned campus police to com
plain about a 15 Steve Urkle doll 
hanging by a rope from a frater
nity balcony. A second caller made 
a similar complaint and a third 
unidentified caller stated that it' 
would be necessary to get the 
boys together and come down here 
to take care of business, if the 
doll was not removed.
An officer responded by travel
ing to the fraternity and speak
ing to its president. The officer 
advised the president that phone 
calls indicated that the callers 
found the hung doll to be racially 
offensive, and requested its im
mediate removal. The fraternity 
brother told the officer that the 
previous week an Alf doll had 
been hung off the balcony.
9/21 TRESPASS, 3:27 am. An 
RA complained to campus police 
that there were people on the 
roof of Morewood Gardens E 
Tower. Three officers responded 
and found the RA on the seventh 
floor with four individuals who 
had been on the roof.
Access was obtained through
an unsecure door that leads to 
the elevator mechanical room. A 
quick check did not produce any 
more actors. The door was se
cured and the actors were given 
internal discipline citations.
9/21 MEDICAL ESCORT,
5:27 am. An officer went to a 
fraternity house on a medical call 
for a student with a cut scalp. 
Upon arrival, the officer noticed 
that EMS was treating a CMU 
student. The victim stated that a 
four inch laceration to the head 
was caused by running into a tree 
while playing football.
The bleeding was stopped by 
EMS and the student was trans
ported to Presbyterian Hospital 
by the officer.
9/22 HINDERING APPRE
HENSION, 4:23 am. Officers 
were patrolling the fraternity 
area in uniform. The officers had 
determined to arrest a student 
for repeated disorderly and 
threatening conduct towards 
members of another fraternity. 
The student had previously been 
talking to members of another 
fraternity house.
As the officers approached, 
members of the house began to 
shout five-o, five-o, look out, 
the cops are coming, and other 
warnings in an attempt to alert 
the student of the officers in
tentions. Officers implored the 
fraternity brothers to stop, but 
were ignored.
The behavior constitutes the 
crime of hindering apprehen
sion or prosecution, and is 
classed as a grade three felony 
under PA law. The officers is
sued the house a citation through 
student life, since the behavior 
was not only illegal, but also pos
sibly jeopardized the safety of 
the police officers.
9/22 THEFT, 4:37 am. An of
ficer and a detective were pa
trolling the quad in uniform 
upon seeing a person walking 
away from the University Cen
ter loading dock with two or
ange milk crates. They stopped 
the actor in the fraternity drive
way and saw that the milk crates 
were labeled $300 fine for ille
gal possession.
The detective issued the stu
dent a citation for the theft of
the milk crates and the officer 
returned the crates to the load
ing dock which held dozens of 
other milk crates.
9/23 UNAUTHORIZED USE,
10:50 am. A victim reported to an 
officer that around 5 am someone 
tried to enter the victims com
puter. The victim produced a 
printout that showed a CMU stu
dent had logged into the PC, but 
no materials were deleted from 
the system.
9/24 THEFT, 9:47 pm. A stu
dent told an officer that unknown 
persons had removed the factory 
wheels on a bike that was owned 
by the complaintant. The bike 
was locked next to Scaife Hall 
and is valued at $300. The wheels 
had been removed and replaced 
with wheels of a much cheaper 
brand.
9/25 DOG AT LARGE PRO
HIBITED, 12:39 am. While on 
routine uniformed bike patrol, an 
officer observed a black poodle 
running loose on the cut near 
Warner Hall. Noticing that this 
was not the first time the dog was
caught without a leash, the of
ficer stopped to identify and ad
dress the dogs owner.
The owner, a CMU professor, 
stated that the officer had never 
made any complaints about the 
dog and became very defensive. 
The professor was told that the 
dog was in violation of city ordi
nance 633.08, dogs at large pro
hibited. The officer told the pro
fessor that a report would be filed 
and sent to the professors de
partment head, and that a cita
tion would be issued by mail.
9/26 UNAUTHORIZED SO
LICITATION, 12:34 pm. While 
on bike patrol by Warner Hall, an 
officer observed a male wearing 
a baseball cap who was stopping 
women and showing them books 
that were in his backpack. The 
officer stopped the male and iden
tified him.
The man told the officer that he 
was a monk for the Institute for 
Guaudiya Vaisnausim of 
Moundsville West Virginia. The 
officer informed the monk that 
CMU is private property and ad
vised him that if he wanted to sell 
or solicit on campus, he should
contact the Dean of Student Af- " 
fairs. He was also warned that if 
stopped again at CMU without 
proper authorization, he would 
be arrested.
9/26 THEFT, 1:37 pm. A vic
tim made a statement to an 
officer claiming the theft of a 
bike, sometime between 10 am 
and 1 pm. The bike was valued 
at $450.
 Chief of Campus Police, James 
LaPaglia, reviews all reports prior 
to release.
 Only three people on The Tar
tan staff see the reports: the Edi
tor-in-Chief', the News Editor, 
and the staffwriter typing the 
report.
 All personal names of com
plainants, victims, suspects, and 
fraternity names are omitted from 
the printed report. Ethnic descrip
tions and other personal details 
are given only in the context of 
complete descriptions.
 Not every incident that occurs 
on campus appears in the report.

FORUM
Carnegie Mellon University30 September 1996

CdrMhRi gii3ieR Irldt
If you feel sick when you wake 
up on Saturday morning, youre 
going to be out of luck. You can 
stand outside the door all you 
want  dressed in sweatpants 
and holding a handful of tissues 
 but Health Services still wont 
be open until Monday morning, 
and that will seem very far away.
Health Services is open Mon
day through Friday, from 8 am to 
7 pm. During these hours, a phy
sician, nurse practitioners and 
registered nurses are on-hand for 
student medical care. From pro
viding first-aid for minor cuts and 
burns to doing tests for different 
illnesses, Health Services is es
sential for the well-being of CMU 
students.
But Carnegie Mellon is a 24- 
hour University, and its students 
heed 24-hour health care.
Students can always get to the 
hospital  between EMS and 
Campus Police, emergency situa
tions are well-handled and the 
student is taken to the hospital 
for a serious problem. But most 
health concerns arent important 
enough to go to the hospital. 
Rather than go to the hospital 
and pay a significant amount of 
money, most students have to wait 
out the weekend and go to Health 
Services on Monday. By the time 
Health Services is open, the stu
dent may have been sick for up to 
*72 hours.
If Health Services had weekend 
hours, students would not have to 
wait the whole weekend for proper 
care. The sooner an illness is di
agnosed, the sooner treatment can 
begin and the sooner the student 
can get better.
Also, seeing a health-care pro
fessional as soon as possible does 
wonders for a students peace of
mind. A student may think he or 
she has the flu, but hearing it 
from a professional nurse and im
mediately receiving the proper 
care is a lot more reassuring.
By instituting weekend hours, 
students could get the care that 
Health Services offers within at 
most 12hours oftheonsetofsymptoms.
Health Services could look to 
expect the same amount of traffic 
over the weekend as it does dur
ing the week, once students know 
that the office is open. After all, 
students do not get any less sick 
because it is the weekend.
In fact, Health Services may 
actually get more traffic on the 
weekend because the students at 
CMU are always on the move, 
and often dont have time to get to 
Health Services during the week. 
The weekend is a good time for 
students to have a chance to get 
over to the health office for al
lergy shots, throat cultures, and 
other minor but important health 
matters.
The problem is that Health Ser
vices does not have the means to 
expand their hours to cover the 
weekendthey have neither the 
personnel nor money. The admin
istration should be committed to 
giving the students the best care 
possible, and should therefore 
make the required resources 
available to Health Services to 
establish weekend hours.
As with many University ser
vices, students need quality 
health care options seven days a 
week. In order to best serve the 
students with peace of mind 
and strength of health  Health 
Services must take responsibility 
for caring for them throughout 
the week and weekends alike.

Last weeks Technical and Busi
ness Opportunities Conferences 
were remarkable career fairs that 
offered many students the chance 
to land the job of their dreams. The 
organizers of both events did a fine 
job leveraging Carnegie Mellons 
reputation as a top tier scientific 
and analytic institution, and at
tracted a diverse group of corpora
tions which represented many dif
ferent industrial sectors. CMUs 
greater visibility in the market
place, coupled with this years 
strong recruiting season were criti
cal factors to the high levels of 
attendance. In addition, the Uni
versity Center proved itself to be a 
prime facility to host these large 
fairs.
 The TOCs success could be mea
sured in numbers: over 120 compa
nies were in attendance and over 
800 student brochures were given 
away within three hours. With the 
gym packed elbow-to-elbow, the 
companies expectations for stu
dents with engineering or comput
ing backgrounds were equally met 
by eager students. Science and 
business majors also tried their 
luck, and found nearly a quarter of 
these companies interested them 
in as well.
While many humanities and fine 
arts majors were disappointed with 
the lack of opportunities for them, 
their criticism should not be di
rected towards the organizers of 
the TOC. Rather, it should be a 
catalyst for their departments to
take the initiative to organize ca
reer fairs which further their in
terests.
After a dismal showing last year, 
the BOCs resurgence is nothing 
short of amazing. Despite last 
years conference that was plagued 
with a lack of strong leadership 
and organization, this years BOC 
committee pulled off a finely or
chestrated strategy that marketed 
the business schools high national 
rankings. Many companies came 
away impressed with the organiz
ers and students whom attended, 
further solidifying the Universitys 
reputation for producing fine pro
fessionals.
The Career Center deserves 
credit for contributing to the suc
cess of both fairs. Through infor
mative and in-depth workshops 
and materials on how to best take 
advantage of these conferences, the 
Career Center provided many un
derclassmen with invaluable ad
vice. The frequently-updated elec
tronic bulletin boards with the lo
cations of information sessions and 
other notes helped to clarify the 
changing schedules of the compa
nies in attendance. The mere pres
ence of the Career Center at both 
events lent to the impression that 
there was a coordinated effort to 
serve the students.
Overall, the organizers of both 
fairs deserve a congratulations and 
pat on the back for a job well done. 
Good luck to all students for the 
job-hunting season.

Columnist cultivates cynical outlook
Tom Harper
Every so often I whine and gripe 
about not having the most stellar so
cial life. Sometimes, I dont see why I 
should. I was not the most sociable 
person to begin with during my tenure 
in the public school system. There, the 
intelligent kids are often pretty low on 
the social totem pole.
Getting picked last for most play
ground team activities does not help 
your self-esteem, either.
I was always toldthat things would 
get better when I reached anew school. 
Yeah, sure, it sucks now, but wait 
until you get to junior high, I was told 
in elementary school. Oh, boy, were 
they wrong. Junior high was worse. 
But at least there wasnt any play
ground to lower my self-esteem even 
further.
There was the equivalent of the ste
reotypical Gifted Club, but I was an 
outsider even there. I always won
dered why such things were called 
Gifted Clubs.
My mind was no gift, thats for sure. 
I had to earn it. Maybe its called that 
so as not to discourage others who 
dont have that gift. Though from 
what Ive seen, if they didnt have the
gift, they didnt want it. I wonder what 
theyd do with such a gift if they were 
offered it.
My guess Would be they would throw 
it away because it would be such a det
riment to their social life.
Maybe such clubs are created to give 
gifted kids a niche of sorts.
From what I saw, many people in the 
club were as different as night and day, 
and they polarized into different fac
tions.
I see that at CMU all the time. Im sure 
I dont need to run down each and every 
division  most people with my degree 
of cynicism have created their own divi
sions.
Then I have to wonder why Im not in 
any of those divisions I created, or if I 
even want to be.
Most of my friends here, maybe even 
all of them, I really cant place in any 
division.
I have to wonder if I only see these 
divisions as a result of my own way of 
thinking when I get cynical.
Maybe I should shelve the cynicism 
and only take it out when I watch the 
evening news.
Now thats something everyone could 
use a little cynicism when dealing with.
I always lapse when I have an oppor
tunity to break out of the mold public 
school social structures have put me 
into. It takes all the courage I can sum
mon to try to approach a woman here, 
and, of course, everyone has their own 
opinion about the male/female situation
we have here at CMU.
In classes I still feel like an outsider 
because I dont really know most of 
the people in them with me. I am 
trying, though.
Maybe a good idea would be to start 
up a club for introverts like me. I 
thought about that once about a year 
ago, but I was sure no one would come 
because theyre busy being intro verts. 
And lord knows, I have enough work 
to do as it is.
Lately Ive managed to get on some 
chat lines on the Internet, and from 
what I see and read on there, many 
people are in the same boat that I am. 
I wonder if thats only natural. Most 
colleges have Internet access, and 
thats where intelligent people my 
age are.
I have talked to many of these 
people. Heck, Ive received e-mail from 
as far away as Oregon just about my 
columns here.
Now thats neat.
Maybe I should look just a bit harder 
to improve my social standing. Maybe 
I should join a club or two. In any case, 
I had better finish my work.
Maybe that could be an assignment 
of sortsfind out who my classmates 
are and work with them; Were not 
self-conscious when it comes to work, 
so why couldnt that work?
Tom Harper, senior technical writ
ing major, is just glad the weekend is 
here.

Ex-smoker calls for facilities to face frigid weather
Editor's Notebook
I quit smoking cigarettes two weeks 
before I arrived on campus, cold turkey 
from over a pack a day. Its been very 
difficult distracting myself from the com
fort of a cigarette on my way to class. And 
after class. And before lunch. And after 
lunch, and during conversation and after 
sex. Actually, thats just a couple of the 
things I like about cigarettes.
I like the fact that I can meet someone 
new by bumming a cigarette or a light. I 
like how smoking somehow always stimu
lates conversation. I like having a favorite 
flavor (Ports!) and trying new brands.
Of course, these are all the things my 
addiction tells me. I tend to forget the 
necessary evils of smoking including the 
overall feeling of illness; the morning lunghacking session; the sudden and 
unexplicable loss of money from my wal
let; the inability to focus for longer than 
two hours without having to think about 
smoking; and the needless, painful min
utes sucking on a cold, wet butt trying to 
convince myself that the cigarette warms 
me against the biting winds and freezing 
sleetwhich brings me to the point of this 
editorial.
If you are a smoker, you should already
know what I am about to say. Almost 
every smoking CMU student has asked 
themselves at least once, Where could I 
go on-campus to hang out and smoke ciga
rettes with my friends inside, away from 
the horrible Pittsburgh weather? The 
answer is a dismal and bleak wind from 
the administration  stay in your room or 
pay money. The only places available are
spending hours in Highlander poking at 
rubbery food-like things, pretending to be 
getting some nourishment and suffocat
ing myself in glorious carbon monoxide 
and nicotine. And even though I couldnt 
smoke in my own room freshman year, I 
had enough freshman friends with smok
ing rooms that it didnt bother me. Now 
that I live off-campus and have no meal
dormitories (assuming your roommate 
consents), fraternaties (assuming youre 
allowed in) and one small room in High
lander cafeteria (assuming you feel smok
ing is worth five dollars).
Back when I was a freshman and had a 
meal plan it didnt bother me so much that 
the only time I could smoke inside with 
friends was meal time. I just ended up
plan, there is nowhere I can go. I dont 
even have on-campus friends with smok
ing rooms (well, not many). Im sure as 
hell not going to suffer through another 
Highlander meal, cost and all, just to have 
the freedom to smoke (although it almost 
makes sense). Which means that if I ever 
do break and lose the battle I have no 
choice but to sit outside at the mercy of the
tempermental weather.
Im pretty sure this situation is caused 
by the misconception that cigarette smok
ing is a choice and addictions are easy to 
fight. Addictions are not things you want 
to do and can decide to ignore for a little 
while.
Addictions take over your life if you 
ignore them, and never go away. Trust 
me. Its been two months, and I still have 
that craving to puff on a fag. It is true 
that it is a choice to start smoking ciga
rettes, but many smokers like me started 
back when we were impressionable youths 
and unaware (or unbelieving) of the con
sequences.
Beyond the fact that we are punished 
by the addiction every day after the first, 
we are ostracized by uncaring and unin
formed non-smokers.
I remember back when it was special to 
have a non-smoking section in a restau
rant. Now all I ask for is a smoking 
section in the University Center. Its a 
pretty simple solution. All thats required 
is one hole (maybe five) in the basement 
equipped with couches and ventilation to 
the outside. We wont bother anybody 
else. I promise. I just hope that no one 
else has to have the experience of trying 
to take a drag from your cigarette which 
has fallen in the snow because your fin
gers are too. numb from the cold.

__________Rebecca Fribush
I was going to start writing this 
much earlier. I had it all planned 
out and was so thrilled about how 
well-organized I was going to be.
But then I decided to check my 
email. Naturally, I had to respond 
to everything.
Then I had to talk to someone 
across the hall. Then I realized 
that my textbooks were lined up 
crookedly, and there was no way 
I could concentrate if I didnt 
straighten them out right then 
and there. Then I got hungry. 
And then....
Wait a second  where was I? 
Oh yes, I was about to expound 
on the evil habits of procrastina
tion and time-wasting and how 
they deviously filch time away 
from productive work.
No one is free from their 
clutches ... especially not here.
The simple avoiding-work-bydoing-everything-but-what-youshould-be-doing strategy is a fact 
of life at colleges everywhere. 
Naturally you can find this at 
Carnegie Mellon.
But CMU students have also 
pioneered a much more techno
logically advanced way to get 
nothing accomplishedthe frittering-away-time-at-the-computer technique. There are so 
many tempting things to do with 
a computer that just arent avail
able elsewhere. For instance, you
can organize your email by the 
geographical location of the 
sender.
You can have all sorts of fun 
with all the foreign letters the 
more complicated word proces
sors make available. Well, no, I 
never said these were particu
larly worthwhile or interesting 
things to do just that they beat 
actual work. If youre really lucky, 
your computer can waste your 
time without your participation. 
Mine recently decided to eat my 
half-finished, due-the-next-day 
English essay as a midnight 
snack. I spent 30 minutes trying 
to find the document, another 30 
complaining after I realized it 
had already been digested, and 
an hour trying to reconstruct what 
I had written. So that was two 
hours spent producing nothing 
without even trying to procrasti
nate!
To be fair, my computers con
duct probably wouldnt have been 
quite so moving if I hadnt waited 
until midnight to finish the pa
per in the first place.
Time-wasting, like any other 
addiction, starts slowly and 
sneaks up on you.
You plan to start that big paper 
in a few minutes. The minutes 
go by, then pile into hours, and 
the next thing you know, its 
roughly 1:19 am and youre star
ing blearily at a blank computer 
screen.
Stop me when this begins to 
sound familiar.
Half a can of Jolt and a bag of 
stale potato chips later, you print 
out your work (bee shore to katch 
those late-nite spellengmistekes 
befour you do this) and crawl into
bed... as the first brilliant rays of 
dawn stream through your win
dow.
You sleep covered only by the 
cheap sheets of paper on which 
your report is printed. After all, 
youve done so much to bring the 
wretched thing into this world 
that surely it should make itself 
useful to you somehow. Besides, 
youre much too tired to pull your 
blanket down.
The next day (or, rather, at a 
more reasonable hour of that 
same day) you earn the respect of 
your entire class for having the 
darkest circles under your eyes. 
Still radiant from this honor, you 
stagger back to your room and 
realize theres just no way you 
can focus on work in your ex
hausted state.
Youll do all your homework, 
you swear, right after you relax 
for a little while.... Get the pat
tern?
Come to think of it, you prob
ably know exactly what I mean by 
wasting time. Arent you spend
ing your time reading this in
stead of doing what you should 
be?
Come on, get to work. But just 
in case you cant break the habit 
of staying up until dawn, keep in 
mind that newsprint makes a 
much sturdier bedcover than com
puter paper.

history major. She blames any 
errors or inconsistencies in this

made injurious comments 
to the president.
So much for investigative 
reportingthe press handled 
this like its investigation of 
any other Clinton scandal: no 
investigation at all. Funny 
how the media deny being 
biased.
The simple truth of the 
matter here is that Clinton 
somehow thinks he is above 
the law (which should not 
corne as a surprise to anyone, 
considering the number of 
laws he and his staff have 
broken in their short tenure). 
He had those people locked 
up just because they said 
something he didnt like.
If I recall correctly we do 
have a notable section of the 
Constitution called the First 
Amendment.
Let me quote it to you 
(maybe you can pass it along 
to Clinton, since he seems to 
need a refresher course).
Congress shall make no law 
respecting an establishment 
of religion, or prohibiting the 
free exercise thereof; or abridg
ing the freedom of speech, or 
of the press; or the right of the 
people peaceably to assemble, 
and to petition the government 
for a redress of grievances.
On its face, the idea of free 
speech seems pretty straight
forward. Why doesnt Clinton 
understand it?
He felt pretty assured that
it applied during the non-inhaling protestor days of his youth. 
Maybe its just the typical left
ist position that free speech is 
only their right.
Of course this isnt the first 
time Clinton has done such a 
thing. People have been ar
rested before for saying things 
he didnt like. There were two 
cases in 1993 when individuals 
were arrested after confronting 
Clinton about his waffling on 
the middle-class tax cut that he 
had promised. Both of these 
people ended up being released.
Can someone please explain 
to me how anyone can support 
this man? He doesnt care about 
us, and he is vindictive in that 
he makes people pay for annoy
ing him. Im sorry, but last time 
I checked, we had a president 
and not a king.
His blatant disregard for ba
sic rights is more than enough 
reason to dislike the man, even 
leaving out his consistent in
ability to tell the truth or hold 
any convictions (though there 
may be convictions in his fu
ture).
The man is simply a scoun
drel, and the ability of the 
American public to view him 
with anything but scorn contin
ues to amaze me.

The fact that the Tartans won their fourth game of the season normally isnt too much of a big deal, 
but this game marked a milestone in CMU history. The Tartan win against Rhodes college will forever 
be remembered as the 400th win in the history of Carnegie Mellon football. Carnegie no longer plays 
in the national football light that it once did, playing teams such as the University of Pittsburgh, North 
Carolina, West Virginia, and Notre Dame, but it is still held as a football power in their current Division 
III. Carnegie Mellon has a history of outstanding wins against some of these current national competitors 
in the larger divisions. Some of Carnegie Mellons most outstanding victories are:
they are the foot soldiers, regu- I 
lars, grunts, expendables, can- I 
non fodder, the infantry.
I always imagined lineback
ers as tanks. Probably because ; 
whenever they blitz the quarterback, I picture a German 
Panzer division rushing into 
Czechoslovakia.
Since the defensive second- ; 
ary is considered the last line of , 
defense, we might decide they \ 
are army reserves. Thats not \ 
very flattering, though.
This analogy is starting to ! 
break down. While its distinct ! 
for some players (picture de- ; 
fensive ends as invading  
armies, sacking quarterbacks ! 
like cities), its lousy for others.

recovery then led to senior wide

ing first start with a 33-yard
Tartans shut out Rhodes 17-0
touchdown pass, and no inter
ceptions. He was 3-3 passing.
The Tartan rushing game was 
effective, but not very consistent. 
The Tartans utilized seven different 
ball carriers for a total of 149 rushing 
yards, and 56 yards passing.
The Tartans kicking game 
brought points home, too. In the 
third quarter, with four minutes 
and 37 seconds left in the quar
ter, freshman kicker Pat OMalley

drive to points with a field goal. 
Going into the fourth, the score 
was 10-0. Senior punter Frank 
Triggiani had a great game also. 
He was on the field for a total of 
eight punts, for an average of 37 
yards per punt, with the longest 
being 48 yards. The Tartans 
kicking game was much stron
ger than in the past, which aided 
the defense tremendously. 
Where our kicking game was 
strong and solid, Rhodess 
wasnt quite as good, and that 
really made a difference, 
said coach Rich Lackner. Es
pecially with the dropped ball 
by the Rhodes punter; that 
was a big recovery.
While the punting was 
strong, the fact that they had 
to punt eight times isnt al
ways a good sign for the of
fense. The Tartans are still 
faring poorly on third-down 
conversions; 5-15 in this past 
game. Without converting to 
the first down, the Tartan 
offense is leaving the field 
open for the other team to 
monopolize on their lack of
yardage. Even though the Tar
tans won, Rhodes had 245 total 
yards to the Tartans 205; a 56- 
yard difference.
Although the figures dont tell 
a good story, the defense played 
very well. They forced four 
fumbles, and held Rhodes to a 
shut-out. This included the in
credible red-zone defense that 
forced the ball to be turned over 
on downs late in the fourth quar
ter. Another big part of the 
Tartans win was the overall time 
of possession. The Tartans had 
the ball for almost a full seven 
minutes more than Rhodes. 
Lackner said, Time of posses
sion is a big part of it... you want 
to keep the ball out of the other 
teams hands for as long as pos
sible, and try to score.
The Tartans enjoyed a welldeserved win this past Saturday. 
They are playing away at 
Dickinson College next Saturday.
[Ed. Note  Please see the 
CMU football history on page 9 
for further information on the 
Tartans 400th win.]

Pundit Part II
by Chris Cannon
It took seven long years, from 1976 to 
1983, for Luke Skywalker to finally become 
a Jedi Knight. We saw him mature from the 
young, unrefined farm boy in Star Wars, an 
eager but impatient warrior in The Empire 
Strikes Back, and finally completed his meta
morphosis into the focused veteran in The 
Return of the Jedi. This concerns pro-foot - 
ball fans because in the NFL, the quarter
back is the jedi knight who leads the team 
and forces them to victory.
Nearly every successful quarterback in 
the past ten years has been carefully cul
tivated like a Jedi Knight. The best coaches 
have cautiously kept them back for awhile 
before throwing them into the mix. No
where is this more evident than last 
Sundays results.
The young quarterbacks that were handpicked and groomed by the Yodas and ObiWans of the league excelled, while those
that went the quick, easy way (to the Dark 
side) floundered.
Quarterbacks Mark Brunell, Elvis Grbac, 
Brett Favre, Mike Tomzack, and Dave Krieg 
represent a wide quality for comparision 
and contrast. Each player led their team to 
victory, each was not a starter during their 
rookie year, each is at a different point in 
their career, and it can be argued that they 
are of varying degrees of talent.
Brunell, in his third year and the most 
athletic of the group, has been brought 
along slowly but surely. He split time as a 
starter in college and learned the ropes 
with the expansion Jaguars last year be
fore coming into his own. He leads the 
league in passing yards.
Elvis, perhaps the best passer in the en
tire league (and the man who would be king), 
is another that has been slowly graced for 
the starting roler'Coming off their first loss 
of the season, Grbac lead San Francisco to 
their highest point total of the year. In his 
fourth year, the 49ers backup is better than 
the starter, two-time MVP Steve Young.
Last seasons MVP Favre is on his way again. 
But the Favre of this season and last is nothing 
like the excitable farm boy who first arrived in 
Green Bay. The Packer coaching staff has in
stilled the power of the force in this one.
Tomzack was a one-time starter in Chi
cago, but has found new life in Pittsburgh. 
Tomzack is an example of a man that has 
twice grown into the role of leading man. If
an example of how to best cultivate patience 
and persistance in a quarterback is needed, 
look no further.
Comparatively, of the quarterbacks that 
have been thrown into the starting ranks 
their rookie years, few fare well against the 
stormtrooper defenses of the 90s. Rick Mirer, 
Seattles four year starter, threw three in
terceptions in the first half en route to an
other loss. The most recent hope, Drew 
Bledsoe (another four-year starter), has 
sparked at times, but mostly fizzles. St. 
Louis continues to experiment with rookie 
Tony Banks, bul continues to lose and Trent 
Dilfer, a third year quarterback in Tampa 
Bay, was shutout.
While the best teams know exactly when 
to insert their young guns (San Francisco 
with Steve Young), others wait too long to 
pull the trigger. The third overall pick from 
two years ago, Steve McNair, rode the bench 
again as Houston lost to the Steelers. The 
Steelers have a winner in Tomzack, but 
Kordell Stewart has untapped potential as 
quarterback. Minnesota is leading the cen
tral. Backup Brad Johnson has pulled them 
out of two games but continues to ride the 
pine. Just as these players come into their 
prime, they may be ready to jump to a team 
with a vinning record.
Chris Cannon is a junior computer science 
major. Heisagod  not THE God, but pretty 
cool anyway.
Baseball guru relates obscure tales of 96
The Hot Comer
by Matt Cuccaro
The 1996 season provided base
ball fans nationwide with a spec
tacular season filled with mile
stone accomplishments, thrilling 
pennant races, andrecord-breaking performances. As we say good
bye to the regular season and 
welcome the playoffs, let us re
flect on some of the more impor
tant and meaningful events of 
the year which you may not have 
heard of.
Congratulations to Paul Molitor 
for collecting career hit number 
3,000. The Minnesota Twins des
ignated hitter became the 20th 
player to reach the milestone 
when he tripled to right on Sep
tember 16 in a game against the 
Kansas City Royals. After the 
game, Molitor admitted feeling 
relieved that the countdown to 
3,000 was over.
No player experienced more 
relief, though, than did the Redss 
Chris Sabo when he removed the 
3,000th and final splinter he got 
when shattering Hal Morris 
corked bat in a game earlier this 
year. Sabo credited Preparation 
H as the key to his ability to play 
with the pain as he phrased it.
On September 17, the Dodg
erss Hideo Nomo threw the firstever no-hitter in Colorados Coors
Field. The game was not only an 
outstanding and rare accomplish
ment, but the victory also in

Senior defensive tackle Todd McManus, senior inside linebacker Ray Ardire, and senior inside linebacker Jarrod McAdoo prepare to pummel the Rhodes ball carrier, with quick assistance from senior nose guard 
Damian Jones and junior outside linebacker Josh Stauffer.

Tartan Assistant Sports Editor
Approximately 800 fans were sitting 
in the rain this past Saturday in Gesling 
Stadium for the Tartans football game 
against Rhodes college. It was cold and 
very damp 1 a vague reminder of last
years season-ending game versus Case 
Western in what seemed like a monsoon
 but the turnout was much more excit
ing in the Rhodes game. The Tartans 
won 17-0, with no turnovers.
The Tartans came into this game with 
much more enthusiasm than in the past 
few games. Going into this game, the
Tartans were 1-2, and 0-1 in the divi
sion, and had recently seemed to have a 
problem playing with the enthusiasm 
that they needed to win games. Well, the 
enthusiasm didnt seem to pose much of 
a problem this week, with the Tartans 
recovering two of the four fumbles that 
they caused, and also picking up two
interceptions. Sophomore Jason Funke 
and senior captain Ray Ardire both had 
interceptions, and Ardire ran his back 
for a touchdown in the fourth quarter, 
putting a major damper on Rhodess 
chances of coming back to win. This last 
touchdown meant that Rhodes would 
need three touchdowns to take control of
the game, and in the final minutes of the 
fourth quarter, the chances of that hap- L 
penihg were.slim to none.
The first points of the game were a 
result of a punt that was dropped by the 
Rhodes punter and recovered by sopho

Mills, Sun advance to national competition
By MASHA KVARSKY
Tartan Junior Staff writer
If you hear someone say that 
there is nothing exciting happen
ing at CMU, just tell them they 
are wrong. The start of this sea
son has been outstanding for both 
the mens and womens tennis 
teams. Competing with some of 
the toughest teams in their divi
sion, the teams hold winning 
records of 3-1 and 3-2. Lead by 
coach Peter Moss, the teams have 
been showing great improvement 
and startling ability from their 
star players Keri Mills and 
Navroze Marshall. Playing chal
lenging opponents, the tennis 
teams have displayed good 
unity and skills as well as a 
conquering attitude.
This weekend, the womens ten
nis team participated in the Rolex 
Northeast Regional Collegiate 
Tennis Championships for 
Women held at William Smith 
College. Both Mills and fresh
man Christina Sun 
advanced to the cham
pionship match, and 
Mills won 6-0, 6-2.
The two players then 
teamed up to take the 
doubles qhampionship. Both Sun and 
Mills will represent 
CMU at the Rolex 
National Small Col
lege Championships 
in Memphis, Tennesse 
on October 24-27.
Mills, who won the 
Rolex Regional last 
year and took second 
place at the National, 
was looking forward 
to another victory. 
Sophomore Jillian 
Watkins, third in the 
. line-up, says Mills 
plays like a beast, and 
has a lot of confidence 
in her game this sea
son. In the last Rolex,
Mills and Watkins The men!
were doubles partners and took 
fourth place. This year, Mills has 
a new partner, Sun (#2). Sun is 
very dedicated, enthusiastic and 
Mills has called her a strong 
player. On September 22, the 
team competed against Roches
ter and Brockport. These matches 
were more team-centered, unlike 
the Rolex tournament, which is 
an individual competition.
Rochester, which is one of the 
strongest teams in the third divi
sion, has been CMUs biggest ri
val. It is one of the strongest teams 
we will play all year, and we came 
very close to beating it last year. 
Mills, who is the #1 singles and 
doubles player on the team, and 
the team captain, says that their 
victory partly depended on atti
tude. She played exceptionally 
and won the singles match and 
the doubles match during the 
tournament against Rochester. 
The Carnegie Mellon Tennis Clas
sic, held at CMU two weeks ago, 
showed the entire team at its
best. Watkins said that it boosted 
up the teams confidence. Since 
Mills and Sun didnt play, the 
others played above their usual 
position in the line-up and still 
succeeded. Watkins and senior 
Michelle Cook took the first 
doubles place in the tournament. 
.Watkins said [Cook] and I are 
new at playing together, but we 
did well anyway. Cook is fifth in 
the line-up. She follows sopho
more Julie Balch (#4), whose part
ner is Miklane Fedorowich (#6). 
Watkins said, The team works 
well together. Mills agreed, 
saying, We motivate each 
other, rely on each other; its 
not all individual.
The mens tennis team also has 
some interesting competitions 
coming up. Next weekend, the 
men will compete at Swarthmore 
College in the Rolex Tournament. 
Marshall, a junior and captain of 
the team since last year, said 
that one of his goals is to go to the 
national Rolex competition. To
accomplish this, he and his 
doubles partner, junior Jim 
Freese, will have to fight some 
tough competition. Navroze 
commented that this has been 
a good, promising season.
In their past two matches, 
the team defeated Allegheny 
College, a competitor they have 
never beaten before. The Al
legheny and CMU teams have 
long been intense rivals. In the 
meet held at Rochester last 
week, the CMU team won the 
consolation team champion
ship, beating Allegheny 4-2 and 
Ithaca 4-3. After an early loss 
in the tournament, Marshall 
said the team came back nicely, 
winning in the singles and 
doubles matches. The line-up 
this year includes sophomore 
Amit Jaipuria (#2), and junior 
Dan Bilco (#3). Freese (#5), is 
the best doubles player on the 
team. A new addition to the 
team is freshmen Kevin Fine 
(#4). Marshall, as team cap
tain, sees Fine as a 
talented player who 
will move higher up 
in the line-up very 
soon. Freshman Apura 
Kothari (#6) was 
Freeses doubles partner last weekend 
when they beat Al
legheny.
One of the reasons 
the team is having 
such a successful sea
son is their ability to 
get along really well, 
according to Marshall. 
He said the team has 
greatly matured since 
last year, as their 
record shows.
This season has 
been rewarding for 
the CMU tennis 
teams and they are 
looking forward to a 
few more good tour
naments to finish theAnukul Kapoor/Tartan Junior Staff

Soccer wins pair

CMUs womens soccer team 
added another two wins to its 
record this week, with a 2-1 over
time win against Marietta on 
Wednesday and a 2-1 win against 
St. Marys College on Saturday. 
The team now has an extremely 
strong 5-1-1 overall record.
The game was at home on a raindampened field, which sped up 
the game and caused several play
ers to lose their footing. The
Sophomore backfielder Tracy 
Burton scored the second goal at 
41 minutes in a crowded play in 
front of St. Marys goal. Umeda 
and senior forward Mae Hogan 
assisted Burton in her goal, pass
ing the ball back and forth off a' 
corner kick until Burton shot 
the ball into the net.
Despite CMUs effective offen-1 
sive plays, it took the defense to 
win the game for the Tartans.

SMCs only score was on an overthe-head shot 14 minutes into the 
second half. Even though St. 
Marys had tightened its offense 
into the second half and played 
more aggressively, the team was 
no match for the Tartans.

Traditions build CMU history, spirit

Tartan Staffwriter
Fence provides mean for student expression
By ANDY SEYMOUR
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
As you look across the Cut, what stands out the most? Is it the 
leautiful green grass that always seems to be.covered with construcj tion equipment? Is it the trees that rise up along side it? Or is it the 
academic and administrative buildings thrown about all over cam)us? Most likely, youll probably walk away remembering, among 
other things, the Fence, one of the landmarks of the CMU campus.
Often referred to as a barometer of contemporary student activi
ties, the Fence is a landmark and a meeting ground for many 
students at CMU. The Fence, originally known as the Senior Fence, 
was erected in 1923 at the very spot where a bridge had formerly 
crossed a huge ravine separating Margaret Morrison Womens 
College from Carnegie Institute of Technology. The bridge allowed 
students from the all-male Carnegie Institute of Technology to meet 
romen from Margaret Morrison Womens College. After the ravine 
forever known as the Cut  was filled in and the bridge was taken 
down by the University in 1916, a group of outraged seniors built a 
fence as the new meeting ground.
However, the idea flopped, as the Fence just did not measure up to 
the former bridge, and the night before the University was going to 
iar it down, some fraternity brothers painted it as a prank, adverising a fraternity party. That party was a huge success, and ever 
since, painting the Fence has been a CMU tradition.
According to Stephanie Palmer, a senior at CMU working for the
Please See FENCE, page L12
Anyone who has ever taken a campus tour has heard about many 
of the traditions lingering on CMUs campus. You know to rub 
Hamerschlags nose for good luck and that the best place to play hideand-seek is in the steam tunnels. The tour guide surely pointed out 
the sloping halls of Baker and explained Andrew Carnegies plan to 
convert the building into an assembly plant if the school were to fail. 
It turns out that prudent Andrew was worried for no reason. His 
venture was a success, and through the years, CMU has developed 
an array of unique traditions, many with odd origins. Lisa Rump, a 
freshman H&SS undeclared major, says it is nice to know that the 
traditions exist. The campus is pretty diverse as it is, and [the 
traditions] are a way to unite the campus.
As interesting as some traditions may have seemed to students in 
the past, some have not survived the test of time. Senior men no 
longer wear hats with plaid bands, and senior women do not carry 
ornamented canes to show their status. The Class of2000 will be glad 
to hear that freshman hazing was discontinued in 1938 in favor of 
Orientation. Beginning with the schools second class, all freshmen 
were required to wear identifying beanies called dinks. Any plebe 
who failed to wear his dink was subject to punishment ranging from 
carrying a sophomores books to a paddling. This makes the meal 
bracelets worn by this years freshmen seem like less of an affliction.
CMUs charter class decided to adopt many Scottish rites and 
colors in honor of Andrew Carnegies heritage. Though our football 
team does not wear plaid uniforms, our official school color is tartan. 
Carnegie had an Edinburgh designer create a tartan especially for 
CMU, though today any plaid is usually substituted. Students 
opinions of the school color seem to range from indifference to polite, 
its unusual, but nobody seems to object to the choice of color, or 
pattern, that represents our school.
Our football team may not dress in plaid, but our marching band 
does wear kilts. The tradition began in 1920, when the drum major 
took it upon himself much to the envy of the other band members 
 to buy a kilt and a towering bearskin headdress. Eventually the 
student council secured enough funds to outfit the entire band in this 
manner and the first kilted version of Kiltie Band appeared in 1922

Greeks sponsor traditional 
community activities
By KENKWALIK
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Among the many traditions here at CMU are the ever-popular 
Greek traditions. While some of them we cannot discuss in print, 
most of them provide a fun opportunity for Greeks and non-Greeks 
alike to let loose and enjoy themselves.
Among the fraternities, Sigma Nu (Zoo) stages the annual mudslide
 a goopy, messy, and sometimes nude sliding tradition in front of 
their house. Usually after the Sweepstakes competition, brothers 
get out the water hose and start sliding in mud down the hill in front 
of their house. It lasts until the fun gets broken up when the Campus 
Police arrive.
And for those of you who are wondering who exactly started the 
Hawaii Five-O, its Phi Kappa Theta we can thank for this tradi
tion. Dating back to 1980, the brothers often sit on the ground at just 
about any social function and yell Stroke, stroke! imitating boat
men of long ago. Another tradition common to the fraternities is 
dumping various brothers/pledges/whomever in the flowers at 
Morewood or the dumpsters in the Quad, often while covered with 
liquids of various nature.
One of the most well-known Greek traditions is the annual theme 
party. During the fall rush period, the fraternities throw parties to get 
to know the new rushees and start off the school year. Theme parties

Pi Kappa Alpha decorates their fraternity house for the annual Toga 
theme party. Theme parties are fall rush events that occur annually.

Cambodian holocaust survivor recounts suffering
I think it was good to broaden my 
knowledge and everyone elses knowledge about what went on in Cambo. 
dia at the time of the Killing Fields. I 
find it amazing that he can get up 
there and recount what he went 
through and what his family went' 
through and how his nieces and neph
ews died without breaking down, said 
Tushar Dubey, a representative of 
the International Relations Organization and a junior economic policy 
and management major.
As a survivor, you owe something 
to the god or Buddha to which you 
prayed for survival. I think that God 
gave me life to become a messenger, 
said Pran.
He travels throughout the world to 
educate people about the horrors that 
occurred in Cambodia.
When I find a group of people 
around me like this, it makes my pain 
go away for a while and makes me 
feel important that people care..., I 
hope that someday the world commu
nity will wake up to the results that 
they get from the movie, from books, 
from the Cambodian survivors and 
the refugees.
It will help bring us justice, help us 
bring these criminals to court so we 
can learn why they did this to their 
own people, why they killed the chil
dren.
- Pran said, I want to tell the new 
generations to be careful, to not take 
[freedom] for granted. The holocaust 
could happen again.

Soup, it is said, is good food. Combine it with enlightened 
speakers and readers and you have Soup and Substance, the 
Student Life Offices regular series of presentations by influential 
and interesting people on an off-campus.
Last Tuesdays presentation, Places / Everyone, featured James 
Daniels, H&SS head of creative writing. He read selections from 
two of his books; M-80, and Places, Everyone as well as some of his 
newer work. Coupled with commentary on his home-life in Michi
gan, the exciting rhythm of an automobile assembly line, and 
the ghosts of those who threw themselves from the three 
bridges over Panther Hollow, Daniels words expressed dreams 
and sorrows of life.
The series has been produced monthly by Michael Groat, Coor
dinator for Student Life on the Hill. It receives funding from 
Student Affairs and the Student Activities fee and speakers are 
chosen by a group of eight Resident Assistants.Basically, we meet 
and try to think of people on campus who are doing interesting 
work, said Groat, Were looking for something they can share 
with the campus community.
"... we want something emotionally 
and intellectually nourishing. 
 Jim Daniels, Director of the 
Creative Writing Program
We try to base the talks around national or international event s 
as well as campus issues that come up over the course of the year. 
This semesters focus will be faculty in the arts. This will include 
presenters from many disciplines, creative writing being the first. 
Soup and Substance hopes to bring in violinists, actors, and 
playwrights, among others, to discuss and perhaps present a short 
example of their work.
We also have three lectures for October, said Groat. These w:ll 
focus on Latin-American issues in order and will be tied into the 
International Festival. Our first speaker, scheduled October 1 o, 
with be Dr. Eric Langer who will speak on Latin-Americ;m 
religion.These three lectures will supplement the regular monthly 
series. Daniels presentation was very well attended. We had a 
bigger crowd than we started with this year, which is exciting. 
Were hoping to increase awareness of the series and make it more 
visible on campus.
It isnt our goal to make it seem like an onerous lecture. Instead, 
we want something emotionally and intellectually nourishing. 
These are presentations more than lecture, said Daniels.
And there is the soup. The student committee generally recom
mends a vegetarian soup, said Groat, We try to please as many 
people as possible.

The Art Department kicked 
off its lecture series last Thurs
day with an appearance by 
Miroslaw Rogala, a video and 
multimedia artist from Chicago 
whose work triggers a variety 
of responses no matter where 
it is displayed. Rogala tries to 
incorporate spectators into his 
pieces in order to create inter
active experiences.
These mixed emotions, how
ever, seem to be a key element 
in the messages he tries to con
vey, such as in a piece con
structed in Chicago entitled 
Electronic Garden / 
NatuRealization, which is an 
expression of the importance 
of free speech.
Unfortunately, the piece, a 
frame of metal that points 
speakers at viewers standing 
within it and, with infrared 
light sensors, played speeches 
on cue, did not invoke many 
responses in the CMU audi
ence other than confusion, in
difference handful of ques
tions regarding construction, 
motives, and titles.
Technical difficulties with 
the equipment seemed to dis
appoint much of the audience.
Everybody was either re
ally restless, sleeping, or talk

the Art Department. Jon 
Beckley, associate professor of 
art at CFA and chairman of the 
Lecture Series committee, said 
that thedepartment hopes to 
reach a broader audience by 
choosing a great variety of art
ists for the lecture. The stu
dents in our program are di
versified, he said. This pro
gram allows students to see 
how an artist lives and works, 
how an artist functions in soci
ety, how an artist can be seen 
as somebody thats exploring 
new territory in the arts, all of 
them for the most part having 
come from traditional back
grounds.
The program, which is funded 
in part by the Elizabeth Th
ompson and Thomas M. Cox, 
A29, Distinguished Artist 
Fund, attempts to reach as 
many students as possible by 
bringing in different artists so 
that at least some will be rel
evant to some students work. 
Similarly, art historians, crit
ics, and critical theorists 
complement the artists work 
and provide a basis for non
artists to appreciate the lec
tures as well.
It is an exciting way for 
someone whos not an artist to 
be acquainted with the human
ness of artists, said Jon 
Beckley. In addition, a greater 
incentive for students to at
tend, is that the artists gener
ally deal with humanistic is
sues, and have different ideas 
on the purpose of art.
For example, one major issue 
in this semesters lecture se
ries is the artists role in soci
ety and how to involve the com
munity in art.

way. Despite the variety of re
actions that the lectures pro
voke, most seem to feel it is a 
good way to become better ac

I go to the lectures because 
its important to keep up with 
the contemporary art scene  
to know what artists are dis
playing now and how theyre 
doing it, said Amy Marino, a 
junior art major. She said an
other asset to attending lec

lectures here are a little less 
formal than lectures you might

opportunity to talk to an artist

held, as well as the fall line-up

 Dith Pran, Cambodian 
Holocaust survivor
By RHONDA GILLESPIE
Tartan Staffwriter
Cambodians can starve, but if you let 
them have freedom, theyre never going 
to die, said Dith Pran, a survivor of the 
Cambodian holocaust whose experiences 
were portrayed in the award-winning 
film, The Killing Fields. Pran lectured 
in the Rangos Ballroom last Tuesday. 
The International Relations Organiza
tion and the World Affairs Council of 
Pittsburgh sponsored Prans visit.
Dith Pran has lived history. He is a 
remarkable man who, I think, defines
the word courage,  said George R. 
Savarese, the education director at the 
World Affairs Council of Pittsburgh.
Pran recounted the history of his na
tive country during the Vietnam War 
and rule by the communist Khmer 
Rouge, and spoke of his experiences 
under the Khmer Rouge. Most of his 
family was killed and he was thrown 
out of his home and sent to work in a 
forced labor camp along with many of 
his fellow Cambodians.
In a time when over 2 million of his 
countrymen died, either shot in the 
streets by the leaders of the regime or
killed by starvation or disease, Pran 
considers himself lucky to have sur
vived. You survive because you are 
meant to survive, he said.
Pran said after more than 20 years, 
things have still not returned to nordeath, said verBerg.
The International Relations Orga
nization estimated that a crowd of 
over 90 people attended Prans lec
ture. Many said they had little knowl
edge of the Cambodian situation.

mal in Cambodia. Many of the Cambo
dian leaders responsible for the Kill
ing Fields are being granted amnesty 
by the current administration.
So Pran waits. He emphasized main
taining patience, trusting that the gov
ernment will punish those responsible 
for the Cambodian holocaust in due 
time.
He said, I got angry before, but 
then Id think, What for? Even if I 
get too angry, I cannot get my family 
back.
I never worry about being assassi
nated, Pran said. I have done 
enough. My life can inform the world 
about what is going on.

Student resents negative meaning of feminism
CRACKING THE MYTH
by Martha Sullivan
Western culture has progressed to the 
point where women arent always ex
pected to be housewives, where they can 
vote, hold positions of power, and even 
drink and smoke in front of people. There 
wouldnt be any women studying, pro
fessing, or administrating at Carnegie 
Mellon if it werent for feminists who
saw no reason for women to be excluded 
from academia. We would all probably 
be sitting in our parents houses, doing 
needle point, waiting for that special 
man to take care of us for the rest of our 
lives if it werent for that basic ideal of 
equality that we feel should include us. 
Thats feminism. It seems only logical to 
me that every woman who is here at 
CMU, to learn and prepare for a career, 
is a feminist for wanting those things, 
thinking she deserves them, and expect
ing them for herself. But it worries me 
that the word feminism has come to 
mean something that many young 
women dont want to identify themselves 
with.
Well, Im not a feminist, but... I 
wouldnt call myself a feminist... I 
believe in womens rights and all, but
Im not a feminist. Well, why not? How 
has the word feminism come to be treated 
with such disdain just as the ideals that 
comprise feminism are beginning to in
filtrate the dominant ideology? Perhaps 
its because those ideals are viewed as a 
threat to the power structure constructed 
by paternalistic white conservatives.
For many people, the word feminist 
means militant man-hating lesbian, 
but that only describes the smallest seg
ment of the feminist population. Its not 
an image that bears any real likeness to 
the majority of feminists, and it cer
tainly wasnt a feminist who imposed 
this image on the face of feminism. These 
negative connotations serve only to 
weaken feminist credibility and make 
feminism seem unappealing to a new 
generation of women. So where did this
image come from and why do so many 
people subscribe to it? The answer to 
that question is another; who would 
benefit from a weakened feminist move
ment?
As sexism, racism, and homophobia 
become less and less acceptable, the 
conservative patriarchy weakens. When 
the conservative patriarchy feels threat
ened, it tries to undermine the progress 
of civil rights movements through de
vices such as bad press. Just as racist 
reporting of news subtly influences 
people against a higher standard of ra
cial tolerance, the power of feminism is 
being usurped through a slippage in 
language.
Most people know by now that stereo
types rarely reflect reality, but instead 
reflect sets of negatively skewed conno
tations imposed on the other in order to 
contain it. By subscribing to the nega1- 
tive connotations forced upon feminism , 
we are only helping the man to disarm 
the feminist movement. Feminism gets 
its power through unity. Break the 
unity, and you break the power.
If you love and respect women, you are 
a feminist. If you believe that women 
should enjoy the same opportunities and 
privileges that men do, you are a femi
nist. If you believe that people should be 
allowed to live in the manner that they 
choose and not let their roles in society 
be dictated by their genitalia, then you 
are a feminist.
Are you a feminist?

and cultural studies major.

, N.J., September 30 
With annual tuition and fees at 
University this year costing 
ich as a Ford Explorer, no one 
accuse the Ivy League school of 
a bargain.
| But at a time when the cost of attend
ing US colleges and universities is grow
ing at three times the rate of inflation, 
some creative cost-cutting measures 
have found their way to even the most 
estigious and wealthy schools.
For the 1996-97 school year, 
Princetons tuition, room and board, and 
related fees will total $28,325. But de
spite the platinum price, a Princeton 
education this year will cost just 4.6 
percent more than last year  the low
est increase in tuition in 30 years.
 After allowing annual double-digit 
increases in the 1980s, universities are 
now striving to do what Princeton has 
(one: keep tuition increases below five 
jjercent. Harvard and Yale did it this 
Sear, and the University of California 
system managed to keep its 1996 tuition 
at the 1995 level.
:>! Moderating the rate of increase of 
Princetons tuition is the No. -1 prior
ity of this president, Howard Shapiro, 
and the board of trustees, says
Princeton spokeswoman Jacquelyn 
Savani. Its perhaps proof that higher 
education is becoming a luxury when 
five percent increases  still twice the 
inflation rate  are cause for celebra
tion. But with the cost of technology 
and competitive professors salaries, 
combined with scarce public dollars 
and declining enrollment due to a 
baby bust, five percent 
is about as good as it 
gets, says David 
Merkowitz of the Ameri
can Council on Educa
tion. Historically, in
creases in college tuition  
have always outstripped 
inflation.
At Princeton, department heads were 
required to cut their budgets by July 1. 
The school enacted hiring pauses, in 
which secretarial vacancies were left 
open for three to six months, and a 
hiring frost among high-salaried ad
ministrators. This meant that if a posi
tion became vacant, the school would try 
to eliminate it.
When the director of development left, 
the position was erased. When the 
speechwriter became provost, the 
speech-writing position was cut. The
question was: Does Howard Shapiro re
ally need a speech writer? Savani says.
More schools are asking similar ques
tions as they come under attack for al
lowing tuition to soar beyond the reach 
of average students. A General Account
ing Office report released last month 
found that average tuition costs at fouryear public colleges leapt 234 percent
A ... report released last month found 
that average tuition costs at four-year 
public colleges lept 234 percent....
between 1980 and 1995; household in
come and consumer price inflation rose 
82 and 74 percent, respectively, in the 
same 15 years. The report blamed rising 
administrative and research expenses, 
due to a 14-percent drop in state aid 
since 1980 on a greater reliance on tu
ition as a revenue source.
As concerns spread that middle-income students will be priced out of an 
education, efforts by schools to moder
ate prices and attract students  with
out risking quality  have become a 
new mantra. In 1994, Michigan State
University, in East Lansing, introduced 
the MSU tuition guarantee, in which 
tuition increases over the ensuing five, 
years would not exceed inflation.
Some schools give targeted discounts 
of up to $5,000 a year to children of 
alumni or in-state students. Others, 
such as St. John Fisher College in 
Rochester, N.Y., and the University of 
Missouri at Rolla, are 
guaranteeing jobs after 
graduation.
A few schools are even 
cutting tuition.
Muskingum College (New 
 - Concord, Ohio) and North 
Carolina Wesleyan Col
lege (Rocky Mount, N.C.) reduced rates 
by 29 and 23 percent, respectively. Tech
nically, neither school really cut tuition. 
Instead, they ended a decade-old practice 
of discounting  charging higher tu
ition but then giving most students back 
a portion through financial aid.
Muskingum decided to cut its $13,850 
tuition by $4,000, dropping it below the 
psychological $10,000 barrier, but then 
cut the $4,000 financial aid grants it had 
been giving to three-fourths of its stu
dents.
Still, the school has garnered wide
spread attention for the move.
Enrollment in this years freshman class 
was 390, up from 288 last year, and the 
college is suddenly showing up on a num
ber of best-buy lists. College of New 
Jersey (formerly Trenton State Univer
sity) also found its way onto Money 
magazines annual list of best college val
ues. The No. 5 ranking came after admin
istrators recently defined a core mission 
providing a quality education for about 
$10,000 a yearand stripped the school 
of any excess programs that didnt help 
meet that goal.
Sparsely attended courses are now of
fered once a year, not twice, and continuing-education programs deemed costly 
and distracting were cut. Such trimming 
helped the school keep this years tuition 
increase to 4.8,percent. Were at a time 
when governors and even candidates for 
president of the United States are acting 
not just to level out taxes, but to cut 
taxes, says President Harold Eickoff, 
who relies on state funding for two-thirds 
of his budget.
If the money doesnt come from the 
state, it has to come from somewhere. 
And if the state funding goes (down), 
youre forced to go to tuition increases to 
keep up the quality of what you do.

BOSTON, Sept. 25  For Boston University freshmen Laura ! 
Drossman and Adriann Diers, campus living is a lot better than 1 
they expected. No running down the hall from the shower wrapped \ 
only in a towel: The two have their own private bath. They have yet ! 
to make their bedsthe maid does that. Cable television and HBO !! 
are standard. And if they feel like a swim, the heated pool is never J 
crowded.
Sound more like a hotel than a dorm? It is. Boston University, like ] 
many colleges in New Englands Ivy-League belt, has found itself I! 
this fall with too many students and not enough beds. The schools j 
solution: house the overflow at nearby hotels and rent space at a 
neighboring college.
Such arrangements may be fine with students, but with room j 
rates running upward of $4,000 a year at some colleges, parents | 
may be wondering if theyre getting their moneys worth or if j 
academic performance is affected by 24-hour access to HBO. Not | 
since the early 1980s have colleges here and across the country seen ! 
their campuses so bulging at the seams. Larger freshmen classes, i 
higher student demand for on-campus housing, and schools inabil- , j 
ity to predict the number of accepted freshmen who will actually ' 
enroll have contributed to the housing crunch.
Now, as then, universities are converting double-occupancy rooms ! 
into triples, turning game rooms into suites, or checking students i; 
into a local hotel or YMCA. Boston University, for example, put 334 !! 
freshmen at two Howard Johnsons and 224 in dorms borrowed from ;! 
Emmanuel College.
It may not have a dining service, but the room service is great, 1 
jokes Ms. Drossman, as she tacks up a poster of Tom Cruise. Most ;! 
college housing directors say its debatable whether students suffer ! 
academically because of make-do arrangements. Weve tried all ! 
those things. All of it was awful, says Gary Schwarzmueller, who ! 
for 20 years was housing director at the Georgia Institute of ,i 
Technology in Atlanta. Students in triples are unhappy, he says, ! 
and those living off campus in a motel psychologically think it is on ! 
the moon.Still, hes found that while satisfaction levels may drop .' 
when students are packed in like sardines, their academic perfor- 11 
mance generally remains steady.
But thats not somethingyou can sell, quips Mr. Schwarzmueller, ;  
now executive director of the Association of College and University ! 
Housing Officers International in Columbus, Ohio.
Expectations are much higher than they used to be.
In New England alone, Brown University, Wellesley College, the '  
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Boston College are all  
reporting crowded housing. Elsewhere, Purdue University in West :' 
Lafayette, Ind., had to refer some students to fraternities to 1
contend with the overflow. Georgia Tech, which converted part of '
the Olympic Village into student housing, had no trouble filling its 
2,800 new beds this fall.
Why the surging demand for housing? For one, enrollments are '
rising at some schools, in part because there are now more college- '
age students. Universities have spruced up their accommodations, 1
too, so more students are opting to live on campus. Increasingly, !
dorms are wired for the Internet, and many have cable hookup and 
digital voicemail. Some schools will even match roommates on the ! 
basis of study habits or room-tidiness.
But a bigger reason is colleges difficulty anticipating how many ; 
of the students they accepted will actually enroll. Union College in !! 
Schenectady, N.Y., was planning for an entering class of about 510, !
but 600 accepted its offer of admission.
Often, schools can solve the problem within two weeks, after 
making adjustments for no-shows. But many colleges this year are ' 1
looking for longer-term solutions. The University of Delaware in I
Newark turned 151 doubles into triples by adding a bunk bed and 1
an extra desk to each.
It also converted 10 lounges into triples. For the inconvenience, 
each student receives an $18-a-week rebate. Still, it expects that j
half of those students will be in permanent housing by the end of the 1
first semester, says Linda Carey, manager of housing services. 
Come spring, she says, normal attrition will even create some j 
vacancies. Boston University, too, knew it wasnt going to get any 
breathing room until next semester. Enter Howard Johnsons.
In some ways, this eight-story building doubles well as a college :
dorm. BU bulletin boards adorn the hallways. Resident assistants I 
and a resident counselor occupy each floor. But because Ho Jos still 
rents out a few rooms, rules are strictly enforced. No loitering in the : 
halls. No loud music. No hanging things on doors. For roommates  
Drossman and Ms. Diers, the only complaints are that the maid 
wakes them up Saturday mornings and that the ration of women to 
men is 10 to 1.
They're not going to take it anymore....

Helen was the promised beauty as a reward for Paris, for choosing Aphrodite, 
the Goddess of Love & Beauty in a beauty contest of Olympian goddesses.
Paris and Helen fled Sparta and were married now.
But the Achaeans (ancient Greeks) were ready to attack and ransack Troy, 
using Helen's abduction as an excuse.
One by one, all of Helen's former suitors were called on to join the expedition.

However, improvements are 
not being restricted to the cam

The Spirit of Skibo (SOS) suf
fered Saturdays showers to spon
sor a tailgate party, in hope of 
helping the Tartan football team 
to its 400th win. At first it seemed 
as if the downpour would wash 
away the vitality that had been 
brought back to life only a week 
ago, but the energetic group 
would have-none of 
that. SOS mem
bers posted fly
ers announc
ing that the 
tailgate 
party was 
still on and the 
club president,
Eric Borts, junior 
ECE major, stood 
on the corner of 
Morewood and 
Forbes with a . 
megaphone 
trying to at
tract partygoers. The oranization 
had origi
nally in
tended for the 
event to occur 
on the grassy 
dune that 
separates 
Morewood from 
Mudge, but the weather wouldnt 
permit it.
Inside, students trickled in and 
out of the Mudge lounge as the 
rain dribbled down. Sounds of 
the 80s and 90s squirted out of 
someones stereo. The fizz of soda 
(or pop if you prefer) sprayed and 
bulk quantities of candy, chips, 
and cookies were produced while 
the gathering waited for the hot 
logs to appear.
Meanwhile, outside, some of the 
most vigorous and inspired stu
dents on campus cajoled a fire to 
life in the misty drizzle. The flame 
flickered from many failed at
tempts before the charcoal was 
finally lit under an awkwardly 
erected tarp. Hot dogs and an 
onion-ketchup topping were soon 
arriving in waves to the eager 
students. The party in the lounge 
was confusing, but fun.
It wasnt certain if any abun
dance of people would brave the
their
^ upcoming 
concerts
throughout Pittsburgh. Lastly, 
Dr. Keeling has expressed his 
hope to develop formal alliances 
with art agencies ... and educa
tional institutions.
Dr. Keeling expressed that he 
is incredibly impressed with 
Carnegie Mellon and feels that 
he is fortunate to be involved 
with such an institution. He 
looks forward to the following 
years and hopes to remain ac
tive in the Pittsburgh commu
nity as well as the CMU com
munity.

at a home football game versus Notre Dame. Today the Kiltie Band 
still has the distinction of dressing in this traditional fare. On 
occasion, bagpipers have joined the band, but the two sounds do not 
mix well. However, bagpipers do appear throughout the year at 
ceremonies such as commencement.
One of the most anticipated of all CMU traditions is Spring 
Carnival. Carnival got its start as Campus Week, the schools 
earliest attempt at homecoming. After a few years the event was 
moved to the fall so as to include a football game and attract more 
alumni. Student protests followed and Carnival returned in a format 
similar to todays. Originally it included the Sweepstakes, a Scotch 
N Soda production, and two dances where a campus queen was 
crowned. Booth was added soon after to the weekends events.
Other traditions are less formal but still enjoyed by many 
students. Relaxing on Flagstaff, meeting by the Clock, or traying 
down Schenley probably will never appear in history books, but 
have great importance in the daily life of students. Architects 
leap is another long-standing CMU tradition. A stairwell in 
Wean Hall, eight stories high, has always been the traditional 
way of discarding of unwanted projects, benches, computer moni
tors, etc. A poem running down the side of the staircase says, 
When youre feeling like a jerk, cause your project just dont 
work, go ahead and take the leap, then youll finally get some 
sleep. For many students (especially architects), these are words 
to live by.
This is just a small sampling of the vast traditions at CMU. 
These traditions create a foundation for CMU history.

students watched football in 
the adjoining room, while oth
ers chatted or even danced. Oth
ers still participated in a large 
game of Twister. People crowded 
in to play on the Mudge first and 
second floor landing. Many old 
Twister mats had been taped to

spinner to be found. Two stu
dents quickly remedied the situ

which were very popular at the 
party.
They EmCeed the game, 
plucking the colored M&Ms from 
the cup and made appropriate 
shouts ofYellow, right hand! or 
Blue, left leg! before popping 
them into their mouths.
The crowd often swelled as 
people drifted in and out of the 
lounge. But the head count began 
to ebb as game-time drew near, 
as a steady stream of students 
seemed to leave all at once, pre
sumably to the game.
We hope to see another tail

The Pittsburgh Symphony Orches

concerts. On September 26-28, the or

Carnegie Mellon, and 1NwOtM9g 
ptN'du9hgc wvd Dkc also composed by 
Strauss. The orchestra and Ms. Koledo 
DeAlmeida performed a near-flawless 
concert in playing these three enjoy
able and spirited pieces.
The overture was composed by 
Gioachino Rossini, who owes his inter
national fame to this piece and an op
era, ngMhi'p9C He based it on Luigi 
Moscas score, which had already ac
companied Angelo Anellis libretto. 
onug090gMg 9M m0f'i9c which translates 
to The Italian Girl in Algiers, depicts 
Isabella, an Italian young woman, who 
tames Mustafa, the fearsome boy of 
Algiers. This piece demands a very 
energetic style, which the Pittsburgh 
Symphony Orchestra delivered. The 
orchestra performed with clear preci
sion and a broad range of dynamics.

A man comes into the ER displaying a

death doesnt make sense. Luthan de

finds out a bit more than he bargained

The characters had no depth, and no

Michael Palmers book of the same name) 
seems flat and unexciting. I looked at 
my watch more times than I care to
think about. An episode ofjAY has more 
drama, action, and thrills. Sure, this is a 
movie which brings up important mo

so boring in the process? The little bit of

more graphic (but not as well choreo

Hackman, once again playing the vil
lain, is soft, quiet, and not very threat
ening. Grant comes across as a stum
bling, confused Englishman. Sarah Jes
sica Parker has third billing in this film, 
but you wouldnt know that from watch
ing it. She only appears in a couple 
scenes, and those that she does appear 
in add very little to her already-hollow 
character. Michael Apted, who directed 
some great films such as 4ti900gd WM nO'

claustrophobic. But even 
with a fine director, you 
cannot save a film when 
the acting is weak and the 
script is shoddy.

enthusiasm among th Greeks. At 
Sigma Alpha Epsilon (SAE), the

shy at this party; they enforce a noclothes-under-togas rule.

Sometimes you have to break 
from tradition and strike out in 
your own direction, making the 
rules as you go. Other times, 
youre best off with the estab
lished rules, trying to do as best 
s you can in a field of many.
Although, Kristen Barrys debut 
nO' P'f9MM9Mfc uO' j9pp0'c uO' 
AMp is by no means a bad album, 
there really is not much that sets 
it apart from the wealth of other 
recording available. From the 
lyrical matter to the song struc
ture, nothing is new, but at least 
it is well done.
Kristen Barry 
The Beginning, the 
End 
Records
; Perhaps her biggest asset is 
her voice, which is similar to many 
others in the pop-alternative 
world of today. A poor singing 
voice can ruin an otherwise fine 
album, while a good one can save 
a mediocre record. For Kristen 
Barry, the latter is tine.
The album opens with 
Nothings Too Good, a song that 
sets the pace for the album, both 
lyrically and musically. Like most 
others on the album (and a great 
many today), the track deals with 
a bad relationship that leads her 
to state, My head feels like un
derwater / Im an air balloon /
Without a father / And I cried.
As you may already have guessed, 
there are no great revelations 
hiding in the language of the al
bum. The lyrics are accompanied 
by slow, rhythmic guitar and bass 
in a simple melody. The drums 
are light and only accentuate 
Barrys clear vocals.

Office of Admissions, the original Fence collapsed under its own 
weight. The current one is a concrete reconstruction of the original.
. The Fence now serves as a meeting ground for students and as a 
billboard for all sorts of student organizations, such as Greek 
parties. The Fence has also served as a prime location for students 
to hold Holocaust memorials and for such groups as the Womens 
Center to hold Take Back the Night vigils.
. Each week, devoted students can be seen camping out in front of 
the Fence, guarding their artwork to ensure that it lasts at least until 
morning. The rules for painting the Fence include the fact that it 
must be painted between midnight and 6 am. Also, it must be 
painted in its entirety, and only brushes may be used to paint it, so 
ivho ever wishes to paint it must be committed.
I In a university with such highly focused and intensive depart
ments where students find themselves with relatively little time for 
social activities, the Fence serves as a much-needed medium for 
students to express themselves, communicate new ideas, and adver
tise up-coming social events.
The Fence earned recognition in the Guinness Book of World 
Records as the most painted object in the world, before it collapsedin. 
It was replaced in 1993. The memory of the originalfence has stood 
the test of time and is a landmark on the CMU campus.
My Time, a blatant Tori Amos 
imitation complete with a 
change in vocal styles, and the 
last hidden track, which I se
verely hope was a joke with its 
high-pitched vocals over a coun
try background. The only other
iature story where the first tells track worth mentioning is God
of her disgust with a relationship 
and her desire to leave while the 
second presents the mans view. 
This is appropriate, since the sec
ond is actually a cover of a Neil 
Young track. These songs are also 
the first signs of diversity on the 
album, with the gradual opening 
of Gotta Go that sounds like a 
vibrating coil and the churning 
guitar, discordance, and forceful 
drums of Dont Cry. While not 
all of it works, it is nice to hear 
variation from her standard 
rhythmic vocals with rhythmic 
music.
Other high 
points of the al
bum include the 
fast paced, 
slightly crunchy 
guitar of Seeing 
Gun and the 
slight tinge of 
funk in Big 
Girl. The 
former is also set 
apart from the 
rest of the album 
by its lyrics 
which reflect an 
anti-war stance.
The latter has a 
guitar part that 
seems to swipe 
several notes of

While a good debut with its 
good and bad points, nO' P'f9MM9Mfc uO' j9pp0'c uO' AMp is an 
album that shows Barrys po
tential as yet to be realized.

Drama debuts on Web
By CHUCK FRYMAN
ngiugM UvM9ti 1ugeeyi9u'i
So, youre a fan of j'0itd' 
L0gh' and HIGFIc but you just 
dont seem to have enough 
drama in your life. Well now 
you can get your fill right on 
the World Wide Web with nO' 
Agdu r900gf'c a cyber-soap op
era that places its target right 
on Generation X.
The soap centers 
around 24-year-old 
editor, Eve 
Ramsey, a taste
fully neurotic in
habitant of 
Manhattans artsy 
East Village. Some 
of Eves acquain
tances include 
Duncan, a fashion
conscious Irish 
Casanova, Norm,
Eves power hun
gry boss, and 
Daphne, a hopeful 
actress looking for 
work. Eve and her 
friends have some 
pretty exciting ad
ventures including 
car accidents, 
heroin addictions, 
and Duke kidnap
ping just to name a 
few.
One aspect of nO' Agdu r90-
0gf' that makes it unique is its 
cliques. Each character has his 
or her own clique which users 
can join in order to receive email 
from that character about up
coming show themes and excit
ing gossip. I joined a clique 
myself  Joes to be exact  
and received email from my 
chosen character yesterday. He 
told me that he was planning
to visit Eve. I was honored. I 
decided on Joe by reading the 
character biographies which con
tain everything from a characters 
secret ambition to his or her fa
vorite color. Each episode con
tains text, audio, video, and 
around 60 photos of the charac
ters in action.
You also have the option of lis
tening to nO' Agdu r900gf' radio 
station as you browse the site,
East Village is the modern version of a soap opera.
which features bands hailing from 
the East Village. Marinex Multimedia corporation, the company 
behind the soap opera, has even 
released a compilation CD of 
music from these bands, which 
include Bite the Wax Godhead 
and Johnny Skilsaw.
The actual plots of the episodes 
are as funny as they are implau
sible. The most recent plot cen
tered around Norm and Eves best 
friend, Mick. It seems Mick told
Eve that he had HIV, when in 
fact he only pretended to have 
HIV so that Norm could pre
tend to cure him. After Micks 
fake HIV was fake-cured by 
Norm, Norm planned to become 
rich off of his healing powers. 
In return Norm promised to 
publish Micks book. Unfortu
nately Eve found out about the 
scheme and refused to speak to 
Mick ever again. Mick got de
pressed, walked 
around the city 
for a day, hailed 
a cab heading 
home, and died 
when the cabbie 
ran a stop sign. 
Thats right, the 
site was started 
in March and al
ready they are 
killing people off.
The far
fetched plots and 
two-dimen
sional charac
ters of nO' Agdu 
r900gf' combine 
to make some 
great entertain
ment, but be pre
pared for
heavier topics 
than an ordinary 
television soap 
opera. Pot, cigarettes, and other 
drugs arent necessarily con
demned in nO' Agdu r900gf'c 
yet its still the perfect diver
sion if youre spending the night 
in a cluster and are just tired of 
working.

see how the hip half lives, dial

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  30 September 1996L13
One of the best things about these collec
tions of unreleased songs is that you get to 
hear some great covers of other bands tunes.
One of the best is Everclears cover of 
Morrisseys How Soon is Now. Ive never 
been a Morrissey fan, but this song flat-out 
rocks. Everclear took the whiny quality out 
of the song and gave it a nice little kick in the 
pants, sharpening the edges and making this 
one worth hearing.
Another great tune is Mary Lou Lords cover 
of Weens Birthday Boy. I havent heard the 
original song, though this one doesnt seem to 
be the typical Ween song, at least the way 
Mary Lou Lord does it. Hers is a very pas- Ug66'i:gy is a com 
sionate and touching rendition of this song, 
quietly charged and subdued, which works very well.
Finally, there is one last cover on this disc worth mentioning. 
Low does an awesome (and gnarly, dude) rendition of I Started 
a Joke, an old tune from 1972. Again, like Lords song, this one 
is very emotionally charged and yet subdued. Some testosterone 
junkies may not like it because of this, and they may call it a 
wussie song, but you and I know otherwise (at least I do, maybe 
you dont care). It is a slow song, and the singer does have a 
slightly high-pitched voice, but the song is just too cool, espe
cially because of these last qualities.
The bulk of th album is filled with original songs, and these 
being previously unreleased make a much more mixed group 
than the covers. There are quite a few good songs here, more good 
than bad thankfully, but there are also some crappy ones.
One of the best of these is Man.. .or Astroman?s Earth Station 
Radio. If you like the brand of music played by Man...or 
Astroman? (i.e., crazy spaced-out surf-style stuff) you will, of 
course, like this song. Like most of their songs, there are no 
lyrics, just great music and a couple quotes from B-movies. And 
like the end of the song says, They sure didnt get this stuff at 
Radio Shack.
Other good stuff on this album are the Hi-Fives Skybolt X-66, 
a cool little surf tune, Redd Krosss Star Lust, which sounds like 
something STP could have put on its new album, and the 
Cocktailss weird lounge instrumental Gripper Bite.
But, like I said, there are the songs that were previously unreleased 
for a reason. Like Fitz of Depressions incomprehensible punk drivel 
Burn it Down, and Godheadsilos obnoxiously bad Heaven isnt 
Hollywood. There are also a couple of other pretty standard college
xayo Mammom Kecoros 
pilation of various artists that have played Jabberjaw, the club.
rock songs that go unnoticed among the other songs.
Overall, this a good album with a few really good standout songs. Itfs 
also a pretty good sampler of various college-type rock music, with 
many bands you may not have heard before. I recommend anyone who 
may be feeling a little adventurous to check this disc out.

I hate surprises. Im not spon
taneous andl fear the unexpected. 
You could call me a control freak. 
o'g3' Wu nt BOgMh' from Homage 
Comics was one of the few sur
prises that I actually enjoyed. 
When picking up my weekly com
ics, the colorful, cartoon-like cover 
drew my attention. After flipping 
through the book, I noticed it was 
written by James Robinson with 
art by Paul Smith, the team from 
DCs 4t0p'M mf'c so it was then a 
definite buy.
Being busy getting adjusted to 
school again, Ive been out of touch 
with the comic book industry, so I 
knew nothing about this book, oth
erwise I would have already had a 
copy reserved. It is exactly the 
type of book the industry needs 
one with quality art, an original, 
whimsical fantasy story, and a fe
male main character. Although I 
love most of the stuff Vertigo puts 
out, I think the industry is in a glut 
of dark fantasy books, much like 
the vigilante, bad girl, and funny 
animal gluts that have also 
plagued the comic shelves.
Paul Smiths cover art is what 
drew me to o'g3' Wu nt BOgMh'c
and his interior art is just as 
compelling. There are few artists 
that can switch from bright, ener
getic panels to somber, shadowy 
pages so smoothly. At one point we 
have Chance frolicking with a pixie 
in a meadow and on the opposite 
page we see John Raven fleeing 
over dark rooftops. Smith is a com
bination of Alan Davis and Mike 
Mignola, two of my favorite art
ists.
Robinson is one of the premier 
writers working today. His 
1ugiNgM is one of the most inno
vative revamps of a character since 
Neil Gaiman got a hold of Sand
man. In o'g3' 9u nt BOgMh'c 
Robinson takes us to a world much 
like ours, except that magic is real. 
The main character, Chance is the 
teenage daughter of Lucas Fal
coner, an occult investigator. 
Robinson must be commended for 
(pardon the pun) taking a chance 
on having a female lead. Recently 
female leads have been in vogue, s 
like Shi and Vampirella, whose 
skimpy costumes barely conceal 
their anatomically impossible 
breasts. Robinson, on the other 
hand, created a realistic teen
age girl striving to fill a role not 
intended for women. Comics 
need more characters like this, 
rather than carbon copy pin
ups. Robinson states in his clos
ing comments, JSo'g3' Wu nt 
BOgMh' may] perhaps even woo 
a few [women] back to the me
dium that tends to alienate the 
majority of them.
o'g3' Wu ut BOgMh' is a won
derful break from, the glut of 
dark comics littering the stands
 1996 Aegis Entertainment, Inc. 
o'g3' Wu nt BOgMh' stars a realistic, teenage heroine.
today. Homage Comics must be 
applauded for publishing a book 
like BOgMh', one that would 
usually be a small-press book 
that many readers would miss. 
Buy this book for your sister.

Delicatessen
A delicatessen is a French place where many 
things are available. You can buy buns and meat 
and vegetables. Dont forget, a delicatessen is 
better than a deli. Delis are owned and operated by 
weird people who might be aliens.
With that in mind, lets discuss the movie. Di
rected by Jean-Pierre Jeunet (French) and Marc 
Caro (French), this movie is about a person who 
owns a delicatessen who puts strange and inter
esting things into his cold cuts. The movie was 
wonderful. It was funny and interesting and very 
well done. And it was French, which ups the ante 
at least 30 to 40 percent.
El Perro del Falafel sez: Mmmmm ... cannibal
ism.

The City of Lost Children
This one was directed by the same people who 
directed Delicatessen. Its pretty moody and kind 
of disjointed but beautifully rendered. While there 
are no meat products in the movie, the climactic 
scene does include a shot of a slice of veal.
Again, this one is French. Its about a guy who 
steals childrens brains. See, this guy Crank cant 
dream. So what he does is to take all these little 
kids dreams but since hes scary, all he scores are 
their nightmares. So Crank bops on over to the 
City of Lost Children (or, in French, El Camino Sobroso) where he and this big lumberjack steal 
all the children. But all the good guys (a strong
man, deep-sea divers, and cyclops people without 
eyes) come to the rescue to save the children. This 
one features stunning and powerful visuals. See it 
with El Perro del Falafel, who may pee on you.

Eraser
Uh oh. This one stars Arrrrrrrrrnold 
Schwarzenegger, which is a pretty big deal if 
youre 15 and in love. Friday, Im in love. Saturday 
is gray.
See, Arrrrrrrrrrrrnold is a guy who erases 
people for the FBI. So this woman, Vanessa Will
iams, gets all wrapped up in a messy deal that 
features a big deal kind of spy ring. So 
Arrrrrrrrrrrnold bops off people and runs around 
with Williams in tow, which improves your breath
ing and circulates your chi.

Peeping Tom
So you remember that one movie called 
Manhunter, in which the evil guy killed people by 
looking at their pictures? (If you dont, dont worry 
about it; but all those in the category I mentioned, 
pat yourselves on the back. Youre in an exclusive 
club.)
So this one is about a guy who takes pictures of 
people before he kills them. Pretty scary. It was a 
big deal in the 60s, and now its a real kult klassic. 
Anyway, Im going to review another movie, too, 
just to keep you posted.Sapphire is a 1959 movie featuring a series of 
French people who find out that a murdered music 
student was actually passing himself off as a white 
person. Its fairly striking, even today, and a real 
find.
