CMU hosts womens seminar
By AMITKAR
Tartan Contributing Editor
Carnegie Mellons first annual confer
ence on women, Mosaic, was held on 
Sunday under the auspices of the Office 
of Student Life. Attracting over 150 at
tendees and 25 guest speakers, the day
long event marked the first time CMU 
community has formally organized to 
discuss womens issues.
The impetus for Sundays event was 
provided in a large part by Kerri Ullucci, 
senior in H&SS, a sexual assault intern 
with the Office of Student Life, and 
conference chair.
I have been working for Student Life 
for over three years now and Ive been at 
other conferences in other cities and 
found a great deal of information that 
just wasnt available here, she said. 
But I also noticed a real sense of com
munity at these conferences  some
thing we lack here at CMU. I wanted to 
bring that here.
Ulluccis vision started to become real
ity last September when she presented a 
proposal to various university adminis
trative bodies with the aim of garnering 
financial and organizational support. I 
was just blown away by the support

people were willing to give, Ullucci said. 
Within three weeks, we had enough 
money to pull off a decent program ... 
[The conference] was something that a 
lot of people here wanted to see for a long 
time  the roadblocks were minimal. 
The level of administrative interest in 
Mosaic was affirmed by the fact that
every undergraduate department but 
one, as well as the Heinz School, stood 
alongside Student Affairs, Student Life, 
and the Presidents Office in support
ing the conference.

A cut above the rest...U.S. News ranks 
graduate programs
BY ENA KHAN
Tartan News Editor
The latest graduate school rankings 
published by U.S. News and World 
Report rated CMUs Masters of Fine 
Arts program and the drama program 
sixth in the nation, making a signifi
cant leap from 20th place in 1996. The 
engineering college came in eighth, 
two notches down from last year, and 
the Graduate School of Industrial 
Administration (GSIA) remained 
14th overall.
I think engineering and art and 
drama and the business school have a 
lot to be proud of. I think beyond the 
recognition that we feel good about 
[the rankings]. When youre small and 
youre ranked highly, thats excep
tional, said Provost Paul Christiano.
The engineering rankings evaluate 
institutions based on student selectiv
ity, faculty resources, research activ
ity, and reputation. Overall rank is de
termined by taking the highest scores in 
each category. CMU received 95.8 points 
out of 100, coming in behind schools 
such as Stanford and the Georgia Insti
tute of Technology. CMUs engineering 
program received high scores in the stu
dent selectivity, research activity, and 
reputation categories.
Out of the 219 schools ranked, CIT 
was recognized in the top 10. John Ander
son, dean of CIT, said, CIT... [is in] the 
top five percent of all [engineering pro
grams] . We in CIT are very pleased to be 
included in this group because it reflects 
that CIT is respected for its engineering 
program, nationwide...
In the departmental rankings, electri
cal and computer engineering (ECE) was 
ranked third, behind Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology (MIT) and Uni

Srees Foods, one of the two vendors 
serving Indian food at CMU was de
nied vendor status by Dining Services 
and was permanently removed from 
the campus due to physical and verbalattacks to a CMU employee.
Although problems between Srees 
Food and the University previously ex
isted, the straw that broke the camels 
back was an argument between
Sreevardhan and Manager of Opera
tions for Dining Services, Frank Fulmer. 
After noticing that a sign intended to 
direct traffic between the Credit Union 
and the vendors in the basement was 
missing, Fulmer replaced it in its origi
nal spot despite the wishes of 
Sreevardhan.
It literally [blocked] the view down 
the hall. Customers were hitting their 
shoulders on it because the hallway is so 
narrow, he said. Sreevardhan also said 
that the sign gave customers easier ac
cess to Taste of India, another vendor 
specializing in Indian food, also located
in the basement of Building-D.
We were losing customers [to Taste of 
India], said Sreevardhan.
The difference of opinion lead to vio
lent reactions, according to Fulmer and 
Sreevardhan. He... came running from 
behind the counter and picked up the 
sign and threw it, said Fulmer. Its a 
stainless steel sign with a heavy base.
Fulmer said Sreevardhan almost hit 
his face with the sign, missing him by six 
inches.
Sreevardhan said that he lost his 
cool because of Fulmers lack of profesPlease see VENDOR, page 5
LA gala raises funds for Purnell
By GIL ALTEROWITZ
Tartan Senior Staffwriter
Various celebrities, CMU faculty, and 
others crowded into Beverly Hillss 
Hilton Hotel for An Evening for the 
Purnell Center for the Arts this past 
Tuesday. The events goal was to raise 
$500,000, with proceeds funding the con
struction of the new Purnell Center. The 
goal, exceeded by 50 percent, amounted 
to $750,000, making the event the larg
est fund-raiser sponsored by CMU?
We exceeded our projected dollar goal 
for the project, which I think speaks for 
itself. I think thats success there, said 
Jay Carson, director of Development for
Arts and Humanities and the CMU con
tact/coordinator for the project, Butthe 
other [benefit] is... we reaped a number 
of public relations and cultivational ben
efits with our alumni and with the pay 
dividends  I am certain  in years to 
come.
CMU alumnus Bud Yorkin, producer 
of several popular television shows in
cluding All in the Family, Maude, Good 
Times, and Sanford and Son, hosted the 
event.According to Yorkin, over 800 
people attended the event. He said, Is 
that successful? ... beyond anybodys 
expectations.
The evening featured a VIP cocktail 
party along with a dinner and stage
show. According to Don Hale,vice presi
dent of university relations, many audi
ence members were drama alumni. In 
fact, several of these alumni were hon
ored at the event for their contributions 
to the arts, namely Yorkin, Oscar win
ner Holly Hunter (Arts 80), and execu
tive producer of the television hit ER 
John Wells (Arts 79). President 
Mehrabian was also honored at the event.
I think hes [President Mehrabian 
has] done such an incredible job and 
before he leaves the university he should 
be the one to break ground for this 
building. Groundbreaking for the build
ing is expected this spring, said Yorkin

Cloning debate starts 
with bans, warnings
CLINTON BARS FEDERAL RE
SEARCH ON HUMAN CLONING
WASHINGTON, March 4 (AP)  
Declaring the creation of life a miracle 
that reaches beyond laboratory sci
ence, President Clinton on Tuesday 
barred spending federal money on 
human cloning. He also urged a halt in 
private research until the ethical im
pact is better understood.
Clinton, warning against trying to 
play God, directed all federal agen
cies not to allocate money for cloning 
of human beings although he acknowl
edged Tuesday that the government is 
not now funding such research.
Clinton also asked private research
ers to voluntarily hold off at least until 
the National Bioethics Advisory Com
mission can study the matter, a move 
with which biological and medical re
searchers agreed.
CHIEF RABBI BANS HUMAN 
CLONING VIA SPOKESMAN
JERUSALEM, March 6 (AP)  
Israels chief rabbi has said genetic 
cloning of human beings would be a 
deviation from the role of science 
and forbidden by Jewish law, a spokes
man said Thursday.
Rabbi Yisrael Lau said that the 
Torah permits the doctor to heal, but 
not to encroach upon the role of the 
creator  not to create life by unnatu
ral means, his spokesman Daniel Aviv 
told The Associated Press.
Lau said that in-vitro fertilization is 
permissible because it can be viewed 
as healing, since it helps to cure bar
renness caused by complications in 
pregnancy and birth.
Cloning, however, does not consti
tute healing, Lau said, according to 
Aviv. It is a total deviation from the
role of science. We have a duty to 
improve the quality of life and to ex
tend it, but nothing more than that.
POPE DENOUNCES DANGER
OUS EXPERIMENTS ON LIFE
VATICAN CITY, March 2 (AP)A 
few days after the Vatican called for a 
ban on cloning humans, Pope John 
Paul II denounced dangerous experi
ments that harm human dignity.
The pope did not mention specifi
cally the news last month that re
searchers in Scotland had cloned a 
sheep, or the cloned Oregon monkeys.
On Wednesday, however, the 
Vatican newspaper urged govern
ments to quickly pass laws banning 
the cloning of humans because 
people have the right to be born in 
a human way.
FRENCH OFFICIAL CALLS FOR 
BAN ON HUMAN CLONING
PARIS, March 3 (AP)Alarmed at 
the recent cloning of animals in Brit
ain and the United States, Frances 
research minister on Monday called 
for a total ban on human cloning.
Francois dAubert, secretary of state 
for research, told RTL radio he was 
shocked by what he called lax regu
lations on cloning in the United States 
and elsewhere. He also said the French 
parliament should consider banning 
human cloning after the National Eth
ics Committee issues a report.
Despite international efforts to 
reach an agreement on bioethics, 
DAubert felt it impossible to have 
global ethics on the subject because 
there are people who will never think 
like the Europeans or the French. He 
also cautioned the scientific commu
nity against going too far.

WORCESTER, Mass., March 5 (AP)
 Microsoft Corp. has Worcester Poly
technic Institute engineering student 
Paul Greene to thank for finding a secu
rity flaw in the software giants popular 
Internet Explorer program.
The flaw could allow a Web site opera
tor to secretly run programs or destroy 
files on someone elses personal computer.
Microsofts programmers scrambled to 
fix the bug in the companys key Internet 
product, which is used by millions ofpeople 
worldwide to access the Web.
It started with an assignment to dem
onstrate how scientific techniques can be 
used in marketing. The students were 
told to develop a survey assessing the 
effectiveness of the schools freshman ori
entation program.
While trying to share files with three 
other students, Greene mistakenly cre
ated a shortcut, a device used to start 
other programs. Then I got to wonder
ing what would happen if I tried it, he 
said. And suddenly he found he was able 
to run programs on the other computers.
I called over my roommates  com
puter science majors Brian Morin, 22, of 
Nashua, N.H., and Geoffrey Elliott, 20, 
of Brattleboro, Vt.  and their mouths 
just dropped open, Greene said.
At first we thought this is real neat 
stuff, he said. Then the implications 
set in, and we realized that you could 
rain absolute terror on someones ma
chine with the program.
Last Thursday, the trio posted an 
email note on Microsofts bulletin 
board dealing with program bugs. 
When they didnt get an immediate 
response, they messaged several on
line magazines.
By Sunday night, they still hadnt 
been able to rouse any interest in their 
discovery, so they posted their infor
mation on a public Internet bulletin 
board along with some harmless pro
grams developed by Morin and Elliott 
to demonstrate the flaw.
Weve been bombarded ever since, 
said Morin, a senior who runs a soft
ware-consulting company with three 
offices as well as being a full-time 
student at Worcester.
Top pick for CIA 
to feel the heat
WASHINGTON, March 6 (AP)  CIA 
Director-designate Anthony Lake got a 
preview of what may lie in store for him 
next week as a key Senator laid out a 
raft of concerns about President Clintons 
nominee for the job of top spy.
Senator Richard Shelby, R-Ala., chair
man of the Senate Intelligence Commit
tee, said in a Senate floor speech Wednes
day that Lakes written answers to com
mittee queries were inadequate and left 
open a number of issues for Lakes con
firmation hearing next Tuesday.
The committee investigation is focus
ing on personal stock transactions, U.S. 
foreign policy on China, and the bur
geoning campaign financing issue.
For a committee chairman to speak 
on the Senate floor about a nominee 
before a confirmation hearing is highly 
unusual, and indicates the degree to 
which Lake, who owns a farm in 
Worthington, Mass., has become a 
political lightning rod.
This leader must be worthy of the 
confidence of the president, the Con
gress and, yes, the American people, 
Shelby said. Major concerns, he said, 
revolve around Lakes ability to make 
the transition from a White House in
sider to a political provider of intelli
gence information.
At least two Republicans on the com
mittee have said they plan to support 
Lake, makingit almost certain the nomi
nation will go to the Senate floor with a 
favorable recommendation.
Taiwan prevents 
talks, says China
BEIJING, March 7 (AP)  Taiwans 
refusal to acknowledge that it is a prov
ince of China is preventing high-level 
talks between the governments in Taipei 
and Beijing, the Chinese foreign minis
ter said Friday.
China has insisted that talks with 
Taiwan can proceed only if they take 
place with the explicit understanding 
that there is only one China and that 
Taiwan is a part of it.
Taiwans refusal to accept the so-called 
one-China principle has hindered 
progress in improving links across the 
Taiwan Strait, Qian Qichen said during 
a news conference.
Taiwan is governed by the National
ists who fled to the island after losing 
the mainland to the Chinese commu
nists in 1949. China considers it a 
renegade province to be retaken by 
force if necessary.
Lawyer accuses 
newspaper of theft
DENVER, March 4 (AP) Timothy 
McVeighs lawyer demanded an investi
gation Monday of The Dallas Morning 
News, accusing the newspaper of steal
ing hundreds of files from his computer, 
including a purported confession from 
the Oklahoma City bombing defendant.
Stephen Jones, while denying that the 
statement was in fact a confession, said: 
There is no justification whatever for
this criminal act.
Morning News lawyer Paul Watler 
said the newspaper met the highest 
ethical standards.
We did not break any laws, he 
said. We have no fear of criminal 
repercussions.
Later, McVeighs defense team issued 
a statement saying the confession was 
faked to persuade a witness suspected of 
being involved in the bombing conspiracy 
to talk to defense investigators.
The defense believed that this person 
was willing to talk if the individual be
lieved that he was not suspected by the 
defense of being a participant in the 
bombing, the defense said.
On Friday, Jones had said he thought 
the purported confession from McVeigh 
published by the Morning News was a 
hoax perpetrated by someone trying to 
set this newspaper up.
Monday, he accused the newspaper 
of breaking into the defenses com
puter files to obtain hundreds of docu
ments for McVeigh and co-defendant 
Terry Nichols, as well as 25,000 FBI 
files. Jones offered no proof that theft 
was committed.
Nations hospitals 
cause pollution
WASHINGTON, March 6 (AP)  A 
coalition of environmental organizations 
said today that waste incinerators at the 
nations hospitals are a main source of 
cancer-causing dioxin and other dan
gerous pollutants.
A report issued by the group criticizes 
the Clinton administration for propos
ing new regulations for hospital waste 
incineration that will do next to nothing 
to halt emissions of dioxin, mercury, and 
other pollutants into the environment. 
It also says the hospital industrys 
main trade organization, the American 
Hospital Association, has lobbied to 
weaken pending air pollution rules from 
the Environmental Protection Agency 
for, medical waste;incinerators.
According to the AHA, about 2,300 of 
the nations 5,000 hospitals have on-site 
incinerators. The trade group said it 
would like to see less restrictive cleanair regulations for some small, rural, 
cash-strapped hospitals, but denies any 
effort to reduce standards overall.
The study estimated that Americas 
hospitals generate about two million tons 
of waste each year. Much of that Waste is 
polyvinyl chloride plastic, which when 
burned produces dioxin. The incinera
tors also spew mercury, cadmium, and 
other pollutants, the report said.
The environmentalists found that 69 
percent of the incinerators have no pol
lution control devices and account for 56 
percent of the total incinerator capacity.
GOP presses for 
non-political probe
WASHINGTON, March 5 (AP)Sen
ate Republicans are stepping up pres
sure for an independent counsel to in
vestigate Democratic fundraising, while 
President Clinton said Wednesday that 
the issue shouldnt be a political one. 
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott pro
posed a non-binding resolution calling on
Attorney General Janet Reno to seek ap
pointment of an independent counsel to 
investigate possible criminal wrongdoing 
by Democratic Party fund-raisers and 
Clintons re-election campaign.
Faced with opposition from his own 
Republican Party to expanding the 
Senates fund-raising probe into con
gressional races, Lott said: The scope 
should be limited to illegal activities in 
the presidential campaigns last year 
and other related practices by the two 
major political parties.
The system isnt broken, the laws 
have been broken, he told reporters.
Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle 
said Wednesday that Democrats would 
insist that the Senate investigation ex
amine fund raising by congressional as 
well as the presidential candidates. 
We will not compromise on scope, 
said Daschle, who has previously 
threatened to use a prolonged debate 
tactic to block Republican plans for 
the investigations budget.
Senator Orrin Hatch, chairman of the 
Senate Judiciary Committee, said he 
would ask the panels Republican mem
bers to sign a letter formally requesting 
Reno to appoint an independent counsel 
to investigate high-office holders.
Under the independent counsel law, 
Reno would have 30 days to respond to 
the request. I doubt that shell refuse,1 
Hatch said.
Clinton pushes 
for welfare hiring
WASHINGTON, March 8 (AP) 
President Clinton, in sync with his push 
for private businesses and churches to 
hire off welfare rolls, ordered federal 
agencies to do the same.
He gave them 30 days to find a way. 
The president, who defused welfare 
as an issue in his re-election by enact
ing a GOP-sponsored five-year cutoff 
of benefits, has pledged to soften the 
laws blow.
He has aggressively pushed the pri 
vate sector, nonprofit groups, and 
churches to find room on their pay
rolls for people trying to get off the 
dole. His goal: to find jobs for 2 million 
welfare recipients over the next four 
years. Vice President A1 Gore is to 
oversee the effort.
Government can help to move people 
from welfare to work by acting the way 
we want all employers to actdemand
ing high performance from workers but 
also going the extra mile to offer oppor
tunity to those who have been on welfare 
but want to do something more with 
their lives, the president said.
For at least two months, administra
tion officials have looked for ways, within 
a tangle of federal hiring rules and civilservice procedures, to move welfare re
cipients quickly into jobs in government, 
even in the White House.
The initiative came as many church 
leaders began questioning openly their 
capacity for welfare hires and suggest
ing that government was abdicating its 
responsibilities by foisting the welfare 
headache onto charities.
With 1.9 million people on the payroll 
and 58,000 hired last year alone, the 
federal government is the nations larg
est employer.

Carnegie Almanac
From National Weather Sen/ice bulletins and other sources
50 YEARS AGO, March 11, 
1947  Carnegie Mellon mour
ned the loss ofMildredE. Lawton, 
curator of the music department. 
Lawton died on March 1, 1947, 
after a year-long illness. Despite 
this long illness, however, Lawton 
remained at her position until 
two days before her death. Lawton 
joined the school staff in 1916 
and served as a mentor to many 
generations of Carnegie Mellon 
music students.
25 YEARS AGO, March 14, 
1972  On February 24, twelve 
workers at The Original Hot Dog 
Shop walked off their jobs in a 
strike. After unsuccessfully at
tempting to resolve grievances 
with Sid Simon, owner of the 
Oakland shop, the workers set 
up a picket to strike for unioniza
tion, which lasted for more than 
two weeks.
Workers complained that they 
were permitted no breaks, al
though working shifts were up to 
13 hours long, and that Simons 
hiring practices discriminated 
against blacks and women.
The majority of The Originals 
workers were students from the 
Pittsburgh area.
TEN YEARS AGO, March 10, 
1987The Carnegie Mellon Stu
dent Senate froze funding for The 
Student Union on the grounds that 
The Student Union had commit
ted copyright infringement against 
The New York Times by reprinting 
an article on the Anti-Ballistic 
Missiles Treaty without permis
sion. The motion, proposed by 
Senator David Levy, passed 13 - 8.
Despite arguments to table the 
vote until Student Union mem
bers could be present to defend 
their position, Senator Levy cited
three other instances of copyright 
infringement by The Student 
Union and argued that funding 
should be suspended to prevent 
further infractions.
FIVE YEARS AGO, March 9, 
1992According to two Carnegie 
Mellon students and several Uni
versity of Pittsburgh students, 
an Oakland couple who leases 
hundreds of apartments in the 
area was falsely charging stu
dents for damages. According to 
Karen Freeman, a Pitt student, 
apartment owner Calliope 
Kavalieratos charged her for pre
existing damages and for repairs 
that were never made.
A CMU student who wished to 
remain anonymous stated that 
students had been charged be
tween $2,000 and $3,000 for un
made repairs and sky-high clean
ing services.
ONE YEAR AGO, March 11, 
1996  On February 29, three Pi 
Lambda Phi alumni were con
victed of furnishing alcohol to a 
minor and consequently faced 
maximum sentences of one year 
in prison. The convictions fol
lowed the 1994 death of Justin 
Chambers, a fellow PiLam 
brother. Chambers died of alco
hol poisoning on December 10, 
1994 after attending a PiLam 
Christmas party. His blood alco
hol content was 0.54 when he 
died, more than five times the 
legal limit in Pennsylvania.
The convictions of William 
Halpin, Stephen Marting, and 
Thomas Hummel were seen as 
justified by Campus Security 
Chief James LaPaglia.

with ceiling-mounted speakers. 
The piano will be purchased this

is rusting, some of it dangerous to 
use, and, in the case of some of 
the dumbbells, even missing. 
In addition, the Athletic De
partment pledged to paint the 
walls and refurbish the floor
ing. The proposal passed with
out any opposition.
Account so that it could be used 
toward a larger project such as a 
new Scotland Yard or a smoking 
lounge in the soon-to-be-vacant 
Morewood basement. Krug replied 
that the Allocations committee 
weighed these suggestions and de
cided these projects would be too 
expensive evenifthe entire $80,000
were applied to them. They [the 
larger projects] werent possible this 
year, in my opinion, although each 
one of them have a slim possibility 
for next year. Another problem 
was that each one of those 
projects all had residual costs 
associated with them, and we 
didnt want that to happen ei
ther, Krug said afterward.
The McConomy Auditorium 
project consists of the addition of a 
new 35 millimeter projector, like in 
real movie theatres, and also the 
upgrade of the existing sound sys
tem to a Dolby Digital (AC3) sys
tem. To finish the sound system, 
digital wiring will have to be run to 
the existing speakers, and an am
plifier and digital decoder will have 
to be purchased. The total cost of 
the project will be around $65,000. 
It will be funded in part by Student 
Senate and by $25,000in donations
and pledges collected by Michael 
Murphy, dean of Student Affairs. 
Murphy agreed to raise the money 
on the condition that SDC Films 
and AB to keep the cost of admis
sion at $1. The rest of the costs 
will be split between AB andSDfc. 
The two organizations will take 
out interest-free loans with the 
university to cover these costs.
When [Murphy] offered to raise 
money within the administration 
to support this project on the 
promise that prices stay $1, that 
was what really got the ball roll
ing for the proposal. His support 
means a great deal to this project 
and we are glad to have it. And of 
course, we are glad to be able to 
keep the movies at $1 because it 
makes our events an even better 
deal for students on campus, said 
Brendan Dunham, 35mm Project 
Coordinator.
CMU sponsors first 
womens conference
MOSAIC, from page 1
ning Committee, was equally enthusi
astic about CMITs response to Mosaic. 
I know its been Kerris vision for some 
time now, she said. And there was 
actually a really good response from 
the campus, and a lot of support. Park 
said the level of response served to 
substantiate the organizers opinion 
that there was little discussion of 
womens issues at CMU. I dont think 
[discussions of womens issues] were 
at the level they should be  thats 
part of the reason [Mosaic] happened, 
she said.
The day-long event was organized 
into three sessions of various work
shops and seminars, broken up by 
lunch and a panel discussion, both 
held in Rangos Hall. The seminars, 
ranging in topics from womens spiri
tuality to sexual harassment, were led 
by administrators and faculty mem
bers who had volunteered their ser
vices.
In addition to securingthe involve
ment of notable members of the cam
pus community, the organizers were 
able to bring Nancy Hawley, a mem
ber of the Boston Womens Health 
Collective which publishes Our Bod
ies Ourselves. Hawley, w'ho was one 
of 50,000 women who attended the 
Beijing Womens Conference in 1995, 
focused on the issue of Body Image 
and led the 150-strong audience in 
an appraisal of physical self-percep
tion.
In Ulluccis estimation, about 30 of 
the roughly 170 people who attended 
the conference were men. I was very, 
very happy, she said. It doesnt 
matter how much women work, if 
the men arent listening we wont be 
able to do anything about these is
sues. The men who go are probably
the ones who need to go the least. 
But hopefully theyll tell their 
friends, and theyll tell their friends 
and thats how we educate people.
We definitely want to encourage 
men to participate... its necessary 
for men and women to work together 
for there to be equality, said Park.
It was a great turnout for a new 
program  especially for a womens 
program at Carnegie Mellon^ said 
Ullucci. I think the level of partici
pation on the part of the attendees 
was just awesome.
However, the organizers have iden
tified a small number of things they 
would like to see handled differently 
in subsequent conferences. Id like 
to see a little more variety in terms 
of issues discussed  Id like to fo
cus on issues that arent very Well 
covered [by other conferences or me
dia]/ said Ullucci. Citing the innate 
difficulty of getting- CMU students 
to commit an entire day to one, nonacademic activity, Park said, I 
would like to figure out how to keep 
people for the duration of the confer
ence, or at least get the same amount 
of information out in a shorter span 
of time.
We definitely want to have a con
ference every year  until theres 
no need for it, said Park. Which 
will probably be a long time.
Having seen her vision come to 
fruition in her last year at CMU, 
Ulluccis hope now is that the effects 
of Mosaic will be positive and longlasting.
1 would like to see people who 
attended keep this with them; to 
think about how the conference af
fected them and to keep that with 
them, she said. To do something 
that puts it all into action.
Amnesty activity scares officials
AMNESTY, from page 1
ation through several posters through
out campus, and the administration, 
who tore the posters down.
Warner Hall, not knowing it was a 
demonstration by Amnesty Interna
tional, became concerned about the wel
fare of Nair and considered taking 
disclipinary action against students in
volved. After realizing Amnesty Inter
national had staged the event with Nairs 
consent, who spent her time in captiv
ity eating lunch at Gulliftys, any pos
sible threats for disciplinary actions 
against the students were dropped.
I had 10 faculty members calling my 
office asking what was going on, said 
Barbara Lazarus, associate provost for 
academic affairs. I was afraid people 
might call the police. I understand [Am
nesty International] wanted noise, but 
we dont want the FBI over here search
ing for [Nair].
This reaction was absolutely out of 
the blue, said Nair. CMU is always so 
apathetic, I didnt think anyone would 
know. I thought I would humor [Am
nesty International] and things would 
go back to normal.
With this, the Warner Hall phone tag 
began. Lazarus phoned, among others, 
Paul Fowler, associate dean of Student 
Affairs, who phoned Campus Police, who 
brought him through to La Paglia, chief 
of Campus Police, who finally put all 
minds at ease.
We knew what [Amnesty Interna
tional] was doing before it happened, 
said Joe Bemanding, Campus Police 
officer. We were asked to keep an eye 
out so that nobody will get hurt.
While chaos went on within Warner 
Hall, threats of expulsion were being 
handed out to the Amnesty Interna
tional members.
There were alot of angry students 
yelling at us screaming Where did you 
take Indira? Some of the members were 
even threatened to get expelled, said 
Melissa Chan, sophomore chemical en
gineering major and 
member of Amnesty 
International. Though 
the original plan was 
to treat the situation 
as real as possible 
and remain secretive 
concerning the where 
abouts of Nair, the 
threats to the members 
changed that. Mem
bers told students and 
faculty members that 
Nair was fine, that the 
situation was a hoax, 
and that she would be 
present at the press 
conference that day.
In retrospect, the 
concern for those who 
called Dr. Barbara 
Lazarus and the EPP 
office makes me think 
that I should have 
warned Barbara 
Lazarus, and perhaps 
the Dean of Student 
Affairs that this was 
going to happen. But, I underestimated 
peoples concern. I have seen more seri
ous things go with little reaction and 
thought that this wouldnt cause any 
official confusion. wrote Nair in a letter 
to her students.
The students in Nairs class who wit
nessed the kidnapping seemed to have 
the strongest opinions because they saw 
what it was like to have someone taken 
away for no apparent reason.
We are so removed from these types 
of events in what we experience in the 
U.S. that it was a hard event to swal
low, said Michelle Vollmar, senior cre
ative writing major who witnessed Nairs 
kidnapping. Our class had a sense that 
things had to be okay because these 
situations cant happen here.
Even though Nair decided to go along 
with the kidnapping partly to humor 
the members, she did have political reaAndrew McDermott/Tartan Contributing Editor

sons, and a personal experience to add. 
As a graduate student at CMU, Nair 
befriended a man from Uganda who 
lived without political freedom for years, 
as Ugandas government turned to
wards communism. With every letter 
he wrote, explaining his discontent of 
living in such a society, she feared his 
safety since the government read each 
letter going in and out of the country.
Freedom, especially in this country, 
is taken for granted, said Nair. We 
dont realize that there is a fraction of 
the world that does not have freedom. 
The best we can do is keep writing 
letters to let them know that people are 
watching [the governments with politi
cal prisoners]. Hopefully, people will 
take steps to do something. No country 
wants to be caught with a bad thing, 
said Marshall Warfield, member of 
Amnesty International.

Fundraiser recognizes CMU alumni
PURNELL, from page 1
in a press release.
Regarding the attendance of 
many non-CMU individuals at 
the event, Carson said, What we 
decided we wanted to do was to 
widen our circle by including 
these non-CMU people who could 
really help us in a number of 
different ways. One was their gift 
to this particular event, but other 
way would be their awareness 
that Carnegie Mellon ... [has] 
one of the top drama schools in 
the country.
The video guy I worked with 
on the event told me that he 
thought it was the most impres
sive array of celebrities that they 
have seen in the town all year, 
Hale said. Celebrities like Clint 
Eastwood, Sidney Poitier, Arnold 
Schwarzenegger, and Neil Simon 
all attended the event.
Other benefits have resulted 
from the event as well, according 
to Yorkin. This is the first year 
ever that Disney (the studio) has 
set up a time to come and meet 
students and graduate students 
that are graduating for prospec
tive positions. So its helped all 
the way down that line, he said.
Jay Carson said that this event 
will serve as a model for future 
ones. The entire event was con
structed so that it can be repli
cated on an annual or an every 
other year basis. We have a num
ber of celebrity alumni who might

be honored at another time for 
their excellence in the arts and 
we might be able to do a similar 
type of thing and leverage their 
connections and network in the 
Hollywood community on behalf 
of the university, he said, We 
have every intention of trying to 
do this again.
This event really helped us to 
sort of broaden our profile a bit, 
so for that reason I think it is 
something we will look at for the 
future as a way to raise our vis
ibility in the west coast, said 
Hale.
Bud Yorkin originally came up 
with the idea for the event a year 
ago. He said, I knew that they

were talking about raising money 
for the Purnell Center and how 
can we make Carnegie Mellon 
more visible in Los Angeles, basi
cally the heart of where [some]

thought one way to make it vis
ible is to throw an affair where 
we could not only raise money, 
but we could get the publicity and 
so forth that the school has never 
gotten out here.
Bud Yorkin also played a major 
role in getting the project past 
the initial phase. [He] worked 
tirelessly for the last several 
months, all day and off into the
evening, to make this project 
work. He really had a creative 
idea of how this would go, said 
Carson. Carson also cited the 
work of several members of the 
CMU community. He said, It 
was really a team effort.
There were several packages 
available for those attending. 
Besides the $250-per-plate 
evening offering, a $50,000 pack
age included two tables of tickets 
as well as options like entry to 
the VIP cocktail party, and a gold 
page ad in the program. Approxi
mately 200 younger alumni were 
able to attend the event through 
tickets paid for by benefactors, 
according to Jay Carson.

lievable the lack of availability 
of bands for this weekend. Its 
not that the bands were previ
ously booked  they are either 
recording, not performing, or 
out of the country.
According to Jill Goodall, the 
chair of AB and fifth-yearscholar psychology major, it is 
not unusual for the first offer 
AB makes on a band to be de
clined. She said, We are not in 
danger right now of not having 
a band. We are just looking for
most popular artists, but al
most all of these bands were 
unavailable. The committee 
can only make one offer at a 
time because if a band accepts, 
they are legally bound to pro
duce the concert. The offer to 
Barenaked Ladies was the 
first the committee sent out. 
Once an offer is sent out, it 
takes approximately a week 
to get a reply.
Warneck said, It is difficult 
to book major artists more than 
two or three months in advance. 
I think we are in the right time 
frame at this time.

U.S. News ranks programs
RANKINGS, from page 1
affairs and professor ofECE, said, 
Being ranked highly, the top stu
dents are attracted. The impact 
has been positive on CIT.
Accordingto Christiano, CMUs 
small size sometimes hinders it 
from competing with other 
highly-ranked institutions. Of the 
schools in the top 20, only Cal 
Tech is smaller than CMU.
You will always find a high 
correlation between how large 
they are and how highly they are 
ranked. When youre small, 
theres no way you can offer the 
same number of programs as 
when you are large. Where we 
compete, we compete very well, 
said Christiano.
Regardless of this disadvan
tage, GSIA has managed to re
main 14th in the nation from last 
year. Business schools are ranked 
according to student selectivity, 
placement success, and reputa
tion. CMU received 93.6 points 
out of 100, coming in behind 
schools such as Duke University 
and NYU. Yale falls behind CMU 
at 15.
The Management Information 
Systems program, the Produc
tions/Operations program, and 
the Qualitative Analysis program 
have all been ranked second in 
the departmental categories be
hind MIT. Stanford was ranked 
first overall.

increase the number of applica
tions for a given program. Bryan 
Rogers, the head of the Art De
partment and an art professor, is 
waiting to see if the leap from 
20th to sixth will affect the num
ber of applications. Currently, 
only six students are accepted 
annually into the graduate pro
gram, and the competition is ex
pected to get stiffer.

California Institute of the Arts, 
Indiana University, and the Uni
versity of Iowa. The schools reThe thing that is unusual this year is

various constituencies of GSIA to 
achieve our rightful position in 
the top 10, said GSIA Dean Dou
glas Dunn.
i Accordingto Christiano, receiv
ing a low ranking or not being 
Ranked at all helps pinpoint weak 
reas. When we can look at the 
lements of things that went into 
tihe rankings we can determine 
\vhere we ought to do better, 
aid Christiano. I dont think we 
can ever be satisfied with our
selves. We might want to improve 
qn the underlying factors that go 
ipto the rankings.
! High rankings promote the vis
ibility of the school and tend to
ceived 3.9 points out of 5. Yale 
University and the School of the 
Art Institute of Chicago are 
among the schools that received 
higher rankings. I think the Art 
Department here has a great deal 
to be proud of. [The rankings] 
will probably increase the appli
cations, said Christiano.
This is a new program, so we 
are particularly delighted that 
the word has gotten around about 
it, said Rogers. The program 
was not ranked in 1994. In 1995 
and 1996, it was ranked 20.
The thing that is unusual this 
year is the climb by the fine arts 
program, said Don Hale, vice
Tartan Production Staff 
president ofUniversity Relations.
The drama program was also 
ranked sixth, receiving an aver
age reputation score of 3.8. CMU 
is tied with the American Con
servatory Theater and is behind 
schools such as Yale and New 
York University (NYU).
Christiano expressed disap
pointment that the music pro
gram was not ranked. Because 
rankings are subjective, areas 
that seem worthy of recognition 
by some may be overlooked by 
others. I think we have some 
qualities that have not yet been 
recognized because I think it 
takes time to get the reputa
tion. In music we ought to be 
ranked high and we are not, 
said Christiano.
Several graduate programs of
fered by the University were not 
evaluatedby U.S. News and World 
Report because only certain areas 
are evaluated each year.
For example, subject areas in 
the College of Humanities and 
Social Sciences and the Mellon 
College of Science were not evalu
ated this year.
I think the general consensus 
of students and faculty who care 
one way or the other has been 
that national rankings do not 
always give us our due, in part 
because we are younger with 
smaller, diverse departments 
and do not have the long tradi
tion of most other schools with 
whom we are compared, said 
Michael Murphy, dean of stu
dent affairs.
CFA cancels class for festival
By JAYA SAXENA
Tartan Staffwriter
CFA students will be excused 
from classes on March 11 and 
12 to participate in the Jill 
Watson Festival of the Arts. 
Wats: On? will take place in 
CFA, Margaret Morrison Hall, 
and the University Center, in 
honor of Jill Watson, a master 
of fine arts candidate and ad
junct professor of architecture 
at CMU, who died in TWA 
Flight 800 crash that occurred 
last July.
Watson received her bachelor 
of architecture degree from 
CMU in 1987. She went on to 
have a distinguished career, 
receiving many awards for a 
variety of designs in the greater 
Pittsburgh area as well as the 
honor of being one of the Ameri
can Institute of Architects four 
outstanding architects in west
ern Pennsylvania. She worked 
with the idea of space in archi
tecture. The identity of a space 
is constructed from a reading of 
the other spaces represented 
within it, she once said.
I think Jills work and her 
theory of interspatiality pro
vide us with an example of a 
way to work, see and live differ
ently than we do and have, his

architect I ever met. She was 
very interested in several disci
plines including philosophy, cul
tural studies, and art, said 
Arthur Lubetz, of Arthur Lubetz 
Associates, a Pittsburgh archi
tecture firm that Watson previ
ously worked for. The annual 
festival is of great value; it is not 
a simple celebration of Jill and 
her work (although it is very much 
that), it is a creative, pedagogical 
process which is immediately rel
evant and which we can all learn 
from, said Hung. My hope is 
that through this and future fes
tivals, a context will be created 
for experimentation and inter
creation in the arts, she said.
It will give students the oppor
tunity to take a few days from 
their own studies to reflect on 
what theyre accomplishing and 
why, and to get a sense of whats 
going on in other departments, 
said Craig Vogel, associate pro
fessor of design and associate 
dean of CFA aiid a coordinator of 
the event.
Only CFA students will be ex
cused from classes for this festi
val. In the past, we have had a 
problem in making sure we cre
ated events that could accommo
date all students, said Vogel. 
For non-CFA students, we hope 
they defer the right to attend 
programs to CFA students, but if 
an event is open, it is fine for 
other students to take advantage 
of that, he said. Vogel does hope 
the event will be expanded to the 
entire CMU community as well 
as the surrounding 
area in the future. I 
hope that the rest of 
the University will 
be patient and re
spect the need for 
this to grow out of 
CFA into
aUniversity event, 
said Vogel. CFA will 
co-televise the event 
and a broadcast will 
be open to the pub
lic in the CFA Great 
Hall.
The idea behind 
[it] was to create an 
event that brought 
the different depart
ments ofthe College 
of Fine Arts (CFA) 
together around a 
central idea, and Jill 
Watsons memory 
seemed an appro
priate theme, said Vogel.
Vogel worked with Elaine 
King, associate professor of art 
history and theory, and Lubetz 
in planning the event.
According to Vogel there are 
three primary purposes of the 
event. We tend to be so rooted 
in our own departments and 
its very important for students, 
in their four years here, to get a 
broader scope of CFA. We have 
brought in a number of cel
ebrated individuals in their 
field which we hope will inspire 
students from every conceiv
able perspective, and it is very 
important to honor Jill 
Watsons memory, he said.
Some internationally known 
people are coming to this event. 
No matter what anyones point 
of view is, they can learn by 
participating in these events 
and hearing what people of 
other disciplines are saying,  
said Lubetz.
The festival was funded by 
the Jill Watson Endowment 
and CFA.
Although Vogel did not per
sonally work with Watson, he 
said, I certainly am aware of 
her tremendous impact on 
CMU, CFA, and the commu
nity, and I have learned more 
about her as I helped to develop 
this event.
The event will feature 17 
guests including Stelarc, an 
international performance art
ist who has explored body-ma
chine relationships, and John 
Shaffner and Joe Stewart, 
drama department alumni and 
Emmy-Award winning produc
tion designers, who have done 
work for programs such as 
Friends, and The Drew Carey 
Show.
CMU graduate and under
graduate students will also be 
performing during the festival. 
Peter Coppin and Alexi Daniel, 
graduate students in the Art 
Department and colleagues of 
Watson, will be conducting 
Telephone Booths, an instal
lation that allows participants 
to communicate with individu
als at the Youth Development 
Center, a state-run correctional 
facility for underage offenders 
of adult crimes.
A schedule of events for the fes
tival is available on the Web site

Fight with Dining Services official instigates vendors removal
VENDOR, from page 1
sionalism. We went to the back 
room [to discuss the sign] and he 
used the F-word, he said. Then 
he came back out again and tried 
to move the sign. He said, Thats 
it, you touch me again and you go 
to jail, man.
Fulmer denies that he used 
profanity when speaking to 
Sreevardhan.
After Sreevardhan moved the 
sign again, Fulmer called Cam
pus Police andhis supervisor Neil 
Binstock vice president of Busi
ness Services, then left the area 
to wait for an officer.
Binstock informed
Sreevardhan of his removal from 
campus facilities and that he 
would be arrested if he returned 
to campus.
Tensions between Srees Foods 
and Dining Services date back to 
February 1995 when Srees Foods 
and Taste of India began selling 
lunches daily in Porter Hall with
out a contract or visible Health 
Department permit.
Dining Services had some wor
ries about being reported to the 
Health Department, said 
Fulmer. The food was sitting 
there for two hours in Styrofoam 
cartons. There was no way they 
were keeping it in temperature. 
We worried about the health and 
welfare of the students.
When Campus Police re
sponded to reports of a disagree
ment between two vendors in 
Porter Hall in December 1995, 
the University asked all vendors 
to leave CMU facilities. But due 
to the popularity of Indian food
among students, Dining Services 
invited Srees Foods to move into 
the basement of Building D and 
purchased an Allegheny Health 
Department permit for the build
ing D location.
Sreevardhan signed a letter of 
agreement with the University 
in January 1996 which stated 
that Srees Foods would pay CMU 
10 percent commission on gross 
sales. The contract expired in 
May.
Although Sreevardhan agreed 
to the contract, he failed to make 
payments to CMU. According to 
Business Services, Sreevardhan 
made one payment of $500 in 
April, but made no other attempt 
to keep to the terms of the agree
ment.
Sreevardhan said he broke the 
agreements because Dining Ser
vices ignored his complaints of 
space restraints in Building D. 
He met with Dining Services 
Allison three times to address 
the problem.
Every time I went to these 
meetings, [Allison] said she was 
sending [Fulmer] to fix the prob
lem but nothing was done, 
Sreevardhan said. I have no idea 
if they didnt like us or that they 
didnt care about it.
He told Allison that he would 
not pay the commission until Din
ing Services looked into the space 
issue.
Sreevardhan also neglected his 
responsibilities as a campus ven
dor accordingto Fulmer. He failed 
to return daily cash register re
ports, close the register after each 
sale, and supply the customers
with a printed receipt. Fulmer 
said all procedures are listed in 
the Cash Register Procedure 
Manual published by Dining Ser
vices to maintain accurate records 
of transactions carried out by 
vendors.
Space was only one of the com
plaints against Dining Services 
that Sreevardhan held. 
Sreevardhan was unhappy about 
the competition from Taste of 
India in Building D. Both 
Sreevardhan and Fulmer tried to 
find new feasible locations on 
campus for Srees Foods, but ac
cording to Fulmer Sreevardhan 
refused to move once a new place 
was found.
We tried to get the [room be
hind Srees current location, be
longing to CMU Robotics], said 
Fulmer. We went through sev
eral areas to look for a space. It 
was very difficult, because Din
ing Services cannot actually re
quest space from the University.
Unprofessional relations be
tween Fulmer and vendors were 
not uncommon, according to 
Sreevardhan. He said that 
Fulmer was bribed by Taste of 
India owner Haijid Singh to force 
Sreevardhan to sublease his space 
to Singh. He said that at a proce
dural meeting between Dining 
Services officials and the two ven
dors at Singhs restaurant, Singh 
offered Fulmer champagne and 
Gateway Clippership tickets as 
gifts.
It was a big bash, a party-type 
atmosphere, said Sreevardhan.
Fulmer and Singh both deny 
such accusations. At one point
[Allison] and I went out and in
spected the kitchen, making sure 
it was up to Health Department 
standards, but there was no 
champagne, said Fulmer. I cant 
drink alcohol, because I get mi
graines.
Sreevardhan said Fulmers 
misconduct included kicking 
boxes, the shutting off of electricity on two occasions and the use 
of profanity when speaking to 
vendors.
Campus vendors Kelly Garrity, 
manager of Papa Js Mercato and 
Dave Hill, manager of the Bagel 
Factory and Sweet News, dis
agree with Sreevardhans accu
sations against of Fulmer. Frank 
Fulmer is a great guy, from the
business end of it, said Garrity. 
He seems to be one of the most 
efficient people in Dining Ser
vices. Weve had no problems. 
Weve done a lot to improve 
Dining Services over the last 
couple of years and to have some
thing like this overshadow the 
whole thing, it kind of gets to 
you, said Fulmer.

FORUM
Carnegie Mellon University10 March 1997
Conference spotlights 
womens issues
Mosaic, the first annual womens 
conference at CMU took place last 
Sunday in the University Center. 
The programs and lectures that 
were open to all students targeted 
issues that most undergraduate 
women face during their college 
years as well as issues that are 
especially pertinent to under
graduate women at CMU.
On a campus with a male/female 
ratio of70/30, women need an out
let to voice their concerns about 
under representation. While the 
Womens Center provides this out
let for some, others on campus are 
uncomfortable discussing topics in 
such a forum. For these people, 
and for any member of campus 
concerned with womens issues, 
Mosaic was a unique and benefi
cial opportunity.
The lectures and workshops gave 
students a chance to simply sit 
and listen or to ask questions if 
they desired. The conference in
cluded a wide range of topics, vary
ing from women in non-traditional 
fields to how to deal with sexual 
assault. The broad coverage of 
subjects stemmed from student 
input which was a heavy factor in 
the planning of the event. The 
Role Models Board was elected by 
students, prior to the conference, 
which was an effective way of spot
lighting successful women faculty, 
especially since the ratio of male 
to female professors mirrors the 
undergraduate population at
CMU. The prominence of these 
six women in the panel provided 
students with the opportunity to 
meet and speak with highly ac
complished female professionals 
who are eager to help them cope 
with a stressful academic and 
social environment such as CMU.
The speakers presented topics 
such as women in the classroom 
in a way that benefited not only 
female students, but male stu
dents and faculty as well. The 
lectures tried to allow all stu
dents to view themselves as a 
feminists, a term that generally 
intimidates both men and women 
because of the stereotypes that 
people tend to associate with it. 
At the conference, lecturers and 
panelists presented the femi
nist as someone interested in 
promoting equality for women, 
giving the word a positive con
notation.
Mosaic was sponsored by all 
colleges on campus and a large 
number of administrative offices 
such as the Presidents Office and 
the Office of the Dean of Student 
Affairs. These groups should be 
commended for taking the first 
step in establishing such a re
source for CMU men and women. 
Hopefully, the successful turn
out (150 registered students) and 
continued support will bring an
other womens conference to 
CMU next year and in the years 
to follow.
Welcome to Forum, 
your place for opinions
Newspapers in general are rela
tively predictable  theres the 
news section, the sports section, 
and the comics, usually along with 
living and entertainment sections. 
Often, there is very little opportu
nity to respond to what we see in 
print. At The Tartan, we find a lot 
of value in the exchange and in the 
frequent clash of ideas. The Fo
rum pages are our way of fostering 
free exchange of ideas, so we try to 
provide a spectrum of opinions to 
allow you, our readers, to be the 
judges. To that end, youll find the 
following types of pieces in this 
section:
Editorials always appear in the 
leftmost columns of the first Fo
rum page. They are unsigned be
cause they represent a consensus 
opinion of The Tartans Editorial 
Board.
While we believe our editorials 
offer sensible, accurate commen
tary, please feel free to disagree 
with us  we dont have a mo
nopoly on the truth. As a matter of 
fact, we would love to know what 
you think of what we think. An 
excellent means to do this is to 
write a letter to the editor.
Letters to the Editor may be sub
mitted by anybody, although when 
space gets tight we will favor let
ters from members of the Univer
sity community. As readers, you 
should realize that opinions rep
resented in a letter are those ofthe 
author and not of The Tartan. All 
letters are subject to editing for 
size  letters cant be more than 
500 words  and grammar. But 
we never edit a letter for content.
Julee White/Tartan Art EditorEvil aliens control fashion world
Rebecca Fribush
Of course, we reserve the right 
to reject letters we feel are libel
ous, obscene, or incoherent. But 
well be glad to discuss any letter 
with the author and see if we can 
reach a compromise. However, 
in order to have such a discus
sion, we need to know who you 
are. We are willing to withhold 
the authors name from a letter 
to the editor, but our editor-inchief does need to know who wrote 
it. Please, dont send us anony
mous letters  it just frustrates 
us because we have no way to 
contact you, and it annoys you 
because your letter doesnt get 
published.
Persons Opinion is just that  
the opinions of randomly polled 
persons, usually students at 
CMU, on a different question or 
concern each week. The people in 
Persons Opinion have no affilia
tion with The Tartan.
Columns are regularly appear
ing opinion pieces presented by 
individuals who are usually mem
bers of the CMU community. 
Unsolicited columns generally 
cannot be used, though if you feel 
the desire to contribute regularly, 
contact the Forum editor. Opin
ions in these columns are those 
of the columnist and not of The 
Tartan. Again, feel free to dis
agree with them and to let them 
know, through a Letter to the 
Editor.
That about sums up the Forum 
section. We hope it makes for 
some thought-provoking reading, 
and were always open to sugges
tions for ways to improve it.
Imagine this: after a long day of classes, 
youve picked up a magazine and are all 
set to blissfully rot your brain into sub
mission. However, you havent gotten 
very far at all when you come across the 
disturbing picture of a young lady whose 
own brain, if she ever had one, was 
obviously allowed to rot out of existence 
long, long ago. The girl stares vacantly 
out of glazed-over, purple-rimmed eyes. 
Her dress may be ugly, but at least the 
sleeves are long enough to cover any 
needle scars. She appears to be wearing 
a 12-inch measuring tape as a belt. You 
shudder and close the magazine  you 
certainly didnt intend to look through 
Kiddie Porn Monthly.
Welcome to the wonderful world of 
fashion. High fashion captivates me in 
the same way that alien life captivates 
others. Its culture and outlook are so 
different from those of us who live back 
on Earth that I can only watch with a 
mixture of horror and twisted fascina
tion. You know how aliens in movies all 
look exactly alike?
Same idea with models. All of these 
unnaturally thin women with the same 
cookie-cutter features, uniformly 
haughty pouts, and vacant, staring eyes 
may as well have stepped out of the 
imagination of some science-fiction
writer suffering from latent pedophilia. 
From the looks of things, their planet 
perfected the cloning technology way 
before we did.
I see only two important differences 
between fashion models and creatures 
from deepest, darkest space: one, no
body has thought of selling clothes by 
photographing aliens wering them; and 
two, no one quits eating and starts 
slathering on make-up in order to look 
more like a Martian. If I had a dollar for 
every woman whos been nudged toward 
anorexia after years of seeing malnour
ished models, Id probably be able to 
afford a whole designer ensemble by 
now. Not that it necessarily would fit 
me. Besides, considering that high-fashion clothing is getting uglier and uglier 
every year, I have a feeling Id be much 
better off continuing to shop at Crimes 
of Fashion.
It makes you wonder what planet the 
designers are from. One would think 
that theyd create their clothes with at 
least half an eye towards attracting 
people to buy them. Yet it seems that, on 
whichever planet they hail from, good 
business sense is as rare as 90-pound 
waifs are common.
Transparent dresses over flesh-toned 
bodysuits? The corsets that were sup
posedly in style a few years ago? I could 
have sworn that some of the stuff they 
sent down fashion runways this year 
looked eerily reminiscent of those lumi
nescent orange robes that aliens in Bmovies are always wearing.
But if you really want incontrovertible
proof that were not dealing with Earth
ling minds at work here, I can only refer 
you to the Padded Dress. This lovely 
piece of clothing, in which youre meant 
to shove weirdly-shaped foam inserts up 
a skin-tight dress, for that Hunchback 
of Notre Dame after extensive plastic 
surgery look, represents the pinnacle of 
uselessness. The designer responsible 
for this mumbles something about re
thinking the body. Any woman who 
puts this on may transform herself into 
a walking, talking piece of avant-garde 
art, but shell still look like a snake who 
swallowed a Rottweiler.
Who the hell buys this stuff? More 
importantly, who the hell can afford to? 
Five-figure prices for dresses, four for 
suits, even that measuring-tape belt 
would probably set you back a hun
dred or so. The padded dress is a bar
gain at $640.
Its a conspiracy, I tell you. I can see it 
all. Designers charge great gobs of money 
for clothing that was really just recycled 
from alien thrift shops in order to funnel 
the funds to their home planets cloning 
research center. The scientists agree to 
clone some poor creature who was born 
with permanently pouting lips and a 
negative amount of body fat so that the 
designers dont lack for things who can 
wear their clothes. And you thought 
cloning sheep was odd.
Becca Fribush is a freshman history 
major whos been at CMU long enough to 
start looking to cheesy science fiction as 
a way to explain everything.
Government taxes prevent ownership
James Stepanek
OK, I want to 
set some ground 
rules. If anyone 
disagrees with 
these ground 
rules, they should 
give up on this col- ^^umn n0Wj since 
everything that follows is derived from these rules. Here 
they are: slavery is evil, and theft is wrong.
Ill assume that everyone agrees with these simple asser
tions. They are quite straightforward, and appeal to one as 
simple moral truths. However, once these simple axioms 
acquire a bit of window dressing, a lot of people discard them.
What do I mean by that? I
mean that if enough people 
get together, form a govern
ment, and decide to take my 
stuff in what they consider a 
legal manner (i.e. taxes), 
people somehow rationalize 
this as not being theft. The 
government takes a huge 
chunk of what people earn 
and gives it to other people.
There are some services the government does provide that 
taxpayers do benefit from, but a large number of them are 
worthless. If the government provided a service commensu
rate for what one paid, it would not be theft. I guess some 
might find theft a strong word, but fraud is the only other 
possible description. Armed robbery is probably the best 
term, in that if you dont pay up as much as the government 
demands, armed men come and lock you up (or shoot you if 
you resist).The reach of this theft goes beyond taxes; it 
includes regulation of what people are permitted to do in 
almost every area. Ones property is not sacrosanct, but 
merely something malleable by the state. Let me put some
thing forth here that should be understandable to all. If you 
agree with the postulates that slavery and theft are wrong, 
then you have to accept that property is a right, or you have 
no moral grounds for disputing slavery and theft. How can 
theft be wrong if no one owns property? On the most funda
mental level of property rights, one owns oneself, and through
the violation of this right, slavery is wrong. Ownership is the 
basis upon which rights are built.
Free speech is about ownership and transferral of knowl
edge. Freedom of religion is about ownership of belief. The 
right to life is about owning yourself (and implicit in this right 
is the right to defend that life, and thus ownership of arms). All 
of the other rights do, at some level, come down to your right 
to own things, including yourself. It is only with the abolition 
of this right to own things that rights are discarded.
Let me clarify what I mean by ownership. Ownership does 
not merely mean having legal title; it also means the right to j 
control that which you own. If you own a factory, but the j 
government controls everything you produce and how you do 
business, you really dont own anything  youre merely * 
caretaker for the government.
Of course, popular society 
manages to rationalize ! 
these things. It decides that 
some people are too rich 
or something, and thus de
serve to have their rights 
trampled. The government 
thinks that just because >
__________________________ million people decide to take j
your property, it is no longer 
theft. Im sorry, but the fact that the majority wants it i 
doesnt always make it right.
Put simply, property rights have to be sacrosanct, otherwise 
all other rights are on the chopping block. Also let me disabuse 
you of the notion that property rights include such gibberish as 1 
the right to housing, a good wage, medical care, and a com
puter for every child (?!?). When these things are referred to as 
rights, it is with the implicit assumption that you will be given 
them through an act of the go vernment and not through your 
own labors. All of the above can be your property and thus your 
right if you work for them; however, if the government makes | 
someone else do the work to provide you with them, you are 
condoning theft, and actively profiting from it, and that simply 
isnt right.
James Stepanek is a PhD candidate in materials sci
ence engineering. He welcomes any responsible replies to j 
his column.
",Armed robbery is probably the 
best term, in that if you dont pay 
up as much as the government 
demands, armed men come and 
lock you up.

Psychology 101: Should we be guinea pigs?
Experiments supplement classroom
Diana Bartolotta
Why are we required to participate in 
psychology experiments?
A student is required to participate in 
three one-hour experiments over the 
course of the semester of his first two 
psychology classes.
If both of these classes are during the 
same semester, he is only required to 
participate in the experiments for one 
class. If he does not want to participate, 
for whatever reason, he is allowed to 
write a paper instead.
Why are we asked to do this. What is a 
better way to learn than through handson learning? We learn through several 
media in our classes  readings, class
room demonstrations, computer activi
ties, and videos, just to name a few. There 
is yet another way.
We are not just reading about what 
the rest of the world is doing; we are 
actually part of it.
Of course, this requirement helps re
searchers, too. Because the subject 
pool is only college students, extrapo
lating the findings to the rest of the 
world is difficult.
Researchers cannot say that the whole 
world will behave a certain way, based on 
the way that college students such as 
those at at CMU behave in a lab.
But if students were not required to 
participate, experimenters would have to 
pay people, and only students who needed 
the money or were extremely interested 
in research would participate.
Not all students would fall into this 
category, and therefore, the participants 
of the study would not be an accurate 
sample of our students.
The results of the study would only 
show that a certain subgroup of stu
dents behaved in a certain way, which 
could not even be generalized to the 
entire student body.
To know how the students here behave, 
we need to sample people from every 
group at CMU, not just certain subgroups. 
Although the students in Introduction to 
Psychology do not accurately represent 
the world, they do so more closely than
paid participants would.
One possible objection to this require
ment is that finding an additional three 
hours is difficult with our already de
manding course loads. When a particular 
course is developed, the fact that we have 
to complete these experiments is taken 
into account.
Three experiments is the number found 
by which we learn something without 
being overwhelmed. Because there are 
many different studies to participate in 
each semester, a student has many
Departmental requirements unfair
Alex Lewin
I felt like a complete fool. I was seated 
alone in a small room, with my finger 
connected to an electronic blood pressure 
gauge, and made to do various stressful 
or non-stressful mental exercises. The 
purpose was to correlate blood pressure
choices, depending on his interests and 
class schedule.
Another objection is that we are forced 
to participate in research.
First, a student can leave the study at 
any time if he feels uncomfortable, and 
still receive full credit for participating. 
He does not even need to give a reason. 
Second, if he still is not comfortable with 
participating, he can write the paper.
His grade is not affected in any way by 
which option he chooses.
The experimenters are not the only 
ones who benefit from our participation 
in psychology experiments. We learn more 
about the material we are studying and 
about ourselves.

major and the Tartan Darkroom Man

plies to her column. Meanwhile, she en

with stress. One of these exercises in
cluded arguing both sides of the issue, 
Should animals be slaughtered for hu
man consumption? My instructions, as 
relayed by my friendly tester, Andy, were 
to talk to a video camera for four minutes 
about why I thought animals should be 
slaughtered, and then for four minutes 
arguing the opposite  and I was not 
allowed to stop talking. In both intervals, 
I ran out of things to say after two min
utes  I talked fast because I was wor
ried that I wouldnt have enough time to 
say everything  and then resorted to 
such intellectual and well-thought-out 
arguments like, You dont see cows walk
ing around wearing jackets made of hu
man skin, do youV
This was one of three psychology ex
periments in which I participated during 
my freshman year, when I took Cognitive 
Processes: Theory and Practice. Certain 
psychology courses require all their stu
dents to participate as subjects in three 
experiments over the course of a semes
ter.
These courses force students to be un
willing subjects. I felt like a malfunction
ing robot at the mercy of my tester.
The only alternative, if you do not wish 
to participate in the experiments, is to 
write a research paper. But what kind of 
a system is it where a professor tells the 
students, You may either be a guinea pig 
in an experiment or you may write a 
research paperbut you must do one or 
the other.?
This is not the same as simply assign
ing a homework assignment or a class 
project. Such assignments are factored 
into the nine units of credit a student 
receives for the class. The experiments 
(or paper) are not.
Nine units means that a student, os
tensibly, does nine hours of work per 
week for that class, including actual class 
meetings. Over the course of the 14-week 
semester, that comes out to 84 hours of 
work outside of class meetings. Are we to 
believe that in planning 85-xxx, the pro
fessor expects that three of those 84 hours 
will be filled by psychology experiments? 
This isnt something the professor con
siders as part of the assigned tasks for his 
or her course.
If the department needs guinea pigs, 
they ought to offer to pay their subjects 
(as some experiments do). Yes, this may 
create a bias in that only certain types of 
people will volunteer themselves for cer
tain experiments, and thus the results 
will be skewed. But why not advertise the 
fact that students can earn a couple bucks 
by participating in an experiment with

Writer resents lack of peaceful vacation time
Michael Sperger
How many times have you had 
a project due the first class after 
spring break? The feeling of dread 
; crawls into your chest as you look 
at the course syllabus, do the 
calendar math, and realize that 
your major paper is due the day 
you get back from your vacation. 
You have planned a big road trip 
with a couple of friends down to 
Florida for the week, and there 
wontbe any computer clusters in 
Panama City Beach. In a hesitant 
voice you ask, Is this paper really 
due right after spring break? 
Yes, your professor responds. 
You didnt have plans, did you? 
I know from my own experi
ence and from the loud com
plaining of others around me
reasons that when a company 
expects creativity from its em
ployees without giving them time 
to recharge their batteries, the com
pany deserves all the criticism it 
gets for overworking its people. A 
healthy life in work, Adams argues,
that this phenomenon is not as 
rare as it ought to be. And so I 
wish to deliver the message well 
before spring break arrives: Its 
rotten to assign homework due 
immediately after a break.

I wish to deliver the message well 
before spring break arrives: It's 
rotten to assign homework due im
mediately after a break. 
When you look back on your own 
time in school, do you remember 
more fondly doing homework or 
spending time with friends out
side of classes? If your best memo
ries lean toward time spent with 
friends, consider whether you as 
a teacher are giv
ing your students 
the same opportu
nities to lead full 
lives outside of 
school by not piling 
work on them as 
they head out the 
door for holidays 
and breaks. But if 
your best memories lean toward 
doing homework, can you imag
ine that not every one of your 
students wants to have the same 
experience that you did?
There exists a wide range of 
options for students who want to 
cut loose and relax with the break
time the university gives us. But cmu.edu.
how valuable can they be when 
our instructors, consciously or 
not, undercut the purpose of our 
holidays and breaks? I do not 
present this argument solely be
cause my bitterness about spring 
break assignments has stayed 
remarkably fresh since my first 
experiences with them freshman 
year. There is more at stake here 
than the whining of the marginal 
student. Our school has a reputa
tion among its own students for 
imposing excessive academic de
mands on those who have come 
here to learn. The workload would 
feel much lighter if occasionally 
it relented.

Craig Soules/Tartan Systems ManagerCommittees selections make for tournament upsets
Man
Ronak Singhal
Its March again, which means 
that in addition to looking for
ward to spring break and St. 
Patricks Day, there is a little 
tournament to decide the best 
mens college basketball team in 
America. This year, the commit
tee that chooses and seeds the 
teams have rewarded teams that 
have played well down the 
stretch, especially in the final 
weekend of play. This is not nec
essarily a bad thing, except that 
it creates a field of highly seeded 
teams that are not as good as 
some lower seeded teams but 
have been placed higher because 
of a few high profile wins.
Evidence? Look at the East 
Region where California is a 
number five seed. Many felt this 
was a bubble team, but 
Saturdays win against Arizona
moved them up in a big way. 
Also in the East, Wisconsin is 
number seven seed. Why? Mainly 
because of their win on Saturday 
over conference 
champion Minne
sota. In the South
east, Georgia is a 
number three seed, 
even though they 
have not cracked 
the top 15 all sea
son. This is largely 
based on two victo
ries over South 
Carolina and seems 
to ignore their three 
humbling losses to 
Kentucky. All these 
teams deserved to 
be in the tourna
ment, but ranking 
them so highly is sure to create 
quite a few upsets.
The committee also picked 
heavily from two conferences that 
have enjoyed little success the 
past few years  the Pac-10 and 
the Big 10. Most notably is the 
selection of USC into the tourna
ment, given that other quality 
teams such as Syracuse and 
Tulane were left out. The Big 10 
and the ACC both had six teams
make it to the tournament, but 
the quality of the teams they send 
is quite different. The ACC has 
five teams seeded number five or
Becky
higher, while Minnesota is the 
only Big 10 team that can make 
the same claim. Do not be sur
prised if Big 10 teams once again 
struggle.
In the East Region, those
Princeton Tigers have another 
great opportunity to pull an up
set of a Pac-10 team when they 
play Cal. Cals leading scorer, 
Ed Gray, is out for the sea
son. Do not be surprised if 
Villanova has difficulty 
beating Long Island Uni
versity. Villanova is the 
most overrated team in the 
field, while LIU features 
the leading scorer in the 
nation.
The Southeast is headed 
by two very strong teams, 
Kansas and Duke, and a 
bunch of teams that co.uld 
pull an upset. The upstart 
to watch here is 
Marquette, who won four 
games in four days to win 
the Conference USA tour
nament. They have a tough first 
round game against Providence 
with the winner getting the privi
lege to play Duke. Again, the 
second-seeded team could have 
a lot of trouble in the second
round. But it doesnt matter be
cause the Jayhawks are just to 
strong for any of the teams here. 
Take Kansas from this region.
The Midwest is probably the 
most difficult region to predict. 
The number one seed, Minne
sota, is from the Big 10, which is
is upset-minded here. The 
Redskins are led by Devin Davis, 
who is known for unique hair. 
Two years ago, this team beat 
Arizona in the first round, so 
they know how to pull the up
set. They play a Clemson squad 
that comes limping into the tourAll these teams deserved to be in 
the tournament, but ranking them so 
highly is sure to create quite a few 
upsets. 
a strike against it to begin with. 
They potentially would have to 
play Temple in the second round, 
which is not every coachs 
dream. Watch for Temple to pull 
a big upset. Usually, this would 
open the way for the number 
two seeded team in the region, 
but here is UCLA, a team that 
lost by 48 points earlier this 
year to Stanford. Miami of Ohio
nament after a playing well ear
lier in the year. So, whos the 
team to watch here? Cincinnati 
was the preseason number one 
in most polls and although they 
have underachieved for much of 
the year, they have the broad 
shoulders of Danny Fortson 
(from Pittsburgh) to carry them.

Tartans spike RMC in five games
By BENJAMIN ROBERTS
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon Mens Volley
ball Team can no longer be referred to 
as simply, a first year team. Theyre 
very, very good. The Tartans trav
elled to Robert Morris College on Feb
ruary 28 for a cross-city matchup and 
won in four hard fought games. The 
Tartans came out smok
ing from the start. They 
won the first game 15-10 
behind the strong serving 
of Gordon Cheng (seven 
points), and behind a 
dominating front line led 
by senior John Warwick.
CMU capitalized on con
sistent mistakes by Robert ________
Morris by serving consis- HWIMRWMBMB 
tently, providing good sets, and play
ing smart, organized volleyball. The 
spirited Tartans rattled RMC with their 
original cheers, deridingthe home team 
whenever a ball was hit long or wide.
The second game was all Robert 
Morris. The Colonials came out a very
focused, cohesive unit. They took an 
early 5-4 lead, but CMU stormed back. 
Warwick had several outstandingpoints, 
blocking RMC slams three straight times 
on two occasions. CMU hung around, 
and only trailed 11-9 before the Colonials 
slammed the door, and won 15-10.
CMU took control in Game Three, win
ning 15-10, setting up a pivotal Game 
Four. RMC came out fighting, and led

suck it up, focus, and concentrate.

for much of this game. They had several 
game point opportunities to tie up the 
match, but squandered all of them. An 
especially pivotal point came at 8-8, af
ter CMU had blown a four point lead. 
Coach Dennis Jensen felt that that was 
a critical point. I told the guys that they
had to suck it up, focus, and concen
trate. Youhavetogetintoyourgame. 
For awhile, it looked as though there 
would be a Game Five. There wasnt. 
CMU trailed 14-12, before comingback 
to win the match, 1716 
Coach Jensen praised his team after 
the match. They all really stepped it 
up. We dont have any athletic power
houses, but were going to be the smart
est team youll ever 
play. We practice at 
wierd hours. Its tough 
on the schoolwork, and 
its tough on the social 
life, because you dont 
have one. But weve 
got a terrific group of
12-18 guys who, when 
we play together, are 
very tough to beat. I 
dont want to concentrate on our record 
(44) too much, because its our first 
year. Every time we win, its an upset. 
The thing thats impressed me the most 
is our team spirit. Thats something 
well have everytime youll see us play. 
Just ask Robert Morris.
Pens switch coach, 
but still slump along
Field events athletes excel at UAAs
By JOHN BIGGS
Tartan Contributing Editor
Upon returning from the UAAs held 
at Brandeis University in Boston, the 
track team was, at least, well-rested. 
I had ten hours of sleep a night, said 
MCS freshman Dave Shafer, It was a 
totally new experience.
Aside from extended visits to the 
land of Nod, the team fared well in a 
series of indoor track and field events. 
The womens team placed fourth (Rosie 
Perez, sophomore, MCS), fifth (Kerry 
Riley), and sixth (Alice Chong) in the 
shot put. Yumiko Yamada placed fifth 
in the high jump, and Margaret Pow
ers, a sophomore in CFA, placed an 
impressive second in the 1500-meters.
Both teams placed sixth, overall, 
said womens coach Dario Donatelli.  
Right now, were getting ready for 
outdoor meets, where we expect to 
improve greatly.
The mens team was also quite up 
to par. Peter Hunt, H&SS junior, 
came in second on the High Jump. 
Other notables for the men include 
second place work with the shot-put 
and Todd Kuzoki, who went home 
with second place in the triple jump, 
seventh in the long jump, and sixth 
in the high jump.
There were a few down faces after the 
meet. It was a pretty bad meet for me, 
becauseIdidntmakethefinals,saidShafer, 
The meet was at the most competitive level 
Ive seen in a while. He ran the 200,400, 
and anchored the 4x400-meter relay.
But not all members were so selfdepreciating. This year we had a good 
team spirit, said George Matcuk, MCS 
Junior, It was a great team effort. 
Matcuk, who ran on the relay team only 
a week after competing in relays for the 
mens swim team, also does the high jump.
The team enjoyed drinks and peanuts 
on the flight into Providence, where they
caught a bus to Boston. The chicken 
and pasta served at the nightly din
ners was also quite memorable. The 
team placed first in the race to the 
cookies at the awards banquet. We 
got the mother-lode, said Matcuk.
Separate from the championship, 
unner Maureen McGranaghan, H&SS 
sophomore, attended the National 
Championships at the University of 
Wisconsin Oshkosh this past weekend. 
After qualifying four weeks ago, 
McGranaghan began preparing for the 
meet and placed 11th in the 5000, an 
impressive performance.
McGranaghan also came in second 
in the 1500 and third in the 300 at the 
UAA, nearly breaking a school record 
in the process.
Were rededicatingourselvesrightnow 
for outdoor events, said Donatelli. CMU 
will be hosting the UAA outdoor champi
onships in April and both teams are 
looking forward to strong performances.
By JASON ANDRACKI
Tartan Senior Staffwriter
March 4 was the beginning of a new 
era for the Pittsburgh Penguins. Just 
the day before, coach Eddie Johnston 
was fired and general manager Craig 
Patrick began his second stint as GM/ 
coach. Patrick would not have an easy 
debut behind the bench as the Pens 
faced off against the surging New J ersey 
Devils.
Devils coach Jacques Lemaire, aware 
of the recent Penguins slump and rash 
of injuries, decided to start back- up 
Mike Dunham in place of All-Star 
goaltender Martin Brodeur. Brodeur 
would finish out the game, though, as 
Dunham later left with an injury.
Although the scoreboard shows the 
Pens losing 3-1, the game was one the 
Penguins could be proud of.
We played really strong, the way we 
wanted to play, Patrick said. We didnt 
get some goals early that I thought we 
were going to get. We had some good 
chances, we hit a post. We were playing 
against an excellent team, and I thought 
it was an excellent game.
At the half-way point of the game, the 
Penguins 16st two key players, Mario 
Lemieux and Garry Valk, who has been 
working well with Lemieux since com
ing over from Anaheim. Valk was issued 
a game misconduct on a very question
able call, a check from behind on Devils 
defenseman Shawn Chambers. Lemieux 
vehemently protested the call, earning 
himself a ten-minute misconduct that 
he wouldnt return from due to a nag
ging hip flexor. It kind of was an ugly 
game today because the referee made 
his show again and kind of kept us off 
our scoring, said Pens defenseman 
Darius Kasparaitis.
With Lemieux gone and Jaromir Jagr 
out for most likely the remainder of 
the season, the rest of the team had to 
step up their play. Alex Hicks and 
Greg Johnson worked hard on both 
ends of the ice, creating many scoring 
opportunities.
After playing over two and half peri
ods in a scoreless lock (the Devils scored
earlier in the second but it was disal
lowed since left wing Valeri Zelepukin 
was in the crease), the Devils broke the 
tie on a goal by Doug Gilmour. Gilmour, 
scoring in his seventh straight game, 
left the penalty box and drove in alone 
on Ken Wregget and beat him with a 
back-hand over the left shoulder. I my
self didnt see Gilmour get the puck, 
Patrick said.
I heard our guys on the bench yell
ing, then I looked up and saw him and 
he snuck in behind the defense. He 
made a smart play. He came off, got 
onside and then got the puck and made 
a great play.
Gilmour set up the second goal of the 
game as Bill Guerin gave the Devils a 
2-0 lead in the third period. The Pen
guins answered quickly; twenty sec
onds later, Hicks hit a streaking Jeff 
Christian with a pass that resulted in 
Christians first NHL goal. Hicks play 
was one of the bright spots in the 
Penguins loss. I felt real good, Hicks 
said. Im just coming off an injury, but 
I think finally tonight was the first time 
I felt like Im back in shape and Im 
ready to go here so hopefully we can 
continue to just get better.
The transition between the two 
coaches seemed smooth. Patrick kept 
his lines together more, a complaint 
that often plagued Johnston. The play
ers shared an optimistic outlook for the 
rest of the season.
He just brought in basically a similar 
but new forechecking style thats pursue-and-pressure style and I thought we 
executed pretty well tonight, said 
defenseman Kevin Hatcher. Im sure in 
the next couple weeks theres going to be 
a lot of things hell put in place, and as 
time comes, hopefully we can get every
thing down pat and well know exactly 
what everybodys doing on the ice and 
well be very effective.
Although a loss, Patrick was still 
pleased with the outcome of his first 
game as head coach. I thought every
body really worked hard, said Patrick. 
Everybody. I dont care if theyre grind
ers or scorers. Everybody worked hard 
throughout the evening.

If youre like me, and I just 
bet you are, when you first 
heard about this cloning deal 
you fantasized about making a 
whole team of your favorite ath
lete. But before youstart mak
ing your dream team of seven 
Jordans and five Wilt Cham
berlains, think about all the 
negative consequences this 
weird science would have. 
Cloning would turn the sports 
world into a huge game of 
Street Fighter, with all the lu
dicrous features to follow.
NFL defenses would turn into 
four Reggie Whites on the line, 
three Lawrence Taylors at line
backer (one Dick Butkus for 
some variety) and three Deion 
Sanders in the secondary. More 
likely than not, 
theyd probably 
be covering a 
run-and-shoot 
offense of five 
Jerry Rice clones.
Thats not parity, 
thats paltry.
Every game would 
become boring. How 
can there be a Great 
One, when every 
center of every 
line is a Gretzky.
Hockey would 
turn into a big 
all-sta 
game.
Stats 
would 
be meanTony Yu/Tartan Art Staff
ingless, free agency would be 
more chaotic than it is today, 
and I shudder to think what 
new definitions they could come 
up with for the double header.
With every prep player be
ing good enough to go straight 
to the pros, college sports 
might not even exist. The 
Olympics would probably have 
clone and non-clone divi
sions, baseball would be re
duced to games between the 
great Yankee teams, Kareem 
Abdul-Jabbar would sky hook 
over Lew Alcindor, and in to
tal obsurdity Muhamed Ali 
would float like a butterfly as 
Cassius Clay tried to sting him 
like a bee for twelve rounds.
Track and swimming, autoracing and needless to say 
horse-raching would be point
less. The only excitement would 
be to tune-in to see if a race 
ever wasnt a photo-finish.
The term rematch would lose 
all significance, extreme sports 
would probably be a lot less 
indiviualistic, and tennis or any 
other game with tournaments 
would be deja vu ad nauseum.
Playing 
.doubles 
would be 
confusing 
and the 
game of 
golf would 
have every
body run
ning around 
saying I am 
Tiger 
Woods.

Club places third to cup in Holy Grail tourney
By CHRIS CANNON
Tartan Sports Editor
We were able to come through 
and take that match without any 
problem, Jason Rennie said of 
the final match that secured his 
teams third place finish in the 
mixed foil of the Holy Grail tour
nament. CMU B and womens 
teams placed fifth and sixth re
spectively in the tournament, 
which was held in Skibo Gymna
sium February 22. The women 
competed with the men in a 
mixed division.
Rennie, the fencing club presi
dent, was injured in the groin 
before helping the A team prevail 
over West Virginia. I sat down 
on the tournament [floor] for a 
minute or two and didnt move 
much, he said.
Preliminary matches were held 
in two pools. CMU beat club En 
Guard in their pool, but then lost 
to them in the seeded matches.
A hard loss, Rennie said of 
the match with the eventual tour
ney winners. En Guard defeated
Kent States A-team, which had 
the best record after the pool scor
ing, in the other semi-final.
CMU did not do as well as we 
have done in the past, because 
most of its top fencers (seniors 
and graduates) did not partici
pate, including myself, said 
fencing club president Thibaut 
Conti. It is more of a transition 
year for us.
According to Rennie, the next 
time CMU will host a tourna
ment is October, but he looks 
forward to competing in other 
tournaments. We get flyers from 
other colleges, he said.
"We owe our continuing suc
cesses in collegiate competitions 
to oUr coach, Eva Marintcheva, 
former women's Bulgarian Na
tional and Olympic Coach," said 
Conti. Marintcheva has been 
training the CMU Fencing team 
since 1993.
Aron Schmid, Anatachoke 
Zen Osangthammanont, and 
Rennie make up CMUs mens 
A- team. Competitive teams con
sist of three fencers and an op
tional alternate. Will Ross, Oren 
Schmid, Ben Pugliese, and Ed 
Fessler are on the B-team. Feige 
Grundman, Tomoko Sano, and 
Rachael Pisciotta competed on 
the womens team. The club, 
which practices at 10:30 am 
Saturday mornings in Thistle 
Gymnasium, has about 15 fenc
ers altogether.
The foil is descended from 
18th-century court weapons and 
has a thin, flexible blade with a 
square cross-section and small 
bell guard.
For foil and epee, you can only 
score points by hitting with the 
top, said Rennie. The epee is 
similar to the dueling swords of 
the mid-19th century. They have 
a triangular cross-section, stiff 
blades, and large bell guards. Un
like foils, where points are scored 
only with touches to the torso 
(including the groin and back), 
epee fencers can score points any
where on the opponents body.
Sabres the only one where you 
can actually hit with the side of 
the blade, Rennie said. Sabres
Feige Grundman/Special to the Tartan 
Jason Rennie (left) and Aron Schmid (seated) watch as Zen duels against Kent States B-team.
originate from cavalry swords of 
the late 19th century and have 
light, flat blades and a knuckle 
guard. Touches are scored any
where above the opponents waist. 
Sabre technique emphasizes 
speed, feints, and strong offense, 
while epees focus on counter-at
tack and foils, defense.
Rennie said that it is unclear 
which sword would be most effec
tive in actual combat. Last week 
me and a guy tried it, said Rennie, 
referring to a practice match be
tween his foil and another fencers 
sabre. I beat him pretty good ... 
but hes only been [fencing] about 
six months.
The basic attack is a lunge. 
Besides simply advancing and 
retreating, other maneuvers in
clude the disengage (Moving the 
point of your blade around the 
bell of your opponents blade) 
and the beat attack, which is a 
light tap.
Another attack is the feign, 
said Rennie, [where you] move 
around the bell twice.
Defense consists of parrying 
and reposting. If someones at
tacking, you parry them, Rennie 
said. The repost is a counter-at
tack after a parry. Its usually 
put together with a lunge. 
Fencing is a combination of a 
physical and mental sport, said 
Rennie. Besides having the 
physical skills, it is also impor
tant to identify where the at
tacks are coming from.
If you dont use your mind ... 
youre not going to be a very good 
fencer.
Rennie said that the sport could 
be called physical chess, and 
noted that inj uries usually are not 
very severe. [They usually con
sist of] lots of blood vessels being 
popped, bruises all over the place. 
A touch hurts about as much as 
a hard tap on the shoulder. He 
mentioned stories where a mask 
is weak and the blade goes 
through and stabs people in the 
head. Ive never seen it [hap
pen], said Rennie.

Men rally, finish season on top
By JEREMY DeGROAT
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Down by 15 at halftime, CMLPs mens 
basketball team came back to finish a 
grueling year with a home victory against 
NCAA Tournament participant Roches
ter, 66-62.
Rochester started strong against a 
slightly weakened CMU squad. We had 
some trouble adjusting without our cen
ter Gary [Trendel]; we found out he 
wasnt going to play 45 minutes before
percent shooting. Also, we pretty much 
just chipped away at their lead. We 
never really had a big run. At ten min
utes, we were down by ten. At five min
utes, we were down by five and then we 
were able to hit a couple big shots to take 
the lead.
Making several of those big shots, se
nior guard and team captain Rich Bodnar, 
as he refused to let his collegiate career 
close with a loss, successfully launching 
five three-pointers, and finishing with 22 
points for the game. Bodnar was aided by
We pretty much just chipped away at their 
lead. We never really had a big run. 
junior guard Andy Sofish
the game and that I was going to start at 
center, says junior Colin Shaunnessey, 
We had some trouble on the boards 
without him.
In spite of missing first-team All-UAA 
center Trendels 12.5 ppg and 7.8 rpg, 
Carnegie Mellon was able to find the 
energy and motivation to pass Roches
ter for the win. The main keys to our 
comeback were defense and patience, 
added junior Andy Sofish, We really 
turned up the intensity on defense in the 
second half and held them to just 20
teammates Shaunnessey, and sopho
mores Tommy Praesel and Scott Mills, 
who each scored in double-digits (12,12, 
and ten points, respectively.)
The win offset a disappointing loss to 
non-conference opponent Thiel, 80-69, 
on the previous Thursday. In spite of 
getting blown out by CMU on the order 
of 27 points earlier in the year, Thiel was 
able to use quickness and outstanding 
shooting to beat the larger, more physi
cal Tartans, during the second meeting. 
I dont think we had enough intensity
on defense or on the boards, remarked 
Sofish. In our first meeting, we com
pletely controlled the boards and espe
cially in the second half, shut them down 
defensivly. Plus they shot the ball excep
tionally well; it seemed as if their point 
guard couldnt miss. Shaunnessey 
scored 13 points while Bodnar contrib
uted 12 points and 11 rebounds in the 
losing effort.
With the season over, the team turns 
its attention to next year. Season-long 
team improvement gives the team rea
son for optimism. Well have three re
turning starters, and a good nucleus of 
players with game experience, said 
sophomore Dan Bowersox. Hopefully I 
can fill Garys big shoes in the paint. We 
have a lot of potential, and if we can play 
as were capable, it should be a success
ful season for the Tartans.
I think if everyone works hard this 
off-season and comes in with good atti
tudes well be in good shape next year, 
Junior point guard LaDale Widmeyer 
said about the keys to success next year. 
There will be opportunities for some 
guys to step up and fill in the roles of our 
graduating seniors.
CMU graduates seniors Bodnar, 
Trendel, and guard Kevin Cackovic. 
Congratulations to these basketball play
ers on outstanding careers, and we wish 
them luck in the future.
Guru predicts upsets
NCAA, from page 9
while also keeping an eye on the Tulsa 
Golden Hurricane, if Shea Seals gets 
hot from outside.
The deepest region is clearly the 
West. Three of the top five players in 
the country  Ron Mercer, Keith Van 
Horn, and Tim Duncan  are in this 
region. Wake and Utah should lock 
horns in the Sweet 16. The Demon 
Deacons beat the Utes on New Years 
Eve already this year; if they get any 
sort of production from their guards, 
they should be able to do that again. 
The most intriguing match-up in the 
opening round has Wake Forest led by 
the best player in the nation, Duncan, 
against St. Marys which is led by a 
73, 345 pound center that is known 
as the Big Continent. Wake has been 
struggling recently but they should 
still be able to win this game.
Kentucky is a very good team that 
has trouble with teams that have 
good guards after the loss of Anothony 
Epps; witness their two losses to 
South Carolina. Luckily for them 
neither Utah nor Wake Forest falls 
into that category. Regardless of who 
wins a potential Wake-Utah game, 
the smart money will take the Wild
cats to reach the Final Four.
Final four prediction:
North Carolina, Kansas, Cincinnati, 
and Kentucky. Kansass sole loss this 
season was an overtime fluke. Look 
for them to play Kentucky in the fi
nals with Jacque Vaughn and the 
rest of his Jayhawk companions win
ning the final.
Long-shot upsets:
Miami of Ohio over Clemson, 
Princeton over California, Long Is
land University over Villanova, 
Temple over Minnesota in round two.
In this years tournament Pitts
burgh is hosting first and second 
round games in the East Region. The 
four first round games, to be played 
this Friday are: South Carolina vs. 
Coppin St., New Mexico vs Old Do
minion, Louisville vs Massachusetts, 
and Wisconsin vs. Texas.
Although all the games are already 
sold out, shoot-arounds for all the 
teams on Thursday, starting at noon, 
are free to the public.

computer engineering major. Hes 
very upset that Pittsburgh didnt 
make the field, even though he doesnt

the other city teams.

on the first shot of the second period, as
sisted by senior Relja Ivanovic and gradstudent Blair Echols. Minutes later, on the
from Fitzgerald and Maddalena. Then, Ardire 
finished his five-point night by sending a 
text-book pass, skipping to Maddalena in 
front for a goal, setting the final tally at 9-0. 
Ardire skated to the bench smiling. We could
power play, Paul and junior defenseman have gotten a few more in, the senior said.
Dave Mitzel returned the favor to Ivanovic. 
who flipped the puck in the net making the 
score 3-0 CMU. Then Ray Ardire went to 
work. Continuing his long-standing tradi
tion of scoring excellence, he scored back-toback goals; the first assisted by 
grad-student Captain Roger 
Maddalena, the second by 
Ivanovic. Ardire managed to pull 
three defenders on him at once 
and still clear the puck towards 
the net. CMUs play was fluid 
and strong.
In the third, the onslaught continued. Getting good defensive 
help from Echols and Mitzel, Maddalena 
and Ardire controlled the puck and threw it 
to junior forward Scott Fitzgerald, all alone 
down low. That play, said Fitzgerald, was 
assisted by everybody.
Forty seconds later, the second line charged 
out and freshman P.J. Grzywacz and Paul 
assisted Ivanovic on his second goal, which 
forced IUP into calling an emergency time
out. CMU was up 7-0. Nothing was stopping 
their steam roll over the young IUP squad.
The last two goals were on the power play. 
Ardire completed his hat-trick on a feed
The CMU squad was feeling good about 
soundly advancing to the semi-finals. 
They were to face Penn State Main, a 
team that since its entrance to the league 
three years ago has rarely lost a game.
This has been the best team Ive 
ever been privileged to be a part of. 
 Matt Williams 
senior hockey player
This season was no different. They were 
12-0 in their division coming into the 
playoffs and undefeated in every game 
they had played.
The team won their division games by an 
average score of 12-2 and outscored their 
opponents by an incredible 158 goals to 22. 
PSUs 158 goals during the regular season 
was over twice as many goals as any other 
team in the WPCHA East or West divi
sions. Their 22 goals allowed was also 
easily the least amount given up by any 
team in either division. By comparision, 
CMU scored 66 
goals and let by 35 
in their 12 divi
sional games. It 
was a daunting 
match-up. But 
PSU had never 
faced an under
dog, and Carnegie 
Mellon rose to the 
challenge.
The PSU semi-final game was the 
total opposite of the 
previous nights 
game. PSU scored 
early and often, 
shutting down 
CMUs first two 
lines and crushing 
the third. They 
were clean but 
large and solid. 
CMU was in it for 
the first period, 
only a few goals 
down. The lone 
tally came from

quick pass to Ivanovic who sent a strong 
straight shot towards PSU, scoring the only 
goal of the game for CMU.
The rest of then night was frustrating. 
CMU was mesmerized, but never gave up. 
I think we had good heart, and stayed with 
them as best as we could, Maddalena said. 
We never gave up and we were all up for 
the game. PSU skated around CMU play
ers, deluging Kliegman with 43 shots. CMU 
managed just ten, only the third time that 
they have been out-shot this 
season. Halfway through the 
third, Paul received a gamemisconduct and left the ice with 
fire. Ardire spent most of the 
remaining ten minutes in the 
box as well. How fitting that I 
end my career in the penalty 
box, the oft-penalized player 
said.
And it was the end of the game and the 
season, CMU lost 10-1. But there were few 
grim faces. The biggest regrets seemed to 
be that they didnt play fully-manned; the 
losses of seniors Chris Adukaitis and Jim 
Buck were deeply felt, especially by their 
fellow seniors.
We might have made a better run for the 
championship with two more strong players 
like Jim and Chris. We would have been 
more balanced and they would have pro
vided for a lot more offense.
Tonight, to lose a game 10-1 is tough, but 
it was even tougher on Chris and Buck, 
coach Fred Maddalena added. They had to 
watch from the bench instead of being able 
to do something.
This years team was one of the closest 
group of players Ive been around, said 
Adukaitis, who helped coach during the play
off weekend. They were also the most hard
working especially second semester. Im glad 
to have been able to play with Buck for the 
past four years, both on the ice and off. It 
was a disappointing way to end a career, 
though, for the both of us.
PSU continued on to beat IUP1 in the 
championship game on Sunday, 41. Pitt 
was forced to forfeit their Saturday night 
semi-final game against IUP1, for trying to 
play an ineligible player.
Team sentiments about the weekend and 
the season were high. The club loses eight 
key players to graduation this year: 
Kliegman, Ardire, Adukaitis, Buck, Ivanovic, 
Paul, Echols and Matt Williams.
This has been the best team Ive ever been 
privileged to be a part of, Williams com
mented. We were the best team we could be 
this season.
Carnegie Mellon ended their season with a 
12-10-1 record overall, ranked second in 
their WPCHA division. It is the hockey clubs 
seventh consecutive playoff appearance, a 
WPCHA record.

SEASON, from page 14 
playing in the NCAA Division III 
tournament, including three of the 
teams outside the conference that 
they played (Kenon, Savannah, and 
Frostburg) also made it to the tour
nament. CMU also suffered a lot of 
injuries, including one to fresh
man forward Kristy Thomas. We 
hadmany lineup adjustments with 
younger players. Kristy Thomas 
was a factor, said Seidl. The two 
bright spots of the team were 
Kristen Kupfer, who was named to 
the second team All-UAA and 
Penny Davis, who was named UAA 
honorable mention. Penny was
the glow of our team, said Seidl.
Seidl was quick to credit junior 
guard others. Marceile Steele did a 
great job, and it doesnt show in the 
numbers. She really came on for us 
not so much in stats, but in her 
moves and leadership, said Seidl.
There is a bright outlook for the 
future, as the Tartans expect to 
return ten freshman to next years 
squad. Their work will be cut out 
for them. We need some defen
sive work. We have some offen
sive strengths. Our challenge will 
be to strengthen our defense, 
said Seidl. The foundation is laid 
and we need to build upon that.
NIGHT, from page 14
as Jess Connelly had stressed 
was the importance of these 
games. Even the losing team 
joked around at the end of the 
game, claiming that the loss was 
indeed Ann Haggertys (their 
coach) fault, since she could not 
participate in the game.
The following game produced 
the most surprising upset in the 
IM tourney when Air Sig Ep (5- 
3) outplayed the Phi Kappa Theta 
Agongs (7-0). PKT was the heavy 
favorite, coming in with a perfect 
record and an impressive victory 
over SAE. Air Sig Ep, despite a 
less than perfect record, had made 
it to the final off the strength of 
surprising victories over last 
years semifinalists KSA Domin
ions and last years runner-up 
Kappa Sigma. This year the ques
tion would be how long could their 
Cinderella story last as they faced 
the defending Intermediate divi
sion champs.
Physically, the opposing teams 
proved to be a fair matchup, as 
neither side had a definite size 
advantage. A strong collapsing 
defense was the trademark of both 
teams for the first quarter as each 
side was held to a mere five points. 
At the end of the second quarter, 
PKT pulled ahead by a bucket, 
with Karim Muri scoring 11 of 
PKTs 12 first half points.
Sig Ep responded by coming 
out strong in the second half, with 
Val Fouron and Dave Co alter 
dominating the boards and Jeff 
Klock raining jumpshots from all 
corners of the floor. By the end of 
the third quarter, Sig Ep had 
retaken the lead by four. The
intense inside play of Coalter and 
Fouron increased the lead during 
the fourth quarter. A moment of 
uncertainty came for Sig Ep when 
they were called for a series of 
offensive fouls in which the tough 
Trent Morrow fouled out. But 
thanks to the solid juniper of Jeff 
Klocks, the game was put out of 
reach as Sig Ep went home with 
a shocking 40-30 victory over the 
reigning champions. They 
outplayed us at the end, either 
team couldve won, said PKTs 
Dave Dybes. Both teams were 
indeed equally matched. 
Somethings just worked out that 
way for us, Trent Morrow agreed. 
Phi Kap are a really good team 
and are good sports.
Klock, the game MVP with 18 
points, also mentioned that an
other key factor, alongside the 
strong rebounding of Fouron^rid 
Coalter, was the great physical 
shape of Phil OHara and Trent 
allowing crucial fuilcourt pres
sure throughout the game. Origi
nally seeded last in the division, 
Air Sig Ep earned their bragging 
rights as champions with the 
heart and hustle to overcome their 
mediocre 4-3 start.
The final attraction of the night 
brought out many of Carnegie 
Mellons fans as over 100 specta
tors arrived to cheer on this great 
matchup between the shirtless 
Beta team and Theta Xi Liquid. 
As last years Majors champs, 
Beta was favored to win. How
ever, the large size of both teams 
created no obvious advantage on 
the physical level. In the first 
quarter, Theta Xis Calvin Har
ris created numerous slashing
drives to edge Liquid to a 2312 
lead. Liquids Brian Christopher 
contributed with a pair of bombs 
from downtown. The second quar
ter was also dominated by Theta 
Xi, with Mat Morton crashing the 
boards and serving up several 
emphatic rejections. With blow
out seemingly eminent, the Be
tas regrouped after half-time and 
scored 14 unanswered points. 
Betas Omar Antigua lead this 
turnaround with spectacular 
drives, including a delicate tipin. Only a pair of Sergio Mendezs 
free throws late in the quarter 
kept Theta Xi from a scoreless 
period. A key turning point in the 
fourth quarter came as Betas 
center, Brad McNutt, was ejected 
after receiving his second techni
cal foul for constant abusive lan
guage to the officials.
Without their big man, Beta 
was unable to stop Theta Xis 
guards from penetrating deep into 
the paint. With excellent plays 
captained by Harris, Theta Xi 
held on to their lead despite 
missed free throws by Harris, 
Morton, Dan Krawczyk, and 
(much to the crowds disappoint
ment) a botched dunk attempt by 
Harris. A late comeback staged 
by the Betas ending with a Todd 
Fedak drive brought them back 
within one inside the two-minute 
mark, but Theta Xi escaped with 
a 46-42 victory. After the game 
MVP Harris, ending with 15 
points, commented that he had 
fun playing this season. Having 
fun is what is most important of 
all. Though it doesnt hurt to be 
champions, which Theta Xi de
serves to be.

Bloods (7-1) and the team of Gang 
Green (8-0) in the Minors champi
onship. Despite a mostly under
sized Gang Green Team, thengreat teamwork and the steady 
shot of Anthony Enos overwhelmed 
the more physical Beta opponents.
They were the toughest team 
weve played, theyre so big and 
can all shoot, said Enos, the 
games MVP. Both teams played 
an intense defense, attributed to 
their physical playing style. In 
fact, the defense on both sides 
was so fierce, the teams were held 
to a 13-12 score at the end of the 
third quarter, with Beta clinging 
to their lead. Gang Green finally 
broke it open in the fourth quarter, 
sparked by Enos, scoring 17 of his 
teams 24 points. Clutch foul shots 
help Gang Green remain ahead 
with only minutes left. Along with
single point. This time, the 
Hoopers once again proved to be 
too much for the diminished 
H.O.S. team. Ignited by Jess 
Connelly, the Hoopers sprinted 
out to a 9-0 lead in the first 
quarter and never looked back. 
H.O.S. was held to only two points 
in the entire first half with their 
own brand of physical defense. 
H.O.S.s Mae Hogan began to 
bring it together in the later half 
of the game scoring eight of the 
teams ten points. But the con
sistent low post play of Jess 
Curtis for the Hoopers finally 
brought the championship to the 
Hoopers with their 31-10 win. 
Both Curtis (12 points) and 
Connelly (six points) were named 
Co-MVPs of the games. Both 
teams had fan and played well,

Women close out hoops season
By KEVIN KROEN
Tartan Staffwriter
The CMU womens basketball team 
ended its season on a mixed note with 
a blowout win against Chatham Col
lege 81-30 and a tough loss against 
the University of Rochester 74-58.
In the Chatham game, the womens 
team set a school record by hitting 
nine three-pointers. Seven different 
people hit threes, including three treys 
by senior guard Kelly Gaitens. It was 
exciting. It was nice to come out and 
score like that, said coach Gerri Seidl.
There were also other impressive 
accomplishments in this game. CMU 
held Chathams team to a 16.7 field 
goal percentage and outrebounded 
them by almost a two-to-one ratio. 
Their defense also caused 21 steals 
and created 29 turnovers. CMU did all 
of this while playing 16 players, many 
of whom had not seen any time this
year. We had some kids who practiced 
all year and never played. It was nice for 
them to contribute, said Seidl.
Leading the way for the Tartans were 
senior forward Kristen Kupfer with 14 
points and junior forward Katie OLeary 
with 12 points.
OLeary also led the team with nine 
rebounds, while senior forward Rebecca 
McCadeny had seven boards and fresh
man center Kara Coval added six. Coach 
Seidl ensured that her team would not 
play down to Chathams level. We were 
relaxed. We just played. We stayed at 
our level, said Seidl.
The Tartans did not have the same 
luck with the University of Rochester as 
they did with Chatham. Leading the 
way for the Tartans in this game were 
Gaitens with 13 points, Kupfer with 11, 
and OLeary with nine points. OLeary 
also led the team in rebounds with 11 
boards, while Gaitens grabbed five. The 
Tartans were only down by five at the
half, 34-29, but let the game run away 
in the second half.
We started out well. We were play
ing well. We didnt capitalize on their 
mistakes. We had an opportunity to 
put them away and we didnt do it. 
said Seidl. The first half was a bright 
spot for the Tartans. We were playing 
pretty well in the first half. We had 
less turnovers. We were getting good 
shots and our press was effective, 
said Seidl. CMUs biggest problem in 
the second half seemed to be getting 
the ball in the basket. What really 
hurt was the 21 field goal percentage 
in the second half, said Seidl.
The Tartans were also rebounded on 
both ends by almost a two to one ratio. 
Coach Seidl had a positive outlook on 
the Tartans season despite finishing 
with a 10-15 record. People dont 
realize our tough schedule, said Seidl.

The mens and womens tennis teams con
tinued their undefeated spring seasons by 
defeating Oberlin and Nazareth Friday at the 
University of Pittsburghs Cost Center. The 
men increased their overall record to 8-1 and 
the women to 5-3.
Up first were the men who defeated Oberlin 
and then Nazareth 5-2. The women dealt 
Oberlin a 5-4 defeat through a tie-breaker 
match, but did not allow Nazareth to get close 
as they won 7-2. The teams were Ld to victory 
by their strong doubles ^lay. Out of a total of 
six matches each, the teams only dropped one 
set each to their opponents.
Were playing good doubles and thats how 
you win matches, head coach Beleii^osseaid.
The Womens team stancrout, nationally 
ranked Keri Mills was undefeated in both 
doubles play as well as singles. Her team
mate, senior Michelle Cook also defeated all 
opponents she faced. For the Mens team, 
senior Iroro Orife also shared that distinction.
Mens captain Navroze Marshall also 
stressed the importance of doubles wins. Its 
a pretty crucial part, said Marshall. It gets 
the team off to a good start if you win. All 
agree that the toughest competition will come
at Hilton Head over spring break. It should be 
really tough and really crucial, said Marshall.
Hilton Head will have our toughest compe
tition. [These wins] give us more confidence 
going in, said sophomore Jillian Watkins. The 
teams have performed especially well against 
tough competition.
Weve been able to win against teams weve 
lost to, like Nazareth, said Moss.
The season so far has been successful and the 
outlook is very good for the remainder. It looks 
goM so far, and I hope we can keep it going, 
said Marshall.

Mosaic tackles women's issues
Cracking the 
image myth
By RHONDA GILLESPIE
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
At a time when many people would be willing to 
sacrifice more than three years of their lives for 
a better body  according to a February 1997 
Psychology Monthly poll  author and psy
chologist Nancy Hawley is busy dispelling the 
myth that thinness naturally gives rise to hap
piness. Instead, the co-author of the 
groundbreaking book Our Bodies, Our Selves 
is crossing the country teaching young men 
and women to be confident, happy, and accept
ing of who they are.
Last Sunday, Hawley brought her message to 
the First Annual Mosaic Womens Conference at 
Carnegie Mellon, as the events keynote speaker.
According to Hawley, people need to become 
more comfortable with their bodies and accept who 
they are and what they look like because appear
ance could be the result of forces over which they 
have no control.
By denying genetics and striving to achieve a certain 
body type, we deny our bodies. We turn to obsessive behav
iors, Hawley said.
She took all of the things that I worry about and combined 
them into the topic of body image. It makes you think about the 
clothes you wear and why, said Kelly McPhee, a sophomore psycholgy major.
Upon Hawleys request, the audience of approximately 90 people closed 
their eyes, as Hawley asked them to envision different things pertaining to body 
image. Imagine yourself standing in front of a mirror.... Have a look at your body....
What do you like in what you see? Hawley asked the audience to look at themselves 
through .their inner eyes, and take note of how they see themselves, how others may
see them, how they take care of them
selves, and how the inevitable changes 
that occur- in their bodies over time 
affect them.
Girls talk about [body image] all the 
time. Its nice to hear that other people 
feel that way too. Its nice to take an 
objective look at yourself, said Anne 
Clark, a sophomore communications de
sign major.
In a place where 
women are the mi
nority, it is essential 
that there be a vis
ible community 
where women can
find and express their own voices and 
listen to the voices of other women,
Hawley said. She explained that it is 
important for women to be in contact with 
other women who have had an impact on 
their lives. Women need to stand up and 
support each other in classrooms, to make 
sure that their voices and the voices of 
other women are not dismissed or ignored by other people.
Hawley encouraged young people to be assertive and 
to choose friends well. According to her, college stuMslo,l ,ll 8tIU3 Robl 0p
Participating 
in academics
By CARRIE JONES-McGUIRE
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Dont be afraid to take control back.
This statement by Dr. Susan Ambrose, adjunct his
tory professor and director of CMUs Embry Center for 
Teaching Excellence (ECFTE), expresses the essence 
of Being Heard and Taken Seriously in the College 
Classroom, the lecture she presented at the First 
Annual Mosaic Womens Conference last Sunday.
The issue of womens voice in the classroom is very 
important to Ambrose. As director of ECFTE, she 
sits in on many classes across campus to observe 
things women do that potentially hinder being taken 
seriously in class, as well as behaviors of others that 
might hinder womens participation.
In her own experience, she has had difficulty 
speaking up and being heard in classroom settings. 
She spoke of a speech that she gave at MIT. It was 
the first time I had spoken to such a distinguished 
group, and I was terrified, Ambrose said. But I gave 
a presentation that I thought, frankly, was brilliant. 
When I called for questions or comments, though, the 
first one I got was, I hope you dont take this the wrong 
way, but you have a beautiful smile. And I just thought, did 
you hear anything I said?
When certain groups make statements which call inappropriate 
attention to womens physical attributes, it signals that they dont take 
women seriously, according to Ambrose. Other actions include interrupting 
a woman while she is speaking more so than when the speaker is a man, taking

Women have a lot to offer, particularly the 
smart women of CMU.

adjunct history professor
credit for things women have said, patronizing or stereotyping women, and viewing 
women harshly if they break stereotypes.
Ambrose believes that it is important for women to point out such 
disturbing behaviors in a non-threatening way. A lot of the time, many of 
the male faculty members are not aware that they call men by name, but 
not women, and they call on men more than women, Ambrose said. I,

Career fields open for women

At CMU, a non-traditional ca

belief in society that women are not 
as capable as men at certain 
discliplines, particularly in the sci

first annual con

addressed this is. sue in the lecture 
Women in Non- ^
Traditional Disciplines. Carrie B.
Doonan, a lecturer in biology, and 
Sue McNeil, a civil and environ
mental engineering professor, 
spoke about the societal and pro
fessional hurdles involved in being 
a woman in a non-traditional field.
According to Doonan and McNeil, 
one of the major roadblocks that 
women face that their male coun
terparts do not is an underlying

have a more difficult time proving 
their work to be correct.
The perception in society of 
womens lesser abilities may also lead 
to bias dming interviews. To counter 
this, Doonan suggested that stu
dents, volunteer, take that class you 
always wanted to, take every oppor
tunity that you can... She also ad
vised those at the lecture to be 
agressive, assertive, and innovative.
The professors showed by example 
that it is possible to succeed in tradi
tionally male-dominated professions. 
Although Doonan showed statistics 
that indicated that more women than 
men were currently majoring in biol
ogy and chemistry, these statistics 
also revealed that the ratio of men to 
women in fields such as engineering, 
math, and physics was 
still disproportionately 
high.
McNeil shared her 
own experiences to il
lustrate this point. She 
was the only female in 
a class of men at one 
point during college, 
and after graduating, - ... j was piace(j in 
charge of a construction team made 
up entirely of males. Despite the lack 
of women, she managed to thrive in 
these environments. My boss would 
tellme to call people for him, and said, 
Tou can get stuff done! 
One important aspect of non-traditional careers is the balance between 
family and career. This subject was

By REENA SINGHAL

Regardless of the walls people put up in 
front of you, you can always break them down 
through perseverance, or at least find ways to 
get around them, said Lisa Sigel, an adjunct 
professor in the History Department and 
representative of Humanities and Social Sci
ences on the Role Models board. This was just 
one piece of advice presented last Sunday by 
the six faculty who comprised the Role Model 
Board at Mosaic, the first womens confer
ence at CMU.
These female CMU faculty members dis
cussed their experiences and how they ar
rived in their current positions by overcom
ing various obstacles and dealing with issues 
as women.
[The panel] gives women a sense of what 
other women have done, said Karen Stump,
principal lecturer and director of laborato
ries in the chemistry department, who 
represented the Mellon College of Science.
One of the biggest obstacles women face, 
according to the panelists, is being a vic
tim of various assumptions. According to 
Stump, when working in a male-dominated environment, people make assump
tions about the role a woman is going to 
play and how a woman is going to act in 
certain situations, even when the situa
tions are not gender-related.
If you are a woman, you are assumed to 
be a feminist, said Faith Wilding, profes
sor in the Art Department and representa
tive of the College of Fine Arts on the 
Board. [YouJ have to be prepared to have 
stereotyping and controversy.

Facing Race and Culture
Though 19 percent of CMUs student body is 
international  nine percent of undergrads, 31 
percent of Masters students, and an incredible 51 
percent of PhD candidates  there is surprisingly 
little focus on global experience, perspective, and 
culture. Most of us recognize the strong interna

consider that these students must juggle the inten

Villavicencio, a masters student at the Informa
tion Networking Institute, who is from Venezuela. 
All the things that are apparently normal here 
[such as] adding and dropping courses, selecting 
electives aggressively, choosing thesis advisors, 
looking for job opportunities, etc, are not usually 
the same way in many other countries, like mine.

Scholarship winnerplans trip to China
By SUSEE CRffiBS

Cindy Yangs combination of energy, 
interest, and enthusiasm have won 
her the opportunity to study abroad in 
the Yunnan province of China this 
summer. Yang, a civil and environ
mental engineering major with a mi
nor in architecture, is the recipient of 
this years Vira I. Heinz award, a studyabroad scholarship established for tal
ented young women in 1956. It was 
important to Heinz that women have 
the opportunity to study in an interna
tional setting if they so chose. After 41 
years, the Vira I. Heinz Study Travel 
Award remains an important option 
for women in their junior year at CMU 
as well as at ten other universities 
within Pennsylvania and West Vir
ginia who are interested in studying 
abroad.
The program and project fit into 
[Yangs] long-term goals and built on 
her previous work and interests. It 
was a combination of a difficult sum
mer program with an independent 
quest, said Eva Mergner, study abroad
advisor in the Office of International 
Education.
The difficult program is Yangs visit 
to the Yunnan province of China to 
participate in a trip sponsored by the 
Architecture Department. While re
siding at Yunnan Polytechnic Univer

study Chinese architecture under the 
direction of professors Omer Akin and

will be used to pay for such expenses 
as airfare, tuition for the program,

Education takes more than training
The Players Manual
by Amit N. Kar
Fifty years ago, Robert Oppenheimer 
was watching the first nuclear mush
room cloud rise over a flat expanse of 
Nevada desert. After having spent the 
better part of the previous two years 
trying to make this happen  to do the 
impossibleone would think he would 
have been overcome with joy at his 
achievement. Perhaps, were this a con
temporary scene, he would have 
punched the air with his fist, turned to 
the nearest person, and said, Whos 
the mack-daddy?! Whos the mackdaddy!? Fuck, yeah! But Oppenheimer 
was far too educated a man to take 
such a narrow view of the event and all 
its implications. Instead of reveling, 
he looked down to the ground and 
muttered a phrase from the Bhagavad 
Gita, the holy book of Hinduism, writ
ten in Sanskrit: I am become Death; 
destroyer of worlds.
As if being one of the eminent physi
cists of his time wasnt enough, the man 
dressed sharp, had a firm grip on real
ity, and read Sanskrit literature. But 
Oppenheimer lived at a time when higher 
education was really about education 
and not about training like it is today.
Ive been appalled, in recent months, 
to see CMU students yell insults at their 
professors in lecture, display an amaz
ing lack of basic manners, profess a 
contemptuous disregard for people with 
lesser training, and demonstrate fright
ening short-sightedness and lack of gen
eral knowledge. Students here receive 
first-rate training in their chosen fields, 
but they sure as hell arent being edu
cated. This is scary because, with the 
exception of opposable thumbs, the one 
thing separating us from animals is edu
cation. You educate humans; you train 
monkeys, dogs, and rats. Samuel 
Langhorne Clemens was, perhaps, a 
little ahead of his time when he said, I 
have never let my schooling get in the 
way of my education.
Too many CMU students take the at
titude of this is the game, this is how its 
played and I need to take this approach 
to do well. Critical thought takes a back 
seat to the algorithmic approach exem
plified by the institution. The result is a 
graduate who gets a good job and is an 
expert in his/her field, but who doesnt
say thanks when a door is held open, is 
uninterested or incapable of interacting 
with people who are too different, and 
has a limited vision of the consequences 
of his/her actions  basically a well-- 
paid monkey or rat.
The emphasis on training is partly a 
function of the greater amount of spe
cific knowledge one must learn about a 
field; todays physicist must learn, in a 
few years, all the physics Oppenheimer 
knew in his lifetime. While this has 
helped the exponential progress of tech
nology, it has also contributed to the 
stratification of society. We expend so 
much time and effort in our training 
that we forget to learn about our pasts, 
other people, other languages, other 
schools of thought, other art, other sports, 
other behavior, etc. Worst of all, we 
come to look at other bodies of knowl
edge as just another thing I dont need 
to know. Well buddy, the truth is you 
dont need to know anything. But when 
you choose to take that mentality, you 
simply build another barrier between 
yourself and other people. When sup
posedly intelligent humans like 
Theodore Kaczynskiyou know him as 
the Unabomber  wake up one day to 
find theyve isolated themselves, they 
react violently.
A truly educated person knows the

that often haunts 
women who seek jobs in 
non-traditonal fields. Al
though both women 
stressed that one must 
make trade-offs in both 
family and career, they 
cited an overall balance 
in life as the most im
portant.
Doonan was once 
told that she would 
regret giving up a 
promising position in 
order to start a fam
ily. I think I was 
meant to teach, said 
Doonan, who added 
that she would not 
have found teaching 
had she not taken time 
out for her family.
Most helpful [in the 
lecture] was the idea of 
family and career, in
stead of family versus 
career, said Margot 
Bloomstein, a freshman 
design major.
The experiences of 
the speakers helped to 
explain the fears that most women have in non-traditional fields.It 
was interesting to hear personal experiences of balancing a family and 
profession.... Its good to know that its not like all the horror stories,

tween life at home and a career. Ob
stacles [women face] often end up being 
internal, said Stump. It is a struggle 
between priorities.... My children are 
familiar faces on campus. They have a 
good idea of what I do, said Stump. It 
is important to make them feel like they 
are a part of what I do.
According to Claudia Kirkpatrick, 
administrative director of the Indus
trial Management Department and 
representative of the School of Indus
trial Administration on the Board, a 
woman does not always need to find a 
balance but instead find other ways to 
deal with the imbalances in life. What 
makes it all possible is that one is not 
doing it only for a salary, but because 
it is satisfying. [It] is important to 
choose what you do with your time, 
said Kirkpatrick.
According to Wilding, women gener
ally occupy lower ranks in the teaching 
profession, such as assistant and ad
junct professors. Women are the last 
ones hired... and occupy the untenured 
ranks.
Kirkpatrick added that most senior 
faculty members are white and male, 
and that employers or promoters tend 
to choose males who possess 85 per
cent of the characteristics they are 
looking for. However, with women, 
there is a lack of trust, and employers 
and promoters look for a woman who 
has 100 percent of the qualities they 
are looking for.
The panel also offered advice on how 
to look for jobs and pursue higher de
grees. According to Susan Finger, an

and pay attention to the way other people 
work. [You need to] see if thats compat
ible to the way you work, said Finger.
Sigel suggested that female students 
find out whether certain jobs hire 
women equally and that they apply to 
schools where there is a low or equal 
attrition rate. She added that females 
need to make sure that they are funded 
or compensated the same as male col
leagues.
[You need] to be thoughtful about

tative of the School of Computer Sci
ence, said, You often find that it is 
inconvenient to be a woman, and often it 
will mean that you have to work harder, 
but it is not necessarily a bad thing. It 
helps you grow as a person. 
Kirkpatrick said, You can do what 
you want to do. Being a woman is no 
more of a problem that what you make it 
to be. You have to have faith in yourself 
and your own abilities.
associate professor in civil and environ

tant to look at both the people and the

think about who you are going to be with
what it means to be a woman in a par
ticular field, said Stump. [You] dont 
want to get into a negative attitude and 
blame things on the fact that you are a 
woman. [You] need to recognize who you 
are and where you want to be.

dents to consult with the ICC [Intercultural Communication

Shulte, a Ph.D. student in philosophy from Germany.
Linda Melville, foreign student advisor for the OIE, 
said, I am the only foreign student advisor for 1,300 
students, when the recommended number is one advisor 
for every 300 students.
Melville added, In some ways the school is incredibly sup
portive of international students, but in other ways it could do 
a lot better. The school could have some sort of international 
component in the curriculum for undergraduate students, 
though obviously not a lot. [The school could also] increase 
programming for international students, work to unify the 
separate departments that are already working together inter
nationally, and increase academic support for study abroad.... 
We need to celebrate diversity more. We have so many interest
ing people at CMU  we need some kind of recognition that 
were international.

Scott Fried, an actor and 
author living with the HIV 
virus, recounted this story 
from a religious camp in 
New England he was a part 
of last summer .
Fried, who contracted 
the HIV virus in the 80s 
has been traveling 
around the country for 
several years now, try
ing to convey a mes
sage about the disease 
that is different from 
any supplied by the 
media or schools.
So thats how I

part of the opening to 
his evening talk on 
Wednesday, February 
26, at the William Pitt Union 
in Oakland. By telling you 
that I really dont know 
much.... Im really here as 
one of you.
Fried created a tone of 
equality, which he tries to 
achieve in all of his talks
and which defines his own 
outlook on the subject of AIDS 
and HIV.
There is a blessing here and 
its already started.... Look at 
all the people here tonight.
, Thats a blessing. 
f Were here, and to
gether well find a 
way out of here  
together. We are 
all people living 
with AIDS, said 
Fried.
Most teachers in 
this country dont 
teach their kids 
[about AIDS]. Stu
dents are not retain
ing the informaSafe sex is not just wearing 
a condom, or using other safe 
things. Safer sex before that, 
during that, and after that is 
feeling safe, said Fried. The 
way to a dangerous encounter 
starts with what you bring into 
it. If you bring to it your abil
ity to recognize your needs and 
to say what you want, youre 
already having safe sex.
Fried also read an excerpt 
from his soon-to-be-released 
book, which described how he 
contracted HIV and empha
sized his own emotional reac
tions to the mistakes he made.
He spoke about the pain of 
losing 126 friends to the disreligion and family, said 
Fried.
Fried also brought to light a 
new perspective on the real risk; 
of contracting the virus. AIDS 
in our society is a manifesta
tion of something even bigger. 
Its a lack of self-respect, alack 
of self-love.... If you dont care 
enough about yourselves, thats 
the biggest risk group to be in
 thats the only risk group 
there is, he said.
All you have to do is care 
about yourselves. There is a 
light at the end of this tunnel.

about the spiritual, motiva
tional, and emotional side of 
the disease.
with his parents reactions, 
and of finding out he was HIVpositive on June 1, 1988  A 
day Ill never forget, ever,

When I heard the word 
AIDS, what I think of is the 
word love. Theres more to 
AIDS than sadness. There is 
also hope, there is also life, 
there is also compassion and
stand up here and know that 
you wish me well.... I have 
to bear witness to my story, 
and I must tell it so it doesnt 
happen again.
The point of life is just to 
live with what youve been

a smile and a shrug of his 
shoulders. Im here, Im still 
alive, and life is not so bad.
Debate continues over disclosure of Presidents leisure time
WASHINGTON (AP), March 6  Americans 
and the world know an awful lot about how 
President Clinton spends his time. From morn
ing exercises to evening outings, people can read 
all about it.
Well, not quite. Some of Clintons activities may 
not become known for months or years to come  
if at all. The extent of the White House coffee 
klatsches that Clinton held with hundreds of Demo
cratic donors and the legions of overnight guests he 
entertained before the 1996 elections didnt be
come common knowledge untilmonths later, with 
details still trickling out now.
Cintons periodic meetings with U.S. central bank 
Chairman Alan Greenspan go undisclosed to re
porters encamped just yards away in a White 
House press room. Reporters were in the dark 
when former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger 
brought a group of outside experts to the White 
House to discuss China policy with Clinton.
It was ever thus. Presidents reveal what they 
choose to  or are forced to.
The world thought Franklin Roosevelt was fish
ing off the coast of Cape Cod in August 1941 when 
he held a secret wartime rendezvous with Winston 
Churchill off Newfoundland.
President Bush invited Richard Nixon to visit 
him in the White House, and reporters stationed
full-time in the building had no idea.
Lyndon Johnson secreted Thurgood Marshall 
into the White House through a tunnel to ensure 
his Supreme Court nomination would come as a 
surprise.
Its very common that some big story will emerge 
very much later, after an event occurs, because we 
in the press corps dont really know what the 
president is up to, said Ken Walsh, a White House 
reporter for U.S. News and World Report who has 
written a book about press coverage of presidents.
With Clinton, some days his time is accounted for 
from morning jog to midnight policy meeting. On 
other days, there are big gaps. There can be large 
blocks of what aides describe as phone and office 
time or vague descriptions of meetings with sup
porters or the like.
In addition, reporters are confined to a small 
section of the White House except when escorted to 
specific events, making it harder for them to keep 
tabs on whos coming and going.
White House press secretary Mike McCurry de
fends the idea that some things should be kept 
secret. Timely word of Greenspans visits with 
Clinton, for example, could needlessly roil finan
cial markets, he said.
Marlin Fitzwater, White House press secretary 
to presidents George Bush and Ronald Reagan,
estimates that about 75 percent of a presidents 
time can be publicly accounted for. Thats plenty, 
in his view.
The president has to have some ability to meet 
with people privately, Fitzwater said, citing mat
ters such as delicate diplomatic negotiations and 
meetings with opposition leaders who might be 
embarrassed if word got out.
Historians tend to agree, although they like to pore 
through presidential papers after the fact to recon
struct the fullest possible record of a presidency.
In just 12 years,
The idea is, hes supposed to run the country 
well, not necessarily that every bob and weave 
is documented at the time it takes place, said 
John Mueller, a historian at the University of 
Rochester.
But they also see the potential for abuse. Any 
time the capacity for secrecy exists, it can be used 
for good or ill, said Cal McKenzie, a history 
professor at Colby College in Maine. President 
Kennedys liaisons with women are one example 
frequently cited.

Nancy Hawley, key note speaker at the Mosaic conference, addresses a question about the Importance of body image.
vision  and will start to examine 
how stressful compulsive behaviors 
are.
We all need guidance, help and sup
port. ...Be truthful that you have wants 
and needs in life. Dont be apologetic, 
she said.
I came to see Nancy Hawley 
speak because I felt concerned but 
generally unaware of the things 
women face, and I lacked specific 
knowledge, said Nathan 
Steinwald, a freshman in CIT. I 
enjoyed the speech. I thought it 
was well-tailored so that it wasnt 
specific just to women, but it was
have gone before.
Hawley is part of the Boston Womens 
Health Collective that authored Our 
Bodies, Our Selves, which has been both 
textbook and bible to more than two 
generations of women.
She said that when the group formed, 
it was not for the purpose of writing the 
book, but rather to assemWe a group of 
women with common problems and 
goals. The book arose out of their shared 
experiences and the knowledge that 
women everywhere were having the 
same experiences and problems, includ
ing the issue of choice and the misogy
nist nature of the health care system,
The prospect that this is happen
ing at CMU, and that Mosaic could 
be a yearly event excites Hawley. 
She hopes that her talks can get 
people to reexamine their lives and 
their views of themselves in order 
to help them lead a more satisfy
ing adult life.
Its a challenge to keep con
nected to other women in a com
munity when youre in the minor
ity, Hawley said. She encourages 
the women at CMU to keep con
nected, to be responsible, to make 
their own decisions, and to get 
their voices heard.
Female students must 
speak up in academics
SILENCE, from page LI
that you interrupted her, or discounted her? 
She pointed out that it is often helpful if someone else-vocaliz^s the offending 
behavior. In the example of the man who made the inappropriate comment to her 
at MIT, another man said that he thought the mans comment was uncalled for. 
Sometimes it seems awkward to jump in for oneself; its easier to do it for someone 
else. I think of it as a kind of buddy system. I find that sometimes we need time to 
regain our composure, and having someone else intervene gives time for that, 
Ambrose said.
But it isnt just others who inhibit women in the classroom. According to 
Ambrose, women can undermine themselves in a classroom situation by saying 
things such as Im not sure if this is right at the begining of a statement, using 
tag questions which involve giving an answer and then asking if its right, speaking 
with inflections that go up at the end of statements, and adding excessive qualifiers
If you have someone you can look to for af
firmation, that's very important... You need 
that feedback.
 Dr. Susan Ambrose, 
adjunct history professor
such as I think or Maybe it might be.
To combat these behaviors, Ambrose recommends having a friend in the 
class who can help. If you have someone you can look to for affirmation, thats, 
very important.... You need that feedback, or you end up wondering if you. 
sounded okay.
Another approach is to behave as though youre more confident. If you express 
yourself confidently, then you start to break those stereotypes, and theyll start to 
see you differently, Ambrose said.
Ambrose made her audience think about how they could change their behavior 
to be more appropriate.
The talk made me aware of what to look for in myself, and think about how I 
treat women in the classroom, said Mike Batz, a senior engineering and public 
policy and electrical and computer engineering double major.
She was really motivational, said Lizzi Miller, an undeclared fresh
man in humanities and social sciences. I feel that I have to be more 
assertive, not being afraid to ask a question, to say, That is not how 
youre supposed to treat me. 
Being heard in the classroom is one of Ambroses current research 
interests, which also include the experience of women in non-traditional, 
fields like engineering and the hard sciences, and the transition from 
graduate student to faculty member in these fields. She is the co-author 
of an upcoming book profiling 88 women in science and engineering, and 
the recipient, along with Cliff Davidson, of a five-year National Science 
Foundation grant to run a program aimed at helping to ease the transition 
for graduate students, especially women and minorities, becoming faculty 
in science and engineering.
These are not just womens issues. They affect everyone. When we 
alienate women from certain fields, we are alienating smart, talented, 
people, Ambrose said. Women have a lot to offer, particularly the smart 
women of CMU.

So theres these three brothers, a doctor, a 
dentist, and a lawyer, and theyve got this 
father whos on his deathbed (awww ... poor 
imaginary old man in the comics story).
So the father makes his three sons promise 
him one thing. Sons, he said, when I pass 
away, promise me youll do one thing.
Anything," his sons say.
I dont know what waits for me on the other 
side, so when I die, I want each of you to leave 
$2000 in my casket before they put me six feet 
under. 
So after the fathers fateful demise, the 
doctor entered the funeral home and placed 
$2000 in cash in his fathers fist, kissed him 
on the forehead, and left weeping.
Afterward, the dentist followed suit, 
performing the same ritual.
Lastly, the lawyer entered the home, placed a 
check for $6000 in his fathers grasp, took the 
$4000 cash, and said, Dont worry, it wont 
bounce.

Now that we live in a world where 
they (oh no, not them again) can 
clone a mammal at will, Comics

were two of you or two of me? Good? 
Bad? Groovy? Fun? Scary?
Well, if this is the case, then we 
better consider just whom (or what) 
we clone. Comics Guy gives you 
some duos to ponder. Sweet

Kresge lets its Hair down with musical
By SCOTT SHELL
Tartan Staffwriter
Thirty years ago, a small group of 
hippies shocked Broadway, reinvented 
the musical, and fashioned a profound 
political, statement about Vietnam. 
Hair, often dubbed the original rock 
musical, was a runaway hit. Writers 
Qerome Ragni and James Rado 
preached universal love and accep
tance and recognition of the human 
iik everyone. Performing the leads 
themselves, they were accompanied 
by Galt MacDermots innovative and 
instantly popular music. Hair, with 
its scandalous nudity and language, 
became the icon of the sixties.
Its now three decades later  
socially, thats ages. Vietnam is over. 
The flower children are no longer chil
dren. So where does this musical fit 
iiji? Carnegie Mellons own Drama De
partment seems to have the answer. 
CjMU Drama will perform Hair at the 
Kresge Theater. And the performance 
promises to bring as much excitement 
and meaning as the original.
The show is directed and choreo
graphed by Edie Cowan, who has 
worked on Annie, the original offEjroadway production of Little Shop of 
H^orrors, and a recent performance of 
TJie Big River in Pittsburgh. Still, she 
skid, Ive had to direct differently 
than I normally do.
i Cowan has tried to bring authentic
ity and clarity to the show, to make it 
as emotionally flavorful as it was 30 
years ago. If you just think of Hair 
a|s stoned-out hippies dancing 
abound, thats not what the shows 
about, she says. People saw the 
hippies as anti-patriotic, but it was 
quite the opposite. They were pas
sionate for their country.
Cowan is after this passion. To 
capture the writers original inten
tions, she and the cast thoroughly 
researched the issues that affected 
the period. Then, she staged it in an 
uncommon way. She told us to act 
out what came naturally, and we 
would work from there, said Marcus 
Chait, senior drama 
major and Berger 
in the show. Cowan 
notes that the per
formers are crucial 
in capturing the 
spontaneous aspect 
of the show: The 
casts creativeness 
and inventiveness is 
wonderful.
The result will be 
a very relevant per
formance of Hair.
Cowan and the cast 
emphasize the 
musicals signifi
cance and roles. Its a 
historical documen
tary that acknowl
edges and applauds 
hippie ideals. Its a 
period piece that 
presents extant 
themes: war, racism, 
feminism, equality, 
and freedom, among 
others. Its central 
message  that all 
humans are essen
tially the same and 
should be loved and 
celebrated  is ex
tremely pertinent.
Theyre managing all 
of this while main
taining a highly en
tertaining musical
comedy. Chait says, Itll make you 
laugh at your own prejudices and inhi
bitions.
What should you expect? Other than 
a stellar performance, the consensus is, 
Dont expect anythingjust come see 
it, said Cowan. She notes that the 
musical caters to all types of viewers,
courtesy of University Relations 
Performers in Hair adopt the hippie style for their roles.
from those looking for energy and 
entertainment to those who esteem 
its values. This has a message if you 
want it, she says.
Cowan and the cast want Hair to 
absorb its audience in the process. 
Though theyre not out to recruit hip
pies as the writers were, they want to 
achieve the same intimacy. 
We want [the audience] to 
be a part of the-tribe, to live 
through the characters, 
says Chait. Patrons are 
even encouraged to dress 
the part, and the three bestdressed hippies will win a 
subscription to Dramas 
97-98 season.
So heres a fantastic op
portunity. Its a chance to 
be thoroughly entertained, 
to experience history and 
humanity, even to learn 
about your parents, as per
former and sophomore 
drama major Tomar Wil
son says. Its a chance to be 
part of a show that extends 
its family and love to the 
audience. And with the cast 
and crews vitality and tal
ent, as well as a marvelous 
director, it looks like it wont 
be anything less than out
right groovy.
Hair will run from March 
14 until April 5 at the Kresge 
Theatre in the College of 
Fine Arts. There will be a 
benefit performance on 
Monday, March 17 at 8 pm 
with discounted tickets to

Students still
By RYAN DONOVAN
Tartan Assistant Diversions Editor
In the seventies, there was less 
policing and more individual choice. 
Now it seems paranoid; everyones 
afraid for their health, or of getting 
sued. The seventies was all about more 
individual spirit, said Sharon 
Dilworth, associate professor of En
glish and veteran of the seventies. If 
youve got any sense of pop culture, 
youll realize that Dilworth isnt the 
only one wanting to go back to the 
seventies. Musicians, teenagers too 
young to have lived in that golden 
decade, and the entire fashion indus
try all seem to want life to revert back 
t those easygoing days.
The trends that developed during 
the seventies have spawned under
ground cultures galore in todays soci
ety. It was the era that gave us sex, 
drugs, and rock n roll.
Andbell-bottoms. H&SS undecided 
sophomore Ben Shutlz said, I have a 
pair of bell-bottoms at home. Hiphugging, the whole nine yards.
: Besides bell-bottoms, the seven
ties gave us a whole slew of popu
lar fashion items. Vintage stores have 
sprung up all around Pittsburgh sell
ing everything from tie-dye shirts to 
platform shoes. Even high fashion 
has gone retro at times, returning 
to long, patterned dresses and tiedye shirts.
The bands of the seventies inno
vated a brand of music that is still 
popular today. Says Shultz, Ive 
always liked the music. Ive dug on 
Zeppelin, Sabbath, Parliament, and 
all those bands that came out then. 
Many of the artists of this era are still 
around in some form or another. 
Bands like Aerosmith, the Eagles, 
and the Rolling Stones will 
never diethey just 
get louder.
Robert
dig hippie lifestyle
Plant, Ozzy Osbourne, and George 
Clinton have been putting out charttopping albums even though they arent 
with their bands anymore.
A Seattle-based music movement 
known to MTV viewers as grunge 
had its roots deep in seventies guitar 
rock. In fact, if you ask any musician, 
grunge or otherwise, for their influ
ences, chances are theyll list at least 
oneband birthed by the seventies. With
out the creative explosion that was the 
seventies, we wouldnt have genres like 
heavy metal, rap, funk, and the recent 
wave of funkadelic gangsta rap.
Contrary to popular belief, disco is 
not dead. Its just hiding under 
the broader guise of 
dance music. 
You can
even find clubs where they still allow 
people to do the hustle. Unbeknownst 
to most teenagers, the rave scene is a 
direct descendant of the disco scene. 
Im talking bell-bottoms and strobe 
lights and funk, says James Scull, 
sophomore electrical and computer 
engineering major. Disco moved 
dance music from being sock-hop stuff 
to beat-driven music.
But there are some aspects of the 
seventies sadly absent from contem
porary culture, accordingto Dilworth. 
[In the seventies] there was a huge 
environmental concern. There was a 
huge push to save the planet.... Get
ting a lifelong career was not a con
sideration, so people could go out and 
do things like the Peace Corps, or 
volunteer after graduation. Unfor
tunately, this seventies ideal may 
have been lost in politics.
But beware of going totally retro.
The importance of the seventies is to 
put it into the context of the nine
ties, said Shultz. So remember 
where it all came from next time 
you curl up inyour.day-glo poly
ester leisure suit in front of 
with a bottle ofYoo-Hoo.

The Reviewer: Robert Kraut
Robert Kraut is Professor of Social Psychology and Human Computer Interaction and has a 
joint appointment in the Human Computer Interaction Institute, Social and Decision 
Sciences, and GSIA. His interests are in understanding the social impact of computing and 
communications technology. He has conducted research on the impact of computing on pro
ductivity and quality of work life, and is one of the principal investigators on the HomeNet 
project, investigating how average citizens use the Internet. He has this to say about the 
author and the book:
Carnegie Mellon is sometimes known as Computer U. For many of us, 
building computers and software or deploying them in organizations will 
be our lifes work. Tom Landauer challenges us to consider whether we 
are doing these jobs well. He makes a compelling case that our society is 
getting less productivity payoff from computers than is desirable or that 
we should expect, given the level of investment our country has made. He 
argues that the way we make software is at the root of this problem.

In the fall of 1981, Steven Spielberg 
was a busy person. That summer his 
smash hit, Raiders of the Lost Ark, broke 
records at the box office. He was working 
on two feature films: E.T. and Polter
geist. While he was directing E.T., he 
actually wrote the story, co-wrote the 
screenplay, and produced Poltergeist.
/^i What: Poltergeist Original Motion 
Picture Soundtrack 
Label: Rhino Movie Music/Turner 
______Classic Movies Music
In fact, with a presence on the set 
almost everyday, it was rumored that 
Spielberg practically directed Poltergeist 
himself, instead of Tobe Hooper, who 
Spielberg had teamed with to make the 
movie. In the end, after a lot of specula
tion in the media, Spielberg took out an 
ad in the Hollywood trade papers quell
ing all rumors: Tobe Hooper directed, 
and Spielberg did practically every
thing else.
As part of the agreement, Spielberg 
would be in control of the post-produc
tion aspect of the film, including the 
musical score. Since his usual pick, John 
Williams, was busy working on the score 
to E.T., Spielberg asked Jerry Gold
smith to write the score. At the time, 
Goldsmith had already made his name 
in Hollywood with over 100 movie scores, 
including the Oscar-winning score to 
The Omen.
What resulted was one of the most 
sought-after and hard-to-find scores of 
the last 15 years. Released as a 30- 
minute LP in 1982, the score to Polter
geist was incomplete and short-lived. It
became a collectors item after only a few appeared on the LP. There are now more 
years, and a release has never been is- than 30 minutes of new music, including

Band plays variety of styles on CD
By AMY BERGER
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
If you like different styles of music, 
coherent lyrics that you can understand, 
and great guitar riffs to back it all up, 
Bill White Acres Billys Not Bitter is 
worth a listen. The band proves its abil
ity to play well in styles that range from 
rock to pseudo-funk, and the lead vocalon percussion and vocals, and Justin 
Meldal-Johnsen on bass. The songs Boy 
and Come Clean include David 
Campbell on violin and viola, and Larry 
Corbett on cello. But dont be misled into 
thinking that these are orchestral pieces 
or classical in any way. Like the rest of 
the songs on the album, these have a 
down-to-earth feel that really tries to 
appeal to the common man.
The bands music 
fits the lyrics  
slower melodies 
seem to go with songs 
about loss and long
ing, while a harder 
rock sound accompa
nies more angry sub
jects. Most of the lyr
ics are about frustra
tion over love, ended 
relationships, and 
being trapped in a 
place where nothing 
and no one matters. 
The song Boy tells 
of the true nature of 
a boy who longs for a 
better life than he is 
living. I am the sun, 
the center of my 
world, radiant and 
sparkly and warm.

The bass dictates the pulse of the song

refreshing and notable acoustic turn on

Just a Dream.
The band displays its talent for a dif
ferent style in Holy War, Follow, and 
Just a Dream. In Holy War, a slow 
ballad, you can hear the longing in Bill 
Acres voice as he recalls a love he once 
had and wants to have again. Follow is 
a mans pledge to comfort and protect 
his lover from danger, and Just a 
Dream tells the story of someone trying 
to accept a breakup. The bass, guitars, 
and percussion mesh together in a great 
intro to All 4 Love, a song about a 
prostitute who sells herself to show oth
ers that they are worthy of love.
The CD included a hidden 15th track. 
Unfortunately, this unlabeled track 
didnt resemble coherent music. I was 
disappointed to 
hear what sounded

Pianist performs

The white-maned lion of the key

pianists. A super virtuoso. A child 
prodigy. These are all titles that Earl 
Wild has earned throughout his pres
tigious musical career, and based on 
his most recent accomplishments, he 
has proven he has no intentions of 
slowing down.
The 81-year-old pianist was the first 
to broadcast a solo recital live simulta
neously over the Internet and radio
self; he only reached inside his coat 
pocket for a handkerchief once, and 
that was immediately following the 
two-hour performance and before he 
promptly granted the audience a 
thrilling encore. His stage manner
isms reflected the true performance 
veteran that he is.
The skill with which Wild attacked 
the various pieces and the obvious 
emotion with which he played clearly 
impressed the audience, as they 
granted him three standing ovations, 
one before the intermission, one at 
the end of the concert, and one after

dress and immediately commanded 
the attention of everyone in the hall. 
As he began playing, the reason why 
he has garnered so many accolades 
during his lifetime became obvious  
no matter how hard you stared at his 
fingers, you couldnt even see them 
move. Flying up and down the key
board with the grace of humming
birds, they were so quick that you 
werent sure if they were actually mov
ing at all. His posture and calm com
posure made you wonder if he wasnt 
possibly willing the piano to play ithis encore. One can only imagine how 
loud the applause must have actually 
been, given that the members of the 
audience surely werent the only ones 
clapping  radio and Internet listen
ers were probably offering Wild an 
ovation as well. Surely the performance 
was a big hit all around the world.
Wild was born in Pittsburgh in 
1915, and was enrolled at Carnegie 
Tech throughout junior high and 
high school, and graduated from 
the institution in 1937. He is cur
rently a distinguished Visiting Artist-in-Residence at CMU, and last fall 
he was given an Alumni Merit Award. 
He also won a 1997 Grammy for his 
most recent album, Earl Wild  The 
Romantic Master.
While it seems that he has accom
plished more in one lifetime than many 
could even imagine, his natural talent 
and ongoing success seem to indicate 
that we have not heard the last of Earl 
Wild. Who knows what milestone he 
will conquer in the 21st centuryfirst 
pianist to give a live recital from outer 
space? Perhaps.
Whats the best way to tell 
7000 people about my business 
in one fell swoop?

Musician grows up 
on new solo album
By BRENDAN BOSWORTH
,!Tartan Junior Staffwriler
There used to be a show called Kids 
.Incorporated, where a bunch of smiley
faced mini-stars ran around a pizza 
shop lip-synching and playing air gui
tar. Rahsaan Patterson, named after 
jazz saxophonist Rahsaan Roland Kirk, 
.was one of those kids. Now hes grown 
(up like the rest of us, and is taking his 
talent to an adult audience with his 
self-titled debut on MCA.
/\I Who: Rashaan Patterson 
rG What: Rashaan Patterson
Label: MCA Records_____________
He is a young singer-songwriter who, 
at first glance, will draw comparisons to 
any number of pop/R&B artists. His 
new CD has its drawbacks, but it pre
serves the musicianship and live sound 
that is so often sacrificed in the modern 
R&B we see on MTV. He and producer 
Jamey Jaz, along with numerous other 
.musicians, have put together a slick 
, mix of songs that are pleas
ing to listen to but lack con, sistency in quality and style.
On songs like Where You 
Are, So Fine, and My 
. Sweetheart, the vocal ar, rangements and choice of in
strumentation (clavenet, 
fender rhodes, moog, acous
tic guitar) show that 
Patterson paid close atten
tion to the classic Stevie Won' der records of the 70s. Songs 
like these have a full-band, 
electric sound that best dis
plays his rich vocals and love 
for the groove. However, the 
song titles alone show that 
Pattersons lyrical ideas are 
.nothing new  the stale 
words in songs like Cant We 
Wait a Minute, Come Over, 
and Stay Awhile make you Rahsaan
wonder whether Patterson is send
ing a message or a mating call.
The sound on this record ranges 
from intense funk to lightweight, 
sappy love songs. One highlight of 
the record is Joy, a collaboration 
with members of Take 6, a group 
whose a-capella talent puts Boyz II 
Men to shame. Bringing yet another 
style to the CD, their gospel-influenced sound is the ultimate vehicle 
for the careful vocal arrangements 
that Patterson and Jamey Jaz have 
used to color much of the album.
Patterson is capable of mimicking 
P-Funk or Bobby Brown, but he is 
still searching for his own sound. 
There is no doubt that he can help 
rescue R&B from the drum tracks 
and sampling that are killing its cre
ativity, but he still doesnt yet have 
the vision of artists like Terence Trent 
DArby or MeShell NdegeOcello. 
Hell have to continue to develop 
his lyrical and harmonic sense if he 
wants to become more than just one 
of the Kids.

A visit to The Process Behind the

costumes, sets, and lighting designs used 
in CMU drama productions, is a con
stant battle against the urge to squeal,

"The Process Behind the Scenes features costumes 
used in theater productions.
Wow, thats so neat! The show is com
plete sensory overload  what with so 
many sketches and scale models and 
complicated costumes and painted backit creates serves as an effective back
ground to the art.
Through its combination of sketches, 
scale models, and objects that actually 
made it into the productions, this ex
hibit excels at showing the viewer stepby-step exactly how what we see on 
stage came to be. For example, after 
admiring Allison 
Achauers sketch of a lady 
in a severe black Victo
rian dress for Cloud Nine, 
you realize that the dress 
hanging on a mannequin 
nearby is the very same 
one, down to the big cameo 
pin at the neck. The upclose-and-personal format 
of the show worked espe
cially well in allowing 
viewers to notice the skill
ful tailoring and fine pe
riod detail of the costumes, 
whether it was the careful 
sewing of Achauers Vic
torian dress or the big crys
tal necklace completing an 
ensemble to be worn with 
flair.
Many of the works on 
display appear to have 
been conceived as general 
skill-building exercises. While not as 
polished as the pieces that were used in 
actual productions, theyre more excit
ing to look at than you might think. Big,
drops. And all of it shows creativity and textured paintings, which Im assuming 
good craftsmanship. You can 
only stand there and feel in 
awe of the talents of the the
ater technicians.
This show represents a 
great opportunity for the 
underappreciated technical 
components of theater to take 
center stage. Its a reminder of 
just how much work goes into 
the details of a theatrical pro
duction. For that extra Verisi
militude, lighting gear, a draft
ing table, a sewing machine, 
and other technical-theater 
paraphernalia are strewn 
about the room. Some of this is 
admittedly a little corny (i.e. 
the carefully-placed post-it 
notes on the drafting table),
but the workshop atmosphere A model of a set is shown as part of the exhibit at

ered one wall. The most captivating!of 
these is a painting of a hot fudge sundae 
blown up to about 100 times life-size. I#s 
rendered so deliciously that I was afraid 
my stomach would start growling (which 
would be even more embarrassing than 
would be squealing aloud about the aliaround neatness of the work).
If the hot fudge sundae wasnt enough j 
for you, Chris Joness backdrop for Spring 
Awakening shows you how effective skill- ! 
ful background painting can be. Tfte ! 
backdrop, meant to be a forest, looks like j 
a huge impressionist painting. Its re- j 
ally beautiful. The show included giant ! 
blue creatures with weird faces. Te j 
plaster masks used to make these faces 
are on display too, and are definitely 
worth looking at. Very neat.
Other highlights of the exhibit include i

documents the numerous steps he we'fit 
through to develop the lighting design 
for a ballet production, a series i'Bf

Patricia Arquette, and that shes naked 
a good deal of the time. I can also tell 
you that Bill Pullman is in it, you know, 
the guy who played the president in 
ID4. You know who else is in it? That 
guy who always reminds me of Gene 
Hackman for some reason, Robert Log
gia, the general in ID4. The film also 
features sporadic witty inserts by people 
who were not in ID4, such as Richard 
Pryor, Henry Rollins, and Marilyn 
Manson. A good deal of the acting is 
done by Balthazar Getty, who I think 
looks like a young, sideburn-toting 
Charlie Sheen.
If you want to see this movie, make 
sure you go now, while it is still in the 
theater. This is a film which only works 
photographically on the big screen. 
Many shots use so little light that video 
will simply be unable to render the tiny 
details that the film was able to pick up. 
Director of photography Peter Deming 
should be given the Legion of Honor for 
his amazing lightwork and his brusque 
defiance of the home video market.
I know what youre still thinking: If 
this movies so good, why wont he tell me 
what its about? See it, then try to de
scribe it, and you will understand.
My only advice is to walk in as if you 
have never seen a movie before. Dont 
try to make it behave like other movies, 
because it wont. From the very first 
frame to the closing credits, just sit 
back and marvel.
Album does not meet expectations

Live, the rock quartet from York, 
Pennsylvania, took their jolly good time 
in between the breakthrough Throw
ing Copper, released in 1994, and their 
new album, which was released on Feb
ruary 18. After taking nearly three 
years off, one would think they had 
plenty of time to write a great followup. Unfortunately, Secret Samadhi is 
occasionally great, mostly mediocre, 
and sometimes even awful.

There are some gems amidst the rest. 
The opening track, Rattlesnake, is a 
nifty ditty. This is classic Live, some
thing you may miss after listening to 
some of the other songs on this CD. 
Lakinis Juice is catchy tune with an 
interesting use of strings, and it seems 
to get better with each listen. It also 
happens to be the first single.
Gas Hed Goes West, the final track, 
is an emotionally intense song remi
niscent of the better songs on Throw
ing Copper. My favorite track, how
ever, is the beautiful Ghost. The use 
of Jennifer Charless breathy voice in 
combination with the band in top form 
and some particularly poignant lyrics 
create a gorgeous soundscape.

The album is predominantly your stan

so the song titles leave

un-fun track, but the 
worst offender is Un

This might have worked,

that Patrick Dalheimers

Welcome to the Dollhouse
The dollhouse is a lot like the terror dome, except 
it lacks a waterslide lined with cheese graters. My 
friend Jason came up with that idea when we were 
in seventh grade, just like the protagonist of this 
film, Dogface.
Dogface is a lovable young girl with a penchant for 
rotating knives and voodoo melons. Once under 
Dogfaces evil spell, her little sister abducts herself 
and tries to force tapioca pudding to spew from her 
elbows. Then her friends brother learns to play the 
sitar and starts a one-man pool installation com
pany. His secret: volume. Then they all go on a field 
trip or something and make it the feel-good comingof-age movie of the week.

Danger: Diabolik
Im not going to he to you, I havent the slightest 
idea what this 1968 film with an Italian crew is 
about. All I know is that theres this guy named 
Diabolik, so I have to assume his parents were 
pretty sure he was evil when he popped out in the 
delivery room, or at least diabolical. Maybe they 
named him Fredo, and he later had his name legally 
changed in order to pick up chicks. Anyway, he 
meets up with this lady named Eva, and apparently 
theres some kind of danger involved. Maybe he gets 
up too fast on a wooden folding chair, and he gets a

Comic Book 
Chronicles
by Max Chittister
Whoever said comics arent for 
kids anymore? Between the two, 
Marvel and DC have four titles 
aimed at introducing young read
ers to their heroes.
One of the most successful se
ries launched by DC comics in the 
last five years is The Batman and 
Robin Adventures (formerly 
known as The Batman Adven
tures). Based on the Fox TV show 
of the same name, The Batman 
and Robin Adventures features 
storylines wrapped up in a single 
issue; simple, clear artwork; and 
refreshing new takes on some old 
characters, as well as fascinating 
new characters.
No doubt, The Batman Adven
tures hit its peak with Mad Love, 
by Paul Dini and Bruce Timm, 
which won both the Harvey and 
Eisner awards for best single
issue comic of the year in 1994. 
This story focuses primarily on 
Harley Quinn, a character cre
ated specifically for Batman Ad

much on the younger audi
ence. The plots are just too 
simple. The most recent is
sue, number 17, features a 
story where the Mad Hater 
fakes his own death. But 
there are no clues for the 
reader to find this out; in
stead, the Hater comes right 
out and describes everything.
Theres no mystery, and 
theres no incentive for the 
reader to think. In Mad Love, 
for example, the plot un
folded bit by bit, and the 
reader had the opportunity 
to make discoveries along 
with Batman. But not now.
Based on the sales success 
of Batman and Robin, DC 
has launched two new Ad
ventures books in the last six 
months, The Superman Adven
tures and Adventures in the DC 
Universe. In an effort to capi

cant recommend this title, as 
much as Id like to. Its too closely 
tied to the TV series, and who 
gets the WB network, anyway?
Adventures in the DCU isnt 
based on a cartoon; its just sim

the same characters that appear 
in mainstream DC books. These 
characters arent recreated, as 
they were in Superman and 
Batman and Robin. The first is

the Justice League and a band of 
supervillains, might as well have 
been an episode of Super Friends, 
without Gleek the Wonder Mon
key. This could be a great book for 
a new generation of comic book 
readers, but the old generation 
could read a single issue in five 
minutes.
No doubt, the worst of the ney 
crop is Marvel Adventures. The 
art is uneven, the writing is over
loaded with clunky exposition 
about the Hulks origin that just 
about everybody knows anyway, 
and the dialogue is the kind of 
trite crap that any child could 
write. Instead of being simpler, 
this book is just dumb.
So if you want to start a young
ster on comic books, get MadLove. 
Maybe pick up The Batman arid 
Robin Adventures. None of the 
other books are worth the money.

Gangster movie goes beyond genre

Donnie Brasco chronicles the

Play gives insight into mind of Nixon
ByALEXLEWIN
Tartan Features Co-Editor
How should it end? That question must have plagued playwright 
Russell Lees when he was working on Nixons Nixon.
The entire play takes place in the Lincoln Room of the White House 
on August 7,1974. The tension, then, comes out of the play being a 
dramatization of a historical event: Henry Kissingers late-night 
meeting with Nixon on the eve of Nixons resignation. But we know
how its going to end: 
Nixon will decide to go 
ahead and quit.
Lees had his work cut 
out for him. He has to 
keep us interested in a 
long conversation be
tween two men  
Kissinger, who wants 
his President to resign 
before he is impeached, 
and Nixon, who is 
searching for a way to 
stay in office  and give 
us some sort of payoff in 
a situation whose outcome we already know.
Getting there isnt always easy. Although Leess dialogue is, for the 
most part, efficient and steadily progressive, it occasionally lapses 
into tasteless humor or recreations of scenes from the past by the two 
characters. Not all of it is necessary, and some of it feels like stuff 
Lees threw in to pad the script so that it would run 90 minutes.
Leess take on Nixon and Kissinger is a very funny one. He 
portrays Kissinger as being the political force behind Nixon  the 
one who came up with, among other things, such ideas as the 
Cambodia bombing. While Kissinger feels for Nixon, his primary 
concern is maintaining his own power. The view of Nixon himself is 
largely sympathetic, even if Nixon comes off as a little rash and not 
very bright. But when he gets on his knees and loudly prays and

(Nixon) recreate a dramatic scene.
begins to cry, you cannot help but feel for him.
The actors, Jack Ryiand as Nixon and Roger Serbagi as Kissinger, 
are excellent. They listen to and work off each other, and neither 
overdoes his role as a famous figure; they dont do grand imitations 
of Nixon and Kissinger. Rather, they feel like Nixon and Kissinger 
without forcing the voices or postures to be exact duplications.
This play is seen in the round and director Constantine Arvanitakis 
blocks it with great skill. His use of music, which fades in and out at 
particularly emotional moments in the play, is questionable, but 
wisely kept to a minimum.
In the end, weve been through a great and serious, and often funny, 
journey with these two men, and its because of this that Lees manages 
to make the obvious ending work. Because we know these men, and we 
know how they feel and what they want, we can see Nixons resignation 
through their eyes (Nixons eyes in particular). We see the event, but 
through a point of view we could not have expected. This is where Lees 
gives us the payoff we need. Though a bit surreal, it is visually beautiful 
and oddly moving. But I dont want to give it away.
Nixons Nixon plays at the Pittsburgh Public Theatre through April 
6. For tickets or more information, call 321-9800.
