The Presidents new house is the most expensive sale in city history.
ByASEEM S. GUPTA
Tartan Acting Features Editor
The Universitys board of trust
ees recently approved a real es
tate deal in which CMU will pur
chase a new house for the presi
dent. The purchase, valued at 
$1.725 million, will include a $1.4- 
million home in Northumberland 
Street, and $300,000 worth of ap
pliances and decorations.
The $1.725-million transaction 
is the largest residential real es
tate transaction in Pittsburghs 
history. There are other homes 
that are more expensive; this just 
happens to be the most-expensive 
sale, said Don Hale, vice presi
dent of University Relations.
It will be a great addition to the 
University, said President Jared 
Cohon. [The house] will be osten
sibly for all sorts of activities. I 
feel very good about the house.
There are a number of uses 
that the presidents house will be 
put to [for the University], said 
Thomas McConomy, a trustee and 
former president of the board of 
trustees. It is not a house for 
President Cohon and his wife  
it is a house for the president of 
the University.
The home will replace the 
presidents current residence, 
also on Northumberland Street. 
Currently, Cohon and his wife 
live in a condominium which was 
purchased by the University 
shortly before Cohon took his 
current position. We had every 
intention of having the president 
live close to campus in a CMU 
house, said McConomy. As an 
interim home, it [the condo
minium] was okay.
McConomy, who has been a part 
of the presidential home search 
for many years, said that the
trustees always felt that the con
dominium was insufficient for the 
president of CMU. We knew 
there would be substantial ex
penses involved to make the nec
essary improvements to the home 
[to make it suitable to be the 
presidents home].
The new home will provide op
portunities for the kinds of meet
ings that are part of the fundraising 
effort of the University, said Hale. 
It is a place to host supporters and 
guests of the University. A place 
like this is part of what a major 
university does.
The[condo] doesnt lend itself 
to large events, said Cohon. The 
trustees were never satisfied with 
the house as a presidents home. 
Among the many features lack
ing in the current home is acces
sibility for disabled guests. Both 
Cohon and McConomy empha
sized the importance of the 
presidents home being compli
ant with the Americans with Dis
abilities Act.
The new presidential home has 
9,000 square feet offloor space and 
features several areas on the 
ground floor where the president 
will be able to hold social events for 
trustees, faculty, staff, students, 
and friends of the University. The 
property is large enough to accom
modate the entire senior class, o 
According to Cohon, the 
University began to look 
into the purchase of the 
Northumberland Street house 
several weeks ago. The Univer
sity first had to sign a contract

CMU students win government scholarships
By ANWESHA RAKSHIT
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
When Kyle Dupre, a senior in busi
ness administration, received the news 
from his parents that he had won a 
Fulbright scholarship, he first assumed 
that they were playing a trick on him. 
Only after his parents started mispro
nouncing German names did he realize 
that he had actually received it. He then 
called all the professors that had writ
ten his recommendations to thank them. 
Similarly, Marian Diaz Goebes, a senior 
in civil engineering, called her profes
sors, family, and friends and expressed 
her joy.
I was screaming for about an hour. 
Ask my roommate  I was quite wild, 
said Goebes.
The Fulbright scholarship is an inter
national educational exchange program
established by Congress in 1946 under 
legislation introduced by then-Senator 
J. William Fulbright. It was created to 
increase mutual understanding and 
peaceful relations between the people of 
the United States and the people of 
other countries. It is administered by 
the U.S. government in cooperation with 
135 countries around the world.
Both students are very excited about 
their achievements and will be going 
abroad to spend a year pursuing re
search opportunities and learning new 
cultures. Dupre learned about the schol
arship through the office of scholarships 
and fellowships (which notifies students 
about a few of the scholarship possibili
ties before graduation). Goebes recalls 
hearing of the scholarship during a pre
sentation given by Joseph Rudman, the 
CMU  Fulbright advisor, and Irving 
Oppenheim in the spring of 1998.
Dupre chose to pursue his Fulbright 
opportunity in Germany. He will be 
attending the Wissenschuftlich 
Hochschule Fur Unternehmens 
Fuhrung (WHU) in Mannheim from 
mid-August 1999 to mid-July 2000. I 
have a minor in German; one of the 
prerequisites is that students will have 
to speak the language fairly fluently to 
be able to do graduate level research 
and classes, he said. He hopes that the 
benefit of the Fulbright program will 
help him improve his language skills. 
Dupres study in Germany will be an 
extension of his senior thesis, which 
was on Efficient Consumer Response 
(ECR) in the grocery industry. He will 
observe the implementation of this 
American concept in a German economy 
and see that the differences are and 
how it fares.

Alert center warns world about fast-spreading virus
By SRIRAM GOLLAPALLI
Tartan Staffwriter
At about 2 pm on Friday March 26, 
the Computer Emergency Response 
Team Coordination Center (CERT/CC) 
at Carnegie Mellon began to collect 
many reports of a particular Microsoft 
Word 97 and Word 2000 macro virus 
affecting computers around the globe.
CERT found out about the virus 
because people called our hotline and 
told us that they were being affected, 
said Bill Pollack, CERT/CC spokes
man. In such cases, our staff works 
with vendors and others in the Internet 
community to understand the virus 
and post information to the commu
nity about how to mitigate problems.
The entire CERT/CC immediately 
went to work, taking the virus code 
apart to discover how it worked. About 
15 hours later, Saturday morning, they 
posted an advisory on how to get rid of 
the newly found Melissa virus.
CERT posts about 20 advisories each 
year about incidents such as this one, 
said Pollack.
Their analysis of this macro virus 
indicated that some sort of human 
action is required for it to spread. 
Some email programs could have the 
virus automatically sent to many 
people and then proceed to open an 
infected document.
The virus uses a combination of 
Microsoft Word 97 or Word 2000 mac
ros and Microsoft Outlook to send a 
list of about 80 pornographic Web 
sites. It will send itself to all of the 
email addresses in the address book 
on the computer with the subject line 
Important message from followed 
by the senders name. It will attach 
the file that contains the sites as well 
as the virus.
The CERT at Carnegie Mellon was 
the first such team ever created. In 
1988, the Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency created the CERT 
as a response to computer security 
events involving Internet hosts. 
CERT received its first hotline call 
on the day its formation was an
nounced. CERTs are charged with 
finding out how to defeat new vi
ruses, usually within hours after 
those programs are released.
CERT/CC advisories address 
Internet security problems. They in
clude an explanation of the problem, 
some information that will help a user 
determine if they have the problem, 
fixes or workarounds, and vendor con
tact information.
As soon as the CERT/CC advisory 
was posted Saturday morning, more 
than 30,000 copies were downloaded 
in a few hours. They also put out a 
press release to ensure that the ma
jority of the affected population was 
made aware of the virus and its 
implications.
The CERT/CC received phone calls 
all week from people who have been 
affected by the virus. They estimated 
that the bug affected more than
100,000 machines. Lucent Technolo
gies Inc., the worlds largest telecom
munications equipment maker, re
ceived a copy of the infected email 
message lastFriday. They proceeded 
to shut down their email system for 
the weekend to protect themselves.
The Federal Bureau of Investiga
tion has had an ongoing investiga
tion into the origin of the virus. Last 
Friday, April 2, a New Jersey man, 
David L. Smith, was arrested by fed
eral officials with the charge of creat
ing and distributing the Melissa vi
rus. He was tracked down with the 
help of America Online and by trac
ing phone calls. He was released on 
$100,000 bond in the afternoon.

2The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  5 April 1999
 
FBI nabs possible virus programmer
TRENTON, N.J. (AP)  The man 
accused of creating the so-called Mel
issa virus, which infected thousands 
of computers and overloaded email 
systems worldwide, never intended to 
do anything wrong, his lawyer said 
Saturday.
David L. Smith, a 30-year-old com
puter programmer, will plead inno
cent to the state charges, said lawyer 
Steven Altman.
Smith was arrested Thursday night 
at his brothers house in Eatontown. He 
faces charges that include interruption 
of public communications, conspiracy, 
and theft of computer servicecharges 
that cany a maximum penalty of 40 
years in prison and a $480,000 fine.
Altman said his client had been 
wrongfully portrayed as a dangerous 
computer-hacker and been victimized 
by the governments crackdown on 
high-tech crimes.
The computer world is a world where 
people do things, experimental things, 
just about every day, Altman said. 
Nothing he did, or intended to do, had 
a premeditated or wrongful intent.
Smith was released Friday on 
$100,000 bail.
Hes very upset, scared, and ner
vous. This has been a horrible ordeal. 
They went in there as gangbusters  
local authorities, state police, the FBI. 
Ted Bundy, thats what they treated 
him like, Altman said, referring to 
the serial killer executed in Florida 10 
years ago. No court appearance had 
been scheduled.
The virus spread around the world 
Monday like a chain letter, arriving in 
email messages with the heading im
portant message. It then caused af
fected computers to fire off 50 more 
infected messages, and the volume of
email slowed some systems to a crawl.
Smith, who worked as an on-site 
consultant, or a troubleshooter, for 
AT&T Labs in Florham Park, employed 
by Iselin-based CGS Computer Asso
ciates, was tracked down by a task 
force of federal and state agents, with 
help from America Online technicians.
AOL contacted state authorities af
ter its own investigation turned up 
evidence that pointed to New Jersey, 
said Christopher Bubb, head of a state 
computer analysis unit.
The New York Times reported Satur
day that investigators determined that 
the first copy of the Melissa virus origi
nated from an account with Monmouth 
Internet Corp., based in Red Bank, and 
then traced it to Smiths telephone line.
Monmouth Internet gave New Jer
sey investigators records of Internet 
use on March 26, the day Melissa 
appeared, confirmed Mark R. Stevens, 
the companys operations manager.
Apparently frightened when the FBI 
posted a warning about Melissa last 
week, Smith threw his computer equip
ment into a trash bin at his apartment 
complex, investigators said.
Computer experts used unique iden
tification numbers embedded in docu
ments to trace Melissa back to a wellknown virus writer who calls himself 
VicodinES, but authorities said Smith 
was not the person known by that 
handle. They suspect Smith took two 
viruses, one of which came from 
VicodinES, and combined them with 
another virus to create Melissa.
VicodinES, or Extra Strength, also 
happens to be the name of a narcotic 
pain killer.
There was no comment from Smith 
on Saturday. Altman would not say 
where he was staying.
Country refuses 
Kosovo refugees
BLACE, Macedonia (AP)  With an 
estimated 65,000 Kosovo Albanians 
jammed at its border and more coming, 
Macedonia announced Saturday it wont 
accept any more refugees unless they 
can go on to other European countries.
Heavily armed police patrolled the 
cold, muddy field in this river valley 
along the border with Yugoslavia, where 
a sea of refugees huddled overnight in 
freezing drizzle.
The mounting crisis, with similar scenes 
in Albania and the Yugoslav Republic of 
Montenegro, was fastbecomingthe worstcase scenario that western officials had 
hoped to prevent by launching NATO 
airstrikes on Yugoslavia on March 24.
But Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevics forces have escalated their 
campaign to drive ethnic Albanians out 
of Kosovo, according to accounts from 
those who arrived crammed in trains, 
buses and carts, or on foot.
NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said in 
Brussels on Saturday that as many as
300,000 more refugees were believed to 
be en route to Kosovos borders.
At this rate, the Serb security forces 
would have more or less emptied Kosovo 
within 10 to 20 days from now, Shea said.
Saying its fragile democracy and 
economy were at stake, Macedonias top 
government officials said the army would 
prevent the illegal entry of any more 
refugees because the country could not 
handle the influx.
The security situation in the country 
could be seriously endangered because 
of the huge wave of refugees from 
Kosovo, the Macedonian Security Coun
cil said after an all-night meeting.
Interior Minister Pavle Trajanov said 
Macedonia would only accept refugees 
who can be transferred elsewhere, in
cluding European Union countries.
Gen. Trajce Krstevski, chief of the 
Macedonian general staff, announced a 
partial mobilization of the 12,000-member 
armed forces for controlling the frontier.
Macedonia, a former Yugoslav 
republic, has Serb and ethnic Albanian 
communities and officials fear that 
the tensions that exploded into 
open conflict in Kosovo could sweep 
their country.
The council also asked the interna
tional community to provide urgent as
sistance to prevent the humanitarian 
catastrophe.
In Germany, Chancellor Gerhard 
Schroeder announced his country would 
be willing to accept some refugees and 
would talk to other European Union 
countries about doing so as well.
Husband pleads 
for wifes statue
SMITHTON, Penn. (AP)  They had 
trouble in River City when Shirley Jones 
starred in The Music Man. Now the 
troubles in her hometown.
Marty Ingels, Jones husband, wants 
to give her a statue and a park for her 
birthday, but city officials dont want to 
have to maintain them.
Our entire city budget is $35,000. I 
know the car Marty drives is worth more 
than that, said Fred Foster, president 
of the City Council.
Ingels is fed up with the town of 400, 
about 30 miles from Pittsburgh, and may 
put the statue at Westmoreland County 
Community College 10 miles away.
What started out to be a lovely, joyous 
thing has become Vietnam, Hiroshima
 a nightmare for me, Ingels said.
Ohio student bus 
crash hurts many
LIMA, Ohio (AP)  A bus carrying 
high school students returning from a 
tour of Canada went off an interstate 
highway Saturday and landed in an 
embankment, injuring 34 people, the 
State Highway Patrol said.
The bus driver, Robert G. Shattuck, 
55, of Peebles, apparently fell asleep 
while traveling on Interstate 75 about
four miles south of Lima. He was cited 
for impaired alertness, said Sgt. Mary 
Cosgrove of the patrols Lima post.
Cosgrove said the bus, owned by 
Croswell Bus Lines of Williamsburg, 
veered off the right side of the road 
at 6:15 am, traveled 700 feet down a 
hill, smashed into a tree and landed in 
the embankment.
On board were 41 people, 34 of whom 
were students taking part in the fourday tour, sponsored by Wittenberg Uni
versity in Springfield.
Cosgrove said 27 of the injured were 
taken to Lima Memorial Hospital and 
seven to St. Ritas Medical Center. All 
were treated and released with injuries 
ranging from cuts and bruises to neck 
and back strains and dizziness.
Pittsburgh minor 
faces adult jury
PITTSBURGH (AP)  A 15-year-old 
accused of killing a science teacher at a 
middle-school dance last year will be 
tried as an adult.
The pain that the shooting caused 
the victims family and the community 
outweighed Andrew Wursts immatu
rity and claims of mental illness, Erie 
County Judge Michael Palmisano 
wrote Thursday.
The evidence suggests the defendant 
made a conscious decision to arm him
self with a deadly weapon and ammuni
tion, after which he selected his victims 
and executed his plan, the judge said.
Wurst is charged with killing teacher 
John Gillette at a Parker Middle School 
graduation dance in Edinboro in April 
1998. Wurst was 14 and in eighth grade 
at the time. He also faces two attempted 
murder counts for wounding two stu
dents, among other charges.
State law mandates Wurst be tried as 
an adult because authorities charged 
him with homicide. The teens attorney 
had asked Palmisano to try Wurst in 
juvenile court, arguing he was more 
likely to get treatment for mental disor
ders in a youth facility.

WASHINGTON (AP)  The 
U.S. military stepped deeper into 
NATOs conflict with Yugosla
via on Saturday, ordering an air
craft carrier and its cruise mis
sile-firing battle group into the 
Adriatic Sea.
The Pentagon also started an 
air convoy to feed Kosovar refu
gees and pledged Marines to help 
with refugee relief planning.
As allied planes and ships 
bombed Serb military targets for 
the 11th straight day, President 
Clinton told Americans that al
though the allied military mis
sion in Kosovo is difficult and 
dangerous, its necessary and 
right. He lamented the suffering 
of hundreds of thousands of 
Kosovar refugees.
For all they have lost, they 
have not been forgotten, Clinton 
said in his weekly radio address. 
He later flew to the presidential 
retreat at Camp David, Md., af
ter speaking by phone from the
White House with the leaders of 
NATO allies Britain, France, and 
Spain, plus Macedonias presi
dent, Kiro Gligorov.
Defense Secretary William 
Cohen ordered the USS 
Theodore Roosevelt and its 
battle group to take up stations 
in the Adriatic instead of con
tinuing to a scheduled deploy
ment to the Persian Gulf.
The Roosevelt adds 75 aircraft
 including 46 strike planes  
to the Operation Allied Force. 
Accompanying the aircraft car
rier are three ships and one at
tack submarine armed with 
Tomahawk cruise missiles.
The Roosevelt entered the west
ern Mediterranean Sea on Satur
day and is expected in the Adriatic 
by Monday, Pentagon spokesman 
Kenneth Bacon said.
Cohen also decided to move the 
aircraft carrier USS Kitty Hawk 
from the Western Pacific to the 
Persian Gulf to replace the USS
Enterprise, which will depart as 
scheduled in mid-April to return 
home to Norfolk, Va. That will 
leave a carrier gap in Asia, de
spite fears of potential trouble in 
communist North Korea.
As a precaution, Cohen said he 
ordered one F-15E fighter squad
ron and an unspecified number of 
B-52 bombers and EA-6B elec
tronic warfare planes to be ready 
to deploy from the United States 
on short notice in the event of a 
crisis in Asia.
He also put the USS Constella
tion, in port at San Diego, on 
alert for potential early deploy
ment. The Constellation is sched
uled to begin its usual six-month 
duty in June.
Even as they waited for clear
ing skies over Yugoslavia before 
accelerating the pace of 
airstrikes, the United States and 
its allies took a series of steps 
Saturday to manage a worsen
ing refugee crisis in Albania and
Macedonia that NATO spokes
man Jamie Shea described as a 
demographic earthquake.
An Air Force C-17 cargo plane 
flew from Dover Air Force Base, 
Del., on Saturday with30,000 highcalorie packaged meals, destined 
for Albania, via an air base in Ger
many. They were for displaced 
Kosovar Albanians. Over the next 
several days military and Penta
gon-contracted civilian planes are 
to ferry 500,000 meals to Albania, 
Bacon told a news conference.
The Air Force also dispatched 
a C-5 transport carrying forklifts and other cargo handling 
equipment to Albania, Bacon 
said. Another C-17 plane was to 
carry a team of people with equip
ment to set up air traffic control 
operations in Albania to help 
manage the influx of humani
tarian relief supplies.
Also, the U.S. European Com
mand in Germany will begin 
shipping 80 U.S. military trucks

and 30 trucks purchased by the 
State Department to Albania to 
help move relief supplies from 
ports and airports, Bacon said. 
In addition, the Pentagon is send
ing 200 tents, 8,000 sleeping 
bags, 3,000 blankets and 1,500 
cots to Macedonia.
Among other developments 
Saturday:
A group of 24 Marines from the 
24thMarine Expeditionary Unit, 
aboard ships now in the Adriatic, 
are heading to both Macedonia 
and Albania to help NATO assess 
the humanitarian operations 
there. The Marine unit originally 
was sent to the area as the van
guard of a Kosovo peacekeeping 
operation that was envisioned in 
a Kosovo peace agreement which 
Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic rejected.
The United States is consider
ing taking in some of the esti
mated 290,000 displaced Kosovar 
Albanians who flooded across the
border into Albania and 
Macedonia over the past'10 days, 
according to a senior administra
tion official, speaking on condi
tion of anonymity.
Thirteen F-117A stealth fighterbombers left Holloman Air Force 
Base, N.M., en route to Germany 
to join NATOs air campaign 
against Yugoslavia. Due to arrive 
Sunday, the additional planes will 
bring to 24 the number of F-117As 
available for missions. One crashed 
in Yugoslavia on March 27.
The United States has learned 
no more about the fate of three 
Army soldiers captured by Serb 
forces last week, Pentagon spokes
man Navy Capt. Steve Pietropaoli 
said. Yugoslav authorities had 
said they would put the three on 
trial for aggression, but their 
status was not clear Saturday. In 
his radio address, Clinton urged 
Americans to pray for the soldiers 
now being held without justifica
tion in Belgrade.Carnegie Almanac

50 YEARS AGO, March 16, 
1949  The University acquired 
a painting of the schools founder, 
Andrew Carnegie, by Howard 
Russel Butler.
The painting had previously 
hung in the Carnegie Mansion in 
New York. President Doherty ob
tained the painting from Roswell 
Miller, Carnegies daughter and 
wife of one of the schools trustees. 
The president had requested that 
the painting be sent to the Uni
versity after learning that the 
familys house would be turned 
over to Columbia University.
The painting currently resides 
in Baker Hall.
25 YEARS AGO, March 19, 
1974  The office of student ac
tivities suffered a blow by losing 
funding from the administration. 
Budgetary restrictions forced
President Cyert to cut off what 
was known as the Discretionary 
Fund, which helped fund smaller 
activities and support organiza
tions with financial difficulties.
Examples of how the fund was 
used include the CMU Film Fes
tival and organizations such as 
the Kiltie Pipers and the Jazz 
Band.
10 YEARS AGO, March 21 
1989  Members of Spirit met 
with administrators and Campus 
Police officials to discuss alleged 
harassment of African Americans.
Those at the meeting included 
Michael Murphy, dean of Stu
dent Affairs, James LaPaglia, 
chief of Campus Police, and mem
bers of the NAACP.
Spirit claimed that the admin
istration had failed to respond 
adequately to suggestions on improving problems that affected 
minority students on campus.
Specifically, one student noted 
how Campus Police stopped black 
students and alumni simply on 
suspicion, causing repeated 
harrassment.
LaPaglia said that there was 
room for improvement, but that 
he felt that the situation was not 
as bad as Spirit suggested.
FIVE YEARS AGO, April 11, 
1994More than $10,000 worth 
of equipment was stolen from 
CFA during a break-in robbery.
Macintosh Quadras, a scanner, 
a Macintosh Ilci, and other pe
ripheral equipment were stolen 
from a new electronics media stu
dio classroom.
In addition to the stolen equip
ment, students saved artwork 
and images were lost.
In related news, thousands of 
dollars of equipment were stolen 
from the Psychology Department, 
and a calculus TA found that 
grades for his recitation sections 
had been erased when his office 
had been broken into.
ONE YEAR AGO, April 6,1998
 Two town meetings were held 
to gauge student opinion on 
the funding of exclusive 
organizations such as fraterni
ties, sororities, and honor societ
ies. The issue in debate 
was whether or not student ac
tivities fees should be allocated 
to Greek organizations. If a reso
lution to do so was approved, they 
would receive money for Booth 
and Buggy.

When asked why he chose a different 
university for his Fulbright opportunity, 
Dupre said that he wished to experience 
another type of university and learn a 
different perspective.
Goebes chose the United Kingdom to 
pursue her Fulbright opportunity. Her 
project proposal was inspired by an in
ternship she had two summers ago in 
acid mine drainage, or water pollution 
caused by coal mining.
There is a really big problem with it 
here in Pennsylvania and other places, 
here in the U.S. and also in the United 
Kingdom, said Goebes.
She will be visiting the University of 
Newcastle in the north of England. 
She had previously received a fellow:|
ship in high school which enabled her 
to visit Ukraine for three weeks, dur
ing which she learned about Ukrai
nian culture and politics and the art of 
making ceramics.
She has maintained contact with 
Paul Younger, a professor at Newcastle 
who is very well-respected in the acid 
mine drainage field in England. She 
will be assisting the research team in 
Newcastle, and though she hasnt fig
ured out exactly what her research 
topic will be, her goal is to help find an 
efficient solution to the acid mine drain
age problem. It will be a nine-month 
project, and she will start when the 
Newcastle University school year be
gins, which will be in approximately 
the middle of September.

ELECTIONS, from page 1
Gross plans to continue work on 
projects started this year, such as the 
Morewood Basement and the Book
store Task Force, in addition to initiat
ing new projects. Some of her plans 
include a delivery service from the 
Morewood Basement Gulliftys, a bas
ketball court, and working with Stu
dent Senate to communicate with the 
students more effectively.
I felt that although I worked on a lot 
of projects this year, there is still a lot of 
work to be done, said Gross. Ive al
ready established good working rela
tionships with many students and ad
ministrators and I feel that given an
other year in office, I can continue to do 
what I have been doing and make im
provements so that this year will be 
even more productive.
In addition to the Student Body ex
ecutive officers, Student Senators were 
also elected this week. Senators, too, 
saw communication as an important 
issue in this election. Nicholas Fitzkee, 
a one-term MCS senator and a sopho
more physics major, hopes that con
tinuing in Senate would allow him to 
continue projects he has begun and 
communicate more effectively with the 
student body.
I came onto Senate last semester; I 
was on the Campus Affairs commit
tee, and through that Ive worked with 
Neil Guzy on some issues like clusters 
and new equipment in the old gym, 
but I didnt feel like we did enough, 
said Fitzkee. One of the things I hope 
to do next year is really establish a 
stronger line of communication be
tween the student body and the Cam
pus Affairs committee.
Fitzkee cites the broken walk button 
at the corner of Morewood and Forbes 
as an example of how Senate needs to 
communicate more effectively with its 
constituents. One of the problems that 
you would need to address in that com
mittee [Campus Affairs] is that some
body would complain [about the but
ton] and then forget about it in the 
thirty seconds it takes to cross the 
street.... One of my goals is to have a 
Campus Affairs table out there at least 
twice a month or so, to just talk to
students and see what they complain 
about, and try to fix it or pass it on to 
someone who can fix it.
Kevin Shiue, a newly elected Sena
tor and a junior computer science ma
jor, said that he, too, ran in part to 
facilitate communication between stu
dents and Senate. After saying mul
tiple times, yu know, Senate should 
do fill in the blank, I realized that if I 
wasnt part of the solution, I was part 
of the problem. I sought to change 
that.... My goal is for each and every 
SCS student to know what Senate is 
working on, and [to] actively solicit 
feedback on everything.
One issue that provoked discussion 
during this round of elections was the 
Interfraternity Councils (IFC) decision 
to compile a list of candidates who are 
affiliated with Greek organizations. The 
list was given to every student affili
ated with a Greek house and posted 
near the elections table outside Doherty 
Hall. Although the IFCs action did not 
break any election rules, some students 
felt that the lists were divisive and 
unfair, encouraging party voting on 
the basis of whether candidates were 
affiliated with Greek houses. All the 
[lists and the poster do] is divide the 
campus further into the Greek and nonGreek constituencies, and I hardly think 
that helps anyone at all, said Shiue. 
Many people voted for the candidates 
they knew would do a good job, regard
less of the status, but there were a 
number of votes on both sides that were 
cast purely on that basis.
Brian Oosterman, the president of the 
Interfraternity Council and a brother of 
Kappa Sigma, declined to comment.
Charles Anthe, a senior electrical and 
computer engineering major and Sen
ate Chair, felt that the controversy was 
good for the elections process. In my 
opinion, anything that sparks interest 
in student government and fosters dis
cussion and ideas is good. They were 
very careful to obey the rules and 
prompted a lot of interesting discussion 
on both sides on a number of issues.... 
Overall, I thought it was a positive en
hancement [of the elections].

Graduates, undergraduates overwhemingly pass PAT deal referendum
By ELLEN BELDNER
Tartan Contributing Editor
CMU students and staff, long used to 
digging for their $1.50 whenever a Port 
Authority Transit (PAT) 61C ap
proaches, are one step closer to flashing 
their ID instead of spare change when 
boarding PAT buses and trains. A refer
endum to gauge student opinion on the 
PAT plan, held March 16-18, passed 
unofficially with 82 percent of under
graduates and 74 percent of graduate 
students in favor.
CMU is currently negotiating with 
PAT to allow anyone with a valid CMU 
ID to ride buses for no fee. The proposed 
arrangement, which is modeled after an 
agreement that the University of Pitts
burgh has with PAT, would cost stu
dents $35 per semester in the form of an 
added fee. The referendum is not bind
ing, but the results, if validated at the 
April 8 Senate meeting, will be used as
a measurement of student support for 
the deal.
If the results are validated, the reso
lution will be made public and given to 
Dean [of Student Affairs Michael] 
Murphy and the Board of Trustees, 
said Sarah Gross, student body presi
dent and junior history major. The 
resolution is an indicator of student 
opinion. Anyone who wants to take a 
look at it can use the results. The Board 
of Trustees must approve any tuition
and fee increases levied against stu
dents Gross said that elections may be 
deemed invalid due to technicalities. 
For example, she said, if Senate found 
evidence that students were voting mul
tiple times in an election, it would in
validate the results.
The deal, which according to Gross 
has been discussed on and off at CMU 
for about eight years, will allow access to 
any PAT bus, shuttle, train, or special 
route. The initial agreement which the
administration is negotiating with PAT 
would last for five years and would begin 
on July 1, 1999.
There are people who dont agree with 
the referendum and I understand that 
they disagree with paying for something 
that they wont be using, said Gross. But 
overall, I think that it is something thats 
really good for the student body and Uni
versity.... This has been going on for a 
while, and a lot of people have worked very 
hard to come to a reasonable deal.Crime and Incident Report
4/2 CRIMINAL MISCHIEF,
7:07 am  Campus Police dis
patched an officer to Wean Hall 
to investigate a foul smell in a 
stairwell. Two officers and a se
curity guard went to the east 
stairwell and found approxi
mately 100 dead fish on the steps 
and ground floor. CPS was noti
fied for cleanup.
3/15 DEFIANT TRESPASS,
1:13 pm  A CMU student was 
taking a short shower in the Uni
versity Center mens locker room. 
After about a minute under the 
water spray, he stepped back to 
his locker to discover that some
one had rummaged through his 
bag. He saw someone who had 
been using a locker near him 
quickly walking away. He ap
proached the man and confronted 
him about the rummaging. The 
man said that it wasnt him; it 
was someone else. The building 
equipment manager detained the 
actor while the victim called Cam
pus Police.
The first officer on the scene 
took possession of the actor, seek
ing to identify him. The man pro
vided a Pennsylvania drivers li
cense. His name was found in 
CMU records, and he had been 
stopped two other times by CMU. 
police. He had been warned not 
to return to CMU property and 
was therefore subject to arrest 
for defiant trespass.
The actor was taken to the Pitts
burgh police department. During 
the ride, the actor moved fur
tively in the back seat, appearing 
to hide something under the seat. 
When the officers arrived at the 
police station, they checked un
der the seat and found a Univer
sity of Pittsburgh ID with a pic
ture of the actor pasted onto the 
original photo. He was turned 
over to the station for processing.
3/16 ASSAULT, 11:26 pm  A 
Campus Police dispatcher received 
a call from a CMU student. She 
said she saw three white males 
assaulting a fourth in the Roselawn
driveway. They were dragging the 
victim by his hair and punching 
him at the same time.
Three officers responded im
mediately, but they found no sign 
of the attack. In fact, it appeared 
quite normal. They asked several 
Roselawn residents if they had 
heard anything, but they said 
they noticed nothing at all.

LaPaglia reviews all reports prior 
to release.

FORUM
Carnegie Mellon University5 April 1999Improper planning 
hampers elections
For Student Government to 
function properly, students must 
be able to voice their opinions 
through the power of their vote 
in student elections. Without 
enough voters, Student Govern
ment cannot claim to truly rep
resent its constituents.
Unfortunately, this years elec
tions for student body president, 
treasurer, and Student Senators 
were poorly timed, poorly pub
licized, and poorly organized. 
The unofficial election results 
show that only 819 undergradu
ate students, or 16.8 percent of 
the undergraduate student body, 
voted. Even more striking is the 
fact that seven graduate stu
dents, or 0.02 percent of the 
graduate student body, voted. 
In total, 11 percent of the stu
dent body cast ballots in this 
years elections.
The elections were held at an 
inconvenient time  the week 
after spring break. As a result, 
candidates had insufficient time 
to publicize themselves or their 
viewpoints on issues that con
cerned them. Nextyear, the Elec
tions Board should set the elec
tion date for either before spring 
break or at least a week after 
students return.
The Elections Board itself was 
not approved by Senate until 
March 18, allowing little time to 
adequately prepare for the elec
tions. Petitions to run were due 
merely one week before elec
tions, delaying release of the fi
nal list of candidates until the 
Sunday after spring break. In 
the end, students were expected 
to make an informed decision in 
only a matter of days. Senate 
must strive to find candidates 
for the elections board and ap
prove it sooner. Doing so would 
provide more time to publicize 
elections as well as giving can
didates more opportunity to 
share their viewpoints with the 
student body.
Posting messages on 
the emu.misc.market and 
emu..student.government 
bboards and simply having a 
table outside Doherty is not ad
equate publicity for an event as 
important as student elections. 
Other groups frequently set up 
tables outside of Doherty, and 
the election tables were not even 
marked to indicate their pur
pose. In addition, the elections 
poll table was moved to the in
side lobby of Doherty on Thurs
day due to inclement weather, 
with virtually no notice to stu
dents except one message posted 
late in the day to 
emu.student.government. In or
der to get more students to vote, 
the board must poster around 
campus and announce elections 
via every possible means.
The election rules allow for the 
use of more than one polling 
table. Election organizers should 
take advantage of this by put
ting tables in separate locations 
to garner more votes. One con
cern with doing so is that it re
duces the ability to track who 
has voted and who hasnt; put
ting some colleges at one table 
and others at a second table 
would prevent such a situation 
from arising. Signs at each table
could direct voters to the appro
priate voting area for their col
lege; placing the tables in key 
locations other than in front of 
Doherty Hall would increase 
their visibility to appropriate 
constituents. For example, the 
table for Mellon College of Sci
ence and School of Computer 
Science voting might be located 
on the patio in front of Wean 
Hall, while Humanities and So
cial Sciences students might find 
their voting table outside the 
entrance to Baker Hall. Such 
positioning would make it more 
convenient for
students to vote  their table 
would be in a location they 
would pass on their way to 
class anyway.
Senate should also look into 
the possibility of allowing the 
board to conduct voting online 
as well as at tables, either 
through a Web site or using 
email. This practice is already 
employed by graduate students, 
and it would make it easier to 
make sure the elections 
are valid.
Communication issues regard
ing the legitimacy of campaign 
tactics must also be addressed 
next year. As a result of poor 
communication between the 
Elections Board and candidates, 
along with timing difficulties, 
few candidates postered plat
forms around campus. In ad
dition, the elections board must 
clarify publicity guidelines for 
candidates, and it must make 
sure that candidates are aware 
of these guidelines. One contro
versy that surrounded these 
elections was whether or not 
Greek organizations should be 
allowed to post signs and dis
tribute pamphlets containing 
the names of those candidates 
that were Greek. Currently the 
election rules mandate that 
Senate should decide by a twothirds vote whether a certain 
campaign tactic is fair. Because 
the elections were badly timed, 
Senate could not make such a 
call on tactics which caused con
troversy this year.
One positive step taken this 
year as well as last year was a 
question-and-answer session 
with candidates, which WRCT 
broadcast last Wednesday. But 
this was not enough to provide 
students with the information 
they needed, especially since 
many students had already 
voted by the time the session 
aired. More must be done next 
year to inform students about 
who is running, and elections in 
general. For example, Senate 
should post the platforms of can
didates on their Web site and 
publicize that. If students un
derstand the issues that are be
ing discussed by candidates, they 
will be more likely to vote.
In general, reorganization of 
student body elections must oc
cur next year to ensure that as 
many students as possible voice 
their opinions about the candi
dates. In order to increase the 
number of students who turn 
out to vote, Senate and next 
years Elections Board must take 
this year as an example to im
prove the process by which offic
ers and Senators are elected.

Letters to the Editor
Keynote speaker 
provokes debate
SHE'Editor:
I am writing in re
gard to the editorial in 
The Tartan regarding 
the lack of keynote 
speaker for comLetter to 
the Editor
mencement [Ceremony requires memo
rable speaker, March 15]. The adminis
tration here at Carnegie Mellon takes 
pride in many different aspects of cam
pus life. They applaud the achievements 
of faculty and staff, the national rankings 
of the University, and the high numbers 
of applicants each year. But they appar
ently do not take pride in the graduating 
senior class. What other explanation is 
possible for their disregard of the desire 
of the senior class for a keynote speaker?
Last year, a committee was formed to 
investigate commencement ceremonies 
and find ways to pare down the time
allocated for the ceremony. I agree 
that a three-hour commencement is 
far too long, especially sitting under 
the sun in Gesling Stadium. However, 
the administration ignored the sug
gestions put forth from the committee. 
In the course of benchmarking other 
universities of comparable size and 
reputation, all were discovered to have 
three speakers  usually the 
president of the university, a graduat
ing senior, and a keynote speaker  
and the hooding of doctoral candidates 
at their ceremonies.
Moving the hooding to the Saturday 
before commencement effectively re
moves the largest portion of the cer
emony. Why, then, does the admin
istration ignore the suggestion to keep 
a keynote speaker in the commence
ment ceremony? I can only suggest 
two possibilitieseither the administra
tion has a lack of respect for the sug
gestions, or pure laziness precludes 
a keynote speaker from this 
years commencement ceremony.
Carnegie Mellon has a rich history of 
distinguished alumni from which to 
draw. I find it hard to believe that find
ing a good keynote speaker would be 
that difficult of a task, had the search 
begun at an earlier point in time. A 
keynote speaker is not only a tradition 
upheld by almost every college and 
university, but it is an important aspect 
of graduating. It is difficult for other 
speakers to divorce themselves from 
the atmosphere of Carnegie Mellon 
and speak about life outside our sloping 
halls. A keynote speaker has that 
opportunity, and it is one that we 
should take advantage of.
I urge the undergraduates and gradu
ates of Carnegie Mellon to take a stand 
on this issue. It may be too late for the 
graduating class of 1999, but this mis
take can be rectified for future graduat
ing classes.

Jack Kevorkian is a sick, 
sick man. However, he is not 
a murderer  although Im 
quite sure a few people out 
there disagree with me, 
namely, the jury that 
finally convicted Kevorkian 
of second-degree murder on 
March 26 for the death of 
Thomas Youk.
First, let me clarify exactly 
whats behind the second-de
gree murder charge. To 
charge Kevorkian with firstdegree murder, the jury 
would have had to decide that 
the death was intentional 
and planned. To charge him 
with second-degree murder, 
the jury only had to decide 
that he intended to kill or do 
great bodily harm to Youk 
 which was a pretty simple 
decision after Kevorkian 
broadcasted videotapes of the 
deadly injection on CBSs 60 
Minutes, giving 15 million 
people the repulsive privi
lege of watching Youk in his 
final hours. And did we watch
Kevorkians disgusting docu
mentary? You bet. Millions of us 
gathered around our televisions 
on September 17, 1998 to see 
exactly what he does for a living.
While the tapes may have been 
intended to give us the patients 
perspective, to visually display 
Youks consent and relief, they 
just fired up Kevorkians en
emies. David Gorcyca, the pros
ecuting attorney in the trial, told 
the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, 
Dr. Kevorkian has even begged 
and sometimes taunted me into 
prosecuting him. On March 26, 
a jury of his peers granted him 
his ultimate wish.... The verdict
stands to the sanctity of hu
man life and a validation of 
the jury trial system.
If you ask me, the verdict 
stands as an easy way to deal 
with a subject that makes us 
very uncomfortable, as well 
as the man who keeps throw
ing it in our faces. I cant help 
thinking that the jury threw 
Kevorkian in jail because he 
disturbs us, not because we 
truly believe he is a murderer. 
Maybe its because Ive never 
before known murder to be 
consensual. The truthis, most 
of us cant imagine the pain

Not too long ago, a lot of people began 
to get excited about new technologies 
that allowed average citizens to exchange 
staggering amounts of information with 
each other. Words like freedom and 
equality were thrown around more of
ten than usual, and it was often implied 
that only religious zealots and ThirdWorld dictators would turn up 
their noses at such fantastic 
gifts. But just look at whats 
happening now, as MP3s 
(chunks of CD-quality music 
shrunk to a size that a conven
tional modem can handle) be
come the focus of enormous 
resistance from the music in
dustry. Shady consortiums of 
manufacturers, distributors, 
and publishers are sprouting 
like fungi, firing off barrages 
of lawsuits, and prompting a 
nationwide wave of piracy ar
rests. The worlds retailers of 
intellectual property have been 
complaining about the digital 
domains threat to their rev
enues for years now, but why 
has this latest threat triggered
such a drastic response?
I think its because, to get other kinds 
of copyrighted material into the com
puter, you have to put some effort into it. 
For a long time, if you wanted to put new 
words on the screen, you had to type 
them in yourself, and it still takes time 
and experience to use an image or text 
scanner properly. Fortunately, in the 
case of copyrighted music, the industry 
has already done the work for us, spread
ing around enormous quantities of digi
tal music in the form of CDs. Turning
Cory Shopper/Tartan Art Staff
one kind of digital material into a differ
ent kind is something the computer can 
do all on its own; to change CD music 
into ready-to-travel MP3s, you only have 
to aim at the right software and click. 
Automated mass production and distri
bution becomes possible for anybody  
and its faster and more efficient than 
the methods of the industry itself. In
stead of a mere revenue drain, MP3 
music is a genuine competitor.
The current sense seems to be that the 
ascendancy of the MP3 format is a phe
nomenon thats somehow in
evitable. Magazines like 
Wired suggest that the music 
format has gone too far to be 
controlled, tapping into the 
general feeling that something 
as big, chaotic, and free as the 
Net cant be tamed by a gang 
of antiquated petty bureau
crats. Much has been made of 
the fact that digital material 
can transcend the constraints 
that bind physical matter  
it can be infinitely duplicated, 
seamlessly altered, and glo
bally distributed in the space 
of an instant. Unfortunately, 
anyone whos had a hard drive 
die on him or her is aware that 
these phantoms are a lot more

Editors Notebook

Now that Room Draw is over, most 
students can breathe a sigh of relief. 
They know where theyre living next 
year, so they can devote their worries to 
more immediate concerns. But some stu
dents are just gearing up for an evenmore-exciting ordeal  that of trying to 
find summer housing in Pittsburgh. They 
may be taking summer classes or work
ing at a job or internship, but they need 
somewhere to stay. While CMU offers 
resources for students needing summer 
housing in Pittsburgh, it could give stu
dents even more help.
CMU does open Morewood Gardens to 
students during the summer. And it 
does let students currently living in 
Amberson, Fairfax, and Webster apart
ments stay in them. But it could better 
serve its students if it offered more op
tions, or at least made it easier for stu
dents not currently living in a campus 
apartment to get one for the summer. 
And its not just a matter of giving stu
dents more space to spread out their CD 
collections and computer paraphernalia
than a typical Morewood double would 
allow. Its a matter of food. Morewood 
has one kitchen for all 708 of its resi
dents, which is fine during the school 
year when students dont have much 
need of the kitchen because they can 
easily get food elsewhere on campus. 
But in the summer, most of the campus 
food vendors either are completely closed 
or have shorter hours, 
so students remaining 
on campus need to de
pend more on cooking 
for themselves. Which is 
why the option of living 
in a kitchen-equipped 
campus apartment 
would be nice to have.
Last year, Fairfax 
apartments were avail
able for the summer to 
any student who wanted 
one. This year, Fairfax, 
along with Amberson 
and Webster, are only 
available to current resi
dents and their desig
nated roommates. But 
why not open them up to 
any students who are willing? There 
may not be many takers, but at least 
students who want something with space 
and a kitchen and dont have time to find 
a sublet will have that option. Since
applications are due April 16, which is pretty 
soon, Housing would even have had enough 
time to offer any unoccupied apartments for 
rent to conferences or do whatever else they 
want with them.
So students who want to stay in Pitts
burgh but dont want to be condemned to a 
Morewood double for the summer need to 
find off-campus housing. Here, too, Housing
and the campus community as a whole offer 
useful help but could do more.
You can try finding somewhere to 
live via the bulletin boards 
emu.misc.market.apartments and
netnews.pgh.apartments, but its a pain to 
wade through all the postings, especially 
when some of them arent informative 
enough for you to even get a sense of whether 
the place meets your needs.
The Community Housing Office offers a 
more systematic way to find a house or 
apartment. It maintains a searchable data
base of available housing. Each listing in
cludes not just the 
address and rent but 
other relevant infor
mation like whether 
the place is furnished 
and how far it is from 
campus. This site is a 
great resource that

Hey Josh, I want to watch 
Pokemon.
Mom said Im in charge, so 
were watching Batman!
Come on....
Shut up! Go play with your 
stupid dolly!
Ill get you back, Joshua 
Miller!Mary Lou ran to her room, 
crying. Suddenly, she remem
bered what one man did on TV 
last night....
Josh saw the reflection of Mary 
with the Uzi on the TV screen. 
Mary, what are you doing?
I want Pok&mon, not 
stupid Batman! Mary pulled 
the trigger.
Hi, Im Jack Miller, father, 
salesman, and sportsman. The 
scene you just witnessed happened
this year in my household. This 
accident could have been easily 
prevented. Not by banning guns, 
you liberal puke! Thats ridicu
lous! But if Mary had taken a 
three-hour NRA course in gun 
safety, it would never have hap
pened. Remember, kids, you kill 
commie gooks with guns.
I dont know if anyone can take 
the NRA seriously anymore. 
Their arguments for gun owner
ship lean towards meaningless 
and polemical rhetoric, exempli
fying the unprincipled conserva
tism in America today.
Most NRA contention draws its 
backing from the second amend
ment, our right to bear arms. 
This is completely unprincipled. 
Im not talking about the second 
amendment being outdated. I 
mean that the NRA is simply 
silly. We have quite clearly wit
nessed, with recent events in Iraq, 
Sudan, and now Yugoslavia, that 
if our government wants to op
press people, it uses cruise mis
siles and airstrikes. If the gov
ernment really wants to oppress 
your little militia, all the auto
matic weapons in the world wont 
help against missiles launched 
out of ships in Hudson Bay. Be
sides, why restrict your right to 
bear arms to antipersonnel fire
arms? Arms is defined as any 
weapon, offensive or defensive. 
The nunchaku I own are widely 
illegal as street weaponsI dont 
see the NRA opposing those laws. 
Also, why arent they clamoring 
for the right to own rocket launch
ers and cruise missiles of their 
own? At least if they were 
equipped with modern arms the 
militias might stand a chance if 
the government actually decided 
to oppress us. Dont just arbi
trarily use the second amend
ment as a cover for repressed 
gun-shaft desires.
And so, given the incidences of 
inner-city and schoolyard gun
play, there is much sentiment 
against guns and, by extension,
NRA policy. But such schoolyard 
killings have indicated a need 
not so much for gun control, but 
just generally for a lower amount 
of gun availability. With more 
guns are around, its easier for a 
disturbed individual to obtain and 
use one. So lets go to a direct 
solution of the problems symp
toms. Guns are a problem be
cause of their presence  easy to 
get means easy to use.
Thus, lets completely ban guns 
in areas with a population den
sity greater than that of the aver
age suburb. Theres a lot of stress 
associated with living in a city, 
especially a big one. Well give 
our police the power to completely 
crack down on guns in areas with 
a greater population density than 
that of suburbs  but in order to 
keep them from oppressing us, 
moving to the country will allow 
someone to keep their guns. Mili
tias will be able to keep their 
guns. Live in the country, hunt 
for your food, thats all okay. But
no guns in the city.
The argument can be made that 
the right to bear arms was formu
lated only with notions of the 
society at that time, with no con
ception of todays mass socialist 
city. Thus, one might argue that 
such a right should only apply in 
situations akin to those known to 
the framers of the Constitution: 
in a low population-density envi
ronment. The modern-day city is 
a20th century phenomenon; lets 
have new laws for new situations. 
What could be more conservative 
than conservation? We can re
serve large rural regions called 
reservations for would-be gun 
owners and other conservative 
militia groups, where they will be 
free to live according to the old 
ways. With the savages out of the 
way, America can move forward 
into a new and civilized future.
Yishan Wong says BrittanyErin-Powell is great because she 
made enough gazpacho for all.U.S., NATO involvement in Kosovo conflict should end
Adam Retchless
A simple man would probably think 
that the best method for securing peace 
in a society would be to avoid aggravat
ing his neighbors except when it is unde
niably necessary. Unfortunately, this 
common sense seems to elude President 
Clinton and the executives of many other 
NATO states.
While the plight of the Kosovar Alba
nians may sadden us, we must remem
ber that our political relationship with 
these people is not a relationship be
tween individuals, but rather a relation
ship between states. Neither they nor
we desire to be united under one politi
cal system. Since this is the case, we 
have no responsibility  indeed, we 
dont even have the right  to use vio
lence to protect them. What we do 
have the responsibility and right to 
do is to individually open our pocketbooks to provide the refugees with 
humanitarian aid and collectively 
open our borders so that refugees 
may emigrate to a land where their 
rights as individuals are respected.
Responsible members in- a soci
ety of sovereign states have only 
the right to protect their own borders 
and the responsibility to respect the 
territorial integrity of their fellow states. 
With the initiation of bombing runs over 
Yugoslavia, NATO has finally become 
an aggressive force, leaving behind the 
innocent status of defensive alliance it
has occupied for so long. On our behalf, 
President Clinton has violated the sover
eignty of Yugoslavia, igniting popular and 
official outrage in Yugoslavia, neighboring
The worst aspect of this 
assault is that there is no 
well-defined, stable out
come that we are seeking.
Macedonia, and even the regional powers of 
Russia and China.
What is so outrageous about our attacks 
on Yugoslavia is the arrogance required to 
launch them given the current state of in
ternational opinion. Unless the national 
security of the US or its allies is undeniably
threatened, we should only attack another 
country with near unanimous international 
approval. Otherwise, such unprovoked at
tacks against sovereign nations will 
threaten our neighbors and probably 
contribute to arms races and 
antagonistic foreign policies.
The arrogance in Washington has 
been exhibited even further by the 
shock expressed in response to the capty ture of American troops and the stepped 
up ethnic cleansing in Kosovo. Appar| ently, NATO commanders didnt even 
consider the possibility that Yugosla
via would resist our attempts to dictate 
their form of government. Both of those 
actions by the Yugoslavian military are 
reasonable, if risky, when viewed as at
tempts to end the NATO bombings with
out surrendering. If US citizens recognize

another screen before you get to 
the pertinent information. A 
small change in this database 
that wouldnt require much time 
or effort for Housing would really 
help students  let them search 
listings by dates of availability in 
addition to everything else.
The Community Housing Of
fice also has assorted other re
sources to aid you if you want to
move off campus, including a list 
of landlords who rent to students, 
crime statistics for neighborhoods 
near CMU, and hints about what 
to look for in a house or apart
ment. While this information is 
certainly as useful for someone 
searching for a summer sublet as 
it would be for a student looking 
for school-year housing, itd be 
even more helpful if it were 
teamed with improved Web list
ings that let students easily locate places for the summer.
With the search for summer 
housing made easier, students 
can turn to other things. Like 
finding the summer jobs that 
will let them actually afford 
housing in the first place.

our governing bureaucrats are firmly in control. 
For example, according to some accounts, 
Afghanistans Taliban has devised a low-tech but 
effective method of Net censorship. If they find 
people in possession of a modem, theyre immedi
ately sentenced to death.
My point is not that it could happen here, but 
that it can be done. Its said that the Internet cant 
be censored, but you could make the same claim for 
mass-produced works in general. Purge as much as 
you want, but more often than not a few copies will 
escape destruction. Even back in the days of hand
written books, the imperial Catholic Church 
couldnt wipe out the original, unexpurgated writ
ings of the ancient Greeks, and they had almost 
500 years to work in. But in the short term, it didnt
matter. You dont need to annihilate something 
utterly to censor it; you only need to scare people, 
scare them enough so that they wont ever go 
near it. Would the average CMU MP3 pack rat 
work so hard to give Human Behaviour and the 
theme from Dune immortality, knowing that 
theyd be sent to prison for 15 years if they were 
caught? While the storm troopers wont likely be 
coming for your toys anytime soon, the right 
political climate could spawn a War on Intellec
tual Property Theft that, like the War on Drugs, 
would send a lot of undeserving people to jail for 
a very long time. Thirty years ago, nobody saw 
that one coming either.

"Will this war allow Milosevic to

Kosovo would be 
irrelevent. What 
type of person 
thinks he can get 
into a fight and com
pletely control the 
situation?
The worst aspect 
of this assault is 
that there is no welldefined, stable out
come that we are seeking. It is not as though we 
are fighting to preserve an established, demo
cratic state. The only goal is to stop Yugoslavian 
atrocities against the Kosovars. But what will 
exist once Yugoslavia is weakened? Will the 
Kosovo Liberation Army fill the power vacuum 
and commit atrocities against Serbs, just as 
Croats and Muslims did in Bosnia as soon as they 
had the chance? Will the new government of 
Kosovo respect the equal rights of individuals, 
or will it be just as dictatorial as Yugoslavia? 
And as for Yugoslavia, will this war allow 
Milosevic to tighten his hold on dictatorial
ages the cen
tralization of 
power, the fear 
of differences, 
and the gen
eral loss of1 
rationality. As; 
such, war is 
only justified 
as a last resort 
to protect the
very existence of a state; never as a tool of 
economic policy. By attacking Yugoslavia with
out a compelling interest of protecting our 
own freedom, the U.S. is committing 
an injustice as grave as those that it 
claims to seek to end by intervening, and, 
risks becoming like the enemy we seek, 
to destroy.

I thought the half-milers did 
pretty well.... [Senior] Jonathan 
Stein, who was conference cham
pion in the javelin last year, had 
a good performance, Meckley 
said. All in all, I thought we did 
pretty well, but we couldve done 
better since we dont have the 
depth we used to have.
Other key performers for the 
Tartans included junior Ryle 
Goodrich, who placed in the 1500- 
meter run, and senior Alice 
Chong, who was fourth in the 
hammer throw.
There was some really good 
competition.... For me at least, it 
was nice to be able to watch ath
letes who can throw very far so
that I can learn from them, 
Chong said.
After practicing for so long in 
the Pittsburgh cold, the warm 
weather last weekend was a 
mixed blessing for the com

would provide us with the feel
good stories we enjoy so much, 
but also allow us to see competi
tive, quality basketball through
out the tournament. One 
Cinderella that I think deserved 
to get as far as it did is Gonzaga. 
They proved throughout the tour
nament that they were under
rated and not out of place in the 
Elite Eight. What happened in 
that game was perfect. They gave 
Connecticut a scare, gave the fans 
something to talk about, yet in 
the end they couldnt hold on. 
And its a good thing, for had they 
held on, we may have seen a DukeGonzaga final, which would have 
been interesting, but not nearly 
as high-quality and fun to watch 
as the actual championship was.
Cinderella teams make the 
NCAA tournament what it is. 
There are no seven-game series 
like in the NBA playoffs, so the 
best teams do not always win. 
Cinderellas keep the tournament 
unpredictable and entertaining, 
and the upsets will not cease any
time soon. However, like any good 
guest, they need to know when 
its their time to leave the party 
and allow us to watch excellent
pete yet again, and the L.A. 
fans will expect results which 
havent come in a couple years. 
The slightest slip by newlyacquired pitcher Kevin Brown 
will have the faithful 
calling for his $ 105-million 
head, as well as that of 
the ownership.
The playoffs should provide 
much more drama than the 
Yankees systematic march to 
the championship last year, but 
will most likely feature the 
same teams as the previous 
three postseasons. The NL race 
is too close to call, but right 
now the edge has to go to At
lanta for their consistency.
 Whoever comes out of 
N the central wont be
* . given much reJL  spect in the 
^ playoffs, but
JrV* the Braves 
had
Tennessee teams for their ticket 
to the round of 16. Gonzaga ad
vanced the furthest of all the up
starts, riding the shooting of 
Richie Frahm and the point guard 
play of John Stockton protg 
Matt Santangelo all the way to 
the Elite Eight.
Pulling for these teams is irre
sistible. What fun is there in see
ing teams such as Duke, North 
Carolina, Kentucky, Arizona, and 
UCLA advance deep into the tour
nament every year? Seeing lowseeded teams advance gives 
people new stories to hear, and it 
makes us feel good to see a team 
like Weber State knock off big 
bad North Carolina.
Despite all this, I have to say 
that all the upsets lessened the 
quality of play in the tournament. 
Sure, seeing Southwest Missouri 
State advance to the Sweet 16 
was neat, but it would have also 
been fun seeing Duke have to 
actually break a sweat to get to 
the Elite Eight. Miami of Ohio 
had a great run, but a KentuckyUtah battle, a rematch of last 
years title game, would have been 
more competitive. Theres a rea
son the teams are seeded as they
but if the Phillies are out of con
tention by the July trade dead
line, expect a number of contend
ers to make a major push to 
get a deal through. Cleveland in 
particular has been eyeing 
Schilling for some time, and could 
put together an enticing package 
of young talent, including utility 
man Ritchie Sexson who was 
spectacular filling in for the in
jured Jim Thome at the end of 
last season.
That brings us to the most ex
citing division in either league 
right now, though not because of 
the level of compe
tition among the 
teams. The 
Houston 
Astros
now have to catch themselves. 
Fans all over the country, not 
just in St. Louis and Chicago, will 
be expecting a repeat of last years 
unbelievable home run race, put
ting even more pressure on the 
two sluggers than last years con
stant attention. For anyone but 
McGwire, 70 home runs would 
certainly be a once-in-a-lifetime 
feat. Big Mac certainly has the 
ability to pro- duce those num
bers again, \
but fans ___
The Basketball Beat
by Pete Patterson
Despite this being the year of 
the upset in the NCAA tour
nament, the championship 
came down to two predic
table foes. There was no Gon
zaga, Miami of Ohio, or South
west Missouri State. Oklahoma, 
Weber State, and Temple were 
also long gone. The lone under
dog to make it to St. Petersburg 
for the Final Four, fourth-seeded 
Ohio State, bowed out in the semifinals. That left Duke and 
Connecticut, the only two teams 
to be ranked number one in ei
ther the AP or coaches poll the 
entire regular season, to battle it 
out for the national title. The 
scenario couldnt have been any 
better, as the two teams showed 
they were definitely the best in 
the country.
James Mojonnler/ Tartan Art Editor
remain the best of a mediocre 
group of teams, but with All-Star 
'outfielder Moises Alou gone for 
the season they shouldnt be able 
to pull too far out of reach. The 
Chicago Cubs, last years wild
card team, should provide a 
strong challenge, but have also 
rbeen hit by the injury bug, losing 
Msecond-year ace Kerry Wood to 
Jigament damage.
, Underdogs who could surprise 
in this division are the Mil
waukee Brewers and the 
Cincinatti Reds. Both will try to 
disprove the growing theory that 
only big-market teams with exor
bitant payrolls can win, but will 
have a long road ahead of them in 
the process. Injuries to the divi, sion favorites obviously will help 
these two clubs, but it remains to 
be seen whether they can take 
advantage of others misfortunes.
Players to watch in the divi
sion, of course, need no introduc
tion. Having caught Roger Maris,
should not ^ \ 
begin expecting65a
season from r
him.
Finally, 
theres the NL West, where an
other wide-open pennant race will 
almost certainly develop. The de
fending NL champion San Diego 
Padres lost a number of key play
ers and will be hard-pressed to 
repeat this season. The Colorado 
Rockies remain an extremely tal
ented team that should challenge 
for the title, and the San Fran
cisco Giants can never be counted 
out as long as they have Dusty 
Baker running the bench.
Randy Johnson leads a plethora 
of great acquisitions for the Ari
zona Diamondbacks, but the second-year team just doesnt have 
the talent to compete yet. The 
most intriguing team to watch 
will be the Los Angeles Dodgers.
better not over-look 
them. The western cham
pion will have proven them
selves to be a true survivor 
that could follow the Padres 
trail to the World Series. By 
all indications, the AL race 
will come down to the Yankees 
and Indians for the third 
straight year. The AL west win
ner will be a talented team, but 
not in the league of either 
Cleveland or New York, and 
until someone proves other
wise, the Yankees are the best 
team in the league.

The Tartan, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania5 April 1999Track meet offers tune-up for new season
By MATT BRUN
Tartan Sports Editor
The resurfacing of Gesling Stadium 
hardly finished soon enough for the CMU 
track and field teams, who officially 
began the 1999 outdoor season last Sat
urday, April 2, by hosting the annual 
CMU Invitational.
During the period the stadium was 
closed for the renovations, the teams 
had to find alternate locations to prac
tice, a task which proved to be somewhat 
difficult, especially for the field events.
The pole vaulters are coming around 
now that we have a place to practice, 
mens head coach Gary Meckley said.
As well as providing a better running 
environment, the remodeled stadium 
gave a good impression of CMU to the 
teams who competed Saturday. Many 
of the visiting teams noticed [the reno
vations] and were impressed by it. I 
think that this new track may be a little 
faster, but Im not sure what they did 
with it, Meckley said.
As for the meet itself, invitations went 
out to a number of local schools, includ

Despite having only a minimal amount of training time due to the Gesling Stadium 
renovations, the CMU pole vaulters performed very well on Saturday.
ing Allegheny College, Indiana Univer
sity of Pennsylvania, and the University 
of Pittsburgh. The competition was 
pretty good, Meckley said. I think there 
were 17 mens teams there.
When scheduling the event, the inclu
sion of a big-name Division I school 
was important to up the ante on the 
competition. We didnt have as many 
competitors as in the past because of 
Easter weekend.... The fact that the Uni
versity of Pittsburgh was there helped, 
Meckley said.
The setup for the meet was rather 
informal, as no official results were kept, 
allowing the teams to mingle a bit and 
relax some. Despite the camaraderie, it 
was all business on the track. Every 
competitor took the meet as seriously as 
if it were a late-season battle. The in
tense competition allowed the Tartan 
runners to judge their level of fitness 
aginst other athletes in the same shape.
Both CMU teams showed a bit of rust, 
but still turned in a number of outstand
ing individual performances. We defi
nitely had some bright spots for our first 
outdoor meet of the spring, womens 
head coach Dario Donatelli said.
As expected, the best results came 
from the distance squads. For the women, 
seniors Margaret Powers and Maureen 
McGranaghan won the 3000-meter and 
5000-meter runs, respectively, with firstyear Brooke Cutler finishing as runnerup to McGranaghan. The exacting disStacey Tetzlaff/Tartan Photo Staff

their results particularly impressive, 
despite their high finishes. Although I 
thought that many of the distance kids 
ran well, many of them were disap
pointed with their times, Donatelli said.
Senior Kristopher Kriechbaum won 
the steeple chase for the men, edging out 
juniors Jim Gorham and Eric Egenolf, 
who also placed. Juniors Ken Oldham
Oldham took second in the 5000-meter 
run, while Knudsen finished third in the 
800-meter run.
I was pleased with how I ran since it 
was the first meet of the season, 
Knudsen said. Its often hard to do 
well after spring break, but I think I 
ran well.

Tennis teams use spring break to hone skills
By BRIAN SMITH
Tartan Special Projects Manager
The unseasonably warm 
weather last week was a pleas
ant welcome home for the mens 
and womens tennis teams, who 
spent spring break training in 
the sun of South Carolina. The 
trip featured a number of matches 
against some of the top teams in 
the region and was a chance for 
the Tartans to further prepare 
.for the spring seasons ultimate 
' goal  the University Athletic 
'Association (UAA) Champion
ships at Case Western Reserve 
University April 23-25.
We played well versus a lot of 
ranked teams, said head coach 
. Peter Moss. It was a team effort 
, on both ends.
The teams seasons did not start 
with the spring break training 
, matches, however. On February 
.21, the Tartans faced their first
 UAA opponents of the season, 
traveling to Cleveland to face 
Case Western. The women racked
up a decisive victory 7-2, while 
the men were not as successful, 
losing 5-2.
[The win over Case Western] 
helped us out a lot because 
we dont get to play a lot of 
UAA teams, said senior AllAmerican Keri Mills. It was a 
confidence builder.
Once in South Carolina, how
ever, the mens fortunes turned 
around. After dropping their first 
three matches, the Tartans re
bounded and won the next three 
versus the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater, The College of 
Low Country, and Bowdoin Col
lege. Ending the trip on such a 
strong note was a testament to 
the teams mental toughness. 
Rather than write off the trip 
after losing three straight, the 
team regrouped and showed what 
its capable of when playing at its 
absolute best.
The 3-3 record was all the more 
impressive considering the men 
were playing with a shortened 
squad. Our number two and
three men rejoined the team af
ter spring training after missing 
training due to academic rea
sons, said Moss.
The women enjoyed similar re
sults in Carolina, losing four but 
gaining a dominant victory over 
Mills College (9-0) and a critical 
win versus regional rival Massa
chusetts Institute of Technology 
(MIT) on March 24 (6-3). Like 
the men, the women got off to a 
slow start, but the win over MIT 
went a long way towards making 
up for lackluster performances in 
the early matches.
The MIT win was important 
because they were ahead of us in 
the regional rankings, said Moss.
I think that everyone started 
playing better toward the end 
of the week, said Mills. There 
were definitely a lot of matches 
we could' have won; we may 
have been a little nervous early 
in the week.
Now back from training, the 
teams have a singular concrete 
goal in mind for the rest of the
season. Both the mens and 
womens squads are looking to 
prove themselves in the UAA 
Championships at the end of 
the season. Achieving this goal 
will require improving on the in
consistency both teams have 
shown so far, but with plenty of 
matches left to play, the overall 
outlook is optimistic.
We try to take the whole 
season into consideration, said 
Moss. Im looking forward to 
UAAs.... The womens team is 
more experienced than any 
team Ive had, and were at 
full strength.
The Tartans have a number of 
matches left, including a womens 
match versus the University of 
Pittsburgh on April 13 and a trip 
to Muhlenburg University on 
April 11 for both teams. The next 
mens match will be on Tuesday, 
April 6, at Robert Morris College.
I would like to see us finish 
better in the UAA than last year, 
said Mills. I think we could fin
ish in the top four or five.

W^. oF
Play Ball
by Matt Brun
How do you top the greatest year in 
the history of sports? Almost every ma
jor sport had some special event or story 
line in 1998, but it was major league 
baseballs blessed season that captured 
the nations attention. With opening 
day upon us, here are the stories, teams, 
and players to watch as the encore gets 
under way.
The American League East is clearly 
' the New York Yankees division to lose,
. and the odds of that happening are slim 
and none. The only major roster change 
from the team that won a record 114 
games last season was the acquisition of 
the only five-time Cy Young Award win
ner in history, Roger Clemens. Dont 
' expect the rest of the division, especially 
Boston and Baltimore, to roll over and 
concede the title to New York, but, bar
ring an incredible Yankee collapse, the 
best they can hope for is a wild-card 
berth in the playoffs.
Developments to keep an eye on in 
this division revolve around a number of
key roster changes. Mo Vaughns depar
ture from Boston leaves a gaping hole in 
the Red Sox offense. Nomar Garciaparra 
will be expected to fill the void, but hes 
going to need help. Unless someone steps 
up to help out, Bostonians can look for
ward to watching some other teams play
ing in October. In Baltimore, the change 
to note is the arrival of media darling 
Albert Belle. Despite being one of the 
most consistent power hitters in the 
90s, Belles off-field antics made him 
expendable to both the Indians and 
White Sox, both of whom let him go 
through free agency. His bat will pro
vide some much-needed pop in the Ori
oles lineup, but his explosive personal
ity could quite easily clash with the 
traditionally mellow clubhouse led by 
the classiest player in the game today, 
Cal Ripken Jr.
If any team has an easier route to the 
postseason than the Yankees, its clearly 
the Cleveland Indians. As the only bigmarket team in the AL Central, the 
Indians havent been in a pennant race 
during any of their four straight division 
titles, and this year should be no differ
ent. With second baseman Roberto 
Alomar joining brother Sandy this past 
off-season, the Indians field a lineup 
more than capable of overcoming the 
suspect starting pitching. Come playoff 
time, however, the lack of a true ace 
could prove to be too much of a hin
drance to overcome, as shown in last
years league championship series and 
the 97 World Series.
Of the would-be challengers to the 
Indians, the Kansas City Royals, com
ing off the best spring-training record in 
the league, seem to have the best chance, 
but it would take an incredible turn
around to unseat the Indians. Outside 
Cleveland, no team in the division fin
ished the 98 season above .500, and the 
talent difference is just too great.
After the White Sox publicly conceded 
the title to the Indians in early July, 
they resigned themselves to rebuilding 
for the next few years, effectively remov
ing themselves from contention. If the 
Detroit Tigers continue the improve
ment they showed last season, it would 
be an amazing accomplishment. Unfor
tunately, the Tigers have too far to go 
from the abysmal season of two years 
ago to the level of the Indians.
Fans looking for a bit of drama in 
August and September will be particu
larly interested in the AL West, one of 
the most competitive divisions over the 
past few years. With the exception of the 
Oakland Athletics, every team in the 
division has either won a trip to the 
playoffs, or, in the case of.the Anaheim 
Angels, lost a one-game tie breaker. In 
each of the past three seasons, the An
gels have challenged hard for most of the 
season only to fall just short in Septem
ber. Prying Mo Vaughn away from Bos
ton was a great move that could very
well put the Angels over the hump and 
into the playoffs.
Another player to watch is Seattle 
Mariners outfielder Jay Buhner. Just a 
few short weeks after major ligament 
damage to his elbow, Buhner was al
ready back in the lineup. The rushed 
recovery could lead to a recurrence of the 
injury, which would be a major blow to 
the Mariners title hopes.
Not to be outdone by the junior cir
cuit, the Na
tional League 
will definitely not 
be lacking in ex
citement in 99.
In the East, the 
Atlanta Braves 
should once 
again ride per
haps the best ro
tation of all time 
to a division title, 
but it wont be a 
carefree trip.
With their roster 
at least tempo
rarily stable, the 
New York Mets 
should finally be 
able to keep up a 
consistent chal
lenge next fall.
Montreal and 
Philadelphia will 
most likely look
on from the periphery yet again, while 
the Florida Marlins continue the re
building process that began after the 
complete dismantling of the 97 world 
championship team.
The most intriguing story to watch in 
the division will likely be the future of 
Phillies ace Curt Schilling. Philadelphia 
management has said time and time 
again that Schilling will not be moved,

Speaking Out
An examination of the relationship 
between the student body, student 
government, and administration.
Students ponder government
STUDENT 
SENATE
By GREG NOFI
Tartan Contributing Editor
The purpose of Student Gov
ernment is to present the views 
of the student body to the facul
ty and administration.
While this objective is the 
last one mentioned in Section I 
of Article IV in the Constitution 
of the Student Body, it is cer
tainly not the least important. 
In fact, there are many stu
dents who are unfamiliar with 
the workings of their represen
tatives and the issues at hand.
One indication of this is a 
recent, campus-wide campaign 
by an anonymous source called 
the Morewood Prowler.
Posters and bboard postings 
urged students to vote for the 
Prowler as a form of protest.
[A vote for the Prowler] is a 
statement that you, as a mem
ber of the student body, feel you 
are not being represented. That 
those who are elected are the 
same kind of people who are 
always elected, and the
absolute last thing they have 
in mind when they vote is 
you, said a message posted to 
various newsgroups during 
the elections.
Even though the Prowler 
has been the most vocal on 
this issue recently, a large num
ber of students agree with 
this sentiment.
To me the Senate is like a 
sports team here  you dont 
really hear much about them, 
said Amy Crisostomo, a senior 
art major. Im a senior, and Ive 
had no idea what theyve done 
during my time here. I know 
theyre in charge of the Activi
ties Fee, but Ive never really 
known what theyve done 
for me.
Crisostomos statement is not 
an uncommon one among 
undergraduates. The only time 
I hear about my [Mellon Col
lege of Science] representative 
is around voting time. That 
doesnt make me feel so good 
about my representation, said 
Michael DeLeon, a junior 
physics major.
Many feel that it is this lack 
of communication that has cre
ated such a haze over the work
ings of Student Senate and the 
Student Dormitory Council 
(SDC). Before this concern 
can be adequately 
addressed, the first 
step is determining 
where this break
down in interaction lies. Is this 
a result of student apathy or 
representatives not keeping in 
touch with their constituents?
Earl Crane, a junior mechan
ical engineering major and 
SDC president, believes that 
the student body should be 
given the benefit of the doubt.
[When theres a communica
tion breakdown], the first place 
to look is the organization. If 
the students are not getting 
informed, then it is up to the 
organization to fix their side of 
the problem, said Crane.
SDC has plans this year 
to follow through on this, 
especially in their public rela
tions department.
I think [public relations] is 
an area where weve been lack
ing. Most people dont know 
what we do besides the Satur
day evening films, said Crane. 
Our plans include a more 
intensive newsletter, like the 
pilot one we had sent out this 
past year which was actually 
pretty successful.
Some undergraduates also 
feel that the internal structure 
of Student Senate can have an 
adverse effect on Senates 
external appearance.
Currently, the sen
ators represent a col
lege.... There arent many 
issues related to a specific col
lege. Theyre more universitywide related, like the PAT 
deal, said Dominic Falso, a 
senior physics major and sena
tor for MCS.
Representatives also point to 
a problem with student 
body interaction. Right now, 
there are several different ways 
in which senators are commu
nicating with the con
stituents they represent
I try to be active on 
the main campus 
bboards Where issues 
are being discussed, 
said Marcin Jeske, a 
sophomore computer sci
ence major and School
to them. Meetings 
are big, but a lot 
of people are too 
busy to attend 
them, said 
Sarah Gross, a 
junior history 
major and student 
body president. Email is also an excel
lent method since
everyone checks their 
e-mail. I am able to 
e-mail the RAs 
and SDC and 
have them 
contact their 
residents.
Falso has
observed the varying 
success that the 
plethora of communication 
methods has
Leaders strive to improve links
of Computer Science 
senator. Whenever I 
talk to people, 
which is some
thing I do all the 
time, I try to 
bring up their 
opinions on stu
dent govern
ment affairs 
during courses 
of the talks. 
Office hours are 
great, but not that 
many people show up
produced and 
believes that 
it is impor
tant for all 
student gov
ernment rep
resentatives 
to learn which 
ones work.
When you first come in 
as a senator, the focus 
is more on being pro
ductive in your com
mittee meetings rather 
than staying in touch 
with your constituents.... 
[While] you can see examples of 
such production during a Sen
ate meeting, youll never be 
given something that tells you 
how to keep in contact with 
your constituents, said Falso. 
I think if someone were to 
make that the primary discus
sion at a meeting, that would 
help out a lot.
Nevertheless, the leaders of 
Student Senate and SDC are 
optimistic about next year 
because they feel that an 
increased interaction between 
student organizations will ben
efit communication with the 
student body.

The link between the 
administration and student 
government is instrumental in 
the constant dialogue between 
the students and the adminis
tration. Through many 
monthly meetings between 
various student government 
and administrative commit
tees, these two bodies attempt 
to resolve issues that they feel 
are most important to the stu
dent body
My experience [with the 
administration] has been very 
positive, said Tim Rogers, 
president of the Graduate Stu
dent Association (GSA). This 
is an evolving relationship. 
Rogerss organization, along 
with Student Senate and the 
student body president, form 
the primary components of 
what is broadly known as Stu
dent Government. These orga
nizations, along with the Stu
dent Dormitory Council 
(SDC), are responsible for 
effectively relaying student 
comments and opinions to 
the administration.
Student Senate Chair 
Charles Anthe, Student Body
tration and Student Govern
ment is very positive.
The administration does 
make an effort to work with 
students, said Crane. He 
added that he felt that the 
administration sometimes
It will always be the case that 
some issues are not going to be 
resolved in a way everyone wants.  
Michael Murphy 
Dean of Student Affairs
President Sarah Gross, SDC 
President Earl Crane, and 
Rogers meet bi-weekly with 
Dean of Student Affairs 
Michael Murphy. I think its 
been useful. Its the most crit
ical forum [for me] where I 
hear what students are con
cerned about. Murphy added 
that he thought that the rela
tionship between the administends to lose contact with the 
student body. Student organi
zations and the administra
tion need to constantly evalu
ate [themselves]. Are they 
communicating in the best 
way possible?
The administration does 
not react as well as we [the 
students] want them to, said

Who helps decide on issues 
such as the PAT referendum 
and online course informa
tion? Who is involved in orga
nizing films on Saturday 
nights, or talking to the 
administration about issues 
facing students? Not many 
people know what goes on 
behind the scenes in 
Student Government and the 
Student Dormitory Council 
(SDC), though these organiza
tions meet regularly and pro
vide a valuable service to 
the university.
Student Government breaks 
up into three main bodies. 
Officially, the legislative 
branch, which includes Stu
dent Senate and Graduate 
Student Assembly (GSA), and 
the executive branch, which 
includes the student body 
president, vice president, and 
treasurer, represent the whole 
student body.
In addition, SDC repre
sents all students that live 
in campus housing 
and pay a dormito
ry fee.
Tartan Art Editor According to
Charles Anthe, a senior in 
electrical and computer engi
neering major and current 
chair of Student Senate, the 
main purpose of the governing 
body is to act as the voice of 
students on issues facing the 
campus and administering 
student organizations and the 
student activities fee.
Senate consists of represen
tatives from each undergradu
ate college. Each college has 
one Senate seat for every 
140 students in the depart
ment, and senators are chosen 
through general student 
body elections in the fall 
and spring.
The Senators convene every 
two weeks for meetings that 
usually last for at least three 
hours. The chair presides over 
the meetings, running 
through the weeks agenda 
and moving from one point of 
discussion to the next.
All Senators are members of 
one of Senates committees: 
Academic Affairs, Campus 
Affairs, Internal Affairs, 
Funding and Recognition, and 
Public Relations. Each com
mittee also has a chair; the 
committee chairs together 
with the chair and vice chair
of Senate form the Executive 
Committee (Ex Comm). Ex 
Comm regularly meets to dis
cuss issues that are not ready 
to be brought to the floor of 
Senate, such as the budgets of 
specific organizations.
Im much happier with the 
role that Senate is taking 
more than [last semester], 
said Anthe. Were meeting 
the needs [of students] much 
more clearly and efficiently.
While Senate faces the duty 
of representing the voice Of 
undergraduates, GSA con
cerns itself with issues facing 
graduate students on campus. 
At least one representative 
from each graduate depart
ment is elected internally, and 
afterwards attends a monthly 
meeting. Currently, there are 
about 40 representatives. The 
president of GSA serves as the 
main organizer of the group 
and is the main contact person 
for the administration when it 
is looking to find out how 
graduate students feel about 
an issue.
The president also works on 
several projects. Tim Rogers, a 
doctoral student in psychology 
and current president of GSA,

When the United States started 
research on nuclear weapons and 
nuclear energy earlier this century, a 
few people foresaw a future in which 
people would be threatened by the exis
tence of nuclear waste. Last Thursday, 
Jared Cohon, president of CMU and 
the chairman of the Nuclear Energy 
Technical Review Board, gave a speech 
on the issues surrounding nuclear 
power and policy.
Cohon began by explaining that 
today, the United States gets about 15 
to 20 percent of its total energy from 
110 commercial nuclear power plants 
the country. The closest nuclear power 
plant to Pittsburgh is in Beaver Valley.
A nuclear reactor works using 
nuclear fission. In this process a neu
tron is shot into a uranium (U-235) 
atom, splitting the atom into fission 
fragments, as well as new neutrons, 
which in turn crashes into other U-235 
atoms, thus starting a nuclear reaction 
chain, and away we go, said Cohon.
The fuel that goes into a nuclear 
reactor is mined as ore. This ore is 
milled into yellow cake, or uranium 
oxide. The yellow cake is refined 
and enriched into solid pellets of 
uranium dioxide.
These pellets contain 3 percent U235. The pellets of uranium dioxide are
packed into zirconium fuel rods which 
are dropped into the reactors core and 
drive the reaction.
The problem with this reaction is the 
fuel rods. By the year 1994, there were
30,000 metric tons of this radioactive 
nuclear waste in United States. 
Experts predict that by the year 2030, 
there will be about 85,000 metric tons 
of nuclear fuel rods lying around this 
country. Physically, thats not a lot of 
waste. But the fuel is now giving off 
much more radiation than is recom
mended by nuclear professionals.
In 1982, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act 
was passed. It established that two 
deep geological nuclear waste deposits 
should be built to conceal the nuclear 
radiation. Three locations were estab
lished as possible locations: Yucca 
Mountain, New Mexico; Hanford, Virgina near Washington state, and Deaf 
Smith, Texas. In 1987, it was decided 
that only one deposit was needed and 
that the most ideal site would be Yucca 
Mountain, New Mexico.
At the time, the vice president of the 
United States was George Bush, who is 
from the state of Texas; and the House 
majority leader was from Washington 
D.C, and Im sure that had nothing to 
do with the decision, said Cohon.
The nuclear waste problem, accord
ing to Cohon, is more of a public policy 
problem, than a scientific one.
The nuclear waste problem, I think,
is truly a result of technological arro
gance, Dr. Cohon remarked.
When the scientists first tapped into 
the wonder of nuclear energy, they ' 
considered the nuclear waste problem 
as none of the publics concern, not 
taking into consideration problems 
such as NIMBY (Not In My Back 
Yard), where people dont realize the 
extent of the nuclear waste disposal 
program and how close some of the
waste is to their homes. Since the halflife of these chemicals ranges from 
thousands to millions of years, it is 
hard to make decisions regarding 
their disposal.
If all goes well, the Yucca Mountain 
nuclear waste site should go into 
operation by the year 2010. But $ie 
problem of locating future deposit sites 
will haunt the society for centuries 
to come.

Rick McCullough, head of Chemistry Department, gives a hands on demonstration.
By JENN PELLECHIA
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
The past few months have been some 
of the most eventful in the history of the 
Carnegie Mellon Chemistry Depart
ment. Last semester, retired professor 
John Pople was awarded the 
Nobel Prize for chemistry, and, more 
recently, professor Terry Collins has 
developed a new method of bleaching 
certain materials.
To gain a better perspective 
on how these achievements affect stu
dents and the University, The Tartan 
spoke with Rick McCullough, who has 
been head of the chemistry department 
since July. %
The Tartan: Recently, a researcher in 
the chemistry department made a 
rather interesting discovery involving 
bleach. Can you describe what exactly 
was found?
Rick McCullough: Terry Collins, who 
is a member of our faculty, has found a 
way to use catalysts to activate the 
hydrogen peroxide in bleach, allowing 
it to do remarkable things. Using this 
new method, we can rapidly bleach 
dyes that get onto clothes without 
bleaching the actual clothes.
What this means is that if you threw 
your white sweater in the washing 
machine with a bright red pair of 
pants, the bleach would destroy any 
red dye that bled onto the white 
sweater without bleaching the 
red pants.
TT: So this makes it possible to mix 
colors and whites?
RM: Exactly. If the method gets 
patented, it will make doing laundry a 
whole lot easier. The other thing that it 
does is that it offers a new way to
bleach lignin, which is the brown sub
stance in wood, to make white paper. 
They use chlorine gas to get rid of 
lignin, which is very harmful to 
the atmosphere, but the use of the cat
alyst would provide a green way of 
producing paper.
Green chemistry [environmentally 
sound] has become extremely impor
tant, and whether Collinss discovery 
will turn out to be the environmentally 
correct answer to bleaching paper is 
something I dont know, but the results 
are certainly spectacular.
TT: Were any students involved in 
researching the bleach project?
RM: Yes, in fact, Terry Collins has a 
large group of undergraduates who 
were involved'in the bleach discovery 
and other projects. We think its really 
important to have undergraduates 
learning science that goes along with
todays technology.
We also have a new project coming up 
that will research new ways to make 
polymers. It should bring more 
research money into the University, 
which would allow even more under
grads to get involved.
TT: How has the department been 
affected by the fact that a former 
faculty member won the Nobel Prize 
for chemistry?
RM: The publicity has been amazing. 
John Pople was with the department 
for 35 years, and even though he is now 
retired and living outside of 
Pittsburgh, every member of our facul
ty has received telephone calls from 
newspapers and magazines asking 
for comments. Its been very exciting 
for everyone.
TT: Is it true that a lot of changes 
have occurred in the Chemistry
Department over the past decade?
RM: Definitely. In the last five or 10 
years, chemistry has really developed 
into a much more young, vibrant, 
dynamic department. We have some of 
the really leading scientists of today 
teaching here. Were actually one of 
the top 10 best schools for polymer 
chemistry, and were also really lead
ing the way in green chemistry. Weve 
always been a good department, tiut 
were working harder to achieve new 
levels. We have about 17 or 18 faculty 
members in the department, but wed 
like to have about 24 for a more inter
disciplinary focus. Right now, were 
interested in developing new ways of 
tissue engineering, which would 
involve students studying everything 
from biology to chemistry to electrical 
and computer engineering. It should 
bring in a lot of funding for under
graduate research, and what "it 
involves is growing in the lab tissues 
for bones that can then be used for 
a sort of futuristic regeneration 
of bones.
TT: Are you satisfied with tjie 
changes that have taken place, or 
would you like to see things go 
even further?
RM: One of the things I still hope to 
achieve is to somehow tell people on 
campus how good chemistry is at CMU. 
So far weve not been very good ambas
sadors; weve sort of just worried about 
whats been going on in the depart
ment, not what people think about u&
I think we should be reaching out 
more, and reminding people that chem
istry is cool. We are the only science 
that makes stuff that doesnt already 
exist. Were a creation science, and who 
knows what were going to do in the 
coming years?

Less Stress?
by Emily Landes
Unless my senses deceive me, it 
would seem that spring has sprung. I 
have mixed feelings about this season 
of renewal. Of course I love the fabu
lous jeans-and-a-t-shirt weather. I love 
to see the campus looking lively for a 
change. (Who are all of those people sit
ting out on the grass and throwing frisbees? Where are they the rest of the 
year?) And finally, I love to have 
classes outside.
'But it is that last love which makes 
spring a bittersweet season for me. Sit
ting outside in a circle, grass creeping
through the toes of my bare feet, dis
cussing philosophy and culture and 
other things that matter to me, while 
butterflies hover overhead, I am in 
heaven. Yet, as I sit out there I can't 
help but think to myself: This is what it 
would have been like if I had gone to a 
liberal arts school.
Yes, Carnegie Mellon was not my 
only option in higher education, and in 
fact it was the only non-liberal-arts 
school that I applied to. I went on tours 
at some of these schools and they 
showed me the history and English 
departments  the pride and joy of 
their universities, housed in eaved gin
gerbread cottages with couches and pil
lows on the floors of the airy class
rooms. The libraries tended to be ven
erable old brick buildings with a satisfyingly musty smell, where a cat 
named Alfred Prufrock, or some such 
tribute, wandered the stacks. The sci
ence buildings were large and ugly, as I 
think United States law indicates that
they must be, and we were hurried past 
them with a quick comment of, Oh, 
dont worry about that. Youll never 
need to go in there.
I came to visit CMU and I saw Wean. 
They showed me the library, which, 
with its boxy shape and aluminum 
bars, looked more like an absurdly 
large air conditioner. I was horrified.
But hidden behind CMUs build
ings/bomb shelters and these strange 
places that the tour guide called clus
ters, where it seemed that no one was 
ever happy, I saw a program that 
interested me and catered to my needs 
as a hopeful writing major, whereas at 
those other schools, I could only major 
in the much broader, and slightly 
more intimidating, subject of English. 
And so I came. For the most part my 
experience here has been excellent, 
and I feel as though I made a good 
decision. But every once and a while, 
like when I overhear two people hav
ing a conversation in numbers instead
of words, I cant help but think to 
myself, What if?
Here is how I picture my life differ
ently if I had not come to Carnegie 
Mellon: My hair would not be its nat
ural color. It would be pink or purple or 
something equally rebellious. I would 
have far more holes in my body than I 
currently do. I would have friends 
named Luke and Charity and we 
would have deep conversations at cof
fee houses where Molire, Brnt, and 
equally accented authors would be dis
cussed. I would never know that some
one somewhere had been sitting in 
front of their computer for 56 consecu
tive hours playing a bizarre and exces
sively violent game called Quake. My 
own computer would be no more than 
an expensive spiral notebook. People 
would call each other on the phone or 
even actually see each other instead of 
limiting personal encounters to imper
sonal modes of communication like 
email or ICQ.
Is it idealistic? Of course. My friends 
who go to such schools have told me as 
much. But that hardly matters. What 
matters is that when Im sitting outside 
in that spring air, feeling totally at 
peace with myself and my needs as a 
humanities student, I can only think -I 
bet this is what its like over there all 
the time. Sometimes I can almost trick 
myself into believing the illusion that 
scary places like Wean do not exist. . 
So when you see a group of students 
getting up after the end of a class out
side, and you think that I or someone 
who shares my sentiments may be 
among them, please do me a favor and 
keep the discussion of algorithms to a 
minimum. Let us keep our illusions

HISTORY, from page LI
indicated some of those that he 
was working on  child care for 
graduates, as well as restruc
turing the Skibo Coffeehouse.
Much like Senate, GSA con
sists of several committees such 
as the Social Committee, 
finance Committee, and Social 
Services, among others. The 
executive committee of GSA 
consists of the president, vice 
president, liaison officer, and 
treasurer, and meets on a regu
lar basis.
GSA used to be a subsidiary of 
Student Senate known as GSO, 
but it broke away about two 
years ago. Theres a lot of 
potential for growth. My goal 
this year is to make it easy for 
graduate students to partici
pate, said Rogers.
One consequence of the break
away was the formation of the 
Joint Funding Committee 
(JFC), which is made up of offi
cers that are two-thirds under
graduate students and onethird graduate stdents.
As a joint effort between both 
legislative assemblies, the JFC 
is responsible for reviewing stu
dent organization budgets that 
are submitted. Its been a 
very amicable relationship, 
said Rogers.
Sarah Gross describes being 
the president of the undergrad
uate student body as being a 
strong leader, leading others 
by example, and communicating 
\yith students. I have 
to take all the feedback I 
get from the students and 
reshuffle it [to communicate 
with] the administration.
lb get feedback, the president 
attends all Senate meetings and 
some GSA meetings in addition 
to her individual communica
tion with students. Anthe 
described the president as the 
point person for Senate, who 
goes out and talks with people 
and brings issues to Senate. 
Senates job is to take 
a step back  and be a little 
more deliberative.
In addition to the president, 
the executive branch includes 
the vice president, who is 
responsible for assisting the 
president when needed. The 
student body treasurer, works 
With student organizations and 
their budgeting when concern
ing the student activities fee.
SDC, though it does not rep
resent the whole of the student
body, represents a large con
stituency  the students who 
live on campus and in Universi
ty Oakland apartments. All stu
dents who pay the dormitory fee 
are general members of SDC. 
By receiving 25 signatures, a 
general member can become a 
petitioned member and have 
voting rights at SDC meetings. 
The president, vice president, 
and secretary/ treasurer head 
SDC. Currently, there are about 
150 active members, 35 of them 
petitioned members. Like the 
other governing bodies, SDC 
also has committees, such as 
Booth, Buggy, and a food com
mittee. Earl Crane, current 
president of SDC, said one 
thing that the organization does 
well is keeping in the forefront 
what the students want when 
making decisions. Also, he 
referred to the services that the 
organization provides, such as 
the Saturday night movies 
which almost 1,000 people 
attend every weekend, and the 
recreational equipment provid
ed in the dorms.
[Id like to] get all the actions 
that were doing out to stu
dents, said Crane. A lot of the 
good that were doing is 
unknown by the general stu
dent population.
How do all these organiza
tions work together? I dont 
think they work, said Gross 
referring to the relationship 
among the governing organiza
tions on campus. Specifically, 
she pointed out the relationship 
between SDC and Senate. She 
referred to the OLR resolution 
last semester as a good example 
of a joint effort, but feels that a 
couple of SDC representatives 
and Senators should get togeth
er regularly.
I will agree the communica
tion this year could have been a 
lot stronger, said Crane. He 
also added that right now Gross 
is the main way that the two 
sides come together.
I would agree that the presi
dent of the .student body is the 
first link I have to find the best 
way the two organizations 
can interact, said Crane.
Gross said she feels that Stu
dent Government is necessary 
part of the university. Its 
important to have a united 
voice. You cant have lines of 
students coming together in 
front of Warner Hall with 
their complaints.

ADMIN, from page LI
Raymond Thng, a junior elec
trical and computer engineer
ing major. He added that he felt 
that despite some shortcom
ings, the administration does 
seem to try to please students.
It is always going to be the 
case that some issues are not 
going to be resolved in the way 
everyone wants, but I am sur
prised that there is a feeling 
that individual issues were not 
addressed openly and directly, 
said Murphy. We do try hard to 
ensure that student voice is 
always heard and weighed in 
our decision making.
Gross, Anthe, Crane, and 
Rogers all felt that communi
cation between the student 
government organizations is 
essential in effectively com
municating student opinion to 
the administration. Gross was
the most vocal in her disap
proval of the way Student 
Government works. I want to 
look at restructuring Student 
Government, she said. Most 
[Senators] represent their 
friends and the people in 
their classes.
Student Senate is the first 
place the administration 
comes for feedback [from 
the student body], said Anthe. 
Indeed, because many Senators 
are apparently out of 
touch with their constituents, 
some people, like Gross, feel 
that student opinion can not be 
properly relayed to the admin
istration because of the 
current setup of Student Gov
ernment and its relationship to 
the administration.
Most Student Government 
leaders agree on Student Gov
ernments importance. There
is an advantage to structure, 
said Ronnie Fernandes, GSA 
liaison. We need to differenti
ate between essentials and lux
uries [so that the administra
tion is not overwhelmed with 
extravagant requests]. You 
cant ask for everything.
Students are unfair to the 
administration, said Gross, 
referring to debate over imple
mentation of the online regis
tration system (OLR). We cant 
expect OLR to work the best 
way. Gross added that she does 
expect more regular updates 
from the administration on 
what they are working on.
In the fall of 1998 Student 
Senate and SDC issued a joint 
resolution to Enrollment Ser
vices Department stating their 
concerns regarding OLR. John 
Papinchak, vice president of 
enrollment, last month refused
to comment on the condemna-; 
tion, and both Gross and Crane ; 
said they were unaware of 
any response from the;
administration. Crane was con 
cerned about the administra- , 
tions response.
Administrators need to; 
take an organizations sugges-) 
tions seriously, he said.  
Students would feel more com-; 
fortable using Student Govern-' 
ment if they knew that j 
their suggestions were being; 
taken seriously.
We are a young and ambi-; 
tious institution, and so none of j 
us are ever satisfied, nor should J 
we be, but we are also making: 
great strides, said Murphy?;: 
Student input and involve-: 
ment has been the greatest 
asset in our growth over the: 
past twenty years, especially in: 
campus life.

There has been somewhat of 
a disappointment in the past 
with a lot of people not knowing 
whats going on, said Jeske. A 
lot of the Senators are finally 
beginning to realize this and are 
starting to get more active and 
let the students know whats 
being done by their student gov
ernment.
If there was ever a year for 
the students to make a differ
ence because they want to see
something changed on campus, 
this is the year for that to hap
pen, said Crane.
Without feedback from the 
student body, however, the^ 
feel that their ability in 
getting things changed becomes 
much lower. Some students 
dont care and dont vote f<pr 
their representatives, and th$n 
they complain about some of tfce 
actions of Student Govern
ment, said Gross. Everybodys 
got to do their own part.

I had a good friend in grad school, he went by 
the name of Gen X. Some people thought he 
was a general, I knew he was a generation.
He had this one garishly yellow T-Shirt I 
remember so well. It had black text on the back 
that said "Our Gen. nds. a rev.". Well it didn't 
actually say it, shirts don't speak, but when you 
read it (like any text), you would say the words 
mentally in your head. Some people read aloud.
Gen X always told me his motto, "If you want it, 
flaunt it". Gen X always wanted a big booty, so 
he wore hot pants and adjusted his posture 
accordingly. Gen X told me about WWI and II, 
Vietnam, assassinations, hippies, and Watergate. 
I told him about Desert Storm, Clinton's affairs, 
Microsoft, and Pepsi. I wanted a revolution, so 
when Gen X passed away, I inherited his garishly 
yellow T-shirt. Upon putting it on I felt warm.

By rvl?Cr BivlCT
Tartan Assistant Diversions Editor
Its the beginning of an Italian opera 
about an epileptic janitor. The protago
nist wails away with spastic vibrato 
about the toils of cleaning up hideously 
filthy bathrooms and hallways. Just as 
the other performers are about to join in 
a rousing chorus, a deep voice booms 
from above, Number 81  Soup of the 
Da. Come get your order.
Such is the lot of the No Parking Play
ers (NPP), CMUs budding improv 
troupe, as they are forced to pander to 
their audience within the confines of 
Skibo Coffeehouse. However, the mem
bers of NPP are not thwarted by the poor 
acoustics, limited performance space, 
and rather untimely interruptions for 
food orders that are the unavoidable 
drawbacks of their arena.
If anyone can turn an impromptu your 
soups getting cold into a cause for hys
terics, NPP certainly can. In fact, such 
intrusions are almost welcome in the 
unpredictable world of improv.
As anyone in NPP will tell you, in the 
realm of comedy, improv is its own sepa
rate entity. Unlike stand-up comedy 
where one man or woman spews out 
scripted jokes to the crowd, improvisa
tion adds the elements of spontaneity 
and audience interaction to create an 
entirely different comedic experience.
Incompletely disregards the standard 
one-liners and bar jokes of rehearsed 
comedy by focusing on one of the most 
potent, yet under-exploited aspects of 
humor: the unexpected.
Improv is unlike anything else, said 
Kat Torrey, junior BHA major and
Grand High Poobah of 
NPP. It has a whole other 
set of operating rules.
Perhaps the only operat
ing rule of improv is that 
there are none. This noholds-barred type of com
edy allows its players to 
branch out into areas gen
erally untouched by most 
conventional comedians.
The members of NPP revel 
in this free ticket to mingle 
with insanity and often 
push it to the extreme.
You can do whatever you 
want to do, said Hunter 
Howe, a first-year English 
major. In normal everyday 
life, you dont get the oppor
tunity to be an egg shake 
man. Its a great creative 
outlet.
Egg shake men, agora
phobic Jeopardy contes
tants, mute aliens, dis
gruntled frogs. You name 
it, and a member of NPP 
has probably tried to emu
late it. It seems that the 
members of NPP will stop 
at nothing to bring their 
audience into convulsions.
Even if it means parading 
around as Ketchup Man.
You get a lot of suspen
sion of disbelief, said Joe 
Chellman, a senior psychol
ogy major. You can be the 
flying llama, and they buy it.
But the audience has only been buy
ing it for a relatively short time. NPP.
Brian Yeung/Tartan Photo Staff 
No Parking Players, CMUs own improvtroupe, performed last Friday 
night at Skibo Coffeehouse.
while founded in 1994, has only seen 
high numbers in both membership and 
show attendance since last fall. There
are generally about 10 to 
15 attendants at an NPP 
show who actually come to 
watch the program, and 
some others who had come 
to get some coffee and then 
stayed for the show. But 
each new show brings re
peat audience members, if 
not greater attendance.
Scotch n Sodas Viola
tors Will Be Towed, an 
improv show which played 
before Spring break and 
included many NPP mem
bers, had a good amount of 
people in attendance, even 
when one of the shows con
flicted with the popular 
Greek Sing.
Were bringing new 
people in each year, said 
Will Uther, a fourth-year 
graduate student in com
puter science. Its not just 
a performance group. Its 
going through a time of 
change.
This semester NPP was 
invited by Johns Hopkins 
University to do a show, a 
sign of notoriety which has 
many members both 
pleased with their 
progress and ambitious 
about the future.
After the Johns Hopkins [show], it;, 
occurred to us that there was a lot more; 
we could be doing, said Gus Prevas, a; 
first-year computer science major.
Many members would like to see some; 
more touring in their future, as well as ; 
competitions and other improv venues.;
There is a lot of potential, said; 
Torrey. Its just a matter of working; 
up to it.
While performing in an improv troupe 
may offer new opportunities for travel 
and greater recognition, the real reason 
why NPP even exists is because of its; 
members unwavering love for improv.: 
Many see past the superficial silliness of! 
their antics and view improv almost as 
an art form.
Humor [in improv] comes out from 
the fact that its more drama than comedy, said Uther. It involves interac-!; 
tions, conflict  its the scene over the / 
jokes. Continuing the scene is most im-!; 
portant and we almost try to teach you to ' 
not try to be funny. The punchline comes .; 
at the end of the scene, Uther said.
With a group of performers increas-! 
ing to record numbers, NPP will likely ! 
continue to expand in both size and! 
repute. They may still be shouting at! 
the top of their lungs to overcome the ! 
less than accommodating acoustics of 
Skibo Coffeehouse, but little could! 
likely stop NPP from bringing the hi- > 
larity of improv to an innocent unsus-1 
pecting audience.

Dirty, dark, and falling apart, 
the Pitt Theatre lacks the fea
tures of a thriving playhouse. 
However, every Friday at 11 pm, 
moje than 200 people pack its 
seftfcs and floor for Friday Nite 
Improvs (FNI).
l is an all-audience partici
pation comedy improv show, 
which means that for $2, anyone 
can get on stage and perform.
Improv games make up most of 
th show. Before each game, an 
P!P veteran explains the rules 
and; chooses volunteers to play.
The veteran 
asks the
all art this page by Nell Babra/Tartan Art Staff
audience for suggestions to begin 
the scene. The players must com
plete the tasks given until they 
resolve the scene.
Difficult? Yes. But FNIs house 
rules make sure that the rewards 
for volunteering outweigh the ef
fort. In the welcome rule, the 
audience claps for anyone com
ing on stage or leaving. The no 
booing rule threatens to make 
any heckler come on stage and 
perform and be at the mercy of 
the audience.
Ben Mayer, the host of FNI, 
graduated from the University of 
Pittsburgh Law School. He 
greeted us at the door. Ben has 
hosted FNI for six months, but he 
has attended FNI for the last six 
years. This weekend, Ben ex
pected few to attend due 
to the holidays. By 
10:30., however, the 
line at the door proved 
him wrong.
Gumball Willies AllStar Jamboree set up 
as Ben prepared 
the game list for 
the night. The 
FNI veterans en
tered to help pre
pare the Pitt. At 
10:45, the doors
opened. The band took re
quests and graciously played 
Free Bird. At 11, Ben be
gan the show.
He explained the rules of 
FNI and emphasized the fail
ure is okay rule: You could be 
more boring than this patch of 
mold and [the audience] will 
still clap for you! He then led 
the Improv Tip of the Week 
Players on stage to teach a 
lesson in improv skills. This 
week, they demonstrated de
nial of the obvious, a tactic in 
which one player denies an
other blatantly because it suits 
his characters purpose. They 
stress that the tactic is designed 
to make the suffering character 
the center of attention, not the 
player who denies him.
The audience played seven 
games that night. At midnight, the 
time-honored round of freeze be
gan, a game in which anyone who 
yells freeze may play. Afterwards, 
Gumball Willies All-Star Jamboree 
came back to play a set, and the night 
finished with two more games.
The Pitt Theatre is located off of Forbes 
Avenue, on Bouquet Street. For more infor

On Saturday night, the Elec
tronic Media Organization held a 
concert at the Connan Room in 
the University Center. The pur
pose of the show was to showcase 
the electronic music scene at 
CMU  not the D Js who play the 
music, but the students who are 
actually creating the music.
Six students performed at the 
concert, with a mixture of styles 
ranging from trip-hop and trance 
to jungle and experimental. While 
the phrase live electronic music 
would probably produce visions 
of people sitting in front of com
puters or keyboards and avoid
ing the audience, several produc
ers included live instrumentation 
in their sets, bringing an extra 
dimension into the sound.
First to perform was junior computer science student John
Sweeney, going by the name of 
Soulphistifunktication. His set 
featured several of his tracks 
pressed to vinyl, to facilitate mix
ing on turntables. While the per
formance itself was consistent 
with well-placed echoes and flow
ing segues between songs, the 
sound levels were perpetually 
uneven, making listening diffi
cult at times.
Musically, Sweeneys tracks 
were mostly of the techstep vari
ety: dark, sparse, and mechani
cal, with an occasional brighten
ing flourish. While this made for 
a slightly monotonous perfor
mance, it set the stage well for 
the next five performers.
Next was Dingo, sophomore art 
major Rodger Ruzanka. Much of 
this set was in the trip-hop cat
egory, with slow relaxing beats 
and subtle progressions. Though 
there were two live performers  
Rodger on bass and senior com
puter science major An
gela Saval providing vo
cals  poor sound mix
ing made the live ele
ment a hindrance.
The bass was too domi
nant in the mix and de
stroyed the tranquility 
of the music, and Savals 
voice was quite low and 
hollow. However, the 
tracks Rodger created 
were all generally de
cent, however sabotaged 
by the sound.
After Dingo was Spike 
Katara, better known as E-Tek. 
His rather short set included fairly 
unobtrusive and well-mixed 
trance music. Katara used a drum 
set along with the synthesized 
rhythm track, complementing and 
accenting the songs instead of let
ting the live element overpower. 
The performance was fairly welldone, despite its brevity.

tiresome after a while, in part be

Life Is Beautiful
Life Is Beautiful, starring Roberto Benigni, (who 
also wrote and directed the film) has probably been 
one of the most talked-about movies of the year. 
Recently having won several Oscars, including 
best actor (Benigni), best musical score, and best 
foreign language film, Life Is Beautiful takes a 
comic but profound stab at the horrors of the 
Holocaust. Benigni plays an Italian Jew who is 
taken away to a concentration camp during World 
War II. Benignis character, Guido, devises a 
scheme to convince his young son (Giorgio 
Cantarini) that the entire situation is just a big 
game  designed so that the winner will get a 
tank. Lauded as one of the most profound movies 
on the Holocaust in the history of film, this humor
ous and therefore controversial film takes a dive 
into the inner heart of mankind.

The Thin Red Line
Soldiers in war bonding to form a common broth
erhood  have we heard this story before? It is the 
underlying plot seen in practically every war movie 
this year (except with better actors and more, 
much more, emotion). The cinematography also 
puts The Thin Red Line into a class of its own. Set 
during the crucial battle of Guadalcanal in World 
War II, soldiers find themselves fighting for issues 
above the average sel&family/country mix. Form
ing a unique family-like status these soldiers live 
and die (bloody, bloody, bloody) for each other. 
Appearances by popular actors like Sean Penn, 
John Cusack, Nick Nolte, Woody Harrelson, and 
George Clooney remind us that Hollywoods ulti
mate goal is to draw in a huge female audience. 
This time, not so many teenage girls.

Patch Adams
One of those classic movies in which the good guy 
must rise above the constraints of society, Patch 
Adams is a story of Hunter Patch Adams, a medical 
school student in the early 70s who treats his 
: patients with the love and humor that is missing 
from present-day medical practice. The hospital 
1 administrators dont like Patchs crazy antics, and 
do everything in their power to prevent Patch, who 
_ gets the highest marks in the class, from becoming 
a doctor. Based on a real story, and a novel by the 
Hi real-life Patch Adams called Gesundheit, Patch 
Adams is a heart-warming tale of how spirit and 
enthusiasm can conquer anything.

A night filled with gore and terror, these three

from stories developed in other horror movies, the 
three films follow the story of a good guy who is 
thrown into a horrible, bloody, hell-like situation, 
from which he must escape. Bon Appetit!

Local Greensburg, Penn., rock
ers The Juliana Theory came out 
with their anticipated debut fulllength album on March 23. The 
albums strengths derive from its 
driving melodies, explosive cho
ruses, and passionate vocals from 
singer Brett Detar. Its a fresh 
mark in the emo-pop scene, with 
the bands bursts of energy, sense 
of stirring, heartfelt music, and 
impassioned blend of melody, 
rock, and dynamic pop.
Brett Detars voice propels and 
energizes this recording into an 
explosion of emotions. The 
albums exquisite lyrics reflect 
childhood nostalgia, lost love, and 
romance. Even though the topics 
are mostly melancholy, the bands 
sound gives the topics a positive 
and personal quality.
The group has managed to grab 
an underground following across 
the nation without having much 
released except for a song on a 
fanzine sampler and a split CD
release with their hometown 
buddies, Dawson High. Not 
enough praise can be written for 
this band. The Juliana Theory 
has a unique sound that is sooth
ing, refreshing, and smooth, yet 
edgy. If you dont like them for 
the music, then you will like them

Autechre vein. While Johnny Fingers set was 
quite attention-getting, this was a more un
derstated performance. Mostly the quirky 
music served as a backdrop for conversing 
partygoers, but was nevertheless well-composed and attention-rewarding.
The concert ended with Parsec, senior ECE 
student Chris Weller. Perhaps the best per
formance of the evening, his tracks were not 
only produced quite well but were also devel
oped well. The songs managed to sound pro
fessional without sounding manufactured, and 
current without being trendy. In one of the 
few occasions of the evening, a few people in 
the seemingly disaffected audience began to 
dance to the trance and techno.
That was perhaps the most amazing act of 
the evening. In all, the concert was a surpris
ing look at the local techno talent of Carnegie 
Mellon, and perhaps even an inspiration for 
budding musicians to go out and create their 
own music.
for you on this record. This is a 
total winner.
Only two words can describe 
The Juliana Theory in a nutshell: 
beautiful and rocking.

The Matrix: Music from the Mo
tion Picture 
Maverick
Not having seen The Matrix, 
its difficult for me to evaluate its 
soundtrack as far as its worth as 
a companion piece to the film. 
And so, I have been left to assess 
it based on its musical merits. 
The albums whos-who roster of 
hard rock and techno artists like 
Rage Against the Machine and 
Prodigy made it look promising 
at first glance, and there are cer
tainly some keepers on the disc. 
However, the lack of new songs 
from the marquee artists, as well 
as some decidedly boring 
electrnica, weigh the album 
down considerably.
The album begins with a blast, 
namely the one-two punch of 
Marilyn Mansons menacing 
Rock is Dead and 
Propellerheads clever
Spybreak. Aside from grabbing 
the listeners attention, these 
tracks establish a creepy, dark 
atmosphere that should have been 
sustained for the rest of the disc.
Contributions from Meat 
B eat Manifesto and Ministry are 
not especially exciting and dont 
add much to the emotional feel 
of the disc.
The most disappointing aspect 
of this album is the selection of 
songs from the big-name stars on 
the soundtrack. Rammsteins Du 
Hast pops up yet again, while 
Prodigy, Rage Against the Ma
chine, and Monster Magnet toss in 
tracks from previous albums which 
simply seem out of place on The 
Matrix. This is not to say that the 
songs themselves on the album are
not quality. Deftones My Own 
Summer (Shove It) is a great song, 
and there are more than a few 
others worth salvaging. Unfortu
nately, the lack of any thematic 
connection between the songs and 
the absence of new music makes 
this release just okay.
 ANDY FRANCIS
Underworld
Beaucoup Fish 
JBO limited
Underworld hit it big in 1996 
due to the success of 
Trainspotting; their song Born 
Slippy was featured promi
nently in the films climax. They 
then took a few years off from 
their musical pursuits to work 
for Tomato, one of Englands top 
design firms.
On Beaucoup Fish, they re-establish themselves as one of the 
premier techno acts of the 90s. 
The album opens with an incred
ible analog bass line on Cups. 
You think youve got the song 
figured out, but then the percus
sion begins a half beat off the 
perceived bass lines beat. Its an 
interesting effect that keeps you 
off-balance. After mutating 
through eight minutes of Karl 
Hydes stream-of-consciousness 
vocals and downbeat jazz-like 
keyboards, the song takes a dra
matic shift. The percussion speeds 
up as a background synth line 
takes center stage, and all other 
elements of the beginning of the 
song are now gone. The synth 
line fights for prominence back 
and forth with a new element of a 
human voice sample, barely rec
ognizable as such.
The songs on Beaucoup Fish 
arent all meant for such intense 
and rewarding listening. Others 
like King of Snake and Kit
tens were written with one thing 
in mind: dancing. The former 
seems to be a summary of all 
electronic dance music up to now.
An analog bassline, a steady 4/4 
beat, and a piano riff drive this 
song as Hydes voice echoes in 
and out.
Beaucoup Fish will not convert 
people over to electronic music; it 
sounds more like music for 2009 
than 1999. But if you like techno, 
definitely pick this one up.

Honky Toast
Whatcha gonna do honky ?
Uncle Andy Johns
Dont be confused by the flam
ing trailers, monster trucks, and 
song titles like Alcoholic Mama 
and I Wanna be on Welfare. 
Honky Toast comes from New 
Jersey, and the base of their sound 
rests solidly on the hard rock of 
the past decade or two.
The bands first CD, Whatcha 
gonna do honky"?, isnt simply an 
exercise in genre, however. 
Honky Toast manages to come 
up with enough psycho-billy riffs 
to bring it down to the trailer 
park, and mixes in some lighter 
ska-and surf-inspired songs to 
break up the harder stuff.
But ultimately the band works 
best with driving rock and bal
lads, such as Hair in my Teeth 
Again and Rocks Off.
While not all of its tracks are 
groundbreaking, Honky Toast, 
with its excellent instrumental 
base and creativity, promises to 
develop into a successful, origi
nal group.

DANCE, from page L10
ror, came a more R&B-based number by 
Tyrese called Sweet Lady. Performed by 
Kodwo Dadzie, Oyewole Oyenuga, Tyler 
Lewis, Debica Bhattacharya, Jaya Saxena, 
Melanie Stawartz, Zuley Clarke, and 
ArijitDey, Sweet Lady came across more 
as a smooth music video type of piece 
than the other more intricately choreo
graphed numbers.
While many of the pieces appeared to 
have been executed effortlessly, much 
time and practice went into putting to
gether such seamless dances. Monica 
Ullagaddi, a first-year electrical and com
puter engineering major, choreographed 
two pieces for the show, one of which 
involved 10 dancers.
The choreography took about two 
days, but we rehearsed for about two to 
three hours a day for four weeks, said 
Ullagaddi.
The hard work certainly seemed to pay 
off. Despite the additional dancers on the 
stage creating a greater likelihood of an 
out-of -sync number, the dance moved 
quite fluidly combining both modern 
dance steps and traditional Indian dances 
and garments.
There was hardly a dull moment through
out the entire evening. Clothing changes 
occurred relatively quickly, and the MC 
joked around with the crowd as the dancers 
prepared backstage. The evening concluded 
with a dance by Andress Appolon, Damali 
Bobb, Zuley Clarke, and Haj ChenziraPinnock, which was most certainly a show 
stopper. Wearing multi-colored wigs and 
dancing to an assortment of rap and R&B 
songs, these four exhibited unique choreog
raphy as well as tight gymnastics moves. 
The dance appeared to have been rehearsed 
for months, yet it was produced in a rela
tively short time.
Damali [Bobb] choreographed the dances, 
which took about three days, and we had 
about five three-hour rehearsals before the 
show, said Chenzira-Pinnock, a first-year 
drama major.
The effort put in by all was definitely 
apparent on stage. All of the dancers seemed 
well- rehearsed and energetic, and with the 
exception of some sound trouble with one of 
Ullagaddis dances, the music was on par 
with the intensity of the evening. It would 
appear that this semesters program was 
aptly named, for it most certainly was an 
explosion of talent.

Tartan Day is to honor the major role Scottish Americans played in founding this country. On March 20, 1998,the U.S. Senate passed a 
resolution naming April 6 as Tartan Day. You ask why April 6 though? Well, the Scottish Declaration of Independence was signed on April 6, 
1320, and the American Declaration of Independence was modeled on that document Here are some facts, to show you the role of Scot?
in America: I) 35 U.S. Supreme Court Justices have been 
Scots. 2) Of 73 great Americans in the Hall of Fame, 25 
were of Scottish blood. 3) Nearly half of the Secretaries of 
the U.S. Treasury and one third of the Secretaries of State 
have been of Scotish origin. 4) Of the 56 signers of the 
Declaration of Independence, nine were directly or indirect
ly descended from Scots. 5J nine out of 13 Governors of 
the newly created United States were Scots or of Scottish 
descent 6) Of 50 judges of the Supreme Court from 
1759-1882, at least 15 were of Scottish ancestry. 7) 
James Pollock (1810-90), responsible for putting "In 
God We Trust on the U.S. coinage, was of Scottish 
descent We at The Tartan Calendar want to take this opportu
nity to honor our Universitys Scottish heritage and wish everyone a 
happy Tartan Day.
