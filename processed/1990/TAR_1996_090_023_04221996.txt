Wall St. Journal looks 
at CMUs financial aid
By GIL ALTEROVITZ
Tartan Senior Staffwriter
The Wall Street Journal recently pub
lished an article about several different 
colleges approaches to financial aid  
using statistical models. Entitled Ex
pensive Lesson: Colleges Manipulate Fi
nancial Aid Offers, Shortchanging 
Many, published April 1, the article 
focuses on Carnegie Mellon and several 
other universities.
 Last year, Steve Stecklow, the author 
ofthe article, gained publicity after writ
ing about universities that misrepre
sented statistics and data about them
selves to U.S. News and World Report, 
allegedly hoping to be ranked higher in 
the magazines annual ranking of the 
American universities.
Stecklow described the point of The 
Wall Street Journal piece. I think what 
the story pointed out is that a lot of 
schools are awarding financial aid based 
on factors quite different from what a 
Students actual need is, and they are 
not telling this to parents and students. 
This is like a big secret. Again, the aid 
can be based on such factors as what 
major a student shows an interest in, 
said Stecklow.
There has been some controversy over 
how to interpret the article, so a special 
effort has been taken to bring out the 
f the central ideas expressed 
regarding The Wall Street Journal ar
ticle.
 At one of the other schools mentioned, 
Johns Hopkins, a controversy has
sprung up about how serious the alle
gations by The Wall Street Journal ac
tually are. The University has some 
questions it needs to answer, but at this 
time, its hard to tell how serious the 
problems are that Stecklow might have 
alleged in his article. But we, the news
paper, and I, personally, are not dis
missing the possibility that there [were 
things that went on] that probably 
shouldnt [have], said Maximilian 
Barteau, Editor-in-Chief of The John 
Hopkins News-letter. At that school, 
an enhanced financial aid package was 
given to those students who put down a 
humanities major on their applications, 
in order to encourage more of these 
students to attend Hopkins, according 
to a Hopkins administrator in auarticle 
in The John Hopkins News-letter.
Some of the non-need based factors 
which the article alleges some colleges 
are using include applying early admis
sion, as well as a students home state 
and interest shown in the school. The 
ultimate extension of this would be the 
non-need blind admission, according to 
the article.
Unlike the Johns Hopkins University 
model discussed in the article, Carnegie 
Mellon does not use interest expressed 
in the school when calculating financial 
aid in its model. According to Jeff Bolton, 
vice president for planning and budget, 
We do not do that. Thats an absolute. 
He said that CMU also does not use the 
home state of the student or whether or 
not the student applied early admission.

Director steps down
By TREVOR MEYEROWITZ
Tartan Staffwriter
Despite his attachment to his 
co-workers and his devotion to 
CMU, Director of Residence Life 
Tim Foster has decided to leave 
Carnegie Mellon.
Foster will be leaving Carnegie 
Mellon in mid-June and will be
come Dean of First-Year students 
at Bowdoin College in Brunswick, 
Maine on July 1.
Carnegie Mellon has afforded 
me so many opportunities. This 
has been a very exciting place to 
work the past five years. It was 
a very difficult decision to leave 
CMU, but this opportunity is a 
very compelling one both pro
fessionally and personally.... I 
will miss this a great deal, said 
Foster.
His new jobs responsibilities 
include heading the Bowdoins 
first-year orientation program
and directing all pre-major ad
vising at the college.
Foster said that he is also resigningbecause he wants to raise 
his daughter in New England. 
Personally, my wife and I have 
strong ties to the New England 
area. Her family is from the Bos
ton area, and we both attended 
college at Dartmouth in New 
Hampshire and worked for the 
Admissions Office after our 
graduations. We now have a ninemonth-old daughter, Dakota, and 
the opportunity to have her grow 
up in New England is something 
[that is] important to us, said 
Foster.
Dean of Student Affairs 
Michael Murphy is conducting 
the search for a person to fill 
Fosters position. It remains to be 
seen if a replacement with 
Fosters character and vision will 
be found.

CIT dean announces resignation
By JENNY GARCIA de OSUNA
Assistant Forum Editor
I have a great love of this University. However, 
the opportunities Michigan offers me in personal 
growth and the expansion of duties I will receive are 
things I should take advantage of, said Stephen 
Director, dean of Carnegie 
Institute of Technology 
(CIT) upon his resignation.
Starting in the fall, Director 
will become Dean of Engi
neering at the University of 
Michigan.
Since Director became 
Dean of CIT, the college has 
seen strong curriculum reforitf. There have been significant changes in the 
undergraduate program, such as introductory en
gineering courses available freshman year. There 
has also been an increase in the flexibility of the 
programs, allowing students to have a broader 
undergraduate experience and allowing students 
to use engineering as a base for non-engineering 
careers, such as law or medicine.
However, the most dramatic curriculum change
was in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE). 
Anew degree, the bachelor of science in electrical and 
computer engineering (BSECE), was implemented.
The changes that have been put forth into the 
undergraduate program have allowed it to be ranked 
at the top in U.S. News & World Report, said 
Director. That to me is phenomenal considering the 
small size ofthe college. 
There has also been a 
steady increase in rec
ognition in the gradu
ate program, continued 
Director. It is not that 
we focus on recognition, 
but it is phenomenal to 
see the department 
climb from the top 20 to 
become ranked sixth in the nation.
However, Directors accomplishments did not 
begin with his role as dean. Back in 1982, the 
semiconductor industry decided to fund university 
research in computer-aided design. Director, along 
with his colleagues, submitted a proposal to the 
industry which presented the department a sus
taining grant to establish a Center of Excellence.

More people than were expected turned out to commemorate those 
who died in the Holocaust.
By SHANNON GIBNEY
Tartan Contributing Editor
The CMU community proved 
that the memories of Holocaust 
victims live on by coming to
gether last Tuesday in com
memoration. Students, faculty, 
staff, and members of the 
greater Pittsburgh community 
gathered together to remember 
the six million Jews, as well as 
gypsies and homo
sexuals killed at 
Nazi concentration 
camps.
Yom Hashoah, or 
Holocaust Day, is ob
served internation
ally. At CMU, a va
riety of events took 
place in honor of the 
day including a 24- 
hour reading of the 
names of victims, an art instal
lation on the Cut, and a com
munity-wide Holocaust com
memoration through music, art, 
speeches, and theater at Sol
diers and Sailors Memorial 
Hall. CMU Holocaust Day organizers and participants alike 
deemed the events immensely 
successful, and hope to continue 
the remembrance in the future.
People seemed to respect the 
commemoration, to honor the 
people, to appreciate reading 
names, to examine the art in
stallation pieces and read the 
quotes on the backs. Awareness 
was raised.... Hundreds of 
people stopped by to listen to

grateful to see young people

the names and look at the faces 
at some point during the day. I 
am so impressed with the CMU 
campus and the hearts of the 
people that are part of the com
munity, said Daniella Topol, a 
senior directing major and an
organizer of the reading.
The response was over
whelming. In addition to the 
original 144 people who were 
scheduled for 10 minute inter
vals, there were probably 
around 70 others who read, 
said Michael Robertson, a mas
ters student in public policy 
and management, who worked 
with Topol in planning the read
ing.
Many of those who read the 
names of victims were deeply 
moved by the action. Charisse 
Davis, a sophomore chemistry 
major said, Reading the names 
made me feel good for recogniz
ing those that suffered the 
losses of family and friends 
during the Holocaust. At the 
same time, my thoughts were 
very depressing as I was read
ing. It was a huge book full of 
people who had lives, hopes, 
and families that were taken 
away from them.
Topol said, Many people 
were moved by the act of read
ing names and commented on 
how different it was to read (as 
opposed to listen). Many people 
were related to victims or had 
[family friends] 
who were victims. 
Like the reading 
of names, the dra
matic presentation 
at Soldiers and 
Sailors Memorial 
Hall also affected 
the audience and 
the performers. 
Leigh Silverman, a 
senior drama ma
jor who wrote and directed the

At least 75 lay dead after 
Israeli bombing of Lebanon
QANA, Lebanon April 18, (AP)  It 
was supposed to be a safe place. The 
-Lebanese refugees were resting in a 
grass hut after lunch, watching their 
children play and hoping the compound 
of Fijian U.N. peacekeepers would pro
tect them from Israeli attack.
Minutes later, the hut was gone, the 
base awash in blood and smoke and 
strewn with the bodies of at least 75 
dead. Some peacekeepers were too 
stunned to act. Others, in their flak 
jackets and blue helmets, placed blan
kets over mangled victims. One peace
keeper held in his arms a headless 
child.
The first Israeli shell hit at 3 p.m. 
Thursday, screeching over the hills 
and slamming into this makeshift en
campment. Four others followed in 
the bloodiest attack yet in Israels 
eight-day campaign against Hezbollah 
guerrillas in south 
Lebanon. More than 
100 people, including 
four Fijians, were 
wounded in what . Is
rael said was 
misaimed fire in
tended for Hezbollah 
guerrilla positions.
I ... found myself 
amidst blood and torn limbs, said 20- 
year-old Hussein Balhas, covered in 
bandages for shrapnel wounds, in his 
hospital bed. I staggered to my feet 
and tried to help the U.N. soldiers, but
I saw my sister was dead, a big hole in 
her chest.
A Lebanese soldier, Balhas had been 
visiting his family, who were among 
400,000 refugees who fled their vil
lages when Israel warned it would 
attack south Lebanon. Most went 
north, but 6,000 stayed in the south at 
U.N. bases they thought would be safe. 
About 500 refugees were at the base 
with the 70-member Fijian force in 
Qana.
While expressing regret for the ci
vilian deaths, Israel fiercely defended 
the rocket-and-artillery barrages it has 
unleashed against suspected 
Hezbollah targets.
President Clinton called for a cease
fire by all parties to the fighting and 
ordered Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher to the region to mediate.
Lebanese leaders called the Israeli 
shelling the mother of all atrocities 
and a new page in the annals of ter
ror.
Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres 
said, Im pained by every person, ev
ery woman, every child, who is being 
killed. But he said Israel had no 
choice but to defend its citizens, and 
he accused the Iranian-backed guer
rillas of Hezbollah of hiding behind
civilians.
Israels Army radio reported later 
Thursday that Israel had agreed to a 
cease-fire as called by the United States 
on the condition that Syria and Leba
non commit to restraining the 
Hezbollah.
News of the shelling was first radi
oed from the base. Were under fire. 
Shells are landing on headquarters. 
People are dying here, said a U.N. 
operator, his voice choking.
Wailing women beat their chests. 
Men slapped their palms to their fore
heads in disbelief, and some shouted, 
Death to Israel! They also blamed 
Israels main ally, adding, Death to 
America!
The United Nations said that shortly 
before the Israeli shells landed, 
Hezbollah guerrillas about 300 yards 
from the U.N. compound had fired two

Katyusha rockets and eight mortar 
rounds at the Israelis. Hezbollah de
nied firing rockets, but Israel said its 
shells were in retaliation for the rocket 
fire, and that hitting the refugees was 
a mistake.
U.N. spokesman Timur Goksel said 
there were at least 75 dead, but an 
exact death toll was difficult to deter
mine because casualties were spread 
around several hospitals and many of 
those killed in Qana had been blown 
apart.
The shelling followed a meeting be
tween Peres and Palestinian leader 
Yasser Arafat, who announced they 
would resume their peacemaking and 
begin talks on a final settlement.
The guerrillas have been fighting 
since 1985 to drive Israeli troops from 
the border enclave they occupy in south 
Lebanon. Syria, the main power bro
ker in Lebanon, has stayed out of the 
latest conflict.
Israel began its air and artillery 
blitz eight days ago to silence Hezbollah 
rocket fire on northern Israel. It comes 
in the runup to Israeli elections at the 
end of May.
Before the attack on Qana, the re
cent fighting had killed 59 people and 
wounded 199, most of them Lebanese 
civilians, according to Lebanese and 
Israeli authorities. That toll included
11 people killed earlier Thursday in 
the village of Nabatiyeh Fawqah, 20 
miles from the devastated U.N. base.
Ceremony honors bombing victims
OKLAHOMA CITY April 19, (AP)  
Where there had been sirens, screams, 
and smoke, on Friday there was silence 
broken only by the chirping of birds and 
the faint cries of a baby.
At a ceremony marking the first anni
versary of the Oklahoma City bombing, 
hundreds of mourners paused at 9:02 
am for 168 seconds of silence at the 
grassy site where the federal building 
once stoodone second for each person 
killed when a bomb exploded exactly one 
year earlier.
Motorists on highways nearby pulled 
over, their headlights on in remem
brance. A flyover of four F-16 jets and 
the tolling of a bell in a bomb-damaged 
church signaled the end of the silence.
Then the names of the 168 people who 
died were read slowly in alphabetical 
order, the speakersvoices at times crack
ing with emotion. During the litany, 
family members, some sobbing and em
bracing, laid wreaths, flowers, and teddy 
bears on the site ofthe demolished Alfred 
P. Murrah Federal Building.
Ted Allen.... Allen, an administrator 
at the Department of Housing and Ur
ban Development office, left a widow 
and six children.
Baylee Almon.... Baylees bloody, 
limp body was photographed in the arms 
of a firefighter moments after the blast. 
The photo became a symbol of the 19 
children killed in the blast.
Rebecca Anderson.... A nurse, Ander
son was killed by falling rubble when 
she rushed to the scene to rescue people.
Peachlyn Bradley.... Peachlyns 
mother, Daina Bradley Bruce, gave birth 
. Thursday to another child.
Mickey Maroney.... Maroney, a Se
cret Service agent, played on the Uni
versity of Arkansas championship foot
ball team in 1964.
Christi Rosas....- Mrs. Rosas was one 
of the last three victims recovered from 
the rubble, more than a month after the 
bombing.
Chase Smith.... Colton Smith....The 
death of the Smith boys prompted their 
grandfather Glen Wilburn to mount his 
own investigation of the bombing.
After the names were read, the fami
lies walked five blocks to the Myriad 
Convention Center for a memorial ser
vice open to the rest of the public.
Brian Fields, a paramedic who re
sponded one year ago, said he watched 
the procession with a mixture of pain, 
fear, numbness, and relief.
It looked like it hailed glass and rained 
blood, he said, recalling the scene a 
year ago. The smoke was so thick you 
couldnt see across the street.
Arlene Blanchard, a former Army ser
geant, was in the Army Recruiting Of
fice on the buildings fourth floor when 
the bomb exploded.
I had to come here today. I had to face 
it, she said. What I would take home
today is peace of mind. It kind of set my 
soul to rest. It was just like anvils being 
, taken off my shoulders.
Moments of silence were marked 
around the country. In the nations capi
tal, a somber tolling of bells interrupted 
the silence on a plaza outside the Trans
portation Department, and a lone trum
peter played taps. The Senate and the 
House also stopped briefly.
At the bombing site, mourners 
streamed to the service, many in tears, 
most wearing haunted expressions as 
they looked around at the shattered 
buildings that still stand near the bomb
ing site.
Volunteers and members of the U.S. 
Attorneys victim assistance unit passed 
out teddy bears. One little girl, wrapped 
in the jacket of her fathers suit against 
the morning wind, clutched the bear to 
her chest and stared wide-eyed at the 
buildings and the crowd.
A few moments before 9:02 am., an 
honor guard raised a flag on the parking 
garage, the only part of the building left 
standing. The flag was then lowered to 
half-staff to match the other flags snap
ping in the spring breeze. Bagpipers 
played Amazing Grace.
A year has passed since the trau
matic shattering of so many lives, the 
Rev. Don Alexander of the First Chris
tian Church told the mourners as the 
service opened. It has been a long year. 
A difficult year. We saw the face of evil, 
but we have also seen the face of love and 
compassion.
Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, 
the two men charged in the bombing, 
spent the day in their cells at a federal 
prison in Englewood, Colo. They are 
awaiting trial in Denver sometime late 
this year or early next year.Kevorkian walks out of courtroom
PONTIAC, Mich. April 19, (AP,)The 
two women who committed suicide in 
1991 in front of Dr. Jack Kevorkian 
werent terminally ill, a medical exam
iner testified today, but Kevorkian wasnt 
in court to hear the conflicting opinion.
Oakland County Medical Examiner 
L.J. Dragovic said 43-year-old Sherry 
Miller, who had multiple sclerosis, was 
not in life-threatening health despite 
the disease. She could have lived years, 
if not decades, he testified.
The other woman, Maijorie Wantz, 
58, suffered from psychogenic pain, he 
said.
Dragovic said the pain was perceived 
by her brain but there was no physical 
basis for it. She could have lived to 
beyond age 70, he said.
Dragovic took the stand today in a 
trial that went on without the defen
dant.
On Thursday, Kevorkian walked out 
of his third assisted suicide trial, saying 
a jail cell has more dignity than this 
lousy room.
Oakland County Circuit Judge David 
F. Breck allowed an angry and agitated 
Kevorkian to leave but said he could be 
required to return to testify.
Kevorkian asked to leave outside the 
jurys presence, and jurors did not see 
him leave. When they returned, they 
were told Kevorkian voluntarily excused 
himself and could return any time he 
wished.
Before he left, Kevorkian told his law
yers he would rather go to jail than sit 
through the rest of his trial.
I cant participate in this crap, thig 
corrupt system, he said during a break:
I want a rule that I dont have to be ig 
here, because Im about to explode.
Kevorkian is charged with two counts 
of common-law assisted suicide in the 
deaths. Miller, who had multiple sclero
sis, died after inhaling carbon nionox* 
ide; Wantz had severe pelvic pain and 
died of an injection of drugs.
If convicted, he faces up to 10 years ift 
prison. In two previous trials, he waij 
acquitted of violating a temporary state 
law aimed at stopping him.
Kevorkian said he is outraged that 
hes being tried in the latest cases undfef 
Michigan common law. That became' 
possible when the state Supreme Court 
ruled in 1994 that assisted suicide is a 
common-law crime.
Kevorkian originally had been charged 
with murder in both cases; Breck re
duced the charges after the high courts 
ruling.Teenagers send President threats;
DETROIT April 19, (AP)  Two 13-J 
year-old girls were ordered held without 
bond at a juvenile detention center after, 
being accused of sending letters threatf 
ening President Clinton and his family.
The girls mailed two letters before 
they were warned by Secret Service 
agents earlier this month, then 
three more, according to documents file;d 
in Wayne County Juvenile Court.
The sexually explicit letters were, 
signed with the name and address of. 
another student at Miller Middle School, 
where the two seventh-graders were, 
arrested Wednesday.
The suspects and the classmate were, 
feuding, the Detroit Free Press reported 
today.
This really appears to me to be 
childhood prank, but the reason its bering taken so seriously is because of thelanguage in that letter, said Scott Bergo,/ 
an attorney for one of the girls.
The girl denies writing the letter, he 
said. Bergo and the other girls attorney,;: 
Barbara Jo Safran, said the letters were^ 
written by one person and a handwrifo 
ing expert would have to decide who it;, 
was. :
A hearing was scheduled for next.i

50 YEARS AGO, April 30, 
1946: The Interfratemity Coun
cil-sponsored Greek Sing and 
Swing was held in Thistle Hall 
and the Gymnasium. Back then, 
the event also included a semiformal dance.
Sigma Alpha Epsijnn easily won 
the mens competition, which fea
tured tuxedo-clad Betas and 
Theta Xis singing side by side. 
The sorority competition was a 
close battle won by Kappa Kappa 
Gamma.
Although it was customary for 
audiences to behave poorly dur
ing the events, they remained 
reasonably attentive and gave the 
various organizations an equal 
chance to do their best. A dance 
in the gym followed the singing 
competition.
25 YEARS AGO, April 22, 
1971: Crime and security were 
key issues on campus. The num
ber of reported incidents of theft 
for the months of September 
through March increased 10 per
cent over the previous year. The 
Presidents Security Policy Advi
sory Board recommended to move 
the Security Office into Skibo, 
switch Security to new, less tra
ditional uniforms, and take a com
plete inventory ofthe entire cam
pus sometime in the near future. 
The campus Security Director 
warned of the security problems 
that come with Spring Carnival.
Among his recommendations 
were to beware of nails and mate
rial lying on the ground when 
walking barefooted through Mid
way, keep out of the way of the 
buggy races, and to not let chil
dren play near the booths.
10 YEARS AGO ,April22,1986: 
Three Alpha Tau Omega brothers 
were burned when a fire erupted 
in their rented truck during the 
preliminary buggy races.
The fire started while brothers 
were treating the buggys wheels 
with hexane. The hexane leaked 
onto a radio, which burst into 
flames. The injuries occurred as 
fraternity brothers pulled the 
buggy out of the truck so they 
could free the driver, who was not 
injured. While two of the injuries 
were small burns, one brother 
was burned on over 10 percent of 
his body.
Fire extinguishers from Theta 
Xi and PiKA were used to put out 
the fire before flames could reach 
the trucks gas tank.
FIVE YEARS AGO, April 22, 
1991: A former CMU employee
filed a lawsuit alleging sexual 
misconduct by former President,. 
Richard M. Cyert, then 55, by a, 
22-year-old CMU employee-^ 
Patricia Tanner said that she was, 
fired because of sex and age dis-, 
crimination.
Ms. Tanners complaint, 
stemmed back to a meeting with, 
President Cyert (19 years previ-. 
ously). Tanner said in order tor 
resist the sexual advances, she 
had to physically restrain Cyert.
CMU denied all assertions that 
Cyert ever acted inappropriately 
or tried to get Tanner fired.

Stephen Directors resignation is defi

became head of the department in 1982, 
and nine years later he became dean.
I have been at Carnegie Mellon for 
almost 19 years now and have found 
that there is a unique relationship among
the colleges. This University is a very 
inter-disciplinary place; the deans are 
very supportive of each other and work 
as a real team, Director said. It is 
wonderful to be dean of such outstand
ing students, faculty, and alumni.
As faculty member and Dean, Steve 
has been a leading contributor to the 
increasing stature and reputation of the 
college of engineering, said President 
Mehrabian and Provost Paul Christiano 
in a memo to the University.
The Dean of CIT for the next term has 
not yet been chosen. The department 
will appoint a small committee made up 
of engineering staff to decide what crite
ria they will be looking for in the next 
dean. They have not decided whether or 
not to limit the search to within the 
University or search nationally for the 
most qualified person.

. Zabell spoke about how Foster has reju
venated and expanded the Residence Life
office in many ways. One improvement 
that Foster made was his reform of the 
resident assistant (RA) program so that 
bad RAs wouldnt automatically have their 
position renewed for the next year.
He tried to bring new blood into the 
office. Under Tim, the office has evolved 
into something better, said Zabell. And 
more than just wishing him the best of 
luck in the future, I think that hes 
leaving here in the confidence that he 
has done a good job here, and in knowing 
that, I think that wherever he goes, he 
will do well and change the character of 
whatever environment hes in.
CMU commemorates 
victims of Holocaust
HOLOCAUST, from page 1
tresses and I were surrounded by 
people holding our hands and hug
ging us as soon as the event was over. 
I think everyone felt very grateful to 
see young people promising to re
member, promising not to forget their 
pain.
Dagmara Domincyzk, a sophomore 
acting major who performed in 
Silvermans piece, added, The most 
meaningful part of the performance 
was just being there amidst and in 
front of these people who had gone 
through unspeakable atrocities and 
horrors, and us trying to capture a 
small part of their grief and pain 
through our craft.... That night, look
ing out at their thankful faces before 
me, I was once again reminded of the 
magic and power of theater when 
that theater has purpose and pu
rity.
Robertson, Topol, and Silverman all 
expressed the desire to continue Holo
caust Day events at CMU next year. 
They hope that others will pick up 
where they left off, and make the day 
even better.
We [Robertson and Topol] plan to 
put together a manual that helps or
ganize the event for next year. With 
this plan we hope to evaluate this 
year.... The [name reading] is only 
two years old, and we hope that it will

grow each year and that more of the 
outside community [will be] aware of 
it. The event was actually covered by 
several newspapers and at least two 
radio stations; hopefully, each year 
media coverage will grow, said 
Robertson.
Topol said, [In the future we would 
like] to invite more survivors to read 
names and perhaps to share personal 
stories  to find more of the nonJews killed in the Holocaust and per
haps even to find names of those 
killed in Bosnia and other countries 
from this type of genocide. The 
broader we can make this event, with
out losing the specific Jewish memo
rial day, the more effective the com
memoration will be.

he will still try to have a positive impact 
on the campus community. Iftheres an

In response to the perennial low turn
out, Krug said, As student government 
does more for students, voter turnout 
will improve.
On Vice President Katie Hart, Krug 
said, Her people skills are very strong. 
Shes someone who goes out and seeks 
student opinion. The two of us will be 
able to effectively represent more stu
dents.
Szudarek added that he would advise 
Krug to keep an open mind throughout 
his term. Dont become a part of the 
system. He has good ideas and I hope 
hes able to follow through with all of 
them.
Presidential powers include forming 
committees to discuss policy making. 
These committees dont have any real 
power, but Szudarek said, I think that 
if Bryon forms committees that students 
are concerned about, such as the Activi
ties Fee [they would have more influ
ence] . He needs to form committees with 
good chairs.
Vice President Katie Hart and ex
candidate Michael Rosenthal could not 
be reached for comment.
The Wall Street Journal scrutinizes CMUs financial aid policy
FINANCIAL AID, from page 1
Bolton said that CMU uses 
need-blind admission. We are 
admitting students based on aca
demic, artistic qualities, and tal
ents, he said.
Depending on the CMU school 
to which a student applies, the 
financial aid package can vary on 
the merit side from $1,000 to 
,000 per year, according to 
Linda Anderson, director of fi-^icial aid. Bolton rioted that 
there is a need-based component 
of financial aid that I would say is 
probably consistent across the 
University [colleges].
The article refers to Carnegie 
Mellon as a pioneer in statistical 
modeling. It observed that ad
ministrators meet several hours 
each week to tinker with formulas 
and review the latest spreadsheets 
that attempt to predict yield, the 
percentage of accepted students 
in'different groups that will actu
ally enroll if money is taken from 
one group and given to another.  
William Elliot, vice president 
ir enrollment, said one of the 
chief limitations when it comes to 
deciding how to give out financial 
aid is the cost of running the 
University. Could we enroll a 
better class if we had more 
money? I dont think there is 
aiiyone who would disagree with 
that, but there isnt [more 
money], he said. Therefore, 
basically we have to stay within 
the same parameters, the same 
amount of money.
Its a yield dollar output combi
nation that the model analyzes in 
calculating how to distribute the 
money, Bolton recalled. Given a 
hypothetical case in which two stu
dents of the same quality applied 
where the only variable was need, 
Bolton suggested the following 
might be recommended by the 
model, [With the] same quality, 
the percentage will vary, so a high 
quality student who has a need of 
a couple thousand dollars may have 
100 percent of their need met 
through grants... a very high need 
student, one needing $20,000 or 
more, of the same quality level, 
may have 80 percent met. 
Stecklow said, Im not sure 
that every student at Carnegie 
Mellon knows and that their par
ents know that if two students 
are judged equally, but have dif
ferent financial aid needs, that 
they may get very different of
fers. One student may get far 
more than they need and the oth
er may get far less in terms of 
grants. That creates a situation 
where poorer students can get 
saddled with big loans, and 
wealthier students have extra 
spending money.
Stecklow said that his num
bers were based on internal 
records, although he conceded 
that these were recommendations 
made by the model and were not 
necessarily enacted.
Factors that determine 
financial need
Gina Schuyler, student body 
president, reacted to the article 
by saying, If what the article is 
asserting [is true], which Im in
terpreting is that Carnegie 
Mellon is failing to meet the fi
nancial need of students in order 
to entice other students to at
tend, then I am outraged. But it 
is my understanding that at Car
negie Mellon, the financial aid 
office does meet the financial aid 
need equation for. each student 
and then adds on merit-basedscholarships to entice more de
sirable students to come.
Elliot detailed an objective that 
is taken into account when mak
ing these decisions: The
institutions primary objective is 
to enroll the number of students 
for which we have capacity of the 
highest quality and, within that, 
there are a variety of trade-offs. 
He later mentioned, One of the 
things were concerned about here 
is having the appropriate number 
of students in each of the ... col
leges. If a yield model were not 
used, Id have an institution full 
of engineers and computer scien
tists and I wouldnt have anybody 
in arts and design, Elliot said in 
The Wall Street Journal article.
This is an ugly, ugly 
business
The article claims that Walter 
Cathie, former associate vice
Resnik Challenger Scholarship 
alluded to by Stecklow was a very 
small part of all the total scholar
ship available to incoming stu
dents and there are Universitysponsored merit based scholar
ships available to male engineers.

"/ think the whole thing is quite sad if 
it comes down to high school stu
dents having to lie about what their 
areas of interest [are]...
 Steve Stecklow, writer of article
cial aid, he said. He shared one 
phone call from a high school stu
dent with a question on what major 
she should declare at each of the 
schools she was applyingto. Were 
not dealing specifically with Car
negie Mellon, but... she was think
ing of telling one school one thing, 
another school anotherthing, 
because she might get more 
financial aid that way, he 
said. I think the whole thing 
is quite sad if it comes down 
to high school students hav
ing to lie about what their 
areas of interest and ambi
tions are because colleges are 
awarding financial aid based 
on factors that are beyond 
their control.
president for financial resources, 
left a financial post at Carnegie 
Mellon last year partly because 
of ethical reasons. He was quoted 
in the article as saying, This is 
an ugly, ugly business. Elliot 
remarked, I think, quite frankly, 
it was taken out of context.
The author of The Wall Street 
Journal piece said he stands by 
his article on this matter. In 
support of the article, he pro
vided previously unpublished in
formation on what Walter Cathie 
had allegedly told him. He told 
me that he had problems with 
basically giving out aid not strictly 
based on what a students actual 
need was, but in some cases over
rewarding aid to some students 
and under-rewarding it to other 
equally qualified, but needier stu
dents... . I know another thing that 
concerned Walter Cathie, which 
wasnt in the story, was a prac
tice of giving large scholarships 
to women engineers and to no 
male engineers.
After accessing data from the 
financial aid department and in
formational brochures, though, 
it was discovered that the Judith
schedule an interview, Cathie, now 
at Wabash College in Indiana, 
could not be reached for comment.
I think the whole thing is 
quite sad...
In an interview, Stecklow said 
he received several phone calls 
from people concerning the ar
ticle. I got one or two calls from 
people about Carnegie Mellon, but 
people were generally incensed 
about the whole business of finan
Without quality students, 
what would a CMU degree 
be worth?
Quality was a factor in deter
mining how much aid a student 
gets, according to Bolton. With
out quality students, what would 
a CMU degree be worth in the 
future? asked Elliot. Given the 
constraint of limited financial 
resources, the school tries to opti
mize its aid so as to get highquality students. Youve got to 
get back to the drive. Youve got 
to have the quality to make these 
kinds of institutions what they 
are, said Elliot.
On a similar note, Schuyler said, 
Not only does Carnegie Mellon 
have the most interest in getting 
the highest quality candidates to 
come to this University, but all 
the other students here have a 
vested interest in [getting] the 
best students to be here. 
Ultimately, the financial aid 
recommendations made by the 
statistical model are not neces
sarily enacted, accordingto Bolton. 
At the end, it comes down to a 
limited amount of funds to help 
potential students and their fami
lies. Bolton commented, Its a gutwrenching decision to have, if you 
will, a tearful mother or father, or 
a student coming along and [say
ing], If it were for more money, I 
could come.... [But] I dont have 
enough money because Ive got to 
pay the bills.... Its not a lot of fun 
to hang that phone up....
In terms of making it an equi
table process, a consistent pro
cess, I believe weve taken great 
pains to do that, Bolton said.

FORUM
Carnegie Mellon University22 Aprii 1996
Leadership turnover 
causes problems
With last years college rankings 
showing continued success for 
Carnegie Mellon, one might ask as 
to where these nationally-recog
nized programs get their inspira
tion, their drive, and a lot of the 
time, their heart? So what happens 
if these leaders, who build and nur
ture programs worthy of such high 
accolades, decide that their duty at 
CMU is done, and get ready to step 
down? We are about to find out.
With some of CMUs highest rank
ing administration and directorial 
leaders announcing their resigna
tions recently, we are left to wonder 
what effects the campus commu
nity will feel. Just as CMU is gain
ing momentum in national rankings 
by maintaining and even increas
ing its standards in many areas, 
there is now a possibility that this 
progress may be halted or delayed 
because of an inconsistency in lead
ership resulting from the transfer 
of power. With so many important 
leaders stepping down from their 
positions, what is going to be done 
to ensure a smooth transition and a 
continuation of the high standards 
that CMU has always strived to 
bbtain?
 President Mehrabian has agreed 
to stay on until his successor has 
been found, but once he is gone, will 
the same level of commitment with 
which he has pursued projects be 
maintained? It is quite possible that 
with the transfer of power some of 
his current projects may be ne
glected if only because the new Presi
dent may have other ideas and opin
ions on what is important at the 
University.
; There are not only questions about 
fconsistency at the Presidential level. 
With the deans of individual col
leges resigning, as well as the direc
tor of the SEI and the director of 
Residence Life, it seems that vital 
components of the leadership struc
ture at the University are going to 
be filled with people new to the
positions, and possibly new to the 
University.
One way that a transfer of power 
at any level could be handled 
smoothly would be to promote in
ternally from the University. Natu
rally, a promotion from within would 
help provide continuity in the stan
dard of excellence already in place. 
Someone who has been at the Uni
versity and who is appreciative of 
how it works and aware of its 
strengths and weaknesses would 
be a logical choice to move up within 
the leadership structure because of 
their previous experience in deal
ing with many aspects of the Uni
versity.
With Tim Foster, director of Resi
dence Life leaving, we have to won
der about the long-term fate of RA 
program, which he reformed during 
his tenure.
The resignation of Stephen Direc
tor, dean of CIT and the earlier 
resignation of Dean Robert Sullivan 
from GSIA raise an interesting 
issue. Both undergraduate depart
ments of these schools were ranked 
third in the nation last year with 
respect to their curriculums, with 
respective graduate programs see
ing similar success.
If the strong leadership that 
brought these two schools to the 
forefront in their respective fields is 
suddenly replaced with leadership 
that may be just as good, but inex
perienced with the workings of the 
school, what will that mean for the 
continuity of quality in each school?
One thing is certain in these trans
fers of power in the larger adminis
tration no better time for student 
leadership and personal initiative 
could be presented.
With so many new deans, presi
dents and directors entering the 
CMU community, the student body 
would do well to find its strength 
from within, and rely on its student 
leadership, to see the community 
through the transitions.
History, traditions 
should be observed
Last Tuesday, students remem
bered the millions of deaths that 
Occurred during the Holocaust. 
While some may say that dwelling 
upon the negative aspects of history 
does little for a people, it is impor
tant to observe and recognize the 
importance of our heritages.
Tuesdays Yom Hashoah memo
rial, in which names of victims were 
read and broadcast across the Cut, 
was tastefully done and moving. 
Members of the community had an 
opportunity to actively honor the 
victims of the Holocaust in a direct 
and sincere manner. Passersby 
walked through the atmosphere cre
ated on the cut by the echoing voices 
from the fence, feeling the solem
nity of the memorial. The remem
brance for the victims of the Holo
caust was certainly effective.
Let us also consider the many 
other souls lost during war and geno
cide during other periods of history 
and in other areas around the world. 
Consider the massacres in East 
Timor in the last decade. Consider 
the purges of Stalin and the Com
munist Regime in China. Consider 
the slaughter of the Armenians by 
the Turks and ethnic cleansing tak
ing place right now in the Balkans. 
Consider finally the horrors in our 
shared history.
But these statements are not to 
cast a palor over remembrance. In
Letters to the Editor

the Editor
stead, these are examples of injus
tices that remain unnoticed and un
recognized on the scale of the Holo
caust, even though the loss, in hu
man terms was as great. We call 
upon the student body to attempt, 
in their own ways, to learn about 
and examine these historical events.
Groups like Amnesty Interna
tional, Mayur, ASA, KSA, religious 
groups, and the like should con
sider offering memorial and histori
cal education to their members and 
to the community. In so doing, we 
can hope to begin to build a small 
foundation upon which we may 
move away from the oppression 
which has characterized history in 
many situations. In addition, per
haps we may see the similarities 
between all nations histories and 
thereby learn to empathize with all 
those who suffer.
We are a student body made up of 
varied creeds, races, and histories. 
We laud those who organized and 
participated in the Yom Hashoah 
observation. In turn, however, we 
call on other groups in the Carnegie 
Mellon community to take example 
from the participants of the recent 
memorial. With pride and honor, 
we all must recall and observe those 
events in our traditions that are 
important, and share them with 
our community.
Tartan corrects 
platform mix-up
Editor: ^ R
Thank you for run
ning my picture on 
the front page of last 
weeks Tartan.
Hopefully everyone 
who saw it  recognized my face and 
voted for me during Carnival. With any 
luck, no one actually read my plat
form which ran under the picture. 
Anyone who read the platform prob
ably thought I was a fool and decided 
not to vote for me.
As you may have noticed, a portion of 
my platform was deleted. At first, I 
thought I had submitted an incomplete 
document. I checked my copy and con
firmed that I had given you a complete, 
well written, coherent platform. In case 
you have yet to find your error, allow 
me to point it out to you. It can be found 
on page three under the heading 
Szudarek. It reads, ... Instead of fix
ing the system, they have tried to work 
with arrive on campus half of an hour 
early for class or arrive just as class was 
beginning.... As you can see, this sen
tence is completely incoherent. If the 
missing 95 words are replaced, people 
will better understand my position.
I call upon the traditionally fair Edi
torial Board to apologize to me and to 
reprint my platform in its entirety. Al
though the votes are in and the election 
is over, I believe the campus commu
nity is entitled to read my platform in 
its original form.
Michael J. Szudarek
Sophomore
SDS
The following is Michael J. Szudareks 
corrected platform in its entirety:
. All of the people running for Student 
Body President are highly qualified. I 
can imagine what many of you are think
ing right now. You want to know which 
of these three candidates will best serve 
your needs. Who will lead us and also 
listen to us? I can meet the needs of the 
students.
The other candidates are current Sena
tors. They try to work hard and help the 
students. I argue that they cannot see 
the forest through the trees. Indeed, 
they each make contributions to the 
students, but they have become part of 
an imperfect system. Instead of fixing 
the system, they have tried to work with 
it. As we can all see, it has not worked. 
All of their good deeds are overshad
owed by lack of vision. I feel I can put my 
skills to work to correct the system.
I too have served on Senate. I have 
made just as much impact as the other 
candidates. As a member of the Campus 
Affairs Committee in 1993,1 corrected 
the mistakes with the CMU shuttle. At 
that,time, the buses arrived and de
parted at Skibo on the hour and the half. 
For example, 10:00 and 10:30. This forced 
students to either arrive on campus half 
of an hour early for class or arrive just as 
class was beginning. I worked out a plan 
with Sgt. Ricci and Chief LaPaglia to 
run the shuttle on the quarter and the 
three quarter hour. Now the shuttle 
arrives/departs at 9:45 and 10:15. The 
students are happy with the new, more 
logical schedule. The system was broken 
and I helped fix it.
I now want to adjust how the Activi
ties Fee money is allocated. Nearly all 
organizations agree that the current 
system is faulty. My solution is to allow 
each student to earmark part of their fee 
for a particular organization. The re
mainder of the money will remain in the 
general fund to be doled out by Senate. 
This system will allow the organizations 
which many students support to flour
ish. The smaller organizations and the 
largest campus wide organizations such 
as The Tartan, WRCT, and AB will not
be forgotten. All organizations which 
need more funds will present a budget to 
Senate as before. This system will be 
beneficial to all organizations.
The Student Body President cannot 
make these changes alone. I will appoint 
a committee to work out the ideas and 
present them to Senate. If our proposal 
is voted down by Senate, I will circulate 
a petition to the student body to force a 
change the current system. The system 
is broken and we will fix it.
Thank you for your interest in student 
government. Please remember to vote 
during Carnival.

Letter to 
the Editor
scrutinized
Editor: :aarThe editorial by Jon Ll
Orris (Conserva
tives seek end to abor
tion, April 15) was, 
for me, an excellent 
example of whats 
wrong with this abortion debate in the 
first place. Even though you are obvi
ously pro-choice, Mr. Orris, you let the 
anti-abortionists structure the terms of 
your debate.
Most people do; they spend hours 
arguing whether or not a fetus is a 
living being. As you were quick to point 
out, it is impossible to argue any fur
ther. So why did you spend the rest of 
your article doing just that?
Im sure you alientated all the conser
vative men and women on campus, but 
what else did you accomplish?
Articles like yours reinforce the belief 
that this is a theoretical debate. It is. 
not.
It is a reality which will continue no 
matter what you or anyone else thinks 
about it.
Instead of dealing with the changing 
family structures around us, the ab: 
sence of free birth control and related 
education, the reality of young men and 
women engaged in premaritial sex, you 
inform your readers that The fetus has 
no rights ... [because] it is dependent 
upon and part of its mothers body.
Why the moral context? Why the jus
tification?
Not everyone agrees with you, and  
guess what?
Not everybody has to. Unless, of 
course, you want to make abortion more 
than legal, and make it a requirement.
I want to keep the right to get a 
standard out-patient operation, if I am 
someday in a situation where I feel that 
its in my best interest.
I also want to make sure that other 
women keep the right to protect the 
precious life inside them.
We do not have to convince one an
other that life begins at birth, or that 
life begins in the fetus. Abortion is not a 
club decision.
When a woman is in the position 
where she might get an abortion, she is 
not thinking to herself, Hmm ... what 
should Amercia do? She is thinking, 
What should I do? Its a decision based 
on personal experiences, beliefs, and 
circumstances.
Frankly, Im tired of articles like yours 
which tell me nothing new, offer no 
fresh perspectives, and continue to let 
the debate turn on the moral wheel.
As a journalist, your job is to increase 
the level of intelligence in public de
bate, not increase the level of heat.
Im very glad to know you are prochoice.
Now maybe you should take a look at 
your war cries, and figure out how like 
the anti-abortionist you are.
Hey!
Im not calling you the Bad Guy. But 
until we get over the notion of Good and 
Evil Politics, the hysterical debate will 
rage on.

Professional Writing
Editor:
I am writing in re
gard to Jon Orris 
column concerning Letter to 
abortion (Conserva- t||0 Editor 
tives seek end to abor
tion, April 15). Mr. Orris makes some 
statements about the anti-abortion 
movement to which I would like to re
spond.
First of all, Mr. Orris writes that the 
anti-abortion movement places a higher 
value on a fetus than on a pregnant 
woman.
Regarding the anti-abortion 
movements attitude toward pregnant 
women, he writes that the fetuss rights 
become an unquestionable primary to 
which hers must be sacrificed.
Actually, most people opposed to abor
tion do not place a higher value on a 
fetus than on his or her mother.
However, they do believe that a fetus 
is a person, with rights which must be 
considered along with those of the 
mother.
A more prominent aspect of Mr. Orris 
column is his assertion that opposition 
to abortion is based on mysticism 
whereas, by implication, the pro-abor
tion position is based on pure reason. He 
writes: The argument that life begins 
at conception, therefore it must be pro
tected is false.
Those who advance this argument 
are ignoring the biological nature of the 
fetus, blurring the distinction between 
the potential and the actual, and ignor
ing the nature and source of rights.
I would like to consider the extent to 
which Mr. Orris defense of abortion is 
clearly rational.
First, he argues that opponents of abor
tion ignore the biological nature of the 
fetus.
Biologically, a fetus is a living human 
being. Whether it is a person with 
rights is another issue.
However, it is a human with a unique 
genetic code which, in the early weeks of 
pregnancy, develops its own organs, in
cluding a brain. It is attached to its 
mother and dependent on her, but it is 
not part of another persons body.
Second, Mr. Orris writes that a fetus is 
a potential human life and that this 
potential is not realized until birth. 
While a fetus is a human life, it could be 
argued that it is a potential person.
However, the belief that this poten
tial person becomes an actual person 
the moment it leaves its mothers body 
strikes me as no less mystical than the 
idea that personhood begins at concep
tion.
Personhood cannot be measured sci
entifically, and where it begins is a mat
ter of faith.
Conception seems to me as clear a 
natural boundary as any.
Finally, opponents of abortion are ac-; 
cused of ignoring the nature and source 
of rights.
However, I can think of only two pos
sible sources of rights.
Rights may be whatever is decided 
upon by society.
In that case, a womans right to an 
abortion and a fetus right to life are both j 
open for debate. If rights do not have a 
human source, we must appeal to a 
supernatural source; whether it is the. 
will of God or some philosophical ideal.
Abortion is a major debate in our soci
ety, and it will probably never be re
solved to everyones satisfaction.
However, for either side to call their ; 
opponents irrational or evil will not 
contribute to any kind of resolution.
We should instead try, as much aspossible, to listen with respect to people 
on both sides of the issue.

New PA regulations explained
Dear Members of the University Community:
I am writing to inform you of a change in Cam
pus Police procedure when responding to viola
tions of Pennsylvania law regarding the use of 
alcohol.
It is our goal to maintain the safety 
and security of the campus and rec
ognize the standards of the Carnegie 
Mellon community, as well as those 
of the Pittsburgh community. In the 
past, the Campus Police has used 
both internal and state citations in 
response to alcohol-related violations.
As of May 1, Campus Police will no 
longer use the internal citation pro
cess in these cases, relying solely on 
state citations for violations of the rel
evant law of the Commonwealth of Penn
sylvania. These laws are outlined in the 
Student Handbook, and we urge members of 
the community to familiarize themselves with 
them and ensure that no violations occur on the 
campus. State citations will be issued for sum
mary offenses. Summary offense for state viola
tions of alcohol-related actions do not carry a crimi
nal record for the person cited. They are, however, 
adjudicated through the District Magistrates Of
fice.
As is now the case, requests for medical assistance 
from Campus Police or EMS will be dealt with on an 
individual basis. In the absence of other 
violations ofUniversity policy, such 
i cases will result in a developmental 
? and educational intervention, nor
mally without the imposition of disj ciplinary sanction for the person in
volved. Members of the campus com
munity should always call Campus 
Police when they feel a student needs 
medical assistance.
They can be assured they will not be 
subjecting that student to disciplinary 
action if they do so.
If you have any questions, please contact me 
at x8-2327 or jlOi.
Sincerely,
James LaPaglia 
Director of Security
Film mirrors societal problem
Derek Robinson
I was the kind of person who 
cheered at the end of Natural 
Born Killers. Very few movies 
scare me. Violence has never both
ered me. Last week, however, my 
stomach churned. I saw the movie 
Fear. Why did I feel fear when I 
saw this movie?
Because the film was slightly 
more realistic than a James 
Bond-type performing death-de
fying acts to save the free world 
without mussing up his hair. Not 
that Fear was super-realistic, 
mind you, but it
forced you to say, --------------------
This could hap
pen in my back
yard!
Why does Fear 
Flit so close to 
liome?
Well, its your 
typical girl-fallsfor-boy-whohappens-to-bepsycho-and-ends-up-terrorizinggirPs-family-when-she-rejectshim Hollywood thriller. The thing 
that got to me, though, was the 
boys (wonderfully played by 
Marky Mark) wanton use of vio
lence and his general 
psychopathy. And Im talking 
strict psychopathy  total disre
gard for others in every respect.
The problem is that nothing 
can be done to prevent this type 
of behavior until after something 
criminal has happened. About 80 
percent of criminals are at least 
mildly psychopathic, and 20 per
cent are diagnosed as actual psy
chopaths. However, not all psy
chopaths are criminals, and there 
is ho 100 percent efficient test for 
psychopathy (mostly due to the 
fact that habitual lying is a com
mon characteristic of 
psychopathy).
Besides, this article isnt about
socialistic police work, its about 
protecting the innocent. That in
cludes those who are innocent 
until proven guilty, and who de
serve to be constitutionally pro
tected as much as the next per
son.
When crime happens, many 
after-the-fact retributions are 
enacted. This is superbly demon
strated by Bill Clintons old crime 
bill, which extended the death 
penalty to some additional crimes. 
The fact is, penalization is be
coming less and less of a deter
rent. There are so many holes in 
the legal system that it looks like 
a drive-by shooting victim. Sure, 
justice does get done sometimes, 
but the faith that used to preside 
in the integrity of the law is no 
longer present in modern-day
... crime baffles me. I can't conceive 
of killing, raping, stealing, etc. I 
dont know why it happens in the 
first place.
America. People know that some 
people are criminals, ruthless 
ones at that, but they feel noth
ing can be done. In most cases, 
nothing can; it is not up to the 
average citizen to do the job of the 
police force.
But head-turning is more 
prevalent than ever. People know 
ciime is common, yet they do noth
ing about it. Why?
Because they feel the power 
invested in them is strictly car
ried out by the government. If it 
doesnt get done, its the 
governments fault and only the 
elected politicians, our represen
tatives. That may be true, but 
will it matter when youre the 
next victim? When bills are 
stopped in the White House, the 
results are seen on Washington 
Avenue, where crime happens.
Regardless of whether you fa
vor big or little government, the
govemmentis becoming more and 
more useless and inefficient. Poli
ticians should work on being ef
fective, and not just seeming to 
be. Nobody needs to settle for 
anything less than the best.
I dont think the current state 
of things is anywhere near the 
best. Although it is an 
impossiblity for everything to be 
perfect, it is in our nature to evolve 
and improve.
I fear.
I dont think the police are a 
very reliable source of protection. 
I try my best to steer clear of 
danger, but I know the chance is 
always out there. I am not alone 
in these thoughts. Unfortunately, 
I currently dont know what would 
be the best solution to these prob
lems. I do know, however, that no 
one needs to
_______________ live in fear.
Crime can be 
curbed. Its not 
just govern
ment, its not 
just morals, 
its not just rec
ognition. I 
cant say what 
it is, because 
crime baffles 
me. I cant conceive of killing, 
raping, stealing, etc. I dont know 
why it happens in the first place, 
or why, we as a society, some
times seem to condone these hor
rors. I do know that all of them 
are wrong, these actions, and that 
there will never be justification 
for this type of behavior.
Safety is not what it used to be. 
This is a bigger issue than civil 
liberties; it is about the failure of 
government. Where has it failed?
In protecting its individual citi
zens. Ask yourself if your govern
ment is protecting you. In many 
ways it is. But if my article leaves 
no other impression on you, just 
ask yourself: Do I feel safe alone 
at night? Is this right?

Welcome to Cheap Shot 
Day. This is my chance to gen
erally offend as many people 
as I can (keep those letters to 
the editor coming!). As you read 
this, keep reminding yourself 
that Im considered the liberal 
on The Tartans editorial page! 
Here we go:
 I salute the hard work stu
dents put into this weeks Holocaust commemoration. 
Though there have been inci
dents of genocide through the 
ages, the Holocaust represents 
one of the blackest periods in 
our history and must never be 
forgotten.
But however wellintentioned the commemora
tion was, I have to question 
the presentation. It was calcu
lated to overwhelm the audi
ence the hundreds of names 
read and scores of markers 
planted, for instanceas if by 
being deluged with numbers, 
well somehow comprehend the 
horror. The reading was touch
ing last year when I hadnt 
seen anything like it before, 
but this year, it faded into the 
background.
Thats why in-your-face demonstrations typically dont 
have nearly as much impact as 
their organizers hope they will: 
The shock value wears off. A 
more targeted, personalized, 
and subtle approach would 
better honor the memories of 
the six million victims of the 
Holocaust.
 I was amused by the sign 
in front of Doherty Hall that 
said rapes on campus were 
going unreported because of 
legal glitches.
Just which legal glitches 
would those be? The glitch 
that the accuser has to press 
charges against the. accused in 
order for the rape to be re
ported (and thus make it into 
the crime statistics)? Or the 
glitch that the accused is in
nocent until proven guilty? 
Unfortunately, those so-called 
glitches are written into the 
American legal system and 
guaranteed by the Constitu
tion (the Fifth and Sixth 
Amendments, I think).
Women need to feel empow
ered to confront their attack
ers, and we need to stop stig
matizing rape victims and start 
protecting them better when 
they do press charges. Im not 
entirely sure how, but I do 
know that its not done by com
plaining about non-existent 
legal glitches, as if theres 
some conspiracy against rape 
victims. Lets work at curing 
the disease and not the symp
toms.
* Another Sweepstakes
passed without any casualities. 
Someday, someone should use 
their SURG to figure out just 
when, exactly, buggy became a 
bloodsport.
It wasnt always that way. If 
you go back far enough, youll 
see pictures of buggy races 
where people were actually  
oh my gosh  smiling! Even 
the losers, as if they were hav
ing a good time and werent 
taking things too seriously.
But that was before the win 
at any cost mentality that char
acterizes CMU infected Carni
val. Instead of cutting loose, we 
mark Carnival with four weeks 
of intense round-the-clock ac
tivity that culminates in drink
ing ourselves silly and falling 
asleep in a puddle of sweat and 
vomit. Oh, rapture. Work hard, 
play hard, my foot. *
Not everyone takes it so seri
ously, but enough people get 
crazy to taint the festivities. To 
them I say, relax. If your booth 
or buggy doesnt win, the sun 
will come up the next day (you 
may not see it, but its there), 
the world will continue to turn, 
and you wont die from embar
rassment.
 The Carnival car shuffle 
always proves just how bad the 
parking situation on campus 
really is. Arthur Hamerschlag 
probably got the first parking 
tickethere for leaving his Model 
T on Frew Street with the four
way flashers on. Isnt anyone 
ever going to address the prob
lem?
Theres a big sign on Forbes 
Avenue advising CMU visi
tors to park in the East Cam
pus Garage, but I defy any of 
them to find a space after 10 
am.
Commuters and visitors are 
treated as non-entities. Thats 
sad for visitors, considering ev
erything CMU has to offer to 
the community, and an outrage 
for commuters, given the fact 
that housing is so strapped for 
space that some residents were 
offered buy-outs this year!
You know that quality-of-life 
thing the University is having 
so much trouble figuring out?
I believe that being able to go 
to and from campus in a conve
nient manner fits in there some
where.
* Its election time again. Im 
voting for any candidate whos 
created jobs, is tough on crime, 
and wants to lower my taxes. 
Too bad the Easter Bunny isnt 
running; wed get free choco
late out of the deal, too.

Flat Tax program to cut out beauracracy
James Stepanek
Last week I talked about the mess that the 
current tax system is, and mentioned that Id 
review some of the alternatives this week, so 
fiere we go.
There are a number of proposed alterna
tives to the current income tax.
One of the most well known proposals is the 
Flat Tax. This was most publicized by Steve 
Forbes in his bid for the Republican nomina
tion, but he was not its only 
supporter.
These alternatives all are 
peant to simplify the system 
^hich, everyone can agree, has 
become a monster.
Since Ive mentioned Forbess 
Flat Tax plan, I may as well 
describe it. His plan consisted of
tax of 17 percent on incomes,
With a fairly high deduction, 
around $36,000 for a family of 
four.
Thats it.
No tax on capital gains, no tax 
on interest on savings, no screwthe-rich higher percentages, just
simple flat tax on everyone.
Your tax preparation would be 
s simple as subtracting the de
duction from your income and 
performing one simple multipli
cation.
The whole tax form could be a 
postcard, and you could complete 
4tin half a minute. Hows that for 
simple? Dick Armey, a congress
man from Texas, also proposed a plan quite 
similar to this before Forbes publicized his.
Of course there are nay-sayers to this plan. 
Th left, as we would expect, bemoans how 
^this would help the rich.
Well, it seems to me that all the plan would 
do is stop trying to screw the rich. In fact it 
would also put a bunch of high priced tax 
lawyers out of business, to which I doubt 
anyone could object.
People also object to how the plan would 
also get rid of the home interest mortgage 
deduction.
They claim that it would sink property val
ues because people wouldnt buy homes. This 
is possible if you assume people are that 
sshort-sighted, but then I guess Democrats 
'always assume people cant make good deci
sions with their money, which is why they are 
always trying to tax it away.
Personally, I find the notion that the gov
ernment must coerce you into making the 
right decision with your money (and this de
duction is a manner of coercion) extremely 
distasteful.
If one has common sense, one would see that 
building equity is always a better choice than 
renting, with or without a tax break from the 
government.
Also, with the cut in tax, rates proposed by 
those suggesting the Flat Tax system wouldnt 
really miss the mortgage deduction.
In fact, a friend of mine, who is currently 
using that deduction to the hilt, compared his 
taxes under the Forbes plan to the current
system and found the numbers to be about 
identical.
OK, in spite of these arguments, you say you 
still want that deduction because its nice to 
reward people for doing the right thing.
Well then, we can go with the Gramm Flat 
Tax plan or the Buchanan Flat Tax plan. Both 
of these set a tax rate around that of Forbess 
plan, yet allow deductions for mortgage pay
ments and charitable deductions.
I actually see the charitable deduction idea 
as a pretty good one since it will provide some 
cover for slashing welfare, but thats another 
issue.
These two plans, however, do tax capital
Liz Neuman/ Tartan Production Manager
gains, dividends, and interest on savings, 
though at the same low rate as Forbess plan.
This will make things a bit more compli
cated, but its still much simpler than the 
present mess. They would probably also be 
more palatable to voters due to peoples at
tachment to the mortgage deduction, which 
has become ingrained into the taxpayers 
psyche.
So are these the end of the options for 
changing the system?
No, there are a few more. Theres the plan 
favored by Dick Lugar (and Bill Archer) which 
is that of a national sales tax. This would be 
much like that employed by the states to raise 
revenue.
It would be set around 20 percent on goods, 
probably with exceptions made for necessi
ties. Why is this tax appealing?
Well, first of all, it will flat out kill the IRS 
as we know it. There would be no more prying 
into your income by the government, no more 
audits, and no more withholding from your 
paycheck. Overall, the flat tax would simplify 
our beuracracy immensely, in one fell swoop 
of a pen.
What coul be better than the fall of the IRS, 
you ask? Well, youd get all the money you are 
paid, and if you wanted to, you could save the 
vast majority and pay almost no taxes (youd 
probably pay tax on rent, and a couple of 
luxuries).
This plan would greatly encourage savings, 
an area in which the U.S. severely lags com
pared to the rest of the industrialized world.
It would also remove many of the current 
options for tax evasion. There would no longer 
be the option of paying someone under the 
table, since everyone would be paid that way.
This tax would also nail black marketers, so 
your local crack dealer would get to pay the 
taxes to help put him out of business (though 
I prefer drug legalization; the irony of this does 
have its appeal).
Of course this plan does have its problems in 
terms of what to exempt, and how to prevent 
us from getting both this tax and an income 
tax.
It would also require the repeal of the 16th 
Amendment, and amending the Constitution 
is a lengthy ordeal.
Of course, in the face of all these proposed 
reforms, the Democrats had to offer an 
alternative. As with most of their ideas 
these days, it was just a re-hash of what 
theyve said before. Richard Gephart, mi
nority leader of.Congress, suggested his 
own flat texr 
Of course, being a liberal, doublespeak 
was the centerpiece. The tax was nowhere 
near flat. It consisted of five different brack
ets ranging from 10 percent to 34 percent, 
with a whole host of deductions.
Oh yeah, thats a ton of simplification. 
One doesnt have to look far to see why the 
Democratic party is currently bankrupt 
on ideas.
One major complaint about most of the 
above reforms (I dont count Gepharts 
since its hardly a reform) is that they 
would cut the revenue base too much and 
worsen the deficit.
First of all, the government spends far 
too much money anyway, so putting the 
feds on a diet would be a good thing (the 
U.S. government spends around a fifth of 
. the GNP).
Secondly, most of the calculations which 
predict revenue losses due to these tax re
forms are based on static models. They as
sume that changes will have no effect. This is 
simply stupid.
How can you assume that a reform which 
increases investment and savings wouldnt 
cause an economic boom?
Reagan proved that this worked during the 
80s.
He cut taxes, and the economic boom which 
resulted increased revenues due to the larger 
economy.
To be quite honest, some reform is neces
sary. In addition to simply paying alarmingly 
high taxes, taxpayers pay up to around $30 
billion each year to have people prepare their 
taxes with the normal, time-consuming meth
ods.
This is a huge industry created just because 
the federal bureaucracy cant make anything 
simple. I really dont see the need for compli
cations, which is what these current systems 
are full of. Also, the federal government gets to 
pry into every financial transaction you make
 talk about big brother.
We need something to fix the morass which 
were in. The potential benefits in economic 
growth, individual freedom, and simple free
dom from annoyance are well worth the trouble 
of enacting such a reform.

Editor's Notebook
The Jews are a strong 
peopl. Last week, we 
were portrayed once 
again as weak victims. 
Yom Hashoah is a day 
designated to commemo
rate the six million Jews
who died in the Holocaust. Ceremonies held on Yom Hashoah 
last week, like the 24-hour name reading on the Cut, are 
moving, disturbing, visible, and effective.
Because the Holocaust was such an awesome part of his
tory, because so many millions of lives were affected, because 
it is one of the greatest tragedies in the history of the world 
with visual documentation, because people can make a public 
show of their support for survivors and museums, the Holo
caust is sadly becoming the defining moment in Jewish 
history.
Last week, I walked down the Cut without knowing about 
the plans for displaying portraits in honor of the Holocaust 
victims. Before reading the back of any of the placards staked 
into the ground, I saw the pictures and immediately thought: 
Holocaust.
The truth is, I didnt even think that the photos were for 
Yom Hashoah; I just thought they looked like typical Holo
caust photos.
When I read the card on the back of one of the portraits, I 
discovered that the pictures actually were from the Holo
caust.
I realized that if I automatically associated depressing 
pictures of malnourished, miserable people with the Holo
caust and Jews, so must many others, especially non-Jews.
To the world, as well as to many of our own people, the Jews 
are victims. Nothing about the Jewish people is as well 
known as the Holocaust. However, if the only reason to 
associate with a people is a common victimization, the initial 
and appropriate tie has been broken.
Two years ago I wrote a piece just like this one fuming at 
another Jew for saying he wanted to just get past the Holo
caust. I chastised him for being a bad Jew because to forget 
the atrocities of the Nazis is to allow the horror to happen 
again.
We cannot forgetespecially when the survivors will soon 
be gone, and with the Holocaust Revisionist movement grow
ing stronger with time. The Jews and the Gentile world must 
continue to learn about the Holocaust and the evil people who 
made the six million deaths possible. But there must be a 
balance.
No Carnegie Mellon student will have a more vivid picture 
of the Jews than from last weeks reading. The image: Jews 
are victims, they are depressed, they are dying, they are dead.
As Jews, we must show the world, and more importantly, 
ourselves, what our own history tells us. We are a proud 
people who can overcome any obstacle and persevere through 
any atrocity.
The Jewish people have ancient and beautiful traditions 
with which we should be identifying. Our customs about 
family .justice, and morality have been incorporated through
out the modern Western world. Our people are strong, not 
weak. We are beautiful, not ugly.
When remembering the Holocaust, please, let us try to 
dignify those who died with recognition of how weve kept 
Judaism alivea real Judaism based on our ancient history, 
laws, and beliefs  the one we all need to learn about more.
If we identify our Judaism only as something we once 
almost lost, it is already gone. The Jews are entering a new 
ear: an era without an enemy. Many wonder if we can survive 
without one. If we are to survive, it will because of what 
Judaism offers from within.
Eric Salzman is a junior philosophy major and personnel 
manager of The Tartan. He welcomes any responsible replies

CMU track athletes take on UAAs
By PAUL BOOTHE
Tartan Sports Editor
The Tartan mens and 
womens track team traveled to 
Case Western Reserve Univer
sity this past weekend to par
ticipate in the UAA Champion
ships, where the mens team
throw tied Summervilles pre
vious school record which was 
set earlier this year.
Several second-place finishes 
rounded out the scoring for the 
Tartan women. Junior Leslie 
Brown threw the discus 118'3" 
to take second place. Baustert 
added a 2:19.24 800-meter run
Rogish in the javelin to take 
second with a 185' throw. Sopho
more Rick Rikoski also turned 
in a second-place finish by vault
ing 13'6" in the pole vault.
Freshman Aaron Binkley also 
vaulted well, clearing 13' to take 
third in the event. Senior E.J. 
Tsangaris wrapped up the CMU 
field performances with a thirdplace finish in the shot put with 
a 43'6" throw. Junior Seb Zeisler 
placed third in the 10,000-meter 
run with a time of 13:29.
Womens coach Dario 
Donatelli was pleased with the 
teams performance and said, I 
thought we started out ex
tremely well on the first day ... 
we faded out a bit toward the 
end.
He also said that their per
formances were our best to date, 
by far but the competition was

Championships this past weekend.
claimed fifth place and the 
womens team claimed sixth.
The womens team delivered 
several record-breaking performances. Senior Melissa 
Baustert won the 1,500-meter 
run in 4:41.55 to set a new sta
dium record. In the field, junior 
Penny Summerville - won the 
javelin with a throw of 145'8", 
setting a new UAA record as 
well as a stadium record. This
to the weekend, taking second, 
and freshman Melissa Lott 
claimed second in the 5,000- 
meter run with a time of 18:56.2.
The mens team also turned 
in a number of highly impres
sive finishes. Junior Zack Conly 
won the high hurdles with a 
time of 16.43. Junior Jody 
Rogish hurled the javelin for 
190' even to win the event. 
Freshman John Stein followed

Panther Relays last week.
very tough. Donatelli said, No 
one is really dominating the 
conference anymore ... it was a 
dogfight the whole way.
Coach Donatelli is looking for
ward to next year, when CMU 
will be hosting the UAA Cham
pionships. He feels that hosting 
gives the team an advantage, 
as when youre gone [at UAAs] 
for three days, it wears on you. 
He is confident that the teams 
will be competitive again next 
year. He said, Our younger kids 
[freshmen and sophomores] ... 
did very well. We showed pretty 
well with them and were defi
nitely optimistic.
With the UAAs behind them, 
the next major event will be the 
NCAA National Championships 
at North Central College in late 
May. Summerville and Baustert 
have already qualified for the 
competition, but the 
team has a number of 
nthletes who are very 
close to qualifying for 
nationals.
There are three 
meets remaining in the 
season, and Donatelli 
is looking for a few 
more athletes to 
qualify, especially 
members of the mens 
javelin and womens 
distance squads.
Donatelli is confident 
that both Baustert and 
Summerville will be ex
tremely competitive at 
nationals. He said that 
right now, Summer
ville has the farthest 
throw in the country, 
and Baustert has one 
of the top times in the 
nation in the 1,500- 
meter run.
He said, They are 
top athletes in Division
III in their events, and 
they are poised and 
ready to compete at a 
national level.
The Tartans next 
meet will be this Sat
urday at BaldwinWallace College.
Crew medals in Philadelphia
By DAWN PAPUGA
Tartan Assistant Sports Editor
Coxswain, rower, sweep 
boats, scull boats, portside, and 
starboard. These arejustafew 
of the terms that are common 
to a select group of people here 
at CMU who call themselves 
the University Rowing Club, 
or to the regular student, the 
Crew team.
Crew is a technical sport, 
and without correct form, the 
boat is affected and goes 
slower, said sophomore Jon
athan Fantazier. Technical 
aspects are not always the most 
closely observed points to 
sports, and to understand crew 
you need to understand the 
terminology.
There are two different kinds 
of boats to row, sweep boats 
and scull boats. In the sweep 
boats, each rower has one oar, 
and in scull boats, each person 
has two oars. Sweeps can carry 
eight, four, or two people, while 
sculls can carry just one per
son, or teams of two or four.
This is a bit deceiving 
though, because there is an 
extra person in the larger boats 
with the rowers, called a cox
swain. A coxswain is the per
son at the bow, or the front, of 
the boat who is responsible for 
yelling the technical com
mands to the rowers.
When referring to the boats 
and the number of people in 
them, there are still terms to 
follow. A sweep with four 
people is only referred to as a 
four. Boats with two people are 
a bit more complicated. A 
sweep with two people is re
ferred to as a pair, and a scull 
with two people is referred to 
as a double.
To top it off, there are two dif
ferent levels of competition, Nov
ice and Varsity. Novice refers to 
the people who are in their first 
year competing in college.
Varsity refers to those who 
are in at least their second 
year or more. A little different 
than other sports, you need 
only to be on the team for more 
than a year to be on the varsity 
crew team.
Crew is not just a mens sport 
as it used to be  now there 
are many womens teams 
around, and CMU is one of 
them.
One of this years womens 
freshmen boats on the team, 
consisting of freshmen cox
swain Eva Tarbell and rowers 
Diana Yu, Ericka Fleckinstein, 
Joanna Wei, and Jen Moore, 
are doing well even though 
they have not participated in 
many races. The team placed 
third and won a bronze medal 
at its first official meet this 
season at the LaSalle Invita
tional, competing in the 
Womens Novice Four level.
The mens teams did well at 
LaSalle also. They had their 
mens Novice Four team (cox
swain freshman A1 Klein, row
ers freshman Julian Kinal, 
Fantazier, freshman Drew 
Stovall, and sophomore Ryan 
Rhoads) place second, wining 
a silver medal.
In the Mens Pair competi
tion, the boat of senior George 
Scott, and sophomore Klaus 
Moser placed first, claiming 
the gold medal for CMU. Se
nior Rick Gordan placed third 
and took the bronze for CMU 
in the Varsity Mens Single 
competition.
The CMU crew team has an
other meet on Saturday, April 
27 in Charleston, Virginia, and 
has two meets left before the 
end of the season.
On May 4, the team will be 
competing at the Mid Atlantic 
competition in Washington, 
D.C., and they will also par
ticipate in the Dad Vails tour
nament in Philadelphia from 
May 8-10.
Tennis teams wind down seasons at UAAs
By SUDHIR REDDY
Tartan Staff writer
The mens and womens tennis teams 
played in the UAA Championships this 
past weekend at the University of 
Rochester. T)he mens team finished 
seventh, while the womens team fin
ished fifth. Both teams had the same 
respective rankings when heading into 
the tournament.
Unlike the regular season, the first 
matches played were doubles matches. 
The match consisted of three doubles 
matches as the first team to win two 
matches was given one point.
Then the teams played singles 
matches; each singles match was worth 
one point. The first team to win four 
points won the match. Also, when the 
teams lost their first-round match,
they could not finish any higher than 
fifth place.
The womens team lost their first 
match against Rochester but finished 
strong by beating Case Western Re
serve University and the University of 
Chicago.
The .team suffered from the loss of 
freshman Karin Tuxen, their thirdseeded player, to an injury and was 
further hurt in the first^round by 
Rochesters addition of anotheTplay;er. 
Although the team had wanted to 
. avenge their loss to Rochester from 
last years tournament, the team was 
still proud of their seasons accom
plishments. ;
Senior Miriam Huang said, This 
team has a lot of potential to do well 
next season, since they will be retain
ing talented players. Although the

team will be losing two seniors next 
year, the team still benefits from the 
return of young, tal
ented players and an 
improved organiza
tional structure.
The mens team also 
lost to Rochester in the 
first - round. Although 
the match was close, 
the team didnt have 
the depth to compete 
~'With. Rochester.
The team was further 
hurt by having to play' 
part of the match out
doors in difficult, 
windy, conditions. Nev
ertheless, the team 
continued to play well 
throughout the rest of 
the tournament. After 
losing another close 
match to the Univer
sity of Chicago, the team 
defeated New York Uni
versity handily.
Team captain sopho
more Navroze Marshall 
said, We played well, 
but inexperience really 
hurt the team. We had 
three sophomores in 
the top positions.
However, since the 
team will not be losing 
any seniors this sea
son, it stands to do very 
well next year.
The mens team, 
which is 7-12 this sea
son, has one more 
match left in their sea
son. They play Grove 
City College at home 
on Tuesday, April 30.
The womens team is 
done with their season
 they were 146 be
fore their matchup against the Uni
versity of Pittsburgh last Tuesday.
Jason Siegendorf/Tartan Photo Editor 
The womens team expects to do well again next season, 
as they will be retaining a number of talented players.

Draft shapes 
NFL season
I hope to be like Jerry (Rice), 
Michael (Irvin), Herman (Moore), all 
three of them put together, said a 
confident Keyshawn Johnson, after the 
New York Jets made him the number 
one pick in the 1996 NFL draft. I 
dont think I am flashy, I think Im 
myself. I think Im just a nice guy. I 
dont have any problems with myself, 
added the 6'3", 220-pound wide-receiver, the first receiver taken with 
the first pick since 1984.
Johnson and the Jets represent this 
years loaded draft and sweeping 
changes in free-agency. The Jets have 
totally restructured their passing 
game, adding a receiver, two tackles, 
and quarterback Neil ODonnell 
through free agency, and drafting 
Johnson and fellow receiver Alex Van 
Dyke with their second-round pick.
Illinois teammates Kevin Hardy and 
Simeon Rice were taken with the sec
ond and third pick by Jacksonville and 
Arizona respectively. Hardy is the com
plete linebacker package. Last season 
he recorded 105 tackles, 11 sacks, three 
interceptions, forced five fumbles, and 
can drop back to play the pass. Rice is 
a strict pass rusher that strengthens a 
defensive line that already has two 
former pro-bowlers.
The Baltimore Ravens used their 
first pick ever to take Jonathan Ogden,

Reds owner destroys spirit of game
The Suicide Squeeze
by Anuj Gupta
Marge Schott... who is she? ... 
what is she?... and why is she the 
owner of a major league baseball 
team? Of course, these are all 
meant to be rhetorical questions, 
although any half-wit could con
ceive of answers. Her antics on 
and off the field continue to plague 
professional baseball at a time 
when it is crucial that it send a 
positive image to the fans.
The first incident involved her 
comments following the tragic 
death of Umpire John McSherry. 
She could not understand why 
the game was canceled after a 
man had just died from a heart 
attack during the first inning. Is 
there no trace of compassion in 
this woman?
The next incident involved 
shutting off the out-of-town 
scoreboard at Riverfront stadium 
so that it would save the team a 
mere $350 a month. Though that 
may sound like a good deal of 
money to you, me, and all other 
average Americans, the truth is
that it is simply pocket change in 
the world of professional base
ball  especially for an owner. 
She finally agreed to turn it back 
on, but her decision only came 
after making a ridiculous com
ment along the lines of, why would 
the fans want to see the 
scoreboard anyway? They are 
here to see this baseball game 
and I cant understand why they 
would be interested in any other 
games  not her exact words, 
but it is the same idea she was 
trying to convey.
Is there no way to shut her up? 
Cant the baseball money-mongers who so ruthlessly kicked out 
the commissioner, held the fans 
hostage for six months, and have 
defiled the game over the years 
do something?
Knowing that Bud Selig regu
larly reads this column, Im going 
to go ahead and make a direct 
and somewhat radical suggestion. 
It is time to make a test  one 
which all prospective owners, 
general managers, players, man
agers, scouts, etc. must pass in 
order to make baseball a career 
in any capacity. This test must 
demonstrate that they not only 
understand the game on the field 
and how they should conduct 
themselves off the field, but the 
history of the game as well. As 
political columnist George Will 
once wrote, baseball is like
church  many attend, but few 
understand. This test will sepa
rate the pretenders from the true 
defenders of the game. Of course, 
in Schotts case, the key question 
will be, Can a game be played 
without an umpire behind the 
plate? The sad truth is that she 
would probably fail.
On an entirely different topic, 
have you checked the standings 
lately? No... you do not have 
blurred vision and the effects of 
Carnival are long gone. The truth 
is that small markets are win
ning big  Montreal, the Bucs, 
Milwaukee, and Minnesota all 
are at or near the top of their 
respective divisions. I cant prom
ise that this will last. In fact, I 
promise that it wont. Neverthe
less, it is a refreshing sign in the 
day of the multi-million dollar 
free-agent signings that teams 
with some heart and a lot of hustle 
(typical Jimmy Leyland and Phil 
Garner style) can compete. Be
sides, all four of these teams are 
successfully on the way to re
building themselves, and one can 
expect them to either play .500 
ball this year (at least in the case 
of the Bucs), or to successfully 
play the role of spoiler. This can 
only mean one thing: revenue 
sharing equals winning teams.

and decison sciences major.

By PAUL BOOTHE
Tartan Sports Editor
In a competition sponsored by the Division III 
Cross Country Coaches Association, the Tartan 
mens cross country team had the second highest 
combined grade point average among all Division 
III schools. The teams combined average of 3.65 
for the fall semester tied them for second-place, 
behind California Institute of Technology.
Of the top seven runners for the Tartan team,
five maintained GPAs above 3.5, and one had a 4.0. 
Team members were freshman Joshua Donner, 
freshman Kristo Kriechbaum, junior Paul Hatala, 
sophomore Brian Ingram, junior Ron Polcawich, 
junior Greg Stults, and sophomore Seb Ziesler.
The top schools were ranked in the following order:
1. California Institute of Technology (3.83 GPA)
2. Carnegie Mellon University
2. Manchester College (tie  3.65 GPA)

NFL drafts prime picks
DRAFT, from page 9
hyped as the best offensive 
linemen in 15 years, while the 
Giants added pass rusher 
Cedric Jones with the fifth pick 
to their weak defense. The St. 
Louis Rams finally took 
troubled running, back 
Lawrence Phillips with the 
sixth pick, hailed as the most 
talented player in the draft.
The Patriots and Panthers 
shored up offensive weakness, 
taking underclassmen WR 
Terry Glenn and RB Tim 
Biakabatuka. Surprisingly, 
the Oakland Raiders traded 
up to take tight end Rickey 
Dudley with pick number nine 
and the Bengals rounded out 
the top ten with tackle Willie 
Anderson.
For the first time since 1988, 
no quarterbacks were taken 
in the first round.
Draft Winners:
St. Louis Rams  The 
Rams drafted five offensive 
players, none of them linemen,
in the first three rounds. Phillips 
is the type of talent that only 
comes around once every 10 
years. After bolstering their de
fense through free agency 
(signed DE Leslie ONeal, LB 
Robert Jones, retained CB Todd 
Lyght), the Rams address all 
their most pressing needs.
Miami Dolphins  Jimmy 
Johnson may have pulled off the 
two biggest steals of the draft 
for the Miami Dolphins. Miamis 
first pick (20th overall) under 
Johnson was the hugely talented 
(6'6", 320 pounds) defensive 
tackle Daryl Gardener.
In the third round, Johnson 
took defensive back Dorian Brew 
and RB Karim Abdul-Jabbar 
with back-to-back selections. 
Karim may be Johnsons next 
Emmit Smith.
Draft Losers:
Minnesota Vikings  First 
pick linebacker Duane Clemons 
is a solid selection, but overall a 
bad crop. They need a feature 
running back, and third-rounder
Moe Williams is not the an
swer. Quarterback Sean 
Salisbury was lost in freeagency and Warren Moon only 
has a few years left, but the 
Vikings didnt take a chance 
on a QB.
Pittsburgh Steelers  
They picked up Jerome Bettis 
to replace Bam Morris and in
vested their first choice to fill 
Leon Searcys gap, but what 
about other positions? This 
club is in trouble if Spence 
Fisher (selected number 203) 
is ODonnells replacement. Re
ceivers and secondary, once 
strengths, have been battered 
by injuries. They picked up 
only one wideout with a late 
pick, and no defensive backs to 
complement the aging secondary.
Chris Cannon is a sophomore 
computer science major. Un
fortunately, his Tartan duties 
kept him from accepting the 
Cowboys 54th round draft of
fer. Look for him to return in 
force in 97.

PiKA A men three-peat/ in first place
By JAMES STEPANEK
Tartan Staffwriter
Another exciting raceday has come and gone and 
its time to review the events. Pittsburgh, being that 
haven of beautiful weather that we all have come to 
love, did grant us two decent days to roll, but not 
without a bit of anxiety. It rained both mornings 
prior to races this Carnival, but the course was dried 
in time to enable the competition.
The first day of races began late, starting at 10:15 
with the womens heats, followed by the mens races. 
The first heat was initially scheduled to be Beta B by 
themselves, but they managed to muster a D team. 
Needless to say, the heat was not even close, with a 
10 second separation at the finish line.
The next heat featured Fringe B, SDC B, and 
Sigma Nu B. The race up the front hills was won by 
SDC, and Sigma Nus buggy never caught up. SDC 
came in with a 2:19.62, which would grant them a 
place in the next days races.
Heat three consisted of DTD B, PiKA C, and KDR 
B. This one was not even close. PiKA C simply 
smoked the others all the way around. They won the 
up and over, tore away on the roll, and came in at 
2:20.68, which narrowly missed the second day's 
(Jompetition.
The fourth heat had Sig Tau B, Phi Kap B, and 
Pioneers A facing off. Both Phi Kap and Pioneers 
had been showing much promise, and this wasan 
exciting heat. Pioneers proved to have the stronger 
team, however, wininng the heat handily with a 
2:15.95. Phi Kap B came in second with a 2:18.10. 
Both of these times were good enough for secondday qualification.
The fifth heat featured Spirit C vs. DU A. DU 
managed to put up a good fight up the front hills but 
was blown away on the roll to the chute. Spirit C 
spun its buggy going into the chute. The DU driver, 
followinglater, stopped the buggy to avoid a collision 
and was granted a reroll at the end of the days races.
The next heat featured SDC A, rounded out by 
Beta C and Kappa Sig B. SDC won the heat with a 
very good showing on the hills and a fast roll giving
them a time of 2:13.35. Beta C beat their B team, 
with a time of 2:19.28.
Heat seven featured Sigma Nu A, KDR C, and 
PiKA B. This commentator expected a close race 
but was disappointed by the Sigma Nu teams loss 
in the up and over to PiKA B, who commanded the 
whole heat. There was some catch-up managed by 
the Sigma Nu on back hills, but it was nowhere near 
enough to close PiKAs lead. PiKAs push team 
surely wasnt hurt by their amazingly fast buggies. 
PiKA and Sigma Nu both managed to land a spot in 
the second days races. KDR C was not really in the 
race.
Heat eight saw Spirit B, SDC C, and Pioneers B 
going head to head. This was another example of 
not-even-close competition. Spirit B dominate^ Mie

heat and blew away the competition. They kept 
ahead in the roll and just smoked on the back hills. 
The final time for Spirit was a 2:15.45, nine seconds 
ahead of Pioneers B, who came in second in the 
heat.
The ninth heat also featured only one contender, 
Phi Kap A, who ran against DTD A and SDC C. DTD, 
once having been a dark horse contender in buggy, 
has slipped into the realms of the also-rans. Phi 
Kap, not surprisingly, commanded the heat the 
whole way. They finished well ahead of DTD, with a 
time of 2:13.30.
The 10th heat featured Sigma Nu C, Fringe A, and
Jeff Polega pushes the PIKA mens A team buggy, 
Mad Dog, along Hill 5 toward victory.
one of the expected contenders for first- place, Spirit 
A. As we would expect, Spirit A won the up and over, 
but due to poor driving spun the buggy in the chute. 
The buggy was there munching on hay bales as 
Sigma Nu C came rolling through well ahead of 
Fringe A, which is another team that has lost com
petitor status.
Heat 11 was due for the appearance of PiKA A, the 
team to beat and holder of the trophy for the past two 
years. Many had discounted their chances this year 
due to rumors of a weak push team, but this com
mentator never bought into those stories, and PiKA 
certainly proved me right. They faced off against 
KDR A and Sig Tau A. Neither of the latter teams 
were really in the race. PiKA rolled a completely 
amazing freeroll, which blew out all the competition
by around 1.5 seconds (this is freeroll time, not 
course time). They came in with a blazingly fast time 
of 2:08.47, which left them with a monstrous lead 
over second place.
The last heat of the day had Beta A, with a very 
strong push team and a new buggy, TJnforgiven, 
facing off against Kappa Sigma A and Theta Xi A 
Beta was considered by many to be a contender this 
year considering their improvements in buggy tech
nology (which featured the adoption of the Jama 
style of buggy). They easily won the up-and-over and: 
managed a pretty fast roll. On making the chute 
turn, however, their tires simply shredded in a 
chemical haze, causing what was a nice turn by the 
driver to become a spin. Kappa Sigma ended up 
winning the heat, with a time of 2:25.19.
There was one heat remaining, the DU re-roll. 
They rolled in a heat by themselves but didnt finish 
due to a blowout of one of their pneumatic tires 
causing a wreck in the chute. The buggy actually 
flipped over and then righted itself. The driver was 
uninjured.
The interim between the first and second day 
featured a number of attempted rules maneuverings, 
including attempts to disqualify PiKA B for a false 
start and lane violations, which didnt work, and a 
claim of pacing by Phi Kap, which somewhat worked. 
Phi Kap was disqualified for a while, but a review re
instated their slot for the second day. This resulted 
in 11 teams racing on day two because it was felt to 
be unfair that Beta B, after being told they were in, 
would have been bumped out.
The second dayalso began late due to early morn
ing thunderstorms. The course did dry out in time for  
races (with a bit of help from cars driving through the 
course). The first heat featured Beta B rolling by! 
themselves. The roll was not an extremely fast one, 
and the team put in a time of 2:17.94.
Heat two saw Spirit B going against SDC B. This1 
race was easily commanded by Spirit with a clear 
win up and over the hills, and a breaking away in the 
free roll. Spirit managed to clock in a respectable 
time of 2:12.90, which would prove to be the time to

A wet weekend made for fast and 
exciting competition in the 1996 
Sweepstakes races. Drivers, pushers, 
and mechanics wandered the race
track, trying to keep their concentra
tion for the three-hour delay due to 
bad weather.
Organizations speculated 
on how the conditions of the 
course would affect their per
formance. As chase cars wove 
along the damp course in a 
desperate attempt to beat the 
10:30 deadline to start the 
races, several drivers were 
hanging close to the trucks.
Kappa Sig driver Vicky 
Carlisle had no fears, Ive 
got pneumatic tires, Im not 
gonna spin! Beta driver Beth 
Abramson added with gusto,
Rain or shine, Im there to 
drive for a great organization 
like Beta. Kristen Williams, 
driver for Sig Tau, said, Im 
 not scared, just really ex
cited!
The fever of preliminaries 
made for an amazing hour of 
womens races. The top six 
womens teams would be cho
sen for Race Day. The over
whelming favorites were 
i Spirit, Sigma Nu, and Pioi neers, and those three teams finished 
. one after another to qualify for finals. 
With 10 seconds between Sig Nu and 
Spirit, there was no question that the 
women in gold were racing to break 
their own record from last year.
There were some complications with 
; womens preliminaries. DTD A had a 
five-second delayed start, PKT A had 
brake problems, Sig Nu B and Pika A 
j didnt make the starting line, and SDC 
, B spun out. But the teams for Satur
day morning were set with SDC A,
Beta A, and Spirit B rounding out the 
top six finishers.
Race Day presented the same 
weather complications to the buggy 
teams. Once again, pushers and driv
ers stretched for hours trying to keep 
loose. The Spirit women, the only or
ganization whose women qualified two 
teams for race day, paced in front of 
the trucks at the base of Tech Street.
Im excited about the way the team 
has been working and training hard. 
Well be racing against ourselves to
day, against last years record of 2:33. 
We want to drop times on all of the 
hills. The B team has really done an 
excellent job, they are all new pushers 
and were proud of them, said Shan
non Gibney, Spirit As Hill 5 pusher.
Closest behind Spirit in the womens 
running was Sigma Nu A. Pusher Holly

Awards ceremony 
recognizes winners
By CHRIS CANNON
Tartan Assistant News Editor
The 1996 Spring Carnival came to an end with an animated 
awards ceremony. The Carnival Committee started handing out 
weii earned awards at 7 pm in the Midway tent. Winners were 
announced for best T-shirts, booths, and buggies. Like last years 
ceremony, most awards were received graciously, but there were a 
few sour apples.
Sigma Alpha Epsilons Mousetrap placed third in fraternity cat
egory for booth. Their representative that accepted the award was 
clearly disappointed and let the audience know about it. The crowd 
briefly booed when he said, We know who really won. SAE also won 
the Chairpersons Choice award for their booth.
Phi KappaTheta won second for their Return of the Jedi booth and 
Delta Upsilon won first for their elaborate Crossbows and Catapults 
design. Phi Kapps booth was a rendition of Jabba the huts sand ship 
while DU showed off their booth building talent with an intricately 
carved castle.
Zetas Boggle won first place in the sorority competition. The booth 
used giant Boggle cubes and gave away notepads, pencils, and 
erasers. Kappa Kappa Gamma won secondwith their Sharpshooters 
booth and Kappa Alpha Thetas Connect Four booth won third.
KGBs Kremlin won third place and their enthusiasm was clearly 
evident from their loud cheers that captured the spirit of Carnival. 
The Crowd cheered wildly for the Korean Student Associations 
second place booth Weapons and Warriors and Asian Student 
Associations first place Dizzy Dizzy Dinosaurs.
This years booth winners are now the owners of traveling trophies, 
much like the mens and womens buggy awards. Overall, there were 
fewer awards than last year. Absent were an Environmental Booth 
award, the Peoples Choice Award.
Pi Kappa Alpha won a best T-shirt design for the third year in a 
row. Their booth T-shirt victory comes off consecutive buggy T-shirt 
wins. Sigma Nu won for best buggy T-shirt design.Student Dormi
tory Councils brand new buggy, Rage, won best buggy design, while 
last years winner Haraka from Spirit came in second. Sigma Nus 
Okapi garnered third place.
When PiKA was announced for winning their third consecutive 
mens buggy championship, their A-team took that stage with 
the driver on a brothers shoulders. PiKA easily outpaced second 
place Spirit B by over four seconds. While only one B-team took 
home a trophy last year, the trend was reversed during this 
Carnival. Surprisingly, B-teams took home four of the six mens 
trophies. Phi Kapp A, PiKA B, Beta B, and SDC B rounded out the 
top six.
On the womens side, Spirit A repeated last years convincing 
performance with a 15 second margin of victory. Spirit pusher 
Shannon Gibney accepted the trophy for her team. Independent 
organizations continued to dominate the womens field as Pioneers 
A and SDC A took second and third.
PiKA and Spirit were also awarded plaques for last years mens 
and womens victories respectively.
PiKA men remain undefeated
PiKA, from page L2
beat for quite a few heats. SDC B 
came in with a time of 2:18.20.
Heat three saw Beta C against 
PiKA B. PiKA managed to win the 
up and over, and managed to gain 
groundinthe freeroll, though their 
roll time was not what they man
aged the day before. On the back 
hills Beta managed to erode some 
of PiKAs lead, but the distance 
was too great, with PiKA clocking 
a let down time from the first day 
of 2:16.66, and Beta reporting a 
2:23.35.
Heat four featured Phi Kap B 
against SDC A. SDC handily won 
the run up the front hills, but 
their buggy didnt gain any ground 
in the freeroll. The SDC A hill 5 
pusher just bumped the buggy 
one time too many, and even with 
a herculean effort diving for the 
pushbar at the end, didnt man
age to catch it.
They were disqualified at the 
line. This was a major heartbreaker since their time would 
have landed them second, place 
2:12.82. Actually, this was a 
cursed heat for all involved since 
a review showed that Phi Kap B 
had a false start which disquali
fied them as well.
Heat five saw Sigma Nu A vs. 
Phi Kap A. Due to a level of incom
petence, the timers managed to 
botch the starting mark twice in a 
row.

The heat finally began with Phi

Phi Kap commanded the whole 
race with the lead built up on Hill
1. Sigma Nu actually rolled a very 
disappointing freeroll time com
pared to the first day. Phi Kap 
came in with a time of 2:13.79, 
which wasnt quite enough to edge 
out Spirit B. Sigma Nu A clocked 
in a poor showing of 2:20.47.
The last heat of the day was 
now to come. This was the most 
important, featuring PiKA A who 
had blown away all the competir 
tion the first day of races. They 
faced off against Pioneers A. PiKA, 
as we would expect, tore ahead on 
the front hills and smoked Pio? 
neers in the freeroll. Their buggy, 
Mad Dog, had the fastest free roll 
time of races.
They simply opened up their 
lead every chance they got, and 
turned in atime.of2:08.15, which 
put them well ahead of the com
petition.
Pioneers managed to drop a 
piece of their push bar, and by the 
rules this gave them a DQ even 
though their time of2:15.78 would 
have given them a respectable 
slot amongst the finishers.
The end result was PiKA A get
ting the first place trophy, Spirit B 
coming in second, Phi Kap A third} 
PiKA B fourth, Beta B fifth and 
SDC B sixth. It seems PiKA is 
starting a new buggy dynasty simi
lar to the one they managed in the 
70s.
Its going to take someone get
ting their act together in a major 
way to shake the four-second lead 
they posted this Race Day.

Board games inspire amusing booths for carnival
By TRICIA DAVIS
Tirtan Staffwriter
The booths really captured the 
spirit of CMU this year. The inno
vative designs and complex struc
tures made it difficult for _ 
anyone to predict who would 
wiin the competition. Of 
course, there were a few 
people confident of a winner.
i I think were going to win. 
Definitely, said Patrick 
Cbnlin, sophomore english 
major and member of ASA.
iConlin was right. ASAs _ 
Dizzy Dizzy Dinosaur booth 
won first place in the Inde
pendent category. Their artwork 
was impressive, especially the 
large purple dinosaur with the 
green spots. For prizes,
ASA gave away Dino 
stickers, Dino candy, and 
Dino balls.
My favorite about 
building booths is the way 
that everyone really 
comes together, Conlin 
said. Its a real bonding 
experience. My advice to 
anyone thinking about 
building a boothstart 
erly. We spent about 400 
hours putting oui booth 
together.
Zetas booth, Boggle 
won first place in the So
rority category. Zetas gi
ant Boggle cubes grabbed 
everyones attention. To comple
ment their Boggle theme, they 
gave away notepads, pencils, and 
erasers. Despite the heavy rain, 
that members say almost ruined 
their booth, Zeta repaired it, and 
came in first place.
I like ... the brotherly 
love .... Its a guy 
bonding thing.

tects and theater and design 
majors. They already knew how
to work with tools and they knew 
how to build structures that could 
stand.
SAE came in third in the frater
nity category with their Mouse
trap. The large Mousetrap game 
_ attracted much attention as 
did the giant mouse that lead 
visitors to SAEs creative 
booth. The prizes, headbands, 
were handmade by the mem
bers themselves.
Chris Jenkins, a brother of 
SAE and freshman H&SS 
major said, We spent about 
14 hours a day for the last two 
 weeks. Its my first time doing 
booths and I think the tradi
tion is pretty cool. Its a good 
feeling.You have to keep your 
heart in it and dont get frustrated 
if it doesnt work, said 
Bobby Debgupta, a 
sophomore Mech E and 
brother of SAE. I like 
how the community 
bonds together. You get 
to know people that you 
didnt know that well 
before.
KKG won second 
place with their Sharp
shooters booth. The 
booth looked like an 
old-fashioned western 
saloon. As prizes, they 
gave shot glasses in
scribed with Kappa 
Kappa Gamma; and 
squirt guns for little kids.
Jackie Autieri, a sohpomore
Chem E and one of KKGs booth 
chairs, said, Try to plan every
thing out before you get out here. 
Overestimate in the cost and the 
materials. You need a lot of pa
tience. Overplan for everything 
because something always goes 
wrong.
DTDs giant Cootie drew in Car
nival visitors with its impressive 
bug that stood out from almost 
every other booth. Once inside, 
game players won candy prizes 
for their successes in Plinko, an
other popular board game. I like 
how everyone comes together and 
helps out. We started working on 
it a couple of weeks ago and it 
went together pretty fast, said 
Dave Fredericks, DTD brother.
PiLams booth featured the 
game Plinko as well.
Spirits booth, Fast Ills seemed 
to be a winner with children, as 
they walked away with toy prizes 
as well as candy. We started lay
ing down the palettes and fireproofing over a week ago, said 
McNeal Maddox, sophomore de
sign major and booth chair of 
Spirit. There have been a lot of 
long nights, like we were out until 
4 oclock in the morning just last 
night. The only problems weve 
had is DTDs Styrofoam blowing 
all over the place and getting stuck 
in the paint. The palettes were 
donated by the University and 
were going to give those back. Get 
a lot of help if youre thinking 
about doing booths.
I like the camaraderie and 
brotherly love. And getting out 
and doing stuff, said Kevin 
Stanley, a brother at DTD and a 
senior MS and E major. Its a 
guy bonding thing.
In the Independents Category 
the winners were as follows: third 
place went to KGB for their 
Kremlin booth; second place went 
to KSA for their Weapons and 
Warriors booth; and first place 
went to ASA for Dizzy Dizzy Di
nosaurs.
In the Sorority Category the
winners were as follows: third 
place went to Kapp a Alpha Theta 
for their Connect Four booth; sec
ond place went to KKG for their 
Sharpshooters booth; and first 
place went to Zeta for Boggle? - 
In the Fraternity Category, 
third place went to SAE for their

went to PhiKap for their Return 
of the Jedi booth, and first place 
went to DU for Crossbows and

It wasnt until about one

was time to mudslide. For 
years, after Saturday 
buggy races, brave souls 
head out to the grass be

Mudslide. The truth is 
that only a few people slide 
naked, and these people 
are probably regretting the 
act right about now. (Lots

No one seems particu

even profess 15 or 
more. Well, Ive been

Janine Coppola went to the 
Fraternity Quad with a 
couple of campus police of

Bosstones play a mighty good concert
By BRADLEY ZIMMERMAN
Tartan Staffwriter
Its a plaid, plaid, plaid world....
As promised, the Mighty Mighty Bosstones gave 
tlie organizers of Spring Carnival the biggest 
reason to smile. As the Doherty clock neared the 
scheduled 3 pm starting time, the Cut was 
blanketed with an estimated audience 
of1,400. Needless to say, this figure 
eclipses most former Carnival 
performers. Being a free show 
advertised throughout Pitts
burgh, the outdoor event 
drew not only CMU stu
dents, but people from all 
areas of the city, showing 
; wjiat Carnival is really about.
Due to some technical prob
lems involving the one-day con4 struction of the outdoor stage, the 
 show began about 45 minutes late, but 
the preceding soundcheck provided some 
entertainment with various band members mak
ing fun of each other through the microphones. 
The Cherry Poppin Daddies, the lukewarmly 
received openers set new records for geekiness in 
a ska band (its a compliment) with their rubbert band vocalist and his shirt covered in red hearts. 
: Their songs did prove to be an excellent prelude to 
the Bosstones, however, with such gems as 
Punchable Face Club inciting a dance circle
lasting about 12 rows.
As the Bosstones hit the stage, the crowd filled 
in but allowed room for dancing, breathing, and 
other necessary functions. We figured since we 
couldnt fit all of 
you into
from their latest, Question the Answers. It was 
obvious even from this early in the set that people 
were going to lose a lot of weight from sweating. 
The Bosstones soon began grabbing people from 
the audience to 
dance
the Metropol, 
we should come 
back and do this outdoors tiling, 
said vocalist Dicky Barrett (who unabashedly loves 
Pittsburgh) to the crowd, which by now reached as 
far back as the Fence. The set started with a new, 
unreleased track and segued into Kinder Words
onstage
Courtesy of Mercury Records with Ben Bosstone, the
member whose sole purpose in 
the band is to dance.
This practice began a parade of eccentrics rang
ing from Megan, who was so flabbergasted that she 
kept losing the beat to Hell of a Hat, to a guy who
was told that if he was going to dress that goofy, he 
shouldve expected to be pulled onstage; and a sad 
lad who tried to tell Dicky that he was West Coast 
Rude, to which Dicky snapped I aint ever seen a 
Rude Boy in a frat hat.
All the big songs got their turn  Saxophonist ' 
Johnny Vegas goofy crooning ode to Chocolate" 
Pudding, Whered You Go, and the Marley ' 
cover Simmer Down, along with the" 
manic, pit-happy sing-along skank- i  
of Someday I Suppose. How--' 
ever, the biggest surprise^ 
of the day came with the1- 
hyperactive anti-evan-1^ 
gelical Holy Smoke, an 
supersonic blast of ska-" 
core that defines the1' 
genre.
Finally, as the set wounds 
down with Cowboy Coffee,- 
it was obvious from the hordes^ 
of grinning, sweat-soaked two*'0 
tones that the hour-and-20-minute per
formance was undoubtedly the apex of' 
Spring Carnival. Seeing such a conglomeration of . 
punks, greeks, goths, hippies, skaters, normalsj ' 
and rude boys on the lawn with few to no security j 
problems just says something about the event and I 
the music itself.
And if anyone says anything about it, just keep 
in mind the hallowed words of Saint Dicky: I was 
Dunk before vou were.

Band breaks traditional Indie rock
By NEEL DONNELLY
Tartan Staffwriter
Its fairly safe to say that when you go 
to a S.W.O.B. show, you wont leave in 
the same condition as when you arrived. 
Well, let me rephrase that: Its safe to 
say that when 7 go to a S.W.O.B. show, I 
never leave in the same condition as 
when I arrived.
S.W.O.B. is quite a unique experience 
that can hardly be depicted accurately 
through a medium as confining as print. 
The band has been playing together for 
a number of years, but ever since Steve 
Boyle assumed the role of front man 
. over a year ago, S.W.O.B. has gained a 
new land of notoriety in the Pittsburgh
indie scene. Boyle, an eccentric man in 
his late 20s with a receding hairline and 
horn-rimmed glasses, has become infa
mous for his on-stage antics and mania
cal, ranting lyrics.
When S.W.O.B. took the stage last 
Thursday night at the Spring Carnival 
Midway, I was prepared for an unusual 
evening; the last time I saw S.W.O.B., at 
the Oakland Beehive, Boyle ended the 
bands set by hurling dirt at the crowd, 
and I happened to be the lucky one on 
the receiving end of a large amount of 
tops oil.
Soon after S.W.O.B. began their set of 
blistering, experimental noise-rock, 
Boyle wrapped himself in a blue plastic 
tarp, and he saijvg most of the first song
from beneath this shroud. When Boyle 
crawled out from under the tarp, he 
strapped on a guitar and played it as 
only he (and maybe Sonic Youth) can  
with lots of implements that were never 
meant to be anywhere near a guitar. 
Boyle used everything from a metal ring 
to a wooden paint stir to coax anguished 
screams and squeals from his instru
ment, and the other three members of 
the band laid down a very solid instru
mental foundation for Boyles crazed 
antics. Boyle prefaced Cookie For 
Snack by saying, This is an old Alice in 
Chains song. Its called Fraternities in 
Flames.  To the puzzlement and horror 
of many booth-builders and passers-by 
(and the rapt excitement of those of us
who were there to see S.W.O.B. and not 
a bunch of oversized board games), Boyle 
launched into another of his psychotic 
sermons with a point that is probably 
only truly clear to him.
Toward the end of the set, Boyle began 
the compulsory audience-abuse portion 
of the show. He grabbed a length of rope 
and a can of whipped cream and strolled 
into the crowd, making me his victim. 
After deciding that it wasnt worth his 
time to tie me up, Boyle layered the back 
of my head in whipped cream and then 
threw the can at the ground, allowing it 
to spew forth a slight stream of whipped 
cream on its own accord. He then made 
his way back to the microphone to con
tinue his skewered diatribes.
barriers
Whether you appreciate the hyperac
tive, ear-splitting genre-genocide of. \ 
S.W.O.B., or you agree with one on- j 
looker who, after ordering the band to 
play some Skynyrd, called the band 
trash, they will definitely leave a strong I 
impression on you. In my case, it was 
dessert topping trickling down my neck i 
and a sense that I had just witnessed a 
band with no fear of offending or break- \ 
ing down traditional barriers (something ; 
that Carnival, in general, is in dire need 
of). S.W.O.B. provided a badly needed 
dose of iconoclasm to the CMU commu- \ 
nity.
And after all, isnt the destruction osocietal convention part of what college 
is all about?

Bands offer a variety of music for Spring Carnival
Kiltie Band
By PAUL BOOTH
Tartan Sports Editor
The Tartan Kiltie Band kicked off Carnival with style at their 
annual Spring Concert. Held in the Midway tent right after the 
Carnival opening ceremonies, the band marched in to the attentiongetting cadence that residents of Donner, West Wing, and Resnick 
know and love. The band, under the direction of Paul Gerlach, 
quickly got down to business, opening with a march entitled Vaquero by Sammy Nestico. They then launched into Introit and 
Celebration by Tom Mitchell, followed by March and Procession of 
Bacchus by Leo Delibes. The band then paid homage to the great 
Leonard Bernstein with a selection of pieces from the musical West 
Side Story. Director Gerlach yielded the baton to the Kilties own L. 
Ray Strobel, a graduate student in music, so that he could direct the 
band in his own composition, Reflect and Rejoice. Director Gerlach 
then returned to lead the band in the fourth movement from Grand 
Serenade for an Awful Lot of Wind and Percussion, composed by the 
questionable master, P.D.Q. Bach. True to its name, this piece 
explored the musical ranges of an awful lot of wind instruments, and 
featured solos on some of the lesser known percussion instruments 
such as the pair of two-by-fours and the cap gun.
They then closed with Hands Across the Sea, a piece by John 
Philip Sousa. The Kiltie Band wrapped up its final concert for the 
year by demonstrating their choral skill with a number of CMU and 
Carnegie Tech fight songs, including Fight for the Glory of Carnegie.W

Steel Impressions provided entertainment with Caribbean music.
Steel Impressions
By AMIT KAR

SE
\ In order to whet our appetites for next falls International Festival 
focusing on Latin America and the Caribbean, the Spring Carnival 
Committee did us all the great favor of having Caribbean music before 
tjie Steel Impressions had struck even one note. However, the bands 
unique mixture of Caribbean beat, West African rhythm, androckabilly 
proved to be irresistible. In par
ticular, the bands treatment of 
Rock Around the Clock was taste
ful, unique, and very much Carib
bean, without robbing it of its 50s 
flavor. Though the audience was 
largely sitting at the start of the 
performance, its members were 
gilding it increasingly hard to reiftain still as the performance went 
on.
I In addition, Steel Impressions 
laid-back, unpretenious, and de
cidedly cool approach endeared 
them even further to those watch
ing. The result was an excited 
(Jrowd of people, some of whom 
Vere dancing, some of whom were 
fobbing their heads, all of whom

bring them back in the fall.
1964: The Tribute
By DAVID ELMAN
Tartan Staffwriter
Its only once in a rare while that you get the chance to see a man 
that has passed away sing, but thats exactly what John Lennon 
did in the Midway tent at Carnival. For a brief period of time, the 
1963-1966 era Beatles were reborn on stage with all the accou
terments of their persona: the suits, the bulky haircuts, and the 
British accents.
As much as 1964: The Tribute try to be the Beatles, they are not 
and never will be their idols. My advice to them would be to come 
to their senses before they are all gone and do something else. 
Theyve already spent over ten years achieving their current 
level of impersonation, and will probably spend a great deal 
more perfecting the routine. The result is, however, quite close 
to the original.
The show itself was standard. All their hits from the period 
were played, including I Want to Hold Your Hand, A Hard 
Days Night, Love Me Do, Twist and Shout, and Cant Buy 
Me Love. The motley crowd reveled in the fact that they could 
see something at least resembling the Beatles and formed dance 
pits near the stage characterized by frantic dancing. Everyone 
seemed into the act, from those too young to know what they were 
seeing to college students to those who can remember when they 
saw the real thing. The high point of the concert was probably 
when everyone got up for Twist and Shout, the Beatles big 
contribution to party music. At this point, the performers hold on 
their audience was absolute and nothing could tear them away. 
Activity surged through the tent as more and more people got 
their bodies into motion.
1964: The Tributes vin
tage amps pumped out 
the tune as they fidg
eted around on stage us
ing technique most 
likely gained from long 
hours in front of a tele
vision.
The inherent flaw of 
any tribute band, not just 
a Beatles tribute band, is 
that they are a tribute 
band. Their whole exist
ence is devoted to trying to 
be something that theyre 
not. Rather than unleash 
their creativities, they in
stead decide to channel 
them into the ultimate test 
of meticulousness. In my 
humble opinion, the origi
nal will always be best and 
probably should not be 
tampered with.

Yard Dogs

Diana Bartolotta/ Tartan Photographer 
The tribute band went to great lengths to 
impersonate the legendary Beatles.
It is inevitable for the Yard Dogs to become a CMU tradition. Theyr 
have been playing at Scotland Yard since the beginning of the year, and l\' 
their three hour performance in front of a packed audience last 
Thursday will only help to make their name known.
Composed of freshman Shoheen Owhady on piano, freshman 
Brendan Bosworth on guitar, freshman Andy Artz on drums, anH 
Jim Kim, a Pitt student, on bass, the Yard Dogs are a culmination i 
of great talent and great music.
The Yard Dogs specialize in improvisational jazz, and regularly have i 
musicians sit in with them on sets. Thursday night, five musicians sat in 
with the band. Derek Davidson played both tenor and soprano saxo
phones on a few pieces, while Dave Drop sat in on alto. Both Dave Saenz !
and Chauncey Upson played tenor, and even combined their talents on a j
few of the last songs. Javier Sanchez-Buch also sat in on guitar.
The Dogs played well together, providing support for one another by ;
merging their own distinctive talents. This provided a stable backdrop ;
for the sit-in musicians, who were able to merge nicely with the band 
and still retain their individual styles.
For a band composed mainly of freshmen who have only been ;
together for a little less than a year, the Yard Dogs are well-versed in ;
the production of improv jazz. Last Friday night, they were at their ;
best, providing an evening of entertainment for all who ventured to |
Scotland Yard to see them. If you didnt get a chance to catch them, \
dont worry. The Yard Dogs have the potential to become a Scotland J
Yard staple. Drop by and check them out.

Jesting juggler dazzles 
Carnival audience
By RYAN DONOVAN
; 'Tartan Staffwriter
1 ' Juggler/ comedian Mark Nizer got off 
to a late start with his entertaining act,
; butpnce he got started, he was smokin. 
? Iiisjuggling was dazzling, at times somedid (except the few who would shout, 
Go home, Juggle Boy!).
The audience was not safe for this 
performance. Nizer threw out a soccer 
ball as a means of picking volunteers. 
Then he used them as stagehands, as 
well as material for future jokes. None
There was hardly a part of his body that 
was not used in one juggling trick or an
other. Yes, that includes his crotch. He 
caught a cigar box there ...
Twhat dangerous, but always entertain
ing. And as a supplement to his act, he 
told some jokes, mostly making fun of 
inimes, his audience assitants.
; -Nizer began with the standard three.balf tricks, and pulled off some of the 
Charcler (at least they looked hard) tricks.
- He'went through an immense collection 
Cof-items that included unicycles, torches, 
an'd machetes. There was hardly a part 
>0*his body that was not used in one 
juggling trick or another. Yes, that in. eludes his crotch. He caught a cigar box 
 there, not right in the middle, but damn 
>filo)3e.
What made Nizer different from any 
shmoe with balls on the street (besides 
being a World Juggling Champion) were 
; the funny little remarks that he shot out 
! every so often. Even when he messed up 
I it was good, because hed end up making 
a crack about the mistake, the audience 
would laugh, planets would align, and 
everything would be better. Of course, 
here was no one there who would have 
blamed him if he missed more than he
of the audience participants minded too 
much, not even the poor little girl who 
got dragged up there.
His finale was the topper to the whole 
show. He brought out a bowling ball, an 
electric knife (cordless, of course), and a 
lit propane torch and juggled them. Im 
sure it would have been a much more 
memorable performance had he severed 
a finger (though slightly less pleasant), 
but I enjoyed the performance nonethe
less.
I do have one small complaint. During 
some of his juggling routines, he played 
this cheesy, 80s synth-rock that you 
would really expect to hear on Star 
Search. I suppose its better than play
ing lounge music, so Im not going to 
whine too much.
All of you people who decided to skip 
this show missed an impressive display 
of juggling. Seating was limited; in fact, 
there were about as many people stand
ing as sitting. Those of you who missed 
it and hate juggling, I hope you enjoyed 
the movie.
Comedian cracks up crowd
By RYAN DONOVAN
Tartan Staffwriter
Last Saturday, in case you missed it, comedian Bob 
Nelson performed in the tent as sort of a close-out to 
Carnival. I saw Nelson perform on his HBO special, 
and tins had some of the same elements, but many 
things were pleasantly new. You may also remember 
Nelson from a fairly bad movie called Brain Donors 
(1992).
He summed up his act best himself. If you cant 
laugh at yourself, who can you laugh at? he said. It 
then followed that ifyou can laugh at yourself, you can 
laugh at other people too. Nelson made fun of  I 
mean satirized just about everyone in existence, 
with himself being one of the prime victims.
Nelsons best bits were undoubtedly his characters. 
These characters were the bulk of the HBO special I 
saw, and they were the funniest parts of his act  
especially his most famous (as famous as any of the 
characters get) character, Eppi Epperman. He puts 
on glasses from his trunk of tricks and he is Eppi.
Thank goodness that in this age of political correct
ness, there are still people who can make fun of 
others and be funny. Its not cruelty; its satire; you 
know, parodying others in order to point out the silly 
traits we all have. Ive bowled before, and hell, I 
thought I was doing something pretty athletic at the 
time. (Those of you who missed the show are probably 
saying, What are you talking about?)
Nelson is another comedian who does a little jug
gling during his act, but it wasnt nearly as impressive 
as Mark Nizers routine on Thursday. The juggling 
wasnt supposed to be impressive  it was just a 
funny act to do. He actually juggled those little 
scarves old ladies wear on their heads.
This is juggling even I could do (uncoordinated dolt 
that I am). But Nelson did it as Eppi Epperman, and 
to a gospel soundtrack, no less. It was a good way to 
end the show.
He had the audience clapping; everyone was into it. 
All in all, it was funny. I laughed. Ha ha. If you 
missed it, shame on you, our activities fee brought in 
some good stuff this Carnival, and you should milk it 
for all its worth.

Comedian Bob Nelson, who has appeared on HBO and in the

Comedy troupe Selected Hilarity gives short but sweet performance
By DAN ROSENBERG
Tartan Staffwriter
Selected Hilarity made their 
fourth appearance at CMU in 
three years over Carnival week
end. The North Carolina-based 
comedy troupe successfully mixed 
improvisation, music, and com
edy sketches into a hilarious (al
beit brief) 35 minute show Satur
day night inside the packed tent.
During their routine, the quar
tet of young men performed songs 
that included a tribute to Spam, 
a sexually explicit visit to 
McDonalds (which included get
ting McFondled by Ronald 
McDonald), a ballad that fea
tured many oxymorons (includ
ing awful good, bittersweet, and 
the emphasized happily married), 
and three excerpts from more
sexually explicit tunes, includ
ing a song about a woman with 
several male acquaintances, a 
ballad that includes the line, 
Thats not my finger, and the 
story of Puff the Magic Dragons 
experiences in his cave.
One of the groups trademarks 
is a parody of Top 40 music 
countdowns, an improvisational 
skit they also performed during 
this years orientation. Using 
phrases given to them by audi
ence members, Selected Hilarity 
counted down the top three songs 
on the chart, which were (in as
cending order): Choke the 
Chicken, Dont Eat Yellow 
Snow, and the world-famous 
country tune, I Was Abducted 
by Aliens.
Sketches that did not feature 
music included an ad for a subpar college featuring a testimo
nial from a fourth-year sopho
more, a tale of people to avoid 
(which included a drunk, ag
gressive woman; a rambling 
grandparent; an extremely rude 
roommate; and a hyperactive 
boss). The troupe also per
formed a few very brief skits 
that included an incompetent 
witness and a young man who

ART AND THEATER
Study abroad art show describes foreign travels
By WILLIAM WOOD
Tartan Staffwriter
Studying abroad has its merits, to be 
sure. A rich experience with a new cul
tural environment can put ones own cul
ture into greater perspective allowing for 
personal and academic growth. This, I 
think, is particularly the case for artists. 
The way art is perceived in this country 
its role, function, practice, and interpre
tation is, as one might imagine, radically 
different from the ways other cultures 
think about art. Though we might share 
a canon with some other cultures, even 
the same works, movements, and artists 
are understood in an entirely different 
light. The same is true for designers, 
seeing how other cultures interact with 
designed objects, and how other design
ers approach the tasks laid before them 
can shed new light on difficult problems.
The architecture that has served as the 
model for so much of our own has its roots, 
obviously, somewhere else. We are a young 
country with little tradition of our own. 
For an architect, searching out those roots
can provide a much deeper appreciation 
and insight into the creative process of 
building.
There is, however, one severe draw
back to practicing art in another country: 
how does one get it back home? Large 
canvases do not fit easily into luggage, nor 
are they cheaply shipped overseas. Sculp
tures present an even greater challenge 
to the bank account. This is perhaps why 
the Study Abrpad show, now on display at 
the alumni House is composed almost 
entirely of photographs.
Certainly there is something to the 
composition of these photos that makes 
them different from mom and dads pho
tos of their trip to Venicemom and dad 
are not in them, for one  but still there 
is this sense that the works on display are 
mostly momentos. There are some dra
matic photos of sites, dramatic for the 
sites being photographed, but I think that 
they provide more inspiration as source 
material than as actual art. I have, after 
all, seen plenty of photos of Venice, Rome, 
Greece and so forth, in art history books. 
The fact that many of the students are
architects and design stu
dents is best reflected by 
this. For an architect, to 
see the structures that 
they have studied but 
only seen in photos can 
be a very revealing expe
rience, one well worth 
documenting with ones 
own photograph of the 
moment.
StevenShaw, one ofthe 
art students in the show, 
is profoundly lucky in 
that his interests, as rep
resented in this show, are 
in video form. It is easy 
enough to bring a couple 
of video tapes home. A 
few other students filled 
sketchbooks with render
ings of the memorable 
things that they saw; 
again, bringing things 
home presents limita
tions on what one can do 
while they are away.

The overall success of Chess 
is due in part to its cast, but is 
also the result of the tireless 
efforts of its talented crew and

staged many impressive dance

so much enthusiasm and ap
peared to be having so much fun 
that I, too, found myself having 
fun simply by watchingthe show.
Unfortunately, the same can>not be said for Scotch n Sodas 
1996 Carnival show, Chess. Al
though the play was well-done 
and quite enjoyable, the actors 
(many of whom also appeared in 
Hair) seemed to lack the enthu
siasm they possessed before (perhaps because the hippies of Hair 
! are naturally more enthusiastic 
than the players in a tragic ro
mance such as Chess).
; But enough griping. Chess may 
not have been perfect, but it was 
still a very entertaining show. 
The plot is thin (the assistant to 
;an American chess legend falls 
!for a Russian chess player at the 
national tournament) and a little 
too long (the show ran over three 
hours), but the cast is so damn 
talented that it really didnt mat
ter. Watching them perform for 
a few hours was a pleasure.
