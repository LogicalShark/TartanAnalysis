HUB provides on
line assistance
 Carnegie Mellon University 1997 
Grades are now accessible electronically from the new HUB Web site.
By ANNE RAY
Tartan Assistant Features Editor
The HUB Web site officially 
came on-line on September 18 to 
provide students with updated 
personal information more effi
ciently. In its initial state, stu
dent enrollment information was 
only available on the web to firstyear students in SCS, MCS, and 
H&SS. However, the website has 
now expanded to allow all stu
dents, including graduate stu
dents, to access their CMU 
records over the World Wide Web.
According to John Papinchak, 
the co-director of Enrollment Ser
vices, the Web site was piloted 
with only a limited number of 
freshmen because they have been 
at CMU for a shorter period of 
time and they have fewr records 
with not as much background.
Students can access their aca
demic records, schedules for any 
semester, grades, financial ac
counts, enrollment data, and cur
rent address data at http: 11 
www.cmu.edu/hub. Theinformation is kept confidential by hav
ing students enter their andrew 
password and userid. There is 
also a section where students can 
provide feedback regarding the 
Web site.
We thought that if we could 
teach the freshmen, the upper
classmen would be a cinch, said 
Papinchak. [The Web site] has 
provided students with access to 
information. Where its made it 
advantageous for the students is, 
for example, they can go to clus
ter for schedule printouts, so 
theres less foot-traffic over here, 
and we can spend more time with 
other issues, like financial issues.
This Spring compared to last 
 Spring ... its been better, said 
Papinchak. This year at the Ex
press Office window, for example, 
theres just no one there. Its been 
very quiet [during enrollment 
week], especially on Tuesday, 
Wednesday, and Thursday. At the 
best, we took students right away, 
and at the worst, they only waited 
about half an hour.

According to Murphy, the

current building costs, a new 
 residence hall would cost as 
much as $40,000 per stu

will supposedly house less than 300 stu
dents. The cost of the new building, an 
estimated several million dollars, will 
be paid for in part by the housing system

The Department of Defense 
(DoD) officially closed the inves
tigation into Carnegie Mellons 
government-funded research con
tracts, subcontracts, and grants 
this past Tuesday. The investi
gation began on October 12,1993. 
At this time, DoD agents did not 
provide reasons for the inquiry 
and failed to indicate any specific 
areas or projects under scrutiny.
Upon the close of this case, all 
possible criminal and civil aspects 
of the case were dropped.
According to an interoffice 
memo by Mehrabian, no settle
ment or payment was necessary 
to close the case.
All documents related to De
fense Department contracts were 
requested by the DoD through a 
subpoena delivered to President 
Robert Mehrabian in 1993. In 
complying with this tedious re
quest, millions of pages were com
piled for the 140 contracts and 
grants in question, according to 
Provost Paul Christiano in the 
October 25, 1993 issue of The 
Tartan. In an October 19 memo
randum, the University notified
researchers and ----------------
managers dealing 
with DoD projects 
to keep all pertinent 
documentation.
They began turning 
over documents to 
the DoD on Novem
ber 12, 1993. Ac
cording to Don ___________
Hale, vice-presi- WHHBOi 
dent of University Relations, 
members ofBusiness Affairs were 
involved in aiding the investiga
tion by obtaining and packaging 
the massive amounts of paper
work requested. The university, 
in fiscal year 1992-93, conducted 
a great deal of research funded by 
the Defense Department. Of the
$ 146.7 million total spent on Uni
versity research, approximately 
$64.5 million was contributed by 
the DoD according to a 1993 pub
lic statement. Mehrabian stated 
at the time that he hoped to clearly 
define the focus of the investiga"We have always firmly believed in 
the integrity of Carnegie Mellons

tion. However, no further infor
mation was available upon the 
closing of the case as to what 
initiated the investigation. We 
dont have any of the details, 
said Hale. Christiano, in the 
public statement commented 
that the investigation was un
der consideration for criminal
and civil charges.
Mehrabian said, We are ex
tremely pleased that the Jus
tice Department investigation 
has been concluded. Through
out the three years of this in
quiry, the University has coop---------------------- erated fully
with the in
vestigators, 
committing 
the resources 
necessary to 
provide all of 
the documen
tation they re
quested. We 
 have always 
firmly believed in the integrity 
of Carnegie Mellons research 
enterprise.
Mehrabian is still working 
with the government to resolve 
any issues regarding still-open 
federal audits and to finalize 
permanent research overhead 
rates.
Hunt begins first
floor renovations
By SHEILA FLANAGAN
Tartan Staffwriter
Construction on the first 
floor of Hunt Library, which 
involves the relocation of 
the circulation desk to the 
former reading area, began 
in mid-December.The ex
pected time of completion is 
the end of January or early 
February. Not only will the 
relocation benefit students, 
but it will also serve as the 
first of a series of renova
tions which the Hunt Li
brary administration hopes 
will benefit the entire CMU 
community.
Once the circulation desk 
has moved, the books that 
are on reserve, for classes 
will be on closed reserve 
instead of on open shelves. 
This change simply means 
that only the library staff 
will be able to access the 
books on reserve and also 
that they will keep track of 
each student who checks out 
a reserved book.
This system will allow the 
staff to know the location of 
a particular book. Accord
ing to Henry Pisciotta, head
of Fine Arts & Special Col
lections and chair of the 
space planning committee in 
the CMU Libraries, the de
cision to switch to closed re
serves was based on student 
opinion.
Several years ago, CMU 
had several committees on 
Undergraduate Education 
which included student rep
resentation and one of the 
last ones focused on the li
braries.
One of their recommenda
tions was that we switch to 
closed reserves, said 
Pisciotta.
This system, according to 
Pisciotta, will better control 
the problem of students who 
do not return reserved books 
promptly by keeping tabs on 
them and allowing other stu
dents who want to check out 
the books to queue up on the 
computer.
There is a small amount of 
inconvenience that will per
sist until this project is com
pleted despite the fact that 
this construction is taking 
place to benefit the CMU 
community. Nevertheless,

Switzerland bank junks Naziera records, violates policy
ZURICH, Switzerland Jan. 13 (AP)
 Switzerlands biggest bank admit1 ted Tuesday to throwing away archive 
material in violation of a government 
ban on the destruction of records that 
might reveal details about financial 
transactions during the Nazi era.
Union Bank of Switzerland said one 
of its employees last week threw away 
documents, apparently thinking they 
, were unimportant. Some of the docu
ments dated back to the 19th century.
Zurich district attorney Peter 
Cosandey described the documents as 
' politically sensitive material, and 
' said authorities were carrying out de tailed investigations into the contents.
He said it was too early to say 
whether criminal proceedings would 
be launched against the bank em
ployee.
The documents were dumped in two 
containers to be shredded, when they 
f were spotted by an employee of a pri; vate security firm guarding the bank. 
He handed them over to Jewish com
munity representatives in Zurich who 
then alerted police.
If God puts these documents in my 
hands, then I have to do something, 
said the security employee, Christoph 
Meili. Meili, who has been suspended 
from his job, said he rescued only part 
ofthe documents. Therestwere destroyed
At a press conference, the IsraeliHebrew Community of Zurich said the 
documents concerned details of loans 
from 1920 to 1926, including loans to
 German firms, and property dealings 
'from 1930 to 1970.
There was no immediate detail on 
whether they related directly to the 
Holocaust.
The government banned destruction 
of archive material last month as part 
of investigations into allegations that 
Switzerland colluded with Hitlers Ger
many, siphoned off Jewish assets, and
UBS also has its own internal ban on 
destruction of old material.
Jewish groups claim Swiss banks 
still hold up to $7 billion in assets and 
interest belonging to Jews who per
ished in the Holocaust. Swiss banks 
have said the actual amount could be 
no more than a tiny fraction of that.
Tuesdays revelation is certain to 
embarrass the Swiss banks and gov
ernment. The government already has 
been facing outrage over remarks by 
former President Jean-Pascal 
Delamuraz, who called demands by 
Jewish groups to establish a multimillion dollar compensation fund for Ho
locaust victims blackmail.
The seven-member Swiss cabinet 
has stood by Delamuraz, who remains 
economics minister, but has indicated 
it is softening on the compensationissue.
Christoph Graf, director of the Swiss 
Federal Archives, said a compensa
tion fund could be created immedi
ately because there is historical evi
dence that the the Swiss economy 
profited from the Third Reich. Graf 
spoke to reporters visiting the ar
chives, which are being opened to re
searchers.
Swiss government officials estimate 
thatitwilltake 50people workingfor one 
year to go through the hordes of docu
ments.
The government lifted the countrys 
strict banking secrecy laws late last 
year to allow a full inquiry.
A senior government official, Tho
mas Borer, said he assured the Polish 
government Monday that he would 
provide it with a list of names of 
Polish citizens whose unclaimed bank 
assets were handed over to Poland after 
World WarE.
Borer said it would take up to two 
weeks to put together the list. A simi
lar arrangement will be made with 
Hungary, he said.

JERUSALEM, Jan. 17 (AP)Hours 
' after Israeli troops withdrew from most 
of Hebron, Israeli and Palestinian ne
gotiators Friday signed the agreement 
on the pullback and a future Israeli 
. troop redeployment in the West Bank.
The accord had been initialed Tues
day by chief negotiators Dan Shomron 
for Israel and Saeb Erakat for the 
Palestinians. The two signed it Friday 
at a Jerusalem hotel.
~ The agreement was submitted 
Wednesday to the Israeli and Pales'tinian cabinets for approval. Israels 
'parliament also ratified the agreement Thursday, by a vote of 87-17, 
with one abstention, paving the way 
for a full signature.
Israeli troops left 80 percent of 
Hebron at dawn Friday, redeploying 
in the downtown area where 500 Jew
ish settlers live.
The agreement says that within two 
months of the signing, talks will begin 
on a permanent peace agreement. It 
also stipulates that in the first week of 
March, Israel much begin its threestage withdrawal from West Bank ru
ral areas. The pullback is to be con
cluded by mid-1998.
Cosbys son shot to death
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 16 (AP)  Bill 
Cosbys only son was shot to death early 
Thursday in a possible robbery attempt 
while changing a flat tire along a freeway.
The body of Ennis William Cosby, 27, 
was found about 1:45 am in a pool of 
blood next to the car.
No immediate arrests were made.
KCBS-TV reported that Cosby was on 
his way to see a woman friend when he 
called her by cellular phone at 1:15 am to 
say he had a flat and ask her to come 
help illuminate the area.
She arrived shortly after the shooting, 
calling police at 1:28 am, the station 
said. KCBS did not disclose the womans 
name, saying only that she lived in 
Los Angeles and was in the entertain
ment industry.
The woman saw at least a portion of 
this and we are interviewing her. It is 
her description that we have a male 
white suspect, Police Commader Tim 
McBride said.
The younger Cosbys Mercedes con
vertible was found in a well-to-do area 
near the crest ofthe Santa Monica Moun
tains not far from the exclusive Bel-Air 
section of Los Angeles.
McBride said, It is unknown whether 
he was followed at this time or not. I 
think thats a good probability. But it 
may have been a chance opportunity 
that somebody took, robbery being a 
possible motive.
However, nothing apparently was 
taken, he said.
Explosions rock abortion clinic
ATLANTA, Jan. 16 (AP)  Two bomb 
blasts an hour apart rocked a building 
containing an abortion clinic on Thurs
day, injuring six people, all in the 
second blast.
The explosions shattered windows 
across the street and terrified bystand
ers, just as abortion rights advocates were 
announcing in Washington that anti-abortion violence had declined slightly.
President Clinton condemned the ex
plosions as a vile and malevolent act of 
terrorism.
Make no mistake: Anyone who brings 
violence against a woman trying to exer
cise her constitutional rights is commit
ting an act of terror, Clinton said.
The first explosion was reported at 
9:30 am at the Atlanta Northside Fam
ily Planning Services, located on the 
ground floor of a five-story building 
that houses offices of lawyers, den
tists, and other professionals. No inju
ries were reported.
An hour later, an explosion erupted 
from a trash container outside the build
ing, injuring six people.
ABureau of Alcohol, Tobacco andFirearms agent investigating the first explo
sion had to be helped from the building 
and was taken to a hospital for observa
tion. Two other people were treated and 
released, while three more were hospi
talized for observation.
A half hour after the second explosion, 
the Piedmont Clinic, an abortion center 
about a half-mile from the Atlanta 
Northside clinic, was evacuated after 
receiving a bomb threat. Police officers 
have been sent to other abortion clinics 
around the city as a precaution; the 
clinics said they would remain open.
Democrat quits ethics panel
WASHINGTON, Jan. 14 (AP)  The 
House ethics committees ranking Demo
crat said Tuesday he would remove him
self from the investigation of Newt 
Gingrich, bowing to pressure that built 
quickly over his handling of a taped 
phone call involving the speaker.
As partisan conflict escalated to a fe
ver pitch, Rep. JimMcDermott, D-Wash., 
said that as a matter of conscience he 
was stepping aside to call attention to 
Republican subversion of an indepen
dent, fair ethics process.
He conditioned his recusal on Repub
licans maintaining political balance on 
the evenly divided committee. The GOP 
could do so by removing one of their 
members  presumably newly ap
pointed Lamar Smith of Texas  leav
ing the panel with four lawmakers from 
each party.
Not to be outdone by McDermott, 
Republicans accused him of violating 
federal law by accepting a recording of 
a telephone call, in which Gingrich 
plotted his responses to his admitted 
ethical wrongdoing.
FBI Director Louis Freeh said an in
vestigation would begin immediately 
into the taping by a Florida couple and 
the subsequent dissemination of the 
contents. McDermott did not address 
whether he leaked the tape to The New 
York Times, although the newspaper 
said it was obtained from an unidenti
fied Democratic congressman.
McDermott tarred ethics committee 
Chairwoman Nancy Johnson with accu
sations of violating the House rules shes 
supposed to enforce. He said she refused 
to consider evidence on the tape that 
showed Gingrich breached his com
mitment not to orchestrate reactions 
to the violations.
He bitterly attacked her stewardship 
of the committee, saying, Complaints. 
lodged against members ofthe minority 
have been used as barter in negotiations 
over sanctions for Gingrich.
McDermotts comments were in a writ
ten statement and a letter to Mrs. 
Johnson. The chairwoman responded 
just as harshly, lashing back in a writ
ten statement of her own.
I will not allow angry partisanship to 
divert the committee from its job of pro
viding the public and the Congress with
complete information in the Gingrich 
case, she said.
Gingrich admitted Dec. 21 that he 
violated House rules. The speaker ac
knowledged he should have sought spe
cific legal advice about using nonprofit 
organizations to accomplish political 
goals and admitted that under his name 
information was submitted to the com
mittee that falsely denied his political 
committees involvement in a college 
course he taught.
Lawsuit filed against AOL
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 15 (AP) - 
America Online cannot handle the in
creased load that has resulted from its 
new price plan for Internet service, a 
lawsuit contends.
The class-action suit, filed in Superior 
Court, said AOL subscribers have en
countered busy and unavailable phone 
lines and/or inaccessible computer equip
ment since the company began offering 
unlimited access for a $19.95 a month 
fee at the beginning of the year.
Attorney Louis Marlin said Tuesday 
his clients were unhappy with AOL be
cause it has become increasingly diffi
cult to obtain dial-in access.
They try over and over and over again 
to try and get in and they get a constant 
busy signal. One client tried 26 times ! 
the other night, he contended.
The plaintiffs, claiming negligence and | 
consumer fraud, are seeking at least $20 
million in compensatory damages as well 
as punitive damages and attorney fees.
Marlin said that figure is only a mini
mum estimate to give warning to the 
other side that we are seeking signifi
cant monetary damages.
The suit also asks for a court order 
stopping AOL from selling any more 
flat-fee, unlimited-access service until 
there is sufficient equipment to handle 
the increased amount of users.
Every new subscriber they get 
makes it more difficult for the existing 
subscriber to connect to the service, 
Marlin said.
We expect to prevail in the classaction suits addressing member ac
cess to AOL, the company said in a 
statement.
Although we understand the frustra
tion some members are experiencing at 
not being able to obtain immediate local 
access during peak periods, the aver
age AOL member gets more value un
der unlimited pricing than ever be
fore.
It added that the company plans to 
expand the systems capacity through a 
$250 million addition in equipment and 
services over the next two months.
In December, AOL spokesman Steve 
Sigmund said users were staying online 
20 percent longer since the unlimited 
access went into effect, averaging three 
million hours a day  up from 1.6 mil
lion hours a couple months before.

50 YEARS AGO, Jan. 17,1947: 
Pi Tau Sigma, the honorary me
chanical engineering fraternity, 
broke a 23 year-old all-male tra
dition by initiaing Mary Lou 
Mooney. Mooney, the first woman 
to enter the fraternity, was in
ducted with 20 other pledges at a 
ceremony in the Carnegie Union.
Additionally, Carnegie Tech 
Admissions Chairman John M. 
Daniels was honored at the Theta 
Tau national conference. The 
executive council of the frater
nity decided to name its 16th bi
ennial convention, held in Louis
ville, after Daniels. Daniels had 
served on Theta Taus executive 
council since 1931.
25 YEARS AGO, Jan. 20,1972: 
Vice President for Academic Af
fairs Edward R. Schatz was 
named acting acting president of 
CMU to replace H. Guyford 
Stever. Stever stepped down as 
president on Feb. 1,1972, to serve 
as the president of the National 
Science Foundation.
Schatz had been at CMU assa 
student, faculty member, and 
administrator since 1939. He re
ceived B.S., M.S., and doctoral
degrees from the university and 
served as instructor, assistant 
professor, and associate profes
sor. CMU named him a professor 
of electrical engineering in 1961.
Additionally, Schatz held other 
administrative posts with the 
university. He served as assis
tant head of the department of 
electrical engineering from 1953 
to 1957. From 1957 until 1960 he 
served as Assistant Dean of the 
College of Engineering and Sci
ence, was the Associate Dean in
1960-61, Dean of Research from
1961-64, and was named Vice 
President for Academic Affairs 
by then-president J. C. Warner.
TEN YEARS AGO, Jan. 20, 
1987: CMU fraternities let out a 
resounding complaint against 
Carnegie Mellon Housing, alleg
ing that the Housing department 
was negligent in its care of the 
fraternity houses.
Glenn Schuster, the house man
ager of Theta Xi, cited problems 
with keys, heating, plumbing, and 
rebuilding of the outside wall as 
examples of the houses disre
pair. He also noted that Housing 
had deducted $433 from the Theta
Xi account for a window replace
ment and $95 for a case of 
lightbulbs, but that the window 
had not been replaced and the 
lightbulbs had not been received.
House managers from Delta 
Upsilon, Pi Kappa Alpha, and 
Phi Kappa Theta also claimed to 
have problems with housing, cit
ing difficulties with dishwashers, 
wiring, and cockroaches.
Housing countered that these 
problems would have been fixed, 
but that there was a lack of com
munication between the frater
nities and the department. Di
rector of Housing Tony Martin, 
someone has to make me aware 
of these things before I can help 
them out.
FIVE YEARS AGO, Jan. 20, 
1992: CMU students arrivedback 
on campus to a surprise, courtesy 
of Dining Services.
Over winter break Dining Ser
vices made sweeping changes in 
its food service, from providing 
stir-it-yourself woks at the High
lander Cafe to more behind-thescenes modifications of meal se
lection.
The changes stemmed from sev
eral student polls taken before 
the break, most of which indi
cated a desire for change from the 
student body.
ONE YEAR AGO, Jan. 15, 
1996: Several dozen protesters 
stood outside of CFA in a protest 
againt CMUs refusal to recog
nize Martin Luther King Day by 
cancelling classes and the Soft
ware Engineering Institutes in
volvement in military technologi
cal advancement.
Vincent Scotti Eirene headed 
the protest, originally scheduled 
to be held inside of CFA. How
ever, Security Chief James 
LaPaglia asked the protestors to 
move outside, as the protest in
terfered with CFAs career op
portunities events that were tak
ing place the same day.
Eirene, a leader for the Pitts
burgh Demiliarized Zone (DMZ), 
was arrested two years earlier 
for blocking the entrance to the 
SEI. LaPaglia said that he had 
arrested Eirene at least a half 
dozen times.

STUDIO receives grant
On December 19, Carnegie Mellons STUDIO for Creative 
Inquiry received a $65,000 grant from the Howard Heinz 
Endowment to conduct research and share ideas with the 
public regarding use of open spaces within Pittsburghs Nine 
Mile Run site, a former slag dumping site.
For the project, the STUDIOs artist have assembled engi
neers, scientists, planners, historians and other academics 
and professional whose expertise focuses on the interaction 
of the natural environments and urban communities.
The team plans on focusing on the sites aesthetic and 
cultural potential.
The team also hopes to create a model for other brownfield 
sites  post-industrial areas slated for potential develop
ment  and to promote environmental renewal of the Pitts
burgh area.
The STUDIO will use the grant funding to conduct work
shops, create a Web site, publish a report and start a public 
dialogue about Nine Mile Run, all as part of the first phase of 
the STUDIOs three-phase plan for the project. During the 
second phase, the STUDIOs artists will further explore the 
five areas covered in the workshops and develop an approach 
to the open spaces surrounding the new housing develop
ment.
In the third phase, the STUDIOs artists will present their 
recommendations to academics, city planning administra
tors, and the general public via on-site presentations and 
displays.
The STUDIO for Creative Inquiry is an interdisciplinary 
center in Carnegie Mellons College of Fine Arts. Founded in 
1989, it serves as a focus for experimental activities in the 
arts at Carnegie Mellon.
New research center for the arts (CMAT) opens at CMU
In response to the growing need for information technology 
expertise in the arts industry, Carnegie Mellon has created a 
research, training, and service center to investigate new tech-1 
nologies, stimulate ideas about the application of these technolo
gies to the arts, and provide opportunities for arts managers to 
test these technologies.
The Carnegie Mellon Center for Arts Management and Tech
nology (CMAT), a collaborative venture of the universitys Mas
ter of Arts Management program and four other organizations, is 
the first policy research center of its kind in the country.
CMATs mission includes working with researchers and prac
titioners interested in information technology and exploring its 
viability in the management of professional arts organizations;
CMAT will also investigate the policy implications of emerging 
technology and test emerging technologies for their applicability 
to arts organizations.
The Center will provide opportunities for arts managers to test 
the technology in their own organizations and disseminate infor
mation about the new technology to the arts community via 
training and on-line demonstrations.

Officials plan new campus housing
Carnegie Mellon in Brief
Jason Siegendorf/ Tartan Photo Staff Manager 
Construction at Hunt Library has made various parts of the first 
floor inaccessible to students.
HUNT, from page 1
the library staff is making a 
great effort to accommodate 
faculty and students. In ad
dition to the quiet study ar
eas which already exist on 
the third floor of the library, 
the library staff has desig
nated certain areas on the 
fourth floor for quiet study.
The group study area in 
the basement has been ex
panded with more tables. 
The furniture which was for
merly in the small reading 
area on the first floor has 
also been moved to the base
ment, along with newspapers 
and certain periodicals. Ac
cording to Ignatios 
Alexander, head of Adminis
trative Services in the Uni
versity Libraries, there is 
also a portion of the first floor 
which is still accessible.
The entire corner is not 
blocked off. Many people do 
not realize that you can still 
sit back there and that you 
just need to go around the 
[present] circulation desk, 
said Alexander. Moreover, 
when the relocation of the 
circulation desk is com
pleted, seating on the first 
floor will not be limited.
Pisciotta said that the 
area with the large tables,
carrels, and chairs will still 
exist and that a proposal 
for new furnishings will 
also be made.
While the relocation of the 
circulation desk will be a 
major visual change in Hunt 
Library, it is only the begin
ning of a series of renova
tions which are being 
planned for the first floor of 
the library. The preliminary 
drawing gives an overview 
of the plans for these reno
vations.
For example, the space 
planning committee, accord
ing to Pisciotta, has tenta
tively proposed the reloca
tion of the reference desk 
to the space which is pres
ently occupied by the circu
lation desk.
In addition, the commit
tee plans to propose the ad
dition of a cluster/classroom 
dedicated to information re
sources, a readers lounge 
with newspapers and peri
odicals, and several group 
study rooms.
However, these plans 
along with the plans for the 
possibility of a new Engi
neering and Science Library 
are still sketchy and will be 
discussed in more detail at 
a later date.
Alumni, Westinghouse fund science scholarship

and consequently out of student 
and conference fees.
Since housing is indepen
dently financed, it receives no 
subsidity or support from 
within the university other 
than the housing charges.
A company has not yet been 
contracted for its building, al
though the dormitory is ex
pected to open in the fall of 
1999. Several companies are 
currently under consideration.
If built, the dormitory will 
have several impacts on stu
dents when opened, according 
to Murphy. All students in uni
versity housing would help 
share the cost of the new dor
mitory through increased hous
ing costs.
Donner Hall and several 
other dorms which are wellsuited for freshmen would have 
a greater freshman population. 
Apartment and suite style ar
rangements, which are in high 
demand among upperclassmen 
and non-freshmen first-year 
students in university housing 
will be easier to obtain.
CMU alumni George Pake, along with Westinghouse, has provided the 
motivation to raise funds for a scholarship for science students.
gy GIL ALTEROVTTZ
fartan Senior ,Staffwriter
Between 1938 and 1968, over 200 entering freshmen at Carnegie 
Mellon (then known as Carnegie Tech) were selected as George 
Westinghouse Scholars, a prestigious pro
gram that offered free tuition and a stipend 
funded by Westinghouse as well as opportu
nities, get work experience at the company.
According to a pamphlet published by 
Westinghouse, tuition, room, board, and 
fees amounted to between $775 to $3200 
(late 1930s to late 1960s) or approximately 
$8,600 to $14,500 per year in 1996 dollars.
Now, a couple of alumni that benefited from 
this scholarship are spearheading an ef
fort to reincarnate the financial portion of 
the scholarship.
According to George Pake, one of the two 
former recipients leading the efforts to start 
the new fund said, My friend Dr. Ivan 
Sutherland (Engineering 59) suggested the 
idea of the new scholarship, and I whole
heartedly agreed. Sutherland says he has 
been mulling [the idea] over for 10 years or 
so [and approached the] Carnegie people 
four to five years ago.
Pake, who obtained three degrees from 
CMU, later became founding director of 
Xeroxs Palo Alto Research Center. Ivan 
Sutherland, the other alumnus leading the 
effort, is the vice president of and Sun fellow 
at Sun Microsystems. His doctoral thesis 
resulted in the first modern computer
graphics system.
Together, Sutherland and Pake have given over 10 percent of the 
total goal of $500,000 to endow the scholarship. Through the estab
lishment of an endowment for the Westinghouse Scholars Scholar
ship, one student enrolling in engineering or science will be awarded
full tuition for four 
years. The new schol
arship will be given 
to one student every 
four years and will be 
based solely on merit.
Pake said, I think 
an attractive feature 
[of endowing the 
scholarship] is to 
think of making it 
possible for some 
other young people 
coming along to have 
the same kind of op
portunity that I had. 
He added, My 
Westinghouse Schol
arship made it pos
sible for me to attend 
Carnegie ... In a very 
real sense, the schol
arship made my pro
fessional life pos
sible.
Sutherland recalls 
an incident that reit
erates the same mes
sage of giving back:
I went on a trip to Europe and a dear family friend handed me $100 
before I left and said this will help with your travel expenses and I 
said Can I pay you back? He said dont pay me back, pass it on to 
someone else.
If you were helped when you were a young person, and later in life, 
you remember that... help some other young person.
Sutherland also stressed the fact that such a scholarship is a 
prospective award (given for future potential) rather than a retro
spective one (given for past achievement). He said, It seems to me 
that the prospective awards have a great deal more value to society. 
If you can identify promising young people, and help them with their 
college careers ... then they contribute back to society over the rest 
of their lives.
Other recipients of the original scholarship from 1938- 1968 are 
being contacted in order to obtain contributions to reach the goal. In 
a press release, Pake said that he believes that the former scholars 
have reached a stage in our lives when we should be returning to 
society its gifts to us. Each of us was once declared among the best 
and brightest when Carnegie Tech selected us for generous support. 
Can we be generous in return and give the next generation a boost 
like the one we got?
While there are over 300 endowed scholarships, Kimberly 
Mauersberg (Assistant director of Public Relations for Develop
ment) noted that this one was special in that it allows previous 
recipients of the scholarship to help set up a new one.
In addition, according to a CMU press release, Westinghouse has 
provided a grant of $150,000 to Carnegie Mellon University to 
provide financial aid for undergraduate minorities and women in 
engineering and to stimulate gifts from Carnegie Mellon alumni who 
were George Westinghouse Scholars.
Regarding the return of the scholarship to CMU, Susan Stitt, 
Director of Development for the Western States and a CMU alum4 
nus, noted: Its nice to have the Westinghouse scholarship back -4 
the tradition. !

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  20 January 19975
Math professor passes away
Campus community mourns loss of teacher
By JOHN BIGGS
Tartan Contributing Editor
Professor Roger N. Pederson, professor of math
ematical sciences, passed away on December 8,
1996, at age 65, leaving 44 years of strong re
search. The cause of death is unknown.
Earning a bachelors degree in 1952 and a 
doctorate in 1957 from the University of Minne
sota, Dr. Pederson taught at the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology from 1958 to 1960. He 
entered the CMU community in 1960 as an 
assistant professor, and became a professor in 
1970. He taught classes on boundary value, 
linear programing, and partial differential equa
tions.
He was a great guy, interesting to talk to, and 
fun to be with, said Scott Crosby, a freshman 
CS major.
Crosby was in a class taught by Dr. Pederson 
last semester: Matrix Algebra. [There were] 
only two people in the class for most of it. A new 
section of Matrix algebra was opened at the 
same time as his section. Everyone moved over 
to the new section ... except me, and one other 
student. Thus, most days. I enjoyed a 1:1 student-faculty ratio. That let me talk to the profes
sor and learn a lot about him. He was a really 
great guy. I usually talked to him at least 1/2 
hour a day about other stuff [outside of the 
class].
Dr. Pedersons love of math was his greatest 
passion. [It was] a very big part of his life, said 
his son, Mark Pederson, a condensed matter 
physicist in Washington, DC. And his interest 
in math carried over into his other hobbies.
Dr. Pederson was an avid bicyclist, pianist, 
and chess strategist. He began cycling to work 
during the oil shortages of the Carter adminis
tration and kept at this hobby until two years 
before his death.
Most of his personal life revolved around his 
various interests. He was a great dad, a very 
dedicated father to his children, said daugh
ter Deborah Pederson, He always had a per
petual interest in math. I remember lectures 
on the mathematics of music and optimal gear 
ratios. One of his main projects was research 
on the tempering of keyboard scales and its 
relation to Western Musics 12-note (chromatic) 
scale. He was also an avid outdoor enthusiast.
Another striking aspect of Dr. Pedersons 
personality was his intense focus and persis
tence in his field. In the 1970s, Dr. Pederson 
worked portions of the Beiberbach Conjecture, 
a 1916 paper.dealing with coefficients of power 
series and inequalities in a class of math
ematical inequalities.
He worked out the fifth coefficient of the 
Conjecture during his work, which was a break
through, said Dr. Pedersons daughter, The 
problem has been completed by a researcher 
at Purdue, but it was done on a computer. It 
sort of shows you the kind of analytic mind my 
father had.
Some people would say that he was an 
enigma even to his death. He was a private 
person, but he wasnt lonely. He was very 
accepting of other people and lived pretty in
tensely, said his daughter, a bond portfolio 
manager for American Express, Near the end 
he was very excited about his two grandkids. 
When my brother and I were younger, we lived 
in Pittsburgh, and the big thing was to go the 
Carnegie Museum to see the dinosaurs. About a 
week before he died, my husband, children, and I 
came up to visit him, and he was so excited to take 
us all to see the dinosaurs again. He was a very 
focused and loving father and grandfather.
Dr. Pedersonwas buried in Minneapolis, where 
his daughter, mother, brother and grandchil
dren live.
Officials capture local fugitives
PITTSBURGH, Jan. 17 (AP) 
Despite spending months to plan 
an escape, many inmates are 
ready to surrender when the cold 
reality of freedom hits them.
Weve had them walk back in 
and knock on the doors and gates, 
said* Gerald Wilson, the warden 
at the Centre County jail and 
former deputy superintendent at 
the state prison in Rockview.
Its pretty unusual for them to 
stay out for long, he said.
Six inmates dug a 70-foot tun
nel under a wall at the State 
Correctional Institution at Pitts
burgh and created a diversion to 
escape last week. Since then, 
two of the men have been 
nabbed in chance encounters 
with authorities.
Thomas Berkelbaugh, 48, 
turned himself in Tuesday after 
he was found babbling in a Hous
ton bus station. He was arraigned 
Thursday night in Pittsburgh 
on charges of escape and crimi
nal conspiracy, after returning 
from Texas in the custody of 
Pennsylvania state troopers, 
state police said.
Wilson and other experts say 
most inmates are fairly dimwitted 
social misfits who inevitably slip 
up when they find themselves 
with no money or shelter outside 
prison walls.
Very often theyre caught 
within one to three days, said 
Edith Flynn, professor of crimi
nal justice at Northeastern Uni
versity in Boston. Criminals 
wind up in prison because they 
havent been exactly Einsteins in 
their lives.
A nationwide manhunt had 
nothing to do with the capture of 
a second escapee from Pittsburgh, 
convicted killer Carmen Keller. 
He and another man, believed to 
be fellow escapee Nuno Pontes, 
were targeted for a traffic stop by 
a rookie Texas trooper because 
they were not wearing seat belts.
The men led police on a brief 
chase along Interstate 10 east of 
Houston and crashed their 1994 
Lincoln on Wednesday evening. 
Pontes ran off into the woods, but 
police said Thursday night they 
had spotted him at least twice 
and had him surrounded in a 
swamp.
Keller told WTAE-TV after a 
hearing Thursday that the six 
inmates split up in Missouri or 
Illinois a day or two after the 
escape. He said they had planned 
the escape for four months. Keller 
declined to say where the three 
at-large escapees might be.
Fugitives often find themselves 
without money and with nowhere 
to turn, Wilson said. They know 
police will be watching friends 
and family, and they cannot ap
ply for jobs without assumed iden
tities, he said. They risk language 
barriers and run-ins with border 
guards if they head for Mexico.
Its such a highly stressful sta
tus when you know people are 
looking for you, so you do things 
to get caught, Wilson said. It 
sounds really stupid to the aver
age person.
Berkelbaugh, Keller, Pontes 
and three others shimmied 
through the tunnel from a prison 
boiler room under a 10-foot-deep
wall into an outside warehouse 
on January 8. They used a power 
drill, power hand saw, hydraulic 
jack and a guards stolen radio.
Police believe they stole a car 
just outside the maximum-security prison and were gone at least 
three hours before they were 
missed in a mid-morning head 
count.
Despite many such well-executed escape plans, Flynn said 
convicts often fail to plan beyond 
the escape, or they commit more 
crimes, such as robberies or car 
thefts, to help them along.
Wilson noted that 70 percent of 
Pennsylvania inmates never have 
been married.
Theyre inadequate at inter
acting with people, he said.
When freedom begins to lose its 
luster, it may be smart to give up, 
Flynn said.
They are aware that probably 
the system is not going to clamp 
down as hard if they voluntarily 
turn themselves in, Flynn said.
Flynn also said bad weather! 
can wear down escapees and may 
have influenced Berkelbaugh to 
give up. Police planned to resume 
their search for Pontes early Sat-! 
urday morning.
Keller, 36, formerly of Pitts-, 
burgh, received a life sentence in 
1990 for killing a man two years! 
earlier over $6 and the keys to a! 
car.
Pontes, 30, formerly of Lehigh! 
County, was serving 10 1/2 to 24! 
years for burglary and criminal 
conspiracy. Pontes also was con-, 
victed of an escape from a prison; 
in Lehigh County.
Web site aids account access
HUB, from page 1
Stacey Swinehart, a freshman 
design major, agreed with 
Papinchak. She said that the Web 
site saved her some time.
When theres a 20 minute wait 
at the HUB and youre late for 
class, its much easier to just go to 
a cluster and get your schedule 
printout while youre checking 
your e-mail, she said.
Although Papinchak said that 
less foot-traffic has made a differ
ence in the operations at The 
HUB, some of the staff say their 
jobs have not yet been affected by 
the Web site.
Amanda Pracek, a HUB staff 
member said that many students 
still expect The HUB to be re
sponsible for tasks that can be 
accomplished using the Web site. 
Alot of students still arent aware 
that they can access their infor
mation over the Web, Pracek 
said. Until they are aware, the 
job hasnt changed.
Staff member Barbara Gillotti 
agreed that the Web site had not
yet affected her job. Whenit does 
affect us, it will be a positive 
thing. There are some students 
who study their statements [us
ing the Web site], but some just 
dont look at it. Itll be a definite 
help.
Rosemary Lewis, who has 
worked in The HUB since De
cember, said that the Web site 
has brought some problems to 
the attention of students who 
would not have noticed them 
without first looking at the Web 
site. [The Web site] took some 
traffic out, but I think [students] 
were checking the Web and they 
saw incorrect information and it 
brought them into [the office]. 
Maybe this time next year, stu
dents will be comfortable with 
what they see and wont need to 
come down to confirm it. The 
operation of the Web site has 
gone smoothly so far, according 
to Papinchak, who says that ap
proximately 75 percent of the 
feedback has been positive. The 
other 25 percent consists mainly
of complaints that the service 
should be expanded, primarily 
to include on-line registration.
Id be premature if I said any 
kind of timeline, said 
Papinchak, But wed love to 
have a small pilot this Spring. 
But we want to do it right. Thats 
important for students.
Mark Plesko, a freshman com
puter science major, saidthatregistration could be simplified even 
further by putting the service on
line.
They could make it even easier 
if there was on-line registration. 
Its pretty ridiculous that a school 
with this good of a computer sci
ence program doesnt have it yet, 
said Plesko. Other features that 
The HUB would like to add in
clude a way to update address 
information, financial aid 
award, ways to change bio
graphic or demographic facts, 
and a way that parents could 
look at their childs account in
formation while still keeping 
grade information confidential.

opened, after placing the trays
1/10 THEFT, 5:59 pm. A CMU 
student called police to her dorm
room when she discovered that 
her roommate had moved out over 
winter break. The student re
ported that her futon and a fan 
were missing and that she as
sumed her former roommate had 
taken them.
The only people who had access 
to the room over break were the 
former roommate and her boy
friend. The student does not know 
her former roommates new loca
tion.

gel Factory manager reported to 
CMU police that between 6:30 
pm and 6:30 am on January 10, 
someone entered the Bagel 
Factorys cash register and re
moved approximately $90.
The cash register showed no 
sign of forced entry. A CMU Din
ing Services employee told the 
police that he had put $100 in the 
register at 6:30 pm and that a 
clerk card or key is necessary to 
open the cash register.
1/11 THEFT, 9:56 am. While 
CMU police were responding to 
the theft report at the Bagel Fac
tory, the manager of Si Senor
informed police that he was 
missing $30 in quarters from 
the cash register. There were 
no signs of forced entry into the
Si Senor register, and a paper 
tape showed no clerk card activ
ity, indicating that a key had 
been used to open the drawer. 
The Dining Services employee

Shopping period will solve 
registration problems
While CMU students have al
ready jumped into classes that 
they committed to taking several 
months ago, students at some 
other universities, such as Yale 
and MIT, are in the midst of their 
shopping period.
At Yale, the shopping period re
fers to the first two weeks of classes 
each semester. During those two 
weeks students can attend any 
class that is open to them in a sort 
of audit situation. Work done duringthe shopping period counts only 
if the student remains in the class; 
the student is able to get a no
pressure, unskewed overview of 
what the course and the professor 
will really be like.
Giving CMU students a taste of 
their classes before they are actu
ally committed to it would solve 
quite a few problems concerning 
registration procedures and 
would make life easier for stu
dents, professors, and The HUB.
Most importantly, such a sys
tem would allow students to take 
classes that really complement 
their educational and professional 
goals. After required courses, 
many students are faced with the 
opportunity to take a number of 
elective courses, which are usu
ally chosen from a list of courses 
approved by the students home 
department. However, the stu
dent can only guess what the class 
Will be like. The undergraduate 
course catalog descriptions are 
: rarely accurate and dont give a 
; good feel for the course and stu| dents must rely on the hearsay of 
; others who have already taken 
the class. If students were able to 
; audit their classes before regis
tering for them, they would be 
able to decide for themselves 
whether the elective was what 
they thought it would be and if 
they would really benefit from 
the work entailed.
In addition, a shopping period 
system would spare students the 
difficult registration period dur
ing the end of each semester, when 
they are more concerned with 
their success in current courses 
then with deciding what to take 
in the following semester.
It is true that students may reg
ister for a number of classes and 
then drop those they dislike dur
ing the first few weeks of classes. 
However, this practice keeps some 
students out of classes they need 
in order to graduate, as space 
may be taken up by those who 
may later drop the course. This 
extra add/drop period also causes 
extra congestion in The already 
overtaxed HUB. If students were 
allowed a shopping period The 
HUB would see decreased traffic, 
as the flurry of add/drop paper 
work will be condensed from two 
registration periods to one (at the 
end of the shopping period.)
Although professors may lose a 
bit of productivity in the first few 
weeks, they will ultimately gain 
from this system by winding up 
with a class of students who are 
truly interested in the course and 
willing to do the work.
The shopping period system 
works, as is proven by other top 
universities that use it. It could 
solve many of Carnegie Mellons 
registration problems and make 
for satisfied students and profes
sors.
On-line access to HUB 
finally arrives
I After years of waiting for CMU 
; to establish a way for students to 
; obtain information on-line, The 
| HUB has recently implemented a 
:Web site where virtually all as' pects of a students academic and 
financial record are easily acces; sible. While student enrollment 
; information was initially limited 
;to first-year students in certain 
| colleges, the Web site can now 
; access the records of all CMU 
students. Since departments such 
as the registrar, financial aid and 
: enrollment services combined 
'their offices to form The HUB,
; students have been forced to wait 
1 in inefficient lines in order to take 
j care of their enrollment needs.
! But with the implementation of 
; the Web site, frustrating andtime 
: consuming traffic at The HUB 
| has gone down considerably since 
; students only call upon HUB as' sociates if they notice any dis; crepancies in their accounts.
The web site is easily acces; sible; all CMU students thatknow 
: how to access the World Wide 
Web, so they should be able to 
, keep track of any activity taking 
place in their student accounts or 
make sure that The HUB has 
; recognized the changes theyve 
made to their schedules. Itis much 
easier to sit down at a computer 
and find out this kind of informa
tion than to make a trip to the 
basement of Warner Hall where 
its possible to wait up to an hour 
or longer because of the shortage

of HUB associates.
The on-line services of The HUB 
also make it easier to find out 
information when a student is 
studying abroad or even home on 
winter break. Instead of waiting 
for a letter of financial certifica
tion, next semesters class sched
ule, or the current semesters 
grades, students can find out 
about these things through the 
Web site. And students who are 
studying outside of the country 
can track their records no matter 
where they are instead of making 
long distance phone calls or wait
ing until they arrive home.
While CMU has made a signifi
cant effort to catch up technologi
cally with its reputation, The HUB 
Web site has its glitches. Many 
students arent using the Web site 
because the lack of advertising on 
the part of The HUB; students are 
not aware of the services the Web 
site offers and how easy it is to 
access information that used to take 
weeks to receive. Students who do 
use the Web site often access incor
rect records because information is 
not kept up-to-date.
Until the HUB devotes more 
staff and time to its the upkeep 
and development of its new Web 
site, it will not be an effective 
resource. Hopefully the success of 
The HUBs Web site will lead to 
the on-line implementation of 
other services such as registra
tion, a process that most students 
find taxing in its present form.
Day, I learned that Ive lost all ability to interact with the 
outside world. Mind you, I cant decide whether this is a 
positive outcome or not, so I keep my options open and leave 
that for you to decide.
The Hardware Store-y. My mother has arthritis and 
doesnt get around easily. We have a ramp in front of our 
house so she doesnt have to climb stairs.
And on that ramp, since we live inNew Jersey, where it gets 
cold and freezy just like it is here, there are little pieces of 
rounded wood acting as speed bumps, so it provides more 
safety during the winter, rather than turning the ramp into 
a ski jump.
These pieces of wood began to rot from long use, so I was 
sent to the local hardware store to purchase new ones, which 
is fine with me, since Ive been in the house all day doing 
nothing but watching bad religious programming (as if there 
was any other kind of religious programming) and being 
driven utterly insane by my mother asking me if I was still 
hungry.
No, mom, that turkey, stuffing, potatoes, carrot, cranberry 
sauce breakfast we had suits me just fine.
But, its been at least an hour since then, Doug.
So I get to the store with a little piece of sample wood to 
show the lumber man.
Then I came to the realization that I know jack shit about 
what Im actually doing. I dont know how much I need, how 
much it costs, what the wood is called, what kind it is, if I need 
any special ID to order it, and should I have any shots? But 
Im an actor, right? I can fake it.
The lumber guy asks me what I want, as I stand there with 
a fabricated manly glare in my eye. (Wearing a flannel shirt 
and my hat backwards helps the performance.) I look at him. 
I look at the wood. I look at him, and I point.
Uh, I need this. The guy buys this gesture, presumably
thinking I am a macho man of few words, and asks how mud 
I need.
Oh, fifteen, sixteen, whatever it takes. (Can you nan 
what movie thats from? If so you get the weekly prize. Whicl 
of course means, Im going to have to come up with one.)
Okay, son, Ill get that siding for you right away. 
Siding. Finally, I know what to call it.
The lumber guy asks me if I want anything else. Of coma 
I feel stupid now, not being able to name it siding, so I sa; 
yes.
I need some of that stuff you spread on the stuff tha 
freezes.
Well, talk about freezing. I was so wigged out I couldn' 
think of the words: salt and ice. Three cheers for my collegi 
education.
Um, rock salt?
Yeah, rock salt. Please.
Would you like the fifteen- or thirty-pound bag?
Well, I really didnt need any salt at all, but I couldnt bad 
down now. So in my best gruffy, I just killed innoceni 
animals in the woods with an uzi and Im going to go horn 
now, drink lots of beer, and screw my wife voice, I said, Olj

The Plumber. I got back into the Burgh last Saturday, 
was the first of my three roommates to return to my apart

bathroom, right above my bedroom, a pipe burst in twi 
places.
Reality check. Its 9pm on a Saturday night, my room ii

Writer finds goodness in greed
r James Stepanek
Recently, I was having a discussion 
with someone about rich people. The 
person I spoke with had the opinion 
that there are some people who have 
or make too much money.
She then went on to state that 
people shouldnt be so focused on 
making money, but rather on doing 
whatever it is they do best. I must 
admit that at the time I was a little 
dumbfounded since I was talking to 
a conservative, and I generally 
expect a little common sense from 
such people. Heck, she even went 
on to bash people she branded as 
greedy; that is one of the most ri
diculous things Ive ever heard.
Now mind you, greed gets all the 
bad press in the world, and perceiv
ing it as a bad thing is pretty com
mon. This does not, however, mean 
that it actually is a bad thing.
I suppose I may be butting heads 
with common perceptions pretty 
strongly here by using the word 
greed, but lets face it: Greed 
just means self-interest in finan
cial matters. Most people associate 
greed with screwing people over for 
money; this is simply not the case.
One can be greedy and principled. 
Now if money comes before prin
ciple (and law), then there is a prob
lem. However, such cases should 
not impugn the more common situ
ation of those who simply want to 
make money so that they and their 
families are comfortable.
It should not even reflect on the 
cases of people trying to make huge 
amounts of money, since that is their 
business, not ours (as long as they 
follow the rules).
You are probably dismissing my 
defense of greed as a conservative 
rant. Okay, Ill give you the gist of 
the matter: Look around you. Look 
at all the items which make your 
life more comfortable, bearable, and
enjoyable. They are all products of 
greed.
Greed made people plant crops 
instead of continuing as hunter 
gatherers.
Greed improved agriculture so 
that people could specialize in other 
professions.
Greed gave us TVs, computers,
Rebecca Madden/ Tartan Art Staff
automobiles, and all the other con
sumer goods which we accept as 
our due.
Without someone who wanted to 
make money for himself, these 
things would not exist. Why do you 
think the Soviet Union was so tech
nically backward?
They stomped out entrepreneur
ial people who wanted to make 
money; so much for invention and 
progress. It's people working to 
make money for themselves (i.e. 
greedy people), who made this into 
a successful nation.
Greed is what makes the free 
market work, and the free market 
has proved to be, by far, the most 
successful means by which an 
economy can be run.
People, engaging in transactions 
based on their self-interest, will
make sure that resources and capi
tal are allocated in the most effec
tive means possible. This is truly 
amazing: an organized form of chaos 
leads to the best outcomes.
Now many of you are probably 
sympathetic to the notion that we 
should just do the work which we 
feel were best at doing. Let me 
take a little time here to 
explain why thats errone
ous. You should do the 
work which will give some
one cause to pay you a good 
salary.
If this happens to be 
something you like, then 
thats all the better. For 
example, the person whom 
I had been talking to said 
she was going to write a 
book because she felt shed 
be good at it. Okay, one 
can be of that opinion, 
there's nothing wrong with 
that.
However, just because 
you think youd write a 
good book doesnt mean 
what youd produce would 
actually be worthwhile 
and make you money to 
live on. Thats up to the free market 
(in the form of publishers and con
sumers) to determine.
One of the greatest writers in the 
English language, William 
Shakespeare, well understood this, 
and his efforts were based on enter
taining those who would pay for it. 
You see greed is a great motivator. 
Yes, there are others, many of which 
can be even more powerful (eg. re
ligion), but few have ever managed 
to do as much good for the world.
If you compare the anti-greed 
people (communists) with the prod
ucts of capitalism; well, you dont 
have an argument.

Writer attacks the Holocaust Revisionism movement
Editor's Notebook
[The Editors Notebook pre
sents the individual opinions 
of the author only, and not 
necessarily the opinions of 
The Tartan or the Editorial 
Board.]
Last year at Northwestern 
University in Evanston, 111. a 
lecture to be given by a Holo
caust Revisionist was can
celed. The incedent illus
trates a problem that plagues 
colleges and universities 
across the nation: whether or 
not these insitutions are re
stricting free speech.
In order to understand the 
issue completely, it is necessary to examine the motives of 
Holocaust Revisionism. Essen
tially, it seeks to prove cer
tain things about the Holocaust: 
The Nazis did not hold a policy 
of mass-killing of Jews; gas 
chambers were never used; six 
million Jews killed is an exag
gerated figure.
What is the purpose of try
ing to lessen the emotional and 
historical impact of the most 
tragic event of the twentieth 
century?
The Revisionists goal is sim
ply to undermine the reality 
of the Holocaust in an effort to 
satisfy their own anti-Semitic 
sentiments. Yet in research
ing the truth, the Holocaust 
Revisionists ignore a valuable 
primary sourcethe Holo
caust survivor.
Also, to deny the absence of 
a mass-murder policy when 
the Nazis even had a formal 
name for it (the T-4 program) 
is ludicrous.
There is plenty of other evi
dence in place to withstand 
the Revisionist attack, such 
as the existing death camps, 
photos, records, and accounts
ties where their views have been 
disseminated through various 
media sources.
It is important that cam
puses do not assist in circu"Revisionists prey on college stu
dents who are chronologically re
moved from the Holocaust and thus 
more susceptible to buy into their 
views. 
at the Nuremberg Trials.
Holocaust Revisionists are 
targeting campuses nation
wide to spread their propa
ganda. Revisionists prey on 
college students who are chro
nologically removed from the 
Holocaust and thus more sus
ceptible to buy into their 
views.
The Web site even champions 
a list of colleges and universilating this nonsense since it 
cannot possibly benefit soci
ety. Some will argue that ev
erything will offend someone, 
and so the Revisionists might 
as well be allowed exposure. 
That is the wrong approach in 
this case.
Guns, like racism and antiSemitism, are harmful to so
ciety, and so we regulate and 
restrict them even though the
Second Amendment is very 
clear. Choosing not to give ex
posure to Revisionists is not 
shutting the door on free 
speech. These people cer
tainly have the right to say 
what they like.
But much of what they 
choose to say is illusory, and 
a college or university should 
not assist the spread of erro
neous information. I sincerely 
hope that other campuses will 
be aware of the repercussions 
of promoting Revisionist 
rhetoric.
It is important to be sensi
tive to the content of what is 
presented, and in this case, 
the content is often ignored 
in favor of misconstrued First 
Amendment righteousness.

nterest in volleyball team jecomes alive on campus
OLLEYBALL, from page 12
,f time and effort in this year. We 
ictually have a coach.
The teams coach is David Jensen 
;vho has considerable competitive ex
perience having played club volleyjall at the inter-collegiate level for the 
University of Minnesota. Jensen is 
volunteering his services and is not 
affiliated with CMU in any other way.
Gordon Cheng, a junior computer 
science major and another member of 
the competing club team, considers this 
 be a pivotal year as far as volleyball 
jt CMU is concerned. Most people 
jont know that volleyball [at CMU] 
sts. If this year doesnt go well, then 
its going to flop  wed better do well, 
go, if people want to join the club, thats 
reat, especially if youre a freshman or 
sophomore, he said.
Although the team is not too famil
iar with the quality of competition 
they will be facing, Schneider is very 
aware of the approach they will be 
taking. Physically, were a smaller 
team [than the other teams in the 
competition!. Well just have to play 
more defensive volleyball. Cheng also 
expects CMLPs team to be competi
tive. This is my first year but Im 
assuming there wont be too much [of 
a competitive difference] between the 
teams, he said.
Practices are held in the UC, 
onWedn.esdays. and Fridays at 6 pm, 
and on Sundays at 10 pm. There are 
currently 35 active members, and 
about 18 members who will compete 
in the inter-collegiate games but the 
club is, always accepting new mem
bers, according to Schneider.

It was a rough, humbling experience, 
womens head coach Dario Donatelli said, 
describing Carnegie Mellons first in
door track meet of the year. The mens 
and womens track teams traveled about 
100 miles to Kent State University last 
Saturday. Other competitive teams at 
the meet included West Virginia Uni
versity, the University of Pittsburgh, 
and Akron.
Its a little tough because those guys 
started in December, Donatelli said. 
However, the coach was pleased with 
how his top runners performed.
It felt good to be back in competetion, 
said junior hurdler Jeff Jones, but I 
definitely felt rusty. Jones, the only 
hurdler the men took to the meet, is 
trying to return to form. He last ran at 
the University Athletic Association Out
door Championships two years ago. 
I hit a lot of hurdles, obviously, he said.
Jones hopes to help the team out in the 
400 meters. After racing against fast 
opponents at Kent State he said: It was 
hard to get my legs moving fast again, 
but it was a good experience.
Sophomore Alice Chong set an indoor 
record for Carnegie Mellon in throwing 
the 35 lb weight. Her distance of 35 feet, 
10 inches should compare well against 
conference throwers.
Right now its probably top five, 
Coach Donatelli said of the mark. Since 
its still early in the season, and competi
tors performances havent made it 
around the conference yet, it was hard 
for the coach to speculate.
The women look to field a young, but 
experienced team. Its hard to tell, said 
junior Kerry Riley on evaluating the 
team, theres a lot of freshmen on it.
I think that we have a lot more 
strengths s'printing-wise, Riley said. 
Riley indicated that the womens 
sprinting squad is a young group. The 
team features two freshmen, two sopho
mores, in addition to one junior. Al
though the distance runners for the 
women mostly underclassmen they are 
also experienced.
According to former All-American and
current womens assistant coach Missy 
Baustert, sophomores Maureen 
McGranaghan and Margaret Powers did 
well at UAA last year. The two also 
performed well at the meet.
Margaret Powers ran very well, 
Baustert said. The assistant coach said 
that Carnegie Mellons women have ... 
one of the best group of distance runners 
in the UAA.
Powers lowered her personal record 
to 5:15 in the mile with a third place 
finish. McGranaghan and freshman 
teammate Andrea Byrnes were right 
behind in 5:28 and 5:33 respectively. 
McGranaghan came in second among 
collegiate runners in the 3000 with a 
time of 10:36.1.
I think the girls trained hard over 
break and thats good, she said, but 
wouldnt speculate on their chances in 
the conference championship this early 
in the season. Its hard to say right now, 
theyre still getting in shape.
The long distance runners on the mens 
side are looking to improve over a suc
cessful cross country season. The cross 
country team finished 16th nationally. 
Student/athletes making the jump to 
shorter distances include senior Ron 
Polcawich, sophomore Josh Donner, 
sophomore Kristo Kriechbaum, and 
freshman Bryan Meyer. Donner is opti
mistic that the team will fare well.
[There is a] lot of talent on this team, 
a lot of potential, good work ethic, good 
coaching, said Donner.
Donner, senior Seb Ziesler (another 
cross country runner), and Meyer all fin
ished under 9:17 in the 3000 in what was 
the best showing for the men of the day.
We havent really had a chance to 
practice many of the field events, mens 
head Coach Meckley said. The team 
didnt take any pole vaulters. I hate; to 
take somebody this early, it can get. a 
little dangerous.
Junior high jumper Peter Hunt, who 
missed his opening height of 6 4 at the. 
meets, hopes improve on the high marks , 
he reached during the brief periods-ihat 
he was healthy last season. FreshmanTodd Kozuki missed opening heightrin 
the event, but Meckley was please with 
the 19 foot performance Kozuki put up 
in the long jump.
The optimist in me says we can ac
complish a lot, Meckley said of the mens 
prospects. The pessimist in me makes 
me shudder at what I say.
The cold weather has influenced the 
teams practicing schedules, but the team 
hopes to improve their conditioning be
fore the Indoor UAA Championships 
February 28 through March 1. Brandeis 
Universitywill host the even this year. 
Its been hard to get outside, assistant 
coach Baustert said.

[EENAN, from page 12
le bench, but also the job behind 
le scenes.
Keenan acclimated quickly to 
(is new post, immediately and 
onstantly shuffling players on 
he roster. One of the earliest and 
lost detrimental trades was the 
cquisition of young defenseman 
ihris Pronger from the Hartford 
Whalers, for veteran power-foryard Brendan Shanahan. A St. 
liOuis fan favorite, as well as 
iulls, Shanhans departure 
ipened everyones eyes to just 
low erratic Keenan could be. 
JThe Blues became a revolving 
oor. All-Star goaltender Curtis 
eph, along with Petr Nedved, 
sa Tikkannen, and Craig 
itrney soon found themselves in 
_ cities. Keenan brought in 
Sture Hall-of-Famers Wayne 
$retzky and Dale Hawerchuk, as 
tall as Craig MacTavish, only to 
ose each within a year of signing. 
Not every move was a disaser. He brought in Pierre 
'urgeon and Hull finally had a 
etup man for the first time 
jince Adam Oates had left for 
Boston. But when forwards 
ieoff Courtnall, Joe Murphy, 
nd Brian Noonan each signed 
hree-year deals, unfortu
nately at a much higher 
(rice than they were 
vorth, (Courtnall for $6.6 
niUion; Murphy, $10 milion; Noonan, $2.8 million)
Qore heads shook in diselief. Murphy, after only 
scoring 22 goals the sea
son before, was supposedly 
bought in to replace 
Gretzky. Replace Gretzky? 
Then there were the conitant rumors of bad blood 
ween Brett Hull and 
oach/GM Keenan. When!ver the Blues would slump,
-he media would report on 
Routing matches at prac
tices between the coach and 
his disgruntled star, 
^eenan, in an assertion of 
}ower, stripped the 50 goal 
f corer of his captaincy dur
ing the 1995-96 season.
It doesnt matter who wears 
the C. Everyone knows who the 
real captain of this team is, Hull 
was quoted as saying in response 
to Keenans decision.
In the end, the two just couldnt 
agree. Someone had to go. When 
Hull released a list of teams that 
he would consider being traded 
to last November, the Blues knew 
that they had to act fast or they 
would lose the cornerstone of 
their organization.
They cant do a thing, said the 
Bruins Harry Sinden after the 
Murphy signing. And when 
Sinden, arguably the worst GM 
in NHL history, is commenting 
on how bad of a manager you are, 
there needs to be a change. Dur
ing last weeks interview on 
ESPNs Up Close, Hull men
tioned that he thought that 
Keenan would still have been 
coach of the Blues today had he 
not also performed GM duties. 
Hull was right. Keenan should 
not have been general manager. 
He is a coach, and a damn good 
one at that. But just because you 
can coach talent does not mean 
you can evaluate it.
Keenan was too excited about 
the power of having a team to
mold, build, and lead to a cham
pionship. That was what the 
Blues thought that they wanted 
from him. That is what he does. 
But when given the power to 
trade, he was deadly. His caustic 
coaching style did not lend itself 
well to the general managers 
position. Keenan didnt think 
about team chemistry, a key ele
ment to stability and success, and 
it showed in the biting, wild 
changes that he made to the club. 
He learned the hard way that you 
do not just throw together a bunch 
of good players to win a champi
onship. You need to criticize as 
well as support, not make moves 
that alienate your fans and your 
star players, and never ever ever 
criticize the Great One for inef
fective play, even if he is playing 
shuffleboard.
Chris Adukaitis is a senior civil 
and environmental engineering 
major who hopes the Blues will 
finally be good again now that 
Keenan is finally gone.
Jessica Strelitz is a junior pro
fessional writing major who loves 
it when guys throw their sticks at 
her during hockey practice and

People are talking about Bell Atlantic
"I'd read about Bell Atlantic in prominent newspapers and magazines, 
and then I saw several posters on campus that they were coming to Georgia 
Tech to interview.
Right from the start, I knew that Id be working with one of the most 
dynamic and ambitious corporations in the world. The opportunities to 
grow and move within the company were unlimited. Bell Atlantic -would 
be great for my career for a long time to come.
One of the most important criteria for me in choosing Bell Atlantic was its 
support for continuing education. Within ?nonths of beginning my job, I 
enrolled in an International Business Program at Georgetown University.
At Bell Atlantic, an employee is not only free to pursue further studies but 
is actively encouraged, and then recognized for it. 
Ive had many opportunities to discuss both simple and complex issues with 
people from many departments in both one-on-one settings and in team -
environments even with company Vice Presidents. It was great to see -
that a new college hire could feel at ease to air his views freely to senior 
executives.
Communication is what its all about here. Bell Atlantic plays an important role in providing the infrastructure 1
and services for people to communicate ivorldwide. It enables both personal and business communication, via voice, data 1 j 
and video media. It is therefore, the heart of communication.'

Club Hockey team gets back on track, improves
HOCKEY, from page 12
them to head in deep toward the net. Firing from 
the blue line, the puck slipped under the RMC 
goaltender putting CMU up 2-1. A minute later, 
going for a line change, starting goalie freshman 
Si) Min cleared the puck to returning captain 
Roger Maddalena who found Buck heading up the 
right-hand side of the ice. He skated till he was 
almost at an impossible angle with the net and 
drew out the goalie to put the puck up and in, 
etting CMUs lead to 3-1.
, On the next shift, CMUs second line followed 
suit with junior defenseman Dave Mitzel send
ing the puck into the zone and getting the shot on 
n^t, kicked out by the RMC tender and kept in 
play by senior Relja Ivanovic who found Ardire 
through the chaos in front of RMCs net. Ardire, 
\Mio had been off skates for 10 months before the 
pnghts game, scored his second of the night at 
ii.3'6, setting the score at 4-1. The third line 
quickly jumped to the ice and Mitzel, still skating out his defensive shift, capitalized on the 
great stickwork of freshman Rio Ota and return
ing sophomore Andy Oxnard, scoringwhatturned 
out to be the game winner with a fantastic bounce 
off the back of the RMC goaltenders right pad. 
Oxnard attributed his play to the increased com
munication on the ice between him and his de
fensive partner, grad-student assistant captain 
Blair Echols.
Eight second later, the second line returned 
with Fitzgerald and Ardire centering the puck 
from around the back of the net, directly onto 
Ivanovics stick to solidify CMUs lead to 6-1. 
Adding to the comfortable lead was the aggressive 
defensive work of Echols and junior Paul Voulgaris, 
who slammed their way through RMC pressure to 
free the puck for the CMU offense. Adding to the 
defensive excitement was Mins adeptness with a 
glove save on a RMC breakaway and heads-up 
play by rookies Matt Williams, P.J. Grzywacz, 
and Ota. The second period, which ended with a
6-2 CMU lead and five goals on 15 shots, was the 
epitome of a team effort.
The team knew that they had to hold the pres
sure in the third. RMC was visibly upset when they 
retook the ice and their passion turned to scoring. 
CMU bit right back with Echols getting the puck to 
Ivanovic and Ivanovic getting his own rebound to 
score. Frustrated, RMC began to take runs at the 
smarter CMU squad who simply continued to stall 
the RMC effort. Voulgaris continued his highly 
defensive-minded game and Ardire added his ef
forts to shut down the last minute RMC flurry of 
activity and end the game in a 7^1 CMU victory. 
Rookie goaltender Min had 18 saves in the win, 
CMUs second victory theyve notched over RMC 
this season.
Commented coach Fred Maddalena, Its great to 
be back playing again. RMC is much improved, and 
they played a tight game. We had some times that 
we played really well and others we were flat.
When asked about the triumphant return of 
Ardire (three points), Maddalena (one point), and 
Oxnard (one point) he said,  We had Roger and 
Andy come back from injury and they look good. 
And we had Ray come back from football and he 
looked, well, like a linebacker.
Saturday nights game was all about discipline. 
New York University was determined to avenge 
their first half of the season loss to CMU at home. 
They had made the eight-hour trip to Pittsburgh 
after getting thumped by Central Connecticut State 
the night before 8-0. But with only two full lines 
to CMUs full four, they were outmatched and 
outplayed throughout while CMU showed the signs 
of championship contender.
Coach Maddalena kept the shifts short, allowing 
the players to be better rested and mentally pre
pared to make good plays throughout the short
ened shift.
CMUs first line scored late in the first period with 
Maddalena and Adukaitis controlling the play and 
setting Buck. His goal added to their dominance as 
a.unit, having the majority of shots in the game 
including several breakaways. The first period was 
quiet and quick and ended with 17 CMU shots to 
five NYU attempts, with a score of 1-0.
CMU capitalized on their passing and setting 
skills in the second period, creat
ing several important plays, only 
to be stoned by the swift NYU 
goalkeeper. A quick goal by NYU 
tied the score at 1-1. Starting 
CMU tender Min faced a handfull of hard shots in close.
Tonights game was the tough
est kind of game because your 
team is dominating and you need 
to make timely saves on fewer 
shots. He got defensive help from 
Grzywacz, who controlled the 
puck behind the net and made 
smart moves to get the puck to 
Ardire and clear the zone. Ardire 
continued down the ice, deking 
past four NYU players, to put the 
puck in the middle of the side of 
the net for CMU. NYU scored 
again minutes later to keep the 
pace at 2-2. Both teams went to
record to 6-6-1 ,
the locker rooms with a possibility for the win? i;  
Pressures of a tight game kick started the ndrs  
squad in the third. They were deadlocked for 1( 
minutes, forced to kill off penalties. Adukaitis, 
senior Anthony Paul, and sophomore Steve 
Leonhart worked hard during the expended pen- E 
alty kill. Something had to give when the combina [ 
tion of Fitzgerald, junior forward Derek Jandq 
(who had played back-up goal the night before} 
and Ardire connected, with Ardire down low on the 
NYU net. Ardire shot and got his own rebound to 
triumphantly put CMU permanently in the lead 
for the game, 3-2.
Min continued to make great kick and glove 
saves, keeping the momentum whenever his team** 
mates were beaten by the NYU rush. In the last 
few minutes, victory in sight, the first line combi
nation of Maddalena and Adukaitis ended the 
period exactly how they began it with Adukaitis 
giving a beautiful dish to Buck, who finished the 
play and the scoring to set the final score at 4-2, 
Carnegie Mellon.
Coach Maddalena commented Friday night that 
Indiana University of Pennsylvania, next 
Saturdays game, was going to be a must-have win. 
Assistant coach Tom Sullivan agreed, We are still 
out of shape from the break and we are going || 
need to bring it up even more to beat a team likfif 
IUP. [NYU] was not heavy hitting but the other 
teams in the division are. "
Ardire, who had four goals and an assist in twJ 
nights added, This team has a good chance in the 
playoffs. We are getting opportunities and not giving 
up any plays. We have good young players, especially 
Gil who played awesome in goal. Min, who had $ 
saves on the night for his second win in two days said;
 It was a team win. This is a whole new team, weve 
picked up two top lines since first semester.
Jim Buck, who ajso had two goals on the night as 
the teams top scorer, was encouraged by CMtftj 
play, I think that we played pretty well, for our 
third time out on the ice in a month, and we can 
only get better. ,
Coach Maddalena was even more enthusiastic,, 
We are going to be in the playoffs guaranteed.^ t

fore the last day of finals, when 
most CMU students had already 
left for the break. Even so, patches 
of Tartan fans could be heard 
cheering in Pitts Fitzgerald 
I^ldhouse. The Tartans last beat 
Q,ttsburgh in mens basketball 
Qfl,March 1,1969, and before then 
ij)JL954. Both games were played 
at.Carnegie. CMU lost to the Pan
thers the next few seasons before 
the game was discontinued. 
v^When its press was unsuccess
ful, Pitt utilized a 1-3-1 zone to 
Ijgpp shot blocker Mark Blount 
%ge to swat shoots. Both blocks 
TO center had were recorded 
before half time, as the box score 
inexplicably left out many oth
ers.
'They were a lot bigger, stron
ger than wed seen, said senior 
civil and environmental engineer 
ip&jor Gary Trendall, who led
Carnegie Mellon with seven 
rebounds.
The Tartans were out-re
bounded 47-26 by the bigger 
team. The points came from 
everywhere for Pitt. Five Pan
thers finished with double fig
ures in scoring, while no player 
took more than 11 shots.
Although they would have 
liked a closer game, CMU was 
enthusiastic about the contest.
If Pitt would like to play 
this game again, Im all for it, 
Coach Wingen said.
I hope they continue to play 
a big game every year, 
Trendall said.
Tartan men fight, but fall to Pittsburgh
PITT, from page 12
said Bowersox.... and then I had 
two fouls.
Now with both centers in foul 
trouble, starting forward Chris 
Butsko was the biggest man the 
Tartans had on the court for most 
of the half.
I think he handled himself real 
well, Bowersox said of Butskos 
play.
We felt we could maintain the 
lead or at least stay close, said 
Wingen of his team, which took a 
29-26 lead into halftime.
The second half featured more 
lead changes as the pace became 
more frenzied until the finish. The 
Tartans, who used a full court press
frequently in both halves, also exer
cised manyy half court defensive 
sets.
We feel we have to throw some 
wrinkles at them, said Wingen. 
Were a better zone team than 
we are a man-to-man [team]. 
The team used variations of a 2- 
3 defense to confuse Johns 
Hopkins. The defense was strong, 
but eventually the offense would 
prove lacking.
Our game is inside, said 
Wingen. The team pounded the 
ball in to Trendel, who scored six 
of its first eight points in the 
second half. Later in the half the 
Tartans would stagnate.
I think tonight a lot of times on
offense we didnt execute as well 
as we could, said starting guard 
LaDale Widmeyer.
Because of our shooting, we go 
through dry spells where we just 
dont score points, said Wingen, 
were not good enough to fight 
through things like that to win 
games.
Tonight we had two streaks 
where we couldnt get a basket, 
Widmeyer said.
After a hoop at 11:57, a jumper 
by Praesel was the sole source of 
scoring in a three-minute dry 
spot before Colin Shaunnessey 
scored a bucket with 8:30 re
maining. Nearly two minutes 
later, Kevin Cackovic gave the
Tartans their last lead, 46-45 
on a drive to the hoop off a higj 
pick. From there the men won] 
go over five minutes without scor 
ing before Rich Bodnar drains 
a three with 1:23 remaining 
Bodnar led CMU with 10 rj 
bounds.
Thats been the story all yea 
long.... Our effort is fantastij 
Guys are out there throwing the; 
bodies all over the floor, Winge]

New faces and old hats appear at Superbowl
Patriots will end NFC dominance
From the Goal Line
by Ronak Singhal
My first column of the football season 
predicted that the Green Bay Packers 
would defeat the Pittsburgh Steelers in 
Super Bowl XXXI. But now, only six days 
before the Big Game, I am predicting 
that the unheralded New England Patri
ots will invade New Orleans and defeat 
Green Bay. Why the sudden change of 
heart? Mainly because the Steelers are 
out of the playoffs. But seriously, the 
New England Patriots will win not only 
because of their diversified offense and 
surprising defense, but also because of 
the mere presence of a graduate of Towson 
State University, Dave Meggett.
How can a running back who did not 
score a single rushing or receiving touch
down all season determine the fate of this 
game? Well, its not what Meggett will do, 
but what he has already done that en
sures that the Patriots will win this game.
The entire complexion of this years 
playoffs changed on a single play made 
by a single individual. On the last Satur
day of the regular season, the Patriots 
visited the Meadowlands to take on the 
best team that New York City had to 
offer. If the Patriots won this game, they 
would clinch a first-round bye, but a loss 
combined with a Pittsburgh Steeler vic
tory the next day would give the Steelers 
the bye.
However, the New York Giants in the 
first half of that game were not the 
hapless fools that they had been all 
throughout the rest of the season. In
stead, they ran out to a 22-0 lead and 
the NBC half-time crew started talking 
about what the Steelers needed to do 
the next day to beat the Carolina Pan
thers.
But the Giants reverted to their hap
less ways in the second half and seemed 
decidedly uninterested in mustering any 
offense; in the process, the Patriots were 
given a chance to come back. With the 
score 22-10, the Giants were forced to 
punt once again. Returning back the 
kick was Meggett, who called the Mead
owlands home during the Giants glory 
days. He took the punt on the fly and 
scampered 60 yards virtually untouched 
for a touchdown that brought the Pats 
within five points.
After that play, the Giants were too 
shell-shocked to accomplish anything, 
least of all stopping the momentum of 
the Pats. Ben Coates caught a Bledsoe 
pass for a last-minute TD and the Pats 
won 23-22. As a result of this game, the 
Steelers had nothing to play for the next 
day and rested most of their starters. 
Still, they gave the Carolina Panthers a 
run for their money before succumbing; a 
win that also gave the Panthers their 
division crown.
What would have happened had 
Meggett not returned that punt for a TD?
Although hypothetical, it is entirely 
conceivable that the Patriots would 
not have come back and that the 
Steelers, using their starters, would 
have defeated the Panthers. This would 
have given the Steelers and 49ers firstround byes and home games in the 
second round, while forcing the Pan
thers and Patriots to play in the firstround. Clearly, the outcome of these 
playoffs would most likely be different 
if that scenario had been played out. 
But karma and Dave Meggett are on 
the side of the New England Patriots 
this year.
It takes a special team with (usually) 
a special coach to win a Super Bowl. 
The Patriots have rebounded from an 
0-2 start and now their spectacular 
offense has been combined with an un
heralded defense that has given up no 
touchdowns in the last 10 quarters. 
They also have a coach in Bill Parcells 
that is 2-0 in Super Bowls. To para
phrase Newton, an object in motion 
tends to stay in motion. Dave Meggetts 
punt return in the regular season set in 
motion a series of events that is too 
strong to stop. Forget the NFC domina
tion and take the underdogs this year.
New England 27 - Green Bay 17.

Packers will bring titletown a trophy
4th and 26
by Steve Charnoubi
Only a handful of individuals today in 
the world of sports can be considered the 
best to ever play their sport. Athletes like 
Michael Jordan, Wayne Gretzky, and 
Jerry Rice have taken their game to an
other level and have already become leg
ends in the sports they play. Super hu
man ability and championships usually 
go hand in hand, but for Reggie White, 
the best defensive lineman to ever play 
football, this Sunday will mark his first 
trip to the Super Bowl.
The NFL all-time sack leader started 
his NFL career in Philadelphia anchor
ing an Eagles defense that at one time 
ranked first against the ran, pass, and 
overall. In 1993, following a dispute with 
the Eagles management, Reggie White 
left Philadelphia in search of a team who 
could give him what he hungered for 
most in the world: a Super Bowl ring on 
his finger. The Green Bay Packers con
vinced Reggie that they could take ium 
to the Super Bowl, and now four years 
later Reggie White and the Green $ay 
Packers will be battling the New En
gland Patriots in New Orleans for Super 
Bowl XXXI.
Green Bay won Super Bowl I andJTI> 
but since then have not had the chaiice 
to compete for the Lombardi tropliy 
named after the man who coached 
Green Bay to their two Super Bowl 
wins. With Vince Lombardis ghfjst 
guiding them through the 1996 season, 
albeit through the use of cheesy Nike 
commercials, the Packers should dotfclnate a game their conference has b6&n 
dominating for the last twelve years. 
The New England Patriots lost to Etie 
Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XIX to 
begin the NFCs Super Bowl winning 
streak.
Green Bays defense, with the addition 
of Reggie White, has become one of tKfe 
top units in the league. Reggies ability to 
consistently put pressure on the quar
terback despite double or even tripie 
teams leads a defensive line with two 
pass-rushing veterans in Sean J ones and 
Santana Dotson, and a huge run-stopper 
in Gilbert which should man-handle'.'a 
relatively unknown Patriot offensive liide 
enabling them to slow down Pittsburgh 
alumnus Curtis Martin and disrupt Drew 
Bledsoes passing. Green Bay has Ke 
match-up they want with Pro-B owl safety 
Leroy Butler covering tight end Ben 
Coates. Safety Eugene Robinson, Who 
has intercepted more passes (34) in the 
NFL than any other player in the 1990s, 
joins comerbacks Craig Newsome and 
Doug Evans in a secondary that should 
be able to control Patriots receivers Terry 
Glenn and Shawn Jefferson.
Back in July, Brett Favre guaranteed 
that his Packers would be in the Super 
Bowl. Following a brilliant season whi^h 
earned him his second consecutive NFL 
MVP award and two playoff home victo
ries the Packers are exactly where Brett 
Favre said they would be. Look for Favafe 
to pick apart the Patriots secondary 
using targets like wide receiver Antoitid 
Freeman, tight end Keith Jackson, and 
running backs Edgar Bennett anki 
Dorsey Levens. Favres biggest chal
lenge will come from blitzing monstfei' 
Willie McGinest, however having twio 
all-pro tight ends in Jackson and Mack 
Chmura will give Brett Favre the extra 
protection he needs to dismantle the 
Patriots defense. "
Both Brett and Reggie are hungry: 
You can see it in their eyes and youll see 
it reflected on the field by their pla#: 
Look for Favre to win the game on of
fense and White to win it on defense. The 
Green Bay Packers will win the Super 
Bowl giving all their players from former 
Bills receiver Don Beebe (0-4 in the 
Super Bowl) to Reggie White their long-; 
awaited NFL Championship.
Green Bay 34 - New England 11
Steve Charnoubi is a junior computer; 
science major who's happy to see a Super; 
Bowl without Dallas or San Francisco 
playing in it. He probably thinks that; 
Philadelphia Eagles will win the Super, 
Bowl next year.

Men fall to Pittsburgh, Johns Hopkins
On the Net
by Jessica Strelitz 
and Chris Adukiatis
In mid-December of 1996, the St. Louis 
Blues fired their coach and general man
ager, Mike Keenan. When faced with the 
possibility of losing their star right-winger, 
Brett Hull, the St. Louis brass decided to 
boot Keenan, despite having two and a half 
years left on his ten million dollar contract.
" Youve got to under
stand one thing about 
Mike. He comes with an 
expiration date. 
-Anonymous
Youve got to understand one thing about 
Mike. He comes with an expiration date,
: an unknown speaker said after Keenan left 
the New York Rangers.
Keenan has long been acknowledged as 
!one oftheNHLs best coaches. In his former 
stints with the Flyers and Blackhawks, he 
lead both teams to the Stanley Cup finals 
twice. Of course he recently is best known 
for his time coaching in the Big Apple, 
where he took the Rangers to the Cup  
ending their fifty-four year drought. Iron 
Mike quickly jumped over to the Blues 
after the 93-94 season, shocking everyone, 
especially the Rangers club that he was 
still under contract with. Why did he leave 
a championship team in a city where he 
was being hailed as a savior? Simple: the 
Blues offered him not only the job behind

The Carnegie Mellon ice hockey club 
reached the .500 mark for the first time 
this season, opening the second half of 
their season with back to back wins over 
Robert Morris College and New York 
University, improving their overall 
record to 6-6-1.
Carnegie Mellon faced Robert Moris 
College in Moon on Friday night. In his 
spring semester debut, senior forward 
Ray Ardire made his presence known in 
under fives minutes by rapping in the 
first tally of the game with an assist by 
junior forward Scott Fitzgerald. But Rob
ert Morris, unlike previous contests, did 
not let up. They hustled twice as fast to 
the puck and put up a strong fight for
possession. Minutes after the Ardire goal, 
RMC scored, tying the game 11. CMU was 
stunned by the aggressive spirit that RMC 
was showing by outshooting the Tartan squad 
7-6 in the first period which ended dead
locked at 1-1.
But the CMU hockey club is a fiery bunch. 
They all know that every game counts, espe

Late rally falls short

The Carnegie Mellon womens basketball team suf
fered a tough loss to Johns Hopkins University 56-50 
Friday night at Skibo Gymnasium. Despite a 32-23 
deficit at half-time, the Tartans rebounded and pulled 
within two points with a minute left in the game. 
Unfortunately for the Tartans, they had to foul and 
Johns Hopkins hit four out of their last five free 
throws while the Tartans couldnt seem to hit a des
perately needed three-pointer.
This was an impressive performance, considering 
the fact the Tartans turnover to assist ratio was 
almost two to one. We had too many turnovers. We 
panicked a little bit, said coach Gerry Seidl. Johns 
Hopkins was a good team though, as four of their 
players scored in double digits and two players were in 
double digits for rebounds. This was an excellent 
team, said Seidl.
Leading the way for the Tartans was senior guard 
Penny Davis, who scored 17 points while adding nine 
rebounds and two assists in 32 minutes of play. Senior 
guard Kelly Gaitens came ofthe bench to hit two threepointers while scoring a total of seven points. Fresh
man guard Lacey Perretta and senior guard Kristin 
Kupfer both added six points. Kupfer unfortunately
for womens hoops
got injured during the game and was not able t< 
contribute as much as the team needed.
When Kristin went down and got injured, I don? 
know if she could keep her play up [sic], said Seidl. Tht 
Tartans did do two things quite well during the game 
defense and defensive rebounding.
Our defense was exceptional, said Seidl.
They held Johns Hopkins to a 32.8 field goal percent 
age, which is excellent. Johns Hopkins also played 
great defense though, holding the Tartans to a 29j 
field goal percentage. On the defensive boards, 
Tartans outrebounded Johns Hopkins. Freshman cen 
ter Samantha Majemik grabbed six defensive boards 
and Kupfer had five. The Tartans, however, could noi 
carry this rebounding mentality on the offensive side 
as they were outrebounded by Hopkins.
We needed to improve the number of offensive 
boards, said Seidl.
In addition to the number of turnovers and the lack 
of offensive play, the Tartans had to play the referees 
who consistently made questionable calls.
The officials were bad. I dont blame the officials, but 
they made a difference in this game, said Seidl. There 
were several fouls called and traveling violations that 
could have easily have gone the other
Greensburg on Wednesday in
In what head coach Tony Wingen described as 
a no-lose situation [Carnegie Mellon News 
Volume 4, Number 8] on December 16, the 
Carnegie Mellon mens basketball team was de
feated by the University of Pittsburgh 84-39.
Our guys knew [theyd have] to do everything 
right, just to stay in the game, said Wingen.
The Tartans started off right, twice taking 
early leads on two three-pointers by mechanical 
engineering major, junior Andy Sofish. The game 
remained close for the first ten minutes of play, 
until Pitt opened up their first 10 point lead with 
7:39 remaining in the half.
We would have liked to stay with them a 
little longer, said Sofish, who led the Tartans 
with 11 points.
A combination of relentless pressure and some 
carelessness would doom the squad.The Pan

first half on the strength of 11 steals.
We wont see anybody wholl pressure us like 
this for the rest of the year, CMU Head Coach

Probably we would have liked to handle their 
pressure a little longer, Sofish said.
The Tartans were not entirely dominated by 
Pitts full court press. Often times, their guards 
would not capitalize on superior numbers after 
breaking the press and become trapped again at 
half court by recovering defenders. Even when 
CMU pressed its advantage, opposing defenders 
were usually in place to intimidate shots.
The Panthers used a 14-4 run over the next six 
minutes to open the margin to twenty and effec
tively put the game away.
Nevertheless, CMU played with valiant inten
sity throughout the second half. The Tartans did

Speaker recounts African tales
By BETTY SHEA
Tartan Staffwriter
While cold gusts of wind froze Pitts
burgh sidewalks last Saturday, the 
air inside Phipps Conservatory was 
warm, thick, and moist. The conserva
tory was alive with the colors of its 
flowers and trees. It was also alive 
with Bob Gores narration of tradi
tional African tales.
Gore is a 65-year-old professional 
African storyteller. I go to schools 
frequently, mostly elementary 
schools. But Ive been asked to per
form in middle schools and high 
schools, colleges, family reunions, 
churches.... All the stories I tell are 
African .... [except] Ive added one re
cently from India ... because it was 
just so good I couldnt pass it up. I 
target any [age] group. Ive also been 
to the Lemmington Center for the 
Aged in East Liberty, he said.
Gores most recent appearance, last 
Saturday in Phipps Conservatory, 
was arranged by Bob Alexander, 
Phipps Conservatorys head of educa
tion. Gores one-hour performance at
tracted both attentive adult and chil
dren listeners. Now and then, passersby would stop to listen to a tale or 
two. Each tale was just a few minutes 
long, and Gore punctuated his per
formance with songs and activities 
for the children.
When asked whether Martin Luther 
King Day had anything to do with 
Alexanders choice ofthe performance 
date, Gore said, Im certain that [Mar
tin Luther King Day] is the reason ... 
because I performed about the same 
time last year.
In part, Gore treats his storytelling 
as a constant effort to bridge dispari
ties between different groups of people. 
What I hope is that some of these 
kinds of stories will begin to subtly 
sensitize [children].... [But] its not 
helpful if [children] go home and their 
mother or father says, Were there 
any niggers in your class? That tears 
down anything I couldve tried to do. 
And that kind of thing does still go 
on.... But at any rate, Im still hopeful. 
Im very, very hopeful.
Gore claimed to be a pacifist at heart.

When talking about his own views on the 
use of violence, he said, You have to teach 
ycAirself to be violent, so why not teach 
yourself to be non-violent? And the out
come of non-violence is so much greater.... 
Violence has been tried for hundreds and
thousands ofyears, and it ____________
has rarely worked. Itmay 
have stalled some things, 
but it has rarely worked.
Although acknowl
edging that nowadays 
racism against African 
Americans is signifipantly less that before,

there is much work to be done. Un
fortunately, we live in this fractured 
society in America where you have 
one group of people going one way 
and one group going another way, 
He said. But theres got to be, I think,
a constant effort to join these people 
together.
In choosing his repertoire, Gore 
stresses the importance of the enter
taining qualities in a story. He said, 
The major reason [I choose a story] is 
that I just like telling it.... The first

thing I have in mind when Im telling 
stories is to entertain.... But ... a sec
ondary, more subtle, thing is that all 
these stories have some little messages 
in them. Ive made it a practice not to 
ask the kids, What does that [the moral
of the story] mean? I trust that the 
subtle message gets to them.
Gore mentioned what Carnegie Mellon 
students could do to continue Kings work 
of narrowing the gap between different 
races. I think the first thing... is to use your 
time wisely ... and not to forget the very 
reason you are there, which is to 
soak up all the knowledge you 
can,he said. Now, on the other 
hand, there are a lot of things 
you are not going to get in the 
classroom, but are available to 
you right there: interactions 
with people unlike yourself. 
Sure thats scary, but so what?
Takeariskbecauseyouarent

Council helps first-year students adjust

plore both the academic and the social 
sides of the college experience and 
I When upperclassmen look back at how the two work, or fail to work, 
their first semester of college, they together.
most likely remember being over- Tobin Coziahr, a University Choice 
whelmed by the workload, surprisingly freshman planning to major in electrilarge lecture halls, and the new free- cal and computer engineering and inIdomthey suddenly acquired. CMU has formation and 
recognized these common feelings of decision systems, 
first-year students and has formed the is representing 
University First-Year Council in order 
to help first-year students successfully 
adjust to CMUs rigorous academic en
vironment. It is nice to know that 
there is a group organized to help make 
;t!he transition easier, said Abhi Sheth, 
a freshman public policy and manage
ment major.
The council, chaired by Ed Ko, vice 
provost for Education, is comprised of
15 members, representing many de
partments throughout the University, 
ranging from the office of Student Af
fairs to the school of Computer Science 
and the Eberly Center for Teaching 
Excellence. We believe it is important 
to take an integrated approach to im
prove the total development of our stu
dents, said Ko.
 According to Ko, the mission of the 
council is to understand the intellectual, 
social, emotional, and cultural adapta
tion and development that first-year 
students experience, and to work with 
faculty and students to enhance and 
provide a context for these experiences.
Implementing first-year programs that 
integrate the efforts of faculty, stu
dent, and student affairs staff, all 
in order to better the quality of 
life for first-year CMU students 1
is another element of the 
councils mission.
The First-Year Council is 
an important new initiative 
for Carnegie Mellon because 
it can take a broad perspec
tive on the students experience dur
ing the formative first college year,
the class of 2000 on the council. 
There is always room for improve
ment, said Coziahr. The council 
is currently helping the orienta
tion process fit closer to fresh
man needs.
We are actually collecting 
data from students and trying 
to improve the first-year [experience] 
based on their input, said council 
said council member John Hayes, pro- member Tresa Pollock, associate pro
fessor and director of the Center for fessor of materials science and engi
neering. This information is being col
lected through surveys completed by 
freshmen in selected courses, regard
ing both their reactions towards the 
orientation activities and their aca
demic experiences. This will most likely 
result in changes to the orientation 
program for next fall. I am looking 
forward to seeing the changes the FirstYear Council is going to implement for 
orientation and how it improved from 
the orientation program we experi
enced, said Chris Skiadas, a fresh
man industrial management major, 
planning to be an orientation counse
lor for the upcoming freshman class.
In addition to trying to implement 
changes to freshmen orientation, the 
council is trying to develop programs 
that will improve the students learning, 
such as help with time management and 
study skills.
Last semester the council also spon
sored two pilot workshops for instruc
tors and teaching assistants of firstyear students. The goal is for people 
who teach freshman to have a better 
understanding of this group, to share 
effective teaching strategies, and to be 
aware of the resources on campus, 
said Ko.
People who interact with Carnegie 
Mellon freshmen in different capaci
ties are encouraged to share their 
ideas and experiences with any of the 
council members, said Ko. We are 
also interested in learning about ef
fective first-year programs at other 
universities, said Ko. Needless to 
say, we would like to hear from our 
students, both freshmen and upper
classmen.
The council plans to present its first 
set of recommendations for improvement 
by May, as part of the University Strate
gic Planning Process. Council member 
John Woolford, professor of biological 
sciences, said, I am hoping that we will 
be able to implement changes to really 
improve the first year experience and 
the ability of the students to assimilate 
into college.
Student artists show work in UC Gallery

Jason Siegendorf /Tartan Photo Staff Manager
Megan Day is this weeks featured student artist in the UC Gallery. She 
collaborated on this display with her brother, David.
By DANIELLE PIERATTI
Tartan Staffwriter
It began as an idea that I wanted to 
do an exhibit with my brother because 
hes influenced me since I was young, 
and theres a lot of similarities in our 
work even though we have distinct 
styles, said Megan Day, this weeks 
contributing artist to the new Univer
sity Center Gallery. She went on to 
explain how the choice to do land
scapes rather than portraits was an 
important one because it defined a 
link between her and her brother, 
David Day, whose art is also presently 
being shown in the gallery. Theres a 
conversation that goes on between our 
work because we talk so much and we 
play off certain things with each other. 
Thats what inspired me to do the 
show, because my relationship with 
my brother is very important to me, 
said Day.
At the same time, the selection of 
an exhibit of landscapes rather than 
a more specific portrayal of the sib
lings relationship, such as portraits, 
was also something that viewers could 
relate to. Ive found that painting 
the subject of a landscape is a very 
different experience than painting 
objects or people. When painting a 
person, I have a specific relationship 
with that person that is the central 
focus of the piece.... With landscapes, 
I have a very different relationship to 
the subject. The subject is open, and I 
am dealing with objects as they exist 
only with their relationship to a 
space.... The experience of painting a 
landscape is very different because 
youre representing the space as well 
as the object. I like the idea of paint
ing spaces that you can draw people 
into, said Day.
However, in spite of her apparent 
knowledge on the subject of landscapes, 
Megan admits that she is quite new to 
the subject. Dealing with the idea of 
landscape was a new experience for
me this semester.... My brother has 
been painting landscapes since he was 
a senior in high school, and has a 
stronger foundation for dealing with 
the representation of space, she said.
There are galleries on campus but 
none that have been like this, said 
Anne Witchner, assistant dean of Stu
dent Affairs and director of Student 
Activities. This is due to the fact that 
the gallery is unique in two ways: it is 
at the center of campus, in a highly 
traversed area, and it is the only gal
lery which displays the work of any 
students interested, whether or not 
they are art students. I think its a 
nice way to celebrate students ... who 
arent necessarily art majors, said 
Witchner.
Heather Midkiff, the gallerys main 
organizer, sees the gallery as a valu
able source of information, both for 
contributors and viewers. I think the 
gallery serves as both an educational 
programming resource, and an oppor
tunity for students to gain experience 
setting up shows, she said.
In affirmation of this, Black History 
month will be celebrated by a display 
of the African American Quilters Guild 
from February 3-7, and artwork by 
Pittsburgh children on what Black 
History month means to them, dis
played by individuals from East End 
Tutoring and CMU Role Models from 
February 17-28.
This semester, the gallery will be 
run by Tolga Ehran, a graduate stu
dent in GSIA. Getting in touch with 
art is something everyone must ex
perience in his or her life, said Tolga. 
Contributors will include: Christo
pher Craychee, CMU design stu
dents, Photo Club, Rachel 
Schmeidler, Edith Pong and the Hong 
Kong Students Association, Aimee 
Sealfon, Jesse Ramey, and Karen 
Liebowitz. Megan Days closing re
ception will be held on Friday Janu
ary 24 from 79 pm in the gallery for 
anyone who is interested.
Psychology department receives prestigious research funding

bringing in elementary school 
science teachers as consultants 
for the project. The grants were 
given after 60 institutions sub
mitted proposals describing the 
instructional problem, relevant 
cognitive research, the proposed 
method of intervention, and bud
getary information.
Klahr, his research assistant 
Jennifer Schnakenberg, a gradu
ate in Psychology from the Uni
versity of Pittsburgh, and Chen, 
have been investigating the sci
ence reasoning abilities of chil
dren, with a focus on the Control 
of Variables Strategy, or con
cept of designing experiments 
that compare situations that dif
fer in one variable while all other 
variables remain constant.
Assessment tests indicate that 
children are variably poor in us
ing the control strategy which is 
why we need to improve their 
skills. It is not beyond them to 
learn this concept. With training 
they are able to understand, said 
Chen.
Our main goal is to design 
the best method for teaching 
scientific reasoning skills in 
classrooms so students can ap
ply this type of skill in various 
situations. The intent is to ulti
mately incorporate a set of sci
ence reasoning material into the
elementary school curriculum, 
he added.
This study examines a childs 
skill at scientific reasoning by 
conducting both lab-based stud
ies as well as classroom studies. 
According to Schnakenberg, labbased studies involve a pre-test 
assessing the childs reasoning 
skills without any prior instruc
tion, followed by a brief training 
session on the material and then 
a post-test. Classroom-based 
studies involve science reason
ing instruction using material de
signed in collaboration with area 
science teachers.
Three different groups of chil
dren are used in the study. In one 
group, children take a pre-test, 
get trained in the subject matter, 
and then take a post-test. In the 
second group, children engage in 
different tasks but never get 
training. In the last group, chil
dren are not asked any questions 
and the main intent is to see if 
simply manipulating the vari
ables helps them learn. However, 
according to Schnakenberg, this 
method has proven to be the least 
successful.
Schnakenberg has been test
ing the scientific reasoning skills 
of children in grades K-5 since 
the beginning of last year, al
though she said the actual ma

terial will probably be designed 
for third and fourth graders. The 
tasks involve comparing the 
speed of a ball down a ramp 
with a smooth surface versus a 
rough surface, examining how 
fast objects sink in water de
pending upon various factors, 
and testing the effect of four 
weights on springs of varying 
dimensions.
Different grade levels are cho
sen within the schools and per
mission letters are sent to the 
parents of these children. 
Schnakenberg said the response 
she has received has been fairly 
positive. Generally about 50 
percent of the parents allow
their children to participate, and 
at the two participating schools, 
the science teachers have been 
very supportive. The kids are 
finding the tasks pretty inter
esting too, she said. One factor 
that may influence this figure if 
the fact that sessions are con
ducted during class time and 
often after school.
The other five institutions to 
receive research grants from the 
Foundation were Edinburgh Uni* 
versity in the United Kingdom, 
Georgia Institute of Technolog)'

Columnist ponders communication
The Players Manual
by Amit N. Kar
Right. Lets start with one of the ba
sics: communication. In college, in ca
reers, in life, the ability to effectively 
communicate a thought is one of the 
most important skills a person can de
velop. It strikes me as odd that so few 
people actually grasp the full impor
tance of this. Example:
Sometime in the mid-50s, two huge 
ships plying the North Atlantic  one 
freighter, the other a luxury liner  
found themselves steaming directly at 
one another. Sensing that something 
not-so-nice would happen if the situa
tion was left to be, the two captains 
spoke briefly and decided one vessel 
would turn right and the other left. As 
result, something not so nice hap
pened: the liner went down, taking 
hundreds of passengers with it, and 
the freighter limped into New 
York, minus bow and listing 
severely, after rescuing what 
remained of the liners comple
ment. See, if you and I are fac
ing each other, your right is my 
left so if you turn right and I 
turn left, were going to smack 
into each other. (Du-uh!) While 
this is a wonderful way to meet 
new people or test the efficacy 
of your pheremone-based co
logne, its not a particularly 
great way to maneuver several 
hundred thousand tons of 
ocean-going metal.
The example is, of course, an 
extreme one, but the error at its 
root is a fundamental one that 
plagues this school: hearing but 
not listening, failure to com
municate. And Im not talking 
about acknowledging the dif
ference between listening and 
hearing; Im talking about
conciously making the decision to lis
ten, choosing to communicate.
In an environment such as ours, its 
easy to develop a lazy attitude to listen
ing. When you spend most of your time 
strapped into a chair, plugged into head
phones, and glued to a monitor while 
pouring over a problem set, and the rest 
of your time snoring and drooling in 
class, its easy for the little audio-recep
tors in our heads to say, Oh well, I 
guess thats it then. My useful life is 
over. Ill just go die in this unused 
corner of my masters head. Oh! My 
long-lost friend, sexual drive!
CMU students have suffered in the 
work environment because their com
munication skills are not cultivated. 
A corporate recruiter at last 
semesters BOC mentioned that CMU 
has a reputation of turning out gradu
ates who excel in their field, but who 
suffer in a team situation because of 
under-developed people skills. A 
CMU professor is known for saying 
GSIAs refusal to take the warm, 
fuzzy, group-hug approach to man
agement taken by Harvard and Yale 
is a reason to be proud. Yale and 
Harvard graduates have been 
societys leaders because they culti
vate communication skills  the 
group-hug works for them.
While strong academics is mostly re
sponsible for getting the new graduates 
foot in the career door, advancement is 
based on other factors: commitment, a 
nice smell, an extensive arsenal of stu
pid party tricks, and the ability to inter
act at all levels with an increasingly 
diverse, international work-force. Leav
ing such an important part of personal 
development to sometime after gradua
tion would serve only to retard growth in 
career, society, and in life. Indeed, col
lege is the ideal place  where else are 
you going to find yourself in the midst of 
so many quacks, nuts, freaks, and loopies 
who will disagree with you on every 
possible issue?
So, take more discussion classes, join 
a student organization that deals with 
something that matters, strike up a con
versation with a member of the custo
dial staff when you find yourselves in an 
elevator together, take a professor out to 
lunch and find out what went wrong. 
Talk and listen as much as possible  
its actually a great deal of fun.
Amit is apoopy-head and doesn't think 
there is anything wrong with this. As a 
matter of fact, he knows there are more 
poopy-heads out there and he thinks yoi 
should all just stand up and claim your 
proud heritage.

The Millennium approaches ...
Dean talks about book
By BECKY A- COWSER
Tartan Features Editor
When I was in grade school, I real
ized that I would possibly be living to 
see a new century. This excited me, 
said Peter Stearns, dean of the College 
of Humanities and Social Sciences 
(H&SS). Last Sunday he held a book 
reading and signing at Barnes & Noble 
in Squirrel Hill for his new publica
tion, Millennium III: Century XXI.
The notion of living [to see 
the beginning of a period] is 
like watching a speedometer
 living to see the numbers 
roll over is exciting, he said.
Steams new book deals with 
the fact that we are rapidly ap
proaching not only a new cen
tury, but also a new millen
nium and the attitudes that ac
company such a monumentous 
occasion. The book is an effort 
to cover all the issues I could 
think of [that were] associated 
with providing some perspec
tive on covering the millen
nium, he said. Weve only had 
one before, and there is a wide
spread belief that when it oc
curred, [many Christians be
lieved] the end of the world was 
expected. It turns out this is 
largely, if not entirely, wrong.
The issue of possible media 
exploitation of the millennium 
is also discussed in Steams 
book. For us it leaves a few questions: 
number one, which is better, a good 
story or the truth? And number two, 
how much anxiety will be focused on 
this millennium? How many people 
and what kinds of people believe this is 
a countdown to the end of the world? 
Im interested in the many groups that 
retain an interest in seeing the upcom
ing millennium as a probable time of 
despair and destruction.
When asked where he thinks the great
est number of people who actually be
lieve that the year 2000 signals an end 
to civilization as we knowithve, Steams 
replied, Thats hard to calculate. It does 
look like there are more millennium 
groups in the United States than else
where, [especially] in California.
Stearns stressed that although the 
advent of a new millennium is impor
tant, people tend to look more towar.d 
the new century as a standard time 
reference. In his book, he discusse.s 
peoples attitudes toward the fin de sieclp 
of the nineteenth century and what they 
can tell us about current attitudes to
ward the end of the twentieth century.
I try to talk about how predictions 
can be assessed and what kinds of

Peter Stearns, dean of H&SS read from his new 
book at Barnes & Noble Bookstore last Sunday.
historical motives underlie different pre
dictions, saidSteams. One ofthe things 
that will happen is that there will be 
assessments ofthe twentieth century. It 
will be interesting to see how much 
change and how much continuity there 
is from the assessment made at the end 
of the nineteenth century.
When looking at the optimistic reflec
tions of end of the century editorials in the 
1900s, Steams said that he doesnt think 
such a positive look back is probable at the 
end of this century. From my vantage 
point as a historian, its really hard to look 
back and say, Boy was this [century] 
great! Boy are we on the crest of progress! 
Our commentary for the twenty-first cen
tury ... might be a lot more guarded.

Students may certainly protest, 
with the only consideration that 
they not impede the business of 
other members of the commu
nity or violate university poli
cies. We have never had a pro
test in which there was any such 
violation of other members of 
the community, he said.
Though the University does 
not cancel classes on this day, 
Dean Murphy feels this fact 
should not undermine the im
portance of the holiday for any
one. He said, Martin Luther 
King Day is obviously a very 
important day for the nation 
and for the University. I cer
tainly understand why some 
people feel cancelling classes on 
this day would be a good idea, 
but I can assure you that the 
rationale behind not closing is 
not in any way a failure to rec
ognize the importance of the day 
or of this great man and what he 
stands for. As a diverse interna
tional community, we have 
many days of celebration shared 
by faculty, staff, and students. 
Many national and religious 
holidays are not celebrated by 
the cancellation of classes, but 
they are still clearly important 
to us. Martin Luther King Day, 
ospecially, has always been a 
time when we gather as a com
munity in celebration.
While students and faculty 
remain in class on Monday, a 
dumber of programs have been 
scheduled to take place on camPus in observation of the holi
day. A Community Tribute is 
being held at 4:30 pm in the 
Adamson Wing. This ceremony 
include introductions by 
Everett Tademy, a welcoming 
sPeech by William Elliot, vice 
President for Enrollment, a talk 
conducted by the Reverend Doc
tor Harold T. Lewis, a perfor
mance by the Voices United Gos
pel Choir, as well as presenta
tions by students. An open cam
pus reception will be held fol
lowing the program. It is being 
co-sponsored by the Associate 
Provost, the Black Faculty and 
Staff Association, the Black 
Graduate Student Organiza
tion, the Carnegie Mellon Ac
tion Project, the School of Hu
manities and Social Sciences, 
the Heinz School, the Office of 
the President, Student Life, 
SPIRIT, Student Activities, Stu
dent Affairs, and the Voices 
United Gospel Choir.
Despite the Universitys at
tempt to honor King, some feel 
that these services are not ad
equate commemoration of the 
leaders beliefs. Because the 
on-campus ceremonies that 
CMU has planned do not pro
vide students with much of an 
opportunity to become involved 
in larger community struggles, 
I can only conclude that CMU 
does not really respect Dr. 
Kings legacy, Woller said. It 
likewise seems to me that the 
CMU schedule discourages us 
from recognizing that there 
might be aspects of our lives, 
such as community activism, 
which are not quite either work 
or play. I guess that is why the 
schedule includes days on for 
work, and days off for midterm 
break, for spring carnival, and 
for spring break, but not for the 
King holiday.
The Universitys action has 
invoked similar feelings in 
many faculty, staff and stu
dents. Linville said, I think 
that to become a more positive 
presence for the Pittsburgh 
community, this school needs 
to see that it cannot remain 
aloof from the struggles waged 
by African-Americans for jus
tice everyday all around it.

CMU Students Brave Chilly
Weattier for downhill Fun
julee White/Tartan Art Editai;
ih University.]
Its winter again, the time of 
when the ground freezes and the activi
ties dry up. And being college students,
were generally broke. Sounds like theres j:%dtnfere).
O00-o
n of traying carries on.
nothing to do, right?
Wrong. Theres an inexpensive way to 
have fun outside, and it takes no skill or 
brains to pull it off. Its called traying or 
sliding, where you take a makeshift sled 
and throw yourself down hills for thrills. 
The most popular form is traying, where 
you take a tray from one of the dining 
services and attempt to slide down hills. 
Traying is so popular now that Dining 
Services notices a marked increase in 
tray disappearances during winter, but 
are completely unaware that they are 
being used as sleds by the student body.
The best places around campus for 
traying and the like are the hills around
Schenley park, specially Flagstaff Hill 
and Scobell Hili. But, according to David 
Wingrove, junior logic and computation 
major, Itd be better if CMU had a 
steeper hill. Oh well, you can always 
explore the area for bigger and better 
hills. Besides, it couldnt hurt to get
----, from campus for a few hours and
of the city (yes, there is a city 
____).
For the real thrills, trays dont always 
cut it. The trays didnt work, so we got 
garbage bags for Scobell hill, says Sam 
Hoffman, sophomore mechanical engi
neering major. Most students who have 
tried traying and sliding on garbage 
bags agree that the garbage bags work 
much better. The trays are flimsy and 
hardly frictionless, and overall, accord
ing to Winter Mason, junior creative 
writing major, Theyre not very good 
sleds, garbage bags work better, but its 
fun to steal from CMU. The method of 
sliding you use would then depend on 
whether you prefer the thrill of flying 
down hills or the thrill of heisting cheap 
plastic trays from your alma mater.
There are several methods of garbage 
bag sliding. You can climb in feet first
and slide down. For this method, you 
can cut out holes for your feet, giving the 
garbage bag an underwear feel. You can 
ride on top of the whole thing and hope 
that a slight bump or divot doesnt buck 
you off. And then theres the method 
used by only the bravest (or craziest) of 
sliders, where you throw the bag over 
your head and hope you dont run into 
anything solid.
But there are also a few dangers in 
traying or sliding, as Rich Svinkin, jun
ior history and policy double major points 
out, Never, ever tray down a hill unless 
you know what you are doing, and know 
that the pond at the bottom is frozen. 
Half frozen ponds are only the begin
ning. Some of the most popular traying 
runs have some nasty surprises along 
their way. Trees are an ever-present 
danger, but also spice up an otherwise 
dull run. One the best hills near campus, 
on the Schenley golf course, finishes by, 
dumping you out in the street if you 
dont stop before then.
If you go traying or sliding and find 
that it doesnt strike your fancy, you can1 
always have a snowball fight, or build a 
snowman, or do some other silly snow 
activity. But try traying at least once in 
you academic career; you might find you 
like it, especially since its free.

Hewlett exhibit manipulates 
common images of women
By BECCA FRIBUSH
Tartan Staffwriter
The manipulated photographic imTes of Cara Jayes one-woman art 
how, Flying against the Ceiling, at
photographed wearing paper wings, 
which makes sense in relation to her 
goal of bringing dignity to the nude 
female figure. The concept of ascent is 
continued in the photographs where 
Jaye has transferred to tiles and sustJhe Hewlett Gallery in the College of pended from the ceilingpictures
pine Arts, clearly have a lot of thought 
behind them. Just as clearly, theyre 
the work of a skilled artist and photog
rapher. Desirable as these character
istics are, Jaye cant quite overcome 
her use of cliched imagery to create a 
completely satisfy
ing exhibit.
Jayes repetoire 
Consists of images of 
Ititchen sinks,
^jrings, and women 
ijoth dressed and 
ndressed. Most of 
er photographs are 
printed on cloth 
splattered with 
strategically placed 
stains. Also recur
ring in her work are 
women cleaning up 
the stains. In Jayes 
view, this collection 
6f images speaks to 
tjhe concept of how 
^omen are por
trayed in both art 
ndin society. More 
specifically, the 
stains bring to mind 
he traditionally 
eld view of women as cleaners rather 
than creators. For the female, she 
says in her artists statement, stains 
evoke embarrassment and shame, and 
it is the womans job to remove stains.
Likewise, the nude female body is 
commonly seen as cause for embar
rassment and manipulation. By focus

which are literally flying against the 
ceiling.
Many of Jayes images, including 
pictures of sinks so clear and sharp 
that one can read the fine print on the 
bottles of Woolite or Joy and a brown 
and red stained pic
ture of a headless 
winged statue, are 
striking on their 
own, but for a con
ceptual show like 
this one, success de
pends more on the 
strength of the over
all idea behind the 
exhibit than on the 
merits of the indi
vidual works. By 
this criteria, the 
concept has some 
weak points.
Not that the 
shows intellectual 
framework is a com
plete washoutfar 
from it. Reading the 
artists statement, 
in which Jaye ex
plains the thought 
behind the imagery, 
allows the viewer to appreciate a co
herence and depth not easily apparent 
from the images alone. Yet the central 
conceit of tying together stains, 
womens nude bodies, and wings seems 
contrived. The main images of Jayes 
work seem tired and unoriginal. After 
all, exactly how many thousands of 
times have wings been used as a symCourtesy Hewlett Gallery
Cara Jaye uses unusual materials to 
change perceptions of women in art.
Jaye hopes to cleanse perceptions of bol of uplift. The wings and the stains

For Jaye, the wings are a personal 
metaphor for individual achievement 
in any one of a number of different 
arenas. While hardly unique as a sym

tively, but this has been shown by 
many artists before her. Yet Jayes

with a way to present her theme just 
as eloquently using fresher or more 
surprising imagery.
The Relic provides thrills
Punk compilations easy on the wallet
By BRADLEY W. ZIMMERMAN
Tartan Staffwriter
When looking for new music, used 
CD stores rarely solve your problems. 
You always run the risk of wasting 
your eight bucks on something that 
doesnt float your boat or is completely 
derivative of everything else in your 
collection. Considering the current 
carbon-copy state of punk, the odds 
look even worse for the discriminat
ing punter whos just spent the day 
freezing his tuckus off begging out
side the Beehive. Well, suffer no more, 
ye of little love for alternative radio, 
welcome to the land of compilation 
discs. Three of the most popular 
labels for roots ruckus have recently 
released extensive sampler CDs for 
the short of cash flow.
Who: Various Artists 
What: Punk-O-Rama Vol.2 
Label: Epitaph Records
<S| Who: Various Artists 
hl What: Survival of the Fattest 
rh Label: Fat Wreck Chords
Who: Various Artists 
What: Heide Sez 
Label: Lookout! Records
Probably the most lucrative label, 
Epitaph (run by ex-Bad Religion gui
tarist Brett Guerewitz), offers up its 
second installment of showcase tal
ent, Punk-O-Rama Vol. 2. Epitaph 
has always carried the biggest names, 
particularly Rancid, Pennywise, 
NOFX, and the Bad Religion back 
catalog, but the biggest news is their 
signing of the newly reformed Descendents, New Bomb Turks, and Cali
fornia legends TSOL.
The label is known for championing 
the hard-hitting speed-based South
ern California skate style of punk, 
and the disc kicks off with the 
caffeinated Coffee Mug by the Descendents, and later brings back 
TSOLs infamous ode to necrophilia, 
Code Blue. Still, the focus of PunkO-Rama Vol.2 is to give mass-exposure to the newer bands like Pulley 
and Millencolin, whose fabulously 
breakneck melody makes their track
Bullion a shining beacon for the fu
ture of the label. The greatest gem 
among the bunch is the Mudhoney/ 
SNFU side project Me First and the 
Gimme Gimmes and their hilarious pithappy cover of the Billy Joel torch song 
Only the Good Die Young. You get all 
this and heaven too for around four 
dollars....
The sound of punk was founded on 
bringing back the simplicity of 50s rock 
and roll during the pretentious wank of 
the bloated 70s arena rock landscape, 
and Lookout! Records may well be the 
last stronghold of true punk. Heide 
Sez contains 26 tracks which jump from 
lounge, to surf, to goony Sha-Na-Na 
antics. Sweet Baby are the consum
mate Beatles-on-ephidrine, with 
group harmonies and an abandon that 
seems to come right out of the movie 
Backbeat. Queer-core 
champions Pansy Division 
bring a camp-fire singalong style that is almost 
as cute as the sugar shock 
of Cubs Magic Eight 
Ball, an ode to 
everybodys favorite infal
lible fortune teller. Spot
light darlings such as the 
ska beat of Citizen Fish 
and the manly crunch of 
Avail share space with a 
unfathomable glut of 
bouncy boy-meets-girland-yearns tunes which 
strangely dont seem out 
of place next to a childish 
send-up by the Phantom 
Surfers. For less than 
twelve dollars, Heide Sez 
scores with diversity, flatout fan, and well, 26 songs.
Finally, theres Survival of the Fat
test from Fat Wreck Chords. Run by Fat 
Mike from NOFX, this label has con
stantly been bashed for all its bands 
sounding like well, NOFX. True, you 
hear plenty of the NOFX guitar tone 
(edgy as all get-out) but the bands are 
amazingly discemable from each other, 
and NOFX themselves turn in one of 
the weaker tracks. The infamous hu
mor is rife on Survival, from strange 
out-of-left-field tempo changes to the 
frank rejection conversation in Diesel 
Boys Titty Twister. The best political
band still around, Propagandhi (who 
always sounded a bit like NOFX to 
begin with,) let fly with their most 
valuable Scrabble words in Nation 
States, while Wizo makes the most of 
their ignorance of the English lan
guage by performing a kick-ass Oil
iest, Raum der Zeit, completely in 
their native German. Oh, and Me First 
and the Gimme Gimmes make an
other appearance, this time destroy
ing that old hick hoe-down Country 
Roads. Is there stuff that sucks dookie 
on Survival of the Fattest? Sure, but at 
least they were nice enough to tag the 
CD with a note that says DONT PAY 
MORE THAN $4.
All three of the compilations are worth 
their punk points, so it comes down to 
tastes. Do you want to stick with the 
familiar? Grab Epitaph! sPunk-O-Rama
Courtesy Lookout! Records 
Heidi Sez compilation provides listeners with 26 
diverse tracks for a small price.
Vol.2. If you like your punk poppy and 
light-hearted, Heide Sez is your best 
bet. Survival of the Fattest is more or 
less for those looking for fast and me
lodic new school stuff. Still, the purpose 
of compilations is to entice you to buy 
more from the label, which is a capital
ist scheme, so if you buy these youre a 
sell-out tool, you goddamn poser. Go 
listen to Green Day.
By the way, if you took that seri
ously, youre an idiot and missing out 
on some damn good music. Rock forth, 
me brethern, Johnny Rotten wont 
hate you....

rifying creature which when con
jured, will destroy your enemies. 
But is it only a myth?
In The Relic, Margo Green 
(Penelope Ann Miller, Carlitos 
y/ay, The Shadow) is an evolu
tionary biologist working at the 
Natural History Museum in Chi
cago. After a series of murders, 
police Lieutenant Vincent 
PAgosta (Tom Sizemore, Natu
ral Born Killers, Heat) begins to 
find that the murderer may not 
be human.
The film did what I hoped it 
^ould do  it scared me. Sure, 
Im not going to have nightmares 
from it, but the thrill was there, 
2nd I jumped on cue, just as the 
rest of the audience seemed to 
respond. Director Peter Hyams 
{2010, The Presidio) followed the 
Alien approach to suspense  
dont show you much, and let the 
anxiety build.
However, when the creature 
^as finally shown, it was one so 
hideous, that you know had you 
encountered it, you wouldnt 
Stand a chance. This film is gory. 
Not necessarily like a slasher 
film, but it comes close some
times. The Kothoga kills people 
^ ripping off their heads, and 
bating part of their brain (the 
reason for which is explained in 
the movie). DAgosta does not
want the museum to host its gala 
opening for the Superstition Ex
hibit, since the murderer had not 
been caught. But, the Mayor (who 
will be in attendance) would be 
upset if it werent to occur. So, 
the gala must go on. Good idea? 
Bad idea.
This spells lunch for the 
Kothoga! The brutal attacks are 
skillfully accomplished through 
the clever mix of editing, Stan 
Winston Studios animatronics, 
and VIFXs computer graphics. 
Isnt it great when you can watch 
a man run towards the camera 
while being chasedby the Kothoga, 
get caught, and watch his head 
being ripped off  in one take? It 
may be the sick side of me that 
loves stuff like that, but the movie 
isnt all like that. There are quiet 
moments which have a bit of mys
tery to them - how did the Kothoga 
come to be? That is what Margo 
must find out.
Ill be honestthe acting is not 
great. Penelope Ann Miller, while 
aveiy talented actress, cannothold 
the audience by looking scared, or 
using her computer to access the. 
internet. Tom Sizemore, looking 
like George Clooney, is too softspoken to be a lieutenant in charge 
of a murder investigation. But it is 
the Kothoga that steals the show. 
A creature which is composed ge
netically of different species, it is 
repulsive to look at, yet I found 
myself wanting to see more of it. I 
find myself continually impressed 
with the new applications of com
puter graphics in the movies nowa
days. Everyone has seen Jurassic 
Park, it seems, and with The Lost 
World: Jurassic Park coming this 
May, there wont be a shortage of 
dinosaurs. But since the Kothoga 
is composed of different species, it 
is harder to work with than a dino
saur (if you take my meaning).
The finale, which certainly kept 
the adrenaline pumping, is worth 
the price of admission (at a mati
nee). But you might as well go 
ahead and enjoy the film as well 
because we all like to be scared.

If Monorchid, Jumbo, and

indie rock fan or you happened

Award winning foreign films arrive at theaters and stores around Pittsburgh

-, This new year is a very promis
ing one with respect to new mov
ies. In fact, a couple of treasures 
have already opened in Pitts
burgh, including Breaking the 
Waves, the new movie by Lars 
von Trier that won the Grand 
Prize at Cannes Film Festival 
ifcst year. Also worthy of men
tion, the latest from Manoel de 
pliveira hit video, and the 
Carnegie Museum of Art just 
started this winters Latin Ameri
can series.
breaking the Waves
When one thinks of a von Trier 
movie, elaborate convolutions of 
writing and photography come 
o mind. In Zentropa, he mingled 
.Weimar cinema references and
World War Two-movie charac
ters with post-modern style. 
More recently, in The Kingdom, 
the beloved genre of medical 
drama was driven all the way to 
the supernatural.
In Breaking the 
Waves he seems to 
have stepped 
back a bit from 
stylistic mischief 
to concentrate in 
this beautiful and 
deeply religious 
story.
The film is the I 
story of Bess 
(Emily Watson in an astonish
ing performance). She lives in a 
small Puritan village on the shore 
of Scotland. Over the reproaches 
ofthe town elders, she marries a 
handsome oil rig worker from 
out of town. Overcome by feel
ings she is told to hide, she gives 
way to happiness. That is until 
her husband is paralyzed in an 
accident and asks her to take 
lovers and then to come back and
...[Breaking the Waves] will 
move you and perhaps give 
you hope, even though it might 
break your heart/'
tell him about it, a Scherezade to 
keep him alive. His wish becomes 
for her a calvary, and Bess be
comes a saint through this per
verse sexuality and shows ev
eryone what true devotion is. As 
I said, it is a religious story, but
not one about the institution of 
the church, but about the real 
faith that lies in Bess.
Breaking the Waves looks gor
geous without elaboration or pre
fabricated lighting. 
The entire movie is 
shot handheld, and I 
dont think Robby 
Mueller had done this 
much handheld since 
the Wenders days. The 
immediacy of the im
ages lets you feel with
_______ the characters but at
M the same time realize 
that Bess faith may 
be impossible to attain by the 
rest of us. In short, this is a true 
masterpiece of a movie that I 
urge you to go see. It is not ma
nipulative cinema like the kind 
we are so used to here; but never
theless it will move you and per
haps give you hope, even though 
it might break your heart. 
Shakespeare and the Devil in 
Portugal 
New on video is 1995s The Con
vent, Manoel de Oliveiras strange 
fable set in a monastery in Portu
gal. The film, beautifully shot and 
edited, has a perhaps indescrib
able quality through the actors 
gestures, and through the writing 
itself. However silly this may 
sound, the movie is like an X-files 
episode directed by Antonioni. 
John Malkovich plays an English 
professor bent on proving that 
Shakespeare was really a Span
iard. To do so he visits a remote 
monastery in Portugal with his 
wife (Catherine Deneuve) in hope 
of finding a revelatory document. 
Soon the story turns into a spiri
tual parable, a lethargic wrestling 
with the devil set in the remnants
of paradise (which happens to be 
pretty close to the entrance ofhelTjv 
Strange and hypnotizing, The Conx 
vent is indeed a rare gem.
Other stuff...
This winter, the Carnegie Mu
seum of Art brings us two interna
tional series: Asian cinema and 
Latin American cinema. The first 
series includes the trendy crime 
story Chunking Express. Over in' 
the Latin American series is i 
premiere ofEliseo Subielas Dark 
Side of the Heart. This one looks 
like another great fable in the style 
of his Man Facing Southeast so I 
blindly recommend it.
Breaking the Waves is playing 
at the Harris theater through, 
January 30. Dark Side of the! 
Heart will play this weekend onl$ 
at the Carnegie. All other movies' 
mentioned are available on video.

Blue Velvet
This ones about a helicopter and love. It begins 
with a young man (Kyle MacLachlan) porking 
Isabella Rosellini. And of course, who wouldnt? It 
goes on to star a young Dean Stockwell and Den
nis Hopper and his knife.
Featuring the directing talents of David Lynch, 
this one is chock full of all the things that make 
good drama: descant, leitmotif, nitrous oxide, 
somebodys ear, monosodium glutamate, and a 
gripping climax. The helicopter plays a subtle, 
but vital role as Isabella Rosellinis estranged 
husband and guru. A cult classic, this film is best 
enjoyed with a cold beer and a manic depressive 
attitude.

The Island of Dr. Moreau
Actually, this movie is not so much about his 
island as it is about the body of water separating 
it from the mainland. Such a body of water is 
usually referred to as a sound  but a geographi
cal term used mainly by readers of Tom Clancy 
books.
Starring the evergreen Marlon Brando, who 
excels in his role as the island, this movie ex
plores the theme of genetic experimentation and 
cellulite removal as dealt with in H.G. Wells 
novel, The Island of Lost Souls. Brando is large 
and his every movement causes the palms on this 
picturesque island to lilt and sway with abrupt 
beauty. A modem classic, this movie is best en
joyed with dark sunglasses and Goldschlager.

Die Hard
Although Bruce Willis has proven himself in the 
boxing ring during the Thrilla in Manila, fans 
werent too sure about his acting ability. But he 
laid all doubts to rest in this thought-provoking 
love story adapted from a short story by 
Dostoevsky. Willis plays a New York police officer 
transported to the magical world of Los Angeles, 
where he finds himself in the midst of a grave 
emotional struggle.
We follow Willis through an escalating series of 
internal turmoils as he learns that transcendence 
of death can only be found in the Marxist dialectic 
and not in the fantasy world of organized religion. 
And there are also some terrorists holding a large 
building hostage. And Willis has to kick their 
respective asses, in turn, one after the other.
Theres this thing in the movie that is really 
neat. Youll just have to go see it.

Writer speaks out about Larry Flynt
By GREG MARCKS
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Woody Harrelson as Larry 
Flynt says to a prosecutor, If 
you dont like Hustler magazine, 
dont read it. Whether or not you 
read Hustler magazine, if you 
like the First Amendment, watch 
The People vs. Larry Flynt.
f
What: The People vs. 
Larry Flynt 
Director: Milos Forman 
Company: Columbia
This movie is not about naked 
women, although a number of 
them do appear in the film. It is 
about a smut publisher/born 
rebel who is continually in trouble 
with the law. As the title indi
cates, The People vs. Larry Flynt 
is essentially a courtroom drama, 
beginning in a Cincinnati court
house and ending in the Supreme 
Court.
This movies central message 
is that freedom of expression in 
the United States of America 
should be protected at all costs. 
Anyone who has ever believed in 
protecting this right will marvel 
at the extreme ways in which 
this man exercises it. Yet even
those who despise pornography 
and Larry Flynt himself will be 
able to enjoy this film, by identi
fying with the principle of free 
expression and by empathizing 
with him in his love for his 
wife and his friendship with his 
lawyer.
Larry Flynts life is a fascinat
ing one. To be told in two hours, 
much was left 
out, including 
a few details 
which seem 
rather impor
tant. For 
instance,
Larrys law
yer gets shot, 
but the next 
time we see 
him on screen 
he is fine.
Also, Larry 
suddenly has 
a speech im
pediment af
ter he returns from his opera
tion, but the cause is never di
rectly explained.
Woody Harrelson is a convinc
ing Larry Flynt and Courtney 
Love is more than convincing as 
his wife, Althea Leasure. Larrys 
attorney Alan Isaacman is per
formed well by Edward Norton, 
and Woodys real brother Brett 
plays Larrys brother Jimmy. 
Crispin Glover, looking much dif
ferent than George McFly in Back 
to the Future, plays one of Larrys 
assistants. Larry Flynt himself 
even makes a cameo appearance 
as (of all things) a closeminded 
judge. Other small roles are
1996 Columbia Pictures

pornography with his wife (Courtney Love).
played by Norm MacDonald, 
anchorperson for Weekend Up
date on Saturday Night Live, and 
James Cromwell, who played the 
farmer in Babe.
With a few notable exceptions, 
the direction is fairly standard. 
Director Milos Forman, best
known for One Flew Over the 
Cuckoos Nest and Amadeus, tells 
the story in. a straightforward, 
no-nonsense manner. Olive^ 
Stone, who directed Woody 
Harrelson in Natural Born Kill
ers, helped produce the film. 
The funniest moments are uridoubtedly the court scenes, ifi 
which Larry Flynts mockery c|f 
the judicial system serves par
tially as comic relief. Larrys T1- 
shirts alone are ample justifica
tion for seeing the film. Although 
The People vs. Larry Flynt does 
has many comic elements, it is 
ultimately a drama since one is 
constantly bombarded by the free 
speech message of this film.
Perhaps the films greatest flaw 
is that it relies on audience per
ceptions of the character and liffe 
of Larry Flynt as the only resfl 
opposition to its anti-censorship 
message. But since we are eifcouraged to identify with Larry, 
there is never any real question 
where the audiences sympathy 
should He. As a result, the real 
emotional climax of the film does 
not take place with the verdict in 
the courtroom but with the 
changing character of Larry him
self, and in this respect I think 
the film was a success.
Spinoff comic features familiar characters
Comic Book 
Chronicles
by Jason Andracki
Since Im starting anew in
1997, Ill be reviewing the new
est Vertigo book, The Books of 
Faerie, a three issue spin-off 
from Books of Magic. Once again 
Vertigo puts out, another great 
book. In my opinion they have 
yet to strike out, and Ive read 
at least one issue of just about 
every book from that imprint.
All the characters are famil
iar in this new book. Page one 
starts off with a scene from 
Books of Magic #13 in which 
Tim Hunter (BoMs protagonist) 
discovers his parents are not 
human but actually from the
land of Faerie. We see other 
familiar characters like Titania, Auberon, the Amadan, and 
others from the pages of Books 
of Magic and Sandman. This 
new book fits in neatly with the 
rest of the Neil Gaiman inspired 
books from Vertigo.
Following the flashback to 
Books of Magic, were taken 
back to the 11th century where 
a deprived child is taken to the 
land of Faerie. I wont tell you 
who the child grows up to be, 
but I will say this book is very 
important to the continuity of 
Books of Magic. Writer Browyn 
Carlton weaves a story that is 
deserving of the title fairy tale. 
The only other work of Carltons 
that Im familiar with is the Big 
Book of Death, but I hope shell 
be doing more work for Vertigo. 
She was obviously influenced 
by the masters of the fairy tale 
genre, the Brothers Grimm and 
Hans Christian Anderson. Its 
a shame that this book is la
beled Suggested for Mature

Falsettos tries to mix music with heavy topics
By JOHN BIGGS
Tartan Contributing Editor
Did you ever have Sea Mon
keys? Sure, we all did. They 
were interesting creatures that 
grew large by eating other, 
smaller Sea Monkeys. Now, stay 
with me. Im creating an alle
gory.
Falsettos, a musical written 
by William Finn (Guggenheim 
Fellowship winner in 
playwriting) and James Lapine 
(director and librettist for Pas
sion, Into the Woods, and Sun
day in the Park with George), is 
now playing at the Pittsburgh 
Public Theater. There is an 
overall aura about this musical 
comedy/opera that tends to cast 
a holy and powerful light on the 
very idea of performing it. While 
I was impressed that the play
ers were able to sing for so long,
I was nonplussed, overall.
Back to the Sea Monkeys: 
They sure are neat little crea
tures. Theyre just brine shrimp, 
but they have little eyes and 
thousands of cilia that propel 
them through their watery do
mains. Some are bigger and 
more impressive than others. 
Some are tiny and will soon be 
weeded out by natural selec
tion. But if you saw a jar of Sea 
Monkeys on the kitchen table, 
youd pour it out, right? As a 
population, they arent very in
teresting. They just look like a 
jar of dirty water.
Falsettos (actually made up 
of two musicals: March of the 
Falsettos and Falsettoland) is 
the story of Marvin (Dann Fink), 
his gay lover (Jay Montgomery), his son (Michael LaVolpe), 
his ex-wife (Maureen Silliman), 
and his ex-therapist (Scott 
Robertson) whom he stopped 
seeing after the therapist mar
ried his ex-wife.
Marvin doesnt know what he 
wants, which is fine  A prob
lem like that makes for good 
drama. The problem is, nobody 
knows what Marvin really
gets back together with his 
lover, who has a mysterious dis
ease (this was written in 1981). 
Finally, Marvins lover dies. 
And what do we know about 
Marvin in the end?
That he leads a pretty topsy
turvy life, kind of like Sea Mon
keys who spend their days spin
ning and swimming entertain
ingly but never really getting

wants, not even the audience, 
and even they never find out.
Marvin gets a divorce. Marvin 
moves in with his lover. Marvin 
isnt there for his son enough, 
and his ex-wife gets remarried. 
Marvin gets pretty upset and 
breaks up with his lover. 
Marvins son has a bar mitzvah. 
We are introduced to two lesbi
ans (Barbara Pflaumer and Bar
bara McCrane), one of whom

anywhere.
Taken individually, the forty 
or so songs that make up the 
musical are well wrought (each 
have their own little eyes and 
thousands of cilia). But put the 
population together and you just 
have a murky, muddled mess.
Falsettos wants to tell about 
the following problems (in or
der of seriousness): Jewish neu
roses, therapists, mother/father/son relations, homosexual
relationships, AIDS, and loveT. 
What is not clear is that Lapin'6 
and Finn wanted to say about 
these things. Think about it: 
Sure, Sea Monkeys are neat, 
but what are you supposed to do 
with them?
Fink, as Marvin, tries his best 
to portray the character as a 
confused middle-aged man torn 
between a family and a lover. 4 
veteran of the stage (Le$ 
Miserables) and silver screeii 
(Mighty Aphroditel
Cyber surfers), Fink looked and 
acted the part. However, the 
emotional intensity needed to 
explain why and how Marvin is 
in the predicament his is in is 
lacking. His level of intensity} 
however, is high and flat.
Marvins son, Jason, playec) 
by 12-year-old Michael LaVolpe} 
is an impressive find. He ha4 
good poise and was able to kee$ 
his place in a cast of six adults! 
His mother, played by Maureeii 
Silliman, was entertaining, as 
was her therapist-husband, a 
wry and witty Scott Robertson!
But it couldnt be saved. The 
trials of Marvin, while full oi* 
good pacing and wily lyrics' 
were just too murky to follow} 
Individually, each actor, song) 
and scene was a beautiful, jf 
tiny, creature. Put together', 
theres really nothing.
11Falsettos will be performing 
until February 16 at the Pitts{ 
burgh Public Theater. Ticket 
prices range from $15 to $34.50\ 
Discounted student tickets are 
available for most perform
