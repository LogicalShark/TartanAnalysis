Former sweatshop worker 
speaks out against GAP
by LAINE TOWEY
Tartan Staffwriter
Last Tuesday, Carmencita 
(Chie) Abad spoke to a large 
crowd in the Wright McKenna 
room about her experiences as. a 
worker in a GAP sweatshop. For 
six years, Abad worked on the 
island of Saipan, which is part 
of the Northern Mariana 
islands, a United States 
Commonwealth. The factory 
where she worked was part of 
the Sako Corporation, which is 
responsible for creating clothing 
for the GAP, as well as other 
major retailers such as Old 
Navy and Banana Republic.
Partially in response to Abads 
call to action against GAP 
sweatshops, protests were held 
by students on Walnut Street 
last Monday and Saturday.
Abad spoke about the condi
tions in the factory, as well as 
how the workers, who were 
mainly women, were coerced 
into sweatshop labor. Recruiters 
were in charge of getting mostly 
Asian women to. sign up for 
working in the factory, and they

Twenty-four , members of 
President Cohons Diversity 
Advisory Council have now been 
named and four more, including 
two students, have recently 
been invited. The council will 
consist of faculty, staff, stu
dents, trustees, and others out
side of the University. The 
newly developed council will 
hold its first meeting on 
Wednesday, November 24.
Everett Tademy, the director 
for Equal Opportunity Services 
and also the secretary for the 
advisory council, said that the 
first meeting Will mostly be comaccomplished this by telling the 
women that they would be work
ing in an American territory. In 
exchange for the opportunity to 
earn money, the women some
times had to give the recruiters 
up to seven thousand dollars for 
a work permit before they were 
permitted to go.
Another thing that the women 
had to do before leaving was to 
sign a contract, commonly
known as a shadow contract. 
In it, the workers agree that 
they will not join a labor organi
zation, will not complain about 
the treatment that they receive 
or the conditions that they work 
in, and will not fall in love, get 
married, or get pregnant. And 
once the women arrived at 
Saipan, they found that their 
new home was nothing like

posed of discussion about what 
has been done to promote diver
sity so far, recommendations 
from the diversity task force, 
and what the role of the council 
will be. They will also assess the 
current level of diversity at 
Carnegie Mellon and come up 
with their own definition of 
what diversity should mean to 
the campus.
This is not a one-time shot, 
said Tademy. We need to grow 
together continuously. In his 
Statement on Diversity, Cohon 
said, Our commitment to diver
sity is long-term. This is an 
institutional commitment now 
and until we become the univer
sity we envision.
Indira Nair, the vice provost 
for Education and Diversity 
Advisory Council (DAC) mem
ber, has a similar view. My 
greatest expectation is that the 
council will provide synergy 
between units now working on 
diversity within their own 
departments and organiza
tions.... Now we can do some
thing at all levels, including fac
ulty, staff, and students, she 
said. Nair also said that while 
several committees have been 
formed in the past, this is the 
first time the President has 
taken charge, and she hopes 
this would bring more unity to 
the issue.

CMU Health Services has 
recently encountered complaint 
reports concerning their ser
vices. According to a report by 
senior English major Terry 
Watt, there have been com
plaints due to mistreatments, 
and misdiagnosis. His report 
has prompted Student Senate < 
to investigate the status of the 
campus medical center.
We are investigating how 
widespread the student dis

Nick Fitzkee, chairman of 
Senates Campus Affairs 
Committee. In a recent meet

of Health Services Anita 
Barkin, and Dean of Student

The National Institute of 
Health has awarded Carnegie 
Mellon University and the 
University of Pittsburgh a fiveyear, $10 million grant to create 
a Center for the Study of MindBody Interactions and Health.
This grant will be used 
towards the research of four dif
ferent projects. Michael Scheier 
and Sheldon Cohen, psychology 
professors at Carnegie Mellon, 
will lead two of the projects 
studying how psychological fac
tors affect physical health. 
Karen Matthews, principal 
investigator for grant and 
director of the Mind-Body 
Center and Lynne Martire are 
leading the other two projects 
at the University of Pittsburgh.
The real focus of the grant is 
find out how psychological fac
tors get inside the body, and 
influence progressions to dis
ease, said Cohen. All four 
groups will focus on the same 
social and biological pathways 
and three hormones. For exam
ple, we will look at how stressed 
individuals are more likely to 
get sick due to the fact that they 
will smoke more and diet less. 
Cohen s group is focusing on 
how different marital statuses 
of an individual affect the com
mon influenza virus. We will 
be hoping to answer such ques
tions as, Are certain kinds of 
marriages harmful to health? 
and How important are differ
ent kinds of social domains 
(church groups, being 
employed, social circles, etc) to 
your health?  said Cohen.
The group already knows 
that there is a difference in 
health whether a person is 
married or unmarried. 
Conflicts in marriages yield 
psychological responses that 
are detrimental to health, said 
Cohen. We will conduct a care
ful evaluation of married and 
unmarried relationships and 
also check good versus bad 
marriages. 
Scheiers group is studying 
to see whether psychosocial 
interventions can be used 
to lower the chances of 
breast cancer. Matthews and 
her group are studying 
how psychological responses 
can be used to treat heart 
disease. Martires group is 
studying the effects on 
osteoarthritis patients.

Peter Burch wrote a biogra
phy for one of his assignments 
in an English class this semes
ter. The second paragraphs 
reads: After dropping out of 
Carnegie Mellon University in 
this senior year with three more 
classes to complete, Peter spent 
five years, four months, and 
twelve days as a professional 
house painter. Of course, 
Burch said, he was only joking.
Of course I plan to gradu
ate! he said, laughing. 
However, for many students, 
graduation at Carnegie Mellon 
is a choice they prefer to eschew.
At Carnegie Mellon, Burchs 
joke is more a reality and a con
cern than it is funny. While not 
all students who leave CMU 
become house painters, many of 
them do leave and transfer to 
other universities, or take time 
off. In other words, CMU has a 
high attrition rate compared to 
many other universities.

year use graduation and 
retention data to calcu
late their ranks. Last 
year, this factor account
ed for 20 percent of the 
final score for national 
institutions, suggesting 
that the high attrition 
rate at CMU has had a 
large bearing on its 
lower ranking.
The attrition rate in the 
late 1980s for all under
graduates was slightly 
above 25 percent. It 
peaked in 1980 at nearly 
30 percent.
Since then, it has 
dropped considerably. In 
the past four years the 
rate for undergraduate 
students was only slight
ly above 15 percent. Last 
year the attrition rate 
for the first-year class 
was 8.2 percent. From 
these statistics, the stu
dents who left CMU the 
most were AfricanAmericans, non-resident 
aliens, and students 
from MCS and H&SS.
However, despite a current low of 8.2 
percent, the attrition rate is still a con
cern because, according to Bill Elliot, 
vice president for enrollment, its an 
interesting subject. Although the 
administration and professors consis
tently work to improve the quality of 
education and student life at CMU, 
there is no current project to lower the 
rate, nor has there ever been one.
Kevin Lamb, director of planning ser
vices, said that there is no simple 
answer. For several years in the early 
1990s, we made a formal effort to con
tact all first and second-year students 
who did not return to Carnegie Mellon. 
For the 1991 fall freshman class, 177 
students did not return to Carnegie 
Mellon. Almost half of these students 
were in academic trouble. They were 
either on academic suspension or with 
cumulative grades of 1.75 or less. We 
found similar results each year that we 
did the study.
Elliot also said that he believes 
there is no simple answer, but a high 
attrition rate is not necessarily a bad 
thing. He said that although it would 
be ideal not to have an attrition rate, 
it is not a realistic goal. The new

Destructive plum pox 
virus arrives in America
STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP)  No one 
knows just how the destructive plum pox 
virus found its way to North America.
Perhaps a home gardener return
ing from Chile slipped a few peach tree 
buds in a bag and smuggled them in, not 
willing to wait the year or two neces
sary to clear the U.S. quarantine. No 
one knows, because even the culprits would 
not have realized they were carrying infect
ed plants.
The fruit tree virus showed up in a clus
ter of central Pennsylvania orchards in 
October  the first appearance anywhere 
on the continent  and has quickly sowed 
fear in growers around the nation.
The only cure is to bulldoze and burn the 
infected trees.
People are very disturbed about it, very 
uncertain, said John Peters, co-owner of 
four farms that have tested positive for the 
virus. Like many growers, Peter had never 
heard of it before October.
There is no evidence plum pox has spread 
beyond Adams County Only time wall tell, 
because trees can be infected for several 
years before showing symptoms.
The viruss leap to North America is just 
one more example of how worldwide travel 
and trade can spread exotic trouble around 
the globe.
We dont know how serious this will be, 
Peters said. If it gets a foothold, why, it 
could destroy fruit all around the country.
The experts say hes right.
This is one of the important viruses 
that we hoped would never get here, said 
John Halbrendt, a Penn State University 
plant pathologist.
The plum pox virus affects stone fruit 
trees, such as peach, plum, nectarine, a 
pricot and almond trees. The disease does 
not harm humans, but the fruit becomes 
ugly, mottled with rings  and unmar
ketable. The infected trees eventually stop 
producing fruit.
About 800 acres on four farms are known 
to be affected, all within a two-mile radius 
of Gardners in Adams County, about 115 
miles west of Philadelphia. Testing contin
ues on 6,000 leaf samples. The economic 
impact is still unclear but could reach sev
eral million dollars.
Potentially, were talking about hun
dreds of acres, or perhaps thousands of 
acres if the USDA draws a circle around the 
infected trees and says, Everything in this 
circle must go, Halbrendt said.
The virus can spread in two ways:
 Farmers, hobbyists, and gardeners 
unintentionally buy and sell infected buds 
and roots used to grow new trees. The vims 
is contained in the trees tissues.
 Sap-sucking insects called aphids chew 
on infected trees leaves, then transfer the 
virus to healthy trees.
To contain the virus, the U.S. Department 
of Agriculture quarantined a two-township 
area. The movement of buds or roots is pro
hibited. Canada has already barred stone 
fruit tree imports from the United States.
The virus is rather slow-moving, which 
is definitely an advantage, said Robert 
Bunty, the Pennsylvania Department of 
Agriculture spokesman. Theres not going 
to be a problem with aphids in the winter, 
so if we can maintain this quarantine, there 
wont be any danger of spread.
The virus has been a serious problem 
overseas since it was identified in 1910. 
In 1994, for example, some 100 million 
trees were infected in Europe. Egypt, 
Turkey, Syria, India, and Chile also have 
had infestations.
The USDA had kept the virus out of the 
country with strict quarantines. Anyone 
bringing in certain plants are required by 
law to turn them over to APHIS, the Animal 
and Plant Health Inspection Service. The 
plants go through a battery of tests over two 
years to search for viruses. If theyre 
cleared, they can stay.
Penn State bus 
crash kills two
WHITE HAVEN, Pennsylvania 
(AP)  Four buses packed with 
Penn State University students 
crashed in thick fog early Sunday, 
killing at least one student and a 
bus driver and injuring 106 people, 
authorities said.
The buses were among six carry
ing 280 students home from a shop
ping trip to New York, university 
spokesman Bill Mahon said.
Three of the buses traveling 
together on Interstate 80 apparent
ly slammed into each other and a 
fourth hit a guard rail, authorities 
said. A car and a pickup truck were 
also involved in the 1 am wreck, 
police said.
Four hospitals treated the most 
seriously injured. Various churches 
in White Haven took in those with 
less serious injuries.
We offer our condolences to the 
families of the deceased and want 
to do everything possible to assist 
the other students who made this 
trip, University President Graham 
B. Spanier said.
Other details, including the iden
tities of the victims and the extent 
of the injuries, were not immedi
ately available.
Thick fog hovered on the highway 
early Sunday, but police did not 
immediately say whether it played 
a role in the crash.
Former student 
sues MIT
CAMBRIDGE, MA (U-WIRE)/ 
Harvard Crimson  A 1998 MIT 
graduate who had his diploma sus
pended this summer for involve
ment with the death of a first-year 
fraternity pledge sued the universi
ty Tuesday for breach of contract 
and intentional infliction of emo
tional distress.
Charles H. Yoo was pledge leader 
for the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity 
in September 1997 when Scott 
Krueger, a freshman pledge, died 
of alcohol-poisoning at a frater
nity party.
More than a year after his gradu
ation, MIT charged Yoo with hazing 
and violating the schools fraternity 
policy. MITs Committee on 
Discipline voted in August to 
revoke Yoos diploma for five years.
Yoo denies hazing Krueger.
We didnt want a tragedy to 
occur. We just wanted to create an 
event that was fun for everyone in 
the house, Yoo said Wednesday.
The Committee on Disciplines 
rules and regulations states that 
MIT can withdraw academic 
degrees after graduation for 
actions that occurred before 
graduation but were unknown at 
that time.
Yoos attorney, Timothy M. 
Burke, charged MIT with violating 
its own policies by suspending Yoo 
after he graduated. Burke said the 
college was aware of the death and 
criminal investigation while Yoo 
was still a student.
Obviously MIT was fully aware 
of the ongoing investigations 
being conducted by the District 
Attorneys office because MIT was
a target of the investigation, 
Burke said.
Burke suggested that MIT 
chose to discipline Yoo almost two 
years after the death in order to 
avoid financial damages in impend
ing litigation.
Based on my opinion MIT is now 
going to be the subject of a civil suit 
by the estate of Scott Krueger, 
Burke said.
NAACP claims 
SAT tests unfair
EAST LANSING, MI (UWIRE)/77ie State News  The 
NAACP wants American universi
ties to rely less on college entrance 
exams when admitting students 
because it says the tests are unfair 
to minorities.
It is a stand drawing praise 
from Michigan State University 
minority leaders and students, but 
not necessarily because the tests 
are discriminatory.
These tests can have a use
ful purpose, but the problem 
occurs when the entire focus 
of the school system is teach
ing students how to pass a test, 
said Luis Garcia, MSU ChicanoLatino student affairs coordin
ator. The problem doesnt just lie 
with minority students, but every
one. We need to focus more on 
teaching these students to be criti
cal thinkers.
The National Association for the 
Advancement of Colored People 
will hold a press conference in Los 
Angeles today, announcing its cam
paign to lessen the importance of 
standardized tests and help minor
ity and low-income students pre
pare for the tests.
The organization claims college 
entrance exams, such as the 
Scholastic Aptitude Tests and 
American College Test, are unreli
able and unfair to minorities.
They are the first large national 
organization of their type not 
only to criticize the test but to 
encourage minorities to do better 
on the test, said Jay Rosner, direc
tor of the Princeton Review 
Foundation, the nations largest 
SAT preparation company. It is 
really a positive, two-pronged 
approach that I think is whats 
called for these days.
Onte McClendon, mechanical 
engineering freshman and Black 
Student Alliance representative to 
Residence Hall Association, took 
the ACT and thinks colleges put toe 
much emphasis on these tests. ,
[Taking the standardized tests] 
causes too much stress, he said. I 
was afraid if I didnt get a high 
score I wouldnt go to college.
Microsoft antitrust trial judge appoints mediator for negotiations
WASHINGTON (AP)  In 
a move that raises the likeli
hood of an out-of-court settle
ment, the judge in the 
Microsoft antitrust trial 
appointed a mediator to oversee 
voluntary negotiations between 
the government and the soft
ware giant.
U.S. District Judge Thomas 
Penfield Jackson late Friday 
appointed Richard Posner, the 
chief judge of the 7th U.S. 
Circuit Court of Appeals in 
Chicago, leaving it up to Posner 
to set the manner and dura
tion of any talks.
Microsoft Corp., whose stock 
jumped nearly $5 Friday in 
after-hours trading to $90.97, 
called the move a very pos
itive step toward resolving 
this case.
Both sides said they will work 
with Posner, who was appointed 
to his post by President Reagan, 
as was Jackson. Microsoft 
spokesman Jim Cullinan said 
the company wants to reach a 
fair and reasonable solution. 
The Justice Department 
called Posner a highly respect
ed jurist and said it has 
always been willing to seek a 
settlement that would promote 
competition, innovations, and 
consumer choice.
Jackson, who ruled two weeks 
ago that Microsoft is a monop
oly that stifled competition and 
hurt consumers, has encour
aged the two sides to settle. He 
structured his verdict to come 
in two phases in an apparent 
effort to push lawyers toward 
the bargaining table.
This greatly enhances the 
chances for settlement, said 
Kevin Arquit, a New York 
antitrust lawyer who has 
worked for Microsofts rivals.
Posner has generally been 
inclined against breaking up 
companies in antitrust cases, 
one of the tough remedies under 
consideration for Microsoft by 
government lawyers, legal 
experts say.
Hes going to be very skepti
cal of that solution, said 
William Kovacic of George 
Washington University. His 
published views on divestiture 
as an antitrust remedy are not 
favorable toward divestiture. 
But other antitrust specialists 
said Posners conservatism 
might view a breakup of 
Microsoft as the cleanest solu
tion to avoid a federal courts 
continued oversight of the fastchanging technology industry.
I dont think he would be 
very enamored with the idea 
that a federal judge should con
tinuously monitor Microsofts 
marketplace decisions, said 
Washington antitrust lawyer 
George Cary.
In another decision Friday, 
Jackson invited Harvard law 
professor Lawrence Lessig  
whose previous courtroom 
involvement with Microsoft was 
rejected by an appeals court  
to advise him by submitting 50 
pages of recommendations 
before Jan. 31.
Microsoft had successfully 
challenged the judges appoint
ment of Lessig in December
1997 as a special master
to look into important technical 
issues in a related case. 
The company accused him of 
bias and cited an old email mes
sage in which Lessig told 
Netscape Communications 
Corp. he had sold my soul by 
installing Microsofts Web 
browser software.
That fight focused on 
Microsofts decision to give 
away its browser as part of its 
dominant Windows software, a 
move the government said was 
an illegal attempt to crush 
demand for rival software from 
the former Netscape.
In the broader battle, 
Microsoft and the government 
have held three negotiating 
sessions since the trial started 
in October 1998. They remain 
far apart on crucial issues.
In remarks this week, 
Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates 
appeared willing to nego
tiate. But government lawyers 
bristled after Gates and other 
executives outlined what they 
wont consider.
Gates said, for example, 
that Microsoft wont sur
render its right to decide which 
features it can add to Windows. 
He also indicated his opposi
tion to a public auction of 
the software code for Windows, 
the operating system that 
runs most of the worlds per
sonal computers.
The company said further it 
would resist allowing computer 
makers to modify Windows on 
the machines they sell, and it 
said it was opposed to any talk 
of a corporate breakup.

women in Saipan have 
barely enough to live on, 
and when one considers the 
amount of revenue that the 
GAP takes in every year, it 
is very clear that they can 
afford to pay the women 
more, Abad pointed out.
Most people in this 
country dont even know that 
Saipan exists, said Bhumika 
Muchhala, who organized 
Abads talk on Tuesday, but 
we all shop at the GAP. Neil 
Donnelly, a staff member, 
also attended the meeting: I 
thought it was good to hear 
a first-person account of 
things that go on in a sweat
shop  it put a face to stati 
tics, he said.

Health Services gets questioned
HEALTH, from page 1
requested that Health Services test 
me for that did they finally diagnose 
the problem correctly, he said.
I appreciate that not every stu
dent experience with the Health 
Center is what they wish it to be. 
Certainly, when you are not feeling 
well you want extra-special care, 
said Murphy. Murphy also men
tioned that there has been 24-hour 
on-call physician support added. 
According to Murphy, CMU Health 
Services has a good relationship 
with the Pittsburgh medical commu
nity. [We are] constantly striving 
for improvement, decrease in time 
for appointments and faster, efficient 
service. [There is] complete confi
dence in [the] quality of medical 
care, said Barkin.
The problems the Health Center 
officials seem to face are the 
expansion of sources such as prac
titioners and the availability of
physical space. Although the cen
ter has expanded in its resource 
base considerably] over the past 
ten yeas, there is always room to 
grow, said Murphy. Barkin also 
mentioned an outreach education 
program in the community.
In general, we always need to 
be seeking out areas where there 
may be value in further resources. 
The center may be such an area, 
said Dean Murphy.
There has been rumor of a menin
gitis breakout on campus. However, 
Barkin denied this to be the case. 
There is no way that breakout 
would happen without the involve
ment of Carnegie Health services 
and the Allegheny County Health 
Department, said Barkin. It is a 
policy that if a Carnegie Mellon 
student is infected with meningitis 
and happens to go to the hospital, 
the county would notify CMU, and 
vice versa.Council has high aspirations for diversity on campus
DIVERSITY, from page 1
Tracy Futhey, vice provost for 
Computing Services and council mem
ber, said, Diversity in all forms is 
extremely important to Carnegie 
Mellon ... I think the real challenge, 
and the one the Diversity Advisory 
Council can help to tackle, is the spe
cific tactics we use to encourage, 
develop, and support that diverse 
campus environment... I hope the new 
council can provide some more indepth discussion and analysis of some 
of those recommendations, and can 
provide support for the implementa
tion of the recommendations.
Besides the advisory council, many 
other organizations and positions exist 
in order to promote and support diver
sity. Tademy works as director for 
Equal Opportunity Services in order to 
assist management and supervisors in 
arriving at solutions to equal employ
ment- problems, including coaching, 
consultation, collaboration, and train
ing. He also serves as a liaison between 
the University and minority organiza
tions, womens organizations, and com
munity action groups concerned with 
employment opportunities for minori
ties and women.
The Carnegie Mellon Action Project 
(CMAP) has been working since 1968 to 
support and retain African-American 
and Hispanic students. The program 
works with Admissions in order to aid 
with the recruitment of minority stu
dents and holds a summer program 
aimed at exposing students to an acad
emic environment similar to what they 
will experience once they begin classes. 
CMAP also offers academic advising, 
tutoring, monitoring, and counseling to 
minority students.
Other organizations such as 
National Society of Black Engineers 
(NSBE), Society of Hispanic 
Professional Engineers (SHPE), and 
the Black Graduate Student 
Organization (BGSO) all work to sup
port African-American and Hispanic 
students at CMU.
By bringing such a wide range of peo
ple together, including the directors of 
minority organizations such as CMAP, 
Tademy hopes they will be able to bring
a central focus and goal to the issue of 
diversity at CMU.
Besides these objectives, Tademy 
hopes that the group will be able to 
grow together.
Cohon and Nair both hope that the 
promotion and emphasis on diversity 
will make for a better education and 
experience for the students at CMU. 
Nair attended a diversity conference 
called Educating All of One Nation  at 
which she learned of a program orga
nized and run at the University of 
Maryland. The program involved divid
ing first-year students at the university 
into smaller groups of 20-25 called 
clusters. Each cluster of students 
would attend all of their lectures togeth
er and also have seminars to discuss 
their progress. At the end of the year, the 
programs organizers realized that the 
clusters with more diverse members 
seemed to be happier and more enthusi
astic about their classes because of the 
variety and mixture of ideas that came 
out of their group discussions. These are 
the kind of results Nair hopes will come 
out of the focus now placed on diversity.
Faculty and staff are not the only 
members of the Carnegie Mellon com
munity to be concerned with diversity. 
Students are also concerned about these 
issues. Rita Tovar-Gamero, a junior pol
icy management and Spanish double 
major said, Diversity was the decisive 
factor for me in choosing which college 
to attend. I am extremely pleased to be 
part of an institution that regards the 
issue of its own diversity as one of its 
highest priorities. In reference to the 
necessity of support organizations such 
as CMAP, she said, I believe that its a 
good idea for people to be able to have 
access to a common group of peers to 
share their experiences with, especially 
if theyre part of a minority and dont yet 
feel comfortable with other people. Its a 
bond that makes it easier to transition 
to college life.
Sophomore computer science major 
and SHPE member Kevin Burns agreed 
that it was important to have a group of 
peers to look to for support and assis
tance, but he also felt that minorities 
have a tendency to remain isolated with 
their own ethnic group. While I think
that it is important to have groups sue 
as SHPE and NSBE, I also think the 
minority students need to join with othe 
ethnic groups to share experiences an 
ideas. The intermingling of all groups o 
campus is what would result in th 
greatest benefit to all students and serv 
as the best example of diversity
The advisory council will examin 
many possibilities to best promote an 
support diversity at CMU. They wi 
target both the recruitment of minorit 
students and also support and reter 
tion once they arrive on campus.

NIH grant allows 
new mind center
Carnegie Mellon In Brief
MIND-BODY, from page 1
The breast cancer and heart 
disease projects are interven
tion studies, said Cohen. We 
will actually attempt to treat 
patients with different psycho
logical resources and study how 
they affect the subject.
The newly formed Mind-Body 
Center has much to offer the 
studies. There will be a set of 
core resources: the administra
tive group that will handle the 
budget and related tasks, the 
biological core that will take the 
measurements, and the meth
ods core which will put the col
lected data together.
The Mind-Body Center pro
vides an existence of central
resources and promotes intellec
tual interactions and social col
laborations that we wouldnt 
have been able to do otherwise, 
said Cohen. Its much more effi
cient to have a central resource 
then to individually contract 
out, and this allows the data 
from all of the projects to be 
used in the other projects. 
Twenty-five different centers 
applied for this grant at the end 
of May. Four other centers were 
awarded equal grants at the 
University of Michigan, the 
University of Wisconsin, 
University of Miami in Florida, 
and Ohio State University. The 
grant period began on 
September 30.

be funded from the Research 
Seed Fund. Established as part 
of the Strategic Plan, the fund 
is intended to provide initial

with the assumption that they 
will seek additional funding 
from other sources. A total of
one million dollars was granted 
to the 18 projects, which were 
selected from a total of 66 
requests. For this competition, 
the funds were restricted to 
areas identified in the Strategic 
Plan, including information and 
communications technology, 
biotechnology and health policy, 
and environmental research. In 
addition, all of the requests had 
to be interdisciplinary.

In last weeks article Microsoft issue resonates at CMU it was stated that Seth Goldstein made a deal to purchase 300 copies of 
Microsoft Visual Studio. In fact the software was free to students because of a gift from Microsoft Research.
Last weeks article on Page 2 with the headline Yale evicts anti-semitic student should have read Dartmouth evicts anti-semitic student.
In last weeks editorial Academic advising needs improvement, Student Senate is accredited with surveying advising in H&SS. 
In fact, the task force dealing with the survey of students is being put together by the H&SS Student Advisory Council, Jay Devine 
Associate Dean of H&SS, as well as other faculty and staff members.
In last weeks sports article Tartan runners miss out on repeat nationals trip, only the top two teams qualified for nationals, not 
the top four. Also, individuals who qualified were the top six finishers from non-qualifying teams, not the top 10 overall. This means

Lamb explained the process of rank

attributed to graduation. A schools
Elliot said that while CMUs attrition 
rate is high relative to some schools, it 
is not high relative to schools that are 
primarily technical institutions. The 
attrition rate is high at MIT and 
Caltech; however, it is not high at
graduation rate, which is 80 percent of places like Johns Hopkins or Princeton 
the retention score, reflects the average University. Elliot said that there is no
systematic study 
comparing the rate 
of attrition at dif
ferent universities. 
Elliot said that 
CMU is a hard 
school, and he is 
proud of the fact. 
One of the reasons 
that student might 
leave CMU is 
because they get 
poor grades.
You cant find as 
much evidence for 
grade inflation at 
Carnegie Mellon 
as you can find at 
other places, said 
Elliot. There are 
students who fail 
classes at CMU. 
Evidently, at some 
institutions failing 
grades are simply 
not given. A few 
years ago, a failing 
grade at Stanford 
was not a possibili
ty. I know about 
the quality of 
incoming students, 
who probably have 
not had a grade 
below an A or B in 
high school, they 
come here and find 
out that they have 
to work pretty 
hard to get good 
grades at Carnegie 
Mellon. In some cases, they talk to 
their friends at other schools and find 
out that maybe those students are not 
working as hard, but still getting good 
grades. They think, why should I work 
this hard at Carnegie Mellon when I 
can get better grades and not work as 
hard some where else? 
While deciding to transfer is not an 
uncommon decision, some students 
may'feel upset at their experience at 
CMU. Faith Fuligivite was formerly an 
H&SS student. A drama enthusiast,
Justin Suissa/Tartan Assistant Art Editor

THAN A HOTEL ROOM
she wanted to become an acting major, 
but entrance into the drama depart
ment was denied.
I auditioned. Even a BHA would 
have been nice. It was very frustrating, 
I think that the CFA is very subjective 
about the way they chose their stu
dents. They even seem a little snooty, 
she said.
She stayed at CMU for a year before 
deciding to move to a theater conserva
tory, the Cornish College of the Arts in 
Seattle. She said that by moving, she 
will have more opportunity than she 
was allowed at CMU. She regrets that 
CMU did not work for her, but on the 
other hand, she will be able to pursue a 
study that she is passionate about.
Elliot siad this particular reaction 
to the inability of getting into CFA is 
not an issue. CMU gives its students 
plenty of opportunity, but with every 
college, there is a screening process. 
When students apply to CMU they 
are required to include their high 
school transcripts, which will be 
evaluated to gain entrance. 
Similarly, in order to get into CFA, 
one must show a portfolio or audi
tion. This kind of evaluation is neces
sary because all the colleges at CMU 
require that their students are capa
ble of meeting their demands. There 
is no preferential treatment, but it is 
a question of being able to meet the 
necessary requirements.
Elliot also said that i students may 
also leave the university because they 
miss home.
International students tend to stay 
with a university until they graduate. 
This might be because they have taken 
a greater risk in coming to America and 
have made a bigger commitment to 
their actions than other students said 
Elliot. Non-international students can 
easily leave a university because it is 
difficult and choose to attend an easier 
one nearer to home.
Bryce Corrigan, a former CMU stu
dent who transferred to; the University 
of Chicago, said that CMU did not suit 
his personal needs.
I do not pretend to understand 
__
Carnegie Mellon in the ways that oth
ers do and do not claim to be fully objec
tive. Attrition involves two bodies ol 
influence: the institution, and the indi
vidual. I distinguish the two because 
the latter is typically neglected in these 
discussions, said Corrigan.
Corrigan said he chose to attend 
CMU because he thought that it would 
offer an integrated technical and liber
al arts education. Despite making close 
friends at CMU, enjoying his extracur
ricular activities, and having what he 
described as a positive academic expe
rience, Corrigan was not content. He 
found himself in the category of broad
ly dissatisfied and left in 1998 in his 
sophomore year.
There were areas of personal and 
professional development from which ] 
felt isolated. I wanted my college expe
rience to be well-rounded. I just wanted 
more intellectual and social opportuni
ties. The technocracy and social conser
vatism that dominated professional 
and activist scenes at CMU seemed tc 
be barriers to my progress, he said.
While life is not perfect at the 
University of Chicago, Corrigan who is 
now a junior and pursuing degrees in 
psychology and mathematics, is happ> 
with his work and extracurriculai 
activities. Since he has enrolled at the 
University of Chicago, he has changed 
his concentration four times. He said 
that by leaving CMU, he got a fresh 
start and in the process, also learned 
more about what he would . change 
about CMU if he could.
According to Corrigan, there might be 
an adequate solution to the problem ol 
high attrition.
Id make it a more idealistic and 
intellectual place. Id want humanitar
ians, idealists, sexual and othei 
minorities, philosophers of science, 
and critics of inanimate technology tc 
feel at home in the way I did not. Id 
create a College in which all under
graduates were members, and 
College curriculum, in which all stu
dents were expected to grapple with 
certain issues so that they could 
become well-rounded citizens.

Carnegie Mellon University22 November 1999CFA must address class space issues
Registering for classes can be 
difficult for any student at CMU. 
 However, many students experi
ence additional problems trying 
to register for classes in the 
College of Fine Arts. Specifically, 
students who have tried to regis
ter for a class at Pittsburgh 
Filmmakers through CMU this 
semester have experienced par
ticular difficulty due to a short age of available spaces. In addi
tion, students experience difficul
ties enrolling in introductory
 courses supposedly open to all
 majors due to shortage of spaces 
or failure to meet unadvertised 
requirements. These problems 
must be addressed in order for 
CFA to fulfill the Universitys
. promise of interdisciplinary 
- opportunities for all students.
1 The University reserves around 
100 subsidized spots for students 
to take classes at Pittsburgh 
Filmmakers. However, this year 
nearly every single spot was 
taken up by seniors, leaving no 
room for anyone else to take these 
classes. The addition of three new 
.minors requiring these classes 
. makes their availability to CMU 
students imperative. This situa
tion is especially frustrating 
because the classes arent neces
sarily full  the limiting factor is 
in the number of spots that CFA 
is willing to subsidize.
Since there are few photogra
phy courses and no filmmaking 
courses offered at CMU, students 
who require a course atCluster printers dont meet campus demand
Printing documents is an 
intrinsic aspect of being a stu
dent, and it is imperative that 
CMUs clusters fully meet the 
campus printing needs. Although 
Computing Services upgraded 
cluster printers to handle a large 
number of jobs and reduce queue 
 sizes two years ago, these mea
sures have not been adequate to 
fulfill demand for these services. 
Printing capabilities need to be 
expanded to better handle stu
dents needs for document print. ing and color print requests.
Though cluster printers are 
designed to handle high demand, 
having only two in each major 
location causes delays. Printers 
are regularly tied up for extended 
periods of time With requests to 
print large documents. 
Compounding the problem, a 
printer often becomes disabled 
due to mechanical failure or lack 
of toner. Cluster Services should 
seek to purchase more printers 
and better maintain those 
already there.
Additionally, clusters are often 
occupied by classes throughout 
morning and afternoon hours on 
weekdays. These classes cause an 
obstruction to students who need 
to print, and if students print 
from their personal computers, 
they have little way of knowing if 
a cluster is occupied since such 
information is only available on 
signs at the clusters themselves. 
Having dedicated printing sta
tions outside the cluster that stu
dents could log into for 10 minPittsburgh Filmmakers for a 
minor, and who cant get in 
through CFA, must pay over $400 
to register directly. While CFA is 
making an effort to expand its 
photography course offerings, 
there needs to be a short-term 
remedy  perhaps increasing the 
number of subsidized spots  
until photographic facilities on 
campus can be expanded to fill 
the current need.
Non-majors are also encounter
ing problems registering for 
classes within the College of Fine 
Arts. Students have been rejected 
from CFA interdisciplinary class
es because they did not meet cer
tain prerequisites that people 
from their major shouldnt be 
expected to have. The whole point 
of interdisciplinary classes is to 
let people from different back
grounds work together, which is 
one of the primary strengths of 
CMU. Ib deny students access to 
these classes is to deny them the 
chance to explore educational 
opportunities outside of their 
major and expand their horizons.
CFA needs to address its space 
issues, both for its own majors 
and for all students seeking to 
broaden their studies through the 
arts. The college should make 
sure that prerequisites are made 
more clear. Keeping students 
from exploring other areas, espe
cially those in the arts, hampers 
the interdisciplinary spirit that 
makes CMU stand out from so 
many other schools.

utes would alleviate this problem, 
because then students could use 
cluster printers without worrying 
about disrupting classes.
Color printing is currently only 
available through the College of 
Fine Arts. Students wishing to 
use the CFA color printer must 
buy a $40 print card, a needless 
expense for students requiring 
only a few color pages. A long
term solution is needed for the 
color printing issue, which should 
include the purchase of addition
al high quality color printers suit
able for high-volume use.
Since color printing is more 
expensive than black-and-white, 
a system would need to be imple
mented to limit the use of color 
printing to only those who need it 
most, thereby preventing abuse. 
Enforcement of a quota for each 
student or charging for printing 
in a method similar to copicard 
swiping would limit the amount 
of color prints made. Color copy
ing costs could also be charged 
directly to student accounts.
Many other universities charge 
for printing in clusters, and 
CMUs maintenance of a blackand-white printing policy without 
such fees is commendable. 
Unlimited use of University 
printers is a great privilege for 
the student body and one that is 
appreciated. The University 
should seek to preserve the bene
ficial policy of unlimited blackand-white printing while expand
ing the capabilities of clusters to 
better manage the large demand.

anthropic event, Mr. Fraternity.
This year the event was attended by 
a standing-room-only audience, and 
members from 17 Greek houses partic
ipated in raising money for the Karen 
Johnson Fund at the Ohio Breathing 
Association. Kappa Alpha Theta also 
thanks all of the members of the cam
pus community, the students, faculty, 
and staff, who donated their efforts, 
time, and money to support our suc
cess in our philanthropic endeavors.
If The Tartan does not wish to per
petrate the belief among the student 
body that it is anti-Greek, perhaps it 
should seek to publish all aspects of 
being involved in the Greek communi
ty, not just negative propaganda. 
Greeks are involved in philanthropies, 
honor societies, sports, and campus 
organizations other than their chapter.
It is extremely discouraging that 
one of the biggest charitable events 
on campus could not even have a sin
gle photo, as a sign of support, in 
the Universitys student news
paper. The members of Kappa Alpha 
Theta are proud of their efforts to pro
mote a philanthropic spirit in the 
Universitys student body and Greek 
community, and we are disappointed 
that The Tartan does not appear to 
share our enthusiasm.

used to
support his arguments are either 
inaccurate or completely untrue. I 
wish to refute the most significant of 
these misstatements.
Mr. Babra incorrectly described 
U.S. defense funding as uninterrupt
ed. In fact, budget figures published 
on the Pentagons Web site show 
that federal outlays for defense 
have steadily decreased from 23.1 per
cent of the budget in 1990 to 14.8 per
cent in 2000 (http://www.
defenselink.mil). The columns head
line compounds the error by describing 
our time as an era of peace.
The end of Cold War bipolar tensions 
has allowed ancient human rivalries 
to resurface in deadly ways, posing 
many threats to worldwide stability 
and U.S. national security. The same 
source reveals that U.S. forces have 
participated in 91 conflicts since the 
end of the Cold War. Our services are 
busier now than they ever were during 
the Cold War, but they have far fewer 
resources with which to accomplish 
their missions.
The U.S. never used radioactive 
dispersal weapons during the Gulf 
War. As its name implies, depleted 
uranium is a much less radioactive 
form of natural uranium. Many 
nations employ depleted uranium 
shells because the materials high 
density allows it to penetrate tank 
armor more effectively. The small 
amount of particles released when 
the shells strike are no more toxic to 
humans than conventional battle
field materials like lead, gunpowder, 
or jet fuel. According to a report 
published by the RAND Corporation, 
only limited evidence suggests 
that even chronic exposure 
to natural uranium in food or 
water, except presumably at 
extraordinary concentrations, is asso
ciated with morbidity in man or ani
mals. This conclusion makes it 
unlikely that DU [depleted uranium] 
would have any such effects. 
(http://www.gulflink.osd.mil/library/ra 
ndrep/du/mr 1018.7. sum.html)
The military-industrial complex 
has not been a growth industry in 
the United States, nor is it essential 
to our economic growth. According to 
the GAOs December 1998 report 
on the defense industry, declining 
military expenditures have caused 
seven defense  company mergers 
since 1993, saving the government 3.3 
billion dollars in annual spending 
(GAO-NSIAD-99-22, available at 
http:Hwww. defensedaily. com/report/def 
ind.0106.pdf).
I am trying to keep this letter short 
so that it will be published. Thus, I 
cannot refute all of the other claims 
that Mr. Babra makes to support his 
arguments. However, based on my 
own experiences and knowledge of his
tory, I question all of them, particular
ly since he did not cite any sources. I 
therefore challenge Mr. Babra to 
reveal his sources in his next column, 
so that The Tartans readers may 
judge the veracity of his statements 
for themselves.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  22 November 19997Afghanistan buckles under economic sanctions
Editors Notebook
by Christopher May
Starving a nation to its 
knees is a fairly effective way 
to change its policies. However, 
this is a rancid abuse of power, 
and must only be used in 
the most extreme of situations. 
The United States has, this 
November 15, illustrated 
its sadistic unfairness in 
imposing a set of sanctions 
on Afghanistan.
The people in the current 
Afghan government, known as 
the Taliban, are Muslim extrem
ists. They are harboring Osama 
bin Laden, a Saudi exile who is 
suspected of killing 224 people 
in the East African U.S. 
embassy bombings. Naturally, 
the United States would like to 
get its hands on this suspected 
criminal, as any nation so 
viciously wronged would.
However, it gambled away 
all its righteousness with 
these sanctions.
The United Nations has pro
hibited international flight to 
or from Afghanistan except for 
humanitarian reasons or for 
the Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca. 
After a year of drought, this 
has crippled Afghanistan by dri
ving food prices up. The United 
Arab Emirates can no longer 
send food, mail, and medicine as 
they had in the past. 
Additionally, many Afghans are 
dependent on relatives who 
send money from foreign coun
tries. This source of relief, too, 
has been cut off.
Despite the fact that the 
United States has no extradi
tion treaty with Afghanistan, 
Afghan foreign ministers 
have met with the United 
States repeatedly to attempt 
to resolve the situation. 
However, the meetings produced 
little progress, since Afghan 
culture prohibits them from 
giving a guest up to his enemies. 
Finally, the United States deter

truly believe in life, 
liberty, and the pursuit

biased. However, I wonder how 
fair his trial will be once he is in 
the land of his enemies. Perhaps 
this option could be explored 
more thoroughly. Perhaps the 
Afghans would allow him to be 
tried in Pakistan or some other 
neutral country. If the United 
States is truly only seeking jus
tice, surely there is some neu
tral place on which the two 
countries can mutually agree. If 
there is no such place in the 
world, we are in more trouble 
than I thought.
In this instance, the United 
States is acting like a spoiled 
bully. We have overstepped the 
boundaries of justice to reap 
passionate vengeance. I hope 
that this oversight will be cor
rected shortly and the U.S. min
isters can work out a solution to 
this incident, which all sides can 
agree on without depriving any
one of basic life necessities.

This week might be the 
most important week of 
this century. During 
Thanksgiving break, as 
Americans wine and dine 
in the warmth of their 
homes, the World Trade 
Organization (WTO) 
will be holding its Third 
Round in Seattle. The 
WTO, formed to facilitate 
trade among member 
nations by punishing 
those who impede free 
trade, is widely regarded 
by progressive activists 
as a global, corporatemanaged trade deal  
what critics have dubbed 
a Bill of Rights for 
Big Businesses.
The problem is how 
these barriers to trade 
are defined. Measures con
sidered impediments to 
free trade include subsi
dies provided by govern
ments to help local or 
national businesses sur
vive, safety and environ
mental standards, and 
rules ensuring provision of 
services to all citizens. 
Non-tariff barriers to 
trade include subsidies for 
struggling agricultural 
economies, stipulations to 
keep jobs at home, mea
sures to establish better 
labor human rights stan
dards in sweatshops, and 
protection to local schools 
from falling into the hands 
of private companies. The 
WTOs agenda includes 
many examples of econom
ic pressure overriding
individual nations sover
eignty, including striking 
down the U.S. Clean Air 
Act, supporting U.S. 
efforts to force the 
European Union to accept 
U.S. beef from cattle treat
ed with dangerous levels 
of bovine growth hormone, 
and the suppression of 
small countries: The U.S. 
was granted authority by 
the WTO to impose $200 
million in trade sanctions 
against European imports 
because the European 
Union wants to help the 
economies of countries 
they once suppressed. 
These are the kinds of 
measures imposed by the 
WTO. Can you imagine 
what will happen when 
our schools, hospitals, and 
natural resources like 
water are opened up to
international trade?
A dispute resolution 
committee makes these 
decisions. The decision
making panels, composed 
of bureaucrats, are closed 
to the public and the 
press. The standards of 
evidence, especially in 
cases involving public 
health and genetically 
altered foods, are lax at 
best and often arbitrarily 
disregard expert testimo
ny and recognized scientif
ic data. Typically, WTO 
rulings rest on precious 
little in the way of actual 
law. The fact that the 
process of decision-making 
is closed to the public 
immediately says some
thing huge  the WTO is 
not in the interest of the 
people. It is not a democra
tic institution. Their track
record clearly favors profi
teers over the interests of 
the planets people.
Multinational corpora
tions, viewing any compet
itive practice or attempt 
to regulate business as 
against their interests, 
want new absolute rights 
to operate in any country, 
even though local busi
nesses in developing coun
tries fragile econo
mies will be brutally 
crushed. Those corpora
tions desires will be grant
ed in the WTO Millennium 
Round in Seattle next 
week, as proponents will 
argue that local firms in 
developing countries 
benefit by becoming 
more efficient when facing 
competition from abroad. 
Thus, southeast Asian 
and Latin American gov
ernments will be robbed of 
their ability to avoid 
monopolization by huge 
multinational corpora
tions, and this will result 
in more takeovers and 
mergers that will under
mine true competition.
Simply put, the sole aim 
of the WTO is to turn the 
planet into one big mar
ketplace, with a single set 
of one-dimensional rules 
imposed by Western pro
liberalization economics 
that bind all nations, rich 
and poor alike, at all 
times, at all costs.

Psychologists controversy underscores American consumerism
Neil Babra
Theres a small controversy 
brewing over a letter recently 
sent to the American 
Psychological Association (APA). 
Sixty psychologists have peti
tioned the influential organiza
tion to admonish members who 
use their skills to assist corpora
tions in marketing to children. 
Though the APA is committed to 
alleviate human suffering, the 
dissenting members contend 
that a large gap has arisen 
between the APAs mission and 
the drift of the profession into 
helping corporations influence 
children for the purpose of sell
ing products to them.
This controversy is extremely 
relevant, not only for the issue
of contention, but because of the 
greater implications that it 
draws. If corporate advertising 
is proved to be a subversive 
force aimed at children, then it 
exposes the possibility that cor
porations are capable of exploit
ing the general public as well. 
While some psychologists have 
discovered links between adver
tising and. sicknesses such as 
obesity and anorexia in the 
young, others are employed in 
billion-dollar ad campaigns. 
This situation is an example of 
autocratic organizations with 
massive resources manifesting 
their will with no countervailing 
power from the public. Under 
the effect of these resources, 
every person is as exploited as 
the children that the petitioners 
of the APA defend.
The social malady generated 
by Big Business in its zeal to
commercialize is one that is 
even more dangerous than the 
aforementioned sicknesses  20 
percent of the worlds population 
consumes 80 percent of the 
worlds resources, which of 
course they do not need. Though 
economists tell us that this is 
evidence of booming prosperity, 
there are of course a few figures 
that they leave out of the equa
tions. Over 1,500 scientists, 
including half of all living Nobel 
Prize winners, are signatories of 
a declaration that we are 
destroying the worlds life-support systems. While Captain 
Planet tells children that they 
can save the world by turning 
th faucet off while brushing 
their teeth, the commercial 
breaks urge them to destroy the 
world in the interest of profit.
Of course, there is the spiritual problem as well. What
becomes of our humanity when 
it is commercialized? We get 
upset if the products we see in a 
movie are not brand-named, 
because to us that is not reality. 
Our daily habits, even our tradi
tions, are corporate-sanctioned. 
Consider the time-honored prac
tice of blowing out the candles 
on your birthday cake, cemented 
by the Kodak corporation so that 
it could demonstrate the need 
for Kodak fast film and the 
Kodak flashmatic attachment 
on your Kodak camera. And 
then there is Christmas.
The holiday season, at least in 
retail terms, begins on 
November 26, the Friday after 
Thanksgiving. That day is gen
erally rated as the busiest shop
ping day of the year, when our 
disgusting consumerist habits 
reach their zenith. The Media 
Foundation has created some
thing of a holiday to replace it, 
one that is perhaps the right 
kind of protest for our times: 
Buy Nothing Day.
The campaign, as its name 
implies, is a call on American 
consumers to limit their con
sumption for a day. It even 
involves nationwide television 
commercials, though the major 
broadcast networks refuse to air 
them. CBS even frighteningly 
claims that they ask viewers to 
act contrarily to the current 
economic policy of the United 
States. Buy Nothing Day is a 
powerful symbolic act of dissent 
 its celebration could stimu
late awareness of a problem 
whose major cause is ignorance.
Neil Babra is a senior 
coginitive science major. He wel
comes all responsible replies to 
his column.
Thanksgiving. A holiday 
that all Americans can cele
brate  and a chance to get 
the heck out of here for a few

I Column as I See em
by Colt Foutz
Okay, Ill admit it  I didnt watch 
the Ohio State/Michigan game this 
past Saturday.
Now, this is a big deal for a die-hard 
Buckeyes fan such as myself, born in 
Columbus, raised in a football-mad 
Ohio steel town, and brought up to 
believe that Brutus the Buckeye isnt, 
in fact, some crazy fan who had fol
lowed his team spirit to the terminal 
stages of mascot-dom, but just another 
guy like me who loves Ohio State, only 
Brutus just happens to have a buckeye 
for a head. I dont, by the way, but I still 
invest my hopes and dreams and most 
of my grocery money on friendly 
wagers every November when the 
Buckeyes take on the hated Wolverines 
from up north in Michigan in the land 
where people talk like theyre from 
Cleveland, only theyre ugly and have 
the I.Q. of a football, which probably 
explains why they choose to root for 
those Wolverines.
See? So while Ive been indoctrinated 
since birth, and am still prone to laps
ing into sudden chanting (Coach John 
Cooper, King of the Solemn Game of 
Big Ten College Football, I sign away 
my first-born son to you)  sorry, hap
pens every so often  I still am, on 
occasion, able to stop eating from the 
bowl of popcorn sitting on my lap, set it 
next to the plate of cold cuts and Swiss 
cheese, down the rest of my beer, and 
lift myself off of my couch and walk 
away from the TV set. Okay, so Im usu
ally only getting up to get more beer, 
but the point is that occasionally my 
attention wanders. Well, last Saturday, 
I found myself drifting away from the 
high-calorie comfort and decidedly 
meaty smell of my living room couch to 
indulge in a healthier, but still very 
guilty, pleasure.
Sorry Mom, sorry Dad, sorry Coach 
Cooper (King of the Solemn Game of 
GAHHHHH!). What was I saying? Oh
yes. I pulled myself away from the 
potato chip bag and pulled on my 
reflective MidZero tights and went run
ning instead.
All right, so the tights were a little 
excessive. This weekends balmy tem
peratures meant that I could have hit 
the road in my usual fall outfit of shorts 
and a long-sleeved t-shirt and never 
know the difference between now and 
late September, but I was anxious to 
give the tights a try. What can I say, 
though? Im a winter run
ner, and Im proud of it.
I like to come home 
from school, rush in to 
change, and start my run 
as the sun goes down,
Daylight Savings Time a 
distant memory. I enjoy 
making the trip to the 
hardware store to buy 
one-quarter inch screws 
so I can use them to per
forate the heel of a per
fectly usable pair of run

inspired by the countless 
folks I meet pounding the 
pavement on chilly morn
ing runs, getting up hours 
before work and before 
the heaters in their hous
es even kick on to head 
outside into the biting 
wind and get in a quick 
three miles so they can 
really earn that cup of 
coffee. Heck, I even like 
the sting of cold air in my 
lungs and the way my 
body steams, shrouding 
me with a mist of my own exertion for 
minutes after I finish.
Most of all, though, I run so I can 
take part in the gutsy performances 
and gut-shaking guffaws that charac
terize the wonderful world of coldweather racing.
Were a courageous and oft-times 
crazy crew, the pack of runners youll 
find lining up in freezing temperatures 
at races which bear such names as 
Red-Nosed Run, or Shiver by the 
River, or Turkey Trot. Were different 
from the summer crowd, full of fastwalking round-bodies who linger at the 
back of the pack, holding up traffic to
enjoy the sunshine and fat-burning 
camaraderie of 1,000 or so perfect 
strangers, and oh yes, get a nifty Tshirt in the process. No, were still the 
same round-bodies after the t-shirts, 
its just that we take winter running 
seriously. Or, as serious as you can be 
about donning a green body suit 
adorned with twinkling Christmas 
lights, strapping an actual Christmas 
tree to your body, and attempting to 
run 3.1 miles in the same inclement

weather that kept our pets inside last 
night. Maybe thats why the tree smells 
funny....
At any rate, we winter runners brave 
the elements and the riotous laughter 
from the occasional spectator on his 
way to the car or, more likely, inside, in 
order to prove something to ourselves 
about our physical and mental abili
ties, and have a lot of fun in the 
process. Most of these races are spon
sored by local bars or restaurants, and 
offer lots of games, music, prizes, and 
free food at the end, and many help 
raise money for a specific cause. 
Twenty-five minutes of crazy looks and
frostbitten fingers doesnt seem so bad 
when you consider that your time out 
in the Great White Course can help 
raise money for leukemia, or multiple 
sclerosis, or arthritis. And, much like 
the wise old adage that says you get 
what you give, the smiles you generate 
on the faces of the unseen people that 
youre helping are more than shared in 
the action and antics you witness from 
your fellow runners during the course 
of the race.
_________ For instance, I once wit
nessed a man dressed up 
as a Bud Lite beer can 
navigate the streets of a 
race in a neighboring 
town. The can was con
structed of painted burlap 
stretched over chicken 
wire, with the mans head 
peering out from the top in 
front of a clothes hanger 
pop tab, and probably 
weighed more than the 
Christmas tree the afore
mentioned runner was 
wearing and the two 
wrapped presents run
ning with him (his chil
dren) combined. Thing is, 
the Bud Lite can was run
ning really well, and beat
ing a whole pack of run
ners not similarly attired, 
until the chicken wire 
began to slip and started 
digging into his bare legs. 
Undeterred, the man sim
ply stopped, chucked his 
costume to the ground, 
and rolled it alongside him 
the rest of the way. By the 
time he finished  in his 
thermal underwear, mind you  he 
was a little blue and a little bloody, 
but after a quick stop at the first aid 
tent I spotted him at the bar in the 
restaurant, which sponsored the race. 
He was wearing his beer can costume 
again and drinking a Heineken! 
Hows that for loyalty?
My buddy Luke here told me hed 
buy me all the beer I wanted if I ran the 
race as a can of Bud Lite, the man 
explained. Bud Lites Lukes brand, 
but it sure aint mine! Well put, con
sidering the comment came from a run
ning beer can, and further evidence 
that its not what you drink, its what
you wear that ensures youll get that 
drink free.
Im thinking that I should start a 
club for winter runners, maybe call Us 
the Saint Bernards or something, since 
much like that legendary canine whos 
pressed into service in cases of alpine 
emergency, we winter runners have 
been known to perform just as coura
geously in the cold. And youd be sur
prised how many of us make the trip 
with a beer keg strapped around our 
necks! Or as a beer keg.
Really, having a mascot like the St. 
Bernard could be just the thing to rally 
behind. We could stamp its image on all 
of our nifty racing t-shirts, and imitate 
its distinctive bark as a rallying cry at 
the start of the race, or whenever we 
pass a fellow runner that needs moti
vation. Come to think of it, we could 
have a few St. Bernards on hand at the 
first-aid tent to be sent out to carry us 
to the finish line when our legs cramp 
up from the cold by mile two. And hay
ing a name like the St. Bernards would 
let all those crazy polar bear frozen 
lake swimmers know whos boss! ;I 
mean, what are they thinking, swim
ming in the freezing cold?!!
If youre thinking about joining our 
merry band of harriers, December will 
bring many opportunities to do so, 
starting with the annual Jingle. Bell 
Run for arthritis, sponsored by Max 
and Ermas restaurant. This years run 
is being held in North Park on 
Saturday, December 4, at 10:00 am. 
Just stop by Max and Ermas and pick 
up an application the next time you go 
out for a burger. You can even stay and 
catch a replay of the Ohio State game I 
missed while registering to run for a 
great cause. But the important thing is 
to get out and get running.
I have a feeling its going to a long 
and chilly winter, so heres my holiday 
wish for all of you: May your body be 
covered in a Polartec Power Stretoh 
shell, and may all your miles of road
work end with a steaming mug of 
cocoa, or a Heineken from your pal, 
Luke. See you out in the cold there ^t 
the races, everybody!
Colt Foutz wants to remind all of his 
friends from Michigan that yes, he may 
owe you money after Ohio State lost to 
your lucky team 24-17, but he can also 
outrun you.
Florida-Florida State saves rivalry weekend
Between The Uprights
by Pete Patterson
rivalry week seemed to have a 
little less pizzazz this year than 
in the past. The only drama 
involved in the Michigan-Ohio 
State game was whether the 
Buckeyes would be able to win 
and earn a bottom-feeding bowl 
invite. Auburn-Alabama gave 
the Crimson Tide bragging 
rights in the state of Alabama 
and Shaun Alexander Bamas
Luckily, there was also the 
game that has come to define 
college football in the 90s. 
Every year since 1992, the win
ner of this game has been in 
national title contention after 
the game. Regardless of what 
the outcome was last Saturday, 
the same promised to be true 
this season. Im speaking, of 
course, of Florida-Florida State. 
The Noles came into the Swamp 
ranked number one in the 
nation, with the Gators attempt
ing to improve on their numberthree ranking.
The action on the field didnt 
disappoint. Although the game 
was somewhat sloppily played, 
there was plenty of excitement 
to make the miscues forgivable. 
There was an interception
all-time rushing record, but the 
Tigers mediocrity took away 
from the national importance of 
the game. Stanford beat rival 
Cal to earn the right to be the 
second straight PAC-10 team to 
get run over by Ron Dayne in 
the Rose Bowl. USC-UCLA? 
Oh, please.
Jamie Divine/Tartan Production Staff
return for a touchdown by 
Floridas Benny Alexander. A 
blocked kick by FSUs Tommy 
Polley. A touchdown run by 
wideout Peter Warrick, who 
withstood derisive chants by the 
Gator faithful about his ill-fated 
shopping spree at Dillards to 
catch nine passes for 90 yards to
go along with his scoring jaunt. 
Sebastian Janikowski used the 
girth that makes the Seminole 
kicker look more like a guard to 
power a 54-yard field goal. And, 
of course, the game came down 
to the final play  a hail mary 
pass that fell just out of the 
grasp of Florida wideout Brian 
Haugbrook in the end zone as 
time expired to seal the 30-23 
victory for the Seminles.
The entertainment didnt end 
with the game. One of the coach
es told reporters that the team 
they had faced was not as good 
as they used to be, elaborating 
that the 97 team was a lot bet
ter than the team they have 
now. Was this Bobby Bowden 
gloating over his teams victory? 
No, Bowden was his normal gra
cious self, but Florida coach 
Steve Spurriers post-game com
ments showed that he is slow to 
give credit to his rivals. Had he 
not disrupted the rhythm of his 
team with his amazing rotating 
quarterbacks, Spurrier may not 
have needed to reduce himself to 
taking cheap shots at his oppo
nent after the game. As it stands 
now, however, the Gators will 
have to avenge their early-season loss to Alabama in the SEC 
title game in order to earn a 
BCS bowl invite.
The consequences for Florida 
State are much rosier, especially 
when precedent is considered. 
The only other time this decade 
they had beaten the Gators at 
the Swamp was in their 1993 
national championship season. 
They now possess half of the 
four visiting conquests at 
Florida Field in Spurriers 10- 
year tenure. By completing their 
season undefeated and ranking 
number one in both polls, they 
practically guaranteed them
selves a spot in the Sugar Bowl 
for a shot at the national title. 
There, coach Bobby Bowden will
attempt to complete his first 
undefeated season at the helm 
of the Noles. From the high of 
his 300th career win against son 
Tommys Clemson team to the 
low of Peter Warricks Dillards 
excursion it has been an event
ful season for the Noles.
The perfect ending to this year 
would be a Virginia Tech-Florida 
State match-up for the crown.
Imagine the Hokies Corey 
Moore trying to get to Chris 
Weinke before he can get away 
another pass to Warrick. Picture 
freshman sensation Michael 
Vick facing the vulnerable FSU 
defense. Barring an upset by 
Boston College or the BCS com
puters, these fantasies will 
become a reality. If the game can 
match the excitement of this
weeks action at Florida Field, 
this century of college football 
will be ended with action, excite
ment, and suspense. In other 
words, perfectly.

10The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  22 November 1999Tartans season gets off to slow start
BASKETBALL, from page 12
CMUs defensive pressure, and once 
the ball was past half court Grove City 
was able to score on the Tartans.
Saturday, the team returned home 
to face the Washington & Jefferson 
Presidents. The Presidents got off to 
an early start in the game and quickly 
built it into a lead that the Tartans 
could never make up.
They just had a lot of energy in the 
first half ... and we werent clicking, 
said first-year forward Ross Freeman.
W&J built their lead in the first five 
minutes with a balanced attack that 
the Tartans were not able to contain. 
One player had five points and two 
.more had six for the Presidents during 
Uhat brief stretch. After six minutes of 
. giving up points from inside the paint, 
i outside the arc, and the foul line, 
Carnegie Mellon was facing a 17-4 
deficit and called a time-out.
- -, The time-out gave a short-lived shot 
in the arm to the Tartans, who nar. rowed the point gap to 19-11. 
However, the momentum turned back 
tQ W&Js favor after they hit a threepointer and drew a foul. In a span of 
less than two minutes, the Presidents 
ran the score from 22-11 to 29-11 and 
the Tartans called their second time
out of the game in an attempt to stop 
the bleeding.
This second time-out was less effec
tive for the Tartans. They were able to 
get within 13 points of the 
Presidents at one point; how
ever, two three-pointers from 
W&J helped seal a 21-point 
lead for the Presidents going 
into half-time.
The first half was punctuat
ed by poor shooting and a full 
court press by the Tartans 
that got beat more often than 
it produced turnovers. CMU 
made 34 percent of their 
shots in the first half, and 
only one of eight of their 
three-pointers. Washington 
and Jefferson had much more 
success shooting the ball in 
the half. They made 55.6 per
cent of their shots and nailed 
six of thier seven three-point 
shots for the half.
CMU entered the game 
with the idea of running, but 
the Presidents were able to 
run with them, and backed 
their game plan up with bet
ter three-point shooting and 
more points in the low post.
W&J had nearly twice as 
many rebounds, and was 
slightly better at protecting 
the ball.
The second half was much better for 
CMU. W&J scored seven fast points to

get going offensively in either game last weekend.
add to their lead, but after a time-out, 
the Tartans settled in. The press 
worked more effectively, 
though some easy points were 
given up, and the Tartans 
shooting improved, except at 
the free-throw line.
Carnegie Mellon was able to 
pull within eight points in the 
second half, but never got any 
closer. After going only one of 
12 for three-pointers in the sec
ond half and shooting 63 per
cent from the free throw line, 
all the pressure that the 
Tartans could muster wasnt 
enough to make up for the 21- 
point half-time deficit. 
Sophomore guard Ralph 
Deabrunzzo led the team in 
scoring in the game, and fin
ished with 21 points and 11 
rebounds. Sophomore Dom 
Ionadi and first-year student 
Marc Tata each finished in 
double digits after scoring 10 
points apiece.
The main story of the week
end is that we didnt put two 
good halves together, said 
Wingen, who saw similar 
problems with the two games. 
A big problem in these two 
games is very poor perimeter
shooting and poor free throw shooting^;; 
We want to be aggressive and attack^ 
the basket, and youre going to getJS 
fouled if you do that. Last night 
[Saturday] we got the number of free 
throws we wanted ... but we didnt do 
as well as we could have [in our freethrow shooting].
Wingen plans on keeping the same 
game plan that was used this weekend 
for the rest of the season. He will use a 
deep rotation of players off the bench 
and apply pressure on offense and on 
defense. While the Tartans are smaller 
in size than in previous years, Wingen 
sees them as faster and plans on 
exploiting that.
As for the intensity level throughout 
games, Wingen sees that as an area 
that needs to change sooner rather 
than later.
It needs to come right now, said 
Wingen. I dont want to talk about the 
youth of our team. Yes, we have a 
young team. But most of them have 
played enough basketball.
Wingen expects that the team will 
get better as the season goes on, and 
hopes that by the end of the year the 
team will be good. For now, he is glad 
to see the effort that the. team is 
putting in and the fan support that the 
team received at their first home game 
of the season.

team tends to play down, and we didnt 
play down at all, said head coach 
Gerri Seidl.
CMU dominated the game not only 
with their killer offense, but also with 
their over-powering defense. Junior 
guard Julia Neuman led the defense, 
making sure Chatham didnt get any 
second chances on offense by pulling 
clpwn eight rebounds. Not only did the 
win carry the Tartans to the final 
round of the tournament, it also land
ed them a place in school history. The 
first record set in the game was the alltime team score, broken by a lay-up by 
first-year center Erin Brady. The pre
vious high score for a single game was 
99 points vs. Emory University in 
1988.

was set in the final minutes of the 
game with a three-pointer by Omer. 
The three-pointer brought the Tartans 
to a total of nine three-pointers made, 
which broke the record of eight, set 
against versus Chatham in 1996.
The tournament continued for the 
team Saturday afternoon in the cham
pionship game versus Denison 
University. The game proved to be 
much more of a challenge for the 
Tartans, but they were still able to rise 
to the occasion and earn the win. This 
game was a test for us, and we knew it 
would be, said Seidl.
The Tartans led most of game with 
help from top scorers junior center 
Kara Coval and first-year forward 
Christa Thomas, who scored 13 and 11 
points, respectively. Denison played
tough defensively, but their efforts 
proved to be no match for the Tartan 
offense. CMU held the lead for almost 
the entire game.
With 2:57 left in the game Denison 
was able to tie the score at 51, but that 
was to be the last of their scoring. The 
Tartans went on to sink a total of seven 
free throws in the final minutes to win 
the game 58-51 and sweep the twogame tournament.
The wins were very encouraging for a 
maturing team that suffered through a 
disappointing season last year which 
saw them finish near the bottom of the 
UAA standings. That young team has 
turned into a potential winner.

; The Carnegie Mellon mens 
soccer team finished off their 
season last week with one win 
iEind one loss in the Eastern 
College Athletic Conference 
tournament, bringing their final 
season record to a highly 
respectable 13-2-4.
The action began on 
Wednesday with an away trip to 
Misericordia. This game deter
mined whether or not the 
Tartans would continue post
season play and move on to the 
semifinal round of the ECAC 
tournament. Last year, the 
Tartans faltered in the first 
round of ECAC play, so this 
time, the Tartans were out to
seek redemption. CMU domi
nated Misericordia throughout, 
and made it known that there 
would be no faltering this time 
around. Many goals from all 
over the field gave the Tartans a 
convincing 5-1 victory. This big 
win gave the mens team some 
momentum to carry into 
Saturdays second-round match 
with Johns Hopkins.

ing for the team has had a huge impact 
on their lives. This group will always 
be special to me. I am grateful they 
stuck with the bad times, and its sad to 
see an era end.
I dont want the team to ever forget 
how hard we worked to get to the point 
were at, said Szobota. The team has 
a great future, as long as they keep up 
the work ethic. Personally, volleyball 
was my priority. I just want people to
ning for granted. The five [seniors on 
the team] have really shared a lot 
together and Im sure that well always 
remember that.
With four years of hard work behind 
them, the seniors can step out champi
ons. The biggest challenge for Webb 
and the remaining underclasssmen is 
figuring out how to match the accom
plishments of the most successful CMU 
volleyball season ever.
Tartans win bowl game
the game, as well as allowing that 
CMU was lucky at the beginning of 
the game. [Frostburg] made a few 
costly errors early that allowed us to 
get ahead, he said.
After a Frostburg field goal cut the 
lead to four, Zimpfer coolly connected 
with junior Mike McLaughlin on a 69- 
yard scoring strike, with OMalleys 
kick making the score 14-3.
Just seven seconds later, senior 
defensive back Brian Harris intercept
ed a Bobcat pass and returned it 19 
yards for another CMU touchdown. 
The extra seven points gave the 
Tartans an 18-point cushion, but the 
CMU defense didnt need it.

Even down a lot, [Frostburg] never 
gave up, Lackner said. They are a 
tough bunch of kids.
On the Tartans first possession of 
the final quarter, the offense made 
up for the extra touchdown the 
defense had allowed when Campie 
rushed for his second touchdown of 
the game, this time from the 
Frostburg one-yard line.
After a brief Frostburg possession, 
CMU took over with 8:47 to go and 
put on an amazing display of clock 
management. Keeping the ball on 
the ground, the Tartans muscled 
out first down after first down, 
keeping the Frostburg offense on 
the sideline and, more importantly, 
keeping the clock rolling down. 
Fourteen plays later, the Tartans 
had worn out the entire 8:47 to seal 
the 28-10 victory.
The outstanding performances 
from the teams seniors, including 
Campie, Monsilovich, OMalley, 
and Harris, put an exclamation 
mark on what had been a spectacu
lar four-year career at CMU, culmi
nating with the championship. 
This was a great way to end the sea

deserved it.
Despite the great performances by! 
the seniors, it was the sophomore. 
Zimpfer who walked away with the 
ECAC Southwest Division Most 
Valuable Player. Coming on late in the 
season to replace senior Russ Clay, 
Zimpfer led the late-season resurgence 
that clinched the Tartans an 8-3 
record and a spot in the ECAC bowl 
game after dropping out of the 
University Athletic Association race in 
the middle of the season.
FOOTBALL, from page 12
Quickly shedding the mantle of the 
underdog, the Tartans jumped over 
the Bobcats early, taking control of 
the game in the first seven minutes 
and never relenting.
CMU started impressively, taking 
the opening kickoff and driving to 
the Frostburg 16-yard line when 
senior kicker Pat OMalley missed a 
field goal attempt on fourth-and-10.
A roughing the kicker penalty on 
the Bobcats gave CMU an early 
break, but on fourth-and-five, 
sophomore quarterback Eric
Zimpfers pass was intercepted in 
the end zone.
Frostburg managed two quick 
first downs, but CMU forced a punt 
from midfield and caught another 
break, taking possession at the 
Frostburg 15. After two quick com
pletions by Zimpfer, senior fullback 
Mike Campie plunged into the end 
zone from two yards out for a touch
down. OMalleys kick made the 
score 7-0 CMU, and the Tartans 
would hold the lead for the rest of

stretches of time. CMU held the ball 
for 37:18, not allowing Frostburg any 
offensive chances.
Our defensive unit is nationally 
ranked, and it showed today, Lackner 
said. We stepped up big against an 
explosive offense.
Frostburgs only glimmer of offense 
came early in the third when the 
Bobcats drove 49 yards for a touch-Swimmers head into winter break energized

tition out of lane four to win the 
event.
The Tartan womens team 
also fared well in the breast
stroke events. Senior co-captain 
Erin Rockwell scored victories 
in both the 100 and 200 breast
stroke events. Rockwell swam 
to victory Saturday in the 200, 
finishing in 2:29.88. The results 
were similar in the 100, with 
Rockwell defeating her three 
closest competitors  all Johns 
Hopkins University Blue Jays 
to gain victory.
Swimmers, coaches, and meet 
workers from all sides saw the 
meet as a great success. Several 
competitors came out of the 
pack to score NCAA champi
onship A cuts, giving them 
automatic placement in the 
Championships at Emory this 
coming spring.
I saw a whole lot of fast times 
out there. Because we get to see 
all of the seed times followed by 
the results on the computer, you 
get to see how much these
teams really improved from 
their seasons best times previ
ous. There were also a couple of 
milers [the 1650 freestyle] who 
got A cuts Saturday morning, 
which was really impressive, 
said meet computer operator 
Catherine Nguyen.
Stephanie Harbeson of Johns 
Hopkins and Lindsey Hoffher of 
Emory both surpassed the A 
cut of 17:30.99 in the 1650 
freestyle, as well as breaking 
the pool record in the process 
with times of 17:20.88 and 
17:21.32, respectively. The guys 
milers didnt disappoint, either. 
Johns- Hopkins University firstyear student Scott Armstrong 
bettered the pool record as well 
as the NCAA A cut by finish
ing his mile in 16:09.25.
The Carnegie Mellon divers 
were record-breakers as well. 
First-year student Rose Seyler 
broke the school record on the 
one-meter board, while sopho
more Erin Campbell broke the 
record on the three-meter. 
Campbell said that the differ
ence between this year and last 
year is an increase in confidence 
attributed to new diving coach 
Patty McClure.
Patty really makes you try 
new things. She gives you the 
confidence to believe that you 
can do the dive and, although 
you may crash and burn the 
first couple of times, she helps 
you improve fast and this 
improves your 11 dive order, 
she said.
Although the Tartans didnt 
finish where they hoped, the 
tone following the meet was 
relaxed and enthused.
This meet is really going to 
motivate us to work hard the 
rest of the season. When Dave is 
kicking our ass in the pool, 
were going to really understand 
why. It is because when were 
scrambling for points at UAAs, 
were going to be able to find 
them, said junior wimmer

Swimming team suffers first loss of year
By MICHAEL COOK
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon mens and 
womens swimming and diving teams 
hosted the cream of the crop of the 
University Athletic Association in a 
meet two weekends ago in the 
University Center. Teams from Johns 
Hopkins, Emory, and New York 
University strutted their school colors 
in a fashion show of fast times and 
solid performances on the diving 
boards. All four teams looked forward 
to this midseason measuring stick, a 
chance to measure themselves against
their top competitors of the conference 
and renew old rivalries.
We were all really excited to swim 
fast, we knew that the other schools 
had some great returning swimmers 
and some fast freshmen, and we really 
wanted to see what they had, said 
senior co-captain Mike Onofray.
Great swimmers they saw, as the 
Tartans attacked the pool in their new 
maroon racing suits. Coming off of easy 
victories in the teams first two double
dual meets, the teams and looked for
ward to an exciting meet.
The meet featured the full schedule 
of events, meaning that the teams

would compete in every event (save the 
800 freestyle relay) that they will at 
the UAA championships in February. 
Giving swimmers the opportunity to 
compete in events such as the 400 indi
vidual medley, the 1650 freestyle, and 
the 200 freestyle relay over a two-day 
period meant that the endurance of the 
swimmers would come into question as 
well. Though the team stayed out of 
the weight room the week leading up to 
the meet, the rigorous training pro
gram that coach David Belowich has 
them in was sure to be tough on the 
Tartan squads.
The final results of the meet didnt 
truly display the widespread improve
ment from previous weeks, when CMU 
swimmers achieved season bests 
across the board. Carnegie Mellon fin
ished a disappointing third in both the 
mens and womens meets, falling to 
mens champions Emory and womens 
champs Johns Hopkins.
By the final session, I think that we 
were all pretty tired, but the other 
teams were, too. Thats how its going 
to be at UAAs, though, so we have to 
be ready. Its not such a big deal for me, 
but the people who have to do the 
longer events really must get tuckered 
out, said sophomore Erin Andrews.

the mens team with three individual

event wins over the two days. Robinson 
held on after a strong first 50 to win 
the 100 Freestyle in 49.94. He also fin
ished in a three-way tie for first in the 
50 freestyle as well as coming out of 
lane eight to win the 200 individual 
medley to complete his three-victory 
performance. Robinson was also part of 
the victorious 200 medley and 200 free 
relays, anchoring both squads. The

departure of Robinson from the mix.

more Matt Shewchuk out-touched the 
Emory team.
Striner also turned in strong perfor
mances in his usual events. He went 
out strong in the first half of his 200 
breast, but was unable to hold on dur
ing the second 100, finishing second by 
two-tenths of a second in a season-best 
time of 2:14.81. The fast first 100 was a 
great indicator for what would occur in

Volleyball wins ECAC title
By BRIAN SMITH
Tartan Special Projects Manager
You would think that a 38-6 
record should speak for itself. 
This success, including a victory 
over nationally ranked Emory 
at UAA Championships four 
weeks ago, was not enough to 
give the CMU womens volley
ball team a berth in the NCAA 
nationals tournament, however. 
It was a disappointment and a 
setback that the Tartans were 
instead picked to host the 
regional Eastern College 
Athletic Conference tourna
ment last week, and they set 
out to show they deserved the 
nationals nod.
I was very disappointed that 
we did not go to the nationals, 
said head coach Julie Webb. 
There were a lot of teams in 
that tournament that we could 
easily beat. ... I even got email 
last week from other coaches 
saying that they were outraged 
that we did not get a berth.
Nevertheless, the team 
focused on the task at hand  
winning ECACs.
We were more relaxed than 
ever going into the ECACs, 
said senior Sephanie Szobota. 
We had no doubts that we were 
going to sweep it.
It was great playing at home 
one last time. The turnout was 
great. We would have swept the
tournament whether we played off the most successful CMU senior Ashley Kinsey. I think 
at home or away, but playing at volleyball season ever, despite that is the only thing that I am 
home was definitely nice. not earning the fully-deserved unsatisfied about, and Im not
I knew the competition was NCAA bid too upset about it because
not going to be tough, 
and I was overly confi
dent we were going to 
win, said Webb.
Since the Tartans 
were top-ranked coin
ing into the tourna
ment, they had a bye in 
the first round of play 
on Friday, November 
12. Their first match 
was in the semi-finals 
on the next Saturday 
morning, where the 
squad swept the 
University of
Pittsburgh at Bradford 
(16-6, 15-9, 15-13). 
Next up was familiar 
UAA rival Johns 
Hopkins in the champi
onship match held on 
Saturday afternoon.
[Hopkins] stole a 
game from us at UAAs, 
and we played tired in 
the morning match, 
said Webb. We are not 
a morning team, 
though. We went out toThe volleyball

afternoon and did.
The 15-8, 15-9, 15-9 sweep 
gave the Tartans the ECAC 
tournament crown, brought 
their record to 40-6, and capped
victory.
I loved winning ECACs at 
home, it was great to end the 
season that way, but I believe 
that we deserved to go to the 
National tournament, said
everyone knew that we 
belonged there. Thats all 
that matters.
Senior Sarah Putaro was 
named tournament MVP, 
adding one more title to 
an impressive list of per
sonal honors. In addition, 
Putaro arid Szobota were 
named GTE Academic 
All-Region last week and 
Szobota also won AllRegion honors.
The whole season was 
memorable, said Kinsey. 
We had an awesome 
team, not only skill-wise 
but off the court as well. 
We just laughed and had 
fun the entire three 
months we were together. 
The most memorable 
part of the season is hard 
to say  if I had to pick 
one tournament it would 
be the UAA champi
onships: Beating Emory 
in three games, playing 
in the championship 
game, and, of course, the 
senior skit!

As the last college football 
season of the millennium draws 
to a close, the Carnegie Mellon 
Tartans did not want to be the 
ones missing out on all the cele
brating and partying.
Last Saturdays Eastern 
College Athletic Association 
South Division championship 
was not just another champi
onship game. For the Tartans, 
the game represented the 
schools first post-season 
appearance since 1990, the first
bowl game appearance since the 
1938 Sugar Bowl, and an oppor
tunity to win the first bowl 
game in school history.
Not that the Frostburg State 
Bobcats were going to let CMU 
make history without a fight. 
Returning to the ECAC bowl 
scene after a two-year drought, 
the 8-2 Bobcats were heavy 
favorites over the 7-3 Tartans 
as representatives of the 
tougher Atlantic Central 
Football Conference, as well as 
having home-field advantage for 
the game.

University celebrates Martin Luther King, Jr.
by Sara Stille
Acting News Editor
On Monday, January 17, Carnegie 
Mellon students enjoyed a half day 
off from classes in observance of 
Martin Luther King, Jr. Day. They 
were encouraged, however, to 
remember that it was to be a day 
on, not a day off. The University 
planned several activities and 
events in hopes of raising awareness 
about the life and works of Martin 
Luther King, Jr.
The day began with the first State 
of Diversity Address given by 
President Jared Cohon. He said that 
he hopes that this address will be an 
annual event used to reveal the 
progress of the University towards 
achieving its goals in diversity.
Cohon gave a quantitative 
account of the past and present 
numbers of female, African 
American, American Indian, and 
Hispanic faculty, staff, and under
graduate students dating from 1992 
to 1999. He showed increasing or 
stable numbers in all of the three 
categories.
Diversity is more than just num
bers, though, its whether people 
feel welcome here. We need to be a 
place that celebrates diversity and 
values diversity, said Cohon.
Diversity will allow us to attract 
more of the best and the brightest 
and develop more diverse perspec
tives, he said.
At the end of the address, Cohon 
took questions. Here attendees 
showed concerns about graduate 
student diversity and the effects of 
increasing tuition on the number of 
minority students entering the 
University.
I thought that President Cohen 
meant well by his address, and it 
will be interesting to see how he 
plans to accomplish his goals with
out being unfair to non-minority 
students, said Chris Anderson, a 
sophomore MCS student.
The University also,hosted many 
students from Pittsburgh city 
schools for a creative writing and 
poetry reading. Students won mon
etary writing awards for their works 
from Carnegie Mellon Universitys 
Creative Writing Program. The 
readings dealt with personal experi
ences with racial discrimination. 
Carolyn Manley, the Scheduling 
Coordinator for the University 
Center and Martin Luther King, Jr. 
Day chairperson, said that the event 
was so well attended that they had 
to add 60 chairs to the original 80. 
The event brought in students, 
staff, and outside people.... It was

John Lehoczky will temporarily 
fill the shoes of Peter Stearns as 
interim dean of the College of 
Humanities and Social Sciences 
while a committee works to find a 
permanent replacement.
Lehoczky, the Thomas Lord 
Professor of Statistics, took his new 
title as of January 1 replacing Peter 
Stearns, who resigned after the fall 
semester to take over as provost at 
George Mason University in 
Fairfax, Va.
Lehoczkys short-term goals as 
dean include working with the 
H&SS Advisory Center to make 
sure the department is doing the 
best they can for the students. I 
want to get better connected with 
the students and also get more 
H&SS students to use the Career 
Center and attend the job fair, he 
said.
Lehoczky said that H&SS stu
dents tend to wait until later in 
their college career before search
ing for a job. Since CMU is noted as 
a more technical school, humani
ties students have tougher place
ment problems. Lehoczky said that 
is why it is so important for stu
dents to use the Career Center 
resources and attend Job Fair 2000
in February. Its important for 
CMU to have a good show of stu
dents at the Job Fair in order to 
receive a large volume of employ
ers, said Lehoczky, The H&SS Job 
Fair is not quite up to the Technical 
Conference, but we hope it will be 
soon.
Lehoczky said he also wants to 
work to develop the Humanities 
initiatives that Peter Stearns has 
worked for. CMU needs to build 
on this endeavor to foster the 
humanities and sustain the devel
opments, he said.
Professor Robyn Dawes is chair of 
the committee in search of a dean 
to fill this position permanently. 
While Lehoczky is not involved in 
the selection process, every depart
ment has a representative on the

Pipe repairs 
continue
by Krissy Choi
Staffwriter
Students passing by Doherty Hall 
this week probably noticed the 
extensive digging taking place on 
the Cut. This is due to replacing a 
pipe that was originally installed in 
the mid 1960's. According to Steven 
Guenther, Project Manager of the 
Facilities Management Services 
(FMS), a section of the campus sys
tem is being replaced to provide 
steam to Warner Hall. The pipe 
developed a leak during the fall 
semester and was repaired with a 
temporary patch.
Considering that section of the 
pipe [between CFA lawn and 
Purnell Center] is more than 30 
years old, we did some additional 
testing during the temporary patch 
work. Based oh the results, we 
decided that the pipe is approaching 
the end of its life and should be 
replaced, said Guenther.
FMS said that the new steam pipe 
is a preinsulated pipe system that 
will provide more protection from 
corrosion and, as a result, will have 
a longer life. FMS predicted that the 
new pipe will last for 50 years. FMS 
has taken advantage of the steam 
line project to incorporate present 
needs as well as the needs of the 
future. For example, the pipe size is 
being enlarged to accommodate 
increased steam demands of future 
renovations and construction.

New planning 
ideas introduced
by Laine Towey
Staffwriter
On Tuesday, January 18, a sec
ond Master Plan meeting was held 
in Rangos Ballroom. This meeting 
was primarily an update on how 
the current Carnegie Mellon 
Master Plan, which focuses on 
campus construction and develop
ment, is progressing. Several new 
ideas were proposed such as new 
dormitories, shuttles, and parking 
solutions. Students from the 
Campus Master Plan class in the 
School- of Architecture gave the 
meeting a more student-focused 
feel by revealing their suggestions 
for improving the Master Plan 
process.
Adam Gross, from the architec
tural firm of Ayers/Saint/Gross, 
which is responsible for consulting 
work on the Master Plan, spoke 
first to update the audience on the 
consultants observations concern
ing the impending campus con
struction. Tonight will be much 
more focused, Gross stressed, 
mentioning the need to connect 
Carnegie Mellon to the outside 
neighborhoods surrounding it, as 
well as to create a more collegetown atmosphere on South Craig 
Street.
Bob Kobet, a special consultant 
on campus ecology, then discussed 
how planning the environmental 
aspects of the new construction 
will also play a large part in the 
Master Plan. Kobet mentioned 
energy conservation, resource effi
ciency, transportation, and recy
cling among the issues that cam
pus ecology programs deal with.
Kevin Lamb, director of 
Planning for CMU, stresses the
importance of hiring an environ
mental consulting firm to aid in 
the campus planning process: We 
want to make sure we control the 
kind of planning we have.... We 
want to be mindful of how to do 
our landscaping in ways that can 
be economical for us and good for 
the environment.
Carnegie Mellon students were 
represented by members of the 
Campus Master Plan class, who 
spoke next and offered rec.32: 
thirty-two recommendations to 
the architects that had been sug
gested by members of the CMU 
community in a survey available at 
the official Master Plan Web site.

CMU student receives 
Rhodes Scholarship
by Anwesha Rakshit
Staffwriter
As only the second student in 
Carnegie Mellon history to acheive 
the prestigious Rhodes scholar
ship, Cindi Dennis will have the 
opportunity to obtain her graduate 
degree in physics at Oxford 
University.
Dennis, a senior in physics and 
computer science, won the schol
arship this year. The Rhodes schol
arship provides funding for two to 
three years of study at Oxford 
University in England.
The citeria for receiving the 
scholarship are based on what is 
set in the will of Cecil Rhodes, a 
British philanthropist. The criteria 
include high academic acheivement, integrity of character, a spir
it of unselfishness, respect for oth
ers, potential for leadership and 
physical vigor.
Dennis seemed to excel in all of
these fields. She has already won 
numerous awards, such as valedic
torian of her high school class, the 
Barry M. Goldwater Scholarship 
for Excellence in Education, and 
the Intel Women in Science and 
Engineering Scholarship.
When asked about how compli
cated the process was, Dennis 
explained that there were two lev
els of interviews to receive the 
scholarship  the state level and 
the district level. One can apply to 
the Rhodes board based upon 
either the state where you have 
gone to college for two or more 
years or the state of residency. All 
50 states are then grouped into 
eight districts from which four 
Rhodes Scholar Elects are chosen.
The process begins when the 
applicants send in their applica
tions at the beginning of October. 
The committee selects 10-20 
people to call back. That's all 
that they can interview in the

European Union still 
without military Force
STRASBOURG, France (AP)  
Once an exclusive economic club 
irtterested mainly in improving con
tinental trade, the European Union 
is1 pursuing plans for a military arm 
Capable of dispatching tens of thou
sands of troops to hot spots on short 
notice.
The generals are ready. Putting 
together a rapid reaction corps able 
to deploy 50,000-60,000 troops, 
hundreds of aircraft, and more than 
a dozen warships within 60 days is 
exciting stuff for soldiers.
Politically, however, much 
remains to be done. Parliaments still 
have to come up with the money, 
and choices have to be made on who 
will contribute what.
..EU leaders decided at their sum
mit last month that the force should 
be ready by 2003. They made provi
sions for political and military com
mittees similar to NATO and a mili
tary staff, with interim bodies to 
begin operating by March.
, The easy bit is making the deci
sion, said Andrew Brookes, an ana
lyst at London's International 
Institute for Strategic Studies. The 
hard bit is putting it into practice.
; The United States is watching 
closely. Although the Europeans 
irisist this is not an effort to under
mine the 19-nation NATO and push 
the Americans out of 
X Europe, the idea for an EU mili
tary force arises from a desire to be 
ble to work without the United 
(states in certain circumstances and 
to free themselves from U.S. domi
nation in NATO.
With the collapse of the Soviet 
bloc, the menace of continental con
flagration has receded. But that has 
been replaced by new dangers  
gnawing violence on the periphery, 
like the conflicts in Bosnia and 
Kosovo. The EU's idea is not to cre
ate a new standing army but to orga
nize and train rapid reaction forces 
in individual countries, ready to 
move out at short notice under a 
multinational headquarters.
A European force exists already. It 
is called Eurocorps and its head
quarters is in Strasbourg under the 
command of Spanish Lt. Gen. Juan 
Ortuno.
In reality, however, Eurocorps is a 
Cold War dinosaur burdened with 
heavy armored and mechanized 
units prepared to defend against a 
Soviet attack across central Europe. 
But its 1,200-man headquarters 
could be transformed for rapid reac
tion operations.
The main obstacle always will be 
money," said Ortuno. It is one thing 
for the European Council to take the 
decision. It is another thing having 
the national budgets increased in 
the amounts needed to confront 
these decisions.
The NATO summit in Washington 
last April approved a plan to 
upgrade NATO forces by making 
them faster, tougher and more effi
cient and improving their logistical 
support. Many requirements of that 
fit nicely into plans for the EU force, 
but so far the legislatures of NATO 
members haven't made any bud
getary commitments.
To be brutally frank, domestic 
politics makes it easier to do with 
the EU badge, said Richard 
Hatfield, policy director for the 
British Ministry of Defense.
Lord Robertson, the NATO secre
tary-general, said despite the fact 
that more than 2 million are under 
arms in Europe, sending 50,000 sol
diers to Kosovo consumed virtually 
every rapid reaction unit available.
Gen. Jean-Pierre Kelche, chief of 
staff of the French armed forces, 
insists it is not a matter of availabil
ity, but readiness.
There are no new units to cre
ate, he said. The resources exist. 
The problem is to get them all into a 
similar condition of availability and 
operational capacity. There is an 
effort to be made, but its not a 
mountain. These same forces, he 
stressed, are available both to the 
EU and NATO.'
Some believe there is no real mil
itary reason for an EU force because 
NATO already has provisions for 
Europe-only military actions within 
the alliance's framework.
For what kind of situations do 
we think of using it? asked Dick 
Leurdijk, a NATO expert at the 
Clingendael Institute in The 
Netherlands.
What kind of operations are 
related only to the European Union 
as such? Where do we draw the 
geographic line? And there is the 
fundamental question of whether it 
is wise to add a separate European 
dimension to what we have in 
NATO.

Gore leads in 
Iowa, N.H. poll
WASHINGTON (AP)  A1 Gore 
has a strong lead over Bill Bradley in 
Iowa polls just days before the 
state's presidential caucuses, while 
several New Hampshire polls indi
cate Gore has an edge over Bradley 
in a very close Democratic contest.
Recent polls in Iowa have given 
Gore more than a 20-point edge and 
a new survey in Iowa gave him an 
even larger lead, 63 percent to 26 
percent, over the former New Jersey 
senator.
For the Republicans, Texas Gov. 
George W. Bush has been about 20 
points or more ahead of Steve 
Forbes in recent Iowa polls.
The Iowa caucuses are Monday 
and the New Hampshire primary is 
Feb. 1.
Arthur Miller, director of the 
Heartland Poll, said previously
undecided voters now were picking 
Gore by a 2-1 margin. And Gores 
advantage over Bradley on handling 
the economy has more than doubled 
from a 15-point difference in late 
summer to more than a 35-point dif
ference now.
Seton Hall dorm 
fire leaves 3 dead
(U-WIRE) HANOVER, N.H.  
Three students died and 58 others 
were injured, six critically, after fire 
and smoke ravaged a Seton Hall 
University dormitory filled with 
sleeping students early Wednesday 
morning.
While the cause of the tragic fire 
in New Jersey is still under investi
gation, the blaze itself was con
tained in a lounge, where two of the 
three students were killed. Initial 
student response to the fire alarm 
was slow because 18 false alarms 
had previously been triggered since
September, according to The 
Associated Press.
The tragedy featured a few stu
dents jumping from windows and 
others blackened from smoke. 
Classes have been canceled for the 
rest of the week.
While smoke detectors and fire 
extinguishers were installed in the 
48-year-old dorm, a sprinkler sys
tem was not mandated by law at the 
time of the construction.
Director of Residential Operations 
at nearby Dartmouth Woody Eckels 
said he assumes the lack of sprin
klers is responsible for the extent of 
the damage because loss of life is 
unusual when a sprinkler system is 
in place.
At Dartmouth, 19 of the 66 under
graduate buildings on campus are 
currently not equipped with sprin
klers. According to Eckels, a budget
ing plan that began in 1992 stipulat
ed the addition of sprinkler systems 
in each renovated building, a goal 
five more years from realization.World News
Ten killed in 
border clash
JAMMU, India (AP)  India and 
Pakistan traded gunfire and accusa
tions Saturday, each blaming the 
other for an attack along their dis
puted Kashmir border that left as 
many as 10 people dead and vil
lagers scurrying for safety.
The head of the Indian armys 
northern command, Maj. Gen. P.P.S. 
Bindra, said seven Pakistani soldiers 
were shot dead when they attacked 
an Indian army post in the 
Himalayan territory, which is divid
ed between the two South Asian 
rivals. He said two Indian soldiers 
and an Indian civilian were also 
killed.
But Pakistan said it was the 
Indians who crossed the disputed 
Kashmir border and attacked a 
long-existing Pakistani post.
Both nations claim Kashmir in its 
entirety. In the latest fighting, 12 
Pakistani soldiers were wounded, 
Bindra said.
They came and attacked our 
post, and killed one junior commis
sioned officer and one soldier in the 
initial attack. We retaliated, Bindra 
told The Associated Press by tele
phone from his base in the town of 
Udhampur.
Israeli president 
wont resign
JERUSALEM (AP)  President 
Ezer Weizman said Sunday he is 
determined not to resign from 
office, despite the launching of a 
criminal investigation into allega
tions that he did not properly report 
cash gifts from a former business 
associate.
In his statement, which lasted just
over a minute, Weizman rejected 
calls that he take a leave of absence 
while the investigation is underway. 
That move, a step short of resigning, 
had been proposed as a compro
mise.
There is no difference between a 
president in office and one on 
leave, Weizman said. He repeated 
his declaration of innocence, adding 
only that if he made a mistake, it 
was a human mistake ... with the 
best of intentions.
Hawkish opposition legislators 
had criticized Weizman before the 
scandal broke last month for his 
active involvement in the peace 
process, saying he was damaging 
the integrity of the presidency. 
Police formally launched their 
criminal investigation into the 
case Sunday  the first time in 
Israels history that police have 
begun such a probe against a pres

taking down the Old Student 
Center, giving the UC more to the 
students, and improving the green 
spaces on campus.
Members of the class then spoke 
individually, highlighting different 
sections of rec.32. Transportation 
issues were discussed, such as the 
need for more reliable shuttles. The 
students offered solutions for the 
current parking problem; subter
ranean lots under the Doherty 
apartments were suggested as a 
viable alternative to more ashphalt.
The idea of increasing green space 
on the campus was also mentioned, 
as well as the need to retain what 
green space is available already, a 
major concern among many CMU 
students.
A question-and-answer period fol

Advertising inundates CMU
During the first week of classes, students 
encountered more than the usual campusproduced advertisements for online book
stores and other college-related enterprises.
Several campus representatives, stu
dents who have signed up to promote a 
company on campus, or want the benefits of 
referring somebody else to the company, 
have abused their position in the campus 
community, and their actions should not be 
tolerated.
In addition to handing out flyers and 
using other legitimate means of advertising, 
these campus representatives have slipped 
flyers under dormitory doors, spammed 
electronic bulletin boards and class dlists, 
chalked advertisements onto classroom 
blackboards, and postered on top of oncampus CMU flyers.
Some instances of this advertising violate 
University Policies. Using personal email 
accounts for outside advertising purposes 
without permission from Computing 
Services, sending mass emails, postering 
excessively, and postering for non-campus 
organizations are all violations of these poli
cies. While students should stop these 
behaviors, those who enforce the policies 
should take decisive steps to ensure that vio
lators are punished.
In addition, such advertising is an obnox
ious use of students access to campus 
forums. CMU is a community as well as an 
institution. Bringing commercial elements 
into a non-commercial arena violates the 
spirit of this community and clutters up 
forums that are meant to serve legitimate 
University business. Chalking sidewalks and 
postering, for example, take away space 
that should be used for campus business. 
Student clubs and organizations that use 
these methods to promote their own activi
ties are doing so with the purpose of enrich
ing the community. Businesses, however, 
are solely trying to make money.
Finally, by invading non-commercial cam
pus forums; companies may be actually 
hurting their own business. Students are far 
less inclined to patronize businesses whose 
advertising becomes an annoyance or an 
interference. By harassing our campus with 
excessive and inappropriate advertising, 
students hurt the credibility of the business
es they represent.
Being part of the University is a privilege. 
By abusing that privilege for personal gain, 
students violate both the rules and the spir
it of our community. Students should refuse 
to participate in and patronize these busi
nesses, and administrators should do their 
best to enforce policies against these forms 
of advertising.
Half-day cheapens holiday
On the first day of classes this semester, 
the University commemorated Martin 
Luther King Jr. Day with a half-day remem
brance. To give any recognition of this hol
iday is an improvement over previous 
years, and the activities planned were 
valuable to the community. However, a 
half-day off is still inadequate for a leading 
university in the United States. The admin
istration needs to correct this long stand
ing failure of the school and honor Martin 
Luther King Jr. with a full day off.
For several years the University has 
struggled with the appropriate manner in 
which to celebrate MLK Day. When this 
years graduating seniors arrived, there 
wasnt even a half-day of celebration for 
the civil rights leader. Recently, the admin
istration adopted the half-day solution to 
correct the oversight. The solution is an 
acquiescence to the demand for recogni
tion of King, but it demonstrates only a 
grudging acceptance of the holiday  as if 
it were only half worthy of our attention.
President Cohon has helped increase the 
amount of attention paid to diversity at 
Carnegie Mellon, but we are still well 
behind national norms for gender and racial 
diversity. In his speech last Monday, Cohon 
said that diversity isnt just in numbers, it is 
in culture. But what kind of culture are we 
cultivating where Martin Luther King Jr. is 
only half remembered?
In spite of the administrations refusal to 
entertain a full holiday to remember MLK, 
the organizers of the half-days events did
an excellent job of offering valuable and 
substantive events commemorating King. 
By engaging the University at many differ
ent levels, and including members of the 
Pittsburgh community, the organizers suc
cessfully enriched the campus. An example 
is the creative writing and poetry reading 
contest that was so well-attended that 
extra chairs had to be added. There is an 
interest in such activities, and everyone on 
campus should take a more active role in 
attending them. Given a full-day, students 
would be better able to explore the mean
ing of MLK Day.
One drawback to the days events, 
which was beyond the organizers con
trol, was that the activities fell on the first 
day of classes, when many students were 
trying to settle in and prepare for a new 
semester. The administration should 
avoid such clashes with the semester 
schedule. There is no question that stu
dents themselves must take a more active 
role in attending MLK Day activities. 
However, they would be more capable of 
doing this if they had the whole day to 
focus on the holiday.
With the success of event organizers and 
the late start to the school year aside, the 
time has come for the university to fully 
recognize King. Our current situation 
needs to be rectified. Most future Spring 
semesters will probably not start on MLK 
Day, but even in the rare event that they do 
the University should fully recognize this 
holiday.
The Tartan unveils redesign
It is with great excitement that the 2000 
Tartan editorial board releases the first 
redesign of The Tartan in over 10 years. Last 
semester, an in-house committee worked to 
update the look and improve the content of 
Carnegie Mellons longest-running student 
newspaper.
The main area of development has been 
the back section of the paper. The Arts and 
Living section is dedicated to cultural events 
in and around CMU, as well as campus living. 
Readers can find reviews and previews on 
such things as movies, concerts, restaurants, 
and music in our Entertainment section. 
Finally, two new sections will alternate week
ly to provide expanded coverage of Science &
Technology and Business. With these two 
sections we seek to build upon CMUs 
strengths as a research-driven science uni
versity, as well as the increased awareness of 
students in personal finance and economics.
All these efforts are aimed at expanding 
our coverage of news and events that are of 
interest to our readers. We are continually 
working to reinvent The Tartan to better 
serve the community. Keep an eye out for 
the release of our newly-improved Web site . 
at the end of this semester. As we work to 
develop the new paper, we appreciate any 
feedback that our readers have to offer 
about our decisions. Please e-mail us at tartan@andrew.cmu.edu.

Letters to the Editor
Morpheus visits library
Editor:
I was pleased to see your praise of Hunt 
Library as a place to sleep. The Roy A. Hunt 
Foundation recently provided a gift that 
was used to purchase new furnishings for 
the Hunt Reserve Reading area. Last year,
students had made numerous complaints 
about the worn-out furniture and poor 
arrangement. Three architecture students 
had studied it and made recommendations 
on how to improve it.
Last week I sent an illustrated thank 
you letter to the Hunt children and 
grandchildren who are the foundations 
trustees.The attached photo showed four
students studying and one sleeping. It is 
good to know that the Libraries prepare 
students for academic success, whether it 
is through quiet study, group work, or 
the well-documented benefits of power 
naps.
Gloriana St Chair 
University LibrarianStudent condemns Asian lobby
Timothy Lo
With the primaries in full swing and the 
New Hampshire vote coming up in 
February, interest groups have been push
ing for candidates to commit to different 
causes. Among them is a political action 
committee called 80-20, sponsored by 
many Asian-American organizations 
including the Organization of Chinese 
Americans. In essence, the 80-20 program 
offers any candidate 80 percent of the 
Asian-American vote as long as he promis
es to install an Asian-American in the exec
utive and judicial branch upon being elect
ed. Several weeks ago, Bill Bradley 
revealed his ignorance by being the only 
candidate to accept 80-20s proposal.
It is the duty of all citizens to vote in all 
elections, both local and national. 
However, it is necessary to vote intelligent
ly and with a purpose. The 80-20 program 
is bunk. It not only shows true mindless
ness on behalf of those who vote only for 
the purpose of promoting the 80-20 pro
gram, but also will prove to be dangerous 
as other agendas and important issues that
concern the well-being of our nation 
become subordinated to the one-tracked 
mindset of promoting Asian-Americans, or 
any minority group, in government.
In his letter to the Asian-American 
Community, S. B. Woo, spokesperson for 
the 80-20 initiative, warned that by not 
demonstrating the strength of the Asian 
American population, they are dooming 
themselves to remain permanent secondclass citizens.
Asian-Americans have not been secondclass citizens for the past thirty years. In 
fact, according to the census bureau, AsianAmericans are on average the most educat
ed and wealthy class of people in America. 
It wouldnt be true to the facts of history to 
compare the Asian-American situation to 
that of the African-American or womens 
movement. Asian-Americans did not have 
to drink at separate water fountains or sit 
at the back of the bus. There is no glass ceil
ing to break through in the corporate 
world. In fact, Asian-Americans are often 
overqualified and thus hurt by affirmative 
action.
There is no doubt that racism exists. 
However, the key to fighting racism is not 
to install an Asian-American in office by 
means of coercion, or threat, or even empty
promise  it lies in education: educating 
our children, and especially adults, in val
ues that are right, fair, and just.
Asian-Americans are not prevalent in 
politics simply because there isnt enough 
interest. In fact, Asian-American represen
tation in Congress is proportional to the 
percentage of Asian-Americans in the gen
eral population. In addition to this, AsianAmerican voter turnout is pitiful. Their 
voter turnout lies just above that of 
teenagers. As shocking as this may sound, 
it is true.
The efforts of the Asian-American associ
ations are commendable; however, it is 
essential to tread lightly and carefully to 
assure that the first step toward a national 
awareness of Asian-American strength and 
contribution is the right step, one that will 
not cause Asian-Americans to be branded 
as rabble-rousers.
Asian-Americans have demonstrated 
their strengths through economic and 
social means. If they dont put thought into 
how they vote in the next election, they do 
more damage than good to their political 
strength.

and public policy major.

In cased you missed it over the winter 
break, John Rocker, star relief pitcher for 
the Atlanta Braves, triggered outrage 
throughout the country when he blasted 
foreigners, minorities, homosexuals, AIDS 
patients, single mothers, and the city of 
New York in last Decembers issue of Sports 
Illustrated. He told Jeff Pearlman, writer for 
Sports Illustrated, that he would rather 
retire than play for a New York team. 
Rocker then added:
Imagine having to take the [Number] 7 
train to the ballpark, looking like youre 
riding through Beirut next to some kid with 
purple hair, next to some queer with AIDS, 
right next to some dude.who just got out of 
jail for the fourth time, right next to some 
20-year-old mom with four kids. Its 
depressing.
Asians and Koreans and Vietnamese and 
Indians and Russians and Spanish people 
and everything up there. How the hell did 
they get in this country?
Also, during the interview, he lashed out 
at a black teammate by calling him a fat 
monkey. While watching a car whip back 
and forth between lanes, he shouted, I 
guarantee you shes a Japanese woman ... 
How bad are Asian women at driving?
On December 22nd, the Braves released 
a statement that they claimed to be the 
words of Rocker. The statement, read by 
Braves general manager John Schuerholz 
stated:
My emotions fuel my competitive 
desire. I have gone way too far in my com
petitive zeal. I have let my emotions get the 
better of my judgement and have said
cocaine for the second time in his career, 
the Mets released a statement that they 
claimed had been written by Gooden. The 
statement contained an apology to his 
club, his teammates, and his fans and 
thanked everyone for their support. In 
his 1999 autobiography, Heat, Gooden 
confessed, I didnt write a word of it, 
nor was I in the mood to thank anyone 
for anything.
The Atlanta Braves Organization, like 
the 1994 New York Mets, may have 
fooled the entire nation. The John 
Rocker that baseball fans all over the 
country know is too arrogant and stub
born to realize the controversy that his 
|brainless remarks had sparked across 
the country. If he had written that 
statement, then why didnt he come 
out and apologize to the public himself 
rather than having Schuerholz read it? 
The reason is. because at that time, no 
one could convince the thick-headed 
Rocker to come out and admit that he 
Im shocked that I have not Matthew eium/Art staff was wrong the next best thing
heard one sportswriter or fan that has, in 
any way, doubted that Rocker had anything 
to do with that apology.
Does the apology released by the Atlanta 
Braves in any way resemble the words of 
the imbecile who, out of pure stupidity, 
permanently marked himself as New Yorks 
most hated athlete, by calling all Met fans 
stupid and a tired act? Or the words of 
a one-man psycho circus who spit at fans 
and gave them the finger? Richard Roeper 
of the Chicago Sun-Times said it best when 
he stated, Im more inclined to believe the 
real Rocker is the guy quoted in the SI story 
as yelling at a motorist: You stupid bitch! 
Learn to f- drive! 
On June 24th, 1994, after Dwight 
Gooden, pitcher for the New York Mets at 
that time, had been tested positive for
that the Braves could do is to get a ghost
writer to write that statement and have 
Schuerholz read it and separate the organi
zation from Rocker by claiming that 
Rockers viewpoints in no way represent 
those of the Atlanta Braves organization. 
John Rockers first real public appearance 
since the release of the Sports Illustrated 
article was in an interview with Peter 
Gammons released on January 13 by ESPN, 
where Rocker claimed that his words had 
been misinterpreted and that he was not a 
racist. Peter Gammons said afterwards that 
he still wasnt convinced that Rocker knew 
what a public outcry he had caused. The 
nitwit hadnt realized what he had stirred 
up even after three weeks of fans canceling 
season tickets, his teammates turning

---------------------------------------------------

THE TARTAN  JANUARY 24, 20007
Presidential nomination boasts several losers
John Rockers prejudiced statements damaging to self, Braves
ROCKER, from page 6
against him, and groups all over the country 
advocating his release from the Braves and 
even his removal from baseball?
In Rockers interview with Gammons, he 
made one statement that made little sense to 
me: You hit one home run in the big leagues, 
it doesnt make you a home-run hitter. To 
make one comment like this doesnt make you 
a racist. Unfortunately, this was not just one 
comment nor was this equivalent to just one 
home run in the big leagues. This was a bar
rage of the most ignorant and racist hate 
remarks ever recorded by an athlete.
There have been mixed reactions among his 
teammates about Rocker. Bruce Chen, team
mate of Chinese descent, stands by his long
time friend by saying that Rocker has treated 
him and his parents well throughout their 
friendship. On the flip side, Randall Simon, 
teammate who is both blaqk and LatinAmerican, claims that Rocker has no rela
tionships with the black guys or the Latin guys 
on the team. Simon said to the Associated 
Press, Hes lying to try and cover himself.
John Rocker claimed that he was simply 
firing back at the fans in New York for spit
ting in his face, throwing batteries at him, 
making obscene remarks about his mother, 
and pouring beer on his uniform. I have been 
to Shea Stadium, home of the New York Mets, 
countless times in my life and from my experi
ence, at least half of the fans who participate 
in those actions are Caucasians as well as 
minorities. Assuming that he is not a racist, 
what makes little sense to me is why his 
method of retaliating against the people of 
New York is by attacking the foreigners, 
minorities, homosexuals, and single mothers 
when half the fans that he targets dont even 
belong in that population. Bruce Chens state
ments on ESPN about Rockers kind hospitali
ty towards him convince me that Rocker is not 
a flaming racist, but its hard to argue that he 
does not have any racial prejudice in him. On 
top of telling them that they dont belong in 
this country, how much more does a man have 
to bash foreigners and minorities to be con
sidered a racist? The greatest Rocker debate 
of them all is what form of action should 
Major League Baseball and the Braves take
upon Rocker. The only possibilities are ban
ishment from baseball, release from the 
Atlanta Braves, a temporary suspension from 
baseball, a fine, psychological treatment, or a 
combination of them.
Major League Baseball cannot and will not 
ban John Rocker from the game. If Bud Selig, 
commissioner of MLB, permanently ousts 
Rocker from Baseball, the Players Association 
will sue MLB to death in the courts. Selig 
already has enough problems on his hands 
trying to get low-revenue teams in contention 
and trying to avoid the possibility of a labor 
strike of the players union in a couple years, 
not to mention Pete Roses non-stop nagging 
to be reinstated. There is a rule against gam
bling on baseball, theres a rule on taking 
drugs while in baseball, but unfortunately, 
there is no rule against being an idiot or being 
a racist in baseball. So, John Rocker will con
tinue his career whether or not its as a Brave.
The Braves will not release John Rocker. At 
worst, he will be traded. John Schuerholz is 
smart enough to know that some team some
where is willing to give something up for the 
star lefty. Just how good is he? How many 
other good pitchers not named Billy Wagner 
or Randy Johnson can throw a 100 miles-perhour fastball from the left side? During the 
1999 National League Championship Series, 
the presence of John Rocker in the Braves 
bullpen forced Bobby Valentine, manager of 
the New York Mets and one of the most arro
gant managers out there, to switch around his 
lineup, one that he had held for almost the 
whole regular season. The NBC broadcaster 
even named it, The Rocker Effect. In the 
1999 regular season, he struck out 104 hitters 
in 72 1/3 innings and had 38 saves and was 
arguably one of the top 5 closers in the game. 
In addition, hes only 25, and hes making 
$217,500, a tad over the league minimum. 
Any team could use him out of the bullpen 
and any team can afford him. And consider
ing the low quality of Major League pitching 
today, he has one of the most sought-after 
arms out there. The Braves would be idiots to 
release him and get nothing for him.
A suspension and fine are the most plausi
ble options for Rocker. I never did understand 
the logic of fines in baseball. In 1997, Albert
Belle was fined $5,000 for making an obscene 
gesture to Indians fans at Jacobs Field. Heres 
a man who had just signed a contract worth 
$55 million and for some reason, baseball 
thought that it was teaching Belle a lesson by 
fining him $5,000. Since Rocker is only mak
ing $217,500, this may have an effect on him. 
If Belle gets charged $5,000 for giving the fin
ger to fans, Rocker should get at the very least 
that much of a fine. A suspension of Rocker 
only delays the real punishment to come 
which would be facing his teammates, oppo
nents, and the fans of not only New York and 
Atlanta but in every ballpark, once again.
Sportswriters all over America have beaten 
to death the issue of Selig ordering psycholog
ical testing of John Rocker. They all seem to 
agree that its a ridiculous idea to believe that 
he has mental problems. I have nothing new 
to add to this and theres no point for me to go 
any further in this issue when you can you can 
read the same thoughts in any newspaper.
The Atlanta Braves cannot blame John 
Rocker for the mess that they are in now. 
They were well aware of the overly aggressive 
and unpredictable nature of Rockers compet
itiveness well before he blasted away in Sports 
Illustrated. Looking at how he became New 
Yorks most hated athlete in a matter of weeks, 
his mouth was bound to explode sooner or 
later. And the Braves did nothing to control it. 
In fact, if the Adanta Braves have anyone to 
blame, it should be Bobby Cox, manager of 
the Atlanta Braves. Bobby Cox said to 
reporters again and again during the 1999 
NLCS that he would talk to Rocker about his 
behavior. But Rocker revealed in the Sports 
Illustrated article, Bobby never talked to me 
about it, and I never talked to him. Why 
would he? We were winning.
Theres nothing that Major League Baseball 
or the Atlanta Braves can do that can further 
discipline Rocker. The public has already 
punished him, and the worst is yet to come. 
Punishment is your parents forced into chang
ing their number twice because of endless 
calls against their child. Punishment is you 
and your family fearing for your life and safe
ty in any place you go to work from now on. 
Punishment is having to hide in the back of a 
van for hours to avoid reporters. Punishment
is having to face your opponents again after 
you have offended all of them, most of whom 
already hated you. Punishment is having to 
take the center stage in New York when most 
of the city is after your head. Punishment is 
being kicked out of a New Orleans bar on the 
eve of the millennium because the bar crowd 
found out your identity. Punishment is fans 
chanting AHOLE before you even walk on 
the field. Punishment is hundreds of groups 
pressuring your organization to fire you and 
never let you back. Punishment is your col
leagues turning against you and requesting 
that you be fired. Punishment is having some
one make money off a web site devoted to hat
ing you (www.rockersucks.com). Punishment 
is a rock band (Twisted Sister) refusing that 
their song be played in your presence. 
Punishment is being named as jerk of the 
week on www.jerkoftheweek.com. 
Punishment is hearing the mayor of your 
hometown apologize to the city of New York 
for your behavior. Banishment from baseball 
would relieve Rocker of the worst conse
quences of his brainless actions, and a suspen
sion would just delay them. John Rocker will 
have to wear his name on the back of his uni
form for the rest of his career. The fans and 
media will take it from there.
In the ESPN interview, Peter Gammons 
asked Rocker whether his life will ever be the 
same again. Rocker answered, Sure. I have 
reason to believe otherwise. Dwight Gooden 
was on the verge of becoming one of the 
greatest pitchers ever to play the game until 
he tested positive for cocaine in 1987 and then 
again in 1994. Drug addict has since been 
imprinted on his name. Wil Cordero was one 
of the hottest young stars until he was con
victed of assaulting his wife a few years ago. 
Since then, his career has never been the same 
and he has been labeled as the wife-beater. 
John Rocker has offended a large segment of 
America. He has also offended all the base
ball fans of New York, a people who never for
get. Even if Major League Baseball takes no 
action on John Rocker, he has already 
destroyed his career.

Stockpiling food, living in bomb shelters, 200 gallons of water  does that 
sound like a CMU student's vacation? To find out, we asked the question:
things at all the correct times and poses with all the correct 
people, which I could almost understand in a presidential 
campaign, but when he delivers these lines with the conviction 
of a sponge, you have to wonder whether he actually believes 
what hes saying. I can almost see the Democratic establish
ment pulling the strings. Hes like Clinton but with better 
ethics, really!
In a way, its understandable that both Gore and Bush 
should think it perfectly acceptable to run for President with
out any ideals but the ones they are told to have. Both are professional politicians named after fathers who were also profes
sional politicians, and who grew up in a political world. As 
such, they are political creatures, and it shows. But knowing 
this, are we as a nation really going to let them get away with 
it? Are we, for lack of anyone better in the major parties, 
going to hand over the country to a man who upholds 
whichever ideals suit his handlers at the moment?
Elsewhere, the field is equally bare; the assorted other 
Republicrats may yet overtake Gore or Bush, but they have yet 
to demonstrate that theyre more than slightly better. Of the 
independent parties, the strongest is once again the Reform 
party, fielding Pat Buchanan, who certainly must have a penis, 
and Donald Trump, who probably has several, some plated 
with gold. I consider both of these candidates to be jokes, and 
I hope for the sake of the country that you do, too. Pat 
Buchanan is the sort of guy who makes moderate conserva
tives feel like whipping out a check for the ACLU. Hes into 
teaching creationism in schools and traditional 
values like harassing homosexuals who have the 
nerve to ask for legal protection from being beaten 
to death. The media loves to imply that hes a 
racist, and I wouldnt be surprised to find out that 
its true. However, Buchanan is at least a career 
demagogue; Trumps qualifications for the job are 
close to zero. He owns a lot of stuff. He wants 
Oprah as his running mate. And the other inde
pendents, some of whom may actually be quali
fied, havent the money or visibility to seriously 
challenge the major parties. What a circus! It 
would be funny if it werent so depressing. A scant 
ten months before the election, the candidates 
most likely to be elected are two androids and a 
guy who actually misses the Cold War. Its enough 
to make a girl want to vote for Optimus Prime.
Id like to ask the eight students on this campus 
Suissa/Art Editor who actually vote to do me a favor: Think about it. 
Whoever you vote for, dont be afraid to choose someone from 
a minor party, even if you think he (or she, maybe) cant win. 
Because if we stick within the obvious choices from the major 
parties, Im afraid we wont have much choice at all.

;______________________________________________Lorelei Laird
Remember Spiro Agnew? He was Richard Nixons vice pres
ident, and  heres the interesting part  when you rearrange 
the letters of his name, you get grow a penis. I think its safe 
to assume that both George W. Bush and A1 Gore, the anoint
ed candidates for the Republican and Democratic parties, 
respectively, have penises, although they havent set 
out to prove it like Clinton did. What they need to grow 
is personalities. Both seem to be purely the creations of 
their campaigns and their parties; neither has yet 
shown that he has an independent idea in his head. If 
these are the eventual major-party candidates, should 
Americans bother to vote?
On one side, we have George W. Bush, the G.O.P.s 
acknowledged golden boy, who nonetheless has more 
pedigree than poise. Everybody seems to love him and 
hes the Republican favorite in both New Hampshire 
and Iowa, according to recent polls. However, he does
nt seem to actually have any particular ideology.
Rather, he agrees that motherhood is good and satu
rated fat is bad, changes the subject, and then poses 
with hispanic children. This embodies his entire cam
paign strategy: As long as he expresses as few opinions 
as possible, he will keep the inexplicable adoration 
and millions of dollars that the entire Republican 
establishment has bestowed upon him. This strategy probably 
suits the G.O.P. just fine, especially since Bush tends to screw 
up when he does open his mouth. Hey, hes a people person, 
not one of those damned intellectuals.
On the other side, theres Al Gore, Jr., who has earned the 
nickname the Gorebot by campaigning with the sort of stiff
ness usually reserved for blind dates. He says all the correct

Blue Devils success in face of losses confounds writer
Full Court Press
by Pete Patterson
Going into this season, it looked 
like it was finally going to be a down 
year for the Duke Blue Devils. Other 
than the total collapse endured by 
the program in 1995 due to Coach 
Krzyzewskis absence on the bench 
as he missed the season after back 
surgery, the team has undoubtedly 
been the dominant team of the 90s. 
The decade began with back-toback titles in 91 and 92, and closed 
with a 37-2 record and runner-up 
finish in the tournament last year. 
With guard Trajan Langdon as the 
only senior on this dominant team, 
it appeared this year would be more 
of the same for the Devils.
Then strange things started to 
happen in Durham. It started off 
innocently enough, with sophomore 
forward Elton Brand declaring him
self eligible for the NBA draft. The 
move was entirely expected, as 
Brand was considered one of the top 
three draft prospects in the land (he 
ended up going to the Bulls as the 
number one pick), but was still a littjle unsettling to Duke fans. The rea
son for this is that Brand was the 
first player under Coach K to leave 
early for the pros. Grant Hill, 
Christian Laettner, Bobby Hurley, 
and Danny Ferry all resisted the lure 
of NBA dollars to stay in college for 
four years. The landscape of college 
basketball is different these days, 
though, and a team with as much 
talent as Duke couldnt be expected
to stay immune to the mass exodus 
of underclassmen to the NBA. 
Krzyzewski saw this, understood it, 
and even encouraged Brands leap 
to the pros.
believe had the necessary polish on 
his game to make the leap. Even 
more outrageously, freshman Corey 
Maggette then declared himself eli
gible for the draft after averaging a
these moves, and he didnt attempt 
to hide his feelings from the press.
All this turmoil and unrest caused 
Duke-haters to be excited with the 
anticipation of watching the Blue
The same cannot be said for what 
happened next. First, sophomore 
guard William Avery declared him
self ready for the draft. Avery was 
an excellent, but sometimes erratic, 
point guard who Krzyzewski didnt
mere 10 minutes a game as a firstyear player. Then, just to cap things 
off, projected starting power for
ward Chris Burgess announced that 
he was transferring from the pro

Adam Grossi/Art Staff
Devils struggle through the season. 
Fans in Chapel Hill, WinstonSalem, Atlanta, and every other 
ACC city would have liked nothing 
better than for their teams to kick 
Duke while they were down. The
year started off in an encouraging 
manner, with the Blue Devils 
matching their loss total from last 
year in two games with losses to 
Stanford and Connecticut. Then a 
funny thing began to happen. Duke 
started to win, win, and win some 
more. Quality opponents such as 
Depaul, USC, Michigan, and Illinois 
all fell to the recharged squad. After 
wins against NC State and Wake 
Forest last week, Duke has now 
ripped off 15 straight wins and is 
6-0 in the ACC. With no clear con
tender in the conference, another 
undefeated league record and a 
number-one NCAA seed are not out 
of the question.
How are they doing it? The key 
to Dukes play so far has been the 
leadership of senior Chris 
Carrawell and junior Shane Battier. 
Both are unselfish, versatile, and 
proud of their defense. The 66 
Carrawell has played every posi
tion on the floor during his career 
in Durham. While he doesnt have a 
great outside jumper, he can slash 
to the basket effectively and is one 
of the top on-the-ball defenders in 
the country. Most importantly, he 
is a great leader in the locker room 
and always puts achievement of 
team goals above seeking any indi
vidual accolades. Battier plays with 
a similar unselfishness, and is one 
of the most well-rounded inside 
players in the country. He will grab 
a tough board, take a charge, and 
can also step outside and hit the 
three. The leadership of these two,
along with fellow veteran Nate ; 
James, has eased the transition of; 
Dukes current crop of sensational 
freshmen. Point guard Jason;; 
Williams, forward Carlos Boozer, 
and swingman Mike Dunleavy Jr.' 
have all shown why they were! 
McDonalds All-Americans last; 
year, and have improved as the sea- <! 
son has progressed.
Unfortunately for all the Blue; 
Devil-bashers around, this team J 
shows no sign of slowing down. \ 
They appear only to be getting bet-1 
ter as the freshmen mature and ; 
adjust to the college game, and ; 
Battier and Carrawell will make  
sure the intensity level stays up. I i 
wouldnt start looking for a Final > 
Four ticket quite yet if I were a Blue I 
Devil fan, however. The team is 0 
very thin, as only six players aver-'{ 
age even ten minutes a game. One! 
key injury could be devastating.! 
The team is also still very young, 
and it remains to be seen how they > 
adjust to the intensity level of play-1 
ing in their first NCAA tourna-': 
ment. Teams such as UConn,,' 
Cincinnati, Stanford, and. 
Michigan State may have too much ! 
depth and talent for the Blue! 
Devils. Whatever happens, Duke', 
has shown by weathering adversity j; 
why they are the preeminent pro-: 
gram in all of college basketball.

Actual game runs distant second in Super Bowl spectacle
I Column as I See 'em
by Colt Foutz
By the soft amber glow of my 
Miller Lite Beer Pager, I can see that 
here are only six more days of 
processed snack food bliss left 
before we as United States sports 
fans are collectively doomed to the 
long and lonely period stretching 
from the day after the Super Bowl to 
what seems like infinity, until April 
; brings baseball and the blessed 
"scent of foot-long franks steamed 
fresh at the ballpark.
I say we are doomed because
the extra week that we used to have 
between the conference champi
onship games and the Super Bowl. 
Sure, some would argue that were 
getting the same amount of football, 
just with an extra bye week 
squeezed in, but I miss the hype that 
would build up over two weeks 
finally culminating in the ultimate 
hype-fest of them all, and here Im 
not even talking about the actual 
football game. No, if the Super Bowl 
were just a football game, would 
over 80 percent of the nations tele
vision sets be faithfully tuned in the 
final Sunday of every January? I
nothing goes better with a bag of 
pork rinds and a full frosted mug of 
beer quite like football, and after the., 
couch potatos equivalent of Holy 
Week passes when the New Years 
bowls are over, and the college 
national champion is decided, the 
final days of the NFL schedule tick 
by like a time bomb, bringing the 
devoted connoisseurs of the couch 
and Browns quarterback Tim Couch 
ever closer to our eventual sentenc
ing of blue lines and foul lines, and 
fat guys wearing plaid pants end
lessly stooping over to line up the 
perfect putt. Hockey, basketball, 
and golf may pass the time, but they 
dont exactly inspire you to loosen 
the headlock youve got on your lit
tle traitor Michigan fan brother long 
enough to shout, Facemask? Ill 
show you a facemask! Hey Dad, pass 
the popcorn.
So, its a safe bet to say that Ill be 
appropriately attired in black on 
January 30, wearing my Rod 
Wpodson Steelers jersey and eye 
black smeared under both eyes, 
preparing for the somber occasion 
like its Y2K all over again  stock
ing up on chips, chili dip, various 
meats in a wrapper, and enough 
beer to wash it all down. And while 
on Monday, it may seem obvious 
why Ill be squinting in the fluores
cent lighting and mumbling angrily 
to myself during my 8:30 class, 
dont sell me or my fellow footballholics short. Were in mourning for 
the next two months, so show some 
sympathy, please. Oh yeah, and pass 
the tissues while youre at it.
Call me sentimental, but I miss
Jamie Divine/Art Staff
dont think so. Take away the game 
and youve still got the Great 
American Music of the 20th Century 
Pre-game Show, the star-studded 
Disney Halftime Extravaganza, the 
commercials, the parties, the office 
pools, and enough snack food to 
bury the entire Presidents Council 
on Physical Fitness. And, of course, 
the Bud Bowl. Really, where would 
we as a nation be if we werent 
rewarded with the chance to wit
ness sweating beer bottles square 
off to decide the true King of 
Beers? Probably watching Pepsi 
and Coke do the same thing in sev
eral pricey commercial spots during 
the course of the game. Or Hertz 
and Thrifty. Or Nokia and Erricson. 
See? Hypefest!
Another disadvantage of having 
only a week to prepare for the Super 
Bowl  at least for a writer on dead
line  is that in order to predict my 
Super Bowl winner, Ive also got to 
correctly predict the winners of the 
conference championship games, 
which as I am writing this sentence 
have not yet been played. So, before 
I do that Ill outline a few ways that 
you, the reader, can maximize your 
time in preparing for the game this 
Sunday, and give myself some more 
time to think the actual football 
through.
For starters,1 check out 
http://www.superbowl.com. The site 
offers the usual breakdown of statis
tics and history, as well as links to 
the NFL and the Georgia Dome, site 
of this years game. But this year you 
can also download your very own 
Miller Lite Beer Pager, which func
tions as a desktop communications 
accessory, so you can send messages 
to your friends to better coordinate 
your Super Bowl party plans!
Some of the other features on the 
site are Super Bowl greeting cards 
which you can either send online or 
print up and mail, an old-style foot
ball game in the chirping red-dotted 
tradition of the hand-held age, and 
tips to make your Super Bowl party 
the best ever. One suggestion, sent 
in by Rose Delaney of Slidell, LA, is 
to have a TV in the bathroom so no 
one misses any of the action or com
mercials. Well, duh! The site also 
offers the diary of Leah Barker, wife 
of Jaguars punter Bryan Barker, 
who recorded some of her thoughts 
as her husbands team battled to the 
brink of the worlds greatest sport
ing event. Though the site claims 
this section was created for women 
by women, its really for any sports 
fan interested in the personalities 
behind the helmets.
Since this years tickets are basi
cally non-existent, and even if they 
were available would cost as much 
as one of my classes this semester (a 
worthwhile trade, perhaps?), you 
can experience some of the feeling 
of being at the game by pointing 
your web browser to 
http://www. tailgating.com. Here, 
the self-proclaimed commissioner 
of tailgating, Joe Cahn, tells his fas
cinating story. Four years ago Cahn 
sold his house and business, and 
since then has driven his mobile 
home to 67 cities around the coun
try to serve his famous jambalaya at 
stadiums both professional and 
bush league. Mr. Cahn will be park
ing his Joe Mobile in Atlanta this 
Sunday and you wont, so go to his 
site and see what the man has to say.
Of course, the big day wouldnt be 
complete without the battling beer 
bottles, and you can make it worth 
your while by logging on to 
http://www.espn.com and following 
the Bud Bowl link to try your luck at 
predicting this years score. Grand 
Prize is a trip to ESPN Studios in 
Bristol, Connecticut, and $1,000 in 
cash. Sportscenter anchor Stuart 
Scott hosts the site, which beats 
even the commissioner of tailgat
ings for football dementia. Hard to 
believe that the Bud Bowl has been 
around for almost as long as the ear
liest Super Bowl that I can remem
ber (Miami v. San Francisco, XIX). 
Well, theyve got the history here, 
as well as movie clips from famous 
Bud Bowl showdowns of the past. 
But, dont leave until you register to 
win!
On game day, experience the 
game in a new way by logging on to 
http://www.QBl.com, and predict 
the plays as they happen to win 
prizes. Funny, I thought interactive 
for the Super Bowl viewer would be 
singing and dancing along with Phil 
Collins and North Alleghenys own 
Christina Aguilera during the halftime show without spilling my beer. 
Well, maybe you can do that at this 
site, too.
Okay, so Ive done about as much 
for your Super Bowl preparations as 
I can without going out and filling 
your cart with my favorite munchies 
and stopping by your party Sunday 
night (you can page me on my beer 
pager at ff25+@andrew.cmu.edu\'). 
Of course, theres still the matter of 
my predictions for the football part 
of the big game, so Ill just get that 
over with now.
The thing about the NFL this year, 
as Ive kept telling my Monday Night 
Football friends repeatedly during 
the course of the season, is that its 
screwed up from top to bottom. In 
other words, the teams that usually 
win have lost, and the teams that 
you usually see languishing at 3-13 
and the bottom of the standings 
have come out like world-beaters. 
So, as my reasoning goes, even 
though Ive picked the correct score 
for most of the games this season, 
the actual game result has not
reflected this. See? The NFL is 
screwed up!
Keeping this in mind, I tried to 
find a way of predicting the winners 
of this weeks championship games 
whereby I would put less of my per
sonal opinions on the line. First, I 
tried playing the games on my 
ancient Sega video game system 
using Tecmo Super Bowl and Tecmo 
Super Bowl III. Well, that became a 
problem, since most of the players 
that are around now werent in the 
game in 1995, and I usually won by 
a score of 96-10. Probably not real
istic, even for the high octane St. 
Louis Rams. Next, I went shopping 
and came home with Madden 99. 
Well, the learning curve proved a lit
tle steeper than Id expected, and 
most of my games featured Mark 
Brunell of the Jaguars getting 
sacked for a net loss of around 70 
yards each game. So, Im right back 
where I started.
All right. This writer says that the 
Jaguars will beat the Titans for the 
first time this season in a close game
decided by the quarterbacks, and i 
that in the NFC St. Louis will roll; 
over the Buccaneers. On January1 
30, head coach Dick Vermeil of the { 
Rams will be drying his eyes as he J 
clutches the Vince Lombardi trophyf 
that he missed out on in 1980 with' 
the Eagles.
Colt Foutz would like to remind; 
everybody that these are, in fact, the;; 
correct picks, even if the games do not - 
reflect this.

Tartan women upset top ten ranked NYUMens teams tough stretch continues
by Brian Smith
Contributing Editor
Going into the weekend of 
January 14, the Carnegie Mellon 
womens basketball team had a 
record of 6-7, including 1-4 in the 
University Athletic Association 
(UAA). Since then, however, the 
squad has been on a tear, winning 
five straight, moving to 5-4 in UAA 
play and making their presence felt 
on a national scale.
After knocking off Brandeis 56-46 
at home, the Tartans faced UAA 
powerhouse New York University on 
January 16. The Violets had not lost 
' to CMU since the 1992-93 season 
and came in ranked seventh nation
ally in womens NCAA Division III 
play according to d2hoops.com.
Needless to say, the Tartans had 
their work cut out for them if they 
were to continue their winning 
streak.
The whole team wanted to win 
that game so badly, said head 
coach Gerri Seidl. There was no 
doubt in my mind we could win.
The Tartans shocked NYU on the 
strength of first-year business 
administration major Michelle 
Sodinis 10 consecutive points in the 
last 3:30, taking the score from 
51-43 to 53-51. It was the first 
Tartan lead since the 3:56 mark of 
the first half and the Tartans held on 
for their biggest upset in years  
54-51. Sodini and senior captain 
Kara Coval led the Tartans with 13 
points and Coval added nine 
rebounds.
After we actually won, it put us 
on a high that we didnt come down 
from until practice on Thursday, 
said Seidl. In addition to gaining 
respect on a national level, the 
Tartans made their presence felt by 
knocking NYU from their top 10 
ranking.
We believe we can compete with 
every UAA team, said Seidl. NYU 
proved that.
Coming off such a huge win, the 
Tartans were hyped for last Fridays 
game against Rochester. Less than a 
minute into the game, Coval 
drained a jump shot and essentially 
put the Tartans up for good, 2-0. 
While the first half was close, the 
result was never in dispute. After 20 
minutes of play, CMU held the 
advantage 27-22. Sodini lead the 
team with 10 points including two 
three-pointers.
In the first half, we tried to run a 
passing offense that we just put into
place last week, said Seidl, explain
ing why the halftime score differen
tial was only five points.
The team came out firing in the 
second half. Great passing, excep
tional defense, and an unbeatable 
full-court press made the 
Yellowjackets look like a high school 
junior varsity team. We needed 
something to spark us, said Seidl. 
The team gets sparked by the press 
and it worked well.
The score quickly grew insur
mountable for Rochester, and four 
minutes into the half CMU was up 
35-25. The Yellowjackets tried a 
press of their own but accurate pass
ing by junior Lauren Pertuzzi and 
Sodini busted it up and ran the score 
up even more. Rochester was forced 
to take a timeout with 14:51 left and 
the score 39-26.
CMU continued to roll for the rest 
of the game. With great passing, the 
team always found an open shot, 
and the Tartan sharp shooters made 
it count. First-year forward Christa 
Thomas drained nine of 15 field 
goals and tied Sodini as the days 
high scorer with 18 points. The 
game ended 76-51, giving the 
Tartans their fourth straight win.
We have to take one game at ,a 
time from here on in, said Seidl 
after the win. The next game for the 
Tartans came last Sunday at home 
against Case Western. Defense is 
always our key, she said before the 
Case game. If our defense is good, 
we will be unstoppable.
First-year students Erin Brady, 
Thomas, Sodini, Pertuzzi, and Coval 
all scored in double digits and the 
Tartans scored their second romp of 
the weekend, 73-51, evening out 
their UAA record at 44.
The best thing about this year is 
our combination of experience and 
talented youth, said Seidl. We can 
give the opposition a lot of different 
looks.
She also points to team unity and 
focus as factors in Tartan success. 
We have not had one distraction 
this year. We are very united and 
loyal. The bench is loud and enthu
siastic.... The difference between 
this year and last is our energy 
level. They have a lot of fun this 
year.
The Tartans have a week off 
before hosting Washington and 
Jefferson on January 31. After that, 
they close out the year with seven 
straight UAA games. At 10-7 the 
team is on track to finish with a win
ning record for the first time since 
1992-93.

The primary problem for the 
Tartans was scoring, and moreLast year the Carnegie Mellon 
mens basketball team went 
through a rebuilding process, and 
this year it has become evident 
that the process continues. Since 
winter break started the team has

The team has had to make some 
adjustments through the season in 
response to a number of factors.
Information systems masters stu
dent Chris Butsko has still not fully 
recovered from a knee injury, and 
as a result can play only short 
stints.
It is safe to say he is probably

offense, while CMU struggled. At 
times the Yellowjackets lead was 
as much as 17 points. CMU was 
able to close that gap slightly, but 
in the end lost 50-61.
I have no idea why our 
offense is struggling right 
now, because every day in 
practice we work hard and 
run it very well, said Tata. 
I think everyone needs to 
be more patient and keep 
the floor spread. If we can 
do this in the games, then 
we will be okay.
Sundays game against 
Case Western Reserve 
University began more 
auspiciously for the 
Tartans. In the opening 
minutes they sped to a 
12-2 lead on the strength 
of three three-pointers 
from sophomore Dom 
Ionadi and a lay-up from 
Tata followed by a free
the team. The team started the sea
son with a high-pressure defense 
and a deep rotation off of the 
bench, which it still has. The teams 
depth has been cut somewhat 
though, and because of a lack of 
height and the style of play in the 
UAA, the team goes with a three
us to play more up-tempo on 
offense.
Over the weekend the Tartans 
played at home, but were only 
able to walk away with the tenth 
and eleventh losses in a row this 
season.

Peter Wang/Photo Staff !
Despite the Tartans' best efforts, they lost twice last week
end to extend their skid to 11 games.
CMU shot only 20 percent from the 
floor and was 0-9 from three-point 
range. Poor execution from the 
point, rushed shots, and bad luck 
all contributed. The problem of bad 
outside shooting was exacerbated 
by the relative lack of rebounding.
For the most part, we were not 
being very aggressive offensively, 
said Deabrunzzo. We settled for a 
lot of jump shots toward the end of 
the shot clock. When we picked up 
the pace of the game, we got better 
shots.
A source of small hope for the 
second half lay in the fact that 
CMUs defense was much better 
than its offense. Rochester was 
held to 39 percent shooting, 
although they hit four of ten three 
pointers. CMUs press was effective 
in slowing down Rochester, howev
er. Unlike the beginning of the 
year, the Tartans gave up few easy 
baskets or transition points 
because of their 3/4 court press.
Our defense played real well.... I 
think we held them to 38 percent 
shooting, which is real good, said 
first-year H&SS student Marc Tata. 
Our pressure at the end of the 
game was real good, because we 
cut the lead in half, but again our 
offense didnt come through when 
we needed it. Our pressure caused 
them to turn the ball over and that 
is what we need to do to all of our 
opponents.
Unfortunately, the team wasnt 
able to improve their offense 
enough in the second half. 
Rochester was too consistent on
The Tartans momentum 
was abruptly taken away with 15 
minutes left in the half when 
Ionadi and a CWRU player 
crashed out of bounds while chas
ing a loose ball. The CWRU player 
took exception to Ionadis effort, 
and got in his face about it. Firstyear student Randall McKinney 
shoved the Case player in the 
exchange, and received a techni
cal foul.
CMUs offense did not wilt away 
with the loss of the lead. McKinney 
took the ball to the basket and 
earned trips to the free throw line a 
few times, and stingy defense 
sparked fast breaks for the team. 
By the end of the half CMU had 
earned 13 free-throw shots, and

At the end of the half the team 
was down only two points, 32-34. 
The second half was competitive 
for the Tartans, who nearly caught 
Case a few times, in the end, poor 
shooting was the main reason CMU 
lost. The first half s shooting per
centages were all higher than the 
second half s. That, combined with 
turnovers, kept the Tartans at 
arms length from CWRU for the 
rest of the game.
For the last couple of games 
weve played very good defense, 
but have really struggled 
offense, said first-year Ross 
Freeman after the Rochester game. 
Other players and Coach Wingen 
echoed the same statement, and 
were upbeat despite the tough 
times.
There is a level of frustration 
there for all of us, said Wingen.
First dual meet loss of season doesnt slow CMU swimming juggernaut
teaming with Rockwll, Andrew, 
and sophomore English major 
Monica Costlow to win the 200-yard, 
medley relay in 1:56.15.
Andrew added wins in the 100- 
yard freestyle and 50-yard freestyle 
(55.67 and 25.49 seconds, respec
tively), and Rockwell took home 
first in the 200-yard individual med
ley (2:17.42). Costlow added anoth
er strong performance, winning the 
200 yard butterfly in 2:24.63.
For the men, the meet was more 
of the same, as the Tartans won with 
little difficulty. Belowich, Heidinger, 
Striner, and Peters teamed up to win 
the 200 yard medley relay, beating 
out three other CMU teams, as the 
Tartans swept the top four places in 
the event. Belowich also won the 
200 yard backstroke (2:02.31) and 
tied Heidinger for first in the 50 
yard freestyle with a time of 22.51 
seconds.
16-6 edge in event wins.
Even though they lost the meet, 
the Tartans had their usual amount 
of solid individual performances. 
First-year CIT student Billy Gaines 
turned in a blistering time of 
17:04.95 to win the 1650-yard 
freestyle by 16.06 seconds.
The rest of CMUs scoring mostly 
came, as usual, from the group of 
senior psychology major Mike 
Robinson, junior business adminis
tration major Jon Alpert, sophorated by just 1.67 seconds, and the 
200 individual medley saw the top 
five finishers all within 5.74 sec
onds.
The only other win the CMU men 
managed was in the 400-yard med
ley relay as the CMU team cruised to 
a comfortable 4.35 second victory in 
3:36.68. Shewchuk and Belowich 
finished second and third, respec

almost identical times of 22.34 and

After returning from their annual 
winter training trip to Fort 
Lauderdale, Florida, the Carnegie 
Mellon swimming teams probably 
wished they had stayed for a couple 
more weeks. Not only did the teams 
have to abandon the sun and surf 
for the brutal Pittsburgh winter, but 
their first meet was 
against equally tough 
Westminster College 
squads that sent the 
men to their first dual 
meet loss of the year 
and the wo-men to 
their second.
Each of the 22 events 
was tightly contested, 
with CMU and 
Westminster splitting 
points in each race. In 
the end, though,
Westminster piled up 
just enough of an edge, 
as the Tartan men fell 
108-97. On the 
womens side, things 
were much the same, 
though the score was a
little more lopsided as The men's unbeaten season came to an end against Westminster College, but the team
Westminster pulled abounded admirably against Washington and Jefferson a week later.
away to a 123-80 victory.
For the majority of the meet, the 
Tartans depth carried them along, 
as the teams racked up a combined 
14 second-place finishes and eight 
third-place finishes. In the end, 
however, Westminster was just too 
strong, placing multiple swimmers 
in almost every event and claiming a
more architecture major Matthew 
Schewchuk, and sophomore psy
chology major Sean Belowich. 
Robinson won both the 100-yard 
freestyle (48.19 seconds) and 200- 
yard individual medley (2:01.25) 
events, though both races were 
closely contested. The top three 
spots in the 100 freestyle were sepaa second-place finish in the 100 yard 
backstroke (54.84).
Alperts contribution consisted of 
a second-place time of 1:47.16 in the 
200-yard freestyle. The Tartans day 
was rounded out by solid perfor
mances by junior art major George 
Heidinger, who took second in the 
100-yard fly, and sophomore
physics major Ian Peters, who 
placed third in the 100-yard butter
fly and tied for second in the 100- 
yard breaststroke with junior civil 
engineering major Jason Striner.
The women received their usual 
strong performances from senior 
civil engineering major Erin 
Rockwell, junior design major Julie 
Tseng, sophomore business admin
istration major Erin Andrew, and 
first-year design major Mei-Lan HoWalker. Andrew won both the 50 
and 100-yard freestyle events with 
respective times of 25.74 and 56.01 
seconds to lead the squad.
Rockwell added a pair of secondplaces in the 100-yard breaststroke 
(1:09.35) and 200-yard individual 
medley (2:19.50). Tseng also came 
home with two seconds, finishing as 
runner-up in both the 200-yard 
-freestyle (1:57.56) and 500-yard 
freestyle (5:15.67) by a combined 
0.34 seconds. Ho-Walker added a 
third in the 200-yard freestyle for 
the Tartans.
Coming off the most disappoint
ing week of the season to date, the 
teams rebounded sharply when 
they hosted Washington and 
Jefferson (W & J) last Saturday. The 
meet was a return to form for the 
Tartans, who dominated the meet 
from start to finish, winning 19 out 
of the 27 events. The final scores 
were CMU 150, W & J 90 for the 
men, and CMU 134, W & J 92 for the 
women.
Tseng led the way for the women, 
and would not be denied a firstplace finish this time, winning the 
1000-yard freestyle (11:01.04), 
200-yard backstroke (2:17.08), and

Exercise is overrated
LESS STRESS?
by Emily Landes
There are many people who enjoy exercise. 
They live to push their bodies a little bit further 
each day. For these people, each abdominal 
crunch, brings them closer to personal satisfac
tion, and 3 sculpted figure is only one of the 
many rewards of daily exercise.
Unfortunately, I am not one of these people. I 
detest exercise, every single minute of it. If I 
could live my whole life without ever taking one 
unnecessary step I would be a happy person.
But sadly, I have the same metabolism level as 
a sea manatee, so at the beginning of every 
semester I trot out the spandex workout shorts 
and hope for the best. If the long wait for the 
Stairmaster is any indication, then I am not 
alone. For many students, the start of the semes
ter, when we still have the illusion of free time, 
is the perfect time to flock to the gym in droves 
in an attempt to work their way back to their 
pre-college figures. (At the University of 
Michigan some enterprising students sold 
Orientation T-shirts which read, Freshman 
Girls: Get them while theyre skinny! While as a 
woman I find this statement degrading and 
misogynistic, as a girl who stares wistfully at her 
senior prom pictures, periodically exclaiming I 
used to be so hot!, I cant help but admit that its 
underlying premise is sound.)

of each semester is a time when many students 
start new weight loss routines. So, last week our

In what was perhaps the most 
heavily attended performance of 
the season, the Pittsburgh
Symphony Orchestra brought the 
20th century to a close with a 
tremendous program of works by 
Mendelssohn, Stravinsky, and
Rossini. The highlight of the con
cert was the performance of 
Mendelssohns Violin Concerto in E 
minor, featuring Sarah Chang as 
soloist.
The concerto, with its brilliant 
arpeggios and dynamic passages 
was brilliantly executed by Chang. 
Changs performace was especially 
riveting during her cadenza in the 
first movement. Held spellbound by 
the violinist, the audience hung on 
every note, as the orchestra took 
them audience on a thrilling ride.
Chang, at 18 years old, has 
enjoyed an extremely successful 
career as a classical violinist. Her 
performance career began very 
early, at age 5, and her orchestral 
engagements have included appear
ances with the New York 
Philharmonic, the Philadelphia 
Orchestra, and the London
Symphony, as well as recitals 
throughout Europe and the United 
States.
She has recorded four highly 
acclaimed titles with EMI Classics, 
including her first album of of violin 
and piano pieces, Debut, which 
almost instantly became a classical 
bestseller. Chang maintains a 
diverse recital and concerto reper
toire, with a focus on on Romantic 
and contemporary works by such 
composers as Tchaikovsky, 
Vieuxtemps, Paganini, and Vaughan 
Williams.
Additionally, the PSO performed 
Igor Stravinskys Petrouchka, which 
was the second in a brilliant trilogy 
of ballets composed by Stravinsky 
for Sergei Diaghilevs Ballet Russes. 
The piece focuses on Petrouchka, a 
puppet who comes to life at a fair 
and falls in love with a ballerina. 
The ballet chronicles Petrouchkas 
downfall beautifully, and the PSO 
brought this tragic tale to life elo
quently.
Both the Mendelssohn and 
Stravinsky pieces were preceded by 
a light-hearted Rossini piece, an 
overture to La Scala di Seta. In the 
PSOs next concert, guest conductor 
and violinist Pinchas Zukerman will 
perform Bachs Concerto in D 
minor for Two Violins with the PSO 
concertmaster Andres Cardenes.

!
(U-WIRE) DETROIT  Over 30 
I manufacturers from around the 
world representing countries from 
Korea to Sweden are displaying 
their finest products under the 
j bright lights of the Cobo Center dur'ing the annual North American 
,i International Auto Show (NAIAS). 
i To put the evolution of the autoi mobile in the twentieth century into 
i perspective, the first Detroit Auto 
j Show in 1907 had 17 exhibitors who 
I displayed a grand total of 33 vehi
cles. This year, there are 67 
I exhibitors and over 700 vehicles on 
! display. Since becoming an internaj tional even in 1989, the NAIAS has 
I hosted 561 North American and 
' worldwide vehicle introductions. 
1 This year, there are 62 vehicles mak! ing their debuts at the show, 37 of 
! them concept cars (cars without a 
; defined agenda for release).
Putting together the NAIAS is a 
formidable task. Fourteen semi;! trailers are required to carry the 
;! 75,000-plus yards of carpet used for 
the exhibits and aisles at the NAIAS. 
| If the carpet was made into a two 
foot-wide runner, it would be 66 
! miles long. With the average home 
using 125 yards, the carpet used at
the NAIAS would cover the equiva
lent of 600 homes.
Equipment needed to setup the 
show includes over 1,000 semi
trucks, 14 million pounds of freight, 
75 forklifts, 18 45-foot booms, 20 
scissor lifts, and 12 miles of electric 
wires. In the three weeks it takes to 
prepare the NAIAS for the media 
and public, 600 carpenters, 300 
teamsters and riggers, and 150 elec
tricians will work on the show 
setup.
It takes many other personnel to 
prepare the auto show including; 75 
stagehands, 200 janitorial workers, 
87 full-time Cobo Center staff mem
bers and 20 additional part-time 
Cobo Center staff members. 135 
lucky car porters then have the task 
of moving in the individual vehicles 
and placing them on their respec
tive stands. Once situated, 65 pol
ishers come through and rub the 
cars to a spotless perfection. 
Between 500 and 700 catering per
sonnel are also needed to provide 
food for the exhibition attendants.
The total value of the exhibitions 
within the Cobo Center is immea
surable. Some experts claim the fig
ure is easily in the tens of billions of 
dollars because of the hefty price 
tags associated with many of the 
cars. Concept cars alone represent 
millions, if not billions of dollars in
research and development costs. 
They then have an added value for 
their uniqueness, as they are the 
only prototype in existence. There 
are over 650 production models on 
the floor as well, not. one of them 
being inexpensive. There are very 
few cars pricing under $20,000. 
Most of the sports cars 
(Lamborghinis, Bugattis and 
Ferraris especially) are well over the 
$100,000 mark. The exhibits this 
year are bigger and more extrava
gant than ever. Car companies are 
sparing no expense in making their 
exhibitions alluring and unique. 
The total cost of the exhibit materi
als alone (sans cars) nears $200 mil
lion.
Historically, the NAIAS has been a 
vital stop in the Auto Show circuit. 
The Detroit show is one of the 
longest running auto shows in the 
country, running every year (with 
the exception of four war years) 
since 1907. When, in 1989, the 
Detroit show went international, 
Detroit was the first city able to give 
worldwide recognition to two 
brands that have since redefined the 
luxury car market: Lexus and 
Infiniti. Ever since becoming an 
international show, the NAIAS has 
become a bigger draw to the press 
and ordinary sightseers alike.
There are over 6,300 members of
the media covering the auto show, 
representing 61 countries and 39 
states. Over 200 television networks 
will be broadcasting from the auto 
show, at least 50 being from inter
national networks. One NAIAS offi
cial described walking around dur
ing press week, listening to 
German, Japanese and French 
being spoken and then occasionally 
hearing English. Public attendance 
for the show is expected to exceed
750.000 people.
Although last years attendance 
was far lower than expected, offi
cials don't think that will be a prob
lem this year. Public attendance for 
the show is expected to exceed
750.000 people. The lack of major 
snowfall encourages more people to 
visit the exhibitions.
The NAIAS also has tremendous 
benefits for the Southeast Michigan 
area.
A lot of revenue is expected to 
flow into the city of Detroit for 
events outside the Auto Show. There 
are many hotel reservations booked 
and with the expected masses of 
sightseers, parking spaces will be in 
high demand. Bank's vice-president 
David Littmann estimates the eco
nomic impact of this year's show 
alone will bring in nearly half a bil
lion dollars of revenue to local busi
nesses.

tion of Grease would not notice the 
subtle differences. An excellent 
singer, Erika Shannon, who plays 
the innocent Sandy Dumbrowski,  
sings out it in Since I Don't Have 
You. Charlie Brady, the sympathet
ic guy at Rydell High School, sings 
Alone at a Drive-In-Movie with 
much emotion. Shannon and Brady 
work very well together as a couple. 
Noteworthy is Joy Pearson who 
brings the character of Betty Rizzo, 
a corrupt .girl, to life. The only 
drawback in the music was the 
orchestra. It seemed a bit tacky and 
out of place. Often, the dialogue
and lyrics could not be heard 
because of the uncontrollable 
music.
The set, a design of James 
Fouchard, was acceptable. It could 
have been designed more carefully. 
From the audience you could see 
people running behind the sets on 
stage. Other than that, it accurately 
portrayed the backdrop of Rydell 
High.
Gargaro Productions shows 
promise for future performances. 
Grease is the first of their series this 
season. Look forward to future pro
ductions at the Byham Theater. 
Grease will be playing until the 30th.

P January 10,1950  On a one-semester trial 
; basis, the executive board of Carnegie Tech 
. planned for seniors in all engineering and sci\ ence departments and in printing and industrial management to have no Saturday class! es. This change would cut down the normal
 six-day work week but would not change the
 workload for seniors in those programs. The 
I board tentatively planned to extend the five1 day work week to juniors as well, pending a 
i successful outcome with the senior class.
25 YEARS AGO
 January 14, 1975  Construction started 
1 on a $38,000 improvement of CMU computer 
; facilities. Plans for the addition were formed 
I the previous spring when the Computer
 Science department realized they did not 
have enough space for the number of con tracts they had.

The area which was used for keypunching 
was converted into a machine room. The new 
plan also called for teletypes and a remote job 
entry facility with a self-service card reader 
and printer to be added to the Computer 
Science facilities on the fifth floor of Science 
Hall. It was hoped that the improvements 
would eliminate or at least lessen crowding 
and long waits at the computing facilities.
10 YEARS AGO
January 23, 1990  After the Beaux Arts 
Ball was canceled in 1989, the new Beaux Arts 
Ball committee planned, an even bigger and 
more eccentric ball for 1990. The theme, 
Risorgimento, meaning reawakening in 
Italian, will have nothing to do with the deco
rations throughout the College of Fine Arts 
building. The theme, however, served as 
guide for ballgoers to base their costumes on.
Entertainers such as various bands, circus
performers, tap dancers, and one individual 
who set himself on fire roamed the halls and 
performed on a makeshift stage with real scaf
folding. Prizes for eccentric costumes were 
also planned to be given out at the door.
FIVE YEARS AGO
January 23,1995  Carnegie Mellons fail
ure to observe Martin Luther King, Jr. Day and 
decision to start second semester classes on 
that day triggered anger and also apathy 
throughout the campus. In past years, the 
Carnegie Mellon Action Program (CMAP) had 
sponsored events in observance of Dr. Kings 
birthday. For the first time since 1987, there 
were no activities planned by this group. In 
fact, the only program held was a community 
service project at the Shepherd Wellness 
Community on following Saturday.
Several professors decided to cancel 
Monday classes or held abbreviated classes
because they felt the holiday was important 
for students to recognize.
ONE YEAR AGO
January 18, 1999  Returning dorm resi
dents came back to school to find problems 
ranging from water damage to limited heat 
and shortages of hot water. Many of the prob
lems were due to frozen pipes in both 
Morewood Gardens and West Wing. However, 
problems with a heating valve on the Hill 
resulted in a lack of heat for residents of the 
Hill.
Many students suffered damage to personal 
property because of flooding in dorm rooms 
and were asked to contact their insurance car
riers to replace the damage.

Exercising can be fun, but only without stairmasters Opening attracts crowd
WEIGHT, from page LI 
usually tight-fisted university uncurled its pinky 
just enough to offer up a free week of group exer
cise. Now I know that everyone is very busy, so I 
tried out a few of these classes for you.
You all owe me one.
To understand the extent of the sacrifice that I 
have made for you, please realize that the only 
thing that I hate more than exercise is group exer
cise.
This is why I usually exercise in one of the two 
University Center workout rooms, though my 
preference definitely lies with the larger workout 
room next to the water fountains, mainly because 
its next to the water fountains. It also has that 
slightly competitive air of many workout rooms, 
where you feel as though everyone is checking 
you out when, in actuality, they are probably 
more interested in seeing if anyone is checking 
them out.
But I left my cozy world of personal fitness last 
week when I entered a yoga class taught by the 
remarkably lithe Saeeda. If the motto in the 
workout room is Push yourself to the limit, the 
motto for Saeedas yoga class was Push yourself? 
Why would you want to do a silly thing like that? 
With advice like, Listen to your bodys natural 
rhythms and mock admonishments like Dont 
laugh, itll only strengthen your immune system 
Saeedas lulling and encouraging approach really 
helped her class of beginning yoga students feel 
minimally stupid as we saluted the sun and
held the warrior pose.
Clearly this approach is something that people 
are responding to, as the class was filled to capac
ity both times that I attended it. Before each class 
Saeeda tells her students that yoga is a non-competitive sport and that we shouldnt compare our
selves with our neighbors. For me, this was the 
hardest part of the class. Dont compare yourself 
to your neighbors? Why, thats just plain unAmerican!
Other than that, I found the class very benefi
cial and easy to pick up, though not as easy as 
some may imagine. There is this perception that 
yoga is not a real workout, but just an hour of 
easy stretches to New Age music. Unfortunately, 
the New Age music portion of that statement is 
correct. However, anyone who has ever taken a 
yoga class can tell you that the stretches are any
thing but easy. For the uninitiated, try thinking of 
how your body felt during your most intense 
game of Twister. Then multiply that by 10 and 
perhaps you can understand the Oooh, Ooooh, 
Oooooh, (Okay, now release.), Ahhhhhhh that is 
the essence of yoga.
In fact, I was so happy with the class that I 
decided to check out other types of eastern-influenced exercise by attending Tang Soo Do with 
Mr. Stawski. However, when I arrived and saw 
that I was the only one without a white robe and 
brightly colored belt, I hightailed it out of there.
Checking my bright yellow Group Exercise 
Schedule, I saw that I could still make a step
class, taught by the ubiquitous TBA. TBA in this 
case was a peppy blond whose real name, sadly, I 
didnt quite catch because I was to busy trying not 
to hate her'Every time she chirped, Now PonyStep! Four more!
The step class certainly was a different kind of 
workout from the yoga class. For one thing there 
was no Ahhhh. There was only Ooh, Eeep, Ouch, 
and especially Doh! Also, unlike yoga, you are 
expected to look at your neighbors. How else 
would you know that youre doing every single 
step incorrectly? Then again, I did feel a sense of 
achievement after I finished the step class that I 
did not at the end of the yoga class. I was proud 
of the perspiration running down my back and 
my flushed face and all the other physical evi
dence of my struggles.
A sense of achievement from exercise? Uh-Oh! 
Maybe Im turning into one of those people who 
enjoy exercise after all. Maybe someday I too will 
see exercise as not just a means to an end, but as 
a beautiful expression of the human condition 
and the heights that we can reach when we try 
our best.
Oh, who am I kidding? I came home that day 
and ate 218 Christmas M&Ms. Oh well, see you 
all in the gym next semester!

Lunar eclipse dazzles the night sky
by Thaddeus Billman
Staffwriter
The blood-red moon pierced the 
Starry sky. All around America 
people craned their necks to see 
the phenomenal sight, but alas, 
students at Carnegie Mellon were 
not able to witness the rare event.
On Thursday night, the moon 
passed through the Earths shad
ow, causing the first total lunar 
eclipse viewable in North America 
since September 1996. The moon 
Was expected to assume a range of 
colors from bright red to orange to 
yellow. Unfortunately, cloud cover 
obscured much of the nations 
view. Here at Carnegie Mellon, the 
start of the eclipse was viewable, 
but clouds moved in quickly, well 
before totality, or when the Earths 
shadow completely covers the 
moon, occurred.
The eclipse began at approxi
mately 10 pm EST and lasted until 
l:25 am. The moon was complete
ly inside the Earths shadow from 
just after 11 pm until 12:22 am, 
resulting in a 78-minute total 
eclipse.
In any given year, there can be 
anywhere from zero to three 
eclipses. This year sees two, the 
second being the longest eclipse 
since the 1850s, with total immer
sion lasting an hour and 48 min
utes. It will, unfortunately, not be 
visible in the United States; we will 
have to wait until May 2003 for 
another chance to view one here. 
We will, however, be graced by a 
partial solar eclipse on Christmas 
this year.
A lunar eclipse occurs when the 
Earth casts its shadow on the full 
moon, blocking the sunlight that 
otherwise reflects off the moons 
surface. The majority of the time, 
the moon passes either below or

not all opportunity to see the phe
nomenon was lost due to cloudy 
skies. A number of Web sites offered 
live webcam views of the moon. 
This gave people who did not live in 
the western hemisphere a chance to 
watch the eclipse. Demand was 
high, causing some sites to crash or 
at least load very slowly.
However, many popular sites had 
the bandwidth to handle the thou
sands of curious Web users who 
wanted to watch the eclipse in real 
time. While not as good as first
hand observation, these cameras 
provided a way to experience the 
eclipse.
Technology allows instant translations
by Seth Mandel
Managing Editor
In todays global economy, lan
guage barriers are perhaps some of 
the greatest obstacles businesses 
face. Professional human transla
tors have traditionally translated 
between languages at considerable 
costs in terms of both time and 
money. But new technology being 
developed at Carnegie Mellon aims 
to put an end to these challenges 
with a spontaneous speech-tospeech translation system.
Carnegie Mellon researchers, as 
part of the international 
Consortium for Speech Translation 
Advanced Research (C-STAR), 
have been working on the automat
ic translation of spoken language 
since 1991 and currently are able to 
translate between languages spon
taneously.
C-STAR recently conducted an 
international videoconference that 
translated between six different
languages at locations around the 
world. This system represented 
significant advances in terms of 
speech recognition, machine trans
lation, and speech translation sys
tems. A large vocabulary, consisitng of over 10,000 words, also 
made this latest endeavor more sig
nificant than past efforts. Whereas 
speakers were confined to using 
specific words and perfect syntax 
in previous trials, they were not 
restricted in this way during this 
latest demonstration.
During the videoconference, par
ticipants, who were located in the 
United States, Japan, Korea, 
Germany, Italy, and France, were 
able to speak freely to each other in 
their native languages. The system 
instantly translated their speech to 
the appropriate languages for the 
other participants to hear. The 
researchers, acting as mock travel 
agents, used a Web interface to 
simulate making travel plans to 
each others countries.
Participants were able to view pho
tos, train schedules, and hotel 
rooms. This activity represented a 
practical business application 
where such technology would be 
valuable.
The demonstration also involved 
using wearable computers to assist 
in the translation effort. The mobil
ity of such technology has torn 
down many of the barriers that 
have existed in terms of the practi
cal use of speech-to-speech transla
tion technology.
While speech recognition and 
machine translation systems have 
existed for some time, the task of 
spontaneous speech-to-speech 
translation is considerably more 
complex than simply combining 
these two systems.
After all, human speech rarely 
adheres strictly to formal syntax 
rules. Instead, people hesitate in 
their speech, make and correct mis
takes, and do not speak in logical 
sentences.
These common occurrences gen
erally do not cause problems in 
terms of comprehension for people 
because we use context clues to 
infer meaning. C-STARs system 
successfully translates between 
languages by trying to extract the 
general intent of what is said. After 
determining the general semantic 
meaning of the spoken words, the 
system translates that speech into 
one of the six languages with 
which it is familiar. The advantage 
of this technology is that it can eas
ily be extended to many languages 
by using this approach.
The system also uses an examplebased technique to automatically 
infer corresponding phrases. This 
feature is extremely useful because 
it allows for extension by adding 
additional automatic example 
data. This latest research also rep
resents advances in speech recog
nition to filter hesitations and 
interuptions, such as um and 
er.
Free DVD movies?
GEEKby Kevin
If a criminal robs a companys 
safe by drilling out the lock, can 
the company hold the drill manu
facturer responsible, at least in 
part? Of course not. Its not the 
manufacturers fault that the tool 
was used for an illicit purpose. Yet 
a program to allow Linux users to 
decode and play DVD movies, 
known as DeCSS, seems to have 
ruffled the feathers of the motion 
picture industry. In particular, the 
DVD Copy Control Association 
(DVD CCA), the organization that 
developed the DVD encryption 
algorithm and licenses it to manu
facturers of DVDs and DVD play
ers, has sued 21 named defen
dants and at least 72 Does  
people operating Web sites whose 
names are not immediately clear 
to DVD CCA but are either distrib
uting either DeCSS or a link to it
 for an injunction to stop dis
tributing their trade secret.
The problem is that the DVD 
CCAs case is based upon what 
they perceive as a threat of DVD 
piracy. But the people they should 
really be after are those who actu
ally use this tool to make illegal 
copies of DVD movies.
Of course, those people arent 
terribly smart to begin with. Lets 
consider the different ways a 
bootlegger can make a copy of a 
DVD movie, even without the aid 
of DeCSS. Bit-for-bit disk copiers, 
similar to those used to duplicate 
important floppy disks for 
archival purposes, can replicate 
an entire DVD  encrypted or not
 such that DVD players cannot 
distinguish the copy from the 
original. But recordable DVD 
media is expensive  about $50 a 
disc. Tools have also been devel
oped that hook into a PCs video 
system, capturing the decrypted 
movie as it is played on the users 
PC. Unfortunately, the captured 
data weighs in at around nine 
gigabytes for a typical full-length 
movie. As of this writing, the 
cheapest nine-gigabyte EIDE hard 
drive listed on pricewatch.com 
retails for $117  hardly worth it 
when you can buy an original, 
legitimate copy of the movie for 
$20.
If all else fails, a bootlegger can 
simply set up a video camera, aim 
it at his monitor, play the DVD, 
and record it on conventional 
videotape. The quality wont be as 
good, but itll be good enough to 
sell to somebody looking to save a 
few bucks. This route is probably 
the most realistic for a potential 
pirate, but they still dont need 
DeCSS to do it. The truth is, the 
encryption scheme, known as the 
Content Scrambling System (CSS, 
from which DeCSS derives its 
name), is hardly a deterrent to 
someone looking to make illegal. 
copies of a movie. Thus, its hard
ly reasonable to conclude that a 
program such as DeCSS was 
developed for this purpose.
So if DeCSS wasnt developed 
with the intention to pirate DVDs, 
then why was it developed? Dont 
think too hard. The only other
Magnetic floating frogs
Youve heard of animal mag
netism, right? Well, a group of 
European scientists have levitat
ed a frog six feet off the ground 
by using a large magnet.
British and Dutch 
researchers devised the float
ing frog by producing an enor
mous magnetic field.
All objects, including frogs 
and humans, have minor mag
netic properties. And, accord
ing to the scientists, if you sup
ply enough magnetic force to 
overcome the force of gravity, 
you can cause any object, in 
this case a frog, to float.
This team of researchers has 
also put plants, grasshoppers, 
and fish in the air with the 
greatest of ease and they say 
it's only a matter of time 
before a human being is levi
tated. Theyll have to use a 
really big magnet for that!
The scientists insist the frog felt 
no ill effects. They claim the experi
ence is much like the weightless

frog was unavailable for comment.

Center receives grant from IBM
by Sriram Gollapalli
Science & Technology Editor
The Center for Automated Learning and Discovery 
(CALD) at Carnegie Mellon received a $560,000 gift 
from IBM Corporation. This center focuses on data 
mining research and received this gift in the form of 
various pieces of equipment.
The gift consists of computer servers, data manage
ment software, a one-terabyte redundant arrays of 
independent disks (RAID) storage disk, and an 
expandable tape-cartridge robot with hundreds of 
tape cartridges.
The CALD started because machine learning, data 
mining, statistics, and discovery are becoming more 
and more important in todays data-centric world. 
The commercial interest increases with the availabili
ty of more data. Networking technologies are 
expanding access to many people around the world.
The mission of the CALD is to pursue basic science 
in automated learning methods, including data min
ing and knowledge discovery, driven by applications 
to problems of societal importance.
The center works on a variety of research projects. 
Some include Learning in Robotics, Mining the World 
Wide Web, Searching by Content and Data Mining in 
Multimedia Databases, and Data Mining for 
Manufacturing. People from a variety of colleges and
departments provide help for these projects.
Data mining consists of using research methods to 
retrieve data in a consist and fast method. One project 
examines fast methods for approximate matching in 
multimedia databases. A typical query is as follows: 
in a collection of product photographs, find products 
that look like tennis shoes.
Some practical applications of this research include 
electronic commerce, where they can help users to 
search large online databases with product pho
tographs, in addition to other factors, such as price, 
maker, availability, etc.
Another area in which data mining will be used 
more often is edu-tainment. This area consists of 
large databases of video clips, art images, NASA pho
tographs, and meteorological/geological maps. 
Potential users include students, researchers, cus
tomers of a video on-demand service, etc.
CALD draws together faculty from a variety of 
departments at CMU, such as Computer Science, 
Statistics, Psychology, Philosophy, Robotics, and the 
Graduate School of Industrial Administration.
The Center was founded in 1997 with grants from 
Carnegie Mellon and corporations. In addition to 
IBM, CALD has many corporate sponsors, including 
Caterpillar, Microsoft, and Oracle. The center also 
offers a masters degree in knowledge discovery and 
data mining.

real use it might have is to  you 
guessed it  play DVDs. And 
since bootlegging DVDs is hardly 
economical, chances are good 
that the people using DeCSS legit
imately own the DVDs they want 
to play. Now if someone does fig
ure out a cheap way to copy DVDs, 
and they use DeCSS to do so, then 
by all means someone  most 
likely, the MPAA  should go 
after them. Like the burglar in my 
opening example, theyre using a 
legitimate tool for illegitimate 
purposes.
Of course, theres a much deep
er issue involved in this case. 
According to OpenDVD.org  one 
proponent of distributing DeCSS
 the DVD CCA has refused 
licenses to the DVD encryption 
information to Linux developers 
because they arent interested in 
the Linux market, or because they 
think the Linux market isnt inter
ested in using DVDs. Personally, I 
dont buy that idea. The funda
mental issue here is that the DVD 
CCA wants to keep tabs on who 
has access to that information, in 
order to protect their encryption 
scheme. But the Linux communi
tys open source development 
policy  by which the source 
code for Linux itself, and that for 
a large body of software devel
oped for Linux, is freely available
 represents a serious threat to 
the DVD CCAs control.
The Linux community respond
ed by attempting to reverse-engineer the encryption algorithm  
and eventually succeeded. The 
DVD CCA asserts in its suit that 
such a reverse engineering is ille
gal, as the encryption algorithm is 
a trade secret. However, reverse 
engineering is in fact a widely 
used tool not only in software but 
in any engineering- or development-oriented industry. How can 
you build a better mousetrap if 
you dont understand how the old 
one works?
Now if there existed a patent on 
CSS, then they would have a case
 but, at the same time, U.S. 
patent law would require them to 
disclose full details of the encryp
tion scheme in exchange for 
exclusive rights to it. The develop
er who finally cracked the scheme 
did not steal any information 
from the movie industry to do so; 
he did it with his own intellect, 
and he should be entitled to some 
credit for that.
The motion picture industry is 
barking up the wrong tree. DeCSS 
wont hurt movie companies at 
all; in fact, it will help them by 
allowing them to tap a new mar
ket  Linux users. They need to 
let this case go and get their 
lawyers after the real criminals  
those who are actually making 
illegal copies of movies and sell
ing them for profit.

Hacker arrested for computer crimes jnlC1,C 3jhn14 lCUSsgrs
in science research funds
HACKER, from page L4 
Nokia, and Sun Microsystems.
He became an icon to some 
hackers after leading the FBI on a 
three-year manhunt that ended in 
1995 when investigators traced his 
electronic footprints to a Raleigh, 
N.C., apartment.
After driving away with family 
members from the Federal 
Correctional Institute in Lompoc 
on Friday, Mitnick paused to read a 
prepared statement accusing pros
ecutors and the news media of 
grossly exaggerating his crimes 
and hindering his defense.
My crimes were simple crimes of 
trespass, he said. My case is a case 
of curiosity. I wanted to know as 
much as I could find out about how
phone networks worked, and the ins 
and outs of computer security. 
Attorney Don Randolph said 
Mitnick will try to persuade the 
court to allow him to attend col
lege  to study computers and 
technology.
As Mitnick settles in Los Angeles, 
his publicist, Jack Biello, said his 
clients task will be to get his feet 
wet in modern day society and try 
to figure out how to make a living. 
In his statement, Mitnick railed 
at prosecutors and criticized as 
inaccurate two books  
Cyberpunk, which chronicled the 
early hacking days of himself and 
others, and Takedown, which 
focused on the manhunt for him 
throughout the years.
New York Times reporter John 
Markoff, who co-authored the 
books, said Mitnick was not inter
viewed for them because ' he 
demanded payment.
The former hackers criticisms 
suggest that he still doesnt get it, 
Markoff said. The simple fact is it 
is a felony to break into computers. 
It is a felony to commit telephone 
fraud.
In an interview with CBSs 60 
Minutes scheduled to air Sunday, 
January 23, Mitnick says he com
mitted his crimes for fun, never 
profit.
I was an accomplished trespass
er, he said. I dont consider 
myself a thief. I copied without 
permission.
Science briefs
Robot nurse 
helps elderly
When you grow older, will you be 
able to live by yourself? With a little 
help from a Carnegie Mellon 
research team, you will.
Nurse Flo, a nursebot, is a product 
of an interdisciplinary design and 
research team consisting of students 
and faculty from Computer Science, 
Psychology, Robotics, and more.
This nursebot will help explore 
the way that elderly people can live 
their lives more independently.
The research team, headed by 
Sebastian Thrun, assistant professor 
of computer science, plans to fulfill 
the following tasks:
 Intelligent reminding, where 
elderly patients will be reminded 
when to go to the restroom or take 
medication.
 Mobile manipulation to help the 
elderly open jar lids or refrigerator 
doors.
 Data collection and surveillance 
should help to monitor health con
ditions of the patients.
Nurse Flo will also be tested to
substitute for 
social interac
tion with
patients. The 
elderly find it 
difficult to inter
act with many 
people. New 
technologies 
should allow 
this robot to 
carry on a con
versation or play 
games with a 
sick patient.
The nursebot 
and its team 
were featured 
on the Today 
Show on NBC 
with Katie 
Couric on 
December 31.
There, they 
explored the 
possibilities of 
robot newscast
ers and other daily occupations.
Soon, these robots will be able to 
provide more functions such as 
opening up jars for arthritis 
patients.

PASADENA, Calif. (AP)  
President Clinton said Friday he 
wants to add nearly $3 billion to 
federal science and technology 
research, a broad effort that he 
said has already fostered amazing 
changes in American life and 
national wealth.
The proposed increase in next 
years budget would add nearly $1 
billion to information technologyrelated computer research.
Although he struggles with com
puter technology himself, Clinton 
speaks with enthusiasm about the 
wonders technology has wrought.
It is changing everything about 
the way we work and live and 
relate to each other, Clinton said 
of the Internet, saying the comput
er network is a major reason for the 
nations continued economic 
growth, which is on pace to break 
all previous records next month.
His own administration also 
should get credit for managing a 
changing economy well, Clinton 
told students and faculty at the 
California Institute of Technology. 
But he acknowledged that, to a 
degree, what the government did 
best was stay out of the way.
The real reason this thing keeps 
going on and on and on is all we 
did in the government was to set 
the conditions and provide the 
tools for the American people to 
succeed, Clinton said in his 
address.
The real reason is the exponen
tial growth in information technol
ogy and how it is rifling through 
every other sector of our economy, 
creating jobs no one had heard of a 
few years ago and reinforcing 
other scientific advances, he said.
The president also cautioned of 
the dark side of scientific and tech
nological advances.
The same genetic revolution 
that can offer new hope for mil
lions of Americans could also be 
used to deny people health insur
ance, clone a human being, he 
said.
Scientists and public servants 
must make sure that science serves 
humanity and not the other way 
around, Clinton said.
Just because we can do some
thing doesnt mean we should, he 
said.
Clinton came to Southern 
California, a major recipient of fed
eral research dollars, to detail his 
plan to add $2.8 billion to the fed
eral budget for science and tech
nology research  benefiting stud
ies of cancer, diabetes, and AIDS as 
well, as computer technology, 
among others. California, with 
about 12 percent of the nations 
population, draws 20 percent of 
federal research dollars.
The president later played golf 
with actor Jack Nicholson and then 
made two rounds of Democratic 
fund raising among Hollywood 
supporters. Clinton was staying at 
the home of film producer David 
Geffen.
Administration officials said 
Friday that Clinton, pursuing his 
goal of connecting all Americans to 
the Internet, will propose federal 
subsidies to narrow the digital 
divide and help millions of lowincome families go online. He has 
said Internet access and usage 
should be as commonplace as the 
telephone.
A draft proposal calls for spend
ing as much as $100 million to pro
vide computers and Internet access 
in perhaps as many as 9 million 
households. Clinton has not yet 
determined the exact size of the 
proposal, said administration offi
cials who spoke on condition of 
anonymity.
The president is expected to 
announce the proposal in his State
of the Union address Thursday.
That speech is also likely to men
tion some details of the package he ' 
announced Friday, including:
1. The National Institutes of 
Health would get an extra $1 bil
lion on top of an existing budget ofnearly $18 billion.
2. The 56-year-old National j 
Science Foundation would get a 171 
percent increase  its largest bud
get boost ever. The $675 million 
would augment an existing budget 
of $3.9 billion.
If approved by Congress, the new . 
money would increase total U.S;? 
spending on basic scientific and.' 
technological research to about/. 
$43 billion in 2001, the White 
House said.
University research spending is, 
popular in Congress, in part,, 
because it spreads dollars outside , 
of Washington. But Republicans.; 
are already warning that ambitious 
new spending packages face rough 
sledding this year.
The GOP-controlled House? 
Budget Committee estimated that, 
before the latest science and tech- ! 
nology proposals, the White Houses 
had called attention to about 50,-, 
new initiatives costing nearly $29.^, 
billion that it plans to include in 
the upcoming budget.
The Clinton university research 
plan reflects an emphasis on bio
medical and so-called lifestyle 
research as opposed to more tradi-. 
tional basic research into mathe
matics and physical sciences. ,,
University-based research pro-:,; 
vides the kind of fundamental, 
insights that are most important in 
any new technology or treatment, 
Clinton said. It helps to produce., 
the next generation of scientists, 
engineers, entrepreneurs, and weintend to give university-based., 
research a major lift.

American Beauty breaks trend, piles up awards
by Anne Ray
Contributing Editor
The trend in these pretentious  but 
somehow relevant  entertainment 
industry award shows is to laud one dra
matic film heavily. And such is the case 
in this year's Golden Globe Awards. 
Here's the pattern: Give this film every 
award it can handle. Wait until the 
Oscars. Then watch the recipients walk 
on stage again, jaded. Even they knew it
 1999 New Line Cinema
Tom Cruise took home the Golden Globe 
award for Best Supporting Actor in a 
motion picture for his role in Magnolia.
was coming. But here's the break - this 
year's baby, American Beauty, is differ
ent. Really different.
Last night, the Hollywood Foreign 
Press Association gave American Beauty 
all the important trophies: Alan Ball for 
best screenplay, Sam Mendes for best 
director, the ubiquitous best dramatic 
film, and a score of other nominations, 
including Annette Benning for best 
actress and Kevin Spacey for best actor. 
All this brou-ha-ha made the Beauty 
crew the smuggest table in the room, 
as Hugh Grant put it during last night's 
ceremony.
Many of the films in the past five years 
to garner multiple awards, including 
best dramatic film, have earned top hon
ors at the Oscars  1997s The English 
Patient, 1998s Titanic, and last year's 
Saving Private Ryan. But Beauty marks a 
significant shift in the films recognized 
by mainstream Hollywood  a shift we 
could really use.
First, Beauty is not a period piece, not 
another hyper-Hollywood-ized epic  
it's a tale that makes suburbanites shud
der in its realness, its present-ness. In 
addition, there arent any of the oftenbeautiful trappings that accompany 
period pieces. No elaborate costumes or 
highly researched battle scenes here, 
just a taut and subtle story. This non
modern trend goes back almost a 
decade: Sense and Sensibility, Forrest 
Gump, Schindlers List, Bugsy, and Dances
With Wolves all won best dramatic film at 
the Golden Globes. Maybe Hugh Grant 
would call this show the most predictable 
table in the room.
Second, this film uses young actors as 
its main players. Were not talking little 
kids, like 11-year-old Haley Joel Osment, 
nominated this year for The Sixth Sense. 
This film is about teenagers and the 
worlds they inhabit, and the ways they 
cross bounds into adult territory. The 
barely pubescent Thora Birch and doe
eyed Wes Bentley are critical characters 
 their characters stories are critical in
this film.
Beautys wins were not the only 
points scored for the AntiPredictability Team. Other films that 
deserve a good watch were recognized. 
Unknown Hilary Swank won best 
actress in Boys Don't Cry, which many 
may remember from a free screening in 
McConomy last fall.
Score one for the New and Different 
Team. If we have any more heartwrenching histories or sunset-tinted 
1950s piers, we may have to go play for 
the other side. Aaack.
Solid performances overcome mediocre writing
MOVIE REVIEW
by Thaddeus Billman
Staff Writer
The year is 1936, and all is not 
well. Mussolini has invaded 
Ethiopia. Hitler is quickly gaining 
power in Germany. Lenin has 
started the Communist revolution 
in Russia. Meanwhile, the United 
States is submerged deep in 
depression. Clashes between 
workers and factory owners are 
growing ever more violent; and in 
general, everything is not right. 
This is the setting for writer/direc
tor Tim Robbins new movie, The 
Cradle Will Rock.
Based on a true story, the movie 
delicately intertwines the lives of 
real and fictional characters, as 
the viewer meets such famous 
names as Nelson Rockefeller, 
William Hearst, and Orson 
Welles. It provides a fascinating 
view into their personal and pro
fessional lives, attempting to 
explain their motives in a way not 
ordinarily possible.
The Cradle Will Rock is a story 
about communism, politics, and 
theater in the 1930s. The main 
plot is centered around 
Congresss attempt to end federally-funded theater. (During the 
Great Depression, the federal gov
ernment sponsored free public 
theater as part of the W.P.A.) It is 
their belief that the theaters are 
harboring left-wing influences. 
They fear that they are encouragThe Cradle Will Rock features an 
all-star cast and is accordingly 
well acted. Emily Watson is excel
lent as Olive Stanton, providing 
significant depth to her role. Joan 
Cusack is terrific as a frightened 
young clerk who testifies against

Funding has been cut, and the

has been canceled. However, the

ducer are not ready to go quietly,

the communist forces that she 
perceives working within the the
ater. Other notable names include 
Hank Azaria, Ruben Blades, John 
Cusack, and Bill Murray.
The Cradle Will Rock is excel
lently directed. Combining an 
interesting style and good pacing,
Tim Robbins creates a visually 
stimulating motion picture. 
Scenes flow well as Robbins cov
ers a wealth of information. He 
creates a truly enjoyable moviegoing experience.
If The Cradle Will Rock possesses 
a weakness, it is in the writing. 
Many subplots are introduced, but 
some dont really go anywhere. 
Things can easily become confus
ing, as Robbins spends little time 
providing the viewer with back
ground information. His greatest 
shortcoming is in his attempt to 
say something profound. Instead 
of exploring the complicated 
issues that it involves, The Cradle 
Will Rock ends up preaching to the 
viewer, making the issues appear 
clear-cut.
While not a perfect movie, The 
Cradle Will Rock is worth seeing. 
Robbins provides the viewer 
with a stylistic, visually stimulat
ing movie. The cast is exception
ally famous, with predictably 
good performances from most 
members. The plot is interesting, 
and the shortcomings are minor. 
I would especially recommend 
this movie to fans of period 
pieces.
New Music
Movie soundtrack is a near-knockout
Album Title: The Hurricane: 
Music from and Inspired by 
the Motion Picture 
Artist: Various 
Label: MCA
Release Date: Jan. 11, 2000iWV'vr
out of four stars
by Andy Francis
Staff Writer
It would have been easy, and perhaps fitting, for the producers 
of The Hurricane to stuff the films soundtrack full of Rocky-style 
anthems and get-the-adrenaline-pumping songs. Instead, The
Hurricane: Music from and Inspired by the Motion Picture features an 
eclectic mix of hip-hop, blues, and  of course  Bob Dylan, that 
conveys the feelings of unfairness, desperation, and eventual tri
umph surrounding wrongly convicted boxer Rubin Hurricane 
Carter.
It is tempting to think how good the soundtrack may have been 
had all of the songs been named Hurricane, considering that 
Dylans 1975 classic and the Roots hip-hop take of the same name 
rank as the two best cuts on the album. While musically the two 
tracks have little in common, the Roots update nearly achieves 
the exquisite lyrical quality that made Dylans song so good in the 
first place.
About half of the recordings on The Hurricane are brand new 
and, with the exception of the Roots and Black Star, are generally 
the discs low points. K-Ci and JoJos saccharine One More 
Mountain (Free Again) is by-the-numbers R&B schlock  this 
tune probably should have been relegated to a NOW collection. 
Still, it sounds like genius next to Meshell Ndegeocellos 
Isolation, which some critics might label as mellow or 
thoughtful, but which I choose to describe as stupid.
Fortunately, songs like Ray Charless Hard Times No One 
Knows and Gil Scott-Herons The Revolution Will Not Be 
Televised, along with the records other oldies, lend the album 
some emotional weight. Charless simple blues capture Carters 
ordeals behind bars, while Scott-Herons jazzy, poetic song grabs 
the listener and doesnt let go until his message has been powerful
ly delivered.
The Hurricane is a film that asks its viewers to consider the injus
tice done to Rubin Carter and contemplate what sort of society 
could allow such a thing to happen. As Christopher Youngs con
templative orchestral piece The Suite closes out the album, its 
clear that, for the most part, the pictures soundtrack does the 
same.

The Butcher Boy
Thursday, January 27
Whats wrong? Your second week of class didnt go quite as 
smoothly as the first? Well, heres a movie from director Neil Jordan 
(The Crying Game') thatll cheer you right up.
First, start with an alcoholic father and a suicidal mother. 
Fortunately, the son is very loyal to his parents and vows that he will 
never let his mother kill herself while hes around. But perhaps hes 
a bit too loyal. When a neighbor begins spreading nasty rumors 
about the boys folks, the boy flips out and kills the neighbor. The 
boy is eventually committed to an asylum. Meanwhile, the boy has 
visions of a woman named Our Lady who is played by Sinead 
OConnor, nominee for most ironic casting in a motion picture. 
(Dont worry, Pope pictures in this movie remain intact.)
This movie has a bunch of interesting plot twists, like The Crying 
Game where the woman turned out to be a man. Uh ... I mean ... 
Man! What a great movie that was!

Three Kings
Friday, January 28
Alcoholism, testicular cancer, bed wetting, Three Kings. These are 
all events for which there are support groups. Since you may be 
unfamiliar with the last one, heres a little explanation of its pur
pose, which is two-fold.
First of all, the meeting is for those who first saw advertisements 
and didnt want to envision themselves paying money for it. The 
main reason is because of the lead actors: George Clooney, Mark 
Wahlberg, and Ice Cube. Anyway, when the movie gets good rat
ings, and the reluctant moviegoers go see the movie and find it riv
eting, some may feel ashamed. But fear not, thats what the group 
is for. Also, the support group is for those who are still recovering 
from the films powerful message: war is stupid, as Boy George (the 
singer, not Clooney) would say.
You probably wont need to join the support group, but this excel
lent movie may definitely change the way you look at the nature of 
warfare.

Saturday, Januaiy 29
Here you go. This is the movie that you wanted to see last semes
ter while all of your friends saw it ten times. This film is where you 
get to watch dark suburbia in all of its SUV glory, led by an all-star 
cast that includes Kevin Spacey and Annette Benning. Spacey plays 
a middle-aged husband and father whose life (and family) is rapid
ly falling apart. Fortunately, a crush on one of his daughter's 
teenage friends gives him a little dosage of hope.
Make sure you watch this movie now, or youll regret it when 
Oscar time rolls around.

If you saw Trainspotting, you may remember a few scenes where 
Robert Carlyles character, the short Scottish dude with a mustache 
and an extremely short fuse, looked like he was going to kill some
one. In fact, you may have thought that he was so aggressive, that 
he would not just kill, but also devour the poor person who got in 
his way.
Well, guess what. In this movie, he plays a cannibal! A captain 
from the Mexican-American War is sent to work at Fort Spencer, 
where he learns about tales of survival and cannibalism from 
George Carlyles character and begins to investigate.
Before you cop that holier-than-thou Im not a cannibal and Ill 
hate this movie attitude, Ive heard that there may be free human 
cake at the showing. Yum.

THE TARTAN  JANUARY 24, 2000Old-style Italy makes its way into Bloomfield eatery
DINING OUT
by Becca Fribush we were sure we werent going to starve ing fun and comfortable rather than stress- seafood. Over the friendly sounds of dinner- found the lineuini with broccoli iby Becca Fribush
Contributing Editor
Lots of Italian restaurants strive to be seri
ously trendy, serving up dishes like blackpepper sage pasta sprinkled with goat 
cheese in portions so small they hurt. Not 
DAmicos. This Bloomfield restaurant is 
refreshingly old-school, from the lacy cur
tains at the windows to the homemade 
spumoni for dessert. Dinner at DAmicos 
feels like a meal in your Italian grandmoth
ers dining room.
The laid-back, pastel-and-beige interior 
and the friendly, talkative waitstaff gave 
me a sense of eating with family from the 
very beginning. If some of the pictures on 
the walls were a little cheesy and some of 
the furniture looked a little worn, that 
was all just part of the mood at most 
places.
On the night we went, the service was a 
little slow at times, but we were so comfort
able and our waitress was so nice about 
apologizing and making sure we were well 
taken care of that we didnt mind the wait at 
all. Besides, we welcomed the chance to 
digest between courses. The waitress 
-seemed especially eager to make sure we got 
enough to eat, asking us a couple of times if
we were sure we werent going to starve 
while waiting between courses.
She neednt have worried. Portions are 
huge and delicious and its nearly impossible 
not to leave utterly stuffed. The high quality 
and reasonable prices make it especially easyDAmicos Italian Restaurant
ing fun and comfortable rather than stress
ful. Plus, more likely than not, youll wind up 
with at least enough food left over for the 
next days lunch.
We started out with fried zucchini, sliced 
to the perfect thinness and served with a
seafood. Over the friendly sounds of dinnertable conversation, I could almost hear the 
saturated fat calling my name.
Spaghetti with marinara sauce and porci
ni mushrooms tasted like Italian comfort 
food  simple but good and filling.

to justify eating massive amounts of food. A tomatolicious side of marinara sauce. Next Linguini alia Luciano  with shrimp, calameal at DAmicos isnt cheap by any dfini- came the pasta. DAmicos features linguine, mari, garlic, peppers, and umpteen other
tion  most entres run somewhere fettuccine, and spaghetti with every combi- vegetables and spices  also was excellent,
between $11 and $16  but it offers good nation of toppings known to man, with a with special bonus points for flavorful
value in an atmosphere that makes fine din- special concentration on cheese and seafood even in the middle of winter. We
found the linguini with broccoli and 
(insane amounts of) ricotta to be tempting 
but so rich and cheesy that finishing it was 
a lost cause. And just in case all of these 
mountains of pasta werent enough, each 
entree came with soup and a good house 
salad. For the salads, dont miss the creamy 
gorgonzola dressing for that extra touch of 
dairy goodness.
Yet after all this bounty, we somehow still 
had room for dessert. A bourbon-laced 
chocolate pecan pie, while not particularly 
Italian, provided an appropriately rich end
ing to the meal, as did a huge, generously 
rum-soaked serving of tiramisu.
Slightly lighter but equally tasty was that 
homemade spumoni, which turned out to be 
a scoop of strawberry ice cream studded 
with fruits, nuts, and chocolate, instead of 
the more common striped block of ice 
cream.
As we left DAmicos with doggie bags in 
our hands and lots of food in our stomachs, 
we knew we'd be back. Italian food this good 
is impossible to resist for long.
DAmicos is on 4744 Liberty Avenue in 
Bloomfield. To get there, catch a 54C going 
towards the North Side. Either that, or find a 
friend with a car.

Hey there, kiddies! Well, Momos 
back in action, and entering her 
fourth century. Did you think she 
would desert you at the dawn of a new 
semester? Take her indispensable 
advice and your second century might 
be almost as decent as hers was. Not! 
Loser-say-what?
Aquarius
(January 20 - February 18)
The Super Bowl is going to suck 
this year* and I blame you, Aqua 
Barbie. The zodiac gods give you 
just two things to take care of in 
your month. Youve already messed 
up Valentines Day, which is virtual
ly nonexistent at CMU. Now youve 
got a crappy Super Bowl. How many 
real football fans are there in 
Nashville or St. Louis? The commer
cials better be damn good.
Pisces
(February 19 - March 20)
Well, Pisces, I do hope youve 
been keeping warm enough now 
that Pittsburgh seems to be confus
ing itself with Alaska. Momos been 
staying toasty by curling up with a 
real babe. Babe the Pig, that is.. Who 
needs an electric blanket when you 
have a nice warm snout nuzzling 
you all night long?
Aries
(March 21 - April 19)
You paranoid loser! I told you that 
the only Y2K bug was in your 
Pokemon-sized head! Well, I hate to 
see all your canned food and apoca
lyptic shelter go to waste. Why dont 
I just shack up in your shack then, 
eh? We /could generate twice the 
heat that was missing from 
Morewood last week.
Taurus
(April 20 - May 20)
So, Mr. Big Stuff. Youve been 
boasting that your classes are pretty 
easy, huh? Get with it, you little 
punk. Glasses are supposed to be 
easy the first week. Did you think 
ybu were special or something? 
With that kind of attitude, good luck 
getting to second base.
Gemini
(May 21 - June 21)
Sit and be fit. Sure, let all the oth
ers laugh at this geriatric form of 
exercise commonly seen on PBS 'But 
those a^e the people who will be sit
ting on their fat behinds and watch
ing Road Rules marathons when 
their New Years exercise resolu
tions have expired by early 
February Meanwhile, with me on 
your lap, youll sit and be fit for life. 
One, two, one, two...
Cancer
(June 22 - July 22)
Youve got to stop berating other 
people so much, C. Okay, so perhaps 
that dude on Who Wants To Be A 
Millionaire? totally wasted all three 
of his lifelines on the $300 nursery 
rhyme question; But he was nervous 
as hell-and didnt know if he should 
quit or. not. How could you say No 
to Regis? I certainly couldnt.
Leo
(July 23 - August 22)
Its time for you to stop bitching 
and moaning about the prices of 
books. Read my lips: They are an 
investment. But seriously, though, 
you only need one book. Its called 
The Book of Love, written by yours 
truly,, with a forward by Burt 
Bacharach. And by looking at the 
history file in your Web browser, 
this is one investment that you sore
ly need, you perv.
Virgo
(August 23 - September 22)
Virgy, baby. Did you possibly 
think that I would treat you the way 
I treat the others? Of course not! 
Youre a pal and a confidant. If you 
threw a party and invited everyone 
you knew; you would see that the 
biggest gift would be from me. 
Thank you for being a friend! (Now 
just because I can spew out the 
Golden Girls theme song on demand 
doesnt mean that Im Bea Arthur. 
Im extremely disappointed that you 
would propagate such rumors, 
Virgy. Bea Arthur is Marilyn 
Manson, you tool.)
Libra
(September 23 - November 23)
Looks like someone woke up on 
the wrong side of the self-esteem 
bed this morning. Do you honestly 
believe that you need those things 
to lose weight? Leebs, youre beauti
ful! Besides, those oily discharges 
are not pleasant.
Scorpio
(October 24 - November 21)
Hey, maybe if you got a damn 
haircut once in a while, people 
would stop , making fun of your 
chops. They look good on Beck, not 
you. Maybe you could gp, with .Tom 
Cruise; I saw Magnolia over the 
break, and I must say my fomjny 
needs to go back to his Top Gun hair 
days, (thats right, I said my 
Tommy. That Rosie ODonnell needs 
to keep her.paws off!)
Sagittarius
(November 22 - December 21)
I must say, Saggy, that you have no 
ambition. Case in point: just look at 
the snack youre eating while read
ing my breathtaking horoscopes. 
The problem is, theyre not sun
flower seeds,r:theyre-sunf:lowerkernels. If youre too lazy to crack the 
seeds yourself, then youll miss out 
on a lot of life! (Besides, when Im 
not writing my; horoscopes, I have a 
part-time job at; the sunflower kernel 
warehouse. A bunch of old women 
and I hover over a conveyer belt, 
cracking the shells and spitting the
kernels into your bag. Bon apptit!)
Capricorn
(December 22 - January 19)
God, youre pathetic, Cappy. What 
you planned to do over the break: 
finally start your career as a strong 
yet sensitive singer-sorigwriter. What 
you actually did: plop '^Ourself on 
your parents floral-print couch 
while eating bowls of popcorn and 
watching endless Behind the Music 
specials on Alanis Morrissette. Isnt it 
ironic, dont you think?
