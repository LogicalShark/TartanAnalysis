Strategic Task Force plans Seminars
By CHRISTINA WONG
Tartan Staffwriter
Starting next fall, Monday Seminars, a 
recommendation of the Strategic Plan
ning Task Force on Broadening Educa
tion, will be instituted as a regular part of 
the Carnegie Mellon community.
We would like to get the community 
together in some kind of intellectual 
activity, said Indira Nair, vice provost 
for education. In the meantime, Nair 
said that there will be a few seminars 
that will occur as an initial trial.
One goal for these _____________
Monday Seminars, 
which will be initially 
implemented by the 
Education Task Force, 
will be to help bring the 
Carnegie Mellon com
munity and the differ
ent colleges within Car
negie Mellon together in 
ways that regular 
classes do not.
We hope to develop a series of semi
nars along the lines of themes, said 
James Corbett, a fourth-year engineer
ing and public policy graduate student 
and one of the students on the Education 
Task Force. Corbett said that the Task 
Force would like to introduce topics that 
will encourage interaction among stu
dents, faculty, undergraduate students, 
and graduate students.
The seminars will consist of lectures 
and discussions that will be held on
dents will be able to attend the seminars 
if they so choose.
One student didnt feel that Monday 
would be the best time for the seminars. 
I dont know if you would want to sit 
through a seminar if youve sat through 
class all day, said Calvin Quek, a fourthyear architecture student. [The semi
nars] might be better on the weekend.
According to the Strategic Plan on 
Broadening Education, this time should 
be designated as seminar time during 
which student clubs and organizations 
would be requested not meet.
[We hope] the kinds of [themes] that 
will be included will be ... topics that 
have been in the news that other uni
versities are dealing with.

[The seminars] could be something 
people can plan around, and can plan 
for. It may be a lecture that is already 
happening, said Nair. If someone in 
the faculty is bringing [a guest speaker], 
maybe [the guest speaker] could be 
brought for Monday.
Some of the lectures were already sched
uled to take place on a Monday, and are 
being included in the list of seminars for 
the Monday series. Nair said that the
ter. On Febuary 8, there will be a seminar 
titled, Integrity: How, Whom, and Why 
We Cheat. The panel for that seminar 
includes Provost Paul Christiano, design 
professor Craig Vogel, English graduate 
student Julia Deems, and Matthew Vojik, 
a senior in civil and evironmental engi
neering. On Febuary 15, there will be a 
presentation given by President Jared 
Cohon, the topic yet to be announced. 
Walter Alverez, this years Dickson Prize 
winner, will be a guest speaker on March 
8. He will be giving a lecture called T. Rex 
and the Crater of Doom in the Carnegie
___________ Lecture Hall.
We are also thinking of 
a theme for the [fall] se
mester. One theme we are 
planning for in the fall 
is Community and Con
flict,  said Nair. In addi
tion, Nair mentioned other 
themes including talks on 
ethics and sustainable architecture, as well as an 
assortment of speakers. 
Weve talked to the mayors office about 
possibly getting the mayor, she said.
Corbett said, [We hope] the kinds of 
[themes] that will be included will be 
ones like integrity in your professional 
and personal lives, and topics that have 
been in the news that other universities 
are dealing with.

This past week, many students re
turning to campus housing have expe
rienced problems ranging from water 
damage to limited heat and hot water 
due to several incidents of frozen pipes 
and the failure of a heating valve on the 
Hill. As the University makes the tran
sition to full occupancy for the semes
ter, students are replacing damaged 
belongings while Facilities Manage
ment Services responds to maintenance 
calls and mobilizes for installation of a 
new heating valve once the replace
ment arrives.
Bob Wilson, associate director of Hous
ing Services, attributes the problems 
partly to the conditions. [Weve had] 
more problems than the years previous, 
but weve had some pretty severe 
weather, he said.
Over break, pipes froze and broke in 
bothMorewood Gardens and West Wing, 
resultingin water damage. InMorewood, 
a suite in D-Tower, the resident staffs 
resource room on the first floor, and 
laundry facilities in the basement all 
flooded as a result. In West Wing, fan 
coil units broke, causing water damage 
in several suites.
Its hard to pinpoint a specific cause 
for these things, Wilson said. I think in 
Morewood, a window was left open, and 
in West Wing, I think it was a result of 
students turning their heating systems 
off. But we cant say conclusively. We 
definitely need to change the way we

Mondays from 4:30 to 6:30 pm. This time Martin Luther King Jr. will be the type of run of seminars will be open to anyone 
chosen in the hopes that more stu- seminars that will be offered next semes- who would like to attend.
close down for the break. The incident 
is not the first case of flooding 
in West Wing.
The water damage has been 
happening for three years, at least 
in my suite, and they should 
have solved this problem by 
now, said Tracey Wortham, a junior 
computer science and psychology 
double major.
Housing is encouraging students to 
contact their insurance carriers in order 
to replace damaged items. The policy of 
the University is not to take responsibil
ity for student property, Wilson said. 
As a courtesy in a situation like this, we 
try to reimburse students for any de
ductible amounts that theyre respon
sible for paying.
In the last week, a number of local
ized problems have affected the avail
ability of heat and hot water in differ
ent dorms at different times. Wilson 
referred to incidents in Morewood DandE-Towers where small blockages 
and other maintenance issues left stu
dents there with limited hot water and 
cold rooms. If you shower during the 
peak . hours, the waters only 
lukewarm. Its a supply-and-demand 
situation, said Mary Wall, a fifth-year 
senior in creative writing and a com
munity advisor for Morewood C- and 
D- towers. It makes going outside just 
a tiny bit more desirable its warmer 
there, said Susan Dernyar, a fresh
man design major and resident of 
D-tower.

SEI beats out Bell Labs
By SRIRAM GOLLAPALLI
Tartan Staffwriter
This award is really for the many 
world-class software engineers and vis
iting scientists who publish articles for 
SEI, said Bill Poliak, Public Relations 
Coordinator for the Software Engineer
ing Institute (SEI) at CMU.
SEI was recently honored as the num
ber one institution for publishing schol
arly articles in the field of systems and 
software engineering (SSE). It is a trib
ute to both Carnegie Mellon University 
and the Software Engineering Institute, 
said Poliak.
An article in the JournalofSystemsand 
Software, issue 43, entitled, An assess
ment of systems and software engineeringscholars and institutions (1993-1997), 
by R.L. Glass, rates the SEI. This is based 
on the frequency of publication in leading 
journals in the SSE field.
For the first year since the study began, 
there is a new institution at the top of the 
list. Carnegie Mellon University, wrote 
Glass, surpassed the perennial leader,
Bell Labs (Lucent)... Bell Labs had been 
number one, and CMU number two, for 
the previous several years of this study. 
The SEI is also celebrating its 10th 
anniversary as the Computer Emergency 
Response Team Coordination Center 
(CERT/CC). The Defense Advanced Re
search Projects Agency (DARPA) charged 
the SEI with setting up a center to coor
dinate communication among experts 
during security emergencies and to help 
prevent future incidents.
Fifteen years ago, the Department of 
Defense (DOD) put a bid to a software 
engineering institute to help with the 
software crisis at the time, said Poliak. 
It was hard to develop a world-class 
institute for the DOD, but we won the 
bid. Now we administer the Software 
Engineering Institute for the DOD. 
The Institute employs an advanced 
group of software engineers who are 
funded by the DOD. Our mission is to 
provide leadership in advancing the state 
of the practice of software engineering to 
improve the quality of systems that de
pend on software, said Poliak.
Student Senate introduces new way for students to buy books online
By ISH HARSHAWAT
Tartan News Editor
Students used to standing in 
long lines at the University 
Shoppe and scouring bulletin 
boards for good deals 
were introduced to a new option 
for purchasing books this 
semester. Booksmart, an online 
Web auctioning system provided 
by Student Senate, began its 
trial run around November 
10 and will continue into the 
month of February.
From what I can tell 
IBooksmart] been very success
ful, said Robb Moskowitz, a se
ttlor information and decision 
systems (IDS) major and InterQal Affairs Committee Chair 
for Student Senate who adminis
ters Booksmart.
Booksmart started as a project 
for a Structured Analysis and 
Design course last spring in which 
the objective was to identify a 
problem and come up with a solu
tion. We noticed there werent 
many options for books besides 
the University Bookstore, 
Moskowitz said.
John Miller, the IDS program 
director, said, Booksmart is typi
cal of our IDS projects: usable 
systems designed to do useful 
things. After the project was com
pleted, Moskowitz brought 
Booksmart to the Campus Af
fairs Committee of Student Sen
ate, and the idea to provide the 
Web site as a service to students 
was later approved.
The Web site allows students 
to post books they wish to sell and 
set a reserve price. This price is
the minimum price at which the stu
dent is obligated to sell their book. 
Students looking to buy books search 
the database and place bids on them. 
Both buyer and seller are notified by 
email when a new bid is placed. The 
highest bidder is obligated to buy the 
book, but the seller is given a list of the 
top five bidders in case this is 
not possible.
I buy my books at the bookstore full 
price because Im lazy, said Nina 
Verma, a first-year student in H&SS. 
She added, I would use [Booksmart] if
I knew computers better.
Supply and demand determine 
prices on Booksmart, which means 
that, in the end, everyone using it wins, 
said Georgios Markakis, a senior in 
electrical and computer engineering 
and one of the designers of 
the system.

Brazilian woes renew 
global economic crisis
WASHINGTON (AP)  A twomonth calm in world financial mar
kets vanished suddenly as Brazil be
came last week the latest victim of a 
revived global economic crisis. The 
firewall that the Clinton administra
tion and the International Monetary 
Fund had erected around Latin 
Americas largest economy proved just 
as ineffectual as past efforts to contain ' 
the spreading contagion.
Brazil relinquished, at least for now, 
a defense of its currency, the real, and 
let it trade openly on foreign exchange 
markets. The decision encouraged for
eign investors, who saw it as a hopeful 
sign Brazilian authorities would not 
waste scarce reserves on a losing battle 
against currency speculators.
But even with Fridays 219-point 
rally, the Dow Jones industrial aver
age dropped 303 points for the week. 
And the message from analysts to in
vestors is: Brace for more bad weeks 
ahead. The Brazilian crisis is ongoing 
and open-ended, said Allen Sinai, chief 
global economist for Primark Decision 
Economics in New York. The after
shocks are likely to be substantial.
Economists worry that Brazils 
economy will plunge even deeper into 
recession as the weaker currency sets 
off severe inflation. Trouble in Brazil, 
which accounts for half of Latin 
Americas economic output, could 
quickly drag down its neighbors. Most 
of Latin America will now fall into 
recession, and there could be spillover 
effects in other emerging markets, 
said Merrill Lynch chief economist 
Bruce Steinberg.
Weakness in Latin America, which 
buys 20 percent of American exports, 
would mean more bad news for Ameri
can manufacturers and farmers. Al
ready they are suffering from a steep 
drop in exports to Asia, where the 
global financial crisis first struck in 
mid-1997.
In addition to threateningto increase 
Americas trade deficit, the troubles in 
Latin America pose a risk to hundreds
of U.S. corporations with operations 
in the region. Overseas operations ac
counted for almost a third of U.S. cor
porations earnings.
Economists also worry that growing 
economic ills in Latin Americas devel
oping nations will cause more insta
bility in financial markets around the 
world. Such turbulence could jolt con
sumer confidence in the United States.
Also helping to stabilize markets 
was a $41.5-billion package of finan
cial support for Brazil that the Clinton 
administration convinced the IMF to 
assemble in November. The idea was 
to provide Brazil with a sizable line of 
reserves to ward off attacks from cur
rency speculators.
The plan started to unravel when 
Brazilian President Fernando 
Henrique Cardoso could not make 
good on the government belt-tighten
ing promises he made to justify the 
IMF support.
Brazilian financial authorities 
were in Washington this weekend to 
meet with IMF and U.S. Treasury 
officials in hopes of revamping 
Brazils economic program to restore 
investor confidence.
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin 
said Friday the key to resolving the 
crisis lies in Brazils showing the re
solve to honor its commitments.
Whatever judgment one makes on 
exchange rate regimes and the rest, 
it always comes back to the same 
thing  having sound policies at 
home, he said.
The Clinton administration has 
much riding on its handling of the 
Brazilian crisis.
Last year, the administration used 
a strong lobbying campaign to over
come Republican objections in Con
gress to providing an additional $18 
billion in U.S. support to the IMF.
The administration contended the 
money would help keep the Asian cri
sis from striking closer to home in 
Latin America. Brazil was seen as a 
crucial test for that strategy.

NEW YORK (AP)  Rapper 01 Dirty 
Bastard was arrested on a charge of 
attempted murder after a shootout with 
police  the latest addition to a growing 
nonmusical rap sheet. It was his fourth 
arrest since July.
Russell Jones, the real name of the 
Wu-Tang Clan singer also known as Big 
Baby Jesus, and another man were driv
ing a sport utility vehicle with its head
lights off when police tried to pull them 
over in Brooklyn on Friday.
An unmarked police car with four plain
clothes officers chased Jones after he tried 
to flee, police said. He was later pulled 
over and when two officers approached, 
two shots were fired from the drivers side, 
police said. Police returned fire as Jones 
drove off again. No one was injured.
Another police car stopped Jones a few 
blocks away and he was arrested. Police 
found the second man shortly after in a 
nearby building and questioned him. He 
was released and was not charged in the 
incident, said Officer Olga Mercado, an 
NYPD spokeswoman.
Jones, 29, pleaded innocent Saturday 
to charges of attempted murder in the 
second degree, attempted murder of a 
police officer in the first degree, and 
criminal possession of a weapon. Bail 
was set at $150,000 and Jones was or
dered to reappear in court Jan. 21.
Jones attorney, Peter Frankel, said 
the passenger told police that his client 
did not have a gun. Our version is that 
he was pulled over by an unmarked po
lice car. Undercover police officers came 
at him with guns drawn.... He drove off 
and they fired shots at him. He feared for 
his life, he said. There is no evidence... 
that Russell Jones fired a weapon.
In November, he allegedly threatened 
to kill his former girlfriendthe mother 
of their 1-year-old child  after climb
ing over a security gate to enter the 
property where she worked.
He was charged with threatening to 
kill security officers last September at a 
blues club in West Hollywood, Calif., 
and in July he allegedly stole a pair of 
shoes in Virginia.
Jones has faced various larceny, as
sault and fraud charges going back to 
1987, Mercado said. Hes also been ac
cused of being a deadbeat dad for failing 
to pay court-mandated child support to 
three of his children, police said.
At the Grammy Awards last year, 
Jones crashed the stage and hijacked a 
microphone from singer Shawn Colvin. 
Angry at having lost in the best rap 
album category to Sean Puff Daddy 
Combs, Jones complained that he had 
spent a lot of money for new clothes 
because he thought he would win.

LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP)  Pharma
ceutical manufacturer Pfizer Inc. says it 
has filed for a patent on a nasal-spray 
version ofits anti-impotence drug Viagra.
The company made the announcement 
Friday in response to two University of 
Kentucky researchers who claimed this 
week to have developed such a spray.
Were certainly not ready to specu
late in terms of when well have a prod
uct out, said Pfizer spokeswoman 
Mariann Caprino. We are moving for
ward in terms of investigating this as a 
potential delivery system.
Pfizer said the spray was developed 
and tested in England, but offered no 
other details.
The two UK College of Pharmacy pro
fessors, Lewis Dittert and Anwar 
Hussain, reported this week that the 
spray theyve developed drops the time 
it takes Viagra to take effect from over 
an hour to five to 15 minutes.
Dittert released a statement Friday in 
response to Pfizers claim that it also has 
a nasal version of Viagra in the works.
They did not tell us they had a patent 
application in this area, Dittert said.

MINNEAPOLIS (AP)  The governor 
arrived Saturday night wearingpink wrap
around sunglasses, a bandana on his bald 
head, three earrings and a Jimi Hendrix 
T-shirt. His wife wore black leather.
The Bodys back for tonight. Thank 
you, everyone. Lets party, Minnesota. 
So declared Gov. Jesse Ventura at an 
inaugural ball as unorthodox as his cam
paign. And his supporters  more than 
13,000 of them  loved it.
Its sort of a political event, but its 
more of a peoples event, a celebration, 
said Sherry Nielsen, 51, of Sauk Rapids. 
The whole concept of his party is that 
everyone can come, not just the upper 
echelon, and I think that whole concept 
is kind of exciting.
The inaugural party was, in fact, dubbed 
The Peoples Celebration by organiz
ers. The University of Minnesota march
ing band brought the crowd to its feet 
with Minnesota Rouser and then a video 
montage traced Venturas path from the 
campaign trail to the statehouse as 
Minnesotas Reform Party governor.
Beerflowedmorefreelythan champagne, 
and jeans far outnumbered tuxedos.
Tim Wones, 21, arrived in a T-shirt 
bearing the slogan: The Governor is 
Ready to Rumble. I was a fan of his 
when he was wrestling, too, Wones said 
of the former professional wrestler nick
named The Body.
Teen blues guitarist Jonny Lang, a 
personal favorite ofVenturas, headlined 
the evenings entertainment, and War
ren Zevon was also on the bill.
The 13,800 tickets, ranging from $10 
to $20, were scooped up in a little over a 
day last month. Those who were unable 
to get tickets could watch the show on 
the Internet or on public TV stations.

MADRID, Spain (AP)Spanish police 
recovered $35 million in stolen paintings 
including works by Picasso, Rembrandt, 
and Goya, and arrested two people who 
allegedly wanted to trade the art for co
caine, authorities said Saturday.
The suspects were arrested Thursday 
after leading police bn a high-speed chase 
in the Valencia region of southeastern 
Spain. A third person whom police iden
tified as a daughter of one of the sus
pects was also detained.
Police found art in the back seat of the 
car including pre-Columbian figurines 
and oil paintings by Picasso, Rembrandt, 
Goya, Chagall, and Miro.
Police said they later searched the house 
of one of the suspects, identified only as 
Cladis R.P., and found more stolen art.
The suspects had planned to trade the 
art for cocaine to be supplied by foreign 
drug traffickers, a police statement said 
without giving further details.Serbians slay dozens in worst massacre of Kosovo conflict
RACAK, Yugoslavia (AP)  
Scattered on a Kosovo hillside 
and heaped together in a 
muddy gully, the bodies of 45 
ethnic Albanians were found 
shot or mutilated Saturday in 
what appears to be the worst 
killing spree of the nearly yearold conflict. International 
monitors expressed horror at 
the grisly discovery, which 
came a day after Serb forces 
attacked the area in southern 
Kosovo. The killings present 
the gravest threat yet of a re
turn to full-scale combat in the 
separatist province.
Some of the dead had their 
eyes gouged out or heads 
smashed in, and one man lay 
decapitated in the courtyard of
his compound. The victims in
cluded one young woman and a 
12-year-old boy and many were 
older men, including one of age 
70. Many had been shot at close 
range, and residents of Racak 
village said Serb forces had 
rounded up the men, driven 
them up the hill, and shot them. 
Twenty-eight of the bodies lay 
at the bottom of a narrow ra
vine. All the victims were 
dressed in civilian clothing, de
spite the insistence of Serb po
lice that most of the terrorists 
wore uniforms of the rebel 
Kosovo Liberation Army.
Visibly upset and his voice 
shaking after visiting the site, 
William Walker, the U.S. head of 
the Kosovo monitoring mission,
called it a massacre, an unspeak
able atrocity, and a crime very 
much against humanity.
World leaders voiced shock and 
anger. President Clinton con
demned the massacre in the 
strongest possible terms. This 
was a deliberate and indiscrimi
nate act of murder designed to 
sow fear among the people of 
Kosovo, he said.
In Brussels, NATO SecretaryGeneral Javier Solana warned 
that the alliance will not toler
ate a return to all-out fighting 
and a policy of repression 
in Kosovo.
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi 
Annan called for a full investiga
tion, saying he was shocked and 
gravely concerned.
In Kosovo, ethnic Albanian po
litical leader Ibrahim Rugova re
newed his call for NATO inter
vention after the cruel attack. 
KLA representative Adem 
Demaci called on all Kosovo Al
banians to rally behind the rebel 
force. The murder of children 
shows that Belgrade wants to 
destroy [ethnic] Albanians fu
ture, his office said in a state
ment. The regime does not want 
any political solution, just Kosovo 
as a colony, not only occupied but 
without Albanians.
The Albanian government ac
cused the Serbs of attempting 
genocide, and it denounced the 
massacre as a fascist act.
The U.N. Yugoslav war crimes 
tribunal in The Hague, Nether
lands, opened an investigation 
into the massacre, and chief pros
ecutor Louise Arbour was pre
paring to go to Kosovo with or 
without permission from 
Yugoslav authorities.
Verifiers and journalists came 
across the carnage on Saturday 
morning in Racak, 15 miles south 
of the provincial capital, Pristina, 
after having been barred 
from the site by Serbian police 
the previous day.
The wails of women discover
ing the loss of their men could be 
heard as residents who had evacu
ated on Friday returned. One by 
one the monitors counted the bod
ies, which they said numbered 
45. The KLA later claimed it had 
counted 51 dead, including a 3-
month-old baby, which could not 
be confirmed.
It was the highest single death 
toll  and perhaps the bloodiest 
spree of the nearly yearlong con
flict  since an Oct. 12 truce 
brokered by U.S. envoy Richard 
Holbrooke with Yugoslav Presi
dent Slobodan Milosevic that 
largely halted more than seven 
months of combat in the separat
ist province of Serbia.
As many as 2,000 people, mostly 
ethnic Albanians, have been 
killed since Milosevic launched 
an offensive last -February to 
try to crush separatist militants 
and reinforce government con
trol over the Albanian-majority 
province in Serbia, the larger re
public in Yugoslavia.

50 YEARS AGO, January 12, 
1949  The editor of the campus 
humor magazine The Scottie was 
faced with the resignations of vir
tually all members of the 
magazines staff.
The editor, Lee Wiley, said, 
Resignations from the staff, 
particularly en masse, and 
in the manner in which they 
appear to be carrying them out, 
are unjustified.
A letter appeared in the De
cember issue of the magazine 
explaining the reasons for 
the mass resignation as being 
primarily objections to actions 
of the review board. A 
speaker for the staff said, The 
difficulties brought on by the 
review board make us feel that 
we cannot accept the responsi
bility of continuing to publish 
the magazine.
25 YEARS AGO, January 15, 
1974  Apathy for student ac
tivities was running so high that 
a proposal was introduced at a 
Student Senate meeting that 
would allow students to not pay 
the Activities Fee.
The proposal said that students 
who were willing to forgo campus 
activities could choose to contrib
ute as little as 25 cents annually 
toward the activities fee. The ac
tivities fee was $25. The proposal 
was originally to apply to gradu
ate students but was later 
amended to include all students.
10 YEARS AGO, January 24, 
1989After more than 16 years 
in office, President Richard M. 
Cyert announced plans to retire, 
signalling the official beginning 
of a year-long search for his suc
cessor. Two search committees
were formed to look for candi
dates nationwide.
Cyert said, It is not an easy 
decision for me to leave a job 
which I love. My heart tells me 
to stay on and on, but my brain 
tells me that the time to leave 
has come. Robert Mehrabian 
was Cyerts successor. Cyert 
died last year.
FIVE YEARS AGO, January 
17,1994The renovation of the 
Margaret Morrison Carnegie 
Building rotunda neared comple

facilities planning and construc
tion, predicted that all of the scaf

Students purchase books online
BOOKS, from page 1
I would use [Booksmart] if it was 
easy to use and relatively foolproof, 
said Reid Patterson, a junior in chemi
cal engineering, I try to get books as 
relatively cheap as possible. Id rather 
get a book from a person.
Booksmart is being funded by the Stu
dent Senate operating budget. Accord
ing to Moskowitz, $50 was spent on the 
software and $900 on promotion, includ
ing flyers around campus. One of the 
difficulties that Booksmart had in its 
trial run was insufficient licenses, which 
allowed for only 10 users at a time. 
Moskowitz said that it is likely that a few 
hundred dollars will be spent to add 
additional licenses for next semester.
According to John Auchter, a senior 
double major in information and deci
sion systems and computer science
and chief programmer of the system , a 
lot of books were set to expire on Janu
ary 12, meaning students would no 
longer be able to place bids on them. 
This bug forced some students to bid 
before they had attended many of their 
classes. However, the system is still 
running, said Auchter.
In addition to the bookstore, 
Moskowitz mentioned the electronic 
bulletin board cmu.misc.market and the 
Alpha Phi Omega (A Phi 0) book sale as 
other places where students may look 
for books. The bboard is unorganized 
and the A Phi O book sale doesnt have 
much selection, said Moskowitz.
Brothers sellingbooks for APhi O showed 
little concern that Booksmart would hurt 
their fraternitys efforts. [With Booksmart] 
you cant actually see the book before you 
buy it, and you cant return it, said
Jonathan Wildstrom, a senior double 
major in computer science and logic.
James Raskob, a sophomore me
chanical engineering major and A Phi
O brother, said, Very few people buy 
their books before classes start. 
Wildstrom was not worried even 
if Booksmart did begin to become 
popular. This is one of many projects 
we do. It will only cost us about $500 of 
money that we end up using for other 
projects, he said.
To date Booksmart has 850 regis
tered users and 300 sales. In addition, 
57 percent of books sold were sold for 
at least the reserve price.
I suspect we will see a lot more 
of these kinds of systems emerging, 
including systems for very 
localized markets like text books for 
CMU students, said Miller.

Housing Services works 
to fix water difficulties
WATER, from page 1
Residents on the Hill are currently 
experiencing problems because of a heat
ing valve that broke last week. The valve 
is one of two that heats the water by 
steam to different portions of campus.
It would be different if the ground 
temperature was not so cold. Then 
the single valve itself would be enough, 
Wilson said. The replacement valve 
is due to arrive today and will 
be immediately installed by 
Facilities Management Services.
Any time we dont have something 
like hot water, we make that a priority. 
Unfortunately with this one [incident], 
the response and repair have been de
layed. We were very discouraged when 
we found out [the replacement valve] 
wasnt going to be here until [today], 
said Wilson.
Residents on the Hill have sent a num
ber of maintenance requests. The waters 
still not cold, but its not hot at all. You 
have to keep turning it up, said Matt 
Gustin, a sophomore in chemical engi
neering and resident of McGill Hall. Hous
ing has identified the hours from 7-9 am 
and 4- 7 pm as times when hot water is in 
highest demand. He encourages Hill resi
dents to minimize their usage of hot water 
during these times.
Even in the best of conditions, these 
things happen, Wilson said. I 
think the weather may have enhanced 
these problems, but I dont think 
its fair to say its all attributable to that. 
None of its that extraordinary, given 
the time of year and the fact that 
everyone returns at once. Buildings 
have been basically empty for a 
few weeks.

FORUM
Carnegie Mellon University18 January 1999
CMU lacks sufficient 
nighttime security
Over the past couple of years, a 
number of security problems have 
surfaced at CMU. Outdoor light
ing is inadequate in some areas 
and improperly maintained in 
others, and the Escort Service does 
not fully service students needs. 
These two factors, as well as the 
loss of the student-run Safewalk 
service, are causing many stu
dents to feel unsafe on campus at 
night. A few simple steps taken 
by both students and administra
tors would vastly improve stu
dents peace of mind when they 
are out at night.
Many parts of the campus, es
pecially near its perimeter, are 
poorly lit, and in other areas, the 
lights are not properly main
tained. The stairs leading down 
from Porter Hall to Scaife Hall 
are not lit at all, and other areas, 
such as the side of the stadium 
closest to Margaret Morrison 
Street and the parking area be
hind Hunt Library, are also inad
equately lit. Steps should be taken 
to improve the lighting in these 
areas, and frequent checks should 
be made to see that lights are 
working all around campus.
Furthermore, gettingfrom place 
to place in the area surrounding 
CMU is problematic at night. 
Many students at CMU live off 
campus, but the Escort Service 
will only take students from cam
pus to their homes, not the other 
way around. The reason for this 
policy is that Escort is currently 
operating at capacity. The service 
will help a stranded student by 
calling a cab (billed to the 
students account). But when one 
considers the large number of 
classes and other activities tak
ing place on campus at night, it 
becomes clear that Escort should 
be expanded so that students can 
use it to get to campus as well as 
to their homes. The policy as it 
stands also implies that Escort 
will not pick up on-campus resi
dents who are out after the last 
shuttle run ends at 10:45 pm, 
forcing them to either call a cab or 
walk home.
An important step that students 
themselves should take is rein
stating Safewalk, which was a 
volunteer organization whose 
members escorted students 
around campus. Poor planning 
and a lack of training and organi
zation caused Safewalk to disap
pear last year. Students need to 
take their safety into their own 
hands by reestablishing this use
ful and much-needed group.
One security precaution that al
ready exists is the emergency 
phones located on campus. Un
fortunately, these phones are 
poorly marked, and many stu
dents are not even aware of their 
existence or locations. On other 
campuses, such as Pitts, bright 
blue lights and large signs mark 
the locations of emergency 
phones. Similar markings would 
improve the visibility of these 
phones at CMU, and thus the 
safety of students.
While CMU is generally a safe 
community, it is important that 
students feel safe both on 
campus and during their com
mute. If students and adminis
trators take the initative to 
supplement the systems that are 
currently in place, CMU and its 
surrounding areas could become 
a much safer environment.

The Supreme Court once again left 
intact the militarys Dont ask, dont 
tell, dont pursue policy on Monday, 
January 11, rejecting a challenge by two 
former servicemen discharged after de
claring their homosexuality. This policy 
exposes the hypocrisy of the 
governments stand on allowing gays 
into the military. It prohibits inquiries 
into a service members sexual orienta
tion but allows discharge for homosexual 
conduct or for a propensity to engage 
in homosexual conduct. Theres a lot 
wrong with this picture. If homosexual 
conduct is truly bad, then why is inquiry 
about service members sexual orienta
tion forbidden? After all, such inquiries 
would help to weed out the so-called 
bad people. And if homosexual con
duct is not bad, then why are people 
fired for engaging in it or for having a 
propensity to engage in it? Theres clearly 
a contradiction here.
The Dont ask, dont tell, dont pur
sue policy is not only hypocritical, but it 
is also pretty short-sighted. Its exclud
ing people from the military solely on 
the basis of their homosexuality, ignor
ing the skills of those people. What if 
those people could contribute to the mili
tary in a positive way? Theres this preju
dice that has been established against 
homosexuals, which doesnt let people 
evaluate them for what they are and for 
what they can contribute to the military. 
It only evaluates them as homosexuals.
Research has shown that sexual ori
entation is largely determined geneti
cally. Even the environmental factors 
that might be responsible for a persons 
sexual orientation, such as the stress 
suffered by the mother during pregnancy, 
are beyond the control of the individual. 
There has been research showing strong 
scientific evidence that belies the com
mon notion of people choosing a gay 
lifestyle. The reality is that they are 
born that way. Therefore, discriminat
ing against gays in the military is pretty 
much like kicking people out because 
they have brown hair or dark eyes.
Government lawyers made the ludi
crous statement that the policy serves 
the legitimate objectives of prohibiting 
homosexual acts in the military, pro
moting unit cohesion, protecting privacy 
interests, and reducing sexual tensions. 
By forcing homosexuals to hide their
sexuality, the policy is heightening 
sexual tensions, not reducing them. In 
ancient Greece, homosexuality was en
couraged, especially among soldiers. The 
idea was that people would form stron
ger bonds, and that would make for a 
more united party, whose members 
would be more likely to protect each 
other. The idea is logical  if someones 
lover were killed, it would make the 
person pretty angry and want to destroy 
the enemy. Prohibiting homosexual acts 
doesnt promote unit cohesion, as the 
lawyers claim.
As a nation, we really need to get over 
this phobia of homosexuals. Policies like 
Dont ask, dont tell, dont pursue are 
only one example of the backward think
ing still persistent in America. A few 
decades ago, there was a similar situa
tion with African-Americans. There was 
racial prejudice in all walks of life. To
day, its the same with gays. The mili
tary and government need to strike down 
policies like that, and to grant people of 
all sexual orientations equal rights, be
cause that is what the Constitution 
guarantees  equality for all people.

The day begins with a hot 
shower for most students at CMU. 
However, for residents of the Hill 
dormitories, the first five days of 
class started with cold showers. 
Although a backup water heater 
was turned on as a temporary 
solution, it was unable to handle 
peak-hour demands, and the 
source of the problem  a faulty 
steam valve  took maintenance 
personnel a week to fix.
The length of time it took to 
replace the valve is one of many 
examples of an all-too-familiar as
pect of the maintenance process 
 Housings inability to handle 
maintenance issues in a timely 
manner. Like any landlord, Hous
ing Services needs to maintain its 
properties efficiently, a process 
which requires faster response 
times and greater reliability than 
what is currently provided.
Last weeks hot-water shortage 
prompted students to send main
tenance requests as early as Mon
day morning. Usually, students 
who file requests receive email 
from Housing soon afterwards, 
acknowledging the request and 
setting an expected date of 
completion. Not until Friday did 
Hill residents receive any kind of 
official acknowledgment of the 
hot-water problem. Furthermore, 
frequent power outages in Donner 
Hall have typically taken several 
hours to repair, even though the
solution is simply to switch a cir
cuit breaker.
When a student submits a main
tenance request, a facility coordi
nator in the Housing office re
views it. If it is approved, the 
coordinator prioritizes the request 
and forwards it to Facilities Man
agement Services. Housing Ser
vices receives as many as 100 
requests per day, depending on 
the time of year.
The problem lies in the ineffi
ciency of the facility coordinators 
who process the requests. The 
target time set for completion of 
most requests is five days, but 
often residents find that a week 
later the work still has not been 
done. At this point, they may very 
well submit another request, and 
as a result, Housing Services be
comes inundated with duplicate 
requests, which only slows the 
process down further. Better esti
mations of completion time would 
help put students at ease, which 
in turn would improve the effi
ciency of request processing.
Students livingin campus hous
ing should expect the same qual
ity of service that they would re
ceive as tenants anywhere else. It 
is Housing Services responsibil
ity to make sure that such service 
is provided, and that requires 
changes be made to improve the 
speed and reliability of its main
tenance process.

Hollywood movies frequently portray 
the Earth as a planet teeming with 
healthy, energetic people. In particular, 
those movies in which malevolent aliens 
plot to take over the world and enslave 
its population usually depict the planet 
as home to a race of lively and vivacious 
potential servants. This is a misconception dangerous to both would-be 
alien potentates and todays 
young people. Human beings are 
a race riddled with debilitating

David Liber
The media in this country 
have decided to focus much of 
their non-impeachment news 
(all two seconds of it) on the 
Salt Lake City Olympic orga
nizing committees attempt to 
gain the 2002 Winter Olympic 
Games by offering certain gifts 
to International Olympic Com
mittee members. However, 
even if Salt Lake City did offer 
such gifts as a ski vacation to 
Utah or tuition for certain 
prestigious American colleges, 
we in the U.S. should be her
alding the Salt Lake City or
ganizers for finally getting lowdown and dirty and compet
ing in the truest of Olympic 
sports  those of bribery and 
corruption.
The International Olympic 
Committee, or IOC, is the most 
corrupt international govern
ing body that has ever existed, 
and we should congratulate 
the Salt Lake City organizers 
for finally competing. Currently, under the mgalomanie 
rule of President Juan Anto
nio Samaranch, the IOC has 
become a very profitable orga
nization by selling the rights 
of every aspect of the games to 
major international compa
nies such as Swatch, CocaCola, and the United Parcel 
Service.
Offering gifts of ski vaca
tions, tuition reimbursements, 
and the like is simply how 
things are done in the IOC. 
Ethics and propriety have 
never been two words associ
ated with the IOC, and for 
good reason. Past IOC Presi
dent Avery Brundage could 
only be described as a true 
fascist, controlling every as
pect of the games, and ulti
mately deciding which city 
was to have the honor of host
ing the games. Under Presi
dent Samaranch, the longestreigning of IOC presidents, the 
summer Olympic Games of 
1992 were awarded to 
Barcelona, a city that, coinci
dentally, happens to be 
Samaranchs hometown.
The modern Olympic 
Games, as envisioned by
founder Baron Pierre de 
Coubertin, are simply about 
sport. To quote Coubertin: 
The most important thing in 
the Olympic Games is not to 
win but to take part, just as 
the most important thing in 
life is not the triumph but the 
struggle. The essential thing 
is not to have conquered, but 
to have fought well. However, 
if these are truly to be the 
modern Olympic Games, 
such aspects as bribery are 
simply par for the course. The 
Olympic Games may be about 
sports, but they are also, and 
more importantly, about poli
tics and money. To the city 
hosting the Olympic Games 
comes the rewards of fame, 
honor, tourists, and an influx 
of money to reinvest in new 
sports arenas and infrastruc
ture. In fact, the Games have 
brought an abundance of new 
cash and services to every city 
who has hosted them.
This is the way the game is 
played. In order for a city to 
win the Games, it must offer 
such gifts as vacations and 
college tuition to countries so 
poor that their representative
members use such gifts as 
their source of income. The 
country of Guinea doesnt 
have enough money to send 
more than one individual to 
the Olympic Games, much 
less pay for a full time IOC 
representative without the 
luxury of these gifts given 
by competing cities.
We should not be con
demning the organizers of 
the Salt Lake City games for 
simply playing the game like 
every other city has in the 
past and every city shall in 
the future. The upsetting 
idea is not that the Salt 
Lake City organizers offered 
bribes to win the games, but 
rather that the organizing 
committee had to offer 
bribes in order to be consid
ered for the games.

Hustler publisher inspires debate over ethics in Washington

Open Forum
by Rob Cullen
Recently, the U.S. House of Repre
sentatives voted to impeach the Presi
dent for having an extramarital affair 
and supposedly lying under oath about 
it. The investigation of President 
Clinton, which led to the impeachment, 
was headed by Kenneth Starr, and 
produced a 500-page report which, at 
$40 million, is probably the most ex
pensive pornographic novel ever writ
ten. So, you have to admit that by itself 
Washington had been doing a pretty 
good job of running the government 
like the porn industry. But, at that 
point, it could still be sinking lower  
I mean, they were just amateurs at the 
whole cheap sex scandal thing. What 
Washington really needed was a pro
fessional degenerate scumsucker and 
all-around lowlife to help it sink to the 
next level of depravity.
Enter Larry Flynt, a man with a 
dream. Years ago, he began his empire 
with just an idea: Take naked women, 
which nearly everyone likes, and put 
them in raunchy positions with ani
mals, farm equipment, and each other. 
This was the man Washington needed 
to show it how to really get dirty. In his 
magazine, Hustler  the magazine for 
those who consider Playboy too highclass  he offered one million dollars 
to anyone who could prove an adulter
ous relationship with a high-ranking 
government official. He said he got 
proof that implicated over a dozen men. 
One of them was Bob Livingston, the 
would-be speaker of the house, who 
resigned because of the scandal.
Flynt has opened the door for a true 
witch-hunt of government officials. 
This offer can do two things: It can 
result in the targeting of people who 
are innocent, possibly causing the de
struction of their careers and families. 
Or, even if they are guilty, it will bring 
to light private information that really 
has no effect on how they do their job. 
This information is between the 
people involved in the adulterous relationship and their spouses. They are 
wrong to have an affair, but its just as 
wrong to expose this for the sake of 
personal gain.
Larry Flynt is just pouring gas on 
an open flame. Why settle for one 
destructive sex scandal that shakes 
the country when you can have doz
ens? The general public doesnt really 
care that politicians are having extra
marital affairs, other than that it 
makes for interesting reading when 
its the headline of the New York Times 
and accompanied by pictures of some 
senator wearing a diaper and a baby 
bonnet chasing a naked hooker across 
his hotel 
room. But 
as a func
tion of how 
they are 
doing in 
their 
elected 
posts, this 
has no 
bearing at 
all. Larry 
Flynts of
fer may 
show the 
hypocrisy
of our senators and congresspeople, 
but its not worth the destruction it 
could possibly cause.
So, the question is: how do we stop 
this obsession with sex scandals in 
Washington? My solution is simple. 
Dig up dirt on Strom Thurmond hav
ing a recent affair. Scandals would 
stop overnight. Once people get the 
image of this 90-something-year-old 
man having an affair into their heads, 
no one will want to hear about 
another sex scandal again. The effect 
is double if the affair is with Janet 
Reno. I know I have nightmares just 
thinking about it. And finally our gov
ernment might be able to get back to 
the true business of government  
selling power and influence to major 
corporations.

Open Forum
by Rebecca Fribush
Matt Blum/Tartan Art Staff
Hustler publisher Larry Flynt, whose1 
brushes with the legal system usually re
volve around the right to publish and mar
ket pornography, has gone from the inti
mate parts of youthful models to the inti
mate lives of Republican lawmakers. Flynt 
put an ad in the 
Washington Post 
last October offeringup to amillion dollars in 
cash to anyone 
who could con
vincingly prove 
sexual misdeeds 
on the part of any 
important 
enough politi
cian. Like his 
battles on behalf 
of Hustler and 
the rest of his 
pom empire, his current congressional ad
ventures mix the admirable and the sordid.
What Flynt is doing would make any 
postmodernist proud: Hes revealing meta
hypocrisy. His goal of exposing politicians 
who sidestep the truth in order to pursue 
partisan ends is also pretty cool. Yet his 
tactics leave something to be desired. Find
ing leads by offering money to potential 
sources undercuts his journalistic credibil
ity. And, perhaps more seriously, he may be 
fueling the fires hes supposedly trying to 
snuff out. Hes exposing the private failings 
of certain politicians in order to show how 
hypocritical they are for doing the same to 
others. But, by digging into their personal 
lives, is he contributing to a hysterical atmo
sphere in which the private misdeeds of 
public figures are more relevant to their 
continuation in office than their ability to 
actually govern?
Flynts goal is not to expose politicians 
secrets for the sheer fun of it or to dredge up 
an opponents sordid past just to hurt him. 
Hes working according to serious moral 
principles with regard to who he exposes 
and who he doesnt. He couldnt care less 
what youve done in private. But if youve
done it, then covered it up, then railed against 
Clintons coverup while implying that youve 
never done the same, and especially if youre 
trying to remove Clinton from office for doing 
so, then Flynt wants the American people to 
know that youre advocating a double stan
dard. Hes said publicly that he has plausible 
leads on the misbehavior of many politicians. 
Yet he has no intention of publicizing the 
allegations against those who arent actively 
gunning for Clintons removal from office 
according to a morality that they 
themselves dont follow. Flynts also hired a 
detective agency to rigorously check his 
leads and ensure that all charges can be 
verified. So hes not going to cast suspicions 
on anyone because of something that they 
might have done.
What he already has discovered includes 
some pretty interesting stuff. For example, 
Republican Representative Bob Barr of Geor
gia, one of 13 House managers charged 
with steering along Clintons Senate trial, 
has been letting loose hours and hours of 
rhetoric condemning Clintons behavior. How
ever, he apparently was selective about the 
truth when he found himself facing trial. 
During the proceedings for divorce from his 
second wife, he said under oath that he strictly 
opposed an abortion his wife had, yet she 
testified that he left the decision completely 
up to her. Compounding this evidence of 
possible perjury is the fact that Barrs public 
views are very strongly anti-abortion. And 
even more to the point, Barrs second wife 
maintains that Ban- had started an affair 
with the woman who would be his 
third wife before the divorce proceedings had 
begun. During his trial, he was asked direct 
questions about this relationship, all of which 
he, as a good, truth-telling American, de
clined to answer. Which might be marginally 
better than relying on carefully phrased an
swers which rest on the distinctions between 
various forms of intimate activity, but 
certainly not much.
Compared to Barr, or to Clinton himself, or 
to almost anyone else in the case for that 
matter, Flynt looks better and better. Hes 
honest, committed to his ideal of justice, and 
willing to put his money where his 
mouth is. But when youre reduced to looking 
to Larry Flynt for moral inspiration, that 
says something in itself.

AIDS, from page 4
in the planets most affluent na
tion, the United States, are in
fected, with more than 33 million 
suffering worldwide. Last year, 
nearly 6 million people contracted 
HIV. In Third World countries, 
inadequate health facilities 
and lack of awareness have 
pushed the spread of HIV to near
epidemic levels.
Some would argue that AIDS is 
only a gay disease, and 
furthermore, is spread by im
moral acts like sodomy and 
sexual infidelity. They say that 
people have a choice in whether 
or not they wish to engage in 
such licentious behaviors; there
fore those who contract the dis
ease can hardly be pitied and are 
not as worthy of research 
funding as, say, cancer victims. 
This is simply not true. Unbe
knownst to many, the AIDS epi
demic is decimating the 
vampire population.
The virulence of a virus varies 
directly with its number of trans
mission vectors, and inversely 
with the speed at which it kills its 
host. In the case of HIV, the num
ber of transmission vectors is low, 
since it is only spread through 
sexual contact, open wounds, 
and theexchange of other patho
gen-carrying bodily fluids. How
ever, since HIV carriers may carry 
the virus for as long 10 years 
before symptoms manifest them
selves, much less kill the host, 
the carrier has an exceptionally 
long time of relative health 
(compared to, say, the common 
cold, which takes only a few days) 
during which to spread the dis
ease. Despite this, many do not 
realize the additional transmis
sion vectors posed by vampiric 
exposure to HIV.
Even by the likely overestima
tion of their detractors, the aver
age homosexual has between 20 
and 106 sexual partners a year, 
(statistics from www.godhatesfags.com/fagfacts.html) In con
trast, vampires must drain a huUnbeknownst to many, the

man of his or her blood every 5 to 
10 days (statistics from 
www.white-wolf.com/ 
v3D Quickstarthtml/htmll 
v3qs_p20.html). This works out 
to 36 to 72 exposures per year. 
While this is not quite as high as 
the astronomical upper limit in 
our gay statistic, remember that
vampires live essentially immor
tal lives. Consequently, they are 
driven by the necessities of their 
very nature to constantly risk 
infection. Furthermore, each 
vampire progeny automatically 
contracts HIV. This results in a 
massively exponential 
spread of HIV 
among the 
vampire 
population. 
And if the 
lblood is not 
fully drained 
from a human, that person con
tracts HIV, and if the person later 
recovers, he or she becomes a 
possible vector for the spread of 
the disease. Note that all of this is 
not due. to vampires somehow 
choosing an immoral lifestyle 
they are forced to do so in order 
to survive.
The virus has already reached 
epidemic levels in some areas of 
the world, and the continuing 
increase in worldwide travel can 
only increase the spread of HIV. 
Because prevention will only slow 
the spread of the disease, we must 
do all we can to support research 
to find a cure for AIDS while we 
still have time.
So, while you may not be will
ing to help support research that 
might save the sensitive gay guy 
next door that all your girlfriends 
run to when theyre mad at you, 
think about the creepy guy who 
runs the goth bookstore down the 
street. You may not know any 
vampires, but maybe he has a 
vampire cousin suffering from 
AIDS who will die without a cure.
Yishan Wong finds that most 
people just dont take 
him seriously.

ing streak of his own, first tallying on a 
drive to the basket and making the sub
sequent foul shot for a 3-point play, and 
then picking up a loose ball in the CMU 
defensive end and scoring on the fast 
break. The score was 65-62 CMU with 
less than three minutes to play.
The Tomcats countered with a basket 
and two foul points before taking a time
out with 1:17 left and a one-point lead, 
66-65. The Tartan defense held strong, 
though, and forced a turnover with 58 
seconds left. Deabrunzzo, McNutt, and 
first-year guard Ryan Willumson each 
had a shot at the go-ahead points but 
could not get them to fall. The ball popped 
loose and Thiel recovered.
The Tartans were forced to foul, and 
Thiel extended their lead to 67-65 by 
making one of two foul shots. Praesel 
took the inbound pass off the foul shot, 
marched the team down the court, and 
took a time-out with 26 seconds to play.
The Tomcat defense held strong, how
ever, and CMU was not able to get a shot 
off before Thiel recovered possession.
Praesel quickly fouled again to stop
the clock with seven seconds left. Unfortu
nately, the Tomcat guard made both foul shots 
and time ran out on the Tartan rally. The 
young CMU team fell to its third straight loss, 
69-65.
The Tartans were in action again last Sunday 
as they looked to snap out of their losing streak 
against UAA opponent Johns Hopkins.
The team slipped behind early for the sec
ond straight game. Noone was getting 
open, as illustrated by their 6-19 shooting 
rate in the first half. In contrast, Johns Hopkins 
shot 60 percent from the floor. The Tartans 
went to the locker room at the half in a 
37-20 hole.
The brightest part of the game came with 13 
minutes left and the Tartans trailing 44-24. 
McNutt, sophomore David Burns, and firstyear Ryan Willumson sparked an 8-0 run.
The game went back and forth after that, but 
the score was never close. With two minutes 
left, both teams had their respective starters 
out and the outcome was not in question. It 
ended with a 67-45 Tartan loss.
The Carnegie Mellon team will attempt to 
snap out of their four-game loosing streak on 
Tuesday evening against LaRoche College at 
7:30 pm in Skibo Gym.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  18 January 19999Week ends with pair of wins, loss
By ELLEN BELDNER
Tartan Contributing Editor
With wins against Grove City and Thiel now 
under their belts, the Carnegie Mellon womens 
basketball team stands 6-7 halfway through the 
season. The team defeated Grove City last Tuesday 
61-53, and scored a 62-44 win in Thursdays game 
against Thiel.
Im extremely happy with the way the team 
played, said head coach Gerri Seidl. [The team 
members] all played well; theyre starting to execute 
moves very well. Theyre reading the defense, find
ing openings, and anticipating.
Thiel committed 11 fouls in Thursdays game, 
nine of them in the second period. Junior center 
Kara Coval and junior point guard Lacey 
Perretta shot many of the free throws for 
Carnegie Mellon.
Its really not unusual for Thiel to have had so 
many fouls, said Seidl. In fact, we expected that 
sort of play from them. Theyre a scrappy sort of 
team; theyre pretty aggressive.
Most of CMLPs lead was built in the second period. 
The period began with the score 29-26, but the tally 
steadily climbed with field goals by Coval, sopho
more point guard Lauren Petruzzi, and junior for
ward Amy Novak.
Im extremely happy with 
the way the team played.  
A head coach Gerri Seidl
CMUs defense played well, stealing the ball from 
Thiel and sending it down the court into the offen
sive zone. With 5:10 left in the game, Novak stole the 
ball from the Thiel players in their offensive zone, 
ran it down the court, and scored a 2-point shot to 
take the score to 52-38, CMU.
:[Novak] did that very well, said Seidl. She had 
what we call a spark off the bench; shes really 
developing her skills. She played well. Betsy [Bialon, 
forward/guard] also came off the bench with a spark 
and really played well, as did [junior point guard] 
Lacey Perretta. We saw some sparks and really 
good overall play.
The Tartans next challenge was UAA opponent 
Johns Hopkins, who came into the game with

a 10-3 record. The Carnegie Mellon women had 
their hands full against the bigger Hopkins 
squad. Neither team was able to establish domi
nance early, and defense became the name of 
the game.

* Denotes UAA game
The Carnegie Mellon women were only able to 
manage a .204 field goal percentage, which 
would have been something to hang their heads 
at were it not for Hopkins 6-32, .188 field goal 
statistics. The Tartan defensive attack was led 
by junior Samantha Majernick, who had four 
blocks on the game, and Coval, who was the 
Tartans only double-digit rebounder with 10. 
Clearly, the tone was set for a tight, low scoring 
affair and the half ended with 19-15 John 
Hopkins lead.
The second half saw more of the same tough, 
evenly matched action. Coval led the team with 
10 points, followed by Majernick, who had eight. 
Overall, the Tartans improved their offense in 
the second period, shooting 9-27. It was not 
enough, however, and the game ended in a 49- 
39 Hopkins win.
The womens record now stands at 6-8,1-3 in 
the UAA. They will tip off against Brandeis this 
Friday in an away game and versus New York 
University this Sunday, also away. This will 
start a string of 10 UAA dates in the last 11 regular 
season games. Seidl said that the Grove City and 
Thiel wins gave the CMU team confidence for 
the upcoming games.
These two games allowed us to get in sync, she 
said. We played some new combos that we nor
mally dont get to do ... If we can be intense and 
aware on the floor, well be able to do really well.

Tartan skaters shake off rough play to win
By ERIN LUCAS
Tartan Staffwriter
Last Saturday night, Carnegie Mellon faced 
off against Washington and Jefferson College at 
Neville Ice Rink in the South Side. The defining 
characteristic of the game was intense brutal
ity, as hard checking and aggressive penalties 
made up the majority of the game. At times, it 
appeared as though players spent more time 
laying on the ice than skating on it.
Although Washington and Jefferson had little 
to offer in the area of finesse, their size permit
ted a tough physical game. Two abnormally 
large players, whose unnecessary brutality on 
the ice could only be described by some undis
closed vendetta against humanity, formed the 
backbone of Washington and Jeffersons assault. 
They hit hard and often, but their lack of skating
It was during the second period that things 
began to get really ugly. Both teams took an 
uncharacteristic amount of foolish penal
ties, including two game misconducts by 
each side. Washington and Jefferson struck 
first, as a powerful wrist shot trickled 
through the five hole of CMU goalie Jon 
Kliegman 3:26 into the period. CMU an
swered back three minutes later with 
Voulgaris second goal of the evening and 
added another tally 20 seconds after that 
from graduate student Adam Duncan.
The period was hard to watch, as brutal 
penalties, including grabbing of the face mask, 
charging, and slashing, were continuously 
handed out. The period finally ended with a 
fluke Washington and Jefferson goal. As Wash
ington and Jefferson cleared the puck 
during a CMU power play, it took an odd

skills usually landed them on the ice right next 
tc their victims.
The first period started out evenly as the 
play remained around center ice. The perhaps 
unexpected hard hitting by Washington and 
Jefferson held the Carnegie Mellon offense at 
bay for most of the period. While Washington 
and Jefferson appeared to have several good 
scoring opportunities, they also had a bad 
habit of losing control of the puck before get
ting off a shot.
Finally, 11:16 into the period, CMU graduate 
student Roger Maddalena put the puck in the 
net with an assist from fifth-year senior and 
team captain Paul Voulgaris. Just over a 
minute later, Voulgaris scored CMUs second 
goal, assisted by junior P.J. Grzywacz. 
For the remainder of the period, Carnegie 
Mellon was in control of the game, and with only 
20 seconds remaining, Grzywacz scored 
while one of the aforementioned Washington 
and Jeffer-son defensemen hauled him down 
from behind.
bounce over the CMU goaltenders stick and 
slid into the net.
Carnegie Mellon was definitely in control 
of the entire third period, as the Tartans 
outshot Washington and Jefferson 19-3. 
Despite this, Carnegie Mellon was only able 
to manage one goal. With 11:09 left to play, 
Duncan took a hard wrist shot which 
bounced off senior Steve Leondharts skate 
and into the net. The brutal play continued 
into the third period, with a total of 24 
minutes of penalty time being handed out 
to the two sides.
The game finally ended as a CMU victory 
with a final score of 6-2. The key perfor
mance in the game came from team captain 
Paul Voulgaris, with 13 shots, two goals and 
an assist. Voulgaris also had two goals called 
off because they occurred right as the whistle 
was being blown.

competitions, said head coach David 
Belowich. Weve been anticipating this 
one for a while.
With no meets scheduled from late 
November through mid-January, the 
teams left for their annual December 
training trip to Fort Lauderdale. During 
that trip, they may have longed for the 
routines of normal competition as they 
went through 20 grueling practices over 
the course of 12 consecutive days. Coach 
kicked our ass 
in Florida, and 
now were com
ing back ready 
to kick some 
ass of our own, 
junior Mike 
Robinson said.
Despite the 
hard work, the 
teams came 
back from the 
trip excited 
and deter
mined to keep 
up the inten
sity heading 
back into com
petition. Ive 
been here four 
years, and this 
years Florida 
trip was the 
best Ive had, 
senior 
Michelle 
Kondo said.
The performance in the workouts 
was exceptional.
The unfortunate recipient of the 
teams enthusiasm was Westminster 
College, an annually strong team 
which has given the Tartans problems 
in recent years. From the outset, how
ever, it was obvious that this years 
Tartans were not to be taken lightly.
The CMU women got off to a fast 
start and never looked back, winning
11 out of the meets 12 events on their 
way to a 115-90 victory. The progress 
the womens team has made over the 
past two years is remarkable, Belowich 
said. They believe in what they can do 
and have very good chemistry.
The mens results were equally im
pressive. Though not equaling the 
womens number offirst-place finishes, 
the CMU men placed second and third 
numerous times to earn a 119-84 win.
The men really showed that their 
talent is their depth, Belowich said. 
Im really pleased with how we per
formed today.
Overshadowed by the dominant 
team performances were some very 
strong individual showings. Sopho
more Melissa Schmelzer turned in a 
season-best 5:21.80 to win the 500- 
yard freestyle, as well as helping the 
400-yard medley relay to a first-place 
finish in 4:10.09. For the men, sopho
more George Heidinger had an out
standing meet, winning both the 50- 
yard freestyle in 22.50 and the 100- 
yard butterfly in a personal-best 52.31.
With the second half of the season off to 
a successful start, thoughts have begun to 
turn to the upcoming UAA champion
ships a mere five weeks away, and expec
tations for this years finals are riding 
high. I think were going to do really 
well, junior Erin Rockwell said. Every
one who scored in last years meet is back, 
plus we have some new additions that 
bode well for us.
Kondo set out a more tangible goal. 
The women could be in the top three at 
the UAAs, she said.
On the mens side, expectations are
just as high. We should really make 
an impact in the UAA this year, and 
we have a chance at winning it, 
Robinson said.
Overall, a feeling of excitement has 
taken over the teams heading into 
the twilight of another season. The 
season isnt winding down, its wind
ing up. Our most important meets of 
the season are still ahead of us, 
Schmelzer said.
The womens record improved to 5

7 and 1.

CMU celebrates civil rights
Festivities open with 
tribute from faculty
Grace and This Little LightBy CYNTHIA KOS
Tartan Staffwriter
Our goal is for everyone 
gathered today to be touched by 
something you see or hear, in 
such a way that it helps you feel 
differently about the vision of 
Dr. Martin Luther King, said 
Miriam Whitworth-Brown, 
director of annual giving and 
master of ceremonies for the 
musical tribute to Dr. Martin 
Luther King held Friday in 
McConomy Auditorium.
Last Friday, faculty and staff, 
including President Jared 
Cohon and Michael Murphy, 
dean of student affairs, attended Reflections and Musical 
Tribute to Dr. King. The event 
was sponsored by the Black 
Faculty and Staff Association 
(BFASA) to remember Kings 
life and legacy. Few students 
were in attendance, but 
Whitworth-Brown felt that it 
was not necessarily due to lack 
[of interest. Sometimes its a 
matter of urgency versus 
importance. I think the weather 
had a lot to do with the low stu
dent attendance, WhitworthBrown said.
Following Whitworth-Browns 
welcome, the BFASA chorus, 
directed by Thom Douglas of the 
School of Drama, encouraged all 
attending to stand and join in 
the singing of Lift evYy voice 
James Weldon Johnson. 
Interspersed throughout the 
tribute were additional choral 
Performances of Amazing
of Mine.
Sylvia Berry of the Computer 
Science Department presented 
a timeline of the events leading 
up to and including the civil 
rights movement, and also high
lighted many of Kings historic 
achievements. She explained 
that the events of the timeline 
reflected and meditated on the 
struggle that, despite many tri
umphs, has not ended yet.
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. 
was a visionary and an advoca
tor.... He made things happen, 
said Sandra Nevel of the Office 
of the Dean of the College of Fine 
Arts. Nevel discussed the mean
ing of Kings vision, citing quotes 
from his autobiography and 
Letters from a Birmingham 
Jail. She even mentioned her 
own dream: That someday, all 
little children will understand 
what King was all about.
After a reflection on the civil 
rights movement and Kings 
most lauded contributions, 
Cohon cited the ongoing strug
gles for integration in our soci
ety, as well as indicated how he 
plans to deal with them locally 
at Carnegie Mellon through a 
strategic planning effort which 
the University has set up. He 
views the diversity of the 
University as one of his highest 
priorities, and believes 
that it is the role of the 
President to articulate a case 
for diversity within the 
campus population.

I say to you today, my friends, that in spite of the difficulties and frustrations of the moment, I still have a dream  It is a dream deeply root

truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal  I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves 
and the sons of former slaveowners will be able to sit down together at a table of brotherhood  I have a dream that one day even the state of
Mississippi, a desert state, sweltering with the heat of injustice and oppression, will be trans
formed into an oasis of freedom and justice  I have a dream that my four children will one 
day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the con

Students ponder goal of half day
By SETH MANDEL
Tartan Personnel Manager
After significant debate in 
the past, CMUs administra
tion has decided that the best 
way to celebrate Martin 
Luther King Day is to cancel 
classes between 12:30 pm and 
6:30 pm. This decision, how
ever, has caused a great deal 
of discussion among the stu
dent body about whether or 
not it is an appropriate way to 
commemorate Dr. Martin 
Luther King, Jr. While some 
students believe that this 
effort is to be commended, 
many others believe that it is 
simply not enough.
One of the main reasons 
why students were in favor of 
this decision was that they 
felt that having a half-day 
helped establish the impor
tance of this holiday. I think a 
half-day gives an opportunity 
to at least participate in the 
seminars and programs being 
offered, said Angela Sun, a 
junior business administra
tion major. In previous years, 
we didnt have time off and it 
was just like any other day. 
This way, we still get our du
cation but at the same time 
we can pay tribute to Martin 
Luther King.
Its good that some people 
recognize that there is some 
need for recognition of a great 
man, said Shashvat Prakash, 
a graduate student in 
mechanical engineering. 
Having this time off is a place 
to start; a time to reflect. 
Similarly, many students 
were satisfied with this com
promise because of the high 
quality of the events being
offered. I saw a few of the 
programs being offered, and 
they all look like things people 
should be involved with, said 
Savit Tewari, a graduate stu
dent in the Heinz School who 
plans on visiting senior citi
zens to celebrate the day. Ive 
been here for four years, and I 
can finally see some change. 
At least now it is not just a 
holiday, but it has some mean
ing to it.
This sense of satisfaction 
about the programs being
offered was also expressed by 
those students who were criti
cal of the decision to offer just 
a half-day, rather than a full 
day. I think the University 
was afraid of both those who 
wanted the day off and those 
who didnt. So, they took the 
cop-out of giving a half-day. 
Given that, I think theyre 
doing it the right way with 
service projects in the after
noon, said Stan Jones, a 
junior Humanities and Art 
major who plans on taking 
part in some of the volunteer 
projects that are being offered 
this afternoon.
Likewise, a number of peo
ple were quick to point out 
that the debate that has gone 
on for the past few years is 
about more than just cancel
ing classes. The people in 
the Student Life Office 
worked hard to get awareness 
out about serving the commu
nity. Although there has been 
much controversy in the past, 
the message that you are part 
of a community and should 
give something back is what 
is most important, said 
Yunny Yip, an industrial 
management 98 graduate 
who has worked with Student 
Life in the past to organize 
such programs.
Nevertheless, the majority 
of students believed that hav
ing a half-day of classes was 
simply unacceptable. I think 
it is disrespectful to Dr. 
Martin Luther King, Jr. that 
we only get a half-day. I think 
we should get a full day 
off to remember his efforts, 
said Erin Medlin, a sopho
more economics and informa
tion and decision systems dou
ble major.
If theyre going to give a 
half-day, they might as well 
give the whole day. I dont 
think the way theyre han
dling it is right, said Sara 
Eicher, a sophomore mechani
cal engineering major.
This view was echoed by a 
number of graduate students 
who expressed the view that 
this day will be just like any 
other day to them. I think 
theyre really doing a poor job

Days events include 
service opportunities
By REENA SINGHAL
Tartan Staffwriter
Martin Luther King does not 
just, represent one group. It is a 
day to be unified for everybody, 
[as] we can [each] relate to what 
he believed, said Maria-Jose 
Blaha-Cononico, program associ
ate for the Carnegie Mellon 
Action Project (CMAP) and chair
person of the MLK event plan
ning committee. [The planning 
committee] hoped to offer an 
array of events that has some
thing for everybody.
The theme for the day is 
Remember! Celebrate! Act! A 
Day on, Not a Day Off. According 
to Blaha-Cononico, the committee 
believes that part of Kings mes
sage was that he wanted everyone 
to reach a point where they can 
begin caring about each other, as 
opposed to caring only for my 
group. Thus, the events through
out the day to celebrate the life of 
Dr. King are aimed to focus on the 
Act part of the celebrations 
theme, in efforts to reach this 
goal. Classes have been cancelled 
between 12:30 and 6:30 pm to 
allow the campus community to 
participate in the University pro
grams, activities, and events in 
honor of King.
Students can celebrate [Kings] 
life by serving the community 
because that is what his mission 
was about  helping and uniting 
the community, said Carolina 
Garcia, Coordinator of Student 
Life and Service Learning and 
member of the MLK committee.
Students have the opportunity to 
sign up to participate in various 
service opportunities this after
noon. According to Garcia, over 
130 students had already signed 
up to serve the community in 
honor of Dr. King as of Friday. 
Such volunteer opportunities 
include playing games and 
preparing food at Miryams 
House, a home providing care and 
service to homeless women, and 
participating in a happy hour for 
senior citizens at Lemington 
Center, a long-term home for care 
and rehabilitation. Students can 
also volunteer at Childrens 
Hospital, the Food Bank, and ani
mal shelters, among other offcampus non-profit agencies and 
organizations. Interested stu
dents can still sign up on Monday 
morning to participate.
Throughout the day, a series of 
photo essays, tales of personal 
journeys, readings of Dr. Kings 
speeches, and interactive pro
grams and activities will be pre
sented in the University Center 
by various members of the com
munity. A community roundtable 
panel discussion, entitled What 
if King were Alive Today? will be 
held in the afternoon, moderated 
by Chris Moore, a local radio host 
and the host of televisions Black 
Horizons. Video presentations of 
several King documentary films 
will be played throughout the 
University Center. Books and 
other items focusing on King and 
other prominent AfricanAmerican scholars and writers

While everyone is enthusiastically 
making plans for 2000 and 2001 par
ties, no one really knows what the next 
millennium is going to bring. Will it 
bring world peace and an end to the 
designated hitter rule in baseball? Or 
will we be eating canned applesauce in 
a bunker in Wean Hall?
To sort out the varying predictions of 
the next millennium  from the opti
mistic to the apocalyptic  The Tartan 
recently spoke with Peter Stearns, dean 
of the College of Humanities and Social 
Sciences (H&SS). He has studied the 
millennium for over a decade and 
included his perspective on the subject 
in his book, Millennium III: Century 
XXI. Recently, he was featured on 
National Geographics Web site, 
www.nationalgeographic.com, which 
included an essay by him about what 
the future brings.
The Tartan: How did you originally 
become interested in studying and 
writing about the millennium?
Peter Stearns: I thought about it on 
and off for about a decade or so. I had 
. a sense by the time we got near the 
millennium, the amount of hype and 
journalistic coverage would be over
whelming, and it would be useful to 
sort out some of the main points about 
the millennium and be able to survive 
the hype.
TT: How were you selected to appear 
on this feature on the National 
Geographic Web site?
Mama mm
Brian Smlth/Tartan Special Projects Manager 
Peter Stearnss millennium essay on the National Geographic Web site is part of a 
feature which also includes writings by Muhammad Ali, Julia Child, and others.
PS: My book on the millennium had 
come out previously and one of the peo
ple on National Geographic knew about 
it. She was actually a graduate of our 
English department.
The book was originally published in 
1996 and the revised paperback edi
tion recently came out in the fall. Its 
about the millennium and the turn of 
the century. I did it because it was 
interesting to look at the millennium 
from a historical perspective and that 
there would be readers who would find 
this useful.
TT: What is your general perspective 
of the upcoming millennium?
PS: Frankly, the main thing is we 
shouldnt expect to be able to predict 
anything in the next millennium. A 
thousand years is too long to predict 
anything at all.
Mostly talk of the millennium is just 
referring to talk of the future. Can you 
predict about the millennium in the 
same way you can predict about the 
future? Yes, of course. Computers will 
become more prevalent, and there will 
be more old people.
TT: Can you explain why it isnt 
worth predicting the events that will 
occur in the next millennium?
PS: If people had been trying around
the year 1000 to predict what would 
happen in this millennium, they would 
have had no clue. They wouldve had no 
basis to predict events like industrialization, the French Revolution, and 
major population surge. There was just 
no basis to predict that stuff.
TT. Do you see any trends for higher 
education in the future?
PS: The obvious likelihood, because 
its already happening, is that more 
and more jobs will seek people from col
lege. Thats pretty much true all over 
the world.
I think a leading question for higher 
education is whether or not its going 
become unduly pragmatic because of 
higher education costs as well as an 
increasing sense that college is a way 
to get technical job training.
Will we preserve attention to creat 
a sense of intellectual expansion, 
critical sense, and an open-minded 
sense as one of the goals of higher edu
cation? I think this is a question for 
the future, and I dont know if its 
going to be answered.
TT: And finally, once and for all, 
when will the next millennium official
ly begin?
PS: It doesnt start on January 1, 
2000. It either already started, because 
Christ was probably born in 4 B.C., or 
if you use the standard Christian 
endar, it starts on January 1, 2001.
We sort of treat it like a speedometer. 
When the year 2000 comes, people get 
all excited because of the new zeroes 
coming in.
But since its all a human invention 
anyway, it doesnt really matter.

Students learn how to improve academic, personal lives
By RYAN D. SCHILLING
Tartan Contributing Editor
It is not very often that you can learn 
how to juggle and hear a talk about 
Aesops The Tortoise and the Hare in 
the same day. But thats just what 
CMU students had the opportunity to 
do yesterday at Student Lifes annual 
Winter Conference.
Attendees chose from a list of 16 
workshops that met throughout the 
afternoon. Some were more pragmatic, 
such as Dean of H&SS Peter Stearnss 
Study Skills for the Real World. 
Other workshop topics were directed 
more toward students personal lives, 
such as Maintaining Meaningful 
Relationships, which included sugges
tions about how to stay close to long
distance friends.
The day of activities began with a 
luncheon in Rangos Hall. Around 250 
students crowded around circular 
tables to eat turkey sandwiches or 
vegetarian salads and listen to the 
keynote address given by Indira Nair, 
vice-provost for education. Her
Students line up in the UC to get their Winter Conference registration materials.
Whats Loveaddress was entitled,
Got to Do with It?
Nair said that the first step toward 
being successful at CMU and later on 
in life, was to love what you are doing. 
When you find that you dont like a 
required course, then ask yourself if 
you love the major for which the course
is a requirement, she said. If you do, 
find the style of learning that 
is right for you. Nair also tied her 
speech into the conferences theme, 
Explore Endeavor Expand. She sug
gested that people need a healthy bal
ance of all three to be fully in touch 
with their lives and experiences.
Following the keynote, students left 
Rangos to attend the workshops. 
Students could choose up to four dif
ferent hour-long workshops.
I thought it was an interesting way 
to look at people, said Jennifer 
Gibson, a sophomore Humanities and 
Arts major, regarding the Tortoise 
and the Hare workshop given by 
GSIA professor Evelyn Pierce. Pierce 
likened two paths that students can 
take to the tortoise and hare of the 
fable. The tortoise, Pierce said, is like 
most students at CMU  they choose 
their major and go through it slowly 
while not trying new and varied 
things. She encouraged students in the 
workshop to try to be like the hare no" 
and again to enrich their lives.
David Dolan, a first-year student in: 
electrical and computer engineering, 
received some practical knowledge 
from the workshop, Reflecting on Your 
First Semester: What It Was, 
What It Wasnt. He said, I got a bet
ter understanding of time manage' 
ment, and it gave me a chance t 
reflect back on my experiences.

Writer warns that CDA II will result in more frustration
Beat
by Ellen Beldner 
_..............__
My favorite episode of The Simpsons 
-r is the one where a fat bear slowly 
ambles into Springfield and plops down 
L on Homers front lawn. The citizens of 
Springfield mob the courthouse, and as 
L they demand anti-bear stealth planes, 
L the ministers wife punctuates every 
, demand with annoyingly high-pitched 
squeals of Wont somebody please 
think of the children'?
L Strangely, this is the same argument 
h, that legislators are using to force the 
p, Child Online Protection Act (commonly 
L, known as CDA II) down our circuitry. 
L The act would require purveyors of
material harmful to minors to use 
some sort of age-verification method to 
ensure that the under-18 crowd cant 
get their sticky little dialups on photos 
of Pamela Anderson Lees silicone 
implants. Advocates of the act are now 
filing briefs that detail the ease of cred
it card verification and the Luhn Check 
Algorithm, claiming that with these 
tools, their act will be easy to imple
ment, and thus, constitutional.
But the problem isnt about how to 
restrict content; thats a rather trivial 
technological issue thats on the verge 
of being solved. The real conundrum, 
the one that this act poses, is trying to 
decide how to classify content as child 
friendly or hide the kids before 
theyre sucked into the maw of hell.
Obviously we cant rely on content 
providers to rate their own content and 
filter kids out appropriately, since there 
would always be many sites that dis
agree with parents on what kids should 
be shielded from, as well as a few obvi
ously bad sites that did not ID users. 
Any classification/ID system would 
have to be mandatory for all content 
providers to ensure that bad sites
were all hidden from the monitors of 
the innocent 12-year-old boys surfing 
the Net (if you believe that, you arent 
allowed to touch a computer until you 
watch Debbie Does Dallas 8,342 times 
in a row).
If we make a law saying that all sites 
which contain obscene material must 
require users to prove they 18 or 
above, then we would have to decide, 
file by file, exactly which sites, pages, 
images, and paragraphs are obscene. 
This is no easy task. The legal test for 
obscenity is a frighteningly messy 
algorithm: Material is obscene if it 
appeals to the prurient interest, if it 
violates contemporary community 
standards of decency, and if it lacks 
any serious literary, artistic, political, 
or scientific value.
Consider the global nature of the 
Internet community and the difficulty 
in saying that a given image lacks any 
serious artistic value. Next, multiply 
the effort and energy (i.e., years in 
court) spent on making one decision by 
the number of files accessible over the 
Net. This isnt what youd call an effi
cient algorithm.
Theres no way  practical or other
wise  to classify all Net sites as kidfriendly or kid-unfriendly (not to men
tion the fact that the Supreme Court 
gets up in arms any time someone tries 
to regulate speech based on the nature 
of its content). Hence, theres no reason 
to classify Net users as kids and 
adults, since it is impossible to divide 
web content into sets of things appro
priate and things inappropriate.
Since as a society we cant just cordon 
off a section of the Web for kids, our 
only choices are to enable them to have 
access to everything or let them have 
access to nothing. Which, the more 
intelligent among you might notice, is 
precisely the status quo.
If there were an easy answer to this 
problem, someone probably would have 
thought of it by now. Certainly the 
paranoid parents out there can simply 
not allow their kids to have their own 
AOL screen name and password; if they 
are bordering on psychotic, they can 
stalk the poor little bastards and zap 
them with a laser whenever they 
approach a Net connection.
But probably the best thing a parent
can do under the conditions is just let 
go. Face it: Any kid curious about porn 
is going to get their hands on it sooner 
or later, whether on the Net or from 
Uncle Joes video collection. (Even kids 
not curious about porn will do the 
same: My first encounter was the acci
dental discovery of a Penthouse at age 
nine.) And in fact, if given the choice 
between my (currently hypothetical) 
kid viewing porn live, on video/TV, as a 
1200 dpi magazine photo, or a 400x400 
pixel image displayed at 72 dpi, Id 
choose the bitmapped breasts any day.
Porns (debatable) harmfulness isnt 
a function of its availability. Its a func
tion of how well parents equip their 
kids to intelligently judge the value of 
the masses of sensory data that they 
perceive every day. And we cant claim 
to live in a free society if a cry of What 
about the children?! is enough intellec
tual justification to restrict the consen
sual, harmless activities of adults.

Cohon calls for increase in diversity
TRIBUTE, from page LI
We have got to do it if we are 
going to attract the best and 
brightest. The quality of our 
educational programs are so 
greatly influenced by the diver
sity of students and faculty 
that it would be a disservice if 
we did not induce it, said 
Cohon. Without question, 
[society has benefited more] 
from those individuals who 
have been integrated into a 
diverse educational environ
ment because they tend to give 
more back to society.
President Cohon views 
Mondays holiday program, 
which was organized by the 
strategic planning committee 
and Murphy, as an experiment 
of sorts because it is the first 
year that such a program has 
been organized. Cohon hopes
that students, in 
particular, will 
take it seriously, 
making the celebra
tion of Kings birth
day a day on, not a 
day off, which is 
this years slogan 
for the holiday 
program. They 
will only benefit 
if they attend, 
said Cohon.
We are all fully 
challenged to make 
it more effective, 
said WhitworthBrown in her clos
ing regards to 
Kings vision. It is 
now only up to 
each and every 
one of us to play 
a part.

REACTION, from page LI
of celebrating Martin Luther 
King Day, said Jennifer 
Chubinski, a student in the 
Heinz School. I think the vol
unteer experiences are a good 
idea, but it is not really a way 
for the campus to unite, which 
is the point of this day.
Other graduate students 
were not quite as concerned. I 
really hadnt thought about it. 
Ill be studying either way, said 
Alex Churchill, a graduate stu
dent in GSIA.
Comments similar to 
Churchills were actually quite 
common, with the majority of 
students who were interviewed 
expressing the feeling that they
were disappointed that a full 
day of classes was not can
celled, but admitting that they 
do not plan on pursuing any
thing special during the fourhour afternoon break. This 
apparent hypocrisy disturbed 
some of the students who plan 
on participating in the days 
scheduled programs.
Its annoying to hear people 
complain that we dont get off a 
full day and use the argument 
that Martin Luther King was 
such a great man, but arent 
doing any service, said Jones. 
If youre going to take the 
moral high ground and say we 
shouldnt have school, at least 
do something about it.
Full schedule of events
to take place of class
EVENTS, from page LI
will be available in each of the 
campus libraries.
Beginning at 4:30 pm, a 
Carnegie Mellon tradition will 
continue as the candlelight vigil 
in memory of King will begin at 
the Fence with all members of 
the campus and surrounding 
community invited to attend 
and participate. The candles 
will be lit at the Fence while 
Voices United, the Carnegie 
Mellon gospel choir, sings. Dr. 
Gloria Hill will speak in memo
ry of King and explains the 
meaning behind the passing of 
the candlelight.
Starting from the Fence, a 
procession, led by the choir, 
Hill, and University President 
Jared Cohon, will proceed, to 
r Rangos Hall in the University 
Center for a keynote address,
 student speakers, and more stu
dent performances by the 
r gospel choir.
H Leslie Mullins, a sophomore 
r mechanical engineering major, 
participated as an undergradu
ate committee member of the 
MLK planning committee. She 
helped in the selection of 
Randall Robinson, the executive 
director of TransAfrica, as 
keynote speaker for the 
evening. [Robinson] represents 
Martin Luther King to me right 
now. He is very proactive in the 
civil rights movement and very 
peaceful. Hes a good represen
tative of what the whole day is 
about, said Mullins.
On Martin Luther King Day, 
we should really evaluate how 
proactive we are in making 
changes in our nation, said 
Maurice Parent, a sophomore 
business administration major. 
Robinsons keynote speech will 
be accompanied by speeches by 
Parent and a selected graduate 
student speaker. Parent will be 
focusing his speech on the apa
thy and inactivity within 
Americas young adults.
Hopefully it will inspire peo
ple to go out and make changes 
when they see problems, 
Parent said.

Tartan Staffivriter
One of the glories of the movies is that 
virtually anything a director can dream 
up can become reality on the silver 
screen. Such is the case with the new 
film Shakespeare in Love, a romantic 
comedy based, albeit very loosely, on the 
life and work of William Shakespeare. 
The beauty of Shakespeare is that little 
is known about his life, so director John 
Madden was able to weave a tale that 
seems both fanciful and absolutely real
istic at the same time.
Title: Shakespeare in Loue 
Director: John Madden 
Company: Miramax
The premise of the movie is that young 
Shakespeare, played by Joseph Fiennes, 
is faced with an immense case of writers 
block as he tries to create his newest 
masterpiece, a play which he 
hopes to title Romeo and Ethel, the 
Pirates Daughter.
Young Will can find no inspiration for 
his work until he meets Viola, played by 
iGwyneth Paltrow. Viola desperately 
wants to become an actress, but in the 
Elizabethan England, women were not 
permitted to perform. Viola becomes 
Wills inspiration, his lover, and his stage
Romeo all at once, and the results are 
astounding. As we are often baffled by 
the beauty of Shakespeares writing, 
Shakespeare in Love does a masterful 
job of not only telling a tale of love and 
desire, but also telling a story that justi
fies and brings to life Shakespeares 
muse in a way that drenches the senses 
and melts the nerves. Written by En
glish playwright Tom Stoppard, the dia
logue of Shakespeare in Love is authen
tic, and is not forced at all.
The scenery is amazing, especially in 
the scenes that take place in the theater, 
which is as much like the Globe as we 
could ever hope for it to be. Another 
stunning scene takes place in the royal 
palace where Shakespeare has slipped 
in to a ball being held there, under the 
auspices of being Christopher Kit 
Marlowe. The palace is rich and the 
furniture and dishes look like nothing 
less than what would be expected 
of royalty.
The soundtrack is a blend of orches
tral crescendos and peaceful solos. Es
pecially impressive is the costuming, 
which seems most appropriate. Violas 
dresses are appropriate to her place in 
England as a member of the royal court, 
and Wills somewhat haphazard dress 
speaks volumes about his genius.
Fiennes and Paltrow give outstanding 
performances. Paltrows escapades into 
the theatrical world show her dexterity 
as an actress. She is capable of 
pulling off both the role of an 
aristocratic lady and that of a 
driven young male performer. 
Fiennes plays an outstanding 
love-struck artist, and brings the 
bard to life in a way that tanta
lizes the audiences love for the 
theatrical. Ben Affleck, Judy 
Dench, Colin Firth, and Geoffrey 
Rush also do an outstandingjob, 
each defining his or her role and 
playing each delicate moment to 
its finest level.
For anyone who ever fell in 
love with the web of dreams that 
William Shakespeare has cre
ated in his plays, Shakespeare in 
Love is a must-see film. Rich in 
Shakespearean language, love, 
and scandal, Shakespeare in Love 
brings to life the story of one of 
the greatest authors of all time, 
and doesnt lose any of its mas
tery in the process.
Gwyneth Paltrow plays Viola, Wills (Joseph 
Fiennes) inspiration and love interest.
Imagine a legal drama that doesnt 
end with the protagonists inevitable 
sappy-music-backed courtroom tri
umph. A film dealing with dead 
children that features no windy 
speeches about the tragedy of these 
young lives cut so short so soon. A 
John Travolta movie with no disco 
scenes whatsoever.

I Title: The Thin Red Line 
Director: Terrence Malick 
I Company: Fox 2000
A Civil Action, based on the 1995 
book by Jonathan Harr, which itself 
was based on a real-life Massachu
setts case, dares to not play to audi
ence expectations, and the result is an 
unusually compelling and thoughtprovoking film.
When we first meet him, Travoltas 
character Jan Schlictmann is a slimy 
personal-injury lawyer who speeds 
around Boston in a black Porsche and 
specializes in manipulating 
defendents into paying nice, juicy 
settlement fees without even needing 
to go to court. Winning money for 
himself and his clients is his main 
concern; justice is hardly even an af
terthought. So when he discovers that 
his partners have taken on as clients 
eight families from a working-class 
town who suspect that their childrens 
leukemia deaths resulted from a con
taminated water supply, its no won
der that he wants to drop the case. 
The only local entity in a position to 
contaminate is a small tannery which 
Schlictmann assumes cant afford a 
large enough settlement to make his 
involvement worth his while.
But, on his way home from visiting 
the town to reject the case, 
Schlictmann discovers that the tan
nery has ties to Beatrice Foods and W. 
R. Grace, two deep-pocketed corpo
rate conglomerates. Now the case 
looks much more appetizing. Next 
thing he knows, hes sinking loads of 
time and money into proving that the 
conglomerates dumped toxic chemi
cals into the water. As he gets more 
involved in the case and in the lives of 
the grieving parents, an odd thing 
happens to him: He starts to care 
about these families and wants to see 
justice served. But this movie is based
on real life, not on 
Hollywoodized expecta
tions of what should hap
pen. So instead of guar
anteeing that hell win, 
his newfound sympathy 
pretty much means that 
hes jeopardized his 
chances at a satisfactory 
outcome by compromis
ing his objectivity.
Schlictmann, who once 
maintained that the 
whole point of a lawsuit 
is to settle, is turning 
down settlement offers 
left and right on the 
grounds that they dont 
hurt the corporations 
enough and pouring all 
of his firms resources 
and then some into try
ing to win an impossible 
case in court.
Travolta is surpris
ingly believable as 
Schlictmann, yet hes 
helped by impressive 
acting all around. Espe
cially strong are Robert 
Duvall as the Harvard 
lawyer handling the case 
for Beatrice, and

EMILY LANDES
Thursday, January 21
Camille Claudel
Poor Camille. All she wants is to become a sculptor 
so that she can vent her frustration about living in 
the sexist and repressive atmosphere of late 19th 
century French society. However, since shes living 
in a sexist and repressive society, this proves to be 
impossible. So its not all that hard to understand 
that, instead of seeing the irony in her situation, she 
becomes just a bit, well, crazy. And it only gets worse 
after her lover and mentor Auguste Rodin, the 
womanizing sculptor credited with destroying the 
stereotype of the alienated and isolated artist and 
replacing it with the stereotype of the self-promot
ing and pretentious artist, leaves her for one of his 
other mistresses, even though shes pregnant. In
stead of listening to Ricki Lake by forgetting that 
zero and finding herself a hero, she goes mad and 
spends the next 40 years of her life in one of Frances 
finest madhouses. Do you see what happens when 
you dont listen to Ricki?

Antz
Woody Allen plays the voice of Z, a neurotic worker 
ant who is tired of his insignificant life of servitude 
and repetition for the sake of the community. He 
tries going to a therapistonly to be told that, guess 
what, he really is insignificant. Thinking that a 
career change is the answer, and also hoping to get 
a glimpse of Princess Bala (voice of Sharon Stone), 
he arranges to switch jobs for a day with his soldier 
friend Weaver (voice of Sylvester Stallone). During 
the film, he inadvertently becomes a war hero, runs 
off with the princess, discovers Insectopia, and ends 
up teaching the colony that each and every one of 
them is more than just a number; they are individu
als. Insignificant my arse! The difference between 
this film and the very similar Disney/Pixar project, 
A Bugs Life? My guess is that the Disney film is a 
little short on Marxist rhetoric.
At 8, 10 pm, and midnight

Ever After
The basic idea of this film can be summed up in one 
sentence: The Grimms were misogynist pigs! 
Cinderella didnt have to be a submissive little priss, 
sitting around and sobbing into the ashes waiting 
for her prince and/or her daddy to come rescue her. 
Cinderella couldve kicked butt! And, in this newest 
version of the classic tale, she does. Drew Barrymore 
plays a Cinderella who is not afraid to lie, steal, and 
even fight to stand up for herself and what she 
believes in. While I have to question the thinking 
behind having Little Ms. Bare-my-Breasts play a 
feminist, she was pretty hard-core in Poison Ivy. 
Also starring in this film are Dougray Scott as the 
not-always-charming Prince that Drew eventually 
falls for and Angelica Huston, malevolent as always, 
as one hell of a wicked stepmother.

The Third Eye Foundation
You Guys Kill Me 
Domino/Merge
Most people find jungle to be 
suited more towards dance mu
sic. Matt Elliot, otherwise known 
as the Third Eye Foundation, 
uses jungle as a projection of his 
disturbed visions.
Formerly a member of seminal 
noise-rock band Flying Saucer 
Attack, Elliot spent his first two 
albums combining fuzzy guitars 
with hyperkinetic breakbeats. 
Now the fuzz is gone, replaced by 
mostly eerie samples.
You Guys Kill Me, his third 
album, starts off with A Galaxy 
of Scars, which is deceptively 
quiet and bouncy. Later tracks 
present a more hellish side to
Elliots mind, such as Theres a 
Fight at the End of the Tunnel 
and No Dove, No Covenant, 
which combine jungle-esque beats 
with screeches, backward vocals, 
and creepy synth tones. Perhaps 
the only track that reminds one 
of the old Foundation is Im Sick 
and Tired of Being Sick and 
Tired, a work featuring ear-piercing guitar washes layered on top 
of cut-up drums. Even ambi 
ent tracks such as In Bristol 
with a Pistol take on a sinister, 
menacing tone.
Like Elliots other works, this 
one is highly recommended. How
ever, it is not for the weak of 
heart; instead, You Guys Kill Me 
is rewarding listening for the 
adventurous music fan desiring 
something different.
 ROB JEFFERSON
Ani DiFranco
Up up up up up up 
Righteous Babe Music/BMI
More blues, less anger. That 
seems to be the formula for yet 
another soulful, intricate album 
from Ani DiFranco. Up up up up 
up up is the latest in a long line of 
impressive efforts  this is her 
12th solo album. In Up, as in 
many of her other albums, she 
lays all her cards out on the table, 
with the fist-clenching honesty 
that has become her trademark. 
Where there once was rage in 
past efforts, perhaps even a touch 
of bitterness, there is now melan
choly or depression. And Ups 
songs are just as compelling in 
their frankness and wit.
DiFranco isnt angry anymore,
as indicated by Angry Anymore, 
in which she sings understand
ing to parents and friends. Shes 
tapped into a sadness, as in Juke
box, where she sings she says, 
leave me alone/tonight I just 
wanna stay home/she fills the pot 
with water/and she drops in the 
bone/she says, Ive got a darkness 
that I have to feed.
To go along with that sadness, 
DiFranco incorporates blues in 
Up. We hear banjo, electric gui
tar, and even accordion  remi
niscent of zydeco. And as always, 
there are places, as in Hat 
Shaped Hat, where DiFranco 
lets her vocal skill shine, and 
audiences are sure to sing along. 
In an ever-evolving career, 
DiFranco has added another suc
cess to the collection.
 ANNE RAYArtist delves into scientific world

Tartan Staffwriter
Adele Hendersons piece Nor
mal Male/Normal Female, cur
rently in her exhibition at the 
Hewlett Gallery, contains a car
toon of Pinocchio standing next 
to a statement which reads, No 
strings attached. However, un
like the message portrayed by 
the easily recognizable Disney 
character, Hendersons prints in 
this months show, S/Citing Sci
ence, are complex. Through col
lage and the use of various me
dia, her work forces one to look 
beyond initial impressions in or
der to discover additional back
ground images that are consis
tently science related.
It seems like science is coming 
back; more young people are in
terested, she said. [In this show] 
Ive concentrated on the internal 
workings of the body.
Henderson uses old books for 
much of her inspiration, and then 
integrates the illustrations with 
oil paint, wax, shellac, inks, and 
other substances. A lot [of my 
images] are from 16th and 17th 
century textbooks, and texts pub
lished during the Enlighten
ment, she said. Many [of the 
books] are explanations of how 
things worked. And a lot are from 
Germany during the 1930s. Most 
of the illustrations either depict 
the human anatomy or are in 
another way scientific.
InSubliminationNo. 8, a litho
graph and laser print collage, an 
arrangement of green squares on 
opaque black resembles a tunnel
that surrounds a section of a vis
age and appears to be almost 
three-dimensional. The expres
sion is alive and draws the viewer 
in. However, closer inspection re
veals that the face is broken up 
according to its muscular struc
ture, and pale lavender medical 
tools surface the page.
I like studying the things that 
youve never thought about [for 
example,] why we have evolved, 
she said. Hendersons outside 
interest in science has only in
creased since she received her 
B.F.A. from the University of Ne
braska and her M.F.A. from Ari
zona State University. She has 
had numerous solo exhibitions 
both near and far from her home 
in Buffalo, New York, and often 
deals with the idea 
of interiors.
Another one of the dozen 
pieces in the show is July 1998, 
a large map of the U.S. con
structed out of separate state 
maps from an 1895 encyclope
dia. Each state is a background 
for a black laser print of a plant. 
[The project] was an excuse to 
use those maps. There are some 
funny things on the maps, like 
Oklahoma is Indian Territory, 
said Henderson. The plants are 
from my yard, and it was interestingbecause what was revealed 
from the scanner was much dif
ferent than what I see when I 
look at my garden.
Normal Male/Normal Female

colorful prints of a hot dog and  
chocolate chip cookie, to draw|- 
ings of the brain; the males braift 
and the females brain lie in op(- 
posite directions.
Even though it has a puzzle
like quality, Normal Male/No^r 
mal Female is tied together well. 
Not only is it hung in a rectangu
lar manner, but each of the 112 
prints overlies an identical back
ground of chromosomes.
Henderson hopes to add more. 
Im hoping to make it like three 
times this size, she said. And I 
would have painted the wall  
dark color to give it the aura of & 
natural history museum. 
Despite Hendersons feeling 
that her piece is incomplete, Nor
mal Male/Normal Female, along 
with her other works in the 
Hewlett, successfully reflects her 
fascination with science, particu
larly human anatomy, and her 
unique artistic process.
to form a whole reinforces 
Hendersons scientific approach. 
She creates order out of what could 
be considered chaos. [Normal 
Male/Normal Female] is meant 
to provoke, she said. You have 
your own interpretation.
The words normal male are 
printed below every one of 
the fifty-six male subjects in
cluded in the mural. And each 
normal male has a partner, a 
normal female. The illustra
tions are framed in pairs and 
each couple either shares simi
lar content or contains an 
obvious link, making for worth
while juxtapositions.
Its meant to be a whimsical 
piece and also show the differ
ence between genders, said 
Henderson. Some [of the pairs] 
are cliches. Some are made up.

tures ranges from mere splotches

Eat right. Exercise regularly. Do more for 
the community. Write thank-you letters as 
soon as a gift has been given. Be perpetually 
pleasant. Its the same every year. When 
the ball drops at 12 am on January 1, people 
from all over toss out the old year and ring 
in the new one with lists of goals and aspira
tions, many of which would give even the 
most ambitious overachiever a difficult time.
Carnegie Mellon students are no different 
when it comes to taking advantage of the 
opportunity for a fresh start.
In addition to the classic healthand work-related resolutions, 
many CMU students came up 
with rather creative ways to make 
1999 different.
Doug Strain, a first-year computer 
science major, resolved to step on 
sidewalk cracks more often. His ex
planation? Theyre always there, 
and I just never step on them, 
he said.
I would love to improve my culi
nary, dietary, academic, and exer
cising skills, said Chris Hardouin, 
a junior electrical and computer en
gineering major, putting a unique 
spin on the customary resolutions for 
better health and more dedicated stud
ies. If possible, by cooking tofu while on a 
tread machine reading Quantum Physics 
and You
While many came up with creative ways to 
change their habits in 1999, just as many, if 
not more, opted not to make resolutions this 
year. For many, the idea of New Years reso
lutions is just another reason to get all worked 
up over a significant change only to forget 
about it a week later.
Jeffrey Anglada, a fifth-year architecture 
major, feels its senseless to reserve major 
changes for the first of the year. I would 
rather make the changes all through the 
year, and if I falter on those resolutions, I 
dont have to wait until the first of the year to 
make new ones, he said. All too often, I find 
excuses to back out of resolutions.
Amy Berger, a junior double majoring in 
creative writing and Spanish, has a negative 
opinion on the merits of New Years resolu
tions. They work for about a month, tops,
Neil Babra/Tartan Art Staff
then people forget about them, said Berger. 
You have to really think about it every day, 
and force yourself.
Cary McCormick, a first-year H&SS stu
dent, also believes that common New Years 
resolutions generally dont work. It depends
on what it is, said McCormick. If its dieting 
and exercise, then people usually dont stick 
to them.
However, there are a few who actually put 
some stock into New Years resolutions, arid 
see them as a valuable opportunity to make 
worthwhile changes in their lives.
I think theyre a good idea, said Vanessa 
Johansson, a sophomore business adminis
tration major. They give people an excuse to 
make a promise to themselves and try to kee|p 
it, she said.
Vincent Amen, a first-year economics m&- 
jor, agrees. I think [New Years resolu
tions] work. Its a good thingfor people to 
see their faults and how they can pos
sibly better themselves, said Amen.
While this may be a noble idea, 
unfortunately the vast majority of 
people fail to keep their New Years 
promises to themselves. Ada 
Montague, a first-year student in 
H&SS, said, Writing everyone back has 
been an ongoing one. Ive stuck 1)o 
it for a few months. Actually, veity 
few managed to make it past the foui*- 
month mark.
When asked if she had ever made a 
permanent resolution, Meredith Welsh, 
sophomore chemical engineering major, 
said, Permanent, as in maybe it lasted 
two months.
If New Years resolutions never seem to 
work, then why do we make them? Why 
keep promising to sweat to the oldies, eat 
more cabbage, or do homework, if the 
promise only lasts a month? Are we merely 
a culture of masochists? There is likely rio 
answer to why we torture ourselves with tile 
pursuit of perfection. However, according to 
Chris Hardouin, if New Years resolutions 
arent working out for you, Groundhogs Day 
resolutions tend to stick pretty well.

With the recent hike in postage rates, people whuse the mail have either been scrambling to their local post office to pick up one-cent 
stamps to complement their existing 32-cent stamps or to purchase brand-new 33-cent stamps. To help with the transition period, in 
addition to making more money off of stamp collectors, the United States Postal Service has released a line of new 1999 stamps. 
Included in this are stamps featuring Daffy Duck, NATO, Ayn Rand, and prostate cancer awareness. There is also a stamp set
showcasing extreme sports to bring attention to their growing popularity. However, with only four stamps in the set, mention of 
one of the world's oldest and most extreme sports was left out: ninjitsu. Ninjas are best known for their skills at stealth 
and espionage, and perhaps they will approach the postal problem in a similar manner. Imagine mail persons who 
don't need cans of mace to deal with those pesky Dobermans and disgruntled employees that 
don't turn to the comfort of a semi-automatic weapon, but to a ^ 
smoke bomb and a razor-sharp sword. With people like these, it 
wouldn't be difficult to ascend the postal worker chain and
enter management positions where they can
make a dream become reality. The ninja stamp.
