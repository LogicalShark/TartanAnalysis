Last weekend at the Trump Taj 
Mahal in Atlantic City, NJ, Presi
dent Bobby Bohemian and some 
of his friends in the administra
tion ran up a $50 million debt. 
Were hoping to cut some kind of 
deal with Trump to take care of 
this, said Bohemian.
Among those accompanying 
Bohemian were Vice President 
for Universe Invasions Pond 
Whale, Vice President for Busi
ness Despairs Caught Cheating, 
and Dean of Student Despairs 
Spike Muffy. The four adminis
trators primarily played roulette 
because that spinningthinglooks

Fred Rogers, star of the everpopular Mr. Rogers'Neighborhood 
television show, will be the next 
Carnage-Melon provost, an
nounced C-MU president Bobby 
Bohemian today.
The appointment, effectiv July 
1, marks the end of a grueling 
seven-month search for a replace
ment for Angel Foodcake, who
announced his retirement last 
year.
Im very happy to see that my 
replacement is a man with much 
experience teaching children,
said Foodcake. [Rogers] will be 
an asset to Carnage-Melon for 
years to come.
I simply went up and asked 
him, Wont you be my provost, 
said Bohemian. I just ignored 
that pile of papers that the search 
committee gave me.
Search committee chair Greater 
Morbid, EPP department head, 
said he didnt figure the reports 
did any good. We heartily ap
prove [Bohemianls choice. 
[Rogers] has proven himself to be 
worthy of the position.
When The Natrat caught up 
with Rogers, he was taping the 
next episode of his show. Im very
happy to be coming to CarnageMelon, he said. I can think of 
nothing better than to be helping 
with the education of our society. 
For next year, Rogers plans to 
spend some time learning the 
school, he said. I dont want to 
change a lot until I feel more com
fortable knowing what the stu
dents, faculty, and staff want. 
Bohemian said, I feel the rela
tionship between us will be neigh
borly.

Mens center protests 
sexist C-MU sororities
By RAGING LATEX
Natrat Groping Editor
The Camage-Melon Mens Center 
staged a protest outside the C-MU 
sorority houses Friday. About300 men, 
and several women who also support 
the movement, stood in the 80-degree 
weather to make a stand against what 
they call blatant sexism.
In what came as no big surprise, 
members of the center gathered on 
Maggie Mo St. and waved signs and 
banners that said Sexism: think about 
it. They also held up posters that 
were put up by the Beta Alpha Beta 
sorority which depicted a man work
ing on a farm. He was wearing only 
jeans and boots.
[The BAB poster] is a bad stereo
type of men, said mens center co
president Kiss Restabit. Most of us 
wear shirts most of the time!
The men's center was quick to point 
out that they were protesting more 
than just that poster, though.
Were not actually protesting 
against the sororities members, but 
against their policies of discrimina
tion against male members, said 
mens center founder and co-president 
Alley Boresus. The national sorori
ties are just like other organizations
Protesters stand outside the C-MU sororities.
 they feel that they can exclude a 
specific part of the population just 
because they want to.
The C-MU sororities, represented 
by the Panhandelic Council, said that 
they didnt understand the reason for 
the protest. I really dont feel that any 
of the sororities did anything that is 
sexist, said Callme Seams, former 
president of Panhand. Its just a stu
pid poster!
A spokesperson for BAB said that 
the poster was not meant to portray 
men in a sexist light, but simply be 
interesting to look at. We dont want
to pretend that men are lower life 
forms than women.
Current Panhand president Krispy 
Cravings said that the protest was 
something that Panhand was trying 
to ignore. They really dont know what 
theyre talking about. I dont believe 
that I should comment.
Camp Polite worked actively to bring 
the protestors coffee and donuts. 
Were out here to make sure nobody 
gets hurt, said Camp Polite Sen-sei 
Ricci. In this cold weather, these 
people need something so they dont 
get pneumonia!
The people who want to 
speak, do. Those who dont, shut 
up now.

Trump joins GSIA as dean
By HDDEME HOOTERS
Natrat Mangling Janitor
University President Bobby 
Bohemian has named Donald 
Trump the new dean of the Gradu
ate School of Industrial Accidents. 
Hes a very nice, considerate man, 
and I think he deserves the job, 
said Bohemian.
Trump has been in financial 
trouble lately, most recently at 
the Trump Taj Mahal, where some 
gamblers have been running up 
millions of dollars in debts, which 
they then cannot pay. The extra 
income will be helpful, said
Trump. Ive had some very pres
tigious people come to the Trump 
Taj Mahal in the past couple of 
weeks, responsible-looking, you 
know, the whole bit, so I loan 
them money. Next thing I know, 
its gone, and they owe me mil
lions. He shook his head. Im 
just too trusting, I guess. 
Bohemian, Vice President for 
Universe Invasions Pond Whale, 
Vice President for Business De
spairs Caught Cheating, and 
Dean of Student Despairs Spike 
Muffy, have been identified as 
four of the responsible-looking 
gamblers at the Tramp Taj Mahal
last weekend. The appointment 
has nothing, I repeat, nothing, to; 
do with the fact that we owe, 
Trump $50 million, said Bohe
mian.
Tmmp is looking forward to 
working at Carnage-Melon. I 
think theres a good chance that 
we can get gambling at private 
universities legalized in Pennsyl
vania, and Ive got some great 
ideas for the future of the Gradu
ate School of Industrial Acci
dents, said Tmmp.
Cheating said he is excited 
about the opportunity to work

J 4/21 BOOM, 4:15 pm. Andrew

Mother Nature. Abeautiful sunny 
day had broken out, and students 
were enjoying it. When they found 
Her, they took her to 155 Bonker 
Hall and issued her citations for 
contributing to anti-school feel
ing among students. The day got 
oloudy, and Nature was let go.
I 4/22 FIRE ALARM, 3:27 pm.

throat, stole his heart, and ran 
away.
4/26 MISCELLANEOUS,
10:41 am. Actually, nothing hap
pened except that Camp Polite 
got a call. The call was the wife of 
an officer wondering what time 
he would be home; however, the 
officer had already left for the 
day. The dispatcher took a mes
sage on a Post-it Note, and 
placed it on the officers desk. The 
next morning, the officer 
crumpled it up and threw it at the 
trash can, but it hit a time warp 
and landed in the year 4502 B.C., 
where it became the basis for 
modern civilization. It was a bor
ing week.
4/29 HARASSMENT, 12:30 
am. Members of The Natrat staff

later congratulated.

Carrying signs stating their dis
satisfaction toward the excessive 
coverage fraternity men receive 
for their dumb antics compared 
to sorority women, they openly 
urinated, exposed themselves, 
and vomited from overdrinking. 
The responding officers were too 
busy taking photographs to issue 
citations.

TRUMP, from page 1
made them decide to go gambling 
with C-MU money, Bohemian 
said, Well, we ran out of fund
raising ideas for the University 
Center and we had to get some 
money somehow. Besides, we 
thought it would be fun.
Said Muffy, The first few times 
we won. Thats when I was pick
ing the numbers and stuff. I was 
good at it. But then Bobby said he 
wanted to pick all the numbers, 
and we had to let him, because 
hes the president and all. We 
didnt win again for the rest of the 
night.
The funding situation for the
University Center was worse than 
anyone realized, according to 
Cheating. So heres the thing. 
We promised the University Cen
ter to the campus, and all of a 
sudden we realized that we were 
$30 million short. We needed it 
. fast, and this seemed like the best 
way to get it. Were we hasty? 
The renegade administrators 
took off after work last Friday in 
C-MTTs corporate ice cream truck. 
Arriving in Atlantic City around
2 am, Bohemian and friends 
started gambling. They had run 
up the debt by 2:30. This is a 
record, according to a Trump Taj 
Mahal spokesperson.
When asked how they felt when 
they realized they owed $50 mil
lion, Cheating said, It was pretty 
embarrassing. They werent 
happy when we told them we 
didnt have $50 million. Hell, if 
we had, we wouldnt have been 
there, you know? So security 
dragged us out of the casino and 
dumped us in the street. It wasnt 
very pleasant.
They didnt like my beard, ei
ther, said Whale.
The administration has not yet 
revealed how it plans to deal with 
this. Donaldis a reasonable man. 
We should be able to work some
thing out, said Bohemian. ~

A CHANGE IN OUR FORMAT:
WCRT is somewhat pleased to announce our shift in programming toward our faculty

and play stuff that people sing along with/remember the tune/like etc. Schlock 97 FM 
were nice enough to let us have their old slogan and some of the CDs that they dumped. 
We think appealing to our audience might bring us some listeners here on campus. 
Besides, youre paying for it.

BORE EM
Hey! Get a clue!
Okay malletheads, listen up!
Were getting tired of running 
this editorial every time our 
editorial board is too hung over 
to think of anything real to bitch 
about so this is the last time 
were going to explain this.
There are four types of pieces 
that run in this section:
EditorialsThats what this 
thing is. They reflect the opin
ions of the entire editorial board, 
or .at least those members of it 
who are big enough losers not to 
have anything better to do on 
Friday nights than come to the 
editorial meeting.
Editorials run on the left side 
of this page every week and are 
unsigned because it doesnt 
matter who wrote them. So stop 
asking us, because we wont tell 
yo (unless youre prepared to 
make us a better offer for this 
Friday night, in which case well 
squeal like stuck pigs). Every 
editorial board member believes 
firmly in every word printed in 
these columns and some have 
actually read them.
Columns  Our columns are 
written by any semiliterate stu
pid enough to commit to writing 
one on a regular basis. We take 
no responsibility for the opinions 
expressed in columns. Hell, we 
cant even understand most of 
them.
; The only things we tell our collinlnists are: 1) Have your col
umn in by Friday night at the 
absolute latest, which assures 
that we will receive the majority 
by noon Sunday; and 2) If you get 
yourself in trouble, weve never
heard of you.
 Letters to the editor These 
are one-time, book-length sub
missions by people who are usu
ally members of the university 
community or people serving 
prison sentences who have 
nothing better to do with their 
time. We run most of the letters 
we receive, giving preference to 
those which attempt to criticize 
us and do it badly. As with col
umns, we take no responsibility 
for the opinions expressed in let
ters to the editor. In fact, we 
usually disagree with the opin
ions we publish since we conve
niently misplace the letters we 
agree with and steal the ideas to 
use as our own (see Editorials 
above).
We withhold authors names 
upon request at the discretion of 
the editor-in-chief. Usually when 
authors name are withheld, it 
means they are afraid of either 
retaliation by someone men
tioned in the letter or having it 
known that they wrote for The 
Natrat. The names are never 
released unless the authors for
get to pay us protection money 
one week. (Dont read that last 
part to Stupid Senate. They think 
we get all that money from ads.)
Editorial cartoons  That 
thing at the top of this page. 
Sometimes they reflect the 
opinion of the editorialboard and 
sometimes we just get our art 
editor really stoned and let him

Natrat staff always does 
an excellent job
Editor:
I would like to compli
ment the Natrat for a 
wonderful semester of 
brilliant factual re
porting. The articles 
contained in this fine 
student publication have surpassed ev
ery definition of good journalism I had 
ever made for myself. The examples of 
The Natrat bringing the art of journal
ism to its highest form are just too nu
merous to count.
The Natrat features some of the great
est writing I have ever seen. The creativity and poetic craftsmanship I can see 
when reading the Slime and Impotence 
Report and the Stupid Senate Drivel 
cannot be ignored by any intelligent 
member of this campus community.
Similarly, the intramural news pre
sented in the Spurts section has often 
been so well written that it has brought 
a tear to my eye. There is something new 
every week in the IM News, and I, for 
one, am at a loss to explain how the fine 
Natrat Spurts staff does it.
The positions of The Natrat editorial 
board, as expressed in their editorials, 
are some of the most thought-provoking 
arguments I have ever read in my time 
on this earth. I had never even consid
ered voting in the Stupid Senate elec
tions until The Natrat pointed out that it 
would be prudent to do so. They also 
wrote a hard-hitting editorial on the need 
for smokers and non-smokers to respect 
each others rights. Other papers might 
shy away from such a forceful position, 
but The Natrat tackled it head-on.
Imagine the things I have learned from 
the Perversions section! I have never 
read a comic book, nor do I have time to 
watch television ... but Natrat Perver
sions is there to help me! Its thorough 
coverage keeps me abreast of these im
portant media.
The people who insist on attacking 
The Natrat through the Whine & Com
plain section are obviously people who 
havent the foggiest notion of what jour
nalism is. These individuals, starved to 
see their names in print, attack The 
Natrat on all sorts of trivial points so 
their names can be in the same publica
tion with these giants of the journalistic 
world. In reality, there is no body of men 
and women in this world that takes 
greater pains to assure factual accuracy.
In conclusion, I wouldlike to say, Thank 
God for The Natrat! Having this intel
lectual treat put before me week after 
week has made my college career one of 
the most memorable times of my life.

Writer admits pointless
ness, rambles aimlessly
Editor:
You know, I really 
dont have much to say 
about anything at all, 
but I thought that since 
you ran other letters 
that are pretty pointless, youd run mine.
Anyway, to cut to the chase  I cant 
say get to the point, because I really dont 
have one. One night, when a bunch of
Whine and 
Complain
friends and I were in a cluster playing 
Netreknot in Wean 5202, because we 
arent allowed to play games in there 
anymore which really sucks, if you ask 
me because whats the point of a cluster 
if you cant play games there?  we 
thought Why not write a Whine and 
Complain to The Natrat? I was sure 
that the others were joking, since were 
all computer geeks and write more code 
than we do prose (nice word, prose, even 
though I had to look it up to understand 
what my friend the writing major meant 
when she told me to use it). And they did 
eventually back out on me. But I had 
made up my mind to write something 
and couldnt back out.
Maybe if I just complain about some
thing, Ill fit in better with the rest of the 
crowd that I see in Whine and Complain 
each week  people like Deth CroMagnon, Alley Boresus, and Kiss 
Restabit and I wont be so embarrassed 
to see my name in this rag that you call 
The Natrat. Hey! My first complaint! Im 
getting better at this! Yea, thats the 
ticket!
But I dont know if I can complain 
much more because my mother told me 
to be nice, and I dont think that she 
would be very proud of me if I was mean 
to people in the Camage-Melon news
paper. Maybe this isnt such a good idea 
after all. I think Im done now. I guess I 
really didnt say much, but hey, I pay an 
Activities Fee, so you should print this 
anyway.

Alumnus reveals: Clus
ters are an alien plot
Editor:
After years of silence,
I feel that it is my duty 
to reveal the true rea
sons behind the ad
vanced state of comput
ing at C-MU. Its all an alien plot!
All those computer games arent really 
games! Were fighting wars in other uni
verses! Those ships are real! Were blow
ing up other living creatures!
Do you know why all of this is happen
ing? Because when UCC was built, the 
funds were obtained from anonymous 
sources whose only condition was that 
someday we will ask for a favor and will 
expect you to comply.
And now its time to pay up! Now the 
innocent students of C-MU are spending 
their time fighting another galaxys war 
when they should be studying and learn
ing and sleeping and having sex. I think 
Im the last male that attended C-MU that 
actually entered school with my virginity 
intact and lost it before graduation  of 
course, she was from the University of 
Puttsberg.
But I digresswhat I was really trying 
to say was: Dont play games! Go out, get 
laid, get some sleep, before the aliens 
really do take over. Or is that what I was 
trying to say? I dont know.

Overnight guests can _ 
really be a pain at times '
Editor:
We felt the need to 
air our views on the 
subject of overnight 
guests. There are two Whine and 
types of really irritt- Complain 
ing guests on this campus  suitemate or roommates signifi-, 
cant others, and the baggers that 'de-1 
scend on us every few weeks. You knwf 
sometimes they just get really irritating? !
If you have roommates or suitemates 
and are spending quality time with your 
significant other, boyfriend/girlfriend, 
slampiece, whichever term you prefer, 
have the courtesy to warn those who 
might have occasion to walk in on you, 
and spare yourself the embarrassment 
by posting some sort of sign. Two or more 
half naked people in the middle of a 
sexual act is not the most appealing 
sight in the world. And dont let him or 
her be total pig, unless its in your room 
in the suite where we dont have to deal 
with the mess. Its soooo wonderful to trip 
over your suitemates boyfriends smelly 
shoes in the middle of the night or first 
thing in the morning (not!).
If your significant other feels the need 
to bathe in your bathroom, be courteous 
enough to provide them with a towel, 
soap, shampoo, etc. and have them bathe 
at a time when others do not need to get 
into the bathroom. We know that we 
dont want complete strangers using our 
stuff.
As for baggers, why cant they sleep in 
Grey Matter? Like we want total 
strangers sleeping in our rooms  plus 
the fact that if we havent cleaned for a 
while, their parents look at us like were 
ax-murders or something!
Thank you for allowing those of us 
with delicate sensibilities to air their

Editor:
In light of all the con
struction and remodelinggoing on at CamageMelon, Id like to de
fend one of the most 
maligned structures on campusDonner 
Hell. One of the worst comments Ive heard 
is Donner Hell is a pus-filled boil on the 
face of the Camage-Melon University 
campus! This is patently not true.
Donner Hell exemplifies the purest lines 
and most ideal structure of any building 
on campus. All right, Ill admit, the tile on 
the outside of the building is a bit dingy. 
But thats only because the building has 
beenneglected, abused, and possibly egged 
on occasion.
In my architorture classes at the Uni
versity of Puttsberg, we greatly admire 
and attempt to emulate the design of 
Donner. I think C-MU architects should 
do the same.

Puking people deserve respect, not abuse
Bitch-n-moan MySon
In my term of imprisonment 
here at Camage-Melon, Ive taken 
sad note of a remarkable insensi
tivity that pervades the campus. 
No, its not racism, sexism, or any 
other -ism  all exist, but they 
dont bother me nearly as much 
as what I like to refer to as the 
Scourge of Forbes Avenue.
The insensitivity Im talking
about affects almost all of us, at 
one time or another.
It is cruel, demeaning, and 
narrow-minded. It takes indi
viduals who are at their most 
vulnerable and makes them into 
persons of public pillory.
Im talking about what we all 
dread  pukeism. Insensitivity 
to vomiting people. It makes me 
sick.
The casual pukeists are the 
worst. These people refer to indis
posed friends as Ralph, they 
laugh at poor souls indulging in a
All this anger, this hatred... its getting to me. I think Im gonna toss ...
technicolor yawn. Nothing could 
be more hysterical than an overindulgent companions need to 
power boot. These people dont 
ever realize the kind of damage 
they do.
We also have the malicious 
pukeists. These people deliber
ately set out to do emotional 
damage to victims of mal de vin.
On any given weekend night, 
there are roving bands of these 
pranksters on the Quad, taunt
ing and yelling angry rhymes, like 
All you guys are drunken sods! 
Go and pray to your porcelain 
gods!
This sort of behavior is vindic
tive and despicable.
All this anger, this hatred... its
getting to me. I think Im gonna 
toss my cookies.
Bitch-n-moan MySon a junior 
who has a birds-eye view of the 
pukers and the pukeists on the 
way home from the fraternities He 
would like to offer the following 
synonyms for the word vomit so 
that beginning observers might 
identify pukeists: Upchuck, urp, 
whoops, talk on the big white 
phone, talk to Ralph on the big 
white phone, blow chunks, pray to 
the porcelain god, and heave.
Inane columns cause arguments, bickering
Psyche Soitgoes
Ive got something to say, but you wont 
be able to figure out what Im trying to say, 
because Im going to ramble on and on and 
no one will be able to make any sense of 
what Im trying to say.
And if you do start to make sense of what 
Im trying to say, then I might just call the 
cops.
Anyway, on with my argument. I grew 
up as a poor white boy in the forests near 
Charleston, West Virginia, and that is 
why I think abortion is not a good thing.
-How many people do you know that have 
abortions and then get a car phone and 
make hand gestures with their dead babies 
while talking to their grandmothers?
Not only is it gross, but its dangerous, 
especially for pedestrians.
The next time my fartemity brothers  
I wont tell you which one, but you can 
guess  take me over to the Lesswood
Construction Zone pond and drop me in 
completely naked, which is not hazing 
because I like it when my brothers take all 
of my clothes off and then drag me halfway 
across campus to the viewing pleasure of 
all in Lesswood.
Its fun and I might get a date or two out 
of the whole process.
And I like dating. A good date for me is 
when I get a hug.
God, how I love hugs!! And kisses and all 
that other good stuff that can sometimes go 
along with hugs, especially if ... well, I 
better not talk about those other things.
I dont think my editor would approve 
and anyway, I was getting too excited. But 
I do love hugs!
Back to my original point, which even 
Ive forgotten so I guess Ill go find some 
women and try to get some quality hugging 
time in. See you next week!!
That is, if the administration is joking 
and decides not to let me graduate after all. 
Otherwise, Im outa here!
Psyche Soitgoes is graduating. Tall can 
kiss his skinny white butt.
Hairy Man
This week Im going to talk about some
thing Ive talked about many times before 
 beer. Lets consider the simple beer. 
Beer fascinates me; beer is my hobby.
I like beer. Beer is my friend.
I spend a good amount of my time getting, 
consuming, and doing other things with 
beer, like pouring it on people.
Sometimes I drink lots of beer at once, 
and I go out and break things, like other 
peoples property. Sometimes I just get 
very loud, and I avoid breaking things, 
which is good.
Sometimes I combine two hobbies, like 
bowling and beer. Then I drop things on my 
feet, like bowling balls.
Thats okay, though, because though I 
didnt hurt myself much with the bowling 
ball I did manage to break my leg playing 
sports, and then I left everything I owned 
in inconvenient places so that everybody
would know I had broken my leg and I 
couldnt go anywhere.
I like beer so much that a group of my 
friends and I drink it regularly.
We even have a neat name that has 
Greek letters in it.
Were not a fraternity, though  I dont 
approve of fraternities and I thought it 
would be really intelligent and witty to 
join a mock fraternity to demonstrate 
contempt for organized fraternities.
Our mock fraternity does lots of the 
things fraternities do, like drinking lots of 
beer and playing really loud music and 
breaking things, but we dont do the bad 
things fraternities do, like contribute to 
community causes or hold charity events. 
We just drink beer.
Beer has been my friend all along; even 
when beer got me kicked out of my dorm 
room, I felt that beer was standing by me.
I hope that you all can someday form the 
kind of close relationship I have with beer.
Hairy Man is graduating (he hopes). He 
hasnt found a job yet, so he and beer may 
soon be forced to part ways.

The Natrat Recipe of the Year 1991
Lenticchie al Prosciutto Cotto e Erbe Invernale al Natrato 
lentils with Ham and Winter Herbs 5 la Natrat
5tablespoons exva-wgin olive oil. and >ve mean virgin, 
pure, no sex, the younger the better.
1onion, naked and finely diced
2garlic cloves, in the buff and finely chopped 
2fig leaves
1small sprig fresh rosemary, (this will teach Rosemary' 
to be fresh with us) leaves chopped 
1sprig fresh sage (or at least someone halfway bright), 
leaves chopped
1/4 poundBlack Forest ham, (those people in the Black 
Forest are such hams, anyway) cut 1/4 inch thick, diced 11/2 cups lentils
34canned imported Italian tomatoes, seeded and 
chopped (alternately. 1 glass V-8 Tomato Juice)
Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste 
Salt and freshly ground pepper to put in the recipe 
3 tablespoons finely chopped Italian parsley (and it's 
about time that parsley was chopped)
Preparation of this recipe will take some time. Please go  
to the bathroom before starting. And wash your hands" . 
when you're finished. Remember, youll be handling food.
Place 3 tablespoons of the olive oil in medium sized 
saucepan. Place another 3 tablespoons in bowl on your, 
nightstand for after dinner (if you know what we mean)/
Add the onion, garlic, and herbs, and saut over low hqat , 
until the onion turns tender and translucent and the garlic 
confesses. Add the ham and saut for about 2 to 3 _  t
minutes. Spend these minutes quietly reflecting on your * 
life and past marriages.
Wash the lentils, drain them, read them a bedtime story, . 
and add to the saucepan. Toss the lentils until they are ' 
lightly coated with oil. Then, toss your cookies, not in tha 
saucepan, though. Add the tomatoes, salt and pepper to 
taste, and enough water to cover your tracks when dinner . 
guests suddenly die. Bring to a boil, then regulate the 
heat to a steady simmer. Bring your husband to a boil, , 
tell him you're having an affair with the mailman. Placti 
the lid askew on the pan and cook the lentils until they, , 
are tender but not mushy, about 20 minutes or longer * 
depending on the age of the lentils. If the lentils begin 
calling you 'Pumpkin Knees,' they're mushy and youve ' 
gone too far. There should be a small amount of liquid - -
left In the pot (sauce, you pervert). If there Is too much 
liquid, boil it off. If the lentils dry out while cooking, add 
K-Y Jelly.
Just before serving, turn off the heat, take off your 
clothes, and add the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive pii . 
and the chopped parsley. Stir and let rest, covered for 1 
to 2 minutes.

all; let shooting

sort them out
Its time to change athletics at 
Camege-Melon University. The 
reason people dont go to games 
is that theyre not treated to the 
spectacle that big-time college 
and professional athletics offer. 
But there is a solution!
The best part is that there is a 
really simple solution; just kill 
the visiting team after the 
game. Imagine the perfect 
punctuation mark on a big win 
 students, alumni, faculty, 
and staff all running around 
campus together with the head 
of the losing football coach. Hell, 
even baggers could join in! And 
you probably thought a pep 
rally was the best spirit-raiser 
invented.
Think of the homecoming 
ceremonies you could come up 
with. Heres Bill Miller, defen
sive back from our Class of 37, 
whos going to run 10,000 volts 
through the Washington Univer
sity mascot for us! Look at that 
bear fry ... how about a big hand 
for Bill!
For that matter, let the fans 
get involved; they can be in 
charge of organizing the mad 
throng that tips the visiting 
teams bus and lights it on fire. 
When the smoke finally forces 
them to evacuate the bus, the 
fans have the honor of hanging 
them from Architects Leap.
Talk about intimidation 
value! Well tell opposing teams 
that they might get out alive if 
they lose the game, which would 
naturally be a complete he.
Youll start seeing basketball 
players shooting on their own 
net under the false impression 
that they just might make it off 
campus in one piece.
For that matter, you could 
make physical torture a part of 
the on-field contest. I can 
already hear a referee saying, 
Holding on number 33. Take 
his left arm off. The only tough 
part would be getting the NCAA 
to go for it. You might think 
that the refs arent going to be 
stupid enough to call anything 
on us, but actually, many of 
them are stupid enough. Well 
just have to cross that bridge 
when we come to it.
Naturally, the argument that 
arises is What do we do when 
we go on the road? Wont other 
schools try to retaliate? The 
answer is probably yes, but 
well have the advantage of 
being prepared. The athletic 
department entourage will have 
to include a 250-man armed 
mercenary unit that goes into 
town a few days early and 
secures the area around the 
athletic complex or field. A few 
rounds of automatic weapon fire 
in the student union of any 
university should take care of 
any misguided school spirit.
Theres one final advantage to 
this plan. Ticket prices would 
skyrocket, and the athletic 
department would be rolling in 
the bucks. Id definitely fork 
over a few bucks to crack a total 
strangers skull with a baseball 
bat for the greater good of 
Carnege-Melon University  
who wouldnt?
The athletic department 
might even pull down enough 
money to renovate the gym. I 
should think a guilliotine would 
; be the first addition.

Natrat Guy Who Got Stuck Writ
ing All the Spurts This Week
Carnage-Melon President 
Bobby Bohemian returned to the 
wrestling world Thursday by an
nouncing a match against Hulk 
Hogan for the World Wrestling 
Federation title.
Few people know that Bohe
mian was a wrestler in his early 
days in academia. He used many 
names during his career but per
haps his most famous persona 
was the President of Power.
It has been one of the best-kept 
secrets of my presidency, Bohe
mian said. Its strange how people 
dont recognize me from wrestling 
now that I have lost some weight 
and some height, and have a big
ger mustache.
One of the biggest questions for 
Bohemian and many sports ana
lysts is can he make such a come
back.
Ive already started training.... 
Thats why Ive had such a low
profile this last year. Ive been 
running on the beach in bare feet 
like in Rocky III.
Bohemian is training under the 
guidance of Spike Muffy, Dean of 
Student Despairs. Hes very 
quick, said Muffy. Ive trained a 
lot of wrestlers in my day, and 
hes the best Ive ever seen. 
Hogan isnt afraid, though. He 
doesnt look that tough. Im a little 
worried about Muffy interfering 
from ringside, though, he said.
One major problem with Bohe
mian is that he has lost consider
able weight and height. I have to 
gain 50 pounds of muscle lose 50 
pounds of mustache.
The ramifications of this match 
are enormous for Camage-Melon 
students and faculty. If Bohemian 
wins the title, he might have to 
retire from the presidency to de
fend it; and who will be are new 
president?
Maybe Hogan himself will take 
the job. I always thought it would 
be really peachy keen to run a 
school, Hogan said.

Only-so-so signed to coach Puttsberg soccer

Natrat Dead Weight
Carnage-Melon soccer coach 
Nuke Only-so-so received a 16 
million dollar contract to coach 
the new Puttsberg professional 
indoor team for the next four 
years.
According to Athletic Director 
John Hardup, we were prepared 
to go to 13 million for the four 
years, but Nuke said he was re
ally sick of the bagpipes around 
here. We offered him abetter park
ing space, but it was still no deal.
Only-so-so would not comment 
on the deal, but The Natrat was 
able to get in contact with Onlyso-sos agent, John Smith. My 
client is very happy with the con
tract offer. Nukes a hard worker 
and a good teacher  hes just a 
great soccer man. Of course, hav
ing nude pictures of the teams

Russian circus troupe didnt hurt, 
either.

and for some reason, power tools 
have all been in contact with 
Smith to schedule commercial

that they would like Only-so-so to 
replace Bo Jackson as their 
spokesperson.
When asked about this, a Nike 
representative said, Soccer? 
Wait.... We got a soccer coach?
Bobby! Call Legal Affairs and sep. 
if we can find a loophole in thej 
contract!
Currently, there are no replace-; 
ments for the Carnage-Melon va-! 
cancy, and Hardup has indicated 
that a player-coach may be em-i 
ployed for a few seasons.
Ty Cobb did it for a while, s(>

way, we dont have to pay any
one.... I mean, we can wait and;

for the job. You didnt record that),

C-MU hide-and-seek 
team wins UAA title
The C-MU hide-and-seek team goes to work against Brancake University. Senior team captain Chuck 
Chowderling (behind cone) and freshman Billy McKenzie (under cone) led the way for the Natrats.
By JUICE N. ADANISH
Natrat Dead Weight
The Carnage-Melon hide-andseek Natrats won the first Uni
verse Apathetic Association title 
in team history last weekend, find
ing 7 of 9 Brancake University 
players in the final round. 
Brancake only found three 
Natrats in the championship 
game.
Ill tell you how good a job we 
did, said senior team captain 
Chuck Chowderling. We still 
havent found two of our players. 
I hope they11 read this and come 
home.
I think theyll figure it out 
though, he continued. They 
hevnt eaten for a few days, and 
finals are coming up, so theyll 
come out soon.
The final had a moment of con
troversy  Brancake began to 
search through a pile of leaves 
that a C-MU player was hiding in 
but stopped. Unfortunately, the 
referees awarded Brancake a find 
although they never uncovered 
the player.
In the first round of the tourna
ment, C-MU knocked off Enema 
University by finding all nine
players, while Enema only found 
two. The lopsided victory was 
helped out by 24 sophomore Billy 
McKenzie, who hid in a hollow 
stump for two hours. McKenzie 
earned All-UAA honors, and will 
be nominated for All-America 
honors, to be decided this week
end.
Being short has its advan
tages, said McKenzie. I was on 
the basketball team for a semes
ter, but I just didnt get the play
ing time. This sport has been much; 
better to me.
Gin Hopscotch University took' 
third place in the tournament,! 
beating Enema, 5-3, in the consoj 
lation game. Hopscotchs Dan 
Jerrus won Most Valuable Power 
for finding three Giggles and foi; 
hiding in a trash can full of old, 
fish guts. Jerrus was not pre
sented with the award until he 
took a shower.
The Natrat victory over 
Brancake put the finishing; 
touches on a 13-3 season, which; 
ranked them fifth in the national; 
polls. Unfortunately, C-MU will 
not be eligible for the NCAA play
offs because they do not have

Natrat football wins game, loses in style competition
By MILA YAR
Natrat Guy Who Got Stuck Writ
ing All the Spurts This Week
The Carnage-Melon Natrat 
football team won 60-0 against 
the World Football Leagues Or
lando Blunder Saturday night in 
exhibition play.
The Natrats dominated the 
game defensively allowing no 
yards gained. The Blunder could 
not complete a pass or make a 
handoff.
The head coach of the Orlando 
Blunder, Dumb Face, said Well, 
my philosopy on football is to play
the best you can and dress in 
pretty colors.
The Natrats were in their tradi
tional red and white while the 
Blunder was dressed in purple 
shirts and lovely neon green 
pants. The uniform was designed 
by LDezalet a French designer 
with a wonderful sense of clash.
In the style competition during 
half time however, the Blunder 
defeated the Natrats 32-12. The 
Blunder made most of its style 
points in the interpretive dance 
competition. We had practiced 
our Five Grecian Urns dance for 
the entire week. Im glad we did
well, Mimi Douglas, the captain 
of the Blunder, said.
The Blunder players hope to be 
the first football team to open its 
own school of the arts. We just 
hope we can qualify for the Hall of 
Fame by doing this, said Dou
glas.
When asked about the style 
competition during halftime, 
Natrat head coach Rocky Lackey 
said, All I do is coach football. I 
dont dance. I dont dress in neon 
green. I just coach football.
Their uniforms were different, 
said Bach Scamyack, star run
ning back for the Natrats. And I

Flashdance: lies, lies, all lies  a man outraged
JAVIESTS EYE
fv In-wlmg T.tl.wb,mov pntcwmg
I walked into Runt Library the other 
day in that let-me-go-watch-some-totallyridiculous-movie-so-I-can-compare-it-toexistentialism-in-my-column kind of 
mood. I picked Flashdance, you know, 
your standard rich-boy-meets-poor-butaeautiful-girl-who-works-in-a-steelmilland-takes-her-out-to-dinner-at-a-fancyTestaurant-and-she-wears-nothing-buta-tuxedo-bib-and-she-tums-eating-lobster-into-one-of-the-most-sexually-suggestive-acts-in-cinematic-history-type 
story. What a feeling! I noticed one thing 
about the movie, which is set in Pitts
burghit conveniently founds the Pitts
burgh Conservatory of Dance. Jennifer 
Beals, when she is supposed to be going 
into the Conservatory, actually walks 
into The Carnegie on Forbes. Now, this 
is puzzling to me for a variety of reasons.
The blatant deception of the producers 
of this movie in telling the public that 
Pittsburgh has a dance conservatory eats 
at me night and day like a nest of pacmen. Now this is not to say that I com
pare myself to those charming little yel
low dots which Mr. and Ms. Pac consume 
with such glee; even my ego is not that 
gargantuan. It is rather to assert my 
dissatisfaction with the dishonesty
Flashdance so obviously supports and 
the feelings of low self-esteem it inspires; 
I dont know about you, but the thought 
of my living in Pittsburgh for four years 
and not being aware of something as 
obvious as a dance conservatory made 
me feel like a yutz.
The makers of the movie were also 
guilty of the sin of having no sense of 
fashion. It seems to me that the people 
whose statues adorn the front of The 
Carnegie (probably some assorted 
Carnegie family members) would turn 
over in their proverbial graves if they 
ever saw anyone as poorly dressed as 
Jennifer Beals was in Flashdance enter 
those heavy copper doors. Of course, they 
would have turned back over if theyd 
seen the type of dancing she was alleg
edly doing inside, so theyd be right side
up again, and I guess it wouldnt matter 
if they were aware of Flashdance or not.
So, as we see, Flashdance stands as a 
first-class example of dishonesty, bad 
taste, and all that is ungood in our soci
ety. And this brings me to the topic of 
censorship. Censorship is the plague of 
our fine, upstanding country, the bane of 
every red-blooded American man who 
enjoys reading, as well as engaging in 
other activities which would be really 
gauche of me to mention, Playboy maga
zine, the insert-your-favorite-long-obnoxious-phrase-whose-meaning-is-equivalent-to-bad here.
And that brings me to the subject of 
MTV. I have but one thing to say to that 
horribly obnoxious man who hosts 120 
Minutes, Dave Kendall. Get a clue. And 
while youre at it, get rid of that trendy
leather jacket and buy a nice sportsjacket
 I know you have the money, since you 
produce the show, too. And get rid of that 
stupid accent. I know its real, but it 
sounds dumb. Really really dumb. (Sorry, 
guys, I couldnt think of a suitably long 
yet engaging simile to put in to let yoji 
know exactly how dumb its sounds). 
And thats all I have to say about MTV.
Which brings me back to Flashdance. 
The music is really bad. Remember the 
song Man Hunt (thats the one where 
Tina Tech writhes and squirms in fake 
patent leather with a catchers mask 
on)? Thats right, and the reason you 
dont remember it is because its so bad.
Javiest Egregiously Marxist is the al
ter-ego of Donny in New Kids on the

Pride in Little Voices: Projectionist prides his 2210 friends
1990 Tri-Star Pictures 
fclarvey the Projectionist takes pride in his work for 2210.
I.M. TIPSY
Natrat Feet Editor
This year, we have seen the 
cinematic milestones offered in 
the 2210 theater. Although many 
students take it for granted, this 
service is provided via the efforts 
and talents of one lone and dedi
cated man: Harvey the Projec
tionist.
Thats right, kids, without 
Harvey we would sit in front of an 
empty screen every weekend. 
Without Harvey we would have 
no one to play those many reels of 
movies a night at 2210. Many 
critics of the cinematic culture 
have, without ever consulting 
Harvey, taken stabs at his honed 
skills. Recently, in an exclusive 
interview, Harvey told The Natrat 
about the trials and triumphs of 
being a projectionist.
The Natrat: Harvey, how long 
have you been a projectionist?
Harvey: Well, honey, Ive been 
rolling these films since I was a 
squeak in the county prison fiftyeight years ago.
The Natrat: What inspired you 
to become a projectionist?
Harvey: Well, honey, those boys 
in there are rough. I was inno
cent, and I only had one murder 
count; the other guys had as many 
as seventeen, so I didnt fit in. So, 
it was easier for me to hide behind 
the projector than sit in the dark
ened auditorium with them. But I 
am innocent.
The Natrat: Harvey, calm down, 
youre not on trial.
Harvey: I get carried away. 
Sometimes, I get these horrible 
flashbacks. The trial was gruel
ing. I am innocent, you know.
The Natrat: Your critics talk a 
lot of your lack of speed. How do 
you respond to that?
Harvey: When they complain 
about the time between reels, they 
just show their ignorance of my 
advanced method. I like to give 
the audience time to adjust to 
whats just happened on the 
screen. Theres some pretty heavy 
stuff in todays films, like the love 
scene in Teenage Mutant Ninja 
Turtles.
The Natrat: Is there a method 
behind the garbled sound at 2210?
Harvey.Oi course, I have a 
method for everything. Thats 
what they said at my trial, that I 
was a methodical killer, that I 
was a calculating mind.
Im innocent, I have a heart, but 
my art requires precisionism, 
excatitudeness.
The Natrat: What do you do for 
that fuzzy, shakey-shakey effect?
Harvey: Look, I am a trained 
artist. That never happens. Ex
act when my friends come to visit 
me.
The Natrat: What friends?
Harvey: Oh, um, well, you cant 
see them. Theyre very special. 
You could say that theyre close to 
my heart.
The Natrat: As in, theyre in 
your head?
Harvey: Why must you persist 
in tarnishing my image? Why do 
you think I am crazy? I am a 
professional. I have special 
friends, yes. Thats all I have to 
say abut that.
The Natrat: Harvey, you must
notice the inconsistent sound, 
then.
Harvey: Huh?
The Natrat: Harvey, I think 
one aspect of your art area that 
not many people can understand 
is why you choose to run those 
movies as square when the screen 
is rectangular.
Harvey: I like to put a personal 
touch to my work. Thats my trade
mark, the square projection onto 
the rectangular screen. I think 
that that is a metaphor to my life, 
I have never fit in, I have always 
been the square peg. Thats why I 
love projectioning at 2210. I can 
put my mark on an already ac
cepted work and no one thinks 
twice. I am accepted and loved 
here at Camage-Melon. And so 
are my friends.
Wed like to thank the academy 
... [At this point, Harvey stood on 
his projectionist stool and started 
singing lyrics from Cabaret.] 
Dont stay home sitting in your 
room 
Go out and play 
Life is a cabaret.

our media-driven mass society and the 19th century conception of the individual will to power? Or not?

by Joe Blob Briggs
So the Grapevine, Texas Com
puter Emporium and Car Wash 
had a special this week where 
they take your beat-up VCR, mi
crowave, blender, Nintendo, 
Betamax (remember those?) re
mote control, or other electronic 
gadget-type device thats been 
doubling as a paperweight and 
dog-training projectile and they 
give you a brand new Crabapple 
computer for only $1.73 less than 
you would have paid without the 
trade-in.
Being a nineties kind of drivein movie critic, I figgered that it 
was about time I electronified 
myself. So I rooted around in the 
junk trunk that Scooter keeps out 
front to scare the revenue agents 
away until I found a raccoonchewed 1965 reel-to-reel tape re
corder. I brought it on down to the 
store and walked out with a 
Macintoy Luggable computer.
Actually, to say that I walked 
out is misleading. I rode out on 
the side of the forklift they used to 
hoist the Macintoy and carry it 
out to my truck. They set it down 
in the middle of the trucks flatbed, 
and the truck let out that kind of 
screech that indicates extreme 
metal fatigue or a chainsaw mur
der, if you know what I mean and 
I think you do.
Once I had the behemoth at 
home, I got some help from the 
Danforth twins  big boys, the 
Danforth twins  and loaded the 
sucker into my trusty Buick. Un
fortunately, the trunk tore off, 
and we missed the early show of 
Motorcycle Sluts OnMars. Ithink 
Ill stick to the old Remington 
manual, although it does bother 
Wanda when I type during the 
movie.
Speaking of angry women, I saw 
the future of promotional filmmaking this week, and frankly, it 
scared the daylights out of me. 
Im talking about Gender War
rior: TheBeth Cro-Magnon Story.
Deth made this movie herself, 
strapping a camera to her shoul
der as she went out on rampage. 
When she tried to pass it off as a 
powerful commentary on a sexist 
society, Carolco picked it up for 
distribution as an action flick in 
the tradition of Big Bad Mama. 
As the posters say, Shes got the

brain; shes got the cause; but she 
doesnt have the tact.
Two breasts (arent they nice? 
Dont touch!). Hair-splitting. Flag^ 
waving. Flag-burning. Deth 
strikes without warning. Boozy 
cops. Hot coffee. Damn good apple 
pie. Aardvarking, because its my 
body. Lesbian aardvarking. Fire 
in the dumpster. Poster Fu. Quad 
Fu. And, of course, DethFu. Drivein Academy Awards for Deth CroMagnon, for doing her thing, 
whatever that is.
Four stars. Joe Blob says Check 
it out.

By SPIKE PINTO
Natrat Senior Lowlife
Theres been a lot of talk about Yess 
new album, so I picked up a copy to see 
what the fuss was all about. The album 
contained a series of songs, each with 
lots of sound in them. There were also 
people saying things on the album, and if 
you listened to the words I guess they 
meant things. I also noticed that the 
songs were separated with brief periods 
of silence in which there wasnt any sound 
at all.
After a few hours of this I grew some
what weary. The album didnt seem to be 
too interesting so far as music went, so I 
popped the CD out of my discman and set 
about seeing how it would perform as a 
murder weapon.
I walked down Forbes Avenue and 
watched the speeding traffic. The cars 
were going pretty fast, I reasoned, and 
thus should be particularly vulnerable 
to obstructions of visibility. I put this to 
the test and flung the CD at the windhield of a passing Mercedes and watched 
it spin off the road with a screech of tires 
and a splintering crash. Fortunately, I 
was able to retrieve my CD before the 
police came, and I marvelled at how little 
the sleek plastic finish had suffered 
through the ordeal.
Next, I climbed on top of one of those 
really big buildings downtown. There 
were a few security guards so I heaved 
an old lady off a tenth-floor balcony to get

BAND. By Yes, No, Maybe.
their attention. When I reached the roof, 
the sunlight made me squint, and the 
wind wind rustled gaily through my hair. 
The city below was a majestic sight, with 
jumbles of buildings peppering the land
scape. The glorious blue river wore half 
a dozen bridges like huge, expensive 
necklaces, exemplifying both natures 
splendor and the majesty of mans 
achievement in one panoramic vista. I 
hurled the CD off the roof at one of the 
tiny pedestrians below.
The results were delightful. I could 
just barely hear the faint crash and howl 
of pain amongst the normal sounds of the 
bustling downtown. The little antlike 
figure I hit sort of bent at a weird angle 
and didnt move. A few other ants scur
ried towards him, which was fortunate, 
since I was able to send some of the 
observation deck furniture off the edge 
to get them as well.
I realized that I really didnt need the 
CD to enjoy this activity. The crowd 
below was turning into a throbbing, pan
icked swarm. Eager to take advantage of 
the crowd density, I scrounged about the 
roof and upper floors in search of mis
siles. Pretty soon I had a continuous 
stream of bricks, flower pots, paper clips,
Wouldn't it be nice if 
this sentence had 
something to do with

plastic garbage cans, bathroom tiles, 
postal stamp machines, electric bath-' 
room hand dryers, computer disks, and 
other objects streaming downwards in 
aerial bombardment. I was rewarded 
with a pattern of crashes and booms, like 
the chain-explosion of a pack of fire
crackers that you lit and slipped into the 
purse of your aunt with the heart condi
tion when you were young.
Presently there came some sirens and 
the thudding of helicopters. I decided it 
was time to go. I ran down the stairs and 
pretended to be all screamy and scared 
like everyone else, and even ventured a 
guess to a reporter (quite accurately) 
that the unknown assailant above 
wouldnt be resuming his attack any
time soon. The reporter made snide re
mark and I guess I got pretty upset 
because I stomped on his foot then pushed 
him in front of an onrushing police car. 
Then I went home and threw lawn darts 
at someones cat.
So anyway, I guess you could go and 
buy the new album by Yes if you like 
songs and guitars and people singing. 
But I have better things to do.See what happens when you start using CDs as weapons of destruction? Cool, huh!?!
Dont you just hate those movie theaters?
toy, this sure looks like a tense moment during Toy Soldiers, but to tell 
you the truth, I have no idea whats going on. I guess you're on your own.
By ALDEHYDE SPLEEN
Natrat Mugging Supervisor
Toy Soldiers has finally opened, 
and is playing at Showcase Cin
ema East. However, the theater 
is much too far away, really. And 
ever since Kings Court closed, 
there hasnt been a theater close 
enough to walk to. So now the 
only way you can really see a 
decent movie is to drive all the 
way out to Monroeville, and you 
have to leave early enough so that 
you wont get there late, which 
wont matter if the movie starts 
late, which it did.
So I got to the theater about ten 
minutes before the movie was 
supposed to start, and I couldnt 
believe how much time I spent in 
line for my ticket. I could have 
sworn that everyone in line ahead 
of me knew what they wanted to 
see before they got to the counter, 
but you know how the adolescent 
mind works. Teenage boys trying

to look suave and sensitive ask
ing their dates if they were sure 
they wanted to see Out for Jus
tice, and their Stepford wives, si
lent until this moment of truth, 
would give the slightest hint of 
indecision, and stand there for 
about twenty minutes reading the 
sign with the playing times. I could 
feel myself aging.
When I finally got to the counter 
and bought the ticket, I thought 
the worst part was over, but I was 
so wrong. I looked at the conces
sion counter and had a cow. The 
stand was one of those circular 
ones, where you really dont know 
where the end of the line is. The 
one in which someone usually 
walks right up to the counter and
gets served, while you wait in a 
line that winds around the counter 
about five times.
And if you think the people in 
the ticket line are indecisive, wait 
until you get to the concession 
counter! These people wait until 
they get to the front of the line to 
evaluate exactly how hungry and 
thirsty they are. Next thing you 
know, theyre taking into account 
what they had for breakfast, lunch 
and dinner, and whether they can 
actually finish that gargantuan 
bucket-size popcorn or the large 
drink. Then they try to weigh 
their options; large drink/small 
popcorn, large drink/medium pop
corn, large popcorn/small drink, 
and on and on. They try to make 
educated decisions  they ask 
about things like how muchlarger 
the large drink is than the me
dium, and how much salt is on the 
popcorn they get with the bucket.
By the time I got to the counter 
and got one of the people behind
the counter to notice me, I knew* 
more than what I wanted to eat; I 
knew the meaning of life. Unfor-^ 
tunately, the people who sat 
around me and talked during the 
entire movie didnt know it. They 
tried hard to find it, though. ;
Most of the conversation was 
about a guy in the front row des-| 
perately trying to swallow hi$ 
dates face while he kissed her; 
The general consensus from th^ 
conversations I could follow wer^ 
that he would get slapped or laic}

Life and comic books, whats the connection?
Life is meaningless. The world 
is a pile of dirt and were all yeast 
waiting to be taken apart. Cant 
^oti see the connection? This has 
everything to do with comic books. 
The paper is meat for the mind 
that starves for a glucose inter
mediate when there is nothing 
l$ft. Brain candy they call it, and 
as,the days pass and we age slowly 
I ,begin to see the eternal glow of 
tbe.dichotomy between yeast and 
comics.
Next week, Frank Miller re
leases the sequel to his critically 
^cclaimed Dark Knight Returns. 
3$is new book will be printed in a 
new super four-dimensional, 11 
x 14 format, on new lead-lined, 
hyper-gloss, triple-bound redwood 
paper. The book will also be 
printed all in white with no cap

WHO GIVES A CRAP 
ABOUT COMIC BOOKS?

be black, as will the inside and 
front cover, as Millers new book 
is being acclaimed as the first 
comic book ever to tell its tale via 
scratch and sniff. Miller calls it 
the fourth-dimension in comic 
book story telling, man.
Next month, everybody dies. 
Superman, dead. Spiderman, 
dead. Batman, dead. Theyre all 
dead! To compensate, the compa
nies will consolidate into one big 
company called Megacomics, will 
print everything in prestige for
mat and charge twenty-two dol
lars an issue  each issue is sure 
to be a collectors item.
The heroes will eventually re
turn, although everybodys minds 
will be made out of Jello, like that 
makes a difference. This return 
will kick off a 87-page maxi-se
ries with crossovers into every 
title being published, hi mom!, as 
the disoriented heroes of today 
try to find their scattered brains. 
Each and every single issue will 
guest star the Punisher and Ghost 
Rider, so be sure to check it out.
Oh, as a side note, and as a way 
to make tons of money, the new 
super conglomerate company will 
give Superman 26 additional titles 
making him the first daily comic
character ever published. Kinda 
neat huh?
Alan Moore returns to the com
ics fold as well as he publishes 
Viking George. This story of a 23- 
year-old scientist with a mutant 
beard attempts to explain the 
aforementioned yeast/ art di
chotomy. Flowing through the 
Vaughnian creature are magnetic 
yeast which make him eternally 
cursed with a living beard which 
attempts to kill and maim all 
which stand in this tragic figures 
way. Indeed it is a poignant tale 
of a mans inner conflict with fol
licles gone mad. Its really deep, 
so if you dont buy it, youre miss
ing out on some totally uplifting 
cosmic thoughts.

Some Obscure Artistic 
Foreign Flick
Sure, we could describe it to you, but you wouldnt 
go see it anyway, so it doesnt really matter. But 
those artistic types might start sending us nasty 
letters to the editor, so we should probably tell you a 
little about it.
Its all in black and white, spoken entirely in 
French, German, and some other language which 
isnt English (dont worry though, its subtitled, of 
course), and involves lots of naked women playing 
accordions around small children all dressed in white 
singing Gregorian chants. And after the movie, you 
can fight with your friends about what this silly 
movie was all about over cigarettes and coffee in the 
Yard.
Check it out, and see it twice for $1.50!

Healthy non-smoking men, 18-
37, wanted to participate in study 
of our new pharmaceutical. Were 
pretty sure of what it will do to you 
(blindness, impotence, excess 
stomach acid, early baldness), btit 
we can't get past the Food and

give them some test data. We got 
caught falsifying the numbers last

time. Look at it this way; at least 
we'll pay you.
