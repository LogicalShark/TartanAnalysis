GSA splits from Senate
Proposal passes after third attempt

As part of its $22 million Learn
ing and Intelligent Systems ini
tiative, the National Science 
Foundation (NSF) has awarded 
over $4 million to 16 Carnegie 
Mellon University researchers 
and 10 collaborators at the Uni
versity of Pittsburgh. The money 
will be used to fund new and 
existing research centers as well 
as interdisciplinary projects in
volving the study of learning.
[About a year ago,] NSF put 
out a very high profile call for 
proposals on this, and over 300 
pre-proposals were submitted 
[from around the country], said 
James McClelland, professor of 
psychology and co-director of the 
Center for the Neural Basis of 
Cognition. Subsequently, two 
competitive rounds were held in
order to select the final funded 
proposals.
Out of [around] 30 proposals 
funded nationwide, Carnegie 
Mellon University is involved 
with five of them, so it suggests 
that our university  in various 
different ways  is on the fore
front of research on learning and 
intelligence, said McClelland.
Carnegie Mellon University 
and the University of Pittsburghs 
collaborative efforts garnered 
more funding than any other 
group. While the five funded 
project proposals were not all cen
trally coordinated, they did all 
share a common theme. As Pro
fessor Tom Mitchell of the School 
of Computer Science explained, 
All of these projects are scien
tifically related because they all 
get at the same question: How 
does learning work? ... Some of 
these projects will pursue the
question by studying learning in 
humans, others by developing 
algorithms that enable comput
ers to learn.
A Center for the Study of Tu
toring will be funded as part of 
one of the winning proposals. The 
new center, which will be receiv
ing funding for five years, is the 
the result of a collaborative ini
tiative between Carnegie Mellon 
and the University of Pittsburghs 
Psychology departments.
In addition, one of the NSF 
grants will play a key role in 
kicking off our new Center for 
Automated Learning and Dis
covery (CALD), said Professor 
Tom Mitchell, the Centers Di
rector. The center is comprised 
of faculty from several disci
plines, including computer sci
ence, engineering, statistics, 
psychology,philosophy, and the

Senators vote on the GSA proposal at the Student Senate meeting last Thursday.
By MICHELLE HAN
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
After two semesters of heated debate, 
Student Senate has finally passed a 
twice-defeated proposal that will split 
student government into separate 
graduate and undergraduate govern
ing bodies. Ef- ____________________
fective next 
spring, Senate 
and the Gradu
ate Student As
sembly (GSA) 
will each work 
separately on 
issues concern
ing their re
spective con
stituencies. 
One of my concerns is that the new 
constitution is going to legalize what 
GSA is already doing ... trying to get 
more money, said Senator Kevin 
Hanrahan, a senior music major and 
Heinz student who voted against the 
proposal. I dont think its fair.
Until now, the Student Senate, con
sisting of mostly undergraduates, 
was the only recognized legislative 
body in student government. Mem
bers of GSA who felt graduates were 
under-represented worked 15 
months with undergraduate sena
tors on the proposal.
The complete process of the proposal 
has been an exemplary model of coop
eration, said Jay Shankavaram, presi
dent of GSA and graduate student in

architecture. Im really confident this 
will continue to be the case as the pro
posal is implemented.
To link the two bodies, the executive 
branch  the student body president, 
vice president, and treasurer  will 
serve as a check on the power of each.
I think the proposal was stronger 
this time, said Bryon Krug, student 
body president and ECE major who 
was part of the group that drafted the
proposal. We addressed peoples philo
sophical differences with this proposal 
by adding the executive clause that 
joins both legislative bodies. [And] 
people had more time to really digest 
the proposal.
Although the proposal involves signifi
cant structural changes to student govem___________________ ment, implemen
tation should not 
require much 
change. I dont 
think there are 
going to be dra
matic changes 
that youll see, 
said Grant 
Bromhal, GSA liaison officer and 
PhD student in 
environmental engineering.
But [there will be] greater equity and 
the chance for graduate students and 
undergraduate students to work to
gether, he added.
Another feature of the new structure 
will be the creation of a Joint Funding 
Committee (JFC), consisting of nine 
members, both graduates and under
graduates. The JFC will be in charge of

Responding to student protest that 
the University Center is inaccessible 
late at night, administrators have de
cided to activate a card reader that will 
allow students to enter the UC between
2 and 6 am.
Last year, the center was open 24 
hours a day, with a Campus Police of
ficer staffing a check-in desk from 11 
pm until 7 am. But a space usage study 
showed minimal usage at night. To cut 
costs, the late-night guard was removed 
and the building locked to outsiders 
between 2 and 6 am.

Americas storyteller 
dies from kidney failure
AUSTIN, Texas (AP)  James A. 
Michener, who guided millions of read
ers from the South Pacific to the fringes 
of space in giant, best-selling novels, 
died Thursday at his home of kidney 
failure. He was 90.
Micheners death came less than a 
week after he ordered doctors to dis
connect him from life-sustaining di
alysis treatments. Harold Evans, presi
dent of Random House, which pub
lished several of Micheners books, 
called him Americas storyteller.
Said Micheners longtime friend and 
assistant John Kings, His loss will 
be great not only to the literary scene 
but to the many colleges he has nur
tured through the years and the many 
thousands of people who feel he is 
their friend.
Micheners heralded writing career, 
which spanned 
nearly 50 years, 
began in his mid
life, with Tales of 
the South Pa
cific. The book, 
written during 
his tour of duty 
with the Navy in 
World War II, 
won the Pulitzer 
Prize in 1948 and 
was the basis for 
South Pacific, a 
long-running 
Broadway musi
cal and later a 
motion picture.
His books ar
gued for universal 
ideals: religious 
and racial toler
ance, hard work 
and self-reliance.
Im not a stylist,
Michener said of 
his writing. There 
are a whole lot of things Im not good at. 
Im not hard in dialogue; I dont have 
that wonderful crispness. I dont think 
Im good at psychology. But what I can 
do is put a good narrative together and 
hold the readers interest.

Author James Michener died Thursday 
after he stopped kidney treatment.
He never quit working, saying as 
long as the old brain keeps function
ing, I know the desire will always be 
there. I can hardly wait to get up in the 
morning, to get back to work. 
Michener was born Feb. 3,1907, in 
New York City, and was taken as an 
orphan to the Bucks County Poorhouse in Doylestown, Pa. His name, 
James Albert Michener, came from 
his adoptive Quaker parents, Edwin 
and Mabel Michener.
His childhood was spent in poverty, 
he recalled, so that accounts for my 
social attitude  Im a fiery liberal. 
Tve never felt in a position to reject 
anybody, he said in a 1972 interview. I 
could be Jewish, part Negro, probably 
not Oriental, but almost anything else. 
This has loomed large in my thoughts. 
During the Hungarian revolt in 1956, 
Michener was in 
Austria, where 
some 20,000 refu
gees crossed to the 
West. He assisted 
dozens to safety, 
writing about the 
experience in 
1957s The 
Bridge at Andau. 
By that time, 
Michener was liv
ing in Hawaii, 
where he worked 
seven years to pro
duce Hawaii. 
The novel ap
peared in 1959 as 
the Hawaiian Is
lands became the 
fiftieth state.
Former Texas 
Governer Bill 
Clements invited 
Michener to pro
file his state in 
1981, offering the 
author a staff position at the Univer
sity of Texas to help him. Two years of 
effort produced Texas, his biggest 
book at 1,096 pages.
A funeral service will be held Tues
day in Austin, Kings said.
Colleges approve 
ban on alcohol
NORTH ADAMS, Mass. (AP)  The 
state Board of Higher Education today 
unanimously approved urging an alco
hol ban on public college campuses ex
cept in designated areas or at desig
nated events. Each schools board of 
trustees now would have to approve the 
prohibition before it takes effect.
The vote was the culmination of a crack
down on alcohol abuse that followed two 
alcohol-related student deaths, one at 
the University of Massachusetts at 
Amherst and the other at the private 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
UMass last week also banned drinking 
at tailgate parties. But Thomas Aceto, 
president of the Massachusetts College of 
Liberal Arts in North Adams, said push
ing underage drinking off campus can 
cause more problems in the local commu
nities. The vote affects all 29 state colleges 
and universities in Massachusetts.
It recommends banning alcohol on pub
lic college campuses and in dormitories 
where any of the residents are under 21.
Licensed establishments such as oncampus pubs and limited events at which 
everyone was 21 or older would be al
lowed to serve alcohol. Scott Krueger, a 
freshman at the Massachusetts Insti
tute of Technology, died of alcohol poi
soning. Adam G. Prentice, a junior at 
UMass-Amherst, was killed when he 
fell through the roof of a greenhouse. His 
blood alcohol level was higher than the 
legal limit for driving in the state.
Folk singer dies 
in airplane crash
PACIFIC GROVE, Calif. (AP)John 
Denver, whose 70s hits such as Rocky 
Mountain High and Take Me Home, 
Country Roads gained him millions of 
fans worldwide, was killed when his 
experimental plane crashed into 
Monterey Bay. Hewas 53. The identity 
of the body pulled from the waters after 
Sundays crash was confirmed from fin

County Sheriff Norman Hicks said Mon
day. An autopsy was planned.

over the site about 100 yards from shore.
The plane, which he owned, was made 
of fiberglass with a single engine and two 
seats. It was considered an experimental 
aircraft, said Pacific Grove police Lieu
tenant Carl Miller. It took off from 
Monterey Airport shortly after 5 pm Sun
day, with the first reports of a crash at 
5:27 pm. Only Denver was aboard.
The plane was flying about 500 feet in 
the air when it just sort of dropped 
unexpectedly into the ocean, Miller said. 
When it hit the water, it broke into 
numerous parts.
We are all very broken up over this, 
said a family friend, Jerry McClain. The 
person John was in public was the per
son he was personally.
He scored with songs like Sunshine 
on My Shoulders, Annies Song (writ
ten for his first wife), Back Home Again, 
and Thank God Im a Country Boy. He ( 
wrote many of his hits; even'when they 
were by other songwriters, he made them 
his own. Fourteen of his albums went 
gold and eight were ranked as platinum, 
with more than a million units sold. The 
LP John Denver's Greatest Hits is still 
one of the largest selling albums in the 
history of RCA Records, with worldwide 
sales of more than 10 million copies. He 
was named Country Music Entertainer 
of the Year in 1975.
Court finds WalMart liable in fall
KALAMAZOO, Mich. (AP)  A jury 
Thursday ordered Wal-Mart to pay $3.96 
million to a heart surgeon who fell in a 
store parking lot.
Dr. Charles Butler was carrying a bulk 
package of paper towels when he tripped 
over a trailer hitch in the parking lot of a 
Sams Club in 1995, injuring his spine and 
causing his hands to tremble so uncontrol
lably that he could no longer be a surgeon.
When jurors considered lost wages, 
pain, and suffering, they came up with 
$5.28 million. But since they also de
cided that Sams Club was only 75 per
cent responsible for the accident, the 
companys share is $3.96 million.
Butlers attorney said the Sams Club 
in Portage, just outside Kalamazoo, 
aboutl35 miles west of Detroit, should 
have marked the black trailer hitch with 
a safety cone. Wal-Mart attorney Jeffrey 
Sherbow countered that the trailer, hold
ing a large commercial barbecue grill, 
was obvious. He stretched a measuring 
tape in front of the jury to emphasize that 
it was 18 feet long and 6 feet high.
We have sympathy for Dr. Butler. 
But life is unfair, Sherbow said.
Two Americans win Economics Nobel Prize for derivative research
NEW YORK (AP)Two Ameri
cans won the Nobel Prize in eco
nomics Tuesday for their work on 
derivatives, the risky investments 
that have brought riches to some 
but ruin to Britains oldest bank 
and Californias Orange County.
Professors Robert C. Merton of 
Harvard University and Myron 
S. Scholes of Stanford University 
were honored by the Royal Swed
ish Academy of Sciences for de
vising a formula for pricing de
rivatives such as stock options.
The work helped build what 
now is a $70 trillion global mar
ket. People dont recognize it, 
but their contributions helped 
make everybodys life a lot bet
ter, said Robert Brusca, chief
economist at Nikko Securities In
ternational in New York.
Derivatives are securities linked 
to, or derived from, an underlying 
asset, such as stocks, interest 
rates, or a currency. One common 
form of derivative is a stock op
tion, which gives the holder the 
right, but not the obligation, to 
buy or sell a stock at a specific 
price within a specific period.
Companies routinely use deriva
tives as a hedge against unfore
seen losses due to currency and 
interest-rate volatility. Derivatives 
make it possible, for example, to 
refinance home mortgages when 
interest rates are falling. But be
cause buyers of derivatives are not 
directly buying shares in a com
pany or another asset, determin
ing their worth had seemed more 
like gambling than investing.
Merton and Scholes formula for 
valuing the investments helped 
create a widely used standard and 
allowed for a worldwide trade in 
derivatives. The market for de
rivatives is now nearly 10 times 
the U.S. gross domestic product.
If you ask what idea in the last 
50 or 60 years coming from eco
nomic research has had the big
gest impact on the world, this is 
it, said Avainash Dixit, an eco
nomics professor at Princeton 
University. In addition to using 
options and other derivatives to 
reduce risk, speculators also trade 
them. Because they are cheaper
to buy than the underlying shares, 
there is a potential to leverage a 
relatively small amount of cash 
into a big gain. But the risk of big 
losses also rises if the bet is wrong.
The most notorious loss on the 
derivatives market was the $1.38 
billion that rogue trader Nick 
Leeson racked up on the Tokyo 
stock market in 1995. The losses 
brought down Barings, Britains 
oldest bank.
Scholes originally developed the 
theory on how to value deriva
tives while working with Fischer 
Black, who died in 1995. After the 
Black-Scholes formula on valuing 
stock options was published in 
1973, Merton helped apply the 
work to additional markets.

Carnegie Almanac
from National Weather Service bulletins and other sources
50 YEARS AGO, November 
18, 1947  The Fine Arts and 
Museum society of the Carnegie 
Institute appealed for public aid 
to continue its work for the first 
time in its 51-year history. Low 
interest rates on the original Car
negie endowment and the con
tinued rise in operating costs 
were the main causes of the cri
sis. The Fine Arts and Museum 
departments of the Carnegie In
stitute included the art galler
ies, the Museum, and all shops 
associated with them. The only 
way the Institute could raise 
money was by offering member
ships. The Institute was pre
vented in its charter from charg
ing for any services whch it per
forms for the general public.
25 YEARS AGO, October 24, 
1972Bell Telephone Company 
of Pennsylvania Security Depart
ment discovered five pay tele
phones on campus were being 
used fradulently. Each of the five 
phones had a small hole drilled in 
them directly above the coin re
turn bin. By placing a long thin 
object in the hole before the op
erator had a chance to collect the 
money, the coins would be re
turned. This method of tamper
ing with a coin device is fraud, as 
defined in the Pennsylvania Pe
nal Code 898. The total amount 
of illegal calls was approximately 
$1200 for all five of the phones. 
Most of the calls, $959.29 worth, 
were made from a phone inside 
Morewood Gardens E-Tower.
10 YEARS AGO, October 13, 
1987  President Richard M. 
Cyert left for South Korea with 
his wife on a trip that was to last 
until the next Board of Trustees 
meeting. The Cyerts were trav
eling as guests of the H. J. Heinz 
Company. Cyert was on the 
Board of Directors of the Pitts
burgh-based manufacturer of 
food products. Their plans in
cluded a visit to Inchon, South 
Korea for the Grand Opening 
Ceremony of a Seoul-Heinz, Ltd. 
plant. They were next to travel 
to Guangzhou in China via Hong 
Kong. Other activities included 
a trip to Beijing for a visit to the 
Great Wall and a state banquet 
in the Great Hall of the People.
FIVE YEARS AGO, October 
19,1992Robert Fishel, a GSIA 
masters student was found dead 
at the base of the Panther Hollow 
Bridge on October 12. He was 29. 
Pittsburgh paramedics pro
nounced Fishel dead that Mon
day upon their arrival at the 
scene. The cause of death was 
determined to be a blunt impact
to the head and chest area, ruling 
it a suicide. Memorial services 
were held among GSIA faculty 
and students on October 15. He 
was survived by a wife and child.
ONE YEAR AGO, October 21, 
1996Student Dormitory Coun
cil President Michael Sperger 
resigned citing a lack of time. 
Sperger, who was a junior En
glish major at the time, said, Re
ally the only three things I do are 
school, work, and SDC. Because I 
am trying to graduate early, I 
will be severely overloading. 
School was non-negotiable, work 
was non-negotiable, so SDC had 
to go. The former Properties 
Committee Chair Brian Bluth be
came the next SDC president and 
still is today.

In the story Researchers explore introductory classes from the September 29 issue of The Tartan, 
the CIL study comparing student performance in traditional and reformed physics courses was 
incorrectly represented as essentially inconclusive. In fact, the study showed that students in the 
reformed class performed significantly better on a retention exam than students in the traditional 
course (an average of 71 percent versus 54 percent), indicating that the reform course was more 
effective.

Graduate School of Industrial Admin

this past May, but this new NSF sup
port will be used to support [additional] 
basic research by graduate students 
and faculty on learning from mixedmedia data, said Mitchell.
The other funded projects include: A 
Next Generation Intelligent Learning 
Environment for Statistical Reasoning, 
a study of incremental learning, and an 
investigation of methods for enhancing 
literacy. These projects encompass a 
series of collaborations between the Com
puter Science, Statistics, and Psychol

Eventually, one goal of the research 
is to apply findings in the classroom 
and elsewhere by incorporating new 
teaching methodologies. An improved 
understanding of learning processes 
holds the potential for significant im
pact; it could lead to better methods for 
teaching humans, and to a new genera
tion of computer software that auto
matically improves with experience, 
observed Mitchell.
These new projects enhance or comple

the Gammage incident, and he had tried 
throughout his tenure to improve condi
tions, forinstanceby handing out aCour
tesy on the Highways manual which 
warned officers not to use racial slurs.
There are some good [police offic
ers], said Babish. [But] there seems to 
be a very hardened group [of officers] 
whose darkest days are ahead of them. 
In October 1995, Gammage was pulled 
over by Sergeant Milt Mulholland and 
four other Brentwood police officers; 
within seven minutes he had been suffo
cated to death in an apparent scuffle.
One of the officers was never tried. 
Another officer, John Votjas, was tried 
and acquitted. The case of the other 
three officers resulted in a mistrial. But 
two weeks ago, the Pennsylvania Su
preme Court ordered their case be re
tried.
Mitchell said that Brentwood police 
have made it difficult for the truth to come 
out. Portions of John Votjas personnel 
file are missing, she said, and Brentwood 
has yet to come up with the missing files.
In addition, the Brentwood police de
partment has not permitted Votjas or 
Mulhollands depositions to be taken.
The forum was sponsored in part by the 
Campus Coalition for Peace and Justice 
(CCPJ), a group started by Pitt and CMU 
students, faculty and staff two years ago 
in response to Gammages death.
CCPJ have sponsored a number of fo
rums of the Gammage case, including 
Gammages familys first appearance in a 
public forum after his death. The family 
spoke to a CMU audience last February.
That was sort of our founding event, 
said Pete Shell, CCPJ charter member 
and a computer science student at CMU. 
That was a big conference.
CCPJ were one of groups involved in 
the counter-rally against the Ku Klux 
Klan demonstration in downtown Pitts
burgh last April.
One of the founding members of CCPJ, 
CMU professor of English Dave Demarest 
handed out a history of the Gammage 
case to forum attendees last night.
It takes a hell of a lot of nerve to talk 
back against an entrenched organization 
like a police force, said Demarest of 
Babishs public denouncement of the 
Brentwood Police Force. He really gives 
you a kind of keyhole look inside the 
workings of a suburban police depart
ment.... Its really an eye opener.Crime and Incident Report
10/4 UNDERAGE DRINK
ING, 1:17 am  In response to a 
call that a false alarm had been 
pulled in Resnik, two guards 
noted five or six males walking 
toward the University Center who 
could possibly have been the ones 
who pulled the alarm. The guards 
noted that they were the same 
individuals they had seen prior 
to the alarm walking on the hoods 
and roofs of cars along Margaret 
Morrison Street. They radioed to 
Campus Police that the individu
als were entering the front of th 
UC. An officer already in the UC 
intercepted three of the males. 
They were identified as CMU stu
dents, all from a single frater
nity. The guards arrived and rec
ognized two of the three in group. 
One they had pulled off a white 
Dodge Neon, and the other they 
had pulled off a Jeep Cherokee. 
At the scene, the officers noticed 
the stench of alcohol and checked 
the three for their dates of birth. 
One of them was indeed under
age. He smelled of alcohol, had 
glassy eyes, and slurred his 
speech. He was issued a state 
citation for underage consump
tion. The three were then re
leased. The officers took the tag 
numbers from the two damaged 
cars and left notes on their hoods 
to call Campus Police the next 
morning.
10/4 CRIMINAL MISCHIEF,
9:52 am  A father of a CMU 
student, who had been visiting 
her over the weekend, went to his 
rented Dodge Neon to find a note 
left on the hood. He also noticed 
the hood and roof had dents. The 
previous night, security guards 
observed several inebriated indi
viduals walking on the cars along
Margaret Morrison Street. The 
father contacted the police and 
they responded, coming out to 
the car. The father and the officer 
were able to pop the roof back 
into place, but there remained 
two small creases on the roof. 
The dent in the hood was still 
present as well. The man did not 
have Dollar Rent-a-Cars insur
ance on the vehicle. He was to 
return the car later that day and 
get an estimate. The officer said 
it would then be up to him 
whether to pursue the matter 
through the local magistrate or 
through Student Affairs and the 
Greek Advisor.
10/6 DISORDERLY CON
DUCT, 6:04 pm  While on a 
routine bicycle patrol, an officer 
heard a loud commotion at the 
main entrance to Baker Hall. 
When he stopped to investigate, 
he saw that one of the entrance 
doors had spider-webbed glass. A 
CMU student came up to the of
ficer and stated that he had bro
ken the glass in the door. He said 
that he was exiting the building 
and the door was just starting to 
close. He said that he walked into 
the door and used his head to 
open the door. When asked, he 
said that he always uses his head 
to open doors. The officer ques
tioned his health, but the student 
said he was fine. He was issued 
an internal citation for disorderly 
conduct.
10/7 PYROTECHNICS DIS
CHARGE, 9:16 pm  A security 
guard radioed Campus Police 
saying that three people were 
setting off fireworks beside CFA. 
One of the guards chased the 
three and detained them. One of
them had no form of ID on her 
person. With her was a female 
who claimed to be a professor in 
CFA. She said that the ID-less 
girl was a student in her class. 
The professor felt it was terrible 
that CMU did not allow students 
to set off fireworks for a class. 
She also informed them of the 
reason that they ran away from 
the guards. She said they, were 
afraid of the police. They all apolo
gized for their actions. The of
ficer explained that in the future 
they should request advance per
mission from Environmental 
Health and Safety to ignite pyro
technics. The students were is
sued internal citations.
10/6 THEFT BY DECEIT,
12:30 pm  A student reported 
that his CMU ID had been sto
len. He had used his ID to check 
out a cart from the West Wing 
Post Office. But when he re
turned, he found that an un
known person had claimed own
ership of the ID, and the un
knowing attendant gave it to 
the unknown.
The next day he went to The 
HUB to have them cancel his ID. 
It was there that he learned that 
$45 had been spent at Papa Js 
over a span of four minutes. The 
University replaced the $45, but 
he was worried about what will 
happen when his account re
charges the next week.
The HUB said there was noth
ing they could do, and that as 
long as the actor has his ID that 
they will have access to his Dine 
Express account.
The student is still trying to 
find out if there is a way to invali
date his old ID card. His next step 
is to try Hospitality Services.
10/9 MEDICAL, 9:15 pm  A 
CMU student was transported to 
Presbyterian hospital for treat
ment of his left index finger. He 
had been using a chisel when he 
cut his finger. It was the same 
finger that he had sanded a couple 
of weeks earlier, but that had 
healed. A pressure dressing had 
been applied by persons in the 
shop. The oft-injured student did 
not desire to be treated by the 
CMU EMS.
10/14 MEDICAL, 10:32 pm  
An officer responded to a call from 
Henderson Hall. He found the 
patient lying supine in the hall
way. He said that a friend took 
his bottle of Aosept Ciba Vision 
disinfectant and sprayed it in his 
eyes thinking it was saline. He 
immediately irrigated his eyes 
using fountain water.
EMS continued the irrigation 
with saline. The solution con
tained 3 percent micro-filtered 
hydrogen peroxide and 0.85 per
cent sodium chloride with phos
phoric acid.
The victims eyes were very ir
ritated and red, and his chief com
plaint was that they were burn
ing. He was transported to Pres
byterian ER for treatment.
10/14 UNAUTHORIZED US
AGE, 9:40 pm  The complain
ant called Campus Police to re
port that a male had entered 
Cyert Hall A-100 through the 
printer room door and was found 
using a computer in an office re
ferred to as the Full Timers 
office. The actor was identified as 
student from Allegheny County 
Community College. The actor 
stated that he uses the comput
ers at CMU because they are the 
best. The area was checked 
around the office and nothing 
seemed missing. The computer 
was on and Netscape was run
ning. The actor said that he was 
checking his email. He was then 
escorted out of Cyert Hall and 
was last seen heading towards 
the bus stop at Forbes Avenue 
and Morewood Avenue.
10/15 DISORDERLY CON
DUCT, 7:12 pm  Campus Po
lice received several calls regard
ing a naked man at the Wean 
Hall fifth floor elevator. Three 
officers reported to the scene. 
They found the actor sitting in 
the middle of the vestibule be
tween the two sets of doors at the 
entrance to Wean Hall, clad in 
briefs and mud. Mud was cover
ing his hands, arms, legs, head, 
and neck. His legs were strad
dling a pot of water. A video cam
era was running from outside the 
window and a microphone was 
wired to the vestibule. He said 
that he was soliciting people to 
take a chance and tell him some
thing about themselves, as part 
of his performance artwork 
project. He was told to, and he 
eventually did, clean up and get 
dressed. The actor was issued an 
internal citation for disorderly 
conduct.
 Chief of Campus Police James 
LaPaglia reviews all reports prior to 
release.
 Only three people on The Tartan 
staff see the reports: the editor-inchief, the news editor, and the 
staffwriter typing the report.
 All personal names of complain
ants, victims, suspects, and fraternity 
names are omitted from the printed 
report. Ethnic descriptions and other 
personal details aie given only in the 
context of complete descriptions.
 Not every incident that occurs 
appears in the report.

GSA, from page 1
allocating funds to the various student 
organizations. In the past, the Funding 
and Recognition Committee, consist
ing almost always of only under
graduates, decided where this money 
would go. Makers of the proposal 
felt that a large portion of graduate 
student Activities Fees went towards 
funding organizations which were 
largely undergraduate. The JFC 
emphasizes representation of both 
graduate and undergraduate needs 
in the distribution of funds.
Correcting the way that graduate 
student Activities Fees were allo
cated might mean a decrease in the 
amount of money to be allocated to 
student organizations, said Krug. 
But it will be more fair.
The new proposal will complicate 
funding matters, but hopefully it will 
not significantly impact organiza
tions like WRCT which serve both 
student populations, said Neil 
Donnelly, general manager of WRCT 
and junior materials science engi
neering major.
The new changes to student gov
ernment still have to go before the 
administration, but, according to
Bromhal, Senates vote means it is 
all but passed. Bromhal said that a 
lot of the time that has been spent on 
the government structure issue can 
now be spent on issues more specific
to the student body, such as Mar
tin Luther King Day and the possi
bility of a Squirrel Hill shuttle.
For Shankavaram, it will be 
business as usual.UC, from page 1
this forum is to find out what students think 
of the operating hours of the University 
Center and to ensure that we are meeting 
the needs of the students, said Gerwig.
The idea that was overwhelmingly sup
ported by students was to have a card 
reader which allows 24 hour access to the 
UC for all faculty, staff, and students. A 
card reader had been installed at the time 
of the forum, but hadnt been activated.
In reference to the card reader, Harvey 
said, You get good access, but you also 
increase security risks.
I think we all worry about someone 
coming on campus and trying to hurt 
someone, said Elliott. Ive been here a 
long time and, although it hasnt hap
pened recently, it has happened. 
Another idea was to install a system 
that would allow late access for people in 
clubs and organizations that need it (like 
WRCT), but wouldnt allow others in.
We cant right now with the technol
ogy available turn away the casual user 
[exclusively], said Elliott.
Some suggestions offered to increase
security were using security cameras 
and increasing the presence of Campus 
Police in the buildings.
I will have a conversation with the 
dean of Student Affairs. Obviously we 
need to talk about this a few more times 
and set it up, said Elliott.
Other issues discussed at the meeting 
were the hours of Skibo Coffeehouse, 
Entropy, and of the athletic facilities. 
Starting October 20, Skibo coffeehouses 
hours will be extended to 2 am.
There was brief discussion of reducing 
the hours of the athletic facilities to 
midnight instead of the current closing 
time of 2 am, due to the lack of use at 
those times. Some students at the forum 
felt that this was because many stu
dents didnt know about the late hours.
Some students requested installation of 
equipment already present in the center, 
illustrating the need for a guide to the UC. 
Gerwig said that a guide is being made 
and should be available in approximately 
three weeks. Students also suggested that 
special hour changes be better advertised 
and more prominently displayed.

Carnegie Mellon University20 October 1997
GSAs autonomy will
cause segregation
After putting it to a vote for the 
third time, the Graduate Student 
Assemblys (GSA) proposal to sepa
rate from Student Senate has fi
nally passed. While proponents of 
the resolution hope GSAs new au
tonomy will help bring graduate 
student interests into focus, the 
amendment will actually damage 
the already weak relations be
tween graduate and undergradu
ate students on campus. This 
amendment will encourage segre
gation within the student body and 
lead to an inefficient process for 
funding student activities.
GSA, acting as a separate gov
erning body, will counteract the 
Universitys goal to maintain a 
unified and integrated student 
body. As it stands, graduate stu
dents have little contact with the 
rest of the campus; severing the 
only formal space for all students 
to interact will encourage isola
tion.
Under the new plan, activities 
and events that benefit the entire 
campus such as WRCT and Activi
ties Board productions (among oth
ers) will be allotted Activities Fees 
monies through a Joint Funding 
Committee comprised of six Sen
ate members and three GSA mem
bers. Before any budget requests 
are addressed, either Senate or 
GSAs funding and recognition 
committees must recognize the or
ganization.
Besides perpetuating an imbal
ance of power since graduate stu
dents will only put forth 65 per
cent of their fees towards these 
activities (as opposed to the 90 
percent undergraduates pay), the 
plan will increase bureaucracy
since now organizations request
ing funds will have to go through 
two or more approval processes. 
The activity funding process is 
complicated enough and splitting 
budget duties between two groups 
will make decisions harder to co
ordinate.
Supporters of the split main
tain that graduate students need 
to take an active role in a govern
ing body created for their needs. 
However, such an organization 
already exists  Student Senate. 
Graduates upset about a lack of 
programming geared toward their 
concerns should have followed the 
example of students who felt simi
larly  they chose to join Senate 
and voicer their opinions. A cer
tain number of Senate seats are 
reserved for graduate students 
and they are continually encour
aged to run to fill these positions, 
yet only one of these seats is cur
rently filled.
In addition, Student Senate needs 
graduate students at the table. It is 
an importantvenue for both gradu
ate and undergraduates to find 
common ground and act cohesively. 
Graduate students represent more 
than just teaching assistants; they 
represent an important part of the 
student body, both academically 
and socially.
As active participants within 
Student Senate, graduate stu
dents could have furthered inter
ests specific to them while con
tributing to the well-being of the 
entire student body. Instead, GSA 
autonomy will fragment student 
interests; student government 
will lose its impact as clear repre
sentative of student concerns.
Career Center needs 
improvement
Although CMU students in com
puter related majors have a high 
job placement rate, students in 
various other lauded programs  
from fine arts and history to psy
chology, architecture, and the sci
ences  are still provided with 
inadequate opportunities to find 
careers within their fields. While 
more student and department ini
tiated job fairs are becoming spe
cialized for certain fields, allowing 
students in other majors to seek 
out employment, the Career Cen
ter needs to try harder to connect 
these students with careers. But 
at the root of the problem is a lack 
of adequate facilities and publicity 
of resources.
Students should not wait until 
their senior years to look into pos
sible careers, and more impor
tantly, to prepare for the job search. 
All first-years should be encour
aged to meet with a representa
tive from the Career Center so 
that they are made aware of re
sources available to them. It is up 
to the Career Center to make them
selves known to students as soon 
as they arrive on campus. Stu
dents should know that intern
ships, part-time jobs, and long
term planning are all issues for 
which the Career Center offers 
help.
The Career Centers electronic 
bulletin board can solve this prob
lem if it is effectively implemented. 
While it offers a plethora of job 
listings, it is difficult to maneuver
Writer denies benefits of tax
James Stepanek
through the listings and find use
ful information. Because of this, 
many possible opportunities are 
lost because students cannot read 
the bboard easily enough.
Another big problem with Ca
reer Center is that the facilities 
do not look befitting of a top uni
versity. Students have com
plained for years that the base
ment of Warner Hall is not a pro
fessional atmosphere in which to 
hold interviews. The interview
ing rooms are cramped and the 
chaotic environment of the office 
lends to an already stressful situ
ation. While some interviews are 
held in the UC, this only proves 
that the space in the Career Cen
ter is not adequate  yet such 
temporary solutions are not the 
answer. The Career Center is most 
useful for students who already 
have a career path set in stone, 
but for students who need assis
tance in finding a direction to 
take, the Career Center offers 
little help other than a short com
puterized questionnaire. The Ca
reer Center does offer workshops 
on certain jobs, but the publicity 
for such resources is so weak that 
most students do not find out 
about them until it is too late.
The Career Center is supposed 
to help students and graduates 
find their way through the job 
search, but as it stands both still 
have trouble using it as a resource. 
Renovations and revamping are 
sorely needed.
As has become the case, I tend to get 
my inspiration from discussions with 
conservative friends of mine, and cer
tainly not from the spineless bunch at 
the GOP. The latest topic of discussion 
has been the local stadium tax which 
will appear as a referendum on the No
vember ballot this year. Currently, it is 
running way behind in the polls, which 
I quite enjoy.
For those of you who are either new to 
Pittsburgh or havent followed the issue, 
there is perceived by some to be a need 
for new stadiums for baseball and foot
ball. It is claimed that Three Rivers 
Stadium just doesnt have the necessary 
attributes to encourage people to go to 
games or to generate the proper amount 
of revenues. The owners of many base
ball and football teams around the coun
try have made it a policy of using the 
threat of moving the team as a means of 
shaking down a city to pay for a new 
ballpark. (Of course, when a city pays for 
a facility it is just another bit of money 
being siphoned off the taxpayers.)
This game has been playing out here 
in Pittsburgh with both Rooney, the 
owner of the Steelers, and McClatchy, 
the main owner of the Pirates, trying to 
con the city into providing them with 
new facilities at mostly taxpayer ex
pense. They use a number of claims that
there is a great economic benefit to hav
ing major league teams in a city, and 
thus the city would get a return on the 
investment. Luckily, the people here 
arent falling for this.
Allegheny County already has a onepercent surtax above the Pennsylvania 
sales tax. This was ostensibly for the 
purpose of funding cultural projects 
(which includes stadiums and such). 
Somehow, that money has been dribbled 
away to nowhere, so theyve come back 
with a new proposal that intends to soak 
the taxpayers not only in Allegheny 
County, but in all of the surrounding 
ones as well.
To get back to my discussion with my 
friend, he is a proponent of the plan. 
This is an evident case of where sports 
interest has overcome political and eco
nomic principles. Granted, many propo
nents (including this individual) strongly 
believe in the alleged economic benefits, 
but they use that as a cover to white
wash the immorality of the plan. A few 
arguments were put forward as to why I 
should be involved in paying for these 
stadiums, which hold absolutely no value 
for me since I neither watch nor care 
about professional sports.
He tried to run with an argument that 
it was trickle-down economics as a 
positive spin on the proposal. First of all, 
using the derogatory term for supplyside economics is an unlikely way to 
curry favor with its proponents. Sec
ondly, he was way off the mark. The 
principle of using taxpayer money (or 
just government debt) as an economic
booster is pretty much a classic 
Keynesian argument (based on the works 
of John Maynard Keynes, an economist 
of the early 20th century who favored 
state intervention). Supply-side econom
ics is rather a different bird, focused 
more on how letting people keep their 
money by reducing taxes will provoke an 
economic boom.
Once I demonstrated that his at
tempted connection of the principles was 
specious, he tried his other major tack 
which was that the economic benefits 
make it a worthy cause. His best (and 
worst) point in this regard was that 
economists dont agree whether its a 
loss or a gain. I dont see how an unre
solved subject is a compelling argument.
Of course, even if the economic ben
efits were actually there and provable, it 
would not compel me to be in favor of the 
proposal. On a basic level of principle, it 
is wrong. It is another example of redis
tribution of wealth, and as such, I sim
ply abhor it. Another sports-fanatic 
friend of mine is in favor of the tax as 
well. However, he is honest about it. His 
argument was simple: If all those people 
on welfare can take a dip out of the 
public purse, why cant I? I will grant 
there is certainly beauty in such stark, 
cynical truth. I just wish more people 
were willing to face it.

Writer spreads work with ethics
Justin Cina
Peanut butter 
and jelly  we all 
know it, we all 
love it. As kids we 
had it in an al
most dogmatic
ritual. For us college students, its the key to every last 
minute, out-of-food, Im hungry breakfast, lunch, and 
dinner dilemma. PB&J is similar to the Zen of food: it just 
is. With the PB comes the J. If, after a fun day in the sun 
with the elementary school crew, Mom served up a tall 
glass of milk, potato chips, and a diagonally sliced jelly 
sandwich, the eternal balance would be broken. The 
versatility of these rudimentary con
diments is utterly subjugated by their 
unconditional, reciprocal, and devo
tional bond in the Peanut Butter and 
Jelly Sandwich.
Although no association rivals that 
of PB&J, it has come to my attention 
that there exist other relationships 
that are also inseparable, yet remain 
elusive to our consciousness.
One such relationship is present in 
our everyday assimilation of knowl
edge here at CMU. We attend classes 
and learn about various specialized 
disciplines that affect the way we 
conduct our lives. Surely, in the fu
ture, this knowledge will influence 
the path we take and the interaction 
we have with other members of our 
community. Every lesson goes be
yond its face value as a logarithm, 
perspective cube, or balanced reac
tion and begins to affect individual 
lives. Thus, in addition to the role of 
instruction as a protagonist in any 
specific field, there is its intimate counterpart to be 
considered. Whether it contributes to our own personal 
growth or affects a global community, the application of 
any educational experience has its inseparable peanut 
butter or jelly: ethics.
We like to talk about ethics, or ethical implications, as a 
separate field from our own: Ethics is a minor in philosophy that 
anybody could receive with the proper required classes from 
H&SS. This is a fatal misconception.
Ethics applies to all of us and remains an integral counter
part of the considerations we make in any field.
There always exists a good other than our own that must be 
taken into account as an integral aspect of any problem
solving process.
Integral is a key word for describing ethics as it applies to 
us, because ethical considerations and motivations are just as 
much a part of any solution as is the immediate desired effect.
One cannot successfully resolve a problem or correctly ap
proach a solution without consider
ing the whole, which inevitably in
cludes ethics.
Math, art, drama, design  each 
discipline ultimately has its own ethi
cal considerations. No discipline is void 
of its ethical obligations to mankind, to 
earth, and to our universe.
Just because these classes arent 
termed Ethics and Math or Ethics 
and Science doesnt mean we shouldnt 
make the connection between what we 
study and what we should do or how we 
should act.
Ethics, as it applies to us in our 
studies and in our lives, is here to stay. 
It is a common thread through all our 
existence and has been for as long i 
humankind has had the capacity to 
make such decisions.
In a world where ethical decisions 
need to be addressed at virtually every 
juncture, there is no one person, re
gardless of his or her orientation here

Killing the Cut affects campusAll benefit from new art center
_________Jenny Garcia de Osuna
A heated debate has been brewing on 
campus concerning the construction of 
the Purnell Center for the Arts. If you are 
not up to date with the recent arguments, 
just check out the emu.misc.market 
bboard string of attacks called, Where 
does all the $$$ go?. Arguments against 
the prospective building range from the 
inconvenience of its construction to the 
unfairness of dedicating a whole building 
to the College of Fine Arts.
However, it remains that the Purnell 
Center is a much-needed building which 
will not only relieve the crowded aca
demic buildings, but will also enhance 
the success of the arts and performances 
at this school.
One of the great rants is the annoying 
construction on the Cut.Yes, there is 
construction going on, and it is really 
annoying. But to bitch and complain 
because the student body has to put up 
with construction for a year without 
looking at the benefits of a new arts 
building is ridiculous.
Currently, drama students do not re
ally have a place to rehearse, and end 
up taking other CFA studios to conduct 
these pratices. This causes cramping 
for all of CFA. Many of us have noticed 
art, design, and music students lug
ging often huge and heavy equipment 
on and off campus.
In fact, several music students have to 
bus downtown for classes because there 
simply isnt enough room in CFA. I doubt 
that this type of crowding is in the same 
category as that experienced by the aver
age MCS or H&SS student, who needs to 
smoosh into a room in Baker Hall to 
attend class. Granted, both are valid com
plaints, but the fact remains that CFA 
seriously needs more space. Having a 
place for the dramats to practice will ease 
the cramped studios, allowing other CFA 
students to use their studios themselves.
Also, because CFA is so crowded, many
architecture students work in Doherty 
Hall. More room in CFA for architecture 
could mean more space for classrooms in 
Doherty Hall for students in all depart
ments to use.
Overcrowding is an issue that affects 
all students in all areas. And, unfortu
nately, not all departments can receive 
more room. However, an expansion in one 
department benefits us all. More room for 
one means, eventually, more room for all.
It may be true that CMU is construct
ing this building only for its fine arts 
students, but the recent Roberts Hall
Chris Cannon
The UC is a great place and Im glad 
its here, but weaving around the big 
construction nightmare for two years 
was a bitch. And now we are asked to 
put up with construction all over again. 
But this time, theres a difference: only 
one group of students is going to be 
able to really use the building once the 
construction is complete.
was just opened as a new engineering 
building. And, in the past, Wean Hall 
and Scaife Hall were erected for science 
and engineering students as well. The 
student body put up with the annoyance 
of construction then, and we need to 
bear the inconvenience again now. As 
non-dramats, we need to get over the 
jealousy and be glad that the school is 
trying to help fellow students, even if it 
doesnt directly affect all of us.

Its clear that the campus needs renova
tions, new buildings, and facilities. The 
administration has done their part to up
grade the clusters, libraries, and services 
that students and staff rely on.
Im saying that the Purnell Center is the 
latest and greatest example of inconve
nience on campus. Im not against the fine 
arts students getting more space; we all 
know they need it. But to lose practically 
all of the Cut, an area used for recreation 
by all, to erect a building meant for a select 
group of students shows poor choice on the 
part of planning.
The grass on the Cut was fenced off 
almost all of last school year. Apparently
we were saving it to be sacrificed to the 
construction. In the summer and fall of 
1994, you could play soccer, football, and 
frisbee on the Cut. You could run, and 
jump, and (if you watched out for the man
hole cover) dive. You can still play a game 
of catch, but anyone who starts a pickup 
game on the Cut does so at their own peril.
But beyond the games and relaxation 
the cut provided, Id like to know where the 
main graduation ceremonies will be held 
in the future. This past May, they were in 
front of the UC. The gigantic main tent 
stretched perfectly across the Cut, brim
ming with people and pride. It was central 
and close and, well, perfect. There is no 
place else on campus that can provide 
such a unique commencement experience.
I agree to losing some of the Cut for a 
campus-wide building such as the UC, but 
I find no reason for the Purnell Center to be 
built in such a key area on campus. The last 
building erected for academic use, Roberts 
Hall, was built way over behind 
Hamerschlag, in an area that did not im
pose on the student body. If we are to have 
another academic building constructed to 
relieve the crowded classes, then the Purnell 
Center should offer services to all students, 
not just to the dramats.
Students, faculty, and staff should be 
actively upset. The Cut is constantly shut
down and, flame wars on emu. misc. market 
not withstanding, weve all pretty much 
put up with it. Its no secret that buildings 
the size of the UC and Purnell Center 
require vast planning and monetary com
mitment. Itd be nice if the people behind 
the projects put in the foresight, or used 
the endowment, to build a place like the 
Purnell Center, a building for the sole use 
of the fine arts, in a location that would 
not invade such a public campus area. 
Putting up with the inconvience for the 
UC was one thing; we all looked forward to 
it. But having to lose the Cut to erect 
another fine arts building is simply unfair 
to the rest of campus.

Editor's Notebook
Sore throats, sniffly noses, that 
annoying achy feeling that makes 
you want to pop Sudafed by the 
dozens and sets you dreaming 
about Grandmas chicken soup  
you know the beginning of flu sea
son is upon us when these symp
toms start coming out in full force. 
It sure is nasty trying to get any
thing done when you have the flu.
So we should definitely appreci
ate Health Services offer of free 
flu shots for students. Yet in its 
rush to be helpful, Health Services 
has apparently forgotten some
thing key  namely that, in order 
for students to trek to Morewood 
to get the shots, someone has to 
make sure they know about the 
j shots.
Flu shots were scheduled to be 
offered on three days this year. 
Two of them have already occurred 
j - September 30 and October 13.
The third and last time theyll be 
offered is this Tuesday, October 
21. Hepatitis shots are also going 
to be offered this Thursday. Think 
back.
Bet this is the first youve heard 
of any of this. Did Health Services 
poster the campus so that stu
dents would be sure to be alerted 
to this important precautionary 
measure? Nope. Did they send 
email to RAs and organiza
tional leaders telling them 
to forward it to their resi
dents or club members? Not 
a chance.
They did put the informa
tion on their Web site, but 
even computer-obsessed 
CMU students arent going  
to check a Web site for information 
if they dont think they have a 
reason to. The dates were posted 
on the cmu.misc.news bulletin 
board, which is a good start.
But how many students really 
know about this bboard? Few read 
this one; it would make a lot more 
sense to forward it to organiza
tional bboards.
People forward information
about speakers, plays, and parties 
to these bboards all the time be
cause they know itll get read by 
lots of students. If other groups 
can take the effort needed to send 
email to let students know about 
something fun to do on Friday 
night, why cant Health Services

Web site or even call up the office 
and ask them for it. But most

No one I know had heard any- heroic lengths to find out where

Its kind of interesting 
that Health Services 
seems to be making it as 
difficult as possible for 
students to get flu shots. 
Youd think it would be in 
their best interests to

state of Pennsylvania, the irony 
inherent in its lack of effort to make

No one expects Health Services 
to treat students like children and 
shepherd them through the oh-soconfusing world of sickness preven
tion. But theres a difference be
tween bending over backwards to 
make sure the entire student body 
is getting its shots and giving stu
dents enough advance notice that 
were able to decide to get shots of 
our own accord.
The only thing to do at this point 
is to publicize the last shot date.

Rules make overtime play dull
Lifes a Sport
By Carey Lefkowitz
I jinxed myself before I even entered 
the arena. Three weeks ago, opening 
night of the National Hockey League, 
and I had tickets to the Pittsburgh Pen
guins against the Los Angeles Kings. 
What did I say to my friend in the park
ing lot before the game?
I dont care if they win or lose, as long 
as they dont tie.
Alright, what I said wasnt entirely 
true, since I preferred it if 
they won rather than lost, 
but there is no event more 
humiliating for a fan than 
leaving a hockey arena af
ter three and a half hours 
with a tie game. Each team 
gets a point, and each fan 
goes home much lighter in 
the wallet, after dishing out 
a pretty penny for the most 
expensive ticket in profes
sional sports only to see an 
inconclusive ending.
Dont get me wrong, the 
game was very exciting, 
and it is always a treat to 
see a close game. Most 
people would rather see a 
close victory for their fa
vorite team instead of a 
blowout. But why should 
fans of the NHL hope for a close game 
when more often than not it leads to a 
tie? If our favorite team falls behind 
three goals after the first period, is a win 
really out of the question? The clich is 
its not over till its over, but maybe it 
is over after one team scores a couple of 
early goals.
to end the boredom in the NHL that is 
associated with ties.
Make overtime longer. Simple ideas 
first. Overtime in a regular season NHL 
game is five minutes, which is onetwelfth of the total time of regulation. 
Since a team that scores three or four 
goals in regulation is in fairly good shape 
to win, a winning team should be ex
pected to score a goal once every fifteen 
to twenty minutes. Five minutes is a 
ridiculously short time for a team to 
even set up a scoring opportunity, and 
theyre expected to score a goal?
their own zone and protect their goalie 
rather than get the extra point for a win. 
This is especially key between division 
rivals.
Players and coaches become defensive 
in overtime. If you gave each team a 
point just for getting to overtime, over
time is only a one-point swing, with only 
one point able to be gained by either side 
instead of two. This will allow teams to 
play a lot harder because theyll have 
nothing to lose, because they have al
ready earned that one point for getting 
to overtime and theyll lose a lot less in
Most goals are scored on power play the standings if they lose in overtime
opportunities, when one team has more 
players on the ice because the other 
team committed a penalty. Five min
utes does not guarantee a penalty by 
either team, especially when theyre 
playing defensively to preserve the point 
that comes from the tie instead of receiv
ing zero points for a loss. Which leads to 
my second suggestion:
Award a point for an overtime loss. 
This is the perfect solution to ties. Once 
a team gets into overtime under the

Team bounces back
By JESSICA STRELITZ
Tartan Senior Staffwriter
The CMU Womens Volleyball team 
has been busy, playing three matches 
the last two weeks as they constantly 
prepare to close out their season in 
New York at the UAA Championships.
Were looking to the NYU match 
because if we beat them, the way that 
it is set up, well get a top six spot at the 
championships, said coach Julie 
Webb, who has been reviewing video 
tapes of the opposing team and point
ing out their weaknesses to her own 
young squad.
But the road to UAAs is not an easy 
one. CMU is still only 4-21 after beatWebb was more concerned with the 
high caliber of play from her team 
than the disappointment from losing. 
The score [15-5,15-6,15-4] does not 
really reflect what we did, she said.
What Grove City did was average 22 
digs per game, an amazing amount. 
They (GC) never let a ball drop, Id be 
in mid-celebration and somehow they 
would keep the ball alive, Webb con
tinued. We did everything right and 
didnt make any mistakes. They were 
just big girls.
The defense, which has performed 
well all year, is strong but tends to be 
shaky and inconsistent when the op
ponent takes an advantage. Despite 
intense play, they sometimes menWe need to go back to square one; put

ing Chatham College, but losing to 
Carlow College and Grove City Col
lege recently.
The match versus Carlow earlier in 
the month was a 11-15, 415, 14-16 
loss in straight sets, but coach Webb 
was pleased with the teams play. She 
cited CMUs digrate of 18.3 per game as 
being incredible, and showing that the 
Tartans really wanted the ball. That dig 
rate is the second highest this year.
We are better skilled than a lot of 
the other teams that we play. Its 
the inexperience, youth, and the 
little crazy mistakes; such as block
ing and ball-handling errors; that 
cause us to lose the match. Next 
year we wont be making those mis
takes, said Webb.
The team played Chatham last Tues
day and, despite winning, played 
poorly according to Webb. CMU lost 
the first game 14-16, but swept the 
next three 15-4,15-7, and 15-10. Id 
rather play well and lose than win like 
that. But we were happy with another 
win, said Webb.
The Grove City match was another 
notch in the loss category, but again
tally break down. But the teamlead 
by their captain, senior outside hitter 
Brittany Rutter  would really be on 
unstable footing if it wasnt for the 
outstanding play of individuals.
Brittany did a great job, she has 
worked a lot to bring the team to
gether, said Webb about Rutter, who 
had 13 digs in the Grove City match.
Webb also cited sophomore Steph 
Szobota as stepping up and doing well 
in the middle, but added that when 
the team isnt passing well that her 
presence was essentially taken out of 
the play. Freshman Cindy Kos is once 
again seeing some action at the net. 
With the return of Szobota from an 
ankle injury earlier this season, Kos 
was seeing less playing time in the 
middle position. But against Grove 
City, she was back in the game and 
the two players complemented each 
other well.
Like I was saying earlier this year, 
we need to go back to square one; 
putting the ball away on the side more, 
said Webb whose squad will face 
Wooster on Wednesday in Skibo Gym
nasium at 6:30 pm.
Champions repeat in intramurals

Theyre a good group, and were 
grooming them to take over when 
we leave to keep the tradition 
going, said MVP Katie OLeary. 
It good to see them get second 
place. Most of all she was also 
proud of her team, despite the 
fact that Lacey is a tool, she 
felt that Everyone gave it their 
all, everyone played every posi
tion and were versatile. And we 
had fun.
The Majors division brought an 
exciting conclusion to the night. 
The Spirit Hit Squad raced to a 
lead on the second play of the 
opening drive on the reigning 
champions, Beta. Linebacker 
Jerry Baptise returned an inter
ception for a touchdown. Beta 
answered that tying the game on 
the ensuing kickoff at 6-6. The 
following possession by the Hit
Squad came up empty despite 
marching to the one-yard line. 
Both teams would be unsuccess
ful during the remainder of the 
first half.
An Eric Harris bomb found Link 
Brown for a touchdown. They con
verted the point after to establish
short drive later, a Shaunessey 
pass found the end zone again, 
and likewise for the extra point.
Hit Squad was unable to con
vert despite great field position 
from a shanked kickoff by Beta 
into the sideline. On the next 
possession, Beta took advantage.
Either team could have won. Both 
teams are good teams.

Shaunessey, but he was able to 
muster a pass to the endzone. 
Tyler Burke came down with it 
between two defenders.
After a scamble by Eric Harris 
and a pitch to Link Brown 
brought them across midfield,
only 35 seconds remained on 
the clock. Harris attempted an 
arching pass to a wide-open 
Brown in the endzone across 
the field. But Beta safety Steve 
Wetter stepped in front of the 
pass, and a few kneel downs 
later, the Betas had successfully 
defended their crown.
Either team could have won, 
said MVP Colin Shaunessey. 
Both teams are good teams, and 
we got a few lucky breaks and big 
plays like the touchdown by Tyler 
at the end of the game and the 
interception at the end as well. It 
was a big win.
Two titles have been successful 
defended, with two more looking 
to start their own tradition. But 
for now, the Betas, the Hoopers

Anaheims mighty duck continues to hold-out
On Net
By Jessica Strelitz
Hockey is a big sport, but this 
winter for two week the Swedes, 
Canadians, Fins, Czechs and 
Russians will bring their best to a 
tiny island nation and try some 
thing new. When it was an8,000 people. Even more, I dont 
think that the place is nearly big 
enough for Paul Kariyas ego.
I wonder if they originally 
scheduled an Anaheim Mighty 
Ducks game in
Japan during the first week of 
the NHL regular season because 
the Japanese feel a special affin
ity for Paul Kariya who is partJapanese (on his fathers side). 
Too bad he wasnt there to play, 
hes was too busy holding out for 
a better contract. Better? The kid 
just turned 23 and hes making

mixed reactions. The Nagano or

rink  the Big Hat only seats

because hes not getting his way. 
He wants a masseuse to travel

money and Disney is saying that 
they dont have it.

(511, 175) he was even tinier at

until he left

He became their lead

Last year came in runner 
up to Sabres goaltender

his whole career.

sure is acting like a big jerk. The
behavior bodes ill for the NHL in 
the Olympics... it makes me think 
that this sport is heading in the 
same direction as the NBA who 
wont even stay in the Olympic 
Village in Nagano in the Febru
ary. But right now, all seems quiet 
in the NHL-Olympic camp-to-be 
(Kariya is expected to play for 
Team Canada) but who knows. 
Maybe hell hold out for rights to 
the torch or to get a cut of televi
sion profits on airing their games.
Officials are saying that the 
Games are going to be great for 
the sport. It reflects how much 
the sport has evolved and so 
quickly  more teams, more 
players nationwide, bigger au
diences and bigger salaries. Al
lowing two-weeks for a mid-winter break so the chosen few can 
travel to Japan and break what
ever momentum playoff bound 
teams are having during the regu
lar season may prove to be a big 
mistake.
Traditionally, Olympic hockey 
was played by college men, cer
tainly not professionals. But the 
US had to run and catch up with 
Russian and European athletics 
whose government were support
ing them to world titles all over. 
How can anything compare to 
one of the greatest hockey mo
ments of all time  that of the 
Cinderella squad of Lake Placid 
in 1980  when USA took home 
the gold in the sport that was 
born upstairs in the tundra of 
Canada (actually at McGill Uni
versity in the mid 1860s)?
But that was in the USA. I 
wonder what the NHLers will be 
doing in the Land of the Rising 
Sun? I cant help it, Japan just 
isnt a place where hockey is the 
first sport that comes to mind. 
Give me hot chocolate, a good 
snowstorm and a blustery out

any sushi on the ice, Im switch

Freshman Rick Ebert, who moved up 
to the first line when Duncan was taken 
out of the game, seemed a little out of

as does fellow rookie Kevin Black.

Club sets up for second season
By CHRIS CANNON
Tartan Sports Editor
Many students used the mid-semes
ter break away to go home, go on vaca
tion, or simply veg-out in the front of a 
TV. But CMUs mens club volleyball 
team spent the break digging oppo
nents hard hits, putting spikes away, 
and tossing up wicked serves that just 
clear the net.
The club practices in Skibo gymna
sium Mondays and Wednesdays at 8 
pm, but Daily indicated that they 
wouldnt be holding official practices 
the next two weeks. The try-outs mid
semester weekend were attended by 
former coach Dennis Jensen and new 
head coach Bill Kooker.
On a good night, weve had three
teams [playing], club president Kevin 
Daily said of their weekly practices.
The team went 5-5 in their inaugu
ral season. The team has been inactive 
in the past, until CMU students re
vived the club and began playing again 
last year. Because of their record, the 
team didnt make the league playoffs, 
but participated in a Maryland tour
nament on their own.
Duke won the division last year, but 
the club almost beat the Blue Devils in 
the Maryland tournament.
Next semester well be trying to 
hold two tournaments, said Daily, in
dicating that they dates would prob
ably fall in January and at the end of 
April. The club hopes to compete in an 
away tournament in November.
I think well be at least as good as
last year, said Barry Huie, who heard 
about the team through word-ofmouth last year. The team returns a 
deep squad.
We are a much stronger team this 
year, said Daily. Last year we had 
nine people whod never played orga
nized team volleyball. According to 
Daily, theyve added two strong fresh
man. Chad Harper and Andy Mar join 
the team with high school volleyball 
experience.
I think its [that] you dont know 
what to expect from your teammates, 
said Huie about the value of an 
experienced team. If youre inexperi
enced, you might not instantly know.
Students interested in playing for 
the club should contact Daily.
Soccer team loses in close game
LOSES, from page 12
traveling half the field to the Ohio goal.
CMU was able to stretch the field in 
the second half by making long passes 
to forwards  making them chase the 
ball. This made for more offensive play, 
taking the pressure off the defense.
CMUs lost their best two chances to 
score  one 36 minutes left in the first 
half and 25 minutes into the second. 
CMUs freshmen forward Keri 
Pylphyshyn received a pass on an of
fensive push in the Ohio end 35 yards 
out from the goal. She dribbled the 
ball across the field and managed to 
get pass through sophomore midfielder 
Courtney Marrett, who was making a 
run up the right side of the field with 
no one covering her. She moved the 
ball 15 yards out at the right side of
goal and took a low shot that missed 
wide to the right.
The Tartans lost their second chance 
to score on a free kick about 40 yards 
away from the Ohio goal. The kick hit 
the edge of the penalty area in front of 
the goal where CMU scrambled to win 
the ball. A few attempts on goal were 
blocked by Ohio defenders until the 
ball popped loose to senior Mary Wall, 
who had a clear shot. But she had to 
take it quickly and lost good footing.
In the last minute of regulation CMU 
goalie freshmen Julie Spinnato came 
up with a good save, preserving the tie 
which lead the game into overtime.
CMU moved the ball pretty well in the 
first overtime, but they started to make 
mistakes on the defensive giving Ohio 
ample opportunities to score. Ohio fi
nally scored on a comer kick  part of a 
long line of offensive series for them.

Hockey club puts first win on ice
By JESSICA STRELITZ
Tartan Senior Staffwriter
The Tartans nabbed their first win 
Saturday, in a 5-2 victory over Univer
sity of Pittbsurgh-Johnstown, but had 
to endure a 7-0 drubbing by Penn State 
West two weeks ago before tast
ing success.
CMU faced PSW on October 5, 
after dropping their first game of 
the year the week before to the 
Pittbsurgh Stars, 10-1. Things 
were not looking good as the team 
knew that PSW, a perennial pow
erhouse , was out to nail the young 
Tartans to the boards. -------
Although the team was shut 
out, and only had six shots on the night, 
the squad looked 100 percent better than 
they had the week before, and definitely 
have come a long way since the begin
ning of the season.
I was expecting worse, a lot worse, 
said assistant captain Derek Jander, 
But after two periods, we were only 
down 4-0, we were doing all right. I was 
proud of them.

ods alone, but held his own despite the 
onslaught. Grad student Jon Kliegman 
finished up the game for Min and had 
nine saves.
I felt good, better than last week. I
had a lot of personal motivation for the 
game, I wanted it, said Min.
The other team kept firing on net to 
all the corners and Gil came up big 
every time, said assistant coach Matt 
Williams, who was also doing double 
duty as a defenseman. Ive never seen 
his hands and arms move so 
fast. Without Gil standing on 
his head, we would have been 
beaten 30-0.
The defensive unit also had to 
bust their tails to control the 
play in their zone, where almost 
all of the games action was. Ev
ery play was good on defense, 
said team captain Paul 
Voulgaris.
First line did a lot better than I 
expected, said Jon Berkowitz, senior

Running teams have ups and downs
By CHRIS CANNON
Tartan Sports Editor
CMUs womens cross-country team 
remained unbeaten this season Sat
urday, running away from Division I 
competition over the 5 K course at the 
Schenley Oval.
Theyve done every workout to
gether, theyve been racing together 
as a team, and thats whats going to 
pull us through, said womens coach 
Dario Donatelli.
CMU (42 points) easily outpaced 
Kent State (86), Duquesne (87), 
and Pitt (91) in the team scores. 
The 42 points, the sum of the 
womens top five place finishes, is 
the highest amount the team has 
scored in their six wins this sea
son. Donatelli suggested that if 
the team continues to improve, the 
teams combined place-finishes might 
not come to such a high total again 
until nationals.
We were hoping today would be a 
confidence builder, said senior Mel
issa Lott. I think everyone had their 
fastest time of the year. It seemed the 
team got their confidence builder, as 
the womens top five finishers each 
took at least 20 seconds off. their last 
weeks times.
The times surprised me, said junior 
Maureen McGranaghan.
It was a very fast first mile, said 
junior Margaret Powers. But the team 
indicated that the second mile featured 
a tough hill.
I have a feeling that regionals and 
nationals will be a lot faster, said junior 
Andrea Byrnes.

Im happy, but cautious, said coach 
Donatelli about the results.
Cautious because Donatelli knows that 
cross-country is a team sport. A team 
needs five strong finishes to win a meet. 
In the case of the mens team, it didnt 
come together Saturday afternoon.
We continually get people sick and
then well, said mens coach Gary 
Meckley. The men finished fourth be
hind Kent State (35), Pitt (70), and 
Dayton (77).
It was a good day for a race, said 
senior Adam Chase. But still the team 
struggled over a hilly 8 K course.
We had a let down at this time last 
year, said Meckley. Around mid-term 
time we dont do that well. The runners 
described the race as frustrating.
Id say that any path to success 
has some ups and downs, said sopho
more Bryan Meyer. Today was one 
of the valleys. Were hoping that 
UAAs will be one of the higher points 
on the path towards our ultimate 
goal: nationals.
There were some bright spots, said 
Meckley. Maliek Washington ran a 
great race today. Josh Donner, who 
has been ill, can run.
Washington was sixth overall with 
a time of 26:50, junior Kenn Oldham 
was 13th (27:13), Meyer was 18th 
(27:35), Donner 21st (27:40), and jun
ior Kelan Weiloch was 27th (27:52).

Coach, I didnt get much sleep last

sleep next week,  said Meckely. But 
thats why theyre at Carnegie Mellon 
and thats why I respect them so much.

Special teams lead OT victory
Tartans make field goal; block kick after regulation
By RYAN E. WILLHITE
Tartan Staffwriter
Our lives are filled with mo
ments we would like to forget. 
Times in which we 
fail underpressure 
and do not live up 
to our expecta
tions. The CMU 
football team is not 
an exception to 
this rule. Two 
weeks ago, they 
disappointed 
themselves as they 
were defeated 44- 
37, after leading 
27-3 at half-time.
Pat O Malley, 
probably felt the 
worst as he missed 
a couple of field 
goals that would 
have sealed the 
game. He was hop
ing to erase that 
performance, with 
one of redemption 
last Saturday 
against Washing
ton University.
The Tartans 
took the field last 
Saturday in front 
of a homecoming 
crowd of 2,121. CMU punted the 
ball away on their first posses
sion of the game, and Washing
ton looked poised to attack. How
ever, Vince Sonson ended those 
hopes as he intercepted a pass 
and returned it to the Washing
ton 13 yard line. The Tartan of
fense took advantage as Pat O
Malley kicked a 30-yard field 
goal three plays later. CMU led
3-0.
Washington returned the kickoff to their 25 yard line, and
line, Clay threw a TD pass to WR 
Ricco Parrish. The extra point 
put CMU up 10-0 and every
thing was going CMUs way.

The Tartans again dashed 
Washingtons hopes when senior 
OLB Matthew Farrel recovered 
a fumble two plays later. QB 
Russ Clay quickly started the 
attack as he completed a 10- 
yard pass to WR Rick Steiner. 
With 3rd and seven, on the 8yd
On CMUs second possession, 
Washington recovered a fumble 
by QB Russ Clay. Washington 
QB Thor Larson threw a 21-yard 
pass to WR Vernon Butler. The 
touchdown put Washington back 
into the game, as they trailed
10-7.
After, the second punt by CMU 
in the quarter, Washington re
ceived the ball on their 37 yard 
line. They proceeded to drive 55 
yards in 12 plays, and capped off 
the drive with a 
25-yard field goal. 
Both teams went 
into half-time tied 
at 10.
The second half 
of the game was 
marked by sloppy 
play on both sides. 
The teams com
bined for four 
fumbles, and one 
interception. 
Washington was 
whistled for four 
penalties, one of 
which negated a 
touchdown.
With the score 
still tied at 10, and 
seven seconds to 
go in regulation, 
Pat O Malley was 
brought onto the 
field to attempt a 
28 yard field goal. 
This kick would 
have boosted his 
confidence. This 
kick could have 
turned his luck 
around. But, it wasnt happen
ing, he missed wide right.
CMU received the ball first in 
OT, at the Washington 25 yard 
line. After moving the ball 17 
yards , it was fourth and six at 
the eight. Pat O Malley came 
onto the field again. This time it

Football teams repeat 
as intramural champs
By TONY YU
Tartan Staffwriter
Thursday night concluded the Intra
mural Football championships with Beta 
winning their second Majors title and 
the Tartan Hoopers pulling off an amaz
ing four-peat. Phi Kap stormed the In
termediate league with another title af
ter advancing from a Minors title last 
year. Phi Kap had crushed their Minors 
opponent 40-0 only a year earlier. 
Rounding off the other winners were the 
Delt Scrubs, taking over the title in 
Minors that was left behind by Phi Kapp.
Delt Scrubs outplayed Kappa Sig in a 
sloppily-played match-up that included 
a flurry of interceptions. Eventually, 
Kappa Sig capitalized on these careless 
blunders, taking a 6-0 lead in the first 
quarter off of a interception in the 
endzone. Kappa Sig came alive in the 
third quarter matching touchdowns with 
Delta Scrubs and added a safety as well. 
But Kappa Sig could not pull off the 
comeback and the game ended with a 
Delt Scrub 32-14 victory.
The offensive strategy between the 
quarterback and the receivers set the 
tone of the game and brought them back 
into the game, Jonathan Fritz 
Fantazier of DTD said. The defensive 
backs had lots of interceptions at key 
moments including especially when they 
(Kappa Sig) were threatening the 
endzone.
The blowout led to three Co-MVPs: 
Ben Reitz, Eric Greenstein, and Brant 
Partington.
Intermediate championships produced 
a high intensity skirmish between the 
two undefeated teams: the Phi Kap 
Emeralds and the SAE Shockers. Phi 
Kap scored touchdown after the opening 
kickoff. SAE began slowly with a miscued faked punt. This left Phi Kap in 
good field position and a dump pass play 
into the endzone gave Phi Kap a 14-0 
lead. SAE answered back with a similar 
play that brought it to a 14-7 score at 
half-time.
After a false start on SAE took away a 
score, a bomb from Chris Jenkins was 
caught and dropped, but ruled a touch
down by the referees. SAE would score 
again at the end of the third with a quick 
cutback by Jenkins to take the lead. But 
Jenkins was caught in the backfield
again on the ensuing extra point at
tempt.
A stellar defense that included David 
Dybes stopped SAE. Dybes would wind 
up with a slight injury but basically 
unshaken.
Dave Dybes took one for the team 
said Zach Messner after the game. On 
the following Phi Kapp possession, Nick 
Moons connected with Peter Dela Cruz 
in the endzone to recapture the lead. 
Dela Cruz had lost his footing in the 
endzone and make a spectacular diving 
catch as he fell. Nick Moons, who threw 
all three touchdowns for Phi Kap was 
named MVP. Though as far as heroics 
go, all of the players stepped up their 
play. All the players played hard, and 
played together, said Peter DelaCruz, 
who caught the game winner.
Before the night ended, the Tartan 
Hoopers A would once again reign cham
pions. Led by Kerry Riley, Katie OLeary, 
Jackie Autieri, and Jessica Connolly, 
and undefeated in the past four years,

they were heavily favored. But a younger 
Hoopers B looked to dethrone the mighty 
juggernaut. The B-team had almost 
drawn first blood, but a near touchdown 
pass on the opening drive was inter
cepted. The A-team stomped B-team for 
a 13-0 lead by the second half. Unlike 
most other opponents of the A-team, the 
B-team managed to actually score be
fore the game concluded. The B-team 
even attempted an onside kick during 
one of their final attempts to edge out 
victory, but it was not to be. The final 
score: 19-6 Hoopers A. But the B-team 
looks ready to take over the tradition.

The highlights of this event are 
just the getting together and th 
people, said Gerald Costanzo, founder 
of the Carnegie Mellon University 
Press. This getting together mani
fested itself in the gathering of cre
ative writing alumni, faculty, and stu
dents this past week for a series of 
readings and panels which celebrated 
the 30th anniversary of Carnegie 
Mellons creative writing program.
CMUs department is one of the pre
mier undergraduate creative writing 
programs in the country and is also 
one of the few which offers a BA degree 
in creative writing.
The events, which began last Wednes
day night and continued through Satur
day night, coincided with other Home
coming events.
We decided to celebrate this anniver
sary during Homecoming because there 
are activities for spouses and more for 
them to do. Also, the creative writing 
alumni only need to make one trip to 
; celebrate the creative writing anniver
sary and Homecoming, said Jim 
Daniels, current director of the creative 
writing program. Approximately 60 of 
the 300 creative writing alumni returned

Mary Kolb, Dave Roberts, 
and Neil Jordan. Three very 
different people who graduated 
at three very different times, 
all returned to their alma 
mater this weekend for very 
different reasons.
And this is where the ques
tions begin. Why did they come 
back? What memories do they 
have about CMU that have 
caused them to become so at
tached to it? What differences 
do they see in the campus, and 
in the student body compared 
to how things were when they 
were here?
In 1932, Mary Kolb graduated 
from Carnegie Tech with a BS in 
business. She has been coming 
back to reunions for the 65 years 
since. Kolb, who was one of only 
seven graduates of the Class of 
32 to attend Homecoming this 
year, came all the way from Texas 
for her 65-year reunion.
My favorite things about 
CMU were my teachers and 
friends, the fine education, and 
i that there was lots of social 
fun, said Kolb.
The friends I made, my fra
ternity, the idea that when I 
actually graduated and started 
work, I was able to use my edu
cation and things came together 
for me, and the colleges reputa
tion all were very important to 
me, said Roberts.
Friendship was also an inte
gral part of Dave Roberts college 
experience. Roberts graduated 
in 1957 with a degree in mechani
cal engineering, and is currently 
a hydroponic farmer in Connecti
cut. He has many fond memories 
of the time he spent at CMU, and 
particularly of his experiences in 
his fraternity, Sigma Nu.
Neil Jordan graduated from
Mary Kolb was one of seven returning alumni from the Class of 1932.
CMU in 1987 with a degree in 
economics and industrial man
agement, but his strongest ties 
to CMU arent because of the 
classroom education he received 
here, or because of the reputa
tion of the college.
CMU was a good place to grow 
up, said Jordan. Ten years af
ter his graduation, he is now 
working on a PhD in Health 
Services Research at the Uni
versity of Minnesota, and came 
to his 10-year reunion because 
he hadnt been back to CMU 
since his graduation. I really 
wanted to have a glory week
end, Jordan said.
Jordan and his friends tried 
to spend this weekend the way 
they spent most of their week
ends in college. I did as little 
work as possible; I drank with 
the boys; and I dated all seven 
women on campus, said Jor
dan of his past.
Both Kolb and Roberts related 
slightly tamer college weekend 
experiences of going to athletic 
events, fraternity parties, and 
other social outings. We had a
lot more parties [when I was in 
school], said Kolb.
However, if weekends were 
highlights of the alumnis col
lege careers, there were many 
other aspects of college life that 
werent so positive in their eyes. 
Kolb said that her least favorite 
part of her time at CMU was the 
commute that she had to make 
from her home to school each 
morning, and from school to 
home each evening.
For Jordan, weekdays and 
classes were just a way to spend 
time between weekends. I 
hated going to class  Pascal 
class in particular, he said.
Dave Roberts remembered 
thinking that the division be
tween colleges was a difficult 
barrier to cross. In order to 
broaden his horizons, Roberts 
spent some time with the 
Drama Department, taking 
classes and working on plays. 
He said that his horizons were 
broadened by getting involved 
with the arts, and through this 
involvement, his friends in the

Soup and Substance offers intellectual nourishment
By KEVIN BABBITT
Tartan Production Manager
Three speakers will bring African poli
tics and culture to a personal level this 
week during the International Festival. 
As part of the Soup & Substance lecture 
series, the Office of Student Affairs is 
hosting a trio of informal discussions on 
how African nations will become a part of 
the modem world, what African culture 
is about, and what the new millennium 
holds for African politics and economics.
This Wednesday, Vincent Sinabulya, 
professor of African studies at the Uni
versity of Pittsburgh, will discuss Africas
position in the new global order. 
Sinabulya will talk about how Africa is 
advancing into the 20th century and what 
steps its nations need to take to be com
petitive with others around the globe. He 
will examine some of the current prob
lems in Africa and how these problems 
can be addressed. He will also talk about 
forthcoming changes in how businesses 
are run and how technology and educa
tion will develop, as well as the organiza
tional structure of the African continent.
On Thursday, Leopald Chrysostome, a 
doctoral student at Pitt, will give a talk 
entitled Qui Es-Tu? Chrysostome is an 
African poet, and will use his poetry as a
vehicle to describe what it means to be a 
part of African culture, specifically its 
associated identity, nature, and social 
hierarchy. Much of this culture is not 
found in books but rather in spoken words 
passed from one generation to the next, 
and Chrysostome will also touch on these 
lesser-known aspects of African life.
Fridays Soup & Substance lecture will 
feature Charles Conley, director of Im
pact International Minstries, a religious 
group at Pitt. Conleys talk, entitled 
The New Millennium in Africa, will 
revolve around the prosperity of Africa 
beyond the year 2000.
The programs take place in the
McKenna-Peter-Wright rooms at 12:30 
each day. Guests are invited to bring 
their own lunch, but Student Affairs 
provides soup and beverages for par
ticipants. We provide the soup, and 
the speaker provides the substance, 
said Jennifer Church, assistant to the 
Dean of Student Affairs.
Soup & Substance promotes interac
tion and discussion on a variety of topics 
in an informal setting. Its a great op
portunity for people to hear about sub
jects in a not-so-serioUs forum, said 
Adele Chiodo, a fifth-year senior in civil 
and environmental engineering and the 
programs coordinator.
ON CAMPUS
Interview turns tables on alumni writer
Zaslow brought his daughter Jordan for her first college campus visit last weekend.
It was a joke. An angle for a story.
That's how Jeffrey Zaslow explains 
how he came to have his current job as 
the author of All that Zazz,  an advice 
column for the Chicago Sun-Times, 
which is nationally syndicated. As a 
creative writing alumnus of 1980, 
Zaslow returned to CMU this weekend 
to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the 
creative writing program. He brought 
his daughter, eight-year-old Jordan, 
to the festivities because she had never 
been to a college campus before. He 
figured that CMU was as good a place 
to start as any.
And that makes sense, seeing as how 
Zaslow built on his career at CMU to 
become one of the Universitys most 
prominent alumni. Even though he 
told The Tartan that he got his current 
job as a joke  a chance happening 
while working on another storybeat
ing out 12,000 hopeful Ann Landers 
replacements is not an easy task for 
any writer, joke or no joke. It was here 
that Zaslow laid the groundwork for his 
successes, so it was only fitting that he 
come back for the celebration and a per
sonal homecoming of his own.
The Tartan: How long has it been 
since youve been back to campus?
Jeffrey Zaslow: In 1995, when Profes
sor Schoenwald died, I came back. But I 
came back for the memorial, I didnt 
walk around campus. It is startling to 
see this building were sitting in [the 
University Center]. Skibo served our 
needs, sort of, but this is great.
TT: When you were here, what was 
your favorite place on campus?
JZ: The Tartan office because I lived 
there. I was editor-in-chief my junior 
year.
TT: Did you ever think that you would 
be interviewing celebrities?
JZ: Thats a weird question. I always 
hoped to make a living writing. When I 
said I wanted to be a creative writing 
major, my parents had faith in me. This 
is an expensive institution  thats a lot 
of money to throw at it. But I used to 
have idols who were newspaper colum
nists, so I always wanted to be a newspa
per columnist. And now I am.
TT: How did you get your first job?
JZ: I wrote a letter to 150 newspapers. 
I said, Im coming to blank to visit a 
friend, and I would like to talk to you 
about a possible job. I got back 135
letters saying, We dont want you. I got 
back 15 saying, We dont have any
thing, but well see you. I bought an 
Eastern Airlines ticket, and for three 
weeks, I went to all the newspapers on 
that lie that I was visiting a friend. If you 
just force your way in to meet someone, 
you can get a job.
TT: How would you compare CMU 
now to the CMU you knew?
JZ: When I was editor-in-chief of The 
Tartan, we got a letter from a student 
who called the fine arts majors fruits 
and the engineers vegetables. It was a 
big thing, even [then] President Cyert 
who I see has a building now  made a 
reference to it in a speech. Well, H&SS 
was in the middle, sort of the pickle on 
the plate that no one paid attention to. 
So Im an H&SS student, and I feel 
inferior. I decide Im going to apply to 
Columbia. So I become an Ivy leaguer. 
Im there a week; Im lonely. I miss my 
girlfriend. After ten days there, I call 
and ask if I can come back to CMU. To 
show you how soon it was after I left that 
I came back, my fraternity had had a 
going away party for me, and when I 
came back, they still hadnt cleaned up.
TT: Why did you come back so soon?
JZ: I dont know why I came back. I 
guess I realized that CMU is okay. By 
the time I came back, I didnt worry 
about being in H&SS anymore because 
I liked the education and no one could 
make me feel inferior. My advice to the
pkL2rkE 12gr7tg.Lgk G2rLr RDTLr. 
Zaslow graduated from CMU in 1980. He 
and Holly Hunter had a few classes together.
H&SS majors is that youre more attrac
tive than the engineers. Maybe not more 
than the fine arts majors, but.... Im 
kidding. Im kidding.
TT: How is the current campus simi
lar to the one you knew?
JZ: Oh, the kids were always moping 
and complaining. But this was one of the 
happiest times in my life. I guess, per
sonally, the work was exciting and the
students  I made good friends here. 
Ive never known weirder people than 
I knew here, but they were also won
derful.... CMU was a place where the 
outcasts could come and be accepted, 
at least by each other. In that sense, it 
was good.
TT: Would your friends ever have 
guessed that you would be. interview
ing celebrities and have the job you 
have now?
JZ: My classmates wouldnt have 
been surprised. Ive always been an 
overachiever. When I was here, we got 
the Pennsylvania Collegiate Press As
sociation to get George Bush to come 
speak. He was running against Ronald 
Reagan in the primaries. I called and 
asked if Bush would speak. We only 
had 45 members of the Press Associa
tion, but I said we had 500 so that 
[Bush] would come because he would 
only speak to large crowds. We went 
around campus picking drama ma
jors, anyone to fill the 500 people. 
When they wrote a story about it, they 
said Bush addresses 500 of 
Pennsylvanias youngj oumalists, but 
it was just a bunch of people we rounded 
up. I learned how to play the media 
game, even here.
TT: So do you think youll be inter
viewing celebrities in 10 years?
JZ: I dont know. Its a real ad
venture though.... You know, theyre 
just like we are only better looking 
and richer. But when I go to meet 
them, I want to find out How are 
they like us? because thats what 
the readers want to know aind thats 
whats interesting.
TT: So how are you like us, the cur
rent undergraduates at CMU?
JZ: Im not like you because Im i 
parent. But being back on campus, 
its such a mix of memories. The faces 
are different but they're the same.... 
Im luckier than you in one sense 
because the job market was better 
when I graduated. The newspaper 
business is harder now.
College goes so fast. I just visited 
my old fraternity, and I passed my 
mailbox, and I almost reached out for 
my mail. The last time I got mail 
there was 17,18 years ago, but it was 
an impulse. It just goes so fast. But 
you know. College isnt about the : 
work, its about hanging out and dis
covering yourself.

When I was News editor for

and I was able to attend a lecture 
given by him with fall press privi

Mother sets example for non-traditional students
Bordering Normalcy
by Carrie Jones-McGuire
Apparently this non-traditional stu
dent gig runs in my family. My mother 
went back to school when she was 42 
and I was 15. Her father had died not 
long before, which meant that his share 
of the family estate would go to her, 
giving her the first real measure of where he was.
the first person I, a dedicated procras
tinator, ever saw begin a paper two 
weeks before it was due.
But the hardest thing for her was that 
shed forgotten how to speak her mind. 
She hadnt been in a position to do so for 
many years. A good legal secretary is 
efficient, polite, organized, and hard as 
nails. Shes supposed to be smart enough 
to handle her job, but no smarter.
Its the lawyers job to be the smart 
one, the one who goes out into the 
world and conquers, the one who 
comes back from court tired and need

a good trial lawyer, but hes really 
disorganized and often late, so my 
mom spent a lot of time lying through 
her smile to clients who wondered
financial independence shed ever had. 
She quit working as my fathers legal 
secretary and went back to school to 
try to find out what it was she wanted 
to do with her life.
She had a hard time at first. This 
school thing, its a set of skills that one 
can forget or lose.
She asked me for 
study tips and help 
with papers. It sur
prised me a little that 
these skills werent

lived in a world with
out school; as far as I  
was concerned, the year started in Sep

papers was a normal human activity.
But my mom had been out of school 
for 20 years, and she was floundering. 
She compensated for her rusty writing 
skills by working her butt off, revising 
and revising draft after draft. She was

down, and answer the phone in a pleas
antly husky voice.
So when she got back into a class
room full of brash young 18-year-olds, 
she was intimidated. She didnt know 
anymore how to declare what she 
thought. She never opened her mouth 
in class. But after she turned in her
first paper, her prof took her aside 
and said, Robbin, youre a smart 
woman. You had some really interest
ing stuff to say in that paper, a kind of 
voice I dont hear much. Why arent 
you talking more in class? At the 
time, she didnt have an answer for 
him. But she thought of it later: It had 
been so long since someone told her 
she was smart, or a good thinker, 
shed forgotten she was smart. She 
knew she was competent, but not that 
she was intelligent, articulate, and 
worth listening to.
She talked to the prof about this, 
and bless him, he helped her out of 
her shell. This is the time I refer to as 
my mothers evolution-to-vertebrate 
phase. She grew a spine. She got tough. 
She really started to figure out who 
she was, and how to like that and 
make it hers. In a way, my mom and I 
grew up together.
The summers I spent temping, I 
thought a lot about my mom living 12 
years 9-to-5 in an office, working far 
below her capabilities. As I answered 
phones in a 
pleasantly husky 
voice and filed in

how brave she 
was to go back,

Activist scrutinizes gender roles
By ANDREW HOLLOPETER
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
One in two females will be confronted 
with sexual assault. One in four fe
males will be sexually assaulted. 
Chances are that you know someone 
who has been sexually assaulted, said 
Stephen Thompson, the director of 
sexual assualt services at Central Michi
gan University. Thompson, a sexual 
assault and harassment expert and 
author of the book No More 
Fear, spoke at CMU last 
Wednedsay. During his lec
ture, he provided insight into 
what he believes are the fac
tors of sexual assault, includ
ing the gender roles which so
ciety perpetuates.
[Thompson] was brought in 
to raise awareness and edu
cate our community about the 
topic of sexual assault, said 
Allison Riley, associate direc
tor of Student Life.
Thompson said that out of 
100 sexually victimized people, 
only 30 will report that they 
were sexually victimized. This 
number is indicative of rapes when the 
victim is unsure of the identity of the 
rapist. According to him, the percent
age of victims who report a rape when it 
is classified as a date acquaintance 
rape is even lower.
The reality of it is that my gender 
acts out offensively, said Thompson. 
He said the reason that there is sexual 
assault is because of the frame of mind 
of the male gender. Thompson feels 
that the main reason that sexual as
sault is such a problem is because males
feel that they are superior to women. 
According to Thompson, American so
ciety has not created an environment 
where women are able to come forward 
and feel that they are safe.
Our culture wants to transfer the 
responsibility to the female, he said. 
Why is it that we point to the person 
who was victimized?
Thompson thinks that the Lord Hale 
and Sigmund Freud concepts have car
ried down over time. Hale, like Freud,
hypothesized that women dont make 
good witnesses in sexual cases of any 
kind, and therefore, it is left to the male 
to iron out the situation.
Thompson never intended to make 
sexual assault counseling a career. He 
became involved through teaching a 
self defense course in martial arts. 
Much to his dismay, one of his stu
dents became a victim of sexual as
sault and ultimately propelled him to 
explore the subject further.
One day I received a call from the
police asking me to go to the hospi- - 
tal, Thompson said. When I got 
there, I was brought to a woman who 
continually apologized that she had 
failed me. I was extremely confused 
because I had no idea who the woman." 
was, and I told her that I did not 
know who she was. Then she ex-. ; 
plained that I probably did not recog- ; 
nize her because she was beaten up.. 
She was one of 100 women in my 
class on sexual assault defense.
Thompson felt that he had ; 
betrayed a trust that woman.; 
had placed upon him. He did 
not understand what was>; 
wrong. He has now worked on 
hundreds of sexual assault 
cases with the FBI, inter- / 
viewed over 8,000 rape vie- ; 
tims, and written numerous;; 
articles on the topic of sexual; 
assault.
First, men select a place * 
and a target. Hell pick a pi ace 
where the target feels com- ; 
fortable, like a bar or a party; ' 
Second, hell try to make the 
target feel comfortable with ; 
him. Then hell separate him- ; 
self and her from the group that they ; 
are in,.said Thompson. After that, he 
will intimidate her, making her feel ; 
like if she doesnt do it shell die. Then ; 
hell sexually violate her, and finally ; 
its over. Thompson expounds upon 
this theory in his paper about the pro
cess men go through before commit
ting sexual assault.
We have to have more education all 
the way up, said Thompson, I think we , 
need to have teachers talking about . 
equality of sexes all the time.
Homecoming events fail to live up to student expectations
STUDENTS, from page LI
Representatives from SDC, A Phi O, 
Spirit of Skibo, and other student orga
nizations worked together to plan the 
student activits, including the Bonfire 
Festivities held Friday night. About 
300 students and a few alumni went to 
the lawn behind Donner Hall to enjoy 
food and listen to Sleeping Giants, a 
local band. It gets school spirit up for 
the game. Its exciting, said Melissa
Gongaware, the captain of the 
cheerleading squad and a senior psy
chology and public policy double major.
Things like the Clippership and the 
bonfire are things that the whole campus 
can get involved in, said Chirag Shah, a 
sophomore electrical and computer engi
neering (ECE) major.
Unfortunately, due to a number of 
issues, AB or others cant really do some
thing really, really big for Homecoming
 there are problems of limited space, 
time, resources that Homecoming, per
haps justifiably, takes up for events for 
alumni, said Subhojit Mookeijee, chair 
of AB and a junior social and decision 
sciences major.
Many students who attended the 
events would like to see more participa
tion from the rest of campus.
Weve done everything from chalk
ing the sidewalks to putting flyers in
residence halls to dorm storming, said 
Andy Sadhwani, a sophomore mechani
cal engineering major and the SDC 
public relations chair.
Despite these efforts to inform students 
of Homecoming events, many felt better 
publicity would have encouraged atten
dance at events. I didnt even know about 
the Bonfire until I walked by it, said 
Sripal Mehta, a junior ECE major.
Due to either habit or ignorance or
apathy, the Homecoming culture at CMU 
among students is to stay away from it.
... but theres definitely more going on 
this year than last, and that, I guess, is 
a good trend, said Mookerjee.
If you look at Pitt, [Homecoming] is 
much more of a big deal there. Its 
about alumni here. The students need 
to get more involved. Its frustrating 
that people dont want to take part,; 
said Gongaware.

By ANNE RAY
Tartan Acting Diversions Editor
I must admit, when I first lis
tened to Jars of Clays album 
Much Afraid, my initial reaction 
was fitting for an ordinary rock/ 
pop album: a little cheesy, but 
still appealing. The tracks are 
catchy, but they employ quite a 
few devices characteristic of com
mon pop: canned orchestral parts, 
melodic acoustic chords, slightly 
ambiguous lyrics.
I Who: Jars of Clay 
I What: Much Afraid 
: Company: Bridge Building 
I Music
called Flood some years back, 
and their second album seems to 
only have increased their acces
sibility. Somehow this four-piece 
band has found a way to appeal to 
a wide audience, which is com
mendable in itself, especially in 
the current musical climate 
where angst-ridden content is 
more common than your basic 
nice n happy song.
Christian bands have some
what of a reputation for having 
messages that they try to beat 
into the listener, in addition to 
mediocre musical talent. If there

as they sound, it is lyrics like 
this that I find challenging to 
listen to, and if youre not fairly 
open-minded, you wont be able 
to stand it.
Of course, there are things on 
this album that could be im
proved. It comes across in parts 
as being overly pop-ish; the 
structures of the songs are obvi
ous, like a textbook description 
of how to write a radio hit. Verse, 
chorus, bridge, repeat, fade out.
Even so, Much Air aid has conStill, the tunes of most of the 
tracks stick in my head, which 
always endears the music even 
more to me. But I cant quite 
figure out what this bands gim
mick is. So I listen to it again, this 
time with the lyric sheet.
Oh, I get it. Theyre a Christian 
band.
That instantly makes me think 
that I suppose Ill never hear this 
band on the radio, because Chris

have a terribly wide audience. Id 
hear more Marilyn Manson on

band. What a comforting thought.

rock-like track on this album.

write an album like Much Afraid

But the songwriting is prob

Crazy Times is getting radio

message is 
subtle. Their 
subject matter

that which is 
not often heard

Theaters tend not to produce 
Long Days Journey Into Night 
very much these days. For that 
reason alone, I would suggest 
seeing it at the Pittsburgh Pub
lic. The play has become one of 
those 20th century legends of 
the stage, like A Streetcar 
Named Desire or Our Town. And 
there is greatness in it.
But Eugene ONeills most fa
mous play is also flawed: its too 
long, it meanders, its repetitive. 
Perhaps its dated for modern au
diences, who expect less blatantly 
cerebral stuff than this. Whos 
writingplays these days with lines 
like, Its like walking on the bot
tom of the sea, as if I had drowned 
long ago. As if I was a ghost to the 
fog. Perhaps this is the appeal of 
Long Days Journey  ONeill 
could get away with a three-hour 
and 20-minute philosophical fam
ily spat, because he was ONeill 
and because the play has perse
vered through half a century.
The production, directed by 
Edward Gilbert, is quietly re
spectful of ONeills play. There 
is no effort to modernize or ex
cuse what is old-fashioned.
This is particularly notable 
with the central female charac
ter, Mary Tyrone (Deborah 
Kipp), a 60-ish woman who is 
riddled with worry over the fail
ing health of her younger son, 
Edmund (James Waterston). As 
the play goes on, Mary re devel
ops a morphine addiction that 
her sons and husband hoped 
she had gotten over years ago.
She teeters on the brink of insan
ity and explodes in tantrums at 
several points. There is no effort 
to put a cap on the Hysterical 
Woman act.
Kipp, however, takes the para
noid dope fiend routine over the
flaws in ways that are indicative 
of family life. The sons keep havr 
ing the same arguments with 
their father and with each other, 
but it almost never amounts to 
anything. This is ONeills cont
inent on familial interaction -4-

top, and she is the least interest
ing actor in the play. On the other 
hand, the men  Waterston, 
James Colby as Jamie, and Tom 
Atkins as the patriarchal James 
Tyrone  are consummately 
suited for their roles, actors whose 
professionalism and presence 
generate an energy that doesnt 
permit divided attention, even 
when the script lags.
Its difficult to summarize the 
action of the play  there isnt 
much. With Marys drug prob
lems and Edmunds condition (he 
has consumption), ONeill pro
vides a dramatic situation for his 
characters to argue about and 
come to grips with each others
families argue often but rarely do 
those arguments produce a tan
gible result or change, which is 
why we have the same arguments 
again and again. But characters 
repeating themselves makes for 
drama which strains its audience.
Perhaps that is why Long Day fs 
Journey Into Night has survived: 
ONeill pulls no punches for the 
sake of a well-made play. Instead, 
he gives us a portrait of a screwedup family in which we cannot 
help but see our own follies, tor
ments, and emotions.
Long Days Journey Into Night is 
playing at thePittsburghPublic The

Psychological contempt abounds in classic film
By WLADIMIR LABEIKOVSKY
Tartan Staffwriter
Some 30 years later, Godards Con
tempt remains one of the great psy
chological mo,vies, and at the same 
time, the most poignant film about 
filmmaking. Like most canon movies, 
it has been overanalyzed, misread, 
and then shelved. As the latest in a 
series of rereleases sponsored by 
Scorsese, Contempt has a chance to 
present itself to an audience that has 
heard and read about it but have yet to 
experience the film.
What: Contempt 
Director: Jean-Luc Godard 
| Company: Strand Releasing
Contempt has been available on video 
for a long time now, but in a disastrous, 
chopped transfer caused in part by the 
tense relations between the producers 
and the director. This restored print is, 
then, necessary to view the classic movie, 
with all of the color Godard intended 
together with the vilified Cinemascope 
format the movie was shot in.
In hindsight, Contempt is seen as 
Godards lone foray into studio pro
duction. To dismiss it like that does it 
a grave disservice. The stories and in
jokes are numerous, the conflicts dur
ing production accounted for repeat
edly, but at the center lies one great 
piece of filmmaking.
The film started as an adaptation of 
a Moravia novel about the slow disso
lution of a marriage. For some rea
son, Carlo Ponti thought Godard 
would be a good director; perhaps it 
would give some artistic credibility to 
the picture. (Yes, the film industrial
ists havent really changed in the last 
30 years.) It was the most expensive 
Godard film, just because it starred 
Brigitte Bardot. Two more conditions 
were eventually imposed on Godard: 
shoot it in Cinemascope, and yes, we 
need to see her naked.
Godards contempt for the whole pro
cess is exposed throughout the film. 
Michel Piccoli plays a writer hired by 
movie producer Jack Palance to re
write (actually hack) Fritz Langs lat
est movie - an adaptation of The OdysSey- Palance is an almost over-the-top 
sleaze. Godard and Palance seem to
relish in the vulgarity of the character, 
an obvious caricature of Ponti.
The turning point of the movie oc
curs in this first act, when Palance 
offers Bardot, who plays Piccolis bomb
shell wife, a ride to his house while 
Piccoli is left to call a cab for himself. 
Bardot dislikes the idea, but Piccoli 
encourages her to go. It is in that in
stant that she realizes what he is and 
she despises it. Through the rest of the 
film, their relation will continue to 
deteriorate, with Piccoli never under
standing why the crucial instant es
caping him and his frustration eventu
ally turning to apathy.
The preoccupation with instants 
makes for a fascinating aspect of the 
movie. Film has long been a favored 
way to explore time. It becomes almost 
a paradox how a tragedy is mapped out 
in a moment, and Godard jump-cuts 
flashbacks of the scene as if examining 
it and looking in Bardots face to find 
where the contempt started and why, 
to find the moment somewhere be
tween frames.
This preoccupation with time turns 
into one of space as the couple bicker 
interminably in their apartment in the 
most celebrated sequence of the film. 
The scene disproves any argument that 
Godard cant direct actors. Though the 
sequence is heavy in dialogue, the per
formances and the editing give it the 
impression of some ritual fight
As the story continues, all rela
tionships are mapped out. Godard 
places Fritz Lang as shaman, a 
spokesman for the ancients. We 
sense a sort of connection between 
Fritz Lang and Bardots character, 
wisdoms of different natures stuck 
into the pettiness and vulgarity of 
the other characters. Contempt and 
pity are hard to distinguish this 
point, any communication worthless, 
life among men at once too messy 
and inevitable.
At the end of the film, tragedy is a 
given, life goes on in a world with no 
time. Lang films Odysseus coming 
home to a sea with no horizon. As 
Godard shouts for silence, it is not 
clear whether this atemporality is a 
blessing or a curse.
Contempt will be playing 
through October 26th at the Har
ris theater, downtown.
Movie needs more than a pretty face
By RYAN DONOVAN
Tartan Assistant Diversions Editor
To call Playing God a David Duchovny 
vehicle would be an understatement. 
Unfortunately, he drives the movie about 
as well as a one-legged man in an asskicking contest.
What: Playing God 
Director: Andy Wilson 
Company: Touchstone Pictures
Ever since Duchovny became hugely 
successful throughTVs X-Files, produc
ers must have wanted to display him 
without someone too noticeable stealing 
his thunder, like inKalifornia, where he 
performed adequately behind Brad Pitt 
and Juliette Lewis. Now he stars as 
Eugene Sands, a drugged-out doctor 
working for crime bosses, opposite a 
hardly noticeable Timothy Hutton.
If I had seen the script to the movie, I 
would have thought it could have been a 
good flick to see on a rainy day when 
youve got seven bucks burning your 
pocket. The plot has a bunch of cool 
twists, which kept me from throwing my 
popcorn at the screen. The premise of a 
doctor who lost his license getting a 
second chance to heal, but only to heal 
criminals, has loads of potential. Unfor
tunately, we might be able to say the 
same thing about Ishtar.
What truly killed this movie was the 
cheesy voice-over narration from
Beacon Communications, Inci
Eugene Sands (David Duchovny), menaces criminals in this scene of Playing God.
Duchovny. Not only is that a strike in 
itself, but it was so overused, so blunt 
about what the meaning of whatever 
was happening on the screen, that I felt 
like retching. One can only take so much 
of the narrator saying, And heres the 
point, stupid, before anger sets in.
Duchovny isnt horrible in the movie, 
only slightly more wooden than your 
average Keanu Reeves performance. He 
looks a little scared out there, like he 
realizes that there is so much pressure 
on him to drive this movie. As a result, 
he seems to hesitate, and his perfor
mance is overshadowed by just about 
everyone else in the movie.
Hutton is very good as Raymond Blos
som. Hes given an outrageous charac
ter, and runs with it. He gets all the best
lines - like when his girlfriend (Angelina 
Jolie) wants to get out of the car when 
the cops are on their tail, he says, No. 
This is a car chase. I went to consider
able expense to set this up.
There were a couple of times that the 
movie was funny. Unfortunately for the 
filmmakers, one of those times is a scene 
where Eugene Sands takes synthetic 
herqin. It was like watching Mulder take 
drugs. In fact, there were several times 
I had to ask myself if this was not actu
ally the X-Files I was watching. 
Duchovny is not very good as a bad boy.
If you like David Duchovny a lot, you 
might want to catch this puppy at a 
matinee showing. If you dont like David 
Duchovny, you might want to rent Blade 
Runner instead.Sparks fly in pit as band rocks crowd

This past Tuesday, Offspring per
formed live at the IC Light Amphithe
ater, with the energy and intensity of a 
train wreck. Their high-powered per
formance blew away the two opening 
bands, the Joykillers and Voodoo Glow 
Skulls, as well as most of the people in 
the crowd.
When I arrived there, I wondered if 
the IC Light Amphitheater was really 
an ideal place to have a concert. It was 
a small outdoor area, with a Hallow
een theme and various carnival-like 
attractions. We missed the Joykillers 
act, but unfortunately we were sub
jected to the Voodoo Glow Skulls, whose 
name I will not mention again. After 
what seemed like hours following their 
performance, the real show began.
The Offspring, except for lead singer 
Dexter Hollander, took the stage and 
began Bad Habit, from Smash. Hol
lander strode out confidently and the 
band began ripping through the tune. 
They pounded out their energy-filled 
punk tracks for quite a while, becom
ing even more frenetic as the night 
wore on. Offspring cruised through 
tracks from Ignition, Smash, and their 
new CD, Ixnay on the H'ombre.
Some of the shows highlights in
cluded Come Out and Play, I 
Choose, and What Happened to 
You? The band put on quite a show, 
jumping all over the stage engaging 
the audience.
Offspring peppered the evening 
with all sorts of events to fire up the 
audience. Before Cool to Hate, Hol
lander declared his dislike of country 
music, much to the delight of the
crowd. About halfway through th 
show, the band took an intermis:- 
sion and sat on couches on the stage, 
relaxing while intermission musip 
played in the background.
The band broke into Black Sabbaths 
Iron Man, responding to audienci 
criticism of Sabbath.
The fans helped make the concert an 
amazing experience. It was great tp 
see people crowd surfing and moshing 
and having fun while the band kept 
things going.
To close out the show, Offspring played 
Smash and Self-Esteem, perhaps 
their best performances of the evening. 
They played Gone Away, in their en
core, which didnt seem to pack the punch 
of most of their other songs. However, 
the band invited people to join them o;ji 
the stage, so about 50 did and made 
things even crazier.

France J olis Breakaway is just 
one mega-mix tape. Basically, 
you buy the album for $6.99 and 
pick a mix that is appealing to 
you. Personally, I felt that most 
of the mixes were stretched out, 
but at the same time also con
tained a strong blend of house 
and techno. A little editing is all 
the album needs. After a time, 
the beats become repetitive in 
rhythm, and the only two mixes 
on the album that are good are 
because they cut down on all the 
excess filler music.
Who: France Joli 
I What: Breakaway 
; Company: Popular
Records
Dont get me wrong: Playing a 
mix like this at Club Laga on a 
Saturday night will definitely 
pack the crowds in, but when I 
attempted to listen to this at 
home, the adrenaline rush was 
just overcoming. Most of the popu
lar techno music that we are ac
customed to doesnt have such a 
strong element of house, but if 
you need something to keep you 
up and running, its all here. Also, 
dont look for a song here; the 
phrase need to breakaway is 
about all you will get.
Let me start with the last mix, 
titled, Boomtang Boys Mix, not 
because it is the best mix on the 
album, but rather because it is the. 
easiest mix for someone who is not 
familiar with house and techno to 
pick up on. The mix is easy to 
listen to, not too heavy on the bass 
or treble, and there are no tricky 
lyrics or rhythm changes. If there 
were ever a stereotype of a typical 
techno mix in the 90s, this mix 
definitely fulfills it.
The house beats are accompa
nied by somewhat repetitive lyr
ics, but after a minute or so, you 
are no longer upset by the nature 
of the song.
Tony Greens Extended Vo
cal Mix is also brilliant, and, as 
the title implies, the mix is filled 
with vocals. The mix is some
what disappointing because the 
rhythm and pattern is very simi
lar to the Boomtang Boys Mix. 
But then again, to someone who 
doesnt listen to techno except 
at parties, its very easy to get 
the mixes all mixed up. In the 
beginning of the song, we find 
Joli telling a story from her 
childhood, only to be cut off by 
the mix again.
The extended vocals follow, and 
we are treated to a few instances 
where France Joli hold a note for 
a good 30 seconds. Her vocals are 
somewhat similar to La Bouches
in Sweet Dreams.
One element that all the mixes 
have is the mixture of rhythm, 
vocals, and background sounds. 
Im not a fan of extended mixes 
which seem to be filled up with 
junk; the EddieBaez Vocal Mix, 
that carries on for a whopping 12 
minutes, is an excellent example.
The background sounds are 
mainly echoes of the major vo
cals, but are timed so that their 
effect is full-forced. (Dont ex
pect to pick up on this unless 
you have a really good stereo 
system.)
A good five-minute portion of 
the mix is satisfying, but it 
seems as if they just copied a 
portion over and over until they 
got to 12 minutes.
In all, Breakaway is a very 
good mix tape. You cant hon
estly expect an album to have 
five excellent mixes; the fact 
that it even has two is a big deal 
in itself. Those two mixes are 
both strong, but its still not 
much to spend that amount of 
money on.
In all honesty, I would treat 
the album as a CD single: They 
give you three more mixes to 
compensate for your spending 
two extra dollars to buy the CD. 
It would, however, help if the 
two good mixes had more than 
two-line vocals.
Play satirizes brainy type

The Learned Ladies, the Kresge 
Theatres latest offering, aims to 
persuade its audience that theres 
nothing more foolish than an edu
cated fool. The CMU Drama 
Departments production of 
Molieres classic comedy has noth
ing foolish about it. Its a smart, 
well-done production all around.
The learned ladies of the title
are Philaminte (Mia __________
Wesley), her daugh
ter Armande 
(Heather Mazur), 
and her sister-in-law 
Belise (Erin Kirk).
These women use 
their vast storehouse
piece.
These paragons of intellectu
ality contrast with Philamintes 
younger daughter Henriette 
(Rebecca Soler), who just wants 
to settle down and marry the 
man she loves. She longs to be 
wed to Clitandre (Ramn de 
Ocampo), which would be fine if 
her mother hadnt gone and 
picked out another suitor for her
 Trissotin. Furthermore, 
Armande cant forgive Clitandre
Considering the subject matter, 
you could surely even justify for
going a night of homework to 
[see this play], 
ofknowledge mainly _________________________________________
for bragging and picking on other for transferring his love from her 
peoples grammar. Theyre pur- to her sister. Never mind that 
posefully exaggerated, both by she spent two years telling him 
Moliere and by the actresses who she was too purely intellectual 
play them, into caricatures of to return his materialistic carpompous intellectuals. Even worse nal love. Henriette comes off as 
is Trissotin (David Hornsby), the slightly saccharine, especially at 
pretentious poet whom they all first. Yet it soon becomes clear
worship. Director Don Wadsworth 
has a lot of fun with these charac
ters. In one scene, Philaminte, 
Armande, and Belise literally go 
into spasms of ecstasy as they 
listen to Trissotin declaim his po
etry. The poetry reading itself re
sembles a bad performance-art
that she has her head screwed 
on more securely than anyone 
else in her household.
Will Philaminte and her allies 
succeed, in the name of reason, in 
keeping apart two people who are 
obviously meant to be together? 
Or will common sense prevail?
Will Philamintes husband, wellmeaning but weak Chrysale (Jesse 
Simpson), be manly enough to dis
regard his wifes mandate and give 
the all-important parental permis
sion for Henriette to marry 
Clitandre? Obviously, since this 
is a traditional comedy. But the 
climactic wedding scene is hilari
ous all the same.
Wadsworth and the actors 
keep, the laughter at a steady 
pitch throughout the play. The 
___________ entire cast is ex
cellent. Stand
outs include Kirk 
as Blise, and 
Jodi Baker as the 
plain-spoken 
maid Martine. 
Mazur is quite 
funny as
Armande, who for some reason 
kept reminding me of one of 
Cinderellas wicked stepsisters, 
only with a bigger vocabulary. 
Also outstanding are Soler and 
de Ocampo as the young lovers.
The. acting, the direction, 
the technical aspects, and of 
course, the script itself com-! 
bine to make this production \ 
of The Learned Ladies defi-i 
nitely worth seeing. Consid-\ 
ering the subject matter, you!

The most likely question one will en
counter when trying to talk about 
KMFDMs ninth and newest album is 
what exactly its title is. Cryptically 
named with five symbols (an explosion, 
a skull-and-crossbones, a bomb, a spi
ral, and a fist) drawn by Brute, longtime 
creator of their cover art, Ive already 
seen it referred to as KMFDM, New 
Album, and something like *&%@$.
Who: KMFDM 
What: New Album 
Company: Wax Trax!/TVT

Nit-picking aside, their latest effort 
is similar to previous material but in
corporates new sounds for the first time 
that I can remember. For those unfa
miliar with the band, it has a history of 
copying itself to the point of parody and 
recycling the same sound, a strategy 
that had become a bit tedious lately. 
Perhaps the band members had the 
same mindset, and so they spruced up 
New Album with deep bass kicks, slide 
guitars, a bit of saxophone, and a bevy 
of singers. These include Tim Skold of 
Skold; Raymond Watts, better known 
as Pig; Abby Travis; and Ogre, formerly
of Skinny Puppy; in addition to KMFDM 
members Sascha Konietzko and En 
Esch. The result diversifies the music 
that usually has you looking for the 
dance floor.
The album opens 
with twinkling elec
tronics followed by 
En Eschs deep Ger
man vocals, bursts 
of guitar, a bass kick 
threatening to blow 
out your speakers, 
and a melody swiped 
from a house song.
It isnt long before 
we get to Saschas 
vocals in English 
and realize that the 
sometimes silly, 
sometimes self-referential lyrics are 
still in place, as are 
the female backing 
vocals. To be hon
est, the meaning of 
the words doesnt 
matter when the 
music behind it is 
this catchy.
This continues on the next track, Stray 
Bullet, where a twangy guitar is lay
ered with a skittery high-end synth line 
and a satisfying bass drum. I found it
impossible not to at least tap my foot to 
the chorus that talks of a stray bullet / 
from the barrel of love and proclaims 
Im the illegitimate son of God. How 
can one not have fun when its so obvious

that KMFDM loves making their music?
Leid und Elend is one of the moie 
serious songs on the album, most likely 
because En Esch sings it entirely in 
German in a normal register rather than
his usual deep style. He is backed by 
chugging guitar and a breakbeat as well 
as assorted beeps and a spacy melody.
It all works together much better 
than expected, and makes the next 
track, Mercy, seem 
rather ordinary. While it 
does have a nice groove, 
the song isnt a large de
parture from the material 
on their two recent al
bums: a nice guitar hook, 
typical lead and backing 
vocals, and a firm beat.
Of the tracks featuring 
the stylings of guest vo
calists, and, incidentally, 
their lyrics as well, my fa
vorite undoubtedly is An
archy, sung by Tim Skold. 
Once it got into my head, 
it wouldnt leave, and it 
sounded so different from 
the rest of New Album  
clear vocals that would be 
at home on any alterna
tive album, and music that 
enslaved my legs, forcing 
them to dance. I had pre

it. Ogres work on Torture doesnt

By ELIZABETH CURRID
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
In a nutshell, the 1997 student 
film festival was filled with fresh, 
exciting and original pieces... 
aside from a few minor issues.' I 
sat back, enticed with bright col
ors, excellent camera angles, and 
talented directing, impressed 
with how much creativity each 
piece evoked.
The first film, entitled Water 
White and Black, revealed Bryce 
Taylor and Russel Kapens per
ceptive directing depicting a timid 
college lad played by Ramn de 
Ocampo who is infatuated with a 
blond vixen played by Ingrid 
Nelson. Without words, the di
rectors managed to reveal the 
intense intimidation and obses
sion that de Ocampo possesses 
for Nelson.
The next film, called Phlewid, 
takes the viewer on a trip of fan
tastic sound and color with Mr. 
Lucky and his entourage and 
their search for air, prostitution, 
and height.
A Friend in Need, a silent and 
disturbing film based on the short 
story Heart of Darkness, stars 
a frenzied Lucas Izquierdo who is 
being accosted by the oh-so-suPernatural of magically whistling 
tea kettles, running water, and 
an aggressive fax machine ema
nating only the message HELP
ME! The poor boy has no choice 
but to leave in a hurry to Part 
Two of the movie, entitled, 
Frenzy, which indeed it is. 
Izquierdo is filmed racing through 
woods and into an old mansion 
where the film becomes a ball of 
confusion. Gloved hands and 
masses of people are in the house, 
and at this point I becamed con
fused and did not gain insight as 
the film progressed.
However, though as I left A 
Friend inNeed with befuddledness,
Pietri, gives a somber account of 
the repercussions of our decisions. 
A distraught man, portrayed by 
Rashad Carter, vents his marital 
problems by not only robbing a 
convenience store, but shooting 
the cashier not once or twice but 
at least 10 times, for good mea
sure I suppose. His stress outlet 
has cost him a ticket to jail and. 
more marital problems. I guess 
the moral of the story is to avoid 
shooting convenience store clerks, 
especially not repeatedly.
I sat back, enticed with bright col
ors [and] excellent camera angles ... 
impressed with how much creativity 
each [film] evoked.
I was impressed with its setting, 
camera angles, directing, and 
Izquierdos performance.
Running With the Devil, is a 
frightening but possibly rather 
candid depiction of the O.J. 
Simpson trial. Directed by W. 
Darren Prouty and starring the 
infamous Simpson himself, the 
piece cleverly uses excerpts of 
Simpson speaking from Naked 
Gun 2-1/2 and random interviews. 
The effect, which is super im
pressive, is a very guilty Simpson.
Chains, directed by Robert
All ofthis is done without words. 
Pretty impressive, eh? I left with 
a very clear interpretation of the 
film and a pity for Carter.
And that is a brief synopsis of 
the good films. There were a few 
in-betweens, but what was super 
obvious about the Student Film 
Festival was that the overall cali
ber of the films was mediocre. 
There did not seem to be a crite
rion or base level of what was 
worthy of showing to the public, 
which in essence gave the festi
val less merit. While I found My
Thoughts, which is three min
utes of a digital orange attempt-- 
ing to speak, perhaps confusing, 
but nonetheless entertaining,
Star Wars was a mockery of not 
only the classic movies but also 
the festival itself. The camera 
work resembled that of the re
cording of a family reunion, if you 
can picture it, somewhat jerky 
and wobbling. The acting, if you 
want to call socks talking to each 
other acting, was just irritating, 
and showed how low-budget some 
of the films exhibited were. It 
was almost a bash on the Trilogy 
and I was, to say the least, trau
matized to see it had met the 
criteria to be :shown.
All in all, what was clear in 
every piece was originality 
(even the Star Wars thing); 
However, I wanted to see all of 
the films have the same merit 
as Chains or A Friend in Need.
The problem was that there 
was too wide a range between 
excellent and obnoxiously 
thrown together pieces, which 
made the festival as a whole 
mediocre.
Maybe there should have 
been a guideline sheet for those 
submitting(you know, like no 
socks with googly eyes or some
thing). To the 1997 Student 
Film Festival, the ideas are 
fresh, but the camera just 
needs focusing.

Out of Africa
Were all gonna die. You can watch a movie, you 
can go to a party, you can study for an exam, but the 
end result is always the same: Youre two hours 
closer to death. Slightly more in this case.
To distract myself from this inevitability, Ive 
been thinking about getting a haircut recently. I 
dont like my hair to grow too bushy on the sides. 
Ive started absentmindedly playing with wisps at 
the nape of my neck, so I know its time.
And lately Ive done nothing with my time but float 
aimlessly through it. I wake up in the morning, I go 
to bed at night, and I have absolutely no recollection 
of what transpired in between.

Not to belabor the point, but death is coming for us 
all. Freshmen may be foolish and arrogant, but at 
least the/re going to be alive a few years after the 
upperclassmen kick off. Theyll be in an old age 
detention center where everyone is stuck magneti
cally to the walls so that they dont wander ofFlooking 
for pets that died 40 years earlier, and the one guy 
with memory will look back and think, Yup, the last 
of those smug senior bastards died last Pauly Shore 
Appreciation Day. Then Death will walk in with his 
sweaty palms and a new sickle that he picked up at 
Home Depot, peel a geezer off the wall, off to point 
bony fingers at younger couples trying to concentrate 
on their mortgage payments and waning libidos.

Cry, The Beloved Country
Were all just trying to do the best we can with 
what little we have during the short time we can 
expect to be on this tiny planet, which used to seem 
pretty big until we discovered that were just a 
change pocket of life in one of the outer circumfer
ences of the universe. So we eat our chicken pot 
pies, we laugh at our Jay Lenos and our Henry 
Kissingers, and we wrap ourselves in iron-clad 
assurances that none of us will ever be pinned 
underneath an 18-wheeler barreling down a stretch 
of crumbled asphalt with two major organs caught 
in the rear axle.

Its not classes, or TV, or fast-acting stain remov

observations. You just get to a point in your life 
where you look at an adorable little puppy and you 
think, Id really like to kick that. So you pull back 
your steel-toed boot slowly and methodically, pre
paring to deliver a crippling blow for no reason 
except that youre bored with not kicking things. 
Youre suddenly tired of green grass and gravity.
Then again, you think, its not like Im stuck at 
home taking gun repair courses from Sally 
Struthers. Ive got it pretty good, even though my 
papercut wont heal and I spilled Pepto Bismol on 
my keyboard. So you lower your boot and walk on,

Artist keeps promise to raise helH
By KATY HARRIS
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
As he sang these words last Tuesday, 
Garth Brooks prayer from his song The 
Old Stuff came true. Pittsburgh and the 
surrounding areas went Garth-crazy for an 
entire week, selling out six concerts in 
Pittsburghs Civic Arena from October 13 
through October 18.
Brooks created an instant rapport with the 
Pittsburgh crowds. His show on Monday night 
lasted a little over three hours, and each 
show got progressively longer as the week 
progressed. You guys wanna raise hell? You 
picked on the right guy, said Brooks.
And raise hell he did. Since his success 
began in the late 80s, Brooks has gained a 
reputation for wild, loud concerts with exces
sive running and smashing of guitars. Garth 
Week 97, as the concerts were dubbed by 
local country station Y108, was no exception. 
Brooks spent a good portion of his show 
jumping on top of the sets, sprinting across 
the stage, and having good-natured battles, 
usually involving guitars, with other mem
bers of his band.
Once again, Brooks had a justification for 
his unorthodox country: Our country musics
got a hell of a lot of muscle, he said before a 
particularly muscular rendition of Callin 
Baton Rouge.
The band played well together, the crowds 
were more than supportive, and the music 
was of the highest quality.
A particularly striking aspect of the con
cert was the strength of Brooks vocals 
throughout the show. Even when out of 
breath from a spontaneous sprint or two 
around the stage, he frequently stopped dead 
in the middle of the stage to deliver an 
important line in a hauntingly clear voice. 
Brooks was especially strong vocally on The 
River and The Dance.
Another force in Brooks show came not 
from the star himself, but from his fiddle 
player, Jimmy Mattingly. Mattingly was in 
perfect form for several fiddle solos during 
Callin Baton Rouge and The Beaches of 
Cheyenne. Mattinglys solo introduction to 
the groups reworked version of Aerosmiths 
Fever garnered him a standing ovation 
from the fans, many of whom had signs only 
for him.
In true Garth Brooks tradition, however, 
Brooks stole the show with his hell-raising 
performances of Papa Loved Mama, Fe
ver, and one of the crowds favorites, Aint
Goin Down Til the Sun Comes Up. He even 
climbed several hundred feet into the air on a 
rope ladder suspended from the ceiling dur
ing Friends in Low Places.
Many at this moment are probably asking! 
All of this in a country concert? Brooks has 
been both acclaimed and criticized for his 
concerts that many traditional country fans 
feel stray too far from his country roots. Bui 
Tuesday night, he was remarkably effective 
in combining the two. The flashy lighting 
effects, smoke, and electric guitars reminisr 
cent of todays popular culture were defir 
nitely present.
Mixed in, however, were several of Brooks 
quiet, acoustic songs with powerful lyrics 
such as Here I Am, The River, and The 
Dance. He made several successful transi
tions in which he finished loud, boisterous 
songs, and immediately sat down on the front 
of the stage and belted out breathtaking 
acoustic ones.
There was, amazingly, nothing that de* 
tracted from Garths concerts last week. He 
made a promise to raise hell  and he 
delivered. He sang his heart out and the 
crowd cheered their hearts out in return. And 
most importantly, he kept his oath to treat 
the music right.
Horror movie makes viewers Scream
By TOM LIANZA

From the creator of Scream 
comes yet another terrifying 
movie aimed at the college gen
eration. I Know What You Did 
Last Summer is a great movie for 
anyone who really wants to be 
scared. If Jaws kept you out of

out of the shower, this movie will 
keep you from going to sleep at 
night without checking the closet 
and looking under your bed.

out loud because it was such a 
clich. It was fortunate, however, 
that the after-school special mes
sage of dont drink and drive 
wasnt as prevalent as they could
What: I Know What You 
Did Last Summer 
Director: Jim Gillespie 
Company: Columbia 
Pictures
In their last summer together, 
four high school friends celebrate 
the Fourth of July at a big party, 
and then drive home in Barrys 
(Ryan Phillippe) new BMW. 
Barry was beyond drunk, so Ray 
(Freddy Prinze Jr.) took the 
wheel. Something suddenly 
jumps in front of the car. They 
stop to check it out, and find that 
it is a man.
The teens are faced with a prob
lem that forces the viewer to ask, 
What would I do in this situa
tion? They have their whole lives 
ahead of them, and now there is a 
dead body on the side of the road. 
They decide to throw the body 
into the ocean and pretend the 
whole thing never happened. 
Rays girlfriend Julie (Jennifer 
Love Hewitt  Party of Five)
protests, but is eventually con
vinced by the others that it is the 
only option. The four make a pact 
never to tell anyone about it.
One year later, Julie gets a let
ter: I know what you did last
summer. Someone _________
outside the circle 
knew what they had 
done, but who could 
it be? The four 
friends, reunited for 
the summer, try to 
find out who sent the 
letter. They become 
unsure if the man 
they had hit was re
ally dead.
The concept of the 
movie is fascinat
ing, based on a book 
by Lois Duncan and 
brought to the 
screen by Kevin 
Williamson.
Williamson was re
cently chosen by En

as one of the 50 most 
creative people in 
Hollywood. The film

Band redefines its sound on new CD
By RYAN D. SCHILLING
Tartan Assistant News Editor
You may remember, from sev
eral years back, a catchy tune by 
the name of Sour Times. Most 
people, whose only knowledge of 
Portishead is from that song, 
know it better by its chorus No
body loves me. These are the 
same people that didnt follow up 
on Portishead by checking out 
their debut album Dummy and 
pleasantly finding an amazing 
record. If you are one of these 
people, I urge you to listen to 
Portisheads latest, uninspiringly 
titled Portishead.
Who: Portishead 
What: Portishead 
Company: GO! Beat 
Records
I said I wasnt particularly fond 
of the title they chose, but that is 
the only thing uninspired about 
the album and the only thing I 
have to complain about. Now, the 
praise. Despite Portisheads lack 
of penetration into the main
stream, they brought about a pro
fusion of similar acts in a genre 
that they defined. Some examples 
are Sneaker Pimps, Lamb, and 
most recently, Hooverphonic. All 
these groups used the same 
method that Portishead devised
back in 1994 to produce some 
moderate success.
Whether you like these copycat 
groups or not, they unintention
ally delayed the release of 
Portisheads sophomore effort. 
While it was never Portisheads 
plan to produce Dummy II, such 
copycat groups only prodded them 
to redefine themselves. Rather 
than sampling old hip-hop mate
rial, programmers Geoff Barrow 
and Adrian Utley recorded their 
own sampling material for use on 
the new album. This effort to stay 
simultaneously original and dy
namic obviously paid off in the 
slow making of Portishead.
First, let me mention this: The 
four members of Portishead must 
have spent the last three years in 
a closet brooding together, be
cause Portishead has a constant 
feeling of darkness. Of course, the 
music still revolves around trippy 
beats, Beth Gibbons gorgeous 
voice, organs, keyboards, and 
Adrian Utley and Geoff Barrows 
masterful song writing, but this 
time there really is no comfort 
zone. This will moke Portishead a 
difficult listen for some, but trust 
me, just as on their debut, every 
track will grow on you.
When the album begins, the 
first things you hear are spooky 
keyboard notes and a crackling 
sound as if you were listening to
the album on a record player and 
not a CD. Portishead uses this 
device on many of the tracks. But 
when the laid back drum-beat 
kicks in on Cowboys, you know 
youre listening to Portishead. 
Singer Beth Gibbons distorts her 
voice almost beyond recognition 
when she wails, But dont de
spair, this day will be the 
damnedest day/ If you take these 
things from me. Honest and poi
gnant lyrics such as these perme
ate the album.
Following Cowboys is the first 
single, All Mine. This song has 
a jazzy feel with big band horns 
used throughout and Gibbons 
singing at her sultriest.
Half Day Closing is what you 
would expect if you crossed 
Portishead with Black Sabbath. 
Honestly, this is the first impres
sion it gave me as Gibbons sings 
introspective notes over synthe
sized, distorted strings.
Humming uses the same syn
thesized whir that youd often 
hear in Scooby Doo and in Mars 
Attacks, giving this song a cheesy, 
spooky feel that youre sure to 
love. Its used to a similar effect 
on Mysterons from Dummy.
Mourning Air is just classic 
Portishead. The song is actually 
two years old, originally from a 
compilation album in 1995, Help. 
That albums profits went toward
alleviating the suffering of chilr 
dren in Bosnia. Utley, a 40-year r 
old veteran jazz musician, conf 
tributes heavily on this tracks 
his bass leaping and bounding 
and his guitar trilling in backjground, complimenting the tripf 
hop beat perfectly.
Only You is the only track o 
the album that uses outside 
sources for samples, taking eleiments from The Pharcyde andj 
more interestingly, from Kei) 
Thornes Inspector Clouseauf 
theme from the Pink Panthe\ 
movies of the 70s. You hear th 
theme in random places around 
the song, adding to the song 
mysterious sound. The most wonjderfui thing on this track, though!, 
is Gibbons voice. While on many 
of the songs, Gibbons opts for  
distorted sound for her voice, on 
Only You she sounds so clos 
that she could be in your rooni 
She almost sobs the lyrics Its 
only you who tell me apart/ Who 
can turn my world and heart. i
Portishead are perfectionists, 
and this is why we waited three 
years for their follow-up. Bui 
when you think about how they 
pored over every second oif 
Portishead, making it sound juat 
right, you just listen and enjo#, 
and all the angst over the long 
wait disappears as you enjoy 
Portisheads sound noir instead.
