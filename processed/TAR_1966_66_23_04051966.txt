Congress To Discuss 
Proposed Constitution
The proposed constitution for the Student Govern
ment, which was taken out of committee last week 
and presented to the members of the Student Congress 
for their consideration in lieu of the amendments 
proposed by the Congress Chairman, will be discussed 
this afternoon on the floor of Congress.
The document, which has been ------------------------------------------------Sigma Xi 
Sponsors Talk 
By J.A. Pople
in preparation since last fall, is 
designed primarily to generate 
increased student interest in the 
government and to eliminate the 
confusion which now exists in the 
description of executive and le
gislative authority, with the ulti
mate goal of allowing the student 
government to function more ener
getically and with more efficiency.
See Editorial, Page 4, 
Consitituion, Page 5
Among its features are an all
school election of a President and 
Vice President of the Student Body, 
legislative representation based 
solely on population by living area, 
and streamlining of the executive 
and legislative branches to appro
ximately one - half their present 
size.
Constitution Committee Chair
man Joseph H. Orens, junior, elec
trical engineering, has requested 
that any Congress members who 
plan to make proposals for amend
ing the new constitution submit 
them to him in writing prior to 
todays Congress meeting at 4:30 
p.m. in the Wherrett Room, Ski
bo. The committee will study them 
over vacation, and submit to the 
Congress its final recommen
dations at the first meeting after 
vacation.
After the constitution has been 
approved by the Congress, the Exe
cutive Council, and the administra
tions Division of Student Affairs, 
it will be submitted to the stu
dent body for ratification by re
ferendum ballot. The constitution, 
as it was presented to the Con
gress last week, appears in this 
issue, to allow the student body to 
study it. It is hoped that the ra
tification procedure will be accom
plished swiftly in order that the 
Student Government for the coming 
academic year can be organized 
under the new constitutions pro
visions toward the end of this se
mester.
Nuclear ExpertDr. John A. Pople, Car
negie Professor of Chemi
cal Physics at Carnegie 
Tech will speak at a public 
lecture today at 4:30 p.m. 
in Scaife Hall auditorium.
The lecture, sponsored by the 
Carnegie Tech chapter of Sigma 
XI, national science honorary so
ciety, is entitled, Nuclear Spin 
Coupling and Electronic Struc
ture, Pople will discuss the man
ner in which certain important fea
tures of electronic structure are 
revealed by observation on the 
coupling of nuclear spins.
A theoretical chemist, Pople 
has worked extensively on mole
cular application of quantum and 
statistical mechanics. His efforts 
have been concentrated on nuclear 
magnetic resonance (NMR), He has 
been a major contributor to the 
development of the detailed theory 
of NMR spectra.

Admin. Announces
Apartment Rates
The treasurers office has announced room rates 
for Morewood Gardens E-Tower and for Colonial 
Manor apartments.
For the Morewood Gardens efficiencies, rates for 
two occupants will be $780 per occupant for the 
academic year: for four occupants, $765 per occu
pant per year.
For three girls in a Colonial 
Manor apartment which includes 
bedroom, sitting room and kit
chen, the rates will be $790 per 
occupant per year; for four, $600 
per - occupant per year.
These prices are based upon 
consideration of next years dor
mitory room and board rates,
$1036 per year. Deducting $790 
and $1036, the dormitory residence 
rate, allows $246 for food per 
girl for the year. This means

for food per girl, Tims, occupants 
will equal dormitory costs by 
spending a total of $51,29 on food

Sound Off
Doctor Zhivago
by Howard Lasnik ,
I would like to be able to say that Doctor Zhivago is an excellent 
film  but its not. It is only an excellent attempt. The film is a sort 
of Russian Gone With the Wind, what with the country laid waste by civil 
war and the laments for the old regime. Doctor aiivago does sustain 
interest for three and a half hours which is something of an accomplish
ment in itself, but there are too many structural flaws for the film to 
be totally successful.
The plot at times seems too episodic, but, nonetheless, holds toge
ther to a sufficient degree. It centers about two principal characters. 
First, there is the idealistic young Doctor Zhivago (competently but 
monotonously played by Omar Sharif), who weds Tonya (Geraldine 
Chaplin). TTien there is Lara (Julie Christie) who is fated to cross Zhi
vagos path several times. Lara is engaged in a mild affair with the wild
eyed young radical, Pasha, who is ultimately to become the neurotic 
slaughterer of reactionaries, General Strelnikov.
Lara, however, is easily seduced by the self-assured, villainous, 
upper-class Komarovsky (you know the type; theres one in every 
movie). The surprising thing about these two latter portrayals is that 
Tom Courtenay as Pasha and Rod Steiger as Komarovsky steal the show. 
Courtenay plays his part to the hilt not missing one bit oi tfte fanatical 
efficiency. And Steiger, playing the kind of role that is almost invariably 
type-cast, projects everything of the suave Komarovsky that there is to 
project. His performance confirms my earlier opinion (remember TTie 
Pawnbroker?) that Rod Steiger is the finest American actor today.
What disturbs me about Zhivago is that he does not change and the 
relationships between the others (particularly his wife Tonya ^nd his 
mistress Lara) and himself are absolutely staic. Marriage, war, revo
lution, none of these change his boy scout nature. This in itself is not 
damning. But he does not seem to be an idealist out of any profound love 
for life (which one might expect, since his name means Life), but mere
ly because he doesnt know any better. His writing of poetry is handled 
in especially poor manner. Crumpling up sheets of paper as he writes 
love poems to Lara, he simply does not suggest artistic inspiration.
Especially commendable is the photography. The camera angles are 
always appropriate and the composition is excellent. Credit should 
be shared between director David Lean and director of photography, 
Fred Young. The funeral scene at the beginning of the movie is so ama
zingly well-balanced that its effect is absolutely destroyed by the tooemotional music.
Rather than risk leaving the wrong impression about Dr. Zhivago I 
would summarize it as a good movie with several bad features rather 
than vice - versa.
Tonight We Saw
by Bob Boris
The Wings Of The Sea Gull
Guess what? Today, no review. 
I had planned on talking to you 
about The Chase, but I didnt 
have the opportunity to see it. 
No films, no quiet Saturday nights; 
then why am I here?
Im on crew. For .those of 
you not in the Fine Arts depart
ment; crew is that evening 
course dedicated to the construc
tion of main stage productions. 
The Sea Gull was opening and I 
was a member of it's run-crew. 
It was Friday night, and the tech
nical run-through was over. It had 
gone well; there was only one snag. 
The cast was dismissed; and the 
run-crew assembled on stage 
to face the director.
Gentlemen, tonight, the inter
mission scene change ran 17 min
utes and 52 seconds; but our in
termission is only 12 minutes 
long. Something must be rectified, 
somewhere. Miles, the crewhead, a big chunky guy with an 
unshaved face said: O.K. were 
gonna run that change again, and 
again; and were gonna cut hours 
off that 17 minutes and 52 sec
onds. I thought for a bit, that it 
was Friday night, and that my date 
was ticking away. And suddenly, 
Miles yelled: Boris, get your 
butt up into that fly gallery and 
pull that set out, sos that we can 
start working the change. NOW!
I scrambled, and we started 
working, and working, and work
ing. The night ticked away, my date 
faded, and we kept yanking on the 
rope to pull that set off the floor; 
Miles kept darting around the 
stage, and we kept pulling on that 
rope.
Saturday night the show open
ed. The crowd was large, and the 
show went well. We stood in the 
positions where Miles had sta
tioned us, when the Act Curtain 
fell for the intermission scene 
change. Then we all started work
ing with the methodical procedure 
that Miles had organized. Rapid, 
rythmic; we rushed to change the 
world that was on stage; with a few 
inoveable walls, and a bookcase
lowered in from the fly gallery, 
a new environment had been crea
ted. We quickly turned some stagescrews, and placed some stagebraces.
When the whole job was comple
ted according to pre-set plan, we 
ran off-stage. Miles ran to the girl 
who was stage-managing and ask
ed; how long did it take us? 
She looked at him; seven minu
tes and 25 seconds. I saw his 
face for the first time when he 
turned around. I never saw any
thing so animated, or so alive. 
His smile was enormous, his sa
tisfaction total.
He looked at me; and with ail 
sincerity said, Thank you. as he 
shook my hand.
You never see this guy. When
ever you go to a show for a few 
hours, to be where your not; hes 
back there helping you. See The 
Sea Gull if you can, or any piece 
of theatre, when you have the op
portunity. And know that when the 
world on stage changes, all the 
Miless are in the wings mak
ing sure you dont know that they 
change it.
When youre home for Easter, 
catch a play. And remember what 
you read here. For it was you who 
were my date, when, Tonight We 
Saw what happened in the wings 
of The Sea Gull.
Mainstage Play
The next mainstage drama pro
duction, Anton Chekhovs The 
Seagull will be presented on April

la Merrill, and lighting by John 
Suesse,

Reactions Of Readers Vary 
To Tartan April Fooling
by Margaret Rubel
The Tartan springs a surprise on the campus each 
year in Spring. The bomb dropped this time on March 
30 and as the last fumes of delight and disgust clear
ed away, this reporter set about evaluating campus 
reaction to the issue. Comments on the issue ranged 
over a wide spectrum of enthusiasm, from hearty ap
proval to spirited disgust.'
I couldnt tell if I was reading]
Mad Magazine or the school news
paper, what with two title pages,1 
plenty of corn . . . and was it 
cheap!, said one tactful reader.
Several girls (not necessarily the 
prime candidates for the Oughleagh 
Woman Race) thought the UWOC 
suggestion hit too close to home, 
and were afraid of showing up at 
the Greek Fling Saturday night 
in the Where What Room of the 
student union, for fear of being 
crowned winner.
Your reporter noted a few com
ments which summed up the gener
al reaction. Here is a sample:
Great! Its the issue I wait for 
all year long.
Pretty funny. One of the best pap
ers they ever put out.
I like the editor.
Clever stuff.
Ha! Ha! Ha!
Glad to see the staff brought it 
down to college level.
I havent read it. I never read the 
Tartan.
The whole thing was offensive. 
I thought the true half stunk ...
as usual.
I was really fooled.

Its easyeven fun. You listen 
to the record, then talk along

be able to speak a surprising 
number of words and phrases 
in a few hours.
For only $2.45 you can see if 
a particular language appeals to 
your interest and aptitude. Or 
learn enough to make foreign

Editorial
A Constitution For Revitalized Government
The proposed constitution for the Student Govern
ment, which appears opposite this page, was taken 
out of committee last week by the Constitution Com
mittee of Student Congress for consideration and open 
deliberation by that body. (See note below.)
In preparing this document, the committee has stri
ven, as the Tartan stated recently, to ameliorate 
two primary problems which have developed under the 
current constitution and which have seriously im
paired the proper functioning of the government: 
that the present constitution confuses executive and le
gislative functions, making unclear the delineation of 
authority and responsibility, and that the government 
has suffered from both disrespect and disinterest on 
the part of the vast majority of the students. The Tar
tan believes that the constitution Committee has suc
ceeded in meeting this challenge, for the framework 
of government outlined in the proposed constitution 
solves completely the former problem, and possesses 
a vast potential for the alleviation of the latter.
The proposed document establishes a strong, cen
tralized executive, segregates it completely from the 
legislature, and brings under its authority all 
executive responsibilities which are now in the hands 
of the legislature. All this has been achieved while 
maintaining a system of checks and balances through 
the mechanism of executive veto over the legislature, 
and legislative power to override the veto.
To these ends, the constitution first provides for a 
President of the Student Body who is to be the head 
of the executive branch, and states explicitly that this 
individual is to be also the head of the entire govern
ment and official representative of the student body. 
It makes quite clear, furthermore, the Vice President, 
who presides over the legislature and whose office 
corresponds approximately to the current office of 
Congress Chairman, possesses decidedly subordinate 
authority. The current arrangement fails to specify 
whether the head of the executive or legislative is in 
fact also the head of the government, and either con
flict between these two or their mutual lethargy has re
sulted in stagnation of the government.
Second, the committees document places in the 
hands of the executive several new responsibilities, 
for example, of supervising elections and preparing 
the student activities budget. Both of these are cer
tainly executive functions, which nevertheless have 
been under the authority of the Legislature, and which 
have been improperly performed by that body.
The potential for greater student interest in the 
government lies in the procedure by which exe
cutive officers and legislative representatives are to 
be elected. The requirement that the President and 
Vice President of the Student Body be elected at large 
from the student body in an all-campus balloting will

permit students to take a greater, more active part in 
their government, and will make the government far 
more receptive to their desires, indeed, a sounding 
board for them. It also is conducive to the possible 
future formation of student political parties repre
senting the various campus factions. The current 
system, in which the executive and legislative bran
ches each elect their own heads, certainly alienates 
the government from the individual student, and pro
vides him with virtually no opportunity to participate 
in the government.
The election of legislative representatives moreover 
offers even greater opportunity for increased student 
participation in the government. Representation in the 
legislature is to be based solely on population by living 
area (e.g., mens dormitories, fraternities, etc.) 
that is, one representative for each 100 students, 
rather than by such divisions as department, indivi
dual fraternity, or dormitory, etc. To cite an example 
of the consequences of this system, if there are 700 
fraternity men, they will have seven representatives 
rather than 12, and these would be required to cam
paign for election at large from the 700 men whom 
they would represent. This requires an active rather 
than passive role on the part of both the legislative 
representatives and their constituents, and can serve 
to promulgate increased concern among the students 
for their government.
In addition, the structure of the Executive Council 
and the election procedures for selection of legislative 
representatives will effectively cut the size of each 
body to approximately half their current size, ren
dering the government far less unwieldy and provid
ing it with the potential to pursue dynamic programs 
in a highly efficient manner.
This constitution, of course, is hardly perfect in 
every respect. Nor can all the new ideas and procedur
es embodied in it be expected to prove wholly satis
factory to all members of the student body and govern
ment. The restructuring of the executive and legis
lative branches, however, and the redefinition of the 
relationship between them, with the concomitant 
reduction in their size is precisely what is required to 
impart to the government a new dynamism and vitality.
In examining this constitution, then, it is necessary 
to adopt a pragmatic attitude. Indeed, were it not for 
pragmatism on the part of the framers of the United 
States Constitution, that amazing document would never 
have come into existence. Today, undoubtedly, changes 
in it will be made on the floor of the Congress, but 
these must be minor ones, and the broad outlines 
must remain intact, in keeping with the spirit of the 
philosophy in the context of which the constitution was 
developed.
The Tartan urges the swift approval of the propos
ed constitution by the Student Government, and antici
pates its enthusiastic reception and ratification by the 
student body.
Note: The Congress Chairman, who had previously 
presented to the Congress has own version of a con
stitution, has apparently agreed that only the com
mittees document should be given congressional con
sideration.

Loyal Opposition
The British electorate last week 
apparently heeded the advice of 
The Daily Mirror: Give Wilson 
a good majority  so that this 
time there can be NO ALIBIS I 
Our cousins across the sea gave 
him a good majority Indeed. The 
Labor majority in Commons in
creased by 48 seats to 57% over 
the near stalemate of an eleven 
seat advantage with which Mr. 
Wilson had been limping along 
since September of 1964. Under 
the British system, the govern
ment can go to the country when
ever it chooses, and of course 
Labor has chosen to do so at the 
peak of its popularity, before the 
pound weakens further and be
fore its failure to curb the Smith 
government in Rhodesia becomes 
obvious.
Although the New York Times
hails this election as the beginning 
of a new cycle in British politics, 
it can be viewed more objectively 
as only another piece of data in 
a continuum void of effective oppo
sition. Evelyn Waugh speaks of 
the era from England's great war 
effort to date: For her pains, 
England barely survived to go 
shabbily broke and socialist. The 
loyal opposition - whose very 
name, the Conservative Party, is 
an anachronism-put up the feeb
lest of efforts in this election. 
Small wonder that British elec
tion campaigns only take a few 
weeks since the only real issue 
between the parties was whether 
or not to nationalize the steel 
industry.
The two great western democra
cies seem then to be on the verge

Jazz Band Gets 
Downbeats Praise
Editor, the Tartan;
I would like to comment on the 
recent appearance of the Phi Mu 
Alpha Jazz Band from Carnegie 
Tech at the Villanova Jazz Festi
val.
It was my pleasure to be in at
tendance at this outstanding In
ter collegiate Musical Event. It 
had an old grad*  left over from 
the big band era jumping for joy to 
hear big band jazz and to see the 
response from college students. 
(Over 3,000 in attendance at the 
final performance.)
Carnegie Tech was very well 
represented by seventeen musi
cians under the leadership of Den
nis Kahle. They didnt win, but with 
stiff competition from schools with 
jazz workshops, etc. they made a 
tremendous showing.
Downbeats New York corres
pondent, Dan Morgenstern, gives 
the group special mention in 
the current issue (April 7).
The boys with a grateful assist 
from the Administration and the 
Alumni Federation made the trip 
on their own. Perhaps, next year 
the student body will see its way 
to supporting and giving en
couragement to Big Band music 
on campus. This could result in a 
winner for Carnegie Tech plus the 
association with some of the out
standing young musicians in the 
country.
Lets swing it.

Security Criticized 
For First Aid
Editor, the Tartan:
At a recent IM basketball game, 
a fraternity brother suffered what 
was obviously a badly broken leg. 
The game was stopped; and the 
player, who was initially in much 
pain was covered  but not mov
ed  as we awaited Security. Two 
officers arrived in short notice 
bringing with them a stretcher 
and blankets.
But this was not a routine 
emergency. The situation requir
ed the officers to demonstrate a 
knowledge of first aid sufficient 
to treat the broken leg. What they 
did, however, was to withdraw 
their two-way radios and ask head
quarters for instructions. Head
quarters naively ordered them to 
remove the patient and take him 
to the hospital.
But those of us who have had 
previous experience with Security 
thought that perhaps better mea
sures should be taken. By this 
time, the boy was calm and not in 
shock; and we felt safe in wait
ing for what we considered more 
competent care. The Security men, 
while reluctant to disobey orders 
agreed to call a doctor. They soon 
told us that they were calling Dr. 
Bamonte, the school physician.
Later they told us that a hos
pital ambulance, which purported
ly carried an intern, was on its 
way. Neither came; but a 
mere hour after the injury two 
city policemen came with splints. 
Since the delay had already been 
so great, we no longer insisted 
that he be moved only under a 
doctors supervision, but were now 
willing to splint his leg and put 
him on the stretcher.
To me this delay seems ab
surd. Not only did those of us in 
contact with the boy lose some of 
our concern (because we did not 
insist on a doctor), but also the 
basketball game had moved to 
another court and all but a very 
few spectators had carried their 
chairs over to watch.
But an hour after it happened 
the injury was no less serious, 
except that the boy was in less 
danger of shock.

Security Critized
Continued from Page 4
So, to whomever is on the other 
end of those two-way radios, may 
I suggest the following improve
ments: (1) that you initiate a pro
cedure for emergencies that you 
are not equipped to handle and 
educate the students in its use, 
(2) that you instruct Security of
ficers in first aid for common 
injuries, and (3) that you encour
age them to use some initiative 
in securing proper care for less 
routine cases. (One officer was 
afraid of losing his job for not 
following headquarters order to 
get the boy to the hospital in the 
Security wagon.)
Recalling, however, the pro
gress Security has made in the 
past year, I am impressed. Last 
spring a brother was injur
ed inside the fraternity house; and 
we failed to call Security. We then 
became required by the school to 
do so. And when another frater
nity reported that a brother had 
injured his back, Security came to 
pick him up in a 54 Ford sedan. 
We complained and Security bought 
its green wagon.
However, it is obvious that sim
ply having the wagon does not in
sure proper care of an inured 
student; so we are containing 
again. But what is done this time 
had better make sense, and had 
better instill in us enough con
fidence to call on Security again 
when one of our friends is hurt. 
Until such changes are made, I will 
not call on Security; and must re
commend that in the event of an 
emergency, one call either a doc
tor or hospital and allow Security 
to remain in the library until they 
become adept at telling a library 
book from a students own.

of at least a decade of control by 
the liberal parties. Mr. Wilsons 
government will last at least ano
ther five years and the Republi
can party has little chance of up
setting President Johnson or re
gaining either house in 1968. Pre
dictions on the course of these li
beral governments, other than the 
continuing extension of welfarism 
and bigger government are diffi
cult. Tbe role of the loyal oppos
ition, Republicans and Conser
vatives in these hard years ahead, 
though is easier to see.
It is hardly likely that the par
ty out of power will conform and 
hold to principles apparently con
trary to the will of the people as 
expressed in overwhelming man
dates for liberalism. The John
son - Wilson package sells. This 
is a reality Mr. Lindsay and other 
liberal republicans are aware of. 
However, a reality that more fun
damental that they are not aware 
of is the difficulty of peddling with 
the same shoddy goods when the 
other side holds the original pa
tents?

fication Test, and has been ac
cepted for admission to the third 
year class next commencing or has 
entered upon and is satisfactorily 
pursuing such course.
The registrant has successful
ly completed his third year and 
achieved a scholastic standing wi
thin the upper three-fourths for 
that year of the full-time male 
students in his class or has at
tained a score of 70 or more on 
the Qualification Test, and has been 
accepted for admission to the 
fourth year class next commencing 
or has entered upon and is satis
factorily pursuing such course.
The registrant has been pursu
ing a course of instruction which 
requires the completion of more
than 4 years of full-time under
graduate study for the first aca
demic degree, and has successful
ly completed his fourth or subse
quent year and achieved a scholas
tic standing within the upper threefourths for his last completed un
dergraduate year of the fall-time 
male students in his class, or has 
attained a score of 70 or more on 
the Qualification Test, and has been 
accepted for admission to the fifth 
or subsequent year class next com
mencing or has entered upon and

to the first class commencing af
ter the date he completed require
ments for admission and if such 
class has commenced, the school 
has certified that he is satisfac
torily pursuing a full-time course 
of instruction leading to his de
gree, and in his last full-time aca

Neither sleet nor snow nor the 
measles could keep Techs track 
team from victory over the Jean
nette Harriers in the Tech Bowl 
last Saturday. The Tartans took 
the weak Jeannette team 89-56 de
spite the soggy weather and the ill
ness of many team members.
Harry Burkholder won both the 
mile and the two-mile run, as 
members of the Tartan cross
country team swept the first three 
places in both long-distance races.
Tartan freshmen took two firsts, 
as Ron Finnin placed first in the 
shot put and Jeff Sheldon won the 
100-yard dash. Jim Brezovec, ano
ther first-year man, took second 
in both hurdles events.
Jeannettes Lou Brueggemann 
took individual honors for the day 
with a total of 17-1/4 points. He 
won the 120 high hurdles and 440 
intermediate hurdles, and placed 
second in the broad jump and tri
ple jump.
Geneva and Indiana State come 
to Tech for a triangular meet on 
Friday, April 15 at 4:30 p.m. 
Five members of the Indiana team 
stopped in Saturday to scout the

this year Indiana should be espe

Serving The College Trade.
Opportunities for the 
college student to be com
missioned a Second Lieu
tenant in the Army after on
ly two years of ROTC train
ing are now being offered.
A new Two-Year Program, au
thorized by the ROTC Vitalization 
Act of 1964, extends the advanta
ges of ROTC to students in fouryear colleges who have not par
ticipated in the ROTC program 
during their first two years.
A basic six-week summer train
ing period after the sophomore 
year takes the place of the Basic 
Course required of students in 
the traditional Four-Year Pro
gram.
A student with two years of 
college who has been selected for 
the new program and has suc
cessfully completed the basic sum
mer training, is eligible for the 
ROTC Advanced Course in his 
junior and senior years.
The Advanced Course, which 
leads to an officers commission, 
is the same for students in either 
the Four-Year Program or the 
Two-Year Program, with the ex
ception that men in the Two-Year 
Program are not eligible for ROTC 
scholarships.
In addition to the pay provided 
during the Advanced Course and the 
Advanced Course summer training 
camp, the student attending the ba
sic summer training camp receiv
es pay at the rate of $87.90 per 
month for that period.

Olive Smithe, Mrs. Dorothy Bund, 
William Bretz, Mrs. Maria Coolahan, and Romaine Russell.
Pre-judging was based on quality

of the selection.
The actual judging was based on 
musical interpretation and perfor
mance categories including intona
tion, conductors control of group, 
tone quality, diction, accuracy and 
precision, and general effective
ness of performance.
In addition to the Greek Sing 
awards, Beta Theta Pi received 
the C.F.P. Scholarship Trophy and 
Alpha Tau Omega won the C.F.P. 
Scholarship Improved Trophy.
Music for Greek Swing was pro

groups will be available at $3.50 
and $1, respectively, from panhel 
and junior CFP representatives.

to St. Louis, March 10 to 12. In 
each of these cities the choir

the alumni clan which sponsored 
the trip. Very active this year, 
the choir also has performed in
