CMU selects president
Trustees appoint Yale dean to top post
uManlrg h sImClarmng ,l9enmIr
Dr. Jared Cohon will succeed Robert Mehrabian to become CMUs eighth president.
By SHARMBLA VENKATASUBBAN
Tartan Editor-In-Chief
Dr. Jared L. Cohon, the current dean 
of the school of forestry and environ
mental studies at Yale University was 
elected to be the eighth president of 
CMU at a meeting of the Board of Trust
ees yesterday afternoon. The president
elect will take office on July 1.
After a 13-month search with an ini
tial list of over 640 candi
dates, the presidential 
search committee recom
mended Cohon to the 
Board of Trustees as their 
first choice to replace 
President Mehrabian.
Cohon is nationally rec
ognized for his expertise 
in water resources and environmental 
systems analysis. In January, President 
Clinton appointed him chairman of the 
Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board 
which was created to evaluate the 
governments treatment of nuclear waste 
disposal, storage, and shipment. The 
Board is currently evaluating the 
governments decision to name Nevadas 
Yucca Mountain as a possible nuclear 
storage site.
Cohon, who received his doctorate in 
civil engineering, from the Massachu
setts Institute of Technology in 1973,
was a faculty member, associate dean of 
engineering, and vice proVost for re
search at Johns Hopkins University be
fore joining Yale in 1992.
Im thrilled and honored to have 
been elected and a little bit scared, 
said Cohon. The University has an 
impressive reputation and its a big 
responsibility.
He met our standards  as a scholar, 
an administrator, a teacher, and through
"/ think the important thing is that 
Dr. Cohon can pick up the momen
tum. He is very good with people. 
 President Robert Mehrabian
his academic accomplishments, said 
Thomas McConony, chairman of the 
Board of Trustees. This search began 
13 months ago and Im very happy with 
the way its ended.
Not any one specific aspect of his 
background makes him uniquely quali
fied, but he will be able to extract from 
his experiences knowledge of four com
petitive universities to bring CMU to 
that level, said Brenden Mielke, a jun
ior industrial management major and a 
member of the Student Liaison Group 
that made candidate recommendations
to the Board of Trustees.
Carnegie Mellon got a good steal, he 
said. [The Student Liaison Group] is 
very happy with the decision.
In conversation, Cohon listens well to 
questions and pays attention to who he 
is talking to; those who have interacted 
with him find him a comfortable and 
versatile talker.
Hes a great thinker. He listens to 
what you are saying and synthesizes 
what he hears into his 
questions, said 
McConomy. I defi
nitely describe him as 
attentive.
He reacts well to ran
domness, said Mielke. 
He can go from a discus
sion of university policies, 
to one about an ice cream shop in his 
hometown pretty easily.
At first it was a bit discomforting to 
have [Cohon] ask a lot of questions dur
ing the interviews, but he keeps pulling 
from you and compiling it in his head 
and then coming forth with insightful 
comments, said Mielke.
Mielke said that one of Cohons main 
focuses falls on leverage of CMU 
strengths. Blurring the lines between 
areas like engineering and public poli
cies to create strong fields that are unique

There are times in your life that you have to 
make certain choices, said President Mehrabian 
last year when he announced plans for his retire
ment in 1997. Exactly 13 months after his an
nouncement, the Board of Trustees Committee 
made their choice for a new president to lead CMU 
into its second century.
Had Spring Carnival not been last week, we 
probablywould have resolved it last week. We 
thought it would be impractical to introduce him
then, said Thomas McConomy, chair of the 
Chairmans Advisory Group. Although the campus 
community was aware that the search began, few 
details were discussed.
According to McConomy, giving out any specific 
information about the candidates could be damag
ing to their careers. If youre a candidate at one 
University and youre not chosen, it can hurt your 
reputation, he said. You dont use names because 
that can be hurtful to the person that is not cho
sen.
The search began the moment the president 
resigned, said Bill Knoell, co-chair of the Board of
Trustees Committee.
Three committees were formed under the direc
tion of the Board of Trustees, each playing vital 
role in the selection process: the Faculty Search 
Committee, the Chairmans advisory group, and 
Board of Trustees Committee.
The Faculty Search Committee, comprised of 22 
faculty members, had the most grueling tasks to 
perform. Patrick Larkey, professor of public policy 
at the Heinz School, was head of the committee. 
The committee began with a list of 640 names of 
candidates from all over the country. A letter 
indicating that the search was underway and the
White Paper, an informational booklet about the 
University and the search, was sent out to 100 
universities nationwide. Nominations from friends 
of the University, such as alumni and trustees, 
were also accepted. Finally, four ads were taken 
out in publications, including The New York Times. 
They werent help-wanted ads, said McConomy. 
It was simply to announce to the world that we 
were ready to begin to consider candidates.
The candidates came from various backgrounds 
including academic and professional settings. [The 
Faculty Search Committee] had to do the very hard

Now that Dr. Jared L. Cohon has been selected to 
become the eighth president of CMU, he faces the 
task of addressing not only the concerns of the 
student body but also those of many University 
officials. While this may seem a daunting respon
sibility, most administrators agree that they 
couldnt place their hopes for the campus commu
nity in more capable hands.
Ive only talked to him a few times, but Im very 
impressed with his ability to listen and share 
information, said Don Hale, director of University 
Relations. Im impressed with his ability to talk 
and thats very valuable. Hes the kind of guy who 
will build relationships and bring together the 
kind of people who will get things done.
Cohons personable demeanor and his extensive 
credentials at many leading institutions are at
tributes that most administrators claim will be a 
positive aspect of his presidency. These qualities 
are also immediately beneficial since CMU is pros
pering in all areas, from enrollment to endowment.
Dr. Cohon has no fires to put out, said Thomas 
McConomy, chairman of the Board of Trustees. 
There are no critical issues that have to be dealt 
with  the University is in great shape.
Even though there are no major situations to 
which the president-elect will have to pay immedi
ate attention, administrators still have concerns 
about the aspects of the University that Cohon will 
focus on.

2The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  16 April 1997
Cohon speaks candidly
When Robert Mehrabian took office 
seven years ago, research dollars were 
down, the endowment was small, and a 
new University Center needed to be built. 
With these cornerstones rebuilt, and no 
pressing matters to attend to, CMUs 
new top man could have slipped into his 
office in Warner unnoticed and unfamil
iar. Just another appointee. Almost. 
Shortly before he was presented to the 
campus, The Tartan caught up with the 
Universitys next president, Dr. Jared 
L. Cohon.
The Tartan: Did you ever think you 
would be living in Pittsburgh?
Jared Cohon: No, as a matter of fact. I 
grew up in Cleveland. I spent my life 
being a Browns fan, so I definitely was 
not a Steelers fan. I used to have rela
tives [here] so Id visit from time to time.
TT: So you like sports?
JC: Yeah, I like sports of all sorts.
TT: Whats your favorite sport ?
JC: For watching, football. Although I 
have lost interest in it recently. I had my 
own personal boycott last year because 
of what happened with the Browns. [I 
like] football, basketball, baseball.
TT: What sports do you like to partici
pate in?
JC: These days golf, which doesnt 
happen very often. I used to play basket
ball for exercise. I run as often as I can.
TT: What about hockey?
JC: As a graduate at MIT I became a 
Bruins fan, so I liked hockey. One of my 
unfulfilled dreams was to be a hockey 
goalie, but I dont know how to skate.
TT: Do you have a favorite spot on 
campus?
JC: The candidates didnt get a very 
long tour. Of what I saw thats easy: the 
University Center is really awesome. The 
presidents dining room is really great.
TT: What about the College of Fine Arts?
JC: Thats a major attraction for me. 
Being as strong in the arts as it is in the 
technical fields, positions the Univer
sity in a special way.
TT: What bands do you like?
JC: I love Elvis Costello, Peter Gabriel. 
I dont know Dave Matthews latest, but 
I love his stuff. Hes got an incredible 
drummer.
TT: What specific duties would you fill 
as president?
JC: Paying attention to the daily go
ings on in Washington with federal fund
ing of research. I believe the University 
needs an increased endownment so that 
it has more stable sources for funding.
TT: In the past, youve focused on inter
disciplinary approaches to education and 
problems. Do you think thats why you 
were selected?
JC: I think that was part of it. I think 
thats why Im viewed as a good fit. 
Everything about my training, research, 
and background points toward interdis
ciplinary involvement.
TT: What should students know about 
you?
JC: What Id like them to know is that 
Im a very open person. I hope that they 
find me as somebody thats easy to ap
proach. We wouldnt have a university 
without students. Theyre the most im
portant part of CMU. I will work to find 
a way to make myself as available as 
possible to students.
TT: What movies do you like, past and
present?
JC: The English Patient, between that 
and Fargo. Of course theres The Wizard 
ofOz. A movie that probably nobody you 
know has seen 1000 Clowns. I dont 
really know why I liked that movie. 
History of the World Part II. The Star 
Wars Trilogy, especially the first one. It 
had a freshness about it that the other 
two lacked.
TT: Favorite books?
JC: Thats easy, Lord of the Rings. I 
never have read a book twice, yet I find 
myself once or twice a year reading pas
sages out of them. Especially the third 
one, Return of the King. Im very eclectic 
in my reading, so usually I have three or 
four books going at once.
TT: Do you have a comic character of 
choice?
JC: Thats one thing I dont read.
TT: What about cartoon characters? 
Do you like them?
JC: I saw Space Jam on a plane not too 
long ago. It was better than I thought 
itd be. I acquired a new respect for Daffy 
Duck. He had some great lines in the 
movie. Right now Daffys at the top of my 
list.
TT: When you were appointed to the 
Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board, 
did you get to meet President Clinton?
JC: Nope, Im still waiting for him to 
call. Someday I hope.
TT: Do you have a favorite artist?
JC: Willem de Koenig. The stuff weve 
bought in my house is mostly impression
ist type of stuff. You know who I like very 
much is [Edward] Hooper. He had an 
enormous impact, not just on art, but on 
ads. His paintings really sort of grab me.

work of finding information on 
each of the candidates, said 
McConomy. Once the committee 
had collected information about 
each candidate, they presented a 
short-list to be considered by the 
Chairmans Advisory Group.
One member from the faculty 
senate committee and one mem
ber from the Trustees committee 
visited the next round of candi
dates in their home towns. From 
these visits, the committees se
lected candidates to bring to Pitts
burgh for one day. After these 
interviews, the committees se
lected the final round of candi
dates for a two day visit with 
their spouses.
During this final trip to Pitts
burgh, the candidates were in
terviewed by University deans 
and Trustees. We spent most of 
that time with the candidates, 
from breakfast through dinner,
said Henry Galliot, co-chair of 
the Trustees Search Committee.
As the search ended, a forum 
was held for approximately two 
hours with students and faculty. 
The Chairmans Advisory group 
reviewed the information from 
the interviews and comments 
made during the forum to select 
one candidate to recommend to 
the Board of Trustees Commit
tee. Based on the extensive in
terviews we conducted over the 
last two months, we recom
mended Jerry Cohon as our 
choice, said Galliot.
The consensus was reached 
fairly quickly, within an hour or 
so, said McConomy.
The executive committee of the 
board of Trustees then visited 
Cohon in New Haven for a twohour question-and-answer ses
sion, electing him as the new 
president shortly afterwards.
Cohon stood out in the eyes of
the committee members for many 
reasons. He has a quiet self-con
fidence about him, said Galliot. 
You would have to see the inter
views to know how tough they 
are. We had the impression that 
he at least thought about the 
questions we asked. That is an 
unusual trait in an individual 
and one that could make him a 
great president.
He had a vision. He under
stands what a great university 
is, Galliot added.
McConomy said, I think hes 
super. Hes got the academic cre
dentials, research experience, and 
administrative experience.
Another factor that influenced 
the committees decision was 
Cohons age. He was, by a sig
nificant margin, the youngest of 
the serious candidates, said 
Galliot.
A student liason group, com
prised of six select CMU students,
met in October this year to begin 
gathering information about stu
dent concerns for the President. 
According to Brenden Meilke, a 
junior industrial management 
major and member of the liason 
group, three open forum sessions 
were held to collect student opin
ions. Because these meetings had 
poor attendance, the group held 
meetings invited students to 
other special meetings. They sur
veyed 48 people in all.
The group wrote an 18 page 
document on student perspectives 
about the search. The document 
was given to all the candidates in 
the final stages of the election 
process. The group members were 
also allowed to attend the open 
forum discussing the final 
candidates. After the forum, the 
students discussed the candidates 
and picked a few to recommend 
to Galliot. Cohon was among the 
candidates that the liason group
recommended.
Bryon Krug, president of the 
Student Body and a junior elec
trical and computer engineering 
and engineering and public policy 
major, said, Of all the candi
dates, Dr. Cohon seemed to care 
the most about student life on 
this campus.
According to Mehrabian, his 
role in the search was minimal. I 
refused myself from the search. I 
did not participate in the search 
at all, intentionally, said 
Mehrabian. The president can 
have a lot of influence if he chooses 
to. I dont think thats right. 
Mehrabian did meet with all of 
the final candidates. According 
to Knoell, Mehrabian was an im
portant part of the search in its 
final stages, when the candidates 
were able to evaluate the univer
sity while they were being assesed 
themselves. Youre selling the 
candidates on what Carnegie
Mellon represents. He assisted 
in selling those final candidates. 
Thats not an insignificant con
tribution, said Knoell.
Mehrabian will be working with 
Cohon to make a smooth transi
tion between the administrations. 
I have a lot of work to do in the 
next three months, he said. The 
transition will take place at con
venient time, according to 
Mehrabian, because the end of 
June marks the end of the fiscal 
year for CMU. Cohon will begin 
his term on July 1, the first day of 
the next fiscal year.
Galliot said, [Cohon] could over 
time become one of CMUs great 
Presidents and leave his mark in 
a major way.
Knoell was equally excited 
about Cohons selection. Im de
lighted with the conclusion of [the 
search], he said. We have an 
eight president that will make an 
outstanding contribution.

PRESIDENT, from page 1
to CMU, he said.  I think he has 
the ability to do that.
President Mehrabian has no 
worries that Cohon will fill the role 
well. But I dont think the new 
president needs to fill my shoes, 
he said. Hell do well on his own. 
Mehrabian hopes the capital 
campaign, which is currently in 
progress, will exceed $160 million 
by the time he leaves office. Since 
he joined CMU in 1990 the 
Universitys endowment has 
grown by $200 million. I think 
the important thing is that Dr. 
Cohon can pick up the 
momentum, he said. Hes very 
good with people. Its important to 
be able to socialize and make a 
case to tell [donors] why they 
should invest in CMU.
Ive talked to our biggest donors 
and theyre really excited, he 
added. They know him personally 
and through previous reputation. 
While Cohon felt CMU was well 
represented during the search 
process he said he only met a 
handful of students; those who 
represented student opinion in 
the presidential search.
No one can get enough student 
interaction and I dont fault the 
process at all, said Mielke. I hope 
he felt he didnt have enough 
[student interaction] because I
think thats one of his strengths  
his desire to get to know students. 
Id be disappointed otherwise.
Mielke expects more 
interaction between students 
and Cohon, a focus that was not 
considered to be one Mehrabians 
strengths. Dr. Mehrabian has 
done a lot of house cleaning, 
said Mielke. But didnt have as 
strong a student connection as 
he would have liked or as 
students would have liked.
The search began from a 
databased of 640 people from 
which search committee 
members began the process of 
gathering information about the 
candidates in order to narrow 
the list. The search was held in 
three phases, with no major 
upsets in the process. Thank 
god its over, McConomy said.
Mehrabian said that he and 
Cohon will begin working 
together immediately to ease the 
transition between the two 
presidencies. My first project is 
to get to know the University, 
said Cohon.
Cohons wife Maureen is a 
member of the Connecticut and 
Maryland bars and has been 
practicing law for 15 years.
They have one daughter, 
Hallie, who teaches third-grade 
in Baltimore.

campaign and the Purnell 
Center for the Arts. He will pass 
these efforts on to Cohon.
The capital campaign began 
three years ago and has raised 
$148 million as of March 31. 
Money from the capital cam
paign, which will go public next 
fall under the leadership of 
Cohon, will be distributed 
toward endowments, student 
and faculty programs, and 
facility improvements.
[Cohon] will play an impor
tant role in the campaign. Hell 
be the lead fund-raiser just as Dr. 
Mehrabian was the leader for his 
campaign, said Eric Johnson, 
vice-president of development.
According to John Hays, as
sociate vice president and cam
paign director, the president, 
faculty, and deans determine 
the primary objectives of the 
campaign. Those objectives are 
then balanced against those 
likely to be supported by alumni 
and other donors.
The general objectives of the 
campaign have been set, but not 
fixed. Cohon will have the op
portunity to review what those 
objectives have been, said Hays. 
Cohon will also have flexibility 
in determining the overall
budget of the capital campaign.
Mehrabian has been leading 
the campaign to raise money for 
the Purnell Center for the Arts. 
Construction on the new build
ing, which will house the drama 
department and include space for 
other CFA departments, is slated 
to begin this summer.
This has been a real strong 
area of interest for President 
Mehrabian. He has stewarded the 
Purnell Center proj ect to the great 
success its had so far, said Jay 
Carson, Director of Development 
for the Arts and Humanities.
Much of the funding is in place 
for the Purnell Center; approxi
mately 75 percent of the money 
has been raised thus far. Cohon 
will pick up the project and help 
close the gap on the remaining 
seven million dollars needed to 
complete it. According to Carson, 
the president is always involved 
whenever the university ap
proaches a donor with the aim of 
securing a large gift.
We have a history at CMU for 
each president to build on the 
foundation laid by the last 
president, said Mehrabian. I had 
a wonderful foundation to build on. 
Every president has successfully 
built on the foundation and Fm sure 
Dr. Cohon will do the same.

and just shoot the bull with them. 
Just hang out. Id like to see him
in the Skibo Coffeehouse. Id like 
him to make an effort to hang out 
in the University Center.
He sounds like a great guy, 
said Katherine Chang, a senior 
in industrial management and 
economics. Id like him to have 
the school known for other things
-------------------- than CS and
engineering. I think 
the other schools 
should be brought 
out. Make Carnegie 
Mellon more 
national, not just 
local.
Brian Bluth, a 
junior in biology and 
president of SDC, 
reinforced the 
importance of interaction. I think 
the best thing he can do is create 
an environment where, any 
student feels they can approach 
him. They should feel like they 
can walk up to him and get the 
impression they arent disturb
ing him.
Cameron Conger, a sophomore 
history major, discussed his 
disatisfaction with some aspects 
of Mehrabians tenure. Id like to
see the new president adopt a 
more pro-Greek stance than the 
current administration. Id also 
like him to encourage more mix
ing among colleges.
I expect our new president to 
provide support from his office 
for the efforts and endevours of 
the Office of Student Affairs and 
the Intrafraternity Council 
(IFC), said IFC president Eric 
Grant, a junior in IDS and 
political science. The IFC is 
pleased by the cooperation 
received lately from Student Af
fairs and Student Life, and I hope 
that these cooperative efforts are 
backed by the new person occu
pying the presidents office. Hope
fully, [Cohon] will also feel free to 
contact the fraternaties whenever 
there are issues that concern 
them.
Hopefully, he can get us back 
into the top 25 [in University 
rankings], said Lisa Rump, un
decided H&SS freshman. Id also 
like ... Cohon to restructure the 
financial aid office. I think there 
should be a seperate service just 
for financial aid, instead of just 
having the HUB.
Many students found out about 
the presidential search a few 
days before the final 
announcment.
The truth is, I dont need 
anything from him since Im 
leaving, said Emily Philquist, a 
senior in creative writing.  I never 
really saw Mehrabian, and I never 
knew what he did. I dont think 
[Cohon] will affect me.
Other wishlists were a bit more 
light-hearted: I want the new 
president to take down the fences 
around the cut. We should be 
able to play on the grass. Id also 
like him to interact more with 
the students.
Finally, as a senior, Id like him 
to give alumni access to the 
facilities, said Anjana Trivedi, 
an industrial management and 
biology major.
Sophomore mechanical engi
neering major, Ryan Shin, was 
concerned with finance. When 
he raises tuition, the students 
should know that they are get
ting something of value in re
turn. He should also work on 
getting us PAT bus passes to help 
the shuttle service.
Administrators anticipate working with Cohon
ADMINISTRATION, from page 1
are going to be issues of a rapidly 
changing technological environ
ment. We need to be prepared to 
move quickly into the new envi
ronment and make choices that 
are difficult to make at a rapid 
speed.... We expect that the new 
president will be supportive, and 
were positive about the selec
tion, said Raj Reddy, dean of the 
School of Computer Science.
Dean of H&SS, Peter Stearns, 
is impressed with Cohons blend 
of technical knowledge and lib
eral arts background that he has 
amassed at the various 
institutions he has worked for. 
He feels that it reflects the 
Universitys atmosphere and 
hopes that the president elect 
will work to strengthen that com
bination.
Every school is trying to be
come interdisciplinary. Weve been 
doing it now for 30 years, said
Robert Mehrabian, president of 
CMU. The biggest thing in all 
universities, and I think it will 
persist, is how to melt research 
into education so that the whole 
thingis a learning environment.... 
Im sure with [Cohons] strong 
background, hes got a broad per
spective and hell pick opportuni
ties and do it very well.
Im looking forward to work
ing with Dr. Cohon. I think he 
has a strong record of commit
ment to research and education 
which the Provosts office concen
trates on, said Paul Christiano, 
provost of CMU. Hes been ac
tive and engaged in community 
groups, and thats something that 
not just the Provosts office but 
the whole University has been 
interested in.
Michael Murphy, dean of Stu
dent Affairs, cites Cohons strong 
record of community involvement 
as a benefit to the University and
a goal that the president-elect has 
expressed interest in working on 
at CMU. According to Murphy, 
Cohon would like to expand the 
Universitys influence locally, 
nationally, and eventually on an 
international level.
One way that this influence can 
be extended globally is through 
attention to projects originating 
in the computer science and engi
neering colleges of the Univer
sity. According to Reddy, the next 
generation of the Internet is an 
outlet for CMU to demonstrate 
that it is on the cutting edge of 
technological research. It is also 
an element that he hopes 
Cohons support will strengthen.
In the future, Cohon should be 
looking at new ways of delivering 
education, said Hale. [This in
cludes] technological improve
ments to education and making it 
more cost-effective.... This is an 
era where universities have to see
how they can do more with less. 
Tuition increases are smaller, 
federal funding isnt growing as 
quickly as it did in the 80s.... 
CMU is a very ambitious 
institution. Its a question of how 
to feed that ambition.
While Cohon will be respon
sible for maintaining the 
Universitys financial stability 
as a whole, he must also keep an 
eye on its separate colleges to 
continue to strengthen its 
overall reputation.
Were in the midst of a capital 
campaign and all of us pigs have 
our noses at the trough, said 
Stearns. We hope the slop gets 
down to [H&SS]. I want the Uni
versity goal to succeed, but there 
also needs to be special attention 
to certain funding goals that 
H&SS has. There is no reason to 
believe that [Cohon] wont pay 
attention to these goals. 
Mehrabian stresses that the
new President is in a situation at 
CMU where he can capitalize on 
opportunities rather than face 
challenges. The question be
comes which opportunities to 
choose, and given Cohons 
qualifications and enthusiasm 
for his new position as leader of 
CMU, the administrators have 
few doubts about his ability to 
keep the institution growing in 
the right direction.
Im tickled. Im tickled because 
we got a great guy, said 
McConomy. He has the mental 
discipline to examine the fact that 
[CMU] is at the cusp and determine 
where we go in the future.
In many ways he does embody 
what the institution is about, 
said Murphy. [Hes] young, 
hard-working, a hard-charger. 
Hes down-to-earth and friendly. 
And clearly, he has high 
ambitions for the institution 
which we all share.
