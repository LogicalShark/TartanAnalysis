The other side of the fence
Students are not being taught to understand
By URIEL WITTENBERG
Special to the Tartan
A song can be sad whether its key is major 
or minor. A girl can be pretty whether she is 
dark or fair. A teacher can be excellent 
whether he barks at students or is softspoken, whether he struts from 
wall to wall or stands stock-still, 
whether his dress is drab or 
colors clash, whether he is per
sonally aloof or just one of the guys, whether 
he mounts sensational slide projector shows 
or contents himself with plain white chalk.
It would be regrettable if our passion for 
easy measures diverted our attention from 
the fundamental to the superfluous.
# # #
Let us imagine a fantasy city which is 
graced with a functional transit system, and 
where students know nothing about how to 
drive a car. We examine how students might 
receive instruction in operating a manual 
transmission automobile. We focus on the
Such a teacher is doing his students a 
service by demanding the application of 
intelligence. It seems probable that exercise 
of the mind lias a fortifying effect. In addi
tion, a foundation is more durable than a 
cupboard-full of techniques. This consider
ation carries increasing weight as our world 
changes at a greater pace.
Astutely designed exercises simply cannot 
be solved unless they are truly understood. 
Doing them reinforces the general princi
ples which must be applied, as well as stim
ulating fresh insight. Such exercises contrast 
with those imposed on less fortunate stu
dents. These are exercises in drudgery, 
requiring the student to trundle through 
endless notes seeking something fuzzily sim
ilar which he will then adapt in whatever 
arbitrary way his intuition suggests is likely 
to placate the teacher.
We can distinguish qualitative and quan
titative aspects of the superiority of a quality

spoon-fed specific instances of general results.
sub-topic of gear selection.
The instructor might seize a body of the
ory distinguishing two categories of gears: 
low (1-3) and high (4-5). Students would 
leam that low gears are for dty driving, high 
gears for country driving. A substantial por
tion of class time would be spent dealing 
with the definition of city. A categoriza
tion of small towns would be elaborated. 
Agglomeration measures would be deve
loped to establish whether a territory of 
questionable nature is of lowor high-gear 
ty pe. Special highway circumstances calling 
for low gears would be examined.
A representative test of the students mas
tery of course material might pose the ques
tion: You are on a private tour of the dty of 
Lima, in Peru. Your guide, an expert in 
operating motor vehicles, is driving you 
around. What range of gears is your car in? 
(Hintwhat type of area is Lima?)
Take the A student aside after the test 
and ask him why one would use low gears in 
Lima:  Cause its a city would be the selfassured reply. The question of what basic 
reason exists for using low gears in a city 
would be greeted with puzzlement initially, 
then impatience.
Press the A student and you will find he 
has understood that one uses low gears in a 
city; furthermore, he can accept, when the 
proposition is put to him, that in a city it is 
desirable that cars go relatively slowly, for 
safety reasons. Tragically, however, the cru
cial connection has been neglected. It will 
come as a total revelation to him that low 
gears are associated with low speeds. This 
insight achieved, an avalanche of trivia will 
fall together and gel into a secure whole. He 
will see why low gears are used on highway 
detours, and why, late at night, when traffic 
is sparse, high gears are permissible in the 
city.
The problem, laughable in this simple 
illustration, is one which not all CMU 
courses are immune to: students not being 
taught to really understand what they are 
doing. Students leam to mimic procedures 
for which they, and sometimes their instruc
tors, dont see any logical rationale.
A great teacher approaches his subject like 
a theoretical scientist or mathematician, 
desiring to pare away inessential clutter, to 
articulate the basic principles and axioms 
from which the rest can be derived. Since he 
is conveying a foundation and appealing to 
creative reasoning faculties, his problem sets 
and tests can pose original questions, rather 
than variations of questions from class notes 
whose solutions were to be memorized.
education. There is the obvious benefit of 
exercising the mind and developing an inde
pendent thinking ability. In addition, 
organized information linked in a logical 
structure is more efficiently and compactly 
represented than a helter-skelter grab-bag of 
facts and techniques. Thus a fixed set of 
skills is more quickly transmitted in the 
former manner.
Many courses fall short of the ideal sug
gested here. One reason is that, although for 
a given quantity of education, course qual
ity varies inversely with total expenditure of 
time (cumulating over teacher and stu
dents), rendering good courses more effi
cient, it also varies direcdy with the 
instructors investment of time, and it is he 
who decides.
Another reason for which we dont 
observe greater exploitation of potential effi
ciency gains is what might be termed an 
underdeveloped infrastructure. Instructors 
sometimes discard the potent tools of 
abstraction and generality because students 
do not cope well with them. In certain cases, 
students difficulties with abstraction 
explain their readiness to charge that a 
course is too theoretical. Theory appears 
irrevelant because the link to applications is 
dimly perceived.
Todays teacher faces students who are 
accustomed to being spoon-fed specific 
instances of general results, students who 
have been encouraged to accept and to pro
duce arguments and rationalizations 
(because Lima is a city!) which are not 
valid. A teacher may be reluctant to unleash 
this sickly fertile inferential process on 
abstract assertions that are not explicitly 
anchored to the specific results he wishes to 
convey.
The neglect of generality is perhaps most 
striking where one would think generality is 
indispensable, in the definitions of technical 
terms. Often, the ambiguous or nonsensical 
definition proposed to students is merely 
a gesture of deference to scholarly tradition, 
a gesture incorporating a quick heave to 
transfer the burden of exposition to a set of 
illustrations which exemplify the use of the 
term.
I have argued that the underdeveloped 
infrastructure influences educational 
methodology. But what development there 
is can also be retarded by certain aspects of 
the students academic experience.
An appreciation of generalization is the 
central, crucial component of the infrastruc
ture referred to here. But students cannot 
deal with generalization if they do not know
how to grasp assertions precisely and 
thoroughly. It is not uncommon for reading 
assignments to have negative effects in this 
regard.
Often a reading assignment, particularly 
one involving journal articles, is beyond the 
students thorough comprehension. The 
intention of the assignment is that the stu
dent capture the gist, or major theme. 
Thus is the habit inculcated of relying on 
vague connotations to interpret text, and of 
insouciandy skipping sentences, para
graphs and passages that are incomprehens
ible. The students illusion that he 
understands what he has read is sustained by 
a superficial treatment of the material, in 
class and on assignments and tests.
The use of Lima-like reasoning also has a 
damaging effect. In the short term, shaky 
rationalizations about why some result is 
true serve as an expedient mnemonic. But 
with each such story that is passed off as 
logical argument or proof, the student is 
made more susceptible to the world outside 
the classroom, where stories are sometimes 
told that do not end happily with correct 
conclusions.
There is a certain mystical faith, prevalent 
in our culture, that the best among us, men 
and women of exceptional character and 
ability, those with true mettle, will over
come all obstacles and inexorably reach suc
cess. I argue that it is plausible that society is 
losing able students, logical and clear 
thinkers who drop out of high school or 
university, unable to withstand the confu
sion they encounter in their textbooks and 
in the classroom. Bad teaching may indeed 
perform a screening function, but it would 
be a feat of optimism to conclude that the 
resultant selection is socially desirable.
The desirability of a clear thinking ability 
does not depend on the claim that it would 
deepen and expand the scope of subsequent, 
specialized education. There are other social 
benefits to which most of us would ascribe 
fundamental value, some of which I briefly 
mention here.
First, in an aesthetic and moral sense, a 
culture is enhanced when it is composed of 
individuals who can examine themselves 
clearly, who can communicate with others 
effectively and examine new ideas critically. 
The essay by George Orwell, Politics and 
the English Language (published in the 
June, 1946 issue of Horizon magazine), dis
cusses the relationship between moral decay 
and imprecise thought and language.
Next, our political system is democratic. 
It is difficult to question the advantages of 
having an educated class that is better able to 
think critically if one believes in the ideals of 
true democracy. The importance of a clearA more discriminating consumer

The 100-watt construction permit came 
July, and we almost threw it away, 
-ailed Barksdale Garbee, WRCT Chief

New equipment includes a transmitter, 
uipment rack, tone generator, and remote 
ntrol system which is microprocessorsed. One of the longest delays, according 
Garbee, was waiting for the equipment 
:k because the first one had been stolen 
iring shipping, and never found.
Things got rolling in July, said Gare, but there were lots and lots of delays. It 
ok only about six evenings and two weends to get the equipment working 
operly.
Formerly Class D, WRCT is now a Class 
radio station (class is related to power, and 
order from lowest to highest is D, A, B, 
(and has gone from our former status to a
station with the full protection of the FCC

Pane has been a member of the senate for 
three years now, and he has seen his share of 
apathy, stagnant committees and lack of 
respect. But this year he feels differently. 
There is some strong initiative being taken 
on the part of our new members this year, 
and that is suprising. Usually during the 
first few meetings new members will spend 
their time just trying to figure out what is 
going on. This years eight or nine new 
members have already started to speak out

sign.

Innovation is also important to Music 
Director Mark Iskowitz. We now have the 
chance to revitalize the floundering Pitts
burgh music scene, and with 100 watts well 
be helping to expose new bands.
According to Garbee, WRCTs range has 
better than doubled and nearly tripled. Lis
teners have called in from points as faraway 
as Wexford, New Kensington, Pittsburgh 
International Airport, and even Butler, 
approximately 30 miles from downtown 
Pittsburgh.

even when I dont ask for requests, insisted 
Red Hot Rosa Silver, WRCT disc jockey. 
In fact, several high school students from 
Natrona Heights visited WRCT after hear

Enck, Garbee, and Iskowitz are most 
excited about what Garbee calls full satura

ing WRCT all the way downtown, 
grinned Enck.
There is still an unfinished step in the 
100-watt process. WRCT is waiting for 
acceptance of the final application, which, 
according to Garbee, should be received 
sometime during the summer. Were cur
rently in program testing, which means we 
are testing our ndhnal programming at 100 
watts. There shouldnt be any problems 
with the FCC accepting our application.
Garbee asks that if anyone is receiving 
interference that can be attributed to WRCT 
that he be contacted immediately at 621 - 
9728.
WRCTs future holds the possibility of an 
expanded library, more storage space, and 
possibly a new studio.
Bishop assures there will be no more

One of Senate's problems is lack of recognition
continued from page 3
tell people that youre on the senate they 
look at you as if its a joke. Its bad enough 
that some people dont even know that we 
have a student senate. You start to wonder 
yourself sometimes. You work your butt off
 hours and hours a week with no pay  
and instead of getting noticed, you get put 
down.
Pane is one of 25 senators that make up 
this years board. This number fluctuates 
with the population of the University. Each 
college of the University is given a number 
of senators in proportion to its size. For 
example, CFA and CIT have large popula
tions so they get more senators. Conse
quently, the colleges of H&SS and AMS are 
small in population so they receive less 
representation.
Within the senate two officers are elcted 
from the ranks of senator, the chairman 
(Pane) and the vice-chairman (Hilary De 
Broff). The president of the senate (Bill 
McCormick) is an ex-officio member (as is 
I V?an Walter and Dean Cox) and has veto
power and speaking priveledges but has no 
vote on the senate floor.
The heart and soul of the senates func
tions are in its four standing committees. 
These also have their own chairpersons. 
These committees diligently carry out the 
activities set forth in the senate consul ution 
and by-laws. This is the senate:
 The Rules Committee: Chairman, Eric 
Rocher. This committee makes sure that the 
constitution and all of its by-laws are fol
lowed. It is in charge of recommending 
changes to the constitution if they are neces
sary and determining the eligibility of cam
pus organizations for student senate 
funding.
 The Finance Committee: Chairman, Fran 
Fitzgerald. This committee allocates the 
money to an organization once they are 
claimed eligible. It handles the $200-$300 
budget taken in from the Students Activities 
Fee. It initiated the student-approved activi
ties fee increase of $5.00 from $25.00 a semes
ter to $30.00.
 The Committee for Academic Affairs: 
Chairperson, Cindy Taylor. This commit
tee is responsible for the handling of 
student-related problems, such as studentteacher conflicts, course-availability, etc. It 
holds a campaign each year called the Aca
demic Response program in which the stu
dent and faculty senates work out problems 
together.
 The General Campus and Information 
Committee: Chairperson, Lisa Bruno. This 
committee is responsible for everything that 
doesnt fall under the first three committees. 
It handles problems and suggestions con
cerning libraries, campus telephones, senate 
public relations, announcement, etc.
Pane emphasized student involvement as 
the key to a successful Student Senate. We 
are the government of this campus; we are 
here to help in whatever way we can. But we 
also need help. Students must realize what 
they can get out of the senate. Maybe if we 
were offered some type of reward for doing 
this people might start to notice what we 
have to offer.
According to Pane, the poor voting i 
have a number of causes. But the biggest 0 
is lack of publicity. For this springs 
tion, Pane offered a resolution to ask 
faculty senate to help publicize the sety 
elections. This resolution called for teach 
to take a minute out of their class-time'

The southern hemisphere would also sus

the brunt of damage due to weather patterns 
that keep nuclear fallout primarily in the 
north.
However, according to TTAPS, two new 
long-term effects, obscuring smoke in the 
troposphere and obscuring dust in the strat
osphere, would create a Nuclear Winter 
that some scientists, including Sagan, say 
could wipe out mankind in both north and 
south.
Following the blast, raging fires would 
create great quantities of pyrotoxins, includ
ing carbon monoxide, vinyl chlorides, 
oxides of nitrogen, ozone, dioxins, and 
furans, killing far more people than the fires 
themselves. These gases would then form a 
toxic smog that moves with the wind and 
weather, killing as it travels. The gas-smog 
would dissipate only after several months, 
killing more in the West than in the East, 
due to greater concentration of modem, syn
thetic building materials in the West.
The dust and smoke from the inidal blast 
and the resulting fires would then rise to 
great heights in the atmosphere, greatly obs

department to broaden its 
cope, offers new course
araes rolutilnaan Staffivriter
MUs History and Language depart11 has broadened its scope and is offering 
lr>troductory course in Japanese next 
'ester. The course idea originated from a 
UP of students who brought it to the 
nil0n of the department. Upon receiving 
request, Dr. Schaefer took the proposal 
he H&SS College Council which readily ,rved it.
^rs Yamada, a native of Japan, will be 
mg the course. She graduated from 
y University located in Tokyo, with a 
m American Studies. She has taughtlishto Japanese students and has used
translating skills in both the States and 
a''; fascinated by language and linguisarna(ia has also studied French, Spanand German.er bas
lentsisic strategy is to find out what the
want to learn and then teach that 
Since the course has never been 
at CMU, Yamada would like to disJapan at all levels; that is, the written
language/communication skills, the artistic 
approach and many other aspects of the 
culture. Currently, she is planning to go 
without a textbook, though newspapers and 
magazine articles might be used.
To start the course, she will give a simple 
lesson on culture, so that understanding of 
the language and customs can be achieved. 
She hopes to end the course with some 
recreational activity  Japanese silk screen
ing. All in all, Yamada is very enthusiastic 
about the class, but she points out that 
theyll need enough students to make it go.
Schaefer emphasized the departments 
willingness to work with students and their 
course requests. He insists that they are open 
to the students needs. He, too, is quite 
excited about this new course and hopes to 
get at least eight to ten interested students.
This twelve unit course which is named 
Elementary Japanese (course number 82- 
171) will meet on Monday, Tuesday, Wed
nesday, and Friday at 9:30 a.m. As Schaefer 
stated, "there is something Japanese for 
everyone.
isphere for up to a year and a half. Such 
darkness would have multiple consequen
ces. First, the usual weather patterns would 
be changed so that fallout radiation and 
obscurment would hit the southern as well 
as the northern hemisphere, contrary to pre
vious belief.
The eco-system would be attacked by the 
darkness also. The lack of sunlight would 
prevent the first link in both aquatic and 
terrestrial eco-systems from carrying on pho
tosynthesis, creating mass starvation.
Soon the darkness would bring tempera
tures plunging downward. Even a very light 
exchange (using .1% of the worlds nuclear 
arsenal or 100 missiles) is predicted to drop 
temperatures 12 to 15 degrees C, while the 
most likely exchange would topple 
temperatures by more than 45 degrees C and 
stay that way for over two years. The impli
cations of such a plunge are numerous. The 
earth would be frozen solid, so most bodies 
would not be buried. Fresh water sources 
would be frozen three feet beneath the sur
face, dehydrating many to death. Many 
plants, especially those growing near the 
equator, would die in the cold. And the 
frozen earth would kill most dormant seeds, 
eliminating the possibility of repopulation 
of vegetation in the near future. Even the 
slightest of conflicts could kill the entire 
Canadian wheat harvest, while the likely 
exchange would make harvest in the north
ern hemisphere impossible for at least two 
years, assuming seed and technology are 
both available. All of this would occur with - 
in the first few days.
Several days later, a combination of 
nuclear fallout, dirt that was picked up by 
the blast and contaminated with radiation, 
and snow would begin to fall. Many survi
vors of the first few days in less populous 
areas would come down with radiation sick
ness. Food and water contamination or 
direct contact could cause sickness. Acute 
damage to bone marrow would cause peo
ple to become more vulnerable to infectious 
disease. Infants in the first two trimesters of 
pregnancy would be subject to mental and 
physical retardation. Animals would be 
even more susceptible to radiation sickness 
due to lack of shelter and greater sensitivity 
to the stresses of nuclear war.,The fallout 
would begin to dissipate in several days, but 
radioactive snow would continue to fall for 
up to a year.
Within weeks, epidemics and pandemics 
would begin to sweep the earths surface. 
The extreme cold, unburied bodies and 
bone marrow damage would con bine with

age due to its near invulnerability to attack.
lack of available medical facilities, an unus
ual resistance of some disease carrying paras
ites, including rats, to radiation and other 
factors to urge on the plague.
After about three months, just as the 
smoke is beginning to clear in the upper 
atmosphere to allow some light in the 
northern hemisphere, the effects of an ozone 
layer 50% shredded by radiation begin to be 
felt. The ozone is a layer in the atmosphere 
that protects us from the suns radiation. So 
just when the radiation is beginning to ease 
up, it gets worse again.
When you add up all the factors involved, 
the total picture looks rather dismal accord
ing to Sagan and friends. All consequences 
taken into consideration, the most likely 
nuclear exchange would in all likelihood 
exterminate mankind in the northern hem
isphere. Canada, the entire United States, 
Europe, the Soviet Union, southeast Asia, 
the Middle East and most of Africa would 
suffer varying stages of darkness, cold, radia
tion, disease and lack of food and water that 
would leave those areas a humanless deso
lation. Light and warmth would return to 
the Eastern and Western worlds within 
about two and a half years, but nobody 
would be there to see it.
In the southern hemisphere, due to the 
changes in weather patterns, although cold 
and darkness would be less severe, massive 
climatic and environmental disruptions

Activists protest senator's support of foreign aid
By CHRISTOPHER JOHNSTON
Special to the Tartan
NEW YORK  We had crammed our
selves into an elevator at the bottom of the 
office building at 1 Pennsylvania Plaza and 
someone hit 16, hoping that the doors 
would close before the security guards 
pulled us out. But the guards had frozen the 
power in elevator bank C, so we were stuck 
there. The activists argued with a security 
official whom I had earlier heard comment 
that the guards should all dress up in 
fatigues and take care of the demonstration 
outside on 34th street. 30 people or so were 
splashing in a circle through the freezing 
March 13 rain to protest U.S. Senator Alp
honse DAmatos support of a Reagan 
Administration proposal that would supply 
$93 million in emergency aid to the military 
regime of El Salvador, and $21 million of 
the same to the counter-revolutionaries who 
are trying to overthrow the Nicaraguan 
government.
The Senate Appropriations committee, of 
which DAmato is a member, originally
added the two aid package amendments to 
a $150 million African drought aid bill. The 
action was considered dirty politics by lib
eral congressmen, who would have had to 
deny aid to destitute Africans in order to stop 
the Central American amendments in Con
gress. After much juggling of the aid from 
bill to bill, the amendments were finally 
passed. Although DAmato aides had 
nothing prepared on the Senators position 
concerning Central America, in all the votes 
concerning the amendments, DAmato 
voted with the President.
The military aid may benefit the guerillas 
fighting the Salvadoran government as well 
as the government itself. Reagan said that El 
Salvador needed emergency military assist
ance because the Government forces were 
running out of ammunition. Amoldo 
Ramos, North American representitive of 
the FDR/FMLN agreed with Reagans 
assessment, but offered this explanation: 
Not only are the Government forces inept, 
they are also corrupt. We (the guerillas) buy 
ammunition from Government forces in the

points of agreement with them. He stopped 
debating after a while, after seeing a repor

While waiting to be arrested, the activists 
chanted, sang songs, pounded on the walls, 
hung political posters from Al DAmatos 
framed awards and pictures, and quibbled 
with the Senators office people over little 
things. The aides wouldnt let a womm go 
to the bathroom, and the activists accused 
the aides of stealing a hat from Seth Tobocman, one of their number.
In the hall outside of DAmatos office, 
City Police gathered. They were more 
relaxed than the building security cops, who 
at the onset of the civil disobedience action 
had their night sticks drawn and ready. 
They joked with each other to pass the time 
before the bust.
Sergeant Richard ODonnell of the Man
hattan South Precinct came into the recep
tion area and announced that everybody 
would be arrested unless they dispersed. The 
activists linked arms. He repeated his offer 
and then announced that they were under

ized that the trip to the paddy wagon would 
be painful and chose to walk instead.
The rest of the people refused to walk, and 
were handcuffed together. John Zirinsky, 
legal representative for the twelve, tried to 
convince the police to carry the people out
one at a time, but without luck.
The first group were dragged down the 
hallway by their handcuffs, which cut into 
their wrists, so they decided to walk after a 
few yards. The second group of five were 
dragged the whole way down the hall to the 
elevators.
Youre injuring me, youre cutting my 
wrists, screamed one activist. Others joined 
in screaming and shouting and the police 
eased up.
The activists were thrown on top of each 
other in the paddy wagon, and the doors 
closed. The wagon pulled away, shaking 
and rocking as the activists pounded on the 
inside walls and shouted their slogans. They 
were jailed, charged with civil trespass, and 
released. If convicted, they will face a maxi

on-Kin Twins spin win in Hanin's opinion
KAR ENCOC
Assistant Entertainment Editor
0ie for a quick riddle ... When are three 
lated people twins? When they are Tom 
.y; Alannah Currie, and Joe Leeway, 
,r known collectively as the Thompson 
Twins. The three, along with 
four others for backup, 
appeared Friday night at the 
Stanley Theatre, and showed the 
cnee of nearly 2900 that they are more 
taining in person than in vinyl, 
mittedly, many bands sound better live 
studio, but few have the stage presence 
tage show which the Twins brought to 
iburgh. All three members seemed to 
enjoy themselves on stage, having 
fun with each other as well as with the 
|ence. Apart from some occasional chophy, the show came straight from the 
s hearts; they moved about on the 
freely and often (thanks to wireless 
t microphones), 
usically, the Twins were flawless. Their 
ing band, featuring a drummer, bassist, 
two keyboard players, reproduced the
o sound the Twins recorded with great 
sion, at the same time giving added 
and life to most numbers. Currie scurup and down on the stage to different 
of percussion, and demonstrated her 
talent on the xylophone. Leeway also 
pered about, but was mostly content 
d a synthesizer or a set of bongos. BaiIccasionally sported a guitar, but most of 
lime he whizzed back and forth across 
|dge of the stage.
ost surprising was the excellent producwhich went into the several ballads of

(1. to r.) Joe Leeway, Tom Bailey, and Alannah Currie gave an absorbing performance at the Stanley on Friday.
the evening. It is rare that a band known 
mostly for its danceable songs is able to effec
tively perform a slow, melodic piece. But 
Sister of Mercy, Storm on the Sea, and 
their present hit Hold Me Now, were all 
startlingly well done. Each began with Bai
ley on an electric piano playing chords 
which slowly evolved into the song to be 
performed. Baileys voice was perfect; he hit 
every note on the head, and filled each song 
with emotion. Also well done were the back
ing vocals of Leeway, who was able to hit all 
of his falsetto notes without seeming to have 
difficulty.
Highlights included their slew of hits
such as In the Name of Love and Lies, 
during which the band members could not 
stop moving about. Also mentionable were 
the greatly appreciated Doctor! Doctor!, 
and You Take Me Up which began with a 
harmonica duet between Bailey and Lee
way, and was illustrated with projected 
shadows of hard laborers in different work
ing positions. Another highlight was the 
performance of We Are Detective which 
featured a spy-like figure reading a news
paper on stage, and more eerie projected 
shadows.
The audience so greatly appreciated the 
Twins, that they were brought back for two
encores, ending the show with a repeat of 
Doctor! Doctor!. During this reprise, Bai
ley seemed to sing about the audience rather 
than some unknown lover when he sang:
I saw you there
Just standing there
And I thought I was only dreaming
you.
But Bailey wasnt really dreaming.The love 
he felt from his fans was real. The perfor
mance the Twins gave in return was real as 
well. In the present invasion of British 
dance-oriented music, there is without a 
doubt, no twin for the Thompson Twins.
Aqua Madonnas to perform 
in College of Fine Arts
pnoio uy v^arolyn Speranza.
[ Aqua Madonnas are: Marge Judge (Back); Diane Schweitzer, Kristen Bjaastad, 
Kuharic, Janet Metzger (Middle, left to right); and Allison Hunter (Front)
By MARK LEVINE
Tartan Entertainment Editor
The Aqua Madonnas are going to school. 
Their performance art piece School Play 
(with Mr. Professor), will be performed on 
Wednesday, April 25 at 11:30 p.m. in front of 
the Dean of Fine Arts office.
In short, the Madonnas are at it again. If 
you havent ever seen the Aqua Madonnas 
perform, dont miss this concert, it may be 
the last live performance for a while. The 
Aqua Madonnas may be going to school in 
performance, but in real life theyre all 
graduating.
Five of the Madonnas are Art majors: 
Kristen Bjaastad, Allison Hunter, Marge 
Judge, Katie Kuharic and Janet Metzger. 
The other Madonna, Diane Schweitzer, is a 
drama major.
After getting their chance to perform on 
WRCT, for which they give thanks to Bob 
Konuch, they decided on a new and interest
ing concept  a non-group, one that 
wouldnt perform. Theyd put up signs,
make appearances, but never do anything. 
Fortunately, their Tuesday radio appearan
ces brought them enough recognition that 
they would be forced to sing.
So now they do ... well, what they do. Its 
overdone, overblown, overwrought silli
ness. They sing songs from such diverse 
resources as The Mickey Mouse Club," 
Doris Day and Shirley Temple records. 
They do a very straight-faced performance 
of Kitsch, watered-down entertainment 
that is a cross between hilarious and maca
bre. You have to see it to believe it.
The Aqua Madonnas (they got their 
name from Dean of Fine Arts Akram 
Midani) have since performed at bars, par
ties, the Mattress Factory, the IT art festival, 
and most recently at Spring Carnival. They

January 1963, at age 16, when Leonard 
Bernstein presented him to CBS viewers as a 
soloist for a New York Philharmonic 
Young Peoples Concert. His rendition of 
Liszts E-Flat Piano Concerto was so 
impressive that Bernstein called him three 
weeks later to act as a substitute for ailing 
symphony pianist Glenn Gould. The teen
age Watts received a standing ovation from 
audience and orchestra members alike, 
reported by wire services throughout the 
world.
Watts played at a Presidential Inaugural 
Concert and has performed for numerous 
other heads of state, as well, including the 
King, Queen,and Queen Mother of Greece, 
Archbishop Makarios and King Juan Car
los of Spain and Queen Sophia. In 1976

Vanities explores three girls' lives
The play Vanities, by Jack Heifner, fol
lows the lives of three young women from 
high school in the early 60s, through col
lege, and into middle age in the 70s. In the 
course of the play, each of the characters 
comes to face the emptiness and shallowness 
of their lives, and each deals with them in 
different ways.
The Scotch n Soda production stars Cla
rissa Narotzky, Christine Mosier, and Anne 
Svedberg, all freshmen at CMU. Narotzky 
also directs the play, a task made easier by 
the fact that Vanities has only three charac
ters, in three scenes, and a very sparse set.
The play will run this Sunday and Mon
day, April 29 and 30, at 8 pm in the Wherrett
Room in Skibo. Tickets will be sold at the 
door before each performance, in the lobby 
of Baker Hall each afternoon, and the lobby
of Morewood Gardens each evening, ft. 
vations may be made by calling the fw

Washout:
gy DUANE GALBI
fartan Staffwriter
Last Saturday, as the rain was making life 
miserable for those on the Midway, down 
l^low on the CMU track, the track team was 
making life even more miserable for John 
Carroll University and Thiel College as the 
team added two impressive wins to their
record.
The expected duel against John Carroll 
was a washout. John Carroll, after the first 
of three rain delays, decided it wasnt worth 
getting their shirts all muddy. They packed 
up and headed home. As it turned out, 
though, Thiel should have followed John 
rrolls lead. They wouldnt have done 
much worse. In the field events Thiel was 
ble to score a few points; however, the Tarstill had their share of victories Jeff 
in was a double winner as he captured 
th the shot and discus, and Jim Rogers 
leaped 43 feet 10 inches to first place with a 
ault of 13 feet that was even higher than his 
lear-weather performance the week before. 
When it was time for the Tartan cinderen to perform, Thiel was almost no where 
be seen, and only one runner from Thiel 
dually scored any points in the individual 
vents. Sanford Rivers, who works in the 
dmissions office, who must have the toughJohn Carroll forfeits after three rain delays, 
while Thiel gets ripped by CMU distance corps
Itans
est right ear in Pittsburgh, made a quick 
switch from being the offidal buggy starter 
Friday and Saturday to start the track races 
for the Tartans.
In the mile, though, the outcome was 
assured even before the gun was fired, for 
Thiel failed to field any competitors in the 
event. Mike Short, Chris Shaffer and Frank 
Matousek along with freshmen Curt Meuse 
and Tom Felmley all finished in a virtual ue 
for first place in 5:00. Art Muzik won the 880 
in 2:04 and Gary Marchionna broke the rib
bon in the 120 intermediate hurdles in 16.5 
seconds as the Tartans began to run away 
with the meet. Bob Krouse was a double 
winner for the Tartans as he captured both 
his specialities, the 440 and the 440 interme
diate hurdles.
In the 220, Rob DiGioia got off to a good 
start and was able to hold off the Thiel 
runner who had beaten him in the 100, ther
eby adding another first to the Tartans col
lection. In one of the last events of the day 
Bob Dusch splashed home to a gutsy first 
place finish over his fellow teammates. 
Dusch made his presence felt early as he took 
the lead and pulled away from the rest of the 
field. His time of 15:28 was amazing consid
ering the conditions of the track.

eckley shoots for 100th consecutive win
uy BRUCE GERSON
to the Tartan 
Gary Meckley, head cross-country and 
ack and field coach at CMU, will be shoot
ing for his 99th, 100th, and 101st consecutive 
pual meet victories at 1 p. m., Saturday, 
Vpril 28, when his Tartans host Hiram Cole, Case Reserve University, and Robert 
lorris College.
Meckley, in his 17th year at CMU, has led 
he Tartans to 54 straight dual meet victories 
cross-country and 44 consecutive dual 
leet wins in track and field. The last time 
-MU lost on the cross-country course was 
In 1979 to Bethany College, and its been
seven years since the Tartans fell in track
and field on April 20, 1977 at Case Reserve. 
A win over Hiram, Case Reserve, and 
Robert Morris Saturday will give Meckley 
101 dual meets in a row without a loss.
Meckley, a native of Kane, PA, has posted 
a 166-21 cross-country record and a 104-24 
track slate, making his combined mark 270- 
45 for a winning percentage of .857.
Under Meckley the Tartans have not only 
dominated the PAC, they have also been 
well represented in NCAA regional and 
national championship events.
CMU has won five PAC cross-country
championships in the past six years (1978, 
80, 81, 82, 83), five straight PAC track and 
field titles and six consecutive PAC relay 
championships. The Tartans have quali
fied for the national cross-country meet 
every year since 1974 and have had a 
nadonal qualifier in track and field annu
ally since 1977. CMU captured the NCAA 
Eastern Cross-Country championship in 
1980, finished second in 1981 and 1982 and 
fourth in 1983. At the national cross
country meet the Tartans placed 12th in 
1980, sixth in 1981, 18th in 1982, and 12th in
1983. Among private institutions participat
ing in cross-country CMU has ranked in the 
top five since 1980.
Meckley has produced 62 conference 
champions, 26 All-East selections, 54 
national qualifiers and eight AllAmericans.
A graduate of Kane High School, Meck
ley won the state pole vault championship 
as a senior with a record vault of 13 feet 3 
inches. He enrolled at the University of 
Pittsburgh on a track scholarship in 1960, 
and in his first year was ranked third among 
freshman pole valuters by The Track and 
Field News. As a sophomore he placed 
fourth in the prestigious IC4A Indoor 
Championships and was named to the AllEast team.
Meckley earned a bachelors degree in cor
rective therapy and physical education at 
Pitt in 1964, and three years later received a 
masters degree.
Meckley began coaching at CMU in 1967 
after serving as an assistant track and cross
country coach at Pitt from 1965-1967. Since 
1978 he has also been assistant athletic direc
tor at CMU.
3kt-Golf not an easy sport

-, 
photo by Erik Horn
 distance corps has always been a strength of Gary Meckleys teams.
By SCOTT BOZIC
Tartan Assistant Sports Editor
We all know that golf is an easy sport. 
Just go out and play 18 holes whenever the 
weathei is nice, golf for free, and every now 
and then play with some other people in 
tournament or a match. Its not a real sport 
like football or basketball, right?
Wrong.
To be on a golf team requires lots of work, 
time, and dedication to the sport. Here at 
CMU there are 14 such individuals who are 
willing to work, sacrifice the time and dedi
cate themselves to the sport of golf.
They practice Tuesdays and Thursdays 
rain or shine at Longview, a 20 minute ride 
from CMU. Between driving to and from 
the course and playing 18 holes of golf, prac
tices usually last five hours or more.
The teams schedule consists mainly of 
tournaments, with dual and triangular 
meets also. The highlight of our year is the 
PAC championship, which is a tourna
ment, so we set up a tournament schedule to 
condition the kids for tournament play, is 
how Coach Don Poluszek explains it. He 
also notes the practically of tournaments 
versus dual meets: If were going to travel 
75-100 miles we dont just want to play one 
team. With tournaments we get more expo
sure and more experience playing more 
than one team.
The team began practicing indoors in 
early March, and began its regular season of 
play with the Spiedel Tournament on April 
11. Thus far the team has competed against 
27 teams in three tournaments and the only 
division III team to beat it was Allegheny, 
last years Division III national champions.
CMU won the Spiedel and Hiram invita
tional tournaments with Paul Bangor and 
Pete Bombik as medalists, respectively. In 
the Slippery^ Rock Invitational, a tourna
ment comprised mainly of Division II and
I-AA schools, CMU finished in the top half 
of the 16 teams competing.
Six players represent the team in a match 
or tournament. The six who compete in any 
given match are the ones with the best six 
scores in the practice round immediately 
preceding the match. For the PAC tourna
ment, Poluszek averages all the players 
scores from practices, tournaments and 
matches and takes the top six averages.
Theres usually competition on the team 
for the fifth and sixth spots, which gets eve
ryone on the team out there practicing. This 
competition helps the team, said Poluszek. 
He also stressed the teams ability and wil
lingness to work."

Tigers' pitching to launch Detroit in AL East
By CHRISTOPHER D. LEWIS
Tartan Sports Editor
The American League has a major league 
and a minor league. The Eastern Division 
has five bonafide contenders. Any of them 
could win the World Series. The Western 
Division has the Chicago White 
Sox and the Chicago White Sox. 
The rest of the division is made 
up of weak teams, none with 
more than two or three quality players.
This is the AL, where East meets West 
and wins, except when the 1984 playoffs 
rolls around.
And now, without further adieu, the 1984 
American League scouting reports, in the 
predicted order of finish:
Detroit Tigers  Well, its two weeks into 
the season, and the Tigers are 9-0, so its easy 
to pick them to finish first. They already 
have a six-game lead over the Orioles. I 
really did write these down before the sea
son. Really.
Starting pitchers make this division spe
cial, and make this team special. Jack Morris 
(20-13, 3.34 ERA) has already pitched a no
hitter this year. Dan Petry (19-11, 3.92) was a 
stopper for the Tigers as well. The Bengals 
re-signed free agent Milt Wilcox (11-10,3.97) 
and have Juan Berenguer (9-5, 3.14) and 
Dave Rozema (8-3, 3.43). The Tigers picked 
up lefty Willie Hernandez (8-4, 3.29, 8 saves)
Correction
The Tartan sports department sends its 
apologies to SDC and CIA. The SDC 
women finished in fourth place with a time 
of 3:00.5, contrary to last weeks report. 
CIAs Black Magic rolled just five windows, 
not the nine we reported last week. We apol
ogize for these errors, for mistakes about 
buggy are large mistakes indeed.
from Philadelphia to shore up a bullpen 
that already had Aurelio Lopez (9-8, 2.81, 18 
saves) and Doug Bair (7-3, 3.88, 4 saves).
The Tigers lost a good, young outfielder 
in Glenn Wilson (11 HR, 65 RBI, .268 B.A.) 
and a versatile one in John Wockenfuss 
(9, 49, .269) in orderto get Hernandez, but 
they have plenty of talent to fill in the holes.
The reason I believe the Tigers will win is 
basic: I believe a team should be built up the 
middle; defensively, offensively, and on the 
mound. The Tigers are stronger up the mid
dle than any team in baseball. Lance Parrish 
(27, 114, .269) is the best catcher, all around, 
in baseball Lou Whitaker (12,72,.320) and 
Alan Trammell (14, 66, .319) comprise die 
best double play combination anywhere. 
Chet Lemon (24, 69, .255) is no weakness in 
centerfield.
The keys to this team are rightfield and 
third base. The Tigers picked up two solid 
first basemen from the Giants, Darrell Evans 
(30, 82, .277) and Dave Bergman (6,24, .286). 
Evans also may play third. Barbara Garbey 
(14, 59, .321 at AAA Evansville), the only 
Cuban refugee to make the majors, will be 
given a shot at third base. Kirk Gibson (15, 
51 .227) will play right and try and fulfill his' 
"Mr. Potential" image. Larry Herndon (20, 
92, .302) will be in left following a quiet but 
great year.
If Gibson and a third baseman come 
through, this Tiger team could run away 
with the division. But dont count on 
anyone running away with this division.
Baltimore Orioles  The World Series 
Champs are off to a 4-10 start. Dont worry, 
these pitchers are too good to keep losing.
The Orioles had the best starting staff in 
ihe division at the beginning of last year. 
Then Jim Palmer (5-4,4.23) and Mike Flan
agan (12-4, 3.30) got injured, and they 
brought up this kid named Mike Boddicker.
So Boddicker goes 16-8 and leads the league 
with a 2.77 ERA, then wins two key games 
in the playoffs, then wins rookie pitcher-ofthe-year. Scott McGregor (18-7, 3.18) had 
another Cy Young type year. Storm Davis 
(13-7, 3.59) is a good young pitcher. The 
bullpen is led by Tippy Martinez (9-3, 2.35, 
21 saves) and Sammy Stewart (9-4, 3.62, 7 
saves).
Now, ladies and gentlemen, the terrific 
twosome. Eddie Murray (33, 111, .306); awe
some power, hits for average, gold glove 
winner. Cal Ripken, Jr. (27, 102, .318); 
Ripken won the Most Valuable Player in 
the American League last year. Dont look 
for another shortstop on Baltimore, Ripken 
played every inning of every game last year, 
an incredible feat.
Add to these players incredible depth, platooning at every position except the two 
stars, second base and designated hitter (Ken 
Singleton: 18, 84, .276). You have a winning 
ballclub.
If everyone pitches as they are able to 
pitch, watch out. If not, this could be just an 
ordinary team. I think the Tigers may be 
better.
Toronto Blue Jays-----A fun team to
watch. The scary part is that they are so 
young. Pitcher Dave Stieb (17-12, 3.04) is 
just 26. Centerfielder Lloyd Moseby (18, 81, 
.351) is only 24. First baseman Willie 
Upshaw (27, 104, .306) will be 27 this wee
kend. A relative veteran. 24-year-old Jesse 
Barfield hit 27 homers in 377 at bats. He 
would have hit 40 for a full season. All-star 
second baseman Damaso Garcia (3,38, 307) 
is just 27.
But they are a good team already. Stieb, 
Jim Clancy (15-11, 3.91) and Luis Leal (13- 
12,4.21) make up the nucleus of a good staff, 
which now includes Dennis Lamp (7-7, 
3.71, 15 saves with the White Sox). The Jays
also picked up Willie Aikens (23, 72, .302) to 
DH with Cliff Johnson (22,76, .265), as soon 
as Aikens comes off his drug suspension 
Solid management and patience has 
brought this team a long way, and Bobby 
Cox has done a great job nursing these kids 
With a good year from the bullpen and 
several platoon players, this team could take 
the title.
New York Yankees  Im from New 
York. I see this team play more than any 
other. And they baffle me. Position by posi
tion they might be the best in all of baseball 
But, as usual, that wont be enough.
If you remember, one of the the Blue Jays' 
strengths which I listed was solid manage
ment. This is where the Yankees are very 
weak. George The Panic Artist Steinbrenner will be sure that the Yanks are fighting, arguing, and team dissention is 
running rampant.continued on page 15

Jays could fly high; pitching depth hurts N.Y.
ntinued from page 14
Xhe Yankees have the stars, but they are 
upid. Plain dumb. Management seems to 
in the Twilight Zone. For your approval: 
Dave Righetu (14-8, 3.44 and a no-hitter), 
his man pitches well all year as a starting 
tcher. So Steinbrenner moves him to the 
allpen in order to fill the hole left by the 
eparture of Goose Gossage. So now there is 
hole in a not very deep starting rotation. 
Tim Foli. Why? The Yankees had Andre 
obertson (1, 22, .248), Roy Smalley (18,62, 
75), Toby Harrah (9, 53, .266 with Clevend), Bobby Meacham (9, 60, .262 with 
Columbus), and Keith Smith (8, 38, 
58 with Nashville). Robertson, who has a 
nooth glove, was injured in a tragic acci
dent last year and his shoulder was a ques
tion mark coming in to this season. So the 
Yanks only had four shortstops. Oh no, we 
better pick up another one. So Steinbrenner 
got Foli (2, 29, .252 with the Angels), and 
then Harrah from Cleveland. If Meacham 
and Smith are such great prospects, why not 
give them a shot. Better yet, pick up a 34-year 
old from California and when Robertson 
comes back you can bench Foli so he too can 
be unhappy. The worst part is that they 
traded reliable reliever George Frazier for 
Harrah and relief pitching prospect Curt 
Kaufman for Foli to further open the gash 
in their bullpen. Stupid.
Two good moves. Phil Niekro (11-10,3.97 
with Adanta) was signed to be the number

Cai Ripken, Jr. (r.) and Eddie Murray of the Baltimore Orioles.
two starter, and Mike Armstrong (10-7, 3.86,
3 saves with Kansas City) was acquired to 
help the porous pen. Niekro has pitched 
well, but Armstrong has been injured, leav
ing a spot open for righthander Jose Rijo 
(15-5,1.68 with Ft. Lauderdale in A ball, 3-2, 
2.68 at AA Nashville). Rijo is just 18, as is 
outfielder Stan Javier, who was bom Sep
tember 1, 1965, becoming the first major 
leaguer younger than me. Scary.
So now the Yankees have signed Oscar 
Gamble. OK, Ill stop. But you get the pic
ture. Where will Don Mattingly play? No 
where, yet. But Mattingly (4, 32, .283) will 
play.
Dave Winfield (32,116, .283), Ken Griffey 
(11, 46, .306), Willie Randolph (2, 38, .279), 
Butch Wynegar(6, 42, .296), and Ron 
Guidry(21-9,3.42) will not make this team a 
winner. Steve Kemp(12, 49, .241), Don Baylor(21,85, .303), and Ray Fontenot(8-2,3.33) 
might, if they can come through with a 
bang.
Just be glad I didnt go off on Omar 
Moreno.
Milwaukee Brewers  Starting pitching 
again is the key. Injuries have taken their 
toll, as has age. Don Sutton (8-13, 4.08) is 39, 
Mike Caldwell (12-11, 4.53) is 35. Moose 
Haas (13-3, 3.27) had a great year, but got 
hurt. Pete Vuckovich (0-2,4.91) pitched just 
14 innings. Bob McClure (9-9,4.50) was also 
injured. Rookies Bob (no, not the famous 
one) Gibson, Tom Candiotti, and Jaime 
Cocanower, who pitched well, have yet to 
prove themselves.
Pete Ladd (3-4,2.55,25 saves) pitched well 
in relief, and Rollie Fingers has returned 
from an injured elbow. Along with Tom 
Tellman (9-4, 2.80, 8 saves), the three make 
up a very strong bullpen.
The starting lineup is awesome, led by 
first baseman Cecil Cooper (30, 126, .307),
shortstop Robin Yount (17, 80, .308), and 
DH Ted Simmons (13,108, .308). Paul Molitor must come back strong from an injury to 
his elbow. He can hit but he cant throw. 
Roolde Randy Ready (1, 6, .405 in a brief
1983 stint) will fill in until Molitor returns.
Jim Gantner (11, 74, .282) is probably the 
most underrated second baseman in base
ball. Charlie Moore (2, 49, .284) and Ben 
Ogilvie (13, 66, .280) will be tested by Dion 
James (8, 68, .336 at AAA Vancouver) and 
Mark Brouhard (7, 23, .276) in the outfield.
Catcher Jim Sundberg (2, 28, .201) was 
acquired after a very poor year in Texas to 
pick up the slack behind the plate. But the 
lack of pitching will kill this team, no mat
ter how good new manager Rene Lachemann is.
Boston Red Sox  Worst pitching in the 
division, and they have traded away John 
Tudor, their best pitcher, for another power 
hitting outfielder, Mike Easier (10, 54, .307 
with Pittsburgh). The Sox already had Jim 
Rice (39, 126, .305), Tony Armas (36, 107, 
.218), and Dwight Evans (22, 58, .238). They 
have the hitters, not the pitchers. This 
almost looks like a Steinbrennerian move, 
although Haywood Sullivan is probably 
just as bad. Bob Ojeda (12-7, 4.04) is not an 
ace starter. Its too bad Bob Stanley (8-10, 
2.85, 33 saves) cant be cloned.
The Sox are glad to have Wade Boggs (5, 
74, .361), the greatest pure hitter in the game 
today, bar none. They hope Jackie Gutierrez 
can take over at shortstop to replace the 
inept Glenn Hoffman (4, 41, .260).
The key to this team is pitching, and that 
is why this team might finish sixth, if they 
beat out the Indians.
Cleveland Indians  The team has a little 
pitching, a little offense, a litde defense, and 
a lot of speed. But speed doesnt win divcontinued on page 16

Indian success can't continue on speed alone
continued from page 15
isions by itself.
Neal Heaton (11-7, 4.16, 7 saves) is a good 
young pitcher. Rick Sutcliffe (17-11, 4.29) is 
solid. But thats about it, unless Bert Blyleven (7-10, 3.91) can come back from an 
injury.
The Indians have a lot of guys who can 
get on base, but only one, Andre Thornton 
(17, 77, .281), who can drive them in. So the 
Indians moved potential RBI-man Pat 
Tabler (6, 65, .291) to first base and benched 
on-base man Mike Hargrove (3, 57, .286). 
Then the Indians got Brook Jacoby (25,100, 
.315 at AAA Richmond) from the Braves to 
help.
Other newcomers include Tony Bemazard (2, 26, .262) and Otis Nixon (0, 41, .291 
at AAA Columbus), who will both step into 
starting roles. The Indians have a good 
young club, including potential superstar 
Julio Franco (8, 80, .273) at shortstop. But 
they play in the AL East. In any other div
ision, the Indians would be contenders. 
With two years experience, another power 
hitter and a relief pitcher, the Indians will be 
contenders.
Western Division:
Chicago White Sox  World Series time 
for the White Sox. Why not? They are going 
to coast to their division title while the East
ern champs will struggle until the final
game.
The Chisox have the best starting rotation 
in baseball. Cy Young Award winner 
LaMarr Hoyt (24-10, 3.66) is, in my estima
tion, the second or third best pitcher on the 
Sox. Both Richard Dotson (22-7, 3.23) and 
Floyd Bannister (16-10, 3.35) have better 
stuff. Now add to that Britt Bums (10-11, 
3.58) and you have a great staff. Now who is 
the fifth guy. Some old stiff named Tom 
Seaver (9-14, 3.55 with the Mets). Now you 
have the best staff.
Now, do you want to be scared. This team 
with the great pitchers led the league in runs 
last year. They can hit, too. Carlton Fisk had 
86 RBI. That was fourth on the team!
Ron Kittle (35, 100, .254) would have had 
more RBIs if Greg Luzinski (32, 95, .255) 
had knocked in fewer runs ahead of him. 
Luzinski would have knocked in more if 
Harold Baines (20, 99, .280) had knocked in 
fewer in front of him. Who would have 
knocked in more if Fisk, well, you get the 
picture.
Leadoff man Rudy Law gets on base, and 
Julio Cruz does too. The White Sox had the 
second best base stealing percentage in base
ball. Law (3,34, .283) stole 77 bases and Cruz 
(3, 52, .252) had 57.
They are not a great fielding team. They
are OK, but so what. Add to this already 
awesome lineup Tom Paciorek (9, 63, .307) 
and Greg WTalker (10, 55, .270) and you have 
a first base platoon of 19 homers and 118 
RBI.
If you have lots of money, or a ranch, bet 
the Chisox in the West.
Texas Rangers  A good, young team 
that led the American League in ERA last 
year. So they did what a good team should 
do to improve, and traded from their 
strength. John Butcher and Mike Smithson 
were traded to the Twins for power hitter 
Gary Ward (19, 88, .278).
That will complete an outfield that could 
compete with anyone. Centerfielder George 
Wright (18, 80, .276) is one of the best young 
players in the league, Leftfielder Billy Sam
ple (12, 57, .274, 44 SB) is the teams leadoff 
hitter. Larry Parrish (26, 88, .282) will now 
be the regular DH.
Charlie Hough (15-13, 3.18) leads a good 
pitching staff, but not good enough. Dave 
Stewart (5-2, 2.14 with Texas, 5-2, 2.96 with 
L. A.) is also tough, but this team is not good 
enough up the middle. They are weak at 
catcher, where Ned Yost (6, 28, .244) arrives 
from Milwaukee, and also weak at second 
and short. Wayne Tolleson (3, 20, .260, 33 
SB) is mediocre at best,and Curtis Wilkerson 
is a rookie at short.

Kansas City Royals - We all know the| 
story. Great team turns to drugs and falls 
apart. Last years starting outfield is gone I 
although suspended Willie Wilson y 
return. The other starters are rookies.
The phenomenal George Brett (25,

up Steve Balboni, who hit 32 homers with] 
Columbus and the Yankees last year.
Don Slaught (0, 28, .318) is a singles hit! 
ting catcher. You dont find too many sin-1 
gles hitting catchers.There is a good reasi 
for that.
Frank White is the number three hitte 
until Brett returns. A .260 hitter with 
power is not a good number three hitter.
Reliever Dan Quisenberry (45 saves)  
put this team in fourth place.

Minnesota Twins - Not a bad team. Not a

itchingThey are very young. Kent Hrbek 
[6 84, .297) is tough. Tim Teufel (27, 100, 323 with Toledo) is a good young prospect. 
John Butcher (6-6, 3.51) and Mike Smith~n (10-14, 2.91) will help on the mound, 
ut they gave up their number one out
sider in Gary Ward. Ken Schrom (15-8, 
.71) had a great year.
Tom Brunansky (28, 82, .227) hits home 
ns, as does Gary Gaetti (21, 78, .245). 
ickey Hatcher hit .317 last year..
No pitching will hurt this team. They are 
Iso very boring to watch.
California Angels - They could be good 
nough to finish second.But their starting 
itching is the worst in the American
-ague.
Rod Carew (2, 44, .339) is a great hitter. So 
s Fred Lynn (22,74, .274), as is Doug DeCins (18, 65, .281).
Rookie Gary Pettis is supposedly the
starting centerfielder. He is a speedy young 
hitter who will help.
Reggie Jackson (14, 49, .194) had a horri
ble year. He must return to form in order for 
the Angels to do anything.
Watch rookie shortstop Dick Schofield 
(16, 94,.284). He could be another great 
young star.
Seattle Mariners - Better, but still pitiful. 
And they have benched last years team 
MVP Pat Putnam (19, 67, .269) inorder to 
play Ken Phelps, who hit well in AAA last 
year (24,82, .341). Mistake.
Good young arms are led by Matt Young 
(11-15, 3.27) and Jim Beattie (10-15, 3.84). 
This is the only strength of this team.
Gorman Thomas (22 homers) is a leftfielder who cant throw. Barry Bonnell (10, 
54, .318) will help.
There isnt much more to say.
Outlook: White Sox will defeat the Tigers 
because of their pitching and power, and 
then will defeat the Padres in the World 
Series.
Then again, I could be wrong.

Outstanding catcher Lance Parrish will lead the Tigers bid in 84.
As boys, they made a pact to share their fortunes, their loves, their lives. 
As men, they shared a dream to rise from poverty to power. 
Forging an empire built on greed, violence and betrayal, their dream

Editorial._______________________
Student Senate aims for new productivity
Students have complained for years that Stu
dent Senate doesnt do anything. Look for that 
to change.
Since elections several weeks ago, a new 
sense of cooperation and communication has 
begun to grow in Senate. When things began 
shifting direction, some quarreling took place 
within Senate. But such in-fighting is only to 
be expected when an organization shifts from 
the traditional path, and bickering seems to 
have been quelled.
General Campus and Information, a com
mittee some Senators considered eliminating 
only a semester ago, is now lining up numer
ous projects with the aim of better representing 
students through communication. Already
chairman Lisa Bruno has made great strides in 
improving relations between Senate and other 
campus organizations.
Academic Affairs, under the direction of 
Cindy Taylor, has also gotten into the com
munication business. Taylors academic 
response program has already drawn both 
positive and negative feedback from students 
about teachers and channelled it to department 
heads, administrators, and the teaching center.
But perhaps most encouraging is the leader
ship and initiative demonstrated by Student 
Government President Bill McCormick. 
McCormick, in an attempt to focus Senates 
goals for precise action, has introduced the
idea of creating a Steering Committee. Such a i 
committee would not give Senate any greater 
power but would create more effective poliq 
by eliminating factionated fragmentation.
In order to better implement policy, McCor | 
mick would have senators trained in leadership, group theory and communication with| 
administration.
However, Senate can hardly represent stu l 
dents without input. Students wishing to voice! 
an opinion can find senators in the Senate 
office in Skibo 59 during various hours (see ad 
on page 7) or can attend regular Senate meet
ings Tuesday nights at 7 p.m. McCormicks 
Steering Committee will be discussed at I 
tonights meeting in the Wherrett Room.
New student government president writesFaculty course evaluations worth your time
By Bill McCormick
Its that time of year again.
No, I dont mean Spring Carnival or the 
push that happens a few weeks before finals. 
Its time to fill out the Faculty Course EvaI luations (FCE).
Big deal, you say. Well, it is. 
f' Its a chance for you to write you
views on paper, for the record, 
and have your anonymous opinions seen by 
administrators, faculty, and your fellow stu
dents. Many people complain about their 
academic environment. Heres a chance for 
your complaints to be heard.
You dont like the FCE? Well, there are 
many other options for you to make your 
complaint known. First, try your professor. 
Believe it or not, professors would like to 
hear from you. Thats what they invented 
office hours for. Afraid of your grade? Slip a 
note under his door. If your prof doesnt
listen, go to your department head.
There are ways that you can communi
cate your concerns through students as well. 
Every department has a SAC (Student Advi
sory Council) which is a liaisonbetween you 
and your department. Find out who your 
SAC representatives are and talk to them.
Student Senate has an entire committee 
devoted exclusively to Academic Affairs. 
Just drop a note in the Academic Affairs 
mailbox (behind the Skibo Info Desk) or get 
in touch with Cindy Taylor. I guarantee 
that your views will be heard and passed 
along to someone who will act on them.
Finally, there is a university creation 
called the Teaching Center headed by a very 
responsive gentleman named Ted Fenton. 
The Teaching Center (BH/PH 228A, 
x2896) is a great place to register your 
comments.
Whats the point?
1)There are many ways for you to com
municate your views to people who will 
listen and act.
2)Nothing will change without your 
effort.
P.S. To be really effective, give a compli
ment along with your criticism. If no critifeedback encourages good performance.
I am in the Senate office (Skibo 59) every I 
Monday and Thursday from 6:30 to 
p.m. If you have an idea, complaint, compii-1 
ment, or question, stop by or leave a note in | 
my mailbox behind the Skibo Desk.
Bill McCormick is president of Studenti 
Senate and will be writing a weekly column I

Abolish monopolyReturn Jrwhey to free market
By Dan Tobias
In my last column, I commented on our 
governments debasement of our money. At 
the end of the column I stated that I would 
bring up alternative monetary systems this 
p week. Thus, I will now explore 
| such systems.
Basically, the most important 
step is abolish the governments 
monopoly on issuing money. Government 
fiat money inevitably leads to inflation. 
While it is true that at present inflation is 
not a major problem, this situation is likely 
to be temporary. Even now, inflation still 
continues, although at a lower rate than a 
couple of years ago, and it will no doubt 
start escalating again soon, given the 
increasing government deficits.
After all, with taxation at back-breaking 
levels already, the public will not tolerate 
very many tax increases. Meanwhile, special 
interest groups iowl at the slightest cuts in 
their pet programs. Thus, the government 
tends to print more money to pay its debts.
Therefore, I propose returning the issu
ing erf money to the free market, where it 
originated. Anybody should have the right 
to mint coins and issue banknotes, but 
nobody should be forced to accept any par
ticular form of money. Under such a system 
it is likely the public will refuse to accept any 
money that is not backed by some tangible 
good, such as gold or silver, which can be 
claimed on demand by presenting the bill.
If somebcxly is dishonest and issues bills 
without backing them with a sufficient 
quantity of valuables, then people will even
tually call his bluff by attempting to 
red ptiin tb' H!!s. When the issuer is unable
to redeem them, the bills would lose their 
value. Thus, the workings of the free market 
would eliminate such unscrupulous issuers 
of money relatively quickly. Unfortu
nately, some people would come out as los
ers, being caught holding worthless 
banknotes when the issuer went bankrupt. 
But then why shouldnt the principle of 
caveat emptor (Let the buyer beware) apply 
to money as much as any other good? If you 
accept money issued by some fly-by-night 
operator, you are taking a risk, just like 
when you invest in a speculative stock.
Besides, under the present system every - 
bodys dollars are gradually losing their 
value; they are worth less than one-tenth of 
what they were worth in 1940. It is unlikely 
that a company issuing money in the free 
market would be able to survive very long if 
it did even a small fraction of the unscrupu
lous things our government has. And even 
when a particular brand of currency col
lapses, it would not ruin the entire economy 
of the USA, as would happen if the dollar 
were to collapse. People holding other 
forms of money would be safe.
What would be likely to remain, after an 
initial unsettled period in which the market 
takes shape, would be a few reputable blue 
chip issuers of money, which people regard 
as the standard. They would probably be 
denominated in a standard manner to facili
tate pricing; perhaps in terms of ounces of 
gold or silver. There would also be many 
private mints issuing gold or silver coins 
which can circulate directly. (There are 
already some such mints. I presently have a 
one-ounce silver coin issued by a company

Once again I was insufficiently motivated 
to devote an entire column to a single topic. 
Hence, the scattered musings of a slightly 
deranged mind.
 One can only marvel at the 
sheer audacity of Ronald Rea
gan and his cronies. Apparently 
their idea of a bipartisan foreign 
policy consists of Ronnie and the boys call 
-ing the shots while Congress remains deaf, 
dumb, and blind. Actually, given the extent 
to which this Administration feels unen
cumbered by ethical or legal niceties, its 
rather amazing they havent found more 
ways of simply bypassing Congress. If 
nothing else, at least I can take pleasure, as 
so many others have, from the development 
of a genuinely bipartisan foreign policy con
sensus in Congress. From Ted Kennedy to 
Barry Goldwater, liberals and conservatives, 
Democrats and Republicans, have closed 
ranks in telling our imperious leader to stuff 
it.
 Im sick and tired of watching Walter 
Mondale and Gary Hart, not to mention 
other Democratic leaders, handle Jesse Jack
son with kid gloves. If any white candidate 
refused to disassociate himself from a sup
porter who admired Hitler and got off on 
making death threats, that candidate would 
be blasted from all sides. I resent the fact that 
this sort of crap is tolerated from a black 
presidential candidate simply because he is 
black. The obvious implication is that we

itt student apologizes
iton
I understand that a letter I wrote to the Pitt 
^ a while back found its way into the 
arch 6 Tartan. I wrote the letter after a 
.n with some CMU students about 
ow easy courses are at Pitt. Ive cooled off 
little since then, and Id really like to apoli to anyone whose feelings I hurt. Of 
urse, CMU students are generally OK, 
d the campus is nice.I took piano lessons 
ere when I was little, and in high school I 
ved to stay and practice all night, till they 
ted locking the doors. I love Lenny 8c 
uiggy> ad WRCT is the best radio staon, bar none.
What hurts is when an unthinking few 
students put on the CMU mentality and 
put down Pitt. It is the same with the few 
from Penn State or Duquesne for that mat
ter.
When they do that, they belittle my studies 
here, as if they were an inferior endeavor. 
That hurts me because it attacks my dreams, 
however small.
Still, I cannot resist mentioning that it is 
certainly a typical sneaky CMU ploy to try 
to slip this little matter by in a small, obs
cure, little-read publication called the Tar
tan! (ar, ar, ar!)

ratto clarifies column
iton
Andrew Sicre misjudged the nature of the 
otests he would receive about this illnceived argument that the only major 
ndidancy for the President who is for the 
ght to life for all is Ronald Reagan. (Tarn, 4/10/84). Sicre feared he would be critic-, 
for being a single issue fanatic. He is 
ore appropriately criticized either for a 
ow and unjust view of right-to-life, or 
r appalling ignorance. The asserdon that 
onald Reagan is for the right to life for 
1 is completely refuted by his actions. 
Since Reagan became President, he has ken emotionally against abortion and x. However, his only actions limiting 
Ttions, however, restricted some federal 
1th funding for abortions. The effect has t been to decrease the number of aborns, but to ensure that poor women and nagers either bear children they can't suprt or have unsafe abortions. Further, there 
reason to believe the number of unwanted gnancies is on the rise due to Reagans empts to eliminate free counseling and 
ntraceptives.
Unfortunately, this may be the least viot of several instances in which Reagans 
licies are responsible for the deaths of 
usands of people:
He has lavished aid and friendship on 
tator Marcos of the Philippines so that 
rcos has no incentive or directive to cease
his brutal tortute and murder of Philippine 
citizens.
He has sold weapons to South Africa 
which enable South African police to con
fine blacks to uninhabitable regions.
He has spent more money on the most 
sophisticated tools for human destruction 
than anyone in history.
He has ordered the CIA to mine merchant 
harbors and equip troops to fire on civilian 
villages in Nicauragua.
He has tried to equip our military with 
nerve gas, which most of the world decided 
was terribly inhumane after the first World 
War.
He continually sends millions of dollars 
in aid to the government of El Salvador, 
which has institutionalized the torture and 
murder of hundreds of thousands of its own
citizens.
He has ordered rocket fire on villages, and 
hospitals of unarmed civilians in Lebanon.
He has pursued legislation and court rul
ings to reinstitute the death penalty.
With brutal weapons and severe poverty, 
Ronald Reagan has killed thousands of peo
ple in the US, Lebanon, Central America, 
the Caribbean, and Africa. Only political 
rhetoric, in this case more aptly called misre
presentation, or hopelessly duped citizens, 
could claim Reagan is for the right-to-life 
for all.

The English Department will present its 
nual Adamson Award for Excellence in 
tmg on Friday, April 27. The ceremony
11 take place in the Adamson Wing of 
tar Hall at 8 p.m. Admission is free, 
he Adamson Awards honor CMU gradand undergraduate students who are 
ted writers in poetry, fiction, or nonon.
e awards are named for Pauline B. 
mson, late wife of CMU alumnus Clar
ence H. Adamson. In her memory, he 
donated a substantial sum of money for the 
annual awards, for scholarships in the Eng
lish department, and for a new wing to 
Baker Hall.
The guest speaker will be Raymond 
Carver, short story writer and poet. Carvers 
work has appeared in many anthologies, 
and one of his stories, A Small, Good 
Thing, was the 1983 first-place winner in 
William Abrahams distinguished shortfiction annual, Prize Stories: The O. Henry 
Awards.
&S card catalog on-line
INloC niECoOgo
to The Tartan 
niversity Libraries has brought up the 
8 awaited online catalog in Engineering 
Science Library. Eight terminals have 
n installed and are available to E&S users. 
2000, the online catalog system, pro
users the chance to search more 
lcklV ard efficiently through the UniverLibraries resources. While searching 
cnventional card catalog is limited to 
0t htle, and structured subject head^ 2000 allows users to search for a 
}V specifying a single word in the title 
utyect heading, as well as providing the
conventional search options. An online cir
culation system, a feature of LS2000 which 
finds a specific book, helps also to find out 
whether or not the book is available.
The database available at this point for 
user searching contains the holdings of E&S 
and Mellon Institute libraries. In the fall of 
1984, the catalog will be available to Hunt 
users also, and the database will include the 
holdings of all three libraries.
According to Patricia Fitzgerald, head of 
E&S Library, the students who have been 
experimenting with LS 2000 have been 
catching on very quickly and seem to be 
excited about it.
Tobias: alternative system
continued from page 18
called Sunshine Silver.) Bank accounts, 
checks, and credit card balances, would be 
dominated in whichever form of money the 
bank uses; perhaps its own banknotes.
The above description is only one possi
ble scenario of the development of non
governmental money. Another possibility 
which has been brought up is credits as 
used in some barter systems today. Barter
ing, as practiced now, has evolved from sim
ple trading to a more organized system in 
which people sell good and services to other 
members of the system in exchange for cred
its w hich are added or subtracted from their
accounts.
The workings of these systems are too 
complex to describe here, but basically the 
number of credits in the system can vary 
dynamically based on the number of goods 
and services being offered. They are not 
backed by gold or silver, but they are not 
fiat money either, since they are based on 
the availability of goods for trade. Some 
have proposed that such systems can be 
expanded to form a basis for an entire eco
nomic system.

Mathematics and is a columnist for The

Shapiro: mixed reflections

stration of friendship and goodwill and do 
something about this character.
 The federal deficit is beginning to look 
like a potential Irwin Allen production. 
Between election year politicking and the 
natural intransigence of both Tip ONeill 
and Ronald Reagan, London bookies must 
be giving long odds on significant Congres
sional or Presidential action before 
November. Of course, people probably 
wont be screwed by sky high interest rates (if 
the Fed sits on the money supply) or by sky 
high inflation (if the Fed moves to hold 
down interest rates) until next year, so the 
politicians can afford to do nothing until 
1985. Whether their constituents can afford 
that is something else altogether.
 One of the more interesting Senate 
races this year is the attempt by North 
Carolina Governor Jim Hunt to relieve 
Senator Jesse Helms, one of the great minds 
of the seventeenth century, of his job. Hunt 
is actually quite moderate in his views, but 
runs the risk of looking like a southern ver
sion of Ted Kennedy in comparison to good 
ole boy Helms. Im waiting to see if the 
voters of that benighted state (which must 
also endure the presence of Helms clone 
John East in its other Senate seat) will see 
through the distortions of the Helms cam
paign and do both themselves and the 
nation a favor.
 Go Dodgers!
