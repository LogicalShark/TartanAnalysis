PLANS FOR JUNIOR PROM NEARING
The plans for the Science Junior 
Prom are coming along in fine shape. 
The two additional committee men 
have been selected and, as it stands, 
the committee consists of
F. B. Dreifus, chairman.
Roy Welter.
G. C. Stone.
J. F. Grffen.
E. A. Pafenbach.
R. M. Russell.
D. B. Gawthrop.
After scouring the city for a suit
able place for the event, the commit
tee decided upon the Twentieth Cen
tury Club as the best under the con
ditions by which they were restricted.
Music has not yet been arranged 
tor, but the best that is available for 
that dateFeburary 28, 1919and 
the program will include 30 dances, 
also a pleasing menu,- which will be 
announced later.
To add to the enjoyment of the 
evening special features are to be 
held during the program, which are 
withheld for announcement entirely.
A lengthy discussion \-vas endured 
by the committee concerning the 
price. It was finally decided that the 
tax would be . six' dollars ($6) per 
couple.
Now, that the time, place as well 
as price have been decided upon it 
is expected that every eligible man 
will be there. Dont forget that date, 
February 28, 1919.
COLONEL DAY FINISHES DESCRIPTION OF RAIDS
| The Science Assembly on Wednes
day, January 29. listened to a talk 
'fo'hich .was-not only entertaining but 
Unusually instructive. Colonel Day 
finished his description which he 
tar,ted last week of a raid made by 
some of the officers and men of his 
"battalion at Newvillevitasse. He told 
it in the same modest, entertaining 
manner which made him immediately 
popular at the assembly on the 
Wednesday previous.
All who heard him now feel that 
-.iliey know something about raids, as 
executed by the Canadians. This 
method of trench warfare was de
veloped by the Canadians, who proved 
to be extraordinarily successful with 
j it.
Raids almost always take plape at 
night. They are participated in by 
from 3 to 250 men. The object is 
not to capture enemy teritory, but to 
obtain a small number of prisoners 
from whom information may be ob| tained. They have a peculiarly de
moralizing effect upon the enemy.
They also tend to strengthen the 
morale of the soldiers. A raid al
ways furnishes, also, a live topic for 
conversation for at least a week, and 
Vjfor this reason keeps the men in 
Vgood spirits.
) A large raid, to be successful, re
quires careful preparation. Everyfthing must be planned with the great'est of care, and arrangements made 
for an effective barrage. Practically 
all the fighting during a raid takes 
the form of man-to-man struggles 
and requires great personal bravery. 
For this reason the entire personnel 
-of a raiding party is obtained from 
the officers and men volunteering.
From Colonel Days description we 
can readily understand why raids, al
though possibly the most hazardous 
lorm of modern warfare, are most 
enthusiastically greeted by the sol
diers.
M. M. C. S. SOPHS GIVE DANCE FOR FRESHMEN
TECH LOSES GAME TO ALLEGHENY COLLEGE;*>
Administrative CouncilDecides Against 
Military Drill This Year
Last Saturday night Tech met the 
fast Allegheny basket ball team in the 
gym on Woodlawn avenue and lost by 
the score of 34 to 22. The Tech men 
played well although the first half of 
the contest was a little one sided. 
The score at the end of the first half 
was 1 to 6 in favor of Allegheny. In 
the second half Tech came back strong 
and scored 16 points to Alleghenys 
18. The second half of the game was 
fast and showed good team work on 
the part of the Tech passers. The 
preliminary was between the fresh
man and Allegheny High School and 
showed an undeciding score till the 
last part when Allegheny rolled up 
some few points more than Tech. The 
score at the finish was 31-25 in favor 
of the high school. There was danc
ing after the games until twelve and 
every one enjoyed a good time. The 
lineup was:

BASKETBALL MEN LEAVE FOR EAST TOMORROW
SCIENCE SCHEDULE WILL PRORAOLY RE CHANGED
The Freshmen and Sophomore 
Classes of M. M. C. S. were allies the ] 
night of Friday, January 31, when the | 
Freshman yellow and white banner 
and the Sophomore yellow and blue j 
banner were displayed together as ; 
the decorations for the Freshman-1 
Sophomore dance. This, the first | 
dance given by any class for the j 
Freshmen, took place in the j
Union. Nirellas Orchestra fur-j
nished the music, and there was j
punch by way of refreshment. The [
dance programs were artistic yellow 
and blue books, credit for getting 
them and everything else connected 
with the dance is due to Miss Dorothy 
Turkle, chairman of the Sophomore 
entertainment committee, who has 
heretofore spent her time in hazing 
|the Freshmen, rather than in enter
taining them.
The decision made by the adminis
trative council, upon military drill 
and physical exercise, may causecon
siderable changes in the schedule of 
the School of Applied Science. Be
fore this time, nothing could be defi
nitely stated It wasnot known 
whether the afternoon hours would be 
absorbed in drill or whether some 
form of physical recreation would be 
required. Up until last year, every 
graduate had to have his credits in 
gymn work. Then the war broke in. 
After much debating, the subject of 
military training at Tech was decid
ed upon. For the first time in the 
history of the school, the gym was 
layed aside and attention was given 
to military authorities. The result 
was hard on the athletics of Tech.
But the! time of military work is 
over. Let us hope that such measures 
must never be taken again. The ad
ministration has deemed it advisable 
not to give these forms of recreation 
to the men of Science School. To the 
upper classmen, this means a maxi
mum of efficiency in their work. What 
is to become of the Freshman?
It has been hinted that the first 
year course will be changed more than 
the schedules of their superiors. In 
previous years, the first year man was 
compelled to take two weeks of shop 
work at the end of the year. This 
was the cause of much loss of time. 
Under the proposed system, the fresh
man will take his shop work in the 
afternoon hours. It has been estimat
ed that three hours per week will 
give him all necessary shop work. 
This means that when he completes 
his academic work for the first year, 
he also finishes his shop work. This 
will take two weeks off the end of 
the year. At this time of the year, 
time is very valuable and it is ex
pected that many freshmen will de
rive benefits from this new schedule.
Our basket ball team is scheduled 
to leave for the East tomorrow. This 
trip, is prophesized to be one of the 
most successful rounds that the Tech 
five has ever made. The team has 
had some severe set-backs this year. 
What was the cause? This is not for 
us to decide. Our part is to get ofit 
and rout and show our spirit. There 
are men who know in back of the 
team. They decide what is best for 
it. We must do all we can to support 
them.
The team has shown marked ability 
in each . of the several games this 
year. We do not feel that Tech has 
ever lost. It will take more than a 
score to convince Tech that a su
perior exists.
We want the team to feel that 
every man in school js with it. There 
are times when victory seems far 
away. This tour through the East 
will show us how easily a goal can 
be reached. The opponents will be 
met every evening for the next three 
days. They, t<Oo, have boasted of 
their ability. Bucknell will be en
countered first. Gettysburg is next. 
The latter team has displayed good 
team work, so far this year. But, it 
is expected to bow her head to the 
Tech Five. On Saturday night, Dick
enson is tackled. This will complete 
the Eastern tour. The spirit of every 
man in Tech will travel with its team.
SENIORS OF INDUSTRIES ELECT NEW OFFICERS
At a meeting of the Senior Class 
School of Applied Industries, the fol
lowing class officers were elected: 
President, Avery; vice president, 
Clauser; secretary, Christenson-; treas
urer, Graham; student departments, 
&aub, Oakley, Couts; department of 
athletics, Mast; club room committee, 
Moore, Polk; student organizations, 
Ritter.
The Senior class social activities 
will start off with a supper and gen
eral get-together meeting at the 
Laurel restaurant, Monday evening. It 
is the plan of the class to hold these 
little meetings regularly.
Y. W. C. A. MAKES GOOD SHOWING THIS YEAR
BRIGHT PROSPECTS FOR MUSICAL CLUBS SEASON
At a short meeting of the insignia 
men, plans for the coming season of 
the Cainegie Musical Clubs were dis
cussed. The annual Ohio trip to 
Warren, Youngstown, Akron and 
Panesville is about arranged. Panesville is a newattraction. Also, there 
is the Pennslyvania trip to Oil City, 
Erie arid New Castle. Mr. Tavelle, 
the mahager, is very confident of 
booking this trip. Taking all in all. 
the Carnegie Musical Clubs have very 
bright prospects for a season.
The management was well pleased 
with (lie turnout for practice on Sun
day afternoon. The Mandolin Club 
already, has four numbers which can 
be played. The Glee Club is coming 
along equally fast. Many old insignia 
men reported. "Smoke Cost, the 
Hawaiian artist, and Nolu, the reader, 
are again witll us.
Thf! vuxecutive committee., .is com
pleting arrangements for a smoker to 
be held in the Union on February 22. 
The purpose of this smoker is to have 
men of both clubs become acquainted, 
as well as the old men and new men. 
Beside the usual smokes and cider 
there will be stunts. These stunts 
are tryouts for special numbers on 
the program. Stunts are encouraged 
by the management, as they make a 
well-roun d ed p rogra m.
The Mandolin Club will be larger 
this year. A call Is made then for 
more mandolin players. The club al
ready has 35 men, but the need of 
mandolin players is urgent. Come 
out now and get in at the start. The 
regular Musical Clubs picture will be 
taken a week from next Sunday.
ACTIVITIES BOARD WILL HOLD MEETING FEB. 12
The first full meeting of the Student 
Activities Board will be held on Wed
nesday, February 12, At this meeting 
officers for the ensuing year will be 
elected. The recommendations of the' 
director will be discussed and later 
will be made public.
A meeting was(held on January 22, 
1919, butowing to' the fact that the 
full body was not present, no definite 
action was taken.
Like all bhe other organizations of 
the school the Y. W. C. A. underwent j 
many trials at the beginning of the 
school year. After the club finally 
was started, the leader, Miss Marian 
Holmes, was unable to attend for 
many weeks on account of illness. It 
was not until after the holidays that 
the work was taken up to be carried 
on in earnest.
Since Christmas the meetings have 
been held each Thursday evening 
from 4.30 to 5:30, in the Recreation 
Hall. 'Service has been chosen as 
the subject for the Winter and Spring 
quarters. At the meeting of January 
30, a girl from each of the seven de
partments of M. M. C. S. told of the 
possibilities of her department. Nat
urally, there was.keen rivalry in some 
instances oyer the merits of the par
ticular departments. The meeting 
closed with a reading byMiss Parry.
The Y. W. C. A. has been fortunate 
in securing many interesting speak
ers in the past, and many are in 
store for the future. It is hoped that 
many girls will come out for these 
meetings; especially are the . new 
girls urged to pa the Club a visit.
SUNNY KESNER WRITES ABOUT W0RK0VER HERE
Work on railroads jn France is de
scribed by Sergt. (Sunny) Kesner, 
former quarterback of Carnegie 
Tech, in a letter written in December 
to his sister, Miss Inez Kesner of 
Natrona. Sergt. Kesner is with the 
Fifteenth Engineers.
We are repairing the railroad from 
Verdun to Sedan, he wrote, and 
have it just about completed. The 
Germans filled the place full of holes 
and dynamited every rail joint, so 
we had quite a little job. You should 
see the thing the Fifteenth Engineers 
call home. We have a train >of box 
cars which we call 'Col. Sturtevants 
Flying Circus/ In each car there are 
33 bunks, just like shelves for 33 lit
tle menthe smaller, the better.
Sergt. Kesner told of having stood 
on the top of tJh,e hill from which the 
Kaiser viewed the battle of Verdun. 
There the sergeant sawmiles of 
American artillery firing at the Huns. 
For a time he was stationed at Neufchateau and again at Jonchery, near 
Chaumont, where Gen. Pershing was 
then jiuartered.
- Sergt. Kesner said he expected to 
arrive? home in February.
Captain Bianchi of Alleghenys fast 
team of last year, has been selected 
coach for this years basket ball 
team. Captain Bianchi is one of the 
best players in the game, playing al
ways fast and clean. At present he 
is playing guard for Westinghouse, 
there displaying the same speed and 
I poise that characterized his work at 
| Meadville.
1-Ie comes to us as a man who we 
believe can whip a fine five into shape 
for the balance of this season, if given 
the proper support, and Tech is one 
of the best schools in the country to 
boost its activities. Go to it, Bi
anchi; we are with you.

PRES. HAMERSCHLAG AGAIN HONORED
At the annual meeting of the As
sociation of 1 College Presidents of 
Pennsylvania, held yesterday in Har
risburg, Dr. A. A. Hamerschlag, presi
dent of the Carnegie Institute of 
Technology, was elected president of 
the organization for the ensuing year. 
He succeeds George L. Omwalco, 
president of Ur;ilnua-College.
Dr. Hamerschlag was also one of 
(/lie speakers at the meeting, talking 
on the question of whether or not 
military training as a permanent 
feature of college life."
INDUSTRY MIDDLEMEN GIVE PLEBES SMOKER
The Middle Class of Industries Is to 
bo congratulated upon the smoker 
that they gave the freshmen and up
per clansmen last Wednesday night 
at the Y. M. C. A. hut.
The prevailing opinion is that Mr. 
Lynn and his staff surely upheld the 
traditions of the school. They suc
ceeded in their efforts to make It one 
of those real, regular, Industry Smok
ers. There were many good fallen by 
both instructors and students. Bill 
Pfouts had his unfailing line. Mr. 
Dosey and Mr. Taylor, with their In
teresting talks and impersonations, 
almost made the boysforget their 
Pall Malls and El Dallos.
Later in the evening,, Mr. Robert 
Seidel announced the reason that Mr. 
Oakley could not speak, tonsilitis is 
said to be the cause.
Dr. Marks need search no farther 
for material for a boxing team. Two 
freshmen put up a fight that makes 
Jess Willard forget Dempsey.
The entertainment was concluded 
with movies1almost.
But, Mabe didnt forget the eats. 
She spared neither quality or quan
tity. In fact, if there was a feed like 
that once a week, the Industry patron
age at Dr. Esqueres banquet hall of 
tin dishes, would cease.
When the party broke up, it was 
the common opinion that the Indus
try School was fast recovering from 
the wreck which the war has caused 
in its spirit.
SOPHS GARNER COLORID SOX, FROSH PEEL MEEKLY
If you noticed several freshmen 
treading lightly as they walked 
across the campus it was riot because 
they had, sore feet. The sophomores 
had deprived them of the ordinary 
foot covering. Some of our fresh
men evidently forgol that black 
socks are in vogue just now. Sopho
mores got busy and held an Inspec
tion Thursday noon and, of course, 
the beautiful colored socks came off. 
Will the Frosh never learn?
SOUTH DORM MEN WISH TO CDANGE TDAT NAME
At a meeting of the South Dormi
tory Association, held on Wednesday, 
January 29, 1919, it was unanimously 
decided that the name. "South Dormi
tory was inadequate, inasmuch as it 
has no' traditional meaning and does 
not indicate the correct position of 
the building.
It was suggested that the name 
Crellin Hall he substituted, in.hon
or of Walter Crellin, who was on the 
ill-fated transport Tuscania," and 
who was the first Tech man to give 
his life for his country.
A resolution was drawn up to that 
effect, and copies were sent to Presi
dent Hamerschlag and Dr. Esquerie.
The administrative council decided 
at the meeting Friday January 31, that 
for the balance of this semester there 
would be no military drill or com
pulsory physical training at Tech for 
the men students. This decision was 
made upon the recommendations of 
Acting Dean Day and Dr. Esquerie.
Some tinie in the near future, how
ever, provision will be made for those 
who desire to take setting up exer
cises for the remainder of this term. 
This  class will come early in the 
morning arid thereby will not inter
fere with the scholastic work in any 
way. It is hoped that many of the 
students will enroll in such a class 
in order that their bodies may be in 
keeping with their mental efforts. 
There is a marked tendency on the 
part of students, unless compelled to 
do so, to follow the line of least re
sistance in regard to exercise, un
mindful of their own welfare. It is 
hoped that this tendency will not1, 
manifest itself among Tech students 
this year.
Next semester, however, it is plan
ned to make some kind of physical 
education compulsory.

Interesting view on board the American dreadnniight Pennsylvania.
ART TREASURE SAVED FROM THE HUNS
The United States Navy School of 
Turbine Engineering was established 
here at Tech by the Naval Auxiliary 
Reserve, acting under the direction 
I of the Bureau of Steam Engineering. 
The first class was admitted Decem
ber 2, 1918.
The purpose of the course is to 
train Naval Officers in the efficient 
operation of Steam Turbines as ap
plied to ship drive. All officers who 
I attend the school have already been 
either a chief engineer or a first asI sistant engineer on board a Naval 
Auxilary Ship. They have been sent 
here to take this course upon recom
mendation of their commanding offi
cers.
The course of instruction lasts for 
four weeks. In this time the theory, 
construction, overhaul and operation 
of marine geared turbines is taken 
up. The course here at Tech is the 
most thorough of its kind. Nowhere 
in this country and, doubtless, in any 
other country is there a more com
plete course in Steam Turbine En
gineering.
When the officers have finished 
their schooling at Tech, they are sent 
to Schenectady, N. Y., to the works of 
the General Electric Company. Here 
they spend one week in learning the 
General Electrical Equipment. After 
tJhis the men return ' to their Naval 
Auxiliary 'Ships with the additional 
information on Steam Turbines.
At the present time a 1,500 H. P. 
geared turbine is being installed in 
the rear of the School of Applied In
dustries. It is being manufactured 
by the Westingliouse Electric Com
pany for a standard 5,000-ton ship as 
diverted to the school for instructing 
officers in its operation, r This turbine 
will drive a propelloj* placed in the 
old tank beneath it. The installa
tion comprises a complete ships en
gine room equipment.
The instructors1, wttio are selected 
by higher authorities, are the very 
best to be had. They are divided be
tween the Navy and the Mechanical 
Engineering Department of the In
stitute. They are as follows:
DirectorLieut. E. H. Henderson.
Executive officerLieut. H. IT. 
Champion, jg.
Officer in chargeEnsign C. L. 
Sampson.
Assistant dibers officerMoriarty.
InstructorsLieut. J. W. Bridges, 
Lieut. J. W. Smith, Lieut. A. K. Mil
ler, Ensign M. E. Blinks, Ensign S. 
IT. Creighton.
CiviliansProf. Trinks, Prof. Estep, 
Prof. Blazdell, Prof. Ambrose, Prof. 
Henning, Prof. Bolton.
There are at all times 75 officers in 
the school. A class of 15 men is 
graduated and another admitted every 
Friday aftehioon. At the graduation 
exercises last week Commodore 
Denig made an address and presented 
the diplomas. He is the head of the 
inspection work in the Pittsburgh 
district.
The men who complete this course 
successfully are sent all over the 
world. They carry the good name of 
Tech with them. Although the Gov
ernment has said that the school will 
continue for two years, it is hopedthat Tech will be privileged with this 
course for years To come.

INTERFRATERNITYIGAMES STARTED LAST WEEK
The basket ball games o the interfraternity league started last week 
and great spirit was shown among the 
frats by the turnouts for, the contests. 
The games were played in a style all 
their own. There were a few times 
when some of the tossers desired to 
have revenge on Omar and Fatima, 
but if a Lucky Strike was made by 
one side the vile weed was forgotten. 
The schedule is arranged to give each 
team a game a week so that the in

when the Colonel addressed th 
students on, as he said, a differen 
phase of the war. War lectures sel 
dom get down to the practical, every
day items that make up a large per 
cent of the life of the soldier, but 
this is what Colonel Day did.
He toid of raising the 185th Bat
talion, of their hard winter spent in 
a tiny village in Nova Scotia, and of 
the spirit of his men. The splendid 
morale of these Canadians, in spite 
of the intense cold and depressing 
snow and slush, called to mind the 
bravery of Washingtons troops at 
Valley Forge, during their hard win
ter. Colonel Day told of the great 
difficulty of getting food in Canada,, 
and getting cooks to cook it, and get
ting proper distribution for it. Thelatter must have been far from an 
easy achievement, as the Colonel spoke 
of one greedy hero, who was courtmartialed for getting two dinners in. 
one day by coming into mess with th 
second relay of men, after he had 
eaten with the first relay.
When the 185th crossed to England 
they no longer had the cold to con
tend with, but the food and food dis
tribution problems were worse than 
ever, as England was so short -of 
food that she could afford to give to 
each soldier but just enoughand if 
anything happened to the days ra
tions, it was indeed a tragedy, for it 
meant that some soldier had to go 
hungry. A general shudder went 
around the audience when Colonel 
Day said that even the fat. of the dish
water was skimmed and used (no one 
dared to wonder for what). Espe
cially the Household Economics stu
dents enjoyed the statement that 
the cooks were alwaysfighting; 
cooks are terrible people to fight 
among themselves.
Perhaps more interesting than any
thing else was the simple, vivid ex
planation of how the rations were 
brought to tihe men in the trenches 
in France, and what a. dangerous job 
was that of bringing it when the com
munication roads were almost alwaysunder enemy fire.
When Colonel Day .said that hemust conclude his address, Deait 
Breed said she would consent to thisonly if he promised to speak again 
very shortly.

THE DRILL QUESTION
Everyone'has undoubtedly noticed the Tartan posters announc
ing that the question of military drill has been decided. This state
ment is very confusing because the real drill question has not been 
settled but it is definite that the Carnegie Institute of Technology 
is an R. O. T. C. institution.
Just how this affects the status of a student is not known either, 
but it is evident that either drill, P. T. or gymnasium work must be 
a part of the regular curriculum. No work in the infantry line will 
be given but it is understood that courses in the coast artillery, 
aviation, engineering and signal corps branches will be given.
The school now awaits orders from the Secretary of War in re
gard to this matter. The opinion of the student body in general is 
against the drill question. This will probably be changed to some 
extent as the government signifies the intention of paying, equipping 
the student as well as giving a reserve commission when the work 
prescribed is completed. This should create some incentive for drill. 
Some form of training ought to be taken to keep up the physique 
and condition of the student. Whether it will be voluntary or not, is 
si ill a question.
CRELLIN HALL (?)
Obviously the South Dorm men. have, taken a great deal of au
thority to decide to change the name of their abode. In doing this we 
believe that they, have not altogether the* say. The owner of the 
building or the school has such authority and it was proper to draw 
up a resolution and send it to the proper authorities. Inasmuch as 
the position being inadequate, if the map is consulted, the direction 
is almost directly south.
Furthermore, it is understood that a satisfactory memorial is 
being planned by President Hamerschlag and the Board of Direc
tors and this mere trifle of changing the name would be as much in
adequate as South Dorm is supposed to bo.
Official Announcement
.All Science students should be sure that the Deans office has 
record of their Pittsburgh addresses. Mr. O'Hara would appreciate 
it very much if I hose who so fur have not given this information 
would comply immediately.
PHYSICAL EDUCATION
Physical Education, discontinued during the war, and one of the 
required subjects for day students, will be scheduled again, under a 
new plan, at the beginning of .the Spring Quarter, by recommendation 
of the Educational Council of the Faculty on January 31, 1919, and 
approved by the President on.the same date.
It is planned to offer facilities for voluntary physical exercise 
for men during the remainder of the .Winter Quarter, as soon as the 
Department of Student Health has made the necessary arrangements.
DEAN OF MEN
On January 29th President Hamerschlag announced the appoint
ment of Mr. A. W. Tarbell as Dean of Men, a newly created position. 
Mr. Tarbell will be the representative of the administration and 
faculties in matters having to do with student activities and welfare: 
He was Registrar from 1908 to 1917, and during the greater part of 
1918 was Acting President, during* Dr. Hamerschlags absence for 
war service in Washington.
COMMENCEMENT DATE
The date for Commencement for 1919 has been set for June 27th. 
It will be the same for all schools.
FRATERNITY INITIATIONS
The Interfraternity Council having petitioned the faculties to set 
a date after which initiations might; be held, it has been voted by the 
faculties to permit initiation of Freshmen in good standing at the 
time of handing in reports on February (1th, 11919. Upperclassmen 
initiations are permitted after February Kith, 1919. This action ap
plies to the present school year only.

By JUNE L. JOHNSON.
(Copyright, 1919, by the McClure Newspaper Syndicate.)
Now, mumsey, dont worry I Well 
get along all right. Give my love to 
Cousin Sue and tell her I hope shell 
soon be better. And dont tire yourself 
out caring for her. . Yes, Ill remem
ber to feed the cat, and that Bob is 
fond of pudding, and that the iceman 
comes on Thursday, andmumsey, do 
hurry or youll miss your train!
With a gay wave of her hand, Mar
gery S------watched her mother out of
sight, and then went into the house. 
A whole week of housekeeping by 
herself! Margery actually hugged 
herself as she thought. Wouldnt she 
prepare the greatest feasts for fa
ther and Bob? Shed make their 
mouths water!
Lets see, what time is it now? 
mused Margery, slipping into a ging
ham apron that enveloped her from 
head to foot. Quarter to five. Time 
to get supper ready. I guess Ill have 
potatoes and salmonandoh ! isnt it 
glorious to be a housekeeper! And 
Margery whirled around the room to 
get rid of some of her bottled-up de
light.
It was the second day of Radford
H-------?s furlough. As he disconsolately
wandered about the town he wondered 
gloomily what to do with the time on 
his hands. Suddenly something hap
pened !
He was starting up a new street, 
when out of the corner house a vision 
in blue and white, with flying brown 
curls, came dashing into his arms, so 
it seemed.
Oh, Tom! breathed the vision, who 
by this time had taken the shape of a 
very pretty, very excited young girl, 
do come in and see if you can fix our 
kitchen range! The old thing wont 
oh !I beg your pardon! And the girl 
backed away in great confusion and 
astonishment.
I say, whats the matter? ex
claimed Radford, regaining his breath 
and finding out that he liked this 
rather extraordinary proceeding than 
otherwise.
Oh, please excuse me, stammered 
Margery; I thought you were Tom
R-------, one of our neighbors! Hes a
sailor, too, and you look exactly like 
him."
Im sorry I disappointed you, re
turned Radford with an amused smile. 
You seem to be in trouble. Pardon 
me, but cant I assist you?
If you dont mind, dimpled Mar
gery, I would like you to see if you 
could fix the old thing.
Ten minutes later a flushed Radford 
with a smudgy face straightened up 
from over the stove and announced 
cheerily to Margery: Its all right
now; it was only clogged' up. You 
can use it.
With a relieved sigh Margery drop
ped into a chair. How can I ever 
thank you? she said. I never could 
have fixed It myself, and I should 
have had to wait until father came 
home, or Bob. Oh, dont you want to 
wash your face?jumping, upits 
rather dirty.
I think you said wlien you came 
in that you had no particular place 
to go, began Margery.. Would you 
she gasped at her own boldness, but 
bravely finished"care to stayfor 
supperwith father, Bob and me? 
Egg beaters, spoons, cake tins, sift
ers and such were very much in evi
dence during the next half-hour, while 
a vfery pink-cheeked Margery and Rad
ford, with an apron on, too, hurried 
back and forth, both chatting merrily 
as they worked.
Imagine Mr. S.s and Bobs sur
prise when they came home that eve
ning to be met at the door by a radi
ant Margery flourishing an egg beat
er, while behind her loomed a tall, 
good-looking sailor, with a broad grin 
on his ruddy face.
Folks, began Margery excitedly, 
please meet
But she never finished, for with one 
leap Bob S. reached the side of Rad
ford, and exclamations such as these 
issued from the eager lips of the two 
young men:
Gr.eat Scott! You here? Why, I 
thought Id lost track of you forever! 
How the world
Why didnt you tell me you lived 
in this district? Id been up here 
yesterday, first thing k Boy, but its 
good to see a familiar face!
With eyes wide open, Margery stared 
at the excited two, who were shaking 
hands vigorously, and pummeling each 
other on the back. Had they gone 
crazy? But Radford settled her doubts 
by explaining to her with twinkling 
eyes: Its my turn to introduce, Miss
S. Your brother Bob and I are old 
friends; we roomed together in college, 
and we havent seen each other since 
graduation.
That night the little party gathered 
around the supper table.
After a merry evening. Radford de
parted, but not until he had left be
hind him promises to return and talk 
over acain the college days with 
Bob. *
True to his promises, Radford did 
come often and was cordially greeted 
by the S. family.
Maybe Im a little suspicioushut it 
seemed as if college was not the only 
topic of conversation and that Bob 
was not the only one who conversed 
with Radford, most of the time.
Anyway, when Radfords furlough 
was ended he left behind him a very 
precious promise and a sparkling soli
taire on a certain somebodys left 
hand. And many times on board ship 
Radfords fellow sailors often heard 
him murmur: Bless that kitchen

JulieAll right, Ill stay.

rumored that Mr. Brown and Doctor 
Esquerre took a course In Calculus

The fact that no Filipino of the

equipped for living without at least 
one male chicken explains why the 
islands, although raising so many 
chickens, still import millions of doz
ens of eggs. As in all cock fighting 
countries the fighting bird in the Phil
ippines is a personal pet which the 
owner carries about during the day 
and on which he lavishes enough care 
to raise many laying hens. Duck eggs 
are rarely found in the market except 
as balutesthat is, eggs on the point 
of hatching, boiled, a form In which 
eggs are commonly eaten by the Fili
pinos. They are sold for lunches at 
all railway stations and at other points 
where crowds gather.

FRED FARGEL, Proprietor
December 27. 1919. 
Dear, Dear Tech Friend.
Via Mrs, Moore:
The day before Christmas was 
beautiful and among other prepara
tion I had to take "your Vic down 
to the French,Eng. round houHe and 
have a certain big hearted Western 
Boldler stop wmwg work on an engine 
and fix that motor. Do not know who 
did hln work but the motor was 
back at the Canteen Christmas Eve in 
running order.
While out In the "I-Ienry" that 
morning I stopped at the A. E. F. 
poHtofllce In hopes of securing my 
3-pound box from home, as 1 had word 
it was mailed In November. I re
ceived only what I thought was a 
nice, fat letter from Mrs. Moore and, 
wishing to read it In my leisure time,
I pul It Into my pocket, returned to 
the canteen and served hot choco
late for a long time. Then business 
slackened a little, and that letter of 
Mrs. Moores burned In my pocket, so 
I stepped aside and opened It. The 
many little messages made me real
ize It was not all from Mrs. Moore, 
but greetings from all. One paper 
dropped on the floor, and I went on 
reading the others. Mrs. Moore 
and Florence mentioned the gift, 
and "hoped I would have as much 
pleasure spending it as you all had in 
sending it. By that time I pidked 
up the paper from the floor, and It 
sure look my breath. The sight of 
Mellon Bank in print. Trancs In value 
and to Corinne C. Adam, well it all 
confused me, and I sure 
drifted back to Pittsburgh and Tech. 
A few loud remarks, "How about a 
little chocolate, and "Gee, that must i 
be from the boy she left behind, and 
I stepped over to my place in the 
chocolate window to see a line of 
waiting soldiers clear across Hie 
room.
Then Marie, my war pal, came In 
to see what the trouble was, and I 
asked her to look at the check and 
see If she saw the same thing I did. 
You cant imagine all that this gift 
meant to my Christmas Over Here. 
It was too late to use, but a very 
small part of it on the Christmas 
Tree. We had made all our plans, 
and couldn't think of a thing to add 
to the Christmas treat except candy 
or popcorn, and that was Impossible 
us neither are to had Over Here. We 
were very fortunate In having eight 
5-pound tins of hard candy sent lo 
the canteen, and a large box of shel
led English walnuts done up in small 
packages. These things were to be 
put on sale at the counter, 'but we 
persuaded the secretary In charge to 
let us give them away along with hot 
chocolate and doughnuts. We were 
very lucky In having these luxuries, 
and 1 had made up my mind they 
should be free, even If Marie and 1 
should have to pay for them. You 
see, friends, wo heap a great deal of 
criticism on the Y. M. C. .s short
comings as an organization, and we 
have decided to change that Idea of 
any soldier by having.him leave our 
canteen happy, and have him take 
something with him which ho did not 
bring. The thing that counts Ovor 
Here Is to have him leave with a 
smile, but again those that come 
often cannot live on smiles. In be
ginning I he work here the flrst tiling 
wo did was to make tlio place clean, 
then attractive, then see lo the writ
ing materials, never run out of same, 
have good pens, Ink, blotters and ash 
I rays. But all boys do not wish to 
write letters nor lo write all the 
time, so we sent for inagazlnes 
American, English and French. We 
had one shelf of hooks, and two days 
before Christmas we received a box 
of sumo, lining live shelves. But all 
the boys do not, care lo read, and I 
still maintain that the way to reach 
a man Is through his stomach, and 
next lo the writing tables the choco
late tables are the most popular In 
the place now. I shall never see a 
doughnut in all the future without a 
vision of same In France. We have 
made hundreds.
The Y. M. C. A. gave a box to each 
soldier containing two bars of choco
late, one of gum, two packs of 
cigarettes and nuts. Marie and 1 
planned to do just a little more in 
this Y, so we began Sunday night, 
December 22 at 9:30 to make one 
doughnut for each of our 1,200 sol
diers stationed here now. We work
ed until 3 a. m., and lost the count, 
but we served hot chocolate, one 
doughnut, cookies, candy and nuts 
from 11 a. m. Christmas morning un
til 6 p. m. free, then the doughnuts 
gave out. also the candy. We had (I 
mean Marie and I) a cheese sandwich 
and a cup of chocolate for the noon 
meal, but a real meal at G:30, and 
then from S to 10 we served again 
and entertained wit'll the Vic. The 
nuts gave out. but the cookies and 
chocolate were In abundance, but we 
were so tired we had to go to bed. 
Christmas evo we put on a movie A 
Message to Garcia.. It touched on 
the Spanish American War, and two 
nights before we had "Tlio Little 
Rebel," a story of tin Civil War. A 
line hunch of old fashioned war stuff 
for war-worn boys away from home. 
I hit. most anything takes, so long as it. 
is a movie.
Well, to go back to my tale; up to 
0:80 Christmas eve there was not a 
sign of Christmas anywhere In t'ho 
canteen. We wanted it all to be a 
real surprise, so we asked about six 
of the boys to help. Then we all 
hustled. The Saturday before we 
took Henry and went to the country 
for a tree. There is a law in France 
against cutting trees, so again we
called on our good French friend, 
Paul Dottln to help us out. He guid
ed us to a distant relatives chateau, 
where we were ushered In by a serv
ant, and then the owners came In, a 
little old lady and poorly dressed, 
but wearing the most gorgeous dia
mond earrings I ever hope to see. 
Then the old gentleman, a nobleman, 
If you please, appeared hobbling 
along on two very stout canes, and 
with every step showing an expres
sion of pain. He had the gout and 
showed it. We sat down and talked 
about the weather, and then Paul 
mentioned the tree. Nothing would 
do but that old gentleman must lead 
us to the forest, himself. He spoke 
a little English, taking interest in 
telling us /that his son was in Wash
ington in Government work. I did 
not miss a thing on that trip, as the 
procession proceeded so slowly on ac
count of the gout. I slipped into the 
green-house, a small one, where a lit
tle of everything grew, from gerani
ums to oranges, gathered violets and 
myrtle in the Woods and found a 
lovely little spring and moss cover
ed shingled house, and caught up to 
the gout and Marie and I agreed in
stantly on the same tree. The serv
ant chopped it down and dragged it 
back to old Henry, and thus we got 
It to the canteen. We had It set up 
Christmas eve, and It stands 20 feet, 
If not more. We trimmed the upper 
half from the balcony, and then we 
hung It with this silver thread. I 
am sending to Florence a picture 
and water color made by a. Belgian 
refugee, who lives on the fifth floor, 
showing a diagonal view of the court 
at Thanksgiving and the opposite 
view of court at Christmas, and want 
you all to see it. The Y sent us two 
Christmas boxes from Paris for deco
rating tree and rooms, and they were 
most complete. Each contained a 
Santa suit, balls, tinsel, favors, flags, 
lanterns, candles, horns, whistles, 
paper decorations, etc. It was a 
pleasure to unpack. I acted like a 
kid with a box from home.
We had bushels of mistletoe and 
some holly and both were beautiful. 
However, it was an unfair game with 
the mistletoe, being two to 1,200, so 
we only used it for decorations. We 
worked until after midnight, then 
served the boys sandwiches and 
chocolate. I cant begin to describe 
the court, but the print will give you 
an idea. When Marie and I finished 
it 1 a. m. and stood on the balcony 
looking down at It all. we had a deep 
feeling of joy in knowing that the boys 
would like It, and I especially felt 
some comfort in my opportunity of 
doing for the many brothers Over 
Here in memory of my own only 
brother.
Marie and I wanted to hang up 
stockings, so we did so for each of 
the maids, giving them the pair of 
stockings each, some money, manderlnes, American soap, nuts, candy 
and a toy soldier. They are much in
terested in soldiers, you understand. 
We also did up a package for each of 
the three Y secretaries now here/ 
Marie brought a 6-pound tin of mixed 
hard candies from America, and I had 
some Wilburs chocolates and Life 
Savers.
When we finally crawled into bed. 
the Christmas season and lateness of 
the hour made me truly think of my 
dorm, life and some such similar 
preparations. Floronce can tell you 
those tales.
The maids awakened us In the 
morning *by their exclamations over 
the filled stockings. In France they 
colobrate the New Year and always 
sot their shoes by the chimney, and 
never have a. Christmas tree, from 
what we gather of this section.
Wo wore citizen's clothes1 for the 
first time In our canteen, nnd the sec
ond time in France. Appeared on the 
balcony just as the chaplin took his 
place beside the tree and using a 
chocolate service table for his Bible 
and hymn book to rest on, started the 
Christmas service. It was a pretty 
service, and the court and rooms 
were crowded and the fellows sang 
so well. I shall never forget it.
Marie and I lost more sleep last 
night trying to figure out what we 
could get for the boys New Year's 
party with part of your gift. I have 
often been, in the fix of wanting some
thing and not having the where-withall to get it, but never before ex
perienced the opposite circumstance. 
Candy is the soldiers want, and that 
is not to be had, nor can we get ma
terial to make same.
We are holding open Y New Year's 
eve, so the boys can all join us in 
seeing the old year out and the new 
in. I shall write you later of what 
we did. If I do not end this journal 
now, I shall be running into the next 
year. You will agree with me, how
ever, that it. is hard to leave a good 
thing, dear friends. I have not writ
ten you often but goodness, I do not 
know when to stop when once start
ed.
Believe me, I thank you with all 
my heart for the gift and the abund
ance of it, Beaucop France." It sure 
makes me happy Over Here to re
ceive such favors from you Over 
There, and I s'liall use it to make 
many others happy and shall write of 
that, agaiii. In sincere thanks and all 
good Wlsll08.

William S. Hart will be seen^at the 
New Million Dollar Grand all next: 
week, starting Monday morning, Feb
ruary 10, in. his latest Artcraft photo
play,. Breed of Men. 1 Hart always 
excels in a role wherein he is seen as 
a daredevil of the open country, a man 
with red blood and unlimited daring. 
This is the kind of role he has been 
provided with in Breed of Men, and 
he handles It with the vigor and act
ing that characterizes all his efforts. 
Many of the scenes were filmed in the 
Chicago stock yards and was com
pleted in California and there are wild 
riding, stirring battles and thriving 
scenes.
Hart is seen as Careless Carmody, 
cowpuncher .who drifts into Chloride, 
Ariz. The town is owned and con
trolled by Wesley P. Prentice, a land 
shark from the East, who is selling 
property to which he has not a clear 
title. Among his victims is Ruth Fel
lows, a young woman who has settled 
upon a section and is farming it with 
her little brother. Careless, fleeced 
of all he owns in a crooked gambling 
game, at Prentices orders, accepts 
Prentices offer to become sheriff. He 
thus unwittingly is made the tool of 
the land shark. A Mexican stabs a 
man and seeks refuge in. Ruths house 
where Careless finds him and pre
vents his injuring Ruth. Careless 
is then obliged by virtue of his office 
to serve dispossess papers on Ruth, 
and the latter takes refuge in her 
shack and shoots him in the shoulder. 
The act wins "Careless  undying 
love for Ruth, and he begins to inquire 
into the true state of affairs. The 
things that occur as a result are some 
of the most stirring that have ever 
been put into a motion picture. They 
lead through exciting and unexpected 
means to a happy ending. Hart is 
well' supported by Seena Owen, Bert 
Sprotte, and Buster Irving. The story 
was written by J. G. Hawks, and 
Thomas II. Ince supervised the pro
duction.
Four photoplays of the finest type 
will be presented in the Grand pro 
gram in addition to the Hart pic
ture. . The Symphony Orchestra, un
der Director David Broudy, and the 
large pipe organ will play each.day.
