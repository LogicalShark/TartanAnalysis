12:30 THURSDAY, JUNE1
The weather had been threatening 
.a sprinkle of rain had fallen, 'but, 
then, the clouds parted and the set
ting sun shone through in forgiving 
brilliancy. Early vendors were shout
ing their wares, street urchins and 
newsboys were the first to arrive and 
as the last shafts, of sunlight spent 
themselves on far distant hills and 
twilight was waiting, all darkness, 
pierrots, pierres, torradors, monks, 
seniors, senoritas, sultans and kings 
and Campus week friends assembled 
on the Design School lawn.
The movie men rushed in the 
. scene, with cables, lights and camera. 
A delay until the movie men got set. 
The crowd was becoming restless, 
a titter and tatter. The constant 
hum of conversation the bluish aclinic 
light of the floodlight illuminated the 
throng.
A trumpets 'blasta trembling 
hush ran through the crowding mass 
a stillness among those straining 
costumed figuresa tenseness ex
tending, even to the camera man, 
permeated and held that same four 
thousand who were assembled last 
Friday night, on the Design School 
lawn, to Witness the coronation cere
monies of our Mardi Gras Queen.
The Queen, Miss Josephine Whit
ney, stately and tall, vested in white 
satins and silks, followed by her 
ladies in waiting Misses Mary Little, 
Ann McDonald, Mary Lissfelt and 
Marian Scottthe band playing "Our 
Conquering Hero came down tn* 
walkthe cardinal and the crown 
bearer approaching from the other 
side. Gloom and sad have departed, 
fun and frivolity are here and in the { 
name of the spirit of Campus Week, 
Queen of the Mardi Gras. So say
ing he placed the crown of flowers 
on Miss Whitney's head, officially 
crowning her the first Queen of Car
negie Techs greatest Mardi Gras.
Following this, the movie men had 
those who were in costume, pass be
fore the camera. A rush tooto get 
their mugs on the film.
Four weeks ago when the contest 
for the Mardi Gras Queen was start
ed, little interest was shown and 
many expressed their inadvisability. 
Friday night, it was the general opin
ion that the coronation of Miss Jose
phine Whitney, as Queen of the Mardi 
Gras, was the pi'ettiest event of 
Campus Week, one that created more 
than general interest and carried 
with it a pex-sonal interest which is 
more detrimental bhan anything else.
Congratulations to next years 
Queen.
There will be a short meet
ing of all track men in the Var
sity Club Room at 12:30 Thurs
day, June 1. Every man should 
be present, as there is impor
tant business to be taken up.
Be there.

Rennys Place Sat.
Ross Hertz Plays Leading 
Role in Comedy
The curtain for Campus Week of 
1922 went down last Satux-day night 
with the presentation of Rennys 
Place, a three act comedy.
Standixxg room was at a premium 
in the Schenley theatx*e long before 
the pex-fox-mance stax-ted, and when 
' the cux*tain went' up Renny from 
behind thelunch counter of a one 
horse hash emporium gazed upon 
a capacity crowd of students, alumni, 
and friends of Carnegie Tech.
Little needs to be said of Renny. 
Those who saw his perfoxmance in 
th role of the little inn keeper had 
for him nothing but px-aise. Larx-y 
Paquin in the role of the xxxotion pictux-e schemer, and Joseph Lazaxhxs, 
bx-ought out rounds of laughter. 
George Hoag vei-y ably took the part 
of the chairman of the Board of 1 
Commerce of Chesser, Illinois. Any : 
small town would be proud of such 
an enthusiastic boostex\ No words 
can describe Marguerite Hannan, who 
took the pax-t of May. The one 
word hard is the writers best bet 
and that word probably describes her 
best. Cai*l Reid surely had the 
 worst of the autonxobile deal if his 
actions in the role of Jake Johnson 
did him justice.
Evei'y chax-acter in the entire com
edy perfonned admirably and the 
Courier was surely right when it said 
that any one who saw Rennys 
Place and didnt get a few thrills 
was mentally unbalanced.
Did* everybody have a good time? 
Well say they must have, if they at
tended any part of Campus Week fes
tivities. /
First came the vaudeville show at 
10:30 Thursday morning at the 
libx*ary. You should have seen the 
crowd. Standing room was scarce, 
and even the second balcony was filled 
to capacity. As for the show, every
body went away with a happy thought 
in his heart for the initial event, the 
celebration.
Thursday afternoon the Plebe Class 
of 1925 became an active part of the 
Carnegie Class. Every Plebe in the 
class was in the parade which stretch
ed from the front oT Design School 
to the Field House. On the athletic 
field the Plebes filed slowly by the 
coffin of Old Man P. R. and deposited 
their socks, ties, arm-bands, and caps, 
which were afterwards set fix-e to.
The baseball game with Penn State 
was halted by rain in the third in
ning with the visitors leading, with 
one run. Friday afternoon, however, 
the game with Bethany was played in 
spite of the rain and a muddy field. 
Carnegie won, 7-G.
Dances were held nights and the 
attendance was extra good. The 
Mardi Gx-as Friday nightwas the 
climax.
Perhaps the most exciting event 
was the Sweepstakes race Friday 
moxning, Evex*y fratexnity in the 
campus had an entry. A trophy was 
awarded to both the speed-king and 
he cleverest design.
Remigs Place was a fitting close 
for the week's events. This play, 
written and produced by the Drama 
students, shows the high type of actoxs which the Drama Department 
turns out. The play caused one good 
laugh after another. The standing 
room was taken and a great many 
were unable to see the play.
THIRTY DESIGN PLEBES
AT FIELD TRIAL
The Design Sophs held their last 
Plebe trial on Thursday afternoon, 
May 18, in the Drafting Room.
Some thirty convicts faced the 
judge for their punishment. One con
vict.had to wear ribbons in his hair, 
othera had various penalties, while 
some got off easy. The program v/as 
short and snappy. Several hair cuts 
took place, both for Sophs and 
Plebes.
But, no more trials!!!
Poor Sophs.
plifier.
The immensity of the postal serv
ice hitherto unthought of by the pub
lic was very clearly outlined by Mr. 
Hayes. He described the humanizing 
of the postal service as simply a 
1922 application of the golden rule.
In speaking of the motion picture 
'business Mr: Hayes impressed the 
audience with the degree of faibhfulness in which he is taking up his 
work. He said that the aim of the 
association of which he was the head 
was partly to develop the educational 
as well as the general value of mo
tion pictures. He feels that there is 
a feeling among the producers in the 
motion pictux*e industry, of eax*nestness and integrity to carry out these 
purposes.
In regard to the program under
taken .'by the governing 'body of the 
picture industxy he said in part: 
There is no program of reform. 
With the feeling that the integrity 
of the motion pictures should be pro
tected, he 'believes that ho has en
tered on a duty where a great deal 
of good work can he done.
Mr. Hayes emphasized the fact 
that the motion picture is essentially 
an amusement. Over 20,000,000 peo
ple visit the movies each day, and 
if the people of this country do not 
have their amusement, tho country 
might' be likened into a little child 
who in a spell of crying can be 
quited by the shaking of a rattle or 
in other words, by ibeing amused.
In tho closing words of his appeal, 
a cry for common sense and con
fidence impressed evexyono with the 
earnestness of his intentions. Lot us 
lay bricks, not throw them, surely 
fitted not only his subject but his life 
in general.
Mr. Hayes shook hands with the 
Queen of tJhe Mardi Gras and divided 
the Sweepstakes prize between the 
two fraternities who tied for first 
honoi-s. The winner's of the Swope 
prizes and the George Smith Schol
arship were also congratulated, 'by 
Mr. Hayes.

Griffin M. Lovelace, Director of the

Jupiter Pluvius, after several at
tempts finally decided to give up try
ing to damper tho Sweepstakes and 
at 10 a. m. the shot that staxted 
twenty racing cars on tho coux'so 
echoed over the hills of Schenley 
Park,
The Delta Upsllon grasshopper was 
a bit too fiisky aiul as it rounded the 
first 'bend took  one mighty jump 
which put it out of the race. At the 
first turn in tho qourso speed car No. 
1 owned 'by Sigma Epsilon Phi 
forged ahead. At the top of tho hill 
the armored car of S. A. E. caught 
up with the Sigma Epsilon Phi car. 
On the down grade tho Sigma Epsilon 
Phi car again took the lead and was 
leading* tho other by one ihwndrod 
feet, when a rear1 tire came oft. The 
S. A. E. car soon passed tho leader 
at this point, followed 'by -several 
others 'in rapid succession.
The crowd entered mndly, girl* 
screamed, men embraced and amid 
loud yelling S. A. E. and Pi Kappa 
Alpha crossed the finishing line re
sulting in a draw.
The prize for unique design went 
to the Pirate Ship of Sigma Nu.
Alpha Kappa Psi, a girls soroiby, 
entered tho x-aces and stuck to the 
course until engine trouble developed.
Cups wero presented to tho winners 
by Will Hayes. He congratulated 
them for tho spirit shown, and, being 
a true Solomon, he devised a method 
to divide a cup so that it would be 
satisfactory to both parties.

The meeting of the Physics Coloquim have for some time been of 
great scientific interest. On Thurs
day, April 20, Mr. R. W. Boreman 
gave an account of some of Crehores 
recent developments in the region of 
atomic theoiy. Crehores specula
tions are daring and his conclusions 
as to physical dimensions very sweep
ing. He endeavors to reduce all phys
ical dimentions to two.
On Thursday afternoon May 4, Mr. 
C. C. Williamson discusasd Frank
lins experiment on the Leyden jar 
with movable coatings. Some recent 
work appears to show that the re
sults of this classical experiment are 
very different when paraffin or some 
other non-hygroscoplc substance is i 
used as dielectric. Mr. P. H. Crago j 
oh the same afternoon described Ew-1 
ings new, model for illustrating fer
romagnetic Induction. The revision 
of this famous model has been made 
necessary by the rapid growth In our 
knowledge of molecular and atomic 
structure.
On Thursday, May 11, Prof. H. L. 
Moore described iSir Ernest Ruther
fords recent work on the Artificial 
Disintegration of the Elements. Pro
fessor Rutherford has continued Ills 
attacks on the citadel of the atom 
(technically called the nucleus), and 
has been able by means of bombard
ment with alpha particles to knock 
off hydrogen atoms from the nucler
versity, New York City, where he 
will go in September to organize and 
become the head of the Department 
(of Life Insurance Salesmanship in 
'the School of Commerce.
Mr. Lovelace leaves Carnegie Tech 
the end of next month for Los An
geles, Cal., where he will organize a 
nine week summer school, beginning 
July 5, in Life Insuiance Salesman
ship, under the auspices of the Los 
Angeles Life Underwriters Associa
tion. Assisting Mr. Lovelace will be 
Dr. Edw. K. Strong, Prof. Chas. J. 
Rockwell, and Miss Lizzie Bean, all 
of Carnegie Tech.
Under Mir. Lovelaces supervision, 
the Insurance Salesmanship School 
hex*e has grown to prominence in 
three yeax-s, graduating more than 
600 students from all the prominent 
life insux-ance companies, with 
courses of eleven weeks each. The 
retiring head attended. Vandei'bilt 
University, 1894-97, and the Univexsity of Berlin, 1898-99, and was 
connected with several prominent in
surance companies in executive ca
pacities, until he came to Carnegie 
Teoh in 1919.

Upon his recommendation, the Mer
ril System Corporation, of Pitts
burgh, Pa., have formulated plans to 
build a large apartment house on the 
corner of Forbes and Beeler. This 
building will contain on^b hundred and 
twenty-five completo apartments, in 
addition to a large ballroom for 
faculty and student dances, swim
ming pool, and tennis pourts. As can 
bo readily seen, this apartment will 
supply a present great demand. It 
should add to tho efficiency and gen
eral improvement of our school, for 
it is of comparatively aa great im
portance to have comfoi*table and 
reasonably prices 'homes for our 
faculty as it is for the students. This 
building will bo in a very convenient 
location, and from tho proposed plans, 
will present a vex-y attractive ap
pearance.
Tho main entranco to the apart
ment will bo on Forbes street, while 
the building will extend along Beeler 
in six complete wings, on the left 
hand side of tho street facing ForboB. 
Tho building is expected to cost in 
tho neighborhood of $750,000, work 
to begin around Juno 15, so that it 
will bo ready for occupation by Oct
ober 15. Tho architect in charge of 
the plans is Prof. Thayor, a former 
instructor in Architecture at Carnegie 
Tech.
In addition to tho above mentioned 
plans, a large and complete, cafeteria 
is to ibo inballo(| for student and 
faculty convenience. Tho entire syatom is to be managed on aa nearly a 
cost 'basis as is possible, tho con
venience to tho faculty and students 
being paramount. Although tho 
school is connected in no way with 
tho establishment, it allows a marked 
development of outside capital to 
realize 'the permanency of-our insti
tution and tho possibilities of our fuj 
turo dovolopmonts.
From the fact that this will pr 
vide a convenient homo for Carnoglo 
Tech faculty, it will add to our soho* 
spirit. TJio faculty will have more 
common, will bo hotter able to attend 
school activities, and will in many 
ways bring thorn in closer contac 
with the student body. The institu
tion will bo hotter able to 'hold Iti 
trained instructors, since their living 
oxponso and their salaries will mor 
easily 'balance.

EXIT THIRD CAMPUS WEEK
Twice as manyahimtai back as last year. This is a measure of 
tile success of Campus Week. Nearly every clan had some represen
tative here; even to the Farthest West Clan ol! Los Angeles. A 
large num'ber of recent graduates were in evidence; which tends to 
show that these alumni, who are familiar with the celebration, ap
preciate what it means. The older graduates, who have not attended 
Campus Week, hesitate about returning. All alumni who were here 
voiced the assurance that they will be here next year. No doubt 
they will interest others.
The program was much improved. Such new features as: Rennys Place, Interfraternity Dance, Will Hays speech, the election 
of the Queen of the Mardi Gras and the Womens Banquet show 
proMess.
A. few constructive criticisms are in order at this time. Regular 
bus service should have been provided for Interfraternity Dances. 
The Qualification and Call exercises were not as impressive as in the 
past, because of the condition on the athletic field. The confusion 
resulting from the crowd being on the race course at the finish was 
not. anticipated.
A big problem for next year is a solution to keep the outside 
clement away from the Mardi Gras. It was evident that many peo
ple were present who were not invited. This condition will, tend to 
ruin purpose of the occasion also most of the strangers are not 
Concerned about the moral impression the alumni may acquire of the 
student body.
Next year will bring greater possibilities for Campus Week. 
The now Gymnasium will, be finished. This will afford a good op
portunity for new developments.
A small portion of the student body did the work required to 
make Campus Week a reality. Those people did not see a big part 
of the celebration. They worked, so that the students and alumni 
would have a good time. Their only roward was, perhaps, the pleas
ure derived from knowing that others wore mnde happy. To these 
persons wo all owe our gratitude.
Calendar of Student Events
ROAMINS
Now that the year. Is most at an 
end, Roamer would like. To take one 
last long fling. Tired of knocking. Sup
pose you are too. Or wherever you 
go. Dont forget Carnegie Tech, You 
owe her more. Than you can ever re
pay. Let each graduate remember. 
When he meets a darn good; feller. That 
there's always room. For one more. 
Down at Tech, Don't forget your Al
ma Mater. An come back when'er 
you can. You'll appreciate the place. 
When you havent go.t to race. To a 
class or some such other darn ol' 
thing,
To those who stay behind. To com
plete the dizzy grind. Get together. 
Pull harder. For Carnegies cornin' 
up. In our (little world collegiate. 
fStart the new year right. And boost 
the team at Yale. Let's scare them 
the same. A we did Penn State. 
With the score reversed.
We all like to kick.. About this an 
that. But after alls said an done. 
Carnegie Is not half as bad as some. 
You work a little harder than 'most 
of tho rest. But Itu always hard work. 
That gets you the best. We've lots of 
advanluges. That are only dreams. To 
other colleges. With more cornin. 
Every day. So while you're here. Make 
the most of it all. For Carnegie will 
soon be. The cynosure of all eyes.
Campus Week! The most wonder
ful time of the year. Three days of 
pleasure, excitement and fun have 
passed by. The wonderful nights are 
but memories, the gay afternoons are 
things of the past. Nought now re
mains but to make up lost sleep.
We say good-bye to the glorious 
girls who shared our good times or 
should I say, caused them? We take 
our admiring parents to the station 
and ship them back from the won
ders of Carnegie in spring, to the 
sordid details of every-day life.
In one short week examinations will 
come again to ruin our days and nights 
with worries and cramming. Already 
we have started borrowing money to 
pay the debts contracted during the 
week.
We have sown the wind, we must 
reap the whirlwind. But say, boy, 
what wouldnt you give to sow a wind 
like that three times a year instead 
of once? It's worth anything to 
throw aside all worries and plunge, 
carefree, into the mad whirl of Cam
pus Week entertainment.
So here's to, Campus Week, God 
bless it, A pilgrimage for Alumni, an 
mancipation for plebes, a memory for 
Seniors, a vacation for the Faculty, 
a boost for Carnegie, and the wonder
ful time for everyone.

FIRST ANNUAL WOMENS

On Saturday evening, in the Mar
garet Morrispn lunch room, tho 
women (it has never quite been de
cided whether women or "girls 
should be used in a case of this kind) 
of Carnegie Tech met together for 
the First Annual Womens Banquet.
The lunch room was well filled; in 
fact, Miss Breed suggested enlarging 
it immediately, in preparation for the 
Second Annual Banquet.
Miss Helen P. Reed acted as toastmistress; music was furnished by the 
stringers. Mrs. J. O. Miller was the 
principal speaker of the evening, and 
talked most interestingly on Womens 
Place and Interest in Politics.
Ensemble singing added to the jol
lity of the occasion, alumnae and un
dergraduates all joining in Dear Old 
Tech, and old familiar songs.
Flowers were presented Mrs. Scales 
and Mrs. Breed as a slight token of 
appreciation for their work in the 
school.

COMMENTS
THE UNPARDONABLE SIN
John R. Mott, speaking Sunday 
night to a convocation crowd that 
rivaled in size those that packed the 
Gymnasium on Friday and Saturday 
night for the A. & M. basket bail 
games, struck a keynote when he 
named indifference as the cardinal 
sin of which a college can be guilty. 
Better by far cynicism than indiffer
ence, he said, for the great need of 
today is a need for thinkers; and if 
students are thinking enough tq be 
intelligently cynical, even though 
they are off the main road, now, the 
truth eventually will reach them. 
But if they are characterized only by 
complacement indifference, -even if 
they see what the truth is, wliat does 
it profit?
Indifference, it should be remem
bered, however, will not be driven 
out; of a school merely by an appeal
closer understanding.
MORE SONGS WANTED BY
SONG BOOK COMMITTEES
During tho past few weeks little 
material for the Tech Song Book has 
boon received. Everybody agrees the 
need of a Tech Song Book, but when 
it comes to a show down, there is 
little response.
A collection of ge-;l songs has been 
submitted, but for a real Carnegie 
Song Book, more are needed. The 
committee expects to bring the songs 
before the student body at an assem
bly soon.
Do you want your song sung?

CRITICISM OF GIACOSA8
"LIKE FALLING LEAVES
Giacosa's "Like Falling Leaves came 
to the Italian stage in 1900 as the 
climax of a play-writing career which 
began thirty years before and was to 
endure a half-decade longer. It is a 
study on the conventional theme of 
the effect of mild financial misfortune upon the members of an upper 
middle class aamlly. Tho step-mother and the Idle son, Tommy, flutter 
like falling leaves to their destruc
tion. The capable daughter is ade
quate to the situation, till, distressed 
by her familys misbehavior, she is 
driven almost to suicide by an accu
mulation of suffering and misunder
standing. The latter banished, a wor
thy though 111 bred cousin Ib adhoitly 
in the wings to administer consola
tion.
Ones prime curiosity was what a 
Tech-trained audience would think of 
one of the finest successes of the mod
ern stage. For such an audience, 
there would be no question of con
sidering the long struggle to quicken 
with realism a national stage morbid 
with romanticism, no question of recorganizing the adroit portrayal of so
cial types, of appreciating an alien 
ethical atmosphere. To it, rather, 
would appeal the opportunity to set 
this acted play beside the malicious 
etehery of The Thunderbolt', the 
snap-dragon fusllade of Shavanism 
or the adjacent native moralizing of 
Foolish Wives. In such a compar
ison, the play stands high. The fig
ures and their movements across the 
screen are distinct; the bourgeois
scorn of art and refinement and lipservice to efficiency and simplicity of 
manners are congenial, and if the 
shadows in 'the picture seem mirthprovoking, one may blame the tone 
of the production as well as the local 
tendency to find anything but Shakespere a joke.
Miss Dices direction of the produc
tion is, on the whole, skillful and ef
fective. The main defect is the keep
ing of the general tone too light. This 
smiling over delinquencies ill pre
pares for the subtle gradation to Nennelles resolve to take her life; with 
this and the sober finale, the general 
sunniness hardly agrees. Despite 
this qualification, the production is 
ingenious and telling. The focus of 
the drama is the daughter, and in 
this part Miss Lissfelt does her best 
work this year. Her method is quiet 
and repressed,, and^her temptation to 
drone the pathetic notp is avoided. 
If her climax in the third act is not 
as apparent as it might be, it may 
bo alleged that the scene is designed 
to get its effect by suggestion not by 
affirmation. Mrs. Reid as the honest un
observant bankrupt father gets little 
opportunity until the last trying aot 
which Miss Lissfelt makes appealing 
though the tempo is needlessly slug
gish. Miss Grey hardly extracts all 
the possibilities from the role of the 
step-mother. Besjfles seeming too 
young, she underestimates the sinis
ter emotion which - leads the, woman

Bill Pfouts, Pattern 
Maker, Philosopher
Sketch of His Career as Re
vealed in Interview
When Andrew Carnegie planned to 
build Carnegie Tech, he picked out 
Dr. A. A. Hamerschlag as the man 
to take charge of the enormous re
sponsibility of such an undertaking. 
Dr. Hamerschlag proceeded to pick 
the men he thought most capable of 
developing the various departments 
Andrew Carnegie had in mind; Mr. 
William Pfouts was one of these 
men.
Mr. Pfouts, Universally known at 
Carnegie Tech as "Bill Pfouts, has 
been connected with our school since 
its infancy. He knew Carnegie Tech
WILLIAM PFOUTS
when Central Building was only a 
blue print in an architect's office.
Before he 'became connected with 
our school he was employed by the 
William Tod Co., of Youngstown, O., 
in charge of pattern making. Mr. 
Pfouts drew up plans for the pat
tern shop, scarcely any change being 
necessary in the past ten years. The 
efficiency of his system of training 
men is shown by the stability of the 
course. Unlike many other instructors, Mr. Pfouts does not think that 
the work of his department most im
portant in the training of the en
gineer.
Bill* has the interest of the whole 
school at heart. This is shown by 
his popularity at various smokers and 
banquets of the students. We dont 
need to mention his ready joke or 
bit of humor, forhis reputation has 
far preceeded him. He is also a 
philosopher, as any one can see from 
the information pasted on his pattern 
shop bulletin hoard.
Speaking of students, Mr. Pfouts 
agrees at least once with ex-president 
Wilson. Mr. Wilson once said, A 
young scholar learns more through 
association with the faculty and stu
dents than he does from his books. 
This conforms in entirety with Mr. 
Pfouts idea. He says that, When 
tho student shows the right attitude, 
he makes friends with his instructors 
and fellow students, this association 
meaning more to him than does his 
studying. He believes very heaitily 
in any school event that will bring 
the Carnegie Tech boys and girls together.
event.
Campus week is one such
In reference to Campus Week, he 
marked, This is one event which is 
a howling success, a sample of what 
we should have ten times a year. We 
dont have enough traditional events. 
When Carnegie Tech was still a very 
small school, the fellows used to have 
a big rumpus about every two months. 
These stunts are the things to pro
mote true Carnegie spirit. Mr. 
Pfouts never forgets the struggle 
Carnegie Tech made to rise to its 
present height. Nor is he stingy in 
his praise of President Hamerschlag.
Bill always telljj of his three 
fads: his wife, his daughter, and his 
boy. The latter two evidently are 
intended to/be Carnegie material, his 
daughter at present being a student 
in the College of Fine Arts. We pre
dict a Carnegie engineer of the boy, 
and hardly see how he can fall short.
COSTUME ECONOMICS CLUB
ENTERTAINS H. E. CLUB
One of the most enjoyable features 
of Campus Week was the picnic in 
Fricks Woods, given by the Costume 
Economics Club for the Household 
Economics Club. This may have been 
an effort to show the H. E.s up 
as to cookery, and. if it was, we must 
admit it was fairly successful.

The beginning of Campus Week 
was observed on the part of the 
Plebes by intense quiet. Usually, 
every year at quaJification time, the

the surrounding scenery with their 
class numerals.
This year the spirit was conspicu
ous by its absence. It was expected 
that the plebes would he out for a 
good time, just before their regula
tions were removed, ibut such was not 
the case. The dorms were silent, and 
no one could guess the reason why.
The reason was not far away. In 
fact it was very near. Across the 
street in the field house were gath
ered about one hundred sophomores, 
who had assembled there from the 
dorms and fraternity houses to he in 
readiness for any outbreak on the 
part of the plebes. From 12 p. m, to 
4 a. m., the watchful waiting was 
kept up, and besides waiting, the most 
excitingthing to do was to play 
bridge.
It is to ho hoped that the class of 
'20 has enough, spirit to start a. cele
bration, whether they succeed 
finishing it or not.

V A SCHOOL NOT A PUBLIC DANCE HALL 
CongratulationsCampus Week 
Committee.
In every way last week was the 
greatest week since tho engineer of 
this column has been in this school, 
and it would not be far amiss to say 
it was the greatest in the history bt 
Carnegie Tech. It cannot arid will 
not be denied that Campus Week was 
absolutely and positively the very 
best yet On THAT,, no argument is 
necessary.
But, in the way of interest, and of 
bearing on the future, the results of 
the meeting of football officials, coach
es, an derpresentative of the various 
colleges of the East takes foremost 
place. The purpose of this meeting 
was primarily to rate football games 
of each date in respect to their im
portance in the East, and after which, 
upon the basis of such ratings, to se
lect the officials for each game. The 
ratings of Carnegie Tech games 
gives us much for elation, for it 
shows beyond a doubt that Carnegie 
Tech, as a football factor is rising 
steadily, and getting more and more 
into the lime-light heretofore held by 
the elitein other words, the Tar
tans are becoming so good that they 
are ranked as a part of that group. 
For instance, the Yale-Carnegie Tech 
game on September 30 was ranked as 
the most important game in the coun
try for that date. Also the Carnegie 
Tech-Wash-Jeff game was ranked as 
the fifth most important. The PlaidPenn State set to received a rating of 
sixth. The Tartans game with No
tre Dame was not ranked because it 
is not an Eastern College. Officials 
were chosen for the 'three games 
rated, but are not yet ready for pub
lication.
Another event of importance sec
ond to none came in Wally,J Steffen 
honoring the school with his presence. 
He arrived Friday morning, and aside 
from taking in all .the events of Cam
pus Week, had a meeting with the 
football boys, and delivered a typi
cal Steffen speech at the Alumni din
ner on Saturday. Without a doubt 
Wally received the biggest hand of 
them all.
His talk was most welcome, and it 
was pleasing indeed to hear his refu
tation of various insinuations, and un
called for attacks upon the collegiate 
athletic world. He deplores the fact 
that a number of sport writers of 
daily papers throughout the country, 
during the lull between winter and 
spring sport seasons see fit to fill 
their columns with abuses of the 
cleanliness of collegiate athletics.
We are glad to hear a man of 
Wallys reputation come out in such 
words. They go down as the words 
of a man who is intimately connected 
with the inside affairs of the matter, 
and are therefore of much more 
weight than the words of a sporting 
writer endeavoring to fill up space,
which, does not meau to hit local 
writelis, but those employed in prac
tically every case by a syndicate.
We, like Wally, and local writers 
believe the game is greater than they, 
and that such scribed only hurt them
selves.
Resume.
During the week only one home 
baseball game was played, but, that 
one game I It was just about as ex
citing as they make 'em. The oue 
game away from homo was lost, but 
even the Pirates and the Giants lose 
once in a while, so what kick do we 
have especially when the team that 
played the best ball won? Grove 
City played errorless ballCarnegie 
erred twiceand hit twice as often, 
and in the pinches, which means 
Grove City had the better pitching.
The victory of the tennis team over 
the Alumni shows that our Varsity 
boys are coming along in great style, 
and acquiring experience necessary 
along with natural ability. The Alum
ni team is a good one. and any team 
that puts over a 7-2 victory on' them 
is a good one also, i Congratulations 
to every single member of the var
sity tennis team. Nice try Alumni 
it is such events as that which 
strengthens the loyalty of Alumni.
Grove City Crimson Nine 
Defeats Plaid Baseballers
'X
Which will next years
captain wear?
I
T DOESNT need much wisdom to predict that 
next years nine will be captained by a 23 
man or maybe a 24 man.
This is no affront to underclassmen. Years of 
steady plugging must go before you can handle the 
man-sized responsibility of running a team.
That this is j ust, seniors will be the first to assert. 
They have seen how well it works for team and col
lege. Then let the seniors keep this point of view, 
for soon they will find how closely the principle 
applies to themselves in the business world.
Captains of industry are not made overnight. 
Don't expect to step into a managership right 
away. Before you can lead, youve got to serve 
in the ranks awhile.
This is best for your organization and best for 
you. The time and energy you put in working up 
from the bottom, taking the bitter with the sweet, 
getting the upperhand over your job, will stand 
you in good stead when you have won through 
to executive position.
AVhen you have learned how to handle detail 
work, you can begin intelligently to direct other 
men to do it, and thus free yourself for creative 
planning.
1 ou who intend to be captains, have patience. 
Your year will come and so will your chance.

Grove City batted their way to a 
clean-cut victory over Carnegie Tech 
Saturday at the grounds of the former. The score was 6 to 2. The 
game was hard and closely contested, 
except in the eighth inning, when the 
score had been tied at two runs each.
The Skibos got their runs in the 
fifth. Mills led with a single and ad
vanced to second on Robertsons sac
rifice. Weiss singled and Mills cross
ed the plate. J. Doherty singled, ad
vancing Weiss, but was thrown out at 
second on a fielders choice, which 
landed R. Doherty on the initial .sack. 
Durkin singled, driving Weiss across 
with the final tally.'1 Godden flied to 
center, ending the stanza.
Carnegie almost scored again in 
the eighth, when, with two out, God
den hit for three bases. Irwin, how
ever, failed to connect safely and was 
out from short to first.
Grove City also scored twice in 
the fifth inning. With one out, Ste 
phanian was hit by a pitched ball. 
Smith doubled, seeding Stephanian 
home. Bible was out from pitcher 
to first base. . Ripper then reached 
first and Smith scored on J. Dohertys 
wild throw to first. Tench was out 
at first.
Nine Grove City men stopped up 
to the plate in the memorable eighth 
and the side was not retired until 
four runs had 'been driven in. Ripper 
led with a single, Tench struck out, 
and Fleming singled. Sellers, drew 
a pass to first, loading the sacks. 
Filer connected isafely, driving in 
Ripper and Fleming. Filer then 
stole fjecond and he and Sellers were 
driven 'home through hits by Lowers 
and Stephanian. Smith was thrown 
out at first and Bible. Hied to left 
field, ending the riot.
The game was important, in that 
it will have a material affect on tho 
Tri-State championship race. Grove 
City College won through better hit
ting, cleaner fielding, and air tight 
pitching.
Weiss deserves much credit for his 
sterling performance on the mound 
for Carnegie. It was the first game 
he had played in since the injury 
to 'his leg, which has kept him on the 
bench nearly the - entire season. The

From Bethany 7-6
Durkin's Hit Saves the Day 
For Carnegie Tech
VARSITY TENNIS TEAM 
EASILY DEFEATS ALUMNI
The heavy rain on Thursday put 
the damper on the Bucknell match 
which was to be played last Friday 
of campus week.
The Alumni team htfd been plan
ning and waiting for this inevitable 
day on which they might take over 
the varsity team. That which had 
promised to be a very closely con
tested match was quickly upset when 
the 1922 team began to chalk up set 
after set, until they had won 7 of 
the 9 matches.
The old time Alumni manager, Ed
die Hirsh, has stated no reasons for 
the overwhelming defeat, but without 
his statements the spectators could 
easily see that the Alumni had been 
short of practice.
The manner in which Toots Davis 
treated Gapt. Duke Nevillfe in the first 
set was almost encouraging enough 
for old boys to let them think that 
they really had the goods to deliver. 
Anyone who understands Dukes play
ing v/ould surely say that he was 
not playing up to snuff, even though 
he did earn the next two sets.
Things didn't work well for Jack 
Beatty in his battle with Connie 
Schwartz. At almost every oppor
tunity, Connie demonstrated how to 
place the ball where Jack wasn't.
Keil played his own easy game and 
won over Steve Stockslager, who 
could do no more than make a good 
showing against a better man at 
singles. This just happened to be
Last Friday afternoon on Carnegie 
Techs diamond, the Tartans succeed
ed in defeating1 the Bethany baseball 
team by the score of 7-6. The field 
was in poor condition to play base
ball, but in order not to disappoint 
the large number of Alumni who 
wished to see the team in action, 
Coach Enos Kirkpatrick decided to 
play the game.
Warwick twirled the entire game 
for the Plaid and pitched excellent 
ball, while Betihany was forced to 
use three pitchers before the game 
was comploted.
Bethany led in the scoring up un
til the seventh inning, when Carnegie 
scored a run making the score 2-2. 
Both teams then scored two runs in 
the next inning and Bethany in the 
first half of the ninth inning scored 
two runs making the score 6-4 in 
their favor.. After two men were 
down Roarke singled and Zook 
doubled giving Bethany one run. El
liot the next' man up singled giving 
Bethany a two run lead and one 
which seemed 'big enough to win the 
game.
In tho last half of this inning 
Prichard was substituted for Ran
dolph and McCaw was sent in by 
Coach Kirkpatrick to pinch hit for 
Mills. Prichard had a delivery 
which seemed to amuse tho large 
crowd which witnessed the game and 
every time that he wound up, the 
crowd gave the Skibo yell. To say 
the least, this continual cheering 
'bothered Prichard and he lost con
trol and walked McCaw. Robertson 
then struck out, but Warwick singled 
scoring McCaw, who had advanced to 
second ibase when Prichard commit
ted a balk. Hcdlund ran for War
wick and Joe and Ray Doherty 
walked filling tho bases. E. Wells 
then took the mound for Bethany 
and after putting two strikes on 
Capt. Durkin tried to slip the third 
one over, but Durkin drove tho ball 
into deep center for a two bagger 
scoring Hcdlund and .Too Doherty and 
winning the game for Carnegie by 
tho score of 7-6.
The support given to both pitchers 
was poor but this was unquestionably 
due to the poor condition of the field.
(Continued on Pago "Four.)
tho alternating time for Coploy to 
trim his opponent, Phil Marshall. 
Phil didn't expect to lose tho third 
set, after having givon Coploy only 
two igamos out of tho second sot.
As far back as tho history of com
bat between Rog. Marshall and Bob 
Schmortz can be traced, not a single 
time have they played that they 
havent had to play off the rubber 
match. In this particular event tho 
two sets were won by Rog only becauso Bob was not used to using those 
musclos which are called upon when 
quick action is demanded.
Whether II. Smith walloped Wolf 
by superior handling of tho racquet 
and by groater ability to place his 
returns or by tho poor playing on 
tho part of oWlf, couldnt bo judged 
in tho one match sinco both men nr 
new to most of tho onlookers.
In past matches tho machine com
posed of Beatty and Stockslager 
never knew what it was like to suffer 
a defeat. But ngw Carnogio Tech 
can boast of a team of doubles that 
can mow em all down. Turn about 
each team won a set, but the toriffic 
speed displayed by Schwartz and 
Neville won them the well deserved 
deuce set.
The combination of Phil Marshall 
and Toots Davis was two much for 
Keil and Copely, but this was not a 
slaughter by any means. The manner 
in which Phil and Toots slowly ap
proached the set was the feature of 
that match.
Bob Schuetz and Wolf cinched the 
third set of their match by a 6-1 score 
and thereby winning the other of the 
two matches for the alumni. Rog 
Marshall and II. Smith captured the 
first set, but they didnt seem to pull 
together at the right time.
All during the matches, Manager 
F. I. Smith had on a perpetual smile, 
for he was all tickled over the out
come.

Mountaineers Hand 
Carnegie 8-1 Defeat
Game Makes it 2 Out of 3 
For West Virginia
The West Virginia Mountaineers 
slugged their way. to an S-l victory 
over tho Tartan baseball team last 
Monday afternoon. Homer Martin, 
the Mountaineer catcher, was the lead
ing hitter for the West Virginians 
collecting three hits, one of them good 
for two bases, in five times at bat. 
Ho also made two spectacular catches 
of high fouls back near the bleach
ers. Aiken, the visiting first base
man, made the prettiest catch of tho 
day, when he took a high fiy off tho 
bat of Harry Durkin in the fourth 
inning and ran over the hank almost 
to the tennis courts in completing it. 
Evans pitched good ball, keeping tho 
hits well scattered except in tho sev
enth inning when two hits and a long 
sacrifice fifty brought in the only run 
for Kirkpatricks boys.
For Carnegie, Joe Doherty was the 
outstanding star, with two hits out 
of four times at bat, and his usual 
brand of good fielding. His error was 
an unavoidable one, and was rather 
more to his credit than against it. 
The bases were full when Widmyer, 
West Virginia left fielder, smashed 
a hot one at Joe, who could not handle 
it quickly enough to make tho play at 
homo and turned and threw to second, 
which was uncovered. Skinny Mc
Caw struck out sbven and handled 
seven assists and one putout. Joe 
Mills, in right field, made a pretty 
catch, and had his hands on tho ball 
at another time, but could not hold 
to it because of the rough condition 
of the ground which kept him oil 
balance.
This game gavo West Virginia tho 
1922 series, two games to one, but 
when tho 1923 season rolls around, 
there should bo a differont story to 
toll.

RAPIDLY DRAWS TO CLOSE
The 1922 season for spring sports 
is rapidly drawing to a close. The 
baso-ball team makes Its last home 
appearance tomorrow, this final gamo 
bolng with the strong Pittsburgh Col
legians. The Collegians hold State to 
a 4-1 score, which when comparing

Tho tennis schedule calls for two 
matches this week and threo next

tomorrow, and Saturday tho team 
travels to West Virginia to play a 
return match tliere. Monday, Alleg
heny is met on tho Allegheny courts. 
Allegheny beat Pitt 4-2. which moans 
that we have to boat Allegheny. 
Tuesday is tho big match of tho sea
son. when Syracuse brings a power
ful team to the Tartan courts. It will 
be recalled that the great Carnegie 
team of 1920, composed of Captain 
Stockslager, Beatty, Marshall, and 
Davis beat Syracuse, that year 
champions of New York State, by1  a 
score of 5-1. If this years varsity can

All our skill, facilities, and lifelong knowledge of 
the finest tobaccos are concentrated 011 this one

Into this ONE BRAND, we put the utmost qual
ity. Nothing is too good for Camels. They are as 
good as its possible to make a cigarette.
Camel QUALITY is always maintained t the 
same high, exclusive standard. You can always 
depend on the same mellow-mild refreshing smooth
nessthe taste and rich flavor of choicest tobaccos 
and entire freedom from cigaretty aftertaste.
And remember this! Camels come in one size 
package only20 cigarettesjust the right size to 
make the greatest saving in production and packing. 
This saving goes straight into Camel Quality. Thats 
iie reason why you can get Camel Quality at so 
moderate a price.
Heres another. We put no useless frills on the 
Camel package. No extra wrappers! Nothingjust for show! ,
Such things do not improve the smoke any more 
than premiums or coupons. And their added cost 
must go onto the price or come out of the quality.
One thingand one onlyis responsible for 
Camels great and growing popularity
That is CAMEL QUALITY.
work and great influence of Carnegie 
Tech men and women. Even in Paris 
he found Carnegie Tech art graduates 
successfully competing with French 
artists.
The introduction of Wally Steffen 
as a speaker was the signal for a 
mighty cheer of welcome, evidence of 
his great popularity. Wally wan
dered back to nine years ago, when 
he first came to Carnegie Tech and 
saw the wonderful opportunity for 
development. Throughout his entire 
regime, Wally has stood for clean 
athletics played, on the square. He 
said, Carnegie Tech occupies a good 
position in the athletic world because 
it is respected by all competitors who 
knowthat we play a clean game and 
that we .play to win. A big tribute 
to our standing in the athletic world 
is shown in the fact that,' without 
solicitation, we were offered games 
by the leading colleges of the coun
try, including Yale, Harvard, Chi
cago, Illinois, Indiana, and Notre 
Dame."
Scotty I-Iondei'son, captain of the 
first Carnegie Tech football team, re
called some of the football games of 
the 1907 season with Pitt and W. 
Va. He expressed a desire that there 
be closer co-operation in the business 
world between Carnegie Tech grad
uates. .
Frank H. Haaren told of the in
creasing prestige of Carnegie Tech in 
the athletic world, evidence of, which 
is shown in the fact that the YaleCnrnegie Tech game on September 
30, 1922, ds ranked as the most im
portant ganio in the country on that 
date.
Fred R. Cogswell, '12, introduced 
two resolutions which had been passed 
by the Alumni Board: first, the elec
tion of Louise W. Oarnegie as the 
first honorary member of the Alumni 
Federation; second, the election as 
honorary members of the Alumni 
Federation of President Iiamerschlag, Col. S. II. Church, Henry 
Hornbostel, William McConway, Tay
lor Allderdice, and John L. Porter. 
These resolutions were carried un
animously.
The Alumni Board will endeavor to 
have Mrs. Carnegie as the honor 
guest for next years banquet. Much 
credit is due to Mr. Tilbroolc and Mr 
Batman for their work in helping to 
make the banquet a successful climax 
for the alumni activities of Campus 
Week.
Mr. Samuel Rea, president of the 
Pennsylvania system, made in part 
the following In reply to inquiries re
garding the value of collegiate prepa
ration in railroad work, in an open 
letter liecently.
The young man graduating from 
college can obtain a foothold In the 
railroad business and advance more 
rapidly than the man who lacks such 
training. In all branches such train
ing is an advantage, and in the exec
utive branches it has become a necssity. Civil and mechanical engineer
ing are the lines that fit men best for 
this work, particularly the former. 
Civil engineers start as rodmen and 
work up through the transportation 
grades. Mechanical engineers start 
as special apprentices in the Altoona 
shops and work up through the motive 
power grades. The need is always 
greater for the transportation men, 
though it is not menat to disparage 
the chances of men who are accepted 
for motive power training. The pres
ent vice president, General W. W. Atterbury is a motive power man, be
ing a graduate of Yale and having 
started as a Bpeclal apprentice at Al
toona.
There should also be a good field 
for college men in the traffic, account
ing and financial departments. Many 
of our present leading traffic officers 
and several in the accounting depart
ments have taken college work, nota
bly economics. There are other de
partments which would interest the 
college manpurchasing, finance,
real estate, legal, and the secretarys 
staff, though in these, a scientific 
training would be of little direct ad
vantage outside of the effect of gen
eral mental development.
Over half of our present officers 
and directors in the Pennsylvania 
System are college graduates. Those 
who have reached the high places 
from the ranks without college train
ing are very few out of a large num
ber of employes, while the larger, 
number of executives have risen 
from a much smaller trained group.
Railroad work could not be rec
ommended to any young man whose 
principal conception of success was 
to become immediately rich. There 
was a time when the business was 
being rapidly promoted and largely 
speculative in character that such a 
prospect held forth. But the specu
lative era has now passed, and the 
work of a railroad officer has become 
one of the most stabilized of the pro
fessions, both from the viewpoint of 
remuneration .and certainty of con
stant employment.
For the young man with a good 
mind, quick brain, sane common 
sense, and thorough training in his 
college, who desires to enter upon L 
life service of great activity and in 
terest, which with capacity, devotion 
and hard work will always pay him a 
satisfactory living, and hold reasona
ble assurances of an excellent salary 
in Ills maturer years, there is little 
that could be more highly recom
mended than a railroad career.
The study of nicknames is always 
interesting, no less in the case of col
leges than with boys. A review of 
the names adopted by the student of 
various colleges reveals neither rhyme 
nor reason.
It is not hard to understand why 
Michigan University students are call
ed Wolverines; those of Wisconsin 
University,, Badgers; of Minnesota, 
Gophers;, of California, Bears; and 
of Oregon, Beavers. These names 
are taken from the animals popular
ly supposed to represent those states.
But why should the students of 
Columbia University be called Lions; 
those of Yale, Bulldogs; of Prince
ton, Tigers; Hastings College, Bron
cos; Yankton College, Greyhounds; 
Williamette UnSversity, Bearcats; 
Grinnel College, Pioneers; Oklahoma 
University, Soon^rs; Iowa State Col
lege, Cyclones; Hamline University, 
Pipers; Wofford College, Terriers; 
Vanderbilt University, Commodores; 
Southern California, Trojans; or 
Florida, Alligators?
The list is not confined to animals. 
Thus the University of South Caro
lina students bear the appellation of 
Gamecocks Nebraska University. 
Cornhuskers; Randolph-Macon, Yel
low Jackets; the University of Rich
mond, Spiders; Ohio State University, 
Buckeyes; Iowa University, Hawkeyes; Indiana University, Hoosiers; 
Kansas, Jay hawks.
There is much duplication. A liasty 
scrutiny reveals the athletes of seven 
colleges calling themselves Bulldogs, 
five going under the title of Tigers, 
and two accepting the cognomen of 
Coyotes.
How would you like to be called 
Pikers, as the students of Washing
ton University, of Tar Heels like 
those of the University of North Caro
lina, or Flickertails like the members 
of the University of North Dakota?
The Singer Pen & Gift Shop in the 
Jenkins Arcade will give you reason
able prices on calling cards, dance 
programs, favors, school pins, rings, 
pillow tops, etc. They can repair your 
old fountain pen or sell you a better 
one.Advertisement.

CAMPUS WEEK WORTH WHILE 
FOR ALL VISITING ALUMNI
Editor of Carnegie Tartan.
Dear Sir: I am certainly glad that 
I came back to dear old Tech for 
these few days and have enjoyed 
every minute of it. At first, I didnt 
think I would attend the alumni 
Luncheon Saturday, as I had other 
plans, but I decided, I would go, and 
now after it is over I wouldnt have 
missed it for anything. The luncheon 
was complete in every detail, and I 
am going to try to get back for Cam
pus Week every year. I met many 
of my old classmates; it was a great 
reunion for me, and I think every 
other Alumnus who was here for 
Campus Week will say the same.
Yours truly,
An Alumnus.
Now some of you Alumni who were 
not here for Campus Week and could 
have been herearen't you sorry you 
weren't? Well, next year is coming, 
so you have another chance.
