Parking Lot Closed;
Bowl Being Filled
The first signs of the multi-million dollar Building and 
Development program are now visible on the Tech Campus, 
with the closing of the Cut parking lot and the filling of 
the Bowl.
TThe campus temporarily lost 147 off-street parking spaces 
when the Cut lot was closed last#
Monday. It became necessary to 
close the lot due to the danger of 
falling debris from the removal 
of the 180,000 cubic yards of 
earth from Withfield hill.
The persons usually parking in 
the Cut lot are advised that 
Were will be about 60 spaces 
bailable on the Edwards prop
erty behind Morewood Gardens.
In addition, parking is allowed on 
Forbes Street until 4:30 p.m., and 
there are now about 50 empty 
spaces in the area between Morewood Avenue and Margaret Mor
rison Street.
Temporary Shortage ^
^The Administration has warnta, however, that the construction 
work now going on will definitely 
cause some temporary parking 
shortage which will have to be 
solved by the students themselves.
The campus now has 957 offstreet parking spaces. The closing 
of the Cut lot reduces this num
ber to 810. However when the de^lopment program is completed, 
many new spaces will be availa
ble.
Complete Grading
The Cut lot will be graded 
along with Withfield Hill until 
it is level with the Cut. When 
the grading is completed the en
tire campus area from the Cut 
to the present softball field will 
be completely level; it will be 
ssible to see the new married 
students dorm from Engineering 
Hall.
The football field will be filled 
to within 15 feet of the level of 
the Cut with 120.000 cubic yards 
of earth from the hill. This will

Essay Contest 
Due Friday
Friday, February 13, is the 
deadline this year for entries in 
the annual H&SS essay contest on 
community and government prob
lems. Entries are to take the 
*m of brief statements support
ed by appended evidence (if 
available).
Prizes in this contest range 
from a first prize of $150 on down. 
Undergraduates in E&S, PM and 
IM may enter. Ent/ies are to be 
submitted to the History Office 
(A.H. 132-A), where further iniwmatioa can be secured.
Carnival Hits 
Midway Snag
Preparations for this years 
Spring Carnival are well under 
way, according to the report of 
the Spring Carnival Committee of 
Student Congress at the last Con
gress meeting, in January.
Lou Pondy, co-chairman of the 
28 member committee, stated that 
although progress has been made 
in most phases of the committees 
work, the proposed early Spring 
ground-breaking for Techs new 
Activities Center will create the 
problem of where to set up the 
midway.
Several alternatives exist for the 
location of the midway, the most 
satisfactory of which is the park
ing lot behind Morewood Gardens 
and part of the adjacent Edwards 
property. The question, however, 
has not yet been definitely set
tled.
A suggestion for placing the 
midway on the IM field was re
jected for many reasons, which 
included the high cost of re-surfacing the field and disturbance to 
private homes on Forbes Street.
In the Spring Carnival report, 
Mr. Pondy also announced that 
two nationally known bands have 
been contracted for the jazz con
cert Friday evening and the Car
nival Ball Saturday evening. He 
would not disclose the names of 
these orchestras, but he has re
cently stated that they figure 
prominently in Playboys 1959 Jazz 
All-Star Poll.

Saturday afternoon from 1 
to 5 p.m. is your last chance 
to join Scotch and Soda. Both 
crew and acting hopefuls 
should report to the girls gym 
to sign up and audition.

President Describes 
Threat To Learning
Potentially the most serious threat to the integrity of 
American higher education, believes Dr. J. C. Warner, 
CIT President, is the extent to which some individuals 
advocate universal higher education as a right of every 
citizen rather than considering it a privilege to be extended

Dean Richard Teare, Jr., of the 
College of Engineering and Sci
ence expressed the purpose of the 
programs: Progress in technology 
in recent years and the develop
ment of new fields have clearly 
demonstrated the need for com
petent and thoroughly trained 
scientists and engineers, especial
ly in positions of leadership.
It is our hope that through 
these programs high school stu

ers will gain a better understand

Kiltie Band To Play 
First Concert Tonight
The Carnegie Tech Pipers, under the direction of Lew 
Davidson, will parade on to the stage of Carnegie Music 
Hall to open the Kiltie Band Concert Season tonight at 8:15.
Attired in their latest style authentic Scotch outfits with 
Mr. George Reynolds on the podium, the band will present 
a program of music which in-#----------------------------------------------------

a fourth year student in the 
school of music, studies under

Committee contacts various agen
cies which might be included in 
the drive. Then, with the help of 
the advisory board which was 
composed of a representative from 
each major organization on cam
pus, the committee decided which 
agencies Campus Chest would in
clude and the percentage of the 
collected funds which each would 
receive.
Sixty-five per cent of the Cam
pus Chest dollar is spent for stu
dent services, twenty per cent for 
social services and fifteen per 
cent for medical services. The 
committee arranges to have one

of each student.
in intellectual capacity.1
Strong pressures have develop
ed for relaxing scholastic stand
ards so that more students can 
graduate. Unfortunately, these 
pressures on the whole American 
educational system have been 
magnified since Sputnik sailed in
to the skies.
Dr. Warner sees higher educa
tion as a privilege to be granted 
to those students of ability with 
the ambition to learn. He cautions 
that, we cannot afford to tailor 
all of our higher education to the 
needs of the average student. The 
average student seldom is re
sponsible for the great break 
throughs.
Superior Students
There are, of coui'se, fewr 
geniuses, Dr. Warner noted, but
su
perior ability who can make out
standing contributions to our futui'e. We must continue to provide 
some few institutions where these 
superior students can find the 
stimulation they need.
In his 55th Annual Report for 
the Academic Year of 1957-58, 
just released January 31, he as
serts that Carnegie Tech intends 
[to be that kind of institution with 
these objectives: (1) to educate 
gifted young men and women for 
positions of leadership in the pro
fessions and in society, (2) to 
serve as a center of learning 
where new knowledge and new 
ideas result from research and 
other scholarly-creative activi
ties.
Dr. Warner recognizes that this 
is not an easy task, even though 
the basic precepts of good higher 
education have been long estab
lished.
82 Graduates 
Get Diplomas
On January 31, in the largest 
mid-year graduation in the his
tory of Tech, eighty-two degrees 
were conferred in the theater of 
the College of Fine Arts.
President John C. Warner 
awarded forty-three bachelors, 
twenty-eight masters, and eleven 
doctor of philosophy degrees to 
candidates from the Colleges of 
Engineering and Science, Mar
garet Morrison, Fine Arts, The 
School of Printing Management, 
and the Division of Humanistic 
and Social Studies.

Next Tuesday
Techs annual English depart
ment assembly series begins next 
Tuesday, February 17, with a lec
ture entitled Stendhal by Dr. 
William M. Schutte, associate 
professor of English.
Literary Masters of the Nine
teenth Century is the theme of 
the first four programs. The entire 
series will be presented during 
the assembly hour, 11:30, in the 
Fine Arts Theatre and will be 
open to all of the Tech com
munity.
The ensuing three lectures in
clude:
February 24: Dickens, by
Professor Austin Wright, head of 
the English department.
March 3: Poe, by Mr. Earle 
R. Swank, assistant professor of 
English.
March 10: Tolstoy, by Mr. 
Edward A. Tainor, instructor in 
English.
March 17, in the fifth and final 
lecture of the 1959 series, Dr. 
Donald M. Goodfellow, associate 
professor of English, will discuss 
Shakespeares Loves Labours 
Lost, which will be produced 
later this year by the Tech drama 
department.
The department of English 
committee planing the series is 
composed of Professors John A. 
Hart, chairman, Robert C. Slack, 
and A Fred Sochatoff.
Carnegie Tech 
Hosts Writers
Approximately 165 practicing 
engineers and scientists gathered 
on the Carnegie Tech campus for 
the Second Annual Institute of 
Technical Writing and Editing on 
Friday and Saturday, January 30 
and 31.
The Institute, which is sponsored 
jointly by the department of gen
eral studies, Margaret Morrison 
Carnegie College, and the Pitts
burgh Chapter of the Society of 
Technical Writers and Editors, of
fers instruction in the basic con
cepts of language and communica
tion and their application to tech
nical writing.
Talks
College and university professors 
spoke and led discussions on the 
principles of language and com
munication while professional 
writers from industry devoted 
their time to the application of 
these principles to technical writng. In addition to these talks, 
there were workshops in which 
many areas of the technical writ
ing and editing field were ex
plored.
The Technical Writing Institute 
was initiated last year as part of 
a plan by the Pittsburgh Chapter 
STWE and Margaret Morrison 
Carnegie College designed to pro
vide professional instruction for 
the engineers and scientists who 
are being called upon to do more 
and more writing.
Math Professors 
Visit High Schools 
To Plan Curricula
A team of mathematics profes
sors from Carnegie Tech has been 
engaged recently as curricular 
consultants by the Baldwin-Whitehall School District.
Professors John Neelley, Richard 
A. Moore, and Allen F. Strehler, 
the committees chairman will as
sist in surveying the problem of 
high school mathematics in rela
tion to college programs. The con
sulting project is one of the first 
of its kind in the district.
Modern Curriculum
A strong and continually modem 
curriculum to best meet the needs 
of both the students who go on 
to college and those who do not 
is the goal of the program. The 
school district hopes that this sur
vey will also serve as a pilot 
experiment for similar collegein solutions to the problems pre
sented her in these letters.
Seek Introduction
Dear Polly,
I am a freshman math major. A 
certain girl sits in front of me 
in history class and I would like 
to date her. My problem is that 
I went to an all boys school and 
this is my first experience with 
co-education. What approach 
should I use to make her acquaint
ance?
M.N.

district coordinated programs in 
the sciences.
The Tech professors meet each 
week at Baldwin with the second
ary school mathematics teachers 
to discuss the merits and disad
vantages of the present high school 
curriculum. Current developments 
in mathematics are brought forth 
with a view to revising and aug
menting the course of study.
Recommendations
The survey group considers re
commendations of such national 
organizations as the commission on 
mathematics of the College Exam
ination Board.
The program has been initiated 
by Dr. W. Robert Paynter, super
vising principal at Baldwin-Whitehall. In commenting on the pro
gram Dr. Paynter said, ...not 
only are present courses and sub
jects in high school mathematics 
in ned of considerable revision, 
but the very concepts and rela
tionships of mathematics have un
dergone important evolutions over 
the years. Areas of emphasis have 
changed. Present day teachers of 
mathematics need to be aware of 
the changes so that they may, at 
the earliest possible moment, ad
just their teaching to them.
The participating professors 
from Carnegie are members of the 
Universitys mathematics educa
tion committee. This committee 
has for some time been studying 
the relations between high school 
and college mathematics educa
tion.
Im very easy to get along with 
and not bad looking yet there I 
sit wreek after week watching 
people coming and going. It 
wouldnt be so bad if I got some 
work done, but I dont. I just sit 
there and wonder why its not me 
out there with the rest of the 
group.
Some people say that Im getting 
a little heavy. They even call me 
hips. But a few pounds certain
ly shouldnt make that much a 
difference in a boys attitude 
toward me. Please help me with 
my problem because Im getting 
so lonely.

Under The Baton 
Of Pierre Monteux
Pierre Monteux, a seemingly 
indestructible pillar of world 
music, lifts his baton over the 
Pittsburgh Sympohny Orchestra 
at Pittsburghs Syria Mosque 
February 13 and 15 and the pres
ent generation will have a happy 
look at a man who was making 
music before the Wright Brothers

for the first time in his glittering 
career next wreek.
Amazing Schedule
Despite his advancing years, 
Monteux keeps up an amazing 
schedule of continent-hopping to 
conduct both opera and concerts. 
His zest for life is legendary and 
his work on stage with a sym
phony orchestra is an exciting and 
memorable experience for an 
audience.
In his two appearances with 
the Pittsburgh Symphony Friday 
evening, February 13 and Sunday 
afternoon, February 15, Monteux

Crews
Even more positions are open 
to those interested in crew work. 
You can sign up for the follow

construction, costume, make-up, 
and publicity. This is an excel
lent way to learn about the the
ater and develop your skills in 
these fields.
Everyone in the school, except 
freshman dramats, are eligible for 
membership in Scotch and Soda. 
Scholastic standing will not be 
considered, and engineering and 
Maggie Murph students are urg
ed to try for a bigger turn out this 
year.
Success Assured 
Set Em Up Again promises 
to be quite successful this year 
because key positions are held by 
experienced, past members. Jim 
De Blasis and Ron Barron are co
directors, and theyve come up 
with many new, orgininal ideas.

of time.
The company, at a meeting held 
recently at the Webster Hall Hotel 
told those in attendance which in

Presently, the spokesman for 
the company said, we average 
approximately 2.5 passengers each

Explorers Club 
Plans Trips
Anyone who has t>een in Skibo 
early Sunday mornings this year, 
has probably noticed a lot of bri^ t 
red hats running around. Chances 
are that the people under these 
hats are members of the Carnegie' 
Tech Explorers Club, on their way 
out for a day of hiking, rock 
climbing, or cave exploring.
An outgrowth of the rock climb
ing schools held by the Explorers 
Club of Pittsburgh, the Tech Ex
plorers Club came into formal ex
istence just last fall. Since tKen 
it has had a busy schedule of 
activities, with a field trip almost 
every weekend and extended trips 
during vacations. Number of parti
cipants in field trips has averaged 
ten to twenty.
Fingertip Climbs
Typical rock-climbing trips take 
the club to White Rocks, near 
Uniontown, or High Rocks, near 
Derry. A short hike along wooded 
trails on the western slope "of 
Chestnut Ridge leads to the climb
ing areas. A wide variety of climb
ing is available, ranging from easy 
scrambles on slopes to fingertip 
climbs on vertical faces, which 
challenge even the most experi
enced climbers.
As in all the Explorers Clubs 
activities, safety is a paramount 
consideration in climbing. If there 
is any possibility of injury in cgse 
of a fall, the climber is required 
to use a safety rope, which is held 
above him by a competent belayer. 
With such safety measures, rock 
climbing is probably considerably 
safer than trying to cross Forbes 
Ave. at 8:25 a.m.
Explore Caves
Local caves explored this year 
have included Dulanys, Lemon I 
Hole, and Copperhead Cave. Cav
ers usually use carbide lamps, j^d 
wear miners hard hats to prevent 
bumped heads on low ceilings. 
Balls of string are used only on 
television and in the movies.
Weekends not occupied by 
climbing or caving have been tak
en up by hiking and camping, 
usually on the wooded slopes of 
Chestnut Ridge. Members are in
formed of future events by a bi
weekly newspaper, The Tech Ex
plorer, which also publishes im
ports of past field trips.
Club Projects
More ambitious club projects 
have included climbing West Vir
ginias Seneca Rock, which soars 
1000 feet above the valley floor 
below, and activity in the big 
cave country of West Virginia. 
Caves explored there include 
Swago Pit, Hellhole, Elkhorn 
Mountain Cave, and Schoolhou.se, 
perhaps the most famous 
toughest cave in the eastern Unit
ed States.
Newcomers are always welcome 
in the Explorers Club, and mem
bers state emphatically that it is 
definitely a co-ed organization. No , 
previous experience is necessary; 
one of the purposes of the club 
is to help those 'who want to learn 
about climbing, caving, camping, 
and related activities.
Plans for the spring semeS/^r 
include a rock-climbing school for 
beginners, a canoe trip on Cheat 
River, a hike on the Baker Trail, 
and climbing on Seneca Rocks, in 
addition to local climbing and cav
ing trips. Some members are al
ready planning for next summers 
mountaineering and hiking in 
areas such as the Grand Tetons, 
the Sierra Nevada, and possibly 
even the St. Elias Range in Alaska.

Brotherhood Week
The National Conference of Christians 
and Jews is sponsoring National Brotherhood 
Week February 15-22, reminding us that 
brotherhood has attracted mankind for ages 
and yet it has eluded him.*
Here on the Tech campus, we have a 
rather pleasant mixture of many nationali
ties, religions, and races. However, there is 
no room for complacency. For it is not 
enough to agree with the principles of broth
erhood; not enough to preach about it. Broth
erhood must be lived. As Faith Baldwin has 
put it, Until we learn to live our own lives, 
practice our own customs and religions and 
grant this birthright to everyone else, we are 
getting nowhere fast!
Cornelia Skinner advises that when you 
find yourself hating someone to ask the ques
tion, What am I afraid of? George Bernard 
Shaw supplies one answer to this question 
when he wrote, Hatred is the cowards re
venge for being intimidated. Hatred is so 
often a cowardly disguise for weakness.

Toasts Wanted
Editor, the Tartan;
For the past several years I 
have been collecting toasts, in 
English and many other languages, 
with the intention of publishing a 
comprehensive book of the collec

ly good, I feel I dont have enough 
which reflect our contemporary 
mores. I would like to ask the 
readers of the Carnegie Tartan if 
they have any toasts of any de
scription which they would like 
to share. For any such toasts which 
are included in this collection, I 
will be pleased to send a compli

published. Please send yours to:

In answer to a persons question, 
What has San Francisco got that

This city is downright ill. I 
come from that scintilating, exBarbary Coast, gay San Francisco. 
By the way, Dont call it Frisco. 
We have hills like Rome. A sky
scraper-studded financial district 
with the bustling urgency of Manhatten. A magnificent bay that 
ranks with Naples and rivals the 
glamour of Hong Kongs. Boule

Congress Seeks 
New Definition 
For Supreme Court
By Terrie Rudy
'What does the student body 
think about the. present powers 
of the Supreme Court of Student 
Congress? This is what the con
stitution committee would like to 
know. The committee is in the 
process of revising the Student 
Congress consittution to definitely 
define the powers of the court.
Court Powers 
The powers of the court as 
stated in the constitution are: 
Hold jurisdiction in all cases in
volving infractions of the law of 
this government; decide as to the 
constitutionality of the acts of the 
other two branches of the govern
ment in cases of dispute; act as a 
final student court of appeal in 
cases where original jurisdiction 
resides in another student court; 
hold original jurisdiction in cases 
of infraction of both the laws of 
the Student Government and a 
lesser governing body; have the 
power, if it finds an organization 
guilty, to: 1. revoke the organi
zations charter or suspend the 
charter if the Student Congress 
has the power to grant such a 
charter, 2. suspend the social 
privileges of the group for a time 
speciled by the Supreme Court, 3. 
Limit the organizations normal 
pattern of operation as determin
ed by the Supreme Court, 4. Fine 
the organizations any costs; and 
have the power, if it finds an in 
dividual guilty, to: 1. place the 
individual on social probation, 2. 
require a probationary period of 
the person from any organization,
3. recommend to the schools 
Committee on Discipline that the

The words conformity and Knon-conformity are becoming almost as popular to 
the lay-person as the words sex, Freud, and 
Coca-Cola, but few people consider why 
they conform or whether it is or is not neces
sary. It is simpler merely to comply.
' The General Electric Review has defined 
conformity as blind, uncritical acceptance oi 
beliefs and choices in the absence of convic
tion based on evidence and logical grounds. 
It can be easily seen in ones early life that 
conformity involves little of the thought 
process, since one identifies himself with his 
parents, his peers, or a group, and conforms 
to their expections to avoid disapproval and 
hence anxiety. This is not a very selective 
process, however, we must conform to a d^ 
gree since the security of society depends
? on the observing of laws, customs, and com
mon courtesies. Some people, of course, revolt against the 
unnatural standards sometimes imposed by the group, in
stitution, or society; but even they are not really free of the 
bonds of conformity. Usually their rebellion is just as rig
idly patterned as the behavior they rebell against. Notable 
examples are the beats and people in our own drama de
partment. , A drama student who attended class in suit an@ 
tie would be the exception rather than the rule. A cartoon 
caption comments on this adroitly in exclaiming, Why cant 
you be a non-conformist like everyone else? The only way 
complete non-conformity is possible is to return to the stone 
age, and then remain isolated and celebrate.
Most assuredly conformity is no panacea. Rigid con
formity, especially rigid intellectual conformity, inhibits 
creativity, stifles spontaneity, negates personal freedom, and 
fosters inflexibility of thought. The group is by no meailti 
always right. The history of science, in particular, time and 
time again shows the best thinking of many experts proved 
wrong by a dissenting individual ... a non-conformist. Our 
world, constantly evolving economically, politically, physi
cally, and technologically, necessitates ascertain amount of 
flexibility for continuance of life as we know it.
What of this apparent paradox, this necessity for both 
conformity and non-conformity? A simple, feasible soli^ 
tion would be conformity in relatively minor actions such 
as obeying traffic laws, wearing clothes in the summer, and 
bathing several times a week; and non-conformity in such 
things as supporting beliefs and ideals based on logical 
grounds and maintaining creativity. If the drama student 
can better prepare himself for a role by growing a beard 
and speaking only in a New England dialect, then it would 
certainly be justifiable for him to non-conform in these r^ 
spects. If an engineer or physicist had logical evidence to 
refute existing atom theory, he would be justified in pro
claiming and maintaining his theory. An artist would be 
justified in ignoring the works of his predecessors in creat
ing that of his own. This is non-conformity with a purpase. 
It hardly seems worth the effort to oppose soceity in all the 
everyday, relatively non-essential matters, for it is difficult 
enough to oppose society in maintaining ones conviction 
and beliefs. Machiavelli was aware of this in saying, . . 
there is nothing more difficult to carry out, nor more doubt
ful of success, nor more dangerous to handle, than to initiate 
a new order of things. For the reformer (the non-conform
ist) has enemies in all those who profit by the old order, 
and only lukewarm defenders in all those who would profit 
by the new order, this lukewarmness arising partly from 
fear of their adversaries, who have the laws in their favq^ 
and partly from the incredulity of mankind, who do not 
truly believe in anything new until they have had actual
experience of it.Blenheim.
probationary suspension, 4. Fine

Chairman Ralph Hise of the 
constitution committee would like 
anyone who has suggestions pertaining to the revision and defini
tion of these powers to contact 
him by phone at MUseum 1-8768

Regional Study 
jieing Conducted
Three Pittsburgh  organizations 
have joined forces to bring a top 
regional economist to the com
munity to direct an economic 
study of the area and to teach in 
two Pittsburgh universities, as 
announced last week by the Pitts
burgh Regional Planning Associa
tion.
Dr. Edgar M. Hoover of Bel
mont, Massachusetts has been ap
pointed director of the regional 
economic study to be conducted 
by the Pittsburgh Regional Plan
ning Association, professor of eco
nomics at the University of Pitts
burgh and lecturer in economics 
at the CIT Graduate School of In
dustrial Administration. His ap
pointment by the planning associa
tion was effective February 1, 1959. 
Dr. Hoover is presently visiting
rofessor of economics at Har
old University and associated 
with the New York Metropolitan 
Region Study.
Valuable Information
Commenting on the appointment 
of Dr. Hoover, William H. Rea, 
president of the Pittsburgh Re
gional Planning Association said, 
 We are extremely pleased that 
Dr. Hoover has agreed to under
take this important project that 
puld provide a wealth of valuae economic information for the 
future development of this region.
Dr. Hoovrs acceptance, he 
continued, marks a successful 
conclusion to the first phase of 
the noteworthy cooperative effort 
between representatives of Pitt, 
Tech, the Regional Industrial Developkment Corporation and the 
Pittsburgh Regional Planning As
sociation which will be continuedf
oughout the regional economic 
dy.
$400,000 in Grants
The 3-year, $400,000 compre
hensive study of the economy of 
the Pittsburgh region which Dr. 
Hoover will direct has been made 
possible through a $200,000 grant 
from the Ford Foundation and a 
matching $200,000 grant from the 
Regional Industrial Development 
Corporation. These grants were 
announced last September at the 
annual dinner meeting of the Al
legheny Conference on Commu
nity Development.

IS STUDYING NECESSARY?
Once there were three roommates and their names were Walter 
Pellucid, Casimir Fing, and LeRoy Holocaust and they were all 
taking English lit. They were all happy, friendly, outgoing 
types and they all smoked Philip Morris Cigarettes as you 
would expect from such a gregarious trio, for Philip Morris is 
the very essence of sociability, the very spirit of amity, the very 
soul of concord, with its tobacco so mild and true, its packs so 
soft and flip-top, its length so regular or long size. You will 
find when you smoke Philip Morris that the birds sing for you 
and no man's hand is raised against you.
Each night after dinner Walter and Casimir and LeRoy went 
to their room and studied English lit. For three hours they sat 
in sombre silence and pored over their books and then, squinty 
and spent, they toppled onto their pallets and sobbed them
selves to sleep.
This joyless situation obtained all through September and 
October. Then one November night they were all simultane
ously struck by a marvelous idea. We are all studying the same 
thing, they cried. Why, then, should each of us study for 
three hours? Why not each study for one hour? It is true we 
will only learn one-third as much that way, but it does not 
matter because there are three of us and next January before 
the exams, we can get together and pool our knowledge!'
Oh, what rapture then fell on Walter and Casimir and LeRoy! 
They flung their beanies into the air and danced a schottische 
and lit thirty or forty Philip Morrises and ran out to pursue 
the pleasure which had so long, so bitterly, been missing from 
their lives.
Alas, thej' found instead a series of grisly misfortunes. Walter, 
alas, went searching for love and was soon going steady with a 
coed named Invicta Breadstuff, a handsome lass, but, alas, 
hopelessly addicted to bowling. Each night she bowled five 
hundred lines, some nights a thousand. Poor Walters thumb 
was a shambles and his purse was empty, but Invicta just kept 
on bowling and in the end, alas, she left Walter for a pin-setter, 
which was a terrible thing to do to Walter, especially in this 
case, because the pin-setter was automatic.
Walter, of course, wras far too distraught to study his English 
lit, but he took some comfort from the fact that his room
mates were studying and they would help him before the exams. 
But Walter, alas, was wrong. His roommates, Casimir and 
LeRoy, were nature lovers and they used their free time to go 
for long tramps in the woods. One November night, alas, 
they were treed by two bears, Casimir by a brown bear and 
LeRoy by a K&diak, and they were kept in the trees until midJanuary when winter set in and the brown bear and the Kodiak 
went awray to hibernate.
So when the three roommates met before exams to pool 
their knowledge, they found they had none to pool! Well sir, 
they had a good long laugh about that and then rushed to the 
kitchen and stuck their heads in the oven. It was, however, an 
electric oven and the effects were, on the whole, beneficial. The 
wax in their ears got melted and they acquired a healthy tan 
and today they are married to a lovely young heiress named 
Ganglia Bran and live in the Canal Zone, where there are manjr 
nice boats to wave at.  shuh^-
And heres a wave at you filter smokern. Have you tried

IM Bowling 
Gets Underway
As the first semester came to a 
close, the intramural bowling 
teams were halfway through their 
schedules. However, the first two 
teams in each of the two leagues 
were way ahead of the other 
also-rans in the leagues.
In the Strikes League, a strong 
DU team was one point ahead of 
the well balanced printing man
agement team. Three teams were 
battling for third place, but all 
were a far distance behind the 
two leaders. The three teams 
were ATO, BSR, and DTD.
Undefeated Sigma Nu
The only undefeated team in 
either league as last years run
ners-up, Sigma Nu. However, they 
also only led the second place 
team in the Spares League, Obe
lisk A,, by one point. The dorm 
team boys are the defending 
champs of last year. SAE was 
ahead of the rest of the pack in 
third place, but far behind the 
other two powers.
Obelisk A has the high three 
game total with 2443 pins, while 
the Phi Kaps have the high one 
game total with 889 pins. The 
three top bowlers for both leagues 
were Ira Shapiro, Pete Bruno, 
and Bob Marik. All are averag
ing better than 170 pins per game. 
The three high individual games 
so far are Fred Smiths 235, 
Brunos 233, and Walt Shan
nons 217. The three fellows who 
have the high for a three game 
series are Shapiro with 580, Shan
non with 568, and Frank Drake 
with 543.
IM Basketball
At Seasons Peak; 
Teams Matched
Although only a few games 
have been played so far, three 
teams seem to be sure bets to win 
their leagues in intramural bask
etball. The other two leagues are 
going to have hard fought stru^ 
gles between three teams in eacnT
The Englishmen have just about 
clinched the top spot in the Hook 
Shot league. The Kappa Sigs may 
have trouble with the Delts, but, 
nevertheless, should easily win 
their league. The Falcons appear 
to have won their league; al
though Mike Flynn almost singlehandedly beat them. Flynn scor
ed 37 points in a losing cause as 
the Falcons won 47-45 in ovetu 
time.
Long Shot
The Long Shot league is a tossup between TKN, ATO, and 
BTP. TKN barely defeated the 
Betas, 21-20; however, Marty 
Poad scored 17 points for the in
dependents. Last night the Betas 
played the Alpha Taus, but their 
score will not be available until 
next week. The Met Grads, Tau 
Delts, and Sigma Nus are having 
similar squirmishes in the Set 
Shot league.
The best individual perform
ances so far were by Mike Flynn, 
who scored over 70 points in two 
games, and three freshman foot
ballers, Marty Poad, Otto Leone, 
and Pete Bouxsein. The three fel
lows who were not mentioned in 
the MVP candidates list last issue 
were all Falcons  Jim Trageser, 
Ed Horey, and Kemp Beall.

Tech Upsets Geneva; 
Ends Losing Streak
Going into Saturday nights home contest with Geneva, 
the once winning Tartans had dropped seven straight. Their 
streak included losses to Pitt (82-75), Duquesne (76-55), West
minster (81-53), and Slippery Hock (92-83). The streak started
with a loss to Geneva back on* 
January 10, 81-71.
Coming out of Saturday nigh/s 
match the Tartans stopped that 
ftreak by beating the very same 
Geneva team before a semi-filled 
gym, 72-69.
In the first half Tech led by 
as many as 11 points, but just 
managed to hold on to a 2 point 
lead at the recess. Geneva kept 
on to a 2 point lead at the re
cess. Geneva kept on the Tartans 
tails throughout the second half, 
too, with the lead exchanging 
hands ten iimes.
However, with a few crucial 
baskets by Komer and Sofia, Tech 
managed to pull out ahead by 3 
points (68-65) with two minutes 
left and never trailed from there.
Tremendous Comeback
The Tartans led throughout the 
entire first half, and were leading 
(30-21) with still 5 minutes to go 
in the period. From this point the 
strong Geneva offense led by 
Schena and Yancy out-scored 
Tech 10 to 3 in the ensuing min
utes and cut the Tartan lead to 
a lone basket at halftime.
Tech was quick to score to 
start the second half, but Geneva 
was quicker to come back and 
tied the game for the first time 
(39-39). The teams matched buck
ets as neither side was able to 
build up more than a 3 point lead. 
Then with the score knotted at 
65 apiece, Komer drove in, made 
the basket, and was fouled.
He hit the free throw and put 
Tech ahead for the rest of the 
game. Genevas final bid to win 
was foiled and Tech won (72-69).

New IM Trophy 
To Be Awarded 
For Coming Year
Something new has been added 
to encourage team performances 
in intramural sports. A trophy 
which is about knee high to Wilt 
The Stilt, will be given to the 
organization which is considered 
to have been tops on campus this 
past year.
The winner will be determined 
by a point basis. Sports are clas
sified under three divisions 
major, intermediate, and minor. 
Points are given as follows:

Fourth.. 21
In futureyears,but notthis
year, 10 points may be given to 
any organization which enters a 
team in every sport.
Major Sports
The major sports, which are 
designated in the IM Constitution, 
are football, volleyball, basket
ball, bowling, and softball. The 
minor sports, those with less than 
90 individuals participating, are 
wrestling, co - rec badminton, 
handball, chess, and horseshoes.
The intermediate sports, which 
can never become' major sports, 
are those with 90 or more indi
viduals participating. This means 
that a minor sport which sudden
ly has 90 or more participants can 
move into the higher division, 
while the intermediate sport 
sport which drops in membership 
can drop into the lower division.
Intermediates
The sports which are consider
ed to be intermediates are soccer, 
track, swimming, rifle, foul-shoot
ing, co-rec volleyball, water polo, 
table tennis, and team bridge.

Start Workouts 
for 59 Season
Carnegie Techs 1959 varsity 
track team began practice sessions 
last Friday in the Skibo gym un
der the direction of coach Richard 
Uhl Swaney.
^Sprinters and field events men 
will drill indoors during Febru
ary, moving outdoors when the 
weather clears. Distance men, 
however, are already braving the 
elements as they carry out daily 
drills in Schenley Park (afternoon 
drills).
Due to construction work being 
carried on in the Tech Bowl, all 
outdoor practices and meets will 
be held at Schenley Oval Track 
M>urse.
 Early Start
Returning veterans and fresh
men alike are urged to begin 
training early, as 1959 competition 
jn the West Penn Conference 
promises to be extremely keen. 
A good record in track is needed 
to help Tech in its bid to continue 
as all sports champion for the 
second straight year.
All men interested in competi
tion for a place on the team 
IRould contact Coach Swaney as 
soon as possible (available Mon
day, Wednesday, and Friday at 
4:30 in the Gym.) Check with the 
athletic office for further details. 
Every position on the team is 
open, so potential applicants are 
urged to contact Coach Swaney.
Swaney Named 
As Track Coach 
For 59 Harrier
Richard Uhl Swaney, ex 
track and cross country star from 
Tech has been named track coach 
for the coming season by Director 
of Athletics Mel Cratsley.
Swaney graduated from Tech in 
1957 in the depaitment of Metal
lurgy and is presently employed 
by the Allegheny Ludlum Steel 
Corporation. He recently served a 
6-months tour of duty in the U. 
S. Army.
Uhl won four varsity letters in 
track while at Tech in his spe
cialty the 440-yard dash. He also 
ran the 100 and 220 yard dashes 
and was anchor man on the mile 
relay team.
440 Champion
In 1950 he was Tri-State 440 
champion, anchor man on Techs 
Tri-state championship relay 
team, and high point man for 
Tech during the season. His team
mates voted him the most valu
able man on the squad for that 
year.
This will be Swaneys first sea
son as track mentor although he 
handled the coaching chores for 
the 1957 cross country squad. He 
will be seeking to better last 
years 5-4 seasons record.
Learning
[continued from page 2] 
come to us we shall go forward. 
During the academic year of 
1957-58, several innovations have 
been made in the curricula. It is 
felt that these improvements of
fer Carnegie students a better 
and more complete program of 
learning. A new advanced course, 
Science of Materials for Elec
trical Engineers is being offered 
by the metallurgical engineering 
department. A new undergradu
ate curriculum in mechanical en
gineering was put into effect, and 
the department of civil engineer
ing is considering plans for re
vising their curriculum.
In response to a request from 
industry, an acceleration of the 
degree program in evening classes 
has been planned and approved 
for students in electrical and me
chanical engineering.
Summer Programs 
The first two years of the 
architecture program have been 
largely revised, and a new 
graphic option in painting, design, 
and sculpture is producing good 
results. New summer programs 
in art and music were introduced 
for pre-college students, and more 
extensive courses offered for art 
teachers.
One of the more interesting 
curricula changes is a new English 
composition program. On an ex
perimental basis, the same com
position course was taught to 
classes consisting of students en
rolled in E & S, architecture, in
dustrial management, printing 
management, and Margaret Mor
rison.
Spring Has Sprung
Barney Seigle, Techs 15 ft. pole vaulter starts workouts for the 
coining season.
Tech Rifle Teami
temains Unbeaten 
n Conference
The Carnegie Tech Varsity Rifle 
Team is beginning to show some 
of its strength. The team broke 
the record for the highest team 
score in the Greater Pittsburgh 
Rifle League as they posted a 1429 
to down Duquesne Universitys 
1360. Until now the league record 
of 1428 was held by West Vir
ginia University.
Even this score does not fully 
demonstrate the teams great po
tential. This potential has been 
apparent several times this season 
when in the inter-squad matches, 
fired weekly by two teams made 
up entirely of squad members, 
both teams have totaled well over 
1410 and the overall five top 
scores have totaled well over 
1420. As yet, however, the team 
%iembers have not all been able 
to fire their top scores in one 
match.
The five shooters whose scores 
made up the 1429 were Vic Polansky 290, Ben Freudenreich 288, 
Bill Harris 286, John Jenkins 283, 
and Bill Houck 282. This win 
brings the teams record to 5 wins 
and 1 loss in the G.P.R.L. and 4 
wins and no losses in the West 
^enn Conference.
Intramural
Highlights
Call poll play-offs will begin in 
two weeks. The top seven players 
are Sam Kiss, Ed Guerdan, Tony 
De Chicchis, Dan Maruca, Steve 
Tomko, Joe Martin, and Don Luff. 
One of the first three is expected 
to win.
On Thursday ATO B plays 
ATO A at 7:00 in the water 
polo semi-finals, while BTP plays 
BSR at 8:00. The loser will play 
off the consolation game at 7:00 
next Thursday, while the winners 
will play for the championship at 
8:00. The Betas, led by John Crecine and goalie Joe Oldfield, up
set the defending champs, ATO 
A, in league play and, there
fore, are the favorite.
Out of the four bridge leagues 
only the Whiz Kids and the Grad 
Jacks have won their leagues. The 
defending champs, the Whiz Kids, 
are expected to be champs again.
The winners of the table tennis 
leaguesGiants, Bears, and Steelersare the Newman Club, the 
Obelisks, the BSR, respectively. 
Those in second place are, re
spectively, TDP, the Grads, and 
BTP. Tournament play begins this 
week.
World Prayer Day 
To Be Observed 
At Chatham
On Tuesday evening, February 
17, at 7:00, World Day of Prayer 
for Students will be observed 
with a prayer service sponsored 
by the World Student Christian

Tech Gets Sculpture 
Done By Henry Moore
The department of fine arts of Carnegie Institute an
nounces its grateful acceptance of the gift of a major work of 
art from the 1958 Bicentennial International.
This is Henry Moores Reclining Figure, the second prize 
in sculpture. This bronze is given4-----------------------------------------------------
in memory of the late David 
Thompson, by Mr. and Mrs. G. 
David Thompson of Brownsville 
Road, Pittsburgh. Mr. Thompson, 
the well-known Pittsburgh col
lector, in making this donation 
has noted that he would prefer to 
give the Institute this notable 
work of art, in memory of David, 
than to place a monument in a 
cemetery. His son was killed last 
May in an automobile accident in 
California while serving in the 
armed forces.
Recent Work
One of the most recent works of 
the world famous British sculptor, 
Henry Moore, Reclining Figure, 
is one of six casts of the big 
model that was made in prepara
tion for the still larger version in 
Carrara marble that decorates an 
entrance to the new Unesco 
Building in Paris. This undertak
ing was commissioned by Unesco 
along with other artistic projects 
that have included a garden by 
Noguchi, a mobile by Calder, and 
murals by such renowned artists 
as Miro, Picasso, Tamayo, Afro 
and Appel.
Reclining Figure was borrow
ed for Carnegie Institute directly 
from the studio of Henry Moore 
near London. Gordon Washburn 
who obtained it, was the first per
son to purchase a sculpture by 
Henry Moore for an American 
Museum  a smaller reclining 
figure in wood which was bought 
for the Allbright Art Gallery of 
Buffalo in 1939. On this later oc
casion, Henry Moore told the 
Carnegie art director that he had 
made several models for the Un
esco project before reaching his 
final inspiration.
Although all of them are re
markable, says Mr. Washburn,
Interested in 
having your typing 
done for you?
Call WE. 1-2271
by returning to his old theme of 
a reclining female figure, Moore 
has clearly outdone himself. This 
is his noblest version of a sculp
tural idea that has clearly repeat
ed itself in various marvelous 
forms during his lifetime.
First Major Sculpture
In receiving Henry Moores 
great bronze, the department of 
fine arts is the recipient of its 
first major original sculpture. It 
hopes that this magnificent mem
orial by one of the leading sculp
tors of the twentieth century, may 
form a nucleus for a whole col
lection of original pieces, the gift 
of other generous donors of the 
community. The Reclining Figure 
will be placed in Sculpture Court 
at the close of the Interantional.
Henry Moore was born in 
Casleford, England, 1898, the son 
of a miner. Lives in Much Hadham. Herts. Studied at Leeds 
School of Art after World War 
1 on ex-servicemans grant; then 
at Royal College of Art, London, 
where in 1925 he won scholarship 
for study on the Continent. Offic
ial War artist 1940-42; for many 
years a trustee of the Tate Gall
ery, London. Member of the

cipient of many honorary degrees 
and awards at home and abroad.

Male Sex Getting 
Stronger, Health 
Foundation Report
From a healtn standpoint, the 
largest, most influential minority 
group in this country today is 
the male sex.
Its not that men are getting 
weaker. Its just that the weaker 
sex is growing stronger all the 
time.
This is one of the facts brought 
out by Health Information Foun
dation in its continuing studies of 
Americas health progress. We 
Americans are living longer now 
than ever before, and lifespans 
are expected to lengthen even 
more in the future. Moreover, 
geographic differences in mortal
ity are narrowing. Todays citydweller, for example, is almost as 
long-lived as the person who 
spends all his life in the country.
Dead Men
A disquieting note in the pic
ture is the widening gap between 
male and female death rates. 
Women now outnumber men at 
every age past the mid-twenties, 
and female life expectancy at 
birth is more than six years long
er.
Women, in fact, have been 
among the most fortunate bene
ficiaries of twentieth century med
ical progress. In 1900, the Foun
dation reports, about 20,000 moth
ers died in childbirth as compared 
with fewer than 1,600 in 1956.
Early in the century, contagious 
diseases such as pneumonia, influ
enza, and tuberculosis were the 
leading causes of death, and they 
killed only a slightly higher pro
portion of males than females. 
Now that medical science has 
sharply reduced the dangers from 
such illnesses, degenerative ail
ments have become the chief 
threat to life. And these diseases 
take a relatively greater toll of 
men.
Heart disease, which caused 40 
per cent of all deaths in 1956, 
killed 80 per cent more men than 
women. Cancer, which accounted 
for 16 per cent of all deaths in 
1956, had an excess male mor
tality of 20 per cent.
Strong Women
Some doctors think that women 
are constitutionally tougher than 
men. But regardless of biological 
factors, women seem to be less 
subject to the tensions that ag
gravate so many illnesses. Even 
with more and more women workAs low as $774 from New York ... 40 days
ing, the pressure to compete and 
succeed still falls mainly on the 
male.*
Women also seem to take better 
care of themselves. Despite their 
lower mortality rates, women re
port more illness and go to their 
doctors more often than men do, 
according to statistics by the 
Foundation. This may mean that 
women have more time to get 
adequate medical careor simply 
that they make more time.
The masculine tendency to shrug 
off symptoms may be a factor in 
the higher male death toll. A 
more easily measured factor, 
though, is the fatal accident. 
Many more men than women are 
killed accidentallynot only be
cause more males climb moun
tains, drive golf balls and mis
handle firearms, but also because 
many more men are involved in 
auto accidents. In the 20-24 age 
group, the male accident fatality 
rate is five times as high as the 
female.
Cities Healthier
In contrast to the widening gap 
between male and female life ex
pectancy, differences between ur
ban and rural health levels are 
narrowing. Cities used to be 
breeding places for epidemics. To
day theyre healthier places to 
live, even though theyre more 
congested than ever.
Mass immunization programs 
and the extension of pure food and
 ardrug laws have helped greatly, in 
addition, municipal health authori
ties are learning how to curb new 
threats to public safety, such as 
air pollution.
One statistic cited by H.I.F. 
dramatizes the trend. In 1901, life 
expectancy in New York City was 
about seven years less for males 
and about six years less for fe
males than the comparable aver
ages for the country as a wh$>, 
Today there is no significant enfference.Progress
Progress has been made in rural 
areas, too, of coursepartly be
cause people in the country now 
have better access to hospitals and 
medical specialists in the metro
politan areas. In fact, more than 
half the rural population today 
is nonfarmno longer a villagecrossroads population but one lk-t 
ing in large part on highways ami 
other main arteries between cities.
Citycountry differences in 
health are less important these 
days than are regional distinctions, 
according to Health Information 
Foundation. The West North Cen
tral farm statesNorth Dakota, 
Minnesota, South Dakota, Nebras
ka, Iowa, Kansas, and Missiouri 
had the lowest death rate of any 
region in 1957, 7.5 deaths per l,<j 
population. The heavily urbaniz? 
Middle Atlantic statesNew York, 
Pennsylvania, and New Jersey 
had the highest mortality of any 
region, 8.7 per 1,000.

Mew Tartan Section 
Covers ROTC Activities
The ROTC department, in cooperation with the Tartan 
staff brings you the ROTC Guidon. This section will be
come a regular feature of the Tartan.
Since the ROTC is the largest organized group on cams, it was decided that more representation was needed 
!r such a group. This is the main'
sure and just flew out of it. How
ever, even with 213 HP on a light 
airframe this is not a recommend
ed practice! All things considered, 
it is a very forgiving airplane. 
Flight School 
About the schoola new class 
is started every three weeks and 
there are six classes in the various 
stages of training at one time. 
Each class starts about 60 strong 
and loses about 25 per cent. Most 
loses are from self-elimination. I 
should stress at this point that 
precision flying is taught here 
and that a man really has to want 
to get through in order to make 
the grade.
The flight instructors are the 
best that you could find any
where. Some entire classes have 
gone through here accident free 
and it server to point up the fact 
that you learn to fly safely at 
Gary and you learn to fly tactical
ly at Camp Rucker.
Landing's 
Dont worry about your landings 
old manonly a short time ago I 
considered a good landing (con
trolled crash) anything that I 
.could walk away from. Now, after 
some 150 dual and solo landings 
I can still bounce them in. Just 
dont make the mistake one of 
the new men did, he had a per
fect good landing and then reached 
down to retract flaps shortly after 
touching down.. .when he took his 
eyes off the strip his bird set up 
a ground loop and it cost some 
embarrassment, one main landing 
gear, one wing tip and one prop... 
so it goes.
One thing that will please you 
is the finances...a 2nd Lt. re

$120 for advanced training, $6 per

notice to observers that a man is 
part of an organization, one of 
many members of a team. The 
uniform represents that organiza
tion or team and its line of work.
Group
Since the uniform represents 
a group, the man wearing the 
uniform is expected to display 
the best traits of that group as 
a matter of common practice. The 
uniform should call forth the best 
in a man; honesty, self confi
dence, integrity. Thus, a man in 
uniform is expected to be pro
ficient and uprighteous in his en
deavors. This is taken for grant
ed.
Lets apply some of the pre
vious statements to this campus 
and consider the uniform of the 
ROTC cadet.
It would be foolish to hedge 
from the fact that many critic
isms (both comical and vengeful) 
are made of and to the cadets. 
Notice the use of one word 
cadet. The word cadet is con
strued to mean a beginner or 
novice in the military profession.
A Problem
This, therefore, leaves us with 
a problem. How can a uniformed 
man properly display Army dis
cipline and training if he is a 
novice? This problem has a very 
simple answerhe cant. As ca
dets, mistakes will be made. They 
are expected and knowledge is 
gained through them. But, these 
mistakes are made by a man in 
uniform and mistakes are not 
supposed to be made by men in 
uniform. This is probably the 
only reason why the ROTC cadets 
are the butt of so much critic
ism.
Lets remember the next time 
someone makes a mistake that 
mistakes are natural, knowledge 
is gained through them, and that 
at another time you might make 
a much bigger mistake.
CIT ROTC Has 
Own Humor In 
Uniform Column
One of the cadet platoon leaders 
has come up with a new command 
whose practical applications are 
so numerous that a revision of 
FM 22-5 may be required. While 
marching the platoon down to the 
basement of Maggie Murph last
fall, the cadet (Who shall remain 
nameless) ordered Port Arms, 
Column Left, Down the Stairs, 
Double Time, March. Well, what 
would you have said, then?
* * *
Woodlawn Pharmacy has noti
fied us that they wish to be in
formed several weeks in advance 
before the next seasons drill com
mences. They reported that a de
luge of orders for the infamous 5- 
Day Deodorant Pads (which pro
duce a miraculously glossy shine 
on shoes) completely depleted 
their stock before the first fall 
drill.
They claim that they cant 
afford to lose all these potential 
customers since sales of the 5-Day 
Deodorant Pads make up for loss 
on food-stained magazines. P.S. 
Dave Love, the regimental com
mander, promises demerits to any
one whose shoes turn white from 
contact of water upon the glossy 
finish.* * *
Mystery Solved! After the last 
drill session of the fall, the Alpha 
Company guidon disappeared. This 
was strange, for who on earth 
would want to steal a ROTC 
guidon? The mystery was solved 
when the A Company guidon was 
seen flying in all its glory from D 
tower of Morewood Gardens. Well, 
girls?* * *
Vic Polansky, D Company com
mander, thought he was hearing 
things when he called roll one day. 
When he called, Johnson, he re
ceived three simultaneous replies 
of Here! Much to his chagrin, 
Vie found a set of twins plus an
other cadet named Johnson. Vic 
says hes glad he doesnt have to 
call roll every week.

Superstitions 
Explainable
Ever wish on a falling star? 
Or bulldoze bad luck with a 
knock on wood? Ever change 
course when a black cat crosses 
your path?
If you do, youre not the only 
one. Though no one admits to it, 
practically everyone has at least 
one pet superstition.
The idea of a lucky star dates 
from the Nativity  the Star of 
Bethlehem. And why are black 
cats ominous? Because our medi
eval ancestors were positive the 
Devil and his witches-in-waiting 
prowled the earth in the garb of 
black cats.
Knocking on wood comes from 
the Druids on ancient England 
who believed trees were inhabited 
by gods. When asking a favor, 
Druid priests would touch the 
bark of a tree. If the tree-god 
was in a good mood (a mood to 
grant the favor!) hed return the 
Druids knock.
Unlucky Ladders
If some wooden things are 
lucky, why are wooden ladders 
so fearful? This superstition 
stems from early mystics who 
saw the triangle as a symbol of 
teh Trinity, and hence, of etern
ity. Anyone who barges through 
the triangle under a ladder is 
therefore tempting the fates  
who may retaliate by pushing the 
paint bucket over! But the blund
erer can save himself in one of 
three magic ways: 1) By making 
a wish. 2) By crossing his fingers. 
3) By making the sign of the fig 
(closing the fist and thrusting the 
middle finger).
The higher significance of the 
fig has been lost in the mists of
history, but two crossed fingers 
have long symbolized perfect 
unity, any wishmade at the junc
tion of a crosswhere two roads, 
two lines, or even two fingers 
metthis was_ a wish that was 
caught and would never slip 
away!
The Bible is full of Friday 
calamities  the fall of Adam 
and Eve, the flood, the confusion 
at Babel, the death of Christ. And 
when you add to fateful Friday 
the fearful number 13 (there were 
13 at the Last Supper of Jesus), 
the result is a combination that 
awes many a superstitious citizen. 
No less a personage than Winston 
Churchill refuses to travel on 
Friday the 13th.ISoulless Women!
Backward regions have their 
own pet superstitions. If you be
long to certain central African 
tribes, and if youre a woman, 
you would never be allowed to 
eat liver. Why? Tribal lore says 
the liver is the seat of the soul, 
says also that women obviously 
have no souls (and mustnt be al
lowed to get any!).
But you dont have to go to 
backward regions to find people 
carrying rabbits feet. This comes 
from our cave man ancestors who 
were awed by the way a rabbit 
thumped his hind foot, as if sig| nailing other cottontails, while 
romping around in the moon
light. (The moon goddess was 
universally worshipped and fear
ed.)
Another animal, the horse, was 
also sacred to many pagan peo
ple. And since everybody knew 
iron could route demons, it was 
natural that the horseshoe would 
bring good luck!
Almost all of us have the habit 
of covering our mouth when we 
yawn. Surely not a superstition, 
we say, but just good manners.
rAnd yet it all began when our 
forebears were afraid that yawn
ing would' let an evil spirit enter 
their bodies. They were afraid, 
very literally, of losing their 
breath.
New Superstitions
Far from being the musty old 
relic that many people think it 
is, superstition is as lively, con
temporary and quick-sprouting as 
a garden weed. New ones are 
sprouting up all the time. In the 
last 20 years, baby shoes have 
become the guarantee of automo
tive safety for many a driver. 
And from the lunch counters and 
hamburger joints throughout the 
country a baffling belief has 
arisen  bubbles clustered in the 
center of your coffee mean money 
on the way.
An estimated 20 million of us 
tote lucky charms of one sort or 
another. President Eisenhower 
carries a five-guinea gold piece. 
Harry Truman cant be separated 
from a miniature piano. Count
less numbers of us wear lucky 
clothes at crucial times.
So instead of burying that rab
bits foot in your pocket, take it 
out and show it to your friends. 
They might turn out to be fellow 
fetishists! But be careful. A gust 
of ill-wind might blow your lucky 
charm under a ladder or across 
a black cats path. All the fourleaf clovers in Ireland couldnt 
help you then!

City Announces Plan 
For New Auditorium
Twelve thousand people are watching a boxing match in 
the new civic auditorium. It begins to drizzle. A woman 
frowns. A man presses a button. Quietly, a stainless steel 
dome slides into position. No rain. The match continues, 
everybodys happy. ?-----------------------------------------------------
That, in a nutshell, is how 
things are going to be when the 
$20 million Pittsburgh civic audi
torium, now under construction is 
completed.
A key structure in the citys 
ambitious civic redevelopment 
program, the Auditorium, includ
ing the mall and parking area, 
will include some 20 acres in the 
heart of town. During the year, 
it will play host to concerts, ex
hibits, business meetings, the 
Civic Light opera, musical shows, 
rodeos, tennis matches, water 
shows, political and civic meet
ings. An adaptable seating ar
rangement will accommodate from 
7,500 to 14,000 people, depending 
on the event.
Redevelopment 
The Auditorium is just part of
the Lower Hill Redevelopment 
aimed at transforming 94.5 acres 
of blighted area at the upper end 
of the citys Golden Triangle into 
a modern and cultural showplace.
The spectacular dome is the 
first of its kind in the world. It 
is to be composed of eight sec
tions, all sheathed with stainless 
steel. Six of the sections will be 
moveable and two stationary. 
When the roof is retracted, the six 
sections (three on each side) will 
roll over the two fixed sections to 
open the huge arena to the skies.
For one thing, its just about 
the most weatherproof metal 
there is. Stainless steel finds uses 
in the most corrosive atmospheres 
salt air as well as industrial. It 
is corrosion resistant all the way 
through, not just on the surface.
Biggest Umbrella
Architect's model of Pittsburghs new civic auditorium shows the 
spectacular retractable dome open.
Stainless steel is widely used 
for modern entrances, interior 
wall panels, lobby decorations 
the gamut of architectural appli
cations that call for structural 
strength, freedom from corrosion 
plus handsome appearance. And 
the rugged material is virtually 
self-cleaningnormal rainfall is 
all that will be needed to keep 
the dome attractively clean.
WRITE
The annual WRITE contest, 
sponsored by Pi Delta Epsilon, 
presents to students unlimited op
portunities for expression on any 
topic, from parodies to photo
graphic essays.
Humorous or fictional articles 
would be written for the Scot, 
for example, photographic essays 
for the Thistle, editorial or 
news stories for the Tartan, 
radio scripts for WRCT, and tech
nical articles for the Technical. 
A Contest 
WRITE, remember, is a contest, 
and entries will be judged by men 
or women in the Pittsburgh area. 
There will be five prizes  one 
for each publication  of $25.00 
each, plus publication or broad
cast of the winning entries.
The rules for WRITE have been 
divided into two groups, general 
and specific.
General Rules
1.Any member of the student 
body of Carnegie Tech Institute 
of Technology is eligible, in
cluding night school students 
and members of the In-Step 
Program.
2. Contestants may enter any one 
, or all of the five parts of the
contest.
3. Unless otherwise indicated in 
the specific rules, all entries 
must be submitted on 8Y2 x 
11 white, unlined paper, type
written and double-spaced.
4. All entries must be submitted 
by April 1, 1959, and addressed 
or delivered to Pi Delta Epsilon, 
Melissa Ivkovich, 7B, Morewood Gardens, with the name 
of the publication for which it 
is intended indicated clearly.
5. Entries will be judged on the 
basis of originality, interest of
topic, and method of presenta
tion. Decision of the judges will 
be final.
6. All entries become the property 
of PiDE and cannot be return
ed. PiDE reserves the right to 
edit winning entries before 
their publication.
Specific Rules, Scot
1. Articles of humorous, satirical, 
or serious nature may be sub
mitted.
2. Limitation: not over 2,000
words.
Tartan
1. Entries may be in the form of 
editorial items, commentaries, 
feature articles, or interview, 
and do not necessarily have to 
deal with subjects pertaining 
to Carnegie Tech.
2. Limitation: no longer than 1,000 
words.
Thistle
1. Entries are to be in the form of 
a photo-essay.
2. The subject of the essay is re
stricted to one dealing with 
Carnegie Tech.
3. The essay is to be laid out in 
completed form as a double 
page spread on two 18 x 24 
boards. (The longest dimension 
of the board is to be vertical, 
the form then is that of a 
photo-essay found in any of the 
picture magazines, such as 
Life.)
4. Title, captions, and text may 
be used in any form. However, 
it is to be remembered that a 
photo-essay is just that  a 
story in pictures.
5. Photos are to be mounted on 
the board with rubber cement. 
Title, captions, and text are to 
be done on paper and mounted 
on the board in an^ manner,
6. No more than three entries will 
be allowed per entrant.
7. Judging will be on the basis of 
effectiveness of presentation as 
a photo essay and on technical 
quality.
Technical
A detailed account of rules for
Technical articles will be found
on page 47 of the October 1957
issue under the heading, ManiJscript Guide. Limitation of space 
prevents publishing these rules. 
However, the type of article 
would definitely have to be tech
nical, and the length limitation is 
4,000 words.
WRCT
1. Entries shall consist of finished 
scripts of one-half hour play
ing time. Subject matter is un>, 
limited, though radio plays aft* 
particulaily invited.
2. Limitation: Since the winning 
script is to be taped for presen
tation over WRCT, considera
tion should be given to limited 
facilities for sound effects avail
able to the station.
Students may obtain copies of 
the rules in the Dean of Students 
office. Youve got nothing to lcj} 
and everything to gain. Dorvr 
hesitate to try! Enter the WRITE 
contest.

mean that approximately one half 
of the bleachers will be below the 
Cut and one half, above.
Demolition
Four buildings have been torn 
down already, and the old mar
ried students barracks will be de
molished in June. The remaining 
old houses along Forbes and Mar
garet Morrison Streets will be 
torn down as the program pro
gresses.
There will be about 60,000 cubic 
yards of earth left from the 1$1 
after the bowl has been fill, 
which will be used to fill the Ed
wards property behind Morewood 
and thus make much more of the 
property useful. The total cost of 
the grading operation is estimated 
at $160,000.
According to administration 
sources, the new Activities Cen
ter should be completed by June 
of next year. The Tartan will 
give a detailed report of the 
plans and facilities of the new 
center as soon, as they are avail
able.

?
If you're the kind of person who thinks for 
yourself . . . you use judgment in your 
choice of cigarettes, as in everything else. 
Men and women who think for themselves 
usually smoke VICEROY. Their reason? 
Best in the world. They know that only 
VICEROY has a thinking man's filter and 
a smoking man's taste.
*If you checked (A) on three out of the first 
four questions, and (B) on four out of the last 
five... you really think for yourself!
