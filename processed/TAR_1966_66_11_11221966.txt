Seven-College Group 
To Spark Discussion
The seven degree-granting institutions in the Pitts
burgh area have banded together to form the Collegiate As
sociation of Pittsburgh. CAP consists of Chatham College, 
Carnegie Institute of Technology, Duquesne University, 
Mount Mercy College, University of Pittsburgh, Point Park 
College, and Robert Morris College.
The new organization will, ac
cording to Article II oi its con
stitution, serve four functions. It 
will promote inter-school contact; 
act as a discussion group dealing 
with proolems of a social, cultur
al, and educational nature; serve 
as a central source of informa
tion about member schools and 
their students; and finally, it shall 
limit the scope of its discussion 
to non-political subjects.
The schools in CAP will be 
represented through their stu
dent governments. Represent
ing Tech in CAP will be Joe 
Orens, president of the Student 
Senate.
The association has already be
gun to deal with some subjects 
of interest to Pittsburgh college 
students. In a meeting held on 
Nov. 12, the group discussed the 
reorganization of student groups 
and the handling of budgets for 
the organizations. Also the sub
ject of a Smart Student Shoppers 
Board was brought up. This plan 
would call for the arranging of 
discounts for students from vari
ous merchants. Already some lo
cal stores have agreed to give 
six to ten per cent discounts to 
members of student bodies of 
CAP schools. A full program of 
this sort is expected by the be
ginning of January.
Another idea which CAP 
hopes to institute is the sale 
of tickets to one schools events 
at the other schools. It is also 
hoped that a mixer of member 
schools leaders may be organ
ized so as to allow the leaders 
to get together and discuss 
their mutual interests.
Although the approved consti
tution does call for officers, they 
will not be elected until CAP 
becomes larger and better estab
lished.

Increased Tuition To Meet 
Rising Cost of Education
by E. W. Seley
Carnegie Tech's additional revenue from the recentlyannounced $250 tuition increase will not go toward the con
struction of new buildings, maintenance of the present phy
sical plant, or research, according to President H. Guyford 
Stever. -------------------------------------------
Increased Aid To Counter 
Tuition Rise, Says Nachtwey
Now that tuition has increased by $250 for the third time in the past five years, 
what happens to students attending school on scholarships and loans ? What about those 
who are now paying their own way but wont be able to meet the rise in fees ?
The Carnegie Tech policy is
Stever stressed rather that the 
tuition hike was for the purpose 
of meeting the rising cost of edu
cation. The funds pay for faculty 
salaries, and departmental and 
library operations.
The tuition rise was predicted 
several months ago by the ad
ministration to meet the com
petition that exists among other 
educational institutions, indus
try, and Carnegie Tech to em
ploy a faculty that would allow 
Carnegie Tech to remain at 
the top of the totem pole rath
er than becoming low man.
At a student luncheon in Skibo 
two weeks, ago, Dr. Stever cited 
the rising salary for Fine Arts 
faculty and warned, Tuition will 
go upit has to.
Increasing Salaries
TTie increase in faculty salaries 
has risen over the past several 
years at about five to seven per 
cent yearly. Thus, if Carnegie 
Tech is to keep pace with the ris
ing costs of education, it too must 
demand the necessary funds to 
meet these increases.
According to Stever, we 
could let Tech go down hill, but 
we have to think of the future 
and remaining a first-rate uni
versity.
Informal Parties 
Close Rush
First semester Fraternity Rush 
closes out Friday, Dec. 2, with 
informal parties at the 12 Tech 
houses. The parties are open to 
all rushees, with or without 
dates, and last from 8:30 pm to 1 
am.
Formal rush starts Thursday, 
Feb. 2, 1967, and ends on pledg
ing night, Monday, Feb. 13. The 
tentative formal rush schedule is:
Thursday, Feb. 2Dinner;
Friday, Feb. 10Smoker;
Monday, Feb. 6Dinner;
Tuesday, Feb. 7Commuter 
Lunch;
Wednesday, Feb. 8Dinner;
Friday, Feb. 10Smoker;
Saturday, Feb. 11 Party;
Monday, Feb. 13Pledging.
Tuition covers approximately 50 
per cent of educational costs. The 
other half of the funds necessary 
to maintain the university come 
from donations of individuals and 
grants from industry, foundations 
and the governments. The com
plication of getting money has in
creased, says Stever. More money 
now goes into getting the money 
necessary to maintain Carnegie 
Tech.
Research Self-Supporing
Research generally pays for 
itself, explained Stever. Expen
ses, salaries and overhead, and 
the education of graduate to stu
dents are all included in research 
programs. Money given for re
search covers all the areas of the 
research program.
Stever added several comments 
on complaints from liberal arts 
and fine arts students that the 
majority of funds donated to Car
negie Tech go to the engineering 
and science fields. He stated, No
bodys tuition pays for all his 
education. Stever explained that 
money coming from individual 
and industrial endowments goes 
toward other areas beside the en
gineering programs. The Hunt 
Library, for example, was donat
ed by a man formerly in indus
try. and contained within the li
brary are areas purposely devoted 
to the fine arts.
Endowment Valuable
Endowment income covers one 
tenth of all expenses of the uni
versity other than food and lodg
ing. Carnegie Tech is not able to 
depend upon endowment alone to 
support its operations despite the 
fact that endowments are of in
calculable value to the univer
sity.
Carnegie Tech competes for its 
faculty members on the salary 
level, says Stever. Its fringe bene
fits are good but are not as firm
ly emphasized as salaries.
The affiliation with Mellon 
Institute, added President Stev 
er, does not imply or mean 
that Tech money is being used 
at Mellon Institute nor that Mel
lon money is going into Car
negie Tech. The increase in 
tuition has nothing to do with 
the amalgamation with Mellon 
Institute. The additional $250 is 
for faculty salaries, departmen
tal operations and library op
eration only.
Grill Opens 
Monday, Still 
Not Completed
The Tartan Grill in Skibo 
will open Monday, Nov. 28. 
It will still be only half done, 
thoughthe mezzaine is not 
finished and will be tempor
arily roped off.
Tentative operating hours for 
the Grill will be 10 am to 12 mid
night on weekdays, and until 1 
am on weekends.
Booths on Order
Booths for the mezzanine are 
due to arrive around Christmas, 
according to R. D. Strathmeyer, 
vice-president for Business Af
fairs. Previous reports that the 
furniture would be in by Thanks
giving were erroneous.
The Student Union Commit
tee of Student Government is 
still working on plans for the 
recreation area below the mez
zanine. In the old Snack Bar, 
this area was occupied by two 
ping-pong tables and several 
small eating tables.
Food Service Committee is go
ing over the final draft of a 
menu for the Grill.
The opening of the Grill had 
already been postponed once be
cause of the mezzanine not being 
finished. But last week, Student 
Senate, prompted largely by pres
sure from commuters voted un
animously to open the Grill im
mediately after Thangsgiving.
Rudolph Serkin 
Plays In Oakland
The Musical Society of the YM 
and WHA will present its third 
concert of a series of nine on 
Wednesday, Nov. 30, at 8:40 in 
the evening, in the Morris Kaufmann Memorial Auditorium. The 
guest artist appearing is Rudolf 
Serkin, internationally known pi
anist. He has often appeared as 
soloist on this concert stage since 
his first appearance in Pittsburgh 
in 1936. Mr. Serkin will perform 
three major works, the Schuberts 
Sonata in A Major, opus 120; 
Schuberts Four Impromptus, 
opus 142, and the Sonata in B 
Flat Major (Hammerklavier) 
opus 106 by Beethoven. Anyone 
interested should make prompt 
inquiries about reservations by 
calling the Musical Society Box 
Office621-650Q.
that no student will be denied 
an education because of finan
cial need, according to Peter 
H. Nachtwey, Director of Fin
ancial Aid. Aid will continue 
to be based on need and will 
continue to be based on the 
College Scholarship Service . . . 
and we will continue to meet 
need.
A students need is determin
ed from the Parents Confidential 
Statement, published by the Col
lege Scholarship Service, which 
calculates the amount of money 
a student and his family are able 
to contribute toward his educa
tion. This amount, subtracted iron 
the students total fees at Car
negie, gives his need.
Three Aid Sources
Aid granted to Carnegie Tech 
students comes from three 
sources: 1) Budgeted financial 
aid from school funds. This is 
normally increased each year and 
should increase more than usual 
next year because of the tuition 
rise, says Nachtwey. Figures from 
the Office of the Accountant bear 
this prediction out.
Tuition jumped from $1200 to 
$1450 in 1963, and then to $1700 
in 1965. The yearly increase in 
budgeted aid since 1963 is tab
ulated below. Years in which tui
tion rose are starred:
1963 ..............................$33,500*
1964 ................................ 11,000
1965 ................................ 99,000*
1966 ............................. 26,800
Some of the funds from the tui
tion hike will come back to the 
students in the form of financial 
aid. Usually, these budgeted funds 
are overexpended the 1965-66 act
ual spending fell $6,000 short of 
the budgeted amount.
2) Endowment is pooled and in
vested through Mellon Bank. The 
investments are varied to drive 
as high an income as possible. It 
is this income which students re
ceive as aid.
According to the Controller, 
adjustment to increased tuition 
are either in the form of larger 
portions of this aid to less peo
ple or more portions of a smal
ler size. The sum of income 
tends to increase at a relatively 
fixed rate.
3) Outright gifts from indepen
dent donors. According to Con
troller John R. Hauser, com
munications are going out to don
ors telling about the increased 
tuition and suggesting further 
donations.
Government scholarships are al
most nonexistent, but Hauser says, 
I believe that Techs request for 
funds in the governments workstudy program will be increased. 
We will do everything we possibly 
can to increased available stu
dent aid.*

Edward Teller Advocates 
Survival By Firm Defense
by Mike Vargo
If we are to survive in a nuclear world one where 13 nations will soon have atomic 
bombs and the hardware to launch themwe must build a rocket defense system against 
ballistic missiles and drastically increase our spending on civil defense. Further, we must 
protect our allies by giving them ballistic missile defense systems and adopt a policy 
of openness about our nuclear planning to relieve the tension of the dizzying arms race 
and eventually stop it.
Dr. Edward Teller, world-renowned physicist and key man in the development 
of this countrys atomic arsenal, made these proposals in an after-dinner speech before 
the American Assembly in Skibo Friday night. Dr. Teller didnt come to talk
about one-upsmanship in the weap-Escape!
Get out from under this weekend. Fly some
placefor half fare on Eastern.
Visit a friend in another town. See an 
'away" game. Change the scene. Leave late, 
come back late, enjoy a long weekend  
without cutting classes.
Use your Eastern Youth ID Card, or an
other airline's version. If you don't have one 
and you're under 22you really ought to.
To get your Youth Fare Card, send a $3 
check or money order, proof of age (copy
of driver's license, birth certificate or pass
port) to Eastern Airlines, Department 350, 
10 Rockefeller Plaza, N. Y., N. Y. 10020 
With your Youth ID Card, you can get 
an Eastern ticket for half fare. No advance 
reservations are permitted. But if there's a 
seat free at departure time, after passen
gers holding reservations and military per
sonnel have been seated, you can fly to 
any Eastern city in the United States. And 
look down on all the drivers.
ASTERNNUMBER ONE TO THE FUN
ons race or keeping up with the 
Joneskis in the ICBM department; 
he came to talk about survival.
Teller speaks slowly and dra
matically with a heavy Hungarian 
accent. His voice was urgent, al. 
most desparate, as he pleaded 
for immediate adoption of his pro
posals. He sounded like just anoth
er alarmist, a frantic politician, 
unless one remembered that this 
man is an expert in his field and 
knows what hes talking about.
Probable and Dangerous 
Nuclear proliferation, the de
velopment of atomic war-making 
capacity by new nations, is a 
probable and dangerous develop 
ment, says Tellerprobable be
cause nuclear weapons are sur
prisingly cheap and easy to 
make, and dangerous because 
Nuclear attack may be exceed
ingly sudden ... in a critical sit
uation there will not be time for 
arriving at reasonable conclus
ions.
Test-ban treaties do not put 
Dr. Teller at ease. The partial 
test ban did not prevent the 
most dangerous development  
that of the Chinese nuclear ca
pability, he says. "If treaties 
could prevent wars, then the 
second World War would never 
have happened.
Teller doesnt place blissful 
trust in retaliatory strikes as a 
deterrent to war, either. A deter
rent reduces the probability of a 
strike against us, but the stakes 
are too high to play probability 
games. He looks beyond the 
launching of bombs, to survival 
and getting back on our feet 
Survival Possible 
He thinks a ballistic missile de
fense system (obviously referring 
to the controversial Nike-X sys
tem), along with an expanded 
civil defense program, can make 
it almost certain that ... we will 
survive. He doesnt know if such 
a combined defense would nullify 
a Russian attack, but it would stop 
an attack by a newcomer to 
the nuclear club. Against the 
newcomers, defense is needed and 
is possible . . . against the Rus 
sians defense may or may not be 
possible and should be discussed 
later.
Civil defense, according to 
Teller, is the weakest link in 
our defense: for it we spend 
not much more than one tenth 
of one cent of our defense dol
lar . . . ten cents should be 
spent ... as long as we have 
no civil defense,' the United

Scotch *N Soda Prepares 
For All-Campus Musical
The Scotch n Soda Club announces auditions for its 1967 
original musical production Pippin, Pippin, by Ron Strauss, 
a sophomore drama major.
On Tuesday, Nov. 29, at 8 p.m. 
there will be a brief and infor
mal meeting in the Wherrett room 
for students interested in audi
tioning. The meeting is not com
pulsory, but slides of previous 
productions will be shown, music 
from this years presentation 
played and information on this 
years auditions given.
The audition policy has been 
revised. Those people who were 
in the cast of either Whatserface or Nouveau must try out 
on either of the first two weeks 
of auditions (Dec. 2, 3 or Dec.
9, 10). The last weekend of au
ditions is reserved for those 
people who were in neither of 
these productions. They may, 
however, audition during any 
of the weekends mentioned.
The cast contains nine major 
roles, five female and four male. 
These people should be able to 
sing, dance, and act. A large 
chorus of singers and dancers is 
also needed to fill many featured 
roles.
Those wishing to audition 
should bring or know both a slow 
and a fast number. A pianist will 
be provided. Persons interested 
in crew work  sets, costumes, 
props, make-up-, lighting .sound, 
and businessshould sign up at 
the Skibo desk during the audi
tion times.
Open to All
All Tech undergraduates from 
ail departments except drama 
may audition. Drama students, 
however, are permitted to be in 
the crew.
Pippin is being staged by Law
rence Stephens. Settings are by 
Stanley Thomas with costume de
signs by Richard Keshishian. The 
show concerns the political in
trigues of Charlemagnes court as 
his two sons try to gain control 
of the throne. It will run from 
April 28 to May 4, 1967.

States could be completely 
wrecked a nuclear attack.
Other free countries must have 
American-built ballistic missile 
defense systems, too, Teller 
thinks. He cited the India-Pakistan 
conflict as an example of how 
mutual fear is a driving force 
behind small but dangerous brushfire wars. By providing missile 
defense systems for our allies, 
we can thus deprive our friends 
of their greatest incentive to de
velop nuclear weapons . . . The 
will to survive can be used for 
the right purpose.
These rocket defense systems 
can be so designed that it would 
be impossible for an ambitious 
neighbor to convert them to of
fensive weapons. They can be 
built so that if someone tries to 
change the program of the sys
tem, that weapon will go up in 
blue smoke.
Advocates Frankness 
Tellers pleas for our allies lead 
up to his chief demandthat the
United States initiate a policy of 
openness about its nuclear ca
pacities and its plans for using 
them. The right weapon of a 
dictatorship is secrecy, he says; 
the right weapon of a democracy 
is openness.
Day-to-day tactical questions 
have to be secret, he says, and 
some political discussions may 
have to be kept quiet while in 
process, but we cannot keep secret 
the atomic bomb or the multiplica
tion table.
We cannot fool ourselves in
to thinking complicated engi
neering designs can be kept 
for long ... I almost know that 
the Russians know all our se
crets.
Groups around the country 
have to discuss nuclear prolifera
tion and defense without the 
facts, Teller complains, and 
without the facts of life, they 
will make the wrong decisions. 
He doesnt believe the Russians 
would adopt this openness poli
cy  they have already rejected 
Eisenhowers open skies pro
posalbut we should carry out
the open skies policy ourselves 
. . . rational people under stress 
entertain dangerous suspicions ... 
openness is the condition for dis
armament.
So this is Tellers stand: not 
an idealistic peace-movement 
idea nor a fanatical best de
fense is a good offense policy, 
but an aggressive defense poli
cy.
No matter what we do, he 
says, we will live in an atomic 
world. The atomic world will not 
be comfortable no matter what 
we do, but the atomic world need 
not end in disaster.

Random Guessing
Once again the completion of the Tartan Grill, despite 
the random guessing of Student Government, and the Divi
sion of Planning and Construction, has been postponed until 
after Christmas. However, in the latest guess, the grill will 
open this coming week, only half-completed, with the mez
zanine yet to be finished.
Originally the grill was optimistically scheduled to 
be opened October 15. However, Homecoming weekend 
passed, with the construction far from completion. Af
ter delays in obtaining materials, the basic construction 
was finally completed a few weeks ago. Yet the paneling 
on the mezzaine walls has not been completely installed. 
Conceivably, this could further postpone the partial 
opening next week.
In an article in the September 15 issue of the Tartan, 
not only was the Director of Planning and Construction 
quoted as saying the grill would be open October 15, but it 
was intimated that all the necessary purchasing and order
ing of furnishing and other materials had been done. All 
that remained was the actual renovation work, then the 
tables, chairs, and booths could be installed in short order, 
and the whole operation would be back in business as soon 
as possible. There were no official statements to the con
trary.
Since that time, it has become apparent that little of 
this necessary purchasing had been done. The rugs for the 
mezzanine have not yet arrived. Further, the plans for fur
nishing the mezzanine have changed a number of times, 
contributing to the delays.
Many of these problems were foreseen as early as the 
first part of October, yet no one, either in Student Govern
ment or on the administrative side took the initiative or re
sponsibility to inform the campus, publically, that there 
would be delays. In addition, many materials were not or
dered until late October, hence the grill could not have pos
sibly been done by the proposed date.
It would appear that in a case such as this, where 
many students are dependent on the grill for meals 
while on campus, the renovation would have been ex
pedited as quickly as possible. More importantly, since 
many delays have upset the original, highly optimistic 
plans, the campus should have been informed regarding 
when the construction would be completed. Rather than 
erroneous guesses, from misinformed sources, a reason
able estimate, including foreseeable delays, should have 
been issued.

Shakespeare 
Next Feature 
At PlayHouse
Shakespeare*s A Midsum
mer Nights Dream will be 
presented as a black come
dy under the artistic direc
tion of John Hancock at the 
Pittsburgh Playhouse. This 
third play of the season will 
open in the Craft Avenue 
Theatre Friday, Nov. 25.
Director Hancock interprets 
Shakespeares famous comedy 
as a brutal erotic nightmare 
about lust and a desire to kill. 
In the Playhouses production, 
he hopes to bring out the 
dark elements hidden beneath 
the fairy-tale frosting of most 
productions!
Heading the cast of the comedy 
will be Barton Heyman in the featurned role of Puck, the mischiev
ous elf who delights in the pranks 
he plays on other characters in 
the play. Caught in a four-way 
love entanglement are Gretchen 
Oehler as the love-struck Hermia 
who refuses to marry the man 
her father has chosen for her; 
Robert Benson, a six-foot fourinch man as the love-lorn Hel
ena; Ronald Colby, who as Lysander has been forbidden to 
marry Hermia; and Baker Salsbury as Demetrius, who, loved 
by Helena, is in love with Her
mia.
Mr. Hancock hopes to catch 
the illogic of dreams with such 
innovations as a gaudily-lighted 
juke-box at one side of the stage, 
playing Mendelssohns music and 
Mahlers Song of the Earth. 
Oberson is played by an actor 
thoroughly shrouded seemingly 
headless. Demetrius is equipped 
with a cod-piece that lights up on 
certain cues. The fairies are pup
pets, shaped as cubic grotesques 
and the soldiers appear in face
less masks. The love-lorn Helena 
is played by an actor six-feet 
four - inches tall dressed as a 
woman. Some moments are play
ed in a slow dream-like motion, 
and a zombie scene has been add
ed.
Tickets are on sale at Gimbels, 
Hornes, Penn - Sheraton Hotel, 
Pitt Book Center, or by calling 
the Playhouse at 621-4445.

Side Story might have been more effective in black and white with 
color sequences. The King and I, however, might not have been if 
20th Century Fox had tried to film it in Bangkok. Although the movie 
is lavish and has some lush scenery, even if most of it is painted, I 
somehow remember the play as being more lavish than the movie, 
if for no other reason that on a stage a painted drop is a painted 
drop while in a film it is a painted attempt at reality.
It is a little disillusioning to find that the Siam of the movie 
was two-dimensional and painted, but somehow this cardboard Siam 
has more reality than, for instance, the real Cambodia of Lord Jim. 
Playing a musical against a painted vista is perhaps one way of 
making the artificiality of this form of theatre work on the screen. 
Whether or not it was intentional, the painted scenery of the movie 
comes off as meticulously painted scenery, making it resemble a 
movie with Baroque scenery. In a romantic movie like the King and
I, it works. In West Side Story, it didnt. If the Sound of Music had 
not been shot mainly on location in Salzburg, it might have been 
as deadly on the screen as the play was on stage. When you place 
two dimensional people in front of two dimensional scenery, the 
result is, well, two dimensional. The Sound of Music has always im
pressed me as a distillation of the King and I, trying to put frosting 
on a bowl of Eastern spices.
THE FILM, WHICH JUST ENDED A REISSUE RUN at the Man
or, somehow managed to survive the translation from the stage to 
the screen. Ernest Lehman, who was responsible for the screen
play, stayed relatively close to the stage script, only changing seauence when the fluidity of the film could allow a scene that the 
limitations of moving stage scenery had to hold off until the set was 
changed. Mr. Lehman has been responsible for the screenplays of 
West Side Story, the Sound of Music, and Whos Afraid of Virginia 
Woolf. The print of the film re-issued managed to cut three songs 
which are on the soundtrack recording and which I recall hearing 
back in 58 or .59 when the movie originally played Pittsburgh.
Its been about ten years since the film was made and the pass
age of ten years has damaged the show very little. Yul Brynner 
won an Oscar for his repeat of his stage performance as the King 
of Siam. It is a fine performance. Deborah Kerr, charmingnever 
insipiduses Marni Nixons singing voice well. The score is one of 
the best Rogers and Hammerstein ever wrote, possibly because it 
has nothing to do with applie pie and Americana.
THE HIGH POINT OF THE FILM is Jerome Robbins ballet, 
The Small House of Uncle Thomas, a quasi-Siamese version of 
Uncle Toms Cabin. Since the ballet is a stage performance in the 
context of the movie, no attempt was made to completely cinematize 
it, but the techniques used to make it cinematic should be a lesson 
to Paul Czinner before he films any more of the Royal Ballets per
formances.
It will be interesting to see West Side Story, Mary Poppins, or 
the Sound of Music in ten years or so. Musicals dont always wear as 
well as the King and L Gigi, for example, which played at the Manor 
about four weeks ago is like champagne gone flat. This spin-off of 
My Fair Lady has some nice music, most of which was cut from 
My Fair Lady, but the screen play is a bore. This musical won nine 
Oscars, including Best Picture.

Senate Votes Military Ball 
April 7 All'Campus Event
At its meeting last Tuesday, Student Senate voted to 
make the annual Military Ball an all-school event. In other 
proceedings, the General Campus Committee revealed that 
the bookstore in Baker Hall will not be renovated until
next June.
The Military Ball, staged by 
the students in ROTC is sched
uled for April 7, 1967, at Carne
gie Music Hall in Oakland. Mak
ing it an all-school event means 
that it is open to the whole stu
dent body, and also that no other 
parties or events can be held on 
campus until 11 pm the night of 
the ball.
Bookstore Must Wait
According to the General Cam
pus Committees report, renova
tion of the bookstore cannot start 
until next June because it would 
be impractical to work on the 
bookstore while classes are in 
session. It would probably have 
to be closed down.
The post office, adjacent to 
the bookstore, may be moved 
before the end of the school 
year, though. This would possi
bly give the bookstore more 
storage space.
A proposal was brought before
Senate to tear out the front wall 
of the bookstore and use the en
tire basement area up to the 
stairs for the store. It was noted, 
however, that this idea may be 
impractical because of fire reg
ulations.
Vending Machines
General Campus Committee is 
currently looking into the feasi
bility of installing vending ma
chines in the various academic 
buildings, particularly Baker Hall. 
The Committee is also trying to 
have classrooms in these build
ings left open for study over the 
weekends and on weekday eve
nings.

Tom Moore, chairman of the

Anthone Review
Dos Discos Nuevos
by Tony Lawrence
NINA SIMONE is a very unusual and varied singer for she is 
quite non-committal in her singing. It is difficult to label her as 
folk, rock, blues, ballad, or a combination of both, perhaps one from 
column a, two from column b, etc. To be on the safe side, it 
is probably best to simply call her one of the best singers (second 
only to Ella Fitzgerald) around.
In her new album titled: NINA SIMONE, WILD IS THE WIND 
she certainly runs the gamut of versatility. The song featured on 
Ihe album is her own, called Four Women, a haunting almost morose 
song which quite frankly left me with very little. The other song 
on the album that she arranged is Black is the Color of My True 
Loves Hair and is excellent.. The title song (written by Ned Wash
ington and Dimitri Tiomkin from the film of the same name) is a 
full seven minutes and could have been shorter. The truly redeem
ing ingredient in the record is her fabulous deliverance of Lilac 
Wine sung with much the same style as one of her first hit records: 
Porgy, which is still considered a classic and by todays standards 
is no less than unforgettable.
Nina Simone began her career as a songstress in 1957 with a 
song called Local Rumble and shortly thereafter became an estab
lished chanteuse with the above mentioned Porgy for which she also 
did the arrangements.
ALTHOUGH THERE ARE a couple of songs (namely I LOVE 
Your Lovin Ways and If I Should Lose You) that are not quite up 
to par, NINA SIMONE: WILD IS THE WIND still reinforces the well 
established fact that Miss Simone is indeed a singer for all seasons. 
This new record is on the Phillips label and is available in either 
Monophonic-PHM 200-207 or Stereo-PHS 600-207.
Quite often French popular music has a tendency to become 
slightly non-descript; beautiful and lovely but nevertheless non
descript. Francis Lais original sound track from A MAN AND A 
WOMAN (On United Artists-High Fidelity UAL 4147, Stereo UAS 
5147) is an exception. The music is a bit similar to that of The Um
brellas of Cherbourg composed by Michele Legrand but it has a dis
tinct quality of its own which must contribute greatly to the impact of 
the film (which I havent seen).
Some of the more recent attempts at giving a film a clever, 
commercially salable sound track have failed because the people 
responsible try too many gimmicks such as including bits of dialogue 
with the record or having impressive, complex picture fold-outs 
all of which the listener could care less about. A MAN AND A 
WOMAN does not do this and is subsequently a delightful, musical 
creation and an asset to any record collection.

M IS FOR THE MANY THINGS
YOULL TEACH HER
Nobody will disputesurely not Ithat raising children 
is a task which requires full time and awesome skills. 
Nonetheless, a recent nationwide survey has revealed a 
startling fact: mothers who go back to work after their 
children are safely through the early years are notably 
happier, better adjusted, and more fulfilled than mothers 
who simply remain housewives. Moreoverand mark this 
wellthe children of such working mothers are themselves 
happier, better adjusted, and more fulfilled!
All very well, you say, but whats it got to do with you ? 
Isnt it obvious ? If you are underachieving at college, get 
your mother a job.
What kind of job? Well sir, your mother is probably 
between 35 and 50 years of age, so certain occupations 
must immediately be ruled out. Logging, for example. Or 
whaling. Or carhopping.
But dont despair. There are other kinds of jobsnot 
many, to be sure, but some. However, you must not stick 
Mom in just any old job. You must remember that after 
the excitement of raising you, she would be bored to tears 
as a file clerk, for instance, or as a dolman. (A dolman, as 
we all know, is someone who brings handfuls of water to 
track layers. With the recent invention of the pail, dolmen 
are gradually falling into technological unemployment.)
But I digress. I was saying, find Mom a job worthy of 
her talents, something challenging that uses her vast wis
dom and experience but, at the same time, is not too hard 
on her obsolescing tissues. Thats what Walter Sigafoos 
did, and the results were brilliantly successful.
Walter, a sophomore at the Upper Maryland College of 
Wickerwork and Belles Lettres, majoring in raffia, ap
proached the problem scientifically. First he asked himself 
what his mother did best. Well sir. what she did best was 
to keep hollering, Dress warm, Walter!
At first glance this seemed a skill not widely in demand, 
but Walter was not discouraged. He sent out hundreds of 
inquiries and today, I am pleased to report, his mother is 
happily employed as wardrobe mistress for the Montreal 
Canadiens.
Another fortunate venture was that of Frank C. Gransmire, a junior at the Oregon State Conservatory of Music 
and Optometry, majoring in sties. Frank, like Walter, did 
a survey in depth of his mothers talents. Chief among 
them, he found, was her ability to make a roast of beef 
feed the whole family for three days. So, naturally, Frank 
got her a job at the Museum of Natural History.
What has one to do with the other, you ask? Isnt it 
obvious ? Anyone who can stretch ribs like that belongs in 
paleontology.

I cannot conclude this column without saving a few 
words about Personna Super Stainless Steel Blades. The 
reason I cannot is that this column is sponsored by the 
makers of Personna Super Stainless Steel Blades, and 
they are inclined to get peckish if I omit to mention their 
product.
Not, mind you, that it is a chore for me to plug 
Personna. Or, for the matter of that, to shave with 
Personna. No sir: no chore. Personna takes the pain out 
of shaving, scraps the scrape, negates the nick, repudiates 
the rasp, peels the pull, boycotts the burn, blackballs the 
bite, ousts the ouch. Furthermore, Personna endures and 
abides, gives you luxury shave after luxury shave, day 
after day after day. And further furthermore, Personna 
is available both in double-edge style and Injector style. 
And as if all this were not bounty enough, Personna is 
now offering you a chance to grab a fistful of $100 bills! 
Stop at your Personna dealer and get an entry blank for 
the new Personna Super Stainless Steel Sweepstakes. But 
hurry! Time is limited.

250 in the varsity division and 
Leighton Westlake with 251 in 
the ROTC division. Damberg was 
34th in a field of 64, and West
lake, 17th in a field of 63. Sev
eral factors should be mentioned, 
not by way of apology but rather 
comment. During the match all 
teams were competing on the 
highly competitive International 
targets, furthering the differences 
that separated the individuals 
and the teams were small.
Just this past weekend on their 
home range, the Tartans beat 
Duquesne and St Francis in a 
three way match. The scores for 
the Teams were Tech, 1,394; Du
quesne, 1,361; and St. Francis, 
1,296. The Tech team was led in 
the match by sophomore Bruce 
McKelvy with a 281. Putting in 
their usual good performances 
were Capt. Dick Damberg with a 
280 and Ted Mankovich also with 
a 280. Fred Klein shot 278 after 
a weak prone of 95.
Thus far in the Western Penn
sylvania Rifle League Tech owns 
a record of 6-0. Their next match 
will be with Washington & Jeffer
son on December 2 in Washing
ton, Pa.

WARA Begins 
Volleyball Season
The WARA volleyball team 
began its seasons activities this 
past week with home games 
with Slippery Rock and Seton Hill. 
The team also attended a sportsday at California State. Tuesday 
evenings game with Slippery 
Rock ended with The Rock 
victorious 15-5, 15-8. Miss Griffiths, 
the S.R. coach, said that she has 
been coaching her girls in power-volleyball which concentrates 
on developing a good over-hand 
serve, the use of fists exclusively 
and powerful spikes. The Tech 
girls got in their points by using 
semi-p owe r-volleyball since 
some of the girls can serve over
hand, and Cathy Hill and Mar
garet Markle, both freshmen, can 
spike.
In Thursdays matches with 
Seton Hill, the Tartettes showed 
some team-volleyball and took 
both matches 15-12, 16-14, and 2-15, 
15-13, 15-8. After taking only two 
games to beat Seton Hill in the 
first match, the Tech girls re
laxed and lost the first game of 
the second match; however, aft
er a few volleyball cheers and a 
pep-coaching talk from the coach. 
Miss Mary Ellen Hirsch, the girls 
settled down and won the second 
match with relative ease.
On Saturday the team parti
cipated in a California State Col
lege Do-it-Yourself  volleyball 
sportsday. In the Sportsday, 12 
colleges from the area competed 
in semi-regular games (8 min. 
games) with every other college. 
Tech came out with a record of 
2-11 beating Bethany and a team 
made up of the college advisors. 
The first, second and third place 
teams were Frostburg (Md.), 
West Liberty (W. Va.) and Thiel 
respectively. Other participating 
teams were from California State, 
Waynesburg College, Geneva Col
lege, Chatham College, Indiana 
State University, Slippery Rock 
State College, and Seton Hill Col
lege.
Basketball Season To Begin
December 1 At Pitt
New Head Coach Moe Fassinger has five lettermen returning from last years 
Carnegie Tech basketball team, as the Tartans prepare for the start of the 1966-67 bas
ketball campaign, which opens December 1, against Pitt at the Field House. 
Fassinger replaced Mel Cratsley this year after having served with Mel as an as
sistant coach at Tech for 17 years. Last years team compiled the best won-lost record 
in the schools history, 16-6, so Moe is stepping into a rather tough spot.
Jeff Kalin, who has amassed
857 in varsity seasons, and Ray 
Burdett, Techs finest defensive 
player, have been named co-cap. 
tains for the coming year. Kalin, 
from Eastlake, Ohio, was sec' 
ond in scoring last season with a 
15.9 per game average, and lead 
the team in rebounds with 227 
in ten games. He has been the 
teams most valuable player for 
the past two seasons and is a 
past all-district selection.
Burdett, who observers say is 
the most improved offensive play
er on the team, has earned two 
letters, and is considered by Fas
singer to be about the finest de
fensive player he has ever coach
ed. The Ford City native scored
The season is over. How successful it was is, of course, an 
opinion that varies from person to person. To some, a 5-3 record is 
not too overly impressive, especially when compared to the crosscountrys 9-0, but, to others, including rtyself, the season is regard
ed as a victory in itself and something that all Tech students can 
be proud of.
For six Tech students, however, it was the end of an irreplaceable 
experience that they will long treasure. These men were, of course, 
Pete Bair, Paul Beshenick, Jim Clark, Ken Gianni, Bill Patula, and 
John Polles, the senior members of the 1966 Tartan football team 
Pete Bair, described by coach Joe Gasparella as my best offensive 
lineman. He is a member of the civil engineering department and is 
a resident of the East Liberty Section of Pittsburgh.
Paul Beshenick, who midway through last season had never be
fore played college football, quickly learned the ways of the game 
and earned a starting position within two weeks. He was voted the 
most valuable lineman in this years Homecoming game and has 
been one of the tri-captains on this years squad. He is a member of 
the electrical engineering department and a resident of Pittsburgh.
Jim Clark of Clairton, Pa., finished his third year in the end 
position for Tech. He is majoring in administration and management 
science.
Ken Gianni of Bridgeville, Pa., also completed his third year 
of varsity football at Tech. He was used by Coach Joe Gasparella 
primarily as a defensive back. He also is majoring in administration 
and management science.
Bill Patula, the other tri-captain of the Tartans, completed his 
fourth varsity season. He was used primarily as offensive guard but 
was pressed into defense in many crucial situations. Bill is from 
Munhall and is a math major.
John Polles finished his final season for Tech in his favorite 
halfback position. He is a resident of Copley, Ohio, and is a chemis
try major.
The most valuable player for Tech was Larry Getto. Getto was 
outstanding, not only on offense as a fullback, but also on defense 
as a linebacker. Getto lead the Tartans in rushing and kickoff returns 
and, said Joe Gasparella, has contributed at least as much on de
fense as on offense.
So, for the first time this decade, Carnegie Tech had a winning 
football team. The long held sports apathy has partially given way 
to an interest in the team. The team will, of course, be hurt very 
badly by the loss of its seniors, but it will not be crippled. It will 
return once again next year with as much promise of success as 
this one. The era of the single-win football season is, at least for 
the present, quit dead.
155 points last season for a seven 
point per game average.
Two other regulars, last years 1 
freshman star Mark Lang, from 
South Hills Catholic High School, 
who was labeled as the best 
sixth man around last season, 
as he scored 243 points and grab
bed 192 rebounds, and jumpingjack Don Keefer, the most ac
curate shooter on the team are ^ 
also back to make Moes life just 
a little easier. In three years, 
Keefer has hit an amazing 189 
of 392 shots from the field, a ca
reer field goal percentage of 483.
The other returning letterman 
is junior Neil Houser, who will 
probably be the fifth starter. 
Houser, a native of Ellwood City, ^ 
has been used sparingly during 
his two years of varsity play, but 
did earn a letter last season. He 
is a good but erratic player, who 
must settle down if he is to help.
Moes biggest concern seems to 
be a lack of depth. Currently, his 
top three subs are all sophomores. ( 
Barry Hummel, who averaged 
over 17 points per game for the 
freshman team seems to be the 
first inside sub, and Leigh DeHuff 
and John Meister are in line as 
the key .outside reserves. DeHuff, 
from Bethel Park, averaged about 
seven points per game for the j 
frosh, while Meiser scored 11 per 
game. Both Hummel and Meiser 
did see limited varsity action 
last season. Tech plays a 23 game 
schedule this season and it looks 
as though the biggest obstacle to 
a repeat of last year is the lack 
of depth. While only two seniors 
are gone from the 1965-66 team, 
one, Ray Morrison was the teams 
scoring leader, and the other, 
66 Jim Brown, finished third on 
the squad in both scoring and re
bounding.
In the Walsh Invitational held on the 11th and 12th 
of November, Carnegie Tech made a solid showing in both 
the varsity and ROTC divisions. Competing with 19 other 
schools, Tech placed seventh out of the 14 schools shooting 
in the varsity division and 11th out of 14 among the schools 
firing in the ROTC division. Among the schools that Tech 
bettered were Marshal, Eastern Kentucky, and Miami of 
Oxford in the ROTC division,
and Duquesne, Eastern Kentucky, 
and University of Indiana at
Bloomington in the Varsity division.
