The judges gave a maximum of 250 points for each of the above.The Tartan was awarded 225 points for news values, 260 points for news writing, 255 points for makeup, and 230 points for departmental features.Special recognition was given 
for over-all coverage and good story organizations. The judges commented that, Page one has a lot of reader interest from a makeup point of view, and the sports coverage is outstandings.It was suggested, that the paper try to obtain more features on departmental activities and the schools history. The judges also believed that the editorials were too long (this was before the length was reduced by using a cartoon). 
Almost every collegiate newspaper in the country was entered in the contest, which is conducted twice each year. The Tartan has

New Musical 
At Playhouse
Dance For Joy, the new Pittsburgh Playhouse musical which 
opened at the Craft avenue thea
ter last week, was written by autor G. Wood, a Carnegie drama 
graduate, especially with with 
veteran Playhouse actress Pearl Hipps in mind.
Wood, who has written the mu
sic, lyrics, and dialogue for this new musical, first saw Pearl Hipps 
in last springs Playhouse show 
Wonderful Good and at that 
time thought it might be unique to write a musical starring a character actress.
With that as a start. Wood con
ceived this idea of a retired de
partment store clerk who fulfills a life-long ambition by enrolling in a ballroom dance studio.

WaffenSS Marches Again; 
French Hatred Glowing
Loans
Upperclass students need
ing long-term loans for the 
Spring Semester should place 
their application in the Dean 
of Students Office, AH 150, no 
later than January 5, 1953.
by Professor Robert Schwarz
This month word came from Germany of a thought-compelling in
cident. It was the homecoming day of the so-called Waffen-SS, 
Nazi black shirts who had often been used as shock troops by the 
German high command in the last war. The purpose of the re-union 
was to renew comradeship and to help trace lost members. The 
speechmaking turned into a political tirade against the former ene
mies of Hitler Germany, especially the Western allies, and into a 
strong appeal for the restoration of facism. Attempts to dampen 
the jingoism of the main speaker, General Ramcke, and subsequent 
assurances that the views expressed were not those of the official 
federal republic, indeed, not even those of the German veteran 
organizations, could not ease the worry of the world which the words 
of General Ramcke and the parade of the SS elicited.
Very Inopportune Time
This resurgence of Nazi sentiment comes at a time which could 
not be more inopportune for the West German government. The most 
delicate and precarious negotiations with France, Britain, and the 
United States over the Saar, the Schuman plan, and the European 
army are in progress. Powerful factions in France oppose con
cessions to Germany in any event; other groups are half-ready to 
co-operate with Germany because of American pressure and recogni
tion of dire need to work with the Germans. Even in Germany itself 
there is a tremendous undercurrent of opposition to postponing Ger
man unifications as a sacrifice for collaboration with the West. And 
in the midst of these deliberations which even at their best oper
ate in the shadow of failure, ammunition is provided for those who 
have warned of the danger of a re-armed Germany.
Groups who otherwise stand on clearly divergent sides of poli
tical and economic issues tend to agree, albeit for different reasons, 
that to establish a strong Germany is not an intelligent idea. To 
the right wing parties in France a strong Germany is traditionally 
anathema. The left wing parties see a restoration of the peril of 
aggression and political reaction in a militarily rehabilitated Ger
many. The left wing parties in Germany hate the very idea of Nazi 
vestiges and a revival of the German general staff. To this con
glomeration of views is now added the view of the Nazis that to co
operate with the West is to invite disaster for Germany.
Has Many Effects
Where does the United States stand in this matter? Clearly a 
resurrection of Nazism is a heavy blow to our foreign policy. Besides, 
Generals Eisenhower and Ridgway have repeatedly said that Ger
manys participation in Europes defense is indispensable. The United 
States has had much difficulty in preventing a break-down of deliber
ations and French disaffection, even before these conspicuous signs 
of a re-awakened National Socialism. It has an even harder task now. 
Add to that the decreasing popularity of the United States in Ger
many resulting from the conviction of many Germans that this coun
try has trained German cut-throats to undertake political assassina
tions; add the recent French antagonism to America on the question 
of Indo-China; add to it the election of the ex-Nazi leader Schepmann 
to the county council of lower Saxony; and it becomes plain that 
the rising of the Nazi ghost would jeopardize the success of our 
entire European policy to a critical degree.
Military Ball Budget 
Brought Before Council
Last Wednesdays Student Council meeting opened witfe a stern 
reproof of various Council members by its president, Dick Franklin. 
Franklin said that some SC members were neglecing their duties. 
Thereupon he asked for the resignation of those members who felt
they could not carry out their du-' 
ties efficiently.
Budget chairman Ray Sebulsky 
reported that the tearing down of 
Alleghenys goal posts cost the 
Tech students $75. He also made 
a motion to put $60 in Student Councils budget for the next year 
in order that awards could be giv
en to freshmen for passing the 
traditions test. The motion was 
defeated.
Next Sebulsky brought the 
budget for the Military Ball be
fore Student Council. Because the budget was turned in late, Student Council had a long discussion try
ing to decide whether to approve 
it. A motion was made to suspend 
the Ball, but it was defeated.
Parking committee chairman Goetzman made a report to Coun
cil stating that there was adequate parking facilities for all Tech students. He said the reason 
that some students have a diffi
cult time parking is that they do 
not utilize the FPHA parking lot. 
Also, many fraternity men drive

ternities on campus. Through CFP 
the fraternities aided Mortar 
Board with the decorations for 
Homecoming dance. During the 
last few weeks, Council has par

drive.
Also, under the direction of 
Lloyd Grace, the Inter fraternity 
Pledge Council has again been organized. This body has done much to bring about a better under
standing among the pledge classes 
on campus. It has arranged for exchange dinners and sponsored the pledge cheer contest at the Homecoming pep rally.
Plans are now being made for 
the social events that will come 
up during the second semester. The annual CFP formal will be 
held on January 10, with Tex 
Beneke furnishing danceable music and entertainment. Syria Mos
que has been reserved for the formal.
Early in the spring Greek Sing 
and Swing will be held. This has tentatively been set for March 13 
and 14. The rules and song lists 
will be out in a couple of weeks.
The officers for this semester are: A1 DeVido, president; Tom Nathan, vice-president; Bob Steiger, secretary; and Guy Wilson, treasurer.

Info Given 
About Draft
A representative from the re
cruiting service will speak to the 
students of Tech in order to ori
entate and better familiarize them 
with the different types of training available in the U. S. air force and U. S. army.
There seems to be no great gap 
between the time students graduate or discontinue their education and the time they receive 
their notice by the draft board to report for a pre-induction physi
cal. Dut to the increased draft quota, these students are given induction notice three weeks to a month subsequent to their physical examination.
After a man receives his preinduction physical he has the prerogative to volunteer for any 
branch of service. But three weeks 
to a month is not sufficient time for any one to volunteer for a specific type of training and be 
processed for acceptance. By specific training is meant training such as aircraft pilot, aircraft observer, officer candidate, etc.
A plan has been formulated, whereby anyone desiring information concerning the U. S. army and 
air force or the draft submit his question to the Tartan office. They 
will be answered by the repre
sentative when he addresses the students, on some later date.

Puppet entertains dramats * * * * * * 
Dramats See Puppets, 
Course To Be Started
by Bob Livingston
Last Tuesday the drama department had the good fortune to 
witness a fascinating demonstration of puppeteering. Erhard Reis, 
German exchange visitor, gave the group a short lecture and clever 
performance concerning puppet-life.
In his brief talk, Mr. Reis discussed the differences between the 
German hero-puppet, Kasper, (do-gooder) and our well-known 
protaganist, Punch. Kasper tries to bring his audience into the play 
through plot, dialogue and side-speeches, making them an emotional 
force to help guide the characters, rather than to merely watch the

aper.
Editors note: In a recent exploration of the catacombs deep be
neath Engineering hall, several curious relics were uncovered among 
the abandoned burrettes and thistle tubes lying there. Amidst these 
materials were found three bottle openers, a second hand prayer 
wheel, and a sheaf of yellow parchments which may prove to be 
the most startling literary find since the sensational Porter Hall 
Confidenial.
The papers referred to are the personal writings of one Medulla 
Oblongata, a friendly hermit who spent 43 years living six floors below 
the metallurgy department on locusts and dried flies. Rumor has it 
that he would not have lived as long as he did had not an unnamed 
waitress from Skibo supplied him with foodstuffs during his existence 
at Carnegie Tech.
During the next few weeks, the TARTAN will publish selected
items from Oblongatas writings, which contain much homely, and
often downright ugly, philosophy.* * *
The Basket Case.
Translated from the Original Armenian by R. Durstine
Once, several years ago, there lived in a little village in the 
middle eastern part of Pennsylvania a good natured young fellow 
named Cosmo Q. Arachnid. Mr. Arachnid had had, ever since .he 
could remember, just one burning desire, the irresistible urge to do 
something that had never been done before, and was not likely to 
be done again. \ ?-------------- 'He did not care particularly what this might be, so long as his lifes work met his exacting requirements for uniqueness.So, the day following his twenty-first birthday, Mr. Arachnid decided to devote his life to the study of humorous stories, and set 
out to compile a complete list of all the funny writings, sayings, and thoughts that had been created by man since the beginning of time. *As he gathered these items together, he classified them according to time, place, and person of, and reason for origin. He hoped finally to compile the most complete cross index of humor that had ever been conteived, so that future writers, speakers, and thinkers would not have to waste 
their time creating humorous interludes to light their otherwise drab and uninteresting lives.By the time Mr. Arachnid was 74 he had material for 718 volumes of funny stories, 345 collections of 
witty sayings for all occasions, 476 
books full of retorts to these sayings, and innumerable pleasant 
thoughts that one could think when feeling in need of good cheer.On top of all this, he had compiled a total of 879 volumes of indices to correlate his books, and 76 volumes of further indices to 
index the first indices.Needless to say, Mr. Arachnid was rather tired by the end of 
these 53 years.
To achieve his final triumph, Mr. Arachnid sgnt his collected efforts to a publisher, with the request that his books be made available to the world so that it might enjoy them. He then sat back to wait the answer and any small remuneration that might accompany it, for besides being tired, Mr. Arachnid was quite hungry.
Six days later, Mr. Arachnid received a package in the mail and paid $69.87 postage due (which sum he received from a sympathetic neighbor) upon its arrival. In the package were his writings, returned from the publisher, together with a polite letter advising his lhat only a week previously the publishing house had accepted a collection of humorous stories that contained a total of 17 more funny items than did Mr. Arachnids.
Mr. Arachnid felt crushed.But he decided to make the best of it, and sat down by his hearth with his pet anteater, Dido, and started to read all the funny stories 
he had compiled.
Previously he had been too busy for such recreation.And so he continued until he reached the ripe age of 109, when he died from exhaustion after 34 minutes of solid laughter while 
reading a book of anecdotes.
Moral: Dont put all your eggs 
in one basket unless you are par
ticularly fond of eggs.
The plays are produced with children in mind. However, there are adults plays in which more forceful characters are used and 
a more profound plot suggested. The puppets are typed into good and bad categories, and with a 
series of slides, Mr. Reis explained the uses of such characters.
A master of string puppets, too, Mr. Reis then manipulated his naturally known marionette, clown Eddi. The high spot of the demonstration came when the puppetter went behind his newly built, modern puppet-stage and presented Kasper. Uncanny effects were obtained and after a few 
minutes, the puppets appeared to be human with their mischiev
ous antics on the small stage.The drama department intends to open a course of puppetry which Mr. Reis will teach. The students will actually produce a play (for school presentation) un
der the direction of their teacher. In his homeland, Mr. Reis is known nationally as a producer 
of puppet shows, teacher of puppetry, and author of several published books on puppeteering.

GDI Briefly Appears 
After Periodic Absence
by Bill Minkler
Various sources believe that a movement is in progress to reor
ganize the Gamma Delta Iota society, which disbanded a few 
years ago. Signs bearing the societys initials have appeared in 
the stands at recent football games, and at least one person has
been conducting a membership 
drive in the freshman 1A section.
GDI was founded in the latrine across from AH 208 in the fall of 1942, according to a former char
ter member now closely associated with the Tbch faculty. He said there were auout 20 members in the original group.
The society was formed, he revealed, when many independent students grew tired of hearing 
people say, Is he a so-and-so? No, he joined so-and-so.
This original group was not especially active, but the members did chalk up their insignia on 
blackboards and sidewalks. The chairmanship rotated daily from member to member.
The 1942 organization dissolved 
and was not reorganized until the fall of 1949. The members of the 1949 GDI, however, disclaim any 
connection with the old club. A spokesman for the group said he never even knew there was a 
GDI chapter previous to 1949.
The new GDI was a benevolent society for the benefit of its mem
bers. It began when the inde
pendent students of freshman section 1A decided to hold a social 
function for themselves. They en
listed other interested people, mostly freslimen and sophomores, and soon meetings were being held 
every few weeks in the recreation room of Henderson hall.
The club worked actively on 
behalf of the independent candidates in the fall of 1949 Student Council election. It also painted a 
prominent post in front of Skibo an odd shade of purple, in honor 
of exams. Its members attended football games with their GDI 
plaque, and promoted good fellowship.
The organization disbanded again in the spring of 1951, 
when all but two of its members joined fraternities.

course) about our school set-up; first about leaving 
books outside the bookstore, and then about ath
letic department policy.Now it seems to me that 
moaning is a great steam letter-offer, but also that 
it is a good idea to blow off in a useful direction. 
Unquestionably there are lots of things wrong here, 
but one of the main ones is an oversupply of mal
contents.
A primary objective of this place seems to be 
to provide a systematic, well-rounded education; 
to the athletic dept, this means conformation of 
gym clothes and a working knowledge of a few 
games. I, for one, am all for it. School spirit is 
essentially school pride, and to watch a gym class 
neatly dressed, and who look as if they know what 
they are doing, gives one a feeling of pride.
Lets at least be constructive in our criticism.

EX PRIN CDT Tin YRSi y
Councilidiocy
Editor, the Tartan:
It seems to me that our much-discussed Student 
Council could find more and better things to do 
than debate the merit of cancelling the Military 
Ball merely because of a breach of operating pro
cedure in preparations for the dance.
Certainly it is not to Councils discredit that it 
defeated unanimously a motion to suspend the ball, 
or that it finally approved the budget which Scab
bard and Blade belatedly presented for its formal 
dance. But not much good can be said for the fact 
that Council members pondered long on these de
cisions, trying to decide whether it would be best 
to let the dance go on as scheduled or not.
Though there is merit in SCs desire to have 
its by-laws adhered to, and to have all social 
budgets presented three weeks before the event, 
there could certainly have been no advantage in 
refusing the budget or cancelling the Military Ball 
just to prove this point to the public.
More than likely such action would have proved 
only that Council consists of some twenty-odd peo
ple with their heads up their respective sleeves, 
an impression it would be wTeIl for our esteemed 
student government to avoid as much as possible.
Fortunately no damage was done in this case, 
and no-one so much as voted to suspend the event, 
but the discussion that preceded the votes on the 
issues either shows much stir over nothing or a vast 
amount of ignorance on the part of one group 
that should certainly have some idea of what is 
coming off on this campus.
Yours truly,
R. Durstine

CIT Needs A King
Thanks to the military honorary, Scabbard & Blade, CIT 
students had a chance to look at an interesting bulletin board 
display last week. Such a queen campaign is rather simple 
to conduct and yet incites almost as much interest in the 
student body as some of the more vigorous tussles in the 
spring semester. By the time this year becomes history 
there will have been many elections for a queen to repre
sent some idea or phase of campus life, but the girls may 
never get a chance to elect a king to reign over CIT.
For the past few years Mortar Board has made numer
ous attempts to sell the Council of Fraternity Presidents on 
having a King of Hearts election, and each year CFP finally 
gives in after first moaning about all the work involved in 
campaigning. Yet, each year the stunts at Morewood and 
Skibo become more elaborate. If the fraternities are so un
willing to have a King of Hearts, why do they have to con
duct such intensive campaigns? The Military Queen elec
tion shows that a relatively simple campaign can still arouse 
enough campus interest to make it interesting.
It isnt too fair to the female element of our student body 
to make the poor girls conduct two or three campaigns during 
the year in order to draw out the male vote; and they are never 
given the chance to sit back and have someone beg for their 
vote. Several have said that this argument is rather silly 
when studied by the mature mind. No matter how old any 
person is, he doesnt like to work all the time for someone else 
and never have the privilege of sitting on the other side of the 
fence. In fact the nearness of one of these elections to the other 
has often prompted the campaigners in the other to go all out.
When the time rolls around for the Carnival Queen elec
tion, all the fraternity men began to judge each sorority 
by the amount of work put into its campaign and how many 
personal favors such as shoe shining, cakes, and cigarettes 
it offers. Although the fraternity men are too lazy to con
duct an all-out campaign, they feel it perfectly all right to 
expect the sororities to put all their time and effort into 
the Queen campaign.
Since every Greek is kept pretty busy during the Spring 
Carnival season building floats, buggies, and booths, there 
may be some justification in the idea that fraternities 
shouldnt have to conduct as extensive a campaign as the 
sororities do. Maybe we should have the King of Hearts 
election during the fall semester instead of in the spring.
However, the time is getting near when the officers of 
CFP and Mortar Board are going to have to decide whether 
we will have a King of Hearts elections this year, and it is 
our feeling that they owe it to the students. If the fellows 
feel that theyre justified in easing up on the caliber of the 
campaigning, they should still be willing to conduct King of 
Hearts on the level of the Military Queen election. All it 
would require is the candidate posing for his picture, and 
then having his fraternity brothers or dorm mates posting 
them. Or, the pictures could be turned over ter the Mortar 
Board and it could display them in the same manner as 
Scabbard & Blade did. The whole works could be conducted 
with a minimum of effort, and by the time the Saturday 
dance was finished everyone would be happy, and our campus 
queen wouldnt have to rule this broad domain all alone.
Inquiring Reporter
Seeks Explanation 
Of School Spirit
by Ken Winston
The question asked by the Inquiring reporter thi* 
week was as follows: What do you think srould 
be done to increase the school spirit at Tech?**
Arthur Brown, graduate, printingI feel that 
an important reason for any lack 
of spirit is the absence of integ
ration between schools. Th ar
chitects think of the school as 
the Carnegie school of architec
ture, the printers as the Carne
gie school of printing, tand so on, 
having little idea of what goes 
on in other departments as well 
as what are the requisites of a 
dramatist, artist, or architect.
A possible remedy might be 
required tours through all the other departments 
together with fairly searching lectures on what 
sort of work and knowledge lies behind degrees 
in the departments.
Norman Berkow, junior, printing manage
mentsFrom the time I first en
tered this school I heard of the 
mighty Tech teams from before 
1939, and included the many 
overwhelming victories by these 
teams. Since that time the teams 
playing capabilities have fallen 
enormously due to the lack of 
athletic scholarships and the 
many veterans here.
As I understand, this fall 
has been accompanied by a fall 
of school spirit. A logical conclusion then would 
be to give athletic scholarships again, but this is 
^gainst school policy. So therefore as the main 
Tech interests are scholastic, the only other logical 
answer is such attempts as sponsored game rallies 
and the pep squad.
The only part of the school open to interest 
this way is the dorms and the fraternities. Were 
the fraternities stronger in their school spirit at 
all times, acting as a core of school spirit, then 
the dorn men and women would fall in behind 
them. I hold no hope for getting the commuters 
to join suit.
The fraternities, because they are organized 
and because of the fraternal spirit which already 
exists, are the logical starting point in a campaign 
to build up school spirit. If the fraternities would 
require their pledges and activities alike to parti
cipate in the school activities, pep rallies, etc., 
school spirit would soar. This is the only practical 
way to increase school spirit because it certainly 
must come from the fraternity men if it is to 
continue at all.
Ernie Schoenfeld, freshman, electrical engineer
ingIn the short time Ive been 
here at Tech, Ive seen evidenced 
quite a bit of spirit. Everyone 
Ive seen seems to have a great 
pride in this school and the 
things about it. Its a good type 
of spirjt. Its more or less un
derlying, but youre aware of it 
never the less.
All that can be done is to 
bring it out a little more by get
ting the activities to know each 
other a little better. The activities are where the 
school spirit starts. Emphasize them and you wake 
up the pride fo their members. Get everybodys 
pride going and the school spirit will take care 
of itself.
Bob Haring, sophomore, chemical engineering
School spirit at Tech is usually 
in the negative. That is, the stu
dent body will readily confirm 
the facts that we dont play top
flight football and we dont have 
a million-dollar student union.
Since school spirit is largely 
a matter of pride, I feel that an 
active campaign should be waged 
by the Tartan, Student Council, 
etc. to make the student b<?dy 
aware and proud of the many 
things that are really important in determining 
the schools value.
We have: widely diversified extracurricular 
activities, excellent facilities for graduate studies, 
nationally recognized drama department, consis
tently high scholastic level required of the under
graduates, and scores of living tributes to Tech, 
the. Carnegie graduate in engineering practice.

Swim Team 
Eager To Go
Sofield Pessimistic 
About Teams Fate
Claude Soiieia s flying fishes are confident that this years team will be as strong, if not stronger, than last years. The 51-52 squad won 6 and lost 3 and then wound up the season with a 1st place in the Tri-State Meet. But Coach Sofield is not so optimistic. I cant predict anything. Right now, there are 28 boys trying out for the squad, but that number changes almost daily, grades, injuries, sickness, and lack of ability or interest taking their toll. With a situation like that, I cant tell who well have, let alone what we will do.Eight Lettermen ReturnSofield does have 14 men returning from last years squad, eight of these lettermen. Leading the pack are seniors Dick Kramer, free-style flash, and Grey Duncan, diving ace. Kramer, who rides the waves like a cork and swims like a fish, holds the record, while Duncan (probably better known as the number one cheerleader) is number one diver and was undefeated last jrear. Only other senior on the squad is Bob Weddell, one of Techs "most dependable point getters and a two letter winner.
Rod MacDonald, Chuck Gough, Bill Aiken, Bob Coulter, and Phil Drew round out the list of lettermen. They will make up this year's n lcleus and will be 
strengthened by returning team mates Bill Prey, Theo Reuther, Rudy Sapper, Bob Fischer, and Bob McQuaid. Dave Chidester, also from last years squad, will have kid brother John to push him, while the other old timers will have their hands full keeping their noses out in front of the large freshman pack. The class of 56 is well represented, with 14 Frosh eager for positions on the Tech squad. Of these Jay Ascher, chem eng and Dave Guzz, chemist, are the most promising.Will Miss DemasCoach, swimmers, and managers Ray Emery and Dick Kendrick all agree on one thingwe wTill miss last years seniors, especially Nick Demas, who was almost always good for a first in the 50 and 100 yard free-style and was anchor man in the relays. The team has been working out since October 27 preparing for the opener with In
diana State Teachers on December 13.Dry land drills (swimmers term for calisthenics) lasted until November 13 when they took to the deep water. If any of the enthusiasm shown in these drills is an indication of things to come, then Tech will have another winner. 
Now since everybody likes to see a winner, stop at the swimming pool Saturday, December 13, at 2 p.m. and watch some exciting races and fine fancy diving.

Anether football year has drawn to a close. The Tartans com
pleted their fourth consecutive victorious season, winning four while 
dropping three, but failed to stimulate student interest to the point
of attending the games en masse.
Sportsdom Lacks School Spirit
The stirring results of our de-emphasized program have been 
quite evident. The stress-scholarship plan is bolstered, the players 
have fun playing, but few people seem to care for our athletics.- 
There is no room for the avid sports fan.
An innovation on this campus, the pep squad has been form
ed in order to promote school spirit. Even our football schedule 
has been revised. California State Teachers College and Bethany 
have been dropped, whereas bigger drawing cards, Westminster 
and Geneva have been added. Our athletic department has even 
contemplated throwing our weekend-by-policy gridders against 
big name teams.
Can the present athletic situation* be modified without disrupt
ing the school de-emphasis policy?
Intramurals Gain Stature 
Intramural sports continue on the upswing. This year there are 
more students participating, and more enthusiasm is being shown 
than ever before.
Some of the crucial football games drew crowds rivalling the 
attendance at some of the varsity games, and one of the fra
ternity teams even had its own band and cheering section.
Sigma Nu emerged as the all school football champions, but were 
defeated by a Duquesne University aggregation in a playoff for the 
city title.
Again this year, the faculty club is represented in the volley
ball competition. The Faculty Bulldogs, composed of pro
fessors Burnall, Birdy, Dorff, Gregg, Haynes, Meachem, Owen, 
Smith, Steinberg, Succop, and Daily, have won four games and 
lost one so far. They are managed by professor Dale Strick. 
Basketball Games Next 
The basketball season is just around the corner.
Coach Mel Cratsley seems to be a bit pessimistic in viewing the 
prospects this year. To quote the coach, The loss of Tommy Beck 
adn Hillary Holste will be keenly felt. Tom Craig and Kaye Thomp
son will be back to help us along. If we get off to a good start, we 
should be able to hold our own.
teams still undefeated. Beta Theta 
Pi, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, and the 
Sekuds have 4-0, 5-0, and 4-0 rec
ords respectively. The Betas won 
two last week while SAE grabbed 
one. The Sekuds downed previ
ously unconquered Theta Xi B 
in a hard fought battle 15-13, 15-9.
Faculty Beaten 
The Sigma Nu A squad gave 
an indication of being the team to 
beat in the Kiltie league race as 
they turned back the powerful 
Faculty group 15-11, 16-14. The 
defeat pushed the Faculty back to 
econd place, with Citcom and 
Roopsips in the show position. 
Citcom decisioned Kappa Sig and 
Roopsips slipped by Delta Tau 
Delta, so both now have 3-1 charts.
ATO Leads 
By racking up three wins last 
week, Alpha Tau Omega A 
moved into the lead in the Plaid league with a 5-0 record. The well-balancedATO squad admin
istered a shellacking to Theta Xi A running up scores of 15-2 and 
15-3. However the Obelisks and Kappa Sig A are still in the 
thick of it and neither has been beaten so far, although they have 
not played as much as ATO. Roopsips B and Theta Xi A 
lost to the Obelisks with Kappa Sig dropping the Slugs.
Table Tennis The Table Tehnis season got off 
to a slow start with just a few 
games being played the first week. The favored and defending champs, ATO, T extended their winning streak by beating the SN team three to one. Other winners 
in the Republican league were Obelisks over BSR B by 3 to 1, and the Phi Kaps over Delta Tau Delta 3 to 2. In the Democratic 
league, the ATO O beat the

Letter Pays! 
Trip Made
Teacher Added to Lab; 
Field Trip To Foundry
Letters to the Editor do pay 
off! The letter of Nov. 17 which 
complained about the understaffed 
mechanical laboratory has result
ed in the addition of one instruc
tor to this important course. It is 
hoped that he will be able to facil
itate the program of studies.
Mr. C. S. Campbell, instructor 
of the equipment and methods 
class, was fortunate in being able 
to arrange a field trip for the 
class through the American Steel 
Foundries plant in Verona. The 
trip proved to be very enlightenf ing, especially from the standpoint 
of the plant layout. A foundry 
plant layout is a term project of 
the class. Mr. R. Anderson, of the 
firm which was visited, is to be 
congratulated on the well con
ducted tour.

In Square Dance
Jo Davidsons Ramblers fur
nished a fine evening of entertain
ment Saturday, November 15. For 
the crowd who attended the 
square dance, Thistle hall proved 
to be of sufficient size to accommo
date the dancers gyrating through 
several novel forms of that great 
American mixer  the square 
dance. After a few simple demon
strations, those who had never in
dulged before were soon able to follow through with some of the intricate steps like old timers.
