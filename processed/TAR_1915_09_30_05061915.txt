Large Crowd Inspects Buildings 
Friday Night.
It was estimated that a crowd of 
seven thousand wandered through the 
buildings on inspection night, Fri
day last, watched the various de
partments at work and left much im
pressed. It would be difficult to 
make an exact statement of the num
ber of visitors, the only basis for es
timating being the fact that from 
seven thirty to ten, the floors of each 
building were filled with admiring 
groups of friends, fathers, mothers, 
sisters, and a very large proportion 
f best girls.
All the buildings were in gala at
tire and were ablaze with lights, pre
senting a most impressive spectacle 
as one crossed the park bridge. New 
lights had been placed in Machinery 
Hall Tower with red lights limiting 
the steam at the exhaust, giving a 
very beautiful effect. It was the first 
time that the visitors had seen the 
new administration building, the M. 
M. C. S. addition. By next year the 
Design building will be completed 
by the addition of the two new wings 
and the dormitories of the Industries 
tower will also have been in operation 
all year.
In Machinery Hall, all the labora
tories were running in full force, the 
new high tension lab being open for 
the first time. The sound of all the 
machinery in operation gave the ef
fect of a large sized plant at work. 
The engines in the power house were 
carrying the heaviest load of the 
year and were all running at full 
speed from the 250 H. P. Westinghouse gas engine to the 500 H. P. 
Ball Compound. The mechanical 
laboratories were a chaos of sound 
and the hum of the electrical ma
chinery in the laboratories above 
prevented ordinary conversation.
The exhibits in the Industries 
Building were the finest ever dis
played. In the printing department 
all the presses and linotypes were in 
operation. On the latter slugs of the 
visitors names were set up and given 
away. One of the presses turned out 
handsomely engraved motto cards 
which were distributed. The letter
ing and engraving on these were de
signed by A. H. McQuilkin, a night 
student, and contained the adage that 
Not what we say, but what we do 
makes test; performance speaks the 
last word and the best.

UNCLE ANDY "GIVES $2,700,009 MORE mm
THE OlFi IS TO Bf ENIIREL DEVOTED TO TECHBaseball Team Bats Heavily and 
Wins, 9 to 3.
Uncle Andys birthday gift, last 
Thursday, to the Carnegie Institute 
of Technology, was $2,700,000. The 
announcement of this additional gift 
by the Founder of the schools was 
made at the Founder Day Exercises, 
held at Carnegie Music Hall, April 
29. This great gift was but another 
wonderful mark of Mr. Carnegies 
love for the schools which he 
founded here in Pittsburgh.
The gift of nearly three millions 
was given to the Carnegie Institute, 
which includes the library, museum 
and schools. After the meeting, how
ever, it was explained by Dr. Samuel 
H. Church, president of the board of 
trustees, that the gift will be entirely 
devoted to extending the buildings of 
Tech and in widening its scope, in 
order that it may better fulfill the 
mission to humanity for which it was 
established.
Of the total sum given, $1,200,000 
will be used to provide new build
ings and $1,500.000 is to be applied 
to the endowment fund. No definite 
plans have as yet been completed for 
the expenditure of the $1.200,000, but 
probably the first use that it will 
be put to will be the meeting of the 
expenses of the extension to the 
School of Design and the School of 
Industries.
Mr. Carnegies donation to the In
stitute now reaches the grand total 
of $27,000,000. This is surely a splen
did monument to his love for the 
people of Pittsburgh.
The Founders Day exercises be
gan at 4 oclock and were presided 
over by Mr. Samuel Harden Church. 
The stage, prescenium and the boxes 
were prettily decorated with potted 
plants, ferns and towering palms. The 
main floor and two balconies were 
well filled with students and with in
vited guests. On the stage were 
seated, besides the president and 
speakers, former Secretary of State 
P. C. Knox, Dr. William H. David
son, Admiral J. S. Martin, of the Ar
gentine Navy, who is in this country 
inspecting a warship ordered by his 
country from a United States ship
building concern, Dr. Samuel B. Mc
Cormick Congressman William H. 
Coleman, and United States Judge 
Joseph Buffington.
Mr. Heinroth, in compliment to 
the presence of the Argentine Am
bassador, played the national hymn 
of the Argentine Republic. President 
Church then'introduced the principal 
speaker of the afternoon, Dr. Romulo S. Naon.
The Ambassadors speech was the 
feature of the afternoon exercises. 
This was a lucid and masterly^iscussion of true Pan-Americanism, 
with many appropriate references of 
that problem to questions growing 
out of the European war. Neither 
Mr. nor Mrs. Carnegie were able to 
attend, owing to the indisposition of 
Mr. Carnegie. President Church 
read the following letter from Mrs. 
Carnegie:
Dear President Church:
It is with the greatest regret that 
Mr. Carnegie and I find ourselves 
unable to be with you on Founders 
Day to meet our dear friends and to 
listen to the distinguished speaker 
the Argentine Ambassador.
As you know, Mr. Carnegie has had 
an attack of grippe and is now suf
fering from its after effects. He is 
recovering and we are greatly en
couraged by his improvement, but 
the doctor still advises complete rest 
and freedom from all workeven let
ter writinghence I hope you will 
allow me to express for us both our 
deep interest in the proceedings of 
the day and our great pleasure in 
the progress and ever-widening influ
ence of the institute.
With our united greetings and good 
wishes, believe me
Most sincerely yours,
LOUISE W. CARNEGIE. 
April 26.
HEARD ON EXHIBITION NIGHT 
IN THE HIGH TENSION 
LAB.
SCHOOL PICNIC.
In a veritable slugfest the Carnegie 
batsmen pounded out fifteen hits and 
easily swamped Heidelburg last Sat
urday by the score of 9 to 3. Most 
of the scoring was done in the last 
three innings. Before that time the 
game stood 3 to 2 and the outcome 
was greatly in doubt. But in the 
seventh inning Pitcher Grabber of 
the home team blew up and allowed 
three hits and a walk, netting three 
runs. Again in the ninth inning the 
Plaid batsmen pounded his delivery 
for four hits and crossed the plate 
three more times. Hines was Car
negies pitching selection and had the 
Heidelburg batsmen at the tips of his 
fingers all the time. The visitors were 
only able to touch his delivery for 
five hits. Kesner, Hines, Kreider and 
Doherty all hit Pitcher Grabber free
ly. Kesner had two singles and a 
double to his credit. Carnegie was 
playing in tip-top form and had few 
errors to their credit, while the home 
team was rather erratic at times. The 
feature play of the game came when 
Clark surprised the Carnegie-ites and 
stole home in the fourth inning. Ankcney, Neff and Clarke sprung a double 
play in the seventh. Ankeney caught 
Lains fly and threw to Neff, who 
tossed the ball to Clark in time to 
catch Kesner off first. Carnegie drove 
in her first two runs in the first in
ning. Both Kreider and Kesner got 
on base and stole around to second 
and third. Humphreys single brought 
them in. In the fourth inning, Oeffinger got on base and scored on 
Krums single. Heidelburg netted 
two runs in her half of the fourth 
and made things look interesting.

THE 1915 THISTLE.
To Clifford Brown Connelley, 
whose long service and kindly inter
est in all the schools of our institu
tion have greatly molded its progress 
from inception is the dedicatory page 
of the 1915 Thistle. The book is the 
largest and most attractive publica
tion ever issued in Carnegie. It shows 
diligent and incessant work on part 
of those connected with its publica
tion. The editor and his staff are to 
be congratulated.
The plaid binding is a new depart
ure as well as the ingenious arrange
ment of contents and title pages, 
which are brown inserts. It is thor
oughly indexed. The engravings are 
very clear and distinct. The illustra
tions and cartoons are the best that 
any college year book can boast of. 
These features bring our annual pub
lication in the highest rank of col
lege year books. Now let us make 
our 1916 Thistle a still better one.
GERMANYS AMBASSADOR.
Probably no other paper of diplo
matic intent has been so widely dis
cussed in the editorial columns as 
has Germanys memorandum to 
our State Department accusing the 
United States of violating the exact 
spirit of neutrality in permitting the 
exportation of arms to the Allies 
and in not insisting upon the right 
to send food stuffs to Germany. The 
various newspapers of America have 
concluded that the whole tone of the 
note is unusual and its criticism of 
our Government is neither moderate 
nor fair. This assertion of German 
diplomacy may truly be regarded as 
a predetermined attempt to arouse a
public feeling of sentiment against 
the Wilson administration.
This attempt has been singly and 
forcibly aided by Count von Bernstorff who has rendered himself par
ticularly offensive to the President 
and to the people. Count von Bernstorff assumed the unusual liberty to 
make public this communication be
fore our State Department deemed 
wise to do sogiving it the semb
lances of a message to the American 
people other than a matter of acute 
diplomacy.
It is a military rule that any bear
er of a flag of truce forfeits his safe 
conduct if he treats with an army 
save through its commander. Let us 
apply the rule to diplomacy and con
clude that an ambassador who pre
sumes to deal with a nation other
wise than through its government 
lo ses his claim to his position. Count 
von Bernstorff is one of the big men 
who seems to be doing his utmost to 
rock the boat.
G. A. C.
BE AN AMERICAN FIRST 
OF ALL.
By President Wilson.
The Associated Press, whose ob
jective is to furnish to its 900 mem
bers a service of world news that 
shall be untainted and without bias 
of any sort, was chosen by President 
Wislon as the proper audience to 
which he disclosed the first definite 
statement of the neutral policy of the 
administration. The President, rea
lizing the influence of the newspapers 
in moulding public opinion, and the 
importance attached to his statement, 
requested that no attempt be made 
to parargaph his speech or to give 
it publicity until the official White 
House stenographer had transcribed 
it in full.
The speech was delivered April 
20th and because of its length space 
could not be given to it in this issue 
of the Tartan but each reader is ad
vised to look the speech up in one 
of the recent newspapers. It gives 
in a brief and strong way the policy 
which has guided the present cabinet 
officers in balancing the mass of be
wildering European perplexities, and 
its essence is one which should grasp 
the manhood of every American citi
zen.
CAMPUS NOTES.
Work has already commenced on 
the dormitories and the Industries 
Extension, men being engaged in 
foundation work at both places. The 
excavation at the Industries build
ing near the Machinery Hall steps 
is to provide for the garage and work
shops.
There were two birthdays at the 
training house last week, Kelly and 
Cary. Each had a cake with can
dles and received various loving gifts 
from admiring friends.
The coolest and quietest place in 
the Schools is the Carnegie Union. 
There is no better place for quiet 
study, a cool breeze being always 
present to cool the feverish brow of 
the hard working student.
The base ball team, certainly re
deemed itself on the last trip. Every
one out Thursday to see us hang it 
over Penn State.
The Interscholastic meet next Sat
urday should be taken in by every 
student. Remember that we are the 
hosts to the various competing teams 
as well as to that of Allegheny Col
lege.
THOUSANDS VISIT INSTITUTION
Continued from Page 1
On another press the blue plate for 
a three color halftone was being run, 
the red and yellow having been pre
viously run off, and excited much 
curiosity. Mr. Dougherty, in the 
sheet metal shops, had a fine exhibit 
of beaten copper and brass work done 
by the students. In the carpenter 
shop, there was a large exhibition of 
hand made furniture of all sorts and 
excellent pieces of workmanship. The 
other shops featured the more difficult 
work of the year and had fine dis
plays.
All departments were in full blast 
in the Science Building. Prof. Hower 
had a large exhibit illustrating effi
cient house, store, and shop lighting. 
In the Metallurgiral laboratory a heat 
of steel was run in one of the electric 
furnaces and all the pigs, washing 
tables and other machinery were in 
operation in the mining laboratory. 
Upstairs day students filled the chem
ical laboratory, making such oderiferous smells that visitors rarely got 
beyond the door. In the physics 
laboratory the Plebes were in their 
element, running difficult and delicate 
experiments to the awe of the femi
nine visitors. Professor Mott had so 
much water on the floor in the hydraulic laboratory that the room re
sembled a duck pond.
A charette was on in the Design 
building and was enlivened by a 
Salvation Army parade with a few 
other features not on the program. 
Downstairs in the foyer two police
men stood guard over several sacks 
of Uncle Andys $2,700,000, just do
nated. The music department was 
having orchestra practice and a large 
display of beaux arts and other draw
ings was on the walls of the exhibi
tion room.
The M. M. C. S. school presented 
the best front from the masculine 
point of view. Here dainty maids 
fried home made doughnuts for the 
visitors delectation, wove baskets, 
and made pottery. The little house 
was in perfect order and looked too 
homelike and attractive to be left 
in a hurry. Not the least attraction 
were the hostesses themselves.
In the Carnegie Union, the Pan 
Hellenic Club of the M. M. C. S. held 
one of their well appointed dances, 
and the club room could not have 
been shown off to a better advantage. 
Visitors did not fail to express their 
admiration for the style of decoration 
and of furnishings, not forgetting 
various compliments for the feminine 
occupants of the room.
Montana State College has a rather 
unique way of advertising among the 
high schools of the state. It has in
augurated a custom of holding an 
interscholastic carnival each year at 
which teams from the various high 
schools of the state compete to take 
home honors for being the best in 
basketball and extemporaneous speak
ing.

THE PRESS MEET.
Plaid Athletes Capture Three First 
Places.
The annual spring outdoor meet 
of The Pittsburgh Press, held at 
Schenley Oval on Saturday turned 
out to be the most successful ever 
given by that paper. The races were 
all lively and close enough to keep 
the spectators constantly thrilled. All 
told there were seven open handi
cap events, and in these Tech won 
three firsts and finally totalled a 
score of fifteen points. Indiana Nor
mal came second with twelve points 
and the P. A.'A. had finished third.
In the trial heats of the 100-yd 
dash Hemman and Walsh both cap
tured first places. It looked like Car
negie had a good chance to place in 
the finals but Hemman was just nosed 
out by Carrol of Indiana who crossed 
the tape third. The Normal school 
star could not pass his team mates, 
Fletcher and Holland who finished 
first and second respectively.
The 220-yd. handicap was another 
close race. Hemman again proved 
his metal and after crossing the tape 
first in his trial heat, succeeded in 
winning the finals. Schumacker, a 
Carnegie man, but entered unattach
ed, took second place.
Hal Wright won another first for 
Tech, when he cleared the bar 
at ten feet nine inches in the pole 
vault, from scratch, and out distanced 
his handicapped opponents.
One of the best events of the af
ternoon was the one mile relay race 
between Carnegie Tech, Indiana Nor
mal and P. A. A. Here again Tech 
was victorious. Heyl, Dunseith, 
Hemman and Riser made up the win
ning team. The touch offs were all 
close and the race from start to fin
ish was a hot one. Rieser of Tech, 
Carroll of Indiana and Cross of P. 
A. A. represented their schools in the 
final quarter, Reiser winning by sev
eral yards, Indiana Normal second 
and P. A. A. third. Besides the A.
A. U. events there were many events 
for High Schools and for smaller 
boys.

The track team, under the able 
guidance of Coach Dull, has been 
practising hard and making every ef
fort in order to make a good show
ing in the coming meets which have 
been scheduled.
One of the propositions brought 
before the management and dis
cussed considerably, was the possi
bility of arranging a dual meet with 
the University of Michigan for the 
past Saturday. However, it was 
found impossible to make the final 
arrangements. A meet with this 
school would have been welcomed by 
Tech and we hope to see the day very 
soon when Tech will successfully 
compete with schools of this calibre. 
The interest in athletics is just grow
ing and with the material at hand and 
the rapid improvement of our staff 
of coaches there is no reason why we 
should not have the highest hopes for 
the future.
At a recent convention of the Fed
eration of Womens Clubs in Warren, 
Pa., the women of the state agreed 
to give four scholarships to as many 
young women of the state, to Penn
sylvania State College for next year. 
The only requirement made is that 
the young ladies shall take the course 
of instruction in the school of Home 
Economics.
INTERSCHOOL BASEBALL.
Many members of the various 
classes of the Science, Design and In
dustry schools have been practising 
and developing teams to represent 
their classes.
At present no definite schedule has 
been made out, however, the games 
will be scheduled by Director McCulloch, in the most appropriate way 
suitable to the classes. The Science 
and Industry schools will be repre
sented by three teams each, Plebe, 
Sophomore, and a team composed of 
Juniors and Seniors. The Design 
school will enter two teams, a Plebe 
team and another, composed of the 
remaining classes.
Already much promising material 
has been brought and some good 
games should be witnessed. The De
sign school boasts of some major 
league material. The Science men 
recently developed a no hit pitcher 
in their Junior class, and no doubt 
the Industry school will be present 
with their usual strong representa
tion.
When each school has decided 
upon their best representative team, 
a championship series will be held to 
determine to which department the 
highest honors belong.
TENNIS CLUB DANCE.
On Wednesday evening, April 28th, 
a very enjoyable entertainment was 
given by the Tennis club. About 75 
couples spent a most pleasant even
ing dancing from 8:30 till 1 oclock. 
The music was furnished by Nirella, 
and not a small portion of the suc
cess of the evening was due to the 
efforts of this trio of musicians. The 
dance was held in order to partially 
defray the expenses of the Varsity 
tennis team. The proceeds being 
added to the appropriation granted 
by the Athletic Association for this 
branch of athletics. Every good 
school boasts of a tennis team, and 
we hope to see the efforts of this 
branch of athletics meet with the 
best of success.
INTERCOLLEGIATE NEWS.
An Equal Rights Association was 
organized by some of the co-eds at 
the University of Kentucky.
There will be no Oxford-Cambridge boat race this year. The offi
cial announcement came as no sur
prise, since the members of the crews 
have enlisted in the British army. 
The boat race between Oxford and 
Cambridge has been an annual affair 
for the past 86 years. In 1855 the 
contest was cancelled on account of 
the Crimean war. This year will, 
consequently mark the second can
cellation of the races since their in
auguration.Ex.
S. P. Walkingstick, a Dartmouth 
Freshman, and a full-blooded Cehrokee Indiana, has added a new Indian 
yell to Dartmouths repertoire. The 
yell which is of true Cherokee origin
Pennsylvania is getting estimates 
on a stadium which will cost approxi
mately $500,000 and will seat 75,000 
persons.

Second Game With Pitt.
M. M. C. S. Varsity was defeated 
the second time this season by Pitt. 
The game was held Thursday, April 
29, in Trees Gymnasium. Although 
the score would indicate that we re
ceived a pretty bad beating, the game 
was not at all one-sided, and the Pitt 
girls did not have a walk-over by any 
means.
The game was called at 4:30 p. m. 
The gym at Pitt is about four times 
the size of our gymnasium, and our 
team was wholly unaccustomed to 
the large floor space. The time was 
divided into four quarters of eight 
minutes each. The score at the end 
of the first quarter was 6-3, Pitt; the 
second quarter 15-5, Pitt; the third 
quarter 18-11, Pitt; and the final 
score 24-13, Pitt.
Our girls played with their usual 
good spirit, and the team was com
plimented by the Pitt coach upon its 
clean playing.
Not enough praise can be given to 
the girls on our school team who, 
despite the long afternoon classes 
and heavy curriculum, have managed 
to keep up the basket ball team and 
have made the Athletic Association 
the liveliest activity in the school.
Brickley, of Harvard, has been of
fered $2,500 a season to coach the 
Ames (Iowa) college football squad.
THE PLAYS THE THING.
Under this caption, it is the inten
tion to review, in these columns, the 
years work of the Department of 
Dramatic Art, from the viewpoint of 
the onlookerit having seemed best 
to allow the fruit to mellow before 
finding fault with its flavor.
In the first offering of this depart
ment a year ago, April 23rd, (The 
Two Gentlemen of Verona) it will 
be recalled that several members of 
the cast foreshadowed more promise 
than others; the purpose is to fol
low these through their repertoire 
for in reality, this department is a 
stock company where one may study 
developing temperaments of various 
types.As Dogberry says, Compari
sons are odious, but judgment rests 
largely on comparison and one star 
differeth from another star in glory 
if you desire, scriptural authority, 
but to the matter in hand. The 
range of dramatic literature has been 
exceptionally well covered from the 
Greek. Classics (Euripidis Iphigenia in Tauris) to the modern of 
the moderns, as represented best per
haps, by the tragic episode, The Be
trayal by Padric Collum, and given 
under his personal direction. The 
Irish Dramatists have shared evenly, 
with the classics, ranking the two 
Shakespeare plays with Greek drama, 
while local talent in The Chaplet of 
Panhas not been overlooked.
Mr. J. Woodman Thompson is one 
of the men who has contributed very 
largely to the success of these pro
ductions through the medium of his 
brush, giving appropriate scenery,
conceived and executed with the in
tuition and care of an artistavoid
ing crude color combinations and the 
general scrambled egg effects found 
in much scene painting. In short, 
he has done all the scene painter can 
do to make these productions artistic. 
Mr. Thompson has earned the grati
tude and admiration of his public.
The costuming has been generally 
appropriate and pleasing while the 
lighting effects deserve mention. The 
atmosphere of certain scenes would 
have been wholly lost without a 
proper handling of the lights. The 
scene-shifting has shown less im
provement than any other feature of 
the work, where any actual change 
of stage-setting occursdue perhaps 
to cramped quarters. It will be un
derstood that First Nights are not 
under considerationthe privilege of 
attendance not being accorded to the 
student body.
NOTED LECTURER SPEAKS.
In the person of John W. Slayton, the
C. I. T. Economic Society was very 
fortunate in getting a man who is 
perhaps more capable of explaining 
what Socialism stands for, than any 
other. Mr. Slayton spoke to a 
small but enthusiastic gathering in 
the Design School Theatre, Friday 
afternoon, April 30. The endeavor 
of the speaker was to show what So
cialism is striving to do and how 
its advocates are attempting to do it. 
From the ovation tendered, Mr. Slay
ton at the close of the talk it was 
plain to be seen that most of the 
audience were heartily in favor of 
his arguments.
Mr. Slayton did not advocate vio
lent means or, in fact, any of the 
methods so often attributed to the 
Socialist movement. On the con
trary, his views surprised everyone, 
and almost all the audience were 
agreed that the Society was indeed 
favored in the chance of hearing Mr. 
Slayton.

OTTERBEIN VICTORIOUS.
Plaid Nine Loses Pitchers Duel, 
2 to 0.
The first of a series of three games 
played on a three-day trip last week, 
resulted in a defeat of 2 to 0. The 
game was played with Otterbein Uni
versity on April 29th. Both pitchers 
twirled air-tight games and both al
lowed only three scattered hits and 
none of these were for more than one 
sack. Wean did the good work on 
the mound for Carnegie, while Camp
bell did the pitching for the oppon
ents.
Costly errors were the chief cause 
of Techs downfall. Although only 
a few were made by the Plaid partici
pants, these came at the crucial mo
ments of the game and with bad re
sults. Nevertheless, the errors by the 
visitors were few in number. Otter
bein played an excellent game and 
backed up Pitcher Campbell in ex
cellent style. With so little hitting.
howeve,r the game was not of great 
interest.
Otterbein scored their two runs . 
early in the encounter. The first man 
up, Wireman, reached first on an 
error by Krum and, aided by P. Car
vers single, worked his way around 
the bases for a tally. In the third, J. 
Garver walked and scored when Do
herty muffed P. Garvers grounder.

OHIO NORTHERN LOSES.
Carnegie Plays Fine GameLain 
Stars at Bat.
After losing to Otterbein on Thurs
day the Plaid nine came up against 
Ohio Northern and played better ball 
than they have displayed at any time 
earlier in the season, winning 6 to 1. 
The opponents were absolutely fooled 
by Darlingtons masterly twirling 
and obtained three well scattered hits. 
Darlington seemed to be in the best 
of form and had control of those 
who faced him from the first inning 
on.
But Catcher Lain must also be given 
his share of the praise. The first 
three times at bat he succeeded in 
smashing out three hits. The first, 
a two-bagger, went over the fence. 
The second was a long single. His 
last hit was a terrific home run wal
lop over the fence again. Kesner, too. 
was busy in the batting line. He 
clouted out two three-baggers.
Mills, who pitched for Ohio North
ern, in spite of being freely pounded 
by the Tech batsmen, was credited 
with thirteen strike-outs. Perhaps 
this unlucky number was the cause of 
his downfall.
In the opening inning, with one 
down, McClure walked and Kesner 
was struck by a pitched ball. Lain 
smashed out a double over the fence
P. LUDEBUEHL and SON
Shoes and Hosiery
and drove in two runs. No more 
scoring was done until the third in
ning. Kesner, the first man up, 
tripled and scored on a single by 
Lain. , In the fifth, Lain delivered the 
longest hit of the game, when he 
smashed out his home run drive, once 
more over the fence. In the sixth, 
Ohio brought in her only tally, when 
Rudolph walked, moved up on Dar
lingtons error and scored on an in
field hit by Slater. Tech added on 
her last two runs in the ninth. Both 
Doherty and Kreider hit safely and 
got on base. Kesners second threebase drive scored both men, making 
the totals 6 to 1. The box score:

DESIGN SCHOOL NOTES
DESIGN SCHOOL.
Probably no other problem of the 
year has been more eagerly carried 
into effect than the one completed 
May 1st by the Class A men. It 
was an elevation, plain and section 
for a monumental memorial and will 
be judged by the Beaux Art Society 
in New York upon May 5.
SPECIAL NOTE.
C. C. Wood, of the Plebe Archi
tectural Class in the Design School, 
has been busy directing his father 
about the school. Mr. Wood, Sr., 
spent some time here and being an 
architect, expressed a supreme satis
faction in the Institutes work.
EIGHT STUDENTS RECEIVE 
ARTS AWARDS.
In the recent contest of the So
ciety Beaux Arts, in which students 
of all the leading architectural schools 
of the nation competed, eight stu
dents of architecture in the School of 
Applied Design received awards. 
They are: E. B. Pearce, of Steuben
ville, O.; Lillian Griffin, of Pittsburgh; 
Percy Meyn, of Jeannette; and C. J. 
Lapley, of Harrisburg were awarded 
medals and H. C. Messerschmidt, of 
Richmond, Va.; W. R. Weigler, of 
Pittsburgh; O. J. Southwell, of Beau
mont, Tex.; and J. G. Gay, of Hamil
ton, Ont., received honorable men
tion.
FINAL LECTURE ON WIRELESS 
GIVEN.
On Tuesday, April 27, Mr. Van 
Dyck delivered the sixth and last of 
the lectures on Radio work. This last 
lecture was mainly devoted to an
swering questions that had come upin previous talks.
Many of the questions were very 
well put and showed that some deep 
thinking had been done by the ques
tioners. The uses of the wave meter 
were fullv described, and its construc
tion also touched upon.
Besides the questions, Mr. Van 
Dyck spoke a little about Radio Tele
phony, and said there was no reason 
why the fellows should not construct 
wireless telephone stations, as they 
are much simpler than the ordinary 
wireless. The precautions necessary 
with the arc telephone were described 
and the ways of getting good re
sults explained.
Different phases of commercial op
erating and the requirements for 
radio operators were discussed and 
some features of the operators life 
told.
In closing, Mr. Van Dyck urged 
every wireless fan to become a 
member of the Radio Society and 
thus derive many benefits they other
wise could not obtain.
A recent faculty ruling has decided 
that Princeton will not have military 
drill.

TO THE NEW SCHOOLS.
Why do ye struggle so at patchwork 
things,
Ye furious moderns, with your halfmad eyes?
Why do ye beat your vain, untutored
wings
Against the potals of Gods or
dered skies?
To dream were better; to believe, 
more wise.
Lost is the line that was the grace of 
Greece,
The true proportions of her tem
ples lost!
And with them what immortal rooms 
of peace?
What art wide-scattered, and at 
what high cost
To such a universe by such minds 
tossed!
Shall we restore the curve of Helens 
cheek?
Rebuild those temples, part by per
fect part,
Unless divining where our hands are 
weak,
We bid emotion still inspire our 
art,
Deny the frenzied brain, obey the 
heart?
Oh, say not ever that Gods beauty 
turns
Upon discoveries that madwits find,
The lamp is lighted when the spirit 
burns,
The souls eye sees when Thought 
and Will are blind
Whoever found a heaven with his 
mind?

At the meeting of the Mho Club 
on Wednesday evening, April 28, in 
Room 104, M. H., the members pres
ent voted that the Mho Club instruct 
Professor Dennison to take what 
steps are necessary in order that the 
organization may become a student 
branch of the American Institute of 
Electrical Engineers. Although the 
attendance was not large, the pur
pose of the meeting had been well 
advertised, so that the action w*as 
taken regardless.
The name of the club will remain 
as it is; but it will become a part 
of the national body to which month
ly reports must be made. The step 
involves no financial responsibility 
except to those who become student 
members of the Institute, which is 
not compulsory in order to be a mem
ber of the student branch. The dues 
of student members to the Institute 
are three dollars a year.
The advantage accruing from this 
step are especially great in this local
ity, which is fortunate in having the 
president of the A. I. E. E. living in 
it, besides hundreds of practicing en
gineer members. The members of 
the Mho Club will, as Professor Den
nison expressed it, become younger 
brothers of the big men in the pro
fession, so that in this way it will 
give them leverage when they start 
out for themselves.
The banquet of the club is expected 
to come off in the near future, prob
ably in the second week of May. An 
especial attempt to secure the pres
ence of all the members and inter
ested persons, mainly Plebes electing 
electrical, is being made by the com
mittee in charge, which was increased 
by the appointment of D. L. Trautman, the energetic vice president of 
the club.
The speakers of the evening were 
Don Gleason and R. I. Salsbury. The 
former, a senior, spoke of electrical 
relays of all kinds with an ease which 
showed preparation; but with a use 
of impedances and polyphase circuits 
a trifle bewildering to the sophomores. 
The second speakers subject was the 
Keokuk Dam Power Plant and this 
340,000 H. P. installation on the Miss
issippi was treated in an interesting 
and popular way.
the world renowned wizard of Sche
nectady, H. M. Hobart, the greatest 
English speaking designer of Elec
trical Machinery, Paddy Ryan, who 
invented high tension, together with 
all the past and future presidents of 
the Electrical Institutes of the world 
are thronging the steamship docks 
and crowding the railway trains on 
their way to attend the great gor
geous gastronomic get-together or
ganization dinner of the consolidated 
Mho Club-A. I. E. E. Branch, which 
is to rend things Electrical .at Tech 
on the 21st of May, 1915. Dont fail 
to qualify. Get up early and see the 
circus come to town. Get in line 
early for your tickets. Watch for the 
free attractions to be announced later.

Geneva Wins in Doubles.
Before a large enthusiastic gath
ering of tennis devotees, Geneva Col
lege defeated Carnegie Techs repre
sentatives on the Tech courts yester
day four matches to two. The teams 
split even in singles, Davis and Steen 
winning for Tech and Dodds and 
Johnson for the Beaver county aggre
gation.
Geneva won in the double sets, an
nexing both matches, Dodds and 
Smith beating Davis and Steen, while 
Johnson and Buchannon defeated 
Bihlman and English in straight sets.
The tryouts had been held on Sat
urday, and H. L. Seymour of the P. 
A. A. picked the team to represent 
Tech, R. S. Wilson being the alter
nate.
The match was interesting through
out and all the games were well con
tested. Some pretty play was brought 
out in the single matches, Davis star
ring for Tech and Dodds being Ge
nevas best performer. Davis played 
a brilliant and spectacular game, plac
ing his shots well, besides using a 
backhand loft to advantage. Unfor
tunately these two stars were not 
pitted against each other, a rattling 
game would no doubt have resulted 
had they played.
Davis almost pulled the double 
match out of the fire by his clever 
individual play.
The match was played on a wet 
court, due to the rain that was fall
ing immediately preceding the play
ing time, the summaries:
Davis of Tech defeated Smith of 
Geneva in straight sets, 6-0 and 6-1.
Dodds of Geneva defeated Bihl
man of Tech, 7-5 and 6-1.
Steen of Tech beat Buchannon of 
Geneva, 6-0 and 6-1.
Johnson of Geneva defeated Eng
lish of Tech, 7-9, 6-3 and 7-5.

Steen 6-4, 2-6 and 6-3.

The value of clean outer apparel is 
of great importance. We know from 
hearing comments expressed by all 
classes of people that ones outer 
appareance is most essential, for 
many times the selection of a man 
or woman for a better position in life 
depends, in part at least, upon his 
or her personality (clean and well 
pressed clothes). See Shuman, 3911

Fifth Annual Meet and Allegheny 
Dual Meet Next Saturday.
The Fifth of the Annual Inteirscholastic Track Meets held each year 
by this Institution will take place on 
Schenley Oval next Saturday. Al
ready sixteen high and prep schools 
in this part of the country, have en
tered and it is now certain that the 
meet this year will be larger and bet
ter than any of the four preceding. 
Last year Grecnsburg H. S. won from 
McKeesport by a small margin.
Entries have been received from 
the following Schools: Greensburg
High, McKeesport High, Johnstown 
High, Kiski, Central High, Fifth Ave. 
High, Peabody High, South High, 
Shadyside Academy, Sewickley High, 
Wilkinsburg High, New Castle High, 
Monongahela High, Brushton High, 
Monesson High, and Shaw High 
School of Cleveland.
The meet is scheduled to begin at 
1 oclock sharp.
The medals to be awarded and the 
cups, have been placed on display in 
Spalding's window, downtown.
The same time as the Interscholas
tic, Carnegie will fight out a Dual 
Meet with Allegheny College. Our 
rivals from up the state excell in 
every form of athletics and if their 
track team is of the same calibre as 
their base-ball and foot-ball teams, 
the meet will be exceedingly inter
esting. Carnegie will enter her men 
as follows:
100-yard dash  Hemman, Heyl, 
Schumaker and Blumenthal.
220-yard dash  Hemman, Heyl,

Allegheny has not been heard from 
recently and her entries are as yet 
unknown.
Coach Dull requests that more 
men come out for the weights. Pitt 
is particularly strong in this line and 
if we want to stand any show in the 
Pitt Dual we must have more ma
terial. There are men in school who 
have plenty of ability and need only 
a little practice to develop into ex
cellent weight men. It is hoped that 
more will report immediately.

The faculty of the University of 
Colorado has recently passed a rul
ing whereby the staff of the college 
paper will be subject to the same eli
gibility rules as govern the varsity 
athletic teams, that is, a passing grade 
in two-thirds of their course.
During the current school year six 
Kansas colleges have adopted the 
system of simplified spelling. There 
are now 67 schools in all with this 
plan in use; and resolutions have been 
passed asking publishers to adopt the 
system.
