Is it McKendree Springcoil

McKendre Springa new season 
in a new year ot music? or 
maybe even McKendree Spring 
a glistening strip ot water? It 
may be these, and more, that 
makes them a refreshing change 
in this day of crashing cym
bals and screaming guitars. They 
are the new season of musician 
who touches all of your senses 
and makes you instantly comfor
table with and receptive to their 
style.
McKendree Spring as a grt)up 
are like a Renaissance man. com
prised of lour distinctive beings 
who have blended together to 
form a new idea in popular mu
sic. As the group s singer. Fran 
McKendree delivers a clean sound 
that can grow to the jolting cli
max of "Traitor Spock. she 
screams. . . . or the soit sweet 
pleas of "What Will We Do With 
the Child?" Yet. still he retains 
the folk flavor that has become 
his via the campus Coftee

ly related to his feeling for his

If Fran may be called the folk 
influence of the group.% Marty 
Slutsky is certainly the city man. 
His lead guitar gets into driving

contains some beautiful counter 
melodies. The other members of 
the group say he "plays it cool,

living like a heavy rock." Marty 
adds the fuzz boxrock angle to 
the group: and yet. even with 
these elements of the now-fading 
acid-rock, their sound remains 
mellow, and above all, clean. 
Larry Tucker, the bass player, 
is a warm, poetic kind of guy 
whose roots, like Marty's, are 
in hard rock. With Marty, he 
provides a solid foundation tor 
Fran's flowing vocals, and oc
casionally. a clear jump into a

who meets the most people on

Mark Ruffner. President of Men s Dormitory Council, and Mark 
^eltman. Rush Chairman of Delta Upsilon, have decided to com
bine forces and run as co-presidents of Student Senate.
According to a release announcing their candidacy, "this prece
dent was set last year when Michael Armentrout withdrew in favor 
ot Joe Duckworth. We are carrying the precedent one step further 
not just combining voting blocks, but by also combining ideas. 
resurces. and qualities into a compatible team.
A team unifying dormitory and fraternity interests will create 
the opportunity for needed innovation in the administration and 
^presentation of Student Senate." thev continued.
By PAMELA HORNER
Mr. James Givner. President of Forever Action 
Together, spoke about the law enforcement needs 
of the black community at the Thursday Noon For
um.
 Forever Action Together (FAT is a broad 
base "umbrella organization in the HomewoodBrushton community^ It attempts to co-ordinate the 
efforts of the 70-odd community organizations of 
Homewood-Brushton so no duplication of efforts 
occurs in the community's structure. The organiza
tions all maintain their autonomy.
. . . .Mr. Givner believes that a crisis exists in the 
relationship between police and the community. 
While a community is responsible for some of its 
problems, it is the job of the police to give protec
tion to the community by controlling crime. The 
community is unable to do this alone.
Part of the problem, as Mr. Givner sees it. is 
that "the training of officers is somewhat out-dated for the task they must perform." "Every police
man should be able to handle the problems that 
arise, instead of calling for "someone else who 
has no idea of the background of the situation."
Too often in a community, "police represent 
not protection but harrasment. I contend that they 
go in and create problems that did not exist be
fore they came." he stated.
As an example. Mr. Givner cited a recent 
occurrence in the Homewood-Brushton community. 
Alarmed at the rise in crime in the community, a 
committee was sent to City Hall to ask for more 
aid in combating the problem. In response, the 70- 
man Tactical Squad of the Pittsburgh police force 
was sent to patrol the area. For 3 days, between 
noon and 4 o'clock, the Tactical Squad patrolled 
the 5 block area of a business district. Because this 
did nothing to stop crime and several confronta
tions occurred between young people and the 
squad, the people of Homewood-Brushton request
ed that the force be removed.
Mr. Givner questioned the value of the Tac
tical Squad because they "did nothing to alleviate 
conditions. He saw no purpose in patrolling only a 
5 block area, when a 6 to 7 square mile area need
ed protection. "What we got was a show of force 
and strength, not what we asked for." he stated.
 Mr. Givner sees many problems in HomewoodBrushton. but believes that they are similar to 
problems in all communities. "These problems are 
only treated differently in different areas." He also 
faulted the citizens in a community for consider
ing a problem serious only when it affects their 
family.
"We feel, in the black community, that there 
is a need for a better relationship between the po
lice department and the community." The police
men do not know the people and the people do not 
respect the police. "We are spending tax money 
without any result." he added.
Homewood-Brushton tried a Law Enforcement 
Committee where citizens patrolled their com
munity and tried to report what they learned to the 
police. "But you have no authority and you've 
got to do everything for them (the police." ex
plained Mr. Givner.
He further stated his belief that better protec
tion is a problem "that I don t think can be solved 
by the black community. This is a political city 
where the right person shaking the right hand is 
what gets things done." Mr. Givner made it clear 
that a black man cannot shake the right hands. His 
job in the city's government is at stake If he asks 
for the wrong thing at the wrong time, if he does 
not state the opinion desired by City Hall, he can 
be replaced.
Mr. Givner ended by calling for togetherness 
among communities "to effect some type of change 
in this city's structure." He believes that the com
munities can maintain their separateness, but they 
must unite to solve common problems. "We togeth
er should holler loud. We can t do it alone."

LETTERS TO THE EDITOREditorial
As a senior already beginning to reminisce about her 
four years of college, feeling nostalgic in one sense and ec
static about leaving in another, I am concerned about the 
direction in which our University is moving. One area of my 
distress, as I look back, is what is going on in the classroom, 
not only here but at every major college and university in 
this country.
The past decade has witnessed a student revolt against 
traditional university structures and a questioning of wheth
er what it is what has to be. The question of tenure and pro
motion and the structure which exists to grant these rewards 
is one which deserves primary attention.
The structure as it now exists at C-MU is three tiered. 
A decision is first made at the departmental level by tenur
ed faculty. A judgment, either positive, negative or split, is 
then communicated to a college committee, the members of 
which are appointed by the Dean and department chairmen. 
These faculty often remain anonymous to the junior faculty 
and to students. The Committee meets in closed session and 
dissolves once it completes its deliberations. The College 
Committees decision is then sent to the University Com
mittee on Promotion and Tenure, chaired by Dr. Schatz, 
Vice-President for Academic Affairs. On cases of renewal 
of contract and promotion below the tenured level, the Com
mittee generally acts as a rubber stamp approving the Col
lege Committees decision. On questions of tenure, the 
Committee rightly spends a large amount of time as their 
decision will affect generations of students to come.
This is the present structure. The question to be asked 
is whether or not it is the best one. We do not think it is.
Philosophically the structure must be changed to admit, 
in an important position, criteria which, at present, have 
no defined place in the system. Although doctorate degrees 
and publications may be somewhat necessary for the prestige 
of the University, they have little or no importance in a stu
dents judgment of teaching ability. Although the correlation 
between good teaching and good researching may exist in 
CIT, we do not find the same interrelation can be made for 
the Department of Humanities. Good teachers there are rare
ly the most voluninous writers. Therefore we recommend, in 
the Humanities Department especially, that a set of criteria 
be established which provides for a heavier emphasis on 
teaching ability rather than on publications and degrees.
That brings us to a second point. Who should make the 
judgment of teaching ability? Certainly tenured faculty 
should have an important say as they do not fear a loss of 
position and may objectively make a decision on a mans 
usefulness and ability. At the same time, their perceptions 
of what students are, and what college is, may be founded 
on past experiences which, in many respects, do not relate 
to the situation today. A good teacher who uses different, 
not necessarily better, teaching methods and holds untraditional beliefs may be regarded as a poor teacher against old 
criteria.
We must create a process in which younger faculty and 
students have a defined role in the system. Junior faculty 
should be allowed to participate in the decision, and student 
input through teacher evaluation forms, the number of stu
dents who elect a class, and outside the classroom comments 
should be admitted as evidence.
There is another aspect of the decisional process which 
disturbs us, namely that of the secrecy of the deliberation. 
We think it is imperative for all the members of the college 
to be aware of the composition of the committee. Represen
tatives must be held responsible, and must be made to feel 
responsible, to the community for which they act. In addi
tion, we think that the members of the College Committees 
should be elected by the entire faculty of each departmentment. In that way, the members chosen would reflect the 
wishes of the majority of the faculty and, hopefully, of the 
students. Finally, the College Committees should not be 
dissolved when deliberations are over. It should remain to 
act as a place for those who are unsatisfied by a particular de
cision to go for answers to their questions.
The decision of who is to be on the faculty is probably 
the most important a University ever makes. For without 
good teachers, a good University is impossible.
The Hastie decision, the refusal to renew a contract 
against the wishes of many students and faculty, is concrete 
evidence that the system needs to be changed and revised 
now. If we continue along these lines, if this case sets anv 
kind of precedent, the Universitys faculty will become, by in 
large, a homogenuous group of men, unstimulating and, for the 
most part, irrelevent.
If this is the case, if we refuse to move and change the 
system, than an important part of my nostalgia will be eras
ed ..............and a feeling of sorrow for future students will
replace it.
E.B.
Desire for A Voice in Decisions at H&SS
Editor. The Tartan:
A number of us are deeply 
concerned that the H & SS Pro
motions Committee has refused 
to accept the English Depart
ment recommendation that Jim 
Hastie s contract be renewed 
for next year. So that there may 
be no misunderstanding of the 
context within which I speak. 
I must say first that in my judg
ment all decisions on salary, 
renewal of contract, promotion, 
and tenure should be made pri
marily at the department level, 
where a man's character, work, 
and teaching effectiveness are 
best known; and that in these 
councils the untenured staff and 
the students should have a de
fined and significant voice, al
though a minority one. Both 
justice and expediency require 
that these reforms be made soon. 
The traditional exclusiveness and 
secrecy of such deliberations at 
C-MU have no place in a mod
ern university. They are ruinous 
to the morale of untenured staff 
and students alike, they encour
age time wasting paranoia, poli
tics, and factionalism, and they 
represent exactly that model of 
the closed society that the offic
ial rhetoric of the university has 
always opposed.
Some of us who support decen
tralizing and democratizing the 
university structure and decision 
making also believe that we 
should be asking some new 
questions about the teaching 
staff. We see very clearly that 
the old, presumably universal 
criteria for what constitutes ex
cellence in the academy have 
often led in practice to the re
tention of the sycophantic and 
the unfree; the operation of the 
system might almost lead one to
suppose that if had been design
ed to cripple. in order to pro
mote. Moreover, even where 
these criteria have been applied 
most systematically and effec
tively. they have not prevented 
(it is often charged that they 
produced > the crises at Berkeley. 
Columbia. Harvard, and a half 
dozen other of our most presti
gious universities. Why should 
we emulate them, or these? 
When we established the new 
College of Humanities'and So
cial Sciences, we re-dedicated 
ourselves to the long standing 
piosities that good teaching and 
bold experimentation and inno
vation mattered, and that they 
would be rewarded. But when 
the critical moment comes, CMU seems capable of asking only 
the same old questions about its 
teaching staff:
1. Does the man have his Ph.
D.?
2. How much has he publish
ed?
3. Do his life style and his 
views on professional and 
social questions accord with 
those of his tenured col
leagues?
Or. in other words, is he safe?
Questions 1 and 2 are certain
ly legitimate ones, and number 
3 will always be with us under 
one pretext or another. But no 
university that hopes to be relevent today can afford to ask 
only questions that invite easily 
quantifiable responses. Wecer
tainly we in the Humanities, 
ought to supplement these ques
tions with an entirely different 
order of questions to which we 
give equal or greater weight, 
questions that involve the con
cept of the university as a mod
el of a humane society that 
might come to be. a truly liberal 
and pluralistic intellectual com
munity that values a spectrum 
of personality and commitment, 
not the dull sameness of a lunar 
landscape:
1. Is the man a free and com
mitted person?
2. Does he perform an impor
tant function? A unique fun
ction?
3. How well does he perform 
it? What impact does he 
have upon those with whom 
he is most vitally in con
tacthis students, his peers? 
That part of the community 
that he has chosen to serve?
Even by the conventional cri
teria that with each passing day 
seems more arbitrary and irrelevent, Jim Hastie does not do 
badly. He is near having his 
doctorate with good prospects of 
publishing his dissertation. By 
the second set of criteria, he 
does extremely well. Surely, if 
anyone is free and committed, 
Jim Hastie is. His students and 
peers want him retained. His rat
ing as a teacher according to 
standards established by the 
Department  partly at the be
hest of the College  is super
ior. He clearly performs an im
portant and unique function in 
the University, and in the Uni
versity's relationship to the larg
er community. He cannot be re
placed; he can only be lost.

Student Employee Defends Food Service
Editor. The Tartan:
I have been working for Food 
Service since September 1969. I 
was as shocked as everyone at 
the food poisoning. I asked ques
tions. kept my eyes and ears 
open and. like everyone else, 
tried to discern as many facts'' 
as possible during the three days 
of the epidemic. I was equally 
shocked by the opinionated let
ter presented in the Tartan as 
an article of fact written by 
Messrs. Sabor and Weltin. Their 
tirade seemed to me to be an 
obvious piece of propaganda aim
ed at trying to polarize the 
workers against the establish
ment.'' to further the aim of the 
radical SDS and had little im
petus on actually, specifically 
correcting the problems.
As long as I have worked in 
Skibo I have been aware of the 
enormous effort made to keep 
every part of the operation as 
clean and sanitary as possible. 
Now I realize, as I would think 
anyone who took the time to 
think about it would, that with 
such a large operation and with 
as many part-time employees 
as there are. things are not al
ways as they should be. But a 
consistent effort has always been 
made. How many times have you 
eaten at Skibo and forgotten to 
wash your hands before eating? 
Just one slip and you are put 
in the same position as the kit
chen help when one part-time 
employee leaves and another ar
rives and something might be 
forgotten in the interim. This is 
rare but it does heppen to all of 
us. I think enormous praise is 
due that so few problems arise 
in an operation running 13 hours 
a day, seven days a week, with 
no break. Consideration and
praise, rather than slanderous, 
naive, and thoughtless remarks.
I was laid off along with my 
fellow workers, but I never saw 
or talked with anyone who was 
"so incensed that the univer
sity boss administration' thought 
it necessary to pacify them." 
We were all upset, but again 
Messrs. Sabor and Weltin are 
using the tactics of propaganda 
to merely stir emotions and cre
ate trouble. The University tried 
to help compensate for the lay
off by advancing summer pay. 
I saw this effort on the part of 
the University to help the work
ers during this crisis as being 
particularly admirable consider
ing that money is scarce and 
that the University is having fin
ancial problems. Granted the 
University could and still might 
do more, but the point is that a 
consistent effort is being made to 
solve the problems. The workers 
saw this and there was no new 
wave of resentment."
I am personally responsible 
for keeping the storeroom clean 
on weekends. I challenge Messrs. 
Sabor and Weltin or anyone else 
to show me how the storeroom 
might be cleaner or more or
derly. We are not inadequately 
staffed here or in the kitchen. 
The kitchen staff works with 
more efficiency and care to in
sure that everything is prepared 
well. But. perhaps one should 
consider that in preparing large 
quantities of food there are 
bound to be problems. The 
point again is that the quality 
is consistent. It might not taste 
like your mother's favorite re
cipe. but if your mother cooked 
for as many people as Skibo 
does, dav in and dav out. her
meals would probably lack 
much much more.
I think, finally, that we all 
have to realize that to remedy 
any problems, you have to keep 
cool and objectively look at the 
facts rather than listening to 
unfounded rumors and slander
ous, emotion filled accusations, 
which only seem to prove that 
some people enrolled in this 
university need their education 
a mature and learn how to deal 
with life objectively and ration
ally.

him as a colleague and teacher 
will continue to believe that the 
decision was a grave mistake. 
But more important, it now ap
pears that the new College of 
Humanities and Social Sciences, 
as initially conceived, is being 
lost as well. According to cri
teria for promotion and tenure 
insisted upon by the Dean, 
there is an almost impassable 
chasm opening between the 
scholar teacher's desire to teach 
well and his own professional 
self-interest. Publications count; 
teaching (and by that I mean 
more than showing up in the 
classroom regularly) does not 
count. This way madness lies for 
the dedicated teacher, and disas
ter for the College. In my judg
ment it completely disregards the 
national trent toward redirecting 
the energies of the university 
back toward undergraduate edu
cation. it ignores the bulk of 
faculty and student opinion on 
this campus, and it is destructive 
of the declared aims of the New 
College itself.
We are approaching the zero 
hour for changing the direction 
of things in H&SS. There has

Education Should Liberate, Not Restrict
By SHERRY SUKOL 
&
DEBBIE HOLDSTEIN
The purpose of education is 
to liberate and not restrict . . . 
perhaps this seems to be the 
type of idea that aided in the 
conception of H &SS, yet, one 
James K. Hastie has said this 
just recently after his contract 
was not renewed for the coming 
year. Liberated, independent 
education seemed to be the 
goals of the New College, yet, 
due to pressure by the nebulous 
contracts, senates and senior 
faculty members, some of the 
English instructors that have 
had the most beneficial and in
fluential effect on the students 
of H & S S are being dropped. 
The reasons? They vary from 
you have not published enough 
evidence of research to you 
havent received your PHD '. 
One of the less obvious reasons 
seems to be that the senior fac
ulty members feel threatened 
by the new. innovative ideas 
that are an inherent part of H 
&SS, and fear that the authori
tarian class control on which 
they thrive will become obso
lete.
It may be that Hastie's meth
ods of teaching, as well as his 
ideas, are considered too radi
cal. In order to improve com
munication and inter-class rela
tionships, Professor Hastie has 
instigated the group test, en
abling students to pool their 
knowledge on a specific situa
tion and arrive at a collective 
answer. Hastie himself has stat
ed that the more conventional 
methods of teaching don't allow 
the teacher to have as much 
contact with the class. Prof. 
Hastie feels that the structure of
society wrongly teaches depend
ence on authority, thus "narrow
ing the process of learning". It 
may appear to many that Mr. 
Hastie has a lack of control over 
his class, yet his students have ' 
found his courses to be both per
sonally meaningful as well as 
profitable. Prof. Hastie does not 
ask his students to regurgitate 
material; instead he induces 
them to ask the right questions 
not to give the right answers. 
The professor also finds his 
classes to be profitable as he 
feels that teaching should be 
an important learning experi
ence for the teacher as well as 
the student, both in and out of 
the classroom.
James Hastie was attracted to 
C-MU because of its relaxed at
mosphere and the freedom in
herent in the new Literary Im
agination courses. Unfortunate
ly, he has found the new col
lege to be quite flexible on 
paper, yet rather authoritarian 
in practice. To Prof. Hastie, what 
happens in the classroom is im
portant, especially where the 
well-being of the teacher and 
student is concerned (I love to 
teach . . I am happy in the 
classroom).
The more specialized educa
tion becomes, the less reason 
students will find to go into it. 
The educational process will take 
place outside of the school as 
well as in it. It should not 
have to be a forced, apprehen
sion, rather it should be" a 
process training people how not 
to be dependent. It involves 
learning how to think and make 
their own choices . . working 
towards their fullest potentials 
rather than for a grade."Dean Siekman
The True Purpose of Education
by Devy Cassey
We started off talking about 
the purpose of a college educa
tion. Dean Robert Siekman sat 
astride the chair which he had 
just turned around, so he could 
rest his arms and chin on its 
back. Occasionally while think
ing out an answer, he would 
plav with a molecular model 
putting its shape into different 
configurations.
Explaining what college should 
give to an undergraduate stu
dent. Dr. Siekman said that 
some of the most important as
sets of college is that it gets 
students away from home and 
that it exposes them to the very 
important non-academic side of 
college life, including a more 
diverse set of peers.
"I feel less than most people 
that college is to provide pro
fessional training." Dr. Siekman 
continued that college's primary 
and initial purpose should be to 
provide students with an op
portunity to learn about "others, 
and values, and goals." Learn
ing specific tasks should, in an 
ideal situation, be postponed  
perhaps about three years  un
til undergraduates have a more 
distinct idea about what tasks 
they want to learn. Initially 
though, the most desirable goal 
is to learn a philosophy of life. 
Most students are motivated thusly. and Dr. Siekman believes 
that not enough advantage is tak
en of this motivation.
There is a national disap
pointment factor involved, in that 
a great number of students com
plain of not getting what they 
wanted or expected of their col
lege experience. An explanation 
for this, says Dr. Siekman. is 
that in our society college is 
idealized; and it inevitably prov
es to be a great letdown to 
many.
Dr. Siekman is presently the 
dean to freshman students en
rolled in Carnegie Institute of 
Technology, and he teaches an 
organic chemistry course for the 
Chemistry Department.
A high percentage of those in 
the engineering and science 
fields are studying in those 
fields for the wrong reasons, he 
says. Dr. Siekman explained that 
since society presently gives such 
high status to scientists, engin
eers. and doctors, many people 
enter these professions to gain a 
feeling of success. As a result, 
those who are not actually suit
ed to the field turn out to be 
unhappy in it. And it is also 
these people who are difficult 
to stimulate and interest in the 
classroom.
As for himself, Dr. Siekman 
found that research was not 
deeply satisfying. He enjoys 
teaching and the aspect of try
ing to help people. Usually, he 
explains, it is easier to help an 
individual rather than a whole 
class; and this is what he finds 
particularly satisfying.
The chemistry course that 
Dr. Siekman teaches is a lec
ture of about 90 students which 
splits up one day a week into 
smaller recitation sections. He 
considers teaching to be half 
of a process that involves a 
dialogue." not getting up and 
talking before a large roomful 
of persons. Real "teaching in
volves someone who wants to 
gain understanding and someone 
who wants to help. and who 
will listen, not just talk.
It is not too important, he 
feels, to put on entertainment 
in order to teach and keep the
attention of the class. But the 
person teaching should be inter
ested in the subject and in try
ing to get the subject across.
We went on to talk about meth
ods of selecting teachers. Dr. 
Siekman feels that student eval
uation is very important, that 
the faculty evaluation put out 
by A Phi 0 was good, but that 
there should be some structure 
so that everybody can easily 
participate. He believes that a 
student should feel that his 
wishes should contribute to the 
process of the university. One 
method of accumplishing this 
would be to assign some recent 
graduates to seats on the Board 
of Trustees, so they can become 
involved in all sorts of deci
sions about the university. One 
limiting factor, though, in hav
ing students have more of a say 
in teacher selection is that the 
students themselves have just a 
short commitment to the univer
sity.
He suggested that there could 
be an objective and also sym
pathetic method of observing and 
rating teachers. He emphasizes 
"sympathetic so that it would 
be used not just as a weapon, 
but as a source of constructive 
criticism. An idea of Dr. Siekman's is to have teachers per
iodically select other teachers 
to observe them; and a professor 
could also have one of his class
es videotaped so that he could 
see his teaching techniques for 
himself.
Dr. Siekman received his B.A. 
in chemistry from the University 
of Pennsylvania. He later re
ceived his Ph.D. from M.I.T. 
Following his postdoctoral work 
at M.I.T.. Dr. Siekman came to 
CMU.

The one exlusive sign of a thorough 
knowledge is the power of teaching.
? ? ? ARISTOTLEThomas Kerr, Smiling and Legal
Thomas Kerr
A Man Involved With the World
Stimulating students to re
spond to and discuss ideas is the 
salient feature of Thomas Kerr's 
courses. Kerr is a lecturer in in
dustrial administration and law 
at GSIA. In courses such as his 
"Ideas and The Changing En
vironment, " student participation 
in lively class discussions pro
vides an exciting change of 
pace.
A lawyer with experience in 
anti-trust and constitutional law 
cases. Kerr is well qualified to 
present important philosophical 
ideas in a framework of real 
world applications. He partici
pated in the last decade in the 
major nationwide price fixing 
cases in the electrical manufac
turing and plumbing fixtures in
dustries. For the last two years 
he has been participating in sel
ective service cases at the ap
pellate court level. These cases 
have resulted in major changes 
in procedures involving the draft. 
Kerr points out that while his 
work at C-MU does not involve 
research and publication in the 
usual sense, that for a lawyer, 
the preparation and filing of 
briefs in appellate cases, espe
cially the important threshold 
cases, constitute a creative facet 
of his work.
Kerr s wide experience and un
common teaching ability com
bine to make him a valuable re
source to the campus. Rarely are 
we blessed with such a teacher 
who at once is able, drawing 
from relevant and broad exper
ience. to present exciting ideas 
and at the same time focus upon 
their worldly day to day impli
cations.

Who bounces into a classroom, 
hair trailing down over a turtle 
neck, bell-bottoms accentuating 
his sprightly gait? Ninety per 
cent of the underclass men you 
say. No, Im talking about Phil 
Yetton, Instructor of Elements 
of Industrial Administration, 
candidate for Ph.D. in the Grad
uate School of Industrial Admin
istration. and human being. 
That last phrase is said any
thing but facetidiously. Phil (it 
would almost seem disrespectful 
to call him Mr. Yetton i has a 
human warmth that many pro
fessors find cumbersome in their 
role as academic prophets.
There are two sources of au
thority open to an instructor. One 
is by position, the other is by 
"expertise ". Sadly, some profes
sors rely on the first of these. 
This, however, is artificial au
thority and unless it is reinforc
ed by this "expertise " it can 
never bring respect of the in
structor by the students. Phil 
recognizes this and encourages 
his students to take an active 
role in the educational process. 
The respect that the students 
have for Phil s ability gives him 
all the authority he needs.
I sat in on Phil s class last 
week to see if he had changed 
his teaching techniques since 
last semester when I was in his 
1-201 section. He has nearly 
twice as many students in his 
section this term, and his class 
meets in Scaife 10 instead of a 
classroom. Phil remarked to me 
after the class that he preferred 
working with a smaller group 
in which he could get more stu
dents involved in discussion. 
Phil's teaching techniques 
haven't changed at all.
Phil was born and educated. 
until last year, in England. His 
British accent and colloquialisms 
were the hit of our class last se
mester. He could never under
stand the puzzled looks he re
ceived when he informed us that 
a paper was due at "tea time" 
or Monday week " (a week from 
Monday, blokes or when he
A Human Being
asked if we had any "queries 
(questions.
Phil spent his undergraduate 
years at Cambridge, did gradu
ate work at Liverpool, and held 
a junior research post at Man
chester. At Cambridge, a system 
of tutorials brought a student 
and a faculty member from his 
chosen field together in a close 
educational relationship. The 
supervisor and student would 
together decide the course of 
the student's work and would 
discuss any problems the student 
was experiencing.
Phil bases his concept of an 
ideal educational system on the 
Cambridge tutorial system. He 
feels, however, that the personal 
student-to-instructor relationship 
should be extended to become 
the single most important aspect 
of the system. While final exams 
were given once a year at Cam
bridge. Phil sees no need for 
exams. Continuous evaluation, 
not necessarily based on grades, 
would be the responsibility of 
the supervisor.
Lectures and large classes are 
not completely eliminated in 
this system. These are accepta
ble for basic courses in each 
field. There would also be a 
series of mini-courses from which 
a student could gain insight into 
varied fields he would not nor
mally have time to pursue. The 
nucleus of the educational en
vironment. however, would de
finitely be at the lowest possi
ble student-teacher ratio, pre
ferably one-to-one.$a
Of course the cost of running 
such a system would be prohi
bitive. but it does show where 
Phil's interests lie.
The day I attended Phils 
class, he was discussing a paper 
the students had written the 
previous week. The subject of 
the paper: grading systems and 
how they affect students' be
havior. Why such a topic in a 
course in industrial adminis
tration? The topics to be ex
plored were organizations, rolesets. incentive systems, but in 
presenting these as critique of
grades he is making them high
ly relevant to his students. 
Grades were a tangible link be
tween the students and the rather 
abstract mechanism of incentive 
systems in the business world.
The papers being discussed 
were identified by codes of let
ters and numbers known only to 
each individual author. Phil pre
fers this. He hopes that this may 
lower the barriers built up by 
students and instructors who 
fear that extended interaction be
tween students and instructors 
may be construed as "brownieing" or favoritism. Not knowing 
the writer of any paper he can 
treat each student as a person 
without sacrificing impartiality.
After making comments about 
the papers a group. Phil suggest
ed that any student who was dis
satisfied with the grade he re
ceived discuss the matter with 
him. At the end of the semester 
there would be a further oppor
tunity to review a student's 
work for the term before final 
grades were issued.
"Those grades aren't precise." 
he admitted. In the very papers 
he was discussing the students 
had stressed the comflicting im
portance and inaccuracy of grad
es in our system. PhiHcnew this; 
he wanted the students to realize 
it for themselves.
"I'm concerned with how my 
position as evaluator, rather than 
instructor, affects your perform
ance."
Phil was attempting to estab
lish a small part of his ideal ed
ucational system bv offering 
himself as supervisor to the for
ty or so kids in his class.
In explaining incentive sys
tems to us. Phil would stress the 
relationship between ability, mo
tivation and performance. He 
showed us that the most effec
tive form of motivation was per
sonal involvement. This is true 
in the classroom as well as the 
firm. The work done in our class 
was comparable to that in any 
other class, but because we 
were involved in the decision 
making process as well as the
academic work as were more 
motivated to excel.
Education of the person, rath
er than the group. Teaching re
levance to life. Accepting auth
ority on merit rather than de
manding it by position. They 
make teaching harder, but they 
also make learning much more 
enjoyable.

more of a challenge than the electric utilities could 
give me and that's all I remember.
Most of us at Pennsylvania Power & Light Com

image some students have of the electric utility 
business. Were too busy figuring out how to better 
serve nearly 800,000 customers spread over 10,000

Tartans Top Western Reserve 91-55 
Brown Sets Field Goal Record
The Tartans had a busy week which resulted in a large assortment of emotions and re
sults. On the plus side, the CMU squad won its fourth game of the season. They defeated 
Western Reserve Saturday night, 91-55. This was their highest scoring output of the season. 
In this game, Bob Brown poured in 26 points  including 12 field goals which enabled him 
to surpass Mark Langs season record of 159. Brown now has 161 for the season with five 
games remaining.
theHowever, the Tartans came 
out on the bottom of a 90-72 
drubbing by Marietta Wednes
day night and they lost a 76-63 
decision to Case on Friday. The 
Tech record is 4-13, not includ
ing last night's game against 
Waynesburg.
Getting back to the good part 
of the weekthe Tartans had a 
30-5 scoring burst in the first 
half to put the game against 
Reserve out of reach. The tight 
CMU man-to-man defense em
ployed by CMU made the home 
team work hard for their shots 
and forced them to take many 
shots while off balance. The en
tire Tech team of players that 
made the trip to Cleveland for 
the two games broke into the 
scoring column in the big vic
tory.
The night before, the Tartans 
were involved in a close battle 
with Case until the final five 
minutes of play. The score was 
Case-34, CMU-33 at halftime. 
The home court and the local 
refs both gave Case a definite 
advantage throughout the con
test. One crucial call seemed to 
break the Tartans momentum 
in the final minutes of playBob 
Brown drove in for a scoring 
lay-up and Was fouled for an ap
parent three point play. How
ever, the official ruled that the 
foul was committed before the 
shot. Then Case pulled away 
for the win. Brown led the Tar
tans with 23 points and Jim Giv
ens topped the winners with 20.
The Tartans defeat Wednesday 
night at the hands of the Pio
neers of Marietta. C-MU showed 
promise in the opening seconds 
as they came from behind to tie 
the score at 2-2. Some clutch 
shooting and a few fast breaks 
by the Pioneers, however, put 
the game out of reach after five 
minutes of play.
At half-time the Tartans were 
already down by twenty points.
