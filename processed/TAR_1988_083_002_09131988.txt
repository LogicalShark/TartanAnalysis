Carnegie Mellon has requested 
its investment managers to hold 
a portfolio free of companies hav
ing investments or interests in 
South Africa.
This means that the University 
would prefer not to hold any stock 
of companies having interests in 
South Africa.
Exceptions to this are if the 
investment managers can dem
onstrate an outstanding or greatly 
above normal return from a par
ticular stock, or it is the stock of a 
company that is a friend of the 
University, for example a com
pany which donates heavily.
This decision came after the 
Board of Trustees voted against a 
formal declaration of divestment 
at their May 16th meeting. Car
negie Mellon President Richard 
M. Cyert was ...disappointed over
the vote. Apartheid is a terrible, 
terrible thing. It is an insult to a 
human being.
Apartheid is the policy and 
practice of strict racial segrega
tion and discrimination against
the native Negro and other col
ored peoples in South Africa, by 
the white supremacist govern
ment.
Cyert feels strongly about the 
issue and the concern both stu
dents and faculty have about 
Apartheid. Cyert backed a decla
ration of total divestment going 
into the May meeting but the vote 
was lost by a narrow margin.
There is a strong sentiment on 
the board against such a declara
tion. Some trustees feel it is in
consistent with their legal duties 
to maximize investment policy, 
Cyert stated. The trustees also 
feel it is wrong for a university to 
take a political stand.
Another consideration is for 
corporations that are our friends, 
Cyert said. Many corporations 
donate large sums of money to the 
university, and if there is a for
mal declaration of divestment, the 
university could lose some of the 
money.
We would have to say well 
take your money, but youre not 
good enough for us to hold your 
stock, and we dont want to say 
that, Cyert said. For example,
this could lead to the situation of 
a company offering the school 
donations in stock, which, under 
a formal policy of divestment, the 
school could not ethically accept.
In an effort to reach a compro-. 
mise, Cyert spoke with the trus: 
tees and sought an informal pol
icy that would reach the same 
ends.
His solution directs the invest
ment managers to avoid stocks of 
companies having South African 
interests, but does not prevent 
the school from holding such 
stocks.
The trustees accepted his sug
gestion and the University is in 
the process of selling the stock of 
companies with South African 
ties.
Ed Hunia, Treasurer of Carne
gie Mellon stated that only 12 
stocks, worth about $11.2 mil
lion, were from companies associcontinued on page 3

Last March the State of Pennsylvania 
passed a law requiring colleges and uni
versities in the state to provide informa
tion about crime on campus to all students, 
employees, and applicants.
The reports, which must be completed 
by November 26, will be updated and dis
tributed yearly to current students and 
employees and will be given to applicants 
for admission upon request.
The reports must give crime statistics 
and crime rates for the 
previous three years. The 
crime statistics will be 
based on the yearly re
ports which must be sub
mitted to the State Po
lice for publication in the 
Uniform Crime report.
The state reports list, 
along with other infor
mation, the number of 
complaints, broken down 
by type of crime, and how many incidents 
of each type were cleared by arrest or dis
covery that the complaint was unfounded.
Schools must also provide all current 
students and employees yearly informa
tion on security policies and procedures. 
The same information must be provided to 
all applicants for admission as soon as the 
applications are received and to all new 
employees when they are hired.
The information must include the num
ber of students and employees, the num
ber of security personnel, information on 
their training arid enforcement power, a 
policy on alcohol and drugs, and other in
formation related to security on campus.
There is an emphasis on questions re
lated to housing such as whether dormi
tory doors lock automatically and whether 
single sex dorms are available on request.
Thelaw, fcnown as the College and Uni-* . v _______________________________________________________
versity Security Information Act, is the first 
of its type in the country. It was passed after 
Jeanne Clery, a Lehigh University fresh
man, was raped and murdered by a fellow 
student on April 5,1986. After her death, her 
parents campaigned to make students and 
their parents more aware of security issues 
at colleges and universities.
Carnegie Mellon Police Chief James LaPaglia says that the University is planning 
to comply with the law by putting out a two 
sided, one page brochure.
He said that his department has compiled 
crime information for years, although not in 
this form. In the past very 
few students or parents have 
requested the information. 
He is in favor of the law. 
However he commented I 
think its a shame it took 
this incident [the Clery 
murder] to bring this par
ticular act about.
LaPaglia commented that 
a two page brochure will not 
be able to go into detail about 
Carnegie Mellons security program. How
ever, he invited anybody who wishes to know 
more about the program to come see him.
Although the new law does not require any 
minimum standards for security it is as
sumed that many schools will improve their 
procedures now that they must describe them 
to students and parents.
According to LaPaglia this has happened 
to some degree at Carnegie Mellon. He said 
that Right after the proposed bill came out 
we took a look at what we were doing here on 
campus to see if theres anything we can do 
to improve.
He mentioned that one change that was 
made was to add security patrols for the Hill 
Dorms, Morewood Gardens, and Mudge be
tween 11 pm and 7 am. The officers do not 
patrol inside the dorms but walk around the 
outside of the buildings and check for such 
things as doors left propped open.
Its C shame it took 
this incident [the 
Clery murder] to bring 
this particular act 
about. 
Chief LaPaglia
University adopts city smoking policy
By JONATHAN LEVY
Tartan Assistant News Editor
As required by a Pittsburgh law passed last Novem
ber, Carnegie Mellon has announced a policy on smok
ing.
The policy bans indoor smoking on campus except in 
specified places. Areas in which smoking is permitted 
include fully enclosed private offices, private areas in 
dormitories (primarily rooms), and certain sections of 
the dining facilities.
Smoking is permitted in private offices if the occu
pant of the office agrees and the office is fully enclosed. 
An office is considered fully enclosed if it has floor to 
ceiling walls and the door is closed.
Smoking is only permitted in multi-person offices if 
they are fully enclosed and all the occupants are smok
ers. Director of Environmental Health and Safety 
Peter Collopy said that the policy was purposely writ
ten to say that all the occupants must be smokers, 
rather than a combination of smokers and non-smok
ers who do not object. The intention was to prevent 
non-smokers from being coerced into allowing others 
to smoke. However, Collopy pointed out that nonsmokers who truly do not object can simply claim to be 
smokers for the purposes of the policy.
Departments may request that particular areas be 
turned into smoking lounges. Collopys office will ex
amine the areas and if they decide that smoking will 
not invade the rights of others outside the lounge they 
will grant approval.
Under the smoking policy each dining facility on 
campus must set aside at least 20 percent of its seats 
as non-smoking areas. Collopy says that the dining 
areas will, in practice, have 25 to 50 percent of their 
seats labeled as non-smoking. The one exception is the 
dining room in Mellon Institute which has no restric
tions on smoking because it seats less than 50 people.
According to the policy any person who wishes to sit 
in a non-smoking area in the other facilities will be ac
commodated. Collopy explained that this does not nec
essarily mean that the person will be able to be seated 
in a non-smoking area immediately if there is no room 
but that the non-smoking areas will be adjusted to 
avoid future problems.
Smoking is virtually unrestricted in dormitories 
and other university owned housing. Collopy explained 
that under the Pittsburgh smoking statute housing 
areas are considered private residences and are ex
empt from the ordinance. Collopy said that the Hous
ing Office and Student Dormitory Council will set the

Television cable should be installed in dormitory TV 
rooms by the end of September according to Director of 
Housing Anthony M. Martin. Pittsburgh Telecommunica
tions, the citys only cable company, has already started 
wiring the Hill dorms and will move north.
The cable service will be a standard 30-channel pack
age. Local television stations as well as cable channels 
such as C-SPAN, CNN, Arts & Entertainment, Nickelo
deon, the Weather Channel, and the Pittsburgh bulletin 
board are included on the system.
No pay or movie channels will be included with the 
service. Distributors like HBO and Showtime will not 
allow the cable company to install their services in public 
areas such as dormitory TV rooms.
This summer the local cable operator notified the Hous
ing Office that it was prepared to begin installation. Crews 
first arrived around Aug. 20 to wire the Hill.
When the cable company was informed that under
ground conduits for the campus-wide communications 
network were available for some Hill dormitories, it ex
plored the possibility of using them with Assistant Direc
tor of Telecommunications Gregory J. Dobrich. The altercontlnued on page 3

RANGOON, Burma (AP)  
Army trucks loaded with troops 
rolled toward the center of the 
capital Wednesday with orders to 
shoot looters, who were sacking 
government buildings, factories 
and farms. It was the first time in 
nearly three weeks that the mili
tary presence had been obvious in 
Rangoon, where looting broke out 
Tuesday.
The U.S. Embassy in Rangoon 
ordered an evacuation of 95 
American dependents as a pre
cautionary measure, said Ross 
Petzing, the U.S. Embassy spokes
man in Bangkok. The evacuees 
were sent to Bangkok.
By Thursday, top government 
officials, soldiers and intelligence 
agents had joined about 1 million 
people from all walks of life in 
peaceful marches for democracy 
and a strike that brought the 
capital to a standstill.
On Friday, Burmas former 
leader said he had formed a rival 
government to take power from 
the forces that ousted him 26 years 
ago and imposed single-party rule.
Former Prime Minister U Nu, 
in a letter distributed to diplo
matic missions, also announced 
general elections Oct. 9.
About 200 uniformed air force 
men fled their base and took ref
uge in dormitories at Rangoon 
University in the first major mili
tary defection.
We side with democracy and 
not with fascists! and Our mili
tary training is not to shoot 
people! the soldiers shouted in
side the university, the headquar
ters for student revolt. Students 
guarded them.
The letter, signed by the 82- 
year-old U Nu, unveiled a 25- 
member government with him
self as prime minister, former 
President Mahn Win Maung as 
president and retired Gen. Tin

MOSCOW (AP)  A malfunc
tion of a Soviet spacecrafts guid
ance system Tuesday forced two 
cosmonauts to delay their return 
to Earth for one day.
A newspaper said their life 
support systems would last just 
two more days and food was run
ning low.
Aboard the Soyuz-TM 5 capside were Abdul Ahad Mohmand, 
29, the first Afghan in space, and 
Soviet crewmate Vladimir 
Lyakhov, 47. They were return
ing from the orbiting space sta
tion Mir, where they spent six 
days.
The government daily Izvestia 
and the Tass news agency said 
life support systems aboard the 
capsule are designed to last two 
days.
However, a Soviet space offi
cial, speaking on condition of 
anonymity, said the cosmonauts 
could stretch supplies of oxygen, 
water and food for up to a week. 
He did not explain how the oxy
gen supply could be stretched out.
The cosmonauts landed safely 
on Wednesday.
U.S. stops mail 
shipments to Britain
WASHINGTON (AP)  The 
U.S. Postal Service announced 
Wednesday it is immediately 
embargoing mail to Britain be
cause of a strike by postal work
ers in that country.
British postal deliveries are 
nearly at a halt and 100 million 
pieces of undelivered mail have 
piled up in a week-old nationwide 
strike that idled more than half of 
the countrys 180,000 postal work
ers.
The embargo was requested 
by the British postal administra
tion because of its inability to 
handle any volume of mail, a 
Postal Service statement said.
Mail to Britain will be returned 
to senders. People who get such 
mail back can apply to their local 
post office for a refund of the 
postage.

WASHINGTON(DJ)Reflect
ing election-year pressure to take 
a strong stand against illegal 
drugs, the House voted over
whelmingly to add a series of 
tough and potentially far-reach
ing provisions to the omnibus drug 
bill.
After approving stiff penalties
 ranging from loss of federal 
benefits to execution  for drugrelated crimes, lawmakers voted 
to narrow the long-standing con
stitutional principle that excludes 
from use at trial any evidence
that has been gained illegally.
In a departure from Supreme 
Court decisions dating back to 
1914, lawmakers voted 259-134 
to allow prosecutors to introduce 
evidence in trials that was ob
tained without a search warrant 
as long as police believed they 
were complying with the Fourth 
Amendments protection against 
illegal search and seizure. The 
provision, sponsored by Rep. 
Daniel Lungren (R., Calif.), is not 
limited to drug-related cases.
The Reagan administration has 
long sought this change in the 
legal principle, known as the 
exclusionary rule. The admini
stration argues that the rule 
hampers police who, while not 
following the letter of the law, act 
in good faith.
The provision will likely face 
opposition in the Senate and scru
tiny by the courts. Senators are 
working on an omnibus drug bill 
of their own.
Earlier, lawmakers voted 299-
111 to permit the execution of 
those convicted in federal courts 
of drug-related killings. The 
amendment, offered by Rep. 
George Gekas (R., Pa.), also would 
allow courts to impose prison 
terms of at least 20 years on those 
convicted of a drug-related kill
ing.
The House included a similar 
death-penalty provision in its 
version of the 1986 drug bill, but 
the Senate blocked it. The provi
sion could face problems this year.
The House also voted 335-67 to 
deny a broad range of federal 
benefits, including student loans, 
public housing and veterans 
benefits, to repeat drug-law of
fenders. Only retirement, welfare, 
health and disability benefits 
would be exempt.
The legislation would require 
chemical makers and distributors 
to keep records and file periodic 
reports about sales and shipments 
of chemicals that could be used to 
make illegal drugs. The measure 
would also strengthen record 
keeping requirements for large 
cash transactions at banks and 
savings and loan institutions to 
combat money laundering by drug 
dealers.

NEW YORK (DJ)  Real in
come for American households has 
been rising steadily throughout 
most of this decade, to a median 
level of $26,000 in 1987 from 
$24,400 in 1980, a rise of 6.5 
percent.
But not everyone has shared 
equally in these inflation-adjusted 
gains, according to the U.S. Cen
sus Bureaus annual income sur
vey. While the median incomes of 
households headed by whites rose
6.5 percent and those by black; 
4.3 percent, households headed 
by Hispanics showed an increase 
of just 2.6 percent over the period
The primary reason for this 
divergence is that the heads of 
Hispanic households are on average younger than those of whit* 
and black households.
The incomes of younger people 
havent risen as much as those of 
middle-aged workers.

Patrick J. Keating was ap
pointed to the newly formed posi' tion of Vice President of Univer
sity Planning on July 1,1988.
As a result of his new position, 
Keating will spend more time 
working with Carnegie Mellon 
President Richard Cyert in both
* long-range and strategic plan
ning. He will also increase his 
involvement with the Deans and 
Department Heads in the plan
ning of their units.
The completion of the campus 
master plan is one of Keatings 
long-range priorities. He feels that 
it is going to take a long time to 
complete, but states, If we can 
complete that (master plan) we 
will have a quality of facilities 
and quality of campus environ
ment that we say weve wanted 
all along and one that is really 
consistent with the quality of our 
student body and faculty. 
Communication between the facUuph mAhfushor mCrAupn RhCruoe
ulty and the administration is 
another one of Keatings priori
ties. He is in the process of draw
ing up a set of recommendations 
that will increase the communi
cation between the two groups.
By way of his appointment, 
Keating will become a member of
the Capital Allocation Board, the 
Space Allocation Board and the 
Resource Allocation Board. As 
Director of Planning it was 
Keatings job assist these boards 
in their endeavors. He feels that 
as a member of these boards he 
will be able to contribute much in 
the way of input that his staff 
position did not allow.
Keating, who held the position 
Director of University Planning 
for the last five years, is going to 
try to gradually leave the day-today operations to Jeffery W. 
Bolton. Bolton, one of Keatings 
staff members, has been named 
as the new director of Planning.
Keating completed his under
graduate work at the University 
of Michigan where he received a 
bachelor of arts degree in eco
nomics in 1970. He also completed 
a Masters degree in public policy 
studies at theUniversity ofMichigan in 1974. Keating obtained a 
doctorate in higher education 
administration from Michigan 
State University in 1988.

CMU to sell all South African holdings
continued from page 1
ated with South Africa. This is 
out of a $265 million endow
ment, of which $140 million is 
comprised of stocks. Hunia 
stated, The target date is Sep
tember 30. By that time most 
all of our [South African tied] 
stocks should be sold.
Hunia said that what the Uni
versity is doing in such a short 
time (2 months) has taken 
schools with formal divestment 
policies several years to accom
plish. He added that many 
schools such as the University 
of Pittsburgh and Harvardhave 
officially declared divestment 
policies but continue to hold 
stock in South African tied 
companies because they accept 
gifts of stock from them.
Hunia said that Carnegie 
Mellon doesnt want to lose fi
nancial contributions because
they go toward the students in 
forms like financial aid. But they 
feel strongly enough about the 
issue and the concerns of stu
dents and faculty that they want 
to do something.
Cyert met with students from 
the National Society of Black 
Engineers (NSBE), Students 
Against Apartheid, and Spirit in 
early August to discuss the issue. 
Lalisa Lawrence, NSBE Presi
dent, stated, This is a move in 
the right direction, but its not 
what we wanted to happen. We 
understand the position the uni
versity is in, but whats to say, 
since this isnt an official policy or 
declaration, that next year or in 
the future, the school will con
tinue with this unwritten rule.
Mike Bowman, Vice President 
of Spirit stated at the August 
meeting that We want a public 
statement of divestment.
Everyone seems to agree that I; 
the Presidents decision is of ' 
help, but not a final solution. 
Lawrence said, I cant say if5 
well do anything more, or stop 
right here.
The issue of divestment tran
scends campus boundaries. At 
a city council meeting this sum
mer, two councilmen did not 
want to approve the permits 
for the East Campus Project 
dormitory construction because 
of the trustees vote against a 
formal policy of divestment. A 
majority of the council later ap
proved the construction.
Cyert said, This is an in
vestment free South African 
policy that will be maintained. 
While this is not a formal state 
of divestment, we plan to have 
no holdings in South Africa, 
and a strong statement against 
Apartheid.

tial areas. However he made 
the point that If they come 
up with a policy, its strictly a 
policy within the dormitory 
system. There is no require
ment from the law.
Housing Director Anthony 
Martin said that the Student 
Dormitory Council will be pri
marily responsible for formu
lating the smoking policy in 
residence areas.
He expects that they willbe 
organized and ready to begin 
work on the policy in a week 
or two.
Individual departments are 
responsible for enforcing the 
policy in their own areas.
Security will enforce the 
policy in areas which do not 
belong to any particular de
partment. r
Collopy said penalties for 
violating the policy will be 
taken care of through the 
normal disciplinary channels 
such as University Citations.
However, Collopy advised 
that members of the Univer
sity community first go 
through their own depart
ments before calling in Secu
rity.
Collopy also said that in ad
dition toUniversitypenalties, 
violators are also subject to 
city fines ranging from $50 to 
$500. He said that city penal
ties will only be used as a last 
resort, afterUniversity chan
nels have been exhausted.

THE SLEEPING BAG CAMPAIGN
This fall is approaching quickly and so are the annual Sleeping Bag Weekends. This year, the 
Admissions office will have four sleeping bag weekends for high school students interested in the 
university. Due to the popularity of the programs, increasing numbers of students have been 
attending. That is why we need you to help usl
If you would like to take part in these events, there are a couple of ways that you can help:
Escorts Your role is to take groups of students to the dorms in which they will be staying.
Hosts Your contribution is to be in your room during arrival times to greet the studentls) and 
then to provide them with a place to sleep.

Without formally announcing a 
policy of divestment, President 
Richard M. Cyert has promised a 
South African-free endowment 
portfolio by the first week in Octo
ber.
, Walkingatightropebetweenthe
 Board of Trustees and the anti' apartheid student organizations,
Cyert has devised a scheme in 
which the University will sell the 
South African-tied stock it currently owns and will only accept 
apartheid-tainted stock as gifts 
from friends of the University.
Though his policy does not take 
: a clear-cut stand for or against di
vestment, Cyert has chosen the 
most honest route possible to keep 
maximum contributions coming 
into the University while at the 
same time making a statement 
against racial oppression in South 
Africa.
, Other universities who claim a 
, policy of divestment  for ex
ample, Harvard and the UniverSouth African-tied stock if re
ceived as gifts. Clearly this an 
abhorrent practice that is dishon
est to everyone.
Hard-line divestment advocates, 
though, might argue that Cyerts 
high wire act is another CMU buy
out; in other words, Carnegie 
Mellons moral stance stops short 
in its quest for the all-mighty 
dollar.
And it might beif divestment 
is indeed the better road to follow.
However, facing a Board deci
sion not to divest, this is the best 
deal that Cyert could cut.
The President is caught in a 
difficult position. As the head of a 
large corporation, he has to keep 
money coming into that corpora
tion, but, as an educator and 
human being, he disapproves of 
racial discrimination.
By publicly opposing the Board 
of Trustees decision when asking 
for a clean portfolio, Cyert is doing 
what he personally considers
sity of Pittsburgh  will still hold morally correct.

We know, we know, youre sick
 and tired of being told to register 
to votekind of like youre sick of 
hearing your roommates Whitesnake album or learning the name 
of yet another decision-making 
method but we're gonna ask you 
again: Why arent you registered 
to vote? Maybe you are, but forgot 
to order an absentee ballot from 
your home state, and the deadline
. has passed, so you think youre off 
' the hook. No dice guys. All youve 
 got to do to register or re-register 
is to fill out a simple postage paid 
, form, available on campus from 
the College Democrats table out
side Doherty, or from the Post 
Office, and drop it in any mailbox.
Why register? Because you want 
to be able to vote, right? Or maybe, 
you claim, you dont want to vote, 
you dont care whos in the White 
'House, andyou dont want to have 
,to bother to go to the polls on 
November 8th. Maybe you think 
you cant make a difference, that 
1 government never changes, that 
it just shifts into the hands of a 
different group of essentially identical officials.
- The prevalence of this attitude 
1 is, of course, appalling, but not 
very surprising when you consider 
, that the current group of under
graduates ranged in age from 10
to 14 when the Reagan admini
stration came to power. Although 
we may vaguely remember, or 
have studied since, various politi
cal and administrative shifts in 
our government, the fact of the 
matter is that we, as a group, have 
never been politically conscious 
during a period in which a major 
administrative change was pos
sible.
This is our first chance to vote in 
a Presidential election. Young 
people, especially college students, 
for whom issues such as funding 
for education should be particu
larly important, should be a 
powerful voting block whom the 
candidates try to win. Political 
apathy, however, has made young 
people a disproportionately small 
segment of the voting population.
Change in government is a slow 
process. Your vote will not make 
immediate and radical changes, 
but it will start the system mov
ing in the direction we choose. 
Tomorrow we will have to live 
with the legacy of the political 
decisions we make, or fail to make, 
today. So get out there, register, 
and dont forget to vote. Its not 
like no one will be reminding you, 
and you wont get graded on it, so 
what the hell, take a few friends 
with you, it might even be fun.

Debunking the myths behind Carnegie Mellon
In The Mexican Pet, Jan Harold Brunvamd describes several urban legends 
modern myths of our culture. The title 
essay, for example, is the story of a woman 
who, during a trip to Mexico, buys what 
she thinks is a cute, small dog. When she 
returns to the United States, a friend 
properly identifies the pet. Its a large 
rat.
Theres one small problem with this 
storyits fiction. Yetithas appeared in 
newspapers as fact. People claim to know 
someone to whom this has happened. 
But it never did.
Carnegie Mellon has its share of myths 
as well. Heres a sample:
Myth #1: CMU has the second highest 
workload and the second highest suicide 
rate of all colleges. To this myth, youre 
supposed to respond, A coincidence? I 
dont think so. A rational person, how
ever, realizes that the workload cant be 
measured, nor can suicide rates be ranked 
considering that  on average  only 
one occurs every three years.
Myth #2: Mister Rogers (of the Neigh
borhood) lives in Mansion Park apartEric W. Leuliette
ments (the big building by Schenley 
Park).The Admissions Office used to tell 
prospective students this for years. Evi
dently he moved without telling them.
Myth #3 '.Andrew Carnegie had Baker 
Hall built with sloped hallways so he 
could turn it into a factory if the school 
failed. This is another Admissions Office 
myth. You can find it in the Word too. A 
University publication made for the 
University Center design competition 
disputes this legend.
Myth #4: Last year Carnegie Mellon 
accepted the same number of men as 
women. How this rumor got spread 
around so quickly is beyond me. Under 
federal law CMU must be sex-blind in its 
admissions procedures. For more than 
eight years the number of applications, 
acceptances, and matriculations has been 
in a two to one male/female ratio.
Myth #5: The Housing Office groups
gays on a floor in Scobell Hall (Or is it 
McGill?) Occasionally they get wild and 
run naked through the hallway. If you 
believe that, you probably believe men 
can get pregnant from toilet seats.
Myth #6: One in three Carnegie Mellon 
men is gay. This myth was popular at 
freshman camp one year and it still per
sists. No one really knows how many 
homosexuals there are in any popula
tion. More specifically, no survey has 
been taken on this campus.
Myth #7: Theres a ten year waiting list 
for student office space in Skibo. No, 
there are ways to get space. How else 
could the Student Union have gotter. 
office space ahead of older organizations:
Myth #8: Student Affairs Dean Braden 
Walters name has an s in it. It doesnt, 
even though hes given up correcting 
people.
So be skeptical about what you hear 
during your stay at Carnegie Mellon and 
remember that 73 percent of all statis
tics are false.

Why doesnt CMU test students for knowledge
The median score for the exam was a 
40. How often have you come to class 
after an exam and heard this? Or how 
many times have you gotten what you 
thought was a good grade on an exam, 
only to find out that because of the curve 
you got a C? It happens all the time, at 
CMU and everywhere else, because pro
fessors dont take the time to create exams 
that truly measure knowledge.
A grade for a course should not be given 
based on how a student does in relation 
to the other students. Why? Because, 
supposedly, there is some sort of objec
tive knowledge being tested and objec
tive knowledge should not be measured 
with relativistic grades.
Exams should be structured so that 
they test a specific, objective body of 
knowledge, not so that they are a strict 
competition between each student in the 
class. This relativistic grading system 
negatively affects students by making 
them compete too strongly with each 
other. It also prevents grades from being 
an accurate measure of achievement.
To those who would argue that compe
tition is a part of the business world and 
Carnegie Mellon is only training stu
dents to enter that world, I reply that the 
ability to cooperate is more difficult to
60 Coarse 
Michael D.C. Drout
learn and of a greater value than the 
ability to compete and that Carnegie 
Mellon neglects cooperation in favor of 
competition: in a grading system b&sed 
on a bell-curve, another students good 
performance can hurt the grade that you 
get, making you less likely to help him. 
So, grading on a curve undermines the 
development of the important social skill 
of cooperation  a skill in which many 
Carnegie Mellon students are sorely 
lacking.
Two years ago, a student I knew in 
Statics of Deformable Solids with a 94 
average received a C as his mid-semes
ter grade. The way the course is graded, 
the same thing-could happen this year. 
This is completely ridiculous. Tests are 
supposed to measure whether or not the 
student has learned the material, not if 
student* has done better than student^. 
If a student has learned 94 percent of the 
course material, he deserves an A. No 
question about it.
In the same vein, a test in which the
median grade is a 40 is simply not an 
accurate measure of whether or not a 
student has learned the material for the 
class. When the grades are all this low, 
dumb luck and guessing become more 
important than actual knowledge. A 
professor who bases his grades on exams 
like this might just as well pull name: 
out of a hat to determine who gets what 
grades.
The fallacy that the grades in a class 
should be normally distributed and the 
laziness of professors who make up an 
exam and simply apply a curve to try to 
repair the mess that their poor prepara
tion has created are negatively affecting 
the learning experience of students at 
Carnegie Mellon. And until professor: 
are willing to admit this and apply them
selves to creating accurate grading crite
ria, grades at CMU will not be a correci 
assessment of a students actual per 
formance.

You never see them, but the 
key men in this presidential race 
are the members of the elite 
Special Scurrilous Presidential 
Campaign SWAT Teams. They 
are stashed away in the bun
kers of the candidates head
quarters and their job is to dis
seminate wild and hairy stories 
about the opposition. I managed 
to get in charge of five political 
yuppies sitting around the table 
under an electoral map of the 
United States.
The man on the phone yelled 
out, Upstairs wants us to at
tack whats-his-name for his soft 
stance on crime. What can we 
come up with?
One of the workers said, How 
about our candidate saying that 
his opponent is not only soft on 
crime but he is the Hillside 
Serial Killer of Cape Cod?
It is dirty enough, someone 
agreed. But upstairs will never 
let our guy say that.
All the better. Well insert it 
in a TV commercial, and then 
our candidate will insist he had 
nothing to do with the charge 
and deplores those kind of po
litical tactics in a presidential 
campaign. Its a twofer.-We get 
to play dirty and he gets to play 
clean with the same story.
Art Bnchwald
Good going, the man in charge 
said. Now we have to do some
thing to dramatize the 
oppositions stance on defense. 
Ive been working on that one, 
said Red Suspenders. We will 
say the reason whats-his-name 
is weak on defense is that he has 
refused to recite the Pledge of 
Allegiance to the Flag for the last 
20 years.
We better trial-balloon it, just 
in case people dont buy it. Any
thing happen on us maintaining 
that whats-his-name burned the 
American flag during the war in 
Grenada?
Were putting out a story that it 
was not the candidate but his 
mother who did it.
Will they believe it?
Of course they will. How could 
anybody make something like that 
up?
Has anyone dealt with the God 
Bless America issue?
Were going to leak a story that 
if he is elected President whatshis-name has promised the ACLU 
that he will ban the song from all 
three networks, if he has to stack
the Supreme Court to do it. 
That should play in Orange 
County. Our man will gladly 
insert it into his speech with
out asking us where we got the 
information.
We can get more votes by 
accusing their side of a God 
Bless America ban than ex
plaining how were going to 
balance the budget. 
Speaking of votes, the boss 
wants us to give him something 
as good as the stuff we put on 
whats-his-names mental 
health, Striped Tie said.
Tell him were working on it. 
What do you guys think of this? 
We say that if Shorty is elected, 
anybody over 5-foot-1 will lose 
his right to bear arms. That 
will scare the hell out of Texas. 
Thats a little far-fetched. 
Who is going to believe it? 
The people. They wont be
lieve it the first time we say it, 
and they wont belive the sec
ond time we say it  but the 
third time around they will eat 
the whole thing.
How can you be so sure?

Senate, the never-ending story
The Student Senate is a won
derful source of enjoyment and 
serious material every year, but 
with the exception of the occa
sional Tartan or Student Union 
editorial, there is hardly anyone 
to criticize or praise the job that 
Senate does. This is about to 
change.
The Senate is not just the resume-filler that a lot of people think 
it is. Senators do more than just 
go to a bunch of meetings. They 
allocate almost $400,000 a year. 
They are responsible for all the 
traffic signs that are now around 
campus. They act as the voice of 
the students whether the students 
agree or not.
Student Senate can be a great 
source of controversy and infor
mation. It can also be a very en
tertaining evening when you dont 
have something due the next day. 
So, because they didnt deal with 
any exciting issues, like political 
organizations or the great budget 
debate, Id like to look at last 
weeks meeting as if it were enter
tainment.
Ill be honest and say that I 
missed the overture to last weeks 
performance, the roll call and 
amending of the minutes. Then 
again, this part is usually just a 
bunch of senators complaining 
that their names are spelled with 
an e, not a w, or that at last weeks 
meeting they said that they were 
actually in favor of dismantling 
the whosawhatzit, not that they

before, and he chose someone who 
had excellent credentials: a rich, 
conservative Southern Democrat 
named Lloyd Bentsen. In fact, 
Bentsen is the sort of Democrat 
who

1988 campaign, 
where ethics matter 
and Issues dont
Dukakis 
only agrees 
with when 
it comes to 
raising 
taxes and 
hating 
Donald 
Trump.
Bentsen 
does provide one big
plus - hes already beaten Bush 
once in an election. However, hes 
not so confident this time, since 
hes still running for reelection in 
the Senate. Considering how 
much the Vice President does, 
even if the Democrats win Bentsen 
may opt to keep his Senate seat 
instead.
With the question of the ticket 
out of the way, all eyes were fo
cused on the man Dukakis loves 
to listen to and hates to hear, 
Reverend Jesse Jackson. The
question became What does Jesse 
want? People also asked, Would 
Jesse force a floor fight? Would 
Jesse upstage Mike? Would 
Jesse get a better answering ma
chine?
Surprisingly, the Democratic 
lovefest went off without a hitch. 
It seemed that all Jesse wanted 
was an hour during prime time 
Monday night and the rights to 
sell videotapes of his speech af
terwards. 
The 
Democrats left 
Atlanta 
happy, in 
one piece, 
and bor
ing.
This led 
attention 
finally 
back to
Vice President George Bush. Bush 
had suffered through Spring in 
search of a campaign. Suddenly, 
he had the one thing he had 
searched for during all of 1988, 
the medias interest. And then 
something amazing happened; 01 
George came up with something 
interesting; he wouldnt name his 
Veep choice.
This, of course, soon led to some 
very embarrassing brown-nosing 
by Jack Kemp and Robert Dole in 
the Big Easy. Especially considDave Levy
ering that neither was chosen 
since they both have gray hair.
So George came into New Or
leans, making sure he didnt ar
rive until President Reagan left 
so he wouldnt stand in the old 
mans shadow. He then proceeded 
to blow the best-kept political 
secret since Deep Throat. Bush 
announced his choice of Indiana 
Senator Dan Quayle less than six 
hours after arriving at the con
vention.
We now have a Republican Vice 
Presidential candidate' who is 
known more for his looks than his 
ideas, a conservative Gary Hart, 
who even has a shady woman in 
his past, and perhaps even lust in 
his heart.
Which brings us now to those 
allegations of Quayles dodging 
the Vietnam war for the National 
Guard. Welcome to the 1988 
campaign where ethics matter 
and issues dont. Try to name one 
thing Quayle stands for, then say 
where he was on weekends from 
1969 to 1975.
Thats where we stand at Elec
tion Day minus eight weeks.
This looks to be the closest race 
since 1960, Even NBC News 
hasnt predicted a winner, so it 
looks like we get to watch this one 
together.

wanted one in their room.
So we moved into the first act 
and the beginning scene, audi
ence participation. Usually this 
is the dead silence that precedes 
the rest of the show but this week 
there was a lot to be done. The 
question of vacancies was easily 
put into the background until later 
by Chairperson Erica Levy and 
she then went on to introduce 
Mike Murphy, the new Student 
Ombudsman. Many of the ques
tions were straightforward:
Wheres your office?
The sixth floor of Warner Hall.
Whats your phone number?
Extension 2991 or 2056.
Is it true that you still work 
for Housing?
No, I no longer work there.
He also mentioned that he was 
sending out a letter to each stu
dent that included a business card 
and information about what the 
student ombudsman was sup
posed to do.
After the interrogation of Mr. 
Murphy it was the Presidents 
time to take center stage. Andy 
Robitshek kept the ball rolling by 
talking about the State of the 
University Address that Dr. 
Cyertwillbe givinglaterthisyear. 
Also PSAC will be looking into 
problems at the Tartan Grill. The 
Enthusiasm committee will live 
again this year, under the tute
lage of the chairperson of Senate 
and Natalie Capone. Last but not 
least is my favorite. Andy was

the entire meeting. When asked 
about cable TV, he stated that he 
lives off campus and, Mine's in, 
so there is hope. He gave the 
same answer when asked about 
the computer network.
The IFC rep wasnt talking. Ac
tually he was at the IFC meeting, 
so it was a little difficult to talk to 
Senate.
Dean Cox then took over and 
asked for nominations to the 
various committees for the Board 
of Trustees. After the usual ques
tions inquiring exactly how people 
were picked for the committees, 
nominations were accepted for the 
open positions. TheylJ be doing it 
again tonight if youre interested 
in the committees and the list and 
nominations are in the minutes 
in the News section. The guy in

six seconds. Congratulations to

Speakers Forum Board, asked 
how much funding they had 
($17,000 and petitions for new 
members should be out by the 
time you read this).
Just a short intermission to talk 
about the PSFB. Its a subcom
mittee of Senate. A few groups 
kept bugging Senate for money to 
bring people to campus who were 
considered by some as more po
litically oriented than normal 
speakers. This group was created 
to bring them to campus and keep 
the integrity of Senates fiscal 
policy which states that political 
organizations cannot be funded.

Think about this before you vote
How do you choose the people 
that you vote for? Do you analyze 
their political ideology? Do you 
have a political ideology?
With the November elections 
just two months away, you would 
do yourself a favor by finding out 
where you are on the political 
spectrum. When you do, life be
comes easier. You then vote for 
people that best represent you. 
The hard part is discovering where 
you are and where the candidates 
are.
The two dominant political ide
ologies today are liberal and con
servative. A liberal usually op
poses traditional American val
ues. Consequently, liberals favor 
large government, more govern
ment regulations, higher taxes, 
international peace through ne
gotiation, abortion on demand, 
homosexual rights, an expansion 
of criminal rights, and moral re
lativism.
A conservative, however, usu
ally supports traditional Ameri
can values. Therefore, conserva
tives advocate small government, 
less government regulation, lower 
taxes, international peace 
through military strength, capil tal punishment, making abortion 
illegal, religious freedom at every
Jeff Farto
level of society, and moral abso
lutes.
We can now scale a persons 
ideology based upon where they 
stand on the above issues. Imag
ine a scale running from left to 
right, 0 to 100. A person who 
strongly advocates all liberal 
positions is given a score of 0. On 
the other hand, a person who 
favors all the conservative posi
tions receives a score of 100.
Someone who adopts positions 
from both sides equally receives a 
score of 50  a moderate ideol
ogy. Hence when a person is re
ferred to as left of center, or leftwing, they side with the liberals 
most frequently. Conversely, a 
right-winger agrees with the con
servatives.
Here are some examples of very 
liberal people. All of them score 
below 20: George McGovern, Gary 
Hart, Ted Kennedy, Mike 
Dukakis, Supreme Court Justice 
William Brennan, journalists 
Sam Donaldson and Dan Rather, 
and National Organization for 
Women President Molly Yard.
Now for the conservatives. All 
of these people score above 80: 
Jack Kemp, Jesse Helms, Wil
liam Buckley, Pat Robertson, 
Jerry Falwell, Phyllis Schlafly, 
Chief Supreme Court Justice 
William Rehnquist, and, of course, 
President Reagan.
If the professors at Carnegie 
Mellon were scored and averaged, 
the average would be about 30. 
Some would say I am being gener
ous toward the conservative side 
with that number.
So, if I were you, I wouldnt rely 
on your professors for a balanced 
view of life. Examine the issues 
yourself. Look at the other side. 
Read conservative opinions and 
liberal opinions. Make your deci
sions logically  based on rea
sons, not feelings.
You have listened to Dan Rather 
on the news, but have you ever 
read William Buckleys National 
Review? Be fair to yourself.
Whats your ideological score? 
The average American is undoubt
edly right of center. How else could 
Ronald Reagan have won two 
landslide victories?
You dont have to be right of 
center to be an American, but 
most Americans are right of cen
ter.

lows the Senators to meet each 
other and learn to work together 
better. We can only hope it works.
The Rules committee ended'the 
scene by saying that they will be 
working with Academic Affairs 
on the SAC proposal. Matt Ruben, 
chairperson, also tried to outline 
an agenda including the - AB 
constitution, the Faculty Course 
Evaluations and the new alcohol 
policy. A short note to all, FCEs 
are done by department and'the 
teaching center and used to be 
voluntary. The alcohol policy is 
something else that is also hard 
for Senate to change because it 
happens to be based on law.1
The final scene of the play 
brought ex-senator Tapial 
Mukheijee into a soliloquy where 
he expressed his feelings about 
Rules overstepping its bounds &nd 
entering the domain of the other 
committees. Mr. Ruben replied 
that Rules will work with other 
committees, not against them.
As the curtain closed with' the 
announcements, the audience 
cast a glance at the clock and was 
surprised that less than two hours 
had passed. Nothing like ~!the 
marathon meetings of last yiear 
but then again the show had jnot 
been one of the best either.
Hopefully someday Senate will 
be more of a thriller like All the 
Presidents Men, but for now it 
still reminds me of A Night at 
the Opera.

Jones/Zane 
to appear at 
Pgh. Dance 
Council
By STEPHANIE REEDY
Tartan Staffwriter
The Pittsburgh Dance 
Council will open its 19th 
Fall season with the return 
of Bill T. Jones/Amie Zane 
& Co., on Friday, Septem
ber 16th and will perform 
until Sunday, September 
18th at the Stephen Foster 
Theatre in Oakland. Per
formances on Friday and 
Saturday begin at 8pm and 
there will be a Sunday mati
nee at 1pm.
The Company anticipates 
its return to Pittsburgh as 
the city marks the site of 
the companys 1983 debut 
as a professional company. 
It is also the current home 
for the Companys former 
Executive Director 
Carolelinda Dickey, who 
performed with the Com
pany for more than seven 
years before becoming Ex
ecutive Director for the 
Pittsburgh Dance Council.
The Jones/Zane Company 
has its beginnings in Bing
hamton, New York, where 
Bill Jones, a dancer, actor 
and athlete, met Arnie 
Zane, a photographer. The 
teamup of this unlikely pair 
occurred when Jones con
vinced Zane to study dance, 
and, for eleven years fol
lowing, the two performed 
both separately and to
gether as a strong post
modern duet company.
The J ones/Zane Company 
has been described by The 
New York Times as ele
gant and effervescent, with 
choreography which pro
vides an atmosphere of fer
ment, excitement, and 
partying spirit.
The companys dancers 
possess varied backgrounds 
ranging from athletics and 
actingto classicalhalletand 
Irish step-dancing.
Because of this varied in
dividualism of the dancers, 
the company moved into un
charted territories in an ef
fort to create a new move
ment vocabulary. The group 
is known for its choreo
graphic infusion of energy 
as well as its innovative use 
of partnership, body juxta
position, and dynamic tech
nical virtuosity.
The company has per
formed in England, France, 
Israel, Asia, and across the 
United States, appearing to 
nearly 55,000 people annu
ally. Their performances 
have been widely acclaimed 
by many audiences both 
young and old, conservative 
and avant-garde.
Despite Arnie Zanes 
death from AIDS-related 
lymphoma in March of 
1988, Jones feels a strong 
commitment to carrying out 
Zanes artistic visions and 
will continue working with 
the company.
In addition to the Jones/ 
Zane & Co. performances, 
the Pittsburgh Dance 
Councils Modern Master 
series will include the Pitts
burgh debuts of the Stephen 
Petronio Company October 
7th-9th, and the Adaptors/ 
Movement Theater Decem
ber 2nd-4th. Both groups 
will appear at the Stephen 
Foster Theatre in Oakland. 
Call the Pittsburgh Dance 
Council at 355-0330 for 
more information, and for 
information on subscription 
programs and on any stu
dent discounts available.

MU Drama begins 88 -89 season
By LORI MAURER
; Tartan Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon Drama 
Department will present three 
contrasting works for its 1988-89 
jleason. The works are The Cru
cible by Arthur Miller, a modem 
classic which recounts the Salem 
vitch trials of1692, ALittleNight 
\iusic, a Sondheim musical, and 
Ifenrik Ibsens Peer Gynt, an epic 
ive act dramatic poem. 
Associate Head of the Drama 
)epartment, Don Marinelli, de
scribes the diversity of these 
jwprks as occurring through an 
intersection of concerns of actSng and design elements. Marjiifelli also stresses that these are 
all highly recognizable works, 
ries that we may have read in 
iMgh school, college, or seen in 
'production elsewhere.
The Drama Departments 1988- 
89 season will be the first in which 
th(e shows run for three weeks 
ntead of two, decreasing the 
fiiiimber of productions from the
five of the previous season to three 
in order to increase the word of 
mouth audience. Deciding that 
two weeks was not enough for the 
build of the show, the department 
extended the duration of the 
shows to give students more time 
to see the productions and give 
the actors experience in playing 
one character for a longer period 
of time, allowing them to gain 
greater insight into their role and 
acting in general.
The Crucible, the first produc
tion of the 1988-89 season, will 
run from October 19 to Novem
ber 5. Written by Arthur Miller 
in 1953 as a response to the 
McCarthy era, this play depicts 
the Salem witch trials. Marinelli 
feels that the reaction to the play 
will benefit from the fact that The 
Crucible is required reading in 
all Pittsburgh area high schools. 
The director of the play will be 
Derek Campbell, who formerly 
was the director of the MIT 
Shakespeare Ensemble and who 
is spending the semester as a
guest professor at Carnegie Mel
lon.
The second production of the 
1988-89 season will be A Little 
Night Music, a Sondheim musi
cal which was inspired by the 
Ingmar Bergman film Smiles of a 
Summer Night. It will run from 
February 15 to March 4. A Little 
Night Music was chosen for the 
season because of the popularity 
of Sondheim in Pittsburgh, as 
indicated by Carnegie Mellons 
highly successful Side by Side by 
Sondheim of the 1986 season and 
also due to the fact that there is a 
possibility that it will be revived 
on Broadway this year. Billy 
Wilson, the director of Side by 
Side by Sondheim, a professor of 
dance at Carnegie Mellon and the 
choreographer of such Broadway 
shows as Odyssey with Yul 
Brynner and Stop the World I 
Want to Get Off with Sammy Davis 
Jr., will direct.
The last production of the sea
son will be Henrik Ibsens Peer 
Gynt which Marinelli describes
as the drama departments 
monstrous undertaking of the 
season. It will run from April 19 
to May 6. Marinelli defines the 
play as the closest thing to Disney 
World on stage as the story fol
lows Peer Gynt in his lifetime 
voyage of discovery. Ibsens work 
will also be a wonderful design 
challenge in the recreation of the 
fantastic lands which Peer Gynt 
travels through in his journey.
Peer Gynt will benefit from the 
expertise of drama department 
faculty member Brian Johnston, 
a modem Ibsen critic and scholar 
who, along with Marinelli, was 
involved in the American Ibsen 
Theatre, an undertaking which 
was guided by the social ideals of 
Ibsens work and his common 
theme of exploration of the self. 
The Theatre died after three years 
but in the words of Don Marinelli, 
the dream didnt. There will be 
a symposium on Ibsen and 19th 
century drama which will coin
cide with the production.

Carnegie Mellon and professor at 
Tel Aviv University, will direct 
Peer Gynt. He has also been di
rector of the Habina (the National

directed the critically acclaimed 
Ghost Sonata for the 1982-83 
season of the Carnegie Mellon

J-Man Fu: The Last Temptation of Joe Bob
The problem with movies about 
Jesus is that I already know how 
'they come out. Thats why The 
/ Last Temptation of Christ is so
 great. You never know what this
 wacky guy is gonna do next!
> ;> Okay, okay, okay, most of you 
7 .know by now that I hadnt been
inside a hard-top movie theater 
,since 1967, and that was only to 
/get change for a twenty, but I had 
^to see this one. All my Babtist
 -buddies, all my Pentecostal budr dies, all my friends in the
Citizens for Decency ofTu< 
: pelo, Mississippi, that had 
i.the march on the World 
Headquarters of SevenEleven three years back 
<-rEVERYBODY was in 
</town for the grand open
ing. They decided to sugi *gest that the makers of this movie 
sTiould have their heads blown off 
; in a Christian manner, and they 
. were carrying signs that said stuff 
.rlike My Savior Thinks 
This Movie Has Cooties 
and many other Christian 
\ sentiments, and whenever 
' .theres a protest of that 
.size, it normally means 
-uyoure gonna see at least 
60, 70 nekkid breasts and 
^ somebody's head blown off.
I been using their recom
mendations for years.
So all right, yes, I admit 
it, Im not proud of it, but I 
went INDOORS to see this 
flick. But I know the JMan will forgive me for 
that. Because this is His 
best performance in sev> eral centuries.
; It starts out with Jesus 
j on a bad acid trip. He roots 
; around in the dirt all the
time and hangs out with 
\ talking snakes and faints 
! and twitches a lot and 
! watches Mary Magdalene 
i make the sign of the triple 
j jointed electric eel in a cave full of 
; Iranians. Mary Mag has some 
; body tattoos that make her look 
J like she spent the seventies in a 
| biker gang, and she tries to ma| nipulate the J-Man into marry! ing her by saying she wouldnt 
1 have to be imitating the burrow! ing back-weasel if it wasnt for
 the fact that Jesus is not into 
j marriage. Get a life! she tells 
| Him.
j One thing I like about this Je\ sus, compared to the 11-hour 
\ miniseries Jesus, is that this guy 
! doesnt mess around. He does the
John the Baptist, John looks like 
he just crawled up out of a Good
will box. Hes a crazy old coot 
whos been hanging around the 
Salvation Army office growing 
stuff in his hair. In fact, its Andre! 
Remember the guy from My 
Dinner With Andre? Its him! 
NOBODY will listen to the guy, 
and who can blame em. We had to 
listen to him for two hours al
ready in that other movie.
Anyhow, Jesus makes it out into
I Joe-Bob Goes \ \To The Drive-In
the desert, sits in the dirt some 
more, and Satan sends some zoo 
animals to tempt him. The desert 
is ALWAYS the best place to be

tempted by the devil, which is 
why I personally spend so much 
time in Tucumcari, New Mexico. 
But anyhow, first a snake asks 
him to look at the snakes garbonzas, but a snake dont have 
garbonzas, so that dont work. 
Then a lion tells him hes a liar. 
Then a ball of fire talks with a 
British accent. Jesus eats a big 
old bloody apple, chops down a 
tree, and then he goes to see Mary 
and Martha, who are telling him 
God doesnt want you to fast and 
pray. He wants you to make chilhe rips his heart out of his chest 
and shows it to the disciples, then 
he becomes REAL popular with 
the disciples by turning water into 
wine, and then he tells his mother 
to buzz off  Were staying pretty 
close to scripture at this point  
and then we get to one of my 
personal favorite scenes: Lazarus. 
You know, its not something you 
like to think about, but when 
Jesus did that, Lazarus had al
ready been down in that tomb for 
a couple, three days, and 
.    he was STINKY, besides 
which he looked like Ja
son after hes been killed 
in Friday the 13th Part 
5. Then Saul of Tarsus 
comes along  its Harry 
Dean Stanton, the Repo 
    Man!  and he asks 
Lazarus which was better, alive 
or dead, and Lazarus says There 
wasnt that much difference, and 
so Saul kills him.
And then the rest of it is 
pretty much straight out 
of the Bible until you get to 
the part at the end where 
hes nekkid on the cross, 
trying to figure out SOME 
OTHER WAY for the story 
to end. And then Martin 
Scorsese, the director, 
shows us SOME OTHER 
WAY for it to end. And 
that's the part that my 
buddy Donny Wildman of 
the Citizens For Decency 
says oughta be censored 
offthefaceofthe earth. Its 
where this guardian angel 
that looks like a Valley Girl 
Brat Pack reject with a 
British accent comes and 
gets him off the cross and 
takes him on a picnic and 
reintroduces him to Mary 
Magdalene and they get 
married, and then she dies, 
and then he marries the 
OTHER Mary, of Maryand-Martha fame, only he gets a 
little from Martha on the side, 
and then theres a whole lot of 
that obnoxious Middle Eastern 
flute music, until hes an old man 
dying on his bed and he thinks to 
himself, You know, I think I did 
something wrong here, and then 
Paul and Judas show him that 
little Brat Packer was really the 
devil and he better get his hiney 
back up on the cross where he 
belongs. And so he does. And it IS 
where he belongs. And it IS a 
temptation he probably had. And 
it IS something youd think aboutdren!Asyoucansee,NOWGods ___________=_____________

Lots of stuff happened this 
summer that you missed if you 
went home. Boy, dont you feel 
silly.
The LCB showed its taste in 
music by closing down the 
Squirrel Hill American Legion. 
While the Legion was never a 
full-blown club, it had played 
host to a number of excellent 
bands, both local and not. Nice 
and small, too, and inexpen
sive, as in three bucks 
per show. HoweveT, 
early in the summer, 
they served someone 
they werent supposed 
to, and that was it for 
them. Nobodys ex
actly sure whats going 
to happen.to the Le
gion now, but nothing has hap
pened for at least two months 
and things dont look very good. 
So far, only the Electric Ba
nana and Graffiti have evaded 
the Bust Club. Dont you feel 
safe, knowing that the legions 
of underaged boozers have 
been cut by such a large 
amount?
Membership in the Bust Club 
isnt the only thing causing prob
lems, though. The Decade closed 
its doors last month (without tell
ing the Hickoids, who arrived in 
town from Texas expecting to 
play). While the closing is offi
cially due to financial reasons, its 
more likely due to the fact that 
the very-long-time owner has 
gotten tired of dealing with the 
place. Regardless, the closing kills 
the closest thing to a musical 
legacy this town had.

b! The storyline of the film Be:'mayedi now entering its third 
,e Iweek of release, is purely fictional,
; the work of screenwriter Joe 
U,Eszterhas and director Costa'Savras. Unfortunately, the backI ground of the film is firmly 
grounded in reality.
The film deals with undercover 
agent Cathy Weaver whose asl; signment to investigate the bru11 tal murder of a controversial talk 
how host takes her into Americas
I heartland, and into the life of Gary 
r Simmons; Vietnam War hero,
yridowed father of two, and main 
' spect in the slaying. Working 
is a combine operator, Cathy 
slowly becomes a part of Garys 
world; despite her mission and 
j suspicions about his role in the 
u murder, Cathys personal needs 
c compel her into a deeper involvea| lent with him.
II Cathys involvement with Gary 
31 not only reveals him as a tender 
c and caring lover, but also as a 
 man who is committed to destroy0 ing the ideals and the system she 
j has sworn to protect. Gary is the
leader of a white supremacist 
group whose mission is to rid the 
country of ZOG, the Zionist 
Occupation Government, a group 
which he imagines is to blame for 
, Americas moral decline. As
1 Cathy journeys deeper into the 
Tworld of the racist organization
she must witness and commit acts 
of terrorism to protect her iden
tity and ultimately to establish 
the guilt of the man she loves. 
The group headed by Gary 
immons in the film is patterned 
;er the many extremist organi;ations littered across America, 
^roups with names like The 
Drder, the American Nazis, The 
^ryan Nations, the Posse Comiatus and The Covenant, The 
Sword and the Arm of the Lord 
)perate in a manner not unlike 
;hat depicted in the film. One of 
the most wrenching scenes in the 
picture depicts what the charac
ters refer to as a coon hunt, in 
which a young black man is ab
ducted, stripped and left in the 
wilderness to be hunted down by 
the heavily armed members of 
;he organization. This and other 
incidents of racial violence in this 
ilm are based on actual incidents 
uch as the murder of Michael 
Donald, a 19 year old Alabama 
pouth who was hunted by the 
KK, and the murder of Denver 
alk radio personality Alan Berg 
)y members of the Aryan Na;ions.
Racial violence is not the only 
:ommon thread between reality 
ind fiction in the film. The idea of 
;he Zionist Occupational Govement, as well as the use of com
puter networks in order to facili
tate communications between 
rganizations, and plots ranging 
from the assassination of federal 
^judges and FBI agents to the 
I overthrow of the United States 
\\ Government, are drawn from the 
j modus operandi of existing white 
j supremacist groups, 
j ] Betrayed began three years ago 
, with producer Irwin Winkler, best 
j; known for films such as The Right 
Stuff, JRound Midnight and the 
j .ocky series. While working on a

CONmHHU&
storyline about a woman in con
flict, Winkler came across an L.A. 
Times article on white suprema
cists, which provoked the pro
ducer to gather further research 
on the story. While in France 
overseeing the production of 
3Round Midnight, Winkler was 
introduced to Director CostaGavras, who shared his enthusi
asm for the material and subse
quently accepted his offer to de
velop the film.
Costa-Gavras is best known for 
his intense political thrillers. His 
1969 film Z which dealt with the 
assassination of a member of the 
Greek Parliament won him an 
Academy Award for Best Foreign 
Film. His most recent efforts
include State of Siege and Miss
ing, the story of a distraught North 
American father seeking hins son 
in the midst of a South American 
coup. Although Missing provoked 
a great deal of controversy due to 
its portrayal of the State Depart
ment, the storys center lay in the 
conflicts within the characters. 
According to Gavras, the same is
true of Betrayed. In Betrayed the 
thriller aspect is not in seeing 
whether the killer will be caught 
but seeing what will happen to 
this woman who is struggling to 
find herself.
For the demanding role of Cathy 
Weaver, Gavras and Winkler 
chose two time Academy Award 
winner Debra Winger (Terms of 
Endearment, Urban Cowboy). 
Gavras explains his choice by 
stating that  ...we wanted not 
only a beautiful girl, but a great 
actress, someone who had the 
range to play the character of 
Cathy in so many different and 
often difficult situations. 
Academy Award nominee Tom 
Berenger plays the role of Gary 
Simmons. In films such as Pla
toon (for which he received a 
Golden Globe Award for Best 
Supporting Actor), The Big Chill 
and Someone To Watch Over Me, 
Berenger has excelled in playing 
both strong sensitive characters 
as well as ones with a frightening 
dark side. Berengers versatility 
makes him the perfect choice for 
the role of a character requiring a 
solid mix of strength and sensi
tivity contrasted with a hard,
bitter edge.
Rounding out the cast are John 
Heard, who was most recently 
seen as Tom Hanks corporate 
rival in Big and as a reluctant 
lawyer in Robert Redfords The 
MilagroBeanfieldWar, and John 
Mahoney, whose film credits 
include Moonstruck and the up
coming John Sayles film Eight 
Men Out. Making their big screen 
debuts are Brian Bosek and Mafia 
Valdez, who play Gary Simmons 
children.
In presenting a story of extreme 
hatred, bigotry and violence With 
a tense blend of personal conflict 
and realistic detail, Betrayed 
stands to become one of the most 
important films of the year. By 
virtue of an outstanding cast 
under the guidance of a master 
director it also promises to .'be
come one of the most acclaimed 
and artistically satisfying films 
to be seen on American screens in 
recent memory.
Betrayed, directed by CostaGavras, starring Tom Berenger 
and Debra Winger. Produced by 
IrwinWinkler. Showing in Squir
rel Hill at the Squirrel Hill Thea
ter on Forward Avenue.

This man has been seen recently in Innerspace

Quaid is a New Orleans homicide detective who 
has to come to grips with the casual, almost 
businesslike corruption in his department. Ellen 
Barkin portrays the DA who turns his depart

investigates reports of drug dealing and cops on

Oh, yes. If you havent seen it, see it. If you have

perhaps the best Arnold movie of all time. Simply 
by virtue of Arnies co-starRichard Dawson, for 
Heavens sake  youd think this movie would be 
good. Wrong. Its great. Fantabulous. Arnie wears 
Spandex, commits assault with a chainsaw, plans 
a revolution with Mick Fleetwood, trades smallarms fire with half the cast of The Road Warrior, 
bends, breaks and mutilates things and all in all 
makes a bother of himself. Its Max Headroom

More Arnold! In this particular film, Arnie is

 The best part is the looks you get from the people 
alking by, laughed Phi Kappa Theta President 
ave Hersh. He spoke from experience  he camped 
mit by the fence for five days and four nights last 
peek.
IS Traditionally, Phi Kap has guarded the fence for a 
week prior to its annual Beach Party. But this year, 
Hersh figured a one week monopoly of the fence didnt 
*do enough honor to his fraternitys pre-rush blowout. 
So he convinced Vice President Ed Bockman to join 
ftiim for a week of fun on the Cut.
 Its Late Night with Dave and Ed, chuckled 
Bockman. Were loving it. Fortunately, Hersh and 
Bockman had very few overlapping classes, so one 
feas almost always on guard. They ate meals brought 
to them by Phi Kap brothers.
Unwritten but strict rules dictate that the fence can 
(inly be painted at night. The organization that paints 
it must stand guard all night long to assure that 
feobody disturbs the paint job before morning. Tradi
tion further mandates that anyone who owns the 
fence for more than one night must entirely repaint it 
very night.
 Although Hersh and Bockman were responsible for 
guarding the fence, brothers from Phi Kap turned out 
=[ach night to help recoat it. During the day, the two

Fraternities, sororities target freshmen

dorm storming, rush lasts until the 
end of the month.
Heres how it works: a prospective 
rushee checks out the frats and so
rorities and usually finds one or two 
he or she feels comfortable with. 
Through the various parties and 
events sponsored by the houses, the 
members and the rushees get to know 
each other. By a majority vote, a bid, 
or offer, to join may or may not be 
given. The rushee can then decide 
whether or not to pledge.
Most students have taken advan
tage of the wet rush parties, although 
Mark Patrick, a current Theta Xi 
pledge, says that a better idea of Greek
life is offered in the dry events spon
sored throughout the week. Its not 
just parties, its a brotherhood. If 
anybody is even remotely considering 
joining the Greek system, they should 
check it out. We dont pressure them 
to do stuff.
Kappa Sigma brother David Gantshar agrees. At Kappa Sigma we have 
a lot of exciting rush events planned 
over the next couple of weeks. They 
include football, movie and bowling 
nightsWere also expecting a great 
pledge class. All of our events so far 
have had great turnouts this year. 
The main reason for rushing seems

Walking across campus one cant 
help but notice the throng of people 
hanging out in front of the fence, 
blaring R.E.M. and playing ultimate 
frisbee. Painted on our campus land
mark are the letters for all of the frats 
and sororities; such unity is a rare 
occurrence. The cause is Rush 88. 
They have all gathered together to 
encourage students to go Greek.
To many of us, the Greek system 
itself is a mystery. Rush offers an 
opportunity to find out more about it.

SAI gathers to 
watch sister 
on national TV
By DEBORAH J. SAX
Tartan Staffwriter
Success!! That was the theme of this 
years Miss America Pageant, which was 
broadcast live this Saturday evening at ten 
oclock pm. Earlier Saturday evening the 
members of Sigma Alpha Iota (SAI), Carnegie 
Mellons honorary womens music fraternity, 
gathered in President Mitzi Huffs home to 
watch the pageant.
Although SAIs members usually see the 
pageant, this years show was a special one. 
Tonight, SAI member Denise Meyer, a voice 
major at CMU, would represent Pennsylva- 
nia. SAI members were crossing their fingers^ 
in the hopes that Denise would be chosen to ' 
reign as Miss America for 1989. j
Fifty other Misss were competing with ^ 
Denise for the chance to be crowned as Miss 
America. The lucky young woman would win 
more than just a crown: over $130,000.00 was 
at stake, as well as the chance to compete for 
the title of Miss Universe early next year.
The sisters of SAI had high hopes for 
Denise, and had gathered together to support 
her. Together, they would be there, to bite 
their nails or clap their hands or shed tears 
for their sister.
Michelle Dawson, a member of SAI and a 
close friend of Denise, could relate to Denises 
feelings more than anyone else. Two years

Denise Meyer
Senior voice mEyor Denise Meyer has 
been missing a few classes. Thats not 
all that remarkable for a CMU student; 
whats different about Meyer is that 
shes Miss Pennsylvania.
Meyer became interested in the Miss 
Pennsylvania pageant after talking with 
a few other girls who had entered 
similar pageants. One of these girls was 
Michelle Dawson, a former Miss Ver
mont and also a CMU student. Two 
years ago, Meyer entered and won the 
Miss Allegheny County pageant. She 
then proceeded to the Miss Pennsylva
nia pageant. Although she was one of
ten semi-finalists, she didnt win the 
crown. This year, she won the Miss 
Bedford County pageant and proceeded 
to capture the state title.

Committee for Alcohol 
and Drug Education 
provides Informal help
By KELLY SPENCER
Tartan Staffwriter
Theres a new service coming to 
campus. In association with Gate
way Rehabilitation Center, Car
negie Mellons Health Center and 
Division of Student Affairs are 
jointly sponsoring the Committee 
for Alcohol and Drug Education 
(CADE).
I Unlike current campus services 
feuch as the Counseling Center 
and its crisis hotline, CADE pro
vides an informal setting in which 
students can discuss concerns 
{iomfortably with a peer. Such a 
(relaxed atmosphere offers an al
ternative to more formal and of
ten more threatening professional 
therapy. Although its members 
are not certified, faculty and stujlent volunteers undergo an in
tensive six to eight hour training 
Session prior to their commitment. 
'These sessions emphasize strong 
listening skills and abuse aware
ness, preparing volunteers well 
tbr the experience ahead, 
rAlthough still in the planning 
stages, a recent government grant 
has allowed CADE volunteers to 
fvork quickly in developing the
service. Ultimately, the group 
hopes to offer a type of appoint
ment by phone service in which 
students can call in to request a 
convenient peer conference.
CADE operates on the belief 
that sometimes just talking with 
a peer can help immensely, either 
instead of or in preparation for 
formal therapy. Consistent with 
this belief, the group will refer 
students to professional counsel
ors if requested, but as volun
teers stress, such referral is not 
mandatory, only available. The 
members are concerned students, 
not administration officials.
Students can call us with their 
own problems or those of a close 
friend, says Student Senate vol
unteer Karen Pavlosky. A typi
cal question might be someone 
worried about a normally sober 
friends excessive weekend drink
ing habits. The person might be 
wondering if weekend drinking is 
merely social or if it could possi
bly be a sign of alcoholism.
More information on CADEs 
services will be posted on campus 
as well as in future Tartans. For 
volunteer information, contact 
Pavlosky at x4612.

Dear Specs,
My roommate wears tie dyes, 
sandals and a mystic crystal 
around her neck that she bought 
at a Dead show. All her friends 
dress in a similar fashion and 
they dont cut their hair very 
frequently. When theyre all in 
our room I feel like spraying 
Raid.
I think Im going crazy. On 
top of this, my roommate thinks 
that Jim Morrison is still alive. 
She can think what she wants, 
but I cant stand the dirty fleabitten look. What should I do?
P.P.
Dear P.P.,
Dressing like youve just 
hopped off the bus from Woodstock is very in this year. Un
less you become victimized by 
her taste, she has every right to 
wear what she wants, just as 
she has a right to think what 
she wants.
However, if her tie dyes ruin 
your clothes in the wash, insist 
she use Woolite. If her friends 
do bong hits in a frenzy of reliv
ing the 60s, call the police. Oth
erwise, just relax and pretend 
youre living with your mother

Dear Specs,
Im a freshman and Im having 
trouble figuring out whats fash
ionable at CMU. Any tips?
Fall Finds
Dear Fall,
Look to the seniors for an ex
ample. While some model the 
Carnegie Mellon classic  orien
tation t-shirt, jeans and a Mac  
others are more adventurous.
A good trend for men seems to 
be matching the color of ones 
socks with that of ones sweater. 
It takes time to get the hang of it, 
but its quite a sharp look, and 
drives girls wild. Unfortunately, 
pants worn at flood level are out 
this year, so your match can only 
be appreciated when you sit or re
cline. This means you must cross
your legs whenever you see an 
attractive female, so that shell 
notice. Since it looks silly to con
stantly sit down in the middle of 
the Cut so that people see your 
socks, be prepared to spend a lot 
of time in the library. Taking this 
fashion risk will pay off in the 
end.
Ifyoure a female, invest in black 
bikers shorts. You can make a 
pair by cutting the legs off of your 
aerobics pants from last year. 
Wear these shorts with every
thing. Under dresses, minis, Ber
muda shorts  even by them
selves theyre quite a fashion 
statement. Worn with just a tshirt, they have that I just fin
ished a triathalon feeling. Worn 
under a dress, they update the 
transformation look from Cinder
ella to Flashdance.
Unless you weigh 100 pounds, 
though, youd better stick to 
wearing them only inside Morewood. Otherwise, someone might 
think youre heading over to 
Morrisons for a Weight Watchers 
meeting.
S
Dear Specs,
I want to get my boyfriend some
thing nice to wear, but I dont 
know what hed like. Any sug
gestions?
Hopefully Devoted 
Dear Hope,
Dont get him what hed like, 
just buy him a tie. If he wears 
it, you will have done the com
munity a service.

Dear Specs,
Whats the best thing to wear 
when asking someone for a 
date? I want to increase my 
chance of getting a yes reply.
Nervous
Dear Nervous,
It doesnt matter what you 
wear as long as she knows you 
plan to take American Express, 
Visa, and Mastercard along. It 
also helps not to wear food in 
your teeth, dirty toes with flip 
flops, a pocket protector and 
pens, synthetic fibers, or 3 hairs 
attempting to form a mous
tache on your upper lip.
The only other recommenda
tion I have is semper ubi sub

means: always wear under
wear.

The girls waited nervously for 
the hosts Gary and Mary Anne 
Collins to announce the 10 
finalists. Miss Florida, North 
Dakota, Mississippi, California, 
Minnesota, Hawaii, Oklahoma, 
Louisiana, Alabama, and Miss 
Colorado.
Although she had done her 
best, Denise Meyer was no 
longer in the competition. But 
the evening was far from over. 
The 27 members of the music 
fraternity are talented young 
women themselves, and served 
as good critics for the 
young women on the 
stage. Each watched 
carefully, chosing her 
own candidate for the 
title.
The job of choosing 
just one of the fiftyone contestants was 
given to a panel of 
well-known judges, 
including Dr. Joyce 
Brothers and recent 
graduate of CMU and 
LA. Law star Blair 
Underwood. The ten 
finalists scores would 
be based on the 
following: 40% talent, 
40% evening gown 
and personality, and 
20% swimsuit compe
tition.
Each contestant 
was required to 
display talent in a
performance of her choice. In 
the evening gown/personality 
competition, each contestant 
had to display poise in her gown 
as well as answer a question 
about current affairs. In addi
tion, each contestant competed 
in the swimsuit competition. 
Prior to the evening of competi
tion, all 51 contestants had 
spent three days in preliminary 
competition. In addition, the 
contestants had been preparing 
for the competition for the past 
7 months.
Following the two hours of 
competition, reigning Miss Kay 
Lani Rae Rafko prepared to give 
up her crown. The 10 young 
women could now relax as the 
scores were being tabulated.

Im very excited, said Meyer. Its a once in a 
ifetime opportunity.
Being a Miss America contestant isnt all 
[lamor and glory, though. Much time is spent in 
reparation for the talent and interview competiions in addition to activities like wardrobe 
ilanning. Meyer was at work from 7 am to well 
ifter 10 pm. However, she wouldnt have missed 
he pageant experience for anything.
It was a chance to showcase my talents and 
>ossibly win some scholarship money.
As Miss Pennsylvania, Meyer will spend the 
lext year traveling around the state. Because of 
his, she will not be able to return to CMU until 
lext fall. I really miss everyone, she says. 
Meyers future plans include finishing her 
undergraduate education, possibly entering 
5UPA for the masters program in Management 
md Public Policy, and becoming an entertainer.

how we define the term, it is 
implicated in what we do with

For years now scholars have

have the answer. What we do 
have is a few cogent points that 
we have borrowed from scholars 
to start the discussion.
Brian V. Street tells us that 
there are two models for approach
ing computer literacy: one is au
tonomous, the 
other ideologi
cal. The autono
mous model ar
gues that com
puter literacy is 
a basic set of
_______ _ skills that will
guarantee eco
nomic, social and cognitive im
provement. The ideological model 
argues that what literacy means 
is always already (as the cul
tural critics say) determined by 
the social context in which it 
appears  in other words, how 
computing is taught determines 
what it means to be computer 
literate. If the latter is the case, 
and historical evidence suggests 
that it is, then we can make 
computer literacy whatever we

users in the Mellon College of want. So lets decide.
Science. And even within the colRichard Reinoeh, Linda Iroff, 
needs may vary from deand Ann McLennan propose a 
partment to department. We template for defining computer 
obviously need extensive feedback literacy in a way appropriate to 
from the computing community if higher education, a template that 
we are to dovetail our services to operates out of the ideological
these academic needs.
Although our role is to meet the 
users needs  and not to decide 
what these needs are  we can at 
least initiate the discussion and 
provide an avenue for it to take 
place. To this end, we want to
model. They begin with the prem
ises that computer literacy is 
defined in the context of its appli
cation, and that different levels of 
literacy can exist. (Traditional 
literacy also has these different 
levels, from the functional literacy defined by the Census Bu
reau to the critical literacy de
fined by institutions of higher 
education.)
The template these scholars 
offer for discussion is a nine cell 
grid in which computer knowl
edge moves along the vertical axis 
and domain knowledge moves 
along the horizontal axis. The 
three levels of literacy that the 
template addresses move along 
both the vertical and horizontal 
axes: beginning awareness, 
proficiency in theme, and crea
tive development in theory or
practice.
This grid enables us to recog
nize users as, for example, having 
beginning awareness of comput
ing, but exercising creative devel
opment in their academic domain 
 which would place them in the 
bottom right cell on the grid. The 
authors argue that computer lit
eracy begins when users are pro
ficient with computers and profi
cient in their academic domain.
The argument is a template 
rather than a definition because 
it leaves the decision about what 
constitutes proficiency up to the
experts in each 
academic disci
pline. What this 
template does im
ply, however, is that 
computing should 
be well integrated 
into the teaching of 
any academic sub
ject. Faculty mem
bers have to be com
puter literate in 
their field. The 
authors argue that 
the least integrated 
approach to com
puting is to follow 
the autonomous 
model and create a 
generalized com
puter literacy class 
required for incom
ing freshmen. Food 
for thought.
Now that I have 
you thinking, I 
want to know how 
you respond. To 
continue this dis
cussion (which has 
been rather one
sided), you may 
send mail to me in 
3020 Hamburg 
Hall, e-mail to 
troll+@andrew, call 
me at extension 
5163, or subscribe to Academic 
Computings academic.literacy 
bulletin board on Andrew.
The introductory post on 
academic.literacy cites a file that 
can be inserted into a SendMessage window or appended 
to a VXJI Message Entry screen to 
evaluate the current state of 
computer literacy at Carnegie 
Mellon. The same questions about 
computer literacy also appear at 
the end of the UTM evaluation. 
Data from these evaluations will 
be analyzed and presented to 
users as a basis for further dis
cussion. Everyone  student^, 
faculty, and staff  is invited tjo 
subscribe to the academic, literacjy 
bboard and participate in what 
may well be an intellectual fra
cas.
As another contribution to this 
discussion, University Studies 
and Academic Computing ai 
offering an academic course ifi 
the spring called Technology anfr 
Literacy. The course will exam
ine the role of technology anti 
ideology in defining and distrib
uting literacy throughout history. 
Students will get hands-on expe
rience with ancient and medieval 
technologies, and every exercis^ 
they do with these technologies 
they will also do with the com
puter.
Using a Macintosh and Andrew, 
students will record comparative 
data about the different technolo
gies,. statistically analyze this 
data, and use it as the basis for  
critical paper on the history cjf 
literacies in the Western worlcj. 
The class will participate in the 
activity on the academic.literacy 
bboard, and draw salient points 
from it into class discussion anil 
into their final papers. (Unfortu
nately, the class will be limited tb 
18 students.)
Note that Academic 
Computings agenda with thib 
discussion does not encompass 
deciding the criteria for computer 
literacy in the different academic 
disciplines, but rather building 
an infra-structure for integrating 
their services with what depart
ments and colleges in the univer
sity are doing.
We hope that this long-term 
goal makes users optimistic about 
what were doing to meet their 
needs.
We urge you to send comments 
to troll+@andrew, and of coursfe 
to join the conversation op 
academic.literacy.

Fast Food investigates chicken with a side salad
{ For those of you who didnt tune 
in last week, this column is a 
qiiick-cheap-easy-recipe to keep 
students with kitchens from dying 
of boredom at dinner time.
Boneless chicken breasts are 
one of those neat, versatile (albeit 
not quite as cheap as spaghetti) 
food items. Chickens only draw
back is that it cant be cooked 
easily in a hot-pot, but well for
give it for now.
4.
Chicken
* Never thaw or marinate chicken 
outside the refrigerator, because 
harmful bacteria thrive at room 
temperature. Chicken should be 
cooked between 300 and 350 
degrees. Be sure it is fully cooked 
before serving. It is fully cooked if 
t|ie juices run clear when the 
chicken is pierced with a fork.
Ginger Chicken
|Marinate the chicken breasts 
in soy sauce and slivered ginger 
root before baking.
Most supermarkets around here 
carry fresh ginger root in their 
produce section. If theyre out of 
it, you can almost guarantee find
ing it in one of the local Asian 
groceries (try the Pan-Asian on 
Atwood Street). Ginger root gets 
moldy fairly quickly, even in the 
refrigerator, so the best place to
keep it is in the freezer. It is easy 
to peel and slice while frozen, but 
it thaws quickly, and freezing
doesnt affect the taste or texture.
Chicken Parmesan
Dip raw chicken in beaten egg 
and then in bread crumbs mixed 
with basil, oregano, rosemary, 
nutmeg, and thyme. Sautee the 
breaded breasts in olive oil until 
fully cooked. Top with tomato 
sauce and grated mozzarella and 
bake at 300 until the cheese 
bubbles.
Chicken Nuggets
Dice (cut into two-inch cubes). 
Dip in beaten egg and then in 
bread crumbs with salt, pepper, 
and tarragon. Sautee in olive oil 
until browned. Serve with your 
choice of sauce.
Chicken Rolls
Spread raw hamburger or stuff
ing along raw chicken breasts and 
roll up. Top with gravy or tomato 
sauce and bake.
Glazed Orange Chicken
Marinate in orange juice con
centrate, minced 
garlic, tarragon, 
and onion. Baste 
with the orange 
concentrate mix
ture as it bakes.
Pineapple or grape
fruit juice concen
trates also make 
good marinade 
bases.
Side Salad
A nice side dish, 
which is best pre
pared ahead of 
time, is a salad 
made with roasted 
bell peppers. Green 
peppers are the 
least expensive; 
other colors, such as 
red, orange, yellow, 
or purple can be out
rageously expen
sive, which is a 
shame because they 
look so nice. If you decide to 
splurge, however, they range from 
least sweet to most sweet in this 
order: purple, green, red, orange,
yellow.
To roast peppers, wash and broil 
directly under the flame or heat
ing element until almost thor
oughly blackened. Those of you 
who have read The World Accord
ing To Garp may remember that 
Garp blackened the peppers di
rectly on a stove burner, but that 
method makes more of a mess.
Remove the peppers carefully 
with tongs. Wrap them in paper 
towels and place in 
a plastic bag. Seal 
the bag and let 
them sit for ten to 
twenty minutes. 
With a sharp knife, 
peel the thin outer 
skin from the pep
pers and core 
them.
Slice the peppers 
into thin strips and 
marinate with ol
ive oil, cider vine
gar or lemon juice, 
sugar, oregano, 
basil, onion, tarra
gon, and ground 
pepper.
If you like, you 
can add diced tofu, 
mushrooms, cu
cumbers, or other 
vegetables which 
marinate well.

why he was rushing, sopho

Sorority rush is pretty simi

dollars is charged, and one 
must register to rush, unlike 
the less-structured fraternity 
rushing. Luisa, a freshman 
rushee, said she registered 
because I want to see how it 
is, learn more about the Greek 
system.
Andrea Boyer, a sophomore, 
pointed out the benefits of 
such support for someone 
whos away from home. She 
feels that Greek life is a good 
way to get involved at CMU. 
It seems to be a big part of the 
social life here.

Freshman OB throws four touchdown passesTartans whip Washington, 48-17
Graf vs. Lendl 
phy Not?
In addition to setting tennis 
istory last Saturday when she 
beat Gabriela Sabatini in the U.S. 
Open, thus winning the Grand 
(lam, Steffi Graf made a very 
important statement about 
romen athletes.
The match itself was one of the
_iost exciting and most brilliantly
played contests I have ever wit
nessed. It certainly rivaled any 
one of the Navratalova/Evert 
(Lloyd) matches in terms of tech
nique and emotion. In fact, since 
Graf and Sabatini are also doubles 
partners on occasion, their rivalry 
could be the flame to burn on into 
the 1990s if everheaven forbid 
 either Martina or Chris retire 
from competition.
This relationship, both on and 
off court, of Navratalova and Evert 
has always served as a source of 
the Up Close, and Personal 
material used by the broadcasters 
and commentators of the matches. 
Ultimately though, no matter how 
much the two are compared in 
terms of serve, volley, form or 
j overall ability, the fact emerges 
that they are, and hopefully 
always will be, considered two of 
the greatest players of all time.
I use the word player and not 
omen players or even female 
athletes because I feel that 
athletes like Navratalova, Evert, 
Graf and Sabatini do not need to 
be distinguished or set apart from 
men who compete in the same 
sport.
; Ultimately, Jimmy Conners is 
a tennis player, as well are people 
like Ivan Lendl and John 
McEnroe. Why should women be 
considered Great Women 
Players, while the men are given 
the all encompassing title of 
Great Players?
I As I watched Womens Finals 
last weekend, I could not help but 
be amazed by the physical prowess 
of both Sabatini and Graf. 
Sabatini hit four aces in the 
match; shots so powerful that 
McEnroe, on a good day, would 
have as much trouble with as Graf 
had. Likewise, Graf was able to 
make the ball do anything she 
wanted and go anywhere on the 
court as fast or as slow as 
cessary.
The commentators criticized 
ibatini for not being as in good a 
shape as Graf was. I admit that 
; while I know the game and follow 
it closely, I am not an expert.
; Still, if I were able to move and hit 
as quickly and as strongly as 
Gabriela did in the match, I would 
not worry too much about an extra 
'der of O fries with dinner. 
Graf is simply the best, that is 
why she won. After all, she has 
won 34 matches in a row and lost 
only 2 sets in all four of the Grand 
Slam tournaments this year (one 
to N avratalova at Wimbeldon, the 
| other to Sabatini in this match).
, With statistics like this, I wonder 
what a match with Lendl would 
be like for Steffi.
j When Billie Jean King played 
Bobby Riggs in the Battle of the 
(5?xes, it was a joke of a match. It 
was not a tennis match as much 
as it was a television show. It only 
proved that King was great and 
that Riggs was an old, outclassed
! No, I would love to see the Steffi 
Gjjaf/Ivan Lendl match. Not to 
| PJpve who the better player is, 
nPt even to win a bet, but simply 
to watch the two best players in 
the world compete.
Perhaps Martina and Chris 
could team up to take on McEnroe 
and Conners in doubles the same

Never be too confident about 
any match appears to be the 
popular analysis by the womens 
tennis team for last Wednesdays 
5-4 loss against -Duquesne 
University. Much like Thiel 
University in football (a team 
booked for virtually every 
Presidents Athletic Conference 
Homecoming game this season), 
Duquesne has traditionally been 
a quick, painless, and easy victory 
for the Lady Tartans; a win which 
usually gets the season off to a 
good start.
What happened? Four strong 
new Duquesne freshmen is what 
happened. They were tough and 
I think [we] underestimated 
them, explained first year coach 
Julie Babler.
The team needs to be more 
aggressive, she said. We need a 
lot of work on doubles because 
they got real tentative and tight. 
We let the other girls take control. 
You just cant do that. You would 
rather lose hitting out and playing 
your best than being tentative 
and afraid to hit the ball.
After wins by Suzy Dottor, Tracy 
Boyd, and Sohee Chungin singles, 
the match was tied 3-3. Going 
into the doubles matches, 
Carnegie Mellon needed two wins.
To the Tartans disappointment, 
, only the #3 doubles team of Alice 
Garber and Maya Sternberg was 
able to beat their Duquesne rival.
The big surprise of the day came 
from Beth Cavanaugh losing at 
both #2 singles (7-5, 6-1) and the 
#1 doubles (6-4, 3-6, 6-2). 
According to Cavanaugh, who did 
not lose one set of regular season 
tennis last season, The girl I 
played was really good. She was a 
left-handed western grip player 
which meant a lot of top spin and
a lot of hard hitting.
Coach Babler further explained, 
[Cavanaugh] was playing a lot of 
balls way back at the fence. I was 
trying to get her to move in a little 
to take them out of the air and 
break up the pace.
Both coach and teammates 
agree, however, that the loss 
really came down to the teams 
performance in the doubles 
matches. The most important 
thingis what we had been working 
on so far. We hadnt really 
concentrated on doubles.
Not surprisingly, Coach Babler 
spent most of last week refining 
the teams weaknesses at doubles.
I want to make then team more 
familiar with coming to the net, 
an enthusiastic Babler noted. zAr** 
lot of our players will serve and & 
then stay back [in situations] g 
where you want to move up to the jj 
net. The angles are so much more |* 
there for you at the net than at  
the baseline.
The team is quite enthusiastic  
about their prospects this year. 
Coach Babler has introduced more  
conditioning into their practice.  
We might not have an undefeated-- 
season, Cavanaugh concluded, 
but we will certainly have 
endurance by the time of the PAC 
Championship.
Tartan Tennis Liners  
Newcomer to the team, 
Sophomore Colleen Sims, won her 
first match 6-3,6-4 playing at the 
exhibition #7 spot... Tentatively 
this years line-up has been set 
as: Suzy Dottor at #1, Beth 
Cavanaugh at #2, Mary Beth 
Ashbaugh at #3, Alice Garber at 
#4, Tracy Boyd at #5, and Sohee 
Chung at #6 ... Boyd and Chung 
may switch positions as the season 
progresses. The Lady Tartans will 
host Indiana University of 
Pennsylvania at September 15 at 
3:30 pm.
ST. LOUIS-I hope a game like 
this can show our kids how enjoy
able a game can be, remarked 
Tartan Head Coach Lackner. That 
was the coachs reaction after 
Carnegie Mellons (2-0, 1-0 Uni
versity Athletic Association) 48- 
17 victory over Washington Uni
versity (0-1, 0-1).
After a shaky first half, CMU 
out-scored the Bears 27-3 over 
final thirty minutes to break 
Washingtons back. Once again, 
the Tartans marched the ball up 
and down the field, racking up 
over 300 yards on the ground. 
Four runners: Andrew Pizzuro, 
Chris Hansen, Scott Bamyak, and 
Robert Paterson all gained more 
than 50 yards. The freshman 
Pizzuro led all runners with 69 
yards and two touchdowns.
The passing game was also ef
fective. Freshman quarterback 
Steve Patemo was nine of 14 for 
215 yards, four touchdowns and 
two interceptions. Patemos first 
two passes found Mike Beresford 
for touchdowns. You couldnt 
have asked for a start like that, 
admitted Patemo.
The winning score came mid
way through the second quarter. 
After bringing the ball upfield on 
the ground, the drive almost 
stalled when a holding call left 
the Tartans at third and 18,' but 
Patemo was able to find fellow 
freshman Pizurro for a 22 yard 
completion to keep the drive going. 
Patemo then found Barnyak for 
the touchdown score, raising the 
tally to 21-7:
After the Bears first drive of 
the second half stalled, Carnegie 
Mellon got back to work. Paterno 
found his first-half partner Ber
esford for a 17 yard completion to

21-14.bring CMU into scoring position. 
Five plays later Pizurro broke 
through the middle of the line for 
an 18 yard touchdown run.
Washington then mounted a 
drive that ended in a field goal, 
their last score of the day and the 
Tartans got back to work. An
other big play, a 38 yard strike 
from Patemo to Barnyak  the 
freshmans fourth touchdown 
pass of the game  took the CMU 
lead to 35-21.
The fourth quarter brought two 
more Carnegie Mellon scores. 
Laszlo Budas one yard bootleg 
run and Andrew Pizzuros second 
touchdown, a 31 yard scamper 
down the left sideline rounded 
out the Tartan scoring.
All told, Carnegie Mellon held
the Bears to six second-half first 
downs and 113 yards of offense. 
At the end of the game, everyone 
who had made the trip, except for 
the injured Tom Denmeade had 
seen some action on the grass of 
Francis Field.
The Tartans got onto the score
board early. After two runs from 
scrimmge, Paterno found Ber
esford on the right sideline. Ber
esford broke to the middle and 
carried the ball down the length 
of the field to put CMU on top, 7- 
0.
After Washingtons first pos
session, the same combination 
would go to. work again. Seven 
runs brought the Tartans from 
their own 40 to the Bear 7. Patemo 
then found Beresford in the end
zone for a 14-0 lead.
Carnegie Mellon turnovers, 
though, would allow Washington 
to get back into the game. After 
an unsuccessful Bear drive, Todd 
Ramsey picked off a Patemo pass 
to set up Washington near 
midfield. Bear quarterback Ron 
Kingfound pre-season All-Ameri
can tight end Paul Matthews 
alone upfield. Matthews was fi
nally brought down at the CMU 
16. Six plays later, Washington 
was on the board, this cut the lead 
to 14-7.
Later in the period, Doug Storm 
picked off a second Patemo pass 
and returned the ball to the Car
negie Mellon 32. Three plays later, 
William Heard carried the ball in 
from the eight to make the score
Next Week: The Tartans 
turn to Pittsburgh to take on 
Chicago Maroons (0-1, 0-1) at 
South High Stadium. This is the 
first time these two teams will 
meet on the gridiron. The Ma
roons lost last week to UAA rival 
Rochester, 28-14 in Rochester.
The Maroons have 18 starters 
back from last seasons 5-3 team, 
but a new head coach in Rich 
Parrinello. Chicago should be led 
offensively by returning quarter
back Scott Gross and tailback 
Brian Blitz. The game starts at 
2:00 pm; buses will run from Skibo 
to South High Stadium starting 
at 12:00 pm. The game will be 
broadcast on WRCT (88.3-FM) 
starting at 1:50 pm.

NFL Preview: Steelers to finish in ! 
AFC cellar, Browns to top division!
By DAVE BRILL
Tartan Staffwriter
The first in a series previewing 
this years NFL. This week, the 
American Football Conference 
(AFC) Central Division.
Cleveland Browns: The three 
time defending Central Division 
champs and two time AFC runnerup s to Denver, had arguably the 
best quarterback in the AFC in 
Bemie Kosar, until he hurt his 
elbow last week. However, their 
offense is still a viable force due to 
players like Kevin 
Mack and Earnest 
Byner. Cleveland 
has a lot of 
confidence in their 
11-year veteran 
back-up QB Gary 
Danielson.
Cleveland also 
has a superior 
defense led by 
cornerbacks 
Frank Minnifield 
and Hanford 
Dixon. In this years NFL Draft, 
the Browns used their first three 
picks to get defensive linemen to 
help boost their pass rush. If any 
of these rookies can contribute to 
the teams defensive play, the 
Browns will be tough to beat. 
Cleveland will win the AFC 
Central again. How far they go 
after that, will depend on their 
defense.
Houston Oilers: As last years 
Central Division runner-up, the 
Oilers made the play-offs as a
wild card team. After beating the NFL last year.

!; The first Intramural Board 
! meeting of the year was held last 
'Thursday afternoon. In this
 meeting plans were made for the 
' Sports In Season as well as the 
ISports Coming Up, in the next 
few weeks.
One of the biggest issues at the 
leeting was the subject of the 
Ifficials Club.
Assistant IM Director Mike 
lastroianni, who oversees the 
Jub, stated that he wants to make 
lure that everyone involved with 
M understands what the purpose 
md duties of game officials are. 
Any one can join the club whose 
jrimaiy purpose is to provide 
ifficials for IM games in order to 
teep the rules enforced, the games 
iafe and to make sure all events 
ire well organized.
Some people were a little 
jonfused about whether or not 
they could play a sport and also 
officiate. They can, said 
Mastroianni. In football for 
Example, a person could officiate 
a 4:30 game, then play on their 
'iiiwn team at 5:30 or 6:30.
Mastroianni added, We hope 
to get people in the officials club 
that enjoy the sport. As and added 
incentive, all officials get paid 
$4.00 per game which comes out 
of the IM budget.
For football, the club plans to 
provide 2 officials for each game 
and 3 officials for the play-offs 
and championship games. In 
addition, since the games will be 
played on Flagstaff Hill, which is 
not Carnegie Mellons private 
property, an IM supervisor will 
be present at each game. This 
person will be in constant radio 
contact with security to prevent 
any problems associated with not 
playing directly on the private 
campus.
This is the third year the 
Officials Club has been in service 
at Carnegie Mellon. Last year 
was very good, said Mastroianni. 
People got used to the system 
more. We need another year to 
really get moving.
Out of all the people who signed 
up this year for the club, 31 are 
returning from last year for 
football alone, according to 
Mastroianni. He added that most 
people in the club like to officiate
more than one sport which can 
make for more enthusiastic and 
better qualified officials.
Occasionally, youre going to 
have some teams complain about 
the officiating, its almost 
unavoidable, said Mastroianni. 
People have to realize that the 
officials are not there to take 
anything away from either one of 
the teams. He added that the 
system would be a lot worse if 
each team had to provide their 
own officials.
If I was the last guy on the 
team so I had to be the one to be 
the ref, I wouldnt like that, he 
said.With this system, that kind 
of pressure is taken off of the 
teams.
Aside from enforcing the rules, 
the officials will make sure that 
all the necessary equipment is 
already at the fields and that the 
schedules are followed so that 
time or effort by the players or 
themselves is wasted. Such 
organizational duties are often 
overlooked by the players. 
Mastroianni concluded.
Due to the Officials Club, IM 
athletes should find the games 
much more fun and rewarding.

The CMU womens volleyball 
am got off to a slow start this 
ieason, losing matches to PittJohnstown (UPJ) and Carlow 
College last Wednesday evening. 
The Lady Tartans fared a little 
better on Friday during the pre
liminary round of the Carnegie 
; Mellon Volleyball Invitational, 
but were unable to qualify for the 
ilay-offs on Saturday afternoon. 
The top two winners in each 
iooI advance to the play-offs, and 
pe finished third, said Head 
loach Sue Flaherty.
Fifteen teams representing 
schools from Pennsylvania, Ohio 
and West Virginia participated in 
;he tournament. In their pool 
division, the Lady Tartans were 
pitted against UPJ, Mt. Union, 
Mercyhurst and Marietta Col
leges.
Carnegie Mellons first match 
)f Friday evening was against Mt. 
Union. The Lady Tartans lost the 
irst game (4-15), but bounced 
ack to take the match by win
ing the next two games (15-9, 
5-9). Sophomore Nicole Hanak 
d senior Diane Watson led the 
artan offense with a total of nine 
ills, while junior Laurie Shulaker had 11 assists.
Defensively, junior Kris Loh 
recorded six digs for the Lady 
Tartans.
Mercyhurst, CMUs next oppo
nent of the night, won the best of 
three match in two games (4-15, 
11-15). Hanak, Watson and Shu
maker combined for ten kills and 
eleven assists.
Saturday morning, the team 
faced UPJ for the second time in 
four days. This time, it took three 
games to determine the winner. 
CMU won the first game (15-9), 
while UPJ won the last two games 
of the match (6-15, 5-15).
Junior Lynne Truskie notched 
five kills for the Lady Tartans 
while Loh and Shumaker added 4 
apiece. Shumaker also led the 
team in assists with 13.
Marietta was the last match of 
the tournament for Carnegie 
Mellon. The Lady Tartans were 
defeated in two games (6-15, 10- 
15), despite fine efforts by the 
team. Watson and sophomore 
Cindy Peperak were key offen
sively, recording seven and five 
kills, respectively.
Leading Carnegie Mellon in as
sists was Shumaker with 10. De
fensive highlights for the Tartans 
were the six solo blocks by Ha
nak, and five digs each by Pep
erak and Truskie.
Every time we played, we
improved, said Flaherty. The 
tournament gives us an opportu
nity to really scrimmage.
Flaherty added that its a good 
way to prepare for the President's 
Athletic Conference and the Uni
versity Athletic Association 
teams.
Allegheny, Kenyon, Marietta 
and Waynesburg advanced to the 
semi-finals of the tournament.
The Lady Tartans lost to UPJ 
on Wednesday by the score of 12- 
15,12-15. Offensively, Hanak had 
the team high of five kills, while 
Peperak and Shumaker added 
four apiece. Shumaker had 13 
assists. A total of 11 digs by Loh 
and Truskie and five solo blocks 
by Hanak sparked the defense.
Carlow was also victorious over 
CMU in two games (12-15, IS
IS). Hanak recordedfour kills and 
four solo blocks for the Lady Tar
tans. Freshman Debra Perry also 
had four kills.
We have a small team, only 9 
people, so it took awhile to get our 
act together, said Flaherty, but 
we played well.
The team will travel to the Baldwin-Wallace College Tournament 
this weekend.
Carnegie Mellons first PAC 
game will be against Grove City 
at Skibo Gym next Monday, Sep
tember 19th, starting at 6:00 pm.

Verlorenes Leben. The movie 
focuses on the question of justice, 
guilt and atonement. In Berlin 
during the last days of the war, a 
priest explains to a member of the 
Hitler Youth the reasons for 
choosing his vocation. In 1927 he 
had worked as an informant for 
the police homicide squad and 
during that time he was asked to 
assist in bringing the murderer of 
a young girl to justice. To gain the 
suspects confidence he had acted 
as his friend and thus obtained a 
confession. Protrayed is the lost 
life of two individuals, one being 
executed for the crime he commit
ted, the other having to live with 
an everlasting feeling of guilt for 
his active part in the conviction.
