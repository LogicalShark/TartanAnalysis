Hampton Inn is home, sweet 
home for some freshmen
Life in the lap of luxury is only temporary for those freshmen living at the Hampton Inn.

Faced with the need to house a large group of 
people from out-of-town, CMUs Housing Office did 
what anyone might do. They booked a block of 
rooms at the Hampton Inn in Oakland.
But these werent conventioneers  they were 
the freshman class.
This years freshman class was the largest in the 
history of Carnegie Mellon University. As a result, 
92 first-year students were forced to spend the first 
week of their college lives in the Hampton Inn.
Though the University is now in the second week 
of classes, many students are still living in the 
Hampton Inn and are shuttled to and from cam
pus.
The freshman class consists of roughly 1,300

Gore headed to Oakland
By JASON TOGYER
Tartan Acting News Editor
Vice President A1 Gore will be visiting Pitts
burgh next week to take part in a rally for 
federally-sponsored financial aid for college stu
dents.
The rally, set for Monday, September 11, is still 
in the planning stages, said Gina Schuyler, CMU 
student government president. The White House 
wants to okay things, so everything is pending 
their approval, said Schuyler.
The University of Pittsburgh campus is the 
expected site for the rally, but students from all 
area colleges and universities are being encour
aged to attend. The rally is being sponsored by 
the United States Student Association (USSA), a 
lobbying group based in Washington, D.C.
Schuyler expects Gore, local, state, and na
tional elected officials, andPittsburgh-area cam
pus leaders, to speak at the rally.
The USSA is holding the rally to protest pro7 
posed cuts in student aid, including the threat
ened elimination of the federal Perkins Loan 
program, the elimination of the interest exemp
tion on Stafford Loans, and changes in Pell 
Grant eligibility requirements.
My sense is that this is a serious, serious 
threat, said Schuyler. We need to stand up and 
say that we dont want this to happen. We have 
to send a message to Washington, not only to our 
current leaders, but to people running for elec
tion. Nows the time to tell people that we care, 
and that we need this aid.
Schuyler said that she and the other Pittsburgh-area student body presidents have tenta
tive plans for other shows of support for student 
aid, including a letter-writing campaign and a 
voter registration drive.
She said that a representative from the White 
House will meet with the student leaders tonight 
to finalize more details of the rally.
students from 48 states and 37 different countries. 
As of Friday, September 1, 55 freshmen were still 
living in the Hampton Inn. After the weekend, it 
was expected that 15 more students would be 
placed in CMU housing facilities.
Marcia Klosinski, the Housing Offices coordina
tor of assignments and conferences, anticipates 
having all first year students out of the Hampton 
Inn no later than the 15th of September.
The Hampton Inn, located on Hamlet Street 
about 20 blocks from the edge of the CMU campus, 
is at least a half-hour walk. A Hampton Inn shuttle 
arrives on a regular schedule every half-hour from 
7:30 am until 7 pm. For service from 7 pm until 1 
am, students must call the Hampton Inn, which 
sends shuttles individually. Students are also able 
to use CMUs Escort after-hours.

Integra takeover will affect students
By GEL ALTEROVTTZ
Tartan Staffwriter
Last Monday, after two months 
of negotiations, Cleveland, Ohiobased National City Bank and 
Pittsburghs Integra Financial 
Corporation announced plans for 
a merger.
The deal will allow National 
City, a $35 billion corporation, to 
expand from its current base that 
includes Ohio, Kentucky, and 
Indiana into western Pennsylva
nia. Integra has approximately 
$15 billion in assets.
According to Richard C. Green, 
professor of financial economics 
in GSIA, the merger will have 
several effects on Pittsburgh, and 
on Carnegie Mellon students, in 
the future. One beneficial effect
for the city of Pittsburgh, said 
Green, is that we all get more 
financial services at lower cost.
On the other hand, Green be
lieves that the merger has some 
potentially harmful conse
quences. The banking sector 
employs a lot of people in Pitts
burgh specifically and they are 
losing their jobs, he said. Some 
reports have estimated that at 
least 1,000 Pittsburgh-area 
Integra employees will be laidoff.
Green associates many of these 
potential layoffs with the trend 
to reduce redundant services 
and the emergence of new intelli
gent and efficient technologies. 
Computers are doing things that 
people used to do, said Green.
Green believes that Carnegie
Mellon students may face other 
changes as well, given their ten
dency to have small accounts with 
frequent transactions, a couplet 
that makes them only margin
ally profitable for banks. The re
sult of consolidation within the 
banking industry may lead to 
higher fees for these marginally 
profitable activities that [banks] 
are involved in and that could 
hurt students.
Green thinks that one positive 
change to affect students will 
come from technological initia
tives.
Larger banks will be able to 
speed this type of technological 
innovation and that should help, 
said Green. He cited pervasive 
use of technologies like automatic

News Analysis
By JASON TOGYER
Tartan Acting News Editor
[Ed. Note: This is the first in a 
series of articles detailing the Rimm 
study and its aftermath.]
A Carnegie Mellon ECE alums re
search landed him the cover of Time 
magazine, a feature in the 
Georgetown Law Journal, and an 
invitation to speak before the United 
States Senate this summer.
It also landed him in hot water 
with the Internet community and 
the University.
Martin Rimms study, Marketing 
Pornography on the Information Su
perhighway, was completed early 
this year after 18 months of work. 
But while the controversial study 
was at first embraced by people seek
ing greater regulation of the Internet, 
others have said its fatally flawed.
Among the complaints raised about 
the study:
 Rimm invaded the privacy of An
drew users by monitoring which 
newsgroups they had read;
 Rimm used data gathered from 
privately operated adult bulletinboard systems (BBSs) to make geners;
 Rimm controlled access to the 
study so that it could not be peerreviewed before publication;
 Rimm attempted to conceal his 
status as a undergraduate, and in
stead portrayed his research as offi
cially sanctioned by the University;
 Rimms study draws conclusions 
unsubstantiated by the data collected;
 Rimms background suggests an 
agenda and raises questions about 
his credibility and objectivity.
On August 8, responding to heated 
criticism about the study from re
searchers, scientists, and interested 
parties around the country, Provost 
Paul Christiano announced in a memo 
that the University was conducting 
an investigation into the studys 
scholarship and the methods by which 
data were acquired and used.
The investigation is being headed 
by a five-member faculty committee 
formed by Christiano and the Faculty 
Senate. A spokesperson from the 
Provost's Office said that Christiano 
would not comment on the commit
tee, its members, or the investigation.
Attempts to contact Rimm, a 1994 
graduate, by telephone were unsuc
cessful, and an e-mailed request for 
an interview went unanswered.

said that Rimm, 30, had not been in

Theres a new club to join this year  
the Carnegie Mellon University Dining 
Club  and most freshmen have joined 
it whether they want to or not.
The club is the new Dining Services 
meal plan system. The changes were 
made to help the department eliminate 
its $1 million debt.
One big change from the old block 
meal and DineXpress meal plans is that 
the plans are now non-refundable. The 
old plans also carried over the meals and 
money not used until the next school 
year, which is no longer the case. Mike 
Rosenthal, SDC food chair, said that 
refundable meal plans were unfair to 
Dining Services, even if they seemed the 
best policy to students.
In the long run, the refundable plans 
endup hurting students, because all the 
money is spent on fixed costs, which cuts 
down on food quality, said Rosenthal.
Mark Hamlin, director of Dining Ser
vices, explained that his department is 
trying to keep costs down and keep in
come projections accurate.
Our charge as a department, from the 
University administration, was to break 
even, and also make some money so that 
it can be applied against the debt, said 
Hamlin. Dining Services lost $800,000 
last year alone.
According to Hamlin, this comes par
tially from the fact that dining facilities 
must be maintained, and full-time staff 
retained all year, even though theyre 
only really needed for eight months.

Can rock and roil hall 
save Clevelands image?
CLEVELAND, Ohio, Sep. 1 (DJ)  
The long-awaited Rock and Roll Hall 
of Fame and Museum is open here on 
theshoresofLakeErie,butisitenough 
to make this much-maligned city a 
tourist draw?
Philip Kotler, a marketing profes
sor at Northwestern University, 
doubts the museums ability to draw 
crowds to Cleveland.
It will take more than one attrac
tion to do that, he says. "Cleveland 
will be a destination for Ohioans but 
(the rock hall) is not going to get 
people from San Francisco to go there. 
Besides, what else has Cleveland got? 
It needs more of a personality.
The city does have the Cleveland
 Museum of Art, which is mounting a 
tie-in exhibit to the museum opening 
r Elvis + Marilyn: 2X Immortal (on 
Elvis Presley and Marilyn Monroe).
Down the street, the Western Re
serve Historical Society will host an 
. exhibit called Sounds of Cleveland.
: The 128-year-old institution is even 
considering moving its auto and avia
tion collection closer to the rock hall.
The Cleveland Public Library has 
set up a free It All Started Here 
exhibit and is offering assistance to 
those who want to do some serious 
research on rock music.
'. Meanwhile, the real sponsors - 
those who shelled out a lot of money to 
have their names associated with the 
rock hall  are placing large bets on
what the event will do to their image.
Consider KeyCorp. The stodgy 
bankholding company paid $2 million 
to have the rock halls main plaza 
named Key Plaza. It is unveiling juke
box-shaped automated-teller ma
chines at the hall that play rock hits 
when not dispensing cash or museum 
tickets.
Though plans to launch a rock n roll 
affinity credit card (with a free classicrock compact disc upon signup) are on 
hold, the bank plans a Rock n Save 
program for preteens.
Banking doesnt always have to be 
serious, says Stephen Cone, 
KeyCorps chief marketing executive.
Some marketing gurus are skepti
cal. What does a bank ... have to do 
with rock n roll? wonders Jack Trout 
of Trout & Partners, a Greenwich, 
Conn., marketing-strategy firm. The 
more tenuous the connection, the moi e 
people who are not going to get it. 
Moreover, he says, visitors will have 
to contend with the weather: Cleve
land is not a great spot in the middle of 
the winter.
But Clevelanders wont brook any 
such negativism. All that talk is just 
petty, says Donna Pavlik ofthe Cleve
land Jaycees, who have moved their 
annual Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 5K 
run from Memorial Day to Labor Day. 
Cleveland has been picked at for so 
manyyears. Why shouldnt people now 
get excited?
Feds may halt media merger
Concerns raised over Time Warner-Turner
' NEW YORK, Sep. 1 (D J)Federal 
antitrust regulators may challenge 
Time Warner Inc.s possible takeover 
of Turner Broadcasting System, The 
Washington Post reports.
While stressing that no decisions 
' have been made while the deal is still 
in negotiations, regulators have nev
ertheless begun looking into whether 
the proposed merger would restrict 
market competition for movie distri
bution on pay-cable networks.
The merger is seen as creating a 
company with a greatly increased 
ability to produce movies and then 
distribute them on wholly or partially 
owned pay cable channels.
The merged company would itself 
be partially owned by two other com
panies, Tele-Communications Inc. 
(TCI) and Seagram Co., that own 
movie studios, cable systems and pay 
cable networks.
The newspaper reports that one se
nior official said, I think it raises 
some concerns. When you put all these 
companies together, you have a direct 
overlap in the movie business and an 
(interlocking) stake in the premium 
channels.
The federal governments antitrust 
lawyers in the Justice Department 
and Federal Trade Commission would 
not make public comments about the 
matter.
TCIs Washington attorney dis
missed the notion that the Time 
Wamer-Tumer merger would pose 
antitrust problems because the com
panies commanded so small a share of 
Hollywood production, as well as the 
fact that both TCI and Seagram would 
hold non-controlling stakes in the 
merged company.
The Washington Post also reported 
Time Warner sources sayingthat they 
expect Seagram to gradually sell its 
Time Warner shares.
Viruses prey on Windows 95
NEW YORK, Sep. 1 (DJ)  Microsoft 
Corp. said some buyers of Windows 95 
have found the floppy diskette version of 
the program can be ruined by a virus on 
their machines.
Windows 95 itself does not carry a 
virus, the company said. Windows 95 is 
the first major revision in five years to 
the program that runs the basic func
tions of most personal computers. It went 
on sale last week with an unprecedented 
marketing blitz for a computer product.
However, some people have said they 
cannot get the program on their com
puter because the second of 13 diskettes 
halts dining installation. This happens 
because it has been corrupted by a virus, 
software that harms other programs, 
Microsoft said.
Duringinstallation, a computer trans
fers information that the customer has 
typed in and a custom ID number to the 
second diskette. A virus can move to the 
diskette during that process.
Unfortunately, theres not just one 
virus that spreads this way, said Rogers 
Weed, group product manager for Win
dows 95.
Viruses do not affect the CD-ROM 
version of Windows 95 because data can 
only be read from a compact disc, not 
written to it.
The company will replace the first two 
diskettes of Windows 95 for people who 
encounter the problem. Weed suggested 
that people ran a virus check of their 
computer before installing the program. 
Such a warning is also on the stickers of 
the Windows 95 diskettes.
Floppy diskettes can also be write 
protected, shut off from receiving infor
mation, by closing the tab in the upper 
left comer.
Microsoft says that only two percent of 
all users will experience the problem, 
but some people arent buying the expla
nation. The (Microsoft) support engi
neer didnt invent the figure of two per
cent, said Steven Morstad, a computer 
consultant in Madison, Wis. The speci
ficity of the engineers comment tells me 
that theres a reason, so I cant accept 
the Microsoft disclaimer.
Some doubted that a vims would cause 
the problem. I dont think its a virus, 
said one user, who said he scanned his 
PC for viruses and had antivirus soft
ware in place.
He bought a second set of disks, which 
were installed fine. But after he rebooted 
the computer, his hard drive failed.
Navy impounds Iraqi diesel fuel
MANAMA, Bahrain, Sep. 1 (DJ)  
U.S. Navy ships helping to enforce U.N. 
sanctions against Iraq have impounded 
a tanker suspected of parrying Iraqi oil, 
a naval spokesman said.
Commander T. McCreary, spokesman 
of the U.S. Navys Fifth Fleet, said the 
Saint Vincent-flagged Fairsky was 
turned over to a friendly nation in the 
region, which will determine its disposi
tion along with the U.N. sanctions com
mittee.
He did not name the country to which 
the vessel had been diverted, or its des
tination.
McCreary said the Fairsky came out 
of Iraqi waters and was believed to be 
carrying Iraqi diesel, when it was inter
cepted by U.S. Navy sailors in mid-Au
gust.
He said the Navy had gathered sub
stantial evidence that the tanker was 
carrying Iraqi oil before impounding it 
permanently.
There are fewer ships trying to break 
the sanctions, because of strict enforce
ment by the multinational U.N. Mari
time Interception Operation, said 
McCreary, whose fleet is part of that 
team.
He said the Fairsky was the first ship 
caught since May. Last October we 
caught seven, he said.
The U.N. sanctions have been in force 
ever since Iraq invaded Kuwait in Au
gust 1990 and occupied the emirate for 
seven months.
Cokes not real thing in Iran
ATLANTA, August 31 (DJ)  CocaCola Co. has stopped delivery of its for
mula following a U.S. ban on trade with 
Iran, the companys local subsidiary, 
Nushab Co., said in a newspaper adver
tisement.
Coca-Cola spokeswoman Kathryn 
Norton at the companys Atlanta head
quarters confirmed it hasnt shipped 
concentrate to Iran since President 
Clinton imposed the boycott.
The ad in the Kayhan daily said the 
local firm would continue to use the 
trademark Coke bottles for the time 
being. But they will be filled with locally 
made orange sodas until new bottles 
could be produced.
Coca-Cola returned to Iran only last 
year after a 15-year ban brought on by 
the 1979 Islamic revolution.
Greenpeace ship boarded again
PAPEETE, Tahiti, Sep. 1 (DJ)  
French Navy commandos boarded the 
Greenpeace ship Rainbow Warrior II 
today as it entered territorial waters 
near Frances South Pacific nuclear test
ing site, Greenpeace said.
Greenpeace spokeswoman Stephanie 
Mills, who is aboard the Rainbow War
rior, said that naval commandos boarded 
the boat as it entered French territorial 
waters around Mururoa atoll.
Tension between French authorities 
and protesters mounted as France pre
pared to detonate the first of up to eight 
underground nuclear tests on Mumroa 
and nearby Fangataufa atoll.
Today was the first possible day for 
the start of testing, which is to continue 
until May 1996.
Clintons hopes ride on economy
WASHINGTON, D.C., Aug. 27 (DJ) 
If Bill Clinton has any hope at all of 
being a two-term President, he must 
soon get the country to concentrate four
square on the economy. Forget 
Whitewater, forget Waco  such dra
mas may make for good television, but 
when it comes to voting, most Ameri
cans are driven by pocketbook issues.
Thats where Joseph Stiglitz comes in. 
Chairman of the Presidents Council of 
Economic Advisers, Stiglitz is just the 
man to help Clinton analyze the issues, 
take credit for the economic recovery 
and critique whatever the Republican 
Congress has wrought.
A star economist from Stanford 
Universitys conservative Hoover Insti
tute, Stiglitz shares many of Clintons 
more liberal views while also holding 
firm to the belief that markets drive, the 
economy. Stiglitz gets unusually high 
marks from conservatives.
He is one of brightest economists of 
his generation. We tried to hire him 
when I was at Chicago, says Milton 
Friedman, the pioneering free-market 
economist long associated with the Uni
versity of Chicago and, more recently, 
with the Hoover Institute.
Though Stiglitz didnt become chair
man of the Council of Economic Advis
ers until June, he has helped shape 
policy on everything from taxes to inter
national trade.
Aside from being brilliant, Stiglitz is 
persuasive, in large part because he 
himself is open to hearing dissenting 
views and confident enough to change 
his mind. His predecessor, Laura Tyson, 
had a much more aggressive style. 
Stiglitz, on the other hand, is a round, 
furry person who smiles through his 
graying beard most of the time that hes 
talking. He isnt glib; in fact, he often 
stammers. The problem seems to be that 
he thinks far faster than he talks. Yet 
theres not a trace of intellectual arro
gance in his tone. Nor is he an absentminded professor.
Before landing at the Hoover Insti
tute, Stiglitz taught at M.I.T., Yale, 
Oxford, Princeton and Stanford. He also 
has impressive experience in the real 
world. An expert in corporate finance 
and in public spending, Stiglitz has 
battled the IRS. And won.
Up until now, Stiglitz has been a quiet ' 
counselor. No one in this town knew his 
name, but hes had the Presidents ear 
for the past two years, declares Ethan 
Siegal, a Washington analyst. Stiglitz 
is a thinker; Clinton likes to see himself 
as a thinker and finds him fascinating.

Carnegie Almanac
50 YEARS AGO, October 9, 
1945: Freshman are asked to 
know the history of Carnegie Tech 
and all songs and yells in the 
Freshman handbook, reported 
The Carnegie Tartan.
Freshman boys are required 
to wear the traditional dinks and 
ties (plaid for engineers and 
Windsors for fine arts boys). The 
girls are required to wear bean
ies with vari-colored tassels des
ignating their schools.
While all this might have 
seemed bad enough, frosh in 
1945 were forced to abide by these 
regulations until passage of the 
traditions exam.
25 YEARS AGO, September 3, 
1970: Apathy wasnt a problem 
at Caraegie-Mellon in the early
70s. As a result of last Mays 
activities at the C-MU ROTC of
fice several C-MU students are 
currently under investigation by 
the FBI, reported The Tartan.
During the height of the stu
dent protest movement in May of 
1970, Camegie-Mellon students 
reacted to world events by par
ticipating in the national student 
strike.
The ROTC office was broken 
into and ransacked. While few 
people actually entered the of
fice, a crowd of approximately 
1,000 demonstrated outside, said 
The Tartan.
10 YEARS AGO, September 
10,1985: CMUs proposal to build 
a hotel behind Morewood Gar
dens was a hot topic 10 years ago.
A 150-to-250 room hotel and 
conference center may be built by 
an outside development group... 
at an estimated cost of $35 mil
lion, reported The Tartan.
Then-President Richard Cyert 
said, Its a facility we need and 
we think Oakland needs. Con
cerns included the extreme strain 
on parking facilities the hotel 
would have created, especially 
since the Gesling Stadium park
ing garage had not been built yet.
5 YEARS AGO, September 4, 
1990: The man who CMU Police 
Sergeant William Ricci once 
called CMUs resident protestor 
was in the news again.
Vincent Eirene, principally 
known for his opposition to the 
Software Engineering Institute,
charged that the School of Com
puter Science was involved in 
defense contracting.
At a press conference in front of j 
Doherty Hall, Eirene cited an SCS ; 
report called Final Report on ; 
Supercomputer Research as evi| 
dence that the college was build
ing weapons for the defense de
partment.
Eirene also claimed that the 
system developed in that project | 
was aboard the USS Carl Vinson, 
and in use in the Persian Gulf j 
War. A Pentagon spokesman said 
that only the Vinson was involved 
in the research, and that ship 
was in safe harbor off the coast of i 
California.

The effects of the merger will not be
come apparent until the merger is ap
proved, a process which is projected to 
take until the second quarter of1996 to 
complete.
William Eiler, public relations man
ager at Integra, said that until the sec
ond quarter of 1996, there will be no 
immediate changes in the Integra sys
tem.
In the long run, Eiler believes that 
Integra branches will change as a result 
of the merger. Branches will be able to 
offer increased products, new product 
lines, [and] new technology, he said.
The National City-Integra statement 
came on the same day as the merger 
announcement by New York-based 
Chemical Bank and Chase Manhattan.
According to Richard Green, these 
bank mergers are no coincidence. In 
fact, Green sees it as the newest trend in

the banking industry. The sort of 
changes and consolidations that we saw 
in manufacturing in the 1980s are now 
affecting banking, said Green. They 
are eliminating all sorts of services that 
are redundant or duplicated and the 
way you do that is through mergers.
The new string of bank-related merg
ers come amid a frenzy of merger-re
lated announcements in the media in
dustry that included such names as Pitts
burgh-based Westinghouse Electric and 
CBS, Disney and Capital Cities/ABC, 
and Time-Warner and Turner Broad
casting.
While Green sees media industry con
solidation as an overall trend as well, he 
believes that it is not directly related to 
the bank mergers.
Green cites the effects of deregulation 
in the early 1980s and technology shifts 
as the primary sources for the merger 
mania in general, although he believes 
these two factors have been operating 
differently within media and banking.

ton Inn is a smaller hotel, CMU stu
dents are their number one priority.
They were really anxious to get our 
business, so they worked really hard in 
striking a good deal for us, said 
Michael. A spokesperson for the Hamp
ton Inn said that CMU is paying $72 
per room, or $19 less than the standard 
rate for a double.
First-year students who were placed 
in the Hampton Inn were warned in 
July and officially notified approxi
mately two weeks before they arrived 
on campus. Students are placed in CMU 
housing based on the date of receipt of 
their housing deposit. Those who sent 
their deposits in after all of the housing 
spaces were filled were placed in the 
Hampton Inn.
To expedite the process of placing 
first-year students, Klosinski said that 
the Housing Office offered at the end of 
the summer to break anyones housing 
contract and refund their $200 deposit. 
We just decided to extend that offer, 
for a limited time, until everyone is out 
of the Hampton Inn, said Klosinski.
Even though many of the original 
Hampton Inn residents have been 
placed, there is still a good sense of 
community, said Carrie Smith of the 
Residence Life office. Smith is coordi
nator of ResLife for Apartments and, 
temporarily at least, for the Hampton 
Inn.
[The resident assistants] have been 
doing a lot of programming to make
sure that people get back on campus. 
Kelly ODonnell [one of the three RAs 
for the Inn] is making a list of where'  
people are going to be after they leave, _ 
Smith said. For movie night [on Thurs-:; 
day] they had six people who had moved 
onto campus come back down to go to 
the program.
Because of the hotels distance from 
campus, and because of a well-publicized robbery and shooting there last 
year, some people have voiced safety 
concerns.
The only safety we are concerned 
about is that people not walk between 
here and campus, said Smith. The 
roads just arent intended [for that]! 
There is a lot of traffic and a lot of 
distance in between here and the Hamp
ton Inn.
The Housing Office is placing people 
as soon as spaces become available! 
This includes a freeze on room changes 
so that students in the Hampton Inn 
have first priority.
Crime and Incident Reports
8/25 DUMPSTER FIRE, 6:53 pm. A 
student phoned Campus Police report
ing that one of the dumpster behind one 
of the fraternities was on fire. Some 
students were dousing the fire with water 
hoses. The fire department was sum
moned and checked the dumpster.
8/28 DISORDERLY CONDUCT,
2:36 pm. Two officers heard a loud series 
of fire crackers going off on the patio of 
one of the fraternities. They approached 
a fraternity official and told him that he 
had five minutes to bring the party re
sponsible for lighting the fire crackers 
out of the house, or the officers would
issue a CMU citation to the house. After 
a few minutes, a former CMU student 
was brought out of the house. A state 
citation was issued.
8/29 THEFT, 3:18 pm. A CMU staffer 
reported that there were fifty computers 
in one of the clusters in Wean Hall on 
Augustl8. However, on August 20, when 
the room was checked, one of the ma
chines, valued at $3,500, was missing.
The Tartan prints the Crime and Inci
dent Report under the following guide
lines:
 Chief of Campus Police James
LaPaglia reviews all reports prior to 
their release.
 Only three people on The Tartan 
staff see the reports: the Editor-in-Chief, 
the News Editor, and the staff member 
typing the reports.
 All personal names of complainants, 
victims, and suspects, and fraternity 
names, are omitted from the printed re
port. Ethnic descriptions and other per
sonal details are given only in the context 
of a complete description.
 Not every incident that occurs on 
campus appears in the report.

Dining Services works to balance budget; some students balk at change
DINING, from page 1
student committee called the 
Presidential Committee on Din
ing.
There was also a survey done 
last spring which gave informa
tion concerning where, when, and 
how much students eat. This 
survey gathered much of the in
formation which was incorpo
rated into the new meal plans.
First-year resident students are 
required to purchase a 10,12, or 
14-meal plan which each include 
varying amounts of DineXpress 
dollars. The other optional meal 
plans, aimed at upperclassmen 
and faculty and staff, offer five to 
seven meals per week, with vary
ing amount of CampusXpress dol
lars. The meals do not carry over 
week to week and the dollars do 
not carry over to the next semes
ter.
The CampusXpress dollars are 
a new component of the meal plan 
which, according to Hamlin, will 
hopefully make the meal plans 
more attractive to students.
Even freshmen living in University-operated apartments, 
which include kitchenettes, are 
required to purchase meal plans. 
In the past, these freshmen could 
drop the meal plans once they got 
to campus and tried their new 
apartments out.
Hamlin said that this keeps 
the non-refundability of the meal 
plans consistent. In addition, he 
said that Murphy suggested that 
this was a way to ensure that 
freshmen would interact, and so 
that their parents would know 
that they were eating regular 
meals.
According to Hamlin, there 
have been mixed reactions from 
students. The negatives he has 
been hearing are the closing of 
Highlander on Saturday, no hot 
breakfast in Highlander, and the 
inability to get out of the meal 
plan. Students have also been 
angry about Wok N* Rolls nonacceptance of block meals.
According to Michael 
Rosenthal, the SDC food chair, 
Highlander was only getting 
about 200 customers on Satur
day, which was not enough to 
keep Highlander open. Brenden 
Mielke, the former chair of the 
Presidential Committee on Din
ing, said that one big problem 
was that Dining Services was of
ten competing against itself. The
same food was being served at 
Morewood and Highlander, which 
is one reason Highlander now 
serves only a limited hot break-; 
fast.
As for the complaints about the 
refundability issue, according to 
Rosenthal, CMU was one of only 
three or four universities in the 
country which offered a refund
able meal plan, and they usually 
prove unprofitable.
Rosenthal explained that the 
new meal plan is one like most 
universities have. Its intended 
to allow Dining Services to also 
make capital improvements, such 
as the new chairs in Highlander.
According to Hamlin, Dining. 
Services is also committed to im
proving the quality of the food. 
The Veg-out was added to High
lander, which offers low fat and 
low-calorie vegetarian foods. Less
oil will also be used, which, ac
cording to Hamlin, is a training 
commitment on the part of the 
management. If the comments 
received say the food is greasy or 
oily, it will be looked into.
Rosenthal says, The food does 
seem to be getting better around 
campus in general.
There are still complaints from 
students, particularly upper
classmen, about food availability
and the new meal plans. Brad 
Fittz, a junior IM major, has many 
concerns about the new meal 
plans. He feels the system was 
never explained clearly, and said 
most of what he knows was 
learned second-hand. High
lander food is exactly the same as 
in the past, said Fittz. Im 
switching back to the seven meal 
plan because the new plans are 
so awful. Its also wrong that you
cant use the meals at Wok N* 
Roll.
Wok N Roll, which is operated 
for Dining Services by Yum Wok 
Restaurant, accepted block meals 
last year. Hamlin said that this 
was an incentive for students to 
try Wok N5 Roll last year, but 
that Dining Services decided not 
to continue the experiment. Din
ing Services has no plans to ac 
cept block meals at Wok N Rol

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  5 September 19955
Undergraduate research project lands ECE alumnus in hot water
RIMM, from page 1
touch with his office for several 
months, and no longer seemed to 
be granting interviews.
I thought it was a parody of 
a study
Donna Hoffman is a professor 
of management specializing in 
the statistical study of human 
behavior at Vanderbilt Univer
sity in Nashville, Tennessee. She 
first heard from Marty Rimm 
when he contacted her and ex
pressed an interest __________
perts, not behavioral science ex
perts, not statisticians, said 
Hoffman. I consider them com
pletely unqualified to review this 
paper.
Ruemmler thinks thats unfair 
and that it has scary implica
tions.
People who are supposed to be 
anti-censorship are going to try 
to tell us what were supposed to 
publish? she said.
The Journal didnt have the 
study scientifically reviewed, bein her doctoral pro
gram at Vanderbilt.
Later, he sent her 
a pre-publication 
summary of his 
study for review.
She was shocked by 
what she saw.
I thought it was 
a parody of a study,
she said. The state----------------
ments being made 
in the abstract were 
things that he couldnt possibly 
have known. To her horror, 
she said, Rimm told her that the 
study was about to be published in the Georgetown Law Journal, 
a publication of the law school at 
Georgetown University.
At first, she wasnt too con
cerned. He was an undergradu
ate from double-E, publishing a 
study in a law journal. I thought, 
Whos going to see this?
Hoffman wasnt aware that 
Rimm had also made a deal with 
Time magazine, offering exclu
sive pre-publication rights to the 
story to veteran technology re
porter Philip Elmer-DeWitt.
Elmer-DeWitt was unavailable 
for comment this week, but he 
apparently met Rimm while cov
ering CMUs attempt to ban the 
alt.sex.* hierarchy from Andrew 
[CMU censors bboards, 11/7/94; 
Community protests censorship 
of bboards, 11/14/94].
Rimm is mentioned several 
times in that November 21,1994 
Time article, Censoring Cyber
space, and is identified only as a 
[CMU] research associate.
In fact, the Universitys move 
to ban those newsgroups 
stemmed from a preliminary draft 
ofRimms study that he offered to 
the administration. Rimm 
claimed that some of the images 
available in Usenet groups had 
been ruled obscene by a Tennes
see court a few months before, 
and that the University was open
ing itself to prosecution by mak
ing them available.
They never thought to ask
Some, including Vanderbilts 
Hoffman, have accused Rimm of 
attemptingto use the Universitys 
clout to lend credibility to his 
work.
If it was his intention to hide 
behind the University, then that 
is problematic, said Peter 
Madsen, director of CMUs Cen
ter for the Advancement of Ap
plied Ethics (CAAE).
Rimms apparent status as a 
CMU researcher was enough to 
open all sorts of doors for him. 
According to Cathy Ruemmler, 
current editor-in-chief of the 
Georgetown Law Journal, the 
magazines previous editors never 
really asked about Rimms cre
dentials when he submitted the 
study.
They may have assumed he 
was a graduate student but they 
never thought to ask, said 
Ruemmler. This is unusual but I 
think it became more unusual in 
hindsight. I wouldnt want to sec
ond-guess the previous board of 
editors. Hindsight is 20/20.
Ruemmler said that the Rimm 
study and accompanying articles 
in that issue, written by legal 
experts, were intended as a mini
symposium on pornography and 
the Internet. The Journal, in 
publishing this, was trying to fur
ther debate and promote discus
sion about the issues that were 
raised.
Rimms decision to have the 
study .published in a legal jour
nal, rather than a scientific or 
technical journal, has come in for 
criticism.
Law professors are legal exPornography is a controversial topic. 
If youre going to study It, you have to 
approach it in a circumspect and 
scholarly way.
 CMU professor David Banks
cause it wasnt concerned with 
the scientific methodology behind 
it only the legal issues it raised.
We didnt have a lot of reasons to be concerned in that sense. We 
didnt have reason to be suspi
cious, Ruemmler said. How the 
data was gathered is an internal 
Carnegie Mellon concern.
Credentials in question
Should Rimms study have ever 
gotten published?
Vanderbilts Hoffman says, 
emphatically, no.
It is methodologically \yeak, 
conceptually weak, and has no 
theory behind it, she says. This 
is not rigorous scholarly research. 
Its about what you would expect 
from an undergraduate in EE who 
has not been trained in psychol
ogy, marketing, or social science.
Whats worse, she says, is that 
the study was presented as some
thing from a research team at
did a reliability study for each 
subcategory of photo to see if the 
parsers classification agreed with 
a humans classification.
It was a very complicated pro
cess, and the different reliability 
levels for each of the subcatego
ries were quite high, said Banks. 
Banks said that while he didnt 
see the actual numbers, the 
parsers reliability in some sub
categories was estimated by 
Rimm at about 97 percent.
Theres virtually no statistical
__________________ content in
the pa
per, said 
Banks, 
[but] the 
methodol
ogy and 
the con
clusions 
that are in 
there are 
actually 
more 
sturdy
than its critics are willing to grant. 
Some of it could have been done 
more carefully, but all this was 
done before I came on board. 
However, Banks said that the 
study is seriously flawed in that 
many of the conclusions Rimm 
draws from this data are not sup
ported by it.
Others have questioned Rimms 
use of the logfile in each Andrew 
users directory that shows which 
newsgroups theyve read, which 
theyre subscribed to, and when 
they last read them.
Most Andrew users are either 
unaware that this file, called 
.newsrc, exists, are unsure how 
to block access to it, or dont care 
who looks at it.
Computing Services uses this 
file to compile the arbitron rat
ing statistics for each newsgroup, 
but anonymizes the user infor
mation.
However, on most Andrew acCMU, giving it the appearance of counts created prior to this year,
the Universitys imprimatur. In 
fact, authorship is claimed only 
by Rimm.
David Banks, a CMU statistics 
professor who is thanked in the 
studys acknowledgements, says 
he joined the study in July 1994 
to give statistical advice and ana
lyze data.
A grad student in our depart
ment felt the study needed more 
expertise and sent him to me, he 
said. Banks and others named in 
the study have since denied hav
ing any substantial role in the 
research.
He left the study in November 
of 1994 after having disagree
ments with Rimms methods, but 
said that he couldnt elaborate on 
his reasons. He said that hes 
conscientiously trying to follow 
the confidentiality guidelines set 
by the provost, and limited his 
comments to issues that were al
ready matters of public record.
Banks said that a substantial 
portion of the research was com
pleted before he was asked to join 
the study.
One portion of the study in
volved subscribing to commercial 
bulletin boards that supply por
nography, said Banks. Users of 
these BBSs look at a list of cap
tions supplied by the boards op
erator and decide if they want to 
download the pictures for a fee. 
Banks said that Rimm used a 
linguistics parser that classified 
the caption based on certain key
words in the caption, and then

Debate over studys 
conclusions is heated
Hoffman has been among the 
studys most vociferous critics 
ever since the Time magazine 
cover story, On a Screen Near 
You: Cyberporn, appeared in 
early July.
In their detailed critique of the 
study and the Time article, 
Hoffman and fellow Vanderbilt 
professor Thomas Novak list sev
eral examples of what they call of 
invalid or inflammatory conclu
sions.
Rimm writes that it is clear 
that pornography is being vigor
ously marketed in increasingly 
sophisticated ways. In fact, write 
Hoffman and Novak, the study 
offers no evidence to support the 
claim.
In another part of the study, 
where Rimm talks about Andrew 
users and their newsgroup us
age, he writes that 11 percent of 
all Andrew users block others 
from reading the files in their 
directory detailing which 
newsgroups theyve read in order
end, said Banks. The [83.5 per
cent statistic] is clearly wrong.
In a response published on the 
World Wide Web, Rimm blasted 
the lengthy Hoffman and Novak 
critique, saying it was written in 
haste, and asked what Ms. 
Hoffman and Mr. Novaks real 
agenda is in rushing into publica
tion ... such an overwrought cri
tique?
It is not surprising that the 
critique, which was quickly pre
pared (in less than five days) by 
two psychologists in a field (por
nography on computer networks) 
where they have apparently done 
little scholarly research, falls 
short of the mark, writes Rimm.
It is peculiar that two busi
ness faculty from a well-known 
university would invest consid
erable effort... [attacking] a study 
of computer pornography writ
ten by a person with a degree and 
advanced background in electri
cal and computer engineering, 
Rimm writes later, charging that 
Hoffman and Novak are over
stepping their bounds.
In fact, both Hoffman and 
Novak hold PhDs in psychology, 
and are currently conducting a
Theres so much confusion and 
complexity about the Internet, and 
the last thing we need is hysteria. 
 Donna Hoffman, professor, 
Vanderbilt University
this information can be accessed 
with just a few Unix.keystrokes. 
Even Rimm, in his study, ac
knowledges that his compilation 
of the statistics raises signifi
cant privacy issues.
Hoffman says that in both his 
study of the adult BBSs, in which 
Rimm was able to obtain the 
names, addresses, and credit card 
numbers of the BBSs users, and 
in his study of Andrew users, 
Rimm breached standard scien
tific practice. She says he should 
have gotten permission from his 
subjects to study them and 
cleared the study with the Uni
versity.
I am a behavioral scientist, 
says Hoffman. In the profession 
I move in, this kind of research 
would be considered unethical. 
This is not how youre supposed 
to treat people.
According to the Student Hand
book, accessing and using files 
in another persons directory 
when not expressly permitted to 
do so by the owner is a violation of 
that persons privacy.
On rare occassions, comput
ing staff may access other files, 
but only when strictly necessary 
for the maintenance of [the] sys
tem or in the active pursuit of 
serious security or abuse inci
dents.
In other words, said Peter 
Madsen of the CAAE, CMU does 
have community rules that pro
tect the individual privacy of di
rectories. Even if one can access
to avoid detection of their online 
activities. [I]t is possible that 
some Internet users who block 
their accounts prefer sexual im
ages of children and wish to avoid 
detection. While it is possible, 
Hoffman and Novak write that 
its certainly not a cause-and-effect relationship: Just because a 
small proportion of Andrew us
ers have figured out how to block 
their newsgroups file doesnt 
mean theyre child molesters.
Perhaps the most widely 
quoted, and criticized, statistic in 
the Rimm study is his claim that 
83.5 percent of all images posted 
on the Usenet are pornographic. 
Rimm surveyed only a handful of 
newsgroups to arrive at this fig
ure. A more accurate interpreta
tion is that 83.5 percent of the 
images posted to 32 alt.binaries 
newsgroups came from 17 groups 
that Rimm determined were por
nographic, write Hoffman and 
Novak.
The paper could not deceive 
anyone who read it from start to
five-year study of marketing on 
the Internet.
The research program, called 
Project 2000, is the very one 
that Rimm first contacted 
Hoffman about  with an inter
est in joining it. I do have an 
agenda, and my agenda is that 
Im committed to excellence and 
scholarship in research, she said. 
This study is lacking in objectiv
ity and meaningful conclusions 
on cyberspace.
Written to be as 
provocative as possible
The papers tone and language 
have also come under fire.
At the end of the paper, in the 
conclusion, hes trying to find a 
way to make the study sensa
tional, said Banks. If you read 
it, youll see why. Its written to 
be as provocative as possible. 
Rimms vivid descriptions of 
pornographic images on adult 
BBSs, and his use of the 
scatalogical terms contained in 
those images, are often graphic.
One copy of the study, downloaded 
from a World Wide Web site, car
ries the following disclaimer:
Due to the nature of the stud
ied material, Minors and Those 
Who Are Going To Be Easily Of
fended are hereby warned of 
strong language and sexual con
tent. Leave now if dealing with 
such things is going to be a prob
lem for you.
Pornography is a controver
sial topic, said Banks. If youre 
going to study it, you have to 
approach it in a circumspect and 
scholarly way.
The paper was written in such 
way as to get the maximum 
amount of publicity possible. 
Theres so much confusion and 
complexity about the Internet, 
and the last thing we need is 
hysteria, said Hoffman. Marty 
Rimm was furthering this notion 
of Its a filthy disgusting place 
out there. Basically, this study 
says, I looked at stuff on adult 
bulletin board systems and found, 
to my horror, pornography! I 
mean, duh\
Some feel that the level of the 
criticism is unwarranted. I think~ 
that the topic is so highly politi
cal that [the papers critics] sense 
is they have to refute it in order to 
preserve the freedom of the 
Internet, said Banks.
The Journal's Ruemmler 
thinks that after the controversy 
dies down, researchers will be 
able to find useful information in 
the Rimm study. The distortion 
by people on both sides of the 
issue is really unfortunate, she 
said. It ma}' be, 10 years from 
now, that people will look at this 
and say, This really is interest
ing. I hope that its someday 
looked at in an objective way. 
Ruemmler said that the study 
is unique because, for the first 
time, it presents a survey of what 
types of explicit material people 
are using without depending on 
their honesty in interviews or sur
veys. My sense is that [Rimms] 
real interest is in the adult bulle
tin boards and seeing what people 
are downloading, she said.
Hoffman disagrees. This study 
has no value whatsoever. It would 
not be right to let it exist as a 
meaningful document.
Next week: Reports about 
Rimms background lead some to 
question his motivations; allega
tions of manipulation and mis
representation.

Obligatory dining pian 
wastes student funds
THISUNE 
WLMelidApmh AW
Dining Services has laid down 
an ultimatum: if you are a first 
year students, you must by a 
meal plan. While this is common 
practice at many universities, 
CMU switched to an obligatory 
meal plan so Dining Services 
could pay off its $1 million debt.
The new plan requires students 
to purchase a minimum of seven 
block meals a week. The rest of 
the money is put into a new ac
count called Double Xpress, 
which can be used at Entropy 
and elsewhere.
If a student on the seven-mealplan only uses, for example, five 
of her meals that week, she still 
pays for seven. In other words, 
what she doesnt use, she loses. 
On the old plan, students could 
get their money (at least par
tially) returned at the end of the 
year for block meals or Dine 
Xpress they never used.
Now say this student lives in 
Doherty or Marybelle Apart
ments where she could buy gro
ceries and prepare meals in her 
kitchen. Under the new plan, 
she still must pay for seven meals 
a week.
Further, the new plan seems to 
promote the possibility that stu
dents wont use up all their meals: 
only one block can be used per 
block period. Therefore, students 
cannot take friends for dinner on 
their meal plan even if they still 
have a few block meals left at the 
end of the week. Also, students 
who may eat dinner at six in the
evening, will find that they are 
unable to use a block meal for an 
11 pm snack.
Using all block meals is also 
complicated by the curtailed 
hours of several eateries. For 
instance, Highlander isnt even 
open on Saturdays anymore. This 
leaves Pipers Cafe as the only 
place to eat on campus. Pipers 
Cafe, because it is one of a hand
ful of campus dining establish
ments, will be crowded with long 
lines of students waiting to pay 
for a bowl of some gloppy, 
noodlish, turkey kinda thingy.
All in all, the new meal system 
seems unfair. While many firstyear students may not realize 
that they are getting profession
ally ripped-off, those of us who 
had more flexible meal plans 
when we were freshman can see 
the program for what it is.
In essence, Dining Services will 
pay off their debt by making the 
more than 1,200 members of the 
freshman class buy a meal plan 
so they can make up for the 
$800,000 they lost last year. The 
program represents capitalism 
at its utter worst  Dining Ser
vices is marketing a program 
without respecting their own 
market. Their market wants 
Highlander open on the week
ends; a more diverse selection of 
eateries, and a reasonable and 
fair dining contract. Their mar
ket doesnt want to get Dining 
Services out of debt.

Local crimes demand 
heightened awareness
A series of violent crimes that 
occurred over the summer  
three rapes off campus, a driveby in front of Webster Hall which 
left a Pitt student paralyzed, and 
another drive-by right by cam
pus on Wilkins Avenue  make 
it necessary for the University 
and the student body to take a 
closer look at safety.
Carnegie Mellon already has a 
variety of services aimed to keep 
its student safe: a large policeto-student ratio (with greater 
number of patrolling officers both 
on our campus and at Pitt), an 
off-campus Shuttle and Escort 
service, the SafeWalk program 
which has students escorting fel
low students around campus, and 
a multitude of help services in
cluding sexual assault advisors, 
the Womens Center and the 
many assistants at Student Af
fairs.
However, it is the individual 
student who must take precau. tions to ensure his or her safety.
It seems that even with all of 
these safety programs, there is 
an alarming amount of crime on 
and around campus. The Uni
versity offers ways to travel 
safely, but how often do we actu
ally take advantage of these pro
grams? How many students have 
walked home alone when they 
should have called SafeWalk or 
Escort? Its usually the same 
story.
I dont have time to wait for 
the Escort van.
Its only a half mile to my
house... I dont feel like waiting 
so Ill go by myself Ill be fine.
Every night, students enroll in 
this game of chance and put 
themselves at risk. Why do we 
gamble with our lives?
Most likely it is the insulated 
college environment which 
causes a false sense of security. 
It is easy to forget the dangers of 
a city when its 3 am and all you 
want to do is be asleep in your 
bed. In light of the crimes that 
occurred this summer, both 
women and men need to be care
ful.
It was only three years ago 
when a male was raped some 10 
feet from campus., although 
women constitute the majority 
of rape and assault crimes.
Even on campus, you are not 
guaranteed securitythere are 
several poorly-lit areas such as 
the new walkway by the Student 
Center, and the parking lot be
hind Hunt Library. Call 
SafeWalk when walking there at 
night.
Watch out for each other. Call 
campus police when you see 
something suspicious going on. 
Dont walk home alone. Keep 
yours doors locked at night. Be 
careful.
While some University services 
could be expanded or improved 
upon, changes will only occur 
when students show an interest 
in their own safety. Watch out 
for each other and let the admin
istration know when you dont 
feel safe.
Shannon Gibney
I would have gotten into the Univer
sity of Michigan if I was black too. I will 
always remember these words, that my 
cousin uttered in anger, upon hearing of 
my acceptance into that school. I knew 
then, as I know now, that his response 
was not meant as a personal attack on 
me. Rather, it was the result of his own 
frustrations.This knowledge did not, 
however, lessen the outrage I felt.
With one sentence he invalidated all 
my achievements throughout high 
school.
With one sentence he distilled me into 
one facet of my personality: the black 
part. With one sentence he constructed 
my identity as a black woman who had 
benefited from affirmative action, and 
discarded my identity as the biracial 
cousin whom he had grown up with. 
Although his accusation hurt me deeply, 
it forced me to contemplate the ramifica
tions of one of the most aggressive social 
movements of our time: affirmative ac
tion.
Since my cousins assertion that affir
mative action has benefited me while it 
has harmed him, I have heard many 
similar accusations. Many of these accu
sations are perpetrated by whites, espe
cially white males, who feel that women 
and minorities are stealing power that 
is rightly theirs. They claim that affir
mative action is an social movement 
which impedes racial and social equal
ity, rather than facilitates it.
Additionally, they argue that affirma
tive action encourages employers and 
college admissions officials to expect less 
from their minority applicants, and that 
these applicants will, in turn, expect 
less of themselves. They claim that affir
mative action was an effective social 
program for its time, but that this time 
has now passed. Women and minorities 
now have much more power than we did 
during the onset of the program, so, they 
reason, it is no longer useful. I disagree 
with every one of these assertions.
Not long ago, President Clinton made 
a statement which reveals the driving 
force behind the anti-affirmative action 
movement: What we have done for 
women and minorities is a good thing, 
but we must respond to those who feel 
discriminated against.... This is a psy
chologically difficult time for the so-called 
angry white man.
Clintons claim that we, as a nation, 
must respond to the pain of white males 
in this country fails to inspire any sym
pathy in my heart.
Why am I skeptical when this group 
hollers Reverse-discrimination? Im 
skeptical because, although white males 
are about one-third of the population, 
they: 1) comprise 80 percent of the Con
gress; 2) make-up four-fifths of tenured 
university professors; 3) compose ninetenths of the Senate; 4) comprise ninetenths of the Forbes 400; 5) Occupy 95 
percent of all senior management posi
tions, although they constitute only 46 
percent of the American labor force.
If we examine the anti-affirmative 
action movement through this stand
point, we can see that it stems from 
upper-class white males who fear women 
and minorities will usurp their power if 
the program continues.
The assertion that affirmative action 
encourages minorities to expect less of 
themselves is also an argument which 
hides this hidden agenda. This state
ment makes anti-affirmative action pro
ponents sound like they are genuinely 
concerned with the achievement levels 
ofminorities. However, from a historical 
standpoint, upper-class white males 
have never been particularly concerned 
with the productivity and achievements 
of black folks.
Why are they so concerned now? Be
cause their status is threatened, not 
because there is actually any documented 
evidence that women and minorities ex
pect less of themselves than white males.
The rhetoric of the anti-affirmative 
action movement states that affirma
tive action perpetuates inequality in our 
country by establishing racial prefer
ences. I have heard many of its propo
nents argue that, if all of us are created 
equal why should certain groups be 
treated differently, as affirmative ac
tion encourages?
I would ask these people why, as a 
black woman living in a racist society, I
am treated differently every day of my 
life? In a perfect world there would be no 
racism or discrimination, and I would 
not have to worry about being treated 
unfairly because of the color of my skin, 
and my celebration of my culture. How
ever, the reality of my everyday exist
ence is that I do have to worry about 
being treated differently.
White people must know that blacks 
dont have a choice about being race
conscious; for us it is simply a matter of 
survival. Racism is one of this countrys 
fondest traditions, and one that will die 
slowly. Proponents of anti-affirmative 
action tell us how the world should be, 
but I want to tell you how it is. Show me 
a world without racism, and Ill show 
you a world where affirmative action is 
obsolete.
As much as I believe in affirmative 
action, as much as I believe in myself, 
the question that my cousin posed three 
years ago is still alive in me. What if 
hes right? What if I can chalk up all of 
my achievements to affirmative action? 
What if the sum of my personality is only 
my blackness? I sometimes ask myself.
I sometimes think that if it wasnt for 
the program, I would know, for certain 
when I am being rewarded for my 
achievements rather than my race.
It is then that I realize that I cannot 
blame affirmative action for the manner 
in which my race is beaten over my head, 
every day. I cannot blame affirmative 
action for the fact that I am black, and 
that, excepting my sex, this facet of my 
identity plays a larger role in my daily 
interactions than any other. I cannot 
blame affirmative action for the fact| 
that my cousin will never really under
stand my position or experience.
All of us must not make the mistake of I 
blaming affirmative action for the rac
ism that pervades our culture. If any
thing, this movement has enabled people 
of many different races and backgrounds 
to come together to work and study. The 
context for this learning was impossible 
during any other time in our history. If 
we are ever to understand and ulti
mately live together, it is imperative 
that we begin the real work of being 
honest with each other.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  5 September 1995
Life sucks, then you 
die, says columnist
Matt Ball
Raising a daughter in this society, I 
find myself faced with many ideas of 
tradition. The word tradition has posi
tive connotations, implying a regard for 
the ways of ancestors, an esteem for how 
things were done in the past. In spite of 
the many social movements in the past 
century, society still indoctrinates chil
dren with values dependent upon gen
der. Males (the default gender for strang
ers when meeting a baby, no matter how 
pink the outfit) are generally taught to 
be more aggressive, independent, and to 
base their self-esteem on personal 
achievement. Females are more fre
quently taught, subtly or overtly, to take 
a secondary role, to judge themselves by 
their physical attractiveness. These at
titudes continue to permeate the eti
quette of interaction between the sexes 
throughout adult life. Despite the im
pact of the feminist movement in recent 
decades, chivalry still exists and is widely 
accepted, even expected, by many men 
and women.
Because many facets of our lives are 
simply programmed responses rather 
than independently formed decisions, it 
is hard to believe we are beings with 
free will. In spite of the tremendous 
cultural changes wrought by technologi
cal advances, the pattern of successive 
generations is remarkably similar to 
those of their parents. How many of us 
believe in the god of our parents, and 
their parents before, as if our family line 
had a monopoly on the nature of the 
universe? How many of us had prayers 
drilled into us so often that we can recite 
them without any thought as to what 
they were intended to mean? How many 
of us spent years learning the names of 
every President and the dates of past 
battles (even when new ones raged un
questioned)? How many of us will go
through the expected amount of school 
to get a nine-to-five job for the next 40 or 
50 years?
As if we would starve to death other
wise, we acquire wealth and security 
as we acquire years, leaving for our 
survivors the material possessions ac
cumulated over decades and a scrap
book of photos which, except for the 
faces, could be interchanged with those 
of any number of families. When time 
runs out, thousands of dollars are spent 
to house our lifeless forms in carved 
mahogany boxes buried beneath en
graved stone markers. The money spent 
does not show any respect for the memory 
of the deceased, and could in fact be put 
to constructive use - but tradition has 
its demands. The sanctity of the dead 
outweighs the needs of the living.
Our existences have become mindless 
routines. We allow ourselves to be ab
sorbed into some collective amoeba 
rather than taking the opportunity to 
examine and judge our own lives and 
react accordingly. Few ever try to see 
beyond the constraints imposed by pre
vious generations, to explore options 
besides those given societal approval. 
Our sense of morality, our daily pat
terns, our interactions with other people 
and animals - whom we ogle, whom we 
hate, whom we keep as pets, whom we 
eat - have been pinned to us in assembly-line fashion. We have become living 
exercises in mass-production.
While the process of life itself has 
proven resilient and perhaps unending, 
our individual lives are not. Each of us 
has a relatively short span of time to 
discover and experience our unique ex
istence. We can decide for ourselves what 
course our lives will take, what we con
sider right or wrong, and what is the 
proper way to interact with our sur
roundings. Doing so in the face of so 
much cultural momentum can be quite 
intimidating, since most people regard 
such individualism with indifference at 
best. But to ignore the challenge is noth
ing less than tragic.

Freshmen aptly warned
James Stepanek
Ah, yes, its another year at CMU. 
Given that Ive been here so long (dont 
ask), Ive decided that imparting a bit of 
wisdom to the freshlings might be a good 
idea. Let me give you the simple truth 
about CMU: it isnt easy.
O.K., I supposeyoure telling yourself, 
So, whats your point? I already knew 
that. No, you dont know what its 
really like. CMU has a very respected 
reputation in industry and academia for 
the simple reason that its bloody tough 
to get through.
A friend of mine whos been applying 
to graduate schools nation wide has been 
told that a 2.0 at CMU is pretty much 
equivalent to a 3.0 elsewhere. This might 
just give you an idea of what this place is 
like.
If the Marquis De Sade were to design 
an educational institution, it would be 
CMU. Well, actually that may be a bit 
harsh, but not too harsh. Every year 
they sell T-shirts on campus with a pic
ture of the CMU logo squashing people. 
This isnt far off the mark.
Normally, universities these days tend 
to have mercy on the undergrads and try 
to make up for any deficiencies in their 
high school education. Dont expect that 
here at all. You are thrown right into the 
water and better know how to swim, 
caus e if you dont, theyll let you sink. W e 
dont have a 33% attrition rate for noth
ing.
O.K., nowthat Ive scared you enough, 
I suppose I should give you some reason 
for having somebody funnel over $20,000 
per year for this place. Well Ive already 
mentioned the reputation. I know a large 
number of people who have been quite 
successful out of here in spite of QPAs 
well below a 3.0, which usually acts as 
the dividing line. I could mention the 
pride angle. If you do manage to claw 
your way through this place (in four 
years if youre truly psychotic), you will 
know you can take an extremely large
measure of pressure.
Of course these long range perks may 
not have that much appeal right now, 
but theres other things. This place does 
have its bright spots. No, I dont mean 
the ones in front of your eyes from star
ing at a book too long. I found that while 
they do work you hard here, you gener
ally make up for it by playing hard. 
Parties here are usually quite good. Even 
if you have no desire to join a Greek 
house, this should be no disincentive to 
partake of some free partying while you 
are a freshman. In fact, I would say 
youd have to be a fool to deny yourself 
all the goodies these people are willing 
to throw at you. Free food, free liquid 
refreshment, who could ask for more. 
Also, dont forget, even if you do blow 
them off in the end there are no hard 
feelings. Its part of the system.
Aside from the Greeks, there are a 
multitude of campus organizations to 
cater to whatever floats your boat. There 
will be something which suits everyone. 
These organizations offer club sports, 
political organizations, and even groups 
which promote activities such as 
paintball or gaming. Most of these are 
funded by an activity fee which you 
have, by administrative fiat, already 
paid for.
Of course, coming down to my favorite 
obsession, theres always Carnival. This 
is the biggest, craziest, wildest party of 
the year. It comes about in April, but if 
you are in one of the associated competi
tions, it starts much earlier. There is a 
thing called the buggy race, which is my 
fixation, and there is the booth competi
tion (ho-hum). These both inspire people 
to grand levels of excessive effort in the 
spirit of fun and competition.
Carnival will give you cause to con
sider staying at CMU, even if the rest 
doesnt.
Now, for the most important piece of 
advice: be a part of something. You may 
have noticed that every one of the bright 
spots that will appear in the near term 
are associated with some form of organi
zation.

Fear and reality of rapist calls campus to action
Kristine Hinrichs
What would you do if a man put a gun 
to your head and said he was going to 
rape you?
This thought doesnt occur to most 
men, but women live with the fear of 
rape every day of their lives. Rape is one 
of the most frightening horrors I can 
imagine. When I was little, I had an 
escape route in case of a fire, I knew 
what to do if there was a tornado, and I 
had my own little plan if we were being 
robbed. In all, I felt pretty safe. I had 
everything covered. I dont feel that way 
any more.
Its a sultry 2:30 am in the middle of 
July, and a rape occurred two nights 
before down the street. I cant sleep. I 
think, What would I do? What would I 
do? A gun would be pointed at my head. 
I wouldnt be able to scream, I wouldnt 
be able to fight. Though I live on the
second floor  at 2:30 am, alone in my 
room, I think  he could climb on the 
balcony railing, scale the wall, walk on 
the tiny ledge, and come in through my 
(at the time) screenless window. What 
would I do? All the rapes had occurred 
between three and five in the morning. I 
fell back to sleep around 5:30 am. This 
was the nightly ritual for a week and a 
half wake up at 2:30 am, fall back to 
sleep at 5:30 am.
It might sound paranoid to those who 
have never had fear hit themit m akes 
your mind race, your heart pound, and 
you feel a complete sense of powerless
ness. What would I do?
Most would think Im pretty calm about 
the mad rapist on the loose. Friends of 
mine were sleeping over at other peoples 
places, some carried mace, and many 
were talking about it a lot. I think I was, 
and still am, pretty calm. I cant live in 
fear; I cant stop trusting people. Bad 
things happen. I could die in a car acci
dent tomorrow. Yet when I go running 
in Schenley Park at dusk, I cant help 
but feel nervous if there arent a lot of
people around. I look at a runner or a, 
passerby and think, Does he match the 
campus police description of the rapist? 
I also realized he doesnt have to match 
the campus police description. He could 
be anyone.
I wonder if men understand the fear of 
rape. Around the same time that the 
rapes were occuring, I went to a party 
and danced innocently with someone 
who seemed like a lot of fun. He offered 
to walk me home when I wanted to leave 
and couldnt find my friend. With the 
rapist on my mind; I thought accepting 
his offer was a wise decision.
Walking back with him, he seemed 
like a nice guy; he was funny and enter
taining. When we reached my place I 
thought it would be the nice and the 
courteous thing to invite him in. Little 
did I know, he took my invitation as 
something else.
When I realized this, I said, Please 
leave. Thinking, Hes three times my 
size.
Oh, come on, he said.
Please leave, I said. I though to
myself, The phone is by my hand; I can 
call the police.
Let me stay just for an hour, he said.
Please leave! I tightened my voice. 
Thinking, There are people in the house; 
I can scream.
You dont really mean that, he said.
Get out, I said firmly.
Fine. I guess it belongs it you. Thats 
what he last said to me. It being my 
body, I can only assume.
This man probably has no idea how 
scary the situation was to me. It angers 
me that he was so angry to leave.
It angers me that I had to think back 
to my actions: Did I encourage him? 
Maybe I shouldnt have let him in. Maybe 
I shouldnt have let him walk me home. 
Maybe I should just go home and live 
with my parents: I have a plan in case of 
a fire; I know what to do if theres a 
tornado; I have a scheme in case of a 
burglary.

Tartans stomp Diplomats with big fourth quarter
By DARREN CHIAPPETTA
Tartan Staffwriter
Call it a two-headed monster. Call it a 
platoon. Call it what you want, but make 
sure you call it by its most important 
name  victory. Senior quarterbacks 
Dave Soltysik and Keith Dickerson led a 
balanced offensive attack and junior in
side linebacker Ray Ardire spearheaded 
a strong defensive effort, which included 
a pass interception return for a touch
down by junior cornerback Nate Mor
gan, as Carnegie Mellon opened its 1995 
season with a 27-8 victory over Franklin 
& Marshall at Gesling Stadium.
There are very few question marks 
when talking about this years edition of 
Tartan football. Of the 22 opening-day 
starters, 18 have either been starters or 
part-time starters prior to this season. 
However, the one position which had 
everyone wondering was quarterback, 
where CMU lost Chris Dee, a four-year 
starter and one of the most prolific 
passers in school history. But Soltysik 
and Dickerson, who alternated series on 
Saturday, both performed effectively.
Soltysik, whose previous experience 
had included one start last season when 
Dee was injured, was 3 for 11 passing for 
60 yards. He ran for 58 more, and engi
neered two of the three Tartan offensive 
scoring drives. Dickerson, who threw 
the ball only five times all of last season, 
went 6 for 9 for 87 yards in the air, while 
running for 37 and leading the team to 
its first touchdown of the game.
On a beautiful Saturday afternoon, 
the Tartans won the opening coin toss. 
They chose to defer and let their defense 
do the job early. The centerpiece of that 
defense was Ardire, a junior who had 
been penciled in as the starter last sea
son before a shoulder injury sidelined 
him for all of1994. He did not disappoint 
in his return, making tackles on two of 
the first five Franklin & Marshall plays 
from scrimmage.
Franklin & Marshall was forced to 
punt, and, following "the kick, Soltysik 
went to work, leading CMU from its own 
36 to the F&M 47, where the drive stalled. 
After F&M had three plays and another 
punt, the Tartan quarterback moved
the ball to the 24 of the Diplomats, 
where, on fourth and one, he was sacked 
for an eight-yard loss.
Dickerson was up next for Carnegie 
Mellon, and after another strong show
ing from the Tartan defense, he moved 
the Tartans from its own 16 down to the 
F&M 14. The drive was keyed by strong 
running from seniors Mike Mathias and 
Lee Anton and a 24-yard completion 
from Dickerson to sophomore receiver 
Ricco Parrish. However, the drive, which 
began near the end of the first quarter 
and chewed up 6:08 on the clock, came
of the game to senior Tartan return man 
Rob Locke, who brought it back to his 
own 27 yard line.
At that point, Dickerson led CMU on a 
most impressive drive. Mixing pass and 
run well, the Tartans took 12 plays to go 
73 yards, capped by Mathias nine-yard 
touchdown run which put the Tartans 
on top, 7-0.
For the half, Mathias had eight car
ries for 45 yards and a touchdown, while 
Anton was the workhorse, gaining 40 
yards on 12 rushes. Dickerson was 5 of 6 
passing for 83 yards. Meanwhile, F&Ms
self, rushing for 29 yards in three carries 
and taking the team from its own 22 to 
the Diplomats 12 before a failed fourthdown conversion turned the ball back 
over to F&M.
The defense did its job on the next 
series, and Soltysik and his offensive 
mates were the beneficiaries, as they 
had to move only 36 yards to pick up 
their second score of the afternoon. A 26- 
yard completion from Soltysik to Mathias 
on a third and six play highlighted the 
drive. The Tartans missed the extra 
point but led, 13-0 with 4:28 remaining

up empty as kicker Todd Smith missed 
a 31-yard field goal. Smith fell and was 
slightly injured on the play.
Perhaps the busiest man on the field 
in the first half was Diplomat punter 
Jon Bushey. With 8:10 left in the second 
quarter, Bushey booted his fourth kick
Andy Surtz ran the ball seven times for 
38 yards, and freshman quarterback 
Mike Higgins, completed 4 of 7 throws 
for 28 yards.
Soltysik opened the second half for the 
Tartans, and did most of the work of 
Carnegie Mellons opening drive by him
in the third quarter.
It stayed that way until late in the 
stanza, when a freak play gave F&M its 
first points of the game. After a CMU 
drive in their own territory failed to net 
a first down, junior punter Frank 
Triggiani set up inside his own 20-yard
line to punt the ball back to the Diplo
mats. But Triggiani never got the chance 
as long snapper T. J. Sharpes snap went 
well over his head. Triggiani scooped it 
up at about the one-yard line, and rather 
than risk a blocked punt or a fumble, hesmartly ran the ball out of the back of 
the end zone for a two-point safety and a 
13-2 Tartan lead.
The safety, which came with :45 left in 
the third quarter, seemed to fire up the 
Diplomats, who seemed to be in need o 
such a boost. After F&Ms offense was 
unable to move the ball on its possession 
following the safety free kick, their de
fense forced only the second CMU punt 
of the afternoon, which was downed by, 
the Tartans at F&Ms seven-yard line.
From there, new quarterback Beau 
Eckert authored an 11-play, 93-yard 
drive, with the Diplomats scoring on a 
15-yard pass from Eckert to receiver 
Mark Sematinger. The two-point con
version failed, but with 7:48 to play in 
the game, CMU saw its lead shrink to 
13-8. The ensuing kickoff went out of 
bounds, giving the Tartans the ball at 
their own 35, setting up an interesting 
situation. All week, the coaching staff 
had talked about how talented both quar
terbacks were. The only unknown, they 
said, was how each would respond un
der game pressure. With CarnegieMellon facing a now-inspired F&M de
fense, the pressure fell squarely on the 
shoulders of Soltysik, who was taking 
his series in the rotation set up by offen
sive coordinator Rich Erdelyi.
Soltysik answered the call, with right 
arm and both legs. He completed his 
only pass of the drive, an 18-yarder, to 
Casey Smith, a play on which Smith 
made a beautiful diving catch. Soltysik 
also rushed for 20 yards on the drive.
All this set up a third and five at the 
F&M 23-yard line and the biggest play 
of the game.
Junior running back Buck Neel had 
only carried the ball three times for 14
- yards in the first half, and hadnt touched 
it at all in the second. But if Neel was 
rusty, he certainly didnt show it. Com
ing from the right wingback position, he 
took the handoff from Soltysik coming [

Mens soccer aiming high again this season
By RICK SIMMONS
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Last year, the mens soccer team chalked 
up its 14th consecutive winning season 
and a trip to the NCAA Division HI play
offs, while finishing second place in the 
UAA. Looking to match that feat, if not 
better it, the Tartans must overcome a 
few obstacles. The first is size.
Were physically small. Our biggest 
player is our goalkeeper, says Coach Nick 
Gaudioso, speaking of freshman Brad 
McNutt. While size in the net can be 
important, it is also useful in the field. 
And this year, it just wont be there.
A bigger problem than the lack of size, 
Gaudioso believes, is the loss of team 
leaders. While the Tartans have lost five 
starters, UAA rivals like Washington, 
Rochester, and Brandeis have lost few to 
none. Gaudioso says masters student 
midfielder Chuck Kuba is the loudest in 
a quiet group of upperclassmen.
He will look to Kuba and also to the only 
scoring powers returning from last year, 
sophomore midfielder Jason Buelow and 
junior forward Akira Imai, to step it up 
and provide the needed leadership.
Gaudioso will also expect leadership 
and goal production from 5th-year senior 
midfielder Jeff McJunkin, who was 
redshirted last year due to injury but has 
turned in three excellent years before.
Gaudioso waits not only for 
the upperclassmen to come 
around, but for the freshmen to 
do so also. In our first few scrim
mages, they made freshmenmistakes, but they learn quickly.
He credits this to the large 
amount of talent that exists in 
the 11 or 12 new members on 
this years team.
We are lucky to live in and do 
most of our recruiting from the 
east; there is a lot of soccer tal
ent in this region, Gaudioso 
says, noting that four freshmen 
will start. Along with McNutt in
goal, Harry Ulrich will start at forward and 
Peter Truong will start at sweeper.
One final spot, the left midfield position, 
will be fought for by freshmen Will Smayda 
and Dan Brody. Smayda has a nagging knee 
injury that flares up and bothers him after 
about 30 minutes of play. Brody is therefore 
more likely to get the start, but both will get 
playing time.
While the Tartans have their obstacles, 
they also have their assets  what the 
players give up in size they regain in speed. 
One might worry that the players will be 
easily muscled off the ball. Maybe so, but 
their speed should allow them to get to the 
ball first and put it out of the reach of the 
other team.
The teams strong drive will be a deciding 
factor in their success this season. Pre
dicted to finish third in the UAA, Gaudioso 
says they will nevertheless make a run for 
the top because they are so competitive, 
employing a never-say-die ethic of play.
And who canforget the impact of Gaudioso 
himself? Coming into this year with a CMU 
coaching record of 136-68-17 and an over
all coaching record of 170-90-24, . he has 
coached the Tartans for 14 seasons, each 
one finishing with a winning record.
So with speed, drive, and strong coaching 
on the side of the Tartans, and strong lead
ership from the upperclassmen players to 
come soon, they should expect another win
ning season and playoff berth, too.

New coach inherits successful womens soccer program
By PAUL BOOTHE
Tartan Assistant Sports Editor
Ranked fourth in a preseason poll 
of UAA soccer coaches, the womens 
soccer team has eight starters re
turning from last years squad, which 
had a 4-1-1 record in the UAA, and 
went 13-3-2 overall. Leading the team 
will be senior forward Nicole Poisson, whose performance last year 
earned her first team All-UAA and 
third team All-Mid-East region hon
ors. Poisson totaled a team-high 32 
points last year (13 goals, six as
sists).
Workingin combination with Pois
son will be sophomore forward Kim 
Umeda, who racked up 10 points 
(three goals, four assists) last sea
son. The Tartans retain a strong 
midfield presence with the return of 
midfield juniors Alyssa Newman and 
Mae Hogan. Newman had 24 points 
(10 goals, four assists) and earned 
second team All-UAA, while Hogan 
earned 15 points (four goals, seven 
assists). Senior midfielder Maria 
Casella and junior defender Marla 
Spontak also return to contribute to 
the teams strong defense.
Coach Ann Haggerty is very opti
mistic about the upcoming season. 
She believes that the offense has the 
ability to turn the ball quickly and 
get shots off, and she is confident in 
the ability of the sweepers to move 
the ball forward.
Freshmen to watch this season 
include goalkeeper Lindsay Smith, 
defender Tracy Burton, and 
midfielder s/forwards Cathy Duda, 
and Allison Higgins.
Last Tuesday, the Tartans faced 
off against Duquesne in a pre-season 
scrimmage and lost 4-0. According 
to Haggerty, the team was nervous 
in the first half and didnt play up to 
their potential, but played much 
stronger in the second half. She said, 
It gives me great confidence going 
into the first game that we got this
nervousness out.
This season,
Haggerty replaces 
former coach Julie 
Shackford, who 
resigned in Febru
ary to become head 
womens coach at 
Princeton.
Haggerty herself 
comes from an im
pressive back
ground in Division 
III womens soccer.
She graduated 
from William 
Smith College in 
1993 with a B.A. 
in art history. In 
college, Haggerty 
was a midfielder/ 
forward for the 
womens soccerteam and she was Gustavo Sganzerla/Tartan Photo Staff

she set single-season records with 44 
points and 20 goals, and scored the 
winning goal in the Division III 
Championship game against California-San Diego in the third over

ketball Player of the Year. She holds 
United States Soccer Federation C 
and D licenses, and comes here 
after coaching a season at Hamilton 
College where the Continentals had 
a 7-7. record, their best since 1991.
When asked about CMU, Haggerty 
said, I love it, its a great school, it 
has lots of energy.... The players have 
been unbelievably helpful. They 
know what they want from the game, 
and they go after it.
This past weekend, the team 
opened the season with games 
against Denison University on Sat
urday, and Ohio-Wesleyan on Sun
day. The Tartans lacked confidence
in their first match-up, and lost 3-0. 
But the team came back the next day 
and took a 1-0 win. Umeda scored the; 
game-winning goal against Denison! 
off of an assist from junior midfielder' 
Jill Sincaglia. Smith did very well in 
goal, making 28 saves and getting her 
first career shutout.
Haggerty said, In the second game,! 
we challenged the ball well.... We were* 
a completely different team which! 
showed a lot of potential. In the firstl 
game, we didnt play smart or hard.'
Defense was a big part of the' 
weekends games, as Haggerty said,! 
Nicole [Poisson] worked really hard' 
both games. We were able to win the>

The city of Cleveland, offen
sively called The Mistake by the 
Lake by the Pittsburgh PostGazette, and their beloved Browns 
will celebrate a divisional crown 
this year over Pittsburgh and the 
Steelers. This, of course, is my 
opinion and will happen when 
(my opinion again) Browns quar
terback Vinny Testaverde gets 
injured and is replaced by rookie 
Eric Zeier.

the San Diego Chargers, will win

On Saturday, the CMU women's ten
nis team traveled to Bethany College 
and started out the season with a win, 
with a final score of 9-0. Freshman Keri 
Mills won 6-0, 6-0; freshman Karin 
Tuxen won 6-2, 6-4; freshman Jilian 
Watkins won 6-0, 6-0, senior Namita 
Amin won 6-1, 6-2; junior Michelle 
Cook won 6-4, 6-2; and freshman 
Miklane Fedorowich won 6-1, 7-5. 
Fedorowich putin an impressive match, 
as she was down 2-5 at one point and 
had to win five straight games to close 
out the set. In doubles play, Mills and 
Watkins won 6-2, 6-2; freshman Julie 
Balch and Tuxen won 6-2, 7-5; and 
,Cook and Amin won 7-5, 6-1.
On Thursday, former U.S. and French 
Open champion Hie Nastase teamed 
up with his godson, sophomore Dan 
Bilco, against Carnegie Mellon Head 
Tennis Coach Peter Moss and sopho, more Navroze Marshall. The event, held 
on the CMU tennis courts, benefited 
CMU's men's and women's tennis 
teams, as well as the Tennis Patrons

in the middle of their defense, 
good things will happen for this

Joe Montana and Denver, Oak

head coaches.
AFC East fans should enjoy the 
race to the top, as Indianapolis 
and New England continue 
to improve and Miami and 
Buffalo try to hold on to the 
past. The Patriots are my pick 
because of Drew Bledsoes 
arm. If Bledsoe or his arm 
cannot play for an extended 
period of time this season, 
look for Miami to emerge.
Oakland, Miami, andPittsburgh should all make Wild 
Card playoff berths. Each has 
been penciled in for the Su

ties in previous years, but 
none have been there in some 
time. Speaking of Super
Bowls, the last team to win a 
Super Bowl for the AFC was the

Gridiron Grapevine
by Steve Charnoubi
The NFL season has begun. 
This year we will see new faces in 
new places, as the Jacksonville 
Jaguars and Carolina Panthers 
take the field, and old faces in 
even older places, as the Raiders 
return to Oakland and the Rams 
move to St. Louis.
The NFC West clearly belongs 
to the 49ers. Losing Ricky Watters 
hurts them, but not enough for 
them to lose the division title 
theyve held for 10 of the last 12 
seasons. The Atlanta Falcons are 
their greatest threat, with Jeff 
George now leading a renovated 
run-and-shoot offense. The New
Orleans Saints have a decent 
team and have had some key ac
quisitions, like all-pro comerback 
Eric Allen, but their defense has 
yet to come together. The St. Louis 
Rams are still the same old team, 
despite a new location. As usual 
the offense remains one-dimen
sional, with Jerome Bettis carry
ing most of the load. The Caro
lina Panthers are exactly where 
they should be, at the bottom. 
Dont expect more than two wins 
from the Panthers.
The NFC Central will provide 
one of the closest races this year. 
The Minnesota Vikings have a 
potent offense with Warren Moon 
and Chris Carter leading it, and 
their defense (although depleted 
due to free-agency) should still be 
able to keep the team in games. 
The Lions still have an offense 
led by Barry Sanders and a de
fense led Cris Spielman, but De
troit still has a team led by Wayne 
Fontes. The Green Bay Packers 
have lost their biggest weapon in
Sterling Sharpe, and have done 
nothing in the off-season but lose 
players to free agency. Tampa 
Bay is on the rise, but they are 
still a couple of seasons away 
from being a serious contender. 
The Chicago Bears had a fluke 
season last year. Dont expect the 
same results from this group of 
over-achievers that benefited 
from an easy schedule.
The Philadelphia Eagles were 
7-2 last year before they hit a 
seven game losing streak. The 
offense has greatly improved due 
to the West Coast offense rookie 
coach Ray Rhodes has introduced, 
and the defense is better than it 
was last year. Look for the Eagles 
to win the division and give the 
Cowboys their biggest challenge. 
Since the day Jimmy Johnson 
decided to go fishing, the Dallas 
Cowboys have had a non-stop 
depletion of talent. The losses 
this off-season include stars Alvin 
Harper, Mark Stepnoski, and 
Please see GRAPEVINE, page 11Wild card races heat up September baseball
Suicide Squeeze
by Anuj Gupta
In the three months since we last 
spoke, much has changed in the world, 
but one problem has remained. The 
major league owners have yet to ap
point a commissioner or come to terms 
with the players union.
By the All-Star break, it appeared as 
if Major League baseball (as we know 
it) may have been one silent gasp away 
from extinction. Yet, in the midst of 
dwindling attendance, an uncertain 
future with television, and a lack of 
discernible heroes, it appears that 
baseballs saving grace may turn out to 
be what initially was labeled as a base
ball purists nightmarethe wild card 
playoff spot.
The division races came to a screech
ing halt by the middle of July. Acquisi
tions made by the Red Sox including 
Rick Aguilera andWillie McGee, helped 
distance themselves from the rest of 
the American League Eastern division 
herd. Although a recent slump has 
brought the California Angels lead 
back to single digits, their run-producing machine should prevent any major 
collapse.
That has left us not with two, not 
four, but as of September 1, six teams 
that were within four games of a play
off spot in the National League and
seven teams were within five games of the 
final American League playoff spot. Had 
the playoff system stuck to the original 
format, not only would there have been no 
reason to watch August and September 
baseball on television, but in 13 cities, 
there would have been no reason for the 
average fan to attend a game other than to 
see those promising September call-ups.
Even in cities where the playoffs are 
now a distant vision, wild card fever struck 
at one point or another. Believe it or not, 
the talented but young Pirates team was 
at one point only five games out of a wild 
card spot. After the Bucs come home from 
a successful road trip, 
consecutive series 
against the Astros and 
the Cubs had them 
primed to make a seri
ous run at the post-season.
Unfortunately, inex
perience always man
ages to shine through, 
and they faltered. How
ever, for one brief but 
inspiring moment, play
off fever was evident in 
the Burgh. The same 
held true for the Detroit 
Tigers and Florida Mar
lins as both had brief 
glimpses of the playoff 
horizon at one point.
So where does this leave us? Who are the 
contenders and who are the pretenders? 
In the American League, the Seattle Mari
ners look primed to be playing ball in 
October, with the additions of Andy Benes, 
resurgent Norm Charlton and the return 
of Junior.
Of course one cannot overlook the re
cently hot, then slumping, and now hot
again, New York Yankees. David Cone ing pitchers, and the best lead-off hitter in

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  5 September 199511
Football team opens 
season with a win
FOOTBALL, continued from page 9
left, made a move that left a de
fender grasping for air, then low
ered his head, picking up 11 yards 
on the play and allowing the 
crowd of 1,851 at Gesling to let 
out a collective sigh.
On the next play, Mathias 
rambled 12 yards for his second 
score of the day, and after a 2- 
point conversion run by Soltysik, 
the Tartan lead opened up to 21- 
8 with two minutes to go.
The defense put the exclama
tion point on 20 seconds later 
when Morgan, who intercepted 
three passes in one game last 
season, picked off a heavily-pressured Eckert and returned it 15
yards for the final points.
For the game, Mathias and 
Anton each carried the ball 21 
times, with Mathias gaining 97 
yards and Anton 72. In addition, 
Mathias, along with Parrish, led 
the team with three receptions 
each. On defense, Ardire had 12 
tackles, including 10 solos, and 
the team limited F&M to only 
200yards. Junior Todd McManus 
forced a fumble.
The Tartans are set to take on 
perhaps their biggest challenge 
of the season next week as they 
host Allegheny College, tradi
tionally one of the strongest pro
grams in Division III.
The game begins at 7 pm.
NFL predictions offered
PUNDIT, from page 10
AFC and a Super Bowl berth, 
j It is my prediction that the 
entire NFC East will make the 
playoffs this year, with the ex
ception of the Washington 
Redskins. They will play the role 
of a sacrificial lamb to the rest of 
the division. Led by Dallas, our 
nations capitol will be trounced 
and treated most unpatriotically 
as they go winless in divisional 
play. The Redskins can look for
ward to at least 10 losses.
The Tampa Bay Buccaneers 
set an NFL record last season 
with their 12th-straight 10-loss 
season. They accomplished this 
while every other team in the 
NFC Central made the playoffs. 
However, I think history will 
reverse itself and the new-look 
Bucs have what it takes to make, 
that 10 wins this season; enough 
to win the Central. Tampa Bay 
will lose their first two games, 
hut will field a much more com
petitive team than in years past.
When the San Francisco 49ers 
\ake the field this season, it will 
be without leading rusher Ricky 
'Watters, and the first-round 
draft picks from the last two 
years, William Floyd and J.J. 
Stokes. That matters little 
though, because their first two 
games are against divisional 
dopes New Orleans and Atlanta. 
Watters will no longer be missed 
once Floyd and Stokes are 
healthy for week three against 
highly-hyped New England.
The defending Super Bowl 
.champions, also the only NFC 
West team with a winning record 
last year, will win the division 
easily.
The NFC Championship and 
Super Bowl can be summed up 
in two words: Deion Sanders. 
Sanders was the difference in 
San Franciscos title quest last 
year and holds the keys to suc, cess this time around too. Which 
ever team signs him will win.
Sanders has at least six more 
weeks of baseball left, but has 
said he wants to decide by Sep
tember 8. For Sanders, it could 
be a question of love or money. 
I believe that Deion will go to 
Dallas because of money and 
the fact that owner Jerry Jones 
has promised Sanders, who is 
an all-pro comerback and last 
seasons defensive player of the 
year, an offensive position. Jones 
is drastically restructuring 
player contracts to afford Sand
ers and Dallas is the most mar
ketable team in the NFL, selling 
24.3 percent of all NFL mer
chandise last year. Thats over 
three times more than any other 
team.
Dont count San Fran out yet 
 they might snatch him up 
before Dallas ever gets a sa}' in 
the matter. Sanders plays base
ball in San Francisco, admits to 
sharing a bond with the 49ers, 
and his agent has been meeting 
with 49er officials recently to 
sketch out a deal. Will Deion 
leave his heart in San Francisco 
in favor of fast Texas cash? Only 
time will tell.
Pickup next weeks issue for 
the Pundits primetime predic
tions and an analysis of Foxs

GRAPEVINE, from page 10
James Washington. Buddy Ryan 
is a defensive genius, but an 
offensive moron. Fortunately 
this year the Arizona Cardinals 
have two new offensive weap
ons in Dave Krieg and Rob 
Moore. The New York Giants 
have questions on both defense 
and offense, but Dan Reeves can 
find answers for all questions. 
Washington has added some 
talent to the defense, but not 
enough to keep the Redskins 
out of the cellar.
The last team to win the Su
per Bowl for the AFC was the 
Raiders. They under-achieved 
last year. This year Oakland 
will compete for the conference 
title. John Elway will get his 
chance to prove he is not ready 
to retire yet, as he will thrive in 
the Denver Broncos new offen
sive scheme brought over from 
the 49ers by Mike Shanahan. 
The Chargers got lucky last sea
son. They should have lost to 
Miami and Pittsburgh in the 
playoffs. The Seattle Seahawks 
are young, strong, and have a 
lot of potential, and all they need 
now is for new coach Dennis 
Erickson to bring them together. 
Joe Montanas gone, and so is 
the Kansas City Chiefs chance 
for a winning season this year.
Every year the Pittsburgh 
Steelers have taken a step for
ward, but this year they take a 
step sideways. Theyll win the 
AFC Central, but not much 
more. Pittsburghs biggest com
petition will come from the 
Browns. Expect a photo finish 
as the race for the AFC Central 
title proves to be the closest of 
the year. The Houston Oilers 
rebuilt their offensive line in 
the off-season, but thats about 
it, so expect a somewhat better 
performance. The Jacksonville 
Jaguars look ready enough to 
win at least three games but not 
much more. The top overall pick 
in the draft will go to Cincinnati 
for a third straight year, as the 
Bengals prepare to be the worst 
team in the NFL.
The Miami Dolphins are ready 
to take the field with one of the 
best teams theyve ever as
sembled. Shula and Marino have 
waited a long time for this Su
per Bowl,, and their time has 
come. The New England Patri
ots need to surround Bledsoe 
with offense. Marshall Faulk 
and the Colts defense should 
carry Indianapolis. The Buffalo 
Bills still havent recovered from 
their four failed Super Bowl at
tempts. Rich Kotite is the sec
ond-worst coach in the league to 
Dave Shula. The New York Jets 
have to pray they do better than 
one of the expansion teams.
Miami will end the NFCs Su
per Bowl dominance by defeat
ing San Francisco in the Super 
Bowl. Dan Marino will be the 
MVP of the 1995 season. The 
Raiders, Broncos, Steelers, 
Browns, and Patriots will make 
the AFC playoffs, and the 
Eagles, Cardinals, Cowboys, 
Vikings, and Falcons will make 
the NFC playoffs. Expansion 
95 will prove to be one of the 
most exciting seasons in years.

Tartan CC looking for best season ever
By MAX CHTTTISTER
Tartan Staffwriter
The Tartan cross-country team will be 
looking for its best season ever as it started 
its season with a crushing win over Cali
fornia University of Pennsylvannia this 
past Saturday. I think that the team will 
be much improved over last season, said 
Mens Coach Gary Meckley.
He feels that he could have the best 
Division II team in the area. We set our 
standards high.
He feels that veteran leadership will be 
provided by sophomore Adam Chase, jun
ior Ron Polcawich, junior Greg Stultz, and 
junior Sebastian Zyssler. Meckley said, I 
think if these guys run well, well have a 
respectable team. Meckley cites the teams 
youth and enthusiasm as positive factors, 
and believes that freshmen Kristo 
Kriechbaum and Brad Dollar could really 
contribute to the teams success.
Sophomore Brian Ingram said, Were 
running a lot better than we were this 
time last year. As a team, weve improved 
a lot over the summer.
The womens team is returning nine of 
their top 10 runners from last year. In 
addition, the team has gained two fresh
men, Maureen McGranaghan and Marga
ret Powers, who womens coach Dario 
Donatelli feels will crack the top seven 
this year. I have a pretty good idea how
the team looks, but Ill have a better idea 
Saturday, joked Donatelli.
The womens team is looking to improve 
after last years third-place UAA finish, only 
six points out of first place. Our team will be 
considerably better, said Donatelli. How
ever, he also pointed out that none of the 
conferences top 20 runners from last year 
graduated. He feels that the competition 
this year will be tougher than last years.
According to Donatelli, senior Melissa 
Baustert and junior Becky Buchheit should 
finish one-two this year. Buchheit said that 
this years team is probably the best one 
weve had since Ive been here. She also 
said, I spent a lot of time running this 
summer.... Well [Bausteirt and Buccheit] 
both do a lot better [than last year].
On the section,
Buchheit said 
Theres a lot of 
tough teams....
The competition 
should be the best 
its ever been for 
women.
The mens team 
dominated Cali
fornia University 
on Saturday as 
they let only one 
California runner 
crack their top 
five on the way to
the Tartans 19-48 win. Kriechbaum came in 
first, followed by Zyssler, Polcawich, junior 
Paul Hatala, and Ingram, who placed third 
through sixth respectively.
The womens team ran equally well in their 
tri-meet, defeating California University 17- 
38 and University of Pittsburgh-Johnstown 
1550. Buchheit and Baustert tied for first, 
closely followed by McGranaghan in third 
place. Sophomore Melissa Lott and junior 
Megan Day came in sixth and seventh to close 
out the top five.
Donatelli said, I was very pleased with our 
performance. The times were much quicker 
than I expected for the first meet of the sea
son.
The Tartan runners will participate in the 
California State Invitational this Saturday.

CMU social scene gets mixed review
An inside look: freshman students camp out at Hampton Inn
By LAUREN HEINZ
Tartan Editor-in-Chief
Shubo Mookexjee doesnt mind living 
out of his suitcase at the Hampton Inn 
air conditioning, an abundance of clean 
towels, and cable television make his 
temporary dorm room more than bear
able.
Mookeijee, an H&SS freshman, is one 
of about 55 students still living in the 
Hampton Inn until the Housing Office 
finds a permanent space for him on cam
pus. More than 90 students started the 
year in the Oakland hotel.
Ideally we wouldnt be in this situa
tion, said Tim Michael, the new direc
tor of campus housing. CMU is such a 
popular school that it keeps over-enrolling students. Our goal is to stay on track 
and get them to campus as soon as pos
sible.
Michael said this years room shortage 
was a combination of three factors: a 
higher number of upperclassmen sign
ing up for the lottery, a large freshman 
class, and less upperclass attrition.
To make more campus rooms avail
able, his office sent letters to upperclass
men in campus housing in July, offering 
them a full refund of their deposit if they
wanted to move off campus. Students 
were also offered a cheaper rent if they 
wanted to change their double-occupancy 
rooms into triple occupancies.
Michael said the University also pur
chased space in Webster Hall and Ca
thedral Mansions off campus to make 
room for over 1,200 first-year students.
Last year, the University rented rooms 
at the Holiday Inn, but Michael said 
CMU switched to the Hampton Inn be
cause of the hotel staffs enthusiasm. A 
free continental breakfast, daily maid 
service, and campus shuttle were also 
welcome advantages.
The rooms at the Hampton Inn are 
larger than most standard doubles on 
campus. They have two large double 
beds (some have a double bed and a foldout couch), a desk and chairs, television, 
bath and shower, and clock radio.
Students staying there can take a 
shuttle to campus every half-hour be
tween 7 am and 1 am daily. Several 
students said the drivers would take 
them to other local neighborhoods as 
well.
The three resident assistants assigned 
to the Hampton Inn have tried to make 
it look like any other residence hall.

As many freshmen enter CMU this fall, they 
begin to venture out into their own indepen
dence, which means not only finding security 
within themselves but also in their new sur
roundings. As they familiarize themselves to 
campus life, they will soon realize that life at 
CMU can be as challenging socially as it is 
academically.
While Greek life is not the only social outlet 
on campus, it plays an integral part in creating 
social unity here at CMU, said Tanya Zeblocki, 
a junior psychology major.  We have a really 
strong Greek system that allow for a variety of 
people to come together, she added.
Whether or not to join a sorority or a frater
nity is a big question for many incoming fresh
men at the beginning of the year, as they try to 
deal with their inbred stereotypes of Greeks 
and take in all the Rush paraphernalia at the 
same time.
A fraternity offers an alternative to campus 
life, explains John Dien, a senior industrial 
design major. It is also the easiest way to 
become involved in many activities such as 
Carnival and Greek Sing.
Involvement in such activities was a main 
reason that Zeblocki decided to rush a sorority 
during her sophomore year. When I first came 
to CMU I had my reservations about joining a 
sorority, but I soon realized that the majority of 
my friends here were male, and I think its 
important to get to know the other women on 
campus since we are so few in number, she 
said.
The few girls that I did know were all joining 
sororities, which made me a bit more openminded.
Yet, Zeblocki also feels that the Greek sys
tem is not always for everyone, and there are 
other ways in which to have a healthy social 
life on campus.
I encourage most girls to take part in the 
sorority Rush even if they dont plan in joining 
a sorority. Its a good way to meet other people 
who might share your interests, she said.
There are also a number of independent 
clubs and sports that can foster friendships 
and provide an outlet for stress. I played la
crosse my freshmen year, which is how I met 
many of the friends that I have now, she 
added.
I havent joined many on-campus organiza
tions at all since Fve been here, but Ive been 
lucky in that I can deal with many people in my 
studio on both an academic and social level, 
said Christine Royal, a junior architecture

Students try their hand in CMU dating game
BY SHARMILA VENKATASUBBAN
Tartan Staffwriter
Dating at Carnegie Mellon? I have one word for 
you: Nada. Unfortunately, junior H&SS student 
Lee Spuhler seems to be right on target with 
general consensus found here on campus, as far as 
love is concerned.
As.an obviously nave freshmen, I, too, came to 
college with high hopes and fairy 
tale fantasies, only to discover 
that CMU does not exactly foster 
an atmosphere in which I am to 
find the man of my dreams, ac
cording to a number of students.
So, after having abandoned any 
ambitions of finding true love, I 
figured that an occasional simple 
date would suffice; that couldnt possibly be too 
much to ask for.
Once again my navet shone through.
The problem here is that people dont date, 
explains Vanessa Novissimo, a junior professional 
writing and French major.
You either have this intense girlfriend/boyfriend 
relationship, or youre just friends. Theres no in 
between, said Novissimo.
Although Ive come to accept this fact as reality 
here at CMU, I cant help but ask: Why? Men are 
afraid of the c word [commitment], said Novissimo. 
They think that if you go out on one date, then 
youre joined at the hip, and to be honest, I know of 
very few women that really think along such lines. 
Feeling re-inspired, I believed that all we had 
here was a strong lack of communication and after 
clearing the misunderstanding, all would be fine.
When I approach a woman, she usually says, 
Get out of my life, Rudy.  
 Rudolfo Goetz-Blohm, senior physics major
As it turns out, many men arent afraid of dating 
and commitment, and for the most part they dont 
mistake one for the other.
When I approach a woman, she usually says, 
Get out of my life, Rudy,  said Rudolfo GoetzBlohm, a senior physics major.
I dated a woman for one whole year after she 
dumped me seven times, so obviously Im not 
afraid of commitment, he said.
The problem is that Goetz-Blohm seldom finds a 
woman that he is interested in dating.
I want a woman like me, because basically, I like 
myself, said Goetz-Blohm.
Wanting to help this poor boy out, I asked, what 
qualities in yourself do you want to see in a woman?
I dont believe in the random hook-up thing. 
Most girls here are only interested in sex, and that 
poses a problem for me, because Im not into that.
I mean, sometimes it happens. A 
girl could jump on top of me and 
theres nothing I can do about it, 
but generally I dont kiss girls in
discriminately, said Goetz-Blohm.
Its reasons such as these, claims 
Goetz-Blohm, that he has not had 
 one date here at CMU.
Ive been looking for a woman 
for 21 years and have yet to find one, he said.
Finding his case against CMU women to be a bit 
extreme, I explained that we happen to be in 
college and arent really ready to settle down with 
the kids as of yet.
Thats bullshit, Goetz-Blohm replied, because 
commitment does not necessarily mean marriage 
by any means.

By TRICIA DAVIS
Tartan Staffwriter
If youre tired of campus food and you 
and your friends want to try out some of 
the coolest restaurants in Pittsburgh, 
then I have some suggestions for you. 
Since I have lived in Pittsburgh most of 
my life, Ive had the opportunity to try a 
lot of the restaurants here.
Ive learned that as a CMU student, 
you dont have to travel very far for an 
enjoyable dining experience.x
Oakland
The Oakland area provides many dif
ferent types of restaurants ranging from 
fast food to casual dining.
The Original Hot Dog Shop on Forbes 
Avenue has always been a popular hang
out for Pitt and CMU students.
The food is inexpensive, but I wouldnt 
recommend going there on a Friday or 
Saturday night because it gets really 
crowded.
Primanti Brothers, also on Forbes Av
enue, offers their famous specialty sand
wiches.
Their sandwiches are stacked high 
with just about everything imaginablemeat, fries, coleslaw, cheese, you name 
it.
Oakland also offers casual dining and 
fine food. First, theres Hemingways 
Cafe on Forbes Avenue. The food is good 
and its not very expensive.
If youre the outdoors type, you have 
to check out Lewis & Clarks, situated 
right off of Bigelow Boulevard on N. 
Dithridge.
Lewis & Clarks offers a fun atmo
sphere with all kinds ofinteresting things 
decorating its walls and ceilings, such as 
mountain bikes, skis and trophies.
Finally, my almost favorite restau
rant in Oakland is Mad Mex, located on 
the comer of Atwood and Bates.
Everyone is talking about Mad Mex 
because it features the best Mexican 
food in Pittsburgh. The authentic decor 
inside really makes you feel like youre 
in Mexico. Youll have to check it out if 
you want to know more.
I will tell you that the service is excel
lent and they offer half price food every 
night between 11 pm and 1 am.
For obvious reasons, this place is al
most always packed with college stu
dents, so expect to wait about 20 min
utes for a table.
While youre waiting, those of you who 
are 21 can try a new beer from their 
large selection of cervezas at the bar.
Shadyside
Lets talk about Shadyside. The 
Shadyside area is known for its restau
rants, too. Hotlicks, Max & Ermas, and 
the Balcony all offer fun foods, sand
wiches, salads, burgers, and entrees.
The food is really good and they are all 
conveniently located in the main shop
ping area on Walnut Street.
If you like Chinese cuisine, you dont 
have to travel very far.
China Palace, also on Walnut Street, 
was named Best Chinese Restaurant 
from 199194 by Pittsburgh Magazine 
Readers Poll.
Squirrel Hill
The Squirrel Hill area satisfies any 
appetite with its variety of restaurants 
and hangouts.
Whether youre craving Italian, Chi
nese, American, or Greek food, youll 
find it on Forbes or Murray Avenue in 
Squirrel Hill.
If youre in the mood for pizza or pasta, 
there are a lot of good pizzerias, such as 
Aiellos Pizza, Mineos Pizza House, and 
Napolis.
Sichuan House Chinese Restaurant, 
on Murray Avenue is a popular place to 
dine as well.
Gulliftys on Murray Avenue serves 
lunch and dinner, and has been voted 
best desserts for 11 consecutive years.
For a more casual atmosphere, you 
can enjoy breakfast, lunch or dinner at 
Bagel Nosh, Pamelas, or Eat N* Park, 
which is open 24 hours a day.
Finally, Suzies, located off Forbes, on 
Shady Avenue, features authentic Greek 
food. I usually order their special mush
Graphic by Derek Wahila/Tartan Assistant Production Managcroom sandwich, which is absolutely de 
licious, but they wont share the recipe
South Side
Finally, if you dont mind traveling a 
little further away, you should visit East 
Carson Street in the South Side.
Besides being famous for its abun
dance of bars, the South Side is noted foi 
its many restaurants.
. Little Chicagos Pizza offers authentic 
Chicago-style pizza.
However, if you want New York-stylJ 
pizza, you can venture over to Eden Roe 
Cafe, where they also have a wide selec 
tion of specialty sandwiches.
Fat Heads is a cool place to go fo: 
sandwiches and wings. You had bette: 
have a big appetite when you go there 
because the sandwiches are huge.
My favorite restaurant in the Soutlj 
Side is Mallorca, where they offer Span-, 
ish Continental cuisine indoors or on the 
patio. The food is expensive, but ask 
anyone and theyll tell you that its well 
worth it.

Students deal with campus dating
DATING, from page LI
As a freshman there are too 
many things going on right now, 
which makes it difficult for a real 
relationship to evolve, said Dana 
Heath, a sophomore BHA major. 
Or maybe I just havent found 
the right person yet. I dont know.
For some, dating at CMU hasnt 
been a problem at all. Ive had a 
boyfriend all year, said Meredith 
Knezek, an IM sophomore. It is 
definitely possible to meet people 
and have a relationship. But a lot 
of people, especially men, are rea senior architect major. Barmada 
said, The women were repressed 
in high school, and here they have 
this newfound confidence, due to 
all the attention they get because 
of the ratio.
According to Youssef Tuma, 
senior ECE major, its a twisted 
situation on both parts. The guys 
feel repressed because of the ra
tio and can find just about any
thing attractive by this point. The 
girls, on the other hand, come 
here, and all of a sudden theyre 
really popular. She thinks that
The guys feel repressed because of 
the ratio and can find just about any
thing attractive by this point"
 Youssef Tuma, senior ECE major
ally wrapped up in their work 
and dont have time for such 
things, she said.
Since there is no real place for 
students to gather at this school,
I wondered how one would go 
about meeting other people, if 
and when they set aside time to 
do so.
If I want to meet someone, I 
find out who his friends are, said 
Roberta Rigano, a senior chemi
cal engineering major. And if I 
know any of them, I ask them to 
introduce me, she said.
Your luck at dating can be suc
cessful or not depending on what 
youre looking for in a relation
ship. A lot of people just want 
something relaxed, not so in
tense, said Rigano.
Another attack on women at 
Carnegie Mellon is that they have 
a general attitude problem. Its
shes getting a relationship, when 
in fact, thats not what he had in 
mind at all, said Tuma.
Unable to swallow the concept 
that there is sometL' ig seriously 
wrong with all the girls at CMU, 
since I happen to be a female at 
this school and a few of my friends 
happen to be female as well, I 
must wonder at why no female 
would comment on the general 
status of the men on this campus.
All in all, there are a lot of 
weird people here, claims Sherif 
Youssef, a senior ECE major.
Personally, I would consider 
this a blessing of some sort. In my 
experience, the eccentric are more 
attractive that your average per
son any day, and CMU is a haven 
for the unusual.
College is an ephemeral expe
rience, and once we accept that, 
our relations with other will fall
annoying, said Fady Barmada, into place.
Freshmen enjoy luxuries of hotel rooms

We run everything like regu

one seems well-bonded, said 
Carol Haggerty, a senior history 
major. Things are going great... 
but now that classes have started, 
many of them are anxious to get 
on campus. Fourteen students left 
today, so thats pretty good, she 
said

Kenton Shaver is a senior English maCMU offers social opportunities
SOCIAL, page LL
major.
When my friends and I hang out, 
we generally venture out into the city, 
but as for having fun on campus, the 
fraternities are the most popular pi ace 
to be, said Royal.
Although many students partici
pate in fraternities or sororities, there 
is a large majority of students who 
find ways to be socially active that are 
independent of the Greek system.
There is a lot of culture on this 
campus, much diversity, which is how 
I met people  by getting involved in 
cultural organizations, said Shelly 
Sethi, a junior biology major.
I decided that I was going to do the 
things that interested me, and take 
part in those activities. Once I did 
that, I met people who were similar to 
me, in interests and otherwise, she 
said.
Joining a sorority was never an 
option because I never felt like I needed 
that type of security, she said.
Tahmin Clark, a senior in CIT, does 
not believe that the University sup
ports the diversity that Sethi enjoys.
For ethnic groups or minorities, 
CMU has little to offer. This is because 
the people who have the authority and 
power to decide the events that occur 
at CMU are not diverse themselves. 
This is exemplified by what movies 
are shown (there are no black movies 
scheduled in DH 2210 this semester), 
and the bands and live perfomances at 
Carnival, he said.
Cultural groups such as ASA (Asian
Students Association), KSA (Korean 
Students Association), Spirit, and 
SHIPE (Society of Hispanic Engi
neers), and the Spanish House are 
almost the only support systems that 
these students have. Without them, 
minority life at CMU would be un
bearable. Its rough too, because these 
groups dont get a lot of funding from 
the University, said Clark.
For Diana Bartolotta, a sophomore 
psychology major, freshman orienta
tion helped her branch out and meet a 
wide range of people.
After that [orientation], the organi
zations that I became involved with, 
such as Scotch TNSoda, allowed me to 
create personal relationships, she 
said.
I think that theres definitely a so
cial scene if you go into the city and 
seek it out, but its pretty easy to get 
stuck hanging out with the same group 
of people if you dont, said Stephanie 
Palmer, a junior directing major.
I go to parties, bar-hopping, explore 
Shadyside and Squirrel Hill for fun.... 
I think that the fraternity parties are 
fun for the people involoved in the 
Greek system. Personally, I can only 
take so many drank people at one 
time, and then its like OK, this is 
getting old,  she said.
Carnegie Mellon has many oppor
tunities in the way of fun, for the 
culturally aware, said Brian Ingram, 
a sophomore engineer.
There are a plethora of musicals, 
and art exhibits if you are interested 
in such events, he said.

Body art pierces through mainstream
By DAWN WALLHAUSEN & ANGELA MOLLOY
Tartan Staffwriters
Lindsay Prajza, sophomore IDS major, has 23 
body piercings. She has 11 in each ear and one in her 
navel. With the exception of her navel and the first 
three holes in each ear, she has done all of her own 
piercings. She did not use ice, she just stuck a safety 
pin right through.
I like the idea of adorning the body with piercings 
said Ryan Douglass, a junior in the art department. 
He has a septum (center cartilage of the nose) ring, 
and one nipple ringthe other nipple piercing grew 
back.
A few years back, a boy with an earring was a big 
deal. Then, he might have carefully considered 
which ear his one piercing would have gone into, 
depending on the statement he wanted to make. 
Almost unfailingly, the new jewelry would shock,, 
even offend authority figures, and intrigue peers.
Today, one tiny hoop through the ear goes practi
cally unnoticed. Now the way to make a statement 
is through the nose, navel, nipple, tongue, lip, and 
even genitals.
Keith Roman, a piercer at Helion House Incorpo
rated, located in the Strip District, has 22 such 
piercings. Indeed, Roman seems to have covered all 
the bases with pierced ears, tongue, eyebrow, erle 
(bridge of the nose), septum, nostrils, labret (lower 
lip), nipples, and genitals.
Roman admits that some of his adornments make 
life more difficult for him. The tongue piercing 
takes a while to get used to, he said. He recom
mended taking aspirin and sucking on ice to reduce 
swelling, as well as avoiding crunchy foods for a 
while. You may also need to learn how to talk again, 
he said.
According to Roman, body piercing began to pen
etrate the American public in the 1970s out in San 
Francisco. Over the past five years, and the last yearPhoto courtesy Tharunka
and a half in particular, the piercing fad has 
skyrocketed. Everything gets into the mainstream 
eventually, said Douglass, who isnt bothered by 
the rise in popularity of body piercing. He feels 
that now that body piercing is part of popular 
culture, it will stay there.
Does that hurt? is one of the most typical 
reactions H&SS freshman Lisa Kleinman gets to 
her nose and labret piercings. Of course, isnt this 
the question on everyones mind? A needle through 
the tongue, the lip, the genitals  could it possibly 
not hurt?
Piercings arent really painful, Kleinman said. 
The lip gave me a really weird feeling throughout 
my whole body. A person isnt used to having 
something poked through their body, but it wasnt 
painful in any sense.
Douglass said the actual piercings hurt but that 
afterwards you get the endorphins.
If body piercings hurt and get in the way, then 
why get it done? Roman said that despite the 
problems they may cause, his tongue piercings are 
pretty much for better oral sex and shock value. 
But reasons vary.
Sophomore creative writing major Benjamin 
Kroh said that he got his eyebrow pierced because 
he broke up with his girlfriend. Kroh added that 
his piercing was part of a series of symbolic ges
tures which included cutting and dyeing his hair.
Sophomore LCS major Christine Allard said 
that she got her navel ring, quite simply, be
cause. She also said that she flirted to get it done 
free, so the price was right.
Prajza said, I think its attractive, its original, 
its individualistic, but it doesnt scream Hey, look 
at me! Its my own thing, said Prajza. She also 
said what piercing doesnt mean for her. Just 
because you have your body adorned doesnt mean 
Please see PIERCING, page Lll
Sophomore Allie King exposes a classic navel ring. You cant see her nose ring in this photo, but check 
out her Snoopy doll just a bit over to the right.
Remember when your Cabbage Patch Kid got a cast if you did? Now, Snoopy is getting into the 
scene. Perhaps we can hope to see Charlie Brown with some extra holes in his body sometime 
in the near future.

Systems Manager
The Tartan Newspaper is on the lookout for a new systems 
manager. We reckon the job means software and hardware 
buyin; hookin up and fixing em; training the local'folk; 
an troubleshooting them pesky computers.
If youve got a good head under your hat (10 gallon pre
ferred), you can join the Tartan Editorial Board, have com
plete access to the office computers, and get lots o loot. So 
round up them wagons an head on over to Student Center 
Room 104. Boots required.
HO The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  5 September 1995
would be produced, even without 
the numbers record companies 
look for in sales. Dragonfly is the 
fruition of that acclaim, and for 
some reason, I cant really give it 
the praise that previous review
ers gave bohemia.
Its not any particular aspect of 
Mae Moores style that keeps me1 
from loving this album  her 
lyrics are good, her chord stylings 
intelligent  but its the way 
that the styles are smashed to
gether. Her lyrical stylings are 
interesting enough that country 
artists could snip just about any
sity in the lyrical content within 
each song is not reflected in the 
guitar workings.
Very frequently, a two-chord 
structure will serve as back
ground as she freefalls the lyrics 
through a tangental melody line. 
Thats not a bad thing to have for 
one song, but the novelty wears 
off after a while. All of these sty
listic clashings make for the sound 
of a country artist who knows a 
lot of cool chords and does neat 
impressions of Suzanne Vega and 
Sarah McLachlan.
Shes packed this album with a
same middle frequencies, never 
reaching a raucous wail, never 
delving into the range of unnerv
ing stripped-down quietness that 
fuels such artists as McLachlan 
and Vega.
In a nutshell, this album is 
drony, has cool lyrics, and you 
could fall asleep to it. Id be inter
ested in hearing her first and 
next album, to hear what kind of 
directions shes taken and what 
directions she will take. However, 
if youre looking for diversity or 
unforced creativity, leave this one 
on the racks.
Mortal Kombat amuses despite poor acting
By DAN GOLDWASSER
Tartan Staffwriter
The lights in the theater dim. 
The usual stock of trailers pro
ceed as normal. Suddenly, the 
ambient noise in the theater goes 
up as the projectionist cranks up 
 the volume. Without warning, we 
hear Mortal Kombat! yelled in 
full Digital Ste
reo Sound. The 
techno music 
starts playing, 
and our eyes are 
treated to a 
screen full of 
flame, which 
takes shape in 
the symbol of 
the Mortal 
Kombat dra
gon. The adren
aline is pump
ing, and the au
dience is expect
ing to be (at the 
very least) en
tertained.
Mortal Kom
bat is a film 
based on the 
video game of 
the same name.
All of the favor
ite characters 
are there. But 
this time, three 
chosen Kombatants must 
save Earth from 
being taken 
over by the evil 
emperor of Outworld. These 
three are Liu 
Kang (Robin Shou), Johnny Cage 
(Linden Ashby, Wyatt Earp) and 
Sonya Blade (Bridgette Wilson, 
Billy Madison). They were cho
sen by Lord Rayden (Christopher 
Lambert, Highlander) to fight in 
the tournament of Mortal Kombat 
to prevent the Emperors evil sor
cerer Shang Tsung (CaryHiroyuki Tagawa, Rising Sun) 
from opening a gateway which 
would allow the Emporer to con
quer Earth.
Filled with eye-popping special
animated Reptile, Mortal Kombat 
is definitely a treat for the eyes. 
The sound is downright stunning 
 completely digital (depending 
which theater you see it in) and 
very clear. It is one of the best 
movies to hear in a while.
The acting, however, was rather 
sub-standard, and detracted from 
the quieter moments, when no

so when you see a fight, it is 
actually him. And the characters 
perform the moves as you would 
expect to see them in the video 
game. One disappointing aspect 
to this, however, was that there 
is not time enough to show all the 
moves, and there arent many (if 
any at all) fatalities. As a PG-13 
movie, this film doesnt come close 
to being exces
sively violent, 
which one might 
expect. To gamer 
an R rating, a film 
must have blood 
 and Mortal 
Kombat has only 
one drop of that.
Mortal Kombat

Most agreed that side effects 
of body piercings can heighten 
the experience. Allard said, 
there are two types of people: 
those who faint [after a piercof each piercing depends on 
what type of jewelry is used. 
Those piercings done with 
beaded rings cost $35 total, and 
piercings with bar-type jewelry 
cost $45.
This cost has led many fans of 
body piercings to resort to less 
professional methods. Kleinman does many of her own
straight piercing. Finally, the 
needle gets pushed through 
followed by the jewelry. The 
needle is then thrown away.
Some piercings will bleed 
more than others. Roman 
said that navels and ears 
wont bleed at all if done prop
erly.

said that the uppermost 
piercings in her ear and her 
bellybutton piercing hurt, but 
that she did get a rush.
Sophomore art major Mike 
Shaffer noted nothing about 
an adrenaline rush the first 
time he got his nipples pierced. 
He had a friend do it for him at 
home with a leather needle. 
The process took a long time 
and was painful, but, it was 
fun ... like a good pain, he 
said.
Shaffer did have the second 
hole in his right nipple done 
professionally in Washington 
D.C., but said that, it was $30 
for the pierce and $30 for the 
ring itself  a bit pricey for 
his taste.
Cost is also an issue. Al
though the prices in Pitts

lower than in other cities, more 
innovative adornments will 
still cost a good deal more than 
putting a stud through an ear
lobe. At Helion House, the cost

bought in Portland, Oregon. The 
kit consists of not much more 
than a sterilized needle. 
Kleinman admits that, although 
she is proud of having done her 
own piercings, youre not sup
posed to do it yourself. She said, 
Piercings are expensive if you 
go to a professional, but its 
worth it.
And it probably is worth it to 
go to a professional considering 
the increased safety of the pro
cedure. Roman has a set pro
cess for his clients. Customers 
first fill out waivers. The forms 
explain the basic after care cau
tions and things to stay away 
from. Next, the pierced-to-be is 
brought into the piercing room 
and the body area is cleaned. 
Antiseptic mouthwash is used 
for oral piercing while other 
body parts get cleaned with io
dine or alcohol.
The piercer will then use a 
fine point sharpie to mark where 
the holes are going to be. The 
skin is then clamped and lined 
with forceps in order to ensure a

Kroh offers that you might

since alcohol thins the blood 
[writers note: so does aspi

avoid that, too].
Allard highly recommends 
chemical as opposed to heat 
sterilization of equipment.
Roman stresses the impor
tance of allowing the pierced 
area to heal (6-8 weeks for 
most holes) before attempt
ing to remove it. Finally, it is 
important to keep your newly 
pierced area clean.
One area that everyone in

upon is that body piercing is 
an indi-viduals experience.

Comic Book Chronicles
by Jason Andracki
Welcome back and welcome to 
the third year of Comic Book 
Chronicles! Theres big news, so 
without further ado.... Saturday, 
September 9 is The Pitt Stop, 
Pittsburghs part of the Spirits of 
Independence Tour.
This isnt your typical comic 
book convention. Instead of fo
cusing on creators from the ma
jor publishers, Marvel, and DC, 
The Pitt Stop features the top 
names of the small press field. 
Also, rather than having the hall 
cluttered with dealers peddling 
the same over-priced gimmick 
books, Phantom of the Attic will 
be selling all the best from the 
independent publishers, many of 
whom will be at the show.
Phantom was hand picked by 
Cerebus Dave Sim, who visited 
the South Craig Street store on 
the last Cerebus World Tour. If 
the stores good enough for Dave 
Sim, then its good enough for 
you.
Now a little bit about some of 
the guests:
Dave Sim and Gerhard: Since 
1977 Dave Sim has been putting 
out the premier self-published 
comic, Cerebus. Gerhard took up 
the inking chores in the 1980s, 
and together he and Sim produce 
the most witty and thought pro
voking comic.
In addition to his work on 
Cerebus, Sim also spends time 
helping others, like Jeff Smith of 
Bone fame, in the self-publishing 
biz. Sim also put together the 
Spirits of Independence Tour.
Don Simpson: Simpson is the 
artist liaison for The Pitt Stop 
since his Fiasco Comics is based 
here.
He is the madman behind Bi
zarre Heroes and Megaton Man,
If youre only going to visit two 
artists, Id suggest Simpson and 
Sim.
Steve Bissette: In addition to 
his current self published mas

out Popes work in recent issues 
of Dark Horse Presents andNegative Burn.
Mark Wheatley: All CMU stu
dents and others who spend too
much time in cyberspace should 
check out Radical Dreamer. Youll 
think twice before hitting the clus
ter again.
Matt Feazell: You dont read 
independents because they are 
too expensive? Then check out 
Feazells Cynical Man. For 50 
cents you can get the funniest 
minicomics ever made. Plus check 
out his computer game and wear

[Writers note: Jim Valentino 
and David Lapham are unable to 
attend The Pitt Stop.]
In addition to all this fun on 
Saturday, check out Steve 
Bissettes Journeys Into Fear 
on Friday night, a history of hor
ror in comics, and get to hang out 
with the creators. The $3 admis
sion benefits the Comic Book Le
gal Defense Fund.
If youve never gone to a comic 
book show, then this is the one. 
There are no fees for autographs, 
and the creators are extremely 
happy to talk to fans.
Even if youve never seen their 
work, stop by and check out what 
they are doing. Also, this is the 
chance to meet winner of Xeric 
Foundation grants like Stephen 
Blue of Red River. The Xeric Foun
dation was set up by Peter Laird, 
of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 
fame, to help budding self-publishers.
This type of thing doesnt hap
pen often, so come out and sup
port independent comics and see 
that it doesnt take exclusive dis
tributorship and huge crossover 
to make great comics.
The Pitt Stop (9 am to 3 pm) 
and Steve Bissettes Journeys 
Into Fear (7 pm) will be at the 
Holiday Inn in Oakland. Admis
sion for each is $3.

Koyaanisqatsi
This movie is named after a Hopi Indian word 
meaning crazy life and things falling apart and 
big dog hides under my bed. With a score by 
Phillip Listen to My Silence Glass and a director 
named Ron Fricke, this movie is a montage of 
nature and the nasty old urban world. It sounds 
artsy and fun. There are no words and just some 
fun music. There are nice nature scenes and inter
esting urban scenes and there is music. Everyone 
likes music. See it with someone who is fun.
At 6, 8,10 pm, and midnight.

Pink Floyd: The Wall
This movie is all about a big, pink cat named 
Floyd. He has a long, furry tail and abig smile. See, 
what happens is this big cat goes to a wonderful 
candy land where there are many things to eat and 
pee on. Then this big cat finds a big wall that is 
really kind of terrible, if you think about it, a wall 
being in a candy land and all. So Floyd does 
something really cool and makes the wall fall 
down.
Actually, this movie is about a boy who is held 
under mind-control or somethingin a fascist state. 
What happens is these fascists are trying to make 
everyone pretty much the same, except for the 
pretty girls and all the dogs, because they are 
pretty much the same, anyway. So, anyway, this 
kid escapes and tears down a w;all.
Starring a bunch of guys from Pink Floyd and 
some other guys, this is a rock/pop staple. Its a 
movie that you have to see, so you might as well see 
it, anyway. Its a pretty cool movie, so go to it.
At 6, 8,10 pm, and midnight.

stars in, writes, and directs this love-o-rama. If 
you havent seen it yet, youre in for an earful. Its 
fast-paced and fun and there are guns and you get 
to see Harvey Keitel in his emotional role as a 
skankin jewel thief who takes care of his own, or 
something.
Yay.

Let the Good Times Roll
This movie is all about things that roll: cars, 
trucks, old jars, apples: all things that roll. There 
are lots of interesting things going on in this 
movie: people sing and people laugh. People do 
things that can be called fun. Its a very exciting 
movie, overall, and I would highly suggest it. Like 
all B-movies, the plot is secondary to the sheer 
comedy of the bad acting and strangely grainy 
picture. See it because of its negative qualities, 
which will make you laugh. See it with someone 
who rolls.
At 6, 8,10 pm, and midnight.

Knowoneness. Not even a 
word, but definitely an experi
ence. The knowoneness experi
ence comes to me via the band 
Electric Skychurch. The album, 
which is just slightly over an 
hour long, features a twist upon 
the enviro/new-age sound that 
has been gaining on the worlds 
music market today.
So, having never heard of this 
band before, I pop the CD into 
my stereo. Out comes the very 
melodious sound of waves 
crashing onto the shore. Imme
diately, I begin to cringe. Ive 
seen too many people who have 
fallen into that stress-free 
enviro-rut and I decided that 
catatonia wasnt for me this 
evening.
So I get up to remove the CD 
and before I can stop it, a tribal 
beat begins to make its way 
from my speakers.
Well, this is cool. So, I sit
back down and begin to listen. 
The first track, titled Abyss, is 
almost nine minutes long which, 
I think, is a pretty unusual thing 
for a band not yet well estab
lished.
However, I find myself enjoycan without a doubt say that this 
is the first CD I have ever re
ceived with instructions. I felt 
myself somewhat entertaining 
the notion of looking this place up 
if Im ever in California.
But, all in all, the CD was worth
A woman, with that deep, husky 976 
voice, begins to give you directions 
to follow....
ing the music more and more. By 
the time the second track, Cre
ation, comes on, Ive already for
gotten the fact that there are no 
lyrics and I usually hate most 
music without lyrics.
An hour later I eject the CD, 
finding myself still floating from 
the knowoneness experience. So, 
I begin to write up my review and 
I grab the press information that 
I was given along with the CD. As 
it turns out, there are directions 
to the knowoneness experience. I
giving a listen to and thats the 
information that I need to pass 
on to you folks. So, relax. Thats 
exactly what Im going to do.
Once again, the album is called 
Knowoneness by Electric Sky
church.
The album has nine tracks, only 
one of which is shorter than five 
minutes.
Dont let this deter you though, 
the CD is well worth spending an 
hour on. I believe that the track 
that held my attention the most
was track six, which was titled, 
Radiate. This track broke the 
pattern on the album by hav
ing vocal arrangements as well 
as instrumental. Not exactly 
lyrics, but something much 
more interesting. A woman, 
with that deep husky976 voice, 
begins to give you directions 
to follow.
She invites you to take a 
walk in the desert and experi
ence knowoneness. The song 
definitely holds your attention, 
even if its only to follow the 
directions.
The title track, Knowone
ness, is last on the CD and 
the one that I thought was the 
most disappointing. The other 
tracks all had the same basic 
beat, but had something to 
spice it up.
This track just put me in 
mind of the typical, and not so 
pleasant, enviro-music that we 
all love to hate. However, its 
the last track, so buy the CD, 
okay?
Director offers quality alternative films
By W. LABEIKOVSKY
Tartan Staffwriter
Many strange things are hap
pening in movies today.. Holly
wood has successfully managed 
to turn movies into products and 
long commercials, and has made 
the idea of a movie being artwork 
as foreign as a proverbial uni
corn.
On top of this horizon, some 
people turn up as the decon
structors of Hollywood and make 
the shallow salivate over their 
originality. Thus, today, pasticheurs are considered geniuses, 
T.V.-intoxicated pretentious 
blokes are serious artists, and 
any movie that is not in English 
is hyped up to the level of mas
terpiece.
The figure of the filmmaker that 
is out to say something, to make 
something beautiful through his 
films, has become a myth, or at 
best a rarity not only in the US 
(where such a figure was always 
rare) but in most of Europe as 
well. The majority of the film 
artists are holed up in the Third 
World and thus their presence 
can barely be felt elsewhere. 
Luckily for us, we now have Hal 
Hartley.
The current deity of indepen
dent cinema, Hartley started 
making feature films after gradu
ating from SUNY at Purchase. 
His first feature, The Unbeliev
able Truth, came out in 1990. 
Made for $70,000 (the cost of feed
ing Sly Stallone through Judge 
Dredd), this festival darling 
treated the world to a first glimpse 
of an unknown America: upstate 
New York.
Hartleys style is already no
ticeable in this movie whose suc
cess in festivals made possible 
the making of his second film 
Trust.
Trust was a smart (not 
smartass) tale about Maria
(Adrienne Shelley). Maria is an 
egocentric pregnant teenager who 
after causing her fathers death 
with the news of the baby, gets 
involved with Matthew (Martin 
Donovan), a sociopathic whiz kid. 
Maria is Hartleys first vision of a 
saint, a person that through 
changing her life, changes every
body elses. Shelley does a won
derful job in turning Maria from 
brat to angel.
Why do you care about me? 
Martin asks 
her. Because 
someone has 
to, she an
swers. Such 
pieces of naive, 
simplistic but 
insightful, and 
often beautiful 
dialogue, are 
one of Hartleys 
trademarks.
The even 
greater success 
of Trust 
prompted the 
slightly more 
ambitious 
Simple Men. A 
somewhat 
stronger piece 
than its prede
cessors, Sim
ple Men dealt 
with two es
tranged broth
ers who travel together to find 
the father they havent seen in 
many years.
The fact that their father was a 
baseball star who then became a 
radical terrorist is secondary, 
since Hartleys aim is to construct 
a story of redemption and respon
sibility in the middle of Long Is
land, involving lovable thieves 
and psychopaths.
This may be another of 
Hartleys trademarks.
After Simple Men and a couple 
of short films for PBS, Hal Hartley
 1995 Matador Records

camera on the film Amateur.
was ready for his most ambitious 
and arguably bestwork yet. Ama
teur turns out to be a stylish par
able about salvation, sanctity, 
and redemption, involving yet 
more shady characters. This is 
also Hartleys first film with a 
famous actress (at least in 
France).
The wonderful Isabelle Huppert plays a virgin nymphoma
niac ex-nun on a mission from 
God (although she doesnt know 
what it is yet). 
One day she 
meets Thomas, 
an amnesiac 
pimp who hap
pens to be 
sweet and sen
sitive when he 
doesnt know 
who he is.
Together 
they must save 
Sofia (Elina 
Lowensohn), 
who is Isabel
les mission and 
Thomass wife/ 
employee ... 
and thats only 
half the plot.
All of these 
weird charac
ters (that are 
actually more 
real than most 
Hollywood 
characters) would predictably 
make plenty of those movies that 
critics love to review because they 
can use the word quirky. 
However, this is not what 
Hartley gives us.
He genuinely loves his charac
ters and presents them to us in a 
seemingly naive style that is
somewhere between a sitcom and;' 
an early Godard movie.
In fact, one of Hartleys mairj; 
influences is the French Nevft 
Wavers, who he is careful not tqi 
copy, although he allows himselfan occasional homage (like the 
dancing scene in Simple Men). :
This emphasis in characters 
already sets Hartley apart from 
most of his contemporaries who 
seem to worry only about cool? 
lighting and camera acrobatics}. 
Hartley refuses to manipulate th 
image because for him the imag 
is the ultimate reality and is thu 
where the truth resides. That i 
why the early Hartley films look 
more like a documentary on its 
actors and sets than narrative 
films.
Hartleys often tragicomic tales 
respect the basic truth of the situL 
ations they present. Qualifying 
an ending as happy or sd 
makes little sense here since 
whats important is whether that 
ending is true to the characters it 
involves (Hartleys production 
company is called True Fiction).
So far the only constant in the 
stories seems to be the fatal in
tervention the police have in 
them.
This is probably intentional 
since Hartleys stories often show 
a subtext of an almost pacifist 
non-conformity.
His heroes can only achieve 
freedom by refusing to be owned; 
and in society that is often conf 
sidered criminal.
Hal Hartleys first three films 
are on video and in IT. Amateuf 
will be on video soon but wer 
praying for it to come to Pitts'; 
burgh again.
