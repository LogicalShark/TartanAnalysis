Tennis Team Wins One Sided Match.A101EMENTSAST0 DORMITORIES
RESERVATIONS ARE NOW BEINO HADE
The Plaid tennis team, displaying 
the best tennis that they have ever 
played this season, had very little 
trouble in trouncing Syracuse Uni 
versitys tennis team, 6 to 0, on the 
Design courts last Wednesday. With 
the weather conditions excellent and 
the courts in the best trim, it did 
not take the Tech men very long to 
warm up. Syracuse was entirely un
able to do anything with the home 
teams masterly playing and could 
only take one set. The match be
tween Bihlman of Tech, and Fuller, 
of Syracuse was the only one where 
the visitors had a look in. Bihlman 
wound up the first set 6 to 1, and 
Fuller cornered the second, 6 to 4. 
But the visiting player was badly 
overwhelmed, 6 to 0, in the last set. 
Not one deuce set was played. Of 
course, being one-sided, the match 
was rather disinteresting. Neverthe
less the Plaid men were right on edge 
and did some excellent work.
Captain Steen once more resorted 
to the slower, safer, game that he 
played against Geneva, and had little 
trouble winning his first two sets, 
both 6 to 1, from Parker, of Syra
cuse.
Davis, of Tech, had his opponent, 
Worden, well in hand and kept him 
guessing where the ball was going 
to be placed. The first set easily 
went to the Tech man, 6 to 0. In 
the second set Worden did not have 
a sufficiently strong come back. 
Nevertheless he made Davis fight his 
hardest to win, 6 to 4.
English, of Tech, always had the 
best of his opponent, taking the first 
two sets, 6 to 3, and 6 to 2. Bihlman 
had to go three sets to win from 
Fuller, of Syracuse, 6 to 1, 4 to 6, 
6 to 0.
In the doubles, Tech continued her 
pace and Davis and Steen defeated 
Worden and Parker, 6 to 3 and 6 to 2. 
Both Davis and Steen played heady 
games and the Plaid duo had little 
trouble in winning.
Bihlman and English got away with 
a whirlwind start and took six 
straight games before the visitors 
started. In the second set they won, 
6 to 4.
Summary.
SinglesEnglish, of Tech, defeated 
Bullard, of Syracuse, 6 to 0, 6 to 4.
Steen, of Tech, defeated Parker, 
of Syracuse, 6 to 1, 6 to 1.

Below is printed the information 
contained in the circular published by 
the Institution concerning the new 
dormitories. These circulars may be 
obtained now at the Bursars office.
Upperclassmen should put in their 
applications at once as this summer 
will bring in a flood of reservations 
from next years Plebes. The athletic 
association is considering reserving 
one-half of a floor as training quar
ters.
to lights and as to their comings and 
goings.
The club room in the basement of 
each lodge will be furnished with 
divans, tables, bookcases, rugs, etc. 
A piano will also be provided in each.

The Carnegie Institute of Tech
nology announces that two dormitor
ies for men will be ready for occu
pancy at the beginning of the first
The two buildings are for the pres
ent designated only as east and west 
lodges, as permanent names are to 
be chosen later. The plan of each 
dorm, is as shown in the accompany
ing cut except that one of the build
ings will be the entrance on the left 
which will transpose the grouping 
of rooms from one side of the corri
dor to the other.
The beanery will be open Sundays 
and holidays, serving three meals a 
day.
The supervision of the proctor, who 
will probably be graduate students, 
will be only nominal. He will have 
charge of the care of house furniture 
and any rules in regard to disorder. 
The students will be unrestricted as
semester of the college year, 1915-
1916.
Construction.The buildings are 
of brick and stone construction, fire
proof, electrically lighted and steam 
heated. Both contain club rooms, and 
on each floor is an outdoor sleeping 
porch for optional use. They are 
conveniently located with respect to 
the campus, gymnasium, athletic field, 
tennis courts, and other student resi
dences, and provide the advantages 
that are essential to community life 
among the undergraduates.

LECTURE BY MRS. 
GERTRUDE FULLER
Excellent Address at M. M. C. S. 
Last Week.
What a pity it is that everyone 
cannot hear her clear, sweet voice; 
cannot hear her sincere words. Such 
women make this a better world. 
These must have been the thoughts 
of all who listened to the speaker at 
the meeting held under the auspices 
of the Carnegie Economic Society on 
May 19 at the Assembly Hall of the 
Margaret Morrison Carnegie School. 
The meeting was addressed by Mrs. 
Gertrude Breslau Fuller, whose topic 
was Woman and Social Progress. 
Mrs. Fuller was introduced by Miss 
Ada Hopkins of the M. M. C. S., and 
immediately launched enthusiastic
ally into her topic. She said, This 
is a question which vitally concerns 
all for women, who comprise half of 
the human family, occupy an inferior 
position civilly, industrially, and so
cially. Continuing she said that this 
was often questioned. Our civil, so
cial, and industrial welfare are closely 
linked, so if we are civilly and indus
trially inferior, we are also socially 
inferior. The following facts prove 
that the above conditions exist. There 
are eight states in the Union where 
women have but small control over 
their own property, and sixteen states 
where women have no control or 
only partial control over their wages. 
Motherhood has always been lauded, 
and we all know the worth and value 
of motherhood. Yet there are 
twenty-seven states where a woman 
is not considered an equal parent, and 
until recently there were four states 
where a womans unborn babe could 
be willed away from her. Seventysix per cent of the women workers 
receive only sixty-six cents for every 
dollar received by a man for doing 
the same work.
What are we going to do about 
it? Mrs. Fuller asked. Men seem 
to think that the responsibilities of 
the nation rest on them. Has woman 
always occupied this inferior posi
tion?
To answer this question she then 
quickly and vividly traced the whole 
history of womankind from primitive 
times to the present. ' The mother 
has been the steward of the progress 
of each species. Primitive woman 
was strong, an equal to man, and the 
dominating factor of her race. She 
chose her own mate, and in doing so 
she brought the human race above its 
normal, for she chose the strongest

AN ASSEMBLY? YES !
At a recent meeting of one of our 
student senates the question of an 
assembly of all schools was again 
favorably discussed. It seems as 
though the matter is well worthy 
consideration on part of every stu
dent and every member of the fac
ulty.
Each of the four schools of our 
institution have their weekly assem
blies. We are in reality four distinct 
and separate parts of an institution, 
which should be a whole on many 
occasions,only brought together on 
Founders Day, at some athletic 
contest and once in a while on an 
outing. We lack the necessary co
operation for a successful institution. 
Our present mode and means of get
ting together are insufficient as any
one may see.
As has been suggested, why not 
an assembly. One hour a week de
voted to genaral school discussions 
and lectures would derive benefits un
told. It is true we lack a proper 
place at present on the campus, but 
we have Carnegie Music Hall and 
Carnegie Lecture Hall at our dis
posal. As to attendanceeach class 
may be responsible for the attend
ance of its membersand in like 
manner have special seating arrange
ments to do away with all unneces
sary confusion. The faculty may al
lot one credit to a reasonable at
tendance if deemed fit.
We can truthfully say that Car
negie is the only school that does 
not have a weeklylet alone daily 
assembly of the entire institution. It 
can be made the most looked-for
hour of the weekspeeches from our 
faculties, coaches, and timely speakers 
of the day, will tend to inspire and 
develop a truer and stronger Car
negie Spirit.
The Tartan suggests that the 
matter be carefully looked into by 
the administration. We voice the de
sire of the entire student body. It 
will give a chance to see better what 
each department is doing and the 
body as a whole.
THE SHILLING.
The last issue of the M. M. C. S. 
publication, The Shilling, has come 
into our hands, and we wish to ex
press a note of approval of the very 
good issue. Vale, and the poem 
entitled, To Our Departing Sisters 
are full of excellent thoughts and 
expressions, and are indicative of real 
literary talent. The clever presen
tation of news of personal interest is 
to be commended. The Shilling 
leaves an impression of cultivated 
thoughts and ideals; a very fair de
gree of proficiency of literary ex
pression, and moderate sense of hu
mor.
WANTEDA NAME.
The director has expressed his de
sire for appropriate names for the 
present highway through our cam
pus and the new dormitories. At 
present the name of the street is 
Woodlawn avenue, but it would be 
better to have a name suggestive of 
the institution which has made it 
what it is.
As to the dormitories, of which 
there are two, the same might im
ply. The Tartan will gladly publish 
all communications in regard to the 
above names.
COMMUNICATION.
Editors NoteThe Tartan is not 
responsible for the sentiment ex
pressed in any communication. 
Editor of the Tartan.
Dear Sir:
Last week there appeared a state
ment in the Tartan to the effect that 
the school camp would be restricted 
to the use of the female students 
until August 20th. Is such a restric
tion fair to the male students? A 
brief review of some of the school 
statistics will prove that it is not. 
The number of female students con
nected with the schools at the pres
ent time is only approximately onefifth of the total enrollment, while 
the period of vacation allotted them 
is four-fifths of the total vacation. 
Also the female students of the in
stitution are better off financially 
than the male students, and so the 
practically unlimited use of the 
school camp by the female students 
is uncalled for from this standpoint. 
Then, too, has the management who 
has been responsible for this narrow
minded policy taken into account the 
fact that there are connected with 
our night schools over fifteen hun
dred male students whose vacation 
periods occur between the first of 
July and the 15th of August, and
to whom the camp, if open to them 
on the same basis as that granted 
to the women, would prove an in
estimable benefit? Some may ask 
why it was not used more by the 
men students last summer. This was 
due to three reasons, first that the 
camp was not advertised as far as 
known in any school except the M. 
M. C. S. SecondlyThe cost of stay
ing at the camp over week-ends cost 
the students at the rate of over two 
dollars a day, and, ThirdlySeveral 
of the men students who went to the 
camp were politely told by those in 
charge that while the male students 
were allowed at camp, it made it very 
embarrassing for the girls, especially 
when they wanted to go in swimming, 
so they would not be missed any if 
they should remain away.
It is my opinion, and I feel I voice 
the opinion of the entire Student 
body of the three mens schools, that 
the camp should be used by the stu
dents of both sex, and should not 
be turned over to the chosen few who 
derive the least benefit by the use 
of it.
A Student.
A COMMUNICATION.
Editor of The Tartan.
Dear Sir:
I would like to offer a suggestion 
which I believe would find favor with 
the student body if followed out.
The students all like the song, 
Dear Old Tech, and many of them 
who play some musical instrument 
would like to have a copy of it. This 
cannot be bought, however, as the 
original song is no longer printed. I 
tried to get it at several of the music 
stores downtown but met with the 
same response each place. At Volkweins the clerk said, Are you from 
TECH? Upon answering affirma
tively, he replied, I thought you 
were, as so many of the fellows from 
TECH ask for that song.
My suggestion is that you enquire 
as to whether the copyright has ex
pired, and if it has, print this song in 
the last issue of the Tartan; either an 
insert or on one page of the paper. 
The chorus was printed in the Thistle, 
but not in such form that it can be 
very well used.

SIMPLIFIED SPELLING 
LECTURE.
When any project gains the confi
dence of men who stand as authori
tative on all matters of education in 
our universities and colleges, it seems 
lime that we as a student body pick 
up the suggestion and try to under
stand the matter of their study. Upon 
May 20th Professor George A. Dandon, instructor of English at the Co
lumbia University, spoke to the stu
dents of the Design and Science 
Schools in the Design Building upon 
Simplified Spelling.
The matter of inducing college and 
university men to adopt such a reform 
has not been promulgated over night 
but comes to us through a man of 
thorough education as the result of 
years of careful examination and ar
rangement, whereby a set of 7,000 
words have been so simplified as to 
demand consideration.
This amelioration of English spell
ing is presented to us as the result 
of years of very careful work upon 
the part of the Simplified Spelling 
Board of New York City. Its pur
pose is to induct as many simplified 
words into the reading matter before 
the people as is possible, and so give 
life to a new demand for the use of 
a more natural spelling.
It will mean, for example, the usage 
of center, not centre; color, not col
our; gram not gramme; license, not 
licence; maneuver, not maneuvre; me
dieval, not mediaeval; quartet, not 
quartette; traveler, not traveller, etc.
The National Education Associa
tion has also adopted twelve words 
for use in official publications, viz: 
program, catalog, decalog, prolog, 
demagog, pedagog, tho, altho, thoro, 
thorofare, thru, and thruout.
Upon May 10, 1915, 99 institutions 
had adopted resolutions in favor of 
simplified spelling, while some time 
prior to that date, 33 universities, col
leges and normal schools had also 
adopted (by faculty vote) such reso
lutions. Let us give the matter atten
tion.

THE PLAYS THE THING.
Editors NoteOwing to lack of 
room, this article was unavoidably 
omitted last week.
The reviewer turns with pleasure to 
the consideration of the work of Mr. 
Charles H. Meredith, which stands 
out very distinctly as that of a person 
of marked individuality and peculiar 
talent. His first essay was as Valen
tine in The Two Gentlemen of 
Verona, which will be remembered 
as pleasing in its spontanaity and 
convincing in its naturalness. He be
trays no consciousness of his audi
ence, a very strong factor in his 
favor; he has not shown a develop
ment proportionate to that of Mr. 
Steen because he began on a higher 
plane, while the very nature of his 
talent is bound to limit his versatility 
he will reach the heights, but only 
in a certain atmosphere.
He is a poet by naturevoice and 
face proclaim it; therefore he finds 
his happiest medium in the dreamy, 
mystical characters, such as Yeats 
Seanchau in The Kings Threshold 
a play requiring high artistic inter
pretation if it is to be a success, on 
account of its scenic simplicity and 
limited action.
Here the rich sensuous quality of 
his voice, which he uses well, lent a 
new beauty to the reading of his lines 
(into the feeling of which, he ap
peared to fully enter), and carried his 
audience quite out of the present, 
creating an atmosphere at once re
mote and mystical. This has been 
unquestionably his best achievement. 
Synges Tramp in The Shadow of 
the Glen was as sympathetically and 
acceptably treated. In Shaws You 
Never Can Tell his Mr. Valentine 
was clever and satisfying. One could 
hardly decide where he scored best 
as an extractor of teeth or as a dis
tracted lover. His Don Pedro 
(Much Ado About Nothing) not only 
added to the conviction that he has 
fulfilled the promise shown in his ear
liest efforts and has before him a 
hopeful future.
The Nora of Miss Annabel Ram
sey in The Shadow of the Glen 
should not be overlooked. She pos
sesses a peculiar evenness of voice 
that accords perfectly with the mo
notonous life of Synges heroine, 
thereby lending atmosphere to the 
scene. Her earliest interpretations of 
the role were better than later ones 
where she spoke in a higher key, 
using greater variety of tone an in
flection and a rapidity of utterance 
which destroys the sense of monot
ony so essential to excite a proper 
sympathy for this heroine. As the 
leader of the Greek Chorus in Ephiegnia her work compared favorably 
with that recently done by the Little 
Theatre Co. in The Trojan Women.
She does studies in drab well, as 
her Mis Carry Ellsworth in Zona 
Gales Neighbors testifies.
Miss Lucy Barton invested Shaws 
Mrs. Clandon with a charm and 
intimacy pleasant to remember and 
may feel assured of a welcome in any 
future effort.
Mr. Howard Smith with his 
gloomy blade gives one pausehe 
suggests the Gothic in art. His voice 
is exactly what one would expect 
from one of those long figures, in the 
Hall of Architecture, were it sudden
ly endowed with lifeit terrifies the 
unaccustomed earone sits up and 
takes notice, as it were. The roars 
of his Bohun in You Never Can 
Tell still reverberatetis the very 
voice of Jove: What a viking he would 
make! Undoubtedly he has his place 
in the scheme of things theatrical, 
just where, is not yet certain. Clau
dio (Much Ado About Nothing), not 
an inspiring character under any con
ditions, is a difficult role in which to 
win the sympathy of an audience. Mr. 
Smith, possibly got as much out of it 
as there is in it.

THE PLAYS THE THING.

Poor Duffy!that is how one feels 
about it and sympathetically, too 
He came into his theatrical life wail
ing (Launce, in The Two Gentle
men of Verona) and seems fore
doomed to dismal thingseven Pylades is not a cheerful person to con
template, when you realize that he is 
fated to marry Electra.
But Mr. Charles Duffy is above 
and beyond mere human sympathy 
he commands admiration for the way 
he takes the bull by the horns and 
goes to it. His personality ex
presses itself, most happily, in char
acters of middle life and old age. 
There is just a hint of humor about 
most of his workone was conscious 
of the grim, under that sheet cover
ing old Burke in The Shadow of The 
Glen. He was well cast in The 
Second Shepherds Play as the first 
Shepherd and read his lines well 
no easy task in this play.
One of the best things he has done 
was Mr. Crampton in You Never 
Can Tell for which, rather unpleas
ant character, he succeeded in excit
ing a certain sympathy. One forgot 
the actor in the character which 
proves that Mr. Duffy has grown, ar
tistically, in the past year. He is 
painstaking in all that he essays, thus 
assuring his friends that the end is 
not yet.
Among those whose earnest work 
has given them a claim to recognition, 
is Miss Betty Brown, who will be re
called as The Youngest Pupil in 
The Kings Threshold and The 
First Voice in Iphigenia. Her 
Dolly Clandon in You Never Can 
Tell created favorable comment and 
had all the verse and irrepressability which one looked for in that 
young person. As Hero in Much 
Ado About Nothing she was pleas
ing to look upon and interesting in 
her interpretation of Shakespeares 
much-maligned heroine.
Mr. John E. Cathers Ruffo the 
goatherd, in The Chaplet of Pan, 
proved the right man in the right 
place. He gave it the flavor of the 
woods and the fields and that near
ness to nature without which such a
character must be dull and stupid. He 
has the pastoral poetic temperament 
(if one may judge from one perform
ance' which enables him to read the 
heart of the rustic and bring him be
fore us in all his naive simplicity.

ATHLETIC MEET.
Last Wednesday afternoon, the 
Athletic Association of the Margaret 
Morrison Carnegie School held an 
Athletic Meet on the Field. Owing 
to delays in getting started, it was 
impossible to finish and the following 
events are scheduled to come off next 
Wednesday: Baseball game, between
the Plebes and Sophomores, Broad 
Jump, and Basketball Throw. Al
though some of the girls had late 
afternoon classes, a large crowd was 
present and was quite enthusiastic 
over the close outcome of the con
test. According to the results of the 
various entries last week, the Plebes 
are ahead in points. The Sophomores, 
however, have quite a good chance 
yet and by hard work may still win 
the silver cup which Miss Stoner has 
offered to the class winning the high
est number of points. The following 
are the winners as recorded last week:
High jump: Janet Mandell, Plebe, 
4.2 feet; Irene McName, Plebe, 4.0

AWARDING OF VARSITY 
SWEATERS.
For the first time in the history of 
Margaret Morrison, the school bas
ketball team received Varsity sweat
ers. This was on Monday, May 24, 
directly after the installation of the 
Student Government officers.
Miss Stoner, head of the Depart
ment of Physical Training, awarded 
the sweaters. The six girls of the 
Varsity team were called one by one 
to the front of the hall and presented 
with their sweaters. Those receiving 
them were Marguerite Spilman, 15; 
Marion Pichl, 16; Marguerite Menges, 
16, Florence Burgham, 17; Margaret 
Wirth, 17, and Helen Wassel 17. The 
team was chosen from the three up
per classes.
Before the awarding of the sweat
ers Eliza Dickey made a few remarks 
regarding the athletics in the school. 
She praised the work which has been 
done this year, and inspired the girls 
to keep it up in the future. We are 
sure that the work of the Association 
can but advance under the direction 
of the new executive committee.
Marion Pichel, the president for 
next year, is the most capable girl in
the school for the office. She has al
ready shown herself a capable man
ager besides putting an unusual spirit 
in the activities with which she has 
been connected since entering Mar
garet Morrison.
STUDENT GOVERNMENT 
OFFICERS INSTALLED.
The annual installation of officers 
of the Student Government Associa
tion took place Monday, May 24, at 
the regular Student Assembly.
In the absence of Lee M. Hartman, 
the former president, Eliza Dickey, 
president of the Senior class, presid
ed over the meeting. The first thing 
on the program was singing by the 
student body, directed by Miss Stoner. 
Immediately following was a short 
address by Dean Breed regarding the 
Student Government Association. 
Mary Ride, the new president, was 
then called for and made a speech to 
the girls asking for their support and 
sincere co-operation in conducting the 
work of the Association during the 
coming year.
Constance C. Stout, the vice presi
dent, was next called for; then Gail 
Sellers, the Secretary, and Erma 
Pryme (the Treasurer. Each of the 
girls said a few words regarding their 
plans and expectations for next year.
LECTURE BY MRS. FULLER
Continued from Page 1 
and best men. With the discovery of 
fire these conditions were changed. 
A division of labor on a sex basis 
occurred here. Woman whose move
ments were naturally hampered, at
tended the camp fire. She became 
the first agriculturist, the first maker 
of pottery, the domesticator of wild 
animals and the first builder of shel
ters. She was the tailor, physician, 
and nurse of her people. While this 
was going on the men were develop
ing the destructive arts. Women de
veloped the tools and men the 
weapons. The men killed the men 
of the neighboring tribes and made 
slaves of the wives of the latter. It 
was here that woman lost her place 
in society, for the wives of the vic
torious warriors were soon made to 
take the places of the captured 
women. This was not a mark of in
feriority for women had not learned 
the use of the destructive weapons 
and so could not protect themselves.
Gradually a more peaceful mode of 
living was adopted, and the men 
came to live about the camp fires. 
This was the age of brute force. The 
big picked out the kind of work that 
they wanted to do and decided that 
this was mans work, the work that 
they disliked they called womans 
work.
So we see that woman once occu
pied a free position, but lost it by 
the introduction of slavery. Her po
sition now is a remnant of this slav
ery. Those who say her position is 
all right are harboring an old worn 
out theory. We hear it said that 
womans place is at home! If all the 
women were to leave the school
rooms, the stores, the shops, and the
offices we would hear a tremendous 
wail go up. Men make fun of wom
ans dress. Her taste in dress is the 
result of the taste of man. It takes 
a woman of physical strength and 
courage to face the world with a 
thirty-inch waist. When man be
came the chooser he did not do as 
woman had done, who chose a 
strong and courageous mate. He 
chose the small, compromising wom
an. The average man chooses a lit
tle woman who will look up into 
his eyes and believe everything he 
says. His choosing of a small and 
weak mate reduced the strength and 
mind of the human race. We cannot 
breed a strong race from weak and 
undertrodden women. They must 
have the fullest development of body, 
mind, and soul. We have heard it 
said that the hand that rocks the 
cradle rules the world. It is a lie! 
The hand that robs the cradle rules 
the world!
Our women must be strong, intelli
gent, and self-reliant. They cannot 
be this if, when they ask for enough 
wages to live a chaste life, a human 
life, they get the policemans club 
and jail, as has so often occurred. 
From this they learned that their 
salvation lay in the political machine. 
So the women want and must have 
political powers in order to gain their 
rights.
There were about one hundred 
women and fifteen men present at 
the meeting. The many humorous 
remarks of Mrs. Fuller made her ear
nest and sincere address the more in
teresting to them. This was perhaps 
the last meeting of this semester of 
the Economic Society. During this, 
its first year, the Society has had 
many excellent and noted speakers 
at the schools to address the stu
dents. The presence of these speak
ers and the success of the many meet
ings has been almost entirely due 
to the efforts of the president of the 
Economic Society, Harry Horelick, of 
the School of Applied Science.

Assembly Elections.
The Tartan goes to press too early 
to render a report on the Student 
Assembly elections held yesterday. 
However, to the young man to whom 
the honor of presidency is allotted 
we extend the wishes and congratu
lations of the student body. The as
sembly is an organization the success 
of which depends upon the guiding 
hand. An open policy devoid of any 
political machinations, should be the 
aim of the newly elected officers. 
Upon such foundation can the stu
dent assembly aspire to greater suc
cess and assist in welding together 
the support of the student body. A 
clean, wholesome administration, 
open-minded and sincere in the in
terests of the all Industries men, can
not fail in its purpose.
To the passing officers of the 1914- 
15 term a word of appreciation and 
thanks for their untiring services.
Thursday, May 20th, was official 
Letter Day for Industries. A 
wealth of good may come of this 
far-seeing suggestion made last 
month by D. Koontz.
Kingsbury was elected president of 
the Avo Club at their smoker a week 
ago last Wednesday. King is a fine 
type of student and we congratulate 
the Avo. Pete Orr, the graduating 
officer, is worthy of much credit for 
his splendid work in organizing the 
Avo.
Adolph Schtz, Industries, was 
elected president of the Musical 
Clubs for 1915-16. Schtz is unques
tionably a hard worker and his en
deavors along musical lines during 
the last two years have merited this 
distinctive honor.
The Middle baseball enthusiasts 
met a Science team Thursday and, 
after an interesting session, lost, 4-2. 
Better luck next time.
Smith, H. W., made his initial try 
as a varsity player in the Tech-State 
game. A little less nervousness and 
Smitley will improve considerably. 
That pose is unique.
Sam McNulty left for his home in
Oil City last week. No more Caruso.
The Thistle has been selling for 
several weeks and every class should 
manage before vacation to have its 
bill paid.
The Middles and Plebes have de
cided to hold a joint banquet. Details 
later.
Next years Plebes are doomed to 
wear green sox.
We were surprised at Red Millers 
rather stubborn opposition that fresh
men be permitted to smoke in the 
Carnegie Union in view of the fact 
that that institution was created spe
cifically to be the one place where all 
Tech students should meet upon com
mon ground. Needless to say, his mo
tion fell through.
Koontzs suggestion that the new 
rules and regulations for next falls 
plebes be placed in the hands of the 
present middles, next years uppers, 
seems to clear the situation. Too 
many liberties to indirectly concerned 
students leads to confusion.
A Thistle has been forwarded to 
the parents of Sumner E. Fry, lately 
deceased vice president of the Stu
dent Assembly.
Class Day exercises June 10th. 
Next train out, then.
THE PLAYS THE THING
Continued from Page 3
work of the season and in the fore
ground may be noted Miss Alicia 
Guthries interpretation of Miss Diantha Able, who penetrated to the 
depths, in one sentence, the character 
of Ezra Williams, There is nothing 
for Ezra but just Ezra, nothing for 
him, but just him! and who was so 
convincing that one found himself in
stantly viewing Ezras narrowness 
with commiseration. It was a very 
creditable piece of work and true to 
type. Her voice carries well and she 
uses it with discretion; none of her 
lines are ever lost, her work in the 
Chorus of Ihigenia bearing witness to 
this fact. Her Peg, the ballad sing
er was earnest but not as suitable a 
vehicle for her talent as Diantha. 
Mrs. Clandon suited her better, only 
here she appeared conscious of her
self and her surroundings. It is easier 
to do the remote, the unusual, for the 
environment helps to lift the actor 
out of himself, where the modern and 
usual often serves only to emphasize 
the personality of the actor.

LAST GLEE CONCERT.
At Taylor Hall, 7125 Kelly street, 
Homewood District, will be the last 
Glee concert for 1914-15 club.
All Glee Club men are requested 
to be there regardless whether their 
insignias were awarded or not. If 
you did not get your insignia show 
your spirit anyway by being at this 
concert.
A good dance is promised after this 
affair, which, by the way, is for a 
charitable purpose, and is being held 
under the auspices of the Queens 
Daughters. Those who attended 
their Fort Pitt concerts remember 
what a good time they had.
So every man for his boiler plate

DESIGN SCHOOL NOTES
SENATE RULINGS.
The Student Senate of the School 
of Applied Design met last Friday 
and adopted the following set of 
rules:
I. Unnecessary noise in the halls 
and main corridors of this building is 
forbidden.
II. Bulletin boards must be used 
to display signs and notices of any 
kind.
III. Breaking or marring furni
ture, woodwork, marble or statuary 
is an act of vandalism, punishable by 
a fine and any other penalty that the 
offense may warrant.
IV. Smoking is prohibited in the 
Exhibition room and Theatre.
V. In order to promote the spirit 
and fellowship of the Institution, 
Plebes shall obey all traditions and 
customs as defined by the school.
VI. Any offense not covered spe
cifically by the above rules shall be 
punished as the Senate may direct.
These rulings are for the good of 
the school in general, and it is up 
to all Design School men to respect 
them, and see that they are respected.
CLASS B CHARETTE.
The last Beaux Art charette of the 
year was finished on Saturday. Quite 
a number of interesting problems, 
Municipal Power Plant, were sent in. 
On account of the increased amount 
of time it took for the Rendu, many 
of the problems were not completely 
rendered. But few Order Problems 
were in evidence, there being six to 
finish, and nearly forty to take the 
esquisse. It looks as if the boys are 
getting tired.
Judgment held upon May 17th by 
a jury composed of Messrs. Hitchens, 
Sternfeld and Koyl awarded the fol
lowing mentions to first year archi
tects. This will probably be the last 
problem of this term and remarkable 
and gratifying results were obtained. 
The problem was the drawing of plan 
and elevation views of a small tennis 
club.
First Mention: J. P. Davis, E.
Green (commended), R. C. Loar, H. 
E. McMillan, J. L. Payne, A. Sharove, 
R. W. Spring, O. Wilkins, C. C.

A Sophomore class meeting was 
held upon May 18th at which time 
the underwritten officers were elected 
to the Thistle Board for the season

SEWICKLEY PERFORMANCE.
The dramatic students of the De

Pan to a large and delighted audi
ence at Sewickley on last Tuesday 
night. The performance was voted 
the best that the department had ever 
given, and next year, with a number 
of upperclassmen in the department, 
great things are to be expected.
PRIZE COMPETITION FOR 
DESIGN.
A rare opportunity has been offered 
to artists and designers who are in
vited to participate in the competi
tions for designs of two seals or em
blems, to serve as the official sym
bols of the North American Gymnas
tic Union and its subsidiary, the Nor
mal College of the V. A. G. N., re
spectively. For the two emblems a 
prize of $100 is offered. Further in
formation can be secured from an
nouncement on the bulletin at the 
Deans office in the Design Building.
TECH DESIGN AND TECH 
STUDIO EXHIBITION.
Few occasions of the past year 
have been marked with a more pro
nounced interest or a more unique 
pleasure than the Second Annual Ex
hibition of the Tech Design Club 
and Tech Studio Club. To make the 
scope of this exhibition as conven
ient as possible, two dates were set 
for inspection. The first took place 
on Wednesday afternoon of May the 
twenty-sixth, at which time a tea 
dansant was enjoyed by many stu
dents. The doors will again be open 
on Friday evening of May the 
twenty-eighth, at which time the

In the longest and by far the most 
uninteresting game at Tech Field 
this year, Muskingum overcame the 
Plaid nine, 2 to 0. after a tiresome 
struggle. The only feature of the 
game was the work of the two pitch
ers, Hines and Mcllvaine. The latter 
seemed in great form and his twirl
ing kept the home team guessing. 
Only three hits were made off of his 
delivery, one of these a double by 
Doherty. Hines played a steady game 
and a couple of times managed to 
pitch himself out of some bad holes.

The hits registered against him were

Both teams fielded almost perfect
ly and there were comparatively few 
errors. Muskingum started the ses
sion by scoring a run in the first in
ning. D. Wilson bunted and beat the 
throw tto first. A sacrifice and a 
single brought him in. Doherty, not 
knowing that there were two down,

SCIENCE SOPHS AGAIN 
VICTORIOUS.
Tuesday afternoon of last week 'the 
Science Sophs and Industry Middle
men met in the first of a series of 
games to decide the school champion
ship. However, there has been some 
question whether the Middlemen 
have a right to represent the Industry 
School in this series, as they were 
defeated by the lower team.
The game was well played and the 
Science men won out due to the good 
work of their pitcher and their abil
ity to hit when hits meant runs. The 
Industry men were a little unsteady 
at the beginning but soon settled 
down and played airtight ball. The 
victory is highly regarded by the 
Science men since their opponents 
had a couple of varsity players in 
their line-up. And, by the way, the 
Science Sophs could give the varsity 
a good, interesting gamewhy not 
give them the chance. It was no
ticed that Coach A1 Wagner and 
Manager Pringle were at the game, 
possibly looking for some recruits 
for the varsity.
The game was called in the seventh 
to allow the varsity to practice.

Mr. Louis Sandler is amongst the 
leaders in this contest. He needs the 
support of every student in this insti
tution. He has been gradually climb
ing to the front and if the students 
aid him as they should, there would 
be no doubt as to whether Tech or 
Pitt will receive a few thousand dol
lars for their Athletic Association.
The National Collegiate Athletic 
Association held its ninth annual con
vention at Chicago this year. In all 
there was present several hundreds of 
athletic directors and coaches repre
senting 180 colleges and universities.
More than 2,000 Chinese students 
are studying in American universities 
this year.

SPORTING NOTES.
The Tech frat. houses and training 
house put up many of the prep, school 
athletes here for the Pitt Meet last 
Saturday. Shaw High School of 
Cleveland brought down a team of 
nine men, all of whom stayed at the 
training house and didnt even see a 
Pitt man during their stay here. Rath
er reflects on the hospitality and sys
tem of the bunch across the way.
The basketball schedule is almost 
complete. Tow trips are arranged, 
one to Cornell, Colgate, and either 
Syracuse or Union. The usual games 
are scheduled with Pitt, Penn State 
and Allegheny.
The athletic association have de
cided that one person or group may 
play only three successive sets of 
tennis on the school courts.
It has been definitely decided that 
there will be no training house next 
year due to many reasons. No sup
port was received by the basketball 
or baseball teams which caused a 
rather heavy loss. Training quarters 
will probably be arranged for in the 
dormitories.
The track team goes to Westmin
ster Saturday for a dual meet. West
minster also holds an interscholastic 
meet at the same time. From West
minsters showing so far we should 
have no trouble in winning, though 
Tech will be without the services of 
Wright.
The basketball team plays at Grove 
City Saturday. The final game is 
with the alumni and night students 
May 5th.
The heavy rains last week messed 
things generally in athletes. The 
most important event abandoned was 
the Intercollegiate Meet in which we 
had a good show for second place. 
The baseball team lost a game with 
Otterbein and the tennis team a match 
with Grove City.
The tennis team closes the season 
with a match at Geneva Saturday.
The training house serenaded the 
wedding of Brandt, 13 Science to 
Miss Irene Fisher at the home of the 
bride on Negley avenue. The bride
groom made a short speech and intro
duced the bunch to the lady. Free
land, 13 Science, was best man.
PAGEANT TO BE GIVEN BY 
STUDENTS.
In a mass meeting, held Friday, 
May 21, in Room 209, Applied Sci
ence, Mr. Meredith outlined plans 
for a big pageant to be held on Class 
Day, June 7th. Meredith claims that 
a little outside work such as this 
occasion will be a good thing 
ior the fellows who do not get any
thing like that.
A number of students will be 
needed and the fellows are urged to 
respond when the notice of rehearsal 
is posted.
MICHIGAN WINS.
Opponents Decisively Defeat 
Carnegie.
The tennis team was entirely unable 
to cope with the strong racquet team 
which the University of Michigan 
has put forth this year. The visitors 
put up some of the best tennis that 
will be seen here this spring and had 
the best of the Tech-ites in all de
partments of the game.
Although the score is very one
sided the Plaid players put up a hard 
struggle and made Michigan in many 
cases go the full number of sets.
The summaries:
Reindel of Michigan defeated Steen 
of Tech, 6-3, 4-6, 6-0.
Crawford of Michigan defeated Da
vis of Tech, 4-6, 6-1, 6-4.
Mack of Michigan defeated Bihlman of Tech, 5-7, 6-0, 6-1.
Switzer of Michigan defeated Eng
lish of Tech, 6-0, 6-3.
Reindel and Crawford defeated Da
vis and Steen, 4-6, 6-2, 6-4.
Mack and Switzer defeated Bihlman 
and English, 7-5, 6-4.
PROGRESS OF THE SOUTHERN 
CLUB.
This year witnessed the formation 
of the Southern Club in Carnegie. 
Though still quite young, it is already 
firmly established and is sure to be 
a factor in the life of the future South
ern student. Next year the club will 
have its own house, which will make 
the social life of the students in school 
much better. The house which has 
already been arranged for, will ac
commodate about twenty students and 
is situated very near the schools. The 
new student will have a place to go 
immediately upon arriving in the city 
which any student will recognize as 
a great advantage to the new man.
Every applicant, for entrance to the 
school from the South, is to be com
municated with during the early sum
mer in order that he may profit by 
the advantages brought about by the 
club. A plan of advertising is to be 
carried out during the summer, to in
terest the Southern High Schools 
and their students in the work of 
Carnegie.
At a meeting held May 19, the fol
lowing officers were eelcted for next 
year:
President, Talmage R. Cooley.
Sec. and Treas., Bernard B. Spigel.
The three vice presidents which are 
chosen from the three schools, re
spectively, are to be electd at the be
ginning of the 1915-1916 school year. 
Much credit is due this years officers 
and especially the retiring president, 
Mr. Crump, for the work they havfe 
done in organizing the club and put
ting it upon a sound basis.
The club is to hold its final banquet 
of the year on Saturday night, June
5, at the Schenley Hotel. Special fea
tures of entertainment will be pro
vided.
