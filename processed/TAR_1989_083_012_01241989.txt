Applicant charges CMU 
with discrimination
By JONATHAN LEVY
Tartan Contributing Editor
An Indian student who ap
plied to three Carnegie Mellon 
graduate programs and was de
nied admission by all three has 
filed a complaint accusing Car
negie Mellon of discrimination 
against Asian-American stu
dents. The complaint was filed 
with the U.S. Department of 
Education under Title VI of the 
Civil Rights Act of 1964.
The student, who has not been 
identified, applied for admis
sion to SUPA, GSIA, and the 
Statistics Department. Accordingto University Attorney Alvin 
Brannick, the student was re
jected for academic reasons in 
all three cases and no discrimi
nation was involved.
The Department of Educa
tion will send an investigator to 
Carnegie Mellon duringthe first 
week of February to determine 
whether the complaint is justi
fied.
The investigator will inter
view people involved in the 
admissions decisions in all three 
programs as well as Indian and 
other minority students at 
Carnegie Mellon. He or she will 
also ask the University for in
formation and statistics on its 
admissions policies.
After conducting its investi
gation, the Department of Edu
cation will choose from three 
possible courses of action. It may 
try to negotiate a conciliation 
between the University and the 
student, or it could make a rulcontinued on page 7

President Richard M. Cyert announced 
plans to retire last week, signalling 
the official beginning of a year-long 
search for his successor.
Two search committees  one fac
ulty and one trustee  will look for 
candidates nation-wide to replace 
Cyert, who plans to step down June 30, 
1990. A steering committee of trus
tees, faculty members, and one stu
dent will consider a short list of candi
dates compiled by the search commit
tees and make the final recommenda
tion to the Board of Trustees.
To solicit suggestions on the search 
criteria and objectives and to present 
its plans for conducting the search, the 
faculty search committee will hold an 
open meeting tomorrow at 3:30 pm in 
Doherty Hall 1112.
The steering committee will be 
chaired by Douglas D. Danforth, Board

j it In response to student concerns
regarding the Graduate School of 
Industrial Administrations dis
appointing placing in Business 
Week's 1988 ranking of business 
schools, GSIAs administration 
has prepared its own rebuttal to 
the survey.
Many students were concerned 
after the November 28 issue of 
the magazine had rated the col
lege as the 13th best business 
school in the nation. Most stu
dents had expected GSIA to re
ceive a higher ranking, and the 
colleges student advisory council 
asked the deans to respond.
The administrations response 
came in a stinging position paper
distributed to masters students 
entitled The Power of the Press: 
The Best Business Schools (Ac
cording to Business Week) by As
sociate Dean Hker Baybars. GSIA 
administration delivered the 
position paper to the students in 
a meeting on December 14.
In an interview last week, 
Baybars downplayed the effect of 
the survey. It is not by any means 
seen as a damaging blow by me, 
as head of the Masters program. 
Students reacted much more 
strongly to the articles. Faculty 
response is basically, Business 
Week's survey is a poor survey. 
For the survey, Business Week 
polled recruiters from major cor
porations and members of the 
MBA Class of 1988. Typically,

Seven people were selected in early 
December to receive honorary degrees at 
Carnegie Mellons 1989 commencement. 
Of the seven, two have declined the honor 
and one has died; three others have yet to 
reply to the University.
Only Raoul Bott, a distinguished Har
vard mathematician who received his PhD 
from CMU in 1949, has accepted the award 
and will appear at commencement on May
21.
In.addition to Bott, three nominees  
the statistician George Box, earthquake 
engineer Emilio Rosenbleuth, and univer
sity chancellor Clifton Wharton  have 
yet to reply and may accept the honor.
Michael Mansfield, the recently-retired 
U.S. ambassador to Japan and one-time 
U.S. Senator, and Katherine Graham, the 
owner and publisher of The Washington 
Post and Newsweek, have declined the 
awards, according to Assistant to the 
President Richard Barnhart. The recipi
ent of an award must be present at com
mencement to accept the honor.
The seventh person selected by the 
committee to receive an award was the 
American-born sculptor Isamu Noguchi, 
who died at the age of 88 last month after 
the selection process was complete. Ac
cording to Barnhart, Noguchi will not be 
awarded the degree posthumously.
Noguchis work appears in both the 
Metropolitan Museum of Art and the 
Modem Museum of Art in New York City. 
In addition, other important Noguchi works
can be found in the Associated Press build
ing and the Chase Manhattan Bank Plaza 
in New York and the John Hancock build
ing in Chicago.
Each year, a committee selects five 
award winners and two alternates from a 
list of nominees submitted by the various 
colleges. Barnhart asked The Tartan not 
to reveal which of the candidates were al
ternates because it lessens the value of 
the degree. Both Mansfield and Graham 
were winners.

Quit Smoking program begins
The University has begun a series of smoking cessation pro
grams for students, faculty, and staff. Three types of programs 
are available. Those who wish to work with a group may enter the 
small-group interactive program which consists of a series of six 
hour long sessions over four weeks. The sessions are limited to 
12 participants each. There are six series of sessions remaining 
between now and the end of the semester.
Those who wish to participate in the self-quit program may 
obtain materials in the Personnel office or the Student Affairs 
office. The office of Staff Training and Development and the Stu
dent Affairs office will continue to offer smoking awareness 
programs.
Anyone who is interested in more information may contact 
Donna Morosky at X2075.
New dormitory behind schedule
Despite good weather, the construction of the new dorm is sev
eral weeks behind schedule, according to Director of Housing 
Tony Martin. Underground conditions and problems with the 
caissons caused delays. Bad weather in upcomingmonths, Martin 
said, could cause more delays in the tight scheduling.
The west wing, nearest Skibo, is going up faster than the east 
wing, which will house the kitchens, food service, and dining fa
cilities scheduled to open in January 1990. The east wingmay not 
not be ready for occupancy in the fall.
CMU Director of Construction Tom Murphy said that evalu

Bush considers 
new user fees
WASHINGTON (DJ)  White 
House budget director-designate 
Richard Darman said Monday 
that several revenue-raising 
measures might not really be tax 
increases, although the public 
perception of them might keep 
them off limits to the Bush ad
ministration.
Darman appeared to open a 
crack in the door to an increase in 
excise taxes by saying a boost in 
the federal gasoline tax under 
some circumstances might be 
considered a user fee. Darman 
also suggested increases in excise 
taxes on alcoholic beverages and 
tobacco might fall under the same 
rubric.
Despite his own flexibility on 
semantics, however, Darman 
said, in the end, such definitional 
matters are political; applying the 
old if-it-looks-like-a-duck rule  
if it looks like a tax to most 
Americans, ifs a tax, he said. 
And President Bush has been 
quite specific about opposing an 
increase in the gasoline tax.
Still, Darman invites the con
clusion that Bush might accept 
some kind of tax increase. Bush 
has stated that he would oppose 
all new taxes, Darman wrote to 
the Senate Governmental Affairs 
Committee. But he added, That 
doesnt mean that all increases in 
government receipts are new 
taxes.
Report cites 
Meese for ethics
detyacetng
WASHINGTON (AP)Former 
Attorney General Edwin Meese
III violated federal ethics stan
dards by acting at the request of a 
friend to assist scandal-plagued 
Wedtech Corp. and a proposed $1 
billion Middle East oil pipeline, a 
Justice Department report con
cluded Tuesday.
The report concluded that 
Meese engaged in conduct which 
should not be tolerated of any
government employee, especially 
not the attorney general.
If Meese were still attorney 
general, we would recommend... 
that the president take discipli
nary action, it said.
The Justice Departments Of
fice of Professional Responsibil
ity also said Meese violated ethics 
standards by participating in of
ficial matters involving the re
gional Bell Telephone companies 
while he held some $14,000 in 
telecommunications stock.
Meese said last July he had 
been completely vindicated by 
the decision of independent coun
sel James C. McKay not to seek 
an indictment against him.
We trust that this analysis will 
lay to rest the claims by Mr. Meese 
that the appropriate standard for 
official behavior is whether an 
independent counsel seeks an 
officials indictment, the report 
said.

CHICAGO (AP)  FBI agents 
posing as commodities traders 
have obtained evidence of wide
spread fraud involving millions 
of dollars at the nations two larg
est futures exchanges.
Investigators believe the trad
ers cheated customers of millions 
ol dollars in the execution of buy 
and sell orders at the exchanges, 
which deal in a variety of con
tracts for future delivery of grains, 
livestock, Treasury bonds, foreign 
currencies and other commodi
ties.
The investigation focused on 50 
to 100 brokers, floor traders and 
commodity executives at the 
Chicago Board of Trade and the 
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
Hundreds of conversations were 
secretly tape recorded on the 
exchanges trading floors during 
a two-year period.
Trades were allegedly rigged to 
prevent customers from getting 
fair-market prices, and brokers 
allegedly sent false reports to 
customers to hide that profits had 
been skimmed and that over
charges were made on commis
sions.
Several subpoenas were served 
Wednesday, but any arrests or 
indictments were at least a month 
away. Suspects could face charges 
of mail fraud, wire fraud, racket
eering and trading-law violations.

In a Student Senate referen
dum which was a part of early 
Decembers Senate elections, 
over half of the students who 
responded agreed with Senates 
current policy of denying activi
ties fee funds to politically-oriented student organizations.
But many senators claim the 
results of the referendum are 
ambiguous, and some are talk
ing of pushing through a change 
to the Student Government 
Constitution in defiance of the 
student bodys apparent wishes.
The first and main question 
of the referendum stated Sen
ates current policy of prohibit
ing funding of political organi
zations, gave the definition of 
political organization as it 
appears in the Student Govern
ment Constitution, and asked 
students whether they felt 
Senate should fund political 
organizations according to the 
current definition. Unlike most 
referenda, a Senate referendum 
is non-binding, which means 
that senators are free to disre
gard the results.
Of the 7.5 percent of the stu
dent body that voted in the De
cember elections, 57.8 percent 
felt that Senate should not fund 
political organizations as cur
rently defined.
Senate, which allocates funds 
to non-political student groups 
from the $40 activities fee paid 
each semester by each full-time 
student, has decided in recent 
months that both CMUs chap
ter of Amnesty International 
and the Coalition for a Free 
South Africa (CFSA) should be 
classified as political organi
zations along with more tradi
tional political groups such as 
the College Republicans  a 
decision some students ques
tion.
Amnesty International is a 
world-wide human rights advo
cacy group. According to Coor
dinator Jill Moore, a sophomore, 
CMUs chapter boasts 75 mem
bers, any 25 of whom show up 
at biweekly meetings.
Besides educatingthemselves 
and others on human rights con
ditions in other parts of the 
world, CMU Amnesty members 
write letters once a month in 
behalf of prisoners of conscience 
in other countries. Moore esti
mates that the local chapter 
sends over 40 letters a month.
At least twice, CMU Amnesty
 which has an annual budget 
of about $600 derived from the 
sale of t-shirts and cookies  
has appeared before Student 
Senate seeking $150 a year for 
posters and other advertising. 
Both times, the group has been 
narrowly denied funding bePolitical Organization Referendum
The current Student Senate policy prohibits the funding of 
political organizations. The Student Government Constitution 
defines political organizations as follows:
A political organization is defined as a group whose primary 
purpose is political. Political is defined as:
An espousal of or action pertaining to specific philosophies, ide
ologies, or policies pertaining to government or law. An espousal of 
or action pertaining to specific positions on public issues. 
According to this definition I believe Student Senate:
should fund political 
organizations (42.2%)

Organizations may be broken down by those who discuss politi

advocating one side and those organizations who attempt to 
educate while advocating a particular ideology or philosophy. I 
believe the following types of organizations should be funded

cause Senate has classified it as

Amnesty members disagree 
with Senates classification. As 
far as the Senate definition of 
political goes, we fall under it, 
says Moore. But the basis of 
Amnestys work is that we are not

political. We do not support people 
of any one party or belief. 
Predictably, the funding of politi
cal groups has become a hot topic. 
Alpha Phi Omega, which runs 
Senate elections, did not officially 
hand out the referendum with each 
ballot. Instead, a pile of blank ref
erendum sheets was placed on 
the election table and students 
could take none or more than 
one.
In addition to the balloting 
irregularity, critics have raised 
questions regarding the valid
ity of the referendums word
ing.
Chuck Jainchill, a graduated 
senator who was the chair of 
Senates Funding and Recogni
tion committee last semester, 
claimed that the referendum 
was ambiguous and therefore 
useless in a recent Student Un
ion article. He and other critics 
have specifically criticized the 
referendums main question, 
charging that some students 
were voting against funding 
political organizations while 
others may have been voting to 
reject the definition of politi
cal organization.
Because of the criticism of 
the referendums wording and 
the irregularities associated 
with balloting, most senators 
agree the referendums results 
are likely to be thrown out.
H&SS senator Matt Ruben, 
who is the current chair of Sen
ates Rules Committee and thus 
a key player in any change of 
the Constitution, feels that all 
political organizations should 
receive activities fee funding. 
Students have all kinds of dif
ferent interests, he says, and 
if the students interests hap
pen to be what Senate now calls 
political, they shouldnt be rele
gated to second-class citizen
ship  they should be able to 
get funding.
Spirit President and newlyelected senator Nicole Austin, 
a senior, agrees with Ruben. I 
personally think that every stu
dent pays a fee, and they should 
be allowed to do whatever with 
it. The whole purpose of a uni
versity is to give students an 
open-minded, liberal forum.
Ruben and Austin argue that 
all student organizations are to 
some extent political. They 
mention CMUs Student 
Pugwash, an educational group 
dealing with technology-related 
ethical issues, as an example of 
a group that is partly political 
yet receives funding. And they 
point out that both The Tartan 
and the Student Union regu
larly express editorial opinions 
dealing with political issues, yet 
receive funds.
An Amnesty member, Ruben 
worked to get the referendum 
on the ballot and was disap
pointed by the results. It didnt 
come out too well, he admits. 
Of course, any motive you have 
on a referendum assumes people 
will vote your way. Ruben and 
other liberal senators hope to 
spearhead a movement this se
mester to change Senates fund
ing policy.
In all likelihood, Ruben will 
seek the help of a more moder
ate group of senators who favor 
funding some, but not all, politi
cal organizations.
Frank DiVito, an H&SS so
phomore senator .recently se
lected to succeed Jainchill as 
the head of the influential Fund
ing and Recognition committee, 
believes that Senate should set 
some criteria for funding politi
cal organizations: I think theres 
good reasons to fund groups with 
educational purposes  like 
Amnesty and Educational Ac
tion on Latin America.
However, DiVito does not favor 
funding more outright political 
groups like the College Demo
crats.
However, not all senators 
agree that the current policy 
should be changed, and the re
cent referendum tends to sup
port them. Carlos Franco, an 
outspoken conservative H&SS 
senator, fears that funding po
litical groups would be too costly. 
If you started to fund political 
groups, youd add ten more or
ganizations, he says. I dont 
think we have the money.
Franco doesnt support fund
ing only groups with educational 
purposes, either, because he 
feels the definition of educa
tional is vague. The Democrats 
and the Republicans are out to 
educate people, but theyre out 
to educate them the way they 
want them to be educated.
I know the issue is going to 
come up, says Ruben. To effect 
a change of the Student Govern
ment Constitution, he, DiVito, 
and other supporters of funding 
for educational political organi
zations require a two-thirds 
majority in Senatewhich may 
be tough to come by. Ruben feels 
the political funding issue is 
going to be a difficult battle.
Franco agrees. I dont think 
theres widespread campus 
support for it  and Im going to 
fight it like hell.

IVIatthew Ruben
me New Senators
 By ERIC W. LEULIETTE
 Tartan Contributing Editor
I News Analysis
f With more than a dozen new 
faces on Student Senate after the 
I fall elections, many Senators feel 
that the group has become a more 
[ liberal and politically aware body. 
Though there is no consensus on 
>the cause of the high turnover of 
senators, many agree that be[ cause of it, the issues in and effec
tiveness of Senate will change 
I this semester.
Current Chair Glenn Kornbrek 
j sums up the prevailing sentiment: 
[I think Senate is a little more 
liberal. I think it is not that in the 
past Senate was more conserva
tive, but more non-political. He 
and several other Senators feel 
that the resolution on the Gay 
Rights Ordinance, which Senate 
approved last semester, is an in
dication of Senates new, more 
politically-oriented attitude.
H&SS Senator Matt Ruben,
1 who introduced the resolution, 
doesnt believe that Senate is 
necessarily more liberal, but 
contends that Senate is now A 
better balanced body.... Theres 
not as much complacency as there 
usfed to be. Theres a lot of poten
tial for people to become active.
Optimism about Senates ac
tiveness is echoed by several other 
senators. When I was a freshman, students here viewed Sen
ate as a thing people wanted to 
get on to add to their resum. But 
now Senate is getting to be much 
more vocal and more sensitive, 
comments senior Nicole Austin, a 
new senator representing H&SS.
There is little agreement as to 
why there was such a high turn
over in Senate. We had a turn
over like this two or three years 
ago.... I think one turnover spawns 
another one, says Kornbrek, who 
is a senior. Several positions
opened because of graduating 
senators, and many senators did 
not seek re-election because of 
time constraints and academics.
Senator Carlos Franco of H&SS 
does not believe these are the 
only reasons for the loss of sena
tors. Several Senators resigned 
citing academic reasons. I think 
they got frustrated with the inef
fectiveness of Senate.
Austin finds the change in 
Senate encouraging. As far as 
the turnover is concerned, many
students who may have shied 
away from Senate in the past are 
looking twice at Senate and say
ing This is the kind of organiza
tion I want to become a part of.  
Austin doesnt feel that the new 
members will reduce Senates 
effectiveness. Some of the new 
senators are people who are aware 
of who to go to [in the administra
tion], she says. Indeed, she feels 
that any problems with inexperi
ence will be balanced by the en
thusiasm of the new Senators.
Kombreks main concern is with 
inexperience in committees. I do 
expect some difficulties. Theres 
been a big turnover in chairman
ships of committees, which is more 
significant than changes in indi
vidual members. He hopes to 
meet regularly with committee 
chairmen to combat any problems 
with inexperience and to better 
organize Senate.
Ruben, one of only three sena
tors re-elected in the fall, thinks 
that many senators dont know
each other well, but hopes that a < 
retreat scheduled for this week; 
end will help. a
Franco feels that the new ' 
members will add different per
sonal agendas to Senate. They 
will definitely change the tone.  
Indeed, Austin has new topics 
for Senate. She intends to pursue 
the issues of ethnic diversity and 
student teaching assistants. r.
Im expecting a lot of positive A 
things to happen this year, says t 
Austin.
Carnegie Mellon finalizes School of Computer Science creation
By JAMES B. ENDRES
Tartan Staffwriter
In a move to assert its leadership in the 
field of Computer Science, Carnegie 
Mellon officially created the School of 
Computer Science on December 1. SCS 
is little more than a reorganization of the 
formerly existing Department of Com
puter Science, and will be headed by 
Nico Habermann, the past head of the 
CS department.
In 1965, the Department of Computer 
Science was created under the Mellon 
College of Science. In 1985, that depart
ment was removed from MCS and given 
independent status, with the stipulation 
that it would remain a department for a
trial period of two or three years before it 
was promoted to a college.
Provost Angel G. Jordan commented, 
the [CS] department prospered ex
tremely well. It prospered so well that it 
actually grew, was enlarged, became 
prominent, and later, pre-eminent. 
Jordan said that Habermann is going 
to need two or three associate deans 
which de facto have already been active. 
When he was department head, he was 
already dean, because of thesize of the 
school and the components of the pro
gram. Now some people who were help
ing the department head will be ap
pointed associate deans.
According to Jordan, CMU was one of 
the first universities to create a depart
ment in the field of computer science 
back in the sixties and today is one of 
the first to give it full college status. 
Computer Science has for years at 
Carnegie Mellon University been more 
than just a little discipline in a con
glomerate of colleges, Jordan said.
The new school will include the com
ponents of the old department, as well 
as the Robotics Institute, the Center 
for Machine Translation, and the In
formation Technology Center, a CMU/ 
IBM joint project responsible for the 
familiar Andrew system.
However, SCS will not be organized 
into departments.
PhD degrees in computer science 
and robotics and intelligent systems,
and new MS degrees in computer science 
and software engineering will be offered by 
the school.
In addition to these graduate programs, 
SCS will continue to jointly offer an under
graduate degree in mathematics/computer 
science through the Department of Mathe
matics in MCS.
However, the new school is still only a 
graduate school. Since theres already an 
undergraduate computer science option in 
mathematics, the idea is to work closely 
with the Department of Mathematics in 
making a joint program in mathematics 
and computer science, explained Jordan.
Jordan cited other areas of the univer
sity where the School of Computer Science 
would be collaborating with other schools
and departments. He mentioned compur 
tational physics, chemistry, and biology 
in MCS, computational linguistics in o 
H&SS, and the Center for Art and Tech
nology in CFA as likely collaborators s 
with SCS. i1
Habermann explained the reasoning i 
behind the formation of SCS: Informa
tion processing has added an extra di_ 
mension to the pursuit of science, while _ 
also being a separate discipline for study. 
With the advent of economical personal 
computers and workstations, along with 
networking, computer science has be
come the tool of thought.
The School of Computer Science is 
Carnegie Mellons third graduate school, 
joining GSIA and SUP A.
GSIA counter-attacks Business Week
continued from page 1
rankings are done based on the quality of faculty 
as determined by a group of experts, most often 
business school deans. BW wanted its survey to 
reflect the two markets the schools serve  
students and businesses.
Business Week contacted recruiters from 265 
companies that hire students from at least eight 
of 23 top business schools. The companies were 
chosen on a representative basis from different 
industries, with the majority coming from fi
nance and consumer products. Recruiters ranked 
Northwestern first and Carnegie Mellon twelfth.
The magazine also contacted 3000 randomly 
chosen graduates of the same 23 schools. The 
graduates were sent a 35-question survey which 
asked them to rank, on a l-to-10 scale, the quality 
of teaching, curriculum, placement, and other 
facets of their schools. The graduates chose Dart
mouth as the best and placed CMU ninth.
In Baybars response, the sampling and survey 
methodology were criticized: [The survey] was 
so unscientific that-BW should be embarrassed.
According to the GSIA paper, the mix of recruit
ers surveyed does not match the mix of recruiters 
who come to GSIA. Baybars also faulted the 
selection of companies that recruit at one-third of
the schools studies  a selection, he asserts, 
which favors the larger schools because a com
pany is more likely to go there. GSIA was the 
smallest school listed in the top 20, less than onefifth the size of Harvard or Wharton.
Baybars also criticizes the surveys 
methodology. Business Week issued a students 
report card along with the survey. Schools were 
given grades ofA to D in teaching, curriculum, 
and placement. The top four schools in each 
category received As, the next 5 Bs, the next 7 
Cs, and the rest Ds. Carnegie Mellon received 
a C in teaching, D in curriculum, and a B in 
placement. Baybars remarked that students 
would not stand for such a grading scale.
Baybars feels that the effect of the survey upon 
applications will be minimal. We have a large 
number of activities in cities nationwide where 
we communicate about the school very effec
tively.
To prevent future problems, GSIA hopes to 
become more aggressive in its public relations. It 
will also use the B W report to spur improvements 
in curriculum design, teaching, and placement. 
It also plans to give six units of credit to any stu
dent who analyzes the survey and can propose a 
better way to evaluate and rank business schools.

who will create some incentive 
system for teachers, said Rao.
According to Student Govern
ment President Andy Robitshek, 
who helped organize the commit
tee, large organizations nomi
nated members to get a crosssection of the student body.
The organizations that were to 
provide students for this commit
tee were selected with input from 
the Faculty Senate, the Vice Presi
dent of Enrollment, and Student 
Government, said Robitshek.
However, opponents to the com
mittee contend that it will not 
adequately represent the needs 
of the student body. The people 
who deserve the representation 
are the academic groups and the 
large special interest groups be
cause they have more at stake 
than someone just involved in an 
extra-curricular activity, said 
Matt Ruben, a student senator.
The committees chair, on the 
other hand, thinks that the cur
rent membership will recommend 
a good candidate and make the 
students concerns heard. By 
picking representatives from 
large organizations and doing a
lot of background and out-of-committee work, we can make a dif
ference on the steering commit
tee, said Rao.
Saying she would promote the 
interests of her organization, 
Spirits Watson said she sought a 
president who would continue the 
human relations work Cyert has 
started. We want someone who 
is going to be sensitive to the 
needs of all students, she said.
This groups first meeting was 
scheduled for yesterday.
After an emotional farewell 
speech to a faculty meeting last 
Wednesday, Cyert told reporters 
that Angel Jordan, provost, 
Granger Morgan, head of the 
Department of Engineering and 
Public Policy, Robert Sekerka, 
Dean of MCS, and Stephen Fienberg, Dean of H&SS, were candi
dates for the presidency.
Though none have formally 
asked to be considered for the job, 
Cyert said that each has requested 
not to serve on the search com
mittees. However, just as if they 
were not affiliated with the Uni
versity, the internal candidates 
will have to undergo the entire 
search process.
In no sense does this mean 
that they have the inside track, 
but they do want to be considered 
for the position just like anyone 
from outside of the University, 
said Vice President for Univer
sity Relations Don Hale.
Before a final decision is made, 
the search committees expect to 
consider several hundred candi
dates, according to Fetkovich.
Standing Ovation
Following a short introduction 
by Fetkovich, Cyert, 67, gave his 
farewell speech to a packed Skibo 
Ballroom, which sent him off with 
a standing ovation Wednesday.
Saying it would be easy to look 
back but instead stressing the 
future, Cyert delivered most of 
the speech in his standard, un
emotional style  until he tried 
to say good-bye at the end.
With tears in his eyes, Cyert 
said, It is not an easy decision for 
me to leave a job... and then 
broke off.
Stepping back to the micro
phone and softly apologizing, 
Cyert started again, It is not an 
easy decision for me to leave a job

burgh, that blacks would be rep
resented by one city councilman,

Bowman also spoke of the need 
for immediate action in dealing 
with the problems of todays soci
ety, and of the economic problems 
associated with getting minori
ties a higher political and eco
nomic status: As we can see with 
Jessie [Jackson], he said, its 
nice to have the message, but 
youve got to have the money. 
The keynote address was given 
by David Bartlett, a PhD candi
date in CMUs History Depart
ment. Bartletts speech, while no 
less reverent than the other talks, 
was different in its approach.
Speaking without written notes, 
Bartlett gave a personalized ac
count of King, stating, We tend 
i to overly deify a historical indi
vidual, in this case Martin Lu
ther King. Theres a problem with 
that kind of deification. For one 
thing, it tends to de-emphisize 
the best qualities in any human 
being, the qualities that anyone 
can emulate, such as persever
ance despite defeat
King was chosen to lead the 
civil rights movement in 
Montgomery not merely because 
he was a powerful speaker and a 
man of high ideals, but also be
cause he was a black leader who
had not been in Montgomery long 
enough to become embroiled in 
any conflicts with either white or 
black leaders there, said Bartlett.
Bartlett also stressed that it 
was Kings ability to communi
cate with many divergent groups 
of people and to unite them in 
pursuit of a common cause that 
was his true forte.
Bartlett summarized his view

style, not only as a speaker to 
large groups of people but as a 
persuader to other leaders.
After Bartletts speech, C-MAP 
Director Gloria Hill challenged

which I love. My heart tells me to 
stay on and on, but my brain tells 
me that the time to leave has 
come.
With a wave to the crowd, Cyert 
left the stage. No one remained 
seated.
During his speech, the presi
dent, ever the organizational 
behaviorist, outlined a path for 
the Universitys future:
It would be easy, at this point, 
to become nostalgic and to look 
back at our days of poverty with 
the self-satisfaction of people who 
have achieved success after a 
childhood of deprivation, but 
organizations, like individuals, do 
not achieve by looking backward. 
No matter how much we have 
accomplished over the last six
teen years, we must have the 
mental toughness to look forward 
to see all that we must do.
In particular, Cyert said that 
the University needs to improve 
teaching, maintain its commit
ment to computing, continue re
search, acquire more space, and 
build a larger endowment.
Someone once posed the prob
lem of how to describe Carnegie 
Mellon in one word. It was gener
ally agreed that striving5 was that 
word. I like that description, 
Cyert said.  Striving to me im
plies a forward-looking, harddriving, energetic organization, 
and that is the way I hope we can 
keep this organization.
Cyerts speech was well received 
by students and faculty alike.
He talked more about the fu
ture than about the past, which I 
thought was a nice touch. Hes 
accomplished a great deal here 
and he had a perfect opportunity 
here today to crow about his ac
complishments but he passed that 
opportunity by and chose to con
centrate on what he would like to 
see as the future of Carnegie 
Mellon, said Fetkovich.
Cyert is an economics instruc
tor who joined the faculty in 1948 
and served ten years as the dean 
of GSIA before being appointed 
president. He plans to return to 
GSIA as a full-time teacher and 
researcher.
Cyerts Legacy
CMUs sixth president, Cyert 
was appointed after H. Guyford 
Stever, president from 1965 to
1972. As president, he is credited 
with returning CMU to financial 
solvency, stimulating huge 
growth in research, and strength
ening its educational programs.
During his tenure as president, 
applications for admission have 
increased by 350 percent to more 
than 7,000 in 1988, and funded 
research jumped 850 percent from 
about $13 million to more than 
$111 million last year.
A Navy officer in World War II, 
Cyert earned his PhD from Co
lumbia University in 1951 and 
his bachelors degree from the 
University of Minnesota in 1943.

ing that there either was or was 
not discrimination.
Brannick says that a success
ful conciliation is unlikely in 
this case. If the Department of 
Education rules that Carnegie 
Mellon did discriminate against 
the student it can either turn 
the case over to the Depart
ment of Justice for prosecution 
or give the University an oppor
tunity for a hearing before a 
judge, who would have the op
tion of ordering a partial or total
termination of federal funding to 
Carnegie Mellon.
Brannick feels that the discrimi
nation complaint is unfounded. 
As far as Im concerned, and 
looking at the facts as I see them, 
there is no discrimination on our 
part when I relate the facts to the 
current status of the law, he said
Sanford Rivers, the associate 
director of undergraduate admis
sions, was surprised by the accu

FORUM
JBl nl'c oilge7lncO
As President Richard Cyert said in 
his farewell address last week, we 
must look to the future in the face of 
his departure.
We must select a new president.
However, before the various search 
committees consider the myriad of 
candidates who are expected to ap
ply or be nominated, we need to 
consider what kind of individual we 
are looking for.
In 1972, Carnegie Mellon was a 
different school in need of different 
leadership. Cyert pursued his vision 
of a Universityone which included 
excellence in research and a focus on 
a professional education. Now, after 
.16 years of rapid progress, a new ad
ministration is in order.
Toward this end, we have come up 
with a few characteristics and objec
tives the new president should have:
Commitment to undergraduate 
teaching. Despite Carnegie Mellons 
standing as a research institution, 
Cyert has stressed solidundergraduate teaching, promoting the Teach
ing Center and Faculty Course Evalu
ations. The new president, whom
ever that may be, should continue 
where Cyert has left off.
Communication skills. Cyerts 
best speech was his last. While this 
is not to say that he is a bad speaker, 
Cyerts presentations were some
times lifeless  bordering on boring 
- because of his detached, second
hand style. Unfortunately, what he 
said was often lost in how he said it. 
In addition, Cyert often didnt com
municate to students what he had 
done for students even if he had made 
a significant change to help them.
High visibility. Universities take 
on their presidents personality. For
16 years, this university has been led 
by an economic intellectual who put 
academics ahead of everything else, 
including school spirit and image. 
Its time for a president who walks 
across campus, goes to the games, 
and talks to students outside of 
Warner Hall.
Commitment to unifying the 
campus. We have some of the best 
individual departments in the world, 
yet few students take advantage of 
the inter-disciplinary opportunities 
that this school presents. Instead of 
specializing, we should be allowed to 
get a more rounded education 
through the Universitys unique 
specialties.
 Human relations. Sadly, this past 
semester has demonstrated that 
Carnegie Mellon has serious human 
relations problems. Again, as with 
teaching, Cyert has made steps to 
cure these problems but unless the 
next president follows through on 
Cyerts programs we will still have a 
problem.
 Commitment to extra-curricular 
activities. Education is not exclu
sively a classroom experience, yet 
too often Carnegie Mellon accentu
ates academics and leaves out life. 
With this in mind, the new president 
should emphasize involvement in 
activities and leave students time to 
learn how to live while maintaining 
a balance with academics.
While these considerations are 
admittedly only the first steps down 
a long road, the search committees 
will have to face these issues and 
many more like them before making 
a final decision. We only hope that 
the committees decisions are as good 
as the ones made in 1972.
Amnesty deserves Senate funding
In early December, Student Senate 
put a referendum on the ballot ask
ing students whether or not student 
political organizations should receive 
funding. The results of the referen
dum are debatable, and Senate seems 
set to throw out the results.
But one group has been unfairly 
linked to the entire political organi
zation issue, and its time to clear 
the air.
Carnegie Mellons chapter of Am
nesty International is an educational 
and humanitarian group boasting 
75 student members that has been 
denied $150 worth of activities fee 
funding because Senate says its 
political.
Thats simply not true. Half the 
purpose of Amnesty is to educate  
to educate Carnegie Mellon students 
on human rights conditions in other 
countries.
The other half of Amnestys pur
pose is to write letters in behalf of

specific prisoners of conscience in 
other parts of the world. That in
cludes political prisoners, but it also 
includes religious prisoners and 
ethnic prisoners.
Amnesty is particular about remain
ing apolitical. In their letters, mem
bers support individuals, not poli
cies. They act as humanitarians, not 
political activists.
The distinction is important. 
Senates definition of political con
tains the words ideologies and 
policies. Amnesty does not attempt 
to change either ideologies or poli
cies in other countries.
Student Senate says that a group 
whose primary purpose is political 
should not receive funding. Fine. But 
if Amnesty is political at allwhich 
we doubt  it certainly is not pri
marily political.
We at The Tartan strongly support 
Amnestys work. Lets give the group 
the money it deserves.
Editor:
As a member of the Airband KISS and 
an ATO brother, I am writing in re
sponse to Kevin Barneys letter, [ATO 
and airband not a good mix 11/22] which 
appeared in the last issue ofThe Tartan.
My initial reaction to the letter was 
saturated with vengeance: I wanted to 
find Mr. Barney and smash his face, a 
typical ATO reaction. Yet I managed 
to collect myself and with the use of the 
Rogerian method of argument, I will 
attempt to explain the bands and broth
ers position.
The editorial states that the recording 
of the live version of I W ant to Rock and 
Roll All Night was of poor quality. This 
is true. The reason for this is that the 
record we used for the recording was 
slightly scratched. Because this album 
appeared in 1979 and is no longer as 
popular as it once was, we werent able 
to find one of better quality.
To further the unconstructive criti
cism, Mr. Barney finds fault in the ATO 
brothers for singing along and then 
screaming and shouting at the end of our 
act. This is ludicrous. Question 1: If the 
recording was of such unbearable qualLetters to the Editor
ity, why was Mr. Barney annoyed at my 
brothers sing-along? Question 2: Has he 
ever considered that their reaction was 
out of sheer enthusiasm and support of 
our KISS act?
My initial reaction to the 
letter was saturated with 
vengeance. I wanted to 
find Mr. Barney and 
smash his face....
The main 
reason for our 
performance 
was to remi
nisce over our 
childhood 
years when 
KISS was the 
greatest band 
in the music 
world. This is fi5fi555j^665 
exactly what
we accomplished, as was evident by the 
applause we received from our brothers. 
What did Mr. Barney want the ATO 
brothers to do: not cheer for their own 
brothers? Mr. Barneys argument on this 
matter is asinine.
Referring to Mr. Barneys comment on 
the commendable behavior of DU, more
power to them. But, we couldnt care less 
how DU or any other fraternity acted or 
acts on such occasions.
Nonetheless, we realize our faults and 
apologize for our lack of manners when 
Ron Darian was on stage.
In addition, the band members are 
sorry for accidentally leaving our make
up material 
in the rear of 
the ballroom.
My final 
question is 
directed to 
Kevin Bar
ney. Why 
couldnt you 
simply ap
proach and 
kindly ask my 
brothers to
keep it down while Ron Darian was doing 
his performance? MY brothers would 
have gladly cooperated without, and I 
emphasize, without, any further devel
opments.

When I was home for Christmas break, 
my younger brother, who is now a junior 
in high school, told me that he thought 
he might want to come to Carnegie 
Mellon for college. This is my reply to 
him:
Dear Jonathan,
I was very happy to hear that you 
might be interested in attending Carne
gie Mellon. I only wish that I would be 
here an extra year so that we could have 
the fun of going to college together.
Fun is a big part of college, Jon, and by 
going to Carnegie Mellon you will give 
yourself the opportunity to have a lot of
fun. Of course, --------------------------------
this will only be 
an opportunity, 
not a guaran
tee. Youll have 
to make a lot of 
the fun your
self, but there 
are plenty of
places to do this ______________________
at CMU.
First of all, 
theres the Greek system, which has 
been especially fulfilling for me. I dont 
think you could find a less stereotypical 
Greek system at any other school. Of 
course, there are problems with being 
Greek: many students like to stereotype 
and put down the Greeks, we are often 
made scapegoats for other problems, and 
our housing is definitely sub-standard. 
Also, many professors are very preju
diced against Greeks. You will probably 
come up against some of this prejudice, 
but persevere, the fraternity system is 
wonderful at CMU and I would defi
nitely urge you to rush.
Of course, there are some minuses to 
being a CMU student. You will work as 
hard or harder than your friends who eo 
to Ivy League schools, and you will be 
expected to do even more. Often you will 
not get credit for all your hard work, and 
you will have to compete with people for 
whom studying is their entire life. Again, 
persevere, while it never really gets any

easier, you get more used to it, and over
coming these difficulties will make you a 
stronger student and a better person in 
the end.
For the first time in your career as a 
student (if your term in high school was 
anything like mine) you will come up 
against overt and spoken (and generally 
leftward) biases. Whereas teachers in 
good old Ocean Township High School 
attempted to present both sides of most
You may even come upon teachers $ as I 
did with a grad student teaching my freshman 
English course $ who will mark you lower for 
having opinions that conflict with their own. 
issues, professors are CMU are often 
outright biased and not afraid to argue 
for their side. You may even come upon 
teachers  as I did with a grad student 
teaching my freshman English course  
who will mark you lower for having opin
ions that conflict with theirs. This is 
something that will probably continue to 
rankle you (if you feel the way I do) 
throughout your college career. Theres 
not much to do except stick to your guns 
and try to find the right answers on your 
own without accepting someone elses 
ideology. But when you come to your 
conclusions, you will feel more strongly 
about them for having developed them 
on your own, without having to accept 
spoon-feeding from a professor.
Reading back over this letter, it looks 
as if there are a lot of minuses to being a 
CMU student. Maybe there are. But I 
have never wanted to leave because of 
the one enormous plus that overrides all 
the minuses.
Its the people, Jon. Here at Carnegie 
Mellon there is an incredibly large col
lection of three-dimensional people. The 
people you will meet at CMU do not fit 
into molds. In my four years here, I have 
met excellent football players who like to 
write poetry and argue Plato. I have met 
fabulous athletes who are A students. 
I have met every combination of suppos
edly conflicting traits that you can imag
ine. I have met real people.
The typical Carnegie Mellon student 
is an individual, not part of a flock. He or 
she is concerned with success and excel
lence, but is still interested in fun. There 
are students with every interest and 
every viewpoint you can imagine. Of
---------------------------- course, there are
people who will ag
gravate the hell out 
you, poseur writers 
and stereotypical 
sensitive artists, 
bigots, and people 
who are just plain 
jerks, but you can
_________________ do as I do  look
down on and ignore 
them. They are in 
the minority and are not the students 
who are the heart and soul of CMU.
All college catalogs tout diversity as 
one of their institutions attributes, but 
CMU actually delivers on this promise. 
This is the real reason to come to Carne
gie Mellon, not the various educational 
programs, not the facilities or the faculty 
or the alleged value of the degree. It is a 
reason to put up with a substandard 
gym, an administration and a vocal mi
nority of the students who revile the 
Greek system, a sometimes disinterested 
faculty, and an often crushing workload. 
The people that you meet at CMU are the 
best, I really believe that.
Take good care, I hope to hear from you 
soon.
Love, your brother,
Michael

Eight years ago, the lunch bell 
,ng and I shuffled into Roosev;.Wilson High School knowing 
jat the Reagan Revolution was 
.ginning. Ever since that cold, 
oUdy day, Ive been collecting 
uotes from the Gipper.
After all, this was the man who 
declared that trees caused 
lore pollution than cars and 
itered the famous words, I paid 
this microphone, during the 
0 campaign.
Some of his promises were ironic 
ily later. An easy pick is the 
udget deficit: Balancing the 
jdget is like protecting your 
jrtue: you have to learn to say 
Just say no, eh?
And the anti-communist who 
sited the Peoples Republic of 
Hina during the 1984 campaign, 
jwed in 1978, It is absolutely 
ntrue that I am going to Peking

its friends on Taiwan or weaken 
our mutual defense treaty with 
them.
But what always amazed me 
was the Great Communicators 
ability to explain complex foreign 
policy decisions so that the com
mon man, like me, could under
stand. Take for instance his ex
planation for why 241 Marines 
were killed by a terrorist bomb
ing in Lebanon: Anyone thats 
ever had their kitchen done over 
knows that it never gets done as 
soon as you wish it would.
And he swifty explained his 
policy in Grenada by stating, It 
is not nutmeg that is at stake in 
the Caribbean and Central Amer
ica. It is the United States na
tional security.
But sometimes Reagan scared 
me (especially after I registered 
for the Selective Service). He had 
this nasty habit of sounding 
hauntingly like another presi
dent. President Lyndon B. 
Johnson on Vietnam, October, 
1964: We are not about to send 
American boys nine or ten thou
sand miles away from home to do 
what Asian boys ought to be 
doing.
President Ronald W. Reagan 
on Nicaragua, March 1986: We 
send money and material now, so 
well never have to send our own 
American boys.
On a much lighter note, I was 
not surprised at all by the astrol
ogy scandal. When Reagan was 
asked about psychics, he replied, 
Ive found it difficult to write 
them off entirely. The Scriptures
say there will be such people. 
But by far the best moments of 
his presidency were his micro
phone tests before his Saturday 
radio addresses. Everyone re
members, My fellow Americans, 
Im pleased to tell you today that 
Ive signed legislation that would 
outlaw Russia forever. We begin 
bombing in five minutes.
But my personal favorite was 
an earlier mike test, when Re
agan said, My fellow Americans, 
yesterday the Polish government, 
a military dictatorship, a bunch 
of no good lousy bums...
So, I will miss quoting the old 
Gipper now that hes back in 
California. Ah, but theres always 
Dan Quayle.

anymore. Mighty Mouse was 
censored when people saw our 
hero laying in a field of flowers 
and not wanting to do anything. 
They thought this symbolized 
cocaine use. Good thing these guys 
werent around when Dorothy fell 
asleep in a field of poison poppies.
 They also have a cartoon with 
Ed Grimley. Thats very decent of 
them. I must say.
 About the only fun cartoon I 
saw over the vacation was The 
Real Ghostbusters with Slimer.
The hungry green ghost has a 
name now and they treat it like a 
pet. A far cry from when it was the 
first ghost they caught.
Some things that you have to 
wonder about when you got back:
 Why did they rename the base
ment classes in Porter (19a, 19b 
to al9a, al9b) and forget to tell 
anyone?
Why did they rename 
the basement classes in 
Porter and forget to tell 
anyone?
 Same thing with Baker a36. 
Thats the Adamson Wing to you 
and me.
 After last years campaign to 
keep the gym open later, people 
still cant continue to use all the 
rooms until midnight; they get 
tossed into the locker rooms at 
11:30.
0 With all the improvements to 
Tartan Grill there is still one thing 
that a few people I know would 
like changed: the exit doors. Keep
ing them locked in this cold 
weather is cruel and unusual pun
ishment for Tartan Grill goers.
 I think the new Grill is pretty 
decent. Getting food takes about 
a tenth of the time it used to take.

In my continuing series on 
'hite-collar crime  a subject I 
ill be dealing with through much 
1989  I am happy to report 
lat justice is being served 
j.cause these criminals are being 
intenced to community service 
ither that to jail. So much so 
lat there is now a shortage of

Only last week a gentleman in 
Ralph Lauren double-breasted ' 
and cashmere sweater, 
>lding a mop in one hand and a 
lueegee in the other, appeared 
my doorstep.
How do you do, sir he said. I 
n a former president of a Texas 
wings and load association, and 
wbezzled the whole stack from
IV depositors. I was given a 
oice of 20 years in prison or 
lng 1,000 hours of community 
^ice. I chose the latter and I 
ls wondering if I could wash 
ur car.
Thats very kind of you, I told 
m' But we had a convicted felon 
oni one of New Yorks largest 
pkerage houses wax our car 
sterday. He was working off 
j0 hours in order to pay his 
bt to society.
Perhaps then, the S&L 
ecutive said, I could clean your 
ndows. I believe I am the only 
Me-collar criminal who does 
ndows.
I m sure you do good work. But 
dont really need any windows 
lshed today.
Art Buchwald
hate to beg, but if I dont put in 
five community service hours by 
the end of the day, the judge will 
send me to jail. How about letting 
me shovel snow from your walk? 
But it isnt snowing.
The court will never know, he 
said.
Thats perjury, which probably 
got you
hours to complete.
After you have finished with 
the trash, my neighbor, Robert 
Parrish, needs his gutters 
painted.
I do not do gutters. But I have 
a friend putting in seven hundred 
hours for illegal computer entry, 
and he is a whiz with a paintbrush. 
He loves it so much that when his 
sentence is up, he is thinking of 
asking the judge if he can stay on 
marking lines down the middle of 
the road.
Theman sounded nervous, I
where you

a sentence 
like this is

Absolutely, he agreed. But 
how can I do it if no one will let me 
perform the work? I am also a 
trash manthe best in the Sixth 
Circuit Court.
We could use someone to 
handle trash. But youre a whitecollar criminal. How do we know 
you wont come into our home 
and juggle our household account 
books while were not watching? 
Trust me. Ever since I have 
had to cut lawns, Ive realized the 
folly of putting large sums of other 
peoples money into my own 
account. Nobody who has ever 
cleaned toilets in community 
service goes back to a life of crime 
again.
You sound contrite, I 
admitted. And I think it is only 
fair that we give you a chance to 
rehabilitate yourself. But if you 
try to open so much as one Swiss 
bank account while you do work 
for us, I will see that you never do 
an hour of community service 
again.

break in the burbs was about 
as exciting as a Technology and 
People lec__________________
ture.
After 
youre 
home for a 
while, you 
start to 
realize 
things. 
For example,
In one show we had 
invalids, nudists and 
the mentally handi
capped....
LSAT instead of the GMAT, 
and filled out law school appli
cations instead of business 
school applications. I never 
knew that law was such an ex
citing field. In the first five 
minutes of the show, one law
yer visits a nudist colony and 
interviews Miss Nude Galaxy, 
in the costume she won her 
award in. No, I dont think that 
things like that happen too 
often on Wall Street.
--------------------------- After the
commer
cials we go 
to the 
firms 
morning 
meeting. It 
was over in 
less than 
two min
utes. Ive
your parents love to tell their 
friends that you go to Carnegie 
Mellon. They also love to tell 
them how much theyre paying 
to keep you here. Things also 
start to appear in your room as 
it turns into a carpeted garage.
Even though Ive been in col
lege for four years, some things 
never change. As soon as I got 
sick of the house, I ran to the 
first place I could  the mall. 
However, I have learned one 
thing at CMU. Once you get 
into college, there are only so 
many times you can go to the 
mall in one week.
In search of something to do 
in that final week, I tried some
thing Id been putting off - I 
watched an episode ofL.A. Law. 
Most of The Tartans editorial 
board already watches it, so I 
figured I would give it a try. If 
nothing else, its proof that at 
least two Carnegie Mellon 
graduates can find work.
If Id watched it last year, I 
probably wouldve taken the
never been in a meeting any
where that ended that quickly. 
Considering everything that 
was going on at the office, I 
couldnt believe the meeting 
ended so early.
Lets see, there was the rightto-die case, an extremely un
usual love triangle, and the 
nudist colony case. In one show 
we had invalids, nudists, and 
the mentally handicapped; 
thats even better than A Cur
rent Affair.
I did have some problems 
with the show. It takes a lot of 
faith to make me believe that 
anyone who was on The Par
tridge Family would go to a 
nude party. And nude whiffle 
ball, I tried that after the show, 
and it really is a very danger
ous sport, especially if you play 
fast-pitch.
All in all, it was a decent way 
to spend a Thursday night. 
Though I dont think Ill be 
watching again soon, Im not 
450 miles from PHI anymore.
I said, What I like about you 
white-collar criminals is that once 
youre caught, you have a good 
attitude. You seem eager to carry 
out your sentence.
Community service may not 
be the same as working for Merrill 
Lynch, he replied, but it beats 
the hell out of making license 
plates in the big house.

English.should become 
official U.S. language
In shortOOO free 
communication OOO 
would be destroyed. 
Recent movements around the 
country have sought to make 
English the official language of 
the United States. Although I am 
concerned by the possible conse
quences for non-English speak
ers, I believe that the overall 
benefits of such proposals out
weigh the harms.
The United States was built by 
immigrants and this nations will
ingness to accept refugees from 
foriegn countries is one of our 
most important national values. 
Immigration has benefited not 
only the individuals who have 
come to this country, but also the 
United States itself by allowing it 
to become one of the most popu
lous and powerful nations in the 
world.
For these reasons, and because 
I believe that all people have the 
right to enjoy the freedom found
in the ------------------------------
United 
States, I do 
not believe 
in restrict
ing immi
gration, 
even in
these times of increasing compe
tition forjobs. However, it is only 
reasonable that people who wish 
to become U.S. citizens learn to 
operate within the system by 
which the country runs. Part of 
that system lies in the fact that 
the United States is, and always 
has been, an English-speaking 
country.
The fact that a country so large 
as the United States is so unified 
is remarkable. One of the comer. stones of this unity is the fact that 
the overwhelming majority ofits 
. citizens speak the same language.
, If this were not the case, the 
United States would be a very 
different country. The president 
would not be able to appear on 
television and communicate di
rectly with the entire country 
(unless we added the requirement 
that elected officials speak mul
tiple languages which would 
thereby exclude many qualified 
people from public service).
Similarly, high school students 
applying to colleges would have 
to eliminate those schools from 
consideration whose classes were 
conducted in the wrong language.
' Even interstate business trans
actions would be hampered by 
language barriers. In short, the 
free communication upon which 
this country depends would be 
destroyed.
To require that every conversa
tion held in the United States be 
held in English would be ridicu
lous (as well as unconstitutional).
Jonathan Levy
However, the individual states 
and the federal government can 
and should require all govern
ment activities to be conductedby 
English speakers. This does not 
mean that a person speaking only 
Spanish (or any other language) 
should be turned away from a 
government office if one of the 
employees does happen to speak 
his or her language. It simply 
means that knowledge of a for
eign language should not be a 
requirement for holding a gov
ernment job and that knowledge 
of English should be such a re
quirement.
Clearly, some people would be 
temporarily cut off from some 
government services and this is 
------------------------- unfortunate.
The alterna
tive, however, 
is to cut off 
current 
American citi
zens. If some 
group has to 
learn a new language, it is far 
more sensible for an incomingminority toleam one language than 
for the majority, who are already 
U.S. citizens, to leam the many 
different languages of people 
coming from around the world.

Atsl7p Bhiieranl oyapg uecc9nesacetn eg Blil
By DAVID N. LEVY
Tartan Contributing Editor
This has been a greatyear for 
animation. The success of Who 
Framed Roger Rabbit and Will 
Vintons Claymation has shown 
that animation is not just for 
the 22-minute commercials 
after 3 pm. There has even been 
a resurgence of animation di
rected at adults as more of it 
appears in commercials. Some 
Saturday morning cartoons 
have even made their story 
lines a little more grown-up.
Now the folks at Expanded 
Entertainment bring the Tart 
nCCoib ugoECdd gS nCepitegC 
to screens across the country, 
riding high on this enthusiasm 
for animation. In the third year 
of wide release, the only single 
word to describe the ugoECdd is 
fantastic. The Tart ugoECdd 
is the most well-rounded film 
of the trio including one short 
of almost every form of anima
tion, from stop-action to cel 
animation.
Thisyears festival, currently 
showing at the Pittsburgh Play
house, is more bittersweet than 
previous ones, with less of a 
slapstick approach and several 
genuinely moving entries.
The show starts with Candyjam, a salute to Anijam, a 
film where many different ani
mators contributed a segment 
of their work. In Candyjam, 
many animators contributed 
segments, but this time the 
(animation) medium is candy. 
The Claymation California 
Raisins wont be found here,
but youll find out what hap
pens when M&Ms land on your 
foot instead of in your mouth.
When the Bats are Quiet gives 
us a stormy night, a dead flash
light, and a house a lot like 
Norman Bates. This short is a 
good reason not to go into a 
house with only one light on.
Living in a Mobile Home is 
the most fun short of the film. 
Here we have an animated 
music video about the singers 
mother and her mobile home.
Commercials always act as a 
mainstay of animation, from 
Mr. Clean to Snuggles. In this 
part of the film we see a collec
tion of the works of Richard 
Williams, the animation direc
tor for Who Framed Roger Rab
bit.
Remember Mad magazine? 
Its still around, and so are those 
drawn-out dramas that inhab
ited the space between the 
panels. In case you dont re
member them or have a sudden 
craving for some, theyre here 
in Quinoscopio, an entry from 
Cuba.
Arnold Escapes from Church 
is the Claymation entry, al
though it doesnt come out of 
Will Vintons studio. It shows 
why little children can stand to. 
be in church during long 
prayers. It also received the 
1987 Academy Award for Best 
Animation Short.
Technological Threat is a com
bination of computer-generated 
and traditionally drawn figures. 
It shows that technology is not 
always the best answer.

No, they didnt name the hurricane after him, but 
| judging by his swift pace, radical action, and sheer 
power, Gilbert Gottfried might as well have been the 
f original item. The main difference is that Gottfried has 
i; a sense of humor. The other difference is that the 
\ hurricane wont be performing at the William Pitt Union 
t Assembly Room Thursday at 8:30.
One of the most unique comedians to surface in the last 
! few years, Gottfried has been seen most recently yelling 
i ecstatically about candy bars and microwave products 
S on television. The commercials demonstrate his delivf ery, but not his brilliance. In real life, he yells, scrunches 
[. his face up and sputters about much funnier things.
Gottfried first tried stand-up comedy as a teenager in 
| 1971. He found a place in the cast of the least popular 
f season of Saturday Night Live, 1980-81, after which he 
f became a cast member of the ill-fated Thicke of the 
[' Night. But dont let that checkered past fool you. He 
; continued to polish his stand-up comedy and moved on 
; to his own special on Cinemax as well as featured shots 
on MTV, where he perfectly embodied the frenetic,
; hold-me-back-and-Ill-bite-you MTV style.
I To compliment Gottfrieds style, the opening act will 
be Shang Forbes, also known as The Powercat of 
Comedy. Forbes prowls and stalks the laughs, pouncing 
[ on the punchlines with deadly accuracy. Even when he 
; strays into stock material, the Powercat still makes it 
; work, throwing in his trademark muscle pose to person! alize the jokes. Forbes is originally from Pittsburgh, but 
I he has recently moved to Los Angeles to enhance his 
I professional status.
! Since this is a college show and not another of Gottfrieds
 many comedy club showcase appearances, he will be 
; going back to some of the older material and characters 
that he perfected years ago. He now uses club dates to 
work on new material, refusing to do the old stuff even 
when people request it loudly.
Gottfrieds other recent comedic endeavors include his 
work as a National Lampoon contributing editor, and a 
book entitled How Not To Get Laid, in which he writes 
from personal experience, instructing men in the art of 
escaping sex. The Pitt Program Council is asking $8 a 
ticket for non-Pitt students. It may seem like a lot, but 
its the cheapest youll find for Gilbert Gottfried live.

Ballroom blast will 
rock campus Friday
By DAN BIDWA Their debut LP, Star Booty, was
Tartan Staffwriter
After many months of sur
veys and planning, three of the 
best bands in alternative music 
will be coming to campus this 
Friday, when Winterblast 
comes to the Skibo Ballroom, 
featuring Bitch Magnet, Naked 
Raygun, and Live Skull.
Winterblast is WRCTs at
tempt to expose the campus 
community to worthwhile new 
music that they wouldnt hear 
otherwise. At present, Pitts
burgh does not have a particu
larly sparkling club scene, so 
lesser-known bands are un
likely to get a gig unless they 
have at least one full album out 
and on the charts. Equally, the 
Classic Tracks format of most 
of Pittsburghs major radio 
stations locks out just about 
anything new or progressive. 
As a result, most bands have 
Pittsburgh marked with a big 
SKIP in their tour books. With 
fewer bands playing, and fewer 
being heard, the new music 
scene can easily drop into a 
vicious circle that disregards 
anything not on the charts, 
retail or otherwise.
Last year, WRCT tried to ease 
the dearth of new music by 
presenting a three-band 
gothic show in the Ballroom 
last year. A fair number of CMU 
students attended; however, 
many people at the station felt 
that the concert wasnt a fair 
representation of the prevalent 
opinion of the staff. So, when 
talk of a WRCT-sponsored con
cert started in September, a 
series of surveys were distrib
uted to all WRCT staff so that 
the entire station could decide 
which bands would be featured. 
When the dust cleared, the fi
nal choices were Charlotte, 
North Carolinas Bitch Magnet; 
Chicagos Naked Raygun; and 
New Yorks Live Skull.
Bitch Magnet, the youngest 
f the three, formed in 1986.
produced by soundmeister Steve 
Albini, and was released on 
Roman Candle Records last 
year. The band is a trio, with 
Orestes Delatorre on drums, 
Jonathan Fine on guitar, and 
Sooyoung Park on bass and 
vocals. Of the three bands, they 
are probably the closest to the 
college rock hyperbole, but 
only marginally  the noise is 
there, but is usually covered to 
some extent by melody. Bitch 
Magnet is punk rocks gifted 
child, with all the energy and 
more of the melody.
Started some time in 1981 as 
a punk/surf band, Naked 
Raygun has become one of the 
most popular punk bands. 
Known as much for their 
watchspring precision as for 
their heavy-duty power pop 
tunes, Raygun is on their third 
full LP, Jettison, with a sixsong EP and a few seven-inchers under their collective belts 
as well. Their earliest lineup in
cluded former Big Black-man 
Santiago Durango, but their 
present roster of John Haggerty 
on guitar, Pierre Kezdy on bass, 
Eric Spicer on drums, and Jeff 
Pezzati on vocals carries as 
much impact as ever. Too ener
getic for most radio stations, 
Naked Raygun is a excellent 
example of how punk rock has 
evolved over the years, expand
ing its musical boundaries with
out losing sight of its origins (or 
ever getting airplay).
They hate it, but Live Skull 
seem fated to be forever com
pared to Sonic Youth. The two 
bands are similar  both treat 
noise as viable instrumentation
 but Live Skull fills in the 
cracks with bits of funk whereas 
Sonic Youth pads their crib with 
Velvet. While some people will 
almost immediately decide that 
they dont like this band as soon 
as the first sound wave breaks, 
those who wade on in get to play 
around in the beauty and tencontinued on page 12
January Man gcaicg cBl plai Mitnv
By TODD VANDERHEYDEN
Special to The Tartan
Who said the straight-laced will 
inherit the earth? When the going 
gets weird, the weird turn pro. 
Kevin Kline is the cop with New 
Balance shoes and the zen of 
goofiness in The January Man, a 
Pat OConnor film produced by 
Norman Jewison.
A serial killer in New York City 
has murdered eleven women in 
as many months. After taking the 
rap for police corruption, Nick 
Starkey (Kline) is reluctantly 
reinstated in the force by his 
brother, Commissioner Frank 
Starkey (Harvey Keitel), who, 
incidentally, has also married 
Nicks former girlfriend, Christine 
(Susan Sarandon). Given carte 
blanche by Frank and Mayor 
Eamon Flynn (Rod Steiger), Nick 
questions the Mayors daughter 
(Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio), 
friend of the most recent victim, 
and, fifteen minutes later, winds 
up in bed with her. With the help 
of Nicks artist friend Ed (Alan 
Rickman), the pair race to dis
cover the killers modus operandi 
before he strikes again.
This film is particularly disap
pointing in that it starts out with 
a decent premise and good actors 
like Kline and Sarandon, but 
baffles the viewer with mixed 
signals and loose ends through 
poor dialogue and plot structure. 
Kline, as Nick, plays a cop who 
does things his own way and isnt 
afraid to seem a little vulnerable. 
But its never clear why the city 
needs this screwy investigator or 
why hes so special.
Kline really overdoes the sensi
tive male crap; at least Magnum 
P.I. knew when to get tough and 
when to whine. As Christine 
Starkey, Sarandon is just another 
bitch rented out from Dynasty. 
Her neck cords do most of the 
acting. Mastrantonios character, 
Bernadette Flynn, gives the im
pression of being capable and 
intelligent, but then folds flat for 
easy transport. The officials with

The January Man.
Keitel, and Danny Aiello (as Po
lice Chief Alcoa) do a lot of point
less ranting and are much less 
entertaining than their real-life 
counterparts. The only bright 
spot: Alan Rickman (last seen as 
Hans, the head terrorist in Die 
Hard) as Ed the weirder-thanthou artist. He steals more than a 
few scenes with little things:
mannerisms and charming 
crankiness.
The killing blow to January 
Man is its ambiguity. Are the 
inane dialogue and fight scenes 
meant to be funny, serious, or just 
tacky? In addition, important 
questions and plot points are 
murkily resolved at best. Patrons 
may wonder if the theater owner
perchance lost the last reel of the 
film.
The January Man is a bum way 
to start out the new movie year. It 
does a disservice to the eccentricbut-successful cop bit by putting 
more unoriginal mileage on the 
character. A last-minute script 
doctor might have revised and 
revived this film; too late.

Animation takes over at 
Pittsburgh Playhouse
continued from page 11
Ever see the Pope break dance? 
No? Then you havent seen Pas a 
Deux. Included in this package is 
a sophisticated dance performed 
by animated famous figures, from 
Mickey Mouse to Marilyn Monroe 
to John Wayne. How many people 
can you recognize?
The last and longest short in 
this film is The Man Who Planted 
Trees. After so many comedic 
episodes this film can turn some 
people away. Thats too bad be
cause it is an interesting use of 
slow animation and rough draw
ing. This could also be a real tear
jerker, but it does show that one 
man can make a difference.
There is also the obligatory Au
gusta short and a salute to the 
man who first showed pictures on 
the big screen  no, not Thomas 
Edison. All in all its more than an 
hour and a half of fun for anyone. 
If you have time this week or 
next, enjoy yourself. Also, get 
there early; shows are crowded.
The 21st Annual Tournee In 
Animation is showing at the Pitts
burgh Playhouse until February 
2, and will be on campus in May. 
For ticket and time information, 
call the Playhouse at 621-4445.

Leadership Excellence Starts Here
Every time you look around, 
theres an American institution 
under attack. This time its the 
sacred Warrior Girls, eight little 
jigglin cuties with yarn around 
their ankles and leotards that cut 
off the circulation in the aqualung 
water balloons they evidently 
have stuffed under their V-neck 
Star Trek tops, girls that can bend 
over backward so far they can 
kiss themselves on the stomach. 
And now people are writing p 
letters to the Golden State | 
Warriors saying that this  
particular talent is unsuitable for a basketball court  
because it is archaic and * 
sexist and they should take * 
their little tushies back to J 
Jack Lalanne Super Spa 
and Elephant-Milk Health Clinic 
where they belong.
To which I sayyou people are 
SICK. First of all, the Warriors 
management hired the Warrior 
Girls for a very good reason. This 
year, if you go to a Warriors game, 
you have to actually LOOK AT 
Manute Bol for a long time. 
Manute is the nine-foot-six cen
ter from some country in Africa 
who has beefed up this year to a 
good solid 65 pounds. The first 
game Manute ever played against 
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Kareem 
mistook him for a granddaddy 
long legs and tried to smush him 
with his right tennis shoe. Fortu
nately, Manute scurried out of 
the way, but Kareem got a double 
technical foul for insect-like 
eradication and was ejected from 
the game. Manute has these arms 
that look like the pole you use to 
clean out your swimming pool, so 
he blocks 27 shots a game, but he 
runs like a giraffe attempting to 
break-dance, so he never gets the 
ball back after he blocks it.
Anyhow, my point is, the War
riors management knew Manute 
was gonna hurt season ticket 
sales, not to mention the people 
that simply have to leave the 
arena every five minutes to throw 
back tequila shooters until they 
forget the image of Manute Bol 
butterflying down the court like a 
greyhound dog on twelve-foot 
stilts.
And so they hired the Warrior 
Girls for a little DIVERSION, for 
the moments when Manute has
to slide into the game to replace 
Ralph Sampson, so that people 
didnt puke their Super Dogs all 
over one another.
And by the way, while Im think
ing about it, it wasnt the people 
in Oakland that started whining 
about thisits THEIR coliseum, 
its THEIR goldurn teamit was 
the people over in San Francissy 
that dont have anything better to 
do than try to mess up a perfectly
good contract whereby Seagrams 
Wine Coolers pays these Warrior 
Gals to engrave its corporate logo 
on each gals inner thigh.
You know, we went through this 
same thing in Texas a few years 
back, when they tried to get rid of 
the Dallas Cowboys Cheerlead
ers, because they were Throwbacks to the 1950s in their bunny 
boots and mini-vests that are cut 
just right so you can see from here 
almost to Cleveland. And Suzanne 
Mitchell, the head of the Dallas 
Cowboys Cheerleaders, came up 
with the perfect solution: the 
Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders 
Written Test. Every year, before 
you can qualify for the squad, you 
have to answer a series of mul
tiple-choice questions about your 
knowledge of football, like What 
is pigskin? Answer: What you 
look like after a night spent with 
a Cowboys offensive lineman. 
Anyhow, I suggest the Warrior 
Gals adopt the same idea, so that 
when these weirdbeards from 
across the water start screaming 
again about how theyre just a 
bunch of airhead bimbos in or
ange Danskins, they can zap em 
right back with the written test. 
Sample question:
In 1988, the Warriors traded 
their entire team to Houston, plus 
three billion dollars, in order to 
get Ralph Sampson. Which of the 
following basketball strategies 
were the Warriors following:
a) The build-for-the-future 
philosophy.
b) The Oh-what-the-heck-weand Live Skull equally, but some
one has to go first. So, Bitch 
Magnet will be opening, with 
Naked Raygun and Live Skull 
following in that order. Doors will 
open at 8:00, with the show get
ting under way somewhere 
around 9:00. Since the show is 
funded by the Activities Fee, its 
free to all CMU students. Anyone 
with an I.D. from another college 
pays $3.00; everyone else pays 
$5.00.
Friday, 8 pm, the Skibo Ball
room, absolutely free. There is no 
better deal. Period.

A
dont-have-a-team-thats-worthdiddly-squat-anyhow philosophy.
c) The He-must-be-good-hestall philosophy.
Correct answer, of course, is 
c, proven recently by the Warri
ors long winning streak while 
both Ralph and Manute were 
injured. But if you dont think the 
Warrior Gals could handle that 
one, you could go more along the 
lines of How do you compute body 
I fat after a 30-minute runI and-stretch workout? A 20- 
S minute? A 10-minute?
 You guys in Oakland, I
 want you to get out there to
 the Coliseum and yell your
 guts out every time those 
li * girls come on the floor. I
MEAN this. Lets show the 
whiners where they can stick it.
Speaking of flesh in a leotard, 
they finally brought out the se
quel to Stripped to Kill, about this 
little stripper who goes home af
ter work every night and has weird 
dreams about zombie voodoo top
less acts and then when she wakes 
up the next morning, she has blood 
all over her mouth and hands and 
the bimbo she dreamed about is 
no longer in need of a G-string, if 
you know what I mean and Im 
sure you do. But, of course, she 
cant be doing the murders, cause 
if she was  no movie. Thats too 
easy. So you spend the whole 
movie wondering whos doing the 
murders  one of the other strip
pers, or else the little weenie an
nouncer guy, a cop, or a weirdo 
customerand in the meantime 
theres a whole bunch of pros with 
names like Dazzle, Mantra, Sonny 
and Something Else flinging their
bods around a giant pole on the 
stage. The subtitle on this movie 
is Live Girls, which reminds me 
of this club thats right by the El 
Lay airport where all they have 
on their sign is Live Girls, like 
they used to have DEAD girls 
that took off their clothes but now 
theyve upgraded the place.
Anyway, good flick, even though 
its no Stripped to Kill Part One. 
Twenty-two breasts. Seven dead 
bodies. Zombie strippers. Razorblade throat-slashing. Aardvarking in an alley. Gratuitous baby 
crocodile. Kung Fu. Pizza Fu. 
Acid-librium-and-pentothal Viet
nam prisoner-of-war potion Fu. 
Drive-In Academy Award nominations for Maria Ford, as the 
Stripper Numero Uno, who thinks 
shes going crazy every night, 
sleep-stripping down to the club, 
and cutting the throats of all her 
friends; Karen Mayo Chandler, 
as the S&M dancer and room
mate of the star for saying, Im 
sorry! I slipped you something in 
your drink, but I only meant to 
knock you out!; Eb Lottimer, as 
Decker the quirky cop, for saying 
Do you know a persons aura is 
visible through fire? Well, its not; 
Debra Lamb, for her black magic 
topless routine; Virginia Peters, 
as the deadpan police librarian, 
for delivering every one of her 
lines in exactly the same bored 
tone, including Rejoice. Com
puters on line.; and Katt Shea 
Ruben, the writer/director, one of 
the most stylish directors work
ing for Roger Corman, king of the 
drive-in.

Lots to cover, so lets jump right 
in...
Whatever you were planning 
on doing this Friday, forget it. Go 
to Winterblast, in the Skibo Ball
room, instead. Naked Raygun and 
Live Skull are two of the 
absolute best groups in exis
tence (Bitch Magnet is no 
slouch either), and theyre 
all going to be playing on 
campus starting at 9:00 
Friday night. And its FREE. 
(Actually, its not free - its 
funded by your Student Activi
ties fee. Since youve already paid 
for it, you might as well go see 
what its like.) This is not like 
seeing some stupid band from 
Annapolis - this is like seeing U2 
(about five years ago, before their 
egos blew up and destroyed their 
minds). There is no better deal. 
Period.
But, if you prefer your music in 
a more sedate (and expensive) 
vein, you might want to check out 
the Chieftains, who will be play
ing at the Fulton Theatre this 
Saturday. The Chieftains are 
probably the most popular Irish 
folk group in the world, having 
played to millions, with 1,350,000 
of those millions included in one 
performance when they played at 
Phoenix Park in Dublin.
Government Issue must be feel
ing the pinch. Their latest LP, 
Crash, is the most accessible
(read: least hardcore) slab theyve 
done yet. The result of such an 
innovative move? Most radio sta
tions still think its too harsh for 
their listeners tender sensibili
ties; most punks think its too 
wimpy for moshing. The end re
sult: nobodys buying it, not even 
the rabid hordes in G.I.s homeMusic rMusi rMusi 
cn 
Revskw
town of Washington, D.C. Now 
the bands talking about break
ing up because theyre tired of the 
grind. All this because theyve 
put out one of the best rock and 
roll (not hardcore, maybe punk) 
albums of the year. Go figure.
As long as were on the subject 
of records, the D.C.-based Dischord Records has just released a 
whole stack of prime wax that you 
should be looking for. Included is 
the new Fugazi EP, Ian 
MacKayes latest band. Hes got
ten over the embarrassment of 
Embrace, regained the energy of 
Minor Threat, and discovered the 
joy of feedback a la Volcano Suns, 
all of which combines into a double 
punch of power and maturity that 
you need to pick up. While youre 
at it, grab a copy of Ignitions new 
Machination LP. Its their first 
full slab, and it rocks even harder 
than Fugazi - Lucky 13 has the
drive and control of a monsoon, 
and is worth the six bucks in it
self.
The Here tics just released their 
first LP (on Get Hip, natch), and 
it doesnt suck nearly as badly as 
I expected it to after seeing them 
live. In fact, the albums pretty 
damn good, and Im really tempted 
to go see them tonight at the 
Metropol, where theyll be 
opening up for labelmates the 
Cynics. The Cynics have been 
quietly making a name for 
themselves elsewhere, and 
this is their first Pittsburgh 
show in quite some time. 
Might be worth checking out, 
although Im still not expecting 
much from the Heretics.
Scott Mervis managed to get in 
a dig at just about every single 
music institution in town in his 
year-end wrapup a few In Pittsburghs ago, leaving just about no 
radio station or club untouched. 
Arent you glad such a perfect 
beingexists for your consultation?
Straight-edge hardcore heroes 
Seven Seconds will be at the 
Graffiti this Thursday, only I 
guess they arent hardcore any
more, so Im not sure whats left. 
Local heroes Half Life will be 
opening, so I guess its a punk 
show. Oboy.
Coming soon: The Kronos Quar
tet; Philip Glass 1000 Airplanes 
on the Roof. Stay tuned.

On a hot summer day in 1957, a 
most remarkable and unlikely 
friendship began on the beach in 
Atlantic City. Eleven year-olds 
C.C. Bloom and Hillary Whitney 
were two kids from completely 
different worlds. C.C. was a brash 
and streetwise New Yorker on 
her way to becoming a famous 
singing star. Hillary was a proper 
young lady from San Francisco on 
vacation with her father and aunt. 
Although the girls go their sepa
rate ways, their one-day encoun
ter was the beginning of a bond 
that would grow stronger over 
the years.
This is the story of the new 
Touchstone movie Beaches, fea
turing Bette Midler and Barbara 
Hershey. Based on the best-sell
ing novel by Iris Rainer Dart (a 
CMU alumna), this movie por
trays the story of a deep friend
ship between two women.
Academy Award nominee Bette 
Midler portrays C.C., a singer who 
grows up and becomes an adult' 
through her relationship with 
Hillary. Midler is a talented singer 
as well as an actress. She has won 
three Grammy Awards and had 
one gold and one platinum al
bum. Over the past few years she 
has also stared in a string of suc
cessful comedies, including Down 
and Out in Beverly Hills, Ruth
less People, Outrageous Fortune, 
and Big Business.
Barbara Hershey, also an Acad
emy Award nominee, stars as 
Hillary, a well-bred and down to 
earth person who really does not 
know who she is. Through the 
birth of her daughter and her 
friendship with C.C., Hillary ulti
mately discovers her identity. 
Last seen in Martin Scorseses 
The Last Temptation of Christ as 
Mary Magdalene, Hershey has 
appeared in several other moving
and complex roles, including 
Diana Roth, a South African 
mother and full-time fighter 
against apartheid in the 
acclaimed A World Apart, Chuck 
Yeagers wife Glennis in The Right 
Stuff, and the obsessive Harriet 
Bird in The Natural.
As the movie progresses, the 
girls friendship grows and devel
ops through the power of letters 
and photographs. The two strik
ingly different women share each
others hopes, dreams, and frus
trations. In the film, C.C. and 
Hillary build a unique tie of loy
alty and friendship which sus
tains them through their mar
riages and careers, triumphs and 
disappointments, and ultimately 
through a crisis that tests their 
love and teaches them the true 
meaning of friendship.
Beaches is currently at the 
Manor in Squirrel Hill. Call for 
playing times.

AN INVITATION TO PARTICIPATE IN FACULTY/STUDENT LUNCHEON SEMINARS ON TEACHING AND LEARNING AT CMU
The University Teaching Center is sponsoring a series of seven Faculty/ 
Student Luncheon Seminars during the Spring, 1989 semester. Topics for 
the seminar have been chosen by members of the Academic Affairs Council 
of the Student Senate and the Educational Affairs and Student Affairs 
Councils of the Faculty Senate. These groups have also suggested students 
and faculty members to lead the seminars.
The seminars will be held on Wednesdays and Thursdays from 12:00 to 1:20
in Rooms 105-106 Skibo. Lunches will served at 12:00 and the seminars will
begin at 12:30. All of the seminars will be interactive, that is, after brief
presentations participants will be invited to express their viewpoints in
What we are confident will be spirited discussions, 
i
jpPe have limited each seminar to a total of 24 participants, twelve students 
jmd twelve faculty members. Since we will have two seminars on each 
topic, we can handle a total of 24 students and 24 faculty members weekly. 
Since we anticipate an enthusiastic response to this invitation, we will 
thoose participants on a first come/first served basis. In addition, we will 
limit participants to one seminar unless others are undersubscribed.
So here's what to do. Look over the attatched list of seminar topics and 
dates. Choose the one(s) you would like to attend and number them in 
order. Then tear out this application and send it via Campus Mail to:

Special to The Tartan
Today, at the Forbes Gallery, a 
show of works by seniors Marta 
Fuentealba and Christine Blair 
will begin. Although both artists 
use the figure as a symbol, their 
specific symbols differ.
Christines drawings use the 
female figure as a symbol for fer
tility. She has travelled through 
Ireland and France which enlight
ened her to prehistoric assem
blages such as New Grange, an 
ancient mound in Ireland. With 
her Irish descent in mind, 
Christine realized that New 
Grange, among other ancient 
artifacts, is very close to her per
sonal life. Mother Earth as a 
symbol of fertility also plays a 
role in Christines work, as does 
Venus, the ancient symbol of fer
tility.
One of Christines mixed media 
drawings depicts three figures, 
situated in a line: a crudely drawn 
Venus figure, the image of 
Christines grandmother with 
traces ofVenus shapein herform, 
and the most realistically drawn 
of the three images, Christines 
mother, in a sweatsuit.
Christine will also show litho
graphs and monoprints which 
focus on the same subject matter.
Marta will show drawings and 
paintings that use the human 
form as acentralimage. Her paint
ings might be described as using 
a Fauvist style, because of their 
bright color. Andre Derain, a 
Fauvist, is one of Martas favor
ites. One painting, somewhere in 
the neighborhood of 4 or 5 feet in 
each dimension,hasabackground 
of potent red-orange. An unre
strained, yet not overpowering, 
use of bright color acting as light
best describes how Marta allows 
herself to experiment while still 
maintaining the level of realism 
that she demands. Inspired by a 
show of Hispanic artists, Marta 
enjoyed their playful use of bright 
color, their whimsical sense of 
humor, and their courage in us
ing flat shapes. All of these as
pects have influenced Martas 
work.
Marta uses familiar figures as 
subject matter in her paintings. 
Last year, most of her work used 
the self-portrait, but this year she 
has decided to depict other famil
iar faces.
Marta will also show charcoal 
and pastel drawings. Again, these 
works are rich in color, yet the 
subject matter is not overwhelm
ing.
Christine and Marta will have 
a closing reception this Friday, 
January 27, from 7-9 pm.

Thursday, January 26 The Unbearable Lightness of Being
This film tells the story of a young surgeon who 
attempts to float above the boring world of responsi
bility and commitment, to practice a sex life that has 
no bearing on the heart, to escape untouched from the 
world of sensual pleasure while retaining his privacy 
and his loneliness. A long and intricate film that fully 
explores loss, idealism, nostalgia, and romance. Based 
on the novel by the Czech novelist Milan Kundera.

Friday, January 27 Who Framed Roger Rabbit
What can be said about the highest grossing 
movie of 1988 ($150 million) that has not been said 
already? Roger Rabbit has been framed with a mur
der and hires a private detective to get him out of this 
mess. An extremely funny movie with the state-ofthe-art animation that has set the standard for ani
mated films for years to come. If you have not seen it, 
see it. If you have seen it, see it again.

Saturday, January 28 Die Hard
Another mega hit of 1988 that has to be seen to be 
believed. This movie is one of the most relentlessly 
nonstop action pictures ever made, with a virtuoso 
series of climactic sequences that lasts about an hour 
and never stops for a second. Bruce Willis is a NYC 
cop caught in a building taken over by twelve terror
ists and has only one chance to save the hostages  
not to mention himself. Even if you hate Bruce Willis, 
see this movie. Personal feelings shouldnt get in the 
way of spectacular movie fun.

Sunday, January 29 Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs
Another Disney classic that will surely bring a 
tear to your eye. Now before you start saying some
thing negative about this movie, think real hard  
when was the last time you saw it? Can you honesty 
criticize a movie that you saw a decade ago? Now, 
there are three proper ways of watching this movie. 
First, See it again just to relive the magic, wonder, 
and beauty of this immortal classic. Second, bring 
your girlfriend along with you and share the magic 
and warmth before and after this heart-warming 
movie with someone you love. Third and finally, my 
favorite way, get completely trashed beforehand and 
watch this movie with a completely new sense of 
understanding. (Editors Note: The Tartan does notin 
any way condone the use of alcohol or illicit sub

 Ed. note
By YZW DORMAMMU
Tartan Investigative Team
After my decision to attend 
Carnegie Mellon, I was pre
sented with the difficult proc
ess of dorm selection.
My decision to live in the new 
dorm was based on the adminstrations description, which 
left me with a vision of nothing 
s than the Ritz or the Taj 
Mahal.
Imagine my surprise when I 
arrived to find that I would be 
living at the University Inn for 
the foreseeable future. After a 
semester, I decided that hotel 
living wasnt any better than 
living on a construction site. I 
Packed my bags and set off for 
mY new home.
The cab dropped me off next 
to Tech House. A chain link 
fence separated me from my 
Promised residence. Contem
plating the fence, I made my
way down a short hill, over the 
packed mud and jagged ground, 
around loosely tied bundles of 
construction materials and 
scattered bricks, and at last to 
the East Wing.
After a cursory search, I found 
a ladder leading down into what 
I presumed was the basement. 
I had to push aside a propped 
board, forcing my way into the 
structure.
Once inside, I marveled at 
the size of it all. It seemed much 
larger once inside. Setting down 
my bags in what would one day 
be the new cafeteria, I went off 
to survey the establishment.
The new dorm was typical of 
most construction sites. The 
floors were thickly tracked with 
mud and had an uneven qual
ity to them.
Hanging from the ceilings 
were bare light bulbs which, 
thanks to the kindness of the 
administration, were left on all 
night, making my exploration 
much easier.
The air was thick with dust, 
and in the place of stairs were 
ladders made of two-byfours, which stretched up to the 
various levels of the building.
Windows had not yet been in
stalled, and in their place were 
plastic coverings which were 
blown about by the wind. The 
first room I came upon had no 
floor. Hundreds of steel bars 
protruded from the ground, 
waiting for cement to be poured 
over them.
Obviously, heavy construction 
was still very much underway. 
To confirm my belief were the 
numerous signs warning me to 
wear a hard hat.
I straightened my baseball 
cap and moved on. From here I 
moved west down a short ce
ment corridor and into a larger 
room which contained innu
merable cinderblocks and as
sorted heavy machinery. I was 
drawn to the fork lift, which 
held the promise of many hours 
of entertainment.
After several attempts to start 
the engine, I gave up; my best 
efforts had failed. The construc
tion crew had removed parts of 
the engine in a deliberate at
tempt to annoy me, and it 
worked.
I then examined the piles of 
cinderblocks which I initially 
thought would make good fur
niture, but proved too unstable 
for even the simplest chair or
fold-out bed.
In the south-eastern end was 
a small crane-like device which 
briefly served as a make-shift 
swing. I tired of this quickly 
and proceeded.
I came to a small cubicle which 
I assumed would be typical of a 
student single. Being thirsty I 
broke out a Rolling Rock, pre
sumably the first such housing 
policy violation in the new 
dorm. I enjoyed my brief mo
ment of glory.
What next? As if in answer to 
my question, I found a semi
portable welding torch. I 
burned my initials into the wall, 
but soon after the torch gave 
out and I was forced to find yet 
other amusements.
At this point I started to no
tice the cold and was elated to 
discover that the industrial 
strength heater in the adjoin
ing room was in working order. 
12,000 watts of AWESOME 
POWER! Well, maybe not, but 
at least it worked.
My problems with the cold 
solved, I wandered on to what 
seemed to be a supply room.
There I discovered a set of 
building plans which helped me 
to orient myself. I also was
tempted to borrow some of 
the myriad of construction 
supplies until I realized they 
would be of no use to me.
I left the room and passed 
through a corridor with no 
roof. I traveled on to the West 
Wing, which closely re
sembled everything else. I 
reached its end and climbed 
one of the many ladders. At 
the top I discovered the sec
ond floor, and the beginnings 
of what looked like student 
rooms.
The view here would have 
been excellent had the win
dows been transparent. Nev
ertheless, I decided, for lack 
of a third floor, this was the 
most desirable place to stay.
As written in the Under
graduate Catalog, Univer
sity students vary in their 
preferences for types of ac
commodations.
In this case, my preferences 
would have included a bed, 
plumbing, walls, and other 
such 1 incuries. After much con
sideration, I decided that 
perhaps the University Inn 
could be tolerated until con
struction of the new dorm was 
completed.

2,
Javi contemplates his favorite conspiracies
The holidays are over, and not a 
oment too soon. All that we have 
do is make it past Valentines 
pay, and all will be safe for us 
i. Valentines Day is perhaps 
'the most insidious of all holidays.
gives every person who has 
ever stomped upon my heart with 
cjeats the opportunity to rub my 
fyce into the mud of rejection by 
jBnding me one of those annoying 
(friendship Valentines.
At times I wonder what sort of 
process compels the powerstjiat-be to create things like 
friendship Valentines. I often 
link that everything that goes 
in the holidays is part of some 
einous conspiracy to offend the 
sensibilities of cynical-people^ith-a-heart-of-gold, such as 
iiyself.
Yes, its a sick, sick world we 
live in, and the machinations of 
the powerful and manipulative 
permeate everything we think or 
say or do, which brings me to my 
typic for today.
My Favorite Conspiracy 
Theories:
1. The Truth About Swedish' 
Rock Groups: I am convinced that 
there has really only been one 
Swedish rock group in existence. 
During the seventies we knew 
them as ABBA, but once their 
fame wore thin they retreated into 
top secret conversion facility 
sponsored by the super top-secret 
organization, the Swedish Per
forming Artists Militia (S.P.A.M.). 
In this facility the members of 
ABBA went through extremely 
painful mind and body altering 
operations that lasted about two 
years.
Soon it was time for them to 
emerge into the world as the pop 
group a-Ha. Surely enough, the 
a-Ha bandwagon soon outlived 
its welcome and it was time again 
for these Scandinavian Sopranos 
to subject themselves to another 
years worth of extremely painful 
operations. Afterwards, these 
syncopated Swedes were pre
sented to the world as the GlamRock band Europe.
Sounds too strange to be true? 
Have you noticed that in all three 
time periods there has only been 
one Swedish rock group on the 
charts? Or, the fact that they all 
sing in the higher ranges of the 
human voice? Or the fact that in 
all three cases it is usually impos
sible to tell which members of the 
group are men and which are 
women?
Apparently this technique is 
starting to spread. Earlier this 
year Iceland also tried, but due to 
their considerably less sophisti
cated technology, their efforts to 
produce a band which would give 
Blondie a run for their money 
yielded The Sugarcubes instead.
2. Zombies are Real and They 
Walk Among the Living: This one 
is really frightening. Sources in
form me that the combined forces 
of the Y.M.C.A. (which, in case
you are wondering, does not re
ally stand for Young Mens Chris
tian Association, but for Yank 
Morticians and Chase them 
Away), the F.B.I. (which actu
ally stands for the Funerary 
Blackballers Internship), and the 
U.S.F.L. (Undertakers Should 
Flee the Living) have discovered 
the ancient voodoo secret of zombiefication.
They have been administering 
it to several famous people in order 
to create a high profile showcase 
for their discovery, in an attempt 
to thwart the funeral trade.
Recipients of this highly potent 
drug include: Keith Richards, 
Robert Mitchum, Stephen King, 
Dean Martin, the entire first 
string of the Detroit Lions, and 
my last girlfriend.
3. Elvis, Janis Joplin, Josef 
Mengele, John Lennon, James 
Dean, Jim Morrison, Jimi Hen
drix, Natalie Wood, John Belushi, 
Adolf Hitler, Keith Moon, Rudolf 
Hess, John Bonham: All died a 
long time ago, have been dead for 
nearly as long, and plan on re
maining dead for as long as they 
can help it.
4. Phil Collins and Charlie 
Brown are Really the Same Per
son: Consider the startling facts; 
both Phil Collins and Charlie 
Brown have perfectly round 
heads. They both have only one 
hair. Phil Collins and Charlie 
Brown have never been seen in 
the same room together. Phil 
Collins sings about grief, Char
lie Browns favorite expression 
is Good Grief. Peanuts and 
Genesis are both seven letter 
words.
Phil Collins sings In The Air 
Tonight, Lucy puts Charlie 
Brown in the air every day. Phil 
Collins third solo album was en
titled No Jacket Required, 
Charlie Brown has never worn a 
jacket. Diabolical, simply diaboli
cal.
5. Talk-show Co-Hosts: Are ac
tually the highly trained mem
bers of R.E.G.I.S., the Registry of 
Energetic but Gratuitously In
nocuous Showmen. Trained since 
birth to operate highly sophisti
cated ventriloquist dummies be
fore a live audience, these men 
actually control what you see on 
the screen.
a 7egrhgglg cay:?gBtM Bta'
At a party recently, I met a 
erky young woman who had a 
lischievous laugh and a wild 
;ory to tell.
Last spring, she said, she went 
national TV to declare that she 
nd her husband had figured a 
ever way to deal with their sexal problems.
On Sally Jessy Raphaels talk 
low, she confessed that her 
usband got his sexual gratificaon from another woman  a
rofessional sex surrogate. Her 
usband also appeared on the 
low, as did the smiling surroate. To viewers, they seemed to 
)je the happiest TV threesome 
jnce My Three Sons.
Needless to say, their act made 
$r compelling TV. But, as youve 
robably heard by now, this 
voman, her alleged husband 
ind the sex surrogate were all 
mposters  actors. Two of them 
ad pulled similar stunts on The 
|prah Winfrey Show and Ger|do.
They thought it would be fun to 
jnbarrass the talk-show indus*y. They also wanted to test their 
cting abilities: Two of them had 
sumes highlighted by dinner 
leater performances in Omaha, 
' Its a big step from Man of
La Mancha to Women Who Hate 
Sex (the title of the Winfrey show 
on which they appeared).
Anyway, at the party I attended, 
those gathered around this ac
tress were transfixed as she re
counted her adventure: how her 
co-conspirators plotted the hoax; 
how a Chicago psychologist with 
questionable ethics helped them 
get on the shows; how folks in 
Nebraska recognized the dinnertheater performance and turned 
them in.
At the party, this actress was 
the center of attention, just as she 
had been on TV. She showed no 
remorse, nor did the rest of us 
voice objections.
But think about it: What these 
actors did was reprehensible. Its 
no excuse for them to say that 
because talk shows these days 
deal in too much sensationalism, 
their impersonations were some 
sort of expose.
What they actually did was 
undermine the credibility and 
integrity of all talk shows  in
deed, all media outlets  includ
ing those dealing with legitimate 
subjects that deserve attention. 
These actors may say their per
formance was just a game, a bit of 
free-lance improvisation. All the 
world isnt a stage, and being an 
actor doesnt give you license to 
lie.
The joke wasnt on the talkshow hosts. In essence, they in
sulted everyone who tuned in. By 
hoodwinking Oprah, Sally, and 
Geraldo, they hoodwinked us all.
This sordid episode hits home 
with me because I write a column 
that depends on the honesty and 
integrity of readers. In my 16
months in this job, Ive found that 
98 percent of the mail I receive is 
absolutely on level. How can I be 
sure? Well, I hear from people 
whose emotionswhether panic, 
fear or joy  are evident in every 
line they write. They share their 
lives, their secrets, their most 
intimate truths.
I hear from many other who 
have opinions about issues in the 
column. They tend to be so com
mitted to their beliefs that I 
neednt question their sincerity. 
If you looked through a stack of 
my mail, youd see just what Im 
talking about.
Sure, Ive received some fake 
questions, usually on the phonein hot line. (Most are a cinch to 
spot: Im a Siamese twin. I like

Recently, a contact of mine, 
who happened to work as a re
ceptionist for R.E.G.I.S.s rival 
organization, M.E.R.V. (Machi
avellian Entertainers for the 
Removal of Ventriloquists), 
before his untimely death had 
supplied me with a list of mem
bers ofR.E.G.I.S. which includes 
Ed McMahon, Vanna White, 
Larry Bud Melman (who has 
the staggeringly complex task 
of operating two dummies at 
once), and of course, Topo Gigio.
6. The Sudden Rise in the 
popularity of Heavy Metal Mu
sic: Has just been revealed to 
me by a contact in the State De
partment, shortly before his un
fortunate murder, as the result 
of the efforts of a mystery or
ganization which goes by the 
name of American Emissaries 
of Republican Organizations 
Seeking Mass Indoctrination 
Toward Homogeneity.
7. The Vaticans Strategic De
fense Initiative: Have you ever 
wondered how the Vatican 
would defend itself if one of its 
many belligerent neighbors ever 
chose to launch a full scale at
tack upon them? One of my 
contacts in the Catholic church 
recently supplied me with the 
secret before he was excommu
nicated under mysterious cir
cumstances.
Apparently the Papal Miter is 
in fact a nose cone under which 
is a complex system of M.I.R.V. 
(Missile Inquisitors Rebuff Vic
tims) warheads. Whenever the 
Vatican perceives the threat of a 
nuclear first strike, all they have to 
do is launch the Pope into a geosta
tionary orbit over the offending 
country.
From what I gather, the Popes 
guidance system is virtually infal
lible.
Of course, I have not even begun 
to address the many covert activi
ties which have taken over our 
country like some freak blight. I 
often stay up nights wondering why 
it is that viewer supported public 
television features a show such as 
NOVA, which is an obvious ana
gram of AVON. Or, is the disapearance of the BooBerry and 
Ghostbusters cereals a plot to 
undermine the buying power of the 
living dead.
Or, is it merely a result of the 
location of the Kelloggs headquar
ters in Battle Creek, Michigan 
(which happens to be in exactly the 
same hemisphere as the Bermuda 
Triangle). And, is cucumber just 
a garden vegetable or an acronym 
for the Central United Coven Un
ion of the Malodorous Bored Evil
doers Room?

I cant say that phony questions 
havent made it into this column. 
People dont always sign their 
names.
Creative writers can dr&ft 
compelling fiction. Ive probably 
been had more than once. But if 
Im suspicious, I try to verify a 
letter, or stay clear of it. Thats all 
I can do.
Basically, trust is essential in 
our society. When we come to a 
stop sign on a deserted street, 
were expected to stop. When we 
testify in court, we promise to tell 
the truth. So, too, should we con
duct our lives honestly when 
dealing with the media.

molrg vedlg a7derlSti cBl ClM laiQ Uac eg enParty held 
after hoops 
game
By CARLOS FRANCO
Tartan Features Co-Editor
) With the womens gym lit by 
AB Techs multi-colored lighting 
and D J Bernard Uys music blast
ing through the air, the stage was 
set for a great party.
The party took place on Thurs
day night after the basketball 
game. Organizers Special Assis
tant to the Vice President of 
Enrollment Rob Bowie and En
thusiasm Co-Chair Erica Levy 
hoped that fans would migrate 
l from the mens gym to the party 
after the game. The organizers of 
the event hoped that a party held 
on the first Thursday of the se
mester would be a success since it 
i would give students a chance to 
get together in a social atmos
phere during the first week back.
However, despite postering, a 
banner placed in front of Doherty 
Hall advertising the party, and 
halftime promotion by the ScotI tie Dog, not many people at
tended.
A flow of about 65 people at
tended the party, but few danced. 
Most of the people just hung 
around and talked. Commenting 
on the turnout, Levy stated I 
think that the people who were 
there had a good time.
According to Bowie, the event 
was held to link school spirit to 
basketball. He explained that he 
is trying to get students more 
' involved in the Universitys ath
letic programs  starting with 
; football and basketball, and then 
moving to other sports.
Bowie felt the turnout at the 
basketball game was pretty good 
and attributes lack of turn out at 
the party to a number of factors 
 DTD and ATO parties, people 
going to Panther Hollow Inn, and 
the fact that no alcohol was served 
at the basketball game party.
The party cost little to put to
gether. Several campus organi
zations volunteered considerable 
time.
Levy explained that the party 
! required last minute coordina
tion on her part. For example, 
she had to contact the Scottie 
\ Dog to hand out party fliers and 
throw miniature basketballs to 
s the crowd.
Bowie explained that the money 
for the party came from the fresh
man class. They gave the $500 
which they won in the contest to 
transport the game ball to the 
[.football stadium. The money went 
towards paying AB Tech $125 for 
setting up the lighting, $138 to 
Campus Security, and $100 for 
the DJ, Uy.
Bowie asked SDC to put to
gether the banner that appeared 
ififront of Doherty Hall early last 
week. He also asked Spirit to 
poster the campus for the event. 
APhiO, which usually sells re
freshments after the basketball 
games, moved their equipment to 
the womens gym to sell refresh
ments for the party.
The miniature basketballs were 
donated by the CMU Bookstore.
In explaining the apparent in
crease in attendance at athletic 
events, Bowie states The stu
dent body is changing. There are 
more well rounded students  
they like sports.
Bowie stated that he is always 
looking for things people want to 
do. Upcoming events include a 
trip raffle on February 1.

Dear Specs:
There are no hot babes at 
Carnegie Mellon. All the cute 
chicks have boyfriends, and all 
the others are total whales.
Any ideas for a dude looking 
to hook up?
Disgusted
Dear Disgusted:
1989 is a year that has 
brought us an entirely new set 
ofideals. With the Bush family 
in the White House, a tone of 
understatement and down 
home has been set for the 
community.
Girls no longer have to emu
late the Californian Cambodia 
look. No more suffering with 
nouvelle 2-endive-leaves cui
sine for dinner. Eating is in. 
Being big and cozy no longer 
applies only to the Morewood 
Reading Room. It pertains to 
the first lady, as well as some of
our finer females on campus.
There are male role models who 
boast of a sturdier physique, too. 
6 feet tall and 230 pounds, the 
Cincinnati Bengals spunky Ickey 
Woods is getting quite a lot of 
attention. Bubba Paris of the San 
Fransisco 49ers cant be over
looked; hes a 302 pound bundle 
of joy.
If you have any doubts re
garding how chic it is for girls 
to eat like the Chicago Bears 
William the Refrigerator 
Perry Just count the number of 
doughnuts and danishes that 
are consumed by women every 
day at the Kiltie.
Stop complaining and join the 
pack. Eat more. If you have to 
quit smoking to do it, go ahead. 
We already have a thousand 
points of light in Washington, who 
needs another thousand in Pitts
burgh?
Specs
Dear Specs:
I have a problem. Its hard for 
me to think of things to say in 
conversations. Im tongue tied 
totally  but, it gets really bad 
when I meet someone for the first
time. Especially if hes cute.
What should I do? The uncom
fortable silences are getting 
longer.
-Help?!
Dear Help:
Relax. Certain topics of conver
sation are in, and others are out.
You should really only worry 
about what to say that is chic. 
Everything else can be left un
broached.
Do discuss the pleasures of the 
Tartan Grills new walk-through 
service. Remark upon how nice it 
is that the U. S. is on speaking 
terms with the Palestine Lib
eration Organization, and 
whether or not Libya will still 
exist next year.
Comment on the similari
ties between this semesters 
fraternity parties and Times 
Square on New Years Eve. 
Do we need another Bernie 
Goetz to enable us to get to the 
bar in under an hour?
Ask your friends to guess the 
difference in ages between your 
grandfather and San Francisco 
49ers Joe Montana. And, while 
youre on the topic of sports, ask if 
theyd buy a case ofbaseball cards 
just for the gum. Any one of those
subjects is fine.
But, remember, do not utter 
a syllable involving topics of 
conversation that are now 
passe. DONT BRING UP: 
Madonna and Sean, Robin and 
Mike Tyson, or the Supreme 
Court and abortion. Certain 
classic combinations are also 
unmentionable: cancer and 
Emperor Hirohito; student 
parking and CMU; and shan
ties, money orders for Grateful 
Dead tickets under $300, and 
saying no to drugs are all abso
lutely boring and dated.
Finally, there are two things 
that Must Never Be Said. The 
first is anything to do with as
trology. The subject is so out, 
that even hearing the old 
Whats your sign" line calls for 
retribution. And lastly, never 
say No, no I insist. You paid 
last time.

After year lone search...Harvey named new AD
Pull Baby, Pull
Since there was no snow in 
Georgia this year, I had a tough 
time dealing with Winter 
Break. I was watching TV one 
afternoon, and while I was flip
ping through the channels, I 
found a way out of my boredom.
Power, POWER, POWER-ERER-ER!!! The announcers voice 
roared out of my Trinitron. The 
1989 Tractor Pulling series was 
coming to the Omni in Atlanta.
I had to go. Id heard a lot 
about the pulls" but had never 
actually seen one. I had been 
living in the south for darn near 
10 years and it was high time I 
partook in one of the basic 
rituals of the region.
It was six oclock and the 
event started at eight. I called 
my friend Peter and told him to 
meet me at the Omni parking 
lot in 45 minutes. Peter claims 
that he is not a redneck. How
ever, he doesnt need a program 
whenever he goes to a NASCAR 
race and that, by God, is the 
true test of a redneck.
When we got there, the first 
thing I noticed was the smell. 
The vents in the ceiling were 
opened, but the smell of dozens 
of mammoth motors running 
was shocking, considering I was 
used to the stench of stale beer 
and hot dogs at basketball 
games. As for the people, these 
werent the rough and rowdy 
good ole boys seen on The 
Dukes ofHazzard. They were 
just regular guys with their 
dates or families to have a good 
time and see the ultimate in 
motorized power.
The sport is a simple one. 
These enormous, elaborate 
tractors and trucks are hitched 
up to a mammoth sled, and the 
driver tries to drag the sled as 
far as his vehicle is able. The 
catch is that a huge weight 
slides up the sled as the tractor 
pulls. For each foot the tractor 
pulls, the sleds weight in
creases by one ton. This is what 
I just paid ten bucks to see.
The machines themselves are 
truly impressive. You have your 
' dragster tractors, your funny 
cars, and your pick-up trucks. 
The tractors are the biggest.
The rear wheels are about 10 
feet or more in diameter, and 
they are what do all of the 
pulling. Each tractor also has 
two to three engines, all of 
which are employed at full 
power the moment the tractor 
blasts off the start line.
As the machine gets bogged 
down near the end of the run, 
the huge wheels kick up hun
dreds of pounds of dirt and 
mud. One tractor, equipped 
with a jet engine, started to 
flame out when the sled got to 
be too much. You can literally 
feel the power of these ma
chines as they fight for every 
inch along the track.
Aside from their power, these 
were very decorative machines. 
Beautiful paint jobs, and deco
rative accessories make these 
vehicles coveted pieces of art. 
Some people come simply to get 
ideas on how to make their own 
pick ups a bit more attractive.
The crowd is very supportive, 
yelling things like, Pull Baby, 
PULL! They seem to yell more 
at the machines than at the 
men inside these beasts.
We had a ball. I learned more 
about physics and mechanical 
engineering in those two hours 
than I ever could in a classroom 
back at school, not to mention 
whats best to get a chewing to
bacco juice stain out of my 
- jeans.

Tartan Assistant Sports Editor
The search is now over for a 
new Director of Athletics at Car
negie Mellon. On January 6, 
William Elliot, vice president for 
enrollment announced the ap
pointment of Dr. John H. Harvey 
as the Director of Athletics, De
partment of Athletics and Physi
cal Education. Harvey replaces 
Jim Banner who retired last 
March. Harvey will start his posi
tion on March 1.
Harvey comes to Carnegie 
Mellon from St. Marys College of 
Maryland where he was the Di
rector of Athletics, the Depart
ment Head of Physical Fitness 
and Recreational Sports, and 
Associate Professor of Human 
Development. Prior to hisappointment at St. Marys, Harvey held 
various athletic related positions 
at Grinnell (Iowa) College (1980-
1983) and at Harvard University 
(1970-1980).
The top choice by administra
tive and student search commit
tees, Harvey has made a firm 
commitment to Division III ath
letics and to the role that an aca
demically oriented school like 
Carnegie Mellon plays in the 
division. In a letter to CMU he 
wrote, I believe we are entering a 
period when Division Ills special 
approach to athletics can be of 
greater advantage to each of our 
institutions future than ever 
before, and can put us in a leader
ship role in the publics percep
tion of what college sports pro
grams can and should be. Carne
gie Mellon could be at the fore
front in our divisions thinking, 
just as the Ivy League universi
ties enjoy a unique role on the 
Division I scene.
According to Elliot, acting di
rector of athletics, the goal of Dr.
Harvey and the Department of 
Athletics and Physical Education 
is to offer the same excellence in 
athletics and recreation as is evi

Four Carnegie Mellon swim
mers made a strong showing 
at the All-Ohio Invitational last 
Saturday. Held at Ohio Uni
versity, schools from all over 
Ohio in Divisions I and III, 
competed in this NCAA spon
sored event. Freshman Jo 
Wollschlaeger set new school 
records with her times in the 
breast stroke and butterfly.
Carnegie Mellon, the only 
team not from Ohio, was not
able to bring an entire team to the 
meet. The rest of the team was 
competing against Hiram at 
CMU. However, they proved to 
be strong competition. Against 
swimmers of Division I, three 
Tartans placed. Wollschlaeger 
placed sixth in the 200 butterfly 
with a time of 2:11.82 and sev
enth in the 200 breast with a time 
of 2:32.6. Teammates senior Greg 
Schooley and freshman Brian 
Zimmerman also placed. Schooley 
competed in the consolation fi
nals (places 9-16), and Zimmer
man made the finals in both the
200 and the 500 freestyle. 
Fourth team member junior 
Pat Hensler despite a good 
effort, did not place.
Wollschlaeger was excited 
about the Invitational saying 
that it was very fast and very 
intense. It was the fastest 
competition weve had all year. 
Shes very confident about 
the remainder of the season. 
We will probably win the PAC 
(Presidents Athletic Confer
ence) this year, said 
Wollschlaeger.Theres not 
much competition.

Before Saturday night, the last 
time the Lady Tartans lost a game, 
it was January 3. They were play
ing against St. Vincents College 
two days after returning from 
Winter Break. Since that time, 
the Carnegie Mellon womens bas
ketball team have picked up two 
University Athletic Association 
(UAA) and four Presidents Ath
letic Conference (PAC) victories 
to raise their overall record to 11- 
4 (5-2 UAA, 4-0 PAC).
The Lady Tartans travelled to 
Chicago to take on the Lady 
Maroons of the University of 
Chicago (10-5, 5-1 UAA). In the 
first ten minutes of play, CMU 
quickly found itself down by five. 
From that point on, the game 
bacame a seesaw battle, with
neither team being able to get 
ahead by more than five points. 
At halftime, the score stoodknotted at 24-24.
The second half saw much of 
the same type of play. With ten 
seconds left in the game, and 
Chicago leading by one point, the 
Lady Tartans inbounded the ball 
to forward Aimee Reber, who tried 
a turnaround hook shot. Her shot 
was blocked, so she passed the 
ball out to the guard, Lisa Lightner. Lightner, not having an open 
shot, passed the ball to freshman 
guard Leigh Anne Palovich, who 
could not get her shot off before 
the clock expired. Chicago won 
57-56.
Palovich, named WRCT Player 
of the Game, led the Lady Tar
tans with 15 points, four steals 
and three assists. Lightner had 
14 points and junior Lisa Smith
added nine points, five rebounds 
and three steals.
Defensively, Lightner shad
owed the Lady Maroons AllAmerican sophomore guard Kris
ten Maschka thoughoutthe game. 
She was held to only eight points, 
spending much of the second half 
on the bench with four personal 
fouls.
Carnegie has been on a tear 
through both the UAA and the 
PAC, defeating Rochester (65-47), 
John Hopkins (82-60), Bethany 
(71-50), John Carroll (73-61), and 
Hiram (71-58) over break, and 
Grove City (70-56) during the first 
week of classes this semester. 
According to Head Coach Gerri 
Seidl, playing basketball without 
the pressure of going to classes 
and the depth of her bench were 
big factors in the teams winning 
streak.

The Tartan mens and womens 
swimming teams both took two 
weeks off from their winter vaca
tions to make their annual so
journ to the International Swim
ming Hall of Fame pool in sunny 
Fort Lauderdale, Florida. While 
the location may have been pleas
ant, there was no scarcity of work 
for the Tartan swimmers.
Each of the two daily workouts 
consisted of a 6000 yard swim 
(approximately 3.5 miles) lasting 
an hour and forty-five minutes. 
The workouts consisted of a vari
ety of kicking and technique drills 
as well as individual stroke exer
cises specific to getting the team 
in shape for the rest of the season.
The students who went to Flor
ida with us trained very hard and 
are in great shape, explained 
Coach Jim Perkins. One of the 
most important things we do all 
year long is to go to Fort Lauder
dale to train for those two weeks, 
he added.
The team returned to Carnegie 
Mellon on January 14 to reorgan
ize and prepare for a dual meet 
against Washington & Jefferson 
on January 16. The Tartan team, 
although slightly tired, defeated 
W&J with the mens and womens 
teams winning solidly, 121-86 and 
106-59, respectively.
Coach Perkins was pleased with 
the results. Generally, everyone 
swam well even though were
really tired from all the yardage 
weve been doing, he said. Its 
fortunate that school has started 
so that were only doing one work
out a day. We have some forced 
rest ahead, and the team is enjoy
ing it.
Against W&J, freshman art 
major Jo Wollschlaeger was the 
only double event winner, win
ning both the 200 yard freestyle 
and the 200 yard backstroke. 
During the meet, senior Anita 
Fisher (200 yard freestyle), sen
ior Terri McCloud (200 yard ind 
vidual medley), freshman Debbie 
Madsen (500 yard freestyle), and 
sophomore Heather Uljon (100 
yard freestyle) all beat their per
sonal best times in their respec
tive events.
The men had no double winners 
or personal bests. However, ac
cording to Coach Perkins, it is 
uncommon after heavy training, 
for the men to break their best 
times. Men have a greater muscle 
mass, and when this greater mass 
of muscles gets tired it is propor
tionally harder to perform well. 
The coach stated, Our men are 
swimming very well. They are 
swimming a lot faster than they 
have in the past several years at 
this time.
On Saturday, the men and 
women picked up another win 
defeating Hiram at home. The 
men defeated Hiram 104-70 while 
the women won 109-80. During 
the meet Debbie Madsen beat the

The Presidents Athletic Con
ference recently fell on hard times 
as Carnegie Mellon announced 
its plans to depart from the con
ference. With the announcement, 
CMU joins John Carroll and 
Hiram on the list teams leaving 
the PAC.
Dr. William Elliot, acting ath
letic director at Carnegie Mellon, 
said that CMU will resign its 
membership in the PAC at the 
conclusion of the 1989-90 season 
and will become a full-time 
member of the University Ath
letic Association.
With membership in the UAA 
as our primary arena of competi
tion and considering the pending 
realignment of the membership 
in the PAC, said Elliot, it ap
pears this would be an appropri
ate opportunity to conclude out 
membership in the PAC.
The PAC is in somewhat of a 
transition period, added CMUs 
Sports Information Director 
Bruce Gerson, so its a good time 
to let them know our intentions.
John Carroll and Hiram will 
withdraw all sports from the 
league at the conclusion of the 
1988-89 season, except for 
Hirams football program, which 
Will remain through 1989.
Our football program remain
ing in the PAC through next sea
son is easier for everyone con
cerned, said Hirams Athletic 
Director Bill Hollinger. It was 
just something we preferred to 
do, and it will be less disruptive to 
both the PAC and our new confer
ence.
Hiram and John Carroll will be 
re-joining the Ohio Athletic Con
ference (OAC). They left the OAC. 
in the seventies to become fulltime members of the PAC, and 
according to Hollinger, it was the 
right move at the time for Hiram.
The PAC was a very good con
ference for us, the kind of confer
ence we enjoyed being associated 
with, said Hollinger, but the 
PAC we are leaving is not the 
PAC we joined. If it were the same, 
wed still be there. But things 
have changed.
Reaction among students, ath
letes and coaches at CMU is 
slightly varied, but most seem to 
feel that breaking away from the 
PAC is the right choice and will 
benefit the teams in the long run.
Part of the problem with mem
bership in the PAC while con
tinuing to play UAA games is 
that the teams are not eligible for 
the UAA championships. PAC ob
ligations require two games 
against each of the six PAC teams, 
leaving insufficient room to sched
ule the requisite number of UAA 
games.
We could be the best team in 
the UAA, said junior Lisa Smith 
of the womens basketball team, 
but were not eligible for the 
championship and the only way 
to become eligible is to leave the 
PAC and schedule more UAA 
games.
The UAA is the most competi
tive conference in Division III 
athletics, said sophomore Dan
Holland, a member of the CrossCountry team. If we go UAA, it 
would certainly improve our. pro
gram, because well be running 
against better competition.
To some, like sophomore' foot
ball player Marvin Germany, 
leaving the PAC will take away 
important aspects of the game, 
despite its benefits.
Well still be playing the same 
teams only they wont be PAC 
rivalries anymore, commented 
Germany. Well be playing teams 
for pride instead of the PAG title, 
and it will be different. Theres 
just more motivation playingW& J 
when the PAC championship is 
on the line.
Womens Cross Country and 
Track Coach Dario Donatelli feels 
that one of the major losses will 
be the PAC championship, which 
his team has won three times, 
and the mens cross country team 
nine.
The move will mean that we 
wont have a PAC championship 
anymore. Thats one quality meet 
well be losing, and its hard to 
find good meets anymore, he said.

Microsoft
Microsoft is the middle of the computer Universe. All the BIG companies do business 
with usI know, Ive dealt with some of them. One project I worked on involved two of 
the largest computer companies bidding against each other for a contract with one of the 
largest retailers in the worldboth bids used our software. My first project required that I 
travel to Paris to install itonly 3 months out of school. From day one I was in charge of 
my own work (which happened to be the corporate E-mail network).
My four years here have been spent with top-notch technical people, who are also my 
friends. Our group is almost like a family. This holds true for the entire company.
Seattle and the Microsoft environment is like nowhere else. We can leave work at 5:00 pm 
and still get in an evening of skiing. There are 5,000 foot mountains within an hours drive. 
White water is only 30 minutes awaythe lakes are even closer. The parking lot is always 
full of cars with bikes, kayaks, canoes, or skis on top. I know people who keep juggling 
clubs or unicycles in their offices. I keep three frisbees in my office (one is soft for indoor 
use).
 Neat Friedman, Design Engineer 
CMU, BS EE-Math 84
Working for Microsoft is incrediblein no other company would you have the opportunity 
to write two different multi-tasking operating systems in a three-year period and see both 
of them hit the market!
 Larry Osterman, Design Engineer 
CMU, BS MathlCS '84
As a Program Manager , I have a lot of responsibility for making products come to life 
forcing people to consider the issues, to make the decisions, and to commit the resources to 
make the product happen. And the products I get to work on are incredibly important to the 
future of Microsofttheres a good deal of responsibility vested in me. Its probably the 
most creative job Ive ever hadthe solution space is wide open, its up to me to chart a 
path.
The first week I was here I met with Bill Gates, and this has been a frequent event since 
then. I dont know of many other Fortune 500 companies where that is the case. Its a very 
open decision-making environmentkey issues are laid out for everyone to comment on, 
and the ultimate decision is guided by whats right, not what side key people are on.
 John Ludwig, Program Manager 
CMU, MS EE, MS 1A 84
I worked in Applications Tools. I had ownership for my own sub-project which I hacked 
away on all summer. The time I spent at MS was incredibly intellectually stimulatingI 
learned more this summer than in the last semester of school. What I liked most about MS 
is that the developers really know what they are doing, and they genuinely love what they 
are doing as well. The enthusiasm is great.
 David Gray, Design Engineer 
Intern CMU. BS Math '89
During the summer at MS I improved several areas of Windows graphics layers focusing 
on performance issues. It was a great summer, everything is right at your hands in Seattle 
I did a lot of hiking and water skiing. The MS environment was great tooI set my own 
hours, wore whatever I wanted, had access to any beverage I wanted for free, and worked 
with the top of the line computer (Compaq 386/20). I found that MS goes out of their way 
to make working comfortable for you, and in turn, you work hard for them.

CMU Hockey looking 
for successful season
By DAVE WILLIS
Tartan Staffwriter
The story of the CMU hockey 
club this year sounds like some
thing out of a B movie. Some 
twenty dedicated players from 
a small school without a full
time coach or a genuine home 
rink pull together to form a 
team, then knock off the league 
powerhouses.
Carnegie Mellon hockey, al
though not recognized as a var
sity sport by the University, 
partly due to not having a home 
rink, has been competing in 
the Western Pennsylvania 
Club Hockey Association 
(WPCHA) for several years. 
The hockey club plays its 
home games at Kittaning, 
about an hour away.
The team has been run this 
season by the three co-captains, 
Todd Henderson, senior Denny 
Frey, and junior Mark Robson, 
with assistance from H&SS 
Dean Fienberg. According to 
Frey, the biggest difficulty with 
not having a coach was no one
to give actual instruction.That 
problem was resolved when 
Mark Licata recently took the 
position. He is expected to join 
the team this week.
With Saturdays 3-2 win at 
West Virginia, a game not de
cided until the winning goal 
was scored by Chris Galvin 
with 8 seconds to play in regu
lation, the Tartans improved 
to 3-1 in league play. Although 
the season is not quite half 
over (the Tartans play twice 
each against WPCHA foes West 
Virginia, Pitt, Slippery Rock, 
IUP, and Penn State), the Tar
tans have made solid progress 
toward the coveted champion
ship. With last years champ, 
Gannon, no longer in the 
league, Carnegie Mellon fig
ures to be in the running this 
year.
Allowed to dress only 20 play
ers per game, including two 
goalies, the Tartans have had 
the enviable problem of having 
too many players. The team 
roster has expanded to 24 this 
season.

The 1988-89 season is the last 
one for Jim Perkins as Carnegie 
Mellons swimming coach. He 
announced his resignation effec
tive March 31.
Perkins will move to Salt Lake 
City, Utah, where his wife, Kim
berly Adams of KDKA-TVs Eye
witness News, will become an 
anchorwoman for the ABC-TV 
affiliate. He hopes to continue to 
work there as a swimming coach 
as well. It was his wifes job as a 
medical reporter and substitute 
anchor at KDKA that brought him 
to Pittsburgh.
Perkins has brought the swim
ming team to great accomplish
ments, including improvement in 
size and quality. In two plus sea-' 
sons at Carnegie Mellon, Perkins 
has guided the Tartans to a 26-8 
overall record. Last winter, he led 
CMUs mens team to its first 
Presidents Athletic Conference 
(PAC) Championship in school 
history, and was named PAC 
Mens Coach of the Year for the 
second consecutive season. Perk
ins has produced six All-Ameri
cans at CMU.
In addition to being the swim
ming coach, he has also served as 
an instructor for the swimming 
and racquetball classes at CMU. 
Last semester, Perkins instructed

a First Aid class.
Prior to his appointment at 
Carnegie Mellon, Perkins coached 
the swim team at Ithaca College 
in New York. In three years, he 
produced 51 NCAA All-Americans 
and an NCAA Champion. He was 
head coach at Cornell University 
from 1975-80.
Perkins earned his Bachelors 
degree in 1971 from the Univer
sity of Florida, where he was an 
All-American breaststroker four 
times. At one time, he held the 
Southeastern Conference record 
in the 100- (:59.4) and 200-yard
(2:11.5) breaststroke. He received 
his Masters degree in 1974 from 
Auburn University, where he was 
an assistant to swimming coach 
Eddie Reese.
With the swimming season just 
getting underway, Perkins is very 
enthused about the team. Were 
doing very well right now, and: 
were going to do very well. I cant 
wait to start swimming some new 
meets.
This seasons team is in top 
shape because of the intense and 
long preparation initiated by 
Perkins. Were doing exception
ally well due to Florida training 
time. We did well because we 
already had a good foundation 
from which to work due to prac
ticing hard in the fall.
The men will continue to qual
ify for the nationals, while the 
women will qualify for the na
tionals for the first time this sea
son.
The team has also improved in 
other aspects under Perkins. 
They have done better in the 
dual meets, and the diving team 
has also improved. This year we 
took the first steps towards qual
ity diving practice. The diving 
team is flourishing, which is 
important because having a good 
swim team means having a good 
diving team because they score 
together, Perkins commented.
More importantly, the swim 
team has improved as a whole. 
Much of this is due to the in
creased size of the team brought 
by the recruiting work of Perkins. 
Weve gotten bigger and better, 
Perkins said. Were really look
ing forward to the UAA [Univer
sity Athletic Association] and the 
PAC Championships.
It looks as if Perkins will end 
his work here at CMU with much 
to be proud of. Right now, he 
continues to concentrate with the 
team on the rest of the season 
with excitement, Were ready to 
explode!
very hard to build up strength. 
After building up strength, the 
coach will gradually decrease the 
amount of yardage swum in favor 
of emphasis on technique and 
sprint skills.
Senior Hal Levine explained, 
When you are used to doing so 
much yardage for so long and then 
you are doing next to nothing, you 
build up energy for the race. Its 
like how people feel after finals. 
You study for two weeks straight, 
then you go home, and your mom 
feeds you dinner as you watch 
cartoons. Well, tapering is sort of 
the sensation of lying in the couch 
with all that built up energy from 
studying.
The mens current record is 3-0 
and the womens record is 2-1. 
Both teams next race on Satur
day, January 28 at Bethany.

Just their signature
Its never been difficult for students to con
vince their parents of the need for a Macintosh 
computer at school.
Persuading them to write the check, however, 
is another thing altogether.
Which is why Apple created the Student Loan 
to-Own Program. An ingenious loan program 
that makes buying a Macintosh as easy as using 
one.
Simply pick up an application at the location 
listed below, or call 800-831-LOAN. All 
your parents need to do is fill it out,
sign it, and send it. If they qualify, theyll receive 
a check for you in just a few weeks.
Theres no collateral. No need to prove finan
cial hardship. No application fee.
Best of all, the loan payments can be spread 
over as many as 10 years.
Which gives you and your parents plenty of 
time to decide just who pays for it all.

fartan Contributing Editor
CHICAGO  There may be a 
I light at the end of the mens basetball Tartans tunnel. However, 
levery time a glimmer of hope has 
Lppeared, its disappeared just as 
[quicklyAfter an 0 for 88 start, 
I the team won three of its next 
Ifive; however, once again the team 
L, jhe midst of a losing streak and 
ICMU is now 3-11,2-5 University 
Athletic Association (UAA), 1-2 
Presidents Athletic Conference 
|(PAC).
This week, the Tartans dropped 
[three games, 75-59 to Grove City 
1(10-4, 2-1 PAC), 59-57 to Wash
ington (10-5, 3-2 UAA), and 67-58 
[to Chicago (4-12, 3-4 UAA).
The Tartans have been unable 
|to put together 40 minutes of solid 
asketball all season. Im confi
dent that we can play a lot bet
s'ter, asserted co-captain Darryl 
(Long. Head Coach Larry AnderIson agrees, I would like to think 
that the team is getting better, 
[he claimed.
However, problems continued 
(against the Maroons. The team 
; off to a quick start taking a 
Ifive point lead early in the first 
|half. Shooting problems then 
lensued; Carnegie Mellon man1 to hit only 10 of 27 first half 
ishots and Chicago took command 
[ofthe game. They built a 14 point 
[ lead, and led 37-27 at the half. 
Led by senior cocaptain Daren 
Woffatt and his 18 points, the 
Tartans tried to mount a secondhalf comeback. However, every 
Itime CMU got within six points, 
| the team stalled and could get no 
[closer to the Maroons. They got 
within four points, 62-58, late in 
the game, but that was the closest 
'they would get.
The loss came on the heels of a 
heartbreaker against Washing
ton. The Bears came to Skibo Gym 
ranked fifth in the Midwest Re
gion. They were on the final leg of 
road trip that had included 
flosses at Rochester and Brandeis. 
Washingtons fatigue showed 
early with both teams getting off 
J slow starts.
| The Tartans took an early lead, 
[but Washington came back with 
Carnegie Mellons nemesis, the 
ithree-point shot. Three straight 
ombs by Rick Robinson and 
Kevin OConnell gave the Bears a 
|S-14 lead midway through the 
first half.
The game continued at its slow 
pace, with each team suffering 
Y spells. Carnegie Mellon moved 
lout to a five point lead, only to
watch Washington, led by Scott 
Owens, come back to score the 
nexteight points. However, clutch 
shooting by Long and freshman 
Rob Sechan gave the Tartans a 
35-31 halftime lead.
Carnegie Mellon built their lead 
with excellent first-half shooting, 
16 of 25 from the floor. They lost 
their lead the same way, by hit
ting only 9 of 34 in the second 
half. An eight minute dry spell 
late in the second half allowed the 
Bears to stay in the game.
With 2:11 to go, Long hit two 
free throws to tie the game at 49, 
but OConnell hit two three-point
ers to give Washington their big
gest lead of the night. The Tar
tans closed to two with a second to 
go, but the Bears were able to 
inbound the ball and ice the game.
Earlier in the week, Carnegie 
Mellon faced off against the Grove 
City Wolverines. The Wolverines 
are off to their best start since 
entering the PAC and have al
ready knocked off preseason fa
vorite John Carroll.
The Wolverines grabbed an 
early lead behind the three-point 
shooting of Jim Barr. Barr hit 
four of them in the first half as 
Grove City built a nine point 
halftime lead, 39-30.
The Tartans adjusted in the 
second half, moving Long outside 
to stop the outside shots. Numer
ous trips to the free-throw line 
allowed Carnegie Mellon to 
outscore Grove City 15-6 in the 
first ten minutes, tying the game. 
The game grew increasingly rough 
as the referees called a very tight 
game, sending the Tartans two 
bigmen, Daren Moffatt and Chris 
Luckett, to the bench early in the 
half with four fouls apiece.
With Carnegie Mellon forced 
into a smaller lineup, the Wolver
ines pounced. Grove Citys larger 
lineup produced rebounds and the 
Wolverines rebuilt their lead. 
CMU closed to within five, but 
after the third Tartan player 
fouled out, Grove City ran off nine 
unanswered points from the free 
throw line to end the game.
The year had started betterfor
the Tartans. 1989 started 
with a stunning win over 
18th-ranked Rochester,
83-70. The Tartans came 
back from a first-half 
deficit behind freshman 
guard Philip Bronner. 
Bronner scored 22 points 
and had four assists on 
the way to the victory.
The next day, they 
nipped Johns Hopkins,
79-77. Again Bronner was 
the star with 19 points, 
including five from the 
free-throw line in the fi
nal minute. For his ef
forts, Bronner was named 
UAA mens basketball 
athlete of the week.
The Tartans fell short 
in their next outing, at 
New YorkUniversity. The 
Violets grabbed a 41-28 
first-half lead behind 
shooting of Rob Remhild 
and Jay Conway. NYU 
won the game 88-76.
CMU also lost Bronner 
for the season after the 
game, a torn cartilage has side
lined the starter for the rest of the 
year.
The Tartans spilt their first two 
PAC games, losing to John Car
roll at home, 76-62, and beating 
Hiram on the road, for the teams 
only road victory, 70-61.
Cl'c 1ll:Q Tomorrow night, 
the Tartans take on Washington 
& Jefferson College (6-7, 2-2) at 
Skibo Gym. The Presidents are 
led by a pair of all-PAC players, 
Danny Jones and Dave Branchen. 
Branchen is fourth in the PAC in 
scoring with 18.7 ppg with Jones 
adding 14.1 per game.
Saturday, CMU travels to 
Greenville to take on the Thiel 
Tomcats (0-3, 1-12). Thiel gives 
up points by the bushelfull, aver
aging over 85 points scored 
against them per game, worst in 
the PAC. Ayoung team, with only 
three lettermen returning, the 
Tomcats are trying to rebuild 
under second-year coach Jes 
Huston. Saturdays game will be 
on WRCT (88.3).

A lot of runners take the PAC 
championship for granted because 
weve won it so many times. Its 
going to be difficult to go into 
regionals and nationals without 
something like the PAC champi
onship under our belts. The UAA 
will be a lot tougher to do well in.
According to womens basket
ball coach Gerri Seidl, competi
tion in the UAA is tougher than in 
the PAC. But I would prefer to be 
in a harder conference. Weve 
always set up a tough schedule 
because thats the only way you 
get better, by playing the better 
teams.
With the departure of Carnegie 
Mellon, John Carroll and Hiram, 
membership in the PAC will be 
down to a mere four teams: Wash
ington & Jefferson, Thiel, Grove 
City and Bethany. The future of 
the conference is uncertain, and 
several options are being consid
ered.
There are basically three di
rections being explored, ex
plained W & J Athletic Director 
John Luckhardt. One is that we 
reorganize locally, absorbing 
other small, liberal arts schools 
with the same kinds of standards
we have. Another is affiliation 
with a larger league, and the third 
option is that we merge with 
neighboring small schools in New 
York or Virginia.
There is hope that the PAC will 
continue, as it has been in exis
tence since 1955, and has a repu
tation for excellence in a variety 
of areas. The league has a long 
standing tradition of high aca
demic standards to complement 
its intense athletic rivalries and 
competition.
The thing I like best about the 
PAC is that the league has main
tained a very clear perspective on 
athletics on a collegiate level, 
said Luckhardt. The emphasis is 
on success and performance in 
the classroom first, and as impor
tant as athletics are, development 
in athletics takes second place to 
development in learning. 
Wherever the remaining Presi
dents Athletic Conference teams 
settle, it seems that everyone 
wants to see continued interac
tion between the teams that once 
constituted the PAC. Elliot com
mented that CMU looks forward 
to the possibility of continued 
competition against the PAC 
schools.
