Ihe Welfare Drive,, sponsored by 
Student Council, will begin on 
Carnegie campus on November' 
d will continue until November 
lhis drive, the only one of its 
I sponsored by Carnegie, is 
of the national movement to 
.gurelief for unemployment and 
sill charitable organizations. 
r1^ Thomas S. Baker, in comJng on the drive, stated, It 
(been customary for Carnegie Xer its services to the annual are .campaign. The students i always been willing to help, 
it is to their credit that they i done so; I am certain that  will again this year donate r full share../ery students is requested to .tribute at least one dollar, e drive will be handled through as representatives, there being person in each class who will lect all contributions of' that rtlcular group. A card on -which 11 appear the name of the stunt will be given to him, and he it return it with his donation, is hoped that the sum raised 'Allegheny County will exceed quota. This money will be tributed to over seventy differagpneies in the city of Pittslh;; and'will also go towards! i relief of unemployment oughout the country. John Pi :tz, chairman of the drive . appointed a committee of four,< from each college, to take Vge of the collections jn their .,ective schools. This commitincludes James E. Halferty, oge of Engineering-1' Edmund jfcCormick, College of Indusi; Rosemarie Saxton, College of ! Arts; and Jean llitzel, Marlt Morrison.
M it is the object of the Wel3 Drive Association to serve the n and women of Carnegie, revidless of creed, in every posslway, and to surround the stus with such' iniluenco as shall them to live successful lives, VY Is asking the students to procate in donating what they to aid others.
The1 registration figures obtained from the Registrars office indicate that the enrollment in the night college at Carnegie will be under that of last year. The number of students registered at the time these figures were obtained shows that there were' 585 entered in the Night College of Engineering, 791 in the Night College of Industries, and 420 in the Night College of Fine Arts. These figures will be changed materially at the end of the semester since registration for some of the courses is still open and will continue until the', 
classes are filled.These figures contrasted with 
those of day school indicate that while the enrollment in the day 
classes remained normal, or nearly so, a drop of upwards of 900 is revealed in the night school. This drop is not to be wondered .at since
there are several factors which enter into the enrollment of the night 
students. One of the chief reasons is that a great number of the stu
dents are engaged in full time employment during the day, but because of the curtailment and retrenchment in the business world their earnings have been considerably reduced and their economic status is such that enrolling in a 
night course in most cases has to be deferred.The courses offered at night serve many groups and classes of students. They are in essence more or less special since the students may take, in most cases, the subjects which fit their particular needs. Then too, college graduates are afforded opportunities of specializing in a particular field which will supplement their daily occu
pation.

telligence Tests Show Freshman

Yes, the ? of the tests are important0 reasons. Thoy rate each (dual student on a scale for ctlng his scholarship; and facilitate a class rating by arisoh with results of previrarirs.

They are usedstudents in making a suc)f their college work. Adand department heads frey consult these ratings when sting plans for study proto students, outside work, ing' subjects, and scheduled
Then, in rating the freshmen as a group in comparison with other classes, there is found to be very little difference in ability from 
year to year. The mental quality of classes since 1926, when the present tests were instituted, has changed but little. The average scores are tabulated as follows:1927-28Two and half per cent below that of 1926-27.1928-29One half per cent above that of 1926-27.1929-30Four per cent below that of 1926-27.1930-31Two per cent above that of 1926-27.1931-32One and half per cent above that of 1926-27.1932-33Two and half per cent 
above that of 1926-27.There are practically no significant differences involved during all these years; since any variation of less than two per cent is of no consequence because of statistical factors involved.
The Intelligence Tests are given under the supervision of Dr. Max Sclioen, head of the Department of Psychology and Education. The tests used are the Carnegie Mental Ability Examinations compiled by Profoccnr Plpeton, and the Carnegie High School Mental Achievement Examination, compiled by Dr. Schaffer and Professor Cleeton.

Billy Weixel Will 
Play At Football 
Dance Saturday
The genial Billy 'Weixel and His Famous Orchestra were so enthusiastically received at the Washington arid Jefferson Football Dance two weeks ago, that, the committee in charge of Temple Football Dance in Thistle HalL next Saturday  evening has made rangements to have him play for this fifth Saturday evening football dance of the present school year.
This orchestra, which played all summer at Bemus Point and Van Buren Bay in New Yoik, has already been signed for this year's 
Intercollegiate Ball to be held in the Hotel William Penn on Christmas evening. In addition to playing for many prominent college social affairs, Billy Weixel has broadcast over both the National and Columbia Broadcasting chains, well as over four of the Pittsburgh radio stations.
The admission price for the dance will be the usual 1.00 a couple charge. Dancing will continue from 9 to 12 oclock. The football dances are sponsored >by Dragons, mens senior class honorary society.
At the Notre Dame Football Dance last Saturday evening card tables and cards were placed in the foyer for the chaperones for the first time this year. Several dozen additional chairs were also placed around the floor to accommodate the dancers between dances.

Instead of the play previously 
announced, Ann Vroome by 
Lewis Beach will open next Friday 
evening in the Little Theater un
der the direction of Professor 
Chester Wallace. Six evening per
formances will be given through to 
Thursday, November 3, with a 
matinee performance on Thursday.
The plays of Lewis Beach are a 
little different than those of most 
Broadway playwrights in that they 
interpret and study.American life 
sincerely rather than in the usual 
stereotyped theatrical manner.
Ann Vroome has been pro
duced. once professionally. The 
performances to be given by the 
Department of Drama will use a 
text recently revised by Mr. Beach. Such interest has been shown in this new version that Ann Vroome probably will be produced again professionally.Technically, the seven scenes called for in the script involve the solution of difficult staging problems. To facilitate these scene 
changes, use will be made of two triangular platforms mounted on casters to which the scenery for several sets will be fastened. Models of two of the interior sets used in this production, ruade by Mr. Weninger, will be shown at the Carnegie Institute Art Exhibit next .month.'Margaret P. Goldberg is the book-holder and assistant to the director. The cast of players is as follows: Ann VroomeFern G.Ball, Dorothy M. Devlin; Boyd HollidayCharles S. Frost, William E.

To Military Ball
The Military Ball Number of the

What? No Rabbits! My, How This 
Campus Has Changed In 20 Years!
By PETER
Now that the hunting season is on, 
how would you like to don your 
high-top boots and sheepskin coat 
and go hunting on the campus? Yes, thats what was done, in the days of 05, when men were men and plebes didnt offer challenges. The place was just infested with wild rabbits, an old-timer of the faculty was telling me the other day. Where the quadrangle and cut are now, the trees were so large and thick that it took an 
hour to get to Forbes street.And you could get to Forbes street by the long way without 
crossing a bridge. Where Carnegie stands now was a deep hollow, level with the railroad tracks. And oh, those trains! They used coal when coming up this way, and made a smoke screen so thick and black that even the white horses 
parked on the road were invisible. The horses, as you might have surmised by now, dear Plebe, belonged to the students. The first automobile seen on the campus was a one cylinder Buick which grunted its way up the road in 
1906. Automobiles were as yet only heavy monsters which fright
ened Carnegie Co-eds.Surely there were no women at Carnegie in those days, I ventured. And with a laugh the oldV. PAULUS
timer (thats what he called himself) related to me how once when presenting a play the girls had no dressing room and used his office in which to change costumes. Yes, there were women here, and Margaret Morrison was situated in the present Carpentry Shop. Incidentally, thats as far as the College of Industries extended. It was the only building, too, and all tho laboratories and classrooms were 
crowded into it.What about the topography of the land around here then?" I asked. Again he laughed. You should have seen it, he said, 
Hundreds of thousands of cubic yards of earth were used to fill tho place. The ground 011 which Ma
chinery Hall stands was all carried there; where the College of Flue Arts stands was a'-high hill. Have you ever noticed a crack which runs up and down the wall of the Machine Shop? Thats what happened when that part of the building sunk In the rather loose ground. A general laboratory building was built next to Indus
tries Building, but the whole structure fell away and smashed on account of the weak foundation. The 
large concrete columns that are still protruding above the ground on the side of the slope next to the (Continued on Page Three)

Students And Faculty Will Vote In 9:30 Classes 
Tomorrow Morning; Tartan Holds Straw 
Vote In Conjunction With Princeton
By JOE ADAMS
Tomorrow morning during the 9:30-10:30 class period bal
lots on which students and faculty members will indicate their 
choice of candidates for president in the Tartan straw vote 
will be passed out in all classes.
By means of the class room poll, a large percentage of the 
students and faculty will vote and thereby allow an accurate 
reckoning of which candidate Carnegie favors. The ballots will 
not only record the name of the candidate preferred but also 
the sex, college, age and home state of the voter. These classi
fications will enable the Tartan to'^ 
give a detailed account of the poll,
Faculty members will vote on 
pink ballots and students will vote 
on white ones in order to avoid any 
chance of student and faculty votes 
becoming confused. Tartan has 
arranged to have the ballots dis
tributed by 9:30 and have them 
collected by 10:30. Some time dur
ing the intervening hour the bal
lots will be distributed by the in
structor in charge of every class in 
session so that all students in class 
at tbat time will vote. Any facul
ty members who do not have a class during the hour of the poll 
and wish to vote can do so at the Y office any time before 4:30 tomorrow afternoon. This extensive 
type of straw vote lias been made possible through the co-operation

of the poll at Carnegie will be compared with that of the polls held at other colleges.
F ranco - German 
Amity Necessary 
Says Economist
New York, N. Y.(NSFA)The 
third series of National Student Federation broadcasts opened on Monday, October 3, with an address by Dr. C. R. Hennings, a graduate of the University of Freiburg and an 
expert on economic conditions in Europe.Speaking on the subject, "Germanys Right to Re-arm, Dr. Hennings outlined the circumstances leading up to the recent withdrawal of Germany from the Disarmament Conference at Geneva and the part that the Versailles Treaty has played in the present tense situation. Franco-German understanding is the keynote to a healthy condition of Europe, said Dr. Hennings. When Germany 
had to disarm under the peace treaty, her national security was, of course, not considered. When 
in 1926 she-joined the League of Nations sho became entitled to equal standing with all other members. Will Germany re-arm? Germany will co-operate in any general disarmament. She only wants equal treatment, not an increase in her armaments necessarily.Through the courtesy of the Columbia Broadcasting System, the programs will continue weekly on Monday afternoons from 2:00 to 2:15 oclock, Eastern Standard Time. Announcements of future speakers will be made as the fall schedule is completed.
National Student, 
Federation PlansTrip
New York, N. Y (NSFA)At the invitation of the National Student Federation, a group of between twenty and thirty South African students will tour the United States in January, 1933. The trip will start from New York and will include Pittsburgh. Chicago. Cleveland, Buffalo, and many 
of the colleges in the east and 
middle west.Plans are also being made for the entertainment, of a group of French students in the country in the fall of 1933.
By WILLIAM LANDSBERGIn order that Tartan readers may know something about the lives of the presidential candidates, the following brief resume of the lives of the candidates and a short, course summary of their past accomplishments are presented:Herbert Hoover.
Herbert Clark Hoover was born into comparative poverty, at West Branch. Iowa, on August 10, 1874, 
At the age of 13, he went to work, preparing himself at night school to enter Stanford University. Admitted in 1895, he majored in geology and mining. After graduation in 1895 he undertook engineering work on mines, railways and metallurgical projects which carried him 
to all parts of the globeCanada, Australia, Great Britain, South Africa, Mexico, Italy, India, China, Russia and United States. While in China, he was chief engineer of the governments bureau of mines. At the time of the Boxer uprising he helped organize relief and resistance in Peking. Rising steadily in his field, he became partner in an international engineering firm and finally established his own engineering company in 1907 with offices in several countries. By 1913, the firms of which he was executive engineer were employing 175,- 000 men, who it is said, never 
struck once.At the outbreak of the World War, he organized relief for stranded Americans abroad, and following this, he administered Belgian relief. With Americas entrance into the war he became war-time food administrator and chairman of numerous important food canneries and corporations. 1-Ie was also in charge of post-war relief, during - which time he refused to permit European control. He insisted on keeping it in American hands.In 1920, President Harding appointed him Secretary of Commerce, which position he held until his election to the presidency in 1928. As Secretary of Commerce, he reorganized the department and aided trade. He has spoken vigorously against all kinds of collectivism and is /an outstanding exponent of individualistic economics.Older charges against Mr. Hoover are that he shares the usual ideas of imperialism, has 
adopted a "hard-boiled attitude toward foreign labor, and has alternately or at the same time adopted both views on armaments in order to win the support of both armament and pacifist groups. The present-day critics point to his failure to admit the existence of the depression, thereby causing needless suffering and delaying remedies.Franklin D. Roosevelt.
Franklin Delano Roosevelt was born of well-to-do parents at Hyde Park, New York, on January 30, 
1882. He attended private secondary schools, matriculated at Harvard and following graduation, enrolled at Columbia Law School. In 1907, he was admitted to the bar and practiced law for three years. He was a member of the New York Senate from 1910-1913, gaining a reputation for progressivism by bucking the Murpliy-Tammany machine.
He was appointed Assistant Secretary of the Navy, which position he held until 1920. At the 
close of the World War he was in charge of demobilization in Europe. 
He was candidate for Vice President of the United States in 1920. He has been elected Governor of New York state twice, his present term expiring next year.
Rarely have his bitterest political opponents found fault with his human qualities. He is democratic, possesses at times a certain engaging humility and open-mind
edness and withal is given general credit for possessing a distinctly pleasing personality.His recovery from a stroke of in
fantile paralysis in 1921 is a veritable epic of fortitude. 1-Ie has worked as Governor for reform of 
the budget, has relieved farmers from taxes, has initiated measures looking toward a land utilization program by placing people on farms, and lias taken an attitude of strong regulation toward power companies, advocating public oaviiersliip of plants.Against Mr. Rosevelt, critics contend that he is notably indecisive and weak when a bold attitude on ;i question might embarass his political chances. They charge that he has never really understood the 
power issue, that he has talked of the need of a shorter working day and unemployment relief, but has failed to do anything about it whilr 
serving as Governor of New York. Also it is claimed that although he talks of peaceful world relations,

Seven Main Issues Feature Platforms
Platforms Of 3 Major 
Parties Presented 
By The Tartan
Following is presented a sum
mary of comparisons of the major 
issues among the Republican, Dem
ocratic, and Socialist platforms. 
While the complete platforms are 
not presented, this compainson is given to show the differences, if any, between the stands taken by each of the parties on these main issues. For more detailed analysis, the full party platforms should be consulted. In the case of the Socialist party, there are several sections of the platform that differ so radically from those of the others that the complete Socialist platform should be read. Space 
does not permit the inclusion of these parts here.Unemployment and Relief.Republican. We believe in the 
principle of high wages. We favor the principle of the shorter working week and shorter work day, 
with its application to government as well as to private employment as rapidly and as constructively as conditions will warrant. To provide against the possible failure of local and state agencies to care for unemployed, the President has 
urged the Congress to create an emergency relief fund to be loaned temporarily to any state on a showing of actual need and temporary failure of its financial resources.Democratic. We advocate the extension of federal credit to states for unemployment relief wherever diminishing resourecs of states make it impossible to provide for the needy; expansion of the federal program of necessary, useful construction affected with 
public interest; spread of employment by a substantial reduction in hours of labor, encouragement of shorter week by applying principle in government service; planning of public works; i unemployment and old age insurance under state laws.Socialist. Federal appropriation of $5,000,000,000 for immediate re
lief to supplement state and local appropriations; Federal appropriation of $5,000,000,000 for public 
works and roads, reforestation, slum clearance and decent homes for worker, by federal government, states, and cities; legislation for acquisition of land, buildings, and equipment necessary to put unemployed to work producing food, fuel, and clothing and for erection
of house for own use; six-hour day 
and five-day week without rduction of wages; free public employment agencies; compulsory system of unemployment compensation with adequate benefits, based on contributions by govern
ment and employers; old age pensions for men and women over 60. years of age; health and maternity insurance; improved sys
tems of workmens compensation and accident insurance; abolition of child labor; adequate minimum 
wage laws.ProhibitionRepublican: Submission to spe
cial State conventions of a proposed amendment to allow States to deal with the liquor problems as their citizens may determine, 
but subject to the power of the Federal government to protect 
those States where prohibition may exist and sareguard citizens everywhere from the return of the 
saloon, pledges continued effort of law enforcement.Democratic: Advocates repealof the Eighteenth Amendment by 
Congress immediately, proposing amendment at representative state conventions called solely to act on tbat proposal; urges enactment by states of such measures as will actually promote temperance, prevent the return of the saloon, and bring the liquor traffic into the open and under state control; demands that federal government protect dry states from importation of intoxi
cating liquors in violation of their laws; favors immediate modification of the Volstead Act to legalize manufacture and sale of beer and alcoholic beverages permissible under Constitution and to provide for revenue therefrom.Socialist: Repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment and take over the liquor industry under government ownership and control, with the right of local option for each state to maintain prohibition within its borders.AgricultureRepublican: The fundamentalproblem of American agriculture is the control of productionto such volume as will balance supply with demand. In the solution of this problem, the co-operative organization of farmers, to plan produc
tion, and the tariff, to hold the home market for American farm
ers, are vital elements; a third element equally vital is the control of acreage of land under cultivation to balance production.Democratic: Advocates betterfinancing of farm mortgages 
through recognized farm bank
THE SURROUNDING WORLD
By JOE ADAMS
Franklin Delano Roosevelt has 
swung into the height of his second campaign trip with a key speech Pittsburgh last Wednesday night. All has not been so rosy with this smiling candidate since his nth cousin, Alice Roosevelt Longwortli, has come out for Hoover one hundred percent. She says that she and her father, Theodore Rosevelt, and his entire 
branch of the family have always been Republicans and that they would vote for Hoover, To compensate for these cutting remarks. Roosevelt has gained as allies Phil LaFollette, who was recently defeated for re-election as governor 
of Wisconsin, and Father Cox, who has withdrawn from the presidential race to aid Roosevelt.
Herbert Hoover has been having his unhappy moments as well his opponent. Henry Ford, thinking that lie would help 
Hoover, requested his employees to vote for Hoover and by doing 
enraged a great many oeople sothat he doubtlessly >ost more votes than he gained for the Republican party Calvin
Coolidge has been doing all that he can to bolster the Republican cause, and, consequently, has saved many a vote from going astray.
Things seem to be stirring over in the Orient where Japan has set up the state of Manchukuo with none other than the ex-emperor of China, Pu-yi, as Regent. Naturally, he does not feel any too amiable towards the government which deprived him of a throne. As things stand now, Pu-yi is little less than a puppet in the hands of the 
Japanese government which befriended him during his unfortunate years after he was forced to leave China.Many nations are objecting to Japans obvious moves in gaining control of the Manchurian Peninsula. As a matter of fact, the League of Nations has told Japan to halt and retreat in some 100,000 
words. As a result we still Jind Japanese troops in Manchuria. There is no doubt that if the League continues its course of levity and mere warnings, the joy-ride of the Tokyo militarists will continue. The only way that they can be
agencies at low rate of interest on amortization plan, giving preference to credits for redemption of farms and homes sold under foreclosure; extension and development of Farm Co-operative move
ment and effective control of crop surpluses so that farmer will have full benefit of home market; enactment of constitutional measure to aid farmers to receive for their basic farm commodities prices in excess of cost.Socialist: Favors the reductionof tax burdens, by a shift from taxes on farm property to taxes on incomes, inheritances, excess prof
its, and other similar forms of taxation; increased federal and state subsidies to road building and educational and social services for rural communities; certain of federal marketing agency for agricultu
ral products; acquisition by cooperative societies and governmental agencies of grain elevators, stockyards, packing houses, and warehouses and the conduct of these services on a non-profit basis; socialization of federal land banks and extension of long-term credit to farmers at low rates of interest; social insurance for losses which are due to adverse weather conditions; creation of national, regional, and state land utilization boards for discovering best uses of farm land in view of joint needs of agriculture, industry, rec
reation, wjater supply, reforestation, etc.
Veterans
Republican: Believes that every 
veteran incapacitated in any degree by reason of illness or injuries attributable to service in defense of his country should be cared for and compensated, so fa as compensation is possible, by a grateful nation, and that the dependents of those who lost their lives in war or whose death since the war in which service was rendered is traceable to service causes, should be provided for adequately.Democratic: We advocate full
measure of justice and generosity for all war veterans who have suffered disability or disease caused by, or resulting from, actual serv
ice in time of war, and for their dependents.Socialist: No statement.Public EconomyRepublican: Prompt and drasticreduction of public expenditures and resistance to every appropriation not demonstrably necessary to the performance of the essential functions of government, national or local; efficiency and economy destopped is by application of pressure by the League.
The United States of Soviet Rus
sia has come out with a definite stand on the armament question. In brief, they say that disarmament is impossible in this doomed 
capitalistic world. They claim that they see signs of more armament on all sides rather than disarmament. To cap the situation, the claim is made that despite the obvious strained relationshipss' between many countries they all seem to be mutually antagnotistic towards Russia. With conditions 
existing such as these armaments 
can not help but increase.Just how significant or important these statements are is hard to estimate. However, there is much truth in many of the remarks, although I believe that Russia has overestimated the antagonism of the other nations toward her. There is no doubt that many nations have been arming instead of disarming. The fact that Germany is fighting to make headway in her demands for equal status in armament with the rest of Europe shows that all is not so quiet on the Western Front.
In Mahatma Gliandis India, we find that the Moslem and Hindu

mand reorganization of government bureaus; favors legislation giving the President power to effect such reduction.Democratic Advocates reduction of governmental expenditures by abolishing useless commissions and offices, consolidating departments and biireaus, eliminating extravagance, to save at a minimum, 
twenty-five per cent in the. cost of government.Socialist: Advocate public ownership and democratic control of mines, forests, oil, power utilities dealing with light and power, transportation and communication, and all basic industries.Tariff
Republican: Extensions of thegeneral Republican principle of tariff protection to our natural re
sources industries, including the products of our farms, forests, 
mines, and oil wells, with compensatory duties on the manufactured and refined products thereof.Democratic: Advocates competi
tive tariff for revenue with factfinding tariff commission free from 
executive intereference; reciprocal agreements with other nations, and internatiornal economic conference to restore international trade.FinanceRepublican: The Republicanparty established and will continue to uphold the gold standard and will oppose any measure which will 
undermine the governments credit or impair the integrity of our national currency.Democratic: Favors maintenance of national credit by budget balanced on basis of accurate ex
ecutive estimates within revenue raised by taxation on principle of ability to pay; advocates preservation of sound currency at all hazards and international monetary conference called by the United States to consider rehabilization of silver and related questions.Socialist: Socialization of credit
and currency system and the establishment of a unified banking system, beginning with the complete governmental acquisition of the Federal Reserve Banks and the 
extension of the services of the Postal Savings Banks to cover all departments of the banking business and the transference of this department of the post office to a government-owned banking corpor
ation.
women can co-operate even though the men like to riot as they are organizing under the joint leader
ship of a Hindu and a Moslem in their bid for political equality. England cant see it the same way as the women do, and so, the suffragette movement, once rampant in this country, is beginning to pop up in the East. The women of India have stated that they do not wish to be divided on a racial or religious basis. If granting the women in India the right to vote 
would end the continual strife between the Hindus and the Mos
lems, I should say that the English will have found an easy solution to a troublesome situation.
The bandits in the Balkan mountains are being captured and killed when in flight in such largo quantities that soon they will all be gone. When the hills have been entirely cleared of these colorful marauders, who claim that they 
lead a Robin Hood life, the Balkans will have lost the last of the old Macedonian warriors. The 
decline of Komitadji, as the bandits are called, may result in bogus bandit entertainment for travelers in motor-coaches in the Balkans similar to that of the Apaches in 
Paris.

The time is long past when the American voter could c

of affairs economic arid political in Europe. Of course, An; 
cans as a rule have been characterized by an abysmal pro-s 
cialism in the pasta shortsightedness and gaucherie which 1

Tartan Staff Asks Full 
Cooperation From 
Student Body
By MARGARET GRIFFINIn conjunction with the political poll which is being held on the campus tomorrow, at 9:30 a. m., several interested members of the Carnegie faculty have expressed their personal opinion of the poll. The Tartan is making a determined effort to impress the student body with the fact that the project if responded to seriously and in the right attitude, may provide results which will be compared with the results of similar polls taken in other colleges in the country."The Tartan, says Mr. Tarbell, Dean of Men, "is making a very earnest effort to secure an adequate presidential poll on the campus. It is to be hoped that every student will co-operate by casting a ballot when the voting day comes in order that the result may be genuinely representative."Alan Bright, Registrar, believes that the opinions of the public and of students often arrive at sharp angles to each other, and that the opinions of students of economics, in particular, should reveal a decided interest in public affairs. The poll, according to Mr. Bright, should be an interesting test of how interested college students are. 1-Ie believes that, if managed correctly and if taken seriously, the straw vote will prove exceptionally interesting.Dr. Schoen ApprovesDr. Max Schoen, professor of psychology, considers the poll a wholesome, worthwhile undertalc1 ing if it stimulates the student body to give some serious thought to national problems. There lias been a good deal of complaint, Dr. Schoen continued, in his interview, "that young America displays no interest in political matters, and anything that would stimulate such an Interest is to be encouraged.Upon being asked if he thought that any material value could be derived from the balloting, Dr. Schoen replied in the affirmative, "since it is bound to arouse some discussion among the student body as to the relative merits of the. major candidates. We have been suffering from the unfortunate notion that schools are no place for political discussion, he continues, "but if such matters are not dis
cussed in schools where, then, can the young man or young woman get an impartial and intelligent 
evaluation? Certainly not in the newspapers.The student poll, ,said Dr. Ihrig, "should encourage students to give thought to political questions. They will everlastingly have questions like that coming up, and the vote will tend to bring to their attention the fact that they are going to have just as much part in the government as Teddy Roosevelt.Mr. Jewett, Director of the College of Industries, says: It isvery important that the college student begin to take an interest in public affairs. This poll should be valuable in that it will direct interest toward that sort of thing. When asked if he thought that the students would have sufficient background to respond adequately to such a vote, Mr. Jewett said that the college student has an 
intelligence far above the aver
age, if he reads the newspapers and listens to discussions. He usually has an opinion of his own . reasoned and weighted opinionand the straw ballot should certainly be indicative of something, although it will not show how the presidential vote will go in any particular district.Glad of Chance"I am glad, states, Dr. Webster N. Jones, newly appointed Director in the College of Engineering, that the Tartan is affording us the privilege of expressing our collective political preference. I shall compare with interest the results of our student vote with the actual vote on November 8.Dr. Charles Watkins, Director of Margaret Morrison, summarizes the opinions of the other faculty members. He says:
"While the results of a straw vote taken in our small group will not supply information of great value in predicting the outcome of the November election, I feel It is an effort In'the right direction. The interest of the students in national affairs is an encouraging sign. Perhaps the time will come when this body wil be sufficiently interested to stage an election which wilt involve a thorough knowledge of election laws and which will give our future officers and voters an opportunity to acquire valuable experience before undertaking the duties they must 
some day assume.

Newman Gives 
Travel Talks 
At Music Hall
Tickets For Lectures 
Sold At Mellors 
Music Store
The third of a series of five epi
sodes of a fifty-thousand mile jour
ney around the world will be pre
sented by E. M. Newman, master 
traveler and lecturer, in the Car
negie Music Hall tonight at S:15.
Mr. Newman, well-known for his 
Vitaphone Travel Talks which are 
being shown in all Warner Broth
ers theaters, begins the third episode of his tour in Singapore, the 
city with a jumbled mixture of Oriental people. From Singapore 
he will take his audience to Java, where the wealth of the interest is centered in a well-managed Dutch colony and its Buddhist inhabi
tants; from there to Sulu, one of the islands of the Philippine group; then to Luzon and Manila; and finally to Hongkong, a British pos
session, but preponderantly Chinese, and to Canton with its. crowded, narrow streets and its amazing life on land and in .boats.
This is the first time the fiftythousand mile jaunt around the globe has ever been assembled in a series of five travel-talks, and extreme care has been exercised in the selection of still color and motion picture scenes so that nothing of interest will, be overlooked on or off the beaten path. In presenting this extensive tour, Mr. 
Newman brings to the public the most complete itinerary and most ambitious program that he has ever assembled.One of the many advantages in traveling with Mr. Newman in 
these lectures is that the public shares many privileges that he enjoys in foreign countries that are denied to ordinary tourists and sees many forbidden places and carefully guarded treasures.
The travel-talks began on Tuesday evening, October 11 and will continue each Tuesday until November 8. Tickets for the lectures are on sale at Mellors Music Store, 604 Wood street, Pittsburgh. 
Prices of the tickets are -$1.65, $1.10 and $.50.

Many Changes Seen
In Past 20 Years
' Continued From Page 1
Science Building were built to be the foundations of Engineering Hall. The ground all caved in cov
ering many tons of steel that have never been recovered.
Were there any athletic teams at Carnegie as yet, and what did they use for a field? I inquired. 
Arid how he must have marvelled at my ignorance! You never heard of Carnegie's famous baseball teams? he asked, surprised. Why, 
they were the talk of the country. Forbes Field was the ball park then, but it was located on higher ground than it is now. It was1 enclosed by a fence and a home run Was really a home run. The ball, 
going over the fence, was forever lost in the deep hollow below. But Barney Dreyfuss got the idea to use that place for his ball team, so our boys had to move.
The pr'esent athletic field was 
an appropriate place, and it really was a natural amphitheater. All it needed was some smoothing out. A grandstand was built which extended from the Carnegie Inn to where Margaret Morrison is now located. But the Carnegie Inn wasnt 'the 
Carnegie Inn thenit was the field house and gymnasium. The ground 
oil which the house was built was formerly used for a dumping yard.
Ill bet plenty of old tin can be 
found in that ground now, and again he laughed. Looking out 
across the Cut I pictured Lieutenant Burton chasing a rabbit . . . 
And I laughed too.
Senior Girls 
Show Public 
Model Home
Spend Less Than $1500, 
Furnish And Equip 
Entire House
Seniors in the Department of 
Household Economics have fur
nished and entirely equipped a 
five-room house, keeping all expen
ditures within $1,500. For the past 
three weeks, Miss Harriet F. Gleudon, head of the department, and 
the students of the department, 
have spent considerable time in 
Pittsburgh department stores, pric
ing and selecting the most practic
al and economical equipment for a 
modern home.
The house, located on Sulgrave 
road in Chatham Village, will be open for inspection from 2 to 5 oclock every afternoon this week. It lias been lent to the Better Homes in America Association as a part of a demonstration of methods of reducing labor and expense in housekeeping, and to suggest 
ways of increasing the attractiveness of the home.Besides choosing the furnishings for the house, the students also chose the wallpaper in two of the bedrooms and decided on the location of various cupboards and shelves. The house is one of those which were built by the Buhl Foundation, and was just completed October 1.Furnishing the house is one of 
the problems of seniors in the home management course. A large 
part of the money spent was used in equipping the Kitchen and laundry, since housekeeping activities are mainty centered in these rooms. In seleoting the rest of the furni
ture, the students were guided by Miss Glendons conception of an ideal household which would be one 
in which artistic arrangement and efficient management go hand in hand.Last year the seniors in the department budgeted the cost of meals lor a family of five, attracting wide attention. Invitations to inspect the house have been issued 
to civic and social organizations of Pittsburgh.
Carnegie A.i.a.n. 
W ill Begin Drive
The Carnegie branch of the 
American Institute of Electrical 
Engineers is beginning an inten

hope of the officers of the organi
zation to have all students in the 
Department of Electrical Engineer
ing become members. The dues 
are $1.00 per year, payable to a 
representative of each class who 
has been appointed as member
ship chairman. The senior repre
sentative is Bartholomew J. 
Aimone; the junior, Carl W. Oettinger; the sophomore, James 
Lobach.
A well-known scientist, Dr. W. B. 
Kouwenhover, professor of electri

University, was the featured speaker of the A. I. E. E. meeting held Wednesday, October 19. He is the vice-president of the mideastern section of the national A. I. E. E. His speech to the students dealt with a comparatively new invention, the Sperry Locomotive, which is a device for locating defects in railroad rails by electrical means. According to Dr. Kouwenhover, current is sent through the portion of rail being tested, and a drop in potential locates a flaw in the material.Plans are being completed by the A. I. E. E. officers to hold another meeting in the near future.

Four students', Miles A. Kinley, W. Howard Sprenkle, William W. Justice, and Igor J. Karassick. all graduates of the Machanical Engineering Department of Carnegie, are doing post graduate work in the Aerodynamics Laboratory. They are experimenting with a three-inch model of an automobile in a water channel and hope by means of their
experiment to determine j'ust how the progress of a car is affected by its streamline. The car is electrically driven and the work consists of protographing the water currents surrounding the car while it is in motion. Their purpose is to perfect an ideal car whose shape will not greatly Interfere with its speed.
W,hat on earth are you up to now?

Eminent Engineers Interested In Experiments; 
Work Is Being Performed Under Supervision 
Of Mechanical Engineering Department
Four graduates of the Depart
ment of Mechanical Engineering 
last June, William W. Justice, 
Miles A. Kinley, W. Howard 
Sprenkle, and Igor J. Karassllc are 
at work in the Aerodynamics laboratory on an experiment in which they hope to discover the effect of the streamline design of an auto
mobile on its speed. They then plan to perfect a design whose streamline will not radically interfere with the speed of the car, the power consumption being reduced, they believe, by a streamline which cuts down wind resistance.
Most of the work is being done in a water channel in which a three-inch model of an automobile is propelled by electric power. The passage of the model through the 
water is recorded by photographing the positions of fine particles 
of Lycopodium powder which had
been sprinkled over the surface of the water. As it is possible to vary the speed of the model, experi
ments are being made on the effect of the resistance at various velocities. The distribution of the particles, caused by the passage of the model through them; is the important effect to be noted in this experiment. The speed of the. mo
del is recorded on a regulatory scale.Eminent engineers are closely watching these experiments, and 
the students have a tetter from a consulting engineer , of the Belgi
um Bureau of Technical Documents stating his interest in the experiment. The work is being performed under the supervision of Prof. Allen II. Blaisdell, Associate Professor of Aeronautical Engineering. 
The experiments will later be adapted to standardized automobiles.

THE CARNEGIE TARTAN, TUESDAY. OCTOBER 25. 1932
Ele
PLAID SPORTS 
SCREEN 

BY JOE BRONSON
PRE-SEASON REPORTS WHICH DRIFTED AROUND THE COUNTRY FROM OUT AT SOUTH BEND had it that Hunk Anderson was about to produce one of the greatest teams ever to run up and down the gridiron, but many fans said it was the same old ballyhoo; and when this same team trampled over its first two opponents the critics said that Its opposition was poor, but after Saturdays contest with the Tartans there are few Carnegie rooters who do not believe the preseason reports. Never in Carnegie's history has a Plaid squad encountered such a powerful team, and the players are not disheartened over the 42-0 defeat, but rather are they loud in their praise for their superior opponents. It was almost inhuman the way that Irish eleven ran off their plays. It looked more like a machine going into action than eleven individuals. The timing was good; the interference excellent, the blocking almost perfect; and the running of the backs phenomenal. Not only a few times did they click but on almost every play they went through their duties with clock like precision. That the Tartans were outplayed and outclassed is no secret, the players will tell you as much, but in spite of these odds the Plaid eleven did not fold up and quit; they were in there fighting every minute. That Notre Dame team earned every score they made, and when the final whistle blew they knew they had been in a football game. That Carnegie was handicapped with the loss of Ray Tesser and Co-captain Hooks Sample can not be doubted, but with these two men in the game it is doubtful if the score would have been materially different. The Notre Dame supply of reserves seemed almost unlimited; the second string men appeared to be as good as the first and the other subs as good as them. The six touchdowns were made by six different men; Murphy and Vejar being the only ones of the first eight backfield men who failed to score.Well, it is over with and will go down in the records as one of the worst defeats ever suffered by a Carnegie team, but to the present students and players it will stand for one thing, and that isa great Irish eleven.
TO SINGLE OUT INDIVIDUAL STARS IN SUCH A CONTEST IS VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE. The whole Notre Dame team played a whale of a game. Lulcats and Koken were very tricky runners while Banas and Melinkovich were almost unstopable in line plunges. Kurth and Krause, the giant Notre Dame tackles, were the proverbial immovable obstacles and it was seldom that they were out of a play when it came in their vicinity. Co-captain George Kavel, who played the entire contest, prevented scores several times by his excellent open field tackling. Red Jones, who played such a marvelous game against W. & J'., gave another fine exhibition of defensive play, and Siegal, who relieved him, ably held up his end of the game.
THE ONE BRIGHT FEATURE OF THE WHOLE AFTERNOON was the performance of the Kiltie band. The Kilties who are always a colorful group to watch put on a clever act between halves which brought them a generous cheer from the Notre Dame rooters. The act which was of particular interest was a large Notre Dame banner which was floated in the air with the aid of many gas filled balloons.
IT WAS A BAD DAY ALL AROUND FOR CARNEGIE TEAMS. The Cross Country squad journeyed all the way to South Bend only to come home decisively trounced by the Irish Harriers. Those boys from Indiana seem to have the Indian sign on us Pennsylvanians. The plebe football team went down to Morgantown and were thoroughly trimmed by the Mountaineer yearlings. This year's plebe team which is weaker than usual were at the short end of a 4G-6 score, and it is also the. first time the West Virginians have been able to turn the trick for four years. WellBetter Time Are Coming Bye and Byemaybe.
JOCK SUTHERLANDS GOLDEN PANTHER OF THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH met its first stumbling block of the year on Saturday afternoon. Pitt who had run roughshod over all its opponents to date found the Big Ten team, who had been previously defeated by Michigan and tied by Indiana, too strong defensively for them and had to be content with a 0-0 tie. It is going to be one sweet game over in the stadium this coming Saturday afternoon when Pitt and Notre Dame clash. Our vote goes to the Irish by at least two touchdowns.New York University, who were previously undefeated, found Andy Kerr's Colgate team too strong for them, and the former Wash-Jeff mentors outfit came off the field with a 14-0 victory.It looks as if Michigan is going to be the Big Ten champions this year. As yet the Wolverines have to taste defeat and the toughest part of their schedule Is behind them. Purdue is almost out of the running because of their 7-7 tie with Northwestern.Southern California continued their victorious march by trimming the favored Stanford team 13-0. Pop Warner's Cardinals were the favorite but the underdog came through in fine fashion and are now headed toward the Pacific coast championship.
THE TARTAN FOOTBALLERS HAVE LITTLE CHANCE FOR A MUCH NEEDED REST, because this week they go to Philadelphia to moot tho undefeated Temple Owls on Friday night. Temple got off to a alow start, but in tho last two games have been stepping right along, and just about this Friday night they are going to be a tough nut to 
rack. Temple, so far this year boasts of victories over Thiel, West /irginia, Bucknell, and Denver University. The Cherry and White oam has a strong line and a fast backfield and they expect to take the artans. In each of tho two meetings on the gridiron with Temple the 'ails have emerged victorious. Last year the Skibos administered Owls their only defeat. The score was 19-13. Two years ago ill Eyth, and John Karcis led tlie> way to a 32-13 victory. This Temple is out for revenge, so we can look for a hard fought game.
ERY MEAGER CROWD WANDERED OVER TO THE GYMNAA ON SATURDAY to witness the football game on the Grid-Graph. of those few who were there, most of them left during the third :er. However, a few loyal Skibo followers stayed until the end, .hey are to be congratulated for their spirit. The Mortar Board tiicipation of a holiday crowd had a regular refreshment stand set it most of the ice cream, candy, doughnuts, and cider were coni by the members. However, they managed to sell the keg of to a certain Forbes street fraternity who are contemplating a mas party.

Plebes To Report 
For Cross-Counlry
All Freshmen who are interested in trying out for the Cross-country team should do 
so immediately and report to Coach Guy Halferty in the Gymnasium. Very few men 
have reported so far for this sport and there is an excellent chance for new men to make the 
team. There are five meets to be run off which means that there will be ample opportu
nity for new candidates to get a fair trial.

Basketball is 
On Upswing
Last Two Years are 
Most Successful 
for Tartans
Although the Tartan basketball team of last year gained national 
prominence, and the one of the year before set up a successful record, the history of the Carnegie 
floor team reveals that Plaid quintets have not always had a smooth path to travel, but on the contrary 
the records reveal that for several seasons the Tartans had to fight hard to find a factory out of the jumpled heap of defeats.
The first records of a Carnegie basketball team are back in 1907 
when the team won five games and lost five, and of the victories, one 
was over Pitt to the tune of a 32- 22 score.
In 1926 the team established the best record it had ever made until that time by copping 15 victories against 10 defeats. Although the 
quintet of 1927 did mat establish as good a record it recorded two vic
tories over strong foes. The one was a last minute triumph gained over Pitt, and the other was a hardearned victory over City College of New York on the New Yorkers home floor. This was the first game the hoys from the City College of New York had lost in Several years on their home court.
The years of 192S, 1929 and 1930 were dismal ones for the Skibos. In these three years the teams could gather only six victories and 
in one of the years the team went through the season without a win.The second year of coaching by 
Buzz Hogan brought with it a new era of basketball to Cainegie. By that time his system was fairly established and a team composed mostly of sophomores went out to cop 11 victories against seven defeats. Last year the team literally burned up their opponents by winning IS games out of a tough 25 game schedule.
Last year's team boasted of victories over Duquesne, W. & J., University of Chicago, Yale, Princeton, Temple, New York University, Buffalo and several others. The prospects for this years team are even better than last year, andwhen the basketball season opens 
up watch the Tartans go.

A great Notre Dame machine 
that radiated unauencliable rays of power and punishment had little 
difficulty in handing Carnegie the most crushing defeat in the latters gridiron history by amassing 42 points to none for Tech. The Irish used only the most orthodox of plays, depending upon their superior blocking and tackling for the victory. The same Tartan team that held Notre Dame 19-0 last year, fought hard out there in Soutli Bendmake no mistake about thatbut simply could not cope with the superior brand of football produced at the famous Indiana institution.Carnegies only scoring chance came early and suddenly in the 
game and for a few short moments Tartan rooters had visions of another memorial upset. On the first 
play following the kickoff, ICokens attempt to pass was smothered by the Plaid forwards and when the pile was untangled Carnegie had possession of the ball 11 short yards from the goal line. But Notre Dame quickly rendered the Tartan running attack helpless and, as a last resort, a pass was attempted which also failed.From this point on, the Scotch warriors were decidedly on the defensive. After a preliminary exchange of punts Mike Koken set sail from his own 47-yard line and, behind perfect interference, negotiated the necessary yardage for the initial touchdown.
The second quarter, with the Irish first-stringers in the game, 
was the most disastrous from a Skibo standpoint. Three 7-pointers were registered in this period; the first two coming as the result of concerted drives and the last after a beautiful 60-yard touchdown runback of a Tartan punt by Jaskwich.In the period following the intermission Notre Dame gained possession of the ball via fumble route 
in Carnegie territory and drove it over the goal line on a series of short but successful advances. The last tally was due largely to a 20-yard pass which ended up on the Tartan 10-yard mark. From this point Lukats, Koken and Banas each carried the ball with the lastnamed going over for the counter.The loss of co-Captain Sample, wh,o was unable to play because of an injured leg, was keenly felt once the Notre Dame offense got under way. Hooks is a power on the defense and his absence materially weakened that important department. And the leadership qualities of Kavel, Carnegies other captain, were never more clearly shown than in the Irish encounter. 
George bore the brunt of the Plaid attack, was unusually busy defensively with Notre Dame runners who spent most of their time in the Skibo secondary, and in general set a wonderful example of play for his teammates to follow.The present humiliation which Notre Dame has forced on Carnegie leaves the Tartans in about the same position with respect to the Irish that existed after the game in 1925. In that year the South Benders mopped up the field with the Skibos and it was the burning desire for revenge more than anything else which carried Carnegie to that famous 19-0 victory the following year.
Grid-Graph For
Temple Game
Graduate Manager Overend 
wishes it to be announced that the Grid-Graph will be in operation for the Temple game this Friday night. For the past two 
years the Tartans have given an excellent account of themselves against Temple, and this years game is expected to be interesting. There will be no charges for students; as they will be admitted on their student book. The admission for outsiders will be twenty-five cents.
Cinder Stars 
Break Many 
Track Marks
Revived School Interest 
In Running Teams 
Shown Lately
In the last few years, the Tartan 
Track men have assaulted the 
school records with such vigor 
that, of the seventeen listed rec
ords, eight have been broken and two tied. Captain Tom Coulter lead the onslaught with four records to his credit. Coach Halfertys record, which had been standing about twenty long years, was among those to fall. Incidentally, that Tartan runner who has been holding on to that half-mile record' since 1914 had better look to his laurels. Last year, in a meet with the Pitt Frosh, fleet-footed Roger Burke battled to a win and tied that aged record.
These record-breaking acliievemens have placed the teams of the last few years on a par with those of a decade ago. A decline of school interest caused the Carnegie track fortunes to take a drop about, five years ago, previous to that the Tartans always had one of

Plaid Hopes To Stop 
Unbeaten Veteran 
Owl Team
The Hoot Owl and the old Hootmon clash athletically as well as 
verbally this Friday night when 
Carnegies Big Red team invades 
Philadelphia to meet the unbeaten 
Temple machine. The contest will 
mark the Tartans first appearance 
under the mazdas and as Carnegie 
is a favorite in the Carnegie 
City, in view of the thrilling Car
negie Temple clashes of the past, 
a large turnout is expected.
The Owls have yet to taste the 
sting of defeat this season. Their 
inaugural contest -with Thiel 
proved little more than a warm-up 
as the 31-0 score would indicate. The following week however, was a different story and it was only after the hardest kind of a game that they were able to emerge victorious over West Virginia by a 14-13 count. Temple's winning ways continued against Bucknell to. the tune of 12-0 and last Friday Denver University journeyed all the way to Philadelphia to take a 14-0 lacing.Temple first appeared on Car
negies schedule in 1930 and has been a fixture ever since. In that inaugural contest the Owls flashed unexpected strength and it was due largely to the individual efforts of Dutch Eyth that the Plaid was able to come off with a 32-13 win. Last year Temple was even stronger and the Skibos were quite satisfied with a 19-13 victory in a game that seldom found the spectators in 
their seats.This years Owl squad is built around Len Wliittock its captain and one of the most capable quar terbacks in the East. Whittok was the largest thorn in Carnegies side during the two games played and will be the man the Tartans have to stop Friday night. Eddie Zulcas, Aesta and Regan round out the Temple attack and combine with a veteran line to give Philadelphia fans a truly formidable outfit.
 Temples rise in Eastern football circles has been as short as it has been spectacular. Only a few short years ago the Owls were considered the easiest kind of a set-up while now the name teams of the East are very careful about playing Temple. A large portion of the credit, for Temples present 
impressive football status is due Coach Heinie Miller who has carefully and capably welded a great combine out of the raw material at hand.
In light of these facts, Carnegie will enter Fridays game practically on even terms with their oppon
ents and a Temple victory will be far from an upset. Tartan warriors who have played against Temple have the utmost respect for the latters gridiron prowess and sport fans who have seen the 
previous Carnegie-Temple clashes are anticipating another great one.
the strongest teams in the district, and on several occasions won national honors. Track is now regaining its lost prestige for we find that while the teams during 1927-29 could only corner three vic
tories in twelve starts, during the last two years we have won ten victories in fifteen meets.The Cross Countiy men smashed all existing records last year and replaced them with new ones. The varsity course record belongs to last years captain, .Tess Price, Roger Burke was again spurred to record-breaking achievements when he won over the Pitt Frosh, and 
set a new record for the Freshman course.
The high spot of the season was a decisive victory over Pitt in which three Tartans tied for first. Only the rugged West Virginians and the debonair New Yorkers were able to eke out victories over the Plaid in five starts. Cross Country also saw lean years but 
the teams of the last few years have been up in there. For the 
greatest harrier to ever wear the Plaid we point to Howdy Dykeman, of a decade ago, who placed second in the inter-collegiate championships one year. He also holds two track records which will be hard to touch.

The action of the Student Couucil in setting aside a large portion of the W. A. As funds for the erection of an outing cabin is appreciated by every member of the association. The surplus will draw sufficient interest in the next five years to enable the actual construction to be started in a not too distant future. It is hoped that 
the present freshman class, at least, will enjoy a season of outings there before their graduation. We take this opportunity to thank the Student Council in behalf Of the Association for their help in initiating such a worthy project.Although a complete account of the social aspect of W. A. A's swimming party appeared in last weeks gossip column, we feel that it is not too late to give the affair a brief resume. Several races not featured on the program offered considerable amusement to the spectators. Ask Mitzie Gray to tell you about them. We suggest

Crippled Yearlings No 
Match For Big Blue 
Machine
An unusually powerful West Vir
ginia Freshman squad crushed the 
Carnegie Plebes under a 45-6 score 
last Saturday at Morgantown. Led 
by Canton, a shifty running half
back, the Mountaineers rolled up 
seven touchdowns on Coach Armentrouts crippled squad.
In the first half the lads from the 
hill district piled up 26 points be
fore the Carnegie team could get 
started. Near the end of the first 
half, however, the Skibos started 
an offnsive of their own and scored 
quickly on a series of passes by 
Spisak to Bowser and Sanford, 
which placed the oval on the West 
Virginia five yard stripe. A pass 
to Lenz put the ball' over for a 
touchdown.
The little Tartans held the 
mountaineer aggregation even in 
the third period, but in the finale 
the West Virginia machine again 
got going and countered three 
times.Carnegies yearlings will strive to break their losing streak this Saturday when they encounter Kiski at Saltsburg. Kiski has also found the going a bit rough this season, having lost to Navy and Wash-Jeff, but they are always a battle for any team. W. and J. will bring their strong squad to Pittsburgh the following week to engage the Plebes in the Carnegie Bowl. The Proxies defeated Kiski 10-0 Saturday.
another swimming party next semester. By that time the deep sea lions who were searching for coins may have developed sufficient wind to keep them dowu until they can find the treasure. By the way why dont the upperclassmen evei dash over to the pool and take a plunge after classes? There is nothing that peps you up more than a cool dip after a stuffy quiz. We all need it.Rifle season is set to open witli 
a loud bang. Leat Vagritey, the man ager, is making plans for a huge turnout on the part of the Freshmen. Remember that all upperclassmen are welcome to try out, even if they have failed to do so in the past few years. Instructors classes will be held in the Gym before any attempt is made to storm the range. Awards are made each year to the high-scorers by the Mens Rifle Team. The awards are worth working for, so get busy and shoot away.____________

The Tartan Harriers journeyed 
to South Bend last Saturday only 
to receive a decisive beating by the 
Irish 18-37. The Notre Damers 
gained five of the first six places, 
Bob Schell breaking the string by taking third place for Tech. Burke, Allan, Giolma, and Stanlcey took the next four places in that order The Irish proved too tough an assignment for the Tartans in the1 first meet of the year. In spite o. (lie loss of their three best men of last years team, including Wilson who made good on the Olympic 
Team last summer, Notre Dame gathered together enough good men to soundly trounce tho Tartans. Next Saturday the Tartan Tliinlies meet Geneva in Schenley Park and there are hopes that with the added training and experience they may be able to chalk up a victory for the Plaid.

Balanced meals, adequate exercte and at least eight hours of slei each night will fortify the stude against colds.
According to Dr. Esquerre, 1 resistance of the human mach is most important.

Yes sir, that handbook which we received at registration time sure is a knockout. It's got everything in it from fish to soup and backwards. Anything you dont want to know about is answered by simply looking at the index and then 
urning to page x-y/.. My hat is iff to the editor of so complete a vork of art. The cover is done up n fine style and the contrasting shades of green show that he knows his color chart, or should I say spectrum? Let the art students 
or some of those P. So D.s answer.
And, speaking of art students, 
here must be a great game going on about the lockers and their combinations. I wonder if it isnt 
made that way so that the students meet each other. Take in the two schools, why wo hardly 
know each other and they seem to be well acquainted over there, especially if you happen to be walkng down through the cave in the lower floor of the Arts Building adjacent to these small pill boxes 
known as telephone booths. Or maybe this is only one of their diversionsi wonder.
I thought l nau a corner on the parking question but I seem to 
have lost out. Some one seems to nave gotten next to a lot of dos and donts and published them in a concise form just to confuse the poor night student. Really though, the 
parking question is one of more ban passing interest. Its a pertexing one if you have a car, and 
. complexed one if you dont have one. I say complexed one especially when you have an arrangement with some one who has a car to ride you back and forth to school jnly to find out that your place has heen taken by some fair one over : in that congenial arts building who happens to live In an altogether different part of the country and you have to perambulate home as best you can.
Glad to note that the size of class does not have any bearing on the success of the class or the amount of time which can be consumed in studying because if it did, ->uld be out of luck. My classes 
'I small this year and I was to the point of wondering I would do if I was on trying to shirk one too many assignments stweek. They sure were 
, especially after such od of rest between the cer last year, and the semester this year. But then e are the things which go to make up the life of a night student,, episodes o,r something like them.1 see that we dont have a monopoly on all tilings a la night. The day school for the first time is going nighy to play Temple in Phil
adelphia. 'Hope they can see the goal post.) Sure must bo a sensa
tion to Wake up in the middle of the night, to find that you are attending day school in order to witness a night game. We poor night students will bo deprived of the pleasuro of seeing our team vanquish Tomple next Friday night in 
Philadelphia. Pily the band cant go with them, as I am sure that the Philadelphians would imagine the Kilties were parading 
around in their grass skirts, Hawaiian you know, because it would be difficult to distinguish the Plaid in the dark.
A clipping from a daily paper records that at Allegheny College there is a movement under way to encourage alumni to return for 'more education. Now I thought after a student graduated he finished, there just wasn't anything more for him to learn, if'there was more things to learn why graduate a fellow. At all events the students are returning for instruction which is given without charge. 
Gee that is something especially when tuition is so hard to find. It isn't every college that would do such a thing.
And now we come to taxes and . taxation. I read that they are try
ing to work up a scheme whereby everyone will come under that old adage, you cant dodge taxes and death. The latter is true, but I know some who manage to dodge the taxi collector. Why they are even thinking of taxing the air you breathe, the English you speakj the thoughts you have, the color of your eyes, the texture of your hair, in fact there isnt anything the tax makers havent thought of. They are simply tax mad. Wonder 
where they will stop.
Talking of dodging, I am simply going to dodge some one Saturday

Two Students 
Conduct Wind 
Tunnel Study
Graduates Investigate 
Calibration Of New 
Equipment
P. B. Stulen and H. N. Meixner, graduate students in Mechanical Engineering Department, are conducting an investigation in the Carnegie wind tunnel with the purpose of calibrating and standardizing this comparatively new equipment.Air-flow conditions in the test section are being carefully determined with respect to velocity and static pressure distribution as well as angularity, and a measure of turbalance in the stream. An interesting comparative study of means for determining angularity in the stream has been made. 
Model airfoils and airplanes are under test in order to ascertain their general characteristics, so that data might be comparable 
with that obtained in other laboratories throughout the world. The N. A. C. A. has instituted a program for the purpose of aligning or standardizing the results ob
tained for specified airfoils in various tunnels. The work done sliere is intended to fall in line with this standardization.The.wind tunnel here is of the Gottingen single return duct type. The energy imparted to the air is thus conserved by restricting it to a closed path. Irregularities in the air stream are reduced by cascades in the four corners of the path, and minimized by restricted area at the entrance nozzle. The balance system used here is of the ballistic type. In this system the model is suspended by wires from an overhead platform mounted on direct reading scales. For drag determination, the model is arranged to swing down stream until the moment of the weight plus the vertical component of the air force balance the moment of the horizontal component. The displacement of the model is measured by means of a sliding telescope mounted at the side of the tunnel, and the horizontal force 
computed.A study of distribution of pressure on various shaped cross-sections in wind streams is being made by William O. Clinedinst, senior aeronautical engineer. The models are cylinders of various shaped sections with small orifices located on the surface which are connected to multiple manometer sets. The results obtained from such tests are not beneficial to aeronautics alone, but are of value in the design of buildings and smoke stacks as the pressure caused on such structures by winds is an important factor in the design of such structures.
Guild Proceeds Used 
For Needy Families
The proceeds of the annual Guild mmbership which closed October 
5 will be used to buy shoes and blankets for needy famlies. No definite arrangements have been made as yet, but Mrs. Mary C. Burnett, head of the Department of Social Work will meet with the Guild members to make the neces
sary plans.Previously the Guild has furnished a room in the Kingsley House, a local settlement house; supplied milk to destitute families; given 
Christmas gifts to poor children; and contributed to other worthy 
causes.
An educational innovation, the basis of which will be taking mo* tion pictures for classroom work, has been announced by Dr. Robert Maynard Hutchins, president of the University of Chicago.
Production will begin shortly at the university on a. series of 20 talkies on the physical sciences. Next fall they will be tried out on the members . of the freshman class.Lectures by noted professors will be synchronized with the films, which can be repeated as often as necessary to bring home thq lesson to the student.

Night Arts To 
Hold Election 
On October 28
Room 308 to be Scene of 
Voting As Students 
Select Officers
Election of officers for the Night 
College of Fine Arts is to be held 
in room 308 on Friday night, Octo
ber 28, at 10 oclock.
The positions of president, vice 
president, secretary and treasurer 
for the present school year are to 
be filled by the election. All stu
dents should be sufficiently inter
ested to see that capable.men are 
elected to these offices that they will be sure to cast their ballots at this election. The men who are finally elected are to represent the Night College of Fine Arts on the Night Student Council. These officers, together with the balance of the Council, are directly responsible for all night student activities that are non-athletic in nature. They represent the students in all matters of night student welfare, 
and act as a liason between the night student body and the administrative faculty.The Night Student Council' has 
established several requirements which a student is expected to ful
fill before he is eligible for office. The most important of these are: the student must have had two full years previous registration (these need not be all in the same college, or consecutively); that he has paid the Night Student Council activity fee, and registered in the particular college at the time he seeks election; and that he has taken part in the activities of the Night Student Council for at least one year previous to election, and that his work has been recognized by the Council. These requirements of course apply to all colleges. In order to avoid confusion and save time, make sure that your candidates fill all these requirements before they are nominated. Students not having the above qualifications cannot hold office, and are not qualified for nomination.
Night Arts students are cautioned to be sure to have their registration card with them to gain admittance on Friday evening, October 28, at the election which will be held in room 308 at 10 oclock.

Thats right, try to keep us out.THAT one of our better known night stew-dents was caught red-handed Escorting some visitors through the Arts school the other night. Who 
was the fair one, kind sir?THAT another one, a chiseler, by the way, got his name on page 1 of the Tartan last week.THAT, notwithstanding Councils ruling on the word., the Engineers still spell nightnite. Look at the political calling card. This comes from our school which boasts of the brainiest men on the campus.THAT someone in the inner circle wants to know who pens this stuff. Its a dark secret, yowsah!THAT in spite of his penchant for plain and fancy loafing, the Idle Night Student manages to get around quite a bit.THAT one secret to success is, Keep your ears and eyes open and your mouth shut.THAT some people can squack louder and longer than anybody else and accomplish exactly nothing.THAT thats that, and Ill be seenya.
Statue Of Venus 
Furnishes P. & D.s 
Fine Rendezvous
The opinion is general among 
night P. and D. students, that the 
most popular meeting place in the 
Arts school is at the statue of 
Venus de Milo. Every night so 
many students gather to sit at her 
base that one is almost led to believe that this plaster statue must surely possess some occult influence to attract such veneration. One is hardly conscious of her irresistible charms.To pass her without casting an affectionate glance at her, as she stands in her niche with all the beauty and feminine dignity which her Grecian sculptor gave her, is to suppress a natural instinct. If she were to tell that she has heard during her existence here, her sen
sational disclosures would probably send Walter Winchell into oblivion. Here friendships are encouraged, laughter rings, troubles are aired, dates are made, and gossip is heard. Drawing night stu-1 dents together to find solace in friendly tete a tetes as she does, she has become quite unconsciously popular.
Young ladies have been observed admiring the Grecian beauty of this great lady of perennial youth, but it is not known whether they also admire her generous proportions. The other night a lovely young lady was seen sitting at its base and leaning affectionately against the statue, apparently in sweet slumber. To the average student this was probably a very prosaic and banal sight, but to this finely touched one, it perhaps served as the meeting between the two great beauties of mythical lore, the Venus of Aphrodite, fictionized by Anstey as the Tinted Venus, and the Venus de Milo.
Night Architects Busy 
Preparing For Charette
Night students in the department of Architecture are preparing for their first charette of the year, which will take place next week. This initial baptism under fire will show to some extent what the night architects are able to accomplish. The present problem is an interesting one, and a glance at some of the .preliminary work being done 
by the night students reveals some good solutions. The night architects have been assigned one section of the large drafting, room for the first time. This segregation should work to their advantage, as the troublesome moving around of previous years is entirely eliminated.
Preparation Of Tartan 
Mailing List Under Way
The mailing list of the Tartan is undergoing its annual revision which is always necessary at this time. The first issues of the weekly have been mailed out as far as possible to all the names which have been reached up to this time. It is a very difficult taskto list all the names because of omissions, illegible writing and printing, and incorrect information, but the staff is doing all it can to bring the list up to date with as much dispatch as possible.
Call Issued For Night 
Student Puppet Staff
The night sales staff for Carnegie Tech Puppet is being organized 
and those night students who are interested in working for the special insignia which is awarded by Puppet should send in their names and addresses as soon as possible to E. E. McDonald, Box 137, C. I. T. Post Office, or call at the Night Student Council Office, Room 144-C, Industries Building.

Night Ind. To 
Hold Smoker 
Saturday Eve.
Frolic Will Be Held In 
Gymnasium With Many 
Novel Features
The Night College of Industries 
is getting ready for its semi-annual 
smoker which will be held on Sat
urday evening, October 29, start
ing at 8:30 p. m. The mens gym
nasium will be used for the affair 
which is free for night industries 
men. The smokers given by the 
Night College of Industries have 
always been big affairs and this 
years smoker will be as big as 
ever as the same effort is being 
made by those in charge to give 
the night men the very best enter
tainment possible during the even
ing.
Talking movies are listed on the 
program together with other novel 
features. The all important box
ing bouts, wiiich are always a feature of the Night College of Indus* tries Smokers, have not been neglected and several contests have been arranged.Our famous Kiltie Band has promised to furnish us with the music for the evening, and we are always glad to have them with us. They are now in the pink of condition, having rehearsed constantly for the past several weeks.A free lunch is the order of the 
evening, and when Industries does something, they do it :n a big way. Sandwiches,, with all the trimmings and something to drink, not what you are thinking, will be served. And then smokes, well this will be a diversion and there will be plenty of the weed to go around so that every one in attendance can enjoy a puff or two.The preparation for the affair will be made during the afternoon, and all those workers who are interested in putting the affair over in good order are requested to be out by 2:30 p. m. in order to make preparations.
This is a Night College of Industries affair and consequently open 
to the night students of this college only. The admittance will therefore be through a night industries registration card, so be sure to have your registration card with you in order that you will be assured of admittance, as those who do not have their card will have to be refused entrance.

While Carnegie has been very 
fortunate in its tussle w?ith the de
pression during the past period, 
the failure of conditions to improve 
lias made it quite necessary to map 
out an econom3r program for the 
college that will enable it to con
tinue its program without calling 
upon the students to carry the load 
in the form of increased tuition, 
higher fees, and so forth. The de
sire of the administration to keep 
the tuition fees at their present 
low level, in spite of prevailing con
ditions, should be appreciated by 
the student body to a fitting ex
tent. Naturally, we are referring 
solely to the night school.
The student, while probably ap
preciating the advantages offered 
in low tuition rates, possibly does 
not realize that part of the respon
sibility of carrying on rests upon 
him. All of us can do a little to
wards keeping down costs in the 
departments in which we are reg
istered, by practicing carefulness 
with supplies and equipment, by 
avoiding inexcusable waste, and by 
carefully considering just what he 
intends to do before beginning any work that makes the use of materials an item of cost, no matter how inconsiderable it may seem at the time.Many, if not all, of the various departments have requested that the students practice as much care as possible, in an effort to keep down operating costs, and it is the 
least we can do to heed this request, if for no other reason than to show our appreciation of the square deal that Carnegie has al
ways given us.It isnt merely a matter of school spirit, or any other overworked principle. It is something of the duty of any gentleman to act in. such a way as to benefit the majority of his associates, and this can be done best in our cases by practicing economy in the matter of supplies and equipment, especially those supplied as part of the course, and for which no additional fee is charged.

Select Your Candidate With Care
\ Tomorrow at 9 :30 all students in classes at that time will 
lie asked to vote for the man whom they favor for the next 
'jresidentlof the United States. At this same time, the faculty 
members and administrative personnel will also indicate their 
choices.
For the past several months, all three of the most import
ant candidates have been expounding their theories of govern
mental activity, assailing one another from all possible angles, 
and ballyhooing the cause of their parties so much that the 
person with but a mite of interest should have a general idea on 
what grounds the candidates base their assumptions. In a time 
of depression, of course, it is of extreme importance that the 
voters know the character and ability of the candidatesprob
ably one of the most important things to consider in the present 
campaign, since the Republican and Democratic platforms vary 
little in principleand. their past accomplishments and sus
ceptibility to the political bosss mandates.
So much downright defamation and unsportsmanlike mudslinging has appeared in print and has been spoken by the can
didates henchmen that it is hard to really know the true capac
ities and abilities of the men without much study. Some say 
there is little difference between the Republican and Democratic 
candidates and their platforms; others can point out many 
differences, especially between the two candidates. The So
cialist candidate and platform both, differ from those of the 
other two parties. These degrees of difference and their signi
ficance the voter should know, and lie should vote for the can
didate who stands for the tilings that are fundamentally sound 
not for the candidate who talks about airy nothings, making 
them appear as serious issues, or the one who promises impossi
ble and impractical things. The voter should not be SAvejDt from 
his feet by the torrents of polished oratory.
As deplorable as the situation may be, it is nevertheless 
true that the great majority of voterswhich are really a very 
small percentage of the peoplemake their choice yn some one 
or two issues \yhich are sometimes* relatively unimportant, or. 
because of some personal characteristic of the candidate, rather 
than 011 sound reason after careful consideration of the candi
dates, their abilities, and what they stand for.
Tliere has been no other time in the history of the United 
States when it has been so important to choose a man and a 
party that can help to lead the country out of the present 
economic upheaval.
Hats Off' To The Kilties
Carnegie's spirited Kilties again brought honorto their 
Alma Mater at the Notre Dame-Carnegie football game at South 
Bend last Saturday by their, novel display during the half pe
riod. A. most unusual stunt which saw two crepe paper ban
ners, each 30 feet long and five feet wide, being carried skyward 
by colored balloons during th N.D. letter formation, thrill
ed the 30,000 fans assembled for the game. The band boys re
ceived one ol: the greatest ovations they have ever received. 
Jess Harper, athletic director at Notre Dame, acclaimed the 
Carnegie Kilties one of the 'best college bands he has ever 
heard.
It is a shame that the student body as a whole does not 
have as much school spirit as the hard working Kilties have.

Explains Rise 
Of44 Auturchy 
Failure Of Major Forms 
Of Govt. Seen Since 
World War
FROM ^H4E FE 4eE
(Continued From Page Two) too far one way, the holocaust and 
the dogs of war are loose again.Germany, vexed, desperate and insulted by the imposition of the 
war guilt on her shoulders turns to embrace a {mad, adventurous, militaristic party led by a new man on horseback. Adolf Hitler. 
Nor can one be surprised at this. She has to carry an enormous burden of war debt which will have to 
be paid by generations who had nothing to do with the war and she is not allowed, i moreover, to pay her debts in goods (the only way it 
can be done), because the United States and other creditors refuse to take her goods. Therefore, what she has paid already has been by 
borrowing: she has since the war paid over three billion dollars by borrowing four billions chiefly from the very countries she is destined to pay. As the very core of Europe, we find Germany therefore sitting on a powder-keg with a revolution toward the right (con
servative, militaristic and perhaps monarchistic) or one toward the left (communistic) hardly .to be avoided.
France, more bellicose and nationalistic than ever sits as th supreme protector of the crazy pattern of post-Europe as constructed by the treaty of Versailles, an unstable equilibrium if there ever was one. Not having felt the pinch of the world-wide depression until recently, her haughty position has not been threatened. But within her 
boundaries that terrible scourage the balance of power teeterS over of capitalism, unemployment is beginning to rear its head, and French domination of the continent due largely to her swollen gold-resources is being threatened.England lias plunged into the tariff experiment under the aegis 
of a so called national government composedof the representatives of all the different parties which is now however cracking visibly, what with daily riots of the dole-ers on the streets of London.Italy is restless under the iron heel of the black dictatorship of Il Duce. Its economic position is none to brilliant and the adventurous thirst for the glory of the Fascists can hardly be kept in check.
To the East rises the giant colossus of Soviet Russia straining in the midst of heroic efforts to build up a vast new economic system. But even Russia is hard-hit by the 
worlcl-wide depression in its efforts to build the most gigantic econom
ic machine of the world. Within the country there is widespread distress in so far, at least, as the basic necessities of life are concoucerned. The political squabbles within the ranks of the ruling party rear up, and Stalin periodically 
cashiers or demotes those opposed to his ideas. Still as a hope and as % promise, Russia (perhaps unwillingly) to day stands as a revolutionary impetus to the rest of Europe. One thing is certainpar
liamentary and democratic government has failed in Europe since the war.What of all this shall the American voter retain to guide him in casting his ballot this NovembeV? 
How to extricate ones own views from this welter of hectic politics and absurd economics which has engulfed Europe? It is, of course, difficult to render these European issues clear and find their bearings upon our situation without considerable study and discussion. It is certainly a pity that our peanut politicians, and sensational, small
time newspapers are allowed to keep us smug in our innocence an'd provincialism.
Teacher Writes 
Book On Home
Miss Mabel Thrilling, professor 
of Home Economics Education, in 
Margaret Morrison College, is the 
author of the book, The Girl and Her Home. This book is published under the Riverside Home Economics Series and was written 
in collaboration with Miss Florence W. Nicholas, a prominent authority in that field.
The book is divided into seven units, each of which takes up some phase of home life, such as home management; household finances, care of children, health, and the use of leisure time. There are also a number of tables, photographs and plans included in the book.
At the present time, the book is now being used as a text book in the Teacher Training course. It is intended for use in senior high schools.
Aged Tool Mart Dies 
In Machine Shop Oct. 17
Charles McTaggart, in charge of tool distribution in the machine shop, collapsed at his desk last Monday evening, October 17., and died a short time later. Mr. McTaggart, who op as seventy years old, resided at 711 Trenton Avenue, Wilkinsburg and has 
been in charge of the distribution of tools for the past eight years. The coroners verdict was that dei was due to a heart atThree types of men go to col
lege; those who are willing to be 
educated, those : who want to be 
educated, and those who are de
termined to be educated., said 
Newton D. Baker in a recent ar
ticle written for the Princetonian.
In accord with an announcement last year that the university would accept produce from Illinois farmers as tuition and that they would pay 10 per cent above the market price, a student at Illinois Wesleyan University paid his tuition with 40 sacks of potatoes.
Carnegie Graduates 
Represented In Exhibit
Recent graduates of the Department of Painting and Decorating at Carnegie are to be prominently 
represented in an exhibition of student work in Graphic Arts which , the American Federation of Arts in Washington is planning to send to various cities throughout the country. This exhibit, which is being selected from four or five 
of the more important art schools, includes block prints and lithographs. Robert B. Green '31 and Sterling B. Smeltzer 31 are showing block prints made while they were seniors. Orval Kipp 32, John Scherrer 32, Elizabeth A. Phillips 32, and Lillian R. Loevner 32 are to be represented by a variety of their recent efforts.
ELECTIONS AND HOW
Election day, campaign speeches, polls of all kinds, political arguments, debts, tariffs and what not all look sick when they start campaigning in 
the Art School. Last Tuesdays freshman election evoked what bids fair to go down in the annuals of Carnegie as the most sensational bit of campaigning in the history of the institution.
Things started very slowly with only a few scattered votes coming in during the first hour and to a casual observer the whole thing looked like just another election.
Then like a thunderbolt from on high, an avalanche, the P. & D. Department descended into the main foyer to the strains of martial music.After making the rounds of the hall things began in earnest. Forming a semi - circle around the niche directly behind the polls a wellplanned program of speeches, hula hulas, songs and cheers was executed in true Bohemian style.
This well mapped campaign so swayed the attendant populi that the painters candidate came from behind witli a rush and knotted the count in the final seconds of the fray, necessitating a repetition of the whole affair again today.
The entire demonstration was so vociferous that an innocent bystander might well have thought it was a demonstration for Bocardi instead of Bernardi.* * " * * *
HERE AND THERELastFriday the first broadside was fired in what should prove a most interesting sorority rushing season. The Beta Pis, Alpha Kapps, TriGamms, and Beta Tau Lambdas each had a cor-, uer. The tea was a big success and things are now officially on.Oh, yes! theres that little freshman Drama sty dent that kicked a hole through one of the cellar windows in Birch Hall on her way home from the football dance Saturday.
Those optimistic boys that are wearing the 1940 numerals around decided to start practicing on cutting out fives since that C-4 quiz on Friday.The Beta boys received a mysterious phone call the other day and now have a. five dollar check for the mysterious person that called. See the Military Ball issue of Puppet for details.Speaking of the Puppet brings to mind Editor Lazarus and his spur of the moment trip to South Bend with Karges and two others. The four of them were playing bridge at the D. U. Lodge Friday night when the inspiration dawned. They set out in Bills coupe (without the aid of! rumble seat) and never slept a wink till they returned Siinday.Seen at the Wm Penns new, gorgeously decorated Chatterbox on the opening melee last Wednesday:Joseph Urban, the designer, Mr. Epply, Skin Young, the swellish tenor, and many Pittsburghs notables including Debutante Childs, boy oh boy, Johnny Hamps rhythm boys . . . From th cam
pus, Sarah Davis, Peggy Niedringhause, Sarabel Browarsky, Mary Davis, Bill Lazarus and several others. And was it packed? Some place.Prof. Leeds predicts that there is a possibility of some of this years graduating class getting jobs.The Tau Delta Phi boys have changed their place of-residence to Woodmont street this year. Getting exclusive, wed say.* * * * *
THAT DANCE AGAINFive young ladies who weekly attend the football dances, pardon me, who attend the football dances weekly, have just formed a new club. Although a name has not been selected as yet they are at present known as the forgotten women. Max Piekarski, Olive Roberts, Gloria Kloos, Sally Davis, and Becky Linn are the present members. They have devised an entirely different method of selecting their president. They have a revolving system, with the most forgotten woman being awarded the laurels each week.
Thi3 weeks football dance saw the regular parade of campus notables which always attends these functions on hand once again. Johnny Ladd and Betty Graham, Nancy Henderson and Jimmy Fergus, Georgetta Taylor and Dick Campfield were on hand once more. Jimmy Leonard certainly was enjoying his work in the check room, yessir every minute of it. Next week Billy Weixel comes back and so do the football men than can still walk. Look for the swell new red, white and blue posters advertising the event. Something smart and snappy, and how !
HOME FANS
Only a few students -were brave enough Ho thumb tlieir nose at old man depression and make' the semi-annual jaunt to South Bend. Those who stayed behind were well cared for, however, with the grid graph and radio descriptions coming from two local stations. The poor mortals that chose to tune in one of the local studio telegraphic relayswith sound effects, soon found that practically every other play the band played the Notre Dame victory march.Those that chose the grid graph were more fortunate, although they were forced to listen to th loud and lusty cheers of Rufus Hartig spurring the Irish on to their final touchdown. We wonder why? Well; two dollars isnt to be sneezed at these days.The fair Mortar Boardswere on hand once again vending a large array of candy, ice cream, doughnuts, and semi-hard cider. With the crowd not quite up to expectations, the girls soon started to eat up all the profits. They were only making slight headway until Lady Gloria arrived on the scene, but then business picked up witli a bang.A couple of the boys put in a bid for the remainder of the cider but couldnt be found when the time came to cart it away. Must have been afraid it would turn to vinegar instead.

Norman Thomas.
Norman Thomas was born November 20, 18S4 at Marion, Ohio. After working at many jobs, he entered Bucknell University, and upon completion of his high school course, worked his way through. The following year he left Bucknell to enter Princeton University where he took courses under Wood row Wilson. He displayed great brilliance of mind throughout and manifested extraordinary qualities as a public speaker. Upon graduation, he engaged in social work where he gained an understanding of the intricate problems of ail classes of people.
He entered Union Theological Seminary, graduating in 190S, having supplemented his education 
with an exhaustive study of the social sciences.
He founded and edited a political magazine. In 1918 he joined the Socialist party. He has since served on innumerable committees lor-strike relief and other causes. His present chief occupation is Executive Director of the League for Industrial Democracy which capacity has brought him into many contacts with young people of college age and with the world of labor.
His theoretical learning has been 
seasoned in the labor struggle, he having taken part in definite union labor activity, and having come to the rescue of suffering strikers at various times. He was a conscientious abjector to the World War and is now internationally recognized as an outstanding exponent of American pacifism.
Critics of Mr. Thomas aim their criticisms, as a rule; at his social views rather than his personal ability. He has been a target for* attacks by communists, and also by a certain group within his own party who contend that he talks too superficially from the Socialist point of view, thereby winning ad
herents who do not understand socialism. They also believe that he is too intellectual to win masses of American labor.
