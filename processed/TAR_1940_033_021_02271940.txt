Newman Members 
Sponsor Chapel; 
Students Invited
Father Paul J. Hock will speak 
at the Lenten Chapel, sponsored 
by the Newman Club, today at 
11:30 in the Theatre, College of 
Fine Arts. His topic is Religious 
Freedom and Its Corresponding 
Responsibilities.
Chaplain for all Catholic stu
dents at Pitt and Carnegie, Father 
Rock is well known on this cam
pus. Last year and the year be
fore, he addressed the Easter 
Chapel and he has appeared be
fore the students on numerous 
other occasions.
Rev. Rock started his career 
as a dentist, graduating from the 
University of Pittsburgh in 1926. 
He studied theology at Mount St. 
Mary in Emmitsburg, Maryland, 
receiving liis degree in 1937. He 
remained, however, to complete 
his graduate work.
Indicating his reasons for 
choosing Religious Freedom as 
the topic of his talk, Father Rock 
said, There is more freedom of 
religious thought here than in 
other countries. We ought to rec
ognize that, and attempt to live 
up to the Constitution so that we 
may continue to enjoy it.
The Newman Club, which is 
sponsoring the chapel, is a nation
al organization of Catholic stu
dents. Chapters in Pittsburgh in
clude those at Carnegie, Pitt and 
Duquesne. The group on campus 
has been active in integrating the 
activities of the Catholic students. 
Recently the Carnegie chapter co
operated actively in Religious 
Emphasis Week.
The Newman Club cordially in
vites all students to attend.

Lciuritz Melchior Suggests Plan 
To Give Young Singers a Start
By Ruth Brodie
A little touch of God 
j That, says
's fnger. 
Lauritz Melchior, 
world-famous Wagnerian tenor, is 
what marks the artist. And any
one who has heard him sing knows 
that God has shaken this artist by 
the hand.
Starting his career as a bari( tone, the Great Dane sang for 
j eight years before he became a 
tenor. He studied singing and act
ing with private teachers, and 
then went on to the Royal Opera 
School, where he was taught not 
only singing, but ballet, languages, 
and the many other things an 
opera singer must know.
Mr. Melchior believes that op
era is the combination of two 
artsacting and music. An actor 
must know how to use his voice 
and his breath, he says, And 
opera is dramathe singer must 
be able to express what his char
acter is feeling. When someone 
without dramatic training gets on 
the stage, he fels that he has 
. five hands and ten feet and he 
j doesnt know what to do with 
any of them.
To give young artists their start,
Mr. Melchior is very anxious to 
see opera houses established 
around the country. These would 
give operas in connection with 
the city symphonies, in English, 
The Metropolitan is the crown of 
a singers career, but it cant be 
the beginning. America must 
give her young artists that be
ginning.
When he learned that Tech had 
a department of music, Mr. Mel
chior expressed his approval of 
combining a musical education 
with a more general one. The 
more knowledge anybody has, the 
better off he is in art, he said, 
You.can lose your money, your 
estates, but your art and what 
you have in your brain is yours. 
Lauritz Melchior, the Siegfried 
of any opera-goers idyll, is 
big man, well suited to the heroic 
roles he sings. He is a hunter 
as well as a singer; he killed all 
the animals whose pelts went in
to his costumes. Mrs. Melchior 
wears a fur coat that her hus
band had made from a panther 
which he shot. It is more fun 
than buying them, he says. And 
then, too, it is not so expensive.

and Design.
The pledge service was held by 
candlelight at the Carnegie Union.
addition, the freshmen think that 
the Social Relations course would 
be vastly improved if irrelevant 
topics and poor lectures were 
eliminated.
No Textbooks
No textbooks are employed by 
the department. Most research 
work is done by Dr. Nathan Mil
ler, Research Assistant of the So
cial Relations Program. He is 
aided by a committee of twelve 
men of the department and a 
battery of secretaries, assorters, 
and staplers. Books, periodicals, 
reports from various institutions, 
newspapers, etc., are carefully 
read, summaries, and condensa
tions are made, and the results 
mimeographed by the social rela
tions organization and the mimeo
graph staff. These sheets are sold 
to students at a nominal price to 
cover the cost of printing. The 
tremendous volume of material to 
be covered is shown by the fact 
that the reading and mimeograph
ing is only one month ahead of 
the actual distribution and study 
of the sheets.
Treatment of subject is unique. 
Instead of employing a fixed 
schedule as is done in the more 
formal studies of history and eco
nomics, each instructor follows 
whatever lines and approaches he 
desires. Conventional boundaries 
between various topics are cros
sed and recrossed. Perhaps this 
explains the fact that little time 
is given to each subject.
Experimental Forum
Carnegie is the only school in 
the country to present this course. 
Although Social Relations is in an 
experimental form, it has already 
aroused the interest of several 
well known colleges. In the near 
future it is expected that Social 
Relations will become an integral 
part of the curricula in most ma
jor universities.

Bald Girls Admitted Free
Each girl will be weighed when

be reduced 25 cents, and baldheaded girls will be allowed free 
admission. Of course, the maxi
mum price is $1.25, so the males 
need not fret if their girl friends 
are extra-heavy. In fact, the 
heaviest as well as the lightest 
girl will be admitted free.
During the intermission period 
the judges will announce the 
names of the lightest and heaviest 
girls, and the escorts of these lucky

Browder Takes His Case 
To The Carnegie Student
Members of the Communist Party (presumably) stood at 
the entrance to the Cut at 8:20 last Friday morning and dis
tributed pamphlets to Carnegie students, entitled, Earl Brow
der Takes His Case to tlie People. At 9:20 the remains oi! the 
pamphlets could be seen scattered 011 the Cut a few feet from 
the point of distribution. They were more than scattered, for 
most of them had been torn into shreds. The proximity of their 
remains to the point of distribution indicated that all that could 
have preceded their destruction was notice of the words Earl 
Browder, and, perhaps, People.
Before proceeding let us clear a point that was misunder
stood in previous editorials. This is not meant as a defense of 
Earl Browder or the Communist Party. Those who see some
thing sinister in the following remarks would probably en
counter a similar difficulty in distinguishing between Mills On 
Liberty, and Marxs Das Capital, or The Declaration of In
dependence and the Communist Manifesto.
The students who destroyed the pamphlets did notdo so 
after having read them, but before. By tearing them, and not 
simply throwing them away, they showed that they were in an 
excited, an emotional, condition. To them the words Brow
der and Communist are associated with things that are 
socially unacceptable. They showed that they are intolerant, 
and that they condemn1 without examination of facts.
AVhen democracy was established it was assumed that the 
citizens would be so happy with the prospect of liberty of 
thought and action that they would enthusiastically welcome the 
opportunity to examine all issues before making decisions. Cen
turiesof repression had been conquered, and the fathers of 
American democracy must have believed that a nation of think
ers would emerge.
O11 Friday Earl Browder was condemned because he is a 
Communist, and because Communism is considered bad. So, 
many of the students who received the pamphlets were afraid 
to read them. They laughed at them or were angry at having 
received them. They felt that they should not have believed 
what they might have read, and since they themselves did not: 
have sufficient information 011 hand to refute whatever they 
light readthey destroyed the pamphlets.
Those on Friday morning who watched a workman on the 
Cut cleaning up the refuse, must have known that lie was 
glossing over tlie destruction of more than meie paper, more 
than mere words, for the very thing had been destroyed that 1 
some of our students thought they were protectingdemocracy. J
Metallurgists, Back in Town9 
Tell of Hectic Eastern Trip !
Metallurgy students who re
turned last week from an eastern 
tour, put their combined stamp 
-of approval on the modern .meth
ods of education. Between in
specting life on Broadway and 
aion-ferrous metal plants, the 
Tech boys led a merry lifeand 
learned no end of things, some 
of which were even metallurgical.
It has been rumored that Mayor 
La Guardia felt much better when 
the last Tech man left town, but 
dont judge the boys from a nasty 
rumor.' True, the New York taxi 
drivers did have a few minor 
disagreements with the metallurg
istsremember Wednesday, the 
day of the. big blizzard? Well six 
of the boys from Tech, after 
dodging pedestrians, busses, and 
full cabs, finally flagged an empty 
taxi and proceeded to pile in 
literally that isuntil the driver 
quite discourteously, turned 
around and announced, Youse 
guys get out. I aint gonna take 
no six of you for twenty cents.
Whereupon the senior member of 
the groupwell call him George 
(because thats his name) got out, 
and started to walk carefully 
around the cab as if looking for 
a nice soft spot to lack.
One neat little incident conONE OF THE BOYS
.... DICK MANNING
Interviewers stay away! Hes 
modest and doesnt like to talk 
about himself, which makes Dick 
Manning 40, an island in a sea 
of campus big-shots. Editor of 
the Technical, President of the 
YMCA, -Dragon, Delta Skull Pi 
Delta Epsilon and former presi
dent of his social fraternity Kap
pa Sigmathat ought to be some
thing to talk about.
He started acquiring honors 
early. He was awarded member
ship in the National Honor So
ciety, high school scholarship and 
service honorary while attending 
Dormont High School. Dick want
ed to go to an out-of-town school, 
but finances decreed that it would 
be Carnegie or nothing. He pick
ed Carnegie. Not too happy about 
his choice, he almost quit school 
in his freshman year. Since then, 
he has become hardened to it. 
What bothers him about school is 
riding in street cars, but thats 
almost over.
A metallurgist, hes pointing to
ward the iron and steel field, al
though he isnt sure in which 
phase he wants to specialize.
If you take Dicks word for it 
he has led a pretty uneventful 
life. Outside of a litle travelingsome time in the State of Wash

mer, Waterbury Conn. on the 
Metallurgy trip, etc.and several 
minor accidentslike almost los
ing an eye in a mishap when he 
was twelve-nothing noteworthy 
has happened to him.
By the way, Dick Manning is 
in charge of tickets for Spring 
Carnival, so if you want to wangle 
a couple of comps, I guess hes the 
one to see.
From most of the reports we 
have been hearing, jobs are more 
plentiful this year than they have 
been since Hector was a pup. No 
one will kick about that. Just one 
comment, however. Interview
ers seem more than a little partial 
to the boys with the good lines. 
Just part of the old story, it pays 
to advertise. So tell your little 
brother and grandchildren that 
besides acquiring book learning, 
social life, sense of social respon
sibility, and culture, he had bet
ter learn to sling it smoothly, at 
college.
The Guild Bazaar was really a 
bizarre form of entertainment. 
(Ouch) Successful financially and 
socially, too, wed say. A good 
idea for next year and the year 
after. Provided, of course the 
women are willing to put the 
work into it again as they did this 
time.
The Margaret Morrison Senate is 
sponsoring a forum this after
noon just in case you havent 
read about it yet. Heres a 
chance to air your pet gripes. 
Even if nothing is done about 
them, youll feel better to get 
them off your mind.
Did the Thistle really mean 
it when it called for workers? 
Wed bet that when staff ap
pointments are made, the call 
will be much more specific, Wellll, 
maybe Betas are the only ones 
that do any work who knows?
The publicity commitees of sun
dry dances would appreciate it 
if you fellows would leave the 
pictures of beauteous female vo
calists on the posters on the bul
letin boards until after the dance 
is over. Or at least for an hour, 
until a few people have seen it 
loo.
And you, Squicr, might like to 
know that people find the noise 
of your girder-hammering quite 
annoying at basketball games. Be
sides, some day you might knock 
down the roof, and then youd be 
sorry.

But dont get the wrong - idea 
about the tour, the metallurgists

The "Terrible Tartans tasted 
bitter defeat at the hands ol! the 
PiKAs last Saturday night. In 
spite of their beautiful bodyblocking and well timed oli-tackle 
plays, the A. A. A. boys were un
able to bottle up the slippery 
maroon quintet.
Johnny Lloyd, as he strode sav
agely from the court, muttered

C CLUB MAY BE REVIVED
DOC BURKE, Sports Editor --
It has been suggested by a group of letter winners that the 
(now defunct C Club be revived. Along this line letters have 
been mailed to the captain and manager of each of the following 
teams: football, basketball, hockey, soccer, swimming, track, 
cross-country, rifle, tennis, and golf.
A meeting of the above representatives will be held some
time this week in the Student Union to talk over the possibility 
of the revival of this club. All those receiving letters are urged 
to attend this meeting.
C Club and Its Purposes
The  C  Club is for men who have won their letter in one 
or more activities. The purposes for reorganizing this club are:
1. The unification of varsity athletes to promote more 
friendly relations among the athletes.
2. To encourage participation in varsity sports and the 
athletic program.
3. To aid and strengthen the sad plight of Carnegie Techs 
athletic teams.
4. To have a large dinner or similar event to award all 
letters and special honors.
5. To definitely arouse more student spirit in athletics.
6. To assist ormore likelyto criticize the Steffen Memo
rial Athletic Fund.
7. To select a member of the C Club to take the place of 
a football player who is now on the Athletic Board.
Cooperation of All Concerned Is Needed
In order for the C Club to again become a reality, there 
must be full cooperation of all those concerned. This coopera
tion should be forthcomingin view of the fact that Tech is one 
of the few colleges which does not have a varsity lettermens 
club.
Among those schools well known for their lettermenls clubs 
are-Notre Dame and Alabama, to name only two of a large 
number. Notre Dames club is so well organized that the alumni 
function actively, while Alabamas A Club is one of the best 
organizations on that campus.
Let us hope that in the very near future Carnegie Tech will 
have a lettermens club that can compare favorably to those of 
other schools.
By placing first in eight of the 
nine events on the swimming card, 
the Carnegie Swimmers scored 
their fifth win of the season. The 
win was chalked up against the 
mermen from Delaware Univer
sity, and helped to soothe some of 
the old wounds inflicted by this 
same aggregation last year.
The victorious Tartans, paced 
all the way by Jim Lockhead, and 
Harold Hirsch, were successful in 
taking the first eight consecutive 
events before dropping the final 
event on the docketthis being 
the 400 yard relay.
Hirsch took the 220 and 440 
yard free style events, and Lockhead was successful'in the 50 and 
100 yard sprint races.
Chuck Patterson won the fancy 
diving, Bill Molvie romped home 
first in the back stroke event, and 
Eddie Lynch beat out Big Will 
Anthony to take the initial posi
tion in the 200 yard breast stroke 
race.

On Thursday night, the Du

Skibo skaters for the fourth con
secutive time. With two last pe
riod goals, Bill Vance broke the 
1-1 tie and defeated the Tartans 
3-1.
The Tech icers started the scor
ing in the first period, when Block 
picked up a rebound from 
Schelawskes shot and slipped it 
past the Duke goalie. In the sec
ond period, Hansberry broke the 
puck from behind the cage and 
sent it into the mesh for the ty
ing counter. Feiler chalked up 
twelve of his twenty-three saves 
in this period and prevented a 
Tartan rout. Vance broke loose 
around the Tech defense for the 
first of his unassisted goals in the 
third period, and two minutes lat
er on a, similar break, he scored 
again. Feilers performance over
shadowed the efforts of the rest of 
the men on the floor, although 
Vance, Burleighj and Wilson play
ed a rugged game.
The team may travel to Johns
town to meet Penn State this Fri
day. If they dont the next game 
will be with Case on March ninth 
in the afternoon at the Gardens.

On March 2nd
Amid the most modern of set
tings Carnegie Tech evening stu
dents and their friends will cele
brate one of the oldest traditions 
on the night campus on Saturday 
evening, when Evening Student 
Councils holds its annual Wash
ingtons Birthday Dance.
Clyde Knights band will fur
nish the music. The music will 
begin in Thistle Hall at nine 
oclock, and dancing will continue 
until midnight.
Through the years, the Wash
ingtons Birthday Dance has come 
to be known as one of the most 
colorful on the evening calendar. 
Decorations carry out the red, 
white, and blue motif of the pat
riotic holiday.
Corsages will be supplied for 
the first two hundred ladies who 
arrive at Thistle Hall, as usual. 
The combination of tastefully ar
ranged corsages, popular orches
tra, decorative novelties and the 
success of similar events in the 
past is expected to fill Thistle Hall 
early in the evening.
Washingtons Birthday was 
usually selected as the night of 
the dance in. past years. This 
years delayed date was not set, 
as might be supposed, to give 
President Roosevelt an opportu
nity to commit himself on the first 
presidents ideas regarding a third 
term.  Elimination of February 22 
as a holiday from the school, ne
cessitated the change.
Saturday evenings affair will 
be a far cry from the quadrilles 
and reels of Washingtons day. 
The ghosts of the patriot and his 
lovely wife, Martha, would prob
ably be quite concerned over the 
evolution of the dance since their 
day, were they to drop into 
Thistle Hall. For even though 
the swing sessions will be inter
polated with sweet music, the 
pace will be somewhat faster than 
it was 150 years ago.
Evening Student Council held 
its first Washingtons Birthday 
Dance in the school year of 1923- 
24. With its many opportunities 
for novel decorations and pro
grams built around the hatchet, 
cherry tree, and flag themes, it 
was an instant success and has 
continued to grow in popularity.
Engineers Aid 
Extra Dance
New Orchestra 
To Be Introduced
Saturday, the ninth of March 
is the date of the second dance 
of the school year sponsored by 
the Evening College of Engineer
ing. This is the first year, in the 
recollection of many old-timers 
on the campus, that the En
gineers have planned two dances 
on one calendar, it being a re
sponse to popular demand on the 
part of many students and their 
friends.
The Committee and Officers in 
charge for the evening have 
talked it over with Mr. Brotzman, 
who predicts fair weather and an 
almost cloudless sky; a perfect 
setting for the new moon prom
ised for that night.
The Engineers, always known 
for careful planning, will undoubt
edly do themselves proud once 
again. Theyll come across with 
something new in the way of 
novel programs or decorations or 
what have you  but leave that 
to the Engineers.
Dances are planned on attend
ance; usually the greater number 
of patrons, the nicer the dance. 
Now is the time to plan on be
ing there.

your-own
Policy
Adopted
Have the orchestras at the 
former social affairs been satis
factory or didnt you care for the 
style of music that was played?
In order to find out just what 
style of music the students like, 
the Evening Student Council  is 
conducting an inquiry in an at
tempt to find out who your fa
vorite orchestra are?
We are endeavox-ing to find out 
what style of music the students 
likewhether it be swing or 
sweet. Do you care for male or 
female vocalists and would you 
like to see more big name bands 
come to the Tech Campus? Do 
you like the bands that have been 
invading the campus grounds?
Questions will be gladly answer
ed by writing to the Editor of the 
Carnegie Plaid, or to Frank J.

Student Council, Box 136 C. I. T.
IVii Points
-Ed NussTwo years ago the officers of 
the administration realized the 
need for a larger meeting place 
for student affairs and, in an ef
fort to solve the problem, they 
purchased the Beeler Mansion and 
dedicated it Nas the New Carnegie 
Union.
Since that time only a small 
percentage of the evening students 
have made use of the privileges 
which the building offers them. 
It is available for party use by 
any group providing they make 
proper application in advance, and 
obey the regulation which must 
be imposed on them.
In the basement of the .building 
are located the trophy and game 
rooms. Evening students . may 
make use of the game room fa
cilities any evening during the 
week until 12 oclock closing time, 
when the building must be 
cleared.
Few changes have been made 
to destroy the homelike atmos
phere of the first floor. Its large 
rooms are attractively furnished 
and any student who desires to 
spend a few hours of quiet study 
will find just the . conditions he 
desires here. There is a large, 
well-equipped kitchen which may 
be used by any groups who may 
be holding a party in the build
ing and a room equipped with a 
recording machine which may be 
used by those who wish to dance.
Conference rooms. and the 
rooms occupied by Mrs. Chax-les 
Yon, the charming hostess of the 
Union, comprise most of the sec
ond floor. Mrs. Yon is always 
willing to help the students in 
any way, and her aid is one of 
the main reasons for the success 
of the events held there.
All the offices of the student 
publications are located on the 
thix-d floor of the building, and 
students, interested in the Plaid 
should report here Friday even
ing.
Any evening students who have 
failed to Visit the Union this year 
should do so as soon as possible. 
Its our building so lets use it.

Elect Geilman 
As Secretary
Chosen Officer 
Honored This Year 
With Scholarships
Students in the Evening College 
of Fine Arts this year elected as 
their Secretary, Hax'old F. Geil
man. Hal has been doing fine 
work on the campus for several 
years and no matter how difficult 
an assignment is given to him, 
either in class or in extra-curricu
lar activity, he carries it through 
skillfully to completion.
Although he has been on the 
campus for five years, Harold has 
been in the Fine Arts School only 
four yeaxs, the remaining year be
ing enrolled in Engineering.  He 
is studying architecture, and his 
friends predict a brilliant career 
for him in this profession, for he 
has an abundance of artistic sense. 
He belongs to Nu Sigma Alpha 
fraternity.
Harolds secondary education 
was x-eceived in Allderdice High 
School where he maintained a 
high scholastic rating through the 
four years. In his senior year he 
was traffic engineex* in charge 
of the city planning system of 
the model city which they constx*ucted there. He developed his 
tennis ability in high school also.
Despite spending five nights a 
week in school and six days at 
work, he hustles around, giving 
a helping hand, explaining, I 
just like to keep busy. He must 
have activity always. Hax-old is 
the winner of two Activity Keys, 
one Activity Scholarship and one 
Institute Scholaxship.
This dark-eyed, handsome 
young man is quite a philosopher. 
He never worries, but does plan 
ahead for each succeeding step. 
He likes to give out the cox*sages 
at the dances, taking pleasure in 
watching how some of the girls 
x-eceive them'as a matter of course 
and others with much giaiitude. 
Incidentally, it is no coincidance 
that the young ladies X'eceive fxom 
Hax'old the exact contrast in flow
ers, for his quick glance at their 
costumes and his deft fingex-s in 
selection of the corsage insure 
this. He is truly the possessor of 
the esthetic faculty.
While he reveals no facts re
garding sentimental attachments, 
the general feeling is that at least 
one fair Juliet exists in his life.
Enrollment 
Shows Gain 
Over 1939
Engineers Have 
Greatest Increase 
Of Three Colleges
Evening school registration fig
ures, with all enrollments tabu
lated, show an incx-ease of only 
83 students over last years final 
registx-ation total. All gioups 
shared ixx the increased enrollment 
with the exception of Margaret 
Moi'risori Carnegie College.
Largest gains were made in the 
College of Engineering. Last year, 
878 budding engineex-s enx*olled; 
this year, 37 more students registei-ed, bringing the total enrollment to 915.
The Vocationals section ran a 
close second, with a final regis
tx-ation figure of 1,111. Last year, 
registrations in this group to
talled only 1,079, 32 below the 
1940 figure.
Enrollment in the College of 
Fine Arts reached a total that 
exceeded last years only by 20 
students. Last veax*s total regis
tration for the section was 433; 
this yeais 453.
Only 75 students enrolled in 
Margaret Morrison Carnegie Col
lege, six less than last year. To
tal registration this semester, for 
all colleges is 2,554 students.

Report on meeting held Sunday, 
February 4, 1940 and special meet
ing held on Thursday, February 
8, 1940.
President Marcinizyn reported 
that Mr. Russell Stroeschein was 
found to be eligible to hold of
fice in Council, having been se
lected by the remaining Industries 
officers and approved by Council 
to fill the vacancy created by the 
resignation of Mr. Joseph Klemp, 
president of that college. By 
agreement among the officers, Mr. 
Nicholas Rollinger who was sex-ving as vice president became presi
dent and Mr. Stroeschein became 
vice president.
Because of the ineligibility of 
I Mr. Robert B. Thompson at theI
 close of the fix*st semester to hold 
office as vice president of En
gineering, a vacancy was declared 
in that college by the Council 
president. The name of Mx\ 
George W. Hurtt, Jr., was sub
mitted and approved by Council.
Mr. Thompson having also been 
Assistant Social Chairman, it was 
therefore necessai-y to fill this va
cancy, Mr. Joseph H. Gummo was 
elected to succeed him.
Council decided that the most 
efficient channel by which they 
could relay information to the 
student body was through the 
newspaper. It is the duty of the 
Council to publish notice of all 
actions affecting the entire Even
ing Student Body in the college 
papers after such actions are 
taken and because of the inef
ficiency of the system tried the 
first semester, it was decided to 
mail the newspapers to the stu
dents, the cost to be defrayed by 
the three colleges according to 
percentage of enrollment. Council 
has felt that issues have arisen 
in which the welfare of council 
itself as well as the entire student 
body is concerned and that it Is 
necessary to be able to reach 
every student and keep in close 
touch with them.
A letter from President Doher
ty in answer to Councils request 
stated that any student who paid 
the $3.00 matriculation fee prior 
to Sep|e;mber,. 1939 would not be 
i required to pay a graduation fee, 
px'ovided there is no interruption 
' in the student schedule.
Council members feel that be
cause of the limited space and 
crowded condition of the dances 
in Thistle Hall, the "jitterbugging 
should be curtailed.
All PJaid Issues 
Will Be Mailed
Beginning with the current is
sue the Carnegie Plaid will again 
be mailed to the night students 
each week. The plan of placing 
the paper in the racks in the hail 
has proven too inconvenient for 
the students to be a satisfactory 
method of distributing the paper 
to them.
Since the Plaid is the only sure 
method the evening students have 
of receiving news about the so
cial functions of the vax-ious col
leges, Council has decided to x-einstate the old custom of mail in g.
