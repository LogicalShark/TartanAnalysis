INT. ER-SCHOOLS TRACK MEET.
The first of the series of inter-school track meets 
to be held each year between the schools of Applied 
Science, Applied Design, and the School for Appren
tices and Journeymen, took place last Saturday morn
ing on tihe Schenley Oval. For a first annual, it was a 
marked success. The events were run off with prac
tically no delay, due to the g(j)od management. The 
only mishap marring the day was the accident which 
resulted in the breaking of . Glassers arm.

BETHANY WINS
Final Score, 30
DAILY ALLOWS FOUR HITS.
Bethany won from Tech by the score of 3o last 
Saturday on Tech Field. Daily, pitching for Bethany, 
allowed just four hits and struck out seven men. 
Beisgen pitched for Tech and allowed only three real 
hits, although the several hit balls were as good as 
hits due to the errors made behind him. Beisgen also 
struck out ten men and walked only four.
FIRST INNING.
The first ball pitched went over for a strike. It did 
not seem to worry Henry, who promptly singled. Imhoss attempted to sacrifice but was struck out, Henry 
stealing second. Riggs was walked. Henry stole 
third and went home on a wild throw by Gerhart, Riggs 
taking third during the mix-up. Beisgen then struck 
out McElroy aind Bailey.
Vail was given a pass to first and stole second. 
Morehead struck out. Colden sacrificed Vail to third, 
where he was left, Mason going out, Bailey to McLain.
SECO'ND INNING.
Eales knocked the ball to Vatz, who threw to Morehead, retiring the runner. Lewis, after trying to make 
Beisgen hit him, struck out. McLain was, walked but 
was left on first when Shuttlewonth struck out.
Wehr, opening for Tech, was safe at first on poor 
throw by Henry. Vatz was safe on fielder's choice, 
Weber being put c>ut at second. Blanchard was hit by 
pitched ball, sending Vatz to second. With men on 
first and second and only one down, Techs chances of 
scoring looked good. Doc Dailey spoiled them, 
however, by striking out Gerhart and Beisgen.
THIRD INNING.
Henry was walked and stole second. Imhoff out, 
Beisgen to Moorehead. Riggs struck out. McEvoy 
knocked the ball to right field and, on Wehrs error
took two bases. Dailey grounded to Gerhart, but the 
ball was too hot to handle cleanly and everybody was 
safe. Eales flew out to Gerhart, closing the inning 
for Bethany.
'For Tech, Vail grounded toward first and was out, 
McLain unassisted. Moorehead went out by the Dailley-McLain route. Coldren got Tech's first hit, a sin
gle to right field. Mason knocked the ball over 
second base for what looked to be a single, but McEl
roy, after a run, made a beautiful catch, retiring the 
side. Score, Bethany 2, Tech 0.
FOURTH INNING.
Lewis struck out. McLain knocked a foul that tore 
Masons thumb so badly that he had to leave the game. 
Wehr came in from right field to catch and Fulmer 
was sent to right field to replace Wehr. McLain finally 
went out, Beisgen to Moreland, Beisgen making a very 
pretty stop. Shuttleworth knocked a single to right 
field but was left on bases when Henry flew out to 
Blanchard.
Wehr flew out to Riggs in middle field. Vatz went 
out, Dailey to McLain, and Blanchard knocked a fly 
to McEvoy.
FIFTH INNING.
Imhoff opened with a grounder to Peaches and 
was out at first. Riggs was safe on Vatz's error. Mc
Evoy was then walked, forcing Riggs to second. Baley tried hard but only succeeded in flying out to Vail, 
whose throw in caught Riggs at third.
Gerhart struck out. Beisgen fouled outto Henry 
and Vail flew out to Riggs in middle field. Score still
2o in Bethanys favor.
SIXTH INNING.
Bethany went down in one, two, three order. Eales 
struck out. Lewis went out, Vatz to Moorehead, and 
McLain went out, Coldren to Moorehead.

---------------------------------------------------

THE TARTAN
FINISH OF THE
Tech should have scored in this inning, but by poor 
work on the bases two men, Moorehead and Coldren, 
were caught between third and home. Moorehead 
opened by a single. Coldren got his second hit, a sin
gle, sending Moorehead to third. Moorehead was 
then run down between third and home, Coldren going 
to second. Fullmer fouled out to Imhoff. Wehr sin
gled to right field, but Coldren was caught at the plate 
by Shuttleworth's throw in, flhus closing the inning.
SEVENTH INNING.
Shuttleworth knocked a fly to Gerhart, who made a 
good catch. Henry struck out and Imhoff went out 
on a grounder to Coldren. Another one, two, three 
inning.
For Tech, Vatz knocked one to right field that should 
have been good for a single. He was so slow in start
ing, however, that he was put out. Blanchard was hit 
on the head and Wehr was sent in to run for him. 
Gerhart grounded to Eales, who started a double play, 
the ball going Eales to McEvoy to McLain. This 
closed the inning, the score still remaining 2o in 
Bethanys favor.
EIGHTH INNING.
Bethany scored another run in this inning. Riggs 
went out, Gerhart to Moorehead. McEvoy knocked a 
high one to Vatz. who dropped it. McEvoy then stole 
second and went to third on a passed ball. Dailey 
knocked on to' Vail in left field, wTho should have had 
it but did not. McEvoy scored and Dailey went to 
third on the error. Eales flew out to Blanchard, who 
caught Dailey at the plate by a perfect throw to W'ehr.
Beisgen struck out and Vail followed his example. 
Moorehead went out on a grounder to McEvoy. The 
score at the close of the inning was, Bethany 3, Tech o.
NINTH INNING.
Lewis opened for Bethany by a fly to Vail, who 
dropped it. Lewis started for second and Vail pegged 
the ball to Coldren. Coldren might have bad Lewis 
out but he forgot to turn around and touch him. Mc
Lain sacrified Lewis to third. Shuttleworth struck out 
and Henry fouled out to Wehr, closing the game as far 
as Bethany was concerned.
LOW HURDLES.
Coldren struck out for the first and only time in the 
game. Fullmer was walked, Coldren sending Charles 
in to run for him. Wehr sacrificed Charles to second, 
from which base he stole third on the slide he attempted 
to kn6ck the bag out of the way with forced to retire, 
Wehr replacing him. Vatz could only knock a single 
fly to Dailey, thus closing the game. Final scores

CARNEGIE LIBRARY NEWS.
A mo,st interesting exhibition of college pictures is 
being held in the rooms north of the Reference Room 
in the Carnegie Library at Schenley Park. There are 
twenty-one colleges represented in this collection and 
one gets a very comprehensive idea of them, so good 
are the views of the various buildings, grounds and in
teriors which have been sent for this spring exhibit. 
The rooms will be open every week day from g A. M.

BILL FOR HARMONIOUS STREETS.
Apropos of the recent discussionsin this department 
of harmony in street architecture, the Commissioners 
of the District of Columbia have been working over 
a bill designed to secure such a result. As drawn, the 
bill provided that with the consent of go per cent, of 
the property owners, any street or part of a street 
might be subjected to special building regulations. The 
regulations to be thus established might include alter
ations and repairs, the prohibition of business struc
tures from residential neighborhoods, the establishment 
of a building line, etc. The Commissioners could veto 
building materials and even the architectural design of 
dwellings, stores, office buildings, theatres or apart
ments. The idea,- says Municipal Journal, is to 
give to the whole city a beautiful and harmonious ap
pearance. The measure provides that within a year 
after the Commissioners have designated any street or 
section for the enforcement of these special regulations 
any one who has not given consent and whoclaims to 
have been deprived of his property rights can tell his 
story in /the Court of Appeals. Streets would be 
known as Class A streets and Class B streets and 
the Commissioners would favor the former in recom
mendations for street improvements. This goes fur
ther than any attempt previously made in the United 
States to secure by ordinance harmony in the construc
tion along a street. But Washingtons special needs in 
this respect, and special short comings, make it a good 
place to. try the experiment.The Architectural Reecrd.
APPLIED SCIENCE SENIOR BALL, RITTENHOUSE, JUNE 14.
PROF. HOWER ON ELECTRIC WAVES.
The fourth of the series of lectures being given for 
the benefit of the general public on scientific subjects 
took place in the Assembly Hall of the School of Ap
plied Science last Wednesday night. Wlith attendance 
steadily on the increase, it will be difficult to accom
modate any more in the Hiall if as much interest is 
manifested in those yet to come. The speaker happily 
and cleverly combined two treatments of the subject 
for the benefit of those in the audience who had a pre
vious knowledge of the subject, and for those who had 
not. Many engineers and men of science wrere present, 
and for their benefit brief portions here and there were 
treated in a highly technical manner. Experiments 
made the lecture one of interest to others.
Considerable apparatus was in evidence as the lec
turer began with hi.< explanation of just what con
stituted an electric wave, and howr these waves are 
used at the present time for wireless telegraphy and 
telephony. With metal screens waves were reflected 
into a receiving apparatus designed to ring a bell when 
received, and served as a means of illustrating how 
waves may be directed, as can those of light. As the 
subject was more deeply entered into, lantern slides of 
diagrams of connections, were made good use of. The 
harmlessness of the brush from high potential dis
charge was well illustrated with some spectacular dis
plays. The experiment designed to display the differ
ence occasioned by the tuning of the receiving appara
tus wa one very seldom seen in the lecture hall on 
account of the difficulty of performance. The lecture 
was one of absorbing interest throughout, and well at
tended. At an estimate, fully half of those in attendence were forced to stand about the walls.
CIVIL ENGINEERING SOCIETY.
The Civil Engineering Society will hold its next 
meeting on Monday evening. May 16. A special invi
tation is extended to those Plebes intending to take 
the Civil Engineering Course, to attend this meeting 
and become acquainted with the instructors and stu
dents. A large attendance of active and graduate mem
bers is desired.

EDITORIAL
A COMMUNICATION.
May 9th, 1910.
To the Students: 
The time has arrived when it would seem wise to 
bring to the attention of the students and the man
agers and captains of the various student organiza
tions, the desirability of uniformity in the pennant 
and insignia.
Permit me to suggest the title of Carnegie" to re
place the local abbreviation Tech. It is equally 
euphonious, more dignified and conforms to the desig
nation used by other institutions of learning such as 
Yale, Harvard, Columbia, Lehigh, etc. There are 
many Techs and since our students are recruited 
from many parts of the country it is important to 
build up, under a uniform title, the student spirit and 
individuality for which we are all striving.
Of course the plaid pennants will always be best 
and we must be careful not to loose the distinctive 
Tartan. If, however, there is an occasion which de
mands it, each School could use its own distinctive 
color. But there should be on all of the pennants 
the word Carnegie in plain letters, if the pennant 
itself is not made of Tartan. The Schools could then 
undertake to purchase and have in stock large quanti
ties of these letters made in various sizes and avail
able for any organization that needs them, at cost 
prices.
I hope it may be possible to bring about this result 
and trust that the students and Faculties may co
operate to this end.
Respectfully,
A. A. HAMERSCHLAG,
Director.
SATURDAYS TRACK MEET.
The first of the inter-schools track meets to be 
given annually is reported in detail in another por
tion of this issue. The interest manifested by the 
student body in general and the number of entries of 
new men, at once stamp it as an achievement of the 
desired end; to discover and encourage new men. It 
was a splendid meet, and shows a great advance
ment in interest, spirit and good fellowship.
CARNEGIE, NOT JUST TECH.
The communication from Dr. Hamerschlag relative 
to the adoption of more distinctive wording for 
pennants and insignia, is very much to the point and 
would be a sane and sensible move.. While the insti
tution is young it is possible to make these changes, 
which may seem slight and trifling at the present 
time, but which gather in importance slowly and sure
ly as time goes on. The idea of dispensing with a 
too liberal use and application of the single word 
Tech as applied to Carnegie Tech is such an evi
dent thing as the Director sets it for for us to preach 
on its wiseness. It is altogether the proper thing 
to do, and we blush to admit that we have not al
ready advised it.
OUR CORRESPONDENCE.
It is with the deepest regret that we notice that 
these columns are not made use of by the student 
body for the publication of expressions of opinion 
relative to things of interest and concern in connec
tion with the Institution. If we ever expect to hear 
all the sides of every question of general interest, 
or receive suggestions for action and deeds in the 
future, this means of airing opinion must be made 
use of. By observing the one simple requirements of 
signing the communication, and specifying whether 
or not the signature is for publication, The Tartan 
will be glad to give space at any time.

THE THISTLE.
A CRITICISM.
The All-Schools Book is born. Everyone is craving 
for a lookfirst impressions and first expressions are 
coming in from every quarter. How do you like it ? 
Rotten! Nothing in it but Applied Design, fair, best 
yet; are some of the comments heard. The favorable 
expressions seem to predominate however, and those 
who take the trouble to go over the main features can 
not fail to be impressed.
The cover is pleasing; the illustrations, without 
doubt, the best ever turned out. Miller and Tenor of 
the Illustrating department, seem to have gotten a mo
nopoly on title pages, and it is well that they did.
Some of the ads. seem misplaced, the Mutts should 
mot have had a page. M. M. C. S. Seniors, a,s usual, 
did not give their ages. All of which is microscopic 
when compared with the trials of ad. getting, proof
reading, and arrangement of material to please every
one.
The Editor and Business Manager expect a leward 
of knocks, it has always been so ever since that day 
way back in history when the indignant member moved 
that the All Schools Book" should have a leather 
cover.

A VISIT TO THE FORT PITT.
The first of a scries of visits to local institutions was 
made last week, by the Senior Household Arts stu
dents in institutional management, Miss Bradt teache-r.
The Port Pitt kitchen was the place visited. This is 
in the basement of the hotel, and the extreme cleanli
ness and sanitary condition of every nook and cranny 
of the place, was perfectly apparent. We were piloted 
around by one of the hotel employes who was kindness 
itself. No question was too trivial for him to answer 
and every department of the kitchen, he explained to 
us fully.
They serve, on an average, 200 persons at breakfast, 
200 at lunch and 500 at dinner. There are three stew
ards. one head, one day steward and one night steward. 
Of the 450 employes, 7& are waiters and 32 are chefs. 
These latter are over many cooks, butchers, etc. The 
dishes are washed by 10 men, but are not dried. The 
scalding waiter in which they are rinsed serves that 
purpose. Glass and silver require 13 people to wash 
and polish.
There are many store rooms which require to be re
stocked every Thursday. There is also an enormous 
refrigerating plant, in which there are separate rooms 
for fowl, fresh meats and smoked. A glimpse into one 
of these rooms would convince one that an army was 
about to be fed. All sea foods are kept in another 
part of the plant. Cracked ice is put into shelves with 
the oysters, clams, lobsters, etc., and these open and 
close like bureau drawers.
The bakery is another entirely independent depart
ment ; the baking is done in brick ovens, and each 
oven is capable of baking hundreds of loaves at one 
time.
There are seven bakers,-and five confectioners; the 
latter try their ingenuity in making candy flowers, 
fruits and like conceits as well as the regulation bon
bon.
We saw the engine room and felt very sorry for the 
man who had to stay in such a hot place. Then and 
there we turned over a brand new leaf. The dynamos 
excited our admiration for the gigantic brain which 
conceived them. We could only stare and wonder at 
them not knowing anymore about them than a pig 
does about Sunday. The ice plant impressed us with 
a sense of the power of mans brain. It is capable of 
freezing 600 feet of ice in 48 hours.
We learned that each day the patrons of the hotel 
consumed, in one way or another, 180 dozen eggs and 
100 gallons of milk. Lit us hope, for the prosperity #f 
the hotel, that none of them put the egg in their shoes 
and beat it.
From the kitchens we went through the private din
ing rooms. The Dutch room is very effectively decor
ated in Flemish oak. Each chair has the Pittsburg 
coat of arms carved in the back. Th large marble
mantel is very odd, four Dutch plates being incor
porated into it in some mysterious fashion.
In the Norse room, the Gothic arch ceiling tiled like 
the floor and walls, gave a decidedly Moorish appear
ance. The story by Longfellow, of the Skeleton in 
Armour, is told in tile around the walls. The quaint 
shaped tables and odd looking chairs, harmonize per
fectly with the rest of the room. The whole atmos
phere is odd but pleasing.
Wie visited the Banquet Hall last, and determined 
then and there to dine at the Fort Pitt forever. It is 
not only gorgeous but also beautiful. The floor is cov
ered with oriental rugs and the furniture and hangings 
match perfectly.
Know' all men by these presents, the Fort Pitt Hotel 
is the place to get a really square meal in, one with all 
the frills, too. Nothing could be better either from a 
gastronomic or hygienic point of view. And last, but 
certainly not least, the service is all that the humar 
heart or stomach could desire.
The last regular meeting of the Dramatic Club was 
held on Thursday, when all business for the year was 
settled. According to the constitution, a committee 
for reorganization next year was elected from the 
present Junior Class. Miss Laureta Kemple was elect
ed chairman, with Mrs. Green and Miss Florence Flinn 
as assistants.
Miss We*t was in Cincinnati Founders Day.
Miss Cauble and Dr. Martin have both been in the 
East recently, Miss Cauble having been called there by 
her fathers illness, while Dr. Martin spent the short 
Founders Day vaoation with her sister.

WHERE CHRISTIAN SCIENCE FAILS.
To understand the failures of Christian Science 
we must understand the state of her mind. Spirit, 
she says, is all; matter is nothing. Diseases are an 
error, illusion, or dream of mortal mind; they are 
real on our mortal plane, but they are not really 
real, they are not really there. Once we are sure
It follows that she denies the reality of all germs 
and all internal parasites. Mortal mind imagines 
that mosquitoes, tsetse flies, fleas, and oysters are 
able to convey to man the germs which in him are 
malaria, yellow fever, sleeping sickness, plague and 
typhoid fever. Christian Science says that the symp
toms of these diseases are the work of mortal mind; 
we believe that we are ill, and we are healed by 
convincing ourselves that the whole thing is an il
lusion.
But what about the diseases of animals? What of 
the millions and millions of worms, fishes, reptiles, 
birds, mammals dying of this or that disease? Is 
tubercle in a monkeys lungs an error of mortal 
mind or of monkey mind? Is lockjaw in a horse 
an error of equine mind? Or is the error in us? In 
that case the horse is under no illusion. Therefore
it is not suffering, but here it is dead. Well, says 
Christian Science, death itself is an illusion. But 
the horse was not a Christian Scientist; it had no 
opinion one way or the other touching the reality of 
death. Therefore, is it, or is it not really dead? 
Was it in real pain, in real convulsions? Was that 
pain a dream in us or in it? If pain, disease, and 
death, rending all creation, are an illusion of human 
minds, then no animal is really in pain, diseased, or 
dead. But what of the millions and millions of ani
mals that perished before mortal mind appeared on 
this earth? On the other handr if the pain, disease, 
and death of animals are not in us, but in the ani
mals, where they certainly seem to be, then they 
must be really real; for it is impossible that canine 
mind should share the high illusions of human mind. 
All those diseases, therefore, which are transmissible, 
between animals and u&glanders, anthrax, lock
jaw, tubercle, etc.must be accounted as real in 
the animals but not in us.
Forgetting the Animal World.
The fact is, that Christiafi Science left out of her 
universe all creatures except us. She was so busy

making a God of man that she forgot the animals. 
And now, if you ask her about the pain, disease, and 
death of these fellow-creatures of ours, she says, 
Animals, like human* beings, are suffering from the 
belief in the power of evil which constitutes mortal 
mind: and can be, and are being, cured in the same 
way. In plain words, the diseases of animals are 
an illusion in us. She forgets that the brute creation 
was here, suffering and dying, for countless ages be
fore the creation of man. She sticks to it that rats 
die of plague and guinea-pigs of phthisis because we 
dream of the germs of these diseases.
As she thinks of animals, so she thinks of babies. 
Over babies, at their birth, or soon after, she loves 
to voice the truth or to enjoy a pleasing demon
stration; and some of her results in this line might 
well engage the attention of the Society for the Pre
vention of Cruelty to Children.
She defends her failures by this argument, that 
mistakes, failures, and disasters occur in medical 
and surgical practice; and she says that some sur
geons are too fond of operating. This argument 
neither shortens the list of those who die of Chris
tian Science nor alters the fact that she sits, day 
after day, by cases of diphtheria, hemorrhage,cancer, 
strangulated hernia, intestinal obstruction, abscess, 
or abnormal labor, and never stirs a finger to help 
them; and will, at last, utter this brutal insult over 
the dfeadthat they died of want of faith. As for 
her statement about operating, I have net yet heard 
of a single case of appendix-abscess, in Christian 
Science, where the patient did not die; whereas the 
operation for the removal of the appendix, to pre
vent the risk of an abscess, has a morality of about
1 per cent.'Stephen Paget, P.R.C.S.
