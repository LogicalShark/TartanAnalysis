Lord Halifax Speaks ' 
At Founders Day 
Exercises Thursday
Following the established cus
tom, the annual Founders Day ex
ercises will be held in Carnegie 
Hall on Thursday evening, October 
8, at 8:15 P. M. In the past, 
Founders Day always signified the 
opening of the International Exhi
bition of Painting at the Carnegie 
Institute but, because of the war 
conditions, the Exhibition has been 
discontinued.
The guest speaker of the evening 
will be Lord Halifax, Ambassador 
from Great Britain to the United 
States since 1940. His topic has been
. . . Lord Halifax 
announced as, The Influence of Sci
entific Power in War. This speech 
will be broadcast over station 
WCAE from 8:30 to 8:45 P. M.
Bishop Mann, of the Protestant 
Episcopal, Church, will deliver the 
invocation for the exercises. Miss 
Margaret Daum, soprano of the 
Metropolitan Opera Society, will 
also be a guest of the evening. A 
former resident of Pittsburgh, she 
has often been referred to as the 
Brilliant American Lyric Soprano. 
Dr. Marshall Bidwell, of the Car
negie Music Hall, will play several 
selections on the organ.
After the exercises, the audience 
continued on page 5
Oct. 17th New Date 
For Military Ball
Scabbard and Blade, national R.
O. T. C. honorary, has announced 
that the date for the annual Mili
tary Ball has been changed from 
Saturday, October 10 to Saturday, 
October 17. The change was made 
to obtain Shep Fields and his new 
brassless orchestra.
In eliminating the brass and play
ing up the woodwinds, Shep has cre
ated a new kind of music that sat
isfies both smooth dancers and jit
terbugs. During the evening, the 
band is scheduled to make a nation
wide broadcast.
At the Ball, Scabbard and Blade 
will formally announce the names 
of its new pledges. The honorary 
girl cadets, chosen by the society, 
will also be made known.
War Stamp Booth 
Will Open Today In 
Administration Hall
Today in the Administration 
Building, the War Stamp Commit
tee of the Tech National Defense 
Council has opened a War Stamp 
Booth. To be at the disposal of 
both the students and the faculty on 
Tuesday and Fridays, this novel cre
ation will be run by a different or
ganization each week. This week 
the booth is being rim by the sopho
more girls honorary, the Cwens.
Those responsible for the booth 
include representatives of the Inter
sorority Council; the Inter-frater
nity Council; the Dragon Society, 
builders of the booth; the Womens 
Dorm Council; the Mens Dorm 
Council; and Dr. Chworowsky, spon
sor of the War Stamp Committee. 
In addition to the sale of stamps, 
there is to be a $25 War Bond to 
be awarded to the organization that 
sells the most stamps during the 
drive which will close concurrently 
with the first Semester, December 
19. One-third of the cost of this 
bond has been contributed by the 
Inter-fratemity council, and onethird, by the Mens Dorm Council.
Since there has long been a need 
for a War Stamp Sale on the cam
pus, the present drive is expected to 
be a great success. From the show
ing made by Pittsburghs Public 
Schools, Tech should do wonders; 
but this is possible only with the 
cooperation of the entire student 
body.

Freshman Classes of Engineering,

Kilties Journey 
As Titan Guests
By Dave Neuss 
The reason the Kiltie Band board
ed the train bound for New Wil
mington, Pa., last Saturday morn
ing was that the students of West
minister sent a special invitation 
stating: We would like your band 
to visit us on October 3 in order to 
add to the interest and excitement 
of the game between the Tartans 
and the Titans. If you accept, they 
added, we will pay all expenses 
of your trip. It seems that the 
fame of the Carnegie band is more 
renown than that of the Plaid gridders.
Wednesday night Chris Bauer 
had the Kilties drilling in the bowl 
from seven to ten-thirty. This was 
even before they knew whether 
the executive board would O. K. the 
trip at the special meeting they 
were to hold on Friday for that pur
pose. They drilled with their 
fingers crossed. (Quite a feat, es
pecially for the bagpipe players!)
The Kilties drilled from 9:30 till 
11:15 Saturday A. M. and after a 
half hour lunch period they march
ed to the stadium and be
gan their spectacular exhibition. 
Their entrance onto the field was 
in the form of a marching H-E-L-L 
with a revolving O to say, obvi
ously, hello to their hosts. Other 
trick formations skillfully execut
ed during the afternon were a mammouth V for victory and an army 
tank. Accompanying the Kilties 
was the military color guard, now 
a regular addition to the band.
It was a tired group that boarded 
the train for Pittsburgh at 9 oclock 
Saturday night; tired from playing, 
marching, and, as always, giving 
their whole-hearted support to the 
Tartan team. It was also a mighty 
thankful team; thankful to Dean 
Warden, Dean Murphy, and the rest 
of the executive board, and, of 
course, thankful to generous West
minster for making their trip possi
ble.
Probably one of the most unusual 
assemblies of the year will be held 
today at 11:30 in the Little Theater 
of Fine Arts Building. It will be 
of special interest to all students on 
the Carnegie campus, for it features 
five United Nations war heroes of 
student age. All the young men and 
women are in their early twenties.
This group includes representa
tives of Great Britain, the Nether
lands, China, and Russia, who came 
to the United States to attend the 
International Student Assembly in 
Washington, D. C., and who have 
visited colleges all over the United 
States. The five speakers are fam
ous in their own countries for their 
share in the war effort.
Captain Peter Cochrane, 23, of the 
Cameron Highlanders, graduate of 
Oxford and bearer of the Military 
Cross, has fought in Libya and 
Italian East Africa since Septem
ber, 1939.
Appointed a Knight of Orange of 
Nassau by Queen Wilhelmina, 
Paden Kadir, from Java, barely es
caped with his life when Java fell. 
He has been in the United States 
for several months where he is now 
attached to the Netherlands In
formation Service.
Miss Yung Wang, one of Chinas 
most popular movie and stage 
actresses, recently escaped from 
Hong Kong after being hunted by 
the Gestapo of Japan for several 
years. In 1937 she organized a 
drama corps with her friends and 
volunteered their service to the 
Army. She arrived in New York 
three weeks ago to continue her 
studies in drama and literature.
Russia is represented by two 
speakers. Nikolai Krasavchenko, 
leader of the Moscow Youth organ
ization, was taken prisoner by the 
Germans but managed to escape by 
travelling 250 miles over enemy oc
cupied territory. His colleague, 
Vladimir Pchelinstev was stationed 
on the Leningrad front for eleven 
months and for his valor and hero
ism was given the title of Hero of 
the Soviet Union.
Pittsburgh is planning to give 
these war heroes a grand welcome, 
and many plans have been made for 
their entertainment during their 
two-day stay here. On Tuesday 
morning they will be received joint
ly by Carnegie and Pitt reception

3THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, OCTOBER 6, 1942
*7(4e Aditosi'I AlmcUaisi
A New Policy
When we assumed the duties of the Editorship of the TARTAN, we 
had several ideas on how it might possibly be improved. Throughout 
the summer, we worked on the mechanical aspects of the paper, and 
judging from the compliments which we have received, we feel that we 
have done a good job in that respect.
However, the problem of improving the quality of the news mate
rial is one which has plagued us for some time. We believe that we have 
the solution, and we can definitely promise that the TARTAN will be a 
more interesting paper in future issues. To achieve this position, we wish 
to serve notice that, henceforth, we will stop printing a glorified bul
letin board. We are sure that the student body, which is paying $2,800 
a year to read the TARTAN, will support us in our move to improve the 
contents of the paper, and we would appreciate suggestions with that 
point in mind. Under our plan, the TARTAN will not be a newspaper, but 
a weekly periodical which will combine the important news events of 
the week with feature stories and personal columns. We also plan to run 
more pictures and cartoons, which we are sure will be of interest.
Speaking of college newspapers, we might take this opportunity to 
thank our fellow fourth-estaters of The Pitt News for their thought
fulness in providing copies of their paper to the Tech student body last 
Friday. We are sure that they were appreciated by all, but we should 
like to point out to the gentleman who was making football predictions 
that the Tech-Westminster game was not of the closely matched, highscoring variety which he predicted. We might also add a few words on 
the journalistic quality of The News, but as we have said, we are hardly 
in a position to throw stones.
To Illustrate A Point
Last weeks front page editorial entitled Engineers Are Not Ex
empt drew some praise and a great deal of criticism from the student 
body. Many students came to us and asked what was meant by the 
country club attitude which the writer of the editorial stated was prom
inent on this campus. The following item will, we think, serve as a 
perfect example:
One of the more noisy bores-about-campus made the statement that he 
was not going to shave until Stalingrad fell. This was a few weeks ago 
and needless to say, the half-wit has since shaved many times. This is the 
same individual who has boasted of the fact that he enlisted in a branch 
of the service which was certain to be of a non-combat, land-based nature. 
We might suggest that this same person attend todays assembly and listen 
to Vladimir Pchelintsev who might give him some lessons on how to go for 
weeks without shavingand how to kill 152 Nazis at the same time. How
ever, we are wasting good spaceat 11:30 today the moron will probably 
be in Skibo, telling the campus-queens-to-be of his latest exploits in the 
field of romance.
The Campus Political Scene
Politically prominent Independents, who should know, tell us that the 
TARTAN is now a fraternity paper, and that they are very much dis
gusted with us. We are happy to have our political platform settled in 
such easy fashion, but we might inform these gentlemen that they are 
slightly in error. We are independent of both Independents and Frater
nities, but like Superman, we are interested in seeing justice and fair 
play prevail. We wont tip our hand, but we should like to say that we 
do not believe that the present fraternity system of insuring complete 
fraternity vote is either fair or in keeping with official White Book 
regulations.
We were very much interested in an editorial which appeared in the 
first issue of The Citcommentatorofficial organ of the Citcom Clan. 
The editorial, Citcom In Politics, presented a viewpoint which fraternity 
men might think about. It ran, . . . With most of the student activities 
now safely under the supervision of the administration, Citcoms best 
course is to withdraw from the political scene. It is to be hoped that by 
releasing our members from the necessity of voting the straight Inde
pendent ticket, we might at the same time release the fraternity group 
from the necessity of their strong political organization, and the day 
might soon come when all Tech students may vote for the best men, 
regardless of party affiliation.
Opinions expressed in the pages of the TARTAN are those of the members of the 
staff; in the case of the editorial column they are those of the Editor. They are not 
to be construed as necessarily the opinions of either the student body or the faculty.

one of the boys
Bill Newman
Bill Newman is a very active 
jolly management engineer. For 
those of you who dont know the 
laymans classification of this par
ticular species he is, in the words 
of his fellow engineers, a slappy 
senior. The bulk of our interview 
with him concerned his major ac
tivity, his brand new wife, the for
mer Jane Allen of Pittsburgh.
Janie can cook three meals, which 
they eat in monotonous rotation, but 
now that she has stopped working 
they will probably have four differ
ent meals. She might even learn 
to make Bills favorite dish, apple 
pie a la mode. He could always aid 
in production by trotting down to 
the corner drug store for the ice 
cream.
Bill has been a member of Scim
itars, Delta Skull, Glee Club, and 
the Kiltie Band. He left the band 
after three years of drumming be
cause he wanted to see the games, 
of at least his last year, With his 
trousers on. He is a Major in ROTC, 
a member of Scabbard and Blade, 
the Y Cabinet, and is publicity man
ager of the Technical. Techs Cir
cle of ODK elected him president, 
which brings his presidencies to a 
grand total of two; for Bill is also 
the president of the Kappa Sig 
House.
The Newman household promises 
to be extremely musical, what with 
Janies piano played after her own 
fashion and Bills drum played 
after the Kiltie fashion. His hobbying besides hubbying is photog
raphy. With all of this outside ac
tivity, we wonder how he finds time 
to attend school, or, better still,
why he doesnt exercise some of his 
powers and institute a thirty-six 
hour day.

Septa Sanderson Draws Praise In 
Pride and Prejudice Opening
It is not with the carefully school
ed eye of a George Jean Nathan or 
a John Mason Brown that we pre
sent our review of the first play 
in the Drama Departments 1942-3 
season. We boast of not one iota 
of technical knowledge, but we do 
know what pleases us as just one 
other spectator who jams the Arts 
Theater a full three quarters of an 
hour before the play begins, merely 
to sit in the center section, which, 
because of the sight lines, offers the 
only good view.
Robert Gills first Tech produc
tion, Pride and Prejudice, is an 
excellent beginning for the seasons 
schedule. He seems to endow 
his actors with an excellent sense 
of pantomime which we have not 
observed heretofore. We speak in 
particular of the scene in which 
Elizabeth, of whom we will speak 
later, refuses Mr. Collins suit. Miss 
Sanderson, in the part of Lizzie, 
deftly held the eyes of the audience 
with nothing more than an occa
sional pout or grimaceheld it 
against the groveling, twittering, 
swaying Mr. Collins, interpreted, 
shall we say, by Richard Rose?
Which brings us very neatly to 
the most painful part of our review.

ances among the principals, we 
were irked considerably by several 
passages; in general, instead of 
characters, we were treated, in 
many cases, to caricatures. Nota
bly, Mrs. Bennet, Mr. Collins, Mr. 
Wickham, Lady Catherine, and 
Colonel Fitzwilliam. We like 
sharply drawn characterizations, 
but oh, that broad gesture, that leer, 
that growl . . .
A striking performance, without 
any qualifying statements, was Miss 
Sanderson's. She looked the part, 
sounded the part, and, in spite of 
slightly eurythmic surroundings, 
moved the part. We were impress
ed also by Robert Parks as Mr. Bennet, an excellent foil, for his wifes 
cadenzas. James Schmitt, as Darcy 
was good, though his restraint al
most touched surliness. Jean Gra
ham as Miss Bingley, and Christo
pher Smith as her brother was ex
cellent, as was Paqueline Valaskamp, as Jane Bennet, whose big 
scene in the second act, admirably 
handeled, was spoiled by one of the 
grosser members of the opening 
night night audience.

Tech Tackles Case 
At Stadium Saturday; 
Skibos Are Underdogs
Next week the Tartan grid squad 
again tries their luck in Pitt Sta
dium on Saturday afternoon, Octo
ber 10. This time their opponents 
will be the scrappy Case Scientists, 
who doled out a 27-0 beating to the 
Tech lads last" year on a mud-soak
ed field in Cleveland. The Case out
fit is noted for their hard clean foot
ball, and for their excellent spirit.
A large number of lettermen are 
back from last years team, which 
was only beaten once. Included 
in these men are Jack Niederhauser, 
diminutive but dynamic All-Ohio 
guard of last year, and Mel Wheel
wright, class of Cleveland fullbacks 
last year. Also a goodly number of 
last years freshman team are back; 
this frosh squad was considered to 
be one of the best in the history of 
the school.
Last Saturday Case defeated the 
Iowa Seahawks 6-0; the Seahawks 
are the Iowa Naval Pre-flight 
Training School and are coached by 
Bernie Bierman, former head of the 
Minnesota Gophers. Although Case 
played the B squad of the Sea
hawks, the only assurance they had 
concerning the game was that pro
fessional players would not be used 
against them. This made it two 
straight for the Scientists this sea
son.
If Tech plays the same kind of ball 
they did last Saturday against West
minster, the game should be close.

Varsity Swimming
Two weeks ago practice for the 
swimming team began under the 
supervision of Coach Risedorph, but 
it is still not too late to try out for 
the team. Coach Risedorph has been 
giving the men supervised calis
thenics to get them in shape, so very 
little swimming practice has been 
done. Since the first meet is not 
until the second week in January, 
the team will not be chosen for sev
eral months, so there is still a good 
chance to make the team this year.

After last weeks drab loss in

by Westminster last year, the Tar
tan varsity grid squad evened up a 
few old scores by rolling over West
minster College 26-0 last Saturday

ing some of the Skibo pep and pow
er of old, the lads exhibited a

whelmed the Westminster Titans.
The most heartening feature of 
the game, however, was the pres
ence of zip and fight, which were so 
sadly lacking in the opening game, 
on the part of the Tartans. Revers
ing the picture of the previous 
game with Geneva, the Techites 
had no case of nerves, for it was 
evident after the first quarter that 
the boys had decided to win one. 
In fact, they proceeded to prove to 
themselves that they were a ball 
club full of scrap.
The fire-works started in the first 
quarter when MacLaughlin took a 
Titan punt on his 35 yard stripe and 
then alternated with Pash to carry 
the ball down to scoring territory 
via the end-run route. Byers then 
bucked it over for the score, and the 
try for the extra point was missed. 
Here the score stood at 6-0 until the 
fourth quarter, when Tech showed 
real power by marching the length 
of the field to score on a line buck 
by Philipchuk with the aid of the 
hard charging Tartan lihe, which 
literally tore a gaping hole in the 
Titan forward wall. MacLaughlin 
converted the extra point.
Then later in the quarter Reid 
Byers began to boom through the 
line for long gains and carried the 
ball personally over for the third 
score. In the closing minutes of the 
game Duke Brown intercepted a 
Titan pass on their 43 yard line, 
headed downfield, and scored stand
ing up with the aid of some fine 
down-field blocking by the Skibo 
linemen. The failure to convert the 
extra point ended the game with 
Tech on the long end of a 26-0 count.

Beta Sigs, Pi KAs, Citcom Lead 
In Intramural Football Program
By Hal
The past week has seen plenty of 
fur flying on the Cut as the intra
mural touch football leagues enter
ed their second week of competi
tion. This year the reputations of 
the once-upon-a-time good teams 
have been thrown to the high winds 
and it looks like a grand and glor
ious year for the underdogs.
Outstanding has been the per
formance of the Beta Sigma Rho 
team in one of the fraternity 
leagues. To date they are unde
feated. On Monday, September 
28th, they took the Kappa Sigs for 
a ride to the tune of 16 to 10. Last 
Friday they set the Tau Delts back 
on their heels by an 18 to 7 score. 
Considering the score of the Kappa 
Sig-Tau Delt game of two weeks 
ago, which the Clyde Streeters won 
51 to 9, this was a rather poor show
ing on the part of the Beta Sigs. 
Manager Brinn, however, attribut
ed the narrow margin of victory to 
the fact that he used everybody but
Hartlieb
the water boy in the contest. Brinn 
and George Marck, the latter a star 
freshman basketball player of last 
year, have proved to be the spark 
which has put the Beta Sig team on 
the road to victory.
In the same league are the Phi 
Kaps who are also undefeated. In 
the estimation of many, however, 
they have yet to play the tough 
teams, and the coming week may 
tell a different story. In their only 
game of the past week they defeat
ed the Tau Delts, 18 to 11. Hennessy has been doing all the passing 
for the team while Bob DeBortoli 
has been on the receiving end a 
good bit of the time. On Tuesday, 
October 6th, the Phi Kaps are 
scheduled to trade blows with the 
Beta Sigs. The winner of this game 
will be the only remaining unde
feated team that league and will 
probably go on to the finals.
Two other games in the same 
league featured the ATOs versus

Friday. The ATOs won both of 
these games, the first by a score of 
10 to 1, and the second by an 11 
to 8 tally.
PiKA-Delt Thriller
Probably the toughest game of 
the year was played by the PiKAs 
last Tuesday when they defeated 
the Delts by the very slim margin 
of one point. The final score stood 
at 12 to 11. This was a hard won 
and a hard lost game for the two 
teams, the victorious squad being 
the one which got the most breaks. 
The starting team for the PiKAs 
consisted of Duchene and Gregorius 
at the end positions, Reisacher at 
center, Armouh and Richards as 
half-backs, and Hofmann in the tail
back spot. Wetzel, Dolan, Lindstrom, and Warfel saw action as 
substitutes. With Hofmann as the 
passer and Duchene as the receiver, 
a good many gains were made. 
Highlighting the game, however, 
was the offensive blocking by 
Richards, Armour, and Dolan. Poor 
officiating did not improve relations 
between the two teams.
Right now the independent league
looks like a good game of squirrelin-the-cage. The Citcoms have a 
good team as usual, but the Dorms 
keep knocking one another off so 
fast that no one team can be tabbed 
the best. Scobell was slated as hav
ing a good team, but they lost to 
the Citcoms on Wednesday, 17 to 11. 
On the same day Boss defeated 
Welch, 17 to 1, while Henderson was 
drubbed by the Zoot Suits, 27 to 0. 
Earlier in the week McGill and the 
Zoot Suits played to a 5 to 5 tie.
Two games which were postpon
ed in the first week of the play-offs 
have been definitely scheduled. 
Boss Hall will play the Zoots on 
Monday, October 5th, while Welch 
will play the Citcom Friday.

8THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, OCTOBER 6, 1942
Council Sets Group Election For 
October 17th In Exhibition Hall
On Saturday evening, October 
17th, at eight P. M., the three eve
ning colleges, Engineering, Fine 
Arts and Industries join together in 
staging a combined election in the 
Exhibition Room of the Fine Arts 
Building.
The combining of the heretofore 
announced separate elections into 
one huge party was done to save 
time and money, a shortage of 
which resulted in the large drop in 
enrollment. It was also done in an 
effort to give the council sufficient 
time to encourage participation in 
these elections by the entire stu
dent body.
War effort and the draft have cut 
deeply into the potential active 
group and many of those who have 
been active in previous years are 
now absent from the campus.
Industries college which always 
had the largest enrollment on the 
evening school campus in previous 
years has had a drastic decrease in 
its numbers. The busy engineers 
now outnumber the Arts and Indus
tries combined.
To cope with the shortage of stu
dent workers, the individual college 
dances held in previous years, 
which were free to the students en
rolled in that particular college have 
been combined into what is termed 
the All-College-Dance. Two of 
these dances are scheduled for this 
semester and admission will be 
upon presentation of the registra
tion card.
Eligibility for council offices has 
been changed. The major require
ments are three hours attendance 
per week, passing grade of D or 
better in the previous year and to 
have earned a council activities key. 
The other rules are much the same 
as those that appeared in last years 
Handbook and will be printed more 
in detail in the next issue.
All evening students are urged 
to come out for the election. If the 
best gal or wife doesnt want to be 
left alone that evening, bring her 
along with you. The same rule ap
plies to the girls and their boy
friends.
There will be entertainment, 
dancing and refreshments. Above 
all, remember to bring along your 
registration card as you will need 
it for admission and to secure a bal
lot at voting time..
Dance Is Postponed
The Annual Nu Sigma Alpha 
Dance which is to be held on Octo

Student Council 
Awards Insignia
When the new school year rolls 
around, workers on the campus look 
forward to two events. One is Reg
istration and the other is the An
nual Insignia Award Dinner. This 
year the two came almost simul
taneously, with the eighteenth An
nual Insignia Award Dinner being 
held August 31, 1942 in the PennLincoln Hotel. This dinner is held 
each year by Evening Student 
Council and it is then that Insignia 
Awards are given for meritorious 
work in extra-curricular activities 
on the Evening School Campus.
The attendance at the dinner this 
year was smaller than in previous 
years because of our men in the 
service and in certain defense in
dustries, but the administration 
showed their interest in our activ
ities by coming out en masse. The 
guests from the administration in
cluded President Doherty, Dean of 
Students Warden, Deans Yon and 
Murphy, Major Stanton, Mr. Shaf
fer and Mr. McKelway.
The Activities Scholarships were 
awarded this year to Albert Flan
ders of Engineering and Robert 
Edelman of Industries.
Council is reserving a place for 
you at the next Banquet. Why not 
come out and occupy it?

season, to run from October first to 
eighth. This production is under 
the able direction of Professor Rob

No doubt many of you are fa

by Jane Austen and we are sure that 
the interpretation of this tale of 
comedy and romance by the Little 
Theater group will be both inter
esting and amusing.
Tickets for the presentation may

desire to attend this performance, 
you secure tickets at once as there 
is usually a great demand for them.
