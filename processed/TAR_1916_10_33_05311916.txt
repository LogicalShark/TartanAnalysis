EINANGAE STATEMENT Of THE STUDENT 
ACTIVITIES BOARD, SEASON I9I5I9I6
At the completion of the years work, and before passing to the incom
ing Boards the task of attending to the business of the school year 1916-17, 
the Student Activities Board and the Athletic Association wish to submit to 
the Student Body a statement of the work of the different organizations, of 
their expenses, receipts and assets with the hope that, with a better under
standing of the situation, the student body at large will take a keener inter
est in the affairs of the different activities and exhibit more enthusiasm in 
their support, as well as more intelligence in their criticisms.
The different boards, acting as trustees for a just and proper disposition 
of the funds furnished by the Student Body for its activities, and desirous 
of meeting its tasks to the satisfaction of all concerned has endeavored this 
year to organize all activities on a business basis and thinks that it has suc
ceeded in its endeavors. It realizes, however, that the full benefit to the 
school and to the student body resulting from a healthy growth of the differ
ent activities will be reaped only through the active interest of the student 
body at large in the organizations which its own money creates and main
tains. To stimulate such an interest a statement of the Assets and Liabilities 
of the different organizations is appended.

Beta Theta Epsilon Successful in Pe
titioning National Fraternity.
Word has been received from the 
officers of the Sigma Nu fraternity 
that a charter has been granted by 
that organization to the Beta Theta 
Epsilon fraternity of Carnegie Tech. 
The entrance of such a fraternity as 
Sigma Nu at Tech is of considerable 
significance, inasmuch as it is indica
tive that a stamp of approval has 
been placed upon the school by col
lege men throughout the country.
The Sigma Nu fraternity was found
ed at the Virginia Military Institute 
on January 1, 1869. The growth of 
the fraternity gradually spread 
through the South and West coming 
north across the Mason and Dixon 
line, and placing chapters in such 
schools as Lehigh, Lafayette, Colum
bia, Cornell, Syracuse, Dartmouth, 
Maine, Brown, and Penn State.
The membership of the fraternity is 
now approximately 13,000, and main
tains 73 chapters, of which 33 own 
their own houses, representing an in
vestment of $500,000. Forty-eight 
alumni chapters have been established 
throughout the country, one of the 
most active of which is located in 
Pittsburgh.
The Sigma Nu fraternity is divided 
into seventeen geographical divisions. 
The new chapter at Carnegie Tech 
will become a member of the fifth 
division, including the states of 
Ohio, West Virginia, and Western 
Pennsylvania. The colleges in this 
division are Bethany, Ohio State, Mt. 
Union, West Virginia, Case, and 
Western Reserve.

BIDS WILL BE CALLED FOR ON 
STADIUM.
Bureau of Building Construction Com
plete Plans.
Requests for bids on a portion of 
the new athletic field are to be sent 
out next week. The part of the stand 
upon which bids are asked is only 
a fraction of the whole, and will seat 
perhaps four thousand people. The 
construction of even that small sec
tion, however, is still very uncertain 
because of the high cost of building 
materials. Although the structure is 
to be of concrete, yet the price of 
steel for reinforcing might raise the 
cost to a prohibitive amount. If for
tune should favor Tech, the program 
will be something like this: Bids
will be in within the course of a 
month. The trustees of the InstiContinued on Page 6

The Choral Club Makes Its First Ap
pearance in Opera.
(Editors Note: This communication
is a dramatic criticism.)
On Thursday evening, May 25, the 
Choral Club, composed of students 
from the four schools, gave its 
maiden performance in light opera on 
the stage of the Design School The
ater.
The performance was an agreeable 
surprise to those who had been fol
lowing up the rehearsals and to 
those who were beating this raw ma
terial into shape. The Sunday after
noon previous not even the most 
optimistic could have hoped for suc
cess: it was confusion worse con
founded. The principals did not 
know their parts, the orchestra was 
battling with unreadable manuscript 
and the chorus did not appear to 
know its right hand from its left. 
Pooh-Bah, in the person of Otto 
Olsen, was the only person who 
came serenely on and went serenely 
off in the right placenot even dis
turbed by Mr. Cowleys desperate ef
forts to make him appear like the 
Lord High Everything-elsein 
other words, to make him hold his 
head upbut even that was achieved 
by Thursday night, and a lopsided 
mustache utterly failed, on that oc
casion, to disturb his highness se
renity. Mr. Olsen is restful: one felt 
sure of him and knew that to him 
it mattered not, how the orchestra 
played or what the chorus didhe 
would get there, *nd he didnot 
suddenly, but surely.
It was only Tuesday evening that 
the proper orchestral scores arrived, 
but nothing daunted, Mr. OBrien 
went determinedly on, beating it in 
upon (other) weary brains, with his 
baton and succeeded in bringing or
der out of chaos. The Thursday night 
performance was more carefully sung 
but the Friday performance had more 
spontaneity.
The mens chorus sang with vim 
and spirit, while the womens chorus 
was commendable for clean, clear 
tone and good ensemble. Both did 
credit to Mr. Webers careful train
ing and acquitted themselves credit
ably. The most important female 
role (in point of difficulty) was suc
cessfully sung by Miss Olive Slingluff as Katisha. She has a contralto 
voice of some power and possesses 
unquestionable dramatic ability. She 
does not forget that she is but an in
tegral part of a dramatic whole and 
has a conductor to follow. Her work 
Friday night was particularly clever 
and excruciatingly funny.
Yum-Yum was very acceptably 
sung by Miss Barbara Welty, who is 
the possessor of a clear soprano voice 
of light quality, while Miss Beatrice 
Heinrich as PStti-Sing and Miss 
Nita Cease as Peep-Bo, completed 
the very charming trio of the three 
little maids from school.
In Ko-Ko, Lord High Execu
tioner, Mr. Howard Hoffman, found 
an excellent opportunity to display 
his histrionic ability. He possesses 
a voice well adapted to the role. He 
is essentially a reader and held the
interest of his audience to the last 
line. The Friday night house howled 
with delight over his pathetic song 
of Lit-Willowno wonder that 
Katisha capitulated: it would have 
melted a heart of stone. They were 
both above the average in this per
formance and met with rounds of ap
plause.
Mr. J. Steele Jamison has an agree
able tenor voice and made an inter
esting Nanki-Poo, entering into the 
dramatic situations with spirit. His 
duet with Yum-Yum met with a 
most cordial reception.
Fred L. Sharpe as Pish-Tush, re
vealed one of the best voices in the 
cast and sang that role with ease.
Mr. Wm. F. Mulligans voice may 
be forgiven on the principle that the 
king can do no wrong, and he made 
a very entertaining Mikado. That 
his crown was not made to measure, 
became most evident on Friday night 
and excited considerable interest and 
speculation as to whether it would 
stay in place when he came to that 
high jumpbut he balanced it per
fectlya feat not to be despised.
Mr. Fredric McConnell as SwordBearer to Ko-Ko moved about 
with his usual agilitywhile Mr. Coe 
as protector of the royal cranium, 
succeeded in keeping that diminutive 
umbrella over the active head of the 
Mikado.
The stage setting was especially at
tractivethe lighting good. The cos
tuming of the men was very pleasing 
to the eye, but the womens chorus 
was too spotty and confusing in color 
the costumes failed either to blend 
or to contrast.
All things considered, the Choral 
Club and everyone connected with 
this production of The Mikado may 
feel that it was a surprising success 
for a first ventureand a delighted 
audience expressed the hope to hear 
from this organization again in simi
lar fashion. A Student.
AIR INFECTION DUE TO 
SPEAKING.
Interesting Experiment Carried On 
By Students in the Department 
of Sanitary Engineering.
Interesting experiments, dealing 
with the subject of air infection, due 
to speaking, were recently conducted 
by D. V. Shervan, 17, and G. E. 
Wright, 17, students in the Sanitary 
Engineering course, under the direc
tion of Mr. Rush. The following is 
an account of the nature of the ex
periment and the results determined.
Sanitarians are now convinced that 
the important factor in the spread of 
most diseases is direct contact, and 
that air infection compared with con
tact infection is nearly negligible in 
the disseminaton of pathogenic micro
organisms. They do not, however, 
neglect the importance of certain food 
stuffs and water as carriers of disease 
germs, but in the fonowing work we 
are concerned chiefly with a type of 
micro-organism dissemination which 
might be considered to be mid-way 
between contact infection (that is, di
rect contact with the infected indi
vidual) and true air borne infection
(in which type, the organism pos
sessed the ability of remaining viru
lent for sometime though exposed to 
sunlight and dessication); the socalled droplet infection or infection 
by means of the minute particle of 
saliva emitted from the mouth of the 
infected individual and propelled 
through the air as in coughing or 
sneezing. During ordinary conversa
tion, reading, or lecturing, the pro
nunciation of certain consonants, as 
t, d, and z is also accompanied by a 
considerable amount of this mouth 
spray, which from an individual in
fected with any disease, the causative 
agent of which is in the sputum at the 
time in question, forms a distinct 
menace to the health of susceptible 
individuals within radius of this cur
tain of spray. It becomes, therefore, 
highly important to ascertain the dis
tance to which organisms may be pro
pelled from the mouth of an indi
vidual, thus determining what might 
be called a Danger Zone about such 
a potential source of infection. With 
this in view the following experiment 
was undertaken.
Ten cubic centimeters of sterile 
water were infected with a pure cul
ture of Bacillus prodigiosus and this 
suspension of the organism was thor
oughly rinsed about in the mouth of 
the experimenter and then discarded, 
thus leaving the mouth in its normal 
condition so far as the quantity of 
its liquid content was concerned. This 
organism was selected because it is 
non-pathogenic to the human being 
and for the further reason that it 
forms a bright red pigment and would 
therefore be easily recognized later 
in making the examination for its 
presence. It may seem that the con
dition of the experiment gave us a 
preponderance of the test organism 
in the mouth of the experimenter, but 
it must be remembered that the 
mouth cavity has a very high bacterial 
content and it is quite possible that 
the number of test organisms used 
in the experiment did not bear a 
greater relation to the total number 
of bacteria in the mouth than would 
obtain in certain disease conditions, 
as for example diphtheria, tuberculo
sis, or pneumonia.
With the mouth prepared as above 
described, the experimenter stood at 
a table on which were spread out di
rectly before him, at intervals of one 
foot, seven uncovered glass dishes 
three inches in diameter, the bottom 
of which were covered with nutrient 
agar (a material upon which micro
organisms grow readily). Assuming 
a tone slightly above the pitch of or
dinary conversation, the experimenter 
read at random from a book for ten 
minutes, during which time he was 
directly facing the uncovered glass 
(Petrie dishes) plates. These dishes 
were left uncovered for ten minutes 
after the experimenter had finished 
reading, in order to allow the lighter 
particles of saliva to settle thereon. 
Any organisms from the mouth which 
alighted upon the nutrient material in 
the Petrie dishes would on incubation 
at a suitable temperature grow and 
form a so-called colony which would 
be visible to the naked eye. Those

TENNIS TEAM DEFEATS GROVE 
CITY.
Match With Pitt Results in Tie. 
Tech Men Show Good Form.
The tennis team continued its win
ning streak by defeating Grove City 
on their courts last week. Beatty 
won his letter when he and Murphy 
took the doubles match from Hill 
and Baird in easy fashion. Capt. 
Davis put up his usual brand of net 
work and stopped Hill, 6-0, 6-0.
We divided both the doubles and 
singles with Pitt, much to the disap
pointment of the players on both 
sides. Davis again showed his cal
ibre as a tennis player, by taking the 
first two sets from Spindles, inciden
tally winning the honor of adminis
tering the first defeat of the season 
to the Pitt crack. Beatty won his 
singles and put up a game fight in 
the doubles, his work in these match
es being the feature of the contest.

THREE RECORDS SHATTERED.
Hemman and Adams Hang Up New 
Figures.
During the past season two new 
marks have been made in field events 
and one on the cinder path. Jake 
Adams still continues to reign su
preme in this select sport,he started 
by breaking the shot put record in 
the Inter-School Meet and then went 
up to Allegheny and duplicated the 
feat, this time with a heave of 39 
feet 2 inches. His most remarkable 
performance was at the Bethany meet 
last Saturday, when he stepped on to 
a muddy field and threw the discus 
114 feet Ya inches, bettering the old 
mark by one-quarter inch.
The only track record to go by the 
boards this year is the quarter mile, 
which Hemman lowered to 50 3-5 
seconds at the Pitt meet. This clips 
one-fifth second from the former time, 
and equals the best performance of 
Burwell, Pitts flyer.
Secretary Field was a member of 
the four-day extension trade trip into 
Ohio, which was made last week un
der the management of the Pittsburgh 
Champer of Commerce.
TECH DROPS ANOTHER TO 
PITT, 6 TO 1.
Game Fast and Well Played. Hines 
Pitches.
That second game of the series was 
won by Pitt in rather easy fashion. 
Pitt opened fire in the first in such 
a manner as to get two tallies. After 
getting the jump on Tech the Blue 
and Gold score was never endangered. 
Pitcher Kennedy of Pitt allowed only 
six scattered hits and fanned seven 
men. Zehfuss, Yeager, and Molner 
were the only ones able to solve his 
attack, each one getting two hits. 
Yeager, as usual, had his two-bagger. 
Late in the game Tech replaced Hines 
with Wean. Hastings played a stellar 
game both in the field and at fyat. 
DeHart also starred in the latter de
partment. His home run was one of 
the most brilliant features of the 
game. The score:

KENYON COX LECTURES.
Noted Artist Talks To Students in 
Illustration and Painting.
Mr. Kenyon Cox, of New York, 
noted mural artist and decorator, 
gave a brief lecture to the students 
of illustration, painting and decora
tion last Thursday afternon in the 
Design School.
Mr. Cox is the creator of several fa
mous mural paintings in different 
state capitols throughout the country 
and is one of the greatest exponents 
of classicism in this country. He was 
brought to Pittsburgh and Carnegie 
Tech under the auspices of the Hew
lett Foundation.
KISKI TAKES HONORSTECH 
DEFEATS BETHANY.
Wet Track Prevents Fast Time. Two 
Field Records Made.
The weather man did his best to 
stop the meet Saturday, but the au
thorities insisted in starting the meet. 
Two hard rain and thunder showers 
made the track a lake of mud. This 
of course was absolutely prohibitive 
of fast time.
In spite of all this two new field 
records were established. Hemington 
of Kiski cleared the bar at 6 ft 3-10 
inches and made a new Western 
Pennsylvania Scholastic record. Ad
ams of Tech heaved the discus 114 
ft. 7 1-4 in. and thereby knocked out 
Clairs old record of 114 ft. 1-4 in. 
Adams, by the way, scored four firsts 
and a second place. Hemman and 
Moore had two first places apiece. 
Tech literally swamped Bethany, 107 
to 19. Kiski did not take long in 
pushing to the front, especially in 
the field events. The points were 
distributed as follows:

all the pages of Techs athletic his
tory, you will search in vain for a 
record to eclipse that held by this 
versatile performance on the field and 
cinders. Jake is a very quiet fel
lowhed never tell what hes done 
and so we wish to summarize briefly 
his career as a member of our track 
team.
Last year he led all his teammates 
in the total number of points scored. 
In the Pitt Dual Meet he was the 
only Plaid entrant in the field events 
and put up a game fight against their 
team.
This year he again leads in total 
number of points, by a big margin, 
and well deserves the reputation of 
our most consistent point winner. He 
has broken three school recordsthe 
shot put, in the Interschool Meet, and 
at Allegheny; the discus, in the Beth
any Meet last Saturday. In this lat
ter contest he also placed first in the 
high hurdles, low hurdles, hammer 
throw and discus, and took second in 
the shot put, a total of 23 points.
To say that the Bethany team is in 
a class with our star is putting it too 
mildly,his is a class by itself.
GROVE CITY AGAIN DEFEATED
Tennis Team Celebrates Memorial 
Day.
Grove City suffered their second 
defeat at the hands of our tennis 
team on the Trafford City courts last 
Tuesday, the result being 4-2. The 
feature of the match was the playing 
of Jack Meredith, both in the sin
gles and doubles. Davis lost to McAmie in his singles match, but came 
back strong,-he iand J&ck carried 
Niece and McAmie off their feet in 
the doubles to the tune of 6-0, 6-1.
Murphy won his sweater when he 
beat Kiester in a decisive fashion, 
6-1, 6-3. Bob Spring played his first 
net game for Tech, and showed up 
well. He forced Cameron to three 
deuce sets in the singles and put up 
a fine band of tennis in the doubles, 
he and Muxp'h beating Cameron 
and Kiester in two exciting sets. 
Summaries:

Throughout the whole contest, the

their final victory. Perhaps the base
ball game was one of the most inter
esting events, Miss Morrow making 
an especially good umpire. It was 
too bad more of the girls did not 
make an effort to get out and see the 
meet, as it would probably have revived some of that much-to-be-desired, 
article called school spirit.
The active and alumni members of 
the Delta Theta Sorority were guests 
on Saturday, May 27th, of the Mises

The Dean talked very nicely to the 
girls, giving the Seniors their due 
praise and making several announce
ments, one of which was the award
ing of the Alpha Delta scholarship of 
$50 to Miss Abigail Kerr. Miss Kerr

INTER-CLUB SOCIAL SPLEN
DID AFFAIR.
Applied Industries Organizations 
Hold Dance in Carnegie 
Union.
Hie combined clubs of the Indus
tries School held their first InterClub dance Thursday of last week 
when about seventy-five couples represerving the Tech Mechanics, Teach
ers, Building Construction, Avo, 
Graphica, and P. M. O. clubs gather
ed in Carnegie Union and romped 
away an evening never to be forgot
ten for its splendid social spirit. The 
dance wos the best of the year and 
very fittingly ended up the 1915-16 
All Industries social activities. At 
eleven oclock, A. J. Baird of the 
Graphica, and chairman of the com
mittee in charge of the dance, an
nounced that according to the Dance 
Order an intermission would then be 
called. His announcement met the 
general approval of the sweltering 
dancers. The plenteous supply of 
ice cream and cakes together with the 
good punch served throughout the 
evening aided materially in making 
the dance a success in spite of the 
high mercury.
An appropriate dance order with 
a cover cut of the Industries Group 
executed especially for the occasion 
by the printing department helped 
the gay trippers keep tab of the many 
catchy one-step and fox-trot strains 
which the five-piece orchestra sent 
echoing over the campus. Following 
the production of the Mikado by the 
Choral Club in the Design Building, 
numerous theatre-goers peeped in 
and enjoyed the balance of the even
ings dancing, and at one oclock the 
seasons most enjoyable and success
ful affair came to a happy close.
SEANNACHIE ELECTIONS.
R. W. Cost, C. F. Peters, and J. R.
Hoxworth Chosen.
The Seannachie, an all-school Hon
orary Society anounced three Indus
tries men as new members. Roscoe 
W. Cost, Senior President, Carl F. 
Peters, Student Assembly President, 
and J. Russell Hoxworth, Middle 
Class President were the men elected. 
A recent amendment of the Constitu
tion of the Seannachie provides that 
the Industries Assembly President, 
by virtue of his office, shall automa
tically become a member and so 
Ralph Merker, president-elect for 
1916-17 is also honored as a Seanna
chie man. Hoxworth was chosen 
Seannachie vice-president for next 
year.

Carnegie Tech Drawings Win Com
mendation.
The exhibition of the Association 
of Collegiate Schools in Architecture 
in the Exhibition Room of Design 
School, was concluded Friday even
ing.
Among the schools represented and 
belonging to the Association were 
Universities of Pennsylvania, Cornell, 
Columbia, Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology, Carnegie Institute of 
Technology, University of Illinois 
and Harvard University.
Among the drawings attracting 
most attention were those from Co
lumbia, Cornell, Carnegie Tech, Bos
ton Tech and Pennsylvania.
Carnegie Techs exhibit was also 
the subject of exceptional interest in 
Washington last December when 
shown before the convention of the 
American Institute of Architects.
The Class Day Committee has the 
following announcement to make rel
ative to Class Day spreads.
Following the -usual custom, 
spreads can be given in the school 
buildings on Class Day this year. The 
Administrative Council has placed at 
the disposal of the Class Day Com
mittee a large number of room fac
ing the campus.
Any fraternity, sorority, club, or 
other group of students that wishes 
to entertain its guests by giving a 
spread on the campus should notify 
the chairman of the undersigned com
mittee not later than June 1st, stat
ing what building and what room is 
preferred. Assignments will then be 
made by the the committee.
All of the Class Day events this 
year have been scheduled for the cam
pus, it being the aim of the commit
tee to make the campus the center of 
Class Day activities, and provide a 
varied program of entertainment for 
the guests of the day. The introduc
tion of the spreads plan makes it 
possible for guests and students to re
main on the grounds throughout tht 
afternoon and evening.
The committee earnestly asks the 
co-operation of the seniors in this 
plan.

tute will then act upon the matter, 
and if they approve, work will be 
begun at once. The section should 
be finished in time for the fall sea
son.
Such good fortune is, however, 
rather unlikely. The whole matter 
of the bridge, the gymnasium and 
the stadium is up in the airaway up 
in the air. Mr. Chalfant, of the Bu
reau of Building Construction, said, 
We are going ahead with working 
drawings of the gym, and meanwhile 
all we can do in regard to the stad
ium is to hope for the best. The 
stadium when completed will be an 
immense concrete structure without 
ornamentunless perhaps the iron 
railing around it might be called an 
ornamentbut for all that, a truly 
wonderful structure, quite in keeping 
with the rest of our splendid build
ings.
NEW SCHEDULE OF FEES AN
NOUNCED.
Students Note Slight Change.
A new schedule of student fees, for 
day course only, becomes effective 
September 1st, 1916, superseding the 
schedules which appear in the 1915-
1916 catalog. This increase affects 
the general fee only, which hereafter 
will be known as the Materials and 
Maintenance Fee. The increase is 
due to the cost of instructional sup
plies and upkeep of equipment, which 
has risen greatly since the fees were 
first established in 1905.
The cost of instruction at the Car
negie Institute of Technology is 
borne by the income from endow
ment, and not by student fees. The' 
nominal charges which the students 
pay is applied to such incidental ex
penses as registration, maintenance 
of equipment, and supplies which are 
furnished the students and teachers.
Registration and other fees for 
1916-1917. Applicable only to the
day courses in the four schools.
NonResident.Resident.

Materials and
Maintenance .......... 20.00 20.00
Breakage Deposited .. 3.00 3.00
Total ........................$43.00 $53.00
A fee of $1.00 a day, up to a maxium payment of $5.00 is charged stu
dents who register after the regular 
registration dates as stated in the 
catalog.
In certain courses the nature of 
the work done requires more than 
the usual amount of supplies, and to 
facilitate these purchases, which must 
be paid for as used, a coupon book 
can be secured at the Cashiers office 
for $5.00 the unused portion being 
redeemable for cash.
DAHL GETS GRAPHICA 
SCHOLARSHIP.
Commendable Action of Undergrad
uate Organization.
To Clarence J. Dahl, plebe printer, 
of Meyersdale, Pa., has fallen the dis
tinction of being the first recipient 
of the Graphica Scholarship. This 
was announced at the Graphica ban
quet at the Kleman Inn last Tues
day evening. The award carries with 
it a payment of $50 to cover next 
years tuition fee. It was based on 
development of character and scholar
ship during the present year, with 
proper reference* to fellowship and 
need. According to Dean Connelley 
of Industries School, this is a pioneer 
action, as he knows of no other case 
in which an open undergraduate or
ganization of any American school 
has financed the career of one of its 
own members. The money for the 
scholarship was raised by the sale of 
the Graphica Christmas and Easter 
cards.

a vote of 244 to 30, cast by the mem

MECHANICAL ENGINEERING 
SOCIETY BANQUET.
Unique Annual Social Event To Be 
Held At German Club.
The stage is all set and every little 
detail has been arranged for the big 
annual Dutch Lunch and Social of 
the Carnegie Mechanical Engineering 
Society to be held Saturday evening, 
June 3rd, at the German Club, 222 
Craft avenue.
Special features have been arrang
ed for by the committee, in addition 
to the eats. These include a talk by 
Mr. Fred D. Winter, who gave such 
a brilliant talk before the Engineers 
Society of Western Pennsylvania at 
their last meeting, music by Messrs. 
Sweeney and Cost, of Glee Club 
fame, and Harold S. Bowen who 
though a plebe, has shown his good 
judgment in choosing the mechanical 
engineering course. Bowen, it will be 
recalled, played at the Science Stag 
and many other Tech affairs.
A pleasing feature will be the 
sleight-of-hand act by Morris D. 
Gladstein. This stunt was seen at 
the Pitt-Tech smoker and aroused so 
much wonder, that Mr. Gladstein is 
going to show some more of these 
tricks.
Among the souvenirs that will be 
distributed as favors of the meeting, 
are Jones & Laughlins Hand Books, 
circular celluloid slide-rules from 
the Wagner Electric Company, steel

TECH BAND HAS BANQUET.
Musicians Hold Forth at the Fort 
Pitt.
The members of the Tech Band 
held their annual banquet last Sat
urday evening at the Fort Pitt Hotel. 
The chief speaker of the evening was 
F. H. Sullivan, director of the band, 
who commended the men for their 
excellent work and for having been 
so faithful and for showing so much 
spirit during the year, a recent illus
tration of this being the fact that, in 
spite of the rain, 21 men turned out 
to play at the Interscholastic Track 
Meet, held on Schenley Oval in the 
afternoon. Short talks were made 
by other members of the organiza
tion, Manager Alfred J. Hanks, act
ing as toastmaster.
C. C. Britsch and H. E. Loeifler 
are the only members of the band 
who will graduate this year, this leav
ing an excellent nucleus on which to 
build next years band.

AIR INFECTION
Continued from Page 2 
colonies which developed from the 
test organism (Bacillus prodigiosus) 
would form the characteristic red pig
ment of that organism. In addition 
to these plates being exposed to innoculation from the droplets which 
fell upon them, they were by the 
method of the experiment exposed to 
air contamination during the period 
that they remain uncovered. It was 
necessary to rule out the presence of 
any red pigment producers in the air 
of the laboratory so that it would be 
certain that all the colonies which 
developed in the dishes and which 
showed a red pigment really were 
ejected from the mouth of the ex
perimenter. In order to accomplish 
this, a control plate of the same di
mensions as those above described 
and containing the same nutrient ma
terial was exposed during the course 
of the experiment a few feet behind 
the back of the experimenter. The 
fact must be recognized that this con
trol, in addition to ruling out the pres
ence of any red pigment producers 
in the laboratory air, would give an 
index of the number of organisms 
which would fall upon such a surface 
in the given time. This number sub
tracted from the total number appear
ing on the dishes would give an idea 
of the number which would be direct
ly charged to droplet infection. The 
Petrie dishes used in the experiment 
together with the control were incu
bated for four days at 20 degrees C., 
at which time the following results 
were obtained:
Plate Number 1, ft. from experi
menter; Plate Count, 180 white colo
nies, 160 red colonies. Total, 340.
Plate Number 2, ft. from experi
menter; Plate Count, 20 white colo
nies, 75 red colonies; Total 95.
Plate Number 3, ft. from experi
menter; Plate Count, 11 white colo
nies, 15 red colonies, 5 yellow colo
nies; Total, 31.
Plate Number 4, ft. from experi
menter; Plate Count, 3 yellow colo
nies, 2 orange colonies, 2 red colonies; 
Total, 7.
Plate Number 5, ft. from experi
menter; Plate Count, 16 white colo
nies, 4 yellow colonies, 2 orange colo
nies, 2 red colonies; Total, 24.
Plate Number 6, ft. from experi
menter; Plate Count, 18 hite colonies, 
no red colonies; Total, 18.
Plate Number 7, ft. from experi
menter; Plate Count, 12 white colo
nies, 1 orange colony, 3 red colonies; 
Total, 16.
Plate Number 8, Control; Plate 
Count, 5 white colonies; Total, 5.
An inspection of the above data 
gives some very interesting informa
tion. First of all, the control plate 
showed no red pigment producers and 
it may therefore be assumed that 
there were none such in the labora
tory air and that those which devel
oped on the other plates came from 
the mouth of the experimenter. It 
further shows that air conditions in 
the laboratory were such that during 
the course of the experiment, only 
five organisms alighted upon this area 
which were capable of development 
thereon. All others developing upon

an equal area exposed in front of the 
experimenter whether or not they 
were pigment producers may safely 
be assumed to have come from his 
mouth. Conclusive evidence though 
as to the distance to which organisms 
can be propelled from the mouth of 
an individual speaking under the con
ditions of the experiment is given by 
the presence of the red colonies in the 
plates. It will be noted that even at 
a distance of seven feet, the test or
ganism was recovered and it is quite 
possible that if other plates had been 
placed at a distance greater than sev
en feet from the experimenter, the or
ganism might have been found in 
these also. An inspection of tht total 
number of colonies developing in the 
exposed plates shows for the most 
part a gradual decrease in numbers 
the farther we go from the experi
menter. The conclusion drawn from 
the experiment is that droplet infection is possible within a radius of Program for Tuesday Evening, June
