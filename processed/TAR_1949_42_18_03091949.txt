Carnival Cost 
To Be Lower 
This Spring
Committee Plans 
To Unify Carnival 
With Circus Theme
Sympathetic to student budgets, 
this years Spring Carnival will 
not be as costly as it has been in 
recent years. General chairman J. 
K. OHare has announced that 
Carnival tickets will cost $4.75 as 
compared with last years price 
of $7.00.
Antics usually associated with 
the big top will move in on the 
Carnegie campus May 13 and 14 
with Spring 
Carnival taking 
on a C ire us 
theme. All or
ganizations are 
being urged to 
design their 
decora tions, 
floats, and mid
way booths in 
keeping with 
the Circus 
motif.
S u perstitions J. K. OHare 
will be challenged as the Carni
val program for Friday the thir
teenth gets under way on all parts 
of the campus. The first heats of 
the buggy races, the coronation of 
the carnival queen, who will be 
chosen this year by a popular 
vote, and the float parade will be 
followed by an informal street 
dance to which the entire college 
crowd of the city will be invited.
The formal dance will be held 
as usual on Saturday night. Soror
ity skits, an innovation at last 
years Carnival, the final heat of 
the buggy race and the presenta
tion of Carnival prizes and tro 
phies will fill out the program for 
the day.
Book Exchange
Alpha Phi Omegas book ex
change will end operations for 
this semester on Thursday, 
March 10. Books not sold will 
be returned to owners on that 
date.
Dont Let The 
Tartan Slip Up 
In Its Coverage
Does your club or organiza
tion want to see its activities re
ported in the Tartan? Is it do
ing anything that would be of 
interest to the rest of the cam
pus? Do you know of anything 
that is happening on the campus 
which is not being reported by 
the Tartan?
If the answer to any of the 
above questions is Yes, walk, 
dont run, to the nearest tele
phone and let us know about 
it Tartan reporters try to cover 
every possible source of news, 
but they may be slipping up. 
They want your help.
Should you have any sugges
tions call MU. 5365 or drop a 
note to the Tartan through in
ter-school mail at the CIT Post 
Office.
Were SorryThere appeared in last weeks 
Tartan a reference to a Tau Delta 
Phi loudspeaker which, the Tar
tan story suggested, was operat
ing in competition with the 
Dormicom rally on February 23. 
The Tartan did not mean to imply 
that Tau Delta Phis loudspeaker 
was operated during the Dormi
com rally or that its members 
were responsible for the removal 
of fuses from Dormicoms equip
ment. The Tartan had no reason 
to believe that such was the case, 
and did not intend to convey that 
impression.

Council Points and 
Keys Committee.
StudentCouncil 
Considers New 
Constitution
Committee Headed By 
Meyers Makes Report 
On Revised Document
Consideration of Student Coun
cils revised constitution will be 
the first order of business when 
Council convenes this afternoon.
Subsequent to Council approval, 
the document, which has been 
prepared by a Council committee 
headed by Gerry Meyers, must be 
presented at a general all-school 
assembly for ratification by a ma
jority of the full-time day stu
dents present at the assembly.
For Clarification 
Meyers, Councilmen Sapper, 
Rowles, Engle, and Miss Rae, 
have revised the constitution for 
purposes of clarification. Some 
of the major revisions include a 
re-definition of eligibility for 
Council membership, as well as 
clarification of the tenure and 
voting status of members.
A tentative proposal which will 
be considered during the meeting 
concerns a revision of member
ship eligibility to permit fifth 
year students who are registered 
as full-time undergraduates to 
hold positions on Council.
Roberts Rules 
Adoption  of Roberts Rules of 
Order will become mandatory 
under a completely new article 
which has been added to the con
stitution by the committee. An
other revision demands the ap
proval of two-thirds rather than 
three-fourths of Council members 
for the adoption of by-laws.
Under the revised constitution, 
the position of assistant secretary 
is included among Council of
ficers and carries with it auto
matic succession during the sec
ond semester to the voting posi
tion of secretary.
Pat Ryan
Council 
Margin
Banquet Plans Set 
Off Fireworks In 
His First Meeting
Pat Ryan squeaked through 
a close election, as expected, last 
Wednesday to become Council 
president. Dormicoms chief con
tender, Gerry Meyers, became 
vice-president by polling 19 votes 
to Ryans 22.
Confusion and bickering, which 
made last semesters sessions ap
pear harmonious by comparison, 
lowlighted the remainder of 
the meeting. The fireworks arose 
over Councils plan for its ban
quet.
Nip and Tuck
Upon accepting the gavel from 
retiring President Prus, Ryan 
stated, I will do everything in 
my power to 
make Council 
an e f f i c ient 
body on the 
campus and an 
organ ization 
which will be 
looked up to by 
students and 
faculty.
E x pecting a 
close election, 
Council mem
bers were 
warmly welcomed by their par
ties as they entered the council 
room. Just as the balloting was 
beginning, Wes Kenny, the last 
Dormicom councilman to appear, 
was met with loud cheers. The 
momentary Dormicom advantage 
was nullified as Lee Wiley traips
ed in right at his heels.
Dormicoms plan for a nomin
ating speech by Councilman Fockler was upset when Councilman 
Engle forgetting himself, beat 
Fockler to the pun eft.
Down It Came 
An air of unusual formality 
prevailed over the new Council as 
it moved into its agenda. Marie 
DelliGatti reported on proposed 
plans for the annual Council ban
quet for which money had been 
budgeted. Then it was as if 
Clancy lowered the boom. 
Councilman Henry Clay stated 
that the old Council didnt deserve 
a banquet and that he represented 
the students that held that opin
ion. His views were ecnoed by^ 
other Dormicom members. Older* 
members of Council felt the new 
members were not in a position 
to criticize since very few were 
familiar with the Council pro
ceedings of the past semester.
Ridiculous 
Commenting on the bickering, 
Councilman OHare said, This 
whole affair is ridiculous. It is 
typical of the trumped up issues 
so prevalent around election 
time.
Actually the banquet had been 
approved previously and any dis
cussion as to whether or not it was 
to be held was declared out of 
order by President Ryan.
Confusion Reigns 
Councilman Sapper moved that 
the banquet be a non-date affair. 
The roll call vote showed virtually 
all Dormicom members were 
against the motion.
This vote, since the holding of a 
Council banquet was an accepted 
fact and the bringing of dates 
had been discussed, was pointed 
out by many as showing that the 
Dormicom members were voting in 
favor of bringing dates to the

Editorials
Speak Softly, Gentlemen
A shudder went up and down our spine as 
we surveyed the approach used by so many of 
the new Dormicom members of Council last 
week.
Casting aside what we might have looked on 
as well-considered discretion in their first con
tact with Council, they busily charged onto ob
viously unfamiliar ground and proceeded to get 
lost in the trees while looking for the forest.
They seemed to be imbued with a spirit re
mindful of fanatic zealots whose bloodshot eyes 
will not be taken from the Holy Grail hanging 
before them.
Council is a group that by nature must func
tion in an aura of understanding and cooperation. 
The belligerent attitude shown by a few of the 
Dormicom members last week will serve only to 
break down the understanding and unity of pur
pose which have been developing this year much 
more than now is generally realized.
Certainly, Dormicom, stand up for what you 
believe are your rights, but what are you really 
trying to accomplish?
Too Much To Ask?
The king is dead, long live the king.
Inter-fraternity council has a new president. 
As in the past this event has been greeted with 
appropriate fanfare. And, as in the past, we won
der again if the IF council is going to remain the 
nonentity it has been and now is.
Whether the responsibility can be laid at the 
feet of IF officers, or at the feet of fraternity men 
in general, the conclusion is inescapable that the 
attitude of Carnegies fraternities has not been 
that of, What more can we do to make a more 
solid contribution to the education of our mem
bers and to the welfare of the school? but 
rather, What will we have to do to stay just 
one jump ahead of the wolves?
Perhaps it is expecting too much to ask for a 
constant self-evaluation and dedication to higher 
goals, but the axiom If you are not going for
ward you are going backward, appears to us to 
deserve a great deal more consideration here. 
And this need is not restricted to fraternities.
Uninformed Demagogy
The case of the Student Council banquet 
presents a curious dilemma. We are just as firmly 
convinced that some Council members have not 
earned a banquet, their efforts not even approach
ing mild exertion, as we are that others would 
find a banquet little enough reward for the time 
and effort they have devoted to Council activi
ties.
The Dormicom campaign issue, that last semes
ters was a do-nothing Council, is ridiculous on 
the face of it. The NSA and key questions were 
handled as forthrightly as any Council could 
handle them. The Council realized its own organ
izational shortcomings and took definite steps to 
remedy them. All these were in addition to its 
regular, specified duties.
Certainly we feel that there exists much room 
for improvement, and there are many jobs that 
yet need to be done, but the claim and the atti
tude that last semesters Council was a donothing Council have no basis.
Target For When?Band Members 
Attend Festival
Morton Gould To Lead 
Kiltie Representatives
Morton Gould will act as guest 
conductor when musicians from 
twenty-two colleges meet for the 
Intercollegiate State band festival 
at Indiana State-Teachers college 
on March 24, 25, and 26.
Twelve members from the Kiltie 
band have been selected by the 
festival committee to represent 
Carnegie Tech. The largest part 
of the program consists of music 
composed especially for the event 
by Mr. Gould.
Color will be added to the con
cert by each man wearing the uni
form of his respective school. The 
Kilties should be outstanding in 
this event as a result of the rela
tively large number selected, as 
well as for their' colorful uniforms.
Kilties who will participate 
are: Paul Graham, Sherman Tepper, Joe Krysic, Charles Koester, 
Henry Levine, A1 Krasic, Ben 
Benack, A1 Orbell, Jim James, Bill 
Waller, Larry Slaugh, and Dean 
Streator. Altogether one hundred 
and twenty-five pieces will play 
in the festival concert.
Voice Of THe People
Editor, THE TARTAN:
Upon reading the March 2 issue of The Car
negie Tartan, I was somewhat startled and sub
sequently astounded when I noted your editorial 
entitled No More Reviews.
Like an Ostrich 
Unfortunately, I am not fully acquainted with 
all the particulars concerning this action by the 
drama department. There may be factors in
fluencing their decision that outweigh the ob
vious demerits involved in silencing, by ap
parently arbitrary methods, a criticism of stu
dent performances.
I, personally, am reminded of an ostrich bury
ing its head in the sand upon the approach of 
the enemy. The ostrich is not noted for its in
telligence. There is also the possibility that our 
ostrich, in burying its head, is overlooking con
siderable opportunity.
Expect Criticism 
It is perfectly apparent to me that everyone 
is constantly subjected to reviewing and criti
cism, regardless of whether openly and in print 
or behind the back yard fence. Fortunately, we 
able to do our criticizing in print; and let no 
one underestimate the importance of this asset. 
Any infringement of this asset should be im
mediately challenged.
Dramatists, if they expect to perform, will 
be criticized. They might as well get used to it 
here, and I am sure that students in the drama 
department will agree with this rather funda
mental statement.
Not a True Voice 
You are the student newspaper. That means 
that you are the student voice. It is your job to 
assimilate information and dispense it honestly. 
Productions by the drama department are stu
dent affairs. Any student is invited to attend, and 
these productions are student business just as a 
production on Broadway or at the Nixon is the 
business of the public.
If the students, through you, are not allowed 
an expression of their voi^e in matters of gen
eral importance, then you are not a true voice. 
Faith in you is undermined, and you are value
less. This is indeed a lamentable situation on any 
campus.
Very truly yours,

Tau Beta Pi Calls Early
New members for Tau Beta Pi will be called 
earlier in the spring semester than has been the 
custom in the past. This early calling will per
mit the election of second semester seniors who 
would otherwise not be eligible. Special permis
sion to hold this election was granted by the Na
tional Fraternity of Tau Beta Pi.
A new and fairer system of electing members 
has also been approved. This election will be 
based on a quality point system rather than on 
a yes or no vote by the present members.
In addition to second semester seniors, sec
ond semester juniors will also be eligible for 
spring calling.

Rush To Placement Bureau 
Indicates Job Competition
Indicating that the rush for post-graduation employment is on, 
senior engineers in a steady stream are daily crowding the office of 
the bureau of placements.
In the opinion of Charles E. Wangeman, head of the placement
office, competition for jobs this#___________________________________
year will be more keen than last
year, primarily as a result of the 
increased number of engineers 
graduating.
Schedule Full
Wangeman stressed the fact 
that fuD advantage of the place
ment offices facilities may be ob
tained only through complete co
operation with the office by the 
individual student.
The placement bureau brings 
to the students attention the 
various types of work available, 
he said, but with our facilities 
limiting us to interviews with 
representatives of approximately 
three companies each day, our

schedule of interviewing repre
sentatives is full until Easter.
Approximately 600 companies 
have been concase it is imWangeman possible for the 
interviewing representa t i v e to 
visit the Carnegie campus.
* Time Limited
Since companies are usually 
unable to spare many men to 
serve as interviewers, and since 
theee interviewers have a fixed 
schedule which limits the time 
they may spend at any one 
school, Wangeman stated, it is 
often impossible to schedule 
meetings between an interviewer 
and all the seniors who are in
terested in his particular com
pany.
As a result of a pre-interview 
process of elimination, however, 
applicants who are not suited for 
or interested in the positions 
offered by a particular company 
may be eliminated so that inter
views may be distributed more 
equitably among other seniors.
Noting that a student may re
turn for the rest of his life for 
guidance and help in obtaining 
employment, Wangeman pointed 
out that the placement office 
offers this service not only to the 
graduating senior, but to any 
student or former student, gradu
ate or non-graduate, in the day 
or evening school.
Women Nominees
All women nominess to of
fices in various organizations 
must file their names in the 
Dean of Womens office before 
their election.
This is necessary in order 
that the names may be check

Mens Dorm Council
Adopts New Look
Mens Dorm council has taken on a new look.
What may have been in former years a campus laughingstock 
because of its lack of organization has taken on an efficiency and 
sense of direction that have given its members a pride in contributing 
to its accomplishments through#----------------------------
working on its committees and for 
its interests.
New Regime
The new regime began in 
Dorm council when Gerry Mey
ers was elected last year to take
over this years ..... .......

Along with * V
him, Paul Hanna was elected
man, and CharW tJT m 
les Grimes was , , '.%
elected custodM
mer confusion ^
was unnecesGerry Meyers
sary, Meyers set up the meetings 
to follow strict parliamentary pro
cedure, which, he admits, was 
rough for the first few meetings. 
All For It
But alter the members saw 
that they were getting more work 
done in less time they were all in 
favor of it, he said. Were pret
ty happy about the way our meet
ings have worked out, Meyers 
went on, but we havent done 
anything that any other organiza
tion couldnt do just as we did. 
The cornerstone of the Dorm 
Council organization is in the ex
ecutive committee meeting, which 
is held an hour before the full 
council meeting. All items of bus
iness must be brought by coun
cil members to the six members 
of the committee before the ex
ecutive meeting in order to receive 
attention at the regular meeting.
Now Helps
This regulation instigated severe 
criticism, at first, but it now clear
ly serves to expedite the transac
tion of business.
A large-scale social program is
zation in addition to its function 
of governing the dormitories. For 
the spring semester one thousand 
dollars has been allocated for so
cial events, exclusive of , Spring 
Carnival.
The most recent of Dorm Coun
cil activities was an informal 
dance last Friday night at the 
University club.

After a prolonged period of darkness, the intramural board 
has finally come up with a rather impractical solution to the 
problem of regulating intramural competition between frater
nal organizations having a primarily social existence and those 
that are purely athletic clubs.
For the past two years it has become increasingly evident 
that a fraternity composed of approximately 60 members can
not be expected to compete with the athletic cream-of-thecrop from among the independents. This year the situation 
has come to a head as Emanon and TNT, two strictly athletic 
combines, have made a farce of the race for the All-Points 
trophy.
A proposed amendment to the constitution made last 
week by the Intramural board has as its initial article the 
clause that at the beginning of each year, an organization 
shall submit an eligibility list of not more than 60 or less, than 
12 men, from which list all of their intramural player rosters 
will be chosen for that year.
Fine! Its very gratifying to see that the intramural board 
has finally realized the existing conditions which have so en
dangered the fine quality of competition that has always marked 
the CIT campus.
There seems to be only one catch to such an amendment: 
it wont workat least not in accomplishing a more even brand 
of competition in all sports. If it does anything, it will en
courage the independents to organize more athletic units than 
before, and to intensify their search for prize athletes among 
the non-fraternity men.
While the average fraternity has approximately 50 or 
60 members from which to choose all their teams, each in
dependent outfit has the entire 1800 remaining independents 
from which to choose their list. The odds are 30 to 1 against 
the fraternities.
The only practical solution which we see can be applied 
successfully to the situation is to break up the leagues into an 
independent league or leagues, and a fraternity league. This 
has accomplished its purpose at most other colleges, where fra
ternities were in a similar minority position.
MEET THE NEW COACHESThis Friday evening at the 
Kappa Sig house stag smoker, Carnegies varsity football play
ers will meet Dr. Eddie Baker and Eddie Hirshberg, the new 
football coaches, 'for the first time.
The hostsbesides Kappa Sigs 12 varsity football players 
and managerswill be the Portage Hotel of Akron, Ohio. This 
is the place where the Tartans wrere stricken with food poison
ing on the eve of their game with Oberlin on November 6. To 
make up for their drastic error in food selection, the hostelry 
recently forwarded a check to Mr. Overend which is defraying 
the cost of the affair.

Because He Flanked The Finger-Nail Test
|P PIOPII are whiskering about you, better check up on your 
hair. Before J.P. witched to Wildroot Cream-Oil hair tonic, 
he was wide open for all kind of catty remark about his ratty 
appearance. Not to today! Now that he using Wildroot 
Cream-Oil regularly, annoying dryness and loose, ugly dan
druff are gone. His hair stays put all day. He can pass the 
Wildroot Finger-Nail Test without batting an eye,
J.P.s experience leads us to suggest that you try non-alcoholic 
Wildroot Cream-Oil containing Lanolin, too. Get yourself a

New Tartan Basketball Coach
Appointment of Frank (Mel) Cratsley as Carnegies new basket

Bill Donohoe resigned his dual position as football and basketball
coach last December. ?-----------------------------------------------------quesne, and West Virginia.
In the fall he turned to theThis appointment came exactly 
ten years to the 
very day that 
Cratsley con

career in foot

Star Forward 
For three 
years, in the 
late thirties, he 
was a star forward for Max Hajinums basketbatll teams. Twice he 
teamed with Bob Stark to bring 
home the eastern intercollegiate 
basketball title, defeating such 
formidable opposition as Temple, 
Penn State, Georgetown, Pitt, DuMel Cratsley

High Scorer
In a basketball game against 
West Virginia in 1938, he poured 
i 36 points through the nets, an in| dividual scoring record that still 
stands.
After graduating from Carnegie

By Paul Offermann
NEW WILMINGTON, PA., 
March .Bill Donohoe was given 
about the best farewell present 
any coach ever received tonight, 
when his under-manned basket
ball squad out-fought and out
played Westminsters towering 
Titans for 58 minutes before los
ing a dual battle with the officials 
59-55.
Theodore Presents
After Mike Theodore had pre
sented him with an engraved wrist 
watch on behalf of the team and 
Walter Burns, Donohoe made one 
last request of his players, and 
<that was a victory over the Titans, 
on their band box home court 
in 58 contests.
Led by little Marty Chetlin 
playing his last game for Carnegie 
and captain Theodore, the Tar
tans proceeded to run circles 
around the home team, holding a 
7-point lead at orlb time in the 
second quarter. Chetlin set the 
pace in the opening minutes, 
throwing in three quick baskets.
Theodore Goes Out
Theodore scored on three long, 
one-handed push shots, to give 
the Plaid its seven point lead.
Officials Tut Melman and Dick 
Phillips, once again catered to the 
home crowd, handing the Titans 
30 free throws. Chetlin incurred 
four fouls in the first half, while 
Theodore left the game with five 
personnels in the middle of the 
fourth quarter.
More Fouls Called
This left the Skibos without 
their two highest scorers for the 
final two-minute drive to check 
the Titans victory bid, and Tom 
Beck was cut down when they 
each incurred their fourth per
sonnel in the fourth quarter.
This marked the third time that 
Melman and Phillips had teamed 
up to make victory certain for 
the home team. They did it at 
Bethany where the Bisons earned 
a five-point win from the free 
throw line, and then they obliged 
Carnegie customers by handing 
the Tartans a four-point win over 
Oberlin.
Despite Westminsters success 
in fouling Theodore out of the 
game, Bob McCullugh and Joe 
Matsey did some outstanding back 
board work against the Titans 
towering Chet Dembinski and Don 
McCullugh, to hold off defeat un
til the final minute when the 
home teams McCullugh sank a 
layup to ice the game.

Carnegie Techs rifle team de
feated Duquesne 1354 to 1247 in 
an intercollegiate match on March
3. High man for CIT was Duke 
Smith with an aggregate score of 
282.
This match was the second in a 
series of four intercollegiate 
matches. The win was more im
pressive because of the Dukes 
first-place rating in the Second 
Army Area.

team will participate in a precollegiate national championship 
match in New York. They will 
meet teams from West Point, An

6THE CARNEGIE TARTANWEDNESDAY, MARCH 9, 1949
Plaid Swimmers Place Third In 
Penn-Ohio Championship Meet
Demas, Luckey Victors, Set New Records:
Slippery Rock, Allegheny Place First, Second
Although Dave Luckey and Nick Demas contributed recordbreaking performances in the Penn-Ohio championships held last 
Saturday in the Carnegie pool, the Plaid mertnen were able to 
place only third, trailing, with 33 points, behind Slippery Rock with 
45 and Allegheny with 40. ?-------------------------------------------------------
Behind Carnegie Edinboro, Case, 
Westminster, W & J, and Lock 
Haven finished in that order.
Drop Relay Again
After six events had been com
pleted, with only the 440 yard 
freestyle and the 400 yard relay 
remaining, Carnegie was in first 
place by one point. In those two 
events Slippery Rock collected 15
points and Allegheny 12, while 
the Tartans got only two.
The relay is the event which has 
been the bugaboo for the Tartans 
all season, being the event in 
which all five losses in dual com
petition were administered.
Among the other Plaid compe
titors, freshman Gray Duncan 
scored a surprising first in the lowboard diving competition.
Luckey Wins Again
Unbeatable Dave Luckey closed 
out his intercollegiate swimming 
competition with another victory 
in his favorite, the 200 yard breast 
stroke. However, he was pushed 
by Toth of Slippery Rock to a 
new meet record of 2:36.1 for the 
event, breaking his own record of 
2:39, set in 1947.
Nick Demas, Carnegie freestyle 
ace, was the hard luck boy of the 
meet. After setting a new meet 
record in the 100 yard freestyle 
event in the preliminaries he was 
able to take only a third in the 
final competition. However he did 
score a first in the 50 yard free
style.
Other Winners
Other Carnegie Point winners 
were Bob Eicholtz who took a 
close second behind Demas in the 
50 yard event, and Tony Zukasky 
who placed fourth in the diving.
The most exciting event of the 
afternoon came in the 220 yard 
freestyle event when Budny ol 
Slippery Rock and Dayse of Al
legheny finished in a dead heat.
Although Slippery Rock man
aged to gather the highest point 
total they scored only one undis
puted victory, in the 400 yard re
lay. Their victory was made pos
sible by scoring heavily in sec
onds and thirds.

Marketing Class 
To Poll Students 
About Bookstore
When 200 Carnegie students 
are polled, starting tomorrow, on 
whether they desire an expanded 
bookstore, the marketing class 
conducting the survey will be out 
to do a more accurate job than 
Gallup and Roper did several 
months ago. *
The students will be contacted 
today for interviews with the 
market researchers, who will try 
to determine what sort of book
store is desired in the future.
The 200 students to be inter
viewed were drawn in a random 
sampling of the entire student 
population which was divided in
to groups on the basis of sex, vet
erans, status, and residence. Files 
in the Deans office were kept in 
use early this week as the students 
running the poll carefully went 
through them scientifically select
ing the students to be interviewed.
Since the poll is only a class 
exercise, the school will not put 
its results to any use.
Payne To Direct Production 
Of She Stoops To Conquer
Noted director B. Iden Payne will depart from long tradition in 
presenting Oliver Goldsmiths She Stoops To Conquer this month 
in the Carnegie theater.
In announcing his annual production, which has been a 
Shakespearian play in recent#------------------------------------------------------
years, Payne explained that the 
drama departments previous pro
duction of one play of this type 
this year had prompted his deci
sion.
Directed It Before
A man of vast and respected 
knowle d g e of
the theatre, Mr.
Payne spoke of 
lis previous ex
periences with 
:he p 1 a y.^ I 
tiave done the 
play twice be
fore on the pro
fessional stage 
and once in a 
college theatre.
In my earlier
days I played B. Iden Payne
many parts in She Stoops To Con
quer myself.
Mr. Payne stated that he will 
do the play not as an exact repro
duction of the eighteenth century 
style of presentation, although 
many features of that style will 
be present. For example, the stage 
hands will actually be seen by the 
audiences as they perform the 
scene changes.
Lovable Characters
Concerning himself with the di
rection of the play, he noted that 
it is full of lovable characters, and 
that a mistake is often made in 
treating She Stoops To Conquer 
too much as an offshoot of the res
toration dramawhich is brittle 
and wittywhereas Goldsmiths 
play is warm-hearted humor.
Payne has built up a strong 
following at Carnegie and the 
feeling must be reciprocated, for 
Mr. Payne says of the CIT drama 
department, As to my knowledge, 
it is one of the most practical and 
best organized theaters in the 
country.

Canterbury House Open 
To Evening Students
Engineers Banquet Discussed; Easter Assembly
Cancelled By Evening School Council
The highlights of the Evening Student Council meeting last 
Sunday was a discussion by the Reverend Hugh Clark of the facili
ties of the Canterbury House which are available to the evening 
students. Rev. Clark said that the house is open almost all the time 
------------------------------------------------------?and that students are always welOrchids to Mr. Lloyd Weninger 
of the Drama faculty for his fine 
portrayal of the daily life of a 
Polish-American family. He has 
succeeded in capturing the spirit 
of the family in heart-warming 
fashion. Mr. Weninger got the 
background for his play during 
the several years that he spent as 
a roomer at the home of Mr. 
Stanley Zabaglo, who is a tin
smith on the Carnegie campus. 
Aided by the Zabaglo family all 
through the production, the 
drama students have presented 
one of the finest offerings that we 
have seen in years.
The current production at the 
Playhouse, Command Decision, 
marks the fifth time this season 
that Carnegie drama students 
have carried major parts. Of the 
eighteen men who make up the
cast, three are currently enrolled 
here and one is a graduate. They 
are Clinton Roberts, William 
Ross, William Putch, and the 
graduate is Wally Parks.
The January 30 edition of the 
New York Herald Tribune car
ried an article by Gordon Allison 
about a distinguished Carnegie 
alumnus, William Eythe. In the 
interview Mr. Eythe, who is cur
rently starring in the Broadway 
hit, Lend An Ear, stated that 
he has found Carnegie Tech 
graduates in theaters all over the 
world. Eythe will be remembered 
by many evening students for his 
work in The Beggars Opera in 
the Carnegie Theater and in sev
eral of the revues written by 
Charles Gaynor for the Play
house.

they have faithfully backed eve
ning school activities.
Our hurrahs this week are di
rected at a fellow who has re
ceived them before, but never
theless we must give credit where 
credit is due. This weeks re
cipient Will Schnarrenberger de
serves our hurrahs for his grand 
unselfish work in operating the 
Black Cat (soft drink concession) 
at all councils dances. This is a 
hard thankless * job and smiling 
Will never shirks the task.
According to Richard Van Hellenger, Engineers Banquet plans 
are progressing at a fine pace. He 
has already obtained his toast
master and speaker. We could 
mention the names but since the 
Plaid will feature an article on 
the banquet in its next issue we 
will just have to ask you to wait 
another week.
Some of the fellows were rem
iniscing around the Cracker 
Barrel the other evening, and 
one of the group remarked about 
the fine Open House evenings 
Carnegie Tech held for friends 
and families of the students. The 
group as a whole agreed that they 
were fine affairs and also won
dered if the custom would ever 
return to campus.

or informal meetings. There is no 
denominational restriction on the 
use of these facilities.
George Bogovich, president, in
formed the group that there was 
a question t as to the advisability 
of holding an Easter assembly, and 
in the ensuing discussion it was 
decided to cancel plans for this 
activity. Further research may 
make it possible to schedule this 
program next year.
Dick Van Hellemger and An
thony Barbarino, co-chairmen, re
ported that plans for the Engi
neers Banquet are almost com
pleted. Director Cleeton has been 
secured as toastmaster, the menu 
was chosen and several replies to 
the letters of solicitation have been 
received indicating a good supply 
of souvenirs and door prizes.
George Schussler was received 
as a member of council, and the 
appointment of Frank Mihelich 
and Bob Ellstrom as co-editors of 
the Plaid was approved.

Problem: To hold down costs, and speed the 
extension of telephone service.
Sol ution: High-strength wire whose use allows 
the span between poles to be in
creased from 150 feet to more than 
300. One pole now does the work 
of two.
The problem, of course, is a continuing one 
for telephone people. High-strength wire 
with required electrical qualities is only one 
of many things they have developed to help 
solve the problem in these days of high con
struction costs.
In total, their developments are the reason 
why telephone service here is the best in 
the worldthe reason why a telephone call 
costs only a few pennies.

Apparently the relatively strict 
application of parliamentary rules 
to the conduct of the meeting by 
Dormicoms Henry (Ive got the 
book right here) Clay was more
of L handicap to them than to 
anyone else. The motion lLT finally carried.
It was rumored among Donnicom members that before today's 
meeting a Clue Clay Clan 
would be formed to help check 
the rambunctious start which 
Dormicoms new Council member 
had made.
