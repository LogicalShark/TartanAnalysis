COURSES OF COMMERCIAL ENGINEERING.
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT.
VOL. Ill, No. 25Cartan
PITTSBURG, PA., WEDNESDAY, MARCH 24, 1909TEN CENTS
The Faculty of the School of Applied Science has 
been made to feel the demand in the community for 
a kind of training somewhat different from that af
forded by the strictly technical courses offered by 
the School, and accordingly presents this prelimi
nary statement concerning a Department of Com
mercial Engineering to be established next year.
The courses in this department are intended to 
prepare men for lines of industrial activity, for suc
cess in which there is need of both technical and 
commercial training. The growth in the size of in
dustrial organizations, enlarging the field of their ac
tivities, and increasing their internal differentiation, 
is continually opening new opportunities for men 
with such combined training. In the days of small 
establishments one man was often obliged to handle 
all questions relating , to the commercial side of his 
business and the internal organization of his plant, 
as well as strictly technical questions. To-day, need 
of the separation of the producing and the selling 
branches of business is universally recognized. 
What is not as yet so generally seen is that there is 
room for economics in the more efficient organiza
tion and direction of the sales department, similar 
to those already effected in the producing depart
ment. That the field for such economics is by no 
means small may be inferred from the fact that the 
cost of marketing a product often nearly or quite 
equals the cost of producing it. The value to an or
ganization of a man capable of substituting more 
for less economical commercial methods is obvious.
The field for the activities of the man with com
bined technical and commercial training is not con
fined to positions of as great responsibility as that 
referred to above. The salesman, if he is handling 
any kind of mechanical, electrical or chemical 
product, will find 'his efficiency increased by the 
possession of a sufficient amount of technical knowl
edge to enable him to discuss intelligently the mer
its and demerits of competing products and to assist 
prospective customers to select such mechanical or 
other devices as are best adapted to satisfy their 
individual requirements. The man who combines 
with such technical knowledge a sufficient acquaint
ance with business and commercial practices and 
conditions, may look forward to a reasonably rapid 
promotion to a position of responsibility in the sales 
department either at the home office, in branch 
offices in our own country or a^ foreign representa
tive.
As to the subjects to be included in the courses 
in Commercial Engineering only general statements 
can as yet be made. On the technical side the work, 
while not less thorough than that given to students 
expecting to devote themselves to the strictly technical phase of their profession, will be somewhat 
less extensive and detailed. Each student will ac
quire some knowledge of all the branches of engin
eering taught in the Schools, and will have addi
tional work in that department of engineering to 
which he expects his future work to be related. On 
the commercial side the work will include courses in 
business organization, business methods, both Amer
ican and foreign, including methods of advertising 
and selling, insurance, law, customs regulations of 
our own and foreign countries, commerce, and other 
similar subjects.

4THE TA RTAN
| APPLIED DESIGN 1
In spite of the snow-storm that raged last Tues
day evening, 66 members of the School of Applied 
Design held what was one of the best and most en
joyable of the smaller dinners and smokers they 
have had yetand when it comes to having things 
of this sort Applied Design has all of the other 
schools backed clear off the map. To begin with, 
it was strictly informal, and the bunch was a jolly 
good one. The feed was Dago, Italian to be more 
exact, spagetti and all the rest, and for the length of 
time in which to make arrangements, the affair was 
a wonder.
Bohemia is just beginning to rub its eyes at nine 
oclock in the evening, and the little cafes that dot 
those sections of almost any city may be said to be 
entirely devoid of their usual patrons, until a later 
hour sees the life of the unconventional commence. 
The hour announced for the beginning of the affair 
was nine-thirty. Nine-thirty came and went, while 
the gathering of the clan was going on, so that it 
was fully an hour later when the meal was served. 
Then came the guests of honor, the faculty.
The dining room of the Hotel Grand is arranged 
to make quite an ideal place for such a gathering. 
The tables were scattered about, making little 
groups, some seating more than others. The fac
ulty occupied one end of the room and devoted the 
earlier part of the evening to the judging of the 
drawings of the Thistle competition.
Prof. Hornbostle started the after-dinner speeches 
going with a most interesting and informal talk on 
the aims of the school and the danger of taking 
things too seriously. Nicols acted in the absence of 
a toastmaster, and handed out large-sized chunks of 
guff before calling on each of the following for 
speeches: Messrs. Sparks, Hewlett, Ferrand, Lee,
Campbell, and Weber. Bruton, the Art Editor of 
the Thistle, was called on and announced that 
Reeves and Seidner had won the competition. Both 
of these gentlemen were in the room and rose by 
general acclamation to make a few appropriate re
marks. Steen followed and then Gleckler was in
duced to relate some of his experiences while abroad 
last year. Songs and cheers made the program a 
varied one. The only regretable feature was * that 
Joey refused to perform his usual stunthe was 
busy with another.
Now work, ye terriers, work.
The curtain rose on the last act of Perspective 
at 2.30 Monday.

Problem IX. In the course in Interior Decoration 
was a design for a small chest or casket to contain 
valuable objects. The jury, consisting of Messrs.
Ferrand, Lee, Campbell, and Hewlett, awarded a 
first mention to W. Nies and Miss L. Miller.
Mentions were awarded to the following in the 
order of merit:
Moss,
Keally,
Mis$ Sterling,
Hodgdon,
Miss Watson,
Hoffman,
Mrs. Emmert,
Wilson, J.,
Miss Uhrbom,
Miss Evans,
Miss Thomson,
making thirteen mentions out of our fifteen designs 
submitted.
The March number of the Monthly Bulletin of the 
Carnegie Library of Pittsburg contains a list of ref
erences on Augustus Saint-Gaudens and his work. 
This list has been prepared by the reference depart
ment of the library for the use of those interested 
in the exhibition of the works of .iSaint-Gaudens, to 
be held in the hall of sculptre from April 29 to June 
30. All the references are to books and magazines 
in the central library at Schenley park, and may be 
had by calling at the reference room on the second 
floor. Copies of the bulletins will be found at the 
central library and the branches.
Word was received this week from F. M. Lippincott, 12, of the Decoration Class. He is now in 
Atlantic City, where he expects to remain for several 
weeks previous to his return to school. Lippincott 
had a siege of scarlet fever for several weeks in the 
city. He is now entirely well, and is at the sea
shore resting up.
THE BITTER END.
We thumb the pages thrice 
As we cram, cram, cram 
Our memories to renew 
For exam-yam-yam.
Our share of joy is none, 
For we sigh, sigh, sigh,
To think the term is done, 
And we must say good-bye.
Harvard May Give up Basketball.
On account of the poor showing of the Harvard 
basketball team during the past season and because 
of the general lack of student interest in the game, 
the Crimson in an editorial has seriously suggest
ed the abolition of intercollegiate basketball. Only 
interclass games would then be played.
A slight waning of interest in the game has also 
ben noticed at a few other Eastern colleges.

Only a few more days of school and then vacation. 
Only a few more exams, and thensuspense. Let 
us hope there will be no Ls or Fs.
Miss Alida Lattimore, Secretary of the Allegheny 
County Civic Club and of the Consumers League, 
addressed the students Tuesday afternoon. She 
spoke on Child Labor and the Child Labor Bills now 
in the Legislature. She spoke of the condition of 
children in Pittsburg industries, and told us about 
the work being done by the Consumers League and 
what we may do to help.
Pittsburg.
Pittsburg is a funny place
Were you ever in it?
Six times a day you wash your face, 
Your hands, most any minute!
The people, though, are not so bad
I really know no better
It is the weather makes me sad,
It never could be wetter.
Fannys Choker.
Fanny came down to breakfast later than usual 
wearing a high stiff collar,the kind her brother 
called chokers. She wore a cheerful smile, but a 
close observer would have seen at once that it was a 
little forced, and that she was not comfortable. She 
took her seat at the table with head held stiffly erect, 
and, in a strangely smothered voice, asked her 
mother for the cream and sugar.
Why did you get such a high collar, Fanny? I 
thought you hated that kind, said her mother.
Oh, Margaret wears this kind all the time, and 
lots of the other girls wear them, too. I think they 
look so nice and neat, replied Fanny, who was 
meanwhile enduring agonies in spite of her smiles.
She ate very little breakfast, and ignored her 
brothers broad grin and sly wink when he caught 
her fidgeting with the painful choker once or twice. 
Her neck felt as if it had a pasteboard box around 
it, she thought; but, nevertheless, she went bravely 
to school determined to look just as pretty and sty
lish as the popular Margaret. As Fanny was taking 
off her coat and hat in the cloak room, Margaret 
came in looking cool and comfortable in a Peter Pan 
collar.
Hello, Fan. Why, how funny you look! Why 
on earth do you wear such a high collar? It doesnt 
suit you a bit, and Margaret burst into a peal of 
laughter as she'looked at Fannys red face.
Just then Fanny suddenly realized that she did 
not look the least bit like Margaret, and that the
same things were not becoming to both. She had 
to admit that the collar did not look out of place on 
her plump neck, and she laughed with Margaret; 
but she felt foolish and awkward and a little angry 
at Margaret for going back on her. Fanny was 
obliged to keep her head facing the front of the 
room all day, as her collar* did not allow much 
turning of the head; but even though she apparently 
paid close attention all day, I doubt if she learned 
any thing. The minute she was inside of her own 
room, she pulled off the offending bit of linen and 
thrust it deep into a lower drawer, then contem
plated ruefully the red line around her neck.
She ate as much breakfast as usual the next 
morning, and when her mother asked, Where is 
your new collar, Fanny? she replied indifferently, 
Oh, they are going out of style. And brother 
chuckled audibly.

In Chemistry last week Miss Clark was asked to 
name the elements of which the human body is com
posed. Among others she named copper and plati
num. What an unusual body she must have!
Have you subscribed for the Thistle yet? Only 
two more days to get your order in!
Miss Gwynn, of the Senior Dressmaking Class, 
seems to have a great many pressing engagements.
Prof. EsquerreMiss Clark, why is the blood 
red?
Miss ClarkBecause of the oxygen in it.
Prof. EsquerreThen, why isnt the sky pink?
Candy Sale.
The Senior Household Arts Class will have a sale 
of home-made candies Friday afternoon at 3.30 in the 
Gym.
The other day one of the Plebes was puzzled to 
know what was left in a barometer tube when the 
mercury went out. Upon being told that it was a 
vacuum, she asked, What does a vacuum look like?
Hard to Explain.
Typewriter to the pencils said,
Now, will you tell me, please, 
Why, when I have no doors or locks
I have so many keys?
We do not know, the pencils said;
Its queer as quadrupeds!
But can you tell US why we wear 
Our rubbers on our heads?

---------------------------------------------------

THETA RT AN
On the 12th day of March, in the eventful year of 
1909, the iSenior Secretarial Class had an outing. No, 
we didnt visit the zoo. Neither did we have a pic
nic. You will think, then, naturally, that we must 
have visited the Block House. But you are wrong. 
The first place that was afflicted with fourteen pres
ences was the Union Savings Bank, in the Frick 
Building. The joint object of Miss Williams, Mr. 
Church, and Mr. Wood in taking us there first, was 
this: We had formed a conspiracy and each one was 
given a special part to play. While our worthy 
chaperons were engaging the attention of the men 
who were so kindly showing us around, we were to 
rob the bank. This vast amount of wealth was to 
form the capital with which the already mentioned 
conspirators were to establish a business so gigantic 
that at least fourteen private secretaries would be 
required. As a bribe, we were offered th coveted 
positions. Thus would our fondest dreams be re
alized. But, alas! Even for Margaret Morrison 
Carnegie students all does not run smoothly. It 
was discovered that the ring-leader of the whole 
deep-plot, Miss Powelcon, had escaped, whither we 
knew not. Thus did our dream become but a hid
eous nightmare! However, we soon becam^ so in
terested in what we were seeing, that our troubles 
were forgotten for the time being.
First, we were taken into the vault and were 
shown the safe deposit boxes; the wonderfuly huge 
vault doors, each weighing 17% tons; and the base
ment, where was the general machinery of the 
building. Our kind guardian then decided that it 
would be wise for us to rise to higher levels, so we
journeyed up to the top floor to view Mr. H. G.
Fricks office. It certainly is beautiful and brought 
to every one of the thirteen minds the sad thought 
that she would have been working in just such' an 
office had the fates been kind and helped along the 
contemplated robbery. We were shown the cash
books; the ledgers. But how different from our 
own! Where were all the familiar and friendly 
scratches, blots, and crosses, to which our experi
enced eyes have become accustomed? All, how
ever, were impressed with the perfectly quiet and 
restful air of the place, and felt that everything done 
was done correctly.
Last, but by no means least, came our visit to the 
offices of the Jones & Laughlin Steel Company. 
What a wonderful building it is! Wonderful, from 
the very selection of the paper on the walls, to its 
perfect filing systems. A place for everything and 
everything in its place, is a motto which will hold 
good in every square inch of the building. We were 
shown the methods of filing checks, documents, and 
blue-prints; the latest adding machines, which, for 
some unaccountable reason, were most popular, the 
loose-leaf ledgers; the fire-proof safes. In fact, one 
entire day would be none too much to spend in 
going through these ideal offices. Then we were 
taken into the luxuriantly furnished offices of the 
President and the Secretary. Oh, dear! We were 
once more forced to think of what might have been
6
had our schemes succeeded. But we cannot com
plain, for every one of these visits proved invaluable 
to us in our work. Just before our departure, the 
Secretary, who had been so kind in conducting us 
through the building, presented each with a pleasant 
surprise in the form of a nickel plated railroad spike 
paper weight, which shall ever be treasured as a 
memento of a most memorable day.
The Senior Household Arts Class gave a little sur
prise party to Prof. Esquerre, Friday evening. Miss 
Bradt and Miss Nickerson chaperoned the party. All 
had a jolly time and left wishing for many happy 
returns of the day.
THE PLAINT OF A PLEBE.
In Caesaris time, the seer said,
The Ides of March beware;
In the year of nineteen nine, I find 
That March Idees are rare.
Tho my gray matter dry I squeeze,
There are, alas, no March idees.
If Pbo times cos y
Gives twenty lines of force,
The local length of the convex lens,
Is fifty ohms, of course.
You see, they come in twos and threes,
They are so mixed, those March idees.
The Ides of March come once a year,
We all are glad, I ween,
For March idees, when quizzes came,
Are few and far between.
If you get one, youd better freeze,
Theyre very cozy, tho.se March idees.

of meeting is in the Orchestra Rehearsal Room of the 
Carnegie Institute. The cast are committing the 
first act, the men having been chosen so far include: 
James, Gibson, Borschneck, Keally, Horton, Silvernail, 
Tish, Bieler, Steen, Mitchell, and Nicols. That much 
interest is being taken in the production from the 
outside is assured from the number of letters that 
have been received from persons who saw last years 
show asking when the dates for its appearance will 
be announced.

As we are*led further into the depths of knowl
edge and our number is depleted by the inroads of 
business, social duties (?), etc., let us bear in mind 
the following inspiring verses:
The Discouraged.
If all the end of this continuous striving 
Were simply to attain,
How poor would seem the planning and contriving 
The endless urging and the hurried driving 
Of body, soul and brain.
But ever in the wake of true achieving 
There shines this glowing trail;
Some other soul will be spurred on, conceiving 
New strength and hope, in its own power believing 
Because thou didst not fail.
Not thine alone the glory or the sorrow 
To gain or win the goal,
Undreamed of lives in many a far to-morrow,
From thee their weakness or their force shall borrow, 
On! on! ambitious soul!
Ella Wheeler Wilcox.
SCIENCE OF SALESMANSHIP.
Your feet are small, the shoe clerk said, 
As he her instep pressed; |
The lady sighed and bowed her head,
And gladness filled her breast.
But little time with her he spent,
A busy clerk was he;
He sold her sixes ere she went
But they were numbered three.
Montreal Star.

We are sorry to learn that Mr. Hornbostel will not

Q'Callaghan was late on the morning of St. Pat

Prof. JamesTate, the next assistant who brings

SECOND YEAR INDUSTRIALS.
Monday afternoon was another fast day for we 
would-be-graduates. One that is not on the calendar. 
The reason for the break in our race along the home 
stretch are to me a total mystery. We are admitted 
to the Schools principally upon our honor, and as 
honorable wearers of the plaid which we love so 
dearly. Are we doing our duty? As for me, I was 
greatly disappointed in my class-mates and there are 
quite a number of the boys think the same. Now I 
believe it is up to us older members of the class to 
work together and to do something in the way of 
making good our losses in the past. The duty of a 
good soldier is to obey instruction, no matter what 
the disposition of the instructions or the instructor. 
When a fellow makes taffy he usually stirs it. Now 
if we want any taffy on the last day we shall have 
to make a devil of a stir.

On the first page we are printing the announce
ment of a new course that will be offered during the 
next school year. This will be considerable of a 
departure from any of the courses yet offered in the 
Schools and no doubt be more specifically applicable 
to Engineering salesmanship and business organiation than any of the courses in Commerce offered by 
the colleges.
When the drawings in the recent Thistle competi
tion were looked over a number of plagarism of well 
known drawings beside some very creditable origi
nals were  found. As there could have been no 
misunderstanding as to the terms of the offer in the 
competition, the guilty ones lay themselves open to 
the accusation of dishonesty.
Disregarding for a moment the ethics of the pony 
or the card indexed crib in examination time which 
seemed to be less in disfavor on account of super
vision in exams, it would seem to us that the few 
who have offended lack even elementary honesty. 
Because in their case there was a financial consid
eration. It may be a different case where money is 
diverted from a rightful recipient by underhanded 
means, from pocket picking, but we must confess 
that we can not distinguish any very considerable 
difference. As we said before, we do not undertake 
to settle the ethics of the school and we are content 
that the Faculty bear the entire burden of crib sup
pression, but we do think that a person who will 
deliberately steal ideas in order to win a paltry 
prize is no more entitled to consideration than those 
students who asked to leave last year on account of 
their petty thieving. *
Word was received on Monday of the death of Mrs. 
Ritchie Lawrie (Lida McDowell), mother of Ritchie 
Lawrie, Jr., Soph. Civil. She had been in ill health 
for some time, and died at the Columbia Hospital: 
The Tartan wishes to express the most profound 
and sincere sympathy for the one of the Schools 
who has suffered this irreparable lossthe greatest 
sorrow that can befall a man, the loss of his mother.
Perhaps if the bells in the buildings occupied by 
the Journeymen and Architects were connected with 
the clock in the Science Building there would be less 
complaint on the part of the Faculty about students 
being late at classes.

was abandoned some time ago owing to the impos

Dartmouth and Harvard Fail.
At Dartmouth the dining room was originally run 
by students. The experiment was a failure, and 
student management had to be given up. The 
present manager -says that he knows of no college 
dining room successfully run by students.
Within a few weeks the Harvard dining halls, be
cause of financial difficulties and general dissatis
faction, were withdrawn from the management of the 
undergraduates.
From Yale comes the report that the dining room 
there is run successfully by students, with a small 
profit. A professional manager is employed, but no 
information was received as to his powers and 
privileges.The Tech.
Much interest Is being manifested by Vanderbilt 
students in the movement on foot to erect a hand

GLEE AND MANDOLIN CLUBS.
With the catchy rythm of the Mulligan Musket
eers rousing the echoes from room 123 and the 
new Espanita number, Sonora, rising from the
Assembly Hall, the school buildings last Sunday af
ternoon were quite as attractive inside as out, in 
spite of the fine weather. Although several of the 
new numbers are still in a rather unformed state, 
the progress is rapid and the new program will 
surely be in fine shape for April 30th.
The committee, composed of Messrs. Summers, 
Sprague, Finkel and Jamieson, 'appointed to arrange 
the dance program, is already at work and this dance 
will without doubt be in this, as it must be in future 
years, one of the big social events not confined to 
any one section or class.
As already explained, the plan is to give a special 
concert by the Glee and Mandolin Clubs at Conserva
tory of Music, April 30th, and to have a reception 
and dancing immediately after. The musical pro
gram will be another success like Feb. 19th, while 
the price, fifty cents, is within reach of all.
On April lGth, the Glee and Mandolin Clubs give 
a concert in Dilworth Hall, under the auspices of 
the Pennsylvania College for Women. An im
promptu dance is on the program after the concert 
and will undoubtedly be enjoyed by the fellows. At 
the Bazaar to be given by the Hiland Presbyterian 
Church on April 22, our clubs will give a few num
bers. It looks like a big night in the matter of 
refreshments and fussing.

CIVIL SOCIETY.
The C. E. Society, at a special meeting held Tues
day, March 16, elected the following officers to serve 
for the balance of the school year:
PresidentG. W. Ketter.
Vice PresidentW. F. Glasser.
SecretaryA. G. Loyd.
TreasurerJ. L. Latham.
The regular meeting of the society was held last 
Saturday evening in the Science buildings. Mr. 
Ketter, the president, presided over the meeting, a 
large number of members being present, together 
with Mr. A. C. Whitehead, City Engineer, and a 
number of Night students of the Civil Department, 
who accepted the invitation to be present.
Prof. Thayer gave a very instructive talk, explain
ing the causes of numerous accidents in bridge 
construction. He pointed out that the factor of 
safety of the material was usually figured too small, 
as the age of the material, tension, overstraining, 
and uneven distribution of stresses, effect the factor 
of safety, and these are neglected by many engineers. 
Mr. Thayer described a number of bridge accidents, 
some of which were caused by the deficiency of the 
bridge construction and others by faults in tracks, 
etc., connected with the bridge.
Following Mr. Thayer, Mr. Latham, senior "civil, 
gave an interesting history of the modern sky 
scraper, following the construction of buildings 
from the broad low buildings of former times to the 
high narrow buildings of the present. He also de
scribed the difficulties of building foundations, the 
handling of materials, and process of construction of 
high buildings.
The principal talk of the evening was given by 
Mr. Whitehead, who laid particular stress on the 
aesthetics of bridge construction. He said that the 
bridges, buildings, etc., of former years were decor
ated to extreme, while now the ornaments were 
beautiful, and that the public demand beautiful 
bridges which they control and in a short time will 
insist on railroads, etc., beautifying their bridges 
and buildings. He regretted that the engineers and

architects of to-day copied the ancient styles instead 
of being original, although there are many new mate
rials available now. Mr. Whitehead said that a 
structure should express what it is intended for, that 
just as a church should look inspiring, so should a 
bridge look strong, a railway substantial, and a road
way commodious. He then described many of the 
city bridges, detailing the principal points of each 
and explaining the different forms used for different 
purposes. Of interest to the students is the fact 
that the Bellefield bridge, at the time it was built, 
was one of the largest stone arches in the country.
The fellows then gave a cheer for Mr. Whitehead, 
and aftei those piesent had served the inner man 
with a bountiful lunch served by the entertainment 
committee, the society adjourned.
DONT LET THE DIMPLE PEEP.
Now, do not blame me, Dolly,
I will not hear one word;
And if theres any scolding,
Tis I who must be heard.
What did you think me made of?
Am I dolt, a sheep? ,
Ah, Dolly, if youd not be kissed 
Dont let that dimple peep.
Sport frocks of every color,
For you are always fair;
Don hats that waken wonder 
And set the world a-stare;
Break every wise convention;
Make Mrs. Grundy weep;
But if you wish me to behave
Dont let that dimple peep.
Youve license to be cruel,
Although it is a shame;
And you may term me stupid 
At every sort of game;
And doubt me, Dolly; flout me,
And all contumely heap;
But if youd have a humble slave 
Dont let that dimple peep.
The things you like, Ill do them,
Obey your slightest wish;
Ill sacrifice digestion
Before your chafing dish,
Ill follow all caprices 
With desperation deep;
But, fascinating maid, beware
Dont let that dimple peep.
'Tis idle to be angry;
Nay, worsetis sinful, too.
About an act so harmless 
Why make so much ado?
One ways the only safe way
Tis very hard to keep.
Yes, Dolly, if youd not be kissed,
Dont let that dimple peep.

12THE TARTAN
| NINETEEN-TWELVE |
The fine weather last Sunday was no doubt re
sponsible for the large and representative turnout 
of 1912 men. If you want to know who they were, 
give Fleck a half-dollar.
Karl Heinrich Helm is one of our contingent of 
Holy City men, and sad to relate, he fully lives up 
to the reputation of this parched little burg. When
ever he feels tuned up for a spree, he hies himself 
to a pie factory and indulges freely in the unfor
bidden delights of Litzs old raspberry. He is an 
unusually social chap. His cheerful Hello there, 
is often heard to resound through the halls of wis
dom. He is a member of the social committee for 
the reason that he has three brothers-in-law, one 
actual and two prospective, to help him sell tickets.
The following incident, if it proves anything, will 
prove that he is very choice in the company he 
keeps. He was present at the recent hop given by 
the maidens of the Margaret Morrison School. He 
obtained permission from one of the fair damsels to 
lead her through the mazes of the Home Waltz. 
Then, when the hats were passed around, this same 
fair damsel was horrified to see her intended escort 
depart with another.
But, mit all der drawbacks, anyhow, he is a 
firstrate fellow, an able occupant of the chair, 
and a great beau among the ladies.
P. S.Have you ever noticed him saw wood in 
Room 216?
Why did McCowen give up his trip Sunday after
noon?
A special meeting is to be called in the near fu
ture to hear the final report of the Social Committee 
and to decide on various matters pertaining to the 
annual class banquet. It is desired that the men 
who expect to attend the banquet, put in their ap
pearance and help decide these matters to their own 
satisfaction.
Another deity has been added to our class. Have 
you met Billikens Cole?
THE CONTENTMENT OF THE EAST.
The sehikhs young son came in, curiousity having 
got the better of his shyness at last; he sidled con
fidently to his father, and was there embraced (in 
the way of these Arab fathers); presently he had 
snuggled close to his fathers feet and was become 
one of our company. I inquired then, in a blundering 
way, concerning the boys education; would he be 
sent to the schools in Cario?
He was born here, was the answer.
What matter?
He will then truly live here.
It is the custom of the Western fathers, 1 ventur
ed, to advance their sons above themselves.
How may this be done? he asked.
It is said, I replied, that the education of the 
schools promotes it.
If I send my son away to the schools, he answer
ed, like a man who had pondered much upon the prob
lem and become resolved, I shall accomplish his ruin. 
If I send him away, he will either remain away or 
return; if he remain, he will be forever unhappy, hav
ing been born to the freedom of this airy desert; if he 
return, he will be forever unhappy also, having tasted 
indulgence, having been corrupted by the luxury of 
the city. Now, if I send my son away to the schools, 
and if he remain away, he will either succeed or fail 
in life. But how, born in this desert, shall he suc
ceed, being forever at a disadvantage in an alien 
place? If he succeed, what shall compensate him 
for the stress and confinement he must suffer? He 
must live in a room; but how shall he endure to live 
in a room? And if he fail, what then shall become of 
him? I will keep my son with his tribesmen in the 
sand, that he may be strong and courageous and free: 
Here we dwell content, cultivating our few dates, 
raising our flocks in peace, exchanging our poor 
wealth for the corn of other places, so satisfying all 
our simple needs. What shall a man want more than 
his freedom? We are oppressed neither by labor 
nor wicked men; and we live in our own place, ac
cording to the will of God.
You are, then, content with the life you are lived? 
It is so.
And would live it over again, deed for deed, day by 
day, as you have lived it, since the beginning? 
Truly, khawaja!
My question had never before been answered in 
this way. I was amazed.
What is the explanation of your contentment?
I demanded.
If you wish a subscription to any engineering pub= 
lication it can be gotten through  The 
Tartan at student rates.

He looked up bewildered.
Why, I repeated,  are you content?
God willing, he replied, enlightened, I will ans
wer your question; I live where I was born.Nor

EXPERIMENTS WITH ROPE AND BELT DRIVES.
Some experiments have been undertaken by the 
Technical Institute at Charlottenburg, Germany, in 
order to establish definitely the loss of energy in 
transmitting power by means of belts and ropes. 
These experiments indicate that the capacity of belts 
for transmitting power at high velocity is consider
ably higher than given by ordinary formulas and 
calculating methods. It appears from the experi
ments that it is an advantage in belt drives to use 
large pulley diameters, and consequently high peri
pheral velocity. Considerably better results are ob
tained if the pulleys are made from wood for diam
eters less than 24 inches. An idler for obtaining the 
required tension, placed close to the small pulley 
and having a diameter at least 50 per cent greater 
than this pulley, does not reduce the efficiency of 
the drive in any appreciable degree when the belt 
speed is not greater than 100 feet per second. An 
idler for producing proper tension and for providing 
larger angle of contact on the smaller pulley is there
fore to be recommended in belt drives of high ratio 
betwen the sizes of the pulleys.
The friction in the bearings is considerably greater 
for rope drives than for belt drives, because ropes 
must be under higher tension than belts, all other 
conditions being equal. The efficiency of rope drives 
decreases considerably for high speeds, while it in
creases for belt drives. When high perpheral 
velocity is required it is therefore advisable to use 
belts rather than ropes. In the case of rope drives 
the efficiency is also reduced when the diameter of 
the pulley or sheave is reduced, due to the power re
quired for bending the rope, whereas the diameter of 
pulley in belt drives is of very little consequence, 
within rather large limits. The highest efficiency 
obtained during the test referred to was 98 per 
cent with the belt drive, all conditions being ideal. 
Power transmission by means of a single rope, gave 
97 per cent as the highest efficiency; using two 
ropes side by side, made the highest efficiency 95 
per cent; and only 90 per cent efficiency was ob
tained with four ropes side by side. The efficiency 
in the case of rope drives thus decrease about in 
proportion to the number of ropes employed. The 
figures quoted give the actual efficiency of the drive, 
the friction losses in the bearings being subtracted. 
The latter are also greater in the case of ropes than 
in the case of belts, due to the higher tension re
quired in rope drives. While idlers in the case of 
belt drives did not appreciably decrease the effi
ciency, in the case of rope drives it was found that 
idler sheaves decreased the efficiency considerably.

The department of chemical engineering at the 
University of Wisconsin, in charge of Professor 
Charles F. Burgess, has been carrying on an exten
sive series of tests of the various methods for meas
uring the heating values of gas, in order to enable 
the State Railroad Commission to determine a 
standard gas for fuel and illuminating purposes. The 
calorimeter of various types made both in this coun
try and abroad and used to test the heating values 
of gas have been thoroughly tested. It was discover
ed that one type of instrument extensively used and 
sold gave heating values from 10 to 20 per cent 
higher than the gases measured actually contained, 
and that erroneous results were being obtained in 
gas producer and gas engine work where these in
struments were found in use.
One of the most marked defects in the calorim
eter outfits was found due to inaccurate themometers. The various users of gas calorimeters in 
Wisconsin may have these defects remedied by the 
university experts. The department of chemical 
engineering has just made the announcement that ' 
it is in a position to calibrate accurately such calori
meter themometers as may be sent to it by users in 
Wisconsin. The State Railroad Commission, through 
the co-operation of this department, offers this ser
vice free of charge to public service companies in 
this state.
Investigation work along this line is to be continu
ed, and the chemical engineering department is co
operating with the railroad commission and the 
committee of the American Gas Institute in prosecut
ing this research work. Not only are the proper
ties of gaseous fuels being studied at the university 
laboratories, but solid and liquid fuels are also receiv
ing attention.
Wisconsin has the record of being the first state to 
prescribe a heating value as the standard for gas for 
fuel and illuminating purposes. Investigation 
showed that over ninety per cent of the gas is used 
for the heat that it is capable of developing. The 
old candlepower standard is therefore wholly indequate. It is predicted that the universal standard 
of the future will be that based upon the heat unit. 
A recent report of the Public Utility Commission of 
New York suggests that an investigation is under 
way looking toward a change of standard in that 
state.
Professor Burgess has been assisted in his work by 
Professors J. L. Dickerman and O. L. Kowalke, in co
operation with a committee appointed by the Ameri
can Gas Institute, consisting of R. B. Brown, of 
Milwaukee; J. B. Klump, of Philadelphia, and Pro
fessor Burgess.

AMONG MEN.
When mamma says, Boys, go to bed,"
We say, We dont want to go now!
But when daddy says, Go to bed,
Youd oughter to be there an see how 
We kick off our shoes an our pants,
An dont stop to argue or fuss, 
An ma looks at daddy an smiles 
An' we know the joke is on us.
An mornins ma comes to the stairs,
An tells us an tells us its late.
An we just roll over and stretch,
An snuggle down comfy and wait 
Until she has called us again,
An again, an again, an again,
An till she starts cornin upstairs,
An' we dont hustle much even then.
But when Sunday morning is come,
An dad hasnt gone off to town,
An he hollers, Boys! at the stair,
You can hear our bare feet plunkin down 
On the floor by the side of our bed,
An we go at our things with a buzz 
An you bet we git into our clothes 
As fast as a fireman does.
An dad is the goodest old dad!
He plays with us just like a chum.
He tells about fishes hes caught,
An tells about trees he has dumb,
An tells' of when hes run away
From school, till we sit up an stare!
But if we run away like he did
We know what hed give usand where.
We dont know which one we love best,
An still we dont love em the same;
A mothers a mother, an when
We are men, an when truble has came, 
Well fight an well work for her, too,
An scheme an contrive an well plan 
To keep her a-laughin an glad,
But daddywell, daddys a man.
