BUREAU LISTS 
STUDY METHODS
Professors Suggest Helpful Habits in Studying For Exams
Just before the final examinations 
last spring the Carnegie Tartan 
published a list of suggestions by 
Carnegie professors for methods of 
studying for examinations. The 
unanimous admonition of nearly 
every professor at the conclusion 
of this article' was that the best 
time to study, for a final examina
tion is at the "beginning - -'of ; the 
semester.
Accordingly, with an eye for the 
advancement of Carnegie scholar
ship, the Carnegie Tartan is pub
lishing the following list of twentyone excellent rules which /the 
Bureau of Educational Research of 
the University of Illinois found 
were regularly practiced by a large 
group of honor students in college. 
These results have been recently 
published in "Engineering Educa
tion.
1. Systematically review the text
book before final examinations and 
quizzes.
2. Explain problems and processes 
for other students when there is an 
opportunity to do so.
3. Ask either in class or in con: 
fcrencc about items needing expla
nation.
4. Memorize rules and formulae 
only after thoroughly understand
ing them.
5. Read over an assignment rapid
ly to get a general idea of the 
authors treatment and then study 
in detail.
6. Recite 3rour lesson occasionally 
to yourself, either aloud or in a 
whisper.
7. S3rstematically review your text
book when 3'ou need facts pre
viously learned.
8. Try to determine the reasons 
for statements made by an author.
9. Tr}r to connect important 
points with something in your own 
experience.
10. Be 'sure that you clearly 
understand what your instructor 
aSks 3rou to do in his assign
ments.
11. Divide 3rour study of an as
signment into two periods.

Floyd Mills Twelve-Piece Recording Orchestra Will Play 
At Military Ball: Reduced Ticket Price, $2.50 Per Couple
The annual Military Ball will be 
held on the evening of Tuesday, 
November 10, from 9 oclock until 
one. After a long discussion, the 
committee, composed of Miles Kinley', 
chairman, Frank Stengle and Wil
lard C. Hallowa3', has decided to 
have, Floyd Mills recording orches
tra. It is a twelve piece band which 
has had considerable recognition in 
many parts of the country. Just re
cently the orchestra closed, a suc
cessful engagement on the Million 
Dollar Pier in Atlantic Cit3% Atlantic 
City Auditorium, Hunts Casino at 
Wildwood. It has also played at 
radio stations WGY, Schenectady, N. 
Y., WTAM, Cleveland, and WPC, At
lantic Cit3r. Scabbard and Blade, the 
sponsors of the Ball, were able to 
secure Floyd Mills orchestra for 
the occasion because it will be play-- 
ing in the vicinity of Pittsburgh at 
the time of the Ball. Otherwise it 
would have been impossible for them 
to secure an orchestra of its caliber 
and still chargc the reduced admis
sion price.
It is expected that the Ball will be 
held in the hew Union. To make this 
possible every effort is being made 
to complete the room; however, if 
it is not completed, the dance will 
be held in the old Union. A definite

Inasmuch as the Student Council 
has prohibited the giving of favors 
at any function on the Campus, it 
will be impossible to give favors at 
the Military Ball as in former years. 
Therefore in order to compensate 
for the lack of favors, the commit
tee has secured a better orchestra 
than is usualty secured for the affair. 
They have also reduced the price to 
$2.50 a couple.
Scabbard and Blade has invited 
many of the regular Army officers 
stationed in the vicinity of Pittsburgh 
to the Ball. 'It is hoped that many 
ofthem will avail themselves of the 
opportunity to attend the first formal 
dance given at Carnegie this year. 
An3r 'army uniform cr formal dress 
is correct for the occasion. It is ex
pected that a larger crowd will at
tend the Military Ball, the only mili
tary affair open tothe school at 
large, than has ever attended it be
fore.

-An EditorialA Real Victory
An inspired, courageous, Carnegie team proved last 
Saturday that a football victory may not always be measured by the bare figures of the points upon the scoreboard.
With the countrys newspapers carrying such headlines 
as; FIGHTING HEARTS WI^T CROWD TO TECIi 
TEAMTARTAN GRIDDERS ARE GLORIOUS IN 
DEFEATWITH BACKS TO WALL, TARTANS 
BATTLE VALIANTLY AGAINST HEAVY ODDS. 
Captain Armentrout and his charges obtained a victory of their own. As to whether or not such headlines are more 
precious thanSIWASH AGAIN SMASHES WEAK OP
PONENTS, 99-0USES BUT ONE VARSITY PLAY, ER, is a matter of opinion. However, considering football 
as truly a sport, means of a building character and spirit 
Carnegie feels no concern over her 'plight.
The ability to retain their fighting spirit in the face of 
any odds is a lesson learned by every Plaido team. Last 
Saturday fifty. thousand people left the Stadium with the latest splendid exhibition of this spirit remaining fixed in 
their minds, and in a manner that it will remain long after

PRINTING EXHIBIT 
AT CONVENTION
United Typothetae Votes to Continue Carnegie Donations
The Department of Printing at 
Carnegie took an active part at the 
Forty-fifth Annual Convention df 
the United Typothetae of America1 
recently held in New Orleans.
The Typothetae is a trade asso
ciation which includes a large pro
portion of the owners of mediumsized and large printing plants in 
the United States and Cajiada, and 
is particularly interested in matters 
of training and education. t has 
for some time maintained what is 
probably the most comprehensive 
program of education ever under
taken by an American trade asso
ciation. Because of this interest in 
education, the association, in 1927, 
established an endowment at Car
negie, and since that time has con
tributed $22,500 a year to the sup
port of the Department of Printing 
here.
Much favorable comment was 
heard at the convention regarding 
the interesting Carnegie exhibition 
which had been prepared by 
I-Iomer E. Sterling, instructor in 
the Department of Printing.
In connection with convention, 
the Committee on Education of the 
United Typothetae of America held 
its annual meeting under the chair
manship of E. Lawrence Fell of 
Philadelphia, who alsopresided at 
the general educational session of 
the convention. This committee 
considered several matters of par
ticular interest to Carnegie. It 
voted to continue the practice of 
making donations, each year, to 
the Typothetae Technical Library 
which has, been established for the 
use of the students and faculty of 
the Department of Printing. It 
also decided to continue the anual series of Typothetae lecturcs 
at Carnegie.
The Department of Printing was 
commended for the books which 
have been written during the year 
by members of the staff, and for 
the printing of important educa
tional material which has been 
used by the Typothetae organiza
tion. Printing Education, which is 
the only journal in the English 
language published in the interests 
of teachers of Printing, will again 
be printed at Carnegie and will be 
distributed in issues of 3,000 to 
teachers and students of Printing 
all over the world. A special cele
brationwill be held during the

This year in addition every student 
on the campus is requested to give 
at least one dollar. A card, on which 
will appear the name of the student, 
will be given to him, and he will 
return it with his donation of one 
dollar. The budgets of the local Y. 
M. & Y. W. C. A. arc also included 
in the fund, so part of the con
tributions will revert to the campus.
It is hoped that the sum raised in 
Allegheny County shall reach, or 
even exceed, the amount of $5,800,-
000. This money will be contributed 
to seventy-two different agencies in 
the city of Pittsburgh, and will also 
go towards the relief of unemploy
ment throughout the  country;.
Charids Schatvet is chairman of 
the drive in -Fine Aris, Engineers, 
and Industries; while Ruth Brooks 
is heading it in Margaret Morrison. 
It is hoped that every loyal studefit 
of Carnegie will give at least one 
dollar to the welfare drive.
As it is the object of the Associa
tion to serve the men and women 
of Carnegie regardless of creed, 
in every -possible way and to 
surround tlie students with such 
influence a s shall help the m 
to live clean lives, the "Y is 
asking the students to reciprocate in 
donating what they can to aid others 
during the present depression.

The Plebe football warriors 
met their first defeat of the sea
son in what was the last game 
of the year at the hands of the 
powerful Kiski eleven on Kiskis 
home field Friday afternoon. The 
final score was 27-12. Kiski scored 
the first touchdown early in the 
first period but this lead was 
quickly evened up when Joe Mihm 
crashed over the goal line from 
the six yard mark at the end of 
the first period. In the third peri
od Carnegie took the lead when a 
pass from Spisak to Carlson net
ted a touchdown. Kiski went into 
the lead when they were given 
the ball on Carnegies two yard 
line and in several plays converted 
it into a touchdown and by mak
ing. the point good. Thereafter 
several passes / netted two more 
touchdowns for the Prep school 
boys.
In the four games on the sched

UNK ANDERSONS CONVERSION of a score 
[L-Jj of questionable Irishmen into one of the bestM )| gridiron combinations was not the main attraction in the Stadium last Saturday. Our own Skibo mentors, incidentally losing by a 19 to 0 
score, added another layer to their reputation
v 1 ' of a liarci fi8htin team that p1uss away norv?./y matter what the score may be.With all due credit to Marchy Schwartz 
and his pair of shifty legs, our thoughts uncon- sciously revert to the band of eighteen red
jerseys that surpassed their brilliant performance against Pur
due.* * * * . *
THE GAME was not without its thrills that alternately 
brought each side of the Stadium into a furor of excitement. Schwartz's quick kick in the first quarter lifted the Irish' from 
a rather large hole by rolling seventy years along the side lines. 
A few minutes later Dueger climbed high in the air to interscept a pass that two Notre Dame players could easily have 
turned into a touchdown. Ostrosky brought his basketball skill into action when lie clamped Bevevinos accurate pass for a 
fifteen yard gain. The dimunitive quarterback also, made a first 
down with his fake pass in the final period.Captain Annentrout and George Kavel sponsored their 
usual share of ball toting. Chuck Ewing, playing his first big 
game, completely filled the shoes of OToole who was backing 
up the line.Steffen and Waddell will greatly miss the efforts of Lib 
Lewis and Clyde Iieinzcr who were injured in the fray. Lib'^ leg fracture will keep him from the grid togs for the remainder: 
of the season. Heinzer, suffered a knee injury and will surely 
be out for the Pitt game.* * * . * *
IT IS EASY TO REALIZE the desire that filled the boots 
of Lewis, Stewart, and Sample to bring Jaskwhich to earth after 
he had signalled for a fair catch of Armys punt. The trio had covered the ball to perfection and would have relished the 
tackle as a ham sandwich, but their obeyance of the rules 
saved the Skibo team from a penalty.

CARNEGIES BOXING TEAM has sounded the official call for both freshmen and varsity candidates for the coming 
winter season. Any students with the slightest inclination to
ward the ring sport should report to. the Trophy Room next Monday afternoon, November 0/ Coach Scsto will be present 
/to talk over plans and explain various points that pertain to 
the coming program,
Although intercollegiate boxing has enjoyed but one season of activity, the backing of the student body makes it ob
vious that this sport has advanced considerably in the given
This Saturday the Tartan ma
chine clashes once again at the 
Stadium with the Pitt elevens for 
the City of Pittsburgh champion
ship. Up to date the Blue and 
Gold aggregation have 13 wins to 
their credit against Carnegies four. 
Although past records many times 
figure, in the prediction of scores, 
they do not win games, and the 
one this week promises to be a 
struggle to the final whistle, Car
negies valiant struggle against 
Notre Dame last week gave con
clusive proof that the Scotchmen 
arc not just "another team. The 
Iron Men, although outclassed, 
fought a battle that won praise 
from writers and fans from all 
over the country, and their clean 
but vicious playing was one of the 
outstanding features of the game. 
19-0 is nothing to cry out about 
and lose heart.
Pitt-Tech games never have, and 
never will, be won until the final 
whistle. To each team the an
nual battle is one of the most im
portant to the entire schedule, 
and each would rather win this 
one than any other. Accordingly, 
cither team is liable to outdo it
self or play above its head.
. Teams To Stress Offense
So far this year Dr. Sutherlands 
boys have looked strong and very 
impressive in their games, and 
have shown strength in their run
ning and power plays. Heller and 
Reider are by far the mainstays 
in the backfield and their thrusts 
have been effective up to date. On 
the other hand Army and Kavel 
arc going to give the Pitt ends 
and their center of the line plenty 
of worries. Murrays wide end 
runs and Young Buck's subpcrb 
line plunges have been featured in 
cyery game and caused no pnd of 
trouble, while Ducgcrs passing 
deserves no little attention, cither.
Homecoming Game
It is without doubt that Car
negie students, alumni, and local 
fans arc going to witness an epic 
struggle to the end at this home
coming game, Pitts steam-rolling 
o' high' .scores will ho of little 
value since most of the points 
were piled up against comparat ivcly weak team s.__________________

ANNEX SECOND WIN
The varsity cross country team 
came through in great shape last 
Saturday, defeating the strong West
minster team by the decisive score of 
23-32. Captain Jess Price, won easily 
in the very fast time . of 28:46. 
Snially, Geneva star, and Coles, a 
teammate, tied for second. From 
then on it was all Tech; Ramsay 
and Schell tryin; for fourth, Allen 
fifth ancL Stankcy sixth.
An over-confident Plebe team al
most met defeat last Wednesday 
at the hands of a strong Schenley 
High outfit, but finally won out. 
Burke, freshman captain, won the 
race, but was closely followed by! 
two Schenley men. Blair was the 
second Tech man and Neff, after a 
great finish, was the third Skibo. 
Kulas and Hollingsworth also scored 
for the Plebes.
Saturdays win was the second this 
season for the varsity, without a de
feat. However, the hardest contests 
are yet to come. The Pitt meet 
originally scheduled for next Saturf

Parking, parking, parking, and no 
.ivliere to park. Thats a nice mess 
rto be in, isnt it? A couple issues 
back of the Tartan had .a great deal 
to say on this very prominent ques
tion. Whats a poor night student 
going to do if he cant find a place 
to park his omnibus. Ah! maybe the 
new course in Aircraft will, solve the 
question. They have developed a 
wind (pronounced with the long 
sound of I, like K in Carnegie) 
tunnel, on the campus so the next 
thing may. be a parking 'tunnel for 
(the motor buses. Who knowswe 
may. yet have some more brilliant 
engineers for you know they are so 
intelligent. Lets see what they can 
do.
Just heard a good story about an 
eelsomething like thisIt seems 
that a small boy had the extreme 
honor of catching' an eel which 
measured forty-four inches in length, 
imagine, and that it took the young
sters father and another man to 
help'land the wiggley thing. Then 
I also heard of a fisherman catching 
A bass which had swallowed a water 
'moccasin, and the snake was still 
Ulive when the fish was caught, as 
itvas proven when the tail was pulled 
put of the fishs mouth. Now I 
!have one
The yellow horses have disappeared 
from the campus and a beautiful set 
jof gates have been erected at each 
lend of the quadrangle which can be 
ppcned and shut to let those who 
arc privileged enter. This has raised 
a new hope of beautifying the cam
pus for which we 'Sife all happy. But 
this is a fish story.
Then, have you noticed that, the 
kvater fountain in Industries has 
'iiardly enough force behind it to 
.throw a stream of one-quarter of an 
i/ich long, this on the fWst floor; 
fy/iat must it be on the second floor 
-nothing. Lets, have something, to 
tfnnk at least even if ive do have 
fto rush out between classes.
The crowds have started to con
gregate at the book store again on 
certain nights and I am wondering 
(what the cause of it is. Maybe they 
Bont have enough help, or else the 
jpnes working there are not familiar 
{with the stock. Anyhow, I suppose 
(they will soon work out of this situa
tion and things will go along 
limoothly.
Speaking of books though, brings 
p pertinent question to iny mind and 
't/tat iswhy they change the text 
so often. Every year a new book 
f.r used for the same course. Of 
course, I will admit that changes 
must be made from time to time, 
but it docs seem reasonable to ex
pect that a text book should last 
'for three or four years before it 
becomes obsolete and a new one is 
necessary. But the changing of one 
every year hardly seem justifiable, 
Iexcept, well I suppose yon can sup
ply the answer, I cant.
I see that a new walk has been 
3aid along Woodlawn avenue at the 
Gym. I did think that it was time 
ito remove the pock-marked promen
ade which has been so long in' evi
dence at. this point. Somebody did 
make a mess of pouring the concrete 
.when the sidewalk was laid.
Suicides seem to be in order now, 
at least in art, that is, if you can 
_ take the price winner of the Inter
national seriously.- If that is art, I 
certainly would rather be a woodbutcher or some such occupation than 
pursue an art course even , if it docs 
cad one to fameI mean art. But 
Why go to the International for sug
gestions in art when we have them 
right here. Take for instance a 
wait in P. & D. Inspirations meet 
you in every direction. Just look at 
those problems after a judgment and 
you will be surprised.

NIGHT SCHOOL 
SOCIAL EVENTS
That the old axiom, All work 
and no play makes Jack a dull 
boy," is very applicable to the 
night student cannot be doubted. 
A year of night school would be a 
drab life indeed without some ex
tra curriculum activities to break 
the monotony. A short resume of 
what goes on on our night cam
pus during the year should be of 
interest to the first year students.
The Night College of Fine Arts 
sponsors three dances during the 
year. These dances have been 
very successful in the past years 
and every art student looks for
ward to each affair knowing full 
well that a good time is in store 
for him or her.
The Night College of Industries 
holds two smokers during, the 
school year and the degree of en
thusiasm and response shown at 
these two affairs cannot be rivaled 
by any other function.
In addition to two smokers, the 
Night College of Engineering 
Isolds a banquet which is one of 
the high spots of the years ac
tivities. The banquet is one of the 
oldest traditions on the campus 
and is dear to all the engineers.
Supplementing the functions of 
the three colleges, the Night Stu
dent Council sponsors four dances 
that are Unsurpassed by any other 
social affairs on the Carnegie 
Campus. A Thanksgiving recess 
dance, reflecting the spirit of that 
season, followed by the Post 
Holiday dance which is welcomed 
after the Christmas holidays. Next 
in order comes the Washingtons 
birthday dance with the spirit of 
the colonial days much in evi
dence, and the last affair of the 
social calendar, the Inter-Night 
College dance, .which completes a 
well arranged program of activi
ties.
In all, twelve social affairs are 
held' 011 the Night Campus for the 
night students, attendance at any 
one of wihch more than repays in 
social enjoyment. . This social cal
endar is outlined fully 011 page II 
of the Night Student Carnegie 
Handbook. Notices are also pub
lished in due time in the columns 
of the' Plaid page of the Carnegie 
Tartan.
The new student can readily sec 
that his social life on the campus 
is well taken care of and every
thing possible is . done to make his 
evenings at Carnegie enjoyable. 
Of course, to put these various 
programs over, a corps of workers 
is necessary, and these loyal work
ers are recruited from the ranks 
of .the night student body. In 
making the functions, possible it is 
necessary that various kinds of 
work have to be done both in 
preparation beforehand and the 
usual reding up, after the affair is 
held. As a reward for the -work 
done by the students, the Night 
Student Council has established an 
insignia award which is presented 
each year to those students wlio 
have earned it for faithful partici
pation.  .The work of the student 
is the sole factor in deciding the 
award as it is made only on a 
point basis. If any student feels 
that lie can participate in these 
activities, lie is requested to send 
in his name, address and college 
in which he is registered to the 
Night Student Council and an op
portunity will be given to work 
for the much coveted Night Stu
dent Council Insignia.

NIGHT ENGINEERS 
ELECT OFFICERS
Well Attended Smoker Was A Lively Affair
The students in the Night Col
lege of Engineerig elected their 
college officers at a smoker held 
Saturday evening, Octobcr 24, in 
the Union. The smoker was well 
attended and judging from  the. 
actions of the gathering, it was a 
very successful affair. Smokes, 
eats, music and vaudeville acts 
provided the evenings entertain
ment.
As the purpose of the smoker 
was to elect officers for the com
ing year, this formality was got
ten under way when a semblance
of order was secured. Various

DRAMA DEPARTMENT
(Continued from 1agc One), 
the nineties Pinero was supreme 
in the English theater,, and to this 
day he is regarded by certain 
critics as the best equipped and 
most skilful playwright of the 
English speaking world.
Pinero is master of the drama
tic forms lie has chosen to de
velop, and though others have had 
much more to say about life and 
have said it more subtly, lie will

The grim tragedy of the S-51 
has long since faded into the dim 
recesses of the publics mind. 
After, the usual cry for an investi
gation and the installation of ade
quate safety devices for the pro
tection of the men who man our 
submarines, the public forgot the 
gruesome fact that was soon overshadoAved by the more interesting, 
to the morbidly curious, murders, 
suicides, and what not.
Beneath all the shouting of the 
public and the mournful howling 
of the pacifistic politicians lies the 
quiet, unswerving bravery of the 
men who died and the men who 
did their best in vain to save 
them.
Rescue boats, on the scene soon 
after the first act of the tragedy 
occurred, .were hampered by icecold water, high seas, and other 
inconveniences, but they neverthe
less sent their divers overside to 
attempt the impossible many feet 
belpw the surface.
The darkness at the depth at 
which the wrecked submarine lay 
was intense. A hurried call was 
sent to a local concern for lamps 
that would both withstand the 
pressure of the water and give 
sufficient light to enable the div
ersto carry 011 the underseas res
cue work.
After several attempts the bulbs 
were developed within 24 hours, 
and while the climax of the trag
edy was a foregone conclusion, 
they served the divers well and 
greatly expedited their labors.
This would sCcm to be just an
other case of where brains and 
brawn combined gave an insuper
able combination; The bravery' of 
the divers and sailors who par
ticipated in the rescue work is 
not to be questioned, but crcdit 
must also be given to the scien
tists who so swiftly and aptly 
supplied the illumination for the 
under water work, thereby making 
the work of the rescuers consider
ably easier and faster and increas
ing the possibility of some of the 
victims being rescued1 alive. While 
the outcome of all the endeavors 
was no so fortunate as to save 
any of the trapped men, the lights 
dcvclop/ecl {vill ; undoubtedly be 
used to' very great advantage if 
unfortunately the occasion again 
arises. McG.

PRINTING EXHIBIT
(Continued from Page One) 
week of February IS, 1932, in all 
parts ' of the United States and 
Canada, in the interests of print
ing education. The Carnegie De
partment of Printing is expected 
to co-operate with the Pittsburgh 
unit of the Typothctae organization 
in arranging for a special celebra
tion of Printing Education Week.
The Committee 011 Education 
passed a resolution in recognition 
of the services which have been 
rendered to the printing industry 
by Harry L. Gage, who was head 
of the Department of Printing at 
Carnegie from 1^13 to 1919, and 
who has, since that time, served 
as a member of the Typothctae 
Committee 011 Education. Mr. 
Gage recently severed his'connec
tion with the Bartlctt-Orr Press 
of New York City to become vice 
president of the B. Altman Com
pany of New York.

A Campus Stroll
Yes, its good to be back after 
the several months absence from the 
campus and to wander through the 
corridors. And the Arts school is 
truly a great place to be. Except for 
a few minor changes it is much the 
same as last year. Lets take a stroll 
around and see who arc. back and 
who arent. According to all the well 
regulated rules one must start at 
the bottom and work upcxccpt in 
the exciting occupations of well sink
ing and grave digging where the re
verse is true and perhaps my tour 
of Arts. Well start at the top and 
P. & D. CORRIDORS INTER
ESTINGA walk through the P. 
and D. corridors was perhaps  the 
most interesting from the stand
point of variety. While admiring the 
charcoal drawings on the walls who 
should come my way but Gossic 
good old Gossic. "Hi, old man, how 
was the summer, still working, etc., 
etc." And then, of all people 
Hello Margy whatcha doin here 
you looking for room 303Oh I your 
girl friends looking for it tooand 
your resting; well theres the room 
and Ill be seeing you." A few more 
feet up the corridor and Hello, 
Flo," I sec your backnonoI 
mean your back in school. Naw 
your dress isnt tornheh, hch, great, 
well both go out and try one some 
evening. "Well, theres Andy, the 
check room boy, a former architect 
gone P. & D."
ARCHITECTS GIVE RECEP
TION The architects rendezvous 
was the next stopping place and what 
a reception they gave me. Frannic, 
Herbie and Martic formed the re
ception committee but by degrees the 
crowd grew till the order of the 
evening was exchanging banter and 
shaking hands. J.ust then Jonnic 
claimed that that reminded him of 
one and immediately someone had to 
throw open the windows. However, 
this didnt last long because the air 
got too thick so I had to leave be
fore I suffocated.
Im going to quit this folks. I feel 
weak after that session and I dont 
believe I could look anyone in the 
eye and feel comfortable, so me for 
the office and an easy chair and 
Ill see you some other time.

Welcome Alumni
The homecoming celebration lor ail Carnegie alumni 
will be held during the coming week-end. The lartan, acting for the student body, -welcomes the graduates' and 
wishes them a pleasant reunion.Special attention is directed to a change in the usual 
order of the events of the homecoming program. ^ The 
ceremony in the foyer of Administration hall that is co
incident with the laying of the reunion plates as part of 
the design for the alumni clan, will be held Friday after
noon instead of Saturday morning.The creation of this visible record of the alumni classes is a worthwhile tradition, and the type of service which 
helps lend the flavor of age to a school which is still rela
tively young.*****
Parking Problems
The lack of parking' space this year still continues to 
cause no little sentiment ampng the students. It is very evident that more cars arc parked on the campus this year 
than ever before. Since the enforcement of the state law, 
banning parking on curves on Woodlawn avenue and Park boulevard, many car drivers must seek parking space in 
out-of-the-way places or even off the campus. Night school 
students especially arc affected by the forbiddcncc of park
ing on Park boulevard. ^ .Some space between Machinery and Engineering Hall is 
available, but it is entirely inadequate at the present time, 
especially on rainy days. The Situation is acute and neces
sitates some change in existing conditions. As a first step markers two feet long and several inches wide placed car 
widths apart and six or eight feet from the curb could be painted on Woodlawn avenue. These markers would en
tail a minimum of expense arid they would serve as well 
as complete lines extending from tliecurb.Until markers are painted and other steps taken to pro
vide better facilities, car drivers must co-operate by parking 
their cars as close together as possible. It is a matter of 
courtesy and fairness to other car drivers. J. L.* * * * *
College Culture
Pitt WeeklyThe middle-aged alumnus whose favorite recreations are 
still football games and musical comedies, familiar though he may be in fact and in fiction, is apparently, after all, not 
typical of his kind.A recent survey conducted in Brooklyn shows that with 
almost robot-like exactitude the more education a person has, the higher in the cultural and intellectual scale are his 
recreational pursuits. According to the findings of this study, the typical individual' of elementary schooling seldom 
enters a public library or an art museum, reads no philos
ophy, economics, and practically 110 fiction, and is likely to be addicted to the sensational type of newspaper. The typi
cal college graduate, on the other Tiand, uses libraries and 
art museums, attends serious drama, reads fiction, biography, 
and science. No college graduate was found in the survey who confined his newspaper reading to. tabloids.
While this survey was made in Brooklyn, there is no 
reason to doubt DUnn tiie same results would be obtained 
should it be conducted among Pitt students. This should stifle some of the alarmists who have long been bewailing 
the tastes of college students. On paper the findings look like a slot-machine process with the moral of the story be
ing that the larger the educational coin put in, th^ choicer 
the product which comes out.* *  * * * 
Undergraduate Anxiety
PiT. I. T. WeeklyIn an address recently before a body of young men, 
a gentleman of note maintained that 110 man worries during his lifetime as much as when he is in school. His claim 
is that the average young man at a university or college be
comes so bound up in his curricular work that he overtaxes 
his mind. Of this the student is practically'unaware, but the Technology undergraduate must admit that the Institute 
occupies the greater portion of his mental efforts, and right
ly so.
The ultimate effect of this constant mental strain, for 
it is a strain, whether we admit it or not, is the develop
ment of a pessimistic point of view. Men of the business world today are all inclined to look for the worst, and to 
anticipate and prepare for reverses. This attitude certainly 
has its beneficial points, especially from the individuals 
standpoint. The intricate operations of the stock market and 
the continual fluctuations of price, are controlled more by the whims and hunches of worrying"business men than theyarc by purely material circumstances.
Undergraduate anxiety provides excellent training for the mind of the coming industrialist or financier. Doubtless, 
it seems a bit far-fctchcd to assert this, but if one follows the though through, it will be easily perceived that study
ing for an EEE examination will someday be of-use to'us 
when we are debating whether to fill our wheat elevators or sell General Motors short.

their social fee in the form of their Halloween

with dorm receipts but were not prepared for the 
gate keeper's query, Wheres your room key?
. . . The posters advertising the dance read Greek

dance of the year . . . The committee thumbed
its nose at the Student Council and gave favors 
in the form of horns. They even had programs

second team this time . . . Good thing Tech has 
some backficld men who can tackle . . . No 
breaks for Tech as usual ... A drizzle that 
promised to make the game miserable but soon 
gave up . . . The Bugle Corps monopolizing most 
of the half period with repetitions of their very' 
smart drill and the same tune . . . Finally the 
Kilties and their flashing spats. The confetti 
shamrock. The balloon ascension. The Kilties 
chased off the field by the players . . . Lewis 
done up with a bad compound fracture in his leg. 
Best of luck with it Libby . . . Tech tightening 
up in the second half and holding the Irish to 
no further score . . . The disheartening effect of 
a. whole new Notre Dame team in one substitu
tion . . . Some real tackling by Tech men . . . 
A few passing thrills ... A few in the crowd 
getting well likkcred . . . The final whistle . . . 
A swell game in spite of the score . . .* * * * *
Frat Flaunts Firemen
The Delt boys were tidying up around the 
house one fine fall day. Having amassed a heap 
of leaves theyindulged in ye ancient game of leaf

the firemen to

see what they
could do about it. The brave fire-eaters arrived 
011 the scene with considerable tordo and in due 
course subdued the blaze. One of the Delts -had 
to have his little joke so very ceremoniously ap
peared before the firemen bearing a tray on whfch 
reposed a lighted cigarette and implored the fire 
laddies to extinguish the blaze. The Captain de

MOVIES AND CLASSES

If 3rou were to pay .fifty 
cents to sec a movie and the

would be no show that, night 
you would be disappointed 
and demand 3rour money

If you were to pay fifty

would be 110 class that day, 
you would probably let out 
a joyqus yell and forget 
about the fifty cents that it 
cost you.
You would no't be pleased 
at paying three dollars for 
six movies during the win

- any of them.
Why,. then, do you take 
three dollars worth of your

Every class costs you
money and is worth real
money to you. Watch j'our

More On Golf
 Golf - is. rapidly taking its stand . as 
an important .sport in inter-collegiate 
circles. There is no real reason why 
agolf team representing Carnegie 
cannot be formed. The public course 
is near by " and with the short 
schedules that many of the students 
have it is. an eas}' thing to practice 
after hours. The problem of a coach 
is not so important as it seems. 
Any - student who considers himself 
capable of making a golf team, who
ever he may be, will profit little 
from professional coaching. On the
other hand there will probably be 
one or more of the candidates who 
knows enough about golf to cor
rect the most glaring faults. Pre
liminary rounds can be played to 
decide the personnel of the team.
It is my opinion, and also that of 
the-other golfers of the school, that 
the only way to decide this question 
is to give it a fair trial. If the first 
season docs not meet with popular 
approval it can be discontinued. I 
am sure that golf at Carnegie can 
and will become a popular sport.

12. Do each, assignment with dis
patch, but . complete all work.
13. Be sure to find out the mean
ing of unfamiliar terms.
14. Write-.upchemistry experi
ments inthe labratory with the 
experiment all set up.
15. If you do not understand how 
to proceed in solving a problem 
after reading it, .try to reason out 
the procedure or. look up the solu
tion to similar problems, preferably, 
the former.
16. When doing an experiment, 
read through and try to understand 
all of the directions before begin
ning to work; do not merely read 
the directions as the experiment 
progresses.
17. Understand exactly what is 
given and what is to be done before 
you begin to solve a problem.
18. Read' your textbook relative 
to the subject matter of. a labora
tory experiment before doing the 
experiment.
19. Apply rules and formulae soon 
after learning them, rather than 
trust that you will remember them 
without doing this.
20. If a problem is made up. of 
a series of steps, be careful to 
separate it into the several steps.
21. When possible checkyour 
answers to^ problems. Check each 
operation as performed rather than 
leaving all the checking until the 
entire -problem is completed.
The Bureau of Educational re
search also found that there were 
several study habits that are often 
advocated by authorities, but which 
few students ever follow. These 
are:
1. Follow a fairly definite study 
schedule.
2. As you read, keep notes in 
some systematic way, such as in a 
notebook.
3. After studying an assignment, 
write out a summary or outline of 
the material read.
4. Systematically review your text
book daily.
SERIOUSLY SPEAKING

strain. Again mayors and gang
sters have been booed at their 
public appearances.
Nevertheless, one is struck by
the futility and docility of student 
organizations and occupations in 
the face of the stirring perturba
tions in industry, government and 
life of our times. An immense 
challenge to our energies and 
thoughts is thereby thrown us. 
And we continue to haze unsus
pecting freshmen, publish comic 
magazines, program endless func
tions, splash all our talent on end 
rtins and forward passes.
You cant counter altogether by 
declaring this to be the natural 
psychology of the teens. It is 
only an expression of the jejune 
high-jinks of American frontier 
life in general.

The Womens Junior Prom, with 
the exception of the Men's Junior 
Prom, is to be the only affair -that 
will be held off the campus this 
year. This fact is in accordance 
with the recent action taken by 
Student Council in reducing the 
costs of campus affairs.
This year the price of admission 
to the Womens Junior Prom will 
be half the cost of former years. 
Formerly a junior woman paid 
for her ticket and also for the 
ticket for her senior - year. When 
the junic/r became a senior she 
was entertained by the junior 
class.
Last j'car Student Council, with
a sufficient surplus from former 
Junior Proms, appropriated a fund 
for this 3ears womens prom. The 
mone3- will be spent for the enter
tainment of the women of the 
class of 1931. Thus the policy of 
women paying for a ticket to only 
nne Junior Prom will be inaugu
rated by the present junior wom
en.

For the same reason that OLD
