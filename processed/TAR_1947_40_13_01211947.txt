Tartan Elects 
Managing Editor
Dick Eschenbach was elected 
managing editor of the Tartan at 
a meeting of the Editorial board, 
the newspapers governing body, 
held last Wednesday. Dick, for
merly news editor of the paper, 
replaces Ben Schwartz, who has 
been made faculty advisor far the 
publication.
Other appointments made by 
the board include Tony Arrott as 
news editor, and Andy Cantini as 
sports editor. New members of the 
copy staff are Harry Silverman 
and Dale Wright. Hubert Aaronson is the new personnel man
ager.
Fred Johnson and Bob Abelson 
were promoted from cub to full 
reporters on the basis of their 
work as cubs. New cub reporters, 
who have demonstrated their in
terest and ability in newspaper 
work are Ainslie Bricker, Lois 
Sloan, Marjorie Powers, Midge 
Teague, Bea Patterson, Ange Poilis, and Dorothy Gerken.
Battle On For Beauty King
Beauty parlors are doing a rushing business, mirrors 
are working overtime, gallons of foul-smelling shaving lo
tions are being sold, cameron plaids are being featured 
here come Carnegie Techs bee-oo-tiful men, candidates 
for the King of Hearts.
A new twist to an old practice will be the theme of 
the Mortar Board-sponsored King of Hearts ball on Febru
ary 8 in the mens gym. Furnishing the music for this all
school semi-formal dance will be Joey Sims and his or
chestra. Tickets are two dollars per couple and flowers are 
optional.
Carnegie Tech has always honored its beautiful women 
as Thistle Queen, Bond Queens, or as members of the senior 
court, but no one has ever paid much attention to the poor 
boys. Every dog, however, must have his day, so for the 
second time (last years ball overflowed Webster Hall) one 
lucky man will be crowned king.
All-School Election
An all-school election will be held on Friday, February 
7, from 11:30 to 1:30, to pick the king.
Only 200 couples were expected last year but 500 at
tended and crowded Webster Hall to the hilt. As Mortar 
Board is expecting approximately 700 couples to attend 
this year, they hope to use the profits to sponsor scholarships.

Semesters End
A semesters end, aside from meaning examinations, grades, 
and reregistration, is an insignificant occasion for most of the 
student body. Unlike a years end it brings with it few changes.
However, the conclusion of this semester finds the Tartan 
losing two of its responsible members, the co-editor, Mary Jane 
Horridge, and the managing editor, Ben Schwartz.
It seems only proper than a:t this time to show our appre
ciation for their efforts and enthusiasm.
Mary Jane, who has resigned becuse of an overweighted 
schedule in her curricular and extra-curricular activities, edited 
the news end of this paper. To her fell most of those unspec
tacular jobs which required time and patience. Without her 
the editorial chair is going to seem awfully empty.
Ben, as a post graduate, relinquishes his job to become a 
faculty advisor. Thus in one sense, he will still be with us; yet, 
as a managing editor who handled all the many exasperating 
crises with common sense and good judgment, he will be irre
placeable.
Fortunately, those who remain on the staff show ability and 
capability and those who have recently been added are promis
ing workers. With the help of these people, we shall do our best 
to give you a better Tartan next semester. B. L. 6.

Have You Had 
Kittens Lately?
Dramatically inclined kittens 
are first on the help-wanted lists 
this week.
The request comes from the 
Drama department, which is in 
dire need of two live kittens for 
the coming production of You 
Cant Take It With You.
Anyone who knows of two the
atrically-minded kittens, with or 
without experience, is requested 
to get in touch with Iris Hilton, 
Nancy Lee, or Virginia Burgwin.
The kittens will be treated as 
talented kittens should, with the

but even if the kittens arent

The Passing Parade
Dec. 17 (Delayed)
There are dire forebodings in 
the air, this week, concerning the 
fate of one of the most progressive 
ideas in American industry. The 
story centers about the colorful 
William S. Jack Bill Jack to his 
employees.
Once W. S. Jack received quite 
a kicking around. He was a ma
chinist, alone, out of work, down 
to his last dollar. He had to 
grovel and demean himself to get 
a job, had to take abuse and cruel 
ridicule from hardened foremen. 
Bill Jack thought it neither hu
mane nor sensible to make a man 
feel like a cur for the privilege of 
working. After all, he thought, 
theyre not doing me a favor by 
letting me work for them.
These are not uncommon 
thoughts, especially for a man who 
is practically penniless. What is 
remarkable is that W. S. Jacks 
ideas hadnt changed thirty years 
later when he was president of a 
firm doing $84,000,000 worth of 
business a year, Jack and Heintz. 
He really set precedents in the 
way of employer-employee rela
tions.
First of all, each employee re
ceives the title associate, the 
title W. S. Jack himself holds. 
Then the newcomer is made to 
feel that the firm spends sleepless 
nights worrying about his well
being. He listens to indoctrination 
lectures, the idea of which,is that 
he is a partner in the firm, not 
hired help. He is given ortho
pedic shoes, gold teeth, life and 
accident insurance, and a drink
ing cup with his name embossed 
in gold letters. At work the as
sociate gets free hot lunches, and 
he can amble over for a cup of 
coffee (free) whenever he feels 
like it. He is exhorted via the 
loudspeaker to take time off for a 
Turkish bath (free) on company 
time.
What a paradise for goldbrickers!
But strangely enough, as Bill 
Jack expected, no one wants to 
loaf. Instead, efficiency per man 
skyrocketed and Jack and Heintz 
found itself with creamy profits 
that it raked back to the associBy Carl Klahr
ates via bonuses, extra bonuses, 
and turkey for the holidays.
But last March Bill Jacks com
pany merged with another firm. 
This brought in a new board of 
directors, who viewed the radical 
personnel policy with suspicion. 
This week the big explosion came. 
After a stormy board meeting a 
Cleveland newspaper quoted Mr. 
Jack as saying that the directors 
may fire me but Ill never quit, 
after he had said that he was in
volved in a dispute over his hu
man relations program. Last 
Tuesday, under a thin veil of dis
guise, the board of directors gave 
W. S. Jack a years leave of ab
sence.
I hope they reconsider. Jacks 
innovations are not the ideas of 
a crackpot, but a method of in
creasing production by raising the 
workers moralea method just 
as scientific as other technological 
improvements. No less an author
ity than the personnel staff of 
Western Electric Co. will verify 
this.

Chicago, of Western Electric Co.

tions on the employees to deter

tightly sealed world, shielded 
from any real appreciation of the 
Outside by a perfect screen of 
super-sensitive thought flow which 
automatically collates, classifies, 
and stores only those impressions 
which bear on the sensual success 
of Me.
But anomalous Mary will some
times forget to wait for a man to 
open the light screen door in front 
of her and will open it herself, 
too impatient to be on her way 
and too preoccupied with other 
problems to worry about the im
pression she is making on some
one else who happens to be one 
of the opposite sex.
This occupation of a normally 
capable-mind with at least semi
personal affairs in addition to the 
conventional trivia extends to the 
use of an English major (with a 
secretarial minor in reserve) on 
two of the campus publications, 
the Thistle as Associate Editor in 
1945 and the Scottie as Womens 
Editor this year, and to the prob
able continuation of this work as 
an advertising copy writer in 
some post-graduation job.
These inclinations and constant 
active participation in life are 
reflections of neither extraordi
nary brilliance nor of an un
usual outlook on life. Certain 
conservative surface tendencies, 
such as a fondness for classical 
and semi-popular music and a 
sharp distaste for exhibitionism, 
combined with a surprisingly lib
eral view of the fixed striations 
of ideology whose very solid 
forms seal in our intellectual existance so well, do however, com
prise the background of a con
siderably clearer personality than 
might be expected from the usual 
pretty girl.
An instinctive application of 
leadership principles, an ability 
to bring others over to her point 
of view, and an almost invisibly 
unresilient outer personality trace 
other surfaces of this cool-charm
ing girl. But at other moments, 
her light femininity will easily 
and often display a soft and taste
ful beauty much akin to that of 
the quiet, scintillating sapphire 
which is the Blue Grotto of the 
Isle of Enchantment, whose shim
mering depths blur into time the

ESDAY, JANUARY 21, 1947THE CARNEGIE TARTAN3
The Three Sisters
The drama department began 
the new year very auspiciously 
[with its production of Chekhovs 
[he Three Sisters, the fourth play 
)f the season.
Like all plays by the great RusIsian author, this one is highly 
I philosophical and rather depress
ing. It brings us some episodes 
from the lives of. a few people 
fighting a seemingly losing strug
gle against fate and themselves. 
And, as their misery deepens and 
all their plans and hopes are shat
tered by adverse conditions, they 
are sustained only by their falter
ing groping towards the belief 
that there must be a reason, an 
ulterior motive and justification, 
for all their suffering.
The Story 
The three sisters who give the 
play its name are the orphaned 
daughters of a Russian general. 
Born and brought up amidst the 
splendor and culture of Moscow, 
they move, at an early age, to a 
provincial town, a Russian Zenith, 
where their education finds no 
outlets. From the very beginning 
of their new residence they have 
but one wish  to return to Mos
cow . . . but something always 
happens to prevent this, and slow
ly but surely they see themselves 
grasped in the ever tightening 
tentacles of profession and mar
riage. Day after day they sink 
deeper into the dulling routine of 
small town life.
The Sisters 
Olga, the eldest sister, is a 
teacher and, in spite of her dis
taste of the job, rises to the posi
tion of headmistress. At eighteen, 
the second sister, Masha, married 
a schoolteacher to whose appar
ent wisdom and knowledge she 
looked up with great respect. 
Soon, however, she recognizes 
that her husband is only a pe
dantic, though goodhearted, bore. 
After a brief interlude of happiness 
in her love towards the local gar
rison commander, sherealizes when 
he leaves that there is no escape 
from her life. The youngest of the 
trio, Irina, also longs to return to 
Moscow where she is certain to 
find a Prince Charming to love 
and marry. But at last she sees 
the futility of her expectations 
and consents to marry a recently 
retired officer living in the town. 
On the eve of her marriage he is 
killed in a duel and so Irina, like 
her sisters, is left alone with the 
fragments of her shattered hopes. 
Personal Triumph 
The current production of the 
play was a personal triumph for 
Sada Thompson. As Masha she 
gave one of the most memorable 
and nearly perfect performances 
seen on this stage in a long time. 
Throughout the performance she 
asserted the outstanding qualities 
of Mashas character with a sub
tle understatement and remark
able economy of movement which 
were extremely impressive. At no
time did one feel that she had 
reached the peak of her emotions, 
and this lent to her performance 
a thrilling sense of power and 
vibrant aliveness.
George Wood was excellent as 
Kuligan. Mashas husband. He 
brought out to the fullest extent 
the humor of this character; yet 
he managed to convey the pa
thetic qualities of a man who 
loves his wife, knows that he is 
not loved by her, but nevertheless 
is grateful to her for having mar
ried him.
Supporting Cast
In the other cast, M&sha was 
played exceedingly well by Ruth 
Guberman. Barbara Marshs Olga 
and Liz MacDonalds Irina were 
equally competent, and both Carl 
Betz and Louis Edmonds perform
ed outstandingly as Mashas lover, 
Vershinin. Joseph Schlafman lent 
to the difficult part of Solyoni 
plausibility and consistency of 
character. Tuzenbach, Irinas in
tended husband, was played by 
Mitch Agruss with the excellence 
one could expect from the Cauchon in Saint Joan.
Engineers Can 
Learn to Speak
A public speaking course with 
no credits assigned will be offered 
next semester by the department 
of humanistic and social studies 
for engineering students wishing 
to gain a knowledge of speech 
techniques.
The course has been set up on 
a trial basis to fill the engineers 
need for training in speaking abi
lity and has been planned to con
tain about ten or twelve one-hour 
classes over the semester. The 
classes will probably start about 
two weeks after registration for 
the coming semester. There will 
be one meeting a week with a 
minimum of outside preparation.
Students interested in enrolling 
in this course should send a card 
with their names, addresses, and 
phone numbers to Ernie Snoyer, 
Box 367, through intra-school 
mail.

Trimble Presents 
Original Works
An enthusiastic audience gave 
Lester Trimble two curtain calls 
following the first public perform
ance of his Three Pieces for 
String Orchestra by the Pitts
burgh Symphonietta, Tuesday 
evening, January 14, in Carnegie 
Music hall.
Les, a junior in the department 
of music, has resumed his studies 
in composition under Professor 
Nikolai Lopatnikoff after serving 
more than two years in the Army 
Air Corps. Founder and conduc
tor of the Symphonietta is Henry 
Mazer, also a student in the music 
department at Carnegie.
The three pieces by Trimble are 
titled Fast, Slow, and Fast, ^nd 
are distinctly modern in style* 
They were given a distinctive pre
sentation by the SyrrLphonietta, 
and the audiences enthusiasm 
was well merited.
The first movement was quite 
animated, the second more lyri
cal and dreamy, while the third 
returned to the tempo of the first, 
featuring some rather tricky rhythym changes. Local music critics 
have recommended that the piece 
be included in the program of the 
Pittsburgh Symphony, which is 
ample indication of the regard in 
Which they hold the composition.
Letters
According to a state law, 
the identity of the authors of 
all letters published must be

4THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, JANUARY 21, 1947
Wild Bill Scores At Last, Case Falls
Penn State 
Wins 71-45
The Tech Basketeers winning 
streak of one straight was brought 
to a loud and screeching halt at 
the Skibo gym Saturday night as 
the Penn State Lions derailed the 
Tartan Victory Special by a score 
of 75-41. As the saying goes, the 
best team won, but from the 
bleachers it looked as if the best 
team might easily have been on 
the short end of the score.
There were times when the 
slow-moving State team was com
pletely baffled by the long over
due fast break, and that alone 
kept Tech within hailing distance 
for all except the last few minutes 
of the game. If somebody had 
been able to hit consistently from 
outside, the 800 fans present 
might have been sitting in on a 
stunning upset.
State Starts Scoring
Penn State had scored three 
points before George Meyer stole 
the ball under the State basket 
to open the Tech scoring with a 
two-pointer. Rusinko then sank 
a foul and hit from the middle 
before Chetlin collected a foul 
and Katselas broke down the 
middle for a lay-up to bring the 
score to 6-^5 and necessitate the 
Lions to take a time out to mar
shal their forces.
When the game was renewed 
Meyer again clicked to put the 
Tartans in the lead for the first 
and only time during the game. 
After that the Lions took things 
in their own hands and ran the 
score up to 20 points with only 
Katselas able to find the range 
as he hit the cords for two field 
goals.
By the middle of the second 
quarter Katselas had collected 
four personal fouls and had to re
strict his efficiency for the rest 
of the game in order to avoid the 
clincher. For the remainder of 
the half State continued to roll 
with an amazing exhibition of set 
shot shooting. Only Matsey was 
able to hit consistently for the 
Skibos as he rang up five points. 
A little more adeptness at the 
foul circle would probably have 
doubled that number. The half 
ended with State in the lead by 
a score of 32-20.
Tartans Spurt
The second half started as 
though Tech had received a shot 
of adrenalin during the intermis
sion. Matsey and Chetlin hung 
up two quick goals to bring the 
Skibos to within eight points of 
the leaders. The venerable state 
zone defense then tightened up 
and the Skibos found it increas
ingly difficult to move the ball 
around as they had during the 
first half. It was at this time that 
the Tartans might have pulled 
themselves into the ball game by 
being able to hit from the outside. 
But it seemed as though the 
grounds keepers had forgotten to 
take the lid off the basket after 
the half-time festivities. No mat
ter how hard they tried, nothing 
would go-in.
State Pulls Away
In the meantime State was ex
periencing little difficulty in find
ing the basket and started to pull 
away from the hapless Tartans. 
Led by the sterling pivot play of 
big Jim Rusinko and the deadly 
sniping of the rest of the team, 
the Lions made the gap bigger 
and bigger as the Skibos started 
to disintegrate. Katselas, Klein 
and Chetlin hit for six points 
apiece during the period, but this 
was not enough to keep the Ski
bos in the ball game. With about 
five minutes left in the game 
Coach Donahue decided that he 
might just as well use a lost cause 
to do some good and ran in the 
splinter brigade /or some season
ing. The game ended at 71-45.
For the Tartans much credit 
must again go to big George 
Meyers, whose all-around play 
has been the highlight Co a poof 
KdSOft. ____
Katselas In Action
Intramural Roundup
For the second straight week 
there has been plenty of action 
on the alleys. This time it was the 
Spare and Turkey leagues fur
nishing the excitement.
In the Spare league the big 
three, Betas, Tau Delts and Delts, 
made a clean sweep of all their 
games to keep the top spot still 
undecided. This means that the 
next matches, when the Delts and 
SAEs meet the Tau Delts and 
Betas, will be crucial events. The 
Delts, led by Kingpin Ted Drabers, set a new record when they 
beat the Kilroy A.C. with a three 
game total of 2459 pins.
Beta Sigs Still Lead
In the Turkey League the Splits 
and T.X.s are still breathing fire 
on the heels of the league-leading 
Beta Sigs. The Splits took three 
games from Sigma Nu while the 
T.X.s won the same number from 
the wanless Combine-3. This en
abled them to move up a game 
on the Beta Sigs, who lost a game 
to the Phi Kaps.
In the remaining match the 
Delt-2 took all three games from 
the PiKAs to move into fourth 
place, just three games out of 
first.

Foul Shooting 
Last week the finals were com
peted in the foul-shooting con
test, with the Tau Delts taking 
top honors. The Tau Delts turned 
in a total of 342 baskets out of a 
possible 500. The PiKAs were 
runners-up with 335 baskets. 
Buddy Yorkin of the Tau Delts 
won individual honors with 78 
baskets out of a possible 100. Bob

a total of 77.
Skibo Streak Snapped At Six Straight 
Attention Mr. Ripley: Score 51-43
Wild Bill Donohoe, after five months of trying to win for his 
alma mater, finally did it last Wednesday night when his boys snapped 
a six-game losing streak by stopping victory-starved Case, 51-43, be
fore a meager crowd of 500 relatives in the local gym.
Some one had to win. Case has yet to break into the plus column 
this year. For the Tartan five it was the first victory since March 2, 
1946, when they defeated another Case team which had taken but 
one contest all season.
It was a big night for Tasso Katselas, the East Pittsburgh flash, 
who turned on his radar set long enough to hit the hoop for five field 
goals and a half dozen charities. For Tommy Culbertson it was the
last night. Culbertson, who en--------------------------------------------------
tered the hospital near the end of 
the week suffering from exhaus
tion, scored eight points in his; 
final appearance.
Case Takes Lead
Case started the game off with 
a foul shot and a field goal. Mel 
House broke the ice for the home 
team with a two-pointer and, af
ter Mel Klein had tied it at five 
all, House scored again to give 
the Tartans a 7-5 advantage.
Case came back on field goals 
by Kanda and Fishley. Culbert
son sank a charity shot. Then 
Case extended their lead to 10-8 
when Klein committed his fourth 
foul. Kanda split the cords for 
Case, Katselas dropped a foul shot 
through the bucket and hit from 
the outside, and as the quarter 
ended the Tartan team trailed
11-12.
Tartans Catch Up
The second quarter it was all 
Plaid. Fishley and Tanis made the 
visitors only points as six fouls 
and baskets by Riehl and Matsey 
gave the home team a 21-16 lead 
at half-time.
Coach Donohoes boys saw their 
chance to win and proceeded to 
extend their margin to 27-19. Case 
called time, gave themselves a pep 
talk, and came back to take the 
lead at 29-27. It was still any
bodys game.
Katselas tied it again and little 
Marty Chetlin put the Tartans 
ahead with a foul. Fishley sank a 
charity shot for Case to retie it.

out in front to stay with another 
foul. That was on Fishleys fifth 
and final miscue.
The final period was merely a 
matter of extending the margin 
of victory. Klein managed to last 
to mid-way in the quarter before 
he added the last to the series of 
fouls he had started in the opening 
minutes of the game. With sec
onds to go Case trailed 38-51 but 
they managed to climb to within 
eight points of the Tartans as the 
final score read 51-43.

TUESDAY, JANUARY 21, 1947THE CARNEGIE TARTAN5
ORCHIDS AND ANDYLINES
\ By Andy Cantini
Once upon a timeMarch 2, 1946, to be exacta team represent
ing Curly Dohertys De-emphasis Program Inc. traveled to the 
metropolis of Cleveland, Ohioa distance of 903' hours by pogo stick. 
In this fair city the team was not only presented with the latest 
password to the best dives, but also a victory over its Ohio coun
terpart, Case School of Applied Slide Rules, by the score of 44-41. All 
other opponents for the rest of the year were not so hospitable, and
Tartan Mermen Submerged By 
Greasy Stone and Nittany Lion
Spangler and Venzer Elected Co-Captains For Remainder of Season; 
Dave Luckey Breaks Record in 200-Yard Breast Stroke; Time 2:35
so our poor boys were trampled 
with defeat. But, strange as it 
may seem, last Wednesday was 
not only Bingsday but Techday. 
Joy reigned in Skiboland as the 
Plaid broke all existing modern 
records by amassing the amazing 
string of one consecutive game. 
Case again receives our nod of ap
preciation.
PLAYERS - OF - THE-WEEK: 
Two cagers who have done yeo
man work all season and who are 
responsible for our first victory 
are my nomination for this week. 
On one hand we have Tasso Katselas from East Pittsburgh  a 
scoring threat from any part of 
the court. Tasso was high scorer 
of the 44-45 season, and is well 
on his way to duplicate that feat. 
On the other hand is George 
Meyer, one of the best defensive 
men to ever don the plaid. His 
work under the bankboards is 
superb, and he deserves far more 
credit than this corner could ever 
give him.
PERSONAL OBSERVATIONS: 
Last Thursday Stan Kohn, var
sity eager, lost a new pair of 
leather top basketball shoes in 
the gymnasium. Stan has offered 
a reward to the finder or any in
formation leading to the recovery 
of the same . . . Beauty and 
brawn seem to go hand in hand. 
Four candidates for the King of 
Hearts crown participated in in
tercollegiate sports. PiKAs Theo 
Bean, Tau Delts Stan Smith, and 
Kappa Sigs C. B. Groomes were 
members of the football squad, 
while Phi Kaps George de 
Morais was a soccer standout . . . 
Speaking of King of Hearts, the 
Ladies Home Companion, G. B. 
Richardson, challenges all women, 
especially those of the female 
gender, to a two-handed game of

Classes Planned 
In Life Saving
Miss Kanrich, head of the 
Womens Physical Education de
partment, has announced that 
there will be classes offered dur
ing the spring semester in the 
Red Cross Instructors Life Saving 
course and in the Senior Life Sav
ing course.
The Instructors course will be 
under the joint direction of the 
mens and womens physical ed
ucation departments and will be 
co-educational. Candidates must 
have earned a Senior Life Saving 
award to be eligible for this 
class.
The classes will be held once 
or twice a week. They may be 
scheduled for three units as a 
regular course, or the hours may 
be credited under the Womens 
Athletic Association program.
Coach A1 Risedorphs Carnegie 
tanksters swallowed the bitter pill 
of defeat twice last week, losing 
by almost identical scores to Slip
pery Rock Teachers, at Slippery* 
Rock, 46-29, on Wednesday, and 
to Penn States trained mermen, 
47-28, in the gym pool on Satur
day. In both meets, the Plaidclad swimmers put up a valiant 
but vain battle.
Though the final score fails to 
indicate it, in the Slippery Rock 
pool the Tartans won four first 
places out of nine events. Against 
State they took but two top hon
ors.
Outstanding against Slippery 
Rock was Dave Duckey who 
broke the previous breast stroke 
record of 2:40 by churning 
through the water in 2:35 minutes 
flat.
Spinx Spangler and Herb Ven
zer, Skibo free style aces, were 
elected to captain the team for 
the rest of the season.

Latest News About Sewage 
Received By Tartan Editor
The editor of a newspaper is a Skibo-prices lobbyists. Speaking 
very important person ... At of Skibo, the other day a letter 
least, that is the impression recame in from a G.I. in New
ceived from the quantity and con
glomeration of little gems stuffing 
her mailbag.
Every week the sewage disposal 
authorities send out an analysis 
of their findings in tapping assort
ed Pittsburgh sewers. Anyone in
terested in underground activi
ties should contact the Tartan edi
tor who has now become quite an 
authority on the subject.
Another weekly contribution to 
the editors wastebasket is a post
card from St. Ezekials Apostolic 
Commission. It contains Bible 
references and warnings from the 
Voice of Doom which offer the 
editor eternal salvation (for a 
price).
The Red Cross supplies its 
weekly tear jerker in a large and 
impressive looking envelope 
marked disaster. The W.C.T.U. 
mails its clip sheets to what it sup
poses are the proper channels, and 
Boo throws these cheerful epis
tles on Sir Barleycorn in the face 
of some unfortunate cub renorter.
The editor receives petitions for 
everything from portal-to-porta'.- 
pay-seeking baby-sitters to lowerGuinea advising the students to 
quit griping about the crowded 
condition in the lunch-room be
cause he was quite sure there was 
plenty of room.
A frequent contributor to the 
mailbox is an aspiring football 
coach who sends in long lists of 
his abilities and accomplishments 
under a different signature each 
time. It didnt take the staff very 
long to recognize his typewriting.
Occasionally little notes float 
in commenting on the Tartan. 
Most of them are rather uncom
plimentary, but once in awhile 
the editor receives congratulations 
for a particularly inspired article 
appearing in the paper. These 
commendations are always anony
mous and are seriously suspected 
to have been written by the author 
of the article praised.
If anyone has a pet peeve he 
would like to get off his shoulder 
just write a letter to the editor 
and tell her all about it. If the 
gripe is good enough she will file 
the letter in her amazing scrap
book for future reference. _

of the most spectacular ever seen

promises to be just as spirited. 
Several posters to announce this 
event are already decorating bul

beat everyone to the punch with 
their stunt at the Perm State bas

Weird stunts are to be expected 
so dont be surprised if a German

nowhere is it better illustrated than in the careers of the men 
who now serve as presidents of Bell Telephone Companies.
As a group, they have put in 611 years of telephone service, an 
average of 36 years each.

Dr. Zetler Teaches 
Engineers Course
Technical Writing, C-144 (sec
ond semester) is one of the new
er courses offered for the benefit 
of students attending evening 
school at Carnegie Tech. The 
course carries 6 units each semes
ter which is equivalent to 2 cred
its. The class meets on Mondays 
and Fridays from 8:30 to 10:00 in 
Room 235B, Industries hall. Pro
fessor Robert L. Zetler, who 
teaches regularly at Pennsylvania 
College for Women, is the instruc
tor for this class at Techs even
ing school.
Technical Writing deals with the 
more practical applications of the 
theoretical forms of English com
position to the actual construc
tion of technical and scientific 
reports. As the graduate engineer 
takes his place in his field, he will 
find numerous occasions to utilize 
knowledge gained through his 
study of Technical Writing. Re
search reports, scientific papers 
and articles must be written at 
one time or another in the career 
of an engineer; ability to compose 
and construct these technical pa
pers is advantageous for all in 
the field.

Well, folks, we have Clems 
Uncle Jake with us tonight, so we 
may as well have him write the 
column for us . . . From my vast 
fund of knowledge I can state 
that, a man is never so weak as 
when a woman is telling him how 
strong he is . . . This is Jake, 
speakingThe mysterious phone 
calls that kept interrupting the 
English class tonight did give re
sults. The message came from a 
girl desperately trying to contact 
a fellow, saying meet me at the 
church. I wonder if she has been 
waiting very long . . . This com
ing Friday is going to be a great 
day of reckoning for the majority 
of the evening students, namely, 
me!!! As you all know, the finals 
will be underway but there is one 
consolation to look forward to . . . 
Those few days of vacation be
tween semesters will be very in
viting . . . By the way, no EightBall for the next two weeks! In 
fact, no paper, Period. . . . One 
of our intellectual socialists hap
pens to be producing musical 
tones by means of the voice and 
Kilroy here asked him what he 
drank. Our associate said he didnt 
drink, Kilroy said what? 
Water, said the associate. My! 
My! . . . Knowledge as well as 
gold is where you find it and 
Rosemary was sitting on plenty of 
it to enable her to foe comfortable

coming Washingtons Birthday

was: permanent minutes of the

Eve. S. C. Minutes
Room A, Carnegie Union 
Sunday, January 12, 1947 
The meeting was called to order 
at 3:00 p.m. by President Mihelich.
Present: Misses Ashcraft, Baum
gardner, Ehni, Hensler, McMurray, Shack, and Zellner, Messrs. 
Adams, Biscup, Bogovich, Mar
tello, Mihelich, McDonald, Vranic.
Absent: Misses De Maria and 
McGraw.
The minutes of the meeting of 
December 8, 1946 were read and 
approved.
Old Business 
Miss Shack presented a budget 
report on the Insignia Banquet 
held at the Penn-Lincoln hotel on 
January 4:
Total Income ............$ 0.00
Total Expenditures .. 185.55
Total Deficit ..........$185.55
Miss Shack reported that Thistle 
hall could not be obtained for the 
purpose of holding a dance in 
January. Consequently, there will 
be no social functions until the 
next dance which will be held on 
February 22, as previously plan
ned.
New Business
Miss Shack informed the Coun
cil that Tommy Carlyn had been 
contacted and that arrangements 
are under way to book his or
chestra for the George Washing
ton Dance. She also brought to 
the attention of the Council the 
problem of securing workers for 
the various jobs to be done dur
ing the evening of the dance, such 
as collecting tickets and taking
care of me check room. It was 
decided to use the Plaid to urge 
students to come out for these 
jobs and thus earn points to
wards their insignia keys and 
subsequent eligibility for repre
sentation on Council. Mr. Biscup 
will obtain an estimate on the 
price of dance folders, and it will 
be decided later if they should be 
secured.
Miss Betty Hensler was intro
duced to the Council. Miss Ash
craft moved that Miss Hensler be 
accepted as a representative of the 
College of Fine Arts, seconded by 
Miss Zellner and approved by the 
Council.
Mr. Mihelich asked the Council 
members if they thought it ad
visable to change the hour of the 
monthly meetings as the members 
were frequently late in arriving. 
Mr, Martello moved that the time 
for the meetings be standardized 
at 2:30 p.m. on the first Sunday 
after the first Monday of each 
month, seconded by Miss Ehni and 
approved by the Council. Mr. 
Mihelich asked that all members 
make a special effort to be prompt 
hereafter.
Mr. Biscup suggested that the 
committees be organized for the 
Engineers Banquet and that the 
work on the letters of solicitation 
for souvenirs be begun.
Miss Zellner reported that com
mittees had been formed for the 
organization and function of the 
Womens Evening School Organ
ization. A further report will be 
given after the next meeting of 
this group. '
Dance scheduled for Saturday 
night, February 22, from 9:00 till 
12:00. The tariff will be $1.00 
per person.
Tis rumored that our coming 
genial maestro is to play this sum
mer at Frank Daleys Meadowbrook, Cedar Grove, New Jersey, 
where all the top flight bands in 
the country appear. For those in
terested, Tommy is appearing at 
the present time at Bill Greens 
night spot on Route 51. From per
sonal experience, we can state 
that at popular dances held 
throughout the district, his or
chestra draws capacity crowds. 
On Sunday evenings, it is almost 
impossible for one to maneuver 
around the floor because of the 
crowd. Turning now to his voca
list, lovely Gail Evans, well! all 
we can say is that she surely can 
sing and what a gal. In addition, 
the Carlyn Trio which features 
Gail Evans and two of his sax 
players does quite a creditable job 
with many of the vocals.
As at the last dance, the Black 
Cat, our refreshment bar, is go
ing to foe manned by at last three 
dependable men, and we guaran
tee to satisfy your thirst by hav
ing plenty of soft drinks on hand 
as well as potato chips to keep 
your jaws in working order. More 
tables and chairs to lend a cafe 
appearance will be placed around 
Thistle hall so that all of us can 
find a place to relax after we 
have finished dancing.
, Tickets will be available this 
week from any member of the 
PLAID staff, Student Council or 
in Mr. McKelways office.
How about all of you planning 
to attend for we feel quite sure 
that you all will have a very en
joyable evenin, as they say in 
Memphis!

Theresa "Marie McLaughlin, of 
Greensburg, Pa., will receive a 
B. S. in electrical engineering, the 
first woman ever to achieve 
that goal at Carnegie Tech.
Robert E. Doherty will preside 
at the exercises and Rev. Vance 
Yarrelle, assistant minister of the 
Shadyside Presbyterian Church 
will offer the invocation. The plat
form group will consist of the 
trustees and the executive board 
of C.I.T., Mr. H. N. Eavenson, 
main speaker and trustee of the 
school, President Doherty, and the 
department heads of the College 
of Engineering and Science.
The department of music chorus, 
under the directorship of Dr. Fred
erick Dorian, will sing Requiem 
and Rondeau, both by Karol 
Rathaus. Later in the program 
they will present Gypsy Life by
Passing Parade
[Continued from page 2] 
of a five-year hunt. Two groups 
of assembly workers were segre
gated and their production records 
examined as their working condi
tions varied. They were put on 
piecework, given rest pauses, 
given hot lunches and short hours. 
Of course their record improved. 
Then suddenly all privileges 
were taken awaybut lo! their 
productivity went up, still.
The research men concluded 
that the only possible explanation 
was the improved attitude of the 
workersthe new feeling of selfrespect that comes from knowing 
the importance of your work, from 
being treated as a valuable co
worker, as these employees had 
been treated. Conclusion: If
people are made to feel import
ant they work well. Feelings not 
only count more than hours of 
labor, but even more than higher 
wages. Recognition of this fact 
might prevent many strikes.
Bill Jacks associates got Turk
ish baths, personalized drinking 
cups and orthopedic shoes to make 
them feel essential. An associate 
regards himself as important 
around the place. Consequently 
he is with the company, not 
against it. When management 
wakes up to this fact we can have 
industrial peace, not before! Man
agement must understand that a 
factory has two functionsthe 
economic function of production 
and the social function of dis
tributing satisfaction among its 
own people.
Robert Schumann. Charles A. H. 
Pearson, head of the department 
of music, will serve as organist 
during the graduation exercises.
The presentation and retiring of 
the colors will be performed by 
members of the R.O.T.C. unit. 
Professor H. K. KirkPatrick, who
is completing arrangements for 
the commencement, stated that the 
music department chorus and the 
R.O.T.C. color guard should be
complimented for their coopera
tion in connection with com
mencement and other campus ac
tivities.
