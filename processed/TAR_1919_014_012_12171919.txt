The Three of Us Proves Fitting 
Climax to Little Theatre Season
Lait Big Play of Quarter
Draws Record Audiences.
Alma Lotz Stars.
On Thursday .evening, an enthusi
astic audience witnessed the first full 
evening performance given this year 
by the Drama DepartmentRachel 
Crothers four-a'ct-play,The Three of 
Us.
Ths melodrania of the mining camp 
was all that could be wished of the 
conventional situation of the uncon
ventional woman who goes to the 
apartment of the yjllian, who is dis
covered by the hero, has a heart-rend
ing quarrel ,and an ultimate reconcili
ation. We wonder if the class of 
plays hereafter is to ,fayor the 30-cent 
audience after such a long period of 
catering to the intellectual high
brows?
The complicated plot in brief .is 
this: Stephen Townley discovered
gold on his claim-and accidently found 
that the same vein ran thru the claim 
of Mrs. Bix. His discovery makes it 
possible to propose to Rhy MacChesney, who to make.axlrama of the situ
ation, delays her acceptance until that 
evening when the party to be given 
by Mrs. Bix, is over. Rhy has a way
ward brother, Clem, who wishes to 
get away from this God-forsaken 
hole that he may try his fortune in 
the big city. As the support of the 
family consists of the income from 
$4,000 and she believes that their for
tune lies in the three of them stick
ing together, she refuses to give him 
the desired funds. Clem accidently 
overhears of the increased value of 
Mrs. Bixs mine and sells the infor
mation to Louis Berresford. A Mr. 
Trenholm has been degotiating with 
Mrs. Bix for the purchase of the mine, 
but throws up the whole deal, when 
it is found that some one else has 
bought the mine. Townley is accused 
of buying it up for his ..own personal 
gains. Guilt for giving the informa
tion falls on Rhy. She cannot deny 
it on account of a promise to A^uo'>e 
ford. After the party, she goes to 
Berresfords apartments to ask him to 
release him from the promise which 
he refuses to do. Stephan enters, and 
finding them together/ new complica
tion arise when Rhy will not explain 
everything to Steve. When she re
turns home,. Clem is leaving for the 
train.. She' prevents him and offers 
to give him $1,000, if he will return 
the money to Berresford. The situa
tion is cleared and we have the hap
py union of Stephan a^d Rhy.
Arleigh Williamson as the hero, is 
the true matinee idol in voice and api pearance! He is appealing in his per
suasion with Rhy and dramatic in 
| his wrath with Berresford. But could 
lie not kiss the heroine more as if he 
were used to it?
Rhy, as portrayed by Alma Lotz,
was a beautiful conception. Her voice 
was sympathetically attuned to the 
atmosphere of the play, her move
ments were graceful. We felt that 
she-was ;genuine. in her tears. In the 
highest "sense, she appealed for her 
honor and the honor of her sex. This 
is Miss Lotz-s .first Jbigpart and she 
discloses striking ability.
James :Church .as Louis Berresford 
played his part, smooth and cunning, 
as the. true gentleman crook. It is 
a comfortable change to see Jimmie 
again in some other role than an old 
maneven tho a villian.
Carl .Reid . was .Clem. >A1 tho he never 
changes his voice, thru his pantomime 
his characterization was true and con
vincing.
Howard Claney, as Tweed Bix, is a 
comfortable husband ruled by his 
wife..' .His malce-up was a master
piece. And Lorimer Trenholm, played 
by Alexander Buchanan, did his bit 
in a strong manner.
Nicholas Mulled was -Sonnie, an 
overgrown Penrod. Imagine a 12- 
year-old, five feet five, talking baby 
talk!
Owen White as Hop Wing, the 
Chinese servant who lazily brushed 
his masters coat gave an interesting 
characterization. Please think of 
Ichabod Crane brushing the Headless 
Horseman!
Mrs. Bix played by Elizabeth Smith, 
made a beautiful picture both in eve
ning dress and riding costume. Miss 
Smith can dance and play and act. 
All we need now is a singing part to 
prove her perfect.
Maggie, the help, played by Alicia 
Guthrie, scored a marked triumph in 
a small but effective role. While not 
overdone, the character stood out as 
one of the best pieces of acting in the 
play. Miss Guthrie has always han
dled character work well, but it is 
seldom that an actress can, by a mere 
woise in the kitchen off stage, without 
even appearing, cause a flutter, a 
whisper of Its Maggie, and a giggle 
of appreciation in the audience.
We could not complain. of lack of 
variety of scenes. I-IoweVer, we al
most thought that the Scenes were 
built between acts. On first nights, 
will it always take an hour between 
acts? First -we are in the miners 
homely dwelling. Next* a living room 
that might well be in Greenwich Vil
lage. Then, the oak-panelled apart
ment of a millionaire. We wish that 
the stove of the first and fourth acts 
looked more like a heating apparatus 
and not so much like some innovation 
of the' coal-saving commission.
With the play as a whole, weare' 
well pleased. \Ve thank Mr. Wallace 
for the melodramaquite an innova
tion !

PLACE WREATH ON
CARNEGIES GRAVE
Freshman Class of Carnegie Visited 
Sleepy Hollow.
YALE ASKS FOR GAME 
WITH PLAID GRIOOERS
The Freshman class of the^ Division' 
of Science and Engineering of the 
Carnegie Institute of Technology of 
Pittsburgh, Pa., today placed a 
| wreath on the grave of Andrew Car
negie in Sleepy Hollow Cemetery to 
commemorate the late steel magnates 
birthday. Mr. Carnegie founded the 
Institute.
The wreath, was laid on the. final 
resting place  by D. B. Templeton. 
Speaking-for the Freshman class Mr. 
Templeton said:
We do not do this simply as a 
formal act, but as a sincere tribute to 
the memory of him to whom we owe 
 so much. Andrew Carnegie, living, 
did great andnoble works for the 
good of mankind, and although he has 
gone to his reward, the good that he 
has done lives after him. Our insti
tute is one of his greatest monuments. 
We hope that our use of? it will ever 
conform to, the high ideals that in
spired its creation.
To the class of 1923 has fallen the 
honor of first commemorating the 
birthday of the^ founder in this man
ner; while this wreath is being placed 
here, a great assembly in Pittsburgh 
is simultaneously doing honor tothe 
memory-of Mr. Carnegie.
It is our hope that this method of 
expressing our gratitude and appre
ciation for what he founder has done 
for us may becoihe an annual institu
tion, and that as the years.bring forth 
greater fruits from, his, work, so, may 
they also lend to. these annual pil
grimages an ever growing place in 
the hearts of students of; the Carnegie 
Institute of Technology, as a, tradi
tion become sacred: by practice, and 
dedicated to the.' classes' of the fu
ture in loving m^pi.ory' of our foundA telegram was received several 
days ago, from the manager of foot
ball at Yale, by Dr. Marks, Acting 
Supervisor of Athletics at Tech. 
Therein was stated that Yale was very 
desirous of resuming athletic relations 
with us and requested a game on our 
1920 football schedule.
The Plaid team last played Yale at 
New Haven in 1916 and made a very 
creditable showing. At the return of 
athletics to. abnormal basis has promp
ted the resummatj.qn of former rela
tions.
The football schedule is in the pro
cess of formation and will probably 
be a hard one. This game will be 
played at New Haven if scheduled.
----------S-----------ALUMNI REUNION TO BE 
HELO FRIDAY EVENING
On Friday evening, December 19. 
the Alumni Federation will hold a 
Christmas Reunion in the Division of 
the Arts Building, to which graduates, 
former students, tind members of the 
faculty are invited,
At eight oclock, the School of 
Drama will .present a one act play, 
Dust of the Road after which there 
will be a short. concert by the Car 
negie Tech Symphony orchestera. 
This program^ will be followed by an 
informal dance until one oclock with 
music by Parenteaus Orchestra. The 
mail order sale of dance tickets be

sion one dollar per couple. Theater 
tickets are complimentary with mail 
orders..
This; is the first affair of this na
turewhich theFederation has given 
but it will be an unusual event here
after.
!,!Residents of Pittsburgh who register in con
secutive years are entitled to a credit of $4.00 per 
quarter. See catalog statement.
CLUBS GIVE 
THEIR FIRST CONCERT
Although there is lots of work to be 
accomplished before perfection is at
tained in the rendering of the various 
selections by both Mandolin and Glee 
Clubs, another merit of credit was 
added to the long list of good con
certs gave before at the concert given 
at May view last Friday.
Of course there is all reason in the 
world for the fellows of both clubs 
to do their best so as to repay for the 
good meal that the nurses served.
After the concert a dance was held 
and many of the fellows found to 
their delight that nurses are some 
dancers.
The following is a tentative sched
ule of the seasons concerts with bids 
from other sections coming in every
eek.
East Liberty Y. M. C. A., January 
24 and 25; Wilmerding, January 29; 
Latrobe, Greensburg, February 5 and 
6; Youngstown, New Castle, Febru
ary 18 to 21; Mt. Washington Home 
Concert, March 5.
To make things more interesting 
and real the picture of both clubs 
was taken last Sunday and it will 
prove, as it always has, a big draw
ing card and a feature of our adver
tising campaign.
HANIEL LONG SENDS 
INTERESTING LETTER
President Hammerschlag has given 
the Tartan .an opportunity to afford 
the many friends of Haniel Long at 
Tech the pleasure of reading one of 
his recent letters. While written to 
the President, his letter will be both 
interesting and inspirational to all 
who knew him.
La Jolla, Calif., 
December 3, 1919.
Dear President Hamerschlag:
Your letter of the 17th has made 
us very happy. We have a small house 
here by the sea, and I am undertak
ing in good earnest the task of get
ting back into shape. I have ' ac
quired a typewriter, as you see; but 
I do not intend to attain my health 
by exercising it.
What progress have we made with 
the New York trustees? The Tartan 
has revealed a great improvement in 
the editing. As I read the faculty 
bulletins, I couldnt help being im 
pressed by what a many-sided school 
we are; on how many planes we coal
esce with the shapes about us making 
up our world. For instance, Trinks 
new book on Prime Movers and Leeds1 
on Engineering and Drawing; Strongs

STUDENT VOLUNTEER 
E
Gatherings Will Be Held in Des 
Moines, la.Carnegie Will Send 
Ten Delegates.
The Student Volunteer Convention 
which is to take place in Dos Moines, 
Iowa, during the Christmas holidays, 
will comprise the largest gathering of 
students ever assembled for any pur
pose. The speakers will be the strong
est student leaders and the very fore
most missionaries of the world. The 
most compelling messages are deliver
ed at this convention, and much 
knowledge is gained at first hand of 
the conditions and needs of the world 
missionary fields. The meeting is 
called tho nearest equivalent to a 
trip around the world in five days. At 
the last convention, missionaries from 
the heart of Africa came for the sole 
purpose of showing the students the 
great necessity for extending mis
sionary work. The present convention 
has been postponed two years on ac
count of the world war and therefore 
has a special significance.
The University of California will 
have the largest delegation with nine
ty-seven members. The colleges of 
the east also have submitted the 
names of many representatives, the 
greater number beink eighty-five. 
Many colleges have applied for extra 
places, Penn State among the first. 
Such an event comes only once in a 
student generation and is certainly 
well worth attending.
The student volunteer movement is 
one of prime interest to all people 
who look upon the work of foreign 
missions as an important factor in 
the solution, of the problems facing 
the world at this time. It has been 
the motive of the movement to get 
as many students as possible inter
ested in the work because they are 
the ones who in the future will mould 
the affairs of the world. Their suc(Continued on page 2.)
THE K. E. V. OUNCE WAS
ENJOYED BY STUDENTS
Last Wednesday afternoon the K. 
E. V.s, the mystery (?) girls of the 
Division of the Arts, entertained the 
student body of that division at a 
dansant. The affair was pronounced 
one of the most enjoyable of the year, 
and was very well attended. Per
haps you are wondering what K. E, 
V. means. So is the rest of the Arts 
student body. Its a deep, dark secret. 
But just as long as the girls continue 
to show everybody as good a time as 
| they did at last Wedensdays dance 
nobody cares .
Honorary Fraternity Formed to 
Encourage Work on Publications
Good Work on Tartan, Thistle or Puppet 
Necessary for Eligibility to Alpha Alpha Nu
Members From Three Mens Schools.
To encourage co-operation among 
and to promote the student publica
tions at the Carnegie Institute of 
Technology, is the purpose of an 
Honorary Fraternity which has just 
been organized. For some it has been 
felt that no encouragement is offered 
to promote good work on the three 
publications which represent Car
negie. To fulfill this need it was 
deemed wise to form Alpha Nu, the 
new publication honorary fraternity.
The requirements for eligibility are 
in no way specialized to this particu
lar brand of student activities, good 
work on the Tartan, Thistle or Pup
pet and representation in at least one 
or more activities is all that is re
quired.
The hope of the fraternity is to 
unify spirit in the Four Schools by use 
of the pen and if it can bo done thru 
the columns of any of tho afore-menARTS SOPHOMORES STEP 
OUT WITH OLD TIME PEP
It may have been that the Sopho
more class of the Division of the 
Arts can not forget that memorable 
Plebe dance they ran last year, or it 
may have been that they were tired 
of waiting for this years Plebe class 
to wake up and show some signs of 
life. No matter what the reason was, 
they stepped out last Friday evening, 
and just to show it was a regular 
1922 party, they invited the rest; of 
the division (even the Plebos) to join 
them.
The dance was held in tho foyer 
of the Arts building, and proved con
clusively to those present that the 
Arts sophs sure are stoppers. Ollio 
Riohl brought his very host bunch 
of Jazz producers, and every ono there 
is talking about the music. Dancing 
lasted from nine till one, and tho tired 
but happy sophs and their guests were 
united in declaring the affair a suc
cessful close to this term's social 
whirl. Wo have yet to hear any kicks 
on tho punchnuf ced.----------
FOR INSIGNIA 
OFTi
The Students Activities Board pro
poses to award insignia to tho mem
bers of the Tartan Board. This has 
never been done in the past and con
sequently an insignia shall havo to 
bo created for this board.
It'is proposed to hold a competi
tion for tho design of this insignia. 
All students of the Carnegie Institute 
of Technology are eligible to compote. 
The designs will be judged by a jury 
from the faculty of the Division of the 
Arts, and the author of the design 
placed first by this jury will be award
ed a prize of $5.00 by the Student Ac
tivities Board. This jury will also 
recommend that the winning design 
be adopted as the official insignia of 
the Tartan Board.
At the present time insignia are 
awarded to members of the Student 
Activities Board, the Musical Clubs, 
the Band and the Thistle Board. The 
general character of all these insignia 
is the samein that they are medals 
of about % of an inch in diameter 
with a large C following the edge 
of the medal. The lettering on this 
C and the design in the center of 
the medal is different for each of the 
activities. It is preferable that this 
general scheme is adhered to. It is 
recommended that competitors ex
amine these medals which are worn 
by a number of students. These med
als are made of bronze, silver, gold 
and gold with a jewel, according to 
the importance of the service render
ed by the recipient. It must be pos
sible to execute the medal in any of 
the materials mentioned.
Designs must be made on a sheet 
of cardboard8%xll inches.
The drawing of the design shall 
not exceed 1% inches in diameter, 
and may be rendered in any desired 
medium. It should be kept in mind 
that the design will be reduced to % 
inch diameter.
The name and identification of the 
author shall be legibly written on 
the back of the cardboardin a space 
not to exceed two inches square 
so that it may be covered with the 
regulation sticker in use in the Di 
vision of the Arts.
All designs shall be in the hands of

Plan Endorsed by Leading
College Authorities.
The Tartan heartily endorses the 
plan proposed in the following tele
gram received from a committee con

John M. Harlan, Chairman, Daily 
Princetonian; Briton Hadden, Chair
man Yah* Daily News; and Fiflold 
Workum, President, Harvard Crim
son. Tho proposition has boon ap
proved by the President and will bo 
given as much publicity as possible, 
and details will be published in the 
next issue. In tho meantime, a copy 
f the communication will speak for 
itself:
JVo the undesigned have undertak
en to promote a referendum of college 
sentiment of the country concerning 
the peace treaty. It is realized that 
many colleges have hold straw ballots 
on this subject, but tho statements of 
the question have in most instances 
lifforod and ailordod no opportunity 
to obtain an accurate and comparative 
expression of the inter-collegiate point 
of view. The plan is that on January 
13 every college and university in tho 
country will ho asked to take a vote 
of its faculty on the ono hand and its 
student body on the other in which 
each member of tho college commun
ity will be asked to declare himself 
Yes or no on: Proposition (1)
I favor tho ratification of the League 
and Treaty without amendments or 
reservations. Proposition (2) I am 
opposed to the ratification of the 
League and the Treaty in any form. 
Proposition (3) I am in favor of the 
ratification of the Treaty and the 
League but only with the specific res
ervations as voted by the majority of 
the Senate. Proposition (5) I favor 
any compromise on the reservations 
which will make possible immediate 
ratification of the Treaty and the 
League.
The committee will forward detail
ed suggestions as to how the vote 
should be carried on. It is urged that 
between now and January 13 the ut
most discussion of the situation should 
be stimulated in your institution. If 
possible public debate and mass meet

COMPETITIVE 
INTEREST TOCOACHS PLAN
Much interest is being added to the 
gymnawium work and the work of Mr. 
Hazel's voluntary plan by the forma
tion of competitive groups who com
pete an a group in several events in 
tho gym. Each group chose their 
ov/n name and the old saying, Whats 
in a name is well shown here. To 
date the following groups have been 
organized:
THE PITT BREAK.
When the attention of Dr. Marks, Acting Supervisor of Athletics at 
Carnegie Tech, was called to the statement that the University of Pittsburgh 
had discontinued athletic relations with Carnegie Tech, Dr. Marks said that 
there has been no recent conference with the athletic authorities of the 
University of Pittsburgh.
It is rather unusual for institutions that have had such long and friendly 
athletic relations to change their policy without previous conference, but up 
to the present time we have had no intimation of a change in policy by our 
neighbor. The vacancies that have been made on our schedule by the with
drawal of Pitt will be filled by other teams. It is not planned to re-open the 
question with the University of Pittsburgh. We are at present engaged in 
working out a more comprehensive plan for physical education and for ath
letics than we have ever had before. We have under consideration the ap
pointment of a professor of physical education and a graduate manager. 
We are not, at the present time, in a position to make a definite announce
ment on these matters. The athletics at our institution have always been on 
a sound basis, and we shall continue to pursue a policy that will give us the 
best teams that are possible, in view of the rather difficult standards of 
scholarship that are maintained hero. II; is recognized that all colleges that 
lire doing technical workwork in dilleront departments of engineering 
are at a great disadvantage in intercollegiate athletics. Tho laboratory work 
and the shop work of the students makes it impossible for them to gfct upon 
tho athletic field until late in the afternoon; freqently not before half past 
live. In spito of this handicap, tho teams that have represented Carnegie 
Tech, have shown sportsmanship of a high order. Tho football team this 
year made a remarkable showing against Pitt, and while we did not expect 
to win, everyone who saw the. game was impressed by the toam-play of our 
men, and the thorough training that they had received. The whole subject 
of athletics Is receiving very careful consideration by tho C. 1. T. authorities, 
and when tho plans are ready we shall have some further comments to make.

TREATY RATIFICATION
(Continued from page 1.) 
its method of statement. Both Sena
tors have been invited to make a direct 
statement to the colleges and univer
sities of the country, summarizing 
their respective points of view. You 
will be fully advised as to their reply. 
It is planned that the vote shall bo 
conducted under such safeguards as 
may be established in each institu
tion to secure secrecy and complete
ness and that the results shall be made 
known locally at once and telegraphed 
to the headquarters of the committee 
where the result for the whole coun
try and for the individual colleges 
will be compiled and made public. You 
will appreciate the value of the vote 
in each academic community if it is 
as nearly complete as possible and al
so the importance of having each col
lege in the country represented on 
the complete compilation of the re
sult. No propaganda whatever will be 
circulated by the committee and no 
point of view advocated. The undersigned themselves hold different views 
concerning the issue presented. The 
plan is solely to stimulate discussion 
in the academic communities and to 
obtain as accurate as possible expres
sion of college sentiment. The feel
ing is that the educational results of 
this effort will be very great and that 
the indication of sentiment thus ob
tained will be enlightening to every
body concerned, Tho undersigned 
will do nothing more in t he whole mat
ter than issue suggestions as to how 
the vote shall be carried on, compile 
the returns as reported by each col
lege and give pulicity to the rosult 
as declared. No further use will be 
made of the results of the vote. May 
we ask you to undertake responsibil
ity for putting this plan into etVect 
in your own institution. Full details 
follow by mail. Will you kindly bring 
this telegram to the attention of the 
President of your institution with the 
statement that in sending it out we 
have the approval of an advisory com
mittee of which President Hadley of 
Yale is chairman and on which Presi
dents Butler of Columbia, Lowell of 
Harvard and Hibben of Princeton are 
also serving.

Each group is composed of from 
six to nine members chosen by a 
leader of each section. These groups 
compete in dipping, chinning, dive and 
roll, basketball, hustle ball, high 
jump and other floor work. The score 
of each group is made by adding the 
total of the whole group and dividing 
by the number of men in the group. 
An unusual interest has been shown 
since the groups have been started 
and some very keen competition has 
resulted. To date in the dipping the 
highest percentage is held by the 
Skidders with a per cent of 7.7 per 
man. The Ivories are second with 
a per cent of 7 per man. The Geeks 
and Krazy Katz are tied for third 
honors with a per cent of 6.5 while the 
Gang and Pugnacii are tied at a per 
cent of 6. The Rough Necks have 
the low score in dipping with only 
an average of 3 per man. Get busy 
Rough Necks. The Skidders hold 
the individual record of 15 dips. This 
is also the best that has been done 
this yean The Ivories are second in 
individual honors with 14 dips. The 
Rough Necks arc third with 12 and 
the Yeggs fourth with 11. The Pug
nacii also have a record of 12 in the 
dips. The individual record in the 
dive and roll is held by the Pugnacii 
with a dive of 10 feet. In the high 
jump the Jazz Babies have succeeded 
in getting all their men over the 
height of 4 foot 2 inches.
On account of the competitive in
terest involved a great number of 
men arc voluntarily using tho gymna
sium to increase the score of their 
clubs.
The greatest handicap in all the 
work is lack of space.
D
STUDENT VOLUNTEER
CONVENTION IMPORTANT 
(Continued from page 1.) 
successful inasmuch as six or seven 
thousand students and professors 
from practically every college and 
univerity in this country and Canada 
will attend the convention at Dos 
Moines. This merely shows that the 
colleges are endeavoring to devolop 
the religious as well as the scholastic 
sides of their student lives.
Before the war these meetings wore 
held every four years and much inter 
est was shown as is proved by the 
large number who attended and the 
interesting clippings taken from news
papers and letters sent by former 
representatives. This will be the first 
convention which has been held for 
four years and promises to be in a 
class by itself in regard to importance 
arid attendance. The main purpose 
of this meeting is to bring the stu
dents together in order that they may 
face and study the situation which 
confronts the world today and also 
to consider the responsibility which 
rests upon the American college men 
and women in regard to the serious 
problems which must be solved. Not 
only will there be about seven thou
sand representatives from the colleges 
of North America present but also 
five hundred foreign students from 
forty different nations.
The list of speakers will include 
the foremost Christian leaders and 
statesmen from all parts of the world 
and that in itself will be a big in
ducement, while the realization that 
each person is representing his col 
lege and doing something for it will 
make the trip of interest to all.
The Editor of the Tartan was quite 
right last week in regard to the at
titude of the Student Convntion Com
mittee on publicity. We were not 
anxious for publicity for the reason 
that from the outset we were up 
against odds that: seemed to spell in
evitable failure, and no one likes to 
advertise failure. In the first place, 
we had only a week in which to work, 
for the registration fees had to be in 
New York on December 1. At that 
time we had only three possibilities 
in sight, but sent in registration fees 
for six. Later, after sufficient time 
had elapsed for the various friends 
of Tech to reflect upon the matter, 
they saw the desirability of sending 
as large a representation as possible, 
and raised sufficient money for twelve 
delegates from the mens schools a
reported last week. This information 
was telegraphed to New York imme
diately but too late to secure reserva
tions.
For the greater part, the delegates 
were chosen by the various churches 
who raised the necessary traveling 
expenses. The delegates who will 
represent Tech at the Convention 
are:
Margaret Morrison Division: Fac
ulty, Miss Lenorah Honecker. Stu
dents: Miss -Mary Bechtel, Eleanor 
Cox, Eleanor McCarson, Gladys Ram
sey, Lillian Coleman. Men's Divi
sion: Faculty, G. T. Miller. Stu
dents: L. E. Emerich, R. D. Foxon, 
Kenneth McAlpine, Marshall Muir, J.
B. de M. Carvalho.
Mr. Carvalho was selected as a 
representative Latin-American stu
dent by an interested organization in 
New York City.
The Committee wishes to take this 
opportunity to thank the many 
friends who responded so generously 
and made this representation possible.
FRATERNITY-DORMITORY 
FLOOR LEAGUES FORMED

PROFESSOR FOLLOWS 
ACQUIRES NEW SHOES
The Tech students are ever ready 
to help out a poor prof in distress. 
This is shown by the recent deed of 
the Sanior Mechanicals and Electric
als in helping Professor Follows to 
keep in step with H. C. L.
One day the faculty had a meeting 
to discuss the salaries they were re
ceiving, and King George was one of 
the most enthusiastic members of the
S. P. B. S. (Society for the Promo
tion of Bigger Salaries). In fact he 
went so far as to make a speech on 
the subject, altho it is not told how 
many went to sleep during the out
burst of oratory, it is known that 
some one was awake when he men
tioned the fact that he did not have 
money enough to buy himself a new 
pair of shoes. He claims he had 
bought his wife a new pair of shoes 
which cost thirty dollars and so had 
to go without shoes himself. This is 
indeed a terrible state of affairs.
Of course when the students heard 
about this sad condition they imme
diately decided that action must be 
taken. They could picture the poor 
prof wandering across the cut on a 
lice winter day in his bare feet and 
Lhis did not seem to be an ideal con
dition. A barefooted professor would 
ive a bad name to the school so 
hey raised a fund.
On Wednesday morning when Prof. 
Follows went into the class-room he 
had a sad look on his face; he had 
been contemplating on the high cost 
of living. Suddenly his face lit up in 
a bright smile of joy and gratitude, 
for there on his desk reposed one 
nair of shoes which shone with a 
Vautiful black lustre. After the first 
wave of surprise had passed over, 
the recipient of the shoes delivered 
%& eloquent address, accepting the 
ift. He said he was terribly grate'ul and that if they did not fit he 
would make them do so. He even 
went so far as to say he would alter 
his feet if necessary. In closing may 
we quote from the personal interview 
reported in the Post:
I shall always cherish these 
shoes, he said, feelingly, even if I 
iever wear them. And the next time 
I talk too much I shall talk about a 
suit of clothes.
Maybe theyll take you up on the 
clothes, too, professor, some one 
suggested last night, and the profes-.or said: Maybe.
What kind of shoes are they? he 
was asked.
Nice shoes, he said.
Yes, but what kind?
"Black.
But what other distinctive fea'ures do they have?
Theyre soledand they have 
heels, too.
And what else?
Lacestheyre completely fitted 
up with laces. Yes, completely.

TAU BETA PHI HOLDS 
FIRST INITIATION

After a very impressive initiation 
ceremony, wherein was set forth the 
ideals of the society a sumptous ban
quet was served. Not only was the 
Tech Active Chapter and Alumni 
present at the ceremonies, but all the 
Tau Beta Pi men and alumni from 
other schools, employed in this dis
trict. A. M. Dudley, of Michigan 
Alpha, delivered the address of the 
evening. His theme was Engineer
ing Ideals. Dean Mott acted as 
toastmaster for the evening and Prof. 
Trinks presented the prizes.
The music was furnished by the 
initiates and also by Maggios Or
chestra. One of the features of the 
evening was a take-off on the 
pirate scene from Bohemia Unlimit
ed, by five of the new members.

INTERESTING LETTER 
(Continued from page 1.) 
cess along that line has been very 
addresses on the Learning Curve and 
other mysterious matters; Bossange 
at the Metropolitan on French Art 
under the Monarchy and modern Am
erica; Day at Wheeling on the Bible, 
Dante, Cervantes, etc.; the dramtic 
performances for high-school stu
dents and business and professional 
groups; your presidency of the meet
ing of the state college presidents; 
Binghams going to Washington for 
half-time service with the National 
Research Council; the Bureau of Per
sonnel Research in conference with 
the Carnegie Steel, Equitable Life, II. 
J. Heinz and other business compan
ies. Thus the threads of our loom 
go in and out of the texture of our 
days.
I noted further Peters visits to the 
secondary schools in and about the 
city; McCorklos visits to alumni at 
Buffalo, New York and Philadelphia, 
and his talking with them' about our 
program of development; his con
tacting with employers for the plac
ing of our graduates, and with officers 
of college appointment bureaus for 
new teachers; a movement for faculty 
housing, and something which I didnt 
understand about faculty insurance; 
above all, the registration of 4,43G 
students, 593 entering Science and 214 
Designall measures of integration 
for ourselves and the times; of making 
strong the sources of our life, through 
the contagion of an esprit do corps, 
and the acquisition of a prestige. Our 
health as a living body must be su
perb, for we have work to do!
1 confess to smiling when I read 
that Thayer had started a dancing 
class, and that Miss Breed had gone 
to the Marlborough-Blenheim for a 
rest.
Would it be possible to obtain a 
copy of Mr. Schwabs remarks on 
Founders Day?
I am sending you some fragments 
written enroute which may interest 
you and Mrs. Hamerschlag. I have 
no news to give you this time, as 
I am quite relaxed. Still, here is a 
quotation from Goethe which struck 
me much as did the verses of Dante 
I sent you last summer:
We should give unity to out
lives by devoting them with 
hearty enthusiasm to some pur
suit. . .the pursuit assigned to us 
by Nature through the capacities 
she has given us.
No doubt you are familiar with the 
passage, and also with Carlyles acute 
remark that Goethe substitutes for 
the idea of pleasure that of the satis
faction of special inborn aptitudes dif
ferent in each individual.
Such quotations from the masters 
are dear to me not because I need to 
be persuaded that we are right in our 
scheme of education, but rather be
cause they constitute traditions for 
us, traditions invisible indeed, yet 
more powerful to the imagination than 
those connected with or rising from 
visible objects. That Christ himself 
expressly taught the culture and use 
of ones aptitude for the sake of that 
kingdom whose moving name was ever 
on his lips, is with me solemnly and 
always. Traditions, it seems to me, 
have the power of absorbing us into 
the experience of the varied past; 
lighted by the torches of the centuries, 
they project us into the unkown fu
ture; and besides they fill us to over
flowing with the spirit of many van
ished lives, and we see more, think 
more, live more, because of them.
Thank you very much for your good 
letter, and for sending me the Tartans 
and bulletins. With our kindest wishes 
to you and Mrs. Hamerschlag.
Yours as ever,
HANIEL LONG.

Weekly Advice.
If you would win a Maggie's hand, 
Or play a trombone in the band,
Or be a fleshy steward and 
Have lots of gold at your command, 
Just camouflage.
If you'd be thought exceeding smart, 
And make Tau Beta at the start, 
Don't memorize your stuff by heart, 
Look wise, my boy, and play the part.
Just camouflage.
Or when your pockets need a pad 
And the beanery thinks your credits 
bad;
Its no time to be glum and sad,
Or send a wire to your dad,
Just camouflage.
It doesnt matter what it is,
It comes in every line of biz,
In love or in a mid-year quiz,
It does an awful lotgee whiz.
Just camouflage.* * *

Sweet spirits of aviation, one drop 
and you know the rest.* * *

More Scandal.
From a recent novel: Her breath

B-Wcar.
When you view a maid with eyes dark 
blue,
With cheeks of pink and red lips too; 
With eyebrows dark and fair gold 
hair,
'Tis camouflage, my boy, beware.
For eyebrows come in sticks they say 
And peroxides cheap most any day, 
Cheeks and lips and dark eyes blue 
Depend upon the druggist too; 
Beware, 'tis camouflage to capture 
. you.* * *

Pray let me kiss your hand, said he, 
With looks of burning love;
I can remove my veil, said she,
Much better than my glove.

Now comes the rumor theyre going

course in eight years.

Pitt Severs Sport Tic.
Tech followers were given a distinct 
surprise last week when Pitt officials 
announced the severance of athletic 
relations with the wearers of the 
Plaid.
Many wild rumors were immediate
ly launched to account for this action. 
It is believed however that the breach 
was occasioned by the strained rela
tions which have existed for some 
time past between the two student 
bodies.
The affair on Forbes Field this fall 
resulting in several Pitt adherents be
ing lodged in the Oakland guard
house, was a culmination of several 
other instances of a similar nature.
The chief sufferers of this action 
will be the Pittsburgh public who 
have come to look upon the annual 
Pitt Tech classic as the greatest foot
ball attraction of the season.* * *

SCIENCE PLEBES HOLD
SMOKER IN GYMNASIUM
The Freshmen of the Science school 
held a smoker in the gym Saturday 
evening despite the unfavorable 
weather conditions.
Although many were absent due to 
preparing for examinations this week. 
Nevertheless, a good get-together 
meeting was held.
A jazzy orchestra kept the fellows 
in good humor while they waited in 
line to get their portion of the cider, 
doughnuts and smokes.
The next event on the program was 
a wrestling and boxing match.
After this four members of the 
Glee Club gave a short concert.
A noticeable thing about this smo
ke]1 was that all the entertainers were 
Plebes. And this affair would have 
been one hundred per cent Plebe if a 
few of the fellows hadnt been afraid 
to get their shoes wet.
Up to four years ago the Edison roll-crusher 
drive shown in the blueprint was considerable 
of a trouble maker as regards belts. The 
tremendous burden of starting and turning the 
1 5-ton rolls proved too great for the belts being 
used, their average life being about eighteen 
months. Then a Goodyear Belt was tried. It 
has already given nearly 48 months of service.
They have gained more than 30 months in
service alone. When our Mr. Foster called 
four years ago he found that the belts then in 
use gave trouble. In damp weather they 
tightened so much that they endangered the 
bearings. In hot, dry weather they stretched 
so that frequently they had to be taken up 
several times a week in order to move the rolls 
at all. In addition, the grit and dust of the 
crusher used to chew up the belts and make 
them ragged and inefficient some months 
before they had to be discarded.
After careful study Mr. Foster recommended
a Goodyear Belt of Blue Streak construction 
absolutely waterproof, friction surfaced, un
stitched, supple, and extraordinarily strong. 
The Kelly Island Company agreed to try 
it out.
The Goodyear Belt has never had to be taken 
up in its four years of hard work. The grit, 
dust, exposure and hard work have affected
it so little that it looks good for two more 
years.
After the Goodyear Belt had been working
for some months Mr. Foster called again. He 
pointed out how he had studied the drive 
how he had specified for it a belt to fit the 
need, and had his recommendation checked 
by the Belting Engineering Department at 
Akron to be absolutely sure of proper appli
cation. A 10-ply belt seemed too heavy for 
the power, but it was certainly necessary to 
start the heavy 1 5-ton rolls.
Then he told them about the Goodyear Plan
of Plant Analysisof having a G. T. M. 
Goodyear Technical Manstudy every drive 
in a plant and specify the proper belt for it. 
They had a plant analysis madenot only in 
the Marblehead plant, but in all the plants 
of the companyand have since ordered 
many belts according to specifications of our 
engineers.
The vahzs tf specifying belts by analysis 
.>f the particular duty required of them is 
created in detail in the Goodyear Mechanical 
Goods Encyclopedia. Students and teachers cf 
engineering will be furnished copies cn request 
to the Mechanical Goods Department, The 
G-'oriyear -Tire Rubber Company, Akron, 
Ohio.
