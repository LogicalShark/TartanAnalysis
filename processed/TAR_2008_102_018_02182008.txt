olleges gossip online
HEATHER TOMKO
Junior Staffwriter
^?Hello there, Upper East Siders  or is it upperclassmen? 
|t seems that Gossip Girl has a 
rival in the new Juicy Campus 
{'jvww.juicycampus.com), a
website that dishes out all the 
latest gossip for more than 50 
college campuses across the na
tion.
Juicy Campus was founded at 
Duke University in August 2007 
by Matt Ivester, as an anony
mous way to post light gossip 
for entertainment. The site has 
only increased in popularity 
Since then.
I think on college campuses 
every day across the country,
there are hilarious, entertain
ing, and fun stories being made. 
And Juicy Campus is a great 
place to collect those stories, 
Ivester stated in the Daily lllini, 
the student newspaper for the 
University of Illinois.
However, as the number of 
colleges that Juicy Campus cov
ered grew, so did the type of 
gossip that the site covered. The 
site allows anyone to post on the 
site anonymously, after creat
ing an account; because of this, 
the site includes gossip that is 
sometimes more than just light
hearted and entertaining.
In a perfect world, I imagine 
people would realize that a site

Campus celebrates diversity
DAWN WANG
Junior Staffwriter
February is a month of culture, history, 
and diversity, otherwise known as Black 
History Month, but this year the celebra
tion at Carnegie Mellon extends beyond 
African and African-American cultures. 
This years events include a wide spec
trum, from Renaissance-themed Late 
Nights and gospel concerts; to lectures 
on Islamic history. The events provide 
the opportunity for the Carnegie Mellon 
community to learn from speakers, pro
fessors, and other students.
The planning for'Black History Month 
(BHM) started last November and in
volved the collaboration of different 
groups on campus, many of which are 
student-run.
According to the coordinator of Stu
dent Development and of BHM events,
M. Shernell Smith, there was a goal from 
the beginning of planning to expand con
tribution and participation beyond the 
obvious groups to bring more diversity to 
the events.
Jessica Smith, the programming as
sistant of Multicultural Initiatives in 
Student Development, spoke excitedly 
about student participation and the effort 
to include Carnegie Mellon students of all 
cultures and ancestries.
Participation in BHM events is usu
ally excellent with regard to the campus 
population that has a personal connec
tion to the culture, she said. However, 
the challenge resides in getting people 
of non-African ancestry to participate 
in BHM events. If people hesitate to par
ticipate in events because they are not 
familiar with the culture, thats all the

First-years obtain 
expanded housing
PHYLLIS KIM
Staffwriter
Room Draw has arrived, and anticipation is 
in the air as many still scurry to find rooms and 
roommates for the upcoming school year. While 
first-year students will have more options, up
perclassmen will be experiencing a number of 
new restrictions.
Boss House, Scobell House, and Mudge House 
are all making gradual transitions to becoming 
all first-year areas, as are a number of floors in 
other buildings. Rooms in these buildings will 
either be limited to first-year students or re
stricted for upperclassmen.
Boss will become an all-first-year building 
starting in the fall, so upperclassmen are not al
lowed to retain their rooms.
Scobell will eventually hold all first-years as 
well. However, next year, current thirdand 
fourth-floor residents, and firstand secondfloor residents who possess singles will be able 
to retain their rooms.
Mudge House will also begin its transition to 
all first-years. Only current Mudge House resi
dents will be able to retain their rooms. These 
residents will not be able to pull in others.
Other housing areas that are unavailable 
include Donner House, Hamerschlag House, 
Morewood Gardens E Tower, and New House, 
as well as the first floors of Henderson, McGill, 
and Welch houses.
The changes were made based on the deliber
ation of a task force that was created last spring 
solely focused on first-year housing.
The task force members agreed that the 
benefits which would accrue from the ability to 
intentionally design the staffing, program, and 
facility in these communities around the firstyear experience outweigh the loss of flexibility 
some first-year and upperclass students would 
have in selecting housing options, said John 
Hannon, director of Student Development.

Universities come of age
SABRINA PORTER
News Editor
According to a new study, fe
males are more prevalent than 
ever in the presidential suite at 
colleges and universities across 
the nation. Twenty-three per
cent of todays presidents are 
female, showing a 13.5 percent 
increase from 1986.
The survey was released 
last Wednesday by the Ameri
can Council on Education and 
the College and University 
Professional Association for 
Human Resources. It measured 
trends in college and university 
presidents, as well as senior ad
ministrative positions for the 
year 2007.
The survey found increasing 
trends not only in female rep
resentation, but also in term 
lengths and average ages of 
presidents and administrators. 
The change in female represen
tation in these positions was the 
largest trend observed in the 
study.
Its great that there are more 
women in the field, Carnegie 
Mellon President Jared L. Cohon said. But there are still not 
enough.
Cohon appointed the first fe
male executive vice president 
at Carnegie Mellon, and now 
three of the universitys five vice 
presidents are female. This pro
portion far exceeds the national 
average, as the study found only 
31 percent of vice presidents to 
be women.
There need to be more 
women in the public face of the 
university, Cohon said. This 
will really affect how universi
ties are composed.
Carnegie Mellon is also an 
example to another aspect of 
the survey, that of presidential 
terms. Nationally, the average 
term has increased from 6.3 
years in 1986 to 8.5 years in 
2006.
I have contributed a fair 
share to this average, joked

Illinois gunman kills six
SABRINA PORTER
News Editor
At Northern Illinois Univer
sity last Thursday, Feb. 14, a 
gunman opened fire in a lec
ture hall, killing six students 
including himself and injuring 
16 others, three of whom re
main in critical condition.
According to a Feb. 15 CNN 
article, the gunman was identi
fied as Steven P. Kamierczak, a 
former graduate student in so
ciology at the university.
At 3:06 p.m., Kazmierczak 
opened the door to a geol
ogy lecture in Clarke Hall and 
started shooting. He is believed 
to have fired close to 30 shots at 
the 160 students present. The 
students had been watching a 
PowerPoint presentation when 
Kazmierczak burst in, dressed 
all in black from his pants to 
his hat.
CNN reported that univer
sity police officers entered the 
building just as students were 
fleeing. When they arrived, Ka
zmierczak had already killed 
himself.
The five victims were all stu
dents: three were 20, one was 
19, and one was 32. No con
nection has been discovered 
between Kazmierczak and the
students he killed and injured.
Lieutenant John Race of Car
negie Mellon University Policsaid that a university police 
force can only do so much in 
terms of prevention.
Northern Illinois University 
President John Peters acknowl
edged this fact.
While universities tradition
ally have been some of the most 
open institutions, events like 
this and Virginia Tech and oth
ers are forcing us to reconsidei 
how we do things, Peters said 
in a press release. I think that 
is unfortunate but necessary. 
The University of Northern 
Illinois had revised its safety 
policies after Virginia Tech, 
instituting a campus alert sys
tem, according to the release 
By 3:20 p.m., the alert mes
sages went out via the school 
web site, e-mail, voice mail, the 
campus crisis hotline, the news 
media, and alarm systems. The 
alerts caused chaos on campus, 
CNN reported, leaving many 
wondering how such a tragedy 
could have happened.

University unveils new study abroad in Qatar
Located in Education City in Doha, Carnegie Mellon-Qatar is home to students from all over the Middle East.

Staffwriter
On a snowy February morn
ing, while sitting at th Carnegie 
Mellon Caf sipping a latte, it 
maybe hard to acknowledge that 
in another part of the world, it is 
not snowing at Carnegie Mellon. 
There, temperatures are sky
rocketing and desert sands are 
the norm.
A new Carnegie Mellon study 
abroad program offers students 
the chance to experience this 
other side of the world, at Carn
egie Mellon-Qatar.
Through the Office of Stu
dent Development, students can 
travel to Qatar and work as paid 
course assistants for required
classes in computer science, 
information systems, and busi
ness.
Students will be provided with 
free housing and transportation 
to and from Doha, Qatar. Course 
assistants are paid $12 per hour 
and car allowance is reimburs
able up to $500 a month.
Sophomore business majors 
Hilary Smith and Megan Larcom 
traveled to Qatar last semester, 
before the program was an offi
cial option.
Smith and Larcom worked as 
course assistants in introduc
tory business classes while also 
taking classes to satisfy their 
own business majors.
It was incredibly reward
ing, Smith said. Traveling to
Jordan, the UAE [United Arab 
Emirates], India, and Egypt was 
beyond amazing. We saw Petra 
and the Pyramids and Sphinx  
two of the seven wonders of the 
ancient world  in four months. 
The unique blend of cultures al
ways keeps life interesting. 
When asked what she missed 
the most, Smith quickly re
sponded: Bagels.
Smith and Larcom experi
enced temperatures much hot
ter than they were used to. They 
said it was often hard to go 
outside.

CIT receives presidential honor
On Feb. II, Carnegie Institute* of 
Technology was recognized by Learn 
and Serve America and placed on the 
Presidents Higher Education Community 
Service Honor Roll for exemplary service 
efforts to disadvantaged youth.
The award was given for the Toys for 
Tots program, established at Carnegie 
Mellon by the First-Year Advisory Board 
to the engineering college in December 
2006.
Although created by the board, the 
program has since extended to the entire 
university.
The Presidents Higher Education 
Community Service Honor Roll recog
nizes colleges and universities across 
the nation that support innovative com
munity service programs. It is also the 
highest federal recognition a college or
university can receive to recognize its 
community service and civic engagement 
efforts. Carnegie Mellon was one of 528 
schools to get this honor.
Toys for Tots is a program established 
in 1947 and run by the U.S. Marine Corps 
that delivers toys to children from disad
vantaged families at Christmastime.
Each year, the U.S. Marine Corps picks 
up the toys in a horse-drawn carriage that 
circles the Cut before exiting on Frew 
Street. Members of the board ride on the 
sleigh with the toys they have collected.
The board was started in September 
2006 and consists of 20 first-year stu
dents selected from all engineering ma
jors who work to ensure that the needs of 
first-year engineers are met.
The Board plans to continue Toys for 
Tots this upcoming Christmas.
Professor educates on health
Kristin Hughes, an associate pro
fessor in the School of Design, has 
partnered with the University of 
Pittsburgh Medical Center and local 
public schools to create an interac
tive learning game aimed at instilling 
healthy lifestyles in children.
The program, Fitwits, allows teach
ers and doctors to educate children 
and families with a number of educa
tional games that are embedded with 
content about healthy choices.
These games include three main cat
egories: Games for Health, for schools; 
Doctors Spaces, for doctors waiting 
rooms; and Fitwits Healthperks, for 
local businesses; in which consumers 
are rewarded for healthy choices.
Games for Health include memory, 
matching, and trivia games that teach
students about the concept of food 
portions. Hughes is also working on 
recess and gym games that encourage 
students to exercise.
As part of Doctors Spaces, flash
cards will be instituted in doctors 
waiting rooms that teach kids healthy 
food choices in place of junk food.
For Fitwits Healthperks, Hughes is 
working with local businesses to offer 
discounts and coupon incentives to 
customers who chose to eat healthily.
Fitwits will be available in March, 
when it will be tested in the Pittsburgh 
Public Schools.

THETARTAN.ORG/NEWS THE TARTAN FEBRUARY 18,'2008 A3
Boss House (pictured above), along with Mudge and Scobell houses are all gradually making the transition to all-first-year residences.
New Gossip Girl arrives on the college scene
HEAATRO fromAl
like juicycampus.com unfairly 
j picks its targets and acts ad; versarial to them, said Eli Gwynn, Carnegie Mellon School 
of Computer Science alum and 
i junior software engineer at 
OkCupid.com, an online dat
ing site. Once realizing this, 
theyd see how damaging it 
is to society and dismiss it as 
form of entertainment. In our 
decidedly imperfect world, 
people love their gossip.
Juicy Campus has become 
especially popular among 
Greek communities.
In the sites Frequently 
Asked Questions section, 
Ivester noted some key ideol
ogy behind the website.
Facts can be untrue. Opin
ions can be stupid, or igno
rant, or mean-spirited, but 
they cant be untrue, Ivester 
wrote. And we believe every
one is entitled to their opin
ion.
These opinions are causing 
uproar at colleges and univer
sities across the nation.
At Pepperdine University, 
students were so against 
the site that the concern 
prompted a student govern
ment resolution last month. 
The Government voted 23-5
to ban Juicy Campus from the 
campus network.
However, students continue 
to post daily on the site and 
many advocate the service 
for its principle of anonymous 
gossip.
There are a number of Facebook groups praising Juicy 
Campus for its fun and, as 
some have posted, harmless 
gossip.
However, the description of 
this site as harmless is up 
for debate, as there are just as 
many Facebook groups urg
ing people to stop using the 
website.
The glory of anonymous 
praise is much less potent than 
the shame of anonymous con
demnation, Gwynn noted.
Despite the uproar, an openforum website allowing people 
to post anonymous comments 
is nothing new to scandal.
I dont think its anything 
ground breaking. Its yet 
another Web 2.0 scheme of 
getting your users to provide 
all of your content for you. 
Their gimmick is that you can 
post anonymously, Gwynn 
said. Ultimately, I think its 
success will be limited to its 
own subculture of people who 
thrive on lots of gossip, if it 
takes off at all. Theres only so
far you can get with a system 
that throws accountability out 
the window.
A. similar issue happened 
last year with www.autoadmit.com, a college admissions 
discussion forum.
When a group of law stu
dents started posting offensive 
comments against female 
classmates, the offended par
ties took legal action.
However, as the comments 
were anonymous, the case was 
hard to come by.
Legally, the websites them
selves are protected not only 
by precedent of the First 
Amendment, but also by a sec
tion of the Communications 
Decency Act, which holds that 
the user of an interactive com
puter service cannot be held as 
the speaker of comments that 
are posted by another Internet 
content provider.
The people that post the 
comments are another story.
Yet, anonymity is a protec
tion itself as these speakers 
cannot be directly identified.
Students at Carnegie Mellon 
may not have heard of Juicy 
Campus, as the university does 
not have any gossip postings 
as of yet. However, the nearby 
University of Pittsburgh has 
racked up quite a bit of gossip.
Popular gossip topics at Pitt 
include Sluttiest Boy on Cam
pus and Hottest Frat Boy. 
The site also includes tabs that 
sort the gossip into categories 
such as Sports/Athletes and 
Greek Organizations, as well 
a feature honoring the juici
est posts of the day.
Mary Grace DeForest, se
nior mathematics major and 
president of the Panhellenic 
Council, the governing body 
of sororities at Carnegie Mel
lon, is not a supporter of the 
site; she does not believe that 
Juicy Campus would positively 
affect the Greek community 
here.
There does >not seem to 
be anything positive coming 
from this. My hope is that at 
Carnegie Mellon, we can work 
together to create a more co
hesive and supportive Greek 
community, DeForest said.
With the already competi
tive and driven atmosphere at 
Carnegie Mellon, one can only 
imagine what would happen if 
students began posting gossip 
on Juicy Campus.
It seems as though it is a 
way to gossip in a very nega
tive manner, DeForest said. 
We do not need any more 
venues in which to allow for 
gossip and speculation.

However, Hannon emphasized 
that the changes in housing are 
not meant to isolate first-years.
The goal of these changes is 
not to isolate first-years from upperclass students, Hannon said, 
but rather to allow us to create 
residential communities on the 
main campus that are specifi
cally designed around the needs 
of first-year students.
Kim Ting, a sophomore biol
ogy major and RA in Morewood 
E Tower, agreed with Hannon.
A first-year building provides 
for a good community of people 
who are more willing to leave 
their rooms and make friendships 
with their fellow housemates, 
something that is important for 
the first-year experience, Ting 
said.
Other students, like first-year 
information systems major Ash
ley Castillo, see it differently.
All the first-year buildings are 
understandable, but they make 
campus housing almost impos
sible for upperclassmen. With 
so many houses reserved just for 
first-years, our options are more 
and more limited, she said. And 
the whole housing and room draw 
process is still confusing for me. 
There are rumors flying left and 
right as to whats open and what 
were allowed to retain.
However, Hannon insisted 
that the task force considered the 
issue from every angle.
The impact of these changes 
on upperclass students was heav
ily considered throughout this 
process, Hannon said. Looking 
ahead, as we increase the num
ber of first-year spaces in some 
houses, we will be lowering the 
number of first-year spaces in 
other houses, which ultimately 
means that more upperclass 
students will be living in those 
spaces.
For example, under the cur
rent plan for 2008-2009, there 
will be no first-year students 
living in Resnik, West Wing, 
Morewood Gardens, Roselawn, Woodlawn, or Margaret 
Morrison, which means that 
approximately 120 additional 
upperclass students will be liv
ing in those houses as compared 
to the 2007-2008 year.
Despite these new spots, 
some upperclassmen are wor
ried about being left with 
off-campus housing, most of 
which is more expensive than 
on-campus residences.
By the time we find out if 
were on or off campus, itll be 
too late to try to look for apart
ments or houses that may be 
cheaper, said first-year H&SS 
student Christine Lin.
The impact of these changes 
on upperclass students was 
heavily consideredthroughout this process.
 John Hannon
Lin also brought up the fact 
that the decisions for the RA 
process are not announced un
til after the housing process has 
begun.
We should know sooner of RA 
decisions so that we can more 
readily prepare with our friends 
whom we will be rooming with, 
Lin said.
While some are set with re
tained rooms and prearranged 
roommates, many are still left 
wondering where they can live 
due to housing changes and room 
draw numbers.

Students experience Carnegie 
Mellon across the world in Qatar
LIKIDO from A1
some of whom came to visit the 
Carnegie Mellon-Pittsburgh 
campus before the start of the 
spring semester to experience 
Summit and see the campus 
with the hope of applying for 
exchange here.
The relationships we estab
lished made [the trip] worth 
it, Smith said.
Larcom played on the all
girls Qatari campus basket
ball team that traveled from 
Qatar to Bahrain, where the 
team played in a tournament of 
groups from all over the Middle 
East.
The Office of Student Activi
ties had been hesitant to give 
the group funding. However, 
the funding paid off when 
the group, led by Larcom, the 
teams star player, won the en
tire tournament.
Larcom played basketball on 
Monday nights with a co-ed 
group and with Qatars dean, 
who diligently showed up ev
ery week.
Where else can you play 
basketball every week with a 
dean? Smith asked.
Smith and Larcom also 
hosted a Thanksgiving dinner 
for their friends, both male and 
female. Since they were unfa
miliar with the rules of their 
dormitory, which prohibited 
male visitors, the dinner caused 
a ruckus that caused university' 
security to come to their door.
Our friends were outside, 
about a foot from our first-floor 
balcony, Smith said. Secu
rity said that they had come 
because of a noise complaint 
but we thought the issue might 
have been that there were boys 
were near our apartment.
The security guards also at
tempted to take pictures of the 
scene, an act that Smith and 
Larcom protested since in Qa
tar, a woman must give per
mission for her picture to be 
taken.
In addition to such cultural 
differences, they also had to 
deal with an extensive lan
guage barrier.
Smith and Larcom noticed
this barrier in talking with the 
security guard that came to 
their door at Thanskgiving, and 
in many other daily activities 
such as looking for bathrooms 
and maneuvering through a 
Middle Eastern train station.
At times, they wouldnt 
speak to us in English even 
though we knew they knew the 
language, Smith said, speak
ing particularly of the security 
guard at her apartment. This 
made it incredibly hard to 
communicate since we did not 
understand a word of Arabic.
Smith and Larcom lived in 
an apartment on the Carnegie 
Mellon campus, which was one 
of five encompassing the mega
campus of Education City.
Carnegie Mellon-Qatar, 
along with Virginia Common
wealth University, Weill Cor
nell Medical College in Qatar, 
Texas A&M University in Qa
tar, and Georgetown School of 
Foreign Service in Qatar, con
stitute Education City, a distin
guished center of learning in 
Doha, the capital of Qatar.
These five universities work 
in harmony, sharing facilities, 
ideas, and student interaction.
The biggest cooperative of 
American schools overseas, 
Education City has developed 
to be the elite of Qatari educa
tion.
Smith believes the initiative 
of Education City is based on 
a concept of education that is 
progressively gaining support.
In the Middle East, Dubai 
has a similar set up called 
Knowledge Village. The schools 
arent all American universi
ties, but the fever is spreading, 
she said in an e-mail. And the 
whole point of Education City 
is to educate students of the 
region, so [residents are] sup
portive.
Smith mentioned that the 
Carnegie Mellon name is 
steadily gaining a reputation in 
the Middle East.
In a New York Times article 
last week, Education City was 
even deemed an equivalent to 
American Ivy League schools 
in the Middle East.
Hanny Kamal, a first-year
on the Pittsburgh campus and 
Qatar resident, agreed with 
Smith.
In Qatar, the Carnegie Mel
lon name is associated with 
prestigious education and 
breakthrough research and ad
vance, he said.
Carnegie Mellon-Qatar is 
the first international branch 
campus managed by Carnegie 
Mellon University.
In August 2004, Carnegie 
Mellon-Qatar started making 
available its highly regarded 
undergraduate programs in 
computer science and business 
administration. This followed 
an invitation by the Qatar 
Foundation, a private, non
profit organization in the state 
of Qatar, founded in 1995 by 
His Highness Sheikh Hamad 
bin Khalifa Al-Thani, Emir of 
Qatar. The foundation is based 
on and guided by the principle 
that every nations best and 
most reliable resource is the 
potential of the individuals 
that comprise iti
Since then, Carnegie MellonQatar has also developed a pro
gram in information systems.
Larcom believes that the 
Carnegie Mellon-Qatar initia
tive is slowly reshaping the 
Qatari mentality and challeng
ing their traditional way of life 
for the better, benefiting all 
parties.
The institution of Carnegie 
Mellon and the overarching 
structure of the Qatar Founda
tion are making great strides in 
education, facilities, and mind
sets of the region, Larcom 
said in an e-mail. While some 
people might question the role 
of American universities in 
such a volatile region, I believe 
Carnegie Mellons relationship 
with Education City and the 
Gulf Region is beneficial for all 
involved. I certainly learned a 
lot, and I am sure that local stu
dents are benefiting as well.
Students interested in study
ing abroad in Qatar can acquire 
more information in the Office 
of Academic Development on 
the B-level of Cyert Hall.
The new study abroad program offered at Carnegie Mellon-Qatar offers students the chance to interact with 
Qatari students as course assistants, while at the same time becoming part of the Qatari community.
Illinois students mourn classmates
AMEEKTGHO fromAl
specifics have not j^et been 
released.
Northern Illinois police also 
said that there had been no red 
flags. Kazmierczak had been an 
outstanding student, winning 
several academic awards, and 
was popular among students, 
faculty, and staff.
While Northern Illinois po
lice do not know how long 
Kazmierczak had been plan
ning for his actions on Thurs
day, he had been buying guns 
since last December. He bought 
one in December, one in Au
gust, and two more guns and a 
holster on Feb. 4.
Kazmierczaks source for the 
last two guns showed an eerie 
connection to Virginia Techs 
violent shooting last April. He 
bought his last two firearms 
from a website operated by TGSCOM Inc., the same company 
that operated the website from 
which Seung-Hui Cho, the Vir
ginia Tech shooter, had bought 
his weapons. Cho went on to kill 
32 people before killing himself. 
However, Northern Illinois
police have concluded that the 
website is a coincidence, and 
that the shooting bears no con
nection to the Virginia Tech 
massacre.
Northern Illinois Univer
sity has received condolences 
from every direction, includ
ing President George W. Bush, 
Barack Obama, and the presi
dent of Virginia Tech. Cohon 
has written to Northern Illinois 
University President Peters ex
pressing condolences on behalf 
of Carnegie Mellon faculty, 
stuff, and students. Cohon also 
issued an e-mail letter to the 
Carnegie Mellon community 
offering condolences and coun
seling services, and informing 
people of new campus safety 
measures.
I also encourage you to 
register for our Alert Now Emer
gency Notification Service, 
Cohon wrote in the e-mail.
The Alert Now system 
was put into place after the 
Virginia Tech massacre; 6500 
students, faculty, and staff have 
already subscribed. The service 
automatically sends out text 
messages or voicemails when
a campus emergency issue has 
been raised. Members of the 
Carnegie Mellon community 
can subscribe in a matter of sec
onds at www.cmu.edu/alert. 
For those not subscribed to this 
service, updates will always be 
available on the Carnegie Mel
lon homepage and web portal.
Teresa Thomas, assistant vice 
president of media relations for 
Carnegie Mellon, explained 
that the university is always 
working to improve safety pro
cedures.
Carnegie Mellon has a team 
that conducts drills on a vari
ety of emergency management 
protocols from shootings to 
accidents to pandemics. Our 
campus police also drill with 
state police experts on scenar
ios like this, Thomas said.
Cohon insisted in his e-mail 
that at times like these, one 
must take comfort in the uni
versity community.
I remain grateful for the 
supportive community of which 
we are all a part, including your 
attention to the safety and secu
rity of all its members, Cohon 
wrote.

more reason to come and learn 
something new.
Jessica said that another goal 
addressed during planning was 
community empowerment, in ad
dition to using resources outside 
of campus and within Pittsburgh. 
There was also a focus on cultural 
identity, combining an understand
ing of student experiences with an 
eye on future possibilities.
This month kicked off with the 
fifth annual Black Caucus Recep
tion Friday, Feb. 1.
Evan Frazier, alumnus of the 
Heinz School class of 1997 and 
president and CEO of Pittsburghs 
Hill House Association, gave the 
keynote address in Rangos 2 and 3 
in the University Center.
The Hill House on Centre Avenue 
hosts events and neighborhood 
initiatives aimed at underprivi
leged families and children. In his 
speech, Frazier told students of the 
immense rewards available from 
giving back to the community.
The lecture on the history of 
Islam in the African-American 
community was given by Univer
sity of Pittsburgh faculty member 
Arif Jamal on Feb. 5. The lecture 
was a first-time collaboration' 
between the Muslim Students As
sociation (MSA) and the Office of 
Student Development for BHM.
The lecture was unique to this 
years BHM and aimed to empha
size the prevalence of Islam in the 
United States.
Islam is not a foreign religion 
in the U.S.; rather it is among the 
old religions here. It tells them 
[the black community] a big part 
of the history [of Islam in the U.S.]

The fact that MSA came to the 
BHM committee shows that con
nections in unlikely places can 
be made, M. Shernell said. The 
collaboration on the event shows 
the campus community spirit of 
bringing together multi-cultural 
organizations and empowers other 
groups to see what they can contrib
ute to the campus community.
The BHM events included the 
collaboration and planning of sev
eral other student groups.
UC Late Night Renaissance,
. hosted by Black Graduate Student 
Organization (BGSO) on Feb. 9, 
featured student performances, 
including gospel and R&B, poetry, 
and more.
Brandon J. Carson, president of 
BGSO and a Heinz School graduate 
student, emphasized that students 
at Carnegie Mellon are part of a 
greater citywide community, and 
that oftentimes a sense of togeth
erness is the d^aw for people of all 
cultures to come to events. Carson 
spoke of large participation that 
brought together students from 
University of Pittsburgh, Point 
Park, and Duquesne. He also rec
ognized the value of focusing on 
the event, not the people you ex
pect to show up.
Some of the weeks events were 
brought back from prior years due 
to popular demand as some stu
dents had complained that recent 
BHM celebrations on campus had 
been lacking. The gospel concert 
Redefined, held on Feb. 10, was 
one such event.
This weeks coming events in
clude a number of other student 
performances.
Students bring so much en
ergy to events, M. Shernell 
said.
Fatis Last Dance, written by 
graduate playwright FranceLuce Benson, will be showing 
in Purnell through Feb. 23. The 
event is appropriate for BHM, 
as it displays Haitian-American 
culture.
The School of Drama is also 
performing The Piano Lesson by 
Pittsburgh native August Wil
son. The play opens Thursday 
and runs through March 1.
Students are also encouraged 
to participate in open forum 
events throughout the week.
On Feb. 20, SPIRIT is hosting 
a discussion of the Willie Lynch 
Letter, a controversial document 
that emerged on the Internet in 
1990. Held in Doherty Hall 1112 
from 6:30 to 8:30 p.m., the dis
cussion will center on the piece 
and its effects on society today.
BHM gives the opportunity 
for cultural conversation and 
should encourage people to think 
how they can continue the con
versation even after the month is 
over, M. Shernell said.
BHM should not only be cel
ebrated in a specific designated 
place or time, it should be a con
versation piece for people to take 
into their daily lives.
The schedule for BHM is avail
able at www.cmu.edu/news/

Presidents 
get older
RDPATYPGKAO fromAl 
Cohon.
Appointed by the Board of 
Trustees in 1997, Cohon is in 
his eleventh year of office, hav
ing been approved for his third 
five-year term in 2007. At the 
end of his third term in 2012, 
Cohon will have nearly doubled 
the national average with a to
tal of 15 years in office.
The study also analyzed the 
ages of the presidents.
In 2006, the percentage of 
university presidents over the 
age of 60 was 49.3, compared 
with only 13.9 percent in 1986. 
Jacqueline E. King, assistant 
vice president of the American 
Council on Education, com
mented in a press release on the 
age of current presidents and 
those likely to succeed them.
The good news is that those 
in the positions that are feeder 
positions are in fact younger 
 so there will be someone to 
take over, King said in a press 
release. These feeder positions 
include titles such as provost or 
chief academic officer, the most 
common position from which a 
person rises to the presidency. 
Compared to the large percent
age for university presidents, 
only 20.5 percent of provosts 
are above the age of 60.
However, this is not the only 
position from which presidents 
are drawn.
Cohon came to Carnegie 
Mellon as president directly 
from Yale University, where 
he was dean of the School'of 
Forestry and Environmental 
Studies and a professor of en
vironmental systems analysis. 
He joined Yale after 19 years 
at Johns Hopkins University, 
where he was associate dean of 
engineering and vice provost 
for research.
According to the study, deans 
have about the same age distri
bution as provosts.
Andy Brantley, CEO of the 
College and University Profes
sional Association for Human 
Resources, spoke in Inside 
Higher Ed about the importance 
of planning ahead.
With succession planning, 
presidents and institutions can 
reach out to those with poten
tial for senior positions and 
groom them, he said.
However, with presidential 
terms increasing as they have 
over the past 20 years, presi
dents may not be leaving any
time soon.
It is a tremendous honor 
and great privilege to be in a 
role like this, Cohon said of his 
presidency at Carnegie Mellon.
Cohon also spoke of his tran
sition from an academic to a 
senior administrative leader. 
As an academic, one can do 
research, see student names on 
papers, and watch them grow. 
Presidents have to get gratifica
tion out of more institutional 
success. I do.
Cohon noted that some presi
dents have troubl adjusting to 
this transition.
Its about Carnegie Mellon, 
not about you, Cohon added. 
You have to submerge your 
ego a little bit.

Flu shot does not 
cover all viruses
Getting a flu shot will only 
protect against 40 percent of 
this years strains of the flu vi
rus, according to the Centers 
for Disease Control and Preven
tion.
While the number of flu cases 
has remained the same over the 
last three years, this winter, an 
unexpected strain of the virus 
that is resistant to the vaccine 
has been spreading rapidly. 
Under more favorable circum
stances, the vaccine can prevent 
70 to 90 percent of all strains of 
the virus.
As a result, the World Health 
Organization has recom
mended that scientists com
pletely revamp the vaccine for 
next years flu season. The U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration 
will decide how to proceed with 
the U.S. vaccine sometime next 
week.

Global warming 
may reduce deaths
Milder winters due to global 
warming may reduce the num
ber of cold weather-related 
deaths, the UK Department of 
Heath says.
While hotter summers may 
generally cause about 6000 
deaths, the number of heatrelated deaths is far lower than 
those related to cold weather.
However, scientists warn that 
excess heat caused by global 
warming could increase the 
occurrence of other diseases, 
including skin cancer, breath
ing difficulties, and food-borne 
illnesses.
In addition, heavy rain in
creases the level of bacteria in 
drinking water and makes wa

Scientists suggest 
breath tests
Researchers are working to 
develop a way to analyze com
pounds in patients breath to 
test for cancer, diabetes, and 
other diseases.
While the idea of such a 
device is not new, current mod
els can be unreliable, scientists 
say.
The new method would iden
tify unique markers of certain 
diseases, creating a more accu
rate method to diagnose serious 
diseases. In addition, the tests 
would be cheaper and less in
vasive than current diagnostic 
methods.

Doctors promote 
medical marijuana
The American College of Phy
sicians has asked the federal 
government to look beyond the 
high abuse rate of marijuana, 
and stop classifying marijuana 
as a substance with no medi
cal value. They believe that the 
government should consider its 
health benefits.
Furthermore, the group 
asked the government to lighten 
restrictions on marijuana 
research and not penalize doc
tors who prescribe marijuana 
to their patients in states where 
medical marijuana use is legal.
The argument was stated in 
a 13-page paper written on be
half of the 124,000 members of 
the ACP, the largest-ever group 
to make such a request.
While the federal govern
ment is resistant to exploring 
the potential medical uses of 
marijuana, 12 states have al
ready legalized marijuana use 
for medical reasons.

How Things Work: Search engines
Search engines have become an integral part of our daily lives.
GRANT NEWSOME
Junior Staffwriter
Everyday, millions of individu
als and organizations worldwide 
browse the Internet to carry out 
all sorts of research and analy
ses.
One of the great features of 
researching online is the vast 
amount of information available 
to the users.
From recipes to TV listings to 
items for sale, virtually anything 
can be found in the vast realm of 
the Internet. However, without 
knowing the URL, finding what 
you need may prove to be rather 
cumbersome. This is where 
search engines come in.
Search engines are interesting 
pieces of technology, as they are 
radically different from regular 
websites.
Instead of storing the 
information by itself, a search 
engine categorizes information 
by words, linking websites that 
relate to these words. This tech
nology is improved every year, 
allowing the big search engine 
names such as Google, Yahoo, 
and MSN to be able to pull up 
hundreds of millions of web 
pages in just a fraction of a sec
ond.
A search engine collects large 
amounts of data through a multi
faceted technology called web 
crawling. Web crawling involves 
an automated piece of software
known as the spider. The spi
der goes to the root of a site and 
indexes keywords, images, or 
phrases that it collects by crawl
ing through the site itself, then 
creates a link that the engine can 
use to relay the site address to 
the user when they search.
This is a very simplified re
flection upon how this software 
works, as it is incredibly compli
cated and often involves several 
different approaches.
Two ways that companies use 
spiders can be seen with the 
Google and AltaVista search 
engines. Google, when using a 
spider to find information, looks 
at the source page of the specific 
website. This allows Google to 
not only extract information off 
of the site, but also to store this. 
site for the use of their users.
AltaVista uses a much more' 
generic approach of simply scan
ning all of the words on a given 
site and indexing them as fast as 
possible and as appropriately.
To index is to take the infor
mation gathered off of a website 
(generally through the spider) 
and store it so that when the user 
searches the data it can be ac
cessed efficiently.
This is probably the most 
important part of the process, 
simply because the speed in 
which the user can pull data 
out of the server that stores it is 
rather quick.
Generally, when a site is indexed, the spider picks out some 
of the main words or phrases of 
a given website and places them 
first on the priority list, making 
them more likely to be found 
when users search for specific 
items.
For example, if a spider is 
indexing a website that gives 
instructions on making a deli
cious pumpkin pie, it is more 
likely that the phrase pumpkin 
pie will show up, rather than 
delicious or sugar.
During this part of the pro
cess a search engine looks inside 
the code of the website itself for 
items called meta tags. These 
allow web developers to add 
keywords to their websites that 
search engines will pick up.
This speeds up the index
ing process and makes it more 
efficient, as the authors of the 
website are more likely to put 
relevant keywords in the meta 
tags to attract users to the site 
through the search engines.
Also, the meta tags make it 
easier for the search engine to 
identify which definition of a 
specific word is being looked up, 
depending on the contexts of the 
various web pages. This is espe
cially helpful when a particular 
word has more than one mean
ing, and thus, allows the search 
engine to provide more accurate 
results.
The last and most obvious step 
in the process is that of the search
ing itself. When you prompt the 
engine, or ask for something spe
cific and hit search, the engine 
will quickly pull the information 
out of its index by looking at the 
keywords given by the user and 
relating it to the keywords lo
cated in the index.
Generally, a search engine is 
only as good as the relevance 
of the results generated by said 
search. In terms of the pumpkin 
pie analogy, if the user were to 
search for the words pumpkin 
and pie, the search engine 
would begin to retrieve informa
tion on how to bake apple and 
cherry pies, in addition to pump
kin pie. However, before the 
results go to the user, the search 
engine filters out the search 
results so that only the pumpkinrelated pages remained.
Search engines are powerful 
instruments of technology, and 
through their web crawling, in
dexing, and searching they allow 
users to get any information they 
want in a very fast manner.
Some of the biggest companies 
in the world began and are still 
primarily search engine compa
nies, simply due to the amount 
of revenue they can generate by 
putting ads on their website with 
the amount of people that visit 
them.
They are a main focal point on 
how information is exchanged, 
on the Internet, not to mention 
one'of its most popular features.
Students compete to be Mr. Engineer
On Friday night, students crowded McConomy Auditorium to watch their male classmates compete for the tide of Mr. Engineer. Students from all 
engineering disciplines were invited to compete and the entire campus community was welcome to attend. Prior to the competition, one student 
from each of the engineering disciplines represented their major, as Mr. ChemE or Mr. MechE for example, and these six representatives then 
competed in Fridays show to be the coveted Mr. Engineer. The winner was Mr. ECE, junior Boris Lipchin, and the runner-up was Mr. Mystery, 
first-year student Brian Hoskins (pictured above), whose major is undecided.

change in shape and migration 
of an organ. For example, the 
computer can calculate the rate 
at which a tumor will spread in 
the case of cancer.
The user can feel the virtual 
organs with the help of a pen
like 3D mouse, which replaces 
the regular mouse and keyboard 
in this interactive version.
The technology has been a 
vital factor in breast cancer de

GPS detects 
temperature change
A new technique called GPS 
radio occultation has been 
discovered for detecting temper
ature fluctuations. It acts like a 
thermometer and helps monitor 
climate change.
GPS satellites send signals 
to satellites in low-Earth or
bits. These signals are refracted 
at certain angles as they pass 
through the atmosphere. The 
angle of refraction depends on 
temperature and the amount of 
water vapor present in the atmo
sphere.
The system is very sensitive 
to atmospheric variations. It is 
predicted that this method can 
also be used to detect strong 
man-made signals as well as 
temperature changes.

Biotech crops on the 
rise
In spite of the potential risks 
of genetically engineered crops 
being widely realized and ac
cepted, farmers in 12 developing 
countries planted biotech crops 
in 2007, outnumbering the in
dustrialized countries that grow 
the same crops.
Genetically engineered crops 
require reduced pesticide spray
ing and generate greater yield. 
This helps farmers, as engi
neered crops reduces the cost of 
production and increases prof
its.
A report from the 
International Service for the 
Acquisition of Agri-biotech Ap
plications states that America 
continues to dominate the world 
of biotech agriculture, with 142 
million acres being covered by 
engineered crops.
Argentina, with an area of
47.2 million acres of biotech 
crops like corn, soy, and cotton, 
led developing countries.

Researchers put lens 
in rodent brain
Japanese researchers im
planted a camera inside a 
mouses brain to study memory 
formation and behavior. The 
special semi-conductor camera 
was .1 inch wide (3 by 2.3 by 2.4 
millimeters) and was implanted 
inside the hippocampus region 
of the brain.
A blue light on the screen indi
cates memory being recorded by 
the brain as the camera captures 
the light. Researchers intend to 
use the camera while the mouse 
walks.
It is expected that the camera 
will be able to track brain activi
ties that trigger symptoms such 
as tremors. The study will help 
in giving insights into ways to 
treat diseases like Parkinsons in 
humans.

Health Talk: Dyslexia
AKANKSHA VAIDYA
Staffwriter
My frenbs bot me meny qresents. That sentence probably 
does not make much sense.
It would be quite normal for 
a 5- or 6-year-old child to write 
a sentence like that, and expect 
people to read it as, My friends 
bought me many presents. But 
one would not expect a 9- or 
10-year-old to write like that. 
Such a child would probably be 
termed as a slow learner or in 
blunt words, dumb. However, 
such children are far from dumb; 
in fact, many have IQ levels that 
are higher than the average. The 
only difference between children 
who write sentences like the 
one above and children who can 
write with fewer errors is that 
they suffer from a disorder called 
dyslexia.
Dyslexia is a learning disor
der characterized by difficulty in 
reading and writing. However, 
dyslexia is not limited to reading 
and writing problems.
Dyslectics tend to be dreamy 
and lose focus easily. They also 
tend to have poor motor skills. 
For example, they might find it 
hard to catch a ball thrown at 
them. Giving directions is dif
ficult as well, as dyslectics often 
confuse left and right. Although 
the disorder manifests itself in 
many ways, understanding let
ters and numbers is the prime 
difficulty faced by dyslectics.
Dyslectics have trouble spell
ing words that are not spelled the 
way they are pronounced. Since 
many languages, including Eng
lish, are filled with such words, 
people with dyslexia tend to 
make many spelling mistakes.
Remembering the spellings of 
words is very difficult for dys
lexic individuals, and they tend 
to spell words differently each 
time they write them. That is 
why island may be written as 
iland once and then ilund in 
the very next sentence.
Letters and numbers appear 
to be disfigured, unclear, or even 
dancing to dyslectics. They 
often get confused with the cur
vatures of letters. So, b could 
be confused with d or p could
-

c
1 I
A dyslectic mispells words, normally writing them out the way they are pronounced, in addition to jumbling the order of the letters.

be confused for q. Likewise, 
14 could be 41 or 54 could be 
45; even when individuals know 
what to do with the numbers, 
without knowing what the num
bers are it is virtually impossible 
for them to perform operations.
Organizational skills are also 
a major problem in the life of a 
dyslectic. If a non-dyslexic indi
vidual were told to open a specific 
page in a book and highlight the 
fifth word of the second sentence 
in the third paragraph, he or she 
would probably be able to do it. 
A dyslectic, however, would be 
dumbfounded by the rapid flow
of instructions.
Scientists studying dyslexia 
were initially baffled by all these 
symptoms. Even today, the exact 
neural mechanisms that cause 
dyslexia are unknown. However, 
recent research has led to some 
insights about the disorder.
Researchers at the Yale Uni
versity school of Medicine have 
conducted numerous fMRI 
(functional magnetic resonance 
imaging) studies on people with 
dyslexia. The studies show that 
the Wernickes area, a region at 
the back of the brain that par
tially makes up the cortex, is
not activated in dyslectics. The 
Wernickes area is associated 
with language comprehension. 
Furthermore, areas of the visual 
cortex that process vision are 
not activated at a normal level. 
These areas are known to help 
in deciphering written or printed 
letters; low activation of these 
areas matches many of dyslexias 
symptoms.
Scientists also discovered that 
the areas of the brain that are in
active in dyslectics are the same 
areas that caused reading prob
lems in adults when damaged 
due to a stroke or an accident.
This discovery strengthened the 
link between dyslexia and brain 
function, but further research 
needs to be carried out to dis
cover the exact areas of the brain 
that are affected.
Scientists also suspect a 
genetic link to the disorder. ^li 
cording to an article in the online 
journal Science News, research
ers at the Karolinska Institute in 
Sweden have identified a gene 
called DYXC1 on chromosome 15 
, which may be linked to dyslexia. 
The genetic link to the disorder 
still cannot be generalized to all 
cases and scientists are continu
ally researching this field.
As of today, our knowledge 
tells us that dyslexia has no cure 
and the only way to deal with the 
disorder is to adapt certain spe
cial teaching strategies when it 
comes to dyslexic students.
Teachers of dyslexic stu
dents employ a multi-sensory 
approach while teaching. The stu
dents do not have to learn to read 
by using just their eyes, but also 
auditory devices like cassettes or 
CDs that read the words to them. 
This helps dyslectics better un
derstand the phonics behind the 
words. Similarly, making letters 
and numbers physically by using 
clay or tape helps the students 
understand the curvatures of let
ters.
Given time and proper atten* 
tion, people with dyslexia can 
overcome the disorder and read 
and write at a fairly normal level. 
The severity of the disorder is 
also a key factor in determining 
the recovery rate.
Additionally, if dyslexia is not 
recognized early on, many dys
lectics who have a multitude 
of hidden talents may fail to 
discover them because of their 
disability.
Some of the most influential 
and intelligent people of our 
time have been diagnosed with 
a form of dyslexia. Albert Ein
stein is probably one of the most 
famous examples of someone 
who overcame such a learning 
disability. According to an ar
ticle in NeuroPsychiatry Reviews, 
researchers have proposed that 
Einstein suffered from develop
mental dyslexia.
Thomas Edison also showed 
similar symptoms. Edison was 
quoted saying, My teachers say 
Im addled ... my father thought 
I was stupid, and I almost de
cided I must be a dunce. Other 
examples of childhood dunces 
include Leonardo Da Vinci, Ag
atha Christie, and Tom Cruise.
These examples show that 
dyslexia cannot stop a person 
from learning and fulfilling their 
dreams. It may be an inconve
nience, but it certainly doesnt 
prevent a person from leading a 
purposeful life.

Tony Spear talks on Lunar X PRIZE
MARIUM CHANDNA
SciTech Editor
Tony Spear, a Carnegie Mel
lon alumnus and NASA veteran, 
engaged students and faculty in 
a lighthearted and informative 
discussion about the endeavors 
of the Google Lunar X PRIZE 
Team in a lecture titled What 
Goes Around, Comes Around 
last Thursday.
The Google Lunar X PRIZE is 
an aeronautics competition for 
privately funded teams to send a 
robot to the moon. The competi
tion mandates that a successful 
robot should travel 500 meters 
and broadcast video, images, and 
data back to Earth. The first team 
to achieve this target by 2012 
will be awarded $20 million.
Spear, the project manager of 
the Google Lunar X PRIZE team 
at Carnegie Mellon, began at
tending Carnegie Tech as an 
undergraduate student in 1958, 
graduating with a B.S. degree in 
electrical engineering in 1962. 
He specializes in coordinating 
automotive aspects of space
crafts, and was also the project 
manager in the Mars Pathfinder 
mission, a project similar to the 
Google Lunar X Prize, which in
volved sending a free-ranging 
robot to Mars. The robot landed 
successfully on Mars on July 4, 
1997.
At Carnegie Mellon, under
standing the problem and the 
approach to the solution is more 
important than the answer [it
self], said Spear, speaking of his 
return to Carnegie Mellon after
46 years to join William Red 
Whittaker and his team as they 
compete for the Google Lunar X 
PRIZE.
During the lecture, Spear 
showed his audience a film that 
described the process of com
pleting the Mars Pathfinder mis
sion. The video depicted Spear 
and his colleagues as they antici
pated the success of their plan. It 
also showed a robotic rover, So
journer, making its way through 
the planets crimson terrain.
With 36 years of experience 
at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory 
(JPL) at NASA, Spear is ready to 
work with Whittaker and Carn
egie Mellon to achieve this mile
stone in space exploration.
The moon rover, however, 
will be subjected to a harsher 
environment than the Pathfinder 
robot was. Boiling noon temper
atures and icy nights may expose 
the robot to irreversible damage. 
However, the Robotics Institute 
at Carnegie Mellon began de
veloping methods to overcome 
these environmental hurdles al
most two decades ago to make 
safe and successful lunar mis
sions possible.
As stated on the Carnegie 
Mellon X PRIZE team website,
a possible design for the teams 
robot entry would be a sun-synchronous rover, which would 
continually move westward, 
thus following the sun. This de
sign would protect the robots 
mechanical components and 
batteries from the freezing cold 
of the lunar night.
Due to the moons proximity 
to Earth, the robot will be able 
to transmit a high-bandwidth 
reciprocal interaction. Carnegie 
Mellons robot for the competi
tion, which is currently under 
construction, will have multiple 
cameras attached to it to satisfy 
requirements of the competition 
to transmit video, photos, and in
formation back to Earth.
The moon rover will land on 
the site of Apollo 11, where Neil 
Armstrong first landed on the 
moon. The robot will transmit 
high-resolution photo and video 
images from the momentous site 
on the moon.
Its a very fun project. As a 
child, I created a LEGO model 
of Spears Pathfinder robot, 
said John Thornton, a Carnegie 
Mellon alumnus and research 
engineer on the project. It is a 
chance of a lifetime to work with 
Tony Spear, the man who was be
hind that, he added.
According to Spear, the most 
challenging part of this journey 
to the moon is to achieve pin
point landing. Pinpoint landing

The Google Lunar X PRIZE worth $20 million will go to the first team to land its robot on the moon.
refers to the process of landing 
on a small ellipse within the gi
gantic surface area of the moon.
Toward the end of the lecture, 
Spear advised students on pos
sible volunteer and employment 
opportunities outside the engi
neering facets of spacecraft proj
ect management. Spear said that 
class activities are an ideal way 
to begin working on ones project 
management skills.
While Carnegie Mellons X 
PRIZE team works towards its
goal of launching a robot to the 
moon, Spear intends to shuffle 
between Pasadena, Calif., Tuc
son, Ariz., and Pittsburgh for 
work on the project as the space 
explorers pursue the $20 million 
prize.

Other nations shouldnt be 
required to legitimize U.S. fears
strict. This is not a risk worth taking, es
pecially since there is no data suggest
ing that extra screening of passengers 
families has resulted in easier identifi
cation of terrorism suspects.
European newspapers have already 
voiced their discontent for Bushs plan. The 
Guardian, a London newspaper, stated in 
a Feb. 11 article, Bush orders clampdown 
on flights to U.S., that the plan is a form 
of blackmail and will result in nothing but 
trouble. It also pointed out that if European 
countries do not comply, their citizens 
may be forced to get visas to visit the U.!sv 
which would make the process of visiting 
our country that much more of a hassle.
The article makes a valid point: The U.S. 
should not test the patience of the Euro
pean Union, which is one of the strongest 
allies the country has had in past years. ' 
Bush seems to lack respect for the safety 
of other countries  why should the rest 
of the world respect his concerns for Amer
ica? Under Bush, the U.S. has invaded Af
ghanistan and Iraq, killing millions of ci
vilians. Bush has also continued a policy of 
economic domination of third-world counT 
tries like Nicaragua and Indonesia, with al
most no concern for the ideals of freedom 
and democracy. The U.S., in this light, is no 
longer a beacon of hope; it is a bully, much 
like the imperialist powers of the past.
As Bush pushes this plan and others 
like it, politicians in Washington should 
keep in mind that the U.S. is not the only 
country worth protecting. Making a de
cision without fully evaluating its conse
quences is something thats happened all 
too often under Bushs reign, and these 
transatlantic regulations could lead to 
potentially damaging consequences.
The U.S. government needs to stop 
being naive and wake up to the fact that 
our country is not alone in its need for 
protection.
FromTheEditorialBoard
2008George Bush is at it again.
Under the pretense of national se
curity, Bush is proposing new transAtlantic airline safety measures  and 
expecting foreign nations to comply.
One measure will require passengers 
to provide airlines with extended infor
mation on their family members, which 
could thwart possible terrorist threats.
The rationale behind the plan is that it 
will increase safety for American citi
zens, as Homeland Security will then 
theoretically deter terrorists from enter
ing the U.S. by gathering as much infor
mation as possible beforehand.
Its true  this measure could make 
America a safer place. But what Bush 
and his misguided advisers fail to realize 
is that such a move will have both shortand long-term consequences. In the short 
term, implementing stricter travel guide
lines will increase worldwide hostility 
towards American power, especially in 
already-weary regions such as the Middle 
East and Central Asia. Bushs proposed 
trans-Atlantic travel policies will only 
promote further mistrust in our lead
ers, companies, and, unfortunately, our 
people.
With respect to long-term effects, Bushs 
plan could make travel to the U.S. even 
more complex than it is now. The proposed 
changes will cause the tourism industry 
to suffer, which could prove damaging to 
an already weakening U.S. economy. As a 
retaliatory move, European Union nations 
could require U.S. citizens to get visas be
fore traveling abroad; they might be pro
filed simply for being American. This isnt 
something we want to happen.
Also, European businesses could 
start moving to countries such as China Akshay Dave (asdave@) is a first-year
and India, where travel rules are not as ECE major.

be punished for doing what we want to 
do academically? Why spend four years

left unsatisfied (and potentially jobless)

I dont think there are any sufficient

Education City makes academic strides
Its natural for American universi
ties to try to anticipate problems in an 
effort to cut their losses. However, we 
believe that Carnegie Mellons programs 
in Qatar will help far more than hurt. 
First, the program provides a top-tier 
education to hundreds of students who 
otherwise might not receive one. Sec
ond, the program is mutually beneficial, 
providing opportunities for students in 
Qatar to study at home and abroad in 
Pittsburgh, as well as the opportunity 
for students and faculty at Carnegie 
Mellons Pittsburgh campus to learn and 
teach in Qatar and experience life out
side of the United States. This is the goal 
of the global university, and were glad 
that The New York Times has recognized 
Carnegie Mellons global success.
These programs offer the highestachieving students of the Middle East the 
chance to receive top-notch educations 
that will prepare them to work in the 
global marketplace and give them an ad
vantage over others in their respective 
fields. For the universities, these programs 
also introduce a host of often-unanswerable questions. How much should a uni
versity localize the curriculum to match 
the values and culture of the program 
country? Will American taxpayers end up 
financing the education of non-American 
students abroad? What happens if rela
tions between the U.S. and Qatar deterio
rate? Will foreign institutions and foreign 
students trained in American methods 
hurt the competitiveness of American stu
dents and industries?
Last week, The New York Times pub
lished a series of articles about the 
global university  a phrase thats 
been used to describe Carnegie Mellon 
since 2005, when the Carnegie MellonQatar campus opened in Education City, 
a 2500-acre campus in Doha, Qatar. 
Now, Education City is home to branch 
campuses of four other American Uni
versities. In addition to studying busi
ness, computer science, and now in
formation systems at Carnegie Mellon, 
Qataris, Bangladeshis, Syrians, Indians, 
and Egyptians can study pre-med at Cor
nell, art and design at Virginia Common
wealth University, engineering at Texas 
A&M, foreign service at Georgetown, 
and soon, journalism at Northwestern, 
without ever leaving home.
CNN gives nod to citizen journalists
On Friday, I had the second of many 
mental breakdowns to come this se
mester. I confess that I might have been 
overeager when I decided to involve 
myself in several extracurriculars, an 
internship, and a job (I mean, I still have 
to eat), while failing to realize that these 
things on top of my course load would 
prove nearly fatal. And for what?
Ill tell you what. My damn resume.
As a writing major, countless sources 
encourage me to get as much experience 
as I can and decide what field I want to 
follow. Being the ambitious person I 
sometimes regret myself to be, I chose 
publishing as my passion. That means 
I need experience at the newspaper, 
an internship, and some quality design 
experience. The publishing field, so elu
sive and grand, always wants more.
But the aforementioned elusive and 
grand field isnt always a world of un
necessarily attractive people and super 
couture, like in Ugly Betty and The Devil 
Wears Prada. These shows and movies 
with which we are so fascinated actu
ally just provide a glimpse into the over
achieving, stressful life that I may some
day have to lead to get where I want.
(Although, in my life, there will be no 
Henry, no man Im secretly in love with 
who has to go back to Tucson to care for his 
baby momma. A girl can only be so lucky.)
But will I even get that far? Lets be hon
est: Writing majors dont get jobs. People 
who follow their artistically-inclined 
dreams are left living in grimy cardboard 
boxes at night, waiting tables during the 
day, and hearing one too many I-told-yousos in between. Wheres the love?

THETARTAN.ORG/FORUMTHE TARTAN FEBRUARY 18, 2008A11
Influx of immigrants raises social, economic questions
IUIGYI SEBP
A recent study conducted by 
the Pew Research Center proj
ects an increase in the percentage 
of foreign-born residents of the 
United States within the next sev
eral years. The study concluded 
that more of the workforce will 
be foreign-born, most of whom 
will be unable to vote because 
they will not be citizens.
This increase will cause tensions 
among American residents as non
citizen immigrants realize that 
they are contributing economi
cally, but not getting the same 
benefits as citizens, such as voting 
and Social Security benefits.
Legal or not, immigrants are 
still pouring into this country en 
masse, and most of them are com
ing to make better lives for their 
families by getting better jobs in a 
more stable environment than the 
ones they left behind. While many 
Americans complain that immi
grants are stealing our jobs, they 
are, in fact, helping to support the 
population of elderly and minor 
citizens through their work.
Face itAmericans are getting 
older, and as they age, they retire. 
Elderly Americans often rely upon 
government programs such as 
Social Security and Medicare in
order to survive after retirement, 
and these programs have to be 
funded by taxes taken from pay
checks. As the country ages and 
Baby Boomers continue to retire, 
more of our citizens will depend 
upon this aid, and far fewer will 
be working to help fund it.
An immigrant workforce can
 and will  help this. With 
the projected rise in immigration 
rates, we will see a rise in the per
centage of the population (legal 
or not) who are able to work. This 
will allow for the proper funding 
of government aid programs.
But how can we justify this? 
The new immigrant population
 who at first arent even able 
to vote  will be paying for pro
grams to aid the American elder
ly when they arent eligible to 
receive such benefits themselves
 that is, unless they become 
citizens, which many immigrants 
cant afford to do.
The governments policy 
should change to allow for the 
fair treatment of immigrants. Its 
time to realize that foreign-born 
residents make up a significant 
part of our population, and even 
if they cant afford to become citi
zens, they should receive some 
sort of financial benefits for the 
taxes that they pay.
The study reported that about 
82 percent of the increase in popu
lation by 2050 in the United States 
will be due to immigration, while 
percentages of the white and black
populations in America will drop 
or remain unchanged. The pro
jected population in 2050 is only
47 percent white and 13 percent 
black. Because most of the new 
working population will be immi
grants  and mostly Hispanic 
immigrants  the cultural divide 
in America will become more pro
nounced. Hispanic workers will 
be paying to support the non-Hispanic elderly population, creat
ing a tense cultural situation. We 
need to narrow this gap and make 
it possible for immigrants to be 
on an equal level with the native 
population.
The bigger issue than the cul
tural problem, however, is that 
most of the immigrants who will 
be supporting the elderly arent 
able to vote  meaning that they 
cant vote against taxes or vote 
for Social Security reforms. They 
have to pay without being rep
resented, which seems almost 
tyrannical. Even if they are here 
illegally, its never right to tax 
someone without their input.
In addition to financial issues, 
there will be another hotly debat
ed issue in the forefront of politics
 that of the languages of the 
United States, and whether or not 
an official one should be select
ed. With such a large number of 
Hispanic immigrants arriving, it 
is difficult to ignore the language 
barrier that will be emphasized 
with this influx. Currently, many 
people believe that English should
be the only official language of 
the country; the nation was, after 
all, founded by English-speaking 
leaders, and English is a huge part 
of our history.
This is a very valid point, but 
we shouldnt completely ignore 
the growing use of Spanish by 
American residents. A good solu
tion would be to incorporate both 
languages, but in very different 
capacities. Because English is 
such a large part of our coun
try, it should be the only official 
language of the United States; 
Spanish, however, should be con
sidered an unofficial language at 
most, as we should expect that 
immigrants will respect our tra
ditions and learn our language 
upon choosing to live here. No 
matter what, immigrants should 
be able to communicate with the 
citizens of the country into which 
they move.
To accommodate Hispanic 
immigrants, many businesses 
have begun offering services in 
Spanish, and it is increasingly 
common to see Spanish direc
tions listed on products and signs 
with Spanish translations. Since 
the number of Hispanic citizens 
of the United States will only 
increase in the coming years, it is 
necessary that we find a solution 
to the language barrier problem.
The answer may be to teach 
new Americans English, or to 
offer all public services in both 
English and Spanish. Both of these
potential solutions, though, will 
undoubtedly create other prob
lems. For instance, who will pay 
for the new immigrants to learn 
English? Is it right to ask taxpay
ers to do so? And what about 
the rest of the population, those 
who dont speak Spanish?
Solving this problem is not 
a process to be taken lightly. 
There are many issues at stake, 
and every solution has its set
backs. In other countries and 
cultures, immigrants must 
assimilate themselves into the 
community and learn the local 
language  and the United 
States should not necessarily be 
different. The same should be 
true of immigrants arriving to 
the United States. Immigrants 
should learn English; the only 
question is in how to do it in the 
fairest way possible  for both 
citizens and non-citizens.
Whether we look at the 
issues in the economy or the 
issues concerning language, the 
increase in Hispanic residents 
of the United States will require 
changes in government poli
cies, as well as changes in the 
ways the country operates. The 
question lies, then, in how the 
changes will be implemented, 
and whether they will be benefi
cial for our country.

Environmental consciousness follows new ways of thinking
ZPAATSI KMNDAKEG
I dont have the exact program 
for how to maintain a wholly sus
tainable lifestyle. I cant give you 
a laundry list of environmentally 
preferable products that you 
must rush out and purchase to 
redecorate your apartment so 
that you may be instantly trendy 
and eco-friendly. I hope to not 
come off as preachy, and I wont 
try to convince you to ditch your 
SUV for a hybrid sedan or strip 
off your jeans in favor of an 
organic cotton tunic. Instead, I 
just want to look at how we, as 
a society, are approaching the 
topic of going green.
The often-talked-about but rare
ly followed doctrine of going green
 making environmentally sound 
decisions, daily  is more achiev
able than we make it out to be. 
Successfully going green is largely 
dictated by how successful we are 
in altering the ways we think about 
how we live. We have to want to 
protect the environment, because 
we need to protect it.
Going green does not have to 
have a super political undertone. 
Making environmentally friendly 
choices is not another issue to get 
debated, stuck, and lost in the 
political realm. The process real
ly happens on the streets, every 
day, in between classes and on 
the way to work. Its about using 
a refillable coffee cup instead 
of wasting two paper cups for 
every Americano you get from 
Starbucks. Its about walking or 
biking from your apartment on 
Fifth Avenue instead of hopping 
in your Honda. The concept of 
going green doesnt have to alien
ate anyone  nor should it. Im 
not asking everyone to quit his 
or her job and join me in a har
monious round of Kumbaya 
(although, if youre interested, 
Im free after 5 p.m.).
Nonetheless, it is imperative 
that the ideals of green practices 
are implemented in our society, 
and, perhaps most importantly, on 
a daily basis. Achieving this goal 
will require an appeal to our entire 
society that removes all conversa
tion about the environment from 
the typically liberal, left-handed 
side of the spectrum and places it 
in the hands of the masses.
But how can this be done? It is 
indeed a challenge to make the
concept of altering ones habits 
to protect the environment for 
future generations appealing to a 
public that sees tree-huggers as a 
hassle and Antarctica a distant, if 
not forgotten, reality.
In a Feb. 7 article in The 
New York Times titled In Many 
Communities, Its Not Easy Going 
Green, Mayor David N. Cicilline 
of Providence, R.I. was quoted as 
having said that energy efficiency 
requires a whole new infrastruc
ture to evaluate and measure the 
issues plaguing communities and 
stopping them from going green. 
He is right. However, just iden
tifying this problem and writing 
it off as something that horribly
Lizzee Solomon/Art Editor
and permanently inhibits energyuse evaluation and conservation 
is not okay. Instead of dismissing 
the idea of altering our ways of 
life to be more environmentally 
sensitive, we have to push past 
this issue and make the change 
in framework and mindset neces
sary to save the environment.
It is absolutely feasible. We can 
reduce our impact on the envi
ronment. We can drive five fewer 
miles per day by picking up art 
supplies in Squirrel Hill and shop
ping for groceries in Shadyside in 
one trip. We can carpool to work. 
We can let our hair air-dry instead 
of blowing it dry before class. 
Making moves to conserve just
that much more energy does 
not label us as 2-D tree-huggers 
or blindingly idealist liberals; 
but taking small steps toward 
preserving the earth does make 
us that much more thoughtful, 
put-together, and respectful of 
the spaces in which we live.
Ill admit that I am, of course, 
also at fault for falling into the 
trap of taking the so-called easy 
route. Last week, I replaced a 
burned-out bulb in my kitchen 
with a regular incandescent one 
rather than just waiting to pick 
up a compact fluorescent one 
on my next trip to Geagle. In 
doing so, I took a step back
ward: I used an incandescent 
bulb, which, aside from being 
common and regular, is really 
just outdated technology.
As such, choosing the regu
lar, more common option is not 
necessarily the easiest way of 
doing things. It is just as easy 
to stock up on compact fluorescents as incandescent bulbs. 
(The extra money expended up 
front is accounted for by the 
long life of the bulb.) Doing 
things the way we know how to 
feels comfortable and ensures 
us that were part of society, that 
were doing things the normal 
way. But being environmentally 
conscious no longer brands you 
as an outlier; rather, there is 
a move in our culture toward 
preserving the spaces in which 
we build our cities, build our 
schools, and build our lives. Its 
time that we embrace new tech
nologies, new means of living, 
and new ways of defining the 
spaces in which we live  as sus
tainable communities, respectful 
of the land on which we rest.

Hey Tartans,
First off, I know its a time when 
many have exams, so I hope all is 
going well with that. Were all a 
little stressed out right now, but 
thats no reason to stop having 
fun. Last weekends Lunar Gala 
was a big event on campus that 
saw a lot of student participation, 
and I want to congratulate the LG 
Board on their success over the 
past 12 years.
Speaking of events  with 
President Cohons help, Adi and 
I hosted the inaugural Presi
dents Dinner Forum on Friday. 
One hundred and thirty student, 
faculty, and staff leaders came 
together in the Posner Center for 
a few hours of discussion about 
Carnegie Mellons future. The 
gathering provoked thoughtful 
discussion among a large group 
of people with varying perspec
tives. The main question at the 
event was, based on the assump
tion that change is inevitable, 
how do we change, and how fast 
should that change occur?
The event proved to be very 
successful, and the university 
community will see how the sen
timents that were voiced on Fri
day take shape in the immediate 
future as well as in the years to 
come. Adi and I hope that the 
Presidents Dinner Forum con
tinues under the auspices of the 
universitys president and student 
body president, regardless of who 
fills those roles in the future.
This past week, Adi and I also 
sat down with Gloriana St. Clair, 
dean of University Libraries, to 
discuss the ever-improving situ
ation on campus in her depart
ment. We conveyed to her all of 
the positive feedback we have 
been getting throughout the year 
about the vast improvements 
made as a result of the CMU5 
and last years Student Senate 
Business Committees hard work. 
Thank you to everyone who has 
been kind enough to voice your 
opinions. We also conveyed 
our concern regarding a lack 
of paper-copying resources on 
campus, or at least those that, as 
students, we could charge to our 
printing quotas. As a result, stu
dent government will be joining 
St. Clair in financing several new 
scanners in the library, so we can 
all convert documents from hard 
to digital form and back again 
for an additional fee. Moreover, 
we will be testing the 24-hour li
brary proposal suggested by Co
lin Sternhell and Lauren Hudock 
during their campaign for the 
student body president and vicepresident offices. We havent yet 
chosen the week in which we 
will be hosting a 24-hour library, 
but we will let you know more on 
that as soon as we can.
As always, if you have any 
questions or comments, e-mail 
us at cmu5@cmu.edu.

I will argue that the issue 
between evolutionary theory and 
theology is not a conflict with 
Scripture or doctrine but whether we 
speak well of Nature. Speaking 
well of Nature (as opposed to 
speaking correctly) demands noticing 
that beautiful form underlies the very 
nature of Nature. Beautiful form then 
becomes the bridge where 
evolutionary theory and theology can 
find a common and mutually 
supportive ground.

Batch discusses importance of sports
MATTHEW E. CAMPBELL .

Football means different 
things to different people. For 
Carnegie Mellon students, the 
Super Bowl, for instance, was 
an opportunity to take a break 
from homework and have some 
fun. For families, football games 
mean time together on the couch 
for 16 weeks out of the year. For 
the residents of Homestead in 
the 1970s and 80s, the Steelers 
four Super Bowl titles gave them 
something to be proud of. The 
team helped keep peoples minds
off of the disintegration of the 
steel industry, which culminated 
with the closing of the Home
stead Works in 1984.
I never knew the impact it 
would have, said Homestead 
native and Steelers quarterback 
Charlie Batch at a lecture last 
Monday night. But as we got a 
little older, thats when people 
started to say, Yeah you need to 
figure out what you want to do 
because the days of dropping out 
of high school or going right from 
high school to the steel mills are 
over. But in our town, people re
ally kept their minds off it....
For Batch, football became the 
way out of the economic depres
sion and violence that engulfed 
Homestead, violence that would 
claim the life of his 17-year-old 
sister in the mid-1990s. At the 
time, Batch was at Eastern Mich
igan University; My major was 
football, and I minored in what
ever else, he said.
Batch, who was studying crim
inal justice, considered quitting 
school, but the thought that kept

NYU then continued its hot 
streak, with a 17-0 run to end 
the game, snatching the victory 
from the Tartans at 59-49. Aleski 
had a game-high 16 points, while 
three other Tartans scored in 
double figures; Roll cashed in 
with 11 and Innes and Feola each 
had 10.
Following their disappointing 
loss, the Tartans traveled to take 
on the Judges. They trailed 20-8 
at the 11:13 mark before rattling 
off five unanswered shots to pull 
within seven (20-13). Aleski cbnverted on an and-one and then 
dished the ball to Roll for the 
Tartans other score. Brandeis 
then answered the Tartans and 
turned nine Tartan turnovers in 
the first stanza into 14 points for 
the Judges as they took a 15-point 
lead, 43-28, into the break.
In the second half, Brandeis 
exploded on a 9-0 run, extend
ing its lead to 52-28.
The Judges held a 61-37 lead 
with 8:20 to play, but the Tartans 
persisted, as they went on a 9-0 
run of their own, closing to 61-46
with 7:03 on the clock. Aleski ac
counted for seven of the Tartans 
nine points on their run.
Carnegie Mellon continued 
to chip into the Brandeis lead, 
but sophomore Jessica Chapins 
three-pointer with 2:20 to play 
unfortunately sealed a 69-60 
victory for the Judges.
The Tartans were led by Aleskis season-high 19 points and 
Rolls second double-double of 
the season with 17 points and 10 
rebounds.
Despite the losses, Sain and 
Schilling remained proud of their 
team.
Every coach we play against 
comments on how hard our kids 
play every minute of every game, 
Sain said. You cant ask for more 
from our players in terms of game 
time effort.

family out of the situation. 
Batch played hard and in 1998 
was drafted by the Detroit Lions, 
where he started from 1998 to 
2001. In 2002, Batch returned 
to Pittsburgh as the Steelers 
backup quarterback, a position 
he continues to hold today.
- As a member of Steelers squad 
that won the franchises fifth 
Supfer Bowl, Batch returned to 
Homestead a hero. He described 
a parade through Pittsburgh, 
telling the audience he could 
not imagine anything other than 
football inspiring 250,000 people 
tjo celebrate a single event.
. When he returned to Pittsbuigh from Detroit, Batch set up 
tHe Best of the Batch foundation, 
which centers on a summer bas
ketball league. The league, now 
in its seventh year, started with 
125 kids and 25 volunteers, and
has grown to 300 kids and 80 
volunteers.
Batchs goal in his foundation 
is not just to go to a middle school 
and throw" a couple passes to kids 
who cant catch. On the contrary, 
he is very visible in the league 
and is there frequently in the 
summertime. They need people 
in their lives they can trust  
bottom line, he said.
Over the summer, Batch is in
terested in keeping Homestead 
kids off the streets. He found that 
a football league was less ideal 
than one for basketball, which 
fills up the time immediately 
after school ends until football 
camp later in the summer.
The only thing theyll want 
to do when they go home is go 
to sleep, said Batch, who wears 
kids out during the practices.
At the lecture, one audience 
member criticized Batch for pre
senting a career as a professional
athlete as the path to success, 
as becoming a professional ath
lete is extremely difficult. Batch 
agreed, and hes not necessarily 
trying to inspire the next Michael 
Jordan.
Sports and education go hand 
in hand, Batch said. Best of the 
Batch requires a 2.2 GPA to play, 
and hell check up on the kids 
grades, not just in the semester 
before basketball but throughout 
the entire year.
If youre a grade schooler in 
Homestead and youre not do
ing your homework, youre liable 
to get a visit from Batch. Part of 
Batchs emphasis on education 
probably comes from his mother, 
who made him go to summer 
school in sixth grade at the ex
pense of football.
Batch also feels that sports 
equip kids with skills theyll use 
throughout life, even if they dont 
become professional athletes. I
think [playing a sport] gives them 
something to do with their time
 staying competitive, learning 
how to be productive with a team 
and be part of a team, he said. I 
think [having these skills] helps 
you in the work force too.
Batch feels his program has 
been successful. He felt particu
larly pleased when the Home
stead police told him they dont 
even bother patrolling when 
basketball is in session. He takes 
pride in the fact that theres only 
ever been one fight in his league, 
and that was between two girls 
fighting over who they were go
ing with, he said.
While football was the only 
choice for Batch in the early 
1990s, hes helping to educate 
kids in Homestead and expand 
their opportunities. Remember, 
at some point, somebody helped 
you. We didnt do it alone.

Basketball defeats New York University away
CASEY TAYLOR
Staffwriter
Carnegie Mellon had the mo
mentum going into the Brandeis 
game after coming off a strong, 
43-point half to defeat New York 
University Friday night. The Tar
tans fell three points short of a 
promising weekend on Sunday, 
losing to Brandeis 84-81. Sunday 
saw one of Greg Gonzalezs big
gest performances of the season, 
as the team scored 21 points and 
pulled down 14 rebounds.
Junior Terrance Bouldin-John
son also tied a career high with 
nine rebounds. Despite winning 
the rebounding war, the Tartans 
could not outscore the Judges on 
Brandeis home court.
Gonzalez, who had his second 
straight double-double in the 
game, gave Carnegie Mellon a 
one-point lead with five minutes 
left to play after four straight 
foul shots. On the Judges next 
possession, they connected on a 
fadeaway jumper with 4:44 left, 
regaining the lead and holding on 
for good.
We just couldnt get over 
the hump, said guard Corey 
ORourke, who finished with 13 
points. Once they took the lead, 
we just let them get another big 
lead. We couldnt buckle down 
and get stops. We made a little 
push at the end, but it was too 
little, too late.
Too little, too late: This has 
been the story for the Tartans this 
season, cashing in on a few key 
opportunities but falling short of 
anything substantial when the 
opportunity arises. The team saw 
it happen last weekend when the 
players dropped two games on the 
road, the UAA title in the balance.
They dropped two close games at 
home to Brandeis and NYU, which 
could have easily kept them in the 
league until the end.
We have to keep it together, 
said Bouldin-Johnson, who had 
a career-high five blocked shots 
in Sundays game. We played 
a tough schedule this year. We 
have to handle our business these 
last few games and hope that our 
schedule can earn us a postseason 
bid.
A postseason bid is likely for the 
Tartans; however, an NCAA bid is 
probably a long shot. At this point, 
the best record they can hope for 
is 17-8, which will fall short of the 
20-win plateau that usually guar
antees a bid. Carnegie Mellon may 
have some impressive wins on its 
resume, but their losses will prob
ably work against them.
NYU at home was huge, said 
junior forward Jon Wolleben of 
the at-home loss. You can justify 
dropping games to Chicago or 
Washington, but NYU was one we 
shouldve taken care of.
The Tartans got their revenge 
on the Violets Friday night. Big 
games from Ryan Einwag and 
Jack Anderson propelled Carn
egie Mellon ahead in the second 
half for a comfortable eight-point 
victory. Anderson connected on 
four three-point shots, adding 
three more free throws for a total 
of 15 points. Einwag was a perfect
6 for 6 from the free-throw line 
and finished up with 18 points.
Carnegie Mellon returns home 
this weekend to face off against 
Case Western Reserve and Emory. 
The team hopes to get two wins, 
thereby gaining some momentum 
for its final showdown with sixthranked University of Rochester at 
home.Senior Geoff Kozak (#3) goes up for a rebound in the game against NYU.

The Carnegie Mellon womens 
basketball team capped off a 
disappointing week of University 
Athletic Association (UAA) action 
with losses to the New York 
University Violets Friday and the 
Brandeis University Judges Sun
day last week. The losses dropped 
the Tartans record to 7-15 overall 
and 0-11 in UAA play.
Right now we are working to 
improve our shooting percent
age and transition defense, said 
junior guard Jeanette Schilling 
before the game. Our practices 
have been focused on perfecting 
our offensive execution and de
fending key players. We hope to 
have a good showing in New York 
and Boston.
Assistant coach Carissa Sain 
added, Shooting percentage is 
the great equalizer in the game 
of basketball  all other prepara
tion is irrelevant if you cant score 
in games.
The Tartans intense prepara
tion seemed to have paid off as 
they sprinted out of their recent 
shooting slump early in the game, 
hitting six of their first eight shots 
and five of their first six threepointers on their way to an im
pressive 17-8 lead with just above 
12 minutes left in the first half.
Juniors Corey Innes and Stacie 
Aleski each had two three-pointers early in the game.
A three-pointer by junior for
ward Rachelle Roll gave them the 
largest lead of the game, with a 
score of 38-20 at the half. Aleski 
led all scorers during the first 20 
minutes of play with 13 points 
and a perfect 5 for 5 from the field 
and 3 for 3 from downtown. Innes 
and Roll each had eight at the 
break, while Feola cashed in with 
seven and led all players with 
seven boards. The Tartans shot 58 
percent from the field in the first 
half, but more importantly shot 
64 percent (seven for 11) from be
hind the arc. NYU was 24 percent 
from the field and only made one 
three-pointer.
After Feola made the first bas
ket of the second half, giving the 
Tartans a 40-20 lead, the Violets 
arose from their slump, as they 
went on a 20-1 run to pull within 
one point at 41-40 with 9:31 to 
play. Each team exchanged bas
kets and then the Tartans scored 
six unanswered points to push 
their lead to seven with 6:58 
showing on the clock. Following 
a NYU timeout, however, the Vio
lets answered Carnegie Mellon 
with eight straight points of their 
own, to take their first lead of the

Full Name:
Donna Morosky
University Job Title:
Director ofFitness
Kristen Severson/Photo Staff ,
SARA WINGEN
Junior Staffwriter
Director of Fitness Donna 
Morosky is making huge strides 
in improving the fitness envi
ronment at Carnegie Mellon. 
Along with developing the ex
ercise programs and workout 
classes, Morosky teaches aero
bic fitness and spinning classes 
this semester. With plans for 
even more improvements to 
exercise facilities and classes, 
Morosky answered some of 
our questions about the future 
of fitness on campus.
The Tartan: What made 
you decide to come to work at 
Carnegie Mellon?
Morosky: When the op
portunity to interview for the 
swimming coach position was 
made known to me, I was not 
even looking for another job. I 
think the underlying factor in 
my decision was the challenge 
to improve the team and to be 
competitive in Division III.
T: What is a typical day in 
the life of Donna?
M: Each day brings on its 
own challenges from teaching 
class, which I love, attending 
meetings, developing and im
plementing programs in the 
area of wellness, reviewing 
group exercise instructors in 
their classes, and maintaining 
workable fitness equipment. 
I work closely with Pattye 
Stragar and Mike Mastroianni 
almost every day. Were al
ways looking for ways to 
improve our programs as de
mand grows or diminishies in 
physical education and group 
exercises.
T: Have you seen changes 
in athletic awareness on cam
pus?
M: As we all know, Carnegie 
Mellon is a highly competi
tive school both academically 
and athletically. Our teams 
continue to receive more and 
more recognition in the UAA 
and nationally.
Special programs with guest 
speakers like Charlie Batch, 
and events such as the cancer 
awareness events by the bas
ketball teams help a lot. The 
Senior Olympics held in 2006 
on campus certainly helped to 
increase athletic awareness.
All of the new additions to 
the staff under the direction 
of our director, Susan Bassett, 
and her vision of an academi
cally and athletically elite uni
versity [have] improved the 
awareness of athletics in a 
very short time.
T: What has the UC done 
over the past few years to help 
combat non-athletic behav
ior?
M: As we move forward to 
a new facility, one key goal of 
the athletic department is to 
grow the quality and quantity
of the services we provide. We 
currently use a replacement 
system of every three years 
with the cardio equipment 
in the UC and in Skibo. This 
spring well replace the cardio 
equipment.
T: Do you have any special 
plans in the works?
M: New this year has been 
the development of an intefn 
program with the University 
or Pittsburgh [department ofj 
health and physical activity;
Majors in this department 
attend here for one semester 
so that we then have an ad
ditional person to implement 
new programs and help staff 
with current ones. New For 
this term are the one-on-one 
personal training sessions and 
some group training. We are 
hoping that this collaboration 
will continue.
T: Whats your favorite 
part about being a part of the 
Carnegie Mellon community?
M: I truly enjoy this campus 
community, mostly because 
of the professionalism here, 
all of the friends I have now 
over the 30+ years that Ive 
been here, and being able to 
work alongside many highly 
educated and diverse mem
bers both in and out of my 
department.
T: Any words of wisdom to 
students on staying active?
M: If I could get just one 
message out to the student 
body, it would be to stay active 
and maintain proper nutrition. 
Physical activity and nutri
tion helps not only to balance 
the stress of academics, but 
also provides fuel to get the 
job done, mental clarity, and 
allows one to sleep and rest 
when needed.
T: What is your favorite 
sport to play? To watch?
M: During the winter, al
though I ski when I get the 
chance, I spend most of my 
sports time playing platform 
or paddle tennis and attending 
yoga classes. In the summer 
I play tennis, swim, and con
tinue with most of my yoga 
classes. Sporting events that I 
watch include football, basket
ball, and swimming.
T: Does Carnegie Mellon 
seem like a healthy campus 
in your opinion?
M: The campus community 
continues to be more and more 
aware of healthy lifestyles and 
habits.
It starts from the leadership 
of [President] Cohon through 
departments working together 
such as the athletics, student 
health, Environmental Health 
and Safety, and Housing to 
achieve better understanding 
of health in general, green 
environments, and fitness 
awareness.

Landscapes of the soul
SoulScapes closes at August Wilson CenterEverything you need to know
About loneliness and brain lust
SoulScapes, a unique exhibition that showcased the 
work of talented African American women, came to 
a close on Saturday, Feb. 16. Presented by Women of 
Visions, Inc., the exhibition was held at the August 
Wilson Center for African American Culture and 
was co-curated by. Cecile Shellman, a specialist in 
aqueous media, and Marica Jackson, a ceramic artist 
and the president of Women of Visions, Inc.
[Women of Visions, Inc.] was brought about because 
there was no place for African-American artists to 
exhibit their work, said Joyce Baucum, a member 
of Women of Visions, Inc. and an employee at the 
August Wilson Center. "And so [the founders] 
decided to get together in a group and have their 
own shows and rent different venues. [We wanted] to 
show folks who said that we could not do it that its 
being done, and its being done well.
The exhibit showcased the work of 18 different 
artists, all of whom are members of Women of 
Visions, Inc. The organization was started in 1981 
and is celebrating its 27th birthday this year.
Baucum's contribution to the exhibition was a 
collection of beautiful silver gelatin photographs, 
each capturing a special moment in time.
We sat down and went through brainstorming 
sessions, and I think we went from talking about 
landscapes and hoyv they represent whats on 
the outside of you to SoulScapes [and how they] 
represent whats on the inside of you, Baucum said. *
The exhibits artwork offered a diverse array of 
perspectives and media. The pieces ranged from 
artistic ceramics, fiber, collage, .and mixed media 
works, to vibrant oil, acrylic, and watercolor 
paintings, along with several computer-generated 
and silver gelatin photographs. Each display had 
its own message, evoking different feelings in the 
viewer.
The first piece on display was a beautifully worked 
blue structure created by Charlotte Ka. Entitled Go 
Cry Girl, Girl Go Cry!, this piece was an encaustic 
on a wooden panel, meaning that it was made 
entirely out of wax. The structure was inspired by an 
opera about an enslaved woman who would rather 
sacrifice her children than allow them to be enslaved 
as well. It was mounted by the figure of a womans 
face with a jeweled teardrop sliding down her cheek.
Both curators had their work on display at the 
exhibition. Jackson created a ceramic statue of a 
woman, inspired by a poem that was adapted from 
an old Viking battle prayer. This statue is the first 
in her "Beloved series, a series about women who 
celebrate life and are prepared for the hereafter. 
Shellman had two intriguing watercolor paintings on 
display entitled "First, Man and First, Woman.
The exhibit also contained quilts made of colorful 
pieces of fabric and hand-embroidered designs.
Many had vibrant beads stitched onto them, tracing 
symbols and patterns.
One of the most interesting pieces in the exhibit
featured fiber on canvas. Entitled "Inside and 
Out: Self Portrait, the piece depicted the face of 
a woman whose features were outlined by beads 
and threads of various colors and textures. The 
artist, Mayota Hill, also created a piece called Soul 
Engine #9, which, through its fusion of beads 
and colorful fabric, ihreads, and cogwheels from 
clocks, seemed to be whirring and coming to life, 
pulsating like the actual soul.
Another very interesting piece was an acrylic 
painting by Delores Currin called Meditation." The 
painting depicted a woman, her eyes half closed 
and smiling, sitting outside at a table and warming 
her hands on a cup of coffee. The artist intended 
this image to represent that perfect moment in 
a womans day when her worries have not yet 
begun and she has the time to enjoy her first cup 
of coffee.
I think a lot of people can connect to, not just this 
painting, but a lot of the work here, said Treshea 
Wade, manager of communications for the August 
Wilson Center.
The exhibition also contained a number of collages, 
each sending its own unique message. One by 
Laverne Kemp, entitled "Soul shapers, the women 
who raised me, is an amalgamation of pictures 
of loved ones and letters addressed to them, 
assembled with obvious love and care. Another 
collage, "Souls of Men by Mary Martin, aimed to 
spread awareness about the high number of deaths 
among African-American youth. Pictures of the 
deceased were layered over cutouts of newspaper 
reports, creating a simultaneously moving and 
chilling piece of art.
There were also some powerful paintings, 
each showcasing part of the identity of 
African-American women. "My soul be drowned 
in this ocean, a painting by Harriette Meriwether, 
was inspired by the painful journey of African 
women forced to leave home and come to America. 
It centered on the continent of Africa, surrounded 
by a swirling sea of brilliant blue and green, 
and has a touching message written in a spiral. 
Adrienne Powers' painting "Soul Sista depicted 
the strong image of the African-American woman 
back in the '60s, when she began to forge her own 
identity.
The exhibit contained amazing works of art, each 
laying bare a piece of the artists soul. The talent, 
hard work, and emotion behind each artists 
contribution were evident in every piece. Each 
work was unique in its own way, either through 
the materials they used or the message they 
conveyed. As a whole, the exhibition certainly 
exemplified its title, presenting many examples of 
SoulScapes.

Dear Rachael,
I have a problem. As of todays 
date, I have never had a real 
girlfriend. You know, someone 
who I actually took places and we 
would hold hands, mushy stuff 
like that. And now, Im feeling 
a little overwhelmed seeing a 
lot of my friends in committed 
relationships. Is this normal? 
Is it okay that Im 19 and have 
never had a real girlfriend? What 
can I do to rid myself of that fear 
of being alone forever, never 
knowing the loving embrace of 
someone who at the very least 
can tolerate me? Help!
Scared and Dateless
My Dateless Darling,
It sounds lame, but everything 
happens for a reason. It may seem 
like there are oh-so-many people 
with significant others, frolicking 
all over campus, grossing out the 
typical passerby (myself included, 
of course). But that doesnt mean 
everyone is kickin it with someone 
special. Youre in college now, and 
I think the most important part of 
college is learning about yourself. 
Get to know you before you get 
to know a girl; it will make your life 
loads easier. Youll be able to know 
what you want and what you don't, 
what turns you off and what gets 
you... excited. Life is too short  
and if the right girl is around, you 
two will find each other.
Regarding your all-encompassing 
fear of loneliness that lasts forever, 
don't worry. Things tend to work 
themselves out. For all I know, 
you could have a hot girl reading 
this right now, intrigued by your 
sensitivity and concern. She might 
want to jump your bones! And 
lastly, dont worry about someones 
ability to tolerate you; I know a lot of 
ridiculous people, and theres always 
at least 18 people whose ability to 
tolerate exceeds my own.
Besides, at least  in the eternal 
words of Clueless  you arent a 
virgin who cant drive. Or are you?
I know a few that I could hook you 
upwith....
Dont fret, pet!
Rachael
Dear Rachael,
I have a crush on one of my 
professors. Well, Im not really 
sure if its him or its his brain 
that Im attracted to. All I do 
during lecture is think about 
going to office hours for some, 
uh, one-on-one tutelage. Im also 
in a long distance relationship, 
but I cant seem to help myself. 
How can ) stop lusting after this 
knowledge provider and start 
studying my notes again?
Lusty Cerebral Fiend
Oh Lusty one,
Ah, the eternal professor-student life 
triangle. Well, less like a triangle and 
more like two parallel lines. Typically,
I think professors should not be off 
limits if: a) they are not really old, b) 
they are not married, or c) you dont 
have a significant other. Oh wait, you 
do. Cheater! But, you are a cheater 
in the most respectable way. Ive 
never heard of jealousy over a mental 
affair, so why dont you go at it? 
Talk to him, exchange knowledge, 
tell him about things that younger 
people know (unless hes too old, 
which is a disqualification under item 
a). Ask him for some one-on-one 
tutoring! He can tutor you! Then if 
your long-away boyfriend asks, just 
tell him the truth: You were lusting 
for knowledge. Just try to not take 
the mans pants off  that would be 
inappropriate.
Hail to the cerebellum!

No more reruns
The writers strike has ended
Courtesy of Eddie Wong Courtesy of Eddie Wong
Wait a minute  words in the prompter, script on my desk, 
vending machine upstairs outof Funyuns?...The writers are 
back!"
So began the Wednesdays episode of The Daily Show with 
Jon Stewart. The occasion? The end of the 14-week strike 
by the Writers Guild of America (WGA), which shut down 
the production of scripted television from Hollywood to New 
York. It doesnt matter if youre a fan of Grey's Anatomy or 
The Colbert Report, Numb3rs or even the Golden Globes
 chances are your TV-watching habits have been altered 
in one way or another by the three-month-long strike. The 
writers strike is estimated to have cost the industry over $2 
billion in L.A. alone, also hampering businesses that rely on 
television productions to survive, like limousine, catering, and 
hotel companies, according to a report from the Los Angeles 
Economic Development Corp.
The WGA East and West began their strike on Nov. 5 when 
the union and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television 
Producers (AMPTP) disagreed over the terms of their new 
contract. While not all of their demands have been met, 
the most important items were agreed upon, and the new 
contract is generally considered to have been the best that 
could be hoped for. Primary concerns*that were met were an 
increase in the amount of earnings the writers get from the 
sale of DVDs (doubled from 3 percent to 6 percent), and a 
percentage of profits gained from Internet media and content, 
a new market whose profitability is unclear. The writers' 
union and the heads of major television companies remained 
at a standoff for three months before working out a tentative 
contract that satisfied both groups needs. Though the board 
of the WGA had unanimously voted to accept the AMPTPs 
offer over the weekend, the strike was not officially called 
off until last Tuesday, when the members of the WGA East 
and West voted to stop the strike by a 92.5 percent margin. 
Writers were allowed to go back to work on Wednesday (or, if 
they really wanted, Tuesday night), and production has begun 
on many once-quiet television sets.
Chances are that you're getting a bit tired of those trashy 
(but addicting) reality TV shows like American Idol, Rock of 
Love II with Bret Michaels, and Moment of Truth. So, now 
that the writers are getting the money they deserve, the most 
important question arises: When will new episodes come out? 
With only three and a half months left in the season, networks 
have been making critical decisions on how to make the most 
of that time.
Late-Night talk shows like The Colbert Report and Late Night 
with Conan O'Brien have already gotten their writers back, 
much to their hosts relief. Next to come back will be the 
half-hour sitcoms in the beginning of April, as they are the 
easiest to produce. Networks are also pushing for the biggest 
money-makers, such as Grey's Anatomy and Gossip Girl to 
come out with several new episodes, while serialized dramas 
have unfortunately been pushed back until next year. Lastly, 
the fates of many freshman series are fairly uncertain. Those 
that did badly before the strike, such as Bionic Woman and 
Cavemen, got axed before they could waste any more airtime.
The writers may be back, but Hollywood still needs time to 
produce their shows. Happy TV watching!

Mana Ameri (left) and Kristen Chou (right) display 
their fashion choices for the changing seasons.
The signs that warm, sunny weather is right around the 
corner are beginning to show, as spring fashion elements 
are popping up right after the season's biggest snowstorm. 
Despite the fact that melting ice and snow cover campus, CIT 
first-year Mana Ameri and H&SS first-year Kristen Chou are 
already dressing for spring, hopeful for warmer days to come.
Chou captures her style with excellent combinations of color 
and textures while still keeping warm. To add insulation to 
her bright yellow skirt and white flats, she uses another great 
winter accessory  her scarf. Textured tights and a toggle 
coat tie the look together, creating a seamless transition 
from winter into spring. Tights have many functions; they 
make legs look longer and leaner, and are a modern,, toasty 
substitute for bare legs. Adding tights to an outfit can 
instantly pull it together. Ordinarily, winter is a season for 
dressing dark, monotone, and easy. However, Chou's use 
of bold colors and modern winfer basics look great without 
sacrificing necessities.
Ameri's look is often seen around campus this time of 
year, but the integration of different textures and patterns 
make her outfit unique. Her fitted red plaid bomber jacket 
is eye-catching, and the shearling (sheepskin or lambskin) 
collar adds warmth without sacrificing style. Underneath the 
jacket is a contemporary sweatshirt with gold buttons; adding 
small, quirky details will never go unnoticed. Fitted jeans 
appropriately tucked into flat, comfortable boots keep the 
outfit practical for toughing out a very wet campus. At this 
time of year, thick socks with boots are essential to keeping 
feet warm and dry; its also a classic style that will never 
become obsolete. Ameri manages to capture the essentials

modern elements for the transition from winter to spring.
of comfortable winter wear while still adding subtle personal 
touches to keep her outfit interesting and personalized.
While dressing well tends to fall to the female half of campus, 
not all men are devoid of fashion sense. CFA sophomore Drew 
Lightfoot reflects his creativity in his style. He combines 
different elements of classic and youthful styles without 
having them clash. The colors of his outfit remain, for the 
most part, neutral: brown blazer, forest-green sweater, black 
slacks. But his neckline is the most incredible part of the 
outfit, with a bright baby-blue collared shirt and a fun printed 
tie. Creating contrast like Lightfoots is.an elegant way to 
incorporate the summery, bolder pieces of a mans wardrobe 
into a more conservative, classic backdrop.'
Lightfoots use of texture also adds to his originality. The 
grungy fitted corduroy blazer, paired with a sleek sweater, 
classic woven shirt, and silk tie, hints at a modern, edgier 
take of a tried and true look. Though Lightfoots style sounds 
hard to imitate, there are a few key points to consider when 
dressing for winter. To start, a fitted jacket is essential; 
afterward, be sure to layer smooth, basic pieces underneath. 
Even though Lightfoot is wearing three layers, it does not 
hide his silhouette. Most importantly, try to make use out of all 
your clothes, year-round.
Sometimes it works; sometimes it doesnt. But with practice 
and creativity, great, distinctive style will evehtually come 
naturally.

* 'f 4'-M'M.  f  'A >  * * yi f *A night of synthpop at Pegasus
Freezepop performs in Pittsburgh
-i____  *. i '  < r i < .
With keytars, electric viola, electric drum pad in tow, 
Freezepops Saturday concert couldnt have been 
anything other than a study in synthetic fun. The small 
club was packed with a young crowd, many of whom 
made an interesting addition t<? the synthpop theme 
with their Pegasus-standard pleather jumpsuits and 
fairy costumes.
Local opener Pfunkt (Alex Burkat, a DJ at University of 
Pittsburgh) started off the show with a set that sounded 
a lot like the Beastie Boys spliced with the amazing 
cheesiness of SNL parody songs. Happily, lyrics like 
"ain't no past participles/1 want that a$$ pronto/ rollin' 
with my honeys / ridin' in my Dodge Durango.and 
numerous others worked with a backdrop of Chuck 
Norris rock-climbing videos and slides proclaiming 
SEXERCISE! Burkat also showed some spirit by 
jumping into the crowd.
Boy in Static, who is on the road with Freezepop, was 
touring with only two members of the larger, six-person 
band. The electric, synthesized sound from the bands 
albums did not translate well into the live performance, 
which was more like pop-rock. Still, Boy in Statics lyrics 
define the band's style, building elaborate and creative 
stories based on their wild and crazy experiences.
The band was a perfect opener for Freezepop, serving 
as a toned-down version of the electronic sounds 
and effects to come. The groups energy pervaded 
the music, making the performance fun and lively.
One distraction was the potentially dynamic electric 
viola, which, used for short staccato and abbreviated 
harmonies like it was, came off as little more than a 
synth.
Freezepop put on crowd-pleasing set, despite the fact 
that the band was one man down: Kasson Crooker 
(a.k.a. the Duke.) was back in the bands hometown 
of Boston, with hints that hes working on a new video 
game sequel  Crooker has worked on a number of 
PlayStation 2 games, and often includes Freezepops 
music in the soundtracks. The bands other two 
curiously named members, Liz Enthusiasm and 
Sean Drinkwater, held down the fort along with two 
substitute members, Crme Brule and Seth DamascusKennedy.
The Freezepop scene was reflective of the group's 
hectic style, as rowdy, beat-bopping teens and adults 
alike grooved to the sounds of the keytar. Band 
members jumped into the masses of sweating jivers, 
encouraging the crowd to get crazy. Heads banged, 
people "rocked, and flashing lights turned the scene 
into quite the psychedelic night.
 Freezepop's sound is a satisfying and dancy mix of 
'80s pop and more modern electronic sounds. On their 
My Space page, the band styles their sound as, kinda 
like kraftwerk/ meets ladytron/ who dates abba/ who 
spoons with.takako minekawa/ whose parents are the 
human league. And that's pretty apt.
Even when Liz Enthusiasm said that they were going to 
slow it down", Freezepop's slower, more serious songs 
came off the same as all the others, which was fine, 
considering the atmosphere at Pegasus. One long-time 
fan, while sidling off the packed dance floor, condensed 
the concert nicely: "Freezepop shows are always crazy.
The crowd waited patiently for the band's Guitar Hero 
hit, "Less Talk, More Rokk and was not disappointed. In 
addition to Guitar Hero 1 and 2, Freezepop has worked 
on the games FreQuency, Amplitude, Anti:Grav, and 
now Phase and RockBand. They are at the forefront of 
an interesting niche: electronic, virtual-performance 
pop/rock.
Pegasus did an excellent job with the show. The lighting 
was well done, especially for Freezepops set, and  
some of the best parts of the show were the filler music 
between sets, when.Pegasus pumped out more clubby 
toe-tappers.

On music blogs and websites
Disquiet (www.disquiet.com)
Disquiet is an excellent blog devoted to ambient and electronic music, 
as well as the artists behind the sound. Its a; great site to visit for 
free MP3s from netlabels, record labels who release their music on 
the Internet. The site is run by Marc Weidenbaum, who writes quite 
well and devotes equal attention to well known musicians such as 
Brian Eno and lesser known ones such as Polina Voronova, a Russian 
ambient artist who many discovered purely through Disquiet.
WFMUs Beware of the Blog {blog.wfmu.org)
WFMU is one of the countrys best freeform radio stations; it is also the 
oldest. The stations blog is updated often and contains some of the 
weirdest music-related stuff youll find on the Internet; MP3 downloads 
of super-rare recordings, as well as various obscure remixes and 
releases from a variety of genres. For example, one recent entry was 
an MP3 showdown between two different bands that released albums 
imitating Beatles material.
The Hype Machine (www.hypem.com)
The Hype Machine isnt really a blog; it scans many other music blogs 
and presents links to their songs in a nicely organized fashion. On 
top of that, the site allows users to listen via an in-browser player, no 
download required. The Hype Machine is the pulse of the Internets 
electro-mashup-dance-remix obsession  just click on the link 
labeled popular" at the top of the page, and the site will treat you to 
a sampling of what every hipster has on repeat as they update their 
MySpace.
RCRD LBL (www.rcrdlbl.com)
RCRD LBL is a relative newcomer to the MP3 blog scene, but its 
quickly established itself as favorite for many a surfer. One of the 
reasons for this is the sites close connections to a lot of excellent 
labels (as the name might suggest). A variety of labels contribute music 
to RCRD LBL, making it a great place to find lots of high quality music. 
The site provides a genre of music more rock than Disquiet, less dance 
that Hype Machine, and less obscure than WFMUs Blog.
UbuWeb (www.ubu.com)
UbuWeb is different from all of the above in that it covers a lot more 
than just music. The site is a collection of all sorts of experimental art, 
music, writing, and poetry. It's definitely worth a visit, as it contains 
some amazing archived recordings of famous experimental pieces 
alongside more contemporary sound thats unlike anything most other 
websites have to offer. UbuWeb has a section called 365 Days Project, 
where a new MP3 is posted every day along with a short description.

Lunar Gala: Reduce, reuse, recycle
Student and corporate designers display conceptual fashions

.D..I..Q.O.
pillbOX 02.18.08
Clothing from the South Side boutique Original Cin elicited 
a burst of applause for the sassy models that catwalked in 
jumpers and minidresses. Sporting a scarlet afro, one model 
dominated the runway with her audacious posing.
Throughout design major Diana Hurd's "Tab-leux," cutout 
faces crept onto the corners of hoop skirts, sweatshirtsand 
shirt dresses  details that reflect the title, which means 
paintings" in French. The garments exquisitely invoked 
hip-hops oversized outerwear, hip-hugging denim, and 
silk-screened, graffiti-inspired graphics.
With remarkable precision and structural attention, 
architecture first-year Alexandra Legrady and second-year 
architecture major Katherine Chin showcased "Metal 
Morphosis. Their section contained dresses made of 
horizontal metal strips connected by vertical wires. "Metal 
Morphosis resonated with cohesiveness and saluted the 
Santa Monica firm of the same name, mOrphosis, committed 
to the architectural expression of reconstruction.
Karma can take many forms. It can be a $50 bill on the 
sidewalk, a betrayal from a friend, a strangers unsolicited act 
of kindness, or even a thigh-skimming skirt constructed solely 
of balled-up bags from Target.
The theme for 2008s Lunar Gala fashion show, Karma, 
provided the backdrop for the runway celebration of the' 
Chinese New Year. Last fall, an executive board headed by 
Joshua Cummings selected 12 submissions from among 
Carnegie Mellon students for inclusion in Feb. 16s lineup.
Perhaps to mount suspense before the first sections debut, 
a child initiated Saturday's performance with a classical 
Chinese dance, which was followed by a video sequence 
showcasing the whimsical and witch-like Karma emblem 
before the lights fell, the chatter subsided, and the stage lit 
up.
The first sights of the show were stunning woodsy tones 
prevailing in senior design major Katie Rodgers "Terra 
Bonita." This series featured dresses alive with leafy layers, 
sparkling accents, and a display of vivid detail that linked last 
seasons metallics with spring's girlish bright colors. Each 
garment was feminine and intricate, and the empire waist 
reappeared throughout the collection.
L.A.-based retailer American Apparel sent outfits down the 
runway that failed to distinguish themselves from those on 
the mannequins that pose urbanely in the storefront windows. 
Variations on aerobic wear transformed the runway to a scene 
belonging in any corridor of a university building. There 
were the typical henley-under-vest and hoodie-over-T-shirt 
combinations and the post-disco leggings-plus-leotard getup. 
Finishing off the High School Musical track teams threads 
were American Apparels outrageous silver tights.

Suggestive and revealing, junior design major Angela Huang's 
"Reincarnation" took pleather to sadomasochistic extremes. 
The segment featured an outlandish parade, complete 
with balloons and a steamy kiss between two models. 
However timely Reincarnation" was in its representation of 
Valentine-colored plush fabrics and heart graphics, no amount 
of kissing could redeem the gaudiness rampant in this 
rendition of the theme.

from "Reincarnation" shows different possible spirit transformations of the human soul in the afterlife.
Toward the shows finale, the audience delighted in watching 
Carnegie Mellons less-modest members of the student body 
strip down to their skivvies for Victoria Secrets section.
Also using abs to his advantage was Joseph Orlando, whose 
urbane menswear hung from the chiseled shoulders of suavely 
strutting, partially clothed models.
Not every collection channeled so much sexual energy. From 
Pleasantville to Pittsburgh came senior Victoria Spindel's 
Just Desserts, a walking prom catalogue of eveningwear 
gowns and skirts.
The show by sophomore design students Vanessa Koch 
and Margaret Gerhart was designed especially cleverly in 
conjunction with this years theme. Using found materials 
such as cardboard, paper bags, and garbage itself, Let's Get 
Trashed" conveyed playfulness rivaling British couture-maker 
Luella Bartley with parasols, baby-doll dresses, and paperboy 
outfits.
Meticulous attention to cut, form, fabric choice, and 
presentation characterized 2008's Lunar Gala, an 
overwhelmingly current exhibition of conceptual and 
contemporary fashion design.

Do it yourself
How to make homemade candles
Candles are a favorite room accent for many people. They are 
used to add ambiance to a room, to provide a fresh or warm 
scent, or even just as decoration. However, candles can be 
expensive, and making wax candles like those sold in stores 
takes a lot of time, energy, and effort. '
As long as you're not worried about how perfect yours is going 
to be, you can make your very own wax candles. And once 
youve got the hang of it, feel free to experiment with colors, 
fragrances, and molds to make a unique and fun collection.
Waxes come in a variety of different forms. There are animal 
waxes, such as beeswax and lanolin, vegetable waxes, such as 
soy wax, and mineral, petroleum, and synthetic waxes. Wicks 
also come in many different types. Some burn slower, some 
have less "sooting" (when soot gets on other objects around the 
candle or on the glass that the candle is in), and others do not 
drip wax while lit.
Fortunately, you can pretty much ignore most of this if you 
just looking for a simple, no-hassle, imperfect candle.
are
To make a wick, get a string, approximately 1/16 to 1/8 of an 
inch thick. Dip the string into a little candle wax and let the 
wax solidify. When placing the wick in a candle, you may have 
to hold it upright so that it does not fall to the side while the 
wax solidifies around the wick.
The traditional method of making wax candles is easy and
enjoyable. It involves a pot of liquid wax, a stick, and a string 
for the wick. The stick should be about nine inches long and 
should also be sturdy enough to support the weight of the 
candle on the end of it.
To begin, attach the string to the end of the stick. Then 
repeatedly dip the string into the pot of liquid wax at intervals 
of about one minute. When the layer of wax is large enough, 
you can use the candle as is or use a knife to shave and trim 
the wax into a different shape.
An even easier way to make wax candles is to take remnant 
candle wax from old candles and put it-into a metal baking 
tin. Its probably a good idea to buy a tin specifically for candle 
making or purchase a disposable aluminum baking tin, as the 
residual wax will never come out. Place the tin in the oven at 
350F until the wax is completely melted. Take the tin out of 
the oven and let the wax solidify slightly. Place the wicks into 
the center of where you intend each candle to be.
Before the wax is completely cooled, cut small squares out of 
the tin molds with a sharp knife and place each into the center 
of a candle mold. Candle molds come in various sizes and 
shapes and can be bought in any place that has an abundance 
of candle supplies or online, such as Pittsburgh Candle or 
www.candlesandsupphes.com. Candle molds are made of 
specific materials that are able to release the wax once it has 
cooled. After placing wax into the molds, add a little more 
liquid wax into each until it is full. After the molds are cooled,
flip the candles out onto wax paper and enjoy.
To make colored and scented candles, simply add food coloring 
or perfume to the liquid wax and stir. To make multi-colored 
candles, start with three containers full of wax, each in a 
different color. Pour a little of each color in a mold and swirl. 
Place the wick in the center and let the wax cool before using 
the candle.
Its also really cool to put unique items in your candle. 
Experiment with beads, seashells, glitter, and more. The only 
problem can be that usually when the candle burns all the way 
down, whatever you put in it will be left behind.
A quick way to get an interesting lacy pattern in a candle is to 
use ice. Start with a thin layer of wax at the bottom of a mold 
with the wick in it. Sprinkle shaved ice over the top of the layer 
of wax. Put another layer of wax over the top of the ice. Repeat 
the ice-wax sequence until the mold is full. As the wax cools, 
the ice will melt, causing intricate patterns and gaps. This is 
even more exciting if colored wax is used.
Making candles by hand can be thoroughly entertaining and 
rewarding. It can also be a fantastic opportunity to bond with 
friends over a hot pot of wax. And remember, why pay money 
when you can do it yourself?

that is still no reason to miss out on fine

or two about life and love. Harold is a 
young, privileged man who is changed 
forever upon meeting Maude, a lively 
woman about 60 years his senior. The 
movie runs the gamut of possible themes: 
suicide, family dysfunction, freedom, 
love, and friendship. Harold and Maude, 
which was a box-office flop upon initial 
release, is more than worthy of its place 
in the Library of Congress National Film

For anyone who has tried to read plays, it is likely that at 
least some difficulties have arisen. Its hard to imagine the 
italicized stage directions, to hear the dramatic lines of 
dialogue like Stella!" or Romeo, Romeo, or to envision the 
costuming, set design, lighting, music, or anything else that 
makes theater what'it is: an event to be seen.
And for anyone who has ever tried to write a play, this is more 
than an annoyance  its a problem. But students at the 
School of Drama's MFA program in dramatic writing suffer no 
such difficulty. In fact, each is required to write a full-length 
play to be performed in Purnell's annual New Plays Festival.
Fatis Last Dance
Bensons play Fatis Last Dance is one of the first comedies 
of her career. A lot of the plays that Ive written recently 
have been realiy dark and realiy serious, she said. I think 
[comedy is] a more effective way to get a message across." 
Fatis Last Dance tackles significant issues in a lighthearted 
manner, producing a style comparable to movies iike Little 
Miss Sunshine or The Royal Tenenbaums.
The play centers on the unfortunately named Fati {drama 
junior Brittany Campbell)  short for Fatima  a former 
dancer frustrated by insecurities about her body and the 
underlying guilt of her father's death. Fatima is living at 
home to care for her. mother, Gislene (Shammen McCune, 
a member of the Actors Equity Guild), a professional 
dancer. Other characters include Patrick (AEG member 
Joshua Elijah Reese), a lovable friend of the family who has 
a history with Fatima, and Ronielle (drama junior Victoria 
Ward), Fatimas slender and beautiful sister who  as fate 
would have it  cant dance to save her life.
In the story, Gislene rushes to prepare a dance scene 
to be filmed for a documentary on her late husband. As 
usual, Fatima refuses to dance, which leaves the klutzy 
Ronieife and Patrick, who turns out to be a natural. As the 
dances deadline approaches, Gisiene tries to convince 
Fatima that it is she who should be dancing.
On the surface, the play may seem a little like Save the Last 
Dance - dancing, dead parents, a romantic subplot, and 
race (Gislene is Haitian and often recalls her bleak past)  
but, through several twists and turns in the characters and 
plot, Benson was able to create a truly unique story. The 
comedy is spot-on and a talented cast of actors helped 
the script shine through.
This alone would make for an entertaining play, but the 
added presence of Fatima and Ronielles dead father is 
enough to take the story from entertaining to excellent. 
Throughout the play, the fathers jacket, hat, and tap shoes . 
are on display in the. comer of the stage, emphasizing 
his continuing role as the head of the household. Both 
Gislene and Fatima are able to communicate with him  
they speak aloud while the audience hears the fathers 
responses as a series of tap-dance noises. The effect is 
at once poignant and ingenious, speaking volumes on life 
and death within a family.

Dramatic writing students showcase new plays
The 2008 festival features four plays, each of which run for 
two weeks. Rob Smith's Tightrope and John-Paul Nickels 
Past Perfect/Future Tense were on stage through Feb. 9, while 
Carol J. Godarts Grae Matters and France-Luce Bensons 
Fati's Last Dance opened last Wednesday and Thursday, 
respectively, and run through Feb. 23. Both of the two-week 
time slots feature one comedy {Past Perfect/Future Tense or 
Fatis Last Dance) and one drama (Tightrope or Grae Matters).
body of work to the forefront.
The four MFA playwrights began writing their plays last 
summer and paired up with directors in September. Pines _ 
described this, pairing up as a speed-dating process"  the 
four playwrights and four directors had quick one-on-one 
conversations, comparing styles and perspectives. For Pines, 
Grae Matters offered an exciting challenge.
Once you have a draft, you really have to put it up on its 
feet, Benson said. It is crucial. Theres only so much you can 
do by yourself.
For Benson and the other writers, seeing their plays on 
stage helps them to figure out what works and what doesnt. 
The playwrights continue to revise their works throughout 
the process, even making small changes in between 
performances.
Often there are many rewrites. Its a long process, added 
Godart, who has gone through at least 10 drafts of Grae 
Matters. "Really, [the festival] is to benefit the play and the 
playwright."
"It was definitely the one that I read and was the most scared 
of, she said. I read it and was in over my head." Pines 
described frequent meetings with Godart at Shadysides 
Jitters Caf to discuss the meaning behind scenes in Grae 
Matters.
It was a priority of mine in grad school to open myself up to 
failing, she said. Before entering the MFA program, Pines 
worked on several plays in New York, where concerns for 
marketing and critical attention were paramount. The New 
Plays Festival afforded her an opportunity to take risks that 
shed been missing while working on her own.
The play and the playwright (and the process)
"We call it a workshop, which means it's not fully produced, 
said Kate Pines, an MFA student in the School of Dramas 
directing program and the director of Grae Matters. The idea 
is to really limit our resources and really focus on the play 
itself."
Grae Matters
, Perhaps the polar opposite of Fatis Last Dance, Godarts 
Grae Matters is a serious, introspective work. The story 
revolves around Mrs. Grae (drama senior Jessica Waxman), 
described on the shows poster as a Jung woman.
As this label might suggest, Grae Matters is a play rooted in 
Jungian psychology, developed by Swiss psychiatrist Gar! 
Jung in the early 20th century. The story encompasses 
many of Jungs ideas, including the collective unconscious 
(the basic emotions shared by most people) and the shadow 
(the repressed aspects of an individuals personality).
As a result, Grae Matters is on the surface a very 
confusing play, especially for audience members without 
some knowledge of psychology. Still, director Pines noted 
that each aspect of the script is there for reason  it is 
not art for arts sake, but rather a reflection of Godarts 
perspective. Pines described how Godart was able to field 
questions about the play from the cast.
Whatever [the actors] asked, she had an answer," Pines 
said. I think the cast really respected that.
New Plays productions have significantly smaller budgets and 
production staffs than most of Purnell's other shows. Though 
the lack of resources can be challenging, it helps to bring the

Like Pines, Fati's Last Dance director Dana Friedman enjoyed 
being paired with her playwright, Benson.
I was relieved, excited. I felt like I won in a way," she said. 
This is the experience we've been waiting for. We both love 
the play. We trust each other. We have the same goals with 
the play.
The playwrights and directors rehearsed with actors from the 
School of Drama for four weeks before showing their plays. 
During their shows two-week runs, the playwrights have to 
strike a difficult balance between changing too much and 
changing too little; the actors need time to learn new lines and 
directions, but the playwrights must take advantage of the 
festival as a venue for experimentation.
Because we have performances next week, I cant do much 
[right now], Benson said.
When the festival is over, each playwright will work with a 
different MFA director to benefit from a new perspective.
The writers also benefit from several critiques along the way, 
from informal after-show talkbacks, to in-class critiques, to 
feedback from visiting respondents.
The playwrights will turn in their final" drafts along with the
rest of their portfolios to complete their MFA theses. But even 
at this point the plays will not be complete. ..
I think most of us will probably keep writing," Smith said.
Yeah, itll be fine once it goes to Broadway and its 
published," Nickel joked. (It will be fine until the revival, he 
added, atwhich point hell revise it once more.)
The portfolios include all of the students finished work from 
throughout the two-year program. The playwrights have 
created plays and screenplays of various lengths to fulfill their 
requirements, providing them a more diverse education than 
other gxaduate programs.
You dont do one [type of work], Smith said. You get a good 
mix of it all."
Our portfolio will probably be close to 1000 pages, Nickel 
added. We kill a lot of trees.
Carnegie Mellons dramatic writing program is unique for two 
reasons. First, the New Plays Festival guarantees playwrights 
a chance to see their work performed, an opportunity 
that many other programs fail to offer. Additionally, the 
dramatic writing MFA is a two-year program,although most

comparable programs are three years. The School of Drama's 
curriculum fits in the allotted time, the playwrights agree, but 
barely.
"Its non-stop for two years, Nickel said.
We put in 90 or 100 hours a week, added Godart, who 
also teaches Introduction to Playwriting for undergraduates 
through the School of Drama.
Still, the playwrights believe that all the revisions, rehearsals, 
and even meetings at Jitters are worth the struggle. The 
New Plays Festival, in particular, helps to bring their work to 
fruition.
Its been great, Benson said, speaking of the festival. "This 
is pretty much what I wanted coming to the MFA program 
here.
Grae Matters continues this week with performances Feb. 20 
at 8 p.m., Feb. 22 at 8 p.m., and Feb 23 at 2p.m. Fatis Last 
Dance is showing Feb. 21 at 8 p.m., Feb: 22 at 4 p.m., and Feb. 
23 at 8 p.m. Tickets are free and available one hour before the 
show. All performances are in the Purnell Center's John Wells

Scotch n Soda performs Proof
Last weekend, Scotch n Soda put on a show for the 
ages, performing David Auburns Proof a total of three 
times. Directing duties were handled by sophomore music 
composition major Scott Wasserman, who has performed in 
over 30 plays and musicals in his career and was the assistant 
director on The Complete Works of William Shakespeare 
(Abridged) last semester. Wasserman was assisted by first-year 
business major Stephen Chan.
It was unic[ue directing a show that I previously had no 
contact with, as far as seeing the film or watching the play, 
said Wasserman.
This was my first directing experience and its been a 
privilege working with Scott and the amazing cast," said Chan. 
"Im a freshman, but [the actors] listen to my opinions and 
thats really amazing. It was really fun to work the crew, too.
Proof is a humorous yet dramatic play 
that focuses on four central characters:
Catherine, Hal, Claire, and Robert. Catherine, played by 
Scotch n Soda vice president and sophomore BHA student 
Shannon Deep, is the 25-year-old daughter of Robert, a recently 
deceased mathematical genius, who is played (as a'ghost and 
in flashbacks) by senior computer science major Dan Tasse. 
Scotch n Soda president and junior economics major Alex 
DiClaudio plays Hal, an eager former student of Roberts who is 
on the downside of his mathematics career at the age of 28. 
Sophomore materials science and engineering major Sharon 
Wang, in her first Scotch 'n' Soda performance, rounds out the 
cast as Claire. The antithesis of her sister Catherine, Claire is a 
proper and slightly neurotic New Yorker who flies in to attend 
her fathers funeral and settle some affairs.
The play opens on Catherines 25th birthday, about a 
week following her fathers death, with Catherine having a 
conversation with her father. We learn quickly that Robert had 
some sort of mental illness in the years leading up to his death 
and that Catherine dropped out of college in order to take 
care of him. We then meet Hal, a professor at the University of 
Chicago, who is trying to find something other than nonsense 
in Roberts old notebooks. Catherine and Hals first interaction, 
which becomes their first argument, gives us a good look into 
the personalities of each. Catherine is a troubled girl who 
doesnt want to discuss her genius father and prefers to let his 
memory rest; the bulk of her life was spent (but not wasted, as 
we later learn) taking care of him. Hal is an enthusiastic young 
man, but struggling in his own research, who refuses to believe 
his late mentor completely lost his mind due to his mental 
illness.
Hals eagerness is shown throughout the first act as he tries 
to woo the initially unwilling Catherine during Robert's wake, 
which turns into an all-night party. They eventually fall for 
each other during a conversation about mathematics after 
a hilarious "exprimentation joke about mathematicians 
and their sexual exploits while at conferences  probably 
the funniest line in what was really quite a hilarious play.
After sleeping with Hal, Catherine decides to trust him with 
a notebook containing a groundbreaking proof, and the first 
act comes to a close following the shocking admission from 
Catherine that she wrote it.
The second act, which is much more somber than the first, 
centers around the historic proof, and how there is no proof
(i.e., evidence) of whether the actual author is Catherine or her

father. Catherine vehemently claims she wrote it, but Claire 
and Hal have serious doubts, leading to a rant by Catherine 
that would make any man turn to jelly. Hal storms off and 
Catherine breaks down and isnt seen again, except for a 
flashback, until the end of the play. Hal and Catherine appear 
to reconcile when he returns to claim the proof indeed was 
likely written by Catherine. The play ends with the two sitting 
side-by-side going over some of the more complicated portions 
of the proof.
Scotch 'n' Sodas acting was stellar for the most part, if not 
a bit stale in some of the earlier one-on-one scenes involving 
Catherine and Hal or Catherine and Robert. But the play 
definitely hit the ground running following Hal and Catherine's 
first argument. The actors did an excellent job of letting their 
.own emotions seep into the audience, leaving a very authentic 
feeling of each sensation expressed. Each gets a personal rant 
to let his or her sentiments be known, coming through with a 
rage that reverberates around the room.
Extra honor must be extolled upon Deep for her convincing 
portrayal of Catherine, whose profound fear of loneliness after 
so many years spent mostly alone is saddening; eventually, her 
character is able to pull through due to her individual strength.
It was my first dramatic lead and I really enjoyed it, she said. 
Ive been involved in every Scotch n Soda performance 
[since Ive been at Carnegie Mellon] except for one and this 
was my favorite. I really enjoyed getting to know and work with 
the cast and crew and I think we became real good friends at 
the end.
Praise must also be given to the choice of music during scene 
changes. It set the mood perfectly for upcoming scenes. What 
also may be lost after the plays somber conclusion was how 
genuinely funny it was. Perfect timing coinciding with some 
well-placed awkward moments greatly improved the play. 
Overall, Proof is a highly original and expertly directed and 
acted play that was an absolute joy to watch.
