VARSITY DEFEATED
IN OPENER.
Team Fields Well But Cant Hit.
The Varsity baseball team lost the 
first game of the season last Saturday 
to Duquesne University through ina
bility to connect with Meehans deliv
ery, the final score being 3 to 0. Urquhart, who started the game for Car
negie, pitched well for five innings 
and was given great support. He was 
withdrawn to allow Lane to bat for 
him in a pinch,* and was replaced by 
Hoerr. The latter is a new candidate, 
but, judging from the showing made 
on Saturday, will make a good man to 
rely on. He went into the game on 
short notice, but allowed only one hit 
in four innings. He issued three pass
es to first in that time, but steadied 
when in a hole. Lobert was the only 
Techite to connect safely. One of his 
three hits went into the wire fence 
for three bases and the other two were 
clean singles. On his last trip to the 
bat he drew four balls. In the field he 
made a remarkably good showing at 
the first station. Bill Moorhead also 
deserves credit for his work behind 
the bat. His cool steadiness and good 
throwing power will make him as val
uable as a catcher as he has previous
ly been at first base.
Meehan practically won his own 
game, as his support was in no way 
remarkable. The first scoring was 
done in the fourth inning. McDonall 
the second man up, hit a single to 
right field, and stole second. Drew 
flied out to Kirk, then Cartwright 
caught an inshoot on the end of his 
bat and sent the ball to the bluff, 
where it stuck in the mud long enough 
to allow a circuit of the bases, while 
McDowell scored ahead of him. In 
the seventh, with one down, Cart
wright was walked to first, and went 
to second on a passed ball. Morrow 
also walked. Glitsch bunted, landing 
safely and advancing Morrow while 
Hoerr threw Cartwright out at third. 
Hall tried for a double play, but in his 
anxiety threw over Loberts head, 
Morrow scoring from second.

MUSICAL CLUBS
OFFICERS FOR 1913-14.
Election Held Early This Year.
Owing to the fact that the early 
election of the officers for The Musi
cal Clubs last year bettered the con
ditions of the clubs this season, it was 
considered very expedient to have an 
early election this season and the re
sults are that on Sunday, March 30th, 
the clubs elected the following men 
to hold office during the season 1913- 
14:
President, Lewis R. Madison.
Manager, N. A. Hollister.
Secretary and Treasurer, Frederich
E. Schuchman.
Publicity Manager, John A. Cam
eron.
Stage Manager, G. C. Smith.
Mandolin Club Librarian, Wm. H. 
Kirchenbower.
Glee Club Librarian, E. Wm. Gay
lord.
This enables the new officers to get 
busy and have the clubs in splendid 
condition for next season. Mr. Madi
son succeeded in pulling the clubs 
through a very successful season 
in 1911-12, during which time he was 
manager. His wonderful managing 
ability is evidence of the fact that 
the clubs will thrive under his super
vision. Mr. N. A. Hollister was ap
pointed manager just a few weeks 
before the home concert which was 
given March 12th, 1913. The manag
ing ability Mr. Hollister displayed 
during his short time of office im
pressed the members of the clubs so 
much to the effect that he was elected 
manager for the season 1913-14. The 
office of business manager of the clubs 
for the coming season will be filled by 
appointment.
With due credit to all of the officers 
of the clubs for this season it is hoped 
that the clubs of 1913-14 will make a 
record far surpassing that of the 
clubs of 1912-13.
NOTICE.
The Tech Mechanics Club Baseball 
Team (Industries Upper Classmen) 
has organized for the season and 
would like to arrange games with 
other teams in the schools. Managers 
please address, T. E. Weiler, manager, 
Industries Mail Box.
There will be weeping, wailing and 
gnashing of teeth the day the Thistle 
appears among those who havent a 
receipt. It is easier to buy than to 
ruin your molars gnashing them to
gether. Get your receipt.
BUCHTEL HERE NEXT.
Team Hopes to Vindicate Itself.
Our first real contest is over, and 
shows the Plaid team sadly deficient 
in batting. However, we hope this 
can be remedied by Saturday, when 
we cross bats with Buchtel.
Our team displays excellent team 
work. Guy Wehrs tremendous bat
ting is sadly in need. With Wehr 
batting last Saturday the game would 
have had a different ending. It is 
hoped that Wehr can be induced to 
play again this year. Hoar and Urquhart are showing fine twirling form 
this year.- Hines and Snyder will also 
be able to hold their own.
Lobert, the star of last Saturdays 
game, can be depended on to keep 
the good work up the entire season, 
and Tech will have the finest team 
in Western Pennsylvania.
Next Tuesday we will proceed to 
get sweet revenge from Duquesne 
University for the defeat we suffered 
last Saturday. Techs team work and 
fielding was far superior to our worthy 
opponents, but our batting was very 
poor. Lobert seemed to be the whole 
batting force, getting 3 out of the 4 
hits. However, with lots of practice, 
we intend to win all the rest of the 
games this season. A good crowd of 
rooters is asked for next Tuesday 
afternoon. Admission will be free to 
Tech students. The game will be 
played on the Duquesne University 
grounds.
On account of it Being Charette 
week for all classes, the Design School 
will be poorly represented in the In
ter-school meet Saturday.
M. M. C. S. RECEIVES 
PRESENT FROM CHINA.
Miss Kitty C. McMullen, graduate 
of Margaret Morrison in 1909, has pre
sented to the school through the 
Alumnae Association a Chinese tea 
cloth. This cloth is made of a vege
table fibre, woven and embroidered 
with emblems of happiness, wealth, 
and long life. The tea cloth is typi
cally oriental and symbolizes every
thing good in life for its users. Miss 
McMullen has spent two years in 
China studying the language and cus
toms of the country and has opened 
a school there, a M. M. C. S. in min
iature. She writes that all letters and 
messages thankfully received.
The address is Miss Kitty C. Mc
Mullen, Tunghiang. Chekiang Prov
ince, China.
FOUNDERS DAY.
Gov. Hadley Will be the Speaker.
The Speaker for Founders Day will 
be Gov. Hadley of Missouri. Gov. 
Hadley is considered the most bril
liant political orator of the day. It 
will be remembered the Governor 
played a most prominent part in the 
last Republican convention. He was 
one of the state executives that urged 
the nomination of Col. Roosevelt but 
refused to bolt and form a new party. 
He was the man concerning whom 
President Taft said, If Gov. Hadley 
should be nominated as a compromise 
candidate, I would withdraw. It was 
only the refusal of Col. Roosevelts 
support that prevented Gov. Hadley 
being the present president of the 
LTnited States.
The remainder of the program will 
be as usual. Mr. Heinroth will render 
a selection on the organ. Mr. Frew 
will announce the rewards for the In
ternational Art Exhibition. Director 
Hamerschlag will present his annual 
report, and the school chorus and the 
Mendel sohn Male Choir will sing.
INTER-SCHOOL MEET.
A Most Interesting Meet Is Promised 
for Saturday.
Everybody is training for the big 
event of the year. Nightly a big 
squad of men are out on the field 
getting into shape for the inter-school 
meet Saturday. However, a few men 
wrho should be out, arent. Show your 
spirit. Help your school to win. This 
will be the first time this year that 
the entire squad w'ill be out. From 
the showing Saturday, the team wThich 
will represent the Plaid this year, will 
be picked.
On account of the baseball game 
with Buchtel at 3 oclock, the track 
meet will start at one oclock sharp. 
It is positively necessary that every 
one be punctual.
There will be three places awarded. 
Medals will be awarded to all three 
places.
The following is the list of events:
100-yard dash, 220-yard dash, 440- 
yard run, 880-yard run, one mile relay,
4 lap; high hurdles, low hurdles, two 
mile, pole vault, high jump, discus, 
hammer, shot put, broad jump.
Come out and break some records. 
Show your spirit and make the other 
fellow follow.
Uncle Louie has returned. He re
ports an excellent time, and says he 
enjoys being the village hero.

"One of the most important de
cisions that can be made by a man 
is the choice of his career. There 
sometimes arise emergencies in which 
the individual has no real freedom of 
choice, but such emergencies are rare. 
The victim of circumstances is the 
product too often of either a flabby 
intellect incapable of grasping the 
importance of the decision, or of a 
weak will which leads the individual 
to surrender at the first shadow of 
difficulty. The average man who has 
a sound constitution as an asset can 
obtain the training to do the thing 
to which he is adapted, and which 
he wills to do, provided he pay the 
price in work, time and energy, which 
even the free education of today de
mands.
And such is the problem now con
fronting many of the members of our 
Plebe Class, the problem of Which 
course shall I take? Heretofore, a 
series of lectures were given to the 
Plebe Class by the heads of each de
partment in order to assist the stu
dent in his choice, but this year those 
lectures did not appear in the curricu
lum of the above mentioned class. 
Many have wondered if these import
ant lectures were to be done away 
with altogether. However, a much 
better system has been planned by 
our Faculty, which consists of a book
let that will present all courses to 
the student upon an equal basis.
, Everyone knows what the courses 
are. but very few know the subdi
visions of each course and the varied 
education one can get here. In Chem
ical Engineering, the field is much 
broader than is popularly supposed. 
The Chemical Engineer does not man
ufacture chemicals alone, for there 
are many other industries depend di
rectly upon chemical engineering 
knowledge. Under this class some 
such manufactures as rubber, varnish, 
Portland cement, petroleum pfoducts, 
etc. This course is rather broad, and 
includes the elements of Electrical 
and Mechanical Engineering.
Civil Engineering is divided into 
three branches: Structural, Road and 
Railway, and Hydraulic Engineering. 
There are no main subdivisions under 
the first two branches but under the 
third branch mentioned come Water 
Supply, Water Power, Irrigation, 
Canal Construction, etc.
The field for Commercial Engineers 
is broadening every year. Hereto
fore, it was usually filled by a man 
from one of the other branches of 
engineering, but a course is now pre
sented where one can receive a direct 
course along the lines of production 
or efficiency engineering. The cur
riculum for this course includes all 
subjects fundamental to an engineer
ing training as well as the general 
engineering subjects distributed 
among the different departments.
Manufacturing, Transmission and 
Distribution of Power, and Transmis
sion of Intelligence, are the branches 
of Electrical Engineering. . Under 
manufacturing might be included sale 
and installation of machinery. Elec
tric traction, electrification of steam 
railroads, and electric lighting are the 
main sub-divisions for Transmission of 
Power. Transmission of Intelligence 
includes telegraph, telephone, and 
railway signalling.
Mechanical Engineering is the sci
ence of machinery, of its design, con
struction, production, testing, and in
spection, its installation and super
vision. The Mechanical Engineer has 
to deal with the problems of genera
tion of power and also the transmis
sion of that power, unless the latter 
is done by electricity.
With the installation of the new 
Sanitary Engineering laboratory, this 
course has been greatly improved, and 
although many subjects of this course 
come under the Civil department, it 
deals with watgr supply from a hy
gienic standpoint, sewerage, collec
tion and disposal, refuse collection and 
disposal, and street and river clean
ing. This course has one of the broad
est fields in the engineering profes
sion, and already sanitary engineers 
are in great demand.
The Metallurgical Engineering course 
is designed to prepare a man for the 
work of extracting metals and min
erals from masses of rock, and put them 
into merchantable or workable form. 
Elementary Electrical and Mechanical 
Engineering also enter into this 
course.
Mining Engineering, although deal
ing with metals, does not classify 
them in the same manner. As stated 
above, Metallurgical Engineering has 
to do with the metals after they come 
from the ground, but the problems of 
the Mining Engineer consist in gettting 
the ores to the surface with the great
est efficiency in every way.
Good Night Nurse, the only song 
that is music to Guys ears.
FACULTY LUNCHEON.
The monthly luncheon of the Facul
ty of the School of Applied Industries, 
held at the German club last Satur
day evening, was an affair of unusual 
interest. After the preliminaries, with 
Dean Connelley as master of cere
monies, Director Hamerschlag was 
called upon to open the talk-fest. 
The Director was at himself and gave 
a rattling good talk on the work of the 
Institute, warming up particularly on, 
as he put it, The Mission of the 
School of Applied Industries.
Prof. Peters followed the Director 
and gave a very clear exposition of 
the much-discussed Montessori Meth
od of Teaching. This talk brought 
forth an animated discussion in which 
the Director, the Dean, Wm. Ramsey 
of the Art section of the Institute, 
Professor Morris, and Dr. Libby took 
part. As a whole the luncheon was 
one of most distinctly worth, while 
events ever held by the Industries 
Faculty.
Professor, wife and friends visiting 
Europe on a pleasure trip, wish a 
few more paying guests to complete a 
congenial party. Tourist element 
entirely eliminated. For particulars, 
address Prof. A. Ritter, University of 
Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pa.

4THE TARTAN
OH, YOU CIRCUS DAY!
Big Time for Next Weeks Celebration
The clowns are entered into a keen 
competition to collect the biggest 
variety of new and really funny jokes 
for the carnival and circus next Wed
nesday night. The animals are trying 
.all sorts of soul-stirring and blood
curdling noises; and the acrobats are 
clail>r risking broken necks in order 
that their part of the show shall win 
the greatest applause. The late Mr. 
P. T. Barnum, in his palmiest days, 
never had anything on the experts 
who are arranging for the side shows 
with the funny freaks.
The schedule for the evening in
clude a one-ring circus on the main 
floor of the gym., while the side-shows 
and refreshment joints will be ar
ranged in the corridor and in the gal
lery. The doors will open at 7:30, 
rain or shine, and will not be closed 
against anyone with the price. The 
performance will be run until 9 
oclock, when the floor will be cleared. 
The second part of the evening will 
be devoted to a concert by the leading 
musicians of the school, which will be 
followed by a dance.
The terms are 50 cents a couple for 
the circus and separate tickets at 50 
cents a couple for the concert and 
dance. That means only one dollar 
for an evening of entertainment and 
pleasure for two persons, you and 
your lady friend. When one considers 
that it cost Uncle Andy one million 
times as much to furnish us some
thing to celebrate at this time, no stu
dent should hesitate over one single 
unit of the monetary system. After 
the enormous expenses of staging this 
big event have been liquidated, the 
profits will be devoted to the needs of 
the baseball team, that bunch of men 
who are going to write the name of 
Carnegie Tech on the walls of the 
Hall of Fame. To a man with some 
spirit, no other argument for his pres
ence should be needed.
One of the big features will be the 
Marcelline Family of acrobats. Three 
generations will be represented and 
will furnish marvelous thrills at im
minent risks of life and limb. A troupe 
of Russian dancers, direct from M. M.
C. S., will exhibit wonderful poems of 
motion. Innumerable other acts will 
be staged, funny, thrilling, or edu
cating. Real peanuts will be sold by 
the same boy that will furnish the 
beautiful pink lemonade to wash them 
down.
Tickets are on sale this week in all 
of the schools, and if you miss the 
man you can buy at the door. Re
member that the dance tickets are 
limited in number and you must hur
ry to get one. Here is the chance for 
a big celebration. Make the most of
it. ' ---------------------

MHO CLUB MEETING.
The April meeting of the Mho Club 
was held Wednesday evening, April 
9th, 1913, in Room 121. After a short 
business session the program, which 
had been arranged for the evening, 
was taken up.
The program was in the hands of 
the Seniors and was as follows:
Ontario Power Company, R. W. 
Freeland.
Hydraulic Power Company, L. E. 
Griswold.
The Hydro-Electric Commission, H.
H. Johnston.
Power Plants About Akron, W. F. 
Stuckeman.
These plants were visited by the 
Seniors on their Niagara trip during 
inspection week and the speakers all 
handled their subjects well, making 
it a most interesting as well as a 
most instructive meeting. After 
the program came the regulation 
eats and social period until the 
lights went out. A rising vote of 
thanks was given the Seniors for the 
excellent program.

CIVIL SOPHS WIN 
ANNUAL MEET.
Nose Out Juniors
Last Wednesdays Civil Deparment 
meet was won by the Sophomores, 
who scored 35% points against 33% 
for the Juniors and 21 for the Seniors. 
As none of the contestants had trained 
seriously for the meet, none of the 
marks set were remarkable, but many 
of the events were interesting. The 
Sophs had the largest number of con
testants entered, but the fewr upper 
classmen evened things up by allaround athletic ability. Culp, by win
ning the 100-yard dash, the 220-yard 
dash, the low hurdle race, the broad 
jump, and taking third place as a mem
ber of the Junior relay team, was the 
individual star of the meet, with 20% 
points.

THISTLE NEWS.
A call from Mr. W. E. Humpstead, 
business manager of the new Frank
lin Printing Co., has convinced us that 
the Thistle will be ready for distribu
tion on May 1st. It is hard to con
ceive that such a thing is possible 
after the numerous delays on delivery 
in the past, nevertheless it is true. A 
dummy which has been sent to us 
bound in the ooze leather covers is 
now in the hands of the editor-inchief, Haaren, and is now on display. 
It is sure going to be some book and 
you can take our word for it. If you 
are not prepared to present a receipt 
for your book there is but a slight 
possibility that you will be able to 
procure a copy. However, the Thistle 
representatives will still accommodate 
those, who for financial reasons, have 
neglected to supply themselves with 
a receipt. Just 18 days more until the 
Thistle is out. Watch for the open
ing sale and be there first.
Every employee of the Bank of 
England is required to sign his name 
in a book on his arrival in the morn
ing, and if late, must give the reason 
therefor. The chief cause of tardiness 
is usually fog, and the first man to ar
rive w'rites fog opposite his name, 
and those who follow write ditto. 
The other day, however, the first man 
late gave as the reason, wife had 
twins. and 20 other late men mechan
ically signed ditto underneath.
The old system of usi.ig a heated 
iron and dirty cloth prespps the grime 
and dirt into your garments. Our 
sanitary machine steams it all out, and 
removes permanently the dirt, pers
piration, odor and grime. See Shu
man the Dry Cleaner, 3911 Forbes 
street.
April first proved to be a very in
teresting day for Louie. Being a 
ladys man, he was not surprised 
when a feminine voice from over 
the wire made a date with him for 
that fateful day down by the lake. 
Right* on the job next day he met 
her at the appointed time and after 
about an hours tete-a-tete on a se
cluded bench he finally tumbled that 
a naughty man was behind the veil. 
In his confusion he made matters 
worse and now LTncle is buying the 
cigars as a price for silence among 
his fellow architects.
