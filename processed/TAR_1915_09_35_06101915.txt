SENIOR BANQUET A 
REAEJJYE AFFAIR
The Senior Banquet was held at 
the Fort Pitt Hotel and it was some
what of a banquet, too. The banquet 
began promptly at seven-thirty and 
ended, oh, well, we dont just know 
when, as reports on this point con
flict greatly. Some claim that they 
got home at twelve oclock while 
others give the hour as varying from 
three to five oclock. By the law of 
averages it was finally found that the 
banquet ended at 3:45 A. M.
The speakers gave some very in
teresting talks, which were much ap
preciated by the class. Reverend 
Frederick Lower Galpen was the 
speaker of the evening, and gave a 
most interesting talk on a technical 
subject which was new to most of 
us, and which proved that there was 
someone else who knew a little about 
hydraulics besides Prof. Mott. The 
speech was entitled Spiritual Hy
draulics. Mr. Redding then respond
ed to a toast entitled Men. Few 
men in this institution are better qual
ified to talk on such a subject than 
Mr. Redding, and such being the case 
what he had to say was well worth 
the opportunity to listen to. Harry 
Balsinger, the honorable president of 
the Senior class of the School of Ap
plied Science, who in the fall bedecks 
himself in a football suit, and then 
during the rest of the year spends 
most of his time at the Murphy 
Dorm, being admired by the worship
ing Margaret Morrison Cooking 
School damsels, much to the envy of 
another said M. M. C. S. student, 
came across with a corker of a speech, 
as well as a brand new story, after 
which everybody laughed till the tears 
rolled down their necks and wilted 
their collars. Ballys story started 
the ball rolling, and others followed 
just as fast as Skinny Sheldon, the 
toastmaster, could call for them, and 
incidentally it might be added that 
he told one or two also.
The menu has not been included 
in this article for fear of making the 
readers 'hungry, but it might be add
ed that it included everything from 
soup to fingerbowls, the contents of 
which was relished by many of the 
banqueters. Steins were given for 
favors. Sousa furnished the music 
and Gin Rickey furnished the punch.
16 S(IEN(E ADOPTS SELF-GOVERNMENT
NEXT YEARS (IASS VOTES FOR STUDENT CONTROL
At a regularly called meeting of the 
present Science Juniors on last Tues
day at 4:30 in Room 218 Science, the 
class voted twenty-five to six to adopt 
the self-government code given be
low.
This was the second meeting held 
on this subject, which was decided 
this year at the request of the Dean, 
in order that it might go into effect 
with the beginning of the next school 
year. The necessity for this was 
shown this year when the present 
Seniors spent a greater part of the 
year discussing the question without 
adopting anything definite. They 
had, however, the option of taking 
their examinations either under the 
honor system or under the supervi
sion of the faculty.
At the first meeting, a long discus
sion of the code centered around the 
provisions of Article II, Section 3, 
which provides for compulsory re
porting of all cribbing cases witnessed 
by the students accepting the code. 
At the first meeting a motion was 
passed making this not compulsory; 
but when a reconsideration of this was 
moved, a few men who made the dif
ference between a quorum and too 
few to transact business, left the 
room, and by their lack of class spirit 
compelled adjournment.
At the second meeting, the class 
knew what they wanted and in a 
short time voted to adopt the com
pulsory reporting clause, which was 
the point on which this years Seniors 
split.
The constitution as given below 
represents a great deal of hard work 
on the part of the committee, w'hich 
was composed of W. Earl Boak as 
chairman, with Claude Ettele, L. P. 
Maier, Harry Newcomb, and Benja
min Schwartz. It was adopted sub
stantially as read, the changes being: 
first, the definition of the cases stated 
under Article I, Section 2, as viola
tions of the code; second, the substi
tution of the below given Section 2 
of Article II at the request of the 
Dean for the original which provided 
that all reports should be sent from 
the instructor to the Student Council, 
and at no time to the Deans office: 
Second. This change does not mean 
that the Dean sees any record of the 
absences, and in fact he said that he 
did not wish to see them and would 
not as long as the man was under the 
supervision of the Student Council;
third, the change which requires the 
uanimous vote of the council for the 
rendering of the verdict of guilty 
from that w'hich allowed for one dis
senting voice; and fourth, the change 
from the requirement of a unanimous 
vote for an amendment.to that requir
ing three-quarters vote, with the pro
vision for withdrawal as stated in the 
section, Article VI, Section 3.
One result of this code will be the 
existence of two classes of Seniors, 
those under self-government, and 
those who do not sign the instrument. 
This may cause some complication; 
but the committee believes that it can 
be worked out satisfactorily. It is 
not likely that all of the Seniors will 
sign the provisions drawn up.
Substantially as adopted by the 
class, the code appears below:
PURPOSE AND EXPLANATION 
OF STUDENT SELF-GOV
ERNMENT AT CARNEGIE.
The purpose of this constitution is 
to establish a means of self-govern
ment among the Science Seniors at 
Carnegie. Its purpose shall be pri
marily for the good of the man, and 
not essentially a system merely to 
eliminate dishonesty and fraud.
In order to accomplish its purpose, 
any system must be believed in, sup
ported by and aided by all men guid
ed by its provisions. Therefore, this 
Constitution provides that all students 
desiring to participate in student selfgovernment here shall sign the Con
stitution.
Much credit is due former classes 
at Carnegie, and it is hoped that SelfGovernment will ultimately become a 
tradition here.
PREAMBLE.
The undersigned members of the 
Day Senior Class of the School of 
Applied Science, Carnegie Institute 
of Technology, believing themselves 
to be capable of self-government, 
hereby agree to regulate their con
duct as students in accordance with 
the following provisions:
ARTICLE I.
Section 1. In all cases of discipline 
the class shall act through a Senior 
Council to be elected by the class 
from its own members in accordance 
with Section 1. Article III, below.
Sec. 2. Senior Council shall have 
sole jurisdiction (except in the mat
ter of the imposition of penalty, as

THE ANNOUNCEMENT 
OF SCHOLARSHIPS
The Carnegie Institute of Technol
ogy announces the establishment, for 
one year, of ten award to be made 
to student of the three lower classes 
of the School of Applied Science for 
the purpose of establishing an honor 
system and increasing the spirit of 
scholarship among the students. The 
scholarships are to take the form of 
the remission of tuition fees (in 
whole or in part) and will probably 
be awarded as follows:
Upon the work of the Plebe year, 
four scholarships: one for excellence 
in each of the following subjects: 
Mathematics, Chemistry, English and 
German.
Upon the work of the Sophomore 
year, three scholarships: one for ex
cellence in each of the following sub
jects: Mathematics, Physics and Me
chanics.
Upon the work of the first three 
years, three scholarships; the basis of 
award to be determined later.
As a further means of stimulating 
scholarship the following actions have 
been taken by the Faculty:
1. An honor roll has been estab
lished for the Plebe and Sophomore 
years, consisting of the names of 
those whose average standing ex
ceeds a minimum to be fixed by the 
Committee.
2. An honor society is to be formed, 
based upon excellence in scholarship 
during the first three years of the 
course. It is hoped that eventually 
this honor society may become affi
liated with a national honor fra
ternity.
The announcement of these schol
arship awards is to be made at the 
first student assembly of the year.
The following is an extract from a 
letter received from Dean Goetze of 
the Schools of Mines, Engineering 
and Chemistry of Columbia Univers
ity, addressed to Director Hamerschlag:
Beginning with the academic year
1915-16 a number of fellowships in 
the new advanced courses in our 
Schools of Mines, Engineering and 
Chemistry will be awarded to stu
dents or graduates of a limited num
ber of colleges and technical schools 
of high rank.
In view of the very satisfactory 
showing which has been made by stu
dents who have come to us in the past 
from the Carnegie Institute of Tech
nology, we have decided to designate 
one of these fellowships to your inContinued on Page 2

WHAT THE GRADUATES EX
PECT TO DO.
By the time this paper comes from 
the press we will be college gradu
ates, and will be about to proceed to 
show the world how it should be run. 
We also expect after taking a slant 
at things in general to be able to offer 
suggestions as to how things should 
be done if this universe of ours were 
to be built over again. There is one 
thing we, as S class, are practically 
united in believing, which is, that 
when they made the earth they made 
one big mistake. Instead of taking 
one day to rest after having spent 
six days in putting the earth together, 
we would suggest that in the future 
on such occasions that the work be 
done in one day, and that who ever 
of us gets the job then take off six 
days to recuperate in. Such would 
be an inestimable benefit to mankind 
especially to the graduate. Take for 
example the case of the graduate just 
mentioned. If the earth had been 
made in one day, consequently giving 
us six days for Sunday, the one day 
which of course would have been the 
day before Sunday would have been 
Saturday. Now then, Saturday is a 
half holiday, which means that in
stead of having to larbor as we will 
now have to do, after we get our 
first positions, for five and a half 
days, we would if the world had been 
made correctly only have to labor 
for half a day, or four hours. Also 
assuming that the wage we are to get 
after graduation is to be ten dollars 
a week, then according to our scheme, 
we would receive pay at the rate of 
ten divided by four or two and a half 
dollars an hour, which we feel is near
er what we are worth than the paltry 
seventeen and a half cents an hour 
that most of us are to get. Therefore 
we have conclusively proved that 
there is but one thing left for us to 
do, if we and our future graduates are 
to get a living wage, or are to enjoy 
life, that is make the world over 
again.
WHAT ONE LITTLE FOOL 
CAN DO.
The following appeared in the Daily 
Texan of late issue:
WHAT ONE LITTLE FOOL 
CAN DO.
Going to knock em all dead when 
I get back in the little burg, we 
heard a little freshman say a few days 
ago. This freshman has been unfor
tunate enough to run through the 
year and have enough money left to 
buy a white serge suit, silk polka dot 
hose, panama hat, striped orange and 
red silk shirt with tie to unmatc'h and 
white kid shoes. He is going to 
wear this combination 'home. Last 
year he came here with an $18 suit 
of clothes with a shoe box full of fried 
chicken under his arm and a head full 
of good advice about economy. Not 
only is he going to wear the above 
mentioned outfit back home, but his 
speech and action are going to outHerod his clothes.
This fellow is a freshman and a 
fool. The University has to struggle 
continually to keep down false im
pressions of the extravagance of the 
students. The impression is false, for 
the average student is not extrava
gant; Im hard up; this is the com
monest expression on the campus. 
The man of whom we speak, even, 
has behaved himself pretty well dur
ing the year, he has studied hard and 
has spent his money discreetly. Now, 
he has decided that he must knock 
the little burg dead. Why? Well, 
chiefly because he thinks that he will 
disappoint his high school friends if 
he does not; partly, because it is a 
part of human nature to floss out. 
Yes, he is going back with 'his white 
silks and serges, with his head full of 
banquets, tangoes, billiards, sports, 
etc., not because the University has 
been instrumental in teaching his 
mind to run upon such things, but be
cause he is a natural fool, who has 
gotten away from 'home for the first 
time in his life and is too weak to 
resist the temptations to use the gifts 
with which nature has most bountiously endowed him  short-sighted 
conceit, selfishness and love of the 
gaudy.
Carnegie can put several thou
sand men in the field next summer to 
fig'ht for her good name. We are not 
free from the above type. Forty or 
fifty of such a nature can do as much 
harm as the other part of the student 
body can do good. Bad reports nat
urally take hold more firmly and 
spread more rapidly than do good 
ones, hence the forty or fifty fools 
with us can carry on a very success
ful campaign against Carnegie. The 
upperclassmen can eliminate some of 
this body. If you can you are doing 
a service to Carnegie.
A REVIEW AND AN OUTLOOK.
The past year, we can truthfully 
say, has been the most successful 
Carnegie has experienced. Our 
school has grown wonderfully new 
buildings, new improvements too nu
merous to mention have been wit
nessed by the student body. Dor
mitories are a reality, not to mention 
a new gymnasium and stadium. De
sign School, Margaret Morrison and 
Industries welcomed new additions. 
Our administration has been properly 
housed, let alone Carnegie Union. 
The efforts of Dr. Esquerre have 
been well rewarded in the Beanery. 
It has been such an improvement over 
the former. All we can do now this 
year is to return home feeling that 
we have done our best to raise a 
standard.
Next fall it remains for us to come 
back determined to do our best for 
Carnegie. Get together student 
body and make 1915-1916 the banner 
year. Support our teams and clubs 
to your utmost and come prepared to 
work. Many new and novel improve
ments and customs will be in effect 
upon your returning. Do one thing, 
boost and dont knock. It is just 
as easy to say a good word as a bad 
one.
THE TARTAN FOR 1915-16.
Come prepared next fall to buy that 
subscription to the Tartan. Although 
the past year 'has been an excellent 
one, we are going to try and go one 
better. Fellows, it is up to you to 
make your paper a success. Many 
new and interesting features are to 
be installed in your paper for the fall 
season. We call again for recruits 
for the board. It is worth your time 
now and we need you.
The board cannot put out a suc
cessful and interesting paper without 
the support of the student body. We 
have not had all we should in the 
past, but hope we may have more in 
t'he fall. Watch for our first issue 
next year. It will surprise you. Boost 
for your paper by subscribing.

THE PLAYS THE THING.
The mills of the gods grind slow, 
but they grind exceedingly small, as 
the reviewer has been brought to real
ize, after computing typographical 
errors and improvements on Dogber
rys use of English, but as this publi
cation is known to favor simplified 
spelling that probably accounts for 
everything that seems amiss.
It has not been the intention to 
overlook anyone in the various casts 
who has contributed to any part of 
the entertainment furnished to t'he 
student body, but one can speak only 
of what he sees and unhappily some 
performances were missed.
The final offering of the Depart
ment of Drama, As You Like It, 
was given under great difficulties be
tween the weather, etc., but made a 
very favorable impression on those 
courageous enough to sit it through. 
The play is very long and most of the 
audience left before its close, thus 
missing some of the best of the play. 
The dancing was a happy relief and 
helped one to forget how cold he was 
and when the wind happened to be in 
the right direction one could get the 
lines. Rosalind succeeded in making 
the epilogue heard and what Touch
stone had to say "got over, while 
one felt pretty sure Orlandos throat 
would be sore from his efforts to 
make himself heard. Out-door per
formances are usually a thankless and 
unsatisfactory task and one heard, 
on ever 'hand, regret expressed that 
so good a thing and so much work 
should be so nearly wasted. Of 
course, familiarity with the play made 
it easy to follow and weather condi
tions were ideal for the Friday after
noon performance. Mr. Merediths 
Touchstone was a new departure 
for him and very successful, while 
Miss Krebs as Audrey had all that 
creatures usual charm (?). The 
melancholy Jaques (Mr. Viehman) 
said his seven ages well and looked 
properly billious. Miss Quinn as 
Phoebe was pretty enough to break 
anyones heart, but one lost nearly 
all she had to say. Mr. Cather kept 
up the record he made as the Goatherdery, and one could not help wish
ing he might have had a try at Syl
vius also, although Mr. A. D. Brown 
did the part most acceptably.
Mr. Hirschberg was an ideal wrest
ler, nature having framed him for the 
part.
Mr. Wm. Price, as the clown, won 
his place as the champion funmaker 
and nearly had a small boy in 
convulsions at the afternoon per
formance, and Price is the 
fellow all the other schools dote 
on, no one has forgotten him as Oat
cake either, which only goes to show 
how much the world needs laughter.
Miss Beatrice Heinrich made a 
pretty Rosalind and Miss Katherine 
Jones as Celia was girlish and read 
her lines well. Mr. McConnells sing
ing propensity made him a very ac
ceptable Amicus, while his lines 
were easily followed.
Adam was well cast in the person 
of Mr. Duffy. All things considered, 
it was a very good out-door produc
tion. The student body cordially
joins Shaws William in saying 
Thank you, sir; thank you kindly.

SUMMER SCHOOL OF SURVEY
ING AT CAMP LOUISE 
CARNEGIE.
Location.The camp is situated on 
the east bank of the Allegheny River, 
about twenty-eight miles northeast 
of Pittsburgh and nearly opposite the 
town of Freeport, Pa. The property 
comprises seven hundred and fifty 
acres in a strip about one and threequarter miles long with an average 
width of three-quarters of a mile. It 
has a frontage of about two miles 
on the river.
Session.Junior students of the 
Civil Engineering, Sophomore stu
dents of the Civil, Mining and Sani
tary Engineering, and third and 
fourth year students of the Night Civil 
Engineering courses will report at 
camp before noon of registration day 
in the major course and remain for 
three weeks except the students of the 
night courses who remain for one 
week. Sophomore 'students of the 
Mechanical Engineering courses and 
the Middle Class students of the 
Building Construction course of the 
School of Applied Industries will re
port at camp before noon of regis
tration day in the minor course, re
maining for two weeks.
Students of the Electrical Engineer
ing course may take Sophomore Sur
veying course No. 153 A. S. at Camp 
Louise Carnegie during September 
preceding the Sophomore year, re
porting for work before noon of regis
tration day in the minor course and 
remaining for two weeks. It is dis
tinctly to the advantage of the stu
dent to take this work at camp, inas
much as the first term Sophomore 
work is thereby lightened and the 
two weeks outdoor work affords a 
pleasant and healthful outing. Stu
dents in Electrical Engineering who 
intend to take this course must give 
notice to that effect at the Deans of
fice before August 1.
Students of the Middle Class (ex
cepting those in the Building Con
struction course) of the School of Ap
plied Industries may take the course 
in Surveying No. 305 A. I. which is 
given at Camp Louise Carnegie. The 
work given in this course will be of 
considerable advantage to the stu
dent in his work after graduation, and 
all those who can avail themselves 
of this opportunity should do so. Stu
dents desiring to take this work must 
give notice to that effect at the Deans 
office not later than August 1. Stu
dents of the Middle Class of the 
Building Construction Department 
must take this course at Camp.
Any Applied Science student, other 
than those taking the Civil Engineer
ing Course, who has received notice 
from the Deans office to report at 
Pittsburgh for tutoring before the 
opening of school cannot attend camp, 
except by special arrangement with 
the Deans office.
To Reach CampFrom Pittsburgh, 
Pennsylvania depot, take local train 
on the Allegheny Valley Division of
the Pennsylvania R. R., getting off at 
Glencairn, if the train flags there; if 
not, go to Garvers Ferry and walk 
back one-half mile to camp. P. R. R. 
mileage for lines east is good on this 
division. Students using the West 
Penn Division should get off at But
ler Junction or Freeport. The camp 
is about one and one-half miles from
either of these two points.
Address.All baggage, exp re
mail or telegrams should be plan 
marked with the name of the pers

The toasts to our Alma Mater was 
the last one given. The class stood 
while Dorothy Skinner gave the toast.
Other features of the luncheon were 
the reminiscences of our school life 
by Sarah Murray and Louise MacMil
lan, and the Class Knocker, which was 
given by Carolyn Bowman.
The following girls also spoke very 
appropriately upon different phases of 
our class work in which they have 
been concerned. Mary McKee, Caro
lyn Bowman, Florence Hull and 
Mile. Kern.
One of the greatest pleasures of the 
luncheon, and one most enjoyed and 
appreciated by the girls was the beau
tiful gift books presented to them at 
this time by Miss Francis Parry.
The committee in charge of the 
luncheon was Mile. Kern, Florence 
Hull, Lydia Bates and Helen Harbison.
SHILLING BOARD FOR NEXT 
YEAR.
At the last assembly Dean Breed 
announced to the student body the 
names of the girls elected to mem
bership on the Shilling board for 
next year.
The Shilling is a Senior publica
tion, assisted by the Juniors. The 
girls are chosen for the general abil
ity and by their good records in 
school.
The Seniors who served on the 
Board this year were Anna Thomas, 
Dorothy Skinner, Marguerite Spilman, Ruth Welty, Lorna Williams, 
Mile Kern, and Lu. M. Hartman.
The Juniors on the board this year 
who will continue the work next fall 
are Constance Stout, Sara D. Wolfe, 
Blanche Booth and Charlotte Wat
son. Additional girls chosen this 
spring were: Marion Pichel, Grace
Searight, Maud Langford. Opal 
Rhein'hart, Katherine Wilson, and 
Elizabeth Deering of next years 
Junior class were the chosen assist
ants.
Constance Stout, who has been the 
Assistant Editor-in-Chief was elected 
to Editor-in-Chief. Miss Stout did 
excellent work on the Shilling during 
the past year. Marion Pichel was 
elected Business Manager by a unani
mous vote.
The Shilling Board of this year did 
much toward perpetuating the Shill
ing in the school. The class of 1915
feels as though this is one of the 
greatest achievements which it has 
helped forward.
The Board wishes to acknowledge 
the valuable assistance of Miss Parry 
who has been the advisory member 
of the board, and whose efforts have 
made the possibility of a school pub
lication in Margaret Morrison a real
ity.
Miss Parry entered Margaret Mor
rison as Professor of English the year 
that the class of 1915 entered as 
Plebes. She has been the honorary 
member of the class, and has helped 
us in many ways. In leaving Miss 
Parry the class feels as thoug'h they 
are leaving its one member who will 
best represent their truest and high
est ideals.
IVY DAY.
On Wednesday the Ivy Day exer
cises were given in the library of the 
M. M. C. S. building. Chairs were 
arranged on a platform at one end of 
the room and the class reached their 
places by marching single file down 
either side of the libraryhalf the 
class using the corridor, the other 
half using the balcony. The lines 
met in the center of the room and 
proceeded in a double line to their 
places.
The program was opened by the 
singing of The Womans Song, after 
which Dean Breed made an opening 
address. Miss Parry, the honorary 
member of the class, made a short 
address. The fourth number on the 
program was the Class History, read 
by Florence Lytle. Helen Stewart 
gave the Prophecy and the donor, 
Hazel Freeland, was assisted by the 
class artists, Dorothy Skinner and 
Lorna Williams, who had drawn char
acter sketches of each member.
The presidents of each of the class
es made short addresses, after which 
the class Will was read by Sara Mur
ray, Mile. Kern, the Secretary read 
the names for the last roll call after 
the singing of Dear Old Carnegie 
the Seniors led the procession to the 
campus where the Ivy Oration was 
given and the Ivy planted by Sara 
Murray.
IVY ORATION.
Each year a pin is awarded the suc
cessful contestant for the Ivy Oration. 
Members of the Senior class sub
mitted orations which were judged 
by a committee composed of Miss 
Hanna, Miss Marvin and Miss Mar
guerite Law, of the Alumnae Asso
ciation. For the planting of the Ivy 
a trowel was used upon which the 
numerals of each Senior class will be 
painted after the planting. The class 
of 15 is the first to start this custom.
In the Ivy Oration the Ivy plant 
was compared to the School, the stalk 
representing the Alma Mater, the 
roots the foundation with the Schools 
cornerstone for its aim. Each leaf 
represented a member of the class. 
It was brought out that each Leaf 
differed in size, shape and color, 
showing the difference in the develop
ment during the four years at M. M.
C. S. The color of the leaf typified
happiness and it was shown how this 
depended both upon those about us 
and upon the love and joy within our
selves which we alone can cultivate 
and bring out. The cl.v.mg para
graph was especially good and 
brought the significance of the Ivy 
planting home to all the audience. It 
was:
Now as we plant our Ivy we must 
not eypect it to cover the wall in a 
year. Its growth is a slow one but, 
if cared for, is sure. As the Ivy 
grows, we, too, shall grow. As we 
grow our Alma Mater will become 
stronger and greater and the aim of 
the School shall be even deeper and 
more far-reaching than now. If one 
leaf dies the true beauty of the Ivy 
will be spoiled. Let the watchword 
of the class of 1915 be Loyalty to 
our Alma Mater and to ourselves.
The program was closed by the 
singing of Farewell Alma Mater by 
the Seniors.
SENIOR PARTY.
The Senior class held a very in
formal entertainment in the recrea
tion room of the Margaret Morrison 
building on Monday evening. On ac
count of the rain, the senior banquet 
and the examinations there was a 
scarcity of both girls and men, but 
the few who came enjoyed the even
ing greatly. The committee in charge 
was Lorna Williams, Esther King 
and Ruth Hughes.
CLASS DAY PROGRAM.
On Thursday afternoon, the Mar
garet Morrison girls will give a para
sol drill on the campus in front of 
the Design School at five oclock. The 
class colors, lavender and gold will 
be carried out in the costumes of the 
seniors.
Miss Stoner has drilled the girls 
and Miss Ernst directed the making 
of the costumes.

A GLIMPSE OF IMPROVED 
TRADE.
If one will but listen, many sounds 
of a change and of better financial 
and business conditions can be heard. 
One of the prime factors which is al
ways gauged as a headliner in the 
opening of the springs business, is 
the opening of navigation upon the 
great lakes.
For two weeks the grain elevators 
at the upper end of Lake Superior 
have been pouring a golden store into 
the grain ships which are now near
ing Lake Erie. This vast grain ship
ment must impress one, when it is 
known that there is now 10,500,000 
bushels of wheat, flax, corn and oats 
nearing the Pittsburgh district.
In addition to this immense grain 
portage an iron ore shipment of 120,-
000 tons is now passing through the 
chain of lakes and will soon be feed

DESIGN SCHOOL NOTES
THE FINAL CONCERTS OF THE 
DEPARTMENT OF MUSIC.
This department of the School of 
Applied Design has now reached a 
stage in its development which seems 
to assure its final triumph and this 
has come about suddenly when one 
considers that it is hardly two and 
one-half years old. Mr. OBrien has 
succeeded in securing a corps of effi
cient instructors for the various in
struments and throughout the year 
concerts have been given in which a 
steady advance toward perfection has 
been evident, while the culmination of 
the two and a half years work tech
nically and artistically, was reached 
in the Bach programme given Thurs
day night by t'he class in ensemble un
der the direction of Mr. Malcherek, 
instructor on the violin. Mr. Mal
cherek has every reason to congratu
late himself on the results his work 
has brought forth. This programme 
left nothing to be desired; careful 
preparation combined wifh artistic in
telligence, resulted in an evening of 
delight to the audience and when this 
can be said of a Bach programme of 
this length it speaks strongly for the 
performers, for Bach, more than any 
other composer, makes the most ex
acting demands upon his interpreters.
The solo Fugue from Sonata No. 
1, for violin unaccompanied, played 
by Mr. A. Gordon-Stone, deserves 
special mention for a masterly per
formance of a very difficult number.
The ensemble numbers were given 
with a sureness of attack and a qual
ity of tone not to be improved upon.
It is safe to say that at no time 
since the disbanding of the Pittsburgh 
Orchestra has there been an ensemble 
concert equal to this one and Pitts
burgh may rejoice, that out of the 
wreck of that splendid organization, 
Mr. Malcherek has been saved and 
that this Institution has been fortu
nate enough to secure his invaluable 
service in its struggle to lift music 
out of the mediocre and to carry out 
the ideals of the founders of that or
ganization.
Space forbids individual mention 
except where unusual work has been 
done. There are two numbers on the 
Wednesday evening programme w'hich 
cannot be passed over: Sonata for 
Violin and Piano (Cesar Franck) 
Mr. Horace I. Brown, violin, Miss 
Hennig, piano; and the two piano 
numbers by Mr. Barner, who played 
with more than usual brilliancy and 
finish, the Chopin Etude Op. 10No. 
12 and Barcarolle by Moszkowski.
The Cesar Franck Sonata is a tre
mendous undertaking for both per
formers and was most artistically in
terpreted. The bigness of the under
taking fortunately swallowed up Mr. 
Browns usual timidity, and the result 
was a splendid performance, strong 
and vigorous, bringing out fully the 
intellectual breadth of the composi
tion. Miss Hennigs work at the piano 
was on the same high level.
The orchestral concert Sunday 
evening, J. Vick OBrien, conducting,
brought out the largest audience ever 
assembled in this building, standing 
room being at a premium.
The orchestra gave a very good ac
count of its years work and the solo
ists were satisfactory in all numbers 
and surprising in others. Mr. Glucks 
violin Concerto in G Minor was 
played wit'h much refinement and feel
ing, while Mr. Paul Sladeks Fantasie Caprice (violin) vieuxtemps, 
was just one more proof that Apollo 
presided, at his birth and that the 
musical world will hear from him in 
no uncertain manner in a few more 
years.
Miss Jennie Blooms playing of the 
First Movement of Griegs piano 
concerto with orchestral accompani
ment was an interesting feature of 
this programme. Her tone has soft
ness and depth wifhout loosing itself 
in the many voices of the orchestra.
Every one of the six concerts had 
regrets to leave unmentioned, but 
there is a limit, even to reviewing 
from the Editors point of view.

You may have heard of the Fac
ulty Club-room in Machinery Hall.
In its early days awestricken Jun
ior Electricals heard sounds, as they 
scudded past the carefully closed 
door, that gave rise to wild rumors. 
One that the schools had beaten our 
versatile neighbor across Junction 
Hollow to a new school (much to 
their chagrin); namely, 57 courses in 
oratory for seals, that had received 
a satisfactory preparatory education 
in Ringling Brothers justly cele
brated seminary. A new 57 varie
ties, as it were.
Another, that Drs. Esquerre and 
Marks were practicing vivisection 
upon Plebes to try out a theory of 
if a near-silver plate, containing the 
ordained number of calories, proteids, 
peptones, and pep., were hung up
on the ensanguined walls of these 
virgin stomachs, that whimsical insti
tution would soon acquire the 
ways of righteousness. Thus we 
would have, eventually, out of the 
Plebe class, candidates for the foot
ball team, who would be at least 
seven feet tall and would weigh, at a 
conservative estimate, 350 lbs. net.
Another rumorbut it is too hor
rible to contemplateThe old Bean
ery, remember, was still maintaining 
its death zone, and was daily sink
ing neutral stomachs with pie tor
pedoes and lyddite buns, launched by 
its diabolical sub-cuisine machinery. 
Illustrating, you know, a remark at
tributed to the late W. Shakespeare, 
slightly paraphrased, to the intent 
that there is more in the kitchen 
and on the festal board than your 
philosophy ever dreamed of Hora
tio.
Well, this rumor had to do with 
the coincident decline of the canine 
population of Oakland, and the man
ufacture of the munitions for this war
fare, but we must not go on.
None of these were true. It was 
just the Faculty Clubroom. Those 
wierd and unearthly noises are the 
lusty cacklings of Professor Peters 
over a little slain or over the set
ting down of the enemy on a re
doubled bid.
And when you hear reports like 
the bursting of a shrapnel shell it 
is only Professor Bergey conducting 
a game of uncensored pool after his 
own inimitable fashion.
Well, this interesting institution 
met last Monday night in sweet com
munion, the sweetness being decently 
tainted with indecent tobacco smoke. 
If you will make a rapid estimate by 
slide rule of the kind of tobacco that 
usually associates with pedagogical 
incomes you can arrive at the specific 
gravity of the atmosphere therein.
If you can stand the pace, let us 
look in on these gentlemen of lofty

there bobbing vivaciously around the 
green table, who is characterized as 
you see by a premature balditude 
and a hibernian tout ensemble (espe
cially the tout) is Willie Hoppe Mac. 
OX is rather reticent about his vir
tues as a billiardist, in fact, quite 
hates himself. He may, however, be 
heard to chirp from time to time, 
Now heres a pretty shot (accent 
on the heres). It is highly illumi
nating to watch a match between him 
and the elongated Mr. Dosey. The 
latter is so extensive in linear meas
ure that when he leans over the table 
he has to take a tuck in himself to 
keep from falling across to the floor 
beyond. On this side Professor H. 
Kiskiminetas Thayer and that emi
nent dyspeptic and pessimist, Pro
fessor Bergey are solemnly (that is 
solemnly on the part of H. K. T.s) 
engrossed over a modification of the 
ancient royal game of chess, designed 
by these gentlemen and known as 
give-away chess.
In opening this fascinating game, 
these two masters (sic) make the 
first ten moves with both hands (feet 
not barred in emergencies), the while 
keeping up an effervescent exchange 
of hand-me-down repartee.
After those first ten preordained 
moves the rest of the game is on the 
uneasy laps of the gods.
Over here is another bunch intent 
over some dilletante ceremony with 
the freckled pasteboards, known we 
believe as hearts. Think of it! And 
some of them with occipital deserts 
(at least incipient) and most of them 
with domestic limitations. As has 
been well said by Mr. H. Wagner or 
perhaps it was Mr. J. Johnson of fad
ing memory:
Genius is a step-neighbor-in-law 
of madness.
From time to time during the ap
proximate quiet, that rules during the 
taking of a cardiac inventory at the 
end of a hand, some absent-minded 
instructor not too much absorbed in 
the game, is heard to murmur great 
Caesar, 10 periods of F and 2 Ps, 
when called upon for his score. And 
by the way, this perfectly ladylike 
game with the emotional name, some
what resembles that other fascinating 
form of recreation, known as the 
Monthly Deficiency Reports.
In the former game, if we are cor
rectly informed, it is distinctly un
profitable to be left at the end of play 
with a large crop of hearts; in the 
latter it is quite as undesirable to be 
left at the end of the month or six 
weeks, with a family of orphan Fs

on yourhands. Perhaps this strik
ing resemblance led the aforemen
tioned instructor to make his little 
^lip. But let us not sadden this joy
ous occasion with such reflections. It 
is a bitter world at best.
Over here, by gosh all hemlock, is 
a real checker game. That is not a 
screen in front of the table, that is 
Judge Leeds back. Oh, yes, he has a 
head all right, but it is deeply bent 
in meditation over the board; he is 
trying to decide whether to put right 
hand or left hand English on the 
checker with which he is about to 
jump seven of his opponents men. 
He is some player, yes, sir.
And of course after all this feast of 
reason there was reason for a feast.
And, believe me, if the attendance had 
been ten per cent larger there would 
be a famine around Pittsburgh today. 
It is said that rush contracts have 
been sent to all the neighboring towns 
for the manufacture of ice cream 
(containing three per cent butter fat 
if the inspector is on his job), and 
the cub pharmacists for miles around 
have been set to putting up pepsin

Since this event professional stom
achs have organized a protective 
league, of which the celebrated chem
ist Gastrique Jews is president and
B. Man Pepsingum is travelling or
ganizer. The number of headaches 
around the institution would suggest 
slanderous reports, did we not know 
of our own observation that even the 
water was required to pass an en
trance exam. And besides no diges
tion would tamely submit to the in

Well, when there were no more 
comestibles in sight, these worthy 
brethren blessed each other and went 
peacefully home to exercise their own 
peculiar brands of nightmare. It is 
said that, at parting, Dr. Esquerre 
tried to kiss Judge Leeds on the 
cheek (embrasser we believe is the 
French for this Gallic social amenity) 
but the Judge would not stand for 
it. Besides as the timber line above 
his classic ears is rapidly descending 
toward these useful if not decorative 
appendages, he says he would at least 
like to save his whiskers.
a
COLLEGE AND FRATERNITY 
CO-OPERATION.
The Northwestern University, un
der the leadership of President Har
ris, is working out a very interesting 
experiment in dealing with college 
fraternities. Instead of ignoring them 
or attempting to suppress them, it is 
trying the policy of regulation. It 
has supervised the expenditure of 
$500,000 on a quadrangle of fraternity 
houses and non-fraternity dormi
tories.
The land has been given by the col
lege for the use of these buildings, 
and the non-fraternity dormitories 
have been built at the expense of the 
college. The fraternity houses were 
built by the members, graduates and 
undergraduates, of the fraternities, 
the University helping them to se
cure credit; the title for all the prop
erty remains in the institution. The 
complete plans call for six quad
rangles, so arranged with reference to 
one another that they shall form one 
large quadrangle, on grounds over
looking Lake Michigan. The build
ings are to be harmonious in mate
rial and design. They are built of 
brick in the Florentine style, and in 
the center of each quadrangle is a 
sunken grass court.
When President Harris went to 
Northwestern University, he tells us, 
he found a number of National fra
ternities and some local clubs. Most 
of them were paying rent, and were 
located in various parts of Evanston; 
none of the chapters owned their own
homes. They were small in numbers; 
and they were too much given to so
cial activities. President Harris be
lieves that wherever people are 
thrown together groups will be form
ed by natural gravitation. The fra
ternities were imbedded in the Uni
versity; and, instead of antagonizing 
them, it seemed to him wise to utilize 
their strength nad enthusiasm for the 
good of the University and of the 
students. The solution of the quad
rangle of fraternity houses adjoining 
non-fraternity dormitories, where all 
the men would live together under the 
same circumstances, offered itself. 
Both classes of students are now 
constantly thrown under the same 
material conditions; their expenses 
have been greatly reduced, as a years 
experience with one of the quad
rangles has shown; and, President 
Harris believes, the spirit of a broad 
and true democracy has been greatly 
fostered. In his judgment, the plant
ing of the fraternities in permanent 
homes, the University holding the 
title, has not only cut down the ex
pense, but has enlarged the chapters, 
improved the discipline of the insti
tution, and largely removed the ten
dencies towards exclusiveness and 
snobbishness which have been devel
oped in some cases under the frater
nity system. The endeavor is being 
made to foster a strong social feel
ing in the non-fraternity houses, so 
that when the alumni return they will 
feel at home in the houses in which 
they formerly lived, precisely as the 
fraternity alumni feel.
The Outlook.
BASKET BALL SCHEDULE

far the most difficult and the best 
schedule ever undertaken by this in
stitution in that sport.
It will be noticed that one long 
trip will be taken north and east. One 
other short trip will also probably be 
arranged.
The schedule follows:
January 7Westinghouse Club.
