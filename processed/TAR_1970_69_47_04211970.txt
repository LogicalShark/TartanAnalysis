Variance Hearing
The Alle^rieny County Board 
of Air Pollution Appeals and 
Variance Review has scheduled 
public hearings on April 27th 
and May 4th for over 200 re
quests from companies and com
munities seeking exemptions 
from the county's new air pol
lution control laws.
The County's Health Depart
ment has toughened its poli
cies and increased its jurisdic
tion so that it now may also 
hold steel corporations subject 
to Health Department air pol
lution regulations. Last April 17, 
the first anti-steel action in the 
department history was taken, 
slapping the U.S. Steel Corpor
ation and the Pittron Corpora
tion of Glassport with fines 
totalling a staggering $351.00.
Commenting on the fines, Act
ing Head of the Health Depart
ment, Dr. Frank B. Clack, said.
 The blanket exemption granted 
the steel industry under the old 
smoke control laws has expired 
and we re starting a new ball 
game.'
Reacting to the new  tough 
policy. U.S. Steel and Jones and 
Laughlin Steel will be among 
the corporations heard on Mon
day. May 4th, seeking appeals 
for exemptions from County air 
pollution control laws.
The hearings are open to the 
public and provide an excellent 
opportunity for those sympa
thetic to the message of the En
vironmental Teach-In to take the 
positive participatory action ne
cessary if ecological concern is 
to go beyond its present stage of 
rhetoric.
The County's Bureau of Air 
Pollution Control at 281-4900 
should provide information con
cerning where the April 27th 
and May 4th hearings will be 
heard.
Spiros Special Students
Vice President Spiro Agnew 
said recently that a natural 
aristocracy" of the best stu
dents in the United States 
should be given special treat
ment by the school system to 
nurture and to advance that 
natural aristocracy through the 
rigorous demands of intellectual competition." He criticized 
the universities that disregarded 
their admission requirements 
to achieve racial and economic 
balances on their campuses.
Agnew said that the special 
students were being wasted when 
required to study with the less 
able students in their schools.
State Threatens 
To Refuse Aid 
To 11 Colleges
The Pennsylvania Higher Edu
cation Assistance Agency threat
ened recently to terminate fin
ancial aid to students at 11 col
leges which have refused to sign 
an agreement to report campus 
disrupters to the state.
Ten out-of-state schools have 
refused to sign the agreement. 
Haverford College is the only 
Pennsylvania institution which 
did not conform with the pro
vision.
The stipulation, inserted by 
the legislature last year into two 
student aid bills, would require 
that colleges and universities re
ceiving state aid for their stu
dents report all campus dis
rupters. whether they are aid 
recipients or not. to the state. 
These students would then be 
denied further financial assist
ance.
While only eleven institutions 
refused to sign the agreement. 
29 colleges signed the agree
ment under protest. CarnegieMellon was among 18 Penn
sylvania schools to sign under 
protest.
Haverford College president 
John Coleman, in refusing to 
sign the agreement stated that 
the school "has clear under
standings with our students 
that our disciplinary procedures 
are internal matters.
BLACK WEEK
The week of April 20th through April 28th has been proclaimed 
Black Week by Spirit. There will be talks, films, song, and dance. 
We of Spirit wish to make it clear that Black Week was not planned 
to bring Black and White together. Rather it was planned as an en
tertaining experience; an exhibition of what Black people are about, 
as well as some of the things Spirit has done. It should be an enjoy
able week for both the Black community and Whites who choose to 
attend the events. All are invited.

regarding course selections for 
the Fall Semester 1970. and also 
to give academic departments 
information regarding course 
demands, the Educational Pol
icy Council; on March 9th. 
voted the following:
All presently enrolled day 
undergraduate and day graduate 
students who pl^n to return for 
the fall semester must complete 
the academic portion of regis
tration during a day this spring.
The implementation of the above 
procedures is as follows:
1. Schedules of classes will be 
available in academic depart
ments during the week of Ap
ril 20 - 24.
2. Academic departments will
be set up in the gymnasium 
to handle course section en
rollment on Wednesday, April 
29. between the hours of 1 and 
5 p.m. and 6:15 p.m. to 
9p.m.
3. Since no provision has been 
made for cancelling classes 
on this day. students will ne
cessarily have to individually

a) securing of four approved 
schedule cards from depart
ment advisor who will re
tain one schedule card.
b) appearance into the gym
nasium where section enroll
ment will be completed.
4. In addition to the approved

not be necessary to have these 
master cards changed for this 
process.
5. At the end of the pre-regis
tration line, photographs will 
be taken and signatures ob

EditorialLETTERS TO THE EDITOR
For years I have listened to professors, especially human
ities professors, gripe and bemoan the lack of motivation and 
interest displayed by their students. I dont know how many 
articles Ive read in which educators harped on the sense of 
futility they felt when trying to teach the co-ed, in college 
to catch a husband, or the frat man, majoring in beer with a 
minor in classes, or the engineer, taking the course because 
he needs the credit. About the time I was applying to college, 
this professional penchant for crying in ones beer had reach
ed the level of a chorus.
Because of this, I view the actions of the H&SS faculty, 
with regard to their students request for more freedom in 
their curriculum, as both pathetic and hypocritical.
Confronted with a group of highly motivated, highly in
dividualistic students, the facultys response has been one of 
obstructionism rather than encouragement, reluctance rather 
than relish. In general, the faculty seems to be taking the 
position of: Its my ball, and if I dont get to be captain, 
nobody plays.
Ultimately, the H&SS faculty will have to realize that 
once the students have questioned the ability of the faculty 
to guide their education (which is their duty, to question), 
then the very act of dictating a plan of study undermines 
the mutual respect relationship required for further progress.
The only way independence of thought and self realiza
tion can be imparted to a student (and I assume and hope 
that is at least one of the goals of the college) is by making 
the student responsible for his own direction. That means 
false directions too.
These students, by and large, are more than capable of 
shaping coherent plans for themselves, and to continue to 
treat them as if they cannot be trusted to do this is to deny 
their individuality and responsibility for themselves.

The response to my becoming editor of this paper has 
generally taken only two forms:
- people come up to me and congratulate me, usually 
with intonations of either trepidation, bewilderment, or 
Pity;
- I am told that so-and-so is convinced that the paper is 
going to turn into a rabid, frothing at the mouth radical 
rag (this is usually followed by dark murmurings of impeachment, cutting off of funds, etc.)
To all those whose response falls in the first category,
I say thank-you. To those whose response falls in the second 
category, I can only regret your closed-mindedness. My pri
mary ambition is to get this paper read by its community, 
not subvert its morals as you may believe.
To those who are capable of some kind of response to 
this paper (a warm body temperature, movement of the eyes, 
a pulse beat, a desire to communicate with ones fellow man)
I wish to inform you that we need staff. We have the core 
of a good staff. It needs flesh. We need reporters, writers, 
copy staff, layout people, typists, mascots, hangers-on, and 
many more. If youre interested in trying to change this 
place from a cerebral watering trough into a community, con
tact us.

One quick warning especially for chicks, now that the 
weather is warm. Be careful when you go into the parks at 
night. Dont go alone. Attacks are common. There are plenty 
of guys around willing to escort you.

The upcoming democratic pri
mary represents an. unfortunately 
all too rare event - a choice be
tween two good candidates in
stead of the usual choice of the 
lesser of two evils. As such the 
choice is not only difficult but 
important. Though both men can 
be expected to cast their single 
votes in a similar way their im
pact and influence on others - 
on Congress, on Pittsburgh, on 
black and on white - will be very 
different. It is on this difference 
that a choice must be made.
I'd like to comment here on 
two related issues that are to me 
the most significant; race and 
leadership.
At first glance it might seem 
that the democratic" thing to 
do would be to disregard the 
irrelevant'' difference of race. 
This might be correct if we 
were simply considering the in
dividual abilities of the men. 
but we are not. The questions 
here are of much greater signi
ficance. (I said might be be
cause its my opinion that if a 
black man has made it in the 
white world w o giving up his 
blackness he's gotta be a hell
uva individual. If a black and a 
white are at comparable posi
tions in our society the black 
man would seem to be the su
perior of the two for he has 
had to overcome the greater 
obstacles.
Black people must become 
part of the political system; 
first both for the power itself 
and second for the intangible, 
but no less important fact that 
these individuals would be 
models that other black people 
can proudly identify with. It 
was not too long ago that the 
only black people a black child 
ever saw in the mdeia or in 
public life were either the stereo
typed janitors or ingratiating 
Uncle Toms. That such stereo
types wreck havoc on black 
children's self-image is an es
tablished psychological fact.
Further the importance of black 
people getting political power 
can hardly be overestimated. 
The economic gap between 
black and white is still increas
ing and would be increasing 
at a far greater rate if not for 
the efforts of blacks themselves 
working from a politically and 
economically impoverished pow
er base. This trend must not only 
be stopped but reversed. Nixon s 
retreat from a strong civil rights
stand and the generally con
servative mood of the country 
indicates clearly that signifi
cant help from white politi
cians is not forthcoming in the 
near future. Consequently, the 
political power of blacks must 
be substantially increased if 
they are ever to achieve mean
ingful equality.
Thus for me using the criterea of race the choice between 
these two seemingly equal indi
viduals was an easy one. I simp
ly chose the black man. To those 
of you who might accuse me of 
being a racist in reverse let 
me point out that a racist is an 
individual who uses the criteria 
of race in an irrational and ir
relevant manner, and it is my 
contention that at this time in 
our history some favoritism to
wards blacks is both eminently 
rational and relevant with res
pect to the welfare of our so
ciety.
Further, not to select the black 
in preference to the white could 
more justifiably be considered 
the racist attitude, for it ignores 
the barriers and hurdles the 
black man had to overcome that 
the white can hardly imagine 
let alone experience. Let s be 
democratic when we make our 
decision? No. let s be just! In 
that way we will be working to 
make the system really demo
cratic and not hypocritically ap
plying the principle of demo
cracy when it works to our ad
vantage.
The situation seems to me to 
be entirely analogous to an ab
surd race between a shackled 
and a free man. Would it be 
undemocratic to shorten the dis
tance for the shackled man? 
And would the free man be 
justified in complaining that to 
do so would be undemocratic, 
especially if it was he who had 
applied the shackles in the first 
place' (Nor is the argument 
that I'm not responsible for the 
sins of my father'' applicable 
here. The unique economic, so
cial, and political hardships 
that black people have to en
dure are here with us today 
If you dont take a stand, if you 
bury your head in the sand and 
self-righteously cry democracy 
then you are responsible. For 
by your inaction you will have 
helped to perpetuate injustices.)
But let's turn now to the se
cond issue, that of leadership. 
A difference in ability exists 
between these candidates on 
this dimension and it is a dif
ference that is crucial in our 
times. It is clear that both men 
are leaders - Moorhead is a 
Congressman and Byrd Brown is 
President of Pittsburgh chapter 
of the NAACP. But there are
degrees of leadership ability. in 
12 years in Congress Congress
man Moorhead has a good vot
ing record but his has been a 
single vote - his influence on 
his fellow legislators has not 
been impressive. He has never 
initiated nor sponsored a piece 
of major social legislation thatli 
successfully passed thru the 
House. Back in Pittsburgh Con
gressman Moorhead by his own 
admitted decision has not taken 
a leadership role. I agree with 
his statement that we elect a 
Congressman to represent us in 
Washington but I'm quite sure 
that he realizes that that is not 
the whole story. In our political 
system an elected representative ^ 
uses his official political base 
to extend his unofficial power. 
That this is done in petty, sel
fish ways is well recognized but 
it is perhaps not as obvious 
that this is the way our political 
system works. Thus, Congres
sional issues are not decided 
purely on their ability. In fact, 
that is what is meant by poli
tical decisions" Congressman 
Moorhead knows that if he want
ed to he could exert consider
able political influence on 
events in Pittsburgh. By deny
ing this role he is shirking an 
important unofficial responsibil
ity. It is relatively easy to per
form the official function of 
voting, what is far more diffi
cult is to perform the unofficial j 
but far more important function 
of exerting leadership and in
fluence on other Congressman 
and on events in Pittsburgh. Byrd 
Brown has pledged himself to 
carrying out this responsibility 
and has demonstrated his capa
city to do so wo the power 
base available to a Congressman.
Finally, there is a difference 
in political philosophy between {>
the two men which I believe is 
not as slight as has been assum
ed. Moorhead is a liberal follow
er. Byrd Brown is a militant 
black leader. He is impatient, 
he is hungry for change. Suc
cess is as much due to motiva
tion as it is to ability.
This country is drifting slow
ly but perceptibly towards re*
pression. Liberal followers can 
not stop this trend only militant 
leaders can - but only if they 
do so from w i the system, from 
a base of official political pow
er. At a time when a recent na
tional survey found that a ma
jority of Americans would favor 
restricting five of the first ten 
amendments men like Bvrd 
Brown must be elected to na1
tional political offices.

K
H.&S.S. Council Fails To Satisfy
Alter much analysis and discussion, the Korn proposal was retined to the following statement of principle, which was approved
12 to 3.
A required curriculum lor H&SS students embodying area 
requirements shall be established. These requirements may be 
fulfilled at any time during a student's four years at CMU. al
though students will br advised to complete them during their 
first two years.
An H&SS curriculum committee or committees shal be esblished.
A student may be excused from any requirement by demon
strating to the committee that he has sufficient competence in 
that area.
Any student, in consultation with a faculty advisor chosen 
by the student, may propose a variance from the required curri
culum. The rationale behind the variance and how it fits in to 
the student s over-all plan tor his own education will be evalu
ated and either accepted or rejected by the committee.
The Council agreed that Professor Lasunan would suggest re
visions at the next meeting to improve the adequacy and reada
bility of the statement and that the next meeting would be devoted 
to filling in the necessary detail on how the philosophy would be 
implemented.
Erwin R. Steinberg 
Ed. Note: The following letter was sent to, the H&SS and MMCC 
College Council by Student Government President Patrick Cavanagh.
Your actions of April 9. have been in direct disregard of the 
needs and desires of the H&SS students. The retainment of area re
quirements ensures the perpetuation of the petty course requirement/ 
examination system that distorts education into a meaningless game. 
This system is an insult to students, and yet you have chosen to ig
nore their requests  originating from both the H&SS freshmen and 
the Student Senate. It is obvious that the College Council has failed 
to be a workable mechanism of communication. If the Council con
tinues in its present trend, it is questionable whether student repre
sentation on the Council can serve any useful purpose.
Patrick Cavanagh 
President. Student Government
I am saddened and angered as I watch the H&SS College Council repeat the mistakes made by 
other universities over the past several years. While largely intelligent and ethical men and women, 
they have shown themselves to be unable to understand the nature of the student attending this universitv.of the values and goals under which he lives. It is clear to me that today's student, coming to
this university wTith a broader and more comprehensive high school background than ever before, is 
capable of fashioning his own education from the fabric of the university curriculum (and is. in fact, 
the only one able to). It is equally clear that the enterprising student, versed in the art of deception 
since kindergarten, will continue to avoid undesirable requirements through the many means known to 
anyone involved with an educational institution. The College Council is well aware of this, and so they 
otter us an insulting tokenism which will make it slightly easier to squeeze out of requirements and 
slightly less painful to fulfill them. I want to be part of a university which facilitates and encourages 
growth and diversity, rather than begrudgingly allowing a sense of freedom and of self to exist despite 
their conviction that they know what is best for us. To me. it is this call for a college based upon the 
principles of trust, independence and communication between individuals on both an informational and 
personal level that is the meaning of the following statement of protest by New College Freshmen.
Mark Fromm
As students of the new college we are dismayed and appalled by the H&SS College Councils failure to 
respond realistically or fairly to what we have clearly described as our needs and educational goals. The fact that 
the council can happily accept an area requirement proposal so similar to the administrations original plan and
so obviously unsatisfactory to our student representatives (the vote was 12 to three12 faculty members and deans
opposed by all three student representatives), the fact that the Council can summarily dismiss a no requirements 
experiment proposal endorsed by the Student Senate (31$1) and by the overwhelming majority of the Freshman 
Class, indicates more strongly than ever the ultimate failure of the Council as a representative or workable me
chanism for decision-making. We have learned through this experience that the Council will respond only to pres
sure of an intense and constant nature. We pledge ourselves to a continuing struggle for our rights as students and
for a truly educational community based upon mutual respect and responsbiveness to individual needs.

Senate Wades Onward
by Dave Caney
Student Senate met last week, 
as usual, in the Wherret Room 
at 4:30. April 14. and. surpris
ingly. got a lot of work done.
Highlights of the committee 
reports were as follows:
- Pat Cavanagh reported that 
the student insurance policies 
were being re-evaluated, especi
ally with respect to maternity 
benef its for unwed mothers.
Cavanagh also announced a 
proposal to give a per student 
proportion of the activities fee 
over to each constituant organi
zation (M.D.C.. AW.S., and 
graduate and commuter organi
zations which would have to be 
formed i ol the student body. 
These groups would then plan 
and execute then own activities 
programs instead of having to 
work through senate. Les Polgar
pointed out that the glacial 
-apathy of the graduates and com
muters would have to be over
come if the proposal is to work.
- John Messervy reported that 
the library was losing $8.000 a 
year in books and 40 percent
ol their new acquisitions. The 
committee he is working with 
i> considering a magnetic tape 
detection system.
- Ken Friend reported on the 
H & SS meeting (see above.
Under old business, the new 
senate Constitution was pre
sented. The gist of the changes 
involved are the abolishment of 
the presidential and executive 
council vetoes, and the policy 
of enacting senate resolutions 
immediateh rather than the previoush two week wait.
A tepid debate followed which 
ended in the senate defeating
a motion by Marcel Weiner to 
support giving meals to all ath
letes during their respective sea
sons. The senate did. however, 
endorse setting up a committee 
to study the role of varsity 
sports at C-MU.
Two motions under new busi
ness. that a fund of $4.000 be 
established within the Activities 
Board for organizations not with
in the Activities Board, and that 
the general campus committee
ol student senate conduct an in
vestigation of the housing situ
ation. both from Steve Borth. 
were tabled
Next weeks meeting is on

AE Phis first place sorority booth.
'Crazy Contraptions'-And Then Some
Another Spring Carnival 
has come and gone on the 
Tech Campus and as usual 
it was filled with unusual 
events and unpredictable 
happenings. We all owe a 
special thanks to Jimmy 
Jacks for ordering three days 
of Florida sunshine in the 
middle of April to Pittsburgh, 
of all places.
On the Midway, the crazziest contraption, of all prov
ed to be Tau Delta Phis 
oversized erector set com
plete with a backwards game. 
A E Phi won the sorority 
booth competition with their 
two-seated backscratcher.
The three most "inter
esting events of the week
end were, as usual. Faculty 
Egg Toss, Sorority Relays, 
and Plank Joust. Apparently 
the members of the CMU 
faculty spent less time dur
ing the 1969-1970 academic 
year making mistakes. The 
only explanation for the
240 foot toss of Spring Car
nival 1969 would be that the 
Physics Department team 
spent much of their time 
wadding papers and tossing 
them in the circular file. The 
nearly errorless Mechanical 
Engineers took over this 
year with a throw of 108 
feet. Meanwhile Kappa Al
pha Theta parlayed news
papers, ping-pong balls, and 
baseball bats into a first 
place trophy in the relay 
races and the plank-joust
ing event lacked water and 
plank but enthusiasm and 
dirty bodies peaked during 
Carnival 1970.
Buggy Sweepstakes offered 
the most excitement as usual. 
Friday Phi Kappa Theta 
ran two fine buggies only 
to be thwarted by the *ATO 
Syndrome, no brakes. Ed 
Berbari and the DU Door 
did what was undoubtedly 
the finest public relations 
job for buggy races seen on
Beta pusher strains in Fridays qualifying competition.
Police officer approaches scene of consolation heat accident. SAEs driver and bike is on left while Tau 
Delts bike is on the right in front of the follow car. The mishap occurred when ATOs buggy (not 
shown) hit the back wheel of Tau Delts bike while attempting to pass on the free roll. SAEs bike, 
swerved and went out of control. No one was seriously hurt.
this campus in years. Frew 
Street was responsible for 
times as slow as four min
utes, 10 seconds, with the 
fastest time this year about 
five and a half seconds off 
Pikas record 2:20.9. The 
Fringe buggy ran a nonchal
ant slalom course on the 
free roll while members of 
its push team sought advice 
from competing pushers as to 
the nature of the exchange 
lanes during Heat two on 
opening day.
The championship and 
consolation-heats on Satur
day provided a combination 
of events not easily forgot
ten. In the consolation Heat.
Alpha Tau Omegas Golden 
Goose" ran ashore before 
the island in an attempt to 
pass Tau Delt and SAE. re
sulting in a two-bike-onebuggy smashup. Fortunately, 
no one sustained serious 
injury. Beta Theta Pi had 
the opportunity of running 
two buggies in the finals 
heat after a fine show on 
Friday, but lost nonetheless

in a neck and neck free 
roll and back hills battle 
with Pikas buggy. Finally. 
Harold Herre advertised 
that the handkerchief he 
used during brake tests was
clean, despite its appear
ance. but had undergone 
much use during the process 
of testing the buggy stop
pers. topping Sweepstakes 
70 with an aura of humor.

Betits Jukebox-Sitting Rights Subvert!
Like sight for a blind man 
Like sound for a deaf man 
Like music for Pittsburgh . . . 
man.
The old building sits defiant
ly at the end of Broad Mall 
amidst a series of shops, stores 
and pedestrian walkways in newly-renovated East Liberty. Its 
painted white front smiles down 
at you. proclaiming in big Amer
ican Flag letters  SMAP  Sun>hine. Music. America. Peace. 
Old Glory waves freely over
head in the cool breeze that 
carries some heavy music down 
to your head from the open sec
ond story window.
These were my impressions of 
Pittsburgh's newest rock concert 
hall. SMAP. finally reborn from 
the old Electric Theater which 
closed a deafen ingly silence a 
year ago. due to various rea
sons. As I tripped up the dark
ened stairs to the incensed big 
black hall above. I began to no
tice that the physical character
istics of the building hadn't 
changed as much as the atmos
phere: it was more relaxed, more 
informal and much more friendly than it had been last year as a 
small carbon copy business en
terprise of other halls across the 
country (Phillv's Electric Fac
tory.' New York s Electric Cir
cus." the Electric Theatre." 
etc. i Gone are the men in plas
tic-hip clothes, the promoters, 
the stone face police, the mon
ey-makers. They may be behind 
the scenes helping out. but they 
have been replaced at the doors 
and ticket booths by a group of 
smiling, hairy freaks who now 
run everything from promotion 
and legalities to the light show. 
These are SMAP s people, whose 
common dedication to providing 
the impetus for a long overdue 
Pittsburgh rock renaissance keeps 
them working and hoping that 
they can inject some life into 
this citys numb musical vein. 
This idealism is the distinct 
characteristic of SMAP which 
separates it from past attempts 
by various people to establish 
rock halls for basically monetary 
reasons. Unfortunately, you can't 
run a business enterprise on 
ideals alone, either, and I hope 
that SMAP will not sink slow
ly into the polluted AM sunset, 
accompanied by a chorus of teeny-boppers singing "Sugar. Su
gar." T' would be a horrible 
fate, indeed. But this time 
around should be different, be
cause SMAP is giving people a 
chance to clean the bubble-gum 
out of their ears and get a taste 
of music that is something more 
than a processed, commercializ
ed. studio musician-performed 
piece of hipocrisy.
Please support SMAP so that 
they can bring more good music 
to you for years to come. Rare 
Earth. Pacific Gas. Dreams. 
Lighthouse and John Mayall 
have filled SMAP's hall with 
their sounds, as well as local
groups like Steamshovel and 
Mind Garages, who do fantastic 
warm-up shows. Enjoy a good 
light show and the best accoustics in town: come in out of the 
smog and breathe in softly$incensed air. Relax. Listen. It's a 
giant leap from sitting on top of 
the Skibo jukebox on weekends. 
Who knows, you might get to 
shake John Mayall's hand or 
something.
(CPSi"We hold these truths 
to be self-evident, that all men 
are created equal, that they are
endowed by their creator with 
certain inalienable rights, that 
among these are life, liberty, 
and the pursuit of happiness."
The above portion of the Dec
laration of Independence was re
cently read to 252 American GIs 
at a base in West Germany, in 
an experiment conducted by the 
University of Maryland's over
seas division. The soldiers were 
asked to sign if they agreed.
Not having been told where 
the quote came from, the GIs
were wary. Seventy, three per 
cent of them refused to sign the 
statement because they were 
afraid it was subversive.
