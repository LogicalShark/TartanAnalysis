Students make way 
up to the Summit
SARAH MOGIN
Editor-in-Chief
Four days before the semes
ter began, while many Carnegie 
Mellon students were relishing 
what remained of their vaca
tions, about 300 others were 
already back in class. These were 
the attendees of Summit 2008, a 
three-day program offering doz
ens of diverse classes taught by 
students, Carnegie Mellon fac
ulty, and local professionals.
[Summit] gives you time to do 
the stuff youve always wanted 
to do, said Aneeb Qureshi, the 
president of Summit.
Leaving Differential Equa
tions or Interpretive Practices 
for the school year, students at 
Summit are able to take more 
esoteric classes, from knitting to 
gun shooting and anime draw
ing to personal finance.
The quality of each class 
was improved [from last year], 
Qureshi said. He added that 
classes this year had an 80 
percent participation rate, the 
highest in Summits history.
In an effort to make classes 
more appealing, Qureshi and 
Summits other leaders looked 
at the class evaluations from 
previous years, replacing classes 
that no one liked with options 
they hoped would be more suc
cessful.
Gun shooting, one of this 
years new additions, was a pop
ular attraction.
It was a huge hit, said soph
omore Amandeep Chawla, a 
double major in MechE and BME 
who attended Summit for the 
first time this year.
I was [at the range] for a
long time, said Chawla, who 
had never fired a gun before 
Summit.
Second-time attendee Lauren 
Krukar also tried her hand at 
gun shooting, but she found that 
the kayaking class (held in the 
UC pool) took her the most out 
of her element.
Its something I probably 
would have never done on my 
own, said Krukar, a sophomore 
majoring in ECE and EPP.
I decided to take totally dif
ferent experiences, she said. 
Krukar found that even quilting, 
which she took for the second 
year in a row, covered different 
techniques than last year.
Summit 2008 also changed 
to accommodate Odyssey, a 
new leadership program for 
sophomores sponsored by the 
Office of Undergraduate Re
search and Fellowships. Summit 
and Odyssey students ate their 
meals together, an arrange
ment that had its plusses and 
minuses.
Having to accommodate 
Odyssey students reduced 
Summits overall capacity, a 
number primarily determined 
by the eating space in Rangos, 
Qureshi said.
Still, some Summit students 
enjoyed socializing with Odyssey 
members, Chawla said, includ
ing himself in that description.
People are willing to make 
friends, he added, comparing 
Summit to a less-confusing ver
sion of Orientation.
Summit began in 2005 as a 
project of fifth-year scholar stu
dent Roger Ma, who aimed to

A newly released study is 
debunking the myth that men 
are attaining college degrees 
at a higher rate than women. 
The most recent U.S. Census 
Bureau report on educational 
attainment reported that in the 
past five years the number of 
women with college degrees 
has increased by 1.2 percent, 
while the number of men has 
decreased by 1 percent.
How significant is 1 per
cent? asked Yasaswi Raparla, 
a first-year ECE major. We are 
steadily increasing the number 
of people we have from a popula
tion to go to college, so a drop of 
I percent for one demographic 
is holistically insignificant.
Grace DeForest, a senior 
mathematics major and sta
tistics teaching assistant, 
addressed Raparlas questions.
While a 1 percent drop is not 
significant in itself, it is defi
nitely something to look to as a 
possible trend for the future, 
said DeForest.
The number of men with 
college degrees still surpasses 
women; 30 percent of men have 
degrees, compared to 28 per
cent of women.
DeForest suggested that the 
study would have been more 
effective if it had addressed 
women who had recently been 
accepted and were planning 
to enroll in colleges, instead of 
simply looking at graduation 
rates.
However, as DeForest pointed 
out, the new data reported by 
the survey have the potential to 
change these figures.
The negative trend in men 
has been attributed to factors 
such as feminized classrooms, 
according to a recent article in 
The Chicago Sun-Times. In gen
eral, this theory dictates that 
classrooms call for orderly and 
quiet conduct with an empha
sis on cooperation, and young 
boys entering the educational 
plane are often ostracized due 
to their desire to work indepen
dently. On the other hand, the 
number of women succeeding 
in higher education has drasti
cally increased, maybe because 
college provides a conducive 
learning environment, the ar
ticle suggested.
Hilary Baribeau, a first-year 
H&SS student, suggested fe
male empowerment as the main 
cause for the increasing trend in 
females with degrees.
I think that because of
women empowerment move
ments, women have been 
pushed to do better and com
pete with men, Baribeau said. 
In todays world, the standards 
have risen for women, so they 
are more compelled to exert 
themselves in higher education 
today than they have been in the 
past; however, no such move
ment has occurred for males to 
further push themselves. 
DeForest, president of Strong 
Women, Strong Girls, agreed 
with Baribeau.
I think that women have 
learned not just that they can 
handle college, but rather that 
it is there as a viable option for 
them, she said.
Baribeau attributes the lack of 
motivation for men to do better 
as a big contributor to their stag
nant trend in attaining degrees.
Men are traditionally more 
likely to have higher wages than 
women, said Baribeau. So they 
are not being pushed to increase 
their personal standards. 
Raparla echoes the idea of 
gender-driven motivation.
Younger women can see 
that they now have more op
portunities, he said, So they 
see that they can also make a

Reuniting 
people 
through 
lost gloves
ELLEN TWORKOSKI
Junior Staffwriter
At this time of year, misplaced 
gloves are a common issue, one 
that Jennifer Gooch, a gradu
ate student in the School of Art, 
has been trying to remedy. For a 
recent art project, she created a 
website designed to reunite lost 
gloves with their owners. Titled 
One Cold Hand? the website 
contains over 170 pictures of 
abandoned gloves found around 
the city of Pittsburgh.
Goochs project has sparked 
national and global interest and 
has been covered by BBC, CNN, 
The New York Times, USA Today, 
and National Public Radio.
Gooch said the website is 
designed to allow abandoned ob
jects to recover their usefulness. 
She sees her project as an inter
esting metaphor for the lives of 
people, many of whom are con
tinually searching for the perfect 
soulmate.
Although Gooch recognizes 
that the ultimate availability of 
connection is not always there 
for people and their mates, it is 
a definite possibility when ex
tending the metaphor to gloves 
objects which are guaranteed to 
have one perfect match.
Its like an online dating ser
vice for long lost gloves, wrote 
USA Today in a December article.
Although the website has not 
had instantaneous results, Gooch 
has already had seven successful 
reunions since the beginning of 
winter and looks to continue col
lecting gloves.
To facilitate the process, Gooch 
has installed drop-boxes at both 
the UC Information Desk and the 
College of Fine Arts art office, as 
well as at several Pittsburgh busi
nesses.
Many students are excited at 
the prospect of Goochs project.
It sounds like a great idea, 
said Jessica Len, a junior business 
major who has visited the site 
and heard about it in the national 
news.
Len pointed out that publicity 
and marketing are keys in mak
ing the website a success.
To help promote awareness of 
her site, Gooch created stickers 
for glove finders to leave in the 
place of a recovered glove. The 
stickers have the projects website 
address printed on them so that

Campus celebrates Martin 
Luther King Jr. Day of Service
events last through the evening 
with the wrap-up of local service 
activities.
Our decision to hold classes in 
the morning is due to our belief 
that Martin Luther King Jr. Day 
creates a unique opportunity for 
A Day On, Not A Day Off, a motto 
for the day nationally, said Anne 
Witchner, assistant dean of Stu
dent Affairs.
Witchner spoke of the univer
sitys worry that the complete 
cancellation of classes would di
minish student participation and 
detract from the days events. 
With just a half day, the major
ity of students are already on 
campus.
Zenobia Bell, a junior social 
and decisions sciences major and 
the committee head of SPIRIT, 
echoedher support of the half-day 
implementation.
I know most schools either 
start school after the day or have 
the day off, Bell said, but realis
tically, I dont think many people 
would participate if there were
no classes that day.
The University of Pittsburgh, 
Carlow University, and Duquesne 
University schedules all include a 
full day of observance, canceling 
classes for todays holiday.
While Witchner admitted 
that this is not a decision taken 
lightly by the administration, she 
said that it continues to be as
sured by the engagement of our 
community that this is indeed a 
fitting way to honor Dr. King. 
Gina Casalegno, director of 
Student Activities, spoke of Presi
dent Jared L. Cohons support.
As opposed to a day off, Dr. 
Cohon believes strongly that this 
holiday presents an opportunity 
for a day on when students, 
faculty, staff, and community 
members can come together to 
celebrate, she said.
With countless opportunities 
available, there are more than 
enough chances for students to 
truly take this day on.

NSF awards grant to professor
Carnegie Mellon professor Jacobo 
Bielakwas awarded $1.6 million by the 
National Science Foundation PetaApps 
program to help reduce seismic risks 
by developing earthquake computer 
simulations.
For over 10 years, Bielak, a professor 
of civil and environmental engineering, 
in conjunction with David OHallaron, 
a professor of computer science and 
electrical engineering, has led a team 
of researchers from several campuses 
of the University of California in de
veloping important computer models 
of earthquake behavior that push the 
limits of existing technology.
His research will provide much 
needed details as to how urban envi
ronments behave in large earthquakes 
and reveal what is necessary to im
prove disaster.
Creating such models should
simulate how important infrastructures 
of an urban city such as buildings and 
bridges will be impacted and provide 
key information as to how to build 
them.
In collaboration with researchers at 
the Southern California Earthquake 
Center, Bielak and OHallaron have 
produced realistic 3-Dmodels of basin 
geology as well as the sources and 
ground motion of earthquakes.
This team, using special algorithms 
and simulation structures, and with 
continued collaboration, hopes to 
further improve their projection of 
earthquakes and with it public safety.
This ongoing research project is 
meant to create an accurate picture of 
earthquakes and use this information 
to build infrastructures in a way that 
will least likely result in catastrophe.
Boss takes charge in Las Vegas
Carnegie Mellons Tartan Racing 
Team continues to make headlines. 
Last November, Boss, the teams sport 
utility vehicle, won the DARPA Urban 
Challenge. The award came with a $2 
million prize and national and interna
tional media attention.
Last week, Boss arrived in Las Vegas 
for the annual Consumer Electronics 
Show, where thousands of people and 
members of the press came to see the 
unveiling of the latest technological 
advancements.
Boss stood out amid the latest 
thin-panel TV screens, video note
pads, smart car designs, and other 
high-technology products.
Rick Wagoner, the CEO of General 
Motors, gave a speech at the show, shar
ing his companys plans to invest millions 
to develop a car inspired by Boss. General 
Motors ideal car will prevent accidents
by braking and accelerating on its own.
In anticipation of the conference, Boss 
appeared in television and in print. On 
NBCs The Today Show, the world saw 
A1 Roker climb into the vehicle in which 
he was robotically chauffeured around a 
parking lot.
The vehicle went on to appear on CBS 
Evening News and The Early Show, where 
correspondent Daniel Sieberg took a spin 
similar to Rokers.
Boss was also covered recently in The 
Wall Street Journal and The New York 
Times in discussion of Wagoners upcom
ing speech and General Motors plans.

With the culmination of the 
choral tribute by music and 
drama students, President Cohon will officially open the day 
with his annual state of diver
sity address. He is expected to 
speak on diversity in student 
enrollment, faculty, and uni
versity staff while highlighting 
both progress and areas to im
prove upon.
His address will set the tone 
for the day to come.
At 1:30 p.m., local high school 
students and Carnegie Mellon 
students will be reading their 
personal works on racial expe
riences, cultural identity, and 
reflection on civil rights. These 
students, all recipients of the 
Martin Luther King Jr. Writing 
Awards, will be honored by the 
university.
Other activities on campus 
include a candlelight procession 
and a community discussion on 
environmental justice, in addi
tion to activities for children.
The art gallery will host a 
puppet show and an art exhibit 
from local fourth graders, em
phasizing the importance of 
childrens awareness of the day, 
according to Witchner.
Just honoring Martin Luther 
King Jr. should be enough to get 
people motivated, Bell said.
Beyond the University Cen
ter, buses will be departing
from the turnaround all day to 
various service projects around 
Pittsburgh.
Since the events beginning 
in 2000, the university has de
veloped wonderful partnerships 
with organizations outside Carn
egie Mellon, Witchner said.
The local service projects in
clude groups such as the Union 
Project, based at the intersection 
of Negley and Stanton avenues, 
which offers communal space for 
neighborhood children and their 
families to gather, attend lec
tures, and learn about the arts. 
Student volunteers will help to 
organize the days events and 
teach childrens art classes.
The Union Project is just one 
of many community organiza
tions looking for volunteers later 
today.
Setting this year apart from 
others is the days keynote 
speaker, Michael Eric Dyson, 
delivering a lecture titled Mar
tin Luther King for the 21st Cen
tury: Hip Hop, Environmental 
Justice, and the State of Black 
America. Dyson, a professor at 
Georgetown University, is also 
the author of 14 books including 
Is Bill Cosby Right? and Come Hell 
Or High Water.
Ive known about this speaker 
since the beginning of the year 
and am really excited, said Bell. 
Its great were having an author 
like him come and speak.
Casalegno echoed Bells excite
ment for the keynote event.
I have seen Michael Dyson 
speak before and find him to be 
an incredibly powerful speaker, 
Casalegno said.
Dyson will speak from 5 to 
6:30 p.m. in Rangos Hall.
While Bell has known about 
the speaker for months, she ques
tioned the amount of publicity for 
Dyson and the event in general.
I walk around campus and 
see all these signs for Winter 
Gala, and when its Black His
tory Month, there are so many 
for that, said Bell, but the ad
vertising for this day seems to be 
lacking.
It is easy for students to ignore 
a letter in a mailbox or just one 
e-mail, Bell added. In the future, 
she hopes to see the day repre
sented much more visually such 
as through chalking and posters.
Yet, Witchner insists that the 
day has consistently had a re
spectable turnout.
I am always excited to see the 
wide range of audience mem
bers that turn out each year, she 
said.
I like to think of the day as a 
great opener to second semester 
and a way of just honoring and 
reflecting on Dr. King, Bell said. 
Im excited to participate this 
year.
Editors Note: Gina Casalegno is 
the faculty advisor for The Tartan
son who found the glove and 
the person who lost it.
Her idea has been the mo
tivation behind several sister 
programs which have been 
started in Denver and New York 
City. The over 125,000 visits to 
her website are further testi
mony to this concepts popular
ity.
For Gooch, the main attribute 
of the project is its universal na
ture. As she put it, there are no 
social or cultural boundaries 
with gloves.
Additionally, Gooch attri
butes some of the projects suc
cess to Turadg Aleahmad, a 
human-computer interaction
Ph.D. student who helped de
sign the website. According 
to Gooch, the help of some
one from a different academic 
background helped to give the 
project another dimension and 
a new freshness.
Although Goochs role in the

difference or impact with their 
education level, and this propels 
the amount of women compelled 
to obtain degrees in higher edu
cation. However, although the 
number of women v receiving 
degrees is increasing faster than 
that of men, it seems that the 
Carnegie Mellon demographic 
almost counters this trend.
According to university data, 
the gender ratio is three men for 
every two women.
James Pan, a first-year chem
istry major, addressed this 
deviation at Carnegie Mellon.
I would say Carnegie Mellon 
is a tech school and a lot of tech 
stuff appeals more to guys than 
girls, and this may contribute to 
more men attaining degrees than
women, said Pan. If you look to 
other schools like Caltech, they 
have about 75 percent guys and 
only 25 percent girls.
Rensselaer Polytechnic In
stitute, a primarily engineer
ing institution, has a men-towomen ratio of 3:1. However, 
MIT boasted a new even ratio in 
2007.
The 3:2 gender ratio, then, is 
likely specific to Carnegie Mellon 
and the programs it offers. When 
asked about his own personal ex
perience in his major classes, Pan 
reported different gender ratios 
in varying areas of study.
In applied sciences, like en
gineering, there are more guys 
than girls, said Pan. But in pure 
sciences, it seems to be an even 
mix because its less technical. 
The general trend is that more
tech schools appeal more to guys 
and thats why they want more 
women engineers.
Raparla agreed with Pan on 
the effects of the studies offered 
at Carnegie Mellon on the gender 
ratio.
As far as Carnegie Mellon 
goes, there is a lack of women in 
the tech field. Its because there 
isnt as much of an expectation 
for women to do well with math, 
said Raparla. If women didnt 
think that they needed to do so 
well in social sciences as op
posed to math and sciences, we 
wouldnt be having this problem 
that we have.
Even though a nationwide 
trend seems to pose new ques
tions for researchers, for now at 
least, Carnegie Mellon remains a 
male-dominated university.

Students acquired new abilities and brushed up on old hobbies with the many classes offered at Summit. The 
majority of the participants were first-years, but many were graduate students and returning upperclassmen.
Summit offers diverse classes
SUMMIT, fromAl
ing to Qureshi, Ma came up with 
the idea when a friend of his 
couldnt take a woodworking 
class because it conflicted with 
his engineering classes.
Ma modeled Summit after 
MITs Independent Activities 
Period, a four-week program 
between the fall and spring 
semesters. Though Carnegie 
Mellons version is on a consider
ably smaller scale, some students 
argue that less is more.
I really like the one [at Carn
egie Mellon] because it gives you 
an open experience into some
thing new, Chawla said, adding 
that he would rather commit to a 
new subject for three days than 
four weeks.
In its first year, Qureshi said, 
Summit had about 130 par
ticipants, a number which more 
than doubled in 2006 to almost 
300 students. Since then, at
tendance has remained about 
the same, and Summits student 
leaders have focused on making
it better, rather than bigger.
We had a lot of people return, 
Qureshi said.
Though many Summit attend
ees were first-years, he noted 
that they came from different 
colleges within Carnegie Mellon 
and that 10 percent were gradu
ate students.

Winter Gala kicks off a new semester of Late Night events
Winter Gala, the biggest Late Night of the year, returned as a remix for its sixth year in the University Center 
last Friday. Different activities, music, and events took over each room. The basement game room became 
a biker bar with root beer, a chance to take pictures on a real motorcycle, and the opportunity to get an airbrushed tattoo. Rangos became a casino while individual rooms took on different cultures, including French, 
complete with colored mardi gras beads, and Japanese, containing a make-your-own sushi bar. Skibo was 
converted into a karaoke party, and students also had the chance to record their own music videos and make 
CD covers on the second floor atrium. The night ended with a raffle that students entered with the tickets 
they had won from the casino or by simply entering each new room.

their hands before approaching 
the patient.
The screen is beneficial to 
the patient because it provides 
reminders to patients to ask for 
help while getting in and out of 
bed, thus reducing the risk of 
accidents. At the same time, the 
screen helps doctors by display
ing the latest patient information 
based on lab results and medica

A team of researchers at Car
negie Mellon CyLab Japan, an 
extension of the Carnegie Mellon 
CyLab Information Technology 
program here at the home cam
pus, are probing into the prac
ticality of cybersecurity  an 
everyday concern in what could 
safely be called the The You
Tube era.
Carnegie Mellon faculty mem
ber and CyLab Systems scientist 
Nicolas Christin, along with Cy
Lab Japan graduate student Hirokazu Sasamoto and alumnus 
Eiji Hayashi, are exploring the 
idea of Internet and ATM secu
rity from the average humans 
perspective.
After a few years dealing 
mostly with technical issues, I 
became very aware that at the 
end of the chain, there is a hu
man using the system that you, 
as an engineer, have designed, 
Christin said.
The human factor defines 
the security decisions people 
make on a day-to-day basis and 
how these decisions influence 
the precautionary measures that 
computer scientists have already 
created.
For example, Christin ex
plained, a scientist can design 
an innovative and highly secure 
door lock, convinced that no one 
will be able to pick it. However, 
buyers of the lock often end up 
replicating the keys for conve
nience and eventually losing 
them  increasing their risk of 
being robbed.
You could blame users for be
ing careless, but Id say that you, 
as system designer, failed from 
a security standpoint, because 
you did not take into account the 
human factor  in that specific 
case, the desire for convenience, 
said Christin.
According to a Carnegie Mel
lon press release, the teams pa
per, Undercover: Authentication 
Usable in Front of Prying Eyes, 
has won tremendous acclaim 
and will be presented at the CHI
2008, an international confer
ence that promotes and unveils 
discoveries in Computer-Human 
Interaction. Held annually, the 
conference will be held this year 
in Florence, Italy.
Since it is hard to predict how 
a potential technology could be 
used by human beings, applying 
advanced scientific techniques 
that work along the lines of the 
human thought-process will 
ensure tighter cybersecurity, 
Christin said.
This is particularly true of 
the security field, where purely 
human factors like fear play 
important roles. People dont
necessarily act rationally when it 
comes to security, he added.
The paper focuses on how to 
incorporate human factors into 
the design of systems such as 
ATM machines and other soft
ware that prompts for the entry 
of a code or PIN, to make the sys
tems more sound and secure.
The research paper describes a 
situation in which such a system 
could be integrated into an ATM 
machine.
While withdrawing money, the 
person behind you can easily fig
ure out what your PIN is just by 
observing you type it. Cunning
thieves also add fake security 
cameras or even mini lenses ad
jacent to keypads. To avert this, 
the system will generate a series 
of highly personalized prompts 
in order to maintain maximum 
security while the user performs 
the conventional ATM functions.
At a high level, we ask a series 
of questions to the user, like Does 
your PIN contain a 2? while se
cretly [giving] an instruction to 
the user to tell a lie or tell the 
truth. The secret instruction is 
conveyed by the movement of 
a tactile device. The user has to 
cover the device with their hand 
to figure its movement, Christin
said.
The system also uses images 
called graphical passwords 
and a combination of more com
plex secret questions, instead 
of PINs. Therefore, the system 
employs the unique ability of 
human beings to combine dif
ferent sensory signals instantly 
to protect their privacy against 
an entire range of attacks.
As information systems be
come increasingly present in the 
21st century, there is a rapidly 
growing user-base that may not 
be adequately trained to take 
the utmost security measures. 
CyLab Japans new cybersecurity 
method poses an answer to com
puter scientists mounting infor
mation security concerns.
Education helps, for sure, but 
as systems are getting increas
ingly complex, we need to make 
sure that security is something 
that comes naturally to most 
people, that they dont even have 
to think about it, Christin said.
CyLab Japan is a partner
ship with CMUs Information 
Networking Institute, the 
Heinz School, and the Hyogo 
Prefectural Government, a 
governmental body of Japan 
situated in the Kinki region. 
CyLab Japan currently offers a 
Master of Science in Information 
Technology with an Informa
tion Security Track (MSIT-IS) in 
Kobe, Japan, as a graduate pro
gram of Carnegie Mellon.

A team of U.S. researchers has 
created the darkest material 
to date; it is able to absorb light 
from many angles and wave
lengths while reflecting as little 
light as possible.
To create the material, scien
tists used carbon nanotubes  
carbon cylinders with walls only 
one atom thick.
For scientists, the biggest 
hurdle in developing such a 
material was minimizing reflec

difficulty by creating a rough 
surface on the carbon nano

The end result was three times 
less reflective than the previous 
record, making it the darkest 
ever man-made material.

Health Talk: Bird flu
Jennifer Kennedy/Art Staff
AKANKSHA VAIDYA
Staffwriter
We tend to take the term com
mon cold quite literally. A sneeze 
is usually dismissed with no more 
than a bless you and a tissue.
However, this simple sneeze 
may not be as harmless as we may 
believe.
Avian influenza or bird flu, as 
it is more commonly known, also 
starts off with a simple sneeze  
leading to something far worse 
than the common cold.
The bird flu has recently be
come a major cause of death in 
Southeast Asia. According to a 
New Delhi Television Limited 
press release, the deadly dis
ease is currently propagating at 
an alarmingly increasing rate in 
West Bengal, India. Should the 
disease continue to spread like 
wildfire, it will soon reach the 
level of a pandemic.
The H5N1 virus, whichisknown 
to cause bird flu in humans, is one 
of a family of avian influenza vi
ruses. These viruses reside in the 
intestines of wild birds, such as 
wild ducks and swans. Wild birds 
are an ideal host for the H5N1 
virus due to their environmental 
and migration logistics.
While the viruses do not nor
mally harm the wild birds they 
reside in, they render domestic 
birds like chickens and turkeys 
extremely sick.
Infected birds contain the virus 
in their saliva and excreta, and 
birds that come in contact with 
such saliva or excreta also con
tract the disease. Thus, among 
domestic fowl, the disease is not 
only fatal but highly contagious.
H5N1 drew attention because 
of its growing transmission to hu
man beings.
H5N1 contradicted the earlier 
belief that avian influenza only 
affected birds. The disease was 
first reported to attack humans in 
1997 in Hong Kong. A total of 18 
cases were reported, six of which 
were fatal. According to a Reu
ters press release, there are 118 
reported cases to date in Indone
sia, the nation hit hardest by the 
disease. Voice of America News 
reported 97 of those to be fatal. 
The U.S. government has been 
stockpiling a pre-pandemic vac
cine, said Anita Barkin, Director 
of Health Services.
The pre-pandemic vaccine has 
been made from the genetic ma
terial of viruses (such as H5N1) 
that are currently circulating.
The difficulty with producing 
such vaccines is that the virus can 
mutate and form a new strain, 
thus rendering previously pro
duced vaccines useless.
A similar problem is encoun
tered while administering antivirals to affected patients.
The concern is that if we use 
anti-virals like Tamiflu to treat a
large number of patients, resis
tant strains of the virus could oc
cur and the anti-virals would no 
longer be effective. What might 
end up being effective in the end 
is a cocktail of anti-virals, said 
Barkin.
Having said that, statistics that 
indicate that the bird flu is local
ized to East Asia can be rather 
misleading. In fact, in 2006 the 
H5N1 virus was detected in wild 
swans in Michigan. The global
ization of the disease is a result of 
migratory birds carrying the dis
ease with them to different parts 
of the world.
Although bird flu is contagious 
among the bird species, it does 
not spread from one human being 
to another.
The cases that have occurred 
today have occurred in places 
where [people] have had close 
contact with infected birds or 
have been involved in the butch
ering of birds and the handling 
of raw meat, she said. Thor
oughlycooked meat is safe to eat 
and handle, so it is important to 
make sure that meat isnt raw or 
partially cooked before consump
tion, Barkin said.
In addition to watching out for 
infected animals or undercooked 
meat, regular health check-ups 
could prove to be lifesavers. It 
doesnt matter where you live  
finding out the reason behind that 
sneeze could save your life.
How Things Work: Traffic Lights
Disha Shah 
Marium Chandna
Once merely timers attached to a 
pole, traffic signals today are way more 
sophisticated than that. They have the 
greatest impact on and virtually control 
a citys traffic.
There are three main kinds of traffic 
signals.
To begin with, there are the pre
timed signals. Those are simply timers 
that change the lights from red to 
green at fixed intervals. Although pre
timed signals change at a constant rate 
irrespective of the traffic, the time span 
between two intervals may vary in dif
ferent areas depending on the estimated 
traffic flow of the area. The schedule of 
intervals may also change throughout 
the day according to traffic flow.
Next, there are semi-actuated traf
fic signals that sense the traffic at the 
sides of the streets and change lights ac
cordingly. They are able to do this with 
the help of sensors called electronic 
detector loops that are fitted beneath 
pavements. The electronic detector 
loops (similar in function to metal de
tectors) detect vehicles that stop at the 
traffic lights. This enables vehicles to 
pass without waiting long when roads 
are empty.
These type of signals are normally 
installed where a main road intersects 
a low-paved one. The efficiency of semi
actuated traffic lights falls apart when
smaller vehicles, like motorcycles and 
bicycles, approach the traffic signal. A 
more detectable vehicle needs to roll 
by in order for the semi-actuated signal 
to sense the presence of a vehicle on the 
road.
Finally, there are fully-actuated 
traffic signals that sense the amount of 
traffic (the number of cars) and change
the light to green automatically. These 
are also known as synchronized sig
nals. Unlike semi-actuated signals, 
fully-actuated signals have sensors on 
major and minor roads. The entire sys
tem works together to conciliate the 
traffic.
A variation of fully-actuated signals 
are coordinated signals. Those are
Joey Gannon/Photo Staff
controlled by a chief controller and are 
programmed so that the green lights 
glow for a lengthy stretch of time. Thus, 
a great amount of vehicles can pass, 
leading to a substantial reduction in 
speeding.
Generic semiand fully-actuated traf
fic signals can sense the number of cars 
and their frequency by a coil fitted below
the road. These wires are connected to 
controller equipment. There is a small 
amount of electric field present on the 
wire. When a car passes over the coil, 
the magnetic material present in the 
car changes the inductance on the wire. 
The controller equipment recognizes 
the change in inductance as vehicles 
pass by and changes the frequency of 
green light. The white bar painted on 
the road is usually where the last coil in 
that particular lane is located.
In places where it is difficult to fit the 
coils, different methods of traffic detec
tion are used. For example, the City of 
Oak Ridges uses microwaves to sense 
traffic. The microwaves are detected 
using a closed circuit monitor fixed on a 
pole. This device works similarly to the 
radar guns used by the police and it can 
barely detect extremely slow-moving 
vehicles.
Areas that are likely to experience 
emergency traffic on a regular basis, 
such as roads with hospitals, are in
stalled with signals that are somewhat 
interruptible. In other words, emer
gency vehicles like police cars and am
bulances can break the signal without 
causing any harm to other cars. A pre
emption sequence makes this possible, 
as it blocks all other intersections by 
changing those signals to red.
Traffic signals were initially estab
lished in 1868, near the British Houses 
of Parliament in London, England. 
However, the modem version of the 
traffic signal was developed in America 
in 1912.

Its not easy being green
Lizzee Solomon/Art Editor
Dr. Kings legacy is not up for grabs
In this years presidential primaries, 
the politics of identity is ubiquitous. 
In addition to fights over who is black, 
poor, or woman enough, comparisons 
to historical figures cover the headlines. 
Obama juggles comparisons to John and 
Bobby Kennedy, spats break out over 
who is most akin to Truman, and all of 
the Republicans are scrambling to claim 
Reagans legacy. The result is that our 
perceptions of the candidates are ob
scured by comparisons to artificial racial 
or gender norms, or idealized notions of 
history.
Recently, the comparisons took an 
ever more sour turn when Clinton and 
Obama started to argue over the legacy
of Martin Luther King Jr. Last week, 
Clinton remarked that Kings dream was 
only realized when President Johnson 
began to sign legislations, which Obama 
claimed belittled Kings work.
The notion that one candidate could 
attack another on the legacy of Dr. King 
holds the tacit implication that one de
serves to be more closely associated 
with his legacy than another, when in 
fact, neither deserves to claim Dr. Kings 
work for his or her own, directly or in
directly. In quarreling over Dr. King, the 
two leading Dems only entrench them
selves further in the politics of identity.
This is not to say that Hillary and Ba
rack should not fight about who will do
best by minorities in the U.S. or who will 
best protest civil rights. These are excel
lent conversations to engage in, and both 
have demonstrated a commitment to 
civil and human rights: Barack through 
community organizing on the South Side 
of Chicago, and Hillary through working 
on behalf of children, families, migrant 
laborers, and healthcare reform.
Each of these candidates has his or 
her own history in the support of civil 
rights to stand on and it is not necessary 
to claim Kings. It was unfortunate that 
they decided to quarrel over the mem
ory of Dr. King only a week before the 
day when his contributions should be 
receiving redoubled honor.
Odyssey should look past QPAs
From Jan. 10 through 12, 75 carefully 
selected sophomores participated in 
Odyssey, an introspective program de
signed to help them best evaluate their 
academic skills and apply them toward 
internships and post-graduate work. 
They crafted public policy statements, 
discussed research topics, and practiced 
writing professionally for job and in
ternship applications. The general con
sensus from those involved was that the 
program was helpful for students.
But what about those who were not 
involved? The 200 students selected 
to apply were chosen above the other 
1000-plus members of the class of 2010 
based primarily on their QPAs. Why 
should a program designed to instill 
ideas about preparing oneself for the 
future be limited to a select few?
After the top students in each depart
ment (those with a QPA of 3.4 or higher) 
were sifted out from the rest of their 
classmates, a list was sent to faculty ad
visers, department heads, and certain 
Student Affairs personnel, who col
lectively know [their] students better 
than anyone, according to the letter 
sent out by the Office of Undergraduate 
Research. These sources then picked the 
top five of those students in each depart
ment based on their limited interaction 
with them, mostly as first-year students.
We agree that for a program to al
low for individualized attention there 
must be a way to judge who participates. 
Maybe part of this selection is aca
demic  after all, Odyssey is intended 
to instruct students how to best apply 
their strong academic records to the 
real world. But we question whether 
academic advisers and first-year pro
fessors  and a select few high-level 
Student Affairs employees  are the 
most qualified to assess the success of 
sophomore students. Housefellows, ex
tracurricular activity advisors, and club 
presidents often know students better 
than academic personnel with whom 
students interact a few hours per week, 
at best.
We commend the facilitators of Odys
sey on a successful program with good 
intentions, one that will undoubtedly 
help students in writing clear proposals 
and getting the best internships. But on 
a campus that so emphasizes extracur
ricular involvement and interdisciplin
ary study, both of which can lead to lessthan-stellar QPAs, we question whether 
the realm of academics is the most im
portant place to start looking for ex
cited learners and self-starters.
The Constitution  and its guards  should protect, not punish
Last week we learned that the secu
rity staff at the National Archives in 
Washington, D.C. has a bit of an inter
esting interpretation of one of the docu
ments they protect. At a viewing of the 
Constitution, multiple visitors who had 
been part of John Nirembergs impeach
ment march were told to leave because 
of the clothing they were wearing. As 
they had just come from the impeach
ment march, many had slogans such as 
Impeach Bush + Cheney or Arrest 
Bush printed on T-shirts.
In the journalism world, we tend to 
be pretty big supporters of the First 
Amendment, which is ott permanent 
display at the National Archives, for 
its protection of both the freedom of
speech and the freedom of the press. The 
visitors, protected by the First Amend
ment and the Constitution, should not 
expect to run into any trouble visiting 
the document which has set the foun
dation for protecting the impeachment 
march.
It seems there was a disconnect 
between the National Archives rules 
prohibiting protesting and the guards 
inability to differentiate protesting from 
protesters. The guards were (strangely) 
forthcoming, quoted in a news ar
ticle from www.OpEdNews.com as 
saying, You need to leave because of 
your T-shirt. One of the marchers, 
Suzanne Haviland, said a guard had 
said to her: The reason Im stopping
you is that you are wearing something 
that criticizes the President. Im a fed
eral employee, and Im not allowed to 
criticize the President, according to an 
article on www.AfterDowningStreet. 
org.
Faced with an irony so compelling, we 
are left wondering if the security staff 
are so brainwashed by their jobs that 
they entirely misunderstand the early 
legislature of our country, which they 
are tasked to protect.
As the 21st century trudges forward, 
we have to wonder if the rights granted 
to us over 200 years ago are being swept 
away for a false sense of national secu
rity and a forced pride in our current 
government.
Can I take out a restraining 
order against my own school?

An open letter to the Office of Annual 
Giving:
Nothing would make me happier than 
parlaying my Carnegie Mellon educa
tion into a career in which I find myself 
professionally satisfied and financially 
prosperous. At that time, an army of 
armored polar bears (sorry, I just saw 
Golden Compass) could not stop me from 
monetarily expressing my gratitude to 
Carnegie Mellon.
Until that time, though, I would re
ally, super-duper, extra-specially-witha-cherry-on-top appreciate it if you folks 
at the Office of Annual Giving would get 
off my back.
You have sent me countless e-mails 
and letters, all trying to wheedle money 
out of me. Those are little more than 
an annoyance, but recently you seem 
especially intent on crossing the line 
between dismissible and despicable. In 
the middle of finals week last semester, 
for example, you forced your student 
volunteers to pull out their personal 
cell phones and telemarket to their own 
friends and acquaintances.
Im baffled: What exactly were you
I understood that it was also a busi
ness, but hey, thats capitalism for you. 
Since the day that chubby envelope ar
rived in the mail, I have been a cease
less ambassador for Carnegie Mellon. 
My enrollment opened a floodgate of 
applications from my high school. I 
wear my maroon hoodie like a second 
skin.
But I guess my attitude and allegiance 
are just too far removed from what mat
ters most: my cold, hard cash.
On your website you urge students 
and alumni to update their contact 
information to ensure that theyre 
receiving the latest news and event 
information from Carnegie Mellon. 
Something about that seems fishy to 
me  I highly doubt you sit there all 
atwitter at the prospect of informing me 
about whatever new sculpture the uni
versity is installing because the Federal 
Aviation Association wont let the artist 
keep it in his backyard. No, I think you 
want that updated information so that 
you always know where to outstretch 
your hand.
In closing, while I have your atten
tion, I was wondering if youd like to 
make a donation. See, Ive just become 
founder and chairman of the brand-new 
Office of Leaving Me the Hell Alone So 
I Can Graduate and Get a Job, and any 
start-up funds I can accrue will really go 
a long away toward my stated goal. May

during the most demanding week of my 
senior year and implying that I, some
how, had not yet given Carnegie Mellon

Maybe next you could give your

would they have to provide their own

For much of the past four years (af

believed that Carnegie Mellon was a 
place of intellectualism and sincerity;
I put you down for $20.08? Remember, 
nothing shows you care like awkward 
checkbook math!
Please let me know, as Ill be sending 
a follow-up e-mail shortly.

Student Senate minutes should be regularly updated
I am writing to request that you 
print a correction to Akshay Daves 
article, All Senate positions filled, 
which appeared in the News section 
of the Dec. 3 issue of The Tartan. The 
article claimed, For the first time in 
seven years, Carnegie Mellons Student 
Senate is full. This is simply false, as 
can been seen by reviewing the min
utes of the Student Senate meet
ings, which are publicly available 
at http://senate. web. cmu.edu/minutes. 
At a Student Senate meeting on Feb. 
24, 2005  fewer than three years 
ago  a motion was made to fill the 
last remaining vacancy. In fact, that 
seat  and all others  remained filled 
through the end of the spring 2005 
Senate session.
The source of this error appears to 
be junior Tepper School of Business 
Senator Jared Itkowitz. I commend 
Senator Itkowitz and his colleagues 
for their efforts in filling vacancies. A
full Student Senate is a sign that stu
dents recognize the legislative body as 
a vehicle for positive change on cam
pus. However, I was disappointed to see 
that the web page that links to Student 
Senate minutes has not been updated 
since January 2007.
Itkowitz was also quoted as say
ing that he is working to increase 
transparency in the Senate through 
the newly formed Student Government 
Visibility Committee. Might I suggest 
that this committee take on the initia
tive of publishing the minutes of all 
Student Senate meetings on the web, 
as was done during my tenure as chair 
of the Student Senate Communications 
Committee.

THE TARTAN  JANUARY 21, 2008
Teen queens and Internet TV: The real staying power of Gossip Girl
SHALEYA SOLOMON
Every fall brings an onslaught 
of new shows. Some make it, 
some dont; some you love to 
hate, and some you hate to love. 
This season brought us a new 
show that is quickly becoming 
a favorite. Based on the novels 
by Cecily von Ziegesar, the CWs 
Gossip Girl is what some people 
are calling the new The O.C.. Of 
course, it doesnt hurt that The 
O.C.s executive-producer-withan-eye-for-teenage-drama, Josh 
Schwartz, is also the executive 
producer on the new hit show. 
Why is Gossip Girl so good? Im 
not entirely sure if good is real
ly the word, but one thing is for 
sure: It is addictive.
The lives of Manhattans elite 
are detailed by a mysterious 
blogger under the pseudonym of 
Gossip Girl. We never actually 
find out who Gossip Girl is, but 
she is voiced by the infamously 
snarky Kristen Bell (of Veronica 
Mars and Heroes fame). If any
thing happens in the world of the 
upper-crust, Gossip Girl knows 
about it, and spreads the word on 
her website.
The pilot brings us into the 
world of Upper Eastsiders as char
acter Serena van der Woodsen 
arrives in Grand Central Station. 
We are immediately introduced 
to the prominence of the social 
grapevine, as someone spots her 
and texts everyone to let them 
know the news: Serena is back 
after a mysterious six-month dis
appearance to boarding school 
in Connecticut, and therefore, 
drama is imminent. Upon return
ing, the former queen and resident 
party girl of Constance-Billard 
School for Girls finds that she has 
been whisked off her pedestal, 
replaced by her best friend and 
poster-child for good behavior, 
Blair Waldorf. Due to various 
circumstances (not the least of 
which is the fact that Serena slept 
with Blairs boyfriend, Nate), Blair 
hates Serena. An on-again-offagain friendship resumes for the 
remainder of the aired episodes. 
Meanwhile, with social status out 
the window, Dan Humphrey, a shy, 
moral boy at Constance-Billards 
brother school, St. Judes, enters 
the picture as Serenas new beau. 
Aside from that, Dans little sister, 
Jenny, is trying desperately to 
get in with Blair and her friends, 
while fighting off advances from 
Nates sinister best friend, Chuck, 
whose personality can be likened 
to that of the devious yet subdy 
sensitive Sebastian Valmont in 
Cruel Intentions.
Confused yet? We all are. The 
show is insane, and it is fantastic.
The real power behind Gossip 
Girl is its seeming intangibility: 
Probably 95 percent of people will 
never experience the lavish lives 
that these teens live. Its a fantasy 
world with characters through 
whom viewers are allowed to live 
vicariously  watching rich peo
ple stress about their problems of 
social status and reputation is a 
great escape from real problems 
like getting financial aid and find
ing the perfect internship. Also,
Blairs reputation. Using this 
technology, gossip is now virtu
ally instantaneous.
And if the characters of Gossip 
Girl rely on technology, so do the 
fans.
The shows viewers can catch 
up on any gossip theyve missed 
by watching the episodes online, 
as most TV networks are now 
offering full episodes on their 
websites. Fans of shows like 30 
Rock, Heroes, and Greys Anatomy 
can go online to watch episodes 
at a time other than their regularIts a fantasy world with characters 
through whom viewers are allowed 
to live vicariously.
hot teens in expensive clothing 
are definite bonuses.
On top of the drama, Gossip Girl 
makes a mild social commentary 
on technology. I know it is impos
sible for me to imagine my life 
without a cell phone nowadays; 
and in the show, cell phones can 
pretty much do everything. With 
one picture, half the junior class 
is almost suspended from school; 
with one text, Chuck destroys
ly scheduled television time slots. 
In addition, the networks know 
that putting episodes online is a 
great way to get more viewers for 
a show even at mid season.
I think that watching shows 
online is a great idea  its free, 
convenient, and legal! That being 
said, part of the reason Hollywood 
writers are on strike is that they 
do not receive money off of ads 
from online episodes. Now, I
want to help them and watch 
Gossip Girl during its regular
ly scheduled time, but certain 
extraneous circumstances (read: 
school) make that impossible. 
Most fans (myself included) 
enjoy the freedom and conve
nience of technology way too 
much to give it up, just like the 
Gossip Girl characters depend on 
cell phones.
Gossip Girl has real stay
ing power, in part because it 
is so technologically relevant. 
However, I am worried as to what 
will happen when it reaches the 
teen drama death trap: college. 
But thats in the future. For right 
now, Gossip Girl has everything 
it needs to remain a hit. Maybe 
those things are superficial (hot 
stars, great clothes, scandals, 
and insanity), but escapism isnt 
perfect. It is true that the dia
logue in Gossip Girl is somewhat 
lacking, but who cares? Its still 
entertaining.
Ifyou want something ofvalue, 
watch 60 Minutes. Otherwise, sit 
back and enjoy the drama.
Shaleya Solomon (ssolomon@} 
thinks that people should stop 
comparing Gossip Girl to The
O.C. (The O.C. is done! Get over 
it! They are not the same show!), 
but welcomes all comments. 
XOXO, Gossip Girl.
Hillary Clinton does not represent real women
'jfutfel)
JESSICA THURSTON
Elections fever is gearing up. 
We know this.
Both major parties have insane 
amounts of presidential hope
fuls contending for the coveted 
Democratic and Republican tick
ets. We know this too.
We also know that two supposedly 
unlikely candidates  a black man 
and a white woman  are the frontrunners in the Democratic party pri
maries.
What we dont know is what 
role these physical traits, namely 
color and gender, and the latters 
more subjective counterpart, sex
uality, should play in the upcom
ing election. Is Obama more qual
ified to fight for the civil liberties 
of traditionally underrepresented 
minorities because he may be 
of similar heritage as some of 
them? Is Huckabee more quali
fied to represent the southern 
states because of his down-home, 
Arkansas upbringing?
I dont know the answers to 
these questions, and Im not 
sure of the best way to figure 
them out. What I do know is that 
character traits that are seem
ingly independent of political 
platforms  namely race and 
gender  shouldnt be exploited 
for political gains.
Hillary is a woman (were 
told). Thats great. Im a womanin-training, and as such, I think 
its pretty sweet that a traditional
ly subjugated, underrepresented 
group is now a major player in 
the public sector. Air five, ladies.
But beyond that, Hillary is a 
candidate just like any other. 
Hillary is Barack is John is Mike is 
Mitt. Where these candidates dif
fer importantly is in their beliefs

 not in their gender, not in their 
sexuality, and not in their color. 
We shouldnt favor a candidate based 
primarily on a superficial trait.
And in that vein, I think its 
unjust for Hillary to simultane
ously exploit her gender  and 
those who share it.
Mrs. Clinton is infamous for 
her darling pantsuits (which 
look strangely similar to the ones 
sported by republican hopeful 
John McCain). At times, it seems 
that she also lowers her voice 
to something of a throaty growl, 
particularly when surrounded by
her male counterparts. She even 
ditched a photo shoot for the 
cover of Vogue, likely fearing its 
overly feminine label. I, person
ally, would never want to anger 
Vogue editor Anna Wintour in 
such a way, who responded to 
being stood up by calling out our 
dearest Hillsie, as reported by 
www.jezebel.com-, The notion 
that a contemporary woman must 
look mannish in order to be taken 
seriously as a seeker of power is 
frankly dismaying, she said. How 
has our country come to this? 
Now, Anna, thats not fair.
Lizzee Solomon/Art Editor
Neither women nor men should 
don such heinous pantsuits.
But, seemingly at her conve
nience, Hillary turns the tables 
on the female American public. 
During a campaign stop in New 
Hampshire, when 64-year-old 
Maryann Pernold asked Hillary 
how she stays put together and 
hits the campaign trail every day, 
Hillary, surrounded by women, 
cried. Yes, Captain Pantsuit cried, 
after faintly explaining that she is 
up against some pretty difficult 
odds. Sure, she was tired, over
worked, and daunted by the fact
that more people follow Perez 
Hilton than the nightly news 
(I am only slightly incriminat
ing myself in this statement). 
I understand that. But Hillary 
crying around a table of skep
tical female voters challenges 
that which she is theoretically 
so gung-ho about: establish
ing the woman as a legitimate 
political player.
It should not take tears to earn 
the American womans vote. 
It should not be a breakdown 
of emotion that unites women 
everywhere. Why does any 
presidential candidate have to 
remain stoic or uncollected to 
get our attention?
They dont. Hillary must stop 
alternating between brutish 
and severe (masculine), and 
mawkish and soft (feminine) 
as a means of earning her ticket 
to Washington. Femininity and 
sexuality are not equivalent 
to speech mannerisms, for 
example. You cant decide to 
be more or less feminine one 
day depending on the people 
surrounding you at a campaign 
table  in the same way that 
you can speak with more or less 
of a southern accent depending on 
the state youre visiting, Hillsie.
I really think were past this. A 
female president, a black presi
dent, a gay president  were 
there. This election has to do 
more for our country than give 
us a reason to pat ourselves on 
the back and say Hey, look, Im 
less judgmental than before! 
Reducing Hillary Clintons iden
tity to her gender  whether 
she or we are guilty  reduces 
every female voter, too.
Jessica Thurston (jthursto@) is 
Forum Editor of The Tartan. She 
would really like to introduce Hillsie 
to the power of an Oscar de la Renta 
skirt no crying allowed.
Elections reform 
and institutional 
memory
WHKT BHOTWGIU' C KMO VKOT
Hey, Tartans. Since youre 
reading this a week into classes, 
let me be pretty much the last 
one to welcome you back from 
break!
Adi and I have decidedly 
turned up the heat this semester, 
and weve begun by tackling quite 
a bit already. The major agenda 
item that we hit this week was 
elections reform. We brought a 
piece of legislation that has been 
in the planning and researching 
stages for several months to the 
Graduate Student Assembly and 
the Undergraduate Student Sen
ate with the goal of providing 
a clearer, step-by-step solution 
where only vague rhetoric ex
isted before. This change should 
ensure that voters and candidates 
alike never have to endure the 
same kind of elections cycle we 
all suffered through last year. As 
expected, there are already some 
revisions to be made to align our 
goals with those of your legis
lative student representatives. 
However, were still on schedule 
to institute the requisite changes 
by the spring elections cycle. 
So, while you may not notice it 
directly, there will be many al
terations in the way elections are 
handled the next time youre at 
the polls.
We have also made distinct 
progress on our institutional 
memory initiative. This process 
has been equally as complicated, 
and we have sought help from 
our student organizational lead
ership as well as student gov
ernment advisors to bring the 
campus a tool that allows orga
nizations to maintain knowledge 
more effectively. The goal is to 
allow campus organizations to 
continually develop rather than 
seeing a reboot occur every year 
when a new leader comes in, 
lacking several years of perspec
tive guiding his or her decisions. 
And, for those organizations 
that have respectable institu
tional memory systems in place, 
the idea is to allow for a digital 
storage space alternative, just in 
case. In the coming weeks, we 
should be closing out the proj
ects interface design portion, af
ter which the name of the game 
is implementation.
Again, I hope everyone had a 
great break and is starting out 
the new year right!
As always, if you have any 
questions, comments, or con
cerns, feel free to e-mail me at 
cmu5@cmu.edu.

THE TARTAN  JANUARY 21, 2008
Basketball had successful winter 
break with 10-4 overall record
BASKETBALL ,fromA12
13-point first-half lead after 
NYU went to a 2-3 zone. Head 
coach Tony Wingens offense 
sputtered, to put it mildly, and 
the Violets capitalized and went 
on a run of their own, cutting 
the lead to four before the half.
We werent able to spread 
their defense, said ORourke. 
They threw that zone at us, 
and we had a tough time getting 
back into a rhythm. Turnovers
really killed us in the first half 
when they made that little run.
The second half was no better 
for the home team, as the Skibo 
natives could do nothing to stop 
the visitors from New York City. 
After a couple seesaws with the 
lead in the last few minutes, the 
Violets pulled ahead and sealed 
their victory with a clutch-free 
throw shooting down the stretch.
The Tartans (10-4,0-3) exited 
winter break with a head full of 
steam, but after two huge back
slides, theyve seen virtually all 
of their momentum evaporate. 
Winless in the UAA, Carnegie 
Mellon has its collective back 
against the wall as the team 
heads to Cleveland this Friday 
to face another conference op
ponent, Case Western Reserve. 
The teams players are more than 
aware of the task in front of them.
We started digging our own 
grave, said junior forward 
Jon Wolleben. But were not 
quite ready to jump in it yet.

DOUG FRICKER
American sprinter and Olym
pic champion Marion Jones lied 
to federal investigators about 
her steroid use, and now shes 
heading to jail. For six months! 
Not only does Joness behavior 
disgrace the track and field com
munity so near to the Beijing 
Olympics, but the severity of her 
sentence must also have shocked 
and scared other professional 
athletes.
At the 2000 Sydney Olympics, 
Jones won five medals, includ
ing gold medals in the 100- and 
200-meter dashes. Last Octo
ber, Jones admitted in a tearful 
speech that she had used perfor
mance-enhancing drugs, dating 
back to 1999. She said that her 
former coach Trevor Graham 
gave her the steroid known as 
the clear from that point until 
2001. Jones claims that when 
Graham initially gave her ste
roids he told her it was flaxseed 
oil and that she didnt realize the 
truth until she left Graham and 
had stopped taking it. She has 
since been stripped of all five 
medals and her name has been 
removed from all record books.
Jones was charged and sen
tenced on Friday, Jan. 11 by U.S. 
District Court Judge Kenneth 
Karas. Jones apologized and 
begged not to be separated from 
her two sons, but the damage 
had been done, and as hip hop 
artist Timbaland would say, Its 
too late to apologize!
SPORTS COMMENTARY
Joness jail sentence sends a 
strong message to athletes who 
have used drugs and/or lied 
about it. Jones was nailed for ly
ing under oath, which proves that 
even professional athletes wont 
get away with telling lies. Jones 
knew taking steroids was illegal, 
but she did it for two years. She 
knew that the consequences for 
getting caught would be steep  
maybe she didnt know theyd be 
this harsh, but its out of her con
trol at this point.
Professional athletics has be
come riddled with steroids accu
sations like a modern day Salem, 
Ma. Over the past decade, MLB 
has done an embarrassing job of 
cracking down on performanceenhancing drug use. Baseball 
players today have avoided the 
tough questions up to this point, 
but theyll have to start talking 
soon. Congressional hearings re
sume Feb. 13 and the truth will 
come out.
It will be the word of Roger 
Clemens versus the word of his 
former trainer Brian McNamee. 
Clemens has denied using performance-enhancing drugs up 
to this point, but what will hap
pen when he goes under oath? 
Will Clemens end up with the 
same fate as Jones? Will Miguel 
Tejada they come, the harder 
they fall never play for his new 
team, the Houston Astros, be
cause he reportedly lied under 
oath in 2005 when he told fed
eral authorities he never took 
performance-enhancing drugs?
For years, athletes have hid 
their drug use by lying to the me
dia, cycling their use of banned 
substances, and using masking 
agents so they test negative. But! 
as Bob Dylan would say, The 
times they are a-changin. The 
federal government is digging 
its hands deep into this steroids 
mess and this is bad news for 
these athletes. Up to this point 
the punishments levied have 
lacked consistency and have 
contained major flaws. Expect 
things to change with the greater 
involvement of the federal gov
ernment.
Jones lied and shes going to 
jail, but what about the athletes 
who confessed to taking perfor
mance-enhancing drugs? These 
athletes are free. Is that fair? 
What about the fact that Jones 
is a woman, that shes in an indi
vidual sport, or that track is not 
one of the four major sports? Jose 
Canseco took steroids, but hes a 
free man and making money as 
an author, which is ironic be
cause I dont think he can read. 
Wait, Mr. Canseco, I apologize. 
You could easily beat me up.
The truth will come out now 
that the federal government has 
taken up the steroids cause and 
is ready to separate the good 
from the evil and the innocent 
from the guilty. Marion Jones is 
now paying the price and many 
other athletes might not be far 
behind her. This is good news for 
a sports world that is overflow
ing with suspicion.
Womens basketball drops to UAA competitors
RAE WEN SHEE
Staffwriter
The previous few weeks saw the 
Carnegie Mellon womens basket
ball team travelling to compete in 
Mexico, Ohio, and Rochester.
In the Caribbean Hoops Show
down in Mexico, the Tartans lost 
in hard-fought battles to both 
La Verne and Concordia-Austin, 
56-65 and 56-60 respectively. 
The players then traveled to 
Ohio, where they rebounded 
to claim a win over Wittenberg 
University 78-74, before finally 
conceding to John Carroll 45-72. 
Next, the Tartans traveled to 
play the University of Roch
ester, where they lost 54-65 
in their UAA season opener.
Last week, the Tartans re
turned home to host the Bethany 
College Bison, the Brandeis Uni
versity Judges, and the New York 
University Violets. Following 
intense action and clutch free 
; throw shooting, the Tartans held 
on to edge the Bison 71-68 on 
Monday before falling short to 
the Judges 56-74 and then later 
also to the Violets 38-50. With 
this, the Tartans dropped to 
' 7-7 overall and 0-3 in the UAA.
In the match against La Verne 
in Cancn, Mexico, junior Sta
cie Aleski led the team in scor
ing with 15 points, while junior 
Ashley Rothwell added 12, and 
. sophomore Paige Williamson
10. Junior forward Rachelle 
Roll contributed 8 rebounds and 
a game-high 7 assists. Points 
in the paint for the Leopards 
seem to make the difference as 
they put in 24 to the Tartans 8.
Against Concordia-Austin, 
Aleski once again led the team 
with 16 points while Rothwell 
added 14 and Williamson 11. 
The Tartans fell behind by 17 
points in the first half, but outscored the Tornados 40-32 in 
the second period. However, 
this did not seem sufficient 
as the Tartans finally con
ceded to the Tornados 56-60.
Against the Bison, a pair of 
double-doubles (accumulating 
double-digit numbers in two cat
egories points, rebounds, assists, 
steals, and blocked shots) from 
Roll and Feola propelled the 
Tartans and gave them a welldeserved win. Carnegie Mellon 
reeled off nine straight points 
in the second half to take the 
teams biggest lead of the game 
at 46-34 with 16:38 remaining. 
Bethany then fought back to cut 
the deficit to two points on a lay
up by Goode with 16 seconds 
left, but Roll hit both free throws 
on the other end of the floor 
to bring the Tartan lead back 
to four. Bison first-year guard 
Tara Harris then nailed a threepointer, making the score 69-68 
with eight seconds left, but 
Aleski was fouled and hit both
her free throws to seal the win.
This team works very hard 
not only during the season but 
also during the off-seasons, Roll 
said. We know that we still have 
a lot to work on but I think the 
positive attitude of this team 
and the determination to have 
a winning season is really vital 
to the outcome of this season.
Roll finished with a gamehigh 17 points and a careerhigh 17 rebounds to lock up her 
second career double-double. 
Feola also collected 17 points 
to go with career-highs of 14 re
bounds and seven steals for her 
fourth career double-double.
On Friday, the Tartans took 
on the Judges. Strong rebound
ing and stifling defense by the 
visiting Judges proved to be too 
much for the Tartans as they lost 
74-56. Brandeis jumped out to 
an early 12-4 lead after a jump 
shot by senior guard Kiersten 
Holgash, but Carnegie Mellon 
narrowed the Judges advan
tage to 14-12 thanks in part 
to back-to-back three-pointers 
from Aleski and Williamson.
However, Brandeis gradually 
extended their lead in the second 
half, leading by as much as 26 be
fore winning by 18. Feola led the 
Tartans with 15 points and nine 
rebounds while Aleski collected 
a career-high seven steals and 
Roll earned a career-high three 
blocks. Aleski finished with 13
points and Williamson contrib
uted a season-high 12 points.
In the final game of the week 
against NYU, neither NYU nor 
Carnegie Mellon had much suc
cess offensively in the first half 
with NYU going into halftime 
leading 24-17. The Violets shot 
28.6 percent from the floor in 
the first 20 minutes and the Tar
tans shot 25 percent. The Tar
tans were down by as many as 
15 points but managed to nar
row the margin with a basket 
from junior forward Jeannette 
Schilling, capping off the game.
We held a nationally ranked 
team, in fact third in the coun
try, this weekend. Next week, 
we are going to need to play as a 
team and then well be success
ful in our UAA season. We need 
to play strong. Our only way to 
be successful is to play off each 
other, play as a team, build up 
positivity, said sophomore Paige 
Williamson. Making the ECAC 
[Eastern College Athletic Con
ference] tournament and ending 
the season at .500 are our main 
goals for the end of the season. 
Our next step is to beat Case 
Western and Emory this com
ing weekend. We need to play 
solid defense and get rebounds.
The Tartans look to bounce 
back on Friday, Jan. 25 when they 
will travel to Cleveland to play 
Case Western Reserve University.

Final home dual swim meet ends victoriously
LAUREN WINCHESTER
Junior Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon mens 
and womens swimming teams 
beat Case Western Reserve Uni
versity in Cleveland on Jan. 12. 
The women won 120-85 and 
the men 137-68. Not only did 
first-year Molly Evans win two 
events during the meet, Evans 
set her fourth individual school 
record in the 1000-yard free
style with a time of 10:32.23.
Impressive swims also came 
from junior Allison Retotar 
and senior Lauren Connell, 
who won the 200-yard and 
100-yard freestyles, respec
tively. Senior co-captain Anna 
Kochalko placed first in the 
400-yard IM in 4:50.77. Firstyear Rebecca Ussai won the 
100-yard butterfly in 1:01.33.
The mens team solidified 
its win by sweeping four of the 
events: the 1000-yard freestyle, 
200-yard freestyle, 400-yard 
IM, and 100-yard breast
stroke. Junior Tom McConnell 
won both the 500-yard and 
1000-yard freestyles in 4:48.58 
and 9:57.39, respectively. Se
nior Michael Bailey won the 
200-yard freestyle in 1:47.12, 
and senior student Patrick Sny
der won the 100-yard freestyle in 
48.77. Sophomore Jason Huber 
won the 100-yard breaststroke 
with a time of 1:00.25, leading 
the fourth sweep of the meet.
This past Saturday, the teams 
hosted the Allegheny Gators. 
The Tartan men defeated the
Gators 191-91, winning 11 
events and sweeping six, and 
the women won 162-129 with 
nine events. This weekends 
victories bring both teams to 
a 6-1 record in dual meets.
As is tradition at the last home 
dual meet, the seniors were rec
ognized for their dedication to 
the program over the past four 
years: Fourth-year architecture 
major Lauren Connell and se
niors Margaret Hebner, Anna 
Kochalko, Sarah Lam, Amy 
Pischke, Xiao-Lan Wong, Mi
chael Bailey, Andrew Douglass, 
Damian McIntyre, David Mohney, Braxton Satterfield, and 
Patrick Snyder were honored.
Its a great day for our se
niors. As happy as I am for them, 
Im sad to see them go. In their 
years here theyve added im
mensely to the program, said 
assistant coach Sara Pomaybo.
Its nice to have a meet 
where were recognized be
cause it adds a sense of closure 
to our swimming careers, se
nior Margaret Hebner said.
It was a great experience. A 
bunch of our parents came out to 
support us and help us through 
this emotional day, senior Doug
lass said. We cant show enough 
appreciation to the team, and 
God, I dont know how long it 
will take for the tears to stop.
In the first individual event 
for the women, the 1000-yard 
freestyle, first-year Noelle 
Helmstetter had a career-best 
11:14.93. Soon after, Evans 
lowered her school record time
in the 100-yard backstroke to 
58.51, followed later by a win 
in the 200-yard backstroke.
Two other female swimmers 
had double wins for the day: 
Lauren Connell (50- and 
100-yard freestyle) and 
firstyear design student Rebecca 
Ussai (100-yard/200-yard but
terfly). An impressive swim by 
senior Xiao-Lan Wong in the 
500-yard freestyle ended with 
a career-best time of 5:28.51.
The mens team also came out 
victoriously. Alex Hanson won the 
1000-yard freestyle in 10:00.92, 
a season-best for the firstyear.

200-yard freestyle event with a 
time of 1:47.36. The following

Mens basketball falls to Brandis and NYU
CASEY TAYLOR
Junior Staffwriter
It was a very happy holiday 
indeed for the Carnegie Mellon 
mens basketball team, which en
tered the second semester with a 
10-2 record. After the 50-64 loss 
to University Athletic Associa
tion (UAA) opponent University 
of Rochester, the mens basket
ball team got busy with a sevengame winning streak against 
non-conference opponents.
Despite a reputation as an 
offensively minded team, 
the Tartans got it done with 
tough defense over the break, 
never giving up more than 
65 points to an opponent.
The most notable victory 
came against 12th-ranked Capi
tal University in Columbus, 
Ohio. The team squeezed out a 
six-point victory in a hostile en
vironment, resulting in a 71-65 
win. The other schools that fell 
victim to the Carnegie Mellon 
steamroller were Christopher
Newport (83-63), La Roche 
(76-63), Juniata (65-57), Averett 
(70-62), and Lycoming (81-59).
It wasnt all smiles, however, as 
the Tartans lost sophomore ris
ing star Jack Anderson to a high 
ankle sprain. The Beaver Falls, 
Pennsylvania native has missed 
five games since getting injured 
in the game against La Roche.
Its tough losing Jack, but to 
come out of the break the way 
we did was huge, said junior 
forward Ryan Einwag. Now 
that we have the non-confer
ence games out of the way, 
we can focus on whats ahead 
and the UAA championship.
Einwag currently leads 
the team in scoring and aver
aged just under 17 points per 
game during the win streak.
The loss against the secondranked Judges of Brandeis 
University set Carnegie Mellon 
back. The Tartans suffered an
other abysmal shooting perfor
mance, scoring 27 percent from 
the floor in the first half and 35
percent for the game. The team 
scored a season-low 48 points.
We just couldnt get anything 
going, said Corey ORourke, a 
Junior who has been starting in 
place of the injured Anderson. It 
seemed like we were taking good 
shots, but nothing was falling.
The Tartans made a run after 
trailing by 15 at the half, clos
ing the gap to five after some hot 
shooting by Einwag and senior 
Geoff Kozak. However, in a close 
game with approximately 10 min
utes left, four of the Tartan start
ers were curiously on the bench.
The Judges capitalized and 
extended their lead to 10 within 
a minutes time. The lead did 
not drop below double dig
its for the rest of the game.
It looked like the team had a 
solid strategy forming during the 
run, with strong double teams 
on Brandeis leading scorer, Ter
rell Hollins, by junior Terrance 
Bouldin-Johnson and senior 
Greg Gonzalez. With Hollins 
neutralized and Einwag provid
ing solid defense on the Judges 
captain and second-leading 
scorer Joe Coppens, the Tartans 
were able to create turnovers 
and convert them into easy buck
ets. Their absence from the court 
at the 10-minute mark proved 
costly, as Hollins got back into 
a rhythm on the next two pos
sessions, converting one of two 
free throws and scoring on a 
lay-up from an assist by Coppens.
Carnegie Mellon never re
covered, watching with mouths 
agape as the Judges converted 
shot after shot and the Tar
tans made only one out of eight 
field goals before the coaching 
staff admitted defeat, pulling 
their starters with three min
utes to play in a 16-point game.
The minor speed bump against 
Brandeis turned into a brick wall 
against NYU, as the Tartans 
couldnt handle the zone defense 
that Violets coach Joe Nesci threw 
their way. The Tartans blew a

Carnegie Mellon womens 
basketball team hosted two 
University Athletic Association 
(UAA) teams this weekend: 
the Brandeis Judges on Friday, 
Jan. 18 and the New York 
University Violets on Sunday, 
Jan. 20. The Tartans fell to 
the Judges 56-74 and to the 
Violets 38-50. The Tartans 
even out their record to 7-7 
overall and 0-3 in the UAA.
Last week, The Tartan chatted with Stacie Aleski, a ju
nior guard. Aleski recorded 13 
points and three assists against 
Brandeis with 11 points and 
one assist against New York. 
Aleski has started all 14 games 
so far and leads the team with 
192 total points.
The Tartan: Did you get to 
enjoy the sun in Cancn for the 
Caribbean Hoops Showdown? 
What was the competition 
like?
Aleski: Cancn was amaz
ing and we did get to enjoy 
the sun and everything else 
the all-indusive Moon Palace 
Resort had to offer. The com
petition was good: University 
of LaVeme was from California 
and Concordia University was 
from Austin, Texas.
T: Are you in any dubs at 
CMU?
A: I am on SAAC
[Student Athletic Advisory 
Committee]. Basketball does 
take up a lot of my time but 
I would never give it up. The 
one thing that I would love 
to do is travel abroad for a se
mester, but because basketball 
is over both semesters I am 
unable to.
A: Yes, I wanted to play bas
ketball in college and receive 
a good education so CMU 
was a perfect fit. I am from 
Pittsburgh, so I like that I am 
dose to home and that my fam
ily can come watch me play. 
I love going to any sporting 
event in Pittsburgh because it 
is always entertaining and the 
Pittsburgh fans are great!
T: What made you decide to 
double major in public policy 
and decision science? What do 
you plan on doing after you 
graduate?
A: I chose dedsion science 
because I enjoy psychology, 
and dedsion sdence allowed 
me to take several interest
ing psychology dasses. After I 
graduate I would like to move 
out of Pittsburgh, somewhere 
where it is warm all the time, 
and maybe work for the gov
ernment.
T: What do you think can 
be done in order to improve 
the athletic experience at 
Carnegie Mellon?
A: A new basketball facility.
T: How do you cultivate 
school spirit here?
A: As part of SAAC, we try 
to bring not only all the ath
letes together but everyone 
on campus. For example, the 
White Out Night was a SAAC 
project.
T: Do you follow any profes
sional teams? Are you exdted 
about the Olympics?
A: I love the Steelers. The 
Olympics are always fun to 
watch. Basketball, track, and 
gymnastics are my favorite to 
watch.
T: Did you have an athletic 
role model growing up? What 
do you think of the Marion 
Jones scandal?
A: Growing up, I had an 
athletic role model for each 
sport I played, but currently it 
would be Hines Ward. Marion 
Jones has disappointed all of 
her fans and it is only fair to 
her competitors that she has 
to return her Olympic medals 
and other awards.
T: How would you feel if 
your role model was found us
ing performance-enhandng 
drugs?
A: I would be disappointed, 
performance-enhancingdrugs 
take away from the awe of a 
truly great athlete.
T: What do you think of the 
new Will Ferrell movie about 
basketball coming out?
A: I really havent heard 
anything about it but I like 
anything with Will Ferrell so it 
should be a good one.
T: Did basketball factor Aleski and teammates hit the
into your decision of coming road to take on Case Western 
to Carnegie Mellon? What do this Friday, Jan. 25 at 6 p.m. 
you like about Pittsburgh?

Everything you need to know
About being under 21 and out of cash
"We went first to [Washington,] D.C., then to 
Baltimore, then we went to New York  we saw them 
twice in New York  then we went to see them in 
Pittsburgh on the next Tuesday, and then the next 
night we went to Columbus, Ohio... on a whim, said 
sophomore art major Andrea Meythaler, ticking off the 
list of Sound Tribe Sector 9 concerts she attended over 
a three-week period last fall.
"And then recently 1 saw them four times in Atlanta," 
she added, referring to the four consecutive concerts 
that STS9 played at the Tabernacle, a concert venue 
in Atlanta, Ga., in the days surrounding New Years 
Eve.
Judging by the hordes of drum-whacking, 
glowstick-wielding, mellow-eyed concertgoers that 
filled the cavernous expanse of the century-old 
church, Meythaler represented a nearly infinitesimal 
percentage of the Santa-Cruz-by-way-of-Atlanta 
quintets fan base that converged in Atlanta on the 
first night of the concert series. All four nights of the 
Atlanta shows sold out days in advance, attesting 
to 10 years of STS9s escalating popularity along the 
jam band and electrnica circuits. Such devoted 
audiences for a band that has yet to release a 
recognizable single may seem perplexing, but the live 
music experience that STS9 engenders accounts for 
the thousands of listeners who are moths to the flame 
of epic improvised compositions that arise according 
to the audiences mood.
STS9's keyboardist, bassist, and guitarist manipulate 
electronic samples throughout the show, elevating 
the performance from a jam band set to a full-fledged 
spectacle complete with a light show, live art, 
independent vendors, and the unbroken raw energy 
of a hyperkinetic crowd. Though groups such as 
Lotus, The Pnuma Trio, The Disco Biscuits, and 
Infected Mushroom channel genres similar to STS9, 
the Atlanta quintet belongs to a class of its own. Its 
appeal comes from the universality of the message 
behind the art  that music's creative merit depends

on the emotions that it evokes from the listener. 
An STS9 concert brings together people who love 
hip-hop, rave, electrnica, and dance music, and 
the band attracts concertgoers demanding more 
than an hour-long set and the possibility of an 
encore.
The band indulges its audience and keeps 
them wanting more. As a service to its fans, 
most tickets range between $20 and $30. One 
especially enthused attendee at the opening 
night of the Tabernacle shows burst forth 
through the entrance to commemorate his 50th 
STS9 sighting. Another devotee, Sam Belanger, 
a second-year architecture major, described 
the bands genre-bending sound. STS9 is the 
evolution of music through the combination of 
genres," Belanger said. Theres always been a 
disconnect between the hippie scene and the 
raver scene, and they can pull from multiple 
influences for their songs and have it turn out 
perfectly.
The debut concert at the Tabernacle ended in 
a bombastic symphony in vivid color played by 
five instruments and three digital turntables. 
When the crowd shuffled out of the venue in high 
spirits, fans continued to feed on the prevailing 
positive vibes that the concert environment 
harnessed.
The festivals first concert, held Dec. 28, marked 
a modern-day happening, a truly unparalleled 
intersection of technology and free-form music.
At this stage in STS9s rapid emergence, 
bass-playing frontman David Murphy  whose 
fans affectionately call him "Murph  would be 
humbled to hear Belanger dub STS9 masters of 
ceremony, time, and sound.

Dear Rachael,
Its the spring of my junior year, 
and my friends have started 
turning 21. Now, I would be 
celebrating, but whats there to 
cheer about when my birthday 
isnt until September? What am 
I supposed to do for the next 
eight months while pretty much 
everyone I like is bar-hopping?
Sober in Skibo
Dear SIS,
First of all, if youre going to be 
sober and mopey, you shouldnt 
do it in Sklbo. Its not a good look. 
The frozen yogurt might tempt 
you, but its best to take that 
order to go. More importantly, did 
AlcoholEdu teach you nothing? 
If you want to be around other 
people that cant or shouldnt 
be drinking, get younger friends. 
Or older friends in AA meetings. 
Mostly, not being 21 is not a huge 
deal.
Theres also the option of 
discovering other vices  and no, 
Im not talking about the illegal 
ones. Maybe you can be the kind 
of person who sleeps a lot or 
watches Maury and Jerry Springer 
faithfully. Or, think about exploring 
your options with your friends 
born after May  bars arent even 
that great. Sometimes they are 
filled with creepy old men, and 
they are usually no parts fun and 
all parts sketch.
Word to yo mama!
Rachael
Dear Rachael,
Assuming all goes well, Ill 
be graduating at the end of 
the semester. Ive been lucky 
enough to have parents who 
financially cover all the bare 
necessities of life. Theyve 
taught me fiscal responsibility
 theyve made me work since 
I was 13, and half of every 
paycheck had to be deposited 
into the bank  but somewhere 
between starting college and 
ending college Ive become 
irresponsible with my money, 
and theirs, too. Do you have
any suggestions for how to get 
back on track?
Pretty Obviously Out of 
Riches
POOR my love!
Being poor sucks, dont it? 
Welcome to life. I think extremes 
often work when trying to get 
yourself back on track. Do you have 
a job? If not, get one. It doesnt 
matter what kind, although I would 
avoid the morally questionable  
yes, hitmen get paid well, but they 
always get caught. Try to get a job 
on campus or in the immediate 
area, and work as many hours as 
you can.
Have you ever thought about 
becoming a rapper? Consider 
it. Although, in retrospect, that 
may take longer than you have. 
Youre best off working at your 
favorite caf. And to save money, 
you should go on a kind of diet: 
Dont consume things that arent 
free. Carnegie Mellon always 
has plenty of events going on 
with different organizations  so 
join up and get a free meal while 
youre at it. Youll learn and you 
wont starve! Besides, water is 
free, and that chai latte youve 
been thinking about isnt. Or you 
could always be less extreme and 
just cut back  only dine out if 
its half-off, or get some coffee 
and make it at home instead of 
running to Starbucks. Dont buy 
things you dont need, and if you 
do really need a sweater, get it 
from Avalon. In a few weeks, youll 
have money in the bank, and youll 
have taught yourself what Its like 
to be without money, something 
that will undoubtedly happen if 
you continue this irresponsibility. 
It may even be a good idea to go 
back to depositing half of your 
check in the bank again, after 
youve taught yourself a good 
lesson. Furthermore, it will set 
you up for the rules of financial 
independence for your post
graduation adventures.
Do it well!

Brittany welcomes student journalists
French government promotes tourism with Festivales Transmusicales
The French Government Tourist Office saw the Festivales 
Transmusicales in Brittany, France as a good opportunity to 
show American student journalists what the music scene in 
France is like, as well as to promote a smaller region in France 
that doesn't get much media attention. For the journalists 
attending, the weekend was a mix of sightseeing, 
concert-going, eating, talking to locals, and exploring.
And though most tourists go to Paris, the few days spent 
in Brittany proved that its a great place for outsiders, 
particularly for young people. Here is the best food from the 
trip, as well as the highlights from each city visited.
Cities
You can find the region of Brittany poking out of the 
Northwest part of France. A large area with almost 5 million 
people, Brittany has an impressive breadth of character in 
its cities. During the weekend, visiting journalists traveled 
to several of the cities in the region, each one with its own 
distinct flavor. Within Brittany, theres a large diversity of 
things to do, especially for young people, from beach sports to 
jazz clubs, and the people are nice everywhere you go. Here 
are the highlights from each city.
Rennes
Rennes is the capital of Brittany, with about 600,000 people 
living in the metropolitan area. Though this is significantly 
smaller than Pittsburgh, Rennes is well centralized, meaning 
that most landmarks are either in walking distance of most 
hotels or a short bus ride away. This serves the city well, 
considering that 20 percent of the population is college

students. Like Pittsburgh, the city tailors itself culturally to 
the large student population. There are both upscale and 
moderately priced restaurants, as well as art museums, 
concert halls, and jazz clubs. A great hangout in Rennes is 
Rue St. Michel, which is kind of like Craig Street on steroids. 
Packed to the brim with restaurants and bars, this narrow 
cobblestone street is a fabulous spot to grab a beer with 
friends or people-watch if youre flying solo.
Saint-Malo
Saint-Malo is a beautiful port city Brittany. Unlike the more 
built-up, urban city of Rennes, Saint-Malo has soothingly 
quiet cobblestone streets and charming buildings that are 
rarely higher than two stories. This small city is lined with 
rustic walls that date back to its military days; today these 
walls help keep the mainland dry, since the water that 
surrounds the city fluctuates rapidly between high and low 
tide. Since Saint-Malo is on the water, the city, and especially 
one house that was once home to a successful French 
tradesman, became a hub for lucrative trade deals. At one 
point, this house held 10 percent of France's GNP in money 
and spices. Today, the house offers tours to the public, and is 
definitely worth checking out. Other interesting parts of the 
city include its beautiful streets, which, like Rue St. Michel 
in Rennes, are small and almost exclusively cobblestone. 
However, its loquacious atmosphere is met with great 
restaurants, as well as plenty of fashionable clothing stores.
Quiberon
Travelers looking for a little sun and relaxation during their 
visit to Brittany should stop by Quiberon. The city is at the tip 
of a peninsula in the south of Brittany and, like Saint-Malo, 
is along the water. However, its not walled in, and instead 
has massive beaches and cliffs that let you get right into 
the ocean. During the summer, Quiberon is a fabulous place 
for ocean swimmers and lovers of water sports. During the 
winter, these activities are sometimes unavailable because 
of the weather conditions, but the heavy winds make for 
beautifully massive waves that remind you of The Perfect 
Storm, or perhaps even a Monet painting.
Food
Breton food is both innovative and tasty. Unlike regular French 
food, Breton food is unique in its twists on standard dishes. 
Even when dishes sound excessive, the concoctions end 
up blending together modestly for a satisfying experience. 
Another fabulous quality of French dining is the patience 
of the experience. Meals will often take two hours, with as 
much as a 15-minute break between the appetizer and the 
mam course. This is great when you're with friends; you don't 
feel rushed out of the restaurant, nor do you feel like youre 
inhaling your food, which usually results in an unpleasantly 
stuffed feeling at the end of the meal.. In addition, the service
at Breton restaurants is much more pleasant than at cafs in 
Paris, where waiters are frequently irritated by Americans. 
Here are a few standout dishes from the weekend, with the 
restaurant's name and region in Brittany included.
Caf Breton, Rennes
Though "surf and turf  a combination of steak and shrimp
 is a popular dish in the States, it is interpreted slightly 
differently in Brittany. Caf Breton calls the dish Mli Mlo 
The restaurant swaps steak for veal, which gives the dish 
a lighter feel. The switch might be a little disappointing for 
fans of the heavy and intense taste of steak, but here the 
shrimp and veal are served over a lively risotto, which mixes 
in perfectly. Surprisingly, there's no sauce or gravy on 
at all. Instead, the juice from the veal and the cream on the 
risotto provide enough moisture to make the dish a savory 
treat.
La Brigantine, Saint-Malo
Unbeknownst to most Americans, Brittany is actually the 
hometown of the famous French galettes, thin pancakes 
served with anything from onions to sausage. When served 
with sweeter foods like chocolate, it is known worldwide 
as crepes. In Brittany, galettes are made with buckwheat, 
as opposed to white wheat, which is more commonly used 
in other parts of France and worldwide. At La Brigantine, a 
three-course meal is the norm. You start the meal off with 
a simple butter galette to warm up your taste buds. Then, 
for the main course, you order something more elaborate, 
perhaps a galette stuffed with fresh peppers, mushrooms, and 
sauted onions, with two slices of fresh ham on the outside 
of the pancake. For dessert, perhaps a crepe stuffed with 
caramel ice cr
Le Bistro de Marin, Quiberon
Since Quiberon is right by the water, its only fitting to visit a 
seafood restaurant. Particularly memorable is a combination 
platter, called L'Assiette Marin, which includes everything 
from oysters to winkles (small snails). Though some of. the 
platter is tough to eat  you have to use a thin fork to scrape
out the little snails...the smooth texture of the oysters and
the chewiness of the clams make for a salty and delicious 
meal.

Get your groove on
Festivales Transmusicales bumps through Rennes
Europeans love to dance, and at the Festivales 
Transmusicales  which took place Dec. 6 through
8 in Rennes  the sentiment was no different. Even 
though the dance-pop craze in America has been 
rejuvenated in the past few years by the likes of LCD 
Soundsystem and Justice, it has never really gone 
away in Europe.
This weekends festival, which used vacant airplane 
hangars as stages, showcased this European 
enthusiam accordingly. Though there were no 
official headlining acts, Friday night belonged to 
local French DJ Etienne de Crecy, who emerged on 
stage elevated in a massive white cube. Starting off 
with just the pulsing blare of a fire alarm, de Crecy 
barreled through a set of beats so ferocious you could 
feel the thudding in your heart. You danced, whether 
you liked it or not (... you liked it).
Though the presence of French musicians and 
audience members was undoubtedly felt, it 
has always been a Transmusicales tradition to 
promote both younger groups and groups from 
other countries. Dancing audience members got to 
take a breather for Mexican guitar duo Rodrigo y 
Gabriela, two technical powerhouses of the acoustic 
guitar. With the Spanish influence came original 
tunes rooted in rhythmic Flamenco patterns, while 
the musicians' heavier rock roots led them as far 
as covering Metallica tunes. A one-man act from 
Copenhagen, Prins Nitram, decorated his stage with 
a La-Z-Boy chair and a reading lamp. "Welcome to 
my living room, he announced. Nitrams music had 
a Grizzly Bear-influenced vibe; he would frequently
loop guitars and overdub bass lines for relaxed, 
ethereal effects. Occasionally, he would try out his 
musical bravado and funk out, playing both bass and 
drums at the same time (he should stick to guitar).
But the real focus of the weekend was worldwide 
stomp, and there was plenty of it. The Whip, from 
Manchester, UK, pieced together simple, rhythmic 
vocal lines with guitar patterns and drumbeats that 
were just as kinesthetic. Another British smash at 
the festival was Calvin Harris, who, like The Whip, 
always threw down catchy beats and grooves.
Harris, however, got lost much less frequently in 
thick synthesizer lines and electrnica monotony; 
he and his group kept catchy vocal hooks and bass 
lines popping throughout the set. His young age 
(he's 24), however, often makes for ridiculous lyrics. 
He constantly reminds us that he gets all the girls, 
as well as proclaiming that "merrymaking and drug 
taking take place at his house.
Then again, criticizing drug-taking, love-making, 
and being brash would completely undermine 
the (French) music festival experience. Festivales 
Transmusicales was an absolute party, with friendly 
vibes and music that only enhanced them. Sure, 
suspicious activity took place, but by the early 
morning hours of Saturday, the highs and vices just 
seemed like byproducts of good music and a good 
time.

dio stationOn Keith Jarrett
Over the holiday break, my sister got a CD from our parents as a gift, Keith 
Jarrett's Paris Concert, i had heard some Keith Jarrett here and there at 
home since my dad has a few of his CDs, but I hadn't paid much attention to 
him. I knew that he played jazz as well as classical music, and I remembered 
recently that I had been listening to Arvo Parts Tabula Rasa, on which Jarrett 
plays piano, for much of last semester. So, I made a mental note to listen to 
Jarretts CD, especially its 38-minute long improvisation.
I heard bits and pieces of this improvisation over the next few days as my 
sister listened to it now and then, but I didnt listen to it fully until I was in the 
car, on my way back from New Hampshire. I borrowed my sister's iPod, put it 
on, and promptly fell asleep listening within five minutes. I woke up suddenly;
I was in the middle of thundering piano chords. The sustain pedal had been 
welded down and Jarretts left hand was laying the bedrock for the right to 
carefully play a tender melody over it. I was quite moved. I thought of two 
things. First, it sounded like rock piano-playing to me. It was almost cheesy 
how strongly it appealed to my emotions. Second, I wondered  as Jarrett 
delicately ended the piece with beautiful arpeggios  how he could have 
possibly ended up here after starting the piece in such a straightforward 
way.
Listening to the piece over and over reveals how Jarrett gently moves from 
one style to the next as he plays. He starts the piece in a baroque fashion, 
following general rules of counterpoint handed down from before Bachs 
time. As he begins the improvisation, melodies come and go to him and he 
chooses which ones to pursue. Some are simply diversions, and at other 
points you can hear him forcefully repeat a phrase a few times, hesitating 
before launching off into something new. You can tell that hes waiting for an 
idea to arrive.
Its interesting to see a contemporary pianist who very much enjoys classical 
improvisation, an art which has seemingly disappeared over the last century. 
In Milos Formans Amadeus film, there are many scenes with Mozart gaily 
improvising in the way we now think of jazz musicians doing the same. It was 
a really common skill that many musicians had in that time, and I personally 
would love to see it regain its lost popularity. Unfortunately, current education 
on classical instruments emphasizes pure performance from written work. 
Even cadenzas, small improvised sections of music in classical pieces, have 
now been written out by professionals. A student now learns a cadenza by 
reading and memorizing it. As a result, there is no difference between it and 
the rest of the composed piece.
The reason for this decline in classical improvisation is hard to explain. My 
only hope is that, with time, this old art can be rediscovered and taught to 
a new generation of classical musicians who can advance it the same way 
as Jarrett.

Taking audiences back to the past
Hesperus performs at silent showing of The Hunchback of Notre Dame
Quasimodo, after being unjustly sentenced to a public 
whipping, experiences kindness for the first time from a 
stranger, as Esmeralda gives him a drink of water and helps 
him into his clothes. Eventually, Esmeralda is framed for 
stabbing Phoebus by Jehan and sentenced to death. It is 
then that Quasimodo repays his debt and saves her from 
execution, giving her sanctuary inside Angelus Church. Led 
by Clopin, an army of beggars storms the church to take back 
Esmeralda and repay the nobility. Quasimodo fends off the 
beggars from the roof and saves Esmeralda, who is reunited 
with Phoebus. He dies as he rings the bells for the last time.
Originally, silent films were not viewed in silence, but with 
musical accompaniment, whether by a single, improvising 
pianist or a larger group of musicians following a score.
The current silent film revival finds many musicians 
taking up these old positions, thus tackling the problem of 
accompaniment. As explained by Hesperus members before 
the screening, some musicians go back to find a films original 
score and reconstruct it. Others take up the task of writing
The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust and the Renaissance & Baroque 
Society presented the film The Hunchback of Notre Dame 
Jan. 19, featuring a live score performed by musical group 
Hesperus. This one-day event took place Downtown at the 
Byham Theater.The 1923 silent film version of The Hunchback 
of Notre Dame, directed by Wallace Worsley, stars Lon 
Chaney as Quasimodo and Patsy Ruth Miller as 
Esmeralda and is one of the more famous film 
adaptations of Victor Hugo's novel of the same 
name. Hesperus, a local group of collaborative, 
performing musicians, worked to invigorate the 
show through a variety of programs presenting 
many different musical genres and fusions.
a brand new score, in styles that range from jazz to atonal 
music. The very brave even improvise the whole score as they 
watch the film on a piano, to give audiences that authentic 
20s feel.
Hesperus, on the other hand, with a mission to connect
The Hunchback of Notre Dame was Universals 
most successful silent film, grossing over $3 
million and earning the studio's "Super Jewel 
title. It was this film that further raised Lon 
Chaneys already elevated status in Hollywood.
The film is known for both Chaneys acting and
make-up, which would influence future horror
films, as well as its spectacular sets that recreate 15th-century
Paris.
The film begins by introducing each key character during 
the Festival of Fools, an annual event in which Parisians 
could indulge without worries of monarchical oppression. It 
is during this festival that the gypsy Esmeralda is first seen 
by both Captain Phoebus (Norman Kerry) and Quasimodo. 
After the festival, Captain Phoebus and Esmeralda fall in love, 
causing Clopin (Ernest Torrence), the King of the Beggars, 
and Jehan (Brandon Hurst), the sinful brother of the Reverend, 
to proceed to try to break them apart  Clopin out of fatherly 
love corrupted by contempt for the nobility and Jehan out 
of sheer, vicious jealousy. In the midst of this 15th-century 
amalgam of love, lust, and social commentary is Quasimodo, 
the deformed, half-blind, and deaf slave mocked by all of 
Paris and abused by his master, Jehan. A hateful and bitter 
creature," Quasimodo lives in the Angelus church, his only 
joy and outlet being the ringing of the tower bells.
Watching a silent film with musical 
accompaniment is a grander event than 
watching anything in a modern theater... 
the experience is much more alive.
the past to the present, tackled the problem with an eye for 
musical history. As the film was set in 15th-century France, 
the four-member Hesperus performed music from the 14th 
and 15th centuries, and expanded the repertoire to include 
works from the 16th century. They featured well-known 
masters such as Guillame de Machaut, Jehan l'Escurel, 
Guillaume Dufay, and lesser-known composers such as 
Vaillant, Morton, and Borlet. To add to the authenticity of the 
period, they performed on replicas of period instruments, 
including a lute, vielle (a bowed-string instrument similar 
to the modern violin), and a series of wooden recorders. The 
strings of some instruments were made of the lining of sheep
organs, as they would have in the 15th century, so Hesperus 
member Grant Herreid added with lament, "Unfortunately, we 
must say that some animals were harmed for the making of 
this event."
Watching a silent film with musical accompaniment is a 
grander event than watching anything in a modern theater. 
The combination provides two spectacles, that of film and 
that of the musicians. It also gives the added effect of being in 
a concert, so the experience is much more alive. The senses 
are much more engaged, making it a giddier affair. If theaters 
still played films with live and varied musicians, just imagine 
the value of re-watching.
Hesperus created theme music for each character, and 
put together a score that hoped to also highlight irony and 
emotion. The main flaw in Hesperus performance was 
the lack of a powerful bell. The scenes where Lon Chaney 
madly and vigorously rings the church bell is ruined with 
the juxtaposition of a palm-sized, puny, and almost inaudible 
Tibetan prayer bell. Additionally, Hesperus' attempt at irony 
by playing festive music alongside violence in one scene was 
just plain awkward, even uncalled for, although the group 
did accept commentary at the end of the performance so 
they could improve the score. Despite these two flaws, the 
performance was worthwhile. Besides, the film stars Lon 
Chaney, which is reason enough to watch, with or without 
live musical accompaniment.

Cloverfield: Its alive
Mystery monster smashes into theaters
"I saw it! It's alive! Its huge!" These immortal words, spoken 
by a fleeing New Yorker, raised questions about just what 
is alive and how huge it actually is. Well, we finally have an 
answer. The never-ending guessing games are over with last 
Fridays release of the much-anticipated science fiction film 
Cloverfield.
Before production for the movie even began, a teaser trailer 
was produced and shown before Transformers back in July 
of 2007. In addition, Paramount Pictures and producer J.J. 
Abrams, creator of the hit television shows Lost and Alias, 
decided against including a title with the original trailer, 
showing its release date instead. The teaser trailer, which 
depicts a group of people at a going-away party who witness 
the destruction of New York City, caused quite a stir with its 
sudden appearance, leading to rampant speculation on the 
films title, plot, and, of course, the monster.
Fascinated, hordes of fans began to analyze and investigate 
every available nanosecond of the movie; Cloverfield-ieiaied 
videos on YouTube have been viewed well over 10 million 
times. Theories on the identity of the monster have ranged 
from Godzilla, the mythical beast Cthulu, to something 
completely original, and some even believed the movie was 
a spin-off of Abrams's TV show Lost. Fueling the Internet 
frenzy sparked by the trailer was the studio's viral marketing 
campaign. Abrams himself stated that various websites had 
been created as clues about the movie's plot, beginning a 
veritable scavenger hunt for information. However, the great
unknown, the actual identity of the monster, remained secret, 
stuffed away from the ever-prying public eye. That is, until 
now.
The movie begins in ominous fashion, with a rhythmic 
pounding much like the scene in Jurassic Park right before 
the T-Rex appears. It sets the mood for a beast of epic 
proportions, but first we meet the men and women who 
may or may not be the victims of horrific deaths. Early on 
we learn just enough about these people so we care about 
what happens to them. The dialogue is well-written and 
snappy, and the more-or-less unknown actors do a fine job of 
exhibiting the main emotions of the film: utter confusion, fear 
of the unknown, and sadness for all the lives lost.
The movie focuses on six main characters: Rob, the sincere 
lead who is leaving for Japan; Jason, Robs brother; Lily, 
Jasons girlfriend; Hud, the cameraman and comic relief; 
Marlena, Huds crush; and Beth, Robs crush. We discover 
that things are complicated between Rob and Beth as Beth 
leaves the party early to go home to her apartment. Soon 
after, the party is interrupted by a power failure. As the party 
gathers on the roof to see whats going on, a giant explosion 
rocks Manhattan and the group flees from falling debris. A 
fierce battle between the military and the beast rages on, and 
our group encounters both sides of the battle in its journey 
to rescue Beth, who has fallen and cant get up, but for good 
reason. Hud keeps the camera in tow, giving a chilling sense 
of realism to the viewer.
The effects are absolutely astounding, displaying the 
destruction of Manhattan to an inconceivable degree. 
Buildings crumble and explosions vibrate the theater as 
the military goes all-out in an attempt to save Manhattan. 
Nothing is safe; even the Statue of Liberty gets a makeover. 
The film is shot entirely with a handheld camera, resulting in 
extreme camera movement at times, mostly during scenes of 
utmost horror. Those who get dizzy or queasy easily may want 
to exercise caution.
For any fan of monster movies, Cloverfield is a must-see.
It displays the elements of the monster-movie genre to 
perfection while retaining a surprising sense of realism. 
Boundaries are pushed, but nothing is over the top. The 
monster looks and acts like a destructive force, reacting 
angrily to human attack. When people die, they die; there are 
no touching goodbyes. Every person on screen is scared and 
confused, each as vulnerable as the next, and those feelings 
manage to creep into the audience as well. One basic idea 
passes through everyone's head: Some thing is attacking the 
city, and chances of survival are falling with every passing 
minute.
This is Cloverfield. A gripping tale of human survival that 
refuses to let go.

The King of Kong: 
A Fistful of Quarters
Thursday, January 24

Who knew that an arcade game 
could make boys into men?
This documentary follows two 
men as they score 874,300 
points and then 1,000,000 
points, each time breaking a 
world record  and, of course, 
discovering and rediscovering 
themselves along the way. The 
documentary follows fans of the 
popular 80s arcade game and 
tugs at the heart strings as well. 
Perfect for the nerd inside you, 
and that nerds girlfriend.
The Darjeeling 
Limited
Friday, January 25 
8 10 12
Unmistakably Anderson-ian 
(as in, Wes); beautiful colors, 
awkward characters, and 
a confusing and perhaps 
deceptively profound storyline. 
Three brothers reunite on a train 
in India in an attempt to deal with 
the loss of their father and find 
out what kind of family they can 
be. They learn a bunch of things 
along the way about death and 
themselves, blah blah blah. I 
liked the movie, and I think most 
people with siblings, and most 
Wes Anderson fans, will like it.
As for the actors: Bill Murray.only 
makes a cameo appearance, 
and this movie made me like 
Adrien Brody and hate Natalie 
Portman all over again.
The Kingdom
Saturday, January 26 
8 10 12
The Kingdom is probably better 
than you expect it to be. Its hard 
to make a movie about timely 
and relevant matters seem... 
not trite, especially when they 
star Jamie Foxx. The movies 
initial storyline plays on popular 
American fears about terrorism 
in the Middle East, but offers 
a different (if not entirely fresh) 
conclusion. Plus, stuff still gets 
blown up. And, for those of you 
who miss Jennifer Garners Alias 
days, you get to see her kick 
some ass.
Tron
Sunday, January 27 
8 10 12
Tron is a nerdy cult-classic that's 
made its way into the pop culture 
dialogue (i.e., they talk about it in 
The Simpsons and Family Guy).
The tagline for this movie is, The 
electronic gladiator. I think thats 
illustrative enough, but Ill continue 
anyway. This movie broke ground 
in the 80s with a character who 
gets molecularized and sucked into 
a computer world. He can only be 
saved by a security program. Too 
bad Norton and McAfee werent 
around then.

Now and Later: An
Plastic Poetics opens at Miller Gallery
Exhibit showcases fusion of text and images
Plastic Poetics, an exhibition that showcases the creations 
of artists Ian Finch, Maya Schindler, Sarah E. Wood, and 
Colin Zaug, opened last Friday at the Regina Gouger Miller 
Gallery. Cara Erskine, exhibitions coordinator of the gallery 
and curator of the exhibit, has brought together a group of 
unique artists, each offering different and equally intriguing 
styles of work.
I wanted a title that would talk about the materials that were 
in the show, Erskine said, referring to the exhibits diverse 
canvasses, from inflatable plastic to household plants. "One 
of the things I was really attracted to was seizing those real 
materials and their transformation to make spaces."
Each artist is known for his or her unique type of work.
Finch is renowned for his Venn diagram poems; Zaug for his 
inflatable landscapes; Schindler for her connection between 
art and text; and Wood for her work with black rubber, vinyl, 
and plastic to create shadows. Zaug, Schindler, and Wood 
each have a floor dedicated to their work while Finch's 
poems travel up the gallery walls, forming a connection 
between the exhibits.
Plastic Poetics's first piece looks something like a large 
white shifting cloud. This moving structure is actually a 
piece of special white plastic, called Tyvek, kept inflated by 
an industrial fan. It has an opening through which visitors 
can enter and, once inside, sit on a wooden bench and peep 
through an eyehole to the outside world. This mysterious 
inflatable landscape is the work of Zaug.
"These inflatables came out of work that was sort of about 
blanking something out or making a white nothingness, 
Zaug said. Despite his effort to "blank out," Zaug still wanted 
his pieces to have a big physical presence, creating an 
interesting conflict.
Zaug has created such pieces before, but this piece is his 
first that can be entered and viewed from the inside. The wall 
next to Zaug's exhibit features poems by Finch that spout 
words and phrases like thought bubble, "looms," winds," 
and glimmerer's glean."
Visitors on the second floor are greeted by a pink and green 
wall mural with the words "wishful thinking" stenciled 
all over them. What is interesting about this exhibit by 
Schindler is that, although the words on the wall appear 
green, they are actually white. For this piece, her first wall 
mural, Schindler used color theory to create the illusion of 
green from the pink around the words. Schindler, a non
native speaker of English, has a different view on many 
English phrases including wishful thinking, million in 
one, and the benefit of the doubt, inspiring her to create 
works of art around them.
My work is text based, Schindler said. [Its] not just text,
its about how we relate to text. My inspiration comes from 
everywhere, [like] popular culture [and] my understanding of 
language."
She has a really fresh perspective on English expressions," 
said Erskine. I think they are really rye, humorous 
observations." Schindlers art conveys her ideas in part by 
establishing a connection between text and images.
The mood of Plastic Poetics changes on the exhibit's last 
floor, where Woods work creates a different effect than the 
other artists pieces. Unlike the other floors, this one contains 
pieces that are completely black, depicting shadows of 
various objects, ranging from houseplants to hanging 
structures.
"For me it is about taking something thats familiar and 
changing it til it becomes unfamiliar," said Wood. She 
accomplished this with houseplants, which, although 
recognizable, become strangely bizarre in her art. This 
disconnection is evident in her other pieces as well, which 
depict objects with their shadows; oddly, the shadows and 
objects don't match up with each other.
In particular, Im interested in shadows and how shadows 
behave," Wood said. Her favorite piece is the shadow from 
a window. "I think, for me, this is sort of the most concise 
about what I am trying to do." Wood's work was popular 
among onlookers, many of them calling it their favorite 
exhibit.
Finch's poems continue on these walls as well, relating to the 
exhibit with phrases like under your penumbra" (another 
word for shadow) and creased photo of space time. Plastic 
Poetics was the first opportunity for Finch, a local artist, to 
display his poetry on a surface other than paper.
The response for the opening was very warm, with interested 
observers milling everywhere and enjoying the art and 
surrounding music.

i Exhibit of Galleries
Calling all Heathers
What is a Heather? A flower, a color, and sometimes an 
artist. Heathers in the latter category are coming together 
to create an exhibit for Future Tenant, a Penn Avenue art 
gallery. Th exhibit, titled I-am-a-Heather," aims to explore 
the influence of naming while showcasing a collection of 
Heather-created art.
"We're looking for art by or about Heathers, said Heather 
Mallak, the exhibit curator and creative director. Mallak is in 
the process of recruiting 12 Heathers to submit their art to 
the exhibit. She hopes to reach artists of diverse ages from 
Pittsburgh and beyond.
We wanted to open it up to the Heathers in Pittsburgh 
first," said communications coordinator Heather Jarrett, 
adding that the exhibit has already found several artists. 
Now, Jarrett is preparing to broaden the exhibit's marketing 
to reach cities in and out of the country. "We 
want to make the show as diverse as possible," 
she said.
Part of the exhibits appeal is its examination of naming, 
a subject that all visitors can relate to. In addition to the 
artwork itself, its important that the artist tells a story about 
her name," Jarrett said.
Powell associates her name with a Scottish myth about a 
pining widow. In the myth, the widows tears turn a string of 
purple heather flowers to white, making them lucky.
Along with such personal stories, the exhibit should inspire 
Heathers and others to consider how naming might affect  
or predict  character.
"When I hear that somebody is named Heather, I dont think
of physical characteristics, Jarrett said. I assume them to 
be slightly edgier, slightly more outgoing."
Heathers contributing to the exhibit do not have 
to be artists by profession, Mallak said. I think 
its fair to say [we
want art by] someone whos expressive. Mallak 
plans to use the submitted art to make 12 
oversized prints, in addition to creating a flowerfilled field of Heathers" using Heather-owned 
clothing.
Still, I-am-a-Heather" extends to artists by other names as 
well. Mallak found a Chicago band called Baby Teeth (with 
members Abraham, Jim, and Peter) with an EP called For 
the Heathers, full of Heather-themed songs. Enthusiastic 
about the exhibit, the band will perform in Pittsburgh to 
coincide with the exhibits opening in April. And this was 
just through Googling," Mallak said.
Even more than artists, Mallak and Jarrett are passionate 
about welcoming visitors of all kinds. We printed out 
[promotional] cards that say 'Art for anyone with a name, 
Jarrett said. "We're going to have a high level of audience 
participation at the show itself." 1-am-a-Heather will 
include interactive computers for visitors to look up the 
origins of their own names, along with a giant "Hello my 
name is sign to write on. "There are things that will allow 
people to leave their mark on the show, she said.
I think the overall experience will be interesting for 
everyone, added Heather Powell, the first Heather to sign 
up as a contributing artist.
Heathers love themselves, Powell 
added. [Creating this exhibit] seems 
like kind of a Heather thing to do.
"Heathers love themselves, Powell added. [Creating this 
exhibit] seems like kind of a Heather thing to do.
Mallak proposed the I-am-a-Heather exhibit after Future 
Tenant invited her to do a show. The gallery, known for its 
eccentric art, should offer an appropriate venue for such an 
open-ended exhibit.
It seems to be that the Future Tenant mission statement is 
to house a creative experiment," Jarrett said. And I think 
that is perfect for the Heather show.

The "I-am-a-Heather" submission deadline is Feb. 19. Those 
interested in entering art should visit www.i-am-a-heather.

819 Penn Ave.

Baba ghanooj and homemade hummus
Ali Baba hits the spot for traditional Middle Eastern food
Great Middle Eastern food isnt always easy to find, but it 
isn't due to a lack of restaurants offering Middle Eastern or 
Mediterranean menu choices. Ali Baba, located on South 
Craig Street, is one of many on the long list of restaurants 
hoping to make the cut. Ali Baba is open every day for lunch 
and dinner (leaving a middle-of-the-day period 
thats inconvenient if youre craving hummus or baba 
ghanooj).
The first thing to greet you upon entering this small 
restaurant, besides the checkout counter, is a wall full of 
awards for best Middle Eastern restaurant in Pittsburgh, given 
to Ali Baba by various publications. The restaurant is pretty 
dark inside, and while not very big, Ali Baba is often filled to 
capacity.
The dcor is sparse, but draped fabric and plants hang from 
the ceiling, giving the restaurant an airy feel. The tables are 
small, and once the food starts coming, it feels almost as 
though there isnt enough room for everything youve ordered.
Each meal comes with a plate of rice mixed with pignoli nuts 
and a small house salad tossed in the only dressing available, 
made of a mixture of lemon, oil, and herbs. Every table also 
gets a basket of warm pita bread, which is put to excellent 
use with Ali Babas array of appetizers.
The grape leaves, filled either with rice and lamb or a 
vegetarian filling consisting mostly of flavored rice, provide 
a light start to the meal. They come in two sizes, and are 
moderately priced at around $4 per order. Another appetizer 
worth trying is the hummus. The balance of seasonings and 
flavors is just right, and the top of each order is decorated 
with a puddle of oil filled with spices, making for the best 
hummus Ive found yet.
The appetizers at Ali Baba are significantly better than the 
entres. The shish tawook (skewered chargrilled chicken) is 
served off of the skewer and often tastes burnt. A piece of 
green pepper accompanies it but doesnt provide any great 
flavor to the meal. The only part of this dish that stands out 
from other dry chicken dishes is the optional lemon garlic 
sauce that tastes suspiciously like the salad dressing.
The couscous dish, served with either a lamb or vegetarian 
stew, contains interesting flavors, but the couscous is dry and 
often difficult to eat. Despite having couscous, the dish still 
comes with the rice, which provides for too many dry side 
dishes for one entre.
Meals are reasonably priced, and despite the lack of satisfying 
entres, the appetizers alone are worth the visit. Dishes like 
the Vegetarian Special at dinner and the Healthy Variety at 
lunch include a small selection of appetizers for a price similar 
to that of a single appetizer (around $5 to $6).
Make it at home
Dont care to eat out for your Middle Eastern and 
Mediterranean cravings? Try making these dishes at home for 
an alternative to dining out.
Hummus
1 can chickpeas/garbanzo beans 
Vi cup olive oil
2 tablespoons lemon juice
2 cloves garlic, crushed or chopped 
1 y2 tablespoon tahini 
(optional) Vi teaspoon salt
Combine all ingredients in a food processor, blending until 
smooth. Serve hummus with olive oil on top. Keep up to three 
days in the refrigerator.
Couscous
1 box plain couscous 
1 tablespoon butter 
% teaspoon salt
Follow instructions on box to make couscous. After it cooks, 
fluff with a fork. Mix in butter and salt until butter melts.
Serve as a side dish or main course. To make this recipe more 
unique, add your favorite herbs and spices when adding the 
butter. Can also be served cold as a salad with tomatoes and 
cucumbers.
Mediterranean Pita Sandwich
1 piece pita
2 tablespoon hummus
1 cooked chicken breast, sliced 
6 artichoke heart quarters, chopped 
1 roasted red pepper
Spread hummus onto pita. Place red pepper, chicken, and 
artichoke hearts on top and roll or fold in half. This can be 
made with homemade or store-bought hummus. Like spicy 
foods? Try using chili-pepper-flavored hummus instead of 
plain to get an extra punch of flavor.
