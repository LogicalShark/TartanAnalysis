SECOND ANNUAL INTER
SCHOLASTIC MEET.
Dual Meet C. I. T. vs. Westminster.
C. I. T. and Pittsburgh High School 
Win Easy Victory.
Last Saturday the Second Annual 
Interscholastic Track and Field Meet 
was held in conjunction with a dual 
meet, C. I. T. vs. Westminster, main
ly for the purpose of acquainting the 
High School men with our institu
tion. The weather was warm and 
the field dry, and all contestants were 
in excellent spirits. The band of the 
Fourteenth Regiment N. G. P. was 
in attendance and gave selections at 
frequent intervals. The official an
nouncer this time enjoyed the com
fort of a table and chair, which he had 
been badly in need of for a long time. 
Every possible effort was made to 
give the guests as brilliant a recep
tion as possible, and a considerable 
amount of money was spent for that 
purpose. The attendance, especially 
later in the afternoon, was up to the 
standard.
The High Schools and Prep. Schools 
entered were: Pittsburgh High
School, Wilkinsburg High School, 
Greensburg High School, Allegheny 
High School, Peabody High School, 
New Brighton High School, East 
Liberty Academy, Shady Side Acad
emy, Sewickley High School, Haw
ley Prep. School.
Pittsburgh High School won the 
meet, and with less effort than last 
year. One of its best men, Thomas, 
won the mile and half mile runs, and 
in both made better time than any 
of the college entries. However, the 
difference being only 3^ seconds in 
the mile run, it is probable that Wait 
could have done better if he had been 
pushed harder. Another promising 
Pittsburgh High man is Gass, who 
won both the discus throw and the 
high hurdles. Sheehan, an E. L. A. 
man, broke the Local Interscholastic 
Record by jumping 5 feet 9 inches 
in the high jump. He also won the 
broad jump and the 100-yard dash, 
beating Coulter of Westminster, the 
winner of the College broad jump, by 
11^4 inches. Sheehan also is the win
ner of the highest number of indi
vidual points (IS), for which a ban
ner was awarded. The final score 
for the interscholastic meet is:
Pittsburgh High ..............................39
East Liberty Academy......................25
Wilkinsburg High ............................17

Our athletes had little difficulty in 
beating those of Westminster Col
lege, although, according to individ
ual points, Wesminster possesses the 
best all-round men. Ward and Ash
ton, of Westminster, won 16 and 15 
points, respectively, while Hosey, our 
best, made 13. Two out of 15 college 
events were not run. The pole vault 
was cancelled, because Westminsters 
best man had to play second base, 
while the mile relay was conceded to 
Carnegie, thus giving us 5 points 
against Westminter 3. In this dual 
meet only two places counted, and 
no trial heats were run. The final 
score was:
C. I. T. . 67
Westminster ........................45
Hammer, Discus, and Shot Put 
were all won by Ashton (W), who 
thus became the star of the field 
events. Of our athletes only Clair 
was able to secure second place. The 
result follows:
Hammer1, Ashton, 127.15 ft. 2,
Clair.
Discus1, Ashton, 116.15 ft. 2, Par

There were altogether too many 
people on the field that had no busi
ness there, and consequently the view 
from the grandstand was at times 
greatly obstructed. Besides, the 
judges and other officials, inspectors, 
contestants and press representatives, 
several superfluous men were much 
in evidence, making all-important ges
tures, inconveniencing officials, and 
being of no use whatever. It is hoped 
that in the future adequate measures 
will be taken to prevent such individ
uals from infesting the field.
TENNIS ASSOCIATION FORMED
At a meeting held last Monday, a 
tennis association was formed and 
the following officers elected:
Pres., E. E. Duff, Vice Pres., O. D. 
Beeken, Jr., Sec.-Treas., G. M. Douthett, Committee on Constitution, 
Douthett, Beeken.
A good crowd was in attendance, 
showing that the fellows are taking 
great interest in this sport. Man
ager Flood outlined his plans for the 
season. The main change was that 
the captain uses his discretion in pick
ing his team instead of holding a 
tournament as before. Everything 
points to a very successful season.
HAMILTON HITS HOMER.
Westminster Beaten in the Ninth.
The Varsity won their fourth con
secutive game by defeating Westmin
ster last Saturday by a score of 7 
to 5.
Carts had an off day, striking out 
only ten men and giving one man a 
walk. Outside of that, he pitched a 
good game. Phythyon was easily lo
cated; 13 hits being made from his 
deliveries, one of which went for four 
bases, while two more were good for 
triples.
Capt. Vail and Wehr also were 
feeling badly, as the best they could 
do at the bat was hit two singles and 
a triple each. De Muth walked up 
to the plate three times, ambled once 
and hit two singles, which boosted 
his batting average some.
No score was made until the third 
then Carts reached first on Lists 
fumble. Mcllvains high foul was 
gathered in by Mansell. Vail hit to 
middle where Jamison let the ball 
get away. De Muth bunted safely 
and arrived at second when Carts 
was caught at the plate, Mansell to 
Phythyon. Wehr lifted one over sec
ond and reached that station when 
Logan failed to prevent Vail from 
scoring. Hall made the third out on 
a fly to List.
In the fifth, after Carts and Mcllvaine had retired, we again scored 
two runs on a triple by Vail, a single 
by De Muth, and a triple by Wehr.
In their half of the same inning, 
Westminster scored their first run 
on a single by Logan, a sacrifice by 
Mansell, and a double by Parrish.
Two more runs in the seventh and 
two in the eighth tied the score, as
our team had annexed a run in the 
sixth. Westminster retired in their 
alf of the ninth without scoring. 
Cramer, first up for our boys, fanned. 
Then Vail hit a single to right mid
dle. Hamilton, next up, drove a ter
rific hit over the third basemans head, 
just out of the reach of the left field
er, and made the round of the bases 
before the ball was returned to the 
infield. And the game broke up.
Phythyon fielded well from the 
mound, taking care of three putouts and six assists. Parrish was 
capable at first base.

CO-OPERATION.
Last Saturday the Athletic Asso
ciation held its annual invitation 
track meet, to which came representa
tives from a majority of the high and 
prep schools of this section of the 
country. In addition to that our own 
track team had a dual meet with 
Westminster and our baseball nine 
played a very exciting game with the 
team from Westminster. All of this 
happened on one afternoon and the 
student tickets were good for admis
sion. Despite the attractions offered, 
an exceedingly poor crowd turned 
out. A crowd which was a crying 
shame. The bleachers were not even 
comfortably filled. The occasion mer
ited more than this. The games are
not played for the sole benefit of the 
men performing, but for the benefit 
of the entire student-body. The two 
teams did their part by winning. The 
students did NOT do their part by 
turning out. In addition to the mat
ter of supporting our own teams, we 
should have seen to it that those 
teams we invited to our field had an 
audience of a respectable size. It 
was to our own selfish interests, in a 
way, to see that such was the case. 
We failed to co-operate. The ath
letic authorities and the student-body 
did not pull together.
The Tartan has for the past two 
weeks been urging the members of 
the student-body to each write a per
sonal letter to the Pittsburgh Coun
cil and urge upon them the passing 
of the ordinance making th*e Morewood avenue approach a realty. How 
many have done this? Not very 
many, and yet there is not a single 
student who does not know the value 
and desirability of this feature. They 
would like to have the new entrance 
cut through. They would like to en
joy the new athletic field a year or 
so sooner than they now can. And 
yet they wont write a simple little 
letter to the Councils and tell them 
so. They refuse to turn a hand for 
their own individual benefits. And 
why? Because they lack the spirit 
and co-operation.
This institution has grown with al
most unparalleled rapidity and has 
reached that stage at which this rate 
cf growth can not longer be contin
ued except through the co-operation 
of ALL its members. The sooner 
and the more completely this co-operation comes, the more rapidly and 
perfectly will the Carnegie Institute 
of Technology come into its own. Not 
that it wont get there without more 
co-operation than we now have, but 
the quicker will it reach its com
pleter development. And so The 
Tartan appeals to every true Car
negie man to assist in the work. Not 
much will be required of the indi
vidual in order that much may be 
done by the institution. Do your 
share willingly, with a whole heart, 
and do it to the best of your ability 
and we shall soon see the fruits of 
the seed we have planted.
If YOU wont write a Personal Letter, fill out this form completely 
and mail it. DO IT NOW.
To the Pittsburgh Councils,
City Hall, Pittsburgh, Pa.
The Honorable, Members of the Pittsburgh Council:
As a student in the Carnegie Institute of Technology I earnestly desire

THE TARTAN3
PITT SHUT OUT.
Given No Chance by Carts.
The Varsity nine gave an exhibi
tion of what a hard-hitting team be
hind a good pitcher can do when they 
walloped Pitt on Wednesday, May 1, 
by a score of 6 to 0.
Carts was easily the hero of the 
game, striking out twelve men, with
out allowing a single hit. He issued 
two passes and hit a third man, while 
the only other one of his opponents 
to reach first did so when Gearhart 
fumbled an easy rap toward second. 
Carts was also given six fielding 
chances and handled them perfectly. 
The others of the team were very 
much on the job, but the infield took 
care of all of the fielding, and the 
game was always safe. Hall 
was especially commendable, his four 
assists being difficult and requiring 
speed and coolness.
Our men hit almost at will, but 
were careless on the bases, but for 
which the score would have been 
much larger. A number were caught 
napping off the bases or were thrown 
out on attempted steals. While some 
of the credit is due to Pitts fast 
throwing, the fault was also with our 
players.
Wehr was the leader of the battsmen with a batting average of 1.000 
for the game. In four times up he 
hit one double, two singles, and drew 
a pass. Hall also had three hits, two 
of which brought in runs, helping to 
boost the score some.
The trouble started in the first in
ning, when Cooper mistook the pad
ding on Mcllvaines pants for the 
plate and delivered the ball to that 
spot, which naturally let Mac amble 
to first. Capt. Vail laid a pretty sin
gle out in right. De Muth bunted 
sacrificially, Cooper to Quailey. Wehr 
hit to right center, and Mcllvaine tal
lied. Hall hit a long one to left, and 
Vail scored, Wehr following suit. 
Hall went to third on a passed ball 
by Allen, and scored when Gearhart 
sacrificed, Graves to Quailey. Moor
head ended the session by striking 
out, but four runs had been scored.
Cooper was removed in the third 
inning after he walked two men, and 
Over took his place. He also was 
reached often for safeties, but re
ceived excellent backing. Graves, at 
shortstop, was a marvel of quickness 
and helped Quailey down quite a few 
of our men before they reached first.

j WHATS WHAT AND HOW. |
But a few weeks and the gate of 
this educational corral will be thrown 
open and a fractious bunch of young 
and tender engineers, reeking with 
assorted information, dropsical with 
the wisdom of twenty-one and paw
ing with eagerness to be at em, will 
be turned loose on a waiting world.
Yrersed in the subtle diplomacy of 
college politics; animated encyclo
paedias of human frailties as mani
fested by their instructors, with reci
pes for making the most of them, the 
earth looks like easy meat.
It is a real shame to take the thou
sand or so per month, that a seething 
mob of employers will step on each 
other for a chance to offer.
Four years of solicitude over a per
verse and frivolous Faculty, consumed 
by a dubious curiosity, as to their 
knowledge of a variety of facts that 
are not eligible to good society, and 
whose origin is obscure to say the 
least, have developed an imposing ma
turity.
There remain only the assorted 
frenzies of commencement week be
fore the industrial salvation of the 
woild. It will perhaps be remember
ed by those whose familiarity with 
religious matters is not too casual, 
that creation is said to have been ac
complished in a week. That is prob
ably the only point of resemblance 
between the educational convulsion 
known as commencement and the con
struction of this terrestrial residence 
for the Anglo-Saxon race and its game 
of baseball. But it is an instructive 
clinic for human weaknesses and a 
sort of clearing house for undergrad
uate experiences combined.
Safe over the border and no extra
dition treat}" in operation, the es
caped graduates patronizingly pre
sent the dehorned and partially hyp
notized Faculty with a whole bunch 
of keys to various mysteries that 
prowled along the educational right 
of way for four years.
It is a poor class indeed, that has 
not added at least one method to the 
thousand or so already extant for 
hoodwinking the ingenuous instruc
tor, and for trying out the elastic 
limit of his patience.
The accurate and comprehensive 
knowledge of each other's rear sitting 
rooms and the unreserved generosity 
with this knowledge make of com
mencement exercises charming stud
ies of souls in the nude.
The audience is treated to artistic 
dissections of each others personali
ties with a sublime carelessness in 
leaving the pieces lie about, where 
they may be inspected at leisure.
Breezy comment upon physical ex
teriors and interiors for that matter; 
discussion of the rumor that one 
uses a happily located wart for a col
lar button or mysterious references 
to celluloid socks.
Betrayal of secret practice with an 
unexperienced mustache and the de
scent into final despair of sideburns, 
with the obvious conclusion that it 
is easier to raise a P. to a C. or
even to raise H----- than to prema
turely raise this badge of manhood.
It may be the graduates sole ap
pearance upon a public platform, but 
it shall not be without its eclat. Later 
he will be occupied with the serious 
business of selecting a mother-in-law 
and incidentally of securing a glitter
ing position wherewith to cajole this 
formidable acquisition and will, they 
say, shortly reach the conclusion that 
it is far easier to lose the one than 
the other, but now he is concerned 
with the verbal drainage of his in
tellect that is inundated with a freshet 
of words.
He is frantic with the idea that he 
alone knows that beyond the Alps 
lies fair Italy, and must get it off his 
chest at the earliest moment. It is 
a glorious experience and alas it 
comes but once.
PRES. MOFFETT SPEAKS.
Dr. Moffett, President of Washing
ton and Jefferson College, delivered 
his postponed address to the students 
of the Science School last Thursday 
morning at the usual lecture hour. 
Dr. Moffett made a hit with the 
boys in spite of the fact that he made 
no mention of the recent victory of 
our baseball team at Washington.
The subject of the lecture was 
Some Factors that Make for Suc
cess, and Dr. Moffett brought out 
many interesting points along this 
line, showing how many men of to
day have attained success in ways en
tirely foreign to their expectations 
and their early desires. He said that 
the best definition of success that he 
had ever heard was Longfellows, 
when the latter said, Success is do
ing wrell what you have to do. Dr. 
Mocett gave us some terse and timeMws suggestions, such as: Have some
aim; dont drift, although luck may 
come to a drifter; Dont set too 
definite an aim, for many attain suc
cess in other than their chosen lines; 
Dont hope for promotion except on 
a basis of having done your work so 
well that it is necessary for the busi
ness that you be promoted; Save 
a little money out of your salary; 
Finish each days work that day.
Dr. Moffets talk, while some
what abstract, was sincere and full 
of interest, and, since we have no 
Prexie of our own, we are glad to 
hear from those of other schools 
whenever opportunity will permit.
CHANGES MADE BY THE
BOARD OF CONTROL.
At the regular May meeting of the 
Board of Control of the Athletic As
sociation, which was held on Wednes

lowing members of the Varsity basket-ball team: W. R. Williams (Capt.)

CARNEGIE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY : : :
T
HE Carnegie Institute of Technology consists of four 
separate schools, each with its own faculty, buildings 
and student body. The courses of instruction 
offered in these four schools differ widely.
School of Applied ScienceOffers courses in chemical, 
civil, electrical, commercial, mechanical, metallurgical, 
mining and sanitary engineering.
School of Applied DesignOffers courses in architecture, 
interior decoration, illustration and painting, open to both 
men and women.
School of Applied IndustriesOffers industrial courses in 
machine construction, building construction, and elec
trical equipment and installation. Short courses are offered 
in the various trades for applicants with experience. A 
new course to equip men as teachers in manual training 
and in trade school work is also offered. The increasing 
demand for such men provides an attractive field for the 
progressive young mechanic and the public school teacher
Margaret Morrison Carnegie SchoolFor women only. 
Offers courses in household economics, secretarial work, 
dressmaking, and costume illustration and design. Be
cause of the demand for trained teachers, graduate courses 
are offered for those who wish to prepare for the many 
positions now open for women in these newer lines of work.
Night CoursesThe four schools offer night courses in 
practically all of the above subjects to provide educational 
opportunities for those who are at work during the day.
