Senate attacks ROTC discrimination policy
By MATT BUSHEY
Tartan Staffwriter
The CMU Student Senate 
adopted a resolution which at
tacks the policy of discrimina
tion within ROTC on the basis of 
sexual orientation. The resolu
tion, passed at last Tuesdays 
meeting, ultimately states that 
if ROTC does not end its dis
crimination policy, the Univer
sity is to rid the campus of all 
ROTC programs by the 1995- 
1996 academic year.
The resolution was drafted by
Christopher Wood, a junior psy
chology major and member of 
cmuOUT. Wood, along with Erik 
Altmann, chair of the Student 
Senate Campus Affairs Commit
tee, and Mike Tomblyn, chair of 
the Academic Affairs Commit
tee, approached the Student 
Senate with the resolution.
The resolution reads, 
Whereas, Carnegie Mellon 
Universitys Statement of As
surance states Carnegie Mellon 
University does not discriminate 
in admission, employment, or 
administration of its programs
on the basis of... sexual orien
tation; and whereas, ROTC, in
cluding Army ROTC, NROTC, 
and AFROTC, is directed by 
Department of Defense policy 
which prohibits gays, lesbians, 
and bisexuals from service. 
The resolution goes on to state, 
It is hypocritical of the Univer
sity to allow ROTC to discrimi
nate. The Senate officially con
demns CMU through the reso
lution and calls on the Univer
sity to state in all publications 
that the University allows ROTC 
to remain in direct violation of
itsStatementofAssurance.The 
Senate also directs the Univer
sity to replace all of the financial 
aid that a student loses by being 
dismissed from ROTC due to his 
or her sexual orientation.
The Senate has resolved that 
they [will] prohibit ROTC or 
ROTC-sponsored organizations 
[from participating] in events 
funded or partially funded by 
the Student Activities Fee. This 
includes events such as Spring 
Carnival.
The Senate then directed the 
University to take measures
against ROTC. The Senate called 
on Carnegie Mellon to prohibit 
the use of University facilities, 
finances, and resources by ROTC 
and ROTC-related organiza
tions. Do not agree to any new or 
extend prior contracts with pro
grams of the Department of De
fense or its branches or any other 
organization which requires 
Carnegie Mellon to discriminate 
on the basis of sexual orienta
tion.
Most importantly, the Student 
Senate resolution states, Be it 
finally resolved that if discrimi
nation on the basis of sexual 
orientation by ROTC is not 
ended, the University is directed 
to terminate any and all con
tracts with ROTC programs by 
the end of the 1995-1996 aca
demic year, until those programs 
no longer discriminate on the 
basis of sexual orientation. 
According to Altmann, the 
1996 deadline gives time for all 
of the ROTC students on cam
pus now to graduate. Its the 
Universitys responsibility to 
find alternate programs that

Beaux Arts Ball returns in 1992
The four demonstrators arrested for 
protesting in front of the Software En
gineering Institute this summer were 
found guilty on Friday at their trial in 
Pittsburgh City Court. The arrested 
were charged with defiant trespass.
Security Director James LaPaglia 
said, Defiant trespassing is a sum
mary offense, which is the lowest grade 
of crime. It is the same as disorderly 
conduct. There is no criminal record 
involved, and the sentencing is either 
90 days in jail or a maximum fine of 
$300.
Cassi Geier, a University of Pitts
burgh tranfer student, Erin Bush, an
other University of Pittsburgh student, 
Michelle Wadium, and Bill Frizlin were 
found guilty of defiant trespass. Al
though they were charged $300 plus 
costs, the judge suspended the fine. 
Nevertheless, the summary offense will 
still be transcribed on their records, 
and the Software Engineering Insti
tute projected research continued.
Software Engineering Institute re
ceives funds from the Department of 
Defense and is heavily involved with 
the advancement of numerous research 
projects. It was because of the Soft
ware Engineering Institutes research 
with the defense department that the 
demonstrators chose to protest and 
were later arrested on campus.
The people arrested were represen
tatives of the Pittsburgh Students for 
Peace organization while protesting on 
Nagasaki Day. The organization is pri
marily comprised of college students 
from Carnegie Mellon University and 
the University of Pittsburgh, although 
membership is open to all area stu
dents and non-students. The organiza
tion is concerned with the Department 
of Defense contracts on local campuses 
and also works to raise money for their 
Fund for Humanity.
A Pittsburgh Students for Peace 
member and protestor who was con
victed, Cassi Geier, said, I certainly 
hope this will bring to light some of the 
atrocities in the Software Institute  
atrocities such as the war research and 
weapons production research.

The Beaux Arts Ball is slated 
to return next semester. It is 
tentatively scheduled for Feb
ruary 29. This CFA tradition is 
a masquerade ball that encom
passes all of the College of Fine 
Arts and lasts until a daybreak 
breakfast buffet.
The ball is run entirely by CFA 
students. PR Manager Lizzie 
Mogel said that the goal of the 
ball is to have as many strange 
things as we can come up with. 
Past strange things included 
everything from bands (from 
CMU Gospel Choir to the Vol
cano Suns) to strolling magi
cians.
The tradition of the Ball goes 
back to 1924, when the first ball, 
Festival of Lanterns, occured. 
Balls always have a theme, rang
ing anywhere from 1933s
Evening on Mars to 1985s 
Black and White Ball.
The committee is considering 
three themes for the 1992 Ball: 
Fools Ball, Garden of Earthly 
Desires, and Environment, 
Progress, and Science.
Balls attract an average of 
1200-1400 people, who occupy 
all of CFA. The 1990 Ball fea
tured two bands and many per
formers who occupied class
rooms, stu
dios, and mez
zanines.
Part of the 
proceeds of 
the Ball go to 
charity  in 
1990, the re
cipient was 
Whales Tales, an organization 
that helps with family crises, 
drug and alcohol abuse, run
aways, and abused youth.
Said Mogel of the event, Its 
like Halloween, except in Feb
ruary.

Senate calls for more, better bike racks
By MIKE KUNSMANN
Tartan Staffwriter
Student Senate unanimously passed 
the bike report at last Tuesdays meet
ing. According to the report, the num
ber of bicycle riders on campus has 
greatly increased in the past few years, 
and although some effort has beenmade 
to increase the quality and the quantity 
of the bike racks, these improvements 
have barely made a dent in the problem 
of bicycle parking space on campus.
Since there are not enough facilities 
to accomodate all the bikes, students 
have adapted by taking their bikes into 
classrooms and finding space in their 
dorm rooms.
Jim Albert, a Senator who worked on 
the bike report and a sophomore archi
tecture major, said that the problem is 
getting out of hand. The overcrowded 
racks can potentially lead to damaged
bikes, including scratched frames and 
punctured tires. Because bike owners 
would like to keep their bikes in good 
condition, they find more favorable 
parking spaces for their bikes. With 
increasing frequency, students are
parking their bikes against trees and 
lamposts, blocking access to handicap 
ramps.
The proposal argues that bike riding 
should be encouraged, but the lack of
parking and the unfavorable conditions 
of the existing bike racks are discour
aging it.
The report also states that many of 
the current bike racks are not an ad
equate style.
Based on 
collected 
data, Albert 
and Tony Deross, a Sen
ator who 
helped com
pile the re
port and a 
sophomore 
biology ma
jor, proposed 
certain improvements. These include 
adding new racks under Hamerschlag, 
on the store side of the Margaret 
Morrison Apartment building, and at 
Wean Hall, at Scaife Hall, at College of
Fine Arts, and at Baker Hall, and com
pletely replacing and increasing the 
number of bike racks at Morewood Gar
dens and Doherty Hall.
The proposal states that these are 
only the most urgent problems. A sur
vey will be conducted next semester to 
find out in more detail what other im
provements the bicycle-riding students 
need.
[The survey] will come out next se
mester, said Albert. The survey will 
also help find out what kinds of racks 
are best for the different areas and how 
many facilities are needed.
Wed like to get a picture before we 
spend, said Erik Altman, chairofCampus Affairs Committee. He also said 
that Dean of Student Affairs Michael 
Murphy has given $5,000 for the new 
racks. According to Albert, Murphy and 
Foster are both very enthusiastic about 
[the project].
[The survey] will come out next 
semester.

PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 6, (AP)  
Appointed Sen. Harris Wofford won 
a dramatic come-from-behind vic
tory Tuesday over former Attorney 
General Dick Thornburgh to become 
the first Pennsylvania Democrat 
elected to the U.S. Senate since 
1962.
With 67 percent of the 9,428 pre
cincts reporting, Wofford led with 
1,175,361, or 58 percent, to 
Thornburghs 853,757 votes, or 42 
percent.
A number of GOP areas still had 
not reported.
But Wofford, who once trailed by 
as much as 40 points in pre-election
polls, guaranteed his victory by run
ning surprisingly well in tradition
ally Republican areas.
I think I was just lucky to be the 
messenger of a message that was 
there, Wofford said in a telephone 
interview from his hotel room.
People want action from Wash
ington to help working families. 
This was time for action. I want to 
go down as an agent of action and 
change.
Gov. Robert P. Casey, who ap
pointed Wofford interim Senator 
earlier this year, said Woffords per
formance was a victory for his 
message.
We need national health care in 
this country, tax breaks for middleincome people of this country that 
have been victimized by 10 years of 
Reagan-Bush.
The contest pitted a former Bush 
administration cabinet member, the 
Republican Thornburgh, against 
the lesser known Wofford.
Thornburgh, addressing support
ers in Pittsburgh shortly before 
midnight, said he suffered a rever
sal but not defeat.
Defeat can only come in the soul 
and my souls alive and kicking to
night, he said.
He said the results showed that
people are concerned about the 
economy, health care and other 
quality-of-life issues.
Senator Wofford did a superior 
job of communicating his concerns 
to the people of Pennsylvania and I 
extended my congratulations to him 
on that, and I wish him well, he 
said.
Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.) said 
the election would send a very 
strong message to the White 
House. There are many, many do
mestic issues that have to be faced. 
I think this tells [President Bush] 
what a very major state is think
ing.
Thornburgh, governor from 1979 
to 1987, cast his ballot in Pittsburgh.
Wofford, interim Senator since 
May, voted near his home in Bryn 
Mawr, a Philadelphia suburb.
Wofford had been given little 
chance at the outset.
But his campaign climbed steadily 
in public opinion polls as he coupled 
a call for national health care with 
an appeal to middle-class voters.
As winner of the special election, 
he will serve the remaining three 
years of the term of Republican John 
Heinz, who died in an April plane 
crash.
Elections warn Bush for 92 race
WASHINGTON, Nov. 7, (DJ)
 The voters had a message for 
President Bush, and it came in a 
shout, not a whisper: Ignore us 
at your peril.
The surprising victory of 
Democrat Harris Wofford in the 
Pennsylvania Senate race over 
Dick Thornburgh, a former gov
ernor and member of the Reagan 
and Bush cabinets, sent Bush 
an unmistakable signal: Hed 
better produce a health-care plan 
and do whatever it takes, in
cluding cutting taxes for the 
middle class, to get the economy 
out of the doldrums.
Suddenly uneasy about the 
1992 election, Bush  who left 
for Rome, an irony that didnt go 
unnoticed in the political rubble 
herehas ordered his top-level
aides to develop antidotes to the 
two issues that transformed 
Wofford from an innocuous in
tellectual into a potent populist.
The administration, which for 
months resisted action on health 
care, now is likely to propose 
the outlines of a comprehensive 
health-insurance plan of its own, 
vastly increasing the chances of 
major changes in the system. 
Bush, who acknowledged Tues
day that he was depressed 
about Thornburghs defeat, is 
expected to try to counter 
Democratic calls for sweep
ing national health insurance 
with a more market-oriented 
proposal.
His aim would be to generate 
more competition among health
care providers while guaranteeing
health coverage for uninsured 
Americans.
The American people are de
manding action, the President 
said, before leaving for Italy.
The result is a huge boost in 
the prospects for a tax cut, prob
ably early next year.
The White House is toying 
with tax incentives for savings 
and for first-time home buying, 
and a one-time break for the 
middle class.
Bush understands the politi
cal climate has changed. Even 
as the votes were being counted 
in Pennsylvania, he postponed a 
10-day trip to Asia he was sched
uled to take late this month. 
Instead, hell concentrate on the 
domestic issues his critics argue 
he has ignored.
Across the country, voters ex
pressed impatience, frustration 
and anger.
While it was a sobering day for 
the President, the Democrats 
didnt savor it either. A Republi
can was elected governor of Mis
sissippi for the first time since 
Reconstruction. And Republi
cans, riding a wave of anger 
about Democratic tax increases, 
swept into control of both houses 
of the New Jersey Legislature.
The sentiments of New Jersey 
voters were much the same as 
those of their neighbors in Penn
sylvania.
In New Jersey, as in Pennsyl
vania, voters were expressing 
resentment with a political es
tablishment that seemed deaf to 
their concerns.
House passes abortion counseling bill
WASHINGTON, Nov. 7, (DJ)
 The House voted to allow fed
erally financed health clinics to 
counsel pregnant women about 
Abortion, but the margin wasnt 
large enough to override Presi
dent Bushs expected veto.
But abortion-rights advocates 
havent given up hope; the House 
mightvoteonafree-standingversion of the measure within the 
next few weeks, and the propo
nents hope to get a veto-proof 
majority then.
In the meantime, abortionrights advocates were disap
pointed about the vote. It looks 
like we cant override this, ad
mitted Rep. Pat Schroeder (D.,
Colo. ), who fought to overturn the 
so-called gag rule. Its a very sad 
day.
Although the legislation con
tains many other provisions, the 
provision would delay implemen
tation of a Bush administration 
regulation that prohibits the 
4,000 family planning clinics 
which get federal funds from tell
ing their patients about abortion 
and from referring them to physi
cians who perform abortions.
Advocates argued that it would 
be wrong for the government to 
withhold information on health 
options  especially from poor 
women, who account for most of 
the clinics clientele. For the govemment not to tell the truth and 
the whole truth is not the way we 
workinAmerica, saidRep. John 
Edward Porter (R., 111.).
Supporters of the provision ar
gued that the issue wasnt abor
tion, but rather the ability of 
people in need of medical care to 
find out how best they can be 
cured. This is an important vote 
for freedom and for health care, 
said Rep. Barbara Boxer (D., Ca
lif.).
Opponents of the provision 
painted the question as almost 
wholly as a matter of whether the 
federal government should con
done abortion. Abortion is not a 
legitimate method offamily plan
ning, said Rep. Hemy Hyde (R., 
111.). He said the provision would 
steer pregnant women to abor
tion mills.
This amendment, Rep. Chris
topher Smith (R., N.J.) stated 
flatly, is about the promotion of 
abortion.
Opponents of the provision ex
pressed hope that the larger bill 
could be passed without the gagrule language prior to the end of 
this years legislative session.
Before thebill goes to the White 
House .itstillmustbe voted on by 
the Senate, and some remaining 
differences between the House 
version and an earlier Senate 
version must be resolved.
Bush bashes Duke
WASHINGTON, Nov. 6, 
(AP)  President Bush de
nounced Republican David 
Duke, the former Ku Klnx 
Klan leader running for gov
ernor of Louisiana, as an in
sincere charlatan and said 
he would vote for Democrat 
Edwin Edwards if he had to 
choose between the two.
Bushinsistedhewasnottrying to tell the voters of Louisi
ana how to cast their ballots 
next week.... Theyve got to 
make their own decisions.
But asked what he would 
do if he lived in Louisiana, 
Bush said he would end up 
voting for Edwards, the 
former three-term governor 
whom Duke is facing in the 
November 16 runoff. Whats 
the choice, man? Bush asked.
And when someone has so 
recently endorsed Naziism, it 
is inconceivable that such a 
person can legitimately as
pire to... a leadership role in a 
free society, he said.
And when someone has a 
long record, an ugly record of 
racism and of bigotry, that 
recordsimply cannot be erased 
by the glib rhetoric of a politi
cal campaign, he said.
So I believe that David 
Duke is an insincere charla
tan. I believe hes attempting 
to hoodwink the voters ofLouisiana. And I believe that he 
should be rejected for what he 
is and what he stands for, 
said Bush.
The president said he had 
hesitated to speak out so 
strongly against Duke because 
he did not want in all of this 
inadvertently to help the guy.
But I think more impor
tant than that is that I be 
positioned clearly and defini
tively against racism and 
against hatred and against 
bigotry.
Term limits fail to pass
SEATTLE, Nov. 6, (AP)  
Washington state voters dealt a 
setback to the national drive to 
limit politicians terms, heeding 
the pleas of their most powerful 
incumbent, House SpeakerThomas S. Foley.
Defying forecasts that showed 
support for term limits running 
at 60 percent or more, voters 
decisively defeated what would 
have been the nations toughest 
term limit law, 54 percent to 46 
percent.
The Washington measure 
would have restricted state leg
islators to 10 years total service 
and members of the congres
sional delegation to 12, includ
ing no more than three two-year 
terms in the stateorU.S. houses.

Tartan Sports Editor
As fall buggy rolls ended this 
weekend, most people involved 
in Sweepstakes were optimistic 
about the spring season.
There were a lot of organiza
tions out, which is kind of un
usual for the fall, said Assis
tant Sweepstakes Chair Joanne 
Nicklas, a senior CFA major. 
There are a number of drivers 
who have already qualified for 
race day [a minimum of 10 prac
tice rolls-is required for a driver 
to roll on race day]. Considering 
that last year was the first 
Sweepstakes Matt [Adler], 
Alexis [dePlanque], and I were 
involved in, things have gone 
extraordinarily well.
It was a really good fall sea
son, said SDCs John Lakin, a 
senior physics major. We got a 
lot of people out, except for the 
days when it was really cold.
One of the big concerns this 
year has been safety; the Safety 
Committee has been busy over
hauling the safety rules, to 
eliminate ambiguity, accord
ing to Nicklas. We needed to 
make sure the guidelines are 
understood, she said.
The new safety regulations 
have impacted some organiza
tions more than others. According to Lakin, SDC had to re
vamp one of its buggies to meet 
regulations. The regulations are 
definitely stricter, but I dont 
really know if other organiza
tions are following through. I 
just know we are, he said.
Complaints have surfaced 
dealing with poor flagging, but 
Sweepstakes Chair dePlanque, 
a senior information systems 
major, says that the situation is 
being resolved.
Early on, a lot of flaggers on 
the back hills didnt see cars on 
those hills as being their respon
sibility, she said. Its very hard 
to police, but weve been crack
ing down and the problem is 
getting better.
Theres always trouble keep
ing people off the course, said 
Lakin. I know of at least three 
recent instances where there 
have been people on the course, 
but overall, I think the Sweep
stakes Committee has been do
ing a good job.
As to the future, todays 
Sweepstakes meeting will de
termine the agenda for the upcomingmonths. Alotofits open 
for discussion, said dePlanque, 
but we hope to be active again 
not long after the end of Janu
ary.

Student Senate demands ROTC policy change
TheCM from page 1
don't discriminate, said Altjnann-Wood served in the military 
for two years and does not see 
[he resolution as anti-ROTC, but 
rather as anti-discrimination. 
There is no option other than to 
threaten to remove ROTC if they 
donotchange,saidWood. How
ever, he feels that the Univer
sity is not going to take a sudden 
and direct action against ROTC. 
I think ultimately the faculty 
orthe board of trustees will have 
to put pressure on the adminis
tration to change, he said.
Other schools have already 
implemented a policy against 
their ROTC programs. Harvard 
and Yale have refused to rein
state ROTC programs and MIT 
plans to get rid of ROTC by 1998 
(there is no change in its policy. 
Some schools have removed aca
demic credit for ROTC classes.
The incident from which the 
resolution originated was that a 
CMU student was forced to 
disenroll from the Navy ROTC 
because he is gay. As reported in 
the October issue of Focus, the 
student received a letter from 
Capt. Joseph Mazza, command
ing officer of the universitys 
NROTC unit, that in part read, 
You have been placed on in
terim leave of absence (ILOA) as 
a result of your admitted homo
sexuality. During your ILOA, 
your scholarship is suspended
In order to resolve this issue, 
you must schedule an appoint
ment with a staff psychiatrist at 
the Western Psychiatric Insti
tute and Clinic or other suitable 
facility to obtain an analysis of 
your sexual orientation.

According to Mazza, the policy 
of discrimination against gays, 
lesbians, and bisexuals starts 
and ends in Washington. If the 
University feels NROTC dis
criminates, they should fight it 
at the [Department of Defense] 
level, said Mazza.
Mazza refused to comment on 
the Department of Defense 
policy on homosexuality because 
he feels he has no control over its 
change or implementation.
According to the policy, Ho
mosexuality is incompatible 
with military service.... The pre
sence of suchmembers adversely 
affects the ability of the Armed 
Forces .... Homosexual acts are 
crimes under the Uniform Code 
of Military Justice. The policy 
states, Discharge for homosexu
ality can result from: 1) commit
ting homosexual acts; 2) at
tempting to commit homosexual 
acts; 3) stating the desire or intentto commit homosexual acts.
According to Vice President 
for Enrollment William Elliot, 
the University has been very 
aggressive on this issue. He has 
written many letters to Presi
dent Bush, Secretary of Defense 
Cheney, and members of the 
Senate and the House, suggest
ing the fact that people ought 
not be discriminated against on 
the basis of sexual orientation to 
defend the Constitution. Ac
cording to Elliot, the University 
is currently lobbying Washing
ton for change in its policy, and 
there are no plans to terminate 
any associations with ROTC on
campus.
Tomblyn acknowledges the 
actions of the University but 
feels it isnt enough. I am fully 
aware that for all the universi
ties that have ROTC ... Carn
egie Mellon has taken the lead 
in this issue, he said. How
ever, we think that this isnt 
working fast enough.
According to Wood, cmuOUT 
has also written 
letters to Presi
dent Bush on the 
discrimination is
sue, and Wash
ingtons responses 
to the letters have 
been that the is
sue is not under reviewatthe current 
time and that they are unable to 
listen to any complaints on the 
matter. He feels it is going to 
take additional pressures on the 
administration from other sides. 
If ROTC excluded blacks or 
women, said Wood, the Uni
versity would not hesitate to do 
something about it.
Altmann agrees that it is go
ing to take some more pushing 
for the administration to take 
action. Most of the rest of the 
civilized world has decided that 
homosexuality is totally irrel
evant to military service, he 
said.
TheresolutionpassedtheAcademic Affairs committee and the 
Executive Board of the Student 
Senate by a unanimous vote, 
and it passed the Campus Af
fairs committee unanimously
with one abstention. When 
brought in front of Senate as a 
whole, the resolution passed 
with a vote of 16-33.
Eric Moore, a junior chemis
try major, was a Senator who 
voted against the resolution. 
Moore could not see how allow
ing ROTC to remain on campus 
would cause any harm, but he 
could see how it would cause
harm if ROTC was forced to leave 
campus. I could not bring my
self to vote in favor of a resolu
tion that brought action against 
my constituents, he said.
There is a general agreement 
among Senate members that rid
ding the campus of ROTC is not 
the goal of the resolution. The 
majority of us agree that we dont 
want ROTC off campus," said 
Tomblyn. Instead, the Senate 
hopes to put increasing pres
sure on ROTC to cause it to 
change its policy.
Duane Williams, member of 
the Staff Council and cmuOUT, 
points out that having ROTC 
on this campus is incompatible 
with the Universitys non-discrimination policy. Williams 
believes that the mere fact that 
letters were sent to Washington
on the matter does not change 
the fact that CMU is violating 
its own policy of non-discrimi
nation. According to Williams, 
the resolution may cause other 
campus groups with more influ
ence, such as the Faculty Sen
ate, to put additional pressure 
on the administration.
No matter what the 
Universitys decisions are, one 
part of the 
Senate reso
lution is 
completely 
enforceable 
by the Stu
dent Senate. 
This clause 
states that 
no ROTC or 
ROTC-sponsored organization 
may participate in events funded 
by the student activities fee. Im 
surprised the Student Senate 
has chosen to take out their frus
tration on their fellow students, 
said Mazza. He points out that 
there are a number of student 
organizations within ROTC that 
are now unable to participate in 
events such as booth or buggy.
In addition, the Student Sen
ate takes a stab at the financial 
implications of the ROTC dis
crimination by including a clause 
in the resolution which reads, 
The Senate directs the Univer
sity to replace, in its entirety, 
the ROTC financial support of 
students who are or have been 
dismissed or forced to quit ROTC 
due to their sexual orientation. 
This follows the incident in
which the Carnegie Mellon stu- 
dent was forced to disenroll from 
the Navy ROTC and had his 
scholarship revoked.
According to Elliot, if a stu
dent is forced to disenroll from 
ROTC for any reason, weve met 
the full financial need of that 
student. However, the gay stu
dent who was forced to disenroll 
from NROTC received aid from 
the University totalling $3,000 ; 
less than the amount of his ; 
ROTC scholarship. He has had 
to get emergency loans to make 
up the difference. ,
It is ultimately up to the Unii 
versity whether to terminate \ 
ROTC programs on campus. I, < 
ofcourse,thinkitwillbealossto 
the University and the student ; 
body to have ROTC leave, said ;,) 
Mazza. We influence the Uni) 
versity and the University in) 
fluences us. . >
According to Ashli Thompson, 
cadet in the Army ROTC located 
at University of Pittsburgh and > 
a freshman architecture major 
at Carnegie Mellon University, ; 
Its foolish for the Student Sen) 
ate to try and kick ROTC off the  , 
campus when the cadets and the 
ROTC program have no say in -; 
the problem of homosexuality in > 
the Army. She also feels that ) 
the University would lose a lot 
of good students.  j
What Wood, Altmann, and 
Tomblyn hope for now is in'I 
creased pressure on the administration so it will take more . 
serious action against the dis
crimination within ROTC.
If ROTC excluded blacks or women, 
the University would not hesitate to 
do something about it.

FORUM
Senate challenges ROTC
Letters to the Editor
Student Senates Resolution 
Against Discrimination by 
ROTC at Carnegie Mellon is 
well-intended but is not an ef
fective solution to the problem 
of discrimination against gays, 
lesbians and bisexuals in the 
military. Many of the ways in 
which the Senate resolution pro
poses to penalize ROTC do not 
hurt the ROTC program itself. 
Instead, they hurt the students 
who participate in ROTC, and 
this is not an effective way to 
change a federal mandate.
The resolution calls upon the 
University to replace, in its 
entirety, the ROTC financial 
support of students who are or 
have been forced to quit ROTC 
due to their sexual orientation. 
We agree that students forced 
to leave ROTC because of their 
sexual orientation should be al
lowed access to the financial re
sources that may allow them to 
finish their degrees at Carnegie 
Mellon, but the University 
should carefully consider other 
options, such as instating the 
students normal aid packages 
which are based on need, before 
agreeing to cover the total loss 
of the ROTC scholarship. Guar
anteeing total reimbursement 
to students who have to leave 
ROTC hurts every student in 
the financial aid pool, and while 
its a nice gesture, it punishes 
the University and all the other 
financial aid recipients, not the 
ROTC program.
The resolution also suggests 
that the University limit ROTCs 
use of campus facilities. This 
might include prohibiting ROTC 
from marching on the Cut, us
ing the gym for physical train
ing, and participating in color 
guard before football games. 
Telling ROTC units that they 
may not use University facili
ties will hardly influence the 
Department of Defense officials 
in Washington to the extent that 
they will allow gays, lesbians, 
and bisexuals to participate in 
ROTC programs all over the 
country. Other directives of the
This buggy season, safety con
siderations have been treated 
as a low priority. Safety regula
tions have been poorly enforced, 
and this increases the risk to 
participants.
Buggy is a friendly competi
tion and a technical challenge, 
and with all the secrecy which 
surrounds the teams and their 
vehicles, safety is too often seen 
as a hindrance rather than a 
necessity. This cannot be al
lowed to continue. Safety should 
be the most important consider
ation for all involved. This in
cludes the safety of the pushers 
and drivers, and the safety of 
the course itself.
The safety rules are in place to 
protect the pushers, spectators, 
and most importantly the buggy 
drivers. The fact that there 
hasnt been a fife-threatening 
accident within recent memory 
doesnt imply or guarantee that 
the races are being conducted in 
a safe manner.
Cases have been observed of 
relaxed safety standards dur
ing practices recently. On one 
occasion cars, bikers and jogresolution are similarly ineffec
tive in reaching the policy-mak
ers in Washington, like not al
lowing ROTC units to partici
pate in Activities Fee funded 
events such as Carnival in 
ROTCs name. These types of 
measures only end up hurting 
the people involved.
Other parts of the resolution 
potentially carry a sting that 
will reach Washington where 
the authority to change the dis
crimination policy resides. These 
too are at certain expenses to 
the student body and the Uni
versity. One such dictate is that 
the University refuse to accept 
any new or renew any prior De
partment of Defense contracts. 
This may reduce research op
portunities and funding for re
search at the University for fac
ulty, staff and students.
The final point of the resolu
tion directs the University to 
terminate all contracts with 
ROTC by the end of the 199596 
school year if it does not change 
its policies dictating discrimi
nation based on sexual orienta
tion. This is a very strong mea
sure, and again, it would hurt 
the University by limiting our 
candidate pool. Students who 
wish to participate in ROTC and 
receive ROTC scholarship would 
not even consider coming to 
CMU. The resolution overlooks 
the fact that without ROTC 
scholarships a number of quali
fied students would not be able 
to attend CMU because offinancial constraints. A valuable 
group of students might be ex
cluded from CMU as a result. 
This is another decision which 
should not be taken lightly.
The intent of the Senate reso
lution is good. Some of the direc
tives might end up being effec
tive, but none of them are with
out some level of cost to the 
University community, and 
none of them should be entered 
into without careful consider
ation as to whether the means 
will move us toward the desired 
end.
gers were seen on the course 
during practice rolls and were 
not quickly escorted away. Not 
only should the entrances to the 
race course be more carefully 
monitored but the safety staff 
should be more quick to respond.
The Sweepstakes Committee 
needs to reevaluate its commit
ment to the participants of the 
race. It needs to present a more 
commanding presence at prac
tice rolls and the race itself. 
Making concessions under the 
pressure of organizations who 
want to practice as often as pos
sible must not be tolerated. 
Safety should be the primary 
concern.
The Sweepstakes Committee 
must strive to enforce and the 
Safety Committee must con
tinue to improve the existing 
rules and their execution. The 
teams must also try to work 
within the constraints and not 
tiy to bend the rules. With ap
proximately three months until 
spring practice, the Sweepstakes 
Committee and the buggy teams 
have time to get ready for their 
chance to win, and to do it safely.
Senate resolution hurts 
ROTC students unfairly
Editor:
I would like to re
spond to the recent dis
cussions on campus 
about CMU ROTCs 
sexual discrimination.
The main thing that most people are 
failing to realize is that the ban on 
homosexuals in ROTC is not a CMU 
ROTC policy. The policy comes from 
the Department of Defense which is an 
agency of the United States Govern
ment. Several methods were described 
to show the government that people 
dont like these discrimination policies. 
Mr. Wood said, Start by forbidding the 
use of campus facilities and finances by 
ROTC... Who does this really affect? 
This idea just hurts the students in 
ROTC. I really dont think forbidding 
the use of facilities will hurt the gov
ernment or really make them sit up and 
take notice, but it will definitely hurt 
the many ROTC cadets and midship
man of this University.
I think the real answer to change the 
policy of discrimination is really basi
cally simple. Dont we still live in a 
democracy? Our elected officials are 
the ones who govern this country. If 
you want a policy changed, lobby and 
vote for government officials who agree 
with you and who will change the policy. 
This is still America'. Dont try to change 
policy by punishing those that follow it. 
Once again this is not a CMU ROTC 
policy, so dont try to restrict it to that.

Student thanks Senate 
supporters of resolution
Editor:
I would like to 
thank the 16 student 
Senators who voted 
for the Resolution 
Against Discrimina
tion by ROTC at Carnegie Mellon on 
Tuesday, November 5. I especially 
thank Mike Tomlyn and Erik Altman 
for introducing and vigorously defend
ing the resolution.
The meeting was well conducted and 
I felt that most of the Senators were 
truly concerned about the rights of gays 
and lesbians on campus.
With the passing of this resolution, 
the Senate has delivered a clear mes
sage to the University that institution
alized discrimination will not be toler
ated on this campus.

Festival offered more 
than editorial
Editor:
Your editorial Fo
rum entitled Inter
national Festival 
falls short of hopes
[10/28] was disap
pointing for many of 
us who actually attended the events. It 
stood out as festival bashing as com
pared to a fairer and constructive analy
sis in the Living section of the same 
issue.
I agree with you that the festival 
scheduling, with respect to overlap with 
classes and proximity to midterms could 
be improved. I reluctantly agree with 
your criticism about the broad scope of 
the festival; a narrow coverage would 
have been limiting.
Your editorial did not fairly repre
sent the issues concerning publicity, 
content, profile, and turnout. Let me 
share my observations on these issues.
In terms of publicity, I read biweekly 
newsletters, bboards, 8.5xlls and The 
Tartan; received daily schedule of 
events in my campus mailbox; and saw 
posters at almost all major thorough
fares.
Your criticism of festival content 
seems puzzling when one looks at the 
list of events that the festival offered: 
storytelling, lectures, dances, personal 
journeys, arts & crafts, fairs, and reli
gious excursions, to name a few. These 
events covered economic, political, cul
tural, social, and culinary spectrums. 
And your criticism seems even more 
puzzling when one looks at the quality 
of speakers and artists who came from 
all over the globe; they were absolutely 
the best in their expertise and inspired 
me tremendously.
I was also surprised to read your 
assessment of the turnout. It could be 
better, but I attended several events 
which were jam-packed, e.g. the Indian 
Ambassador, Oopalee Operajita, Gala, 
Costume Show, Informational Booths 
and the Food Fair.
Was the festival fun? I say It was 
great! and I cant wait to attend the 
next one.

Intl Festival organizers 
deserve praise
Editor:
I am writing in con
nection with the In
ternational Festival. I 
think that Aliya Khan 
and the others who 
participated in the organization and 
completion of that event should be offi
cially commended by Carnegie Mellon 
University. I have read, in the columns 
of The Tartan, various criticisms of the 
way the Festival was handled, why it 
fell short of expectations and so on. 
While with hindsight it is always easy to 
suggest ways to conduct matters better, 
Khan and the ones who worked with her 
had the immense merit of starting this 
event from scratch, at almost every turn 
they had to use their imagination and 
their educated intuition, if I may use 
this assemblage of words.
Logistically, psychologically, and 
from the standpoint of pure physical 
stamina, the preparation and the actu
alization of the International Festival 
was a gargantuan undertaking. The 
printing of numerous and excellent in
troductory cards and booklets with in
formation (includingmaps) onthecountries of Asia, the foods and beverages 
served throughout the week to accom
pany the events, were by themselves, 
for instance, a very intelligent initia
tive.
From now on, other groups of students
can organize festivals on various parts of 
the world (big or small), and they will 
benefit immensely from the knowledge 
of what prepatory work was performed 
and how events went with the public, at 
this years festival. While President 
Mehrabian deserves credit for providing 
moral (and other) support, it is the stu
dents themselves, like Khan, who had to 
sacrifice a lot of their own precious time. 
It has been noticed that quite a number 
ofCMUers, ratherthan attend the festi
val, felt safer to concentrate on studying 
and on preparing for exams. This is not 
a criticism, nor, of course, should it be. 
Every student sets his/her own priori
ties. But credit ought to be given where 
credit is due.

Students offer view of 
graduate life at CMU
Editor:
Graduate students 
are members of a nu
merous yet dispersed 
and heterogeneous 
group. Our demand
ing work schedules and strong depart
mental affiliations further discourage 
formation of a unified graduate stu
dent community. Perhaps for these rea
sons, our needs and experiences have 
not been well articulated in the past. 
This may also explain the seeming in
difference of the university adminis
tration to graduate student welfare.
The recently revitalized GSO prom
ises to become an increasingly effective 
advocate for graduate students. This 
welcome development has the poten
tial to benefit the entire campus. We 
believe, however, that it is important 
for everyone to recognize that graduate 
students at CMU have needs and expe
riences significantly different from 
those of undergraduates. Two examples 
will substantiate this claim.
The first example concerns health 
insurance. Lastyeara30percentjump 
in the cost of the student health insur
ance galvanized the graduate student 
population. This jump in insurance pre
miums did not, however, have the same 
dramatic effect on undergraduates. Per
haps this is because many undergradu
ates are carried by their parents health 
plans. The GSO Health Insurance Com
mittee formed to address this issue 
continues to pursue this matter with 
the Office of Student Affairs.
The second example pertains to the 
responsiveness of university adminis
trative offices to graduate student 
needs. The Associate. Provost for Aca
demic Projects, Dr. Barbara Lazarus, 
has developed what has become known 
as the Graduate Student Luncheon 
Seminars series. Initiated 4 years ago, 
this series of programs has included 
over 14 seminars on such salient topi 
as Facing the Qualifiers and Over
coming the Dissertation Blues. She 
has raised necessary funds herself, and 
sought graduate student guidance by 
formingagraduate advisory board. This 
has been accomplished with a very small 
staff.
In contrast, the Office of Student

Schedule variety 'edifies the soul
f
-------
Jason McDonald
Ah, Registration! Its the time of year 
that all of us look forward to  we can 
tend, just for a moment, that we arent 
ng to have to finish the classes we 
have now. At least thats what I think of 
. that and the goldenrod paper.
This years registration presents me 
flith an interesting dilemma. Nobody's 
telling me what to take! Prior to this 
semester, the IM department had my life 
planned for me; now that Ive jumped 
through all the core curriculum hoops 
theyve presented, I havent got a clue as 
to what I actually want to do with this 
last semester.
Actually, I have got a clue  a very 
jod clue. I want to learn something 
different. Broaden my mind. Take classes 
that never bring up the GNP, manage
ment by objectives, or standard deviation. Do the edify the soul thing.
This brings me to my present state. I 
have classes in philosophy, history, En
glish (well, Im on the wait list), psychol
ogy, and industrial management, as well 
as my karate course that Claudia 
Kirkpatrick is going to throw a fit over 
whenever I get around to turning my sched
ule in. Not exactly the schedule of the 
upwardly mobile senior.
The natural inclination will be for people 
to brand me as a slacker. Im not further
ing my resum enough; ergo, I must be a 
lazy, unmotivated, unproductive member 
of society. The CIA is probably starting a 
file on me as I type these words.
Theyll call it senioritis. Naturally, 
someone had to come up with a itis-word to 
give independent thought a negative con
notation. The connection is obvious: If you 
do anything different from what your 
power-hungry, ambition-driven classmates 
do, you are abnormal and should be shot, 
or at least kept away from the rest of us. 
Strangely, my goals are the same as those 
of the Fifth Year Plan, but no one gets good 
public relations off it.
The natural inclination will be for people to 
brand me as a slacker. Im not furthering my 
resum enough; ergo, I must be a lazy, 
unmotivated, unproductive member of society. 
The CIA is probably starting a file ...________
To their credit, my battalion of advi
sors havent given me any problems. 
Claudia even seemed to think it was a 
good idea that I got out and did my own 
thing. Its more my fellow students that 
are giving me the questionable looks 
when the schedule comparisons start.
I remember sitting in Strategic Man
agement listening to a group of people 
talk about all the IM courses they were 
going to take next semester. Thats so 
sad, because it suggests one of three 
things about them, or I suppose it could 
be some combination of the three.
D .They dont have enough imagina
tion to be interested in other subjects. 
Alternatively, thesepeople actually find
these classes to be life-enriching enough.
2) Theyre too career-oriented to see 
anything but the dollar payoff of a CMU 
degree. Since not having the perfect de
gree might put this cash in jeopardy, 
they dont want to rock the boat, there
fore missing the tremendous opportu
nity that they have, being at a worldclass university.
3) The University has these people 
way too buried under core curriculum, 
so theyre still finishing up their re
quired courses. I dont buy this one be
cause it doesnt explain why I have a free 
semester while these other people dont.
The solution to the first problem is to

Senate resolution fails to 
account for all students
Chris Restifo
On November 5, 1991, Stu
dent Senate, claiming to be rep
resentative of the student body 
here at Carnegie Mellon, 
passed a resolution that, among 
other things, called for the re
moval of ROTC from campus 
by the year 1996 if it does not 
drop its discrimination policy 
against gays, lesbians, and bi
sexuals. Im glad to see that 
some people believe the end 
justifies the means.
Of course, the policy does dis
criminate against gays. Per
sonally, I dont like it. If some
one does his or her job and does 
it well, it shouldnt matter what
sexual orientation that per
son has, just like it shouldnt 
matter what the persons sex 
or skin color is.
Recently, weve seen a move 
away from the discriminatory 
policy. Secretary of Defense 
Dick Cheney said that the 
policy was a bit of outdated 
procedure that he had inher
ited. More and more people 
are becoming aware of the 
report, sponsored by the De
partment of Defense, that 
found gays and lesbians could 
serve just as well as others 
without posing security risks. 
Additionally, the military has 
lost face due to its policy be
cause some gays and lesbians 
who were being forced out 
proved that they did their jobs 
in an exemplary manner.
Some people out there, however, believe that instead of 
following the rational path of 
lobbying the Defense Depart
ment to change its ways, it 
would be better to get ROTC 
removed from college cam
puses. Im sure these people 
also prefer to treat the symp
tom rather than the disease. 
The Student Senate resolution, 
which hopefully wont be taken 
seriously by the administra
tion, contains several flaws that 
the intelligent reader will be 
able to point out.
Part of the resolution reads: 
Whereas, Carnegie Mellon 
Universitys Statement of As
surance states Carnegie Mel
lon University does not dis
criminate in admission, em
ployment, or administration of 
its programs on the basis of...

CMLPs Solid Waste Reduction 
Program in the past year. While 
recycling is an important piece 
of this process, reducing and re
using are equally important.
Our current recycling prac
tices go beyond the law and will 
continue to grow. For example: 
glass is not mandated for insti
tutions to recycle but we have 
established 11 drop off locations 
throughout the campus for glass.
Our Recycling and Solid Waste 
Reduction Program is rapidly 
maturing and there are more 
opportunities, improvements, 
and information being devel
oped. Let me quickly mention 
some of the projects in the works: 
the implementation of a glass 
recycling station in Skibo, im
provements in the Housing Re
cycling Program, development 
of a cardboard recycling system 
and acting upon opportunities 
to recycle items such as phone 
books.
Research is being conducted 
to formulate proposals for a solid 
waste reduction plan and a mar
keting strategy for the purchase
of environmentally friendly pa
per products at CMU. More in
formation will become available 
through a major campus wide 
promotional program and a Re
cycling Update.
Please read and use the 
cmu.environmental-health-andsafety Bboard as an open forum 
for communication about CMLPs 
recycling and solid waste reduc
tion process. I would like to take 
this opportunity to thank every
one for their participation in 
successfully recycling 141 tons 
of office paper and corrugated 
cardboard, 22 tons of glass, and 
3 tons of aluminum cans in our 
first year of the program.
Our vision of CMU becoming a

System is on the way to being 
realized.

Editor's Note: According to 
Campus Police, an internal cita

action administered by Student
Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) 
should be internationally 
banned. To repair the ozone 
layer, implement the following 
method:
First, manufacture liquid 
ozone (LOZ). Then, load the LOZ 
aboard large military refueling 
tanker aircraft. These planes 
would then climb to the lower 
level of the ozone layer at forty 
thousand feet. As they spray the 
LOZ, the stronger upper jet 
stream winds will carry the 
ozone even higher into the ozone 
layer.
The ozone layer could be main
tained at its normal level after 
the initial restoration project by 
a minimal number of annual 
flights. I estimate the initial 
ozone restoration will take from 
one to five years and cost be
tween fifty and seventy million 
dollars. Since this is a global 
crisis, cost should be shared by 
the members of the United Na
tions.
I urge everyone to clip out this 
letter and send copies to scien
tists, environmental groups, the 
EPA, UNESCO, their congress
men and senators, and Presi
dent Bush.

I think Carnegie Mellon 
should install answering ma
chines in all dorm rooms. CMU 
needs to put two lines in each 
room also.
Molly BrennanFreshman

Oh, I definitely think that 
CMU should expand service, 
especially call waiting. It does 
depend on the cost. Everyone 
else has it, so CMU should have 
it.
Brett Smith JuniorIndustrial Management
Carnegie Mellon might as well 
expand the telephone system. I 
want to have call waiting and all 
the other services the Univer
sity can offer. If CMU is one of 
the best schools in the country, it 
should have an expanded phone 
service, because the other schools 
have it.

I definitely want call wait

yearning to get call waiting. Now 
that I am senior I wont get to 
use the new service, but I think 
CMU should have it.

I think call waiting should 
be a fact. Immediate call back 
should be put in to stop the 
dumb calling games people 
play. Also, CMU should get 
rid of that dumb ACUS sys
tem.

put more free electives earlier in 
college careers. If you give stu
dents the opportunity to explore 
before theyve made the 100 per
cent plunge into a particular 
field, they may just be happier 
over the long haul. Finding out 
in retrospect that youre inter
ested in something different, like 
writing, really sucks. Trust me 
on this one.
The second problem relates to 
having far too many Type A 
personalities on this campus.
Theres not a whole lot that can 
be done about this, though. 
People are what they are  its 
sort of hard to change them at 
this point.
The last point is one that I 
dont buy, but if its true, can 
also be fixed by lowering the 
required classes a few notches. 
For example, do I really need to 
know anything about differen
tial equations or 3-D calculus to 
get an IM degree?
I would hope to come back 
here some day and see more
people like me. People who arent 
afraid to take the classes theyre 
interested in, rather than tak
ing the classes that will look 
best in the Resum Book. Even 
if those students will be isolated 
in a separate dorm down in Pan
ther Hollow, so they wont give 
the motivated children any bad 
ideas.

Resolution misplaces blame
RESOLUTION, from page 7
sexual orientation.  CMU does not run 
OTC here. All terms of admission and 
employment are determined solely by 
jhe Department of Defense. For ex
ample, the Chief of Naval Education 
aBd Training (CNET) determines who 
gets Naval ROTC scholarships. CMU 
has no control over who the recipients 
are.Concerning admissions, the resolu
tion states: Whereas, the Admissions 
Office of Carnegie Mellon confers with 
OTC officers concerning prospective 
students during the application pro
cess... The Admissions Office also con
fers with CMAP and University alumni.
Although ROTC does discriminate 
against gays and lesbians, I fail to see 
how CMU can actively discriminate by 
merely associating with ROTC. Receiv
ing a ROTC scholarship does not deny 
or guarantee someone admission to a 
university. In fact, to receive a scholar
ship, a person must be accepted at an 
accredited university or college.
ROTC has no decision concerning 
who gets accepted at a school. Any 
liaison that goes on is for recruiting 
purposes only. Thus, CMU cannot dis
criminate against gays in admissions 
when it comes to ROTC. ROTC, how
ever, can discriminate with respect to 
scholarships. Again, I do not agree with 
the Department of Defense policy 
against gays.
One part of the resolution foolishly 
assumes that CMU has authority over 
ROTC. Whereas, a Carnegie Mellon 
student has been forced to disenroll 
from ROTC due to his sexual orienta
tion, and this is clearly a violation of 
University policy... CMU has no influ
ence over how scholarships are run. It 
does not determine requirements or 
objectives that must be met. CMU does 
not discriminate with respect to finanrial aid or admission of ROTC pro
grams because, again, it does not run 
the programs.
Finally, the most blatant form of ig
norance is evident in this part of the 
resolution: Whereas, ROTC, includ
ing Army ROTC, NROTC, and 
AFROTC, is directed by Department of 
Defense policy which prohibits gays, 
lesbians, and bisexuals from service... 
Read what it says. ROTC is run by the 
Department of Defense, not by Carn
egie Mellon University. CMU has no 
say over who receives a scholarship. It
the one fought by Vince Eirene to re
move Department of Defense funding. 
If, say, SEI were removed, the money 
would simply go to some other school 
like MIT or Stanford.
If you want to change the policy, 
youve got to get the attention of those 
who make it. Kicking ROTC off campus 
does nothing more than alienate those 
who make the policy and the students 
in it. It alienates the very people who,
If you want to change the policy, youve got 
to get the attention of those who make it. 
Kicking ROTC off campus does nothing more 
than alienate those who make the policy and 
the students in it
cannot discriminate against gays and 
lesbians in this respect.
At this point, I would like to make 
apparent a very important distinction 
between military science and actual 
ROTC. The officers who run ROTC are 
also professors here. As professors and 
assistant professors, the officers must 
obey CMU policy. Thus, anyone can 
take a military science class.
On the other hand, though, the offic
ers are in the military. When it comes 
to ROTC related matters like scholar
ships, policy, etc., they must follow the 
directives of the Department of De
fense. These things have nothing to do 
with Carnegie Mellon University. As I 
have stated before, CMU does not run 
ROTC.
The only part of the resolution that 
makes sense is the section calling for 
Carnegie Mellon to join with other in
stitutions of higher learning to force 
the Department of Defense to change 
its policy.
This is what should be done, not try
ing to kick ROTC off campus.
In fact, this revolution is much like
in twenty to thirty years, will be run
ning the military. Theywont look highly 
upon any proposed change from people 
who had their ROTC programs re
moved.
By now, the people who wrote, spon
sored, and supported the resolution are 
probably furious. Good. Im furious, too. 
I just want to know one thing, however. 
Do they realize that by removing ROTC, 
they deny benefits not only to gays, but 
to hundreds of other people as well?
If they were to get ROTC kicked off 
campus, would they be willing to  as 
the resolution itself reads  replace, 
in its entirety, the ROTC financial sup
port of students who are or have been 
forced to quit ROTC because of the 
Student Senate resolution?

engineering. He would like to remind 
readers that the opinions expressed in

They are not, nor should they be con

AIDS tumbles even 
the mightiest idols
AIDS, from page 7
rus ability to strike heterosexuals.
Magic is also black. His illness 
comes at a time when AIDS is movingthrough the black population at 
an alarming rate. Magics high vis
ibility as an educator will hopefully 
reverse this trend.
I hope people of all races will be 
nauseated by endless pictures and 
interviews featuring Magic with a 
condom draped over his forefinger. 
This will hit home more with black 
youths than an army of tired old 
sex ed teachers and boring nurses. 
The best thing that could come out 
of Magics tragedy is that he will be 
the finest spokesman for AIDS that 
America, especially black America, 
could have.
The strongest images of Magic 
will come later, if AIDS crumbles 
the once-great man. Remember 
Magic now, as the beefy, strong 
man that he has been all of his life. 
When this happens, view him as 
the victim of a terrible disease which 
has the possibility to snatch life 
from each and e veryone of us. See
ing him will also give the disease a 
greater human face.
Until now, celebrities like Miles 
Davis, RockHudson, andPerry Ellis 
have kept the disease under wraps. 
The only pictures we have seen 
were of them before the final stages, 
when they were still relatively 
healthy. The images of AIDS pa
tients in their final days are the 
ones which tell most about the 
diseases crippling effects. Magic 
will hopefully hold fast to his com
mitment as a spokesperson, and 
not keep the cameras away in the 
weeks before his death.
The moral of all of this is simple, 
and youve heard it before. AIDS
can get anybody. Wear a condom or 
make sure your partner has one on. 
If your partner doesnt, don't have 
sex or oral sex. If you shoot drugs, 
use clean needles. If we dont learn 
this stuff soon, there are going to be 
hundreds more celebrities who will 
wind up with AIDS. Or there will 
be millions of people like you and 
me with it. End of moral.
As a side note, I would like to 
thank the students of CMU for their 
courtesy over the past month. I am
The best thing that

used to people darting by me on the 
way to class, not holding doors for 
others, and other generally rude 
behavior. But three weeks ago, I 
broke two ofmy toes and was forced 
to use crutches. All of a sudden, 
students would patiently walk with 
me to class. Others, whom I didnt 
know, held doors for several sec

This shattered my conception of 
CMU students as brash and not 
courteous. Thanks.

Football team battles playoff system
Bad writing 
surrounds 
Magic story
Of course, the big sports 
news this week is that Magic 
Johnson tested positive for the 
HV virus and retired from 
basketball. Every sports 
columnist in America is 
churning out pages of text on 
the subject, so I decided to try 
something a little different: a 
column about other columns. 
My first impression of the 
flood of text is that it takes a 
very twisted value system to 
talk about the loss to pro 
basketball. Magic has to give 
up his livelihood, and even 
worse, has his very existence 
put on a running clock, and 
writers are lamenting the fact 
that we wont see him on the 
Olympic team in Barcelona.
What the hell is wrong with 
these people? According to the 
odds, the man is going to die. 
Who gives a damn whos going 
to get his position in the 
starting lineup, or what this 
does to the Laker salary cap? 
The next line on this event is 
the Magic and Me stories. 
Unfortunately, I dont have 
any of those colorful personal 
reminiscence stories about 
Magic Johnson that other 
columnists have. True, I 
stayed in the same St. Louis 
hotel as the Lakers once, but 
thats not much of a deeply 
moving experience. What 
should I say? That he gave the 
staff good tips?
Not only that, but it gives 
me the feeling that the writers 
think themselves more impor
tant than Magic. Magic, we 
sure hope you stay healthy. 
Think of the effect on Mike 
Lupica! Hes going to be so 
depressed.
Theres another school of 
writing that rambles on about 
how great it is that AIDS has 
a champion like Magic John
son. Its a very valid point, but 
also rather callous. Certainly 
not as sickening as talking 
about the effect on basketball, but it once again dehumanizes 
Johnson. It almost seems to 
say that we wouldnt care 
about him if he didnt go public 
with his illness.
The last major vein of 
writing deals with how uplift
ing it is to see that Magic still 
has a positive attitude. This is 
the one part that I dont think 
people are dwelling on enough. 
If Magic can go on Arsenio 
Hall and say (Im paraphrasg here) If I die tomorrow, it 
doesnt matter because Ive 
had a great life, then it makes 
Be feel kind of silly to bitch 
and moan about having too 
much homework. Im not 
saying that I won't bitch, but it 
Wont feel right.
The Algeristic lesson of 
Magic Johnsons tradegy has 
We to do with AIDS or 
basketball. Its more a mes
sage that theres nothing that 
happens to us that we cant 
sal with. Alternatively, I 
suppose the intimidating 
Message is that things can 
Ways take a turn for the Worse.
Either way, whc; or you
j^nk things aro: gbad,
nk about. _hnson,

jShtmarish reality of all.

Swim teams launch seasons at Wooster
The CMU mens swim team started its 1991-92 season with a 118-104 victory over the College of Wooster. The womens team didnt fare quite as well, losing to Wooster's 
women, 156-56.
[The freshmen] swam very well, and 
the older members looked very 
strong
 Jim Cutrone, 
head swim coach
By DARYL DAVIS
Tartan Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon swim 
teams traveled to the College of 
Wooster Saturday to open their 
1991-92 seasons. The mens 
team came away with a tight 
victory as CMU toppled the 
Wooster team 118-104. The 
womens team was unable to 
defeat the nationally-ranked 
Wooster women, however, and 
fell by the score of 156-66.
The mens team was able to 
take advantage of the depth of 
their members to beat the un
known mens team of Wooster. 
The Tartans were led to victory
by powerful individual efforts of 
members like junior James 
Millar.
Millar came away from the 
meet with two first-place fin
ishes; he took first place in the 
200-yard individual medley with 
a time of 2:08:32 and also cap
tured first place in the 200-yard 
breast stroke with a 2:54:24 per
formance. We looked very, very 
strong, said Millar.
Despite the team loss, there 
were several individuals who 
performed well for the womens 
team. Senior Glynis Frost cap
tured three placement finishes. 
She won a first place in the 200- 
yard individual medley with a
time of 2:25:01. She then went 
on to place second in both the 
500-yard freestyle and the 1000- 
yard freestyle with the times of 
5:44:02 and 11:44:03, respec
tively. Sophomore Denise 
Fenwick was also a multiple 
winner, receiving a first-place
finish in the 200-yard freestyle 
with a time of 2:03:05, a second 
place in the 100-yard freestyle 
with a time of 56.38 seconds, 
and a second-place performance 
in the 200-yard breast stroke 
with a time of 2:38:03.
The small number of members for the womens team was a 
key factor in this meet. Consid
ering the lack ofnumbers, said 
Millar, I think they did the best 
they could. Were very happy 
with how they did.
The youth of the team was 
also a concern, with a majority 
of swimmers for both teams be
ing freshmen and sophomores. 
Coach Jim Cutrone stated, how
ever, Im very happy with how 
the freshmen swam. They swam 
very well, and the older mem
bers looked very strong.
The swim teams will have their 
first home meet of the season 
this Saturday, hosting John 
Carroll University at 1 pm.

urday  needed at least two of the top 
six South region teams to lose in order 
to keep their playoff hopes alive. The 
top four teams in each region advance.
They got their wish, as top-ranked 
Lycoming knocked off number-three 
Susquehanna 3531, fourth-ranked 
Millsaps lost to Rhodes College (no score 
available), and Emory & Henry took 
care of fifth-ranked Ferrum, 28-10. 
Sixth-ranked Washington & Jefferson 
kept itself in contention with a 49-0 
win over Muhlenberg.
This leaves just two undefeated teams 
intheSouthLycoming and Dickinson, 
who beat Gettysburg Saturday, 26-0. 
W&J, Susquehanna, and CMU all have 
one loss. Millsaps and Ferrum have 
two, and are most likely out of the 
playoff picture.
Now the Tartans must win their final 
game, a University Athletic Associa
tion matchup against Case Western 
Reserve on Saturday, to remain in the 
hunt.
The only thing we can do at this 
point is to wait until next week, said 
head coach Rich Lackner. The Case 
game is going to be critical. Should we 
lose, we dont deserve any recognition 
in terms of the South region, and we 
dont deserve to go on to post-season 
play.
If the Tartans beat Case, it would 
boost their record to 9-1, their only loss
coming at the hands of defending na
tional champion Allegheny, 23-12, in 
the season opener. It would also give 
them a more-than-solid argument for 
being in the top four.
Not that their argument wasnt strong 
to begin with. After last Mondays 
rankings were releasedwith the Tar
tans seventh  CMU Sports Informa
tion Director Bruce Gerson wrote a let
ter to the South region selection commit
tee, stating that CMU is undeniably one 
of the four best teams in the region.
Going into last weekend, the Tartans 
were ranked 13th in the nation in Divi
sion III. They have won 21 of their last 
23 games, their only other defeat coming 
at the hands of1990 Division III runnerup Lycoming in the first round of last 
years playoffs. Among their more memo
rable victories was a 17-7 win over W&J 
in 1989.
But even now, with the Tartans poten
tially moving up to fourth or fifth in the 
South, questions still remain about the 
integrity of the rankings. The biggest 
question is why W&J is ranked ahead of 
the Tartans? W&J is only ranked 23rd 
nationally, ten places lower than CMU.
Both teams have one loss, but CMUs 
loss was to the top-ranked team in Divi
sion III; the Presidents lost to Roches
ter, which is not only an unranked team, 
but a team the Tartans beat, 18-14. In 
addition, Rochester beat W&J atW&Js 
homecoming, while the Tartans won on 
the road, at Rochesters homecoming.
Thats the toughest pill to swallow, 
said Gerson. Not only did we beat a 
team W&J lost to, our win came on the 
road and theirs was at home.
One answer that has been given by 
committee member Robert Deming, Ath
letic Director at Ithaca College, is that 
the selection committe feels CMU doesnt 
play enough teams in the South region.
There are a serious number of criteTartan file photo
Last year, the Tartans had to wait until the last week of the season for an invitation to 
battle Lycoming in the Division III playoffs, despite a 10-0 record. This year, a 9-1 record 
may not be good enough, as the Tartans were seventh in the region as of the last poll.
ria we look at, Deming was quoted as 
saying in The Pittsburgh Press last 
Wednesday. We wanted them to add 
some opponents from the South, and 
while they are doing that, I think the 
committee believes they do not play 
enough teams there. The committees 
attitude is that they only played two 
very weak teams (Grove City, and
Duquesne) in the South region, and the 
committee is questioning whether it should 
give up a playoff position to someone who 
has not played any teams there.
True, Grove City and Duquesne are com
paratively weak teams in the south, but 
W&J also plays both teams. They are obli
gated to, because of their ties to the

Editors Note: The following article was origi
nally supposed to run in the November 4 issue of 
Ike Tartan. The Tartan apologizes for the delay.
The CMU mens and womens 
joss country teams competed in 
dual meet on Saturday, No
vember 4, with Robert Morris 
College. While it was handled as 
a ]ow-key match for both squads, 
ithelped to prepare the teams for 
theupcomingNCAAEastemRegional Championships.
Although the womens team 
lost 2728, the overall times im
proved. Junior Laura Sibley 
placed second overall, followed 
by junior Wendy Evans in third.
Also placing in the top ten were sophomore Aliza 
Hildebrand in fifth, senior Emily Burke in eighth, 
and freshman Karen Bryla in tenth place overall.
The team was without senior Carolyn Lowe, but 
coach Dario Donatelli has high hopes for his 
number one runner. Only one team from each 
region gets picked to go on to the nationals, so as 
team I feel it will be difficult, but I feel that

On the mens side, the team did very wellthey 
rested a lot of their key members to keep them

Its hard for me to say anything negative about 
this team, said coach Gary Meckley. Theyve 
been running well for a long time. 
If we run at the regionals at the 
same level as the UAA champi

Carnegie Mellon football clashes with Division III playoff system
PLAYOFFS, from page 13
Presidents Athletic Conference, 
of which Grove City and 
Duquesne are also members. 
CMU used to belong to the PAC, 
but left after the 1989 season to 
join the UAA.
In the PAC, W&J also plays 
Thiel and Bethany, and those 
guys have had tough years the 
last couple of years, said line
backer Mike Hession. We play 
Adrian, who was 4-0 when we 
played them. Coast Guard had a 
winning record, so did Roches
ter. The last two years weve 
played the team thats been in 
the national championship. So I 
dont think were ducking any
body in our schedule. We just 
have UAA obligations, and the 
schedules were made four years 
I dont see how we can get 
penalized for that.
I dont think we should change 
our league just to suit the com
mittee, said senior halfback 
Drew Pizzurro. I think we have 
to stand by it, and if going 9-1 
and beating all the teams in the 
UAA is not good enough to get 
into the playoffs, so be it.
Part of the problem is that the 
selection committee in charge of 
ranking South region teams is 
comprised of eight South region 
Athletic Directors. Among these 
are John Luckhardt, who is both 
Athletic Director-and head foot
ball coach at W&J, and Dennis 
Riccio, the head football coach 
at Frostburg State  the team 
se fmal-week loss in 1990 
gave the Tartans a playoff berth.
We dont have a coach on the 
committee, so that puts us at a 
disadvantage, said junior line
backer Mike Kondas. Teams 
like W&J and Frostburg have 
coaches on the committee, and I 
definitely think theres a prob
lem with that.
The bottom line is that CMU 
should have been ranked fourth 
all along. Prior to Saturday, 
Millsap had lost to unranked 
DePauw University, Ferrum 
bad lost for the third time in
nine games, and W&Js loss was 
to unranked Rochester. The Tar
tans had lost only to top-ranked 
Allegheny, had won their last 
eight games, and had beaten 
Rochester.
Its hard to find where the 
justice is, said Pizzurro.
Tve read in the newspaper 
that the committee doesnt feel 
were that strong of a team, 
said Gerson. Well, were ranked 
thirteenth in the country accord
ing to the Football Gazette  in 
the country, not thirteenth in 
the region and were not even 
in the top six in the region. Its 
absurd.
The fact that the Tartans were 
not in the top six teams before 
Saturday, given the facts, is 
cause to believe that there was 
more involved in the standings 
than wins and losses and who 
plays who.
W&J claims that their loss to 
Rochester doesnt count because
five starters were suspended for 
that game, so it was a special 
situation. Meanwhile, they still 
had their starting quarterback 
and their star running back, and 
they turned the ball over eight 
times against the Yellowjackets.
Football is a game of special 
situations. Any team, on any 
given week, can make excuses 
for losing. It takes a big team to 
admit that they just didnt play 
well, and W&J doesnt appear 
ready to do that. If theyre look
ing for sympathy, theyve obvi
ously found a group of people 
who will give it to them. Unfor
tunately, that group is the com
mittee that ranks South region 
teams, and there is no represen
tative of CMU on that commit
tee.
I really think the system is 
unfair, added junior linebacker 
Jim Cooke. Its overweighted 
towards those teams that have 
coaches on the committee, and
Were ranked thirteenth in the 
country... and were not even in the 
top six in the region. Its absurd.
 Bruce Gerson, 
Sports Information Director
were not one of those teams. 
Maybe CMU should be one of 
those teams. Or maybe there is 
some way for the committee to 
be made up of impartial athletic 
directors. True, the ADs ofteams 
in contention for the four playoff 
spots do not have a final say in 
whp goes to the playoffs. All ADs 
with vested interest take them
selves out of the decision, but 
even that m ay not undo the dam
age done.
The groundworks been laid, 
said Gerson. The whole season, 
youve got to get in position. 
Thats why its important to be 
ranked early and keep winning. 
If you keep winning, youll stay 
there. If you lose, youll drop 
out, but at least youre near the 
top to begin with.
Last season there was contro
versy as well. The Tartans were 
10-0 and still didnt make it into 
the top four until after Frostburg
State lost its final game and 
dropped out. It is almost incon
ceivable to think that an 
undefeated team wouldnt make 
the playoffs.
The committee meets today to 
update the poll's, so the Tartans
 who were off on Saturday  
will find out how many spots 
they have moved up. Given 
Saturdays turn of events, CMU 
should at least be fifth  possi
bly fourth if Susquehanna drops 
out altogetherand will have a 
good chance at the playoffs, pro
vided they win against Case.
Hopefully we can beat Case, 
and hopefully we can do that in 
a convincing way that will im
press the committee, said 
Lackner.
If the new rankings are done 
fairly, the Tartans fate will now 
be in their own hands. It should 
have been that way all along.

Columnist misses merits 
of pay-per-view football
Before I start in on the Na
tional Football League, I want to 
take a shot at commercialism at 
the college level this week. Weve 
all heard of pay-per-view. Dial a 
number, watch whatever movie 
that you could rent from out-ofdoors for cheaper, or watch a 
pretty boring boxing match, 
maybe Wrestlemania XX, or that 
spectacular sporting event, the 
Swimsuit Open. No cost to your phone bill, the 
charge will show up directly on your cable bill. 
Yeah?
Okay. I admit, Ive seen one boxing match on 
pay-per-view (because my dad wanted to see it) as 
well as one movie that wasnt worth the $4.50. But 
football is a classic sport that creates its own hype. 
It pulls its own money from network broadcasting 
and crowd attendance. Especially Notre Dame, 
who worked out their own special college football 
television contract (an aberration to college foot
ball and another reason that everyone should 
hate ND).
ABC proposed, and subsequently scrapped, the 
idea of making this Saturdays Notre Dame-Penn 
State game a pay-per-view game. The deal is that 
the whole country wont see the whole game, but 
if TV watchers out West want to see the game, 
they dial a special number and watch what could 
be an interesting game and find themselves out 
ten dollars. Its an okay idea really, if the games 
that would have been broadcast in place of the 
ND-PSU in other regions were big, interesting 
games.
But I foresee a problem in broadcasting. If ABC 
sees the ND-PSU matchup one worthy of pay-perview status (the first football game to be such), 
why dont they televise it nationally, at no extra 
cost to us, the customer? I see it as an abomination 
and a step toward some really cruddy games being 
shown regionally. And I dont mean WVU-Rutgers, 
but Lehigh-Navy. Thats pretty bad. Nobody wants 
to see that, so they pay to see Miami-Florida 
State. Then they pay to see another NFC team 
dominate the Super Bowl.
Speaking of NFC teams and Super Bowls,

tonights game pits two teams 
who really have no chance of be
ing the NFC representative in 
the Super Bowl. But, it could be a 
vaguely interesting game any
way. The Chicago Bears will visit 
, the Metrodome to play the ViNFL FOOTBALL kings. I think the home team 
by Dave Martin wouldstandabetterchanceifthe 
Twins were coming out to play, 
but with Minnesota and Chicago 
one rarely knows. Expect a tough game, but not a 
thrilling one. Bears 27, Vikings 17.
On Sunday, there are two playoff-relevant 
games. The Dallas Cowboys are in second place in 
the NFC East, and will be eyeing a strong wildcard 
bid (they wont catch up to the Redskins to take 
the division  Phil Simon told me so). The New 
York Giants are still alive, but theyre fading fast. 
This will be their wake-up call. If the Giants dont 
win, they can kiss any wild repeat scenarios 
goodbye. And the Cowboys will be making their 
first playoff appearance in four years (at least). 
Look for the Giants to look to next season starting 
the fourth quarter of this game. Cowboys 34, 
Giants 13.
A much more interesting game takes place in 
Kansas City, as the Chiefs host the divisionleading Denver Broncos. The Chiefs could viably 
take the division again this year, and I think they 
will. But they must win Sunday over Elway and 
the Broncos. They will. Chiefs 28, Broncos 24.
And in the rest of the NFL: Atlanta to lose to the 
Buccaneers, the Saints over San Diego at Murphy 
Stadium, the Bears easily over the Colts in India
napolis, the Jets over the Patriots, the Raiders at 
home over the Seahawks (but dont take my word 
for it), the Lions over the struggling Rams in the 
Silverdome, Minnesota over Green Bay just be

By NICOLE BROCKMANN
Tartan Staffwriter
How do you host a party for two hun
dred people and escape without any 
legal liabilities?
Some Greek organizations are trying 
to find the answer in a program called 
'risk management. Under increasing 
awareness of legal responsibilities and 
liabilities, fraternities and sororities are 
beginning to take a closer look at their 
own internal policies, especially where 
alcohol comes into play.
Risk management, according to Phi 
Kappa Theta Social Chair Andy 
Edmonds, is a set of guidelines put 
together by insurance companies that 
insures national fraternities, not indi
vidual chapters.... Theoretically, thegoal 
of risk management is to reduce the risk 
of something bad happening.
Seven of Carnegie Mellons 14 frater
nities and two of the five sororities are 
members of a national risk manage
ment group known as the Fraternity 
Insurance Purchasing Group, Inc., or 
FIPG. Participatingfratemities on cam
pus include Alpha Epsilon Pi, Alpha 
Tau Omega, Delta Upsilon, Kappa Delta 
fiho, Pi Lambda Phi, Sigma Nu, and 
Theta Xi. FIPG sorority members on 
campus are Delta Gamma and Kappa 
Alpha Theta.
In addition, four Carnegie Mellon fra
ternities have adopted risk manage
ment policies that are very similar or 
identical to those of FIPG, although 
they are not official members. These 
fraternities are Beta Theta Pi, Delta 
Tau Delta, Phi Kappa Theta, and Sigma 
Alpha Epsilon.
Though much of the publicity and 
controversy surrounding risk manage
ment centers on the availability of alco
hol at chapter-sponsored events, FIPG 
and similar risk management policies 
are much more than just rules for par
ties.
The FIPG policy also contains regula
tions on drugs; hazing; fire, health, and 
safety; education; and sexual abuse. One 
of the few changes which have been 
made in the FIPGs policy since its in
ception in late 1987 is the abolition of 
kegs in fraternity houses and the prohi
bition of the purchase of bulk quantities
of alcohol (such as a keg) by a chapter. 
In addition, the policy prohibits any 
member from permitting, tolerating, 
encouraging, or participating in any 
drinking game.
Many are looking to the bring-yourown-bottle strategy as a way to survive 
abolishing the keg in accordance with 
risk management policies. But can 
Carnegie Mellon successfully convert 
to a BYOB system?
One thing that should be emphasizedisthatriskmanagementdoesnot 
equal BYOB, said Edmonds. I think, 
for this campus, BYOB is not really an 
option, and that seems to be the gen
eral consensus among most folks. 
Right now, I dont think theres a 
problem with the way fraternities serve 
alcohol, said sophomore mechanical 
engineering student Lisa Drake. I 
dont know how much things would 
actually change under a BYOB policy. 
I think the parties would probably be 
smaller. I dont think they would be as 
much fun.
It would definitely be something to 
get used to, said senior industrial 
management major Jennifer Sherer. 
It would be a hassle and an inconve
nience for a lot of people, but the frater
nities would still be the place to get a 
lot of people together. It might open up 
off-campus parties more and make area 
bars more frequented, which would be 
kind of neat. It also might make for a 
better mix of people at parties.
I think it would cause more prob
lems than there are now, said Sheela 
Kosaraju, also a sophomore mechani
cal engineering student. If the pur
pose of BYOB is to get fewer people to 
drink, then thats not going to help. 
There will be bottles and glass every
where. It wont make the drinking on 
campus any less.
Pat Hamed, assistant to the dean of 
Student Affairs, disagrees that frater
nities are not giving thought to chang
ing their policies. I think were head
ing in that direction [towards BYOB], 
she said. Nationals want their chap
ters to enforce risk management poli
cies. People are realizing that as indi
vidual fraternities, itll be a lot harder 
to enforce a BYOB policy than [to en
force the policy] as an IFC group.
i**
Kosaraju agreed, saying that she 
would probably be less likely to go to a 
party under a BYOB system. All of the 
parties are very similar. Theres less of 
a hassle at non-BYOB parties, and 
theres not enough difference between 
the parties that would make me want 
to go to one in particular, especially if 
its BYOB, she said.
According to FIPG president Sidney 
Dunn in AFA Perspectives, a publica
tion of the Association of Fraternity 
Advisers, Chapters are safer today 
under BY OB than they were four years 
ago under open parties, kegs, et cetera.
Edmonds disagrees with that prin
ciple. Saying that you dont have kegs 
doesnt say anything about how safe 
the party is.
Under a BYOB policy, the person 
bringing alcohol would be carded at the 
door. One of the big questions about 
BYOB is do you let the person keep 
track of their own alcohol, or do you 
take it to the bar and give them a claim 
ticket to drink it? said Edmonds, add
ing that many other campuses use a 
claim ticket system to help the fraterni
ties retain control over who was drink
ing and who wasnt.
Daniel Frey/Tartan Photo Staff Manager
The fraternities want to have a policy, 
they need to have a policy, but the 
question iswhos going to enforce it? 
said Hamed. The Universitys alcohol 
policy says that theres no public con
sumption of alcohol, like on fraternity 
porches or outside the houses. Were 
assuming that what goes on inside 
houses is in accordance with Pennsyl
vania state law. Its an internal thing 
for houses. If they choose to follow risk 
management procedures, they do, and 
if they dont, they dont.
As a University, we havent made

Fraternities consider alcohol policy alternatives
By ORYA DASNA
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
I think there should be some 
things we should be doing col
lectively at this point [regarding 
the alcohol policy], because 
theres a lot of outside pressure 
not so much from the school, or 
from the city, or from anywhere 
else, but from our nationals to 
get things done. Matt Ireland, 
the president of Inter-fratemity 
Council (IFC) is referring to the 
national governing bodies which 
create the policies, including 
those regarding alcohol, of each 
fraternal organization at Carn
egie Mellon.
These national govemingbodies have been responsible for the 
changes in the alcohol policy of 
fraternities. The current rules 
which IFC has instituted in
clude, among others, checking
I.D.s at the door and distinguish
ing guests over or under 21 by 
some visible form, refusing to 
serve those who are visibly in
toxicated, and providing alter
native beverages at alcoholic 
events. However, according to 
the nationals, these require
ments are not enough: They are 
pushing for increasingly strict 
measures for the way the frater
nities handle alcohol, especially 
at official house parties.
The need for change stems not 
so much from the Carnegie Mel
lon campus, but from larger 
schools. According to Ireland, 
Our nationals went on a big 
crusade to rid their own liability 
so they went to all these differ
ent campuses  places where 
there was a big risk because 
there are a lot of people, hazard
ous parties going on, places that 
werent self-contained, cam
puses that were spread out. 
There was no one policing it ex
cept the fraternities themselves. 
They can get themselves in a lot 
of trouble with the city police or 
the state police.
The issues that apply to the 
larger schools do not always re
late to Carnegie Mellon. Its a 
different situation [because] ev
erything is policed by our own 
Campus Police. Thats pretty 
good because everything here is 
self-contained.
However, Ireland does not feel 
that demography is justification 
to ignore the guidelines of the 
nationals. I think its realistic 
that they say we should change 
also and its good for [the nation
als] to point out our liabilities. 
It is, however, difficult to mea
sure us to some of the other 
schools.
A driving force behind most of 
the nationals is the Fraternity 
Insurance Purchasing Group 
(FIPG). FIPG is the risk man
agement company to which all 
the Carnegie Mellon fraterni
ties belong, with the exception 
of Beta Theta Pi, Kappa Sigma, 
Pi Kappa Alpha, and Sigma Al
pha Epsilon. The FIPG policy 
forbids common sources of alco
hol, such as kegs or party balls. 
Ireland says that pretty much 
all fraternities have the same 
guidelines, but not all of them 
are FIPG. Our policy (Sigma 
Alpha Epsilons) states that [col
lective alcohol sources are for
bidden] and other policies, too, 
but FIPG is more specific than 
other policies.
An alternative to common
sources of alcohol is BYOB. Many 
members of the Greek commu
nity concur with Ireland in be
lieving that the disadvantages 
of BYOB prevail.
For this campus, I do not look 
favorably upon a BYOB situa
tion. There are a lot of problems 
with that. Once you go to BY OB, 
the situation isnt self-contained 
anymore. Although Campus Po
lice would still police the area, 
at least the fraternities try to 
police themselves enough to keep 
it in the quad area, with the 
exception of Sigma Tau Gamma 
and Alpha Epsilon Pi. AEPi 
doesnt serve alcohol at their 
functions, so its not a problem 
for them, and Sigma Tau 
Gamma has not, to my knowl
edge, had many problems keep
ing [the parties] contained in 
their own area. I think its really
scary to think it might not be 
self-contained anymore. People 
would be walking around with 
what they want to drink and go 
wherever they want with it. 
To make one point clear, I 
dont think anyone wants to go 
away from the present system 
because its a system that every
body enjoys. People like the idea 
of kegs because theyre cheap, 
they serve a lot of people, theyre 
pretty hassle free. [There are] 
no broken bottles, no hard li
quor being pushed in anyones 
face, no worries about recycling. 
The struggle for consensus on 
these alcohol issues, however, 
is not a problem which plagues 
the sororities. Unlike IFC, the 
Panhellenic organization of 
womens fraternities is not a 
policy-making body. According

Internship experience assists Harriet Schwartz at work
By TRUPTI PATEL
Tartan Staffwriter
A short stint with the Pitts
burgh Pirates is what indirectly 
brought Harriet Schwartz to 
Carnegie Mellon. Schwartz, a 
new assistant to the dean of Stu
dent Affairs, joined the CMU 
staff in July.
Schwartz was a journalism 
major at Duquesne, and during 
the summer before her senior 
year she had an internship in 
the Pirates public relations de
partment. It was a lot of fun, 
but I also realized it wasnt what 
I wanted to do for the rest of my 
life, says Schwartz.
Schwartz went on to study in 
a different field. I went to 
Springfield College in Massa
chusetts and got a masters in 
counseling and also a certificate 
of advanced study in student 
personality  its like a creden
tial just beyond the masters, 
she says.
After getting her masters, 
Schwartz worked at a number of 
different jobs. One was as an 
academic advisor for a Division I basketball team at the Univer
sity of Hartford. Schwartz her
self is an avid basketball player
and enjoys watching and play
ing a number of different sports.
Although she did not end up 
pursuing a career injoumalism, 
Schwartz says that graduating 
as a journalism major has been 
extremely helpful to her in her 
work at CMU. [My] job as edi
tor-in-chief of the campus paper 
really was decent preparation 
for this field, she says, pointing 
out that her job on campus is a 
manifold task with multiple re
sponsibilities much like news
paper work. She deals with both 
community service and commu
nity relations.
That involves working with 
the Squirrel Hill Urban Coali
tion, which is a group of neigh
bors who live right near Carn
egie Mellon and are concerned 
with things that go on here, 
says Schwartz. She says that 
community relations also involves inviting members of the 
community to participate in re
cent campus events such as the
International Festival.
On the downside of this part of 
her job, Schwartz says, Occa
sionally a neighbor will call with 
a complaint about a student  
so I deal with that too. Some of 
her other responsibilities include 
acting as a liaison with the In
terfaith Council, the Registrars 
Office, and the College of Hu
manities and Social Sciences.
Schwartz also works with 
Asian and Asian-American stu
dent affairs, which she says ba
sically involves making herself 
available to work with groups 
such as Focal Point, KSA, ASA, 
and others. However, she tries 
to provide support to any other 
campus organizations as well as 
students who need her help.
One of the programs which 
Schwartz coordinates is The 
Gathering Storr, which is a de
bate forum for current issues. 
The Gathering Storr is 
Schwartzs current project.
Schwartz says that she truly 
enjoys her work at Carnegie 
Mellon. The campus is excit
ing; its a very vibrant campus. I 
think in part because of the way 
its laid out  you know, with 
the Cut, the football stadium 
right across, and CFA, and
Skibo. Because so much of the 
activity is centralized, its very 
exciting. You can walk out on 
the campus at three oclock in 
the afternoon and you can hear 
the band practicing and you can 
see people playing volleyball. Its 
just a very lively place and I 
think thats exciting, she says.
One ofthe other features about 
the campus which Schwartz 
likes is the diversity of students. 
She says that students are not 
only racially and culturally di
verse, but also diverse in terms 
of their interests, their majors, 
and the way they think.
One of the main goals of Stu
dent Affairs, she points out, is to 
provide a campus in which stu
dents are happy. Part of the 
challenge for us is to try to make 
[CMU] a better place and 
whether that means providing 
support to students who are hav
ing difficulty, or developing pro
grams that engage students and 
help them feel better about this 
place, its all part of our jobto 
make it a better place for stu
dents, Schwartz says.
Although Schwartz is kept 
very busy with her job here, she 
finds time to do the things she 
enjoys outside of work. For in
Dlane Keen/Tartan Photographer 
Harriet Schwartz signs upfor the garbage lugsponsored by Earthwlse,
stance, she says that she espe
cially enjoys attending Pirates 
baseball games and taking walks 
through all the parks in Pitts
burgh. She also likes to attend 
cultural events such as the sym
phony and the opera.
Schwartz continues to write 
as well  a vistage of her days 
as a journalist. Some of 
Schwartzs family is also in Pitts
burgh, so she enjoys spending 
time with them.
Schwartz says that her goal 
for the future is to someday earn 
her doctorate. But she says she 
sees herself staying on at CMU
as long as her job continues to 
challenge her and as long as she 
feels like shes doing some good.
One of the most important 
messages she would like to send 
to students is that they have to 
do the things they like. One 
thing that I learned in college is 
that its easy to get sofocusedin 
your work that you dont make 
time for other things. Remem
ber those things that are lighter 
and more fun and make time for 
those things. Its really impor
tant to strike that balance be
cause it can rejuvenate a per
son, says Schwartz.
FIPG enforces risk management
POLICY, from U
great strides on this, she added, 
largely because its not yet an issue [at 
the University level].
A new five-point alcohol policy for 
Carnegie Mellon Greeks, enforced by 
Inter-Fraternity Council executive of
ficers, went into effect on September 8. 
The policy states that all fraternities 
must record the names of all guests at 
functions where alcohol is present. All 
fraternities must also check IDs and 
distinguish those who are 21 or over 
from minors by some form of visible, 
non-transferable signal, like a 
hands tamp. All fraternity parties must 
also have specified beginning and end
ing times, after which no alcohol may 
be served. All fraternities must refuse 
to serve those who are visibly intoxi
cated, must provide alternative bever
ages at all alcoholic events, and must 
have a sober brother/sober patrol 
system, where a specified number of 
brothers will remain sober during all 
events. Finally, all fraternities must 
keep an up-to-date copy of their na
tional alcohol policy in the IFC files to 
be used for reference.
Thinking to the future, many houses 
are taking the initiative to educate 
members about liability and risk man
agement. Risk management and na
tional policies have had the biggest 
impact on house officers, said Hamed.
In many fraternities, the presidents and 
other officers have to sign risk management 
contracts, and therefore they are assuming 
liability for what goes on in their houses
 Pat Harned, 
Assistant to the dean of Student Affairs
In many fraternities, the presidents 
and other officers have to sign risk 
management contracts, and therefore 
they are assuming liability for what 
goes on in their houses. So officers usu
ally take FIPG pretty seriously. 
Younger members arent as aware of it 
and therefore pay less attention.
Hamed stressed the importance of 
risk management education in the 
Greek system. They need to make ev
eryone aware of and understand the 
policies, because then all members 
would be more in support of the policies 
and would watch out more for people 
who are visibly intoxicated, people who 
shouldnt really be walking home, and 
things like that, she said.
A lot of people on the quad are trying 
to do some intelligent things to manage 
risk, said Edmonds.
Last year, we brought in a lawyer to
speak to IFC members, and each house 
was able to send a few people, said 
Hamed. The lawyer talked a lot about 
risk management, Pennsylvania state 
law, and the liabilities that could be 
incurred. A lot of fraternities also take 
advantage ofthe Take 30 programs run 
by the Division of Student Affairs to 
educate members, and education is built 
into most pledge programs.
In addition, IFC has sponsored alco
hol awareness and education programs, 
and the Greek community participated 
heavily in Alcohol Awareness Week.
Many fraternities are trying to take a 
pro-active stance to risk management 
by educating members and by watch
ing over events before they get out of 
hand. What were doing with IFC is 
more pro-activethings like having a 
sober guard that keeps an eye out for 
trouble spots.
BYOB considered 
unnecessary at CMU
BYOB, from LI
to Rriss Evans, the president of 
Panhel, There isnt an overall alco
hol policy instituted by or enforced by 
Panhel. Its all the individual houses. 
Our policy is you follow what your 
national tells you to do.
Evans feels that a Panhellenic al
cohol policy would only cause compli
cations. Its hard to do something 
overall because nationals have set up 
their own policy and if Panhel tries to 
institute something, it may conflict 
with what nationals want and thats 
where we run into problems.
Intrinsically, Evans believes that 
the sororities do not need a collective 
alcohol policy. Were not alcohol 
based. We dont have the problems 
[that fraternities do]. We dont have . 
the parties every weekend. We dont 
have to worry about someone getting 
killed after leaving our party. Essen
tially, theres not a problem. Why fix 
something thats not broken? 
Conversely, the fraternities na
tionals assert that their policies need 
to be fixed. Ireland states, I think 
the best policy for this school is we 
have to start abiding by what our 
nationals say, and I think we have to 
face the inevitablefactthatthey want
us to move towards their idea of a 
good risk management policy. What 
people are really avoiding is [that 
our] nationals dont want us to serve 
alcohol [at parties]. I think thats 
what it really comes down to.
On the contrary, Ireland does not 
believe that such extreme measures 
will be taken. I dont think anyones 
going to be forced to go dry or any
thing drastic. However, he does 
maintain that the fraternities must 
deal with the inevitable changes that 
their national governing bodies are 
initiating, in one way or another. If 
people dont necessarily want to 
change the situation now, at least we 
should come up with plans on how to 
approach it when it does happen, 
because it will. From the other per
spective, if the nationals dont see us 
doing anything, theyre goingto make 
us do it without letting us do it our 
own way. We might as well do our 
best with it now.
I think its nice that people just 
want to enjoy the situation while we 
can do it, but I think its going to come 
hell or high water and I think we 
might as well bite the bullet now and 
figure out some ideas to work the 
new situation.

I rapidly approach my 
^enty-second birthday, some
thing is really troubling me. No, 
jts not less hair, slowing down, 
or being five years past my 
seJUal peaklean live with all 
ofthose.
You see, the other day I went 
into a Toys R Us store to browse 
around, just like I used to do 
when I was a little kid. Within 
ten minutes the most frightenng feeling washed over me like 
, massive tidal wave.
I was bored.
Thats right, I was bored inide a Toys R Us.
I was bored in the same store 
itwhichmymotherusedtodrop 
me off when she needed to run a 
quick errand (which would 
usually take at least two hours), 
the same store I used to have 
dreams about livingin, the same 
store in which I must have spent 
at least a year of my childhood 
inside and loved every single
icond of it.
I was bored inside the worlds 
biggest toy store.
It was at this terrifying mo
ment that I realized what I was 
feeling  the loss of my child
hood. Im not exactly sure when
LIFE; THE UNIVERSE 
AND STEVE
by Stephen Glicker
this happened (probably some
time duringmy sophomore year) 
or why this happened (probably 
had something to do with a com
bination of growing up and a 
CMU workload), but it was only 
now that I was beginning to re
alize this great loss.
Quickly I left Toys R Us and 
proceeded directly to the nearby 
mall  I had to see just how 
much of my childhood was gone, 
how much damage had been 
done. First stop, the video ar
cade.
Ah, the arcade. I had such 
fond memories of that magical 
electronic place, where I used to 
play video games for hours on 
end (and where my girlfriend 
would patiently wait for me to
finish). Nothing was better than 
spending an entire afternoon in 
an arcade.
As soon as I entered, I got a big 
handful of those all-powerful 
quarters (the only unit of cur
rency in an arcade) and began a 
leisurely stroll around the place.
Should I play Street Fighter? 
I thought to myself. Nah, too 
boring. How about RoboCop or 
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles? 
No, those look boring too. 
Hmmm, come to think of it, all of 
these games look pretty mind
less. However, those pinball 
machines over there sure look 
like a lot of fun!
Wait a second  did I just 
think that? Did I just think that 
a pinball machine was more ex
citing than a video game?
A deep chill ran up my spine 
as I fully contemplated that last 
thought ... the fact that one of 
my most cherished forms of 
childhood entertainment was 
now mindnumbingly boring to 
me. W orse yet, I really wanted to 
play pinball. The game which I 
used to consider not so long ago 
as the old timers game. I 
quickly left the arcade and 
headed straight for the food

court.
Okay, maybe this isnt a bad 
as it looks, I thought while walk
ing toward the food court. 
Maybe its not me, but the games 
themselves. Yeah, that must be 
it! The games themselves were 
boring and Im just fine! That 
has to be it! But why then was 
the arcade full of people? I tried 
to dismiss this last piece of logic 
as I reached my destination.
I stood in the center of the 
court and began to contemplate 
the various selections surround
ing me  pizza, gyros, tacos, 
pasta, fish, hot dogs... the possi
bilities seemed endless. Now 
what should I have? I thought. 
Or, more importantly, what 
would I have eaten for lunch five 
years ago? I began to probe the 
deepest areas of my mind, try
ing to remember what I used to 
eat years ago. A com dog? Ice 
cream? French files? Nah, I cant 
have any of those, theyre not 
good for you. Maybe Ill have 
some lightly breaded fish and a 
nice diet....
Wait a second  did I just 
think that? Did I just tell myself 
that I couldnt eat something 
because it was bad for me? I
would never have done some
thing like that five years ago.
Suddenly, I wasnt feeling so 
hungry anymore.
As I lumbered out of the food 
court, I recalled the one favorite 
childhood hangout I still had 
leftthe record store. One small 
spark of hope still remained.
Soon I was staring at the 
record store, one of the last great 
memories from my childhood. 
The place where I could spend 
an hour or two just grazing 
through the CD bins. Where I 
would contemplate buying that 
new Madonna, Duran Duran, 
Debbie Gibson, or Bon Jovi al
bum. Where I Would....
Wait a second  did I just 
think about buying a Top 40 
album? I hate Top 40 with every 
single ounce of my being. Give 
me classic rock any day of the 
week over that Top 40 crap. Sure, 
I used to like it when I was 
younger, but now....
Wait a second (again)  did I 
just think that? Did I just think 
about not buying something 
young and youthful and instead 
thought about buying something 
even older than me?
I didnt even go into the store.
I just went straight home.
As I was driving home, I 
couldnt help but think how 
much Ive changed over the past 
years. The fact that I dont mind 
doing homework so much any
more, I actually prefer my but
ton down shirts over my old Tshirts, and that Tetris isnt 
nearly as much fan now as it 
was freshman year, are all clear 
signs that my final years of child
hood have come an end.
Hanging out in shopping 
malls, riding my bike every
where, curfews, casual dating, 
an allowance, Saturday morn
ing cartoons, sugar cereal, Little , 
League, comic books, Nintendo, 
homework that took less than; 
an hour to finish; all of these  
items are now part of my past. 
Sure, I could try and relive these 
experiences, I could try and re
capture the magic and the inno
cence of my childhood, but it 
wouldnt be the same.
And it never will be.

|Vlr. Fraternity raises money for charity
gy M.K. RODGERS
jartan Forum Editor
Mr. Fraternity 1991, presented by 
Kappa Alpha Theta sorority, took place 
]Jst Friday night in a packed Skibo 
Ballroom. The annual charity event 
centered around 15 contestants, one 
fjoni each of the 14 social fraternities 
^ one from Alpha Phi Omega, a ser
vice fraternity, that participated for 
t{ie first time this year. The proceeds 
fiom the program benefit the Karin 
Johnson Memorial Asthma Lung Asso
ciation, established to research Sud(jen Asthma Death Syndrome, which 
took the life of Theta sister Karin John
son in 1984. According to emcee Maggie 
ijobkin, a senior design major, Mr. Fra
ternity has raised approximately $7,600 
oyer the last four years.
; Mr. Alpha Tau Omega, Brian Ly scik,
junior in ECE, was named Mr. Fra
ternity 1991-92. Second place went to 
Mr. Delta Upsilon, Chris Andries, a 
sophomore art major. Mike De La Cruz, 
Mr. Phi Kappa Theta, a sophomore in 
ECE, took third. Mr. Congeniality was 
awarded to Mr. Beta Theta Pi, sophonlore mechanical engineering major 
I}eron Haley.
Jn various segments of the program, 
participants competed in beach wear, 
toga wear, talent, and formal wear. The 
competitors were awarded points by
the judges on stage presence, spirit, 
originality, and synchronization. The 
judges points made up two-thirds of 
each contestants scores, with the other 
one-third being determined by audi
ence vote.
In the beach andtogawear segments, 
each contestant modeled his rendition 
of the designated attire. In the talent 
competition, each representative was 
permitted to do just about anything he 
liked, as long as it did not last longer 
than five minutes. Formal wear was 
similar to beach and toga wear.
The choice of beach wear by each 
contestant occasionally had connection 
with the individual fraternitys atmo
sphere or traditions. For example, De 
La Cruz, Mr. Phi Kappa Theta, surfed 
across stage to the theme music from 
Hawaii Five-O, a popular tune at Phi 
Kap. A flex-ofF of sorts began during 
this segment between Mr. Pi Lambda 
Phi, Tom Hummel, ajuniorECE major, 
and Mr. Kappa Sigma, John Rosenberger, a senior in economics.
Toga wear featured each contestants 
rendition of the Greek toga. The incar
nations of the toga spanned from a 
formal, complete with top hat, bow tie, 
and cane, modeled by Mr. Sigma Tau 
Gamma, senior IM major Jim Irwin, to 
the camouflage toga and high-powered 
squirt gun of Mr. Alpha Phi Omega, 
Nate Szewcyzk, a junior in biology.
In talent, the performances ran from 
Haleys classical piano performance to 
several original rap music perfor
mances, including Lysciks Mr. Fra
ternity Rap. Billy Joel songs were also 
popular with contestants, as Sig Taus 
Irwin performed Piano Man with 
back-up from some fraternity brothers, 
andMr. Alpha Epsilon Pi, H&SS sopho
more Doug Brook, attempted to explain 
the philosophy of CMU with his rendi
tion of Pressure.
In the formal wear competition, the 
contestants were escorted onto stage 
by representatives from each of the five 
sororities on campus and APhi O. Some 
contestants gave lighthearted answers 
to the questions posedby emcee Dobkin, 
while others took the opportunity to 
make good with the judges.
Despite some problems with the mu
sical arrangements, the technical as
pects of the show  from lights to 
microphones  were handled well by 
AB Tech. The contestants appeared to 
take the problems and the occasional 
waiting in stride, and were very outgo
ing in communicating with the audi
ence and their fraternity brothers, who 
turned out en mass to support their 
representative. Theta is thankful to 
the fraternities for their support as 
well as to Student Senate, for its par
tial funding of the event. Mr. Frater
nity 1991-92 was crowned by last years
Tom Hummel, Mr. Pi Lambda Phi, competes In the Toga competition during Friday 
nights Mr. Fraternity contest.
Mr. Fraternity, Jason Bareford, an 
H&SS sophomore and a member of Phi 
Kappa Theta. The crowd was largely 
supportive of the entire event and ap
preciative of Thetas efforts to raise 
funds and provide an evenings enter
tainment for members ofthe CMU com
munity.
Lausanne, Switzerland welcomes architecture and engineering majors
fiy GREG SMITH
fartan Staffwriter 
JAMES ROCHE
& DANIEL RAZUM
Special to The Tartan
The CMU exchange program 
with the Ecole Polytechnique 
Fedrale de Lausanne, (EPFL), 
nowl5years old, offers aunique 
opportunity for engineering and 
architecture majors to study 
Dad as exchange students. 
TtieEPFL.locatedinLausanne, 
Switzerland, is one of the most 
renowned technical institutes in 
Europe. Located on Lake Geneva 
in' the French-speaking region 
o Switzerland know as Sises 
Remande, the EPFL offers CMU 
students immersion in current 
European technology and resejarch as well as the centuriesold European culture.
As opposed to most other for
eign study programs offered by 
CMU, the EPFL exchange lasts 
for a complete year, allowing 
students to integrate themselves 
into Swiss culture. While CMU 
runs several exchanges designed 
for majors in the humanities and
arts, the EPFL exchange exclu
sively targets third-year engi
neering and thirdand fourthyear architecture students  
majors not traditionally involved 
in study abroad programs. Fi
nally, as the EPFL is an official 
exchange program, EPFL course 
material is recognized, and 
credit is fully transferable to 
Carnegie Mellon. As with the 
other exchange programs, stu
dents financial aid still applies.
This allows exchangees to 
graduate on time at CMU, just 
as if they had remained in Pitts
burgh for their entire under
graduate careers.
The language of instruction at 
the EPFL is French, but there is 
no need for alarm. In fact, many 
former exchangees had never 
studied French before arriving 
in Switzerland. For these stu
dents, and for those who feel 
they want to brush up on their
tional, intensive, three-month, 
summer French course included 
as part of the exchange.
The city of Lausanne, north
east of Geneva, is connected by 
train to all major European cit
ies. Set against a backdrop of 
French Alps, the city is ideally 
located for short weekend trips; 
hiking in the Alps, skiing in 
world class resorts, or visiting 
international cities like Zrich 
and Basel. The downtown area 
of Lausanne is centuries old, and 
streets weave around cathe
drals, banks, and markets.
The EPFL, over 120 years old, 
has almost completed a move to 
its new suburban campus on the 
outskirts of Lausanne. Themodem university center offers the 
most up-to-date laboratories and 
equipment in Europe. For the 
engineering student, this ex
change opens up many opportu
nities for research and involvethe newest technology. For the 
architecture student, the EPFL 
has the reputation of being one 
of the foremost universities for 
the study of architecture and 
urban design.
The staff of professors comes 
from a myriad of foreign coun
tries, and offer the architecture 
student a chance to study in a 
completely new and challenging 
atmosphere.
At this new university center,
students from around the world 
study and take part in the cul
tural opulence of Lausanne.
The break between the winter 
and summer semesters is five 
weeks long. This break occurs 
during the month of March, 
which is one of the best times to 
travel around Europe; there are 
not many tourists around, and 
the weather is warming up. 
Traveling as a resident is al
ways more fun and informative
than going as a dumb tourist. 
Trains are the lifeblood of trans
portation in Europe, and they 
retain a charm and excitement 
of their own. Students have 
gone to Hell (Norway) and back 
during this break; others have 
toured Western Europe, and still 
others have visited the Soviet 
Union. Besides fun and excite
ment, such travels provide an 
invaluable exposure to other 
people and other cultures.

Beauty and the Beast 
attracts young and old
! gy IVDKE SHAPIRO
Jartan Senior Staffwriter
With apple pie coated with car
cinogenic preservatives and 
Mom being something of a nag 
these days, Walt Disney may be 
the only remnant of the Ameri
can Way worth fighting the 
! forces of darkness to preserve.
The magic for which Disney is 
'exalted is in its ability to mix 
childish whimsy with adult so
phistication, doing so in a way 
thats palatable to both Grandma 
and the squirming Ninja Turtle 
devotee on her lap. The language 
iuust be simple, yet not suspiciously contrived. The characters must be caricatures, yet 
reflective enough of real world 
personalities so as not to alien
ate the viewer. The storyline, 
music, and dramatic themes 
must be familiar and graspable, 
yet not trite or obvious. Its a 
tough job, but Disneys got to do 
itthe soul of our nation hangs 
in the balance.
But fear not, for Disney has 
done ityet againwith thennewest extravaganza, Beauty 
and the Beast, staving off the 
end of Americas childhood for 
another few years.
The raw statistics of the film 
are staggering. If previous 
Disney credits read like a Whos 
'Who in Animation, these read 
like the latest.census report  
over 600 animators, more than 
one million drawings, three and 
a half years of work, and a team 
of artists and throngs of assis
tants for each character. Glanc
ing at this gargantuan direc
tory, one wonders what on Earth 
Disney could be up to. The quesMovie Review 
? BEAUTY AND THE
BEAST. Walt Disney does it again 
with their 30th full-length animated 
feature.
tion is answered during Beasts 
opening sequence, when a florid 
French countryside pans past 
you in animated 3-D, revealing 
prancing and singing peasants 
who look more realistic thanyou 
do.
The story is, as the titular song 
goes, as old as time. However, 
this doesnt stop Disney from 
rejuvenating a slightly eerie old 
yam into something delightful 
for all ages. In the parable-style 
prelude, a vain prince is trans
formed into a hideous beast with 
a voice that would send James 
Earl Jones scamperingup a tree. 
Hes given the standard grace 
period until his twenty-first 
birthday to find someone with 
whom to fall in mutual love. 
Should he succeed, the enchant
ment will be dispelled. Other
wise, itll be time to fill the cup
boards with Purina Beast Chow.
We are then introduced to 
Belle, a beautiful but oddly in
tellectual girl who yearns for 
adventure. Belle is pursued by 
Gaston, a self-obsessed macho 
boor who easily outdoes his sy
cophantic assistant Le Pou in 
being the comic center of the 
film. Belles eccentricfather, lost 
and in need of shelter, stumbles 
across the Beasts castle, which 
is populated by talking furni
ture and household supplies. The 
old man is promptly imprisoned 
by the Beast for criminal tres
pass. When Belle pleas for her 
fathers release, the creature 
agrees to free him in return for 
the young girls signature in in
delible ink on the guest roster. 
Belle heroically complies, and 
settles down for a long stay. As 
time passes, the unlikely couple 
begins to fall in love.
This is about as far as the 
original story goes, but Disney 
throws on an added twist when 
the jealous Gaston learns of the 
Beast and leads a rampaging 
mob to storm his castle. The 
climactic final confrontation is a 
mix of King Kong and Home 
Alone, and a fine tribute to 
Disney theatrics.
All of this is fine entertain
ment, but what has tradition
ally gotten the Oscars rolling is 
music. For this purpose, Disney 
reeled in the talents of Howard 
Ashman and Alen Menkin, 
known for their award-winning 
music for Little Shop of Horrors, 
and more recently, the Little 
Mermaid. While falling short of 
the stirring majesty of Mer
maids score, the six main songs 
serve as more than mere plot 
advancement schemes. By far 
the most amusing of these in
volves the disgruntled Gaston 
trying to retain the structural 
integrity of his ego by touting 
his virtues to an admiring crowd. 
(In the midst of describing his 
ownmasculinity, Gaston croons, 
and every last inch of mes cov
ered with hair.1 ripping open 
his shirt in order to drive the 
point home  I nearly lost it.)
The introductory opening 
theme, Belle, is perhaps the 
most moving qua music, and 
serves to immerse you in the

colorful world on the screen. 
Unfortunately, most of the other 
pieces seem somewhat unin
spired, which is a shame consid
ering the emotional potency of 
the rest of the film.
Lyricist Howard Ashman also 
played a major part in the storys 
development, suggesting many 
of the films elements  such as 
the talking household objects  
that give it its unique charm. 
(Sadly, Ashman passed away 
last March, and the last well 
hear of his fanciful eloquence 
will be in the upcomingAladdin.)
Beast has a few flaws. Most 
notable amongthese is the film's 
uneven pace. Lengthy musical 
asides are allocated large blocks 
of time, while crucial plot points 
are hurried through. Perhaps 
Disney expected the audience to 
draw from their own knowledge
of the fable; in any case, the 
effect is somewhat disconcert
ing. The main and supporting 
characters, while likeable, seem 
like rehashes of standard Disney 
archetypes. (Theres more than 
a little Ariel in Belle, despite the 
deliberations of her creators to 
give her a more mature person
ality, and the Laurel and Hardy 
combination of Cogsworth the 
clock and Lumiere the candle
stick doesnt really achieve the 
comedic synergy it should.) And 
the use of slapstick humor 
(largely inflicted upon the hap
less Le Fou) is overdone and 
begins to grate after the first 
few off-the-cuff blows.
Nonetheless, Beauty and the 
Beast remains a charming, ex

mouth to boot.Prince fails to Gett Off on his new album Diamonds and Pearls
By MARNIBOREK
Tartan Asst. Diversions Editor
Prince, formerly the purple-clad pintsized wonder, may have successfully 
changed his physical appearance by 
trimming his hair, ridding himself of 
the glittery violet suits, and cutting his 
shoe heel size down from seven to five 
finches, but he has failed in altering his 
musical styl. The driven dance beat, 
the sexual lyrics, and the backup group 
are the ingredients Prince usually uses 
to lure music consumers, and he does 
not fail in repeating this tactic on his 
latest release Diamonds and Pearls. 
But Princes feeble attempt on the al
bum to expand his musical horizons 
can be compared to an L.L. Cool J 
nightmare of collaboratingwithBarbra 
Streisand on a rap project.

tory excited crowds with monotonous 
dance songs. Sadly enough though, 
Prince does not produce such positive 
results with his recent experimenta
tions.
On the tracks of Diamonds and 
Pearls, Prince explores dance, rap, jazz, 
and love song music. He has no trouble 
carrying across the dance music in his 
usual style, and his band, the New 
Power Generation, carries off the rap 
songs well, but Princes jazz and ro
mance tunes are nothing but cheesy.
Princes first musical tinkering is 
found in the songStrollin. The tune is 
only appropriate in a chaise lounge 
atmosphere due to the light cymbal and 
keyboard backing up Princes sugary 
voice. One can almost imagine Prince 
in light blue polyester pants serenad
ing sixty-year-old women with long ciga
rettes dangling from their lips. Hmm....
maybe the Holiday Inn is hiring.
Willing and Able is Princes attempt 
at gaining respect from the Doobie 
Brothers. He dabbles with bluesy gui
tar and sounds distinctly more female 
than Tina Turner singing River Deep, 
Mountain High with ex-hubby Ike.
The love songs found on the album 
are below caliber. The title track sounds 
like it should have been sung by James 
Ingram or Pebbles. The lyrics to Insa
tiable contain too much sexual content 
to be romantic. Like a wildcat in a 
celibate rage, I want u alone in my dirty 
little cage are certainly not appropri
ate for those tender emotional moments
 except maybe during a dinner date 
at McDonalds.
Although Diamonds and Pearls is a 
failure in showing Princes musical 
growth, it highlights his basic music 
capabilities incredibly well. The first 
track Thunder has a lot of kick-ass 
bass beat with electric guitar and a hint 
of Arabic flavor. There is a haunting 
backup chorus that strengthens the 
piece even more. Princes singing style 
on this track is similar to the one he
1991 Warner Bros. Records
used on When Doves Cry. Push is 
also ear-pleasing with its rap/dance 
style, full of Princes trademark ener
getic shrieking. (Granted, the shrieks 
arent as good as they were in Kiss.) 
Cream displays Princes proficiency 
in merging a female orgasmic moan 
with a driving synthesizer and key
board beat. The lyrics, of course, are as 
sexual as those he wrote for Sheena 
Eastons hit, Sugar Walls. Youvegot 
the horn so why dont you blow it?
Obviously, the horn represents themale 
anatomy being put in a compromising^ 
position,
The one song to top all other sexual 
Prince songs is^Gett Off. In fact, it setsa new precedent for sexual songs (takethat, Madonna!). The song begins withthe sound of a flute and a basic drum 
beat. Prince then begins to steam upbathroom windows with his sensual 
voice and explicit lyrics. The gyration 
of the pelvic region instinctively beginsat the sounds of we can do it in the 
kitchen on the floor, in the bathroom 
standing on the tub and holding on the 
rod.... Whew!
Despite his misfortune in working 
with different forms of music, Prince: 
has not ruined his reputation. His past : 
albums will always be recognized for: 
their distinct style, and the CD singles : 
of highlights ofi Diamonds and Pearls . 
will probably sell well. But someore 
should give Prince a little advice for the :

THE LAUGH TRACK
by A. Franklin Wheeler
Even Nick at Nite, once a safe 
place for ancient TV fare, is 
modernizing. Shows from the 
late sixties, including Get Smart, 
Dragnet, and Green Acres, domi
nate the cable networks 
primetime schedule, while 
former stars Donna Reed, Patty 
Duke, andDobie Gillis have been 
relegated to latenight hours. 
Mork & Mindy, a show origi
nally broadcast in the late sev
enties, is now able to find a spot 
on the schedule.
Nick at Nite has even can
celled some of its veterans. Be
witched left the schedule sev
eral months ago, and in October
 a few short weeks before 
McMurrays death  Nick at 
Nite bid My Three Sons a fond 
farewell with a 7-hour tribute. 
Coincidence? Well, yeah, prob
ably, but thats not the point.
The point is that the sitcoms 
our parents grew up watching, 
and we grew up rewatching, may 
disappear from the airwaves for
ever.
There is no doubt that this 
prospect probably pleases some 
people immensely. Old sitcoms, 
they argue, are hopelessly out
dated and possibly harmful in 
todays world. Almost every one 
of them relies on a cultural fan
tasy  the American family. 
Mom, Dad, and two or three kids
 always white, Christian, and 
middle class. The stereotypes 
these shows uphold could be 
downright dangerous.
I have to agree with the basis 
of this argument. Most of the 
shows in question are nothing
but fantasy. Take My Three 
Sons. This was the white-bread 
family with a twist: there was no 
mom. Still, there was a pseudomom in grufiy old Bub (and, 
later, Uncle Charley).
The rest of the family was stan
dard sitcom fare. The Douglases, 
consisting of a hard-working fa
ther, three rambunctious sons 
(hence the title), and the obliga
tory dog, resided in upper 
middle-class splendor some
where in the Midwest. The plots 
were nothing new even back 
then: oldest son Mike learning 
to drive and denting Dads car; 
middle son Robbie falling head 
over heels for the girl next door; 
youngest son Chip overcoming 
his fear of the dark.
Thats about as wild as things 
got in the Douglas household. 
Though Steve Douglas was sup
posed to be a widower, his late 
wife was never spoken of  af
ter all, such talk would be much 
too depressing! No one on this
show died. When actor William 
Frawley passed away in 1965, 
Bub suddenly moved to Alaska, 
and Uncle Charley joined the 
household.
In the world of My Three Sons, 
race did not exist. Everyones 
skin was the same shade, and 
everyone was happily ignorant. 
In this world, men worked and 
women cooked. For all three sons 
(plus adopted son Ernie), roman
tic courtships led eventually to 
marriage, which in turn led to 
children (with sex presumably 
somewhere in between).
For twelve years the Douglases 
aged but remained remarkably 
the same. When Mike, the old
est son, grew too old to be consid
ered a kid, he married and left, 
never to be heard from again. As 
luck would have it, Chips friend 
Ernie was an orphan looking for 
a home. Thus the three sons 
remained intact.
Granted, by the twelfth sea
son, the show looked more like
My Three Sons, Their Wives' 
and Children, My New Wife and; 
Stepdaughter, My Uncle 
Charley, and My Second Cousin 
Elmo Once Removed. The cast 
was enormous, but the stories 
never changed. The sons were 
now adults with their own kids,- 
who had familiar problems!- 
Robbie and his wife even had 
triplets, assuring the continuedlegitimacy of the title for years 
to come.
Fantasy? Sure. DreamlancJ?- 
Definitely. Sexist? Certainement. Racist? Undoubtedly. V 
Nightmare? Not necessarily, 
My Three Sons is not realistic. 
It never was. Its a fantasy 
through and through, and it 
should not be taken seriously. 
The Douglas family was nor
mal only on TV; no one in the 
real world ever had lives ao 
simple, straightforward, and 
trouble-free.

Joe Bob relives his sexual discrimination experience
When I was a cub reporter, 19 
or 20 years old, working for fe
male editors in Little Rock and 
Philadelphia and New York and 
Nashville, I used to dream about 
being sexually harassed. Of 
course, I didnt know how to spell 
harassed at the time, so what 
I was really dreaming about was 
being sexually anythinged.
- There were veteran reporters 
who told stories about the 
-woman who was fired for sleep
ing with her sources, like they 
were telling me, If the opportu
nity comes up, dont even think 
about it. So, of course, I thought 
about it all the time. I thought, 
Today itll happen. Ill go out to 
the Municipal Waste Manage
ment Bureau to interview the 
Director of SoUd Waste Disposal, 
and when I walk in it will be this 
sexually-starved dark-haired

Well, you know.
- .But I never thought I was in 
danger. I never thought that 
some editor and I would go off to 
make the sign of the triple-gilled 
aardvark and then six months 
later she would decide I was a 
jerk and send me off to cover 
traffic courts in South Jersey. 
Im sure it could have happened, 
but I didnt worry about it.
But lets look at what Anita 
Hill is claiming here. She says 
tliat Clarence made some crude 
remarks, pressured her for a

date, tried to get her to talk 
about porno movies, and, be
cause of that, she felt in fear for 
her job. She didnt feel enough in 
fearforherjob to complain about 
it. And when she was asked 
about that, she says there were 
two reasons: 1) she was young, 
and 2) there was a discrepancy 
in power. Clarence had more of 
it.
To which I say: 1) Eighteen is 
a grown-up, sweetie. 2) Weve 
got a word for people who he and 
cover up and withhold their real 
feelings because of fear for my 
job. Its called coward.
But even if Anita got proposi
tioned, breathed on, harassed, 
and forced to listen to Clarences 
drive-in movie reviews, she could 
have done the same thing I did 
with... well, well call her Shirley 
Lungs Sistrunk.
Shirley came on strong to me, 
and I didnt want any of it She 
was an editor. I was a (very 
young) reporter. She had the 
power. I didnt. She sent notes to
my office mailbox. We had lunch 
a couple of times. She said the 
right things. I was considering 
it ... but I never went through 
with it.
Why? Well, if I thought of life 
like Anita Hill, then I would say 
I didnt go through with it be
cause it was too dangerous for 
my career, or it was an abuse of 
Shirleys power, or it was too 
crude for this older woman to be 
making a pass at a young naive 
guy. But it wasnt any of those 
things.
I never touched Shirley 
Sistrunk because one day, while 
we were eating lunch, she got a 
piece of sandwich lodged be
tween her front teeth and con
tinued to talk to me like that for 
about twenty minutes. I couldnt 
get image out of my mind for 
days. And when youre 19 years 
old, stuff like that really counts.
When Shirley continued to 
press me, and quiet suggestions 
didnt help, I finally told her one 
day: I would do it, but I find you 
physically unattractive.
This did the trick. It was the 
last conversationl ever had with 
Shirley.
I guess people are gonna say, 
Well, see there, you could have 
lost your job for doing something 
like that.
Thats right. There are more 
important things than jobs.
Anita could have found the 
right thing to say to Clarence.
Lets look at what really hap
pened. She was too chicken to 
say it.

do disgusting things in public, 
Traci Lords is back again, still

happens to every sex symbol once 
they get a leading role? Thats

her clothes off for the camera! Do 
you hear what Im saying? This

the excitement with which this 
new information entered my life. 
Gangsters wore hats and drove 
big cars. Gangsters had tommy 
guns ... which they kept in vio
lent cases. Thus a young childs 
imagination is ignited, and the 
story called Violent Cases is bom. 
' This British graphic novel, 
available in its American edi

the tale of a young boy who 
thinks his doctor is A1 Capones

Ae main character after he has

two powerhouses behind this 
impressive new project.

COMIC RELIEF
by Waseem Hussain
McKeans work on the book as 
an effort to create a comic for 
people who didnt read comics; 
something with no super-heroes, 
no science fiction, no overt genre 
elements; something we could 
show our friends, and that our 
friends would read, and, if we 
were lucky, respect. Indeed, 
Gaiman and McKean have eas
ily succeeded in doing so.
The power of Violent Cases 
lies in its amazing ability to draw 
upon a universal subconscious. 
Remember the first birthday 
party you went to; remember 
the games, the shock of meeting 
another kids parents? The fear 
that you would be left in this 
strangers house, making the call 
to your mom to tell her to pick 
you up, waiting alone in the liv
ing room, staring at their family 
portraits, the cold momentum of 
an expanding world as the real
ization of the smallness of your 
existence descended upon you? 
Whats the attraction in reading 
stuff like that? Is it a vanity 
rash when you find a piece of 
common ground in the univer
sal subconscious? Property val
ues are soaring in the mental 
real estate business. Ah, comAn osteopath swigs down a drink In Violent Cases.
mon ground, what an invalu
able asset! Look at the popular
ity ofPulitzer Prize winner Anne 
Tyler (of Accidental Tourist and 
Breathing Lessons fame) or the 
successful run of the Cosby 
Show. Artists who manage to 
capture the elusive fragments of 
normal human life in their works 
of art are often successful art
ists. Gaiman and McKean are 
no exception to this usually con
stant ideal.
But you must remember that 
this is not a charming piece of 
fiction by Anne Tyler or Bill 
Cosby; this is material from the 
masters of unreality. The Won
der Years nostalgia is skewed
and artfully mangled by the pre
natal Sandmanesque influences. 
The storys plot climaxes when 
the dark moody underworld im
ages of the child and his ultra
normal reminiscing finally con
verge, creating a sumptuous ef
fect that is uniquely Neil 
Gaiman. It is an effect whose 
punch can only be delivered 
through the wildly impression
istic style of painter McKean.
The message of Violent Cases? 
Perhaps it is a glorification of 
innocence and imagination, for 
it is only through the eyes of the 
young that a virtual reality can 
be understood. Yet it is an un
derstanding that is dreamlike,
destined to disintegration as our 
minds become tainted and rigid 
from habit and convention. Vio
lent Cases mourns the loss of the 
honest eyes that we all saw 
through when we were young. It 
is a tragic commentary on the 
loss of truth that one can never 
recapture, yet a poignant appre
ciation of the power of imagina
tion that we all possess no mat
ter how old we get. In this way, 
Violent Cases can be very bitter
sweet to the palate. Look for it 
on menus next time youre out
dining, wont you?

The Nasty Girl
In the past weve learned about World War II in 
history classes by reading textbooks and docu
ments, and by watching endless amounts of film 
footage. And weve almost always seen it through 
the American perspective.
The Nasty Girl, based on a true stoiy, tells 
about an adolescent girl living in a small German 
town during the 1940s. She is disgusted with the 
internal and external conflicts in which her coun
try is involved and decides to write an essay about 
it at school. Of course her views are not readily 
accepted; she is shunned by her nationalistic 
friends and neighbors. According to the woman on 
whose life story the film is based, the town still 
refuses to have anything to do with her.
For an interesting viewpoint on World War II, 
The Nasty Girl offers something refreshing.

Out For Justice
Karate guru Steven Seagal is up to his old tricks
 beating up people in really neat ways  only 
this time hes after his old childhood buddy (Wil
liam Forsythe). Filled with roundhouse kicks, 
flyingbodies, powerful punches, broken glass, lots 
of blood, and really bad dialogue, Out For Justice 
sounds like it should be your average karate 
movie. However, Seagals above average acting 
and great onscreen persona make this a very 
enjoyable film about death and destruction.
So turnoff those brain cells of yours for a couple 
of hours and witness some needless violence. 
Youll thank yourself in the morning.

Robin Hood: 
Prince of Thieves
If you want to watch a film that has great 
action, uneven acting, and lots of characters which 
just happen to have the same names as those from 
The Legend of Robin Hood (the story has nothing 
whatsoever to do with the original), then Robin 
Hood: Prince of Thieves is the movie for you.
Loosely based (very loosely) on the original tale, 
Robin Hood stars a very American Kevin Costner 
who is easily upstaged by almost every other 
actor. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio plays a twentieth-century* Maid Marian, Morgan Freeman 
plays a very colorful Moor who owes his life to 
Robin, and Alan Rickman (of Die Hard fame) 
plays the evil Sheriff of Nottingham. Rickman 
steals the entire film with his off-the-wall acting.
If you can make it past the lumpy first hour and 
Costners California accent, you will then be re
warded with enough action and adventure to fill 
three films. Youll even get to see Sean Connery as 
King Richard (for almost a whole minute) at the 
very end. But classic Robin Hood fans, be fore
warned  you will be disappointed with this 
picture.

The Long Walk Home
In the past, American society has discrimi
nated against several different groups. For ex
ample, in the mid 1950s, blacks and women were 
beginning to realize that they had very few rights.
The Long Walk Home deals with the beginnings 
of the civil rights and feminist movements. Nar
rated by Mary Steenburgen, the movie tells the 
story of a southern woman (Sissy Spacek) well set 
m society and her relationship with her house
keeper (Whoopi Goldberg). The relationship be
tween the two changes dramatically throughout 
the film. Seeing the two women reevaluate their 
lives through intelligent and structured dialogue 
is impressivetopics such as the civil rights and 
feminist movements are hard to handle.
The film is both touching and educational, and 
certainly worth the dollar. Dont miss it.

GLICKER
CFA prepares for the opening of King Stag
By ELIZABETH CHAMBERS
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Once upon a time there were 
13 senior drama students who 
lived in the kingdom of Carnegie 
Mellon. They rehearsed night 
and day to make a fairy tale 
come to life. The fairy tale, King 
Stag, opens at Kresge Theatre 
on November 16. Under the di
rection of Larry Arrick, who is 
renowned for his work with stu
dents from Yale and stars such 
as George C. Scott and Mario 
Thomas, these students will tell 
a fantastic tale of kings, prin
cesses, evil villains, true love, 
and magic.
King Stag tells the story of 
King Deramo (Walter Elder), 
who is in search of an heir. He 
uses the spells given to him by 
the powerful magician 
Durandarte (Eric Jensen) to find 
the perfect wife. After he chooses 
a wife, people in the kingdom 
who disagree with his decision 
do all they can to foil his ro
mance.
The magic of the production 
does not lie solely in the script 
it lies in the people involved in 
all aspects of the show.
Its all about the relationship 
between the director and the 
actor. I dont have to just sit

mation about tickets call x2407.
back and follow direction. Ive 
gotten the opportunity to offer 
suggestion. It came to the point 
where he [Arrick] would say, I 
need this, this, and this in this 
space. Fill it,  said Mike Fuller, 
whose role as a puppeteer in
volves a close working relation
ship with fellow puppeteer Mike 
Lucas. During portions of the 
show, they work in unison.
When youre acting out lines, 
you can fake it. But when Mike 
[Lucas] and I arent connected, 
we cant fake it. This is an acid 
test for us, and if we arent to
gether, it doesnt work.
King Stag has been an experi
ence for everyone involved. It 
has been weeks of long hours 
and hard work which make up 
what Jensen explains as learn
ing what professionalism is. He 
[Arrick] expects us to be profes
sional and we [the cast] want to 
give it to him.
In order to show the work in
volved in putting the magic into
King Stag, it is necessary to take 
a sneak peek at a past re
hearsal....
Last Wednesday nights re
hearsal in Margaret Morrison 
was one of the last preparatory 
rehearsals before moving the 
whole production to the Kresge. 
There had been a full cast re
hearsal since 3 pm. Various 
members of the cast paced across 
the stage, reciting lines. Jeffrey 
Shore worked with his cane, 
Kelly Bertrand stretched, and 
Terry Lee, the stage manager, 
tossed Nestle Crunch bars to 
some of the actors. Arrick was 
sitting down, looking over notes. 
He looked up at the actors be
fore speaking.
Let me see if we have enough 
to make this work, said Arrick, 
as the actors moved into their 
opening positions. The opening 
scene, with its modified prayer 
Smile on Us, calling for the 
patrons and gods of the theatre 
to bless the production, was run 
through. Arrick approved.
Lee called out from the table 
as the cast returned to their 
places. OK, were going through 
Act one. Get used to this. Is 
everyone ready? There was 
some shuffling behind the stage 
followed by an eerie silence. Im 
going.
A few hours later, after both 
acts were run through smoothly, 
the cast took a ten minute break. 
Brent Lowe and Elder sat on  
chairs outside the rehearsal 
room, while other cast members 
headed towards the water foun
tain.
When we first started this 
show, says Lowe, we were play
ing it as comedy and we realized 
we couldnt pull it off unless we 
took comedy seriously. Comedy 
should be taken seriously.
Elder laughed, Thats where 
the humor comes from. A lot of 
things that happen in this show 
arent done. This is the first shdw 
Ive been inhere [at CMU] where 
actors went through so many 
transformations. It asks a lot of 
the audience. I like that we have 
a director who trusts, and be
lieves we can pull it off. The only 
limits are the ones we put on 
ourselves....
Although the script of King 
Stag is full of its own magic and 
endings, the people involved 
have created their own fairy tale; 
which will end after long re
hearsals followed by two weeks 
of performance from November 
16 to December 7. When th 
curtain falls on the last perfor
mance, once upon a time will 
become happily ever after.
My Three Sons exemplifies the perfect TV family
SONS, from page LAI
broadcast from 1960-1972. The 
sixties, folks. Race riots. Peace 
marches. Woodstock. Yet we 
would never expect to see Chip 
burning his draft card, Steve 
taking partin a one-night stand, 
Ernie contemplating suicide, or 
Robbie exploring his own sexu
ality. My Three Sons was never 
topical.
My Three Sons was someones 
dream of the way the world 
should be. Its not everyones 
dream, and its certainly not my 
dream.
Yet I gain pleasure from My 
Three Sons, for three reasons. 
First, as a parody. Lets face it, 
the situations in My Three Sons 
ranged from ridiculous to down
right boring. At times, the 
Douglases really had to go out of 
their way to avoid controversy. 
In a way, the incessant happi
ness and triviality of their lives 
called attention to the things 
never mentioned, lampooning 
the stereotypical images that the 
show was trying to uphold.
In my opinion, old shows like 
My Three Sons are less harmful
than current shows like Full 
House or Charles in Charge. All 
of them attempt to brainwash 
the viewer, but the attempt of 
My Three Sons is not nearly as 
well disguised.
Second, as art. This show did 
what it did quite well. The cast, 
from Fred McMurray as good ol 
dad and William Frawley as lov
able Bub right on down to be
spectacled Ernie, turned in toprate performances every week 
that made what could have been 
a mediocre show memorable.
Third, as an escape. My Three 
Sons is so far divorced from real
ity that I can sit back, zone out, 
and escape into a fantasy world. 
Reality can be depressing at 
times. Who among us hasnt at 
least once longed to be in a 
simple, trouble-free, unambigu
ous, non-hateful worldatleast 
for a little while? For a halfhour, we can be. But once the 
shows over, its back to reality.
Do I want to be a member of 
the Douglas family? Of course 
not. Their little mindless world 
might be nice to visit periodi
cally, but I wouldnt want to live
there. It wouldnt work out; you 
see, I couldnt force my reality 
on them any more than they 
could force their narrow sitcom 
worldview on me.
As far as Im concerned, old 
TV is good TV. A half-hour with 
the Douglases is thirty minutes 
well-spent. Laughing with Lucy 
is fun and worry-free. Watching 
Father Knows Best and Donna 
Reed back-to-back does not make 
me feel the least bit guilty.
I guess Im in a minority. Old 
sitcoms seem to be going out of 
style, whether I like it or not. A 
few years down the road, 
M*A*S*H will be considered 
ancient history, and My Three
Sons will be long forgotten. There 
will be no place left for the clas
sics from the fifties and sixties.
Its a sad thought, but likely 
inevitable. I, however, refuse.to 
let these shows die along with 
the actors and actresses who 
made them famous. As long as 
theres videotape, I will have a 
record of TVs past. I already 
have fourteen episodes of My 
Three Sons on tape, and they 
might just be the only ones I 
or anyone else  will see for 
quite some time.
