Special Performance For

On Nov. 18
PLOT OF PILLARS 
IS MELODRAMATIC
Production Will Be Under 
Direction Of Professor 
E. W. Hickman
By ROY MINET
The second Little Theater production, Henrik Ibsens The Pillars of Society under the direction of Professor E; W. Hickman, will open Friday evening. Six evening 
performances will be given through to November 17, with a matinee at 3:30 on .Friday, November 18. A 
special performance for alumni will be given on the evening of November 18 as a part of the annual Alumni Homecoming program.
The Pillars of Society is one of Ibsens early plays, written 
while he was under the influence of Scribe, the inventor of the wellmade play. The plot, therefore, is : melodramatic, and many scenes are effectively theatrical, especially 
according to the older ideas of good theater; but the germ of almost all of the ideas that are the warp and woof of Ibsens later plays can be found in Pillars.A splendid introduction to the whole of Ibsen drama is provided 
by The Pillars of Society, because it pictures the kind of community in which the Norwegian 
dramatist placed the action of the bulk of his plays, and because it shows the narrow mindedness of , the petty bourgeoisie, their hypocrisy. their constant gossiping, and 
their compromise with truth and integrity which had the rasping effect on Ibsen that drove him to 
become an enemy of social conventions.
The cast of players is as follows: (Continued on Page Three)
Changed Point 
System Adopted 
For Activities
Important changes have been 
made in the Womens Activities 
Point System in a revised rating 
of campus activities made by the 
active Mortar Board chapter and 
Student Council with Hazel Gough 
33, Margaret Morrison, chairman 
of the committee, in charge.
Several offices which were not 
considered important enough for 
first or second class have been 
rerated.
A ruling was also made that the 
names of all nominees for offices 
must be filed with the chairman of 
the Womens Activities Point Sys
tem before an election is held. 
This requirement was made so that the eligibility of candidates may be checked before the election.. 
The results of all elections must also be filed with the chairman of the committee.
The classification of activities as it appears in the Student Handbook for this year is a copy of the 
old rating. The revised rating separates all activities into five classes. Major changes in each group are-indicated by asterisks.

Group Organized 
To Aid Stewards
A new organization, the Stewards Guild, which is composed of the managers of the various campus social fraternities, has recently been formed.
The purpose of the Guild is to instruct new stewards in their work so that the highest efficiency will be developed in the least amount of time; and to create a co-operative buying group so that a saving can be made on purchases by wholesale buying.It is the opinion of the more experienced stewards that great savings can be made by pooling the buying resources of the various fraternities. This will be especially true because of Carnegies location in a highly competitive district. Similar co-operative buying organizations have been in operation in other schools for years.The officers of the Stewards Guild are: Stuart J. Meyers, Kappa Delta Rho, president; Harold B. Pressman, Beta Sigma Rho, treasurer; and William H. Reed, Phi Kappa, secretary.

By ANNA E. LADD
The annual Welfare Drive, the 
only charity drive sponsored by 
Student Council, Will officially open on the campus tomorrow and continue until November 23. Thiscampaign, which takes the place of the usual Y. M. & W.. C. A. drives, was inaugurated at Carnegie last year and was placed under the direction of Student Council.Although no quota has been set for tyie school this year, the committee in charge hopes to realize a contribution of one dollar from each student. This year those men who contribute this unofficial quota of one dollar will receive, upon presentment of his receipt at the Y office, a membership card to the Y. M. C. A. which entitles him to the full privileges of his membership.If any student feels, however, that he cannot donate this amount, any contribution that lie wishes to give will be taken. A card bearing the students name will be in the hands of class representatives who have been appointed to take charge of their respective sections in all divisions of the school. These cards will be marked off with sections in which tne amount of the contribution may be placed. The card will also include a detachable receipt which will be given to the contributor upon receipt of his donation. If the student finds that he would like to contribute but has not the necessary money at the time, he may pledge his donation by signifying it on the card and signing his name. The receipt will be given him on payment of his pledge.The money collected will be distributed to seventy different charitable agencies in the Pittsburgh district without regard for race or religion. The Carnegie Y. M. & W. C. A. will also receive a share of this money for use in its relief work.
The committee urges those who contribute to wear the feathers which will be distributed by the class representatives when the student offers liis donation.
In case some are overlooked by the solicitors they may present their .contributions at the Y office to Mr. Davis.
Dr. E. Fellows 
Will Lecture On 
English Madrigal
Dr. Edmund Ii. Fellows, prominent English musical authority, will deliver a lecture on the English Madrigal Friday,. November 18, at Carnegie Lecture I-Iali. I-Iis appearance in Pittsburgh is spon-. sored jointly by Phi Mu Alpha, the mens musical honorary, and Sigma Alpha Iota, the womens musical honorary.
The recent revival of interest in early song forms, as the madrigal and carol, in England, Germany, and America has been largely due to Dr. Fellows. He has done much work and research in connection with the madrigal of the Elizabethan and Jacobean epochs of English history and has become the foremost living authority on that branch of musical knowledge.Dr. Fellows has been an important figure in English musical society. He has received the degrees of bachelor of music from Oxford University and doctor of music from Dublin University. Formerly he held the position of director of the Choir in St. Georges Chapel in Windsor Castle.
His lecture here is to be illustrated either by the Carnegie Madrigal Choir or by records that have -been made under his personal direction. The singing in these records has been done by the Choir of St. Georges Chapel or by the English Singers.This will be Dr. Fellows second lecture sponsored by a Carnegie organization. I-Ie spoke here in 1927.

Tournaments of all kinds seem 
to draw the spot-light for the com

the list of special events. The 
freshmen have enough playerson their squad to challenge all of the upperclass teams at once, so beware of them in the coming matches. As yet the champion freshman team has not been announced, but there are rumors about a certain group who play together at every practice. The intra-class games which are scheduled for Tuesday and Thursday will decide the victors.
Pitt has invited twelve Carnegie girls to compete in a Hockey PlayDay on one of their hills this coining Saturday. P. C. W. and Duquesne have also been invited, but we are placing all our bets on - le Tartans. Carnegie won both gar as last year. Can we repeat?
The archery tournament for all who have made a score of ninety or above started last Friday. There ought to be some more points 
awarded soon.While we are speaking of awards, let us say that the totals of indijvidual athletic points are posted on the W. A. A. Bulletin Board m Margaret Morrison.

A new name will appear in the Carnegie athletic record books next Saturday after our Tartans journey to Cincinnati and meet Xavier University of that city. Although the contest falls in the warm-up class, Carnegie does not intend to take it too lightly or the 
strong little squad from Cincy might upset some dope. However, if things fare as expected, the Tartan reserves who have so far this season had little opportunity to show their wares, should break into the lineup and aid in the scoring.
Xavier Record Just Fair
Xavier, while not sporting such 
an enviable record thus far this season, is gaining in strength and experience every week and expects to reach its peak Saturday against the Skibos. The Musketeers started off their current schedule 
by registering two wins. The first victim was Transylvania, 46-0 and 
then Centre fell by a 7-0 score. Since then things have not gone so well for Xavier, footballically speaking. Oglethorpe (who bowed to Duquesne) and Dayton Univer
sity both dumped the Musketeers by 7-0 counts. W. and J. ran up a 34-0 score in Cincy but last week Xavier started on the comeback road by holding Loyola of New Orleans to a 6-6 tie.Reports from Cincinnati contend that W. and Js 3s-0 victory was no 
true indication of Xaviers strength as the Presidents gained two of their touchdowns after intercepting passes, two via their own aerial attack and one on a long 
run. Also, only once did W. and J. register two first downs in a row which is quite a tribute to the defensive qualities of the Musketeer line.The Xavier footballers had an open date last week and are making no secret of the fact that they are pointing for the Carnegie game. It is the hope of the Ohioans to catch the Plaid players when the minds of the latter are directed toward the coming Pitt contest. This fact, coupled with usual fighting and psychological ad
vantages held by the underdog, may combine to give the Skibos a harder game than expected.Temple Game Showed Tartans ImprovedThe two-day layoff which Bob Waddell gave his boys after the
Student tickets for the Carnegie Tech-PItt football game must bo exchanged at the AthIctic office this week. The days for exchange arc as follows: Upperclassmen, Monday and Tuesday; Freshmen, Wednesday and Thursday. The students are asked to please observe these dates and exchange tickets at the proper times.
Graduate Manager of Athletics, Mr. Overend, wishes it to be announced that the GridGraph will be in operation for the Xavier football game this Saturday afternoon. As usual, there will be no charge for students as they will be admitted on their student books. The admission for outsiders will be twenty-five cents.
RED GRANGE, THE GALLOPING GHOST FROM ILLINOIS who wore 
that famous number "77" jcroey, and who several years back startled 
the football world by scoring four touchdowns in less than fifteen min
utes against Michigan, Is once more stepping high, wide and handsome 
upon the gridiron. For the past few years the Illinois Iceman has 
been playing professional football and this year, with the Chicago 
Bears, he io doing mighty well for the professional game. In addi
tion to toting that pigskin, Mr. Grange has become a sports writer 
and several of his articles have appeared in the Saturday Evening 
Post. Probably the most interesting part of his last story was his 
statement upon the manner In which tholr practice periods arc spent. The Pro's practice five days a week and most of the two to threehour drill sessions are spent In the practicing of FUNDAMENTALS. Charging, blocking, and tackling are stressed the most. Many college coaches think that these things should be learned in high school or prep school. It seems strange that a team composed of some of the best college players in the country should stoop so low as to drill upon these menial things. Perhaps the Red Head" doesnt know what he is talking about as he has been playing organized football 
for only fourteen years.
HAVING HAD TWO WEEKS OF REST SINCE THE LAST GAME, the Tartan footballers are raring to get at that Xavier team In Cincinnati tliis Saturday afternoon. For the first time since the WashJeff game the team will go on to the field with no injured mates on the sidelines with the possible exception of Tesser, who may be held out of the lineup until the Pitt game. The Plaid team should show 
better form ih this game than at any time this season. In the Temple contest they showed a definite improvement over that displayed in earlier games, and in the scrimmage session on Thursday they went about their duties in a manner seen but few.times so far this year. Although Xavier is not considered Btrong they should give the Tartans a chance to polish up on a few new plays and improve the running attack for the Pitt game next week. Xavier has a good defensive team this year despite the fact that W. & .T. defeated them 34-0. Most of the W. & J.s touchdowns were scored on intercepted passes or passes of their own. So stubborn was the resistance on line plays that tho strong Red and Black team did not score two first downs in succession at any time during tho game. This game should be just what is needed to put the team on edge for the Pitt contest on November 19.
Wash-Jeff Scores First 
Blanckes Run Of 
75 Yards
Temple game seemed to be just both individually and as a team,, the right tonic as Wednesdays was by far the best Carnegie has drill was marked by a spirit and thus far exhibited in this carndash which has not been seen paign.since pre-season practices. After So while it will be well nigh imThursdays scrimmage, Bobs face possible for the Tartan players towore a broad smile which would keep the Pitt game from their seem to indicate that our Tartans minds this week and when they are rounding into shape and will face Xavier Saturday, nevertheless be up there for that all-importthe contest with the Ohioans can ant game next week. It is no senot be taken lightly. So much decret that the Plaid team functioned pends upon the manner in which smoother in the Temple game than the Plaid, machine is groomed and at any other time this season. The polished down there in Cincinnati blocking was cleaner, the tackling that a slip-up at this juncturefiercer and the play in general, would be disastrous.
The plebes of Carnegie Tech and Wash-Jeff put on a real thriller down in the Carnegie Bowl last Saturday morn. The score was a 6-6 deadlock, but the sixty minutes of play was jammed full of thrills, even though it was played in a pile 
of mud.The first cause for excitement came early in the second quarter when Blanch, a flashy Prexy back, 
slipped around left end for 80 yards and a touchdown. Just before the half ended, the big red team again threatened when 
Perkins broke away and was thrown out of bounds on the twoyard stripe as the whistle blew.The Tartan plebes reversed the order of things in the second half. Owen Bowser, star halfback, ran back to his three-yard line to recover a long W. and J. punt and then proceeded to slip through the entire field for 97 yards, tying the score. Both teams failed to con
vert the extra point.The plebes were supposed to end their season with the Presidents, but it is likely that they may yet play a cancelled game with Kiski. Definite arrangements have not been made as yet.All in all, it has been a lean year for the Skibo yearlings, but considering the lack of material, injuries, and bad breaks in general, they have made a creditable showing.
Hannum Calls

For Practice
Westminster 
Defeated By 
Tech Harriers
Cross-Country Team 
Scores Easy Win By 
15-40 Score
The Camogle Tech Harriers 
easily defeated WeBtminBter last 
Saturday In Schenley Park by the 
perfect score of 15-40. The Tar* 
tans were able to place ten men 
before Westminster crossed the 
finish line making it the most de
cisive victory for the Plaid in sev
eral years. After an early season 
defeat, the Tartans have chalked 
up two victories in the last few 
weeks.
Although Carnegie placed the first 
ten men only the first five count 
on the score. They were Allan, 
Schell, Stankey, Burke, and Netzer; 
Westminster finished with Wavor, Gerstner, Snyder, Needham, and 
Bowers.
Next Saturday the Tartans 
travel to Morgantown to meet the Mountaineers on their own tough course. Last year the West Virginians chalked up a win over a 
strong Carnegie team and' they are figuring on repeating this year. 
The Tartans are figuring the other way so it will be a close race.The Plebes continued in their losing ways by dropping two meets to their opponents last week. On Tuesday the Peabody runners took them over and the same process was repeated by Taylor Allderdice on Friday. However Garrlety did some good running including a first placo on Friday. He was chosen captain following tho Peabody 
moot.
Fergus And Jagnow Are 
Missing From First 
Practice Session
Max Hannums promising squad 
of courtmen has had its ranks ma
terially reduced in the last few 
weeks. Co-captain Red Fer
gus, probably the finest guard ever 
to play basketball at Carnegie, and 
Lou Jagnow, this sections most 
outstanding forward last season, have been lost to the squad at least two months as a result of serious operations on their knees.Jagnow injured his leg in a base
ball game last spring, and it was thought that an early operation would prevent more trouble later on when the Toledo flash will be sorely needed. Fergus injured his 
knee in football practice this fall, bringing his gridiron ambitions to an early close. He was operated on Saturday at the Allegheny General hospital.The squad has been working out for the last three weeks, mostly in 
the open, and Coach Hannum is confident that his powerful outfit 
will be district champs this time. An influenza .epidemic ruined all such hopes last year.Among the basket flingers out for honors this year are Silverman, Stentz, Smith, Edelblut, Ewalt, Riggs, and Petransky. Several others will join the squad when football season runs its course.

Two of his mainstays for this years basketball team arc in the Allegheny General Hospital recovering from knee operations. Jagnow has been there for over a week, and Co-captain "Angus Foir-Gus left Saturday to have his trick knee fixed. It is hoped that both men will bo ready for the opening game on January 7, but even If they arc completely recovered they will have lost many weeks of valuable practice. Coach Hannum has been tearing his hair all week In his worry over the prospects for the coming season. Mr. Hannum would like to announce at thla time that all upperclassmen who intend to come out for varsity basketball should do so, Immediately.Jimmy Leonard, last year's captain, and at the present time coach of the Plcbc court team has been working on the Freshman squad during the past week.

No classes will be in session this Friday evening, November 11. This is the first holiday of the year for the night school and no doubt will be welcomed by the student body. Classes will resume as usual the following Monday evening.
DIDJA NOTICE
THAT despite the xtreme precautions taken, this person actually crashed the Industries Smoker, honest Injun.THAT the Goliaths that put on a wrestling exhibit seemed to have a fondness for each others toes.THAT there were less broad 
smiles after the election than before. Oh, well. Somebody 
bigger than us took it on the chin yesterday.THAT we arc to have our first taste of night school vacation this Friday.THAT some mighty hunters are preparing to leave on a hunting trip this week. We'll give you the low-down when they re
turn.THAT a night mud student (sculptor to you) visited the Industries school and forgot to take off his skirt before coming over.THAT we are going to put on our disguise and crash the Arts dance Saturday night.THAT we enjoyed the sight the other night of two big shots being given a good bawling out by a bigger shot.THAT the signs tell us that there will be no pumpkin pies for reckless guys, so be careful. THAT thats that, and Ill be 
seenya.
The first big dance of the Night 
Student Council will be held on 
November 25 in the gymnasium, 
auditorium. This will bo the Thanksgiving Week .Recess Dance which the council bolds annually.More details will be announced later concerning this dance as the arrangements are as yet not completed. The assessment to students will be one dollar per couple as heretofore on all council dances. Invitations will soon be available for distribution. Better make note' of the date, November 25 and plan to attend the frolic.
Since all three of the colleges have had their elections and the new officers have begun to get into the swing of things, we are 
now both surprised and pleased to notice that the beginning of the night school social year is, like the ever elusive prosperity, just around the corner. The College, of Fine Arts will start the ball rolling on November 12, when they 
hold their first dance of the year. Other activities will soon be giving the night students a chance to get away from the grind for a night now and then.
The new officers will be In need of men who are willing to assist 
in preparations for most of these affairs. The Night Student Council, especially, will need assistance 
in preparing for their dances the first of which will take place in the Gymnasium Auditorium on 
November 25. This will be the 
Thanksgiving Dance, which has been a great success in previous years.
The Council, as well as the 
school officers, can depend upon 
the former students to turn out and help, but that isnt enough. 
The co-operation of the new students is welcomed. Activities keys are awarded for meritorious work clone, as explained on page 37 of 
the handbook. Dont be bashful. Report to the council, or your 
school officers your willingness to aid, and they will give you your directions. Watch this page for notices calling for workers.
On October 2S, the Night College 
of Fine Arts held its annual elec
tion of officers. Mr. William R. 
Hodder, President of the Night 
Student Council was present at the 
election aiul gave a short and in
teresting talk on the work of the council. A number of students responded by turning in their names for working on the activities of the council.As the result of the election Martin B. I-Iudale was made President, Henry E. Schwartz, vice president; 
Andrew N. Evans, secretary; and Edward F. White, treasurer. These men have been active on the campus in the activities of the council as well as those of their own College.Plans were made immediately to shape up an interesting program for the coming year for Night Arts and the first function will be the dance which is scheduled for this Saturday evening._________________
Orchestra Selected For 
First Social Event 
Of New Season
Motion Pictures And The 
Kiltie Band Are The 
Big Attractions
There should be a holiday in the 
night school shortly, I sorta-felt it 
in my bones, so I looked up the so
cial registerguess I should have 
referred to it as the official holi
day list, but then who cares. It is 
a holiday I am after, and call it 
by whatever name you wish, No
vember eleventh is one of those 
things for the night students. No 
class on this evening. Bet some of the instructors are sore. It 
wrecks the possibility of a pesky 
quiz for them and that is something in their young life. Good thing I thought of looking or else 
there would be a big number of night students coming out on Friday. However, if you dont take 
my word for it ask your instructor and he will tell you.Elections, elections, elections, 
when are they going to stop. You look here and you hear of one, look 
there and you hear of another, and then you look somewhere else and still you hear of another election. Now it is the big fight. By 
the time this dope of mine is read some one will be in and some one will be out. Or some one will be out and someone will be in. Take it which every way you will. One says one thing and then by way of 
diversion some one else says another. Which one to believe is like an equation in chemistry or mechanics, if you will. They have me treed. But then I don't count for much.
Speaking of trees brings me to an absorbing topic just now. You dont know; well it was just like thisthere were three boats in an oar, and the oar leakedwhat was I .saying? Oh! why they are out bunting. Yes, some of the 
night students have gone hunting for nuts, and rabbits, and squirrels, and perhaps big game too. Hope none of them come back shot. It would spoil a perfectly good hunting season if they did. 
Wonder what it would be like to go hunting? I never did it so I cant imagine what it is like. The only thing I am able to hunt is one of these elusive logarithms which we have to play with so much in our math class.
Sure would be fine if we had a dance every night in the week instead of having to wait months for one. But then I shouldnt say anthing because !t won't be long until the first one will be scheduled for us. It appears to be during the Thanksgiving recess and this 
should afford us some time to enjoy^oursefves. We don't have a grea deal of time at our disposal I might, but when I say our, I 
am referring to those industrious night students who never, no never, take their eyes off their books. They dont even know there is a dance scheduled. They better 
wise up because they dont know what they are missing.
Everything is serene on the 
Wabash now. The shops seem to have new lights, the class rooms seem to be buzzing with in
dustry, the parking spaces are still at a premium, and the arts have enough paper napkins to dry their dirty hands. Well these are surely things to be thankful for. Glad to note that we have plenty of 
towels in the wash room. Somebody is surely on his toes. Thata-boy, you will have our support at any time for these blotting favors.
Have my ear to the ground, and my eye to the sky for some inside dope these days, out as yet I don't seem to be able to manage to come across. My predecessor seemed to have the happy faculty of grasping the dope from the air, but I have to gr >pe along as best I can and 
hope for nibbles from time to time. For me, it is just one long week 
after another. No sooner finished than I have to start on another trail, and the funy part of it is that these trails lead nowhere.Which brings me to signinq off with "So long until next weekThat was the Idle Night Student of Station PLAID who will return again next week at this same hour. The Tartan bids you all "Good Night.____________________________
Night Industries 
Smoker Crashed 
By Art Student
The Night College of Fine Arts will hold its first dance of the 
year on Saturday, November 12, in Thistle Hall. Tickets are now being distributed by the officers of that college. Every Arts student 
who has paid the night activities fee is entitled to attend this dance.
Little need be said about the popularity of these Night Arts 
dances. Former students look for. ward to them with keen pleasure. 
All new students are urged to attend and participate in one of the gayest affairs on the night campus.The committee in charge has secured the services of Bill Rose and his boys to furnish music for the occasion. Those students who danced to Bills orchestra at one of last years functions will be certainly pleased to 
hear this news. This orchestra 
is one of the finest to appear on the campus and is sure to add greatly to the success of the evening.The committee wishes to empha* size at this time that this dance is open only to night students of the 
Fine Arts school; no one else will be admitted. This rule will be strictly enforced.
This dance will provide an excellent means of meeting yourclassmates in a social way; so 
don't forget Saturday night in Thistle Hall from 9 until 12 p. m. Well be looking for you.
The smoker of the Night College 
of Industries was the last function 
to be held during the past few 
weeks by the individual colleges. 
This smoker is a semi-annual get 
together of the Night College of 
Industries and affords an opportunity to the men in this college of coming out and having a good time.Through the efforts of Mr. Samuel J. Nikhazy the college was fortunate to secure an exhibition of talking moving pictures showing the various types of instruments used in telephonic communication. The equipment was furnished by the Bell Telephone Company and the pictures were well portrayed. The presentation of the whole subject matter was interwoven in an interesting series of 
talking pictures.Our Kiltie band was out again to give the night industries men a big treat and those who were present certainly enjoyed the concert. These men seem to be imbued with the real spirit of enthusiasm and respond as one when called upon on any occasion.The college elected to office for the year, John F. Simpson, president; Chester S. Biscup, vice president; Cornelius A. Blocliinger, secretary, and Frank A. Kolsun, treasurer.A wrestling match and some boxing bouts furnished a very entertaining spectacle for those students who are interested in fistic contests. Many a tense moment was experienced by the audience.Refreshments were served at the close of the evening and the lunch was well received. Everybody left feeling that an enjoyable evening had been spent.
Did you know that Will Rogers is a co-ed? Girls at Wellesley re
cently elected him an honorary classmate. Lucky Will!__________
My desire to crash the first night industries smoker was as 
diabolical as my purpose was ambiguous. I had been cautioned that any attempt by a non-smoking 
effeminate art student to pass their sacred portals would invite disaster. At any rate, I succeeded in gaining entrance to their holy 
sanctum by disguising myself as the four Marx Brothers shadow.-As I marched triumphantly past the busy bouncers, whose annoying question, at least to me. "wheres your registration card? I had 
cleverly evaded, a very sinister force halted me in my tracks. It was my conviction that I was subject to a gas attack. My fears 
were soon allayed, however, when I realized that the deadly odor was really the pungent aroma of hundreds of seventy-five cent cigars.Entertainment is Good
One truly 'bright feature of the evening was the delightful music 
of the Kiltie Band. The claim of bad acoustics in the gymnasium became discounted as this famous unit rendered spirited and throbbing music.
The most exciting event was a wrestling match between two enormous bone crushers. Tho 
grunts and groans of these powerful adversaries as they rolled and twisted each other bodies into 
painful distortions were enough to thrill any lover of physical agony 
in others.Several boxing matches were also on, the program, and speaking 
in the winsome lingo of his calling, the announcer of fights referred to the various opponents as the Second Avenue Art or the Seventeenth Street Bum. The final brawl resulted in an imbroglio 
from which the referee emerged as the loser. It was finally settled 
after several eyes had been retired from sightseeing.
Guests Make a Raid on Food
When the signal to eat was given, there developed one of the most devastating raids on food 
that I have ever witnessed. I observed one contented diner holding five bottles of milk, a dozen sandwiches, and a half-peclc of apples besides a .generous share of pickles and olives. He devoured them as if fearing that vitamins A and X would freeze up in the next moment.
Aside from my constant trepidation, and the crumpling of certain 
illusions developed by the extrava-; gant exaggerations of evil persons conspiring to keep me away, I really had an enjoyable time. As a mat
ter of fact I have decided to expiate my errors by crashing the next smoker as an old timer. This form of masculine diversion has virtually swept me off my feet with enthusiasm.But there is nothing like a 
good old night arts dance for gayety and color. Sorry you cant be there. ______________

Now that the final returns are in, and even the late comers have had their noses recorded in the general count, it would seem that registration didnt get thrown for too bad a loss after all. Of course, the students who are able to get a seat on the inward bound street cars for the first time in years realize that there must have been a drop.
It is refreshing to note that such a large part of the old students are back again, and that their ranks have been reinforced by a healthy contingent of beginners. It is interesting to notice that the large majority of the old guard realizes that education is not like securities, and that its value is not affected by economic conditions. (Besides, its one of the few untaxable things left). While men, trained or otherwise, are not in great demand at present, the time will come when those who have had the foresight to keep on plugging at their studies will be just that much better prepared to take advantage of the upswing when it does arrive in the possibly near future. And as for the men who allowed present conditions to damp Mifnr ambitions, will their faces be red?

The Welfare Drive 
The Student Council is again appealing to the students to 
contribute to the Allegheny County Welfare Fund. Yesterday 
the drive on the canrpus got under way and will continue until 
November 23.
To many students it seems paradoxical that such a drive 
should be conducted on the campus this year, since many , of 
them arc finding it difficult to pay their, college expenses. 
But in reality, there is no time like the present when the stu
dents should be more willing to contribute to this very worth
while cause, regardless how.small the contribution might be.
The Welfare Budget for 1933 has been set at $2,480,160. 
This includes $300,000 for the Allegheny County Emergency As
sociation to meet emergency relief needs which cannot be pro
vided from public funds. A. bulletin issued by the Welfare 
Fund Committee,states that the budget of the fund'itself, in
cluding year round administration and campaign expense is 3.5 
per cent of this total.As a result of a survey of operating costs in family agen
cies handling unemployment relief, the Welfare Fund has 
reached the figure, corroborated by an independent study, of 
approximately 8 per cent as the administrative cost ol: hand
ling unemployment relief . . . With a deficit of some $260,000 
being carried forward, the Fund cannot incur any additional 
deficit during 1933, without facing the crisis of an actual cash 
shortage involving the borrowing of funds or the abandonment 
ol! programs . . .
The campus Y. M. C. A. operating funds for 1933 will be 
governed entirely by the total amount subscribed to the Wel
fare Drive throughout the county, since the Y Drive is a 
part of this drive. This is just one of the reasons why the stu
dents should feel that they arc contributing to a worthwhile 
cause. In times ol! depression, welfare organizations perform a 
service to humanity that is unparalleled by any other agency. 
The students should not feel that bocause their homes are not 
in Allegheny County they need not contribute, for they do live 
nine months out ol! every twelve in the county.
It is commendable that the Student Council should under
take the responsibility ol' conducting such a drive on the cam
pus. Let it bo hoped that the students will do their share in 
making the drive a succoss.
An Important Amendment.
One ol! the most important things that the Interfraternity 
Council has done this year is the passing ol' an amendment to 
the new rushing rules that provides for the consideration of 
all ruRhing-rulo infractions by a Regulations Committee, which 
is to bo composed ol' three non-partisan faculty members and 
throe In tori! rater n ity Council members. This is the first time in 
a good many years that the Council has endeavored to provide 
for what should be a satisfactory and foolproof means of deal
ing with infractions, lioretoforo, the machinery of the Council 
used in dealing with infraction charges has been ridiculously 
5 n ad equa to,
TJndcr the new ruling, all power of decision of eases aris
ing out ol! the interpretation and application ol! the rules will 
be vested in the Regulations Committee. In all cases, this com
mittees decisions will be accepted by the Council. Another 
provision which should help to better the cause ol! enforcement 
states that a decision must be reached within one month alter 
the date the charge is brought before the Regulations Com
mittee.

English Ways
By PROF. LEO T. LAWLER
It is customary for the teacher of a class in English composition to make for the students the distinctions between the various levels of usage in our language. The practice enables the students to have a clearer view of their objectives in the matter of good usage in language. They will find the highest level, called the literary standard, practically beyond (heir reach or desire of attainment. It is an ideal; The effort to reach it may produce an emasculated product, a halting speaker or lifeless writer. The effort however, to attain the highest ideal might be valuable in that it would qualify a writer in the next level of good usage, that which is generally attained by educated people. These people are not specialists in linguistics or purity of diction, and they are content with a fairly accurate use of words and their com
binations as prescribed by grammar, logic, and good taste. At vari ous times, however, these same educated people may desire a usage of language that is freer, more flexible, and fresher than that which would come within the range of the foregoing levels. An occa sion might demand something more informal, more conversational, less dressed up. For any of these reasons, therefore, a writer might defscend to the colloquial level. Here is the use of languages in personal letters, of the family circle, rather than of the public stage. It allows contractions, . the interchange of can and may, of shall and will. It has even gone so far as to include the anticipatory though ungrammatical who in such expressions as Who are you voting for? or Who was the lady I saw you with? It is a usage that cuts corners in expression. It insures the impressive conveyance of thought by naturalness, ease, and directness. In military usage the colloquial form of the bulky and awkward sentry 
challenge Who goes there? becomes the crisp Wlios there? It is a usage based on information, not on ignorance or illiteracy. It 
contains no conscious offense against some standard of propriety in language usage. It has in common with the first levels mentioned the fundamental purpose of all language, the clear and effective conveyance of thought. Below 
these three levels one should venture with caution.

BIRDIESThe much published pictures of Carnegies Betty Cadets evoked the usual admiring sighs aud gleeful giggles from the groups of students who ran across them in last Fridays papers. But those whose only glimpse of the girls in uniform was obtained in this manner saw only half the picture. It was a cold, cold day and the poor soldier boys who had contributed their hats and coats to the cause found the shivers creeping up and down their spines faster and faster. Finally, in desperation, one shivering lad donned a coat which a fair co-ed had cast aside and the 
rush Avas on. The photographers had no trouble at all getting the girls to smile at the birdie.
WRONG NUMBER
Poor Bill McKenna just cant keep his telephone numbers straight. The other night he called Jack Morris and to his surprise a familiar feminine voice answered the phone. A rather lengthy conversation followed and Bill finally explained how sleepy he was and how he was going to bed early, in fact he thought hed go right to bed. Imagine his embarrassment when the same young lady detected him dancing in his sleep only a few hours later.

QUOD ERAT DEMONSTRANDUMIn a plebe Chein. Lab. class an instructor wrote a warning on the blackboard for the children not to pour I-I20 into the H2S04. One of the less gullible adolescents disagreed and did vice versa, the result was a machine gun-lilce spattering and a loud yell. The instructor rushed to the board, grabbed a piece of chalk, and scribbled under the warningQ. E. D.
LOVE IN A LONDON FOGThe fact that everyone was dancing in a fog didnt in the least depress the spirits of the throng that attended the Doc Carter Cross-Country Dance at Thistle Hall Saturday.

An innovation in the form of pass-out checks supplied to all those who entered did a world of good in bettering smoking conditions.
