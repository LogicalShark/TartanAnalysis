Study shows dangers 
in Facebook apps
AMANDA WILCZYNSKI
Junior Staffwriter
Each day, students are bom
barded with requests to become 
a Greek god, a Disney princess, 
and the biggest brain  on 
Facebook, that is. Over 15,000 
Facebook applications exist 
today, offering a variety of capa
bilities to the social networking 
website. However, according to a 
new study from the University of 
Virginia, users risk losing their 
privacy by simply rating their 
10 hottest friends or discovering 
their ideal desperate housewife.
The survey found that among 
the 150 most popular third-party 
Facebook plugins, 90.7 percent 
have access to unnecessary pri
vate data.
Facebook has over 62 mil
lion users, and, until recently, 
was purely for social network
ing. However, when Facebook 
developers expanded the site 
to include user-created applica
tions in May 2007, a whole new 
world opened up.
Facebook applications take the 
form of quizzes, word games, jig
saw puzzles, and bumper stick
ers, among other varieties.
Adrienne Felt, a senior com
puter science major at the 
University of Virginia, led a 
research project dealing with 
the privacy issues surrounding
the most popular Facebook 
applications.
Felt found that only 8.7 per
cent took no information, 82 
percent took public information, 
and only 9.3 percent actually 
needed private information such 
as a birth date in order to run 
correctly, despite the 90.7 per
cent with unnecessary access.
I personally dont feel unsafe 
using applications, said Lizzy 
Madden, a sophomore public 
policy and management major 
and Facebook user. They are 
not any different from the other 
parts of Facebook.
However, the study from 
Virginia shows that these ap
plications are indeed different 
from other parts of the social 
network.
A Facebook profile and public 
listing is subject to a number of 
safety constraints, none of which 
are present in applications.
Facebook allows users to make 
decisions such as what appears 
on profile pages, who can view 
photos, and exactly how much 
information is visible in public 
listings.
However, in terms of Face
book applications, a student 
has no choice as to what in
formation is being shared. 
When a user chooses to add an

Faculty, Student Senates propose grading changes for undergrads
Pass/fail debated for 
first-years
4.0 may no longer 
make the cut
Future Carnegie Mellon firstyears may soon be in for a severe 
re-grade. At an open meeting on 
Thursday, the Undergraduate 
Student Senate proposed pass/ 
fail grading as an option for 
students in the fall of their first 
year.
Evan Osheroff, a junior busi
ness administration major, chair 
of the Academic Affairs Com
mittee, and co-author of the 
proposal, presented the idea. 
He cited the committees three 
main motivations: eliminating 
parental stress about grades, 
helping the large number of in
ternational students adjust to 
life in the U.S., and allowing 
students to get more involved in 
campus activities.
There is a general complaint 
of apathy at football games and 
in campus activities, he said.
This system will SABRINA PORTER
allow [first-year] News Editor
students time to 
participate because grades are 
not as important.
Osheroff also mentioned 
that a pass/fail grading system 
would allow students to see if 
their major was where they re
ally belonged.
They wont have to get Cs 
and Ds to realize they dont 
want to study their major, he 
said of first-years.
Osheroff mentioned four 
other universities where pass/ 
fail fall semesters for first-years 
have had' beneficial results;
MIT, Johns Hopkins University,
Brown University, and Reed Col
lege all have existing policies. A 
study at MIT showed that for

lon students across 
all disciplines may 
soon be seeing pluses and mi
nuses next to their semester 
grades, and perfection extend
ing far beyond a 4.0.
At Thursdays Senate meeting, 
the Faculty Senate presented its 
proposal for +/- grading for all 
undergraduates.
Vivian Loftness, an architec
ture professor and head of the 
Faculty Senate, explained the 
motivations behind initiating 
a new grading system for un
dergraduates while maintain
ing effective feedback. Citing 
Carnegie Mellon as among the 
toughest QPA schools in our 
pool, Loftness explained that 
this initiative has the potential 
to raise student QPAs.
Can professors give adequate
feedback with a C as a middle 
grade? Loftness asked,
Loftness and members of the 
Faculty Senate voted as a body 
in favor of further exploring 
this question through captur
ing grades that might have been 
earned if +/- grading existed.
The Faculty Senate hopes to 
work with John Papinchak, di
rector of Enrollment Services 
and university registrar, in in
stituting a shadow system by 
which willing faculty members 
would submit a spreadsheet 
comparing full letter grades 
given with the grades that 
would have been given on a +/- 
scale at the end of each semes
ter. They would then be able to 
see the trends in student QPAs.

Carnegie Mellons School of Design was featured 
in the January issue of Sierra Magazine for its post
ers on environmentalism.
The posters came from a project assigned by 
School of Design professor Melissa Cicozi, in her 
class Design and Social Change. For the proj
ect, Cicozi challenged her students to design 
eye-catching posters that encouraged environmen
tal activism.
I wanted students to realize the impact a de
signer can make, and this topic in particular is on 
everyones mind and is a meaningful one for the 
students, Cicozi said.
Cicozi has a history of environmental activism as 
a member of the board for Construction Junction 
and chair of the Parks Advisory Board. As a board 
member of Construction Junction, she assists in the 
organizations conservation efforts and reuse of 
building materials within Pittsburgh.
Cicozi urged her students to aim their posters at 
the college-age demographic by using design tech
niques to catch their attention.
Sierras praise has spurred various articles and 
websites to be written about the posters, and they 
are now even available as postcards.
I was flabbergasted with how amazing the post
ers came out, but the publicity weve received is 
completely unexpected, Cicozi said. The more 
people see it, the more their messages will spread.

Tobacco funding 
goes up in smoke
DAWN WANG
Junior Staffwriter
Students looking to do university research may 
now have more to worry about than ever before. 
An increasing number of colleges and universi
ties nationwide have banned tobacco funding in 
light of the industrys desire to get more involved 
with the students.
The McCombs Business School at the Univer
sity of Texas at Austin was one of the most recent 
schools to ban tobacco funding.
Along with a $150,000 gift, Phillip Morris, the 
largest tobacco company in the U.S., and its par
ent company, the Altria group, wanted to support 
events and educational programs at the business 
school since it recruits a number of the schools 
students as employees each yean
Despite the many avenues this funding went to, 
from the Hispanic Students Business Association 
to a conference on women in business leadership, 
officials at the business school decided in Decem
ber to ban tobacco funding.
Medical and health schools at Emory, Harvard, 
Johns Hopkins, Ohio State, Louisiana State, the 
University of Arizona, the University of Iowa, and 
the University of North Carolina have all banned 
money from the tobacco industry. Their reason
ing, according to The New York Times, is that to
bacco companies misuse research to deceive the 
public about the dangers of smoking, and as a re
sult the truth is muddled.

Professor gets computing honor
Carnegie Mellon professor Edmund M. 
Clarke received one of computings high
est honors last Monday. Clarke, a com
puter science professor, won the 2007 
AM. Turing Award which came with a 
$250,000 award. Two computer scientists 
from the University of Texas at Austin and 
the University of Grenoble in France also 
received the award.
Given annually by the Association for 
Computer Machinery, the award honors 
the most important work in the field of 
computing and is often thought of as the 
Nobel Prize for computing, according to 
a Carnegie Mellon press release. Clarke 
and his partners received the award in 
recognition of their work on an auto
mated method for diagnosing errors in 
computer software and hardware.
The method, known as Model Checking, 
has been essential in the increased reli
ability of computer chips, systems, and 
networks.
In 1987, Clarkes graduate student 
Kenneth McMillan realized that the idea 
could be based on binary decision dia
grams, a method of information symbol
ism formulated by former professor and 
Dean of the School of Computer Science 
Randall Bryant.
As the recipient of this prestigious 
award, Clarke joins three other current 
and emeritus faculty members. Of the 
awards 51 total recipients in its 41-year 
history, 10 have been associated with 
Carnegie Mellon, either as students or 
faculty.
Smart People premieres
Carnegie Mellons very own smart people get rave reviews
Last winters smart visitors to 
Carnegie Mellon made their debut on 
the red carpet in late January, when 
the film Smart People premiered at the 
Sundance Film Festival to the delight 
of critics.
The movie stars Dennis Quaid 
as Carnegie Mellon English profes
sor Lawrence Wetherhold and Sarah 
Jessica Parker as his former student 
and current doctor, Janet. Wetherhold 
is a widow with a young-Republican 
daughter, portrayed by Junos Ellen 
Page, and a son at Carnegie Mellon, 
played by Ashton Holmes. Parkers 
character falls quickly in love with 
Quaids, and the two soon complicate 
each others lives.
Carnegie Mellon students were
used as extras in various scenes and 
as production assistants and interns 
during filming.
The movie features scenes from 
all around campus, from Donner 
Hall (where Wetherholds son lives) 
to Hunt Library to the corridors of 
Baker and Porter halls. According to 
a Miramax spokesperson in a press 
release, Carnegie Mellon comes off 
looking both smart and hip.
Ranked by the Daily News as one of 
the top three Sundance films, Smart 
People will be in theaters nationwide 
April 11.

Last Monday, Carnegie Mellon President Jared Cohon spoke in Rangos about his journey to becom
ing president at the university. Cohon talked of his beginning as a middle-class high school student in 
Cleveland, Ohio to his current station in life. Cohon compared his life to that of Forrest Gump, saying 
that life comes about by sheer accident. He also spoke of his philosophy that what really counts in life is 
not the end result but the journey it takes to get there.
Design professor challenges 
students to inspire with posters
DESIGN, fromAl
Cicozis next assignment for 
her students is to design post
ers for Giant Eagle encouraging 
shoppers to use reusable bags.
The design posters are indica
tive of continuing campus trends 
in environmentalism.
They are being taken seri
ously now and students see it 
as being relevant, Cicozi said 
of environmental initiatives on 
campus. Keeping up with ecofriendly designs is savvy.
In Nov. 2007, Sierra Magazine 
ranked Carnegie Mellon the 10th  
coolest school in the U.S. for its 
efforts to become a greener cam
pus. This year, about 20 percent 
of Carnegie Mellons electricity 
comes from renewable resources 
such as wind energy or small 
hydropower.
Cicozis assignment is just one 
of many advancements Carnegie 
Mellon is making in green liv
ing. There are numerous student 
groups on campus focused on 
making changes.
Sustainable Earth is one ex
ample, joining hundreds of 
schools across the nation in an 
effort to improve the environ
ment. The organization is cur
rently formulating a petition to 
sign for a Presidents Climate 
Commitment. The aim is to 
persuade the Carnegie Mellon
administration to reduce carbon 
emissions and gradually bring 
the schools carbon footprint to 
zero.
Sarah Strano, a sophomore 
civil engineering major and 
president of Sustainable Earth, 
spoke on the clubs intiatives.
Last November, we also sent 
delegates to Power Shift, the 
largest global warming confer
ence ever held, and then even 
lobbied in Washington, she 
said.
A few weeks ago, Sustainable 
Earth participated in Focus the 
Nation, a nationwide teach-in 
on environmentalism. Strano 
described the event as an effort 
to network between the various 
environmental groups on cam
pus and get more people aware 
and involved in current environ
mental issues.
The eco-rep program, in which 
selected students educate their 
fellow housemates on living in 
an environmentally friendly 
way, brings environmentalism 
to student residences.
Eco-reps host events on cam
pus; past events include an or
ganic food tasting and a screen
ing of An Inconvenient Truth.
We have so many opportuni
ties on campus to be eco-friendly. 
We have the funding, eco-rep 
Andrea Tan, a sophomore biol
ogy and psychology major, said.
We have the faculty support. 
We have the facilities. As long as 
we apply ourselves we have the 
ability to make great changes.
Some environmental groups 
focus on improving the environ
ment through their majors.
Net Impact and Engineers for 
a Sustainable World (ESW) focus 
on using educations in business 
and engineering, respectively, to 
make an impact in environmen
talism.
Eddie Wuen, a sophomore civil 
engineering major and member 
of ESW, said, Were a new club. 
For the first meeting we held, a 
great number of people showed 
up, which only goes to show how 
enthusiastic and active many 
students are about this issue.
Besides campus activities, en
vironmental initiatives extend to 
the campus itself, as evidenced in 
a number of campus buildings.
These green initiatives can 
be seen in the LEED-friendly 
(Leadership in Energy and 
Environmental Design) New 
House, Henderson House, and 
Posner Center. Other green ini
tiatives include the green roofs 
on Margaret Morrison, created 
to help regulate temperatures 
in the building and reduce heat
ing and cooling costs while also 
extending the lives of the roofs 
themselves.
Clickers, tablet laptops, and online courses 
change the face of the traditional classroom
STUTI PANDEY
Staffwriter
Students all around the country 
are now clicking, not writing, to 
answer questions in lecture every 
day. The advent of the clicker, dis
tance learning, and tablet laptops 
has dramatically changed the role 
of technology in the classroom.
With digitization on the rise, 
there has been much debate 
whether this movement comes 
hand-iri-hand with depersonal
ization.
Peter Madsen, distinguished 
service professor for ethics and 
social responsibility in the depart
ment of philosophy, observed the 
differing opinions with regard to 
digitizing learning.
Many are fervent proponents 
of e-learning, while others claim 
that something gets lost in the 
rush to digitize the classroom, 
especially in distance education 
formats, he said. Some hold that 
the traditional classroom that 
promotes face-to-face studentteacher contact and dialogue 
cannot be replaced as the best 
and most productive learning 
environment.
Despite the misuse of technol
ogy in the classroom, it has had a 
positive impact on many depart
ments, such as statistics.
Two generations ago if [you] 
were to look at an introduction 
to statistics book, a lot more of 
the course would have been rote 
[routine] calculation, said Gor
don Weinberg, a professor in the 
department of statistics. But 
because we can use calculators, 
and because the importance of 
quantitative literacy is now bet
ter understood, the teaching of 
introductory statistics is now 
using computers more for data
analysis so that the humans can 
focus more in the concepts. 
Weinberg noted that students 
are now able to do more problems 
during a lecture or recitation due 
to the decrease in the process of 
calculations and the increased 
scrutiny of the results.
Students are able to perform 
calculations through computer 
programs such as the R software 
package that quickly make cal
culations, including measures of 
central location and functional 
estimators.
Amid the debates about the 
problems and advantages of the 
digitization of learning, Carnegie 
Mellon has attempted to find the 
best middle ground.
Madsen teaches a course called 
Ethical Judgements in Profes
sional Life, which won awards in 
2003 from the American Council 
of Education and the Institute for 
International Education.
Madsens course examines the 
ethical issues that confront doc
tors, lawyers, engineers, and 
social scientists through stream
ing video, audio CDs, electronic 
discussion boards, web-based re
search, and teleconferences.
Given that technology is inte
grated in the classroom, Mad
sen explained why this course is 
unique in its success.
This is a hybrid course that 
combines traditional classroom 
techniques and technology en
hanced learning, he said. It 
relies upon several key technolo
gies, but it does not give up on the 
idea that the classroom can be a 
place for active discourse, casebased discussions, and caring in
struction.
Madsen suggested that it might 
not just be the mere integration 
of technology to classrooms that
contributes to the class influ
ence, but rather the balancing of 
traditional classroom techniques 
with the smooth incorporation of 
computers, that is successful.
The most innovative techno
logical aspect of this course is its 
use of video conferencing where 
CMU students have the chance 
to meet with students who study 
at Tec de Monterrey in Mexico, 
Madsen continued. They then 
gather in international teams to 
work on professional ethics is
sues, problems, and dilemmas 
through online tools.
Carnegie Mellon is home to a' 
number of technological initia
tives, all of which have been inte
grated into the classroom.
In many physics classes, includ
ing Physics I and II for Engineers, 
among others, clickers are now 
used.
During lecture, a professor 
shows questions on a PowerPoint 
presentation, and students point 
their clickers at a sensor to submit 
their answers, which corresponds 
the letters they press on the click
ers.
Sam Russell, a first-year elec
trical and computer engineering 
major and clicker user, shared his 
experiences.
Back when clickers werent 
used and questions were an
swered verbally by someone rais
ing their hand, you might actu
ally get a relationship with your 
professor, but the vast majority 
of people wont raise their hands, 
especially the people that dont 
know the answer, he said.
However, on the flip side, 
professors can now imme
diately tabulate the classs 
results; they can use feedback 
from the clickers to take atten
dance, in addition to figuring
what percentage of the class 
understands a certain con
cept.
Yet the use of technology 
during lectures is not always 
for academic material.
Daniel LaGrotta, a first-year 
information systems major, 
spoke of the issue of laptops in 
lecture classes.
Even though the use of 
technology in classrooms has 
become more prevalent, this 
also has adverse effects, he 
said. For example, a lot of 
the time I see people with 
laptops in lecture browsing 
Facebook and chatting online, 
but not paying attention to the 
professor.
Tablet laptops, while subject 
to these same distractions, al
low students to take notes on 
the monitor and have dramati
cally changed the process of 
taking notes.
The process of taking a class 
in itself has also changed with 
the advent of online classes.
A new survey from the Sloan 
Foundation and the Babson Re
search Survey Group surveyed 
4500 colleges and universities 
nationwide and found that av

The onset of web-based learning has dramatically lessened the influnce of traditional learning tools, such as books, newspapers, and journals.
Colleges just say no
However, a large number of 
colleges and universities still ac
cept tobacco funding.
The industry funds research 
at a number of colleges and uni
versities, among them Stanford 
University, the University of Cal
ifornia, and other colleges at the 
University of Texas at Austin.
Phillip Morris is currently pro
viding the University of Texas at 
Austin with $455,000 to study 
the effects of cigarette smoke on 
cancer.
Jennifer S. Brodbelt, a re
searcher on the project, de
fended her funding by arguing 
in The New York Times, We are 
all struggling to maintain our re
search programs. If we can find 
new sources to support meritori
ous research, I say lets make the 
most of it.
There are many opinions as to 
where to draw the line for finan
cial support while staying within 
ethical boundaries.
I believe ethics should always 
take a role in financial decisions. 
Personally, I would never feel 
comfortable taking funding 
from a tobacco company, said 
Sudeep Paul, a senior business 
and economics major and chair 
of the Senate Campus Life Com
mittee.
Faculty members of various 
universities argue that by ban
ning tobacco money, the pursuit 
of truth is, in fact, removed com
pletely.
University of California at Los 
Angeles cancer researcher James 
E. Ernstrom argued in The New 
York Times that banning tobacco 
money would infringe on aca
demic freedom.
To dictate what research is 
done at a university destroys the 
objectivity he said.
Currently, Carnegie Mellon 
does not accept funding from to
bacco companies.
It does not seem likely that it 
will, considering the support [to 
ban smoking] that weve gotten 
from the administration, espe
cially President Cohon, Paul 
said.
Carnegie Mellon has brought 
forth a Healthy Campus 2010 
proposal with the eventual goal 
of banning smoking on campus 
in 2010. The initiative can al
ready be seen in the removal of 
cigarettes from Entropy and in 
designating -smoking areas on
campus.
Some speculate that accting 
tobacco money could hurt the 
schools efforts to ban smoking.
Dorian Adeyemi, a junior so
cial and decision sciences major 
and member of the Senate Cam
pus Life Committee, agrees with 
Paul.
It would be hypocritical of 
the administration to accept 
funding while in the process 
of banning smoking, Adeyemi 
said.
From 2002 to 2006, Carnegie 
Mellon partnered with Dickin
son College to conduct research 
to identify cancer subtypes more 
precisely, leading to improved 
diagnoses and treatments. The 
$3.5 million funding came from 
the Pennsylvania Department of 
Health, more specifically from 
Pennsylvanias tobacco settle
ment funds, which is set aside 
expressly for research.
Through the settlement funds, 
Carnegie Mellon was able to use 
the tobacco industrys money in
directly, thus staying free of the 
industrys committments.
In general, Carnegie Mellon 
receives its funding from a vari
ety of resources, some of which 
are considered controversial.
For example, Carnegie Mellon 
gets funding from oil compa
nies, but as Teresa Thomas, as
sistant vice president for media 
relations, said, The grants have 
tended to be for green or envi
ronmental research.
Carnegie Mellon research is 
also supported by the Depart
ment of Defense.
From 2002 to 2007, Carnegie 
Mellons Center for Computer 
and Communications Security 
received $35.5 million from the 
Defense Department.
Carnegie Mellons funding 
from the government is often 
protested by members of the 
Pittsburgh community. The most 
recent demonstration was two 
Saturdays ago, when a group of 
50 people gathered in front of 
the National Research Engineer
ing Center to protest a new grant 
from the Department of Defense 
to further develop warfare ma
chines for the U.S. army.
When asked about compar
ing defense funding to tobacco 
companies, Paul replied, Gov
ernment endorsements dont af
fect the atmosphere of CMU; the 
school doesnt lean in favor of 
the governments decisions.

At Thursdays open Senate meeting, Senators and non-Senators spoke out on the advantages and disadvantages of the new grading proposals.
Pass/fail grading
STUDENT, fromAl
first-years, first-semester GPAs 
were nearly one-third of a point 
lower than the all-university av
erage before the pass/fail system 
was initiated.
However, opinions at Carnegie 
Mellon were mixed as to the help
fulness of such a measure.
Many students expressed that 
allowing pass/fail grading in the 
first semester would only put off 
the inevitable wake-up call of 
college until the next semester.
Others worried that students 
might abuse the policy, taking 
their hardest courses in the fall of 
their first year so as not to receive 
a potentially poor letter grade.
Sean Weinstock, a senior busi
ness administration major and 
student body president, spoke in 
favor of the measure.
This idea was part of the 
CMU5 campaign, Weinstock 
said. In my opinion, it seems 
like a pass/fail system would al
low future freshmen to adjust to 
life away from home before grad
ing and potentially round out 
the college experience from the 
start.
Some students expressed con
cern that this measure would
conflict with existing pass/fail 
policies for all undergraduates.
Under current policies, stu
dents are allowed to take a class 
pass/fail as long as they are not 
planning on counting it toward 
their major.
The School of Computer Sci
ence recently changed its policies 
so that while a D is not a failing 
grade, students must retake a 
class in which they receive a D 
if they are planning on count
ing it toward a computer science 
major.
Osheroff said that the commit
tee was in the beginning stages 
of the proposal and it had not yet 
decided what the letter boundar
ies of pass/fail would be.
Jared Itkowitz, a junior busi
ness administration major and 
Student Senate chair, conducted 
an informal straw poll of Sena
tors and non-Senators that 
revealed a close count of students 
for and against the proposal. Six 
students voted to implement the 
system immediately, 23 voted to 
research it further, and 24 voted 
to drop the issue altogether.
The Faculty Senate has yet 
to vote on pass/fail grading for 
first-years.
QPA may be redefined
FACULTY, fromAl
similar idea to this +/- proposal 
five years ago, but due to lack 
of student support, it was not 
continued.
Faculty members have always 
been given the option to do +/- 
grading at mid-semester.
However, Loftness insisted 
that students cannot rely on mid
semester grades to show what 
would happen if there were a 
change, since these are mostly 
used as indicators.
Although it has never been in
stituted for undergraduates, a 
similar +/- grading system exists 
with graduate students.
Titled the 4+ Graduate Student 
Grading Standard, the system, 
instituted in 1995, applies to all 
graduate colleges and allows the 
possibility of getting a QPA above 
a 4.0 (except for CIT and H&SS). 
A student who receives all A+ 
grades is given a 4.33, while a 
student with all Agrades is 
given a 3.67 QPA.
Under the current undergradu
ate system, the same QPA earned 
with all As could be earned by 
getting both As and Bs.
Most of our peer institu
tions have a +/- system [for
undergraduates], Papinchak 
said.
Student opinions differed 
greatly on the matter.
At the Senate meeting, many 
students expressed concern that 
+/- grading would benefit only 
certain academic colleges, spe
cifically CFA and H&SS, while 
hurting CIT, MCS, and SCS.
There was also a big worry 
that this system would perpetu
ate what is already a culture of 
stress, as one student described.
Loftness mentioned that the 
idea for testing was in preliminary 
stages and that each department 
and major would be individually 
and carefully looked at.
Jared Itkowitz, a junior busi
ness administration major and 
Student Senate chair, performed 
an informal straw poll of both 
Senators and non-Senators pres
ent at the meeting about +/- 
grading.
One student voted to imple
ment it immediately, 46 voted to 
investigate the matter, and nine 
voted to drop the matter com
pletely.
The Faculty Senate hopes to 
soon be able to formalize its 
proposal and bring a vote to the 
Student Senate.
Facebook risks 
user privacy
UVA study shows the majority 
of applications have access to 
unnecessary personal information
FACEBOOK, fromAl
application, the developer can access his or her personal 
information.
I had no idea applications could view that kind of in
formation, Madden said. Its scary to think that some 
random person could find out my birth date or home 
address.
Facebooks Terms of Use agreement informs develop
ers not to misuse private information, yet has no means 
of preventing them from doing so. There are no indica
tors as to when a developer plans to or may be accessing 
private information.
Facebook officials defended their policies.
By limiting developers access to user data, Facebook 
would be limiting the types of useful applications that 
can be built, said a spokesperson from Facebook in a 
press release.
B.J. Fogg, director of Stanford Universitys Persuasive 
Technology Lab, co-teaches a course at the university 
about developing Facebook applications.
Like most things in the world, it is a trade-off, and the 
risks are low compared to the benefits, he said in The 
Chronicle of Higher Education.
However, some people remained unconvinced.
The Facebook privacy policy always seemed unsatis
factory to me, Felt said in a press release.
Although it is unknown as to whether any application 
developers have misused private data yet, Felt said in an 
e-mail interview, I find it unsettling to know that my 
personal information and interests are available in an 
uncontrolled arena.
According to Felt, the fact that it has not happened yet 
does not mean it will not.
Felts research is nowhere near complete as she contin
ues to examine means of safety prevention every day.
She has developed a privacy-by-proxy system that will 
allow Facebook to conceal a users private information 
while allowing applications to run without any obvious 
changes.
Under the system, Facebook would provide the outside 
server with a random series of letters instead of the users 
personal information.
However, until Felts system or similar privacy settings 
can be fully applied to applications, Felt advises students 
to be cautious when choosing what new application to 
add.
Dont just add random Facebook applications! Look on 
the about page to see who runs and owns it, Felt said. 
Remember that youre giving them access to informa
tion just like they were your friend.

Atlantis takes off 
after long delay
According to a recent report 
in the Archives of Pediatrics and 
Adolescent Medicine, one-third of 
all songs teenagers are exposed 
to explicidy refer to abuse of 
drugs or alcohol.
Conducted by the University of 
Pittsburgh School of Medicine, 
the study was based on 279 of 
the most popular songs of 2005, 
as listed by Billboard magazine. 
The study further states that 
on average, adolescents are 
exposed to over 30,000 refer
ences to substance abuse via 
music each year.
Behavioral studies have 
shown that images of sub
stance abuse in film have a large 
impact on adolescent viewers
 increasing the likelihood of 
addiction.
While these studies have yet 
to be conducted for music, sci

Obesity is more 
nature than nurture
According to a study led by 
Jane Wardle, director of Cancer 
Research UKs Health Behavior 
Centre, obesity is due largely to 
genetic factors, rather than diet 
and upbringing.
The study was carried out on 
over 5000 pairs of twins and 
conclusively determined that 
genetic factors were far more 
prevalent in determining future 
obesity of children.
Statistical analyses showed 
that obesity is 77 percent due 
to genetic factors and 23 due to 
lifestyle and environment.
Researchers said that while 
this does not mean that children 
with obesity genes will certain
ly become overweight, it does 
give them a significantly higher 
chance of gaining more weight 
than children without family 
histories.

Men addicted to 
video games
The territorial instinct of 
males is to blame for their 
addiction to video games, say 
Stanford scientists.
In a study recently published 
in the Journal of Psychiatric 
Research, scientists suggest that 
much greater activity takes 
place in the mesocorticolimbic 
area of the male brain while 
playing a territorial-based game 
than in the female brain.
The mesocorticolimbic region 
is largely associated with addic
tion and reward in human 
beings.
The study also suggested that 
when playing a non-territorialbased game, male and female 
brain patterns are similar.

Vacuum cleaners 
save heart patients
New research into blood 
clotting has shown that use 
of a mini-vacuum to suck out 
blood clots leads to fewer com
plications for patients with 
blocked arteries, as opposed to 
conventional methods.
Conventional methods of 
clearing blood vessels such as 
angioplasty, which involves 
inflation of a balloon within 
the blood vessel to clear out 
blockage, have been shown to 
potentially break off pieces of 
blood clots, which may then 
obstruct smaller blood vessels.
The study, published in the 
New England Journal of Medicine 
last Thursday, shows that using 
the mini-vacuum to clear out 
the blockage has been shown to 
significantiy lower the risks of 
serious complications.

Lice found in 
mummified bodies
Scientists have discovered 
lice in two mummified bod
ies discovered in Peru that are 
about 1000 years old.
The lice found had the same 
DNA as the most widespread 
louse species today.
In the past, biologists as
sumed that European colonists 
brought lice to North and South 
America  as they did smallpox 
and measles  but these new 
findings suggest otherwise. If 
anything, some scientists theo
rized, colonists might have 
brought lice back to Europe.
Scientists also hope that this 
finding will help them study

Cause of ic shelf 
collapse found
Scientists have asserted that 
climate change was not the only 
factor behind the collapse of 
Larsen B, a 500 billion ton ice 
shelf in Antarctica that broke 
apart in 2002.
The scientists, Neil Glasser 
of Aberystwyth University and 
Ted Scambos of Colorado Uni
versity, cited atmospheric and 
glaciological factors, includ
ing small breaks within the ice 
shelf that had weakened the 
structure.
The study states that global 
warming contributed to the 
problem, but was not the sole 
cause of Larsen Bs collapse.
In 1998, researchers from the 
British Antarctic Survey warned 
that some ice shelves in Antarc
tica would soon collapse due to 
increasing water temperatures. 
But Glasser and Scambos assert 
that other factors that Larsen B 
was close to collapsing for de
cades.

Tooth shows Nean

Analysis of a 40,000-year-old 
tooth discovered in Greece is 
leading scientists to think that 
Neanderthals were more mobile 
than many had once thought. 
Neanderthals are a now-extinct 
species of Homo genus that lived 
in areas of Europe and Asia.
Scientists looked at the ra
tios of strontium isotope in the 
tooths enamel. Strontium is a 
metal naturally found in both 
food and water.
The strontium levels in the 
tooth suggested that the Nean
derthal must have lived about
12.5 miles from the space where 
it died.
The analysis was conducted 
by members of the Max Planck 
Institute, which researches the

How Things Work: Legos
SHEILA PRAKASH
Staffwriter
Legos. We have all played with 
them. For decades, these tiny 
blocks of plastic have inspired 
children and adults alike to rip 
open a bag and unleash their ar
tistic creativity.
Lego kits exist for almost ev
erything under the sun. There 
are kits for Lamborghinis and 
kits for mythical creatures. There 
are kits for missions to Mars (the 
Mars Mobile Mining Unit will 
collect Mars samples, but only 
after reporting to the Mars Eagle 
Command Base). There is even a 
kit for The Indiana Jones Motor
cycle Chase.
New kits, like Lego TECHNIC 
and Lego BIONICLE, allow you to 
build Lego bulldozers with pneu
matic cylinders and breathe life 
into action figures like Hakann, 
Toa Nuparu, and Zaktan.
There are even companies 
dedicated to the sale of life-like 
Lego products. BrickGun (www. 
brickgun.com) is a website that 
specializes in selling state of the 
art weapons, like the IMI Desert 
Eagle and the Beretta 92FS  all 
made entirely of Legos.
Despite its sophistication, the 
underlying components of a Lego 
masterpiece are surprisingly 
simple. The standard Lego piece 
is a 2x4 multicolored brick.
However, the dimensions can 
vary greatly; these can be found 
by counting the number of studs 
(or bumps) along either side. 
Other basic Lego elements in
clude the peg, plate, and beam.
Lego pieces begin as multicol
ored granules. The granules are 
made of acrylonitrile butadiene 
styrene (ABS), a thermoplastic 
commonly used for molding and 
shaping because it melts to a liq
uid when heated. The granules 
come in eight basic colors: red, 
yellow, white, blue, black, dark 
grey, light grey, and green.
hannan Kosen/Knoto stair
The granules are loaded onto 
a truck and taken to a Lego fac
tory. At the factory, the granules 
are siphoned out of the truck and 
showered into a three-story tall 
metal silo.
A mountain of Lego granules 
resembles a mound of salt or sand 
in appearance  except that the 
constituents are tiny pieces of 
plastic.
Each silo holds 33 tons of Lego 
granules.
Once in the silo, the granules 
are fed into a molding machine 
through a large pipe. Here, the
granules are heated to 450F.
The extreme temperatures are 
required to melt the plastic gran
ules and force them into a mold
ing apparatus.
Inside the molding appara
tus, 150 pounds of pressure are 
applied to shape them into the fa
miliar pieces we see in toy stores 
and childrens bedrooms.
Since the slightest deviation in 
size destroys a Legos snap and 
bind ability, the molds have a 
precision tolerance of 0.002 mil
limeters.
At any given moment, 2.16 
million Lego components are 
being molded around the world. 
This translates to about 19 bil
lion Lego bricks a year  roughly 
the GDP of Burkina Faso.
The molding machinery is so 
precise that only 18 out of every 
1 million Lego bricks produced 
are considered faulty.
After several seconds of ap
plied heat and pressure, the 
newly minted Lego pieces are 
ejected from the mold and 
tossed onto a conveyor belt, 
where they are allowed to cool. 
At the end of the belt, the pieces 
are dumped into a large box. 
Once the box is filled, it is picked 
up by a robotic truck and taken 
across the factory to the assem
bly hall.

Interdisciplinary endeavors 
have long been embedded within 
the Carnegie Mellon tradition of 
collaborative study. Cognitive 
neuroscience professor Mar
cel Just and computer science 
professor Tom M. Mitchell per
petuate this tradition with their 
groundbreaking efforts in brain 
research. The prestigious W.M. 
Keck Foundation awarded the 
duo a $1.1 million grant to carry 
out extensive research in the field 
of brain imaging.
The study, titled Using fMRI 
Brain Activation to Identify 
Cognitive States Associated 
with Perception of Tools and 
Dwellings, was a joint venture 
between the departments of neu
rology and computer science and 
was published on January 2 in 
PLoS one, an open-access, online 
publication by the Public Library 
of Science.
Just, who is also the co-direc
tor of the Brain Imaging Research 
Center at Carnegie Mellon, said 
that this is the first time that 
anybody has been able to track 
the specific object of a persons 
thoughts.
Previously, the best [that has 
been done] was to identify the 
category of objects, tools, or a 
type of dwelling that was being 
thought of, he said.
Just, Mitchell, and their team 
employed a unique combination 
of brain scans and machinelearning algorithms to ascertain
what a person is thinking of at 
a particular moment. Machine 
learning refers to a support sys
tem of artificial intelligence that 
uses algorithmic programs to 
help computers index informa
tion. This latest breakthrough 
can help form the relationship be
tween a cognitive situation, such 
as the thought of an apple, and 
the activity behind this thought
 the magnetic signals that are 
emitted when the thought of an 
apple occurs  in single and
multiple brain regions.
The complexity of the human 
brain explicates itself through 
ongoing activity in that part of 
the central nervous system. This 
brain activity was measured by 
functional magnetic resonance 
imaging (fMRI) scanning.
While conventional magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) of the 
brain provides detailed imag
ery of the tissues, fMRI shows 
the magnetic energy emanating 
from the brain.
The researchers used the Sie
mens Allegra 3.0T scanner, an 
innovative machine at the collab
orative Brain Imaging Research 
Center shared by Carnegie Mellon University and the University 
of Pittsburgh.
Weve learned how the brain 
represents concepts that we 
describe by concrete words, 
Mitchell stated in a Carnegie 
Mellon press release.
The brain activity levels, in 
terms of magnetic signals, can 
be assessed using oxygen levels 
in different sections of the brain. 
When there is a greater amount 
of oxygen in the active region of 
the brain, a stronger magnetic
signal is generated. A stronger 
magnetic signal suggests higher 
neural activity.
After obtaining a trend of 
magnetic signals, the team ap
plied computer algorithms to 
these scanned images in order to 
decipher the signals transmitted 
during brain activity.
The first phase of applying al
gorithms involves finding voxels 
that express a similar pattern 
over a number of trials. Voxels are 
volume elements normally used 
in the examination of medical 
data. While pixels characterize 
2D image data, voxels represent 
3D image data. The second phase 
focuses on subsets of voxels. Each
voxel can be virtually anywhere 
in the many possible levels of ac
tivity in the brain.
These algorithms help sci
entists acquire the mapping 
between individual items and 
brain activity levels.
In the context of the published 
study, the team tested algorithms 
on a group of subjects and dis
covered that the codes emitted in 
most human brains are similar.
As of yet, this technology only 
applies to concrete objects, like 
apples. However, according to 
Just, in the future, more abstract 
notions, such as people or ideas, 
will also be explored through this 
examination of the human brain.
Just and Mitchell intend to use 
a variety of methods that will 
help interpret brain activity in 
terms of language, according to 
the press release. Computational 
studies of English text, along with 
fMRI scans of the brain interpret
ing words, activating signals, 
and translating those signals into 
concrete ideas largely shape the 
teams future plans.
Despite the advanced nature 
of brain imaging, students play 
an important role in this re
search, Just said. From student 
participants to those who have 
completed their honors thesis in 
areas of neuroscience, there is 
significant student involvement 
in the field.
Down the line, the professors 
insight into the brain activity may 
help gain a better understanding 
of neurological disorders such as 
schizophrenia and dyslexia.
Just, Mitchell, and their team employed 
a unique combination of brain scans and 
machine-learning algorithms to ascertain 
what a person is thinking of at a particu
lar moment.

Health Talk: Meningococcal bacteria
AKANKSHA VAIDYA
Staffwriter
Perhaps one of the most 
annoying experiences of col
lege preparation is the long list 
of vaccines that students have to 
receive. Each vaccine translates 
into a long wait in the midst of 
coughing and sneezing people, 
followed by a huge needle, sear
ing pain, and that sore arm for 
the next day or so.
Still, injections are worth the 
pain, and students should be 
thankful they have to take them.
Vaccines against meningo
coccal disease are on the top of 
the list of vaccines required for 
college students, and for good 
reason.
Meningococcal disease pri
marily affects young children 
and adults between the ages of 
15 and 20, and has been consid
ered one of the biggest threats on 
college campuses.
According to the American Col
lege Health Association, around 
100 to 125 cases of meningo
coccal disease occur on college 
campuses each year, and five to 
15 of those cases are fatal.
Meningococcal disease is often 
caused by the bacteria Neisseria 
meningitidis (commonly known 
as the meningococcal bacte
ria) and can take two forms: 
meningococcal meningitis and 
meningococcal septicaemia.
Meningococcal meningitis is 
perhaps the most notorious form 
of the disease. However, the 
lesser-known form of the disease, 
meningococcal septicaemia, is 
the real killer.
Although meningitis can cause 
permanent brain damage, less 
than 5 percent people who con
tract it die. Septicaemia, on the 
other hand, has a higher fatality 
rate at around 20 percent.
It is surprising to see such 
contrasting effects due to an 
infection by the same bacteria. 
What is even more surprising is 
that these bacteria usually re
side in the nose and throat of 
healthy individuals without ever 
harming them.
Our bodys immune system has 
ways of keeping these bacteria in 
check and not letting them spread 
into the bloodstream. However,
the bacteria sometimes manage 
to trick the immune system and 
come out of the nose and throat 
into the bloodstream. From the 
bloodstream, the bacteria follow 
two different routes.
The bacteria may cross over 
from the bloodstream into the 
membranes (called the menin
ges) covering the brain, causing 
an infection of the meninges  
hence the name meningitis.
The bacteria then infect the 
fluid surrounding the menin
ges and travel to the spinal cord 
through this fluid. Bacterial tox
ins cause the inflammation of the 
meninges. This inflammation 
puts pressure on the nerves in the
brain and spinal cord, giving rise 
to symptoms such as a stiff neck, 
headache, and drowsiness.
If not treated early on, menin
gitis proceeds to its final stage in 
which the person may go into a 
coma.
On the contrary, septicaemia 
is caused if the bacteria do not 
move out of the bloodstream. 
When the bacteria remain and 
multiply in the bloodstream, they 
release toxins. The toxins harm 
the body in a number of ways. 
They attract the immune system, 
thus preventing it from attacking 
the real cause of the problem, the 
meningococcal bacteria.
They then act on the heart,
disrupting its ability to pump 
blood. Last, they puncture the 
walls of the blood vessels, which 
causes the blood to leak out.
The result is a large-scale hem
orrhage throughout the body, 
which affects blood flow to vital 
organs, causing the organs to 
malfunction. Unless the symp
toms are recognized quickly, a 
person is not left with much time 
to live.
One of the main reasons why 
septicaemia is so deadly is that it 
spreads very rapidly. Meningitis 
does not spread that quickly and 
that makes it slightly less harm
ful.
While septicaemia is lethal,
it is also rare. Antibiotic treat
ment early on usually helps fight 
the disease. However, recent 
information regarding these an
tibiotics is slightly disturbing. 
Health officials in Minnesota and 
North Dakota have reported three 
cases in which the commonly 
used antibiotic ciprofloxacin was 
ineffective.
Drug-resistant strains of the 
bacteria point to an overdose of 
the antibiotic. Although there 
are other antibiotics that can be 
used, the drug-resistant strains 
suggest a scary future for the dis
ease. Therefore, the best way for 
people to protect themselves is 
through vaccination.
The meningococcal bacte
ria are found in the respiratory 
tracts and saliva of a carrier, 
which means they can be spread 
through coughing, sneezing, or 
personal items like coffee cups.
Vaccination is the smart thing 
to do, but there are sound rea
sons for why it is so adamantly 
targeted to college students:
College students should be 
especially careful, as avoiding 
direct contact with people who 
are sneezing or coughing is vir
tually impossible in a dorm.
Sharing personal items like 
lip-gloss and coffee cups is also a 
large part of college life. Campus 
lifestyle makes college students a 
high-risk group for meningococ
cal disease.
Two vaccines are commonly 
prescribed for college students. 
Menomune has been approved 
by the FDA and has been avail
able since 1981, and a relatively 
new vaccine called MenactraT 
was approved in 2005.
Both of these vaccines are ca
pable of preventing infection 
from four strains of the bacteria, 
namely A, C, Y and W-135. A fifth 
strain, B, does not have a vaccine 
as of yet.
However, since C and W-135 
are the most common strains of 
the bacteria, the vaccines are 
helpful in most situations. In 
fact, the vaccines are the only 
means of prevention.
A glance at the big picture re
veals that vaccines are more than 
just pain-inflicting needles ready 
to make their way into students.

Microsoft should stick to softwareFromTheEditorialBoardMeanwhile, as Microsoft contemplated 
its next move, Google acquired You
Tube, Yahoo! acquired Flickr, and Apple 
made millions selling the iPhone. This 
meant that, while its competitors were 
moving forward, Microsofts growth be
came stagnant.
The reason for this is evident: While 
Google and Apple were giving young 
workers ample freedom to formulate, 
develop, and implement their ideas, Mi
crosofts workers were no longer in touch 
with their customers wants and needs.
In less than five years, Google went 
from being just a search engine to a se
rious competitor for Microsoft. This is 
why, in complete desperation, Micro
soft made its bid for Yahoo!. Perhaps Bill 
Gates hopes that revamping another po
tential Google competitor will stimulate 
his flagging company.
What Gates fails to realize is that ac
quiring Yahoo! will pose more problems 
than it can solve. Even if they do merge, 
Microsoft will have to make many diffi
cult decisions. Yahoo! mail or Windows 
Live mail? Enhance MSN or modify the 
Yahoo! structure? Billions of dollars 
will be spent figuring out how to move 
forward, and almost none will be spent 
actually doing so.
Microsoft needs to cut its losses. Get 
rid of the products that are expensive 
to maintain, and return to its original 
strengths: a robust operating system 
like Windows XP, a superb Office Suite 
like Office 2003, and a powerful gam
ing console like the Xbox 360. Instead of 
trying to fight with Google over e-mail 
superiority, or with Apple over the iPod, 
Microsoft should strengthen Vista. Even 
Windows XP had a disastrous start, but 
it became the biggest asset to the com
pany in recent history.
Only after re-establishing itself as a 
leader in its core market should Micro
soft look to diversify.
In the past few weeks, Microsoft has 
been portrayed as a struggling giant, a 
company in disarray, and an empire on 
the edge of disaster. Such talk has been 
amplified by the companys massive $45 
billion bid for Yahoo! on Feb. 1, perhaps 
an attempt to counter its growing com
petition, Google. And although its true 
that Microsoft is no longer the potent 
force that it was 10 years ago, its cer
tainly not a doomed company.
Yes, there was a time when Bill Gates 
and his buddies had it all. Windows 98 
was a world superpower in its own right, 
and Hotmail and MSN dominated the 
market for e-mail and news-based web
sites. But this monopoly would not last 
forever  and I think Gates knew that.
Apples easy-to-use Macintosh comput
ers began to replace the slow and burden
some Microsoft PCs, and companies such 
as Google and Yahoo! began to capture 
significant portions of the Internet mar
ket. Where was Microsoft in this picture?
Its simple: They couldnt adapt fast 
enough to a changing market environ
ment. This isnt to say they didnt try; on 
the contrary, they made a great effort 
in 2006. They released the Xbox 360 to 
compete with the Sony PS2; set up an 
extensive network of web-based applica
tions under the banner of Windows Live; 
released the Zune, an intended competi
tor to Apples enormously popular iPod; 
and finally released Windows Vista, the 
much-hyped successor to Windows XP.
None of this saved the company.
Microsoft gambled on the success of 
this vast range of products, but has yet 
to realize that it is quality rather than 
quantity that is of greater importance.
Its resources were poorly allocated, 
and apart from the relative success of 
the Xbox 360, the rest of the companys Akshay Dave (asdave@J is a first-year 
ambitious endeavors ended in failure. ECE major. He welcomes all responses.
Mixing cultures at Education City
Qatar, western universities must neces
sarily erode some traditional Muslim or 
Qatari ways of thinking.
Many Qataris and visitors to Qatar 
seem to recognize this process, but re
main unfazed. Most seem to think that 
Qatar knows exactly what it is doing and 
are satisfied with its progress. Indeed, 
The Qatar Foundation for Education, 
Science, and Community Development, 
which facilitates the development of 
Education City and the arrival of west
ern institutions, has as its goal not the 
preservation of Qatari culture, but the 
development of Qatars small but able 
pool of human resources into a globally 
competitive workforce.
For Qatar, the question is not one of 
money for investment, but of time. Edu
cation systems can take centuries to de
velop, so a home-grown network of uni
versities was out of the question. Instead, 
The Foundation decided to expedite the 
process. If your culture is holding you 
back from competing in the global mar
ketplace, why not just buy another?
While developing strong education 
systems is key for smaller nations to 
make themselves competitive on the 
global level, doing so at the expense of 
traditional culture could have unantici
pated repercussions. To take an environ
mental example, when Doha and Dubai 
wanted to sell real estate, it seemed like 
a great idea to build artificial island com
munities off of the coast, and they were a 
success. Now, however, we can see that 
the dredging necessary to build these is
lands has compromised the aquatic eco
system of much of the gulf region. Un
fortunately, making the most expedient 
choices in development can result in un
desirable and irreversible consequences.

New grading system will bring more competition
obsolete  now you would need As-toA-pluses to balance out A-minuses.
This grading system, as used for cur
rent graduate students, is called the 4-1- 
Graduate Student Grading Standard, and 
seems to be something that would just 
serve to further stratify undergraduates. 
The system changes the meaning of 
straight As, adding another level of 
stress to students already-burdened 
mental states. The fact that this method 
would divide student grades into more 
sections for students to fit into seems to 
contradict the reason Carnegie Mellon 
gives for not ranking students, accord
ing to Enrollment Services Academic 
Regulations: In an institution where 
students educational experiences are 
so varied, class rank is not a meaningful 
way to measure achievement.
This begs the question: What purpose 
does the 4+ system serve? Does the cur
rent 10-point-spread-per-letter-grade al
low too many students to get As? It only 
makes sense that in the end, implement
ing this system might result in inflated 
grades. Its said that our undergraduate 
grades are lower on average than those 
of our peer institutions, so the system 
could help students stay in the nation
ally accepted 4.0 scale.
It is important to note that a few years 
ago, Student Senate discussed the same 
+/- grading system  and voted against 
it. There is some worry over whether 
the new A+ grades will even be attain
able, as professors may be hesitant to 
give them out to students whose perfor
mances are even slightly flawed.
The academic environment here is 
already intense, competitive, and stress
ful; students dont need an increasingly 
stratified grading system to heighten 
these qualities.
The old news: Carnegie Mellon is home to 
a competitive and stressful environment.
Its hard to believe that this campus 
could become more competitive than 
it already is. However, this past week, 
Student Senate posted notices of a new 
grading system being pushed by Faculty 
Senate: incorporating +/- grading into 
undergraduate QPAs.
The good news: Now students could 
have even more opportunities to engage 
in competitive complaining.
Currently, undergraduate students 
are graded on a 4.0 scale. Graduate 
students, however, are already graded 
with +/- considerations. For all graduate 
students except those in CIT and H&SS, 
anA+ is worth 4.33 grade quality points. 
The 4.33 sounds good, at least until you 
compare it to an A-, which is only worth 
3.67 grade points. Suddenly, the 3.67 
you could get with a few As and a B is
Student-funded lectures should be publicized
Last Tuesday, a $10,000 lecture was 
held in McConomy Auditorium.
Mark Sterner gave a lecture titled 
DUI: A Powerful Lesson, about a 1994 
incident in which he killed three of his 
best friends while driving drunk. Sterner 
received a three-year jail sentence and 
12 years of probation. Since getting out 
of jail, he has traveled to universities na
tionwide recounting his story. Sterner 
gave part of his lecture in his orange 
jail clothes and showed a video of his 
friends having fun that night, followed 
by images of the crash scene.
Sterner called his $10,000 fee to the 
school one of necessitythe costs were 
used for traveling and living expenses. 
Emotional counselors were even on 
scene to assist students who needed to
discuss the lecture afterwards, which 
only added to already obscene costs. Ac
cording to Sterner, no profits are made 
from any of his lectures.
The majority of the 400 students pres
ent were Greek, but the lecture required 
the financial assistance of non-Greek 
student organizations. With contribu
tions from fraternities and sororities still 
not covering the cost, the sponsoring 
fraternity, Pi Delta Psi, who initiated the 
lecture after a recent drunk driving trag
edy involving brothers, had to look even 
further. The fraternity got support from 
Student Senate, Student Affairs, and Stu
dent Life, among others, all of whom use 
portions of our student activities fee.
Each semester, students pay an $86 activ
ities fee for activities that meet the reason
ably predictable needs of college students. 
However, non-Greek students were 
not well-informed about this lecture.
The big issue here is one of numbers. 
The lecture cost $10,000, and only 400 
students, the majority of which were 
Greek, were in attendance. Further
more, all university students pay a fee 
each semester which entitles them to 
full publicity of such events.
This event had two Facebook groups, 
both initiated by Greeks, and whose in
vitees couldnt encompass the campus 
community. There were also few posters 
seen in heavy-traffic areas on campus.
If the whole university had known 
about this lecture as they shouldve, they 
mightve attended and been eager to see 
what their $10,000 was going toward.

The rapid expansion that Qatar, and 
specifically its largest city, Doha, has 
seen in the past few decades is remark
able. Set against the nearby gargantuan 
regions of Dubai and Abu Dhabi, Doha 
may seem like no more than a cast-off 
suburb, but the unassuming city of 
400,000 has been developing a strong 
set of ties with western universities.
In addition to the five universities 
already there  Carnegie Mellon, 
Georgetown, Virgina Commonwealth, 
Texas A&M, and Cornell  Northwest
ern plans to offer courses in journalism 
in the region. For a city roughly the size 
of Pittsburgh to have access to the best 
programs of a half-dozen of the U.S.s 
premier institutions is extraordinary, 
but not without its risks. Such a high 
concentration of western higher-education institutions, not to mention a large 
cohort of western corporations, has the 
potential to wash out whatever tradi
tional culture exists in Qatar.
In her 2006 commencement speech 
at Carnegie Mellon, Sheikha Mozah, 
chair of the Qatar Foundation, tried to 
draw parallels between the West and 
Islam in an attempt to diminish the idea 
that the two regions are at odds. While 
there are likely many common goals be
tween the nations that we can work on, 
it is not a stretch to assume that Qatari 
students exposed to the nearly all-west
ern faculty of Education Citys universi
ties will develop news ways of thinking 
that accord with their instructors west
ern views. This process is normal at all 
universities in the U.S., but here we are 
talking primarily about western influ
ences rooted in a western context. In
Faculty get involved in student housing
For many students, sustained interaction 
with faculty can be very difficult to over
come. An apparent dearth of substantial rela
tionships with the faculty sometimes makes 
Carnegie Mellon feel like a larger institution 
than it actually is. To combat this, Student Af
fairs is pushing for first-year living communi
ties with more faculty involvement.
For students in certain first-year resi
dences, Student Affairs developed the 
Big Questions program last semester, 
which allowed faculty to go directly into 
the lounges to discuss controversial top
ics with first-year students. The program 
was a mixed success; while some groups 
didnt get off of the ground, others con
tinued to meet after the program ended.
However, seeing that faculty participa
tion in Global Studies House has proved 
fruitful, plans to introduce Tepper fac
ulty into the housing community have
the potential to revitalize the concept.
While such initiatives havent met with 
unqualified success, Student Affairs is still 
moving first-year housing in the right di
rection, and we encourage them to look at 
a model well-entrenched at various other 
universities: At University of Chicago, 
for example, many residence halls have 
live-in faculty that function similarly to 
Carnegie Mellons housefellows.
Chicagos is a model worth emulating 
for the strong relationships that develop 
between students and faculty. Such a com
munity is not foreign to Carnegie Mellon. 
Before it burned down, the stone mansion 
at Amberson and Fifth Avenues used to 
house a successful living community of 
students and faculty for many years.
Regardless of whether faculty live with 
students or not, we hope that Student Af
fairs will continue to adopt more programs
in the vein of Big Questions, which affect 
more students throughout the school than 
individual professors becoming involved 
with specialized communities.
While specialized academic or themebased living communities are effective, 
they already tend to be more insular 
than average first-year communities, 
and the addition of faculty into the mix 
might make them even more so. Having 
faculty work deeply with specific com
munities may have the adverse effect of 
making other first-years feel like they 
are locked out of exclusive groups and 
are not entitled to metacurricular bonds 
with the faculty. This is exactly the men
tality faculty involvement aims to erode. 
Thus, although faculty involvement in 
theme-based communities should help 
some first-years feel at home, it is only 
one, not the, solution to the problem.

Election 2008: Making sense of decision-making
(jLVolume102,
YSAKDW BRDPWMZCWDM
In the wake of Super Tuesday, 
the advice Im about to offer you 
regarding the election process is 
the same as what I would tell 
you about college  beware of 
posers.
Since the Kennedy-Nixon 
debates, broadcast media has 
played an increasingly influen
tial role in presidential elections. 
Major news stations run hours of 
coverage featuring little-known 
anchors and academic celebrities 
bickering over the merits of dif
ferent candidates and the gener
alized sentiments of vast popula
tions of voters. Ninety-nine per
cent of the time, these qualified 
individuals predict a) things we 
already know or b) things that 
turn out to be dead wrong.
The results of Super Tuesday 
werent particularly shocking. 
Hillary and Barack are still neck 
and neck; McCain dominated on 
the Republican side, as expected. 
Meanwhile, did anyone predict 
that Huckabee would win West 
Virginia, or that Romney would
drop out of the race? What dif
ference would the articulation 
of those predictions have even 
made?
Instead of truly trying to call 
the shots, the so-called experts 
that networks chose to televise 
hide behind sweeping generaliza
tions that are so vague that they 
may or may not be true, or even 
able to be proven. Think about 
how, nine times out of 10, your 
horoscope is just general enough 
to be true  for every single per
son whose birthday is between 
July 23 and Aug. 22, for example. 
Over and over again, weve heard 
how Hillary is carrying the Latino 
vote, as if all 16 million Latinos in 
the United States with the right 
to vote are pulling for Hillary. 
Personally, Im waiting to hear 
whos supposed to be carrying 
the white, female vote, so I can 
figure out who Im supposed to be 
voting for when the Pennsylvania 
primary rolls around on April 22.
Earlier in the election, the 
media took a more discrete role. 
Simply by whom they decided 
to cover, networks were able to 
influence who stayed in the race 
and who would be forced to pull 
out. For example, at a time when 
polls showed that Ron Paul was 
supported by 10 percent of the
American voter population, he 
was getting very little media 
coverage. Though he had strong 
grassroots support, this did not 
allow him to broadcast messages 
to millions of homes through
out the nation. Without media 
coverage, there was no chance 
that Paul would be able to stand 
up to the forces of Clinton or 
Obama, whose incessant teleLike it or not, mass media plays 
a crucial role in the dissemination 
of information to the public, no 
matter how biased, subjective, or 
just plain wrong it may be. And its 
not just CNN  television shows 
like The Daily Show, The Colbert 
Report, Saturday Night Live, and 
the like are all responsible for 
presenting various political view
points for public consumption,
Problem is, an opinion cant be 
based on gut feelings alone.
vised appearances have escalated 
them to mega-celebrity status.
This is the point at which I 
would tell you to turn off the 
media, burn an American flag, 
and think for yourself  but Im 
not going to do that. True, just 
as weve been taught not to pla
giarize in a paper, weve learned 
never to take someones opinion 
and make it our own. Problem 
is, an opinion cant be based on 
gut feelings alone, or how much 
you like women or black people. 
An opinion needs to be informed. 
And where does one usually get 
this information? The media.
even if they are blatantly satirical. 
For every broadcast, every news
paper, and every blog, theres 
a different temperature of the 
political climate, a different sum
mary of events, a different agen
da. News media arent presenting 
these views to tell you to think 
exactly what they think  theyre 
putting in your hands what they 
think is factual, well-reported 
information in hopes that youll 
consider it as one among many 
perspectives that shape your indi
vidual political viewpoint.
Exactly how one goes about 
forming his or her own opinion is
another matter all together. The 
first step is to become an active 
listener. Never absorb a news 
broadcast and take that stations 
views as your own without 
questioning them or verifying 
their facts with another source. 
More sources means more var
ied viewpoints, which will pro
vide enough ammo for you to 
be able to truly support your 
beliefs, whatever they are. And 
dont just look at sources you 
agree with  watch Fox News, 
even if you hate it; check out 
candidates campaign websites, 
in which they plug their choices, 
as well as other outside sources 
that rip them apart. Beware of 
so-called experts who are run
ning off at the mouth every time 
you turn on the television, and 
trust the numbers instead.
Above all, educate yourself 
and trust what you think. After 
all, youre not Anderson Cooper. 
Youre not Bill OReilly. Youre 
you. News media may play a 
major part in deciding the out
come of the election, but they 
cant cast your vote for you. So 
dont let them.

opinion.
Fashion Week takes haute-couture mainstream
ZOASWTA ZRSRBRM
Its Fashion Week. The days are 
cold, the models are hot, and, most 
importantly, the clothes are fierce.
(Well okay, it was last week  
but close enough.)
The annual Mercedes-Benz 
Fashion Week in Bryant Park in 
New York City showcased work by 
all kinds of designers. The event 
demonstrated that fashion has 
evolved from a privilege for the 
elite to a commonplace among all 
types of people. New designers 
with a myriad of different takes 
on the art form that is fashion 
are emerging everywhere. These 
new brands have diversified the 
market, making fashion incred
ibly mainstream, while singlehandedly capturing the attention 
of a wider audience.
I know it seems funny to be 
surprised at fashion becom
ing mainstream. Isnt that what 
fashion is  clothing for our 
everyday lives? But once upon 
a time, the clothing from New 
York Fashion Week was for the 
elite. Those who could afford 
it or those who cared enough 
to pay attention to it were the 
only people who knew what was 
hot for the season, long before it 
trickled down to Macys. Now, 
teenagers are wearing Diane Von 
Furstenberg; moms are sporting 
Stella McCartney; and Lagerfeld, 
Galliano, and Balenciaga are 
household names. Even mention
ing the words haute couture 
doesnt illicit strange looks from 
non-fashionites.
In fact, the entire fashion 
industry has become incred
ibly diversified. No longer is the 
market dominated by the typi
cal Im-wearing-this-truly-uglydress-that-cost-more-than-yourcar type of clothing. Nor is it 
marked by outrageous outfits tied
to exotic European names whose 
correct pronunciations youre 
scared to even guess (Who knew 
its pronounced Zhee-von-she, 
not Gi-ven-chy?). The fashion 
market has seen an upswing of 
clothing for the so-called com
mon man, and now, Bryant Park 
acts as a showcase for new artists 
with fresh looks. Brands like Sean 
John and Betsey Johnson have 
very common, urban looks, and 
thus appeal to a broader audi
ence.
Truthfully, I have mixed feel
ings about brands like Sean John 
being in Bryant Park. It just seems 
to be somewhat out of place in 
terms of style when compared 
to the designs of, say, Zac Posen. 
At the same time, I enjoy the 
idea that something so different 
from everything else on the run
way can actually thrive during 
Fashion Week.
Technically, we cant discrimi
nate, because fashion is a form of 
expression. Its just that members 
of the so-called urban subculture 
express themselves in a different 
way than traditional designers 
might. I like that some of the 
newer brands break away from 
the traditional haute couture that 
people are used to, but Im not a 
huge fan of seeing the clothing of 
the masses on the runway. I think 
fashion is supposed to be a fan
tasy and an art form. A lot of the 
things that appear on the runway 
are seemingly unwearable, but 
may give rise to major trends, and 
thus become a wearable reality 
for everyday people.
I must admit, however, that 
Rock & Republic, which is a little 
punk, a little urban, and a little 
couture all at once, is fantastic. 
It is easily one of my favorite 
brands to watch for and fanta
size that I have enough money to 
buy. The line features mens and 
womens wear with dark denim 
washes, leather jackets with furlined hoods, and bold colors like 
blood red and regal purple. Last 
week, Rock & Republic showed
draped satins in sexy cuts, fulllength dresses with wide belts 
at the waist, and, of course, 
leather and hardware accents. 
It is definitely edgy and fun, 
but still high-fashion. Michael 
Knight, a contestant from Project 
Runways third season, also has a 
mainstream-meets-couture thing 
going that I think is amazing. He 
experiments with mixing pro
vocative silhouettes and sophis
ticated folds, with bold patterns 
and colors like plaid and canary 
yellow.
I think the designs that merge 
the two ends of the spectrum 
(commonality and extravagance) 
are the best. These designs are 
innovative; they put a new spin
on something traditional. They 
also seem to be a little more uni
versal, appealing to many more 
consumers. Real people, rather 
than just models and the super 
elite, can actually see themselves 
in these clothes.
The onset of designs that appeal 
to the actual masses (as opposed 
to the more fashionably-inclined) 
eliminates the prevalence of the 
trickle down effect as well. 
Where it would have once taken 
at least three months for 2006s 
wide-belt look to make its way to 
the Targets and Wal-Marts of the 
world, the effect is now nearly 
instantaneous. Now, were seeing 
styles come straight off the run
way and into the closets of many.
Lizzee Solomon/Art Editor
Fashion has taken a turn for 
the best. Designers are appeal
ing to more people, and new tal
ent is emerging everyday, keep
ing the market young, fresh, 
and exciting. Now everyone can 
enjoy fashion to some degree. 
The differences in the styles of 
each person show that a diversi
fied fashion market is a neces
sity; no one wants to look like a 
clone. New looks are created all 
the time, and there is hope for 
anyone with a dream of design
ing, no matter what their style 
is, to succeed.

reform and 
+/- grading
^CL
ZEHG IEUG,VJou n AdU sHUG
Hey Tartans,
After about four months of 
work, our elections reform 
initiative has come full cir
cle. This past week, Adi and I 
received approval for our policy 
changes from the Undergradu
ate Student Senate and the 
Graduate Student Assembly. 
This new document is a signifi
cant jump in the right direction, 
and we will continue improving 
it to create a more all-encompassing policy.
With these changes in place, 
we hope that the next round 
of elections will run much 
smoother than they did last 
year. We should never again see 
a summer without a permanent 
student body president, vicepresident for finance, and un
dergraduate Senate in place.
I want to publicly acknowl
edge all the help we received 
throughout this process from the 
ad-hoc Elections Reform Com
mittee, which was composed 
of former GSA President Beth 
Ayers, current GSA President 
Patrick Kelley, Representatives 
Ruth Poproski, Paul Enders, and 
Aleecia McDonald, Undergradu
ate Student Senate Chairman 
Jared Itkowitz, Senator Sudeep 
Paul, Vice-President for Finance 
Joel Bergstein, Director of Stu
dent Activities Gina Casalegno, 
Coordinator of Student Activi
ties Kaycee Palko, and thirdfloor miracle-worker Meg Rich
ards.
This week also provided us 
with a valuable discussion at 
the first installment of the Sen
ate Spotlight Series, in which 
the student government invited 
members of the Carnegie Mellon 
community to voice their opin
ions on the proposed grading 
policy changes: the faculty-sug
gested, university-wide move to 
+/- grading; and the motion to 
enable first-semester first-years 
to operate on a pass/fail basis 
for their classes.
Attendees shared their ques
tions and opinions, leading 
to better ideas. I would like 
to thank all the students who 
came.
Finally, to all those trying to 
find a job, I hope the EOC proved 
fruitful to your aspirations. 
Whether its an internship or a 
full-time gig youre looking for, 
hopefully you can reflect well 
on your experiences at Carn
egie Mellon and how they have 
prepared you for that next step.
If theres something missing 
from your Carnegie Mellon ex
perience, tell me about it  its 
possible that something can be 
done to make things more suit
able for you.
As always, you can e-mail me 
at cmu5@cmu.edu.

pleted the sweep by winning 8-3 
at number-three doubles.
The Carnegie Mellon womens 
tennis team enjoyed a successful 
weekend as well, beating Robert 
Morris 9-0 Sunday. The Tartans 
gave up just five games to the vis
iting Colonials in winning 76-5 
in total games to improve to 4-2 
in dual play. Senior Amy Staloch 
joined sophomore Alisa Liebow
itz and first-years Jennifer Chui, 
Danielle Rosenfeld, Brooke Loar,
and Ashley Herrick in sweeping 
the singles positions. In addition, 
Liebowitz, Loar, and Rosenfeld 
all double bageled their'opponents, 6-0, 6-0. Herrick joined 
up with first-year Kelly Hart and 
Loar with junior Kelly Nakamura 
to win both of their doubles 
matches by a combined score of
16-1. Rosenfeld and Liebowitz 
won number-three doubles by 
default.
Though the team dominated 
the courts Sunday, newcomer
Kelly Hart stressed the impor
tance of staying determined.
It was a good match. They are 
a Division I team," so its a good 
win, but even when we knew we 
would win, it is important to stay 
focused on the match and play 
well, she said. We were able to 
try a bunch of new formations 
too.
Both tennis teams have a break 
before their next matches two

Womens basketball loses in Chicago, St. Louis
RAE WEN SHEE
Junior Staffwriter
Swim and diving in UAA
Poor shooting cost the 
Carnegie Mellon womens 
basketball team two matches 
in the past week; the team lost 
to the Washington University 
(Mo.) Bears 37-64 Friday and 
to the University of Chicago Ma
roons 38-67 Sunday. Carnegie 
Mellon is now 7-13 for the year 
and 0-9 in University Athletic 
Association (UAA) play. The 
Bears improve to 14-5 and 6-2 
in the UAA, and the Maroons 
improve to 15-5 and 6-3, 
respectively.
Against the Bears, the 
Tartans got off to an ener
getic start, making three of 
four shot attempts. One was 
a three-pointer by sophomore 
guard Paige Williamson that 
leveled things up at 11-11 
with 13:46. left in the half. In 
the next five-minute span, 
however, Carnegie Mellon 
seemed to run out of gas, as the 
team missed six straight shots 
and committed six turnovers. 
Meanwhile,Washingtoncontinued 
to play well as the Bears made 
five of eight shots, including 
three treys, to take advantage 
of the situation and run out to a 
quick 15-point lead.
Although junior forward Rachelle Roll did halt the Bears 
run with a layup around the 
eight-minute mark, it took 
four and a half minutes before 
the Tartans managed to score 
again. As a result, the Bears 
were able to extend their lead to 
as many as 23 points in the first 
half. At halftime, the score was 
56-22, in favor of Wash. U.
In the second half, the Bears 
pushed their lead to 56-22 as 
they quickly sank seven of their 
first eight shots from the field. 
Wash. U. finished with a 49.1 
percent field goal percentage, 
while the Tartans made a sea
son-low 21.3 percent of their 
shot attempts.
Tartan junior guard Corey 
Innes led all scorers with 13 
points, including three threepointers, while Roll led all play
ers with 11 rebounds. Zoe Unruh led the Bears with 12 points 
while Shanna-Lei Decanay and 
Janice Evans scored 10 points 
apiece.
In the game against the Ma
roons Sunday, Carnegie Mellon 
was again troubled by poor 
shooting as the team shot a 
mere 14.8 percent from the field 
during the first 20 minutes and 
trailed 33-13 at the half. Al
though their shooting improved 
to 33.3 percent (including two 
three-pointers) in the second 
half, and they went on a small 
run whereby they scored five 
points off six Maroon turnovers, 
the deficit was just too large to
overcome. The Tartans eventu
ally fell 67-38 to University of 
Chicago.
Both games were very hard 
fought, junior guard Ashley 
Rothwell said. We played hard, 
but its always more difficult to 
play on the road. Furthermore, 
our players were plagued with 
sicknesses, and its unfortunate 
that we now have to deal with 
dwindling numbers as well. We 
have a very talented team. We 
just have to find the combination that wins games and con
tinue with it.
Junior guard Rachelle Roll 
just missed a double-double 
with 10 points and nine re
bounds, while senior guard 
Leah Feola contributed nine 
points in the loss. Chicago was 
led by Nicaya Rapiers 10 points, 
while three other players scored 
nine apiece.

York University at 6 p.m on

Mens tennis defeats West Virginia Wesleyan Friday
LAUREN WINCHESTER
Junior Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon
swimming and diving teams will 
be competing in the 2008 Univer
sity Athletic Association (UAA) 
championships Feb. 20-23. The 
meet is hosted by the Univer
sity of Rochester at the Webster 
Aquatic Center in Webster, N.Y. 
Teams participating include 
Brandeis University, Case West
ern Reserve University, Emory 
University, New York University, 
University of Chicago, Univer
sity of Rochester, and Washing
ton University in St. Louis. At the 
2007 UAA championships, the 
Carnegie Mellon mens team fin
ished in third while the womens 
team placed fourth. This year 
both teams are looking to place 
well again.
Below are some predictions 
concerning the success of both 
the men and womens swimming 
and diving teams in the coming 
UAA championship, based on 
careerand season-long records.
Top contenders on the mens 
team include seniors Patrick 
Snyder and Michael Bailey in the 
50- and 100-yard freestyles and 
junior Tom McConnell in the
distance freestyle events. Led 
by sophomore John Johnson, 
four Carnegie Mellon swimmers 
have potential to place high in 
the 200-yard backstroke. Sopho
more Jason Huber is seeded top 
three in the 100- and 200-yard 
breaststrokes.
On the womens team, firstyear Molly Evans should be the 
easy pick for UAA champion 
in the backstroke events, as 
well as a top contender in the 
200-yard freestyle and distance 
freestyle events should she swim 
in them; she would also likely 
place in the top three in IM 
events. Senior Lauren Connell 
has the potential to place in the 
top three in the sprint freestyle 
events, and sophomore Sara 
Andrews could be in the top 
three in the 100-yard breast
stroke. Finally, the 200-yard but
terfly should be a good event for 
the Tartans, with senior Anna 
Kochalko and first-year Rebecca 
Ussai vying for top places.
We are starting to get really 
excited for UAAs. Everyone 
has put in so much hard work 
throughout the season and we 
are ready for all the hard work to 
payoff. I cant wait to see how fast 
we can swim, Kochalko said.
Track runs at Bucknell
TRACK, fromA12
competition in UAA has became 
a lot stronger this year, to defend 
our title well have to get much 
better, Tang said.
Sophomore Chris Bogie 
(52.54) placed 11th in the 
400-meter dash. In the 
500-meter dash, junior Craig 
Hahn finished 11th overall with 
a time of 1:10.85.
The mens team also stood 
out in the jumping events. Tang 
(6.56 meters) led the team in 
the long jump with a fifth-place 
finish. First-years Essein Ohues, 
Pat OBrien, and Nick Hagelin 
finished in the top five in. the 
high jump. Ohues placed fourth 
with 1.89 meters, and OBrien 
and Hagelin tied for fifth with 
1.79 meters.
In the long jump, OBrien 
jumped 13.05 meters to take 
sixth place. Tang (12.50 meters) 
and Ohues (12.26 meters) took 
11th and 13th, respectively.
Sophomore James Hulley 
threw for 13.46 meters, finishing 
ninth in the weight throw. Junior 
Chris Fornatro took 10th in both 
the weight throw and shot put 
with 13.33 and 12.07 meters, 
respectively. In the pole vaults, 
sophomore Chris Bridgman 
placed eighth with 4.20 meters.
On the womens team, 
the ladies dominated the
800-meter run with three run
ners in the top 10. Sophomore 
Diane Mattingly finished fourth 
with a time of 2:23.58. Senior 
Ashley Bakelmun and sophomore 
Crystal Lee Pow took eighth and 
ninth with times of 2:31.12 and
2:32.58, respectively.
The team did well. I feel 
that we held up well against 
Division I competition, said 
Lee Pow. Were looking strong 
and showing potential for the 
UAA [championships].
In the 400-meter dash, 
senior Shauna Ormon placed 
15th with a time of 1:03.14. 
First-year Laura McKee (3:10.65) 
took eighth in the 1000-meter 
run, and junior Chrissy Krutz 
(21:00.74) finished 16th in the 
5000-meter run.
Junior Sami Simmons jumped 
10.40 meters for 13th place 
in the triple jump. First-year 
Morgan Faer finished 10th in the 
shot put with 9.49 meters.
The level of competition 
was much higher than at our 
previous meets. It was a really 
good experience to run with 
athletes that were much better 
than me.... Having competed in 
two Division I meets in a row 
here, Im no longer on the radar, 
Faer stated in an e-mail.
Ive realized that if I want 
to be in a position to actually 
compete with these girls, I have 
to stop relying on my past ex
perience and talent and start 
working out of my comfort zone.
This means we have to work 
that much harder to overcome 
this. It can be frustrating going 
up again athletes that are that 
much better than us. We are a 
very young team. Im very ex
cited to see how we grow with 
one another and see what were 
like in a year or two, she said.
The teams compete Friday at 
Baldwin-Wallace College.

The Carnegie Mellon mens 
and womens tennis teams had 
a terrific weekend in the second 
week of their spring season, go
ing undefeated in all 27 matches 
played. The men defeated Divi
sion II West Virginia Wesleyan 
Bobcats on Saturday and Division 
I Robert Morris on Sunday and 
the women triumphed over Rob
ert Morris on Sunday, as well.
The mens team began the 
weekend on the right foot, de
feating West Virginia Wesleyan 
to improve its season record to
5-1. The Tartans, ranked 14th
in the nation in Division III ten
nis, swept the Bobcats across the 
board to complete their second 
undefeated match of the season.
Senior Andrew Clearfield and 
sophomores James Muliawan, 
Jon Spero, and Ravi Raghavan all 
were victorious in their singles 
matches with Spero overcom
ing a first-set loss before coming 
back and winning in three sets.
Muliawan later teamed up with 
fellow sophomore Nikola Ljuboja 
to defeat the Bobcats numberone doubles team 8-4.
I think we played pretty well 
this weekend, Muliawan said. 
As a team I think we could have 
played better doubles. Person
ally, I would have liked to hit 
my first serves more often and 
I would like to hit with a little 
more depth.
Muliawan has set high goals for 
himself and the team this season 
as well. As a team, we can defi
nitely improve our national rank
ing to around eighth this year, 
he said. For myself, I would like 
to get to seventh in doubles and 
20th in singles. I want the team 
to do well, and then anything 
else is a bonus.
Raghavan went on to partner 
with first-year Bobby MacTaggart, who also won a singles 
match earlier in the day; the two 
won at number-two doubles, 8-2.
First-year Alex Nemerov was 
the last to have a double dose of 
matches Saturday, following up 
his 6-1, 6-1 singles victory with 
an 8-2 win at number-three dou
bles with junior Yiran Liu.
The mens team hosted the 
Robert Morris Colonials and 
emerged victorious Sunday, 
sweeping each position yet again 
to improve to 6-1 on the year.
Muliawan, Nemerov, Clear
field, MacTaggart, and Spero all 
won their second singles matches 
of the weekend with none of the 
players giving up more than six 
games to their opponents.

Junior Stafjwriter
With three impressive 
seasons under her belt, recent 
University Athletic Association 
(UAA) Player of the Week 
Amy Staloch, a senior, looks 
forward to finishing her 
collegiate tennis career on a 
high note. UAA Rookie of the 
Year (2004-2005), UAA MVP 
(2006-2007), and multiple AllUAA and All-American honors 
are just a few accomplishments 
on Stalochs resume.
The Carnegie Mellon 
womens tennis team is 2-0 
as its players start their spring 
season. As things get under
way, The Tartan sat down 
with Staloch to learn about 
life as an athlete, student, and 
almost-graduate of Carnegie 
Mellon.
Tartan: How long have you 
been playing tennis?
Staloch: I have been
playing tennis since I was 
three but didnt take it 
seriously until I was about 12.
T: Do you enjoy traveling for 
matches? What is your favorite 
part about being on the road?
S: I like traveling for ten
nis and seeing different parts 
of the country. My favorite 
part about being on the road 
is bonding with the team. We 
have a lot of fun on trips. My 
second favorite part about be
ing on the road is we always go 
to Olive Garden and I get the 
Tour of Italy.
T: Was tennis a
deciding factor in your choice 
to come to Carnegie Mellon?
S: The team was definitely 
a deciding factor in choosing
CMU. The girls on the team 
and the coach were amazing, 
and I knew I could play. What 
else interested me in the school 
was its location, great academ
ics, and the feeling I got when 
I visited.
T: What are some of your 
individual goals? What are 
some team goals that have 
been set for the season?
S: My individual goal for 
this season is to always have 
a really good attitude on the 
court and to get into better 
shape so I dont get tired in 
long matches or long tour
naments. Those are the two 
things that I think hold me 
back in matches. I want the 
team to always play with 
confidence and class and to 
hopefully make it'to nationals.
T: What is the best part 
about being a student athlete?
S: The best part is having 
something outside of school to 
try really hard at and be suc
cessful at. Its another place to 
put my efforts.
T: Where is your favorite 
place to go on vacation?
S: I always go different 
places so I dont have a favor
ite. Anywhere with water.
T: What do you like the most 
about your major? Is there 
anything that you wish you 
could have studied as well?
S: I like that its a major that 
I can use to do a lot of different 
things. Its pretty practical. 
My humanities depth was in 
history, and I always enjoyed 
those classes.
T: Is there anything that sur
prised you about coming to 
school in Pittsburgh?
S: Several of my friends 
were from Pittsburgh so they 
were die-hard Steelers fans 
and said weird words and 
had funny sentence structures 
sometimes.
T: Where do you see your
self in 10 years? Do you think 
tennis will always be a part of 
your life?
S: I think Ill always play 
tennis. I am really going to 
miss the competitive tennis. 
Its going to be really difficult 
for me to get used to social 
tennis.
T: What year of college has 
been your favorite?
S: All of them! I feel like 
every year I get to meet more 
people and get a little wiser 
and more mature.

Mens basketball falls to two UAA competitors
CASEY TAYLOR
Stafjwriter
It was a disappointing week
end for the Carnegie Mellon 
mens basketball team, drop
ping both games in Chicago and 
St. Louis and essentially falling 
out of University Athletic Asso
ciation (UAA) contention. The 
Tartans now stand at 3-6 in the 
league, reversing all of the mo
mentum they built up with two 
huge league wins last weekend. 
The road has ailed Carnegie Mel
lon all year in the UAA, where 
the team has managed only one 
away win in Cleveland against 
the Case Western squad.
After the Tartans defeated 
themby 31 points last Sunday, the 
Bears of Washington University 
(Mo.), now ranked ninth in the 
nation, got their revenge Fri
day night. Despite a career-high
19 points from sophomore Jack 
Anderson, who shot well from 
the three-point line, the Tartans 
were unable to finish the game 
off. Carnegie Mellon held a twopoint lead after two free throws 
from senior Geoff Kozak with 
about nine minutes left, but the 
Bears unleashed a three-point 
barrage to pull ahead for good. 
Free throws and turnovers in the 
last couple of minutes finalized 
Washingtons 11-point victory.
Though the final box score 
reveals that both teams shot vir
tually the same field-goal per# 
centage, had very few turnovers 
between them, and hit high per
centages from the free-throw 
line, Kozak pointed to another 
significant category.
Three-point shooting, he 
said. Compared with last week, 
when we held them to 1-12 shoot
ing, they went off this week. We
just didnt get the stops down the 
stretch, that we needed to.
While Kozak may be right, 
the even statistical match-up 
still reveals a weakness that has 
plagued Carnegie Mellon for the 
last several years. In tight games 
in which execution and efficiency 
matter, such as the losses to 
Rochester on Dec. 1 and to NYU 
on Jan. 20., the Tartans have dif
ficulty on both sides of the ball.
The Tartans are trying to get 
past the weekend and start focus
ing on the future. Junior forward 
Jon Wolleben was quick to point 
out that the season isnt over yet.
Weve still got five more 
games to go, said Wolleben, who 
has been providing an important 
spark off the bench for Carnegie 
Mellon. We have to finish out 
strong.
The Tartans can still salvage 
their season, especially if they
manage to pull together some 
tough victories over the final five 
games. At 13-7, if the Tartans 
can manage a win streak to end 
the season, they could be looking 
at an NCAA tournament berth. 
With last Fridays win over the 
nations top team Washington 
University and December win 
over 12th-ranked Capital, the 
Tartans have some impressive 
victories on their resume.
We beefed up our strength 
of schedule this year for a 
reason, said junior center Rob 
Pearson. We played some tough 
non-conference opponents and 
earned a few important wins. 
Plus, this year, the UAA is so 
strong that any win looks good.
The Tartans are on the 
road again next weekend, 
when they face off against 
New York University and 
Brandeis, on Friday and Sunday.

HOUSING NEWS
Mudge House will become an all first-year building as of next year. Current residents, however, will be able to retain their rooms for the coming year as the building transitions.
Changes in first-year housing
Over the past few years, the university has been 
increasing its commitment to first-year housing, 
claiming that it is easier for first-years to assimilate 
into the Carnegie Mellon environment if they are 
part of a close-knit, active living community. As of 
next year, the following residences will become all 
first-year housing:
Boss House will be an all first-year building.
 Current residents will not be able to retain 
their rooms and must enter the general se
lection process to choose other campus 
housing.
Scobell House will begin transitioning into an all 
first-year building.
 Current secondand third-floor residents 
can retain their rooms or pick a different 
room in the building.
 Current groundand first-floor residents can 
retain their rooms if they are singles; those 
in doubles can choose building retention and 
choose a different room on one of the upper 
floors of Scobell.
Mudge House will begin transitioning into an all 
first-year building.
 Current residents in A tower (all floors), 
B2, B3, C2, and C3 can retain their current 
rooms.
 Current residents in singles in BB, Bl, CB, 
and Cl can retain their current rooms.
 Current residents retaining their current 
room can pull in a roommate who is also a 
Mudge resident.
 All Mudge residents can participate in build
ing retention to choose a different room in 
Mudge.-
All residents in Scobell and Mudge who choose to 
retain for this coming year will not be able to retain 
their rooms in Room Draw 2009 and must enter the 
general selection process.
Other first-year housing areas (not available for 
retention or selection):
 Donner House  all floors
 Hamerschlag House  all floors
 Morewood Gardens E Tower  all floors
 New House  all floors
 Henderson House  first floor
 McGill House  first floor
 Welch House  first floor
Special interest housing and group housing
Group or special interest hous
ing is the perfect option for stu
dents wary of new neighbors or 
interested in living with a large 
number of friends.
Group housing allows groups 
of six to 16 students to apply 
for a block of rooms, which will 
most likely be in one of the Oak
land Community Apartments 
buildings (Cathedral Mansions, 
Fairfax, or Webster).
Groups should select a repre
sentative to communicate with 
Housing about available blocks 
and other logistics. The repre
sentative can select the block 
of rooms once he or she has 
collected signed proxy forms 
from the other group members. 
Groups that cannot find a block 
that suits them can switch back 
to the general selection process.
Groups must apply by March
5 and must select their accom
modations on March 18.
Another possibility for groups 
of individuals who want to build 
their own living communities 
is special interest housing. The 
deadline for special interest 
housing has already passed; 
however, those interested 
should consider it for next year.
Special interest housing is 
slightly more involved than 
group housing. A group of stu
dents must fill out an applica
tion explaining the members 
shared purpose and how they 
plan to impact the community 
in which they live. Students can 
be united through academics or 
extracurriculars (i.e., a group of 
art majors or a group of students 
on the same intramural team) 
or by selecting a theme that all 
members are passionate about. 
Special interest housing areas 
are larger apartments or suites
in other buildings. Current ar
eas are in Doherty Apartments 
(five people), Margaret Mor
rison Apartments (two apart
ments of eight people each), 
Morewood Gardens (one suite 
of six people and another of 10 
people), Mudge (five people), 
Resnik (two suites of eight peo
ple each), and Shady Oak (six 
people).

McGill
Men. Cant live with em, 
cant live without em. But you 
could always move to McGill, 
the only all-female residence 
on campus. McGill features 
three floors with prime-style 
dorms. The rooms are not 
especially large, but theyre 
clean, and  hey  theyre 
bigger than New House dorms. 
Plus, bathrooms are cleaned 
weekly by the housekeeping 
staff.
The atmosphere in McGill
is friendly and very social  
almost like being in a sorority, 
but without the dues. (Fortu
nately, it is actually an urban 
myth that under Pennsylva
nia state law, eight or more 
women in one house is consid
ered a brothel, so dont worry 
if youve heard that around 
campus.)
In addition, plan to get rid 
of your meal plan, or at least 
use less of it while in McGill; 
the trucks prove to be a great
alternative to campus food. 
When choosing McGill, dont 
think about the fact that its all 
girls; think about the friendly 
atmosphere. And if you do get 
tired of all that estrogen, its 
simply a hop, skip, and a jump 
over to Boss, Hamerschlag, or 
Scobell. Those Chatham girls 
would probably kill to live 
there.

Resnik and West Wing
Four towers, seven floors, 
one convenient place to live. 
Such a large number of stu
dents are housed in Morewood 
that youll most likely end up 
in proximity to one or several 
people you already know. With 
the exception of the Fraternity 
Quadrangle, Morewood is the 
closest on-campus living on 
the opposite side of Forbes.
Morewood offers singles, 
doubles, and triples, some with 
their own bathrooms or shar
ing a bathroom between them, 
and others grouped suite-style, 
meaning that multiple rooms
share one bathroom in a com
mon area. Its best to avoid 
a suite with two rooms con
nected only by a bathroom, 
since its not uncommon to 
wind up locked out of the 
bathroom connecting the two 
rooms if one of your suitemates 
forgets to unlock both doors.
Most room options are siz
able and accommodating, but 
then theres the occasional 
L-shaped room or bowling-lane 
room (long and narrow). These 
rooms suffice, but dont choose 
one if you have other options 
 it will be cramped and awk
ward. Thus, make sure you ac
tually see the room you want 
before you sign up for it.
However, the parking lot 
outside Morewood and the 
frats across the street can make 
for some noisy nights, depend
ing on the direction your room 
faces. Also, some students who 
live in rooms facing Morewood 
E Tower may feel like they per
petually sriiell like The Under
ground.
Kristen Lukiewski contrib

Suites, available in both build
ings, vary in size and can acco
modate anywhere from one to 
eight residents. A typical suite 
will house five residents with two 
doubles, one single, one bath
room, and one furnished lounge 
space.
Common complaints among 
residents include the march
ing band, which practices on 
the football field some Saturday 
mornings.
John Gross contributed to this 
article.
Welch is another Hill house, 
but it distinguishes itself by hav
ing a 24-hour quiet rule. This 
often means that Welch attracts 
students who prefer to keep to 
themselves and are less inter
ested in creating a community 
atmosphere. However, the at
mosphere seems to suit students 
who want a comfortable home 
and dont want to be distracted 
by noise. The rooms are
and bathrooms are spacious. 
Welch was renovated in 2001.

Style of Housing: Apartment  
one-bedroom (two students), 
two-bedroom (four students),

Extra: The Frame, a small stu
dent-run art gallery, is located 
on the first floor.
One of the few locations on 
campus that offers apartment 
living, Woodlawn is a very 
small building outside of the 
heart of campus. Not far from 
the Hill, Woodlawn is closest to 
Roselawn Houses and Doherty 
Apartments. Though it has few 
amenities, the accommodations 
are quite nice for on-campus 
apartment living. The rooms are 
large, making the apartments 
feel spacious  especially the 
two seven-person apartments, 
each of which contains two 
kitchens and two bathrooms.
Students seem to like the social 
atmosphere in Woodlawn. While
the building has no lounge, RAs 
often hold small events in their 
own apartments. In addition, 
theres only one main hallway 
so students often run into each 
other. And the buildings small 
occupancy often leads to a closeknit group of residents.
Woodlawn has its downsides, 
though. The buildings declining 
condition  poor heating, peel
ing paint, drafty windows  and 
lack of common space might be a 
deal-breaker.

a tip: The apartments on the

larger than the entry-level 
apartments.
Unfortunately, Doherty 
residents are not very neigh

Each apartment in Marga
ret Morrison has two floors, a 
kitchen/living area on the first 
floor, and then, two bedrooms 
and a bathroom either upstairs

sit outside the Margaret Mor
rison courtyard, which offers a 
space to sit, relax, and socialize. 
The courtyard is shared with 
the sororities and the fraternity 
Sig Tau. Residents privacy is 
respected and students mainly
socialize behind apartment 
doors, but Margaret Morrison 
RAs frequently organize social 
events for residents to attend if 
they choose.
Margaret Morrison offers 
students more space than a 
dorm room as well as a quick 
walk to campus. All apartments 
were fully renovated two sum
mers ago. However, the setup of 
Margaret Morrison makes for a 
tighter squeeze than students
who live in the Oakland Com
munity Apartments. The living 
room is not large enough for a 
full-size couch, and the living 
area and kitchen are combined, 
making it difficult for students 
to cook, eat, do homework, and 
relax all in the same space.

There is the slight drawback of having to clean

soap, yourselves. But if youre a neat person, get 
along with the people you live with, and would 
rather do things yourself than wait on pending 
maintenance requests, its a good choice. In addi
tion, Roselawn is a good place to be if youre not 
on a meal plan; cooking is a lot easier when you 
dont need to walk down a floor and across three 
towers to do it.
Unfortunately, its pretty difficult to draw a 
Roselawn House through Room Draw. Many of 
the houses are inhabited by teams and organiza
tions, who hold on to them for years. Your best 
bet is getting someone to pull you in.

Pittsburgh natives.
On the downside, Cathedral 
Mansions is old school, from 
the personnel maintaining the

that make frequent pit-stops 
between floors for various 
lengths of time. (Our advice  
take the stairs.) However, the 
apartments have big windows 
and wood floors, and the stoves 
and refrigerators were recently 
replaced. The bathrooms are a 
bit more of an adventure (ceil

The Neville Co-op, officially 
called Neville Apartments, is a 
democratic living community 
for students who are actively 
involved on campus and com
mitted to sustainable living, 
civil equality, and social prog
ress. The Co-op was founded 
by students in 2003. It has no 
RA or housefellow, only a liai
son to the Housing office who 
helps the Co-op solve mainte
nance problems.
The membership fee that Co
op residents pay to live in the 
building pays for weekly din
ners, housekeeping items such 
as detergent, toilet paper, and 
light bulbs, and social events. 
The Co-ops rent is lower than 
comparable campus apart
ments and includes the sum
mer at no extra charge. Though 
the Co-op has been the victim 
of several burglaries in recent 
years, last year new locks were
installed and safety bars were 
placed on the first-floor win
dows.
New members must complete 
an application and interview to 
be considered for the Co-op. 
Members are chosen by their 
demonstrated commitment to 
the Co-ops five ideals, which 
are: environmental awareness, 
democratic processes, racial 
equality, gender equality, and 
equality of sexual orientation. 
All members are expected to 
attend weekly meetings and 
dinners, as well as other Co-op 
events throughout the semes
ter.
Co-op Week, a week of 
events during which students 
can attend events and learn 
more about the co-op before 
they apply, is the week prior to 
Room Draw, so those who apply 
and are not accepted still have 
the opportunity to go through 
Room Draw.

Originally a hotel, Webster 
Hall now houses Carnegie Mel
lon students as well as Univer
sity of Pittsburgh students and 
non-student residents. Webster 
is ideal for independent students; as the building is large, 
Carnegie Mellon apartments 
are scattered around the build
ing, so interaction with the 
community is up to students. 
However, the Webster RAs hold
events throughout the year, in
cluding weekly dinners.
While safety is a concern, 
Wqbster has the strongest secu
rity measures of the Oakland 
community apartments. Inside 
the building, there is a secu
rity guard who watches the 
entrance at night. He, together 
with the electronic key system 
(each student has a key fob 
that, when scanned, opens the 
door to the building), make for 
a safe living community. Resi

OFF-CAMPUS OPTIONS
Shadyside, Squirrel Hill
Squirrel 
Hill
If youve ever wanted to get away from 
the daily grind of Carnegie Mellon and en
ter a living situation that feels more like a 
home than a place you go to do your home
work, you may consider living off-campus. 
And if local color, in your opinion, should 
include people of all ages, not just college 
students (read: Oakland) or middle-aged 
yuppies (read: Shadyside) then you may 
want to make a stop in Squirrel Hill while 
looking for apartments.
Chances are youre already familiar 
with Squirrel Hill. The area is home to 
Giant Eagle, Barnes & Noble, the swanky 
library, and Eat n Park. Squirrel Hill is de
cidedly as vibrant as Oakland, but has less 
dirt and a more diverse crowd. Its as bus
General Oakland apartment information
Amenities and procedures that are common to all 
Oakland community apartments:
 Students have access to transportation to and 
from campus via Escort Services.
 Students can purchase a mailbox to have their
- mail sent directly to the building. All students
can have packages sent directly to the building, 
even if they do not have a mailbox.
 Housing provides furniture and an Ethernet 
router, and Comcast provides cable television.
 To do laundry, students must purchase a $4 
laundry card (available from a machine in the 
laundry rooms) and then add on later with ex
act change. Each load costs $1.25 for washer, 
$1 for dryer.
 If students are locked out of an apartment, 
they can sign out a duplicate key from Housing, 
which they must return by 5 p.m. the next day
 If a student loses his or her original key, or 
fails to return the duplicate key by 5 p.m., the 
locks must be changed, which means that the 
student is charged $60 and all residents must 
visit Housing to pick up new keys (lock-out pro
cedures are also the same for London Terrace, 
Veronica, and Shady Oak).
 Residents of Fairfax and Webster will also be 
charged an additional $25 if they lose their key 
fob and need a new one.
 Generally, Oakland community apartments 
provide plenty of space and privacy for students 
who want to maintain ties to campus, though 
the stratified atmosphere, with students living 
on all different floors, does not promote togeth
erness. To keep students connected, RAs typi
cally organize community events about once a 
week.
tling as Shadyside but lacks the cookiecutter chain establishments. Instead 
of Asian restaurants owned by a group 
called Big Burrito (Shadysides Umi and 
Soba), Squirrel Hill has Bangkok Balcony, 
the New Dumpling House, and the Rose 
Tea Caf. Squirrel Hill is in close proxim
ity to a small shopping district. However, 
while Squirrel Hill has a few bars and res
taurants open late, a party-happy student 
will probably find the atmosphere a little 
sleepy.
Rent for different Squirrel Hill housing 
options varies greatly. Like many com
munities near college campuses, rents 
are still high on the whole, and being one 
street closer to a bus route or farther from
a more dangerous bordering community 
can make all the difference. A good rule 
of thumb is that the closer the place is to 
Forbes and Murray Avenues, the more ex
pensive it is going to be (apartments on 
Darlington Street are very expensive, for 
instance), and the farther down Murray 
Avenue it is, the cheaper it is going to be 
(by the time you get to Forward Avenue 
the rents are drastically lower). Most loca
tions in Squirrel Hill are a brisk 25-min
ute walk to campus.
Although there are fewer apartments to 
be found in Squirrel Hill, they are gener
ally in better condition than their Shady
side counterparts.

campus, youll probably choose to live 
on Wilkins Avenue, Wightman Street, or 
near Murray Avenue between Forbes Ave
nue and Hobart Street. If youd rather the 
shops be a convenient distance, any place 
along Murray Avenue or Shady Avenue is 
a good bet.
In terms of safety, police statistics on 
crime show that the farther south in 
Squirrel Hill you go, the more crime rises, 
but generally speaking, the community is 
a safe one.
Michelle Bova and Selena Beckman-Harned 
contributed to this article.
With its gorgeous architec
ture and chic shopping district, 
Shadyside is a desirable place to 
live. The neighborhoods popu
larity stems from Walnut Street, 
the upscale shopping district, 
as well as its excellent cuisine. 
Nearby Ellsworth Avenue also 
boasts a variety of shops and 
restaurants. Shadyside is home 
to the UPMC Shadyside Hos
pital, Whole Foods, and Giant 
Eagle Market District.
Rent is high, but you can 
find an affordable apartment 
in Shadyside youll just have 
to do some digging. To find 
an apartment in Shadyside, 
look for listings along Negley,
Shadyside
Center, and Fifth avenues. For 
the money-conscious, nearby 
Friendship and Bloomfield tend 
to be more affordable neighbor
hoods, and both are walking 
distance to Shadyside. Friend
ship is home to old Victorian 
houses converted into apart
ments and several coffeeshops 
and restaurants. Bloomfield is 
next to Pittsburghs Little Italy, 
with several excellent restau
rants, and Liberty Avenue, 
which is lined with interesting 
boutiques and coffee shops that 
tend to be more affordable than 
the Walnut Street shops.
Students who live in Shady
side can take advantage of the

Carnegie Mellon shuttle, which 
runs along the neighborhoods 
borders, or walk  campus is 
only a 20-30 minute walk away. 
Students with cars, beware  
parking is more difficult than 
in other neighborhoods.
Shadyside is among the saf
est neighborhoods in Pitts
burgh. If youre worried about 
crime, look for an apartment 
in the southern part of Shady
side  the north borders East 
Liberty and has a much higher 
crime rate.

The Scales of Memory
All-female and -male companies perform together
On Saturday, the Pittsburgh Dance Council, in 
association with the August Wilson Center for 
African-American Culture, presented Les cailles 
de la mmoire (The Scales of Memory) at the 
Byham Theater. The show was a collaborative 
performance between the New York-based 
all-female company Urban Bush Women and the 
Senegal-based all-male Compagnie Jant-Bi. It 
featured seven dancers from each company.
The companies began work on the production 
in December 2005 with a series of creative 
residencies hosted by the Maggie Allesee 
National Center for Choreography at Florida State 
University, the Brooklyn Academy of Music, and 
LEcole des Sables. The show premiered three 
years later, opening last month at the University 
of Florida.
Les cailles de la mmoire focuses on the themes 
of resistance, memory, and love  framing them 
as the common link between the African and 
African-American cultures. The production also 
focuses on gender differences and the differences 
between dancers who share a common ancestry 
but are historically, geographically, and culturally 
divided. These differences become apparent at 
the beginning of the show, when all 14 dancers 
walk slowly forward, shouting their names and 
family histories to the crowd. The show closes 
with a similar act: The dancers shout again and 
unite as one giant voice.
In one of the show's solo skits, an Urban Bush 
Woman dancer moves to the center of the stage. 
She laughs at the word Creole" and twists and 
stomps her body mockingly; she says later, in 
French: I am African. My race is African! And 
you, you are French!" To emphasize her point, 
she hoots and twists in a way that resembles 
tribal battle behavior  using it as a tool against 
the violation of personal identity instead of a 
prelude to a physical battle.
The men of Compagnie Jant-Bi resist against a 
more physical target. Marching in line military 
style, the men line up to use their bright red 
shirts as weapons to fight off invisible flies, 
mosquitoes, implied pursuers, and even each 
other. Running in place, always reaching out 
ahead, they tell the story of a long journey filled 
with peril and enemies through dance. Often 
wild, the dances included flailing, of arms, legs, 
or red shirts.
The dancers from Urban Bush Women were 
unforgiving and powerful on stage. They were 
sexy, proud, strong,, sassy, and funny. They 
succeeded in portraying the African-American 
identity, often snapping their fingers and 
shouting "Whats up? without reserve.
This created a funny contrast with the men 
of Jant-Bi. One dance sequence had both 
groups come together; they slow-danced to a 
Caribbean-influenced dance and fell in love. As 
comedic relief, one man of Jant-Bi, as a man of 
Senegal, pretended to not follow the dance steps. 
This led to him shaking and humping his partner, 
a woman, forcing her to fling him off and angrily 
stand over his body, her foot upon his neck.
Overall, the show was well performed. Although 
some parts were slow, boring, or confusing, Les 
cailles de la mmoire still sent a message and 
succeeded in blending two cultures in a fusion 
of contemporary and traditional dance. Although 
they are of different genders and cultures, the 
men of Jant-Bi and the women of Urban Bush 
Woman share a linked history and identity.
Urban Bush Women was founded in 1984 by 
choreographer Jawole Willa Jo Zollar. Through 
dance, the company aims to reveal the untold 
and undertold histories of disenfranchised 
people, particularly the women of the African 
Diaspora community.
Compagnie Jant-Bi was founded in 1998 by 
choreographer Germaine Acogny. She brought 
together the dancers, who had participated in the 
first professional workshop of the International 
Centre for Traditional and Contemporary African 
Dancers, called LEcole des Sables, in Toubab 
Dialaw, Senegal via her artistic direction. Today, 
Compagnie Jant-Bi continues to work closely 
with the center. The groups main goal is to 
supply African dancers with professional training 
in traditional and contemporary dance.

A main motif of the show was light. At times, 
dancers from both companies reached out to 
a square or circle of light. Their hands were 
spastic and their faces in anguish as they sat 
looking up or down at plain, white light. The 
light was a metaphor for many ideas, from God 
to the memory of better times. The light was 
both positive and negative; sometimes it would 
encourage their dance, other times it would 
throw them to the floor, leaving them to crawl 
away.

Point Park performs Thou Shalt Not
In the wake of Mardi Gras, students in the Conservatory 
Theatre Company at Point Park University performed the 
musical Thou Shalt Not last weekend, with the show's final 
performance on Sunday, Feb. 10. Set in post-WWII New 
Orleans, Thou Shalt Not captures the flavor of the city  
rum out of the bottle, southern accents, and sex, among 
other seasonings. Adapted from the novel Thrse Raquin 
by French writer mile Zola, Thou Shalt Not portrays the 
consequences of adultery, deceit, and other fundamental 
sins. The show features a script by David Thompson, who 
also wrote the new Chicago, and music and lyrics by New 
Orleans native Harry Connick, Jr.
The story begins when Laurent (senior Rich Binning), 
a pianist and former soldier, stumbles upon the Raquin 
house  a combination restaurant and home. The house 
is maintained by Madame Raquin (senior Julie Connors), 
perhaps the typical New Orleans woman, with grace, 
class, and enough balls to put most Yankee boys to shame. 
Laurent takes a liking to Therese Raquin (senior Kirstie 
Cook), a sex-starved belle who appears to be Madame's 
daughter, and unexpectedly reunites with an old friend, 
Camille Raquin (senior Kyle Igneczi), Madame's sickly son.
The night wears on with clamoring and dancing, 
highlighted by Laurents spirited (and suggestive) 
rendition of "While Youre Young," featuring the 
oft-repeated lyric "Love me while you're young!" In this 
scene, Laurent succeeds in winning the girl (and the 
audience) over, only to lose both later in the show. The 
crowd of customers eventually disperses, leaving Laurent 
and Therese alone in the restaurant, where they promptly 
unleash some lip-locking passion. Just when everything 
is going great, Therese reveals that Madame is not her 
mother and  more significantly  Camille is not her
brother: He's her husband. Despite this twist, Laurent and 
Therese proceed to the latter's bedroom, where they break 
a rather significant commandment.
All sinning aside, this coital scene was  from a technical 
standpoint  full of interesting maneuvers. Actors Binning 
and Cook engaged in a rapturous, body-on-body dance 
atop a rotating bed in their underwear. The effect was 
intriguing and certainly memorable, but slightly off the 
mark; the dance was avant-garde and awkward, but not 
exactly sensual.
Days pass and Laurent stays with the family, eventually 
joining Camille and Therese as they hit the town for Mardi 
Gras. Keep in mind, this is the Mardi Gras of 1946, the first 
in four years since the war began  so it's bound to be 
explosive.
Exuberant with bayou energy, Binning, Igneczi, and Cook, 
along with the ensemble, perform the electrifying "Take 
Her To The Madri Gras," which is, amazingly, almost 
difficult to sit through  if only it were acceptable for 
members of the audience to stand up and dance. The 
number climaxes in a burst of purple, green, and gold and 
falling confetti, and it seems the only place the night can 
go is down.
And it does. Laurent, Camille, and Therese settle down for 
a canoe ride on Lake Pontchartrain. Enchanted with the 
moment, Camille sings Tug Boat, a New Orleans-type 
lullaby  but Camille does not stay enchanted for long. 
Abruptly, Laurent stands up in the canoe, knocks Camille 
into the water, and drowns him.
Shattered by the news of her sons death, Madame has a
stroke and is essentially unable to communicate for the 
rest of the show  for the audience, this is devastating, 
as Connors performances were definite high-points in 
the show. The day after the funeral, Laurent embraces 
Therese, aiming to begin their new life together as soon 
as possible. But Therese insists that the couple wait a year 
before getting married (or getting intimate).
One year later, a newly wed Laurent and Therese attempt 
to do the deed in the bed Therese used to share with 
Camille (where they've done it once before), but neither 
can stop thinking about the deceased. The audience 
cant either, as it happens, as Igneczi returns to the 
stage dressed in ghostly white and ready to punish the 
wrongdoers. As the stunted spouses sit terrified in bed, 
Igneczi performs the charmingly bitter "Oh, Aint That 
Sweet, sung beautifully and complemented by adept 
dancing. From here, it's only a matter of time until both 
husband and wife wind up dead, driven mad by guilt.
Presenting a colorful, elaborate view of a city our country 
is still trying to rebuild, Thou Shalt Not succeeded on 
multiple fronts, with a talented cast, vibrant scenery and 
costumes, and an excellent work to draw from.

The Big Bang
Pittsburgh duo tells the story of the universeP^Paperhouse
BwmimtitfJQn sex in rock music3 radio station
The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust and the Pittsburgh Civic 
Light Opera Association (CLO) are running the two-man 
musical The Big Bang at the CLO Cabaret downtown. 
This over-the-top musical stars Marcus Stevens and Tim 
Hartman, who play Jed and Boyd, two men aspiring to 
put their Broadway musical into production. Complete 
with 1400 wigs, 6248 costumes, and 318 cast members, 
it only costs a measly $83 million dollars to produce. The 
problem is that Jed and Boyd are a little low on cash, so 
theyve brought in a load of investors (the audience) and 
have decided to cram their 13-hour, four-part musical 
into a mere 80 minutes, featuring 16 of their best songs 
and playing all the parts themselves as they pitch their 
dream show in the hopes of getting that $83 million.
The story of their musical? The entire history of the 
universe, from the big bang to King Henry VIII to 
Woodstock. It's not completely accurate, but it definitely 
beats attending Introduction to World History.
The night opens with an offering of various chocolates, 
cheeses, and bags of groceries from Whole Foods as Jed 
and Boyd venture around the audience, clearly sucking 
up to their prospective investors (which is why it's 
best to reserve a table near the front). With the use of 
an apartment belonging to a cute old Jewish couple on 
vacation, whose gigantic Andy Warhol style portrait 
is staring the audience in the face, they begin the 
shortened version of their musical with the number The 
Big Bang." From there, Jed and Boyd move through 
time via song to the Garden of Eden and later a surreal 
meeting of the Virgin Mary and Gandhi's mother. They 
construct the scenes using the limited resources they 
have: the borrowed apartment and the furniture inside 
of it. The two gradually destroy the apartment (which is 
being used without its owners permission), ripping the 
drapes down to use as togas; punching a hole in a clock 
for Napoleon's hat; and stealing bed sheets, blankets, 
and pillows to make all sorts of costumes.
The musical's version of history is rather skewed, 
making the show all the more hilarious. Its humor 
is based off of cultural stereotypes and various pop 
culture references. From Jewish slaves creating the 
pyramids to Pocahontas and Minnehaha criticizing the 
dating scene, this musical makes fun of every part of 
society. The songs themselves feature wit, cute puns, 
and parodies of history. Selections include "Free Food 
and Frontal Nudity, which is centered on Adam and 
Eve, while Cooking for Henry features Hartman and 
Stevens playing Henry VD3s chefs, complaining about 
how much he eats.
With Caesar done in the style of The Godfather, and 
Queen Nefertiti as a Diana Ross version of a queen,
impressions fly everywhere, and the two men change 
characters left and right as they try to impersonate 
almost every notable figure throughout the ages. The 
clothing changes keep the musical moving at a rapid 
pace, and Hartman and Stevens do an excellent job 
going from one character impression to another, one 
of the highlights of the show. They may be a little 
enthusiastic in their roles, exhibiting a bit of overacting 
(even for a musical), but they still provide a funny night 
overall. Some songs are not as funny as they could be, 
making them a little long, but both actors are excellent 
singers and the humorous bits certainly outnumber the 
dry ones.
The funniest moments, however, come not from the 
script itself, but instead from the pairs improvisations 
and interactions with the audience. Occasionally they 
are so funny they break character and make each 
other laugh. Pulling a member out of the audience last 
Saturday, Hartman and Stevens mocked both him and 
themselves as they asked the audience member to help 
Hartman get dressed.
In addition to the hilarious unscripted banter, the 
musical has plenty of other strong points, including a 
twist ending which throws Jed and Boyd into a panic; 
the two rush around trying to fix the apartment and get 
one last dime from their investors.
Though it's not as satirical as most CLO productions, 
The Big Bang succeeds as a jam-packed parody of 
history crammed into a fast-paced 90 minutes. Its 
certainly worth a trip downtown. The Cabaret also 
serves dinner and dessert before the show, making it 
a great place for that Valentines Day Date. Be wary, 
however, of those couples that get a bit too comfortable 
in public.
The Big Bang was originally performed by lyricist Boyd 
Graham, and composer Jed Feuer, playing themselves.
It first premiered in 1997 under the title Free Food 
and Frontal Nudity in Durham, N.C. The present title 
premiered in New York in 2000, and it has been in 
production around the U.S. ever since.

There are several good reasons to write about the song No Pussy Blues 
from punk band Grindermans self-titled debut, one of the foremost being 
to get the word pussy into a campus newspaper. This is one of last years 
best and bluntest songs; hopefully this essay will be seen by those who 
missed this gem of a song because of the FCC-unfriendly lyrics.
NPBs qualities exceed its naughtiness. Though the song appears on a 
debut album, the songwriter is not a crude young man; he is a crude old 
man, a veteran of 25 years in music, as Grinderman is a side project of Nick 
Cave and the Bad Seeds, around since the 80s. Heard through your stereo, 
Cave is a strong and bitter voice that speaks with archetypal authority. And 
what is he saying? That he cannot get any.
In the monologue that makes up most of the song, Cave describes how he 
approached a girl in the crowd at one of his shows, courted her in a variety 
of ways, and was constantly, repeatedly rejected because she just didnt 
want to. We dont know why, but the notable thing is that all tactics fail. 
Cave cannot clean himself up for her, cannot read poetry to her, cannot buy 
her presents, cannot talk sweetly to her, and cannot talk dirty to her: She 
just didnt want to becomes an endless, frustrated refrain that drives the 
music forward.
Most rock songs are about sex. This is a fact; the name of the genre is itself 
a euphemism for the act. Yet there is a long history of rock songs featuring 
depressed young men who are afraid to ask a girl out, are left by a girl and 
can do nothing, or just dont know how to love at all. Recently, emo has 
become famous for these fragile self-haters, but you can't ignore Belle & 
Sebastian, Death Cab for Cutie, or Weezer, or most break-up songs. Are 
these bands and songs any less about sex? Absolutely not  they just 
choose to dodge or sugar-coat the issue.
Nick Cave despises himself as much as any emo naf; at the opening of 
NPB he proclaims, "I must above all things love myself  I must above all 
things love myself! He then launches into a description of how he fails to 
do so  and of how it felt to be broken by this anonymous woman. But 
instead of pushing the sex out of the picture, Cave shoves it to the forefront. 
His overtures, sweet and harsh, all fail.
The song, mostly consisting of a fast drum/hi-hat rhythm and low, distorted 
bass, bursts into pulsing squeals on the two choruses, creating an oozy, 
thrashing scream that is hard to imagine coming from a guitar. Cave yells 
over this, Ive got the no pussy blues! along with Woo! and Damn! 
Its this amazing release, this sexual burst that is the ultimate response to 
anyone who thinks that being rejected means wrapping up in a blanket and 
listening to The Softies. Cave has returned to-the songs premise. He has 
learned he doesnt need her, that he must above all things love himself, 
and, looking down at his guitar, he has realized that he has all he'll ever 
need right in his hand.,

Romantic top 5s
Where to go and what to see
No Valentines Day entertainment section is complete without 
its Top Five lists. Here are our picks for the most romantic 
places to take your sweetheart, the tastiest meals, the best 
movies, and the ideal locations to find that special someone.
Top five spots near campus to watch the stars
If you're looking for an inexpensive way to treat your date 
(and don't have much time to spare between homework and 
more homework), take him or her to these romantic spots, all 
of which are within walking distance of campus.
Flagstaff Hill: Reconnect with nature (or, at least, with a 
small spot of well-manicured grass) while taking in the bright 
lights and bold colors of downtown Oakland.
Phipps Conservatory: Stroll lazily through the rooms of 
the conservatory, looking up through the skylights and into 
the bonsai area on the roof outside. The combination of the 
stillness of the flowers and the silence of the night is sure to 
bring you closer to that special guy or gal.
Panther Hollow Lake: Get away from the sounds of the city 
and the pressures of school by cozying up to your honey in 
this lush natural environment (that just happens to be in the 
middle of an urban park).
The top of the Cathedral of Learning: Seeing Oakland 
from this height puts it into perspective: Carnegie Mellon is 
just one part of a huge, bustling urban area. If your date feels 
overwhelmed, make sure you hold on tight.
The Posner Center roof: Sure, the backwards message 
on the bright blue wall isnt the most romantic of sights, but 
getting lost among the shrubbery and winding roads of the 
living roof is sure to make you closer.
Top five movies
Cozy up on the couch to any of these sappily-sweet flicks.
Love Actually. You knew it'd be on the list, and as much 
as we would love to be more creative, Hugh Grant is just too 
cute to pass up.
Pretty Woman: Every woman wants to be wined and dined
 albeit not necessarily after selling herself as a prostitute  
by a suave and successful business man a la Richard Gere in 
this classic chick flick.
Youve Got Mail: Meg Ryan, adorable. Tom Hanks, cute 
in the not-so-cute kind of way. Put them together, and you 
have the perfect combination of a drawn-out plot and some 
awesomely outdated technology.
The Notebook: Who doesnt love a movie about life-long 
love? In the film, Noah and Allie brave the obstacles before 
them and end up together forever. This is perfect for hopeless 
romantics.
The Wedding Singer. A musical romance so great its 
now a Broadway show. And if love isnt your thing, Billy Idol 
probably is .so you should enjoy it either way.
Top five romantic meals to cook together
Going out for dinner is always nice, but there is nothing quite 
like getting covered in flour and sticky with spaghetti sauce 
in the kitchen with your girl or guy.
Spaghetti and marinara sauce: You can get messy and 
let loose. If your date is the right one for you, he or she will 
think its cute (not gross) if you get splattered with Prego and 
covered in oregano.
Cookies: As long as theyre from scratch.
Cereal: Sharing a super-sized bowl of Kix is the perfect 
late-night (or early-morning) meal for two.
Hot chocolate: The ideal post-sledding treat. Try with 
peppermint and marshmallows.
Pizza: You can make pizza just the way you like it and maybe 
add in a cute message or picture made out of toppings.
Top five spots to meet someone new
Single and overwhelmed by images of red and white roses 
and too many boxes of chocolate to count? Head to these 
places to find your next mate.
The Carnegie Museum of Art: Get ready to meet your next
V-Day or D-Day?
Signs that your Valentines date wont succeed
It is true that Valentines Day cannot compete with more 
graceful holidays (Administrative Professionals Day? Arbor 
Day? How could it compete?), but for the rare person, V-Day 
is a standard excuse for dates, flowers, and candy. And 
inevitably, those choice few know that there is a fine line 
between V-Day and D-Day. Read on for some indicators on 
how to tell a dream date from a dud.
That bouquet of flowers is made of dandelions. And 
grass. Its winter here, so there wont be too many dandelions 
around  so you have to realize that they were special 
ordered. But even if they were special ordered from the coasts 
of Valencia, you also have to realize that the dinner that 
follows may be from Stouffers. Say no.
Your woman-date is rockin' a beehive. This hair means 
trouble. Yes, Amy Winehouse has recently collected the 
pieces of her life (she's in rehab; she got that gaping hole in 
.her mouth filled with an actual tooth), but that took her long 
enough. Just think about whether youd be embarrassed if 
the Internet erupted with a video of your girl smoking crack or 
photos of her wandering the streets in her only bra.
Your man-date is rockin' a beehive. Must I explain? You 
are only asking for trouble.
When your sweetheart calls to schedule your date, 
he or she starts with We need to talk. How could 
you not know what follows those infamous words? Everyone 
uses them  to reveal that she's pregnant, he's prematurely 
proposing or he or she is ready to split. On Valentine's Day. 
Romance at its finest, eh?
Your sweet love is a student at Carnegie Mellon.
Okay, so this is very general; but chances are, homework will 
consume your date and there will be no time, for Valentine 
dotings and'gift-giving. Unless you want him or her to flunk 
out, then the night will go on.
It's that night, and just you with a bottle of booze. 
(Youre 21 or over.) Drinking alone is hardly ever 
permissible. At least join some other single people and drink 
up; that way, you can still get some bonding in.
Your date would rather watch Lost than get with 
you. On second thought, this might be a good thing. To be
intellectual, creative date. The Carnegie Museum of Natural 
History works too, especially if your future sweetie is a nut for 
dinosaurs.
Crpes Parisiennes: This Craig Street caf is a great place 
to meet your fantastical mate  a French connoisseur of 
delicate breakfast foods (or, if you're lucky, at least someone 
wearing a beret).
Barnes & Noble: Stop by for an intellectually stimulating 
experience. Try the Squirrel Hill location; if things work out, 
you can catch a movie.
Walnut Street: If you can't make up your mind, look to this 
Shadyside avenue for a selection of restaurants, stores, coffee 
shops, and more.
Phipps Conservatory: The quintessential place to meet 
that introspective, pensive cutie.
Jessica Thurston | Forum Editor
distracted from good television is to disturb ones deepest 
moral values. Theres always time within the commercials.
You aren't your Valentines only date. True, this 
suggests that your date is a pimp or a sugar daddy, both of 
which are to be respected. But dont assume you are safe; 
with so many dates, that inevitably leads to a venereal 
disease. See below.
Your dates gift to you is a venereal disease. Seriously! 
Of course, you wont find this gift until after Valentines Day, 
but it will certainly be a surprise  a surprise party in your 
pants! Be warned of all of the infamous STDs and learn how to 
spell them. Hint: Chlamydia doesnt begin with a "K.
And if you dont have a date (or booze, or friends), remember 
that for many people Feb. 14 is just another day of the week. 
Treat yourself with delicious things and a season of one of 
your favorite TV shows, and maybe a side of major celebrity 
gossip. Lindsay Lohan is having a worse time than you, I bet.

Best valentine dates
From the ordinary to the extraordinary
Its that time again, the time where that special someone is 
expecting a great, romantic night, and, a few days before the 
big date, you're still not sure what youre doing for Valentine's 
Day. If youre lacking certain romantic instincts, then check 
out our list of the best Valentines Day dates from fact, fiction, 
and imagination. There are lots of great date ideas out there, 
from the typical to the insane, so get creative and make 
Valentine's Day special.
The Old Standby: Sometimes keeping it simple and playing 
it safe can be the best idea. Standby dates are pretty typical 
of the guy who gets a little nervous about being over-the-top 
romantic. He goes for the flowers and candy, maybe a private 
dinner. Maybe he makes her a mixed CD, or they just hang 
out together, go to lunch, or play a game. While it can be 
fun to go all-out on Valentines Day, there is no reason to feel 
obligated to do so. It can be way more fun for a couple to just 
sit around, talking and laughing, purely enjoying each others 
company.
The Hopeless Romantic: Expect to pull out all the stops 
on this date. This guy is perfectly comfortable with being 
romantic, and he doesnt really need any help with ideas. 
During the day, he surprises her by having roses delivered 
to her class: 12 red roses, 11 real and one fake, with a line 
attached to it like, "I will love you until the last rose dies. He 
wines and dines his girlfriend; a candlelit dinner in the back 
corner of an expensive restaurant. She is pleasantly surprised 
when he orders their meal in flawless French. Long moments 
are spent staring deeply into each others eyes, making quiet 
conversation. After a fantastic meal, they go on a long stroll 
through the city, hand in hand. They dance on the boardwalk 
under the stars to music only they can hear. He points out a
star to her, and passes her a paper from the International Star 
Registry saying that he has had the star named for her. All 
this might seem like its straight out of a movie, like A Walk 
To Remember or The Notebook, but it can be really fun to be 
romantic in real life.
The Unpredictable Date: On a date like this, you wont 
know what to expect. The guy will do anything out of the 
ordinary, which might mean not waiting for Valentines Day 
to do something special for his girl. Maybe hell take her to 
a drive-in movie that he set up in his backyard. Or maybe 
they'll take a hot-air balloon ride over the city at night, 
accompanied by champagne and soft music. Unpredictable 
dates are the best because they are more spontaneous and 
fun, perfect for the adventure-seeking type. Valentine's Day 
dates dont always have to be super-romantic. Here's a great 
example: He sends a messenger to her job and gives her a 
hand-written note with directions to a location. A scavenger 
hunt ensues, and at the end of it, he is waiting with a 
parachute and goggles; theyre going skydiving, which was 
something he knew shed always wanted to do.
The Dream Date: As vague as it is elusive, everyones idea 
of a dream date is different  it depends on who you are. 
Some people would go for the pretty typical mushy stuff. For 
some, the dream date is a unique experience in which their 
every wish comes true. Heres a scenario: She lives in a small, 
crowded triple with conservative roommates who are always 
there. So for some quiet time with her beau they usually go to 
his place. Unfortunately, that means dirty clothes on the floor, 
beer cans on the shelves, and a bathroom thats long overdue 
for a cleaning; she always complains about the mess. So for 
Valentines Day, he cleans his room, spreads a picnic blanket
on the floor, and has a cute dinner for two set up in his now 
. spotless room. And lets not forget what girls can do for their 
guys on Valentine's Day. Maybe she knows that he really 
wants to see an action movie, although he always agrees to 
see the chick flicks with her. So she volunteers to buy the 
tickets and surprises him by heading into the theater for the 
action movie. During the movie, she lets him enjoy it, never 
leaning over once to ask questions or complain about the 
violence.
The Singles Date: So what if youre single? Dont worry  
youre probably not the only one. On Valentines Day, find fun 
things to do with other single friends. Give each other candy, 
send one of them flowers from an anonymous Secret Admirer, 
or go out to dinner with a bunch of friends and make fun of 
the crazy things that people do on Valentines Day. For more 
fun, try sharing all of your best and worst Valentine's Day date 
stories. While Feb. 14 has been called Singles Awareness 
Day, that does not mean that its a day to be depressed if 
youre single. If youre single, enjoy it, but be nice to your 
friends who arent. If youre not single, try not to be too 
obnoxious about it in front of your single friends.
So whatever your plans are this Valentines Day, just make 
sure to have a little fun. You can treat yourself to a box of 
chocolates, but, more importantly, be sure to take some time 
to show your significant other, friend, or family member that 
you care.

NO MOVIE
Wednesday, Feb. 13
No film this Wednesday, so try 
to think of something useful to 
do during the time you normally 
watch these films. One idea 
would be to write a letter of 
complaint to AB Films, maybe 
suggesting they reinstate 
Wednesday movies so that a 
certain Tartan staffwriter can 
stop having to fill a certain space 
with witticisms that barely qualify 
as creative. Just a thought.
Secretary
Thursday, Feb. 14 
8 10 12
Secretary is a sexual black 
comedy that ventures into an 
area of film that is usually left to 
the porn industry. Stars Maggie 
Gyllenhaal (who won a Golden 
Globe for her role) and James 
Spader play flawed individuals 
who dive into the world of S&M 
to cope with exterior problems. 
Inserting humor at raw, dirty 
moments to ease up on some of 
the more intense scenes in the 
film, Secretary is a thoughtful 
and original film that should 
not be ignored. Gyllenhaal and 
Spader shine in roles countless 
other actors would wisely shy 
away from. Definitely not a 
date movie... unless, of course, 
youre into that kind of stuff.

Dan in Real Life
Friday, Feb. 15

Steve Carell is Dan, an advice 
columnist who could really 
use some of his own words of 
wisdom as he struggles to cope 
with the death of his wife while 
trying to stay close to his three 
daughters. Though Carell tones 
down his nuttiness this time, 
that doesnt mean this isnt just 
as funny as any comedy out 
there. Dan in Real Life delivers 
a heartfelt message about 
love lost and then found again 
amid a bevy of warm, fuzzy 
performances from people you 
didnt know could act.
Enchanted
Saturday, Feb. 16 
8 10 12
The best musical to come out 
in 2007 (sorry Hairspray fans), 
Enchanted blends animation 
with real life as Giselle, a classic 
Disney princess, played by Amy 
Adams, is forced from her fairytale land to New York City. Songs 
ensue as Giselle learns that not 
all stories end with happily ever 
after. Even though Disney clichs 
abound throughout the movie, 
the film remains pleasantly 
original  and watching fantasy 
darlings try to interact with 
grizzled New Yorkers is amusing 
to no end.
The Fly
Sunday, Feb. 17 
8 10 12
One of the more disgusting 
movies ever made, The Fly details 
eccentric scientist Seth Brundles 
tragic tlportation experiment 
that accidentally turns him into  
you guessed it  a fly. And if you 
thought human-sized flies would be 
cute, think again. The Brundlefly is 
horrific to a frightening degree, and 
Brundles mental transformation is 
just as scary. The Fly, also a remake, 
has become a lynchpin of the 
horror genre for its Oscar-winning 
makeup effects, which succeeded 
in the seemingly impossible task of 
giving Jeff Goldblum a spot in horror 
history forever.

Finally, if its Valentines Day, youre in a committed 
relationship, and youve had too many dates with this 
person to count, you can still make the most of it. In 
fact, knowing your mate means knowing what they 
think looks best on you (although your opinion on this 
should always come first). If you know he crumbles 
when you wear that chartreuse V-neck sweater (its 
unlikely, but hey, that's love), go for it. If she melts when 
you don the full suit  buttoned, cuffed, and all  
wear it. After all, in this situation, youll best impress 
your date by just being you.
Overall, just remember that, if youre uncomfortable 
in the clothes youve chosen before even leaving your 
dorm room, you should put on something thats more 
you. Avoid neon colors (unless youre going to a roller 
rink, which could be pretty sweet), too much polyester, 
and save the beat-up Tartans sweatshirt for the next 
morning.

That said, its best to break it down by

If it's a first date and you're in it for love, be yourself. 
Theyll find out the truth eventually anyway, so if pink 
isnt your thing and you cringe at the thought of a 
high-waisted skirt, go with what suits you best. Opt 
for form-fitting, well-cut pants paired with a more 
forgiving top, or vice versa. Choose calm, yet flattering, 
colors, like chocolate brown with blue, or black with

someone, don't send mixed messages by wearing an 
overly-sequined, club-hopping top if you never plan on 
doing so in the future. Go for something form-flattering, 
yes, but not cheesy: Think a high-necked, delicately 
laced top with some strategic darting and stitching. 
And guys, wear a nice button-down, not a sparkly, 
short-sleeved Hawaiian-style shirt or one-half of a disco 
outfit gone wrong.

If Valentine's Day is all about the physical to you (it is 
a somewhat superficial holiday, so this isnt too far
fetched of a concept), look the part. Girls, don a sirenred or bubble-gum-pink strappy dress (this is probably 
the only time its acceptable to wear such a hackneyed 
color), and add the stilletto  as long as you can walk 
in it (we do advise wearing closed-toe pumps over 
strappy heels, though, as it is wintertime in, Pittsburgh). 
And, just because you want to get down and dirty 
doesn't mean you have to sacrifice your entire sense 
of style. Ciosed-toe shoes are generally more classy, 
especially when in a matte neutral color (think brown or 
black) instead of a dazzlingly tacky silver.

A single valentine
What to do when youre single on V-Day
Valentines Day: the day for red roses, pink hearts, and 
romantic, candle-lit dinners. But, for those who woke up 
this morning and put on sunglasses to shield their eyes 
from the bright pink and red, this article is for them: those 
poor single people whose plight, on a day like this, is only 
confusion and more loneliness.
On the dreaded 14th, mushy, lovey-dovey couples and 
decorations are almost everywhere, and its enough to 
make most singles want to hurl. Theres a couple holding 
hands around every corner, each a stark reminder of the 
fact that the only thing most Valentine's singles have 
to hold are their textbooks. And speaking of textbooks, 
whats a single to do at night on Valentines Day besides 
cuddle up with 100 or so pages of reading?
Syeda Sara Abbas | Art Staff
The group can get dressed up, reserve a table at a great 
restaurant, and have a dinner that's romantic in its own 
right. For a night in, friends might try to meet up at 
someones apartment and cook a meal. If things begin to 
burn, remember, theres always Vocelli.
Of course not. In fact, some would argue that being 
single is actually better. For singles, theres no need to 
put up with anyone elses mood swings or carry their 
emotional baggage. Theres no chance of having to sit 
through anyones boring football games, pretending to 
look interested. Nor is there need to lie awake wondering 
how to get the perfect gift for an anniversary. If a person is 
single, they dont have to care about that jealous boyfriend 
watching their every move  or put up with that clingy 
girlfriend who is already pulling out wedding catalogs, 
preparing for when they pop the question.
Being single is so much simpler.
In fact, being single is even better on Valentines Day, 
because there are no worries about dinner reservations 
or gifts or romantic gestures. No need to think a month in 
advance about what to do or to shell out huge amounts 
of cash to make a reservation at a swanky restaurant. 
Valentines Day is much less stressful without the need to 
impress anybody.
And if Valentines Day is all about love, why is it necessary 
to express that love to only a significant other? The best 
way for a single person to keep up with all the pink is to 
just give up and join in. No, that doesnt mean they should 
run towards the next person they see; rather, it means they 
should pick up their cell phone and call a whole bunch of 
their single friends for a crazy night out. Theres no need 
to be single and lonely. Friends are the perfect people 
to express love to, and they're willing to give as well as 
receive. And they're less likely to leave you for that hot 
blonde cheerleader (or football player).
For someone whos single, a fun dinner with friends is 
the perfect antidote to tacky Valentines Day traditions. 
If it seems like everyone else is receiving a gift, single 
Valentines should keep in mind that they can always get 
something for themselves. Theres no better excuse to 
splurge than Valentines Day: giant bouquets, cute earrings, 
and little black dresses are all acceptable gifts for the self.
For those who still like receiving surprise gifts, arrange a 
gift exchange with some close friends  each can buy 
some sexy lingerie to liven up the day. This way, no one in 
the group will end up like the poor girlfriend who got an 
electric toothbrush from her beau, or the boyfriend who got 
another CD holder for his car. Friends always know what to 
get for a gift, and the chance of ending up with something 
unwanted is slim.
For any singles still thinking about spending Valentine's 
Day with a textbook, remember that the holiday isn't even a 
real celebration of love  its just a bogus holiday invented 
by Hallmark to sell greeting cards. Being alone on this one 
day does not mean loneliness till the end of time.
So, once the realization hits that Valentines Day isnt 
actually real, spend the day mocking it. Grab that same 
bunch of single friends and rent a stack of cheesy romance 
movies (for a list, see page 6). Bring out the buttered 
popcorn and settle into the couch for one hilarious night 
(throwing popcorn at the screen is recommended).
Happy being anti-Valentines? Go for a walk and make fun 
of all the couples you see; its amazing how many truly 
goofy ones youll find. Learn to laugh at the ridiculousness 
of it all. It might be mean, but it will definitely be satisfying.
But if at the end all else fails and youre still stuck in your 
room alone at night, just sleep through it. Rest assured.that 
tomorrow when the sun rises, the day wont be so pink.
Shweta Suresh | Assistant Pillbox Editor
But hold on just a second. Why should singles be forced 
to spend the night alone and studying, while those in 
relationships are out having a good time? Must they be 
reduced to doing homework just to escape the everhovering feeling of loneliness?

College of Fine Arts produces podcasts
Students and faculty work together to study the effects of art on life
Appealing to hordes of iPod-toting students, the College of 
Fine Arts has created a podcast program. Called Lab A6, 
the program produces podcasts showing the ways .that art 
impacts life. Eric Sloss, director of media relations for the 
College of Fine Arts, has served as producer of the podcasts 
since they first began airing in March 2007.
"I came up with the idea because I like the way the 
radio medium has the ability to capture good, thoughtful 
conversation, Sloss said.
The process began with an idea to use the format of the 
radio medium to discuss art and how it impacts life. After 
Sloss ananged the program with the recording engineering 
department in the School of Music, he began creating 
podcasts of interviews with faculty members. The podcasts 
are supported by Margaret Myers, associate director for the 
Studio of Creative Inquiry:
[The podcasts have] progressed to having larger 
conversations about how art impacts life in a broader sense," 
Sloss said. They explore a realm larger than Carnegie Mellon, 
and topics introduced in the podcasts are relevant to the 
entire arts community.
Recording engineer and music professor Riccardo Schulz 
records the podcasts, which usually occur on Friday 
afternoons. In addition to recording the podcasts, Schulz was 
responsible for teaching associate producer and BHA junior 
Matthew Campbell to edit the recordings.
"Once the recordings are made, we transfer them to the 
School of Music server, and Matt Campbell does some minor 
editing and uploads them to a website so they are available to. 
the general public, Schulz said.
While many of the topics may seem to relate only to the 
Carnegie Mellon community, such as the interview with 
Consul director Gregory Lehane, the subjects addressed 
within the interview extend beyond the university.
Campbell described the podcasts as timeless," things that 
would be relevant even after the events inspiring them had 
ended. The podcasts provide a unique perspective on art, 
often originating from the artists themselves.
"Normally, when you go to a gallery, you don't get to talk to 
the artist, Campbell said. Lab A6 gives you the opportunity 
to discuss the works with the artist. When we write the 
questions, we take on the role of the audience.
Although the podcasts contain information from art experts, 
including Carnegie Mellon professors, they are not meant 
for a specialized audience. The podcasts are designed to be 
available and understandable to everyone, instead of just 
artists and musicians. They give a behind-the-scenes look at 
some of the things happening within the arts, both on campus 
and off, including stage performances and art exhibits.
Its more about the ideas behind the exhibits than the works 
in the exhibit," Campbell said.
Not only are the interviews Carnegie Mellon related, but the 
music also has ties to the university. The Starling Quartet, a 
Carnegie Mellon performance group, performed the music 
used for the opening and closing theme of the podcasts, and 
most other music included in the podcasts as well.
The podcasts often discuss the significant effect of the arts on 
the community. According to Campbell, arts companies are 
huge employers, affecting the economy of the cities in which 
they are based. In addition, the quality of life improves for the 
people in the cities with arts programs available. Residents of 
the cities are able to attend operas and other performances, 
bringing more culture to the cities.
The podcasts produced by Lab A6 are made available to the 
public both on the Lab A6 website (www.cmu.edu/cfa/labA6. 
html) and on iTunes U.
The next planned podcast will feature David Wettergreen of 
the Robotics Institute with discussion on the impact of the 
arts on science. The podcast is scheduled to be recorded this 
Friday.
