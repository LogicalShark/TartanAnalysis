Services 
offers new 
networking 
solutions
by Erin Szeto
[ Junior Staffwriter
Students at Carnegie Mellon 
apparently arent the only people 
ith a lot on their hands. With the 
spansion of Wireless Andrew to off:ampus locations and the introduc
tion of virtual clusters around the 
;MU campus, Computing Services 
as been quite busy planning and 
leveloping these two projects.
In the past, students, faculty and 
itaff members could only operate 
the Andrew system if their comput
es were connected to the network 
through a data outlet, such as the 
jones found in clusters and on-camHi6 dorm rooms. However, Wireless 
Andrew reduces the need for wires 
nd cables by introducing the ability 
to connect laptop computers to the 
network from anywhere on campus.
Building on the current wired net
work infrastructure with Lucent 
Technologys recently upgraded 
WaveLAN equipment, the highipeed wireless service works 
through access points, which are 
called WavePOINT units, and net
work adapters, which are called 
WaveLAN cards. The WavePOINT, a 
jase station connected to the wired 
ocal network, uses radio frequen
cies to communicate with wireless 
devices within its communication 
ange. The WaveLAN card consists 
of a transmitter, receiver, antenna 
and hardware that provides the data 
letwork interface it receives from 
the mobile computer to the base sta
tion. The wireless network runs at 11 
mega bytes per second  a typical 
dial-up modem runs at 5 6K bytes per 
second  but the speed depends 
more on how near the person is to 
the base station, how many people 
are using it in a given area, and what 
kind of data the various users are 
passing over the network.

Companies work to recruit CMU students at TOC, BOC
aktmrt Ovutekcl[[m[etre ,kiei fgmeiu
Many students visited booths like the one shown above in order 
to obtain company information and talk to representatives.
by Eve Chen
Junior Staffwriter
Last Thursday and Friday, students had the chance to not 
only pick up free t-shirts and light up bouncy balls, but also to 
talk to different company representatives about full-time and 
internship positions during the Technical Opportunities 
Conference (TOC) and Business Opportunities Conference 
(BOC).
Students began planning for the two conferences much in 
advance, however. [The BOC committee] started meeting in 
spring, doing groundwork like contacting departments, writ
ing brochures, and coming up with an identity for the confer
ence, said Jenny Stapleton, co-chair of the BOC. The slogan 
for BOC was Defining Tomorrow.
Similarly, preparations for the TOC started long before the
actual conference. According to Amy Lin, a senior in chemical 
engineering and also the chair of the TOC committee, the 
committee started meeting last fall and had to make many ini
tial contacts in the spring to make reservations for hotels and 
shuttles.
Both committees have to notify the companies of the con
ference dates as well. In order to search for possible compa
nies-for the conferences, both the TOC and BOC committees 
sent out information to companies on the Society of Women 
Engineers (SWE) and the Association of Industrial 
Management and Economics (AIME) databases. Both confer
ences allow the companies to register for the conference 
online and by mail. Some companies outside of the databases 
register out of their own interest or through recommenda
tions of CMU alumni who now work for them, said Stapleton, 
The committees also seek out companies actively.
Sometimes we just look through the database for compa
nies we think would be a good match for the conference, 
Stapleton said. We also went to other job fairs and talked to 
companies there. When certain departments within the 
school want more companies in their field of expertise, the 
TOC committee would also search out companies for these 
departments. Roughly 180 companies were present at the 
TOC, with over 100 companies on the waitlist, said Lin. The 
BOC had 56 companies at the conference.
As the day of conference drew near, TOC and BOC commit
tees still had much work to do. TOC volunteers worked both 
in the afternoon and in the night on Wednesday to set up tlje 
University. On the actual day of TOC, volunteers worked from 
7 am to 7 pm in order to set up booths and organize matters 
afterwards. Most of the volunteers for the TOC came from 
SWE members. In addition, it also hired help from IEEE and 
AichE.
Student volunteers for the BOC went to the University 
Center at about 6:30 am on Friday to make sure everything 
would be ready when the company recruiters arrived. They 
stayed through 7 pm for various tasks such as setting up 
chairs and tearing down booths after the conference.
As for the actual helpfulness of the TOC and the BOC, stu
dents had differing opinions. I think its a giant resume drop 
box, said Parag Patel, a senior in mechanical engineering.
The real good jobs out there are not advertised because they 
know they can get students to do low entry level jobs, but its' 
a good thing because it advertises companies.
Although most companies at the TOC and BOC do ask for. 
resumes, they also say that they want more from the students : 
as well.

will appear at a fund-raiser at a 
Unitarian Church in Shadyside.
All four presidential candidates 
have visited in the region in the 
last few weeks. Democrat A1 Gore 
appeared on Labor Day at Point 
State Park, and spoke about working families. Republican George 
W. Bush met with supporters at an 
invitation-only event in the 
Perryville Business District last 
Wednesday. ReformParty candi

Last semester, six granite stones 
fell from the roof of the College of 
Fine Arts through a skylight and into 
the Hewlett gallery. While no one 
was injured during the accident, it 
sent a message to Facilities 
Management that this problem was 
one that required immediate atten
tion. Scaffolding, which served to 
provide support and protection in 
addition to access to the roof area, 
was quickly set up around the build
ings perimeter and a study of the
roof area of the building was con
ducted.
As the granite stones along the 
decorative edge of the building were 
removed, the steel beams that 
anchored the stones in place were 
examined and determined to be in 
need of replacement, according to 
Marty Altschul, University Engineer.
We had that steel analyzed, and 
although there is plenty of steel 
there, there was enough oxidation 
and corrosion over time that it was 
recommended that we replace all of 
that steel beam, said Altschul.

Excitement for the upcoming 
presidential election swept campus 
last week as students and faculty 
took advantage of the voter regis
tration effort being held in the 
University Center. Sponsored by 
Student Activities, Student Affairs, 
Activities Board Political Speakers, 
and a myriad of volunteers, the 
voter registration table served as a 
prime location for the campus com
munity to both register as voters 
and apply for absentee ballots. 
Students Erin Andrew, Faith Cole, 
and Bea Diaz initiated the registra
tion project after their summer 
political fellowship asked that they 
contribute something back to their 
community in the way of political 
advocacy. The three organizers 
chose registering CMU students to 
vote as a highly worthwhile project.
The trio decided upon a voter 
registration program in part 
because of the proportionately low 
number of young adults that regis
ter and/or vote. Forty-three percent 
of 18-19 year olds are registered 
and 30 percent actually vote, while

Over the summer Carnegie 
Mellon received $800,000 from 
the Andrew W. Mellon 
Foundation to create the Center 
for the Arts in Society. From the 
same lineage as the Bachelors of 
Humanities and Arts program, 
the new center aims to bring 
together artists, historians, and 
social scientists to study and 
research the interaction of cul
ture, art, and society. The grant 
will allow the College of 
Humanities and Social Sciences 
and the College of Fine Arts to 
fund the new center and to hire 
new faculty and post-graduate 
students for research and teach
ing positions.
The central thesis is that [the 
center] should combine aspects 
of the arts with the humanistic 
side, said Judith S. Modell, pro

Clinton defends oil reserve tap
 WASHINGTON (AP) - Amid 
growing global worries about the 
conomie impact of high oil prices, 
President Clinton said Saturday 
iflt tapping the U.S. emergency oil 
rserve was plainly the prudent 
'tiling to do. He denied he was 
motivated by politics.
Families shouldnt have to drain 
their wallets to drive their cars or 
heat their homes, he said at the 
.White House before leaving on a 
. trip to California.
-Clinton said he acted to cushion 
Americans against a likely sharp 
jump in heating costs this winter 
/because of tight supplies.
,The government will start taking 
.bjds Monday for 30 million barrels 
of oil  about 5 percent of the 571 
million barrel reserve  for deliv
ery-in November.
Although the price has moderat
ed in recent days, crude oil remains 
above $34 a barrel. High prices 
have led to demonstrations in 
'France and England and unease in 
the United States,- where gas sta
tions charged more than $2 a gal
lon in some areas this summer.
 -Rising energy costs are becoming 
aft issue in the presidential cam
paign as winter bills are expected to 
be as much as 50 percent higher 
than 1999s.
Despite incremental production 
increases by the Organization of 
fille 'Petroleum Exporting Counties, 
worldwide supplies remain 
extremely tight, largely because of
strong U.S. economy and a quick'er' than expected economic 
boUnd in Asia, analysts say.
' - Economists cited energy costs as 
one reason for Europes currency 
-problem that on Friday prompted a 
 dramatic attempt to prop up the 
euro. A meeting of the worlds top 
finance ministers, which began 
Saturday in the. Czech Republic, 
has taken on additional urgency 
,;beause of concern that oil prices 
rCoUld hamstring the world econo
my if not contained.
Treasury Secretary Lawrence 
Summers, in private discussions 
with other ministers Saturday, 
explained Clintons use of the emer
gency oil reserve. More broadly, he 
characterized the high cost of oil 
the biggest cloud in the relatively 
blue sky of a fundamentally sound 
global economy.
The ministers, in a communiqu, 
welcomed the U.S. decision to use 
the oil to deal with what Japans 
minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, said was 
the most serious problem facing 
the ministers conference. '
Senior U.S. officials quickly cited 
the endorsement as evidence that 
the release was not viewed around 
the world as a political decision.
At the White House, the presi
dent dismissed suggestions by 
Republicans  including George 
W. Bush, Vice President A1 Gores 
GOP rival for the White House  
that tapping the reserve would not 
be in the national interest or that he 
was acting to aid Gores candidacy.
Its plainly the prudent thing to 
do ... This is the right thing to do. 
Its good energy policy, Clinton 
said.
He also said the Republican-con
trolled Congress had chopped, 
blocked and ignored administra
tion proposals aimed at promoting 
energy efficiency and renewable 
energy sources.
In response, a House GOP leader, 
Oklahoma Rep. J.C. Watts, said the 
administration has done nothing 
over the past seven and a half years 
to put in place a comprehensive 
energy policy.
Campaigning in Florida, Bush 
said Saturday that Gore is using the 
Strategic Petroleum Reserve as if 
its the strategic political reserve. 
Gore on Thursday proposed tap
ping the reserve; Clintons 
announcement came Friday.
The government oil is to be 
released as part of a swap that
will require recipients of the crude 
to return a like amount of oil - plus 
a negotiated premium amount - 
next year when prices are expected 
to be lower. First deliveries are 
expected in November.
Clinton also announced that 
states will share $400 million to 
help families that can least bear the 
burden of high energy prices. He 
said it was the largest such release 
ever of low-income energy assis
tance funds.
Gene Sperling, Clintons top eco
nomic adviser, said that despite 
reservations in the spring about 
using the reserve, all of the presi
dents economic advisers supported 
his decision.
Analysts were uncertain about 
the impact of the drawdown.
Down the line it could help 
some. It wont help instantly, said 
Wilfrid L. Kohl of Johns Hopkins 
School of Advanced International 
Studies.
Prices will fall, but the effect will 
be temporary, said Venezuela oil 
minister Ali Rodriquez, the current 
OPEC president.
Some energy experts and others 
said the action shows the adminis
tration may intervene again if oil 
prices do not decline. Others raised 
the possibility that OPEC might 
retaliate by holding back produc
tion.
Saudi Arabia, the closest U.S. ally 
among OPEC members, criticized 
Clintons decision, but U.S. officials 
said the Saudis had assured them 
they were not too upset. Saudi 
Arabia has said oil prices are too 
high and should be in the $25 to 
$28 a barrel range.
It is only the second time since 
the emergency reserve was created 
after the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo 
that oil has been ordered taken to 
deal with supply problems. The 
other was in 1991 when 21 million 
barrels were drawn just before and 
during the Persian Gulf War.
Child critically injured at Disney
ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP)  A 4- 
year-old boy was in critical condi
tion Saturday after he became 
pinned beneath a car on 
^Disneylands Roger Rabbit Car 
Toon Spin ride, police said, 
v 'Paramedics arrived at the theme 
.park late Friday to find the 
Southern California boy under
neath a vehicle, said Cynthia 
iMarriss, president of Disneyland 
Resort.
-There appeared to be no malfunction of the ride or the safety 
mechanism, said police Lieutenant 
Joe Vargas. How he got from the 
car to the ground is something 
theyll have to determine.
California Occupational Safety 
and Health Administration also 
was investigating, Harriss said 
Saturday.
Details of the boys injuries and 
his name were withheld by his par
ents, said nursing supervisor Jean 
Necas at University of California,
Irvine Medical Center.
The Car Toon Spin is a slow-mov
ing, 5-minute ride in which passen
gers take a cab through a cartoon 
world.
In April, a 13-year-old girl was 
seriously injured on the same ride 
when she got off to retrieve a 
stuffed toy and her foot became 
caught in the rails that the rides 
cars travel on. The ride had to be 
shut down while paramedics freed 
her.

Indiana U. prof 
writes book about 
sports effects
(U-WIRE) BLOOMINGTON, Ind. 
 Indiana University professor 
Murray Sperbers office in 
Ballantine Hall is a disorganized 
mess. His computer sits on a wooden 
chair, boxes clutter the small room 
and stacks of papers fill almost 
every square inch of free space. 
Theres barely enough room for his 
dog to find a spot to lay down.
Sperber hasnt been in his office 
since May, when he decided to take 
an unpaid leave of absence in fear 
for his safety. The English professor 
had made critical comments about 
former coach Bob Knight during a 
University investigation into the 
claims made by former player Neil 
Reed, and in turn received threaten
ing phone calls and emails from 
angry Knight supporters.
Now the coach is gone. And 
Sperber said he hopes its safe to 
return. But before he begins teach
ing two undergraduate courses next 
spring, Sperber will take a national 
book tour, that began Thursday in 
New York. Sperbers fourth book, 
Beer and Circus: How Big-time 
College Sports is Crippling
Undergraduate Education, was 
released Thursday. There are about 
three pages in the book regarding 
Knight, and Sperber insists the tim
ing of the book release was coinci
dental with Knights firing. He 
signed the contract in 1994 and fin
ished the book in January.
Sperber returned to campus 
Monday after spending the majority 
of the summer in Montreal. He did
nt expect to resume teaching until 
next year because he didnt think 
Knight would be fired so soon.
The book is a harsh critique of 
high-profile college sports and the 
universities that sponsor them.
Sperber said his main contribu
tors to the book were students of 
various universities because they 
were the most open. His students in 
particular helped with much of the 
research by filling out question
naires and developing their own 
questions about college life and the 
sports experience. He also said he 
lived the book, referring to his 
involvement in the Knight investiga
tions.
Vedder, Nader 
in Seattle
SEATTLE (AP)  It was grunge 
and green together.
Eddie Vedder, front man for
rally :
Seattle grunge rock supergroup 
Pearl Jam, rallied Saturday nightjn 
support of Green Party Presidential 
candidate Ralph Nader, who repeat
ed his call to be included in upconv 
ing Bush and Gore presidential 
debates.
Ive never been to one of thes.;l 
think the reason why is Ive never 
had anyone I could believe 
before, Vedder told the crowd-pf 
several thousand.
Vedder, accompanying himsgjf 
with the acoustic guitar, vteimed^p 
the crowd with two songs whose 
lyrics took jabs at the land of corpo
rate leaders Nader has mad^qa 
career of skewering.
Nader slammed what he called 
the unacceptable inequality ,^f 
wealth in the United States. This, is 
not a so-called banana republic. TJrjs 
is the United States, Nader said, 
asserting that many people are mak
ing less in real wages than they We 
decades ago.
Workers should not be making 
less than what they made in 19&8. 
They should be making double wjjat 
they made in 1968, he said.
Touting his Green Party candida
cy, Nader said Americans should not 
have to choose between the lesser 
of two evils and the evil of t^o 
lessers. Sometimes the safest thyig 
to do is take a chance.

Government stops 
many in Kosovo 
from voting
KOSOVSKA MITROVICA,
Yugoslavia (AP)  With U.S. and 
other peacekeepers discreetly 
watching, Kosovo Serbs voted 
Sunday in Yugoslav elections 
marred by confusion and irregulari
ties that the opposition said were 
aimed at bolstering President 
Slobodan Milosevic.
In several areas visited by 
reporters, Kosovo Serbs went to 
polling stations that never opened. 
Others were given no privacy to 
mark their ballots or were turned 
away because their names did not 
appear on registration lists.
If they create so much confusion, 
it is better for them so they can 
manipulate the vote, said Dragisan 
Djokovic, head of the local branch of 
the main Serb opposition party.
Officials of Milosevics Socialist 
Party denied any systematic attempt 
to deprive people of their right to 
vote. A Socialist Party official here, 
Zdravko Trajkovic, said confusion 
was a result of problems bringing 
election materials into the province.
He said many Kosovo Serbs had 
lost their documents in the turmoil 
of the Kosovo conflict and had failed 
to register. He also said there may 
have been a few cases where
deceased people remained on the 
voting rolls because their deaths had 
not been recorded yet.
Nevertheless, irregularities were 
not limited to this Serb stronghold 
30 miles northwest of the Kosovo 
capital Pristina.
In Caglavica, one of Kosovos most 
prominent Serbs, Momcilo 
Trajkovic, was refused permission to 
vote because his name was not on 
the registration rolls. Trajkovic, a 
lifelong resident of the area, sup
ports Milosevics main challenger, 
Vojislav Kostunica.
Of course I wanted to vote, said 
Jelica Markovic, age 25, another 
lifelong Caglavica resident who was 
turned away. Its not right that they 
should say I dont have the right to 
vote.
Kosovo is considered critical to 
any attempt by Milosevics govern
ment to rig the election, because the 
lack of a proper census there in 
years makes it difficult to determine 
the actual number of potential vot
ers.
The U.N.-led administration 
allowed balloting in the province 
since it remains part of Yugoslavia 
despite international administra
tion.
Ethnic Albanians, who make up 
90 percent of Kosovos population, 
stayed away and Kouchner said any 
claim of participation by Kosovo 
Albanians is a fiction or manipula
tion.
Lewinsky reports

NEW YORK (AP)  Monfea

licist said Sunday.
The former White House intefcn 
has agreed to host six 4-minute seg
ments dubbed Postcards fram 
Monica for Britains ChannelJ5, 
according to Juli Nadler, jLewinsky?s 
spokeswoman. L
Nadler said the segments would 
be a lighthearted look at American 
pop culture for British viewers. She 
declined to say how much Lewinsky 
would be paid.
Though the segments will air in 
.November, Lewinsky wont ube 
reporting on the United States 
major event of that month: the pres
idential election. i >1
Monicas agreement with ITN, 
Channel 5, stipulates what has 
always been her position - that she 
refuses to make any public comment 
on any political issues, including the 
U.S. elections, Nadler said. .<
Clintons affair with Lewinsky led 
to his impeachment trial last yean4n 
the Senate. He was acquitted.
Since the scandal, Lewinsky has 
written a book and has started her 
own line of handbags.

do interviews, said Patel.
There are those who seriously 
wanted to find jobs from the con
ferences as well. I met the career 
consultant to prepare myself [and 
learn] how to talk to people, how to 
do my resume, said Shail Pandya, 
a graduate student in civil and envi
ronmental engineering. I worked 
on my resume for four or five 
weeks, improve, improve, 
improve.
Even for those that do not need 
jobs, the conferences provide useful 
experiences.
I like the fact its in beginning of 
the year, said Nanda Chassot, a 
sophomore majoring in industrial 
design and HCI. Its like a warm
up because then later in the year I 
can really go look for a job now that 
Ive seen all these companies and 
people. Although Chassot already 
has a summer job, she says the con
ference makes her hopeful.
Its nice to know that our 
University attracts really huge com
panies, said Chassot. Its positive 
to think that someday I might actu
ally get a job.
Representatives from around 180 companies were at the University on 
Thursday and Friday working to recruit students at the TOC and BOC.
Duke president: Napster staying put
(U-WIRE) DURHAM, N.C.  And 
the bands will play on.
Citing academic freedom and a 
lack of legal responsibility, Duke 
. University Thursday refused to ban 
-Napster  a computer program 
that allows millions of users to 
-exchange music over the Internet 
  from its network after lawyers 
representing two popular artists 
last week sent a letter asking 
President Nan Keohane to do so.
byS Duke University has long been 
committed to fundamental princi
ples of academic freedom and the 
uncensored dissemination of 
knowledge and information, 
Assistant University Counsel Kate 
' Hendricks wrote in Dukes official 
response. Banning access to 
Napster, therefore, would be an 
overbroad response to a specific 
problem and it would have the 
effect of foreclosing legitimate and 
lawful uses of Napster.
But Howard King, the lawyer for 
<= Dr. Dre and Metallica who sent the 
initial letter, disagrees with Dukes 
argument about academic freedom. 
- I think thats a little disingenu
ous, and Im a little disappointed, 
j King said. In the name of preventing censorship, I think universities 
are allowing something else far 
worse: rampant thievery of copy
righted material.
But Keohane responded that 
Napster has some legal uses and 
that simply banning the site is not a 
good solution to the concerns it 
raises.
We did not want to ban Napster 
because there are a number of quite 
legitimate uses of the software in 
moving bodies of data around, and 
this is an area where such programs 
will become increasingly familiar, 
said Keohane. We need to deal 
with the root of the problem in 
copyright protection and find good 
payments systems rather than ban 
something that facilitates legiti
mate communication.
King said he has received similar 
responses from officials at Stanford 
University and the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology, and that he 
will concentrate on finding a com
promise with these schools.
One such compromise has been 
reached at several schools where 
Napster is banned from private 
computers but may exist on com
puters that can be monitored.
University officials said they have 
no plans to change their policy. 
Executive Vice President Tallman 
Trask was scheduled to send an 
email Thursday night informing 
students of the Universitys deci
sion.
We will also redouble our efforts 
to make sure Duke students under
stand their liability for misuse of 
such systems, Keohane said.
This is not, however, the end of 
the Napster controversy. University 
officials said they will closely watch 
a number of cases around the coun
try and will re-evaluate their deci
sion if necessary.
Undoubtedly, they will watch the 
proceedings of charges filed against 
the University of Southern 
California, Yale University and 
Indiana University by Dre and 
Metallica earlier this year.
The company that created 
Napster is facing its share of litiga
tion as well. In late July, a San 
Francisco appeals court judge 
granted a preliminary injunction 
against the Web site that distributes 
the software. A higher court later 
delayed that injunction, and a final 
ruling is expected in early October.

University promotes voter 
registraton on campus
VOTE, from page A1 
51 percent of 20-24 year olds are 
registered and 33 percent actually 
vote. Compared to older age 
groups, like 65-74 year olds who 
have a 78 percent registration rate 
and a 70 percent voter turn out, 
young people are not equally repre
sented in elections. Voting is the 
one power that people have over 
elected officials, said Andrew, a 
junior business administration 
major. People tend to forget how 
important it is to those who were 
once denied the right to vote  
especially at a school like this that 
often seems politically apathetic.
With the use of two laptop com
puters and printers, along with 
financial backing for postage 
donated by Student Activities, 
table volunteers helped campus 
members fill out registration forms 
and find absentee ballots for their 
individual states on the Internet. 
Students who stopped at the table 
were carefully taken through the 
steps that would allow them to vot 
in the upcoming November sev
enth election. An almost constant 
stream of interested students kept 
the volunteers busy answering 
questions and gathering applica
tions for mailing.
Nearly 500 new registered voters
and/or requests for absentee bal
lots over the past week have shown 
that students at CMU are truly 
interested in the electoral process - 
especially with the upcoming pres
idential election. I think that peo
ple do care. Im really impressed 
with how people have responded, 
said Cole, a junior anthropology 
major.
When asked why they decided to 
register to vote, student replies var
ied. If I ever want to speak with an 
elected official, I dont think theyll 
take me seriously unless Im actual
ly registered to vote, said Kevin 
Inderhees, a sophomore physics 
major. Im from Tennessee and I 
definitely want Gore to win. It 
seems like it will be a close race, so 
Id better vote, said Tara Gilbreath, 
a first-year ethics, history, and pub
lic policy major.
Although the program was con
ceived by only a few students, the ( 
entire project was executed by a 
wide variety of campus groups and 
individuals who strove to become 
involved as supporters and volun
teers. A diverse coalition spear
headed the effort, and in return, a 
broad cross-section of students and 
faculty responded in registering to 
vote and picking up absentee bal
lots.
Nader visits campus 
to speak to students
NADER, from page A1 
ning for president on a third party 
ticket with his running-mate 
Winona La Duke, a Native 
American activist and author. 
Naders platform is aligned with 
the Green Partykey principles of 
the party include social justice and 
environmental responsibility.
Some of Naders major stances 
have afforded him national atten
tion. Most recently, he made head
lines after being declared the victor 
in a lawsuit with MasterCard  the 
company attempted to enforce a 
stoppage of one of Naders televi
sion ads which closely resembled 
MasterCards priceless spots. He 
has taken action on issues pertain
ing to third-party representation, 
by proposing widespread cam
paign finance reform and himself 
refusing donations from large cor
porations.
In addition, he has filed lawsuits 
to allow third-party candidates eas
ier access to state ballots. Most 
recently, a judge ruled to put him 
on the ballot in West Virginia, stat
ing that the petition signature 
requirements for that state were 
over-burdensome. His name will 
appear on the presidential ballot in 
44 states, including Pennsylvania.
Nader also takes issue with the 
system of presidential debates. 
Currently, he is lobbying the 
Commission on Presidential 
Debates to allow him to appear 
with Gore and Bush. He has stated 
that the current criteria for appear
ing in the debates  15 percent 
support in a national poll  is
unfairly applied, and controlled by 
a bipartisan, private system.
Support for Naders campaign 
has fluctuated during recent 
weeks. In national polls, he has 
received endorsements consistent
ly at two to three percent, and as 
high as five percent 
(Reuters/Zogby). In contrast, 
Buchanan has been consistently 
polled at one percent. In 
Pennsylvania, polls have shown 
support as between two and five 
percent for Nader.

AB Political Speakers Chair Tanya 
Tarr hopes will encourage an 
atmosphere where CMU students 
are more likely to be politically 
informed  and start to chip away 
at the student apathy that Tarr says 
is not insurmountable.
People just stop and talk to me 
about politics all the time, said 
Tarr, a senior political science 
major. Its not like they dont know 
what the issues are ... I would not 
say that our campus is apathetic. 
People say that because maybe that 
justifies their own inactivity.
In the future, Tarr said, AB hopes 
to invite more speakers that will 
allow students to be more political
ly aware, especially on local issues. 
She said she hopes to be more spe
cific about those events in the very 
near future. We [AB] have lec
tures in mind that we hope ... dis
play an even accounting of the 
entire political spectrum, Tarr 
said. Were hoping to re-politicize 
this campus.

that there was any immediate dan
ger of stuff falling down.
He later said that a building that 
needs immediate attention is 
Margaret Morrison, where there is 
the potential for items to fall from 
the east side of the building. 
Currently, no protective scaffolding 
has been set up around the area.
The area were talking about is 
sheltered and no one would be 
there. So even if something fell 
down, nobody would be at risk, 
said Altschul.
University Architect Paul Tellers 
indicated that the recent problems 
may have been inherent problems 
related to how the buildings 
designed by Hornbostle were con
structed.
The whole reason weve having 
problems with these buildings is 
that the Hornbostle and [the admin
istration] wanted to make these 
buildings look monumental, said 
Tellers.
If these buildings were built dur
ing the Renaissance, however, they 
would have been made of all stone. 
They wouldnt have anchored 
things, they would have depended 
only on gravity, said Tellers.
With the need to update historical 
buildings could come concerns 
about maintaining a buildings 
integrity. College of Fine Arts Dean 
Martin Prekop said that he thinks 
students and faculty of the college 
agree with him that there has been 
an appropriate balance between 
preserving the integrity of the build
ing and its historical feel, and per
forming necessary renovations. In 
fact, Prekop said he was satisfied in 
general with how the buildings ren
ovations have been handled.
You could spend a million dollars 
on preserving a building. That 
means youre not spending it on 
something else. Its a value system. 
I certainly think our values are in 
the right place, said Prekop.
I think Carnegie Mellon is a place 
where we talk about quality in every 
different aspect of what we do and 
this is a part of it. You have to main
tain the integrity of this architec
ture, said Tellers.

lives figuring out what art in society
is.
! John P. Lehoczky, the acting dean 
| of H&SS for the last year, Martin 
j Prekop, the dean of the College of 
Fine Arts, and Modell submitted a 
proposal to the A.W. Mellon 
| Foundation asking for $807,000. In 
: the reports Executive Summary, the 
authors stated that, To the detri
ment of us all, American education
al institutions pay too little attention 
to integrating the study of arts and 
I humanities into a context rich with 
relevance for a contemporary social 
world undergoing economic global
ization and rapid innovations in 
high technology.
For years [faculty] have been
meeting on how to tie the colleges 
together  there have been a num
ber of faculty who have talked about 
it, said Modell.
The creators of the center envi
sion a program of expansion over 
the next three yearsthe period of 
time in which the $800,000 will be 
distributed. Through a system of 
self-assessment the center will be 
able to shape its future curriculum 
and research projects.
The center will focus on issues 
such as the artists role in society, 
censorship, funding, and public art 
issues about how art works in soci
ety, said Prekop. The focus will be 
on students in the arts and students 
who have an interest in the arts.
Prekop and former dean of H&SS 
Peter N. Stearns felt that the center 
could be part of the Universitys 
long-term strategic plan. Because of
the success of the BHA program, the 
centers creators felt the center was 
a project for the University that 
could be achieved through collabo
ration across disciplines. Further, 
Prekop admitted that there are cur
rently limitations on what each 
school can do on its own, underscor
ing the need for collaboration. It is 
a weakness that the college recog
nizes, said Prekop. By coming 
together we want to offer more to 
students.
Modell noted that the humanities 
have not been as prominent at CMU 
as disciplines that focus more on sci
ence and technology. The idea is to 
build something that has a human
istic and artistic side to bridge with 
the technological side, she said. 
We could teach art history from a 
technological standpoint. Modell 
also noted significant steps forward
in entertainment and technology.
There are an array of courses 
that everybody can take, said 
Modell. He also remarked that the 
center is going to work with Vice 
Provost Indira Nair to ensure that 
the courses are integrated properly 
into the Universitys academic cur
riculum.
Currently, the administrators are 
looking for a permanent director 
for the center, which will be housed 
in Baker Hall in some of the offices 
that the English Department is cur
rently occupying. The center will 
bring to campus conferences and 
visiting speakers who will, accord
ing to Modell, be able to supplement 
what has already taken place on the 
CMU campus. By next September, 
the center hopes to be able to offer 
some new courses to the University 
community.

New center will bridge gap 
between arts, humanities
The College of Humanities and Social 
Sciences and the College of Fine Arts are tak
ing essential steps toward creating the new 
Center for the Arts in Society. The center, 
aimed at bringing together artists, histori
ans, and social scientists, will create a bridge 
between the two colleges where faculty, stu
dents, and researchers can understand the 
role of artists and their art in our society. 
While the Bachelors of Humanities and the 
Arts program has much the same goal for 
roughly 80 students that participate in that 
major, the new center will reach out to all 
students at the University.
Art plays a vital role in our culture and all 
too often students at CMU arent aware of 
the tremendous amount of high-quality art
work that is accessible on campus, in 
Pittsburgh, and around the world. Further, 
CMU artists themselves would benefit from 
more exposure to art in the world outside of 
their concentrations, and their important 
connection to other CMU students. The cen
ter, housed in Baker Hall, will bring in post
doctorate students and faculty to conduct 
research and create courses centered on arts 
and society. In addition, supporters it will 
make significant steps forward in bringing 
together technology and art. If successful, 
the new center will provide a valuable link 
between art and the rest of the campus, with 
the potential to help all members of the 
CMU community understand the relation
ship between their work and their col
leagues work.
CMU is a place where such a center can 
flourish. With the emphasis now placed on a 
more interdisciplinary approach to educa
tion, this is an ideal time to introduce pro
grams like the Center for the Arts and 
Society at the University. In addition, many 
of the departments already have extensive
and internationally recognized research pro
grams. The center will allow vital research to 
be conducted in arts and humanities in a 
nurturing environment.
The creators of the program must be 
applauded for their efforts to include all stu
dents in this endeavor from the beginning of 
the centers inception. Currently, CMU stu
dents might view fine arts as out of touch 
with reality and foreign to their day-to-day 
lives. This center can help to alleviate this 
problem, and open the door to new collabo
ration between academic areas that have 
much to draw from each other.
However, the centers creators and admin
istrators must be careful to adhere to their 
mission  the desired results will not simply 
fall into their hands. Its organizers must 
carry through on their promise to make this 
an accommodating program. The center is 
not only important at CMU but also neces
sary, and it has the responsibility to students 
to follow through on its goals. The 
University must enact a system of checks 
and balances to make sure that the physical 
location and the centers name do not make 
it an exclusive program for a few select fac
ulty and students. The University communi
ty is now aware of this center, and it must 
keep the question of art and society within 
everyones minds.
Art is an aspect of our society that belongs 
to every single person, regardless of whether 
he or she is an artist. Regrettably, people 
who could benefit from them often view the 
fine arts as foreign and exclusive. The 
Andrew W. Mellon foundation recognized 
this when they contributed nearly one mil
lion dollars to the center, and it is the 
Universitys duty to use that grant to cut 
through the hype and bring arts and the 
humanities together for all of its students.
Forum provides opportunity 
for expression, opinions
Newspapers in general are relatively pre
dictable - they have news sections, sports 
sections, and comics, usually along with 
living and entertainment sections. Often, 
there is very little opportunity to respond 
to what appears in print. But at The Tartan, 
we find a lot of value in the exchange of 
and frequently, the clash of  ideas. The 
Forum pages are our way of fostering a free 
exchange of ideas. With Forum, we try to 
provide a spectrum of opinions that allow 
you, our readers, to be the judges.
The opinions expressed in Forum come 
in a variety of forms. Board editorials 
always appear in the leftmost columns of 
the first Forum page. They are unsigned 
because they represent a consensus opin
ion of The Tartans editorial board. While 
we believe that our editorials offer sensi
ble, accurate commentary, please feel free 
to disagree with us  we dont have a 
monopoly on truth. As a matter of fact, we 
would love to know what you think.
An excellent way to do that is by writing 
a Letter to the Editor. Letters to the Editor 
may be submitted by anybody, although 
when space gets tight, we will favor letters 
from members of the University communi
ty over letters from people outside of it. 
However, readers should realize that opin
ions in Letters to the Editor are those of the 
letters author rather than those of The 
Tartan. All letters are subject to editing for 
size and grammar (letters should not
exceed 350 words). However, we never 
edit a letter for content.
Of course, we reserve the right to reject a 
letter that we feel is libelous, obscene, or 
incoherent. But well be glad to discuss any 
letter with the author and see if we can 
reach a compromise. In order to do that, 
we need to know who you are! Were will
ing to withhold the authors name from a 
Letter to the Editor, but our Editor-in-Chief 
does need to know who wrote it. Please 
dont send us anonymous letters  it frus
trates us because we have no way to con
tact you, and it aggravates you because 
your letter doesnt get published.
A Persons Opinion is the opinion of ran
domly polled people, usually students at 
CMU, on a different topic each week. The 
people in A Persons Opinion have no affil
iation with The Tartan, and their opinions 
are in no way related to the opinions of The 
Tartan.
Columns are opinion pieces presented by 
members of the CMU community. We are 
always looking to diversify the Forum sec
tion, and we encourage students, faculty, 
and staff to write columns on the things 
that interest them. Again, the opinions 
expressed by these people are their own 
and do not reflect the opinions of The 
Tartan. You should feel free to disagree 
with them. When you send us feedback, 
you let us know that you are reading and 
thinking about The Tartan.

Letters to the Editor
Lee piece right on target
Editor:
I am glad to see that there is one article 
in the entire Internet, agreeing to what 
the U.S. government has done. This is a 
free country where everyone can express 
their opinion without fear of persecution.
However, your article, entided U.S. 
Handled Wen Ho Lee Decision Just Fine, 
fails to analyze the details of the facts and 
circumstances under which the case was 
developed. The presiding judge is the 
right person to comment on the facts and 
evidence on the case because he was the 
fact finder before the case went to trial or 
a jury.
I suggest that the author read the tran
script of the last hearing in court where 
the judge questioned the prosecutor 
before he made the comment. It seems to 
me that your article merely mirrors what 
the government contends. But there is 
some fallacy in the argument, which not 
every layman would understand without
some training in legal argument and 
logic.
In any event, I think your article is good 
in the sense that it reflects the only opin
ion opposite to the popular view at this 
time. Your article can only persuade ordi
nary people without much knowledge of 
legal reasoning and logic. It is a weak 
argument. Please remember what the 
Constitution is and the fundamental 
rights it offers that no other countries in 
the world have offered.
By the way, I am an attorney in 
California and I am a naturalized U.S. cit
izen. I was bom in China. I will welcome 
some intellectual discussion about the 
matter of Dr. Lee.

Not an arbor-trary issue
Editor:
I was very disappointed to see the
2[emr a2m[[tclue fgmeiuT
trees missing from behind the fence 
when I came back to campus this year. 
They were my favorite trees in 
Pittsburgh because of the white blos
soms in the spring. They were, 
absolutely gorgeous and always bright
ened my day.
I assumed they had been cut down 
because some had died due to the 
steambreak last year. I am angry to dis
cover (from page A7 of the Sept. 18 
Tartan) that the reason is that the Huntfamily co plained. I thought the con
tract was that nothing would be built in 
front of Hunt Library for 50 years, not 
that trees cant grow for 50 years.
There are only 10 more years left in 
this agreement. Couldnt the Hunt fam
ily have been considerate enough to let 
a few gorgeous trees live?

Civilized man no longer needs guns in society
JUJ. hr
Sharad Bajaj
Last weeks issue of The 
Tartan contained a rather 
amusing opinion expressed by 
a fiery (no pun intended) stu
dent, Frank Fleming. I am 
talking about the article enti
tled Fight Liberalism, Help 
Carnegie Mellon University 
Bear Arms. He talks about 
society being a bunch of pan
sies because people are scared 
to pick up a gun. The follow
ing quote best summarizes his 
article: The once proud call 
of Give me liberty or give me 
death has been replaced by 
Give me freedom ... unless I 
might get hurt. His point in 
the article is that firearms 
should be allowed on campus, 
as they are an asset to human 
strength.
The article (or author) has 
forgotten about one very 
important quality that distin
guishes man from wild ani
mals. Man is civilized. Lets 
take a quick look at the dictio
nary meaning: 1. Having a 
highly developed society and 
culture. 2. Showing evidence 
of moral and intellectual 
advancement; humane, ethi
cal and reasonable.
Our highly developed soci
ety and culture has evolved 
to a point in which we can 
live in a peaceful and under
standing way. Sure we need
ed technology to protect us 
from wild animals hundreds 
of years ago, but we have 
grown from just another 
species of mammal into a far 
superior one. Take a walk 
down Forbes and count how 
many tigers you see. The 
author claims that we need 
guns to protect ourselves 
from the bad people. Who 
are these bad people that we 
need to protect ourselves 
from? First of all, the word 
bad is very vague, but Ill 
assume Fleming is talking 
about the murderers and 
rapists and not the person 
who decides to give you a call 
as soon as you fall asleep.
Suppose some suspicious 
bad man is following you 
at 3 am. You, then because 
you can protect yourself, 
turn around, pull out your 
gun and ask him what he 
wants. He reaches for his 
pocket and you shoot him. 
Well, it turns out you 
dropped your wallet a quar
ter of a mile back and when 
he tried to return it you gave 
him a great reward.
Even if you think your life
might be in danger, when do 
you have the right to take 
another persons life, or do 
you have the right at all? 
People sharing Flemings 
views obviously think that 
this will reduce the number 
of murders because the bad 
people will be scared, since 
you have a way to protect 
yourself. Well guess what, a 
person who is -not scared of 
taking another persons life is 
not scared of a little toy that 
he plays with everyday. You 
just increase the number of 
people with access to the 
toys, which along with a bit 
of extra tension and stress 
turns a quarter of the popula
tion of the country into bad 
people.
Instead of lethal wild ani
mals on the road, you have 
potentially lethal wild people 
loose in society, taking man 
back in his growth path. One 
person might just save 
him/herself, but does it 
account for the number of 
accidents that will happen? 
Try to define when one can 
use a gun, and most of all, try 
sleeping after killing someone 
who you realize didnt deserve 
to die.
The final and most impor
tant point that I have to make 
will be on the equivalence of
strength and guns. According 
to Fleming, murderers are 
strong people because they 
have guns. My friend, gone are 
the days of might makes 
right. Those were the days 
before man learned to think, 
to reason, and to understand. 
Just because you carry a gun 
doesnt give you any right to 
anything. You are free, if you 
are free in your mind, if you 
are free in action, and if you 
stand by your views and dont 
bow down in front of anything. 
If you are not strong without a 
gun you will never be strong 
with it. Man is civilized, and 
strength is a far deeper con
cept than scaring away the ani
mals around you with a roar.
We dont need guns for 
strength  a gun will cause 
more harm than protect any
one. In fact, the view expressed 
in Flemings article really 
shows the type of aggression 
from which accidents occur.
And finally, to answer his 
point about recognition: 
everyone will know your name 
if you burn down Wean Hall. 
The question is, is that the type 
of recognition you want?

clared first-year student in C1T.

Fight drugs U.S. style: throw out common sense
Daniel Wood
Let me just lay a couple things out in 
the open about my past that should clari
fy certain reasons for my strong opinion 
on the issue about to be discussed ...
I am Brasilian  have been for 20 
years, and will continue to be until the 
unfortunate day of my demise. After 
reaching the age when the mind begins to 
assume interest in the affairs of the 
world, I began to learn about South 
Americas bloody, insurgent-filled past. I 
eventually entered the inevitable 
America bashing phase, where I blamed 
every economic and political problem of 
the Latin states on the imperialist 
actions of the northern world power
bully. Admittedly, it was an easy way to 
find simple explanations for complicated 
issues those countries face, and among 
South Americans, a popularly held belief. 
However, there have been clear instances 
of intervention where obvious and often
times covert operations seeking to 
remove leaders misrepresenting 
American interests were partaken on 
behalf of the U.S.
Recently, the Clinton administration
against drugs. For the past three 
decades the country has found itself 
immersed in a bloody civil war between 
guerrilla forces scattered across the 
country and the national governmentsmilitary. The revolutionary forces are 
supported by Colombian druglords 
resentful of their nations attempts at 
controlling drug trafficking. They are in 
turn closely associated with Colombias 
peasant population, whose only reliable
this futile attempt to fund an equally cor
rupt military will do little to solve the nations 
complex drug problem.

provide 1.3 billion dollars to the 
Colombian government in its war

What makes the situation even more 
See DRUGS, page A7

U.S. aid to Columbia results in misdirected funds against drugs
DRUGS ifrom page A6 
; troublesome and tense is the militarys ties 
to fanatical para-military groups dedicated 
;to the goal of annihilating the equally 
 fimmoral guerrilla troops. One of these 
groups, the Armed Self Defense Units of 
Columbia, claimed responsibility for the 
massacre of 30 peasants in 1997. Adding to 
these atrocious numbers is Amnesty 
Internationals report that an estimated two 
thousand died or disappeared in politically 
motivated killings in 1999. The result is a 
country finding itself in one of the most 
chaotic situations of Latin American histo
ry, a true quagmire of incessant fighting 
and conflicting interests.
The Clinton administration, apparently 
oblivious to the touchy situation of the
Colombian nation, is once again pushing its 
weight around by funding a military which 
itself has been accused of dabbling and prof
iting in the international drug trade. Many 
have compared the actions of the American 
government to the slow escalation of the 
countrys involvement in the beginning of 
the Vietnam War, when aid was provided to 
the then colonialist French in Vietnam. Such 
comparisons, unfortunately, are not entirely 
off: in both cases, a stubborn resistance to 
understanding the true nature of the wartorn third world countries resulted in skewed 
American attempts at solving complicated 
problems with simple solutions. General 
Charles Wilhelm, head of the Miami-based 
U.S. Southern Command, believes Columbia 
constitutes the principal problem in the
Western Hemisphere. Coupled with the 
recent loss of the Panama Canal, the 
Colombian situation bolsters the American 
governments belief in the need to intervene 
and reassert control of affairs throughout 
Latin America.
The Clinton administration fails to see 
that this futile attempt to fund an equally 
corrupt military will do little to solve the 
nations complex drug problem. Doing so 
will only help to escalate and prolong the 
intense conflict already existent in 
Colombia. The military, with increased 
funding, will reach out in its attacks 
against guerrilla forces, and in the process, 
will adversely affect the lives of peasants 
in the country side. The guerrilla will 
inevitably respond with equal and venge
ful force, thereby taking the bloodbath to 
new levels of chaotic disorder. The aid 
money is also unsuccessful in addressing 
the main problem of the Colombian drug 
trade: the demand and high consumption 
of these illicit substances in the U.S. 
Instead of funding a questionable 
Colombian military, the 1.3 billion dollars 
should receive directed focus in establish
ing rehabilitation and alternatives to 
incarceration. The American government 
needs to realize that the core of its drug 
problems do not arise initially from 
Colombia, but within the borders of the 
United States.

by John Hursh
Junior Staff Writer
America is a sports nation. American ath
letes are worshipped. Professional athletes 
make millions of dollars, while teachers and 
social workers are grossly underpaid. We 
rationalize the childish or violent behavior of 
athletes citing the pressure of big time 
sports, youth, or public misunderstanding as 
the cause of these outbreaks.
Not that I am any different. As morally 
conscientious as I try to be, I cant help but to 
cheer for Latrell Spreewell. I am simply more 
interested in watching Spree push the ball up 
the court and slash to the hole than the fact 
that he threatened the life of his former 
coach and throttled his trachea.
Another example of the absurdity of big 
time sports is the hoopla regarding the ter
mination of longtime Indiana University 
coach Bobby Knight. As a Hoosier, I can give 
firsthand credibility to the insanity sur
rounding both high school and collegiate 
basketball in Indiana. The firing of Knight 
made national headlines. Numerous death 
threats have been made to multiple universi
ty personnel, especially the president of the 
university and his wife, a university profes
sor. Talking to my parents the other day, I 
also learned that their high school friend of 
years past, one of the universitys vice-presidents, has also received death threats from 
hard core Knight supporters. This university 
official now has the enviable task of finding 
Knights replacement.
Given this prevalent attitude towards 
big time college and professional sports in 
our country, should we be surprised that 
youth sports are as warped as they are?
The July 24th issue of Sports Illustrated 
devoted 10 pages to Out of Control. The 
article addressed the incredible vio
lence that has recently plagued youth 
sports. The focal point of the article 
was indictment of Thomas Junta for 
the manslaughter of Michael Costin.
Both fathers had sons 12 years old or 
younger participating in an informal 
skate-around near Boston. Costin was 
supervising the skate-around when 
Junta complained about an elbow 
that Costins son delivered to the 
nose of his son. A minor scuffle 
between the men ensued with Junta 
being ejected from the rink. Later on, 
the men happened to cross paths at a 
Coke machine where Junta beat 
Costin so severely that Costin would 
spend two days in a coma before he 
died. The crme de la crme of the 
entire incident was that Costins 
three sons were witness to the attack 
and begged for Junta to stop. 
Reportedly Costins face was so dis
figured that his children did not rec
ognize him.
This is not a condemnation of Junta 
though. I recognize that good people 
can make terrible mistakes that haunt 
them for the rest of their lives. This is 
more on an invitation to think about 
the absurd amount of power and influence 
that sports wield in our society. Clearly, 
sports are a two-way street. Participation in 
a wide range of sports has been responsible 
for innumerable positive events in my life. 
As the same time, there has been abuse of 
privilege and unfair preference.

read, the more it seems that this is a naive 
position to hold. With illegal drug-use find
ings cropping up in nearly every Olympic 
sport, the pressure to win outweighs the 
responsibility of competing fairly. The pres
sure to win is huge in the Olympics, especial
ly for the world powers, where the Olympics 
become a stage to showcase international
power and prestige. However, within 
American culture, Olympic pressure pales in 
comparison to the pressure of profes
sional sports, where billions of dol
lars are generated each year.
There is a dark side to the American 
obsession of being the best that is sel
dom talked about. A high school stu
dent who spends the same amount of 
time studying mathematics as a little 
basketball star shooting hoops, is 
stuck with a label much less appeal
ing than dedicated. The push for 
greatness in sports is also responsible 
for young lives being crushed when 
they find out that there is someone, 
somewhere, a litde better than they 
are. This dark side claims the child
hoods of tennis prodigies, gymnastic 
virtuosos, and runners as they burn 
out before high school.
On the other hand, it is naive to 
think that any of this will change. 
America loves a winner. Coupled 
with the money and power at stake 
any reasonable discussion about 
sports can already be ruled out. As 
the martyred sage of our genera
tion Tupac said, Thats just the 
way it is. Truer words have never 
been spoken, although it is mindboggling to realize that all of these 
issues can be traced back to some of the 
most impractical activities ever conceived 
of.

Elections seen as a joke, reflection of political apathy on campus
Andy Baker
With four weeks gone in this 
semester so far, I sit here at my 
computer, feeling a bit apathetic 
about the November election. 
Should the fate of this nation fall 
to George W. Bush, governor of 
my home state of Texas, or Vice 
President Al Gore? Polls show 
that the two have a commanding 
lead over third (and fourth) party 
candidates such as Ralph Safety 
First Nader and Pat Hitler Was 
My Hero Buchanan. Meanwhile, 
Gore and Bush, whom supporters 
fondly call Dubya, are spending 
millions of dollars in soft money 
blasting each others proposals 
and character. Is it really any 
wonder why I, along with most of 
the registered voters in this great, 
but highly jaded, nation of ours 
feel so out of touch with the polit
ical process?
These days, we cant even get 
half of the voters out to the polls. 
Voter turnout in the primaries 
this year was the second lowest 
since 1960 - behind only 1996 
(http://www.voter.com). Indeed, 
in statistics of voter turnout in 
1995, the United Sates placed 
20th with only 38% of registered 
voters voting. The United 
Kingdom fared better, in 13th 
place with, get this, 76% 
(http://www.fairvote.org/turnout 
/compare, htm). Only seven 
places higher in voter turnout, 
and they had twice the turnout 
that we did.
Why do we find it so hard to 
get people to vote? One possibili
ty that has been theorized is that 
voters feel that their votes dont 
mean anything anymore. This is 
known as the one vote doesnt 
make a difference syndrome. 
Paradoxically, with the low voter 
turnout, one vote really can 
make a difference, and political 
groups have been using that to 
their advantage on numerous
occasions, such as local elections 
where turnout is so pathetically 
low that write-in candidacies 
become viable. Apparently, one 
vote doesnt make a difference 
isnt the only explanation.
Another common excuse for not 
voting is the claim that the avail
able candidates are just multiple 
flavors of vanilla. Politicians these 
days are so sensitive to polls that it 
has been joked that they dont even 
sneeze without checking the polls 
first. Is it any wonder, then, why 
Bore and Dubya are both talk
ing about things like school 
accountability, campaign finance 
reform, and health care reform, 
and that their proposals all sound 
so similar?
But there is one other point to 
consider, and that is the viability 
of third parties. For much of our 
nations history, there have been 
only two candidates to choose 
from in major elections. Thus, 
voters have been conditioned to 
only having two choices, and 
lately the choices have been ...
well, less than stellar. Because of 
this, third parties consider them
selves lucky to even be on the 
ballot in most states. So voters 
see it not as a choice of whos 
best qualified for the job, but a 
choice between the lesser of two 
(or more) evils, and this, more 
than any other factor, leads them 
to shun elections.
Kids see this apathy as they 
grow up, and it becomes 
ingrained into them that their 
vote doesnt matter, that elections 
are more the lesser of many evils 
than an important democratic 
decision, etc. And so they become 
apathetic themselves when they 
get to voting age and on into col
lege. I can think of no better 
example of this than right here at 
CMU. In the spring of 1999, 
turnout for the student body elec
tions at CMU stood at about 13%. 
Last spring, turnout plummeted 
to just 5% of the student body 
participating.
Because of the low turnout, 
Optimus Prime took second place
in the race for student body pres
ident, but was disqualified 
because he is not an activitiesfee paying student. In the same 
election, Mr. T ended up in a four
way tie for fourth place, before 
being disqualified for the same 
reason as Optimus Prime. Mind 
you, I am not above invalid writeins myself, having written in 
Jerry Springer in one of these 
elections, but if voter turnout 
continues to plummet, Mr. 
Springer could very well win an 
election on this campus. This 
bodes ill for the larger elections, 
where apathy can lead to election 
of an official who, if people had 
actually gone out and voted, 
wouldnt even be considered. 
Does this mean that Optimus 
Prime, Mr. T, or Jerry Springer 
stand a chance at becoming the 
43rd President of the United 
States? Only time will tell.
Andy Baker is a junior informa
tion systems major  if you really 
care about that.

THE TARTAN  SEPTEMBER 25. 2000Ail
Chicago beats womens soccer
Jeff Cullers/Junior Staff
A University of Chicago player defends against the the Tartans offensive drive. The men's soccer team was 
down 2-0 after one period, but came back to win 3-2. The team plays Penn State-Behrend at home on Tuesday.
SOCCER, from page A12 
McMorrow worked effortlessly 
together to get the ball in the net. 
Celone scored the first goal with an 
assist by McMorrow; later, 
McMorrow and Celone switched 
roles for an encore. A defensive 
Washington and Jefferson team 
could not come up with enough 
offense to get by the hot Tartan 
midfielders and backs.
The dire situation of the oppos
ing team was soon reflected in the 
conduct of its fans. Not only did 
they become rude and unruly, but 
they also started coaching their 
players from the sidelines.
One woman spent the entire first 
half yelling at her daughter, a for
ward starter for Washington and 
Jefferson, telling her where to 
stand, reminding her to stay wide, 
and letting everyone know exactly 
how badly she was playing. Later, 
at the end of the first half, just 
before the horn sounded, a man 
from the same group shouted,
Dont worry, youll get her back 
next time.
Washington and Jefferson, how
ever, never did strike back. The 
Tartans defense proved to be too 
strong for their style of play. Their 
forwards lagged behind. The 
Tartans took advantage of this 
early, and got the win.
On Saturday, now with a 3-3 
record, the Tartans faced one of 
their toughest games this season, 
against the University of Chicago. 
Chicago has always been strong in 
the UAA, and the Tartans were 1-7 
against them through 1999.
Better weather did not increase 
the number of fans, though. At the 
start of the game, there were 
eleven people in the bleachers and 
a scattering of fans on the benches 
near West Wing.
Despite the poor turnout, the 
Tartans played a tough game from 
beginning to end. The team played 
defensively against the obviously 
bigger Chicago team.
Early in the first half, excitement 
filled the air as the Tartans nearly 
scored off a corner. Later, near the 
end of the half, the Chicago goalie 
made several good saves, prevent
ing the Tartans from scoring. At the 
half, neither of the teams had 
scored yet.
The second half was just as tight. 
Chicago -kept pressuring the Tartan 
defense,' which did not let up. At 
12:17 in the second half, however, 
Chicago scored off a direct free 
kick. Goalkeeper Maya Nigrosh fell 
to the ground as the ball sailed cen
timeters over her fingertips. This 
goal fired up the Tartan offense, 
but it also inspired the Chicago 
defense to play tougher. That single 
goal was all Chicago needed to win 
the game, 1-0.
The next home game for the 
womens soccer team is Tuesday at 
8 pm, against local La Roche 
College. Next, the Tartans travel to 
visit UAA rival Washington 
University on Sunday.
Tartans recover against Alfred sPrts shorts
FOOTBALL, from page A12 
yards. He finished the game with 
31 yards on four carries.
Zimpfer continued to run the 
ball, which seemed to benefit the 
team more than his taking to the 
air. Once again, the offense sus
tained a drive that eventually put 
points on the scoreboard  this 
time in the form of a 21-yard field 
goal by first-year lacker Michael 
Palmer. He was en route to a per
fect kicking day, hitting all his 
attempts and also booting a kickoff through the end zone.
The next scoring strike came at 
3:26 in the second quarter, via the 
Zimpfer-McLaughlin connection. 
On a gutsy third-and-two call, 
assistant coach Rich Erdelyi decid
ed to fake a buck sweep and head 
deep. Zimpfer connected with 
McLaughlin on a long 67-yard 
reception that put CMU up 17-7. 
McLaughlin got back into the 
swing of things this game with 4 
receptions, for a total of 80 yards.
The Saxons were determined to 
answer the 17 straight points put 
up by the Tartans, and they did 
just that on their next drive. The 
sneaky flea-flicker play was pulled 
out of Alfreds playbook and that 
brought them down to the CMU 
12-yard line. The 44-yard strike 
led to a screen pass that scored on 
the next play.
Kicking off, the Tartans were in 
jeopardy of being scored on during 
Alfreds first drive of the second 
half. Saxon running back Chuck 
Fortuna was the head of the attack, 
eventually totaling 32 yards on four 
carries throughout the contest.
However, the drive came up 
short when Tartan defensive back 
Matt Noretto intercepted a pass
from Alfred quarterback Todd 
Zandrowicz (19-36 passing for 
276 yards in the game). The 
defense, with a tremendous collec
tive team effort, stepped it up in 
the second half, holding Alfred 
scoreless four times in a row.
Carnegie -Mellon was the next 
team to score with a one-yard 
plunge once again by Urbanczyk. 
He showed how difficult he has 
been to stop, bringing his touch
down total to seven for the year.
With 4:05 to play in the fourth 
quarter and time running short, 
Zandrowicz found Jesse Raynor in 
the back of the end zone for a 15- 
yard touchdown pass. That 
brought Alfred within a field goal, 
21-24. Knowing the clock was 
their enemy now, the Saxons were 
looking to get the ball back after a 
quick defensive stop.
The Saxon defense made that 
happen with help from Zimpfers 
incomplete passes. Senior Matt 
Youngs punt pinned the Saxons 
deep in their own territory. 
Looking to go the distance of the 
field for a score, the ball was 
snapped over the Saxon quarter
backs head and out of the end 
zone. A safety was awarded to the 
Tartans, making the score 26-21 
in their favor.
With 1:39 left, and Carnegie 
Mellon leading by five and receiv
ing a kickoff, the game appeared 
to be wrapped up. However, a suc
cessful onside kick by the Saxons 
put them back in the game. They 
worked down the field quickly and 
finally came upon fourth down on 
the CMU 11-yard line.
It was do or die, and as 
Zandrowicz scrambled for a first 
down, junior linebacker Mike
Hubbert stepped up in crunch 
time, stuffing him with a huge hit. 
The Tartans ran out the clock on 
their possession and secured their 
victory, with a final score of 26-21. 
Hubbert had six total tackles for 
the game, leading the Tartans 
defensive charge.
Coming off a tough loss, we 
rebounded well with this win, 
said Lackner. We showed a lot of 
character.
Volleyball goes 3-1 in Rochester
The womens volleyball team 
played four matches this weekend 
at the first UAA Round-Robin tour
nament of the year, held in 
Rochester, NY. The Tartans com
pleted the two-day competition 
with a 3-1 record, bringing their 
overall record to 9-7.
Coach Julie Webb praised her
team, saying that it played very 
well, despite the fact that most of 
the teams that they played were 
not the strongest in the UAA.
The Tartans defeated Chicago 
and Johns Hopkins convincingly, 
without losing a game. They lost a 
difficult match to Emory, with a 
score of 7-15,17-15,14-16, 3-15. 
The match with Emory, a longtime 
CMU rival, drained the Tartans 
physically and emotionally, though 
they still pulled out their final
match against NYU in four games.
Over the weekend, in addition to 
stellar individual performances, 
the team averaged over 22 digs per 
game, and is now average 19 digs 
per game for the season, the high
est average the team has ever 
achieved.
Overall, it was a great weekend 
for us, said Webb.

Franklin & Marshall (0-3) v.
CMU (3-1,1-0 UAA) (Saturday,
1 pm, home. WRCT 88.3 fm)
Last meeting: 1996, F&M 28, 
CMU 7
The skinny: Despite shaking up 
his assistant coaching staff after a 
2-8 record in 1999 and third 
straight season with a . sub-par 
winning percentage, Tom Gilburg 
(26th season) is living his football 
nightmare. F&M has endured 
three defeats by a combined mar
gin of 125-7.
Watch for: Nobody on F&M. A 
young group of offensive linemen 
should receive a difficult lesson 
from a CMU defense that was in 
the backfield many times against 
Alfred. If Nick Zitelli continues to 
be bothered by a bum ankle, 
Michael Hubbert (six tackles last 
week) will be all over the field.
Result: The only thing prevent
ing CMU from scoring 70 points is 
its clock-control offense. Of 
course, yours truly expected CMU 
to purify the Saxons.
Knights firing raises questions
KNIGHT, from page A12 
his superiors at the university, espe
cially athletic director Clarence 
Doninger. So, rather than facing the 
situation, he merely declined to 
speak to his boss. He cancelled 
speaking engagements he had 
made to represent the university, 
and stopped teaching his basketball 
class. He even stopped wearing 
Indiana gear, not wanting to repre
sent the school that had paid his 
checks for the past 29 years.
The most ironic aspect of the 
whole situation is the defense given 
Knight by his supporters. This sup
port basically boils down to the 
idea that the coach teaches his 
players how to be men. What type 
of man can you learn to be by 
watching Knight? One that throws 
temper tantrums when things dont 
go your way  such as when he 
smashed a vase against a wall in the 
vicinity of a secretary with whom 
he was frustrated. One that doesnt 
respect authority  failing to com
municate professionally with his 
boss, assaulting a Puerto Rican 
police officer, and verbally abusing 
any referee who dars get in the
way of a victory by his team. One 
that lies and encourages his sup
porters to lie when he is accused of 
a misdeed, as in the smear cam
paign run against Neil Reed until a 
videotape showed that Knight did 
in fact place his hands around the 
players neck. I guarantee you that 
coach Knight would never get 
along with a player who grew up to 
be the same type of man that he is.
There are many other specific 
reasons why Knight has been 
praised as a coach. Among them 
are his players nearly perfect grad
uation rate, his spotless program, 
and the fact that he has won three 
national titles. As Chris Rock would 
say, these are things a coach is sup
posed to do. Okay, maybe the 
national titles are exceptions to 
this, but the fact that Knight is 
being lauded for graduating his 
players and not running afoul of 
the NCAA is a great indictment of 
the state of college hoops today. 
Doing them in no way excuses his 
transgressions in other areas. If I 
do all my homework, dont cheat, 
and study hard for exams, this 
would not excuse me for going into
President Cohons office, throwing 
a temper tantrum at his secretary 
and verbally assaulting him. I 
would be out of this school before a 
new coat of paint could be applied 
to the fence.
Coach Knight will return in the 
near future to guide another pro
gram, I have no doubt about that. 
If Jerry Tarkanian and Eddie 
Sutton could get jobs after their 
debacles at UNLV and Kentucky, 
respectively, then there is no way 
Knight will go unemployed for 
long if he wishes to work again, 
and he has indicated that he does. 
I just hope that he has learned a 
lesson from this entire situation, 
and does not go on to further tar
nish his reputation.
Knights supporters have always 
been fearful that he would do 
something stupid to ruin his legacy, 
and it is apparent that he has done 
just that. Knight has a great record 
as a head coach and has done many 
positive things, but he will forever 
be linked to coaches like Woody 
Hayes; men whose downfalls were 
caused by an inability to control 
themselves.

Knights
departure
overdue
Full Court Press
by Pete Patterson
Since the firing of Indiana 
University basketball coach Bobby 
Knight, countless passionate words 
have been written either for or 
against the embattled coach. This 
is a situation with no apparent mid
dle ground, no room for compro
mise. His backers lament that 
Knights firing represents a lower
ing of the bar in America, the work 
of jealous men and pampered stu
dents unable to stand up to the rig
orous standards that are so quickly 
disappearing in this country. 
Those who support IUs action 
claim Knight and his antics should 
have gone a long time ago.
I must admit I am in the latter 
camp. To me, the most fitting thing 
about the immediate situation sur
rounding the firing is the irony of it 
all. The direct impetus for the fir
ing came when Knight grabbed the 
arm of a student who had made a 
flippant remark to him, and pro
ceeded to give him a loud lesson in 
manners, either profanity-laced or 
not, depending who you believe. I 
wonder if Knight listened to what 
he was telling the young Indiana 
freshman, because he could have 
learned a lesson from himself. 
Unfortunately, he did not take heed 
when the university figuratively 
grabbed Knight by the arm and 
urged him to act civilly by issuing 
the zero tolerance policy in May.
Even more ironic is Knights insis
tence that he never understood 
what zero tolerance meant. This 
is a man whose life is the epitome of 
zero tolerance. He does not tolerate 
anyone or anything that stands in 
his way. Even since the issuing of 
. the edict, the coach has demon
strated this. He felt embarrassed by

Tartans bounce back with 26-21 victory over Alfred
by Preston Treichel
Junior Staffwriter
The Tartans got back on track 
this past Saturday in their victory 
over New York opponent Alfred 
University. In this weeks contest, 
played in dark and damp condi
tions, Carnegie Mellon seemed 
unfazed by last weeks setback 
against Bethany.
Last week we did not have a 
good game, head coach Rich 
Lackner said. We needed to get
back to the basics of blocking and 
tackling.
Going in, both teams were sitting 
with 2-1 records and hungry for a 
win. The game proved to be an 
exciting battle, but CMU ended up 
pulling it out in the final minutes.
If the first couple minutes were 
going to be an indication of the 
direction of the game, then it 
would not have been a pretty story 
for the Tartans. In the first play 
from the line of scrimmage, quar
terback Eric Zimpfer threw an ugly 
interception. The ball was intend
ed for running back Drew Garrod 
but did not reach its mark.
The Saxons capitalized immedi
ately on that turnover and 
marched right in for the score, on a 
20-yard scamper by running back 
George Eason, who had 15 carries 
and 66 yards for the game. The 
Tartans hardly had time to blink 
before the scoreboard quickly lit 
up to display 7-0.
Despite falling behind so early, 
the Tartans maintained their poise. 
After both offenses were stopped, 
CMU started to pick up steam and
get things rolling. Despite a rough 
opening, the offense began to turn 
it around, mostly due to the scram
bling of Zimpfer.
Most of Zimpfers runs are not 
planned, Coach Lackner said. 
The majority of them are run-pass 
options, and he makes the reads by 
himself.
Zimpfer led the Tartan charge 
toward the end zone, picking up. 
most of his 88 rushing yards in the 
first successful Tartan drive of the 
day. He completed the game with 
14 rushing attempts, and was 8 of
17 in the air for 102 yards.
After a key fourth down conver
sion on the 13 yard line of the

Last Thursday night, the 
womens soccer team looked to 
pick up a win over Washington and 
Jefferson at home, having just lost 
a 2-1 overtime game to Marietta 
on Monday. Those who attended 
the game were not only treated to a 
dominating performance by the 
Tartans, but witnessed the specta
cle of the Washington and 
Jefferson fans as well.
The Tartans started the game 
well and continuously built 
strength as time went on. 
Washington and Jefferson had an 
undesirable record of 2-6 entering 
the game. The Tartans had oppor
tunities from the beginning, spend
ing most of the game on the 
Washington and Jefferson end. By 
the time the game finished, both 
Tartan goalies had seen time in 
goal, though there wasnt much 
action to speak of. Carnegie 
Mellon controlled the game and 
defeated Washington and 
Jefferson, 2-0.
The two goals of the night came 
less than 15 minutesinto the first 
half, within one minute of each 
other. Senior captain Kim Celone 
and sophomore Melissa

but the major leagues could use tweaking
with a perfecdy respectable base
ball score of 6-3. Seven baseball 
games played that day saw more 
total points scored than this football
game, and a more accurate compar
ison would have been the 15-10 
Atlanta-Carolina game.

scores, pitchers are getting hit (lit
erally) more than ever. Come back
ers will always be a part of the 
game, but no less than five pitchers 
were hit by hard line drives last 
week, two of them in the head. Unjuicing the ball is probably not an 
option, but removing the advan
tages given to hitters at the end of 
the dead-ball era is certainly within 
reason. For starters, raise the 
mound back up to 18 inches and 
call the high strike. Ever since Bob 
Gibson prompted the lowering of 
the mound with a 1.12 ERA in 
1968, pitchers have been at an 
increasing disadvantage.
Also, its time for the designated 
hitter to go. Originally a gimmick to 
increase offensive production, the 
DH has overstayed its welcome, as 
have many of the players who now 
man the position. Its painful to 
watch formerly productive players 
like Jose Canseco hang on as DHs 
long after they should have retired. 
Sure, Canseco still hits the odd
home run, but he didnt get the 
nickname Jose Can-Strikeout for 
nothing. And did you see what hap
pened when he tried to justify him
self by playing right field two 
weeks ago? He lost a routine pop 
fly in the sun and watched the ball; 
land a full six yards away from his I 
position. This is not what baseball! 
is supposed to be about.

A View From The Bleachers
by Matt Brun
Down to one week to go in the 
regular season, and the American 
League wild card race is almost def
initely going to go down to the final 
day. Im getting tired of writing 
about that, though, so Im going to 
just wait and see how it all turns 
out. Unfortunately, that leaves me 
without a topic for this column, 
and after the long season, Im run
ning out of ideas. So, instead of 
focusing on a single topic, I thought 
Id discuss a few things, both good 
and bad, that got my attention dur
ing the season.
First theres the wild card itself. 
Not the races to see which teams 
get it, but the realignment that 
forced its inception in the first 
place. It was five years ago that we 
first saw a wild card team in the 
playoffs, and I still cant decide 
whether I think the wild card con
cept is good or bad.
On the one hand, the wild card 
has certainly added some extra 
drama to the final month of the 
season, especially this year. Under 
the old two-division format, the 
White Sox and Yankees would have 
locked up the AL races long ago, 
though Toronto and Cleveland may 
have pushed New York a little in the 
old Eastern division.
The NL would have seen a similar 
situation with a little bit of a race 
between Atlanta and San Francisco 
in the West, but no competition for 
St. Louis in the East.
On the other hand, I dislike the 
idea that the loser of the OaklandSeattle battle out west could still 
make the playoffs as the wild card. 
If both teams are sufficiently ahead 
of the Indians with a couple games 
to go, there wont be any incentive 
to play hard for the division title 
since both will be assured of mak
ing the playoffs anyway.
The incredibly stupid rule that 
two teams from the same division 
cant play each other in the first 
round also lessens the value of the 
wild card in my mind. I think Ive 
mentioned this in a previous col
umn, but if youre going to have, a 
wild card in the playoffs, you have 
to make sure that you reward the 
teams that did win their divisions 
to make sure those wins still mean
something. That means letting the 
team with the best record in the 
league play the wild card team with 
home-field advantage, rather than 
randomly assigning the match-ups 
to avoid divisional match-ups. 
Personally, I think its much worse 
to have two teams from the same 
division playing for the right to go 
to the World Series than for them 
to meet in the first round. (On a 
related note, why is the first round 
called, the Divisional Series if no 
teams from the same division are 
playing each other?)
Somewhat along the lines of 
whos going to make the playoffs, 
something needs to be done about 
the big market-small market divi
sion. Clearly, the best solution 
would be a hard salary cap that 
gives every team an equal shot at 
all the big-name free agents. This 
has worked wonders keeping every 
team competitive in the NFL, but 
unfortunately theres no way base
ball will ever see a similar cap 
implemented. The 1994 players 
strike that cancelled the World 
Series showed that the players 
union will not stand for a salary cap 
of any land, and theres no reason 
to think tjiey wouldnt do it again.
In light of this, the only solution 
that seems viable is some form of 
revenue sharing where some per
centage of each teams profits 
would go to a collective pool that is 
then divided up based on need. This 
would let teams like the Expos see 
some of the profits from the insane
ly large (I dont even remember the 
dollar amount, its so big) TV deal 
George Steinbrenner just negotiat
ed for the Yankees. The owners con
tinually cry out for some sort of 
help, and revenue sharing is a solu
tion by which they could take the 
initiative and help themselves.
Switching topics completely now, 
I feel the need to cry out on behalf 
of all the pitchers (with the possible 
exceptions of Pedro Martinez, 
Randy Johnson, and Greg 
Maddux). They need help, bad. 
Lets take last Sundays action as a 
perfect example of the current state 
of offense in the major leagues. As a 
reference point, well use the 
Packers-Eagles game that finished

Mystery Science Theater 3000 star Mike Nelson mocks, creates bad movies
by Andy Francis
Arts & Living Co-Editor
Television, film, and music are filled 
with works commonly referred to as cult 
hits  bands, movies, and shows that, 
rather than attracting a mainstream audi
ence, pull in a small but strongly devoted 
army of fans. Where Phish and Fugazi fit 
the bill in pop music and The Rocky Horror 
Picture Show still packs the midnight 
moviehouses, Mystery Science Theater 
Hiiis sharp writing and incisive wit 
makes it the show for loyal fans who love its 
ruthless dissecting of old B-grade films. 
Much of the credit for the shows sensibili
ty has to go to head writer and sometimes 
star of the show Mike Nelson, who deliv
ered a laid-back yet strikingly funny lecture 
Monday night in support of his new book 
Movie Megacheese.
Nelsons talk was loosely organized 
around his number one subject: bad 
movies. A sizable portion of the speech was 
dedicated to skewering notoriously lame 
flicks like Anaconda (Jon Voights accent 
makes him sound more like the Frito 
Bandito than anything South American) 
and The Island of Dr. Moreau (Marlon 
Brando, looking like Big Boy in the
Mike Nelsons book Movie Megacheese 
picks up where his TV show leaves off.
Caribbean.) Included among these parts 
were a number of readings from Movie 
Megacheese, and though listening to some
one read from a book isnt generally a bar
rel of laughs, Nelsons edgy slant and dead
pan delivery made sure the passages were
consistently hilarious.
Throughout the talk, Nelson wrung big 
laughs from his easygoing manner and 
Conan OBrien-esque sense of self-depre
cating humor. Over the course of the pre
sentation, Nelson seemed to smile practi
cally every second, as if he was enjoying 
the talk along with the rest of us. He joked 
early on that the CMU people only let him 
in because they thought he was tennis star 
Stefan Edberg and jokingly boasted that he 
had previously been on camera in front of 
dozens of people. On the very few occa
sions one of his jokes didnt hit, Nelson was 
quick to offer an apology or make fun of his 
own joke. This easygoing manner gave the 
audience the feeling that Nelson was the 
everyman to whom everyone can relate.
The highlights of Nelsons performance 
were definitely his carving up of some of 
his favorite bad movies. He retained the 
wisecracking, absurdity-detecting sensibil
ities of Mystery Science Theater 3000, creat
ing the sense that he mocks movies like he 
does simply because its fun for him. His 
first foray into this was the recent supermodels-as-bartenders flick Coyote Ugly  
Nelson informed the audience that star 
Piper Perabo should never again have her 
voice or image recorded. Shortly after 
that, he delved into the Patrick Swayze
vehicle Roadhouse, which he described as 
the best bad movie of all time. What 
makes Nelsons style so consistently funny 
is how he finds the ridiculousness in even 
the most innocuous dialogue, and reads 
the lines in such a normal, even tone that it 
dawns on the listener just how stupid they 
really are. Roadhouse was the consummate 
example; Swayzes inane lines from the 
film, like nobody wins a fight and pain 
dont hurt seem tailored to Nelsons sense 
of humor.
From time to time during his talk, Nelson 
brought out Movie Megacheese, plugging it 
effectively but in an amusing, tongue-incheek manner. He touched on recent 
movies like Wild Things (Denise Richards 
breasts star as Kelly Van Ryans breasts), 
The Bridges of Madison County (Like most 
people who end up in Iowa, hes lost), and 
Patch Adams (Rejected by all adults, Patch 
parades his act before terminally sick chil
dren) . Though he picks almost relentless
ly on movies, he never seems mean or abra
sive, just perceptive and a little bit amazed 
that Hollywood still puts out bad movies 
after having so many years to practice. His 
tone, falling somewhere between childlike 
wonder and grownup cynicism, is perfectly 
suited for his material.
Several times, Nelson brought out a set
of index cards and read his strategy for 
sure-fire box-office hits, which let him poke 
some fun at typical Tinseltown marketing 
strategies. He let audience members each 
read a segment from a farcical movie pitch 
like Jean Claude Van-Damme stars as ... 
a dreadlocked computer science major 
who ... befriends a sperm whale named 
Tyler in this ... flat-out ass-kicking movienamed ... Hot and Saucy ... Force. 
Nelson did several other bits like this that 
got big laughs not only from the material, 
but also from his comical interactions with 
the volunteers he chose to read for him. His 
skill with the crowd extended into a really , 
long Q & A session afterwards, where he 
deftly answered inane questions like If a 
bad movie is on at the same time as MST3K, 
what are we supposed to do? by sidestep
ping them or providing sarcastic answers. 
(Well, theres this ancient piece of tech
nology called a VCR...)
From start to finish, Mike Nelson gave a 
very amusing and enjoyable talk. Though 
technically he was promoting his new 
book, it seemed as if he was there primari
ly to entertain, and that he did. Poking fun 
at bad movies, wacky audience members,' 
and anything else he could get his hands 
on, Nelsons insight and wit are welcome 
back at CMU anytime.
Visiting author Hayes opens Adamson 
writer series with Muscular lecture
he was happy to receive the 
awards, but that he considers 
them a result more of luck than 
of talent.
After hearing last Thursdays 
reading, however, the packed 
crowd that filled the Adamson 
wing would most likely agree that 
Hayes was simply being humble 
about his work. Most poets tell 
you how good they are, but 
[Hayes] said it with his poems, 
said Gerald Costanzo, a professor 
of English and creative writing. 
Terrance is one of the best young 
poets in America.
Hayes kept the audience 
engaged throughout the reading, 
partially by making humorous 
asides. After reading Lady Sings 
the Blues, a poignant poem about 
how Hollywood glamorizes the 
often gritty lives of celebrities, 
Hayes balanced that effect by ask
ing if the audience knew of the 
1970s film of the same name star
ring Diana Ross as Billie Holiday. 
When they responded yes, he 
joked, It was a Motown movie, so 
you knew it was doomed from the 
start.
I thought that the humor bal
anced the gravity of some of the 
poems, said Sally Stewart, a 
junior creative writing major. 
Stewart, who had read Muscular 
Music before attending the perfor
mance, also praised Hayes for 
bringing the music of his poems to 
life during the reading.
Many of Hayess poems involve 
music in various capacities. Some 
poems are about the musicians
themselves, like Boxcar, which 
is about jazz legend John' 
Coltranes notoriously long solos.  
Others use music in the poems 
themselves, like a newer selection, 
entitled M.C. which makes sev-, 
eral hip-hop references and even, 
includes a beatbox segment.
When asked about the cultural 
references in his work, Hayes' 
responded, I just write about 
whats interesting to me. Were 
the MTV generation. He also 
added that poems that center on 
cultural characters, such as 
Sonnet for Mr. T, are never just 
about those characters. He said 
that he is interested in what char
acters like Mr. T represent to him, 
and that is what gives these 
poems staying power.
Examining such characters is 
one of Hayes obsessions, like 
painting, and music, and most 
recently anagrams. In fact, Hayes 
ended the reading by reciting a 
number of his newer poems that 
are based on his obsession with 
this word game, often found in 
newspapers, wherein one must 
take a given word and think of all 
the other words that could be 
made by using the letters in the 
original. Abductor, Saintly, 
and Masculine were just a few of 
the powerful pieces recited.
Costanzo claims that this new 
work is an impressive turning 
point. Its very hard to move 
away from autobiography into 
strictly looking at language, he 
said, concluding that were look
ing at a real talent.
TOC fashion leads away from formal 
attire towards more casual wardrobes
by Blake Engel
Personnel Manager
Each year, on the runways of 
Wiegand Gymnasium and Rangos 
Hall, fashion history is made. CMU 
students go to their closets and 
sport their choicest threads, only 
their Sunday best. And hey, its all 
worth it when its for the sake of 
making the right contacts at the 
TOC  right?
Its quite a phenomenon to see 
people who usually wear Def 
Leppard T-shirts in three-piece 
suits. Students size each other up, 
wondering where all the dirt and 
grime went.
What possesses students to sud
denly jump out of their daily attire 
and into this once-in-a-year 
wardrobe? I dont know  tech 
people dont like to dress up, 
observed Jeff Sarnat, a junior in 
computer science. Its important 
to be comfortable, and the compa
nies dont care at all.
Sarnat was the exception to the 
rule last Thursday when he showed 
up at the job fair in his streetclothes. I was glad I was feeling 
comfortable in my normal clothes 
and not in a hot suit! he said.
Sophomore Russian studies 
major Stephanie Hepner  who 
also went sans chic  noticed a 
difference in student and recruiter 
attire. All the recruiters were 
casually dressed but everyone else 
was wearing their tuxes, practical
ly.
CEO of CollegeHire.com Jeff 
Daniel explains: The tech world is 
not formally dressed. [Werel not 
wearing a coat and tie to work; we 
wear shorts and sandals and Tshirts. Daniel himself was dressed 
in a polo shirt for the big day.
Clearly the recruiters have the 
high ground in the deal. They are 
familiar with a changing work 
environment where anything 
above khakis is taboo. Still, some 
students, like sophomore comput
er science major Gil Tolle, have 
their reasons for coming looking 
sharp. It might make them take 
you more professionally. I dont 
like dressing up either, but I 
brought a suit with me [to CMU], 
and this is the only time in the

Last Thursday evening, awardwinning poet Terrance Hayes 
kicked off this years Adamson 
Visiting Writers Series by reading 
passages from his debut book, 
Muscular Music, as well as some 
newer selections that have yet to 
be published. Hayes used a com
bination of energy, humor and 
music to deliver his poems, which 
have as subjects everything from 
musical legends like Miles Davis 
and John Coltrane to pop culture 
icons like Shaft and Mr. T, plus 
experiences from Hayes own life 
and family. Though broad, its a 
range that should be expected of 
Hayes, who claims that the only 
rule he abides by in his poetry is 
that he must keep surprising 
himself. .
Hayes first surprise relating to 
poetry was that he was, in fact, a 
poet. Always considering himself a 
painter, Hayes, 28, said that he 
didnt decide that he was a poet 
until the book came out last year. 
Despite this relatively recent deci
sion, Muscular Music was highly 
acclaimed by critics, receiving the 
1999 Whiting Writers Award and 
the 2000 Kate Tufts Discovery 
Award. According to creative writ
ing professor Jim Daniels, this is 
the first time that these two presti
gious awards have been won by 
the same writer in the same year. 
Hayes, who wrote the manuscript 
as part of the MFA program at the 
University of Pittsburgh, says that
whole year Ill ever get to wear it. 
Those who came in skirts and 
shirts clearly represented the 
majority. One could catch the 
occasional suspicious glances from 
the well dressed to the casually 
dressed attendants. In fact, even 
the formally dressed looked cock
eyed at the formally dressed. 
Seeing everyone dressed up was 
very bizarre. I felt weird walking 
out of my dorm in a suit, contin
ued Tolle.
Alison Cupp, a recruiter from 
Scient Corporation, didnt expect 
this kind of elegant attire among 
students. Some kids are coming 
home from class and dont have 
time to change. Others planned 
their outfits.
Students believe that recruiters 
dont always care if students are 
wearing suits. I think recruiters 
dont care if youre wearing a suit 
to a career fair or not. They do care 
if youre wearing one to an inter
view, but not to a career fair, con
tinued Cupp.

Senioritis descends on Class of 2001
Less Stress?
By: Emily Landes
> Have you ever wondered What 
am I going to do with my life? Ever 
started complaining about all the 
work you have to do, until you 
remembered how much better that
 work is compared to actual work 
youll soon being doing at a real 
job? Ever pestered your friends for 
hours on end by asking, So, are we 
really going to see each other after
 graduation? I mean, really, are we? 
We totally have to, man. Totally!
If you answered yes to these 
/questions, well then Im sorry, but 
you have developed a severe case of 
senioritis. If not, watch out, its 
highly contagious. All it takes is for 
one person to start off a sentence 
with, Remember back during 
freshman year... and thats it, a 
whole new room of victims.
, Thats just one mode of infection, 
-however, as you never really know 
when the virus will strike. In my 
case, for example, I went into a 
freshman level English class a calm 
and. satisfied person, but by the 
time I came out, I had been stricken 
with the dire disease. Heres what 
went down: I work for Academic 
Development and I had gone to the 
class to tell the first-years about our 
programs. During my spiel I made 
some little joke about how its hard
er to manage your time in college 
. because instead of your parents 
telling you to do your work, your
friends are telling you to go to PHI. 
Two kids laughed. The rest stared 
at me blankly. And thats when I 
realized: They had never heard of 
PHI. I left that class in a complete 
daze, thinking, Wow, remember 
when I had never heard of PHI? 
And just like that, I was infected.
Just as not everyone is infected 
with senioritis in the same way, the 
symptoms of the virus can manifest 
themselves differently in each vic
tim as well. Theres the my-god-Imso-old strain, the times-will-neverbe-this-good-again strain, the 
what-am-I-doing-with-my-life 
strain, or even the infamous Ivegot-to-party-like-a-rock-starbefore-its-too-late strain. Then 
theres the quadruple-whammy: 
The my-god-Im-so-old-and-timeswill-never-be-this-good-again-andI-dont-know-what-Im-doing-withmy-life-so-I-may-as-well-partylike-a-rock-star strain..
Ah, the quadruple whammy. I 
know it well, as it appears to be my 
senioritis of choice. But, almost 
everyone that I know has been 
contaminated by some form or 
another.
Is it any wonder that so many of 
us are looking at graduate school? I 
was in a program this summer 
wherein we had a number of panel 
discussions with professionals in 
journalism. In every single one, this 
one girl raised her hand and asked, 
How helpful is graduate school? 
In every single one, they told her 
honestly, Not at all. And despite
this answer, she continued to ask 
and continued to ask, until one per
son said, Well, I guess it couldnt 
hurt. She was thrilled, obviously, 
because graduate school, in addi
tion to its many other benefits, is a 
highly effective way of delaying the 
inevitable. You get to ignore the 
real world, stay in an academic 
utopia and, depending on your 
field, you might even get paid for it!
But not everyone moves on to 
graduate school. I, for one, am tak
ing all those panelists advice and 
trying my luck in the job market. 
Ive become obsessed, in fact, with 
visiting employment websites on a 
daily, even hourly, basis. Ive 
noticed that it is only when looking 
at a great job that my senioritis 
symptoms somewhat dissipate. 
But, I wonder, is it just a quick fix? 
Am I just leaving my worn immune 
system open to the nefarious, lategestational, Sure-this-job-seemsgreat-now, but-do-I-really-want-todo-this-for-the-rest-of-my-life? 
strain of the virus? Well, probably. 
But, you never know, Ive just got
ten word of a new Im-ready-tomove-on-to-the-next-stage-in-mylife vaccine. Ive heard that just a 
small dose stops the disease dead in 
its tracks. So, if you know how I can 
score some, please, let me know.
Emily Landes has reached her 
senioritis saturation point. If you try 
and infect her with another strain, 
she will have no choice but to hit you 
on the head with a shoe.

ATTIRE, from B1 
.H their attire, Cupp said I thought 
..people who wore what they normally wear to class seemed more 
relaxed. Sarnat said [when Im 
dressed professionally], Im defi
nitely putting on a front. Daniel 
thinks people dress up because 
the mindset is to play it safe.
So who is playing it safe and 
:>who is cutting off their nose to 
-.spite their suit? Like Sarnat
 claims, companies dont care at all. 
VIts possible that those who dress 
. down even make a more lasting 
impression. Cupp said the best
accessory she saw. during the 
whole day was a straw cowboy 
hat. It was refreshing! He had 
funky, dark, trendy pants on. It 
was something more than just 
casual. Maybe both the formal 
and casual dressers are missing 
the point.
Besides, there are three times 
you wear a suit: the career fair, the 
on-campus interview, and at the 
on-site interview, noted Daniel. 
He thinks its hardly worth the 
effort for such a small benefit. I 
want a student to show up in what 
they think is best... cultures in

(U-WIRE) CARBONDALE, 111.  
For three years, the Southern 
Illinois Achievers have been deter
mined to open a museum that 
embraces African-American cul
ture and history.
Corene McDaniel, president of 
the non-profit organization
formed in 1998, is confident she 
will establish the AfricanAmerican Museum of Southern 
Illinois after a little more hard 
work and fundraising.
I know we will do this and 
hopefully very soon, said 
McDaniel, former president of the 
Carbondale Chapter of the NAACP.
The 15-member group, which 
consists of Carbondale residents 
and Southern Illinois University 
(SIU) faculty, began working 
toward its goal after recognizing 
various deeds of community lead
ers, McDaniel said. We started 
! thinking that we need to do some| thing for those people that have
I made contributions, she said.
| We need to show our heritage
j and the contributions by other
I African-Americans that have been
j left out of the history books.
The group has allocated funds 
! for the museum through its
| monthly Soul Food Dinners at the
| Attucks Community Center,
while looking for possible sites 
throughout Carbondale. The 
organization aims to obtain suffi
cient funds before deciding on a
certain location.
If one of the places that were 
looking at came available tomor
row, we have to be in a position to 
say we want this, McDaniel said.
The group will conduct a dinner 
dance called Eve of Elegance at 7 
Friday night at the Carbondale 
Civic Center to raise funds for the 
museum. The event will include a 
silent auction, with internationally 
recognized artist Margaret 
Burroughs as the keynote speaker.
Burroughs founded the DuSable 
Museum of African-American 
History and Art in Chicago, one of 
the nations premier museums, 
inside of her home.
Shes a role model for us 
because she lets us know we can 
do it also, McDaniel said. She is 
very supportive of our program 
and were really glad that she was 
able to come for us.
McDaniel said communities 
throughout Southern Illinois 
should have a place to go to learn 
about African-American culture all 
year long. The closest black muse
ums are located in St. Louis, MO 
and Chattanooga, Tenn.
Black history in February is not 
enough to let the community, my 
children and grandchildren know 
about the contributions made by 
African-Americans, she said.
The museum will feature 
biographies, art exhibits and pho
tos of well-known blacks in the
Southern Illinois area. Willie 
Archie Jones, Carbondales first 
black city councilman, and Dick 
Gregory, a civil rights activist, 
comedian, and SIU Hall of Fame 
track star, will be among those to 
be recognized.
Tony Williams, a senior in politi
cal science from Chicago, argued 
that the museum should have 
been built many years ago because 
of the famous black SIU alumni 
and community members.
This school has been here for
ever and theres nothing here 
thats afro-centric, although there 
are a lot of African-American stu. dents, Williams said. I think itis 
a great idea to bring it down here 
so that the people of Southern 
Illinois can have some type of 
diversity.
John Holmes, a member of 
Southern Illinois. Achievers, said 
the museum will teach black histo
ry and help erase the stereotypical 
images of blacks as athletes and 
entertainers.
They need to know the people 
who marched for civil rights in the 
1960s or those involved in a boy
cott of a local store, insisting that it 
hire black people, said Holmes, 
an instructor for Black American 
Studies at SIUC. Its important for 
young people to know there are 
successful blacks who are not 
Michael Jordans or Oprah 
Winfreys.
companies are getting less con
cerned with dress.
Sarnat said his roommate, Adam 
Szymanski, also a junior in com
puter science, actually captured 
the attention of the Best Buy 
recruiter, who affectionately 
referred to him as the guy with
out the tie.
Next year, when the TOC circus 
comes to town, CMU students may 
still be pulling their clothes out of 
plastic dry cleaners bags, but 
recruiters probably still wouldnt 
care if their clothes came out of 
laundry bags instead.

THE TARTAN  SEPTEMBER 25, 2000
Professor Oded Meyer discusses Israel, Pittsburgh, all locations in between
by Asha Pathak
Business Manager
Dr. Oded Meyer, professor of statistics, is infamous among his former stu
dents. He is appreciated for his composure in lecture, his ability not only to 
teach, but to perform, and his personability outside of the classroom. Dr. 
Meyer teaches introductory statistics to first and second year students in 36- 
201 and 36-202, in addition to teaching the upper-level 36-225 course.
The Tartan: What brought you to Carnegie Mellon University?
Oded Meyer: Im originally from Israel. I came to the University of 
Pittsburgh to do a PhD in statistics, and I was looking for a position that 
emphasized teaching. I heard they were looking for an instructor in the 
Department of Statistics at CMU, and I interviewed and got the position. I 
was very happy to stay in Pittsburgh because I like it. Its my home.
TT: What made you decide to go into teaching?
OM: My 12th grade teacher. I looked at her, and she was such a great 
teacher, and I said to myself, Thats what I want to be. I want to do what 
shes doing, because shes having so much fun, and shes so good at it. She 
inspired me. She was my 12th grade English teacher in Israel.
TT: What do you like about statistics?
OM: Teaching it. I knew that I wanted to be a teacher. At first I thought 
I would be a music teacher, and then I thought I-would be a math teacher, 
but then I got into statistics, and I thought that would be a wonderful, won
derful subject to teach, because it involves math and a lot of common sense.
TT: Tell us about the statistical research youre currently involved with.
OM: Im involved in a project with Marsha Lovett from cognitive psy
chology, who is an assistant professor in the psychology department. We 
are working on developing this tutor for students in 36-201 to help them 
learn statistics. This tutor will help students in analyzing data. It will 
replace, at some point, at least some of the labs of 201 and 202. Thats been 
very interesting.
TT: What are your favorite kinds of students that you have encountered 
at CMU?
OM: I like students that come to office hours and I get to know them. 
Basically, its very hard in the big courses to get to know students, because 
you have 130 or 240 students. I get to know those that say Hi in the cor
ridor, and start talking to me, and I know that some students may feel 
intimidated or uncomfortable at first, but, actually, those are the students 
I like, those that do start talking to me.
Actually, I was working this week until midnight or later, and I went to 
my car at about quarter to 1 am, and a student approached me and said, 
Oh, Professor Meyer, can I ask you a question? And I thought it was won
derful, that he felt comfortable doing that.
TT: Did he ask you a question about statistics?
OM: About homework, yeah.
TT: Were you flattered that he was up late at night studying statistics?
OM: I was flattered that he felt comfortable asking me the question.
TT: Out by your car, late at night?
OM: Yeah. It told me that I must be doing something right, something 
about the way I teach that is right that people feel comfortable approach
ing me.
TT: You referred to students sometimes being intimidated by their pro
fessors. Do you think you intimidate your students?
OM: From the mid-semester evaluations there are always one or two stu
dents that say that I do intimidate them. The truth is, I dont really under
stand that. I dont think Im intimidating at all. I think that students have 
their own fears of statistics and of math, and they project it on me. Because 
I am Mr. Statistics for them, and I am intimidating to them because of what 
I teach. I try to be very personable and to let students feel that were in this 
together. Theyre here to learn and Im here to let them, to teach them, and 
to help them succeed.
TT: What is the best thing about being here, either at Carnegie Mellon or
Asha Pathak/Business Manager
Oded Meyer teaches two classes of introductory statistics in addition to the 
research he does developing tutors to assist students with data analysis.
in Pittsburgh?
OM: I love Pittsburgh. Its my home. Ive met people here that became 
the best friends Ive ever had in my life. Thats very important to me, friend
ship. About Carnegie Mellon, I like this department a lot. Its a wonderful 
and challenging environment to work in. I think Ive grown as a teacher in 
the last year that Ive been here a lot. I was teaching at Pitt beforehand. It 
was a totally different experience. And since I came here Ive learned a lot. 
Ive changed my teaching style, Ive added a computer component that I 
never had before.
TT: You studied in Israel before you came to the United States. What dis
parities between the two educational systems are worth noting?
OM: There are a lot of differences. First of all, the students. When they 
go to university in Israel they are at least 22 years old. People go to the 
army in Israel after high school. So, theyre more mature.
Here, theres a lot of emphasis on homework, and you monitor the stu
dents a lot during the semester. Theres homework, which is great, and labs 
and midterms, and then finals. There are a lot of components, and students 
are being evaluated constantly. In Israel its not that way, at least in statis
tics. Homework is given but not really graded, midterms sometimes are and 
sometimes arent. Basically, the final is most of your grade, and thats it. 
And you trust the students. They are mature enough to do their work, and 
thats it. Theres no evaluation during the semester.
In Israel, as a teacher, you have to be tougher, because the students are 
older, and they think theyre smart, and if youre not tough theyll climb all 
over you. When I first came to the United States and I was TAing at Pitt, I 
maintained this tough kind of teacher mode that I had in Israel, and the
evaluations I got said, Oh my God, this is the scariest teacher weve ever 
had! I did, I was tough, I thought it was like Israel. It took me a semester 
to figure out that its different. Students here are different  much more 
respectful. Its totally different.
TT: Whats number one on your list of things to do if you had the time?
OM: Travel. There are a lot of places in the United States that I havent 
been to yet. I hear Seattles nice. I want to travel to the West Coast more.
In the world, Im fascinated by Iceland. Dont ask me why, but for some 
reason I am. I want to see who lives there, what kind of people live there 
... what do they do? Do they sit outside in coffeehouses? It just fascinates 
me. And I like also the landscape of ice and water.
TT: What are you involved with outside of Carnegie Mellon? As Oded, 
rather than Professor Meyer?
OM: Im involved with the Pittsburgh Jewish-Israeli Film Festival. Im 
going to be the vice-chair of the festival this year. Last year I was in the 
movie selection committee. It was a wonderful experience, and I met a lot 
of wonderful people there. I got so enthusiastic about it that they nominat
ed me for the vice-chair position.
TT: Where do you get your jewelry?
OM: Where do I get my jewelry? What jewelry?
TT: The watch, the necklace you wear. Students have noticed them.
OM: The watch is from Amsterdam. Friends brought it to me. And the 
necklace ... the necklace itself I got from a friend during the army, and I got 
it for a birthday many years ago. That was when I was 20 or 21. The charm 
I got in Washington, DC.
TT: Do the casinos know how smart you are?
OM: Ive never been in a casino in my life.
TT: Why not?
OM: Im not really interested.
TT: You dont think it would be appealing as a statistician?
OM: No, Im not really into that. I prefer to spend my money elsewhere. 
I like to shop. I like to buy clothes.
TT: So if you did have to go to a casino, whats the best game, the one 
most worth your time?
OM: I dont even know the games at the casinos.
TT: Do you play cards?
OM: I play cards.
TT: Favorite card game?
OM: My favorite game is mini-bridge. Thats what they call it in Israel. 
Its kind of like bridge, but you dont play with a partner. You play by your
self. Its a smart game. Of course, it involves some component of luck, 
depending on which cards you get, but from that point on its really strate
gy and brains.
TT: Do you like the game because you know you can win?
OM: I like this game because its not pure luck. Its a lot of thinking.
TT: Which course do you like better, 36-201 or 202?
OM: Ahh! They are two different courses. Its very hard to say. The 202 
students have already had 201, so they come with some prior feelings 
about statistics, and Im number 2, so theyve seen statistics with someone 
else already. Its a little harder, because maybe they didnt like 201, so they

THE TARTAN  SEPTEMBER 25. 2000
Teaching is performance for Meyer
I MEYER, from page B3
| come to 202 and I have to persuade them that statistics 
I is fabulous. With 201, they are fresh, and its my job to 
I show them that statistics is fascinating and they need it 
I in everyday life. In that sense its different. There are 
1 some topics in 202 that I like to teach, like probability, 
I that I dont teach in 201, or the more advanced data 
I analysis. Each course has its own things that I like.
What I like a lot is that most of my TAs are people 
I who were my students, and its flattering that people 
3 want to work with me. Its a lot of fun when we have TA 
] meetings and people come and there are old people 
I who were my students  I enjoy this.
TT: When you walk into a lecture, and you see this 
I mass of students in front of you, what is it that you do 
I to perform and make things easier for everyone? What 
I is your mindset?
OM: I want the students to enjoy. I want them to 
I understand, to really be engaged in what I do. And.I do 
perform, I really do. I see it as a performance.
Its interesting because before I got into statistics I 
1 was a pianist. My first bachelors degree is in music, in 
I performing arts, in piano. I studied in the music acadeI my in Jerusalem. But I quit, because I couldnt handle 
I the performing, to play the piano in front of people I 
I dont know, because I felt very exposed, I really got into 
I it, I felt almost naked in front of all of these people. So 
I I quit. And thats one of the things my mother will never 
I forgive me for. No, just kidding. But it was very hard for 
B her to give up the dream of a son who was a concert 
I pianist.
But when I go into a classroom, I dont have any prob
lems. It could be 10 students, 50 students, or 200 hun
dred students. I just go in there and start performing. 
There is a difference for me.
TT: Whats it like to be a left-handed statistician?
OM: How did you notice that I was left-handed?
TT: How could your students not notice? All you do 
is write in lecture.
OM: Thats all I do?
TT: You tend to write a lot in lecture. Another thing 
that students notice is how neat your lecture writing is. 
Its very neat, very easy to follow.
OM: Left-handed. All of my family is left-handed. 
Actually, just my father and my brother. My mother 
isnt.
TT: Youre known for being one of the better-dressing 
statistics professors on campus.
OM: Im flattered that you say that. I do pay attention 
to that.
TT: Its not an accident?
OM: It takes me a while to get ready every morning.
TT: Are you vain?
OM: What? I dont know what is vain.
TT: Are you modest?
OM: Yes, I think I am. I think modesty and humility 
are the two most important qualities in a person. They 
come first. And then sense of humor and brains.CM U for h I re: This years on-campus recruiting efforts kicked into gear last week with the TOC and B0C.
Carnegie Almanac
50 YEARS AGO, September 27, 1950  The first classes were held 
 in the million dollar addition to Engineering Hall. The new part of the
| building was to be a new home for the chemistry and chemical engiJi neering departments. It included four classrooms, several offices, and
% laboratories for undergraduate and graduates.
In addition, Morewood Gardens had recently received extensive reno
vations. These changes have allowed all of Carnegies women to be 
: housed in one location. The new extension contained two floors. The
1 first floor contained a large and small dining room, a cafeteria counter,
and a kitchen. The second floor contained lounge rooms, a library room, 
a Dorm Council meeting room, reception desk, cloakroom, post office, 
powder room, mens room, and record room. The new wing also con, tained nine lounge areas and dining spaces for five hundred.
25 YEARS AGO, September 23, 1975  Bill Jacobs, president of 
Student Dorm Council (SDC), chaired the first meeting of the year, with 
most of its 24 newly elected representatives in attendance. The organi1 zation heard reports from administrators, including Sue Christian, coor; dinator of Campus Programming, and Dean Williams of Housing.
Christian was announced that the human sexuality lecture series would 
continue for 10 weeks. Williams encouraged students to lock their 
doors, in light of a recent robbery. He also spoke of recent vandalism to
public areas of dorms and reminded students that they would be 
charged for these actions.
Jacobs spoke of his goals for SDC, which included investigating the 
policy of charging students equally for vandalism, the possibility of serv
ing seconds in the Skibo Kiltie cafeteria, and how Housing could address 
problems with overcrowding.
TEN YEARS AGO, September 24,1990  A 40 year-old student was 
arrested during his ethics class for defiant trespass. The magistrates 
office notified campus police that they had a warrant for the students 
arrest and that it was very important that the student be arrested as 
soon as possible. The complaint was filed by Presbyterian Hospital and 
charged the student with threatening the hospitals president and secu
rity personnel. The student was ordered not to return to the hospital 
after he allegedly assaulted a nurse. When responding to the charges, 
the student made reference to the damage an M-16 assault rifle could 
do. According to students in the class, the officers showed up in plain 
clothes and asked to speak to the teacher. The teacher then returned to 
class and asked to speak to the student, who was later taken away in 
handcuffs.
FIVE YEARS AGO, September 25, 1995  Rumors circulated on
campus that a new alcohol policy would allow EMS to issue citations to 
students for alcohol-related offenses. Tim Foster, director of Resident 
Life, said that these rumors were false and unfounded. He said that the 
alcohol policy stayed primarily the same, but worked to encourage stu
dents to contact EMS when they or a friend has had too much to drink.
James LaPaglia, chief of Campus Police, told first-year students dur
ing Orientation that he would not issue citations to students who need
ed medical attention for alcohol consumption. He also said that when a 
student is written up for underage drinking or public intoxication, he or 
she is referred to Student Life and Student Affairs for a follow-up session 
to determine whether alcohol is a problem in the students life.
ONE YEAR AGO, September 27, 2000  A group of about 30 to 40 
CMU students formed the Taiwan Relief Fund in reaction to a deadly 
earthquake in Taiwan that killed more than 2,000 individuals and 
injured many more. The group, which was comprised of students from 
the campus community including leaders from the Awareness of Roots 
of Chinese Culture (ARCC), Taiwanese Student Association (TSA), and 
Tzu-Chi, seeked to raise awareness on campus of the problem and raise 
funds to help with the disaster recovery.

Companies look for various skills
by Sriram Vaidhyanathan
Junior Staffwriter
The 21st annual 
Technical Opportunities 
Conference was held this 
past Thursday in the 
University Center.
Companies filled stalls in 
the Wiegand Gymnasium, 
Rangos Ballroom, and the 
Peter, McKenna and 
Wright Rooms on the sec
ond floor. Ranging from 
industry heavyweights 
like Microsoft, IBM, and 
Sun Microsystems to fastgrowing newcomers like 
Network Appliance and 
Google, the companies 
tried their hand at attract
ing the best talent the 
University has to offer in 
the fields of engineering, 
professional and technical 
writing, computer sci
ence, chemistry, and 
many more for both 
internships as well as full
time jobs for graduating 
seniors.
Clad in impressive-lookirig suits and ties, students 
went from stall to stall 
passing around copies of 
their resumes to compa
nies interested in recruit
ment. Carnegie Mellon 
alumni from recent years 
were among the staff of 
several such corporations, 
some even from the class 
of 2000. But what exactly
were some of these com
panies looking for in these 
students?
Were looking at two 
things for the future: opti
cal... wireless... optical... 
wireless... optical... wire
less ... that's definitely 
where were going, said a 
representative from 
Lucent Technologies.
Different companies 
wanted different skills 
and qualifications. While 
some claimed that they 
looked for a minimum 
QPA, some stated that 
they would be quite satis
fied to see a certain level 
of requisite coursework 
completed by the next 
spring, in addition to an 
active interest in a particu
lar field. Research, active 
participation in ones field 
and previous work experi
ence were definite bonus
es at some companies. 
One could definitely 
notice a couple of compa
nies trying to shift the 
impetus of Sci-Tech-ness 
away from Silicon Valley, 
with internships and jobs 
being offered at locations 
in Maryland, Washington, 
Massachusetts, and Texas.
We have sites all over 
the country: including 
Phoenix, Arizona, Austin, 
Texas, and Portland, 
Oregon, said Dan Peters, 
CMU alum and an Intel

Apart from being infor
mative, representatives at 
most stalls realized the 
significance of the event 
to most students and were 
well versed in recruiting 
policies and procedures. 
Companies acknowledged 
the need for highly skilled 
technical experts in the 
workforce today, and one 
felt that the general 
atmosphere of the job fair 
reflected this need.
Companies also used 
freebies to attract stuChris Messina/Online Design Editor

dents to their booths. 
More popular ones includ

translucent spheres that 
gave off a light and sound 
every time they bounced.
Around 180 companies 
attended this years job 
fair, with over 140 looking 
for ECE majors, and over 
150 for computer science 
majors. Some new com
panies also decided to 
enter the TOC this year. 
Some include the online 
virtual dressing room

search enginegoogZe.com.
Wireless computing offers new services
WIRELESS, from page A1 
By purchasing the right wireless 
network card from the CMU 
Computer Store, students, faculty 
and staff can benefit from wireless 
computing in all administrative and 
academic buildings on the university 
campus. Since its start as a research 
network in 1994 to support CMLTs 
wireless research initiative, Wireless 
Andrew has expanded to cover over 
three million square feet of interior 
space, and in addition expanded out
door coverage around buildings, the 
football field, and Flagstaff Hill.
According to Charles R. Bartel, 
director of operations for Computing 
Services, Wireless Andrew has been 
very successful. Over 400 wireless 
network cards were sold during new 
student orientation and the first 
month of classes, and work is current
ly in progress to expand wireless cov
erage even further to the South Craig 
Street offices, off-campus university 
buildings, and off-campus apart
ments. Furthermore, CMU is also 
exploring the possibility of expanding 
the network into the homes of stu
dents, faculty and staff. Our efforts 
right now are aimed at testing the 
various home wireless products and 
identifying whether there are viable 
ways to ease the configuration issues 
and support of home wireless base 
stations., said Tracy Futhey, vice 
provost of Computing Services/ 
Computing Services is also working 
on its development of virtual clus
ters around campus. A pilot program 
first implemented last spring for the
undergraduate Business Department, 
virtual clusters are collections of lap
top computers that can be checked 
out by students for classroom use or 
general computing purposes. They 
operate on Wireless Andrew and fea
ture standard cluster software, such 
as Mulberry and Netscape Navigator. 
With these virtual clusters, students 
can easily check email and web 
browse while theyre on the run, or 
borrow one for classes that require 
laptops. Currendy, there are six busi
ness classes taking advantage of the 
virtual clusters, including 
Organizational Behavior and 
Financial & Security Trading (FAST).
CMU was able to open its first vir
tual cluster in the GSIA building last 
spring through a special allocation 
from the Provost. The cluster current
ly provides 50 Windows 2000 PCs 
and features Windows-based soft
ware needed for BA courses, in addi
tion to standard cluster software such 
as email applications. Due to its 
apparent success, CMU opened a new 
virtual cluster this fall in the 
University Center that features 10 
Macintosh iBooks donated from 
Apple Computer.
In order to use virtual clusters, 
students must first fill out an appli
cation form agreeing to the list of 
terms, rules and regulations. After 
their application is processed, stu
dents receive cards that allow them 
to check out laptops anytime 
between 8 am and 10 pm. Students 
are not permitted to leave the build
ings while they have laptops
checked out in their possession, and 
are charged a fee of $25 if the com
puter is returned late. The GSIA lap
tops can be checked o'ut for a three 
hours at a time, while the UC iBooks 
must be returned after 45 minutes.
The virtual clusters have some prob
lems and glitches. It can take a while to 
download software, and heavy net
work traffic can slow down the net
work speed, or even kick users off 
completely. Users cannot print from 
the virtual clusters. Furthermore, lap
tops are not as easily available as com
puters in regular clusters. The 50 lap
tops in the GSIA are often reserved for 
class use, and all of the laptops often 
need to be recharged before they can 
be checked out.
However, Farhat [Meena] 
Lakhavani, Director of User Services 
at Computing Services, said she is 
very enthusiastic about the virtual 
clusters pilot program and believes 
the benefits far outweigh the costs.
No other schools have succeeded 
 in doing this, so its very exciting for 
CMU. Were still getting feedback, 
but the system is very innovative, 
has a lot of room for potential and 
works well in providing flexibility 
for the students, said Lakhavani.
By providing students with wireless 
systems to use and bring to class, said 
Lakhavani, the University doesnt 
need to buy as much expensive equip
ment to install power jacks and hard
ware for laptops in order to make 
classrooms better-equipped, nor does 
it need to worry as much about find
ing space to build additional clusters.
Information You Can Use
Maximizing the Application of Printing
Surya Singh
~~
Printing is one of the quintessential applications 
of personal computing, yet it receives the least 
amount of attention and tweaking. Clearly, the 
final value of a majority of PC documents is the 
final hardcopy that is generated.
There are variety of options and applications for 
desktop printers that are easy to access, yet are 
rarely utilized. These include being able to control 
the quality (and/or resolution) of the printout, the 
way it is printed, and when it is printed.
One of the most overlooked printer controls is the 
device settings window. By controlling the options 
listed, one can vary the speed, quality, and type of 
output. In addition, this window can be used to 
vary other printer parameters such as the media 
type and language features (e.g., PostScripts n-up 
printing option, which allows more than one page 
to be printed to an actual page).
Another useful feature is the ability to schedule 
and control printing tasks. This can be especially 
useful if the print item is very long and will take the 
printer some time to process. It can also be helpful 
if the printer is noisy and the print job needs to be 
postponed until the device will not disturb others 
or interfere with other tasks. The traditional 
method is to do this through the printer control of 
the OS (operating system) (see Figure 1). 
However, this is not ideal for numerous reasons. 
First, the job will reside as part of the OS, which 
may prevent the ability to transfer the job to anoth
er printer or computer. Second, NT scheduling is a

Figure 1: Traditional print scheduling windows
semi-privileged activity and, thus, general users 
can not schedule their own jobs. Finally, the print 
job maybe lost or corrupted if the OS fails.
The aforementioned concerns can be addressed 
by printing to a file and then forwarding this file-to 
the correct printer or system. In addition to giving 
more control, it is an essential step in the direct 
printing of files, which is important when using 
other peoples printers. The procedure for doing 
this on the Microsoft Windows platform (the proce
dure for other operating systems is quite similar) is 
outlined as follows:
1. Setting the default mode to print to file:
a. Goto Start Settings  Printers.
b. Select the printer you wish to control 
(e.g., HP LaserJet III).
c. Double click the printers icon to bring 
up the printer status window.
d. Select the Properties option.
e. Change the output port to File (under 
the Ports Tab in Windows NT.
2. Printing to file selectively.
a. Go to the application which contains the 
file or document that needs to be printed.
b. When ready to print open the program's 
print window (e.g., File -Print).
c. Make sure the appropriate printer is 
selected (i.e., its name appears in the Printer Name 
area) (See Figure 2). This is especially important 
because the type of printer (and its associated print 
driver) is responsible for the type of file created 
(e.g., PostScript, Printer Control Language (PCL), 
etc.).
d. Print the document.
e. Provide a convenient location for storing 
the output file.
The file created is basically a temporary repre
sentation of the document to be printed by the 
printer. However, this is not to imply that this file 
cannot be seen on the screen. Depending on the 
format, there are programs that will allow the file 
to be seen. For PostScript files consider using 
Ghostview (which uses the free GhostScript 
engine). For PCL files consider using SwiftView 
(Jhttp://www.ndg.com/dload/dlmain.htm). It is 
important to note that only one of these options is 
necessary. That is, if one has set up a driver to 
always print to file it is not necessary to repeat this 
in an applications print window.
Once the documents in a printer-ready format a 
full gamut of options are available to the user. One 
obvious option is to schedule print items and gain 
further control by confirming all print items sent to 
the printer. This is most easily done by redirecting 
the file to any applicable printer: In Windows, the 
file can be copied to a local port, with the copy /b 
file port where file is the file to be printed and port 
is the local printer port with an attached printer.n 
(e.g., lptl). For redirecting to non-local (as well as1 
local) printers consider using the freeware PrintFile : 
(http://hem.passagen.se/ptlerup/prfile.html) pro-, 
gram. In MacOS, simply copy the file to the printer 
(or an alias to it). In Linux/Unix, use the lpr com
mand to copy the file over.
If the output file is in PostScript form it can be 
readily converted to Portable Document Format 
(PDF) - a compressed, form of the PostScript lan
guage. This can be done using the ps2pdf command 
(available on Linux/Unix and/or through  the 
Andrew system) or by using the commercial 
Acrobat Distiller program. Also, the file parameters 
(e.g., n-up printing) can be changed via the redi
recting mechanism to meet the needs at hand.
However, the killer app for the redirection tech
nique is Printing to Other Peoples, Printers. 
Through this scheme a print job can be redirected 
virtually anywhere and printed at any time. This 
concept also affords greater user convenience by. 
facilitating the printing/forwrding of a print job tomost network printers even if the printer is not set 
up on the computer being used to create the con
tent (e.g., printing directly to a cluster printer from 
a computer at home) .
The creation-of hardcopy takes the PC from the 
virtual world to the real world. Some argue one of 
the primary uses of PC technology is the generation 
of processed information (intelligence) in a tangi
ble (often printed) hardcopy form.
The process for creating a file in a print-ready 
format was described in detail in the previous col
umn. However, it is summarized as follows:
1. Insure that a PostScript or HP PCL 5 Driver is 
installed. On a Windows PC, this is done by check
ing for the presence of a printer which prints to a 
PostScript (PS) device or a HP LaserJet III or high
er. On a Macintosh, this is done by going to the 
chooser and selecting a LaserWriter type printer.
2. Print the document as a Printer-Ready file
a. Process the document in an application 
as normal.
b. In the print window (see Figure 1) select 
the Print as File option. Macintosh users should 
change the destination from a printer to a file.
3. Save the file in a given location and with an 
appropriate extension PostScriptfiles are dramati
cally different from PCL files. As such, it is a good 
practice to have a .ps extension for PostScript files

Luminous Lambs
And another item of 
note ... sheep farmers 
in Ireland and Great 
Britain are experi
menting with a new 
way to protect their 
livestock from preda
tors - they are creating 
. lambs that glow in the 
dark! The farmers are 
spraying spring lambs 
with a green fluores| cent spray which 
charges up when
 exposed to daylight, 
then produces a flick
ering glow throughout 
Ithe night. The ghoul
ish glow is enough to Elizabeth Levin/Junior Art taff
make even a wily fox nervous.
As an added bonus, the paint tastes awful. Any fox trying to sink its 
teeth into a lambchop gets a mouthful of the pungent pigment.
The paint comes in designer shades of red, orange, green,'and blue, 
so you can color coordinate your sheep.
You might be wondering though, what effect all this will have on 
insomniacs ... who may find it even harder to get to sleep ... counting 
luminous sheep.

Handspring Visor Deluxe: Chris Messina
If youve realized that your life 
has somehow unraveled and that 
youre losing track of your home
work, your appointments, your 
classes and your mother, welcome 
to the world of the PDA. If youve 
already got a PDA, youre no doubt 
familiar with the world of the 
pager, the cell phone, the digital 
camera, and all those other fun but 
pricey e-toys. Add another one to 
that list: the new Handspring Visor.
The Visor is basically a Palm Pilot 
with a twist. At the heart of the 
Handspring devices is the Palm OS, 
by design, written to help busy peo
ple stay organized. Its the propri
etary Springboard expansion bus 
that increases the extensibility and 
the life of the traditional Palm Pilot. 
The actual device is not much dif
ferent than previous Palm III 
designs, using the same four 
Quicklink buttons and the two 
scrolling buttons on the face. The 
touchscreen has not significantly 
changed from the Palm screen 
either, with two application-based 
icons sitting on either side of the 
Graffiti pad. This was done to make 
the transition from the Palm Pilots 
to the Visor smooth and practically 
unnoticed for long-time users look
ing for more flexibility from their 
PDA. Users can count on the same 
Palm interface as well as the same 
Graffiti handwriting theyve adapt
ed to (especially coming from the 
Mac or Windows OS).
Deluxe Software & Cross 
Platform Compatibility
The Handspring Visor Deluxe 
comes bundled with basic software 
like Address Book, To Do List, 
Memo Pad, Find, and Expense. The 
Visor Deluxe also adds advanced 
versions of the Date Book and 
World Clock. While these programs 
are much simpler than their WinCE 
counterparts (such as Outlook), the 
pre-bundled software is robust and 
highly user-friendly. The Palm 
Desktop syncing software is very 
helpful in keeping your home and 
office computers consistent while 
of course adding portability to the 
same data. The installation process 
is incredibly easy and takes literally 
only a matter of minutes. The actu
al desktop software is a bit cumberThe Handspring Visor Deluxe

some at first, and it seems as 
though Palm merely ported the 
handheld program to the desktop 
without adding much in the trans
lation. There is an option, however, 
to import calendar and contact data 
from the major desktop PIMs.
The Visor Deluxe comes bundled 
with a USB cradle rather than the 
much slower (1.5Mbps versus 115 
Kbps) Palm serial cradle. While the 
serial cradle is available at addi
tional cost, most users will appreci
ate the improved performance of 
the USB cradle. USB is also native 
to both Win98/NT/2000 and the 
new versions of Mac OS, making it 
much easier to set up the Visor to 
work with your PC at home and 
your Mac at work (or vice versa). 
The Hot Sync feature is fast and it is 
easy to add and remove compo
nents found on the Internet.
New Styling and Pricing 
Gives Visor Advantage
One of the nice design options 
offered with the Visor Deluxe is the 
ability to choose from five different 
colors including orange, blue, 
graphite, ice, and green; and while 
the iMac-inspired translucent case 
might not be as cool five years from 
now, the Visors overall distinctive 
appearance ensures that it wont go 
out of style any time soon. The one 
major drawback to the Visors design 
is the removable plastic faceplate.
Chris Messina/Online Design Editor
While it might be less likely to break 
off, it is more likely to be lost, and its 
a pain to remove when your hands 
are full. Other than that, the restyled 
icons add to the fun visual identity of 
the Visor as compared to the Palm 
Pilots much more professional tone. 
The price tag also confirms the shift 
from the professional user to the upand-coming entrepreneur or the 
cash-strapped college student. The 
Visor Deluxe retails for around 
$250, substantially cheaper than the 
related Palm Vx that sells for around 
$400. The Visor Solo ships either as 
a stand-alone device with 2MB RAM 
and with ($179) or without ($149) 
the docking cradle. The Visor Deluxe 
comes with 8MB. RAM, a leather 
slipcase, and the USB cradle. The 
Deluxe also gives you the option of 
selecting one of the five colors from 
above; the Solo only comes in 
Graphite. If you can afford it, the 
Deluxes 8MB is significant enough 
to warrant the extra expense.
The Springboard: a Look at 
the Visors Extensibilty
The feature that separates the 
Visor from its nearest Palm or WinCE 
cousin is the proprietary Springboard 
external expansion slot. The reason 
Handspring decided to replace the 
customary Flash cards was to encour
age developers with an open stan
dard. Thus developers can create 
Springboard Modules without hav
ing to deal with suffocating licens
ing terms from Handspring.
So far there are plugin modules 
that act as MP3 players, pagers, 
video cameras, remote controls, 
hard-line modems, and special 
memory-intensive software that 
are too large to be stored in the 
Visors built-in memory. There are 
also wireless modem, cell phone 
and GPS modules in the works. 
Its likely that if the Springboard 
technology is widely adopted for 
its versatility and extensibility, it 
may become the next defacto 
open standard for extending 
PDAs. You can definitely expect 
that if Handspring can deliver on 
the many modules it claims are on 
the way, the Visor family of PDAs 
will survive much longer than its 
limited predecessors.
Final Word: Visor Deluxe 
Packs Style, Function and 
Utility at a Decent Price
The Handspring Visor Deluxe 
brings together many important 
features in a sleek and extensible 
package. While the less expen
sive Visor Solo might be suffi
cient for light uses such as note 
taking and to-do lists, the Visor 
Deluxes extra memory is a 
necessity for more demanding 
uses. The syncing cradle also 
makes responding to email on 
the go easy, as well as keeping 
track of appointments and con
tact info. Desktop users will find 
that the interface takes some get
ting used to but is still more reli
able and efficient than Win CE. 
The lack of a color display (found 
in most Win CE devices) may dis
appoint some users but the 
extended battery life and impres
sive backlight make up for its 
absence.
The Visor Deluxe is useful and 
the Springboard adds to its 
longevity. While the Visor may be 
limited in some ways because of 
the Palm OS, it is nevertheless a

and .pci extension for PCL files.
The next general step is to 
transfer the file to the printer. 
While numerous techniques exist 
for doing this two popular ones 
are to go through a Unix server or 
to go direcdy to the networked 
printer (e.g., the hypothetical 
SCS printer sui).
Unix Server Solution:
1. Move the file to a Unix 
machine that has the printer set 
up. Using any KFTP or AFS 
client, login to your Andrew 
account and move the file(s) to 
one of the main Unix machines
small BSD LPD servers/dae
mons. If the network name of 
the printer is known (often its 
IP name), it is possible to print 
directly to the printer. 
However, many printers have 
access locked to a specific serv
er. If this is the case, direct 
printing to the printer may not 
be successful.
1. Find the printers network 
name and/or the primary serv
er serving it. This can often be 
obtained by looking at the 
setup for a computer that has 
the printer installed (in NT, 
look at the port which the 
printer is attached to, in Unix

(e.g., sun4). Be sure that the 
I<FTP client is operating in bina
ry mode and that there is 
enough disk space in your per
sonal area (this can be done via 
the/s quota command in Unix). 
If there is not enough space in 
your personal area consider 
moving it to the /tmp directory.
2. Print the file.
 If the printer has been set up 
on the Unix machine, then type
Ip -d sui NameOfFile.ps
 To add printing options 
(such as duplex) type
Ip -d sui -o duplex 
NameOfFile.ps
9 On a computer with an LP 
client type
Ip -d cyan.srv.cs.cmu.edu:sui 
NameOfFile.ps
Direct to Printer Solution:
This solution takes advan
tage of the fact that most net
work printers are acting as
 ?|X|/etc/printcap 
file). Another 
technique is 
to query the 
printer, but 
this is often a 
function of 
the driver that 
was installed.
2. If 
not already 
done, be sure to 
install an LP 
client. In 
Windows NT, 
this is done by 
adding the 
TCP/IP Printing service through 
the Service tab of the Network 
Control Panel.
3. Install the printer so ; 
that it uses the LP client to send 
the job to the printer. Often 
the destination (i.e., the part 
after the colon) can be any 
string. However, for Apple 
printers it is often text and for 
HP printers it is often ps or 
pel.
4. Print the file. Depending on 
the OS/client, it may be as simple 
as printing the file or may require 
actually entering the command 
(e.g., Ip -d sui.prt.cs.cmu.edu:ps 
NameOfFile.ps).
In conclusion, one of the 
most common computing tasks 
has a number of features and 
options that can offer the user 
much more control and flexibil
ity in how, when, and where 
their hard work is turned into 
hard copy.

Scary sequel provides few 
horrors to bored viewers
FILM REVIEW
by Ryan Friedman
Junior Staffwriter
Do you like scary movies? The 
only thing scary about Urban 
Legends: Final Cut is the fact that it 
was released.
Urban Legends 2 is the sequel to 
the financially successful 1998 
movie Urban Legends, a film about 
a serial killer who murders his vic
tims in different ways according to 
various . suburban myths. The 
sequel does not build on the plot 
of its predecessor. Instead, Urban 
Legends: The Final Cut has its own 
separate cast of characters with an 
entirely different plot. However, 
both movies fall into the category 
of cheesy horror flicks that deal 
with, you guessed it, urban leg
ends.
The film stars Jennifer 
Morrison, Matthew Davis, Joseph 
Lawrence, Loretta Devine, and 
Anson Mount in a movie that tries 
to mimic the overused and trendy 
murder/mystery style of Wes 
Craven. Written by Scott 
Derrickson and Paul Harris 
Boardman, this monotonous 
sequel fails to keep audiences 
engaged in serious plot; instead, 
gpry murder scenes and pretty 
people take the place of anything 
cerebral.
The movie is about a group of 
students at Alpine University, the 
nations premier film school, who 
are all competing to win the pres
tigious Hitchcock Award. The win
ner gets $15,000 and a chance to 
shoot a film in Hollywood. In the 
past, the winners of the award 
have all landed high-paying 
directing jobs in Tinseltown and 
. the losers ended up as starving 
artists.
The story revolves around a girl 
named Amy (Jennifer Morrison), 
who is determined to win the 
award. However, she has to outdirect Toby (Anson Mount), whos 
shooting a disaster flick about a 
plane crash that is featured in the 
opening scene, Graham (Joseph 
Lawrence), the snobby son of a 
Hollywood tycoon, and the myste
riously secretive Travis (Matthew 
Davis).
For the contest, Amy 
decides to produce a hor
ror flick about urban leg
ends. Once production 
gets underway, members 
of her crew start to disap
pear. Amy suspects that 
they have been murdered, 
and sets off to discover the 
killer in fear that she may 
be his next victim.
The worst thing about 
this movie was the fact 
that it failed t keep my 
interest. Halfway through 
it I found myself wishing I 
were somewhere else.
(Even an Intro to World 
History lecture would have 
been sufficient!)
Horror flicks were once 
again cool after the origi
nal Scream was released in 
early 1997. Since then, we 
have been bombarded 
with productions such as 
Scream 2, Scream 3,1 Know 
What You Did Last 
Summer, I Still Know What 
You Did Last Summer, and 
now Urban Legends: Final 
Cut. In todays uncreative 
and unimaginative world 
people are being spoon-fed 
re-creations of mediocre 
movies with even less of a 
plot then their forerun
ners. After all, did the 
world really need a third 
Free Willy movie and a sev
enth Land Before Time?
We need something 
new, a different twist to an 
old genre. Horror films are 
fun to watch and the mys
teries associated with spotting the 
killer in the film are both enter
taining and challenging. Urban 
Legends: The Final Cut is the same 
dull plot we have seen over and 
over in the past few years. My 
advice: save the eight bucks and 
go see a better movie.
Critic finds Almost Famous 
to be an almost perfect film
by Lindsay Clark
Junior Staffwriter
When I heard that I was going to 
be reviewing Almost Famous, the 
new Cameron Crowe movie, I have 
to say that I was not expecting much.
artwork on page by Justin Suissa/Art Editor
FILM REVIEW
After all, this is the man who is 
responsible for Jerry Maguire, unde
niably an entertaining piece of fluff, 
but a piece of fluff no less. But Crowe 
has redeemed himself with a satiri
cal, engaging, and hilarious semiautobiographical story.
At first glance, Almost Famous is a 
coming-of-age piece. The 
main character, William 
Miller (Patrick Fugit), is a 
fifteen-year-old boy who 
gets the chance of a lifetime 
when Rolling Stone asks 
him to tour with an up and 
coming rock band called 
Stillwater. The movie has 
all the components of the 
typical coming-of-age 
piece: an innocent teenag
er, a mentor, a temptation 
from corrupt forces, an 
inner conflict between con
science and desire, and a 
beautiful love interest with 
problems that only the hero 
can help her solve.
But to relegate this movie 
to the ranks of other nostal
gic views of adolescence, 
like Footloose or Crowes 
own Fast Times at 
Ridgemont High, would be 
to ignore the many levels of 
meaning that are deftly 
woven together throughout 
the script. The movie is a 
snapshot of the late 60s 
and early 70s, a time which 
has often been caricatured 
in the many retrospectives 
it has inspired. It is an 
attempt at explaining what 
drives the fascination that 
American youth has with 
rock stars. Finally, it is an 
expos of the music indus
try, and the loss of integrity 
it suffered during the early 
seventies.
The most important 
theme in the movie is the 
issue of coolness. William
is the embodiment of uncool. 
Williams mother (Francis 
McDormand) is overbearing, has 
jumped him ahead many grades so 
that he doesnt even hit puberty 
until his senior year, and refuses to 
let her children listen to rock music. 
This makes him an embarassment to 
the music industry that he would 
like to cover, which his mentor, 
famous critic Lester Bangs (Philip 
Seymour Hoffman), dubs the 
industry of cool.
The truth of this phrase is driven 
home when the lead singer of 
Stillwater wraps up an interview by 
saying, Just make us look cool. 
Stillwater knows that they need to 
look cool to succeed in the industry; 
it is the publics obsession with cool, 
as manifested in rock stars, which 
sells records. William, in compari
son, is dubbed the Opie of the 
group.
William seems to buy into this 
industry of cool for a while, because 
as Lester points out, They made you 
drunk ... they make you feel cool 
And I met you. You are not cool. Biit 
in his awkwardness, William is cool, 
He is honesd cool unlike the rock 
stars he is interviewing, who merely 
project the image of cool. This is 
what leads him to follow Lesters 
advice; If you want to be real 
friends with them, be honest and b 
unmerciful.
And Crowe, the real life William, is 
honest in his treatment of this story, 
which paves the way for the movis 
success. The script, even with the 
absurdity of the premise, seems 
oddly believable. The lines are 
superbly quotable without being 
awkward. Some great performances 
by Hoffman, Billy Crudup (Russell, 
the lead guitarist), and the phenom
enal McDormand counterbalanc 
the clumsy performance of neophyte 
Fugit and the one-dimensional per
formance of Kate Hudson (who 
plays Penny Lane). Overall, this film 
is definitely one of the years best.

Reviewer revisits, enjoys first Coen Brother motion picture
by Andrew McKeon
Junior Staffwriter
In most cases, the clich, everybody gets 
their start somewhere, is used as justifica
tion for a poor first effort. Such is not the 
case with the Coen Brothers, Ethan and 
Joel.
Written into the genetic code of the Coen 
DNA is a knack for writing and directing 
great films. This was first made apparent in 
their breakout film, Blood Simple, a filmnoir picture that has since become venerat
ed as a high watermark in independent 
films.
Originally released in 1984 to critical 
acclaim, as it became a crossover success, 
Blood Simple has recendy been re-released 
in a directors cut with different music and 
other alterations. Impressive is the fact that 
the movie still holds up today, over 15 years 
after its initial release. Credit for this feat 
must go to the Coen Brothers and their 
unique style of directing and film produc
tion in general.
Although they co-write their films, the 
Coen Brothers divide their labor for the 
actual production of the film to avoid con
fusion during the rolling of the credits. Joel 
adopts the title of director while Ethan 
hblds the position of producer. On the set, 
however, the brothers would be better suit
ed with a directors chair built for two, for 
they share equally in the direction of the 
film.
Set in the Lone Star State and filmed in 
and around Austin, the film cinematically
replicates all of Texass dusty majesty to a 
capital T. Just as the snow served as an 
actor in Fargo, the setting of Blood Simple 
helps convey the dark, detached mood of 
isolation and sin in the story.
Being of the film-noir persuasion, Blood 
Simple has less dialogue than most of the 
brothers films, so it has a slight tendency to 
lag at times, but compensates with stun
ning visuals and wonderfully smooth scene 
transitions. Close-ups, subtle visual 
imagery, and daring camera movement 
abound in this throwback to film-noir, 
thanks in part to director of photography 
and future big-name director Barry 
Sonnenfeld.
Accentuated by elements of mystery, 
dark comedy, and even horror, the picture 
has all the makings of a modern film-noir 
classic: rogue male protagonist, cunning 
miscreant villain, and dame caught in the 
crossfire/romantic lead. As for acting, the 
performances in Blood Simple leave nothing 
to desire. Most notable among the thespians are Frances McDormand and Michael 
Emmet Walsh for their intriguing portray
als of the justifiably unfaithful wife and 
kooky, but cunning, killer. Complementing 
the great acting, plot twists and precarious 
situations into which unknowing charac
ters are forced make this film compelling to 
the very last shot.
Not tremendously confusing or over
loaded with characters, the plot goes as fol
lows: A degenerate bar owner hires a 
greedy old lowlife to spy on his cheating 
wife. When his suspicions are confirmed, 
the bar owner orders the same old coot for
FILM REVIEW
a cowboy to kill his wife and her lover. As 
ironically implied in the title, there is 
bloodshed and things get complicated.
The Coen trademarks of marital troubles, 
hired killings, and unlikely heroes so preva
lent in their most recent films like Fargo 
and The Big Lebowski have their genesis in 
the brothers seminal work. Also estab
lished in Blood Simple is the brothers tradi
tion of offbeat characters and their humor
ous idiosyncrasies that give a touch of the 
absurd to their films. Most of the character
istic Coen humor is found in the smaller 
characters such as the bantering landlady, 
the garrulous woman on the message 
machine, and the monotonousstrip bar 
exhorter. However, aside from the delight
fully tacky wardrobes, occasional terse, 
witty comments, and the few ridiculous 
minor characters, there are not many comic 
elements in the film, as it is a more serious 
film relying on situational irony for amuse
ment.
Far from a mere rookie effort, Blood 
Simple serves as the first of many 
enthralling films by the Coen Brothers. The 
picture is solid and well written with capti
vating visuals, an enthralling plot, and 
incredible acting. Thus, it is easy to see why 
the Coen Brothers made a name for them
selves with Blood Simple. It is a good movie, 
plain and simple.
Blood Simple is available for rental on 
VHS only. The special showing sponsored by 
the Pittsburgh Filmmakers Association ran 
September 14- 17 at the Melwood Screening 
Room.

Das Boot: The Directors Cut
Thursday, September 28
So, you like U-571 and Crimson Tide? Well,this 1981 German 
classic directed by Wolfgang Petersen (Air Force One) looks at 
undersea World War II from the Deutsch perspective for a 
change. The title of the movie holds deeper meaning than one 
might expect, as it translates roughly into English as The Boat: 
The Filmmaker is Injured and then back into German as Der 
Glockenspiel: Ich bin Ein Berliner.
This is a pretty heavy movie. The crew goes into it knowing 
theyve got worse chances of making it than the old guy on 
Survivor who yelled at people about 25 hours a day for being 
lazy. It documents the claustrophobia and feeling of panic that 
can affect a group of men in close quarters (get those thoughts 
out of your head.) Reviews of it are almost uniformly glowing, 
except for the International Association of Innocent Bystander 
Whales, who called it shocking and offensive and the Alliance 
of Shy and Awkward People, who wouldnt come out of their 
room to comment.
At 7 pm and 11 pm

Gladiator
Friday, September 29
Lo and behold, I have actually seen one of the movies Im pre
viewing, namely Gladiator, this Russell Crowe-starring epic 
about a former Roman general named Maximus. If you only see 
one movie on campus this semester, please make this one your 
choice. After being cheated out of Romes highest office 
(Minister of Rigatoni), Maximus gets sold into slavery and must 
battle his way back to prominence as a top-notch fighter in pub
lic spectacles.
I was going to mention how Joaquin (pronounced 
Chewbacca) Phoenix does a great job as Maximus adversary 
Commodus, but I cant get that part in Airplane! out of my head 
where Peter Graves asks that little kid So, do you like movies 
about gladiators? In fact, now that I mention Airplane!, I cant 
really think about anything movie-related, only how unbeliev
ably funny Airplane! is. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar needs to get back 
into acting quick so we can stop the flood of cut-rate movies like 
Schindlers List and Saving Private Ryan that, sorry Mr. Spielberg, 
just arent tickling my funny bone.

The Patriot
Saturday, September 30
The secret to success in the movie biz is, without a doubt, a 
good, solid formula. The Patriot is a good example, as the simple 
equation Mel Gibson + evil, soon-to-be dead British people = 
Jackpot has been successful for Gibsons Oscar-winning epic 
Braveheart as well this well-received Revolutionary War film.
There are countless other equations that drive the film busi
ness; here are a few that were sent to me by a Hollywood so-andso who no doubt has more money than I can count without sev
eral calculators:
1. Naked women + Pretty much anything = Great 80s comedy.
2. Young actors + Nice cars - Plot = Every Freddie Prinze 
movie ever.
3. Leonardo DiCaprio + A great script + Top-notch directors 
and producers + a new, innovative filmmaking concept + 
Divine intervention = A movie that still has Leonardo DiCaprio 
in it.
4. Romance + Emotional depth + Deep character studies + A 
bittersweet ending = A nap for me.
5. Finally, the last equation of my list: Star Wars + Jar Jar Binks 
- Princess Leia in that outfit Jabba bought her to wear around his 
house + Amazing computer graphics - Amusing 70s haircuts = 
George Lucas owing me the approximately $7.50 I coughed up 
for Phantom Menace.

WarGames
Sunday; October 1
Capping off the unofficial Violent War Weekend here at CMU 
is WarGames, a movie that, if it falls in the forest and no one is 
around, doesnt make a sound. This 1983 picture, starring 
Matthew Broderick as a young geek who, apparently tired of 
Centipede, diverts his attention to breaking into NORADs 
(National Organization of Rappers and DJs) computer systems. 
Brodericks computer espionage fouls their database up so much, 
in fact, that white rappers become popular (hey, it could hap
pen}, fueling an intense war between the United States and any 
number of polka-cherishing nations. Well, thats the way I inter
pret it anyway. Something along those lines. You get my drift. 
Whats good for the goose is good for the gander.
The title of this movie gets me thinking about really good old 
war games, like Contra, Combat, Defender of the Crown, and 
Tecmo Bowl. Those were the days. By the way, what on Gods

stops achieving goals and breaking 
barriers. Graduating summa cum 
laude./from Harvard Law School is 
not enough. A bobos life is a neverending learning process; a bobo,
consequently, is a life-long gradu
ate student.
Hence, the rise of the bobo cul
ture depends upon the ever-increas-. 
ing role of social and political insti
tutions. Without these institutions, 
the bobo culture will tumble down. 
A potential problem facing the bobo 
culture, as a result, is that the form 
might become more important than 
the substance itself. Social and 
political institutions, such as 
Harvard Law School (HLS), are 
examples of a form in which bobos 
are created. But to what extent does 
HLS make an individual a bobo? 
Bobos in Paradise never explicitly 
answers this question, and perhaps 
even represses this topic. But one 
might argue that the author 
believes that in the bobo world the 
form and the substance cannot be 
separated from each other. The rise 
of the bobo culture is also a rise of 
the importance of the form; herein 
lies the difference between the 
1950s and todays intellectuals. The 
1950s intellectuals believed pas
sionately in ideas, arts, and philoso
phies, the substance. To become an 
intellectual in the 1950s was to 
write a literary masterpiece.
We have lost a certain epistemology and have gained another. Deep 
thoughts have been replaced by 
smart ideas. Gurus  Abby Joseph 
Cohen for example  have 
replaced philosophers, such as 
Simone Weil. In the bobo world, 
practicing Weils teachings is much 
ado about nothing. Brooks writes, 
I at least would not want to go 
back.... Is wisdom best attained by 
sitting in a book-stuffed studio on 
Riverside Drive, reading Freud and 
the existentialists, engaging in 
intense debates with an insular 
crowd, most of whom live within a 
few square miles? ... Or is it [wis
dom] gained through broader 
experience with the world, by 
putting one foot in the river of 
mainstream life and then by reflect
ing on what you found there? Its 
not only that modern writers have 
fatter wallets than the old kind. We 
[bobos] have different epistemologies.
Bobos in Paradise is a worthwhile 
book to read. Its agenda is to cele
brate the rise of the educated class 
and to uplift the spirits of bobo 
readers. Simply put, it is a guideline

Artist: The New Amsterdai/
Label: Vagrant Records
Final Grade/Bby Ryan Hamilton
Junior Staffwriter
Vagrant Records/is home to a 
handful of emo-puik groups, most 
notably the AlkaCine Trio, who 
recently made thamove from Asian 
Man Records. TKe labels newest 
release, The Nfew Amsterdams 
Never You Mind il more of he same, 
at least in genr/-name. They seem 
to have been eicompassed by their 
prefix, however, as the only punk 
elements left/are Matthew Pryor 
vocals (which carry over pretty 
directly from! his work as, the lead 
singer of Thfe.Get Up Kids) and the 
short song length.
The soundiof the album js largely 
acoustic, with simple, understated 
chord progressions underlying 
Pryprs simple, understated vocals 
as they emote through simple, 
understated lyrics. This makes, on 
the whole, for a simple, understat
ed album.
A simple formula, no doubt, but
XSH
t hat mixed results
one that, when it works, hits with 
enormous impact. This is especially 
true on the opening track Early 
Double Life, the stunningly beauti
ful Idaho, (with James Dewees on 
cello), and an almost tear-inducing 
cover of the Afghan Whigs When 
We Two Parted. (The most com
pelling 1:05 is the fifth track, 
which isnt even admitted as exist
ing in the liner notes or the track 
listing. It has the potential to be an 
amazing 2:30 song, but it induces 
more frustration than anything 
else. Its not so much a musical mis
carriage as a partial-birth abor
tion.) But the formula doesnt 
always work. The lyrics are liable at 
any time to become clumsy or to 
slip into cliched punk-trite. There 
' are also problems with track place
ment: track 11, Never Treat 
Others, is yet another highlight. 
Sadly, it largely serves to frustrate 
the listener with the inferior closer 
that follows. While no other tracks 
particularly stick out, the rest of the 
album isnt poor, and certainly 
above filler level. The problem is 
that they come off mostly as lesser 
versions of the albums better half. 
Never You Mind just misses the con
sistency needed to be a satisfying 
end-to-end listen, and you will skip 
tracks, despite its short 33 minute 
running time.
Never You Mind is more than 
worth the time put into listening to 
it, even if it is coasting on half of its 
songs. Its also an encouraging sign 
that the generally limited punk 
and even emo-punk genres have 
room to mature, musically, and 
do so without losing (emo)tional 
impact.
Willies Aim is Blue
Album Title: Milky Cow Blues 
Artist: Willie Nelson 
Label: Uni/lsland Records
Final Grade: Bby Debra Hal pern
Junior Staffwriter
One hundred and forty-one releas
es out and Willie is back.
Willie Nelsons latest album, Milky 
Cow Blues, is his first attempt at the 
blues, and its successful. Nelsons 
album brings back that Baby Blues 
feel with a low-key old fashion 
sound. His new album revives oldschool blues songs from as far back 
as 1922 along with Crazy, Wake 
Me When its Over, Night Life, 
Funny How Time Slips Away, and 
Rainy Day Blues  all of which he 
penned and revised from his 
younger days. If you like the true 
blues, Milky Cow Blues is the album; 
however, if you want the heavy gui
tar rock blues, stay away. The 
strength of the album is the low-key 
atmosphere that it creates. The blend 
of guitars, piano, percussion, har
monica, and the classic vintage B-3 
organ creates the quiet blues bar feel. 
The album intros with the tide
track, Milky Cow Blues, that makes 
all the Willie Nelson is a country 
singer skepticism disappear. The 
album appears to be a Santana ripoff, due to the fact that all the popu
lar contemporary blues artists 
appear on the album  Francine 
Reed, Keb Mo, Jonny Lang, Susan 
Tedeschi, B.B. King, and Kenny 
Wayne Sheppard, but without these 
guests Willies attempt at blues 
would fail.
The real star of the show is Willie 
Nelson, but the highlights of the 
album are filled by his guests. B.B. 
King uplifts Night Life by just 
singing one line  Listen to the 
blues playing  taking away from 
the passive repetitiveness of Willie 
Nelsons vocals. Unfortunately Willie 
sticks to that one sound, the sound of 
a drunken grandfather playing the 
blues with his buddies. Another key 
player on Nelsons album is Francine 
Reed, who sings with more soul, 
making up for Willies passive coun
try nature. Willies strongest 
moment by himself on the album is 
on the track Lonely Street where 
he sings a beautiful melody of 
melancholy, the way the blues was 
made to be played.
Milky Cow Blues is graceful to all 
the greats that it covers. From tracks 
one to 15, a blues lover will be 
pleased with Willie Nelsons efforts. 
He even ends the album with a bang 
with track Texas Flood featuring 
guitar prodigy Kenny Wayne 
Sheppard. The album is best-heard 
one track at a time, but due to the old 
fashion nature of the songs, it is hard 
to listen to the whole thing through 
with out being tired of the same 
sound.

As a 23-year-old investment banker with Salomon Smith Barney, Paul Leung and 
his team were asked to compile a list of suggestions that would illustrate how 
the firm could improve in the eyes of its junior-level analysts. Paul wrote a blunt 
memo highlighting 36 different ways the firm could increase the quality of life

improving relationships

responded by meeting 
immediately and refusing
to dismiss any outright. To Paul's surprise, the memo was leaked around Wall 
Street. He soon found himself in a press stormThe New York Times, The Wall

nd there. He introduced Chief 
/arrant Officer Kevin Laird, the 
rector of the Ambassadors. He 
ssumed this position in August of 
jis year. With his entrance, he 
lade^his only appearance of the 
ighrto direct his band. Afterward, 
jjirek took over, and led the 
jnbassadors in a modern piece 
rhile the orchestra took a break, 
fts swingy piece featured saxohone, trumpet and drum solos, 
rhose improv skills werent as good 
s Rutts, but entertaining nonethess.lThe band handled the syncoatiot and dynamic contrasts very 
rell,1 showing that they are capable 
f anything.
The Ambassadors brought out 
ieir vocalist next, Marva Lewis, 
ingijig The Nearness of You, she 
ombjmed Diana Krall and Ella 
irald in her style. While very 
oodi'.she failed to capture the 
moo'thness and easiness that is traitional in the genre. The band 
layed spectacular backup howevreminiscent of Nelson Riddle 
rrangements that backed up Frank 
iinatgi.
Th^r orchestra joined the 
ambassadors again, changing the 
nood. The next piece, Desojah 
i/as a combination between a symhony and a jazz piece, but didnt 
uite'mesh. It sounded like a piece 
junior high concert band might 
play.ilt was almost as if Pascuzzi 
vrote-a symphony and then a totaly different jazz piece, and haphazirdly' combined them. It lacked 
:oherence and any stylistic flow; it 
vas definitely the low point of the 
lightr
Any negative thoughts didnt last 
ongi~3iowever, as the band and 
irche^tra swung into a big band 
nedley by Billy Strayhorn. This 
ncredible composition combined 
he best big band standards, and 
:he playing by both band and the 
orchestra was nothing short of 
emarkable. It included versions of 
Don.t Get Around Much 
Anymore, and Take the A-Train, 
)ut the absolute best was the bari
tone sax rendition of Misty. This 
warm and soothing solo was the 
highlight of the night. The 26-year 
veteran of the band played with 
such heart and emotion, one could 
almost picture Ella Fitzgerald 
singing along with the ensemble. 
The soloists phrasing was perfect, 
holding back tempi and pushing 
forward with ease.
After intermission, the In Time 
Jazz Quartet played an original jazz
ence back to the glory days of 
Harlem, the way Ellington knew it. 
It was a very busy piece, with intri
cate harmonies and rhythms, but it 
was all played so smoothly and 
effortlessly. Overall, the lush and 
luxurious style that the ensemble 
brought to life embodied the story 
that the Duke wanted to tell.
The concert ended with another 
medley of big band tunes, this time 
playing April and Paris,
The Army Jazz Ambassadors captured 
the mystique and romanticism of the 
big band era this past weekend, and 
they proved to be the epitome of a bigtime big band.
composition, Escape. It was 
indeed a nice escape for the night, 
offering a different style of jazz 
altogether. The group, partly com
prised of PSO members, performed 
together nicely. The duel between 
the alto saxophone and guitar was 
quite pleasing, and left me wishing 
for more after they left the stage.
Next, the orchestra and band did 
quite an interesting move: they
had a jam session on stage. They 
played the twelve bar blues pro
gression to Ellingtons C-Jam 
Blues, and any member of the 
orchestra or band who wanted to 
show off improvisational skill was 
allowed. The order of the 
impromptu solos followed as such: 
trumpet, violin, trombone duet, 
and a very interesting English horn. 
Mr. Hamlisch himself even played 
piano next, and it ended with a 
slick cello solo. It was a very 
unorthodox idea, but well carried 
out. It proved to be quite a treat for 
audience and performers alike.
The penultimate piece on the 
program was Duke Ellingtons 
Harlem. This program piece tells 
a story, one that the Duke made 
intentional when he wrote it. The 
band and orchestra played this 
piece impeccably, taking the audi
Moonlight Serenade, and his 
famous, In the Mood. April in 
Paris was played warmly and sen
timentally, much like the whole 
performance. This was music that 
swept everyone off of their feet and 
made them want to dance. 
Moonlight Serenade featured 
wonderful interplay between the 
trumpets and the saxophones, tak
ing one back to the days when big 
band was in its glory. The orches
tral part in Moonlight Serenade 
was enchanting as well. The sweep
ing cello section mixed with the 
wonderful violin solo of Carnegie 
Mellons own Andres Cardenes 
made the piece absolutely perfect. 
The medley ended with In the 
Mood, which got the audience 
clapping and tapping their feet. 
This featured an unusual alto and 
tenor sax solo part, but the trumpet 
solo remained traditional. It was 
played with the same warmth and 
enthusiasm as the rest of the piece. 
They ended to thunderous 
applause and a hearty standing 
ovation. The Army Jazz 
Ambassadors captured the mys
tique and romanticism of the big 
band era this past weekend, and 
they proved themselves to be the 
epitome of a big-time big band.

entertaining. Its just that these 
guys are actually going to be in 
Pittsburgh this Tuesday night at 
Club Laga at 8 pm with guest acts 
Mos Def, Slum Village, Dead Prez, 
Bahmedia and Talib Kweli. So 
regardless of what I said about 
them, if you like sketch comedy and 
hip-hop, you should go. And keep in 
mind: I probably didnt like the 
show this past summer since I was 
distracted by those kooky charac
ters from The Real World: New 
Orleans.
If your idea of Pittsburgh athleti
cism involves The O and dodging 
traffic while crossing Forbes 
Avenue to get to Morewood, then 
you need some serious help. 
Fortunately, the Pittsburgh 
Sports and Fitness Expo will be 
held this Friday through Sunday at 
the David L. Lawrence Convention 
Center in Downtown. Theres going 
to be so much stuff there, including 
Steelers Experience 2000, the METRx East Coast Strongman 
Championships, a miniature Indoor 
Triathlon, an outrageous Extreme 
Sports Half Pipe Skate/Bike/Roller 
blade show, the GNC Womens Pro 
Fitness Championships, and even a 
visit from hometown WWF star 
Kurt Angle. For more information, 
visit http://www. pghsportexpo. com.
Sadly, you probably dont know a 
thing about CMU sports. If you 
would like to learn more about the 
athletics here,'this Saturday is the 
day to do this with a sports blowout 
right here in Gesling Stadium. It all 
starts off at 10 am when the wom
ens races of the Duquesne 
Cross-Country Invitational 
begin in Gesling Stadium. Then, at 
10:45 am, the mens races take off. 
Be sure to stick around until 1 pm 
where the football team takes 
on Franklin & Marshall. For 
extra credit, you can even experi
ence some buggy practice over 
by Flagstaff Hill. Just be sure you 
set your alarm clock in time for this 
6 am event.

When youre tired from all the 
athletic fanaticism you have dis

to take a nap. Thats because Tina

though she is 61 years old now, that 
woman is just so damn energetic. 
Why party on campus when you can

Last but not least, guess whos

to the concert to impress that Boy

I went to this convention the other day, 
it's called "People who talk 2 much 2k". 
There are people in this world who talk 
so much I'd like to punch them in the 
face. There are essentially 2 things to 
talk about in this world: seemingly 
important bullshit and gouda cheese.
By the end of the convention my knuckles 
were bruised and bloody, I had to punch 
so many intellectuals. There were people 
there who were pondering why they 
were pondering, and pondering how they 
can help people by saving the ponds, 
pondering pond life as it affects our life.
They were pondering by the pound, 
and I was pounding by the ponder. I had 
to wear boxing gloves to ease the pain 
on my delicate knuckles. I filled my 
gloves with pennies and began knocking 
teeth out. The pond talk spread across 
the convention in a frenzy of gabbing.

They began asking annoying questions: 
"Please we enjoy our teeth for chewing, 
can you cite specific examples of why 
you pound while we ponder? Why are 
you acting on your desires, you should 
intellectualize this violence in the form 
of questions, citing examples of course."

Teen music trio, third-party candidate visit Pittsburgh
DO PITTSBURGH!
by Greg Nofi
Entertainment Editor
Have all of your toys from the TOC and BOC 
lost their entertainment value? Is your Super 
Happy Fun Ball from that business-to-businessmarketing-solutions-integration-research-intellectual-property-consulting company broken yet? 
Thats enough corporate buzz words and goodies 
for now. Lets jump into 10 fun things in 
Pittsburgh that you can do this week now that you 
have a job. For additional information on these 
events, look them up in The Tartan calendar.
American radio has finally moved beyond 
MMMbop and onto a dozen more annoying 
songs that are just as, if not more, overplayed. 
Fortunately, Hanson has moved on from super
ficial teen-pop for good, proving that there are at 
least three American teenagers who have some 
brains. Their pop sound is much more rich and 
dense now, displaying more artistic talent than 
even Britney Spears display of talent and skin 
combined. You can check them out yourself this 
Monday at the A. J. Palumbo Center in Downtown 
at 7:30 pm. If youre looking for the Hanson 
Brothers from Slapshot, Im afraid youll have to 
go to Blockbuster video for that.
Are you looking for a good lecture on econom
ics? Arguably, the most popular economics lec
ture ever held on campus will take place when 
Green Party Presidential Candidate, I mean econ
omist, Ralph Nader comes to McConomy this 
Tuesday at 8 pm. He is certainly very knowledge
able on economics. Some people even say hes 
more knowledgeable on economics than most 
public figures, such as guys like George W. Bush 
and A1 Gore. Its certainly nice of Nader to share 
his vast understanding of economics, considering 
that he is in the middle of a Presidential campaign 
and all. He must be awfully busy making all those 
campaign speeches and trying to earn votes.
This Tuesday also marks the opening of the 
greatest musical of the Nineties: Rent, which is 
playing at the Benedum Center, Downtown 
through Sunday. Sure, any good ol Broadway 
show can earn a Tony Award. But lets get real 
here; the truly great shows are those that win a 
Pulitzer Prize as well. Man, I cant wait for the day 
when The New York Times wins a Tony. Those guys 
sure know how to bring in da funk and bring in 
da noise.
Last week I completely insulted MTVs Lyricist 
Lounge Show and called it the most uncomedic 
piece of work since Short Circuit 2.1 should prob
ably open my mouth and insert my foot. Its not 
that the show has gotten more funny or more

I went to the beach. I salv seagulls and dolphins there. They almost pooped on me. The 
seagulls, H mean. I have that kind of luck, though. You know, Im always in the wrong place 
at the wrong time. Like when this kid came up and went to punch this other kid on the play
ground and hit me instead. The he said, My bad" and hit the other kid in the chin. I guess 
some people are violent. Im not really violent. I don't have one of those bad sides like they 
say some people.do. Unless you count the time I burned ants with a magnifying glass. One of 
my friends said that it was cool to watch them melt. So I tried it.
In July, I went with my family on a road trip in a four passenger Pinto. There were five of 
us. I had to sit in the way back" which is really the trunk.. We stopped at this restaurant 
called, Moms" and they served lima beans. My dad told me I had better eat them all, or else. 
So I filled my entire mouth with lima beans. Every single one. Then I said that I had to go to 
the bathroom, but it came out more like, Mah maff moo mo ma maffwoom." I walked into the 
bathroom and spit them all out into a toilet. Since there were so many lima beans, the toilet got 
clogged and my dad had to get some cleaning person to come in and use a plunger to get the 
water running again.
I went to camp too. I met lots of friends and went swimming. One time I tried to dive off 
the dock and I smacked my head on the edge and I started bleeding in the water. There was 
this girl swimming there and she kept screaming, Bloooooood! Blooooood! Somebody call the 
nurse!" Then I climbed back onto the dock and felt the wound on the back of my head. Then I 
saw the blood 011 my fingers. Then I passed out. I woke up in the nurses office and she said, 
Wow, you really hit your head there, didnt you? And I wanted to say No shit," but I 
thought that was mean so I just said, Mmm hmm." She told me I was fine now, it wasn't 
that big of a cut, just that they were worried the blood clot might cause a brain hemorrhage, or 
that I was going to be in a coma for days. I looked around the room and the paramedics were 
standing there, smiling. One of them said, How do you feel now? and even though I realized 
H guess H did give a shit I only said, W.ell, Im sort of hungry, so they took me to the mess 
hall for dinner. That night we had to eat lima beans with the meal. I hate lima beans. Later 
on we had a campfire and we were sitting around the fire singing songs. We sang Who let 
the dogs out?" in rounds. It was fun. I love that song.

watch me walk the aisle. His eyes 
flash apologies-some detail 
forgotten. What troubles my love?Us

Mr. Dan was looking at his shoes as they slipped and trickled over the fallen maple leaves. 
They were brownthat is, the shoes, not the leaves (which were also brown, but he hadn't really 
realized that because he didn't choose to). The sidewalk fell under his swinging feet like a seg
mented gray river, dotted with earthworms and decomposed paper trash. Mr. Dan concentrated 
on trottingyes he wanted to trot, not stagger or walk or sashay. Trying to look upbeat, with the 
world at his feet (which it was, and there's the irony, reader retard) Mr. Dan trotted up Ford Street 
with his hands in his pockets to disguise the boner he just accomplished from thinking about Mrs. 
Pleminger at work. All of a sudden, not half of a sudden, he heard a little voice cheep out like an 
Easter candy from a nearby porch. The girl, marked as such by her overgrown hair and open 
face, was leaning over her porch railing like a sacrifice. Mr. Dan looked up and noted that her hair 
was much the same color as his shoes (but again, not the maple leaves, because he never regis
tered their presence in his mind of minds). This silly little girl, such as she was, had fat cheeks 
made rosy by the brisk fall air, and a pork-fed air of Mormonness about her. Her lips looked like 
fragile envelope seals, turned up against themselves. Mr. Dan felt his boner become even more 
insistent than it had been before, the blood squelching in and not out.
She called, "Hey! What's your name?"
Mr. Dan ceased trotting and instead plodded, his face angled down to catch the least possible 
of the September sunlight. He ignored her and noticed instead a blade of grass which had stuck 
to the bottom side of his shoe and now clung, resolute. He wiggled his ankle to fling the grass 
away, but it wouldn't fling.
''What's your naaaaaame?" This time, her voice held on 'name' and swung it back and forth 
like a tire swing. From his periphery he felt her beady brown stare, healthy and clean and 
undoubtedly washed in all the proper places. Mr. Dan tried not to think about her sweet rubber 
limbs, made peachy by the direct sun.
"Hey you!" This was a command issued directly to our Mr. Dan, and to his mind as well, 
where he was still a zitty tall boy at boarding school, knees locked in the certain knowledge that 
he would someday, dread, forget the capital of Argentina. So he ceased plodding and minced. 
Minced up the sideway like a meat pie, passing the little girl and her porch and her house and her 
correct yellow dog and thin mother somewhere most probably with a PTA sticker lurking. As Mr. 
Dan made a herculean effort to mince without appearing suspicious to the people who may have 
been looking but really never were, the damn damn girl still hung from her iron-wrought porch 
rail, following his escape with her young bitch eyes.
"Mister!" Her idiot parrot voice peaked a new soprano, and the silly squeak of it all fell on Mr. 
Dan's waxy ear. It was inexcusable really, how this unbehaved girl should be addressing perfectly 
innocent strangers as if she had some right. Where was her mother? Mr. Dan's boner began to 
hurt, and would be more than a bit embarassing if another grown-up chanced to pass him. He 
pinched his fall coat around the front, hunching his shoulders because he was busy busy busy 
and he didn't hear the little girl calling at all. This was, of course, the problem with kids these 
daysno discipline. This girl should have her little bread pudding ass beaten for this type of pre
sumption. But of course, that was not allowed these days, so Mr. Dan had to feel her silly seashell 
ears pointing at him as he minced by. On a public sidewalk for Christsake. .
"Mom!" Now, of course, freakin' Shirley Temple would tattle on Mr. Dan for not answering 
her. So what if he was shy, and really not of the reputation to be talking to little girls half-off from 
their porches without fear of repercussion? This would not matter to the mother, soccerball under 
arm and wrath in her fashionable bangs. She would call him a pervert. A child molestor, by god! 
A sick, inhumane, heartless monster blah blah blah and more pop-words etcetera. It would ruin 
him, even if there was no proof he had ever contemplated her bread pudding ass. And there was 
none! How could there be? And yet, Mr. Dan should be cautious.

---------------------------------------------------

He halted his mince, and skewed right, plodding back to the spot on the sidewalk direct
ly in front of the little girl's porch. He stopped, and slowly slid his gaze from his feet in 
maple leaves to her. Her.
"My name is Mr. Dan." His voice felt icky like the worms. "What's yours?"
"My Mom said not to tell strangers." So she stared at him, her bottom lip falling out 
big as a landscaping stone. He stood, perplexed. What to do now... with her brown 
thick hair looking so much like chocolate pudding. And see, the way her small fingers 
spread wide from her pat-pat hands like sensitive tentacles...they gripped the iron rail
ing's black curlicues.
As Mr. Dan contemplated a legal response to hasten his departure, he felt a sudden 
WHACK on the back of his neck, and he was falling, forward and down and over the 
rough pavement with barely enough time to reach up his arms, and the odd numbness 
in his back spread cold lower and lower. He heard the cheep "Mommy, Mommy!" as his 
cheek slammed down against the wet sidewalk, with a metallic sliver he knew was his 
teeth slicing his vulnerable inner cheek to shreds. Mr. Dan moved in confusion and fear 
to turn over, see his attacker, and tried also to cover his precious skull with his arms. As 
he sought to roll over with his icy-thud spine, he felt the vague, foreign rustling of 
someone's hand in his back pocket. Emptying his back pocket. He couldn't believe that 
he'd been robbed! He'd never been robbed before-this didn't make any sense. The 
whap-whap-whap-tap-tap-tap-tip of feet slapping the street away from him, the criminal 
was getting away.
"Mommmmmmmmmy!" Four swings at least, with upkicked feet to gain the most 
inertia, and legs and arms tucked tight on the decline for optimum speed. The swinging 
little stupid voice in her fat pudding brown and white face felt all the way down his 
frozen spine and smelled also like the ground beside his nose where a maple leaf 
seemed to be the exacf color of her hair just before he fell into dark and tired.
