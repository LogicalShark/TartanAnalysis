Six Added To Senate; 
Committee Jobs Open
Three freshmen and three new upperclassmen were 
added to the roll of Student Senate at the Senates last 
meeting on Tuesday, October 4. Ray Guydosh, chairman of 
the Senate Rules Committee, announced the selection of 
the new Senators.-------------------------------------------
They are: Elaine Goodstein 
(freshman), womens dorms; H. 
Karl Krummel and John John
son (both freshmen), mens 
dorms; and Phil Mason, Bob Coynack, and Karen Wiseman (all 
upperclassmen), commuters.
Four freshman commuters 
were also supposed to be named 
to the Senate. None submitted 
petitions, though, so their seats 
will be left vacant, leaving a to
tal of seven independent commu
ters in the Senate.
The commuter deficiency is 
not as great as it seems, accord
ing to Guydosh, because last 
years election committee had 
overestimated the commuter pop
ulation of the school.
Because of the work involved 
in; choosing the new delegates, 
the Rules Committee has not yet 
done any work in revising the 
Senate bylaws. Chairman Guy
dosh is still looking for interest
ed students to work with him on 
this project. Lloyd Patross, VicePresident of Senate, says one of 
the major features of the bylaw 
revision will be to change the 
procedure for spring elections to 
provide seats for incoming fresh
men.
Committee Reports
Chairmen of other Senate com
mittees also gave reports at the 
October 4 meeting. Sharon Rambo, chairman of the Student Un
ion Committee, is soliciting sug
gestions for improvements in Skibo. She sees need for improve
ment in both facilities and 
services.
Ben Stahl, who is in charge 
of TGIF dances, announced 
that he plans to hold "about
14 TGIF s during the course 
of the year. Tim McFeely, Co
ordinator of Student Activities, 
has increased the TGIF budget, 
but Stahl feels that more funds 
are still needed to get goodquality bands.
The Senate finance committee 
has yet to meet with the treas
urer of Student Government. An 
explanation of the functions of 
the finance committee was read. 
These functions are: (1) To work 
with the treasurer to outline a 
budget for student government, 
and (2) To evaluate requests for 
money by student organizations.
CClub Holds Raffle
The Varsity C Club, Car
negie Techs varsity athletes club, 
will sell tickets today through 
Friday in Baker Hall lobby for 
its Homecoming raffle. Prizes for 
the raffle are a Homecoming
 ootball and a free weekend (or
* refund if the winner has al
ready bought his ticket). Tickets 
will also be sold at the gate be
fore the football game with Grove 
City, and the drawing will take 
P-ace at half time. The winner 
need not be present.
The C Club was reorganized 
last year to encourage the de
veloping school spirit and support 
for varsity athletics.
The General Campus Commit
tee will be working on improve
ments in the bookstore and on 
parking facilities.
Need Workers
Once again, Vice-President Pat
ross issued a call for interested, 
responsible students to work on 
the international and external 
committees of the Senate. Appli
cation can be made at the Skibo 
information desk.
Patross especially wants 
members for the food service 
committee, which will be split
ting the direction of food ser
vice 50-50 with Mr. Price. 
(Mr. L E. Price is the Direc
tor of Food Service.)
The next open meeting of Stu
dent Senate is next Tuesday, 
October 18, at 4:30 p.m. in the 
Wherrett Room in Skibo.
SixxiAdeTo naTit;t Merger 
As C;tm J;xxbA sOmOa;
by Sue Attinson
The biggest thing in American education during this decade, according to one top 
Mellon Institute administrator, is the proposed merger of his institution with Carnegie 
Tech. It is the best combination of facilities, says Charles Willingham, Mellons head 
of professional relations. He goes on to say that the Institute might have chosen instead 
to maintain itself as a scientific apartment house or established a third university in
the Oakland community.

Take Deferment Test 
Now, School Advises
The Selective Service Qualification Test will be given 
on November 18 and 19, 1966, at the University of Pitts
burgh, according to present plans. Should the number of 
registrants increase beyond Pitt's capacity for seating, it 
will be given at other centers, the locations of which will be 
announced later.Early Application Best
According to the Educational 
Testing Service, which prepares 
and administers the test, a stu
dent has the best chance to take 
the test at the time and place he 
desires, if he registers early.
Each student wanting to take 
the test will be given a packet 
containing a card on which he is to 
fill in his name, address, and 
when and where he would like to 
take the test. He will also be 
given an instruction sheet and 
an envelope to be used to mail 
the card to Educational Testing 
Service. This card must be post
marked no later than midnight, 
October 21.
It is mailed back to the stu
dent, and he uses it along with 
his draft card as his admission 
card to the examinations.
Up to this time Carnegie has 
advised students that it is pre
ferable to take the Selective Ser
vice Qualification Test after the 
completion of the freshman year, 
since there was evidence that 
freshmen did not score as well 
on the test as upperclassmen. 
However, some local boards are 
taking action to reclassify a stu
dent if he has not taken the test. 
This has happened even in in
stances where the student has 
attained the appropriate rank in 
class, making him eligible to con
tinue his present classification. 
On the basis of this situation, 
stemming essentially from the 
fact that the local boards are au
tonomous, Tech now advises stu
dents to take the test at the 
earliest time. If the student 
wishes to defer taking the test to 
a later date, it is strongly sug
gested that he check with his 
local board prior to taking such 
action. A student or registrant is 
allowed to take the test only once 
during his academic career. If 
the registrant failed the test pre
viously, this does not qualify him 
to retake it. Selective Service 
headquarters informed Carnegie 
Tech that the Selective Service 
Qualification Test may be given 
next spring. No specific date has 
been set as yet, and no definite 
information is available.
Applications and information 
for the November 18 and 19 
Selective Service College Quali
fication Test are now available 
from Mrs. Mary Ryan, special as
sistant to the Dean of Men, in 
Warner Hall 210.
Dorm Parties
Mens Dorm Council will spon
sor Homecoming parties in Donr.er Hall lounge after the Friday 
night bonfire and the Saturday 
night formal dance.
Friday nights party will last 
until 1 am and the Saturday night 
affair will go until 2:30 am. Both 
parties are open to all dorm resi
dents and their guests.
MDCs fall social calendar also 
includes a Halloween mixer on 
Saturday, October 22 and a 
Thanksgiving party on Saturday, 
November 19. Both these events 
are set for the Donner lounge. A 
large-scale Christmas party is be

cember 9 or 16.
Tau Beta Pi 
Calls Eighteen
Carnegie Tech Gamma chapter 
of Tau Beta Pi, national engi
neering and science honorary, has 
announced its calling of new mem
bers for this semester.
In the first semester of each 
school year, Tau Beta Pi calls 
seniors in engineering, seniors in 
science, and four honors juniors 
in either engineering or science. 
During the second semester of 
each year, TBP calls juniors in 
engineering only.
The call for fall semester 
1966 is: seniorsEvan M. Melhado, Michael M. Cook, Bruce 
R. Gelin, Richard J. Wilders,

FPF Presents 
Senator Clark
FPF (Foreign Policy Forum) 
was organized last semester by 
students disturbed by the lack 
of knowledge, concern, and inter
est at Carnegie Tech about United 
States foreign policy and will be
gin a series of assemblies with 
the presentation of Senator Joseph
S. Clark of Pennsylvania.
Senator Clark, who is a mem
ber of the Foreign Relations Com
mittee, was elected to the United 
States Senate in 1956 and reelected 
in 1962. He will speak on the topic 
Agenda for Peace on October 18 
1966, at 11:30 am in the College 
of Fine Arts Little Theater. Other 
speakers will appear in Decem
ber and January.
The next meeting of FPF is 
scheduled for October 12, 1966 
at 4:30 pm in Skibo. Questions 
may be referred to Ellen Berg
man, 682-8824.
Early in its history, Mellon In
stitute was the Mellon Institute 
of Industrial Research and School 
of Specific Industries at the Uni
versity of Pittsburgh. It was bom 
from the idea of Dr. Robert 
Kennedy Duncanthe idea that 
the resources and methods of 
physical science could and should 
be applied to the problems of in
dustry. In 1911, through the in
fluence and financial support of 
brothers Andrew W. and Rich
ard B. Mellon, Dr. Duncan was 
called to the University of Pitts
burg to establish a department 
of industrial research.
The Institute continued its ac
tivities as a part of the Univer
sity until 1927, when it was in
corporated as the Mellon Insti
tute of Industrial Research (later 
shortened to the Mellon Insti
tute.) Since that time it has op
erated closely with both the Uni
versity and Carnegie Tech.
Designed for Scientists 
The eight story building on 
Fifth Ave., occupied by the In
stitute since 1937, has more 
than 200 laboratories accom
modating one to three investi
gators each. Encircled by 62 
monolithic columns, it receives 
natural lighting from four in
terior courts.
The fourth floor (ground level 
from Fifth Ave.) serves as a site 
for various business and admin
istrative facilities as well as the 
library. The majority of the re
search laboratories are located on 
the floors above. The three floors 
below the fourth are devoted to 
conference rooms, an auditorium, 
shops, research services and spe
cial laboratories which require un
usual facilities. Glass blowers 
make instruments calibrated to 
the specifications of Fellows. 
Chemicals are dispensed, and 
copying and calculating machines 
are made available at a fee, 24 
hours a day. The Institutes in
vestment in modern scientific in
strumentation for advanced in
vestigations of molecular systems 
is currently valued at about $4 
million
The Institutes library contains 
950 periodicals and 40,000 vol
umes. This material includes 
journals in chemistry, mathemat
ics, physics, associated technol
ogy, and a large collection of 
reference treatises. It is open to 
graduate students and Fellows.
The auditorium and several 
lecture rooms afford meeting 
places for seminars and colloquia 
covering various topics of inter
est to the staff. Some of these 
sessions function jointly with the 
neighboring academic institu
tions; others are sponsored by lo
cal scientific and technical socie
ties.
A 230-acre tract of land in 
Westmoreland County houses

AWS Improvements Bring 
Approval, Further Plans
The Association of Women Students (AWS) has elect
ed Marilyn Blitz as president. Other officers are: first vicepresident, Pat Bowman; second vice-president, Susan Har
ris; third vice-president, Sheila Byrne; secretary, Margie 
Appleman; and treasurer, Nancy Dew.
The organization is trying to
alleviate problems in the dorms 
and to create better relations be
tween the students living on cam
pus and commuters. Dorm facili
ties, such as the ditto machine, 
television, libraray, listening room, 
recreation room, and sewing room, 
are avaailable to commuting wom
en. Miss Blitz also stated that 
commuter cots may be set up in 
rooms for overnight, and commut
ers are invited to all AWS func
tions.
Discipline problems that arise 
are handled by Pat Bowman 
and the Judicial Council. Pen
alties are now decided for each 
infraction separately, replacing: 
the previous uniform punish
ment policy.
Joint activities will be spon
sored by AWS in cooperation 
with Men's Dorm Council. AWS 
wants to include Mudge and 
graduate women in these func
tions also. Other plans include 
the annual art exhibit and sale, 
a Morewood mixer to be held 
every two months, and the pur
chase of a typewriter for the 
use of all women students. AWS 
is also working to eliminate any 
food and contract problems ac
cording to Miss Blitz. Progress is 
being made in order that E tow
er apartments and Colonial Man
or will be the best possible on 
campus.
The administration is pleased 
with work of AWS and is anxi
ous to see it continue. Miss Gail 
Kruman, the new Assistant Dean 
of Women, is alert and receptive 
to student problems, as a result 
of experience on Pitts student 
government.
AWS at Carnegie Tech is only 
a temporary member of the na
tional AWS, because it has only 
been in existence one and a half 
years. In order to be granted full 
membership, the chapter must be 
two years old.

Tech Departments Strong, 
According To Quality Study
For some months now the academic world has been 
buzzing over the contents of a thin, blue, paper-backed book 
published by the American Council on Education, entitled 
An Assessment of Quality in Graduate Education. Of the 
28 academic disciplines, Carnegie Tech offers graduate de
grees in nine, and although none of these departments was 
rated first, all received respectable ratings.
Evaluation was undertaken ac
cording to two different sets of 
criteria: quality of graduate fac
ulty, and effectiveness of the 
graduate program. The study 
pointed out the University of 
California at Berkely as the most 
outstanding center for graduate 
study in America today. Close
ly following are Harvard, Stan
ford, Columbia, Illinois, Yale,
Princeton, Cal Tech., M.I.T., Chi
cago, and Wisconsin.
Carnegie Tech received the 
following ratings of quality of 
the graduate faculties: 13th in 
economics, 21st in physics, 14th 
in chemical engineering, 12th 
in electrical engineering, good
(just below numerical rating) 
in psychology, chemistry, civil 
engineering, and mechanical 
engineering, and adequate 
plus in mathematics.
In this rating system, the top 
four or five in each subject were 
termed Distinguished; other 
numerically ranked departments 
are Strong; below these are 
Good, adeaquate plus, and 
finally adequates, marginals, and 
those too poor to provide satis
factory doctoral education.
In the ratings according to 
effectiveness of the graduate 
program, no Carnegie Tech de
partment was rated Extreme
ly Attractive"; however, among 
the Attractive list, econom
ics was ranked 11th, chemical 
engineering 13th, and electric
al engineering 14th. Accept
able plus departments were 
psychology, chemistry, physics, 
mathematics, civil engineering, 
and mechanical engineering.
Economics was one of the dis
ciplines whose rating is given 
special explanation in the study.
This explanation makes it clear 
that ratings closely parallel num
bers of publications, and that 
most currently published papers 
in economics are produced by a 
relatively small group of authors 
at relatively few colleges.
The Distinguished category 
in physics includes Berkeley, Cal 
Tech, Harvard, Princeton, Stan
ford, M.I.T., Columbia, Illinois, 
and Cornell. Carnegie Techs 
physics department, placed 21st, 
was outranked by only Cal Tech 
and M.I.T. among the institutes 
of technology (they were not 
included separately in the study, 
but were compared directly to 
major universities).
Similarly, Carnegie Tech was 
the only institute of technology 
whose psychology department 
was rated at all, and in math, 
the only schools of the same 
type as Carnegie Tech which 
were rated higher were M.I.T.,
Tech, Purdue, and Rice.
Among engineering depart
ments, those of M.I.T. are clearly first in all cases. The next in
stitute of technology is usually 
('al Tech, with Carnegie Tech 
third. Such showings for Carne
gie Techs engineering depart
ments are encouraging in view 
f the fact that doctoral programs 
at Carnegie Tech are relatively 
recent compared to those of the 
other ranked schools.

Industry Must Tell More 
About Jobs, Says Stever
A communications breakdown is taking place between 
employers and universities, Dr. H. Guyford Stever, Car
negie Tech president, explained at a recent conference of 
the Middle Atlantic Placement Association. Dr. Stever 
went on to say that employers have not done a good job 
of showing students their true character.
The result has been widespread
student disappointment with their 
initial jobs.
More and more good lives are 
being ruined because of job hop
ping for short-term financial gain, 
when a really meaningful life 
could be constructed by continued 
growth in a single corporation, 
he told city reporters after his 
speech.
A students university experi
ences, he said, give him little 
idea of what to expect in the bus
iness and industrial world.
In a university, Dr. Stever 
pointed out, a student may 
solve dozens of engineering 
problems a week. But when he 
gets out and gets a job, he finds 
that a real problem in areonautics may extend over a decade 
or two.
He may also find himself in 
a situation where he has to sell 
himself and his ideas to peo
plesomething he never had to 
do on campus.

He added: How many studdents who study creative writing 
know what the real world of 
creataive writing is like?
To the Tartan he explained that 
placement people themselves are 
not that involved with specific 
companies in industry. He stressed 
self-motivation.
The interested young person 
should do some looking into 
the field itself, he said. Other
wise hes going to get caught 
some day where he doesnt want 
to be.
The school should provide a 
good educational offering and cli
mate for enrichment.
Said the president; Interest in 
ones own life can and should be 
developed.

Exhibit
Carnegie Techs Department of 
Painting, Design and Sculpture is 
hosting an exhibition of contem
porary Yugoslavian prints through 
next Friday, October 21.
The Yugoslavian prints, part of 
an international exchange exhi
bit sponsored by the Memorial 
Union of Oregon State University 
are on display in the College of 
Fine Arts Hewlett Gallery from 
9 am to noon and 1 pm to 4 pm 
on weekdays.
Contemporary Yugoslavian art
ists whose works are represented 
in the exhibit have inspirations 
from the worlds of objects and 
abstractions. The interpretations 
range from pure objectivity to 
non-objectivity.
The Yugoslavia print exhibit, 
one in a series of exhibitions to 
be sponsored by the Department 
of Painting, Design, and Sculp

professor of civil engineering and 
associate director of the Trans
portation Research Institute 
(TRI), is directing the study. The 
project continues to June 30, 1967, 
under the grant provided by Penn
sylvanias Department of Public 
Instruction. Because the study 
merges with the overall research 
and educational program at the 
Institute, funds were granted un
der the states higher education 
act.
The project is being undertaken 
in recognition that present trans
portation technology (for exam
ple, urban bus systems on con
gested highways, or fixed-rail sys
tems which are restricted by 
grade and curvature) represents 
a narrow range of alternatives 
from which to develop meaning
ful transpoprtation solutions, Dr. 
Hoel said.
The purpose of the TRI study 
is to evaluate concepts of a 
geometrically flexible, lightweight transportation system 
and its application within urban 
areas.
Transportation planners recog
nize that if rapid transit systems 
are to be effective they must be 
flexible to immediate and future 
community needs, Dr. Hoel said, 
Transit systems must provide im
proved coverage in residential 
areas and central city districts 
based on population and employ
ment patters, not on grade and 
curvature restrictions. Such cov
erage, he said, implies greater 
route length than is economically 
feasible with conventional sys
tems. The answer, he suggest
ed, may lie in structures carrying 
light-weight, smaller vehicles.

Tripled Foreign Contingent
by Sue Attinson
Carnegie Techs foreign student population has tripled 
during the past decade. Currently, the 215 such graduate 
and undergraduate students come from 40 countries other 
than the United States.
India, with 63 and China, with 
29, claim the largest representa
tion. The 16 from Canada and 10 
from France compose the next 
sizeable groups.
No institution actually goes 
out and recruits foreign stu
dents, says Earl R. Swank, dean 
of men. He points to the schools 
continued hospitality since the 
1920s as a reason for continued 
interest. Prominent faculty and 
research projects also provide 
an attraction.
Consortia with other American 
universities have helped to devel
op technical schools in India, Afganistan and the Philippines. 
What results from the establish
ment of such groups is an ex
change of both faculty and stu
dents.
Exchange programs have also 
been instituted with various min
istries of education. Such an ar
rangement in home economics 
was thwarted by a lack of French 
language proficiency on the part 
of possible Carnegie Tech parti
cipants.
Finances Difficult
Living in the United States is 
more than they can afford, many 
foreign students discover. When 
you can attend college (at a cost 
of $40 per semester) and live 
comfortably on $80 a month, the 
cost of an American graduate 
education is far beyond your 
means.
Thus, the percentage of finan
cial aid is high among non-American students who are not eligi
ble for loans or much part-time 
employment.
Any graduate student is assumed to be beyond his parents 
support and every effort is made 
to provide financial aid,, says 
Swank.
Previously, foreign undergrad
uates could receive no financial 
aid until they had attended 
school for a year. Now, such ap
plicants are evaluated for schol
arship aid on the same basis as 
their American classmates.
Mudge Graduate House offers 
mostly double rooms and a menu 
of both vegetarian and meat 
meals for those who choose to 
live on campus. But through the 
housing office foreign graduates 
who prefer to live in their own 
apartments are given references.?
Orientation Sought
We do not try to structure 
the everyday experience of the 
foreign student, Dean Swank ex
plains. Rather, we adopt the at
titude that he is here for profes
sional training and strive to help 
him become a part of the univer
sity community.
The students name is sent to 
the Pittsburgh Council for Inter
national Visitors. It refers him to 
a host family, preferably with 
one member in his field of inter
est. Simultaneously the Y assigns 
him to a Carnegie Tech student 
guide. After a summer corres
pondence, it is this guides re
sponsibility to acquaint his charge 
with registration procedures and 
campus life. Soon after registra
tion, all new foreign students 
are invited to a reception with
Dean Swank. This year, the Y 
program will invite all such stu
dents to a November coffee 
house. ____________________

Anthone Review
A Cumbersome Evening 
With Pirandello & Albee
by Tony Lawrence
An evening spent with the above two playwrights could have 
been an exciting one indeed. The choice of plays was good, but the 
subsequent productions were generally lacking.
The first offering was Luigi Pirandello and titled The Man with 
the Flower in His Mouth. It is a fine play dealing with the brief 
encounter between a commuter who makes a hesitant stopover in a 
somewhat innocuous bar. When he enters he finds a man sitting at 
a table across the room who opens the conversation with a simple: 
Missed your train, eh? From then on we learn through some fairly 
skillful dialogue that this particular bar hopper is stricken with a 
fatal disease. Pirandello poses some interesting questions with this 
play. What does a man do with himself when numbered days are 
all that he has left? The audience wonders whether he really does 
lake time to watch how precisely and carefully a clerk might wrap 
a package, as Pirandello states. Also, does a man destined to die 
truly think about possibly killing another individual; thinking the 
consequences could be only minimal? Or would they?
Unfortunately the production only hinted at these items. 
Surprisingly the reasons the play became vague were very sim
ple. First of all the diction was poor, especially that of the Man 
as played by Greggory Lehand. I was beginning to think that 
perhaps Mr. Lehane had a golf date or some other pressing en
gagement the way he literally raced through the lines, throw
ing any established tempo or pacing to the wind. Consequently 
many times the play appeared as an acting scene rather than a 
full-length one-act play.
Im afraid the real fault lies with Marcia Godich, the director. 
She undoubtedly felt no need to control either movement or timing. 
If The Man with the Flower in His Mouth had not had such an 
obvious theme, the play would have been even more vague than 
previously mentioned. One felt very little, if any, pathos or sympa
thy for the Manrelating his dying thoughts to a total stranger 
who in reality was just a commuter played by Richard Rauh who 
did a most competent job.
The second bit of fare in the two one-act offerings floundered 
much more miserably than the first. Either Kathi George (who di
rected The Zoo Story) felt that the play would be enhanced (which 
it wasnt) by adding unnecessary elements to a play that hardly 
requires them, or perhaps she just completely misunderstood Albee 
altogether.
The first glimpse of the set made clear the fact that we 
were in for a somewhat cluttered hour. The excessive set decora
tions like a trash can, an extra park bench, an elaborate paper 
niache tree, an extra stump, and even a sign with bold letters 
KEEP OFF THE GRASS all eventually became what they appeared 
crutches for the actors. The actors, however, were at fault too. 
Jerry, as played by Donald Flayton, failed to relate the subtleties 
and yet the intense character of Jerry. Rather, he used a lot of 
bothersome eye rolling and other various nervous gestures which 
were all in vain. Consequently Jerry became almost a comic individ
ual. Evidently the audience felt likewise, because when, at the end 
of the play, Jerry is stabbed and turns to Peter, his murderer, and 
solemnly says: You won the fight, but you lost your bench, there 
should be utter silence, and numerous snickers could be heard. The 
knife entering Jerrys stomach was staged away from the audience 
and was effective only until it dropped to the ground and was re
vealed as both bloodless and folded. Only lack of rehearsal is re
sponsible for details like that.
True, there were some decent and honest moments in the pro
duction, such as when Peter begins to compare Ben Jonson to Bau
delaire and Marquand. Also, several of Jerrys transitions wene 
quite good. On the whole, Albees declaration that man is still bas
ically an animal failed to gel with the Friday Night Repertory The
atre at the University of Pittsburgh. The presentation in general 
wandered aimlessly and made us all sort of secretly wish that we 
might have gone to the zoo instead.

V olunteerGuides 
Needed To Lead 
Visitors Tours
The Admissions Office is 
currently seeking sophomore, 
junior and senior volunteers 
in all departments to serve 
as student guides.
Guides serve as tour leaders 
for prospective Tech students and 
their parents who have come 
for an interview. During the 
hour-long tours of the campus, 
guides talk frankly about life at 
Tech, trying to associate inci
dents in their own experience 
with each area visited. After the 
formal tour is finished, guides 
may candidly discuss Carnegie 
Tech and answer any questions 
the student or his parent has.
Training is very informal. 
Guides are given a handbook and 
accompany two or more sample 
tours with more experienced 
leaders.
The guide system formerly was 
on a salary basis. Students re
ceived $1.25 for each tour. At the 
time, all guides were male and 
nearly all were in Engineering 
and Science. To expand the pro
gram to include coeds and stu
dents in all departments, as of 
this year, it has been put on a 
volunteer basis. The money in
stead will be used for an annual 
dinner, and for other similar 
projects.
Students who are interested in 
serving as guides should contact 
Ken Marx at Sigma Nu, or the 
Admissions Office. Coeds and 
men in Fine Arts are especially 
needed.
Head of the guide program is 
Ken Marx. Guides for this year 
are Bill Dillon, Lloyd Patross, 
Bob Rosen, Dale Peschel, Fred 
Reidel, Bob Bogart, Charles Walk
er, Alan Witchner, Marisa Ram
irez de Arellano, Collie Langworth, Nancy Mosca, Nancy Gug
genheim, Pat Caro, Sue Ward, 
and Sally Glassberg.

'Flood, Fire, and Famine"
Mademoiselle
by Stan Thomas
Half-way through Mademoiselle a strang thing happens; the film 
begins. Mademoiselle was directed by Tony Richardson, mentioned 
last week; in connection with Tom Jones, based on a scenario by 
Jean Genet, and stars Jeanne Moreau as a spinsterish school teacher 
referred to only as Mademoiselle. The film actually begins with Miss 
Moreau opening a flood gate, but dressed for church or at least the 
streets. Mr. Richardson then establishes the plot. There is an Italian 
woodcutter in town who seems to be sleeping with all the wives in 
the village; therefore, the husbands all hate him. Since he has ar
rived, there have been a number of fires and now a flood. Of course, 
the outsider is responsible. Of course. Of course, we in the audience 
know that Mademoiselle is responsible for all the disaster because the 
camera is always around when she perpetrates evil even if no one 
from the town happens to be there. Whether shes a vicious woman 
or just likes disaster or what, is not definitely established halfway 
through the film when Mr. Richardson throws in the beginning 
of the story. It is supposed to be a flashback, but it simply makes 
everything heretofore a slightly odd prologue.
Because this is an art film, the director gives us the middle 
first, then the beginning and the end. The tim e-space continuum 
is not sacred or unbreakable in a film, art or not, but when tell
ing the story from the middle and then catching up on the begin
ning before going on to the end only confuses the issue; one 
wishes Mr. Richardson were brave enough to forget about his re
sponsibility in making an art film and start from the beginning.
O.K. We finally find out that Miss Moreau is obsessed by the 
Woodcutter and although they do meet and it is established that this 
man likes women a lotto the detriment of every husband in town, 
it seemssome how he and Mademoiselle dont get together until she 
has set several fires, caused a flood, and poisoned the livestock with 
arsenic. And everyone in town is out to get her loved one. The issue 
is further confused by the very physical presence of Miss Moreau. 
How any Italian Woodcutter could pass her up for the local house
wives could only be beyond Mr. Genet. Mr. Richardson even bypasses 
the opportunity to photograph Miss Moreau so that the strange ugli
ness of her features triumphs over her peculiar kind of beauty. An
tonioni did it in La Notte, perhaps to the determinant of the star 
Moreau, but for the good of the woman Moreau was portraying. 
Somehow the essential clue to the character is missing in this film.
Somewhere in what I maintain is the beginning of the film which 
actually occurs in the middle, Madmoiselle tells her class of Gil de 
Rais and the corrupt French court. She then brings up Joan ctf Arc 
and the scene has shifted from the classroom to Mademoiselles 
bedroom where she is putting on make-up preparing to set a fire 
or something. Perhaps we are to see Mademoiselle as a 20th century 
Joan whose voice is sexual repression, and who is truly a witch, 
who puts the world on the pyre and instead of saving France is bring
ing it to ruin. Perhaps. Who knows? Mr. Richardson is so busy 
making an art film that content is lost to context.
Anyway, Jeanne Moreau is currently to be seen at a badgood film at the Guild. If you dont arrive late enough to miss 
the beginning which I find more and more superfluous to the 
rest of the film the more I think about it, you can always nit 
the phallic symbols until Mademoiselle puts on her make-up, 
spike heels, and net gloves: that means floor, fire, or famine. 
The woodcutter is played by Ettore Manni who occasionally 
wears a snake in addition to a belt.

Kibbee Supports Plan, 
Freedom From Politics
If adopted and implemented, the (Pennsylvania) Mas
ter Plan for Education will result in significant advances 
in both the quantity and quality of higher education in 
Pennsylvania over the next five to ten years, according to 
Dr. Robert J. Kibbee, vice-president for planning at Car
negie Tech.
Page 6-CARNEGIE TECH TARTAN-Wednesday, October 12, 196<S
Speaking on The Master Plan 
for Higher Education, at the 
Public Affairs Forum held in the 
Golden Triangle YMCA in Pitts
burgh last Thursday, Dr. Kibbee 
called the plan, as outlined in the 
report of progress presented to 
Governor Scranton, a sound, 
reasonable and useful start on 
the development of Pennsylvan
ias system of higher education. 
Dr. Kibbee said that the future 
of higher education in Pennsyl
vania is endangered less by the 
inadequacies of the Master Plan, 
than by the political timidity 
of some and the political demogoguery of others who seem more 
than willing to sacrifice the edu
cation of our youth to their own 
personal ends. He pointed out 
that while he does not agree with 
every recommendation contained 
in the plan, he thinks it can and 
will do the job.
Reduces Political Pressure 
Discussing the criticism of the 
establishment of a single Council 
on Higher Education of the State 
Board, which, under the Plan, 
would develop a high-quality pro
fessional staff under a Commis
sioner for Higher Education, he 
said that the concept attempts 
to provide a rational forum com
prised of interested and honor
able men, where differences can 
be resolved and compromises ag
ree upon before the issue is in
troduced to the political arena.
With the Councils provided for 
in the plan, he said, the prob
lems of higher education are as
sured careful consideration and 
study. What is not assured and 
what should not be assured, Dr. 
Kibbee continued, is that the so
lutions to these problems will be 
sought without concern for the 
problems of basic education. 
Choices and compromises are 
made now, he said, and they, 
would be made if there were a 
separate Board of Higher Edu
cation, but they are made and 
would be made in the legislature, 
by men subjected to a multitude 
of political pressure with School 
Board Associations, ParentTeachers Associations, School 
Principals Associations, Alumni 
groups, and an assortment of lob
bies from our colleges and uni
versities tugging and hauling ag
ainst each other for a slightly 
larger slice of the revenue pie. 
The proposal that is implied in 
the Plan offers an opportunity 
for decisions to be made in an 
atmosphere more conductive to 
reason and more appropriate to 
the ideals for which support is 
being sought.
Pointing out that the trend 
in society is toward more com
prehensive grouping of similar 
activities, not away from it, Dr. 
Kibbee said that the arrange
ment developed in PennsylCarlin To Speak
The first meeting of the Car
negie Tech student affiliate chap
ter of the American Chemical So
ciety will be held on Wednesday, 
October 12, at 8:30 pm in DH 
1112. Featured speaker will be 
Dr. Robert Carlin, head of the 
Chemistry Department. A social 
hour will be held after the meet
ing at the Theta Xi fraternity 
house. All interested students and 
faculty are invited to this organi
zational meeting.
vania Is not against the tide 
of the future, as some suggest, 
but actually ahead of it.
Dr. Kibbee cited the criticism 
that the plan has not worked thus 
far, and argues that three years 
of existence is hardly a fair trial. 
The ultimate success of any 
board or council depends upon 
whether or not the political arm 
accepts the idea that this is a 
reasonable way to handle our 
educational business and is there
fore willing to support it. In this 
respect, he continued, Penn
sylvanias recent efforts have got
ten off to a shaky start. The> 
Governor, having conceived of a 
rather ingenious mechanism for 
integrating the entire educational 
establishment, and having made 
some excellent appointments to 
the new body, has failed on sev
eral occasions to give the Board 
and its Councils the kind of 
courageous political support it so 
desperately needs.
By neglecting to provide the 
Board with an adequate staff, 
he immediately reduced its ef
fectiveness. When, in the Albert-in-Wonderland case of In
diana State College and the 
Olmstead Air Force Base inci
dents, he chose political exped
iency over the advice of his 
Board and its Councils, he ser
iously weakened the Boards 
authority and destroyed its 
public image.
Dr. Kibbee said that the ideas 
emanating from the camp of po
litical opposition hold no more 
promise for the future. The 
Democratic candidate has al
ready made the Board of Educa
tion a political football by re
ferring to it as the ScrantonShafer Board and dooming the 
hope that education might es
cape the spoils system. He has 
also pieced together from dissi
dent comments a Master Plan of 
his own based on economic pre
mises so naive that one wonders 
if he is serious, and fears that 
he is.
Role of Private Schools 
The second major criticism of 
the plan, Dr. Kibbee stated, is 
that it gives short-shrift to the 
role played by private institu
tions in the future of higher edu
cation of Pennsylvania. He indi
cated that the crucial point in 
this discussion centers on the na
ture of the public service per
formed by these institutions in 
educating Pennsylvanias youngs
ters and added that although 
there is a superficial element of 
truth in the statement that pri
vate higher institutions serve a 
public service, they do so in a 
way that is much less direct 
and much less controlled, and 
much less complex than that in 
which the public institutions 
serve the Commonwealth. The 
kind and level of financial sup
port proposed for the private and 
public institutions reflects this 
difference in purpose, control, 
and completeness, he said, as 
it rightly should.
Dr. Kibbee stressed that the 
survival of private institutions 
depends on those institutions 
offering students something 
different and more desirable 
than can be found at a public 
college or university. This 
may be exceptionally high 
quality, an atmosphere of close 
relationship between faculty 
and students, a spirit of innoFlyers Sponsor 
Pittsburgh Area 
Flights Oct. 22
The Carnegie Tech Flying 
Club will take interested 
members and non-members 
on a flight over Carnegie 
Tech and the Pittsburgh 
area on Saturday, October 
22. The ride, which lasts for 
half an hour, will cost $3.00. 
Reservations can be made on 
October 18 and 20 from 
11:30 to 1:20 at the bottom 
of the stairs in the Skibo 
Cafeteria.
Reservations can also be made 
by writing to the Flying Club, 
Box 260, Skibo. Anyone who will 
need transportation to the field 
should specify this when making 
reservations. The planes will be 
piloted by licensed members of 
the Flying Club, and will takeoff 
each following half hour from 
8:30 am and continue as long as 
necessary.
Anyone who is interested in 
learning to fly can still join the 
club. Meetings are every Wednes
day in PH 126B at 7:30 pm. Dues 
are $2.00 to join the club and $.50 
each following month. The meet
ings consist of free ground school 
classes taught b y Professor 
George Renninger of the Physics 
Department, films and speakers. 
The purpose of the ground school 
is to prepare members for the 
written exam. Members then have 
two years to accumulate their 
flying time and take the flying 
test for their license. The club, 
which was started a year ago, 
now has 40 members. One-third 
of the members have already ob
tained their licenses.
The Flying Clubs purpose is 
to give Tech students the op
portunity to learn about flying at 
reasonable costs. The club also 
hopes of owning its own plane 
in the near future.
Falk Lecture Today
Edgar Z. Friedenberg, Profes
sor of Sociology at the University 
of California and author of Com
ing of Age in America, will talk 
about Empiricism and Benevo
lence as Factors in Aggression 
at 4 pm this afternoon in the GSIA 
Auditorium.
This speech is the second of 
two by Friedenberg in the open

vation and experimentation, 
particular spiritual or ethical 
values, or some combination of 
these," he said.
Summarizing his position, Dr. 
Kibbee stated, The Master Plan 
for Higher Education, adopted by 
the State Board of Education in 
Pennsylvania. It is not a great 
document, nor does it suggest a 
solution for every problem. Its 
principal advantage is that it 
establishes a structure, that if 
implemented, will serve as a 
useful mechanism to plan sound
ly for the future. Whether or 
not the mechanism will work can
not be attributed to the Plan, but 
to the political atmosphere that 
surrounds it. The best interested 
of Pennsylvania and its youth 
will serve by adopting the Plan 
now and strengthening it later. 
To scrap what has been done on 
the grounds that it is not perfect 
will only set the Commonwealth 
back another three years.

week at its meeting last 
Wednesday.
Joe Orens, President of Student 
Body, said the appointments were 
delayed because Executive Coun
cil still hadnt received a nom
ination for a justice from the 
womens dorms, and had received 
only one petition for commuters 
justice. He expected a court to 
be chosen, however, at yester
days meeting of Executive Coun
cil.
Last year Student Court did not 
try any cases. Under the present 
constitution it is chiefly a court 
of appeals. Disciplinary cases 
tried and decided in the courts 
of CFP, Panhellenic Council, As
sociation of Women Students, or 
Mens Dorm Council can be ap
pealed to Student Court.
Several Student Government of
ficials have expressed interest in 
enlarging the functions of the 
Court. This does not necessarily 
mean giving Student Court juris
diction in areas where the low
er courts now prevail. One of 
the most promising ideas so far 
is a combined student faculty 
disciplinary board. The College 
Council, composed entirely of faculty members, now tries all seri
ous cases of student discipline and 
decides on expulsions.

Homecoming Defended
Editor, the Tartan
In what appears to be more of 
a post mortem than a forecast of 
Homecoming Weekend, the Oc
tober 5 Tartan editorial has label
ed the weekend a boring repeti
tion and one devoid of ima
ginative thinking. We feel that 
this criticism was timed poorly 
and was exaggerated unfairly.
It was stated that the stu
dent . . . has had virtually no say 
in what a Homecoming program 
should contain. Last March when 
plans were initiated for Home
coming, an appeal was made to 
the campus via the Tartan for 
volunteers and suggestions. Every
one had an equal opportunity to 
serve on a committee. There are 
many students from every fac
tion of the campus involved with 
the weekend. All suggestions were 
considered and discussed in com
mittee, and the final program for 
Homecoming was voted on by all 
committee members.
At all times, we were open for 
suggestions; at no time did the 
editor or any Tartan representa
tive approach the Homecoming 
Committee with new ideas or 
constructive criticism. Last weeks 
editorial-one week before Home
coming, when most plans were 
completed for the weekend-was 
the first Tartan comment on 
Homecoming. None of the opin
ions in the editorial were pre
sented to me or any member of 
the Homecoming Committee be
fore the editorial was printed.
Not only did the editorial lack 
constructive criticism, but it 
seems very inappropriate at this 
time to try undermine the entire 
weekend when we are right in 
the midst of promotion and ticket 
sales. Financially, the success of 
the weekend is solely dependent 
on ticket sales. The Homecoming 
Committee receives no money 
from Student Government, con
trary to what was stated in the 
editorial. Therefore, the effect of 
the editorial only could have 
been to hurt campus spirit and 
enthusiasm for Homecoming and 
to hurt the weekend financially.
One argument made in the edi
torial stated that this Homecom
ing would be a carbon copy of 
previous big weekends. Natural
ly, there are certain traditions 
inherent in big weekends here, 
especially Homecoming. These tra
ditions are meaningful for they 
provide a continuity to the week
ends and give Carnegie Techs 
Homecoming a uniqueness and 
identity. Therefore, to implement 
the program, it is necessary to 
build around such traditions as 
the Friday night concert, Home
coming game and Saturday night. 
We have attempted to add diver
sification with the Vaudeville 
Variety Show. The campus re
sponse has been excellent and 
we are confident that the show 
will be novel and entertaining. I 
do not see how the editorial could 
compare this to any previous pro
gram. (It is not a talent contest, 
nor is it similar to sorority skits.) 
Also, who is foresighted enough 
to pass judgment on the show be
fore it takes place?!
The program emphasized 
school spirit at a time when 
spirit is needed most at Tech. We 
feel that Homecoming is an ideal 
time to generate enthusiasm on 
campus. It is towards these ends 
that the Bonfire and Pep Rally 
have been scheduled for Friday 
night after the concert. The edi
torial stated that scheduling the 
Pep Rally for after the concert 
was poor timing and that the 
Pep Rally was one of a hastily 
concocted series of unrelated 
events. The Pep Rally was sched
uled as it was for specific rea
sons. After discussing this with 
the cheerleaders, administration 
and alumni coordinators, it was 
decided that although students 
would be relatively dressed up, 
attendance would be best at that 
time; students would be coming 
from the Music Hall and would 
stop at the Bonfire. Fraternity 
houses will be closed until after 
the Pep Rally, since this is an 
all school event. Also, alumni will 
attend the Pep Rally, as part of 
their program, which they would 
not have been able to do other
wise. (I might add that the mud 
pit behind Morewood has been 
filled in, so students will not have 
to worry about their good clothes 
dirty!)
Simon and Garfunkel in concert 
Friday night do represent a change 
in entertainment from previous 
years. They are not folk singers 
as such, and they are not the 
same type of commercial folkrock singers as The Mitchell Trio, 
Lettermen, Brothers Four, or the 
New Christy Minstrels. Their

Techs New Scottie Keeps 
Funloving Tradition Going
by Ken Marx
A familiar sight at Saturdays football game will be an 
oversized, overheated, lovable, nutty dog. To go along with 
a new winning football team will be an equally new Scottie 
Dog. This years school mascot is Murray Dickman.
The story on Scotties pedigree 
is not too clear: It seems that 
some 7 or 8 years ago, a drama 
student decided that the school 
really needed a handsome-looking Scottie Dog. Tuition being 
much lower at that time, he per
sonally bought a uniform for 
the school. The story goes that
after a few years of filling in 
as Scottie, the student departed 
Tech; somehow the suit was pas
sed on to a new master, Jim 
Levy, who chased the cheer
leaders around for a few more 
years. Ken Marx learned what a 
dogs life could be like when 
he became Scottie two years ago. 
Tired of chasing Tartan skirts 
only to discover that they be
longed to Kilties, Ken has given 
up his leash and turned over his 
portable turkish bath to his suc
cessor.
ScottieFor Fun
Scotties role in life is often 
misunderstood. He cant do cart
wheels, despite the pleas of the 
band, and is too uncoordinated to 
even climb the goal posts without 
some friendly assistance. Scottie, 
according to Ken Marx, is there 
to have fun. Fun is where you 
find it, and Scottie has fun in 
the stands, in the sandpit, on the 
field, and especially with the 
cheerleaders. In the past, when 
the team was having its troub
les, Scottie tried to find the 
light side in the game. Creating 
havoc with the cheerleaders and 
the band was Scotties attempt to 
entertain the fans and try to
Murray is going to find that he 
has some entertaining compe
tition in the football team itself. 
Hopefully, our fun loving friend 
will still do his part at the 
games. To our new Scottie, we 
send our fondest puppy love and 
best wishes for a good year.
keep a spark of interest and en
thusiasm alive. Often futile, Scot

the right spot as with the Home

Who says Pittsburgh isnt an exciting city? The following 
are some of the things that are happening and are talked about 
in Pittsburgh.
* * *
As we go to press (Sunday) the promise of real excitement is 
in the air: a pitched battle between the New Left and Old Left is in 
the offing.* Vice-president Humphrey comes to town Tuesday night 
at 8 pm to speak at the Penn Theatre for the famous, unlimited 
budget, movie-producer Milton Shapp, sometimes Democratic gu
bernatorial candidate. Humphrey, representative and ex-official of 
the neo-Fabian Americans for Democratic Action (ADA) will be 
confronted by the legions of pickets and demonstrators of the New 
Left, the Students for Peace, and the Pittsburgh Committee to End 
the War. There is much talk among tacticians whether the delaying 
Fabian tactics of Vice-president Humphrey can match the revolu
tionary activists of the New Left. The only tragedy is that the Tar
tan hits the street Wednesday; thus our readers will miss th'i major 
action. However, perhaps some minor skirmishes will still be going on. 
* * *
Although we leave the sport scene to more competent commen
tators, an important news item has come to our attention. This is 
the renaissance of the architects football team. Having on Saturday 
assured themselves a place in the playoffs by extending their win
nings to four straight, the architects seem to be the sleepers in the 
sport usually dominated by the fraternities and grads. Their resur
gence is so remarkable (witness: in each game they have scored 
more than they did all last season) that there is talk of mass mental 
capitaluation by their competitors. Perhaps some documentation of 
this phenomenon of psych-war will turn up today at 4:30 as the 
architects play their last league game against the powerful Beta As. 
* * *
Current campaign: Stop buying Saran Wrap, product of Dow 
Chemical Co., also major producer of napalm for the Vietnamese 
war. Also stop buying U.S. Savings Bonds, a service of the United 
States of America, belligerent in same war.
* * *
Winner of recent disc-derbies and definitely a platter to watch 
for on the charts is the Shapp-Kaufman song (to the time of Pass 
Me By) by Lois Perelman.
We give you two fine men by the name of Kaufman-Shapp 
Bound to win the voters mandate with a snap.
Unlimited energy these fellows have on tap.
Both ordain a time of growth for Pennsylvania.
With men so politically astute,
Legislation shoots the stars.
So root for Shapp and Kaufmann, theyre sure goin to wih it, 
Gerry Kaufman, Milton Shapp, our stars,
Lucky us, both these candidates are ours.
We bring you Shapp and Kaufman, bound to make the scene,
And it isnt often we get such a team 
Of honestly gifted men, a Democratic dream.
Gerrys handsome, Shapp will use the same old mansion.
Put your money on these thoroughbreds,
Cause were headin for the stars.
So root for Shapp and Kaufmann, theyre sure goin to win it, 
Gerry Kaufman, Milton Shapp, our stars,
Lucky us, both these candidates are ours.
(We realize that to some there misfht be confusion. In the New Left Lexicon 
anyone to the risrht of them is obviously fascist; hence, read battle between New 
Left and Right Win*. For vice-president Humphrey, read Gauleiter Humphrey.*)

He who speaks of enemies is himself the enemy.
Brecht.
In the modem theatre today, few playwrights have achieved the 
almost god-like status of Bertolt Brecht. Brecht, who worked for a 
short time in the sweatshops of Hollywood, was a modem German 
playwright and theoretician. His innovating dramatic theories, strong
ly colored by Marxist-pacifist convictions, have achieved consider
able force and fashion in the new American theatre.
Now in Pittsburgh, the Pittsburgh Playhouse is presenting from 
October 7 to November 13 the early Brecht play, A Mans a Man.
A Mans a Man is the story of how the inoffensive prole
tarian dockworker Galy Gay is transformed into the ferocious 
"human fighting machine Jeraiah Jip.
It is a brilliant, offbeat, black comedy, a parable 'having some
what the quality of a George Grosz drawing crossed with an early 
Max Sennet comedy.
When the curtain opens we know we are back in the 1920s: 
on stage, are three marvelous chorus girl types dressed in garish 
costumes, one is playing a trumpet, one a wash basin, and the last, 
a tiny honky tonk piano. The whole production is highly unreal 
bizarre, colorful; the soldiers are represented as grotesques; 
irightening inhuman types with stylized white masks for faces.
The point of. the play, Mr. Brechts thesis, is a Marxist one, 
namely that man today is merely a cypher, an interchangable be
ing. whose function is determined by the needs of the system, e.g. 
capitalism.
Also like Mother Courage, this is an anti-war play; it shows 
decent human beings can be changed into artificial fighting 
machines.
Whats all this bother about people? asks one of the soldiers 
in A Man's a Man. One is the same as none at all. You cant even 
speak of less than two hundred at a time.
A nihilistic point of view pervades the work as a whole; at 
one point the martinet sergeant Bloody Five, unable to curb his sex
ual appetite, castrates himselfa rather drastic solution, I thought 
to myself at the time.
This is certainly not the stuff of Broadway musical comedy, but 
it is exciting, provoking theatre.
The production is brilliant. John Hancock has directed Brecht 
in just the right way, not overdoing the effects as in Tony Rich
ardsons production of Arturo Ui.
The acting is uniformly perfect; especially good is the Brendan 
Behan-looking Charles Durning as Galy Gay.
An interesting historical footnote, and an ironic finale for this 
piece is the fact that Peter Lorre played Galy Gay in the original 
Berlin production of A Mans a Man in 1931. This seems like a far 
cry from the Warner Brothers Peter Lorre, we all remember, and 
it certainly illustrates Brechts moral, which closed the first act: This 
world is a dangerous place.

style of music is unique, and they 
are the first currently popular 
group to appear here in some 
years. (I doubt that we could have 
afforded Harry Belafonte or the 
Pittsburgh Symphony with our 
Homecoming budget!)
The biggest objection of the 
editorial seemed to be about the 
strict rock n roll music of the 
Saturday night dance. We feel 
that this type of music appeals 
to the majority of the campus; 
and from past dances at Skibo, 
the most successful dances have 
been those with rock n roll 
bands. However, we have added 
a slow dance band, The Don Wade 
Trio, who will play in the Wherrett Room throughout the even
ing.
The Saturday night dance is 
not formal, but semi-formal, i.e. 
suits for men and cocktail dresses 
for girls.
The student body is not at the 
mercy of the Homecoming Com
mittee. The success of Home
coming can only be evaluated by 
each individual who participated 
in the activities of the weekend. 
In other words, the success of 
Homecoming depends on YOU.

sick and tired of attending a 
concert of folk music injected 
with popular motifs and occas
ional jokes for about the sixth 
or seventh consecutive time (in
cluding the Carnival concerts), 
Ill be damned if I am going to 
try to survive another experience 
of this sort again!
The same can be said about 
the dance over at Skibo on Satur
day: It gets to be a pretty long 
night when one has to dance
to rocknroll music for about two 
hours in a hot, sweltering ball
room and then go back to the fra
ternity house for the same reci
pe (except at least there is 
booze at the house) for another 
three hours.
My question is, why, year af
ter year, do the people on the 
Homecoming Committee assume 
that the majority of students pre
fer just the same basic diet of 
the past big weekends? At least 
something ought to be done about 
the Friday night concert. I think 
that having a jazz group or at 
least a program including both 
folk and jazz music might be a 
refreshing and enjoyable change 
of pace. Why not have the Four 
Freshmen, Dave Brubeck, Herb 
Alberts TJB, or Cal Tjader?
As for me, Ill be taking in a 
good movie with my date while 
the other people are hopefully 
enjoying Simon and Garfunkle 
at Carnegie Music Hall.

What the students want is (in

they decided to let the school 
know what Cwens are. Founded 
at the University of Pittsburgh in 
1922, and installed as the Eta 
Chapter at Tech in 29, the Cw
ens are a Sophomore honorary 
sorority dedicated to foster lead
ership scholarship, and fellow
ship among their class members 
and to promote the interest of 
the college or university in every 
way possible. Cwens, an AngloSaxon word meaning Queens, re
flect goals of leadership, grace, 
and poise.
Traditionally, the Cwens have 
served as guides during Fresh
man Orientation and Parents 
Weekend, and are willing to 
usher for any school event. In 
the past, they have sold sun
dries in Morewood Gardens. This 
year, they will sell Mums for 
the Homecoming football game 
and hand-made thistles (Techs 
Flower). Profits are given as a 
scholarship to one of the Cwens 
of next year.
There are now approximately 
twenty Cwens chapters in the

Learning Center Bases 
Versatility on Computer
Dr. Lee Goldman, head of the Painting-, Design & Sculp
ture Department, served this summer as consultant in the 
Learning Research Development Center. In this capacity, 
his ideas in computer-oriented teaching devices were pub
lished in the September issue of The American Home maga
zine. His objective was to speculate about what could be 
developed, and what could be done with designs already 
formulated for a Family Learning Center which could be 
installed in homes and offices.
Dr. Goldman begins with the 
assumption that there are al
ready in existence many compu
ter-like instruments in every 
home. For example, an iron is 
programmed to perform certain 
functions when plugged in. The 
telephone is another such device. 
What is more, people are con
stantly learning while in the 
home. A fusion of learning and 
programming elements would 
lead ideally to a computer which 
can be programmed for any spe
cific task: reporting the names 
of all books related to a certain 
topic; presenting geometric shapes 
which change as a control board 
is changed; or teaching spelling 
words. This idea is already prac
tical; calling on the phone for 
the weather report is a simple 
illustration. In theory, such learn
ing devices are similar to tools 
such as pens or slide rules in 
that one must learn with them 
and make his own mistakes in 
the process.
One very practical and neces
sary application of home com
puters is pointed out by the over
population in public schools. Chil
dren could learn academic sub
jects at home, since people learn 
at different rates, the computer, 
unlike the human teacher, can 
be adjusted for the individual. 
For adults, the computer can 
speed otherwise tedious research. 
Also, an extra dimension is add
ed to learning experiences by al
lowing the student to look, read, 
and hear simultaneously. This 
allows juxtapositions that are not 
possible by non-automated meth
ods. Also, more knowledge can 
be kept at hand, as the computer 
can store information in a small
er span than, for instance, books.
Specifications
Certain specifications have been 
devised by Dr. Goldman to maxi
mize the utility of the Family 
Learning Center: (1) The unit 
should be as flexible as possi
ble to allow one to open it or to 
close it from the home environ
ment; (2) Nothing in the study 
area should be fixed, but rather 
should be mobile as required for 
various purposes; (3) Facilities 
should be so arranged that peo
ple could gather for conversa
tion, or obtain privacy in cubi
cles; (4) Facilities should pro
vide for full use of all the senses 
so that one can learn by other 
means in addition to the writ
ten or spoken word; (5) The 
room itself should be neutral so 
that a person can make it his 
own, to suit himself; by putting 
in what he wants, his individual 
personality can be expressed; 
(6) Dr. Goldman prefers a flat 
surface to program the computer, 
rather than a bulky one. He en
visions something like a plane

surface with keys like a type
writer.
The computer is organized 
by human laws, and really is 
not magic. It can of course be 
misused in various ways. A 
person who relies on it too 
much may not learn all he 
should, for it must be used in 
conjunction with other meth
ods. Natural firs't-hand experi
ence is still very much needed. 
The machine itself is devoid of 
moral or human attributes, and 
thus people are needed for bal
ance. The major downfall, ac
cording to Goldman is in not 
understanding what the com
puter is doing. Then, of course, 
it can be programmed wrong 
in the first place.
Dr. Goldmans conception of 
the Family Learning Center is 
not idealistic or extreme. It need 
not be more expensive than a 
telephone to operate. Already 
he has received several inquiries 
from companies interested in the 
project as a method to help their 
employees. Also, a physical ther
apist who realizes the teaching 
potential of the computer has 
contacted Goldman. Says Dr. 
Goldman, Learning is knowing 
how to gain access to stored facts 
and organizing them once you 
find than. The computers in the 
Family Learning Center put ev
ery member of the family in 
contact with these facts, as well 
as with sense experience. The 
broadening of human perception 
can be the wonderful result of 
this machine.
Mixed Dining OKd
As of Monday of this week, 
men will be allowed to use their 
food contracts to eat at Morewood for the evening meal. This 
was decided at the first meeting 
of the Food Management Commit
tee last Thursday. Those who 
wish to take advantage of this 
opportunity are asked to sign up 
by noon of the same day in room 
201 of Skibo. At present, there is 
a limit of 25 on a first-come firstserved basis. This limit may be 
increased if there is sufficient de
mand. It was also decided that 
women from Morewood will be 
allowed to eat in the Skibo con
tract line after the opening of 
the Tartan Grill.
E&S Faculty 
Holds Assembly 
WithMellonStaff
Faculty members of the 
College of Engineering & 
Science met with the profes
sional staff of Mellon Insti
tute this Monday to hear 
discussions on the proposed 
Carnegie Tech - Mellon mer
ger. A full report on this 
meeting, held in the Skibo 
Ballroom, will be printed in 
next weeks Tartan.
As of last Wednesday, William 
W. Mullins, Dean of E & S, said 
he did not expect the meeting to 
produce any definite plans for 
the merger, such as timetables or 
reassignments of personnel.
We are still trying to for
mulate the question that have 
to be answered, says Mullins. 
Details of the merger are not 
in a decision phase yet. This is 
an analytical phase.
Mondays meeting marked the 
first time the entire E & S fac
ulty has been assembled with 
the whole staff of professional 
researchers at Mellon. Several 
small committees of E & S ad
ministrators have been confer
ring regularly with similar groups 
from Mellon ever since the mer
ger was announced on Sept. 14.
The E & S faculty itself has 
already met once en masse con
cerning the merger. Dean Mul
lins called a general meeting 
Sept. 22 to let all the people in 
the college know what was hap
pening. Only two men from 
Mellon Institute were present 
then.

Admissions Trends Follow 
Academic Developments
In keeping with a changing Carnegie Tech, admissions 
policies and procedures have also undergone a number of 
changes. In a recent Tartan interview, Mr. Kenneth J. 
Wenger, Director of Admissions, pointed out several trends 
in methods of recruiting and selecting students.
While class sizes are remain
ing nearly constant, the geo
graphical distribution of students 
in these classes is widening 
greatly. Pittsburgh and Pennsyl
vania admissions are steadily de
creasing, and more students from 
distant states can be found at 
Carnegie Tech.
Mr. Wenger pointed out that 
this is largely due to the work 
of the Carnegie Admissions Coun
cil (CAC), a group of some 400 
alumni serving high schools 
across the nation. These alumni 
are selected and trained to act 
as consultants in career forums 
for secondary school students 
and as such benefit not only Car
negie Tech but also contribute 
generally to education.
Social functions for Carnegie 
Tech applicants, students already 
admitted, current students and 
parents allow CAC to develop 
closer relations with students. 
New follow-up methodsforms, 
phone calls, interviews, and in
formation about Carnegie Tech 
are paying off in increased appli
cations from the students involv
ed.
Also working closely with CAC 
are such performing and touring 
groups as Carnegie Techs Came
ron Choir and Kiltie Band, which 
have brought interested inquiries 
from Boston, St. Louis, and New 
York City in the past year.
Activities Emphasized
In recent years, the caliber of 
applicants has reached the point 
at which nearly all are academ
ically well-prepared to succeed at
Carnegie Tech. Mr. Wenger in
dicated that as a result of this, 
there has been increased empsasis on a non-academic items. The 
present application form is far 
more specific in the area of ex
tracurricular activities, singling 
out categories of publications, 
drama, music, community, etc., 
and asking the applicant to rate 
these items in importance to 
him.
The rise in academic compe
tence and diversification is illus
trated by scholastic Aptitude 
Test scores of Engineering and 
Science freshmen. Three years 
ago the average math score was 
about 650, the verbal about 560. 
Math quickly rose to over 700 
and has leveled off at about 600, 
while verbal has been steadily 
rising to the present average of 
602.
Changing Demands
Mr. Wenger stated that the 
increase in verbal aptitude re
flected in part the changing de
mands of engineering and science 
education. Modern scientists must 
be capable not only of doing their 
professional work, but also of 
communicating it to employers, 
colleagues, and students.
Carnegie Tech also followsup students who are offered 
admission but do not attend Car
negie Tech. Among Margaret 
Morrison and Fine Arts admis
sions, there is no particular set 
of schools to which the non-ma
triculating students go, but in 
E&S, seven schools account for 
some 50 percent of students who 
do not choose Carnegie Tech.

Tartan Interview . . .
Pete Seeger
by Jeff Evans
On the night of the Seeger concert, the pickets in front 
of Carnegie Hall were out in full force. Two or three men 
were brandishing signs against pink Pete, dispensing 
leaflets listing Seegers alleged Communist record and an
nouncing a forthcoming program on the Danger of Com
munism with speakers who believe that the Beatles are 
beating a hypnotic rhythm aimed at the infusion of Com
munist propaganda into the minds of our students.
The hall was filled. Having _______________________________

Pioneer in Research
At the Institute, the investiga
tions of industrially sponsored 
groups, are, in great measure, 
devoted to long-range pioneering 
research. Through studies of elec
tron spin resonance of paramag
netic defects, progress is being 
made in understanding the de
tailed characteristics of color 
centers in irradiated simple sili
cate glasses. Food, felt, petro
leum, organic and inorganic ma
terials, and mechanical metallur
gy are also representative areas 
of active sponsored research proj
ects.
Basic studies are being carried 
out in polymer chemistry. The 
establishment of hygienic proce
dures for the production, hand
ling, and use of new chemicals of 
commerce is the subject of suc
cessful and continuing sponsored 
research, begun more than 25 
years ago.
Independent research studies 
are now under way in a doz
en broad areas of chemistry 
and physics which are support
ed by the Institutes endow
ment funds and government 
grants and contracts. 
Functionally, the Institute as a 
center for both pure and applied 
research is also a traning school 
for advanced scientists and a 
clearing house on specific scien
tific information for the public. 
Through the cooperation of Car
negie Tech and the University of 
Pittsburgh more than 230 men 
and women have received their 
advanced degrees while employ
ed in scientific research. The 
average stay of Mellon scientists 
has been five years since most 
such personnel have continued 
their contributions at the spon
soring organizations.
Toward Progress
During the past 54 years 
more than 60 books, 370 bulle
tins, 3,000 research papers, 1,- 
570 patents and many miscel
laneous articles in profession
al and trade journals have 
been written by Institute per
sonnel.
Over 650 processes and prod
ucts have been invented or de
veloped by Fellows of the Insti
tute. In a number of instances 
fellowship inventions have cre
ated new industries, such as the 
Vising Corporation, Plaskon Com
pany, Inc., and Dow-Coming Cor
poration. In other cases new 
branches have been added to 
existing manufactures, the most 
outstanding example of which 
is the chemicals division (now 
Union Carbide Chemicals Com
pany) of the Union Carbide Cor
poration. This was the pioneer of 
the present petrochemical indus
try which embraces chemicals de
rived from petroleum.

clerical responsibilities. Building 
services are managed by about 
70 and 40 are employed parttime.
Willingham notes that because 
the members know each other 
on a first-name professional bas
is, the self-supporting Institute 
environment permits the scien
tist to get his job completed in 
a minimum of time.
With regard to the nature of 
staff organization after a merger, 
Willingham pointed to existent 
joint appointments. He explain
ed that the Mellon Fellows might 
expect to do more teaching. We 
have specialists who do not teach 
who might inherently want to 
teach in areas not covered by the 
present university staff. And the 
university professors might find 
the Institute a place to consult 
and collaborate.
But many technical problems 
of re-organization have not yet 
been solved. According to Paul 
C. Cross, Mellons President and 
Chief Executive Officer, the ques
tions are still being accumulated 
by both Carnegie Tech and the 
Institute. Before they are an
swered, no further announcement 
of a merger will be made.
never experienced Pete Seeger* 
in person all I could expect at 
this point was a man in the dress 
of the working class with a voice 
of forced sincerity and perhaps 
a few leaflets of his own. From 
my seat downstairs, I could see 
only a slight predominance oi 
students in the audience; middle 
class Pittsburgh was apparently 
well represented. I had been told 
that Mr. Seeger had a cold and 
might not be able to see me after 
the concert, so I was not sur
prised that the lights went down 
almost 15 minutes late.
The man was tall, casually 
dressed; red striped tie on yel
low shirt, and walking shoes. As 
I sat waiting for the opening ti
rade of protest, Pete Seeger took 
up his banjo, and thought I 
dont quite remember the title of 
the first song, I do recall that it 
was something in the Oh, Suzanna class, songs that I didnt 
think were used much anymore. 
The audience, however, was 
warmed up well before the per
former was. My own foot was 
tapping long before he rolled up 
his sleeves in a ready for busi
ness manner.
And business it was. When 
the songs got around to stop 
the war and bring our boys 
back many people were offend
ed and felt that they had to ex
hibit their patriotism by walking 
out. The middle-aged couple in 
front of me didnt leave, but 
through most of the program re
mained unmoved. The few min
utes that the wife turned toward 
her husband and braved a smile 
she was met by a self-righteous 
glare. A well-raised, very younglooking coed in the next aisle 
remained tight lipped hands fold
ed trying to look bored, though 
now and then I detected a quiver 
of her right foot in time with 
the music. Indeed most of the 
student crowd was in time with 
Pete Seeger, clapping, shouting 
requests.
After the concert I was led 
with a crowd of autograph seek
ers to a small white room back
stage where the man, seeming a 
foot taller and with the look of 
a lanky, sandy-haired Johnny 
Appleseed  with a cold  was 
preparing to depart. The inter
view was short. He felt that what 
he had to say had been said.
Pete Seeger has been accused 
of being a Communist and a Paci
fist; but he, according to one 
song, would be the first out 
there fighting if our shores were 
invaded. As for the people who 
apparently came to the concert 
just so they could walk out, he 
feels that if they cant sit and 
listen to the other side, he does
nt want them. But how about a 
song itself? It seems that it 
v/ould have such a transient ef
fect on the majority of the audi
ence. What good does it really do 
to sing a song? No more good 
than voting, was the reply.
Pete Seeger, as he hurried off 
to hotel room or airport, seemed 
to me a man scattering seeds not 
of discontent, but of humanism. 
His songs and easy-gomg manner 
left with me a feeling for the 
importance of life as opposed to 
the brutal materialism that some 
hold as truth today.

Page 16CARNEGIE TECH TARTAN-Wednesday, October 12, 1966
Tartans Run Streak To Three
In Downing Allegheny
The Carnegie Tech Tartans rolled to their third victory without a loss last Saturday 
when they defeated the Allegheny Gators 19-6. The win was sparked by the pin-pqint 
passing of junior quarterback Tom Hubka, who completed 13 out of 19 attempts and at 
one point had connected with 11 in a row. The contest was the hardest fought battle 
to date, as indicated by the great amounts ofyardage both teams lost through penalties. 
The Tartans were penalized for 51 yards while the Gators lost 98 yards to the officials.
After a scoreless first quarter, 
the Tartans drew first blood by 
marching 75 yards for a touch
down. It appeared at first that 
this drive would fold when the 
Tartans were forced to punt 
from their own territory in a 
4th down and long yardage sit
uation. But, after Dave Gilchrist 
got the punt off, he was hit by a 
Gator defender and the Tartans 
regained the ball and a first 
down via the penalty. Then the 
Tartans went to the air and mov
ed the ball for the first scoring 
of the game.
The touchdown came on a 
second down and goal to go situ
ation on the six-yard line. Hub
ka dropped back to pass and 
caught Dick Bell slanting over in
to center into the end zone. When 
Joe Chernay added the extra 
point, the Tartans led 7-0.
After the Gators were unable 
to move the ball, Tech took
over after the punt on their own 
35-yard line and started the sec
ond scoring drive. Throwing 
three passes in a row, Hubka 
picked up 48 yards and, on a 
first and goal from the six, Hub
ka looked for a receiver in the 
end zone but couldnt find one, so 
he elected to rim and picked up 
the TD. Chemay's kick was 
blocked and the score stood at 
13-0 at the half.
The Gators got into the scor
ing column in the 3rd quarter 
after Pete Blaufarb, a defensive 
end, blocked Dave Gilchrists 
punt and Allegheny took posession of the ball on the Tech 
43. Freshman quarterback Mike 
Ganey fired a 37-yard pass to 
Dave Boughton, moving the Ga
tors to the Tech five, and then 
ran the ball into the end zone 
for the score. The kick was wide 
and the Tartans had their lead 
cut to seven.
The Tartans were unable to 
move the ball, and when Alle
gheny took over the ball, they 
were in grave danger of losing 
their lead. But Joe Chernay took 
the would-be comeback away 
from the Gators when he inter
cepted a Ganey pass in the end 
zone.
Tech put the icing on the cake 
when they scored their 3rd TD 
in the 4th quarter. The key play 
in the scoring drive came when 
Charley Zek powered his way 
through the Gator defense for a 
gain of 49 yards, giving the Tar
tans a first down on the Alle
gheny 12. Three plays later, 
Hubka tossed his second scor
ing pass of the day to Bell and 
the Tartans led 19-6.
At this point Tartan fans wit
nessed two of the longest min
utes they have ever seen. The 
Allegheny time clock began to do 
such interesting things as not 
running when it should and even 
running backwards at one time. 
So confused was the time situHarriers Down Both
W&J and Grove City
The Cross Country team added two victories to its rec
ord last week by whitewashing W&J 15-50 and edging 
Grove City 25-30. The W&J meet last Wednesday proved 
to be just a warmup for the tough Grove City meet. With 
Tech taking the first 8 places and having five men tie for 
first. So many of the Tech runners finished before the 5 
W&J men that the maximum score of 50 was given to
\\7 P. T
ation, in fact, that 4 plays were 
run in the last 4 seconds of 
play. But when the unofficial 
overtime was over, Tech had won 
the game and remained unde
feated on the season.
Standouts for the Tartans were 
of course Hubka, Bell, and Zak, 
but, also looking most impressive 
on both offense and defense 
were Larry Getto and Ken Batorski. On defense, the Tartans 
were outstanding in intercepting 
5 Gator passed.
This Saturday, the Tartans will 
play what could be their tough
est opponent of the season in 
Grove City at Tech Field in the 
annual Homecoming Game. The 
grovers are also undefeated on 
the season and the game will 
shape up as quite a battle.

In one of the more exciting

and GSIA F clashed in a con
test that would probably decide 
second place in the Browns

by a wide-open long-pass offense 
and very little in the way of de

passes to Wyzykowski and Havchek while Werronen hit on a

The Bandits scored quickly in 
the 3rd quarter when Havchek

excellent ball control for the rest 
of the quarter by keeping the 
ball almost the entire period and 
scoring the only other 3 points of 
the quarter on a first down and a 
safety.
The fourth quarter was almost 
a duplicate of the second, show

"C" Club To 
Award Trophy
This year during Homecoming, 
the Varsity C Club will award 
two trophies, one for the best 
Tech back and one for the best 
Tech lineman in the game. The 
panel of judges will consist of 
Mr. Haynes, Director of Athletics, 
the Tartan, and representatives 
from the Press, alumni, and the 
coaching staff. The awards will 
be presented during the dance 
Saturday night.
The Grove City team, however, 
proved to be much more of a 
challenge. The Grove City course 
is 2.05 miles long, but it must be 
covered twice. This causes dif
ficulty for runners who dont know 
the course. The course is also 
faster than the Tech course; this, 
along with the fact that co-captain 
Harry Burkholder had been sick 
for most of the week, gave the 
home team a definite advantage 
and a chance to beat Tech for 
the first time.
As most good teams, do, how
ever, the Tartans responded when 
faced with a challenge.
Bernie Flynn ran his best race 
of the year and finished only 4 
seconds slower than the GC course 
record (held by Burkholder). He 
was closely followed by GCs Art 
Ruff, who set a GC varsity rec
ord. Co-Captains Burkholder cap
tured 3 and 4 places, but the ten
sion grew as 3 more GC harriers 
crossed the finish line. When Ken 
Phillips and John Butler finished 
8th and 9th however, the race 
was over and Tech had won.
The next meet is Fri. Oct. 14 
at St. Francis. The next home 
meet is with Waynesburg, the 
major obstacle to an undefeated
season. That meetcouldbethe
best of the year.
