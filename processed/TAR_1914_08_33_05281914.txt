SCHOOL PICNIC

HaVI IMJOYaBLI oIMI.
The annual picnic, in which over 
600 students and members of the fac
ulty participated, was held Wednes
day, May 20, at Camp Louise Car
negie. Shortly before 2 oclock on 
Wednesday afternoon, the members, 
attired in their holiday costumes, as
sembled at the Shadyside station of 
the Pennsylvania Railroad. A special 
train, leaving promptly at 2 oclock, 
conveyed them to the Camp.
Upon arrival, all assembled and a 
panoramic picture was taken. Im
mediately after this, everybody set 
out to enjoy themselves in a great 
many different ways. Small groups 
proceeded to the river to enjoy canoe
ing; others wandered through the 
woods and over the nearby hills; 
others danced, while still others en
gaged in athletic stunts.
A feature of the fun at the Camp 
was a burlesque base ball game be
tween boys and girls of the school. 
The boys dressed in skirts in order 
that they should not have an advan
tage over the girls in that respect. 
Miss Ride, pitcher, and Miss Smith, 
The battery for the girls team was 
catcher, while, for the boys, Hines 
pitched and Fry was on the receiving 
end. Miss Elizabeth Stoner umpired 
the game. The result was 3-2 in fa
vor of the girls.
The Tech band furnished music 
during the entire afternoon, to which 
a great many of the students danced.
About 6 oclock the frolicers en
joyed a basket lunch, out under the 
trees. The novelty of this appealed 
to everybody and was greatly en
joyed by all.
A circus performance, under the di
rection of the Director, A. A. Hammerschlag, occupied the attention of 
all, after the lunch. He was ably as
sisted by Mr. Tarbell, registrar; 
Mr. W. P. Field, secretary, and J. H. 
McCulloch. Wm. Dorsey acted in the 
capacity of ringmaster and the unique 
way in which he announced each 
event afforded great amusement to all 
tve onlookers. J. Madison and J. 
Cameron furnished music. The usual 
crcns stunts were cleverly performed 
by Doctor Marks, F. Eyman, Vierheller, Kuh, Balsinger, Savage, Southwell and J. H. McCulloch, and were 
well received by a very appreciative 
audience.

(ARNEIE IS THIRD IN INTER (OLLEGIAIES staufINALLY DEFEATEDItAStLTOil IS SEVERELY INJURED
Penn State easily won the inter
collegiate track championship of this 
district last Saturday afternoon in the 
meet at Schenley oval, held under 
Pitts auspices. State men placed in 
every event and amassed a total of 
91 5-6 points against 63 1-3 for Pitt, 
who was second, and 30 5-6 for Car
negie who finished third.
Techs showing was fair, but it oc
casioned little comment, favorable or 
unfavorable, in view of the unfortu
nate accident that occurred to our 
star, Haselton, probably the best run
ner that has ever represented the 
Plaid. After setting a new intercol
legiate mark of 4:31 for the one-mile 
run, bettering the former record by 
six seconds, Haselton continued to 
jog around the track to regain his 
breath. Accompanied by a friend, he 
re-entered the inside of the oval, un
knowingly in the part of the field 
where the hammer throwing contest 
was about to be held. One of the 
entrants had just taken a trial throw, 
sending the missile, unintentionally, 
of course, in Haseltons direction. The 
latter did not see it until it was near
ly upon him. He tried to jump out 
of the way, but he was too late, and 
the hammer struck him about three 
inches above the knee, inflicting a 
very severe and painful injury. Dr. 
Marks was on the track at the time 
and dressed the wound so that his 
patient might be removed to the hos
pital. It has since been learned the 
injury was not as serious as it was 
first thought to be. A simple frac
ture was sustained and the muscles 
were badly bruised. The latest re
port indicated that Haselton was get
ting along nicely, although he will 
be confined to his bed for six or eight 
weeks. He certainly has the well 
wishes of the entire student body for 
a complete recovery. The accident 
happened after the third event, and 
besides depriving us of our surest 
point winner, unnerved the entire 
team.
The features of the meet were the 
breaking of nine intercollegiate rec
ords in the mile, two mile and half 
mile runs, the one mile relay race, 
the low hurdles the pole vault, the 
discus throw, and the broad and high 
jumps. The mile record, as already 
stated, was lowered by Haselton of 
Tech. Floto of W. and J., ran the 
half mile in exactly two minutes, clipp:'ng 2-5 of a second from the former
mark. Penn States star hurdler, 
Hammitt, bettered Guy Halfertys 
time made in 1909, in the low hurdles, 
by 4-5 of a second, winning easily in 
25 seconds flat. He also would have 
lowered the high hurdle mark had he 
not knocked over the final obstacle. 
States Captain and eastern intercol
legiate point winner, lowered his own 
mark 11 seconds in the two mile 
event by running the distance in 
10:02 4-5. States team of quarter 
milers set a new record for the one 
mile relay race of 3:27. beating Pitts 
1912 time of 3:30 3-5. Another State 
man to break a record was Palmer, 
who attained 22.44 feet in the broad 
jump. Alleghenys Captain, Dotterer, 
hurled the discus 127.33 feet, a dis
tance which will likely stand for sev
eral years. Pitt was credited with a 
record holder when McMasters vault
ed 11 feet, 6 inches. Wright of Tech, 
who was tied for second at 11 feet,
3 inches, established a new height 
for Carnegie in this event. King 
broke the record in the high jump for 
Pitt meets with a leap of 5 feet, 8 1-2 
inches, but his school mark is 1-4 
inch better. He could have gone 
higher if pushed.
Lamb, the husky State athlete, was 
the individual point winner. He won 
a first, a second, a third, and a tie 
for fifth place, amounting in all to 
12 1-3 points, 1-6 of a point less than 
the number earned by the entire W. 
and J. team. Dotterer of Allegheny, 
was second with 10 points and was 
the only contestant to obtain two 
firsts. McMasters of Pitt, scored 9 
counts while a few men made 8. For 
Tech, Hemman won the 100-yard 
dash and placed fourth in the 220- 
yard sprint. His time for the former 
was 1-5 of a second slower than that 
made against Pitt the week before, 
but it was fast enough to beat the 
other runners. Capt. Clair came with
in an inch of equalling our school 
record of 128 feet, 4 inches in the 
hammer throw when he took third 
in that event. Campbell finished 
fourth in the two mile run. He is a 
Plebe, and from the splendid showing 
made against the best long distance 
men of this part of the state, he 
should develop into a winner with a 
little more coaching. Dunseith ran 
another good race in the quarter mile. 
He was bunched with the leaders, seContinued on Page 8

A week ago today the Carnegie 
baseball nine accomplished a feat that 
no other Tech athletic team has been 
able to perform, namely, to defeat 
Penn State. The games between the 
same schools in the two previous 
years have been very close, but it re
mained for 1914 to witness the turn
ing of the result in favor of the Plaid.
The Carnegie team played real 
baseball all the time. Ryan pitched 
a splendid game. He was found for 
nine hits, but he kept them so well 
scattered that only in two innings 
did his opponents make more than 
one hit, and in both of those they 
made just two. With State men on 
bases, Ryan either steadied himself 
or his fielders came to his rescue. In 
the fifth inning, the visitors had run
ners on first and second and none 
were out, but they failed to score. 
Brine especially played well in the 
field. He had four difficult chances, 
every one of which he readily accept
ed. Humphries had a busy day at the 
initial sack, getting fourteen putouts.
Capt. DeMuth was the batting star 
making a double, a single, and a sac
rifice out of four times at bat. His 
two hits were directly responsible for 
three of our runs. Brine also reached 
Liebert for a double and single, driv
ing in one run and scoring another 
himself. As a team, State outhit 
Tech, but in no other manner did they 
outplay us. Their pitcher, Liebert, 
was in good form, striking out ten 
men, but his delivery was solved at 
opportune times when hits meant 
runs. Ryan allowed two more hits
than his opponent. A two-bagger by 
Bachman in the seventh inning was 
the only extra base clout made by a 
Blue and White player. A moment 
later the State second baseman dart
ed for third after De Muth caught 
Elliffes fly. As he slid into the bag, 
his foot bent under him, breaking his 
ankle. This was Bachmans first
game of the season and he was ex
tremely unfortunate in having his 
short career terminated in such a 
painful way. He was replaced by
Tobin.
The throwing arms of both catch
ers were in excellent working order 
with the result that but one stolen 
base was recorded against each.
State started the scoring in the first

.IPLOMaCY.
We have been told so often that the 
stand of The Tartan on certain ques
tions was right, but that it might have 
been expressed more diplomatically, 
that we sometimes have wondered 
whether diplomacy, as it is under
stood by college students, is not an 
admirable quality. So we have tried 
to find out just what the objectors 
meant by diplomacy.
From all such men it seems that 
their definition of this quality is the 
ability to tell a man a hard truth in 
such a way that he will not mind it, 
or in other words, to tell him hi er
rors without letting him know that 
he is being told. To us this seems a 
difficult task; to others, however, it 
is apparently quite easy.
We do not believe that it is the 
duty of a college paper to be diplo
matic. Quite the contrary. If there 
is an evil to be remedied, we want it 
remedied, and we are not afraid to 
say so. Of course, certain people 
will feel injured, but that is their mis
fortune. The interests of the entire 
student body cannot be sacrificed to 
keep a single individual or group of 
individuals in a pleased state of mind. 
We might easily go through a school 
year without criticizing anything or 
anybody, but if we did so, we would 
feel ourselves traitors to the trust 
that is placed in this paper by the stu
dent body. Only frankness pays. We 
can only hope that it will always be 
the policy of The Tartan, as it has 
been this year, to say unfearingly and 
unhedgingly just what needs to be 
said.
We are not the only school in the 
country where the Freshmen cause 
trouble. At Pennsylvania there has 
been considerable comment lately on 
the laxity of enforcement of the rules 
governing the ireshmen, and in view 
of our own experience this year and 
with the hope that conditions may be 
greatly improved next year, we are 
printing one of the articles which ap
peared in The Pennsylvanian on the 
subject.
Three years ago hazing at the Uni
versity was abolished, but it was de
cided to retain some of the traditions 
of Pennsylvania, such as wearing 
Freshman caps, not entering the 
front door of College Hall, etc. The 
purpose of continuing these customs 
was to counteract the decrease in 
class spirit that was bound to follow 
the abolition of hazing.
A Freshman Regulations Commit
tee was appointed from among the 
three upper classes to enforce these 
rules. How far they have succeeded 
it is not difficult to decide. There 
was no possible way that they could 
succeed. Freshmen were told that 
they would be brought before the 
committee if they did not follow the 
regulations.
As far as is generally known, not a 
single case has ever been brought up. 
It would have been useless, because 
the committee couldnt punish offend
ers, anyway. Even if they could have 
done anything, is it expected that the 
members of the other three classes 
should find out the name of an offend
ing Freshman (quite a task in itself) 
and then notify the committee? 
Theres too much ied tape to that. 
Its hardly to be wondered at that the 
committee had no cases.
Such a state of affairs could have 
only one result. Not only flagrant 
violation of every Freshman regula
tion has resulted, but absolute disre
gard for the rights of upperclassmen, 
as well. The Freshmen did not burn 
their caps last Thursday night be
cause the majority of them never had 
any. Of the remainder, about ninetenths mislaid theirs months ago 
when they found out that Freshman 
regulations meant to do anything one 
pleased. Freshmen dont use the front 
door of College HallIf it isnt the 
most convenient.
Why is it that when the student 
cheering section sings Hail Penn
sylvania, The Red and Blue or any 
other song, every stanza after the 
first is nothing more than a mumble, 
so that the volume with which the 
chorus is sung forms a decided con
trast? The reason is that the incom
ing classes never had to learn the 
songs, and never will learn them, ex
cept for what they can pick up hear
ing them. Freshmen do not give way 
to upperclassmen on the walks.
These things in themselves may not 
be so important, but the general atti
tude they represent is most important. 
They are a positive sign of the de
cadence of class, and with it, Univer
sity spirit.
There is only one apparent remedy. 
Hazing, in a modified form, must be
reintroduced. The three upper classes 
must be the Freshman Regulations 
Committee. They all must have the 
power to remove a pipe from a I* reshmans mouth, to send him home when 
he carries a cane, to cause him to 
take off the black eyeglasses cord a 
half-inch thick from his quarter-inch 
silver-rimmed eyeglassesor duck 
him in the frog pond. The first year 
man without his Fresh cap should 
be ducked until he wears one. If, 
however, a Freshman lived up to the 
regulations, he should be let alone.
Let the three upper classes be the 
Freshman Regulations Committee; 
not to make babies of the Freshmen, 
but men; men who will go out for 
the teams, who will go to the games, 
who will not throw newspapers on a 
running track just previous to a 
worlds championship race; who will 
cheer for Pennsylvania at the right 
time; who will know the songs and 
sing them; who will be an honor to 
Pennsylvania. The University of 
Pennsylvania does not want molly
coddles, who dont see why they 
should wear a little black cap, it wants 
men.
It would seem from the above that 
at Pennsylvania, the trouble has been 
that hazing was abolished and the 
upper classes had no way to punish 
offenders. Here we have never had 
any real college hazing, nor would we 
like to see it appear as it is carried 
on in some universities; nevertheless, 
with the blanket we always have a 
means at hand for preserving the tra
ditions of the school and for instill
ing them into the hearts of the youths 
who come to Carnegie. Our advice 
for next year would be to start early 
on the new men, and see that they 
acquire a proper respect for all school 
traditions and a wholesome fear of 
punishment in case any of these tra
ditions are violated.

The Carnegie Hero Fund Commis
sion has just issued a report in book 
form. This covers the entire history 
of its foundation and labors and all 
the cases that it has acted upon fa
vorably since its organization, Janu
ary 31, 1905, to January 31, 1914. A 
very remarkable showing of the work, 
that it has accomplished, is made.
During the nine years of its exist
ence, it has considered over 12,000 
cases, in which heroism was reported 
in the saving of human life. It has 
granted awards in 871 of these cases. 
The awards consist of 16 gold med
als, 330 silver medals, and 525 bronze. 
Pecuniary awards for various pur
poses such as pensions, assistance in 
great distress, and other worthy 
causes, having totaled over $1,225,000. 
Among these latter was an appropria
tion of $200,000 for the use of the Car

applied for the equipment and main
tenance of the school of Apprentices 
and Journeymen, now the school of 
Applied Industries, and the Margaret

ing. Assessment, $1.00 per couple. 
The honor guest and Commence
ment speaker this year will be Frank 
A. Vanderlip, LL.D., president of the 
National City Bank of New York, and 
former assistant secretary of the 
United States Treasury. Mrs. Vanderlip, who will accompany her hus
band, will be entertained by the Mar
garet Morrison Carnegie School.
Arrangements for a new type of a 
Class Day, one in which the four 
schools will participate, are being 
made by the Class Day Committee. 
The program, as now planned, will in
clude performances by two of the 
schools in the afternoon, and two in 
the evening, to be given on Tech 
Field. The Campus will be decorated 
and illuminated, and benches will be 
provided. A professional band will 
play on the Campus at intervals 
throughout the afternoon and even
ing, and it is hoped that the Musical 
Clubs and the Choral Club will fur
nish a short contribution to the sched
ule by giving two or three numbers 
each at a stated time and place.
The above program will run ap
proximately from 3:30 to 10:00 p. m., 
and it is earnestly hoped that the 
guests of the day, the faculty and stu
dents, will remain on the grounds 
throughout the afternoon and even
ing. The Class Day Committee will 
arrange for box lunches at a moderate 
price for those who do not come pro
vided with their own lunches, and an 
ice cream booth with tables will also 
be provided.
In addition to the above arrange
ments, it has been suggested that some 
of the senior clubs, fraternities, so
cieties, or other groups of students, 
might-wish to start this year the usual 
college custom on class day of giv
ing spreads to their own invited 
guests. The Institute has placed at 
the disposal of the Class Day Com
mittee as many different rooms in the 
different buildings as may be needed 
for this purpose, if any of the above 
organizations decide to spread, and 
wish to use one or more rooms on
the campus instead of their houses at 
a distance.
Class Day tickets will be available 
for distribution later, three to be is
sued to each undergraduate, without 
expense, and 20 to each senior.
The Commencement Ball Commit
tee has voted that this event be in
formal, that the assessment be fixed 
at $1.00 per couple, and recommends 
that the dress for the occasion be 
summer gowns for the girls, and white 
trousers and dark coats for the men.

The Seniors of M. M. C. S. while 
entering heartily into the plans for 
the uniting of the commencement fes
tivities of the schools, are planning to 
have a few final celebrations all their 
own. They are planning to present 
the play, Comus, in which every 
member of the graduating class will 
participate.
The Seniors are also planning a 
Senior dance, to be held in the school 
gymnasium.

The Senior English of the M. M. 
C. S. under the able supervision of 
Miss Perry, are publishing a new 
school paper, to be known as the 
Shilling, as it will cost a quarter. 
It will be published quarterly. It will 
contain all the school news of all the 
classes and night school, and it is 
hoped by its advocates to become one 
of the strong and powerful influences 
around all the four schools.
This new magazine is being printed 
by the classes in that subject at In
dustries.

The keynote to Carnegies victor
ies on the diamond this year is a sim
ple four lettered word, R-y-a-n. More 
than that, these same members of the 
alphabet spell the name of the per
son who is keeping Tech on the map 
of collegiate base ball. If all our 
games were scheduled at long enough 
intervals, we should probably have 
a perfect record for the season. Un
fortunately such a plan could not be 
carried out and the result is disas
trous. These remarks do not give 
one man too much credit. There are 
eight other players on the team, but 
they give a different exhibition when 
Ryan is pitching than when some one 
else is in the box. To aid in an ex
planation of this phenomenon, we 
humbly beg to suggest that Prof. 
Munsterberg be consulted. The ques
tion seems to be entirely a psycho
logical one.
In the meantime, the schedule will 
be continued with great hope. Sat
urday, Decoration Day, the Varsity 
will meet Bethany on Tech Field at
3 oclock and next Tuesday, the re
turn engagement with Allegheny will 
be played on the same grounds at 3:30 
oclock. If Tech can only display the 
form they showed against Penn State,
there can be no doubt as to the out
come of these contests.

The 1914 track season for Carnegie 
will come to a close Saturday, with 
the intercollegiate meet at New Wil
mington, Pa., under the management 
of Westminster College. Pitt will be 
Techs hardest opponent, although 
several other colleges will compete. 
Were it not for the loss of Haselton 
our chances for victory would be ex
ceedingly bright. Under the present 
circumstances the outlook is not so 
cheerful, but nevertheless, first place 
is not an impossibility. Haseltons 
two events would probably have been 
half-mile and two-mile. In the first 
named McMilan defeated the Pitt 
runners in the dual meet two weeks 
ago; while in the second Grumbling, 
of the Blue and Gold, is likely to fin
ish ahead of Campbell, who seems as
sured of second place however. If 
the other schools can take enough 
points from our closest rivals, we 
may still be able to repeat last years 
performance and end the season vic
toriously.

Director A. A. Hamerschlag has 
just received a copy of The Empire 
of Business, by Andrew Carnegie, 
from which the following excerpt has 
been taken:
The value of the education which 
young men can now receive cannot be 
over-estimated, and it is to this edu
cation, as given in technical schools, 
to which I wish to call your atten
tion. Time was when men had so lit
tle knowledge that it was easy for 
one man to embrace it all, and the 
courses in colleges bear painful evi
dence of this fact today. Knowledge 
is now so various, so extensive, so 
minute, that it is impossible for any 
man to know thoroughly more than 
one small branch. This is the age of 
the specialist; therefore, you who 
have to make your living in this world 
should resolve to know the art which 
gives you support; to know that thor
oughly and well, to be an expert in 
your specialty. If you are a mechanic, 
then from this library study every 
work bearing upon the subject of me
chanics. If you are a chemist, then 
every work bearing upon chemistry. 
If you are at the blast furnaces, then 
every work upon the blast furnace. If 
in the mines, then every work upon 
mining. Let no man know more of 
your specialty than you do yourself. 
That should be your ideal. Then, far 
less important, but still important, to 
bring sweetness and light into your 
life, be sure to read promiscuously, 
and know a little about as many things 
as you have time to read about. Just 
as on his farm the farmer must first 
attend well to his potatoes and his 
corn and his wheat, from which he 
derives his revenue, and he may spend 
his spare hours as a labor of love in 
cultivating the flowers that surround 
his home. One domain your work, 
and the other your recreation.
In these days of transition and of 
struggles between labor and capital, 
to no better purpose can you devote
a few of your spare hours than to the 
study of economic questions. There 
are certain great laws which will be 
obeyed; the law of supply and de
mand, the law of competition; the law 
of wages and of profits. All these 
you will find laid down in the text
books, and remember that there is no 
more possibility of defeating the op
eration of these laws than there is 
of thwarting the laws of nature which 
determine the humidity of the atmos
phere or the revolution of the earth 
upon its axis.
The severe study of scientific 
books must not be permitted to ex
clude the equally important duty of 
reading the masters in literature; and 
by all means of fiction. The feeling 
which prevails in some quarters 
against fiction is, in my opinion, only 
a prejudice. I know that some, in
deed most, of the most eminent men, 
find in a good work of fiction one of 
the best means of enjoyment and of 
rest. When exhausted in mind and 
body, and especially in mind, nothing 
is so beneficial to them as to read 
a good novel. It is no disparagement 
of free libraries that most of the 
works read are works of fiction. On 
the contrary, it is doubtful if any other 
form of literature would so well serve 
the important end of lifting hard
working men out of the prosaic and 
routine duties of life. The works of 
Scott, Thackeray, Eliot, Dickens, 
Hawthorne, and others of the same 
class, are not to be rated below any 
other form of literature for working
men.

in Pittsburgh about 9:30 P. M.
The picnic was a great success and 
Director Hammerschlag is deserving

Carnegie won the tennis match 
which was played last Monday with 
Geneva, on the University Club 
courts. Geneva had but three men 
here so that one singles and one dou
bles match were defaulted to Tech. 
Captain Douthet lost his match with 
Dodds after a hard fight lasting for 
three sets. Savage had a little trou
ble in winning from Ransom, but 
kept within two sets. Beeken cap
tured his match with Johnson and 
will receive his letter for so doing. 
In the doubles Douthet and Savage 
failed to win a set from Ransom and 
Dodds. The scores were: In singles,
Savage won from Ransom', 6-4, 6-3; 
Douthet lost to Dodds, 2-6, 6-2, 2-6; 
Beeken won from Johnson, 75, 6-1. 
In doubles: Savage and Douthet lost

The fifth week of the Aborn Eng
lish Grand Opera Companys remark
able run at the Alvin Theatre, Pitts
burgh, starting next Monday night, 
June 1st, will bring the first offer
ing from the pen of Giacomo Puccini 
to the Aborn repertory, Madam But
terfly, being scheduled for the usual 
eight performances, including Wed
nesday and Saturday matinees, and 
two special matinees Thursday and 
Friday of Humperdincks Hansel and 
Gretel.
Puccini, through his numerous 
compositions, all brought forth within 
a comparatively few years, has per
formed the feat of winning both, the 
high esteem of the critical, and the 
the favor of the great mass of un
schooled music lovers, and is prob
ably as great a favorite as any com
poser of past or present times with 
opera goers of all classes.
Madam Butterfly, one of his latest 
works, produced for the first time 
in 1904, is generally considered his 
masterpiece.

The mountain air of West Virginia 
was too much for the Carnegie ball 
team last week. Both games went to 
W. Va. Wesleyan, without any vis
ible signs of life from the Tech tossers. Wesleyan won because they were 
just a little bit less slow than Tech. 
The scores were 10-3 and 12-5. Lain 
stirred up quite some dust when he 
stole home in the ninth in the first 
game. Some of the players didn't 
think he meant it when he started on 
the long roll from third to home, but 
they took it all back when he kept 
on going and scored Techs third and 
last run in the game. Kreider and 
Oeffinger made the other two runs. 
Kreider was first man up and singled. 
Oeffinger sacrificed; Brine flied out 
and De Muth singled, sending Krei
der home. Oeffingers tally was 
made in the sixth when he singled 
and scored on Brines long drive to 
middle.
Wesleyan did not score until the 
second inning, and then they gam
boled around the bases for five runs. 
Urquhart then received a little bet
ter support and held them down to 
one more run, which came in the 
fifth. Fry then took the box. Wes
leyan scored four more runs and left 
the field very well satisfied with the 
afternoons romp.

The second game was no faster 
than the first. Brine scored two runs,

DeMuth and Humphries also scored 
in the ninth, and Fry, who was play
ing third, scored in the eighth. Ryan 
pitched but did not have the usual 
amount of stuff on the ball He has 
pitched in all but one game this sea

then in the second drove the ball far 
over McDonalds head, which could 
just be seen over the edge of the hill 
in center field, for a home run. Four 
more runs were made in the second 
inning. Wesleyan had another batting

other home run out to center field, 
and three other men scored

oeam by the Vcore, 4-0.
In a well played game, the Plebe 
base ball team, under the manager
ship of Darwin A. Antes, won their 
second match of the season. Their 
opponents were the Peabody High 
School boys, who enjoy a very envi
able record in the Interscholastic 
League. The game was played at the 
Peabody grounds in Morningside, be
fore a small but very enthusiastic aud
ience. The Plebes clearly demon
strated their superiority in every part 
of the game, and for that reason,
should be ranked as one of the best 
Freshman College teams in Western 
Pennsylvania.
In the opening inning, the Plebes 
secured one run. Kesner, the second 
man up, lined out a beautiful single, 
stole second and came home on Mar
shalls long two-bagger into right
field. They scored another in the
fourth. Doherty, the first man to bat 
in this inning, met one of Milligans 
speed balls squarely for a two bag
ger. Addison sacrificed him to third 
and he scored on G. Jacobsons Texas 
leaguer to right field. Two more runs 
were added in the sixth. Kesner got 
a walk. Addison knocked out a two 
bagger and both scored on L. Jacob
sons hit to left field.
The Peabddy lads were very weak 
at bat, only getting two hits in the 
entire game. This was undoubtedly 
due to the superb pitching of both 
Darlington and L. Jacobson. Only 
one Peabody man reached third base.
Manager Curtis feels very well sat
isfied with the showing of his team. 
He has arranged a fine schedule for 
the remainder of the season. The 
Freshman teams of Pitt, State, Alle
gheny and several other of the nearby
colleges are includedonth<: list.

The tennis team opened the sea
son Friday by going down to defeat 
before the team from Penn State, six 
matches to none. The matches were 
played on the courts of the University 
Club and, considering that it was our 
first match, oufrteam played very 
good tennis. The State team is ex
ceptionally strong this year, being 
composed of three veterans and a bril
liant young Freshman named McCance, a star from Edgewood.
The playing of Capt. Douthett was 
excellent, in fact it was the best ten
nis any man has played for Tech in 
three years. The other men did not 
play up to standard, but showed that 
when going right Tech will be rep
resented by a very good team.
The scores follow:

We have classified our advertisers so that our readers may use the list 
for reference before making purchases. The grouping furnishes an excellent 
variety of merchants for any article which a student, alumnus or faculty 
member would be likely to buy, and there is no valid reason of which we are 
aware that would justify anyone interested in the welfare of The Tartan in 
making purchases from any but merchants who so kindly make such a publi
cation possible. Be sure, also, to give one of the purchase stubs, which you 
will find enclosed in your Tartan every other week, to the clerk from whom1 
you make the purchase. The stubs, we have found, make pleased advertisers 
and help to get new ones. May we depend upon YOU to take this as a re
