At Little Washington on Saturday, October 14, Carnegie Tech will pit 
its strength against its old rival, W. & J., in a game that ranks second to 
none on our schedule. The Presidents walked over us to the tune of 14-0 
last year and are fervently hoping to repeat the procedure although even 
they are not very confident of success.
In 1921 W. & J. added the scalps" 
of Bethany, Bucknell, Lehigh, Syra
cuse, West Virginia Wesleyan, West
minister, Pitt, West Virginia and De
troit to their collections besides hold
ing California to a scoreless tie.
This year W. & J. has already 
conquered the Geneva and Bethany 
gridders and is now looking at us 
with doubtful anticipation. It is up 
to Carnegie to stop1 their rush and 
we can do it, bujt the team} needs 
support
The realization that their school is 
supporting them means half the game, 
to a team and the best way to sup
port Carnegie Tech is to be at Little 
Washington Saturday p. m. The 
price is within the reach, of all - so 
that no Carnegie student, who asserts 
his loyalty) to the school, can afford 
to miss the game. On to Little Wash
ington!
Saturday at 11:30' a. m., all the 
rooters are to gather at the Forbes 
street side of the Court House from 
where they will pee-rade through 
town to the1 Pennsylvania Station.
The train leaves at 12:15 and will 
reach Little Washington at 1:30, 
when the pee-rade shall continue to 
the field.
Tickets for the game must be se
cured at Frank Haarens office and 
railroad tickets at the. station. Tick
ets. for the game are $.75 and may 
only be secured upon presentation of 
registration card.
Further details will be given out 
in General Assembly today and every
one should be present to get the 
final dope, while we adopt as our 
slogan
On to Little Washington!

The health of the student body so 
far this year has been very satisfac
tory; a few colds here and there be
ing the only sickness reported. How
ever, since in all probability, we will 
have a very hard winter, Dr. Esquerre 
advises all the students to be very 
careful of their living conditions. He 
advises three meals a day, lots of 
drinking water, at least one hour of 
exercise a day, and from seven to 
eight hours sleep in order to keep the 
resistance of the body at par.
Mid-West Holds Luncheon
The Mid West Club held their first 
luncheon at the Schenley Hotel grill 
room, Saturday, October seventh, at 
* one oclock. About twenty members 
were present, including faculty mem
bers, Kennedy, Huus, and Swanson, 
and Dean Morris.
H. C. Bamberger, first president and 
an original booster of the club ex
plained the purpose of the club. The 
Association was formed, primarily to 
help the new men at Carnegie, from 
the West and Middle West, to become 
at home here and thus to help allay 
that homesickness that nearly all ex
perience upon their advent into a 
college life. The club also aims to 
 keep the alumni of the West in touch 
with each other and their Alma Mater.
iDean Morris gave a very interesting 
talk for which the new men were es
pecially grateful as they heartily and 
sincerely were made to feel welcome 
at Carnegie.
After expressing the aims, hopes 
and the future of the club, President 
Olson brought up the question of an

The General Assembly today is to 
be a big* pep session in preparation 
for the W. & J. game next Saturday. 
There will be a lot of Dractice cheer
ing and singing, and possibly some 
dope spilled on the outcome of the 
game. The cheering so far this year 
lias been rotten, because the student 
body has not 'been behind it. We 
must not go down to Washington next 
(Saturday and make a poor showing. 
It meand too much to the team and 
to Carnegie Techs rooting reputation.
The student body headed by the 
band will form in front of the Cen
tral Building and parade down to the 
Music Hall. Everyone should be out 
and join in the parade so that a good 
start will be made. There is a lot of 
psychology in a good start. At the 
Music Hall the band jvlll play two 
selections and the new Carnegie Tech 
song Fight for the, glory of Carnegie, 
written by Bob Sclimertz. The cheer 
leaders want to work this song up in 
good shape so that It can he used 
Saturday.
Wally Steffen Is to .speak, and will 
probably tell us what chances wo 
have of winning from W. & J. Those 
who heard him last year before the 
game will remember what a fine heart 
to heart talk he gave us. Graduate 
Manager Iiaaren will explain about 
the transportation to Washington Sat
urday. They are expecting to secure 
accommodations for several thousand 
rooters.
For entertainment, there will be 
two acts. Obie Newman and Ross

Drama Department, will stage one act 
and Newman, Hertz, and Snyder will 
put on the other. There is really no

Mining Engineering Dept. 
Holds Get-Together Smoker
Oil last Thursday evening, the Min
ing Department held their first 
smoker of the year at I he Bureau of 
Mines. Its main purpose was for the 
mining engineers, coal minors and the 
research men to get acquainted with 
each other, with the Dejyartmenl. Fac
ulty and with the Advisory Board of 
the Co-operating Mining Department.
(Chairman Jeffers, a senior miner, 
presided over the meeting. He out
lined the fact that there would be 
two more smokersithis school year, one 
In mid-semester and one in the spring, 
which will be a farewell to the seniors. 
He also mentioned the fact that this 
department was the first one to get 
together this year.
The first speaker of the evening was 
W. E. Fohl, a consulting mining en
gineer of this city, who spoke main
ly on the subject of adjustments in 
the coal industry. He thoroughly cov
ered the disputes existing between the 
operators and the employes and sure
ly everyone present had many differ
ent ideas than they had before.
The next speaker was W. L. Affelder, chairman of the Advisory Board, 
assistant to the president of the Hill
man Coal and / Coke Company. He 
gave an illustrated lecture of a Trip 
Through the Coal Mines. His slides 
were largely taken in Pennsylvania 
and West Virginia and they were of 
tipples, welfare work, and in general 
examples of mining machinery.
After this illustrated lecture, every
one removed themselves to the third 
floor where everyone ate sandwiches . 
and coffee.
The guests were Director Mott and 
the Department Faculty.
SCIENCE FRESHMAN SMOKER
A smoker was scheduled to be held 
last Tuesday evening at four-thirty in 
Carnegie Union for the Science Fresh
men, with the intention of giving 
every one the opportunity of becom
ing acquainted with the Plebe candi
dates for office in that college.
However, when the appointed time 
arrived, the only ones who made tlieir 
appearance were the members of the 
orchestra and most of the candidates, 
with very few others. As a smoker 
the affair was a failure, but excellent 
music was furnished by the Tartan 
Entertainers ,and the Plebes spent 
some time in talking over their pros
pects for the coming year.
About five-thirty, when it was ap
parent that no one olse Intended com
ing, the meeting ended.
SCIENCE SOPHS TO HOLD
TEA DANCE FRIDAY, 4:30
Friday afternoon at 4:30 the 
Science Sophs will give a tea dance 
in the Union, and invite all students 
to attend.

ity of its social functions and will no 
doubt improve upon them this year.
THISTLE SALE 
TO CONTINUE 
UNTIL FRIDAY
Class Pictures to be Taken 
During Next Two WeeksSenior Pictures After No' 
vember 1.
The Thistle Board has been com 
pelled to extend the sale of the year 
book throughout this week, owing 
entirely to the lack or support of the 
student body. It was hoped that the 
undergraduates would respond and 
help make this year's volume better 
than any previous number. With this 
end in view, an extra, inducement 
was given by having the subscribers 
name embossed upon the book, free 
of charge. The result of last weeks 
campaign was vorv discouragiughardly two hundred copies being sold 
in all four schools.
The students Should realize that 
at least a thousand copies must be 
subscribed for and that delay upon 
the part of the utidergraduaf.es mere
ly increases the work of the* staff. 
Lets make this week a clean up!
The cost of the year book is in 
the neighborhood of $7.50. The sub
scribers pay $4.50. while the adver
tisements, fraternities, etc., make up 
the difference. Contracts must bo 
signed, a budget must be presented 
to the S. A. B.; in order to do this 
intelligently the number of sub
scriptions must be known.
Class pictures will be taken witliinin the next two weeks. Watch your 
bulletin boards (for notification of the 
day, place and hour. Everyone should 
make It a point to be 011 hand at 
the time specified. Make your class 
picture truly representative.
The pictures of the Seniors will 
probably be taken very soon, start
ing about. November 1, and continu
ing for three weeks. All students 
who arcregistered as Seniors and 
who will liavo completed tlieir course 
before June, 1923, will have tlieir pic
ture in the year book.
Seniors, help tlie Thlstlo by get
ting your subscriptions in at once!

a broad smile-a unique specimen for

The hour or Industries AsBombly

CHAPEL SERVICES
Beginning Tuesday, October 10, vol
untary chapel services will be held 
Tuesday of each week at the Carnegie 
Institute of Technology. The services, 
which will be non-sectarian, will be 
held in the Little Theater Building at 
noon, and for the first conducted un
der the supervision of the Institution, 
with assistance from the Y. M. C. A. 
branch at Carnegie Tech.
Dr. Hugh T. ICerr, of the Shady 
Presbyterian Church, conducted the 
services Tuesday. Music was fur
nished by' the Music Department of 
Carnegie. It is the intention to have 
prominent speakers, from in town and 
outside, conduct the services each 
week. These ministers will be chos
en from churches of various creeds, 
in proportion to the number of stu
dents making up that particular sect 
in Carnegie Tech. In all probability 
Dr. F. G. Budlong of the Ascension 
Episcopal Church, will conduct' the 
chapel for the third week. The min
ister for the second week has not as 
yet been named.
Last year, a series of chapel meet
ings was held under the auspices of 
the Carnegie Tech Branch of the Y. 
M. C. A. and while these were unoffi
cial they were largely attended. As a 
result a meeting was hold, when repre
sentatives of Protestant, Catholic and 
Hebrew organizations were present, 
in addition to delegates from the Edu
cational Senate of the Faculty, and the 
Student Senate. A resolution was 
unanimously adopted by these various 
representatives to recommend chapel 
services, voluntary and non-sectarian 
as a regular part of the 1922-1923 
schedule.

Jack Franklin, who has made the 
arrangements for the W. & J. trip, 
reports that the Pennsylvania Rail

URGENT CALL MADE 
FOR CHEER LEADERS
Head Cheer Leader Ross 
Hertz Issues Call For 
More Assistants.
Ross Hertz issues a call Tor more 
cheer leaders. At present there are 
nine men who are working hard to put 
Carnegie Tech where it belongs in 
the cheering circle. Andrew Olson 
and Cy Pfoenniger are assistant cheer 
leaders while the following men are 
out to lead the various sections at the 
football games: Strlzzi, Gross, Bow
ers, Fencil, Wilson and Larosa. This 
number is not sufficient to lend the 
body of Carnegie supporters in cheer
ing. A call Is made to the Plebes to 
come out for the cheer leaders' class 
on Tuesday and Friday afternoons in 
the Arts Foyer at 4:30 P. M. If you 
have led cheering sections in high 
school, do your duty to your Alpia 
Mater by appearing at the above spec
ified time.
It was plainly seon in last Satur
days game that our cheering was not 
what It should liavo been. Tlio ex
treme ends of tlio student soction 
were silent during the entire period of 
cheering. They had 110 one to load 
them. When a visiting team plays 
Carnoglo, and the student supporters 
do not cheer any hotter than they 
have boon doing, the reputation of 
our spirit which tlio visitors take 
homo with them will not bo as high 
as it should. Also, tlio re was 110 reg
ular loader for the alumni section, 
This soction can make as much nolso 
as the students If they are led by 
an efficient loader. All this loads 
back to the fact that we need jnoro 
cheer leaders. Como out and give 
your-support.

Eleven crimson-clad players working with the smoothness of a welloiled machine sent the Geneva gridders back home last Saturday with a 
decisive defeat chalked against them. The Tartan warriors repeatedly pene
trated the defense of the Covenanters until with the blowing of the final 
whistle the score stood at 27-0. Nevertheless, this does not mean that the 
game was not replete with thrills, for time and again the buff-clad men of 
Genova opened up a dazzling offensive that 011 one or two occasions threat
ened the Plaid goal line.
With the opening kickoff, the Slcibos began a determined march down 
the field and after nine plays, Jimmie 
Robertson slipped across the goal line 
for the first touchdown. Cy Comfort 
failed to annex the extra point by a 
goal from placement. Again the Tar

field, but 011 the Genova :!0-yard line 
Brumbaugh fumbled and Lynch scoop
ed up the ball. With a clear field I10 
negotiated the (10 yards Tor Gouevas

The remaining two touchdowns came 
In the second and third quarters with 
Brummy carrying the ball across. 
On ono of those lie dodged several 
tacklers and finally completed tlio 
nine yards In a flying somersault over 
tlio line.
Wilde was the outstanding' star for 
Genova. Noar tho end of tlio third 
quarter he broke through tho lino for 
a run of 1() yards before being brought 
down by Szold on tho Tartan 20-yard

BUY YOUR THISTLE NOW
The Thistle sales campaign is now on and anyone who wants a 
year book should place the order immediately ; it will help the board 
"to estimate the number oi! copies needed, and thereby put out the 
record more efficiently; also insure that all can be supplied. It can 
not be expected that last minute orders are going to be filled, because 
there is no,way oJ: telling how many to print.
ON CARNEGIE TO W. & J.
All Carnegie should be at the W. & J. game on Saturday, to 
cheer the tenni to victory. Few people realize what a strenuous 
campaign the football men must go through in preparation for a big 
game; or how hard the actual contest is'for the participants; or how 
hard tho coaches must work to get the team in shape. All this physi
cal and mental labor is for the glory of Carnegie, and all that the 
alumni and students are requested to do, is to support the team by 
being present at the game.
BOOST THE MUSICAL CLUBS
The Musical Clubs need men to make up the organization 
for the coining year. There has been a reorganization which will 
put nil men trying out on the same basis; that is, everybody must, try 
out for n. place in the clubs regardless of their past standing, 
which moans that Micro will be 110 partiality shown in making selec
tions. Carnegie has always had a. good program to oilier tho public; 
but oE course thero is room for improvement, and this year we will 
bo a bit better, if the students will leiid their talents.
THE COLONEL RETIRES
Colonel llroolcs is soon to leave Carnegie to retire from active 
duty, lie lias well oarlied a res I*, and a relief from responsibility 
by his service to the nation; nevertheless, we hate to see him leave, 
for-his work on tho campus Inis boon very valuable; however, tho 
jiiduenee ol! his personality will remain for a long time. All Carnegie 
unnnimonsly wish him Imppiness and success.

COMMENTS
INDUSTRIES ASSEMBLY
The new president, A1 Irwin, occu
pied the chair at Hie Industries As
sembly last. Wednesday. Irwin 
was chosen at a special election, hold 
tho last week In September, to (ill the 
vacancy caused by the resignation of 
Logan Johnson.
Because of tho fact that most of 
the officora of tho assembly liavo boon 
away from school attending the Yalo 
game, no regular program had boon 
drawn up, and after a. short business 
mooting, the assembly was turned 
over to tho Sophomores, who conduct
ed an -impromptu Plobo trial. Three 
Plebes who had broken various regu
lations wore brought up before Red 
Morris, who acted as Judge, and u 
jury of twelve Juniors and Seniors. 
All the Plebes were found guilty and 
Were given the customary paddling. 
In addition, two of tho most serious 
offenders were given sentences of spe
cial work on the campus.
Following the trial, Fisher gave a 
peppy talk, telling of the bitter dis
appointment felt by all who saw the 
Yale game, and giving his opinion of 
Carnegie Tech students, who failed to 
support such a team as represents 
them. He called for better attendance 
at the games, better cheering, and
OUTSIDE THE CLASS ROOM
A distinctly new method of practi
cal education is being worked out by 
Arthur E, Morgan famous engineer 
and president of Antioch College, Yeilow Springs, Ohio, in brief, Mr. Mor
gans plan is something like this: 
Each student alternates live weeks of 
study with IIvo weeks of work In one 
of the Industries in some nearby city. 
He does not mow lawns or perform 
janitor's duties, but each lias a job 
which carries with it considerable 
responsibility.
The members of the faculty who 
have courses in business administra
tion work the same way, dividing 
tlieir time between the chins room and 
their professions. Mr. Morgan still 
carries on bis engineering business. 
The professors thus keep in close con
tact with present day business meth
ods and are able to impart to tlieir 
pupils the benefits of practical exper
ience.
For the student, the principal object 
of the system is not to help him meet 
college expenses. Of course the 
money he earns does help defray ex
penses. But the primary purpose is 
to encourage students to get in busi
ness for themselves. Mr. Morgan be
lieves that initiative and self-rellanca 
can be developed in a man only after 
he has gone into business for him
self.
The regular class room work under 
the professor's direction has a tend
ency to make the student a mere 
order-taker When lie graduates, he 
limits for a good job where he con
tinues to take orders from his su
periors.
Training for proprietorship, accord
ing to Mr. Morgan, is an essential 
which is lacking in modern educa
tional methods.
Much might be said pro and con for 
tills system. Its advantages would be 
the greatest when a man could work 
during his five weeks at something 
which had a close relationship to his 
chosen profession. /Such a situation 
would rarely be met with. Study
ing bu.t half time, a student would re
quire twice the length of time to com
plete the requirements for graduation.
The fact remains that developing of 
self reliance is essential to a good 
education. In every college there are 
opportunities for developing leader
ship, which iii turn develops selfreliance. The managers of our var
ious activities bear a responsibility 
equal to that of a small business. 
Furthermore they run, tlio risk of 
gaining or losing, a great deal depend
ing on efficiency of management. Such 
opportunities for training should not 
be neglected by any student.

Our hat is off to Bob Schmertz's 
new song. Heard it for the first time 
at the Geneva game, and it sure is 
"tho goods. "Dear Old Tech has been 
worked to death, and with the advent 
of tho new lyric it will receive some 
needed rest. There is a wallop in the 
new song. It gets right down to the 
bottom of the Carnegie spirit and has 
a decidedly martial air. Lets work it 
up for W. & J. Maybe the tune of 
"The Kilties are coming will break

you are one of the sad minority, be

Have a letter from a person who

letter is instructive, but not exactly 
what we want.
Louise, we appreciate your interest, 
and your idea if all right, but the exe

discriminating. Were going to start 
a comic supplement soon, and maybe 
we could use you r picture then. Or you 
might save it and send it in when we 
have a contest for Queen of the Mardi

Dont go away mad, L. L. Write 
again.
What do you think of the work at 
the entrance to the cut?
Have a letter from one who thinks 
it is good. So do we.
Dear Roamer:
The new entrance to the cut is now 
beginning to assume a shape so that 
we can tell what it looks like. Pret
ty snappy entrance isnt it? Wouldn't 
it be some change if the good work 
was continued and they would pave 
the stretch between Forbes and Woodlawn? Some of the girls in Forbes 
Hall were explaining why the work
men regrade the stretch of lawn near 
the Hall every few weeks. It seems 
that the girls are in the habit of 
dumping on this lawn, the dirt and cin
ders that they find inside tlieir shoes 
after walking over the cut. With, so 
many girls following this custom it 
has become necessary to do the grad
ing at regular intervals. Why not in
vest a little in paving the walk and 
savo this expense?

Science Sophs Elect

"Fight For the Glory 
Carnegie to be Used 
Saturday.
of
Last Saturday the new football song 
was presentedand met with a very 
warm reception. This is one of the 
best songs which Carnegie has, and 
great credit and thanks are due to 
Bob Sclimertz, the author and com
poser.
Mr. Sclimertz graduated last June 
and this piece of work certainly shows 
the old Carnegie spirit from an alum
nus. The music is an entirely new 
composition with a distinctly Scottish 
air, so that it suits the need of the 
school.
The student body waits to hear from 
more of the alumni in respect to ma
terial for the much needed song book. 
Every Tartan supporter should know 
this song before next Saturdays game.

Stoddard Speaks to 
Faculty on Near East
Speaker Calls Conditions in 
East Dangerous.
The world of Islam, mentally and 
spiritually quiescent for almost a 
thousand yenrs, is once more astir, 
ohce more on the march. This was 
the way in which Lothrop Stoddard, 
famous author, lecturer, and author
ity on political science, summed up 
ihia address on The New World of 
Islam, in the Little Theater, Friday 
evening.
"The present crisis in Turkey 
grave, though it he,is but.a part of a 
larger whole. The smoke Of burning 
Smyrna and the glitter of bayonets 
along the Dardanelles must not blind 
us to the fact that Mustapha Kemal 
and his Turkish Nationalists have be
hind them the reborn world of Islam," 
said Mr. Stoddard, discussing the pres
ent crisis in the Near East.
"The great war immensely aggra
vated an already critical situation, 
Mr. Stoddard stated, "and it was sur
prising that when the Orient perceiv
ed the European peoples locked in a 
death (grip, it did not decide at that 
time to make their strike for world 
supremacy. That they refrained is 
proof of their foresight. They were 
not materially prepared, and above nil 
themoral urge was lacking. Islam's 
wisest, leaders knew that athwart the 
Suitans writ was stencilled Made 
in Germany, and they had no desire 
to pull Germanys chestnuts out of the 
lira.
According to Mr. Stoddard, the Ver
sailles peace conference at the close of 
the great war, showed Islam that the 
European powers had no intention of 
relaxing their hold upon the Near 
East. And the upshot of all this has 
been a series of revolts against Euro
pean rule, not merely among the Turk
ish and Arab populations of the form
er Ottoman Empire, but broadcast 
throughout: the Islamic world, all the 
way from Morocco to India.
Commenting upon the present up
heaval in the Near East and the rift 
between England and France, Mr. 
Stoddard said: The rift had become 
so deep that France presently began 
aiding the Turks. In fact the situa
tion in Asia Minor presently took on 
the aspect of a veiled Anglo-French 
war, with England using the Greeks 
and France the Turks as their re
spective tools. Then came the Turk
ish stroke, the Greek collap'se, and 
the present crisis, with Britain left 
alone to face the torrent of the vic
torious Turkish Nationalism. And be
hind Mustapha Kemal stands Islam.
Just before his address Mr. StodGET THE FACTS.
A school without an alumni means 
that all of its work is in the future 
there is nothing to show for past 
deeds. A school whose alumni are 
only in one locality means that that 
school has no progressivenessa 
work achieved indicates progressive
ness, and alumni achievements al
ways travel back to ones Alma 
Mater.
And so it goes, as alumni perform 
great deeds, somewhere, an Alma 
Mater is being elevated to a higher 
plane.
Carnegie Tecli alumni are scattered 
throughout the world. Everywhere 
they are advancing to the fore, and 
as they do this for themselves, like
wise they are doing it for Carnegie 
Tech.
Look where they are:

directly in proportion as the growth 
of its alumni organization.

The Banquet Rules for the Sopho
more and Freshman class, as passed 
by the Student Council last year, are 
effective this year. These rules greiw 
out of some practices that were abus
ive to the school, and inconsistent 
with, the ideals of our institution. 
Much unprofitable publicity was ten
dered us by the downtown newspa
pers, which subsequently created 
wrong impressions on the parents of 
the students.
Not only for the above reasons, but 
also to prevent the loss of valuable 
class time for' those most active in the 
preparations of the banquets, were 
the following rules passed:
1. The Banquet must be held on 
Friday or Saturday night or on a night 
preceding a holiday.
2. The Plebe Banquet shall be held 
sometime between the end of the foot
ball season (November 25) and the 
first of the second semester, (Febru
ary 3.)
3. The place of banquet and all ac
tivities having to do with the banquet 
must be confined to a radius of fif
teen (15) miles of the school.
4. No class officers shall be molest
ed in any manner that will cause him 
to miss more than one day of classes.
5. No interference with registra
tion cards.
6. No interference with organized 
recitation classes.
The adoption of these rules marked 
an important step in the growth of or
ganized and regulated class spirit. An 
excess of any nature has a stunting ef
fect upon the7 growth of the individual 
or organization involved. Class spirit 
can be carried to excess, and the nat
ural outlet is the 'banquet. Heres 
hoping that we will have a better Car
negie spirit as the outgrowth of the 
above, regulations.
PSYCHOLOGY DEPARTMENT
HOLDS WEEKLY SEMINAR
During the month of October, a 
Seminar in Applied Psychology is to 
be held in Room 235 A, Central Build
ing, every Thursday afternoon at 3:30. 
This Seminar is for the purpose of ac
quainting those interested, with the re
search work in progress in this insti
tution in the field of Applied Psychol
ogy. It is planned to bring up in this 
Seminar what has been accomplished 
recently and what is being planned at 
the present time in this field. Mem
bers of the faculty and graduate stu
dents are invited to attend meetings 
of the Seminar, even if they are not 
registered in it. The sessions sched
uled are as follows:

The Mandolin Club has sent out its 
call for men who have any ability in 
the musical line. Instruments needed 
include mandolins, guitars, banjos, 
violins, and cellos.
Rehearsals, held Sunday afternoons 
from 2:30 to 4:30 in the Union, are 
under the capable direction of Signor 
Scalzo, who is serving his thirteenth 
year as Master of the Baton.
Mandolinists are enjoying these 
afternoons with SignorScalzo, who 
has built up the club in the past, and 
made it one of the important factors 
of Carnegie campus life.
The Glee Club is also progressing 
rapidly. Mr. Edward Riehl conducted 
the singing Sunday afternoon in the 
exhibition room of the Fine Arts 
Building.
GRAPHICA CLUB TO HAVE 
CHARGE OF JOB PRINTING
Job printing work, heretofore done 
by individual students in the Depart
ment of Printing, is to be taken care 
of entirely by the Graphica. Plans 
are now under way so that the work 
will be conducted under an organiza
tion similar to that of a commercial 
printing concern.
The work will be done during spare 
hours by the members of the depart
ment and charged for at regular com
mercial rates. The proceeds derived 
therefrom are to go into the Graphica 
treasury to he used' for an inspection 
trip next year.
This plan, if carefully worked out, 
will be good experience for the future 
printers. Since it is to be run exact
ly as a trade plant, it will 'be the most 
practical instruction possible for fu
ture executives.
All kinds of printed matter will be 
handled, -such as dance programs, let
ter heads, name cards, posters, etc. 
No soliciting will be done, as. it is 
thought that there will be sufficient 
work brought in without advertising 
for it.

WEDNESDAY. OCTOBER 11, 1922THE CARNEGIE TARTANPAGE THREE
PLAD ATHLETICS
Tartans Will Clash 
Saturday With W.&J.
Old Rivals Primed For Annual 
Struggle in Washington.
Next Saturday is one of the red let
ter days on the Camegie Tech foot
ball schedule. The entire student 
body will; probably board the Tech 
Special for Little Washington to wit
ness the struggle between the Presi
dents and the wearers of the Plaid.
The Washington and Jefferson team 
have .won all of their games this 
season and have practically the same 
team with which they defeated the 
Tartans, last year, by the score of
14-0. Brenkert, West, and Basista are 
performing just as well this year as 
they did last year and with these 
men in ..the backfield it requires a 
mighty good team to stop them. The 
Carnegie Tech game will be the first 
big game of the season for Washing
ton and Jefferson and Coach Neale 
has been priming his men for this 
game. Scouts from W. & J. have wit
nessed all of the Carnegie games since 
the beginning of the season and they 
have reported all of the Carnegie 
games to Coach Neale. Neales squad 
have been coached to break up these 
plays but Coach Steffen of the Tar
tans will probably liav a few sur
prises for them when the two teamsline up at Washington for this strug
gle.
Last Saturday, the Red and Black 
defeated the heavy Bethany team by 
the score of 19-7 and this one game 
gives a very good idea of the strength 
of W. & J. Both teams are very even
ly matched and it would be extremely 
difficult to pick out the best team be
fore the game is played.
Which, for no reason at all, reminds 
me of the professor who was so ab
sent minded that he would lay his 
clothes on the bed carefully, and then 
throw himself over the back of the 
chair.Rensselaer Polytechnic.
ENTRANCE AT M0REW00D 
AVENUE TO HAVE ARCH
During the last summer, the city 
and trolley company have been making 
repairs on Forbes street, which re
sulted in the replacing of the pave
ment at the Moorewood entrance to 
our campus. As a result a new pave
ment, with concrete steps, have now 
been finished. No more will we be 
bothered by the icy incline as we 
hurry on cur way to our S: 30 class. 
The cinder path is being regraded to 
suit the conditions.
Incident with these improvements, 
we will have a new inrormal entrance. 
The new walls arc made of sandstone 
rocks and are placed so as to give 
a rustic effect.
A column will be built on each side 
of the entrance and will be about sev
en feet high, with a cone shaped top. 
Lights are to be placed at suitable 
points.
The land adjoining the walls is be
ing well graded and sodded with grass. 
Later bushes and shrubery are going 
to be planted. Ivy will be permitted 
to grow over the columns and thus 
add much beauty to the entrance. This 
will take time, but when completed 
will give a very pretty effect.
These improvements are not plan
ned as final, because sometime in the 
future, real improvements will be con
structed, which will harmonize with 
the architecture of the buildings.

representation the night school should 
have on the Student Activities Board 
since so small a number of students 
registered had chosen to pay an activ
ities fee. Under the old system where
by the night students were required 
to pay the activities fee each school 
had a representative on the iStuden.t 
Activities Board. After a great deal 
of discussion, and mainly because of 
the fact that the Board was the only 
connection between the day and night 
school, it was decided to follow the 
same plan as last year, and allow the 
night school the same number of rep
resentatives as last year.
A Club Room Committee consisting 
of Marshall, chairman; Roy and 
Griggs was appointed by the presi
dent. Dykeman, Dean Tarbell, Miss 
Iiulton, and Marshall, were put on 
the Budget Committee.
An Organization Report Committee 
is to be appointed in the near future 
to consider the reports and recom
mendations of managers of the va
rious student activities.
It was reported that Turcotte was 
appointed temporary manager of the 
Musical Clubs and will hold office un
til organization of the clubs is com
plete and a new and permanent man
ager is elected by the members of the 
Musical Clubs.
A check was made to cover the Y. 
M. C. A. bill.
It was decided that the Students 
Activity fee would be divided as fol
lows: $11.40 to the A. A. of which
$1.00 goes to the womens division in
stead of 50 cents as before; $3.49 to 
the Student Activities Board, and 20

JUST ANOTHER
Victory for Wally Steffen and his red demons. Coming hero with a 
reputation of holding W. & J. to a hard earned 14-0 score, the Covenanters 
failed to make much of a defensive showing against the onslaught of the 
Tartans. The Presidents were held for three quarters while our team was 
not to be denied, marching to a touchdown in the first few minutes of play 
and following it up with three more. However, this does not mean that. Car
negie Tech followers should become too confident concerning next Saturdays 
game at Little Washington. Geneva uncorked some real offensive that had 
the Skibos guessing at times. One thing that was particularly gratifying was 
the cutting down on fumbles although one was disastrous to the Plaid hopes 
of holding Geneva scoreless.
Coach Parks has a formidable aggregation of players which will no doubt 
make a strong bid for Class B. honors. Incidentally he was coach of Carnegie 
Tech's 1921 reserve team.
ON TO WASHINGTON
This should be the cry of every Carnegie student. Last year a series 
of special trains carried more than a thousand Tartan rooters to College 
Field at Little Washington. With this mass of supporters behind them the 
team played supei-football and nearly accomplished the triumph of the pre
vious season. Excursions will be run again this year and with the low cost 
no loyal Carnegie Tech student should remain in Pittsburgh on Saturday 
afternoon. It is an event that comes but once during the year and the trip 
will be something you will never forget. So let's go down and help inject 
some more red in the Red and Black.
O'Connor Too Steady For 
His Final Opponent.
TENNIS
The fall tournament has probably been the most successful in several 
years. OConner and Van Atta are both new men and should be strong 
aspirants for the two vacant positions on the Tartan squad when Coach 
Garland lines the men up next spring. Just now Colonel Brooks is keeping 
an eye on the men and putting them through a little fall practice.
THE PLAID HARRIERS
Will again bear watching, for the new men aloug with some of the sec
ond string men of last season are keeping right on the heels of the few 
veterans that are left. With the opening meet but a little over a week off 
Coach Beeler is pushing the men along toward the first trials this week. 
Some of the men who are showing particularly well are: Hinderer, Menden
hall, McKelvie, Sampson, Bright, Bell and Scliofer.
SPEAKING OF
Old Eli having a nightmare, heres one "Cap Dosey tells on a Yale 
Freshman. It seems that he got into a heated conversation with the Frosh 
and finally the Plebe pipes up with, Do you know that here are eleven Y 
men out there on the field? Then Cap comes back with this reply: "Well, 
I presume there are some Y men on our team.
THESE INJURIES
Are bad things for the squad particularly just before one of the big 
games. In the Yale game, Moran, one of the regular Tartan halfbacks, had 
his shoulder badly dislocated. In fact it was necessary to operate in order 
to get the ligaments straightened out and the shoulder back in placo. In 
last Saturdays game against Geneva, Taylor, A1 Irwins understudv at cen
ter, suffered a broken jaw. Taylor started the game at the pivot position 
for the Plaid but was forced to leave the game in the third quarter. Both of 
these men have been filling their positions in fine style and they desorvo 
particular recognition from the students.
IMPROVEMENTS MADE 
IN DESIGN SCHOOL
Many inprovements have been made 
in the building of the College of Fine 
Arts during the summer which are 
sure to prove of marked value. In 
general they consist of the use of 
waste space for classrooms in order 
to accommodate the fast growing en
rollment of the famous school.
In the. basement, the room which 
was formerly used for the girls lock
er room and kitchen has been made 
into a sort of clubroom for the Dmmat3 where they may rehearse plays, 
or loaf, just as their time dictates. 
The locker room has been moved to 
thejarger room to the right of the old 
locker room.
Behind the. scenes at the Little 
Theater, there will be six badly need
ed dressing rooms. The celling is two 
stories high in this part of the build
ing, and by placing a balcony around 
part of It, space has been obtained for 
several new rooms.
It is in the P. and I. department 
that the most extensive changes have 
been made. All the studios along 
the south side of the hall running be
tween the two wings have been made 
into classrooms. These were form
erly used by the professors for their 
work, but the increasing number of 
ambitious artists made it necessary to 
utilize them for other purposes. Above 
these studios was the roof, pierced by 
skylights and apparently useless for 
anything other than lighting. But 
during the summer, a floor was placed 
over those lights which were in the 
ceiling of the rooms below, and fine 
studios for the use of the faculty were 
made. These are even better than the 
ones on the floor below on account of 
their better lighting and arrangement.
There are still many things which 
might be done in the College of Fine 
Arts. In the Drama Department it is
CHEERING PRACTICE
AT SCIENCE ASSEMBLY
In the absence of the speaker of 
the day at last week's Science As
sembly, the meeting was turned over 
to a singing and cheering practice. 
Arrangements had been made for a 
member of the Pittsburgh Fire Asso
ciation to address the assembly on 
"Fire Prevention, which was featur
ed throughout the country during the 
weekof October 2-9.
The president of the assembly read 
a list of Plebos exempted from regula
tions, and advised all Plobes claiming 
exemption to file petitions beforo 
November 1.
The  suggestion was made by the 
chairman, that the student, body 
should rise, when any ofllcer of the 
administration entered the assembly 
room, as a mark of respect. 
Announcement was made that somo 
very interesting assembly programs 
had been planned, in which will bo 
featured such attractions as Cy Hungorford, cartoonist; the M. M. String
ers, Art School vaudevillo artists and 
the like.
Cheer Leader Cy" Hoennlnger 
then took charge of the program and 
put over a snappy cheering practice.
Friday afternoon James OConnor, 
a Plebe and former Peabody High boy, 
put the finishing touches on the Car
negie Tech fall tennis tournament by 
defeating Van Atta, also a Plebe, who 
came from Binghamton (N. Y.) High.
Earlier in the week OConnor played 
Roger Marshall a. throe set match in 
order to step into the semi-finals, and 
on Thursday he won two straight sets 
from Hauser, the only remaining man 
to be conquered in the lower half of 
the frame.
Van Atta had uphill work capturing 
the matches from Berno and then H. 
N. Smith, both of whom extended 
their best playing in vain.
From the very outset of the match 
it was apparent as to which player, 
was the more constant, but at no time 
did the winner show signs of over 
confidence although he did take the 
required three sets straight running.
The first set was won by OConnor 
who got a lead of three games over 
his opponent. Both men played a safe 
drivinggame and their vollying re
minded one of the regular oscillation 
of a pendulum.
The second set told the story of 
each players weak spot. OConnor 
began hammering Van Attas back
hand while the latter ran up and re
peatedly broke OConnors return for 
many deuce points.
The third set was steady playing 
but a little more decisive than either 
of the other two.
Serving was not a feature of the 
match. OConnor kept up his slow 
mean serve but Van Atta was way 
below what was expected of him.
Quite a large gallery stayed through
out the entire final round to witness 
the fast and smashing games which 
determined the championship of C. I. 
T. tennis for 1922-23.
The large silvor cup will be pre
sented to James O'Connor, the win
ner, at the general assembly in the 
Music Hall on the date of this pub
lication.
The coach and captain and all those 
directly Interested in the furtherance 
of the tournament fool very well sat
isfied that the objoct, of bringing out 
material for the spring tryouts, was 
accomplished.
MID-WEST HOLDS LUNCHEON
Two years ago Carnegie Tech had 
a hockey team and one that we were 
proud to own as our own. It is true 
that they did not win any games, 
but for the first season they made a 
fine showing. They were twice de
feated by Yale, hold Pennsylvania to 
a. 3 to 3 tie score, later losing a re
turn game by the narrow margin of 
one point and in the final game of 
the season lost to Notre Dame. An 
attempt, was made last fall to revive 
the sport but the efforts failed due 
to the inability of the Plaid Ath
letic authorities to make arrange
ments for Duquesne Garden.
Is it not possible to arouse Interest 
in this ice sport and make another 
start at developing a. first class team? 
Of course practically all of the old 
men are out of school, but it seems 
possible that there are plenty of men 
still in the undergraduate stage who 
might develop into real hockey play
ers.
During the winter mouths basket 
ball is the big sport but it needs 
something to supplement it, some
thing that will give the students a 
change. Hockey is the logical sport 
to accomplish this end. Lets talk 
it up.

necessary to bring the scenery which 
newly made up, through a trap to the 
second floor. Then it must be car
ried along a hall and lowered Into the 
theater, it would be much easier to 
manage if It were arranged so that the 
scenery and stage furniture could be 
made in the space above the theater, 
for then it coukl be lowered dir.ectly 
down.
The improvements of this year, how
ever, are far better than was expected, 
and after next summer those in the 
College of Fine Arts will have no more 
complaints in that way.
All improvements were made under 
the direction of Colonel Fairley, sup
erintendent of Building and Grounds.

PLEBE RECEIVES SWIM
AT INVITATION OF SOPHS
The full Avelght of the hand of au
thority was first felt by the Plebes 
in the person of one of them who was 
summarily given a ducking in the 
tank, on Tuesday. It seems that 
the obstreperous one has been jaunti
ly ignoring all rulesand regulations, 
In spite of repeated warnings. Retri
bution was swift when he was dis
covered on Tuesday without Plebe 
hat or Bible, and proud of it. He was 
at first introduced to a cold shower, 
but he so stoutly declined getting wet 
unless accompanied by some of his 
captora that the more drastic method 
was resorted to. It may be remarked 
by way of information for the rest of 
the Plebes that the drought has not 
affected the local water supply in the 
least.

BY REP.
Outweighed, but not outgamed, tho 
fast Carnegie Tech Freshman eleven 
returned from Slippery Rock with de
feat chalked up against them. The 
Normal School aggregation was ontho heavy end of a 13 to 0 score. 
From (he Initial boot until the final 
blast from the. referees whistle, the 
Tartan youngsters fought an uphill 
battle against superior weight on a . 
foreign field1.
Tho Plaid frequently carried the 
fight to the enemy's territory and 
gained many yards via the forward 
pass. In fact, the aerial attack was 
their best ground gainer. The Slip
pery Rock team resorted principally 
to line plunging and end running for 
the gair.s which resulted in touch
downs.
The first score of the contest 
camo in the first quarter when the 
opposition made their first touch'down. Stephenson drop-kicked for one 
more point and the score stood 7 to 
0, Slippery Rock. The same team 
scored again in the third frame, 
Stephenson this time failing to send 
the oval through the proper area. 
The score now stood 13 to 0, which 
It remained for the rest of the game.
No single player stood out above 
his teammates as a brilliant expo
nent of the art of chasing the pig
skin; the team worked; togethor as a 
unit, a credit to the teachings of 
Coach Beeler. The work of Beode 
and Gross might, however, be men
tioned as being of merit.
The contest was played on a. slop
py, slippery Hold, reminding tho Plaid 
hooters no doubt of their own back
yard-In contrast. Carnoglo made 
frequent substitutions, the second 
stringers showing very good form.

NEW YORK CLAN TO 
HOLD DINNER DANCE
Tuesday, October Fourth 
Set For Meeting In 
New York.
The New York Clan will hold its 
next dinner and dance Tuesday eve
ning, October 24, at the Trianon Res
taurant, 2824 Broadway near One Hun
dred and Ninth street. The commit
tee in charge is planning on a large 
attendance at this dinner and urgent
ly requests the co-operation of all Car
negie students and 'alumni in the t'!K 
Gork district. Mark the date on your 
calendar now so that you will not for
get it. Pass the word along to others, 
who may not have received the regu
lar printed schedule of events. The 
dinner will be served at seven oclock 
and dancing will follow. Lets go!
Our clan was well represented at 
the New Haven doings and we want 
the same old spirit to continue. We 
congratulate the New Haven Clan on 
the excellent manner in which they 
entertained us and we extend them an 
invitation to attend any or all of .our 
events.
Our last dinner was very much en
joyed although the crowd was not as 
large as it should have been. Pat 
Hoban came all the way from Detroit 
and we were glad to see him. He 
held the crowd breathless when he re
lated some hairbreadth experiences 
which lie had during recent travels. 
He has an interesting line. Come 
again Pat.
Congratulations to /Mr. and Mrs. 
Jack Cameron. How about a speech, 
Jack?
M. M. C. C. CLAN AT CLEVELAND
The Cleveland Cj4n of Margaret 
Morrison College alumnae was organ
ized during the summer past|. Offi
cers were elected as follows:
President, Mary Ride Lees, 16; 
vice president, Dorothy Harlow, 19; 
secretarj-treasurer, Eleanor Clark 
Speaker, 11.
Arrangements were made to have 
monthly meetings during the year and 
the first of these was a picnic meet
ing held at the home of Mary Ride 
Lees on Saturday, September 23.
Some of us had never met the rest 
of us before and it was a joyful re
union to others who hadnt seen each 
other for a long time. Any first 
strange feelings were soon thawed 
out, class distinctions and prejudices 
were forgotten in the fact that we 
were all alumnae of the same great 
old Alma Mater. We look forward to 
many more such gatherings this win
ter. Georgia Clark, Oralle Hepburn, 
Mildred Laurence, Maude Hainer 
Montgomery, Martha Patter Foster, 
Manilla Stoddard,, Eleanor Clark 
Speaker and daughter Eleanor (aged 
five weeks), Helen Hester and Mary 
Ride Lees were those present.
It -is hoped that any Techites from 
Margaret Morrison who may visit 
Cleveland or come to live there will 
get in touch with some member of 
the Clan and arrange to be present 
at any of our meetings if possible.

WHY IS THE SOCIETY MAN
A BUSINESS FAILURE?
Why is the successful society man, 
a business failure? Why is the man 
who holds interest, makes friends and 
gains popularity, often a failure as an 
executive.
The fundamental reason is that he 
carries his receptive, social attitude 
into business instead of assuming a 
domineering business attitude.
He listens to everyone, tries to 
please allyields to their opinions 
and wishes. He is too easy with men, 
and the ones he does most for im
pose upon liiin.
If he is to be successful in busi
ness, he must be serious, strong, in
dependent, aggressive. 1-Ie must not 
be too receptive. Once set out to do 
a thinghe must not yield.
If you are a good fellow, dont let' 
your friends work for you. Try the 
forceful attitude. Youll get more re
spect and less imposition. Your ad
vancement will be sure.

The 1923 Thistle Board is confront-! 
ed with a mighty stiff proposition 
namely, to sell more year books to 
less students. -In order to carry out 
the plans, they must rely upon the 
alumni body for support and the sup
port most needed is subscriptions. The 
presidents of the various clans are 
urged to do everything in their power 
to drive this point home to the mem
bers of their organizations.
The Maldo, the Ohio State year 
book, depends largely upon the sub
scription of the graduates. There is 
no reason that the Carnegie Thistle 
should not receive like help.
The more recent graduate certainly 
wants to know what his friends in the 
school have been doing. Thistle will 
give you that information. The older 
alumnus wants to know how the 
school itself is progressing, what type 
of man Carnegie is turning out. This
tle will show you in word and by pic
ture. Every alumnus is proud of the 
team that held Yale to one touchdown. 
The Thistle will introduce you to 
every man that played in that game.
Hand in your subscription at once. 
If you live in Pittsburgh send $4.50, 
If you live outside; of'-Pittsburgh add 
25 cents for postage. Make checks 
payable to Vincent Roy. Mail to the 
1923 Thistle, care Carnegie Institute 
of Technology, Postoffice. There is 
one other item to remember and that 
isMail that subscription now! The 
reason for this request is given on 
page one of this issue.

Publicity Department Puts 
Carnegie Before Public
It was not until several weeks ago 
that the students of Carnegie Tech 
became aware of the fact that Car
negie had a department known as the 
publicity office. At that time the Tar
tan contained an article telling of the 
serious injury of Mr. Clark, the head 
of the department, in an automobile 
accident.
This office is one of the busiest of
fices in the Central building. From 
this place originates most of the in
formation that goes out concerning 
the school. The whole purpose of the 
department is to show the utside 
world what Carnegie is doing. Pre
ference is shown to no one college of 
the school, all are treated alike and 
are boosted for their own advantages. 
In carrying out this purpose, use is 
made not only of the daily papers, 
but also the technical papers and 
magazines are given "dope on in
teresting happenings at Carnegie. 
When new processes are formulated, 
new ideas drafted, or new theories 
propounded by members of the facul
ty, these facts are made known to 
the various magazines interested and 
thus a knowledge of our doings is 
spread.
Mr. Clark is a man of wide experi
ence in work of this nature. Prior to 
his coming to Carnegie, he was In ad
vertising work in New York. City for. 
some of the leading magazines and 
also for a large advertising concern. 
In the recent automobile accident 
he received injuries that will require 
him to take a leave of absence of at 
least six weeks.
During Mr.. Clarks absence the of
fice will be in charge of R. M. R. 
Tudury, who is also a New York man. 
He will be assisted by Miss Ann
Blatt, who was associated with Mr. 
Clark. Mr. Tudury has been in news
paper work in the south and middlewest and lately has been connected 
with the literary department of Vani
ty Fair. Mr. Tudury) attended the
University of Virginia and also Tulane University. Mr. Tudury and his 
wife will make their residence in
Pittsburgh until the return of Mr. 
Clark.
To leave an umbrella in the vesti
bule of a church, is a sure test of 
Christian faith.
Dean: So you broke a chair over
this Freshmans head!
SophI didnt mean to break the 
chair, sir.Mugwump.
That much anticipated and memor
able day of September 30th has come 
and gone. What it held in store for 
the Tech men of the east has been di
vulged and to say the least it exceed
ed the fondest expectations of the 
most optimistic. It. for the first time, 
gave New England Yankees their 
first experience with Tech men and 
their indomitable and unbeatable 
spirit. At the game a New Haven 
lassie remarked: What a wonder
ful spirit, when things in the game 
went awry.
New Haven was swept off its feet 
by the surging into the gameof so 
many Tech men, for they thought: 
This is only a small college and we 
will have to go out to the game and 
help that helpless little team along. 
But they did not reckon with that 
Skibo spirit and instead they were 
forced to help their own giants 
i when the little Skibos drove the bull
dog to his lair. They no longer won
der who Carnegie is. for now it is all 
Tech in their reference to that 
small Pittsburgh Technical School, 
as they once thought it was. They 
have been given something, to think 
about and they. shudder to think at 
what the consequences could easily 
have been.
Tech Alumni now can walk over 
the bull-dog campus and when asked 
about their college can proudly say: 
Carnegie ..Tech, and right away 
nothing further need be said. Such 
a scare has seldom been given to the 
New Haven college boys and they are 
thanking their lucky stars things 
broke as they did.
When everyone had finally gotten 
into the bowl, you could hardly be
lieve those peepers of yours. Just 
about double the number that had 
registered in the morning were there 
and the most pessimistic cuss in the 
crowd swore there was not less than 
two hundred there. But where did 
they all pop up from, was the big 
question, and many had a hard job to 
believe there could bo so many fol
lowers of the Scottish Plaid around. 
They were there and that was the 
biggest satisfaction, where from no 
one cared, they were just plainly 
there bent on one purpose.
The game needs no further com
ment here except to say that we, as 
alumni, are mighty proud of the
team Wnlly Steffen has developed. 
To see the way they played so early 
in the season against the biggest and 
most highly-touted team in the east, 
and to see them drive the bull dog 
back to his last resourcescan you 
blamo us for wanting to put Wnlly 
in the Hall of Fame even though he 
was kicking himself because ho
couldnt beat em? It wasnt his
fault that he didn't and our hats aro 
off to him. From the game all hands 
managed to amble their way back to 
the hotel.
At six bells, as soon as the team 
arrived at the Garde, tile committee 
had a little worry as to whether the 
table reservations wore all going to 
be taken. At G:.'50 thoy woro not
worrying that way for their only wor
ry then was ' to get oxtra places 
enough provided' for the blggost and 
most representative Tech crowd ever 
gathered together in New England. 
This affair as the first in New Eng
land should go down in Teqh history 
as a memorable one.
At eight, after the old-timers 
had had1 the clianco to stretch 
their lungs on Dear Old 
Tech, the party went to the railroad 
station to see the team off, and a 
good majority of those from New 
York, New'.Tersey way took the same 
train. Ross Hertz nearly wrecked 
the nerves of the station master when 
he climbed up onto the balcony rail 
in the roof of the station and led the 
crowd in a Short Speller and the 
Long Carnegie that echoed through
out the big waiting room and left in 
New Haven's ears a cry that will 
long be heededto attest ask a New 
Haven alumnus who is smoking Yale 
cigars, won on a margin of twentyone points.

Helen Stewart, Alumni Worker, Dies
The student body and alumni throughout the entire country were 
shocked by the news of the death of Helen Stewait, Ihst Sunday, Oc
tober 1. Miss Stewart had been in ill health for some time, but her 
indomitable spirit kept her on the job until last Tuesday, at which 
time, under protest, she went home for a rest. Her condition was so 
serious Saturday that she was taken to the Presbyterian Hospital, 
where she died Sunday night at eleven oclock.
Miss Stewart graduated from the Old Central High School of 
Pittsburgh and in 1911 from the secretarial course of the Margaret 
Morrison College. From her first day on the Campus she was a loyal 
Techite. Her interest in Tech and Tech affairs, never wavered, even 
Saturday evening she was keenly interested in heaiing what the boys 
had done at Yale and was delighted at the showing they made. While 
in school Miss Stewart took part in practically every activity, both 
athletic and non-athletic, and after graduation was most active in 
alumni work, having filled almost every office in the Margaret Mor
rison Association and later in the Federation. For the past three 
years and a half she was directly associated with the alumni office In 
the capacity of assistant in alumni work, managing editor of the C. 
I. T. Alumnus, and In charge of the employment for women, both grad
uate and undergraduate.
Always ready to carry more than her share in any kind of alumni 
work she was one of the mainstays in the recent athletic drive. She 
was the real "mother" of the Alumni Federation and a staunch sup
porter of any movement which would further or build up the tradi
tions of Tech. Every student on the Campus knew her line person
ality and certainly she will be missed more than can be estimated 
now. It will be up to every member of the present student body and 
of the Alumni Federation to help close the gap which has been left by 
her death, and to carry on the good work which has only been started.
Her fine spirit and personality can never die. It should be looked 
up to by every student and alumnus as the true example of real Tech 
Spirit.
She is survived by her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Homer C. Stewart, 
and a brother, Brady W. Stewart.

If you are within a radius of fifty 
miles of New Haven and feel the doTartan and C. |l. T. Alumnus 
siro toattempt to start a live, boost. .

drop' a lino to this eiYect, to R. W.
Arnold, S9 Prospect avenue, West 
Haven, Conn. Now that we have 
pried a way into the eye of New 
England this is the logical method 
of (following it up and keeping this 
eye open.
The events of the Yale-Tech game 
brought out the fact that there are 
sufficient men, unheard of before, in 
this terrtory to form a real live clan.
This would give us the proper organ
ization to handle such affairs as that 
of the 30th, and also affairs of a so
cial nature.
Meetings would be held three to 
four times a year, or as the occasion 
called for, in New Haven. It is earn
estly) desired to obtan expressions 
from all Tech alumni in Connecticut 
who would be willing to attempt this 
and who, realizing the state of af
fairs relative to the Tecli-Pitt com
bine, believe we could be of some 
service to Tech and be a real force 
in upholding our Alma Mater not 
only in this but other ways.
It is estimated that there are from 
l'OO to 150 alumni scattered about 
Connecticut, who if centralized under 
one organization could bring force to 
bear 'for the good of Tech, which is 
impossible at present.
Think this over and If you can con
scientiously believe that you could 
come to two meetings a yea.r, drop a 
lino to Arnold so that some plan for 
an organization meeting may bo 
formed. We want a clan that will 
not soon be obliviated and for this 
reason consider this seriously and 
not on the impulse of the moment.
Then let us know wheUier or not you 
are willing to investigate this propo
sition.
HOME ECONOMICS GIVEN 
IN PART TIME CLASSES
The Home Economics Part-Time 
Courses, which begin at Carnoglo In
stitute of Technology this week are 
being offered free. This is duo to the 
fact that the Smlth-Hughes Federal 
Government fund, distributed through 
the United States, Is meant for just 
such cases as this. All toachors aro 
urged to take advantage of thoso part 
time courses, inasmuch as it affords 
them an opportunity or arranging their 
hours in a convenlont manner. There 
will bo late afternoon and Saturday 
morning courses.
While teachers especially are urged 
to participate, the classes are open to 
any high school graduate. The term 
boglns this woolc, oxtondlng Into June. 
There will bo four courses listed undor Home Economics  Nutrition 
Costume Design, iSpecial Methods In 
Vocation Homo Economics, and Trade 
Dressmaking.
Two of the many things which ono 
should got out of a college education 
are theoretical knowledge and asso
ciations. For the theoretical lcuowlodge, the student pays, what seems 
to him, a large sum in the form of 
tuition installments. He expects this 
investment to show results in the 
form of increased responsibilities, 
influence, and therefore salary.
However,' it is only through the ef
forts of our benefactors that the sum 
is a^s small as it is. Did you know 
that you paid In tuition about onethird of the cost of the training you 
received at C. I. T.? Does that not 
bring home to you some idea of your 
obligation to your Alma Mater?
Along with your theoretical knowl
edge, you as a student incidentally 
acquired associations which should 
have proved of great value to you if 
if you retained those associations. 
I-Iavo you capitalized? You can re
tain those associations only by being 
actually present on the campus, or by 
reading the Tartan and the C. I. T. 
Alumnus. Since the first is not pos
sible, the most logical step is for you 
to join the Alumni Association. Kick 
in and receive the Tartan and the 
C. I. T. Alumnus free for one year 
in addition to the 'privileges of mem
bership In the Federation.
If you are delinquent, $'1.00 will put 
you in good standing. If you are not 
delinquent, $2.00 will keep you in 
good standing and entitle you to the 
Tartan and Alumnus for the coming 
year. Make chocks payablo to G. L, 
Tllbrook, treasurer.

Mr. Koun, Eng. Stud. 
Tells of Korean Life
Studied in Other Schools Be
fore Coming Here.
Life for tho rich man In tho United 
'States is ideal, while in Korea he has 
no opportunity to spend his money, 
is tho way V. Ii. Koun, a Korean Chem
istry student, sums up things. Mr. 
Koun enrolled nt Tech two weeks ago, 
coming hero from Ohio University. Ho 
has been in the United States Cor sev
eral years, in that time, studying at 
the San Jose High School, California 
Academy, Ohio State University and 
Ohio University. His specialty is 
chemistry and he has come to Tech 
to take advantage of the exceptional 
courses offered.
Mr. Koun is a Presbyterian, as well 
as his family in Pyang, Korea. They 
dropped their native religion with the 
advent of the missionaries twenty 
years ago. Formerly he was a believ
er in Confucianism, which is particu
larly strong in Korea.
In addition to Confucianism, the 
Lama belief is widely followed in Ko
rea, said Mr. Koun, 'this is really a 
form of Buddhismbelievers In this 
1iilth never marry and liVe like monks. 
Also they eat no foods other than rice 
and greensmoat in any form is nev
er touched.
"The educational system bore, said 
Mr. Koun, is of course far superior to 
tho teachings In Korea. With the ex
ception of a little lower mathematics, 
tho only studios encouraged are those 
dealing with ctliics, history and clas
sical. Sports are practically unnkown 
to the students at Korean schools and 
living conditions aro far inferior to 
those in the Unltod iStatos.
Only In tho larger cities aro chairs 
used. In my homo wo used cush
ions, our foods woro flsli, moat and 
greens, the latter taken In tho spring 
from the mountainside and stored 
away through the winter. Our houses 
moctly, have mud walls. Families in 
Koroa, do not separate as they do 
hero. In a village of three Hundred 
homos it is a coniimon tiling to lliul 
only throe families represented.
