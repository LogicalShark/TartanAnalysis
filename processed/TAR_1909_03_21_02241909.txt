VOL. Ill, No. 21 PITTSBURG, PA., WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 24, 1909TEN CENTS
THE ALLEGHENY GAME
On its last public appearance the basket-ball team 
met defeat, with which it had carried on a vigorous 
flirtation at the previous game. The Allegheny team 
is fast, in fact quite too fast for our team, on Satur
day evening, and we do not wonder from the form 
shown by the aggregation from Meadville, that they 
have only been beaten on their home floor twice in 
the last couple of years.
The Tech crowd turned out better than for any 
game this season, and Allegheny was well represent
ed by a bunch of alumni that made up in enthusiasm 
what it lacked in number. The rooting was pretty 
continuous throughout the evening, and if rooting 
would shoot baskets we would undoubtedly have won.-
The game meant a good deal to us, for if we had 
won, the championship would have been practically 
cinched. Up to this game neither team had lost a 
league game, and unfortunately we were the ones to 
have our hitherto spotless record sullied. We have 
a chance, a slim one however, to retrieve ourselves 
when we meet Allegheny on their home floor. More 
impossible things have been done than beating a 
team like Allegheny on its home floor, and let us hope 
that our team can turn this seemingly impossible 
trick.
Allegheny took the lead early in the game and 
held it until the end. Our team showed lack of 
ability to hit the basket from the field, thus furnish
ing more striking testimony of the need of a gymnas
ium here at the schools. Baker of Allegheny is said 
to be able to hit the basket from any angle, and from 
any position. Any one seeing him at work could 
very easily believe that statement, as he gave the 
best exhibition we have seen this year.
Brown played a good game, and Leety was able to 
get in the game again. Our forwards were kept 
smothered nearly the entire game, and were unable
to do anything a great deal of the time. It is to be
hoped that our form will have improved sufficiently 
to make it interesting for Allegheny at the return 
game Friday night.

4THE TARTANs
MwI^dsIhv w4JIhMsdP
The trouble with the ordinary technical graduate 
is that when he gets his diploma, and can play three 
scales and Home, Sweet Home on the engineering 
piano with one finger, he thinks he is second only to 
Paderewski. He forgets, or rather he has never real
ized, that long experience in actual construction is 
necessary before he can safely and surely apply his 
mathematical theories to everyday work.
The engineering school does teach a man a whole 
lot about how to build engines, that it is very essen
tial that he should know, but the only way to learn 
to build engines is to build engines. In this, connec
tion, hear the sad story of Jones:
Jones was a young, quite recent, technical gradu
ate, and what he did not know about engineering was 
not worth knowing. Jones had not specialized par
ticularly on thermodynamics, but he thought he 
knew something about it, and there is no doubt that 
he passed his examinations. Jones was great on 
accurate calculations; nothing worried him so much 
as leaving off the decimals; why, he could figure out 
the proper diameter of a staybolt to nine places of 
decimals and tell the probable error and all that. 
Jones was a very decent fellow, but one thing he 
hated, and that was to notice th^e awful, inaccurate, 
rule-of-thumb methods which prevailed in some 
shops. Why, in one shop Jones had visited, instead 
of having the last (batch of bolts iron properly tested 
as to its elastic limit, ultimate tensile strength and 
resistance to shear, and calculating the allowable 
stresses and figuring a factor of safety, the superin
tendent had just casually remarked that he guessed 
six five-eighth bolts would do for that there flange, 
and that was all there was about it. It was simply 
shocking that such practices were allowed in this 
scientific age.
Well, one day, at the club, Jones was comfortably 
explaining to the company the beautiful accuracy of 
scientific mathematical calculation as compared with 
the unreliable guesswork of cut-and-try schemes, 
when an acquaintance, Brown, by name, who was in 
the gas-engine business, asked him if he could give 
any simple, accurate, method of calculating the com
pression pressure in a gasolene-engine cylinder when 
the percentage of clearance was known.
Why, certainly, said Jones, swallowing the bait 
whole, quite pleased at the opportunity to be of 
assistance. The pressure of a gas varies inversely 
as the volume, Mariottes law, you know. Pressure 
multiplied by volume before compression equals 
pressure by volume after compression, like this, 
and he stepped to a small blackboard and wrote:
PI V1 = P2V2.
Oh! I see, said Brown, who knew something of 
mathematics himself, even though he was a practical 
man. Well, just for an example, what would a 
pressure gage show the compression to be on an 
engine with, say, 20 per cent, of the total cylinder 
volume as clearance?
Thats easy, replied Jones. The normal air 
pressure is 14.7 pounds, and we call the total volume 
100; then the clearance will be 20. Then he laid 
out the following:
PI = 14.7. VI = 100. V2 = 20.
PI VI = P2 V2. P2 = 73.5
There, thats it: 73.5 pounds compression.
Must be something wrong, said Brown. I saw 
an engine with 20 per cent, clearance tested and it 
had 110 pounds.
Jones checked over his figures. Cant find any
thing wrong with the figures; must be the equation 
thats wrong. Umum. Say! that equation is 
wrong. I have got the isothermal instead of the
adiabatic equation. You see the air gets hot when
it is compressed and that runs the pressure up. I 
should have written the equation this way:
Px V, 141 = P3 V2 1-41.
I guess this will bring it out about right.
Jones always carries a little table of logarithms in 
his pocket and pretty soon he said rather dubiously: 
That works out to 142 pounds compression; seems 
about as far out too high as the first one was too 
low.
Well, put it on the board beside the other, any
way, said Brown. After awhile well average them 
up. Looks to me, though, that you forgot to sub
tract 14.7 from your figure to get the gage pressure. 
Youve got the absolute.
Why, so I have, replied Jones. Never thought 
of ._iat; but, say, that first figure was too high by the 
same amount. It should have been only 58.8 pounds. 
The last one looks a little better now, though; 142 
14.7 = 127 pounds compression gage. That engine 
you saw must have had leaks in its.
No it didnt, said Brown. But it strikes me the 
Prof. John Perry says that 1.41 is too high for air;
1.37 is the proper figure.
Well, perhaps it is, said Jones, looking slightly 
worried. Ill work it out.
Jones works out again:
Pi Va 1  = P2 V2 1 
P2 = 119
pounds gage.
Getting closer, said Brown. But thats too 
hign -^et; now I come to think of it, some other fellow 
says that 1.33 is the proper figure -to use instead of
1.37.
Jones works out once more:
Pj V! 133 = P2 V2 133 
P2 = 111
pounds gage.
There, thats right, he exclaimed. Your pres
sure gage must have read a pound too low.
Perhaps it did, replied Brown. But seems to 
me that you have missed something. You see there 
is always a slight vacuum in a gas-engine cylinder 
at the end of the suction stroke. The piston moves 
out so fast that the air cannot get through the valve 
quick enough to keep up the pressure. I dont

---------------------------------------------------

THE TARTAN5
suppose the pressure would be over 14 pounds in 
some engines when the piston started on the com
pression stroke.
Jones said nothing, but worked it out with the 
new value for pi:
VI 100
PI = 14 pounds; ------=-------P2 = 10(>
V 2 20
pounds gage.
This is rotten, said Jones. Its getting worse. 
Weve only a few more left, said Brown. Have 
you ever noticed that these mechanically operated 
inlet valves do not close until the piston has moved 
back about 5 per cent, of the compression stroke? 
You did not take that into account.
Oh, well, Ill work it out a few times more, said 
Jones, crossly. That 5 per cent, loss will just about 
have the effect of increasing the clearance to 21 per 
cent, instead of 20 per cent.
Pj Vj 1 31 = P2 V, 131 
VI 100
PI = 14.---------------.
. V2 21 
P2 = 97.
pounds gage.
Jones, theres another thing we did not take into 
account, said Brown. Theres a whole lot of hot 
exhaust gas in the cylinder thats going to warm up 
the charge and send the pressure up a little.
Yes, snapped Jones, and now you mention 
heat, I suppose the cold fresh charge will be warmed 
by contact with the warm cylinder walls, to begin 
with, and the hot compressed charge will be cooled 
by contact with the warm cylinder walls, to finish 
with, and little drops of gasolene will make some 
vapor and raise the pressure, and little leaks around 
the piston will lower the pressure, and if you know 
any more little variable constants or constantly vary
ing variables, why spring them now.
Cheer up, said Brown; dont get worried. Just 
add up all the half decent results youve got and 
strike an average.
Jones works out
127 + 119 + 111 + 106+97
------------------------= 112
5
pounds gage.
Just about right, eh?
Well, almost for the engine I saw, said Brown, 
getting up to go.
Hold onl cried Jones, how the deu^e do you 
figure your compression space to get the right pres
sure?
Well! Ill tell you, replied Brown, though its a 
secret and I wouldnt have it leak out for anything. 
When we get out a new type of engine we open our 
mouth and shut our eyes and make a real good guess; 
then, if the pressure doesnt suit, we juggle the 
lenth of the connecting rod or the depth of the cylin
der head until it does.Power and the Engineer.

Oh, mother, how I want to go out to play. Thus 
spoke the littl6 boy as he sat at the window listening 
to the children in the dirty street below. He tried 
to imagine what they were playing. Now, he thought, 
it must be marbles; now, they were spinning tops; 
and all the time he must sit at this window with 
nothing to do and nothing to look at but the bare, 
dirty tenement walls around him. How dark and 
cheerless it was, too, for it was only for a few min
utes each day that the sun shone brightly into the 
little room. Then the little boy would ask mother 
to move his chair into the sunlight and he would be 
happy and bright for a little while. But after the 
sunshine had left, the room seemed much darker 
than before, and many times the little boy would 
cry softly to himself, for he knew mother did not 
like to see him unhappy. How many times he had 
been unhappy, though, since that dreadful day a 
year before, when he had fallen while playing and 
hurt his back. The doctor had said he must not 
walk, and here in his chair by the window, he had 
sat ever since, only leaving it to be carried to his 
little bed in the corner. Then on days when the 
pain was very bad, he did not leave his bed at all, 
and these were the days when he was most unhappy.
So day after day passed slowly, and monotonously, 
and the little boy grew no better. On one of his 
worst days, as he was lying with his face turned to 
the wall, quietly crying, he heard some one coming 
slowly up the last flight of stairs which led to his 
room. As he heard a soft rap on the door, he dried 
his eyes and turned around just as his mother said, 
Come in. The door opened and there stood the 
Lovely Lady. He called her the Lovely Lady imme
diately, for she seemed to him the most beautiful
creature he had ever seen, with her blue eyes and
light, fluffy hair, and her suit and hat just the
color of her eyes. I have been sent, she said, by
the church, to visit some of the tenement houses, 
and this is my first one. Then she sat down near 
the Little Boys bed, and after much coaxing, he 
told her the story of his fall, then how he wanted to 
be out playing with the other children. But I 
wouldnt mind nearly so much, he said, if I could 
only have something to do, or some pretty picture 
books to look at. But mother says she cannot buy 
anything now and I must be patient and good. 
Then the story came from the mother how, how the 
Father had tried so hard to support them, but had 
failed utterly and had finally broken down and died 
six months before. Since then, there had been lit
tle money, and none to spend on books or playthings 
for the Little Boy. Then the Lovely Lady comforted 
the mother and the Little Boy, and with a cheery 
Good-bye, and a promise of another, visit and a

lovely picture book, she left them. How much 
brighter the day seemed after this visit! The Little 
Boy did not feel at all like crying now, but was so 
excited that when bedtime came, mother had quite 
a lot of trouble making him go to sleep, for he did 
want to talk so badly. Even after he lay asleep, 
mother knew by the smile on his face that he still 
saw the Lovely Lady in his dreams.
The next morning, the sun shone much brighter 
than ever before. The Little Boy and mother were 
having a long talk about the Lovely Lady and the 
promised picture book, when a rap again sounded 
on the door. This time, when mother said Come 
in, the door opened, a basket was set inside, and 
then the door closed again. Mother brought the 
basket to the chair by the window, and read from 
a card tied to the handle, To the Little Boy from 
his friend, Miss Walton. Oh, how fast the Little 
Boys heart beat as mother removed the covering, 
and what wonderful things he saw in the basket. 
First, came all kinds of fruits, such as the Little 
Boy had seen only on the stands along the streets; 
then came two beautiful picture books with bright 
red covers; and then, most wonderful of all, in the 
very bottom of the basket, was a box of paints. Now 
the days need not seem so long, again the room 
would always be cheerful and the Little Boy would 
be happy.
That very afternoon the Lovely Lady came again 
and found the Little Boy sitting in his chair, an 
orange in one hand, the picture book before him, 
and the box of paints within reach of the other hand. 
There were tears in her eyes as she stopped for a 
moment in the door way, but, as the Little Boy 
turned toward her, a happy smile on his face, she 
walked quickly across the room and kissed him 
lightly on the forehead. Then she sat down beside 
him and painted the most beautiful pictures the Lit
tle Boy had ever seen. And then the books; had 
never even dreamed that there could be such won
derful stories as the Lovely Lady read to him. When 
she said she must go, it seemed to the Little Boy 
that she had been with him only a few moments.
Many times after that day, the Lovely Lady came 
to see the Little Boy, and she always brought him 
a present of some sort. Then one day, after reading 
for a little while, she said that the next time she 
came, she would bring a friend of hers, the Great 
Doctor, to see the Little Boy. She never quite be
lieved that the back might not be made well again 
and, now she would know if anything could be done.
The Great Doctor was a very kind looking old 
gentleman, with eyes that twinkled merrily all the 
time. Such funny stories he did tell all the time 
he was looking at the Little Boys back. Just before 
he left he said that the next day he would send a 
carriage which would take the Little Boy to the hos
pital, where the Great Doctor and the Lovely Lady 
wanted him to stay for a while.
How gently the Great Doctor carried him down
stairs the next morning and into a carriage standing
before the door. This was the first time for a year 
that the Little Boy had been outside of his room, 
and everything looked so bright and cheerful that 
it seemed impossible that he had ever been unhappy. 
Then he was driven through many streets until the 
carriage stopped before a large brick building. Then 
the Great Doctor picked the Little Boy up again and 
carried him into a UHBEUC little room, with a plenty 
of light and sunshine. He was laid on a small white 
bed and a lady in a white apron and cap came in 
and spoke a few words to the Great Doctor, and then 
asked the Little Boy how he felt. How could any
one help feeling well to-day? thought the Little 
Boy, but he only answered, Better.  Then the 
Great Doctor and the lady talked together in low 
tones and the Little Boy heard something like One 
chance in ten, but that was all. After that, the 
lady went out and came in a few moments later 
with a young man who carried a lot of wicked-look
ing knives and other instruments. These were 
placed on a long table, and then the Great Doctor 
told the Little Boy that he would have to go to sleep 
for a little while. A large cap was placed over his 
face, and the Little Boy knew nothing more.
When the Little Boy finally awoke, he saw many 
anxious faces around him. Just as he opened his 
eyes, he heard some one say, Thank God! He will 
be better now, and the Great Doctor was leaning 
over him. Where am I, and where are mother and 
the Lovely Lady? asked the Little Boy. You 
must not talk now, said the Great Doctor; you 
have been very sick for three days, and you must 
be very quiet. So the Little Boy could only lie and 
wonder when he could see mother and the Lovely 
Lady, for he knew he must obey the Great Doctor 
and not talk. He had not long to wait, however, for 
soon the door opened, the Little Boy heard some 
one say, softly, Now, do not let him talk, and then 
the Lovely Lady was kissing him. Then she sat 
down beside him and told him that after a little 
while he would be well enough to play again with 
the other children, and he need not stay in his chair 
by the window any longer, and mother will be here 
to see you this afternoon. The Little Boy wanted 
to clap his hands and laugh, but no, he must be still, 
so he could only say, Oh, how glad I am. The 
Lovely Lady then took the Little Boys hand in hers 
and began to tell him a story, just as wonderful as 
those in his beautiful book. After a while the Lovely 
Lady felt the little hand in hers grow lax, and look
ing down, she saw the Little Boy quietly sleeping.

You will be true to me, Teresa? the youth asked 
earnestly, holding both her hands in his big rugged 
ones. "When I earn enough money I shall send for 
you, and you will come?
Yes, Tony, she replied with eyes downcast.
Some one on the ship cried, All aboard, and 
the traveler put forth to sea to try his fortune in 
America.
The lone girl waved her apron as long as she 
could see the ship, then went slowly and sadly 
back to her little cottage home on the hillside. Her 
eyes were dim with tears, but she tried to brush 
them away as she climbed the hillher mother 
might see them and think her unhappy.
The days went by with their usual routine of look
ing after the small household. What spare minutes 
she had, the maiden spent in knitting. While her 
fingers were thus employed her thoughts wandered 
across the sea to her lover in that strange land. Her 
one goat browsed quietly on the hillside. It was a 
typical Italian life. The hills surrounded them on 
three sides. To the east were the yellow sands by 
the sea. The sky and water were of that peculiar 
shade of blue seen only in southern Europe. Above 
all, in lofty majesty, towered the great volcano.
The days still passed, slowly, sadly. Last months 
letter had not come, but America was so far away 
and the mails so uncertain. Perhapsbut he was 
too busy NU|NCD to write on the very day.
One day a roll was handed to her. It contained a 
foreign looking newspaper. She could not read it 
herself, but there was one in the village who could. 
She hurried anxiously through her daily duties, but 
it was quite late before she could spare a few min
utes to go and find him. Her disappointment was 
great when she found that he was away.
I expect him to-morrow, his mother said. Could 
she wait so long? News of any kind from America 
was so precious to her.
She was unable to sleep that night for a long, long 
time. At last she fell into a heayy, dreamless slum
ber, from which she was rudely wakened by being 
thrown out upon the floor. When she had partly re
gained her senses, she realized that the whole uni
verse, seemingly, was trembling violently, accom
panied by terrific noises. She tried to crawl to her 
mothers bed. The awful, sickening rocking was
still going onwould it never stop? Oh! her paper! 
Yes, it was still safe in her bosom. Slowly she 
dragged herself across the floor. Shrieks sounded 
in her earsThe volcano! earthquake! save us! 
Where, oh, where, was her mothers door? At last 
she found it, and as she tried to draw herself up, the 
walls tottered and fell.
Next day the rescuers came to the wreck of the 
little cottage on the hill. In the ruins they found an 
old woman and a young girl. In the girls hands, 
tightly clasped, was an American newspaper torn 
almost to shreds.
The interpreter, a survivor because of his absence 
from the town, took the paper and found a marked 
paragraph, telling of the death, in a mine disaster, 
of one Antonio Botti, Italian.

Miss Alcorn, in her"special recitation on the Al

lovers, will strike this bell as hard as they can, they 
will surely be married before the end of the year.
Miss Harding (sighing)Its a long way to 
Granada, isnt it, girls?
Friday afternoon, Miss Dock, of the Forrestry

mission and thus be deprived of this source of rev
enue from the field to repay our indebtedness; sec
ond, our games would of necessity be transferred 
to foreign fields where our student tickets are not 
good for admission.
IP aP vEE,DP
Mr. Leeds has issued another statement of the 
Athletic Association finances, which we are.printing 
on this page. The consequences of further delinquincy in payment is succinctly set forth in this 
statement, but it seems to take come stronger appeal 
than a bare statement of fact to stir the average 
student. 
According to Mr. Leeds figures, we are liable, 
unless we get busy, to have a field and nothing to 
enclose it, or if the field isnt completed we will be 
forced to play our games on some other grounds 
not under our control. At the time the present 
scheme was broached, enough money was subscribed 
to complete the field and enclose it, so it is self evi
dent that no further subscriptions are necessary, 
unless some of the original guarantees fail to live up 
to their pledges.
The only other arrangements we can make is to 
use the grounds of the Pittsburgh Base-ball Club, 
alternating dates writh the University of Pittsburgh. 
We all know how unsatisfactory is any arrangement 
that does not give us control of our own schedule 
making, to say nothing of the money lost through the 
payment of ground rentals. Any member of the
association who wishes to imform himself, may find 
out for himself the average number of paid admiss
ions at games last fall, and with this data and the 
commission demanded as rental knows it is very 
easy to compute the money lost in paying ground 
rental. This would not cover the use of a field for 
practice, but we would be compelled to use the field 
which we had so ignominiously failed to complete. 
We consider ourselves unfortunate in the matter of 
past expenditures to improve a field only to lose it, 
but has it ever occurred to anyone that the entire 
expense was not twice the ground rent for a single 
year if payment should be made on the basis now 
in force? We all remember the popularity of our 
one excursion into the land of free athletics, and it is 
safe to say that no one cares to see that event how
ever spectacular repeated.
All this argument is of no avail however, the entire 
gist of the matter is, Are we? or, Are we not? going 
to fulfill the pledges we so blithely made. As we 
have already said there are no additional pledges 
asked. All that is necessary is that every one pay 
the amount he pledged and that right soon. When 
the pledges were made, Mr. Leeds said that it would 
not be necessary to pay in all the money before the 
first of March. The first is almost here and a goodly 
majority of the pledges are as yet not taken up. 
If the money is not forthcoming it will be necessary 
to cease operations on the field and accept the use 
of the base-ball grounds. At every meeting are 
some unanimous against playng on foreign fields 
but can it be that our enthusiasm stops short after 
voting an assessment? Let every one appoint him
self a committee of one to see that his subscription 
at least is paid in.
The Junior Prom committee is to be congratulated 
on its success, but there is one point on which, in. 
common with all other dance committees we know of 
they fell down. We refer to the late starting of the 
grand march. It would appear fully as feasible to get 
started at nine oclock, as at nine thirty, and we are 
in hopes that at some future function this can be 
done.
The Thistle Board offers some prizes for approp
riate designs for the Annual. We have reproduced 
the offer as made. In addition to these designs, 
everybody has a duty that they should fulfill, to make 
the book a success. We refer to assisting the Board 
of Editors and the Junior Class, to make this Thistle* /the best ever. Most anyone can think up a grind or 
so, or write a little story on the school, or some of 
the Faculty, or even draw a cartoon. These things 
are what make Student Annuals interesting in after 
years, and it is well nigh impossible for the Board to 
attempt to do the work single handed. So let every 
one drop something in the box for the Thistle, and 
help to make it truly a student product.

In transmitting the following report on electric 
furnaces in German steel works, Consul Thomas H. 
Norton, of Chemnitz, says that apparently it is only 
a question of time until the crucible processes will 
be entirely superseded:
Hitherto electric furnaces in Germany have been 
used chiefly for the treatment of small quantities, 
but now the leading works are beginning to employ 
them on an extensive scale for handling large quan
tities of metal. At the close of 1907 one of the most 
important steel works in the empire engaged in the 
production of cast steel for gears, as well as of the 
softer varieties of malleable cast steel for automo
bile construction and for minor parts, decided to re
place Its battery of crucible furnaces by a large 
electric fusion furnace. The main cause for the 
change was the desire to materially lessen the cost 
of fusion, while not lowering the quality of steel, 
but, on the contrary, improving it, if possible.
The old equipment consisted of 32 furnaces, each 
containing six crucibles with a capacity of 77 pounds. 
They are replaced by a single electric furnace of 
250 horsepower, capable of holding a charge of a 
metric ton (2,205 pounds). A duplicate furnace is 
likewise installed and kept as a reserve for emer
gencies.
Electricity is supplied from the large works of a 
company near Cologne, which furnishes a threephase current of 5,200 volts to quite a large territory 
near the Rhine for both power and illumination. Al
terations in the current intensity are so slight that 
connection is made directly, without the interposi
tion of a regulator, between the furnace and the 
transforming station. At the latter a three-phase 
rotary current, reduced to a tension of 110 volts, is 
supplied.
The production of cast steel in this furnace has 
been carried on since the beginning of 1908 without 
interruption, and with such a degree of success that 
the results are well worthy the attention of Ameri
can steel manufacturers.* Details of the cost and 
process generally are herewith reproduced in some 
fullness, on account of the far-reaching importance 
of this revolution in the central feature of one of the 
leading industries of the United States.
The main product of the furnace has been cast 
steel, containing about .06 per cent, phosphorus, .03 
per cent, sulphur, and from .08 to .18 per cent, car
bon. Occasionally charges of tool steel have been 
cast, containing from, .7 to 1.3 per cent, of carbon, 
with and without the addition of nickel, chromium, 
or tungsten. The material employed is* ordinarily
slugs, cuttings, turning, and other waste of wrought 
iron, costing from $14. 8 to $15.47 per metric ton 
(2,205 pounds) $12.96 to $14.04 per short ton. A 
fusion, including the refining, lasts about five hours 
and involves a consumption of about 900 kilowatt 
hours for 1 metric ton of cast steel. The entire 
charge of 1 ton. is poured at once. When the fur
nace is kept in continual use the magnesite lining 
lasts for about 70 operations, i. e., 20 to 25 days. . A 
stoppage of five days is required for each renewal, 
but during this period the reserve furnace is em
ployed.
The cost of electric current is exceedingly low, on 
account of the large amounts consumed. It amounts 
to 4y2 pfennings (1.071 cents) per kilowatt hour, so 
that the expense for a single operation is about 40 
marks of $8.64 per short ton.
The total cost of cast steel, thus produced, per 
metric ton, is as follows:
For . Cost.
Amortization of cost of plant...............................$ 1.19
Raw materials, including additions, chrominum, etc ............................................................ 16.66
Electric current, including heating during inter
vals ............................................................................... 10.71
Renewal of magnesite lining................................... 2.85
Labor .............................................................................. 2.38
Electrodes ..............................................................................60
Water for cooling purposes...................................... .12
Total ...........................................................................$34.51
This amounts to $31.32 per short ton, and is mate
rially less than the cost of crucible steel.
h,BNr-NSED H -FE wUEA-bTA .bHAEDDP
The manufacturing firm notes in addition these 
advantages in the electric process, as compared with 
the old method: (1) Cheaper raw material can be
employed in the place of the more expensive Swedish 
iron formerly required; (2) in fusing quantities of a 
ton at a time it is possible to produce homogeneous 
masses of a distinct, well-defined grade; (3) the 
molten steel leaves the furnace at a much higher 
temperature than when prepared in crucibles, is 
therefore in a more liquid condition, and is easily 
transferred to ordinary ladles, preparatory to pouring 
into the molds of small castings.
These electric furnaces are arranged on the Stassano system, and are supplied in all sizes, for 
charges varying from 400 pounds to 10 tons, and are 
adapted for the fusion of metals of every kind. The

construction is shown by the designs forwarded (and 
filed for.inspection at the Bureau of Manufactures).
The furnace for cast steel is constructed of iron 
plates, heavily lined with magnesite bricks. Carbon 
electrodes enter by three openings on the sides, and 
are so adjusted as to terminate slightly above the 
surface of the molten metal, whereby the heat of the 
arc is absorbed almost entirely by the contents of 
the furnace, and but a small portion is radiated up
ward, to be reflected from the concave dome.
OTxTrS Nr, F&DTHry-FEb JDEDP
A thorough mixing of the component parts of a 
charge is effected by mounting the furnace on an 
axis, slightly inclined from the vertical. A steady 
revolution about this axis is maintained through a 
cogged connection, with a dynamo of 5 horsepower, 
the edge of the furnace resting on ball bearings. 
This rotation causes the lower layers to gradually 
rise to the top of the molten mass, and brings about a 
thoroughly uniform mixing. The electrode supports 
are enclosed in cylinders and surrounded by a cur
rent of cold water. These supports are in rigid 
connection with hydraulic cylinders, by means of 
which the movements of the electrodes are under 
perfect control.
A fusion requires 3hours to be complete; a 
further period of 1% hours is requisite for the re
moval in succession of phosphorus and sulphur, and 
the final deoxidation of the contents of the furnace. 
No interruption occurs in either the current of elec
tricity, or in the supply of water for cooling the elec
trode supports, while the furnace is in rotation. 
Special devices have been provided for both pur
poses.
The services of three workmen are required to 
conduct an electrical furnace, change electrodes, 
transport the raw materials, etc. Furnaces of the 
type in question are now being introduced in Ger
many for the treatment of other metals and alloys, 
and it is apparently only a question of time before 
the crucible processes hitherto in such general use 
will be completely superseded.

The concert of the Glee and Mandolin Clubs was 
a pleasant surprise to even the most sanguine be
lievers in our musical organization. The leaders 
have certainly found out what the audience at a Glee 
Club Concert expects and gave us that. All the num
bers were good, making it an inviduous task to pick 
the star feature.' Mr, Laithes solo probably is to be 
considered the best from a purely artistic standpoint, 
but other numbers on the program were just as 
heartily received. The Cat with a baritone, voice 
is something original and received a very enthusi
astic welcome. This concert far surpassed the one 
of last year and set a mark for future Glee Club en
deavor.

One of the essential things necessary for the suc
cess of a student body is a live class organization. 
Many young men have dropped out of the race, owing 
to the fact that they have become discouraged or 
have lost ambition. With a good active class organ
ization this would not have happened in many cases. 
The enthusiasm that can be aroused by a good 
class meeting would be a great benefit to all of us, it 
would help us with our studies and make us aim to 
put our class far ahead of any other in the school.
1913 has been very unfortunate in this respect, 
our class organization being as yet in its infancy, 
due, not to its age, but rather to a lack of the proper 
spirit.
Are we all dead ones, or did the licking 1912 gave 
us the night we tried to organize, scare us to death? 
At our present rate of progress, 1914 will make us 
look like prep, students.
To date we have adopted no class colors, have no 
constitution and by-laws, no money in our treasury, 
and our acquaintance in a social way has not been 
sufficient to enable us to know our officers by sight. 
If we wish to make our school a success, we have 
got to push this thing and push it hard. We cant 
depend on our officers for everythingthey need our 
co-operation, and the sooner we give it the better.

MgJw CONSERVATISM.
We are conscious of a sort of dissolution of par
ties, of a confusion of issues, of singular intersections 
of opinion and intermingling of impulse, and a nota
ble absence of* leadership, not leadership of political 
organizations, but leadership of constructive thought 
purpose of the country. There can be no mistaking 
the uneasiness of thoughtful men in the presence of 
such circumstances, or the universal desire that 
there should be some action upon the definite princi
ple. It is futile to talk of a return to anything. 
Our economic conditions are such as have hitherto 
been unknown. We must hark forward. The con
servation which should be sharply distinguished 
from this false and bastard conservatism, which is 
merely reactionary, is the conservatism which seeks 
a return to old a,nd well recognized principles, but a 
return to them in such a way as will give them a 
new interpretation and a new meaning for' the time 
we live in.From an address by President Woodrow 
. Wilson.

It is generally conceded that labor organizations 
are formed to fight capital, and indeed it may justly 
be so thought; and in turn the associations of em
ployers are formed to hold in check the seemingly 
exorbitant demands of trades unions. The members 
of these two distinct classes hold annual and various 
periodical meetings among themselves, to decide in 
which manner the next blow may be struck upon the 
other.
As long as this spirit of antagonism prevails just 
so long will there be an unsettled condition between 
labor and capital. To overcome this the employer 
and employe must each concede to the other, or, in 
other words, there should be conferences wherein 
both sides are represented. By these conferences
I do not mean that the officers of a manufacturing con
cern should treat with its employes to formulate a 
wage scale, but that representatives from the asso
ciations of various manufacturing industries, should 
meet in conference once every year with the various 
classes of labor employed by them, that a wage scale 
should be made, a wage scale which will 
prevail throughout ' the country and hold 
good' during the current year. The 
wage scale should be based upon the business 
done the past year, the amount of business booked 
for the coming year, and the industrial outlook. This 
would tend not only to do away with strikes wherein 
the employer, the employe, and the general public 
are put to much suffering and inconvenience, but 
would tend to bring about better economic conditions, 
wherein men would find better and more profitable 
employment, which would tend to increase produc
tion of goods by producing a demand therefore.
Today the greatest obstacle between labor and 
capital is lack of confidence inspired by the distant 
relation of these two great factions. These confer
ences would bring together men under conditions 
such as would be productive of good feeling and in
sure confidence by which one mans honor would 
hold him in duty bound to his word.

From the annual report of a German metal com

report says that 1907 was the most extreme year in 
regard to price fluctuations and price discrepencies 
of the metals, and it is worthy of note that the pro
duction costs in the most important mining districts 
have considerably increased, owing to higher wage 
scales and higher prices of all materials used in 
mining as also the gradual exhaustion of the leads 
and the more difficult task in working deeper.
