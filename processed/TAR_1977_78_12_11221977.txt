Kaplan foresees AMS changes
by Belinda Quan
Professor Robert S. Kaplan was pro
moted to Dean of the Graduate School of 
Industrial Administration (GSIA) to re
place Arnold R. Weber who became Pro
vost of CMU.
Kaplan, 37, joined the GSIA faculty in 
1968. He received his Bachelors and 
Masters degrees in electrical engineering 
at MIT and his Ph.D. in operations re
search at Cornell University. He has writ
ten several articles for books and profes
sional journals in accounting. He has 
researched the Social Security System and 
written a book entitled The Financial 
Crisis in the Social Security System.
AMS curriculum to change
Kaplan foresees some curriculum 
changes in the undergraduate AMS depart
ment, though the graduate program curri
culum will remain unchanged.
Kaplan formed a committee to review 
the AMS curriculum which he believes does 
not provide a broad education. Under
graduate business students are not studying 
enough science and humanities, Kaplan 
commented. He added that graduate stu
dents who teach a large percentage of AMS 
courses will continue to teach, however, 
the number of courses they teach will be 
reduced by eliminating Elements of In
dustrial Administration as a requirement. 
He also said that the AMS teacher ratings 
have improved.
GSIA produces "good products"
GSIA is one of the top schools of man
agement [in the country], ranked below 
only Harvard, Stanford, and the University 
of Chicago, Kaplan continued. He sees 
his role as maintaining the intellectual 
strength and high standards of GSIA. He 
stated that the quality of incoming stu
dents is improving and the teaching is bet
ter. GSIA is producing good products 
who are admitted to the other major busi
ness schools such as Harvard, and hired by 
major corporations, Kaplan said.
Kaplan assured that no fundamental 
changes will occur in the graduate program. 
The masters and doctoral programs will not 
be expanded beyond their present size. He 
would like to keep both small enough so 
that the faculty can focus individual at
tention on the students.
Kaplan stated that GSIA is offering 
more electives in economics and manage
ment. But the school will continue to pro
vide students with a strong analytical back
ground, in addition to experience in the 
functional areas such as theory and prac
tice.
The appointment of Kaplan brought 
mixed reactions. One GSIA student said 
that Kaplan was not receptive to student 
input and was not an eloquent spokesman 
for the school.
Dean Kaplan denied the charge that he 
was not open to student input; I dont 
know of any incident when I refused to see 
a student. An indication of his good rela
tionship with faculty and students was his 
award for best teaching, the first given by 
GSIA.
Furthermore, Kaplan said that he will 
provide leadership for GSIA and he is com
mitted to management while he appreciates 
the role of other disciplines, such as econo
mics.
Another student described Kaplan as 
young and diplomatic with students. He 
is an exceptional, professional man and 
brings an excellent reputation with him.Robert Kaplan, GSIA Dean, plans to drop Elements of Industrial Administration from the AMS 
curriculum.Bakke case will affect C-MAP
by Ed Frankenberry
The number of minority students gradjating with degrees in engineering and 
science from CMU has risen over the past 
two year period (1975-1977). And this 
fall, according to Dr. Marion Oliver, Exec
utive Director of the Carnegie-Mellon 
Action Project (C-MAP), admissions of 
minority students to CIT and MIS are 
again substantially higher than the national 
average, illustrating the success of the pro
gram.
Only 10% vote for senators
by Linda Deak
The Senate elections held November 17 
and 18 had only a 10% voter turnout. Past 
elections have had 20-25% voter turnouts. 
Reasons for this decline are varied, with 
both students and Senators offering 
explanations.
Chairperson of Senate, David Roussos 
felt that the apathy was connected to the 
lack of a referendum issue and that this 
election was not a Student Government 
election.
Ken Meinert, Chairperson of Rules, 
added, The low turnout may have been 
due to the small number of petitions 
presented. The only race for a seat was in 
H & SS.
Voters at the polls in Skibo (commuters 
and fraternity members) commented that 
they thought poll locations in Baker Hall 
and Doherty Hall were much more effect
ive. Commuters shouldnt have to make a 
trip to Skibo just to vote said one indiv
idual.
The fact that students could only vote 
in designated areas discouraged many pro
spective voters. As the Thursday election 
times coincided with the blood drive, many 
students stopped to vote at the Skibo poll, 
"but they were told to vote in either Morewood or Donner: they were dorm resi
dents.
Whatever the problem, the total 459 
votes cast constituted only 10.1% of full 
time students enrolled on the University.
C-MAP, which is financially indepen
dent from the University, offers a compre
hensive range of services to anyone who 
walks through the door, says Dr. Oliver. 
The name of the game is graduation, and 
C-MAP is designed to provide essentially 
whatever it takes to get the student 
through CMU.
A staff of 10 counselors handles 
problems students may encounter in a 
variety of areas. In addition to providing 
academic advice, free tutoring, and special 
courses and programs, C-MAP is concerned 
with career guidance, interview tips, sum
mer employment, test-taking workshops 
and personal counseling assistance.
Allowing blacks and other minorities 
meaningful access to higher education, 
so say civil libertarians, is a major step 
toward the goal of racial equality. C-MAP 
recruiters attempt to meet this challenge

Up against the fence
Angry Music Department students painted the Fence in protest of a department decision to drop the Music Education Option.
To bring attention to their protest, the students had repainted it several times during the week. There was some fear that freshmen would not be able 
to enter the music education program before it was cancelled. However, the Department now says the decision is effective for freshmen entering next fall.

CMU wins energy award
CMU has won an energy conservation award from Owens-Corning Corp., for modifications done on the air-conditioning system in Science Hall.
CMU contracted H.F. Lense Corp., an engineering contracting firm, to develop plans for the project. The modifications are in the air-condition
ing cooling system, and the air-handling systems. The cooling system's water is heated in the cooling process and this heat is now utilized. In the 
air-handling system already cooled air is re-circulated, thus cutting further energy use.
The project cost $900,000 and was undertaken over the summer. Joe McNally, a superintendent in the Physical Plant, estimates that the pro
ject will save CMU from $200,000 - $250,000 per year in energy costs.

story.
Room 50 Skibo 
12:00 Noon
Although it is not listed on the agenda, 
Director of Auxiliary Services, Bill Dillon, 
expects the City Planning Commission to 
approve the plans for the new dormitory 
on Margaret Morrison Street today.
According to City Planner Gary Reiswig, the new student housing project is not 
listed on Tuesdays agenda.
Dillon explained that the project just 
needs a rubber stamp, so it probably 
doesnt require any discussion. He con
tinued, saying that the Commisssion ap
proved the project in spirit October 11, 
but requested modifications for fire safety
standards. These modifications included 
adding a stairwell, and relocating the 
planned elevator location.
The project woul.d have been approved 
November 7, Dillon stated, but the 
Commission meeting was over before the 
dorm came up for discussion.
Since the dorm cannot be completed by 
September 1978, Dillon said that the 
project has lost its urgency. The Univer
sity plans to use some of the extra time it 
has gained on the project to find ways to 
cut construction costs. Dillon stated that 
the University would have forgone econ
omy to have the dorm completed on time.
C-Book still lacks funding
Because the C-Book still does not have 
enough advertising revenue to cover its 
publication costs, the chairman of the 
student directory, Jonathan Dwark, has 
asked the University to subsidize the book. 
Vice President for Business Affairs Richard 
Van Horn turned down the request.
Van Horn feels that subsidizing a stu
dent organization, such as A Phi O, the 
group which publishes C-Book, leads us 
into problems. He explained that student 
and University activities are and should 
remain separate. Whats the role of Stu
dent Senate if wo subsidize these activ
ities? Van Horn stated.
Subsidizing one organization will lead to 
other organizations desiring subsidies, Van 
Horn added.
Meantime, the C-Book is sitting at the 
printers and can be ready in two days, 
one person said. The same person added 
that A Phi 0 is considering raising the 
price of a C-Book from 25 cents to 50 
cents. However, it still wouldnt cover all 
the costs.
Without the C-Book to show all the 
Centrex exchanges recently adopted, the 
CMU operators are spending almost all 
their time giving out the new exchanges. 
This was supposed to be avoided when 
CMU switched over to Centrex.
Bill Dillon, Director of Auxiliary Serv
ices, said that Bell Telephone was planning 
to provide a C-Book like document as 
part of its Centrex service. But that cannot 
happen until Student Centrex phones are 
installed.

Several topics were discussed at the last 
SDC meeting, held November 13, ranging 
from-the Donner mailroom, to the Spring 
Carnival Booth, to the student disciplinary 
code. ^1
In his administrative report, Corey 
Chase announced that the mailroom in 
the basement of Donner Hall will now be 
locked at 11 PM every night, due to the 
fact that many boxes have been broken 
into and mail has been stolen. Also, a 
phone booth located in that area had been 
ripped out of the wall.
Several SDC reps protested the mo#, 
pointing out that many students use the 
phones located in the mailroom, especially 
after 11. Chase sympathized with their 
position, but explained that nothing could 
be done because protecting the mail was 
of highest priority.
Chase also announced that he would 
have in his office, copies of the Pittsburgh 
papers on weekdays and of the New Yc^ 
Times on weekends, for anyone who is 
interested.
Morewood Resident Director Claudia 
Geraci announced that donors in the 
blood drive would be treated to a dessert 
by Ludwig, rather than a dinner as was 
previously announced. She also com
mended the men of 7E Morewood for the%fine painting job they did on their wafe.
In his committee report, Spring Car
nival Booth Chairman Eric Huhn reported 
that Interest in booth has hit an all time 
low. Ive spoken with Sam [Grego] 
about forgetting about booth completely, 
because there just isnt enough interest, 
space, tools, or money. There were several 
people interested at the beginning of the 
year, but theyve all disappeared. Cour^l. 
voted to table this issue until January, 
when interest in Spring Carnival would 
presumably be higher.
Fire and Safety Committee chairman 
Tim Roscoe expressed his concern about 
the failure of some fire alarms in More
wood to operate correctly during the 
boiler blowup. Roscoe, however, was not 
able to contact Bob Anderegg, due to 
fact that Andereggs phone number 
unlisted. Claudia Geraci said that SDC 
should definitely exert pressure on 
Anderegg to install effective fire alarms.
President Sam Grego announced the 
crime report for October. There were 2 
assaults, 23 thefts, 3 false fire alarms,
2 fires, and 1 indecent exposure. Total 
personal losses amounted to $820 
University property losses amounted 
$1,877.

Senate murmurs
by Linda Deak
Members of the CMU Baseball Club 
crowded into Room 45 last Wednesday 
to hear the positive verdict on their $5,650 
budget proposal. A few senators would 
like to see the Senates previous decision 
reversed on approving the Baseball Club 
as a supported organization, but the club 
will be funded in the amount they re
quested.
Much of the controversy surrounding 
the Baseball Club stems from an inter
pretation of the by-laws in Senates new 
fiscal policy. As it stands, Senate did 
not choose to recognize any recreational 
or social organizations as supported 
(funded). During the November 16 meet
ing, Ken Meinert, Chairperson of Rules, 
proposed that the by-laws be ammended 
to read that recreational organizations 
may be allocated funds. This was not 
accepted by a two-thirds majority in 
Senate, which sent the proposal back to 
rules. Dean Swank remarked that by 
omitting recreational organizations, Senate 
is going against the trustees agreement 
that one purpose of the Activities Fee 
was to support such organizations. Roussos 
argued that it was Senates responsibility 
to decide which groups would be allo
cated funds.
After the heated discussion, Senate 
managed to squeeze in a few announce
ments. John Lubon stated that Mike 
Alston is the new Treasurer to Senate. 
Amy Boyle has been chosen as Chair
person of Student Government Fund, 
which covers unique activities not 
falling under the responsibility of Ac
tivities Board. Don Simon recommended 
that Ann Witchner fill the vacancy on the 
Board of Trustees to the Student Gov
ernment Corporation.
Roussos, at the suggestion of Senator 
Carl Fetteroll, has submitted a letter 
to President Cyert revealing Senates op
position to the Music Departments recent 
announcement to drop the Music Educa
tion Option. He also added that the Senate 
objects to the fact that students were 
not consulted before the decision was 
publicized.
One senator suggested that Academic 
Affairs investigate the possibility of having 
classes cancelled during pre-registration.
There will be no meeting this week 
because of Thanksgiving break; the next 
meeting will be held November 30 at 
6:00 in the Wherett Room.
AMSers get 'shaft
by Paul Henderson
The Mathematics Department cancelled 
the Higher Mathematics for the Social and 
Managerial Sciences I & II courses. This 
cancellation mainly affects Economics and 
AMS majors, for whom these two courses 
are required for the fulfillment of their 
major.
Consequently, the Economics Depart
ment requires B.S. to take Calculus III 
and more advanced math electives, in 
place of Higher Math I & II. AMS has 
dropped the Higher Math II requirement, 
but students must take Calculus III.
Students are upset because Calculus III 
is mainly an engineering course. In fact, 
the text for a large part of the class is Ad
vanced Engineering Mathematics by Kreysig.
The Mathematics Department has been 
asked to begin placing emphasis on sol
ving economic models but when a Calculus
III lecturer was asked if any such models 
would be solved, he said no, adding, 
frankly, I think those people [econ. and 
AMS majors] are getting the shaft.
C-MAP provides minorities academic aid
continued from page 1
by first attending minority college fairs 
and high schools to generate applicants.
Associate Director of Admissions, 
Sanford Rivers explains that minority stu
dents receive no special consideration when 
admission decisions are made. We have 
not set aside a specific number of spaces 
for minority students. Race is not a fac
tor, he says, since the university is not 
allowed to ask a students race . . . [and] 
if a students does not identify himself as 
a minority student, we have no way of ever 
knowing that. Students admitted to CMU 
are expected, on basis of grades and SAT 
scores, to have a 2.5 or better QPA.
This creates a problem, as Oliver puts 
it, since minority candidates typically rank 
lower when predictions of academic 
performance are computed. The equation 
excludes blacks (and other minorities), 
he says, which has made it necessary to 
devise other means of evaluating the per
formance of black candidates.
The solution lies in the second phase of 
the C-MAP program: summer seminars, 
through the August Program, students 
come to CMU for a month prior to the 
start of classes to take college-level courses 
which stress science and math and intro
duce them to university life. A similar 
program Pre-engineering began last year 
for high school juniors. Students who per
form well and seem to have 2.5 capability 
that testing did not show before become 
freshmen. In the case of juniors, they are 
given early admission.
In this way, Oliver says, students who 
are known to have been successful, 
based on their summer experience, are 
admitted. Of the 50+ blacks admitted this 
fall, only two would have been accepted 
without considering their summer per
formance. The predictions [of academic

success]  for the remainder of the black 
freshmen would have kept them out 
without the August Program.
Education, Oliver feels, is the key. 
As unemployment among black teenagers 
swells, the number of job opportunities 
in engineering and science continues to 
grow. Oliver sees the C-MAP program as 
means of filling this need with skilled 
blacks skilled to meet the demand. Equal 
educational opportunity and marketable 
skills lead to equal employment oppor
tunity.
Rivers agrees that higher education is 
one way to achieve upward mobility and
The results
getting a degree from this institution 
[for blacks] is worth its weight in gold.
The nine-year-old C-MAP program con
tinues to expand its coverage and hopes to 
branch out to mathematics, AMS and eco
nomics.
However, if the Bakke case, against 
racial priority programs, is won in the 
Supreme Court, Oliver feels C-MAP would 
be hurt, [if the decision for Bakke 
comes,] in the worst possible way, then 
undoubtedly undergraduate recruitment 
would be affected. Either you have a 
[projected] 2.5 QPA or better, or you are 
not admitted, he stated.

(.Hello? Anybody out there?')
Letting other people make decisions that affect us di
rectly is an easy way out; its also dangerous. The day will 
come when we realize that, in our apathy, weve lost any 
. chance to direct the course of our own futures.
Is this just jargon that weve all heard thousands of 
times before?
No. Students at CMU have been sitting on their but
tocks now. since September, whining and whimpering over 
numerous injustices done to them, yet not doing a whit 
to improve their lots.
First it was the Morewood desk incident. Probably not 
one student believed getting rid of full-time desk monitors 
was a good idea, but aside from the half-hearted attempts 
made by two or three people, nothing was done. We didn t 
work together, we didnt combine our separate angers into 
a larger, more powerful force, and as a result, nothing 
changed.
Then it was the increase in parking lot fees. Students 
gasped collectively with rage, but then? Nothing.
Later on, it was the housing situation. Some people 
didnt have showers, some people didnt have doors, and 
some people didnt even have rooms. Recently, some stu
dents have been given that now-infamous ultimatum to 
cough up some extra dough or move out.
Has there been any attempt to band together and really 
put up a fight? No.
Speaking of housing, the word is that there will be 
enough pext year for those who want it. The word is also 
that the new dorm wont be ready before January of 1978. 
And President Cyert has said that he reajly doesnt care for 
using off-on-campus housing like Webster Hall. So, has 
anybody ever asked exactly how they plan to house us? 
No. Will anybody ever ask? Probably not until its too late. 
If their plans dont please us, too bad for us.
Now its the music education option. Finally, students 
are doing something, though it may again be too late to 
change things. But think carefully, music majors: were
there any hints that something like this was going to hap
pen? Changes over the past few years in the curriculum, 
perhaps an increase in the number of repertory courses 
offered and a decline in the quality of the education 
courses? Wasnt that the time, back then, to ask ques
tions?
And there are vague mutterings in the wind that all ed
ucation programs at CMU are being gradually phased out. 
Anybody have any questions theyd like to ask about this? 
Doesnt anybody care? Or isnt there anybody out there 
at all?
Judging from the recent Student Senate elections, the 
answer to that last question must be no. Rather, the answer 
is a resounding silence. For only 10.1% of those eligible to 
vote did so. That means that if you live in E-tower, 5 peo
ple on your floor voted. In all of Welch, 6 people voted. 
Out of the 30 people living in one wing of Donner Hall,
3 people voted. In Morewood Gardens, only 2 people on 
every floor voted.
Congratulations to those of you who didnt vote. You 
are now being represented by 20 people, who were voted 
in by a scant 459 students out of a total student body of 
about 4500.
What a pitiful display of waste and stupidity. It would 
make so much more sense if we used Senate the way it 
should be used, as a Mason between the students and the 
administration. Through Senate, we could express our dis
satisfaction. Through Senate, we could funnel our com
plaints, as a united body, to the administration.
But how long will it take us to get organized and uni
fied? Thanksgiving is in two days; soon after we 71 leave for 
Christmas vacation. Then weve got the spring semester; 
but time passes so quickly when youre busy studying, 
doesn t it?
Cmon, people. Counting today, there are 95 class days 
left to this year. Theres enough time left to change a few 
things.

There's nothing wrong with 
patriotism
Editor;.
In response to SJSs letter of 
November 1,1977.
It seems to me that the very 
device you plan to combat com
munism is communism itself. In 
addition to having patriotic 
songs crammed down our ears 
continuously throughout the 
day and forcing us to pledge 
a flag, why not have us carry our 
little red books around, also?
Life, liberty and the pursuit of 
happiness, are some of the prin
ciples our government was found
ed on. Yet, by building better 
bombs and eliminating contin
ents we take these freedoms 
away from others. Remember, 
ALL men are created equal, 
and we have no right to deny 
other people these rights.
If all people were registered 
Republicans, we would have a 
party system of government. So 
does communist Russia, so whats 
the difference?
In conclusion, I do want to 
state that there is nothing at all 
wrong with patriotism. But do 
remember that our forefathers 
and early leaders faith in God 
played a very big role in making 
our country great. And we must 
also remember that patriotism, as 
well as the overall quality of our 
once great country deteriorated 
after many of us abandoned the 
God who made it so.

Music Ed: a model program
Editor:
Following is a statement of po
sition by the honorary music fra
ternity of CMU. Copies of the 
statement have been sent to Pres
ident Cyert, Dean Midani, and 
Robert Page.
The brothers of Phi Mu Alpha 
believe that the Music Education 
Program at Camegie-Mellon Uni
versity should be continued. The 
program, in keeping with the de
partments strong philosophy of 
professionalism, has been a very 
successful discipline. Through its
ranks have passed the finest musi
cians the department has had to 
offer, as well as the most inspir
ing music educators in the 
country.
The Music Education Option 
has been singled out as a model 
program for music education in 
the United States by the Music 
Educators National Conference.
Performance and education at 
CMU have proven to be compat
ible disciplines, enriching each 
other through interaction, and ad
ding to the total experience of the 
student.
A degree in music education 
from CMU is not just a sheepskin, 
either. The high regard for the 
program by prospective employ
ers is evidenced by an excellent 
record of job placement at a time 
when the market is flooded by 
educators of all subjects.
One purpose, and truly a cor
nerstone of Phi Mu Alpha, is the 
advancement of music in America 
in all fields, education as well as 
performance and composition. 
The brothers believe that the de
cision to drop Music Education 
from the Department of Music is

Alumni apathy
Editor:
I am writing as a previous 
member of the Kiltie Band. I was 
one of those significant number of 
students outside of Fine Arts 
that chose to be part of the large 
ensemble experience. I would still 
be part of it if it werent for con
flicting lab courses required by 
my own department.
One of the aspects that attract
ed me to this school was the fact
that a few outlets did exist for 
non-Fine Arts majors in this 
highly structured, professional 
school. Two examples were 
Scotch n Soda and the Kiltie 
Band. In fact, my second choicc 
of schools was a large state uni 
versity (not in Pennsylvania) that 
included an excellent marching 
band. When attempts were made 
to phase out that band just a 
few years ago due to the lack of 
university funds, alumns eagerly 
donated more than enough money 
to cover the bands expenses. 
This included uniform & equip
ment, maintenance as well as 
traveling expenses.
Which reminds me of another 
point.
I may be totally wrong, but I 
was under the impression that 
the once-annual trip by the
Kiltie Band to Carnegie Hall in 
New York was an alumn-drawing 
tool. Although I realized that few 
undergraduates outside of the 
band could even recognize either 
the tune or words to our Fight 
Song, it is another thing to see 
a group of loyal alumns cheering 
along with the traditional closing 
number.
Im sorry to say that my over
all impression is the realization 
that the seething apathy of this 
school is not totally student
generated.

To laugh or cry?
Editor;
As a part-time graduate stu
dent, I am on the CMU campus 
only one evening per week, I 
enjoy reading the TARTAN and 
usually take a few copies backANNOI INCEMENTS8XLASSIF1EQAD5
to my office the next morning 
and pass them around.
The front page of the No
vember 1 issue featured the fol
lowing two headlines over sep
arate articles: Tuition goes to
$3700, and Concern arises 
over student illiteracy.
It seems to me that these are 
a sad indictment of our times 
Each headline has its absurd and 
its tragic, aspects; I dont know 
whether to laugh or cry. Both, 
together on the same page, must 
herald a new nadir of nescienty.

Thanks for the blood
Editor:
I should like to express my ap
preciation to the student body of 
Carnegie-Mellon University for 
their participation in the Blood 
JDrivj^cond^
on November 16, 1977. 354 stu
dents presented themselves to give 
blood on either Wednesday or 
Thursday. Because of the lack of 
personnel supplied by tne Central 
Blood Bank approximately SO 
more weie turned away.
Fifty percent more blood was 
donated than last year.
It is easy to forget the contin
uing need of patients in the citys 
hospitals for this vital element. I 
want to thank all of those who 
chose this means to show their 
commitment to the community 
which they share, and their sense 
of responsibility to the University 
community.
I should also like to extend my 
special appreciation to the many 
student organizations who contri
buted time and effort assisting 
Miss Geraci to make the drive 
successful.

countries that collectively operate more 
than 4,500 hostels (simple, dorm-style 
places to stay) worldwide, where travelers 
pay $2.00-$3.00 a night.

Waiting in line
Students in AMS line unite
by Linda Deak
The AMS stairwell was acclaimed the 
hottest AM spot on campus, by the AMS 
majors, double majors and curious by
standers who were pre-registering last Wed. nesday. I happened to be one of the lucky 
persons in attendance.
Fellow students were quite cruel, chuck
ling and grinning at my expression when I 
had to descend the 40 stair steps to the 
basement. After the first hour, however, a 
comraderie developed between the step 
dwellers. Only during that special morn
ing could an announcement, OB I is still 
open to full blooded AMS people, draw 
cheers and backslaps. Those people with 
course listing pamphlets became exception
ally popular. After every decree from the 
omnipotent voice on the second floor that 
announced course closings, there was a 
mad flipping through the book to find 
alternative courses. I had never altered my 
life so many times as I did in those two 
hours. My only consolation was to hear 
that F. Lee Bailey had to schedule the 
night accounting course also.
There was a running contest to be the 
individual who heard the best remark from 
a newcomer who learned that the line
formed in the basement. Being stationed 
in the basement doorway, I happened to 
catch such priceless ones as:
Didnt you think that you were going 
to knock them dead by getting here 
early?
Christ, I cant believe this, I only want 
one course.
Theyre going to have to build an ad
dition to GSIA just for registration. 
By the time I get upstairs Ill probably 
have to drop the course before I take it. 
The more impatient refused to wait in 
the stairwell, saying, Im just going up
stairs.
' Im not getting in this line, I think Ill 
take gym instead.
I never did find out if the AMS depart
ment was giving out something for free. 
If they were, I guess they ran out, along 
with course offerings, just as I reached the 
registration desk. The secretary shook her 
head sadly as I handed her an OB I card. 
Im sorry, but you cant take this course 
next semester unless your family is related 
to the AMS department. I figured that I 
could always return in the spring. Who 
knows, they might have refreshments and 
hire a band to entertain the throngs next 
semester.
Noise controls proposed
continued fronl Dage 2
Dean Swank was present at the meeting 
to discuss the disciplinary code. He also 
urged students to, Be aware of the new 
smoking regulations in Doherty 2210. 
We really want cooperation, because we 
were in jeopardy of. losing our right to 
show films there because of the mess 
the room is in on Monday mornings.
Swank commented extensively on the 
recent cement, defacing incident in which a 
student was fined $600 and given a years 
probation. Swank said that, the student 
was found guilty, with mitigating cir
cumstances. The severity of his sentence 
was modified, and he chose to file an 
appeal. This appeal will be heard before the 
disciplinary committee. Questions were 
raised about the TARTANS reporting of 
the case. So long as the article does not 
name the person involved, its okay, 
said Swank. Council questioned why the 
TARTAN chose to report on this par
ticular case only, and also why it was not 
made clear that the case was under appeal.
In the future, said Swank, I will ask 
the TARTAN not to put cases on the 
front page.
On the topic of noise in the dorms, 
Swank said, Noise regulations in the 
dorms are difficult to enforce because 
there is no specific definition of what 
constitutes excessive noise. A preliminary 
definition is that anything penetrating 
beyond a second room is unreasonable. 
After midnight, (and on weekends, after
1 or 1:30) any sound that can be heard in 
the next room is unreasonable. We are 
considering the possibility of a citation 
for noise, something like a traffic ticket, 
to be enforced possibly by RAs, security, 
or individual people. The citation system 
will probably be put into effect at the 
beginning of next semester, and will carry 
a $20-25 fine. Well see how it goes, 
says Swank, and I will be open to any 
suggestions for modifications.
SDC meetings are held every Sunday 
at 6:30 in Room 100, Skibo. The Campus 
Community is invited to attend.

This highly fictitious writing deals with the 
evergrowing* indulgence of Americans in "the 
seven deadly sins/' Two all beef patties, special 
sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions on a sesame 
seed bun.
The Big Mac Attack has placed McDonalds in 
numerous strategic locations throughout the 
United States. Dubious sources have discovered 
that McDonald's goal is to have one of their fran
chises for each U.S. citizen by the Mid 1980s.
It has been learned that McDonalds has been 
linked with various undercover operations. In an 
attempt to speed up their goal of one McDonalds 
to every person, the golden arch boys tried to re
duce the population, thus wasting less time and 
money on construction. The method employed 
was ingenious: McDonald Land Glasses were 
printed with toxic lead paint. However, the plot 
failed, because when McDonalds calculated the 
dosage of paint needed to be fatal, they consid
ered only the wet paint; when it dried, it was con
siderably less effective. There was also a rumor 
circulating that the U.S. government has placed 
LSD in Egg McMuffins, but no facts, as yet, have 
been turned up.
A serious blow to McDonald's domestic rela
tions has also been reported. In a recent Press 
Conference, Public Relations Man, Ronald Mc
Donald was quoted as saying, "We're, bigger than 
Christ!" Reports have come in from all over the 
country. Notable is the reaction in the deep 
south. There, clergymen have led anti-McDonald 
rallies and have shown their resentment by burn
ing huge piles of Big Macs in much the same way 
they burned Beatle records when John Lennon 
made a similar comment.
As 1984 draws closer, it has become increasing
ly clear that we have something to worry about. 
It looks as though there will be an omnipresent 
force checking our every move. However it will 
not be a computer. This is a warning. Big Mac is 
watching you!

A parody of the Ernest Hemingway "Nick

by Bill Tinsley
Tim aid I entered the saloon, but the bartend
er didn't notice. We sat at the bar, but the bar
tender didn't notice. Tim tried not to look ner
vous, so he picked up a toothpick and stuck it in 
his mouth. The bartender didn't notice.
"Uh...l'll have a shot of bourbon," Tim 
shouted. The bartender glared at him, then went 
back to drying glasses.
"I said, 'I'll have../"
I interrupted Tim. "How much is the free 
lunch?" No response. "Excuse me..."
The bartender picked up a sign and gave it to 
us. It said: "I am not the bartender." I was going 
to give it back, but he motioned for us to turn it 
over. There was more writing: "I am also a deaf 
mute." Tim laughed, and the mute hit him over 
the head with a beer mug. I decided it was time 
we left.
It was cold and dark out, and Tim slipped in 
some horse residue as he stepped off the porch. ! 
had noticed an abundance of it in this town. Even 
our lunch had looked like it.
We walked to the train station. We had decided 
to leave on the next train. We walked into the 
station restaurant and sat in a booth. Across from 
us were five whores, also waiting for the train. 
Next to them, at the counter, sat a pretty debut
ante with her duck. The duck was eating cheese
cake out of her hand.
The negro cook came out of the kitchen and 
came to the table and asked, "Either of you boys 
...sailors?"
Tim and I looked at each other. "No."
"Well, no diff'rince. Whatchoo want?"
Tim licked his lips and said, "I'll have a shot of 
bourbon."
"Are you jivin' me?! How old 'you, boy? 
Lem me see you I.D."
"Alright, so I'm seventeen. How about giving 
me a break?"
I didn't hear any more of their conversation. I 
just stared at the whores. I was feeling pretty
horny. One of the whores had auburn hair, and it 
reminded me of our lunch. Two had red, curly 
hair, and wore very chic but stretched out, frilly 
dresses. The other two had blonde hair  a yellow 
shade that one might find, if he looked closely, at 
the trunk of a tree. One of the blondes noticed 
my staring, and came and sat in my lap.
"Feelin' sort of.Jow, honey? How about, uh," 
She licked her lips, "restin' up in a bed...I've got 
one reserved on the train, and I'm sure there'd 
be room..."
I looked past her at the other whores. They 
were having a conversation with the debutante. 
The debutante never responded. She just sat with 
her hand extended, for the duck to eat from.
"Hey ice-face, if you're interested, the cook 
that works here would be good in..." The whore 
started laughing, more like cackling, before she 
finished her sentence.
I looked at the lady in my lap. "What's your 
name?"
She said, "Cory."
"And what are your friends' names?"
"Well, there's Patty, LaVerne, Bertha, and 
Marjorie."
The cook came back with Tim's order. When 
he placed the coffee on the table, he winked at 
Tim.
Tim said, "What?"
The cook said, "I said," He winked at Tim 
again, this time more exaggerated.
"Get out of here!" Tim threw the coffee in his 
face.
"Makes no diff'rince to me, boss. Taint no 
stain on my facethey's the same color!" The 
whore named Bertha cackled again. "What's 
you laughin' at you big mound o' suet?"
The one named LaVerne said, "Don't you talk 
to Brenda like that..."
Bertha said, "It's Bertha, chicken-scratch."
"Whatever...Just don't talk to her like that."
The cook said, "Just go wherever you're 
goingthe black lagoon, probably."
Patty rose off her stool. "We are not. We're 
going to Hollywood to become actresses."
The cook laughed. "Good luck."
"It don't matter about luck. Stewart Ketchup 
is a big man down there, and we are close friends,' 
Marjorie said. Although she was not terribly goodlooking, she did have a nice nose. I always looked 
first at a girl's nose. It seemed I could always tell 
what a girl was like by her nose.

Bertha spoke up again. "Steve Ketchup and 
you are good friends?! Why, honey, you know 
that's just an outright lie. It's me that Steve-baby 
likes. Why, I can remember when..."
"Liar! You make up all those stories about him
and youand most are based on my experiences. 
Stewart once even said that I was the most fun in 
bed he'd ever had!"
I looked at Marjorie. She was fairly prettyfor 
a whore. She was at least prettier than the other 
four. I wondered if I should believe Stewart 
Ketchup.
Bertha looked infuriated. "You goddam sonof-a-bitch, don't you try to take credit away from 
me!" She leapt towards Marjorie and began 
pulling her hair and scratching her face.
"Help! Police! Get this maniac off of me! 
Bertha....BERTHA!!!..." With more strength than 
I gave her credit for, Marjorie pushed Bertha off 
of her. The force was so great that Bertha was 
hurled through the window facing the tracks, and 
her body rolled down onto the tracks. We all 
heard Bertha's very last screech, but it was 
drowned out by the whistle of the express train 
passing through on track one, where Bertha lay.
0 Cory screamed, jumped off my lap, and ran to the 
window. Tim looked at me.
"Let's get out of here," he said, "Let's get the 
hell out of here, now."
"But Tim, I wanna stay with these lovely 
ladies. Besides, our train doesn't come for another 
ten minutes."
"I don't care. I'm leaving."
God, was I horny. I just couldn't leave without 
being fulfilled.
The cook came rushing out of the kitchen.
"Lawdy, lawdy! Someone c'mere, quick! This 
lady just stumbled into the kitchen, and she's 
having a baby!" He ran back into the kitchen, 
with Patty and LaVerne following him.
"Boil some chicken soup," said Patty.
The two other whores, Marjorie and Cory, left 
> the room, gone to remake their faces.
"Wait!" I cried, "Don't leave me!..."
My cries were unheeded. I was desperate, 
had to do something.
"I've got it!" I rushed to the kitchen door. 
"Hey, nigger-you doing anything? I mean, if you 
want to..."
At this moment, two men walked into the res
taurant. They wore overcoats that were too tight 
around their chests.
"Who are you?" I asked.
"We're Martin and Bartin, a vaudeville team. 
Never mind the introductions. Where's Holy 
Anderson?" The man seemed gruff.
"Who?" I said.
"Oh, gee. Sorry," the second man said, 'This 
must be the wrong place." They left.
Tim stood up, taking the silverware and the 
sugar packages and the napkins and said, "C'mon. 
I'm leaving." And he left. I reluctantly followed, 
unfulfilled, but before I shut the door, I looked 
once more at the almost empty room.
The debutante sat on the stool with her empty 
hand extended, for her duck to eat cheesecake 
from.
by Jeffrey Zaslow
Parents saw the Hebrew school creation,
As removing their home teaching burden.
But forced religious appreciation,
Caused the children's minds and hearts to harden.
So it was not odd that there came the time,
When all of the children were rounded up 
And told to mourn the despicable crime,
"When all of the children were rounded up."
"Yes rounded up and starved and gassed and 
burned.
Not long ago. Jewish children like you!"
But these fattened students laughed, heads

My friends I confess that I think I'm in heaven, 
When I see the square root of fifty seven.
Most other numbers I find I abhor,
Like the*cube and radical of sixty four.
I can't understand why so many hold true,
To the basics as zero, three, or two.
These folks are nerds, and just don't have fun, 
Especially those who will only use one.
To me, and to most other people I've found,
One is the most boring number around.
Most of all times when you've got to grow.
But adding by ones is much much too slow.
And using exponents, although they never do,
A one never changes, not even to two.
I've tried to change them, and teach then of six, 
But they say they won't hear of my radical tricks. 
So if they want to lead such conservative lives,
Do not blame me that they'll never know fives. 
Then these are others, who just to save face,
Claim they are using a whole different base.
These people say, and then claim they're great, 
That sixteen is twenty, when using base eight.
So to them I just turn, and I say that that's fine, 
But the only real base, is one more than nine.
Yet I must say the folks who most aggravate me, 
Are the people who think of a trillion and three. 
As for me when I think of a number that high,
A trillion's a trillion, the three can pass by.
Yet I've friends of all kinds, some who love prisms. 
My brothers and sisters enjoy the logarithms.
And my mother who always said I should be fair, 
Was partial to numbers of any perfect square.
But the favorite to me which I'll never ignore,
Is seven point five four nine eight three four four.

by Steve Lammert
(based on The Deacon's Masterpiece by Oliver 
Wendell Holmes, with apologies)
Have you fieard of the car made by Chevrolet, 
That was built in such a businesslike way;
It's warranty ran for a year, to the day,
And then, of a sudden, itah, but stay,
And I'll tell you the rest without delay.
Sending its owner into fits,
Frightening investors out of their wits,
Have you ever heard of that, I say?
Nineteen ndrcd and seventy-eight:
Ralph Nader's groupies were all doing great, 
Earning praise from consumers (and corporate
hate).
That was the year when the stock exchangewell, 
Hit a recession, and down she fell,
And Panama's army was beaten like hell,
Left with the Communist powers on the swell? 
Twas in seventy-eight, then, on New Year's Day, 
That G.M. released its brand-new Chevrolet.
Now, in building of autos, I tell you what,
Repairs under warranty cost G.M. a lot,
For hub, wheel, or gas tank, for springs or grilles, 
For seat belts, or windows, or No Brakes on Hills, 
For screw, bolt, or steering,whatever you will,
If it's guaranteed, G.M. must foot the bill,
Above or below, or within or without,
And that's the problem, without a doubt:
A car breaks down 'fore the contract runs out.
But G.M.'s prez swore (as presidents swear,
With deleted expletives everywhere)
He would build a car to delight the town 
And foil competition for miles around;
Long as warranty held, it musn't break down. 
"For," said the Board, "it is mighty plain 
That replacing parts free is a great fiscal strain; 
And the remedy for this, as we suggest,
Is to make every part as strong as the rest."
So the president ordered his research folk 
To build him a car that, while under the yoke 
Of new auto warranty, couldn't be broke,
Such a car would at first cause a public thrill; 
Imagine, an auto with no repair ills!
The transmission was built so that gears couldn't
seize,
The frame of aluminum, light as you please,
But strong as steel for things like these;
The chassis was welded to halt any busting,
And sent off to Zeibart, There'd be no rusting! 
Never an oxide had marred that stuff,
And the factory men polished 'til no spot was
rough,
The blunt ends were sanded and curried and
buffea;
Gear and muffler, bolt and screw.
Spring, rod, axle, and oilpan, too,
Steel of the finest, bright and blue;
Interior roomy, long and wide;
Silver-toned paint job (blue inside),
Carpet was deep pile, hand-woven and dyed.
That was the process he put them through, 
'There!" said the president, "Now she'll do!"
Do! I tell you, I rather guess 
She was a wonder, and nothing less!
Chrysler sold out, Ford went grey,
Japanese imports faded away,
American Motors where were they?.
But there rode the error-free Chevrolet,
Running as well as on New Year's Day!
February; it came and found
That beautiful Chewy strong and sound.
March and April, and then came May; 
"Wonderful car!" they were heard to say.
June, July, August, September came;
Running as usual; much the same.
October, November pass away,
And then comes Christmas, and NEW YEARS
DAY.
Little of all we value here 
Wakes after even a single year 
Without both feeling and looking queer.
In fact, there's nothing that keeps its youth,
But Carol Burnett and a jug of vermouth.
(This is a moral I just made up;
Take it or leave it it rhymes, so shut up!)
The warranty runs out on New Year's Day
There are traces of age in that grand Chevrolet,
A general flavor of mild decay,
Planned obsolescence, as some might say.
But no repairs, for G.M.'s art
Had made it so like in every part
That there wasn't a chance (yet) for trouble to
start.
For the wheels were just as strong as the frame,
And the body as strong as the company name, 
And the panels just as strong as the door,
And the engine mount neither less nor more,
(But a little device installed under the floor 
Was counting the days, and read THREE SIXTYFOUR,
So that as a whole, it was past a doubt 
In another hour, the warranty runs out!).
New Year's Day, nineteen and seventy-nine!
This morning, Ralph Nader is looking just fine. 
Now, Big Business, get out of the way!
Here comes Ralph in that grand Chevrolet 
Which has run without fail for a year to the day. 
"Tally ho!" shouted Nader off went they.
Ralph was working his latest test,
He'd dissolved I.T.T. (and G.M. was next);
But suddenly, he flet perplexed.
All at once, the car stood still,
Right near Congress on Capitol Hill.
First a shiver, and then a thrill,
And then a sound like a pneumatic drill,
And Nader, his brain in a whirl, could derive 
What the genius of G.M. had come to contrive, 
As the hidden device now read THREE SIXTYFIVE!
 What do you think Ralph Nader found,
Whney he got up and stared around?
His 'unbreakable' car in a heap or mound,
As if it had been to the mill and ground!
You see, as Ralph did, if you're not a dunce.
How it was set to disintegrate all at once,
On New Year's Day, January the first,
When the warranty died and G.M.'s bubble burst.
End of that wonderful Chevrolet
Business is buisness. That's all I say.

Tom Magulusi was at the Hunt Library, first 
floor, trying to do the reading necessary for him 
to understand Organic Chemistry. As he read and 
re-read sentences over and over again without 
understanding them, one could almost feel the 
frustration, disappointment and hatred building 
up in Tom. And just before he dragged his 6' 1" 
175 pound frame away from his reserve room 
table, if you looked into his flaming eyes you 
could see, yes, actually see the emotional turmoil 
rushing through him. Of course if one didn't see it 
when he got up, all that one would have to do is 
stick around for about another 20 minutes. Then 
it couldn't be missed.
His rest break started out normal enough. He 
walked up past the entrances to Hunt Library and 
checked Mrs. Rosemeir's office.
"Good," he thought, "nobody there."
Next he went across the first floor to the ele
vator. He waited for it, and when it arrived he 
hit the emergency stop, thus jamming it. He ther 
looked into the Technical Processes room, where 
as in the case of Mrs. Rosemeir, everyone was out 
to lunch. Tom then passed the unused filing 
cabinets and moved into the Reference Room. 
In this room he noticed a sleepy-eyed workstudy assistant, and two hard working kids. 
"Fools," he thought. Finally he ended up sitting 
in the newspaper room. He sized up what he'd be 
up against. Two girls talking their heads off next 
to him. A pale guy reading a month-old issue 
of Sports Illustrated across from him. Behind the 
desk there was only two elderly women, and two 
more work-study assistants. The Reserve Room, 
where he had been reading, contained six oiher 
people, 4 male and 2 female. While he double
checked his numbers mentally, a young lady 
entered the library and sat down in the newspaper 
room to read the "Post." Tom knew that: 1) his 
total opposition numbered 17 and, 2) the young 
lady who just came into the library would be the 
last to enter for quite some time. Getting up, 
he moved into action.
He shuffled over to the newspaper rack and 
removed a tattered Post-Gazette. He then took a 
paperback from his hip pocket, and holding the 
former in his left hand and the latter in his 
right, walked up to the desk, addressing one of 
the two elderly ladies.
"Excuse me, but are you the head of the Circ 
desk?"
"Why, yes I am," she answered.
"Well, I want you to do exactly what I tell you 
to do, and nobody will get hurt, O K.?"
Realizing that Tom was perfectly serious, and 
therefore in a terrified state, the librarian 
managed to shake her head yes. *
"Good," Tom said in a calm voice. "Now, go 
into the reference room and tell the assistants and 
dudes in there to step out here for a minute for 
some reason or another. No funny stuff, ole' lady, 
'cause I'm right behind you."
On the ridiculous pretense that a firechief 
would soon be there to give the Reference Room 
a safety check, the three students cleared out. 
Tom played it low-key for a moment, hoping the 
fellows would go upstairs. One of them did, two 
stayed downstairs. "Good enough," Tom thought. 
"The less I have to handle, the better. Finally, 
when the two sat reading magazines, and no one 
except the one librarian knew what was going on 
(and even she didn't have such a hot idea yet) 
Tom made his main move.

---------------------------------------------------

November 22, 1977-TAR TAN-page 13
He ripped the newspaper off the bamboo rod, 
and waving it and his paperback in the air he 
screamed "allright everybody, listen up. This is 
what you would call your basic library-whacking." 
Tom's voice shook with emotion while he 
shouted directions. "Now everybody, and I mean 
everybody do exactly as I tell you and nobody's 
going to get hurt. If anyone make the slightest 
hint of a false move, then one of my two friends 
here," he paused and nodded at the "weapons" 
in each of his hands, "is gonna stop you... dead!" 
Maybe it was the deadly tone in his voice, or 
maybe that set look in his eyes, but whatever it 
was, there were 17 people on the first floor of 
Hunt Library who couldn't have believed Tom 
more if he would have had a bazooka in his hand.
"O.K., you's behind the desk, otta there and 
...HEY YOU, DONT TOUCH THAT 
PHONE!!!" Tom exclaimed. "Security'll find out 
about this soon enough. O.K. now you newspaper 
reader, get over with the desk people and every
body move into the corner of the Reserve Room, 
except you four guys. Any of you make just one 
suspicious move," Tom emphasized again, and my 
Thompson 44 here (Tom wiggled his bamboo rod) 
gets it's first test."
While Tom had the four men barricading the 
stairway with tables and trophy cases, Tom hinself found some keys and locked up the main en
trance doors. Finally, when everything was set to 
his satisfaction, everybody huddled in the back 
corner next to the windows on the first floor of 
Hunt Library.
As the minutes ground into half hours, a crowd 
began forming outside the window in the corner. 
A few people tried to get in and found the doors 
locked. Inside, Tom allowed murmurings between 
people, but he cut short any extended conversa
tions.
"Why are we listening to this jerk?" one guy 
whispered to another. "Christ, all he's got is some 
stupid stick and a goddamn paperback. Let's 
jump him!!"
"Are you crazy?" his listener replied. "Just 
look at the guy's face, his eyes. Guns or no guns, 
God only knows what the h=ll he'd do if we 
rushed him."
"But there's 17 of us!" the first fellow ex
claimed silently. "Shit, it's worth a try."
"No way, man. Don't forget 7 of "us" are 
chicks, and 2 of those old ladies. That leaves 10. 
And I don't care if I got 10 or 100 guys behind 
me, I don't go around rushin' fruitcakes."
"Gutless," the first gent muttered.
"No, Smart," the second snapped back quietly. 
"Let's just wait for security to handle this."
"Oh, I didn't know you had 'till next week," 
the first student replied.
"Hey, keep it quiet, you guys in the back," 
Tom snarled.
"Hey listen man," the second student shouted, 
"why you doin' this to us? What are you tryin' to 
prove anyway?"
Tom didn't answer right away, but thought 
some. "What am I trying to prove?" he asked 
himself, trying to find reality again. But his anger 
and frustration drowned out his sensibility and 
he confidently replied "none of your business, pal, 
so just shuttup!'' But the second young man 
would not shut up.
"Well, if you're not going to iell me why you're 
holding us, will you at least call security ana tell 
them your demands so we can get outta here?"
"Demands?" Tom echoed.
"Yeah, you know," one of the young ladies

chipped in, "what you want in exchange for us."
There was a moment's silence. "I don't feel 
like giving my demands just right now," Tom said 
said.
"O.K. big man," the second student said, 
playing Tom's game, "you think you're so great 
just because you've got a couple guns in your 
hand. Well, let's see how great you are with your 
mouth. Call security now and give 'em your 
demands. Or do you still want to hide behind 
your weapons?"
At first they thought Tom was going to bull his 
way through them and kill the guy. That's how 
angry he looked. But then a sort of sarcastic grin 
fell on his face as he said; "O.K. hot shit, I'll give 
'em my demands now, just like you say. Either 
way it ain't no big deal to me." As Tom backed 
away from them to the phone at the staff's work 
desk, the group never left his sight. It was during 
this time that the man who had been getting to

You sons and daughters of the Depression

Feet shuffling below question mark 
spines, men shuffle almost in procession 
to shuffleboard courts. Ancient china dolls 
applying make-up with arthritic hands, 
your ruby-smudged cheeks attempt elegance 
for some reason, but why, no one recalls.
I see all this but do nothing. What can

Of such stuff as clouds are made.

Fiery eyes of emerald green

Flying like leaves before the storm.
Still do I grieve.

The sleek and silver birds stand now at heavy rest, 
Their brilliant plummage glistening in the sun.
Shrill sounds as motors whirr around them, 
Testing of their mettle, has, at last, begun.
Soon they'll soar into the blue above them, 
Parting clouds and rain, set on a distant course.
But now, they lumber and move slowly,
Sucking fluid from the earth, which is their 
source.
Oh birds, you have no parallel in nature,
For strength and speed and miracles performed.
Why did I cringe and shudder in your belly,
When whipped and tossed through weather when 
it stormed, v
I know the power of your steel and motored 
body, And fear of you is said to be absurd.
But man created you its mammoth monster,
While God created feathers and a bird.

A lonely autumn leaf quivers on a bare branch 
of a tree, outside the library window, 
tormented by the wind.
Its greeness has turned to brown. 
Now dry and brittle, it clings for life 
tormented by the wind.
Last spring, it was quite tiny then it grew, to 
spend all its life and strength clinging, 
tormented only by the wind.
Finally, it grows tired of holding on. It falls 
to the ground and is covered by others which 
were tormented by the wind.
But beneath the snow, it will become part of the 
earth and mingle with its mother's roots, and 
next spring it will reappear, only to be 
tormented by the wind.
Airports can be lonely places, 
Phantom figures, hazy faces.
Peering out from glassy walls, 
Shadows in huge hallway sprawls.
People coming, people going,
Faces strained, exhaustion showing.
From distant journeys now returning, 
For some rest, their bodies yearning.
Till a familiar face appears,
Happy heartbeat, lessened fears.
Here at last some loving eyes,
Dearer than the friendly skies.
Soothing whispers, tender hands,
No more alone, in foreign lands.

Growing up, my Dad was a saint to me.
When asked the definition of 'father,'
I just said, "Fathers should be like my Dad." 
Don't ask for the details. He provided, 
loved, taught, offered wisdom. He did it all. 
He was easy going and lovable.
The man was made of goodness and virtue. 
But what didn't exactly click in my head, 
about my father, was that he killed flies. 
Destroyed flies. Beat them with his palms.
Mashed them 
with a fist of rage and anger. Then he'd 
wash his hands, kiss me, and tuck me in bed.

An hour and a half after Tom's initial move, 
security pulled up in front of Hunt Library. This 
was just as Tom was beginning to dial for them. 
As he glanced for a second at the security van, the 
second siudent made his move. With an ener
getic "NOW!" he leaped 15 feet to his left, 
snatched a book from the shelf, and kneeled 
behind a pillar. Tom, in shock for a moment, 
froze with the receiver in his hand. Student 
number two used this opportunity to the fullest 
as he moved his head to the left and, catch
ing sight of Tom, thrust out his book, holding 
it in his right hand. Recovering, Tom reached 
for his newspaper rod next to the phone. But 
before he could even touch it, the second student 
screamed: 'Touch that piece and I'll drop you,"
,m1 wouldn't dare, " Tom said, hiding his 
uncertainty.
'Try me," the second student replied flatly.
As security and 60 odd students looked 
through the window, they witnessed Tom drop 
the phone out of his hand, and put his arms up 
over his head. Then they saw the second stu
dent come 1r to Tom slowly, pointing a book at 
him. They watched in amazement as the hero 
grabbed the newspaper holder and paperback 
that were next to Tom, and throw them far away

"Hey Bill, ya got a second?"
"Sure, what's up?"
"Got to change a light bulb, and it's somewhat 
tricky."
"You've got to be kidding, a double E, having 
trouble changing a light bulb?"
For some reason, I had a feeling this wasn't my 
day. First of all my minicomputer, a computer 
that I designed and built with my own hands was 
cheating at Tic-Tac-Toe. And I was late for my 
job interview. What else could go wrong? As I 
walked out of my room in what seemed like a 
dark and gloomy hallway, I soon realized what 
Jim had meant by 'tricky'.
"What happened?"
"Well, I forgot which way the thing turns..."
"You turned it the wrong way and broke it off, 
great."
Now I knew this wasn't my day.
"OK Jim, let's see what you have."
As I surveyed the situation it seemed as if Jim had 
screwed the light bulb the wrong way, breaking 
off the glass bulb so that only a metal stub re
mained. I guess that mammoth hand of his didn't 
realize its own strength.
"Let me get my needle nose, and you make 
sure the switch is off down the hall".
"You're supposed to turn off the power?"
In a short moment I had returned with my needle 
nose pliers in hand and a tool kit, 'just in case'.
"Are you sure the switch is off?"
"Yes, I'm sure, I checked it with my Volt
meter."
"OK,. hmmm...this is sure wedged in alright... 
if I apply a torque normal to the stud... this 
mother is stuck... I hear footsteps down there. I 
thought we were the only two here. Hey don't 
turn on the*...'ZAP'.....light."
"Bill, Bill, are you OK?"
"Couple bad cuts and burns, fortunately my 
resistance is only 105.678 k-ohms, never mind me 
look what happended to my needle nose... that 
guy ruined my $7.95 needle nose pliers. Now go 
and kill the breaker before I get killed."
Jim left to turn off the circuit breakers only to 
return minutes later with a large and somewhat 
heavy electronic device.
"What's that for?"
"Well, Bill, you know how when you tap the 
lid on an over tight ketchup lid it makes it easy to 
twist off."
"Yeah, what does that have to do with it?"
"Well, if I apply a small amount of ultrasonics 
to the thing it would be the same if not better 
than tapping it and therefore it will come off 
easier."
"OK, what have we got to lose?"
Precisely setting the controls, he took careful 
aim with his device, and pointed it toward the 
light socket. A loud hum emanated from his de
vice, which got louder and louder.
"Jim, isn't that a little too much, Jim, I think 
you're using too much power...."
Before I could say another word, Jim's device had 
shaken loose the bulb stub as well as the light
fixture from the wall.
"Oh boy! Do you think I may have overdone 
it?"
"Not if you wanted to knock down the fixture 
in the first place... Oh speaking of exams I got to 
get going."
"Wait a minute, what exams? This is Saturday 
... Jim... Jim what am I going to do? Jim..."

G B SHAW: YOU
A Theatre Review 
Play: You Never Can Tell 
Author: George Bernard Shaw 
Company: Pittsburgh Public Theatre
by Casey Childs
NEVER CAN TELL
HANDEL AT HEINZ
George Frederick Handel remains very 
much alive in Pittsburgh as his beloved or
atorio Messiah is performed in Heinz Hall 
each December before sold-out houses.
It is scheduled this year on Sunday, Mon
day, and Tuesday evenings at 8 PM. Dec
ember 4, 5, and 6. His Messiah lives on 
though its composer died in 1759.
Some will ask if You Never Can Tell 
merits a revival at all. Why should it? The 
characters are frivolous, the issues addres
sed are thin and it doesnt seem to be in 
the least way representative of Shavian 
drama.
But these are exactly the reasons to 
' revive it.
Plays like Don Juan in Hell and Major Barbara have conditioned the modern aud
ience into expecting, at best, social satire, 
and at worst, haughty preaching from 
George Bernard Shaw. Redigestations of 
these classic workhorses will be making 
their way back to the boards for years to 
come, How refreshing it is to witness the 
regeneration of one of his lesser known 
works. Who can predict when were likely 
to see this delicate bubble of harmless 
humor again.
The Pittsburgh Public Theatre opened 
Shaws You Never Can Tell on November 9 
and will be running it thru December 11.1 
went wanting a good time from this eveing of theatre - and thats exactly what I 
o got. Its tone is light and its pretensions are 
mild, but it is a good play with some of the 
authors most important ideas flying 
around within it.You Never Can Tell is a genuine freak in 
the Shaw library. The script itself is as 
innocent as its title. Shaw had higher inten
sions than this form allowed for, so he later 
abandoned this whimsical style and fanci
ful subject matter altogether.
Shaw created this play in hopes of 
attracting the commercial theatre audience 
of his day whod grown weary of his end
less social sermonizing. In 1895, the year 
that it was written, Shaw was making ene
mies fast in his endeavors to improve the 
English audiences tastes and performers 
standards. His plays were his pulpit.
In the plays preface, Shaw admits that 
he might be selling himself a bit short by 
employing all of the cheap theatrical con
ventions that the Lofidon audiences had 
grown to expect: (fashionable dresses, 
pretty scenes, a little music, comic wai
ters, etc.). Yet, in his own words, he was 
more interested in showing that drama 
can humanize these things as easily as they, 
in undramatic hands, can dehumanize the 
drama.
To this extent, he succeeded; although 
fie felt that in his effort to make his play icceptable, he made it impractical as well. 
Shaw tried desparately to direct the preniere production of the play - and failed.
In short, You Never Can Tell comes to 
the Public with a rather controversial back
ground, which is amusing considering the 
easygoing harmlessness of the play itself. 
The Public, under the skilled eye of their 
guest director John Going, make great 
sense out of this nonsensical entity. They 
manage to offer a delightful evening of 
entertainment.
True, the script never reaches any great 
height of style, it limps a bit. But Going 
and his company never make the mistake 
of taking any of it too seriously. The cast 
seem to be having an actors holiday in 
roles that know few boundaries. It isnt 
hard to detect that Shaw doesnt fully have 
his heart in this work, and its reassuring to 
see that Going does. This isnt Shaw at his 
best. But the plays virtues counteract its 
shortcomings, and this was the given from 
which Going and his company proceeded.
The plot line is playfully complex in its 
simplicity. Any attempt to outline it in full 
would be ludicrous. The majority of the 
action takes place on a seaside resort hotel 
where a Mrs. Clandon and her three child
ren are in temporary residence. Mr. Valen
tine is a dentist, (a gum architect), whos 
new to his practice. His first patient is 
Dolly Clandon, daughter of Mrs. Clandon 
and sister of Gloria Clandon. Gloria is 
Shaws twentieth-century girl whom 
Valentine falls in love with at first sight.
Valentines landlord is one Fergus 
Crampton who turns out to be the very 
long lost husband of Mrs. Clandon and her 
three children. Mrs. Clandon has reworked 
the family name preferring the sound of 
Clandon to that of Crampton. Shaw is 
playing name games with us.
Mrs. Clandon succumbs to her question
ing children and reveals that she left her 
husband eighteen years ago because of 
his cruelty to her. They all find themselves 
at the same table for lunch: Valentine, 
Crampton, Clandon and her children inclu
ded. The atmosphere is electrifying. But 
William the waiter saves the situation and 
keeps peace in the family with his tact.
From here the plot doesnt have very 
many places it can go. But it doesnt 
matter. By now the plot is of minimal im
portance. In conclusion, however,Valentine 
is to marry Gloria, Crampton softens up to 
his wife and children, and William the 
waiter continues to prove himself the mas
ter of such situations.
The play has an inherent vitality of its 
own and Going capitalizes on this. The 
staging is so wonderfully fashioned and so 
cleverly orchestrated that where the writer 
lags, the director leaps. Shaw had a tend
ency of continuing to write long after the 
point of a scene had been established. Here 
the direction breaks the writers occasional 
monotony.
Every character in You Never Can Tell 
is a comic relief. The prime role is that of 
William the waiter. 1. M. Hobson handles 
this pluperfect servant with comic expert
ise, underplaying him just enough so as not 
to lose the subtleties of texture Shaw made 
explicit in the character. John Seidman and 
Gun-Marie Nilsson, as the twin children of 
Mrs. Clandon are also humorously effecttive. Going has synchronized their mirrored 
movements to such a point that they seem 
to move as one person when they occupy 
the stage together. They orbit around the
rest of the characters.
Avril Gentles is marvelous as the ful
crum of the family, Mrs. Clandon; and Ro
bert Blackburn as the belligerent Crampton 
compliments her domineering nature per
fectly. Richard Dix as McComas, a friend 
of the familys, is properly pompous as he
strives to keep the unexpected family re
union from becoming a free-for-all.
Ivar Brogger and Erika Peterson are del
egated the two most difficult parts in the 
play, those of Valentine and Gloria, the 
lovers. It is chiefly in their scenes that 
Shaw chose to propagate his hard-nosed 
philosophies on marriage and reason and 
any other useful lessons he could slip in. 
They look like the forerunners of the Jack 
Tanner and Ann Whitefield characters in 
Shaws later play Man and Superman. Such 
didactic love scenes could be lethal in the 
wrong hands. Here they are smooth, quick 
and deftly handled. They capture the mys
tery in the illusions and disillusions of love 
rather than focus on the dogma Shaw is 
peddling.
The Public Theatres facility doesnt 
allow them the luxury of mounting any 
play on a grand scale. The stage is buttres
sed around by audience on all four sides. 
David Tosers costumes and Virginia 
Dancys and Elmon Webbs scenery supply 
all of the lavish embellishment the play 
demands. The surroundings are stuffed to 
their Victorian gills.
With all of its seeming frailties, You Never Can Tell reaffirms our faith in Shaw 
as a comic genius. His true comic intelli
gence permeated everything he ever wrote. 
His characters are rich, provocative, intelli
gent and very human. They also talk a lot. 
No other English speaking playwright of 
our century has had this kind of command 
with the language which shines through You Never Can Tell even in its most stag
nant sections.

SCOTCH 'N' SODA ORIGINALS
A Theatre Review 
Event: Three one-acts 
Company: Scotch 'N' Soda
by Joan Livitski
With the pressures of school work and 
all the complaining about no one having 
any time, its reassuring to find a group of 
students, Scotch N Soda, who are willing 
to make the time to spread some fun and 
entertainment. Granted, there were flaws, 
but a commendable effort was made for 
the amount of preparation time.
Of the three one-acts produced, the 
best was the very first, Right Time, Wrong Place. Basically the concept of a hood 
that doesnt want to kill but is afraid of 
appearing a coward is good. A valiant 
attempt at depicting a psychotic mind in 
the character of Louie was made, and yet 
there was a problem of fluidity. We go 
back and forth from reality to flashes 
of Louies imagination. The flow is good 
going into the hallucination, but awkward 
coming out. There tends to be gaps partly 
due to the necessary blackout to get 
other people off stage.
The light touches of comic relief are 
sparse enough not to detract from the 
serious theme of the play, and yet are 
substantial enough to keep the play from 
getting too heavy. The best relief is in the 
first fantasy where Louie tries to rob a 
rich couple. The husband, Cunnius, not 
only has gems of lines to work with but his 
presentation is excellent too.
The ending has too much build-up 
of Louie shooting himself. In each of the 
other killings its spontaneous. Its as 
though he doesnt think about what hes 
doing; he just reacts. His suicide, much to 
the contrary, gives too much premedita
tion. We know its coming. Theres not that 
element of surprise experienced before. 
Louie says hes going to kill himself, re
tells us, then tells us again by calling 
explicit attention to his actions. He does 
everything but draw us a diagram.
The noise heard by Louie that sends 
him into a panic that someone is after him, 
is left as a loose end. Its this element that 
seems intended to carry the message, and 
yet its lost. When the pawnbroker that 
Louie was to kill comes on stage to find his 
cat, it allows for the perfect symbolic 
clincher. We w.iit, and wait, but all that 
happens is that he walks off with cat in 
hands. Whether the playwright meant it 
or not, it would be poignant to make it 
evident that the noise was made by the cat, 
that scared the killer, that saved the 
pawn-broker, (that lived in the house 
that Jack built).
The second of the three, though i: 
has some interesting elements, is the 
weakest. Its piecemeal fashion lacks a 
point. The suggestion one gets from the 
title, Jaqueline Suzanne Died over the Weekend, is misleading.
We see tour female characters get to
gether to play cards. The action is too 
contrived in that its unbelievable. All of 
the women are too alike, making it boring. 
They all come across as upper middle 
class wives who dont need to work, have 
too much time on their hands, and havent 
an ounce of brains in their heads. The fact 
that its written by a male is obvious.
There are a few good ideas floating 
around in the uncontrolled whole of the 
script. The playwright came up with 
convincing dialogue at least for the phone 
conversations, likewise there are topics 
within the whole that could each be 
developed to produce plays far better 
than the one presented.

THE FUNNIEST SHOW IN TOWN____________

Written, Composed and Directed by William Turner
TH MbRQUK D Sit
JU9TM
Adapted by Leon Katz 
Directed by Jed Harris
A comparison is made between the 
treatment of Kates dogs as children and 
one of the other womens treatment of 
her children like pets. Another developable 
theme is where 'one woman speaks of her 
marriage as existing only for sex, while 
Elizabeth states her marriage is full in 
every regard but sex. There is just too 
much material for a one-act play.
My biggest objection is the handling 
or mishandling of factual information. 
The first phone conversation mentions the 
death of the friends mother and the 
to have to go through the belongings 
with the body not cold yet is awful. 
But how can the body not be cold if she 
died a week ago? An even bigger flaw is in 
deciphering how the title and play are 
related. Ms. Suzannes book Valley Of the Dolls is being read by Elizabeth and the 
women mention the authors death, but 
this is not enough to derive a title from.
The last play, Stormy Night, shows 
promise. What it needs is the addition of 
a middle. The beginning is developed 
scriptwise.
This play shows a need for justification. 
The story revolves around a boyfriend and 
girlfriend who are having both sets of 
parents over to his apartment. Theres 
the expected uneasiness, yet when the 
two fathers begin to talk about golf and 
get friendly they are cut short because 
theyre going to bore everyone. Who 
gets bored over a discourse of three lines?
Theres a short black-out scene during 
which the dinner has taken place. What 
we see after is over the coffee kind of chit
chat. The problem here is that an impor
tant element is lost. The boys mother 
comes across as the overly protective 
mother. She gives the impression that no 
girl is good enough for her little boy and
that nothing short of a miracle will change 
her mind. Yet after the meal we see a com
pletely different Mrs. Bumahm as far as 
personality goes. We need to see the 
interaction at the dinner table to see 
a gradual softening, else we are lead to 
think that she had a bit too much wine, 
with supper.
The ending needs polish. Theres too 
much material jammed into too short 
a time. The playwright appears to have 
realized that he had a lot of loose ends to 
tie up awfully quick if it was to stay a 
one-act, which I think it would do better 
in a longer version. The result we see is 
an unbelievable ending. It just happens 
to be raining, which just happens to 
trigger Mrs. Bumahm into telling a sen
timental, dull story, which happens to be 
the one she told her husband the night he 
decided to propose, which just happens 
to lead into the young couples plans to 
announce their engagement, the lights 
just happen to go out for a flash, the guy 
just happens to have the ring to whip 
out, his father just happens to walk in with 
a tray of champagne and glasses, and 
everyone just happens to love the whole 
idea, life just isnt that smooth.
Theres no one ready for Broadway, 
but the feeling I got was that a good 
time was had by cast and audience alike. 
And isnt that what its all about?

BOBBY DEERFIELD LACKS SUSPENSE
A Movie Review 
Film: Bobby Deerfield 
Director: Sidney Pollack 
Stars: Al Pacino and
Marthe Keller
by John Morris
Bobby Deerfield, starring Marthe Keller 
and Al Pacino, directed by Sidney Pollack, 
and adapted from Erich Maria Remarques 
novel Heaven Has No Favorites, seems as jf 
it should be an important film. Keller has 
appeared stunningly in European films, 
most notably in Claude Lelonches And Now My Love, and made her American de
but in Marathon Man. Al Pacino and Sid
ney Pollack have already established for
midable reputations.
Yet, Bobby Deerfield succeeds at not
hing more than blandness. It is inoffensive, 
sometimes very pleasant, but more often 
>; than not it is banal and ultimately tiresome.
Its opening fmds autoracer Bobby Deer
field (Al Pacino) trying to fathom the 
death of another racer. Bobby takes racing 
quite seriously. This is communicated by a 
perplexed expression on his face whenever
"a vacuous script and 
senseless miscasting are 
the film's major draw
backs."
he is near an automobile or racetrack. The 
competitive and psychological aspects 
which could have put this film in league 
with Downhill Racer are never explored. 
The fact that Bobby is a racer seems inci
dental, it serves merely as the important 
profession of the lead character in an 
important film.
Things go trudgingiy until Marthe Keller 
appears. Bobby meets her at the Sanitarium 
where he visits another racer injured in the crash. We learn early on that she is dying,
and this knowledge robs the film of what 
little suspense it might have had. Bobby is 
also preoccupied with death, but his awe
some pondering is on the adolescent level, 
while Keller seems to have chosen a nobly
martyred attitude. She is the strong silent 
type, while Bobby avoids facing the issue. 
Even when he finds clumps of her hair on 
the pillow, Bobby doesnt catch on. He 
seems rather to be wondering what sham
poo he should recommend.
Of course, a vacuous script and senseless 
miscasting are the films major drawbacks. 
Marthe Keller, the ideal of teutonic health, 
looks like the type of person who would 
live well past eighty. Thus, the audience, 
like Bobby, cant really take her impending 
death seriously. And Bobby, who should 
have all the trappings of Machismo, is play
ed by Pacino with introspection and moroseness. The situation would be better 
if the roles were reversed.
Kellers hearty ebullience hardly seems 
appropriate as the means of melting Bobbys 
wall of alienation to teach him the real 
meaning of death. Likewise, their affair 
seems rather improbable, a ritual only 
observed because these two movie stars are 
in the same film together.
When the script lags, the actors launch 
into rather meaningless imagery about the 
moon, wind and stars. This kills time, but 
doesnt really contribute to character 
depth. More importantly, the films death 
wish is unfulfilled. The film flirts with the 
idea of death throughout, but never cap
tures its essence. Perhaps this is a result 
from the audience expecting Kellers death 
for so long - when it finally happens it 
doesnt seem quite real. I believe the con
cept of a beautiful young woman in love 
dying of an incurable disease has
treated before, but this time there is a 
twist. Nobody is surprised and nobody is 
touched.
Marthe Keller and Al Pacino try hard to 
transcend the anemic script, sometimes 
succeeding, but in the long run they are 
defeated. The film is beautiful visually, but 
this is not due to inventive cinematography.
Due to the interruption caused by 
Thanksgiving break, there will be no show 
in the Gallery this week. However, opening 
next Tuesday, is the Second Annual Freshman-Sophomore show. Before last year, 
underclassmen had no opportunity for 
this type of professional exhibition. The 
Freshman-Sophomore show was designed tc 
meet this need.
Today an artist must exhibit in public 
if he expects to establish a reputation and 
presumably earn a living by his art. And, 
like it or not, because along with the glory 
is the headache, one has to get used to 
having shows. This was the rationale of 
the Gallerys inception, to maintain a pub
lic exhibition area where students could 
become familiar with gallery operations.
But the Forbes Street Gallery has only 
so much time and so much space, and it 
has been the custom to give priority to 
senior Art students. This does not exclude 
the possibility of other groups being given 
show dates, and this years successful 
Theater show gives testimony to the bene
fits of flexibility. The Freshman-Sophomore show is another example of the 
Gallerys interest in extending its services 
as much as possible to the entire student 
body.
The hreshman-Sophmore show is not 
limited to Art students alone; freshmen 
and sophmores from any department can 
have their work exhibited. So while Art 
majors are given a preview of what is to
Anything filmed in the Swiss Alps and 
Florence, Italy would have to be mucked 
up pretty badly not to be visually exciting.
Nonetheless, if stretching your mind is 
not a consideration, and youd like to see 
some attractive people motoring through 
some of Europes loveliest scenery, see Bobby Deerfield.
come, non-Art majors are given a chance 
they might not otherwise have to see their 
private drawings hanging in public exhi
bit. Of course, one might choose not to 
see his work on display, and this public/ 
private dichotomy is a hard issue to 
resolve. Certainly one can be an artist 
without ever exhibiting, just as one can 
create art without being an Art major. 
And while exhibiting oneself is a necessity 
for those who plan to make their living at 
it, it is more of a titillating option for those 
who practice their art in the secrecy of 
their room.
ITie Freshman-Sophomore show then, 
and all art to some extent, represents 
a display of the artists private imaginations 
and ambitions. When looking at the work 
it is worthwhile to keep in mind that none 
of the exhibitors had to do this work. 
This is clear for the non-Art majors, but 
it is just as true for those studying painting 
or sculpture; nobody threatened to break 
their thumbs if they didnt pick up the 
paintbrush. People like creating art, and 
those of us who dont create it, through 
laziness or self-consiousness, should give 
ourselves the opportunity to appreciate 
the work of those who do, by attending 
shows.
Remember: the Freshman -Sophomore 
show opens the Tuesday after vacation, 
with the traditional celebration Tuesday 
night, open to one and all, and continues 
through to the following Sunday.

for USW Local 1397 in Homestead, it was 
moved to the Music Hall in order to acc

The choice of the Homestead Carnegie

three generations of Mon Valley steel

selves and their families. Though much 
of the story is set in Braddock, some of 
the scenes take place in Homestead around

Peer Help, the counseling center run and 
staffed by CMU students, is facing both an 
image problem as well as a shortage of 
counselors, according to Co-Director 
Donna Wright.
According to Wright, many students at 
CMU do not know all the functions of Peer 
Help. Students know little more [about 
Peer Help] than the tutoring service and 
the Housing Board. The free tutoring ser
vice is available to all students having dif
ficulty in their courses. The Housing 
Board provides information on off-campus 
housing.
Peer Help also functions as a peer coun
seling center, a referral center, and a health 
service center which supplies health services 
counseling and emergency funding.
Wright also explained that many stu
dents have a false image of the counseling 
service. She explained that generally peo
ple think that Peer Help cant help them 
with their problems because counselors 
just listen. But Peer Help counselors go 
through a seven to eight week training pro
gram where they are taught to be active 
listeners, with the philosophy that given 
the proper guidance, each client can arrive 
at his own solution.
Peer Help is waiting for a training 
period to end sofnew counsellors can be 
recruited to help the present six. Wright 
explained that most of last years counsel
ors have either graduated or left school.
She and co-director Phil Burda expect to 
have about twenty-five counselors at the 
end of the training.
In the training program, trainees learn 
1) self-awareness (with emphasis on aware
ness exercises), 2) the philosophy and 
principles of Rogerian counseling (trained 
listening), and 3) office procedures (how to 
be a counselor in the Peer Help office). 
Some of the concepts taught include em
pathy, non-judgmental attitudes toward 
me client, and an approach that steers 
clear of advice-giving.
Wright commented that the training 
program is not just for counselors. It is 
open to all students, and some of the con
cepts learned in the program can be used in 
everyday life.
Sue Meyer, a Peer Help counselor and 
co-director of the tutoring service, stated 
that sometimes active listeners can help 
a person better than friends can. She ex
plained that counselors are trained in de
tecting verbal and non-verbal cues which 
they can interpret and relate back to the 
student. Often when students discuss 
problems with friends, the friend would 
say, Well if you think you have problems 
. . . etc. Trained listeners would not com
pare themselves or anyone else to a coun
seled student, Meyer added.
Meyer continued to say that the coun
selors prefer to do in-person counseling, at 
the Baker Hall 150 office, although tele
phone counseling is available. All counsel
ing sessions are confidential.

Moonlighting, Earl?
by Mike Pochan
Imagine one man in a striped shirt de
ciding who will be the recipient of the 
countrys highest collegiate football honor, 
the national championship, the number 
one designation that carries with it fame, 
prestige, and a lot of TV money. One man, 
who with the blow of a whistle or the 
casual casting of a flag, can change the des
tinies of yoying men and the blood pressure 
of screaming, maniacal fans. Does a man of 
such omnipotence truly exist, and does he 
have time to spare a few words for the 
lowly persons who watch these football 
games on television?
Of course I have a few minutes, 
answers Earl J. Birdy, director of intramur
al athletics at CMU and a professional col
lege football official, But what is this 
youre telling me? That I have the power to 
decide the national champion?
No way. The teams out on the field 
decide who is best. They make the big 
plays and the big mistakes. Its my job to 
point out their mistakes to them. I dont 
care who wins or if they are number one or 
number 99 in the nation. I give them my 
best effort. Thats what Im paid for.
All joking aside, Birdy has worked as 
head linesman and line judge in some 
pretty impressive games. Aside from num
erous Pitt, Penn State, and Maryland games 
over the last 16 years, E. J. officiated the
1975 Orange Bowl with Penn State versus
Earl J. Birdy
LSU. He has also had run-ins with some 
Heismann Trophy winners.
Earl Birdy almost ejected Ed Marinaro 
from a game for throwing a ball at an op
ponent, but last year in the Pitt-WVU 
contest, he threw Tony Dorsett out of the 
game for throwing a punch (but there were 
only 26 seconds left, so you probably 
didnt notice).
Look for E. J. on November 26 as he 
works as line judge for the Pitt-Penn State 
showdown. Hell be the one that Jackie 
Sherrill will be cursing on offsides calls.

Hordatt Three Time PAC All-Star
There is a growing dynasty residing in 
the West Virginia sector of the Presidents 
Athletic Conference.
Bethanys Bisons captured their second 
straight loop soccer crown by virtue of a 
2-1 victory over Case Western Reserve and 
0-0 stalemate with Allegheny. That pair 
of contests left the Bisons of Coach John 
Cunningham with a 5-0-1 league slate.
In addition to its second consecutive 
title, BC has now garnered the loops 
championship toga seven out of the last 
ten seasons. The Bisons were led by the 
scoring-happy trio of John Sholhead (sev
en), Jack Mackouse (five), and Dan Dunflieyer (four).
Case Western Reserve and Coach Jerry 
Harbak had to settle for bridesmaid honors 
in 77. That tough loss to Bethany was the 
Spartans only league setback but the clubs 
fine 5-1 PAC mark was only good enough 
for the runner-up spot. Aziz Boukhechba 
emerged as Cases leading goal scorer, as 
well as the league runner-up, with nine 
allies.
Alleghenys Gators proved to be the 
only squad that could blemish Bethanys 
near-perfect campaign, as the booters of 
Coach Tom Erdos earned a hard-fought
0-0 season-ending draw with BC. The 
Gators, ending their PAC season with a 
4-1-1 ledger, rode the heels of forward 
Dave Nelson, who tallied a league-leading
0iine goals.
Camegie-Mellon closed at the .500 mark 
as the Tartans showed a 3-3 loop log. Tom 
Binnie, a junior defender, led CMU with a 
trio of goals, including the lone score in a
1-0 victory over Hiram. 
????????????
The votes are in and the 1977 PAC Alljg^eague soccer selections have been made,
headed by the naming of Bethanys Jack 
Mackouse as the loops Most Valuable 
Player for the second straight season, a 
league first.
Mackhouse, who led Bethany to its 
second consecutive league title (seventh in 
the past decade) had a strong supporting 
cast, as no less than a quarter of his team
mates joined him in garnering all-star 
status.
Junior goalie Mike Zebrini was accorded 
laurels for the second time and sophomore 
defender Baba Salia, senior mid-fielder 
Larry Altmann and sophomore forward 
John Sholhead received the award for the 
initial time.
Loop runner-up Case Western Reserve 
was a close second again, this time in all
league selections, as the Spartans had the 
foursome of senior mid-fielder Oscar 
Rodas and sophomore forward Aziz Bouk
hechba (both for the second time) and 
junior defender Steve Simmons and Wolf
gang Urban, a frosh mid-fielder, both firsttimers.
Camegie-Mellon, Hiram and Allegheny 
all had a pair on the star-studded list. 
Besides Hordatt, Tom Binnie, a junior 
defender, was the other CMU selection. 
In addition to Nelson, junior mid-fielder 
Rich Scott was the other Allegheny contri
bution. Dave Barman, a senior forward, 
and Dave Burkey, a sophomore goalie, 
second and first-timers respectively, repre
sented Hiram.
Marco Iglesias, a sophomore defender 
from John Carroll and a first-time award 
recipient, rounded out the loops top-flight 
list that included only four seniors, while 
boasting six juniors, a quintet of sophs, and 
a lone yearling.
John Carroll (2-4), Hiram (15), and
Washington & Jefferson (06) rounded 
out the leagues seven positions.
Though PAC members proved to be 
tough on each other, non-league opponents 
found the loop somewhat more difficult
to handle. Against non-league schools, 
the septet of PAC member institutions had 
a combined 16-win, 14-loss, 3-tie mark, as 
well as outscoring its foes by a 7862 
margin.

CMU DOMINATES PAC GRIDIRON VOTING
Kennedy Named League Offensive Player
The Camegie-Mellon Tartans, this years 
PAC champions, dominated the recent 
polling for the All-Conference Football 
Squad. CMU filled no less than one third of 
the positions available with eight Tartans, 
three on offense and five on defense, 
making the first squad. Also, coach Chuck 
Klausing, who guided the Tartans to an 
8 1 overair record (70 in the Presidents 
Conference) was unanimously selected as 
the Coach of the Year.
On offense, quarterback Bob Kennedy 
was selected as the Offensive Player of the 
Year edging out Allegheny tailback Mark
Matlack. Kennedy, ran the option beauti
fully this year for the Tartans, gaining 
520 yards on just 76 carries while passing 
for 317 yards on 18 completions for 36 
attempts. Gary Bonn, a senior fullback 
from Massachusetts, was also selected to 
the first team offensive backfield while 
taking the league scoring crown on 12 
touchdowns for 72 points. John Bielich, 
a senior offensive lineman from Pittsburgh, 
was the other Tartan selected to the offen
sive squad and along with Jay Meenan 
(2nd Team) and Mark Uram (Honorable 
^ Mention) are the only Tartans with no 
stats to prove their worth. Needless to say 
they must have been doing something right 
for an offense that amassed 2779 rushing 
yards, a new league record.
On defense the Tartans were led by co
captain Rick Lackner who was the teams 
leading tackier from his middle linebacker 
position while missing two games due 
to a severe lower back injury. Rounding 
out the defensive selectees were linesmen 
Bob Hantz and Mike Jochman, both 
seniors and the 5th and 6th leading tacklers 
respectively. Defensive end Mark Demo 
and back Gus Sunseri were the youngest 
Tartans to make the team and as soph
omores have two years left to haunt op
posing offenses for the Tartans.
Also selected to the second team were 
running back Rick Leaman, the Tartans 
x leading rusher with 565 yards in 124 at
tempts; Tony Digoia at tight end who was 
the Tartans 2nd leading receiver with 10 
catches for 192 yards; Jay Meenan, offen
sive linesman and a senior from Mount 
Lebanon who helped the Tartans achieve 
such feats as gaining 611 total yards 
offense against Oberlin ^nd setting a new 
league record for total offense.
