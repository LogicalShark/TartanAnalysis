Negotiations 
result in 
Wonder Boys 
viewing
by Aseem Gupta
Webmaster
Over six thousand students expe
rienced the disruption of classes last 
spring for the filming of Wonder 
Boys, and about one sixth of them 
will be able to view the film for free 
when it comes to CMU for a twoshow screening tentatively slated for 
February 29. After negotiating with 
Paramount Pictures and their local 
representative, National
Amusements, administrators are 
close to securing a date when the 
film will show in McConomy audito
rium for the CMU community.
We have a tentative agreement 
right now, said Don Hale, vice pres
ident of University Relations. We 
have talked to the distribution com
pany and were trying to nail down a 
date. It will premiere in Pittsburgh 
on February 25, and [tentatively] it 
will screen on campus on February 
29. Hale has been one of the pri
mary liaisons between the 
University and Paramount through
out the entire filming process.
The on-campus Wonder Boys 
showings are the result of an agree
ment made last spring between the 
student body and Paramount. 
Because Paramount had used all of 
their agreed upon filming days, the 
University refused to allow them to 
return to campus. Paramount 
agreed to pay the University a sum 
of money not less than $40,000 and 
they also promised an on-campus 
screening that would coincide with 
the national release of the picture.
According to Lisa DeFrank-Cole, 
the Coordinator of Student 
Activities, the two on-campus 
screenings will be held on one 
evening and students with valid 
CMU identification will be able to 
acquire tickets on a first-come, firstserved basis prior to the screening.

attendance from CMU students
Thursdays Job Fair offered many opportunities for students seeking full-time 
jobs and internships.

Junior Staffwriter
On Thursday, February 10, stu
dents and employers gathered in 
Rangos Hall for Job Fair 2000. The 
College of Humanities and Social 
Sciences and the Heinz School co
sponsored the fair in an attempt to 
allow students to interact with
employers and increase their aware
ness about the job search process.
We work hard to bring a good 
mix of employers to the job fair so 
that we can serve both social science 
and humanities students and the 
Heinz School students as well," said 
Anna Houck, assistant to the Dean of 
H&SS and primary organizer of the 
fair. Houck has worked since the fall 
to research companies and secure 
employers for the fair.
The fair brought recruiters from 
over 40 different companies and 
organizations. New employers such 
as History Associates, CDNOW 
Online, Lifesteps, and Zefer were 
welcome additions that further 
increased the diversity of employ
ers, said Beth Miller, H&SS Career 
Consultant and an organizer of the 
fair. Miller helped to prepare stu
dents for the event in the weeks 
prior to the fair through rsum cri
tique appointments and interview 
preparation.
In addition to the recruiters, there 
were rsum drops, career-related 
databases, and Info Fest. Info Fest 
included a collection of information 
on topics such as majors, scholar
ships, graduate school, and study 
abroad.
There was a table for every H&SS 
department featuring relevant 
Career Center books, job options, 
and other information. Career 
Center staff members were available 
to answer questions and provide 
demonstrations of the Career 
Centers databases.
Brian Cooke, a junior IDS major, 
found the fair to be useful in his job 
search. Ive met quite a few compa
nies that seem really interested in 
me, said Cooke.

Housing plans remodeling 
for campus residence halls
by Sara Stille
News Editor
Residence halls, such as Donner 
; and Hamerschlag House, will soon 
receive makeovers. Improvements 
will be made to several buildings 
furniture, carpet, lounge areas, and 
kitchens.
The most immediate work will be 
done in Donner. Michael Murphy, 
the Dean of Student Affairs, is work
ing with residents of the dorm to 
come up with a definite plan for 
improvements to the Reading 
Room. The primary vision is for a 
room that has more of a family resi
dential feel, said Murphy.
As of now, the plans for the 
Reading Room include putting in 
lighter curtains, higher-grade car
pet, more substantive library tables 
and chairs, and couches and chairs 
more like a family living room. Ideas 
for better lighting and the addition 
of plants, artwork, and photographs 
are also being discussed.
Lisa Groft, the Assistant Director 
for Facilities for Housing Services, is 
also involved in the planning of the 
remodeling of Donner and various 
other residence halls on campus.
She is currently working on 
improvements to the recreation 
room, dining room, kitchen, and TV 
lounge with the design firm RSH 
Interiors, SDC, and students.
The recreation room on the Alevel of Donner will receive better 
lighting, a new floor, and wall treat
ments. New appliances, a garbage 
disposal, and cabinets will be added 
to the kitchen, and the dining room i 
with' new carpet, furniture, and ; 
draperies will be designed for multij 
purpose use.
Changes will also be made to the ^ 
TV room on the first floor. Were 
trying to lay it out according to stu
dent needs. We want to design the 
space so that it is comfortable to be 
in, said Groft. She said that the idea 
of adding a half-wall with some 
sound-proofing was a possibility, in

Carnegie Mellon University and NASA 
at Ames have recently signed a 
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) 
to start exploring the possibility of creat
ing a branch campus on a vast piece of 
land located in Silicon Valley on a former 
Air Force field, Moffett Field, in 
Mountain View, California.
The MOU was signed by Carnegie 
Mellon President Jared Cohon and NASA 
Ames Research Center Director Henry 
McDonald to announce the planning of a 
potential campus in Silicon Valley. We 
are very early in this. There is no com
mitment in CMU and Silicon Valley to do 
anything. We are in the phase of explor
ing, said Cohen.
From this project, CMU plans to gain 
recognition as well as the attention of the 
2,500 alumni now located in Silicon 
Valley. We want recognition that CMU is 
famous in the computer science industry.
There are many who never heard of it, 
said James Morris, dean of computer sci
ence. Both President Cohon and Dean 
Morris believe a presence in Silicon 
Valley is a very important contribution to 
this goal.
According to President Cohon, NASA 
has two interests in their reasons to 
approach Carnegie Mellon. One would 
be to expand their research in 
Information Technology (IT). NASA 
wants to expand Ames and sought us 
because of our outstanding technology. 
NASA [also has an] interest in seeing the 
field developspecially into a campus 
area for research education as well as to 
service research in Silicon Valley, said 
Cohon.
There would be more internships avail
able to CMU students and richer net
working. It would create a new para
digm for education, said Cohon. Certain 
links could evolve between CMU and 
Ames in subjects such as astrobiology, 
aerospace robotics, aviatary systems,

DVD software causes controversy
by Laine Towey
Assistant News Editor
DVD Content Scrambling 
System (DeCSS) software, which 
lets users circumvent the Content 
Scrambling System used to 
encrypt DVDs, has recently come 
under fire at Carnegie Mellon 
University. Two web pages have 
been the target of either cam
paigns or requests to take the 
information off of the Internet.
On February 4, Computing 
Services received a cease-anddesist email concerning the DeCSS 
software that Dr, David Touretzky, 
a senior research scientist in the 
Computer Science department,
was distributing on his web page. 
The email was from the Motion 
Picture Association of America 
(MPAA), and maintained that 
DeCSS is an unlawful circumven
tion device. The email also 
demanded that Touretzky remove 
the software from the web site.
A CMU student was also found 
to be distributing DeCSS software 
on his own website, and Student 
Affairs has asked him to remove it. 
Rather than fight the potential 
lawsuit, we will simply ask the that 
student no longer distribute this 
software. Its the opinion of our 
attorney that this software has no 
legitimate value except to copy 
copyrighted material, said Paul 
Fowler, the Associate Dean of
Student Affairs.
Touretzky said that he doesnt 
yet know what he is going to do 
about the material on his web site. 
However, he says that the case is 
about the first Amendment ... my 
position is that my web page is 
entirely legal... legally, I can keep 
it up.
The legal issues of the DeCSS 
software are quite complex. By 
decrypting DVDs, proponents of 
the software claim that it makes it 
possible to view movies on com
puters with Linux systems. There 
have been various legal rulings, 
however, that have stated that 
DeCSS is a prohibited circumven
tion device, and thus, according

Charles Schulz,Peanuts creator, dies
SAN FRANCISCO (AP)  
Peanuts creator Charles M. 
Schulz died on Saturday, turning 
his farewell note in Sunday papers 
into an epitaph for both a comic 
strip and its creator.
Schulz was 77, and died in his 
sleep at about 9:45 pm at his home 
in Santa Rosa, said his son, Craig 
Schulz.
He-was diagnosed with colon 
cancer and suffered a series of 
small strokes during emergency 
abdominal surgery in November 
1999, and announced his retire
ment a few weeks afterward.
Schulz had seemed fine earlier in 
the day and had gone to his daughter Jill Transkis -home in Santa 
Rosa. Only his wife, Jeannie, was 
with him when he died, Craig 
Schulz said.
His wildly popular Peanuts 
made its debut on Oct. 2,1950. The 
travails of the little round-headed 
kid and his pals eventually ran in 
more than 2,600 newspapers, 
reaching millions of readers in 75 
countries.
Over the years, the Peanuts gang 
became a part of American popular 
culture, delivering gentle humor 
spiked with a childs-eye view of 
human foibles.
Sergio Aragones, a Mad maga
zine cartoonist and friend for more 
than 30 years, called Schulz a true 
cartoonist.
In a couple of centuries when 
people talk about American artists, 
hell be one of the very few remem
bered, Aragones said.
And when they talk about comic 
strips, probably his will be the only 
one ever mentioned.
One of the most endearing quali
ties of Peanuts was its constancy.
The long-suffering Charlie
Brown still faced misfortune with a 
mild Good grief! Tart-tongued 
Lucy still handed out advice at a 
nickel a pop, a joke that started as a 
parody of a lemonade stand. And 
Snoopy, Charlie Browns wise-butweird beagle, still took the occa
sional flight of fancy back to the 
skies of World War I and his rivalry 
with the Red Baron.
Schulz was born in St. Paul, 
Minn., on Nov. 26, 1922, and stud
ied art after he saw a Do you like to 
draw? ad.
He was drafted into the Army in 
1943 and sent to the European 
theater, although he saw little 
combat.
After the war, he did lettering for 
a church comic book, taught art 
and sold cartoons to the Saturday 
Evening Post. His first feature, Lil 
Folks, was developed for the St. 
Paul Pioneer Press in 1947. In 1950, 
it was sold to a syndicate and the 
named changed to Peanuts, even 
though, he recalled later, he didnt 
much like the name.
Although he remained largely a 
private person, the strip brought 
Schulz international fame. He won 
the Reuben Award, comic arts 
highest honor, in 1955 and 1964. In 
1978, he was named International 
Cartoonist of the Year, an award 
voted by 700 comic artists around 
the world.
He was to have been honored 
with a lifetime achievement award 
on May 27 at the National 
Cartoonists Society convention in 
New York.
In his later years, he spent much 
of his time at his Redwood Empire 
Ice Arena in Santa Rosa, about 60 
miles north of San Francisco, where 
he frequently played hockey or 
sipped coffee at the rinks Warm 
Puppy snack bar.
Peanuts, meanwhile, had 
remained an intensely personal 
effort. He had had a clause in his 
contract dictating the strip had to 
end with his death. While battling 
cancer, he opted to retire it right 
then, saying he wanted to focus on 
his health and family without the 
worry of a daily deadline.
Why do musicians compose 
symphonies and poets write 
poems? he once said. They do it 
because life wouldnt have any 
meaning for them if they didnt. 
That's why I draw cartoons. Its my 
life.
Reform party meeting results in rumble
National News
NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP)  In 
what would be his last act as 
Reform Party national chairman, 
Jack Gargan asked the warring fac
tions to stand together for bigger 
matters.
The nations unity, for example, 
as outlined in the Pledge of 
Allegiance. The 145 members of 
the National Committee rose, 
placed their hands over their 
hearts, and promised to remain one 
nation, indivisible.
Then chaos erupted at the 
Reform Party meeting at the 
Airport Marriotts Capitol confer
ence room. The factions had 
arrived ready to rumble.
The moment of silence ended in 
a firefight of insults, with Gargan 
at the podium, shouting over the 
din that the meeting had been 
called illegally and his opponents 
at their own microphones loudly 
beginning the process to oust 
him, with some chanting Out! 
Out! Out!
Dale Barlow, a Gargan ally, 
jumped onstage in front of Gargan 
and hollered at his detractors: I am 
ashamed of this party!1
Shut up, Dale! someone in the 
audience spat back.
More reminiscent of the Jerry 
Springer show than C-Span, bounc
ers helped Barlow off the stage and 
routinely separated arguing 
Reform Party members.
The yelling, hollering, and even 
a shoving match between a 
woman who tried to unplug 
Gargans microphone and another 
who shoved her to the floor 
prompted an anonymous call to 
the police. Eight officers threat
ened to shut the proceedings 
down unless officials were able to 
control them.
Such was the long-anticipated 
effort by the faction loyal to Ross 
Perot to oust Gargan, an ally of the 
partys major office-holder, 
Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura. The 
political fisticuffs stretched outside
Nashville.
A day earlier, Ventura quit the 
national party, calling it dysfunc
tional.
Ultimately, Gargan was over
whelmingly rejected by 109 mem
bers of the 162-member national 
commitee, enough to depose him. 
Gargan took to the microphone 
and called the proceedings a 
sham.
Perots allies booed him and 
walked out.
Sit down! Order! yelled a man 
in the crowd. Sit down and be 
courteous for Christs sake!'
James Sheehan of Rhode Island 
rose and asked his fellow commit
tee members to focus once again on 
larger issues.
Our children and grandchildren 
will not recall who was wrong and 
who was right in the Reform Party 
in Nashville, Tenn., in the year 
2000,'' Sheehan said. They will 
look back at us and they will say, 
They failed us.

11 jets with tail 
glitch grounded
LOS ANGELES (AP)  Airlines 
temporarily grounded 11 more jets 
Saturday under a government order 
to examine tail wings for a problem 
that may have caused an Alaska 
Airlines jet to crash two weeks ago.
Since Thursday, at least 21 planes 
have been found to have irregulari
ties with tail wing jackscrews, the 
two-foot-long rods that drive the 
stabilizers that keep planes level, 
according to numbers from the 
Federal Aviation Administration 
and airlines.
The jackscrew recovered from the 
submerged wreckage of Alaska 
Airlines Flight 261 had damaged 
threads and metal shavings.
The National Transportation 
Safety Bureau has not determined 
whether jackscrew damage caused 
the Jan. 31 crash that killed all 88 
people aboard, but after similar 
damage was found on other Alaska 
Airlines jets, the FAA ordered all air
lines to inspect their MD-80s, MD90s, Boeing 717s and DC-9s - about 
1,200 planes in all.
In a statement Saturday, the FAA 
said 13 planes had been grounded 
for jackscrew problems, though 
some were back in service. Others
were found to have metal shavings 
on the jackscrew or other irregulari
ties, such as metallic residue in 
screw grease or a lack of lubricant.
The significance of the findings 
will not be known until a detailed 
inspection of the parts can be 
made, the FAA said. These are ini
tial reports and the FAA believes it is 
premature to draw any conclusions 
from them.
Airlines said even more planes 
have been grounded than the 13 the 
FAA announced.
Alaska Airlines spokesman Jack 
Ware said his company had ground
ed eight aircraft, including four on 
Saturday. The FAA said Alaska 
Airlines had reported four planes 
with problems. Similarly, Northwest 
Airlines reported replacing the 
jackscrews of three aircraft, includ
ing two Saturday, but the FAA said 
that airline reported problems with 
only one of its aircraft.
FAA spokesman Eliot Brenner said 
the agency is looking specifically for 
slivers of metal along jackscrews 
while airline mechanics are report
ing anything unusual they find.
The FAA has ordered that the 
inspections be completed by 
Monday and gave airlines until 
Wednesday to report their findings, 
Brenner said.
Nine indicted in 
La. jail takeover
NEW ORLEANS (AP)  Eight 
Cubans and a Bahamian accused of  
holding hostages during the six-day 
takeover of the St. Martin Parish Jail - 
in December have been indicted on 
state kidnapping charges that carry 
mandatory life sentences.
Only three  two Cubans and the : 
Bahamian  will immediately face 
the charges because the rest of the 
Cubans were sent back to their 
home country after the standoff.
The indictment on Friday will 
ensure that the six could be arrested ; 
and tried if they ever re-enter this 
country, District Attorney Phil!,'. 
Haney said Saturday.
The prison warden, three 
deputies and several female inmates i< 
were taken hostage Dec. 13 at the - 
jail in St. Martinville, about 100 *- 
miles west of New Orleans.
The six who were returned to r 
Cuba were jailed after their arrival. 'i,1 
Cuban officials said they planned to 8 
investigate the case. 
The hostage-takers said they * 
rebelled because they had served 
their prison sentences but were* 
being held indefinitely awaiting 
deportation.

Cyanide spill hits 
Yugoslav town
BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP)  In 
what may be Europes worst envi
ronmental disaster since Chernobyl, 
a cyanide spill contaminating a 
major river has moved into 
Yugoslavia and destroyed all life in 
the water, local officials said 
Saturday.
The spill originated in northwest 
Romania, near the border town of 
Oradea, where a dam at the Baia 
Mare gold mine overflowed Jan. 30 
and caused cyanide, to pour into 
streams. From there, the polluted 
water flowed west into the Tisa 
River in neighboring Hungary and 
then on into Yugoslavia.
A cyanide solution is used to sepa
rate gold ore from surrounding 
rock.
Eighty percent of the fish in the 
Tisa have died since the contami
nant entered the country two days 
ago, said Mayor Atila Juhas of the 
northern town Senta.
By Saturday noon, the concentra
tion of cyanide in the water at the 
point where the Tisa enters 
Yugoslavia from Hungary was 0.07' 
milligrams per liter, down from 0.13 
milligrams several hours earlier, the 
Tanjug news agency reported.
But the worst-polluted part of the 
flow was moving south, and more 
serious damage was expected later 
when the polluted waters reach the 
Danube River, probably early 
Sunday. The spill was moving at 
about 2.5 mph.
The Tisa is a dead river. All life in 
it, from algae to trout, has been 
destroyed, said Istvan Backulin, the 
mayor of another affected town in 
the north. The spill is leaving noth
ing alive.
Restaurants in the region have 
already removed fish from their 
menus, and the alarm has spread 
south as far as the capital, Belgrade, 
which lies on the Danube some 80 
miles to the south.
Juhas said drinking water would 
be safe since supplies come from 
wells far enough from the river. 
However, wildlife in the area near 
the river is in serious danger, he 
said.
Local ecologists said it could take 
years before marine life reappears 
in the Tisa, according to the Beta 
news agency.
17 killed in India 
state election
PATNA, India (AP)  Violence 
marred an election in one of Indias 
largest and poorest states Saturday, 
with land mine explosions and gun
fire killing 17 people  mostly 
police.
The three-phased election in the 
northeastern state of Bihar featured 
a race for the chief ministers job 
that included one of Indias most 
colorful leaders.
In the worst of the five land mine 
explosions in Bihar, eight policemen 
were killed in a rural area Friday 
night. In four mine attacks 
Saturday, six police and two poll 
workers were killed and sixothers 
were wounded.
One policeman was shot dead in a 
gun battle after one of the explo
sions.
In the last state assembly election 
in 1995, more than 70 people were 
killed in clashes among rival politi
cal activists or in battles with police.
More than half the 20 million eli
gible voters cast their ballots in the 
first day of the election for the state 
government that the colorful Laloo
Prasad Yadav has headed for 11 ^ 
years.
Police put on a show of force and  
authorized local forces to open fire i 
on political vandals. But despite the ' 
heavy security, unidentified gunmen shot at a candidate in central 
Bihar, seriously injuring him, the * 
United News of India reported.
At least 36 of the more than 3,000 " 
candidates have criminal records or 
are facing serious charges in court, 
police said.
Australian girl 
rescued from 
croc attack
DARWIN, Australia (AP)  A* 
young girl escaped from the jaws of" 
an 8-foot crocodile when her little . 
brother distracted the beast by grab-' 
bing its tail, their father said 
Tuesday.
Roy Harrington said his daughter 1 
Martina, 8, and son Paul, 5, were " 
hunting for turtles on Saturday in a 
creek in Australias Northern 
Territory, when the animal seized 
her and began dragging her into the 
water.
I could see it pulling her down,1 , 
Harrington told reporters. PaulD 
grabbed the tail of the croc and he , 
threw his head up  that gave^ 
Martina a chance to get her feet out; 
of his mouth.
Harrington said he then attacked M 
and killed the crocodile with an ax. 
Martina was treated at a clinic for M 
bite wounds and released, he said.
Saltwater crocodiles live in watera 
ways throughout Australias tropical  
north.
The reptiles have been protected 
in Australia since the early 1970s : 
and their numbers have burgeoned.

ing. DeFrank-Cole wants to make sure 
that the CMU community is wellinformed before the ticket-offering 
begins.
While a firm date for the screening has 
not been secured. Hale explained that 
Paramount was unable to offer a pre
release screening because of stipulations 
agreed upon between Paramount and the 
films director, Curtis Hanson, and lead 
actor Michael Douglas. While filming 
Wonder Boys in Pittsburgh, Hanson and 
Douglas discovered a decrepit Pittsburgh 
theatre that they wanted to benefit from 
the films Pittsburgh premiere and decid
ed to hold it there.
There was some confusion amongst 
students as to whether or not the film 
would actually be seen on campus. Hale 
explained that he has been involved over 
the last two weeks in working to ensure 
that the movie would come to campus. 
He also rejected speculation that the uni
versity would receive additional money 
from Paramount in exchange for the nul
lification of the agreement to show the 
movie on campus. However, both 
DeFrank-Cole and Hale were unsure of 
why Paramount was allowing the film to 
be shown at CMU only twice. As of 
Friday, Paramount and National 
Amusements had not confirmed a date 
for the on-campus screening. Paramount 
Pictures and National Amusements could 
not be reached for comment.

Morris said the idea started out as 
a hotel for students, but with the 
help of alumni the idea grew. NASA 
has also signed a similar agreement 
with Stanford, and the University of 
Santa Cruz is also expressing an 
interest. The plan is to have multi
ple universities participate and have 
each institution do what they do 
best, said Cohon.
According to Morris, the educa
tion system in Silicon Valley would 
allow more interaction with the 
companies in the area. An example 
would be students receiving credit 
for consulting projects. We have 
the ability to be right there, said 
Morris. Companies would not have 
to worry about the long distance 
that students have to travel to work 
on projects.
This project is intended for stu
dents at CMU in all departments. 
Students would only attend the uni
versity for approximately a semes
ter. We can offer students of all 
levels, graduate students as well as 
undergraduates, a semester in 
Silicon Valley, said Morris. One 
possibility would have resident 
facilities for students to live in while 
researching, said Cohon. Morris 
mentioned that this project is also 
aimed in a practical context at pro
viding education for the people who 
are already working and want to 
continue their studies. The school 
would still be prestigious and the 
people taking these classes would 
need basic qualifications. Some 
classes that are planned to be

September include software engi
neering and executive business. The 
program would not just benefit 
Carnegie Mellon, but it would also 
benefit the industry in Silicon 
Valley. It would provide the commu
nity with unique CMU educational 
programs such as e-commerce and 
software engineering. It would also 
give the industry easier access to 
CMU students as well as faculty and 
research. Carnegie Mellon may even 
provide Internet service for local 
residents.The project of creating a branch 
campus is being used to enhance the 
teaching at CMU. According to both 
Morris and Cohen, it is not meant to 
detract anything from the 
Pittsburgh campus. The research 
and teaching will be complemen
tary, not competitive. It will be to 
raise CMUs visibility in Silicon 
Valley.
There have been concerns, 
though, about the branch campus 
drawing attention away from 
Pittsburgh. We dont want to dis
rupt the things going on here. Wedont want professors and students  
running out permanently. We can., 
get energy from Silicon Valleyrather than us draining energy,, 
said Morris.
I dont think they should get car
ried away with it and they cant treat , 
it like just a building. Im worried . 
that they may raise tuition because t 
of it, said Christopher Tyler, a ; 
sophomore mechanical engineer.
It sounds like a great idea for stu
dents who are interested in getting . 
some experience in the industry,  
said Noah OConnor, a sophomore 
in CIT.
It is anticipated that this partner* 
ship will benefit the Pittsburgh area 
as well as Pennsylvania. It will help .. 
encourage people to open up more . 
companies such as Ciscos in the  
future, said Morris. President-. 
Cohon says that the project depends .. 
on ambition and it will take many 
years to develop a complete campus . 
We want to start small and slow, , 
but the idea is to have it big and suecessful, said Morris.

Wonder Boys showings should accommodate everyone
Wonder Boys will return to CMU in a cou
ple of weeks, but, as with the filming last 
year, many students may not be too excited 
about it. Two showings of the film will be 
allowed, allowing only 800 lucky students 
to actually view it.
. Per the agreement reached last spring, 
which allowed the film crew to return for 
extra filming after their allotted time, 
CMU has been given permission to show 
Wonder Boys on February 29, just four days 
after it opens in theaters. While this event 
is certainly welcome, the exact terms of 
the showing leave much to be desired.
Like other on-campus movies, the film 
will be shown in McConomy auditorium, 
but as an extra concession, tickets will be 
free with a CMU ID. While these terms will 
be agreeable to those students who get in 
line early in the morning, most of the stu
dent body will be left out in the cold. This 
limit on the number of showings is com
pletely unacceptable.
Nearly everyone who was on campus 
last spring felt the effects of the filming 
sessions in one way or another. An over
whelming number of students voted in an 
e-mail referendum near the end of the 
school year to allow some extra filming. 
However, they were under the impression 
that they would have the opportunity to 
see a special showing as a reward for their 
patience with the disturbances caused by 
the filming. That opportunity is still there, 
but only for those students who can wait in 
line all day rather than attend class.
Typical weekend movies run a mini
mum of three showings, often more when 
there is a large demand, such as the five 
shows that were required for American 
Beauty on January 29. Having been 
filmed at CMU, Wonder Boys is sure to 
draw a similar demand, if not larger. Yet 
only one sixth of the entire student body 
will be able to see the movie filmed in 
their own backyard.
Accepting terms which satisfy such a 
small fraction of the student body is irre
sponsible of the administration and stu
dent government. With an upcoming 
worldwide release, Paramount has little to 
lose by allowing the entire student body to 
see the film for free. Limiting the showing 
makes no sense, except as a means to 
increase interest in the film with those stu
dents who wouldnt get to see it on cam
pus, so they would have to pay to go see it 
in theaters.
. Because of Paramount Pictures stance, 
the responsibility lies with the Student 
Government and University Relations to 
negotiate better terms for the films oncampus showing. Student Government is 
responsible for protecting the interests of 
the student body. In this case, they must 
attempt to convince Paramount to allow 
more screenings of the movie at CMU. 
University Relations has been a liason 
between the Paramount and the communi
ty throughout the entire filming. Itshould 
use any bargaining power it has to serve 
the campus.Campus community must curtail environmental abuses
The amount of waste being produced in 
on-campus dining facilities is in need of 
immediate student body attention and 
action. Something must be done to find a 
cheap and environmentally friendly way to 
solve the problem of trash buildup from 
these eateries. In addition, students, facul
ty,,, and staff must start caring about envi
ronmental issues.
Dne specific problem is the styrofoam 
which is used for food containers. A walk 
around campus shortly after lunch-time 
will tell the story. Heaps of Styrofoam 
boxes are piled one on top of the other, fill
ing up waste baskets to the point where 
they overflow.
The University already has working sys
tems in place to deal with waste, but 
those systems do not adequately address 
the use of Styrofoam. Between July 1998 
and June 1999 Facility Management 
Services (FMS) reports that Carnegie 
Mellon recycled over 435 tons of post
consumer material. This number can be 
improved. There are organizations on 
campus, such as the Environmental 
Practices Committee and Earth that work 
to improve the existing waste manage
ment and recycling programs already 
instituted on campus.
There is work being done to convert 
Schatz Dining Room from Styrofoam 
plates to flatware. This type of effort is 
exactly what must happen around campus. 
The new food court in Newell-Simon Hall 
has made the move to paper products in an 
effort to cut down on Styrofoam usage. 
There is also a pilot program being devel
oped to turn food refuse leftover from din
ing facilities into compost (both food and 
paper). Next week a council will hold a 
meeting covering all the above issues and 
more. Students should get involved in the 
process and there should be continuing 
improvements suggested for the 
Styrofoam problem.
One possible alternative to Styrofoam is 
the re-usable container. The plastic con
tainers most students already have at 
home make good alternatives to the 
Styrofoam boxes currently used in campus 
dining facilities. Using re-usable contain
ers reduces waste and the amount of 
money needed for food serving supplies. 
Currently, The Fluted Mushroom will 
allow students to bring in their own con
tainers. Other vendors should follow suit, 
and post signs that encourage students to 
bring in plastic. Perhaps vendors could 
offer a discount to students who bypass 
paper and Styrofoam as an incentive to 
reduce waste.
Carrying around containers and clean
ing them may be a hassle. But helping the 
environment and saving some spare 
change makes it worthwhile. There is also 
the possible health risk of possible cross
contamination due to improperly sanitized 
containers. Yet places like Brueggers 
Bagels and Starbucks allow customers to 
reuse their mugs  and offer discounts for 
customers that do.
Using reusable containers and other 
efforts to help the environment are feasi
ble but students need to put forth the 
effort to make them work.

EU isolates Austria for reactionary leader
Blake Engel
In Austria, a newly elected government 
composed primarily of far-right parties is 
treading on thin ice. The Austrian Peoples 
Party and the Austrian Freedom Party each 
now hold 52 seats of the 183 in Parliament.
Throughout the ordeal, the press has 
focused on Freedom Party leader Jorg 
Haider, an outspoken and smooth-talking 
force in his party. Haider was governor of
the southern Austrian state of Carinthia 
until 1991, when he was removed from 
office for his approval of Nazi policy.
It was during his term there that Haider 
made a series of statements regarding Nazi 
policy. He praised the orderly employment 
policy of the German National Socialists in 
the Third Reich and called the Waffen SS 
(essentially Nazi henchmen) decent peo
ple of good character.
Since the new, democratically-elected 
government was sworn in earlier this 
month by President Thomas Kleistl, 
protests have raged across Europe. In addi
tion to the Viennese, Parisians and
Berliners have also taken to the streets,1 
calling Haider a fascist and a collabora
tor.
Additionally, the European Union has 
taken steps away from the Austrian rightwing coalition by setting diplomatic sanc
tions against the central European country. 
The United States and Israel have both tem
porarily withdrawn' their ambassadors 
from Vienna.
Amidst all the confusion is the question: 
why does President Thomas Kleistl not 
remove the potential threat to human 
rights and liberal values? And why did he

Inefficient pipe construction mirrors roadwork
Sean Mintus
Those of you who actually go to class 
might have noticed the newest Appalachian 
foothill that has materialized in the middle 
of campus. Upon returning from break, I 
was somewhat surprised by this, but taking 
into account the fact that I am usually 
unable to walk ten paces on this campus 
without running into a major architectural 
or terraforming operation, I thought it 
nothing more than some new structure, 
and ignored it for the first few weeks of 
class.
However, after noticing that no matter 
how much hustle and bustle occurred 
around the landmass, nothing really 
changed, I became curious and decided to 
investigate. So I bravely scaled the ominous 
sod cliffs and discovered a most incredible 
phenomenon, one that would change the 
face of Carnegie Mellon forever: a pipe.
Seriously though, a pipe is exciting. After 
a rigorous inquisition (asking the nearest 
guy with a hardhat), I gathered that this 
was the legendary steam pipe. The same 
pipe that, when completely repaired (after 
a mere forty or fifty additional years of 
work), should provide students with a valu
able commodity that has, to this point, 
eluded them: (brace yourself) hot water for 
the showers!
Upon realizing that this pipe replacement 
was indeed the duty being undertaken, I 
began to worry that the audacious task of 
digging a really big hole, dropping a hollow 
chunk of metal into it, and pushing the dirt 
back into the hole might prove to be too 
much for the meagerly-staffed, 186-man 
construction crew. After all, moving dirt is 
hard. Ask any mole.
All fears quickly subsided, however, 
when I learned through careful, intense, 
and prolonged observation (watching them 
work) that our very own Cut Construction 
Crew, or CCC, has adopted the coveted 
PENND0T labor procedure.
For those of you who are unfamiliar with 
PENND0T (PENNsylvania Department Of 
Transportation) and their methods, a quick 
explanation is in order. The system perfect
ed by PENNDOT, and now implemented by 
our very own university crew, consists of 
having one, and no more than one worker 
perform some action (preferably unrelated 
to the overall proposed goal of the project) 
while being watched closely by no fewer 
than six of his fellow workers, all of whom 
must be standing in a circular fashion 
around the work area, discussing sports 
and enjoying some sort of jelly-filled pastry. 
During the course of the day, workers rotate 
tirelessly through this system, ensuring that 
everyone enjoys plenty of work and donuts, 
at least until lunchtime, when heavier con
struction implements (bear claws) are 
brought in.
Now, to the untrained eye, this procedure 
might seem lazy or ineffective, but after
growing up riding and driving on the fine 
roads (minefields) maintained by PEN
NDOT, and carefully scrutinizing the CMU 
crew, I can assure you that these operations 
are indeed effective.
Furthermore, I believe the CMU crew to 
be dedicated to doing a meticulously accu
rate job, while providing for the physical 
and mental well-being of its members, and 
ensuring that the Cut is once again 
returned to its previous splendor and pul
chritude, and they get paid by the hour.
I am worried, however, that the swift 
progress observed at other campus con
struction sites might give my beloved CCC a 
bad name. A worse one than I have given it, 
anyway. I have no doubt that the additions 
to Baker and Posner Hall and the work 
being done on CFA are being rushed to 
completion without enough consideration 
for things like indolence and baked goods.
Happily enough, the CCC might escape 
this ridicule thanks to the fact that the cam
pus could easily be mistaken for one big 
construction site, maldng the activities of a 
few individual groups unnoticeable. Cross 
your fingers, ldds.
So if youre strolling along the Cut, and 
happen upon one of these brave, sugarcoated hole-diggers, say hello. Be friend
ly. Introduce yourself. Even go ahead and 
shake his hand. Just ask him to wipe off the 
jelly first.

Far-right Austrian government disturbs world leaders
From AUSTRIA, page 6 
ever allow them to enter office? He does, after 
all, have the power to overturn a popular vote.
Put simply, he is obligated to uphold the 
democracy.
Austrians have been under the same Social 
Democratic rule for nearly 30 years. During 
this time, popular dissatisfaction with the 
government bureaucracy and the fat pay
checks that government officials take home 
grew. The situation was volatile.
In the early 1930s, the German economic 
situation had worsened enough for its citizens 
to listen to Hitlers anti-Semitism and policies 
of hate. It was all too easy to turn anger with 
economic hardships into hate against racial 
minorities.
It is very possible that Austrias current 
response to economic and political dissatisfac
tion has resulted in a similar reaction to that 
of the Germans when Hitler captured power 
in 1933.
And if that is the case, the obligation to take 
action does not rest with President Thomas 
Kleistl. It does not rest with the EU, as they 
themselves are beginning to practice the very 
isolationism they are trying to condemn. And 
it does not rest with either of the right-wing 
parties.
It rests with the Austrian people, and specif
ically, those among them who are fed up with 
the Social Democratic government and who 
will not tolerate a government led by ultra
conservatives.
In any Western country, there are a wide 
spectrum of political views. Many of these 
views wind up underrepresented. But in the 
face of xenophobia and racism, Austrians with
opposing views must express them even more 
loudly than they have in the past few weeks.
Street protests are a call to the cause, but 
not a means to end the conflict. It is the 
responsibility of Austrian politicians  be 
they state governors, city council members, or 
even registered party members  to join 
forces and call for a government that can pre
side in peace.
Hitler proved that the power of the group is 
infinitely stronger than the power of the indi
vidual. He understood the psychology of the 
masses and latched onto it to spread hate. But 
it is strength in numbers that the Austrians 
need in order to break free of the rule of the 
Freedom Party and the Peoples Party.
Moreover, the Vatican has taken its all-toofamiliar stance on radicalism: just wait and 
see. While their policy of non-judgment is
consistent with Christian belief, it turned out 
to be an embarrassing and disgraceful mis
take in World War II.
Perhaps a compromise between the EUs 
and the Vaticans reactions is appropriate. To 
condemn the new ruling powers is as thick
headed as it is to pledge non-judgment. The 
radical parties offer but one solution to 
Austrian displeasure with the government. 
World powers need to actively try to under
stand the position the Austrian people take on 
the matter, and based on that, understand if 
this attempt to satisfy the Austrians past 
unhappiness with their government is the best 
one.

Valentines day represents evils of commercialism, superficialness
LaRita Hamilton
Are you one of those people who loathes 
Valentines Day? Does the sight of candy 
boxes shaped like hearts and little stuffed ani
mals bearing goofy messages give you hives? 
In many years past I have suffered from Ihate-V-day Syndrome. This year Im taking 
things into my own hands and you 
should too.
Im not suggesting that you simply get over 
the notion that Valentines Day sucks. I would 
never ask anyone to do that. Everyone is enti
tled to their own opinion and you just happen 
to be right. That being said, I want you to 
embrace your feelings of ill will. Dont deny 
it. When people suggest that perhaps you are 
a bit bitter, respond by saying, So?
There are lots of things for single people 
and people who hate their girlfriends or 
boyfriends, to do on Valentines Day. Some of 
the activities are sinister, and others are 
harmless. The point is for you to have a 
great day.
When your best friend gets that pound of 
fudge, remind him or her that chocolate may 
make them break out and then eat it all your
self. Finger the delicate petals of the red roses 
that were delivered to their dorm and say, 
Gee, its such a shame that in a couple of 
days these flowers will be dead. Do you think 
that symbolizes your relationship?
The key to remaining calm and cool is 
to remember who and what is important in 
your life. The answer is: You. This is your 
day. Be as selfish as you like. You deserve it. 
You work hard and get good grades. 
Yourea sharp dresser and you have tons 
of personality.
So why am I single on this day of love, you 
may ask yourself. It is-because' others are sim
ply too blind to see all of the things you have 
to offer; so to hell with them. You have plen
ty of things to do, like setting cuddly little 
stuffed animals aflame and flinging them 
from atop of high buildings. While that will 
get your message across, hanging them in 
effigy is just as effective and will not get you 
expelled for being a pyromaniac.
In addition,.think aboutall the money you 
will save when you buy candy on the day 
after V-Day. I suggest setting up a lawn chair
in any 24-hour drug store and just waiting for 
the stroke of midnight. Youll be able to get all 
of your favorite candies for half price.
If youre not single and you still hate this 
day of bliss, fake an illness and dont leave 
your room. In the weeks before V-Day make 
sure you bitch and moan about how broke 
you are. It will also win you some points if 
you mention that you think the day has 
become too commercialized.
Of all my arguments protesting Valentines 
Day, I think that commercialization is the 
most valid. Im starting to realize that telling 
people that I hate it Because I just do, is not 
very effective. Starting after New Years Day, 
every major supermarket, drug store and 
shopping mall appears to have been hosed 
down with Pepto-Bismol and then sprinkled 
with red heart shapes. I say heart shapes 
because real hearts dont look like that. If you 
don't believe me, check with the Biology 
Department. They will back me up. Or if that 
isn't possible, watch The Simpsons. Itchy and 
Scratchy are usually anatomically correct. 
God bless Matt Groening. Oh, and also, 
hearts are squishy things, so dont worry 
about it shattering if things dont go your 
way. If someone really walked all over your
heart, it would resemble the concentrated 
pulp of orange juice, only it would 
be red.
Candy doesnt prove your commitment to 
someone and I do have a point when I say 
that flowers die. You cant buy romance.
I suppose in saying that I hate Valentines 
Day Im saying that a long time ago, when I 
was a kid, someone didnt send me a card or 
candy and now, Im embittered. Actually, I 
was in the 5th grade and Joseph Chestnut, 
who I knew would be the love of my life, was 
coerced by all of the teachers in my grade to 
send me a Valentine. I didnt know it was 
insincere until my best friend Christina 
ruined it for me. There. Are you happy? Yes, I 
am bitter, and now you know why. If my ther
apist Has taught me anything, it is that what
ever is wrong with you now is because of 
what happened to you when you were a kid.
Whether you enjoy Valentine's Day or not, 
make the best of it. However you feel, 
embrace it.
LaRita Hamilton is a sophomore creative 
writing major. Have a Day, she says. You 
may send comments good or bad, but Im not 
going to read them,"she claims.

Ice hockey suffers 4-1 loss to Robert Morris, remains second in
by Erin Lucas
Staffwriter
With the playoffs quickly 
approaching, it has become clear 
that the Carnegie Mellon Ice 
Hockey Club has established itself 
as one of the dominant teams in the 
league. At this point, the club has 
two outstanding goaltenders, the 
number one-ranked defense in the 
league, and two strong offensive 
lines. This team looks to make a 
strong run for the championship 
next month.
Last weekend the Tartans were 
able to defeat Allegheny College on 
home ice. Allegheny has historically 
always been difficult for the 
Tartans, so it was an important win. 
However, the Tartans split the 
weekend with a 7-5 loss to fourthranked Edinboro on the following 
Sunday.
Last Friday night, Slippery Rock 
University, with whom the Tartans 
are tied for second place, hosted the 
Tartans at Bladerunners in
Cranberry. The Tartans struck first 
when scoring leader Rob Ready 
buried the puck behind the Slippery 
Rock netminder at 5:16 of the first 
period. The opposition was able to 
answer back a few minutes later, 
making the score even.
However, thanks to a goal from 
graduate student Esa Ylipahkala, 
the Tartans were able to take a 2-1 
lead into the second period. During 
this period, a Slippery Rock player 
was badly injured in what appeared 
to be an innocent looking play. The 
game was stopped for almost half an 
hour as Emergency Medical 
Services awaited the arrival of an 
ambulance. Preliminary reports 
said the Slippery Rock player will be 
okay.
Slippery Rock scored the only 
goal in the first half of the second 
period. However, the Tartans came 
alive in the last seven minutes of 
period, with goals from senior cap
tain Dan Grosso and doctoral stu
dent Jiri Schindler, who was able to 
score before being ejected for game 
misconduct.
Carnegie Mellon finished off 
Slippery Rock in the third period 
with a second unassisted goal from 
Ylipahkala. The final score of 5-2 
demonstrated the strength of this 
team on both ends of the ice.The 
skill of the Carnegie Mellon 
defensemen, coupled with consid
erable size, is why the Tartans 
defense is ranked number one with 
a goalsagainst average of 2.75 
goals per game.
This year the Tartans gained an 
additional outstanding goaltender 
with the acquisition of graduate stu
dent Ryan Henning. His record with 
the Tartans is a solid 9-0-0 with a 
goals-against average of 1.9 and a 
92 percent save percentage.
Saturday night Carnegie Mellon 
faced the best team in the league 
when it hosted Robert Morris 
College at Neville Ice arena. Robert 
Morris had a 12-1-1 record, with its 
only loss coming from a November 
12,1999 match-up against Carnegie 
Mellon.
The first period of play was rela
tively even. Both teams were
aggressive and maintained numer
ous scoring opportunities. Robert 
Morris had the first goal at 9:04, 
capitalizing on a two-man advan
tage. Three minutes later the 
Tartans made it on the board with a 
power-play goal from sophomore 
Eliot Minichiello assisted by junior 
Cliff Brangwynne and Chris 
Schmidt. The first period ended 
with a 1-1 tie.
Things began to deteriorate for 
the Tartans in the second as 
C&rnegie Mellon was given 10 min
utes worth of penalties, playing 
over half the period shorthanded. 
However, through good defensive 
play and goaltending by senior Gil 
Min, the potent Robert Morris 
offense was held to one power play, 
goal this period.
The third period started off badly 
for the Tartans as a flipped puck 
took a strange bounce into the 
Carnegie Mellon net. This fluke goal 
along with the eight minutes of 
power play for Robert Morris sealed 
their 4-1 victory.
In addition, Carnegie Mellon
defenseman Chris Killiam most like
ly broke his ankle blocking a shot. 
The Tartans will definitely feel his 
absence on defense.
In the standings, Carnegie Mellon 
is now ranked second, with a record

of 11-6-0 and 22 points. More;

Let NCAA players get down to business
Full Court Press
by Pete Patterson
I saw an interesting blurb in The 
Wall Street Journal this past week 
about college students leaving 
school early to enter the work force. 
The explosion of the computer 
industry has caused a shortage in 
the workforce, prompting many 
firms to reach into the college ranks 
to fill out their staffs.
The article cited $50,000-plus 
salaries and stock options as the 
enticements that convinced, stu
dents to forfeit their final years of 
school to enter the working world. 
The piece was written in an approv
ing tone, implying support of smart 
kids who saw an opportunity for 
success and grabbed on.
For the remainder of the week I 
watched the letters to the editor 
closely, expecting vile condemna
tions to arrive in droves. Surely peo
ple would fume about youngsters 
throwing away the opportunity to 
get a college degree, foregoing 
enlightenment for a few extra dol
lars.
Undoubtedly complaints would 
arise about the naive children leav
ing their collegiate shelter and 
entering the cruel world, for which 
they are woefully ill-prepared. 
Surprisingly, none of this happened. 
The deafening noise on the subject 
was silence.
A similar trend has been occur
ring in basketball throughout the 
past decade, but to a much different 
public reaction. Fans are outraged 
over the preponderance of fresh
men, sophomores, and, horrifically, 
high school seniors giving up their 
college eligibility to enter the NBA. 
Research has been frantically con
ducted to try to stem this trend, as 
many feel it stands to ruin the col
lege and pro games, not to mention 
the lives of the transgressors. Fans 
and coaches yearn for the good old 
days, when players could be count
ed on to stay in school for four years.
Why this double standard? Why 
should athletes be derided for cash
ing in on their opportunities while 
others are not? If anything, I think 
the argument for athletes coming 
out early is much more compelling. 
For one thing, they are practically
slave labor for a huge money-mak
ing machine: the NCAA. The cur
rent television contract for the 
NCAA tournament alone brings in 
billions dollars in revenue for the 
universities. The players, who are 
most responsible for this windfall, 
lose their eligibility if their coach 
buys them a hamburger.
Secondly, consider the amount of 
money a player stands to receive by 
turning pro. First round draft picks 
are guaranteed, by the NBA collec
tive bargaining agreement, a three 
year contract worth in excess of a 
million a year. And IS majors are 
applauded for taking a $60,000 
salary with a few pieces of stock that
Why should ath
letes be derided for 
cashing in on their 
opportunities... ? 
They are practically 
slave labor for a 
huge money-mak
ing machine: the 
NCAA.
may or may not be of any value?
Lastly, the argument that they are 
committing a mortal sin by giving 
up a free education is totally ludi
crous. Those who believe these 
players are driven by an inspiration 
to elevate their intelligence are 
badly mistaken. This is not a knock 
on athletes. I think its safe to say 
that for most students, college is a 
seen mainly as a mechanism to open 
career opportunities. If your goal is 
to be a professional basketball play
er, sticking out college and earning 
a degree in a totally unrelated field 
after already proving youre NBA 
material definitely doesnt appear 
very appealing.
Besides, if youre one of the few 
that actually do value a degree, 
nothing is stopping you from taking 
classes during the off-season to 
achieve this goal, as many profes
sional athletes, such as Michael 
Jordan and Emmitt Smith, already 
have done.
Despite all their blather about 
concern for innocent youths enter
ing the temptation-filled world of 
the NBA, and their fervent wish that 
our young athletes could take 
advantage of their academic oppor
tunities, I think fans anger is rooted 
in one feeling: selfishness.
Fans want their teams to be suc
cessful, and whenever an under
classman leaves early for the draft, 
the program takes a hit. I cant 
claim to be immune. Im from 
Cincinnati and a Bearcats fan; were 
Dermarr Johnson to leave school for 
the NBA after this year, I would be' 
disappointed that the team was los
ing his considerable talent after 
only one year. However, I would 
have to respect his decision as one 
that makes sense economically.
There are obvious situations 
where players have made mistakes 
in turning pro. This past year Leon 
Smith, an orphan from Chicago, 
entered the draft from high school 
and got selected by the Mavericks in 
the first round. He struggled with 
the responsibility that goes along 
with being a professional, as well as 
with the transition to the pro game. 
After being told by the Mavericks he 
wouldnt be dressing for games, he 
entered deep depression and even 
attempted suicide. A year out of 
high school, he is already at the 
stage where he is attempting a 
comeback.
An example of a situation where a 
player made the right decision in 
staying in school is Kenyon Martin. 
The Cincinnati pivot considered 
leaving after last season, when he 
would have been a mid-to-late first 
round pick. However, he decided to 
forego the draft, and has displayed 
an improved offensive game this 
season that will likely earn him 
player of the year honors as well as 
net him millions of extra dollars as a 
top three pick.
Each situation is unique, from a 
players economic background to 
his readiness to go to the next level. 
The decision of whether to turn pro 
early should rest entirely with the 
player, his family, and his coach. 
Being a fan does not give one the
right to criticize a player for his deci
sion.
We dont know all of the factors 
that played into the choice. These 
are real people with real lives, not 
mechanical parts inserted into a 
basketball machine expected to last 
for four years.
We need to get over the fact that 
our favorite team may be kept from 
a couple extra Ws and put ourselves 
in the players shoes. Would you 
hold off taking a couple million for 
the right to try to balance a big-time 
basketball schedule and classes for 
free, while the NCAA rakes in huge 
bucks? I dont think I would.

Crew team 
displays skill
The Pittsburgh Rowing 
Championships were held two 
Saturdays ago, on February 5, at 
the nearby Winchester-Thurston 
School. The championships, now 
in their eighth year, featured indi
viduals from rowing teams in the 
Pittsburgh area, including mem
bers of the Carnegie Mellon Crew 
team, competing indoor on rowing 
machines (ergometers, or ergs.)
All the ergs were connected to a 
central computer which registered 
and displayed racers times on 
monitors throughout the gymna
sium. The 2,000-meter sprints 
were separated by skill level and 
weight class.
Carnegie Mellon rowers made 
strong showings, and the highlight 
of the day came in the Lightweight 
Mens race, Event 21. Three varsi
ty men participated in this event, 
each in different flights.
The first varsity man to race was 
junior Neil Stroup. With a large 
crowd of CMU support cheering 
him on, Stroup finished first in his 
flight with a time of 7:00.7.
In the next flight, senior Jeff 
Beene was holding steady in sec
ond place for a large part of the 
race, but slowly slipped to third. 
Amidst the frenzied cheering of 
his teammates, Beene made a dra
matic comeback in the last 500 
meters and held on to finish in 
second place with a time of
 6:54.3.
In the third and final flight, 
junior Dave Clumpner started slow 
and steady, allowing nearly all of 
the other rowers in Ws flight to
pass him in the beginning. He held 
his pace, however, and as the race 
wound down the leaders began to ; 
succumb to fatigue. Clumpner cap
italized and began to pass each 
and every opponent. He finished* 
in first place with a time of 6:37.4-** 
In the end, Clumpner won the * 
overall event, Beene placed 11th,  
and Stroup placed 14th.
Other medalists included firstyear Alex Gutierrez (silver medal 
in Open Novice Men heavyweight) 1 
and first-year Brian Kambach (sil"!.

Tartan swimming finds new confidence at championships
by Brian Smith
Contributing Editor
There is an old adage in sports 
that says you play to the level of 
your competition. The Carnegie 
Mellon swimming and diving teams 
proved that once again last week as 
they went head-to-head with some 
of the toughest competition in the 
NCAA Division III at the University 
Athletic Association (UAA) 
Championships at Emory 
University. On the strength of 
unbeatable relays and perennial 
first-place breaststrokers, the team 
broke 12 school records and quali
fied swimmer? in 17 events for 
NCAA Nationals consideration.
The team had a great meet, said 
sophomore Ian Peters. Everyone 
had trained hard and we went down 
there confident. We wanted to do 
the best we could. Everyone had a 
great swim.
The mens team equaled last 
years finish, placing third in the 
, eight-team meet. The women fin' ished in a close sixth place, finishing 
behind fifth-place New York 
University by less than 30 points
(468.5-439).
We were oblivious to the score, 
said head coach David Belowich. 
We were swimming so well, it did
nt really matter. I was just delighted 
with how we were swimming on 
both the mens and womens side.... 
It was a great performance in prob
ably the deepest conference in the 
country.
Everyone went really fast, he 
said, remarking that the vast major
ity of Tartan swimmers finished 
with career-best times. Even the 
people who we dont normally look 
to as the leading points-getters on 
the team pulled off personal bests 
and scored a point for us. This meet 
was about people like that  it was 
a wonderful experience.
Going into the competition, the 
Tartans knew they had their work 
cut out for them. The Emory men 
ran away with the victory last year, 
winning all five relays and taking 
the meet by nearly 300 points.
We went in there with the idea 
that wed send [Emory] a message, 
said Peters. We knew they had a 
strong team and were probably 
going to win the conference. 
Carnegie Mellon men had. the
opportunity to send a message early 
in the 200 yard freestyle event, and 
they did. The team of senior Mike 
Robinson, sophomore Matt
Shewchuk, sophomore Sean
Belowich, and Peters took first place 
with a time of 1:24.43, setting a 
team record in the process.
Suddenly, Emory was learning a 
little humility, said coach
Belowich. What a wonderful way 
to start the meet... We were able to 
set the tone.
The momentum carried through 
to the 50 yard freestyle where 
Shewchuck grabbed another first 
place, qualified for nationals consid
eration, and set a new team record.
The first day ended with the men 
winning the 400 yard medley relay 
in dramatic fashion as the team of 
Belowich, junior Jason Striner, 
junior George Heidinger, and 
Robinson won by 0.05 seconds over 
the Emory team.
[Robinsons] anchor leg was the 
most impressive final 25 yards Ive 
ever seen, said Peters. It all came 
from the heart.
The second day built on the suc
cess of the first, and the relays once 
again took center stage in the Tartan

The Carnegie Mellon Swim teams performed well at the UAA Championships, which took place from last Thursday to Saturday 
at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. Twelve school records were broken, and many swimmers may go to nationals.
Tartans end slide, win two straight
by Nathan Steinwald
Contributing Editor
This weekend Carnegie Mellons 
mens basketball team ended the 
most painful part of any basketball 
season, the double digit losing 
streak. In back to back games in 
fact, CMU walked away victorious. 
In recent history the streak only 
rivaled that of the womens team of 
two years ago. If the men can show 
as good a turnaround as the women 
have these last two years, then 
maybe all of this seasons heartache 
will have been worth it.
On Friday the Tartans traveled to 
the Big Apple to take on UAA rival 
NYU. Perhaps the NYU Violets were 
too preoccupied with this years 
Oscar buzz, but more likely they 
were suffocated by CMUs pressure 
defense.
In the first half of the game NYU
only shot 32 percent from the floor, 
but made up for that with 6-12 
three-point shooting.
The Tartans only took 25 shots 
total in the first half, and didnt 
make very many of them. NYU 
opened up a lead and finished the 
half with a 30-17 lead.
Undaunted by the 13 point 
deficit, CMU checked its kilt-clad 
pride and entered the second half 
with more fire in their bellies. NYU 
only made four shots from the floor 
in the entire second half, and 
missed all nine of their three-point 
shots. CMU barely squeaked out the 
win at the end, with a 50-48 score.
Sophomore Dom Iodani, threepoint specialist and all around good 
guy, paced the Tartans with 18 
points and four of five shooting 
from downtown.
If Fridays win was a result of 
dominating second-half defense, 
then Sundays win over Brandeis
was a result of sustained offensive 
prowess. In the first half CMU shot 
48 percent from the floor and 42 
percent from three-point land. The 
Tartans ended the half with a 38-32 
point lead, one of the few times this 
season that the team has entered 
halftime winning.
In the second half it was the same 
story all over again. With the taste 
of victory from two nights prior, 
CMU held onto the lead and fin
ished the game with an 80-71 score. 
Once again Iodani led the team with 
20 points, but unlike the NYU game, 
he had company in double digit 
scoring territory.First year Marc 
Tata scored 18, first-year Randall 
McKinney had 17, and sophomore 
Matt Beaujon scored 10. Sophomore 
guard Jim Abel missed the illustri
ous grouping by just one point, scor
ing 9.
Thus ended the great drought of 
1999-2000.

effort. The womens 200 medley 
team had their best swim of the sea
son while the men won again, shat
tering the school record by two sec
onds and setting a new UAA mark.
The 200 medley made us three 
for three in relays, said coach 
Belowich. To say Emory learned a 
little humility by that point is an 
understatement. Our team proved 
that they could be competitive with 
anyone.
The hard-fought competition 
resulted in a _________________

meet, said sophomore Mike 
Monyok. I was more nervous but it 
was more exciting.
The atmosphere actually provid
ed the Tartans with extra motiva
tion, both in the water and out.
First day I was really nervous and 
didnt do as well, said junior Julie 
Tseng. After the morning swim, I 
got used to the intensity and began 
to feed off the energy. I used it to get 
up and help me. Its a lot of fun but 
very intimidating the first time out.
Tseng and her relay team of 
sophomores' Erin Andrew and 
Monica Costlow and senior Erin 
Rockwell set the school record and 
qualified for nationals considera
tion in the 200 yard freestyle relay. 
She also teamed with Andrew, 
Rockwell, and first-year Mei-Lan 
Ho-Walker to qualify in the 400 yard 
freestyle relay.
Aside from the relays, Carnegie 
Mellon swimmers set team records 
in seven individual events, includ
ing Rockwells 1:06.82 in the 100 
breaststroke. She finished first in 
that event as well as the 200 yard 
breaststroke, qualifying in both 
events.
She killed the competition, said 
Belowich. That was the best 100 
breast Ive ever seen her swim.
This year was special from a team 
standpoint... I had lots of fun. There was 
an excellent chemistry.
 Mens and Womens Swim 
Coach David Belowich
Sophomore Jason Striner and 
Peters both set team marks in the 
100 and 200 yard breaststroke, with 
Peters finishing ahead of Striner but 
both potentials for the nationals. 
For Peters, the events were only two 
of the seven in which he or his relay 
team qualified for nationals consid
eration.
He had the best meet of his 
career, said Belowich. You cant 
say enough about the guy. Hes been 
working really hard and its paid off. 
Hes extremely talented and I think 
it can go further, particularly in the 
relays.
This year was special from a 
team standpoint, said Belowich. I 
had lots of fun. There was an excel
lent chemistry.
With so much success going 
around, the team members are 
quick to thank the coaches.
We can pretty much attribute all 
our success to [Belowich], said 
Tseng. Hes done a great job keep
ing up with all the new ways of 
training and new styles. Hes always 
working to do things that would 
help us improve.
Dave is not the most aggressive 
coach Ive had but he had a great 
sense of being in tune with the 
team, said Peters. Hes taught me
a lot about swimming and priorities. 
We just have a great coaching staff. 
Id like to think that my experi
ence as an [NCAA Division I] coach 
really helps me at CMU, said 
Belowich. My D-III coaching expe
rience is the most gratifying experi
ence Ive had. Regardless of the divi
sion levels, I like it here. CMU 
attracts people who care about what 
they do. The people I work with are 
determined to succeed and Im real
ly proud of what they have done!

After regaining touch, womens basketball 
now readying for undefeated Washington
by Christopher Chung
Sports Editor
Last week, the womens basket
ball team extended its win streak to 
eight in a row with a 79-71 win over 
the University of Rochester, and 
hoped to extend that streak to nine 
with a victory at New York 
University last Friday.
The second matchup between the 
two teams didnt prove to be as com
petitive as their last meeting, in 
which Carnegie Mellon stole a 
54-51 win from NYU. This time, 
NYU defeated the Tartans, who shot 
a miserable 27 percent in the first 
half, with a 78-55 blowout.
After losing to NYU, now 16-5, 
the Tartans needed to refocus for 
their next challenge at Brandeis 
University yesterday.
The team started the game 
stronger this time, shooting 40 per
cent and leading Brandeis 38-31 
after the first half. In the second 
half, the Tartans were not as effi
cient, shooting only 7-25 (28 per
cent). However, going 10-13 from 
the free throw line helped them 
keep their distance from Brandeis 
(9-11), and the evening ended with 
a close 62-58 victory for the 
Tartans.
Senior Kara Coval led all players 
with 19 rebounds (10 offensive) and
16 points. In addition, junior
Lauren Petruzzi had 10 points and 
five assists, first-year Erin Brady 
provided nine points and five 
rebounds, and first-year Michelle 
Sodini notched 13 points and three 
steals.
The Tartans are now 14-8 overall, 
and face quite an unusual challenge 
at the end of this week.
This Friday, the Tartans will face 
undefeated Washington University 
(22-0) at home. Yesterday, 
Washingtons win tied the NCAA 
womens all-divisions record of 60 
straight wins, and it has a chance to 
set the record against CMU. The last 
time the two teams met, on January 
9, Washington put CMU away with a 
75-57 victory.

Fifth and Forbes construction causes controversial reaction
The Mayor is trying to develop the 
city into his vision of the city while 
not taking into consideration 
many of the fundamental problems 
that we face.
 Patty Maloney 
storeowner involved in GTCDC
According to Frank Gamrad, a 
senior research assistant with the 
Allegheny Institute for Public Policy, 
the problem with the mayors plan 
lies in this blighting process, as he 
believes that the qualifications for 
becoming blighted are far too gen
eral. Some of these qualifications 
include excessive land coverage 
and inadequate planning.
Under current definitions, any 
building can fit, he said, Im sure I 
could walk around up 
at CMU and find 
some buildings that 
could fit.
Gamrad has been 
approached by State 
Representative 
Darryl Metcalf (R) to 
write new blight 
laws. The result is a 
far more specific set 
of qualifications, and 
buildings would have 
to fail four out of 
seven of these tests in 
order to become blighted. His pro
posed law also includes the specifi
cation that sites be evaluated peri
odically, and that buildings once 
considered blighted could lose that 
status if they undergo appropriate 
renovations. Under current blight 
laws, once a building is declared 
blighted it can never lose that title.
The blight laws which Gamrad 
designed are currently under con
sideration in the Pennsylvania state 
legislature. It is being co-sponsored 
by Metcalf and State Representative 
Bill Robinson (D).
If these bills are passed, said 
Gamrad, this development will be 
over.
This would be bad news for 
Robert Rubenstein, the 
Development Project Manager at 
the Urban Redevelopment Authority 
(URA), who sees Murphys redevel
opment plan as the only way to revi
talize the downtown area.
The goal of the Forbes-Fifth plan 
is to reestablish the central business 
district and stop the decline of prop
erty values, he said.
When asked if this goal could be 
achieved by subsidizing the renova
tions of current business owners, 
instead of destroying the buildings 
and bringing in national chains, 
Rubenstein responded that for the 
past 15 years the city has offered 
low-interest loans and grants to 
local store owners but very few have 
taken the city up on its offer.
These people dont want to invest 
in their properties, said 
Rubenstein. Otherwise where have 
they been for the past 15 years?
But some store owners, like 
Maloney, claim that downtown mer
chants did not know about this 
opportunity until it was too late, 
because these programs were not 
well-publicized.
Maloney also said that even those 
buildings, such as her own store on 
439 Wood St., that did use city 
money to reface their facades are 
not being spared in the current rede
velopment plan. They too will be 
razed to make way for the new chain 
stores. Its a complete waste of tax
payer money, she said.
This fact has not been lost on 
Andrew McMullin, who is a member 
of the Taxpayer Coalition. This 
group is working to assure that, 
according to McMullin, more tax
payer money is not put into knock
ing down buildings.
McMullin says that he does not 
mind putting taxpayer money 
towards redevelopment, and says 
that the city should support those 
who want to sell their property, 
however, he objects to what he calls 
the unjustifiable seizing of peo
ples stores.
However, Rubenstein asserts that 
all store owners are being treated 
fairly and are reasonably compen
sated. He states that owners will be

The fate of downtown Pittsburgh 
has been the subject of considerable 
debate in recent months. Almost 
every resident believes that the area 
is in desperate need of revitaliza
tion. Many of the storefronts are 
deteriorating and the area is a virtu
al ghost town on weekends and after 
five oclock on weekdays. Pittsburgh 
mayor Tom Murphy 
announced a Forbes. Fifth redevelopment 
. plan in order to combat 
the abandonment of 
this once-vital down
town.
Murphys plan calls 
for the acquisition and 
razing of 62 out of 64 
buildings on Forbes 
and Fifth, east of 
Market Square, as well 
as 23 buildings within 
the Square itself. The buildings will 
be cleared to make room for upscale 
businesses like Tiffanys,FAO 
Schwartz, J.Crew, and a multi-plex 
movie theater, which Murphy hopes 
will be the centerpiece of the new 
downtown area, renamed Market 
Place at Fifth and Forbes.
But ever since his announcement 
last October, Murphy has met with 
heated protests from preservation
ists and political factions on the 
right and left. Longtime downtown 
merchants, many of whom have 
organized themselves into the 
Golden Triangle Community 
Development Corporation
(GTCDC), have become one of the 
loudest voices opposing the plan.
The mayor is trying to develop 
the city into his vision of the city 
while not taking into consideration 
many fundamental problems that 
we face, said Patty Maloney, a 
storeowner involved in the GTCDC.
The main problem, according to 
Maloney, is that no matter how 
many upscale retailers the city 
brings in, it will never overshadow 
the high corporate taxes in the area. 
Many downtown businesses have to 
pay up to 13 different taxes in order 
to stay in the city. Thus, she says, 
the corporations that Murphy is 
hoping to attract with a revitalized 
downtown, would still find it unde
sirable to develop properties here.
No corporation is going to locate 
here because there are cool places to 
shop, said Maloney. They will look 
at the bottom line and if the city 
doesnt make the tax structure cor
porate friendly there will be no 
growth.
Many storeowners got involved in 
the GTCDC not only because they 
disagree with the viability of 
Murphys plan, but also because if 
his plan goes through, their proper
ty will be seized in order to make 
room for the new stores.
All store owners are given the 
option to sell their properties to the 
city, but the mayor will use his power 
of eminent domain to take the build
ings of those who do not want to relo
cate. Eminent domain can only be 
used on buildings that have been 
deemed blighted. In order to be 
considered blighted, a store or com
pany must fail only one section of a 
seven point review process.
repaid 100 percent of their costs and 
given compensatory payments.
It is a notion that downtown 
restaurant owner Behrooz 
Rahimzadeh finds almost amusing. 
He claims that he was visited by a 
URA representative who offered 
him a total of $10,000 in relocation 
compensation.
My air conditioning alone costs 
that much, he said. Each handi
capped bathroom costs $10,000. 
Pundits from both sides noted the 
importancce of students involve
ment in the issue.
One of the reasons that we are 
doing this project is to make down
town more attractive for people to 
come and work and live in. And stu
dents are a big part of that, said 
Rubenstein.
I think the mayor is looking at 
college students and saying this 
could be the future of Pittsburgh, 
said McMullin.
Some even claim that students at 
CMU have the mayors ear more 
than any other students in the area.
CMU has a certain reputation in 
Pittsburgh, said Gamrad, If CMU 
students join an organization, it 
seems like, Oh, intelligent people are 
doing it. It gives us more credibility. 
Maloney agrees that students 
should get involved, if not with any 
particular group than just as a con
cerned member of the community.
Council needs to recognize that 
there are more fundamental prob
lems as to why young people are 
leaving the city than just shopping, 
she said.

THE TARTAN  FEBRUARY 14, 2000
Carnegie International conference features contemporary art exhibitions
by Beth Powell
Staffwriter
The Carnegie International 
99/2000 Conference on 
ontemporary Art was held this 
past Friday and Saturday in con
junction with the 1999 Carnegie 
International art exhibit that has 
bpen displayed in the Carnegie 
Museum of Art since last November. 
Itj is just one of the many programs 
the museum will offer through 
March when the exhibit, the 53rd of 
jtk kind since 1896, closes.
The conference took place in the 
rnegie Lecture Hall and brought 
together international curators, 
Writers, and artists to discuss issues 
raised by the exhibit. These people
came from all around the world, 
from New York to London to South 
Africa to Slovenia, to discuss and 
present lectures on such topics as 
the new internationalism, what 
role international art surveys play, 
and how contemporary artists deal 
with the coexistence of reality and 
fiction in contemporary life. The 
diverse group of panelists included 
Paolo Colombo, the director of the 
Center for Contemporary Art in 
Geneva, Switzerland, and Kendall 
Geers, an artist from Johannesburg, 
South Africa.
The conference topics were 
derived from the actual exhibit, 
which was put together by 
Madeleine Grynsztejn, curator of 
the Carnegie International and
Behnam Farahpour/Contributing Editor
A visitor catches a glimpse of an intricate modern art exhibit
curator of Contemporary Art at the 
Carnegie Museum of Art since 
1997. She visited more than 20 
countries, attended major exhibi
tions, researched local galleries and 
museums, and visited individual 
studios, while searching for the 
artists and works to include in the 
exhibit. A three-person committee 
advised Grynsztejn before she 
made her final decisions on what 
works to include in the exhibit. The 
committee included Okwui 
Enwezor, artistic director of 
Documenta in Kassel, Germany; 
Susanne Ghez, director of the 
Renaissance Society at the 
University of Chicago; and Lars 
Nittve, director of the Tate Gallery 
of Modern Art in London.
The committee was also the jury 
for the Carnegie International 
Prize, which was awarded to 
William Kentridge for his film, 
Stereoscope, 1999. Kentridge uses a 
very unique animation process, in 
which he starts with a charcoal 
drawing for each sequence and 
then either erases or adds lines one 
at a time, to create his films. His 
labor-intensive work comments on 
the state of post-apartheid South 
Africa. The prize comes with 
$10,000 in cash.
What is reality in todays world? 
That seems to be the theme of the 
exhibit. With works by 41 artists 
from 22 countries, including paint
ings, sculptures, film, photography, 
installations, video projections, 
works on paper, site-specific instal
lations, and mixed-media works, 
the exhibit looks at what is real 
when the coexistence of virtual and
physical, local and global, and real 
and fictive is a part of our everyday 
lives.
There are works that make use of 
the senses as well as time and the 
opportunity for interaction. A 
prime example of this is the group 
of wooden rooms, roughly shaped 
like boxes, by artist Suchan 
Kinoshita. Viewers can enter the 
rooms and see the realities of every
day life in new ways. Another pop
ular work in this category is Gabriel 
Orozos Ping Pong Table. Viewers 
are given the opportunity to interact 
with this work by developing their 
own game on the very unique pingpong table.
Then there are works that deal 
with the materialism that is so 
important in everyday life. Martin 
Kippenbergers The Happy Ending of 
Franz Kafkas Amerika, is a perfect 
example of this. The work is com
posed of a wide variety of tables and 
chairs arranged on a field. It makes 
a statement on the game of inter
viewing for a job, a process that has 
become extremely important in 
todays society.
Also included in the exhibit are 
works that make the viewer ques
tion what is actually real because 
they make slight deviations into fic
tion. Thomas Demans pieces 
include this type of work. His pho
tographs are based on real pictures 
that were taken, but are .actually 
pictures of cardboard and paper 
models. Or are they?
The Carnegie International exhib
it closes on March 26, so dont miss 
it. Be sure to check out the other 
works by Gabriel Orozco, such as
Nike Town and El Jardin del Mundo, 
and the sculptures of Sarah Sze. 
Make sure to wear shoes that are
easy to take on and off so you can 
fully explore Ernesto Neto"s 
Navedenga.

A walk into one of the many unusual art pieces at Carnegie Lecture Hall
World premier opera, The Little Prince, proudly debuts at Purnell Center
by Serena Lam
production Staff
; Shhhhhhhh. Listen, the stars are 
laughing, The Little Prince began as 
TTelly Leung, the narrator, strolled 
towards the orchestra playing the 
prologue of the opera on Friday, 
February 11, at 8 pm in the Purnell 
Center.
, On Thursday and Friday night, 
the opera was webcast to reach both 
a_domestic and international audi
ence with 170 listeners.
; The opera is based on the. novel, 
le Petit Prince, written by Antoine 
c^e Saint-Expurery and first pub
lished in French in 1943. The story 
is aboutthe little princes adventures 
on different planets and his encoun
ters withthe King, the drunkard, the 
geographer, the snake, the roses, 
ahd the fox.
; His journeys forced him to grow, 
losing innocence but gaining knowl
edge in life at the same time. Finally, 
he came to the realization of what 
he had been looking for:friendship.
Habib Azar, the composer and 
director, is a junior drama major. 
With production designer, Thomas 
Francis, and the sparkling stars, he 
transformed the book into an opera. 
Operas are not just long and boring 
and for women... said Azar. They 
can also apply to older audiences. 
He envisioned his opera as a 
break through the stereotype; he 
said he wanted it to be fun, dynamif, and enjoyable as well as satisfy
ing to all ages. This is also why he 
chose The Little Prince, which is 
widely read and internationally 
loved by readers of different ages 
and generations. It is just a beauti
ful book... I love it, Azar concluded 
with a smile as he fiddled with his 
fingers.
The finale when everyone sang 
together is Azars favorite scene 
because the texture came closest to 
what is imagined. What Azar most 
wanted to bring to the audience is a 
bitter sweet taste. Like a sweet 
tart no, no, no no, not a tart he said 
as he lifted his head and laughed at 
himself.
The musics atonal harmony, 
combined with the little princes 
constant change of facial expres
sion, created an atmosphere of hap
piness and sadness of growing up.
The masterpiece would not have 
been successful without its stars. 
Joseph Haughton, who plays the lit
tle prince, is a sophomore music 
major. According to Azar, he is the 
most able to handle a book of new 
music. With much confidence, 
Azar furhter complimented 
Haughton, who has a great ear 
which can pick up notes easily espe
cially the atonality in the score.
Haughton found it fun and easy 
to get into the character because the 
little prince is in everyone; it is a 
deep truepart of us that wants to get 
out but tends to hide.
Telly Leung, is a sophomore 
drama major. He was chosen to be 
the narrator because of his great
speaking voice which is something 
you want to hear everyday. Leung 
found The Little Prince as a fun new 
project to which he managed to con
tribute with his own touch. 
For two nights in a row, the small 
theater was a full house and over 
100 people were turned away. 
Audiences had to line up outside the 
door at least 45 minutes before the
show in order to get tickets. On 
Friday night there were only 12 tick
ets left at the door. In some cases, 
people had to wait outside the door 
until the last second before the 
show started to see if there were any 
extra tickets left.
Still, the audience enjoyed the 
show fondly and found the show 
was worth waiting for. A beautiful
job collaborating the works of dif
ferent departments, presented with 
much talent and care, said Ingrid 
Sonnichsen, a faculty member of 
the Drama department, with a 
pleasing nod.
Azars brother from Phi Kappa 
Theta, David Dybes, even described 
the opera as moving, spiritual, and 
harmonious.
The opera is amazingly successful 
and delivered with much style and 
passion, the bitter sweetness of 
growing up and wonderful childhoodmemories, like laughing stars, 
were fully portrayed through the 
incredible music and acting skills.
Perhaps someday, we might come 
upon a night under the clear sky and 
find laughing stars, like five hun
dred million little bells ringing in 
our ears, or taste a bitter sweet tart. 
Like the narrator, we might have a 
brief moment to recall our own 
innocence. This production has def
initely brought the moment to its 
audience, allowing them to leave 
the theater with youthful smiles.

Carnegie Almanac
50 YEARS AGO
February 14, 1950 - The Undergraduate 
Advisory Committee released a report finding 
chat the absence rate on the day before a vacation 
was about 10 percent, whereas the absence rate 
on a regular school day is about five percent. The 
administration had not yet made a decision on 
whether this was a serious problem that required 
{urther action.
; The absence rate before Thanksgiving vacation 
Tjvas highest in the Division of Humanistic and 
Social Studies. In Engineering and Science, the 
physics department had the highest absence rate. 
[This trend was not a problem in Margaret 
:Morrison since they did not have Saturday class. 
The highest absence rate within a particular col
lege was 15 percent.
25 YEARS AGO
February 18, 1975 - Starting with the next 
election, representation in Student Senate would 
be based on college rather than living areas. In 
the meeting when this change was approved, 
some students proposed that the old system, with 
'its representation system including the divisions 
of on Graduate, UFO, Dormitory, Independent, 
and Commuter, should be preserved.
; Students opposed to the change felt that the
college-based system would allow fraternities to 
dominate Senate by being able to control a large 
voting block. Since Senate dealt mostly with dis
tributing money for social activities, these stu
dents thought that Greek control would be harm
ful. Those in favor of the change felt that the new 
system would allow Senate to focus on academic 
issues as well as social ones. Others said that 
Senate should not deal with academic issues and 
those matters should rather be left to the Student 
Advisory Commitees.
10 YEARS AGO
February 13, 1990 - Vice President for 
Enrollment Bill Elliot announced that the search 
for a new Dean of Student Affairs would focus on 
internal candidates. Michael Murphy had been 
serving as Acting Dean of Student Affairs since 
Brad Walter resigned from the role the previous 
June.
Elliot said that the decision to conduct a search 
was not due to an inadequacy in how Murphy 
was doing the job. Rather, he said that there 
might be other candidates within the campus 
community able to do the same job to a greater 
degree. According to a census, student and fac
ulty felt content with the state of progress on 
campus and wished to see it continue.
FIVE YEARS AGO
February 13, 1995 - University Architect Paul 
Tellers announced that construction on a new 
performing arts center would begin soon. He 
said that the optimistic completion date is 1997, 
barring any construction or funding problems. 
The new building would sit between Doherty 
Hall and Warner Hall, across from the University 
Center. Other locations considered for the pro
ject were the Morewood parking lot and the area 
between Donner Hall and Margaret Morrison 
Hall. According to Tellers the Drama department 
has been promised a new building since the 
1930s.
ONE YEAR AGO
February 15, 1999 - The film crew for the 
movie The Wonder Boys would return to campus 
for a three-day period. In order to accommodate 
the filming, the CFA parking lot would be closed 
and drama and music classes would be relocated. 
In one of the scenes that would be filmed, actor 
Michael Douglass character would drive up to 
school in the CFA parking lot and have an exten
sive conversation with actor Tobey. McGuires 
character.

Windows 2K hurts MSFT
SEATTLE(AP) - Shares of Microsoft 
Corp. fell 6 percent Friday as an 
industry analyst claimed that up to 25 
percent of Windows 2000 users will 
have problems using the new soft
ware.
Michael Gartenberg, vice president 
of the Stamford, Conn.-based Gartner 
Group, said one in four companies 
will have problems getting Windows
2000 to work with existing programs 
and systems. The latest version of 
Microsofts business operating sys
tem, to replace Windows NT 4.0, is to 
debut next week.
Dell Computer CEO Michael Dell 
also made news with comments made 
Thursday during discussion of the 
companys earnings report. Dell said 
that the corporate adoption of 
Windows 2000 will likely be slow, and 
that the rival Linux operating system 
was gaining ground.
We don't see a massive immediate 
acceleration due to Windows 2000, 
said Dell in a conference call.
The combination of news sent 
Microsoft shares tumbling, down 
$6.061 to $99.933 per share on the 
Nasdaq Stock Market.
Gartenberg said he was surprised 
by the market reaction to his com
ments, since the Gartner Group had 
made similar statements in the past.
I think as the launch (of Windows 
2000) gets closer, people are obvious
ly taking a closer look at this, 
Gartenberg said. I think that may 
have something to do with the reac
tion.
Gartner Group has predicted that 
15 to 20 percent of Microsofts current 
business customers will move their 
computer systems from Windows NT 
4.0 to the new Windows 2000 system 
by the end of the year.
Gartenberg added that up to 45 
percent of Microsoft customers would 
make the move by the end of 2001.
That's not a bad migration pattern 
for any new software, he said.
Microsoft has said that it expects its 
revenues to reflect the new operating 
system starting in the third quarter of 
the year, and growing into the fourth 
quarter. Microsofts fiscal year ends 
Sept. 30.
Microsoft had no immediate 
response to Gartenbergs comments.

THE MONEY MAN
by Brad Grantz
It .is a simj>le fact that many read
ers like to turn to the last few pages 
of a book to find out the ending 
before they have even begun read
ing. Americans possess a quaint fas
cination with finishing a task as 
soon as possible. Hence, it is no sur
prise that more and more citizens 
are investing in IRAs, or individual 
retirement accounts.
Of course, in college, thinking 
about putting money away for 40 
years does not seem like such a ben
eficial idea. However, this might 
just be a great way to ensure that 
your golden years are fiscally 
strong, instead of relying on the 
generation after you to sustain 
social security.
Although once identified with 
pension plans for union workers, 
IRAs are becoming commonplace 
among younger Americans looking 
to solidify their retirement stability.
With a higher rate of return than 
savings accounts, IRAs are entering 
the minds of parents planning the 
financial well-being of their chil
dren.
An individual retirement account 
is an annuity in which one may set 
aside up to $2,000 yearly until age 
59 1/2, when one may begin to 
make withdrawals on the account. 
IRA owners make decisions on how 
their account is invested, whether 
into mutual funds, certificates of 
deposit, etc. Depositors may face 
early withdrawal fees of ten per
cent. Early withdrawal is permissiSee IRA, page L7

CMU Industrial Administration professor Sighar Tayur (left) was presented a $10,000 award last Thursday downtown at the Sheraton. Chang Oh and Yong 
Kim (right) also won phase 2 of the Enterprize Business Competition for their proposal. .
by Ish Harshawat
Eclitor-in-Chief
CMUs influence on the technol
ogy-based sector of Pittsburghs 
economy did not go unnoticed last 
Thursday. Two of the three win
ners of phase 2 of Pittsburghs 
Enterprize Business Competition 
had ties to the University.
The goal of the competition is to 
encourage business startups in and 
around Pittsburgh. Venture capi
talists, eager students, and recruit
ing executives all attended the 
award presentation.
The winners from CMU included 
GSIA students Yong Kim and 
Chang Oh, with their company 
plan for Airfreight Central, and 
CMU Industrial Administration 
professor Sighar Tayur for 
smartOps.com. Each team received 
a $10,000 cash prize.
Airfreight Central will offer busi
nesses alternatives to companies 
wanting to ship cargo in bulk, who 
usually must use FedEx or UPS. 
This will be achieved by collecting 
information on available spaces on 
commercial airlines and offering 
the lowest prices to customers. 
According to Kim, the current sys
tem used to find the lowest cost is 
time-consuming and several years 
old. Kim said he picked the trans
portation industry to focus his 
efforts because he found it to be 
the least serviced in terms of evolv
ing trends and technology.
The idea behind Tayurs 
SmartOps.com is to use special 
algorithms that he has developed 
over the last 10 years to calculate 
the exact levels of inventory that 
companies should have for their 
products. Since companies cannot 
anticipate the demand from the 
downstream, nor the supply from 
the upstream, many are frequently 
overstocked.
Before the Internet, to do this 
on a global scale was difficult, 
said Tayur. SmartOps.com will pro
vide services on-line to analyze 
data using the algorithms, and pro
vide customers with the target 
inventory levels.
The other winner was PanGo 
Networks, a project involving 
short-range wireless networking of 
mobile devices, which was submit
ted by a team of local profession
als.
Before the winners were 
announced, there was a lengthy 
panel discussion on how young 
companies should go about 
recruiting a strong business team. 
The talk branched out into other 
areas as well. Everybodys minds 
were on the recent initial public 
offering of FreeMarkets.com, and 
how Pittsburgh could now join the 
ranks of Silicon Valley, Austin, 
Texas, and Phoenix, Arizona as a 
prime site for technology-based 
startups.

Far away from the frenzy of the 
new companies of Silicon Valley, 
Astro Teller is writing startup his
tory. He and three other CMU indi
viduals  Chris Pacione, John 
Stivoric, and Chris Kasabach  
have started BodyMedia, Inc., 
which attempts to provide online 
wellness management to those 
individuals concerned with their 
physical well-being.
BodyMedia works in conjunction 
with healthcare specialists and 
potential customers to understand 
attitudes about wellness. Chief 
executive officer Teller said, If you 
are dieting, you need two things: a 
regimen... and a scale. He contin

Products from BodyMedia will 
make a fully personalized regime 
accessible to their users. The 
products will come in the form of

CMU.
In designing these products, 
BodyMedia has stepped into the 
realm of high fashion, employing 
the help of supermodels to 
model prototypes of working 
products.
These advanced technologies 
will monitor sleep, stress, nutri
tion, and blood pressure, among 
other signs of physical health. The 
devices, worn as unobtrusively 
around the house as on an evening 
out, have the capability of sending 
their compiled observations to a 
satellite, and ultimately to a data
base from which users can later 
gather feedback about their well
ness habits via a Web-based inter
face.
People will have an experience 
like checking in on email or the 
stock market, Teller said.
BodyMedia history began two 
years ago, when the foursome 
founded Sandbox Advanced 
Development, Inc., a high-tech 
consultancy firm. However, from 
day one, we knew we were going 
to do BodyMedia, stated Teller. 
Then for one year, the team 
worked hard at turning ideas into 
opportunities  essentially a 
period of fundraising for the 
greater goal.
We went through 30 iterations 
[before founding BodyMedia], all 
vaguely in the health space, 
recounted Teller.
Ironically, none of the 
BodyMedia founders have univer
sity training in business. All, how
ever, have experience in business 
as well as consulting. Teller said 
BodyMedia exists at the intersec
tion of [the founders] talents.
Many talents converge at that 
intersection. Pacione has instruct
ed courses ranging in theme from 
human-computer interaction to 
drawing. Stivoric has a degree in 
interaction design and is a sculp
tor. Kasabach co-founded the 
Design Studio at CMUs 
Engineering Design Research 
Center and had his photographic 
work displayed at an exhibition 
titled Other Ethiopias. Teller 
received his PhD in artificial intel
ligence from CMU and is a fiction 
novelist.
When asked about the multi-dis
ciplinary approach required by the 
nature of BodyMedias business, 
Teller responded, its a business

necessity [in our field]. You do that 
or you dont win.
Teller offered the advice to those 
wanting to start their own business 
that if you hate working in teams, 
you shouldnt be in a startup com
pany. He added, I learned more 
in two years by being CEO of 
Sandbox than I did in any four 
years of being in school.
Key in driving BodyMedia is 
Tellers role as chief cheer
leader. The chairman is also a 
self-described hopeless opti
mist, a trait that leads him to 
believe his ability to run a compa
ny stems more from his nature 
than his educational back
ground.
From its inception, BodyMedia 
has practiced user-centered design 
to provide product design that is
desirable as well as functional. 
User-centered design takes the 
idea of an experience and goes 
back to the medium, described 
Teller.
According to Teller, most hightech startups are spun out 
of a research center where engi
neers say wow, nobodys ever 
made an X before ... if I make an 
X, we can sell it! BodyMedia, on 
the other hand, takes a motiva
tion and says now heres 
the technology.
Unfortunately, at this time, no 
working product is available. The 
initial period of research and 
development and raising money 
is, according to Teller, essential
ly over. BodyMedia hopes to 
market their product line later 
this year.

Dear Student:
Today a close friend asked me to write to you about my battle with an eating disorder. You see, I too 
was a student at Carnegie Mellon University a few years back, and I too suffered for several years with 
what I now realize was a case of anorexia. I have come a long, long way since my days at Carnegie Mellon, 
and my only hope in writing to you is that you will know that you are not alone in this battle, and that you 
may realize that there is hope of finding a way out. I am not a medical professional and I don't have all of 
the answers, but I know what snapped me back into reality and perhaps hearing that will help you in some 
way. If it does, then it is worth sharing this story.
It all started very innocently. I was always a very thin person. In fact, the funny thing is that in high 
school I was so thin that I used to come home and cry to my mother that I wished I could gain a little 
weight so "the boys at school" would take me seriously. Then I hit a growth spurt. On top of that, when I 
went to college I no longer had the time to stay as active in sports and I gained a few pounds. Believe me, I 
was, by no definition, overweight, or fat, or even out of shape. In fact, for once I probably looked like a nor
mal mature human being. That should've made me happy, but somehow I got this notion in my head that I 
needed to get my life and my body.back under control.To do this, I started dieting and running obsessively. 
At first, I just lost a few pounds, but as I lost those pounds I wanted to lose a few more, and then a few 
more, and then a few more. I saw flaws in my body, like fat thighs, extra inches on my stomach, etc. No 
matter how skinny I got, there was always some problem that I needed to fix before I could stop the dieting 
and exercising. IMo one noticed right away until I went home for the summer. I didn't keep a running tally of 
my weight loss, but I was well under lOOIbs by the time I returned to college and I continued to try to lose 
more weight from there.
I lost my menstrual period and my hair stopped growing. I sacrificed a lot of social time with friends for 
running and studying. If it weren't for roommates and my then boyfriend you may have thought I was a 
recluse. The way I looked at it, those were sacrifices that had to be made. After all, being perfect was a 
necessity and I wasn't perfect yet  and unless I was no one would accept me for me. My body became the 
one thing that defined me. Most of my friends and most of the guys that 1 met commented on my "perfect 
body" and that only fueled my desire to lose more weight. It was like recognition for a job well done. I'm 
sure losing the first few pounds probably did make me look good, but a? I continued to drop the weight I had 
no idea that the dieting and exercising would end up taking control of me!
I was helpless, I was depressed, and I felt I had no choice and no way out. I wanted so badly to be the 
same happy go-lucky person that I was in high school, but 1 couldn't let go of the eating disorder. It had 
overpowered everything in my life. I can remember crying uncontrollably in the nutritionist's office toward 
the end of my treatment and saying that I just wish I could get "Wendy" back. I don't know what happened 
to her, she used to be so happy, she used to have so many friends. Now she is alone, and depressed all of the 
time even when she is surrounded by other people.
Then something snapped me back into reality and made me realize that nothing anyone said or did was 
going to get me out of this mess, unless I decided to do it myself. For me it was two things: 1) My nutrition
ist told me that she could no longer help me. I needed to see a therapist. 2) I saw a picture of myself in a 
bikini at my lowest weight ever.That picture scared the living daylights out of me. For once, I really saw 
myself... and it was disgusting. I looked like a walking corpse. It wasn't pretty, it wasn't attractive, I looked 
like I could barely sustain myself. From that point on I promised myself that I was going to beat this thing.
Slowly, but surely I started to gain some weight back. I still exercised a lot, but I was finally starting to 
eat again. I met a good friend that never let me get away with comments about being fat and never let me 
get away with ordering my salad with vinegar on the side/no oil without hearing about it. She and my family 
made me realize that it was okay to be human. Don't get me wrong, this battle back to reality was not easy. 
In fact it was a very long and painful process. Many many tears were shed, and it was years before I let 
myself eat red meat, cheese, chocolate, or anything with more fat in it than a chicken breast or tuna fish.
Fast forward to today. Although, I am still very focused on my health and my body (probably more so 
than the average person) I no longer suffer from the eating disorder. At times I feel insecure about my body 
and it is those times that my family reminds me of how easily I can slip back into the eating disorder. It took 
several years for me to get back to a normal body weight and sustain it, and it will probably be several more 
years before I can put my weight out of my mind all together. I wish there were some words of wisdom that 
I could give to others who are suffering with eating disorders right now, and I wish I had some secret to tell 
their friends and family that would make it all go away...but I don't. What I can tell you is that if someone 
you know is suffering from an eating disorder you can't ignore it, you can't pretend it is not happening, you 
have to at least try to help. No matter how much they fight back and no matter how much they argue that 
they don't need your help....they do! Let them know that you care about them for who they are, not what 
they weigh...and keep telling them until they get it! Hopefully, it will sink in faster with them than it did 
with me.

THE TARTAN  FEBRUARY 14, 2000
IPOs dominate market recap
MARKET MADNESS
by Thaddeus Billman
Lead by the tech and internet 
>tocks, intial public offering fever 
returned to Wall Street last week. 
WebMethods (WEBM), a business 
to business e-commerce leader, 
was the undisputed champion, 
gaining over 500 percent from its 
Dffering price. It was the fourthhighest first day gain ever and the 
highest of the new year. The gain 
came after WebMethods had 
priced at $35, well above its 
already heavily raised range of 
$28-$30. It was originally sched
uled to price in the $11-$ 13 range.
WebMethods wasnt the only big 
winner, however. Lante (LNTE), 
which helps clients such as 
Microsoft and SciQuest.com build 
their businesses on the Internet, 
gained an impressive 172 percent 
on its first day of trading. It had 
priced $1 above its already raised 
range of $17-$ 19. It was originally 
scheduled to price at $10-$ 12. Via 
Net.Works (VNWI), an internet ser
vice provider with business in 
Europe and Latin America, more 
than doubled. Organic (OGNC), a 
Web design firm hailed as one of 
the original net companies, fell 
1/16 short of doubling at $39 
15/16. It had been as high as $60 
earlier in the day. Buy.com (BUYX) 
gained an impressive 92 percent on 
its opening day of trade.
Not all IPOs were a booming 
success, however, as Pets.com 
(IPET) finished its opening day 
back where it priced at $11. It 
had traded as high as $14 during 
the day. Beasley Broadcasting 
(BBGI), which owns and oper
ates stations in the east, closed 
more than $1 below its offering 
price of $15.50.
Money continued to flow out of 
the big name techs into smaller, 
more speculative companies. 
Yahoo (YHOO) lost three percent 
to finish at $342 11/16. The web 
site is down more than 30 percent
from its all-time high of $500 1/8 
set on January 4. Online auction 
giant eBay (EBAY) lost nearly 9%, 
finishing at $153 3/8.
Amazon.com (AMZN) dropped 
three percent, and Compaq 
(CPQ) slipped six percent. 
Meanwhile, speculative spikes 
were rampant.
Energy BioSystems (ENBC) 
nearly tripled on Monday on news 
of a gene shuffling experiment. 
Speculation remained high, as 
Energy nearly doubled again on 
Thursday, hitting a high of $23 
1/8, some 514 percent above last 
weeks close of $4. Reality 
returned Friday, as the stock cor
rected itself to finish the week at 
$16 15/16.
On Thursday, China Prosperity 
(CPIH), a nearly-bankrupt con
struction company, soared as 
much as 161 percent on a rerelease of old news. The run was 
due, in part, to a heavily shorted 
float. The stock had previously 
run from $1 to $80 in two days in 
November during China'-mania. 
Many investors had been holding 
the stock short since then, citing 
fundamentals that showed the 
stock was worthless. Not all 
short-sellers were killed by 
Thursdays run, however, as many 
rejoiced at the opportunity to 
short more at a higher price. 
China Prosperity finished Friday 
at $17 3/8, down 11 percent from 
Thursdays close and 33 percent 
from Thursdays high.
These were far from the only 
stocks subject to pig action, how
ever. (On Wall Street, a pig is 
someone who buys a stock solely 
because he sees that it is up sub
stantially.) Margo Caribe (MRGO) 
more than tripled on news of a 
reverse merger. Boston Biomed 
(BBII) gained 130 percent on 
news of FDA approval for a new 
HIV test.
Professor, students take 
home Enterprize award
Matt Brun/Special Projects Manager
Other CMU students also attended Enterprize awards last Thursday. IDS and 
business major Shamit Mehta (left) and Business major Alireza Ardalan 
(right) entered the competiion with their company, Only Connect, which was 
in the top twenty percent of the entrants.

Randy Frasinelli, Managing local Enterprize Competition, he
Principal of Grant-Williams 
Associates, a recruting firm. Later, 
when speaking about corporate cul
ture Frasinelli said, [Silicon Valley] 
is almost disgusting. The first thing 
they ask is how many options do I 
get? The panelists saw Pittsburgh 
has an attractive environment for 
start-ups seeking an accesible city.
Although many would like to see 
Pittsburgh attract startups, the 
case may be that investors are not 
putting their money where their 
mouths are.
Ive had better luck outside the 
city. Ive gotten further in places like 
New York  which is very surpris
ing, said Airfreights Kim, who said 
he had higher expectations from 
venture capitalists in association 
with the Enterprize Competition. 
Kim said very few Pittsburgh 
investors had approached him. 
They havent given me the time of 
day at this point. Kim added that 
he hopes the city's business sector 
catches up before the Internet wave 
passes it by.

Student Senate uses inflation 
rate to determine fee increase
by Brad Grantz
Volumell 94u,Is
On February 3, 2000, Student 
Senate voted to increase the student 
activities fee by three dollars per 
semester. Starting in the fall of 
2Q00, students will pay a $68 
amount instead of the previous fig
ure of $65. The three dollar 
increase was implemented to adjust 
for the inflation over the past two 
years, according to Dean of Student 
Affairs Michael Murphy.
While the decision was based on 
the changes in the consumer price 
index, the adjustment was made in 
comparision to inflation in the 
Pittsburgh metropolitan area.
The consumer price index, or 
CPI, is a figure which measures 
national inflation in a wide range 
of consumer goods. For example, 
the CPI accounts for price changes 
in foodstuffs, housing, apparel, 
transportation, medical care, 
recreation, and education and 
communication, as well as other 
goods and services such as tobacco 
products and haircuts.
The education and communica
tion segment of the CPI includes 
price changes in college tuition, 
postage, telephone services, com
puter software, and accessories.
CPI figures represent the buying
habits and trends of individuals who 
are purchasing goods in an urban 
environment and urban wage earn
ers and clerical workers. 
Approximately 87 percent of the 
American population is accounted 
for by the Bureau of Labor Services,
said. I would not say its talk 
theyre putting in a lot of time.
Airfreight Central should have a 
working prototype by February, 
according to Kim, who said he is 99 
percent sure that this is where his 
interests lie in terms of a career. 
Ill put it this way. Ive turned 
down two job offers now, he said.
The technology used in 
SmartOps.com has already been 
tested by three or four large com
panies,. said Tayur. When released, 
the algorithmic analysis will be 
available on-line. In addition, there 
might be the possibility of expand
ing it to Windows-based platforms 
and private intranets.
Invest in an IRA to secure 
your financial future
IRA, from page L4
ble under certain situations such as
divorce decree or disability status.
What makes an IRA appealing is 
its highly successful rate of return. 
Historically speaking, the IRAs 
have a rate of return of approxi
mately ten to 12 percent yearly. 
Hence, an account usually doubles 
in value every seven and one half 
years (for a ten percent return 
rate). For example, if at age 20 
you made a one-time deposit of 
$2,000 into an IRA, with a return 
rate of ten percent, your account 
would equal $192, 462.23 in 45 
years.
However, a person must make 
safe intelligent choices about the 
manner in which the money is 
invested. In a majority of situa
tions, a financial consultant will 
suggest high-performance mutual 
funds. A proven mutual fund is 
highly reliable and very advanta
geous to your future pocketbook. 
Investors may decide to place their 
savings into certificates of deposits 
(CDs). CDs provide a financial 
institution with an amount to lend 
to prospective clients. The CD pur
chaser will receive that amount 
plus interest, in a specific number 
of months or years. The interst rate 
currently values between five and 
six percent.
The obvious benefit of an IRA is 
its tax-exempt status. Interest 
earned on IRAs is tax-deferred, 
meaning it is not subject to federal 
income taxes. Deposits made into 
an IRA account can be deducted
from earned income, meaning 
lower yearly income taxes. For 
example, if you earned $50,000 in 
1999, but put $2,000 into your IRA, 
you could report your yearly income 
as $48,000. Deposits cannot exceed 
ones yearly income or $2,000 total 
each year. However, once the annu
ity is withdrawn, the income is tax
able.
Additionally, the tax-deferred sta
tus of IRA deposits could negate 
your entire federal income taxes. 
For example, if you earned $2,499 
this past year, and decided to open 
an IRA, you could deposit $500 and 
avoid paying federal income taxes 
altogether.
A different type of IRA, the Roth 
IRA, does not allow deposits to be 
deducted from your yearly income. 
However, your annuity payments 
after you begin to withdrawn from 
your IRA are tax-deferred. Hence, if 
you expect to enter a higher tax 
bracket later in life and make 
$2,000 deposits into your IRA, it 
may be more beneficial to create a 
Roth IRA.The bottom line is, the earlier you 
start setting aside income for an 
IRA, the more money you will have 
when you retire and begin to with
draw from it.
The advice expressed here should 
not be construed as a guarantee for 
future financial success. One should 
always consult an investment planner 
when making personal economic 
decisions.

Weekly Horoscopes
Momo Starbuck
For all you lovers out there, the 
stars are sittin pretty! Its February 
14, that time of year again when even 
the Amish get busy! So, bust out the 
corsets and the hoop skirts and show 
some ankle!
Aquarius
(January 20 - February 18)
Has your online lover gotten your 
panties in a bundle? Well, Quarie, 
Momos got some bad news for you. 
What you thought was a buxom 
blonde with a keen sense of style is 
really your Uncle Mort spending his 
spare time living out his transsexu
al fantasies on the Internet. So 
sorry to disappoint you. I suggest 
drinking copious amounts of hard 
liquor, and watching Party of Five 
reruns  anything to get Uncle 
Mort and his corns out of your head 
this Valentines Day. If that doesnt 
work, try shaving your head and 
joining a Buddhist monastery. One 
or the other....
Pisces
(February 19 - March 20)
Have you noticed lately that 
there just arent enough fish in the 
sea? Well, fishy face, it is time to 
start bringing those standards 
down\ Who needs a well-paying job, 
strapping good looks, and a keen 
sense of tact, when you can go just 
down to any street corner and find 
yourself, a pulse and a full head of 
hair anytime you want! Tis 'the sea1, 
son to be breeding! Dont let Momo 
down, fishy, shes counting on you 
to spawn, so'youd better get your 
fins in gear and start swimming 
upstream!
Aries
(March 21 - April 19)
Let me tell you a story about one 
of my more recent encounters with 
your kind. It was a romantic 
evening: the candles were lit, he 
was staring longingly into Momos 
lustful eyes, his hands brushing 
ever so softly against my supple, 
recently lipo-sucked thighs, Barry 
Manilow filling the air with his 
smooth vibrations. Then what
could have been the most erotic 
experience of my life was utterly 
ruined by your whiny voice telling 
your honey-pie all about your 
recent visit to the proctologist! Let 
me tell you, nothing quite sets the 
mood like a graphic depiction of 
anal cysts. So, for all you loud
mouthed rams out there, either 
learn to keep your voice down in 
public, or start learning how to 
wipe your posterior properly.
Taurus
(April 20 - May 20)
Alright kids, now is the time to 
grab your fellow bull by the horns\ 
You know what Im talking about. 
That shy, demure, goody-two-shoes 
attitude is not going to get you any
where this Valentines Day. My sug
gestion? Ive always thought a nice 
romantic hike in the mountains 
would, get anyone in the mood to 
get it on. But if that doesnt work, I 
suggest running with the bulls  
its always worked for Momo. Those 
Spanish matadors are the finest 
pieces of ass Ive ever seen! Ole!
Gemini
(May 21 -June,21)
Listen, I know its been a dry

mom selected from the hopeless 
singles personal listings in Better 
Homes and Gardens. Theres always 
an opportunity to find the copilot of 
your dreams. But might I suggest 
that even though you Gemini are 
twins and are never truly alone, do 
not, I repeat, do not resort to your 
brethren in times of desperation. 
For Gods sake, Gem, there are 
laws.
Cancer
(June 22 - July 22)
The black clothes and veil are 
completely unnecessary this 
Valentines Day, cans. I know you 
would rather scrub down your toi
let with your toothbrush and then 
proceed to give your teeth a good 
dose of baking soda .and peroxide 
than look at another heart-shaped 
box of chocolates with those little 
red ribbons and the mushy poetry. 
But you know what, you need to get 
over it and quit your bitching. As 
Ive always said, never pass up an 
opportunity for reckless nookie. If 
youre attached, quit moping about 
having to miss the 90210 reruns 
youve seen repeatedly (you know 
its going to be on FX 24 hours a
day) and give your partner what 
hes been missing for the past 18 
months. If youre single, now is not 
the time to develop a strong sense 
of morality. Momo decrees, go forth 
my children, and multiply!
Leo
(July 23 - August 22)
Leo, Leo, Leo. Ive seen what 
youve been bringing home every 
night, and thats what I call  spe
cial kind ofskank. (Britney Spears 
has nothing on that last girl!) Come 
on, Leo, you know you can do better 
than that. Youre the king of the 
jungle, for Gods sake. You can do 
better than some flesh-eating 
piranha. So, what I want you to do 
is work on that fly and get yourself 
a quality catch. Roarrrrrrr....
Virgo
(August 23 - September 22)
Oh Virgo, my heart goes out to 
you precious puritans. You may 
think that the stars have forsaken 
you, and damned you to an eternity 
of chastity. But such is not the case! 
Momo is a Virgo, you know. And do 
you think that Ive made it through 
as many decades as I have without 
some satisfaction? Hell no! I was 
only a wee nipper when I discov
ered the wonders: of modem vibra
tional technology. There are always 
ways around the stars, honey! Do 
you think I was going to let huge 
balls of gas billions of light years 
away determine my happiness? Did 
you think I was going to let myself 
get shafted in the realm of love? 
Was I to live without ever sucking 
the juices from this precious fruit 
called life? Bitch, please. Ive had 
enough of your hypocritical purity.
I saw you making kissy faces with 
that boy, you tease. Thats just not 
right. ,
Libra
(September 23 - October 23)
Okay, Leebs. Momos been get
ting some serious vibes about you, 
and I think its time she shared her 
intuitions. The following things wijl 
not be happening to you this 
Valentines Day:
1. Pamela Anderson will not be 
showing up ^t your doorstep 
wrapped in that red ribbon you saw 
on display at Kards Unlimited.
2. That sexy guy at Barnes and 
Noble? Not going to happen.
3. That sexy waitress at Eat n 
Park? Not going to happen.
4. Monica Lewinsky? Thankfully, 
not going to happen.
5. Enrique Iglesias? En tus 
sueos!
6. A dozen red roses on the 14th?
Not going to happen.
7. An overnight increase in your 
cup size? Not going to happen.
8. A sale at Victorias Secret? Not 
going to happen.
9. A one night stand with your 
sexy history professor? Definitely 
not going to happen.
10. The chances of you getting 
laid on Valentines Day? Slim to 
none. Sorry to be the bearer of bad 
news, but dont kill the messenger.
Scorpio
(October 24 - November 21)
Hey stinger, this is definately 
your month! Its time to release all 
that pent-up venom on one lucky 
winner! You need to shre some of 
those good vibrations with Momo. 
Shes been feeling a little bit dry 
lately, and she needs some help 
from a slick talker like you. I have 
no other advice for you but this: 
whatever (or whoever) you do, 
always remember to spread the 
wealth!
Sagittarius
(November 22 - Decmber 21)
CUpid is all out of arrows, so 
Momos counting on you to nail 
everyone with your spears of love 
for Valentines Day 2000. Afraid 
youve lost your aim? Do not worry 
my little Saggy, its all in the wrist. 
You need th mental toughness and 
determination of a.gold-medal ath
lete. Simply think of Mark Spitz, the 
famous swimmer, and stroke! 
Stroke!
Capricorn
(December 22 - January 19)
Alright you mountain goat, time 
to stop grazing the pastures and 
Start climbing! Theres no way 
youll make it all the way up if you 
dont set your sights high. Love is all 
about starting out slowly, at a nice, 
comfortable pace. As your goal 
comes into view, dont give in to the 
compulsion to ; go faster and faster 
to achieve the prize. Love is all 
about appreciation, about explo
ration, and most of all, about 
patience. Dont go searching too 
deep for the love of your life, Cappy. 
There may come a time when you 
are so worked up over love that you 
feel youre on the verge of explod
ing, but I assure you, all you have to 
do is relax. No need to sharpen your 
horns, because love is not about 
constantly butting heads. Love is a 
precious, precious thing. So, now 
that Ive given you some food for 
thought, go snuggle up to your 
loved one with a nice steaming cup 
of hot cocoa. (And dont forget the 
goats milk!)
New Music
Female artist off to good start
by Beth Powell
1omuIs 6,taarsu,es
Brief Strop, the first effort by up-and-coming artist Sheila Nicholls, 
puts a new twist on the idea of feminist musicians that was born in the 
1990s. Think of her as Alanis Morisette meets Sarah McLachlan. 
However, the original lyrics and interesting details of the instrumental 
music are what set Nicholls apart from her contemporaries.
Nicholls wrote almost all of the lyrics for this album herself. They are 
extremely explicit and vivid, painting pictures of and telling real-life 
stories.
Moreover, her lyrics serve as comments on a wide range of subjects, 
from friendship to war and from love to rape. A couple songs even add 
new feminist interpretations to some standard fairy tales, as in 
Rapunzel and Pan. The beautiful but simple poetry of the lyrics 
only adds to their quality.
While the lyrics are beautiful in themselves, adding original music to 
their delivery only adds to the overall charm of Brief Strop. Nicholls 
certainly proves that she is a talented piano player. With instruments 
such as the hammer dulcimer, harmonium, and vibes, the percussion 
breaks are very fun, unusual, and unique. Be sure to pay attention to 
the one in Peanuts. The play between the piano and guitar is also 
amazing at times. The two instruments seem to blend into one, and 
youre left wondering if both are still playing or if one has just taken 
over. Nicholls clearly knows about the intricacies of the instruments 
she uses in her band. And shes a good vocalist too, although her voice 
is a little rough at times. The beautiful back-up music helps make the 
roughness more of an endearing quality than a reason to stop listening.
Most of the songs stay in the slow to medium pace range, but a cou
ple upbeat ones break them up here and there. The best example of the 
faster songs is Eiderdown. I wish there were a couple more like this 
track. It was one that you just have to tap your foot along with. The lack 
of variety in tempo is probably the biggest problem this album has.
Nicholls takes a stand on many issues in this album and I think it will 
be interesting to see what she addresses in her next one. In Brief Strop 
she has proven that she has the potential to be the next big feminist 
musician of our generation. She is a talented vocalist, pianist, and 
songwriter. In this, her debut album, she has shown her originality and 
ability. The only things lacking are a little experience and a some added 
variety. Sheila Nicholls is definitely a good artist to check out, espe
cially if youre into the feminist types.
Cheap Movies
(for cheap students)
movies you may have seen before
BY ANDY FRANCIS
8 1/2
Thursday, February 17
8 1/2 things you should know about this movie:
1) Directed by and based on the life of acclaimed director 
Federico Fellini.
2) Not a word of English in it.
3) Numbers one and two are pretty much all I know about 
this movie at this point, and I still have 5 1/2 more things to
go43 Skip to number 8 1/2 if you actually want to read somer 
thing interesting about this movie.
5) Won two of the five Oscars it was nominated for in 1964, 
including Best Foreign Language Film.
6) Lost the other three in overtime.
7) It would have been a lot easier to write about Seven.
8) Number eight is usually funny on Lettermans Top Teh 
lists. Way better than #1, anyway.
8 1/2) You skipped right to this one, didnt you? Man, 
youre lazy. Now Im glad I didnt think of anything to write 
for it.

Dogma
Friday, February 18
I love stupid people. People will go on and on about how 
annoying dumb people can be, leaving their blinkers on for 
miles and miles on the highway, and allowing Britney Spears 
to become popular. But for sheer humor value, litde if any
thing tops stupid people who are really, really passionate 
about things they dont know anything about.
Take, for example, the people who protested this movie 
without even seeing it. These people were really, really mad-j 
despite the fact that Dogma is about as threatening and seri
ous as the Smurfs. Director Kevin Smith even joined some 
protesters outside an early screening  a bold move, consid
ering the number of death threats he received. Death threats? 
A real credit to their faith, those folks.
I read somewhere that this movie has pretty bad cine1 
matography. What on earth is that? I think cinematography 
is one of those things that people talk about but you never 
really see any evidence of, like germs or women who can be 
reasonable.

The Insider
Saturday, February 19
Remember the part in Devils Advocate where A1 Pacino 
turns down the volume on his performance as Satan and por
trays the dark lord as a sensitive, emotional being? Of course 
you dont. With Keanu Reeves on the screen, Pacino was con
tractually obligated to overact each scene like it was his last. 
Fortunately, The Insider backs Pacino up with a plot (tobacco 
executive spills his story to 60 Minutes'), not to mention other 
actors (Russell Crowe, Philip Baker Hall) and other movie 
stuff (sound, pictures, guns).
Other than American Beauty, this film is probably getting 
the most Oscar hype, with the first Academy Awards of the 
millennium only about a month away. Yuck, I cant believe I 
just said millennium  I mean, its February already. Still, 
at least Im not one of those people who claims the milleinnium starts in 2001. Does anyone think those people are more 
intelligent for pointing out a trivial error in an already some
what arbitrary date? 2000 is a big, round number, and if you 
want to celebrate the millennium 10 months from now, dont 
come to my party.

Make Them Die Slowly
Sunday, Februaiy 20
Sure, its been banned in 31 countries (this is basically the 
films only selling point), but here on planet CMU its back for 
its second appearance in the three years Ive impersonated a 
student here. Renowned for its ultra-violence (1,235,970 1/2 
people are killed during the movie), the film formerly known 
as Cannibal ferox is certainly not for the faint of heart.
Im genuinely curious as to what it was like to be a part of 
this movie. Did they shoot any scenes more than once? Why? 
Did any cast or crew member think, Wow, people have been 
making movies for 80 years now and this is all the better we 
can do? Probably not, since most of them were Italian and 
didnt think in English. Was anything too gory for this movie?
Dont forget your barf bag for this one, and try to keep your 
distance from me.

In order for this to be true, 
Manwich must be smarter than 
sandwich. I will now prove 
the superiority of Manwich's 
intelligence over that of sandwich.
But I'll be damned if you ever 
manage to make me eat that

Because Manwich is composed of 
small particles, it may perform 
unary addition, unlike sandwich.

Pop Goes the Issue
Another ball drops in Times Square, a new era of 
Dossier begins. Split like an embryo, the literary editor 
position has given birth to two cohorts for the 2000 
season. Design has once again spawned a brilliant 
explosion of creativity. So we begin.
Mom always said three heads are better than one, so 
using spider graphs, outlines, pizza and back issues of 
Playboy (circa 1972-1979), we decided to call the first 
issue Pop. Pop culture, surprise, hitting, music, or, if 
youre from Pittsburgh, the proper terminology for 
soda. The list is endless; the associations made bring 
up a variety of concepts, ideas, and stories.
The new millennium marks a new, clearer vision for 
Dossier in its visual purpose. The magazine will no 
longer conform to design formats or styles. While the 
size and printing process will remain unchanged from 
issue to issue, no logos, grids or typographic standards 
will guide the visual communication. Characteristically, 
Dossier has used expressive design to explicitly and 
implicitly give form and add meaning to its semantic 
content.
This new departure from grid formats and a consistent 
style places a new emphasis on the visual material in the 
mag'azine. Dossier is about content and form, an equal 
interdependent relationship. In the past, that relationship 
may have been unclear, undefined, or even lopsided. The 
dynamics of the relationship between form and content 
will not be addressed in a verbal, theoretical way, but 
actively exercised in the production of the pieces. We 
hope that Dossier will inspire critical thought on both 
the subjects explicitly presented in the literature and the 
modes of visual representation employed.
Like our open-ended title, the new Dossier will be a 
collaboration between powerful words and intense 
images. In a way, its like sex.
Until next time...be inspired.
Joey, Mike, and Laura

PITTSBURGH, 4 TIMES, REAL, REAL SHORT 
I Hang Out In Airport Lounges
by Anne Ray
Tuesday
10 p.m.
The Pittsburgh airport has a rib joint on Concourse A, right next 
to gate 43an airport lounge, only without the guys singing 
Tom Jones in powder-blue tuxes. Neon lights, red plastic chairs, 
a view of approaching 747's, and cranky travelers. People sit in 
here, indulging in smoke and drink and food. I sit in here some
times, pretending I have a destination, when I want to do a little 
controlled drifting. I rode the bus here, by myself, came inside 
and wandered around for a while, sat in a chair, rode the escala
tors slowly.
Inside the rib joint, the room is crowded, people resigned 
to waiting, most of them sitting by themselves, reading, eating 
bar food. Two televisions hang from the ceiling, a soundless 
hockey game glowing over the dim bar. A man in a maroon 
turtleneck sits next to me, smoking some fancy cigarettes. 
Maybe they're Canadian. Then he says, "What, no drink for you?'
I tell him I'm just drinking soda. He smiles and says, Til 
have one for you then." I tell him I'm waiting, and he tells me 
he's from Canada.
I've about had my fill of this airport, though. I've managed 
to miss the bus I meant to catch back homenow Ive got an 
hour and a half to wait. It's good to sit down. I'm hungry and 
cranky now, and I feel like my clothes and my shoes are starting 
to sink into the floor. I get the sense that everybody else feels a 
bit rumpled too.
A waitressthin, rosy-cheeked, wearing black sneakers 
and suspenderscomes over to this end of the bar, brings me 
another soda. Her nametag says "Kim, Clinton, PA." She looks at 
the hockey game. The Redwings just tied it up with the Pens.
She says, "I always catch the losing shots.1 It comes like 
shawtz.
Have I forgotten I'm in Pittsburgh? I sit and think how my 
fetish for airports is strange, how 1 like this waiting, these 
places where all you do is wait and commiserate. This place is 
transienteverything impermanent, a temporary situation. You 
aren't supposed to wait in an airport, it's meant for coming, 
going, not staying.
But the city creeps inin a word pronounced, a hockey 
game. And an hour later I get back on the bus, ride a route 
where I know all the stops. I feel like I've come and gone. Maybe 
the waiting was enough? Do I really want to go anywhere?

OrpnSmoothie
I by Joe Valeri
This "cafe" serves barbecue wings, 
calls out your order over a loudspeaker, . 
and you can't even smoke here.
I'm afraid my notebook and pen
may dry up under the fluorescent 
lights and pristine walls.
I sit and cringe at the mainstream 
alterna-rock radio station:
I used to be a little boy
bullshit-angst dripping off his tongue, 
probably pierced in that glamour/rebellion 
combo, fifty-five dollar retro shirt hanging 
from thin white limbs. You used to be
a little boy, but now you're a rock star.
I wipe leftover grease and hard 
french fries off the plastic-coated 
institutional wooden table, spread
out my notebook and scraps of paper.
A guy with a n/ce haircut at a table near me 
mouths the words around the straw 
through which he sucks, his Oreo Smoothie,
his silly beverage that isn't a symbol 
for anything really.
A killer in me is a killer in youWhat's a boy supposed to do?
I don't wash for dinner anymoresometimes just a joint and a Tylenol PM 
for dessert. The Oreo Smoothie guy, 
khaki pants not quite reaching
his brown leather wingtips, pecks 
away at his laptop keyboard, still mumbling 
the lyrics, safely .wrapped in his flannel 
shirt, while the loudspeaker calls out
his portabella mushroom sandwich.
He rises, tips his Smoothie, soaking 
his e-investments, and the ink 
drains from my pen and fills the page.

* Fat Tuesday Erin Tocknell
Four of us crowd around the kitchen sink 
to mix White Russians in giant cups 
whose dish-water faded greens and golds 
herald Mardi Gras '98, '94, '91, etc.
Later we'll press into the street 
battle mobs for more cups 
for airborne plastic beads 
and technicolor coins that clink 
aluminum onto the sidewalk.
And we know that it's really not 
the trinkets, but the pursuit 
lifting our eyes to the floats 
painted with circus hues 
yelling, stretching, for the sparkles 
of plastic and string that fly 
drunkenly down from winter sunlight.
The trumpets and tubas and bass drums 
press in closer than beer-soaked crowds. 
Marching bands don capes, dance in the streets.
The faded cups, the White Russians 
are pre-cursors and we down them 
not-too-quickly, the Kahlua's home-made, 
tastes like nectar should.
We toss the cups so they clatter 
into the sink and then we charge 
out the door, half-running 
because enjoyment's mostly a matter 
of how much you can find.

---------------------------------------------------

Shimokatazawa. the letters on the arch over the shopping arcade spell out. 
done up in black-orange-white, very heavy metal horror movie. This is where 
to find nightmarish horror model kits. Pushead t-shirts and posters and 
records. The used shops. American clothing and skate sneakers. Toy shops 
directed towards collectors, filled with Planet of the Apes and Lupin dolls. 
McDonalds Happy Meal toys, and Nightmare Before Christmas eveiything. 
crazy stuff that we can't find in the USA. A trueyouth mecca. stylish kids 
strolling around. The moment Andrew and I step off the train and into the 
street, no one over thirty is in sight. Flyers for punk and hip-hop shows at 
local clubs and performance spaces tacked onto electric poles, evidence of a 
thriving underground tucked into the edges of Tokyo. Spiky hair and tight 
dark clothing, super-fast loud music. Like our favorite Japanese band. Melt 
Banana. Japanese rockers exhibit tiny stature but earwax-nielting noise.
We find the most intricate junk shop ever, piles ofyouth ephemera 
to sift through, animal print spiky punk bracelets that I covet, Beverly Hills, 
90210 gear, wobbly hula girls and postal workers, manga, videos, wind-up 
monkeys that do a flip, inflatable furniture. Pez dispensers from France, all 
jumbled, stacked in precarious piles and way overpriced. Such is the nature 
of Tokyo. We laugh at our good luck at finding this place, browse for hours, 
buy nothing. Andrew finally finds the hip-hop store he was searching for. and 
contentedjy riffles through the 12-inches until they close. We pass video 
game arcades blasting J-pop or loud rock, duck into photo-sticker machines 
already plastered with images of past customers. Fluorescent lighting pours 
out of a crowded Mosburger fast food restaurant. We wander along the wind
ing back streets, darting in whatever looks most interesting, and soon we are 
lost in an overpowering collage of flashing lights and loud music and con
sumerism and throngs of kids in expensive sneakers.
Shimokatazawa, Tokyo 1999
Mary Tremonte
We take a train and two subways to get back to the Ikebukuro. the neighbor
hood of our lyokan. the Japanese-style hotel where we have chosen to base 
ourselves. The neighborhood is full of love hotels, rates by the hour or. after
II pm, overnight. Many of the Shibuya love hotels have themes. Arabian 
Nights or King Arthur's Castle or Tarzan's Treehouse. but in Ikebukuro they 
are more subdued. Other forms of illicit entertainment are not. as a late 
night stroll confirms. We could have any of our choice of strip clubs, soap 
parlors, or call giVls, though as foreigners they are probably not really ours 
for the asking. We pass Pachinko parlors stufTed with overweight middleaged men in open-collared shirts, an automatic Atom Boy Sushi restaurant 
with plates flying around a conveyor belt in front of customers. When we are 
hungry we stop at a convenience store for food. We are terrified of tiying to 
order in Japanese.
We are relieved to finally return to the warmth and comfort of our 
lyokan. We take hot showers and tease each other about wearing the robes 
provided for our lounging about. The place is packed with gaijin, Englishspeaking for the most part; obnoxiously discussing sci-fi and bogarting the 
television, or blase Lonely Planet-totin' backpackers, all breezy aloofness. I'm 
thankful for the peace of our room, happy to be nestled under the covers 
with his body spooned behind me. two people on one futon, isolated togeth
er in the largest city in the world.

She hardly makes enough money to pay her rent and thats why the two of you go to 
ladies night.
You lick the back of your hand and shake salt onto it. A couple of guys 
sitting next to you offer to lick your friends hand for her. She doesn't hear them 
and picks up a lemon. Examine her eyes after she takes the shot.
If her eyes look ripe and her make-up is in place, then return to the 
dance floor. There will be two good hours of fun left in her if she doesnt have 
another drink. If her eyes are glassy and sad, avoid dangerous topics such as the 
future, her family, job skills, income, car payments and Neitzsche. He was the last 
philosopher she studied in the Intro to Philosophy she failed at the community col
lege last fall. You dont mind skirting philosophy because it bores you with its 
intangibility and pointlessness. The one safe topic is men. Neither of you have 
anything invested in them. You dont know that many anymore, and she doesnt 
care about any of the ones, she knows.
"Have you talked to James lately?" she asks. James was a guy you dated 
two years ago and haven't talked to since. She's being kind by inquiring about 
him.
No, thank God," you say, and both of you nod. He has a fatal flaw," you 
say. But you never know what that flaw was. Your friend never asks. You sit in 
silence for a moment and then your friend brings up one of the taboo subjects.
"I wish I knew what I was going to do with my life," she says. You start 
looking for a guy to dance with her at this point. But sjnce its almost one in the 
morning, your friend is completely smashed. She has overstepped the boundary 
between tipsy and sloppy. You might have to carry her to the car and you wished 
you had worn boots. Wardrobe problems are another hazard of going out with your 
hot friend. Shes six inches taller than her, so you have to wear heels. Plus, you 
have to wear something low cut if your going to have any chance of competing with 
her long legs. However, these outfits arent practical for the end of the night activi
ties.
If she starts crying at the bar, pray that you can get her out before the 
bouncers see her. Even though she knows the bouncers, they wont hesitate to 
escort the two of you out of the building. The same obese bouncer whose lap she 
sat on at the beginning of the night and gave a little kiss to on the mouth will make 
her leave whether she has to be sick or not. Hell pat her on the ass and send you 
on your way. You have always hated this guy and tell him so as the door to the club 
slams close.
Once a breeze of cold air blows up your skirt outside the bar, you regret 
drinking as much as you did. You grip your friend around the waist and begin the 
journey to the car. Like walking a puppy for the first time, there are many detours 
and distractions. She has to pee behind a dumpster, and throw up next to a tree. 
She needs to gather her thoughts at a bus stop bench and smoke a cigarette on the 
bridge over the Platte River. She accidentally burns your hand with the cigarette 
when you are helping her up from the sidewalk. You yell at her.
Why do we have to do this every time?" you say. The level of the river is 
high that night. It has risen above the cement barriers and spills over onto the 
grass.
I shouldnt have had that last shot," she says, as if that last shot was the 
whole problem. As if the two of you haven't been in this situation a thousand 
times before. Sitting on the same bridge regretting what has happened.
She holds onto the bridge railing and stands up. She still looks hot 
despite the vomit on her clothes. The two of you walk back to the car holding 
hands. You decide never to go out with her again, even though you know you will.

Going to Ladies Night with a hot friend is the worst thing you can do as a 
merely cute girl. You both come to these clubs with a vague hope of finding a nice guy, 
but thats almost impossible to do when you are hanging out with a hot girl. Men will 
fawn over your friend, tell her that shes beautiful, buy her vodka tonics with a martyr 
look on their face, even though drinks for ladies only cost a dollar. Tell her that theyre 
either successful, up and coming, or have street smarts. Your hot friend will humor 
these men, because since shes your friend she's probably nice. Usually the mean hot 
girls travel solo, or in packs of other mean hot girls.
These men come in all shapes and sizes, but most of them are ugly and stu
pid. They stand between you and the hot girl at the bar, in attempts of intersecting eye 
rolls and escape tactics that you have planned with your free time. You will have an 
impetus to plan these escapes because most guys who go after your friend purposefully 
ignore you to let the hot girl know just how hot she is. This tactic sometimes works, not 
because your friend is evil, but because she thinks shes ugly. Thats the curse of the 
really hot girl. She think her legs are too skinny, or her breasts are too small or her 
nose is set too high on her face. You know about her insecurities, from her complaining 
to you on the phone, or confiding in your when shes drunk. Always in a whisper, as if 
shes never told anyone about these fears before. You come to feel sorry for her. So, 
you let these guys try to woo her for a minute or two before you intervene.
Each area of a bar is assigned its own method of ditching an undesirable man. 
Standing at the bar itself is the most fun for you. The skills you learned in acting class 
when you were twelve come in handy here. You were always given roles like the Evil 
Queen or Stepmother because of your attitude.
Say a short guy wearing corduroys and a button down shirt dances up to the 
two of you at a bar of a top forty club. You always see him coming from a long way off 
and try to put your back to him, or get her to accompany you to the bathroom. Usually 
though you aren't quick enough, and the breed of man who likes your friend is really 
determined anyway. He approaches, puts his hand in your shoulder, looks both of you 
over and then addresses your friend. Its the same each time.
Why aren't you dancing?" is the generic line for dance clubs, but if the music 
is a specific genre such as swing or salsa, there are slight variations. "Do you know how 
to do this crazy thing?" or a completely resistible, Come on, dance with me." These 
lines work in the same way as a prompts during a monologue. Once you hear them, 
you know exactly how the play goes from there. Your friend hasnt picked up on the 
patter. She treats each of these men as if they are unique.
"Betsy and I are taking a break," she says, because she has learned enough to

---------------------------------------------------

use your stage names. He offers his name and a handshake.
You ignore this guy and shake your shoulder from his grip. Give 
your friend a look she never understands, even though you give it to her 
five or six times a night. Its a look that says, Hes a loser. Ignore him." 
She never does though.
"You know what I like about you," he says and moves between 
the two of you. "You have everything I like." You slam your drink while 
they chat. Soon you and your hot friend will be dancing alone. He com
pliments her clothes or her long legs or the way she dances. He buys her 
a drink and she insists that he buy a drink for you as well. You thank 
him, but never out loud because hes not listening to you anyway. Theres 
usually a porn playing on the TV above the bar and you watch this and 
wait for your next cue. Then he says to your friend, "I bought you a drink 
and I dont even know your name."
Patty-ella," she says. A variation on her real name. She thinks 
its cute, and the guys always try to use it as a step off for flirting.
"Is that your real name? they ask. Did your mother name you 
that?" and she says yes, while you get off your bar stool and move to her 
side.
What kind of name is that?" they ask innocently. You examine 
this guy more closely. His mouth has a natural sneer you don't like, or 
poofy eyelids and a crooked tooth. Theres always something. Hes taking 
in your friend's body with his whole face, looking up and down, like hes 
memorizing his favorite parts for later. Its time for you to twist his words 
and send him on his way.
"Where I come from," you say, pulling a cherry stem out of your 
mouth-preferably with a knot in it if you can manage. "If you make fun 
of someone's name, you're asking for a fight." They always stare at you, 
not able to remember your name. Wondering where you came from. They 
tell you they didn't mean anything by it. You never tell them your name 
when they ask for it. You interrupt them and claim to be from an old 
Italian mob family. Suddenly you and Patty-ella are sisters. Your grandpa 
would have killed a man if he know he was making fun of his grand
daughters name. He looks to your friend for help, but she sips her drink 
and smiles faintly. She knows this part of the script.
"Lets dance," she says and leads you to the dance floor. The 
guy is left confused at the bar. Sorry that he left you out of the conversa
tion.
Rhythm takes over your hot friend's body| She moves like water
through pipes, with pressure and purpose. You try to'keep up with her, a little.shaky still from yelling at the guy. She's already drunk; being so thin, and 
dances seductively. The two of you dance together! movipg around each other 
in circles, never touching, but with eyes locked. Tli^re is a bad sprig playing, 
one that you've never heard before, so that makes it worse. But you know that 
everyone in the room is looking at you and your ho|frjehd!so you don't care.,. 
When youve found your groove and youre having a^pqd time basking in your 
youth and freedom of expression, another annoyingjgy will cme up,and; ruin r, 
everything. The method of getting rid of one of yo^rmot friends guys while 1  
dancing is difficult. Its much more personal. | p .. .*1
The first problem is that he usually thinks he's an exceptional dancer. 
He swoops in and out of nowhere and rubs his sweaty;body on her, in a move
ment just shy of the beat. The force of his hips and shoulders grinding into 
hers doesn't give her the immediate option of saying po. She dances with him/ , 
ignoring you. You move around him so she'll knowiyou're there if she needs 
help. She doesn't look for you.
Rejected, you turn around and dance alonej' Some of the best moves, 
you've ever done are coming out tonight, and no orj important is watch/ng. 
There's usually a sweaty emaciated man who mak$^eyes at you from across  
the dance floor, but you shake your head at him. Jjie real freak shows come . 
after you the nights that you go out with your hot fnend. A snse iof cama
raderie propels them in your direction. Midgets, gt jn trench,cqat^ and steel 
toed pointy boots doing interpretive dance, blindly/drunk frat Ipoys, W|to are too 
sloshed to see the girl you came with, all flock to you during tfa ti.me:fhat your 
friend's dancing with this man.
If you go out with other cute girls, normal looking guys apprq^ch you. 
They buy you drinks sometimes and try to dance wit^' you. Most times you get 
drunk enough to talk to the guys on your own. The ons Who sitat thp bgr by 
themselves, wearing a tee shirt .and have messed up jhair. You viityun|ij they 
are having a moment to themselves before you ask,them. how. they're doirigV,
Or, if you know there's only one song left of the nifeht, if they want to dance..! 
Because if they turn out to be horrific dancers, you;don-t want to get' stuck 
with them all night long. The nights when you go oyt with;normallooking girls 
are fun. You get a chance to be the center of attejjifep./;Fdjj.^^jea^n^:. 
though, you continue to hang out with this hot friend.
Just when you consider dancing with the midget, because it would at 
least be an interesting story to have, your hot friend comes back to you.

---------------------------------------------------

From the way she's elbowing you in the back, she needs your help. 
Wandering hands or strange gyrations usually prompt her return. Even though 
youre still mad at her for leaving, you come to her aid. Hairy fingers grip her 
small wrist, twisting her from side to side. You dance over to her and she pulls 
away. The two of you dance off to the side, leaving the man alone. He tries to 
sandwich himself between the two of you, but youre hot friend never lets that 
happen. Once in a while, this man will single you out after hes failed with your 
friend.
He is obviously an idiot if he thinks youd fall for the same moves he 
tried on someone else right in front of you. You turn away from him violently 
and he continues to dance at your side. He puts his mouth to your ear and says 
that the two of you are sexy.
"I know, were lovers," you say. That usually makes them go away.
You often wonder why guys never dispute the lesbian line when every single girl 
has used it. There Would be a sharp and deadly population drop if there were 
actually that many lesbians in the world.
This guy has to leave quickly because if your friend sees you dancing 
with him, she will develop an interest in him. Not because she feels jealous, 
but because she thinks that you approve of him. Since you dislike almost every
one she meets at these clubs, she anxiously holds on to the ones you do like.
So you turn away from him sharply because otherwise he could hang out with 
the two of you all night. Or, your friend could go home with him. That happens 
sometimes. If you leave your friend alone for too long while you go to the bath
room, or if she had started drinking alone before the two of you went out, this 
pre-party drinking information never comes out until she trips over an invisible 
crack in the dance floor or mistakes someone at the bar for Cheet Russell, a guy 
who died in a boating accident during your junior year of high school.
If the lesbian line doesn't work, you remove her from the scene. Offer 
to buy her another drink, whether she needs one or not. On the way to the bar, 
shell get a few hellos and people will grab her arm. Dont let her stop. Shell 
share a laugh with you about the hazards of being a woman. You smile back, 
but you don't feel like a woman anymore.. You feel like a body guard, no matter 
how sober you are.
Protecting her from men is time consuming but conceivable.
Protecting your friend from herself is impossible. Tequila shots are ordered 
when your back is turned, along with Guinness chasers. Its past midnight by 
this point, and drink prices are back to normal. You offer to pay, but she never 
lets you. Like most hot girls who arent actresses or waitresses, shes a secretary.
