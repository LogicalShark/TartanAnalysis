Students spend alternative break abroad
CLAIRE MORGENSTERN
Dossier Literary Editor
The culture shock most 
students experience during 
spring break is the trauma of 
temporarily moving back into 
their parents house or the 
mind-numbing headache of too 
many consecutive hours spent 
in an arcade. But a handful of 
Carnegie Mellon students will 
experience true culture shock as 
they prepare to travel across the 
country (or even outside of it) to 
aid underserved, underdevel
oped communities.
This March, students on Car
negie Mellons Alternative Break 
program will travel to a reserve 
on the coast of Ecuador; at the 
same time, another group of 
student volunteers will fly to El 
Paso, Texas to build houses for 
working class families on behalf 
of Habitat for Humanity.
As these students gear up for 
their trips, they must prepare
not only by reading background 
information on the area they 
will visit and learning new skills 
necessary for the trip, but also 
emotionally by readying them
selves to view a different side of 
the world  and then be able to 
leave it all behind.
To students who have expe
rience in the first world, to be 
dropped in coastal Ecuador is 
like flying to another universe, 
said Kenya Dworkin y Mendez, 
a Spanish professor at Carnegie 
Mellon and supporter of the Al
ternative Break program since 
its inception in 2005 as the 
fifth-year scholar project of Nuveen Marwah, a 2006 graduate 
of the Tepper School of Business.
In the past, the group has 
visited the Gulf Coast to help 
victims of Hurricane Katrina and 
to San Diego to work with the 
Border Angels, an organization 
that provides aid Mexican immigrantswho would otherwise die 
while crossing the border.
[This year] were doing a va
riety of environmental activities, 
working in a school, building 
a fence, and volunteering for a 
hospital, said Abby Morrell, a 
junior mechanical engineering 
major who is one of the 12 stu
dents going on the trip.
Dworkin has been prepar
ing the group for departure by 
providing readings and other 
resources about the area in 
which the students will be work
ing. She has also been pushing 
them to consider the more dif
ficult questions concerning the 
situation into which they will en
ter in Ecuador.
Whats the relationship 
between the reserve and the sur
rounding communities? Does the 
reserve employ local residents? 
What are the residents like, and 
what are their needs? Those are 
the kinds of questions you have 
to ask, Dworkin said.
The students of Habitat for Hu
manity are preparing differently.
Theyre brushing up on the skills 
they will need to build a house, 
including framing walls, ap
plying trusses and roofing, and 
other tasks. The trip has been 
an annual event for the group 
for the past several years. Last 
spring, the group built a house in 
Florida.
Last year, the best experience 
was just learning how to use the 
tools, said Nadia Bosan, a ju
nior civil engineering major and 
co-chair of the spring break trip.
Once they arrive in El Paso, 
which is on the western border 
of Texas between the U.S. and 
Mexico, the students will work 
for five days with Habitat for Hu
manity of El Paso to construct a 
house.
Well be constructing, if not 
the whole house, at least the ex
ternal structure, said Matthew 
Deutsch, a sophomore electrical 
and computer engineering major

Middle class gets 
first-class college aid
MARILUZ ORBAY

Middle-child syndrome could 
be seeing a cure sometime soon, 
at least in terms of financial aid 
at Ivy League colleges. Harvard 
University, Dartmouth College, 
and Yale University, among oth
ers, have implemented financial 
aid policies aimed specifically at 
the middle class income bracket.
On Jan. 16, Dartmouth an
nounced that it will offer free 
tuition to students with an an
nual family income of less than 
$75,000. They will also replace 
loans with institutional schol
arships and extend need-blind 
admissions to all international 
students.
Dartmouths tuition costs are 
comparable to those at most uni
versities, with tuition, room, and 
board coming to a grand total ol 
$45,483.
Dartmouth based its decision 
on data from the most recent U. S. 
Census, which indicated that 70 
percent of U.S. households make 
less than $75,000 annually and 
that median family earning is 
$46,326. It also holds that 13 
percent of Dartmouth students 
are first-generation college stu
dents and that 14 percent receive 
federal Pell grants, which are 
meant specifically for students 
from low-income families.
According to The New York 
Times, Dartmouth is trying to 
add $1.3 billion to endowment 
funds, including $150 million 
specifically intended for finanSee AID, pageA4
First-years enjoy 
parental attention

A new study shows that the an
noyance of helicopter parents may 
be a thing of the past, for college 
first-years at least. According to 
an annual survey by the Higher 
Education Research Institutes at 
UCLA, 84 percent of students con
sidered their parents involvement 
in their decision to go to college to 
be the right amount.
Helicopter parents were widely 
accepted among first-years, with 
about 73 percent of students 
happy with the level of parental 
involvement in choosing college 
courses and organizations to join.
Pamela Golubski, associate di
rector of first-year experience and 
advisement in CIT, had much to 
add on trends in helicopter par
ents.
In recent years I have seen less 
parent involvement, Golubski 
said. Parents are more aware oi 
helicopter parents and are embar
rassed to be one. Just compared to 
last year I had much less parents 
e-mailing me about their kids.
Golubski mentioned that the 
changing trends might be the re
sult of efforts from the school.
In the past year, CIT has put up 
a website dedicated to parents
See SURVEY, page A3
Tomorrow is Super Tuesday, 
when over 20 states will hold 
either caucuses or primaries. 
But some university presidents 
have already weighed in; the 
presidents of the University of 
Florida, the University of Miami, 
the State University of New York 
at Old Westbury, and Liberty Uni
versity, among others, have all 
publicly endorsed candidates for 
the 2008 presidential election.
The most recent endorsement 
came on Jan. 21, when John Mc
Cains campaign issued a press 
release announcing University 
of Florida President Bernie Machens support. While the last 
sentence of the press release said 
that Machens opinion must not 
be misconstrued as an endorse
ment by the University of Flor
ida, the headline of the press 
release itself mentioned Machen 
as the universitys president.
I feel like endorsements are 
definitely publicized and used 
just as headlines by the cam
paigns, said Gabby Moskowitz, 
a sophomore computer science 
major who is a member of Col
lege Democrats and an intern 
at the Pennsylvania League of 
Young Voters.
While these endorsements 
make headlines in press re
leases and the media, there are 
differing opinions as to their 
appropriateness.
I dont think it is within the 
role of a university president, 
said Carnegie Mellon President 
Jared L. Cohon. A university 
president is a citizen with a right 
to free speech. However, for the 
president of a university, speak
ing as an individual is the same 
as speaking as a university.
Student Body Vice President 
Adi Jain, a senior business ad
ministration and electrical and 
computer engineering major, 
agreed with Cohon.
I find it shocking, Jain said 
of the recent endorsements. 
There is a certain amount of 
responsibility that comes with a 
leadership role, which I feel like 
the university president over
looked in this case.
Moskowitz insisted that an en
dorsement is acceptable as long as 
it doesnt become campaigning.
There is a difference between 
a press release and a rally, 
Moskowitz said. As voters, uni
versity presidents can endorse a 
candidate as long as there is no 
promotion or actions done for 
the campaign.
As to the effect on students, 
Moskowitz maintained that there 
will be no effect since those who 
will actually vote already have
their opinions set.
Cohon hoped that these en
dorsements might make students 
think more about the candidates 
and their issues in objecting or 
agreeing with their universitys 
presidents.
Jain saw the issue as more of a 
public relations ploy 
It would increase a particu
lar candidates visibility within 
that universitys population, 
Jain said, which a lot of times 
is enough to get a few votes out 
of voters who are either not 
very educated regarding candi
dates platforms and positions or 
undecided.
The list of college endorse
ments includes public, private, 
and religiously affiliated colleges, 
all of which have been under the 
spotlight lately.
Donna E. Shalala, president 
of the University of Miami, a 
private instituation, endorsed
j.w. Kamp/rnoio taitor & Allison nper/Assistant Knoto taitor
Hillary Clinton.
Although Shalalas endorse
ment came as no surprise since 
she served as a Cabinet member 
in the Clinton administration, 
her endorsement was so public 
that she even appeared on The 
Colbert Report.
Bob Jones III, president of 
Bob Jones College, labeled his 
endorsement of Mitt Romney as 
that of a private citizen on the 
schools homepage.
However, some universities 
have met with outside obstacles 
following their presidents en
dorsements.
When Jerry Falwell Jr., the 
chancellor of Baptist-affiliated 
Liberty University endorsed Mike 
Huckabee, Americans United for 
Separation of Church and State 
held a federal investigation as to 
whether the university violated 
federal tax laws in backing a bi
partisan campaign.
For other university presi
dents, their endorsements had 
implications extending beyond 
their campuses.
The endorsement of Hillary 
Clinton from Reverend Calvin
O. Butts III, the president of the 
State University of New York 
at Old Westbury, had a double 
meaning. He is both the univer
sitys president and the pastor 
of the Abyssian Baptist Church, 
one of the most influential black 
churches in the United States.
Many people seemed to think 
voters excitement is the reason 
for so many university president 
endorsements, and endorse
ments in general, in this years 
elections.
I cant remember the last time 
there were so many It might just 
be a reaction to how excited peo
ple are for this years elections,

President Cohon and ice dancer represent university well
Cohon travels to Switzerland
The 2008 World Economic Forum, held 
the week of Jan. 23, was marked by 
the presence of political and economic 
leaders from around the globe. Co-chairs 
at the event included the former prime 
minister of the United Kingdom, Tony 
Blair, and a former U.S. secretary of state, 
Henry Kissinger.
Although many of the participants, 
including actress Emma Thompson and 
U2s Bono, are by no means strangers to 
Carnegie Mellon students, one in particu
lar was exceedingly familiar: President 
Jared L. Cohon. Cohon was one of many 
who journeyed to the forum in Davos, 
Switzerland to discuss the issues faced by 
todays society.
The invitation to take part in the 
Forum is a sign that Carnegie Mellons 
commitment to becoming a global university has been recognized, and that our 
university is seen as a place of creativity, 
innovation, and knowledge generation 
with a key role to play in meeting the 
worlds most urgent needs, Cohon com
mented in a press release.
The World Economic Forum is based 
in Geneva, Switzerland and was founded 
in 1971 by Klaus Schwab, who at that 
time was a professor of business admin
istration at the University of Geneva. It 
is designed to help improve the state of 
the world and to give political leaders a 
unique opportunity to discuss current is
sues in a neutral setting.
The forum is an opportunity for discus
sion and change and, as Cohon stated in a 
press release, participating in the World 
Economic Forum is a great honor for me 
and my university.
Ice dancing pair in nationals
Although it is common for Carnegie 
Mellon students to have diverse inter
ests, junior Peter Rodgers-Fischl takes 
it to an extreme.
Fischl, a chemical and biomedi
cal engineering double major and an 
Army ROTC participant, also happens 
to be a national competitor in the sport 
of ice dancing. His partner, Marsha 
Synder, is the coach of the Robert 
Morris University collegiate synchro
nized skating team.
After placing second in the U.S. 
Figure Skating Eastern Sectionals in 
November, Fischl and Synder earned a 
spot at the U.S. Figure Skating Senior 
Ice Dancing national championship. 
The event was held in St. Paul, Minn, 
between Jan. 23rd and Jan. 26. Before
leaving for the competition, Fischl 
stated in a press release, This the 
event of my lifetime. Ive been training 
for 15 years. We get to go on the ice 
with Olympic teams.
Although Fischl and Synder have 
plenty of experience as individual 
skaters, they have only been practic
ing together for about one year while 
most pairs at the national level have 
had four or five years of experience 
as a team.
Despite this disadvantage, the pair is 
coming on strong, placing 12th in the 
national competition after the open 
dance portion on Friday, Jan. 25.

Changing first-years
New survey examines student trendsSophomore honor society serves community
Courtesy of Amy NicholsLambda Sigma sophomores do various service projects throughout Pittsburgh and internationally during the year.
DAWN WANG
Junior Staffwriter
For first-years with too much 
free time on their hands, ser
vice opportunities may be the 
perfect way to fill up the extra 
hours. Lambda Sigma, a sopho
more honor society, sent out in
vitations to eligible first-year stu
dents last week.
While we have a QPA require
ment of a 3.5, there is, in no way, 
an academic focus to our orga
nization, said Carolina Velez, 
sophomore social and decision 
sciences major and president of 
Lambda Sigma. We are devoted 
to servicing the community 
in projects all throughout the 
year.
Carnegie Mellons Eta chapter 
is part of the Lambda Sigma na
tional organization that honors 
sophomore students and orga
nizes service activities at various 
colleges and universities across 
the nation.
For the Carnegie Mellon 
chapter, February is a month 
of getting to know inductees, 
officially inducting them, and 
continuous service projects.
The first upcoming event is a 
visit to Oaklands Schenley High 
School, where Lambda Sigma 
will inform and motivate stu
dents about options for higher 
education. The event will also 
have a raffle for an iPod Nano, 
which Lambda Sigma bought 
with money from a fundraiser 
last semester at Max & Ermas.
Students qualify for the raffle 
by filling out a questionnaire, 
which is designed to help them 
organize their hopes and anxiet
ies for the future. The students 
will be informed about op
tions beyond just conventional 
twoand four-year colleges 
and community schools. Other 
options include faith-based 
colleges, culinary institutes, and 
training programs. To make the 
process more accessible, Lambda 
Sigma students have petitioned 
for the institutes to waive appli
cation fees for the participants.
Amy Nichols, a sophomore 
psychology major and the se
lections chair of Lambda Sigma 
explained what she hopes to get 
out of the Schenley project.
We hope by breaking down 
cost barriers to encourage stu
dents to recognize their options, 
and to talk to us about their 
questions and concerns, we can 
impact a students choice to ap
ply to college, Nichols said.
Lambda Sigma has already 
connected its influence in the 
school to the community by
convincing Carnegie Mellons 
director of admissions, Michael 
Steidel, to waive the universitys 
application fees for the events 
participants.
In addition to serving the local 
community, the Carnegie Mel
lon chapter of Lambda Sigma is 
interested in achieving a global 
influence.
For example, Velezs recent visit 
to Medellin, Colombia, inspired 
her to create a new project to help 
locals in a small neighborhood, 
La Quintana. The neighborhood 
has recently experienced a surge 
in the population due to the dan
gers of rural violence. As a result, 
funds are needed to provide 
books and school supplies for 
the refugee families, otherwise 
unable to provide schooling for 
their children. Plans to organize 
a fundraising Rock Band com
petition in the University Center 
at the end of the month are al
ready set in motion.
Other events include a blood 
drive on March 26.
Lambda Sigma also plans to 
get more involved on campus, 
as its members will be build
ing a Spring Carnival booth for 
the first time in its history. The 
theme of the booth will be voter 
registration. Registration forms, 
candidate information, and a
computer to register with will all. 
be made available on spot.
Velez found her experience in 
Lambda Sigma to be more re
warding than she expected.
I love that you can see re
sults, Velez said. It is refreshing 
to see students taking a moment 
from their busy lives and help
ing someone else. It is difficult 
to look beyond your daily life, 
but we have an obligation to give 
back.
Stanley Liu, a sophomore biol
ogy major and the vice president 
of Lambda Sigma, echoed Velezs 
sentiments.
My life is about serving soci
ety, he said, and so is Lambda 
Sigma.
Lambda Sigma will be holding 
an ice cream social for all pro
spective first-years tomorrow at
8 p.m. in UC Danforth. All of the 
executive board will be present, 
including Velez, Nichols, and 
Liu, as well as Boo Kim, sopho
more electrical and computer 
engineering major and secretary 
of Lambda Sigma.
Applications are due Feb. 
15, no later than 4 p.m., in the 
Career Center. Eligible stu
dents should contact Nichols at 
aenichols@cmu.edu with any 
questions or concerns.
SURVEY, fromAl 
who want to be more involved in 
their childrens lives, in addition 
to holding Parent Orientation.
Its important to educate par
ents on relevant legal policies, 
Golubski said.
Many parents just arent 
aware of FERPA, the Family 
Educational Rights and Privacy 
Act that prevents anyone from 
the administration from divulg
ing information about their kids 
grades to them, Golubski said.
Mo Satyshur, a first-year 
H&SS student, was surprised 
by how many students were 
satisfied with their parental 
involvement.
I would assume that most stu
dents feel that their parents have 
too much control over them, Sa
tyshur said. I know my friends 
think so. Parents, I think, need 
to know that students need to 
learn to fend for themselves and 
to learn to solve their own issues. 
Thats what college is for.
However, some contend that 
there hasnt been much change 
in parental involvement with 
first-years.
Anne Witchner, director of 
Orientation and first-year ac
tivities, suggested that the way 
students think about their par
ents is changing, rather than the 
parents themselves.
It isnt that parents are less 
involved, students are just more 
used to their involvement, 
Witchner said. Parents can 
be challenging for the faculty, 
administration, and students. 
But the world of young people 
today is so different. We live in 
the world of 9/11 and Virginia 
Tech.
The survey addressed many 
areas concerning first-years, in
cluding parental involvement, 
participation in student organi
zations, incentive for community 
service, and political liberalism.
For each area, there were dif
ferences in opinion across racial 
and ethnic groups.
In parental involvement, for 
example, white students were 
the least likely to want more pa
rental involvement in college, 
with only 4.2 percent opting for 
more. Latino students, followed 
by Asian and Native American
students, were the most likely 
with 11.5 percent, 8.4 percent, 
and 8.1 percent, repectively.
However, in many of these 
trends, students of both genders 
replied similarly.
When asked how they spent 
their time weekly before col
lege, 73.4 percent of students 
reported spending more than six 
hours socializing with friends, 
while only 33.9 percent reported 
spending this long on studying 
and homework.
The survey also addressed 
the way first-year students get 
involved in the community, 
showing that 53.2 percent of 
first-years have shown a moti
vation to understand and get 
involved with the world around 
them.
Witchner mentioned ar
chitecture students studying 
LEED-friendly (Leadership in 
Energy and Environmental De
sign) buildings and green design 
as examples at Carnegie Mellon.
Golubski agreed with Witch
ner that students are feeling 
more compelled to get involved.
Students are much more in
quisitive, Golubski said. This 
summer I recieved 3500 e-mails 
from the incoming class. They 
are diverse in themselves and 
want to take charge of the world. 
More and more students are minoring in languages or coming 
to school already wanting to 
study abroad.
Golubski said that first-year 
involvement has also expanded 
in terms of community service.
Students are now taking the 
initiative to make a change, 
Golubski said. The CIT students 
doubled the number of charities 
theyre participating in, all with
out any suggestion.
First-year MCS student Quinn 
Weisman sees this student in
volvement in the general atmo
sphere at Carnegie Mellon.
All the fraternities and so
rorities on campus are always 
raising awareness for some 
cause and the student advisory 
boards can be seen tabling for 
every major cause, Weisman 
said. Students care.

Ivy League leads in middle income aid packages
AID,fromAl
cial aid. The campaign passed 
the $1 billion point last month.
Harvard and Yale acted before 
Dartmouth in taking similar mea
sures to facilitate financial aid for 
students from middle-class fami
lies.
When Harvard President Law
rence Summers 
announced 
the Zero to 
Ten Percent 
Standard
>X
in December 2007, he spoke in 
favor of not letting opportunities 
for talented students be depen
dent on financial circumstance.
Our doors have long been 
open to talented students regard
less of financial need, Summers 
stated in a press release. But 
many students simply do not 
know or believe this. We are de
termined to change both the per
ception and the reality.
This is definitely a step in the 
right direction, said Michelle 
Pena, a junior business major. It 
targets those who make too much 
to qualify, but dont have enough
to actually pay.
Harvard provides free tu
ition for those who make under 
$60,000. Families with incomes 
between $120,000 and $180,000 
are expected to pay 10 percent of 
their income and the percentages 
decrease from there until reach
ing zero at $60,000.
Yale announced a similar pol
icy last month. The university 
expects families with incomes 
between $120,000 and $200,000 
to pay 10 percent of their income. 
The percentages decrease until 
$60,000 at which, like Harvard, 
tuition then becomes free.
As of yet, Carnegie Mellon has 
not made any changes in its fi
nancial aid policies.
Carnegie Mellon Vice Presi
dent for Enrollment William 
Elliott stated that Carnegie Mel
lon is not in the financial position 
to make changes.
This trend is only among the 
very, very wealthy, Elliott said. 
There is a magnitude of differ
ence between our endowment 
and Harvards.
According to university data, 
Carnegie Mellon had an esti
mated endowment of about $1.1 
billion in 2007. Harvard, Yale, 
and Dartmouth had endowments 
of $29.2 billion, $20 billion, and 
$3.5 billion, respectively.
While Harvard, Yale, and Dart
mouth de
veloped 
their 
own 
p o 1 i - 
cies on 
expected family 
contribution, Carnegie Mellon 
bases its financial aid policies 
on the Federal Methodology 
developed by Congress. The for
mula generates an Estimated 
Family Contribution (EFC) based 
on what it is deemed appropriate 
as a combined total of student 
and parent contribution.
Carnegie Mellon offers a com
bination of loans, grants, and 
institutional scholarships in its 
package. It also offers a number 
of merit-based scholarships for 
each of the academic programs. 
International students are not 
considered for any aid.
Students are allowed to obtain 
up to $6000 in outside grants and 
scholarships before their institu
tional package is reduced.
Carnegie Mellon offers no spe
cific policies for certain income 
brackets.
While adjustments by Har
vard, Yale, and Dartmouth ben
efit prospective middle class stu
dents, the upper income bracket 
remains completely unaided.
I dont think this is unfair be
cause these other classes have 
incomes that allow them to pay, 
Pena said.
First-year engineering major 
Mana Ameri brought up the fact 
that within upper class families, 
special circumstances exist.
A high income means noth
ing, Ameri said. For example, 
medical bills; more often than 
not a lot of families with special 
medical needs or any other kind 
of costly expense apart from col
lege, which surprisingly enough 
does, happen, are left facing the 
same amount of need of financial 
assistance as say, any family with 
an income considered as low. 
However, Pena noted that the 
upper-class students still have 
the opportunity to apply for 
merit-based aid.
Theres always merit scholar
ships, Pena said. These are best 
for upper-class students because 
their incomes show that they can 
pay more easily and the other 
classes need the institutional 
money more.
There are mixed opinions as 
to how  and when  these 
financial aid initiatives will af
fect students applying to college.
I dont think that this will 
necessarily affect the students 
who apply since financial aid is 
decided after acceptance, Pena 
said.
However, Pena noted that if 
colleges such as Dartmouth, Har
vard, and Yale get more students 
after these initiatives, other col
leges might follow the trend.
All of the upper-crust schools 
are competing for the same core 
of students, Pena said. So, if 
these colleges begin taking away 
from this group, the trend will 
definitely spread.
In Carnegie Mellons 2006 ad
mitted student survey, students 
were asked to rank Carnegie 
Mellon with its competitors in 29 
areas.
On average, Carnegie Mellon 
was ranked superior in 26 of the 
areas. The only three areas not 
included in this number were 
competitive athletics, balance of 
men and women, and generous 
financial aid.
Colleges such as ours that 
dont have endowments like Har
vard have to be conservative [in 
financial aid], Elliott said.
Elliott emphasized that our 
university cannot be compared 
to an Ivy League institution.
What we do in financial aid 
may be very different, Elliott 
said. It all goes back to endow
ments.
For now, the trend of set finan
cial aid policies for the middle 
class income bracket remains con
tained to Ivy League institutions.
Students construct houses for the needy over spring break
BREAK, fromAl
who is one of the 20 students go
ing on the trip.
One of 1800 Habitat for Hu
manity affiliates, the El Paso 
affiliate is unique because it 
constructs homes that use solar 
power, which is good for the en
vironment and saves homeown
ers an average of $25 a month 
on energy bills. The affiliate was 
also the first builder in the area to 
receive an Energy Star certifi
cation from the Environmental 
Protection Agency.
Habitat for Humanity students 
receive no academic credit for 
their endeavor; Alternative Break 
volunteers have the option of re
ceiving three units of academic 
credit through the department 
of modern languages by produc
ing a creative analysis of their ex
perience during the trip, such as 
a report, website, film, or photo 
essay.
[Offering credit] is a way to 
provide institutional recognition 
for the student experience and 
give the trip an educational com
ponent that can be measured,
Dworkin said. The university 
sees the value of [the program] 
because it provides academic 
value, intellectual value. Ive seen 
these end products as contribut
ing to departments webpages. In 
the future, I would like to have 
this model, adapted to other de
partments.
However, Dworkin reminds 
students that theres no reason 
to assume that everything you do 
should receive credit. Although 
the department of modern lan
guages handles the transfer of 
academic credit, Dworkin main
tains that Alternative Break is an 
otherwise completely studentrun organization.
Regardless of the differences 
between'the two spring break 
programs, the goal of both groups 
is the same  to help.
I hope to help build a house 
and in the end, help people who 
need places to live, Bosan said.
Morrell expressed the same 
sentiment.
Ive never been on a service 
trip, and that was something 
missing from my experience, she 
said. I hope for it to be a chang
ing experience for me, kind of an 
eye-opener.
Dworkin wishes students all 
the best on their adventures this 
spring.
I think its fabulous that theyre 
doing it, she said. I foresee lots 
more trips down the road.
The enrollment of both of the 
spring break trips is closed. For 
more information on Alternative 
Break, contact Guatam Daswani 
at ghd@andrew. For Habitat for 
Humanity, contact Yvonne Kiat at 
ydk@andrew.
Colleges 
take on 
elections
A record number 
of university 
leaders endorse 
candidates
ENDORSEMENTS, fromAl
Cohon said.
Cohon, who traveled to both 
Switzerland and India in the 
past two weeks, cited a tre
mendous interest in the U.S 
primaries abroad.
Moskowitz agreed with 
Cohon that this yeari 
endorsements were a result o) 
widespread excitement.
However, Moskowitz ques
tioned student excitement lev
els on campus.
There is widespread talk ol 
Super Bowl parties, Moskow
itz said. But what about c 
Super Tuesday viewing party?
Cohon spoke of the 2004 
elections on campus in which, 
after the primaries, a rally wa5 
held on campus for John Kerr} 
and the same was offered tc 
George Bush.
I would be happy to host ral
lies and hold forums and moci 
debates, Cohon said. Any
thing that increases student 
awareness is a good pro.
Jain expressed his belief thal 
during elections, universitiei 
and their leaders should be a 
vocal as student organizations 
are year round.
Imagine if the university 
spent the time publicizing vot
ing in the same way that some 
of these student organizations 
publicize their events, Jair 
said.
With Super Tuesday tomor
row and the primaries in fuL 
swing, the talk of endorsements 
and presidential candidates is 
nowhere near its end.

Microsoft bids on 
Yahoo
Silicon Valley has been abuzz 
since Friday when technology 
powerhouse Microsoft offered 
to buy out search engine Yahoo 
Inc. in what experts are say
ing would be a shotgun mar
riage. The leaders of Yahoo are 
taking some time to consider 
Microsofts bid, which came to 
nearly $42 billion.
Though the potential transac
tion involves only Microsoft and 
Yahoo, many claim that the bid 
is a reflection on the success of 
Google Inc., which is clearly the 
motivation for Microsoft to look 
to Yahoo.
Microsoft is still the leader in 
worldwide technology, through 
it is questionable how the com
pany will continue to fare in 
a market dominated by online 
services and advertising.
Even if Yahoo accepts the 
bid, it is unclear whether the 
transaction would pass antitrust 
regulations.

Double dipping' 
proves dangerous
Asia, Middle East 
lose Internet access
A widespread Internet outage 
on Thursday debilitated regions 
of Asia, North Africa, and the 
Middle East, causing particular 
damage to businesses reliant on 
telecommunications. Some of 
the affected countries included 
Qatar, Egypt, and India.
Experts trade the problem to 
breaks in two undersea cables. 
No one knows what caused the 
damage, though some sources 
have claimed that a ships anchor 
might have torn the cables.
Though some of the affected 
countries governments have 
satellite systems to provide 
backup Internet service, others 
were left essentially in the dark. 
Some experts called the outage 
a wake-up call for countries 
that were unprepared for inci
dents like this one.
A third cable near Dubai was 
cut on Friday, aggravating the 
delays.

Black Death hit 
those already sick
Two anthropologists have 
found evidence to suggest that 
the majority of the victims of 
Europes Black Death plague 
were already ill. The researchers 
study, published Monday, helps 
explain differences between the 
plague and other illnesses, like 
the Spanish flu and HIV, which 
more often kill healthy people.
Researchers studied the 
exhumed bodies of 490 skele
tons from a cemetery in London. 
While examining the bodies, 
they were able to note the ages 
of the deceased by looking at 
their dental regions. They also 
looked at bone lesions to deter
mine prior illnesses. The scien
tists compared the bodies from 
the cemetery to a group from 
a Danish cemetery that was 
buried a few years before the 
plague started.
Scientists hope to use the data 
to study current diseases similar 
to the plague, including Ebola 
and SARS.

Student, teacher 
find dark matter
A high school astronomy 
teacher and an llth-grade 
student from Pennsylvanias 
Venango County detected dark 
matter in a disk surrounding the 
binary star WZ Sagittae. Dark 
matter is a term for matter in 
the universe that cannot be seen 
directly but produces gravita
tion effects on visible matter.
The student and teacher 
observed dark matter in the 
stars accretion disk, hot gas that 
builds up stars and other mass
es. This suggests that accretion 
disks are more massive than sci
entists once thought.

Seizure drugs make 
patients suicidal
Patients who take drugs for 
epilepsy, bipolar disorder, and 
other mood disorders are at 
an increased risk for suicidal 
behavior.
The Food and Drug 
Administration reported four 
suicides and 105 reports of sui
cidal symptoms among 43,892 
patients who take drugs like 
Depakote, Lamictal, Topamax, 
Keppra, Lyrica, and Neurontin
 drugs that are also prescribed 
for headaches.
While this information is 
important for caregivers, it 
should not bring about a change 
in the treatment of epilepsy, 
explained Laureen Cassidy, 
spokeswoman for Abbott, the 
company that makes Depakote.
Medical specialists argue that 
injuries caused by prolonged 
seizures can be avoided by tak
ing these drugs, which makes 
the drugs worth a try.
CMU grad student designs robot leg
A recent study shows that 
double dipping may be more 
hazardous than you think. The 
phrase, popularized by the 
Seinfeld episode in which George 
is confronted at a funeral after 
dipping the same chip twice, 
has been making its rounds at 
parties ever since.
Professor Paul Dawson, a 
food microbiologist at Clemson 
University, investigated this 
claim by analyzing the microbial 
transfer that takes place from 
mouth to chip to dip. The results 
showed that between three and 
six double dips caused roughly 
10,000 bacteria from the dip
pers mouth into the dip.
Assuming that each chip picks 
up two grams of dip, double dip
ping could transfer anywhere 
from 50 to 100 bacteria per 
bite.

Hand washing 
linked to dermatitis
Health care workers routinely 
wash their hands more than 10 
times a day.
However, a new study present
ed by Susan T. Nedorost, M.D., 
FAAD (Fellow of the American 
Academy of Dermatology), an 
associate professor of dermatol
ogy at University Hospitals Case 
Medical Center, shows the defi
nite link between frequent hand 
washing and irritant contact 
dermatitis (or hand dermatitis) 
in health care workers.
The study was presented 
at the 66th Annual Meeting 
of the American Academy of 
Dermatology.
While good hand hygiene is 
important, Dr. Nedorost rec
ommends substituting alcoholbased cleaners for hand wash
ing whenever appropriate. Also, 
creamor ointment-based emol
lients should be applied to the 
skin immediately after hand 
washing, to prevent the rapid 
drying and cracking of skin.

Health Talk: Frostbite
SHALEYA SOLOMON
Staffwriter
During the cold winter 
months, frozen extremities are 
fairly common occurrences. Low 
temperatures and biting winds 
cause extreme discomfort and 
can be painful. Many people ex
perience frostbite at some point 
during their lives, if not dur
ing their college career in Pitts
burgh. However, frostbite, if not 
taken seriously, can have severe 
consequences.
Frostbite occurs when layers of 
skin freeze when the tissues are 
exposed to a climate that is below 
the freezing point of skin, which 
is approximately -15 degrees 
Celsius, or 5 degrees Fahrenheit. 
The brain then sends messages 
to the vessels that supply blood 
to the tissues of the nose, fingers, 
toes, and ears (or wherever the 
frostbite is occurring), telling 
them to constrict. This in turn 
\
causes a decrease in blood flow to 
the affected extremities. Blood, 
though, is vital in keeping body 
parts warm. Therefore, if there is 
less blood flowing to extremities, 
then more blood is available for 
vital organs, keeping them warm 
instead, and leaving the extremi
ties to freeze.
Frostbite due to prolonged 
exposure to extreme weather 
conditions can cause necrosis, 
or death of cells. There are two 
ways in which this can occur. 
The first is when necrosis occurs 
upon immediate exposure, due 
to the formation of ice crystals in 
the space surrounding the cells. 
This loss of water causes osmo
sis from the inside of the cell 
outwards. The dehydration of 
cells subsequently results in cell 
death. The second way necrosis 
happens is when damaged blood 
vessels result in the inflamma
tion of tissues. This also causes a 
lack of oxygen in the tissues, and
once again, cell death. -
Superficial frostbite is a com
monplace affliction. Symptoms 
include itching, burning, redness, 
and numbness in the affected ar
eas. Deep frostbite is noted by 
blisters over whitened, frozen 
skin; the skin appears waxy and 
turns almost purple in color as it 
warms up. In addition, the skin 
remains hard and sometimes can 
appear blackened and dead.
Pain is also a symptom of 
frostbite, especially when blood 
returns to the affected areas. 
Moreover, frostbite can set in 
over time. That is, tissues may 
initially appear healthy and un
affected, but symptoms can ap
pear much later, even as long as 
one to two days.
Frostbite frequently occurs in 
alcoholics, drug addicts, and peo
ple suffering from mental illness, 
because many of these individu
als are often dehydrated or suffer 
from decreased blood flow. Men
S
aged 30 to 49 are also very sus
ceptible, as are people with bad 
circulation and diseases such as 
diabetes.
However, it is fairly easy to 
prevent frostbite. Its important 
to keep the body covered and 
try to avoid prolonged exposure 
to extreme temperatures: Wear 
gloves, a scarf, and especially 
a hat, since 30 to 50 percent of 
heat lost is through the head. 
Also, keeping the body dry is cru
cial; as such, wearing fabrics that 
keep moisture away from skin is 
a must. Wearing loose layers is 
the best idea; impeded blood 
flow due to tight clothes can in
crease susceptibility to frostbite. 
Moisturizing the skin before go
ing outside can also help, as can 
hand warmers from those days 
of cheering from the bleachers at 
football games or waiting in line 
at the ice rink.

Grad student Jonathan Hurst stands next to Thumper, the robotic leg he designed that should help scientists study how the body runs.
MARIUM CHANDNA
SciTech Editor
As we race toward a futuristic 
era in which robots may be em
ployed in fire departments and 
hospitals, not to mention their re
cent entry into the corporate and 
domestic spheres, it would not be 
surprising to see something akin 
to the Transformers pacing our 
campus some day.
Carnegie Mellon graduate stu
dent Jonathan Hurst has already 
kicked off the probable legacy; 
Hurst designed a gigantic robot 
leg prototype that is an interest
ing amalgamation of software 
from the RHex project  a plan 
to develop a six-legged robot that 
will walk, run, and even climb 
stairs  with springs that gener
ate a natural running movement. 
The software applied includes 
the QNX real-time operating sys
tem, which allows one to assess 
what computerized actions will 
take place and when. Further
more, its prioritizing of tasks 
deems QNX the ideal operating 
system for Hursts invention.
Hurst said that the motive be
hind this innovation is to learn 
about the dynamic mechanism 
of running through robotic mo
tion.
Seeing a robot run on rough 
terrains is [something] yet to be 
explored, Hurst said.
Popularly known as the Elec
trical Cable Differential (ECD)
Leg in the Robotics Institute, 
Hursts latest project is designed 
to study the role of compliance in 
running.
While a conventional robot is 
made up of mechanical compo
nents, electrical hardware, and 
computer software, the rigidity 
of this system and sole control 
through software do not allow 
for the bouncing movements that 
are produced by running, Hurst 
said.
For example, a rotating gear 
motor  a typical component of 
the traditional robot  fails to 
generate leaping running move
ments. Similarly, a pneumatic 
actuator that converts potential 
energy into motion is often hard 
to control. Therefore, this stan
dard operation cannot possibly 
determine the rate and motion of 
running.
Keeping this in mind, Hurst 
used large fiberglass springs and 
a series of cables, along with spe
cially designed software, to un
derstand the natural dynamics 
of running. In Hursts prototype, 
electric motors are attached to 
the leg joints using steel cables.
The steel cables enfold alumi
num pulleys, which work with 
them in unison to produce the 
desired effect. Hurst tested his 
prototype by creating a computer 
simulation of the robot leg that 
illustrates the precise running 
movements of the robot.
The simulation uses the same
graphical interface and same 
software controllers that are 
used to design the prototype, 
Hurst said.
Down the line, the ECD leg can 
also be used to explore software 
control methods for biomechanically inspired running gaits, he 
said.
In the human leg, the fiberglass 
springs are analogous to tendons 
or sinews, which link the muscle 
to bone. The contraction of an
tagonistic muscles (muscles that 
counteract each others move
ments) is a possible example of 
how the human body makes ad
justments similar to the springs.
One potential use of the 
knowledge we hope to gain from 
this machine is to build exoskele
tons and prosthetic limbs, Hurst 
stated in an e-mail.
So far, wearable exoskeletons 
(similar to those designed for 
military use) have used large, 
high-energy actuators that ex
ercise total control over the 
wearers movements. As a result, 
the exoskeletons turn out to be 
larger than needed, and not use
ful enough to achieve their maxi
mum potential. In the case of 
military application, the exoskel
etons are used to help soldiers 
carry heavier loads while travel
ing long distances.
Exoskeletons to assist people 
with limited mobility is another 
upcoming application; some 
people who are currently wheel
chair-bound may be able to walk 
with a relatively low-power assis
tive device, Hurst stated.
Yet, the kinetics of running 
need to be fully understood in or
der to construct robotic exoskel
etons that adapt to the natural 
running motion.
By understanding the funda
mentals of locomotion, exoskel
etons could be designed to work 
closely with the dynamics of a 
specific persons gait, assisting 
their movement, with relatively 
low power required to reduce the 
metabolic cost of the wearer, 
Hurst stated. I do not believe 
we are limited by the strength or 
speed of motors, only by our un
derstanding of the gait.
According to a Carnegie Mel
lon press release, Hurst works 
jointly with University of Michi
gan professor Jessy Grizzle, 
who received a National Science 
Foundation grant to study con
trol methods for legged locomo
tion.
Thumper, one of the two ro
bots that are equipped with ECD 
legs, is currently set up in the 
Robotics Institute. A single ro
bot leg, Thumper will be used 
to investigate the role of compli
ance in running. The other ro
bot, MABEL, stands in Grizzles 
laboratory at the University of 
Michigan, and will be used to 
investigate the concept of control 
in legged locomotion.

CIT professor Ed Rubin wins Nobel Prize for Peace
How Things Work: Speech Recognition
stated in a Carnegie Mellon press 
release.
There are many solutions that 
can be adopted for mitigating 
climate change. These involve 
using energy more efficiently, 
using energy sources with low 
or no carbon emission (like 
wind and solar energy, in addi
tion to other renewable energy 
sources), capturing C02 from 
large industrial sources and se
questering it deep underground, 
reducing deforestation, and a 
host of other measures to reduce 
non-C02 greenhouse gas emis
sions from agriculture and other 
activities.
According to Rubin, using 
energy more efficiently is some
thing that every individual can 
and should be able to do easily. 
Rubin believes that governments 
around the globe have major po
tential to change the fate of the 
environment in terms of climate 
change.
This is a classic role of gov
ernment  which boils down to 
the people you and I elect to rep
resent our common interests, 
Rubin stated. But individuals, 
companies, and non-govern
mental organizations also can be 
major forces for change.
The technology on which 
[Rubin] has been working, like 
the clean coal combustion tech
nology and the carbon capture 
sequestration, are important 
technologies as we transition 
from dirty coal to clean coal, 
Dzombak said. The transition 
will take around 100 years to 
evolve from the fossil fuel age 
to the renewable energy source 
age.
Climate change is something 
that will affect all countries. 
Rubin suspects that the poorer 
countries of the world are the 
most likely to suffer most, but he 
does not deny the fact that poten
tial reverberations are global.
One crucial task is the devel
opment of new technologies.
Innovation is basically learn
ing how to do things better, Mc
Coy said. With time, we learn 
how to make things better and 
more cheaply, more reliably. 
This is the kind of work [Rubin] 
has been doing.
Today no one has built a 
power plant that has carbon cap
ture storage, but we have many 
good analogies to think about 
the capture systems, he added. 
We have models. We are trying 
to estimate how much cheaper 
these technologies can be and 
when.
Rubin hopes to raise public 
awareness. The first step is to 
get more informed, then get in
volved, he stated. There are lots 
of resources on the Web to help 
get people started, including en
vironmental organizations like 
the Natural Resources Defense 
Council (www.nrdc.org).
Rubin is among 16 Nobel lau
reates currently at Carnegie Mel
lon and is the first faculty mem
ber to share the Nobel Peace 
Prize.
phonemes  short pulses of sound that 
characterize the shortest elements of 
language we vocalize. For example, the 
word cat is constructed out of three 
phonemes: k, a, and t. The broken-up 
voice file is then analyzed and each phoneme 
is identified  or, more commonly, several 
possible candidates are identified.
Next, the computer in the voice 
recognition device must search through its 
entire database of words (which may range 
from a mere handful in simpler applications 
to literally millions in advanced dictation 
programs), attempting to recognize the 
appropriate word spoken.
Obviously, this is far from a trivial task: 
Given the uncertainty on each phoneme, 
differences in dialect, speed of talking, and 
run-on words that may be hard to separate, 
hundreds of words may seem to fit the 
digitized input.
For a smaller voice recognition computer, 
which only needs to receive simple input 
such as numbers or specific directions, 
the process ends here. If the input is a 
positive match for something within its 
library, or at least a close approximation, 
the appropriate command is chosen and 
executed. Otherwise, the computer simply 
rejects the input and asks the user to reissue 
the command.
For larger dictation programs, though, 
the work has only just begun. The sheer 
ambiguity of language, while perhaps 
second nature to human speakers, is a hard 
taskto quantify within hard-coded computer 
language. These programs must maintain 
gigantic libraries of information on how 
words and phonemes relate to one another, 
including the statistical probabilities that 
any given word may be preceded or followed
Frostbite
HEALTH TALK, fromA5
Mild cases of frostbite can be 
treated from home. Gradually in
creasing body temperature will 
help to reduce tissue damage and 
pain, and affected areas should be 
elevated in order to prevent or re
duce swelling. Consuming warm, 
non-alcoholic, non-caffeinated 
fluids can also help to raise body 
temperature and decrease dehy
dration. Importantly, do not run 
cold extremities under hot water. 
If there is a chance that frozen ex
tremities will become cold again, 
do not thaw them in between these 
time periods; increased fluctua
tion in tissue temperature raises 
the likelihood of damaging those 
tissues. Additionally, rubbing af
fected areas increases friction and 
can cause more tissue damage  
so resist doing so if you can.
As cold weather in Pittsburgh 
usually persists into mid-April, 
make sure to exercise caution 
when going outside. If you are go
ing to be outside for a long time 
(for example, for Buggy or other 
sports), make sure to wear lay
ers and invest in hand warmers. 
Frostbite is incredibly uncomfort
able, and you dont need yet an
other reason to not be able to do 
your homework.

Professor Ed Rubin of the en
gineering and public policy and 
mechanical engineering de
partments of Carnegie Mellon 
is among the recipients of the 
Nobel Peace Prize award that 
was presented to the UN Inter
governmental Panel of Climate 
Change (IPCC) and Al Gore in 
December 2007.
It is a fantastic accomplish
ment, said Dave Dzombak, CIT 
associate dean and a colleague 
of Rubins. He is the first faculty 
member and alum to be affili
ated by the Nobel Peace Prize to 
my knowledge.
The IPCC was established 20 
years ago to address the causes 
of climate change, its environ
mental and socio-economic con
sequences, as well as adaptation 
and mitigation options that re
spond to it. In an e-mail, Rubin 
stated, The award will lend 
additional prestige to an orga
nization that is already widely 
respected.
Rubin was invited five years 
ago to be a lead author on a spe
cial report dealing with carbon 
dioxide capture and storage. The 
report was completed at the end 
of 2005. It was a major contri
bution to the understanding of 
technical options to control C02 
emissions.
The research is focused on 
identifying the technical options 
and costs of reducing emissions 
from large industrial sources, 
especially power plants. Rubin 
and his group also study the pro
cess of technological innovation 
to estimate how environmen
tal issues might evolve in the 
future.
Carbon dioxide from power 
plants is taken and separated, 
said Sean McCoy, a Ph.D. stu
dent at Carnegie Mellon who 
was involved in the research 
with Rubin. Then you transport 
it and sequester it, store it un
derground, he said. The cost is 
quite reasonable, around $5 per 
ton of C02 stored.
Dzombak attributed part of 
Rubins success to the interdisci
plinary research culture at Carn
egie Mellon.
It made it easy for [Rubin] 
to interact with a variety of en
gineers, process modelers, and 
people who work [in] decision 
making, Dzombak said.
Rubin was able to integrate as
pects of science and engineering 
to address large-scale technol
ogy issues. He, his students, and 
his post-docs have worked for 
years to develop integrated mod
els for the entire process.
Our work in the IPCC, and 
our research here at Carnegie 
Mellon, show that there are vi
able solutions to address the 
climate change problem  solu
tions that are not only good for 
the environment, but also good 
for the economy and for national 
security. The key challenge now 
is to get on with the job, Rubin

by any other given word in the language.
The computer must then individually 
evaluate every single one of these 
possibilities before arriving at a sentence 
that approximates what was spoken. The 
possibilities are staggering  given a 
short sentence of 10 words and perhaps 30 
phonemes, literally hundreds of different 
sentences may present themselves; given 
that todays computers are as yet incapable 
of actually understanding what is being 
spoken, its quite a miracle that speech 
recognition programs work at all.
Homophones, or words that sound the 
same, are yet another giant obstacle for 
voice recognition. For example, there 
and their or hair, air, and heir, are 
all words that sound very similar but have 
quite different meanings. Once again, the 
statistical correlation of words is the only 
way a machine can hope to decode what is 
actually being said.
One practical application of speech 
recognition that is rapidly gaining notice, 
interestingly, is for automatic prescription 
dictation in medical institutes.
All jibes at doctors handwriting aside, 
automatic dictation will no doubt relieve 
many pharmacists of their fear of giving out 
mistaken prescriptions. Whether or not the 
lives of human beings can be entrusted to asyet unreliable speech recognition programs 
is yet a matter of debate.
One of the most well-known companies in 
voice recognition technology, Voicesignal, 
touts that it makes recognition programs for 
over 21 different languages; one can only 
hope that it is but a matter of time before 
the day when C-3POs fluency in 8 million 
different forms of galactic communication 
becomes the standard.

Any sufficiently advanced technology is 
indistinguishable from magic, said Arthur 
C. Clarke, renowned science fiction author 
of the 20th century  and even today, we 
see the truth of this statement everywhere 
before our eyes.
Open Sesame! chanted Aladdin to 
open the treasure cavern of Ali Baba and 
the 40 Thieves. Today, we deal with much 
the same in our daily lives  from phones 
that dial numbers at the sound of a name, 
to automated voice-menus in various phone 
services, voice recognition is a little bit of 
magic that technology has introduced into 
our lives.
Voice recognition, however, is a far more 
tricky business than it sounds. If even 
real-life, human students have trouble 
understanding professors thick accents, 
what hope do machines have in this regard?
They have quite a bit of hope, it would 
seem, by the increasingly widespread 
prevalence of voice-activated devices today. 
Not unlike humans, voice recognition 
programs operate on a statistical approach
 namely, they analyze what they think you 
said, and pick the most likely option.
First, the microphone records a digitized 
waveform of the speech input, which is 
immediately filtered of most frequencies 
that are outside of normal human speech 
parameters to remove static, background 
noise, and general interference. The actual 
sound digitization is perhaps the easiest part
 its the subsequent analysis that takes the 
most time.
After filtering, the computer scans the 
voice file and attempts to break it up into

Bush: Neither apologetic nor defensive
The recent crash of SIS (Student Infor
mation System) raises serious questions 
of functionality, specifically regarding 
the central role of SIS applications in 
registration and academic planning.
Considering that its in constant use, it 
would be nice if SIS and like applications 
could be heavily insured against crashes, 
but for financial reasons, the school relies 
on strong maintenance contracts to fix 
problems after they arise, instead of du
plicating its systems. Since the specialists 
who work on the problem are salaried, the 
only cost the school incurs in these types of 
meltdowns is the cost of lost productivity.
The truth of the matter is that the ap
plications are dated, the oldest parts hav
ing been introduced in the early 1990s. 
While we are hard-pressed to argue that 
SIS should adopt more comprehensive 
preventative measures against failures 
without the appropriate funds to do so, its 
still the case that even when SIS is fully 
operational, its user interface is the bane
of students registration experience.
True, if by chance you know exactly what 
courses you want and their course num
bers, there are no scheduling conflicts, you 
dont run into waitlists, and youve memo
rized all the classes youve already taken, 
SIS will breeze you through registration. If 
you are an actual student, however, youre 
probably crying into your monitor on reg
istration day with the following windows 
coldly staring back: SIO (Student Informa
tion On-Line), OLR (On-Line Registration), 
and CIO (Course Information On-Line) 
within SIS, in addition to Academic Audit, 
Schedule of Classes, the Course Catalogue, 
and an online scheduler.
When SIS came onto the market in the 
early 1990s, it was likely a cutting-edge 
technology. Today, however, the lack of 
integration between its various functions 
is appalling. That the application that tells 
you if a course is available is separate from 
the one that lets you choose that course 
for your schedule, which is in turn sepa
rate from the one that shows you a list of 
available courses, is mystifying.
The ideal system for students ease 
would be a combination between an on
line scheduler (which would allow you to 
create a schedule from courses uploaded 
from the official Schedule of Classes) 
and audit that shows you what courses 
are necessary to complete your major, 
the availability of the courses, and, the 
cherry on top: one-click registration once 
you have created your online schedule.
Yes, it would take a lot of money and 
time to develop, but it would the leader 
among applications of its kind, and lead
ership in the area of software develop
ment is not something Carnegie Mellon 
balks at. There are far more important 
projects afoot that deserve resources, of 
course, but it is a shame that the chief 
information officers staff has to spend 
hours and hours of work to repair (and 
incidentally, globalize) a system that is 
in dire need of a face-lift.

On Monday night, President Bush gave 
his eighth and final State of the Union 
address. Dressed in a blue tie, with his 
American-flag pin securely fastened, Bush 
faced Congress, distinguished guests, 
and millions of TV viewers.
This was my first time watching a 
State of the Union address. I didnt know 
what to expect. How would Bush pres
ent his time as president? With brutal 
honesty? With fist-pumping pride?
According to the Constitution, the 
purpose of the address is to report 
to Congress, literally, the state of the 
union, and to recommend measures the 
president thinks should be considered 
promptly. President Bush did all of this. 
He summarized the hardships America 
has faced tied to war, the economy, and 
health care, but assured us that the gov
ernments duty was to to carry out the 
peoples business, and that is exactly 
what he intended to do. There was 
alarming applause.
Then the sugarcoating began. Bush 
said that, in the long run, Americans 
should have confidence in the economy, 
but that in the short run, we can all see 
that growth is slowing. Just slowing? 
Not rapidly decreasing?
Despite Bushs optimistic words, the 
economy is in bad shape, and for the past 
six months, weve been on the brink of 
recession. The housing market is in dire 
condition (houses arent being built, 
prices are falling), the value of the dol
lar is declining every day (which means 
the cost of imports will continue to rise 
and inflation is inevitable), and banks 
are losing millions in profit as a result 
of the credit crisis. To answer the prob
lem of sluggish economic growth, Bush

Interdisciplinary study is, theoreti
cally, the backbone of this university 
(whose vertebrae are excellence in en
gineering, design, and self-exhaustion). 
But it doesnt always work out as planned.
Intellectual diversity is one of the 
biggest reasons we came to Carnegie 
Mellon. (That, and the large number of 
coffee shops within walking distance 
of campus.) The fact that students are 
given the flexibility to pursue polarized 
interests, and avoid being stuck in one 
realm of academia, is commendable.
That said, the logistical end of interdis
ciplinary study can undermine the poten
tial results of being interdisciplinary. It is 
often poorly executed on our campus.
Students with several majors are often 
stretched thin between departments that 
dont communicate with each otheror 
with students. It seems that several de
partments are unaware of (and uninter
ested in) the curricula of other colleges. If 
a design major thinks psychology would 
help her better understand the clients for 
whom she will one day design products, 
shouldnt she be able to combine the two 
without worrying how to balance CFA 
design critiques and H&SS exams?
While students in multiple fields of 
study are often inherently independent 
and self-motivated, they shouldnt be 
forced to be so as a result of neglectful 
advisers, instructors, and fellow students.
For example, as a BHA student, one of 
us is in two departments that do not inter
act with each other. The CFA department 
doesnt account for the challenge of spread
ing ones creativity between writing novel 
papers and creating flawless drawings. 
Similarly, the H&SS department dismisses 
design classes as academically inferior and 
as more of a hobby than real work.
urged a bill to stimulate the economy: 
tax rebates for families and tax cuts for 
businesses to encourage investment. Is 
this enough to avoid recession?
Bush then vehemently reminded us 
that the fight against terrorism, against 
the evil men of al Qaeda, is not over. 
This prefaced his ever-strong praise for 
the war efforts in Iraq, and particularly 
for the surge in troops executed last year.
I dont claim to be a war strategist, but 
what weve accomplished in Iraq is little 
compared to what weve lost  thou
sands of lives and a significant amount of 
respect from other nations. And how can 
we ignore his basis for entering in the first 
place  the misguided argument that 
there were weapons of mass destruction? 
The tyranny of Saddam ended as did the 
threat of WMDs, and while it has been a 
long war, we havent forgotten.
Bushs overall tone was neither apolo
getic nor outwardly defensive, although 
his approval rating is the lowest in his
tory at 31 percent. Really, his speech was 
rather dull. He stated the accomplish
ments of his presidency as if there had 
never been any controversy surround
ing them. He talked about his support 
of Americas effort to increase ethical 
scientific research, to bring democracy 
to countries that want and need it, and 
to pass laws to reduce oil usage.
I can see why people would feel an
noyed that he had the nerve to praise 
policies that have failed or came too 
little, too late. But what can we expect 
from Bush right now? His time as presi
dent isnt over. With a year left in office, 
hes going to support what hes brought 
to the table. After all, hes always been 
a man who sticks by his word, for better 
or for worse.
Justine Lee (jrlee@) is a senior in profes
sional writing and business administra
tion. She needs help decidingwho she wants 
to be the next president, any suggestions?
students ignored
This isnt the responsibility of depart
ments themselves. Advisers of interdis
ciplinary students should act as. their 
agents, fighting for the students they 
represent. However, all departments, no 
matter the college, should be respectful 
of (and, perhaps crazily, even intrigued 
by) students with diverse interests. Never 
should a person doubling in drama and 
history feel at odds with his peers in ei
ther field, nor should he regret attempting 
to balance multiple interests.
Its possible to successfully unite dif
ferent disciplines. The BHA and BSA 
programs provide students with direc
tion (students must explain why two 
fields of study are relatable as part of 
the programs). Also, in MCS, it is rou
tine to unite two majors into one  bi
ology and chemistry into biochemistry, 
for example. SHS, a program that many 
students begin as first-years, also allows 
for dual study between H&SS and MCS.
H&SS has been successful in combin
ing disciplines into new majors, such as 
ethics, history and public policy, and the 
linguistics major. Why are these pro
grams successful? Because they have 
strong administrators and faculty who 
work with students, not against them.
Carnegie Mellon is home to students 
with big dreams and big plans. Students 
academic wishes cant go anywhere with
out the support of administration and 
faculty. Interdisciplinary study can only 
function if colleges realize that students 
themselves are as unique as the programs 
offered. Deans, department heads, and 
advisers must make a commitment to 
help students break down walls between 
colleges, prerequisites, and core require
ments to discover what they can do at Car
negie Mellon, not what they cant.
Jessica Thurston (jthursto@) and Claire 
Morgenstern (cmorgens@J are juniors 
with too many majors between them to 
count.

Beyond Mars: Space exploration should focus on icy moons
SHEILA PRAKASH
Mars is exciting  so much so 
that it is taking all of my willpow
er to avoid slipping into a coma.
Forty-six years ago, Mars was 
thought to harbor Martians.
Martians are exciting.
Several days ago, NASA revealed 
breaking news that the Woman on 
Mars, (a widely circulating image 
sent back from the latest Mars 
explorer that looks like a naked 
woman, or Bigfoot, or both) is not a 
Martian. It is a rock formation. The 
image does show, however, that the 
surface of Mars is still red. This is 
exciting (and relieving!), because 
Mars could have turned zucchini 
green since the last time we saw it.
Every year, NASA budgets mil
lions of dollars toward the explo
ration of a planet that is barren 
and lifeless (and boring). Mars 
captivated the publics imagina
tion in its glory days, when Viking 
1 captured a picture of Cydonia 
Mensae, a region of Mars that 
looked remarkably like a human 
face. The Face on Mars sparked 
a public frenzy about space civili
zations, space travel, and aliens.
That was 1976.
Since then, 16 Mars missions 
have revealed more or less the same 
thing: Mars is dead. Still, Mars 
continues to dominate the media. 
Mainstream news articles on plan
etary science flip-flop between two 
topics: intriguing potential find
ings of water and semi-earth-like 
atmospheres on extrasolar planets 
(like HD209458b, which is a night
mare to pronounce and hundreds 
of light-years away, but fascinating 
nonetheless)  and Mars.
Given the medias misrepresen
tation of the universe (and NASAs 
countless expeditions in Mars name), 
its no wonder that we, the public; feel 
obligated to care about Mars. Tlirning 
ones back on Mars has become 
tantamount to shunning space explo
ration altogether. In erudite circles, 
a public renunciation of Mars deems 
you a neophyte, an uneducated sim
pleton that doesnt care about sweep
ing metaphysical questions like where 
we came from, and whether life exists 
on other planets.
I proudly include myself in 
this categoiy of neer-do-wellers, 
because I do not care about Mars. 
Bodies with deep hydrothermal 
vents, spectacular subsurface 
oceans, and violent volcanoes  
bodies touted again and again by 
scientists as having the highest 
potential for extraterrestrial life
 exist in our own backyard.
They deserve some attention.
Somewhere in the universe, 
there is a loud crack. A hydrother
mal plume has just exploded from 
an ocean 200 kilometers deep and 
bubbled its way up to greet a thick 
sheet of ice. The sheet writhes 
and melts as the pressure from 
the rising diapir (in geology, a 
swelling caused by shifts beneath 
the surface) melts away portions 
of its underbelly. The upwelling 
plume struggles to break through 
the ice, but the sheet is too thick. 
The plume bubbles once more 
before subsiding back to the ocean 
floor. It will erupt again. Europa, 
Jupiters sixth moon, is restless.
Europas subsurface ocean, a 
potential bastion of extraterres
trial life, is one of the best-kept 
secrets in our solar system. Still, 
the media continue to point their 
lenses at Mars, and this spectacu
lar satellite goes largely unnoticed.
Nearby, Ganymede  Jupiters 
largest moon  is awoken by the 
disturbance. The visually arrest
ing Ganymede lumbers behind 
Europa, making the two satel
lites frequently criss-crossing 
neighbors. Ganymedes surface 
is pockmarked and striated. 
The striations are the potential 
grumblings of a salty, subsurface 
ocean. A simulated flyover of
Ganymede reveals Arbela Sulcus, 
a groove that dramatically slices 
through Ganymede, indicating 
water movement below.
There have been initiatives to 
explore Jupiters satellites. The 
Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer, for 
example, was proposed to explore 
these moons in greater detail, 
although a change in priorities 
at NASA to manned-missions 
(Mars was, no doubt, on the bill) 
caused the project to lose fund
ing in 2005. Another project, the 
Europa IcePick Ocean Explorer, 
was a grassroots scientific effort 
spearheaded by Larry Klaes, 
of the Columbus Optical SETI 
Observatory, to build a hydrobot 
to penetrate Europas ice crust 
and explore the ocean below. The 
project lost steam, due in part to 
a lack of public awareness.
Travelingfrom Jupiterto Saturn 
yields another treasure. Titan, 
Saturns 12th and largest moon, 
is so rich in organic compounds 
that it is one of the frontrunners 
in the search for microbial life 
in the universe. It is also heav
ily looked at to answer questions 
about prebiotic chemistry, such 
as the origins of nucleotides (the 
building blocks of DNA) and pro
teins. The conditions on Titan 
are almost identical to the condi
tions on early Earth  conditions
that eventually gave rise to life. 
As expected, Titan receives pal
try funding when compared to 
Mars and is largely ignored by 
the mainstream media.
Mars will forever be respon
sible for ushering a wave of 
enthusiasm and awareness 
about astrobiology, astrochemistry, and the possibility of life on 
other planets  and for that, it 
warrants a well-deserved place 
in the publics fancy. But for all 
its merits, NASAs outright shun
ning of Europa, Ganymede, 
Titan, and most recently Saturns 
sixth moon Enceladus  whose 
Europa-like geology is quietly 
generating excitement  is irre
sponsible. The public deserves to 
know that Mars is not the most 
interesting body in our solar sys
tem. And at that point, the public 
may also discern what is the more 
important endeavor for mankind: 
throwing money at a dead planet 
in the hopes of one day colonizing 
it, or discovering untold secrets 
about ourselves and the universe 
by looking for life where it most 
likely exists  the icy moons.
Sheila Prakash (sheilap(a>) is a 
senior biology major willing to 
look anywhere for signs of life.

Figure skating needs new personalities, more coverage
CYNTHIA PENG
Michelle Kwan, we need you.
Americas athletic idol, having 
retired from competitive figure 
skating two years ago, left an 
immense legacy: two Olympic 
medals and nine national cham
pionships, not to mention her 
grace, style, and beauty. She 
also left a huge void to be filled: 
that of being a spokesperson of 
a sport America used to adore, 
one who extended its popularity 
beyond figure skatings narrow 
world, as well as one who could 
captivate audiences with her onice and off-ice warmth. The void 
was as apparent as ever in this 
past months U.S. Figure Skating 
Championships, when spectator 
turnout was at a low.
For figure skating to survive, 
someone needs to step into 
Michelle Kwans shoes. Those 
shoes, presumably with blades 
attached, are big ones to fill.
Back in the day, figure skating 
could compete with pro football 
(in our living rooms). The 1980s 
and 1990s were the golden age 
of figure skating, at least in the 
U.S. Our athletes won Olympic 
medals, pushed the envelope 
athletically and artistically, and 
caused enough controversy to 
remain in the interest of the 
general public, all while in 
sequins.
Today, that golden age is over.
The sign of an imminent 
downfall came this year when 
ABC, which had been broad
casting figure skating since the 
early days of television coverage, 
didnt renew its $12 million con
tract with the U.S Figure Skating 
Association. ABC and other title 
sponsors had their qualms; for a 
number of reasons, figure skat
ings popularity was dying. Heres
why.
Arguably, it all started with the 
French judge. Remember her? 
She was the redhead in the fur 
coat who took a bribe to vote 
the Russians over the Canadians 
in the pairs event in the 2002 
Olympics. A significant amount 
of tears, trials, tribulations, and 
Russian mafia associations later, 
her most lasting impact was the 
abandonment of the judging sys
tem we have known and loved 
for so long.' The International 
Skating Union took about two 
years to experiment with new 
systems, ones that are arguably 
fairer to the skater and less prone 
to outside influences pressuring
judges.
Today, the head-scratching set 
of numbers that pops up onto 
the screen is the abstruse sys
tem known as the Code of Points. 
Skaters are awarded points 
based on the difficulty of the 
element and the quality of its 
execution, along with points for 
artistic presentation. This con
fusing system has lost the emo
tional excitement of the 6.0, a 
dramatic mark of perfection only 
figure skating could produce. To 
the average viewer, the Code of 
Points has no basis, no mark of 
value.
In addition, the Code of 
Points inspires skaters to make
Michael Menchaca/Art Staff
their programs so jam-packed 
with eye-catching elements 
that some feel that the beau
ty of natural lines and simple 
elegance is gone. Skating has 
turned into gymnastics on ice. 
The younger and more limber 
you are, the better your chances 
of succeeding. This years win
ning ladies were aged 14, 15, 
and 16, respectively. Kimmie 
Meissner, the 2006 World 
Champion and a college fresh
man this year, was a veteran in 
the field at age 18.
Undeniably, skating has lost its 
star power. With Michelle Kwan, 
Sasha Cohen, and others removed 
from the competitive circuit since
the 2006 Olympics, there lacks 
a charismatic personality in an 
America whose media coverage 
of athletes is personality driven. 
Michelle and Sasha were ice 
queens; they sparkled in $5000 
Vera Wang dresses, chatted up 
Jay Leno, rode on parade floats, 
and skated to the best music
 Ravel, Rachmaninoff, Romeo 
and Juliet, Tosca, Swan Lake. 
Today, the ice queen has been 
replaced by the jumping bean  
young, limber, and able to pull 
off gravity-defying jumps before 
even getting his or her drivers 
license.
However, figure skatings 
future remains promising. 
Fourteen-year-old Caroline 
Zhang, who trains in the 
Kwan family rink in Artesia, 
Calif., performed a grace
ful program to Ave Maria 
at the championships  one 
that would have made the late 
Luciano Pavarotti proud. Johnny 
Weir, known for his eccentricity, 
also amused us with his frilly 
outfits and uncensored inter
views. The younger generation, 
so criticized by some, brings 
a new tone to the competitive 
scene. They may be glued to 
their cell phones and study
ing for the revamped SATs, but 
they are fresh-faced, ambitious, 
and talented enough to hope to 
make the 2010 games.
There are flaws in the system. 
The boards surrounding the rink 
at Nationals this year might indeed 
have more white space than ads 
for weight loss diets (a true loss). 
Nevertheless, I believe that figure 
skating can pull itself out of this 
slump and reemerge into a new 
golden age of popularity.
Cynthia Peng (cynthiap@J is a 
first-year Science and Humanities 
Scholar. She enjoys giving a voice 
to a forgotten sport and hopes 
that in the future, as many people 
will watch figure skating as those 
who watched the Super Bowl.

CMU5 Mystery 
Issue and new 
grading systems
Sean Weinstock & Adi Jain
Hey Carnegie Mellon,
The main objectives of the 
Weinstock/Jain administration 
this past week were the new ex
ploration of the CMU5 Mystery 
Issue (www.cmu5.com) and the 
proposed +/- grading system.
With regard to the Mystery 
Issue, we saw Evan Osheroff, 
chairman of the Senate Aca
demic Affairs Committee, and 
Guangzu Gao, a fellow commit
tee member, take tremendous 
initiative in researching our peer 
institutions policies. At MIT, 
Johns.Hopkins, and Brown, firstyear undergraduates are allowed 
a semester of pass/fail grading in 
order to adapt to the rigors of col
legiate classes and their varying 
grading scales.
As a student government, 
we feel that adopting a similar 
policy at Carnegie Mellon would 
help integrate new students into 
our educational system. With 
a little less stress, we believe 
that students would partici
pate more in organizations and 
other extracurriculars, which 
would allow Carnegie Mellon to 
develop into the well-rounded 
undergraduate experience we 
hope it can be. So far, the issue 
has been endorsed by Senators 
and myself at Senate meetings 
and the University Educational 
Council. This would be a major 
change, and we hope that you 
will give us your feedback, posi
tive or negative.
On the +/- issue, a great 
debate is underway. The last 
time I reported on this issue was 
when Faculty Senate decided 
to install a shadow grading sys
tem this semester to examine 
whether or not students QPAs 
would benefit from +/- grading. 
Since then, there has been argu
ment as to whether or not such a 
study would prove statistically 
accurate. A proposed revision 
would be to conduct a four-year 
experiment with an upcoming 
freshman class by monitoring 
whether their grades improve 
from past averages with an in
stalled +/- system. We should 
see this issue resolved by the end 
of the year.
Student Senate will host a fo
rum to debate both of the issues 
mentioned above. It will happen 
during Senates regular Thursday 
meeting in Breed Hall (Margaret 
Morrison 103) from 5 to 6:30 
p.m. Everyone on campus is free 
to come, as Senate always values 
outside participation. We want 
to enact change that will benefit 
the general student population, 
in addition to standing up for 
values that students believe in. 
The only way we can do this is if 
we hear your voices. If you want 
more information regarding 
this forum, please e-mail me at 
cmu5@cmu.edu or Senate Chair 
Jared Itkowitz at jitkowit@.

Tennis starts season off with three strong wins
MATT CAMPBELL
Copy Staff
The Carnegie Mellon tennis 
teams started off their spring 
seasons with a bang this week
end. Saturday, the fifth-ranked 
womens team routed Division
II Slippery Rock University 8-1 
and Penn State Eries Behrend 
College 9-0. Yesterday, the
14-ranked mens team defeated 
Division II Mercyhurst College 
8-1.
The womens ranking of 
number five is the highest 
ranking in program history. 
The men, at 14, are four spots 
above their program-best fin
ish of 18, achieved at the end 
of the 2006-2007 season, but 
three spots below their highest 
mid-season ranking of number 
11. Still, the coach and players 
are more focused on winning 
matches than rankings.
The number-five ranking has 
been a nice honor for the [wom
ens] team, said head coach 
Andy Girard. But it is still early 
in the season. I would say the 
ranking has given the team a lot 
of confidence. As a coach, you 
might fear that a team might 
relax once they get a high rank
ing, I feel it has motivated them 
to work even harder.
Saturday, there was no evi
dence of the women relaxing 
or plateauing at number five as 
they beat Slippery Rock, ranked 
20th in Division II. The Tartan 
women all won in straight 
sets  winning best-of-threeset matches in only two sets. 
However, Slippery Rocks num
ber-two player, Laura Handy, 
beat Carnegie Mellon first-year 
Jennifer Chui 7-6 (5), 6-2.
Senior Amy Staloch, who 
won 7-5, 7-5 at number-one 
singles against Slippery Rock,
has gained confidence from the 
high ranking.
I think the ranking adds to 
our confidence as a team, she 
said. It is definitely motivating 
us to play hard in practice. Weve 
never been this good before, so I 
dont think we feel any pressure 
to win  its just exciting.
On Saturday afternoon, Penn 
State Behrend didnt provide 
any pressure and the Tartans 
confidence was obvious in every 
serve, forehand, backhand, and 
volley the players struck past 
the beleaguered Penn State 
Behrend team. In nine singles 
and doubles matches and 15 
sets, the Carnegie Mellon play
ers won 96 out of 107 games. By 
those numbers, the Penn State 
players won 0.73 games per set.
With the victories against 
Slippery Rock and Behrend, the 
womens record moves to 3-2.
Sunday, the mens tennis
team traveled to Erie, Pa. to take 
on the Mercyhurst Lakers. The 
Tartans won eight out of nine 
matches in straight sets. The 
Lakers managed to drown one 
of the Carnegie Mellon doubles 
teams, though, 9-7. With the 
win, the Tartan men improved 
their record to 4-1.
First-year Alex Nemerov 
and sophomore Jon Spero had 
regional singles rankings of 14th 
and 20th, respectively. The dou
bles team of Nemerov and junior 
Yiran Liu was ranked 13th.
All we try to focus on is 
improving ourselves, and by 
doing that, all those other 
things like rankings, NCAAs, 
etc. take care of themselves, 
Girard said.
On Saturday and Sunday, 
the men play West Virginia 
Wesleyan and Robert Morris. 
On Sunday, the women play 
Robert Morris.

Womens basketball defeated twice at Skibo
J.W. Ramp/Photo Editor
Senior Greg Gonzalez (#34) keeps the ball in play against the Bears.
Basketball defeats Chicago at Skibo
BASKETBALL, from A12
the year. And, as junior guard 
Elliott Curtis commented, the 
victory extended beyond its wide 
margin of victory.
The leagues so strong this 
year that we knew it wasnt over 
for us when we dropped four of 
our first five games [in the UAA], 
said Curtis, who had a spec
tacular alley-oop pass to Greg 
Gonzalez to help demoralize the 
opposition. Now if we handle 
our end and catch a few breaks 
with Rochester and Wash. 
U. dropping a couple games, 
we could find ourselves play
ing for the championship when
Rochester comes to Skibo.
Its another year of parity in 
the UAA, with a number of some
what equally matched teams get
ting knocked off as the race heats 
up. On the same Sunday that saw 
Carnegie Mellon knock off the 
number-one team in the country, 
Chicago traveled to Rochester 
and won by nine, making the 
title race even closer. Now the 
UAA stands at a three-way tie, 
with Chicago, Rochester, and 
Washington up top with league 
records of 5-2. At 3-4, the 
Tartans could make another 
move toward the top when they 
travel to St. Louis and Chicago 
next weekend, hoping to stay
perfect against the teams from 
the Midwest.
Were two games back, 
Gonzalez said. And theres still a 
lot of basketball left to be played. 
If youd have told me wed be sit
ting in this position two weeks 
ago, Id have said you were crazy. 
Were real excited. We just have 
to focus on handling our own 
business and hope other things

As difficult as it was to imagine 
two weeks ago, the Tartans look 
like theyre back in full force and 
making a run at the top.
The Tartans travel to take 
on Washington University on 
Friday, Feb. 8.
Golden Age of basketball has arrived
DOUG FRICKER
Standing 64", Candace Parker 
is Superwoman. Parker, among 
the best players in womens col
lege basketball, is helping give 
her sport some long-overdue at
tention. Womens college basket
ball is showcasing some of the 
most talented female athletes 
ever to play the game. Call it the 
Golden Age of the sport.
Three perennial powerhouses 
currently sit atop the rankings, 
and each team has its sights set 
on a national championship. 
The Connecticut Huskies are 
currently undefeated at number 
one, boasting a star-studded 
roster in which the last player 
off the bench could start for over 
90 percent of Division I teams. 
At least half of the Huskies 
received the statewide title of 
Miss Basketball in high school; 
its practically a Miss America 
pageant at UConn, with Miss 
Georgia, Miss New York, Miss 
West Virginia, Miss Ohio, and 
Miss South Carolina, to name a 
few. First-year sensation Maya 
Moore was named the 2007 
Gatorade National Player of the 
Year, while sophomore team
mate Tina Charles won the 2006 
McDonalds Player of the Year.
Connecticut has more depth 
than the Pacific Ocean, which
proves huge since two starters 
have sustained injuries already 
this season. Forward Kalana 
Greene and guard Mel Thomas 
both tore the ACL in their right 
knees, and both are expected to 
miss the rest of the season. Heres 
a statistic for you: In their first 20 
games, the team has outscored 
their opponents by an average of 
35.6 points.
You cant talk about Connecti
cut womens basketball without 
talking about the program at 
the University of Tennessee. De
fending national champs, the 
Volunteers are ranked number 
two, with their only blemish be
ing an overtime loss against Stan
ford, ranked at number seven.
Tennessee player Parker, Im 
pretty confident, is the human 
form of the Greek goddess Ath
ena. Scratch that, it makes more 
sense to say that Athena is Can
dace Parker in Greek goddess 
form. But Parker is no one-woman 
show  all five Tennessee start
ers are close to averaging double 
figures. First-year Angie Bjorklund makes more shots than a 
bartender, and point guard Shan
non Bobbitt weaves through traf
fic like Charlize Theron in The 
Italian Job.
The roster aside, I tip my cap 
to the Tennessee faithful who 
are the best fans in womens col
lege basketball. Tennesseelplayed
the University of Pittsburgh in 
the NCAA tournament here last 
March, and there was more or
ange in the stands than any other 
color. Remarkably devoted, it 
seems the Tennessee fans would 
lie down on railroad tracks if 
head coach Pat Summitt were on 
a train to retirement.
Currently number three in the 
country, North Carolina contin
ues to be a top-notch program 
and will give Tennessee and 
UConn a run for their money 
come March. The Tar Heels lost 
to UConn two weeks ago and 
lost in the Final Four to Tennes
see last March  but aside from 
these games, the Tar Heels dont 
lose. The teams only other loss 
this season was against (sur
prise, surprise) Tennessee in De
cember. Post player Erlana Lar
kins is playing with a cast on her 
left hand due to a broken bone, 
but that hasnt stopped her from 
helping out her team. Rashanda 
McCants leads the team in scor
ing and LaToya Pringle is an im
pressive high-percentage shooter
 once she pops she cant stop.
Channel surfers may want to 
give these ladies a chance while 
curling up before the tube; the 
games are exciting and theyre 
gaining more airtime. Id watch 
Tennessee play UConn over most 
other sporting events in a heart
beat. ^
players. The Tartans had trouble 
making baskets in the second 
half, shooting only 22 percent 
from the field, although a layup 
from senior forward Leah Feola 
narrowed the score to 62-44 
with 12:02 left in the game. The 
Maroons hit 11 straight points to 
rebuild their lead to 29 with 8:03 
remaining, and Chicago led by 
as much as 34 before eventually 
winning by 31.
Normally you go into a 
game thinking you have to stop 
one or two players, and with 
Chicago you have to stop them 
all because theyre all equally 
talented, said junior forward 
Rachelle Roll. When they have 
five fresh players coming in off 
the bench who are as equally 
talented, it gets tough. With us 
being limited, were working 
hard against their starters, but 
then the second five enter the 
game fresh and we have to try... 
equally hard against them.
Light finished with a 
season-high 18 points, leading 
Carnegie Mellon. Junior point 
guard Stacie Aleski added 16 
points (off of four three-point
ers) and five assists in the loss. 
Roll led the Tartans with nine 
rebounds. Chicago shot 55.4 
percent from the field for the
game, whereas the Tartans 
ended at 30.4 percent.
Baskets were scarce for both 
teams in the first half of the 
game against the Wash. U. Bears 
on Sunday, as both teams shot 
under 30 percent in the first 20 
minutes. Washington started 
2-17 from the field, and the 
Tartans worked up to an 11-5 
lead at the 9:46 mark. The 
Bears regained the lead with an 
additional five points, though 
Carnegie Mellon junior guard 
Meghan Macguire dropped in a 
three-pointer with 14 seconds 
left in the half to reduce the 
Tartans halftime deficit to four, 
trailing 24-20.
Washington regained a double
digit lead by scoring the first six 
points of the second half. The 
Tartans strung together an 8-2 
run to pull to within six (45-39) 
at the 4:20 mark. Junior forward 
Jeanette Schilling sandwiched a 
layup in between two of sopho
more guard Paige Williamsons 
three-pointers. The Bears, 
however, scored seven straight 
to lead by 13 with 1:52 remain
ing. Williamson and Aleski each 
hit a three-pointer down the 
stretch, with Aleskis coming at 
the buzzer. The Tartans ended 
down seven, 54-47.
Today was a really good 
effort, Roll said on Sunday. 
Chicago was one of the better 
teams we faced, and after the 
hard loss to them on Friday, to 
come in here, with Washington 
equally tough, and to only lose 
by single digits was pretty good. 
Its getting better and we have 
a lot to work on, but in terms of 
chemistry, hustle, and defense, 
today was quite an improvement 
over the rest of the season. They 
average 70 points a game, and to 
hold them to well beneath that 
today was a good accomplish
ment for our defense. 
Williamsons three
three-pointers propelled her to a 
team-high 11 points, and Aleski 
and Schilling chipped in with 10 
points apiece. Roll led the team 
with 11 rebounds, and Feola 
scored nine points and corralled
10 rebounds in the loss.
Every game is a fight, there 
are no easy wins in the UAA, 
Aleski said. We are just trying 
to grow and improve. You can 
never look ahead; you have to 
take it one game at a time. Focus 
on one game and hope for the 
best. Its a struggle all the way 
through.
The Tartans take on Wash. U. 
again away on Friday.

The University of Chicago 
Maroons and Washington 
(Mo.) University Bears came to 
Pittsburgh this past weekend, 
with the Carnegie Mellon 
womens basketball team 
winding up on the losing end 
of both games. The Maroons 
defeated the Tartans 84-53 
Friday night, and the Bears 
edged the Tartans 54-47 Sunday 
afternoon. Carnegie Mellon 
now stands at 7-11 overall and 
0-7 in the University Athletic 
Association (UAA).
On Friday, Chicago got out to 
a 17-2 lead five minutes into the 
game before the Tartans went on 
a 16-4 run, cutting the deficit to 
21-18 midway through the first 
half. Junior guard Colleen Light 
scored seven points, including 
a three-pointer, during the 
offensive surge. Chicago scored 
the next 13 points, however,

The Carnegie Mellon 
womens swimming and diving 
team hosted and won an 
invitational on Friday, Feb. 
1 with California University 
of Pennsylvania, Lock Haven 
University, Slippery Rock 
University, and Youngstown 
State University in attendance, 
scoring 592 points.
The mens teams ventured 
deep into Oakland to attend 
the University of Pittsburgh 
Invitational competing against 
Clarion, Denison, and Duquesne 
universities and the University 
of Pittsburgh. Carnegie Mellon 
finished ahead of Clarion and 
Duquesne but narrowly missed 
beating Denison after the last 
relay was disqualified due to a 
false start.
The Tartans were off to a good 
start when the womens relay 
team of first-years Molly Evans 
and Brianne Burton, sophomore 
Sara Andrews, and senior Lauren 
Connell won the 200-yard 
Medley Relay in 1:52.14. Senior 
co-captain Xiao-Lan Wong fin
ished third in the 1000-yard
freestyle in a time of 11:07.92.
Its my last year of competitive 
swimming, so I might as well go 
all out, Xiao said, after being 
asked to what she attributes her 
success.
Evans placed second in 
the 200-yard free in a time of 
1:54.47. The 100-yard breast
stroke proved to be a strong 
event for Carnegie Mellon with 
Andrews coming in first with 
a time of 1:09.75 and junior 
Allison Retotar taking fourth in 
1:12.80.
Even more impressive, 
the Tartans went one-two in 
the 200-yard butterfly with 
first-year Rebecca Ussai in 
first and senior co-captain 
Anna Kochalko in second with 
times of 2:12.84 and 2:14.52, 
respectively. Connell won the 
50-yard freestyle in a season best 
time of 24.82 followed by Burton 
in sixth with a time of 25.49.
Evans picked up more points 
for the team in the 100-yard 
freestyle with a third place 
finish in 54.76. Junior Colleen 
Murphy earned points for her 
2:21.19 swim in the 200-yard 
backstroke.
The team showed its strength
in the 200-yard breaststroke 
getting first, second, and fourth 
finishes led by Andrews with 
a season-best time of 2:32.23, 
followed by Kochalko with 
2:34.34, and Retotar close 
behind in 2:34.71. The 500-yard 
freestyle boasted fourth-, fifth-, 
and sixth-place finishes for 
the Tartan swimmers Connell, 
Wong, and junior Tina Daup with 
times of 5:28.69, 5:30.10, and 
5:34.58, respectively.
In the first one, two, three 
sweep of the day, Evans, Ussai, 
and first-year Lauren Gumbel 
finished in 59.48, 1:01.10, and 
1:02.1, respectively.
We knew it was going to be 
a close meet, and we knew we 
would have to swim well to win, 
but the main reason we won 
was because of the depth of our 
team, Kochalko said. In the 
200-yard IM, Kochalko finished 
second in a season-best time of 
2:20.65.
The mens team showed well 
with junior Tom McConnell 
dropping 14 seconds to place 
first in the 1000-yard freestyle in 
a career-best time of 9:39.24. He 
also placed third in the 500-yard 
freestyle in a time of 4:43.79.
First-year Frank Olechnowicz 
came in third in the 1000-yard 
freestyle with his season-best 
time of 9:27.70.
With a third-place finish in 
the 100-yard backstroke and 
a fourth-place in the 200-yard 
backstroke, first-year Michael 
Panzitta had season-best times 
in both events with 53.35 and 
1:57.29, respectively. Another 
impressive 200-yard backstroke 
swim was by first-year Alex 
Hanson in his fifth-place finish 
in 1:58.14.
Sophomore Jason Huber 
helped the team win points in 
the 100-yard breaststroke by 
placing third in 59.89. Showing 
great depth, the Tartans earned 
fourth and fifth in the 200-yard 
butterfly with first-year Justin 
Whaley in a career-best time of 
1:56.98 and senior Dave Mohney 
in a season-best of 1:59.36. 
Seniors Michael Bailey placed 
fourth in the 100-freestyle in 
47.78 and Patrick Snyder finished 
fifth with a time of 21.77.
The mens and womens teams 
will host a time trial on Saturday. 
They will next compete at the 
University Athletic Association 
Championships Feb. 20.

Basketball is a game of runs. 
Fortunately for Carnegie Mellon, 
every run wentthe teams way dur
ing a crucial University Athletic 
Association (UAA) weekend in 
Skibo Gymnasium. The Tartans 
got right back into the league 
title mix by knocking off the 
University of Chicago Maroons 
Friday night and upsetting the 
Washington University (Mo.) 
Bears on Sunday. Washington 
was ranked number one in the 
country entering Sundays game.
Carnegie Mellon got superior 
play out of its team leaders all 
weekend, including double-figure 
scoring for senior Greg Gonzalez 
and junior Corey ORourke in 
both games. Gonzalez scored 
16 points on Friday night, while 
pulling down nine rebounds, and 
he followed up with a 20-point 
performance against the Bears. 
ORourke was the catalyst in the 
30-point upset of Washington
on Sunday, dropping 14 points, 
grabbing 11 rebounds and, per
haps most importantly, provid
ing some much-needed pres
sure on the inexperienced play 
of Bear sophomore point guard 
Ross Kelley.
He was definitely getting ner
vous out there, ORourke said. 
I was just trying to create some 
turnovers so that we could get 
out and push the tempo. We 
knew that if it turned into a half
court game, Ruths could wear us 
down inside.
Troy Ruths, the Bears go-to 
offensive weapon, still managed 
to score 16 points, but it was for 
a futile cause. The Tartans cre
ated 22 turnovers and capital
ized on every opportunity they 
were given. Add that to a defen
sive effort that held the Bears to 
36 percent shooting, including a 
horrendous 8 percent from the 
three-point line, and you have

The Carnegie Mellon mens 
and womens indoor track and 
field teams traveled to West 
Virginia University to compete at 
the State Farm Games Saturday, 
Feb. 2. The unscored meet was 
held at the WVU Shell Building.
The Tartans competition 
included West Virginia, Robert 
Morris, and Slippery Rock 
Universities, among a litany of 
other schools in the region. The 
mens team collected two first 
place finishes with sophomore 
Chris Bogie clocking in at 1:06.24 
in the 500-meter dash and junior 
Brian Harvey at 1:58.24 in the 
800-meter. Harvey also tal
lied a second-place finish in the 
3000-meters (8:53.31).
Junior Breck Fresen took sec
ond place in the mile run (4:29.92) 
and senior Drew Miller was close 
behind (4:30.81). Senior Scott 
Fortune finished third in the
800-meter (1:59.27).
First-year Essien Ohues took 
third place in the high jump 
(1.95 meters) and fifth in the 
triple jump with a personal best 
distance of 13.02 meters. Senior 
Eric Tang finished fourth in the 
long jump (6.33 m) and first-year 
Mike Tomovich finished sixth 
(6.18 m).
Sophomore Chris Bridgman 
placed fifth in the pole vault at 
4.26 meters and James Hulley, 
also a sophomore, took seventh 
in the shot put (13.07 m). Junior 
Chris Fornataro placed seventh 
in the weight throw (13.46 m). 
First-year Nate Bussiere placed 
fourth in the 500-meter (1:08.98) 
and sophomore Stephen Carney 
took first for Carnegie Mellon 
in the 400-meter and 11th place 
overall.
It is always exciting to have a 
huge class of freshman runners. 
It will be fun to watch them in 
the next couple meets to see who 
has the natural ability and, more
importantly, the motivation to 
compete at the collegiate level, 
Harvey said.
The team is coming together 
and a bit closer than last year. 
Since we won UAAs last year 
that has sparked a little some
thing in us, Bogie said. We are 
focused, training hard, getting 
through the meets, and keep
ing our eyes on the end goal. 
We have high expectations this 
year. Id like to take a second title 
home, as would everyone else on 
the team.
The womens team collected 
two second-place finishes with 
first-years Courtney Baker drop
ping a 400-meter dash time to 
62.93 seconds, and Laura McKee 
slightly surpassing her own 
time from last weekends meet 
at Denison in the 800-meters 
(2:29.40). Seniors Ashley 
Bakelmun and Shauna Ormon 
took sixth and seventh place in 
the 500-meters at 1:23.61 and 
1:23.78, respectively.
Junior Sami Simmons took 
sixth with a triple-jump distance 
of 10.40 meters and eighth in the 
high jump (4.74 meters). Firstyear Melissa Hwang also came 
in eighth in the high jump at 
4.74 meters. Sophomore Crystal 
LeePow took ninth in the 
800-meter (2:36.15) and sopho
more Rotimi Abimbola placed 
first for Carnegie Mellon, and 
22nd overall, in the 200-meter 
dash (28.79 seconds).
Many of our women set per
sonal records only after two 
meets, which is what we are 
looking for in a growing team. 
We will continue to become more 
competitive as the season pro
gresses, that is definite, Baker 
said. Next Saturday we will be 
at Bucknell, which is a major 
meet for us, because the competi
tion there is very good as well.

The Carnegie Mellon mens 
swimming and diving team de
feated Duquesne and Clarion 
universities on Saturday at a 
University of Pittsburgh meet. 
The team has had a success
ful 2008 season and will com
pete in the University Athletic 
Association Championships Feb. 
20. The Tartan interviewed Andy 
Douglass, a captain of the Tartan 
swim team, on what its like to 
be a scholar athlete at Carnegie 
Mellon and his thoughts on the 
conclusion of his collegiate ath
letic career.
The Tartan: When did you 
first start swimming?
Douglass: I started swimming 
on a team in seventh grade. I 
used to play soccer, and since
I was always swimming in the 
summer at the pool, I thought I 
would try something new.
T: Do you have any memorable 
stories since being on the swim 
team?
D: Shaving my initials into the 
hair of a freshman last year. Just 
generally joking around with the 
coaches is always fun, too.
T: What are your emotions 
concerning the closing of the 
swimming season?
D: I would say sad, in the sense 
that Ill miss the team since its 
35 guys that I hang out with all 
the time. The end of the season 
will give me a chance to try other 
sports though, too.
T: As a senior, what do you 
think you have learned over the 
past four years that you can pass

say to have fun with being an 
athlete. Swimming is the most 
fun thing I have done while here 
at CMU.
T: Do you feel that participat
ing in a sport has helped you 
manage schoolwork?
D: Yes, I feel that swimming has 
been a great release from school. 
There are those two hours every 
day for practice where you dont 
think about classes, and then 
you feel refreshed and ready to 
work.
T: Do you consider yourself 
more a scholar athlete or an ath
lete scholar?
D: Scholar athlete.
T: If you could change some
thing about Carnegie Mellon as 
a student athlete, what would
it be?
D: My standard answer has 
always been that the pool doesnt 
have any spectator seating, but 
that will be changing this sum
mer.
T: How did you choose your 
major?
D: Business is something that 
allows you to have a lot of op
tions for a job, and Ive always 
been interested in history.
T: What do you plan on doing 
after you graduate?
D: I have a job with PNC as a 
foreign exchange trader. Ill be 
working from here in Pittsburgh 
but might travel to Philadelphia 
a little.
T: Are you in any clubs or other 
organizations on campus?
D: I have been a member 
of SAAC [Student Athletic 
Advisory Committee] for the 
past three years, and I [was] the 
BOC [Business Opportunities 
Confence] co-chair [last] year. 
Ive also been on the Presidents 
Student Advisory Council.
T: Whats your favorite book, 
and why?
D: The Polar Express. I dont 
really like any of the books Ive 
read in college as much as this 
classic.
T: What is it like having a sib
ling on the same campus?
D: I have a twin brother that 
goes to Brevard College. My 
younger sister Cary is a sopho
more at CMU. I like that I am 
able to inspire her and have the 
chance to guide her, because she 
is at times lost.
T: Will you watch the Olympics 
this summer? Which swimmers 
will you root for?
D: Yes. Ill be watching Michael 
Phelps, to see if he will be able to 
break Mark Spitzs record.

Successful experiments
Pitt Repertory Theatre succeeds in lab showsEverything you need to know
About being awkward and sleazy friends
Last weekend was an especially experimental time 
for the University of Pittsburghs Repertory Theatre, 
which performed two one-act lab shows before 
audiences in the Cathedral of Learning. Up first was 
The Truth Teller, a play written by Diana Glancy and 
directed by Pitt senior Joseph J. Jackson, followed by 
the controversial Phaedra's Love, written by Sarah 
Kane and directed by senior Andrew McNally.
The Truth Teller
The Truth Teller begins mysteriously. The movement 
cast  six female actresses dressed in black  
emerge from various corners of the stage, producing 
gestures and sounds that make it clear theyre 
supposed to be animals. For most of the opening 
sequence, which lasts at least five minutes, the 
animals crawl, slither, and hop about the stage with 
form thats both beautiful and intriguing  it would be 
perfect, if only it were a little shorter.
As the lead (human) characters begin speaking, 
the nature of The Truth Teller becomes clear  it 
is a thought-provoking work depicting the Native 
American struggle to cope with the arrival of 
white colonists. An unnamed man and woman, 
played respectively by Brittany Andrews and Nate 
Jedrzejewski, explore the impact of European settlers 
on their lives  in addition to the effect on age-old 
themes, truth included.
The man,, who identifies himself as half-white, tells the 
woman about the new things white men have shown 
him  socks, weighted doors, the Bible. The woman, 
both amusing and somewhat pitiful, continues to 
misunderstand what he teachers her; she thinks that 
socks weigh doors shut, for example.
As the title suggests, the play's primary debate 
concerns truth. "How can something like truth be 
changeable? the woman asks, asserting her faith 
that the idea of truth passed down from the elders 
is enduring. The man sees truth as more dynamic, 
insisting that the elders vision and that of the white 
man, the Bible included, might both be right.
Overall, the performances in The Truth Teller were 
excellent; Jedrzejewski and Andrews fell into their 
roles with visible conviction, despite the fact that 
neither of them was the least bit Native American.
The movement cast was equally impressive, holding 
uncomfortable poses on all fours in a performance that 
showed both dedication and realism.
Phaedras Love
English playwright Sarah Kane's Phaedras Love is 
at once disturbing and comical, vulgar and absurd
 and this is evident from the very beginning. The 
play begins with only Prince Hippolytus (played by 
Zack Singer) on the stage, masturbating into a dirty 
sock. The action soon moves to a dialog between 
Queen Phaedra (John Graham) and a doctor (Andrea 
E. Gordon), wherein the two ponder the possible 
causes of Hippolytus sudden depression, weight 
gain, and seclusion. Phaedra, dressed in a flamboyant 
kimono accessorized by a sloshing martini, hints at her 
attraction to Hippolytus (her stepson), an attraction 
she vehemently denies when questioned by the actor.
The truth comes out in a later scene
when Phaedra confesses her love to Strophe, her
daughter.
It's only a matter of time before Phaedra confesses her 
feelings to Hippolytus himself, who absorbs this news 
with cruel indifference. Desperate, Phaedra offers 
Hippolytus a "birthday present  which turns out to 
be oral sex. (In her defense, it really was his birthday.) 
Hippolytus dismisses her, even after receiving his gift, 
which drives Phaedra to suicide.
In the aftermath of Phaedras death, the locals accuse 
Hipppolytus of raping her, and he is sent to jail. A 
fellation, two murders, and a castration later, the play 
ends bleakly and enigmatically, leaving the audience 
members much to ponder.
Phaedra's Love featured a host of talented actors, but 
none could compare to junior John Graham, who was 
literally born for the part of Phaedra. Grahams Phaedra 
was both ridiculous and relatable, eliciting laugher 
and sympathy from the audience simultaneously with 
each line.
Nate Jedrzejewski debates truth and the wisdom 
of white men with Brittany Andrews.
I had talked to [the director] before auditions 
happened, Graham said. "And he said, 'Theres really 
no part for you unless you want to play a chick.' 
Graham was up for the challenge, auditioning for the 
part against a slate of females. I think I might be the 
first man ever to play Phaedra [in any production], he 
said.
The absurdity of a man playing a woman helped calm 
down the disquieting play, Graham explained. It autoalleviates some of the realism, he said.
From Native American profundities to fellatio, last 
weekends lab performances had it all. We can only 
wait to watch the Pitt Repertory Theatre's upcoming 
show, Arthur Millers The American Clock, starting 
Feb. 20.

Dear Rachael,
Ill get to the point. My friend 
is a serial dater extreme: Hell 
get with anything with female 
reproductive organs, even if 
she is dating someone else, 
or in any other way doesnt 
belong to him. He wont stop, 
its like an adrenaline rush for 
him, especially if hes drunk. I 
think its pathetic and I hate the 
fact that I am associated with 
someone that sickening. Ive 
tried telling him that what hes 
doing is wrong, but he brushes 
it off and says its his right. That 
arrogance annoys me  so what 
should I do?
Friend of a Moron,
There, there Friend,
I really like the word moron, it has 
a really delightful touch to it, dont 
you think? But more importantly, 
you raise a very important question. 
What can you do? Yes, you could 
tell him to lay off the booze; but its 
college, and that's unlikely. Besides, 
he probably wont listen to you. Lets 
see, you could warn a girt that hes 
eyeing of her inevitable fate; no no, 
she wont listen to you either. If he 
likes an adrenaline rush, you could 
tell him to jump off a bridge or out 
of a plane; no, that wouldnt work 
either. Its not even worth me thinking 
of other possibilities, because they 
will all lead to the same conclusion
 that you cant do anything.
If he disgusts you so much, cut him 
out of your personal circle. Hes not 
going to change, and if he does, it 
will be of his own accord. Theres 
nothing you can say to him to make 
him change.
In the mean time, watch season one 
of The Tudors; its really good, and it 
shows what happens to people who 
sleep around. In the 16th century, 
syphilis was no joke.
Givin a little love,
Rachael
Dear Rachael,
When I like someone, I cant 
stop thinking about them. Im 
consumed. I think about all the 
different possibilities of how 
and when we can be together, 
what well say, and of course 
what well do. The only problem 
is, its all in my mind. When I 
see the supposed object of my 
secret affection, Im overcome 
and I can barely speak, im too 
awkward for basic conversation, 
let alone ripping said persons 
clothes off and taking them to 
bed. What can I do? Can I get 
over myself and go for it, or will
I be destined to be alone for the 
rest of my life?
Awkward for Life
Oh, Awkward,
Obviously, you already know the 
answers to your own questions. You 
know what to do. Its just a matter 
of doing it. Stripping off someones 
clothes and bedding them, as you 
say, probably shouldnt be your first 
goal though. Try basic conversation
 can you even say hello to your 
secret lover without collapsing of 
awkwardness? And everything else 
will come along by itself, unless your 
attraction Isn't returned. In that case, 
you're SOL. Seriously. But if you can 
manage to get over your awkward 
shyness and compete with your 
peers (there will almost always be 
competition unless you pick the runt 
of the litter  like dogs) you might 
have a chance. Ultimately its up to 
you.
Get on with it!

A Thousand Splendid Suns
Kite Runner author Khaled Hosseini delves into the lives of Afghan women
Khaled Hosseini, the Afghan-American author and physician 
who shot to fame after he made his debut with the heartwrenching bestseller The Kite Runner portrays the suffocating 
image of a war-torn Afghanistan in his latest novel, A 
Thousand Splendid Suns.
Hosseini's Kite Runner focused on patriarchal relationships 
before and during the fall of the monarchy of King Zahir Shah, 
and the collapse of the country into the hands of the Taliban.
A Thousand Splendid Suns builds on this theme, providing 
a feminine perspective on the era that changed Afghanistan 
forever.
In A Thousand Splendid Suns, Hosseini explores the lives 
of two women, Mariam and Laila, who are separated by 
a generation but brought together through a series of 
unfortunate events. The story flows gracefully, as it walks the 
reader through the metamorphosis of the two protagonists' 
relationship from the ugly connotation of co-wives to a bond 
as strong as that between mother and daughter.
When Mariam's mother dies, she is forced into an arranged 
marriage with Rasheed, a mentally disturbed man who 
is about 30 years her senior. Mariams shame at being an 
only child leads her to embody a passive, rather guilty,
temperament. Therefore, she allows her life to be shaped by 
anyone who offers her a form of protection. Her married life 
with Rasheed is tainted by his unceasing demands and years 
of mental, physical, and sexual abuse.
Almost two decades later, in the midst of civil war in Kabul,
15-year-old Laila loses her entire family in a bomb blast. 
Rasheed and Mariam, who live in the same neighborhood as 
Laila, take her in. Mariam nurses Laila back to health, while 
Rasheed supports her financially. However, Rasheed has other 
plans masked behind the charitable figure he pretends to be. 
In the name of shelter and preserving Lailas reputation in 
the society, 60-year-old Rasheed marries 15-year-old Laila to 
satisfy his lust.
The lives of Mariam and Laila are intertwined from then on 
as the country drifts into a state of turmoil, forming the heart 
of the novel. The chapters shuffle between Mariams and 
Lailas perspectives in the form of a third-person narrative, 
portraying the decay of the Afghanistan they both grew up 
in. Their domestic lives entangle with the political upheaval 
in the most unexpected ways, as they represent the strength 
and perseverance that has failed to touch the global image of 
the Afghan woman.
Furthermore, Hosseini cuts through the stereotypical 
image of the Afghan man. While he portrays Rasheed as 
an, oppressive, and radical Muslim, who is an example of 
hypocrisy and primarily a love-to-hate villain, he sheds light 
on his almost saintly and courageous opposite, Tariq, who 
more closely represents the true Afghan man. He portrays 
Tariq, Lailas childhood soulmate, as a compassionate 
husband and a loving father. Tariqs Pashtun identity, which 
is representative of the Pashtun belief in conduct and honor, 
contradicts his unconditional love and ability to sacrifice.
With simple words and deep characters, Hosseini delves into 
the lives of Afghan women before and during the reign of the 
Taliban. By portraying Mariam and Laila as two women with 
drastically different backgrounds yet similar experiences, 
Hosseini tells the tale of the many Mariams and Lailas whose 
lives were overturned by the bloodiest period in the countrys 
history.

Reviews of the Pillbox leftoversOn analyzing Know
Ghislain Poirier* and TTC* Two primarily 
harmonic bands that rely on fresh, electronic hip-hop 
beats to draw in the listener. There's a blatant lack 
of variety within each song, but the overall sound is 
original and unique.
Panthers * Self-described as a hardcore rock band, 
the Panthers have a very punk sound that relies on 
techno beats and soft lyrics while using atypical 
instruments like a tambourine and piano to capture 
the listeners attention. A punk/rock sound not unlike 
The Bravery and Wolfmother, the Panthers are heavy 
rockers who won't be going away any time soon.
Armand Van Helden* Primarily a remixer, Armands 
song Witch Doktor, off of his EP, incorporates street 
sounds, like a siren, with a heavy techno beat to create 
the perfect rave music.
Yellowman* Yellowman is a Jamaican reggae artist 
who has had a wide influence on the world of hip-hop. 
His hit "Zungguzungguguzungguzeng" is similar to 
work by artists like BIG., Tupac, and Mos Def. It boasts 
a steady rhythm and unmistakable sound that even the 
worst dancer can move to.
Betty Davis* In her song If Im in Luck I Might Get 
Picked Up, Davis uses funky grooves and an eclectic 
guitar rift that slow down the songs pace, allowing 
for an easy-listening song that is light-years ahead of 
elevator music. Davis's raspy voice also adds to the 
songs overall style.
Justin Vellucci, Terminal Harbor Justin Vellucci 
is a folk artist for the Internet generation, with a poetic 
style that rivals the greatest wordsmith. In his album 
Terminal Harbor, Justin Vellucci explores every aspect 
of indie singing and songwriting, creating a piece 
of artwork that cannot be tied down. A resident of 
Pittsburgh, Vellucci mixes in an array of bizarre yet 
pleasurable noises as background music to his singing 
and acoustic guitar.
Big Leg Emma, Live in 2007 This group of country
folk artists melds rock and hip-hop into its songs to 
create a unique genre that never leaves its folk roots.
An acoustic guitar is prevalent, though a synthesizer 
and various other string instruments can be heard in
The horn section of Four Finger 
Five during a live performance.
their music, which varies in pace and sound ever so 
slightly. Big Leg Emma uses touching, hearty lyrics to 
woo listeners into a deep sense of emotion.
Alice Smith, For Lovers, Dreamers & Me With 
a powerful voice, jazzy soul singer Alice Smith 
broadly explores the range of emotion and feeling 
she is able to hit. Her smooth, strong, yet romantic 
style overpowers the senses on her debut album,
For Lovers, Dreamers & Me. With accompanying 
instruments ranging from an electric violin to a 
trumpet, her beautiful, inspiring songs rise to new 
heights. Smith is definitely someone to watch out for 
in the coming years.
Nicole Atkins, Neptune City On her album 
Neptune City, also her Jersey hometown, Nicole 
Atkins blends traditional lyrics with a psychedelic 
sound to produce an inspiring and introspective look 
into her early life. Atkins lovely voice is accompanied 
by guitar, keyboard, and bass, giving her songs a 
groovy yet modern touch.
Soft, Gone Faded An indie rock band with a 
sound and feel of the Smashing Pumpkins, Softs 
debut album, Gone Faded focuses on quiet vocals 
accompanied by electric guitar. Lead singer John 
Reineck carries this band with a heavenly voice that 
touches every nerve. Although newcomers to the 
musical landscape, Soft is a group of wildly talented 
indie artists who seem destined to hit the big time. 
Gone Faded is a beautifully mastered debut album 
built with painstaking care and a joy to listen to.
Four Finger Five, Four Finger Five With 
influences ranging from the jazzy stylings of A1 Green 
to punk rockers The Clash, Four Finger Five has 
crafted a unique style. The band's music ranges in 
tone from soft elevator music to faster paced jazz-rock. 
The inclusion of trumpets, organs, and a saxophone 
results in a strange and varied musical style thats hard 
to find today.

Editors note: Bands with asterisks (*) next to their 
names denote promotional albums.
Nick Drakes Know is two minutes and 25 seconds long, falling right on 
the boundary for average song length on the artists landmark album Pink 
Moon, and yet it is Spartan compared to everything else on the record. 
The guitar provides only the rhythm, a repeated slapping twang as Drake 
croons wordlessly over it. And then, at the one-minute, thirteen-second 
mark, he comes out with: Know that I love you/Know I dont care/Know 
that I see you/Know Im not there."
And thats it. A small wordless coda over the guitar and the song is over. 
Consider just what is packed into that set of words, the multitude of ways 
in which they can be parsed. The simple fact is that the phrases are so 
resilient, so vague and yet also approachable, that any interpretation I 
could provide here would quite possibly differ completely from the meaning 
that you yourself pull from the text. So I'm not going to. Instead, I'm going 
to provide a diagram.
Person A: [I know/You know/Know] that I love you[!/?/.] Person [A/B]:/? 
know/You know/Know/No,] I dont care[!/?/.] Person [A/B]:// know/You 
know/Know] that I see you[!/?/.] Person [A/B]: [I know/You know/Know/ 
No,] Im not there]!/?/.]
The diagram is dense, but it shows how, based on the dithering of a few 
variables, you can generate at least a dozen messages about apathy and 
love. (Here's a hint: The T indicates the imperative form of the sentence.)
Now, I'm not saying that these meanings are all markedly different; four 
commands telling someone that you love them, dont care about them, can 
see them, and are absent are hardly different from four factual statements 
about the same thing. But at the extreme ends, an interpretation can run 
the gamut from Drakes take on God to a dialogue between stalker and 
stalked to the mumblings of the schoolboy who sits all day alone in his 
room. Clusters of similar readings are scattered across the same barren 
waste of sadness, some observations at the microscopic level and others 
at the macro, some magnified versions of others, and some completely 
unique.
Many songs have a limited ability to be generalized. I have no doubt that 
someone, somewhere in the world can convincingly argue that the ideas 
present in Baby Got Back can be metaphorically applied to aspects of 
ones relationships with friends, lovers, humanity, and the divine (this is 
perhaps the most depressing thing you will read all day) so claiming that 
"Know can be interpreted on many different levels is not novel. But Know 
isnt some kind of verbose musical praise to someone's booty. Its sparse. 
Its nothing. All the scaling that you choose to apply to the song is upward, 
to more extreme, more potent meanings than the acoustic guitar suggests. 
Forget hooks; in four lines Know is a small constellation of thoughts, and I 
leave it as an exercise for the reader to determine the one that is best.

Spoiler alert: Lost returns for its
Premiere poses many questions, answers none
Damned if you do, damned if you dont. That seems to be the 
motto for the characters of ABCs mystery/drama Lost, whose 
lives are as traumatic on the island as when they were off 
it  and as they will be once a select few make it back to the 
mainland.
Future tense is acceptable in season four, which premiered 
last Thursday, as the creators of Lost have added 
flashforwards to the shows repertoire of character-defining 
flashbacks and on-island drama. For Lost, the flashforward 
technique debuted in the season three finale, a Jack-centric 
episode suggesting a grim future for those castaways 
unfortunate enough to return to civilization.
The episode, called "Through the Looking Glass, followed 
spinal surgeon Jack, sporting a new beard and alcohol 
dependency to boot, as he arrived as the sole attendee to an 
unnamed islanders funeral. As the credits rolled and Lost 
fans prepared for eight months of webisodes and DVDs, the 
question remained: Whos in the coffin?
Season fours opener, darkly titled "The Beginning of the 
End, shed little light on the identity of the deceased.
Viewers learned the phrase "Oceanic Six, referring to the 
apparently six Losties able to make it off the island. The 
"Six are something like B-list celebrities (perhaps on par 
with the Numa Numa kid), and include, so far as anyone 
knows, Jack, Kate, Hurley, the person in the coffin, and two 
unknowns.
Speaking of Hurley, the episode revolved around him  a 
surprise for fans, who were used to Jack-centric premieres, 
as was the case in seasons one, two, and three. Though 
unexpected, a Hurley-centric episode seems to be just what 
the show needed, as many viewers complained that season 
three dwelled on the comparatively svelte castaways Jack, 
Kate, and Sawyer.
I was actually glad to see it was Hurley in the center, said 
Ricardo Vilaro, a senior business major, longtime fan of Lost,
6 television
Pillbox 02.04.08
Zack Wallnau | Comics Editor
and admittedly not a fan of Jack and Kate. I thought [the 
third season] started off really slow, he added, referring to the 
seasons first half, which revolved tirelessly around Jack, Kate, 
and Sawyer  before Lost got its act together and returned to 
the ensemble.
Hurley  the plus-sized islander who taught us that even a 
diet of fear, hopelessness, and papaya fruit can't always trim 
your waistline  has always been a significant member of the 
shows cast, cheering up his fellow Losties with diversions 
like an on-island golf course. As a Feb. 1 article in New York 
Magazine pointed out, Hurleys jolly disposition and clean 
slate (hes one of the few castaways that is neither a convict, 
addict, or divorc) might have been a strategic choice by 
the show's creators to balance out the premieres gloomy 
overtones. With a name like The Beginning of the End, you 
need all the help you can get.
Among the more gloomy moments of the premiere was the 
castaways split into, two groups, led by man of science"
Jack and man of faith John. The source of the split is a 
soon-to-arrive rescue boat, which should either help the 
Losties off the island or, as longtime islander Ben warns, 
kill them all. John, perhaps still floored that the island 
de-paralyzed his spine, heads up the faction of boat-wary 
characters, while Jack  who wants to get the hell away from 
Kate, Sawyer, and the insipient love triangle  convinces the 
remaining Losties to wait with him for rescue.
A couple things are interesting here. First, Hurley is among 
the John-following castaways, while Kate sticks with Jack, 
suggesting that  somehow  members of the Oceanic 
Six could come from either side of the rift. Sawyer stays with 
John as well, while three-year islander Juliet tags along with 
Jack, which means the Jack-Kate-Sawyer triangle may soon 
become a Jack-Kate-Juliet.
Moreover, as New York Magazine observed, all of the 
characters on Team John are a little crazy (Hurley's been in 
a mental institution, for one thing), and most of them are
fourth season
single (Alex and Karl are dating, but hey, theyre teenagers). 
The Internet has already erupted with fan-based speculations 
on what this arrangement might lead to; for example: 
Frenchwoman Rousseau could wind up canoodling with Ben, 
who kidnapped her child 17 years earlier.
In addition to the major plot turns, the Lost premiere included 
some small (and yet still fascinating) twists as well. Case in 
point: The letters H" and 0 were featured prominently 
throughout Hurleys flash-forward, as documented on the 
Lostpedia fansite, at www.lostpedia.com. First, Hurley freaks 
out at a local convenience store when he sees Charlie's 
ghost appear before a rack of Ho Hos. Then, the mysterious 
newcomer Matthew Abbadon interrogates Hurley about the 
island, while the letters H and O" are on the wall behind 
them. Last, Jack and Hurley play the basketball game "Horse, 
stopping when Jack has the letters "H" and O." And if that 
isnt eerie, "H" and "O are respectively the eighth and 15th 
letters of the alphabet (the numbers eight and 15, among 
others, are important in the show).
What does it all mean? We dont know yet, and we may never 
fully understand, but that mystery is exactly what pulls so 
many fans to Lost.
The Lost premiere posed many questions while answering 
none, which means fans  whether they like it or not  are 
going to have to wait a lot longer than 85 minutes to satisfy 
their curiosity.
I dont really think too far ahead-, Vilaro said. I just want to 
know who's in the coffin."

Not hot wings  a lady doesnt finger-lick in public! SM
Wheres the best place to watch the Super Bowl?
In whatever city one of the playing teams is from. Rioting is 
always sure to ensue. SS
What do you think of the Super Bowl halftime show?
I think its a little overrated. Sometimes its good, though. Like 
Justin Umberlake [revealing] Janet Jackson's breast to the 
world was priceless. SS
Tom Petty is uber-great. JT
Commercials are better than aged musicians  Stones, 
Prince, Dylan, etc. JR
Whats your favorite Super Bowl commercial?
The Budweiser "What are you doing? series. It makes me feel
good to watch people as lame as I am. SM
I saw a preview for a Justin Timberlake Pepsi commercial, and 
it was super funny Mostly because Andy Samberg was in a 
blonde wig brushing his hair. Dick in a Box Part Two! RC
Whats your favorite football team and why?
The Giants. Someone important told me so. MK
Im a Giants fan by proxy  Im from New York and I really 
dont like the Jets. However, after three years in Pittsburgh, 
I'm definitely a Steelers fan too. SS

Well, I have family who grew up in Pittsburgh, so Ive been 
trained to be a Steelers fan since birth. LS
Whats your opinion of the Super Bowl?
I'm okay with it  it continues to impress me how many 
people, guys especially, are enthusiastic about watching men 
tackle each other in spandex. SM
I think the Super Bowl is very commercialized, and its 
fantastic. Its a good time for people to hang out, eat snacks, 
and go crazy. I'm all about team spirit, so I definitely think the 
Super Bowl is a big deal. Plus, die-hard fans are just way too 
entertaining to pass up. SS
I wish I could go.... JR
I don't like sports at all, and football is second after baseball in 
my This Makes No Sense; Why Do People Watch This?" list. 
But, hey, whatever gets people together with the promise of 
food is pretty good to me. MZ
Why do you watch (or not watch) the Super Bowl?
To get away from doing my homework, and in the hopes of 
finding a burning couch or car in the middle of the street 
afterwards. SS
To check out what the photographers on the sidelines are 
shooting with. JR
Are you glad that this is the last major game of the 
season (besides the Pro Bowl)?
Yeah. It's about time for eating competitions to take back the 
spotlight. SM
Definitely. Im so freaking tired of hearing about the Patriots.

Sidney Lumet (Serpico,

story of family dysfunction

acted films of 2007, Before the 
Devil Knows Youre Dead is a 
heartbreaking story of a mom 
and pop jewelry store robbery 
gone wrong and the effect it 
has on the players involved.
We are presented with a cast 
of very flawed individuals who 
could easily be the people we 
see every day. Overall, Before 
the Devil Knows Youre Dead 
is a uniquely shot and edited 
film that was one of the bigger 
snubs of the Oscar season.

War. At various points, the film 
includes a total of 33 Beatles 
songs to further the plot, making 
it feel much like a music video at 
times. If you want a thoroughly 
enjoyable movie experience, or 
just want to hear some Beatles

transports Ben Wade, played 
by Russell Crowe (Gladiator), 
to a train that is coincidentally 
departing to Yuma at 3:10.
Crowe is brilliant as the sinister 
yet slick Wade who never stops 
trying to get in the head of Bales 
character. A Western of the 
old-fashioned kind, 3:10 to Yuma 
captures a beautiful, untamed 
West that has long since been 
tamed and developed. This is a 
film for the Western buffs among 
us and those of us with colossal 
man(or woman-) crushes on 
Christian Bale.
Eyes Wide Shut
Sunday, Feb. 10
7 10 1
Eyes Wide Shut is a sexual 
adventure film that received an 
NC-17 rating when first released in 
1999, starring then-married couple 
Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. 
Director Stanley Kubrick keeps 
you guessing even after the credits 
finish rolling, making for more of a 
thinking mans film than you may 
expect. Bill Hartford (Cruise) is a 
doctor who gets involved in a series 
of unbelievable sexual incidents 
following his wifes (Kidman) 
admission that she almost cheated 
on him. From the dark alleyways of 
New York to a mysterious mansion 
orgy, this film explores every possible 
fantasy situation you could dream 
of, which will probably be the reason 
many of you go see it.

PITTSBURGH CELEBR.
The Chinese New Year, also called the Spring Festival, or 
Chunjie, is the most important holiday among all of the 
traditional Chinese holidays. It represents the end of winter 
and the beginning of spring. Although it is a time to reflect 
on the past year, most of all, the Chinese New Year is viewed 
as a time to look toward the future in a positive light  a 
red light preferably, as red is thought to bring good luck and 
fortune. The celebrations sweep away the old with some 
tough cleaning, debt payments, and even noisy firecrackers
 although in many urban areas in China, firecrackers have 
been banned due to too many accidents.
This is a very important new year for the Chinese residents 
and students of Pittsburgh for a variety of reasons. For 
those who call this city a home, whether permanently 
or temporarily, 2008 is also Pittsburghs 250th birthday. 
Also, across the Pacific, China will be celebrating the 30th 
anniversary of its reform, which brought historic changes 
to mainland China and caused the country to open up. It 
is these reforms that make the Chinese all the more proud 
to be hosting the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. With so many 
things to celebrate and a clear sight of a promising future, 
this year is one to be especially cherished and 
embraced by the Pittsburgh Chinese population 
and its neighbors.
This year, the Chinese New Year falls on 
Thursday, Feb. 7, and will welcome the Year 
of the Rat. Every year, the Chinese New Year 
falls on a different date because the Chinese 
calendar is based on a mix of lunar and solar 
movements. The lunar cycle lasts for about
29.5 days, and just as the Western calendar 
adds an extra day in a leap year to catch 
up," the Chinese insert an extra month once 
every few years to "catch up" to the solar 
calendar.
The Chinese New Year begins with the first new moon 
and ends 15 days later, on a bright, full moon. New 
Year's Eve and New Years Day are celebrated with 
family; traditionally, people even invoke the spirits of 
their ancestors to leave no member out. The 15th day of 
the new year, known as the Lantern Festival, or Shang 
Yuan Festival, is celebrated at night when children 
carry lanterns in parades, and streets, homes, and 
shops also display lanterns.
For many Carnegie Mellon students and
Pittsburgh residents 
alike, the New Year 
can be a difficult time, 
full of homesickness.
Chinese New Year is c 
very important holiday, 
during the year that everyone in the family 
gathers around for dinner," said Bo Gui, a junior in biomedical 
and chemical engineering. Being overseas, my immediate 
family is smaller than the extended one back in China ... [and 
it's] difficult being away from home because its nice to see 
the family during this time of year [and] I can't receive my red 
envelope which normally would be full of money."
It is for this reason that the Chinese community comes 
together in different events across campuses and the city. 
Every year, Carnegie Mellons group, Awareness of Roots in 
Chinese Culture (ARCC), hosts a Chinese New Year dinner. 
This years dinner was on Friday, Feb. 1, and included a show 
full of Chinese dances and music.
We wanted to provide a good home-cooked meal and fun 
entertainment for everybody that came," said ARCC president 
and ECE senior Randy Ma. Some of our board members 
acted out a skit telling the story of [the] Chinese New Year 
for those who are not familiar with it. The event was a great 
success overall."
ARCC members cooked traditional Chinese foods for their 
guests, as they have done in previous years. This year, 
the members put together a delicious menu. They served 
appetizers of dumplings and radish cakes, and had an 
impressive list of main courses: Chinese sausage with 
cabbage, pork ribs with black bean sauce, three-cup chicken, 
beef with oyster sauce, and fried rice noodles. Their vegetable 
menu included tofu with vegetables, oriental vegetables, and 
Chinese baby greens with oyster sauce. Dessert included 
orange slices and Chinese New Year cake, or nian gao, which 
literally translates into year cake." Although it can be eaten 
throughout the year, it is most popular to eat during the new 
year especially because, verbally, nian gao can be heard to 
mean "year high," which is interpreted as every year, higher 
and higher."
"The most difficult thing, as it has been in the previous years 
we've done it, was to cook enough food for more than 100 
people," Ma said. With only 20 people on our board, we 
had to spread ourselves pretty thin between the kitchens,

shame. Their performance was similar to gymnastics, as it 
was geared to apply both bare-handed and weapon forms 
of kung fu to meet aesthetic criteria alongside some bloodpumping Chinese martial arts music. From front flips to 
smooth, curving spin kicks in the air, these performers put up 
relentless sequences of acrobatic moves and jumps to exhibit 
beautiful acrobatic forms.
transportation, 
setting up the room, 
and performances.
' 111 ARCC also put on a show
with various traditional dances. 
Members even performed a fusion dance, 
which combined modern and traditional 
techniques. This proved to be a popular show.The most beautiful musical performance was the eihu solo. 
The erhu is a traditional Chinese instrument, known in the 
west as the Chinese violin," or the Chinese two-string 
fiddle," played sitting down, with the instrument mounted 
on the top of the left leg. When many people think of 
traditional Chinese music, it is the sound of the erhu 
they play in their heads. It sounds similar to a Western 
violin, but its sound stretches farther and creates a 
more strained voice. Played by Shuo Zhang, the solo 
touched many audience members. From the seats one 
could see grandfathers smiling as they watched their 
little grandchildren listen and feel the general nostalgia 
hovering above the seats, which was further intensified 
when Miao Ge sang "I Love You, China.
I would have to say my favorite performance was the fusion 
fan dance by the girls of ARCC," Gui said. They are just so 
graceful on stage, and it was very well rehearsed.
This dance was choreographed by Judith Sun, a business 
administration alumna from Carnegie Mellon. Elegantly 
posing their fans while moving swiftly, the girls of ARCC 
put on a great performance of this dance both at the dinner 
and at the 2008 Chinese New Year celebration at Soldiers
& Sailors Memorial last Saturday, Feb. 2. This celebration 
united various individuals and groups from the city, and even 
overseas, to celebrate the new year together in one event.
The show was very successful and everyone is 
so happy. We had so many groups come to 
participate. Everyone worked very hard, 
said a proud and enthusiastic Wanda Wang, 
chief producer of the Chinese New Year 
2008 celebration. "Our first performance 
had women from ages around 40 to 50, 
but even though they are older, they still 
participated.... The martial artists just arrived 
this morning, around 10 a.m., from China....
The North Allegheny High School students, 
even though they are so busy with school, 
all we had to do was just ask them, and they 
just came. They all had a lot of fun, too!
I think that the idea is to bring the Chinese population 
together, those who want to stay in touch with their culture 
and each other," said Alice Wang, a senior in chemical 
engineering and an ARCC fusion fan dance performer. I grew 
up in America, so it is nice to become immersed in Chinese 
culture once in a while, especially [at] times like the Chinese 
New Year.
The event was sponsored by the Chinese Association 
of Science and Technology Pittsburgh Chapter and the 
Pittsburgh Chinese School. The show included a three-hour 
repertoire with performers from the Oriental Star Dance 
School (both the young and adult groups), the Anhui Zhige 
Wushu Academy, the Organization of Chinese Americans, 
the University of Pittsburgh's Chinese Students & Scholars 
Association, the Pittsburgh Chinese School, Chatham College 
students, and the North Allegheny High School Orchestra and 
Golden Strolling String group.
The Chinese revere the rat for its wit and 
its ability to collect and keep items of value, and 
are excited to welcome back the rat and all that it 
symbolizes. The Chinese New Year has yet to come, 
but it seems the Pittsburgh community cant wait until 
Thursday.
The characters below signify 
"Happy New Year" in Chinese

through dancing, singing, modeling for a fashion show, or 
the playing of various string instruments. The most shocking

Traditional Chinese recipes to help celebrate the new year
The Chinese New Year celebration is filled with tradition, 
a large part of which involves traditional foods and the 
superstitions that come with them. Despite the fact that 
the Chinese do not usually celebrate the new year with 
large parties, they have plenty of food to be eaten with their 
families and friends while they reflect upon the past and look 
forward to the future.

The Carnegie Mellon hockey club won 
its third straight game with a decisive 
score of 8-5. Funny thing is, the game 
almost didnt even happen. Lockhaven, 
the opposing team, arrived 30 minutes 
late, almost forfeiting, and Lockhaven 
spent the entire game with an incomplete 
team of only 13 players. With these 
kinds of conditions, Tartan hockey didnt 
even have to resort to remote control

guarantee victory.

Superstitions
The Chinese New Year is full of superstitions, many of which 
surround the traditional foods eaten during the festival. Foods 
like whole fish represent abundance, and serving plenty of 
food symbolizes wealth for the household in which theyre 
served. A whole chicken complete with head and feet is 
symbolic of a persons completeness, a concept common in 
Chinese thought and tradition. The Chinese also believe that 
red is a lucky color, and that it scares away evil. Red foods, 
then, are common, and Nian Gao (sticky cake) is sometimes 
made with red beans and wrapped in a red decorative cover.
Recipes
While many traditional foods can be found at Chinese New 
Year parties or pre-made from commercial sellers, it is far 
more traditional to make them at home. With these recipes, 
you can make and enjoy traditional Chinese foods for the new 
year (even if you aren't Chinese).
Nian Gao: Nian gao is the traditional Chinese New Year 
sticky cake made from glutinous rice. It is traditionally 
steamed but can also be baked. While baking will result in a 
different consistency, its quicker and easier to make if you 
dont have four hours to spend making your nian gao.
Steamed:
11/2 cups water 
21/2 cups dark brown sugar 
41/2 cups sweet glutinous rice flour 
1/2 cup vegetable oil
First, combine the water and brown sugar in a small pot.
Bring this to a boil, then simmer on a lower heat until all 
the sugar is dissolved (about five minutes). Add vegetable
oil to the mixture and combine. Keep 1/4 of the mixture in 
a separate container for later use. Pour the larger mixture of 
sugar, oil, and water into a large bowl and mix in the flour.
Check out an article on 
this year's local Chinese 
New Year's celebrations on 
page 8
Baked:
16 ounces sweet glutinous rice flour 
3 eggs, 3/4 cup of oil 
21/2 cups milk 
1 cup sugar
1 tablespoon baking soda
Combine all ingredients and mix well. Oil a 9" x 13" baking 
pan and sprinkle with rice flour. Spread the dough into the 
pan and bake at 350 degrees for 45 minutes. Allow cake to 
cool and slice to serve.
Longevity Noodles: According to Chinese tradition, these 
noodles must not be cut in order to retain their luck. The 
noodles are symbolic of a long life and are also served on 
birthdays.
1 pound thin egg noodles
3 cups chicken stock 
1 tablespoon soy sauce 
1 teaspoon sesame oil
1 teaspoon cornstarch
2 green onions
2 tablespoons cooked ham (cubed)
Fill a large pot with water and, once water boils, add salt and 
noodles to the water. Separate noodles with chopsticks while 
cooking, being careful not to break the noodles. Rinse noodle.1 
in cold water, drain, and separate into four individual bowls. 
Boil chicken stock in a medium saucepan. Mix cornstarch 
with 2 teaspoons water and add cornstarch mixture, soy 
sauce, and sesame oil to the stock. Beat eggs together and 
slowly pour them into the stock mixture. When eggs are 
cooked, pour equal amounts of stock mixture into each noodli 
bowl. Garnish with slices of green onion and ham.

four years ago, the EOC has almost doubled 
in employer attendance, and the number of 
employer sponsors has almost tripled in the past 
two years alone.
Employers are looking for the best and brightest 
college students and recent grads in their fields.

What to expect when youre expecting 
[a job]: How to prep for the EOC
As the big day nears, anxiety may run high. Keep your nerves at bay by 
preparing ahead of time.
1. Revise your resume
Make it count. Most recruiters will 
only spend a few seconds on your 
resume before giving it a yes or 
a "no. Highlight your proudest 
and most current achievements 
that best qualify you for the job. 
Consider drafting different resumes 
tailored for jobs in different fields. 
Remember that design counts  
keep the information easy to read 
and down to one page. Dont forget 
to proofread for spelling, grammar, 
and punctuation. Theres nothing 
like a typo to set you apart from 
the crowd  in a bad way.
To make recruiters' jobs easier, 
divide your resume into sections: 
education, experience and other 
activities, course work, skills, 
and possibly intferests. Dont be
afraid to let your personality shine 
through  if you do something 
that makes you unique, say so! Do 
you speak another language? Know 
HTML? Details like these may give 
you an edge over other applicants, 
and help the recruiter remember 
you. And dont forget to display 
your name and contact information 
clearly and prominently.
2. Knowledge is power
Read up on the industry or 
company youll be interviewing for. 
Not only will it give you a better 
idea of what youre getting yourself 
into, itll show your employer that 
you know your field, youve made 
a commitment to the company, 
and you understand what the job 
entails.
And equally important, think 
about yourself. Consider which 
experiences have taught you the 
most about the industry for which 
youre interviewing and be ready to 
share them. Prepare an explanation 
of how your personal views and 
interests align with the company's, 
and why youre interested in the 
position. Lastly, think about what 
you can do for them  consider 
how your skills can contribute to 
the companys success.
I I3. Make a game plan
Decide which employers youre 
going to visit ahead of time. Check 
the map on page 6 to see where 
theyre located, and decide the 
order in which you're going to visit 
them. Dont forget to print enough 
resumes for everyone.
Succeeding at the EOC: How to bring 
your positive energy forward
When surrounded by employers, you may feel overwhelmed. Make yourself 
stand out by showing them how much you want the job.
from SUCCEED, page Al
bathroom before you get there. No 
pushing. Dont interrupt.
4. Ask questions.
A few pointed, well-informed 
questions can speak well for you. 
Asking serious questions about 
what the position entails shows 
the recruiter that youre seri
ous about the job, in addition to 
more specific questions about the 
company  this will show that 
youre interested in what they do 
and want to learn more. Dont be 
afraid to ask questions about any
thing the recruiter says that you 
dont understand  itll help you 
and show the recruiter that youve 
been actively listening.
5. Be positive.
Dont waste precious interview 
minutes bashing previous em
ployers or discussing negative 
classroom experiences. Spend the 
time talking about positive learn
ing experiences and how theyve 
prepared you for the job.
6. Follow up.
Drop the employer a line (via snail 
mail) a few days after your inter
view. Remind him or her who you 
are, where you met, the position 
you interviewed for, and the con
versation you had. Ask to meet 
again to discuss the position. This 
shows gratitude and manners, as 
well as initiative  a quality nec
essary for any job.
7. You schmooze, you lose.
Yes, wining and dining is a signifi
cant part of the work world, but 
make it count. Dont introduce 
yourself and make small talk with 
people in your field only to never 
see them again. Approach every 
situation as a networking opportu
nity, and step up and ask your ac
quaintances for their contact in
formation. The work-o-sphere can 
be cutthroat, and you may need 
all the help you can get. Plus, 
statistics show that roughly 75 
percent of jobs are won through 
networking. But regardless of 
whether your network gets you a 
job or not, it cant hurt to get your 
foot in the door.

I spent most of yesterday watching Flavor 
of Love in my pajamas.
You know, I get really bad dandruff in 
the winter.
So, am I the best person youve 
interviewed so far?
The last time I came to one of these 
things, no one would hire me. I'm still 
trying to figure out why.
Man, I totally woke up 10 minutes ago.
Sorry. I'm a mess today. I had a fight 
with my boyfriend last night. He wanted 
to do it with the lights on. And I'm just 
not ready for that, you know?
Actually, I don't think hes my boyfriend. 
Im pretty sure were just hooking up.
Is my shirt see-through?
Between you and me, this whole thing 
is kind of a sham. You never find anyone 
you actually want to hire.
Im not saying I wouldnt take this job... I 
just have to see if that would be a strategic 
career move for me a few months down 
the road, given all the other offers I have 
on the table right now.
The last time I was fired, my boss said it 
was because I had self-control issues. I 
dont know how he could,know that after
I had only worked there six months.
Im kind of a big deal.

Keeping up 
appearances: When 
looks do matter
Carnegie Mellon students 
aren't exactly known for 
their stellar fashion sense. 
A word of advice  let the 
EOC be the exception. We 
know that in theory youre 
not supposed to judge a 
book by its cover, but real
istically, there are situations 
in which what you look like 
speaks loudly, for better or 
worse, on your behalf. Go 
ahead and use the guide 
below to make sure youre 
dressed for the part.
Girls:
Err on the conservative 
side. Try to wear a dark 
suit jacket with a skirt or 
dress pants and closed-toe 
shoes. (Ditch the stilettos.) 
If you decide on a skirt, 
wear nude-colored panty
hose. Accessories are fine 
and will help you custom
ize your look  just stay 
away from chunky jewelry 
or anything too flashy.
Guys:
Wear a dark suit with a 
light-colored shirt, necktie, 
shoes (with black socks), 
and a belt. Try to match  
at least avoid the black-onbrown combination. Also, 
stay subtle: Stay away from 
using too much cologne.
Both:
When in doubt, go for the 
power colors  red and 
navy or yellow and navy. 
Avoid any blinding color 
combinations, such as lime 
green and magenta, or any 
member of the neon fam
ily. In addition  and we 
regret having to say this  
grooming counts, namely 
showering. Dont leave the 
house with wet hair. Make 
sure your nails look reason
ably neat, and moisturize 
your hands if necessary  
just as no one likes a dead 
fish handshake, no one 
likes a scaly one, either.
