CMU President visits E-Tower
By MAX CfflTTISTER
Tartan Assistant News Editor
On Monday, April 3, CMU President 
Robert Mehrabian spoke to a group of 50 
students on the fourth floor of Morewood 
E-Tower. He spoke for approximately 15 
minutes, and then entertained questions 
for about an hour. He was accompanied 
by Dean of Student Affairs Michael 
Murphy.
The program was organized by the E4resident assistant, JoshWisch, a sopho
more in social and decision sciences. He 
said that during a recent speech given 
on the floor by H&SS Dean Peter Steams, 
somebodyjokingly asked him ifhe would 
have the president give the next speech. 
He spoke to Mehrabian during his open 
office hours, and suggested that the presi
dent give a speech about student satis
faction. Wisch said that Mehrabian 
seemed very personable.
The program was also the result of a 
meeting where RAs were advised to have 
more educational programs on their 
floors. Wisch felt that there would be 
more of an impact ... if we got people 
who were recognizable.
At the beginning of his speech, 
Mehrabian said that student satisfac
tion was something you have to tell me 
about. He then described several 
projects happening on campus which 
should increase student satisfaction. The 
main project he pointed to was the $47 
million University Center, which he de
scribed as a vast improvement over 
Skibo.
Other building projects, such as Rob
erts Hall, the Arts Center, and the CFA 
renovation, were also cited.
Mehrabian said that, he wants to imMU students elect new

Gina Schuyler was elected as 
lenext Student Body President 
r the 1995-96 academic year, 
ccording to the unofficial results 
'om the Senate elections.
This years election had a poor 
Qrnout. Out of 6,966 people eliible to vote, only 462 voted. This 
presented 6.5 percent of the 
hident population. This percentge is a decrease from last years 
2.3 percent turnout.
Schuyler ran as a write-in can
didate against Jeffrey Rand, 
avid Schimmel, John Studarus, 
ffldNeeraj Tuli. Schuyler, who is 
junior history student, ran on 
he platform of improving CMU.
I will utilize the position to focus 
on improving the quality of stu
dent life at Carnegie Mellon Uni
versity, she announced in her 
platform. Schuyler addressed the 
negativism which plagues the 
campus and planned to attack 
the problems that add to stress. 
The areas she has on her agenda 
are advising, Career services, 
Health Services and Dining Ser
vices.
Schuyler was very pleased with 
her apparent victory. I would 
like to thank everyone who of
fered their support before and 
during the election, she said, Im 
really excited to have the oppor
tunity to serve the students... as 
Student Body President. I intend 
to follow through on the goals I 
outlined in my platform. 
Schuyler encouraged people to
email her if they have any ques
tions or comments at gs3n.
Ray Ardire was elected to the 
position of Student Body Trea
surer. The position is currently 
being held by Emma Gosden. I 
want to take up where Emma left 
off, said the IM sophomore. I 
want to keep going in the same 
direction because she made 
changes that were for the better. 
Ardire served this year on the 
Funding and Recognition Com
mittee. Ardire was not familiar 
with Schuyler so could not com
ment on working with her.
Schuyler was victorious in an 
election that saw much contro
versy. It began when Schimmels 
plan file was copied into several 
public bboards. The comments

prove the retention rate of students. He 
wants to increase mobility between col
leges on campus, and emphasize early 
intervention and advising for students 
who want to leave CMU.
He pointed out that in the last five 
years, the freshman dropout rate has 
dropped from 15.2 percent to 10.3 per
cent. Another main point that Mehrabian 
made was diversity on campus. Were 
going to have to look like America, he 
said. As part of the effort to create cul
tural diversity, the Modern Languages 
budget has been quadrupled for stu
dents majoring in international busi
ness.
Our primary job is to insure we do the 
best we can for you [the students], he 
concluded. In responding to a question 
about how to create a strong community 
spirit, Mehrabian said, We havent had 
a nlar.p that.is rpntral and pviHpnt. thp
University Center will address a signifi
cant part of it. He also wants to promote 
more outdoor activities, such as Spring 
Carnival, a campus picnic, outdoor mov
ies, and a possible comedy program in 
early May, in order for students to get 
together more.
A student at the speech expressed 
concern that sports on campus were not 
given enough emphasis.
Mehrabian responded that he did not 
know how to make people go out and 
watch sports, but weve invested in 
sports quite a bit.
After the meeting, Mehrabian com
mented, That was one of the best meet
ings ... with the students that he had 
ever experienced. It was nice ... to talk 
in an informal manner. Theyre so dedi

Fraternitys booth collapses
By ED WARD HAYES
Tartan News Editor
Three members of the Alpha 
Epsilon Pi (AEPi) fraternity were 
injured Wednesday afternoon 
when their booth collapsed dur
ing construction on the Midway.
The three students, Aaron 
Weisberg, Andrew Yeckel and 
Eric Shapow, were working on 
the fraternitys Animaniacs 
booth prior to the accident. They 
were trying to put the roof on it, 
said Hunter Payne, a brother at 
Delta Upsilon (DU) fraternity 
who was working on his own booth 
next to AEPis, [The booth] was 
too lopsided.
Katie Stannard witnessed the 
incident. They were putting the 
top on and the whole thing col
lapsed, she said.
Its too bad this had to happen 
so close to Carnival, said 
ShankaraSarvendram, a brother 
at DU.
Sgt. William Ricci of Campus 
Police said that there were a total 
of three injuries reported and all 
were minor.
They were sent to Presbyterian 
Hospital as a precautionary ac
tion. They returned later that 
day.
The booth was designed simi
larly to the water tower seen in 
the Animaniacs cartoon series. 
Patrons go up a flight of stairs 
into the tower and play the game 
and exit the booth via another 
stairway.
Jeffrey Burns, the booth chair, 
said that the booth was structur
ally sound. Following the inci
dent, the Midway was filled with
members of the media, EMS, and 
Campus Police.
CMU President Robert 
Mehrabian came to the scene to 
find out what happened. I 
wanted to make sure that our 
students are alright, he said.
The booth fell into Beta Theta 
Pis booth area, but Betas booth 
had not been installed, so no dam
age was done.
After AEPi discovered their 
brothers were fine, they began 
work on repairing the booth. They 
started around 7 pm. We worked 
24 hours a day until Midway 
opened at 5 pm, said Burns. The 
Carnival Committee was very 
generous and gave us four extra 
hours of down time. The booth 
was operational by 6 pm, Friday 
evening. The booth held up 
throughout Carnival.

2The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  10 April 1995
House passes tax cuts; 
Clinton promises veto
WASHINGTON, April6 (DJ)The 
House of Representatives approved a 
$189 billion tax-cut package, ending 
Speaker Newt Gingrichs 100-day 
march through the Contract with 
America.
The bill would cut taxes for working 
families, investors, and the business 
community, drawing distinctions be
tween the Republican and Democratic 
parties that will likely resonate 
through the 1996 Presidential cam
paign.
Democrats futilely derided the pack
age as a replay of the 1981 tax act that 
sent the U.S. deficit soaring for a dec
ade. However, with Republicans uni
fied and defiant under Gingrichs lead
ership, Democrats were in no position 
to steal the crowning jewel of the 
Contract with America.
The bill would be financed over the 
next five years with cuts in domestic 
programs but would would add tens of 
billions of dollars to the deficit over a 
10-year period.
The largest piece of the package 
would provide a tax credit of $500 per 
child for families with annual incomes 
up to $200,000. The bill, among other 
things, would create a new tax-pre
ferred retirement account, cut payroll 
taxes for senior citizens, and reduce 
the top capital gains tax for individual 
investors to 19.5 percent from 28 per
cent.
For businesses, the bill would lower 
the top capital gains tax to 25 percent 
from 35 percent, establish more favor
able write-off schedules for capital in
vestments, and repeal the corporate 
minimum tax.
President Clinton marked the end of 
the first 100 days of the Republican 
Congress by detailing which items from 
the House Republican contract hell 
veto.
In a speech to the American Society 
of Newspaper Editors, he said that the 
House version of the congressional tax 
cut bill would be vetoed unless it is 
backed by about two-thirds of Con
gress.
Clinton also waved the veto weapon 
against elements of the House Repub
licans regulatory reform bill and some 
aspects of the reform legislation.
In particular, he said he opposed a 
move by Republicans to compensate 
property owners for property taken 
from them by the government for pub
lic or environmental purposes.
The statement was a major attempt 
by the President to make known where 
he stands on the GOP Contract at a 
time when Republicans are expected 
to claim overall victory in their effort 
to reform the size and scope of the 
federal government.
Clinton also indicated that he would 
support budget cutbacks outlined in a 
Senate $16 billion package passed by 
overwhelming bipartisan majority 
yesterday. On the Republican tax cut 
bill, Clinton said the revenue reduc
tions would amount to $200 billion. He 
said the measure was a fantasy. Its 
not going to happen.
However, he indicated that it would 
be acceptable if the cut amounted to 
about a third of the $200 billion. His 
own administrations tax cut proposal, 
featuring savings incentives for edu
cation, would cost about $60 billion.
Forest fire burns 
19,800 acres
OCEAN TOWNSHIP, NJ April 5 (DJ) 
A forest fire pushed by winds through 
the rain-starved Pinelands flared up 
again this morning a few miles west of 
the Waretown section of this southeast
ern New Jersey town, but did not imme
diately threaten any homes, officials said.
The front of the fire was burning close 
to a landfill along New Jerseys Route 
532, and firefighters were concentrating 
their efforts there. The fire had con
sumed 19,800 acres by midday, said 
Dave Harrison, chief of the state Forest 
Fire Service.
Harrison said the fire was of suspi
cious origin, but officials were not yet 
sure if arson was involved.
Harrison said the fire was close to 
being contained - that is, its growth 
stopped by firefighters.
Larry Leonard, chief of Waretown 
Volunteer Fire Co. No. 1, said it was 
contained, but not under control. Route 
532 was closed from the Garden State 
Parkway to Route 72.
Some parts of the fire are likely to 
continue burning until it rains, but 
firefighters hope to have it under control 
by this evening, Harrison said.
If we can hold our control lines, there 
will be no additional damage, said 
Harrison. No people or buildings were 
threatened as of midday, he said.
Were still looking at wind and dry 
weather, Bill Edwards, section warden 
with the New Jersey Forest Fire Ser
vice, said this morning.
The fire began shortly after noon yes
terday in a state wildlife preserve and 
spread rapidly to the west and then 
south through miles of the Pinelands, a 
1-1/2 million-acre region of forest dotted 
with pockets of housing and other devel
opment.
The fire threatened homes, forced the
evacuation of a few hundred people and 
animals, and sent huge plumes of bluegrey smoke hundreds of feet into the sky 
that could be seen more than a dozen 
miles away.
No damage to homes and no injuries 
were reported.
Fighting resumes 
near Sarajevo
SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
April 7 (DJ)  Following a request last 
night by French peacekeepers near 
Sarajevo for two NATO warplanes to 
buzz Serb positions in a show of force, 
Bosnian Serbs shelled a Sarajevo sub
urb for the second straight day.
The Serbs also closed all checkpoints 
into Sarajevo and threatened to shoot 
down U.N. helicopters flying over their 
territory.
State radio reported that four people 
were killed and 10 wounded in the latest 
round of shelling. All sides have refused 
to extend a cease-fire, which continues 
until May 1.
The peacekeepers said they were try
ing to halt attacks on the only civilian 
access route into Sarajevo, which crosses 
Mount Igman. Serbs reportedly kept fir
ing even after the NATO show of force, 
targeting the U.N. post with two mortar 
shells which landed nearby.
An estimated200,000 people have died 
or disappeared since war began in April 
1992 with a Serb revolt against Bosnias 
decision to become independent from 
Serb-led Yugoslavia.
Guilty verdict 
given to gunman
WASHINGTON, April 4 (DJ)  A 
federal jury today convicted Francisco 
Martin Duran of trying to assassinate 
President Clinton, rejecting arguments 
that he was insane when he fired a
semiautomatic rifle at the White Hou$ 
last fall.
Duran also was convicted of assault 
ing four Secret Service officers, unlan. 
fully possessing a rifle and a shotgu 
damaging federal property, using 
weapon during a crime of violence an 
transporting a firearm across state line 
with the intention to kill the President
After waiting outside the White Houa 
for hours on October 29, Duran suj. 
denly pulled the weapon from under hij 
trench coat and sprayed the front of tl* 
executive mansion with nearly 30 bu] 
lets. No one was hurt.
President Clinton was inside the Whit! 
Houses family quarters at the tint 
watching a Saturday afternoon football 
game. The Secret Service said the Presdent never was in any danger.
Former UWA 
head found guilty

Nobel Prize winner 
speaks to students

Clifford Shull talked to students from the Mellon College of Science and Schenley 
High School on Thursday. Shull is a Nobel Prize winner and alumnus of CMU.
By EDWARD HAYES
Tartan News Editor
Clifford Shull, a Nobel Prize winner in physics, visited students this week. 
Shull graduated from Carnegie Mellon in 1937 and received the Nobel Prize in
1994.
Shulls talk was held in the Mellon Institute Auditorium and was open to all 
students. On Wednesday, April 5, Shull presented his talk entitled Early 
Development of Neutron Diffraction. There was a reception that followed the 
[talk. On .Thursday; Shull talked with MCS students as well as Schenley High 
'School students (Shull graduated from Schenley High) about his career. This 
ievent was held in Wean Hall 7500.
It was a family affair, since Shulls son Robert also spoke in Wean Hall. 
Robert gave a talk on Magnetic Application of Nanocomposite Materials. 
Robert is a scientist at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. 
This talk was open to the public and was followed by a reception.
Carnival demands security
By GEL ALTEROVITZ
Tartan Staffwriter
Due to the demolition of Skibo, this 
years Spring Carnival was held in the 
Morewood Gardens parking lot. As a 
result, those students, staff, and faculty 
who had parking permits in this lot were 
displaced.
This called for some ----------------------
kind of strategy to deal 
with these displaced 
cars during the week 
of preperation for 
Spring Carnival and 
for the actual Carni
val itself.
Beverly Stoughton, 
acting manager for 
Special Projects/Dis
tribution/Parking Ser
vices said, Between 
the parking office and 
Spring Carnival, we checked every single 
lot within a two mile radius of campus 
to rent parking, to get parking for the 
permit holder. However, no off-campus 
parking options were found.
James LaPaglia, director of Campus 
Police, mentioned that one alternative 
considered was parking on Forbes Av
enue. I recommended that we try to 
avoid that because that causes a great 
deal of inconvenience to the commuting 
public and the community that we are 
in, said LaPaglia. [In the past] it didnt 
put us in good eyes with the public. It 
was a security hazard [and] a safety 
hazard.
At the end, valet parking was selected 
to allow for denser parking at Morewood 
and on the roof of the parking garage. 
The 81/2" by 11" News said Jay Becker 
Parking Services was hired to provide 
these services between 6 am and 5:30
pm from Monday through Friday of last 
week. Stoughton said that This year, 
weve displaced approximately 279 [driv
ers], and weve inconvenienced a heck of 
a lot more .... Last year, we displaced 
approximately (for the whole week) 130 
[cars]. She estimated that the valet 
services allowed for 50 percent more 
cars to be parked in a given area when
The one thing that weve never done 
before ... is reserve almost every visitor 
space on campus for alumni. 
 Beverly Stoughton, acting manager 
for Parking Services
compared to unassisted parking by mo
torists.
In addition to the loss of the Skibo lots, 
Stoughton said, The one thing that weve 
never done before that weve done this 
year is weve reserved almost every visi
tor space on campus for alumni: about 
119 spaces.
She estimates that about 75 percent 
of these spots were actually used by 
alumni.
While accommodating parking needs 
proved to be harder this year as more 
cars were displaced, LaPaglia saw ad
vantages to the Midway location in terms 
of potential for better security. We dont 
know exactly how its going to pan out. I 
think its going to be much better from 
the security point of view.
LaPaglia said that last year there was 
a robbery at the kiddy rides near Warner 
Hall. One of the reasons they could do
that was because Warner Hall was iso
lated from everything else that was at ] 
Skibo.
Here everything is together. Midway - 
is a much better setup from the environmental point of view when it comes to " 
safety and security here.
A security plan to patrol the Midway 
area was devised by dividing the area
-------------------- into different sectors. In
addition, LaPaglia 
noted that, If we need 
to, we can go up into 
Warner Hall and get an 
overall picture of the 
crowd and see how 
things look from there. 
He said that the pri
mary security concerns 
included underage 
drinking in isolated armfeMjgMB/nviittiiTun'i eas anc^ preventing damage or disturbance 
to the nearby residential community 
such as residents on Devonshire Drive.
In addition, LaPaglia said, We are 
going to have to keep an eye on 
[Morewood dining area]... [and we also] 
dont want to have any outsiders coming 
into our residential areas.
Since the Skibo lots will not be avail
able with the construction of the new 
University Center, the question of where 
the permanent home of Spring Carnival 
will be in the future still remains unan
swered.
However, LaPaglia said, From all 
indications, it seems to me that the best 
place to have it [is Morewood Gardens 
parking lot], especially since we will 
have experience there this year, and 
they are doing things like putting the 
electrical leads to this area. So some of 
the things that they are doing work for 
this year will be in place for next year.
Controversy surrounds electionStudent Senate Minutes
RESULTS, from page 1
mentioned one female student, 
a quotation by a male stu
dent. The quotation was sexual 
in nature, and was found by many 
to be offensive.
The plan file, which was.erased 
shortly after being posted, said, 
ley Meredith... SUCK ASS. It 
then went on to give a quotation 
from a student whose name has 
been omitted. The quotation read, 
When those legs are spread re
ally wide and its moist and juicy
such bboards as cmu.student.government. Several Senators cited 
lack of professionalism and called 
his character into question. 
Schimmel answered with a letter 
of apology saying that the commentwas a private joke between 
him and a friend. Schimmel also 
said he wrote the comment to 
complete his CSW assignment 
and said, I never realized that it 
was permanently placed in my... 
public... plan file.
Debate over Schimmel through
entire situation. I think its dis
appointing that a lot of people 
have judged him on grounds of 
the plan file, he said. I think it 
was blown way out of propor
tion. Before he ran for the posi
tion, Studarus sent email to 
Schimmel asking him if he was 
serious about running. If so, 
Studarus advised him to change 
the plan file.
Schuyler was also disappointed 
with the controversy. I dont 
think that it was pertinent to the 
election, she said.

The Vagina Monologues are a series of performance monologues in development. 
Each one is loosely based on interviews with women about their vaginas. At first 
women are a little reluctant, a little shy to talk about their vaginas. But once they 
begin, they dont want to stop. Women love to talk about their vaginas, probably 
because no one has ever asked before. The Vagina Monologues are an attempt to 
make vaginas visible, connected, alive, available, empowered and heard.

Crime and Incident Reports
3/17 SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY, 2:01 
-jn. Campus Police received a call that a 
ffhite male, wearing all black and an 
upside-down cross around his neck, was 
Rowing a knife into some wood in the 
basement of Scobell Hall. Officers reinded to the basement of Scobell, but 
und no one matching that description, 
jjhe board that was used for the knife 
Rowing was brought to the Communi
cations Desk in the Student Center.
3/26 THEFT, 9:46 pm. The victim 
ailed Campus Police stating that while 
he and her boyfriend were out at din
ner, someone broke into her boyfriends 
jar and stole several items. She told an 
officer that while they were in the Sushi 
[flm Restaurant, someone broke the rear 
window of her boyfriends car, which 
ffas parked on Penn Avenue. A carry-on 
uitcase was stolen from the car, which 
contained her CMU Student ID, the key 
o her apartment, several credit cards, 
her checkbook, all of which was 
valued at about $600. Her boyfriends 
black leather jacket, valued at $300, was 
also taken.
3/27 GAS LEAK, 9:37 pm. Officers 
reported to Baker Hall for a report of a 
possible gas leak. A representative of 
Instructional Technology said that there 
a strong smell around Baker 229. 
Baker and Porter Halls were checked on 
all floors, but the smell was located en
tirely between 229 Baker and Porter 
217. The windows and doors of the class
rooms were opened, and the smell dissitated after about twenty minutes.
3/30 INDECENT EXPOSURE, 11:19
pm. The dispatcher received a call that a 
, had exposed himself to a female 
student. The victim said that the sus
pect was a black male, wearing a dark 
plaid shirt, dark jeans, and possibly 
rearing glasses. At 11:23 pm, an officer 
saw a suspect who closely fit the descrip
tion on the Bureau of Mines Road near
Hamburg Hall walking towards Forbes 
Avenue. This person was wearing a large 
beret - type cap. Upon seeing the police 
car, he hurriedly changed direction and 
went down the steps at Physical Plant. 
At 11:25 pm, an ABM custodian told the 
responding officers that he had just seen 
the suspect enter the first floor door of 
Wean Hall and enter the stairway. Of
ficers checked Wean, Doherty, the Cut, 
and Frew Street, but the man could not 
be found. The victim said that she first 
noticed the suspect at about 11 pm while 
on the fourth floor of Hunt Library. The 
suspect smiled at her when she glanced 
at him. She then left the fourth floor and 
went to the basement. While she was 
riding the elevator back to the fourth 
floor, the car stopped at three and the 
man entered the elevator and rode to 
four with her. At about 11:15 pm, she 
was looking through books on the lower 
shelves of a stack, and when she looked 
up, the suspect was standing about five 
feet away, his pants were pulled down, 
and he was masturbating. The victim 
hurriedly went to her desk and got her 
books.
3/30 BUGGY CONFRONTATION,
12:23 am. The victim called Campus 
Police and said that he had a confronta
tion with a buggy flag man at the road 
block at Scaife Hall. He said he was 
leaving Parking Area #11 to go home 
when he encountered a road block at 
Scaife Hall. He said that buggy people 
had the whole road closed; they would 
not let him go by, and he did not under
stand why they needed the whole road. 
They told him to turn off his headlights 
and were using profanity and being rude. 
Finally, when he was allowed to pro
ceed, he turned on his headlights and 
was again yelled at with profanity. One 
of the buggy people threw a screwdriver 
at his car, causing a dent. The victim 
stopped, picked up the screwdriver, and 
drove off, all the while being yelled at by 
buggy people. Campus Police explained
the necessity of motorists to honor the 
road blocks and the need for motorists to 
dim their lights. A witness later told 
Campus Police that the buggy people 
were overzealous and corroborated the 
victims account. An officer spoke to a 
buggy flag man, who said that while on 
the Bureau of Mines Road by Scaife Hall 
Auditorium, a vehicle approached Frew 
Street and demanded to be let out to go 
home.
He asked the driver to turn off his 
lights, and they would open the hill as 
soon as possible to let him out. The 
vehicle tried to go around the flag man, 
who stepped in front of the vehicle and 
was hit. At this time, a large crowd of 
students gathered around the car so 
that it could not move.
3/30 CRIMINAL MISCHIEF, 11:24 
am. A complainant stated that between
3 am and 8 am, person(s) unknown en
tered the Math Department kitchen area 
and threw coffee cream and barbecue 
sauce all over the walls and floors. The 
table in this area also had vast amounts 
of garbage strewn on it. ABM was noti
fied for a clean-up of the area.
The Tartan prints the weekly Crime 
and Incident report under the following

gal canons regardless of stated pur
pose of the news group. It goes on to 
state, on the practical side, that groups 
that do not have a specific owner may 
be refused access to the newsgroup. An 
example of this are, groups that are 
clearly frivolous in nature or repeat 
the same name over and over as does 
alt.barney.die.die.die. There are also 
many other terms listed in the pro
posal.
The whole situation began back in 
November when the University an
nounced it would censor all sexually 
explicit bboards. There was an imme
diate response from the campus com
munity against the decision.
The Senate passed a resolution at
tacking the idea, and the Faculty Sen
ate unanimously passed a resolution 
also condemning the action.
The following week, CMU President, 
Robert Mehrabian, formed the bboard 
committee to discuss the issue and 
come up with a proposal. The board 
was made up of faculty, staff, and 
students. However, only two students 
served on the committee, the Student 
Body President, and the president of 
the Graduate Student Organization. 
Erwin Steinberg, the vice provost of 
Education, as well as a professor in 
the English Department, chair the 
committee which included the chair
man of the Faculty Senate, the vice 
chairman of the Educational Affairs 
Committee, the chairman of the Staff 
Council, and a Staff Council member. 
There are also five ex-officio members 
of the committee: Barbara Smith, as
sistant vice president for Human Re
sources, Charles Lowry, a University 
Librarian, William Arms, the former 
vice president for Computing Services, 
Jackie Koscelnik, legal counsel, and 
Dean of Student Affairs, Michael 
Murphy.
proposal community
The draft of the policy statement is 
posted on both graffitti.bboard-censorship and cmu.student.government. 
Both Steinberg and Kamela White, 
Student Body President, and voting 
members of the committee, are inter
ested in hearing feedback. White said, 
There has been discussion to hold an 
open meeting in a few weeks for people 
to voice their opinions and concerns. 
However, there has already been feed
back to the proposal by individuals and 
also by the Coalition for Academic Free
dom of Expression (CAFE). The re
sponses were posted on the censorship 
bboard. CAFE, among other things, 
believes that the legality statement 
should be revised, stating that it is 
impossible for a news group to be 
illegal based purely onits name; there
fore any decision about the legality of a 
news group should be based strictly on 
its content. CAFEs proposal recom
mends using at least 50 posts to deter
mine if a news group meets the criteria 
for illegality.
Others have problems with the same 
issues, judging from the posts to the 
censorship bboard made in response to 
the proposal. Jeremiah Blatz wrote 
that, If a news group has a mix of 
obscene and non-obscene posts, then 
the news group as a whole may not be 
declared obscene and is thus not at all 
illegal to carry.
Steinberg said that there is no way in 
which to come up with a proposal in 
which some portion of the campus will 
not be unhappy.
But he said he will listen to sugges
tions and wants to give the proposal a 
wide exposure. He is looking forward 
to the open session where copies of the 
proposal will be available.

FORUM

Campus apathy harms 
proper representation
It is unfortunate that so few 
students at this University show 
interest in leading the student 
body  one would think 
Carnegie Mellon students would 
jump at the chance to make a 
difference in campus affairs. 
Sadly, this isnt the case. Year 
after year, very few students 
apply to be put on the ballot for 
Student Body President or Stu
dent Senate.
In fact, no students met 
Senates petition deadline this 
year, thus no students were of
ficially on the ballot. Why 
have students at this university 
rejected opportunities for lead
ership  especially when most 
of them have had some prior 
experience? It seems that this 
trend can be chalked up to more 
than an apathetic attitude.
Most students consider them
selves too busy to vote in the 
presidential election, thus run
ning for office seems out of the 
question. Only 6.5 percent of 
the campus community voted in 
the election held April 6, 7 and 
8. Perhaps Carnival wasnt the 
best time to hold elections. Such 
a low turnout also seems to indi
cate that students have little 
interest or understanding in the 
operations of student govern
ment. The elections were wellpublicized, yet students ne
glected to vote.
It seems most students here 
dont wish to commit themselves 
to activities outside of their aca
demic curriculum. Some depart
ments, such as drama, even encourage students to focus only 
on their coursework and not 
extend themselves to extra 
curriculars such as the Greek 
system, or student clubs. They 
are told they will not have time 
for such projects.
However, students in general 
often seem convinced that they 
have no time for outside com
mitments and tend to shy away 
from clubs and other social or
ganizations. Im too busy, or 
Im overloading, are commonly-heard excuses for not 
getting involved. Such claims 
dont allow for students of dif
ferent colleges to be represented. 
While any student can attest to 
the high stress environment 
here, it seems our community 
could be enriched if more of us 
participated in the decision mak
ing.
It seems like a CMU tradition 
for students to complain about 
their workload, the administra
tion, Dining Services, etc. The 
only way for this pessimistic 
attitude to change is for stu
dents to get directly involved in 
the process of improvement; 
apathy will not make our uni
versity community more effec
tive or fun to attend.
Students need to realize that 
they can have an impact on sat
isfaction  there are a lot of 
good ideas out there and a lot of 
experienced, motivated stu
dents. The campus community 
could be a more open environ
ment if students spent some 
time contributing to it.
Excessive competition 
detracts from Carnival
Booth by day, buggy by night 
and academics in the fall, said 
Jon Scott Breult, a Phi Kappa 
Theta brother, in the 1995 
Sweepstakes booklet. Has Car
nival competition gotten out of 
control? Or, do the Pi Kappa 
Alpha buggy winners who 
shouted, Competition makes us 
strong, to the Sweepstakes 
crowd have the right attitude?
CMU is extremely competitive 
by nature, and the Booth and 
Buggy competitions are no ex
ception. Buggy training begins 
as early as the fall and thou
sands of dollars are spent build
ing new buggies and fine-tuning old ones. Each year as Car
nival draws nearer, buggy push
ers train religiously  pushing 
aside homework, exams and 
sleep, all for a couple of three 
minute races.
This high pressure training 
can have serious ramifications. 
The pusher may step out of the 
lane. The buggy fails the brake 
test. Someone messes up. People 
cheer when a buggy crashes. 
They hope the rival team will 
spin out. This is when Buggy 
goes beyond friendly competi
tion and creates hostility be
tween organizations.
This negative side of competi
tion is not only seen in buggy 
races. When Alpha Epsilon Pis 
booth collapsed, did other orga
nizations run to their aid? Did 
they help them rebuild? Did they
offer support? Each organiza
tion was so caught up in their 
own booth, and its perfection, 
that while the paramedics were 
aiding the injured brothers, the 
sound of hammering did not 
stop.
Organizations go to all lengths 
to win. Its ridiculous the amount 
of money some spend to have 
the fastest buggy and best booth. 
Also because of cost and compe
tition, some of the materials are 
not always acquired in the most 
legal fashion.
All-nighters are a part of booth, 
and buggy people wake up at 
the crack of dawn to practice. It 
seems CMUs work ethic car
ries carries over even into Car
nival. Spring Carnival is the 
one time of the year when stu
dents are given some time off to 
relax. We should use this time 
to unite the campus, not split 
ourselves apart through selfish 
competition.
We praise all the organiza
tions which complimented their 
competitors and kept up the 
spirit of friendly competition. It 
was a pleasant change from the 
unconfortable incidents sur
rounding last years buggy races 
and award ceremonies. Carni
val should be viewed as a time 
for fun and celebration  not 
mean-spirited competition. It is 
an opportunity for students to 
spend quality time with mem
bers of their organization.

A while back I had a discussion with a 
friend of a differing political persuasion. 
It proved to be quite revealing as to how 
those of a liberal perspective can justify 
much of their world view. He was con
vinced that the economy was a zero sum 
game. Of course, I had 
to disagree vehemently, 
and in the end I think I 
got him to change his 
perspective, if only a 
little bit.
Now it behooves me to 
define zero sum game 
for you folks, or Id be 
blathering on pointlessly (though Ill bet 
theres a bunch out there whod say I do 
that anyway). A zero sum game is one in 
which there is a loser and a winner. This 
is like a poker game in which there is 
only so much money in the pot and for 
you to make a killing, other people have 
to come out in the hole.
Democrats have always seemed to 
thrive on the notion that all of life is a 
zero sum game, where for you to make 
money, somebody has to lose money. 
They believe that federal revenues are a 
static system where a tax increase will 
always generate revenue and tax cuts 
will always reduce receipts. They some
how have even gotten to the point where 
rights are a zero sum game and that you 
have to take away peoples rights to give 
some to others.
This is a truly twisted and sad world 
view. It is an admission of defeat. It says 
that life cant get better. Things cant 
progress, and the best we can do is disDemocrats have always seemed to 
thrive on the notion that all of life is a 
zero sum game, where for you to make 
money, somebody has to lose money.
You have a newspaper which I wish to 
read. I have money which you wish to 
use for other things.
We trade them and both of us come 
away from the transaction happier than
tribute what we have in a more equibefore. Happiness has been created MSE who has had to zero some games.
Excessive alcohol use continues
across the floor on Sunday morning, too drunk from the 
previous night to make it back to their rooms. I also saw 
fraternity boys carry girls back to their dorm, because they got 
too drunk to walk or find their way back. If thats your id 
of a good time, so be it. But when your idea of a good time 
means getting wasted and trashing public property, the 
lounges and halls of dorms that we pay so much money to live 
in, its destructive, irresponsible, and just plain stupid. And 
what of self-destructive behavior?
The saddest scene I stumbled onto during freshman orien
tation was on the steps outside of old Skibo a fellow 
classmate intoxicated, blood spilling from his cracked head, 
laying on the ground. Classes hadnt even started yet and he 
already paid a visit to the hospital and made friends with 
Campus Police.
A large part of the college experience is what we learn 
outside of the classroom, too. A student on our campus died 
from blood alcohol poisoning not too long ago, a tragedy that 
has reminded me of the fragility of life.
Although his death came as a shock, it could have been 
avoided. Yet it seems that many students have not contem
plated the impact or the seriousness of this tragic event, s 
continue in their pattern of excessive alcohol consumptionWhy?
We are not children anymore, we are bright, intelligent 
people, working toward our education and our future. Relax, 
have fun, and be responsible. As Justin Chambers learned the 
hard way, you may not get a second chance.

Not tonight, good Iago, I have very poor and unhappy

 Cassio to Iago in William Shakespeares Othello
A healthy diversion from work is a necessity, especially in 
the challenging and demanding work environment that we, 
as students, live in. We all feel the tension as projects, papers, 
presentations, and labs, among other things, weigh us down. 
Fortunately, theres always the weekend to catch up with 
friends, with sleep, and sometimes, even more work.
While there is no single best way to spend the weekend. A 
myth among students is that, aside from drinking, there is 
nothing better to do. Everyone has their own way of relaxing, 
their own idea of fun ... thats great, and it makes life 
interesting. Unfortunately, what I saw all too often while I 
lived in Morewood Gardens, was students sprawled out

Reading series deserves more attention
Andrew Sproule
Is anyone else bothered by the 
fact that CMU has such a high 
academic reputation but. its stu
dents only seem to get enthusias
tic once a year? For something so 
non-academic? The main thrill of 
the whole year is building poor 
replicas of houses and thrusting 
phallic symbols through some
thing called a Chute. There is a 
certain joy during Carnival that 
I am not trying to diminish, nor 
take away; however, it is bother
some that students dont get as 
excited about other things that 
CMU has to offer.
The main event, or series, that
I am referring to is the English 
departments reading series. Ev
ery year, the department brings 
in nationally-known writers  
poets, novelists  to read from 
their work. On a campus of 
roughly 4,000, these readings
rarely draw _______________
more than 
50 people.
Sure, its 
hard to 
compare 
great lit
erature to 
little mod
els of male 
genitalia on 
wheels
with little people inside of them 
being pushed around a track, but 
it still seems odd. Even more odd, 
is that of the students who are 
writing majors, the majority of 
them dont go to these readings. 
And many professors even require 
these students to go.
So, what can be done? Its not 
an easy answer, because having 
seen students behavior for three 
years, I dont think the situation 
is likely to change. If only a 
miracle could change attitudes 
overnight. Therefore, the only
up to the public. What does this 
solve? Nothing sells better than 
exclusiveness.
Im convinced that nobody 
would be clamoring to join coun
try clubs if they let any old slob 
join. Would the Fortune 500 carry
On a campus of roughly 4,000, these readings 
rarely draw more than 50 people. Sure, its hard 
to compare great literature to little models of 
male genitalia on wheels with little people inside 
of them being pushed around a track...
answer seems to be a complete 
revamping of the program. The 
only way that seems plausible is 
by making the reading series ex
clusive to writing majors. The 
department should still bring the 
writers in, but have them read in 
writing classes and dont open it
the same esteem if it were the 
Fortune Any-Company-ThatDidnt-Go-Bust? No. The English 
students would still be getting 
exposed to thesewriters and prob
ably even more so because the 
readings would take place dur
ing class periods. The English
department would still have its 
reading series.
Nothing would be lost, and 
soon, after the students started

writers were, the campus as a 
whole might become more inter

Then again, maybe this idea 
wouldnt work. Maybe students 
at CMU are too wrapped up in 
other things for any idea to work

to get a woman inside a penis.

While most of the CMU student body 
traveled all over the country to those 
strange, faraway locales known as 
beaches, I thought it would be a good 
idea to stay here during Spring Break and 
put in a few extra work hours at the E&S 
Library. After all, it would only be about a 
week and a half before school started, and 
it would be nice to have the money and 
extra quiet time.

Pub crawls (barhopping) entertain students in Australia
Eric Salzman
I wanna know why Australians 
resent Americans so much. For a 
friendly nation, Australia cer
tainly has a lot of sarcasm in 
store for American visitors.
How many American ex
change students does it take to 
screw in a light bulb? one clever 
Australian asked me. One, but 
they keep sending us more anyway, he answered.
People here have lots of rent-o 
witticisms like that. They like to 
make fun of Americans Funky 
Jesus sandals, our obnoxious 
manner, and our pathetic at
tempts at amusement through 
drinking games (by the way, chug
ging here is called skulling, be
cause people turn the glass over 
on top of their head once its 
empty).
During the Study Abroad Ori
entation Pub Crawl, we Ameri
cans were not exactly welcome 
everywhere. A pub crawl is simi
lar to the American version of bar 
hopping, only its more organized. 
Imagine 250 people going from
bar to bar for half a hour at a 
time, and exiting to the sound of 
a whistle.
The Study Abroad Pub Crawl 
was limited to eight bars in four 
hours. Each person was expected 
to purchase a souvenir of an am
ber and liquid-nature drink at 
each bar. Two hundred and fifty 
American college students 
packed into a bar made for 200 
inspired one perturbed Austra
lian woman to yell, Come on and 
blow the bloody whistle already!
Perhaps Australian students 
are more welcome on their pub 
crawls. The freshman dorms in 
the colleges start at 2 pm and go 
until theyve hit 18 differentpubs.
Yes, this extraordinary event is a 
fully-recognized orientation week 
event. Maybe CMU should add 
something similar to its fresh
man orientation. Well, its not 
likely....
Despite the overly friendly 
woman I noticed during the pub 
crawl, most Australians just want 
to take the piss out of us. For 
every person who wants to see 
how much humor Americans 
can take, there is another who 
wants to say hi.
WARNING: When riding the 
bus, it can be dangerous for an 
American to speak. Once the ac
cent is out, the Australian will 
want to hear all about the states
and tell you all about Australia 
within three stops. Or, another 
Australian, usually in the 50-75 
age range, will want to know if 
you have any friends in common. 
Either way, youre in for an earfull.
Eric Salzman, a sophomore 
philosophy major studying 
abroad in Australia, is waiting 
for a letter or two. He had gotten 
the least amount of mail of all his 
house mates, and knows that 
CMU wont let him down. His 
address is: 74 Perouse Rd., 
Randwick NSW 2031, Austra
lia. Please write! Hes alone with 
the kangaroos.

Track team hosts annual invitational
Mens tennis wins, women drop two in the past week
By SUDHIR REDDY
Tartan Staffwriter
The mens and womens tennis teams 
continue their march to the UAATennis 
Championships hosted by Emory Uni
versity in Atlanta.
The mens team defeated Gettysburg 
on the road April 2 while the womens 
team lost. The womens team also lost to 
Allegheny the next day.
Going into the Supersport Tourna
ment at Penn State this past Saturday, 
the mens record was nine wins and six 
losses, and the womens record was six 
wins and 14 losses.
The mens number-two seed Navrose 
Marshall, a freshman, said that the team 
didnt play up to its full potential be
cause of all the distractions. The 
weather wasnt good. It really got to me; 
sometimes Id be freezing but once I put 
on my sweatshirt Id be too hot.
Marshall said that another distrac
tion was the factor of playing indoors. 
Because the tennis teams do not usually 
Practice inside, they have a difficult time 
with the faster surface.
We dont have big servers so playing 
indoors was real tough, said Marshall. 
Despite the distractions, Marshall won 
his match in three sets (6-1, 6-7(4), 
6-0).
Other winners for the men included 
masters student John Muza (7-6 (5), 6- 
4), senior Mike Mace-donia (6-3,3-6,6- 
2), freshman Dan Bilco 
(3-6, 6-3, 6-4), and 
sophomore Iroro Orife 
(6-4, 6-4). However, 
freshman Jim Freese 
lost 60, 62.
The doubles team of 
Muza and senior Bill 
Mathey won 8-4. How
ever, the FreeseMarshall team lost 8-5, 
and the MacedoniaBilco duo lost 9-8 (2).
Marshall said, Our number two 
doubles team is great but our number 
one [team] and number three [team] 
need some touching up.
The womens team did not have as 
much success as the mens team mainly 
due to their youth and that the fact that
three key players werent playing, jun
ior Namita Amin, freshman Jackie 
Auteri, and freshman Natalie Lee.
The teams number one player, 
Stephanie Kukur a, a senior, said, I think 
this season has been a lot tougher [mainly 
because the team is so young]. The 
team lost 7-2, but Kukura won her
match.
She [her opponent] was hitting a lot 
of winners and had a 6-2, 4-1 lead on 
me, said Kukura. However, she hung 
tough and won the match (2-6, 6-4, 
6-3).
Other womens singles players were
junior Miriam Huang, sophomore 
Michelle Cook, sophomore May Lee, 
sophomore Michelle Majikes, and fresh
man Sarah Frew.
In doubles, the duo of Kukura and 
Huang won 9-7. However, Cook and 
Frew lost 8-0 and the Lee-Majikes team 
lost 8-4.
The womens team 
played Allegheny the 
next day. Weather dis
tractions also plagued 
the teams play. The 
team had to play with
out Kukura and under 
poor conditions. It was 
windy and rainy and the 
courts with cracks and 
pothole. They were 
swept 7-0.
Amin, the teams num
ber-two player, said that her match was 
difficult and the weather may have 
played a role in her performance.
In the singles matches, Amin, Huang, 
Cook, Auterie, Natalie Lee, and May 
Lee all lost in straight sets.
The doubles teams of Amin-Huang
and Cook-Auteri also lost.
Players on both teams agree that there 
is little intra-squad competition. Accord
ing to Macedonia, players are very coop
erative and supportive of each other and 
they are all looking to benefit the team.
Were a close unit. Our team consists 
of three seniors and three freshmen and 
the seniors are very supportive, said 
Marshall.
Kukura agreed. Theres friendly com
petition on the team, but there isnt 
animosity. Everyones happy with their 
positions, and they play for fun, she 
said.
Both teams also agree that their should 
be indoor courts. Kukura said, Playing 
once a week [in the winter] just doesnt 
cut it.
Marshall agree saying the nearest 
available indoor courts can sometimes 
be 40 to 45 minutes away. Indoor courts 
would be an incredible help, he said.
The mens team will play at Washing
ton and Jefferson College on April 11. 
Both teams will travel to Emory Univer
sity the weekend of April 21-23.
"Theres friendly competition on the 
team, but there isnt animosity. Every
one is happy with their positions, and 
they play for fun.

Practice makes perfect
By STEVEN BURNS
Tartan Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon mens and 
womens track teams held their 
annual invitational on Sunday. 
Twenty teams from five states 
traveled here to participate. The 
competition was stiff as two sta
dium and six invitational records 
fell and seven people became pro
visional qualifiers for the NCAA 
Division III championships. The 
meet also featured an automatic 
qualifier for the NCAA Division 
III championships as John 
Lischner of Thiel College threw 
the javelin a distance of 63.18 
meters (207 feet, 3 inches).
The weather didnt cooperate 
which made for poor competing 
conditions. It also caused the can
cellation of some of the field 
events.
Team scores were not kept dur
ing the meet. The competition 
was on an individual event basis 
with multiple heats run. The first 
heat winners were the official 
winners.
Both of the Tartan track teams 
came into the meet hungry. This 
is one of the major meets that we 
compete in, said head coach 
Dario Donatelli. It is the best 
competition we have before the 
conference meet.
The womens team came into 
the meet off of a strong perfor
mance at the Bethany College 
Relays placing second out of five 
teams. The mens team didnt fare 
as well at Bethany placing fourth.
The Tartans finished first in 
three events and second in two 
events. They also racked up a 
number of top six finishes.
The womens team was led by 
sophomore Penny Summerville, 
who won the womens javelin with 
a throw of 40.94 meters(134 feet
4 inches). This made her a provi
sional qualifier for the NCAA 
championships. She fell just two 
inches short of an automatic 
qualifying throw.
Sophomore Becky Bucheit also 
won an event for the Tartans in 
the womens 10,000-meter race. 
She raced across the finish line 
with a time of 41:51.
The mens team showed its best 
in the mens 200-meter race. 
Freshmen Jon Voymas and Rick 
Steiner finished first and third 
respectively, while sophomore 
Buck Neel finished sixth. Voymas 
darted to the finish in a time of 
24.16 seconds, while Steiner fin
ished with a time of 24.90 sec
onds. Neel crossed the line at 
26.15 seconds.
Another standout performer for 
the Tartans was senior Jason 
Grusky. He placed second in the 
mens shot put with a distance 
was 14.78 meters.
Other strong performers in the 
field events were sophomore Jody 
Rogish and freshman Peter Hunt.
Rogish placed sixth in the mens 
javelin with a throw of 53.90 
meters. Hunt placed sixth in the 
mens high jump with a jump of 6 
feet 4 inches.
The women showed their
strength on the --------------
track. Sophomore 
Vonquitra Bebee 
placed second in the 
womens 100-meter 
dash. She came 
across the line with 
a time of 13.11 sec
onds.
Junior Missy 
Baustert gathered a 
fourth place finish in 
the womens 400- 
meters and a third place in the 
womens 400-meter intermediate 
hurdles. Her times were 62.2 sec
onds and 1:09.42 respectively.
Freshman Melissa Lott and 
sophomore Ron Polcawich also 
gave strong performances for the 
Tartans in the distance events. 
Lott finish fifth in the womens
3000-meters with a time ofl0:56. 
Polcawich finish sixth in the 
mens 3000-meter steeplechase 
with a time of 10:54.
The Tartans ended the meet on 
a positivenote as the mens 1600-

 Dario Donatelli, head coach
meter relay team took third place 
with a time of 3:30.1.
The Tartans also turned in a 
number of exceptional perfor
mances in their heats. Freshmen 
Jeff Jones and Kerry Riley each 
finished first in their respective 
heats. Jones finished first in the 
second heat of the mens 400-
meters with a time of 56.46 sec
onds. Riley finished finished first 
in the second heat of the womens 
200-meters with a time of 29.08 
seconds.
Freshman Nathan Gill took
--------------------- second place in
the third heat of 
the mens 400- 
meter interme
diate hurdles 
with a time of 
60.6 seconds.
Sophomore 
Casey Smith 
and freshman 
George Matcuk 
took third and 
fourth in the 
fourth heat of the mens 400- 
meters with times of 53.6 sec
onds and 54.45 seconds respec
tively.
The womens track team next 
sees action on Wednesday as they 
host the Tartan Invitational. Both 
teams will compete in the Pitts
burgh Relays on Sunday.

between living and living well alter your working years

Contributions to your SRAs are deducted from 
your salaiy on a pre-tax basis. That lowers your

right away. Whats more, an3> earnings on your SRAs 
are also tax-deferred until 3'ou receive them as income. 
That can make a big difference in how painful your tax

why Chabad is sponsoring Sedorim on campuses across 
America, and distributing Free Passover Seder-to-Go packages 
for Jewish students unable to attend. Three-to-four people

hand-made Shmurah matzah sample, a box of matzahs, a 
bottle of Kosher-for-Pesach grape juice and a Seder Guide 
with full instructions for making your own Seder. So whether 
you're at a family Seder or a Seder on campus, or you order 
a Seder-to-Go, don't miss your chance to join the celebration.
We'll do whatever we can to help.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  10 April 199511
The Athletic Department is looking 
for participants for the 1995 Home
coming Highlander Games, to be held 
on Saturday, October 16, during Home
coming. Four-person alumni and stu
dent teams can formally sign up in the 
but those who are interested in 
participating should reply to Lynn Stanko 
(email Is4t+).
The Penguins looked to strengthen 
the team Friday by making three deals 
at the trading deadline. Center Martin 
Straka was traded to Ottawa in ex
change for defenseman Norm Maciver 
and center Troy Murray. Also, 
defenseman Grant Jennings was sent 
to Toronto in return for defenseman 
Drake Berehowsky and minor-leaguer 
Greg Brown was traded to Winnipeg for 
a player to be named later.
In 28 games, Maciver has four goals 
and seven assists, and has shown 
great strength on the power play. Murray 
had four goals and 10 assists in 33 
games this season. General Manager 
Craig Patrick will be looking to use 
Murray to take some of the pressure off 
of center Ron Francis, who is often in 
the game for 30 minutes or more. 
Straka, the Penguins first-round draft 
choice in 1992 had four goals and 16 
points this season.
The 6'2" Berehowsky had two as
sists in 25 games. The Penguins be
lieve that Berehowsky will be an impor
tant player in the future as he develops. 
Jennings had four assists in 25 games.
Defensive back Corey Sawyer of the 
Cincinnati Bengals turned himself in on 
Tuesday after being charged with per
jury. Authorities in Leon County claim 
that Sawyer lied about taking money 
from an agent while playing for the 
Florida State Seminles. Sawyer is the 
first former Florida State player to be 
charged with a crime, although more 
than 50 players have been questioned. 
Perjury is a third-degree felony which 
has a maximum penalty of five years in 
prison.
This weekend was chaotic as majorleague baseball teams hurried to sign 
free agents before midnight deadlines. 
Among notable deals were Orel 
Hershisers move from Los Angeles to 
Cleveland, Andre Dawsons switch from 
Boston to Miami, Dave Stewarts re
turn to Oakland from Toronto, Bob 
Tewksburys move from St. Louis to 
Texas, and Jim Abbots signing with the 
White Sox after playing with the Yan
kees.

Baseball columnist previews Central Divisions
",,5A C"AARA
byAnuj Gupta
Its over ... for now. Enough 
said.
Lets get right into the predic
tions, starting with the National 
and American League Central 
divisions (combinations are done 
for the purpose of a shortened 
spring training). Unfortunately, 
for Bucs fans, the dream of a 
replacement pennant vanished 
as quick as you can say Play 
Ball, but more on that later.
Chicago Cubs: Although on 
paper it appears to be another 
dismal summer in the Windy 
City, the Cubs have made two 
moves in the course of the past 
two seasons which may allow 
them to surprise a few teams. 
First, they signed former Twins 
GM, Andy McPhail as team 
president. Secondly, they kept 
first baseman Mark Grace. A 
number of young pitchers are 
also on the verge of maturity  
including Kevin Foster, Anthony 
Young, Willie Banks, and Steve 
Traschel. There is enough tal
ent among those four to eventu
ally form an extremely formi
dable pitching staff. Theoffense 
will sulk with the expected loss 
of Sammy Sosa. Rick Wilkens 
and Tuffy Rhodes will have to 
pick up the slack. Predicted fin
ish: Fourth Place.
Cincinnati Reds: They will 
begin from the same point in 
which they left last August  
first place. Catcher Damon 
Berryhill and third baseman 
Willie Greene will fill in ad
equately for the departed Joe 
Oliver and Tony Fernandez. The 
pitching staff and the best pen 
in the National League are re
turning. Ron Gant should re
turn from a leg injury and fill in 
fine for Kevin Mitchell. Should 
problems occur, though, they will 
be in a head-to-head battle the 
entire season. Predicted Finish: 
First place.
Houston Astros: Due to financial problems, the Astros 
were forced to complete one of 
the biggest player transactions 
in the history of the game. Nev
ertheless, they are still a pen
nant contender. Any team with 
MVP Jeff Bagwell in the heart of 
the lineup will be 
tough to pitch to.
The addition of 
Derek Bell, Phil 
Plantier (both from 
the Padres deal), 
and rookie Phil 
Nevin (filling in for 
the traded Ken 
Caminiti) will only 
make the lineup 
stronger. The pitch
ing is deep, but not 
quite up to the par of 
Cincinnati. The dif
ference between a 
first or second place 
finish will again be 
Ron Gant. Predicted finish: Sec
ond place.
Pittsburgh Pirates: Unfor
tunately for Pirates fans, the 
replacement season is over and 
the real players have returned. 
The Pirates have no money to 
sign free agents and have made 
some unexplainable moves of 
late, such as the trade of Brian 
Hunter, which has only wors
ened their chances at any suc
cess. They have no power in the 
lineup. Although they have a 
talented, young staff, they can 
only do so much. Carlos Garcia 
will continue to develop. The 
future looks bright with the ad
dition of outfielders Midre 
Cummings and Trey Beamon, 
and catcher Jason Kendall, but 
it wont be until 1996. Predicted 
Finish: Fifth place.
St. Louis Cardinals: The 
mystery team made strong off
season moves with the addition 
of pitchers Danny J ackson, Tom 
Henke, and Ken Hill. With the 
return of injured Donovan 
Osborne, this could be the best 
starting rotation outside At
lanta. The offense is weak, espe
cially up the middle, and the 
loss of Gregg Jeffries will only 
hurt. In order for the Cards to 
stay in the hunt, Ray Lankford, 
Todd Zeile, Mark Whiten and 
Brian Jordan will have to take 
their play to the next level. Pre
dicted finish: Third place.
Now lets take a quick look at 
the Central version of the Junior 
Circuit.
Chicago White Sox: The 
reigning division champions were 
severely affected by the off-sea
son fiasco. The losses of infielders

tion players are potential AllStars, and rumors are circling 
around the possible addition of 
Orel Hershiser to the pitching 
staff. The team will also feed off 
the excitement that developed 
around Lake Erie last summer.

Joey Cora and Julio Franco and 
outfielder Darrin Jackson se
verely hinder the offense and de
fense. The trade of J ack McDowell 
also left a hole in the pitching 
rotation that will be filled in terms 
of talent (due to number of 
phenoms at the minor league 
level), but his leadership will be 
missed. Still, most lineups will 
have trouble with the likes of 
Alvarez, Fernandez, and Bere. 
The lack of offense will be what 
brings down this team. Predicted 
finish: Second place.
Cleveland Indians: With the 
hopeful promise of a full season, 
the time has come for the Tribe to 
become one of the elite teams in 
the game (no, thats not a joke). 
Although the pitching staff may 
not be as strong as that of the 
White Sox, the offense excels in 
all portions of the game, and they 
have yet to play one game with 
the September addition of Dave 
Winfield. Seven of the eight posiish: First
Place.
Kansas 
City Royals: 
This will be an 
introductory 
year of the ma
jor leagues to 
many of the 
Royals bright, 
young, pros
pects. The 
team has a 
solid nucleus 
with veterans 
such as Kevin 
Appier, Greg 
Gagne, and Jose Lind. The time 
has come for Michael Tucker, 
Dwayne Hosey, Larry Sutton, and 
Joe Vitiello to get their feet wet. 
This team will feature hot streaks 
and extremely cold streaksthe 
mark of a young but talented 
team. Predicted finish: Third
place.
Eric Strauss/Tartan Copy Manager
Milwaukee Brewers: Pitch
ing is really the only bright sport 
for this team with Cal Eldred, 
Ricky Bones, Bill Wegman, and 
Jamie Navarro rounding out a 
solid rotation. The rotation and 
the tenacity of manager Phil Gar
ner will be the factors which keep 
this team out of the cellar for 
everything else is a major ques
tion mark. If revenue sharing is 
not agreed upon, this could also 
be one of the last seasons of 
Brewer baseball. Predicted fin
ish: Fourth place.
Minnesota Twins: Every time 
Ive picked this team for dead 
last, they have won a World Se
ries. It wont happen this time. 
This team has more holes than 
my dirty socks. Their is talent on 
the way (Marty Cordova, Rich 
Becker, Erik Schullstrom, LaTroy 
Hawkins), but for now Kirby 
Pucket, the only remnant of the 
87 championship team, will have 
to do the best he can, in combina
tion with the managerial skills of 
Tom Kelly, to keep some life in 
this team. Predicted finish: Fifth 
place.

Spirit women break record

The atmosphere was one of antici
pation and excitement on Saturday 
morning as a number of organizations 
participated in the 1995 CMU Sweep
stakes. Preparations for the event be
gan from the early months of first 
semester as pushers and drivers en
dured vigorous training and mechan
ics perfected buggies intheweehours 
of the morning, striving to master the 
finer points of Buggy. An estimated 
800 people congregated for the affair 
despite the imposing clouds hovering 
above the course.
The first day of races got off to a late 
start due to rain from the prior night, 
leaving the course a bit wet. As al
ways, womens heats led off the days 
competition. It wasnt until the third 
heat that things began to get quite 
interesting, with the Sigma NuAteam, 
pushed by a combination of little sis
ters of the fraternity and Kappa Alpha 
Theta sisters. They staked a time of 
2:42.55 which put them ahead of all 
comers. Tins has been quite a change 
for an organization which never be
fore had shown to be a force in womens 
buggy races.
The heats progressed with Beta 
Theta Pi placing a competitive time in 
the next heat, only to be disqualified 
due to a drop test failure. This occurs 
when the buggy is tested, after the 
heat, to see whether the brakes func
tion properly.
In the following heat, Phi Kappa 
Theta also put in a good time only to 
fail their drop test as well. The last two 
heats featured the historical favorites 
in Womens buggy competition, Pi 
Kappa Alpha and Spirit.
The PiKA team finished with a dis
appointing time of 2:49.08. Spirit, in 
the last heat, rolled in with a remark
able time of 2:34.75, easily keeping 
ahead of the competition.
The final competition commenced 
on Saturday with two reroll heats. 
Reroll heats are held when an infrac
tion against a buggy or an organiza
tion takes place. One reroll heat for 
both mens and womens competitions 
was held. The womens teams that 
competed in the reroll heat were Fringe 
team A and Beta team A The victor of 
the race was Beta team A with a time 
of2:43.02. Fringe team A clocked in at 
3:01.28.
Following the reroll heats, the 
womens finals took place. In heat one, 
Student Dormitory Council (SDC), 
team A beat Sigma Nu team B with a 
time of 2:54.52. Sigma Nu was close 
behind SDC at the finish line with a 
time of 2:55.13.
The loss was amajor upset for Sigma 
Nu who was ranked third from the 
first day. They had been the favorite to 
win the heat, and had managed a 
better time the previous day.

Nu team A in the second heat of the

winning the up and over Hill one, and 
widening the gap in the downhill. 
Sigma Nu crossed the finish at 2:41.02 
while Pioneers trailed way behind at 
2:51.92.
In the third and final heat of the 
womens competition, PiKA team A 
raced against Spirit team A. Due to a 
spinout that occurred in the Chute, 
PiKA was unable to finish the race.
PiKas buggy managed to eat up 
most of the lead that the Spirit women 
had staked, but while attempting to 
passthe Spirit buggy, spun out, shred
ding tires and gracing the Chute with 
an avalanche of rubber, which was 
eagerly scooped up by spectators.
Spirit, however, was able to finish in 
record-breaking time at 2:33.03, enablingthem to win the womens finals. 
Sigma Nu team A took second, while 
Pioneers placed third. SDC team A 
grasped fourth place, and finally, 
Sigma Nu team B placed fifth.

The mens races got off to a start after 
completion of the womens heats. It was 
quite a day for races, with the sun shin
ing; the temperature was rather warm.
Jtm Snyder/Tartan Photo Editor The Hill three pusher for the Spirit mens A team prepares for the transition.
The first heat to show a notable time 
was the second, with Sigma Nu B com
ing in with a 2:17.70, a respectable fin
ish for a B team.
Needless to say the heat was not close 
with PiKA D and DTD C finishing around 
10 seconds behind.
The next heat certainly put a scare 
into many of the organizations when 
Spirit C posted a time of 2:13.12.
Considering that the organization had 
two better teams, and that this time was 
good enough for second place the year 
before, it was quite an achievement.
Two heats later the next of the buggies 
destined for the top 10 came through, 
with Pioneers A finishing with a 2:17.17.
In the next heat SDC A smoked DTD 
A, finishing with a time of 2:13.62, defi
nitely a sign that good things should be 
expected from the organization.
Heat 8 featured PiKA B and Beta B, 
perennial favorites for fast B teams, and 
Alpha Epsilon Pi A for their first entry in 
a few years.
The preliminary times were not good 
enough to make the cut this raceday and 
the B teams, though winning the heat, 
did not make the top 10.
The following heat featured Sigma Nu 
A, an organization notorious for fast 
buggies combined with a measure of 
inconsistency. They dominated the heat, 
facing down Kappa Sigma A and SDC D. 
Sigma Nu posted a time of 2:12.54,with 
a very impressive roll. The two other 
buggies in the heat were quite close, and 
in fact collided on hill three.
The last heats were coming up, and 
due to the way the heats are scheduled,
The 1994 champion, PiKA, rolled in 
the second to last heat, and faced down 
Theta Xi A and Fringe B. This proved to 
be no competition, with PiKA blowing 
both out with a 2:10.54, which placed 
them on top for the time being. This roll 
also featured another hallmark of 
raceday with PiKA chewing up a tire, 
leaving rubber in the chute to be scooped 
up by onlookers.
The last heat was Spirits, the most
yearssince organizations are usually a] 
lowed to change this because it cause 
obvious troubles for the prep crew.
At the chairmens meeting, PiKA too 
advantage of an obscure rule which state 
that the organizations are required t 
face off against themselves, and mad 
sure the Sweepstakes chairman enforce 
it.
Due to this rule, the first heat of men'i 
second day featured Sigma Nu facingo 
against themselves. There was a schei 
uled time of 15 minutes between the eni 
of womens heats and mens heats, bu 
this was cut in half at the last minut 
due to concerns about the weather.
This could somewhat explain wh 
Sigma Nu managed to put on 2.3 se< 
onds, finishing them with a disappoint 
ing time of 2:14.81. Their B team als 
lost a second from the first day endin 
up with a 2:18.53.

latter of which won with a time of

PiKAs roll, was also very im
pressive, with an incredibly fast 
loll time down the hill. This heat 
hows the value of competition to 
the pushers, as SDC shaved off 
2.8 seconds from the first day. 
The fifth and final heat raced 
the Spirit A and C teams, who set
out to beat their previous times.
There was a odd upset in this 
heat with Spirit Cs Hill one beat
ing their A team pusher.
This led to a very close race 
through the chute, with Spirit A 
only dominating on the back hills. 
Spirit A came in at 2 minutes and 
10.27 seconds, beating their C 
team by 3.65 seconds, as Spirit C 
came in at 2 minutes and 13.92 
seconds.
This placed Spirit A as second 
in the finals, followed by SDC in 
third. This is an interesting set of 
results as it is the only time since 
1987 that Spirit has not come 
back from a loss to win the follow
ing year. It also could be a sign of 
another PiKAbuggy dynasty such 
as in the late 70s, but of course 
only time will tell.

Spirit wins first, SDC second in buggy design contest
By JAMES STEPANEK
Tartan Staffwriter
The Sweepstakes competition 
composed of two parts. There is 
the race itself, and the buggy de
competition. The buggy de
sign competition consists of the 
luggies from all of the involved 
irganizations being on display 
rom 10 am to 2 pm on the Thurs
day right before races. The de
cree to which these organizations 
ake the competition seriously 
varies from group to group. Some 
organizations merely see it as a 
waste of time, while others beome quite involved in the prep|ing of the buggy for the judging. 
The current crop of buggies is 
still dominated, in numbers at 
least, by the one-wheel-in-front 
shape, which I will refer to as the 
gendtype for historical rea;ons. Afew organizations, includPiKA, the 94 race champiins, have a design with two 
wheels in front, but all enclosed, 
will refer to this as the Jama 
ype.
The competition consists of

qualify for the win, the buggy 
must achieve a raceday time 
which places it in the top third of 
finishing times (this is 14th or 
better place in mens races). This 
used to be top half but it was 
decided that the ability to finish 
in one of the most competitive 
slots was also a design criteria.
This year was a strange year in 
design. Some of the more suc

two from SDC, KDR and Pio
neers. These buggies were sent 
back in for final judging.
PiKA, summing up their over
all view of the Buggy Design com
petition, said, What the hell is 
design? PiKA has never entered 
the design competition due to 
concerns about secrecy and gen
eral indifference. They did, how
ever, have three buggies of the 
Jama design on display which
were on block instead of tires.
Spirit, who is a perennial com
petitor in this area, as they have 
quite a successful record, said, It 
[Haraka] should be the fastest 
buggy. They entered two buggies 
in the competition, Haraka (95) 
and Shaka Zulu (92). Spirit fea
tures some of the most aerodynamically advanced Legend-type 
buggies.
SDC, the other organization 
which placed two in the final six, 
entered Sam bvca (94) and Escar
got (91). They feature the Lege/id-style, with a line reminiscent 
of Spirit in their construction.
Pioneers also made the cut, with 
Helios, another of the Legendtype. This buggy has a rather 
unconventional shape, which has 
to be described as singular to Pio
neers. KDR rounded out the six 
with Pumpkin King. This buggy,

Booths capture spirit of animation; entertain campus
By TRICIA DAVIS
Tartan Staffwriter
The booths at Spring Carnival im
pressed everyone. It was obvious from 
the intricate designs and immense struc
tures that all of the organizations in
volved devoted a tremendous amount of 
time and energy to create their booths. 
Besides being a lot of fun, the proceeds 
from the games benefit the Big Brother, 
Big Sister charity.
Sigma Nus booth carried The Little 
Mermaid theme. For 25 cents, a person 
was given three tries to bounce a ping 
pong ball into a bowl to win a goldfish. 
This booth was surrounded by little kids 
waiting for their turn, many of whom 
were already holding a plastic bag with 
goldfish in it.
Paul DeSarra, a junior in SDS and 
president of Sigma Nu, said, The little 
kids love it. We bought about 2,000 fish 
for our booth. To save money we have 
been using the same booth for the last 
four years. We just repainted it and 
developed a new theme. Its for charity, 
so you want to spend the least amount of 
money as possible so you can make the 
most money for charity.
The He-Man booth created by Delta 
Tau Delta earned a lot of attention. The 
two story exhibit required contestants 
to wear a He-Man battle shield, sit on a 
giant model of Battle Cat, and fire plas
tic balls at Skeletor using a hand-made 
crossbow; The prizes included candy and 
He-Man weapons.
Phi Kappa Thetas booth, a two-story 
replica of the Addams Family house,
was also a main attraction. The interior selves with one of the giant wooden Pooh 
displayed a fireplace with a detailed and characters ASA painted,

When asked about the accident on

structural problem; the booth just 
toppled over when they were carrying 
it. Concerning the appearance of all of 
the booths, she added, There are a lot of 
booths that are looking really nice. They 
surprised the committee this year. Its 
going to be a tough call for the judges.

Spectators gathered in front of Wean Hall to witness the first annual Mobot Race.
Mobots display undergrad robotics skills
By ALLIE KING
Tartan Staffwriter
Following the infamous 
buggy race on Saturday morn
ing, a new and slightly similar 
event took place on the Mall 
outside of Wean Hall.
This year marked the first 
annual Mobot Race, an event 
in which undergraduate CMU 
students displayed their abil
ity to work with robotics by 
building and racing small au
tonomous vehicles.
As small red signs along the 
Mobot course explained, a 
mobot is a self-controlled, selfpowered vehicle that is capable 
of certain actions; in this case, 
running a slalom course con
sisting of curves and gates that 
must be gone through.
Following a set of regulations, 
each contestant is allowed to 
use any sort of vehicle that they 
want; they can buy a remote 
control car and alter it, or they 
can build their vehicle from 
scratch.
A preliminary competition 
was held on Wednesday, March 
29. In first place, winning a $50 
prize, was Daniel J. Bothell as 
team DJB. The $30 second 
prize went to Samuel Miller, as 
*team Bert, and the $20 third 
prize went to Adrian Drury.
The finals this weekend al
most had to be postponed. As 
those who were involved in or 
attended buggy are aware, Sat
urday morning brought thun
der and rain to the area.
Before the race was schedL 
uled to begin, the committee 
was consulting about whether 
or not they should postpone the 
race.
Some of the contestants said 
that they would be upset if they 
had to wait. Im going to be pissed 
if we cant race today. Im ready 
now, said Bothell, one of the com
petitors.
As rain is a problem for buggy, 
it is even more of a problem for 
the mobots. The mobots work by 
an infrared light sensor on the 
vehicle that can sense the light 
from the white line that the course 
consists of.
When the ground is wet, the 
mobots are often disabled, or do 
not run as smoothly as they would 
on dry ground.
On the other hand, however, 
many of the mobots experienced 
difficulty when the sun began to 
shine around the time of the sec
ond round.
The mobots light sensors can 
also be confused by shadows and 
sunlight, causing them to follow 
their shadow or go in the wrong 
direction.
After the course was blown dry 
with a leaf blower, the committee 
decided that the race would go 
on. Contestants who had been 
doing practice runs throughout 
the morning, as well as earlier in 
the week, got their vehicles ready 
to show what they could do.
In order to be eligible for a 
prize, the mobot must pass 
through the second gate. This gate 
is after a slope in the sidewalk, on 
which many of the mobots picked 
up too much speed and went off 
course.
Because of the alternating wet 
and sunny conditions, as well as 
other unforeseeable problems 
with the vehicles themselves, 
most of the mobots did not make 
it to the second gate, and were 
therefore not eligible for a prize.
The race was sponsored by 
SCS, RedZone, and Schlumberger, who provided the prizemoney that the contestants 
competed for. The prizes were 
set at $1,000 dollars for first, 
$500 for second, and $250 for 
third.
Because only one mobot made 
it through the second gate, only 
one prize was awarded. This 
went to team DJB, who had 
won the preliminary competi
tion as well. DJB made it to 
the eighth gate in about 1 
minute and 35 seconds.
This time was a new record 
for autonomous robots on this 
course, as Ben Brown, one of 
the Mobot organizers com
mented during the race.
Honorable mentions went to 
teams Bert and Adrian 
Drury, both of which had re
ceived prizes in the prelimi
nary competition.
There was a very large turn
out to both the preliminary race 
and the finals. People stood 
behind pink rope from Wean 
Hall all the way up the hill, 
watching these small mobots 
feel their way down a white 
and winding course by them
selves.
Although many of the mobots 
did not make it as far as their 
makers had hoped, the event 
was a great success.
We hoped to give under
graduates a chance to display 
technically-good things and to 
demonstrate their ability. I 
think weve succeeded.
The organizers and partici
pants all hope that this will 
continue and grow as an an
nual event as the other tradi
tions at CMU.

Yo La Tengo falls short of potential
By PAUL TABACHNECK
Tartan Diversions Editor
Last Saturday, to a cavalcade of Whos?, 
to La Tengo, Carnivals 1995 feature act, took 
the stage in the Mid
way Tent. It was a 
pretty packed place  
it seemed everyone 
wanted to at least give 
them a listen-to, and 
find out why this group 
that was being featured, 
rather than a Buzz Bin 
group like Belly or Live.
Unfortunately, that 
crowd fizzled out 
qiiickly as the rain be
gan to slow.
; I; dont think Yo La 
Tengo is a bad band; 
their female drummerguitarist-vocalist 
kicked ass, as did their 
bassist. Unfortunately, 
it didnt seem like the 
lead guitarist/vocalist 
had really shown his 
licks to the rest of the 
group, or, for that mat
ter, himself.
; The rhythm section 
was always on top, but 
tills guy just kept slam
ming his guitar until he 
was satisfied that he 
had robbed the song of 
all possible appeal.
 The best song he sang was the soundcheck, 
where he just sang I wanna be your 
boyfriend girl over a rock-ballad 
vamp. No, he said to the 
applauding audience,
That was just a0 u n d - .w
It takes three to Tengo...
check. In other words, dont clap for me numbers. But then the lead guitar would 
until I start sucking. come in and ruin everything.
When the drummer sang, I felt pretty well Its a shame; he was actually quite witty,
transfixed; she had her melodies planted in with his roundabout slam of their apparent 
the ground, as did the bassist during his reception here at CMU: Were really hon
ored to be hereI mean 
that both sincerely and 
sarcastically. Also, his 
frequent nods to the 
noisy VR machine in the 
back displayed for us 
that he was living in the 
same time continuum as 
the rest of us. It just
didnt show in the mu
sic.
So, if I were to give 
any advice to the band, 
it would probably be 
this. Drop Yo, and get a 
better guitarist. Heck, 
La and Tengo could 
probably even do with
out another guy; they 
seem individually tal
ented enough.
Id like to compliment 
the campus on showing 
up for the show to get 
their own opinion of 
it; Im just sorry that 
it couldnt have been 
a better show.Jason Siegendorf/Tartan Photographer

Musical acts 
rock campus
By JASON ANDRACKI
Tartan Staffwriter
Blogurt
Pittsburghs own Blogurt brought their unique, always witty, 
always entertaining music to campus Friday at 2:00 on the Drill 
Deck. Playing a lot of songs off their independently released 
debut CD We Like To Eat, they managed to draw a crowd of 
around 100 at a very difficult time to play with the rest of the 
Carnival in full swing. Vocalist and guitarist Dave Macarchick 
said, We didnt have anything like this at Temple way back in 
my day. Patti Smith came and played and we all got drunk.
Having previously heard a little about Blogurt, I anticipated 
laughing at them, but I was unsure of their music. Laugh I did, 
but more so, I was impressed and surprised with their authentic 
musical talents.
Just from the looks of Blogurt, you can tell they are one of a 
kind. Ive never seen a bassoon played the way Aime Defoe did, 
and I guess thats a shame. This was also the first time Ive seen 
one of those little boxy, straight from the 80s New Wave 
Movement basses since Robert Palmers last video. However a 
mannequin-like female wasnt playing, but actually a CMU 
graduate, Dave Chief Rubin.
Metaphysical Stone and Trousered Apes were among the 
standout tunes, but Oprazon was one of the highlights. Blogurt 
led into this one with a discussion of the merit of that late night 
talk show host Gordon Eliot. With its great discussion of Ameri
can culture, I was almost laughing too much to really appreciate 
this song. However the combined background vocals of Defoe 
and Rubin had me humming the chorus for the rest of the day.
*$!@?9s a Puppet made me think about Sesame Street in a 
whole new way. Macarchick asked for requests, and like clock
work fans yelled Play some Skynyrd! and Freebird. Thank
fully, they didnt oblige. After some deliberation about how to 
end the show, rather than going mellow, they went out rocking 
with WHT, a tribute to the U.S.s 27th President, William 
Howard Taft. The bassoon in this tune had a very haunting 
Munsters-like sound which I really enjoyed.

. vocalist, two percussionists, 
guitar, bass, trombone, and saxo
phone), but I guess thats normal 
for a ska band. Their bouncy up
beat tunes were very likable. The 
crowd certainly seemed to take a 
liking to Bim Skala Bim, as hun
dreds of students, alumni, and 
visitors were filling the make
shift dance floor in front of the 
stage. All were dancing, many 
pogo-ingto certain songs, but they 
all were moving to Bim Skala 
Bim. I was impressed that the 
crowd didnt try to prove its Gen
eration X-ness by moshing and 
crowd-surfing.
All the members of Bim Skala 
Bim are talented musicians, but 
it was the trombone and sax that 
feally electrified the crowd. The 
entire band really played off the 
crowds energy, and they even 
invited a few people to join them 
1 stage to dance.
Probably the highlight of the 
set for me was hearing a familiar 
song, Dark Side of the Moon by 
Pink Floyd, covered in a ska fash
ion. With the heavy reggae influ
ences, this was not the sound I 
expected to hear from seven white 
uys from Boston.
After leaving the stage, Assis
tant Entertainment Chair An
drew Sproule brought them back 
for an encore. To show their ap
preciation, band members tossed 
freebies to the crowd. Heres our 
new album, it looks like this, 
and threw the CD Frisbee-style 
into the crowd. Bim Skala Bim 
didnt do anything poorly, but I 
wish they would have used the 
horns more, not just for the intros 
and solos to songs.
Lava
After taking first place at the 
Mastercard Acts at Homecoming 
and playing the Beaux Arts Ball, 
a once again entertained their 
peers on Friday at noon on the 
Drill Deck. Playing their rock in 
the style of Phish and the Dave 
Matthews Band, they drew a 
crowd of about 50 in a very diffi
cult time slot.
These talented musicians 
Played mostly originals, which 
made them even more impres
sive. The combined thumping 
;s of bassist Bo Blanton and 
drummer Neil Srinivasan, along 
with the jangly guitars of Josh 
Curtain and Aaron Berkson, won 
ver the audience. Dustin Brown 
also played a mean harmonica on 
song that would have been avrage otherwise, pushing it to 
e*ceptional heights.
In addition to Flail, Baby You 
Drive Me Crazy, the more mellw Take Me Away, and other 
0riginals, Lava did a few covers.
Their version of 
Tom Pettys An Ameri
can Girl minus Pettys na
sal twang was especially good. 
Hopefully Lava is a group we will 
see more of in the future.
Roger Gillen
Roger Gillen returned once 
again to celebrate Car
nival with a 1 pm set 
Friday in the Tent.
Gillens solo acoustic set 
went over well with the 
small but approving 
group. Gillen has already 
received accolades from 
Rolling Stone, and re
cently, he was voted Best 
Songwriter in France.
Gillen was very expres
sive with both his guitar 
and his words. Most of 
this Irishmans songs 
had a very somber feel to 
them that contrasted 
with the beautiful 
weather outside the tent. 
Although just as brood
ing as tunes like Rory 
and Hazelwood, Wait
ing picked up the pace 
and displayed Gillens 
impressive fret-work.
Between songs, Gillen told us 
what inspired some of the num
bers and made a lot of sarcastic 
comments. Not only is he a tal
ented musician, but he has a very 
quick wit.
One song, Jims Accordion, 
was inspired by a fellow musi
cian, a one-toothed accordion
player who 
struck Gillen as an in
triguing soul.
Most of Gillens songs were 
slower and dark in nature, but 
he managed to slip an upbeat 
song, Dont Take Our Freedom, 
into his set. He ended his set with 
Dance in the Meadow, and said, 
Our time was short but sweet... 
for me, anyway!
Gillen played an excellent, emo
tional set in somewhat adverse 
conditions. Somehow, though, his
Dave
Bostons own Bim Skala Bim kicked in a seven-man jam in the 
Tent, much to their audience's approval. The ska stylings of 
this septet drew people in from the Midway like a magnet.
music seemed better suited to 
last years venue of Scotland Yard, 
rather than the Tent on Midway.
Frankenstein
Frankenstein got funky at Car
nival for the second year in a row. 
Scaled back to a four-piece this
year (drums, guitar, 
bass, and vocals), they lit up 
the make-shift stage in the Drill 
Deck on Thursday at 7 pm. After 
playing last years Carnival, 
Frankenstein can now be seen 
performing at Lucianos, the De
cade, and other local venues.
They played mostly originals 
like Fender Bender and 
Caged, and even debuted a new 
tune, Loverman. Caged actu
ally managed to get some of the 
lethargic students up off the floor, 
and there were very few people in 
the audience of over a hundred 
that could resist their remake of 
Michael Jacksons Billie Jean. 
This song, complete with imi
tations of 
Jacksons 
dancing and 
screeching 
voice 
(thankfully 
no crotchgrabbing, 
though) 
from vocal
ist Chris 
White, was 
clearly the 
highlight of 
their perfor
mance.
Although 
the rest of 
the band 
wasnt very 
animated, 
White more 
than made 
up for them 
with his high-energy acrobatics. 
White took a break and let the 
rest of the band get all of the 
attention with the impressive instrumental, Rod 
Stewart. Scream, a more mel
low one, and Little Miss Lovin, 
with its Zeppelin-like intro remi
niscent of The Immigrant Song, 
rounded out their set along with 
Funky On You.
Frankenstein closed with 
Hunk of Lovin, a very funky 
tune that went from being peacemanaged to find an adult-sized 
pair of Spiderman Underoos, 
while the bassist opted for the 
puffy sleeves look a la Carmine 
Ragusso. The guitarist sported 
pants made from neckties, and 
the drummer wore a patchwork 
of various Hawaiian shirts.
With outfits like that, it was 
hard to take the Ijits seriously. 
Fortunately, that was the way 
the Ijits wanted it; they even 
played their original songs, like
ful to explosive at the passing of Making Babies, Smile, and 
an instant. The crowd demanded Traffic Jam through amps cov
an encore and received another ered with fish wrapping paper! 
new song,
Afro. White 
said the song 
would be a little 
rough, but that 
was far from the 
truth. This song 
was unblem
ished, with a 
driving beat 
maintained 
from the very 
beginning.
Probably due 
to exhaustion 
more than any
thing else, Fran
kenstein played 
their final song 
for the evening,
Big Fish. This 
was another 
highlight, due to 
Whites hilari
ous Sammy Da-vis, Jr. imperson
ation. If you missed Franken
stein, look for flyers around cam
pus advertising other shows.
flits
Ijits, a local band which prac
tices right up the street from cam
pus, played a rare all-ages show 
in the Drill Deck as the first band 
to perform at Carnival. This cor
nucopia o music and fun was 
quite a sight to see and hear.
Each band member sported 
some unusual dress. The vocalist
Jim Snyder/Tartan Photo Editor
Frankenstein funks their way through a huge set in 
the Drill Deck, making everyones Thursday night a 
little groovier.
Another song, Happiness is All I 
Take Seriously, ironically, was 
the most serious song and was 
probably the highlight of their 
set.Mocking all the genres of 
music equally, the Ijits played a 
spirited hour-long set. Although 
a humorous band, they are also 
talented musicians. Actually 
and this is unusual for a band of 
their type  they knew how to 
play their instruments. Similar 
bands like the Dead Milkmen and 
King Missile focus more on the 
laughs than the music.
You can clean up the rivers if you try, if you get to them early enough. You can pro
tect rain forests, if you stop the destruction early enough. Past a certain point its too 
late and thats what all these efforts are aboutto save us from ourselves. I just hope 
that there are enough people out there who can realize that with us and can do their 
part as we are now.   Lorin Maazel

Last Thursday night, I stormed 
into the tent with a feeling of 
mild hostility. It was time for 
Billy West to speak for the Spring 
Carnival crowd.
West is the voice of the Honey 
Nut Cheerios Bee, Nickelodeons 
Doug, a load of cockroaches which 
live in a place called Joes Apt., 
and, of course, Ren and Stimpy, I 
was itchin to ask a few ques
tions, and they werent pretty 
ones.
Many people have heard the 
story of The Ren and Stimpy 
Show; how Nickelodeon and its 
mother company, MTV Produc
tions, ousted creator John 
Kricfalusi because of creative dif
ferences, and grabbed all of the 
merchandising rights to the show.
Some may even know that Billy 
West, who was the original 
Stimpy, took on the extra role of 
Ren when Kricfalusi was fired 
(Nickelodeon even had 
Kricfalusis songs rerecorded for 
the You Eediot soundtrack al
bum, with West on vocals).
After reading an interview done 
in an animation magazine be
tween Kricfalusi and Beavis and 
Butthead creator Mike Judge, I 
felt a lot of animosity towards 
West. I kind of thought of him the 
same way one thinks of a scab 
(for non-yunzers, a scab is a 
worker that comes in when the 
, unions are on strike, usually do
ing a better job with a better 
attitude). After a night of hearing 
him speak, and after he addressed 
the issue, though, there was no 
doubt that this guy was all right.
West gave time to a lot of great 
modern topics, including the one 
he hates most, the third-parent 
role that kids parents have 
saddled television with.
On the infamous Beavis and 
Butthead fire controversy, he 
said, I dont know  it just 
wouldnt have ever occurred to 
me to burn my house down. But 
then, that was probably because 
I had parents.
; On the buzz surrounding 
Disneys The Program (a bunch 
of lunkheads who laid out in the 
middle of the street got run over
after seeing a scene in The Pro
gram, where the lunkheads were 
unharmed), he was heard to re
mark, I just figured it was natu
ral selection. I mean, people that 
stupid? Come on.
I asked him what he thought of 
Nickelodeons tendency to stilt 
the shows repulsive qualities. 
What started out as beautifully 
subversive, said West, slowly 
the matriarchs got their hands 
on it and injected it with saccha
rine. They cave into pressure, like 
this macaroni factory, which 
changed the shape of their maca
roni because some parents de
cided the macaroni was shaped 
too much like a penis. Everyone 
has their agenda. [The parents 
groups] are just groups wanting 
attention  Youre let down by 
your leaders, so you start up a 
group to get you that power.
He also gave us a large back
ground bio on himself, from his 
start doing voices on radio to the 
present time.
When it came time to talk about 
R&S, he revealed to us that origi
nally, he was supposed to do both 
voices, but Nickelodeon thought 
that the strain would be too much 
on West, so Kricfalusi took the 
role. Also, West explained what 
it was like on that set around the 
time of Kricfalusis dismissal, and 
that, to him, it was just a thing 
where someone was fired, and it 
wasnt him. Kricfalusi wants to 
make us think that West schemed 
against him, but the cards just 
didnt fall that way.
When we asked him about 
Kricfalusi later, he said, Well, 
that was a very high-maintenance 
relationship. We never talk any
more.... But was there a confron
tation? Well, sure, there was this 
period where he was calling ev
eryone up and yelling at them to 
get them to leave the show, but 
for what? To be unemployed?
I told him, Listen, if you sell 
something else, and you can offer 
me the money, Ill come running, 
but dont expect me to just drop 
the show and leave it for dead 
because you got fired. Amen to 
that.
He told us what inspired Ren 
and Stimpys voices  Stimpy 
can be found in Stooge Larry Fine,
and Ren is melodramatic expres
sionist actor Peter Lorre (in Space 
Madness, Rens rantings are di
rect Peter Lorre rip-offs)  and 
that Paul Tsongas was the inspi
ration for Stimpys first fart and 
son Stinky.
Ive never seen methane per
sonified before, said West, And 
when I was watching CNN, rack
ing my brains, this voice kept 
poppingup, like [waxingTsongas] 
I wanna be President o the 
United States of America! It just 
worked that way, the voice was 
so pinched and uptight.
On cartoons today: Theyve 
taken the bite out of them. All of 
the confrontation is gone, and 
everyones miniaturized... The 
Muppet Babies. The Flintstone 
Kids. Little Rosie. I mean, an 
animated kid version ofRoseanne 
and Tom Arnold? It blew, of 
course, like I thought it would. I 
am going to do my own cartoon, 
and its probably going straight 
to video, because it will be so vile, 
so disgusting, that no network 
will air it.
On childrens cartoons: [They] 
put me off with the name 
childrens. When The Simpsons 
came out, and Fox said it was a 
cartoon meant for adults, that 
was like putting up a huge neon 
sign that said,  'Kids! Youre 
gonna love this, cause its not 
gonna pander to you!!! 
Finally, on todays stand-up 
comedy: Is there that much mis
ery in the world, that we need 
that much comedy? [waxing 
standup:] Has anyone else ever 
looked at the world today? Ever 
notice everything!?
AB Lectures really came 
through with this one; West was 
funny, charming, and brought a 
great clip of a Japanese-dubbed 
Space Madness. He certainly 
changed the way I viewed him; 
when his new album comes out in 
September, Im pretty sure itll 
be on my list.
Without a doubt, this was 
Carnivals most special treat of 
all.

Come Thursday, I was giddy 
with excitement believing that 
this was going to be a weekend to 
remember... for various reasons. 
I was helping to man a table we 
set up for a club and noticed that 
there were some VR machines in 
the tent that people were just 
flocking to. This, as I knew, was 
going to be my chance to go in 
there, to enter a world that only 
lives inside a computers crude 
setting of silicon and transistors.
It began to rain as I made my 
trek towards the humming boxes 
at the rear of the tent. With some
trepidation (in response to watch
ing a couple of episodes of Foxs 
VR5), I stood in the line for Dactyl 
Nightmare, a game which some 
people will recall from Virtualitys 
visit last semester. Unlike the 
other two-person game there, 
Dactyl Nightmare was based on 
polygon animation and not the 
texture-mapped graphics that 
were present in Zone Hunter. It 
looked crude, but it seemed to 
effectively get the point across.
I entered the game, strapped 
on the motion sensing belt and 
fitted the helmet, and voila, I 
was in VR. At first, the stuff 
looks cheesy, mainly because of 
the graininess of the LCD screen
(which also was the complaint of 
people using Zone Hunter), but 
once the game starts, you seem to
forget about all the technical stuff. 
Once I got used to this thing track
ing my every movement, I seemed
to become (shudder) quite adept 
at it. You win Dactyl by finding 
your opponent on a five-platform
board and shooting him or her 
before they shoot you. You can 
move your arms around to aim,
you can crouch, and, if youre good, 
you can even sidestep! My oppo
nent only got off one kill early in 
the game but I just came back 
madder and better, and the game 
ended with me winning, 6 to 1 in 
a three-minute game. Of course 
it felt like longer than three min
utes, and the disorientation lasted 
for about five minutes after leav
ing the game.
My next attempt Was group VR 
in the Alpha Experience 3D, 
where 12 people sat strapped into 
a big black box with a projection 
screen at one end.
Once again, the three minutes 
in the simulator seemed longer 
given the experiences provided
us in this hyperactive flight simu
lator. I had the same reaction to; 
this simulator as I did when \ 
tried the Ring Of Fire: ugggh... 
my stomach dont feel so good.
It was pretty neat; the graphics 
in this game were rendered with' 
excruciating detail compared to 
the real-time interactive VR machines and their texture mapped 
and polygon graphics.
All in all, the whole VR experience this weekend was impres
sive for the first-time user, and I 
saw that even the veterans of 
VR were having fun. So, the nexttime you get a chance to expeii 
ence something of this magnitude ... please just do it.
At first, the stuff looks cheesy, 
mainly because of the graininess of 
the LCD screen, but once the game 
starts, you seem to forget about all 
the technical stuff.

Carnival succeeds 
despite many changes
By PAUL TABACHNECK
Tartan Diversions Editor
Jim Snyder/Tartan Photo Editor 
Carnegie Mellons own Frankenstein earns the 
hardest-working-band title, playing three gigs in 
three days for Carnival.
Well, another Spring Carnival has come and gone. As this article goes to 
press, J&J Amusements is packing up their rides. Booths are either being 
moved back to their frathouses or being dismantled; by the time this ife 
published, the wood will have been thrown away in dumpsters, which will bfe 
ravaged by material-hungry art students the next morning. The tent will bfe 
taken down, and Morewood Gardens parking tenants can stop arguing with 
Spring Carnival committee members (But please, officer, cant I just park 
between the rides?). Yes, once again, Carnegie Mellon University will resumfr 
its breakneck class schedule and all will be well.
So now we ask ourselves this question: How was it? Was this last taste of
freedom an ideal one? Will I 
be able to look back on thisC
 Carnival and say Well,
^ . , guess Id better start study* A ing with a smile? Did I have
fun? Can I have fun here?
Yes, Mary Margaret, there 
is a such thing as fun at 
CMU. ;
For those of you who cur
rently attend MIT, Spring 
Carnival 1995: A Few 
Strokes for Wild Animated 
Action kicked into gear last 
Thursday with a little bit of 
cloud and a lot of warmth. 
The slow action caused by 
the combination of rain and 
classes gave the campus 
community a great opportu
nity to check out the booths 
and rides without any dan
ger of stepping on little kids. 
And hey, you could ride the Gravitron all by yourself if you wanted!
Thanks should go to AB for providing us with another visit from Virtuality, 
as well as the Alpha Experience motion simulator, which kicks the butt of any 
of its brothers Ive ever been able to ride on. Also, the Billy West lecture 
provided an excellent insight on the cartoon voice business, and on the 
workings of The Ren & Stimpy Show.
A big hooray goes out to whoever decided we should get more rides this 
year, and a big boo-hey for 
whoever thought raising the 
ticket price from 50 to 60 cents 
would be a nifty idea. I loved 
watching, but Ive got more im
portant things to pay for than 
inflated tickets for overpriced 
rides  Like groceries.
And now, the bands. The con
certs I got to see were pretty 
terrific; Frankenstein gets the 
hardest-working-band-inAmerica award for doing three 
frenetic gigs in three nights. Two 
things must be thought when 
watching those guys in action: 
first, Damn, theyre smooth, 
and last, That vocalist is really 
going to hurt himself! Blogurt 
and Squonk Opera rocked the 
Drill Deck, and Rock Challenge 
winners D.O.S.E. put on a good show (Frankensteins Friday gig) at Roselawn 
Terraces block-party-style throwdown. The CMU Giants of Jazz Ensemble * 
was great, and Yo La Tengo didnt do too badly, either.
I believe I speak for all students here when I thank the University for putting 
up an easel-shaped display with a title resembling Building For the Future^ 
especially for Carnival. The spread showed us our future University Center,
and all of the other sites 
of renovation in the 
near-future. Im sure we 
all realize that this is 
just another way the ad
ministration is trying to 
reach out to its students, 
and not at all an effort tq 
elicit some funds from 
loaded alumni.
Basically, Carnival 
had everything this 
year. A watertower fell 
(it was re-erected), Billy 
West came and yelled 
(we were all affected), 
the rides increased, no 
one deceased, a bunch of 
good bands, and booths 
built by hand.
Now, all we have to, 
worry about are finals..
Passengers were constantly climbing in aricj - 
out of the Alpha Experience Machine for a 
Virtual Reality fix.
The Carnival Midway, shown above in all of its glory, 
is now back to just being the plain old Morewood 
parking lot.

play: Lucky Stiff 
performed by: Scotch n Soda 
Directed by: Stephanie Palmer (music 
direction by Christina Farrell)
The art of musical theatre is a delicate 
one; the mixture of dance, music, and 
drama produces a huge challenge to any 
director that makes an attempt.
If one of these aspects is lacking, the

production is lost. A lacking production 
could have a bunch of kids with great 
voices doing jazz squares, or great danc
ers that even lip-synch poorly, or even 
actors that cant either sing or dance, 
and the audiences will go home think
ing the thought that school-bound ac
tors fear: Well, its not like its profes
sional theatre.
Thankfully, Scotch n Sodas produc
tion of Steven Flahertys musical com
edy Lucky Stiff achieved the optimal 
goal of musical theatre  to entertain.
After its last musical production, Into 
the Woods, which featured a cast divided 
about 50/50 between dramats and oth
ers, it was refreshing to see a play which 
featured mostly students from the other 
end of campus (Darren Mauro, the male 
is a Computer Science major). 
Performances by Mauro, as well as 
H&SS freshman Kimberly Sims and 
BHA sophomore Lisa S. Marinacci, make 
Lucky Stiff the kind of success a musical 
theatre production needs. Performances 
like these make one wonder: Did these 
people audition for CFA when they first 
here, and if they didnt get acThe plot is this: A British shoe sales
man (Mauro) receives word that his 
American gangster uncle is dead, and 
that he has inherited six million dollars 
from him.
The catch: he must take his 
uncles corpse (played to a Bemie 
crisp by Jameson Soh) to Monte 
Carlo on a prearranged gambling 
spree, in which they will eat the 
finest of meals, live the finest of 
lives, and scuba dive.
But theres more  the uncles 
legally blind sexpot wife (played 
by Sims), who has killed both the 
uncle and her lover, has 
laid an extortioned claim 
on the money already, and 
had laid the blame for it 
on her brother (freshman 
biological sciences major 
Adam J. Peelor), a humble 
and naive orthodontist 
with a cookie addiction.
For fear that her hus
band has a contract out on 
her brothers life, she 
whisks her brother off to Monte 
Carlo to find the money and get 
rid of the mobsters that she 
thinks are approaching. This, 
and a hindering but lovely 
spokeswoman (Marinacci) for 
the Universal Dog Home of 
Brooklyn, the charity to which 
the six million dollars will re
vert should the nephew fail to 
carry out the last wishes of his 
uncle, creates a web of havoc that for
ever twists and turns. That is, until the
uncle shows up and clears everything up 
for everyone.
Confused? Dont worry, they like it 
that way, and so did I.
The band is tight, the choreography is

H&SS freshman Kimberly Sims added some extra zest to 
Scotch n Sodas latest musical theatre triumph, as a 
flamboyant shortsighted extortionist sexpot.

amazing, and the only rigid perfor
mances are that of Soh and the human 
set pieces, played by Max Chittister, 
Sameer Karim, Sofia S. Zuberi, and Lisa 
Essig. And even these characters emerge 
when it is time to be more than inani
mate.
The final test I usually give a play is 
the reaction of the audience around me. 
Needless to say, the room was in stitches 
as Sohs statue-esque corpse jumped into 
a tap-dance during a nightmarish dream 
sequence, as well as the high-speed far
cical second act, and 
 oh, hell, we all 
laughed through the 
whole thing.
If I could give five 
stars to this play, I 
would. If I could rate 
it ten out of ten, I 
would. If I could rec
ommend everyone 
get out to the Rodef 
Shalom Temple and 
check out this play 
over the weekend, I 
would. But, alas, this 
production only ran 
through Carnival 
weekend.
However, to para
phrase a certain his
torical figure, I will 
say that my only re
gret is that I have but 
one review to give for 
this production. It 
was that good.
No, really, it was.
