To the man who has decided that for him 
fraternity life has something definite to offer,
' .ye say: free your mind of much that you have

 Just exactly how can they do their utmost?

to arouse opinions, it is sponsoring a peace 
poll that will reach approximately 150,000 un- dergraduates in this country By means of the
- strength it derives from the union of college 
newspapers in this matter it seeks to abolish 
war by ascertaining what policies the students 
consider the best to insure peace and how the 
students would act if war were declared.

THE LESS SAID ABOUT THE PANTHER-TART AN game the better, 
seems to me. Hod the Ladies from Hell gotten off to a belter s 
perhaps it would have been a different tale. But as ft was, even 
Panthers didnt'play a very good'game. I thoxight the Harpster
put ob a much better exhibition against the Hllltoppers than they 
the finale.
wo of the scores made by the Pitt aggregation were purely gifts. 
The old fumble play gave the opponents a perfect set-up early in the 
and it didnt take much for the Panthers to make good use of it. 
Had they been playing in the class showed, earlier in the season there 
ild bave been no need tor a showof generosity from the Tartans. 
There was a dearth of co-ordination -noticeable among the Plaid 
ers, which lins been showing itself all through the season, not at
tributable to the players lheraselves.
OCCASIONAL SKIRMISHES BETWEEN "TWO GUN1' ACKLEY and 
the Pitt Panthersometimes the entire Pitt banddid a lot to relieve 
the tension during the ball playing. A show of spjrlt such as that 
lends hope to the students who remember the school when it was lively. But what will Carnegie do when Ackley graduates?
Senior yellers Glehel and Davis did a graceful swan song. They 
are to be congratulated on a very successful season. 1 can say with, 
out contradiction that the cheering of the past season, and of the year 
before, has been much more responsive than it was previously. Leader 
Gisehel was very sentimental when he realized that it was his last 
stand before the Carnegie football section, and hes taken his oath to 
keep the remnants of his derby, his sweater, and this paragraph till the 
end of his days.
THE COLLEGE ALL-STARS VS. THE PITTSBURGH PIRATES game 
-, another slow cr.e, but it accomplished. Its purpose; I euppose.
At first' it appeared that the only advantage the Pirates had over 
the All:Stars was in the professional rules, but later on In the game it 
seemed equally apparent that the Pros could handle the opposition with

Since  thenT hoVver, he has been right in there and has earned for himself the right to be ranked with Auch -stars; as Lloyd Yoder, Hugh Sprinkle, and Tank Hlghberger.
