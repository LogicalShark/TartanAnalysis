Harrisburg rally protests PAT cutbacks

Starting in March, there may 
be no Port Authority buses on 
weekends, and weekday trans
portation may end after 9 pm. 
These changes, along with a 
bas fare increase from $1.75 
to $2.50 and the elimination of 
several bus routes, will be final
ized by the end of November if 
state Senate Bill 1162 and its 
companion House Bill 2697 are 
not passed by the legislatures.
Everyones affected, said 
Tim Vining, executive director 
of the Thomas Merton Center 
(TMC) in Pittsburgh. Its the 
students, the elderly, the blind, 
and those without automobiles 
whose only means of getting to 
work and out of the home is by 
taking the bus. The TMC acts as 
a resource and organizing center 
for over 30 different projects,
including the grassroots group 
Save Our Transit, whose mission 
is to lobby for adequate funding 
for public transportation.
According to Vining, Save Our 
Transit was pivotal in bringing 
together a couple hundred peo
ple from Pittsburgh, Philadel
phia, and throughout the state 
to rally in favor of the bills at 
Harrisburg on Wednesday, in
cluding six students from Carn
egie Mellon University. Student 
Body Vice President Julie Beckenstein met with House Repre
sentative Dan B. Frankel and the 
legislative director for Senator 
Jay Costa Jr.
It wont be just businesses and 
the handicapped who will feel 
the aftershock of the Port Au
thoritys proposed actions, said 
Beckenstein. Graduate student 
Gretchen Underwood would be 
one of those left searching for 
a ride; she currently takes the 
bus two to three times a day to
commute to and from campus. 
Similarly, sophomore ECE major 
Michael Zizza takes the bus on 
weekends to get to his car, which 
he parks in Squirrel Hill.
According to Port Authority 
statistics, about 108,000 people 
use its public transportation sys
tem every Saturday. Last years 
ridership came to nearly 68 mil
lion people. The Port Authority 
carries approximately 50 per
cent of workers and shoppers 
in downtown Pittsburgh and 
covers an area of 730 square 
miles, including all of Allegheny 
County and limited portions of 
Armstrong, Beaver, Washington, 
and Westmoreland Counties.
But according to its website, 
the Port Authority now shoul
ders a $30 million deficit and 
significant budget challenges 
due to the skyrocketing cost of 
health care, fuel and pension

Summit program offers 
students eclectic classes
by Amanda Flynn
Staffwriter
From January 6 to 8, Carn
egie Mellon University faculty, 
staff, and students will have 
the opportunity to take classes 
not typically offered at Carn
egie Mellon. This opportunity 
is presented by a new student 
program called Summit.
Roger Ma, a fifth year senior 
in the Business Administra
tion and Economics program, 
started Summit as part of his 
Fifth-Year Scholar project. Ac
cording to the Summit web 
page, the goal of the program 
is to [provide] students with a 
vibrant opportunity to explore 
a variety of personal interests 
without limits.
The program, named Sum
mit because it takes place 
at the pinnacle of the aca
demic year, is open to Carn
egie Mellon students of 
all years.
Ma said, The vision was to 
create a program where Carn
egie Mellon students could 
learn about a variety of top
ics which they may not have 
an opportunity to during the 
academic year. Ultimately, I 
wanted to create a program 
that allowed students to learn, 
experience, and grow in an 
exciting environment free 
from the tremendous pres
sures present in the regular 
academic year.
Basically, we just thought 
of classes we would person
ally like to take, said Nick 
Deangelis, a sophomore in 
business administration and 
one of Summits organiz
ers. Among the forty classes 
offered during Summit will 
be The Perfect Medical 
School Applicant, How to 
Be a Player: Relationship Tips 
from a Master, Spice It Up: 
Hot Salsa Techniques, UFO 
Sightings and Other Strange 
Events of Pennsylvania, and 
Furniture Making: Save Your
self a Trip to Ikea. Students 
are also offered classes on selfdefense, cooking, handwriting 
analysis, massage therapy, and 
a variety of other topics.
Classes will be taught by 
Carnegie Mellon students, fac
ulty, staff, and outside profes
sionals who have been invited 
to teach by Ma and his co
organizers.
Not only will this be an 
enriching opportunity for par
ticipants of Summit, but it will 
also be an exciting time for 
instructors to experiment with 
different methods of teaching 
and to explore different topics 
of study, said Ma.
Deangelis agreed, saying, 
Ill be happy with personal 
growth and community.
All course descriptions and 
time listings for classes are 
available on the Summit web
site, www.cmu.edu/summit.
Registration for Summit is 
done on a first-come, firstserved basis. Applications will 
be accepted until December 3; 
the cost of registration is $26.

Greek town hall meeting discusses new policies
Alexander Meseguer/Layout Manager
SDC Vice President Jana Leong discussed allocations with cmuTV representatives on Wednesday. cmuTV was looking for 
funding to help cement its proposal of a twenty four-hour television station.
Current Greek Leadership housefellow Damian Dourado spoke at the Greek town hall 
meeting on Thursday. During the meeting, a UDC decision that prescribed disciplin
ary measures for two houses was discussed.
by Brittany McCandless
Staffwriter
Last Thursday a Greek town 
hall meeting was held in Doherty 
1112 to address current concerns 
in the Greek community.
The topics on the agenda in
cluded University Disciplinary 
Committee (UDC) guidelines 
and actions, future changes to 
be considered in the Greek com
munity, and current disciplinary 
and organizational problems in 
the fraternities and sororities. 
The council addressed issues re
garding self-governing and self
policing in the houses, focusing 
on the recent rash of alcoholrelated incidents. The UDC an
nounced that two houses must 
begin to implement a dry 
policy: one house for one se
mester, and the other for two 
years. Enforcement tactics of the 
dry policy include having po
lice officers visit the respective 
houses seven days a week, four 
to six times a day. The houses 
will pay a $320 stipend per 
week to supplement the officers 
salaries.
Several Greek students also 
brought forward a request for 
Student Life to take a more con
structive role in the Greek com
munity, rather than intervening 
solely as a disciplinary body.
Students at the town hall 
meeting asked for more proac
tive forums similar to the town 
hall meeting, and Student Life 
will take the responsibility to 
make sure the opportunities are 
provided in the future, stated 
Renee Camerlengo, director of 
student life. According to Camerlengo, members of the Greek 
community also pushed for 
more resources and education 
on national risk management 
policies.
Both members of the ad
ministration [and] Greek stu
dents accepted responsibility for 
separate weaknesses in the cur
rent Greek system, said Greek 
Council President Erin Weber, 
a senior design and psychol
ogy major. Both sides further 
agreed on the importance of 
collaborating in the process of 
writing a relationship statement 
to define the roles and expecta
tions of both parties. I am happy 
to say a task force composed of 
Greeks, faculty and staff is cur
rently being gathered with the 
goal of writing such a relation
ship statement.
I believe the University is 
continuing to ask the Greeks to 
live by their stated values, said 
Camerlengo. The Greek com
munity has all the elements to 
be incredibly successful, includ
ing talented members, Univer
sity, national, and alumni re
sources, and the infrastructure 
to support self-governance. 
There have been some very 
significant steps taken by Greek 
Council, IFC, and Pan-Hellenic 
this fall and there is a large and 
diverse working group having 
discussions and doing research 
to identify what would help our 
community achieve what we all 
know it is capable of achiev
ing. These students are to be 
commended.
Other speakers at the meeting 
included current Greek Leader
ship Housefellows Damian Dou
rado and Monica Bebie.
A nine hundred-dollar chunk of 
campus residents dorm activity 
fees has been in limbo for the past 
month as cmuTV has attempted 
to obtain funding to expand its 
programming. The organization 
has received funding from two 
sources: Student Senate and the 
executive branch of student gov
ernment. cmuTV is now trying to 
get funds from the Student Dor
mitory Council (SDC), which has 
narrowly voted down a version of 
its proposal once already and de
layed votes on two other versions 
three times.
cmuTV, a student organization 
widely known for its annual pro
duction of Buggy video during 
Carnival, recently acquired 24- 
hour broadcast rights to channel 
17 on CMUs cable television net
work. They also moved into new 
offices in Margaret Morrison. The 
organization is currently seeking 
funds to cover the costs of that 
move and to buy the proper pro
gramming equipment. Student 
Senate has given cmuTV $7500, 
and Steven Kling, student body 
vice president for finance, has 
given $800 of his own budget. 
Kling said he felt that SDC should 
contribute a meaningful amount.
Motion tabled and placed under consideration of SDC 
funding chair because the requested amount was over 
$1000. Amount cut from $2500 to $1000.
cmuTV unable to attend because of John Kerry's visit.
Motion voted down 6:3:2. Failed to pass 2/3 majority of 
all submitted votes by one.
Miscommunication between president of cmuTV and 
SDC funding chair results in motion's not being brought 
up at meeting.
Motion about to be voted on when member leaves; 
meeting loses quorum. SDC then unable to make any 
binding votes; motion automatically tabled for another week.
Motion will be brought up at next SDC meeting for 
consideration.
Lizza McGregor/Art Editor
He said that he sees cmuTV and 
SDC as serving the same audi
ence.
Last Wednesdays meeting pro
duced the third delay in what will 
likely end up being a six-week 
process for cmuTV, whether or 
not they receive any funding from 
SDC. This most recent delay was 
not because of procedure or mis
communication  the reasons 
for two previous delays  but
because of a last-minute loss of 
quorum, the minimum number 
of people needed to make bind
ing votes. Quorum was lost when 
an SDC member left the meeting 
before it ended.
After the meeting, Greg Batta
glia, president of cmuTV and a 
senior information systems major, 
was visibly angry. You shouldnt

Pornography Watching in 
Hunt Library
6 November 2004 19:15
Carnegie Mellon campus 
police received a report that 
an individual was watching 
pornography in Hunt library. 
Two police offers were dis
patched to the library and 
encountered a white male 
sitting at a computer on the 
fourth floor. The individual 
was not a member of the CMU 
community and was warned 
by CMPD that viewing porn 
is not permitted where others 
can see it.
Alcohol and Mushrooms 
Dont Mix
9 November 2004 05:36
A student called CMPD, con
cerned that a friend was 
having a negative reaction 
to mixing alcohol and psy
chedelic mushrooms. The 
alcohol amnesty program 
was invoked and the stu
dent in question was taken 
to the hospital. Students are 
strongly advised not to mix 
hallucinogenic mushrooms 
and alcohol, and, in case of 
such a reaction, to seek help 
immediately.
CPS Employee fired for 
Stealing
10 November 2004 02:04
A CPS employee was fired for 
stealing food from the CMU 
Food Drive box in Doherty 
Hall. The employees supervi
sor terminated the employee 
when he found that she had 
taken a can of chips from 
the Food Drive box that the 
supervisor had placed there. 
The can of chips was open 
and was partially empty. The 
supervisor had suspected that 
the employee had been steal
ing food from donation boxes 
in the past.
Smell of Marijuana
10 November 2004 23:41
Three citations were issued 
for students in Boss Hall who 
were caught after smoking 
marijuana. An anonymous
Incident
caller informed police that 
individuals were using mari
juana. CMPD was dispatched 
to the room in question and 
noticed a strong smell of mar
ijuana. The police knocked 
on the door and were told to 
come in. After knocking 
again, the door was opened 
by one of the residents, whose 
eyes were described as glassy. 
While the residents at first 
denied usingmarijuana, when 
the police officer threatened 
to call the Pittsburgh police 
and bring a drug sniffing dog, 
the students admitted to hav
ing used the drug, claiming 
that a friend had brought it to 
their room. When the police 
visited the friends room 
down the hall, he also denied 
the charge at first, even when 
the police mentioned that 
he had been accused by his 
neighbor. When the officer 
present threatened to bring a 
drug-sniffing dog, the student 
relented and produced a bag 
of vegetable material, later 
identified as marijuana. The 
student in question also men
tioned that he had previously 
smoked with the two inhabit
ants of the first room. The 
police informed the subjects 
that since they both reported 
each other, they were to con
sider each other even.
Toilet Stolen from Wean 
Hall
11 November 2004 11:28
A toilet, fixtures, and other

Communications Committee: If youve got big ideas, prove it!
Maureen Burns
As Chairperson of Student Senates 
Communications Committee, it is my duty 
to facilitate communication between the 
student body and the administration. The 
first step in this process is making student 
government more accessible to students. 
In order to do this, the Communications 
Committee has started several initiatives 
to ensure that Student Senate remains a 
fundamental outlet through which stu
dents can express their concerns and cre
ate change on campus.
It is not only critical that your voices 
are heard, but that you know your con
cerns are being addressed. I would like to 
share with you some of the undertakings
that Student Senate has been working 
hard on to make this happen.
First, Student Senate wants to hear 
more of your ideas about shaping the 
campus community and your univer
sity experience. We want to give you 
the opportunity to realize your biggest 
aspirations. Big Ideas is an initiative to 
obtain from students their visions for 
how to improve campus life, community, 
and anything else students want to be 
addressed. All suggestions are encour
aged and can be sent to big-ideas@.
Second, the Communications 
Committee is actively working on install
ing display cases for each individual col
lege. These cases will allow us to post 
information about Student Senate, such 
as how to contact your Senator or issues 
that are relevant to your college.
Third, Senate is working hard to reach 
out to strengthen its ties with other cam
pus organizations to increase student 
participation. We are actively conducting 
meetings with academic student advisory 
councils, resident assistants, and housefellows in order for Senators to better 
educate themselves about the concerns 
of the student body.
Fourth, the Business Affairs Committee 
is actively seeking student feedback on 
the quality of the services that the univer
sity offers to students. Comment boxes 
have been installed in the bookstore, 
Entropy, and the art store. Surveys will 
also be distributed around campus to 
gather input regarding whether Campus 
Express fully accommodates students 
and meets their standards.
Student Senate has also created an ad
hoc committee dedicated to addressing 
recommendations from the Presidential 
Commission Report on The Natrat. 
Specifically, the committee is emphasiz
ing the promotion of diversity on cam
pus.
It is important to ensure that your 
voice is heard on campus. These initia
tives are only the beginning of many to 
come that will help reinforce your role as 
an active member of this community. If 
you perceive that your voice is not being 
heard or have any other concerns please 
contact your Senator and we will try to 
address the issue.
The effectiveness of the Undergraduate 
Student Senate starts with your active 
participation to let us know what is 
important to you.
The Halo 2 phenomenon
Pillbox, 10
Executive
Privilege
Its time for a change. There exists 
enough student discontent with the 
organizational infrastructure on 
this campus that we should begin 
challenging these institutions. In 
this issue alone we discuss prob
lems with the Student Dormitory 
Council (SDC) and the University 
Disciplinary Committee (UDC). In 
previous issues this semester weve 
been critical of both the Activities 
Board and Student Senate.
In many ways, these organizations 
are unlike any others on campus. 
Student Senate and SDC are the gov
erning bodies that are supposed to 
represent students, yet there are few 
people who truly feel that Senate or 
SDC represents them. To be blunt, 
these organizations control student 
dollars and should be controlled by 
the student majority, yet that doesnt 
seem to be the case. Their histories 
are littered with cases of embezzle
ment, favoritism, and bureaucratic 
shenanigans.
Its no wonder that so many stu
dents are largely turned off by these 
groups.
Although it is a surprise that so 
much attention has come to AB this 
semester, it is widely known that 
it is long overdue for a change. For 
years, understaffing and low inter
est levels allowed a small group 
of people to run many parts of AB 
without any democratic selection or 
recourse to the greater student body. 
Accusations of bias have brought the 
organization under scrutiny and now 
students are demanding that it be 
more responsive to their concerns.
The UDC is a different and, per
haps, more important concern. It is 
easy for students to spend four years 
at CMU and only come into lateral 
contact with AB, Senate, and SDC. 
Coming in contact with the UDC, 
though, is no laughing matter, as 
the UDC has the ability to terminate 
any students time at CMU. If Senate 
doesnt like you, they wont fund 
your event. If UDC doesnt like you, 
its time to pack your bags.
Each of these organizations has 
unique problems and there is no 
one-size-fits-all solution to fix them. 
Yet there exist common themes that 
underlie all of these challenges.
Firstly, these organizations need 
to be more open to the community. 
We should not tolerate secret justice 
or secret budgets. While there may 
be a need to protect the privacy of 
individuals, the community has a 
right to know much more than it 
currently does.
Secondly, these organizations 
need to be more democratic. Say 
what you will about Senate, but at 
least the community has the chance, 
to elect members. SDC and AB need 
to be more democratic in how they 
choose their leadership. It is entirely 
unacceptable that the current head 
of AB Political Speakers was chosen 
for the job solely because he was 
the outgoing chairs housemate. This 
kind of cronyism and favoritism is 
far too common in these organiza
tions and can no longer be tolerated. 
UDC may be the worst of them all.
Although students are asked by 
the administration to participate, 
one can only imagine what metric is 
used to choose these students.
Thirdly, and most importantly, 
these organizations only continue in 
this manner due to lack of student 
interest and scrutiny. If students 
were interested in SDCs structure or 
in improving UDC, these organiza
tions would no longer be able to run 
the way they do.
Its time for change. These organi
zations are unlike any others at CMU. 
They are structural elements of the 
university and they have an inordi
nate amount of money and power. 
Its time for students to improve 
these institutions and work to make 
them better for the university.
There are some in Senate and AB 
already working towards this goal, 
but they need our support in order to 
turn these organizations around.

THE TARTAN  NOVEMBER 15, 2004
Mr. Fraternity Competition held in Rangos by sisters of Kappa Alpha Theta
performance was quickly cut short 
when the presenters realized that the 
poem contained vulgarity. Some nota
ble performances included junior ar
chitecture major Coleman Rusnocks 
cover of the Darkness I Believe in a 
Thing Called Love, which included 
a five-piece band and Rusnock as the 
lead vocalist and guitarist, and junior 
SHS student Daniel Walshs military 
rifle routine in full uniform, coordi
nated to a French opera piece.
The formalwear competition fol
lowed, introducing brothers and their 
respective escorts. The final competi
tion was the Question and Answer 
interview, where contestants were 
asked to pick a question from a bowl 
and answer to the best of their ability.
Overall, audience members seemed 
to enjoy the show. Michelle Birchak, 
a senior materials science and engi
neering and public policy major, felt 
things went very well. I chatted with 
some of the brothers during rehears
als, and they were all very cooperative 
and professional. The whole event 
went very well. She did note a few 
problems. During SigEps band per
formance, at first you couldnt hear 
the vocals on the lead singer. And 
he was the guy who was fighting for 
the title!
To present the award, last years 
Mr. Fraternity, senior Roman Fiola of 
Beta Theta Pi, came out to give up his 
crown. The title of Mr. CongenialKayhan Ahmadi/Photo Staff
Max Martinelli, a sophomore in SHS, reenacted the birth of man as his featured talent.
ity was awarded to Flynn Jones of Pi 
Kappa Alpha, who was commended 
on his help for the preparation of the 
event and his commitment to Mr. Fra
ternity. The third-place award went 
to Walsh of Kappa Sigma, the sec
ond-place award to Chris Mangan
ello of Beta Theta Pi, and the title 
of Mr. Fraternity 2004 to Coleman 
Rusnock of Sigma Phi Epsilon. When 
asked to comment on his victory, Rus
nock said, SigEp has never won Mr. 
Fraternity before, so it feels really 
good to bring this to the house. He 
continued by acknowledging it was 
a group effort: I couldnt have done
anything, though, without all the 
support from my brothers, friends, 
family, and Theta. Rusnock meant 
his comment literally, as his broth
ers from Sigma Phi Epsilon carried 
him out on a chair for several of his 
appearances.
The event sold approximately 
625 seats, raising over $4000 from 
ticket sales alone. Drogowski com
mented that Theta hoped to raise 
over $5000 from parent and alumni 
donations alone.
cmuTV recorded the events on 
DVD, copies of which were available 
for purchase after the show.

Students, Save Our Transit
protest a possible cutback
RALLY, from Al
contributions. The Senate and 
House bills are seen as the only 
way out of what is becoming an 
increasingly uncomfortable situ
ation. Within the last seven years, 
the Port Authority has dispensed 
of 141 positions and implemented 
hiring, wage and salary freezes 
for all employees in order to enact 
more than $145 million in costsaving initiatives. Barney Oursler, 
a member of the Mon Valley Un
employed Committee, explained 
that 400 jobs will be lost if the 
Port Authority is again forced to 
make cutbacks.
He also said that bus drivers 
are the front-line people who are 
already under attack and pres
sured about quality of service and 
maintenance issues.'Laying off 
bus drivers and eliminating tran
sit in certain areas would cause 
further overcrowding on buses, 
more pollution, and augmented 
traffic congestion. Once you lose 
services, its very hard to get them 
back, said Oursler.
The solution outlined in the 
bills is to allocate a larger percent
age of the state sales tax for bus, 
trolley and train services, setting 
aside an additional $282 million 
a year statewide, with $64 million 
specifically for the Port Authority. 
This would secure a dedicated, 
reliable funding source for im
mediate and long-term public 
transportation projects, Oursler 
adds, avoiding the yearly crisis 
in funding those projects.
The debate in Harrisburg, how
ever, also extends towards big 
capital ventures such as a possible 
tunnel under the Allegheny river 
towards North Side, said Ours
ler. This is a massive investment 
and construction project that the 
government wont commit to un
less it sees a future in Pittsburgh 
transportation services. To lose 
the possible revenue and op
portunity that would be created 
would be another disadvantage to 
Pittsburgh citizens.
For Tim Vining, the issue is 
more directly seen as a fight for 
public services that must be no
ticed because we will lose this 
bus system if the issue is not kept 
alive. Without an outcry from 
the public, Vining suspects that 
politicians will move the money 
elsewhere.
Some, like the elderly who rely 
on non-emergency medical trans
portation, will see their quality 
of life diminish if the Senate and 
House bills are abandoned. Oth
ers, such as first-year MCS student 
Danielle Gerlach and first-year 
H&SS student Kelsey Foss, won
der how they will be able to reach 
the entertainment, restaurants, 
and museums that Pittsburgh has 
to offer college students.
Students bolster the argu
ment, said Beckenstein, for keep
ing an effective busing system 
working in Pittsburgh. To help 
the Carnegie Mellon community 
express its opinion on the issue, 
the student government will host 
a letter-writing campaign at Skibo 
Coffeehouse on Tuesday.

On Saturday Kappa Alpha Theta 
presented the 29th annual Mr. Frater
nity competition. During Mr. Frater
nity, brothers from Carnegie Mellons 
Greek community competed based on 
their looks and talent. All proceeds 
from the event were donated to the 
Karen Johnson Fund of the Ohio Lung 
Association.
This years judges included Cindy 
and Rich Lackner, parents of pre
senter Kimberly Lackner; Joanna and 
Tom Tano, parents of presenter Ann 
Marie Tano; New House housefellow 
M. Shernell Smith; SCS professor Don 
Slater; and Jennie Schweitzer, a Theta 
alumna. The event was hosted by 
senior Theta sister Laura Drogowski.
The beachwear competition fea
tured a member from each house pa
rading down the runway wearing his 
interpretation of beach appropriate 
clothing. The togawear competition 
showcased the brothers creativity in 
designing and flaunting their various 
togas. The third competition was the 
talent competition, which included 
several lip-syncing and dance num

be able to leave if youre midway 
through a discussion. Its diffi
cult for the person making the 
proposal and it puts the organi
zation in a tough spot when try
ing to explain to the person why 
youre kicking them out midway 
through, said Battaglia. Im 
really still surprised or perhaps 
even shocked ... that what hap
pened tonight happened.
Voices on both sides of the 
motion were loud and insistent. 
Supporters touted cmuTVs po
tential for advertising on the 
new station and described it as 
a forum for student-created pro
gramming, while detractors saw 
the potential allocation as a violation of their constitution and 
without a direct benefit to the 
campus community.
Alex Chen, the SDC fund
ing committee chair and a ju
nior English major, encouraged 
members to participate and ask 
questions rather than voting 
against or abstaining and then 
claiming ignorance afterwards.
Raza Ali, the SDC films com
mittee chair and a senior in eco
nomics and computer science, 
then said he thought cmuTV was 
tailoring their proposal to satisfy 
SDCs members without meaning 
to follow through on promises of 
making the channel open to all 
students and organizations.
At around 8:20 pm quorum 
was lost. The SDC leadership did
not realize it until a few minutes 
later, when the member who had 
left was beyond reach. The dis
cussion continued briefly, end
ing shortly after Aaron Brown, a 
resident assistant in Morewood 
E Tower and a sophomore in the 
Tepper School of Business, said, 
I would get more impact from 
cmuTV than from SDCs booth 
and buggy put together. By that 
point opinion had shifted in favor 
of the motion, but whether it was 
the two-thirds majority required 
for this type of allocation is un
known.
As the members realized that 
further business could not be 
conducted, discussion turned 
briefly toward why turnout for 
the meeting was so low. Mihir
Kedia, a sophomore in computer 
science, said that the location 
might be a cause. The meeting 
was held in the basement of the 
off-campus Shirley Apartments, 
which only residents with valid 
Housing Services keys can enter. 
This would have made it difficult 
for those not living in Shirley 
Apartments to attend.
Regardless of the results of 
next weeks vote, many feel that 
the past month has been a tu
multuous one for cmuTV. Well, 
a lot of people spoke positively 
towards cmuTVs proposal... its 
difficult to have answered so 
many questions and to have tried 
to justify as much as I have and 
have it pushed back another 
week, said Battaglia.

Junior Staffwriter
This week, professors, software 
developers, researchers, vendors, 
and students assembled at the 
David L. Lawrence Convention 
Center in Pittsburgh for the 2004 
Supercomputing Conference. 
High-performance computing, 
networking, storage issues and 
ideas, and recent achievements 
were all discussed amongst the 
trailblazers that look to define 
the next generation of computing. Exhibits and demonstrations 
filled the convention center. We 
probably have billions of dol
lars of computer equipment on 
the floor, vendor liaison and in
dustry volunteer Doug Luce told 
the Tribune-Review. Among the 
groups in attendance were more 
than half a dozen industry heavy
weights. Over 100 universities, 
laboratories, and other research 
groups were also present, offer
ing displays at the show.
The theme of the conference 
was Bridging Communities, in 
both a technical and an architectural sense. Two state-of-the-art 
pieces of technology demonstrat
ing this theme were featured 
at the conference. The first was 
StorCloud, a storage device pre
sented to attendees through the 
StorCloud Challenge. Partici
pants used test applications to 
find the most creative and suc
cessful ways to make use of ran
dom accessible storage, storage 
bandwidth, and I/O operations, 
the hallmark capabilities of the 
technology. Were trying to es
tablish storage as one of the legs 
of high-performance computing,
Ken Washington told the Post-Ga
zette. Washington is the director 
of distributed information sys
tems at the Sandia National Lab
oratory in Livermore, Calif.
InfoStar was also showcased, 
demonstrating a collaboration 
of wireless devices, data sources, 
and software that provided real
time conference information and 
interactive maps to participants. 
StorCloud and InfoStars new 
technologies set the standard for 
the conference, whose backbone 
has not always been the exhibits. 
Generally, exhibits were present
to showcase new technology that 
would not be seen on the mar
ket for a few years, encouraging 
partnerships among businesses 
before the products release.
The latest breakthrough in the 
world of supercomputing comes 
from IBM. With government 
funding, IBM is in the process of 
building a complex supercom
puter that, while only partially 
complete, already doubles the 
speed of Japans Earth Simula
tor, the previous champion and 
winner of a Gordon Bell Award 
at last years conference. The IBM 
BlueGene/L recently achieved a 
record-breaking performance of 
70.72 teraflops (trillion floating
point operations per second). By 
way of comparison, one teraflop 
is about 100 times faster than the 
most powerful desktop computer. 
When complete, the BlueGene/L 
is expected to reach a staggering 
360 teraflops. The ultimate task 
of this monster machine will be 
to perform complex calculations 
to simulate the condition of aging 
nuclear weapons.
Businesses have begun to em
brace supercomputers and are in
corporating them into everyday 
use. Supercomputers can help 
by computing delivery routes, 
analyzing supplies, or planning 
capacity and timing. Credit-card 
companies use them for complex 
fraud detection analysis. Other 
retailers are using the capabilities 
for data mining, which employs 
often complex algorithms and 
search methods to look through 
old databases of information and 
come up with new patterns. In 
the past, supercomputers have 
been used for scientific research 
in areas such as weather, astron
omy, and biotechnology, as well 
as in exploration for oil and gas.

Heart pill designed 
for black patients
A pill that combines two drugs 
reduces deaths in black pa
tients with heart failure, and is 
expected to gain FDA approval 
soon. NitroMed, the drugs 
maker, tested it among 1050 
black patients," and found that 
the group of patients who re
ceived the drug had 43% fewer 
deaths due to heart failure than 
the group who didnt. NitroMed 
did not test the drug on non
blacks, a move that black cardi
ologists hailed as a positive step 
because medical studies often 
exclude minorities. Blacks are 
two and a half times more likely 
to suffer from heart failure than 
other racial groups. If approved, 
the new drug would be the first 
ever approved for a specific 
race.

Tonal languages, 
perfect pitch linked
Young musicians who speak 
certain Asian languages identify 
isolated musical notes much bet
ter than English speakers, accord
ing to a University of California 
study. In a comparison of mu
sicians who have similar abil
ity, about 60 percent of Chinese 
subjects who started studying 
music between the ages of four 
and five had perfect pitch, but 
only 14 percent of the American 
subjects analyzed did. Students 
who started studying music later 
were also less likely to have the 
ability.
Perfect pitch is defined as 
the ability to identify between 
notes that differ in frequency by 
six percent. Only one in 10,000 
Americans has perfect pitch. 
Researchers theorized that de
veloping perfect pitch is like 
learning a second language for 
speakers of tonal languages and 
like learning a first language for 
others.

Mothers should 
mimic kangaroos
Premature babies could ben
efit a lot from being treated like 
joeys, or baby kangaroos, ac
cording to Colombian research
ers. Premature infants need to 
stay warm, and are often placed 
in incubators to keep them from 
getting cold. The new kangaroo 
therapy places the baby, wear
ing only a diaper and a bonnet, 
against a parents bare chest, 
where constant skin-to-skin 
contact will keep it warm. The 
technique could save many lives 
in third-world countries, where 
incubators may not be available 
for all premature babies.

Gmail to gain POP 
e-mail support
Gmail, the popular e-mail ser
vice provided by web search giant 
Google, will soon gain support 
for the e-mail protocol POP, com
pany sources said on Wednesday. 
POP (Post Office Protocol) sup
port will allow users to down
load their mail to programs like 
Mozilla Thunderbird, Eudora, or 
Microsoft Outlook and read it 
offline. Google is still tweaking 
and adding features to Gmail, 
which is still in a beta release. 
The service is free, but people 
can only get accounts by invita
tion. Gmail distinguished itself 
from other free e-mail services 
such as Yahoo! Mail and Hotmail 
when it was introduced by offer
ing a gigabyte of storage space.

ACIA Report 
predicts future 
of the Arctic
by Corinne Pascale
Science and Technology Editor
The worlds top environmental 
scientists gathered in Reykjavik, 
Iceland, last week for the Arctic 
Climate Impact Assessment (ACIA) 
International Scientific Symposium 
on Climate Change in the Arctic. 
The official ACIA report was pub
licly released on the symposiums 
opening day, offering a series of 
grim predictions for the future of 
the Arctic. Chapters of the report 
covered the expected fate of the re
gions climate, indigenous people, 
and wildlife over the next hundred 
years.
Since 1990, the Intergovern
mental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC) has produced three Assess
ment Reports on global effects that 
have served a solid background for 
the ACIA. The ACIA was created by 
the Arctic Council and the Interna
tional Arctic Science Committee 
(IASC) as a response to the IPCC 
Reports, based on the desire to of
fer in-depth attention to the Arctic.
Impacts of a Warming Arctic-, the 
ACIA Overview Report released 
to the press last Monday, outlines 
what the organization believes to 
be the most important of its find
ings. These changes in the Arctic 
provide an early indication of the 
environmental and societal sig
nificance of global warming, be
gan the report. It continued with 
predictions that within a century, 
many significant changes will af
fect those living in the polar circle.
Temperatures worldwide are 
increasing at a surprising pace. 
The predictions suggest a magni
fication of this trend in the Arctic, 
with some areas seeing a further 
rise of three degrees Celsius within 
the next hundred years. Accord
ing to the report, the warmth will 
cause glaciers to continue melting, 
spawning an increase in sea level 
ranging from four inches to three 
feet. Towns on the coast as far south 
as the Florida Keys will slowly lose 
land to the ocean.
Forests are expected to shift to
ward the tundra, a land which has 
traditionally been the site of most 
grazing and avian breeding. There 
will be a slight decline in the migra
tory bird population, and the num
ber of caribou and reindeer will

How Things Work: Credit Cards
P.O.S. Device
by Joe Elliot
Staffwriter
You press CREDIT and 
swipe your card. You leave with 
$50 worth of groceries, and 
you havent had any cash on 
your person all day. The mer
chant knows hell get your $50, 
however. Likewise, you can or
der your textbooks from a web 
site, and your order can ship 
within minutes of it being re
ceived  you dont even have 
to have a checking account.
Credit cards and debit cards 
have had a pretty dramatic im
pact on our lives and the way 
we do business, especially since 
the advent of the Internet. Un
like some technology of which 
people are actively aware, credit 
cards and the infrastructure that 
supports them are invisible most 
of the time, so you might not 
even think about what happens
when a transaction is autho
rized. Of course, that authori
zation hasnt always been quite 
so instantaneous or secure.
The first universal credit card 
(as opposed to department-store 
credit cards which were only 
good at a specific store) was 
introduced by Diners Club in 
1950. The story is that business
man and Diners Club founder 
Frank McNamara found himself 
without enough cash to pay for 
a meal, and he was inspired to 
invent the credit card after con
vincing the restaurant owner to 
take an IOU. In the early days, 
there wasnt a massive com
puter and telecommunications 
infrastructure in place to handle 
credit card business, so transac
tions were performed primarily 
via an exchange of paperwork 
between merchants, credit card 
companies, and banks. As credit 
cards increased in popularity, so 
did credit card fraud; merchants
Lizza McGregor/Art Editor
needed some kind of payment 
guarantee before they let mer
chandise walk out the door.
The earliest form of point-ofsale (POS) credit card autho
rization was known as voice 
authorization. As the name sug
gests, this technique involves 
the cashier making a phone call 
to the merchant bank or acquir
ing bank  the company that 
provides the merchant with the 
ability to process credit card 
transactions. Voice authoriza
tion is still used today in situ
ations when a damaged card 
cant be read by the magstripe 
reader, when a cashier suspects 
a card to be fraudulent, or by 
merchants who only make a few 
transactions every month. In the 
late 60s this was the only way 
that credit cards operated, and 
as credit cards gained in popu
larity, checkout lines in depart
ment stores rapidly got out of 
hand. By 1970, nationwide networks for processing credit card 
transactions had been estab
lished to streamline POS credit 
card authorization. Phone calls 
were made from machine to ma
chine, but the transaction still 
relied largely on a subsequent 
exchange of paperwork for the 
merchant to get their money.
These days, the card data are 
read from the magnetic stripe on 
the back of the card, and the only 
paperwork involved is the sales 
draft signed by the customer, yet 
the transaction still has two steps
 a legacy of 1960s technology. 
This is true even for transactions 
made on the Internet. Before 
you walk out of the store, your 
transaction has to be authorized 
to confirm the legitimacy of 
your card. In order for the mer
chant to receive payment for the 
transaction, it has to be settled, 
which usually occurs at the end 
of the business day for retail 
transactions. When your credit 
card is read by a POS terminal, 
your card, number, expiration 
date, and transaction amount 
are transmitted to the retailers 
acquiring bank via telephone 
lines, a dedicated ISDN line, 
or an Internet connection. The 
acquiring banks computer can 
tell what type of credit card you 
have from your account number. 
American Express numbers start 
with 37, Diners Club with 38, 
Visa with 4, MasterCard with 5, 
and Discover with 6, for exam
ple. The account and transaction 
data are then transmitted over 
bank networks to the appropri
ate corporation. For bank cards 
like Visa and MasterCard, the 
data is forwarded again to the 
particular bank that issued your 
card. Your account information 
and available credit are then 
confirmed or denied, and the 
information follows the same 
path back to the retailers POS 
terminal in a matter of seconds. 
Authorization of an Internet 
transaction is similar its retail 
analog, only theres frequently 
an additional step  larger on
line stores usually have the ca
pability to communicate directly 
with their acquiring bank, but 
smaller operations send their 
authorization requests via the 
Internet to a company known as 
an Internet payment gateway. 
The only function of a gateway is 
to receive securely-transmitted 
authorization requests over the

Internet from online merchants 
and transmit it to the merchants 
acquiring bank via traditional 
methods, and vice versa. In either 
the retail or Internet scenario, 
all the transactions for a day are 
usually settled in a batch every 
evening  the exception being 
Internet purchases for physical 
products that dont get shipped 
on the same day  and the funds
end up in the merchants ac
count at the acquiring bank. The 
acquiring bank makes money 
by charging the merchant a fee, 
usually around three percent, 
on every credit card transaction. 
The acquirer pays the card issuer 
a smaller fee, also based on the 
dollar amount of the transaction.
If you order merchandise over 
the phone, the process works 
a little differently. Because the 
product doesnt get shipped im
mediately, theres no immediate 
need for authorization. Mer
chants can authorize all of a days 
transactions in batch at the end of 
the day, so they dont even need 
a separate phone line for credit 
card authorizations. Transactions 
are also settled in end-of-the-day 
batches, but not until after the 
product has been shipped. Al
though authorizations are for a 
specific dollar amount, there is 
usually 10 to 15 percent leeway,
so the settlement delay allows for 
the addition of* things like ship
ping charges, which may not have 
been known at the time of autho
rization. The other difference be
tween retail and phone, mail, or 
Internet transactions is that in the 
latter cases, when the card isnt 
physically present, additional in
formation is submitted with the 
authorization request, to help 
eliminate fraud. This usually in
cludes the cardholders street ad
dress, ZIP code, and a three-digit 
number printed on the back of the 
card called a Card Verification 
Value 2, Card Validation Code, 
or Customer Identifier. By re
quiring information not printed 
on the front of the card, these 
schemes make it harder to make a 
purchase with stolen information.
Despite all these safeguards, 
credit card fraud still happens 
all the time, so its important for 
credit card users to be careful. If
you lose a card, report it to the 
card issuer immediately. Cut old 
credit cards into several pieces 
before discarding them. Make 
your telephone transactions 
from a land line rather than a 
cell phone. Perhaps most impor
tantly, remember not to transmit 
your credit card information in an 
unencrypted e-mail message or 
enter it into websites that arent 
secure (the URL will say https:// 
rather than http:// if its secure).

which seals and polar bears live 
and hunt will continue to re

Other native species are expected 
to see a change in distribution, 
and a number of them might face 
endangerment or possible extinc
tion.
After the initial barrier of al
tered movement is dealt with, 
some Arctic areas will be able to 
benefit from the climate change. 
Northern fisheries will have in

marine life movement, and there 
will be easier marine access to 
natural resources like oil and gas. 
Shipping during the summer will 
eventually become easier as more 
of the ice coverage turns to water. 
Warming will lead to more suc
cessful growing seasons due to 
the negation of some of the past 
cold-weather obstacles for crop 
production.
The report carries the predic
tion that humans living in the 
Arctic will be affected in most 
aspects of everyday life. These 
effects depend largely on the 
give-and-take of the positive and 
negative impacts of the climate
processing
change. One current problem is 
that permafrost, ground that is 
permanently frozen, is already 
becoming unstable. Right now, 
the permafrost is warming very 
rapidly. At the present point, in
some places, its already thaw
ing, said Dr. Romanovsky, a pro
fessor of geology and geophysics 
at the University of Alaska and a 
contributor to the permafrost sec
tion of the report. Shifting perma
frost can crack the foundations of 
buildings, threaten the stability of 
pipes, and fracture roads. Its a 
slow but very steady process, and 
very difficult to stop it if it starts, 
said Dr. Romanovsky.
In the past, IPCC Assessments 
and other independent reports 
have been presented to the United 
Nations Framework Convention 
on Climate Change and distrib
uted to policymakers in various 
governments. Their results have 
been far-reaching, encouraging 
many countries to take up the 
Kyoto Protocol and work together 
to slow the progress of devastat
ing climate change.
Many experts believe that the 
issue will inevitably fall into and 
end up in the hands of everyday 
citizens. Human activity now can 
reduce the rate of change to come 
in the future, said Dr. Gordon 
McBean, a geography and politi
cal science professor at the Uni
versity of Western Ontario who 
served as a contributing author to 
the report. According to Dr. Mc
Bean, apathy to climate change 
could be dangerous. What I 
have seen indicates that people 
want this problem to be solved, 
but they are often reluctant if it 
means that they personally have 
to make changes.

UDC policies put students 
at an unfair disadvantage
The University Committee on 
Discipline (UDC) is an important admin
istrative body, yet it is not widely under
stood. The Editorial Board feels that 
the unchecked power the UDC wields, 
as well as the secrecy that pervades the 
UDC proceedings, is detrimental to the 
health of the University community. With 
this editorial, The Tartan begins a multi
week series examining the workings of 
the UDC.
From the Carnegie Mellon Code: 
Students at Carnegie Mellon, because they 
are members of an academic community 
dedicated to the achievement of excellence, 
are expected to meet the highest standards 
of personal ethical and moral conduct 
possible. These standards require personal 
integrity, a commitment to honesty with
out compromise, as well as truth without 
equivocation and a willingness to place the 
good of the community above the good of 
the self.
The (UDC) has the largest scope of the 
three Judicial Hearing Boards, the other 
two being the Residence Hall Judicial 
Board and the Greek Judicial Board. The 
UDCs jurisdiction covers all cases poten
tially resulting in suspension or expul
sion; appeals of academic sanctions by 
university departments or decisions by 
other disciplinary boards; or situations 
in which a member of the campus com
munity files charges against a Carnegie 
Mellon student for an alleged violation of 
the University community standards and 
personal harm.
Last Wednesday, in the cramped, 
goldfish-cracker-strewn basement of 
Shirley Apartments, Student Dormitory 
Council (SDC) failed to approve emu TVs 
request for money to extend its services 
to campus. The sparsely attended meet
ing lost quorum when a member left 
early, and a vote on emu TVs appeal was 
delayed for a third time.
This is the latest in a series of fumbles 
by SDC. An organization that cant keep 
track of how many members it has in a 
room at one time is a troubled organiza
tion indeed. How is it possible that they 
are responsible for tens of thousands of 
dollars if they cant even manage their 
own meetings? And it is not as though 
this is an aberration in an otherwise solid 
track record. SDC has failed their con
stituents for quite some time.
SDCs responsibilities are increasingly 
veering away from concerns with resi
dence halls and student life and are be
coming scattered and politically moti
vated. SDC seems to put most of their 
energy into their Saturday films, Booth, 
and Buggy. Housing concerns, particu
larly those involving recreational equip
ment and hall activities, are frequently 
reported as being ignored or dismissed by 
SDC members.
Every student in campus housing pays 
$14 that contribute to the dorm activi
ties fee, for which SDC is responsible. 
This money should clearly be delegated 
to projects and events that could ben
efit students in Housing. It is hugely dis
appointing that a project like cmuTV, 
which would directly benefited residents, 
has been so flippantly cast aside. What
Intrinsic problems exist in the UDC 
process itself. The committees jurisdic
tion is so great that it can hear a case 
even when the facts of a situation are in 
dispute. Fact-finding policies are poorly 
defined and students can find themselves 
facing charges based on false informa
tion of which they have little ability to 
correct.
There is minimal recourse for cases 
that go directly to the UDC. Overturning 
a decision of the UDC requires the author
ity of the Vice President for Enrollment 
or the University President; without a 
legitimate appeal process, civil litigation 
against the Universitywhich, for most, 
is prohibitively expensive  is the only 
recourse for those involved. There should 
be an initial hearing or lower committee 
in place if the Committees decision is to 
remain as absolute as it is.
Being party to a UDC hearing is extraor
dinarily stressful, and causes undue harm 
to defendants; it is enough to destroy the 
academics of an entire semester. Cases 
are even heard during finals, depriv
ing potentially innocent students of their 
right to demonstrate their understanding 
of the course material.
One of the largest controversies sur
rounding the UDC is its gag order. No 
party involved  complainant, respon
dent, or any panelist  can speak to any 
other party about any proceeding, result, 
or punishment. This secrecy is impor
tant in matters involving some students 
rights to privacy, but the policy fails 
to address the communitys continuing 
need for awareness of its surroundings.
is more suspicious is that a substantial 
chunk of the dorm activities fee goes 
directly towards SDCs own activities. 
SDC spends a large chunk of money on 
Carnival Booth and Buggy; two years ago 
the organization selfishly spent upwards 
of $6000 on its own Buggy Team.
Reports of embezzlement cast an even 
darker shadow over SDCs allocation of 
the dorm activities fee. When a wide
screen television originally purchased for 
a dormitory goes home with one of an 
organizations members, its time for an 
external audit.
The SDC funding chair is frequently 
absent from meetings at which other or
ganizations request money for residentrelated activities. At the most recent 
meeting, the funding chair fooled 
around, sitting on the presidents lap. 
A governing body must take its job far 
more seriously.
SDC should seriously consider cmuTVs 
request for funding. This process has 
dragged on far too long and done noth
ing but show how poorly SDC operates. 
cmuTVs proposal to go to 24-hour broad
casts offers value to residents.
Students in Housing need to be more 
aware of how SDC operates. Instead of 
being responsible stewards of the dorm 
activities fee, this is an organization that 
is more dedicated to its own social activi
ties. SDC meetings must be more profes
sional and accessible to students. SDC 
must not be permitted to use dorm ac
tivities fee for its own Booth and Buggy 
endeavors. Its time for SDC to remember 
that they are supposed to serve students, 
not just themselves.
This letter is in response to [Pimps 
and Hos costumes no laughing matter,

Ms. Bhagats allegation that the 
Taiwanese Students Association sends 
the message that prostitution is fun and 
okay is preposterous.
Halloweenhas, over the years, evolved 
into an American cultural event. We do 
not celebrate our desire to actually be 
vampires, witches, or werewolves. The 
basis behind dressing up for Halloween 
is the excitement that comes with being, 
for-just one day, someone who you are 
not.
Suddenly, Ms. Bhagat says that an 
organization that condones dressing up 
is out of line. Somehow, encouraging 
a theme that students embrace means 
that TSA is comparable to a Nazi hate 
organization. This is a ridiculous anal
ogy and does not accurately reflect the 
context in which TSA promotes these 
parties.
The Taiwanese Students Association 
promoted the T3 party under the pimps 
and hoes theme because this has al
ways been a student body favorite. We 
merely cater to the tastes of the partygoers. This is how parties work, and 
this is a very simple concept. Collegeage women come dressed in revealing 
clothes not because they scoff at the 
plight of prostitutes, but simply because 
they want to come dressed in revealing 
clothes. We dont encourage it, we capi
talize on it.
Suggesting that TSA members are 
so sheltered that they have never en
countered a prostitute is laughable. By 
accusing the TSA organizers of being a 
part of a social class that separates them 
from the harsh realities of being pimped 
out is an erroneous and prejudiced as
sumption.
It has recently been brought to our 
attention that Student Senate is con
cerned that Student Activities would
The chill on academic 
discourse and freedom
In November 2001, Lynne Cheney, 
wife of the Vice President, and Senator 
Joe Lieberman (D-Conn.), as founding 
members of the academic watchdog 
group American Council of Teachers 
and Alumni (ACTA), sponsored the 
Defending Civilization report, a 
McCarthyesque blacklist of American 
professors, students, and others in the 
academic community who had spo
ken out against the war or the ad
ministration. (You can still read it at 
www.goacta.org/publications/Reports/ 
defciv.pdf.) The report is vicious in its 
condemnation of American professors 
who displayed a hatred of America, ap
parently, when they sponsored teachins that typically ranged from moral 
equivocation to explicit condemnations 
of America. While Americas elected 
officials from both parties and media 
commentators from across the spec
trum condemned the attacks and fol
lowed the President in calling evil by its 
rightful name, many faculty demurred. 
Some refused to make judgments. Many 
invoked tolerance and diversity as anti
dotes to evil. Some even pointed accusa
tory fingers, not at the terrorists, but at 
America itself.
To be sure, there was indeed a seg
ment of the American people who op
posed the Presidents reaction to the 
9/11 tragedy, and a percentage of that 
population hesitant about marching in 
lockstep with the President was em
ployed in the academic profession. 
Some of these professors may even have 
crossed the line into absurdity in their
fund an organization that would hold 
such a party. Our message is this: It is 
already clear to us, among many oth
ers, that the T3 Halloween party does 
not promote prostitution. Regardless of 
whether this partys theme is consistent 
with the interests of the University at 
large, taking away our right to hold it 
would be identical to censoring the very 
article that condemns us.

This letter is in response to [Delta 
Tau Delta damages both house and rep
utation, 11/8].
I regret any ill effects the actions 
taken by some DTD brothers had on the 
CMU community, as the University and 
Student Life have been very supportive 
of the chapter in this difficult time, but 
The Tartan portrayed the events inac
curately and out of context. The actions 
taken by some brothers were not aimed 
at the University; if anything they were 
aimed at DTD National. No one should 
pass judgment on the DTD brothers 
without first trying to understand their 
situation: someone they didnt even 
know forced them out of their home, 
and they could only watch as their let
ters were taken down.
I am upset that erroneous information 
was presented as factual in the article. 
Hammers were not used to damage the 
chapter house and the Campus Police 
were not dispatched. I am further dis
appointed that the Editorial Board did 
not contact anyone from DTD National, 
active brothers, alumni, or the CMU ad
ministration. Had it done so, the Board 
would have known that the major rea
son for removing Delta Tau Delta from 
CMUs campus was that DTD National 
disapproved of CMUs policies regard
ing fraternities and did not believe that
passionate reactions, but the ACTA re
port explicitly targets professors who 
advocated tolerance and diversity, who 
refused to make judgments, and who 
demurred from joining the Presidents 
suspicious, under-thought Crusade 
(this was his word). Professors earned 
places on this list for comments as in
nocuous as we should build bridges 
and relationships, not simply bombs 
and walls, I deplore those who are 
deploying rhetoric and deploying troops 
without thinking before they speak, 
and an eye for an eye leaves the whole 
world blind.
Universities came under criticism in 
the report for allowing teach-ins and 
antiwar speakers, or for providing a 
diversity-based curriculum. Included 
in the report is a quote from a speech 
Cheney gave on October 5, 2001: To 
say that it is more important now [to 
study Islam] implies that the events 
of September 11 were our fault, that 
it was our failure to understand Islam 
that led to so many deaths and so much 
destruction.
Over the following three years, this 
document was used to isolate and 
frighten professors who were deemed 
insufficiently patriotic, to discourage 
the creation of non-traditional courses, 
and to silence academic dissenters with 
vague threats. The report was used to 
target reprisals as professors across the 
U.S. were reprimanded, harassed, hu
miliated, flamed in e-mail, threatened 
with violence, and even fired for espous
ing strong anti-administration views, 
and came to a head in 2003, when 
HR 3077 brought the Title VI provision 
under review. Title VI mandates that 
programs receiving federal money train
our campus was a safe place for a DTD 
chapter. The Tartan must make it more 
clear that pieces such as the DTD article 
are strictly opinion-based editorials and 
that they are written by the Editorial 
Board, so they are less likely to be per
ceived as factual.
The Tartan has never given the 
Greek community the positive press it 
deserves. I have read articles with false 
information, hearsay, and rumors sim
ply to attract readers; the consequences 
are continual negative impressions of 
the chapters on CMUs campus. The fra
ternities and sororities on CMUs cam
pus raise thousands upon thousands of 
dollars for charity each year, perform 
countless hours of community service, 
and provide an invaluable social outlet 
for the entire campus. Unfortunately, 
The Tartan ignores these positive as
pects of the Greek community, and in
stead focuses on the few mistakes that 
our Greek organizations make.

On election day, we worked for 
MoveOn.org at the polling place at 
Schenley Golf Course where a large 
number of CMU students were sup
posed to vote. Because of registration 
mixups and inadequate preparation for 
the huge student voter turnout, many 
students had to wait in line to vote for 
over two hours  and for parts of the 
day had to brave downpours to get 
there or get back to campus. Without 
exception, students were incredibly pa

service. ACTA, acting on behalf of the 
White House, advocated the creation of 
an advisory board which would moni-ili 
tor these programs to ensure they met zA 
the federal mandate; the clear purpose 
of this board was to evaluate whether 
universities were representing conser
vative foreign policy. It could recom
mend pulling funding from programs 
that employed professors critical of the 
administration. Historically, the Bush 
White House is known for stocking such 
advisory boards with unqualified cor
porate shills or demagogues in order to 
ensure a particular agenda. Such boards 
have been instructed to distort and sup
press scientific data and other findings.
(A recent example of this was the 2004 
appointment of W. David Hager, a pro
life activist who advocates a biblical 
approach to medicine that has flown 
in the face of scientific understanding, 
to chair the FDAs Reproductive Health 
Drugs Advisory Committee.)
Such a climate on the academic side 
encourages the proliferation of orga
nizations like Campus Watch, which 
puts out inflammatory and mislead
ing dossiers on professors critical of 
the Bush administration and advo
cates anti-Muslim ethnic cleansing in 
America. Such a climate legitimizes 
the work of conservative activists like 
David Horowitz, whose academic bill 
of rights is the centerpiece of an ongo
ing effort to silence liberal voices on 
American campuses.
These facts are not in dispute. The ad
ministration is open about, and proud 
of, its actions against the intellectual

The Natrat Commission Forum 
took place last Wednesday with a 
small but effective turnout. The 
attendees, who included mem
bers of SPIRIT, an alumnus of the 
Delta Tau Delta fraternity, and 
many from the administration, 
brough up a number of important 
issues.
One important concernbrought 
up was the fact-checking of ar
ticles. This process is currently 
done by the author of the article 
and then by proofreaders, section 
editors, and the Editor-in-Chief. 
Fact-checking in the content of 
the paper is an issue of which I 
have been very aware for a num
ber of years. I personally have 
had an instance where something
with which I was involved was re
ported entirely inaccurately. This 
is a problem that is not as easily 
solved as it may seem. For issues 
such as news or science-and-tech
nology topics, all facts are objec
tive and relatively easy to check 
for accuracy. The real problems 
are presented when on-campus 
news is being reported, specifi
cally breaking news or news that 
requires access to police reports, 
another topic addressed during 
the forum, which has since been 
resolved. One of the contribu
tions that I, as well as Mark, the 
executive officer of the paper, 
have made is to use our connec
tions with the campus to ensure 
the writers have the appropriate 
sources to allow all facts reported 
to be accurate and fair, and ideally this happens every time. In 
fact, the number of complaints 
regarding poor fact-checking has 
greatly decreased this semester. 
However, The Tartan can only 
have so many connections and 
resources from which to draw 
information.
The other issue raised was the 
community and The Tartans role 
regarding the recommendations 
for the broader community, com
monly referred to as Charge 3, 
in the Natrat report. Saying that 
the recommendations are com
monly referred to as Charge 3 
may be misleading, since only a 
small group of people have paid 
attention to the report as to know 
exactly what Charge 3 is; the 
conversation addressed this very 
issue. The dean of H&SS, John
Lehoczky, said that many observ
ers, including himself, thought 
that massive changes would 
occur within the community in 
the year following the Natrat con
troversy, but that in fact the op
posite has occurred. It seems that 
very few students are interested 
in giving the issue the time and 
thought that it warrants. It was 
pointed out, and I firmly agree, 
that the Tartan has the ability 
and necessity to take major steps 
towards positively bringing the 
issues back to students atten
tion. This concerns not only the 
racism facet of the problem but 
all of the aspects that this com
munity often neglects. We ac
cept that this may be a difficult 
task, but I feel it is our duty to 
take it on.
The Tartan and I will continue 
to work on discussing and imple
menting the suggestions made in 
the commissions report. We will 
also begin to look for any way 
to effectively bring this issue to 
every students attention.
Any input that you as a reader 
have on this subject would be 
greatly appreciated.
As for future forums, we will 
most likely hold another in the 
coming months; however, to re
iterate, if you have any input of 
which you would like the edi
torial staff to be aware, please 
do not hesitate to make contact. 
Your thoughts and concerns are 
always welcome here.

violation of civil rights. All these facts are 
very real and very disturbing to me. How
ever, there are alternate explanations for 
President Bushs perceived shortcomings, 
besides the Pavlovian response Bush is an 
Idiot.
The economy is very complex and unpre
dictable in nature. If you could break down 
GDP or any other economic indicator (say, 
unemployment rates) into a linear model, 
it would be very obvious to see that there 
are nearly an infinite number of variables, 
many of which are out of the control of any 
sort of federal regulation. To place the re
sponsibility entirely on the Presidents eco
nomic policies by measuring the perfor
mance of the economy in a given period is 
ludicrous. Blaming President Bush for the 
recession and economic downturn is com
parable to condemning Clinton for facili
tating the preceding technology bubble.
Homeland Security is also very impor
tant to the American people. John Kerry 
declared that President Bush outsourced 
the capture of the worlds most infamous 
terrorist, Osama bin Laden, to Afghan war
lords. This is very misleading, as demon
strated in a recent article in The Wall Street 
Journal by Lt. Gen. Michael DeLong. DeLong, the general in charge of the opera
tion to capture Bin Laden, declared that 
U.S. forces were in command the entire
time, only seeking help from the local war
lords.
What of the use of fear tactics by the 
Bush administration? The terror alert lev
els incited responses ranging from ridicule 
by late-night television shows to anxiety by 
panicky citizens. Colors are no good; the 
American people want a prediction. We 
dont want to hear about increased chat
ter among terrorist operatives. We want 
a solid answer rather than a vague warn
ing. But of course, there is almost never a 
clear-cut answer to our questions until af
terwards. And then of course, with the aid 
of hindsight glasses, we condemn those 
who are responsible for not properly warn
ing us.
And finally, weve all heard the whole 
wrong war at the wrong place at the 
wrong time rhetoric. Now we know that 
there are no weapons of mass destruction 
in Iraq, and our American brothers and 
sisters may have died for no reason other 
than a massive intelligence failure. Does 
this, however, mean that President Bush 
made the wrong decision to disarm Sad
dam Hussein? Hindsight is always 20/20. 
Given the possibility that a dictator who 
has reason to hate the United States, who 
has a history of misleading UN inspectors, 
and who is suspected to have weapons of 
mass destruction; should any President sit
idly by?
People tend to forget that, sometimes, 
good decisions can result in bad outcomes. 
And what course of action would Kerry 
have taken? Create a coalition of the will
ing before proceeding any further? Insist 
on a multilateral force before pursuing a 
potential national security threat? Some
times, a leader needs to have the resolve to 
make a decision alone.
So what does all this mean? Clearly, this 
editorial full of explanations and rebuttals 
may not convince you that President Bush 
was the right choice for America. What it 
boils down to isnt a stance on a certain 
subject, nor is it a position on a certain 
issue. What is important is simply charac
ter. An outstanding President is a model of 
integrity, strength, and resolve. The Presi
dent has shown, from his past four years, 
that he is not going to waver in the face of 
challenges up ahead. Good decisions do 
not always result in perfect outcomes, but 
the people will always favor the man who 
will always be brave enough to make the 
right decision.

It has been thirteen days, and liberals 
still cannot comprehend how their chosen 
one fell to the incoherent and incompe
tent incumbent. How was it that a simple 
man, who struggles to speak with proper 
grammar, defeated a sharp and articu
late war hero? Perhaps it was dissention 
in the ranks of the Democrats. Maybe the 
scare tactics by the Bush administration 
worked. No, it must have been the Ameri
cans from the South, with their inferior 
IQ scores, who made the wrong choice 
that will destroy our country for the next 
four years. Despite these analyses, leftwing political pundits have overlooked 
the unambiguous solution worthy of Ock
hams razor. Perhaps George W. Bush is 
the better president.
Before you tear up this paper and rip 
your hair out in agony, I should explain 
myself. I recognize that President Bush 
presided over the largest net loss of jobs 
since Herbert Hoover. I admit that the war 
in Iraq may have been fought for not-sohumanitarian reasons. I concede the fact 
that his proposed constitutional amend

Since the Natrat Commission 
published its findings, there has 
been a rush to form committees, 
discussion groups, and forums on 
diversity. These attempts have a 
lot of overlap, and many share the 
same sustentative issues in their 
formation and targeted goals. 
However, these goals are some
times unclear in their motivation, 
and potentially misguided. Diver
sity is a fantastic objective, but a 
top-down implementation will be 
counterproductive.
There exists a radical faction of

believe they can force diversity

The issue contained articles and 
satires, one of which drew par

that spawned the Presidential 
Commission on issues raised by 
the Natrat.
This commission, armed with 
a mixture of purpose and anger, 
met frequently. The goal was to 
quell the anger over the Natrat 
issue, while fostering progres

campus. Much of the Presiden

matter was exemplary. However, 
buried in the commissions ori

problems. One of the first symp

action should be taken against

Morimotos food demo reveals CMU students unpolished ways
Alisha Bhagat
Last week, as part of the In
ternational Festival, hundreds of 
CMU students and their guests 
crowded McConomy Auditorium 
to observe a cooking demon
stration by Iron Chef Masaharu 
Morimoto. The cooking demo 
went on for two hours; all the 
while Morimoto and his assis
tant cooked a variety of complex 
dishes including fresh lobster 
and a sashimi platter. After the 
event there was some ambigu
ity as to what would happen to 
the food. To many peoples sur
prise, audience members rushed 
the stage, grabbed whatever 
they could with their hands, and 
devoured it.
During the event Morimoto had 
joked about the.possibility that it 
would be auctioned off. Many 
people, including myself, as
sumed that administrators would 
get to eat the food or that it would 
be assigned randomly based on 
ticket number, or even that the 
first two rows would be asked to 
stay after everyone else left and 
would then get to eat the food. 
Any of these options would have 
been acceptable. Instead, people 
felt the need to charge the stage 
and to cram down their throats in 
seconds what it had taken Mori
moto hours to produce.
One student ran up and 
grabbed half a lobster. Others 
planted themselves in a choice 
position and began eating. One 
participant admitted to pushing 
and clawing just to get one piece
of sashimi. People even walked 
off with the ingredients such as 
the raw wasabi root. Morimoto 
was our guest at CMU, and stu
dents took his art and destroyed 
it. No one who was a part of the 
feeding frenzy was able to savor 
the food or give it the attention 
that a two-hour preparation de
manded. In short, the behavior of 
students after the demo was com
pletely unacceptable.
While there were many rea
sons for the appalling incident 
after the cooking demo, I think 
the occurrence speaks to a bigger 
problem on our campus: the way 
CMU students react to food. Food 
is a major problem on this campus 
beyond simply having more din
ing options. Many students seem 
to lack the knowledge of how to 
enjoy food and eat it in a civil 
manner.
Having written several food re
views for the The Tartan, I know 
that good food is available close 
to campus and it is available quite 
cheaply. The majority of CMU stu
dents can afford food  perhaps 
not food of Iron Chef quality, but 
basic sustenance. So our students 
should not become frenzied at 
the sight of food. Even though 
students occasionally treat food 
as a necessity, they care deeply 
about its quality, as evidenced by 
yearly complaints about Dining 
Services.
If people care enough about 
food to demand better-quality 
food on campus, they should care 
about creating a positive food at
mosphere. What happened at the 
Iron Chef event was disgusting 
and can be seen in various degrees 
at some other free food events on 
campus. Most of us can remember
Iron Chef Morimoto was overwhelmed by students at his International Food Festival demo, who quickly devoured the meal he had prepared.
a time where some food was be
ing given away for free at an event 
or meeting and people made a 
mad rush for it. I can personally 
attest to being present at events 
where pizza was served and some 
people grabbed three slices and 
gobbled them up one after the 
other, while people slower to get 
to the food got none. Ive even 
asked friends why they always 
eat free pizza even after they are 
sick of it. They responded that be
cause its free they feel compelled 
to eat it. As a campus, we need to 
get out of this mentality.
Imagine if after the cooking 
demonstration, instead of every
one running for the food, some
one stood up and announced that 
the food was for the people in the 
first row and they took it calmly 
into another room. The food 
could have been given the atten
tion it ought to have had and the 
diners would have had a much
better experience.
Its almost paradoxical how 
people who watched the skill and 
care Morimoto put into cooking 
for two hours could treat food 
in that manner. We all need to 
change the way we think about 
food. As college students we all 
eat food in class sometimes and 
perhaps skip meals occasionally. 
This is normal. What isnt normal 
is a feeding frenzy at the sight 
of free food. We arent victims
V ' - *'  v 'X
or starvation; we aren t povertym 
stricken. We can afford to treat' 
food in a more dignified way. 
Food is a wonderful part of life; 
it brings us together as people. 
We need to give it and our fellow 
diners the attention and courtesy 
they deserve.

longer dismiss Bush as an accident, as the product

of America, apparently these values include the si

Bush has his so-called mandate, we can certainly 
expect the next four years to bring an intensified chill

Top-down implementation of diversity will not work
DIVERSITY, from A7
the uglier side of policy driven diver
sity.
In the wake or the Presidential 
Commissions report, subsequent 
committees have formed. Student 
Senate recently formed an ad hoc 
committee on diversity. Greek Coun
cil now has a Diversity Coordinator 
who works on projects in the name of 
diversity. These projects are relatively 
new, and one should be optimistic 
about the hope for advancement that 
they bring.
To those thinking of changing the 
world one committee at a time, here 
is some advice: Alienating elements 
of the community from the discussion 
on diversity is the most dangerous 
mistake that could be made, whether 
it occurs by dealing out harsh punish
ments or by believing that any one 
committee will be able to address 
the problem alone. The commit
tees dealing with diversity must be 
watched carefully, just as any legisla
tor or judge pushing social change or 
reform must be kept in check. Free
dom of speech and free will must be 
protected by incorporating thoughts 
from a broad spectrum of community 
members. The sacrifice of debate re
sults in radical changes; the hot-button issues of those in power cast aside 
the thoughts of the many. Respect 
and tolerance are earned through 
respectful debate.
Acting with such disregard is cer
tain to nullify a message of diversity. 
If the views of others are completely 
thrown away while advancing ones 
own agenda, failure is 'assured. The 
ends do not justify the means, espe
cially if the process of civil debate is 
discarded. The various committees 
must continue to advance diversity in 
all forms.
I am reminded of a story told re
cently. In the not too distant past, 
there was an RA on this very campus 
who was fired for making remarks
 remarks that were nothing more 
than an extension of his personal 
and religious beliefs. His remarks 
made homosexual members of his 
floor uncomfortable. This RA was 
asked to apologize or he would face 
disciplinary action. Well within his
moral bounds, he refused. He was 
subsequently dismissed from his post. 
While he may have been insensitive, 
this is exactly the type of force-fed po
litical correctness that every member 
of a society should fight in addition to 
advancing diversity.
One would have to wonder, were 
there a Muslim RA making antiChristian comments, would he be 
asked to apologize or be threatened 
with disciplinary action?
It is this double standard, this 
intolerance, that invalidates much 
of the diversity movement. To the 
surprise of many, there are many 
forward thinking persons who are 
deeply religious or strongly conser
vative. There are tolerant people that 
are willing to work towards progress 
through a process which emphasizes 
respect for beliefs as much as a need 
for change.
Saint Thomas Aquinas once said, 
Free will is the cause of its own 
movement, because by his free will 
man moves himself to act. Profound 
sentiments such as the above do 
not lend themselves to infringement 
upon the freedom of speech of others,
or to fascist coercion into capitulation 
with someone elses moral stances. 
To that point, our community must 
guard these freedoms to foster di
versity. Targeting those who are un
willing to abandon their beliefs and 
values to a movement rooted in radi
cal political correctness has to cease. 
There is nothing more infuriating 
than four guilty white guys sitting 
in a board room, dictating diversity 
policy onto a constituency they de
fine as closed-minded and narrow. 
There is hope for tolerance and di
versity, and it will only be realized 
by respecting free will and diversity 
of thought.

The mens soccer team dropped 
a 1-1 decision in overtime, losing 
4-3 on penalty kicks, on Saturday 
to the Allegheny College Gators 
in the second round of the NCAA 
Tournament.
Within the first five minutes 
of the game Gator Josh Johnson 
sent the ball to the far post of the 
goal, giving the Gators a 1-0 lead. 
However, less than eight min
utes later CMU sophomore for
ward Andrew Park sent the ball 
to sophomore forward Jonathan 
Browne, who headed the ball past 
Gator goalie Brian Manougian. 
The goal, Brownes 20th of the 
year, tied up the game 1-1.
Allegheny held the advantage 
in the first half with eight shots 
while Carnegie Mellon had five. 
However, the Tartans fired back 
in the second half with a 6-3 shot 
advantage.
Allegheny had a few chances 
to end the game in the second
overtime as two Gators each took 
shots on the upper comers of the 
goal. However, senior keeper Dave 
Thomas stopped both attempts, in 
addition to stopping six shots all 
together.
The score would remain tied at 
the end of regulation as well as 
through two ten-minute periods 
of overtime. This forced the game 
to go into a penalty kick shootout. 
The Gators defeated the Tartans 
in penalty kicks with a score of 
A3.
Carnegie Mellon began the 
shootout as senior forward James 
Steidel and junior midfielder 
Dan Matalski both scored on the 
Gators. Senior defenseman Alex 
Beck gave CMU its last goal in the 
shootout to the lower left corner.
CMU had a chance to put the 
pressure on Allegheny, however, 
senior defenseman Joe Artusos 
shot hit the bottom of the crossbar 
and bounced away. At this point 
the score was tied; then Gator 
Marc Sciulli scored past Thomas, 
thus winning the shootout and

Tartan football ends season with win against Rhodes
by Kevin LaBuz
Staffwriter
After the team lost three of its 
first four games, some football 
fans may have written off the 
Tartans. After recently losing two 
consecutive conference games to 
Case Western and Washington 
University, some might have said 
that their season was over.
While the Tartans will not be 
eligible for postseason play this 
year, it was evident from their 
play against the Rhodes College 
Lynx (5-5) on Saturday that the 
Tartans would not sell themselves 
short.
The Tartans began the game 
from their own 26-yard line and 
started off by handing the ball 
to first-year running back Colby 
Whitman, who gained seven 
yards. The following play, a pass 
by senior Jarrod Highberger, 
was overthrown. On third down 
Highberger rushed to the outside 
and was able to pick up the first 
down before being knocked out 
of bounds.
Next, with the speed of both 
Whitman and Highberger, the 
Tartans were able to pick up a 
first down. A 14-yard rush by 
Highberger moved the Tartans 
into Lynx territory.
Three plays later, on third and 
seven, Highberger dropped back 
to pass, and as he threw the ball, 
he was hit by Rhodes sophomore 
linebacker Will Bartholomew, 
who recorded a sack and forced 
a fumble. The fumble was recov
ered by Rhodes senior defensive 
end Ken Coward, and a footrace
ensued. Coward was able to beat 
several Tartans to the end zone 
for a touchdown. After missing 
the point after, Rhodes led the 
game by six points.
A kickoff return of 11 yards 
by senior running back Joe Hur
ley, coupled with a short kick 
by Rhodes senior kicker Hunter 
Tigert, gave the Tartans a de
cent field position. The Tartans, 
however, were not able to take 
advantage of it, and after losing 
one yard on three plays they were 
forced to punt.
Neither team was able to es
tablish a lengthy drive until late 
in the first quarter. A 37-yard 
pass from senior Rhodes quar
terback Justin Sealand to sopho
more receiver Michael Hatcher, 
as well as solid contributions on 
the ground by first-year running 
back lyier Lake, led to a 17-play, 
78-yard drive that ended with a 
25-yard field goal by Tigert, giv
ing Rhodes a nine-point lead.
Highberger finished the game 
completing none of his four 
passes  very out of character 
 and as a result, the offense was 
stagnant.
After the Rhodes field goal, 
Highberger was replaced by 
sophomore quarterback Kevin 
Mulkern, who played well last 
week against Bethany.
This was the turning point of 
the game, as Mulkern was able to 
be an offensive catalyst, display
ing both a powerful arm and the 
ability to pick up yards on the 
ground.
Mulkerns first drive resulted 
in a touchdown. First-year full
back Travis Sivek had 27 yards

on the drive, including a ten-yard 
touchdown run. Mulkern and ju
nior running back Jon Cakert also 
contributed on the drive, which 
went for 65 yards. A successful 
point after attempt by sophomore 
kicker Nathaniel Greenstein cut 
Rhodes lead to two points.
We felt we needed a change, 
a spark, said head coach Rich 
Lackner, referring to his substitu
tion of Mulkern for Highberger.

the ball well with him, so we de
cided to keep him in.
From this point on, the Tartan 
offense and defense both pro
ceeded to dominate the game. 
The offense was able to score 
three more touchdowns as well 
as a field goal by Greenstein. The 
defense only allowed Rhodes six 
more points.
Sivek finished the game with 98 
yards and scored three of the four 
touchdowns; Whitman scored the 
other. The Tartan ground game 
netted 264 yards. Solid contribu
tions on the ground  aside from 
Siveks and Whitmans  came 
from Cakert, who had 69 yards, 
and Mulkern, who had 56.
Mulkern was also effective in 
the passing game, completing 
five of seven passes for a total of 
141 yards. Three of these passes 
went to sophomore receiver Mark 
Davis, who finished with 119 re
ceiving yards.
Despite fumbling the ball seven 
times, and losing four of these, 
the team offense was able to 
score 31 points.
The defense, which has been 
the backbone of the team all sea
son, provided another solid game. 
They gave up only nine points 
and kept the Lynx to 246 total 
yards  92 on the ground and 
154 in the air.
The defensive effort was lead 
by senior and team captain Adam 
Lovrovich, who had four tackles 
as well as one interception and

Womens soccer wins the ECAC 
Southern Region championship
by Khalid El-Arini
Staffwriter
For the second year in a row, the Carnegie 
Mellon womens soccer team ended its 
season by winning the ECAC Southern 
Region championship. After receiving a 
first round bye, the team went on to defeat 
Penn State Behrend in the semifinals and 
tournament host Johns Hopkins in the 
finals. The hero for the Tartans was junior 
forward Hallie Dumont, who logged two 
game-winning goals and was named the 
tournaments Most Outstanding Player.
On Friday, in a rematch of a regular sea
son match-up that Carnegie Mellon took 
3-0, the Tartans clashed with the Bears of 
Perm State Behrend and defeated them by 
a final score of 1-0. The games only goal 
came as first-year forward Kasey Stevers 
forceful shot ricocheted off the post, al
lowing Dumont to hit it into the back of 
the net for her first goal of the tournament. 
In the other semifinal, Johns Hopkins de
feated Gwynedd-Mercy 1-0, to ensure that 
the Tartans would have to beat the home 
squad in order to defend their title.
Yesterday, Carnegie Mellon defeated 
former University Athletic Association 
(UAA) rival Johns Hopkins 1-0. With just 
over seven minutes remaining in the first 
half, sophomore midfielder Lisa Pascoli 
fed the ball to Dumont, whose 25-yard 
volley beat the Blue Jays goalkeeper 
and proved to be the game-winner. The 
Tartans showed relentless pressure in the 
first half, but could not extend their lead. 
Johns Hopkins came close to tying the 
game several times in the second half, but 
the Blue Jays were thwarted by Carnegie 
Mellons strong defense and stellar play 
from senior goalkeeper Megan Monroe, 
whose two tournament shutouts bring her 
total to thirteen for the year.
Although the!Tartans could not creep
into the top 25 or NCAA tournament 
this year, their ECAC win solidified their 
standing as a regional powerhouse. They 
finished the regular season ranked 27th 
nationally among Division III schools. 
However, many teams that were ranked 
higher played far weaker schedules. As 
a mark of the UAAs strength, the three 
teams that finished ahead of the Tartans 
 Chicago, Washington, and Emory  all 
advanced to the NCAA tournament, with 
Chicago and Washington advancing to the 
Sectional (third) Round. The Tartans hope 
that they have reversed a lack of respect 
for the team by having such a strong show
ing this season.
We established ourselves as a good 
team this year, said senior midfielder 
Amy Tsao. In pre-season polls, they had 
us finishing in the bottom half of the UAA, 
but we finished in the top half. Weve 
gained respect this year.
Junior defender Margaret Beck said, 
Were disappointed about not making 
NCAAs, but were looking forward to a bet
ter season next year.
This season also saw immediate impact 
from the teams talented first-year play
ers. Stever was a menace to other teams 
defenders all season, logging five goals on 
the year. First-year defender Amanda Rose 
led the team in assists, and was part of a 
stingy defense which became a trademark 
of the team over the course of the season.
We had a great season, even though 
we had problems scoring, said Monroe. 
Since were only losing one starter, we 
should be in good position for next year. 
An unprecedented six Tartans were 
given all-conference honors by the UAA 
this year. Dumont, Monroe, Pascoli, and 
junior back Mollie Salpeter were named 
to the all-UAA second team, while Rose 
and junior midfielder Nadya Yaghoubi re
ceived honorable mentions.

campaign, 0-14 in the UAA, in 2003-04, 
it is understandable why they might want

in 1991).
Meanwhile, the Tartans set a 
new team record, recording at 
least one interception in every 
game of the season.
Senior defensive back Adam 
Wirth finished the game with 
one interception, while senior de
fensive back Adam Bowland had 
two; in addition, Bowland broke 
up two passes.
Wirth, junior linebacker Ja

finished the game with more than 
five tackles.
The Tartans concluded their 
season with a 31-15 win over 
Rhodes College and a record of 
6 and 4. This is the thirty-first 
consecutive non-losing season for 
the Tartans.
The seniors have given us ev
erything we have asked of them. 
They have been great role models 
for our younger guys, said Lack

of the season. Their efforts and 
loyalty to this program have been 
superb. All of them have had a 
significant role in our team and 
they have given us 100 percent at 
all times. They will be missed. 
Its sad [having played my last 
game], said Lovrovich. This is a 
great group of guys. Its the guys 
I wanted to go out with.
They certainly went out well.

Music students play for a cause
All Stars Cabaret fundraises for new practice rooms
The music and voice majors in the College of Fine 
Arts rely on the convenience of the practice rooms 
and reserved spaces where they can feel comfort
able to fall flat from time to time. However, the 
practice rooms in the CFA building have not been 
remodeled since 1989 and, due to rigorous use, 
are in need of repair. Several students in CFA who 
are members of the student government, as well 
as members of the newly developed Student Gov
ernment for Music, have chosen to raise funds 
to update the practice rooms, ensuring that the 
spaces where music majors spend so much time 
will remain pleasant ones.
Senior music majors Alison Crossley and Angela 
Occhionero and junior music major Michael 
Kooman have had a role in putting together a 
special cabaret to feature students from CFA. 
Along with Andrea Springer, Michael Certo (both 
seniors), and Vanessa Vansickle (a first-year), 
they make up the core of the students on Student 
Government for Music, which made the cabaret 
possible. Kooman described the group, clarifying, 
We dont have an association with any depart
ment outside music. We are a student initiative 
amongst the music majors to better the academic 
climate in the music department. Their perfor
mance, titled School of Music All-Stars Cabaret, 
will ask for a five-dollar donation from all attend
ees to help fund the renovations of the practice 
rooms. Occhionero explained why the renova
tions are something that students must take task 
with, rather than the administration: Right now 
they [the administration] have to redo the in
side of CFA, so theyre trying to focus on that. 
Kooman also noted that most music majors are 
always looking for opportunities to perform. In 
this case, they will be performing for a cause.
The project to restore the practice rooms was ini
tiated just this year, which is also the first year 
that Student Government for Music has been in 
existence. We wanted to have this project, since 
were a fairly new group, and our first concern was 
restoring the practice rooms, said Occhionero of 
the desire to create a clear direction for Student 
Government for Music. The group members em
phasized the need to make fundraising for the 
practice rooms into something that occurs each 
semester. In the future, the group hopes that they 
will be able to take different approaches to the 
fundraiser, so that it is not always a cabaret.
Danielle Saudino/Art Staff
Student Government for Music was the main co
ordinating force in the creation of the cabaret, 
with help from Alan Fletcher, who assisted by 
providing contacts, according to group members. 
The group is even hoping to advertise the event 
with WQED, if possible. Refreshments and cater
ing will be provided by campus catering, in ad
dition to the musical acts. It is utilizing a,lot of 
resources on campus, stated Crossley.
The event occurs this Friday in the Alumni Con
cert Hall. It will feature a smorgasbord of per
formances from students in the College of Fine 
Arts. Among them: solo performances by Rebekah Diaz, who will sing Do it Again; Rebecca 
Hadly, who will be performing a piece from the 
Broadway musical Wicked; and Aubrey OConner, 
who is performing a piece by Gershwin. Gersh
win appears again on the roster, as the jazz string 
quartet will be playing three selections from the 
composer as well. The cabaret will also feature 
a trombone quartet and jazz quintet, as well as 
the vocal trio of Morgan Springer, Alia Chaib, 
and Melanie Goerlitz, who will perform Love 
Changes Everything.
The night promises a range of musical perfor
mance with profits dedicated solely to the fund 
to renovate the practice rooms. So come out this 
Friday to the Alumni Concert Hall in CFA to help 
this cause.

A team of Tech chemists led by associate professor Truman Kohman discovered the 
first stable radioactive isotope of aluminum. The isotope, aluminum-26, allowed 
radioactive tracing that was not possible with earlier short-lived isotopes, which usu
ally decayed within minutes. Until this discovery, aluminum was one of the few basic 
elements without a radioactive isotope favorable to tracing.

Participation in student government elections improved to 14 percent from the previ
ous years 12.5 percent. In spite of the extremely low turnout, CIT had 320 votes filed 
and MIS had 145. SUPAs new Senator, however, was elected with only 14 votes, and 
her counterpart from GSIA had a mandate of only 11 students.

As a counter to the Universitys decision to eliminate so-called obscene newsgroups 
from campus, over 300 students protested on the steps of Warner Hall. Most speak
ers, including students, citizens of Pittsburgh, and ACLU representatives agreed that 
obscene material was not the most productive use of CMU computing facilities, but all 
acknowledged that censorship was not and had never been the solution to those prob
lems. As a result of the students action, only three newsgroups  those with graphic 
images  were removed.

Housing services and SDC announced a $1.9M addition to Hamerschlag House to pro
vide the Hill with its own meeting space and additional recreation space. New exercise 
rooms and study areas were planned to eliminate the need to go to Donner or a library, 
and a satellite Student Life office was planned to eliminate the need for east campus 
residents to trek to Morewood. Additional plans were added to convert part of the first 
floor of the Margaret Morrison Apartments complex to recreation space for residents 
of the Hill, Donner, and the apartments above.

Protesters descended on downtown primarily to protest the Free Trade Area of the 
Americas, a trade agreement similar to the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
Among the protesters were representatives of the ACLU and CMUs Progressive Student 
Alliance (PSA). The protest was organized by the Thomas Merton Center because of 
concern that elimination of regulations on trade between the United States and South 
American countries would cost thousands of jobs in the region. Despite endorsement 
by the PSA and a good turnout between 200 and 300 people, only four of the protestors 
were Carnegie Mellon Students.

Girasole serves up fantastic Italian
Shadyside restaurant offers great dining experience
Girasole in Shadyside
733 Copeland Street 
Pittsburgh, Pa. 15232 
412.682.2130
Italian restaurants are a dime a dozen. When dining out 
Americans choose Italian cuisine more than any other, 
save American itself. Italian restaurants are as common 
as McDonalds and are often no tastier. But there still 
exist a few fantastic Italian restaurants that serve up 
authentic Italian food in a homey atmosphere. Girasole, 
just off Walnut Street, is one such place. Even for Italian 
food skeptics like me, Girasole is well worth the trip.
BEVV204? 1 50,MS2MH eCCI?
Girasole is a small family restaurant tucked away next to 
C.Video and across the street from Starbucks. At night it 
has a cozy inviting feel. The walls lined in gray brick cre
ate a relaxed atmosphere. Even though Girasole is often 
considered a romantic restaurant, I found it livelier than 
most romantically-labeled restaurants. Girasole lacks 
the gende conversation and lighting featured by most 
romantic restaurants, in favor of a much more vibrant 
atmosphere. Even though it has limited floor space, the 
restaurant is crowded, even on weekdays. The clientele 
ranges from casually dressed Shadyside regulars to welldressed couples who discuss current events over glasses 
of wine, making Girasole the perfect restaurant for a 
refined group outing.

Chef Chris prepares a fiery Italian dish in the rear kitchen.
The soup of the day was potato-leek with arugula; it was 
hard to decide between that and the salad. I settled on 
the salad, a nice blend of fresh lettuce, chickpeas, and 
sunflower seeds. The soup my friends ordered was rich 
and hearty  a good way to start off a meal. The special 
of the day was mako shark. The thick cut of fish was 
cooked in a delicate sauce to the point where it melted 
in the mouth like butter. My choice, the sea scallop 
orichette, was good: The sea scallops were soft and tasty, 
but the pasta was a little tough. The dish was composed 
of large scallops in a pasta shells with a light white sauce 
and small tomato pieces. Since it is pumpkin season, one 
of my friends could not resist the pumpkin ravioli, and 
even though I am not a huge pumpkin fan, the dish was 
an interesting combination: creamy pumpkin in soft ravi
oli shells covered in a spinach sauce.
We were full and relaxed after our entrees but were con
vinced by the dessert menu to order more. Girasole is 
one of few places in Pittsburgh to serve the king of cold 
desserts: gelato. The mint chocolate chip gelato they 
served was somewhere between ice cream and sorbet, 
and utterly perfect. The pumpkin cheesecake was rich

While Garisole is expensive enough to be considered a high-end restaurant, the food is too good for students to pass up.

The entrees at Girasole are just perfect for one person, 
especially with the soup or salad starter. Entrees range in 
price from $12 to $20, and the food is good solid Italian 
cooking made from fresh ingredients. The owners and 
chef are very friendly and love to chat about their restau

vibe  in short, everything you could want in an Italian 
restaurant.

Upon getting settled, my group took a look at the wine 
list. Girasole has a small but decent wine list with some 
very affordable choices. Wines by the glass are also 
available. I chose the Chianti and was not disappointed
 it was fruity and not too dry. My companions began 
devouring the table bread, which was surprisingly soft. 
The menu at Girasole changes frequently and there is 
always a specials menu. The menu is small but well 
selected. There is a good representation of vegetarian 
dishes as well.

chocolate mousse, chocolate cake, and full cream icing, 
was very decadent  even a little too rich for my taste.

Unique artist performs at the Rex
Robyn Hitchcock Spooks out the audience
Robyn Hitchcock is an unfamiliar name to most people. 
Some may vaguely remember him as the guy who opened 
for R.E.M. once or as the guy who did Balloon Man, but 
to his devoted fans, his twenty plus-year musical career 
means much more. Hitchcocks unique approach to music 
has left an indelible mark. Known for the surreal imag
ery that saturates his lyrics and for his bizarre live banter 
between songs, the fifty-one year old English musician is 
one of rock musics true eccentrics. Whether Hitchcock is 
rocking out with his backing band, the Egyptians, or per
forming beautifully crafted songs accompanied by piano 
or acoustic guitar, the music he produces is dominated by 
absurdity, dark humor, and whimsical imagery.
His latest release, Spooked, is a collaboration with the 
American neo-traditionalist duo of Gillian Welch and David 
Rawlings, who give the album a more down-to-earth feel 
than that of Hitchcocks previous recordings. On first listen, 
the lyrics may seem less bizarre than usual, but the pres
ence of permafrost, demons, ghostly presences, and aliens 
make the music distinctly Hitchcockian. His trademark 
psychedelic tendencies remain intact in the song Every
body Needs Love, which features Hitchcock on sitar, and 
in the anthemic Were Gonna Live in the Trees. Spooked 
displays Hitchcocks ongoing maturation as a songwriter 
and stands as strong as his earlier acoustic albums I Often 
Dream of Trains and Eye.
Hitchcock performed at the Rex Theatre last Tuesday 
night. Although the event was only modestly attended, it 
was obvious by the T-shirts, British accents, and the shared

sense of excitement that the attendees were longtime fans. 
Hitchcock wandered onto the stage with tea in hand and 
arranged the equipment. Playing both acoustic and elec
tric guitar, he performed songs from his prolific catalog in
cluding two cover songs, Are You Experienced? and San 
Francisco. Hitchcock did not focus on his more popular 
songs or new pieces. The songs he did perform flowed to
gether well but seemed to have been selected on a whim. 
This was not surprising to those familiar with his perfor
mances.
Between songs, he entertained the captivated (though not 
necessarily comprehending) audience with his fantasti
cal, stream-of-consciousness speeches. Among the topics 
discussed: the 1960s, the elastic decade (we live in the 
year 1960^44, apparently), Peter Sellers, Victorian squid, 
and the sacred triangle (sex, food, death). He abandoned 
his cryptic musings for the last song of his set, which he 
called a public service announcement rather than a song. 
He informed the audience that Dubya sucks/We all know 
about the evil of ducks/And of the innocence of mice/And 
that Donald Rumsfeld is the Antichrist. Afterwards, Hitch
cock invited the audience to join him in the lobby where he 
would play encores on piano, although the audience ulti
mately convinced him to pick up his guitar once more for 
a second set of encores. His enthusiasm was apparent for 
the duration of the two-hour-plus performance, and the 
audience was equally energized and joined him in singing 
Sleeping with your Devil Mask in the lobby.
Amid all the streamlined music of today and the intense 
desire of many bands to achieve fame, Hitchcock gives a 
refreshing and much-needed change of pace. His mind 
and music remain unaffected compared to other artists 
influenced by the profit-driven music industry and the 
cliche of contemporary rock music. He speaks his own 
language in life and in music, and the result is incredibly 
honest pieces that are fascinatingly unique. The listener 
may not know what a particular song means, but that is 
not the point when hearing Hitchcocks art. As Hitchcock 
explained to some audience members while signing au
tographs after the show, he does not write songs with 
a specific goal. His art focuses on the subconscious, so 
its interpretation is often ambiguous and open-ended. 
Known to avoid the spotlight, Hitchcock is easy to over
look, but to those fortunate enough to discover his music, 
he is an essential part of rock music, historically and in 
the present. With roughly ten albums currently in print 
(the others are harder to find), the fans who missed the 
concert can still partake in the experience that is com
plexly Robyn Hitchcock.

Big Als Metal Shop
Two notable tours showcase hot 
metal bands
Last years inaugural MTV2 Headbangers Ball Tour 
gave us a triad of American metals best: Shadows 
Fall, Killswitch Engage, and lamb of god all have gone 
on to bigger stages since, but they all owe some of 
their success to the exposure gained on a tour of such 
notoriety.
This falls edition, however, has a decidedly interna
tional flavor to it. There are potential breakthrough 
American acts in Bleeding Through and Himsa, but 
the headliners wont be shown up. First off is Arch 
Enemy. Led by blazing riffs from the brothers Arnott 
(Chris and Michael, ex-Carcass) and the caustic vox 
of one Ms. Angela Gossow, this Swedish/German jug
gernaut just killed last year on the Jgermeister tour 
(with Slayer, natch). Angela, to put it gently, is a bad 
ass on stage, taking no crap from any Neanderthals 
up front. Having one of the premier guitar wizards of 
the 90s in Mike Arnott backing her aint too shabby 
either.
And of course there is Cradle of Filth. Being the nice 
English gentlemen they are, COF will be bringing 
their T-shirt collection stateside to share with all. 
Rude, blasphemous tees for all! For all you neo-goth/ 
black metal-ers, this is your night. Come on out with 
your vile style, and show off your fashion (err... all
black) sense. If you havent noticed by now, Filth is a 
phenomenon, but not my kind of thing. Still, they put 
on a show, or so Ive been told. Check them out at The 
World tonight in the Strip District.
Another tour that is definitely my thing is the E-Town 
Concrete/Diecast/Devilinside package this Wednes
day, also at the Strip. E-town will crush, but if I may, 
let me divert your attention to the pairing of Diecast 
and Devilinside. In 2001, Diecast released a pivotal 
album in the formation of my present musical taste. 
Day of Reckoning combined the precision and break
neck speed of Slayer with the sludgy violence of 
Down. Metalcore was influenced in no small part by 
their clean vocals interlaced with atmospheric soundscapes. And following in that tradition is Devilinside. 
With intros adding foreplay somehow missing in 
Metalcore, Devilinside set their own path in this sub
genre. Check out new albums by both: Tearing Down 
Your Blue Skies for Diecast, and Volume One for Devil
inside.
And while youre at it, pick up the Headbangers Ball 
Volume 2 tour companion disc.

Magical Neverland Flies High
Finding Neverland showcases Depps skills
Johnny Depp puts forward another great performance 
in Finding Neverland, a movie that will have the women 
in the audience crying and the men groaning. The movie 
combines outstanding acting with imaginative scenes, 
but loses momentum in a predictably sappy ending. It 
makes you wonder where the true story ends and Hol
lywood writing takes over. The film is an insight to play
wright J.M. Barries life, spanning the period from direct
ly before he wrote his famous Peter Pan play to shortly 
afterward.
After the failure of his latest play, Barrie (played by Depp) 
needs inspiration. Unable to realize ideas in the company 
of his unloving wife (played coldly but sympathetically by 
Radha Mitchell) he finds his muse in the widow Sylvia 
Llewelyn Davies (Kate Winslet) and her four sons. After 
a chance encounter in the park, Barrie soon finds himself 
spending most of his free time with the family, playing 
with them in wild imaginary situations with characters 
ranging from cowboys and Indians to pirate marauders. 
This development occurs much to the dismay of his wife 
and Sylvias mother, who is appalled by Barries childish 
behavior and feels that he is hindering their development 
into adults.
Barrie is especially enamored with Sylvias son Peter. He is 
the youngest child and the one left most emotionally frag
ile after the death of his father. His initial lack of imagina
tion grows through his relationship with the playwright, 
and soon the two share a close bond as Barrie helps the 
young Peter learn to write. All is not well in the Davies 
household, however, and Sylvias bouts of hacking cough 
allude to a tragic ending. Inspired by all these events, Bar
rie writes his most famous work. Initially, his work is met 
with doubt by actors and producers, but soon it becomes 
apparent that this play will alter the face of modern the
ater. Opening to a packed house, Barrie realizes that the 
most important part of his audience is missing: Sylvia has 
been confined to her bed because of her illness. The rest 
of the film is sappy and predictable from this point on. 
Barrie ends up coming to peace with his now estranged 
wife and with Sylvias mother, and he lives presumably 
happily ever after as father to the four boys.
The first hour and a half of this movie is well written and 
enjoyable to watch. Depp and Winslet play their roles 
gracefully and immerse the audience in 1903-era Lon
don. Dustin Hoffman brings humor to the film with his 
portrayal of producer Charles Frohman. The scenes de
picting Barries imagination and creativity while playing 
with the children are beautifully rendered. The film even 
does a good job of addressing the speculation of a mar
ried man spending all of his free time with four young 
boys, using a conversation between Barrie and Arthur 
Conan Doyle to respectfully bring the situation to light.Johnny Depp finds his inner child playing pirates with kids in the park.
BEVV204? 1 50,MS2MH eCCI?
However, the film loses much of this momentum by fall
ing into predictable situations that seem designed to tug 
at the heartstrings of audience members. The role of Peter 
is overacted, making the boy more annoying than sympa
thetic. The end of the movie is so sappy that it taints the 
truth of the plot it concludes. The real J.M. Barrie never 
made amends with Sylvia Davies mother, and it is widely 
rumored that he in fact forged her will in order to gain 
custody of her children. Furthermore, the movie makes 
it out to seem like everyone lived happily ever after, but 
the lives of the children were seriously damaged by their 
roles in Barries play. Two died tragically in the years to 
come and Peter, unable to deal with his relationship to 
Peter Pan, threw himself under a train at the age of sixty.
On the whole, Finding Neverland is a good movie. It 
seems like the perfect date film, although the guys in the 
audience might find themselves a bit annoyed by the end. 
If nothing else, its worth the price of admission just to 
watch Johnny Depp add another great performance to 
his resume. Just try to keep in mind that its not all based 
on a true story.

A Polar Success
Zemeckis has made a genuine childrens film
Director Robert Zemeckis has always been ahead 
of his time. He was the mastermind behind Who 
Framed Roger Rabbit (1988) and the Back to the Future 
movies (1985-1990). Both pushed the limits of the 
movie-making technology of the time. He has also 
been successful with character movies, including the 
Academy-Award-winning Forrest Gump (1994), Cast 
Away (2000) and the creepy What Lies Beneath (2000). 
The Polar Express, based on the childrens book of 
the same name by Chris Van Allsburg, is a fusion of 
cutting-edge technology and character focus.
The characters in The Polar Express are largely 
unnamed. The main character is simply the Hero 
Boy. Tom Hanks characters include the Father, the 
Train Conductor, the Scrooge, the Hobo, and Santa 
Claus. This technique works because the story is not 
about just one childs journey; this story could apply to 
any kid who has ever felt too old to believe in the spirit 
of Christmas.
The Polar Express is the train that arrives at each 
childs house on Christmas Eve. These are kids who 
have reached a very special time in their lives; they 
have begun to question the existence of Santa Claus. 
There are two other main children, besides the Hero 
Boy, whose characters are well-developed. The first is 
the Hero Girl, a born leader and example for the other 
children. The second, and most sympathetic character, 
is the poor boy called Billy. When he says with a sul
len face, Christmas just doesnt work out for me, it is 
impossible not to melt.
Minor characters include the Know-it-all, whose irri
tating voice takes some getting used to, and a mysteri
ous Hobo character who tells the Hero Boy, Seeing is 
believing. While his lines are good, his appearance 
may be a little frightening for young kids. Additionally, 
there are some scary scenes on the train when the kids 
stumble into a car of abused and retired toys. These, 
however, are short and only add to the atmosphere of 
the train ride. The best scenes come when the three 
main kids are exploring the train and getting into an 
unimaginable amount of trouble. Tom Hanks conduc
tor character is solid, but is often not around for the 
strongest sequences.
In conjunction with the excellent characterization of 
the three young children, the animation is breathtak
ing. The motion-capture technology used will sure
ly become the industry standard. Instead of regular 
computer animation (used in movies like 1995s Toy 
Story), Zemeckis has employed a technology usually 
reserved for video games. His actors actually played 
out the entire script wearing skin-tight video capture
suits. These suits recorded every minute motion of 
every muscle in the actors bodies. This translates into 
flawless motion simulation in the film; the characters 
moved like real people.
The eyes and hair are especially notable. The eyes 
glimmer and glaze over at all the right times and never 
conflict with the emotions that the characters are 
expressing. The hair, however, is the most realistic. It 
moves and waves and really feels alive. Each character 
has a unique style of hair, including the bald, shiny
headed Conductor.
Where The Polar Express really succeeds is in targeting 
its audience. Other animated films, like Shrek, have 
been confused about what audience to relate to in 
their storylines. This has often led to a mixed bag of 
childrens themes coated over with adolescent jokes 
and tongue-in-cheek plays to parents. The Polar Express 
does not get bogged down in the same age ambiguity. 
This is a film for kids that everyone can enjoy.
The moral of the story picks up when the train arrives 
at the North Pole. It is a beautifully pure message. Its 
only aim is to keep kids from losing their innocence for 
as long as possible. The film tells them that if they want 
to experience the magic of Christmas, or anything else 
for that matter, they have to believe. This belief alone 
will keep the spirit alive in their hearts. The Hero Boy

Zemeckis has made a film with value and meaning.

Morte a Venezia
[Wednesday, 10 and 12)
Classical music, homosexual pedophilia, and plague. Sounds like a Troy se
quel, but its actually a movie based on Thomas Manns novel Death in Venice 
where a fancy-pants composer named Gustave Aschenbach takes a vacation. 
Instead of cannolis and hot Italian women, the good composer falls in love 
with a little boy. Apparently he finds the child hot and representative of all 
the creative perfection he has recently lost in his work before he and the boy 
die horribly of the plague.
My Architect: A Sons Journey
(Thursday, 7:30, 10, and 12:30)
Wow. World-famous architect Louis Khan get jiggy outside his marriage and 
has two kids. Instead of being the good father, he dies in a bathroom when 
his son Nathaniel is 11 years old. Nat then tours the world seeing his dads 
buildings and meeting his friends and generally feeling all emo.
The Terminal
(Friday, 8,10, and 12]
There arent any Wilsons or boxes of chocolate in this movie. Tom Hanks plays 
an immigrant from Eastern Europe whose country is destroyed the instant he 
arrives in the U.S., voiding his passport and stranding him in JFK Airport. Oh 
yeah, he falls in love with that hot Catherine Zeta-Jones along th'- way, and 
makes friends with all of the people who work at the airport.
Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story
(Saturday, 8,10, and 12]
Go Team Slapstick! Lots of funny people in this one, and its about dodgeball. 
Holy rubber balls of justice, Batman! Vince Vaughn, Rip Tom, and Ben Stiller 
all show up to entertain us with a disposable storyline that revolves around 
dodgeball and saving a dinky little gym where losers go to work out. Stillers 
character owns a big gym chain thats trying to buy out Vaughns characters 
gym. Dodgeball, dodgeball, dodgeball.
Mifunes sidste sang
(Sunday, 8,10, and 12J
So, apparently, this movie has something to do with this guy Kresten who 
moves to Copenhagen to work on his career and then comes back to the fam
ily farm when his dad dies, taking on the responsibility of raising his mentally 
challenged brother Rud. The catch is that hes hidden his family from her and 
ditches him as a result. To better bear the burden, he hires a prostitute named 
Liva to help out. She works to support her brother Bjarke at school, but he 
drops out and comes to live with them. So, basically Kresten, Rud, Bjarke, 
and Liva all live in the same place in this disastrously dysfunctional version 
of The Brady Bunch.

College Music Awards brings younger audience
Fans pack Wiegand Gym to hear Taking Back Sunday
I pride myself on being able to have a decent time at 
pretty much any concert, and especially at free concerts. 
But on Friday night, during the 2004 College Music 
Awards tour of Taking Back Sunday, I found myself com
pletely at a loss.
It began as soon as I walked into the darkened Wiegand 
Gym and realized I was the oldest person I knew. Now, I 
enjoy looking at a parade of sullen, attractive emo boys 
as much as the next girl, but all the fun is taken out of it 
when they dont even come close to an appropriate age. 
The concert sold out a total of some 2000 tickets; a quick 
look at the crowd indicated that the majority were still 
in high school. Some audience members were so young 
that their mothers came into the gym to drop them off, 
asking the concert staff if their children would be okay 
in there.
I was hoping things would improve when the bands 
began. In addition to Taking Back Sunday, the bill 
featured emo bands The Varsity, Funeral for a Friend, 
and Atreyu. However, when The Varsity took the stage, 
things began to look less promising, and the enjoy
ment factor increased only marginally with the appear
ances of Funeral for a Friend and Atreyu. The music, 
sometimes referred to as screamo, straddled the line 
between the more acoustic style of emo and the thrash
ing of punk, punctuated with plenty of throaty scream
ing. Unfortunately, it never quite reached the emotional 
or energetic level required of either genre. The breaking 
point came when the lead singer of Atreyu, after finish
ing a song whose chorus consisted mostly of expletives, 
commanded the crowd, If youve got a lighter, or a cell 
phone, raise it in the air!
Therein lies the premise of Taking Back Sunday and simi
lar bands. Their music is safer than punk, tamer, based 
less on anger and more on angst. They view punk as a 
thing of the past. Emos audience doesnt have all that 
much to be righteous or disillusioned about, so instead 
of setting things on fire, they turn inward, churning out 
songs about how depressed and isolated they are, lost in 
the land of adolescence and its accessories. This template 
leaves little room for imagination or originality, which 
was painfully evident at Friday nights concert.
All four bands followed a cookie-cutter code of unifor
mity. The lead singers all had hair falling into their faces 
and dark slouchy clothing, and they all slithered and 
contorted across the stage in a performing style generally 
credited to Scott Wyland of the late Stone Temple Pilots. 
All the band members performed the same guitar stunts 
and demanded the same responses from the crowd. Even 
the T-shirts for sale at the merch tables in the corner of 
the gym looked similar. One song was hard to tell from
another; to an untrained ear, it sounded like an end
less stream of mumbled lyrics, screaming, and beating 
instrumentals. Ironically, it was Funeral for a Friend and 
Atreyu, not the headlining band, that captured my inter
est the most. Their music seemed to have a more heavy 
metal style than the others, and they spread more energy 
on and off the stage.
There were, of course, some positive aspects. The produc
tion was tight and timely, with minimal waiting between 
sets and solid lighting. The only production detail that 
struck me as odd was the music chosen between sets, 
which included such songs as Britney Spears Toxic 
and Kris Kross. The crowd was well-behaved, with only a 
small handful of incidents, and they all appeared to have 
a good time. Furthermore, the audience got plenty of 
bang for their bucktickets were free for CMU students 
and ten dollars for non-students, and in return there 
were four hours of constant music.
As far as musical tastes go, its possible I would appreci
ate Taking Back Sunday and its fellow bands more if I 
were properly initiated into emo. But if youre looking for 
alternative rock thats a little more stimulating, take it 
from a nineteen-year-old geezer like me and go listen to 
some Smashing Pumpkins.

Traveling Film South Asia comes to
Festival brings groundbreaking grassroots films to Oakland
Last Tuesday, Carnegie Mellon began Traveling Film 
South Asia, a festival featuring fifteen documentaries 
from Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan. The festi
val is jointly funded by the University of Pittsburgh and 
Carnegie Mellon. The fifteen films brought by the festival 
address themes of cultural strife and traditions, environ
mental activism and personal identities. The films have a 
range of topics to pique viewer interest, but there is also a 
rich history behind the festival itself.
Jayeeta Sharma, a faculty member in Carnegie Mellons 
history department and one of the organizers of the 
festival, spoke a bit about how the festival began and 
how it came to the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie 
Mellon campuses. Film South Asia 03, was shown in Kat
mandu in September of 2003, according to the Himal As
sociation, a not-for-profit institution dedicated to spread
ing knowledge and information in Nepal and South 
Asia that organizes Film South Asia every year. Sharma 
explained that those working with Film South Asia saw 
two trends, that lots of social movements were happen
ing and the filmmaking process had become more eco
nomical. So, Sharma said, For the first time, there were 
lots of grassroots people making films. In response, the 
Film South Asia began, and in 2003, after four years in 
the making, decided that they wished to broaden their 
horizons beyond Nepal and Bangladesh, where the films 
were being screened. Traveling Fim South Asia was born 
and began to screen the films in many countries. The 
pamphlet about Traveling Film South Asia describes that 
the level of entries for the 2003 festival was far beyond 
any previous festivals, but of course, the films had to be 
narrowed down.
Of the original 43 documentaries that were chosen from 
the submissions, just 15 are being screened in Pittsburgh. 
Sharma said that since the films are grouped themati
cally, People can come for the films that interest them. 
The film screenings are split between the ones during 
the week, which are shown at Carnegie Mellon, and the 
weekend ones,'which are shown at the University of Pitts
burgh.
The first films were shown on Tuesday, and ran under 
the theme of development. Sharma described the main 
points in each film, noting that the first film, Development 
Flows from the Barrel of the Gun, was created by activists 
who wished to emphasize how local people often have no 
say in the developments in their areas. The film mainly 
concentrates on hardships faced in India that are caused 
by development of dams. The second film, also screened 
Tuesday, told the story of people who faced a water crisis. 
This film speaks about the use of water for recreational 
and other more frivolous purposes while there are 
many who must go to extreme measures to obtain fairly 
clean water.

A scene from Resilient Rhythms, one of the 43 films featured.
Sharma said that while the Indian film industry is quite 
large and well-known, These are really the first wave of 
documentaries.
Wednesdays film, The Eighteenth Elephant, was themed 
conservation and was about the death of a single 
abused elephant. This documentary captures a period of 
time when efforts were being made to move and adjust a 
badly injured elephant. The creature, a Kerala elephant, 
was hit by a truck and its back side was visibly bruised 
and deformed by the injury. Even more brutal, however, 
was the fracture of one of its front legs, which caused 
it to fall onto its knees. The film creates monologues 
from the perspective of the miserable elephant as the 
people around it force its leg into a strange basket-like 
splint. Later the elephant is placed in an unusual wooden 
structure, presumably to keep it still and to keep its legs 
positioned a certain way. It is unclear to the elephant 
whether the villagers are trying to hurt it. The documen
tary is quite challenging to watch and contains obvious 
messages about the harmfulness of humans to all life and 
aspects of the Earth.
Pitt and CMU
Similar to the films that addressed issues with the water 
in India, Saturdays film, Sand and Water, addressed the 
flooding of the River Jamuna in Bangladesh. The docu
mentary traces the lives of people on the chars, the ar
eas of the river that peek up above the surface even in the 
worst part of the flood season. The filmmaker went up 
the river with the help of a guide who was a dweller him
self. Along the way viewers see the lives of people in the 
worst floods. Many live on islands of sediment that have 
collected in the river; some still live in their homes but 
are just barely above the waters edge. This particular film 
used many personal interviews to gain a representative 
view of people living at the mercy of Jamuna. During the 
rainy season the boat was taken to the large bridge that 
links North and South Bangladesh across the river. This 
bridge has disturbed the water flow and it seems many 
residents of the area question whether the flooding has 
been worse due to this disturbance. The film points out 
that the people who live on the chars do not seem to have 
the agency to speak to anyone about the bridges possible 
implications on their land. The filmmaker returns again 
during the dry season to witness the greatly altered land
scape. In his time away, the water has receded down to a 
very contained size and the people live on dry land again. 
The message of the film comes full circle, however: when 
the filmmaker leaves, the people are already preparing 
for the wet season to come and devastate their home for 
four months of the year.
The Traveling Film South Asia festival runs November 
9-21. Curious readers should pick up a pamphlet to get a 
brief idea of the films content as well as the category of 
that particular day. Viewers will get a chance to experi
ence foreign documentaries with a variety of messages 
and a unique perspective from those on the other side of 
the world.

Halo 2 rises to become King of the Hill
How the Halo franchise is taking the world by storm
2. Every single expectation we had for this game, from 
the number of pre-orders to the number of concurrent 
live users to the amount of production time we needed, 
has been wildly underestimated, said Perez. The com
pany thought the Halo series would be big  but never 
this big.
Halo and Halo 2 chronicle a far-reaching space epic set 
500 years in the future. The Covenant, a conglomeration 
of alien races bound by a religious pact, are at war with 
humanity, and the humans are rapidly losing ground. The 
games main character, a cybernetically enhanced soldier 
simply known by his rank  Master Chief  has to help 
turn the tide of the conflict and save mankind. Along the 
way, the ship he is on is attacked while in orbit around 
a giant, planet-sized ring called Halo, complete with ar
tificial environments and some rather nasty indigenous 
life. The sequel finds Master Chief back on Earth defend
ing our home planet from the first stages of Covenant as
sault. In between these plot elements there are plot twists 
stacked upon political intrigue stacked upon religious 
doctrine to create a remarkably deep story that sets the 
series in a league of its own. According to Matt Leighty, 
a senior in mechanical engineering, The story got you 
involved. It wasnt your typical kill this dude, and you 
know, the war is over. You felt like you advanced through 
the game.
Leighty was one^f more than 150 people who stood out
side the Electronics Boutique in Squirrel Hill in the hours 
before the store opened for a special Midnight Madness 
event at midnight on November 9 for the release of Halo 
2. These fans and their friends braved freezing-cold tem
peratures and late-night drivers honking their horns and 
shouting out their windows to be some of the first people 
on the eastern seaboard to own Halo 2. Many proud game 
owners left the store with beaming grins, but for others in 
line, it was a bittersweet moment. I plan to sleep alone 
for many nights following tonight, lamented sophomore 
professional writing, creative writing and social and cul
tural history major Janet Jay, as her boyfriend waited in 
line to purchase his pre-ordered copy. She understood the 
draw of the game, though, and did not hesitate to admit 
that even she was sort of looking forward to it.
Im a firm believer that running around and destroying 
your enemies is as fundamental to the human condition 
as eating or sleeping; Im happy people are satiating that 
part of their id with something interactive rather than 
watching professional sports, said Perez. Where Halo 
and Halo 2 really excel on that level is in multiplayer 
combat. The built-in networking capability of the Xbox 
allowed Halo players to link up their systems to a stan
dard Ethernet network and set up games in which up to
Its not every day that you get to help take over the world, 
but on November 9, nearly two and a half million people 
took Bungie Studios tantalizingly close to that goal.
Bungie Studios was founded in 1991 in Chicago to make 
games for Macintosh computers. This company has al
ways claimed that they wanted to take over the world. 
Meeting modest success in the 90s, the company wowed 
the computer press in 1999 with a presentation of their 
newest project, a game called Halo. A year later Microsoft 
bought the small development firm and decided to make 
Halo a flagship title for their upcoming game console, the 
Xbox. Halo launched alongside the Xbox on November 
15, 2001.
Three years and five million copies later, Halo is still in 
the 10 top-selling Xbox games month after month. The 
juggernaut, however, is just getting started. Halo 2, Mi
crosofts feverishly anticipated sequel, was released last 
week. Selling nearly 2.4 million copies in the first twentyfour hours of retail availability, Halo 2 made $125 million 
on opening dayearning $10 million more than the box 
office record-holding movie, Spider-Man. World domina
tion, it seems, is but a few steps away for Bungie Studios.
Adrian Perez is a programmer at Bungie Studios and a 
2001 Carnegie Mellon graduate in computer science. He 
programmed the damage system and parts of the user in
terface, as well as portions of the graphics code in Halo

sixteen players worked together  or against each other
 in team games like Capture the Flag and standard killeverything-that-moves deathmatches. Scott Lowry, a se
nior business major in line at Electronics Boutique, made 
the bold claim, Its one of the best multiplayer games of 
all time.
Themultiplayercapabilityiswhatbringspeoplebackagain 
and again. Justin Weisz, a graduate student in computer 
science and president of Carnegie Mellons Online Gam
ing Society (OGS), explains, Bungie is just really good at 
creating a community and keeping its members happy. 
In Halo 2 that community is being brought online for the 
first time on Xbox. Taking advantage of the Xbox Live 
subscription service, Bungies website (www.bungie.net) 
offers complete statistic tracking for any player in any 
match, including a game viewer which will show a map 
with player locations marked by small icons. Their stats 
system is insane, said Weisz, and it is just one of those 
touches that makes Halo such a fan-focused game.
Alexander Meseguer/Layout Manager
CMU's OGS brings people together to play Halo and Halo 2.
Even when the first Halo game came out, multiplayer was 
a big deal. Dedicated gamers would haul their Xboxes 
and TVs to LAN parties, where they would link up with 
other players and play games all night long  and some
times all day. The OGS held one of these parties on the 
evening of November 8 to celebrate Halo 2s launch. The 
group set up Xboxes and projectors in Baker Hall A51 
and played Halo until shordy after midnight, when they 
switched over to Halo 2.
Bungie has infused the Halo games with a kind of addic
tive fun that keeps players coming back, in both the mul
tiplayer and story modes. The core of the game is a really 
fun 30 seconds where you encounter some bad guys, take 
out a couple with a grenade, head-shot a couple more, 
flank the rest and finish them off. We just have that 30 
seconds happen over and over, and we give the player a 
lot of options to permute the battle in different ways, 
said Perez, adding that theres actually some style to the 
way you choose to push through.
That style has garnered Halo, and especially Halo 2, a lot 
of attention from the entertainment industry. MTV ran a 
half-hour special about the making of the game the week 
before Halo 2 was released. The games official soundtrack 
CD is being sold in major retail stores, and features ex
clusive, HaZo-inspired songs by popular bands Breaking 
Benjamin and Hoobastank, as well as a 28-minute piece 
by Incubus divided into three instrumental movements 
and one vocal movement. These bands are all full of self
described Halo nuts, and would play system link games 
against other bands between tour buses before concerts. 
The Daily Show with Jon Stewart featured a segment on 
their Election Day coverage with one of the correspon
dents, Rob Corddry, playing Halo onscreen instead of re
porting election returns.
Part of Halo 2s instant success is undoubtedly thanks to 
the marketing money Microsoft put behind it. Trailers 
for the game showed in theaters before many of the sum
mers biggest movies. There were Halo 2 Slurpee cups at 
7-11. Every game and electronics store was covered with 
Halo 2 stickers and posters from front to back. Photo were 
staged all over the world with men in full-size Master 
Chief armor, including several shots with Ms. Universe. 
In one of the largest-scale viral marketing campaigns ever 
conceived, Microsoft hired a company to create www. 
ilovebees.com, home to a massive puzzle which had hun
dreds of fans running all over the country answering payphones and unlocking pieces to an audio story leading up 
to the events of Halo 2.
All this success is leading up to the fact that video games 
arent just for kids anymore. The average age for people
Courtesy of RRRN1m3f.wN3w8
Master Chief prepares to defend Earth in Halo 2.
waiting in line at Electronics Boutique for Halo 2s mid
night release was at least 22, probably higher. Our en
tire generation was playing games when we were kids; 
we were the primary demographic, explained Perez. As 
that demographic has grown up, so has the gaming in
dustry. David Murray, a senior in Computer Science and 
vice president of OGS, foresees the trend continuing in 
the future as the gaming generation continues to age. By 
the time that were senior citizens, the entire world popu
lation will have experienced gaming in their lives, or will 
have seen people gaming.
The latest generation of game console systems like the 
Xbox has started that process already, allowing more 
people to play more-advanced games. Gaming is now 
cool, thanks to the wider adoption of gaming systems and 
flagship titles like Halo and Halo 2 that appeal to more 
than just gamers. A significant population of students at 
Carnegie Mellon have probably experienced Halo at some 
point in the past three years, and most people would be 
hard pressed to find another game that matches that sort 
of saturation. Bungie Studios has done something truly 
impressive  it has created not only a game but a cultural 
phenomenon.

Best Human balances humor with irrelevance
Unique competition crowns its winner
On Friday, just one hour before the annual Mr. Fraternity 
competition, students walked into a modestly decorated 
room for the Best Human competition. At the door, au
dience members were given a plastic star bead and told 
to vote for their favorite dish, then were directed to the 
culinary creations in the back of the room.
The Best Human competition is the first of its kind 
offered on campus, a beauty pageant that broke all the 
rules. Seven contestants were selected among those who 
applied: Julia Carroll, Grant Van Nostrand, Francesca Re
ale, Ed Ryan, Rudi Feiler, Anna Vogelzang, Michael Yin, 
and one non-human competitor  a guy in a chicken suit 
who went by the name GoVeg.com
According to their website, the event was definitely not 
funded by your activities fee, as it was rejected for fund
ing by Student Senate, despite being co-sponsored by The 
Co-op, Scotch n Soda, ALLIES, and the Womens Center, - 
among other organizations. The judges panel included 
housefellow Jennifer Bird, Tartan Executive Officer Mark 
Egerman, and Student Body President Erik MichaelsOber, who was described as last years champion, despite 
the fact that this was the first year for the event.
12-------------------------------------------------------
The competition consisted of four events: a talent com
petition, a balloon throwing competition, a food tasting 
competition, and a question round, with questions seem
ingly made up on the spot by emcee Josh Hailpern. The 
first round included acts such as singing quickly, singing 
loudly, wasting 20 seconds of time, and a well-executed 
rap number from GoVeg.com. In the balloon-throwing 
competition, contestants lined up and threw balloons as 
far and as creatively as they could.
The third event, food tasting, was determined by the 
audiences votes with their plastic beads. Much like Iron 
Chef, the competitors were instructed to prepare some 
sort of dish using a surprise ingredient  cherry KoolAid powder. The dishes included challah bread with kool 
aid powdered apples, baked apples with kool aid powder 
centers, and graham crackers with peanut butter and 
kool aid powder. The final round was the question round. 
Questions such as If you were a dinosaur in Mesopota
mia, how would you solve their economic crisis?, Spell 
onomatopoeia, and What color is the sky and how does 
it make you feel about puppies? were asked by Hailpern, 
who kept the audience laughing throughout the competi
tion.

The winner of Best Human was Michael Yin, with 
runners-up Feiler and Reale. All participants received a 
trail mix granola bar, while the second-place finisher 
received 50 vitamins, and the winner received a box of 
granola bars and 100 vitamins.
An enjoyable parody of pageants, Best Human provided 
everyone a good time with lots of humor. Although the 
competition went so smoothly that it seemed scripted, 
Van Nostrand stated, We mostly made things up as we 
went along. The only thing scripted was the opening 
dance. It only took 40 minutes to learn the whole breakdancing bit  they told us to spin around on the floor.

HOROSCOPES.
BY DINAH WINNICK
ARIES (March 21 - April 19): After years of appreciating the dairy industry from afar, 
you will finally secure employment at a lovely Vermont farm, only to become disen
chanted by the decidedly unfancy process of making fancy" cheeses.
TAURUS (April 20- May 20): Finally fed up with having vegetables go bad in your fridge 
after youve gone to the trouble to buy them fresh at the grocery at least once every four 
weeks, you will decide that vitamin supplements are the way to go. You will quickly ac
quire a healthy glow, clear skin, and shiny hair, and only smell a little bit funky.
GEMINI (May 21 - June 21): Your car may be impounded today, but just think how good 
not having the money to bail it out or pay for your overdue parking tickets will be for the 
environment and for your cardiovascular health in the long run.
CANCER (June 22 - July 22): After class Thursday you will lie down in Frick Park to 
appreciate the stunning sky and natural landscape peeking through the cracks of the 
urban facade, only to be made seasick by black clouds speeding across the skyline and 
waves crashing in the six feet of water that those clouds suddenly dropped on the greater 
Pittsburgh area.
LEO (July 23 - August 22): An exciting reunion with a lost friend awaits. Miss
ing you terribly since you left home for college, your lonely Barbie and Ken dolls 
will trek across the country to be reunited with their loving owner. Their loving, 
soon-to-be-socially-ostracized owner.
VIRGO (August 23 - September 22): You will soon break your personal best record for 
the number of water bottles stashed in your clothing without the aid of a backpack or 
other carrying device, after a catered campus lecture that you will actually not even at
tend.
LIBRA (September 23 - October 23): Tomorrows brisk but sunny weather will allow 
you to gaze at the stunning autumn trees in the spectacular starkness of their natural 
skeletal state without the interference of pesky leaves or snow.
SCORPIO (October 24 - November 21): There is a nearly 24.14 percent chance that 
your birthday will occur some time this week. Congratulations! Youre a winner. Eat 
some ice cream!
SAGITTARIUS (November 22 - December 21): The committee and I regretfully inform 
you that due to the sheer number of very qualified applicants who have been considered 
for this position, there is absolutely no chance that today is your birthday, or that it will 
occur some time this week. Im sorry. You are not this weeks winner, but try again next 
week. Anyhow, you can still eat some ice cream.
CAPRICORN (December 22 - January 19): Dress as Your Favorite Genius Day will 
finally give you the perfect opportunity to let your gigantic, Einstein hair wild. You may 
not be just like him, but for once big hair may be all you need to achieve that public 
recognition and to sense deep personal connection with your hero.
AQUARIUS (January 20 - February 18): Getting a girl to hang out in your Hamerschlag 
room for your DDR fest and to eat some Top Ramen, which your parents bought in bulk 
when they moved you in, does not count as a first date. It will, however, likely eliminate 
the probability of a second.
PISCES (February 19 - March 20): The genetically modified tomato on your dinner table 
tomorrow night, suddenly overcome with anger due to its subjugated food chain position 
and feeling used and manipulated, will jump up and plaster itself all over your face in 
self-sacrificing attack. You will be grossed out, and feel more confused than convinced 
of its plight.

Weekly inspiration from the ominously brooding pond
Maria! Fernando cried out. He rushed over to her, knocking
over his chair. Maria was gasping and motioning desperately to . O
her throat. A wave of terror rushed over Fernando. He couldnt f ^
believe that he had unwittingly poisoned the only duck he really j
cared for. He knew with every feather on his body that he had
to save Maria. Frantically, he tried to think of an antidote to the
poison. He would do anything to relieve the pain Maria was in. Rogelio had also jumped
from his seat. Stand back, Fernando! he exclaimed. And while Fernando looked all
over for something to give Maria as an antidote, Rogelio pulled Maria from her chair
and started performing the Heimlich maneuver on her. After several thrusts, a salivacovered bread crumb dislodged itself from her throat and she coughed it across the table.
The shock was too much for Maria, and her body went limp in Rogelio s arms.

Krazy Kat: Reissuing A Classic
BEVV204? 1 50,MS2MH eCCI?
George Herrimans comic strip Krazy Kat was a masterpiece. It 
ran for nearly 30 years, until its creators death in 1944, at which 
point it fell into relative obscurity. Of course, Krazy was obscure 
even in its own time. The artistry and genius of its repetitive but 
somehow always unique plot was too distant for the greater public 
to appreciate. True, there were Krazy film cartoons, but for these 
all the characters were dumbed down and the artistic genius was 
forgotten. These cartoons were simply a way for the syndicate of 
making the characters accessible to mass audiences.
The plot of Krazy Kat comics never changed: a mouse named 
Ignatz did nothing but hurl bricks at a cat (Krazy), who takes 
the assault as a display of love. The local police officer (Offissa 
Pupp) then arrests Ignatz, because he is in fact in love with Krazy. 
Herriman, in essence, told this same tale with each comic, but 
always in a slightly different way, and with a different joke to 
close it. There was a cast of recurring guest characters, such as 
Bum Bill Bee, Walter Cephus Austridge (an ostrich), and Kolin 
Kelly, a dog brickmaker whose freshly-baked bricks were often 
stolen by Ignatz. All of these characters lived in Coconino County, 
a place with an Arizona landscape, complete with towering red 
plateaus and strangely shaped cacti. No two panels were exactly 
the same; Herriman purposely changed the landscape from panel 
to panel even if the characters remained stationary. To further the 
surrealistic feeling, the time of day altered from panel to panel as 
well: daytime became nighttime instantly, and reverted back to 
daytime just as quickly.
Krazy has inspired many of today's most notable cartoonists. Bill 
Watterson, creator of Calvin and Hobbes, said Krazy Kat was one 
of his three biggest comic influences (the others being Peanuts and 
Pogo). Patrick McDonnell of Mutts is such a big fan that he literally 
wrote the book on Herriman, with 1986s Krazy Kat: The Comic 
Art of George Herriman. When comparing McDonnells Mutts and 
Krazy Kat, its quite easy to see the influence. He even borrowed 
the name of Mutts cat character from another Herriman creation, 
Baron Mooch.
Fantagraphics Books, which publishes the work of some of todays 
leading cartoonists along with well-edited collections of classic 
comics (they are best known for the recent Complete Peanuts 
collections), has begun publishing Krazy Kat books in chronological 
order. Edited by Bill Blackbeard, these collections follow up the 
series The Komplete KatKomics (covering 1916-1924), which was 
printed by a different publisher and discontinued a few years ago. 
The first collection, 1925-26, was released two years ago, and 
three additional collections have consistently followed, with more 
on the way. The design of the Fantagraphics collections is by Chris 
Ware, himself a graphic novelist and creator of Jimmy Corrigan 
and Quimby the Mouse. Wares covers are extremely well designed 
and very indicative of Krazys spirit. It is ^bit odd to see the style of 
the old cartoon in a computer-designed cover, but the designs are 
quite beautiful and enhance the work inside.
The reprinted comics are as complete as they can be; they have 
been taken directly from the original newspapers where they were 
printed. Blackbeard, admittedly, omitted some comics because they 
could not be found in archives, but considering the age and rarity 
of these comics to begin with, completeness is hardly a problem. 
My only complaint about these collections is that they reprint only 
Sunday editions of Krazy, leaving out the smaller weekday comics. 
This is understandable; the huge amount of work it has taken to 
collect Sunday strips would have been multiplied sixfold to include 
weekday strips. Yet for completists, daily strips are still essential to 
understanding the whole breadth of Krazy Kat. Still, seeing that 
this classic comic is still being appreciated and printed is enough 
encouragement for fans of classic newspaper comics. Hopefully, 
future collections will also reprint color Sundays of Krazy, which 
was not printed in color until 1935.

his eyes in concern for my panting entrance.
Whos Marvin Frillis? I demanded. Mr. Knowles went white.
I... what are you talking about?
ul know all about it. It doesnt matter to me, but I need to know. Who is he? 
What did he do to you that you hate him so much? What on Earth does this have 
to do with academic challenge? Sweat began to bead on Mr. Knowless receding 
hairline. It glossed his smooth head.
You cant prove anything
Oh, come on! The kinetic friction thing alone is enough evidence. Plus, 
no one on the academic challenge teamand believe me, I asked everyoneeven 
knows who Marvin Frillis is. And last of all, I paused for dramatic effect, one of the 
messages was written with an overhead marker. I should have known right then that 
a teacher was the culprit!" Mr. Knowles began to sweat more profusely. I lowered 
my tone. But I truly dont carein fact, I find your messages entertaining. Im not 
interested in making any trouble. Im just so damned curiousI know thfere must be 
an amazing story behind this. So pleasetell me!
Mr. Knowles looked like a beaten hero. He threw his glasses onto his pile 
of papers and slid his hands over his face and across his balding head. He began 
slowly, ashamed, I was in high school almost fifty years ago. I went to a prestigious 
preparatory school in Vermont. I was captain of the academic challenge team. I 
was... going places. Not that that matters... Ive made teaching my life and I love 
that. But... when I was a senior I was chosen to lead the academic challenge team 
to its greatest season ever. Back then, academic challenge was something different. 
Its still glorious, but back then it was the most honorable thing anybody could con
ceive of. It was practically mythological. I saw sadness deep in Mr. Knowless eyes, 
and I almost asked him to stop. Anyway, I was the leader. I was the one everyone 
thought would make our team legendary. We were right on the edge. If we won our 
last meet, we would advance to the finals. It was our toughest match ever. It ended 
up going into overtime. Well, there was this other boy. Marvin Frillis. I had been 
chosen over him for captain of the team. He was smart, but reckless. He wasnt 
right for the job. And he hated me for it. Mr. Knowles stopped, rubbed the bridge of 
his nose, and sighed. After a few moments, he went on.
Somehow he must have sneaked behind me. I didnt even notice him till he 
was there, patting me on the back and wishing me luck just before we were about to 
begin the sudden death overtime. And then the moderator stopped. He asked me to 
turn around. There was a sign on my back. A crude thing. Nothing like kick me or 
something silly, something harmless and boyish like that. It was disgusting. It had 
been calculated to ruin me. The moderator reprimanded me in front of everyone 
both teams and all the spectators. Then he disqualified our school for un-sportsmanlike conduct, or as he phrased it, 'failure to behave like gentlemen. Nobody ever 
knew, no matter how much I insisted., that I was the victim, not the culprit. My reputation was soiled thenceforth.
Mr. Knowles... thats awful.
Im not a bitter person. I love my life and Ive moved on... but this being my 
last year teaching, my last year sponsoring the academic challenge team... its been 
difficult to cope, I guess. I just... needed some way to vent, after all these years, 
thats all. He turned his face away. I opened my mouth to say something, some
thing like I understand or itll all be okay. But I stayed silent.
Several days later I was meandering through the hallways, chomping on a 
luscious piece of spearmint gum. I ducked into a bathroom, performed the requisite 
routine, and made a successful excretion. While washing my hands I looked up, 
and saw in the reflection in the mirror a new piece of graffiti. I dried my hands and

I have lost the important sense of heat and cold.
This mornings coffee rolled sweet but tepid down my throat,No warmer, no cooler 
Than water from the sink.
Rain brushed me, empty melting beads of force, passed by 
Without either of us shivering.
I breathed on the palms of my hands, hoping to warm them,
Felt my breath leave me,
Felt a suggestion of motion
Against my cupped fingers, no more than a whisper.
Taking up fresh-printed pages, I knew their warmth only 
By seeing their words on my wrist.
I have lost the important sense of heat and cold.
to work on a four-dimensional system when it suddenly occurred to him 
there might be grounds for panic. Protruding out of thin air was what 
looked like a long, leathery, pale gray-blue leg with a sort of hand at one 
end and a hideous purple, oozing cross-section at the other. The hand, 
as it were, grasped a crumpled Coca-Cola can. This it threw with rather 
incongruous agility at Ruperts head. It hit him too. Now Rupert was 
panicked. He bolted toward the closet, intending to search for a shot
gun. The fact he did not own one was something his subconscious was 
unwilling to yet share with his panicked and desperate conscious. Upon 
reaching the closet, he turned to glance over his shoulder and saw that 
what he presumed to be the entire creature had emerged into our threedimensional space. It was not pretty. It comprised mainly a great many 
of those leathery legs with large, knotty, bulbous knees serving as a 
multitude of joints. In fact, it seemed to be almost entirely knees except 
somewhere in the middle, where a horrible, drooling, jagged orifice 
was located, and at the ends where the hands were. In some of these 
hands now was Ruperts substantially more dented 4-D Transporter. 
Yeesh! said Rupert as he ducked just in time to let the heavy metal 
projectile whoosh past his head and smash the closet door.
For lack of anything better, Rupert scurried into the kitchen, 
ripped the toaster from its perch and dashed back to the living room, 
almost slipping in his dress shoes. The thing was still there, hurling 
newspaper inserts all about the place. They were the semi-glossy kind. 
Rupert Malone cocked his surprisingly powerful arm back and hurled 
the toaster as hard as he could. It hit the leggy thing squarely in one of 
its knees. It yelped or belched, its hard to say, and then vanished, re
treating back a step in that precious fourth dimension. Rupert promptly 
set his house on fire and counted it a victory.
As he watched the flames growing from the vantage of the 
bench seat in his old pick-up, Rupert thought out what hed tell the 
press. The name Sludge Monster seemed appropriate, though he 
wasnt sure if it fit him or the leggy thing more. Either way, he was 
certain hed attach Atomic to the monsters title. He didnt want to 
frighten anyone with all that four-dimensional business and atomic mon
sters just felt so much more traditional. Whatever his story, at least he 
was dressed for an interview.

had company. I began to hear a scratching sound, like a robotic rat gnaw
ing a metal file. I craned my neck and peered out the tiny crack between 
the stall door and wall, i saw a pair of hands vigorously grinding a small, 
sharp instrument into one of the mirrors. I froze. It was him. I couldnt 
move. I didnt want to make him aware of my presence. Any guy who 
would go to such lengths to defile someone publicly probably wouldnt 
hesitate to kick my ass. I held my breath.
A moment later he was finished, and, much more calmly, slid out 
the bathroom door. I finished up as quickly as possible and, cursing my 
scruples as I took precious time to carefully wash my hands, exploded out 
of the bathroom. But the bell had rung for third period; the Defamer was 
long gone, and \ stood beside a river of bodies, faces and faces and faces 
beyond recognition.
I suddenly remembered the new graffiti. I stumbled back into the 
bathroom and examined the mirror. It was small in comparison to the 
others: the name Marvin had been encapsulated in the outline of a giant 
phallus, complete with hair in the appropriate areas. Dastardly.
I cant believe it! I yelled at Russell, throwing my backpack 
against a wall of lockers and slouching down to the floor with it. I was 
this close to finding out who it is, this close to finding out what Marvin 
Frillis did to this guy. You gotta understand, man, this isnt like a selfrighteous thing. Im not trying to play detective and bust the bad guy. I 
believe that whoever Marvin Frillis is, he deserves what hes getting right 
now. But I just cant stand not knowing what he could have possibly done! 
Who is Marvin Frillis? Who is Marvin Frillis! t
A break in the case came a full three months after I discovered 
the first piece of graffiti. Two new messages surfaced in the science wing 
bathroomone had been painted, with great care, inside the bowl of a 
urinal. It featured the name Marvin Frillis near the bottom of the uri
nal, and above it, with an arrow pointing to the name, was the message, 
Please pee on Marvin Frillis. The second piece of graffiti, written on the 
ceiling in the fattest black marker yet, was more remarkable. Marvin Fril
lis wouldnt know the coefficient of kinetic friction if it came up and [exple
tive] him in the [expletive]. Russell and I discussed it that afternoon over 
our economics homework.
What the hell? Friction? he said when I told him about the latest
Yeah, no joke... so... it has something to do with physics?
That makes no sense, he replied. But are there any serious 
rivalries in the physics club?
Theres a physics club?
Um, I thought so... there is in The Breakfast Club. We sat in si
lence, pondering without focus. I took out my Spanish notebook to review 
all the preceding bathroom slanders.
Nothing like that has ever been written before, I said. Noth
ing concrete like that. It must mean something; it must be important... of 
course it doesnt help matters that were totally clueless about whether or 
not theres any kind of physics-related activities happening anywhere at 
any given time around our own school... I slammed my notebook in dis
gust and slid it away from me. You know what? I shouted, Its probably 
just some freshman moron who thinks hes funny. And its pretty hilari
ous, isnt it, I continued, more and more aggravated, having two seniors 
running around like Magnum-goddamned-RI. trying to figure this crap out. 
Im sick of it! Russell just sighed.
At least were better looking than Tom Selleck, Russell offered 
in condolence. This led to many bushy mustache jokes and an overall 
hearty laugh, which dramatically improved our working environment. But I 
was still miffed.
The next day I sat in my last period physics class, and after the 
bell rang I remained, slumped in my seat, an unmoving biological sack.
Dr. Jansen looked at me, blankly suspicious. Did you... not hear the 
bell? he asked. I blurted out,
Whats the coefficient of kinetic friction? Dr. Jansen laughed
kindly.
I guess that was a pretty tough loss, eh?
What?
Arent you on the academic challenge team?
Nowhats the academic challenge team got to do with the coef
ficient of kinetic friction?
Well, they had a meet Monday nightand a terribly disappoint
ing lossby just one question. It was really frustrating.
Let me guessthe question dealt withfriction?"
Yeah. Theyve had a crummy season. I feel really bad for Mr. 
Knowles. Hes retiring this year, you know. Suddenly my head felt as 
if Id just bolted upright from a long reposeit tingled and pulsated as a 
sudden cosmic event materialized within it. I didnt say another word to 
Dr. Jansen. I scooped up my belongings and darted out the door.
Through the throngs of students rushing toward the open doors 
like a diverted river I squirmed, and finally managed to slide through them 
all. Rounding corners blindly, I sprinted from Dr. Jansens room, the deep
est in the science wing, to the opposite corner of the school. I burst into 
Mr. Knowless room to find him working dejectedly at his desk. He raised
Us
procedure, and rotated himself another half turn in the fourth dimension so 
as to be restored to his original state.
This time, after emerging from the metal tube, he slumped down on 
the couch and adjusted his underwear. He thought briefly of his triumph.
He thought of the video footage and of how he could very well be famous. 
Then he visibly shook off such notions and set about testing the machine 
to do what it was designed to do. He stood up and straightened his spine 
resolutely then marched over to the 4-D Transporter to boldly go where no 
introvert had gone before: out of space.
He didnt bother to make a video-Rupert this time. He shunned the 
camcorder for an old Polaroid he picked up off the coffee table on his way 
to the tube. This is how he would document the most stupendous scientific 
achievement of all time. It didnt even have a flash.
Had the camcorder been running, it would have seen much the 
same as it had grudgingly recorded before. When the door whisked shut, 
the machine just sat there, like a soup can without a label, for quite a while. 
Then it vanished altogether. The thick black power cord simply ended with 
its end hovering a few inches off the ground, its innards exposed in a per
fect, shining cross-section.
What the camera couldnt see is where Rupert was. With his 
marvelous moving phone booth, Rupert had taken a tiny step in a direction 
perpendicular to all of the directions us humans know and love. He and the 
machine had left our space. To verify this, Rupert slid open a small port
hole, backed by very thick glass, and peeped out with his impotent Polaroid 
in hand. What he saw was, well, nothing in particular. It was dark. Very 
dark. In retrospect, Rupert realized, it was foolish to suppose thered be 
light of some sort. He couldnt even assume light was possible in this alto
gether unknown three-dimensional space. And he didnt even have a flash. 
Damn. Darkness through a porthole really wasnt very good evidence that 
hed left his living room. Maybe the lights had just gone out because he 
blew a fuse. Damn. He hadnt turned the camcorder on so he could see 
if the cylinder vanished or not. Damn! He though for a moment and then 
decided to take a tremendous risk. He opened the glass porthole and, as 
the air rushed madly out of his tube, he flung the Polaroid out of the little 
window and hit the button that would move him back to his own space. In 
a flash and a belch, the tube refilled with air. And light from his living room. 
Rupert quickly whisked the door open and sprung out to look for the Pola
roid. It was nowhere to be found. Unless the toaster had hidden it, here 
was his proof He had actually moved a step in the fourth dimension. The 
machine was going to work perfectly.
He spent the next half a day (or night as he really didnt keep track) 
dressed as a plumber and running various diameter piping through his 
meager house. All of the pipes ended at tightly sealed fittings around holes 
he had cut in his marvelous metal can. There was a pipe running from the 
garbage disposal, a larger pipe from the toilet, a broad, stout pipe with a 
funnel shaped receptacle labeled TRASH jutting out from the side of the 
apparatus. Every conceivable source of waste in the house led, through 
a tunnel of metal, into the interior of the 4-D Transporter. When he had 
attached a pipe from everything he could think of, Rupert whisked open the 
door of the Transporter for what he supposed to be the last time. He fiddled 
with some controls on the inside and then stepped back out into his living 
room. This time without a passenger, the metal door whisked shut. The 
machine began whirring and then thumping. Rupert walked up and kicked 
it. It purred submissively then vanished. The grotesque assortment of 
pipes, all reaching like the tentacles of a great mechanical jellyfish toward 
the center of his living room, terminated abruptly in the air, each displaying 
a neat cross-section of itself. As a final touch, Rupert hung houseplants 
in front of all the pipe-ends, since he supposed the various sewage lines 
would be rather unseemly. Then he was done.
He had, in reality, solved the worlds waste problems. All he had to 
do was throw his trash down a chute and it would vanish, propelled by the 
machine a tiny bit in a direction perpendicular to all directions. As far as he 
could tell, there was an infinite supply of four-dimensional space to fill with 
trash. He though about telling the world this news, about relieving their 
environmental angst. But then he figured there really wasnt much point as 
he had previously doomed the entire universe anyway. No, he would keep 
it to himself. He sat down on the couch and gloated.
For days the system worked beautifully. At first, Rupert would take 
any excuse to throw something away just to watch it vanish. Slightly used 
pens, vaguely wrinkled paper, imperfectly shaped fruit, irritating pets. All 
got tossed, dumped, or flushed. After a while, of course, the novelty wore 
off and he simply used his facilities as one normally would, with the excep
tion that all his waste vanished from space.
Then one day, before even a month had passed, the system 
seemed to backfire. Rupert was watching television in his best suit, as 
was frequently his wont, when, much to his dismay, he was struck in the 
head with an old Polaroid camera. He naturally set about the room, wildly 
searching for the perpetrator of this offense. Just when he was about to 
finger the toaster, however, a gruesome plop assailed him from behind. 
When he turned, he saw, in the middle of his living room, surrounded by 
houseplants, a nasty heap of what appeared to be sewage. This was unac
ceptable. Rupert began to wonder just how much a plumber would charge

ii Benjamin C. Jantzen11. Rupert Malone and the Atomic Sludge Monster
Yeesh! said Rupert Malone, crumpling and scrunching his nose in dis
gust. He was standing in his living room, clad only in his underwear, and peeping 
through the eyepiece of his old VHS camcorder. He was working. In those days, 
Rupert generally worked in his underwear. What made him scrunch his nose 
was the tiny image of himself he saw in the video playback the camcorder was 
grudgingly providing. More specifically, he was mildly disgusted by the image of 
his own insides. To this point, the video had been rather boring.
At the beginning, it clumsily cuts in to a view of Rupert walking away, in 
his underwear of course, having just pushed the record button. He turns momen
tarily, crosses his arms, and opens his mouth as if to make some momentous 
speech. Despite the fact that the video playback provided no sound, Rupert 
knew nothing had come out. A speech seemed pretty stupid when he remem
bered he was in his underwear. After aborting his oration, he turns and contin
ues walking away from the camera, toward a smooth, shiny, and only slightly 
dented silver cylinder. It was about two feet taller than Rupert, roughly the size 
of a telephone booth. And it was standing in the middle of his living room with a 
monstrous power cable snaking away out the back of it. The tiny video-Rupert 
walks up to the cylinder, touches it in a seemingly arbitrary place, and grins as 
half of it whisks open, sliding into the back half and exposing the interior. He was 
very proud of that pointless futuristic effect he had built in. It took him longer to 
get that right than it did to come up with the 4-Dimensional Transporter in the first 
place.Video-Rupert steps inside. The front half of the cylinder whisks back 
into place, making the machine a smooth cylinder once again. Then, for quite 
a while, nothing happens in the playback. At least, without the sound going, it 
seems like nothing happens. But Rupert knew what he had been doing. He 
imagined the soundtrack. He imagined the low whirring, the thumping, the other 
thumping as he kicked the inside of the machine repeatedly, and finally the 
smooth whirring. Then something extraordinary happened in the little LCD of the 
camcorder. The video cylinder vanishes, leaving only a rectangle behind. The 
rectangle was framed in silver. There was a good deal of empty space. But in 
the middle was a gory cross-section of Rupert. Squinting harder in the eyepiece, 
he could now clearly make out the outline of video-Ruperts brain, heart, lung, 
skull, and a variety of assorted parts. Extraordinary. It had actually worked.
You see, Rupert had built a machine that allowed him to move in a 4th 
spatial dimension. Thats right, four. Left-right, front-back, up-down, and well, 
hither-thither. What he was looking at now was a test. He had rotated himself in 
the fourth dimension, out of our three-dimensional space and around the plane 
passing through his navel, nose and spine. That plane was the cross-section in 
the video. Rupert had explained the process to his toaster as follows (without, 
of course, explaining he had stolen the analogy from a book by Rudy Rucker).
Imagine a lowly, two-dimensional being confined to a plane. This plane is his 
whole world; he cannot conceive or experience motion outside of this plane.
Now image you, a three-dimensional monster, were to come along, grab one 
side of your 2-D victim and rotate him about a line lying in his planar home. Now, 
he would still be a 2-D being. But he would have been rotated in our 3-D space 
into a new plane and nearly completely out of the old plane he belongs in. In his 
planar world, all that would be left is a one-dimensional cross-section -- a line.
Quite analogously, Rupert had expounded to his befuddled appliance, a threedimensional being like himself, if rotated in a fourth spatial dimension, would 
leave only a hideous, two-dimensional cross section behind in his three dimen
sional home. This is what Rupert had done. But he completed the rotation. Like 
rotating the two-dimensional being of his example a full 180 degrees to bring him 
back into his original plane, Rupert, in his machine, made a full four dimensional 
rotation. Well, actually, he made a half-rotation. This is significant. Video-Rupert 
hasnt realized this yet.
The silver door swooshes open and video-Rupert leaps out. He runs to
ward the camera in a hurry to watch the playback.(disturbing since hes in his un
derwear). The video cuts out as clumsily as it cut in. Rupert put the camcorder 
down and thought for a moment. He had only made a half rotation. He was sure 
of it. He ran into the kitchen to yell at the toaster. Dont you get it! he shouted.
The toaster made no obvious reply. If we rotate a two-dimensional being 180 
degrees in our three dimensional space, he ends up back in his plane world, 
but he is his own mirror image. Still nothing from the appliance. You have no 
imagination, sighed Rupert. Then he scurried to the bathroom to look in the 
mirror. Indeed, his part was on the opposite side it had begun on this morning.
Plus, his crooked nose was crooked in an altogether new direction. Astounding.
Rupert didnt reflect long on his miraculous reflection before dashing 
back into the living room. He avoided the kitchen because he was certain that 
the toaster would gloat about his oversight. It had a nasty disposition. He was 
sure it would point out the imminent danger (and thus stupidity) of remaining a 
true mirror image of oneself. All living things rely quite heavily on proteins in their 
composition and general functioning. And all proteins in all living things on Earth 
share a common quirk: theyre left-handed. Its not important precisely what that 
means, Rupert thought at a particularly concerned looking lamp on his way back 
into the living room. The point is, any given protein is distinctly different from its 
mirror image. And Rupert was one big mirror image. Unlike every other living 
thing on earth, his proteins were, at that very moment, right-handed. He was in
compatible with food. In fact, he wasnt altogether certain his body was compat
ible with life. He jumped into the cylinder, repeated the whisking and thumping
USUIaai' If:
over my shoulder, I slid into the purple-painted stall and conducted a 
brief examination. Things looked good, so I began routine prepara
tions. Upon sitting down and relaxing, my eyes began to scan. I finally 
looked directly to my left and saw, to a mixture of my horror, surprise, 
and delight, a brand-new, brazen display. It was done in thick, perma
nent black markera real statement, if you ask me. Mostly theyre 
done in ballpoint pen, or theyre simply scratched into the wall. But 
black marker... that was serious business. I read, enraptured: Marvin 
Frillis likes to [expletive] with a [expletive] in his [expletive]. Back
wards. It was the greatest thing I have ever seen.
Aside from the relative wit involved in this latest piece of graffiti 
(and its startlingly delightful vulgarity) was the fact that that incident was 
merely the beginning; about a week later I was in the same bathroom, 
standing splayed before a urinal, when my eyes drifted up. There, in 
a thinner (though still permanent) black ink, was this message: Marvin 
Frillis is a [expletive] [expletive] who likes to [expletive] daily with [exple
tive], little boys and pink toy ponies. Other than the missing comma 
after boys, the grammar was impeccable. My shock soon turned 
into a weird joy, and I couldnt help laughing at poor Marvins expense. 
Somewhere along the line he must have pissed off some guy some
thing fierce, a guy with chutzpah and a Shaipie. A guy who wasnt 
afraid to use strong words... I had to meet him.
I went to my yearbook when I got home and looked up Marvin 
Frillis. He wasn't there. I was stuck for the time being.
The next day at lunch I asked Russell, an old friend, Have you 
ever heard of a kid named Marvin Frillis?
Uh, no... why?
Come with me. I led Russell, bewildered, to the music wing 
bathrooms. When he saw the graffiti he laughed until his stomach hurt.
So do you have any idea, he said after he finally calmed 
down, who this Marvin guy could possibly be?
No duethats why Im asking around. I also checked my 
yearbook last night and hes not in there. He must be new.
Or a freshman," Russell added.
Yeah. Is there even anybody in our entire school named Mar
vin?
Nope, not that I know of."
Hmm. And you didnt recognize the handwriting? Russell 
shook his head. Well... I guess well never know. Russell laughed 
again and we went back to lunch.
The next clue appeared two weeks later, this time in one of the 
horrendous bathrooms adjacent to the schools main hallway. Thank
fully I was only there to use a urinal... I have nightmares about those 
toilet seats. Anyway, this message was much shorter, and it was 
scratched neatly into one of the mirrors above a sink. It said plainly, 
MARVIN FRILLIS = BUCKET O [expletive]. Although not quite as 
funny, this latest graffiti was on par in vulgarity. My passion redoubled. 
So did the efforts of whoever so hated Marvin Frillis. One by one over 
the next several weeks, new messages appeared, each dreadfully of
fensive, scathingly executed, and strangely brilliant. One was written in 
glitter paint. One was written with a green overhead marker.
How do you know its an overhead marker? I asked Russell 
when he pointed it out.
Oh, its obvious, he began. Russell has sort of a... fetish for 
writing utensils (he calls himself a connoisseur). Its a bit weird, but 
his calligraphy is stunning. You can tell, first of ali, by the color. Its 
classic overhead green. Secondly, by the thickness of the line you can 
tell how much pressure was applied and how long the felt tip isits 
indicative of an overhead marker. And, of course, the clincher Rus
sell unrolled a square of paper towel, spat on it, and wiped it across the 
graffiti, erasing it cleanly.
Thats amazing,
thing that has ever amazed me., 
probably a thousand green over! 
shrugged.
I began a page at 
wrote down all the 
numerous they were begin 
tigative rampagewe asked every person we knew (and even some 
strangers) if theyd ever heard of Marvin Frillis, if they had any idea 
what ne had done and to whom to be the subject of such bold wrath. 
Everyone was clueless. We even considered taking out an ad in the 
local paper: Are you Marvin Frillis? Please contact... However dili
gently we pursued the truth, though, Russell and I remained clueless. 
And the graffiti piled up.
Once I nearly caught the vengeful student in the act. It was 
9:25, and I was doing my daily... well, I was in the bathroom, nice and 
cozy upon a fresh toilet paper nest. I heard the door fly open and slam 
shut, the culprit (whom by then I was calling the Defamer) must have 
been desperate, because hed gotten sloppy. A cursory look around 
would have alerted him to my feet, and he would have known that he

There are many
guidelines. Theyre not rulesa rule is a law,
something imposed by authority. A guideline is different. A guideline is for 
your own good. Guidelines are tried and true.
Firstly, (and this is after youve ascertained that you are alone), 
youve got to find a dean one. But thats not really even a guideline; its 
just common sense and sanitation. Most of the guidelines revolve around 
sanitation. Usually, just finding a clean one is the hardesf partI cant tell 
you how many times Ive deftly siunk out of class, put on an oh-lm-justhere-to-blow-my-nose-and-fix-my-hair charade until all other persons have 
left the bathroom, then, about ready to burst, flung open a stall door only 
to find... cigarette butts... or urine puddles... a vague smell of vomit... or, 
the absolute worst of all, a horrible, lumpy, murky brown, un-flushed gas
trointestinal catastrophe. Its enough to make a man crazy. And nause
ated.
So, assuming that youve been able to escape from class with am
ple time, find solitude, and stake as your claim an acceptably clean toilet, 
youve still got a process to go through (aside from the purely biological, of 
course). Once youre inside, door locked, youve reached a kind of tem
porary immunitypeople can come and go and as long as you stay quiet 
(and dont wear any kind of really outrageous or recognizable shoes), your 
identity is a secret. As I said, most of the guidelines regard sanitation; the 
others involve privacy. The world doesnt need to know when youre drop
ping a deuce.
Concerning sanitation: always give the toilet (no matter how clean 
it looks) a preliminary flush (with your foot, of course). Wiping the seat 
with toilet paper (no matter how clean it looks) is a good idea, too. The 
old toiiet-paper-on-the-seat technique is a good one as well. I always 
double uplogically, two layers offer more protection than one. But Im 
an innovator. I pioneered the following technique, a precaution against 
the second most horrendously unsanitary aspect of public defecation: the 
splash. We all know the splash. And somehow it always hits home. Im 
very proud of this precaution. It involves science
Over the top of any body of standing water (such as a toilet 
there lies a membrane of water, only a molecule thick. Underneath it 
the molecules are acting as molecules do, spinning carefree, doing their 
little atomic dances. But the polar nature of a water molecule acts as 
a very weak adhesive, joining those on top into a thin sheet. A splash 
occurs when this tiny sheet is broken; just about any degree of force 
can puncture it (after all, its only molecules) and cause a splash. How 
does one reinforce this membrane? With the greatest tool of the toilet 
of coursetoilet paper. By simply folding one iong sheet in half (again, 
doubling is always a good idea) and carefully laying it down into the bowl 
so that it floats smoothly on top of the still water, one can create a safety 
net of sorts for the upcoming deposit, one that wiil stifle a splash and, Ive 
discovered, prevent certain embarrassing sounds. Many a time Ive been 
at a urinal when from the stalls comes a sound like a potato dropping into 
a pot of water, and i say to myself, Man, that guy just got it where he 
dont want it."
Once all the precautions have been met, defecation can take 
place. I know that its odd for me to be such an expert, but my biologi
cal clock is completely out of my control If I had it my way, id make my 
daily solid excretion sometime in the late afternoon, when its convenient. 
Unfortunately, my body works on its own schedule; without fail, I feel the 
urge to poop every day between nine and ten a.m. That puts it smack in 
the middle of third period. Most premature ejaculators have better timing 
than that.
This situation of mine, while untimely, has had certain beneficial 
effects. I know the deanest bathrooms at school (those in the spe
cial sports teams section of the boys locker roomtheyre used after 
practice, cleaned, and then not used again until the next practice, after 
school. The one in the science wing will do in a pinch, and the one near 
the choral room is okay too, but when given a choice I always go for the 
locker room. I avoid the bathrooms adjacent to the main hallway like the
