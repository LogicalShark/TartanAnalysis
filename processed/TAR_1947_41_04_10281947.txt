with a recommendation that the 
societys budget be tabled pending 
an investigation into the value of 
the organization to the campus.
Council president Marshall ap
pointed Bell to make that investi
gation and to invite Lee Kirk 
Watkins, Beaux Arts president, to 
the next meeting of Council for a 
discussion of the status of his or
ganization.
WCIT Warmly Supported
When the WCIT budget was 
submitted, a situation the reverse 
of the one involving Beaux Arts 
Society appeared, as David Mintz

WCIT Fighting To Obtain Additional Budget 
For Transmissions To 20 Other Colleges
Tabling the Beaux Arts Society budget at the request of P & D 
junior Jerome Bell so that the place on campus of the organiza
tion can be investigated, Student Councils second meeting, held at
7:00 p. m. on October 30 in the Union, increased still further the
swift legislative pace set by the first meeting.
WCIT, fighting hard to obtain a much larger budget to replace 
makeshift equipment and improve the technical quality of its trans
mission so that it can become a^----------------------------------------------------
creditable addition to the net
work of the Intercollegiate Broad
casting System, received power
ful support from Council mem
ber David Mintz and president 
George Marshall.
But despite the favorable sen
timents of the Council, the only 
action taken was an investigation, 
to be led by David Mintz, into 
possible sources of additional 
funds for the stations.
Fully 18 positions on Council 
will be open for the next election, 
reported Robert Shapiro, chair
man of the Elections committee, 
as he reported that there is now 
an excess of Arts and MMCC rep
resentatives on Council.
Cheerleading Investigated 
Cheerleading was the subject of 
a report given by Norman Lar
sen. The information which he 
brought out caused Council to re
quest the appearance of Scotty 
Yurchison, head cheerleader, at 
the next Council meeting so that 
a further check can be made on 
the question of cheerleaders and 
cheerleading sections.
Budgets also apeared on the 
agenda. Nine were passed with 
little difficulty, but the Technical 
budget preripitated some acrid 
remarks by Negley Reed, chair
man of the publications commit
tee, and much explanation by the 
Technicals business manager,
Milton Perloff.
Beaux Arts Attacked 
As soon as the Beaux Arts So
ciety budget was presented to the 
meeting for approval, Ernie Snoyer asked about the present status 
of the societys annual ball.
Jerome Bell took the floor im
mediately and stated that he 
doubted that the existence of the 
organization on campus was jus
tified.
They had nothing to their ac
count during the whole of last 
year, he continued, and were 
forced to discontinue the Beaux 
Arts Ball.
Bell completed his comments

CIT Meets W&J 
At Washington
Donahoe Promises Thrills As Team Improves Rapidly
Next Saturday at 2:30 the Car
negie Tartans tangle with the W 
and J Presidents at College field 
in Washington, Pa. This game 
shapes up as a real thriller after 
the gallant display put on by the 
Skibos last week against Geneva.
Coach Bill Donahoe has his 
charges keyed for this encounter. 
As everyone knows, Carnegie was 
late getting started again this sea
son and as a result they were not 
in shape for the Wesleyan tilt.
Against Geneva, the injury rid
dled Carnegie team made its own 
breaks as it battered the larger 
Geneva team time and again, 
causing them to fumble.
This week our boys will be out 
in an attempt to reverse last years 
spectacle which W&J took by a 
48-0 score. The Presidents again 
are paced by Deacon Dan Towler, 
speedy negro fullback, who was 
the star of last seasons encounter. 
As Towler goes, so goes W&J.
Needless to say, Coach Donahoe 
has his boys primed to stop Dea[Continued on page 11]

Mr. Duffett, who will be pre

Relatively little damage beyond 
several broken windows and

Chief among the casualties were

Action Will Be Taken 
To Better Cheerleading
Candidates Claim They Did Not Have Enough 
Opportunity To Display Skill At First Tryouts
 Immediate action will be taken to improve the quality of 
cheerleading, Buddy Overend, director of athletics, declared 
when approached by councilman Norm Larson who was inves
tigating the situation described in a letter to the* Editor of the 
Tartan as very aromatic in a dead sort of a way.
Explaining his reason for the investigation, Norm said, 
  During the past year I have noticed that the cheerleaders 
have become more and more lax. The letter to the Editor of 
the Tartan convinced me that it was time for action.
Norm started by approaching Ben David, Assistant Dean 
of Men. Dean David revealed that several candidates claimed
?they were not given sufficient 
chance at the first tryouts for
cheerleaders.
Overend in Charge
Referred to director Overend 
Norm discovered that the cheer
leaders were under the control of 
the athletic office. Overend said 
that he had not been aware that 
there was anything wrong, but he 
promised immediate action.
Overend then called in the 
cheerleaders and discussed the 
situation with them. Both he and 
Dean David were present at the 
second tryout for girls held last 
Wednesday, and Norm Larsen was 
invited to the boys tryouts on 
Tuesday.
The athletic office did not be
lieve any changes would be made 
during the football season, but by 
basketball season something 
would be done.
Lorsen Comments
Commenting on the progress 
made, Norm Larsen said, I have 
found that the complaints were 
well-founded, but I believe that 
the action being taken by Mr. 
Overend will do much to remedy 
the situation. However, I dont 
believe all the fault lies with the 
cheerleaders. Student cooperation 
is necessary at all times.
A junior in the department of 
printing, Norm is a member of 
Student Council, and is conduct
ing this investigation as a part of 
his duties with the student gov
erning body. He is a member of 
the Intramural board, and a 
writer on the Tartan sports staff, 
both activities reflecting his in
terest in the problems of college 
athletics.

5000 Pitt Students Invade 
CIT Campus To Celebrate Win
Fraternity Exchange Dinners 
Proposed At IF Council Meeting
 ------------------ ?---------------------------------------VInterchanging groups of men for dinner so that the various 
fraternity men might become better acquainted was the proposal 
made by president George Bickerstaff at an October 20 meeting of 
Interfraternity council, held in IH 135-C. The proposal touched off 
an hour of excited discussion.
Every so oftenpreferably at least once a week said Bicker
staff, five men from each fraternity would visit another house 
for dinner, with their hosts send-^
ing back five men in return at the 
same time.
Thus the various fraternity 
people would really have a chance 
to know each other as friends, not 
as nodding acquaintances.
That the pledge trainers of the 
houses meet and prepare a pro
gram which would permit their 
class to know each other was the 
second proposal brought forward 
by Bickerstaff. '
Extending mutual cooperation a 
step further, Steven Nehez of 
Delta Upsilon was appointed as 
chairman of a committee of stew
ards and house managers which 
will meet shortly to examine pos
sible collective methods of pur
chasing food, in order to deal 
with the rapidly mounting prob
lems resulting from the present 
price tendencies.
The discussion of the key pro
posal of the meeting, that which 
would have a constant exchange 
of dinner visits, was continuous 
and voluntarily noted Bickerstaff. 
One fraternity president or repre
sentative after another gave his 
approval to the broad outlines of 
[Continued on page 6]Bill Bickerstaff
been dented as the result of some 
overenthusiastic Pitt cheerlead
ing.
First warning of the attack was 
received when a long motorcade 
swept onto the campus from the 
rear through the Schenley park 
gateway. The racing cars moved 
rapidly through CIT territory on 
a reconaissance which took them 
through Frew, Tech, and Mar
garet Morrison streets.
Reaching Forbes street, they 
turned off and headed toward the 
Cut, where a traffic blockade was 
quickly formed. Protected by 
this barrier, thousands of Pitt 
foot soldiery inundated the cam
pus through the Cut break
through zone.
There was no opposition at 
first, and soon the flood split into 
two parts, one attacking Indus
tries hall and the other breaking 
into Skibo.
Skibos normal noon crowd was 
suddenly doubled as an Indianfile column of Pitt men marched 
in, singing Hail to Pitt and car
rying a pair of somewhat bat
tered goal posts.
Industries hall was secured 
shortly afterward and the whole 
mob congregated on the Fine Arts 
lawn to sing Hail to Pitt a few 
more times and make an attempt 
to permanently record Pitt 12 
in concrete on the asphalt of Mar
garet Morrison street.
At this point the languid Car
negie school spirit appeared, and 
several large buckets of water 
were poured into the Pitt mob by 
some artistic and architectural 
bombardiers.
Police forces finally arrived, and 
the invaders began to retire, 
shouting and waving a number of 
captured flags and other trophies.

IF Attacks Prejudice
George Bickerstaff, president of Interfra
ternity council, has proposed that the campus 
fraternities arrange a system whereby dinner 
visits will be made by the members of each fra
ternity, a few at a time, to all of the other 
fraternities.
The Tartan has given this story a prom
inent position on page one. This positioning 
was not done haphazardly, nor as an indica
tion of a pro-fraternity attitude. But the news
paper did go out of its way to obtain full in
formation on this unaccountably obscured 
move. Why?
Because this is the first fundamentally 
sound proposal we have heard on this campus 
which may be able to do something effective 
to reduce the intensity of prejudices at CIT.
Our religious, educational, and political 
leaders have long since become accustomed to 
spurting diffuse, silvery clouds of stuff on 
the subject of prejudice at appropriate inter
vals.
Much Talk, Little Action
CIT itself has been the scene of speeches 
of this nature. Religious Emphasis Week and 
Brotherhood Week are usually used for the 
purpose, with other occasions being diluated 
with more of this talk whenever the speaker 
feels in needs of some safe organic filler ma
terial.
The Tartan has also assisted in this 
fight, trumpeting hard about the iniquity of 
the whole situation, and calling loudly for 
more brotherly love.
The psychologist, however, will call this 
approach unsound, for general words which 
are not (and cannot) be accurately defined, 
and which are not backed up by a well-defined, 
un-self-conseious example of their applications, 
will have little effect on most people.
But when a group of men visits another 
club, an organization with which they are 
already slightly acquainted and with whose 
members they have many interests in common, 
a different situation will be set up.
A Good Dinner, A Good Beginning
These dinners may begin as stiff and un
comfortable affairs, but when a fraternity table 
becomes accustomed to such visitations, it will 
quickly relax into its natural and informal self. 
And its guests will relax with their hosts.
When a man has a chance to talk with an
other man over a good dinner, the limited com
munication that school etiquette usually de
mands must be abandoned if one is to become 
a part of an atmosphere of roast beef, ciga
rette smoke, and noisy jokes.
And when a man leaves such a dinner, no 
matter how much he may dislike the host fra
ternity, its policies, and its religion, no mat
ter how much he has been told that what he 
has seen is dangerous to all right thinking 
men, his eyes and his intelligence will bring 
up questions to which his prejudices may 
never again be able to provide entirely satis
factory answers.
Says Who?
By Carl Klahr
Benny was the sort of guy who isnt taken in 
by all the propaganda floating around. About 
working, for one thing. He couldnt see any reason 
to work for longer than it takes to buy some 
corned beef sandwiches and a few beers. And 
clothes for another.
Having developed a fin case of reasonable con
ceit, Ben couldnt see the point in wearing a sleek 
sack suit to impress people, all of whom were 
inferior to himself. So he would lean all day against 
one of the iron T-beams of the Eighth avenue ele
vated and pass the time of day in dialectic con
templation of the universe, with buddies who were 
of the same mind. In short, Benny was a bum; 
or, as the psychology textbooks have it, a well 
adjusted individual.
Benny Was Bum
Of course he was on the receiving end of some 
pretty ugly language from people who had been 
taken in by the oppositionhonest, industrious, 
sweaty people. Especially Old Man Morgan, who 
ran an employment agency for the railroad used to 
cuss Ben in a very vile way for setting such a 
beach-comberlike example for the young bums 
who wouldnt work on the gandy shifts anymore. 
A less phlegmatic man would have gone for Mor
gan with a knife, but Benny didnt think it worth 
the effort.
Like all strong men, however, Benny had a 
Delilah, and to his great misfortune she turned 
out to be the daughter of Old Man Morgan. He 
saw her visit her pop one day, and from then on 
there were uneasy stirrings in that vacant lumberroom which philosophers would call Bennys soul. 
He actually turned his turtlenecked sweater inside 
out so the cleaner side would show, pushed back 
his cowlick and greeted the Morgan damsel with a 
whistle. Then the Old Man hatched a fiendish 
plot, Delilah Morgan would vamp Benny into go
ing to work.
The Remodeled Bum
Trust a Delilah to bait the hook very effective
ly! Within a week a wave of sensational unbelief 
swept thru Bennys Eighth avenue disciples. He 
was actually working on the gandy shift, and 
working like a steam demon. In fact the manager 
was about to promote Benny when Delilah thought 
she had enough of that remodeled bum, and told 
him that since his psychopathy was cured she was 
through with him. This made the man not sad but 
angry. When he thought of the purple-eyed mon
ster Morgan, and of his equally purple-eyed daugh
ter, who wanted to make him a servile serf of 
labor, the usually placid Benny became possessed 
of yellow-eyed demons of revenge, and he decided 
to continue working to get the power, power, 
power to put his revenge into tangible form.

Letter to the Editor
About Says Who?
Editor, the Tartan
The feature Says Who? of the last issue of 
the Tartan has been written with a self-confident 
air that in reality shows little knowledge of the 
actual political situation in South America, and in 
general of the world.
I admire Mr. Klahr for his very active imag
ination, but I think that to write such an article 
requires more information that just what is gath
ered from the weeklies. Many of us, unluckily for 
Carl Klahr, read those weeklies, and still others 
have more than once been in Argentinalong 
enough to appreciate the political situation with
out the help of an interpreter who frequently is 
not impartial or who is not fully understood by the 
correspondents of those weeklies.
If Mr. Klahr were familiar with Argentina, he 
would know that there always was red wine and 
inch-thick steaksalways, in wartime or peace, 
with or without Peron (and pretty cheap too). I 
would like to know exactly what he means by, 
Even if their material benefits have been slight. 
Does he mean that the economic independence of 
Argentina is not an important step in the future 
welfare of that country?
America, altogether, freed itself politically from 
Europe over a century ago, and that was called 
liberty; now Argentina tries to free its commerce 
and industry from European economic control, and 
Mr. Klahr calls it Fascism.
I would like to know if any United States citi
zens would consider Perons system Fascism if 
their own railroads, meat packing concerns, pub
lic utilities and many other basic industries were 
under European economic control.
A country does not gain complete freedom if 
it is not economically independent Thanks to that 
Fascism, Argentina among other things has been 
able to get rid of the Communists. If Carl Klahr 
calls that fascism, then I am a fascist and so are

CIT Press Approves Two Books 
Toward First Publications
With the approval of two books 
for its initial publications, the CIT 
Press has made its first concrete 
move toward an appearance in the 
nations bookstores.
The Book Publishing commit
tee, which will administer the
Press, has accepted Encores in 
Main Street: Successful Commun
ity Theater Leadership, by Pro
fessor Talbert Pearson of the 
* drama depart0F Ten. ment, and
Basic Type 
Faces and How 
to Use Them 
by Pro f e s s o r 
Stanley Hlasta, 
member of the 
printing facul
ty.
Both books 
are tentatively 
titled, with the 
former sched
uled for the spring and the
latter for a year from now. Both 
also represent clearly the objec
tives of the CIT Press, the pub
lication of works of significant 
value.
Since these books are of a schol
arly nature, much research was 
required for their successful com
pletion.
This research, said Mr. Stan
ley March, secretary of the Pub
lishing committee and head of the 
Public Relations bureau, will 
make Professors Hlasta and Pear
son better instructors for the effort 
which they have put into it.
The school will thus benefit not 
only from the additional diffusion 
of knowledge in fields of study 
with which it is concerned, but 
will be further enriched by the 
improved services of two men 
who are already leaders in their 
work.
Work Done at Rutgers
The actual production and mer
chandising operations involved in 
the CIT Press will be completed
by the large plant and organiza
tion of the Rutgers University 
Press, but all of the material used 
will be selected by Carnegie Tech 
and will bear the CIT imprint.
Since the primary purpose of 
the Book Publishing committee is 
the promulgation of educational 
works, it is not limiting its con
sideration to books authored at 
CIT, but will examine any ma
terial of a suitable nature which 
is submitted.
Royalties to Authors
Authors will be remunerated on 
a royalty basis in the manner of 
any publishing house, and will 
receive the further assistance of 
sponsorship by a university which 
is internationally known for its 
achievements.
The symbol to be used for the 
CIT Press is the dolphin and this
tle, overprinted with the name of 
the organiation. The unusual story 
behind the symbol illustrates nice
ly the deftness of its selection.
Originally designed in 1932 by 
a group of printing students as 
the mark of their department, it 
is a modification of the trademark 
used by Aldus Manutius, an Ital
ian printer of the late fifteenth and 
early sixteenth centuries.
Symbol has History
Manutius was the pocket-book 
man of his day, printing the Greek 
and Roman classics in books 
measuring four and a half by six 
inches with a condensed but legi
ble italic type. As much a pub
lisher as a printer, the medieval 
craftsman wished to see these 
works receive what he thought 
would be proper distribution, and 
thus departed from the tradi
tion of printing only books of a 
religious nature.
The symbol chosen for the CIT 
Press, substituting a thistle for the 
lower portion of the anchor con
tained in the original design, is 
thus indicative of the educational 
purposes of the new organization.

The drama department will open 
its season with Secret Service, 
a play concerning underground 
action during the siege of Rich
mond in the Civil War. It was 
written in 1898 by William Gil
lette, a famous actor of that day.
Playing Captain Thorn of the 
Confederate Army, the part Gil
lette intended for himself, are 
Louis Edmonds and Kenneth Garlinger. Jane Hughes and Renee 
Grkin share the romantic lead as 
Edith Varney, daughter of Con
federate General Varney. Robert 
Casey and George Williams will 
appear as Wilfred Varney, Ediths 
young brother, and Mrs. Varney, 
their mother, will be done by Mary 
Gibson and Kay Thompson. Gaye 
Jordan and Sada Thompson are 
cast in the role of Carolyn Mitford, a young Richmond girl; Bill 
Ross and Vincent OBrien take the 
"heavy role of Mr. Arrelsford; 
and the principals are rounded out

Silverman Elected 
Managing Editor 
By Tartan Board
Continuing its reorganization, 
the Tartan editorial board has an
nounced the election of Harry Sil
verman, printing junior, manag
ing editor, at an election on Tues
day, October 24.
Other members elected at the 
meeting included Shirley Seiner, 
Margaret Morrison, as make-up 
editor; Francis Brandi, P & D 
junior, as art editor; and Otto 
Abraham, engineering sophomore, 
as circulation manager.
Harry, who has been on the 
Tartan for the past two years, 
served capably as make-up editor 
on last years staff. This year it 
will be his headache to keep tabs 
on the make-up, photography and 
art departments of the paper. Be
sides the effort he puts in on the 
Tartan, Harry devotes quite a bit 
of his time to promoting APO. 
He is also an active member of 
WCIT.
Shirley, the only girl holding 
down a post on the editorial 
board, is majoring in English. 
Outside of class she divides her 
time between WCIT, the Student 
Federalists and IRC.
Frank, bringing his talent from 
the painting and design depart
ment is a member of the Student 
Council. Otto, majoring in me
chanical engineering, is president 
of the Intramural Board.
Dormitories Will 
Hold Closed Dance
The first social event of the year 
sponsored by the mens dormitory 
council will be a dance to be held 
in the lovely setting of the Pitts
burgher room in the William Penn 
hotel on November 22. Dancing 
will begin at 8:30 to the strains 
of Bill Leroys popular orchestra.
The dance will be a closed af
fair with all tickets going to res
idents of the mens dormitories and 
their dates. Tickets will be distributed in the dormitories around 
November 15.
Council members indicated that 
this years fall dance shows every 
sign of being a big success, and 
they urge all dormitory residents 
to attend.
More than 3000 music lovers 
attended the first concert of the 
Pittsburgh Symphonys twentyfirst season at the Syria Mosque 
last Friday night.
Dr. Fritz Reiner, the orchestras 
distinguished conductor, was 
warmly received as he took the 
podium to start his tenth year 
here.
The first half of the concert 
was devoted to the music of the 
Russian composers of the last 
century  Glinka and Tschaikowsky. Glinkas overture, Rus
sian and Ludmilla, although 
played with much spirit, fell 
short for it lacked clarity and en
semble.
Tschaikowskys Fifth Sym
phony, next on the program, ap
pealed to the audience as it al
ways does, and though notewor
thy for the exceptional French 
horn solo by Tiber Shik in the 
second movement, was not up to 
par because the orchestra has not

Action in the campaign to re
store the King of Hearts Ball to 
the years social calendar slowed 
this week as backers of the move 
awaited the results from several 
copies of the petition posted in 
various places around campus.
Interfraternity council took ac
tion on the question last week, and 
according to President George 
Bickerstaff, passed a motion rec
ommending that the King of 
Hearts Ball will not be held this 
year.
Bickerstaff gave as the coun
cils reasons for opposing the af
fair the considerable amount of 
time and money which each of the 
fraternities spent on it last year. 
The fraternities do not consider 
that the returns from the King of 
Hearts Ball could possibly justify 
such expenditures.
The decision of the fraternities 
not to support the ball was unani
mous and came after careful con
sideration of every house.
Proposed changes in the cam
paign would restrict voting to 
women students, and limit cam
paign expenses to fifty dollars.
In answer to this proposal to 
limit campaign expenditures, 
George Biekerstaff queried, And 
how would you check each fra
ternity to make^ sure that it is 
not spending igf.e than the al
lotted $50?
Approximately 300 signatures 
were recorded on the various cop
ies of the petition. Scimitars and
Cwens, who indicated their will
ingness to drop the Soph Hop that 
was originally scheduled for the 
night of March 6, are delaying ac
tion on the question until the re
sults of the petition are deter
mined.
Dave Mintz, serving on Scimi
tar in an advisory capacity, en
gaged in a discussion of the issue 
with Jack Seward during last 
weeks council meeting. Mintz 
stated that Scimitar would take 
no action until they had a better 
idea of the sentiment of the en
tire campus.
Ernie Snoyer, who protested the 
omission of the Ball from the so
cial calendar and enlisted the 
Cwens and Scimitars in a drive to 
restore it, said that because of the 
tremendous excitement aroused 
during the last two years, the cam
paign should not be allowed to 
lapse.
Blood Donors Are 
Urgently Needed
Blood donors are urgently need
ed by the Veterans hospital in Aspinwall. The blood bank is open 
every Thursday from 1:30 to 5:00. 
Anyone in good health and be

Seven Classes 
Plan Reunions
Lehigh Game To Climax 
Gala Weekend Events
A big turnout of their members 
for homecoming has been indi
cated by the reunion classes. If 
the weather is favorable about 
500 alumni are expected to return 
for the weekend of festivities.
Although arrangements for the 
class of 1912 are still pending, the 
other classes have completed plans 
for special luncheons and dinners. 
For the other alumni a full pro
gram for Friday and Saturday, 
November 14 and 15, has been 
prepared.
Meetings, Lunches Scheduled
On Friday morning the alumni 
will register at the Carnegie Un
ion. Then during the afternoon 
the Pittsburgh Womens Clan will 
sponsor a reception and tea in the 
Union. More alumni will register 
Saturday morning, after which 
the Alumni Council will hold its 
annual meeting, also in the Un
ion.
A general homecoming lunch
eon is scheduled in Skibo at noon 
before the Lehigh-Carnegie Tech 
game at 2:30. In the evening all 
the fraternities will have openhouses while at the Union there 
will be an all-sorority gathering 
at the same time.
Class Dinners Planned 
Several special luncheons and 
dinners have been planned by the 
reunion classes. On Saturday the 
girls of several classes will have 
luncheons  the class of 22 in 
the Ruskin apartments, the class 
of 27 in the College club, and 
that of 37 at the University club. 
The girls of 32 and 42 have 
scheduled a dinner at the Ruskin 
apartments in the evening.
On Saturday evening the men 
will also have their special din
ners. The class of 17 has arrang
ed for its dinner in the Hotel 
Schenley. The University club will 
be the setting for dinners for the 
classes of 22, 27, and 32. The 
alumni of the Arts College plan 
a dinner at the Royal York din
ing room on Saturday evening, 
and the graduates of the Arts and 
Engineering colleges, class of 1942, 
will hold their dinner at Hotel 
Webster Hall.
Playhouse Tickets 
Sold To Public
The Pittsburgh playhouse re
announced its policies this week 
in an attempt to correct certain 
misapprehensions which have ris
en concerning the playhouse.
All performances are open to 
the public. Performances are held 
Monday through Saturday nights, 
and tickets are on sale at the play
house and at Gimbels.
Seats for week-day perform
ances cost $1.36, including tax, 
while the Saturday seat price is 
$1.63. Tickets may be purchased 
in blocks of seven for $9.00.
The Playhouse is not an amateur 
producing group, as many people 
believe. Some of the actors are 
paid only nominal expense money 
and in this sense are non-professional. However, the Playhouse is 
operated by a large paid staff, and 
can hardly be classed with little 
theatre groups, which are run 
entirely by volunteers.
headquarters in the Wabash sta
tion, GRant 1680.
The need for whole blood by 
the veterans at Aspinwall has 
reached an acute stage, a Red 
Cross official explained. Medical 
authorities agree that use of whole 
blood transfusions is no longer 
looked upon as only an emergency 
act. Rather, they have learned 
that transfusions can hasten the 
recovery of convalescing patients. 
At the same ti ne it was pointed 
out that donors will also learn 
their own blood type and RH fac
tor, which are tabulated for each 
volunteer.

THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, OCTOBER 28, 1947
Harriers Top 
Geneva, 26-29Tartans Defeated, 40-12, By Geneva; 
Stop Visitors For Three Quarters
Davies, Johnson Place 
High In First Home Meet
Carnegie Techs Cross Country 
team, minus the services of Bill 
Beamer, opened the 1947 season 
with a 26 to 29 victory over the 
visiting Geneva College entry at 
Flagstaff hill on Saturday, Oc
tober 25.
Caskey Takes Honors
Covering the five mile course it) 
26 minutes and 27 seconds, Joe 
Caskey took the individual hon
ors for Geneva. Ivor Davies, Tar
tan captain, followed at 26:47.5, 
while close on his heels came 
team-mate Bill Johnson, a fresh
man, who was timed at 26:56.5.
The Covenanters Bill Bloom 
took fourth just eight seconds in 
front of Gene Cockrell who fin
ished in 27:12. Sixth place went to 
Jim Steel of Geneva who was 
followed by Techs Bill Rearn.
Mel Blair scored in eighth place 
for the losers and Ed Shoemaker 
ended the Plaid scoring in ninth 
position. Six other Carnegie men, 
Bob Herbert, John Mays, Bob 
Munger, Vic Clay, George Bach, 
and Frank Beitel finished in that 
order.
Injuries Hamper Squads
Injuries hampered both squads 
efforts for victory. The locals Fred 
Price failed to finish due to in
tense pain in his shoulder result
ing from a fall on a soft spot on 
the course. From all indications he 
has recovered and will start in 
next Fridays meet. Ted Dalby of 
Geneva also failed to finish after 
injuring his ankle.
Next Friday Coach Guy Halferty will lead the Tartan harriers 
against Westminister at New Wil
mington, Pa. The Titans ran up 
five consecutive victories prior to 
last Saturday when Pitt snapped 
the streak with a 15-40 score.
CIT hopes received a boost 
when it was announced that 
Beamer, who has been withheld 
from action because of a class 
room injury, is expected to be 
ready for the engagement.

Gym Facilities 
Made Available 
To All Students
Mr. Moses has announced that 
students who are not required to 
attend gym classes may enjoy the 
facilities that the athletic depart
ment has to offer. The gym and 
the equipment may be used by 
anyone when it is available.
Squash, handball, badminton, 
and various pieces of gymnastic 
equipment are obtainable upon 
presentation of a registration card, 
which is kept as security until the 
equipment is returned.
The pool, which is now under 
repairs, will probably open next 
week and will also be available. 
Towels and other furnishings are 
provided by the school. This plan 
also permits the use of the fields 
for work-outs at any time.
All men who are not regularly 
scheduled must obtain their own 
personal equipment and combina
tion lock, whereupon they will 
be assigned lockers at the gyms 
equipment room. In past years, 
groups of ex-G. I.s have taken 
advantage of this plan at the 
11:30 hour, which is always open. 
This plan was put into effect main
ly for the benefit of those who like 
to work out now and then. Every
body is urged to take advantage 
of it.
Machinery Hall Room 
Will Be Air Conditioned
The mechanical engineering de
partment has received a complete 
one-ton refrigeration unit from 
the war surplus. The senior class 
is changing this into an air con
ditioning unit and will air condi
tion room 10 in Machinery Hall.
The Skibo booters lost to Slip
pery Rock last Friday afternoon, 
1-0, in a hard fought game played 
on the FPHA field.
Although determined to avenge 
two defeats sustained at the hands 
of the Teachers during 1946 
the Tartan efforts again were in 
vain as they dropped the latest 
game in this traditional series.
The Tartans failed to capitalize 
on two great scoring opportunities. 
Twice Don Hart, Carnegie Techs 
inside left, was fouled when he 
was in scoring position. Each time 
the Tartans were awarded free 
penalty shots, but neither free kick 
was converted.
On the first one, Harper, the 
Slippery Rock goalie, made a mi
raculous save and the second try 
hit the cross bars, only to bounce 
back into the playing field. After 
these scoring oportunities, the Ski 
bos failed to muster sufficient 
punch to deadlock the game. 
Slippery Rock Scores Once
Slippery Rock scored its only tal
ly five minutes after the opening 
whistle on a fluke shot which 
trickled through DorfFs legs. This 
slim margin they managed to 
hold for the remainder of the 
game.
The loss was a costly one for 
Carnegie, for soon after the open
ing whistle Howie Gartner, left 
winger, was tripped near the 
sidelines and broke his ankle. His 
loss will be keenly felt for it hits 
the team in one of its weakest 
positions.
Expert Playing Is Margin
Marty Dorff, Jack Burvey, A1 
Gelbin, and Ed McGehee were 
the outstanding players on the 
Tartan squad. Their fine and un
tiring work broke up many Slip
pery Rock threats and kept Car
negie Tech threatening until the 
very last minute.
New Wilmington Next
This coming Friday the Tartans 
will invade New Wilmington, Pa., 
where they will oppose Westmin
ister. The Titans have a very 
strong team this year, undefeated 
in its first four starts.
Lineups:
Maley goes over for Carnegies first touchdown. Also in the play 
are Meyers (48), Highberger (25), Sommer (10) and Madden (51).

Intramural Board Chooses 
Officers For Coming Year
At its first meeting of the 47- 
48 school year, the CIT Intra
mural board elected new officers 
and discussed plans for reinstat
ing the sportsmanship cup as part 
of its plan for a bigger and better 
intra-mural program.
Otto Abraham of Tau Delta Phi 
was elected to the presidency in 
a very closely contested election. 
Howie Gartner, Beta Sig, is the 
new vice-president and the ATOs 
Norm Larsen was given the secre
tarial position.
Plans are being made for the 
presentation of a sportsmanship 
trophy which will be awarded at
Rifle Team
Tryouts for the Carnegie 
Tech Varsity Rifle Team will 
start this week on the Margaret 
Morrison range. The team, 
'which was reactivated last year 
for the first time since the war, 
had a very successful season 
and expectations are again 
high for this year.
The tryouts will be held on 
Wednesday, Thursday and Fri
day of this week. The times 
will be Wednesday, 9-10:30 and 
1:30-3:30; Thursday, 9-11:30 
andl:30-3:30; and Friday 9- 
10:30 and 1:30-3:30.

basement of Margaret Morrison 
and can be reached most easily 
through the door which faces 
the Tech bowl.
the end of the year to the organ
ization which has proven itself 
outstanding in sportsmanship. 
Basis for the award will be the 
officials report on the attitude 
and conduct of the competing 
teams and their supporters. The 
cup itself will compare with the 
all-points trophy in value and will 
be permanently awarded.
Rule X, section 2, was changed 
to read: A blocked kick may be 
received and run by the defensive 
or receiving team but may only 
be received and downed by the 
offensive or kicking team.
All intra-mural managers must1 
appoint a representative of their 
organization to make a short re
port on the highlights of their 
game and drop it in the WCIT 
box in Skibo immediately after 
the game. Such action will result 
in complete coverage of intra
murals by WCIT and the Tartan.
On Saturday, October 25, the 
Carnegie Tech football team 
was defeated at Forbes Field 
by the Covenanters of Geneva 
college. The fiinal score was 
40-12.
After a gallant fight through 
the first three quarters, during 
which the visitors led the Plaid 
by only one touchdown, the 
Covies tallied three more touch
downs in the fourth period.
The visitors scored first and led 
during the entire game but the 
Carnegie team kept fighting and 
pushing all afternoon.
Geneva Scores Its First
In the first period, after long 
funs by Adam Karcis and Jim 
Pietro, the Geneva team scored 
its first touchdown from the one 
jard line when Edwards went 
over on a quarterback sneak.
The extra point was good when 
the ball struck the upright and 
bounded between the goal posts. 
The Covenanters next score came 
early in the second quarter on a 
pass to the left end who was all 
alone on the left sideline. The play 
covered a distance of about 25 
yards. The conversion for the ex
tra point was wide and the score 
stood at 13 to 0 in favor of Ge
neva. ,,-
Pass Intercepted, Fumbled
After the next kick-off which 
Stovicek returned to the Carnegie 
39 yard line, Larry Maley threw 
a pass intended for Russ Cooper 
which was intercepted and then 
fumbled by a Geneva back. The 
ball was recovered by a Tartan 
lineman and the Skibos had a first 
down on the Geneva 48 yard line.
Larry Maley then threw a 25 
yard pass to John Williamson 
who worked his way down to 
the Geneva 25 yard line before be
ing stopped.
In the next three plays Maley 
picked up 11 yards through the 
center of the line and Highberger 
took the ball to the 5 yard stripe. 
After three plunges into the line, 
Maley scored the second touch
down of the season from the one 
foot line. Pappafavas kick Jor 
the extra point was blocked and 
the score was Geneva 13Tech 6. 
Geneva Scores Again
In the second half the Geneva 
team again drew first blood when 
Jim Pietro circled left end for a 
seven yard touchdown sprint 
which ended a 57 yard drive fol
lowing the return of the third 
quarter kick-off to the Geneva 47 
yard line. The attempted conver
sion was again wide and the score 
board read Geneva 19, Carnegie 
Tech 6.
After the Tartans returned the 
Geneva kick-off to their own 19 
yard line, Maley again passed to 
Johnny Williamson for a gain of 
22 yards. Then Maley completed a 
pass to Bob Sommers who fumbled 
the ball when he was tacyled, Ge
neva recovering.
On second down, a Geneva pass 
was completed in the same way 
and the receiver promptly fumbled 
into the hands of a Carnegie man. 
After three unsuccessful plays, 
Larry Maley completed a pass in 
the left flat to Sam Highberger

TUESDAY, OCTOBER 38, 84TTHE CARNEGIE TARTAKt
Creguts Sports Scope
Better Officiating Would Help 
Intramural Touch Football
Now that the intramurals have 
begun on the cut, this might be 
a good time to take a few pot
shots at what appears to us to be 
the weak spots in the set-up.
The first, and most ubiquitous 
is, the refereeing. There has been 
the usual swarm of complaints 
against the fellows who work 
touch-football games and for the 
most part the complaints are well 
founded. But 
just complain
ing is not go
ing to remedy 
the situation.
The question 
most generally 
heard is, Why 
dont they get 
somebody who 
knows some
thing about the 
game to ref
eree? The an
swer to that is, They cant. This 
is unfortunate, but nevertheless 
true. Mr. See has had signs up all 
over the campus advertising the 
need for officials, and it has been 
mentioned in the Tartan, but so 
far very little good seems to have 
been done.
At the present time there are 
not enough men signed up to al
low a representative proportion
ing of the men for the 15 games 
each week. At times it is impossi
ble to have an experienced man 
work with an inexperienced man 
to give the maximum available 
balance. There are so few men 
that if one man cannot make it on 
the day he is scheduled to work, it 
is necessary for one referee to 
handle the whole game.
There appear to be two solu
tions to the problem. The first and 
best is that you fellows who are 
interested in the game and in
terested in seeing that the contests 
are properly officiated get out and 
do some officiating yourselves. 
There is no use of putting the re
sponsibility on somebody elses 
shoulders when in reality it is 
yours. The dollar per game is not 
going to make anybody rich over
night, but it is enough to make 
the hour spent worth while.
The second solution can be used

only if the first does not work. It 
is to have a man from each team 
appointed as an official and then 
have the two men from the com
peting teams work the game. It 
might be said that the men will 
be partial toward their own team 
but this system was used during 
the summer in intramural softball 
and it worked well.
In the final analysis, there can 
be no denying that something 
must be done to remedy the pres
ent situation. Good officiating can 
eliminate half the dirty playing 
that goes on in the games now. 
Two solutions have been offered. 
That they are the panacea for all 
the ills is questionable, but it is 
not questionable that the problem 
should be considered by the intra
mural board and a solution work
ed out.
Our second pot shot is at the 
way the protest rule now operat
ed. Under the present set up, if 
a team protests, they must hand in 
a report within 24 hours and then 
the Intramural board takes the 
report under advisement. If the 
board decides that the protest is 
justified, the game is replayed 
and if not justified, the game 
stands.
The fallacy in this rule is not 
readily discernible. But just im
agine the situation where an of
ficials decision causes a big argu
ment and the ensuing rhubarb 
changes the complexion of the 
game completely, as so often hap
pens. The team protests, but 
eventually goes on to win, and in
stead oif turning in the report with
in twenty-four hours forgets about 
the whole thing. No action is tak
en on the disputed decision and 
the game stands as is. The losing 
team which may have lost as a 
direct result of the protest, is out 
of luck and nothing can be done 
about it.
It is evident from this that the 
protest rule favors the winning 
team. There is a tendency to pro
test anything at all, feeling safe in 
the knowledge that by doing so 
there is everything to gain and 
nothing to lose.
The rule should be stated in 
such a way as to assure the re
view of the intramural board no 
matter what the final outcome of 
the game. This is the system used 
in most of the highly organized 
athletic leagues and it has proved 
itself usable. Under this interpre
tation, the referee and both teams 
should turn in their versions of the 
controversy and a ruling on the 
protest made. Then no matter who 
is the winner, if the claim is jus
tified the game is replayed and 
the argument connected with the 
protest does not have any bearing 
on the final outcome.

Groomes Out Of Lineup 
Because Of Leg Injury
Acting Captain of Wesleyan Came Expected 
To Be Fit to Return in Time For W&J Fight
So they didnt sell score cards, you sat on the newspaper you 
bought, and you want to know the name of the player who backed 
the Carnegie line so well during the Wesleyan game. That man was 
old number 11, C. B. Groomes himself, for Carnegies Mr. Ci 
ter played his typical standout defensive game. ^
Groomes first entered Carnegie in 1942 and played second-str& 
center, seeing a lot of action in his freshman year. Previous to 1 
entrance here, C. B. played three years at fullback for his honr. 
town high school team. He then left Springdale, Pa. to attend Kisi i 
Prep. While playing there he was converted to center, a position he 
has played ever since.
After the 1942 season Groomes left school for the duration. He 
enlisted in the Army Air corps, and soon after turned up in the 
European threatre as a navigator on a B-17. He was discharged as

Sigma Nu, Tau Delta Phi, Theta Xi, And Citcom 
Display Power In Winning Early-Season Contests
Intramural football got off to 
a good start in the first week of 
play. The overall picture shows 
that Sigma Nu, Tau Delta Phi, 
Theta Xi, and Citcom will be the 
teams to beat with the Federal 
League appearing to be the 
strongest.
Sigma Nu and Tau Delta Phi, 
both in the Federal League, are 
tied for the lead with 2 wins and 
no losses each. All indications 
point to the meeting of these two 
teams as the game of the year. 
SN Beats Married Vets
Sigma Nu opened their current 
season on Wednesday by beating 
the Married Vets, 32 to 8. Six 
Sigma Nu players divided scoring 
honors. Voytik passed to Sant for 
their first touchdown and Heidenreich passed to Tikey for the sec
ond score. Katselas ran over the 
goal for the third tally before 
Heidenreich intercepted a Vet pass 
for the fourth. Schnitgen recov
ered a fumble in the end zone 
to complete the days scoring.
Sigma Nu made seven first 
downs to three for the Vets. The 
Vets touchdown resulted from 
a pass from Wars to Blewit.
SN Defeats DTD
Friday found Sigma Nu defeat
ing Delta Tau Delta by a score of 
27 to 12. Heidenreich tossed three 
touchdown aerials to Katselas, 
Thorpe, and Stock for the victors. 
Katselas also tallied on a sweep 
around right end, while the fifth 
tally came as a result of Tikeys 
interception of a Delt pass. Both 
the losers scores came on passes, 
Bob Johnson throwing to Jay 
Johnson for the first tally and 
Zuerner hitting Fredericks for 
the second.
The Cohen-to-Stein passing 
combination dominated the Tau 
Delt victory over SAE on Tues

In this game Stein caught three

more. The final score was 24 to 0.
Theta Xi of the National League 
opened with the most decisive 
game of the week by whipping Pi 
Kappa Alpha 31 to 0 on Monday. 
It is interesting to note that four 
of the tallies were made on end 
runs while only one was made on 
a pass. The biggest feature of 
touch football games is usually 
the passing attack.
Four players contributed to the 
scoring with Nels Greene, Ray 
Borowski, Bill Bellows, and Elmer 
Kaelin doing the running. Kaelin 
caught the pass for the other 
TD.

Alpha Tau Omega was closer but 
TX emerged the winner on the 
long end of a 16 to 6 score. Frank 
Lee blocked an ATO kick for the 
first score. Nels Greene passed 
to Bill Fields for the second and 
ran for the last. ATOs lone score 
came on a pass from Schier to 
Hammann. This was a particularly 
rough game with poor officiating 
not helping very much.
Citcom Has Two Wins
Citcom, in the American League, 
also has a record of two wins and 
no losses. Glunt passed to Muckey 
for the only touchdown in Mon
days game against Delta Upsilon. 
Four Citcom first downs made the 
final score 9 to 2 in their favor.
Friday, Citcom allowed their 
opponents only 2 points again, de
feating Beta Theta Pi 15 to 2.
There were several other games 
during the week. On Monday Del
ta Tau Delta edged Emanon 8 to 
7. Kappa Sigma beat FPHA 15 to 
9 Tuesday with Budden and Lud
wig doing the scoring for KS, and 
Fields catching a pass for FPHAs 
tally.
The Beta Sigma Rho-Phi Kappa 
and Alpha Tau Omega-Graduate 
Physicists games were cancelled 
because the girls hockey teams 
were using the field. The game on 
Wednesday was also cancelled for 
the same reason.
The Dorm Combine won over 
Beta Theta Pi 6 to 4 on Wednes
day with Young catching a pass 
for the lone touchdown. FPHA 
went down to defeat again on 
Thursday, this time to Delta Up
silon, 18 to 6. FPHAs Boyd pass
ed to Fields for their marker 
while DU had Brest and Barr run
ning and Brest passing to Kock for 
their three touchodwns.
Pi Kappa Alpha edged by Beta 
Sigma Rho 13 to 12 in the closest 
game. Heiles to Foster and Cassler to Johnson were the touchdown 
combinations for the PiKAs while 
Corwin passed twice to Levi for 
BSP. PiKAs three first downs to 
Beta Sigs two decided the game.

At the age of 24, C. B. is now 
a first semester junior in the me
chanical engineering department. 
During the past few semesters he 
has also found time to become 
president of the Varsity club, foot
ball representative on the athletic 
board, and also an active member 
of Kappa Sigma fraternity. Be
tween sessions of practising on the
C. B. Groomes
trumpet and hitting the books, he 
usually finds time to enter into 
intramural sports with the fra
ternity.
It is easy to recognize Groomes 
on campus, for he is one of Car
negies best dressed men. Last 
year he was one of the candidates 
for the King of Hearts. You 
girls can keep calm because he is 
already pinned to Dottie Berg, a

Number 11 was among the miss
ing at Forbes field last Saturday 
because of a knee injury. He was

during practice last week. Coach 
Bill Donahue believes it is better 
to lose a player for one game than 
to take the chance of losing him 
for the entire season. Groomes 
will be back in uniform for the

chances for victory will thereby 
receive a boost.

One of the Boys
When the Tartan staff members cast a unanimous vote naming 
Dick Drisko as the most interesting male character on campus, they 
probably knew only part of the story.
They, like other bridge-playing and coffee-drinking inhabitants 
of Skibo, know him best for his untamable blond hair, his chewedoff pipes, and his inspired conversation.
True, at 8:29 of a morning, swallowing a doughnut and fighting 
off that 8:30, he is just another en-41 
gineer who doesnt believe in
mornings. But later, over more 
coffee, he gets in his best phrases 
and most fantastic figures upholdng the other side of any arguent. -
Early risers in the dorms will
Dick Drisko
recall Dick as Phineas P. Fodripple who brought them a Fact For 
the Day on WCITs Clambake. 
One of his more useful disclosures 
was, Fifty percent of all doors 
have their knobs on the left hand 
side.
Less well-known facts about 
Dick include a record IQ well 
down in the moron range, which 
makes him proud of even minor 
accomplishments. But the fact is, 
as a test-weary youth he soon 
learned that the interesting prob
lems came at the end of the tests, 
and he therefore worked back
wards.
He is now feeding a lucky group
of rats the new brain food, glu
tamic acid. If the experiment is 
successful he may be able to dose 
himself up to the dull-normal 
level.
Without chemical help Dick 
maintained A grades in high 
school and was faced with a 
choice between a Cal Tech and a 
George Westinghouse scholarship 
when he graduated. After one 
semester herehe got the only 
4.00 in his classhe spent about 
three years in the Army, seeing 
both the ETO and the Philippines. 
Graduate Work
After returning he waited until 
his sophomore year before taking 
his first graduate course, in math
ematics. He is still discovering 
applications of Abstract Hilbert 
Space in more elementary work. 
At the same time he is taking 
Elements of Electrical Engineer
ing in which he unquestionably 
became the first student to use 
tensors.
Attracted to Math
Of late Dick has become disen
chanted with engineering. As his 
attempt to change to applied 
mathematics failed to receive the 
blessing of Westinghouse, he is 
now taking as close to a double 
schedule as. he can.
Two diversions take up Dicks 
time and money. The first is 
psychiatry, on which subject he 
has a number of juicy books. The 
second is a prewar PontiacFor 
Saleowned in partnership with 
Ed von Halle. His frequent week
end trips to New York quite 
probably have something to do 
with his neglect of the local 
women.
Dick has still another talent 
which he has been forced to neg
lect at Carnegie. He played phe
nomenal clarinet as a high school 
student and was a member of the
Scimitars Meet 
To Elect Officers
Barry Rowles, of Delta Tau Del
ta, was elected president of Scim
itar, sophomore mens honorary 
society, at the organizational meet
ing held last week. Ames Penfield 
will be vice-president for the com
ing year, Bill Knightly, secre
tary, and Ernie Brown, treasurer.
The traditions examinations, 
currently being taken by fresh
men, are given under the super
vision of Scimitar and Cwens. All 
freshmen who fail to pass the 
test or neglect to attend are auto
matically barred from all extra
curricular activities until the re
straint is nullified by a re-ex
amination.
Oklahoma City Symphony; for 
one season he was also personnel 
manager. And while he was in 
the Army he appeared as soloist 
with the Manila symphony, play
ing a difficult modern work.
Last summer Dick moved from 
the boisterous turmoil of the 
FPHA to the sedate corridors of 
Welch Hall, where he lives now. 
All of us on the Tartan devoutly 
hope that the luxurious way of 
living at Welch will not cause 
Dick in any way to modify his intriguing unconventionality or 
adopt the bourgeois manner of his 
surroundings.
Propose Exchange
[Continued from page 2] 
the proposal, and each contributed 
a further development or modifi
cation of his own to the pool of 
ideas.
This whole idea of interfra
ternity cooperation explained 
Bickerstaff, must have gained a 
good bit of ground during recent 
weeks as a result of the PiKA in
vitation to the presidents and vicepresidents of the other fraterni
ties to join them for their pre
opening game luncheon.
Covering his plan in further de
tail, he pointed out that as these 
visits progressed, the same five 
men would not always represent 
an organization. The privilege of 
the invitations would be rotated 
among all of the men in order that 
the maximum number of people 
derive some benefit from the ex
changes, and to make the visitors 
for a given evening more repre
sentative of their fraternity. 
Without Precedent
When asked about the history 
of such visits, Bickerstaff replied 
that if there was some, he hadnt 
heard of it.
The only time this was done 
on any real scale was when a 
group might be asked over to a 
neighboring house for a small beer 
party, or the presidents and vicepresidents would be invited to a 
formal dance.
But on November 7, Sigma 
Alpha Epsilon will join Beta 
Theta Pi for dinner at the Beta 
house, with both fraternities then 
calling for their dates and moving 
over to the SAE house for a 
dance.
This will be the first move in 
the new interfraternal program, 
the first action of this kind in the 
schools history.
The exchange visits of pledges 
will, characteristically, be of a 
somewhat different order, with the 
new men being permitted to get 
together, two classes at a time in 
a single house, and to prepare a 
dance to be attended by the 
pledges and actives of both fra
ternities.
You see, said Bickerstaff, the 
pledgesor most of themwill be 
the leaders, the organizers of the 
fraternities two or three years 
from now.
Elimination of Trouble
If most of them know each 
other then, we shouldnt have the 
trouble which were having now, 
with most of us being just barely 
acquainted with the other mem
bers of the Interfraternity coun
cil.
The ideas introduced at this 
meeting were relayed by the coun
cil members to their fraternity 
meetings on Monday night. Final 
approval of the proposal by the 
component organization is expect
ed at the next meeting of the 
council.

Commandant Of ROTC Unit
Colonel Harold A. Kurstedt, 
Corps of Engineers, is the new 
professor of military science and 
tactics at CIT. His appointment, 
announced today by President Do
herty, will take effect October 1. 
The new professor will relieve 
Colonel Paul J. Dowling who has 
been transferred to his home to 
await retirement.
Colonel Kurstedt, a native of 
Pittsburgh, is a graduate of West 
Point, class of 1927. He attended 
the Army Engineer school in Ft. 
Belvoir, Virginia, and in 1930 re
ceived his degree in Civil Engi
neering from Cornell.
Shortly after Pearl Harbor he 
was sent to England where he set 
up techniques for airfield con
struction and maintenance. While 
overseas he became commander 
of the 817th Engineer Aviation 
battalion. In this capacity he su
pervised the construction of air

final constitution was approved 
unanimously. The result of their 
work was the National Student 
Association.

CUTE SAYINGS 
of KIDDIES
(age 16 to 19 plus)
GET FUNNY... WIN MONEY... WRITE A TITLE
99
This is easier than taking candy away from a baby. And less squawking. 
Maybe you dont want to be rich, but just force yourself. Youll like it. 
And, if we like the title you write for this cartoon well force ourself to give 
you $5. Or if you send us your own cartoon idea well up it to $10. For a 
cartoon that you draw yourself, well float a loan and send you $15 if we 
print it. Could you expect any more? Yes, you coulAexpect.
A famous sage has said that people are 
funnier than anybody. If that were true, 
all youd have to do would be listen to 
what the kiddies are saying, write it down, 
end it in, and wed buy it. If that were 
true. It might be, for all we know. We 
havent the slightest idea what well ac
cept. Chances are it would be things like 
these unless we get some sense.

THE OARNSlE TARTANUESBY, OCTOBER 28, 1947
L.ouncil To Investigate Sources 
Of Additional Funds for WCIT
[Continued from page 1] 
made it evident that he had come 
to the meeting prepared to do his 
best to ensure that WCIT re
ceive a substantially larger sum 
than the $500 which its sixth at
tempt at a budget allowed.
It seems to me, he said, that 
most organizations on campus are 
growing stagnant and are still 
'tting enormous appropriations 
m Student Council, 
lut WCIT, still a growing orsation, is getting only $500. 
//CITs station manager, Eph 
injiamson, attending the meeting 
to answer questions on his bud
get, was introduced to Council 
and explained the station plans 
for expansion.
He revealed that WCIT will 
shortly become a feeder station 
! the Intercollegiate Broadcastg system and that programs origiting on this campus will be 
_>ed out to a national network 
of 20 college stations.
Abramson stressed the fact that 
the station needs money imme
diately in order to provide equipnent to improve the technical 
quality of these national broad
casts so that the college can be 
proud of the voice of Carnegie 
Tech.
Funds Are Too Limited
resident Marshall, expressing 
sentiments of the Council on 
uie WCIT budget, replied, we 
would like to back WCIT to the 
limit, but our funds are too lim
ited.
Further discussion on means of 
obtaining more funds for WCIT 
was ended with the approval of 
the organizations present budget 
and the appointment of David 
Mintz to investigate possible 
sources of further funds which 
would enable Student Council to 
grant WCIT an additional appro
priation.

leaders, and with Mr. Overend, 
who admitted that he did.
Mr. Overend promised Larsen 
that he would keep a closer watch j 
on the cheerleaders in the future. j
The Council was curious to i 
know more about cheerleaders! 
and their performance, and thus 
decided to invite Scotty Yurchison 
to attend their next meeting so 
that the entire problem could be 
discussed and possible remedies 
found.
Of the 18 new members of Stu
dent Council to be elected, three 
will come from Margaret Morri
son, four from Fine Arts, and the 
remainder from Engineering.
There are now too many Mar
garet Morrison and Arts students 
on the Council, said Robert Sha
piro, Elections committee chair
man.
When asked where this surplus 
had come from, he replied, There 
was some slip up, and I dont 
know what happened, but it hap
pened.
Technical Roasted by Reed
Sharpest discussion of the day 
was produced with the introduc
tion of the Technical budget.
Said Negley Reed bluntly: I 
question the thinking that went 
into it.
He pointed out that receipts 
from local advertising were $400 
short of the amount expected, and 
that the printing, engraving, and 
postage budgets had all been sub
stantially exceeded, the former 
by $1600.
Perloff Replies
The Teehnicals business man
ager, Milton Perloff, was intro
duced to the Council, and ex
plained that the first issue of last 
year had resulted in the wiping 
out of a $3000 surplus which the 
magazine had accumulated over a 
period of years. Subsequent issues 
succeeding in recouping some 
$700 of this loss.
This issue had been put out to 
commemorate the tenth annivers
ary of the Carnegie Technical, and 
for the value which it would have 
as publicity for the school.
Reed appeared satisfied with 
this explanation, but asked that,
. . some check on organiza
tions like the Technical be kept 
so that Student Council will not 
have to go $3000 into the hole be
cause of one organization.
He attempted to have passed a 
motion which would provide a 
rigid check on publications which 
exceed their burget, but the mo
tion was defeated after Art Nay* 
lor explained that Dean Dickinson 
had requested that all of the pub
lications keep a complete and ac
curate set of books this year. 
Kilties Will Make 2 Trips 
Nine more organization budgets 
were approved, during which ac
tions the Council discovered that 
the Kiltie Band would be able to 
make two out-of-town trips this 
year, and that at its present rate 
of loss, Cano would be able to 
continue for 28 years on the basis 
of their original appropriation.
King of Hearts was the last ma
jor issue to appear before the 
meeting, with Jack Seward want
ing to know why there was a 
movement to reinstate the Ball 
since this event had been left off 
the social calendar.
David Mintz, speaking for 
Scimitar, said that his organiza
tion had tabled the matter until 
campus sentiment regarding thd 
event could be ascertained. 
Fraternities Anti-Monarchy
Replied Seward: It was left off 
because the fraternities expressed 
a definite feeling against it. 
Mintz responded that the event 
would be entirely different this 
year. The fraternities would be
limited to a small campaign bud
get and wider off-campus pub
licity would be attempted.
Sandwiching smaller bits of 
business between its major issues, 
Council passed the summer min
utes, awarded Lester Engle a goldjeweled key for his work as editor 
of the Student Handbook, and 
was told that Edward Colaianni, 
student manager of the Glee club, 
wanted custom-designed keys for 
his organization.
Council replied that it would 
see Mr. Colaiainni at its next 
meeting and talk to him about his 
request.
Permission was granted Kappa 
Sigma fraternity to change the 
night of its off-campus dance from 
November 22 to January 24.

Carnegie Inn Can Hold 
200 More For Lunch
Miss White at Work
Fully 200 more students can be 
comfortably accomodated by the 
Carnegie Inn during lunch time, 
stated Miss Inez White, school die
tician, in a recent interview.
The Inn is now fully staffed, 
but we cant induce enough stu 
dents to eat there, she stated. 
In the meantime Skibo, now only 
65 percent staffed, is crowded with
long lines every noontime.
Skibo is working for the stu
dents, explained Miss White. It is 
trying to give them the most for 
the least.
But we are still having trouble 
with a number of sharp com
plaints. Take the prices, for ex
ample.
OPA went out in the spring of 
last year and prices in Skibo didnt 
rise until September. Food costs 
have risen continually since 1941, 
until they have now doubled. Our 
prices to the students, however, 
have not risen nearly as much. 
The dietician explained the dif
ficulties in hiring competent peo
ple for the staffthey just arent 
availableand complimented her 
present workers by noting that 
they were making up for the de 
ficiency by working as hard as 
possible.
You see, she explained, Ive 
been a school dietician for some 
time now. I worked for five years 
at the University of Nebraska and 
enjoyed all of it. When the chance 
came to transfer to CIT, I took 
it in preference to working on the 
outside.
I like working with students, 
and I try to serve them well. But 
I guess that there will always be 
some disputes.
You see, when people are un
happy, they usually take it out 
on the food. And since we cant 
do quite as well as a private home 
or a fraternity house, that means 
us.

who went 42 yards for a touch
down. The kick was no good and 
Geneva was leading the Tartans 
by only 19 to 12.
In the fourth period, due to 
some weak ends, a poor pass de
fense, and some bad breaks the 
Covenanters scored three more 
touchdowns and the final score 
read: Geneva 40, Carnegie Tech 
12. It was an expensive victory 
for the Covies however, as four 
first string backfield men were in
jured in the game due to the fierce 
defensive work of the 34 point 
underdog Tartan team. The abil
ity of the Carnegie men to score 
twice on the highly touted Geneva 
eleven shows that the Skibos are 
going to be a threat to every op
ponent they meet this fall. Some
thing should also be said about 
the fine defensive work of the 
Carnegie guards and tackles all 
afternoon.
Next week the Tartans meet 
the Presidents of Washington & 
Jefferson College at Washington, 
Pa. This game should be a real 
thriller because the team is anxi
ous to make up for the 48 to 0 
beating they took at Forbes field 
last year. Jerry Helland and C.
B. Groomes will be back in uni
form and both boys are expected 
to aid the Plaid cause consider
ably.
Professor Shear 
Made Honorary 
Member of Scarab
Professor John Knox Shear, as
sistant head of the department of 
architecture, was initiated as an 
honorary member of Scarab, na
tional architectural honorary, at 
a recent meeting held in his honor 
at the Pittsburgh Architectural 
club on Charette way.
The plaque presented to Profes

expressed the gratitude of that or
ganization for his contributions 
to architectural education.
Professor Shear received his 
bachelor of architecture degree at 
CIT in 1938. He went on to Prince
ton for his M. F. A. in 1940 and 
completed work later that year 
here at Carnegie for his master 
of architecture degree. He taught 
three semesters of Architectural 
Design in the Carnegie depart
ment of architecture and then re
ceived a commission in the Navy 
in 1943.
Upon separation he returned as 
a design critic and continued in 
that capacity until the fall of

Editorial
Council Plans Varied Activities
Classes are definitely in full swing by this time, your second 
week of school. You have endured registration (we believe it should 
have been held weeks ago) to find yourself in the midst of over 
a thousand other students trying to acclimate yourself to another 
year at Carnegie Tech.
To former students, we say Glad to see you back. Your presence 
on campus indicates a sort of faith inthe traditions connected with 
Tech. The high scholastic stand?- 
ing maintained here, the friendly 
spirit displayed by all on campus 
we believe these are some of 
the come-ons which induce eve
ning students to return year after 
year.
We are glad to see the new stu
dents as they embark upon a new 
experience in their lives. To these 
new students, we say Have pa
tience. It takes a little of that to 
get into the swing of evening 
classes. In a few more weeks, you 
will have that feeling of belong
ingeven after completing that 
physics assignment or theme. It 
takes only time for the new fellow 
to adjust himself to the grind 
he has chosen for himself.
While were on the subject of 
adjustment to evening student life, 
there seems no better oportunity 
to mention some of the activities 
Council has planned for you. In 
another spot on this page, you will 
read about the dance. It will be 
a good one, as all of our dances 
have been. Why dont you decide 
right here and now to attend.
To the women attending class
es, we mention Phi Gamma Pi, 
the organization for the women 
enrolled in evening classes. New 
members will be solicited for this 
organization within the next few
Evening Students 
Advised To Stop 
Illegal Parking
As a note of precaution to even
ing students it has been pointed 
out that many of the parking reg
ulations on campus are being con
sistently violated .
Violations occurring most fre
quently are parking on the wrong 
side of Margaret Morrison street; 
parking too close to the driveway 
of Margaret Morrison college; 
parking in front of the adminis
tration building and parking in 
the faculty parking lot immedi
ately adjacent to machinery hall.
The last mentioned regulation 
has been brought about by the 
addition of several army-tstyle 
buildings on the campus.
Illegal parking is a definite haz
ard to life, limb, and body. Those 
who do not obey will payin one 
way or another!
months. Why not consider mem
bership in this organization.
Your PLAID is in need of as
piring writers, and material for 
this pageyour newspaper. We 
will endeavor to supply you with 
news and views concerning your 
evening schol, but we need your 
help. Why not contribute to. the 
PLAID by dropping a note to us 
through the -inter-school mail, 
Box 256. We will welcome your 
comments, good, bad or otherwise.
There is much offered to the 
student, much to be gained by the 
student. It is his choice to make. 
We hope his choice will be to give 
it his best; Techs best will come 
back to him.
PGP Begins Year 
With Fall Meeting
Signing Of Constitution 
Is Main Item Of Agenda
Phi G Pi, the organization for 
women evening students, started 
its second year of existence with 
its fall meeting Sunday, October 
19, in the Carnegie Union.
The signing of the constitution 
was the main item on the agenda 
for this meeting. With threefourths of the active membership 
present, the constitution was duly 
signed and ratified.
One of the main issues dis
cussed in connection with the con
stitution was active membership. 
It was decided that members will 
be carried on the active member
ship list for one year after they 
discontinue classes; and following 
this period, they will be trans
ferred to the inactive list.
After election of officers, the 
presidency of PGP was turned 
over to Elsie Capelli, business 
English student. Elizabeth Lang, 
accounting student, took over the 
duties of vice president; while 
Vivian Behm, American literature 
student, assumed the secretarial 
duties. The funds of Phi Gamma 
Pi have been assigned to Ethel 
Witzel. English composition stu
dent, as the new treasurer.
Retiring officers include Cecille 
Zellner, president; Betty Ash
craft, vice president; Elsie Ca
pelli, secretary, and Barbara 
Davis, treasurer.
Well, friends, here we are again, 
back at the old grind and bursting 
forth with the latest news.
First of all, we will let you in 
on those students that took the 
Fatal Step: Viola Lentz, formerly 
of General Studies, was married 
this past summer; Peg Pangrace, 
a former psychology student, is 
now Mrs. David Holmes, who, by 
the way, is a part-time instructor 
here on campus; and last, but not 
least, is our dear little ex-Editor, 
Betty Ashcraft. Betty is now Mrs. 
Ray Bellsley. They were mar
ried on the 20th of October and 
now reside in Jackson Heights, a 
suburb of New York City. One 
more important note is that all of 
these girls belong to our one and 
only sorority, PHI GAMMA PI

Prohibitionists Attacked By 
Evening School Liquor Liberal
By William Wallace
Do you think this is going to 
be a dry discourse? Stay with 
us . . . its anent the stealthy 
movement afoot to bring a rea
sonable facsimile of the beloved 
Volstead Act back to the harassed, 
gullible, long suffering American 
public. This is taking the form 
of nation-wide local options; for 
it would seem rather childish to 
try to amend the constitution 
again on the same score, and that 
alone would give the drive a 
foolish appearance. But the ap
parent aim of Prohibitionists 
seems to be to reach out into 
every nook and close the taps one 
by one.
We wonder at those who would 
force their moral scruples on us.

books leave us cold when we read 
them in adult years. Those little 
bundles of dos, donts, and fears 
would make ideal starters for the 
new-type coal. It would be in
teresting to see what lies in the 
back of the mind of an ardent 
Prohibitionist. What under sur
face disappointments, frustration, 
or neglects could cause one to 
want to wipe alcohol from the face 
of the earth? But those birds 
wouldnt even appreciate free 
drinks in order to test the effi
cacy of a little alcohol on certain 
occasions. They would probably 
be thinking about the so-called 
harmful effects on their brains, 
stomachs, kidneys, and other parts 
of the human anatomy.
Anyone who has ever observed 
a social gathering before and after 
alcohol, marvels at the ease and 
relaxation which comes over the 
crowd. If that is evil in the eyes of 
a Prohibitionist, then heres suds 
to it!
Its always been our deep re
gret that no beer may be served 
at Carnegie Techs parties. 
Whether this ruling stems from 
fear of drunkeness or plain 
squeamishness, we can only guess, 
but if bets were possible, wed 
put our last sixty-cent buck on

Ed Schaughency of KDKA has 
this to say about Tiny Wolfe: 
PITTSBURGH, PA.One of the 
great new bands to come out of 
nowhere and cause a sensation in 
the Pittsburgh District is the out
fit being conducted by TINY 
WOLFE who just a little while 
ago had gained fame and fortune 
for himself and his 380 pounds 
as a leading lisrht with the BLUE 
BARRON ORCHESTRA.
TINY as he is known to and his 
fans and friends in the Pittsburgh 
district has been a sensation 
wherever he has played. He is 
noted for hi$ own little floor show, 
and his sweet musicknown as 
the MUSIC WITH A SMILE.

Peron a baker, filibustering re
volutionary ... Although my 
native language is not English, I 
would like to suggest to Carl 
Klahr that he look up in the dic
tionary the correct meaning of the 
words before using them. By this 
I do not intend to question his in
telligence or writing abilities.
Mr. Editor, your feature writer 
should study better the actions 
of the State Department, and see 
what they are driving at. Now that 
there exists a Communist danger, 
it is better to cooperate with all of 
those countries which are effec
tively reducing this menace.
Sincerely yours,
MARIO VARESE-DONADA, 
Senior Printing Dept.
ODK Elects
t Continued from page 1]
of Student Council, of which he 
is a member.

were reviewed during this meet
ing. ODK will interview prospec

make the final selection next 
week.
Says Who?
[Continued from page 2] 
many other people in the United 
States and the rest of the world.
To facilitate this story, Ben be
came president of the railroad ten 
years later. (He had collected all 
the proxy votes while the board 
of directors was out to lunch and 
elected himself.) At last Benny, 
by this time an untiring dynamo 
of energy, was ready to get his re
venge. His eyes flashed; he rub
bed his hands together, picked up 
the phone and dialed his Eighth 
avenue employment manager, Old 
Man Morgan. Youre at my mer
cy, Morgan. I can fire you and 
blacklist you, make it impossible 
for you to ever have a decent 
job again. Suddenly Morgan be
gan to cuss uncontrollably at a 
passing vagrant and Benny was 
sickened by a cold, logical thought. 
If I fire him, thought Benny, 
he will become as idle happy as I 
once was. He will lean back all day 
against the Eighth avenue el while 
I sweat and squirm in this office.
You keep right on working, 
Morgan, he said.
