President For Spring Term
Business of Semester Discussed 
As New Councilmen Meet For First Time
By Dick Christensen
Shirlee Ploeger, a senior majoring in general science, was elected 
new president of Student Council to succeed Justin Davidson at the 
joint meeting of the old and new Councils last Wednesday. She 
defeated Ronnie Curhan by a vote of 17-15.
Shirlee is the oldest, in point of4----------------------------------------------------
length of service, member of SC, 
now beginning her fourth con
secutive semester in office. In this 
time she has distinguished herself 
by very capable work, serving as 
chairman of the class organizations 
and the publications committees. 
Shirlee has also been prominent in 
other campus activities including

the Tartan, Cwens, Mortar Board, 
and the Debating Society.
Surprise Resolution 
Larry Glavin surprised SC by 
introducing a strongly - worded 
resolution calling for Council to 
register its disapproval of the ac
tion of the executive committee in 
declaring two second-semester 
freshmen ineligible for the recent 
Council elections. Although the 
resolution was defeated 16-10, 
prior discussion brought out the 
fact that two of the five members
nouncing their action in suspend
ing Scotch n Sodas constitution. 
The letter charged that S n S had 
not submitted a list of their mem
bers as specified in the freshman 
regulations ruling because there 
were no freshmen in the organiza
tion and demanded a clarifying 
statement in the Tartan. Bob 
Byrne, however, reminded Council 
that all organizations under their 
jurisdiction were required to sub
mit a list of their members 
whether or not there were fresh
men in the activity. He went* on 
to say that S n S had complied 
with the ruling, and thus gained 
reinstatement of their constitu
tion, only after the article on the 
constitution suspension had ap
peared in the Tartan.
Petition Disappears
Justin Davidson, retiring SC 
president, answered Joe Pecenkas 
charge, printed in the last issue of 
the Tartan, that his petition to dis
solve Council was not being acted 
upon. Davidson stated that the 
petition was not presented either 
to him or to Council, as specified 
in the constitution.
This was the last meeting in 
which the old members of SC par
ticipated and final reports from 
committee chairmen were given.

The Scot, Carnegie Techs outlet

will present the first parody issue 
in its long and chequered career 
on Tuesday, February 26. Mas

Good Housebreaking, the maga

tions discussed their existing prob
lems in an effort to find solutions 
that would lead to more efficient 
and well organized staffs as 
as more interesting and 
publications.
Discussion groups were divided 
as follows: editors, business mana
gers, advertising managers, 
feature writers. All groups 
to the one definite conclusion that 
permanent committees should be 
set up among the publications. 
These committees could exchange 
ideas and would make a stronger 
and more united force of publica
tions than exists now.
Personnel, Policing, Policies
Editorial discussion involved 
such problems s personnel, polic
ing by administration, and gen
eral policies. It was decided that 
personnel staffs should be trained 
and made familiar with all de
partments of the publications and 
that promising freshmen be train
ed each year for staff positions. 
The members further decided that 
publication heads were mature 
enough to do their own policing 
without control from Council or 
the administration. It was felt that 
the present publications, policies 
needed to be rehabilitated. A def
inite policy is needed regarding 
student activities to help erase

of placements at Carnegie Tech.
He added that the demand for 
engineers is increasing while the 
supply is decreasing, and that he 
expected to hear from at least 700 
companies in regard to job op
portunities this year. Along with 
the demand for engineers, salar
ies have also gone up. He predict
ed an increase of seven to 10 per 
cent this year over the starting 
salaries of last Junes graduates.
The companies that contact Car
negie Tech students represent a 
cross section from all over the 
United States, including large corj porations as well as small firms, 
i Mr. Wangeman added that All

The Plot
The play deals with the efforts 
of a strong-willed English woman 
to bring education to a small vil
lage in Wales. The dreadful work
ing conditions of the last half of 
the 19th century prevented her 
from accomplishing her job easily. 
Her main problems are to over
come ignorance, superstition, and 
poverty, and the resentment of a 
stupid, but powerful squire.
an underprivileged mining boy 
gives her inspiration and an in
sight into the problem, which she 
sets out to solve by educating the 
townspeople.
Authors Fame Widespread 
Emlyn Williams is famous in the 
literary world for products other 
than The Corn is Green. Having 
completed a successful series of 
Dickens readings in the British 
Isles, Williams is coming to the 
United States to present them. 
His readings of Pickwick Papers, 
David Copperfield and other Dick
ens novels are filled with the 
pathos and understanding of the 
original author.

I enjoyed the

Century. I might have had worse 
bed fellows than: Dante, Bacon 
and Francis of Assisi. But to the 
core! Interested Reader has as
sumed either by intent or by care
less perusal of my column that I 
have set Religion into conflict with 
Science. An eyeful oversight! I 
would cry out against the spiritual 
barren of science as I have cried 
out against science barren of the 
spiritual. Mr. Interested Reader 
is back in the age of William Jenn i n g s Bryans fundamentalist 
Protestantism! The hope of human 
kind is, I feel, a unitary being; not 
religion or sciencerather religion 
through science; science through 
religion.'My article The God That 
Failed was a resume of how we 
have come to where we are, and 
my conception of our arrivals 
failures. My so-called antagonism 
rises not with doubt or skeptic
ism but with action based on the 
negation of the spiritual coupled 
with the scientific.
Is Religion Thriving?
Mr. Interested Reader states 
that brutal dictatorship is not the 
product of atheism. I suggest it is 
whether practiced by men in 
science, government, or religion, 
brutality is atheistic for it negates 
not only God but the God given 
right of the individual. He states 
that greed is the cause of brutal 
dictatorship. Can there not be 
greed in intellectualism? Can 
there not be a form of brutality 
stemming from scientific bigotry? 
Note the organized scientific cam

Mr. Interested Reader states 
that religion is thriving. I take ex
ception to this. Our corruption; 
our decay; our drug addiction; our 
crime; our graft; our neuroses do 
not suggest a nation steeped in 
religionrather one grounded in 
irreligion. Lip service is thriving; 
not spirituality. Statistics of in
creased church attendance may be 
true, but Mr. Interested Reader is 
again a victim of duality in 
thought. Church attendance is as 
empty as independent scientic 
thought without daily moral ac
tion. The business man Amening 
the sermon against greed is not 
living that sermon. His daily life 
is devoted to sustaining, mainman paying homage to the cry of 
Christian Brotherhood is not a

church he returns to his daily life

Change is the basis ot man. It is 
his constant searching for the 
truth, but truth does not change

earth was always round whether 
we admitted it or not. I agree we

and weld them into a basis of ac

This des not mean a change in 
the ultimate truth of the JudoChristian traditiononly the ap
plication of that tradition to our 
times. There is a world order and 
a lasting peace to build. I feel M 
can only be built as the imitation 
of Infinite Love. The means to at
tain that peace and love are not 
importantso long as the basis at 
our actions is love.

Editorials
Big Job
For the first time since the war a female will preside 
over Student Councils searchings after truth. Shirlee 
Ploegers election as president should provide new fuel for 
those who dispute the superiority of men and women (and 
who doesnt!) But on one thing we can agree; theres plenty 
to be done and none of it will be easy.
Retiring Council members leave behind them an average, 
mediocre record. Their most spectacular claim to fame was 
the recent election foul-up which, though typical of the 
sluggishness and inefficiency usually associated with Coun
cil, was unfortunate in that it effected students in an easily 
recognizable manner. But interspersed among the usual 
bickerings over by-laws and technicalities, Council found 
time to (1) promote smaller classes where overcrowding had 
existed previously, (2) sponsor a report on present conditions 
in Skibo as compared to other local beaneries, (3) sponsor 
a successful blood drive, (4) give support to pep rallies and 
freshmen regulations.
On the other hand, the list of projects pending or in
complete is long, and growing longer. Some of the major 
problems facing the new Council will be;
(1) Present housing conditions on campus are spotty. Some dorm 
rooms are overcrowdedbarracks should be replaced soon. 
Problem of fresfimen living in fraternity houses during the 
first semester.
(2) Confusion still exists regarding the social schedule and pro
cedureit should be possible to organize the school calendar 
to avoid conflicts and poor timing of social events.
(3) Class organizations have ceased to function effectively. Either 
drop them entirely or give them enough monetary and per
sonal aid to become important to campus organization.
(4) Pep rallies need considerably more development to make 
them of a real benefit to the students or the teams.
(5) Freshmen regulations need revision if they are to accomplish 
their dual purpose of promoting school spirit and giving 
the freshmen basic knowledge of the school. Enforcement 
needs further tightening.
(6) Reasons for the failure of last years Campus Chest drive 
should be found and the conditions remedied, if possible.
(7) Publicity for Council itself should be considered as a means 
of increasing student interest.
(8) Organizational matters from last semester should be cleared 
up: completely outline necessary election procedures, deal 
with Pecenkas petition, make arrangements for the reduced 
representation due to go into effect soon.
(9) Plan to advance closer cooperation between the different col
leges.
And many more items could be added. If the enthusiasm 
evidenced in the platform letters printed in the Tartan a 
short time ago was sincere, there should be a great many 
diligent and selfless individuals sitting around that table in 
the Union every Wednesday. It will be Shirlee Ploegers 
job to turn the enthusiasm which prompted those letters into 
an enthusiasm for hard, time-consuming work.

In Last Six Seasons
Tartans Show Best Form of Year
As Craig, Beck, Thompson Star
The Carnegie basketeers displayed their finest form of the sea

gym Saturday night. +
The victory was the Tartans
Coming Up
On the sports calendar for 
Carnegie fans this week are 
double-headers in basketball 
and swimming. The swim
ming team, which now owns 
a 4-3 record, ends regular sea
son play with meets against

The basketball team travels

first over W & J in six years and 
ended an eleven game domination 
by the Prexies.
Prexies Take Early Lead
At first it appeared as if the ; 
game would be a duplication of j 
the Presidents previous victory j 
over Carnegie at Washington, Pa., 
where they scored a 67-54 win. 
The Prexies took an early 3-2 lead 
and increased it to 19-15 at the 
end of the initial canto.
In the second period the boys 
from W & J were unable to solve 
the sliding zone defense set up 
against them by the Tartans. In 
the meantime Tom Beck took per
sonal charge of the Plaid offense 
as he hit on six of seven shots 
from the field.
Beck Shines
With Becks shooting keeping 
them in the game, the Skibos went 
ahead at 28-25 when Prexie Web
er fouled Bill Farbacher in the act 
of shooting and received an addi
tional technical for disagreeing 
with the referee. The Tartans 
were never headed from this point 
and ended the half with a 38-32 
halftime advantage.
Holste Fouls Out
Early in the second half the 
Tartans lost the services of Hilary 
Holste as he left the game via the 
whistle route. The Carnegie disad
vantage was offset by the Presi
dents loss of star John Mojzer, 
who committed his last foul after 
accumulating four in me first half.
The Skibos kept the pressure on 
in the second half as they con
tinued to increase their margin. 
At one time they were in front by 
19 points.
Accuracy Good
Accuracy from the field was 
the deciding factor in the Car
negie win as the Tartans had an 
amazing 50% field goal percentage. 
The team hit on 27 of 54 from the 
outside while converting 18 of 34 
from the free throw line.
Tommy Craig was again high 
scorer for the evening as he col
lected 29 points on 11 field goals 
and seven of ten fouls. It brought 
his season total to 308 and an av
erage of 17.1 points per game. Tom 
Beck and Kaye Thompson had 14 
and 10 points respectively.

Four Straight
The win over the Presidents

tans and their longest win streak 
of the year. On Thursday the 
hoopsters had taken the measure

Plaid jumped off to a 24-11 first 
quarter lead and coasted for the 
remainder of the game. Craig was

10-8 record with five games on 
the schedule remaining to be 
played.

Decision To Kent State Team
Carnegie Tech swimmers were edged in a heartbreaking meet, 
45 to 39, by Kent State last Wednesday. As consolation, the Tartans 
marked two new pool records, while the Staters succeeded in bet
tering one of their own previous marks.

Plaid 66-18 Victors 
Over Indiana Mermen
The Tartan tankers coasted to an easy victory on Saturday over 
the State Teachers from Indiana, Pa. All the Teachers were able 
to show during the afternoon was a fighting spirit and a will to win 
as Tech came out with a 66-18 score.
Early in the meet, Coach Sofield#------------------------------------------------------
pulled his stars into drydock. His 
second string swimmers swept the 
remaining events except for the 
final relay and diving where the 
Plaid, hurt by probation, had only 
one entry.
Rod Macdonald scored Carne
gies only double win by pacing 
the individual medley and the 
backstroke. Bill Aiken won the 
breaststroke and swam on the 
winning relay team.
Many Tech second stringers 
showed great promise and consid
erable improvement over the pre
season forecasts. Among the stand
outs were Ted Reuther, who took 
the 220 yd. freestyle, and Chuck 
Gough, who won the 100 yd. free
style.
Till the end of the meet, the only
excitement of the day was pro
vided by Rod Macdonalds two 
wins. In the individual medley he 
came from behind to touch out 
Tom Freeman and again in the 
backstroke he came from behind 
to edge Bob Coulter.
The meet climax, the relay, was 
of great interest since both teams 
were evenly matched. The lead 
seesawed back and forth until In
diana came through on the last 
leg to win.
This is Indianas first full season 
of swimming and they are just 
getting a team under way. They 
showed some promising freshman 
material, who with more condi
tioning and experience should de
velop into the nucleus of a good 
team.

Rapidly Gaining 
Varsity Status
Intramural wrestling is rapidly 
assuming varsity proportions at 
Carnegie, as an informal inter
school schedule has been arranged 
for the grunt and groan athletes. 
The schedule, following the play 
offs of the intramural champion
ship matches in wrestling, which 
were held last Wednesday and 
Thursday, tentative opponents and 
dates is listed below:
Shadyside Academy Feb. 22 
Ind. State Teachers Feb. 27

Allegheny Last HomeIM Playoffs
TI heyre both good basketball 
players. But if we were to 
judge them the way we judge 
telephone equipment, we'd take the 
small one.
You see, telephone equipment occu
pies valuable space, uses costly mate
rials. Paring down its size iielps keep 
down the cost of telephone service.
Take voice amplifiers, for example. 
Telephone engineers put the squeeze
on size, came up with a new small 
type. When 600 of these new ampli
fiers are mounted on a frame two feet 
wide and eleven feet high, they do a 
job which once required a roomful of 
equipment. Size was cut but not 
performance!
This is one of many cases where the 
Bell System has made big things small 
to help keep the cost of telephone 
service low.

Tilt For Holste, Beck
Carnegie hardwood fans who watch the Tartans take the floor 
against the Allegheny Gators this Saturday will be viewing the last 
home performance of two of coach Mel Cratsleys key basketball 
stars. Making their last appearance in Plaid uniform at the Skibo
Gym will be seniors Tommy Beck' 
and Hilary Holste, the Tartans 
playing the last three games of 
their schedule away from home.
Beck, a 5r 11" playmaker, has 
served four years on the Carnegie 
varsity and has been one of the 
most steady and dependable per
formers on the Tartan five. A 
deadly set shot artist and a fine 
ballhandler, Tom has been the 
team players ballplayer. His ac
curate shooting and drive provid
ed the spark for the Skibos first 
win in six years against W & J 
only last Saturday.
Rebound Artist 
Holste, who transferred to the 
Carnegie campus in his sophomore 
year, has been a valuable Tartan 
asset with his work on the back
boards and his one-handed push 
shot. Stretching 6' 4" into the air, 
Hilary has constantly taken more 
than his share of the rebounds for 
the Plaid,
Holste and Beck, along with 
the rest of the Skibos, will face 
one of their toughest tests of the 
season Wednesday, when they 
journey to Pitts new field house
for a return engagement with Doc 
Carlsons Panthers. In their first 
match this year, the Plaid upset 
the heavily favored Panthers 65- 
56. The Pittsters are expected to 
be gunning for revenge, with the 
advantage definitely theirs on the 
home court.
Probable Starters 
In addition to Holste and Beck, 
the probable starting lineup tor 
Carnegie will include Bill Farbacher, Tom Craig, leading the 
scoring parade with 308 points, 
and Kaye Thompson, who has 
been improving upon the position 
left vacant by Bud Kuenzig.

In Better Than Average Season
Led by high scorers Bill Dosey and John Daniels, the Carnegie 
JV basketball team has compiled a .500 record for their hardwood 
play to date. Although the junior Tartans do not sport an im
pressive win-loss slate, the players have gained valuable experience

shoes which will be left vacant by 
the graduating seniors on the var

to have valuable assets in Bill

week with league champions de
termined in all but the Scot league, 
where Tau Delta Phi and Theta 
Xi are tied for the first position. 
In the Kiltie league, ATO A is in 
first position while the Raiders are 
holders of the Skibo league title.
In the all-school playoffs, Alpha 
Tau Omega will meet the Raiders 
and Theta Xi will play the Tau 
Delts in the semi-final round. The 
two winners will play for the cam

Industries Lives On 
--If Only In Memory
By Dick Durstine
Let us dwell a moment on the passing of an old and honored 
landmarka structure that was just as much a part of CIT as any
thing has ever beenIndustries Hall*
True, the lanky building still remains, and is from all appearances 
unchanged. But students return-< 
ing to register last fall noticed on 
their schedule cards the strange, 
cryptic symbol PH, Porter Hall.
IH was dead, a thing of the past, 
sacrificed for the benefit of the 
department of civil engineering.
Another Gift?
Another fact was also evident.
That was the insidious extension 
of Administration Hall down the 
sloping corridors that had been the 
heart of the first permanent build
ing on the Carnegie campus. The 
newly created Porter Hall envel
oped only a small portion of the 
old domain. For the most part, the 
space was absorbed by AH.
Was there a grift from someone 
named Administration?
So between the two, IH is dead, 
mourned by no one,and forgotten 
by all but those who still refer to 
her, from force of habit, as In
dustries.
Viewing the Corpse
In two years the name IH will 
be a ghost of the past, recalled by 
only a handful, sharing the fate 
of the Langley laboratory (now 
Skibo).
Therefore, while the body is yet 
warm, let us take a look at the 
deceased.
Industries Hall housed all of 
Carnegies classes fcom 1905 
(when the building was not yet 
complete) until 1907, when MMCC 
left its confines. The science stu
dents withdrew in 1908, and the 
College of Fine Arts in 1912. So 
IH was the father of the school, 
the birthplace of the entire insti
tution.
The Spirit is Lost
In appearance, she was familiar 
to all, with her one-eighth mile 
corridor and its 4.25 percent grade.
Art Exhibition 
On Murals 
Opens Today
The Case History of a Mural 
Painting, opens today in the 
Hewlitt room on the first floor of 
the College of Fine Arts and con
tinues for two weeks.
The exhibition is a detailed vis
ual narrative of problems involv
ed in the design and execution of 
the mural for the ceiling of the 
concourse of the Airport Terminal 
building at Charleston, West Vir
ginia, by Professor Robert Lepper 
of the department of painting and 
design.
Plans for the building are the 
muralists starting point. Research 
in the development of the theme 
leads to the final design which is 
shown in a three dimensional 
model of the room. Preparatory 
color and paint experiments ap
pear on a full size section of the 
ceiling, which shows the method 
of applying the design to the ceil
ing.
Presented by Tau Sigma Delta, 
honorary professional fraternity in 
architecture and related arts, the 
exhibition is the first of a series 
planned to demonstrate the active 
collaboration of designers in many 
fields.
Administration Hall
.. . insidious extension...
the walls, holding the halls sources 
of illumination.
Whatever her defects have been, 
IH had charm. No one would ac
cuse her of beauty, but there was 
a certain grandeur in the steel 
reinforcements on the pillars, and 
the copper sheathing on the doors 
and windows. But, though these 
remain, the very spirit of the thing 
is lost. Industries Hall, despite 
the fact that the building looks the 
same, has been destroyed.
The Pigeons Live On
Unchanged through it all are 
the pigeons, doubtless the first oc
cupants of the building, and likely 
also to be the last. Anyone ac
quainted with that portion of the 
structure now called Porter Hall 
is familiar with the myriad pigeons 
that flock to its eves to operate, it 
has been said, a disorderly house 
(for pigeons). They remain, but 
would they coo as loudly if they 
knew the truth?
Let us mourn then the passing of 
one more tradition, perhaps the 
oldest of them all. She served us 
long and well, but has finally suc
cumbed to the creeping, cancerous 
growth of progress.

Forms Basis 
For Contest
One of the most controversial 
books in'the past few months is 
William F. Buckleys, God and 
Man at Yale. It has attracted both 
attack and praise from the critics.
Some of the problems on which 
readers cant agree are: Is aca
demic freedom a superstition? 
To what extint? What are the re
sponsibilities of the teacher? Is 
Mr. Buckley correct in suggesting 
that many professors and text
books are advocating a slow but 
relentless transfer of power from 
the individual to the state? In 
the case of the privately endowed 
universities, such as Yale, what 
measures of control should be 
given to the alumni?
Regnery Company Contest
All these questions concern col
lege personnel. The Henry Reg
nery company is interested in con
tinuing and broadcasting the dis
cussion; therefore they are offer
ing $250 for the best essay on each 
side, one in support of the book, 
and the other opposing the book. 
In addition four manuscripts will 
receive honorable mention in the 
public press.
Contest Rules
Here are the contest rules:
1. All essays should be approxi

should deal specifically with one 
or more of the problems regarding 
education in a free society posed 
by God and Man at Yale.
2. The manuscripts should be

ported that the Technical would be

ary 26. She also said that both the 
Scot and the Technical expect to

Ronnie Curhan, in submitting 
his report of the Points and Keys 
Committee, outlined the six point 
program he has been putting into 
action for revision of the pro
cedure for awarding points and 
keys. He also offered a suggestion 
to modernize the organization of 
the committee by eliminating the 
assistant chairman.
Suggests Elimination
Don Abrams proposed that SC 
eliminate the permanent decora
tions committee, which he headed 
last semester, and turn the job en
tirely over to Alpha Phi Omega, 
which does the major share of the 
work as it is.
John Vassil, ex-chairman of the 
important plans and programs 
committee, blamed the failure of 
the pep rally program last fall to 
conflicting social events which cut 
down attendance considerably. He 
suggested that in the future pep 
rallies be planned in the spring 
and wisely distributed through the 
football season. Vassil also rec
ommended that an invitation to 
participate as non-voting members 
of Council be extended to the 
heads of prominent campus or
ganizations as has been done with 
class presidents.
Needs Better Publicity
In conclusion, Vassil stated that 
SC needs lots of publicity, and

Irv Shecter, who took over the 
class organizations committee in 
the middle of last semester, said 
that little was actually accom
plished in the committees aim to 
integrate and promote interest in 
class organizations. For improve
ment in this situation, Shecter ad
vised Council to work out a

give them some capital to work on.
Other Business
When Bruce Padlof moved that 
the results of the recent SC elec
tions be officially accepted, Wes 
Apple raised the question of Joe 
Pacenkas charge that this election 
was also invalid because of inade
quate identification of the voters. 
Davidson replied that, although 
college identification is not on the 
second semester ID cards, all pos
sible safeguards were taken in this 
respect. Council then passed 
Padolfs motion.
George Seitenkes appointment 
as new circulation manager of the 
Technical and Cal Cruders resig

the Scot were accepted.
In other business conducted by

Parking Problem 
Still Existent
Editor, the Plaid:
Even after all the articles which 
appeared in the Plaid concerning 
the parking situation at CIT we 
still have some people who insist 
on taking up enough space for 
three cars, with one. Lets all co
operate and give the fellow who 
has a later class some room to 
park. Remember, we all go to the 
same school and have the same 
right to park in the campus park
ing areas.
Seems that although the IQ rat
ing of Carnegies students is fair
ly high, some people have the in
telligence of an imbecile when it 
comes to parking. Why not brush 
up on this matter as you do your 
other subjects?
Yours truly,

dents and administration arising 
from ignorance as to administra
tions views.
Want Broad Technical
Specifically, it was felt that the 
Tartan should draw up a plan and, 
Without defamation of character, 
make use of constructive criticism 
in its news. The Scot could follow 
this pattern and include with it 
the discussion of controversial sub
ject matter.
An important point was brought 
out concerning the limited reader
ship of the Technical. A coverage 
ot technical subjects in MMCC and 
Fine Arts as well as Engineering 
should be made, and the articles 
should be aimed at the lay read
er and not the specialist alone.
The main discussion under the 
business managers involved ex
cess profits. The subject of salar
ies was brought up but cast aside 
as impractical though good. Pub
lications are too restricted by 
school policy to pay salaries and
buying new typewriters.
Cooperation and Incentives
Discussion on features centered 
on the problems of obtaining fea
ture writers; the type, purpose, 
and control of features appearing 
in the various publications; and 
the seeming lack of student inter! est in features. It was decided that 
I all feature departments could be 
1 improved through a more critical 
j use of the types of features best 
suited for the various publications, 
and that the staff problems might 
be solved by closer cooperation 
with the English department 
and/or various incentives (cash, 
prestige), etc.
Advertising Problem^
Main problems faced by the ad
vertising managers of the publica
tions were felt to bt better meth
ods of obtaining local ads and the 
acquisition of suitable personnel 
to secure the ads. The coordination 
of the efforts of all advertising de
partments, instead of the competi
tion which now exists, was felt to 
offer the best solution to the first 
problem, while better screening of 
freshmen and more job incentives
local advertising is matched dol; would help solve the problems of
