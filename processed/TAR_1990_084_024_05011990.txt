A proposal for an undergraduate college which 
would incorporate disciplines from existing 
colleges may be on its way to realization, pend

tion task force.
According to outgoing Student Government 
President Mark Mittelhauser, the college would 
solve problems like getting a wide breadth of 
education with more cross-disciplinary studies. 
It would also address concerns such as excel
lence in teaching and professors who teach but 
do not participate in outside research.
The concept has been discussed in President

Bailey resigns;

Tartan Assistant News Editor
In a seemingly surprising flurry of events, 
Professor of Economics Dennis Epple became 
Acting Dean of the Graduate School of Indus
trial Administration on Thursday, three days 
after Dean Elizabeth Bailey tendered her resig

may well be following suit and also leave his 
administrative post at GSIA come June 30.
However, current events may not have been a 
surprise to everyone. Although President Rich
ard Cyert has denied it, McGuire said Cyert 
called for Bailey to resign. I am virtually cer
tain that it occurred April 2, he recalled, for it 
was about two weeks later that Provost Angel 
Jordan phoned him, asking for his resignation.
A forced resignation of Bailey is not a surprise 
to the student body, according to second year 
masters student Ed DeForest. At the last

University

Tartan Assistant News Editor
The end of the pilot recycling 
program in Warner Hall has left 
the campus community unsure 
as to the future of a paper recy
cling program on a Universitywide scale.
The program, which placed 250 
recycling containers in Warner 
Hall for the recycling of regular 
ofSce white paper, ran on a trial 
basis from January to March.
According to Jeff Rosenblum, 
recycling coordinator for Carne
gie Mellons Department of Envi
ronmental Health and Safety, the 
program was a good idea and 
worked well, but probably will 
not be implemented on a perma
nent University-wide scale at this 
point because of a need for in
creased levels of funding and 
staffing.

This Pontiac Sunbird caught fire Saturday afternoon just 
outside of Baker Hall. No one was injured in the fire.
A 1979 Pontiac Sunbird was consumed by flames on 
Saturday afternoon on the 4800 block of Frew Street outside 
of Baker Hall. Campus Police report that when the cars 
owner entered the vehicle and attempted to start the engine, 
he noticed smoke coming from under the passenger side of 
the dashboard and the floor. A Pittsburgh parking meter 
collector then entered the Carnegie Mellon Police station at 
Baker Hall 155 to summon help. The Pittsburgh Bureau of 
Fire was notified immediately by the Campus Police officer 
on duty. Campus Police officers used four water and three

Food rationing 
takes effect in 
Lithuania
MOSCOW (AP)  A decision 
by Lithuanian leaders made last 
week to impose food rationing goes 
into effect today, as the rebellious 
republic continues to struggle 
under an economic blockade that 
has reduced its supplies of fuel 
and medicine.
Lithuania widened efforts to 
circumvent sanctions imposed two 
weeks ago by Soviet President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who wants 
Lithuania to rescind laws de
signed to implement its March 11 
declaration of independence.
A Lithuanian delegation was 
due in the northern Russian city 
of Leningrad on Friday to talk 
with local officials about a direct 
exchange of goods either for hard 
currency or barter, a Leningrad 
journalist said.
Prime Minister Kazimiera 
Prunskiene announced yesterday 
that Lithuania had halted its 
usual supplies of meat, milk, and 
other food products to the rest of 
the Soviet Union. She urged 
Lithuania to settle its accounts 
with the republics almost in mar
ketplace conditions of bartering 
for other goods.
Rita Dapkus, a spokeswoman 
for the Lithuanian parliament, or 
Supreme Council, said lawmak
ers decided to ration some food 
products beginning May 1, al
though no details were released.
Unlike most Soviet republics, 
Lithuania produces all the meat 
and dairy goods it needs, so the 
rationing presumably would be of 
those foodstuffs it does not pro
duce, or of meat and milk prod
ucts earmarked for export.
Major unrest 
unlikely, says 
Chinese leader
MOSCOW (AP)  Premier Li 
Peng, on the first visit by a Chi
nese head of government to the 
Soviet Union in 26 years, said 
there will be no repeat of last 
springs pro-democracy demon
strations in China.
However, Li did acknowledge 
minor unrest in the far western 
province of Xinjiang, where Xinji
ang TV reported 22 people were 
killed in rioting between April 5 
and 6. It was the first such admis
sion by the Beijing government of 
the riots, which the regional tele
vision blamed on Moslems trying 
to start a holy war.
In a news conference, Li called 
his visit to Moscow a success 
because both nations agreed to 
reduce military forces along their 
border and continue good-neigh
borly, friendly relations.
Yet in a clue that the two long
time Communist rivals could not 
resolve all their differences, Li 
said there would be no joint com
munique. Such a document is cus
tomary for summit meetings.
Li saidno joint statement would 
be issued because his four-day 
visit was so short and more time 
and effort would be needed to 
work out a communique. He said 
that each sides concluding state
ment would have no radical dif
ferences.
China agreed to provide state 
credits to the Soviet Union to pay 
for import of Chinese consumer 
goods. Li did not specify the goods.
The Soviet Union will provide a 
credit to China to build a nuclear 
power station.
Colombian 
candidate shot 
on board airliner
BOGOTA, Colombia (AP)  A 
former guerrilla leaderwho joined 
the presidential race last month 
was killed April 27 by an assail
ant who opened fire with a ma
chine gun aboard an airliner 
minutes after it left Bogota.
The assailant was killed by the 
candidates bodyguards, police 
said.
The plane returned to Bogota, 
where the leftist politician died 
one hour after being admitted to a 
hospital, officials said.
Radio reports said more than 
100 people were aboard the Avianca Boeing 727 but that no pas
sengers or crew members were 
injured in the shootout.
The candidate, Carlos Pizarro, 
38, was the third presidential 
contender to be killed since April 
1989 in Colombia, which is en
gaged in a brutal war with drug 
trafficking cartels.
Pizarro was commander of the 
M-19 guerrilla movement, which 
disbanded March 8 and surren
dered its weapons, becoming a 
political party.

Senate approves 
major parts of 
spending plan
WASHINGTON (DJ)  The 
Senate has approved major pro
visions of a fiscal 1990 spending 
bill that would add almost $3.3 
billion to domestic and foreignaid accounts, including $720 mil
lion in economic assistance to the 
new governments of Panama and 
Nicaragua.
By a 51-48 margin, the Repub
lican leadership narrowly beat 
back a Democratic proposal to cut 
$120 million from the proposed 
aid to Panama. But to finance the 
accompanying domestic initia
tives, the Pentagon will be forced 
to accept deeper reductions than 
it had wanted.
Provisions adopted on Friday 
would rescind an estimated $1.54 
billion from selected military 
operations accounts, and an 
across-the-board cut of approxi
mately 1.6 percent would result 
in further reductions of an esti
mated $2.1 billion. A portion of 
these funds is restored elsewhere 
to cover a shortfall in Pentagon 
personnel accounts, but the net 
reduction in military appropria
tions would be more than $2.86 
billion in the fiscal year ending 
September 30.
For the Bush administration, 
the Central American package 
remains the centerpiece of the 
legislation, but the State Depart
ment has been forced to fight at 
each step in the Senate against 
Appropriations Committee Chair 
Robert Byrd.
Dem poised to 
compromise on 
capital gains tax
WASHINGTON (D J)  Chair
man Dan Rostenkowski (D-Hl.) of 
the House Ways and Means Com
mittee said he would consider cut
ting the capital-gains tax as part
of a large deficit reduction pack
age negotiated with the White 
House.
In answer to a question during 
an address to the National Ven
ture Capital Association, the 
Congressman said a package 
could be put together that could 
possibly include capital gains, 
and added, Im a fellow who 
works in the vineyard of compro
mise.
The comments clarify what has 
gone largely unspokenparticu
larly by Rostenkowski: One rea
son President Bush might even
tually embrace a big tax-increase 
and spending-cut bill is that the 
package is a probable vehicle for 
the capital-gains cut he wants.
The comments also point up the 
common wisdom among lawmak
ers and policy makers here that 
the most likely solution to the 
fiscal stalemate this year is a 
summit between leadinglawmakers and high-level Bush admini
stration officials.
Officially, Rostenkowski op
poses the capital-gains tax cut. 
Indeed, his prepared speech to 
the venture capitalists, who are 
leading the fight to cut the tax, 
asserted that he is prepared to 
make a comprehensive case 
against a preferential capitalgains tax rate.
But his rhetoric softened when 
questioning turned to compro
mises that might be necessary to 
accomplish Rostenkowskis main 
goal this year, deficit reduction. 
In effect, he said that compro
mises might be necessary to at
tain the kind of budget cuts and 
tax increases that would trans
late into a meaningful reduction 
in the budget deficit. To date, Bush 
has resisted supporting major tax 
increases.
Bush renews 
appeal for lineitem veto power
WASHINGTON (AP)  Presi
dent Bush has appealed anew for
a line-item veto and broader power 
to rescind funds Congress has 
appropriated.
The president needs the power 
to make the tough calls on spend
ing, take the heat  and Im 
perfectly prepared to do that, said 
Bush, also urging that the 
Constitution be amended to re
quire a balanced budget.
The government this year is 
running a deficit of $150 billion; 
Bush has proposed a $63 billion 
deficit for next years budget.
His three-part strategy entails:
A proposed constitutional 
amendment giving the president 
line-item veto authority.
 Support for a Legislative Line 
Item Veto Act, which would widen 
his power to rescind funds already 
appropriated by Congress.
 Endorsement of the balanced 
budget amendment introduced by 
Senator Strom Thurmond(R-S.C.)
He said seven of his predeces
sors had requested line-item veto 
authority; 43 governors already 
possess such power.
Under current law, a president 
can only veto an entire piece of 
legislation. The president cannot 
excise particular expenditures the 
White House finds objectionable.
Bush strikes 
Japan from list of 
unfair traders
WASHINGTON (DJ)  Presi
dent Bush has taken Japan off 
the U.S. list of unfair traders, 
but announced measures to fol
low-up on agreements to lower 
structural trade barriers.
Bush also removed the desig
nation of Brazil as an unfair 
trader, but maintained India on 
the list. Bush also said that the 
U.S. could use the tough 301 
clause of the 1988 Trade Act in 
the future to follow up on marketopening moves as appropriate. 
Further he called for a follow-up 
to talks on removing so-called 
structural impediments to 
trade.
The move to take Japan from 
the list of countries deemed to 
have unfair trade barriers under 
Super 301 clause of the 1988Trade 
Act was an apparent effort to 
maintain smooth relations with 
Tokyo in the wake of several major  
trade liberalizations in wood 
products, supercomputers and 
satellites trade.
The move will disappoint many 
on Capitol Hill, in particular the 
powerful chairman of the Senate 
Finance committee, Lloyd 
Bentsen (D-Texas) who said not 
naming Japan in a fresh Super 
301 action would be a mistake.*
Japanese public reaction to the 
moves is likely to be more positive 
than it would have been had the 
U. S. kept the country on the Super 
301 list, analysts said.
Bush hospitalized 
for glaucoma test
WASHINGTON (DJ)  Presi
dent Bush underwent tests last 
Wednesday at Bethesda Naval 
Hospital to re-confirm a previous 
diagnosis that he has an early 
case of glaucoma in his left eye, 
the White House said.
The tests will be conducted by 
two doctors who are experts on 
glaucoma, and they will re-con
firm the diagnosis reached in aj 
recent routine physical and the 
treatment ordered then, the White 
House added.
I wish to emphasize there are 
no problems with the presidents 
vision, Dr. Burton Lee, the White 
House physician said in a state
ment.
Since the initial diagnosis o;f 
glaucoma, the president has been 
using eyedrops to treat the condi
tion, which could lead to loss of, 
vision if left untreated.

Rosenblum cites the operational cost 
of the program at $400 per month. Its a 
good idea, but more money is needed, he 
said.
He also said that the recycling pro
gram needs a full-time coordinator to 
deal with its problems.
The program also put too much of a 
burden on the American Building Main
tenance workers who were responsible 
for the actual transportation of the waste 
paper to the site where it was picked up. 
According to Rosenblum, ABM would 
have to hire approximately eight more 
workers to accommodate the extra 30 
minutes that was needed for each floor of 
Warner Hall.
Another problem with University-wide 
implementation of the program is that of 
getting the recyclable material to a cen
tral location where it can be collected. In
the Warner Hall program, containers 
were placed under each desk in Warner 
Hall; waste white paper was put into the 
containers and collected by ABM em
ployees.
However, this manner of collecting 
paper would not work well on a Univer
sity level with the current number of 
ABM employees; more are needed to 
cover the additional workload. Two other 
options which Rosenblum proposed are 
to have recyclable paper collected by 
work-study students or by individual 
office employees.
In one proposal, a semi-centralized 
program could be instituted in which 
each office area would have its own recy
cling bin and would be responsible for 
putting its own recyclable materials in a 
certain location, like outside the office 
door. Work-study students would then 
take those materials to a central location
Weve been recycling in our own office ever 
since the program was announced. I think its 
a good idea and Im planning on continuing to 
doit.

Student Affairs
where they would be collected for recy
cling.
Rosenblum would like to see the pro
gram expanded to include the recycling 
of other materials, such as office stock 
paper.
However, he realizes that there are 
problems with an expanded program. 
Peoples definition of recycling is hav
ing a container under their desk and just 
dropping stuff in which is dirty or unrin
sed, he said. The University needs to 
make a commitment to recycling, which 
they havent done.
Student Affairs secretary Ruth Gallo 
said that the recycling program was an 
excellent idea and that the Office of 
Student Affairs plans to continue to
recycle on a voluntary basis.
Weve been recycling in our own office 
ever since the program was announced, 
she said. I think its a good idea and Im 
planning on continuing to do it.
She said that the Registrars office will 
also continue recycling.
Another step in a campus recycling 
effort is last Mondays opening of the 
glass recycling center located behind the 
Physical Plant building.
Glass to be recycled at this center 
should be clean and rinsed, should have 
the lids removed, and should be sepa
rated by color. However, the labels on 
the glass need not be removed before the 
container is deposited in the recycling 
collection bins.
The center is accessible by vehicle 24 
hours a day, seven days a week. The fifth 
floor of Wean Hall is no longer an accept
able glass drop-off location.

Alum donates money to finish CFA alcoves

; The alcoves surrounding the 
main entrance to the College of 
Fine Arts may soon be finished 
after over 70 years of incom.pletion, due to a grant from a

. Assistant Professor of Architec

finish, have not been worked on 
since World War I.
The project is going on and 
negotiations are underway, said 
Cleary. We hope in the next
couple weeks that things are 
firmed up, and hopefully by next 
fall students will see something 
happening.

While fundraising and develop
ment for the University Center 
seem to be on track, questions 
dealing with space allocation and 
types of facilities have yet to be 
resolved.
While a lead donor for the cen
ter has been identified, the name 
will not be released until details 
between the Trustees, the benefi
ciary, and the planning commit
tee have been finalized.
Senior Vice President Ed 
Schatz, who is the centers project 
manager, commented that the 
amount donated is significant 
and that it is enough that the 
building will be named after the 
individual and his family.
The target amount for construc
tion of the center is $41 million. 
To date, the committee has raised 
$27 million. The remainder of the 
fund raising will most likely come 
from alumni who are able to 
donate large amounts of money. 
The committee has also imple
mented a faculty and staff fund 
raising program. Kishore Rao, 
chair of the student University 
Center committee, pointed out 
that the class of 1989 made a 
donation to the building and that 
the fund raisers are looking into 
the possibilities of a graduating 
gift committee.
According to Dean of Student 
Affairs Michael C. Murphy, the 
planning committee is not clear 
about what exactly will happen 
during the transitional period. 
Kiltie will be moved out when the 
new dining facility in th new 
dorm opens. The Tartan Grill and
",Everyone will have to find a way to 
make it work.
 Kishore Rao, chair 
University Center student committee
Salads Plus will be moved into 
the space that Kiltie now occu
pies, and the remaining space will 
be reallocated dependingupon the 
available resources.
Several campus organizations 
which have definite space con
straints, such as WRCT, may be 
inconvenienced during the tran
sition because it is likely that 
they will given space which is not 
as accommodating as the space 
which they now occupy.
Another potential problem is 
that the temporary space may not 
be as centralized. According to 
Rao, groups which have tight 
space requirements will be con
tacted in the fall to discuss their 
options. At this point, neither 
Murphy nor Schatz is sure of 
where these groups will be placed.
Everyone will have to find a 
way to make it work, said Rao.
Schatz said that at this point, 
the timetable is dependent en
tirely upon whether the planning 
committee is able to raise the final 
$14 million in order to begin site 
preparation. Site preparation is 
projected to begin on October 21, 
1991, and the project should be 
completed by September 1,1993. 
Schatz also said that the sche
matic design phase committee is 
still ironing out details about the 
plans of how much space is needed
and where. Schatz continued to 
say that the main aspects of the 
plans are complete, but that fine 
points are still in the process oi 
changing according to the needs 
of various groups.
According to Murphy, the Uni
versity Centers three main func
tions will be activities, dining., 
and recreation. The plans for the 
dining facility incorporate the; 
students desire for variety by; 
having three to five units with; 
items such as Mexican food, Chi
nese food, and other specialties. 
Dining Service is conducting opin
ion polls which also elaborate a' 
proposal to bring commercial! 
franchises into Dining ServiceThis proposal to bring in fast food 
franchises, however, will not be 
decided until the question of its 
effects on contract rates is an
swered.
The athletic facilities in the 
center will include an auditorium,- 
racquetball and squash courts, a 
workout room, and locker rooms: 
The question of whether an in-; 
door track will be included is still; 
being discussed, but the track isr 
not currently included in the; 
budget. According to Rao, the{ 
architects and the planning com
mittee are looking into the possi
bility of designing the structure 
so that a track can be added later.

4The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  1 May 1990
Bailey resigns; GSIA names acting dean
continued from page 1
term things. It didnt sound like she was 
retiring, he said. This conflicts with 
Cyerts claim that Bailey resigned on her 
own.
For McGuire, there were no subtle 
Hints. I was asked by the provost to 
resign about two Fridays ago, said 
McGuire, and I didnt at the time. Since 
then I have been told by [Epple] twice 
that he doesnt plan to have a deputy 
dean in his administrative structure.
The reason behind the changes re
mains a mystery for the GSIA commu
nity. McGuire was not given a reason 
when called on to resign by Jordan. Bailey 
could not be reached for comment. 
^According to Jerry Salancik, a GSIA 
professor, Its a very unusual time to 
sk for a resignation, making reference 
to GSIAs 40th Anniversary and Presi
dent Mehrabians upcoming installment. 
T havent heard any students or faculty 
groups demanding the resignation of 
Dean Bailey, he said.
^When the rumors of Baileys call to 
rpsign began, the uniform reaction, said 
McGuire, was that the whole situation 
wasnt handled in a way that was good 
for GSIA or Dean Bailey.
* i(A group of concerned GSIA faculty 
expressed their discontent by way of an 
anonymous open letter to GSIA faculty, 
staff, students, alumni, and CMU ad
ministration and trustees. The letter
conveyed their dismay about the proc
ess that has been revealed during the 
past few weeks regarding the termina
tion of Dean Elizabeth Baileys appoint
ment and the selection of an Acting Dean 
and the implications of this process for 
the future of GSIA as a business school. 
The letter made note of the 
administrations total lack of sensitiv
ity, given the 40th Anniversary and 
the Bosch Institute Kick-off and the 
graduation ceremonies of our students. 
Presently, no one is able to point to any 
particular reasons as to why Bailey would 
have been asked to leave. In fact, deans 
are customarily up for review every five 
years, and Bailey was reappointed two 
years ago. The mystery remains, and so 
does the discontent that followed.
One of the biggest problems for GSIA, 
according to McGuire, is the uncertainty 
of the schools future. Just a change in 
deans, he said, especially the way it 
happened, leads to a lot of uncertainty. A 
new president compounds the problem. 
Business schools and academia in 
general, said McGuire, are very com
petitive. Thus, the uncertainty that now 
exists concerning GSIAs future makes it 
harder to hire people as well as increas
ing the likelihood of valued faculty 
members taking jobs elsewhere, in more 
stable environments.
Baileys letter of resignation makes no 
mention of being asked to leave. She
I was asked by the provost to resign about 
two Fridays ago, and I didn't at the time. 
Since then I have been told by [Epple] twice 
that he doesnt plan to have a deputy dean in 
his administrative structure.
 Timothy McGuire, 
GSIA deputy dean
called her seven years of service as dean 
as both a pleasure and an opportunity. 
She said she was happy with the direc
tion in which GSIA was headed. As 
GSIA has grown it has been well sup
ported by its membership in the wider 
CMU community, read the letter. I am 
pleased that GSIAs expanded mission 
and capabilities have contributed to 
mutual growth in programs and prestige 
for CMU.
Bailey said that she achieved a num
ber of goals she set for GSIA when she 
first accepted the position. They include: 
expanding the scope of the schools ac
tivities to make it more responsive to our 
masters students, the business commu
nity, and our alumni; modernizing and 
expanding the facilities for our work, 
including computing and data support
capabilities for faculty, staff, and stu
dents; and the establishment of new 
cross-campus centers and institutes to 
address the rapid change in business 
issues, stated the letter.
Among the most notable events under
way at GSIA under Baileys administra
tion, stated the letter, are the Carnegie 
Bosch Institutea unique partnership 
[that] will position GSIA for increasing 
leadership in international manage
ment  and the Donald H. Jones En
trepreneurship Center and Information 
Networking Institute, which she identi
fied as an impressive broadening of the 
range of contemporary issues GSIA is 
addressing ... a direct reflection of our 
success in attracting ... new businessoriented faculty.
Bailey will be leaving many admirers
throughout the GSIA community, one of 
whom is Claudia Kirkpatrick, associate 
head of the Industrial Management and 
Economics departments. [GSIA] made 
great strides in undergraduate educar 
tion, said Kirkpatrick of Baileys ad
ministration. She forsees the continu
ation of progress under the acting dean 
and the new dean.
Kirkpatrick views Bailey as a source 
of inspiration personally and profession^ 
ally. She will have a major impact in 
whatever she chooses to do, she says. 
This is a person of great stature.
McGuire also lauds Baileys career, 
looking back to the environment of her 
initial appointment. It was a school that  
needed to be built up substantially, and 
all that got turned around, he said. Its 
to her total credit.
Epple, too, acknowledged the progress 
that GSIA has made under Bailey, and 
plans to continue the process. Over the 
course of the coming year, he said, Illt 
focs on our successes and the many op
portunities that have come from thei. 
GSIA is a really excellent schodl; 
said Epple, weve got a first-rate faculty 
and first-rate students. Weve got a his
tory and reputation of being at the fore
front.
Its a very challengingjob, Epple said, 
and I have a lot to learn  learning the 
dimensions of the school in order to con
tinue to move forward.

The major obstacle to begin

tract with the donor has to be

contracts and agreements have

The original plans of Henry

The project architects are look

Senate will take 
new direction

.Neighbors praise of the turnout, 
.however.
It was pathetic. It was abso
lutely pathetic. Its almost an 
.embarrassment to win. I mean, I 
1 feel like Im representing no one. 
It was just pathetic, he said.
Although only six people peti
tioned to run for the twenty avail
able seats on Senate, all but one 
of the Senate positions were filled.
, This was due to write-in candi'  dates who accepted the positions 
for which they had been voted.
We should have a full Senate 
in the fall, which would be nice, 
said Neighbor.
 [ Neighbor has been discussing 
3 #ith Assistant Dean of Student 
Affairs Anne Witchner possible 
changes in the operation of Sente.
:. Neighbor said, Were coming 
up with a very re-vamped Senate. 
:) The fall is going to bring a lot of 
changes, I think, to the whole 
Senate. And hopefully, theyre
positive ones.
Neighbor hopes that some of 
these changes will increase stu
dents involvement in Senate and 
student government.
For example, the Office of Stu
dent Affairs compiles a list of 
committees on which students 
may serve, such as the Parking 
Committee, the Board of Trus
tees, and the University Discipli
nary Committee.
Normally, said Neighbor, Sen
ate is given such a short time to 
fill these positions that the Sena
tors end up filling the positions 
themselves.
The [University! administra
tion and the staff feel that theyre 
getting student input, but whats 
happening is theyre getting a 
group of people  Senators basi
cally  who are getting all of this 
involvement and all of this knowl
edge. Its not filtering out to the 
general campus, and what we 
need to do is make those positions 
more readily available to outside

Neighbor has discussed the idea 
of expanding the amount of stu

Dean of Student Affairs Michael 
Murphy, and Murphy feels that it 
is a good idea. Student Affairs 
will present Senate with a com

Senate will heavily advertise the 
positions in The Tartan and the 
Student Union.
Were going to try to bring in 
people from all over who might be

point them at a special Senate 
meeting, said Neighbor. That 
way, hopefully it allows people 
who have various interests to 
come out and get on these com

Warner Hall summit
Thomas Nichols/Tartan Photo Editor
Six student leaders met with President-elect Mehrabian in a forum sponsored by The Tartan last Thursday. Spirits Michael Bowman, CFP 
President John Glnsburg, the Womens Center's Heather Hood, Student Government President Mark Mittelhauser, Student Government 
President-elect Kishore Rao, and Student Senator Matt Ruben spoke with Mehrabian about the Issues that they believed to be the most 
important for the campus that Mehrabian will begin to lead on July 1. Due to technical difficulties, The Tartan was unable to publish a 
transcript of the discourse as it had planned.
Undergraduate college idea
^ continued from page 1
last week, Mehrabian expressed 
( iis desire to see someone who 
; wakes up every morning and 
; thinks only about undergraduate 
! education.
^ According to H&SS Student 
I Senator Matt Ruben, there exists 
! a basic problem in that many de! partments currently have limited 
i resources and certain unchange
able structures.
'j': In addition, Mittelhauser feels 
that the college would provide 
more of a feeling of University
affiliation rather than a depart
mental affiliation; in other words, 
students would identify them
selves as Carnegie Mellon un
dergraduates rather than as en
gineering students or philoso
phy students.
The main problem weve been 
faced with is the question of 
someone saying, I want to be the 
best mechanical engineer there 
is, and our answer to that is, the 
definition of what the best engi
neer is is changing, and it should 
change,  said Ruben.
A task force, chaired by H&SS 
Dean Stephen Fienberg, will be 
created in the fall to investigate 
undergraduate education.
Student Government President-elect Kishore Rao would like 
to see an undergraduate dean po
sition created. This dean would 
have some budgetary control and 
the ability to create and distrib
ute teaching awards.
Rao is not sure, however, that 
the undergraduate college is nec
essarily the best solution to the 
problems at hand.
emerges
The kind of student that the 
University would be looking for is 
very different that the type of 
students that are here now; they 
would need more leadership and 
communication skills, which I 
dont think the University incor
porates right now, he said.
These concerns came up when 
the humanities were first intro
duced to Carnegie Mellon, Ruben 
said. The problems are being 
brought up over and over, and 
this is evidence that theyre not 
being addressed, he said.
continued from page 1
the [Presidential] committees are 
doing. Its very easy to set up a 
block of committees, and then 
things kind of slow down, and you 
never keep up on them. Thats 
really the challenge; thats the 
whole idea of leadership.
Rao will begin setting up his 
Presidential committees before 
the end of the 1990 spring semes
ter. The reason I want to do it 
now is I think its very important 
because summer is going to be a 
time of learning for Dr. Mehra
bian. I want to be ready and or
ganized to work with him in the 
summer, he said.
Raos administrative plan will 
begin with four main committees: 
the Academic Task Force, the 
University Center Committee, the 
Quality of Living Task Force, and 
the Fine Aits Task Force.
The Academic Task Force will 
focus on the quality of teaching 
and advising, making the fresh
man year less stressful in terms 
of pass/fail grading, and making 
it optional for freshman grades to 
appear on transcripts, among 
other agenda items.
The University Center Commit
tee, which Rao currently chairs, 
will deal with gathering and for
warding student input on the 
planning of the University Cen
ter. That [committee] is very 
important because the planning 
process is going on as we speak, 
and we need to be involved now, 
he said.
The Quality of Living Task 
Force will work to improve the 
traditional support services such 
as the Health Center and the 
Escort service, as well as Dining 
Service, Housing, and retail stores 
prices, social events, and social 
life.
The Fine Arts Task Force will 
work towards solving such prob
lems as lack of ventilation and 
lack of studio space. It will also 
work toward establish a fine arts 
performance center.
Rao wants to involve faculty 
members, administrators, and 
Trustees as well as students in 
the committees.
I think another way to charac
terize my whole term would be 
just to get people involved, he 
said. I want to find interested 
and talented students and give 
them the opportunity to make 
changes happen. Thats the fun
damental thing. I want to draw as 
many people as I can into student 
government. The key is that I 
have to go out and find these 
people. Hopefully, some will come

money came from

to me. There is the opportunity to 
work on not only the issues Im 
interested in, but the issues 
theyre interested in as well. 
There are three separate issues 
which Rao will pursue on his own. 
The first is to try to use the fund 
of over a million dollars which the 
University has accumulated 
through profits on the retail stores 
to benefit the students. They have 
this money, and I see it as student 
money, he said.
Rao would like to use $40,000- 
$50,000 of the interest from the 
fund to set up an endowment fund 
for Spring Carnival. I think 
Carnival is something that every
one benefits from, he said. Sinfce 
this money came from all the 
students, it should be directedio 
helping all the students.
If Carnival is funded, then the 
money which Senate usually 
budgets for Carnival can be given 
to other groups. Rao said, I s,ee 
that as a short term and a long 
term solution to getting us out .of 
the mess we are in now.
Rao is also working on the fifthyear tuition-free program which 
was conceptualized here two years 
ago by past Student Government 
President Andrew Robitshejc. 
Carnegie Mellon espouses a 
professional, liberal, wellrounded, diverse, broad educa
tion. Time just does not permit 
that. People are stretched to the 
limit as it is. Carnegie Mellon is 
truly committed to this cause 
which will give students the one 
resource they dont have, ar^d 
thats time, said Rao.
Raos third project is creating.a 
new administrative position, that 
of an Academic Ombudsman. The 
primary focus of this position 
would be to improve undergradu
ate education.
I see an Academic Ombuds
man as an interim solution  
someone who is going to crusade 
for education. Eventually, I would 
like to see a dean for undergradu
ate education, he said.

$100.
But not everyone in Murphys 
office agrees with his prediction.
I doubt that Senate would want 
to recommend an increase [in the 
fee] to the Trustees after it failed 
the referendum, said Assistant 
Dean of Student Affairs Anne 
Witchner, who will replace Asso
ciate Dean Lois Cox as account 
director for student organizations 
in July.
Michael Loomis, the GSIA 
Senator who wrote a letter to the 
editor of The Tartan last week 
asking that students vote against 
the increase, said that he was 
pleased that the referendum 
failed. I hope that it will make 
Senate think twice before allocat
ing their money to events that 
could occur without Senate fund
ing, he said.
I think that a lot of organiza
tions will do okay without the 
additional funding for this one 
year, he said.
Loomis opposes the fee hike 
because a portion of the money 
would go toward funding frater
nity parties. Senate voted two 
weeks ago to make a special allo
cation to fraternities and sorori
ties to fund their Rush programs, 
which are open to the entire 
campus. I thought that was in
appropriate, he said. They can 
fund themselves quite well. Thats 
a misallocation of resources.
Otis Ginsburg, president of the 
Council of Fraternity Presidents, 
was disappointed by the failure of 
the referendum. I think that the 
whole campus loses because it 
lost, he said.
The special allocation of$l9,150 
made for Dry Rush two weeks ago 
seems to be in imminent danger.
The Dry Rush allocation is now 
impossible, said Neighbor. They 
arent getting their money and 
they know it.
The allocation includes $3500 
for the annual Watermelon Bash, 
traditionally funded by Senate.
Neighbor said that a special allo
cation would have to be made for 
that event.
Loomis lays blame for any fi
nancial woes on the entire Sen
ate. There is too much rhetorical 
positioning and too little looking 
at the facts, he said. We spend 
more time talking than we do 
thinking.
I had none of the economic 
facts, he said. I learned none of 
the relevant financial informa
tion. Other senators have as little 
or less information regarding 
Senates financial state than I 
do.
But officials seem prepared to 
deal with an outcome in which 
the fee is not raised: either if 
Senate chooses not to recommend 
an increase to the Trustees, or if 
the Trustees choose not to ap
prove such an increase.
Neighbor said that one option 
involves trimming organizations 
budgets. We are going to have to 
cut them below the level they 
received last year, he said.
He explained that the allocaThomas Nichols/Tartan Photo EditorA gracious sendoff...

Thistles and Thoms, 1990
Its time once again for our an
nual Thistles and Thorns edito
rial. We award Thistles to people 
and groups on campus who de
serve some recognition for their 
positive contributions to the CMU 
community over the past year. 
Thorns, on the other hand, go to 
those who would have better 
served the campus community by 
. keeping out of the way.
Well start by awarding Thistles 
to Greek philanthropy, which has 
come a long way this year, and to 
Big Brothers/Big Sisters, which is 
becoming one of CMUs most vis
ible ways of helping the Pittsburgh 
community.
Faculty Search Chair John 
Fetkovich and the rest of the presi
dential search committees get a 
big Thistle for landing Dr. Robert 
Mehrabian as CMUs next presi
dent  were excited about his fu
ture here.
The Warner Hall brass shares a 
big Thom with GSIA for bum
bling the resignation/termination 
of Dean Elizabeth Bailey so close 
to the schools 40th anniversary 
celebration. A business school 
should be able to handle power 
politics better than that.
Administrators pick up several 
Thistles this year: H&SS Dean 
Stephen Fienberg gets one for 
making Modern Languages a full 
department, and the Registrars 
Office snags one for finally taking 
steps to improve registration.
Moving on to student govern
ment, the student body gets a 
Thorn for shooting down the Ac
tivities Fee raise last week  it 
takes money to improve the qual
ity of life, and you shouldnt com
plain if youre not willing to pay 
the price of improvement.
Now that the students have spo
ken, however, weve got another 
Thorn waiting in the wings if Stu
dent Senate txies to act against 
the referendums results. Either 
the student body calls the shots or 
we dont have a student-run 
democracy. You be the judge.
Senate does pick up a Thistle for 
implementing a well-thought-out 
postering policy earlier this year, 
but theres a Thorn attached be
cause the group, in a fit of stupid
ity, later violated its own policy.
The Activities Board picks up 
two Thorns this year. The group 
gets the first for not giving stu
dents the full value of their dollar, 
and the second for not taking pro
active steps to improve its image 
on campus.
Send a Thorn down to the Pen
tagon for us, because the militarys 
(and hence ROTCs) discrimina
tion against gays is something 
that we despise as students, as 
taxpayers, and as voters.
Back on campus, weve got a 
Thistle for the organizers of the 
much-needed Womens Cente. 
And those sexists who continue to 
laugh at the Center can share a 
Thorn with the worst of the di
versity backlash movement, ex
emplified by sneering diversity 
rally posters and splashing paint 
on a pro-gay fence.
Wed also like to hand out 
Thistles to the mens cross coun
try team, which didnt lose a dual 
meet in the 1980s, and to the crew 
team, which has become a thriv
ing, competitive organization with 
a hell of a lot of pride in just over 
two years. Way to go, folks.
A Thistle goes out to Dean Lois 
Cox of Student Affairs; shes retir
ing after serving CMU for 21 years.
And could we forget? President 
Richard Cyert gets a Thistle for 
his 18 years of leadership of the 
University. We may not have 
always agreed with his decisions, 
but his heart was always in the 
work  the highest praise you 
can earn at Carnegie Mellon.
Weve got some personal Thistles 
to give out, too. To Bill Kisner, our 
custodian, for putting up with our 
messy production days; to ex-staffer Bot Ow,,,,,;, fn,. urinnjna. J-J^g 
schools first Watson Fellowship 
and always lighting up our office; 
and to graduating staff members 
Dan Bidwa, Mike Drout, Jon 
Elderfield, Carlos Franco, Judy 
Haraburda, Mich Jones, Chris 
Kush, Soo-Tsu Leng, Eric Leuliette, Stewart Levine, Josh Ruben, 
and Karyn Silva, for putting in 
innumerable hours of quality work 
so that this paper could come out, 
on time, every week.
Finally, our two biggest Thistles 
go to past Editors-in-Chief Karl 
Barnhart and Russ Seligman, both 
graduating this year. Together, 
Karl and Russ guided The Tartan 
for two years. Theyve had a pro
found effect on our organization, 
and were indebted to them for 
their inspiration and dedication.

Mr. Crouse utterly disregards the complexities, subtleties, and differences 
within and across these issues, choosing 
instead to completely reduce and ho

political contention. Implicitly, he re

This letter is written 
as an appeal for the 
return ofthe portrait of Letter tODr. William G. Chasenho dPenaIwhich was taken from 
the Psychology Department last week. 
This portraithgf ^aTovKfTiill 
Chase. Dr. Chase died suddenly of a 
heart attack on December16,1983, while 
jogging on campus.
The portrait, along with the Biennial 
Chase Memorial Award, is a reminder of 
Bill Chases contribution to the Psychol
ogy Department and to Carnegie Mellon 
University.
Dr. Chase was an extremely well-liked 
teacher of the large undergraduate course 
on Introduction to Cognitive Psychology. 
He also gained national recognition for 
his experiments demonstrating that good 
memory is an acquired skill. His spe
cialty was mnemonics, a technique used 
in memory improvement that utilizes 
meaningful associations. In one very
famous series of studies, Dr. Chase 
worked with a CMU undergraduate who 
was a long-distance runner. They devel
oped a system for memorizing long se
quences of random numbers by relating 
the numbers to various classes of run
ning times. The student was able to
of up to 100 digits.
The following statement by Dr Char 
les Kiesler, former Dean of H&SS, sums up all of our feeling atju...*. n,. L,
His research represented the frontier of 
scientific work done on human memory. 
He was one of the worlds nicest people, 
and his death is a great loss to each one 
of us at the University.
The Psychology Department suffered 
a terrible loss when Bill Chase died. The 
loss of his portrait saddens his students, 
colleagues, and friends.
The department would appreciate any 
information leading to the return of this 
portrait. Please contact Mark Brown, 
Business Manager of Psychology, at
x3152, if you can assist in our search.

What purpose did 
Michael Ewedosh 
serve in attacking the Letter tO
Tk I'Jo tatHoI nho dPenaItrial [ Keep it off the 
street and out of court, 4/17]? His argu
ments that pro-lifers have no business 
publicly protesting for their cause lacked 
any credibility.
Michael, the Constitution of the United 
States protects the right to publicly pro
test. Many pro-lifers legally utilize this 
right to demonstrate the need for change 
in this countrys abortion laws.
I agree with Ewedosh that political 
action is more effective, but every person
differs in how he acts on a situation. If 
you saw a small child drowning in a 
backyard pool, would you go to your 
legislature and lobby for the child to be 
removed from the pool? No, you would 
jump the fence and trespass onto the 
lawn to save the child yourself. Unfortu
nately, this country has thousands of 
children dying daily.
The police can disperse protests if they 
observe three or more people engaged in 
disorderly conduct, which is defined as 
any action leading to a hazardous or 
physically offensive condition, which may 
include violence, destruction of property, 
fighting, tumult, unnecessary noise, or 
serious inconvenience. The rather pas
sive demonstrators, by blocking a clinics 
doorway, were causing only an incon
venience. How serious an inconvenience 
it was depends on perspective; this is 
what the jury will decide.
But convicted or not, these 68 coura
geous people have shown just how dedi
cated they are to their cause. They risked 
going to jail, not for any selfish motive, 
but for an ideal. Anyone willing to alter 
the course of their lives for something 
they believe in deserves respect. This is 
what our country was founded on, and  
this is what keeps it going.

Carnival lacked ecological responsibility
Editor: Qs
Perhaps the ultimate 
irony of Earth Day is 
that it coincided with Letter tO 
the end of Spring Carthe E(Jjtor 
nival. It is when the 
midway booths come down that one 
realizes the amount of waste generated 
by our annual ritual.
While waiting for the start ofthe Oingo 
Boingo concert, one cannot help but notice 
the five large refuse containers on the 
midway rapidly filling up with what use 
to be booths: wood scraps, styrofoam, 
nails, sheet rock, cardboard, and other 
building materials. Accordingto sources, 
larger pieces of wood are either kept, if 
the organization have available storage,
or given to charity. Yet that is not evi
dent from a quick perusal of the contain
ers.
While I enjoy Carnival as much as 
everyone else (not so this year due to 
academics), it was nevertheless disturb
ing that so many renewable and non
renewable resources were spent on three 
days of festivities. Most of what was 
thrown away, especially styrofoam, will 
remain well after we are long gone.
Much more can be and should be done 
by the Carnival Committee to reclaim 
what we throw away at Carnival. Parts 
of the booths can be sold to benefit char
ity. The campus community can be in
vited to take what they want from the 
booths after the organizations take what
they want to keep.
Scrap wood can be collected and be 
made available to anyone who wants it.
It also can be made into mulch for Physi
cal Plant to use (instead of the usual  
stuff). Although much coordination is 
needed to implement these alternatives, 
the ecological benefits would be well 
worth the effort.
Serendipitously, Pi Kappa Alpha hit 
on the ingenious idea of the recyclable . 
booth. Not much can be said for the 
originality of the Batwheel from year to 
year, but it is perhaps the most ecologi
cally responsible booth of all.

bread utopia, he suggests that those 
hypersensitive complainers learn to 
perceive the true nature of their dis
crimination, to realize what is preju
dice.
Moreover, since the problems of dis
crimination are their problems (obvi
ously since they are the ones who suf
fer, right?), resolving the ethnic and 
racial issues on campus becomes the 
responsibility of the victims of discrimi
nation. As he says, I think much of the 
problem lies with the minority in itself.
In suggesting that targets of discrimi
nation simply learn to accommodate 
instances of racism and sexism, Mr. 
Crouse replicates one of the oldest de
fenses of systems of domination and ex
clusion  blaming the victim for the 
crime.
His argument effectively forestalls 
solutions to problems of racism and sex
ism by rendering instances of discrimi
nation more palatable to the status quo;
presumably, racism and sexism will sim
ply disappear because victims wont 
mention it.
To this end, he offers untenable dis
tinction between two kinds of discrimi
nation: intentional and unintentional
 the latter referring to those acciden
tal slurs, unknowing act[s], or harm
less ... mistake[s] for which the vast 
majority cannot be realistically held 
responsible. While Mr. Crouse would 
seem a dubious representative for the 
harm suffered by others, he says noth
ing about who is to decide whether or not 
a given instance of discrimination is in
tentional, or how such determinations 
are made.
On top of it all, the logic of his distinc
tion suggests that where there is no 
intention to discriminate, no offense can 
be rendered  that, in essence, there is 
no victim since no crime has been com
mitted. Rather, the target of discrimina
tion actually victimizes him/herself by 
mistaking an unintended gesture for
an intended one; suffering is self-in
duced, and not attributable to any 
agency other than the victim. Racism 
without racists, sexism without sexists, 
and so on.
Thus, Mr. Crouse attempts to locate 
race, class, gender, and ethnic oppres
sion exclusively at the level of subjec
tive interiority. In his argument, ame
liorating racism or sexism becomes a 
simple matter of victims deciding  
fantasizing  that they have not expe
rienced an instance of animosity or per
secution.
Reality passes as a function of the 
victims imagination, while the need to 
address the real circumstances of dis
crimination are conveniently circum
vented. The unfettered ignorance of a 
discriminatory status quo is neatly 
preserved, while the subjects of its in
different violences are left to fend for 
themselves.
What we need here is a more carefully 
articulated theory of the relation be
tween discrimination on the one hand, 
and racial, gender, and ethnic oppres
sion on the other  a theory that at
tempts to understand how such oppres
sion materially functions at interpersonal 
and swprapersonal (structural) levels in 
society.
We can begin by recognizing discrimi
nation as a specific gesture of the selec
tion which effects specific instances of 
oppression, while terms like racism and 
sexism name the other particular char
acter of discrimination by attending to 
the object of oppressionAfrican-Ameri
cans, women, the working class, etc. The 
mechanisms by which discriminations 
are effected are complex and manifold, 
having conscious and unconscious, 
interp er sonal and structura I dimen sion s. 
One may be a racist without consciously 
discriminating, or one may be a willing, 
but unknowing participant in a struc
ture which effects racism. As such, dis
crimination need not be intentional or 
even conscious.
Indeed, unconscious expressions of the 
most deeply ingrained cultural assump
tions  about African-Americans, 
women, etc.  offer the most tenacious 
and pernicious forms of racism and sex
ism, precisely because a person doesnt 
know that they are being racist and/or 
sexist!
But the victim knows. And so, to dis
miss such expressions as harmless, on 
the grounds of an imputed lack of inten
tion, is to simply ratify ignorance  
what Mr. Crouse advocates in absolving 
citizens from educating themselves about 
cultural, racial, ethnic, gender, and sex
ual differences.
Victims of any form of oppression are 
compelled to raise the cry of injustice, as 
it is unlikely (as Mr. Crouse proves) that 
agencies of oppression will volunteer to 
do so.

Editor:
Z This letter is 
a response to 
, Dan Crouses 
letter [ Hy_ persensitivity 
problems must end, 4/24], I must 
again preface by saying that I do 
 not consider myself an advocate 
, for all ethnic minorities on cam
pus.
.  I agree with Mr. Crouse in his 
,.assertions that some people or 
. groups of people are rather quick 
in judging harmless mistakes
. as severe slurs. I also concede to 
Crouses point that people who do 
' not know, or who do not care to 
know, about the diverse groups 
around them are bound to make 
 such mistakes.
But, as Mr. Crouse himself 
indicates, we are all members of a 
common community. It is a com
higher knowledge at one of the 
most prestigious universities in 
the country.
For us to plead ignorance to the 
ways and customs of other people 
in our own backyard while telling 
the world how smart we are is lu
dicrous and very, very frighten
ing.
I certainly hope that in his 
pursuit of learning a trade, Mr. 
Crouse and others like him are 
also learning how to get along in 
the real world. That world is 
also filled with many diverse 
people.
We have a wonderful opportu
nity here at CMU because, again 
as Mr. Crouse indicates, so many 
different ethnic, religious, cul
tural, and sexually-oriented 
groups are present on this cam
pus.
Because of this, I agree with
a freshman sensitivity course, 
but not because of the reason he 
cites. I think that if the people on 
this campus would take the time 
and put forth the effort, we could 
learn about one another withoutpursuit of Mr. Crouse that we may not need
_ two 10 one*  c,, ,^cnt"oner^\ /k * oitem pizzas 11 o10 piz2a   O^IOTT
the confines of a classroom. Call 
me an idealist, but this process 
has worked for me.
Mr. Crouse insists that such a 
course is pointless because the 
groups should know enough to
not get offended by what he calls 
accidental slurs. This rationale 
is frightening because it would 
undermine everything for which 
this school and higher education 
in general stands.
Ignorance andnaivet are what 
education fights against. If com
puter ignorance is unacceptable 
on this universitys campus, why 
should social ignorance be toler
able? As we learn our respective 
trades, so, too, must we learn 
about one another.
Finally, I would just like to add 
that Mr. Crouse is totally off the 
mark to suggest that it is the re
sponsibility of the minorities to 
resolve the ethnic and racial ten
sions on this or any college cam
pus.
How can these groups be held 
responsible for the ignorance of 
those around them?
By pointing out slurs and insensitivities, malicious or other
wise, these groups are trying to 
educate those who made the slurs 
as well as the general public.
To passively sit back and let 
people malign you, your culture, 
or your lifestyle and know that 
they have absolutely no knowl
edge they are doing it is like walk
ing by a smoldering fire in a forest 
and making no motion to try and 
put it out.
Ignorance leads to bigotry, and 
at that point the real tensions 
start.
Mr. Crouses claims say we 
should all be tolerant of one an
other. But wouldnt this really be 
a better campus, and maybe a 
better world, if we were all a bit 
more knowledgeable about one 
another?

10The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  1 May 1990
Lets talk about those misconceptions
Theres one in every crowd. In 
his letter to the editor last week 
[Columnist misunderstood 
CAFEs rules, 4/24], Eric Leuliette took me to task for what he 
perceived as my suggestion of 
impropriety among environmen
talists, backing his point by as
suring us that in fact most envi
ronmentalists he knows ride 
bicycles, havent eaten tuna fish 
in years to protest dolphin kill
ing, and have bags of recyclables 
in their basements. Gosh, how 
can I refute such hard, empirical 
data?
Still, as an admirer of Leuliettes 
column that used to appear in 
these pages, I fear that if he has 
entirely missed the main points 
which I was trying to make in my 
column, it is entirely possible that 
others have as well. I feel it is my 
duty, then, to clarify my positions.
In my description of the arm
chair environmentalist, I was 
elaborating on the picture por
trayed by a friend of mine whom 
I mentioned as being disgruntled 
with his impression of the hypoc
risy surrounding Earth Day. My
aW)f
Randy Udavcak
point, however, was not to deride 
individual environmental efforts, 
but rather, to encourage them by 
refuting the position of my friend. 
As I said, Even if Earth Day is 
just the rantings of yuppies and 
fair weather environmentalists as 
my friend suggested, its still a 
start to raising their conscious
ness about some very serious prob
lems. I was tiying to stress that 
government-level action isnt 
enough. As I said: While the 
intentions of the aforesaid regu
lations are noble enough,there 
must be a concomitant individual 
effort (which an over-zealous 
proofreader changed to noncomitant). The road to environmental 
efficiency, I continued, goes 
through Washington, but it does 
not begin there.
As for the CAFE regulations 
themselves, Leuliette writes that 
Udavcak also ignores the fact
that the fuel efficiency standards 
were instrumental in reducing oil 
consumptionin the United States 
and causing the oil glut. Again, 
; he has missed my point. I am well 
aware of the improvements 
wrought by such standards in 
terms of new car production in 
recent years, and I am the first to 
advocate their continuance. My 
point, however, was that contin
ual congressional wrangling over 
decimal points wastes valuable 
time that could be better spent 
devising ways to deal with more 
pressing problems, such as the 
millions of old, pre-catalytic con
verter cars on the roads today. 
Perhaps if Leuliette was better 
acquainted with the current state 
of domestic automobile pollution, 
he would know that a greater 
portion of the problem is the re
sult of old cars, not new; out of 
some 125 million cars on the roads 
today, over 40 percent are over 8 
years old, and more than 15 per
cent are over 10 years old. These 
vehicles were not built to any
where near the same pollution 
standards as today's cars, and the
combination oftime andneglected 
maintenance only aggravates the 
situation even further.
Finally, in reference to my pre
dicament over five gallons of used 
oil which I have been trying to 
recycle, Leuliette said that ap
parently, Udavcak called recy
cling centers and not the logical 
place to take oil  gas stations. 
While I did call recycling centers, 
as he suggests, this was a lastditch effort after exhausting the 
local service stations back in East 
McKeesport, Penn. They all told 
me the same thing, which to para
phrase said, Why dont you just 
dump it down the sewer?
But all that is history; thank 
you, Eric for finding a repository 
for the dregs of oil changes past 
right here in Oakland! I would 
have inquired there myself, but 
Prestone jugs full of used oil are 
not among the things I usually 
pack when heading back to school 
each fall.

Well it appears to have come fullcircle now. Yes, the transition of power 
frbm the leftist Sandinista regime, led 
by Daniel Ortega, to the democratically-elected Uno party, led by Violeta 
Barrios de Chamorro, has come to pass. 
In short, its about time. Yet this transit 
tion of power was not without its own 
foibles, to say the least. During the past 
seven years, years of promised elections 
by Ortega, to the verified and arduously 
observed elections held this past Febru
ary, the Sandinistas promises for in
creased freedom and economic and 
democratic reform fell short. So what do 
the red and black bandana-wearing 
Sandinistas have to show.for their tenyear hold on power in Nicaragua? NothDavid Schwartz
ing less than exporting terror and vio
lence to El Salvador vis-a-vis the FMLN, 
with the help of Cuba and ultimately the 
Soviet Union. With this abetting of the 
FMLN, the Sandinistas have greatly 
contributed to the violence and mayhem 
that plagued El Salvador for over five 
years. In addition, the Sandinistas have 
established themselves as militants, con
temptuous liars, and expounders of a 
great many half truths to their naive and 
arrogant supporters around the world,
including the U.S.
On the home front, the Sandinistas 
have forcefully seized young adult males 
to serve in the Sandinista Army which is 
the largest military force in Central 
America. It is interesting to note that the 
supposed goal of the Sandinistas in 1979 
was to extricate Nicaragua from the 
violence wrought by militancy and ar
mies. Instead, the Sandinistas have 
developed a massive fighting force bent 
on exporting the ideals of communism 
and revolution. The glorious revolu
tion of the Sandinistas has been proven 
an immense joke on the Nicaraguans.
Now, over ten years after the 1979 
takeover, Nicaraguans have freely 
elected a democratic candidate whose
goals and agenda have yet to be fully 
uncovered. Those plans surely have the 
propensity toward democracy and free
dom  something that is being decided 
upon and hastened to be installed 
throughout the world. Unfortunately, the 
Uno party will face a rather challenging 
uphill battle to mend the calamitous 
condition of the economy and excessively 
large military controlled by none other 
than Ortegas brotherit appears that 
nepotism was a favorite of Ortega in the 
delegation of power. There also remains 
a substantial cohort of militant Sandin
ista enthusiasts and sympathizers de
termined to disrupt the democratic proc
ess. This was clearly shown when, the 
Sandinistas purposely instigated union
tension and strikes hoping to strain the 
economy even more. Evidently, Ortega 
and his followers are upset that down
trodden Nicaraguans desiring change 
with Sandinista rhetoric were able to 
elect a party other than the Sandinistas. 
Chamorro must conquer all economic, 
political, social and cultural obstacles 
and hopefully, Nicaragua will rejoin the 
Latin American fold as a workable and 
undeniably successful democracy.
Actually, Chamorro and the Uno party 
have a great chance to succeed; they do 
have the support and the mandate of the 
Nicaraguans.

I have to move out of my apart
ment at the end of the month; its 
one of many tasks I face along 
with graduation.
I no longer fear moving  Ive 
moved each of my years at CMU. 
My stuff has gone from 
Poughkeepsie to Hamerschlag to 
Poughkeepsie to McGill (twice) to 
Forbes Avenue to Washington to 
Beeler Street. With each move, 
the pile has grown larger  from 
fitting in the back of my parents 
now-deceased Chevy wagon to two 
separate car loads.
Some of my things have sur
vived the years intact. My back
pack, a gift from my sister who 
learned after four years at Union 
College the importance of a back
pack, has proven hardier than a 
New York cockroach. And my be
loved amplifier/speakers are still 
with me, although theyre now 
hooked up to a CD player instead 
of a Walkman.
They bear the scars offive years 
at Carnegie Mellon. But some of 
my possessions didnt fare as well. 
Two walkmen burned out. Nu
merous socks were lost in the 
MMP dryers. I cant remember 
the last time I saw my tape of 
REMs Green.
The hardest thing for me to 
pack up will be my T-shirts. They, 
along with my issues of The Tar
tan, form a chronicle of my time 
at CMU. Some people measure 
their lives by milestones: first
InquiringMinds 
Stewart Levine
date, first car, first sex, and so on. 
I measure my time on campus 
through the shirts.
In my dresser I have 31 CMUrelated shirts, and Im sure I have 
more at home. They are momen
tos of Spring Carnivals and Home
comings past, clubs I used to be
long to, charity events, and even 
IM teams I played for.
I have a whole month of shirts. 
Unfortunately, I dont think my 
future employers would care to 
see me report to work in August
in my Plaid is Bad shirt, let 
alone any one of my seven WRCT 
shirts or four Fringe shirts.
Yet my collection is missing a 
few shirts. I lost my freshman ori
entation shirt a few years ago, 
even though I do have one from 
last year. I never bought a Stu
dent Senate shirt. I only bought 
Spring Carnival shirts my last 
two years here. Howmany memo
ries of Hollywood, Around the 
World, and Fairy Tales will I have 
compared to Toyland and Some
where in Timet
In many ways those shirts will 
be my most tangible link to my 
time herewearing CMU on my 
chest, forever linked to the school, 
its organizations, and the other
people who have them. Some of 
those shirts, my sleeping bagger 
shirt for one, are old enough to 
still have the dash between Car
negie and Mellon and were given 
out to hundreds of people, some 
who have that shirt as their only 
link to CMU. Other shirts have 
less than 10 copies in circulation
 we wearers will be a select 
group forever now  the 
silkscreens are gone.
I look at my bagger shirt again 
and feel old. Ive been here longer 
than Scotland Yard, the Student 
Union, Pioneers, the 14-degree 
square, 7:30 exams, and dry rush. 
Ive been an orientation counselor 
for nearly every undergraduate 
here.

Now its time to say goodbye. ""
My T-shirts and I will go home 
before I start work. Every time I 
put on one of those shirts Ill think 
of some part of my campus life. , 
Not all of the memories will be 
good, but most will. And when I 
think of the shirts, Ill think of the 
people associated with them.
I didnt always like Carnegie 
Mellon, but I always liked the 
people. I wonder how Ill get by 
without them. Maybe Ill buy a 
Homecoming 1990 shirt this fall.,-,.

Earth Day came and went in a flash 
and most people who are the least bit per
ceptive realized it was just a another 
corporate-sponsored event manipulated 
by environmentally destructive compa
nies in an effort save their own asses.
I wasnt the least bit surprised to see 
piles of donated McDonalds and Burger 
King dixie cups on the park grounds 
downtown. Or the sight of Coca-Cola di
verting peoples attention from South 
African apartheid and rain forest raping 
by supporting environmental causes.
Or the representative from Dow Chemi
cal who attended the Earth Day event.
Dows representative lied by saying 
that all plastics are non-toxic. She then 
explained that when plastics are heated 
and melted for recycling, the poisons re
leased comply with the lenient EPA regu
lations, apparently making everything 
okay.
Dow doesnt let you do great things. 
They lie to you so they can let themselves 
keep doing great things to mess up the 
environment  making billions in the 
process.
One of the positive results of Earth
Marc Fischer
Day was that a lot of people (including 
myself) learned new ways of making 
slight alterations in their lifestyles in 
efforts to be more environmentally ac
tive.
What pains me is that some people are 
so damn apathetic that no matter how 
easy things are made for them, they still 
refuse to use any foresight or take the 
time to think of anyone but themselves.
I find it amazing that with an alumi
num can recycling bin placed right next 
to the normal recepticle on my floor in 
Donner, I can sometimes walk by and 
find a dozen beer cans right on the sur
face of the trash can.
Are people so lazy that they cant take 
the half a second necessary to throw a 
can in a different trash recepticle in the 
same location?
A similar scenario can be seen at any 
given time in the library. There is a trash
can and a paper recycling box right next 
to almost every photocopy machine. But 
some people are still so incredibly uncar
ing that they will gladly opt to toss their 
paper in the trash rather than recycle.
Another thing that amazes me is that 
almost every time I walk into the bath
room on my floor, at least one sink is still 
lightly running.
How much effort does it take to turn a 
sink knob just a little bit harder?
I see people brushing their teeth with 
the water running full blast for five 
minutes. Or using the ice machines in 
Kiltie or Salads when there is a pile of 
clean excess ice sitting on the drainage 
grate of the machine already.
These complaints may sound petty, 
but at this stage in the environmental 
game people have to start thinking about 
them. This is the last column of mine you 
are going to see for this semester, so Im 
going to end just by asking people to 
make a slightly greater effort to be envi
ronmentally conscious and active. At 
CMU, things are made pretty easy for 
you if you want to recycle paper, alumi
num cans, and even glass in some places.
Most of you might not have strict state 
laws requiring you to recycle at home so 
you are going to have to take the initia
tive on your own.
The sad thing you must remember is 
that no matter how much you do to pro
tect the environment, it will probably 
never be enough to counter what corpo
rations like Dow, McDonalds, Exxon, 
and Ciba Geigi are doing to destroy it 
every day.
But do your part by making mild 
changes in your lifestyle. Learn to boy
cott and encourage your friends to do the 
same. Think before you mindlessly throw 
everythingaway. Stacks of paperprinted 
on one side make for cool stationery or 
other trivial purposes. Think before you 
buy something in a plastic container if a 
glass or cardboard alternative is readily 
available. Learn to re-use. Littering is 
pathetic if a trashcan lies only 15 feet 
away.
Take a train instead of driving. It 
doesnt cost a whole lot more, and its 
more fun. Walk, ride a bike, or take a bus 
if you are travelling short distances.
Try to reduce your meat intake or try
becoming a vegetarian. Meat production 
is the largest waste of resources in this 
country and a major obstacle thats pre
venting any end to world hunger.  5
After all that, Ill end on a positive note ' 
and say have a great summer, use your 
time wisely, and get some much-needed ' 
rest without resting your awareness or 
productivity. Hopefully the few columns  n 
I wrote providedyou with some good food^h 
for thought.

Mens tennis cleans up at PACs
SPORTSPOKE
by Josh RubenTartans sweep matches, 9-0
We play, we dream, 
we are obsessed
As children, we are taught 
and encouraged to play games.
As we grow older, we begin to 
take the games more seriously. 
Soon, we devote enough time 
and energy to these games that 
they become sports.
Occasionally, we take the 
games too seriously. Countless 
times, I have seen little leagu
ers throw down their gloves and 
run off the field because their 
parents or peers were putting 
too much pressure on them.
For the most part, however, 
we are obsessed. We live for 
Monday Night Football, the 
Game of the Week, or the 
weekly trip to the gym for an 
afternoon of pick-up basketball.
If youre good, you can parley 
your obsession into a living. You 
can live the dream of being a 
professional ball player, or 
maybe work for an athletic 
program at a high school or 
university. But, if youre really 
lucky, you can make it as a 
sports journalist.
When I started Sportspeak, I 
was determined to make it 
different from other sports 
columns. I wanted study and 
understand what it is about us 
that makes us spend billions of 
dollars and thousands of hours 
every year playing, watching, 
and reading up on sports.
I had grown sick and tired of 
guys (and some women) spilling 
out line after line of predictions. 
Who cares? One thing I have 
learned is th^t when it comes to 
sports, everyone is an expert.
I have learned other things: 
Some of the most interesting 
and some of the most boring 
people in the world are athletes 
and coaches. On the collegiate 
level, the masochists of the 
sports world are Sports Infor
mation Directors and women 
athletes  neither get much 
respect for the work they do.
The most significant thing I 
have learned is that there are 
two kinds of fans. First, there 
are the stats nuts. These are 
the people who can tell you 
Nolan Ryans rookie ERA or 
how many touchdowns Herschel 
Walker scored while in college. 
These people enjoy flaunting 
their knowledge, but are usu
ally total zeros in the personal
ity department. They talk at 
you rather than to or with 
you while they rant on about 
what they know.
Then there are the fans who 
get a kick out of going to the 
ballpark. Regardless of the 
outcome, as long as the game is 
well played, these people are 
happy. The knowledge they 
amass comes through osmosis; 
they become knowledgeable 
because thdy spend time watch
ing and learning the game.
These people study the game 
itself, not just the sports page. I 
consider myself such a fan.
When I was much younger, 
my mother told me that one 
never tries  one either fails or 
succeeds. So, to say that I have 
tried to write a column which 
explored the nature and pur
pose of sports, is wrong. Either I 
have failed or have succeeded. If 
I have failed, then I have mis
judged my audience and overes
timated my ability as a writer.
If I have succeeded, then I must 
work to ensure that I never 
become stagnant in my career 
as a (sports) writer.
Win or lose, I had fun, by God.
Goodbye, farewell, play ball.

The Carnegie Mellon mens ten
nis team demolished its competitiors and set a record in the Presi
dents Athletic Conference cham
pionships Friday and Saturday 
on the Carnegie Mellon campus.
The Tartans made PAC history 
by being the first team ever to 
win every position (one through 
six singles and one through three 
doubles) in the PAC champion
ships.
Head coach Richard Scheines 
was impressed with his teams 
terrific performance in the 
championships. Scheines had 
expected his top three players 
freshman Andrew Lee and jun
iors Haja Rabe and Matt Davis 
to win in the tournament with 
number one, two, and three 
singles, respectively.
Freshman Jeff Blankenship, 
number four for Carnegie Mellon, 
had what was expected to be a 
tough match in the first round 
against an opponent who had 
beaten him earlier in the season. 
Blankenship was able to win the 
first round match and gained 
enough confidence to win the 
number four singles tournament.
Freshman Chris Sheehan, 
number five singles, had one of 
the toughest first round matches 
of all the CMU players. Sheehan 
had broken his racket duringpracDavis ... and Scheines agree that this 
was a good season. The Tartans fin
ished with a record of 8-7, which is 
quite good, considering that they had 
to play seven top 30 Division III 
teams....
tice and had to compete with an 
unfamiliar racket in the tourna
ment.
Losing the first set 0-6, Shee
han switch to another racket and 
rallied to win hisfirst round match 
and the number five position in 
the championship.
The only other close match was 
the number two doubles, Davis 
and junior Mike Ference, in the 
finals.
This was the last match of the 
tournamentand was the match 
that would decided whether or 
not Carnegie Mellon would earn 
the first sweep in PAC champion
ship history. The final score was a 
close 64, 5-7, 6^4 but it was 
enough to obtain the record for 
CMU.
There were several that we 
could have lost, Scheines admit
ted in retrospect. He attributes 
the ability of the team to win so 
solidily to peaking and playing 
well [at the end of the season].
Scheines pointed out the fact
that last year the Tartans won 
the PACs by one point against 
John Carroll, a team they had 
beaten 8-1 in the regular season.
This year Carnegie Mellon 
crushed Grove City in the regular 
season. Grove City came back to 
challenge Carnegie Mellon in 
seven out of the nine finals. Ac
cording to Scheines, last years 
team did not play as well as it did 
in the regular season against John 
Carroll, but this year the Tartans 
were able to raise their level of 
play.
Davis, who is co-captain along 
with Ference, and Scheines agree 
that this was a good season. The 
Tartans finished with a record of 
87, which is quite good, consid
ering that they had to play seven 
top 30 Division III teams, and 
some schools in higher divisions.
Early this week, Lee and Rabe 
will find out whether or not they 
will be given a chance to go to 
nationals and will be given a 
ranking.

Womens Ultimate seeded first at Nationals
By KATIE CULBERTSON
Tartan Sports Editor
A young womens Ultimate 
Frisbee team is making waves in 
the national Ultimate tourna
ment. In only its second year in 
competition in the Ultimate Play
ers Association, the team emerged 
winners of the Mid-Atlantic re
gional and was seeded number
one in the Nationals.
In Saturday and Sundays re
gional games in Princeton, NJ, 
CMU toppled opponent after 
opponent, losing only once. On 
Saturday, CMU beat Towson 
State 12-6, handled the Univer
sity of Pennsylvania 13-5, and 
shut out Drew University 14-0. 
The University of Virginia beat 
CMU 13-8 in the days final game.
Sunday, Carnegie Mellon com
peted in a double elimination 
tournament, facing Towson State 
first, and winning 107. By virtue 
of this win, CMU again played 
the University of Virginia, with a 
more pleasing outcome this time, 
winning 10-6. Because of time 
restrictions, both these games 
were capped, and the first team 
to reach 10 points won.
We did an excellent job against 
Virginia, said senior Rachel 
Noble, who is co-captain along 
with junior Shelley Pressley.
The team has almost a month 
to prepare for Nationals, which 
are Memorial Day weekend in 
Phoenix.
Last year, the team did well 
enough in regionals to advance to 
the finals, but could not go due to
funding problems. This year, 
Noble is optimistic about the 
teams chances at Nationals. We 
should do great, she said. Noble 
is hoping the team places in the 
top five.
CMU will be facing teams from 
all around the country at Nation
als, such as Cornell , University 
of California at Santa Barbara, 
and Kansas State University.
Baseball finishes banner week with 3 wins
D. A. Henderson/Tartan Assistant Darkroom Manager 
CMU third baseman John DAmico beats the throw to first.
By JASON McDONALD
Tartan Assistant Sports Editor
The Carnegie Mellon baseball 
club has come back from a dismal 
0-4 start with a three-game win 
streak.
The club benefited from a pair 
of strong performances by sopho
more pitcher Mike Gess. In the 
more recent of his two starts, Gess 
threw an astounding 174 pitches 
in his 11 innings and drove in the 
winning run as Carnegie Mellon 
beat Penn State-New Kensing
ton, 5-4.
Freshman first baseman Mike 
Fugaro explains the turnaround: 
We have a new coach, and we 
hadnt been able to get outside, so 
were just now starting to pull 
together as a team.
The game started out as a de
fensive struggle due to strong 
pitching and defense by both 
teams. CMU missed several op
portunities, stranding seven run
ners in the first five innings, and 
found itself trailing 1-0 in the 
fifth inning. However, the club

tied the game when freshman 
Fred Edquid stole second, moved 
to third on an overthrow, and 
came home on a single by fresh
man shortstop Joey Mauro.
The New Kensington hitters 
briefly got to Gess in the eighth
inning, scoring three runs. Gess 
gave up five singles in the inning, 
but also watched junior third 
baseman John DAmico and so-jj 
phomore catcher Dave Beliz 
commit errors.

Track says farewell to PAC with a bang
By RUSS SHORKEY
Special to The Tartan
The mens and womens track 
teams both came away victorious 
in the Presidents Athletic Con
ference championships this past 
weekend.
The record temperatures and 
stiff competition werent enough 
to stop the Tartans from claiming 
the title in their final season of 
competition in the PAC. The
overall team score for the men 
was CMU 116, Grove City 89, 
Thiel 56, Bethany 19, andW&J 4.
As usual, the majority of the 
Tartans points came from an 
extraordinary performance in the 
distance events. The team was 
able to finish first, second, third 
in the 1500 meters, 5000 meters, 
and 10,000 meters and first-second-fourth in the 800 scoring a 
total of 51 points.
Senior distance runner Dave
Supp was the only double winner 
from the mens team, winning the 
1500 and 5000 meters. In the 1500 
Supp was followed by senior Len 
ONeal in second and freshman 
Brad Shapiro in third. In the 
5000, Supp was followed by sopho
more John Byrnes and senior 
Gary Meeker who were second 
and third. The 800-meter run of 
junior Gary Harrison, Shapiro and 
ONeal was one of the most excit
ing races of the day. ONeal won
the event, followed by Harrison 
in second and Shapiro in fourth.
The 10,000 meters, which is the 
longest and most grueling event 
in track, was dominated by CMU. 
Senior Tim Berger won the event 
followed by junior Todd Balbera 
and freshman Benji Keyes in sec
ond and third.
The CMU sprinting and hur
dling squad also contributed a 
great deal to the Tartan win. 
Although they were unable to
produce an individual champion 
there was very many fine individ
ual performances. Senior Rich 
Shipley, Chris MacGuire, and 
freshman Sean Pempel were able, 
to finish second in the 110-meter 
hurdles, 100-meters, and the 400- 
meter hurdles, respectively.
Going into the championships 
the weakest aspect of the teajm 
was the field events. However,- 
the field squad put together a

St. Vincent knocks CMU out of lacrosse tourney
By STEPHEN KANG
Tartan Staffwriter
The CMU lacrosse team par
ticipated in the St. Vincent roundrobin tournament Sunday. The 
team met its old nemesis, Wash
ington and Jefferson, in the first 
round. Last time these two teams 
| squared off, CMU beat W&J in
 over time.
Looking for revenge, Washing
ton and Jefferson came out strong, 
playing a very physical game.
I.Since the tournament required 
[ieach team to play without much 
I rest, the game was being played 
-on the running time of 15-minute
 quarters. In the first two quar
ters, both teams struggled on of;fense, going into halftime tied at
 three. Then, in the fourth quar
ter, CMU overcame W&J, physically out-running and out-hustling for the loose balls. Winning 
6-4, Carnegie Mellon advanced 
to the next round of play.
Scoring for CMU in the first 
game included Phil Kessler with 
".three, Bayard Johnson with one, 
.and freshman Brendan Janishefski with one. Helping on the
Despite CMUs comeback,
St. Vincent, who was not only accus
tomed to its home field, but also had 
more rest for its starters, eventually 
won 7-5.
offense were Scott Johnson, who 
had an assist. Senior goalie Peter 
Vonderlieth had twelve saves for 
the game.
After taking a brief break in the 
locker room, CMU moved to an
other field to compete against 
tough St. Vincent, who defeated 
Allegheny in the first round. Thus, 
the trophy would go to the winner 
between CMU and St.Vincent.
Despite the hard-played first 
quarter, St.Vincent was on top 
3-1 with the home crowd at its 
side. Here, the game began to fall 
apart, as penalty after penalty 
was called on CMU. In fact, at 
one stretch of the game, CMU 
played two men down for more 
than two minutes. Bombardedby 
shot after shot, Vonderlieth took
matters into his own hands dur
ing one play and jumped on the 
St.Vincentattackman outsidethe 
crease. Soon, the tempers flared 
and the referees were sending 
players from both teams to the 
penalty box.
Not giving up, CMU compen
sated for the injury-ridden de
fense by playing Scott Johnson at 
both middie with a short stick 
and defense with a long stick.
In the fourth quarter, fighting 
both game clock and St.Vincent, 
CMU came back in a quick way by 
scoring four goals in a row. Scott 
Johnson had one goal, freshman 
Miguel Triay had two goals, and 
junior Rob Kendall had two goals 
in the second game. In the assist 
category, Triay had one and Phil
Kessler had two.
Despite CMUs comeback, 
St.Vincent, who was not only 
accustomed to its home field, but 
also had more rest forits starters, 
eventually won 7-5. After the 
game, the CMU players agreed 
that consisitency was the key to 
winning the whole tournament. 
For whatever reason, Carnegie 
Mellon did not come out as strong 
against St.Vincent as it did 
against Washington and Jeffer
son.
One of the highlights of the tour
nament was a quick-stick shot by 
Phil Kessler against W&J on the 
fast break play. Kessler caught 
the ball with his back against the 
goal and managed to get a clear 
shot off. In addition, Kendall had 
a highlight of his own when he 
scored against St.Vincent and at 
the same sustained a groin injury 
and had to come off the field.
Overall, a young CMU team 
still trying to find chemistry fared 
well in the tournament. For the 
season, CMU has three wins and 
four losses. Next weeks game is 
scheduled to be played Saturday 
at Bethany.

Special to The Tartan
; The University Rowing Club 
competed in Bucknell Universitys 
annual regatta in Lewisburgh, PA 
this weekend.Besides CMU, both 
University of Pittsburgh and
 Duquesne were the local univer
sities in the 13-team field.
Although CMU made quite a 
showing this weekend, the 
weather marred its performance, 
as two CMU crews were not able 
to race because of wind condi
tions.
In the first part of the day, 
despite scorching temperatures 
of near 90 degrees, the CMU crew 
completed several impressive
races. Some highlights:
The Mens Heavyweight Var
sity Four placed second in its heat 
of four, qualifying it for the finals. 
In the finals, with six boats com
peting, the men placed third, with 
a time of 4:25.35, only a half a 
second behind second-place Mercyhurst.
After placing second in its heat
as well, the Mens Novice Eight 
placed third overall among, six 
boats in the finals, with a time of 
4:26.55.
The Womens Varsity Four 
impressed everyone with a first 
place finish in its heat of five, and 
second place overall, with a time 
of 3:51.20. Times for these three 
races are not comparable due to
floating starts and wind changes.
In the afternoon, the wind 
picked up, causing very rough 
water  a couple of boats were 
swamped. The races were delayed 
until the wind died down. An hour 
later, crews went back out on the 
water, racing a shorter course of 
1200 meters, cut down from an 
original 2000 meters.
Unfortunately, just as the 
Womens Novice Eight was about 
to race, the wind picked up again 
and officials were forced to cancel 
the rest of the races. Both Mens 
Heavyweight Eight and Womens 
Novice Eight did not race.
Next weekend, the crew team 
travels to Columbus, OH to race 
in another annual regatta.

DAmico and Beltz would make up for their mistakes 
in their very next at-bats. Beltz led off the bottom of 
the eighth with a double and scored on a Gess single 
one out later.
DAmico then hit a double of his own to knock Gess 
in. DAmico would advance to third on a wild pitch, but 
was unable to score.
Gess struck out the side in the top of the ninth, 
setting the stage for a Carnegie Mellon comeback in 
the bottom of the inning. Sophomore left fielder Mike 
JPetrich singled to lead off the inning, and Mauro 
reached base on an error.
After a sacrifice by senior center fielder Warren Flax 
moved the runners to second and third, New Kensing
ton handed Carnegie Mellon the game on a silver plat
ter.
Beltz was hit by a pitch, loading the bases for 
Fugaro, who drew a walk to force the tying run home. 
Unfortunately, Carnegie Mellon stranded the remain
ing runners, and the game went to extra innings tied 
4-4.
The winning run was also helped along by an error. 
Mauro doubled to lead off the bottom of the eleventh, 
and Flax, attempting to sacrifice, reached on an error. 
Beltz and Fugaro were retired, and Gess came to the 
plate to hit his game-winning single.
We shouldnt have had to go to extra innings, said 
DAmico. We just made a couple of bad plays.
The baseball club traveled to Waynesburgon Wednes
day to make up a game postponed from earlier in the 
season.
The club got strong pitching from junior Matt 
Pampena and came away with an 8-3 win.
Carnegie Mellon got off to a good start, scoring three 
runs in the top of the first inning. Petrich and Mauro 
walked, setting the table for a two-run double by Flax. 
Flax would score later on in the inning to give Carne

Waynesburg scored two runs in its half of the first 
inning, and one more in the fourth to tie the game at 
three; however, CMU took the lead for good in the top 
of the sixth.
DAmico and Edquid reached base and were driven 
in when freshman second baseman Satoru Yamaguchi 
drilled a three-run homer. In the seventh, CMU added 
a pair of insurance runs when Flax homered.
In other action, CMU beat Penn State-McKeesport

Rugby ties in seasons end
By TOMANFUSO
Special to The Tartan
Carnegie Mellons rugby squad took 
the battle halfway across the state last 
Saturday, only to be disappointed in a 
6-6 tie against Penn State-Altoona.
The teams opposing scrums fought 
tooth and nail for ball possession as 
the backfield stood by, ready for action 
that seldom came. Rugby president 
junior John Lucena commented, Were 
a fast team, and we need some room to 
open up our lines if we want to get the 
ball downfield.
However, the outfinessed scrum re
peatedly lost crucial line-outs, giving 
Altoona excellent field position thorughoutthegame. CMU seniors Mark 
Wabalas and Riz Dagli helped to stabi
lize a generally haphazard defensive 
game plan with strong, well-timed 
tackles. The game stood scoreless at 
halftime.
Early in the second-half, fly-halfDom 
Ianno led a frenzied attack through 
Altoona defenders. Ripping free of at
least a dozen tackles, the senior booted 
the ball upfield where two Altoona 
players leaped for the ball and bru
tally collided in midair.
The ball popped into the hands of 
Lucena who sprinted across the tryline, unopposed. Sure-footed Gerry 
Stocker followed the try with a pointsafter kick, setting the score at 6-0. 
Carnegie Mellon failed to seize hold of 
game momentum as Altoona re
doubled their offensive efforts.
After a penalty, Altoona got the ball 
inches from the CMU tiy-line on a 
penalty. The Altoona scrum lunged 
through the Carnegie Mellon defense 
on a questionable play. Despite CMU 
protests that the ball had never been 
kicked through the penalty mark 
(which the rules demand) the referees 
call stood, and an Altoona points-after kick tied the game at 6-6.
Missinga difficult penalty kick that 
would have won the game, Carnegie 
Mellons ruggers were unable to rally 
back in the remaining ten minutes of 
play.
Track leaves PAC a winner
only allowed seven hits as Carnegie Mellon coasted to victory.
The baseball club has six games remaining on its spring schedule, 
starting with todays game against Butler Community College.

great performance with two individual 
champions. Freshman Scott Foster fin
ished first in the long jump and sopho
more Jeff Palima finished first in the 
pole vault.
The women won their first ever PAC 
championship with a score of 64 points 
followed by Grove city with 54 points, 
Thiel with 44, and Bethany with 19.
The women distance runners were the 
most dominant competitors in the meet. 
Sophomore Carolyn Lowe, who was voted 
the meet MVP, won the 1500,5000, and 
3000 meters. Lowe was complimented 
in the distance events by Junior Kristin 
Burgard who finished second in the 1500 
and 5000 meters. Also, freshman Laura 
Sibley who finished third in the 3000 and 
fourth in the 5000.
Junior Lisa Schmidt complimented' 
the distance performance with two sec
ond place finishes in the 200 and 400 and 
a win in the high jump.
Other fine performances for the 
Tartans include senior Jody Bungs sec-" 
ond place in the 100, sophomore Carolyn" 
Woyciesjes second place in the 400' 
hurdles, and sophomore Lois Raskas 
second in the 800 and third in the 400.
This year marked the final year ofl 
competition for the Tartans in the PAC: 
Although both teams were very happy 
with their performances the general 
consensus was they were happy to be our 
of the PAC so they can concentrate their 
efforts on the more competitive UAA" 
conference. The mensand womens team' 
are both looking forward to a promising 
future and more championship teams.

The Claymore is a two-handed sword used by the early Scotsmen to overcome all opposition; it is the 
symbol for all those who must cut past all obstaces standing in the way of their aims. The Claymore 
Clan is organized to recognize those who, through daily association and their interest in residence life 
activities, have shown: leadership, not only in the residence halls but in the campus as a whole; 
personal integrity, as applied to both curricular and extra-cirricular activities; cooperation, in a 
worthy project sponsored by another person or organization; and interest, in the ideals and purposes 
of the Claymore Clan. The Claymore Clan shall recognize and promote fellowship, scholarship and 
service among the students of the residence life system.
The Claymore Clan is supported by the Student Dormitory Council and the Carnegie Mellon Housing
Office.
IM closes out 1989-90 year
The intramural department 
ended the 1989-90 year with its 
annual dinner. The highlight of 
the evening was the election of 
senior Pat Jeffries as the IM 
Person of the Year.
The Person of the Year award is 
voted on by members of the IM 
board. Jeffries, in his second year 
as president of the board, has won 
the award each of the last three 
years.
Pat has been a really great 
leader, said Earl Birdy, CMUs 
director for intramural athletics. 
He represented the program well,
and he was a professional and 
orderly president.
Birdy also saluted the board for 
one of the best years in the his
tory of the program. He cited 
increased participation and bet
ter officiating as the highlights of 
this years program.
Finally, Birdy mentioned the 
fact that other University Ath
letic Association schools are inter
ested in patterning their IM pro
grams after Carnegie Mellons.
Our program is really unique, 
said Birdy. The students have a 
lot more input than they do at 
other schools. Thats why its a 
success.
Phi Kap runs for charity
Phi Kappa Theta fraternity ran 
this weekend to raise money for 
the Big Brothers and Big Sisters

solicited people to pledge a cer
tain amount of money per each 
mile a person ran. Donations were 
also accepted.
According to senior Peter 
Pezaris, the projects chairman,! 
as of Sunday, the fraternity had 
collectively run 200 miles, and he 
hoped for as many more by Mon
day. Every brother has partici
pated and run at least one mile, 
said Pezaris.

Volume 84, Issue 24The Tartan. Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania1 May 1990
PJ. ORourke speaks about his 'Holidays in Heir
By KEVIN BARNEY
Tartan Features Editor
Kids with lavender hair, New Age 
goofs, drunk war vets in wheelchairs, 
video-burgeoned tourists, Deadheads, 
gays, art students forgetting to look cool
 and bored ... Is this a description of 
Carnegie Mellon or what?
Actually this was part of a lecture 
given by Rolling Stones International 
Editor P.J. ORourke last Wednesday be
fore a sparse crowd gathered in the Skibo 
'Ballroom.
Entitled Holidays in Hell ORourkes 
lecture centered upon the vacations that 
he had taken in the past few years while 
writing for Rolling Stone. The first one a 
trip to Beirut, which he took back in a
11 time when the safest flights to take 
were those to Beirut, because all other 
flights were being hijacked.
On the flight over, ORourke talked 
about playing the game Whos the Hi
jacker? This game involves trying to 
} pick out the hijacker amongst the pas
sengers. It wasnt the short guy who 
looked like Danny DeVito and it cer
tainly wasnt the mother with the three 
kids.
ORourke described his attire as the 
 standard outfit for the CIA; blue blazer, 
necktie, and horn-rimmed glasses. The 
advantage to this outfit was that he 
could get things done when others 
couldnt.
One instance where his attire came in 
j handy was near a checkpoint. He walked 
up to the guard after cutting through the 
line of angry people. At the checkpoint 
the guard let him through, because he
"My tax dollars paid for that gun. My tax dollars paid for his boots. My tax dollars paid for 
his uniform....
 Rolling Stone's International Editor P.J.
O'Rourke while looking down a machine gun 
_________________barrel pointed in his direction
looked CIA
After passing through the checkpoint, 
a sergeant with a machine gun 50 meters 
up a hill, waved him up. As ORourke 
walked up the hill, with the gun pointed 
at him, he kept thinking my tax dollars 
paid for that gun. My tax dollars paid for 
his boots. My tax dollars paid for his 
uniform.... and so on. On top of the hill, 
the sergent talked to him for a few min
utes before letting him continue with his 
journey.
His other adventures in Beirut include 
staying in a Holiday Inn which was so 
riddled with holes that it looked like 
Swiss cheese. It was kind of cool, cause 
I spend a lot of time in Holiday Inns and 
who doesnt want to beat the shit out of 
them.
Next, ORourke discussed his trip to 
the Berlin Wall. Several days after the 
Wall was taken down, ORourke arrived 
on the scene to see people partying and 
celebrating.
According to ORourke, everyone at 
the Wall was happy. A British guy who 
could have been off strangling Belgian 
soccer fans, came up to me, and said, I 
fucking ad to see this, right? 
Certain events ORourke experienced 
in Berlin brought home the oppression 
that had existed in East Berlin before 
the Wall had fallen. ORourke compared 
this trip to one he had taken several 
years earlier.
One day he was waiting for the walk 
sign to light up. A crowd of people were 
also waiting. Out of habit, ORourke 
crossed before the light had changed and 
the entire crowd followed him. A truck 
came roaring by and he jumped back to 
the curb, again followed by the crowd. 
From this experience, ORourke learned 
that no one would do something without 
some sort of leader.
On his second trip to East Berlin, 
ORourke noticed some obvious changes 
due to the fact that we the people, the 
free and equal citizens of democracies... 
tore a new asshole in International 
Communism.
One of the most obvious changes 
ORourke dealt with was that the taxi 
drivers saw my luggage andbegan shout
ing, You want taxi? "Taxi, ja? Imagine 
shouting that your services are for hire 
in East Berlin. Imagine shouting. Imag
ine services.
Thomas Nichols/Tartan Photo Editor 
Rolling Stone International Editor PJ. O'Rourke speaks about his Holidays In Hell 
to a sparse crowd in the Ballroom.
It was the decision and the gamble 
to move ahead and develop a com
puter network on campus that actu
ally has turned out to be the most im
portant decision I ever made. 
___________ President Richard Cyert
Thomas Nichols/Tartan Photo Editor 
President Richard Cyert gives one of his many speeches to the campus community.
Cyerts years as dean was the 
raising of $10 million to start a 
school of public administration, 
thereby establishing SUPA.
Cyerts rise from dean to presi
dent was boosted by his excellent 
relationship with Carnegie 
Mellons people. Guy Stever re
signed to become the director of 
the National Science Foundation, 
said Cyert. A search committee 
was formed, and I became a can
didate for the job. I interviewed
with faculty, trustees, alumni, and 
students, and I had good support 
from each one of those groups. 
While we looked outside the uni
versity at a large number of 
people, these groups tended to 
focus on me as the best candi
date.
After ten years as dean of GSIA, 
Cyert became president of Carne
gie Mellon in 1972.
One of Cyerts first objectives 
was to establish a direction and a
purpose through extended inter
action with Carnegie Mellons 
faculty. I had a set of goals, but 
they were broad sorts of goals. I 
put the university onto a strate
gic planning process and formed 
an advisory committee of faculty 
members. I had the deans and de
partment heads present their 
strategic plans to this committee. 
Out of those strategic plans, I set 
up a goal statement for this uni
versity containing a lot of the goals
and conditions that I wanted to 
achieve and maintain at Carne
gie Mellon.
Cyert admits that he could not 
achieve everything he set out to 
accomplish. Nobody ever attains 
all the goals that he or she estab
lishes, he said. I had hoped that
I was going to get a university 
center, but I did not have enough 
time. Ive raised $27 million for it, 
and theres another fourteen to 
go.
However, Cyert is considerably 
pleased with what he has 
achieved. In general, I would say 
that Ive been tremendously grati
fied and satisfied with the things 
that weve attained at Carnegie 
Mellon. My biggest overall aim 
was to make Carnegie Mellon rec
ognized as a great institution, and 
that has certainly been accom
plished.
Cyert credits that recognition 
to the people of CMU. The real 
reason weve been able to attain 
such great prominence has been 
the dedication and commitment 
of faculty members and the ad
ministration. Weve hired very 
bright people, weve improved the 
quality of the student body, and 
weve had outstanding public 
relations and very strong devel
opment operations for raising 
additional money. Carnegie Mel
lon has had a real team effort, 
and, as a result, we have what I 
think is a tremendous reputation 
for a university.
That reputation could not have 
been achieved if Cyert had not 
been able to take a deficit-ridden 
university and turn it into a fi
nancially sound institution. The 
three years previous to my be
coming president, the university 
had run deficits, he said. The 
first budget that I inherited back
in 1972 was $750,000 in deficit. 
In that year, we cut expenses 
further, we raised additional 
money, and we wound up, at the 
end of that academic year, with a 
$150,000 surplus. Weve been in 
the black every year since. 
Cyert attributes Carnegie 
Mellons rise to financial solvency 
to better management. [The rise] 
has been through watching ex
penses carefully, forcing people 
to live within their budgets, and 
raising a large amount of outside 
funds. Weve tripled the endow
ment, for example; its three times 
as large as when I became presi
dent. Were raising money at a 
rate now that we never dreamed 
possible back in 1972.
Cyert had to make a vast num
ber of decisions to achieve Carne
gie Mellons financial strength 
and powerful reputation. But one 
decision stands out above the rest' 
It was the decision and the 
gamble to move ahead and de
velop a computer network on 
campus that actually has turned 
out to be the most important' 
decision I ever made, he said.
However, not all of Cyerts deci
sions have been that easy to real
ize. I wouldnt put it as a single 
decision, but I would say, as a 
class of decisions, my hardest 
decisions have been to fire people. 
Ive had to fire a fair number of 
people over the years, and not a 
single one of them was easy. 
Another difficult decision Cyert 
has had to make was to remove 
Carnegie Mellons chapter of Zeta 
Beta Tau in January 1985. It 
was a hard decision, admitted 
Cyert. On the other hand, they 
had done so many things that had 
warranted it that I felt I had no 
alternative. That was a difficult

I Tartan Staffwriter
Richard M. Cyert, the sixth 
president of Carnegie Mellon, is 
[retiring from the presidency at 
jxhe end of this academic year. In 
an interview last Friday, Cyert 
described what the last eighteen 
years as president was like, giv
ing the students of Carnegie 
| Mellon a look through the eyes of 
^aii internationally noted econo
mist and management theorist, 
and more importantly, a man who 
has devoted almost forty years of 
his life to Carnegie Mellon.
Cyert, 68, and his wife, Marga
ret, have been Carnegie Mellons 
presidential family since 1972. 
They have three daughters: Lynn, 
Cindy, and Martha.
After earning his PhD from Co
lumbia University and a 
bachelors degree from the Uni
versity of Minnesota, Cyert joined 
Carnegie Mellon in 1948 as an 
instructor of economics. I started 
as. an instructor, not even a fac
ulty member; I was at the bot
tom, said Cyert. Hardly anyone 
rdoes that anymore. He later 
! became head of the department of 
Industrial Management.
Cyert became dean of GSIA 
when George Leland Bach, the 
[ first dean of the school, resigned 
ptor health reasons. We looked 
outside the university for people 
to become the dean. There was a 
lot of strong support for me, par
ticularly among the assistant 
professors and the associate pro
cessors with whom I had worked 
frequently. Eventually, I indi
cated I was willing [to become 
dean] if we couldnt get someone 
from the outside. As it turned out, 
we couldnt get any other candi
dates who satisfied everybody, so 
I finally agreed to be the dean.
During his term as dean of 
GSIA, Cyert, along with Jim 
M;arch, published Behavioral 
Theory of the Firm, which is con
sidered a landmark work in the 
fields of ecomonics, behavioral 
science, and management. The 
book earned a Citation Classic 
honor from the Institute of Scien
tific Information.

Grandpa unveils the truth behind the White Burger
Editors Note: Pennsylvania Bill 
and Kevin Bernstein are fictional 
beer connoisseurs travelling 
around the world reviewing beers 
from various countries.
This week, I, being Kevin Bern
stein, Will recount the tale of how 
Pennsylvania Bill and I discov
ered the secret behind the White 
Burger, We were in Cleveland 
. with folir dead Ponch DiWeasal 
1 gents, our dog, and our quest.
I suggested that we get the 
Greyhound bus moving again. We 
did. The bus started rolling down 
the road like snot on a kids face in 
the winter. We arrived at Pitts
burgh \yhere we decided to get 
out.
We departed and walked the 
four blocks to PA Bills house, the 
one where his grandfather died. 
We got there and immediately 
went to the fridge. Inside there 
were two beers. Both were 
Straubs. I had never heard of 
them, neither had Pennsylvania, 
even though it was brewed in St. 
Marys, Pennsylvania. We popped 
them open.
AROUND THE WORLD 
IN EIGHTY BEERS
by Kevin Barney & 
William Burky
Smells like beer. PA Bill took 
a swig.
Tastes like beer, with a slight 
touch of ... mineral water? I 
wondered aloud so that others 
could hear me. Why else would 
someone wonder aloud. You dont 
want to wonder aloud when you 
dont want people to hear you. 
Would you ever wonder aloud, 
Damn, shes got nice ... Do you 
understand, yet? When a person 
wonders aloud, that person wants 
to be heard, but tries to fool every
one around him.
Were you wondering aloud? 
PA Bill asked.
Yeah, sorry. I guess it still 
works on some people.
I was wondering if you tasted 
the faint mineral water flavor?
Exactly. Did you know that 
this beer is brewed from fresh 
mountain spring water and it has 
no preservatives.
Nature beer?
What an idea! Beer that is 
healthyforyou!Iexclaimed. Can 
you imagine going to the club, 
working out, and then instead of 
having prune juice, you can pop 
open a natural beer. This idea 
was great!
And it tastes good, too. Penn
sylvania finished his beer and 
wished, aloud, that he had an
other.
I agreed. Its a shame that you 
only had two beers left.
De repente, ... (Sorry, sudden 
relapse into Spanish, lets try this 
again.)
Suddenly, the door opened and 
in walked an old man!
Grandpa! PA Bill shouted.
Grandson. How you doing, 
kiddo? he put down his bag of 
groceries.

I thought that you had died. 
Pennsylvania ran into his 
grandfathers arms. His grandfa
ther had tears in his eyes and 
beers in the grocery bag. We all 
popped open some beers and sat 
down to start drinking.
Well, Uge... Pennsylvania 
interrupted his grandfather by 
jumping up and screaming.
My name is Pennsylvania!!!! 
Dont call me that!!!!
Silence fell across the room like 
an overweight person passing out.
Grandpa sat down and popped 
open a beer. Well, what have you 
been up to?
Pennsylvania s at up in his chair, 
Weve been looking for that White
Burger that you told me about. 
Grandpa laughed as he finished 
his beer. Foam went up and came 
out of his nose. After relaxing and 
drying up the spilled beer (or 
abused alcohol as we call it) 
Grandpa explained why he had 
laughed. I told you that story 
because you said that you wanted 
to hear a story and ... well ... I 
didnt remember how Goldilocks 
and the Three Bears ended, so I 
made up the story of The White 
Burger.
So, I spent the last half an hour 
travelling around the world look
ing for this stupid burger and now 
youre telling me that you made it 
up.
Im fraid so, sonny.
Pennsylvania Bill ran over to 
his grandfather and they both 
started crying. I, in turn, started 
weeping also. But then I always 
weep when my beer is empty.

A persons opinion
Every year, at the end of the 
spring semester, The Tartan 
editoral board gets together and 
dcids to give out thistles and 
thorns.
Thistles go out to those people 
and groups who did things that 
were beneficial or good for the 
campus community. A thistle is 
simply a gold star, a small 
reward for a good deed.
Aihorngoesouttothosepeople 
or groups that have really 
screwed things up or have done 
something that hurts someone 
in some way. A thorn is the dunce 
cap, something that reminds the 
, campus community of the bad 
..deed.
.... This year, we went out and 
~ asked members of the campus 
community who they would give 
thistles and thorns to.
Other thistles and thorns can 
be fund on the Forum pages.
John Wiedey 
Sophomore, CIT
A thorn goes to Professor Wyler 
in the mathematics department, 
just look at his ratings. A thistle 
would go to AB for having Oingo 
Boingo at Carnival.
Richard Cyert
President of Carnegie Mellon
I would only give thistles. One 
to Pat Keating for all his work on 
the University Center and one to 
Mary Ann Rorison for taking care 
of me for 18 years of presidency.
Kathy Iovine 
Freshman, CIT
Wed give Joshua Lynn a thistle 
for outstanding performance as 
technical advisor for AB Tech.

A thorn to the humidity and a 
thistle to all the girls in shorts.

Ballroom dancing swings 
back into action at CMU
By AYAMI OGURA
~Special to The Tartan
The CMU Ballroom Dance 
Competition Team attended its 
first collegiate competition at Ohio 
State University last Saturday. 
- 'The members of the team com: peted in both team and individ
ual heats in dances such as foxtrot, 
Itango, waltz, quickstep, swing, 
[ cha cha, and rumba.
Vi The CMU team was pitted 
against top-ranked teams from 
the University of Illinois and 
Notre Dame University as well as 
teams from Ohio State, the Uni
versity of Kentucky, and Indiana 
University in this regional cham
pionship. The CMU international 
style team proved itself quite an
oppenent against the more expe
rienced teams, coming in fifth 
place in the team competitions. 
Only two points kept the team 
from clinching fourth.
In the individual heats, all CMU 
team members made it to the 
semi-finals rounds and a few went 
onto the finals. The final scores 
for the CMU team included one 
first place finish, one second place 
finish, three third place finishes, 
a fourth place finish and a sixth 
place finish.
Coach Mary Kellner was very 
pleased with the teams first out
ing and will be continuing to work 
with the team members to pre
pare for future competitions. She 
is currently planning a collegiate 
competition to be hosted by CMU
this fall.
The CMU Ballroom Dance 
Competition Team grew out of 
the CMU Ballroom Dance Club 
which was started in 1989 to 
promote ballroom dancing within 
the CMU community. The club 
provides social dance instruction 
for all CMU students, staff, and 
faculty. Currently, the club con
sists of about 65 members and 
membership is growing every 
semester.
The CMU team is currently 
preparing for an international 
competition in London.
Anyone interested in the ball
room dance club or team can

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  1 May 1990
The Astronomy Club gazes through the 
heavenly sky in search of Comet Austin

Tartan Asst. Features Editor
For most students here at CMU, the 
phrase late night, brings to mind 
thoughts of stress, anxiety, and lots of 
cramming. But for members of Carnegie 
Mellon University Astronomy Club, late 
night means a chance to gaze at the 
heavenly bodies.
On Friday, the expedition group met 
at 11:30 pm in Doherty Hall 2304. Once 
they were assembled, astronomy equip
ment was packed into the trunk of a car. 
Among the equipment taken was the 
clubs Celestron C-8a $1000 telescope 
with an eight inch mirror which provides 
magnifications from 50 to 350 times, 
depending on the eyepiece used. This 
months celestial target was Comet 
Austin.
Comet Austin was discovered last year 
in December by New Zealand amateur 
astronomer Rodney Austin. What makes 
the comet so special is the fact that it is 
the brightest comet to be seen in our sky 
since Comet West in 1976.
After a one hour drive down to Green 
County to a farm located near the border 
of Pennsylvania and West Virginia, the 
group of amateur astronomers perused
the skies. The.farms owner, Dana Wilson, 
lets the club 1'jise a portion of his farm as 
a view site V^here the club can escape 
from bright lights and pollution of the 
city.
Not bad, except for the trees blocking 
the view, said the clubs president sen
ior Erol Caglarcan. A grove of trees were 
originally in the way of the comets path, 
so the equipment was moved.
It was around three in the morning 
when everything was finally set up. The 
comet would not be visible until a few 
hours later, so the group looked at some 
other interesting objects first.
Among the objects seen were the An
dromeda Galaxy (M31), two globular 
clusters (Ml 3 and M22), the Lagoon 
Nebula (M8), the Trifid Nebula (M20), 
two open clusters (M6 and M7), the 
Whirlpool Galaxy (M51), and a ring neb
ula in Lyra (M57).
Each nebulous object has a number 
given to it. These numbers were assigned 
and compiled into the Messier catalog by 
Charles Messier in the eighteenth cen
tury. Both comets and nebulous objects 
appear as fuzzy white areas, but comets 
move in and out of the visible night sky 
whereas nebulous objects remain rela
tively stationary. Comets can be distin
guished from nebulous objects by seeing 
whether or not they are in the catalog.
Saturn and Venus were also visible 
that morning. Venus, the Morning Star, 
could be seen by the naked eye as the 
morning approached. Looking through 
the telescope, Saturns rings were very 
bright.
As Comet Austin came into view, the 
group took turns looking through the 
telescope to catch a glimpse of it in the 
Andromeda Galaxy. The comet was in
deed very visible despite some clouds 
that were in the way. The triangular tail 
of the comet could be seen pointing away 
from the direction of the sun. A camera 
was mounted onto the telescope and a 
bulb exposure picture was taken to com
memorate the occasion.
The group was made up of both expe
rienced viewers and newcomers. The nov
ices saw their first comet ever and the 
others saw the brightest comet in over a 
decade. All in all, it was a very good 
night. Our goal is to teach people about 
the night sky, said Caglarcan, Theres 
a lot of stuff out there that people dont 
know about. Away from the cities, CMU, 
and the stress, the quietly beautiful night 
sky was a welcome change for the small 
group of student astronomers.
Cyert plans to teach again and considers writing an autobiography
continued from page LI
decision. It affected a lot of stu
dents, a lot of alumni, amTtrus\$ees.
;!; Despite the Zeta Beta Taudeci"sion, Cyert recognizes Carnegie 
'Mellons fraternities as a vital 
social outlet. Ive always felt that 
.. our fraternity system is different 
from fraternities at large schools 
that have big football teams and 
' so on, remarked Cyert. I think 
bur students are more serious. I 
think social events like Spring 
: Carnival and Homecoming would 
' be very difficult to have if we did 
not have the fraternities.
 However, Cyert does not think 
the fraternities are the only im
portant social outlet on campus. 
T have supported the growth of 
independents like the Pioneers,
which I think is very good, he 
added. I think we should have 
both kinds of groups.
In addition to the fraternities, 
Cyert respects groups represent
ing minority students. I feel a 
university has to be a place where 
diverse cultures can exist to
gether. I am strongly in favor of 
helping to create an environment 
in which people of minority views
 whether theyre political, 
whether theyre racial groups, 
whether theyre sexual orienta
tion groupsI believe all of these 
people have a right to exist on this 
campus and should be respected 
by all the other groups. Cultural 
diversity should be something 
that is the goal of every student at 
Carnegie Mellon.
In retrospect, Cyert is satisfied
I want to be known as the president 
who cared for the institution and for 
all the people in it....
 President Richard Cyert
with what he has accomplished, 
although he wishes he could have 
done even more. Im happy with 
the way we have proceeded. I wish 
we could have increased the en
dowment even more than we have, 
but we put so much money into 
the physical plant that it was 
difficult to do that. I also would 
have liked to have built a per
forming arts center.
Cyert is proud of the enhance
ment of Carnegie Mellons repu
tation that has occurred under 
his presidency. I wish to be 
remembered as the president who 
took Carnegie Mellon from being 
a regionally well-known univer
sity to being an internationallyknown university. I want to be 
known as the president who cared 
for the institution and for all the 
people in it; who cared for stu
dents, who cared for faculty, who 
tried to do whatever he could... to 
make life better for students and
for faculty, and to make the whole 
institution much more produc
tive.
After his retirement from the 
presidency, Cyert will continue to 
be a major component of the 
Carnegie Mellon organization. 
Im going to become faculty 
member, a professor again, he 
noted. Ill be in GSIA, but Ill also 
be in SUPA. Im intendingto teach 
and do research, and I will be 
running the Bosch Institute.
Cyert will also continue to 
publish books and articles. But 
what about an autobiography? 
The idea has passed through my 
head, admitted Cyert. I dont 
know if Ill ever do it or not. I dont 
know whether anyone else would 
be interested in my life, particu
larly five years from now, when
Im long past being president, but 
possibly.
As he bids farewell to the presi
dency, Cyert would also like to 
thank the students and give them 
one last message. I would say to 
the students that I hope thy 
realize that I and other people in 
Warner Hall do care for the stu
dents here, and particularly for 
the undergraduates. We realize 
that this school exists primarily 
for the undergraduates and ; I 
believe that everybody in the ad
ministration and the faculty has 
to remember the importance of 
undergraduate students. I believe 
that if the university continues to 
act in a caring manner for under
graduates then Carnegie Mellon 
will continue to prosper and be a 
great institution.

L4The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  1 May 1990
Michael Ondaajtee reads at Adamson Awards
By TRUPTI PATEL
Tartan Staffwriter
The ninth annual Adamson 
Awards Ceremony commenced at
8 pm Friday in the appropriately 
named Adamson Wing located in 
Baker Hall.
The awards were sponsored by 
the Carnegie Mellon English De
partment and presented to un
dergraduates for outstanding 
achievement in poetry, fiction, and 
non-fiction.
Master of Ceremonies Margot 
Livesey, a member of the English 
Department faculty, charmed a 
standing room only audience in 
the Adamson Wing with her 
humorous comments throughout 
the evening. Livesey began the 
evening by introducing depart
ment head Alan Kennedy who 
proceeded to welcome the packedhouse to the Adamson Awards.
Livesey then introduced criti

Michael Ondaatje, the special 
guest for the evening. Ondaatje''

sented numerous readings to the 
audience concerning humorous as 
well as highly emotional incidents 
from his own life. In addition, 
Ondaatje gave quiet but expres
sive readings of his fictional work.
Ondaatjes work touched a wide 
range of emotion within the audi
ence. His metaphorical poem 
Sweet Like a Crow elicited 
heartfelt laughter from the audi
ence, while the poignancy of The 
Cinnamon Peeler left the audi
ence silent. Ondaatje read five 
poems altogether. Moreover, he 
read passages from a personal 
memoir entitled Running in the 
Family. The author closed out the 
reading with passages from his 
last novel entitled Skin of the 
Lamb. Ondaatje was enormously 
popular with the audience and
was given a tremendous round of 
applause.

Id love to draw a comic for The Tartan, but I just dont have the time.
Have, you been saying this all semester?
Well, now is your chance. You have all summer to create, script and draw your very own comic strip.
When you come back to school in the Fall, you can sit back, relax and leisurely turn in youi comic each week while all those other artists are furiously trying to create their comics amid all the chaos of CMU.
Sounds great, huh?Questions? Don't hesitate to ask.
Just call The Tartan  x2111 and ask for Bill Sabram

EXCELLENT ADVENTURE
Sequels overwhelm 
the movie industry
By STEPHEN GLICKER
Tartan Diversions Editor
Around ten years ago Holly
wood discovered something that 
has since changed movie history 
the movie sequel. It discovered 
that people will pay good money 
to see their favorite, movie char
acters again, and again, and 
again.... Ever since Star Wars and 
the James Bond movies, some of 
the first movies to make a sub
stantial profit on their sequels, 
the movie industry has swamped 
us with sequels left and right.
However, 1990 has seemed to 
be kind to us so far. The only 
sequel to grace our screens this 
year was Ernest Goes to Jail, 
which died a prompt death at the 
box office. Could this year possi. bly be the beginning of the end of 
movie sequels? Dont hold your 
breath.
Within the next few years ex
pect an unbelievable forty-seven 
sequels to plague us. Heres a 
short list of some of the more 
interesting and soon to be released 
sequels.
Coming soon to a theatre 
near you
One of the first sequels to be or 
the lookout for is Back to tl 
Future Part III, which is due oit 
May 25. In this film, the Back/to 
the Future trilogy will finall} 
wrapped up with a trip to theOld 
West where Michael J. Fox and 
Christopher Lloyd meet up'with 
Biffs great-grandfatber. 7f you 
missed Part II, dont worry. You 
can catch it either in/QH2210 this 
Saturday, or at the video stores, 
where it will appear May 24, the 
day before the relpse of Part III.
Next to debut ai the big screen 
will be Die Hard II: Die Harder. 
This film takes^place exactly one 
year after the pginal Die Hard, 
where Bruce ^Villis must battle 
an elite military unit that seizes a 
major international airport. It was 
directed by IJenny Harlin (Night
mare on Eln\ Street 4: The Dream 
Master) and Willis was report
edly paid a whopping $7.5 million 
for this film,
Gremlins II is the next flick up 
to bat. Joe Dante directed the 
reported $49 millioii movie where 
total chaos results when a devel
oper levels the building that 
housed a purveyor of gremlins. 
Zach Galligan andPhoebe Cates 
return in the sequel.
Finally, schedule! for a June 22 
release is RoboCoph Peter Weller 
returns as the cop *f the future, 
struggling to regaii his human 
past while fighting i drug-crazed
gang. RoboCop II is sure to be 
packed with lots of guns, guts, 
and violence./
Other filmsto be on the lookout 
for this sumner are Delta Force
II, due out tttis June; Another 48 
Hours, in vnich Eddie Murphy 
and Nick Nflte return this July; 
Young Gunjll, with Emilio Este
vez, Kiefer Sutherland, and Lou 
Diamond Ehillips all returning; 
and Exorast III: 1990, where 
George C. Scott plays a Washing
ton, D. C. iolice lieutenant inves
tigating 3 series of ritual mur
ders.
jjater this year
Even plough Rocky TV was a 
disaster; that didnt stop Holly
wood fran making.Rocy V, which 
is currptly scheduled for a fall 
release After years of fighting in 
the rug, Rocky is stricken with 
damage and goes back to 
eager origins, only to beembroiled in a street fight 
his surrogate son. John 
A)ildsen directed the original 
\cky and returns to direct V. 
'opefully the film will live up to 
ie originals standards. 
Breaking out of the Lethal 
Weapon image will be Danny 
Glover, who will star in. Predator 
II:Body Count. PredatorII will be 
sans Arnold Schwarzenegger; 
however, Glover continues the 
hunt through the concrete can
yons of an urban jungle. Look for 
Predator II in the fall.
And just when you thought it 
was safe to go back to the theatre, 
Naked Gun II: The Smell of Fear 
will be appearing in late winter. 
This time terrorists try to destroy 
American solar-energy resources. 
Leslie Nielsen is slated to return.
Other sequel related films to be 
on the lookout for later this year 
are Bill & Teds Excellent Adven
ture II, with Keanu Reeves and 
Alex Winter returning; Childs 
Play II, in which Chuckie terror
izes Alex Vincent and Jenny 
Agutter; and Godfather III, which 
picks up in 1979 and follows 
Michael Corleones attempt to 
organize one final deal.
Youre kidding me
Some movies that you never 
thought in a million years would 
have a sequel are  believe it or 
not  having sequels made for 
them. One such film is Blue La
goon II: The Second Generation. 
Blue Lagoon II is currently in the 
preproduction stage, but is slated 
to follow the life of Brooke Shields 
and Christopher Atkins son. 
Honey, I Shrunk the Kids II
will be coming out with a sequel 
in the near future. Because of the 
amount of money which this film 
made last year, it was bound to 
happen. Currently three scripts 
are reportedly under considera
tion  Honey, I Sent the Kids to 
the Moon, Honey, I Made the Kids 
Invisible, and Honey, I Xeroxed 
the Kids. No word yet if Rick 
Moranis will be returning as the 
bumbling father.
Even though its been almost 
thirty years since the original, 
there are talks of a Mary Poppins
II. Shooting is expected to start 
next year and the script is report
edly being written by Brian Si
bley and Poppins author P. L. 
Travers.
Other sequels which are either 
currently being made, or will be 
made shortly, are Short Circuit
III, in which Number Five goes to 
college; The Neverending Story
II, now in postproduction in West 
Germany; Rambo IV, where 
Rambo battles for the ecology; 
Mannequin II, same story as the 
original, different people; and 
Psycho TV, with Anthony Perkins 
returning as the slashing psycho.
Worth the wait
Last, but not least, are some 
films which deserve sequels.
Following the Back to the Fu
ture trend of movie making (film
ing two films back to back) will be 
Aliens III and IV. Reportedly, 
Sigourney Weaver will only ap
pear briefly in III, but will star in 
TV. Walter Hill will be producing
III, while Kenny Harlin {.Die Hard 
IT) is set to direct. No word on who 
will direct or produce TV.
Scheduled to start filming this 
summer is Good Morning, Chi
cago (the sequel to Good Morn
ing, Vietnam). Robin Williams as 
Adrian Cronauer returns to Chi
cago after leaving Vietnam and 
picks up where his life last left off. 
Shooting is scheduled to start this 
summer.
Finally, the CMU classic High
lander is going to have a sequel. 
Shooting began in February in 
Buenos Aires, with Sean Connery 
and Christopher Lambert repris
ing their roles. No word as to 
what the storyline is as of yet, but 
one thing is known for certain: 
the movie will take place in the 
year 2020.
And the list goes on: Mystic 
Pizza II, Major League II, Dirty 
DancingII, Three Men and a Little 
Lady, Who Framed Roger Rabbit
II.... Will it ever stop? Dont count 
on it, for unless people stop seeing 
sequels, or movies become cheaper 
to make, sequels are here to stay.

LIO1The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  1 May 1990
Gordon 'Sting Sumners true colors are revealed
Voice from Control Booth'. Hold 
it, mate. Youre a bit flat here. 
Sting: Dont ever fucking tell 
me Im fucking flat.
Ah, yes. These must be lines 
from Stings latest acting venture; 
perhaps its a movie about a pre
tentious, elitist pop star who 
publicly degrades his family, 
regards his fans with snobbish 
contempt and handles criticism 
like a snivelling brat. Perhaps its 
not a movie.
Actually, the above exchange 
occurred during the recording of 
Stings first solo album, The 
Dream of the Blue Turtles. Sting 
doesnt like it when people tell 
him he did something poorly. 
Sting doesnt like a lot of things: 
the middle class (which comprises 
the majority of his fans), being 
famous, The Clash, etc. Sure, as 
the leader of The Police and as a 
solo artist, Gordon Sting 
Sumner has taken part in some 
very admirable activities (i.e. 
Amnesty International, efforts to 
save the Brazilian rain forests, et 
al), but thats all Sting: The Pub
lic Persona. Lets get to know the 
private Sting a little better, in a 
piece I like to call Sting: Actu
ally, I do have very few friends. 
Sting, as most of his fans know,
reading list for his
BLUES, ELVIS, AND 
SOMEBODY ELSE'S 
FAVORITE SONG

has an interesting past. Before 
joining The Police, he was em
ployed as a school teacher, and 
later on he performed with a jazz 
band. These are two things Sting 
wont let the rest of the world 
forget; constant discussion of his 
jazz roots in interviews and pe
dantic allusions to literature in 
his lyrics are testament to this. In 
a parody of Rolling Stone 
magazine, National Lampoon 
once jested that the next Sting al
bum was to be titled Please Take 
Notes. During a typically self-conscious interview in High Fidelity 
magazine, life imitated satire as 
Sting expressed the hope that ref
erences to Nabokovs Lolita and 
Homers Odyssey in his songs will
A
J provide a ________ ______
I well-meaning but ignorant fans.
* Onceapedagogue,alwaysapedagogue....
A part of Stings past that he 
doesnt like to talk about so much 
is his family. Well, not anymore, 
at least. Sting once told Rolling 
Stone I come from a family of 
losers ... and Ive rejected my 
family as something I dont want 
to be like. As unreservedly and 
intentionally vitriolic as these 
comments are, Sting  in an 
interview with the same Rolling 
Stone reporter several years later
 seems shocked that the quote 
hurt my family deeply. Hurt by 
the fact that you called them los
ers? Thats odd....
One of Stings favorite topicsof-artistic-lament is his success. 
Theres nothing worse than eve
rything going well, says poor, 
tormented-by-huge-popularity 
Sting. I tried screwing every 
woman who came into the room
 all that stuff  and none of it 
seemed to satisfy me. While Sting 
doesnt mention whether he sat
isfied his endless string of fuck 
dolls, its safe to assume they all 
walked away with a better under
standing of English literature. 
(Oh, Stingie  sing that song
where you . plagiarize Shake
speare!) A/nore credible quota
tion comes jom a 1979 interview 
with Rolliig Stone, in which a 
pre-popul/ir Sting asserts Suc
cess alwa/s necessitates a degree 
of ruthleiisness. Ill buy that.
Perhaps Stings most appropri
ate comment in regard to his popu
larity atid wealth is I sometimes 
wondei  if I wouldnt be more ma
ture had Inot had success. I won
dered, tooespecially after read
ing about the little tantrum over 
his flat vocals, not to mention 
other instances of brattiness. 
Sting has raging fits when visi
tors to his studio read the lyrics to 
his songs without knowing the 
melodies first. He also has a huge 
problem dealing with criticism of 
his music, causing one to ques
tion the validity of his the-pressare-a-bunch-of-worthless-morons 
attitude.
When the Village Voice gave 
Stings Nothing Like the Sun... a 
negative (okay, a scathing) re
view, the singer took it kind of 
hard (okay, real hard). In his 
response letter to the editor of the 
Voice, Sting proves himself an 
able Freudian by performing a 
thorough psychoanalysis of the 
nasty critic based solely on that
one record review. Sting arrives 
at the expert diagnosis that the 
Voice critic is a dipshit fascist 
simpleton who suffers from the 
hysteria and self-loathing of the 
child molester, the sickening rhe
torical violence of the neo-Nazi. 
While I find it hard to dispute Dr. 
Stings findings (after all, that 
dumb reviewer did pan Stings 
album  he must be a fascist), I 
could probably do my own bit of 
analysis based on the singers use 
of the terms hysteria and selfloathing....
I truly hope Sting has learned 
to accept failure more gracefully 
since then; if not, the reviews of 
his performance in the short-lived, 
universally-maligned production 
of The Three-Penny Opera must 
have given him an ulcer. Not only 
did Opera News magazine accuse 
Sting and company of reducing 
some of the best musical material 
in modem theatre to tattered 
remnants ofWeimar culture, (an 
impressive, if not quite praise
worthy accomplishment), but it 
singled Sting out as being with
out theatrical energy or command 
of the stage. Equally negative 
assessments of Stings acting in 
movies like The Bride might lead 
one to the conclusion that there is
something worse than everything 
going well.
When asked about his future, 
Sting is vague but <haracteristically pompous. He knows what he 
doesnt want. He doesnt want to 
be like Mick Jagger, he says, 
because Mick doesn't have any 
dignity. Dignity is Yery impor
tant to Sting, regardless of how 
his shameless self-promotion and 
public displays of hyper-narcis
sism suggest otherwise. (Sting, 
an advocate of privacy for celebri
ties, paradoxically shared the 
rather private occasion of his 
childs birth with the entire world 
in his movie Bring on the Night.), 
I dont want to be forty and

he tells New York Times reporter. 
John Pareles, adding which its 
true I dont exactly do now. Not 
exactly.

Im dying ... again. Yes, as I 
recall I think Ive died at least a 
dozen times, and subsequently 
been bom again a dozen times 
more. We have become blinded to 
the cyclic nature of life and death 
by the radiance of the illusion we 
have dubbedLife. Simply because 
we tend to share a common his
tory with our past lives, simply 
because we have looked into the 
mirror each day and seen the 
likeness of who we were the day 
before, we have been lulled into 
viewing our entire existence as 
one life.
The person I am now is not the 
same person I was five years ago, 
and I suspect the same is true of 
you. The people we were, for all 
practical purposes, are dead, and 
it is from the reservoir of all those 
dead peoples experiences that we 
draw the energy to fuel our cur
rent lives. One of these days, the 
experiences of your current life 
will simply be fertilizer for your 
next one.
Thats kind of the way comic 
books work too. One creative 
teams interpretation of a charac
ter is not the same as another's, 
yet the illusion of one continuous 
title, like one continuous life, 
remains. Some books are cur
rently dying, some are just get
ting used to their new lives, and
COMIC RELIEF
by Waseem Hussain
some are due to be born this 
summer. In no particular order, 
heres a list of about ten newborns 
that are bound to bring oodles of 
joy into the loving arms of comic 
book moms and dads everywhere.
It will be a summer filled with 
exciting new projects from some 
of the most talented people in the 
industry. Look for Dave Gibbons 
of Watchmen fame and Frank 
Millers prestige format project 
entitled Give Me Liberty. Another 
prestige format project due next 
month is Steve Rudes three part 
Worlds Finest, presenting Bat
man and Superman in an art style 
reminiscent of that from decades 
ago. Another big (and very expen
sive) project from the brilliant 
writer Alan Moore and his equally 
amazing artistic collaborator is 
the inebriating Big Numbers. If 
you have the money for these 
projects, it would be well spent for
books such as these.
Marvel Comics celebrates Cap
tain Americas fiftieth anniver
sary this summer with a prestige 
format series set during World 
War II. They have Justice League 
artist Kevin Maguire exhaus
tively researching the World War
II period to give this limited se
ries a masterfully-crafted feeling 
of authenticity. Regardless of the 
story, it should be worth the cash 
to see Kevin Maguires art in the 
prestige format.
Todd McFarlane pencils, inks, 
and writes a new Spiderman title 
patterned like the highly 
successful Legends of the Dark 
Knight. The storyline doesnt 
promise to be anything special 
(supposedly a revenge story 
loosely linked to the well-done 
Kraven Saga a few years ago), but 
with McFarlane doing all of the 
art it doesnt matter. This will 
definitely be a collectors item.
The Incredible Hulk, behind the 
strength of writer Peter David, 
should be on everyones must buy 
list. The plotline this summer 
reunites Bruce Banner with Rick 
Jones and his estranged wife, as 
Banners personality splits into 
three: Banner, a grey hulk, and 
the return of the green Hulk 
Smash!! Hulk. No matter how 
hard Marvel tries to make this
book commercialized, Peter David 
always finds a way to deliver a 
unique, quirky, high quality tale.
Miracleman begins an arc called 
Trouble in Paradise, brought to 
you by the best cover artist in the 
business, Dave McKean, and 
Sandman writer Neil Gaim an. 
Which brings us to the final three 
of the ten recommended books. 
Anybody reading comics in this 
day and age should have Sand
man, Doom Patrol, and Animal
Man in their ^collections. These 
three books form the Holy Trinity 
of comic booka, and are funda
mental to everj collection on the 
face of the earth.
There they are! Ten of the po
tentially best comics of the sum
mer! Of course there are a lot 
more out there, but hopefully 
youll have at least some money 
left over after all theannuals, the 
miniseries, and the legular titles 
you buy to give these jooks a shot.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  1 May 1990LllChanges await Forbes
By TERRI KASCH
| Tartan Asst. Diversions Editor
I think theres even a little bit 
| of fear about coming to the gal1 lery, says senior Holly Ludewig, 
assistant director of Forbes GalI lery.
Senior Debbi Gibbon, the 
gallerys director, agrees. She 
adds, Art can be a very intimi\ dating subject for a lot of people 
who were not exposed to it in 
childhood or had a bad experience 
with it  didnt enjoy how it was 
presented to them in school  
and tend to stereotype artists and 
i what they do.
Both women feel that Forbes 
Gallery has been misrepresented 
and misunderstood on this cam
pus for a long time, at least by 
those students who dont know 
^ much about it. So, they took some
time to set the record straight.
We are not part of the art 
department. It is an independ
ent, student-run organization, 
and anyone interested in exhib
iting or attending anything that 
happens at Forbes, they are more 
than welcome. Gibbon states. 
Its not a segregated, separatist, 
elitist organization.
Forbes Gallery offers weekly 
shows for student artists. Usu
ally juniors show their work with 
two other artists, while seniors 
display their work with only one 
other artist. Once a student signs 
up for a specific week, it is up to 
them to get their work in on time 
and hang it around the gallery in 
whatever fashion they envision.
Although the gallery puts an 
artists work in a professional en
vironment, the students are still 
given certain allowances that
may not be allowed them in other 
galleries. Gibbon explains, We 
try to give the students as much 
of a professional perspective of 
what a gallery experier ce would 
be like without being so ilgid and 
unforgiving. I think there are 
many instances that Forces will 
endure certain mistakes ,1 that a 
normal gallery would not. .10 its a 
good liaison between school and a 
real gallery experience. 1 
Both Gibbon and Ludew' | have 
had shows in the gallery. i\|bbon 
describes the experience oihav
ing her work shown. The work 
becomes something different 
when its presented in this way, 
in a gallery situation. You notice 
more of the flaws and the strong 
points of what you do because it 
allows you to get a perspective, 
both a physical perspective and... 
an emotional perspective.
The gallery allows artists con^ 
plete freedom with their work and 
method of expression. Artists can 
display any of their creations, even 
material thought to be obscene or 
controversial in some way. In fact, 
Gibbon welcomes controversy. In 
the following years I hope that it 
becomes more controversial. 
Thats almost what you need to 
draw attention to yourself, unfor
tunately, is something that does 
make the media. We never make 
the papers for a standard show.... 
Something that maybe would be 
a little controversial might actu
ally raise peoples awareness 
about the power of art.
The gallery has a bright future. 
They have considered plans to 
bring in musicians, chemists, 
computer programmers, and more 
architects. Ludewig also explains 
what is going on in the basement

of Forbes Gallery. In the past its 
just been a storage area... but this 
year weve changed it into some
thing called sub-art which is sort 
of an alternative space for instal
lation, monitors, video art, what
ever. There is even an art class 
that utilizes this space, although 
Gibbon says that she would like 
artists to adapt some of their work
for that space on their own also.
In a few weeks the gallery will 
shut down for the summer. Until 
that time there are two shows 
remaining. Next Friday two sculp
ture majors will show their work; 
the last show will have the work 
of two graduate students, from 
May 9 to May 20. All shows are 
open to the public.
Local bands to gear you up for finals
All right, last column.
The Laughing Hyenas are re' turning to Pittsburgh, finally, and 
its on this coming Sunday, so 
classes are over, finals havent 
started, and you dont have any 
excuse for not going to see them. 
The Hyenas are the most intense 
) band in existence, and if Boons 
Law holds (remember D. Boon, 
the late guitarist for the late Minutemen?), they wont be in exis
tence for too much longer. Which 
would be a bad thing. Especially 
\ if you havent seen them.
"Anyway, the Hyenas are play
ing with Sludgehammer, who are 
very good despite the fact that 
theyve ejected their old bass 
player, and also with Buffalo Tom, 
who are okay, even though theyve 
got a gawdawful song about a 
sunflower suit, whatever the fuck 
that is. The shows supposed to
MUSIC IN REVIEW
by Dan Bidwa
start around 8 pm, Stormfront 
time (thats 8:30 or 9 pm to you or 
me), and its all ages. You 
shouldnt miss this show. Trust 
me.
Lessee, what else.
Michelle Shocked will be in town 
next Wednesday (thats the ninth, 
chumps and chimps) at the Graf
fiti. Rumor has it that this might 
be her first tour with an actual 
band-type ensemble, which
doesnt sound too hot. (Yeah, I 
know  who ever heard of a BigTime Recording Artist perform
ing all alone? Silly me.) Simply 
stated, if shes all by her lone
some, it should be another stellar 
show. If shes traveling en masse, 
dont expect much. Unless, of 
course, you think that her albums 
of late are better than her live 
show (come on, shes been in town 
twice already so if you havent 
seen her yet, its your own damn 
fault) in which case youre already 
beyond help and should stop read
ing this right now, dammit.
For those of you still with it, the 
Didjits will insult everyone in 
town on the twelfth, with the help 
of those newly-named upstarts 
Salt Chunk Mary, at the Upstage. 
Theyll be playing their favorite 
songs off their new LP Hornet 
Pinata, and maybe some other
ones too. Its all ages, so whoop it 
up, kids.
The Lazy Cowgirls, the only 
punk rock band left in this sorry 
world, will be at the Upstage on 
the fifteenth, along with Babes In 
Toyland and Unsane. All things 
considered, everyone will be stu
pid and miss this show, thereby 
losing their one chance for peace 
and everlasting happiness. So 
what if youve never heard of any 
of these bands  dont compound 
your stupidity by missing this 
show. Its all ages too.
The Melvins are playing the 
Upstage on the twentieth, with 
Surgery. Im going to be a bit busy 
that day, but you should go.

AWhat is the significance of Brown vs. Board of Education of Topeka?

these separate observance days.

Brain Dead probes into inquiring minds
:. Ugly-on-a-Sticks mutant baby 
is due any day now. Weve al
ready been to the hospital three 
; times on dry runs, but it turned 
out the baby wasnt coming out, 
something else was about to ... I 
really dont wanna talk about that 
. part of it. But anyhow, the prob. lem with a person like Ugly, whos 
six-foot-nine and weighs 38 
; pounds, is that the baby, or what
ever it is inside there, has more 
strength than she does. The babys 
in there recording rap albums or 
something. Sometimes Ugly-ona-Stick just starts shaking, her 
whole body starts to vibrate, for 
no. reason. And when that hap
pens, Ive got to actually lift up 
. her T-shirt and look under there, 
and, well, there are some things 
tod disgusting to put in the news
paper.
See, I been going to Le Mans 
Babymaking Classes with Uglyon-a-Stick, learning how to press 
7. my thumbs up under her ribcage 
. and grunt so the little E.T.-head 
, space-alien baby will slide out of 
, there in less than 16 hours. Were 
,in a class with a bunch of guys 
. named Stefan and women named 
Heather, and we sit around on 
"blankets learning about what 
"smells to expect when the fetus 
' starts demanding his Supreme 
1 Court rights.
' But the problem with having 
Ugly-on-a-Stick as a Le Mans 
.. Babymaking Partner is that, first 
, of all, I am definitely not the little 
boogers daddy. We know its ei
ther Jimmy Bohannon or one of 
the Gonzalez brothers, but thats 
" as far as we can narrow it down. 
"The only way you could ever get 
 Jimmy Bohannon to look at a baby 
' is to glue a Budweiser label on the 
babys stomach. And the Gonzalez 
 brothers have a mariachi gig every 
pther Thursday at Juanitas 
Quark Chess Sets and Disco Pal/ ace in Matamoros. So theyre not 
. exactly what you would call your 
. nurturing types.
 And then the second thing thats 
wrong is that Ugly-on-a-Stick is
JOE BOB GOES TO THE 
DRIVE IN
by Joe Bob Briggs
so skinny that her stomach looks 
like an ice sculpture. I only have 
to look at her twice a week, but 
that thing is like looking at a 
relief map of Uganda thats been 
turned inside out with a Hoover 
vacuum cleaner. Shes got lumps 
on her that you could sell as sou
venir paperweights.
M0h, Joe Bob, thats just cel
lulite, she says to me.
Only if they started making 
cellulite in the shape of giant sea
horses.
And, frankly, Im ready for the 
little Loch Ness Fetus to go ahead 
and pop out of there before we 
have to perform Caucasian Sec
tion on Ugly-on-a-Stick. Cause 
shes been whining a lot about 
how shes not too fond of looking 
like a coat hanger after its been 
used to break into a Toyota. Ugly 
is hard enough to look at when 
shes just plain ugly. But if you 
can imagine a pipe cleaner with 
legs that has a cow intestine grow
ing out of the middle of it, then 
you get some idea of the sacrifice 
Im making.
Dr. Leo Fedora, whos gonna 
deliver the little mutant, is bring
ing in a podiatrist just to deal 
with Uglys splayed feet. Shes 
carrying around so much weight 
that she looks like a duck from 
the ankle down.
But the worst of it is when she 
wants to talk about it.
Joe Bob, shell say, you know 
how they say women get pretty 
when theyre pregnant?
Is that what they say?
Well, I know I look like a bur
rito pie thats been dumped on the 
linoleum....
Yes, you do.
... but in spite of all that, do you 
think that maybe I look just a 
little....
A little what?
I mean, since Im pregnant, do 
you think maybe you might say I 
was pretty?
No.
I didnt think so.
That wouldnt make sense, 
would it?
No, I guess not.
I wouldnt worry about it, 
Chloris. Think of it this way. 
Would you worry about putting a 
new layer of makeup on Tammy 
Faye Bakker?
No.
Same thing.
Wouldnt work, would it? 
Wouldnt work.
Oh, Joe Bob, you always know 
just what to say. I was starting to 
feel sorry for myself.
Please, God, make the baby 
come.
Speaking of people who should 
live in a jar, Brain Dead is this 
flick they made from an old Char
les Beaumont script (remember 
the guy who wrote all the Twi
light Zone episodes), and its the 
story of what would happen if a 
man decided to keep a whole lab 
full of pickled brains that used to 
belong to paranoid schizophren
ics, so he can figure out how to 
stick incredibly long needles into 
the brains and turn looney people 
into Wall Street bankers. Sorry, 
bad example. So he can turn 
looney people into perfectly re
spectable gameshow hosts.
Unfortunately,. Dr. Martin be
comes too attached to his brains. 
And so, when his old college chum 
asks him to go out to the insane 
asylum and run some tests on a 
real live paranoid schizophrenic 
named Halsey whos convinced 
hes being pursued by a guy named 
Conklin who owns Conklin Mat
tress Company and brutally
Inquiring minds, including George Kennedy, want to know just exactly whats in Bud Corts noggin In Brain 
Dead.
murdered Halseys wife and kids, 
only Conklin is now Halseys 
doctor in the hospital, then Dr. 
Martin rigs up this giant openbrain-surgery Erector set where 
he screws some scaffolding all up 
and down the side of Halseys 
head and starts  are you follow
ing this?  he starts slicing open 
Halseys head and poking into his 
memories so that all these corpo
rate weirdbeards can watch.
And then later, after they dont 
find diddly squat inside Halseys 
head; Dr. Martin is leaving the 
building carrying a brain under 
his arm, and a homeless street 
person sees him and starts 
screaming, Thats my brain! You 
stole my brain! and they get into 
a scuffle and the brain goes flying 
and splatters all over the pave
ment and Dr. Martin is trying to 
reach for it and he gets plastered 
by a car, and before you know it 
the doctor is in surgery and theyre 
opening up his brain and he thinks 
he is being pursued by Conklin, 
and sometimes he thinks hes 
Halsey, except for the times when 
Halsey is chasing him or he and 
Halsey are both being chased by 
Conklin, or else theyre swimming 
around in Halseys brain ... In 
other words, Twilight Zone kind 
of deal, to the point where you 
dont know whats going on.
Great movie, though.
One breast. Five dead bodies. 
Splattered brains. Disembodied 
face. Icepick stabbing. Brain 
swimming. Looney Fu. Electro
shock Fu. Lobotomy Fu. Drive-In 
Academy Award nominations for
Bud Cort, as Halsey, for saying 
We cant all do good, but at least 
do no harm; Bill Pullman, as the 
chief brain doctor, for saying My 
brains are individuals  theyre 
specialtheyre unique and for 
talking about the kinder, gentler 
lobotomy; Bill Paxton, as the 
marketing genius who comes up 
with the idea of plastic brain 
surgery: Tiad a bad childhood? 
We can fix it! ; George Kennedy, 
for making yet another drive-in 
movie where he has nothingto do; 
and Adam Simon, the director, 
for doing it the drive-in way in his

Home of the Brave
Anderson. Laurie. Performance. Art. Music. 
Dance. Film. Sperm.
Sperm?, I hear you cry. Yes, sperm. Hundreds of 
the little buggers, cartoonishly projected on a screen 
along with sketched sheep and technospeak man
tras, as Anderson and her band explore the shady 
ground between musical performance, spoken-word 
performance, dance, film, and sarcastic commen
tary on the nature of our cheaply manufactured 
media culture.
Home Of The Brave tries to document one of 
Andersons concertsa dubious aspiration at best 
 but the film succeeds in bringing to the screen 
some of the eerie, cynical spark of live Anderson, 
along with a hearty helping of not-so-straightforward weirdness and bizarre stuff. Fans familiar 
with Andersons albums shouldnt miss Home Of 
The Brave, and they should drag along a skeptical 
friend or two for a fresh look at one of alternative 
arts most respected talents.

Heavy Metal
Probably one of the oddest films to ever grace the 
silver screen, Heavy Metal is actually the work of 
many animated short stories all put into one film. 
The topics of each tale are wide and varied, but 
almost all center around science-fiction and are set 
to rock music. Some of the more notable features 
include: Harry Canyon, a New York City cabbie of 
the future who runs into girl who proves to be 
nothing but trouble, and Den, a boy whose macho 
fantasy turns into reality.
In addition to fabulous animation the film also 
includes the voices of John Candy, Joe Flaherty, 
Eugene Levy, and Harold Ramis, as well as some 
great music by Sammy Hagar, Blue Oyster Cult, 
Cheap Trick, and Stevie Nicks. Dont miss this film 
while you have the chance to see it, becuase its 
never on cable and you cant rent it in the video 
stores.

Back to the Future Part II
No, its not as good as the original. Still, the plot 
of Back to the Future Part II is clever and inspired. 
If you havent seen the original yet, youd better 
grab a copy from the video store before you attempt 
to see Part II or chances are youll be completely 
lost.
This installment in the Back to the Future trilogy 
has Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) travelling into 
the future with his wife-to-be Jennifer and his pal 
Dr. Brown (Christopher Lloyd) Their mission is to 
keep Martys son out of prison. They accomplish 
this swiftly enough, but unfortunately 85-year old 
bad guy Biff gets hold of a sports almanac and 
hitches a ride through time in Martys magic DeLorean. Biff makes it back to 1955 where he gives 
the sports almanac, with the lists of all the winning 
teams of the future, to his teenage self. Now, Marty 
and company have to find the moment in time 
where young Biff receives the book so they can take 
it away and save the present world from being run 
by the newly rich Biff. Confusing? Definitelybut 
its still a lot of fun.

The Fabulous Baker Boys
Young screenwriter Steve Kloves, whos respon
sible for Racing with the Moon, tries his hand at 
directing for this 1989 hit. Brothers Jeff and Beau 
Bridges portray brothers Frank and Jack Baker, a 
pair of musicians whove been playing the Seattle 
lounge scene for fifteen years. In order to spice up 
their tired act, they hire sexy singer Susie Diamond 
(Michelle Pfeiffer). She does put life back into their 
performances, but not without disrupting both of 
their lives. The Fabulous Baker Boys is a smart, 
elegant film  definitely worth a dollar and a few 
hours of your time.

THE BASICS
When the choice is to cook or to starve
So, you've decided to stay in Pittsburgh over the summer. 
Or maybe you'll be getting an apartment in a different city.
Whatever the case, you have your job, your apartment, and 
have registered for your summer classes. But now, how are you 
going to eat? You've depended on Dining Service for meals. 
Burger King and Wendy's won't seem very appetizing after a 
week. And spending all your earnings on eatfcSgfout isn't very 
realistic. The only alternative is to learn to cook.
Cookbooks can get confusing when they assume you know 
more than how to boil water. But don't despair. Below are a 
few hints and definitions to help you fend for yourself.
 First, you may want coffee or tea. You can get good deals 
by buying larger quantities, but beware, they loose their flavor 
quickly. So, keep your coffee and tea in the freezer or refrigera
tor to make them last longer.
 Fruit can spoil quickly as well. The best way to preserve 
cut fruit longer is to place it cut side down on a plate in the 
fridge. This is good for grapefruits, tomatoes, and oranges. If 
you buy fruit that is a little unripe, keep it at room temperature 
until it ripens.
 To keep the cut fruit and other foods in your refrigerator 
fresh, keep an open box of baking soda on a shelf. It'll also 
absorb odors. It works for the freezer too, and one box will last 
for three months.
Now, on to the real thing; a hot meal. Knowing some basic 
tips can make any recipes a lot easier to follow and prepare.
To start off, you don't want to break anything. Things may 
get slippery, so put bowls and plates on a folded wet towel. 
They won't fall that way.
When you first start a recipe, you'll need to get out the 
ingredients and prepare them. When measuring ingredients,
like sugar or flour, don't pack the ingredients down into the 
measuring cup or shake them to get more in. Once you fill the 
cup, take a straight edge (like the back of a knife) and pull it 
across the top of the cup, knocking off the excess. (One excep
tion is brown sugar. Pack in as much as possible, then level it 
off.)
It would be a good idea to use wax paper underneath your 
measuring cups, as well. That way, the extra amount that you 
spill off of the side will be able to be saved, instead of making a 
mess.
For flour, you usually need to sift it - that is, pass it through 
a sifter, also called a sieve. This helps put more air in it so that it 
mixes better.
Another task is separating eggs  the yolk (the yellow 
part) from the whites. To do this, break the egg over a glass, 
keeping the yolk in the egg shell. Then, pass the yolk back and 
forth between the two halves of the shell, letting the whites spill 
into the glass.
Some ingredients have to be cut up. You may have to peel 
them first, like potatoes or carrots. Cookbooks call this type of 
peeling "paring," as in "to pare a carrot." If you want to take 
the time, the outside of a carrot is the most nutritious. So 
instead of actually peeling it all off, take a small steel brush and 
scrape the carrot.
There are different degrees of slicing up food. "Dicing" is 
cutting food into very small cubes. Mincing is smaller than 
dicing. Grating or shredding is rubbing something up against a 
grater to reduce the food to small particles. If you lay a grater 
down over a bowl then you can just slide the food over it and it 
falls right in neatly. Julienne is cutting the food, usually meat, 
into thin strips. Finally, when you crush something in a food 
chopper, it's called grinding.
Just as there are many different forms of cutting, there are 
different types of cooking. You can baste, which is spooning 
liquid over food while it cooks. This prevents it from drying up. 
Another simple technique that will help in many a recipe is 
knowing how to bread meat. Dip the meat into flour first, then 
egg, and then bread crumbs. It should stay attached to the meat 
throughout cooking.
Then there is deep frying, frying, and sauteing, which use 
different amounts of fat. Deep frying requires a lot of fat; frying 
involves a medium amount of fat in a skillet; and sauteing uses 
a little fat on low heat. Fry small quantities at a time if you want 
faster results. Also, if you cover the pan or skillet with a colan
der it will prevent splattering, and still allow the food to brown.
Pan broiling is cooking meat on a hot dry surface. Usually 
you would use a broiling pan that has slots on the portion 
where the food goes so the grease falls away from the food.
Steaming is cooking food in steam. This is accomplished 
either by putting a very small amount of water in the bottom of 
a pan, putting the food in and covering or by putting the food 
on a surface above a pot of boiling water as the steam cooks it. 
You can buy an actual steamer or just improvise.
These basics should help you out with starting to cook.
And hopefully, you'll survive the summer. Who knows? You 
may even learn how to cook well, too!

MEAL ACCESSORIES
SAUCES
Eating the same foods over and over again can get 
really boring. Sometimes you're just not in the mood to cook 
a new complex recipe. There are some easy sauces that you 
can prepare and pour over chicken, pasta, meat, steamed 
vegetables and just about anything else you can think of.
Probably the easiest sauce you can make is a simple 
White Sauce. You need 1 teaspoon of salt, 1 /4 teaspoon of 
pepper, 2 cups of milk, butter and flour. For a thin sauce, 
use 2 tablespoons of butter and 2 of flour; for a medium 
sauce, use 4 tablespoons; and for a thick sauce, use 8 table
spoons.
First, melt the butter in a saucepan over low heat. Then 
stir in the flour, salt and pepper until it is well blended. 
Remove from the heat and add the milk in all at once. Stir 
the mixture until it is well blended again. Now cook the 
mixture over low heat, stirring constantly until it is smooth 
and thickened. This recipe makes about 2 cups of sauce, no 
matter which consistency you choose. You can adjust the in
gredients as you get used to making it.
A variation that is quite similar is a Parmesan Sauce. 
Add about half a cup of Parmesan cheese after the sauce is 
smooth but not thickened. Simply stir until the sauce is 
smooth again.
For something a little more suited to steaks or beef try 
this easy Bordelaise Sauce.
 4 tablespoons minced onion
 4 tablespoons butter
 2 bay leaves
 1 cup red Burgundy wine
 5 teaspoons cornstarch
11/2 cups canned beef broth or bouillon (This is just 
some type of instant soup mix  Lipton's will do.)
First, saute the onions in 2 tablespoons of butter until 
they look tender, but don't let them get browned. Add the 
bay leaves and wine and simmer over medium heat until 
about two thirds of the liquid evaporates. Combine the 
cornstarch and about 1/4 cup of the beef broth. The corn
starch will thicken up the broth so it becomes a smooth 
paste.
Now stir this mixture and the rest of the broth into the 
wine. Cook over low heat, stirring frequently, until the 
sauce thickens. Make sure you don't bring it to a boil. 
Remove the bay leaves. Just before you serve the sauce add 
the remaining two tablespoons of butter. This recipe makes 
about two cups of sauce.
Finally, a good way to perk up a salad that is suprisingly easy is by making Blue Cheese Salad Dressing.
Simply combine 1 cup mayonnaise, 1 cup sour cream, 1 
teaspoon of salt and peper, 1 or 2 teaspoons of chopped 
onion, 4 tablespoons of milk, and 1 cup of blue cheese 
crumbled. Let it sit for about 8 hours before serving and you 
have homemade salad dressing.
But no good dinner would be complete without the 
most important ingredient; guilt. Make sure anyone you 
feed feels properly subdued because they think you've 
slaved for hours in the kitchen.

SOUPS
"Soup is good food," according to a wellknown commercial. Especially when you're 
sick on a winter afternoon, with no more 
energy than that required to open a can and 
pour its contents into a saucepan.
Even if you have more motivation and 
want to cook from scratch, making soup is 
really not that difficult. Here's a simple recipe 
for French Onion Soup.
French Onion Soup
 4 lg. onions, thinly sliced
 dash pepper
 4 tablespoons margarine or butter
 6 slices 1/2" French bread, toasted
 4 10 1/2oz. cans condensed beef broth
1/2 cup dry sherry
 3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
 2 teaspoons Worchestershire sauce
 6 slices Swiss or Gruyere cheese
In a large saucepan, cook the onion in 
butter until tender (not brown), about 20 min
utes. Add the beef broth, sherry, Worchester
shire sauce and pepper and bring it toa boil. 
Pour into 6 small casseroles; float a slice of bread 
in each. Sprinkle generously with Parmesan 
cheese. Top each with slice of cheese.
Bake in a 375 degree oven for 15-20 minutes 
until bubbly.
While cooking soup, you can put a leaf of 
lettuce in the pot to absorb excess fat. If using 
soup stock, keep the heat low rather than 
boiling, to minimize the film that forms on the 
top. Long, slow cooking produces a better taste 
in any soup.
After finishing the soup, refrigerate or freeze 
it. If you refrigerate it, the fat will rise to the top 
for easy removal. If you freeze it, be sure to 
leave some space at the top of the container.
Cooking your own soup may be rather 
tedious, but it will be worth it when you're 
finished.

EGGS
"Americans alone eat about 270 eggs per person each year/' 
according to Julee Rosso and Sheila Lukins, authors of The New 
Basics Cookbook. Although eggs are preferred as breakfast food, 
they are commonly found in every meal of the day in such 
products as cakes, ice cream, souffles, sauces, stocks, and pas
tries. Only about 75 calories each, eggs were once considered 
"the perfect food" because they are low-calorie yet high sources 
of protein, vitamins and minerals.
An important fact to know about eggs is that they are best, 
of course, when they are fresh. Their age can be determined by 
following a simple test. Place the egg in a bowl of cold water. If 
the egg lays on its side on the bottom of the bowl, then it is 
definitely a fresh egg. If the egg stands slightly at an angle, then 
it is about three days old. Finally, if the egg stands straight up 
on end and floats, then it is at least ten days old.
For a more convenient test, simply check the sell-by date 
displayed at the end of an egg carton. This usually indicates a 
date that is three or four weeks after the grading; it is best to 
use the eggs before this date.
Remember those times when you wanted to boil an egg but 
found that you cracked the egg while trying to boil it or the egg 
was already cracked before you set it in the pot of hot water? 
Here are some helpful tips for you to salvage those cracked 
eggs as well as to prevent the cracks from occurring.
To prevent the egg from cracking while it boils, make sure 
that you wet the shell of the egg under cold water. Another 
method that may be more reliable is to add a big teaspoon of 
salt to the boiling water. If the egg cracks while it is boiling, add 
a slight touch of vinegar to the water to temporarily seal the
egg-If an egg is cracked and you can't really can't use it at the 
moment, preserve the yolk of the egg by placing it in a small 
bowl and add two tablespoons of salad oil or saturate the yolk 
in water and refrigerate. The yolk does not freeze well, but by 
refrigerating it, it will stay fresh and soft and can be used for 
many other purposes. The white, on the other hand, should be 
placed in the freezer rather than the refrigerator in order to 
preserve it for a longer time. A neat trick is putting the egg 
white in an ice cube tray and, after the white is frozen, popping 
it out of the tray and storing it in a freezer bag.
As for cooking eggs, you can give them a lift by adding the 
right ingredients. Instead of just scrambling them plain, try 
experimenting with some combination of dashes of Oregano, 
soy sauce, milk, cooked and crumbled bacon, grated cheese, 
diced ham, chopped tomato, green peppers, cubed cream 
cheese, sliced mushrooms and green onions. Similar things can 
be thrown into an omlette. The ingredients for the middle of an 
omlette should be added just before the eggs start to set. To 
make an omlette, put in the desired ingredients and lift up the 
edges slightly and towards the center, letting the uncooked egg 
flow onto the bottom. When the eggs are lightly set, fold in half 
and serve. Three eggs make a nice sized omlette.
To conclude this tidbit on eggs, here's a slightly more 
challenging recipe. This crustless quiche makes a perfect lunch 
entree.
Springtime Quiche
 12 cups trimmed fresh spinach leaves
 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
 3/4 cup chopped peeled shallots
 3 plum tomatoes
 1 cup of milk
 2 eggs
 3/4 cup Monterey Jack cheese
 1 /4 cup chopped fresh dill
 2 teaspoons grated lemon zest
 1/2 teaspoon salt
 Freshly ground pepper, to taste
9 1 tablespoon dried bread crumbs
 1 tablespoon freshly grated Parmesan cheese
Rinse the spinach well and place it in a large saucepan with 
just the water that clings to the leaves. Place the saucepan over 
low heat, and stir to wilt the spinach, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain well, 
squeezing out excess moisture. Chop coarsely, and set aside. 
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
Melt the butter in a small skillet, and saute the shallots over 
medium-low heat until translucent, 5 minutes. Set aside. Now, 
halve the tomatoes and squeeze them, releasing and discarding 
the seeds and juice. Coarsely chop and set aside.
In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the milk, eggs, 
Monterey Jack cheese, dill, lemon zest, salt, and pepper. Stir in 
the reserved spinach, tomatoes, and shallots.
Thoroughly butter an 8-inch square baking pan. Add the 
filling, and sprinkle with the bread crumbs and Parmesan. 
Finally, bake until golden, 25 minutes. Let the quiche stand for
10 minutes before serving. This recipe makes 6 to 8 portions.

MEAT AND POULTRY
move freely when jiggled, then the bird is done. A simple dish 
to prepare is to marinade a boneless chicken breast in soy sauce 
overnight, and then pan fry it in butter until it is done.
These two recipes are simple and relatively inexpensive.
Veal Piccata
3/4 pound boneless veal cutlets, cut 1/3 inch thick and 
pounded 1/4 inch thick
 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
 1/2 tablespoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper
 3 tablespoons butter or margarine
1/3 cup white wine
 1 teaspoon grated lemon peel
 Lemon slices
Pound cutlets by placing between sheets of wax paper or 
plastic wrap. Pound to desired thickness with the flat side of a 
meat tenderizing mallet (a rolling pin or other blunt object will 
do). Be careful not to pound through the meat. Cut meat into 
strips about 11/2 inches wide and 3 inches long. In a pie pan, 
mix flour, salt, and pepper. Lightly dust meat with flour 
mixture. Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a wide frying pan 
over medium high heat. When butter sizzles, add veal, without 
crowding, and cook until browned on both sides (about 2 
minutes each side). Remove veal; arrange on a platter and keep 
warm until all are cooked. Add wine to pan; bring to a boil, 
scraping browned particles free from pan. Stir in lemon peel 
and the remaining 1 tablespoon butter; heat until melted. Spoon 
sauce over veal and garnish with lemon slices. Makes 2 or 3 
servings.
Sweet and Sour Chicken
11/2 pounds boneless 
chicken breasts
 2 tablespoons butter
 2 cups water 
1/2 cup salad vinegar 
1/3 cup honey 
1/4 cup coarsely chopped 
green pepper
 2 tablespoons chopped 
pimento
 1 teaspoon paprika
 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger 
 1 tablespoon cornstarch
Cut chicken into thin strips and 
brown in skillet with butter. Add 1 
cup water, vinegar, honey, green 
pepper, pimento, paprika, and 
ginger. Cover and simmer for 10 
minutes. Thicken sauce by adding 
one cup of water with the corn
starch to it. Serve over rice. Makes 4 
servings.

It is possible to achieve a wide variety of tastes using meat 
and poultry with minimal preparation. The recipes given below 
are examples of dishes that are simple yet have a distinctive 
taste.
Although the time that different meats can be refrigerated 
varies, generally it is not advisable to refrigerate any meat for 
more than three days. Meats such as liver should be used 
within a day of purchase. If it is necessary to keep meat for 
more than three days, it is possible to freeze it in plastic wrap. 
Meat stored in this manner will keep for several weeks. Be sure 
to thaw meat in a refrigerator and not at room temperature.
The methods of cooking meat that you can choose from 
depend upon the cut that is being used. Tender cuts (from the 
rib or loin) can be roasted, broiled, grilled, pan-broiled, or fried. 
Cuts from the shoulder or shank require moist heat, which 
means stewing or braising. Both of these cooking methods 
involve cooking the meat in a small amount of liquid, covered, 
for an extended period.
An alternative that can be used with tougher cuts is to ten
derize the meat. This will allow it to be cooked as if it were a 
tender cut. This can be accomplished in a variety of ways. One 
method is to marinade the meat by placing it in a plastic bag, 
and then adding a cup of wine, vinegar, or citrus juice. Another 
method employs chemical tenderizing powders, which may be 
purchased in a grocery store, and the final method involves 
pounding the meat with a cleated mallet. In any event, cook the 
meat until it is no longer pink.
When cooking poultry, there are a variety of ways to check 
if it is done. When sauteing, frying, baking, or braising, cut a 
small gash to the center of the meat. It should not be pink and 
the juices should run clear yellow. With a whole bird, if the legs

---------------------------------------------------

The notion of cooking fish can be a little intimidating for 
the novice chef. Even students who Eire fairly accomplished 
cooks and love fish won't make it often. The reason probably 
has less to do with having a hard time cooking it, and more to 
do with having to handle it raw. There are ways of getting 
around the particularly odious aspects of cooking fish  the 
way it smells before it's cooked and how to tell when it's done
 and it's very easy to make.
 Fresh fish need not be frightening.
You look at the fish, it looks at you. At first, it may not 
seem worth it, but fresh fish really does taste better, and you'll 
notice the difference when you taste it. Choosing a good fish is 
a lot like choosing a good piece of fruit. First and foremost, it 
should look fresh; it shouldn't smell or look like it's been sitting 
around for days on end. Its flesh should be moist, firm, and 
elastic. Its eyes should be full, not sunken. Usually the gills will 
have been removed, and you should remove them later if it 
hasn't been done for you; if they're there, they should be 
reddish pink.
To prepare the fish for cooking, soak the fish in water for a 
couple of minutes before you start working on it. Wear plastic 
gloves or rub lots of salt on your hands, so the fish won't slip. 
Hold the fish near its tail on a cutting board and scrape off the 
scales with a serrated knife, going from the tail to the head. 
Make cuts on both sides of the fins so that they'll be easy to 
remove before or after the fish is cooked. Cut the fish on the 
bottom (at the belly) from head to tail, and remove the entrails. 
Be sure to remove the large vein along the backbone. Then rinse 
the fish in cold, lightly salted water, and drain it. If you want to
 and most people do, although it's optional  cut off the 
head and tail. To remove the bones, make another cut parallel 
to the first, and pry each side away from the bones using the 
knife.
Of course, you can usually find fresh fish fillets in a good 
grocery store. The convenience of buying them may be worth 
their added expense.
 It doesn't have to smell.
Frozen fish is always an alternative, and you don't have to 
be limited to fish sticks. Fresh fish that you've frozen yourself 
should be thawed in a refrigerator. Frozen filleted 
(preprepared) fish doesn't have to be thawed before you cook 
it. If you get fresh fish, then you definitely don't want it hang
ing around in your refrigerator. Plan on cooking it the same 
day or the day after you buy it.
Keeping the fishy smell off of your hands while you cook is 
easy; before you cook it, put the fish in a container of cold 
water, put the container in the refrigerator, and let it get cold 
before you handle it. Lemon juice or butter will take care of any 
odors you might encounter while cooking the fish.
 It's easy to tell when it's done.
You can estimate how long it will take to cook a fish by 
measuring it at its thickest area. Then cook the fish ten minutes 
for every inch you measured. It doesn't matter whether you 
bake, fry or broil it; the time stays the same. If you're baking the 
fish, the oven should be at a temperature of about 450 degrees.
These times are just estimations; you'll want to check the 
fish to make sure it's done. If you stick a wooden toothpick in it 
and the toothpick comes out dry and clean, then the fish is 
done.
 It's easy to make.
Preparing fish doesn't have to involve a lot of seasonings or 
odd ingredients you'll never use again; there are lots of seafood 
seasonings available in any supermarket that make cooking fish 
quick and easy without having to condemn yourself to a bland
meal. Seal the fish, along with some butter and seafood season
ing, in a piece of foil. Bake it until the fish is tender and easy to 
separate. You can also roll the fish in flour and fry it until it's 
golden brown. Here are a couple of recipies that are a little 
more interesting, but still easy to make:
Baked Salmon Steaks
 4 salmon steaks, 1 inch thick (about 2 lbs.)
 2 tablespoons lemon juice
 4 thin lemon slices
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
 8 teaspoons brown sugar
 1 tablespoon margarine or butter, melted
Heat oven to 375. Pour lemon juice into ungreased rectan
gular baking dish, 11 x 71/2 x 2 inches; sprinkle with 1/4 cup 
brown sugar. Arrange salmon steaks in dish; drizzle with 
margarine. Bake uncovered 15 minutes; turn. Place 1 slice 
lemon on each salmon steak; sprinkle each steak with 2 tea
spoons brown sugar. Bake until fish flakes easily with fork, 15 
to 20 minutes longer. Serve with juices from dish. This makes 4 
servings.
Golden Fish Fry Almondine
 2 16-ounce packages of frozen fillets
11/2 cups cracker crumbs (i.e. Saltines)
 1/4 lb. butter or maragrine
 3/4 cup sliced, blanched almonds
Let the frozen fish thaw. Pat dry. Separate fillets. Shake the 
fillets in a bag with the cracker crumbs, along with some salt 
and pepper if you like. Fry fillets gently in half of the butter, 
about 3 minutes on each side, until the fillets are light gold in 
color. Move the fillets to a baking dish, and keep them in the 
oven on a heat setting low enough to keep them warm without 
cooking them. Melt the rest of the butter in a pan, and stir in the 
almonds. Cook the almonds until they are slightly brown, and 
pour the mixture over the fish. Cook the combination in the 
broiler for a minute or two before serving; let it get boiling hot. 
Then serve. This makes 4 servings.

LOCAL FOOD SHOPPING
Grocery shopping is a pleasure for some and a 
pain for others. Wandering the aisles of a local 
supermarket can be relaxing if one is only looking 
for something new for dinner after dining at Kilte 
for two weeks. But for those who don't have meal 
plans and are dependant either upon their own 
culinary skills or their microwave, shopping is a 
common chore. Here are some places anyone can go 
and visit in order to gather necessary goodies.
If you have the money and are in the mood for 
fresh vegetables, try the gourmet store on Walnut 
Street in Shadyside. This place is a yuppie dream 
come true. It's carpeted, quaint, and quite cute.
There is a huge selection of exotic spaghetti sauces 
(excuse me, pasta sauces) and salad dressings. The 
fruits and vegetables could only be described as 
beautiful. A fun tiling to do is drop into the store on 
the weekends after dinner to meet people and to see 
what the "chic" shoppers are wearing this season.
A somewhat larger version of this store is the 
Food Gallery in East Liberty. It's kind of like a Giant 
Eagle on a bigger budget. The selection here is 
naturally more extensive because of its size, but 
expect to pay for the cleanliness of the store and 
quality of the food.
The Green Grocer in Squirrel Hill specializes in 
high quality fruits and vegetables and has a marvel
ous selection. Here you can get the basics for a tre
mendous dinner salad or side dish. Even if you're 
just looking for some veggies to munch on while 
you diet, this place can help you out in style.
If you're in the mood for a quick box of Twinkies after Entropy closes or can't afford the prices in 
the Co-op, there is always your friendly neighbor
hood Giant Eagle. The one in Squirrel Hill on 
Murray Avenue is the most accessible to those living 
on campus. It has a great variety of foods and the 
price is almost always right. It's also conveniently 
open 24 hours. But, as anyone who has been there 
knows, after 6 pm during the week, the place is a 
madhouse. It is so cramped that unless you are 
either very patient or very desperate, you might be 
better off going elsewhere.
Another option for the more adventurous are 
ethnic grocery stores. There are a couple of oriental 
stores in Squirrel Hill which carry familiar and 
bizarre foods as well as various cooking instruments 
and utensils. There are also stores which cater to 
Italian and Greek tastes in East Liberty and Bloom
field. Shopping in these stores can be a lot of fun for 
those who enjoy experimenting in the kitchen and 
are always looking for something new.
Even if you're not Jewish, check out the kosher 
food stores also found on Murray Avenue in Squir
rel Hill. Like the gourmet stores, the items in the 
kosher delis and grocery stores are not always 
inexpensive. But, because of the regulations placed 
on the foods and rigid inspection practices, you are 
almost always guaranteed pure, healthy food.
The old fashioned neighborhood bakery may be 
vanishing from the American landscape, so take 
advantage of either Waldorf's or Rosenbloom's in
Squirrel Hill. These are excellent suppliers of freshly 
made breads. Rosenbloom's is especially known for 
bagels. While both are also great places to get 
cookies and pastries for snacking, Waldorf's makes 
especially good cakes for parties or desserts.
There are many other grocery and specialty 
stores around the area in easy access to CMU 
students. Don't let yourself fall into a rut; as you 
experiment in the kitchen, experiment with stores.

AROUND THE COUNTRY IN 40 FOODS
It is highly likely that those of you graduating 
this May will be seeking jobs in a city other than 
Pittsburgh or your home residence. It is also very 
possible that many of you not graduating are 
planning to spend the summer in a city unfamiliar to 
you. Knowing what food a city is known for, where 
to buy it, and which restaurants prepare it best and 
at a reasonable cost is a good way to keep your cost 
of living down while eating excellent food at the 
same time.
Philadelphia
Philadelphia wouldn't be the same without its 
famous hoagies and cheese steak sandwiches. The 
name "hoagie" comes from Hog Island, an island 
near the city where the sandwiches orginated. 
Hoagies are very popular in Philadelphia and 
there's a hoagie shop every block on South Street. 
Jim's is the place to experience the best cheese 
steaks. Also located on South Street, Jim's stays open 
until 4 am.
Boston
Living in Boston, you'll soon discover the 
excellent seafood shipped in right from Cape Cod. 
Scallops, flounder, and haddock are the favorites 
and each can be bought inexpensively in fish 
markets or grocery stores. Of course, we can't leave 
out delicious New England clam chowder, which 
can be found in just about every restaurant in 
Boston.
New York City
New York City offers a wide variety of excellent 
food from Chinese to Mexican to Italian to Ameri
can. Of course, most of these foods are only avail
able in restaurants and they're also very expensive. 
However, walking through Little Italy, Chinatown, 
Greenwich Village or SoHo you can find fresh food 
markets with homemade selections. These small 
markets are inexpensive, and you can bring fresh 
ethnic food home and cook up a meal yourself.
San Francisco
The city by the bay is a lot like New York in that 
you can find a wide variety of foods. San Francisco's 
Chinatown has lots of small shops where you can 
find everything you'll ever need for a Chinese meal. 
And in the Italian section, you'll find your favorite 
Italianpastas, cheeses and sauces  much more than 
just Rice-A-Roni.
Baltimore
When asked what delicious type of food is 
available in Baltimore, my native Maryland friend 
replied, "Steamed blue crabs, of course!" At 
O'Bricky's restaurant, you can bring your own blue 
crabs from the fisherman, or the market or 
O'Bricky's will serve you their own. Steamed and 
seasoned with "Old Bay Seasoning," black pepper, 
or beer, these Baltimore blue crabs are delicious!
Portland, Maine
Everyone knows that Maine has great lobster 
whether or not they've tried it. Well, it's true, Maine 
does have delicious lobster. Most restaurants pre
pare their own wonderful lobster dishes, but the tra
ditional way to eat lobster is at a clam bake. Partici
pating in a clam bake is a great way to spend a 
summer afternoon with friends in Maine. The
lobster is brought in and cooked on the premises 
and you choose the one you want to eat. Next comes 
com on the cob, baked potatoes, a bag of steamed 
mussels or clams, and of course a cup of hot butter 
for dipping. Fresh lobster can be purchased from 
fishermen on the coast or in markets.
Chicago
Chicago is known for it's deep dish pizza - it's 
where Pizzeria Uno's orginated. Like New York 
City, Chicago has a wide range of foods to choose 
from besides the pizza. Chicago is big on tapas bars 
or "little bites" of bar food which originated in the 
nineteenth century and developed as a Spanish 
custom. A few recommended moderately priced 
tapas bars with delicious meals are Cafe Ba-Ba 
Reeba!, Cafe Spiaggia, Monique's Cafe, and Star Top 
Cafe. All are great for lunch or dinner.
New Orleans
The sin city is no less sinful when it comes to 
food. In just about every restaurant you'll have a 
choice between Cajun and Creole. Cajun is hot and 
spicy food like blackened seafood, and creole is 
french cuisine. All the seafood is excellent and really 
cheap, but New Orleans is especially known for 
crayfish, or crawfish as it's called by natives. An
other New Orleans delicacy is Po Boys, which are
french. For dessert you'll probably want to snack on 
some pralines, a sickeningly sweet candy made with 
pecans and a lot of sugar.
Seattle
Seafood puts Seattle on the map as one of the 
places you definitely have to visit for fresh seafood, 
especially salmon and lox. It's all straight from the 
surrounding waters, so you can expect the seafood 
to be nice and fresh, whether you're preparing it or 
it's being served to you. What you wouldn't expect 
from this city is the Oriental restaurants that are on 
just about every block. Also, another big treat is 
cappuchina and espresso. It's so popular that even 
gas stations serve it.
Texas
Everything's bigger in Texas, and this includes 
the ten gallon steaks you'll find. Barbequed steaks 
and ribs are as popular as they are large here, and 
you won't have to roam far to find chili and tex-mex 
food. Tex-mex is an Americanized version of Mexi
can food with an American affinity for meat and 
vegetables (in Texan proportions) and a taste with a 
Mexican kick.

VEGETABLES
It's hard for a vegetarian to get by at CMU. Dining Service 
does try by offering a non-meat dish as a main entree at Morewood Gardens and Kiltie, but truthfully they aren't all that 
tasty or particularly nutritious. Students who move into 
housing with cooking facilities for the summer are fortunate, 
however. They have the means  and in some cases, more time
 to experiment with food. This is a guide to help select and 
prepare different vegetables as well as two great recipes.
 Guide to selecting vegetables
Broccoli and Cauliflower: The flower clusters should be 
tight and close together. Beware of smudgy, dirty spots  they 
may mean that there are insects.
Head Lettuce and Cabbage: Choose heads that are heavy for 
their size. Avoid heads with discoloration or rot.
Cucumbers: Long, slender cucumbers are the best quality. 
They should be a medium to dark green; cucumbers with any 
yellow should be avoided.
Melons: Cantaloupes are best if the space between the 
netting is yellow or yellow-green. They are best to eat when 
they have a ripe fruity odor. Honeydews are ripe when the rind 
is a pale yellow. Honeydews that are not ripe have a whitishgreen cast to them. Watermelons, if ripe, have some yellow 
color on one side. If they have a white or pale green color, they 
are not ripe.
Peas and Lima Beans: Select pods that are full but not bulg
ing. Avoid dried, spotted, yellowed, or flabby pods.
Carrots: Should be smooth and firm. Fresh carrot tops 
usually mean fresh carrots, but condition of the leaves does not 
indicate freshness.
 How to prepare vegetables
nsfoofrth boil in salted water 1" deep, ends down and 
heads out of water, for 10-15 minutes.
Carrots: boil in salted water 1" deep, with the lid on the 
pot, for 20-30 minutes.
Cauliflower: boil in unsalted water 1" deep, with the lid on, 
for 20-30 minutes.
efswh boil in enough unsalted water (plus 1 tsp. sugar) to 
cover, for 8-10 minutes
Uiirvwyh bake at 350 degrees, uncovered, until tender 
(about 45 - 60 minutes).
Cdpgsff.ph saut in butter or margarine for 8-10 minutes
Tcvph boil in salted water 1" deep, with the lid on, for 10-12 
minutes.
These two recipes both involve squash. Both of are very 
good. I've had them many times and, as my mom says, "they 
are good for you."
Zucchini and Cheese Casserole
 3 lbs. Zucchini, unpeeled and cut into 1" chunks (Discard 
seedy core, if using large zucchinis.)
 1 cup lowfat cottage cheese
 1 to 1 1/3 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese
 Two eggs or two egg whites and one egg, beaten with a
fork
 1 teaspoon dill seeds
 1 1/4 teaspoon salt, if desired, or to taste
 1 /2 cup dried bread crumbs or herbed stuffing mix
 1 tablespoon butter or margarine, cut up
Simmer zucchini chunks in just enough salted water to 
cover them for five minutes. Drain well.
In a large casserole dish, combine the zucchini with cottage 
cheese, Monterey Jack cheese, eggs, dill seed, and salt. Bake the 
mixture in a preheated oven at 350 degrees for fifteen minutes.
Sprinkle the top of the zucchini mixture with bread crumbs 
and dot with the butter or margarine. Bake the casserole for 
another fifteen minutes.
This recipe can be served as either a main dish or a side 
dish. It makes six side dish servings.
Spaghetti Squash
 Squash
 Spaghetti sauce
 Parmesan cheese
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Cut the squash in half and 
scoop out the seeds. Place the cut side down on a large flat pan 
1 /4" water. Bake for approximately one hour.
Remove from oven. Turn over each half. Let cool for ten to 
fifteen minutes. Pull fork across cut side; squash should sepa
rate into spaghetti like strands.
Now top it off with your favorite spaghetti sauce. Add parmasean cheese to taste. Serve with garlic bread and a green 
salad.

MICROWAVE COOKING
A strange phenomenon has been sweeping through dorms 
where no cooking is allowed. Students have these funny 
looking TV sets that only tune into TV channels that show food 
cooking. It's quite remarkable. So what do you do for real food 
when you don't have an oven or range top, and all you have 
are these strange little TV sets?
When most college students think of microwave cooking, 
they think of making instant foods or reheating leftovers such 
as pizza. But a microwave can be used for heathy, flavorful 
eating, and not just Chef Boyardee meals.
You can use a microwave to prepare instant oatmeal, warm 
coffee, make hot chocolate or tea, heat hot dogs or bake a 
potato. Microwaves can prepare a normal full course meal. The 
problem is finding recipes designed for microwaves instead of 
conventional ovens. The best source for this is the cookbook 
that usually comes with the purchase of a microwave.
But before you start cooking with a microwave, you should 
remember a few simple facts.
First of all, contrary to popular belief, microwaves do not 
cook from the inside out. They cook the same way that conven
tional ovens do. Also, it is sometimes possible to use metal in 
more recent models of microwaves, although dishes with me
tallic tin should not be used. Metal reflects heat and will slow 
cooking down, but it will not necessarily damage the micro
wave. (You should check the instruction manual for the specif
ics on your particular oven.) Lastly, dishes do get hot, even 
microwave safe dishes.
Microwave cooking techniques are quite different from 
conventional cooking techniques. Food should be arranged so 
that thicker, larger sections are closer to the walls of the micro
wave. This will ensure even cooking. Foods in shallow dishes 
cook more quickly than foods in deep ones. Also, round shapes 
cook more evenly than those with corners. When cooking many 
separate items at once, arrange them in a large circle with space 
between each item so the food will cook more evenly. Finally, 
covering dishes with plastic wrap or lids holds in steam for 
faster cooking; even if you don't want the food to cook taster, 
cover it with a paper towel to prevent splattering.
it is also important to remember that standing time is 
necessary for many recipes. If a recipe calls for standing time 
after cooking, it is to let the inside of the food cook without 
excessive drying. So don't simply ignore standing time, because 
it is actually cooking time outside the microwave.
One healthy use for a microwave is steaming vegetables. 
Just put a small amount of water in the bottom of a dish with 
the vegetables. Cover with saran wrap or a lid and cook for 
about 30 seconds (the time will vary depending on the micro
wave). You'll have vegetables that are crisp and steamed.
Below are two recipes that might not normally be made in a 
microwave.
Scrambled Eggs
 1 tablespoon butter
 2 eggs
 2 tablespoon milk
Melt butter in serving dish on High power for 30 seconds. 
Add in eggs and milk, and scramble with a fork. Microwave for 
about 3/4 minute; eggs will start to set.
Break up cooked portions and stir to center of dish. Micro
wave for about 3/4 more minutes, stopping at various intervals 
to stir the eggs toward the center.
Eggs will look moist and underdone. Let them stand for up
to 4 minutes, and stir.
Bacon Garlic Chicken Breasts
*1/4 cup butter or margerine
 1 clove garlic, finely chopped
 2 teaspoons dried parsely flakes
 1 teaspoon grated lemon rind
 1/4 teaspoon salt
9 1/8 teaspoon hot pepper sauce
 2 whole chicken breasts (about 1 lb each), halved
 4 bacon slices, cut in half
First place the butter and garlic in a glass baking dish and 
microwave on High for about 1 minute, or until garlic is partly 
cooked. Mix in the remaining ingredients, except for the 
chicken and bacon. Now roll the chicken in the butter mix and 
arrange, skin side up, in the baking dish. Finally, lay 2 half 
slices of bacon on each breast.
Microwave for 14 to 18 minutes on High, or until the meat 
near the bone is no longer pink. Let stand for 5 minutes before 
serving. This recipe makes 4 servings.

AND FOR DESSERT
Baking is one of the most easy and fun aspects of cooking.
If you've never baked before, then there are a few main items 
you may want to get to start off. This article is addressed more 
towards the beginning baker who wants to know how to be 
successful without spending a lot of money.
Once you practice baking a bit, you can innovate with 
recipes. Fruit in plain muffins, instant coffee grounds in a 
chocolate batter, etc... Plain boxed cake, cookie, and bread 
batters make an inexpensive and quick starting place for 
creations of your own.
For starters, you will need bakeware and ingredients. As 
far as bakeware goes, there are many pans and trays which can 
be used. If you actually buy good pans, then it can get pretty 
expensive, so here are suggestions for multi-purpose items.
You may want a cooking sheet or two, used for most kinds 
of cookies. The sheets can also be used for other cooking, but if 
you're not a big fan of sweets, you probably won't want them. 
There are many types you can buy. The cheapest are the 
throwaway aluminum foil variety found in the grocery store. If 
you are planning to bake fairly often, then this can get rather 
expensive.
The absolute best you can buy are the new "insulated" 
sheets which can be found at most cooking or hardware stores. 
These will last a lifetime and your cookies will never burn, but 
they can cost in the teens, so if you're a casual baker, this 
wouldn't be the best choice. The preferred option is a treated 
surface which prevents sticking and keeps you from the messy, 
caloric, and fat filled step of greasing the pan. My suggestion 
would be Baker's Secret brand pans which cost a couple of 
dollars in the grocery store (even cheaper at a K-Mart-type 
store) and worth the investment, because they, too, will last if 
cared for.
The second type of bakeware you may want to start your 
collection with is either muffin tins or a bread loaf pan. With 
either of these, you can make sweet baked goods such as quick 
breads or muffins or non-sweet breads or rolls. Muffin and 
bread recipes can ordinarily be interchanged, so if you don't 
want to buy both, you have options. Baker's Secret makes both 
items.
As far as care goes, don't put coated pans in the dish
washer, and don't scrub them with abrasive cleaners like steel 
wool or SOS pads. If anything really sticks, soak with detergent 
in hot water for a couple of hours. The best thing is to rinse the 
pan as soon as it cools to lengthen the life of the surface.
You will also need some other items for preparation. A set 
of mixing bowls is pretty necessary since most regular bowls 
aren't big enough to accomodate an entire recipe, especially
when you have to mix a liquid batter. Wooden spoons can be 
used for mixing and are good for other cooking as well. A 
rubber spatula is also really convenient. It isn't absolutely 
necessary, but it makes pouring a batter into a pan much easier, 
prevents waste, and makes clean-up easier. Finally, you will 
need a set of measuring cups and measuring spoons. All these 
items come in expensive varieties, but can also be bought 
cheaply in grocery stores, variety stores, and at garage sales.
The next thing you will want is ingredients. Obviously, 
there will be special ingredients in most recipes that you are 
unlikely to have on hand. (Baking from scratch always pro
duces the best results, and if you're health conscious, you can 
control what goes into it.) You will almost always need flour, 
sugar, eggs, milk, butter, either baking powder or soda, and 
often vanilla extract and a variety of spices.
Any all-purpose white flour will do, and it is inexpensive. 
One thing to keep in mind, particularly during the summer, is 
that flour can become mealy  little white worms breed in the 
flour. To prevent this, keep flour sealed in a jar or the opened 
bag covered with a plastic bag which can be closed.
Granulated sugar should be kept sealed in the summer as 
well, since it has the tendency to absorb the moisture in the air 
and become too hard to use. Remember, keep plenty on stock 
because recipes call for more that you might expect (usually 1 
or 2 cups at least).
There really isn't any substitute for baking soda or powder. 
Any variety of milk, whole or skim, can be used. The only 
difference is the richness, but in most recipes, it is undiscemable, and skim milk is considerably lower in fat. A good, 
fat-free substitute for cream is CoffeeMate liquid creamer. Not 
only is the fat and cholesterol much lower than cream, but so 
are the calories  and the taste and texture is just as rich.
As far as butter goes, any butter or margarine will do. The 
differences are mainly a matter of taste, although some of the 
new light margarines will change the texture of cookies, in 
particular, causing them to run. Cookies will also run if you use 
tubbed margarine. One tip is to freeze butter or margarine and 
grate into the recipe instead of softening it to room tempera
ture.
Many cake recipes call for oil. Vegetable, sunflower, or 
safflower oil are the most healthy choices, but an equal amount 
of unsweetened applesauce is a fat-free substitute which works 
just as well in most recipes. Low-fat yogurt is a good substitute 
for sour cream as well.
Vanilla extract is a common ingredient and is one of the 
more expensive necessities. When shopping, make sure to buy 
imitation instead of real, and a no-name brand if possible. Also,
12 \kar-neg-e\

---------------------------------------------------

almond oil can often be substituted. It makes almost no differ
ence in taste, but is a lot less expensive.
Once you have made these preparations, you are ready to 
bake.
Conventional ovens are by far the best way to bake. Micro
waves don't work well unless the recipe is specifically intended 
for them. Quick breads and cakes come in microwave form and 
contain the dish in the box. Otherwise, stick to a regular oven 
and the temperatures and times prescribed in the recipe. Baked 
goods, are especially sensitive to temperature. Raising the 
temperature to bake faster will only yield food that is burnt on 
the outside and uncooked in the middle.
If you have a recipe which specifically asks for a greased 
pan, or if you do not have coated bakeware, spray lightly with 
something like Pam. This is easy and saves fat and calories. 
When you pull your cake, cookies, or bread out of the oven, let 
it cool for about ten minutes before taking it out of the pan. 
(This is especially important with cakes, which have a tendency 
to fall apart when hot.) You also don't want your creation to be 
overly cooled.
Below are two great recipes. For cookie lovers, these will 
become a favorite even though the ingredients can get rather 
expensive the first time around. The popovers are simple and 
perfect with any meal.
Cinnamon Oatmeal Cookies
 1/2 cup raisins
 9 tablespoons butter, room temp.
3/4 cup sugar
 11/4 cups quick oats
 1 cup unsifted flour
 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Put raisins in a saucepan, 
cover with water and bring to a boil. Remove from heat and let 
stand for 10 minutes.
Drain raisins, pat dry, and chop coarsely. Cream butter and 
sugar until light and fluffy. Add the remaining ingedients and 
beat the mixture until smooth. Now, fold in the raisins.
Mold the dough into balls, place on greased or tephlon 
cookie sheet 11/2 inches apart, press down with a fork. Bake 6 
to 9 minutes, until they are golden brown.
Popovers
 6 eggs
 11/2 cups flour
 1 teaspoon salt
 1 /2 teaspoon pepper
 1 teaspoon thyme
 dash ground nutmeg
 2 cups milk
 1 /2 cup cream
After preheating oven to 400 degrees, smooth olive oil into 
muffin cups (you can do this with your finger).
Blend the eggs, flour, salt, pepper, thyme, and nutmeg. You 
can do this is a bowl, but a blender is easier. While stirring, add 
the milk and cream a bit at a time. Pour batter into each cup 
about 2/3 of the way.
Bake for about 45 minutes. They are finished when puffed 
and golden brown. Serve warmed.

NUTRITION
How to build a balanced meal
We've heard all about nutrition before, either from our 
mothers, or in some kind of health or basic science class. It's 
easy to forget, though, when you have to plan your own meals. 
As tempting as it may be to call a plate of nachos and salsa a 
balanced meal, it's just not enough. A well balanced diet is 
important to your health; that means you should know how to 
plan a nutritious, well balanced meal.
The easiest way to understand nutrition is by using the four 
food groups: fruits and vegetables; meat, fish and poultry; 
bread and cereals; and dairy products. In the course of a day, 
you should eat at least one member of each group. At first, it 
may seem difficult to work into your menu, but the groups are 
general enough to allow for lots of variations. Here are some 
examples: you can drink milk at any meal (it does a body 
good); eating a well-packed sandwich will knock off three 
groups at once (bread, vegetables, meat); and having fresh fruit 
as a snack during the day will supplement your diet with lots 
of vitamins.
Maintaining a diet high in carbohydrates, low in fat, 
moderate in protein, and drinking lots of water is another very 
important aspect of eating well. Carbohydrates, fat and protein 
are big sources of energy, and drinking lots of water (about 
eight glasses a day) is cleansing.
Carbohydrates can be found in whole grain breads and 
cereals, potatoes, and pasta, just to name a few. All these foods 
provide vitamins, minerals, and fiber. Carbohydrates can also 
be found in less nutritionally redeeming foods, like chocolate 
candies and cookies.
Fat is useful for giving you lots of energy without having to 
eat a lot of food; the key, however, is moderation. We all know 
what happens when you consume too much of it, but it may 
not occur to you that not having enough of it means not having 
enough energy.
Protein is important for tissue building and repair, and as a 
source of energy if your body doesn't have enough. Of course, 
meats, poultry and fish are good sources of protein; some other 
foods that are sources of protein are cheese, nuts, and eggs.
Chances are, if you're watching your weight, energy is the 
last thing on your mind. If you want to maintain your present
weight, just make sure your caloric intake doesn't exceed the 
amount of energy you use in a day. The Surgeon General also 
advises to use food preparation methods that add little or no 
fat, and to limit the amount of salt added.
Keep these things in mind when you're deciding what to 
cook. When you're grocery shopping, remember to read food 
labels. They inform you about the nutrient content of the foods 
you are going to eat. Be sure to look at the amounts of calories, 
protein, carbohydrates, fats, cholesterol, sodium, vitamins, and 
minerals the product contains. Remember to get at least one 
food from each of the food groups in your meals, and although 
time constraints might not always allow time for three meals a 
day, try to eat something for breakfast and lunch. You don't 
have to eat large amounts of food to have a balanced meal, but 
definitely try to eat enough to keep healthy.

HERBS AND SPICES
Cooking on a regular basis requires a wide variety of 
spices. Instead of buying every single spice you can imagine, 
start off with some of the most essential ones and slowly build 
a collection.
Most supermarkets like Giant Eagle have a whole rack of 
the basic spices. One thing to watch for is the ingredients, yes, 
even on spices. A lot of spices are really combinations of a large 
amount of salt and a little spice. Make sure you're buying what 
you want.
Certain spices, such as garlic, onions, and of course salt and 
pepper, will pop up in almost every recipe. Listed below are a 
bunch of spices. Use this list to see what goes well with foods 
you'll probably make the most.

(An excerpt from a work in progress)
My mother and I took off our coats and opened the menus.
I was in the mood for salad. I had been drinking the night before and 
felt like I was missing some major vitamins and minerals in my 
body. I lit a cigarette. The restaurant was very modem, all black and 
white. We ordered coffee and settled back to decide what to order.
This chicken salad sounds good. Give me a light, would 
you? she said, pulling out her cigarettes. We were both smoking so 
it was time to bond.
Mom, Im not eating meat, I answered and handed her the 
matches. She hated it when I gave up meat three years ago and 
always tried to push fish or chicken on me.
Oh, I forgot. Did you ever think that youre tired and worn 
out all the time because youre not getting enough protein?
No, because you eat meat and youre always tired, too. I 
just choose to stay up late doing work instead of getting the right 
sleep. Its a fact of college life, Mom.
Okay, but I hate it when you tell me things like Oh, I 
havent been to bed since Monday night. It worries me. You know, 
youre very hard on yourself and I wish you would take it easy 
sometimes. The pasta here is good, she said over her menu. I 
couldnt help but think she was the same way.
Its too fattening. I like working hard. Im never going to 
get anywhere by sitting around on my ass all the time. Where do you 
suppose I got this drive, anyway?
I concede, but that doesnt mean I have to stop worrying, 
does it?
Of course not, youre my mother for Christs sake. What the 
hell would you do all day if you didnt worry?
Play bingo, I guess. I would be a shitty mother if I didnt
worry about how much you eat and when you sleep. On the subject 
of worry ... Im not going to lecture, but you were drunk when you 
came home last night. And youve lost too much weight since 
Thanksgiving.
Yeah, I guess I was. I know I have to be more careful. 
Alcohol problems are all over the family. Ill take it easy. I think I 
look a lot better than I did at Thanksgiving.
You do look nice in that dress. I think Ill have the 
mushroom burger. Is it okay if I order meat in front of you?
No problem. I dont want to inflict my disgust for the 
needless slaughter of innocent animals for the culinary pleasure of 
human consumption on you, I smiled.
Fuck you, babe. I knew that college would turn you in to an 
artsyfartsy cause supporter, she laughed and got a relaxed, 
comfortable look on her face. She knew what I would say next. 
Fuck you, too, I laughed back at her.
Im shocked at your language. She was acting surprised. I 
dont know how to respond. Im confused and bewildered, she said 
as the waiter arrived. He was cute. We looked at each other then 
smiled at him and both started to flirt. He was too old for me and too 
young for her, but this was another routine of ours.
We have these familiar routines that make us laugh. The bit 
about being shocked after one or the other of us says fuck you is 
one of them. Its one of those things we do to show affection since 
Im too grown up to sit on her lap. Ill ask her if shes getting any 
and shell tell me I better not be. We have mother-daughter 
cigarettes. Shell pull the car forward as I reach for the handle to get 
in.

11 Before 1 write, I always read, always. I seldom ever sit down and just write. I always read some poems, and get some ideas. I 
think, oh, that was a good one, or how can I do something similar? I have certain poems that I read over and over again just 
because I like them. Even though I know what they're going to say, I still get excited about it. I think Its important to read. I 
think that's the only way you ever really learn.
I keep moving despite the weather 
and the cabins sad claiming 
of these dead acres,
and am not sure what it means when Jack 
says, Sound can l>e right or wrong

a Love Song in times of misbelief
you are my achilles heel 
a few feet higher.
you are the names of all my favorites, 
odysseus, 
perseus,
the african queen, 
you and bogart deep in the heart 
of africa.
you are the pictures in the newspaper, 
the people looming from the headlines, 
the boy who throws it into the hedge 
daily.
you are languages I cant speak, 
words I cant pronounce, 
names I cant remember, 
all the best places I can never find, 
you are the ringing-crystal and the whirling dances, 
the wobbly goblet and the old shoes, 
the squat mug and the easy chairs, 
the chipped jar,
the pile of silverware in the sink.
You are a long drink of water, 
you are a short road to walk, 
you are the path less traveled, 
the bridge too far.
You arc the impossible dream.
You are the girl next door,
Miss America,
Jackie O,
Venus in blue jeans.
You are right around the corner, 
you are on the street where you live.
And Im still waiting for
Dan Bidwa:
You realize that you're stealing events out of everyday life to stick 
in your poems and that you can do it competently . . . It's kind of 
disturbing when something happens to you, whether it's traumatic or 
not, and you're like, I can put this in a poem, I can use this! You 
start to see yourself as some sort of vampire ... I just had a 
relationship fall apart. I ended up asking myself, do I feel 
comfortable about using it in a poem? I find myself wanting to write 
about it because it seems like this big topic. I can see that if I 
handle it right, it can be something good.

/ have finished a hook of poems 
called Nobody Lives on Arthur 
Godfrey Boulevard. It has been 
solicited by txvo presses, each of which 
has had it for well over a year 
xuithout malting a decision. Needless 
to say, Carnegie Mellon University 
Press does not operate in this 
fashion. But all is not well with the 
state of poetry publishing. Part of the 
difficultly is that the Federal 
Government has gotten out of 
u niversity press publishing. The 
solution is going to be, as it was in 
the late 60s, for a number of people 
in their twenties to to establish small 
presses. I remain an optimist. I'm 
continuing to work on my nonficiton thriller, You Cant Win With 
That Here: Mouse Davis and the 
Run and Shoot Offense. The only 
current problem Im facing is the 
need to do research and time 
restrictions which preclude this. Its 
not going to be difficult to work out. 
As far as on-campus writing 
activities in which I'm involved are 
concerned, the Press published eleven 
books of poetry this year, including 
three in the new Carnegie Mellon 
Classic Contemporaries Series. My 
students have themselves been -

been getting more acceptances to 
graduate schools and more 
fellowships than any class in recent 
memory.

Michael Weinberger
the lizzy obsession
he service at the funeral home was quick and quiet. Afterwards, 
we followed the rabbi out of the small chapel through a side door into 
the parking lot. He escorted us to two black limousines which carried 
us out of the cemetery, only ten minutes away. Out among the stones at the 
Beth El graveyard, Lizzy held steadfastly to my arm. In accordance with a 
Jewish burial custom, the rabbi asked her if she wanted to shovel any dirt onto 
the coffin, and Lizzy at first, reluctant to let go of my arm, refused. But after a 
few of the others did it, and perhaps deciding that it was her last gesture 
towards her mother, she stepped forward and took the shovel from the rabbi.
I leaned forward and saw the coffin several feet down, with a few mounds of 
dirt lying on top of it. Lizzy thrust the shovel into the soil that was piled next to 
the hole. She lifted it with all her might, but as she lowered the dirt into the 
hole, the shovel slipped right out of her hands and into the coffin's pit. It made 
a thud as it landed on the coffin. Lizzy stared aghast into the grave, and the 
rest of the family stood helpless at her side. She broke out into huge gasping 
sobs. A brother or cousin came up to her and pulled her close to him. She 
stood back from the grave, still crying. The rabbi seemed flustered, fidgeting for 
a moment. He couldn't seem to decide what to do about the shovel that now 
rested comfortably on the coffin. Gathering his wits, he asked one of the 
graveyard attendants, who apparently stood by at all ceremonies in case of 
emergency, to fetch another shovel. Quickly a new shovel was delivered and 
the ceremony continued, the first shovel being buried along with Mrs. Gould . .. 
... Lizzy stared listlessly out at the road from behind the 
wheel. Resting my head back on the hard headrest, I wondered 
more about the dead Mrs. Gould. Had her children loved her? 
Obviously, she and Lizzy had not been close during her lifetime. 
What had she done to deserve to die such an awful death?
A heart attack. And to think she was only fifty-nine.
The shovel falling into the grave was perhaps the strangest of all 
occurrences. It was as if Lizzy had not dropped, but thrown, the 
shovel in. As if, in her heart, there was no way that her young 
mother could be gone. As if gathered around were the most ruthless 
of people, conspiring to bury her alive the woman who had raised her, 
the only girl, the only female link. Lizzy had thrown the shovel into the grave 
like a sailor throwing a life preserver to a drowning mate. Her mother could now 
crawl, weak but alive from the coffin and dig her way back to the surface. She could 
laugh in the faces of those who had thought her dead. She could return to mother 
Lizzy. To say it's all right, Mother will hum a lullaby.
(an excerpt from a work in progress)
"Writing a novel is an even bigger job than I thought it was going to be. Its incredibly big. Initially, I 
was thinking I could sit down and write the text of a novel in three, four weeks, I could get it all out 
during the summer, and then have all year to revise and fine tune. It just doesn't work that way. Once 
you get started, you realize that the development of a novel takes a long time, it kind of grows along 
with you, and I think that you need that time. Ideas change. My novel right now does not have the same 
outlook as it did during the first month that I was working on it, and if I had completed the whole thing 
during that month, it would probably be a much different piece." -Michael Weinberger

JIM DANIELS, Professor:
I think the one thing that I can't teach that's 
been frustrating is self-discipline and motivation. 
Ive had some very talented writers that didn't 
have the inner drive to continue. In other words, 
as soon as they got out of college, they never 
wrote again. That's fine because maybe that 
means they weren't meant to be writers, but It's 
sort of frustrating when you see somebody so 
talented giving up on it. Some people are just 
lazy even though they say they want to be a wr 
iter, they just dont do it on their own. I think the 
people who are successful are the ones who 
work hard at it and write even when they don't 
have a deadline hanging over their head. The 
people who can't stop writing, who force 
themselves to sit down. If you wait for the 
perfect moment of Inspiration, you'll be waiting 
forever. You really have to nudge the Muse 
along, say, when I'm sitting down to write, you 
better show up.""
Night Light
for Mrs. Francis
Up late again, I sit on the toilet
flicking your night-light
on and off in the little pink bathroom
under the stairs. I am writing
on the little scraps of paper
you left by the phone.
We do not use the night-lights 
you left to dot the halls.
We are taking care
of your old house. Last week
we bought a bedroom set off an old widow
moving in with her brother. Cherry wood.
Maybe you know her? Mrs. Santoro.
A scapular hung over the bedpost 
it must have been her husbands.
I gently lifted it, draped it 
over a stack of boxes.
I wanted to put that scapular on.
Can you understand that? I wanted 
to drape it over my neck 
and say a few prayers for him, 
for you, for old people everywhere 
selling off their goods.
Are you done with the treatments, 
has your hair grown back in?
Will it ever? I worship everywhere.
In the kitchen I pray to the vase you left, 
the ceramic woman's head. Her earrings 
have dropped off. I have made her 
a pair of sunglasses and taped them on 
so she will not see us scuff your floors.
Sometimes we still come across a note 
you left usinstructions for the stove, 
the furnace, the floodlights, the locks.
1 heard how the gypsies robbed you 
when you let them use your phone.
But thats not why you sold this 
for a prayer.
The absence of your grandfather clock 
ticks in the hallway. You called to ask 
for the catalogs you use to shop.
Wed thrown them out. We are young 
and small in this big house 
but we will fill it up with our dust and sins.
In this tiny room under the stairs 
I flick off the light and step out 
into the dark hall, feeling my way.
It is time again to dump the bag of keys 
you left, to finger your old bones.
(reprinted from Kenyon Review)
"Sometimes as a way of preparing for writing, I'll 
do some reading, or I'll write letters, something 
that will calm me down. You need some kind of 
transitional thing. If I get home from school for 
example, I just can't sit down and start writing. I 
have to have some kind of transitional thing that 
will ease me down a little bit. get me beneath the 
surface of things a little.";eC zy8eomU

"All the time, I'll start a story, and I wont go anywhere with it, but Ill never erase it because I think it's bad luck. / used to 
think it was wasting space on my disk, why don't 1 just throw it out? Now, Im working on this story, and I was kind of stumped for an 
image, but I couldnt quite put my finger on how I wanted to express it, and I was thinking, oh. Ill just clear off some space on this disk 
just to do something. I had six first paragraphs to different stories in different files. I started reading through them to figure out what 
was the most useless thing to delete. Looking through my old beginnings, / found some of the coolest things that I had forgotten about. 
Ive got this file of worthless fiction, but in each page of worthless fiction is an idea or an image, maybe just a few sentences that work 
really well together. I found something I wrote when I was like a Sophomore where this one woman goes into a garden and decapitates 
all the flowers. She takes a pair of pruning shears and just cuts all the tops off all the flowers, and then she thinks that they look really 
pretty so she gathers up all the flowers and puts them in a fish bowl. That's what I was looking for, is someone who runs around and 
cuts the heads off of all the flowers, and I got a chance to use it."

(An excerpt from a work in progress)
Daria stopped at the window. Sister 
Agatha was shuffling down the brick-lined path 
to the garden, her black habit lifted off her 
shoulders by the wind. She was carrying 
something bulky that weighed her down so that 
she moved with a lurch. Daria rubbed the cuff of 
her sleeve to clear a spot in the window and 
shifted her position against the sill, resting her 
breasts on her folded arms.
At the point where the path branched 
away from the house, Sister paused and knelt by 
the tulip bed. She was facing Daria at the 
window, but her face was bowed and hidden 
from Darias view. Sister set a large pair of 
pruning shears down beside the tulips. Daria 
leaned forward, surprised, and her breath fogged 
a circle in the glass. She recognized the shears. 
They were the oldest pair of the house, the 
blades dulled and red with rust, and they were 
meant to stay hidden at the back of the garage 
behind disused shovels, green loops of garden 
hose, and dented wheelbarrows. Sister Agatha 
should not have been able to find them.
Daria wiped the pane clean again. Sister 
was bent over kneeling, picking up handfuls of 
soil and sifting them through her fingers. She 
looked to be saying something, but the closed
window shut Daria off from the sounds, and she 
could hear only her own breathing. She 
wondered if she should go out and see what 
Sister was doing. It looked cold outside, and a 
wind played with Sisters habit and swayed the 
tulip heads back and forth. It was warm and still 
inside.
As Daria rearranged herself at the 
window, she watched Sister begin to sway. 
Sister moved rhythmically, as if she was one of 
the flowers bending in the wind. Framed in 
Darias pane, the black shape of Sister Agatha 
seemed to be leading the bright spots of 
yellows, reds, and pinks in a solemn dance. 
Daria almost felt herself move along with them.
Sister Agatha broke the rhythm abruptly. 
She propped the pruning shears in the soil and 
leaned against them to help herself up, then 
picked up the shears and brushed dirt from the 
blades. She leaned forward and caught the stem 
of one red tulip. Cupping the flower in her hand, 
she rubbed the petals between her fingers for a 
moment, then stepped back and reached out 
with the shears. She snipped the head off the 
flower.
Daria jumpea. Sister! She rapped on 
the window with her knuckles, then slapped
both palms against the cold glass. Sister 
Agatha! Sister did not look up. She aimed the 
shears at the next tulip, and a yellow head joined 
the red one on the ground at the base of the 
stems. Then another red. A pink. Two yellows 
side by side. Sister moved down the row, flower 
by flower, carefully catching each at the point 
where the head joined the stem. Daria felt like 
she was stuck to the floor. Her skin was 
suddenly cold and she clenched her fists at her 
side with each new cut, imagining she was 
hearing the rusty blades snap together. She 
wanted to run to the door, but she could not take 
away her eyes.
At the border of the flower bed Sister 
Agatha dropped the shears and stepped back. 
Before her, rows of pale green stems pointed 
stiffly at the sky. The earth, churned by her 
footsteps, was a mottled mass of brown soil and 
flashes of brilliant color. Here and there clumps 
of flower heads that landed together were rolled 
along the ground by the wind. Daria saw Sister 
Agatha nod, and then she broke her freeze. She 
ran to the door as Sister picked up the shears 
again and headed down the path that led to the 
rest of the garden.

The two men started fighting in the bar at two in the 
afternoon, for reasons found at the confessional end of a twelvepack. The burly bartender told them to take it outside. Well have 
no such horse-shit in here! This look like a pasture to you? They 
drained their beer cans and walked out into the glare of the sun. The 
early crowd followed, and bets were laid with the odds favoring 
Benny Shaver, the taller and heavier of the two.
Benny was a lazy fighter, who knew the advantage that his 
two-hundred pounds gave him. He said, Ill teach you to slander 
my woman. Ready to get your ass kicked, son? And Blake 
Caldwell said, Bring it on.
Benny charged with his head down. Onlookers described it 
later as a directed trudge. Blake, who was nearly as drunk, stepped 
quickly, if not too neatly, out of the way. Benny tripped off the curb, 
but managed to catch himself against a parked car before stumbling 
into the street. A coal truck roared by the place where Benny would 
have been, had he not caught himself.
Blake said, Hey, maybe this aint such a great idea. She 
aint worth fighting over. Lets get another beer before one of us gets 
killed. He approached Benny, to help him inside.
Benny shouted, Wll buddy, you started it! Turnin yellow 
on me? and swung his right fist at Blakes head. Blake ducked, and 
tried to push Bennys arms down to his sides.
Seriously, Benny. Somebodys gonna get hurt. Blake 
started to walk towards the door of the bar. Money was changing 
hands.
Benny walked up behind Blake and said, Yeah. You. 
Youre the one thats going to get hurt. He pushed Blake, stiff
armed, into the side of the doorway.
Blakes head rebounded from the wooden frame of the door 
with an audible crack. He shook his head and turned to face Benny. 
He couldnt see his eyes, but Bennys head was silhouetted against 
the afternoon sky. I told you I didnt want to do this, but this is for 
your own good. His right fist came forward with a sharp jab, and 
it connected with Bennys face just below the nose.
Benny lost the fight that Friday when his two upper incisors 
were knocked out. It wasnt the pain that did him in, or the shame. 
In fact, the instant that it happened Benny ran his tongue over the 
new gap, and grinned. His mistake came when he swallowed the 
teeth, instead of spitting them out. The teeth lodged sideways in his 
throat, and his grin quickly faded as his face turned blue and he 
began gasping. He put his hands around his neck, trying to squeeze 
the teeth out like hed milk a cow, but it was no use. He stared 
impotently into the brilliant blue sky of early June, then fell over 
backwards, his breath whistling out around his misplaced teeth as 
his back hit the sidewalk. Fortunately for him, the same shock also 
caused the teeth to fly out of his throat, over the heads of the 
onlooking crowd, and into the pink blossoms of Mrs. Wilsons 
nearby potted azalea bush, which was nearly as famous in Sutton, 
West Virginia, as her organically-grown, hand-picked, sun-dried 
marijuana.
Blake extended a hand to help Benny to his feet. Damn it, 
Benny, you gave me a scare. I thought Id killed you! he said.
Benny couldnt say anything just yet. As he stood up, the 
blood started gushing from his mouth. From the way he winced 
when he held his handkerchief up to his mouth to try to stop the flow, 
you could tell it was beginning to hurt a bit, too.
Blake said, Cmon. Lets go inside and get you some ice for 
that. He tried to steer Benny into Wilsons Bar and Grill by the 
elbow, but Benny shook him off and mumbled something into his 
handkerchief. The sounds bubbled out in a red froth.
Blake said, What the hell you tryin to say?
Benny moved the handkerchief away from his mouth, and a 
small cascade of blood spattered on the sidewalk. Benny didnt look 
down. Wherescth my teescth? he asked.
A boy of about six, wearing a yellow CAT cap that came 
down past his ears, pointed to the azalea bush. No one paid him 
any attention, so he yelled, Hey! and pointed again. Blake 
looked from the boy to the bush, then to Benny. For a minute, 
nobody moved, then Blake walked over to the azalea, parted the 
stiff, green leaves near the bottom, and found the teeth. Without 
a word he took them over to Benny, tucked them into his shirt 
pocket, and walked away. Benny didnt say anything, either; he 
just walked across the street to Doc Piersons, the dentist, to see
if he could maybe put the teeth back in.

"The problem I used to have in my uniting is that 1 would try to explain things 
too much. I'd get this monumental metic idea and then there'd he all this trash in 
my poem trying to explain why I thought of it or how I made the connection. 
What 1 have been doing now, which is more effective, is to get this weird 
connection or idea and act like it is the most obvious thing in the world, and then 
mite about it50 obvious as to be self evident. I came up with this poem once 
that started being about stray dogs and ended up about being, well at least the 
way I read it, a poem about patriotism. You can't explain why stray dogs are like 
people who are patriotic. You have to just start from there, set it down and keep 
going. You can't waste time explaining things to people."
"You know, these days, I write in the bathroom. At home, in my apartment, I'll 
sit in the bathroom and write. The first time I did it, I ended up writing a poem 
about the bathroom, but it has expanded since then. I guess because the 
bathroom is the room of weird personal habits and poetry is kind of a weird 
personal habit."
The thin film over their eyes 
means they're too old, 
they have cataracts and run

dazed. When they trot 
off sideways they're masking 
a limp, an old wound

They don't chase cars

they don't come when called, 
they'11 only eat

them into the house, their final 
resting place will be on the sofa 
in front of the TV. They'll go bald

The day I heard Buddy Collins had gone to 
New Orleans, I was chased home from the bus stop by 
a cold front that blackened the afternoon sky in an 
instant. Only flashes of lighting made me stop to cringe 
before I continued running through the back yards of 
Hunting Ridge.
Through the side door into the kitchen, I 
came inside and shivered, drenched, my arms pressed 
against my sides for warmth. The air conditioning made 
my body condensed and hard, my skin thick. I could tell 
the dining room lights were on, although I could not see 
around the corner into the room. The storm had filled 
the house with a sullen darkness. Then I heard Mrs. 
Jennings voice from the dining room, it was an 
unmistakable accent from the South. My mother did not 
like Mrs. Jennings muchshe referred to her in front of 
me as Peg" instead of Mrs. Jennings, but that never 
stopped her from inviting Mrs. Jennings in.
I could have killed that Mary Lou Collins last 
night," Mrs. Jennings said.
And I stopped walking.
I had only ever spoken to Mrs. Jennings 
directly once, years before. I had been walking through 
her yard when she motioned me over with the spray 
bottle she was using to wet her tanning stomach. I was 
made to loiter. "See that," Mrs. Jennings had asked me,- 
pointing to her foot, to a small crescent of skin lifted 
away from her tea-stained ankle, not a wart but some 
inconsistency. "Thats a beauty mark." Her fingers 
cradled a cigarette while she pointed. Do you think it 
makes me pretty?"
"Yes, Mrs. Jennings," I said. I was ten and 
not quite sure what was pretty.
Really, Johnny Strutter, do you think that 
little beauty mark on my ankle means I'm pretty?"
Sure, I said.
I mean, realty, Johnny ..
Mrs. Jennings was talking about Mrs. 
Winklesteins party in our dining room. My mother was 
listening, I think.
So what else could go wrong? The food was 
lousy, and the cork screw had broken in the wine bottle. 
What else could possibly happen? Well, Linda, the cake 
was left. Pam had this cake, beautiful, I think it was one
(An excerpt from a work in progress)
2 8 n e
of the most beautiful cakes I have ever seen, and it was 
big, too. She must have spent a fortune. Now I cannot 
say, maybe she didn't know the bottom layer of the 
cake was made of ice cream. I mean, maybe Pam just 
did not know. We have to give her the benefit of the 
doubt here. The woman needs all the help she can get. 
So she wants us all to eat cake because we couldn't 
drink the wine, and she goes into the kitchen, and the 
whole thing had slid right off of the dishwasher. It was 
all over the floor. Youve never seen such a mess, and 
Pam started crying when she saw it. I dont blame her. 
Jesus, Linda, what do I care if Pam wants a little cry, 
but that Mary Lou Collins goes in, all to the rescue. You 
know how she is about womens issues,' and she's 
consoling Pam, saying 'It's okay, its okay,' and I just 
walked into the kitchen. I didn't even say anything. And 
Mary Lou says to me, Just leave, Peg, okay, just leave 
her alone. What did she think I was going to do? Ask 
for a piece of cake?"
I heard Mrs. Jennings' lighter flick and then 
rattle on the surface of the dining room table. "Do you 
see now why Im angry? I should have told her to stick it 
up her ass, Linda. I really should have. God, I was so 
mad. At least I know where my boys are, I wanted to 
say, At least my kids dont have to run away from 
home. Shes obviously doing something wrong, 
something to drive them away. I mean, when was the 
last time you heard she saw Buddy?"
I walked over to the dishwasher, pressed a 
rough silver button, started the cycle. The sound of 
water trickling into the machine competed with the 
resonance of rain splashing down outside.
I don't know, Peg, my mother said. Do you 
remember how cute Buddy was when he was a boy? 
God, he was handsome. I remember you telling me 
how unfair it was for anyone to have such a good 
looking child.
Oh, I did not."
You did, we were sitting right here. We were 
watching Donna. Johnny wasn't even born yet.
Did I?"
We were right here, Peg. I remember. You 
said Buddy was too beautiful to be a boy, all that curly 
blond hair, he should have been a girl."
fled
"Well, I wasn't far off."
The dishwasher churned into the wash cycle 
with startling volume. I pressed my hands up against it, 
felt its warmth and the movement within.
"You know, once when Buddy was little, he 
rang my door-bell, and when I answered it, he had a 
snake in his hand. It had got run over in the street, a 
garden snake, long green thing, perfectly flat, like a 
sheet of paper. He was holding it up, Look, he said,
'it's deaded,' and he was so cute, so ... curious, you 
just wanted to take him in your arms and love him to 
death. I told him to put the snake down immediately, 
though, and I made him come in and wash his hands. I 
told him he could get sick, to never pick up dead 
animals." My mother grunted. The kid didnt know any 
better."
If he didnt know any better, its because of 
that mother of his," Mrs. Jennings said.
"Peg, he was a kid. Kids pick up things like 
that all the time." ^
"I wouldnt let my kids be outside picking up 
road kill and bringing it to a neighbors house. What 
could have been going through his mind? Anyway, what 
do I care about Buddys life? I don't care Linda, 
honestly. Hey, it's a free country. And wherever he is 
now, he can be whatever he wants. If he wants to run 
off to New Orleans and leave his mother, although I 
cant entirely blame him, if he wants to do it, hey, its 
fine with me."
And then they were quiet. My teeth chattered 
in the cold air of the kitchen even though blood churned 
around inside me so fast that I felt off balance. I was 
safe from the lightening but freezing to death.
"Of course, Buddy is one of those."
My mother said it.

an excerpt from a work in progress 
by Benjamin Donnelly
Hed had plenty of drunks try starting conversations with him 
on the night bus, and now it was his turn. You ever have a big 
coincidence happen to you? Chris asked the passenger on the seat next 
to him, a middle-aged balding man in a wool coat, who continued to 
stare straight ahead. You ever run into something really weird? Chris 
said.
After midnight, mid-week, so the bus was close to empty, just 
himself, this man, the conductor, and two women on the seats across 
from them. It was an old-style bus, with the stairs and exit in the back, 
open to the air, woodwork around the window frames. The night was 
pleasant enough for March, wet but not rainy, and hed unzipped his 
motorcycle jacket and enjoyed the breeze that swept through the cabin.
He was still drunk. Catford was still on the other side of South London.
He had plenty he didnt want to think about, and felt perfectly justified 
to start up a conversation with the guy next to him, although he 
continued to twist in his seat.
Yeah. The weirdest thing happened to me a couple of days 
ago. He nodded his head. I was on the train back to Catford...
The man turned to him and said, Are you American or 
Canadian?
Uh. American.
The man looked away, blank-faced again.
I was on the train back to Catford. Chris felt an idea in his 
head. Wait, are you American?
No.
Canadian?"
No, Im English. Still staring ahead.
Oh. You sounded American there, to me, for a second.
Im English. The man stood and pulled the stop bell.
See you around. Have a nice day.
The man nodded and left.
Have a nice day, Chris said to the women on the seats across 
from him. Have a nice day. Im an American, cant you tell? We all 
say, Have a nice day. Were so insincere. He mumbled have a nice 
day to himself, and leaned back sideways on the bank of seals that ran 
beneath the windows. They didnt hear him. They sat next to one 
another, but seemed intent on ignoring each others presence, not just 
his. One was teenaged, and still wearing a school uniform, though over 
a tee-shirt. The older one was at least thirty, maybe older, tired skin, 
hair permed to the point of abuse, end of the day make-up. They sat too 
close to not know each other. ^ ^ \
Then the girl vomited on the floor. Jflfc * 4
Oh Christ, not again, the other said, before the girl had 
finished. You get what you deserve. Whatd I tell you? Youre a 
fucking baby. Whats your mum gonna say when she catches a whiff of 
you? Look at yourself, you look disgusting.
The girl kept her head between her legs and made choking
sounds.
Thats it, get it all out. Youll fucking feel better, but I doubt 
it. Youre a fucking baby. Youll remember this night for the rest of 
your life. Maybe youll learn your limit someday. I doubt it. Youre a 
fucking baby. Get youself all pissed, and youve been puking since the 
pubs closed. Acting like a fucking tart just to get them to buy you 
another pint. Whats your mum gonna say to me, bringing you home? 
Youll probably still be throwing up. You probably wont stop 
throwing up for days. Just like a baby.
The girl let loose what seemed like a gallon. Her sister, if they 
were sisters, rolled her eyes and removed some tissues from her purse. 
You fucking got it all over your uniform. Here, clean your lapel. Im 
not fucking touching you. You fucking baby.
The girl looked up, teary-eyed, and brushed the front of her 
blazer. Chris looked away, noticing the conductor, an old black man, 
hanging out of the bus by the pole in the door. He was looking at the 
night or avoiding the situation or avoiding the smell, which was taking 
the place of the misty air. The puddle was expanding in rows, carried 
by the rubber grip ridges on the floor. Nothing could be done, actually. 
There were no other passengers. The bus wasnt stopping. The girl let 
fly again, and everything splashed in the same spot.
Did you eVen piss once this evening? Do you even digest? 
the older woman asked. I cant believe how much youve been 
carrying around. Chris was beginning to feel queasy himself, 
sympathetic nausea. The bus was indeed beginning to smell like one 
huge baby.
The conductor pulled himself in, Where you all be going 
tonight?
Peckham, the woman called.
Catford, Chris said.
Catford? the conductor asked.
Yeah.
This bus dont go to Catford, it goes on to Greenwhich. 
Naw, Chris said, standing up and zipping his jacket. Shit. 
Sorry, mate, you can get off in Lewisham.
I know, I know, he repeated, then jumped out the back of 
the moving bus.

like she gets a flat

played by Sam Shepard 
-am I right?- 
He shows up.
He just happens 
to be driving by

She doesnt let 
him help and she fixes 
-this makes her a modern 
woman-the tire herself.
All this while 
my cat is bleeding, 
rolling around the back 
seat of my Chevy.
Later at the post office 
the woman runs into Sam 
Shepard. She thinks about 
how he is charming 
despite his slight limp 
and how shes changed 
since she moved out 
to the country and learned 
how to fix a broken tire.
They end up getting together. 
The movie ends.
I took my cat to the vet

other women like me 
waiting for our cats 
to finally shut up.

saying that she thinks there are times when your brain is working on things. You can't necessarily
get them on paper, but you're working on them, and I believe that. I
always believe you can start something, then leave it for a couple of days, and go back. Right

So This 
is Long 
Island
Since last year, Ive written about 10 stories, and theyve all taken place on Long Island. I started 
writing the stories as an answer to anti-suburban short stories. Im not writing to valorize suburbia. I 
have characters w ho sort of really like where they:re :li.ving,:and lake issue iol'ithaL ;I think il!s;almost 
an easy trick to write about suburbia from the point of view of someone whos better than it all, who 
knows better. I would like ,to get .a .different side of the issue.
I want 10 get this right.
At La G uardia I pick up three guys 
in suits with tans and southern accents who 
have to go out to'the Marriott in Suffolk 
County for an airplane convention. The 
meter blip; the first one-seventh of a mile, 
and because of construction on die north 
ramp and the usual traffic, we are stuck in 
the airport for a half hour, boxed bumperto 
bumper in lanes of orange cones and six 
foot concrete dividers. Shit, I mutter to 
myself. The southern guys dont mind the 
wait.
So this is New York," one qf 
them says.
We are on Long Island, I say.
They are drinking litde bottles of 
airline whiskey. Theonesitting in ihecenter, 
a tall good-looking guy, has his arms spread 
out across the back scat, and occasionally 
he rubs his hands through the hair of his 
partners or punches their shoulders. The 
other two call him Dodi. Dodi talks the 
loudcsL A Mexican gardener has gotten 
their bosss wife pregnant., and some girl, 
Debbie, looks sexy even when she wears 
sweaters, although she is a certified manhater. We pass the sight of the 1962 Worlds 
Fair and Robert Moses giant aluminum 
globe. The three arc not impressed. They 
are busy listing Debbies ex-lovers.
Then Dodi leans over the scat to 
talk to me. On his middle finger he spins 
this small plastic neon orange doughnut, 
the same color as the cones at La Guardia. 
It looks like a big marble will) a hole drilled 
in it.
Can you guess what this is?" he
asks me.
I act like I can only manage a 
quick glance, not enough to respond. He 
smells like he is sweating alcohol.
Its a new age golf ball, he says. 
I invented it. It is going to make me my 
first million before Im thirty.
His buddy pulls him back. He is 
not so good-looking, short and stocky, tar 
black hair. Not as drunk either. Were 
valve salesmen, he says in a friendly voice. 
They go back to talking like Im not there, 
but the airline whisky runs out and Dodi' 
complains and gets nasty.
You two dont know fun from a 
hole in my ass," he says.
Cool down, the other two tell him, 
dont ruin the weekend. They make 
allowances because he is drunk. But Dodi 
doesnt w-ant to cool down.
At least Debbie has an interesting 
life. She isnt boring like you two, he says.
His friends give up trying to talk to 
him. They pretend not to listen and look out 
their windows at the shopping centers and 
parking lots. Dodi runs out of steam and the 
cab is suddenly quiet.
AtaredlightonSunriscHighway, 
I take a long look back at them in the rear
view mirror. Their suits arc rumpled, lies 
hang loose, hair all messed up, and they
have such serious looks on their faces as if 
their lives arc so important.I cant help but 
smile.
You guys look like you want to 
go to McQuades," I say.
What? theblack-haired guy says 
in an angry voice.
An Irish yuppie bar. Its just the 
place you guys are looking-for. It gets wild 
on Friday nights.
Women? Dodi asks. He has 
come back to life.
Hot, real foxes. I should know. I 
drive them home when theyve had too 
much."
Were there, he says. He pats 
me on the shoulder and probably would 
have mussed my-hairif I had any. All three 
slap hands and are friends again. Dodi even 
apologizes to me.
I pull uprighiat the front entrance. 
The electric shamrock glows green on their 
faces as they watch three women in summer 
dresses show their I.D.s to the bouncer. The 
bass line of the song playing inside thumps 
like my fat son running down stairs. I have 
never been inside, not my kind of place.
What about our luggage? the 
black-haired guy says. "We cant take thai 
in with us. He isnt exactly sold on the 
idea. I tell them Ill drop off their luggage at 
the Marriott and give them my companys 
number. Dodi reminds him of-tfle-women. 
Three of them and three of us, he says, and 
the black-haired guy gives in. The fare is 
twenty-two dollars,and they givcjnethiny 
and let me keep the change. I give them a
receipt.
Dodi lingers after the other two 
have left the cab. He hands me the plastic 
doughnut and in an almost sad voice says, 
You'sell the patent rights to Grumman and 
make a fortune, say you invented it."
I unclasp my St. Christophers 
medal and loop the doughnut on the chain 
like it is a high school ring. It hangs on my 
neck, bright and orange. I grin at Dodi, and 
he laughs and gives me a firm handshake.
After work, 3 go to Nightwings 
and have three beers and three whiskeys. 
On my way home I stop my car in the 
middle of the Atlantic Avenue bridge. The 
orange doughnut sails far out into the bay. 
Far enough that I have already regained my 
balance and stand perfectly still and watch 
it make a liny splash in the green black 
water. Too light for a golf ball, I think.
Then I sit down on the hood of my 
car. Off in the distance I can see the brightly 
lit softball fields ai Baldwin Park. The beer 
leagues arc playing ihcir Friday night 
doublcheadcrs. Theplayers look like painted 
ants circling the bases and ihe crowds in die 
stands arc flies, buzzing. From this distance 
nothing hit 10 the outfield looks like it is 
going over the fence.
The cop asks me what die problem
is.
What does it look like? I say in 
my best cabdrivcrs voice.

a scared little girl 
only eight years old 
hustled downstairs 
to neighbors

two tiny chalk white pills 
a dixie cup of water 
the aftertaste of waxy cardboard
the pain abates 
deadly calm washes over me 
i step out of my body 
and watch myself sleep

Its been good that 
Ive read
some of the old stuff, 
but I dont

her look of anguish 
pushing me away
i stand 
empty and confused

Into account very much

me that thats part of the

d> i I \/\/o rt: Iwas fifteen, and Curt Canard asked me if I wanted to ride in the trunk 
of Sue McKendrick's white LeMans with him. I had just moved to the suburbs, 
and his invitation was full of possibilities. I pulled the phone away from my 
mother's shouts and told Curt yes. Whatwas he crazy? Of course I wanted to 
ride in the trunk of Sue McKendrick's white LeMans with him.
My mother was in the middle of another kitchen utensil battlethis 
time yelling at the electric can openerand seemed unconcerned when I told 
her that nothing in the world had made me happier than moving out of Detroit 
into this wonderful city where the mailman didn't even get out of his truck to 
deliver the mail.
"Don't get used to this place," she warned. A native Detroiter, my 
mother did not trust the suburbs.
"There's nothing here to like," she complained daily. "These places 
don't even have their own names." She was talking about Birmingham, Beverly 
Hills, Berkeley, Rochester, all suburbs of Detroit, but names that she thought 
belonged to real cities, not hiding places.

Sharon Dilzvorth, Professor:
"I spent a lot of time writing this really non-moving 
fiction, no one did anything. It was these women 
where their guys had left them, either husbands or 
boyfriends, and they were alone in these apartments 
usually with their cats. They would just sit there and 
think, but to me that ivas the zuay I thought you were 
supposed to write fiction, and yet no woman I kneiv 
would sit there in her apartment and talk to her cats 
after her guy had left. So I started writing about the 
people I kneiu ... Hike people who have strong 
personalities. I am attracted to people who are strong, 
that have strong belie, are obsessive. Those are my 
friends, and since I hang around those people, that's 
who I ivrite about."
"Ive always been a liar, since I zvas a kid. I always 
made up stories. Ive ahvays told lies. My brother and 
I used to have this saying, Why tell the truth when a 
lie will do?' That made perfect sense. The most 
entertaining thing I think you can do is to tell stories 
back and forth. Writing is an extension ofthat. "
For someone who called her pots and pans by the names of the Apostles, 
I questioned her reasoning, but this was not her rational side. It would be years 
before I understood that her slamming the frying pan back and forth across the 
gas burner screaming, "Jesus, John. Matthew is boiling his water. Can't you 
brown the hamburger meat like Paul used to do?" was only an excuse to take 
the Lord's name in vain. She did not like the kitchen, and she particularly did 
not like a kitchen in a house fifteen miles north of the Detroit River.
This was 1974. My new friends and I were sophomores at Ernest 
W. Seaholm High School. Total enrollment was 2700, and every single one of 
us was white except Billy Brooks and his twin sister Elizabeth. Football games 
and cheerleaders were queer, and smoking pot was pretty much a junior high 
thing. Beer was bigboth a day and night beverageand that year we wore an 
androgynous uniform of Levi corduroys, blue or white button downs, and 
desert boots.
The school administration, tired of a decade of protesting students, 
started an open attendance policythey no longer cared how many days we 
were there or how many we skipped. Learning was not popular, and going 
to class became the exception. We spent most of that academic year in a car.
Our parents worked for General Motors, Ford, Chrysler, or American Motors, 
and there was always an available car.
The only thing suburban Detroit didn't provide for us in 1974 was 
excitement. Our days were easy, loaded with free time, our cares and concerns 
seemed trivialwe worried about going metric. None of us were quite sure 
how to convert, and it made us nervous.
We took on the responsibility of providing the danger we felt we 
deserved, and one day came up with the idea of driving across the Canadian 
border, two or more people smuggled in the trunk of the car. The thing that 
made this act so dangerous, so exciting, was that we had no idea what would 
happen if we got caught.

Donna just bought a new sports car. 
As we zoom down Interstate 77, she moves it 
into fifth gear and the little streak easily 
doubles the top speed of her previous ride, a 
busted and rusty tank of an Oldsmobile. Tiny 
puffs of air are sneaking by the seals of the 
closed windows, but the roar is only 
noticeable between songs. Otherwise, Donna 
keeps the stereo cranked with new groups 
whose names I havent heard of and whose 
bass lines are making the interior shake and 
pound like a bad headache.

(An excerpt from a work in progress)
by Mark Schmick
Suddenly she thrusts her hand 
behind her into the pile of debris on the back 
seat. She roots around for a moment, then 
brings her hand back gripping a tape jacket. 
She takes her eyes off the road a moment to 
look at it, then tosses it back into the pile. She 
thrusts her hand back and roots again. This 
time she brings up a book. She passes the 
book to me and turns down the radio. The 
melody submerges but the bass remains, 
thumping softly.
Have you read this? she asks.
I look at the title: The History of 
Luminous Motion, by Scott Bradfield.
Never heard of it.
She nods her head vigorously. Its 
yours. Its good. Read it. She turns up the 
radio once again. Donna is a remarkable 
dancer, even sitting down; she begins rotating 
her head in a set of groovy ellipses. I reach 
forward and turn the radio back down.
Well? Whats it about?"
I dont know. I cant tell you, 
anyway. Just read it!
She turns up the volume with a hard 
twist. End of discussion. She resumes her 
rubber-necking and I leaf curiously through 
the first couple of pages, as we continue our 
lawless rush down the freeway.
I didnt turn the rest of the pages 
until a few months later. It turned out to be 
the worst type of book for me to read. For the 
most part, nascent writers like myself prefer 
books that are hopelessly bad. We can look 
upon those malpractices as shining beacons 
of hope for our own poor efforts; in fact we 
rally around them like witch-burners. But 
Bradfields book was no such fodder. It was 
one of those despised good books that fan our 
insecurities to a fever pitch. But I read it 
anyway. Distasteful as it was, one needs a 
diet of intellectual roughage.
The main character in the story is a 
small boy named Philip who has a desperate 
attachment to his mother. His love for her soars 
beyond any language of the concrete; she does 
not occur for him as a mere tangle of arms and 
legs and breasts. To Philip, she is never-ending 
motion, all-pervading light, 
sits back and watches his investment, while the 
American is on the edge of his seat, demanding 
dividends. This fuels the American focus on 
short-term goals, immediate profits, slipshod 
production. But Donna is different. She allows 
her life the dignity of its path, sometimes quick, 
sometimes long, often arduous. And yet she 
remains patient, like water cutting a valley, 
carefully bending her ear as always to listen, 
listen.
Everyone in the U.S. is in therapy. 
They are in therapy because they resist change 
and that resistance is driving them crazy. 
Theyre not adaptable. And yet when Donna 
needs to get away from her childhood, she 
packs her packs and moves from Seattle to 
Cleveland. When shes tired of being a 
shoeshine at the Holiday Inn, she becomes  
scrub nurse at Saint Lukes. I thank God that I 
never know where Donna will be or what she 
will be doing. I can count on her.
One problem that Americans have with 
therapy is that they find out everything about 
themselves. And once everything is found out 
they go and tell their friends. Soon their friends 
know everything too, and they tell their friends, 
and pretty soon theres nothing left to know.
But Donna is different. And for her sake I wont 
tell you how.

"One of the things that I've learned in the program here is that I don't really rely on inspiration very much when I write. I don't think that you walk around and inspiration hils 
you. Inspiration comes from inside the writing process."
