A fire at Woodlawn Pharmacy 
early Saturday morning caused 
$40,000 worth of damage, accord
ing to Fred Mandler, of Bartlett 
Street, Squirrel Hill, owner of the 
drugstore.
The fire was discovered at 4:20 
a.m. by Robert Hoy, sophomore, 
industrial management, and his 
friend, Damiam Borod. According 
to the Security Department report, 
they were working on a car at the 
Margaret Morrison Avenue park
ing lot, when the burglar alarm 
went off at Woodlawn. Seeing 
that smoke was coming from the 
buildings ventilating system, they 
went to warn building residents.
They awoke Dean Earl Swank, 
Carnegie Tech dean of men, and 
Virginia Milligan, dean of 
women, who rent apartments in 
the building. Dean Swank notified 
the Security Office and with the 
aid of Hoy, Borod, and two sec
urity officers, evacuated the other 
apartments.
The Pittsburgh Fire Department 
arrived at 4:25 a.m. and fought 
the blaze until 6:30 a.m.
The Security Office estimates 
$10,000 worth of damage to the 
building, which is owned by Car
negie Tech. Most damage was 
done to the second floor front 
apartment rented by Dean Swank. 
The fire department had to break 
through the floor to extinguish the 
fire in the drugstore below.
The other nine apartments suf
fered smoke damage.
The fire was concentrated be
tween the walls and floors of the 
structure. According to the Secur
ity Affce, the fire started near the 
lunch counter in the drug store.
The origin of the fire is yet un
known, Carnegie Tech Security 
Chief Dwayne Young and the 
Pittsburgh Bomb and Arson Squad 
are conducting investigationis,
Mandler, Woodlawn Phar
macy owner, stated, Well have 
the drug store open at fast as we 
can. Some estimated that it will 
be re-opened in two months.
Thistle' Seeks Pictures
Of Campus Honoraries
by Eiissa Parker
The Thistle announced today that the 1964-65 yearbook 
will incorporate a new activities policy.
Group pictures will be taken of the members of each 
campus honorory. The Thistle staff believes that the honorar
ies are integral and active features of this campus, worthy 
of full representation. It expects these students to value their 
membership enough to record it in the school yearbook.

Tartan Bill Paid
A printing bill submitted on 
November 4 to Allan Pollock, 
president of Mens Dormitory 
Council, was returned last Satur
day evening to the Tartan office 
with a cash payment of $18.00.
Accompanying the payment was 
a brief explanatory statement ad
dressed to the business manager 
of the Tartan. It was signed by 
Pollock.
Pollock had been accused by the 
major staff editors of initiating 
printing changes in the October 28 
issue of the Tartan without au
thorization from the staff.
itors, conventional poses are be
ing avoided, replaced by creative 
and unusual shots of these groups.
Men are asked to wear coats 
and ties.
Any activity on campus want
ing to be represented in the Thistle 
should contact Pete Salkas, Or
ganization Editor, 561-5171, to 
arrange for a picture.
The Thistle also announced that 
students can now sign up for 
senior, sorority, and fraternity 
pictures in Room 46, Skibo. The 
photographer will be there for a 
limited time. Students are asked 
to make their appointments imbe contacted personally by Cam 
pus Chest solicitors.
The drive has been conducted 
on campus every year since 1949. 
when it was decided that appeals 
to the student body for contribu
tions to charities should be made 
only once yearly.
Last years drive was probably 
the most successful in the history 
of Campus Chest. Although more 
had been collected in earlier 
drives, the 1963 drive re-estab
lished the performance of Car
negie Techs Campus Chest, which 
has been doubtful during the un
successful drives of 1960-62.
From 1955-59, the collections 
amounted to over $2,000 yearly. 
These drives represented an over
all average of more than one dol
lar per person. Actually, partici
pation was usually no higher than 
60% with contributions averag
ing close to two dollars.
Collections reached $3,000 in 
1957, and the drive was pro
claimed the most successful of its 
kind by the National Student As
sociation.
The 1964 Campus Chest drive 
is expected to be as successful 
as any drive in past years. Special 
efforts will be made to reach all 
commuters, because as a whole, 
commuters have seldom had more 
than 25% participation.
After this years collections 
have been totaled, a list showing 
total contributions and participa
tion for Mens Dorms, Womens 
Dorm, Commuters, Graduate Stu
dents, and each fraternity will be 
printed in the Tartan.
Y ntema Calls For 6 Frontiers
by Carol S. Guber
Theodore O. Yntema delivered 
the last of three Benjamin F. 
Fairless Memorial Lectures at 
Carnegie Tech, Thursday.
In his lecture he summarized 
the frontiers of education" that 
invite exploration, He advo
cated the establishment of several 
major institutes of learning and 
teaching.
Yntema outlined six frontiers 
of education that need more con
sideration  research, specialized 
education, learning theory, edu
cation in pre-school years, im
proving productivity in education, 
financing education, and general 
education.
He said that the main objective 
of general education should be 
twofold . to
I develop quality and abilities that 
I will enable him to continue to 
I grow.
Yntema remarked that there is 
i increasing awarneness of this im~ 
i portance of education in early 
j years of life, and that recent data 
! suggests that the level of intellii gence and other abilities are in 
I major part determined before we 
| get to school."
He remarked that, at the college 
and graduate levels, tuition should 
be high enough to cover most of 
the costs, scholarships be provided 
for the most needy, and loans be 
available to all whose resources 
are inadequate,
Yntema also advocated (rfrect 
government subsidies to Individual 
students, allowing for a greater 
freedom of choice as to institution,

Congress Approves Proposal 
To Extend Library Honrs
by Candy Etkin and Liz Seley
Student Congress approved a proposal to extend library 
hours in a meeting held last Wednesday.
According to Joe Sandulli, chairman of Student Congress, 
the support Shown by the stu-' 
dent body for the proposal will aid 
Dean Brown in his attempt to ob
tain the approval of Kenneth 
Fagerhaugh, head of the Hunt 
Library.
If an agreement is reached, a 
one semester trial period will be 
put into affect. This will allow 
students to use the library facili
ties until 12 midnight Monday 
through Friday. Arrangements 
will be made so that women stu 
dents will also benefit from this 
extension of hours.
Congress also passed a motion 
to make Intermural Night an all 
school event. This is an annual 
activity, which will take place on 
March 19, from 6 to 10 p.m. It 
will consist of two championship 
basketball games, half-time en
tertainment, and the awarding of 
athletic trophies.
Because it is now an all school 
event, no other social functions 
will be planned for that evening.
The changing of eligibility re
quirements for candidacy for 
chairman of Student Congress 
was discussed, but no action was 
taken.
Bob Fritz, chairman of the Ac
tivities Committee, told Congress 
members that a humor magazine 
could be published if sufficient 
copy, photographs, and funds 
were provided.
The General Campus Committee 
will meet with Dean Brown in 
early December to discuss the 
possibility of changing the Car
negie Tech calendar.

Editorial
Pass This Bill
The student Library Committee submitted a bill last 
Wednesday to Student Congress outlining what we feel is 
an ample request for longer hours in the Hunt Library. It 
was passed unanimously.
The bill, now in the hands of Edward R. Schaltz, VicePresident in charge of Academic Affairs, needs administrative 
approval before funds can be allocated to bring the new 
schedule into effect.
As passed by Student Congress, the bill specifically calls 
for week-day (Monday to Friday) hours in the library to be 
extended to midnight for a one-semester trial period. (Week
end hours will remain unchanged.)
The recommendation, in part, said: The desire for 
longer hours arises from a need for greater access to reference 
materials available for use only in the library . . . The com
mittee . . . believes that there is sufficient need at present.
The measure constitutes a step in the proper direction, 
despite the fact that the Tartan had urged a provision to have 
the library open at 7:30 a.m. (favoring those Morewood wom
en with 10 and 11 p.m. curfews).
As the Tartan pointed out in the editorial of September 
23. the library of any college serves as the central core of 
that institution. Extended schedules in a library should be a 
prime concern of the college, so that the major part of a 
students education  book learning  can be served.
The ideal situation at any college, of course, is to have all 
facilities available 24 hours each day, but today this need is 
neither requisite nor economically feasible. The proposal of
fered by Student Congress, however, calls only for an addi
tional 10 hours to the present 84-hour per week schedule. This 
addition, alone, is enough at this time to satisfy the growing 
need for library facilities.
Of 821 students who responded to a campus poll in 1963 
sponsored by the Tartan, 670 favored the suggestion that the 
library open earlier on week-days and remain open later on 
Sundays. The latter has been enacted with a great deal of 
student enthusiasm; the former may be considered later if 
the present proposal gets administrative approval.
Creative effort suffers under limitation, and creative ef
fort is not confined to the Fine Arts building. Many students 
are comfortable in knowing that they have a place to study 
when they need it, and they differ greatly in their approach 
to out-of-class work. When they are able to choose both time 
and areas of study, they gain confidence in their work. A 
limiting library schedule, based only on finance and operative 
personnel, is certainly unfair.
For this reason, we suggest that the administration con
sider how the proposed schedule will contribute to the eleva
tion of academic initiative on campus. This, because it can
not be measured in dollars and cents, should not be consider
ed in equal terms.
The Tartan wholeheartedly supports the measure passed 
last Wednesday by Student Congress. We urge that the ad
ministration give it swift and unreserved approval.

Fraternities Re-Channel 
Creativity And Vitality
Editor, the Tartan
After reading the vital com
mentaries on the Greek way of 
life, I still found myself wonder
ing what the true function of the 
frats on campus is. I was inter
ested to see in your last editorial 
that one major problem on our 
campuses is that there is too much 
studying and notenough good 
citizenry in our student bodies.
In comparing the American 
student with the student of any 
foreign country, I think you will 
find him sadly lacking in either 
realm. The latter, reading the 
Tartan, would be positive that 
either the Greeks was a meta
physical goal or a political ques
tion of national import (or that 
you are slightly batty).
At present, by the worlds 
standards, the student of America 
parallels the introverted adoles
cent. He would dearly love to 
enter into a meaningful mature 
sexual relationship, but, quivering 
with joy at the thought, he quiet
ly locks his door and returns to a 
cheap imitation of life.
Rather than enter into the 
world as it presently exists, he is 
fighting for the oportunity to 
waste time (and money) on quib
bling over who will be the punch 
and cookies representative, and 
who will be the assistant to the 
chairman of the committee of 
grass cutting. Is this supposed to 
give him the training he needs to 
become a politically involved ma
ture adult? Is this where he finds 
his excellent training for the mind 
and good citizenship?
Until one of the typically ad 
hominem replies to your paper 
(or action) satisfactorily an
swers my question, I must view 
the true function of the frater
nities on campus as to rechannel 
any creativity or vitality you 
might have into an avoidance 
of maturity.
In both Europe and Asia, the 
student bodies are felt by the pol 
itician as the primary political 
pressure group. Our student bodies 
get (and indeed, deserve) no such 
respect.

Politics
GOP Must Find 
New Leader
by James Panepinto
With the crushing defeat of 
the Republican party in this 
years election, a reappraisal 
of the partys philosophy has 
been called for by many lead
ing Republicans.
The cries for a return to mod
eration and middle of the road 
policies are the methods by which 
these men hope to regain con
trol of the party mechanism.
Barry Goldwaters chances of 
retaining control of the Republi
can party are seen as very small, 
even by most of his supporters. 
Senator Goldwater commented 
that he wishes to help strengthen 
the Republican party, but as of 
now, I would think they propably 
would pick another man to run, 
and as of now that would be fine 
with me. This leaves the fight 
for the control of the party wide 
open.
Rich a r d Nixon and Nelson 
Rockefeller were two of the first 
Republicans to make statements 
after the election. Nixon began 
his effort to eliminate competi
tion for the 1968 GOP nomina
tion by criticizing Rockefellers 
lack of support for Barry Gold
water.
Nixons method here is a 
deliberate attack mechanism.

Mr. Nixon has a definite advan

has been out of the political scene

and his opportunities for making

If Kenneth Keating, defeated

would have been extremely good. 
His refusal to support Goldwater, 
his liberal philosophy, and his

made him a prime contender  
if he had been elected.
Charles Percy, defeated by a 
small margin in the Illinois gub

He seems to lack the dynamic

Governor Romney has the mod

STEP FORWARD 
WITH FORD MOTOR COMPANY
An Open Letter to the 1965 
College Graduate 
from Donald N. Frey, 
Assistant General Manager, 
Ford Division of 
Ford Motor Company
Donald N. Frey was awarded a bachelors degree in metal
lurgical engineering by the University of Michigan in 1947 
and a doctorate in 1950. One year later, he joined Ford 
Motor Company as manager of the Metallurgical Depart
ment in the Scientific Laboratory. In 1962, Dr. Frey was 
appointed assistant general manager of the Ford Division 
with responsibility for all engineering, product planning 
and purchasing activities. He is 41 years old.
Americas automobile industry is in the midst of a challenging era, with pros
pects of an even more exciting and demanding tempo in the years to come. 
Ford Motor Company is determined to achieve leadership in all phases of its 
operation. This leadership promises to bring lasting success to the company, its 
employes and its stockholders.
It will take people to accomplish this objective. Engineering, finance, styling, 
marketing, product planning, salesall require people with the knowledge, 
judgment and personal drive to avail themselves of the unprecedented oppor
tunities offered by a great industry.
The automobile business is growing. More cars are being bought now than ever 
before. With increases in population and consumer buying power, even more 
will be bought in the future. Realizing this, Ford Motor Company seeks to 
attract college graduates who have the capacity to grow with the company 
and the market.
Right now, our plans call for employing about a thousand of the best 1965 
graduates we can find, with all types of educational backgrounds. We need 
specialists, but we also need persons with broad liberal-arts training who can 
handle a wide variety of assignments. Actually, in our company, many gradu
ates grow into jobs totally unrelated to their degrees. They have discovered 
that Ford offers intellectually challenging opportunities for those with the 
ability to seize them. We invite you to make the same discovery.
Contact your Placement Office and arrange to see our representative.

W&J Overtakes Tartans, 21-6; Scores 3 TDs in Last Quarter
by Tom Terpack
W&Js Presidents scored two touchdowns within one 
minute and fourteen seconds early in the fourth quarter last 
Saturday to wipe out an early Tech lead, and went on to 
hand Tech its eighth defeat of the* 
season against one win.
A large contingent of Tech 
ans turned up at W&Js stadium 
on a beautiful football afternoon,
but the day belonged to the Prexies. The game began with Tech 
showing little respect for W&Js 
four game winning streak. Tech 
received the kick-off, but could 
not move, and punted to W&J.
Carl Rock. W&J quarterback 
then heaved a fony yard pass 
complete on Techs twenty yard 
line. Gentile then drove to the 
fifteen, but on the next play, a 
savage tackle bolted the ball out 
of Roy McClure's arms and into 
the waiting hands of end Dave 
DAppolonia, who scooted 
eighty-five wards for a Carnegie 
touchdown. Wisniewskis kick 
was blocked, and with four min
utes gone. Tech led, 6-0.
W&J took Techs kick-off. and 
in two plays, could move the ball 
only one yard. Rock again went 
back to pass, but the aerial was 
intercepted by Techs Jim Huckle
berry, only to be nullified by a 
fifteen yard penalty against Tech. 
Two plays later, however, Gen
tile fumbled and Huckleberry re
covered on the Tech forty-eight 
yard line.
For the next fifteen minutes, 
neither team could move the ball, 
with CIT and W&J exchanging 
six punts. W&J then drove down 
to the Tech twenty-two yard line, 
with a fourth down and one yard 
to go. A good rush by Jack Love 
and Dave DAppolonia dropped 
Rock on the twenty-five, however, 
and Tech took over the ball. Tech 
was able to move only to the 
forty-five, and Pete Ostling was

drove to the twenty-two, but a 
Wisniewski pass went astray and 
was intercepted and run back to 
the twenty-one. Keeping in the 
spirit of things, Techs Dave D
Appolonia snagged another Rock 
pass and moved to the W&J 
thirty-six.
With only seconds remaining, 
Wisniewski tried a field goal 
from the thirty-seven. The boot 
was short, and Tech went into

with a 6-0 lead.

forty-two, but a Tech fumble gave

SAE Is Co-Rec 
V-Ball Winner
SAE found the road a little 
rocky, but finally put down a de
termined challenge by ATO to 
capture first place in the co-rec 
volleyball playoffs.
SAE held on to win the first 
game 15-11, only to see the Taus 
open a 7-1 margin in the sec
ond contest. However, the hard 
driving spikes of Harvey Gam
mon turned the tide for SAE as 
they went on to claim a 15-10 
decision.
ATO and TDP battled each 
other on even terms through the 
first two games of the semi-finals, 
but ATO really turned on the 
firepower in the deciding con
test to win 15-6. SAE, mean
while, had a relatively easy time 
in disposing of GSIA in two 
straight sets.
The eonsolation encounter, be
tween TDP and GSIA, saw TDP 
put on a rallying finish to win 
the third and deciding match 16- 
14, and send GSIA down to their 
second straight defeat.

Rifle Team 
Defeated 
By WVU
by Scott McCormick
Paced by their two all-Ameri
cans, Bill Bohrman and John 
Writer, West Virginia University 
lived up to its rating as the na
tions best collegiate rifle team by 
easily defeating Carnegie Tech 
1452 to 1394. West Virginias 
score was typical, with their best 
five shooters averaging over 290 
out of a possible 300.
Had W.V.U. been able to count 
the scores of several freshmen 
who shot for them, they would 
have finished with a 1462, only 
a few points below the national 
intercollegiate record. Freshman 
arent eligible for W.V.U.s var
sity teams.
Freshmen are allowed to com
pete for the Tartans though, and 
its a good thing. Three out of 
the five shooters that placed for 
Carnegie were freshmen. High 
man was Freshman Dan West
lake, who had a fine 96 prone, 
93 kneeling, and 91 standing for 
a total of 280.
Second man for the Tartans 
was Scott McCormick who also 
straight match. When Bobby and 
finished 280 with scoies of 99- 
97-84. In case of ties in a rifle 
match, individual places are de
cided by who shot best in the 
standing position.
Tim Bristol and Ted Mankovich, two freshmen, and Rich 
Damberg rounded out the Tar
tan scoring with three 278s. Two 
veterans, Bob Fritz and Woody 
Whitlatch both tightened up in 
the standing position after fine 
prone and kneeling scores and 
failed to place for the second 
Woody begin to hit their stride, 
Tech should have one of the top 
teams in Western Pennsylvania.
Allegheny and Indiana State 
both sport averages over 1400 
while Carnegie has averaged 1389 
in two matches. Carnegie Tech is 
improving fast and both these 
teams may be in for a surprise 
when they fire against the Tar
tans. But they will only be sur
prised if veterans Fritz, Whit
latch, Damberg, McCormick, and 
Mersel can start pushing their 
scores over the 280 mark.
