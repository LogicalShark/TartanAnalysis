not bo composed of artists as it 
'has been in previous years, but will 
be made up of musoum art depart
ment heads.
Just recontly Mr. Saint-Gaudens 
was decorated an officer of the 
Legion of Honor of France in rec
ognition of services rendered in the 
exhibition of Manit paintings re

beld in 1932, was to celebrate the 
centenary of the birth of the 
French artist Manet, and, as most 
of his paintings were owned by 
Americans, the French government 
asked Mr. Saint-Gaudens to per
suade tty g owners to. lend, them for 
exhibition. Mr. Saint-Gaudens was 
decorated chevalier of the Legion 
of Honor in 1927. The decoration

Who hasnt anticipated the open
ing of archery season? Its such a 
long time since we have seen, any
one down in the valley flirting with 
the bulls eye that we were afraid 
the cold weather had killed off all 
the matadors. But the season is 
to open this week, Beth Lowerey 
announces. And. we are all set to 
perch on the top of the hill and 
watch the show. The season will 
continue throughout May and will 
be followed by the usual tourna
ment in which all th girls com
pete. The recently acquired set of 
new bows and targets ought to 
prove a big incentive for all the 
archers. Beth Lowrey will give 
instructions to all who wish to at
tend the instruction classes, so 
dont let the excuse of not being a 
perfect scorer prevent you from 
coming out for the whole season. 
Those who placed high in the fall 
tournament must continue to prac
tice this spring, also, in order to re
ceive full points.
Sylvia Waide has tried to sched
ule the coming Volleyball tournaments so that they will be con

there are over nineteen Sopho

allow two. teams from that class to 
compete against each other for theclass finals. Tuesday, the Fresh
men will play a combined team of 
Juniors and Seniors at 12:30. The 
two Sophomore teams will play on 
Wednesday at 12:30 and the win

It seems as if even Mr. Harpster 
can make a mistake, for there are 
lew who will argue that he didn't 
more than overmatch his boys last 
Saturday when he let them take on 
a nondescript bunch of has-beens 
from our fair institution. Not only 
did the old boys seem able to 
match Captain Stewart and his 
boys in endurance, but they far 
outclassed our regulars when it 
came to football.
When the game started, the vets 
got the jump on their former mates 
from the outset, but Mr. Iiannum 
stilled all comment by saying, 
lightly, Must wait until they have 
. bden playing for ten minutes; 
theyll be ieady for the showers." 
As the game wore on, however, 
and the varsity got no better with 
alacrity, Mr. 11 annum lost a great 
deal of his previous confidence and 
viewed the game with a solemn 
pan.
It was left for Mr. William 
Egbert ("I-Iooks" to most citizens) 
Sample to provide the real thrill of 
the morning when he decided the 
game in the closing moments by 
booting a new 30-yard placement to 
put the contest on the proverbial 
ice, 3-0. This is quite a remarka
ble feat for Mr. Sample when one 
considers that he played here for 
three years and never showed re
markable propensities for booting 
even points after touchdown, let 
alone 30-yard placements.
It was common knowledge down 
in the field house that the varsity 
was out to get a certain Mr. Joe 
Morbito, who gaiiied some promi
nence as a fullback a few years 
back. Mr. Morbito ignored such 
threats and proceeded to handle 
his alma maters prides and hopes 
as no true gentleman would. Kavel 
and Armentrout, two former cap
tains who are hoping for the de
pression to run its course, were 
also very much in the game. Mr. 
Kavel nabbed a couple of passes 
that brought, a gray hair or two to 
the lieuds of the youthful Tartan 
mentors, and Mr. Armentrout 
threw the varsity backs very 
roughly to the ground on what few 
occasions they managed to pene
trate the old fellows first line of 
defense.
In first downs, the alumni outscored the varsity six to one. Mr. 
Harpster tried very hard to sup
press details of the encounter, but 
it is understood that the Pittsburgh 
pressmen were in no mood to ac
cept bribes.
THE TARTAN TRACKERS avenged the basketball defeat rcceivcd 
at the hands of Western Reserve by nosing out the Red Cat runners 
84-59 in the Tartan Bowl last Saturday afternoon. The visitors came 
here with the idea of gaining a victory; In fact so confident were they 
that they had the results of each race wired to Cleveland Immediate
ly after the event was over. However, the Plaid squad was a little 
too well balanced for the visitorshence the outcome.
Without a doubt it wan one of the most interesting meets seen
in the Bowl in years. Although the Sklbos scored eleven first places,
each race was closely contested making the events Interesting and 
exciting.
Captain Coulter was high scorer of the meet. The big Tartan 
senior won 220-yard dash, the 120-yard low hurdles, and finished sec
ond in the 100-yard dash. He also ran a lap in the mile relay, mak
ing his total for the afternoon 14% points.
Schell, Burke, and Giolma each put on races that were beautiful 
to watch. Schell after trailing his opponent for four and a half laps
in the mile run, put on a burst of speed In the last half of a lap
which gave him a victory in the race by over ten yards. Bobby hails 
from Cleveland, and was a former Reserve student; so there is noth
ing he would rather do than defeat his home town folks.
Roger Burke, a sophomore, got away to a good lead in the 880- 
yard run and was never closcly pressed after that. Despite the fact 
that he wasnt pressed he completed his race In two minutes and 
two seconds, almost equaling the school rccord which he set last 
year.
Giolma, another sophomore, outdistanced the field in the 440-yard 
dash to win by a good margin in the surprisingly fast time of 50.6 
seconds.
Tartans Present Strong 
Team for Sports
Inaugural Here 
i ------------------
The Carnegie golf team went off 
to a flying start Saturday by de
cisively defeating a strong Du(piesne team 4 to 2 in their opening 
match at the Pittsburgh Field Club. 
The boys took matters in their 
own hands right from the start and 
came through consistently in 
nearly every round to take the 
town boys without much trouble. 
Joel Haverstick, number one man, 
started strong beating Joe Totten, 
Duke star, in a nip and tuck battle 
to the tune of 2 and 1. Kay came 
through easily with the low score 
of the day to beat Daly 6 and 5. 
The Skibo lad turned in an 82 card 
for his win. Reese also won 
handily, having Walsh 4 down at 
the end of the sixteenth. Red 
Fergus lost to Francis Totten, the 
toughest man on the Duke team, 
being 4 down with 3 to go after an 
uphill battle for fifteen holes.
The Kay and Reese twosome 
came through strong in their dou
ble match to' take Walsli' and Daly 
in a fast round. Haverstick and 
Fergus lost their twosome to the 
Totten brothers after a hot contest 
with the Duquesne boys winning 
narrowly on the last hole to take 
the battle one up. The fine work 
of the Tartan boys in the double 
matches lends even more promise 
to the Carnegie hopes this season.
The strong start Saturday looks 
good for the Skibo golfers. With 
a consistent display of the great 
form they showed in their opening 
match the Tartan stickmen are due 
to clean up in the five remaining 
contests. The boys meet West 
Virginia Saturday and should come 
through against the golfers from 
Morgantown.__________________________.

THE WEST1NGIIOUSE HIGH SCHOOL RUNNERS proved a little 
too strong for the Plaid Plebes and succeeded in winning their meet 
with the frosh by a GG-44 score. Coffey and Woodell, both of Westinghouse, wore the high Bcorers with two firsts apiece. Charlie 
Spisak scored eight points for the PleheB. Coffey won the 100-yard 
dash and the 220 in fast time for a high school runner. He negotiated 
the century race in 10.4 seconds and the 220 in 23 seconds.

the air to take the broad jump. As 
usual, Carnegie was weak in the 
high jump although the boys who 
responded to last weeks call for 
jumpers have not yet had time to 
ieacli their true form.'
The Westinghouse track team 
defeated the Carnegie Plebes 68-41 
in a dual meet held along with the 
varsity affair. McMahon in the 
mile and Spisak, Murray and Corn
ing in the field events were out
standing for Carnegie.
The Carnegie trackers take their 
first jaunt of the season this Sat
urday when the team journies to 
Little Washington to engage the 
W. & J. Presidents in their annual 
dual meet. While  the Red and 
Black is not figured to furnish 
pinch opposition, Coach Henry al
ways manages to haveseveral per
formers of ability to keep the Tar
tans on the go. The contest should 
also serve to iron out some of the 
rough spots which still remain and 
which must be polished off before 
the Geneva meet.

CAPTAIN HART1G AND HIS RACQUETEERS with but one practice 
journeyed over to Duquesne last Wednesday and tied the Bluffites 4-4. 
Captain Hartig and Groves each won their singles matches and 
paired together to win their doubles match. The story was a little 
different on Friday, when the netmen met Grove City on the Tartan 
courts. The Grovers had a right good team and came away with a 
4-3 victory. Witnessed by quite a group of spectators Hartwig won 
his singles match with comparative ease. Maszcov also won in the 
singles and Hollingsworth and Krey annexed one of the doubles 
matches to make It three points for the Skibos.
MESSRS. FERGUS, KAY, HAVERSTICK, AND REESE engaged 
themselves in that noble Scotch pastime of golfing last Saturday 
morning for their Alma Mater and after much swinging, grass cut
ting, ditch digging, swearing and whatnot they emerged victorious 
over the Duquesne Dulces by a 4-2 score. This match marked the in
auguration of golf as a competitive sport at Carnegie. When we con
sider the fact that no one had had much chance to practice l^foro the 
match wo must hand the boys credit for their win. Haverstick, 
Roose, and Kay won. their matches while Gentleman Janies Fergus 
was not so fortunate and was defeated by F. Totten of the Dukes. 
The Skibo golfers are playing all of their matches at the Pittsburgh 
Field Club.
THE CARNEGIE TECH HAS-BEENS donned their football uniforms 
once figaln when they put them on for Just llbhg enough to give the 
varsity a practice game on Saturday morning. The Alumni gridders 
did inpt have enough men to make up a team so they had to borrow 
three players from the varsity squad, and with this makeshift outfit 
they gave the undergraduates quite a drubbing. The final score was 
3-0, but this does not Indicate the superiority of the Alumni toam.
On the squad were Hooks Sample, Kebe, Croissant, Tony Sweet, 
McCurdy, Morbito, Armentrout, and Kavel. Eleven men started the 
game and the same eleven finished It without having any substitu
tions made. The former stars finished the game but It almost fin
ished them. Burt Munhnll has taken on Bevcral assistants for the
next few dnya.
The Iron Men brought the ball Into scoring position several 
times but It wasnt until the last couple of minutes that they were 
able to score. Georgle Kavel made a shoestring catch of a pass on
the twenty-yard line to start things going. The ball was worked up
to the twelve-yard line but on third down they were thrown for a loss 
near the aide of the field. With the ball on the twenty-two-yard 
line Hooks Sample did what he had failed to do for four years of
playing: he calmly walked up to the ball and plaoe kicked It over the
crossbar for three point.
The entire team playod a good game. Jumping Joe Morbito, 
Kavel, and "Army" were demons at ball carrying and In backing up 
the line. Tony Sweet 1 a sweet end If you ask me. Croissant,
Kebe, and Hooks were continually in the varsity's backfleld sort of
mousing things up generally.

Mighty nice to be back once 
again in the old Union for a good 
old fashioned dance. One of those 
old time affairs which were so dear 
to the night students of a few 
years back when the hall was big 
enough to accommodate the attend
ance of the night groups. One 
sorta felt familiar with the sur
roundings and there was the 
atmosphere of friendliness which 
was ever present in good old 
Union. Of course, the occasion of 
the return to the Union was the 
Night College of Industries Dance 
and the innovation proved a tre
mendous success. Bet Mr. Manson was chuckling with glee when 
he saw all those young people 
trooping through the doors as they 
wended their way to the third floor 
of the Administration Building. 
Seemed like old times, call it 
repression, depression or what
ever kind of ession you 
have a mind to, all I can 
say is that the dance was a 
success and thanks should go to 
those who put it over. I was an 
outsider, but that didnt deter me 
from coming, especially so, since I 
have cultivated the art of making 
myself supple enough to slip past 
the guards at the door. Some day 
Ill let everybody in on the secret.
Suppose it is too soon to talk 
about the new timein case you 
dont know what the new time is 
well, Its the Daylight Saving Time 
At any event it will be strange 
for the next week or so to get up 
one hour earlier and go to work, 
and then find that when it comes 
time for school it will be daylight. 
Our night school will not then have 
the same significance. We will be 
able to get a real glimpse of our 
beautiful .campus. Maybe we can 
watch those yellar daisies push 
themselvs through the sod to the 
chagrin of Fritz, the Farmer. 
These flowers have a penchant for 
springing up most anywhere, some
thing like the quizes one gets o1 
and on throughout the year.
Well the 1933 Exhibition will be 
a t hing of history when this ramble 
-will Ve -fead, but the success of the 
display will be something el^e. 
Each year more people are attract
ed. to the annual affair until now, 
if^uiytliing were to happen that 
made it necessary to call the exhi
bition off, it would be a real calam
ity, and not even the retrenchment 
which one hears on all sides would 
justify such action. So we can feel 
that one thing is certain and that 
is that we will have exhibitions. 
Although some of us were mighty 
tired after trudging through the 
different buildings and viewing the 
various sights offered by all the 
departments, still we feel that It 
was a night svOuu spent and com
mence to make plans to be on hand 
next year for another show.
My hats off to the new Queen 
of the Night CampusBernice 
Perry. Sure was glad to see such 
Interest shown in the selection of a 
reigning beautywho could gain
say she is not. Just look at her

last issue of the Tartan. Why I'd 
vote for her myself, not that I had 
a vote, but that wouldnt matter, 
shes elected queen and congratu
lations are in orderso here they 
are, Miss Parry, may you live long

T see that We will have the sup
plementary term offered us again 
let me seefor the nth time, I 
can hardly think back how long it 
is since this unique program of 
studies was put into effect. So 
long ago, however, that its worth 
is beyond question. Just take a 
glance at the number of subjects 
which are offered and think how* 
your schedule next year will be 
lightened if you select one of the 
subjects and continue right along 
after the close of the regular night 
term. Registration for the courses 
offered will take place during this 
week I note, and in case there are 
any questions which one might 
wish answerd, these can be taken 
care of by calling at the Registrars 
Office. Better decide to take one 
of these courses and come right 
along in. the water's fine. If you 
dont it may be that you will have 
to wait two or three years before 
you will be able to take the sub
ject.
I wonder how the race of races 
is coming along. It would be in
teresting to watch those gladiators, 
or should I call them 'marathon

night as they come closer to their

Creek, Pine Hollow. Wind Gap 
Road, Beck's Run, McKeesport, or 
McKees Rocks either one will do 
since they belonq to McKee, not 
forgetting Saw Mill Run, will have 
claimants for the title. This race 
for night education has got me hot

who the winners will be. But 
something else is bothering me 
right now and that is that eternal

Application to 
Studies Shown 
By Final Exams
This edition of the niglit. school 
page is published in the middle of 
exam week. It will come forth at 
a time when the night student is 
under his or her greatest strain, 
and when the day of reckoning 
is close at hand.
To those students who have 
faithfully followed their studies 
and who look upon the examina
tions as complacently as one who 
knows can, little but words of 
commendation can be said.. They 
have worked hard, and are now 
soon to receive the satisfaction 
that only grades can give to an in
dustrious scholar.
To those who fell by the way
side, either through external influ
ences, carelessness, or too fast or 
too hard a schedule, condolences. 
All of us, at many times through
out our night school work, must 
suffer such heartbreaking disap
pointments. Many of us have had 
our quota of daily work in
creased due to layoffs of our 
fellow employes, others have 
suffered salary reduction, layoffs, 
and other ambition-wrecking set
backs. >But we mustfight to retain 
our clear visions of our respective 
goals in spite of, in the vernacular, 
hell and high water.
To those who were forced to 
drop their studies entirely for 
financial or other reasons, we can 
only extend our sympathies, and 
a hearty welcome back for the 
1933-34 term. Most of us have put 
too much into our efforts to ob
tain an education to surrender, 
without a stiff struggle, the ground, 
that we have gained at so much 
cost of time and effort. Come 
back, if at all possible, and finish 
your course. Youll never regret 
it.
And to all students, all the luck 
in the examinations yet to come, 
and may the grades received exeede your modest expectations.
Dorm Boat Ride 
This Fri. Night
Night students living in the 
dormitories have been asked to par
ticipate in the Annual Mens 
Dormitory Boat Ride, to 'be held 
May 5. The steamer S. S. Wash
ington has been chartered for the 
cruise and will leave the wharf at 
9 p. m. and return at 1 a. m. Danc
ing will commence at S:30 p. m. 
and continue until the boat docks 
upon its return.
Tickets for the dance may be 
procured from any member of the 
dorm committee, in the Grill, or at 
the Y office. The price is $1.00 
per couple.
DIDJA NOTICE
THAT this is hell-week, as 
far as the night school is con
cerned. anyway.
THAT it will soon be all 
over, and then a nice long sum
mer to sit back and contem
plate the joy of living . . . 
swimming . . . camp . . . va
cation trips . . . get all the
travel folders and see what you 
can enjoy for only a few dol
lars, then shut your eyes and 
cuss softly to yourself, because 
you can't do anything about It 
and will have to stay home this 
year. Ah! me. Wotta life.
THAT one big dance next 
week and then the end of a 
successful social season despite 
repression and whatnot.
THAT all night students can 
attend the Spring Carnival, pro

they going to do with her?
THAT some soulless person 
wants to know, why have a 
May Queen in April.
THAT some night students 
are going to use their sea legs 
and go on the dormitory boat 
ride this week. Better take 
your water wings along, folks.
THAT thats that and Ill be 
seenya.
Call for Frashman 
Track Men Issued
Any freshmen who are inter
ested in becoming members of 
the freshman track team should 
report to the field house at 
once. This is an excellent op
portunity for men to earn their 
numerals. Men able to compete 
in the field and weight evepts 
are especially urged to report.
There Is also an opening for 
several more freshman and 
sophomore managers.
Night School 
Travel Champ 
Is Crowned
Number of Entrants in 
Contest Less Than 
Last Years
The championship traveling con
test is over, and a king has been 
found. The second annual contest 
to find the champion long distance 
traveling night student, although 
not as successful as the first one, 
was nevertheless gratifying in the 
response that it produced.
The new king of travelers is 
Frank Cechvala, Jr., of Ford City, 
Pa. Mr. Cechvala travels SO miles 
per night to and from school. He 
attends classes five nights a week 
giving him a total of 400 miles of 
travel each week. Not being satis
fied with this, however, he also 
comes to school on Saturdays, Just 
in case someone might dispute his 
right to the crown. Congratula
tions, Mr. Cechvala. We salute 
you, and may success be yours. 
You are indeed worthy of the title, 
Champion Long Distance Traveling 
Night Student.
The runner-up in the contest is 
Lester Mohrbacher of New 
Brighton, Pa., who travels 70 miles 
each evening, four nights a week, 
giving him a total of 280 miles per 
week of traveling in his desire to 
gain an education. Fine work, Mr. 
Mohrbacher, may success crown 
your efforts.
Third place honors go to M. J. 
'Kellner, of New Stanton, Pa. Mr. 
Kellner comes to school three 
nights each week, and covers 74 
miles each night, giving him a to
tal of 222 miles per week.
These men, and the rest of those 
night students who commute, are 
to .be highly commended for the 
efforts they are making to obtain 
an education. Their sincerity is 
manifest, when one considers the 
sacrifices they are making so that 
they may be better fitted for the 
battle of life.
One noteworthy fact was brought 
out in this contest. The numbers 
of students from distant points lias 
been materially reduced from those 
of previous years. No doubt many 
former students would have liked 
to continue their educational pur
suits at Carnegie, but train 
fare and other incidental expenses 
over and above tuition fees were 
no doubt more than their already 
strained purses could stand. Bur., 
cheer up. Things look much bet
ter, and we are looking forward to 
another contest next year. Mean
while, all hail the new .champions.
Spring Brings Warning 
To Keep of the Grass
With the coming of Spring, 
green lawns, budding trees and 
washed windows make their ap
pearance on the campus. If we do 
say it ourselves, we are partakers 
of a very pretty campus. And, 
although it might seem superfluous 
to mention it here, we want to 
keep it that way. Grass, trees, and 
shrubs that have been placed to 
beautify the campus are not public 
property, and are not to be abused.
Any unnecessary use of the 
lawns as a pathway, or use^of trees 
and shrubbery as a source of tooth
picks and pipe-cleaners is not to bo 
condoned. Anyone who cares for 
his or her lawn at home knows 
how much irreparable damage can 
be done by thoughtless abuse that 
may require only a second to per
form. So be on your guard at all 
times, and prevent or abstain from 
destroying campus scenery.
Avoid walking on the grass, and 
be careful not to deposit waste. paper, etc., in the shrubbery. Ex
ternal appearances count for a 
great deal. Carnegie has a beauti
ful campus. Help to keep it so.
Student Finds 
New Us es for 
Evening Gun
The "evening gun sounded on 
Exhibition Night gives us an idoa. 
Why not develop a system where
by a cannon could be fired at 
crucial moments in campus life. A 
battery placed at Woodlawn avonue near the Shelter at the car 
stop could be fired just as the stu
dents svOYO boarding their cars, 
thereby distracting the motormans 
attention Troiii the pennies, beercliecks, lodge pins, etc., deposited 
as fare.
Other applications of the Idea 
would Include a saluto of the com
posite batteries in honor of the 
purposeful night student who is 
sorry that the term is nearly 
ended. Another possible applica
tion would be to train at least two 
guns of the Woodlawn battery up 
and down Forbes' street, so that 
the Inevitable stream of automo
biles that always manages to get 
betwoen us and the car that we 
wish to catch could be persuaded 
(?) to stop and lot us pass/
Accidental demolition ol! the yel
low horses, the Arts school and the 
Hut, due to thoughtloss loading 
with shell instead of wadding could 
be nicely cheekd off to profit and 
loss. Any injuries received by the 
Colleges of Industries or Engineer
ing would be too trivial to mention here. Margaret Morrison
would be neutral territory, insofar 
as the building would probably be 
the logical one to use for a mugu 
zlne.
Then, too, a good window rattling 
salute is due to I ho Administration 
that has stood by many of us dur
ing this depression.
Our platform: Wo want campus 
artillery.
To Hold Last 
Night School 
Dance May 13
Final Social Event of 
Season to Be Held 
In Mens Gym
May 13 is the day set for the In
ter-Night College dance, the last 
affair on the Night Student Coun
cil calendar. This dance will cli
max a highly successful social sea
son despite the drop in student 
registration and present businoss 
conditions.
The dance will be held in the 
mens gymnasium which will bo ap
propriately decorated for the occa
sion and will offer night students 
the last opportunity to meet their 
fellow students at a regular night 
school social function. Coming as 
it does one week after final examina
tions it will be a fiile chance to 
get together and discuss the 
answers to some of those perplex
ing problems that profs have a 
habit of thinking up.
Tickets have been sent to all 
night school salesmen and advance 
reports already indicate that many 
are planning to attend the affair.
As yet no orchestra has been se
cured for the party but several 
very good ones are under consider
ation. The social chairman hints 
that a brand new group of musi
cians that have never played on 
the campus before are to be im
ported for the affair. Announcemen.t of the selection will probably 
be made next week.
Be sure to get your ticket this
week from one of the salesmen as
there will bo no regular school
next week. The assessment, as
usual, Is one. dollar per. couple.
Spring Carnival 
Tickets on Sale

manifest in the night school as to 
possible participation in the cele
bration.
Events scheduled Include dancT 
lug each night, crowning of the 
May Queen, races of various kinds, 
and many other features climaxed 
with the production "Over the 
Coals." Night students are Invited

groatly onjoy thom.

Industries Hold 
Successful Dance
Another tradition was established 
recently by the Night College of 
Industries when the usual second 
semester smoker was called off and 
a dance was substituted in its 
stead.
The dance was an unusual suc
cess and many of the familiar 
faces which usually attend the In
dustries smoker wero seen at the 
party, this time accompanied by 
their friends, tripping along to the 
rhythmof a popular-tune. .
. Fred Ford and his Orchestra fur
nished the music for the affair and 
was well received. This is a new 
group of campus musicians, per
haps. playing for the first time for 
a college dance, and the reception 
accordedthem certainly indicates 
that they can play.
Refreshments were served be* 
tween the dances and proved very 
popular. As the time for terminat
ing the dance came near, regrets 
were expressed and it. is hoped 
that Industries will have more of 
these dances.
It is said that students at Am
herst have a pool on the number 
of the hymn to be announced in 
chapel.

A Need for Optimism
Oi: the 140,000 students graduating this June, not more 
than 15,000 will be successful in finding gainful employment, 
says a letter from the National Planning Committee lor Un
employed College Graduates. Lost ... 4 years . . . and 
$5,000; cries the headline of an article in the May issue of 
College Humor and Sense. From all sides we hear discussed 
the fate of the unemployed graduate. We learn that in New 
York alone there are over 13,000 unemployed engineers and it 
is estimated that there are 75.000 unemployed teachers in the 
country.
Seniors this year will enter a business world which is sick 
and inactive. Ahead of them have gone three graduating 
groups, approximately less than twenty per cent oil -which have 
secured positions. Yes, and many heads of familiesmany 
i fathers of men and women who. will, graduate in Juneare 
without work. In spite of all these factors, we do not think 
the plight oi: the college graduate a hopeless one.
Lately there have been some strong indictments made 
against a college education. Especially have these condemna
tions been directed toward the typical A. '13. courses, yet many 
question the value of all college courses. Henry Morton Rob
inson, in an article convicting his A.B. course for gross irrelativity, says that he , spent four years of his  believingest 
years and approximately .1>5,000 acquiring a stck of useless 
and unrelated information which he discarded as soon as lie 
stepped from the campus. Purging his readers further with 
lamentations and calling the modern curriculum makers 
waddling old penguins,M he likens the A. B. education to 
chunks ol! corn bee#an assortment oi: traditional, utatic, and 
unrelated facts which are salted down in the memory and 
pulled out oli their brine whenever and wherever an audience 
will, listen and then flopped (so he says) back in the tank. All 
well, and good, Mr. Robinson, but why do we attend college? 
Why dt> we spend our believingest years acquiring smatterings 
of knowledgeV What is our object in this world? Should we 
be discouraged about our future, Mr. Robinson?
: Confronted with the unavoidable facts ol' economic fatigue, 
the graduates face a tremendous problem. When positions do 
become available, they musi; compete with, men long experi
enced in business (there is much yet'to learn). They must nell 
themselves to the world, a world that is sick, Granted Iluil, 
a mans primo object in attending college is to equip himself 
to earn a living, what is he to do il! there is no position avail.able for him when he graduates? The best salesman cannot 
make a sale if there are no consumers; and likewise, the most 
successful students cannot find work when there are no serv
ices needed."
It is often said that we are learning to live while in col
lege. Perhaps the graduates will not be able to secure work, 
yet have they not developed a broader outlook on life and its j 
[problems and have they not obtained a vision and a foresight 
that they did not; possess be foro entering college? Some stu
dents have earned a goodly portion of their eollego expenses 
and this experience is itself a masterful teacher. While many 
have been financed by parents, who have sacrificed pleasure's 
and often necessities, they have been given the advantage of 
seeing the depression from the observation ear. Surely an ex
pensive investment this college education, but is the wealth of 
experience gained in college life, the life aside irom the class
room, to be gained elsewhere? We think not.
If the graduate has not gotten something of inestimable 
value for the price of $5,000 plus his believingest years, the 
years when he should be enjoying life and acquiring a founda
tion' for the future, then he has been asleep. If the A.B. course 
has not given its graduates something, regardless of its 
idealistic philosophy, it has been the fault of the graduates. 
Can we forget about securing work and look at a college edu
cation from the standpoint of a happy experience and a pro
gram of training not securable elsewhere? Our object should 
be to liveearning is but a part of living.
There is no reason to be discouraged about the future. 
The graduate this year will need confidence and courage, but 
lie should not lose sight of his objects in life. Sometimes it 
is well to be idealistic.

CONTRIB
To the Editor:
I heartily commend your editorial 
To War Against War. It would be 
a significant step towards world 
j)oace and international good will 
If Carnegie students Would join 
other collegiate groups in pledging 
themsolvoB to outlaw offensive 
warfare. Someone must, start the 
anti-war ball rolling and the logical 
candidate Is the Amorloau student, 
(ho citizen and leader of tomorrow.
Some courageous and broad
minded studonts have already 
signed a pledge not to bear avmo 
nnlosH the nation is invaded by a 
liostllo power. Theso men are not 
cowardlythey are ready to spring 
to the defense of America but they 
see little sense in carrying a chip 
on their shoulders looking for 
trouble.
The peace movement has its pur
pose, it has its leaders. What tills 
movement against offensive war
fare needs is the support of Ameri
can students. Many colleges have 
joined in the movement. What about 
Carnegie? Are we to take our 
place among the leaders of the 
student world or are we to be 
listed among the "also rans? 
Sincerely yours,
A STUDENT.
Katherine V. Wholey 
Elected Carnival Queen
ANnJTnBOd FYNm SaeO 1 
are honorary cadets in the Car
negie R, O. T. C.
The coronation of the new queen 
will take place at the Coronation 
ball, Thursday evening, May II, at 
10 oclock. The ceremony, accord
ing to Christine Leighou who is 
dlrootlng it, will be short, dignified, 
and simple, The costumes will bo 
strictly modern and In koeping 
with the event.
Although this is Carnegies thir
teenth Spring Carnival, Katherlno 
Wholey is but the twelfth Carnival 
Queen. Josephine Whitney, a Mar
garet Morrison Secretarial student 
was first queen in 1922, the third 
year of l.lve Carnival. She lnvs 
been succeeded by: Peg Harmon 
in 15)2:5; Josephine Gibson in 192-1; 
Mary Spoors in 1925; Tydfil Jonos 
iii lft2G: Emily Fulton in 1927; 
Betty McFadden in 192S; Henrietta 
Accipiter in 1929 (although there 
was no Carnival in 1929); Isabel 
Shepherd in 1930; Elizabeth Steele 
in 1931; and Mary Mclveon in 1932.
A Tartan of 1927 says: The cus
tom has now ripened into an estab
lished tradition here. The choice 
is commonly supposed by outsiders 
to be made purely from the stand
point of beauty, but although 
beauty undoubtedly still plays an 
important part, general popularity 
has come to occupy as conspicuous 
a place in the selection.
INTERCOLLEGIATE
CLIPS
Bing Crosbys newest theme 
song. "Youre Just a Beautiful 
Melody'of Love, was written for 
a co-ed at Western Maryland by a 
student at the University of Penn
sylvania.
A student at Haverford offers 
this definition of a kiss: "A kiss 
is a noun, though generally used 
as an interjection. It is never de
clined; it is more common than 
proper; usod in the plural and 
agrees with all genders.
THE CARNIVAL
The carnival show is rapidly rounding into 
Hbape and all indications point to. a production 
that will set the standard for future shows to 
shoot at. The times are plentiful and catching 
and the dancing as executed under the tutalege 
ol Bill Bales is on a par with any Broadway pro
duction. By the way, Bill does a solo dance that 
should make the local critics sit up and take no
tice. Nothing like it has ever been staged here 
before.
When tickets went on sale yesterday two 
members of the freshman class were still won
dering about dates. Jimmy Latta claims that he 
cant find a single willing co-ed, but Chuck 
, Ehriclc finds just the other trouble, one two few 
days for the number, of dates. Get together boys, 
get together.
Jts just about time that the boys started 
warming up for the big pushmohile sweepstakes. 
The cup presented to the winner of this event is 
one of those given for permanent possession for 
interfraternity competition. 
This year the closing exercises are planned for 
the stage of the Pitt Theater after the perform
ance of Over the Coals, which means that the 
freshman that is chosen to weld the link will 
play to the largest crowd in a decade.*****
HERE AND THERE
Marjorie Stout and Alice Work are seen hold
ing long and earnest talkfests in the Hut these 
days. It seems that Peggy Seibert and some
body or other Sinitk are also involved. Well 
keep it dark.
Several weeks back Bill Garrity received a let
ter and because of his'continued surprise at its 
having escaped mention thus far here goes. It is 
headed Dear Miss Garrity and is sprinkled with 
phrases such as the following: If you really
want to double your beauty," Now look in your 
mirror at your eyes. It all winds up with the 
following sentence, Wont you tell me of your 
hucccss? Better let him know, Bill.
A number of our more graceful co-eds were 
members of the ballet at the opera last Thursday 
and Friday. Ask them about the write-up the 
morning after the opening performance.*****
EXHIBITION NIGHT
It really began about ten-thirty last Friday 
morning when the aerios borrowed autogyro 
landed on .the, cut and decreased the attendance 
at classes, .about .fifty per cent. But it didnt real
ly get started until Bobby Smith and Pal Miller 
started escorting groups of high school children 
about the campus. Needless to say, flocks of the 
weaker sex were close on the heels of the guides.
In the evening, fond parents gathered to ob
serve just what the sons and daughters of Car
negie do in all the big white buildings. Every
thing, was there to be seen and heard, from the 
faint erackel of a cosmic ray to the masonry de
partments house. As is always the case, several 
amusing incidents are bound to come up in con
junction with an exhibition and this was no ex
ception. The one that probably gathered more 
gasps than any of the others took place at the 
fashion show in the afternoon. Ellen Bishop 
was responsible for it when she caught her heel 
in an extra muslin skirt she was wearing. The 
resulting ripping sound caused all within hear
ing to ahlih in anticipation, but everything turn
ed out all right.*****
HEARD AND SEEN
A high school lad. apprehending a class hon
orary dink wearer, Oh, look at the fresliie. 
Fritz quite vexed at the Roticy boys prancing 
on his grass on the Cut. Derby-decked and 
cigar-ladened, he seemed quite concerned.
We cant pass the one about Cliff Boutelle. 
It seems that for three days he has been water
ing the grass in the back yard of the Pi K. A. 
house, and after bragging about how nice the 
grass will be when it sprouts forth, imagine 
his embarrassment when he was informed that 
no grass seed had been planted.
Parthenon Model 
Now on Display
The recently unveiled miniature 
model of the Parthenon in Athens 
is now on exhibition in the Hall of 
Architecture at Carnegie Institute. 
The model, constructed by Laurance. W. Hitt, architect, assisted 
by Ross Polis, caretaker of casts 
in the Department of Fine Arts, 
was under construction during the 
past year.
This replica of one of the most 
beautiful buildings of ancient 
Greek architecture shows the build
ing as it appeared about twentythree hundred years ago. The 
model, erected as an exact copy of 
the original Parthenon, takes into 
account all of the refinements of 
the original. It has been erected' 
with the eastern doorway open and 
inside a .statue of Pallas Athena, 
is seen at the far end of the hall. 
It is built on a scale of 1/20 of the1 
Parthenon and is constructed en
tirely of plaster of paris. Sur
rounding the top of the model there 
are about 800 sculptured figures, 
each worked out in plastic material 
before it was cast.
The model is to stand in the cen
ter of the hall of architecture at 
Carnegie Institute and will be on 
exhibition each week day from 10 
a. m. to 10 p. m. and on Sundays 
from 2 to 6 p. m.
Contest Offers 
Students Free 
Trip to Europe
A summer in Europe with aU ex
penses paid is offered to the col
lege man and woman who presents 
the best plan for the organization 
of unemployed graduates for con
structive public service. A nation
al survey indicates that only one 
in eight members of the class of 
1933 will be able to obtain selfsupporting jobs.
The two winners of the national 
contest will be sent to Europe this 
summer to live in Swiss, Austrian, 
Dutch or Welsh student .camps for 
six weeks; to travel to European 
capitals; to be entertained by stu
dent and public leaders. This Is 
an excellent opportunity to study 
Europes answer to the problem of 
unemployed youth.
The nine rules pertaining to the 
contest may be read on any of the 
college bulletin boards. The con
test will end June 1, 1933. All par
ticipants will address their essays 
to the National Planning Commit
tee for Unemployed College Grad
uates, 450 Seventh Avenue, New 
York City. This competition is 
sponsored by National Student 
Federation of America, Internation

GENERAL ELECTION RESULTS

one out of eleven college engage

think that percentage is a little 
too high for the average campus.

Carnegie Honoraries
The Carnegie Alpha Chapter of 
Alpha Tau, national scholastic fra

founded in 1916 to afford a means 
of honoring those students in the 
College of Industries who have 
high scholastic records.
Since several of the courses from 
Avhich Alpha Tau has chosen its 
members in the past haAre been 
transferred to the College of En
gineering, the present members of 
Alpha Tau have petitioned Phi 
Kappa Phi, a national co-educational scholastic honorary, to be alloAVed to form a chapter of that fra
ternity at Carnegie. If a chapter Is 
formed It Avill be an all-campus so
ciety for honoring students with 
high scholaship ratings.
Of the students In the College 
of Industries, the highest sopho
more and a small percentage of the 
highest juniors and seniors, are eli

The Teatro Dei Piccoli
From Rome
Nixon Theater, Week of May 1
It is a good principle to have 
respect for whatever has persisted 
for ages as an expression of hu
man nature. Therefore, the ar
rival of the Teatro dei Piccoli 
of Rome should not be disposed of 
lightly as a marionette sIioav for 
children" because the marionette 
or puppet has a history extending 
back to the earliest manifestations 
of mans interest In the theater. 
With the Japanese, shadoAV-puppets 
arose in religious Avorsliip, just as 
did the drama Avith the peoples of 
the Avestern world; in Japan, the 
Doll Theater, a development of 
puppetry through early centuries, 
became in the seventeenth century 
so important that the greatest 
playwrights and the most capable 
technicians were associated Avitli 
It. It is from this Doll Theater, 
for Instance, that the revolving 
stage, Avhich is still a luxurious 
novelty Avith us, Avas derived. Noi
ls It too much to say that avo do 
not understand the art of the thea
ter of the East, because avo are not 
familiar .with the art of the 
marionette Avhich profoundly in
fluenced the Oriental theater of 
flesh and blood. From Greece and 
Rome puppetry descended through 
the Middle Ages, engaging even in 
the presentation of the mysteries 
and the moralities. When the 
Elizabethan theater flourished, the 
marionette had his oavh plays, 
Avliicli were called motions." and 
it is interesting to note Shakes
peares reference to one about the 
Prodigal Son. Indeed, Shakespeare 
gave to the delightful playgoer at 
the Piccoli exactly the line to 
accompany applause: O excellent 
motion! O exceeding puppet!
One of the first of the moderns 
to recover consideration for the 
artistic significance .of the marion
ette Avas the Belgian dramatist, 
Maeterlinck, Avho dedicated his 
early plays, including Pel leas and 
Melisande, to the theater or ma
rionettes. His theory had great 
influence, and led to the kind of 
scrutiny to which Gordon Craig 
later subjected dramatic art, glori
fying the puppet and editing a 
magazine to revive interest in an 
ancient art and to emphasize Avhat 
he meant by the marionette quality 
in a dramatic presentation. Inas
much! as five marionette troupes
Avere bidding for patronage during 
the Christmas holidays in New 
York, the manikin actor seems to 
have made the most of all  this 
encouragement, in spite of the 
hard times faced by his betters.
But the Teatro dei Piccoli is 
the marionette theater in siich 
command of a richly varied reper
tory, technical skill, and expres
siveness in facial modeling and 
costuming that the fame of this 
Roman theater is easily under
stood. In fact, Maeterlinck and 
Craig seem much less extravagant 
in replacing mobile man by immo
bile puppet. Vittorio Podrecca, the 
puppeteer, is apparently a supreme 
master, and he is besides as amus
ing in introducing his flesliless 
company as he is satirical in show
ing up, through his animated dolls, 
human foibles that leave us less 
egotistic.
Here is grand .entertainment for 
adults and enchantment for the 
young. Just overcome that skepti
cism and go; Signor Podrecca Avill 
not disappoint you.

Yale, Harvard and Princeton. The coat is a trifle 
longer  in two - button, three-button and ffca 
double-breasted....................................................
