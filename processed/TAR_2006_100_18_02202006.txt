Zeta becomes 
Alpha Chi 
Omega
The only local sorority, 
Zeta joins national 
organization
by Nicole Barley
Staffwriter
Add another item to the list of 
changes taking place on Carnegie Mellons campus this year: Local sorority 
Zeta Psi Sigma is no longer. The letters 
adorning the house have been removed 
and are soon to be replaced by three 
new ones: AXQ.
Justin Brown/Assistant Photo Editor
On February 1, Zeta Psi Sigma offi
cially asked national sorority Alpha Chi 
Omega to become part of the Greekcommunity on Carnegie Mellons campus. 
After 12 years 'as part of the University, 
the local sorority has been adopted 
by a national organization. Following 
much deliberation on behalf of the 28 
sisters of Zeta Psi Sigma, the women 
of Carnegie Mellons Panhellenic Coun
cil, the dean of Student Affairs, and the 
coordinators of Greek Affairs, Alpha 
Chi Omega was chosen as the best fit.
Previously known as Chi Omega, 
Zeta Psi Sigma was formed when Chi 
Omegas national charter was revoked 
for financial reasons in 1992. This 
marks the second change in affiliation 
during the sisterhoods history.
It was a hard decision. A lot of the 
sisters didnt want to give up Zeta. But 
we knew if we didnt do it now, Zeta 
would die, said former Zeta Psi Sigma 
president Jamie Moroco, now president 
of Alpha Chi Omega.
You want something to come back to 
in five years, Moroco said, noting that 
the choice to be adopted by a national 
sorority was a long time in coming.
It was hard to hang with the other 
nationals here without the support of a 
national organization, she added.
Emerging empty-handed from this 
falls Formal Membership Recruit
ment session, Zeta welcomed four new 
members following an additional week 
of Informal Membership Recruitment. 
Comparatively, nationally sponsored 
sororities like Delta Gamma and Kappa 
Alpha Theta welcomed 27 new sisters 
into each respective house.
As a local sorority, Zeta didnt have 
the resources available to them to help 
them be successful, said Monica Bebie, 
coordinator for Greek Affairs.
Panel discusses RIAA
by Michael R. Fitzgerald

Analogies flew fast and furious 
at the Public Debate on Electronic 
File Sharing hosted by the Univer
sity of Pittsburgh last Friday.
In an October article, The Tar
tan reported that an undisclosed 
amount of students were facing 
subpoenas from the Recording 
Industry Association of Amer
ica (RIAA returns to campus, 
Oct. 10, 2005). Now, four months 
later, the University of Pittsburgh 
invited two involved attorneys 
to discuss the issue in a public 
forum.
For their annual Computer 
Science Day, the University of 
Pittsburgh invited two experts 
to work with two undergradu

Campus stores annually lose money to theft
by Matthew McKee
Staffwriter
Bookstore officials do not 
raise textbook prices just to 
inflate their pocketbooks. 
Last fiscal year, the University 
Shoppe, campus art store, and 
Entropy lost over $150,000 in 
stolen textbooks, souvenirs, 
and other merchandise. Store 
officials said that while lam
entable, this figure remains 
relatively constant from year 
to year.
Its a fairly consistent num
ber, said Patricia Clifford, 
director of Campus Services, 
but it doesnt do the campus 
any good.
The three facilities sold 
roughly $5.6 million in goods 
last year. Typically, the amount 
of stolen products, or shortage, 
makes up about two percent of 
this figure. This number does
not deviate from the amount a 
typical retail store loses to steal
ing in a fiscal year.
The National Association of 
College Stores reports that over 
the 2003-2004 fiscal year, the 
median sales amount for col
lege stores was $3.5 million. 
Nationally, students spent an 
average of $704 during that fis
cal year.
The shortage at Carnegie 
Mellon does not affect student 
tuition, because the stores act 
as auxiliary services of the 
University. Profits earned from 
sales pay for everything that goes 
into keeping any store running. 
Rent, custodial costs, employee 
salaries, credit card fees, and 
software licenses all come from 
the stores dime.
Clifford noted that Carnegie 
Mellon stores would like to rein
vest more of what students spend

Utopianism, video games, 
and sex are this weeks topics in 
the University Lecture Series.
This afternoon, graduate 
students Asi Burak and Eric 
Brown in CMUs Entertainment 
Technology Center will give a 
lecture on the project, a video 
game they developed to simu
late Mideast conflict.
Burak and Brown, co-producers of the PEACEMAKER 
Project, lead a team of graduate 
students dedicated to the cause 
of finding creative solutions to 
resolve Israeli-Palestinian con
flicts.
According to the PEACE
MAKER website, the game is 
designed so that players
choose the role of either the 
Israeli prime minister or the 
leader of the Palestinian 
Authority. The goal is to estab
lish a stable resolution to deadly, 
protracted conflict before the 
politicians terms of office 
expire.
Burak and Brown will speak 
in the Adamson Wing of Baker 
Hall at 4:30 pm.
On Thursday, professor Sarah 
Bryant-Bertail of the University 
of Washington will give a lec
ture titled Nathan the Wise: 
Reviving Utopia. 
Bryant-Bertail is an author 
and essayist on theater perfor
mance, semiotics, feminism, 
and intercultural theater.
Bryant-Bertails lecture will 
center on Nathan the Wise, a 
1779 play by Gotthold Lessing 
that celebrates religious toler
ance in Jerusalem during the 
Crusades.
The lecture title itself gives' 
a sense of the main aim of my 
talk, which is to explore what 
Lessings utopian picture of 
Jerusalem meant to Germany 
in the 1770s, what it has meant 
to successive generations, 
and what it means now in our 
post-9/11, war-torn world, 
Bryant-Bertail stated.
Nathan the Wise: Reviv
ing Utopia will be given in 
the Adamson Wing of Baker 
Hall at 4:30 pm on Thursday, 
February 23.
The keynote speaker for 
MOSAIC, this Saturdays annual 
conference on gender issues, 
will be Dr. Ruth Westheimer, 
one of Peoples Most Intriguing 
People of the Century.
Dr. Ruth, often dubbed the
original sexpert, has hosted 
several television shows and 
written 30 books on the topic of 
sexual health.
Westheimers presentation 
is titled Soldier, Sex Ther
apist, and Mother of the Year: 
Milestones in the Life of Dr. 
Ruth.
According to the MOSAIC 
website, Westheimers speech 
will discuss her life experiences 
as an orphan of the Holocaust, 
a pioneer of media psychology, 
a media personality, and an ad
vocate for Planned Parenthood, 
womens health, and sexual 
literacy.
Westheimer will speak at 
10 am Sunday in McConomy

Last year, student government 
allocated $2.70 from each students 
semesterly fee to The Tartan. Not a bad 
deal for 14 issues.
Around 8500 undergraduate and 
graduate students pay $82 per semes
ter into the student activities fee, most 
of which ends up in an account of about 
$1 million for student organizations. By 
this Friday at midnight, every funded 
student organization will submit its re
quest to get a chunk of that change.
But theres an interesting dimension 
to this funding process, a facet which I 
came to be aware of by accident.
In December 2004, I was elected 
to the post of Executive Officer, now 
called Publisher, after a period of many 
years when The Tartan had neglected 
the business side of its responsibilities. 
There was no business manager, a skel
eton advertising staff, and very little in 
the way of records. I did know, however, 
that The Tartan owed the University 
more than $120,000. How, then, was I 
to go about creating a budget?
I resolved to prevent The Tartan from 
running another year in the red. I pored 
over the last budget The Tartan had 
submitted, what records I could get my 
hands on, and the copies of invoices for 
services rendered and started to put 
together the framework of a budget. 
But between the incomplete data and 
my fear that The Tartan would incur 
more debt, I ended up overestimating 
our costs and underestimating our rev
enues. When I submitted The Tartans 
budget, I was requesting a subsidy of 
$83,337.75. For reference, the year 
prior, The Tartan had only received 
$12,700  part of the reason we owe 
so much money.
Within days, Senators I knew were 
asking me discreetly about the enor
mous figure Id requested. It had made 
quite an impression.
I continued gathering information 
that would help me refine my under
standing of what The Tartan really 
needed. Between the time that I sub
mitted my original budget and when I 
met with the Joint Funding Committee 
(JFC), the group of undergraduate and 
graduate students who review the bud
gets, I realized that the cost of printing 
our newspaper was significantly lower 
than I had originally thought and that 
The Tartan could generate much more 
advertising revenue than Id initially 
believed.
Naturally, when I went before JFC, 
I noted those corrections first thing. It 
brought my requested subsidy down 
to around $36,000. I remember very 
clearly one member of JFC joked that 
Id done their job for them, and they 
didnt even have to discuss trimming 
my budget any further.
Thats when it dawned on me that 
student organizations are very much on 
their honor to request only what they 
need. Had I pushed for the $83,000 
subsidy, The Tartan likely could have 
received a much larger allocation. On 
average, Senate cut about 28 percent 
of initial requests. That would put The 
Tartans subsidy at about $60,000, 
a massive $28,000 more than the 
$32,000 we finally received, and far 
more than we needed. In that case, JFC 
would have been forced to cut nearly 
eight percent more out of every other 
organizations budget, leaving budding 
new organizations especially strapped 
for cash.
Granted, ours was a unique case. 
But it showed me that budget inflation 
can be an effective way of getting more 
 potentially a lot more. The result 
of such deception in extreme cases 
is clearly quite harmful, but the real 
problem is widespread, subtle budget 
inflation, where many organizations 
pump up their numbers in anticipation 
of cuts.
I believe this type of inflation is 
equally as harmful. It makes those who 
are honest and thoughtful about their 
budgeting less likely to get what they 
genuinely need and deserve.
As a prominent organization on 
this campus, The Tartan will lead by 
example. I pledge not to use budget 
inflation to get our way. The Tartan will 
submit a fair and accurate budget.

Alcohol-related incident to blame in Pitt students death
by Shawn Wertz
Assistant News Editor
The recent death of a University of Pitts
burgh student due to intoxication could 
have an impact on the Carnegie Mellon 
community. Leland Holly IV, a 23-yearold junior at Pitt, was pronounced dead 
on February 11. As a result, the Division 
of Student Affairs at Carnegie Mellon is 
wondering if students on campus know 
enough about alcohol consumption.
Holly, a computer science major, fell 
down a set of concrete steps at a party 
hosted by fellow students the previous
night in Greenfield. Witnesses told Pitts
burgh police Holly had been drinking.
Friends thought Holly had passed out, 
as Holly had a history of doing so after 
consuming large amounts of alcohol.
It was only later the next day that po
lice responded to calls that the student 
was dead. A witness told Pittsburgh po
lice that Holly showed no signs of injury 
immediately after the incident.
But when Holly still appeared to be 
unconscious at noon the next day, his 
friends knew that something more seri
ous happened.
The people called 911 sometime 
that afternoon, said Tammy Ewing,
Pittsburgh Police spokeswoman. We 
responded to the scene instead of campus 
police because the event was off-campus 
and we had jurisdiction.

Beauchamp, an attorney for the 
RIAAs own law counseling firm, 
Conrad OBrien Gellman & Rohn, 
and Charles Lee Mudd, president 
of the Charles Mudd Law Offices, 
which has represented several 
defendants in file-sharing 
lawsuits.
Two distinguished University 
of Pittsburgh debaters, junior 
political science major Tony 
DiMattio and junior history 
and philosophy major Melina 
Forte, were paired with the 
attorneys.
DiMattio worked with Mudd in 
support of the proposal under de
bate: Lawsuits against individual 
P2P users should be sharply 
curtailed. Forte and Beau
champ worked against this idea 
together.
there, said Mudd, referring to 
the collective actions of file-sharing programs, file-sharers, pro
gram developers, and the record
ing industry itself.
I must be popular, quipped 
Beauchamp to begin his open
ing statement, referring to his 
association with the RIAA. The 
crowd applauded his statements, 
regardless of any resentful under
currents.
It is wrong, he said, refer
ring to the indisputable fact that 
downloading copyrighted ma
terial, in any form or medium, is 
illegal. His arguments centered 
around this concept.
Beauchamp repeatedly com
pared the music industry on the 
Internet to a shopkeeper in a bad 
neighborhood.
Smith & Barney reports 
that $5.4 billion has been lost to
downloading, Forte informed 
the crowd. She also pointed 
out that statistics could not 
accurately tell how much down
loading would occur without the 
lawsuits.
These lawsuits fail to account 
for individual circumstances, Di
Mattio said.
At the end of the debate, 
the crowd was invited to ask 
questions to the debate panel. 
One audience member com
pared laws in some countries 
that will chop off shoplifters 
arms to lawsuits in the U.S. that 
cost individuals thousands of 
dollars for downloading a few 
songs.
When asked afterwards, three 
of the four participants said 
they support the side for 
which they debated. Forte was 
the only exception.
Propsed budget would affect academiaZeta becomes Alpha Chi Omega
In March 2004, the RIAA 
shifted tactics from a focus 
on sites such as Napster to a 
focus on the individuals down
loading, Mudd said in his open
ing speech.
He detailed one clients 
involvement with the issue: 
After a girls brother was killed 
in gang violence, she inherited 
his laptop. Before she ever used 
the computer, her brother had 
used Kazaa to download songs. 
The client took the computer to 
college with her, where she was 
then subpoenaed for the songs 
that had been previously down
loaded.
Even with a death certificate, 
the RIAA would not drop the 
suit. They are ruthless, Mudd 
said. Mudd suggested that, at 
the very least, a warning should 
be sent to perpetrators, giving
BUDGET, from A1
year in a row that the White 
House has asked Congress to cut 
Perkins from the budget.
[I am] not concerned about 
the loss of the entire fund, An
derson stated. If Congress were 
to eliminate this entire [Perkins] 
program ... requiring the recall 
of funding from colleges over 
a specified periodof time, this 
would impact us. In this case, 
Carnegie Mellon would provide 
new lending opportunities.
Pell Grants remain unchanged 
with the maximum set at $4050. 
The Chronicle of Higher Education 
reports this was the fifth year the 
grant maximum has remained at 
this level. At Carnegie Mellon, an 
estimated 500 students receive 
Pell Grants annually.
Bushs budget funds the Fed
eral Work-Study program at the 
previous years level. As part 
of the Federal Work-Study pro
gram, the government pays up to 
100 percent of a students work 
income. The program allows 
employers to hire students while 
keeping overhead low.
Other need-based programs, 
though, are also facing reduc
tions.
Bushs proposal would also 
terminate the Leveraging Edu
cational Assistance Partner
ships program, according to 
The Chronicle. The $65 million 
LEAP program parallels funding, 
dollar for dollar, based on state 
contributions to low-income 
level recipients.
The proposed budget also 
reduces funding for two of three 
major TRIO programs. Created 
from the 1964 Economic Op
portunity Act, the TRIO program 
serves students pursuing higher 
education. Upon its establish
ment, Congress legislated that 
two-thirds of people served by 
TRIO programs must come from 
low income families.
Seeking to close the Congres
sional Budget Offices estimated 
$270 billion budget deficit, the 
Bush administrations budgetary 
reasoning relies on the recently 
established Program Assessment 
Rating Tool (PART). The Office 
of Management and Budget and 
federal agencies use the PART 
program to assess performance 
of over 800 federal programs.
For example, PART gives the 
Perkins program a rating of in
effective, citing the program 
as redundant and duplicative, 
given the broad availability of 
need-based, subsidized, relatively
low-interest loans through the ... 
Federal Family Education Loans 
and Ford Direct Student Loans.
There are also budget propos
als that affect students without 
relying on cuts. To reflect the 
latest White House initiatives, 
the proposed budget increases 
spending in areas of mathemat
ics and science.
The budget proposes an eight 
percent increase in the National 
Science Foundations (NSF) 
budget to $6.02 billion. While 
funding has increased for the 
NSF, other programs are experi
encing no change.
The National Institutes of 
Health (NIH), self-described on 
its website as the primary Fed
eral agency for conducting and 
supporting medical research, 
has its budget remaining at 
$28.59 billion.
While the sciences are being 
bolstered, arts and humanities 
face budget reductions. The bud
get reduces Arts in Education by 
$35 million, while funding the 
National Endowment for the 
Humanities and the National 
Endowment for the Arts at $141 
million and $125 million, re
spectively. The funding levels of 
these two National Endowment 
programs show no increase over 
the previous years level.
If this budget is adopted as 
proposed, some lending pro
grams would be eliminated or 
changed, and educational financ
ing issues grow more complex for 
Carnegie Mellon students.
Carnegie Mellon is fortunate to 
have students whose default rates 
are the lowest in the nation, An
derson stated. [Carnegie Mellon 
has] or would create financing 
partnerships which would give 
our students the best borrower 
benefits and APRs.
The budget proposes some 
new financing opportunities. The 
budget would create Academic 
Competitiveness grants. These 
grants have a math and science 
preference and could combine 
with new grant programs for 
students who meet Pell Grant 
requirements.
This is good news, Anderson 
said.
Either budgeted or interestrate-based changes in the lending 
environment can be confusing 
for students. Some students are 
taking action to secure their 
financial standing.
I searched [loan consolida
tion] out on my own after seeing 
it mentioned on the news, and 
the change was as simple as fill
ing out a form on their website, 
said Matt Yeager, a senior in elec
trical and computer engineering.
Students who meet minimum 
borrowing requirements and 
have these current variable 
Stafford interest rates should 
consider consolidating before 
July 1,2006, Anderson said.

GREEK, from A1
In October, following the dis
appointing rush, Zeta Psi Sigma 
issued a letter that announced 
the decision to open the Greek 
community here for expansion to 
the 22 national sororities avail
able for colonization on Carnegie 
Mellons campus.
To aid them in making their 
final choice, Zeta invited four of 
the 22 national sororities to visit 
campus during the first two weeks 
of the spring semester.
After spending time with most 
of the women in the chapter, we 
left campus knowing we would be 
proud to affiliate with them and 
establish a new Alpha Chi Omega 
chapter at Carnegie Mellon Uni
versity, stated Alpha Chi Omegas 
executive director Suzette Bewley 
Mathis in a press release issued 
from the sororitys Indianapolis 
headquarters.
Bebie, who was heavily involved
in the process, concurs. We 
were focused on helping these 
women transition from being a 
local organization to a national 
organization. Alpha Chi Omega 
is a perfect fit for the Greek com
munity here at Carnegie Mellon 
University, she said.
Zeta Psi Sigma is now recog
nized as the Kappa Nu Chapter 
of Alpha Chi Omega, and coloni
zation will begin March 1. Now, 
five of the 26 national sororities 
that are governed by the Na
tional Panhellenic Council are 
represented at Carnegie Mellon: 
Delta Delta Delta, Delta Gamma, 
Kappa Alpha Theta, Kappa Kappa 
Gamma, and Alpha Chi Omega.
Alpha Chi Omega will incor
porate Zetas history and current 
sisters into the new sorority as 
it begins its own history here on 
Margaret Morrison Street. During 
fall of next year, AXQ will open 
bids to new sisters, but Moroco 
points out, [Zetas] rituals and
tradition will cease to exist.
Zeta will adopt AXQs colors, 
motto, emblems, and traditions 
along with a number of other 
rituals as dictated by the national 
organization.
The sorority must also choose a 
new charitable organization and 
cause to which to donate. As op
posed to Zetas freedom as a local 
sorority to choose a new cause 
each year, AXQ as a national or
ganization works to eliminate 
domestic violence in the United 
States.
Though some practices will be 
lost, much can be gained in this 
change.
Traditionally, when you add 
another [national organization to 
the Greek community], it sparks 
interest in Greek life, Bebie said. 
The other four organizations 
have been extremely, extremely 
supportive in the process. It was 
difficult for them to see Zeta 
struggle.
Following low recruitment levels, Zeta Psi Sigma, the only local sorority on campus, is joining the national chap
ter of Alpha Chi Omega. Not all of the current 28 members are pictured.

THE TARTAN  FEBRUARY 20, 2006
Secretary of Education considers standardized tests for college
TESTS, from Al
When you [take standardized tests] in 
high school, its only to see where you fit 
into that picture.
William Elliott, Carnegie Mellons vice 
president for enrollment, agreed. He be
lieves there are several ways to measure 
students progress other than adminis
tering a test.
What about a review of course de
scriptions? he asked. Review grade 
patterns, review writing samples of sub
mitted coursework, GRE/LAST/MCAT 
results ... the list goes on.
What many dont know, however, is 
that this is not the first attempt at stan
dardized testing in higher education. 
Several years ago, the University of 
Texas instituted standardized testing as 
a means of assessing students perfor
mance across nine campuses. To do this, 
they developed a test called the Colle
giate Learning Assessment to administer 
to all University of Texas students.
In October 2005, when the Commis
sion on the Future of Higher Education 
first met under the direction of Secre
tary of Education Margaret Spellings 
and chairman of the commission Charles 
Miller, that test served as a model during 
discussion of the national test, according 
to a January 6 article in The Chronicle of 
Higher Education.
Also prominent in the commissions 
discussion was the effect of standardized 
tests on colleges affordability. Officials 
believe that students families, who 
shoulder most of the financial burden of 
sending their children to college, deserve 
a more quantitative way to assess the 
progress of their children compared to 
students overall, and in turn, assess the 
quality of the institution to which they 
are making out their checks.
The test results would also be a way for 
prospective students and their families to 
decide if a particular institution is worth 
the financial investment.
The government would also like to 
see the progress of the colleges to which 
it is sending student aid. However,
its interest in standardized testing is 
more complicated.
According to The Chronicle of Higher 
Education, the commission is interested 
in making a schools eligibility for federal 
funding contingent on standardized test
ing scores as an incentive for schools to 
submit to government regulation.
Public universities are most at risk for 
the mandate because they are funded by 
state taxes. However, private colleges are 
also at risk. The accreditation they cur
rently need from the federal government 
to operate requires them to meet certain 
standards in order to receive federal 
grants and financial aid, according to The 
New York Times.
Elliott does not support this type of 
regulation. Outcomes should be the key 
objective, not cost, he stated.
Another pull is the federal accredi
tation a school would receive once it 
agreed to administer the exam. The 
commissions theory is that this kind of 
accreditation would be attractive to the 
schools prospective students and create
a more competitive applicant pool.
Elliott noted that, though Carnegie 
Mellon is a competitive university that 
would rank highly in this respect, the ac
creditation would not be an incentive for 
the University to administer the test.
The commission claimed as an advan
tage that the test would lend more merit 
to nontraditional courses, such as those 
taken online. However, critics argued 
that it would discount other methods of 
learning, such as hands-on or firsthand 
experience in a field.
It would also assume that all students 
had used the same method of learning, in 
essence testing a national curriculum.
The notion of a single exam implies 
there are national standards, and that 
implies a national curriculum. Then we 
are on the way to a centralized Prussian 
education system, said David L. Warren, 
president of the National Association of 
Independent Colleges and Universities, 
to The New York Times.
The test would also highlight the rea
sons behind racial gaps, bad literacy test
results, and universities continuing fail
ure to graduate enough math and science 
students to meet the domestic demand 
for high-tech workers.
The New York Times reported that a 
2003 National Assessment of Adult Lit
eracy indicated that less than one-third of 
surveyed college graduates demonstrated 
the ability to read complex texts in English 
and make insightful inferences.
Professors would start teaching for 
the test instead of what they thought was 
important, Brown said. The govern
ment would ultimately be dictating what 
we need to learn in college. Its insulting 
to the institutions.
Colleges have reputations anyway. 
Why do we need another way to measure 
that? asked Karen Doersch, a first-year 
cognitive science major. A private insti
tution should be independent from the 
government.
The Universitys administration agrees. 
When asked what local reactions might 
be like if the tests were to be adminis
tered, Elliott answered: Not pleased.
American students not prepared in math, sciences
PREP, from Al
Americans catch up, generally, as 
curriculum continues, he added.
The Chronicle of Higher Education re
ported that much of the debate on how 
to approach this issue has centered on 
the use of Advanced Placement courses. 
Spellings emphasized the unfortunate 
disparities between a high school in a 
wealthy suburb of Washington, D.C., 
with more than 20 AP classes, and an 
inner-city school in Washington with 
four such classes.
With the way we ration these 
courses, you would think we dont 
want students to take them, said 
Spellings, referring to Advanced Place
ment math and science courses. She 
spoke before the Committee on Health, 
Education, Labor, and Pensions at a 
February 9 hearing to discuss Presi
dent Bushs American Competitiveness 
Initiative.
Under the initiative, 70,000 new 
teachers would be trained to teach 
AP and International Baccalaureate 
courses in math and science.
I dont have much faith in AP 
exams.... We need people who know 
how to think, not people who have a 
set of skills, Mackey said.
Spellings, on the other hand, spoke 
in support of the Presidents Ameri
can Competitiveness Initiative, while 
several senators expressed their 
concerns.
According to The Chronicle, Sena
tor Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) 
warned that increased spending on 
Advanced Placement courses might 
create a greater divide between privi
leged and needy children, instead of 
lifting the whole generation.
Senator Judd Gregg, (R-N.H.), op
posed Kennedy, citing the creation of 
 opportunities for high achievers as a 
top priority.
Senator Patty Murray (D-Wash.) 
expressed concerns over the much 
broader issue of federal financial aid 
programs.
You can focus on math all you 
want, she said, but theyre going to 
say, Im never going to be able to afford
to go [to college].
Following on the heels of the commit
tee was a February 13 Time Magazine 
feature, Are We Losing Our Edge? 
In this report, Time details Americas 
decline in the sciences after a 
half-century of dominance. The 
report attributed this decline to a 
gradual, three-decade cutback in 
federal research and development 
investment.
According to Time, corporations 
issuing similar cutbacks, seeking quick 
profits as a result of stockholder pres
sure, have underpinned the effects of 
federal cutbacks.
Meanwhile, according to the Time 
report, and as iterated by last weeks 
hearing, standards seem to have 
dropped in American elementary 
and high school math and science 
education.
As far as standardized tests, 
Americans are among the mid-level 
to bottom, Mackey said. The issue is 
more subtle than that.
He noted that, in the 14 years he 
has taught at Carnegie Mellon, 
American students havent gotten 
worse  theyve even gotten margin
ally better. International students, 
he said, have just excelled more.
Last summer, the National Acade
mies of Sciences and Engineering pro
duced a 505-page report, called Rising 
Above the Gathering Storm: Energizing 
and Employing America for a Brighter 
Economic Future. Co-authored by 
CEOs, Nobel prize winners, university 
presidents, and distinguished scien
tists, the report outlined a grim situa
tion in nearly every area of research.
Partisan tug-of-war aside, the Time 
article specifies the ways in which 
other countries are attracting top sci
entists, typically after being trained by 
American universities such as Carnegie 
Mellon.
The Tartan reported in the December 
5 issue that the international student 
population has been on the rise for 
the past two years. The Carnegie In
stitute of Technology receives many 
of these students, holding 295 of the 
universitys 2071 international
students.
This rise is in opposition to a national 
current.
We are out-trending national trends 
at CMU. But were no longer growing at 
the breakneck pace as we were before, 
said Lisa Krieg, director of the Office of 
International Education at Carnegie 
Mellon.
Despite the intellectual diffusion 
occurring at Carnegie Mellon, Time 
reported that graduates are increas
ingly attracted by better funding in 
other countries for job-seeking scien
tists.
I am definitely going abroad 
for work after I graduate, said Joe 
Lawrence, a senior physics major. 
Everyone in the sciences knows that 
there is more money overseas for our 
work.
Finland, South Korea, Singapore, 
and especially China have gradually 
increased focus on sciences, following 
the lead of the American post-World 
War II research culture.
With three decades of deficits in 
this country, research funds are being 
scaled back across the board. Mean
while, countries like China have lured 
81 percent of its Chinese Academy of 
Sciences members back from study 
abroad on the back of a 120 percent 
increase in science investments from
1999 to 20Q4.
Steven Chu, director of the Lawrence 
Berkeley National Laboratory in Berke
ley, and a 1997 Nobelist in physics told 
Time that more than simple funding, 
these countries are determined to re
produce the spirit of wide-open inquiry 
that has made U.S. science so appeal
ing and successful.
Give me two more hours with a kid 
a day, and of course theyll do better in 
math. But at what expense? Mackey 
said.
He questioned the validity of the 
current non-American teaching mod
els, noting that foreign models often 
focus on math and sciences, while 
compromising arts, music, and the hu
manities.
Will you have to shortchange them 
in some areas?
Campus stores lose money

measures are more passive than active. To 
catch thieves that range in identity from 
Carnegie Mellon students to professional 
criminals, the store uses video monitors 
and trains its staff to deal with customers 
walking out with merchandise.

ingness to stereotype against any group 
of people.

Entropy is one of several campus stores that loses considerable money every year.
The bookstore currently increases 
textbook prices by 25 percent. Kownacki 
noted if the store switched to a system 
of closed stacks  a process in which 
students do not directly access books and 
clerks retrieve requests manually  the 
shortages could be cut and increase 
margins could be lowered to about 22 
percent.
However,, he said, space constraints 
make this switch unfeasible.
We cant do much more, Kownacki 
said. We dont want to come off like we 
dont trust the students.
Clifford believes that using a clerk ser
vice to access closed textbooks stacks 
would slow the process down and do less 
for the campus community. For Clifford, 
the open shelves benefit the campus more 
by allowing customers to freely browse 
and purchase materials outside their 
study focuses.
We wanted to build a store that suits 
everybodys needs, said Clifford. I think 
to rope that off would be a disservice. 
According to Kownacki, current security
to be suspicious.
The Computer Store, whose short
ages are not included in the $150,000 
mentioned, recently moved into the UC 
basement with the textbook store. Its posi
tion among the hardest-hit section of the 
University Shoppe does not seem to worry 
employees.
Sales Consultant Jaison Palermo said 
the Computer Store has always had a 
handful of items go missing at each 
inventory. He notes that small items, like 
rewritable compact disc packs, usually go 
missing but that big items, like computers, 
generally stay put.
I dont think its really been a huge 
problem, Palermo said.
If the level of shortage remains con
stant for the other three stores, however, 
consistent but typical losses in the six
digit range will remain as thieves walk 
away with merchandise.
Despite their consistency, these figures 
frustrate Clifford.
[Stealing is] just not the act of a good 
citizen, said Clifford.

Automakers mark 2006 a retro year for new models
by Albert Lin
Staffwriter
This years Pittsburgh International Auto 
Show was held at the David L. Lawrence 
Convention Center in the downtown area 
adjacent to the Strip District. Featuring 
over 40 carmakers and over 20 individual 
vendors, the show completely filled the two 
floors with the best and freshest models on 
the market today, along with some concept 
vehicles. There were plenty of offerings 
from the traditionally economical brands 
alongside an equal showing of luxury and 
exotic brands.
The Big Three (Ford, GM, and DaimerChrysler) presented their top-of-theline vehicles, including a debut of Fords 
Shelby GT500 and Chevrolets Corvette 
Z06. Recent financial struggles for all 
three of these companies have not stopped 
them from releasing new vehicle lineups, 
but rather have encouraged them to make 
business re-evaluations and freshen up 
their offerings.
Fords booth highlighted its performance 
image and drive to deliver powerful, Amer
ican muscle. The company delved deep into 
its roots to bring back the Shelby, which is 
associated with the late-1960s legacy of ve
hicles that dominated automobile racing. 
The most noticeable vehicle on display 
was its Shelby GR1 concept vehicle, which 
featured an all-aluminum body and was 
modeled after the Shelbys of old.
The star of Fords display was the allnew Shelby GT500, which is based on 
the new Mustang platform  of which 
Carnegie Mellon graduate Hau Thai-Tang 
was chief engineer  and was inspired by 
the 1960s AC Cobra. The GT500 takes the 
Mustang GT platform and showers it with 
subtle styling cues, such as front air split
ters, a rear deck spoiler, and Shelby and 
Cobra emblems all over the car. It shares 
the 5.4 liter V8 platform found in the Mus
tang GT and Ford GT, and is supercharged 
to 475 horsepower with matching torque 
and linked to a six-speed transmission. An 
upgraded suspension by Fords in-house 
SVT performance group steers the car, and 
large 14-inch brakes help stop it. Poised to 
sell at under $50,000, this special vehicle 
is sure to fill preorders as soon as they ap
pear. Ford plans to release limited numbers 
of the GT500 starting this summer.
The Ford GT supercar also made an apJ.T. Trollman/Contributing Editor
Ford released its Shelby GR-1 concept in 2005, making it one of the newer elegant concept cars on display at the Pittsburgh Auto Show. A 
functional model in a full-body chrome finish, the car is run by a 6.4-liter, 605 horsepower V10 engine. Also on display were the 2003 Dodge 
Kahuna, the 1997 Chrysler Phaeton, and a revised version of the 2002 Jeep Compass concept.
pearance and impressed many with its 
astounding 550 horsepower and 500 foot
pounds of torque. To put it in perspective, 
this kind of power accelerates you from 
zero to 60 mph in about 3.4 seconds, all 
in first gear, and can outrun Ferraris and 
Porsches. Ford actually brought the GT to 
the Technical Opportunities Conference 
back in fall 2005, and many students were 
able to experience the thrills of this Ameri
can legend. Ford also displayed its F-series 
pickup trucks and economy Focus lineup, 
each model receiving minor facelifts for 
the 2006 model year.
Chevrolet came in featuring their new 
SS concept vehicle and top-of-the-line 
Corvette Z06. The General Motors com
pany, as well as Ford and Chrysler Group, 
is launching 2006 as the year to revitalize 
the retro-styling of the 60s. The not-sonew SSR and HHR models mix old classic 
styling with modern technology. The SS 
concept also plays off the mesh of old and
new with its large, exaggerated propor
tions and smooth aerodynamics. Chevro
lets move towards its roots in American 
muscle car history carries over into its clas
sic American sports car, the Corvette. The 
new Corvette debuted in the 2005 model 
year and has projector headlamps for the 
first time. (Previous generations all had 
pop-up headlamps.) The Corvette comes 
with a newly developed LS7 V8 engine, 
which' is the most powerful engine GM 
Group has ever offered, and on the Z06, 
that means 500 horsepower mated to a sixspeed transmission and 0-60 in under four 
seconds.
Thats some serious power. In fact, many 
say the Z06 is the best-kept secret amongst 
supercars, as its base price of just under 
$66,000 is a bargain relative to its peers, 
the Ford GT and Dodge Viper SRT-10. The 
new body style also updates the Corvettes 
aggressive demeanor and hints at the Sting 
Ray Corvettes of the 60s with its truncated
and raised back end.
The Cobalt shared some spotlight 
in Chevys booth. The Cobalt comes as 
the direct replacement of the Cavalier, 
Chevrolets economy car. It has a better 
visual appeal than the dated Cavalier 
and comes in many trim lines, of which 
the SS supercharged version is the most 
potent. The variety of the Cobalt models 
reflects General Motors efforts to appeal 
to a wider audience, especially with the 
growing interest for inexpensive, reli
able vehicles.
Chrysler Groups exhibition showed 
off its new Dodge lineup, showcasing 
the new SRT Chargers. The SRT name 
indicates the in-house tuning division 
for Dodge on its high-performance ve
hicles. The SRT Chargers have rolled 
fresh off the assembly lines. The retro 
trend is again apparent with Dodge, as

Fiber optics celebrates 40th anniversary with new innovations
by Jaisen Bell
Staffwriter
Happy 40th! Thats right, fiber 
optics technology is over the hill. 
Not retiring or fizzling out, this 
technology continues to improve 
with age and is still a driving force 
in the ways in which we make 
telephone calls, watch cable TV, 
and use the Internet.
Before fiber optic technology 
was developed, electronic com
munication was conducted over 
copper lines with information 
passed via electrons. The ineffi
ciencies associated with copper
technology over long distances 
spawned the need for something 
better.
Courtesy of www.wonderquest.com
In 1966, two engineers at Stan
dard Telecommunication Labo
ratories, Charles Kao and George
Hockham, toyed with the idea 
that glass fibers could be used 
to transfer information by light. 
Thus began fiber optics and the 
eventual ability to transmit tera
bits of information per second.
Meanwhile, Carnegie Mellon 
was in the process of develop
ing its new computer science 
PhD program. This time pe
riod represented an advent of 
technology and acted as a prelude 
to the future and the continued 
maturation of technology and 
global communication.
The ability to transfer infor
mation via photons through fiber 
optical cable has allowed for
an incomparable speed to be 
reached over the conventional 
electron transfer method, said 
Joseph Laws, a graduate stu
dent in electrical and computer 
engineering.
As fiber optics technology 
developed, companies began 
to lay undersea cable, leading 
to the almost instantaneous 
transmission of data across the 
oceans.
During the tech boom of 
the late 1990s, many people 
invested heavily in a fiber op
tic infrastructure with the

How Things Work: Diet Pills
Kath, Chmaoamkwo
Melt away those pounds! 
Lose 30 pounds in 30 days! 
Control your appetite! In soci
ety today, self-image is greatly 
emphasized. Magazines and 
television shows advertise slim, 
sexy-looking bodies. In addi
tion, with more than 60 per
cent of Americans overweight 
or obese, losing weight quickly 
sounds more enticing and easier 
than diet or exercise.
There are many kinds of diet 
pills. Appetite suppressants, 
such as sibutramine or phentermine, affect the hypothalamus, 
which regulates appetite. These 
suppressants block the reuptake 
of serotonin and norepineph
rine. The chemicals accumulate 
in your brain after you eat a 
big meal and cause you to feel 
full. Certain diet pills block the 
hormone ghrelin, which is sent 
by the stomach to the brain to 
stimulate hunger. Other diet 
pills mimic Peptide YY3-36 
(PYY) hormone, which tells the 
brain that the stomach is full.
Weight-loss supplements can 
utilize different ingredients to 
aid in dieting. Herbal ephedra, 
caffeine, guarana, and coun
try mallow increase the bodys 
metabolism. Guar gum, glucomannan, and psyllium cause a 
full feeling. Hydrocitric acid, 
green tea, conjugated linoleic 
acid, and pyruvate slow down 
fat production. Chitosan, also 
known as chitin, blocks fat from 
being absorbed.
There are also prescription 
fat blockers, which inhibit the 
action of the lipase enzyme. 
This enzyme breaks down the 
fat in foods we eat. When this 
enzyme is inhibited, ingested 
fat is removed from the body in
stead of being broken down and 
absorbed. Orlistat (Xenical) is a 
diet pill that works in the gas
trointestinal tract, blocking the 
lipase enzyme. Up to one third 
of the fat consumed will accu
mulate in the intestines and be 
excreted.
Ephedra and caffeine was 
once an extremely powerful but 
dangerous combination used in 
diet pills. The caffeine increased 
metabolism by increasing the 
breakdown of fatty acids, and 
the ephedrine reduced appetite 
by acting on the hypothalamus. 
Since late 2003, the FDA has 
banned all ephedra-containing 
drugs because of ephedras links 
to heart attacks. Now, ephedra 
is being replaced with vitamins 
like thiamin, riboflavin, and fo
lic acid, which also increase en
ergy and metabolism.
There are many side effects 
of using diet pills. Appetite 
suppressants stimulate the 
sympathetic nervous system 
and cause blood pressure and 
heart rate to rise. Minor side 
effects include headache, dry 
mouth, and insomnia. Certain 
pills, like the pills that block 
the action of lipase enzymes, 
reduce the bodys absorption 
of essential fat-soluble vitamins 
A, D, E, and K, and other nutri
ents. In addition, herbal does 
not imply safe or healthy. 
Some fat-burning herbs contain 
ingredients that have diuretic 
properties; they cause water 
loss, not fat loss. When the 
numbers on the scale go down, 
you havent lost weight: youve 
just lost water.
Do diet pills really work? 
Most diet pills have been shown 
to help dieters lose a couple 
pounds over a short period of 
time  usually six months or 
less. After a while, the body de
velops a tolerance to the drugs 
effects. These drugs are also 
only effective if you continue to 
eat healthy and exercise. Diet 
pills are mainly designed for 
those suffering obesity. Nowa
days, they are used to replace 
exercise ^id healthy eating.

Japanese police raid 
over bioweapons fear
Police in Japan have raided two 
firms on suspicion of illegally sell
ing equipment to North Korea that 
could be used to make biological 
weapons. The Tokyo companies 
are suspected of exporting equip
ment in 2002 that could cultivate 
the germs used in such weapons. 
The two unnamed companies 
were reported to have sent their 
exports to North Korea via Taiwan. 
The companies are suspected of 
infringing the Foreign Exchange

Latest Mac OS warns 
hackers with poem
Apple Computer, Inc., has re
sorted to a poetic broadside in the 
inevitable cat-and-mouse game 
between hackers and high-tech 
companies. The maker of Macin
tosh computers had anticipated 
that hackers would try to crack 
its new OS X operating system 
built to work on Intel chips and 
run pirated versions on non-Apple 
computers. So, Apple developers 
embedded a warning deep in the 
software  in the form of a poem. 
A copy of it has been circulating on 
Mac-related Web sites this week.
Apple confirmed Thursday that 
it has included such a warning in 
its Intel-based computers since it 
started selling them in January. 
The embedded poem reads: Your 
karma check for today: There once 
was a user that whined/his exist
ing OS was so blind/hed do better 
to pirate/an OS that ran great/but 
found his hardware declined./ 
Please dont steal Mac OS 1/Really, 
thats way uncool./(C) Apple 
Computer, Inc. Apple also put a 
separate hidden message, Dont 
Steal Mac OS X.kext, in another 
spot for would-be hackers.

before Congress on charges that 
they collaborated with Beijing 
to crush free speech online in 
return for market access. It is 
normal for countries to manage 
the Internet in accordance with

Experiment of the Week: Dark matter brought to new light by Cambridge
Courtesy of www.cfsd.kl2.az.us
According to the research groups findings our galaxy, the Milky Way, 
would be much larger than originally thought when taking into account 
dark matter corrections.
by Siobhan Toal
Junior Staffwriter
Scientists have been plagued 
with the problem of proving the 
facts that explain theory for many 
centuries. Until recently, one of 
the key issues in astronomy, the 
existence of dark matter, has been 
greatly debated. This great debate 
has been due to a lack of evidence 
supporting dark matter theory.
Dark matter, as implied by 
the name, refers to particles of 
unknown composition that cant 
be visibly seen or analytically 
detected due to their lack of 
electromagnetic radiation emis
sion or light reflection. Then why, 
one might ask, is there reason to 
believe this dark matter really 
exists? The answer is simple
 although dark matter cannot 
be detected directly, its presence 
can be deduced from the other
wise unexplainable gravitational 
effects of stars and galaxies in 
space.
This hypothetical explanation 
was first conjured up by Swiss as
trophysicist Fritz Zwicky in 1933, 
and has been debated ever since. 
The presence of this material can
only be inferred from inconsis
tencies with gravitational effects 
of galaxy orbits. The way that gal
axies rotate, for example, defies 
Einsteins general theory of rela
tivity. Stars move so fast that they 
should, if they stick to relativity 
laws, fly far apart. Instead, what 
is observed seems to indicate the
existance of extra, unseen mass 
that creates adequate gravita
tional attraction for the stars to 
remain intact in orbit. For more 
information on dark matter and 
dark energy, read our previous 
article, How Things Work: Dark 
energy at The Tartan Online.
Although some scientists dis
agree on the range, many believe 
that dark matter would make up 
approximately 80 to 90 percent of 
the matter in the universe. Many 
scientists agree that dark matter 
is the best explanation for incon
sistencies with gravitational-mass 
problems; however, there has 
been no take-home proof of these 
particles until now.
Recently, a group of scientists 
from the University of Cambridge 
published a statement saying that 
they were able, for the first time, 
to analyze some of the physical 
properties of the mysterious dark 
matter. This team, led by pro
fessor Gerry Gilmore, has been 
working on the dark matter prob
lem since 2003. The Cambridge 
team did much of their research 
using the Very Large Telescope 
facility, located in Chile. This fa
cility contains a system of four of 
the largest optical telescopes in 
the world. Using these facilities, 
the group was able to observe 
and analyze a number of small 
galaxies that lie just outside our 
very own Milky Way galaxy.
Through the Cambridge teams 
observations, they were able 
to create various maps of these 
galaxies and calculate the move
ment of their stars. The intricate 
part of their research was the cre
ation of thousands of these 3-D 
galaxy maps. With these maps, it 
was possible for them to outline 
the existence of dark matter in 
galaxies. Eventually, after taking 
more than 7000 separate mea
surements, the team was able to 
calculate the mass of the mystery 
matter. The mass determined, 
referred to by Gilmore as having 
a magic volume, corresponds 
to an amount that is 30 million 
times the mass of the sun. From 
this information, the group was 
able to determine the speed of 
the particles to be 9 km/s and the 
temperature to be somewhere 
around 10,000 C  much hotter 
than the suns surface!
Gilmore regards his teams 
research as an ongoing search 
into the truth of our universe. 
The most interesting aspect of 
this research is not what we have 
measured  rather, I find it re
markable, and humbling, that 
we are able to identify and study 
the reality which is the universe, 
even though that reality is so very 
different from that which we see 
every day, said Gilmore. The 
Cambridge team hopes to submit

their results to an astrophysics * 
journal sometime soon.
These research findings, if *
reproducable, will have an enormous effect on how astronomers 
view the universe. The existence 
of dark matter will allow for a 
more complete and accurate de
piction of galaxy structure and 
composition. Dark matter may litf 
erally change our universe.

The Robert L. Preger Intelligent 
Workplace here at Carnegie

Allison explained, however, 
that with the dot-com bubble

in communication protocols, the 
demand has flatlined and a large 
amount of installed fiber optic 
cable goes unused to this day.
As a result, the cost of using

Once this process is mastered 
we will have much higher data

Research Profiles: Biology

Have you ever wondered how 
the learning process occurs 
or how memory works? What 
exactly goes on in the brain that 
helps us do these things?
The brain is one of the most in
triguing structures of the human 
anatomy. However, very little is 
known about it. Jay McClelland, 
the Walter Van Dyke Bingham 
Professor of Psychology and Cog
nitive Neuroscience at Carnegie 
Mellon, is currently trying to ad
dress a few cognitive neurosci
ence issues in learning, memory, 
and language at an abstract neurocomputational level.
Language learning is often 
very difficult. Learning and 
actively practicing vocabulary, 
grammar, and sentence forma
tions are critical. Have you ever 
wondered why you did not have 
to go through this tedious rou
tine to learn your mother tongue 
or native language? You just 
knew it.
McClellands lab is involved in 
a project that tries to learn the 
development of language and 
the sensitive period in which lan
guage learning is accomplished. 
He also attempts to understand 
why people fail to distinguish be
tween sounds that are not used 
in their spoken language. For ex
ample, Japanese adults are often 
incapable of distinguishing be
tween the I and r sounds. Some 
approaches suggest this inability 
is caused by a simple switch
ing-off of learning about speech 
sounds as a function of age or pu, Courtesy of Jay McClellandCMU Professor Jay McClelland
berty. McClellands view is that the 
switching-off is the result of learn
ing. As the child develops in his or 
her native language environment, 
the unused sounds cause certain 
neurons to be incapable of firing. 
On the other hand, as a particular 
sound is used frequently, the con
nections between the neurons be
come stronger.
As McClelland put it, As an 
individual grows, the production 
and processing of new sounds be
comes difficult. But my students 
and I continue to hope that we can 
find new ways to rewire the neces
sary connections.
Other aspects of McClellands 
research include trying to under
stand the processing of memory 
and the ability of individuals to 
differentiate between objects. 
For example, what constitutes 
a persons ability to distinguish 
between a cat and a tiger? Experi
ments are currently being done 
on patients whose ability to make 
a distinction between different 
objects is lost. Such patients suffer 
from semantic dementia, a degenerative disease seen in people over 
the age of 50.
These patients are made to take 
a pyramids and palm trees test 
where they are asked to distin
guish between 400 different pic
tures. Since this process of inabil
ity to distinguish is a gradual one, 
the ability to tell the difference be
tween similar objects is first lost. 
For example, patients first lose 
the ability to distinguish between 
two birds and, as the disease pro
gresses, they could even fail to tell 
an elephant apart from a dog.
In the lab, there is a computer
ized simulation of the brain which 
attempts to understand the cause 
of this disorder by temporal lobe 
atrophy. This is not due to im
paired vision. When the patients 
are asked to copy objects that rep
resent animals, they copy them 
just fine. If the object is taken 
away, however, they are unable to 
draw a picture which resembles 
the animal. This disease is differ
ent from Alzheimers disease in 
that it is a presentation of the 
knowledge that is impaired.
So where does all this re
search lead us? We are trying to 
establish a useful framework for 
understanding developmental 
processes, said McClelland. His 
lab is trying to develop a concep
tual representation of the brain 
that may be useful in address
ing other questions regarding its 
structural functions. My own role 
in this research will be to try to 
understand better how different 
parts of the brain work together 
when we think and learn, said 
McClelland. This will be useful in 
helping people with other disor
ders and diseases such as autism.

GM advertises ethanol-fueled cars
At the Chicago Auto Show two 
weeks ago, General Motors showered 
a Chevrolet with an avalanche of pop
corn to kick off their new Live Green, 
Go Yellow campaign. Theyve since 
been blanketing the major media with 
advertisements designed to let you know 
that theyre serious about alternative 
fuels.
Specifically, theyre promoting E85, a 
mixture of 85 percent ethanol to 15 per
cent gasoline. Typical gasoline already 
has about 10 percent ethanol mixed in, 
but more widespread use of E85 could 
ease the United States dependence on 
foreign oil. Not to mention that its a re
newable resource, distilled from good old 
American corn  hence the popcorn.
GM is proud that 1.5 million vehicles 
theyve sold in the last five years can 
already run on E85. DaimlerChrysler 
is doing much the same, and Ford 
might even be further ahead on the E85 
bandwagon, as theyve been putting E85- 
capable engines in their cars since 1995. 
These flexible-fuel vehicles, or FFVs, can 
run on any mixture of ethanol and gaso
line, from no ethanol at all up to 85 per
cent, and there are millions of these cars 
already on the road.
But there are several barriers in this 
otherwise positive scenario: Its virtually 
impossible to fill up a car with E85 in this
country. Of the roughly 170,000 gas sta
tions in the U.S., some 600 have E85, and 
the vast majority of those are in the heart 
of the Corn Belt. For example, there isnt 
a single publicly-accessible E85 pump in 
the entire state of Pennsylvania.
Even though E85s 105 octane rating 
means increased horsepower and torque, 
it contains 28 percent less energy per unit 
volume than gasoline, which decreases 
gas mileage. Therefore, the price of E85 
must be 28 percent less than gasoline 
to be economically viable, since it takes 
more fuel to go the same distance. The 
price briefly reached this crucial level 
late last year, but recent legislation and 
less inflated gasoline prices have made 
E85 less competitive.
Great debates are currently raging 
over whether or not corn-based ethanol 
production is economically viable, but 
they fail to take one important factor 
into account. Due to federally-mandated 
agriculture subsidies, many corn farms 
in the U.S. are actually being paid to 
throw away large portions of their crop. 
If all of this corn is simply going to 
waste, having it go to fuel instead would 
not only be cost-effective, but could po
tentially increase the natural price of 
corn enough to obviate the need for the 
aforementioned subsidies.
With any luck, as awareness grows,
demand will increase. Prices jumped ear
lier this year when the federal govern
ment mandated that all of its own FFVs 
must be run on E85 whenever possible. 
New legislation gives huge bonuses to gas 
station owners who add E85 pumps to 
their stations, and states like Minnesota 
are gradually increasing the minimum 
amount of ethanol that must be added 
to gasoline.
The United States should follow the 
example of Brazil, where vast open farms 
dominate the countryside just as they 
do here. But there, more than a quar
ter of the vehicles on the road run on 
pure ethanol distilled from that nations 
huge crop of sugar cane. Brazils gov
ernment forced a switch to ethanol in 
order to lessen foreign dependence and 
strengthen the local economy. It has 
done wonders in both sectors. Pure etha
nol wouldnt work in cars in the United 
States because of differences in weather 
conditions, but Brazils example shows 
that renewable fuels can be extremely 
successful on a national scale.
Automotive technology has finally ad
vanced to the point where its viable to 
use a fuel source that makes much more 
sense to our national economy and our 
environment. General Motors should be 
commended for pushing us in the right 
direction.
Whats next, hall passes?
Mandatory standardized testing for universities would insult higher education
A decent mechanic would never pre
sume to know everything about your 
cars engine by checking the oil. A decent 
doctor would never draw a conclusion 
about your general health by taking your 
blood pressure.
But somehow, the Commision on the 
Future of Higher Education is deciding 
whether mandating standardized tests 
at the university level will prove that 
students are learning and ensure that 
they will be able to do America proud 
after college.
Presuming to quantify students learn
ing with a standardized test is an insult 
to the spirit of academia. Especially at 
a university as intellectually diverse and 
outstanding as Carnegie Mellon, what 
could standardized testing possibly re
veal? That computer science majors are 
clueless when it comes to the Stanislavski 
method? That creative writers cant engi
neer software? What a shock.
President Bush trying to reform higher 
education is like Bill Clinton writing a 
sexual ethics policy, or William Howard 
Taft publishing a diet book. Even if its
good advice, consider the source.
Although public institutions like the 
University of Pittsburgh will be most 
vulnerable to such tests, private colleges 
are not untouchable. They receive public 
funding and would be susceptible to the 
same leverage as public institutions, such 
as accreditation by groups authorized by 
the federal government.
The commissions chairman has 
claimed that such tests would provide 
a standard format by which higher 
education could be held accountable 
and would also allow for colleges and 
universities to be compared more eas
ily. Margaret Spellings, Bushs secretary 
of education, thinks that prospective 
students need this extra information in 
order to choose a university. Considering 
the extensive research most students 
conduct when searching for the right 
college  consulting the College Board 
and Princeton Review, visiting cam
puses, scheduling interviews  it seems 
the Bush administration is the only unin
formed party.
Robert x Zemsky, a member of the
federal commission and professor at the 
University of Pennsylvania, was quoted 
in The New York Times as saying that 
higher education is about to learn ... 
that they cant play the trust me game 
anymore.
Thats an awfully hypocritical claim 
from an administration that has asked 
for its constituents unequivocal trust 
on issues such as shoddy foreign intel
ligence, state-sanctioned torture, and 
unlawful wire-tapping.
The Bush administration has always 
taken a sickeningly commercial atti
tude toward education. Like No Child 
Left Behind, the imposition of manda
tory standardized tests on colleges and 
universities would only underscore the 
administrations emphasis on superficial 
results, not the rich uniqueness of the 
process. College students are not com
modities, and we should not tolerate 
being treated afs such. The learning that 
takes place in college is not like the gen
eral instruction of high school. Its far 
too specialized to be filled into a lettered 
bubble with a number-two pencil.
Justice finally in sight 
after three painful years
Christian D'Andrea
Three years ago today, over 400 peo
ple were trapped in a raging fire in a 
Rhode Island nightclub. The Station, 
a small club in the mill town of West 
Warwick, was packed with mostly 
middle-aged 80s rock fans when the 
blaze started, ignited by the pyrotech
nics of the band Great White. Sparks 
spread up the cheap and horrifically 
combustible foam soundproofing that 
lined the walls of the club and engulfed 
the whole building in less than three 
minutes.
Exactly 100 people died as a result, 
and over 200 more were injured.
Like any tragedy, the fire created a 
storm of pain and confusion that will 
stain the state of Rhode Island for years 
to come. It has devastated a community 
and bankrupted a town already stuck 
in a rapid decline. In such a close-knit 
community, nearly everyone in the state 
was connected to someone in that fire. 
However, outside of Rhode Island the 
events have been swept out of the me
dia spotlight, and seemingly forgotten 
outside the northeast.
The fire itself was immediately 
dismissed as tragic but unimportant in 
the eyes of both the U.S. government 
and the media. Despite having issued 
a state of emergency in neighboring 
Worcester, Massachusetts upon the 
deaths of six firemen in a warehouse 
blaze in 1999, the government refused 
to do the same for West Warwick. As a 
result, millions of dollars of needed aid 
never made it to Rhode Island, forcing 
both the town and its victims into mas
sive debt in their attempts to recover 
from the blaze.
Just as the government dismissed the 
tragedy, so did the national media. In 
the days following the fire, it was im
possible to find coverage of the blaze 
in outlets outside New England. It was 
clear that no one wanted to deal with 
the situation except those who were 
connected to it.
There are several causes for this ig
norance. The people trapped in the fire 
that night were anything but glamorous.
They were generally middle-aged wage 
workers  tattoo artists, sales clerks, 
waitresses, and even former strippers. 
The only victim most media outlets 
found interesting enough to focus on 
was Great White guitarist iy Longley, 
who perished in the blaze.
Another reason for the lack of atten
tion to this tragedy is its setting. The 
Station was a tiny club for washedup bands in a place most of America 
couldnt find on a map. With nothing 
immediately relatable to the general 
public, most of the national media 
simply gave up rather than dig deeper. 
Only a search of the archives of lo
cal news in New England can uncover 
the true stories of what happened that 
night, and the brave tales of recovery 
that the whole state had to collectively 
undergo.
Though much of America has 
forgotten about what happened that 
night, the pain has yet to subside in 
Rhode Island. It has taken nearly the 
three years since the fire to bring those 
who are responsible to trial. However, 
the recent events in the courts offer the 
hope of closure to some of the victims 
and their families.
Three men were charged with over 
200 counts of involuntary manslaugh
ter apiece for their negligence: club 
owners Michael and Jeffery Derderian 
and Great Whites tour manager Daniel 
Biechele. Though these charges were 
levied in late 2003, their trials were 
pushed back to 2006 as lawyers on each 
side weighed their cases. However, the 
first steps toward justice came early, 
when on February 7 this year, Biechele 
took responsibility and pleaded guilty 
to avoid going to trial. Though this en
sures that Biechele will serve jail time, 
his plea also ensures that he will serve 
no more than 10 years in prison  a 
sentence far too light for actions that 
killed 100 people.
Though Biechele is not completely 
responsible for the deaths that night, he 
should take the brunt of the blame for 
the events. This was not the only concert 
where he set off fireworks in a venue 
that did not give him permission; at 
least three other places have confirmed 
that they were unaware that the band

Editorial pooly portrays Senate
This letter does not represent the 
views of Senate as a whole. Similarly, 
last weeks editorial, Student Senate 
poorly represents constituents, does 
very little to accurately represent Senate 
as a whole, choosing instead to rely on 
blanket generalizations and inflamma
tory language.
While there are certainly some valid 
criticisms in the piece, particularly re
garding abstentions and outreach, I am 
disappointed at the extent to which 
things were exaggerated. Senators that 
may have had a conflicting obligation 
didnt bother to show up, and any ab
stention, even valid, was called lazy. 
The allegation that the whole Senate 
failed to uncover ... dangerous bag
gage in a policy that was the purview 
of a specific committee is simply ridicu
lous. This last point is akin to me criti
cizing a Pillbox staffer for not knowing 
the particular wording of a News story.
As a Senator, I often hear or read 
this type of criticism, but in all cases 
it is those who are infrequent visitors 
to Senate  likely only attending one 
meeting  that are leveling it. The 
statements in the editorial suggest that 
it too is afflicted by the tendency of the 
campus community to criticize and gen
eralize based on the contents of one or
two meetings, or on individual actions.
Anyone who had come to the few 
meetings before the one in question 
would have been aware of the ongo
ing discussion of the Students Rights 
Policy, which started sometime before 
winter break. They would have also 
been aware of the active recruitment 
efforts by several members of Senate, 
resulting in two promising H&SS can
didates. Furthermore, they would be 
aware of the ongoing efforts to con
tact constituents about issues and solicit 
feedback.
I encourage people, especially those 
who intend to write about Senate, to 
become more involved or at least at
tend more frequently. I hope that they 
will then witness for themselves the 
questioning, thoughtful discussion, 
and lack of abstentions that normally 
characterize Senate and be able to pres
ent a more accurate portrayal.
Gaining a familiarity with Senate 
will allow fairer and more constructive 
criticisms in the future, which will allow 
Senate to move forward with its efforts 
to serve the student body.

New Pennsylvania bill demonizes homosexuality
1S QhQ\A/n \Shawn Wertz
We see them on television, in 
movies, and even in magazines: 
pictures of polished and upstand
ing men and women who stand 
out for the simple fact that they 
are gay.
Society has come to love them 
 some of them, at least. After 
all,-, where would we be without 
Wills vivacious friend Jack?
But how many still feel 
comfortable when the attractive 
veneer is erased and the true 
hun^ans are exposed? How can 
the,homosexual individual, relegqjed to a figure of amusement 
by television and movie specta
tors, become a human being of 
substance and respect if society 
wont allow him or her to perform 
certain vital human functions?
Irecently came across a 
bill-, that was introduced by 
Pennsylvania legislators advocat
ing the absolute protection of the 
foundations upon which mar
riage was built. The Pennsylvania 
Marriage Protection Amendment 
claims to sanctify the institution 
of traditional marriage, par
ticularly by limiting its possible 
definitions.
Pennsylvania for Marriage, 
a fundamentalist group from 
Harrisburg, is responsible for in
troducing the bill into legislature. 
The groups life goal is to make 
sure same-sex marriage is not 
recognized in Pennsylvania. 
Furthermore, they contest any 
possibility of a marriage equiva
lent, such as civil union.
I applaud any organizations 
attempts to advocate what it be
lieves is important. However, I 
cannot and will not willingly ac
knowledge this groups attempts 
when the price is the degrada
tion of others  all in the name 
of moral protection.
Are we destroying society by 
allowing individuals to make the
ultimate commitment to each 
other? If that is the case, are 
we doing society a good deed 
by expecting members who are 
different in a particular way 
to live in the shadows, denied 
the privileges that a reasonable 
human would expect? These 
ideas should not take root in a 
society founded on democratic 
principles.
The organization contends that 
marriage, a fundamental building 
block of society, would be utterly 
destroyed if even an equivalent 
such as civil union were allowed. 
However, the group needs to do a 
lot of clarifying before this argu
ment can be acknowledged.
The group tries to substanti
ate its argument with a statistic 
explaining that Norways mar
riage rate drastically plummeted 
after same-sex marriage was al
lowed. Carelessly, it ignores the 
fact that Norway did not institute 
same-sex marriage; it instituted 
civil union, a very different in
stitution. Though marriage rates 
did fall, the fall was not drastic 
enough to directly attribute it to 
the institution of civil union in 
the country.
Not only does Pennsylvania for 
Marriage fail to draw a coherent 
corollary between the instate
ment of civil union in Norway 
and its drop in marriage rate, it 
blatantly disregards statistics of 
neighboring countries from the 
same years. The marriage rates 
in Sweden, the Netherlands, and 
Denmark, countries that sur
round Norway, increased once 
same-sex marriage or civil union 
was allowed.
I am shocked that any organi
zation would blatantly disregard 
quantitative facts and try to back 
up its religious convictions with 
so many unsubstantiated claims.
And if Pennsylvania for 
Marriage did not make its fun
damentalism clear enough, the 
group goes so far as to equate 
same-sex unions with polygamy 
and incest.
The group claims that if mar
riage laws were ambivalent 
enough to allow for same-sex 
marriage or civil union, employ
ers then might find themselves 
having to give health care ben
efits to an employees six or seven 
wives.
This claim would be darkly 
comical if it werent an actual 
argument, and I cant help but 
think back to a time when the 
same claims were made about 
interracial marriage. Marriage 
laws then werent even as welldefined as they are in most states 
today, yet did society see the pro
liferation of polygamy?
The real shame behind this 
organization is that it actually 
introduced a bill into legislature 
and substantiated its claims with 
the aforementioned arguments. 
They pleaded that same-sex mar
riage would have adverse effects
on children, confusing them and 
introducing them to immorality 
at an early age.
Perhaps I am alone in having 
problems with such a bill. Maybe 
Im just one of those poor desti
tute creatures who found his way 
to the right side of the tracks, 
currently praying for a Christian 
fundamentalist to show me the 
error of my ways!
As ludicrous as that sounds, 
what is even more ludicrous is 
that Pennsylvania for Marriage 
expects everyone to think that 
way. In essence, Pennsylvania for 
Marriage basically told everyone 
to lock your doors, hide your 
children, and guard your win
dow treatments! The Gays are 
coming!
I used to have a great deal 
of respect for the institution of 
marriage. Coming from divorced 
parents, marriage was always a
Danielle Saudino/Dossier Literary Editor
lofty goal for me. But with the 
current lobbying of organizations 
like Pennsylvania for Marriage, it 
seems to be trapped in an ivory 
tower.
Same-sex marriage would not 
destroy the traditional institu
tion. Pennsylvania for Marriage 
already destroyed it. No longer is 
marriage regarded as the biggest 
commitment two loving people 
can make. It serves only as a 
dividing line between the haves 
and have-nots.
And just in case that doesnt 
get my point across: Were here 
and were queer, so get used to 
us. And help yourself to some 
wedding cake on your way out 
the door.

Veto disrespects representatives
When personal politics enter the decision, democracy is lost
Benjamin Hackett
Help us, Mr. President... pretty 
please? We are too scared to have 
an authoritative opinion on an 
issue as important as academic 
freedom, so please remove the 
burden of representation from 
us. And in perfect unity with 
this request, the Undergraduate 
Student Senate failed to accept 
responsibility for its actions by 
lacking the political and philo
sophical insight to overturn the 
executive veto.
It is an issue of representa
tion and dereliction of duty. 
When a representative body 
puts its stamp, however weakly, 
on a non-binding resolution of 
purpose, there is no room for 
an executive usurpation of that 
bodys opinion. The reasoning 
behind the veto, or at least the 
stated justification, concerned a 
failure of representation by the 
Undergraduate Student Senate.
When one unpacks that logic, 
it fails to flesh out. This reason
ing presumes to assign levels of 
representation inappropriately
to branches of government. 
Understandably, political con
stancy and philosophy is not 
considered, nor intellectually ap
proachable, by some parties.
To veto non-binding legisla
tion is to say that I am more 
representative than they are. 
The statement translates into 
the simple claim that one officer, 
elected without a majority of 
student support, is sufficiently 
more representative than a body 
of similarly elected membership 
drawn from every college on the 
Carnegie Mellon campus.
Additionally perplexing is the 
failure of a representative body 
to divorce a concept from its ori
gins. There are an immeasurable 
number of things in use every day 
that have been attained from less 
than amicable research sources. 
The idea that these things should 
be discarded, or ignored during 
debate, is reprehensible.
A governing body that can
not evaluate based on the merits 
of a policy alone should be dis
banded for the good of those it is 
supposed to serve.
Perhaps the most telling result 
from the entire endeavor was the 
willingness of a representative
branch of government to let 
personal politics interfere with 
an issue as basic as academic 
freedom. This same willingness 
allowed one authoritatively flac
cid branch of government to fall 
victim to the situational politics 
of an executive branch, a branch 
similarly void of any semblance 
of valor.
The months will pass and an
other opportunity to debate po
litical philosophy on the floors 
of a governing body will be lost. 
The moments of clarity, once ac
cessible if they had only been 
addressed, will fall through 
the cracks of the calendar and 
fully out of the organizations 
memory.
For any organization, the time 
comes when no backdoor bail
out can help it save face with 
the electorate. The latest trend 
towards governance by personal

Negligence to blame 
for nightclub inferno
FIRE, from A10
would use fireworks in its show.
However, the use of fireworks 
in the Station was extremely 
negligent  his fireworks shot 
off an eight-foot plume in a club 
where the ceilings were, at most, 
approximately nine feet high. 
Common sense should have told 
him that something bad was 
bound to happen.
Biecheles sentencing, sched
uled for May 8, will have a major 
effect on how the trial against 
the Derderians is run. The two 
currently share the blame for the 
fire. Even though Biechele was 
responsible for the use of fire
works, the Derderians lined their 
club with cheap and extremely 
flammable foam soundproof
ing, which allowed the flames 
to spread in a rapid and deadly 
manner.
Though the Derderians obvi
ously share some of the blame, 
they had no idea what was in 
store when Great White began 
to play that night. They never 
cleared the use of fireworks in 
their club, and though the fire 
hazards were still apparent,
Biecheles recklessness and neg
ligence essentially guaranteed 
that the club would go up in 
flames.
The Derderian brothers are 
clearly to blame for the over
crowding of their club and vi
olations of the fire codes, but 
the tragedy was not inevitable. 
Biecheles use of unauthorized 
fireworks was the catalyst be
hind everything that happened 
that night.
The fact that Biechele will 
serve no more than 10 years 
in jail for sparking the fire that 
killed 100 people and ruined the 
lives of many others is a joke. 
We can only hope that the fami
lies of those who had their lives 
so drastically changed one night 
three years ago can take solace 
in the fact that, at the very least, 
someone has stepped up to take 
blame.
Christian DAndrea (ckd@) is a 
Rhode Islander who grew up just a 
few miles from the Station. He lost 
a cousin in the Station fire three 
years ago, and he will never for
get the images and events of that 
tragic night.

Tom Sabram
This past week Senate failed to 
override the veto of the Students 
Rights Policy Resolution with 
a vote of 5-17-5, and it looks 
like the process may finally be 
at rest. I would like to encourage 
all Student Senators to return 
to their hard-working efforts 
from last semester. I would also 
like to encourage students who 
were disheartened with their 
representation to either become 
members-at-large or petition to 
fill a vacancy if your college has 
one, or at least talk with some of 
your Senators. Now I can move 
back to the tasks at hand.
As I have mentioned in earlier 
columns, I am a member of the 
Dean of Student Affairs Search 
Committee. The committee will 
be finishing up its work relatively 
soon, and from what I have been 
told the candidates will be visit
ing campus soon, providing an 
opportunity for the candidates 
to interact with the student 
population. It is important for 
students to have the chance to 
talk with the incoming poten
tial deans of Student Affairs, and 
if you have opinions feel free 
to let me know your feelings. 
I will continue to update you 
on this issue. This is an exciting 
opportunity for this campus and 
will help direct some of the at
titudes of the campus for at least 
the upcoming decade. However, 
this isnt the only new and in
teresting opportunity coming to 
campus.
I spent the beginning part of 
this semester on the Panhellenic 
expansion committee to assist in 
bringing a new national sorority 
to campus.
After spending' several hours 
in presentations about the 
history and programming of 
the organizations vying to join 
the Carnegie Mellon Greek 
community, both the women of 
Zeta Psi Sigma and the expar> 
sion committee discussed who 
would be the best fit for Zeta and 
the campus community. After a 
thoughtful and considerate dis
cussion by the expansion com
mittee (I cant speak to Zetas 
discussion, since that was their 
private matter), both groups 
chose to invite Alpha Chi Omega 
to Canegie Mellon, making it the 
schools fifth national Panhellenic 
sorority.
I would like to wish the women 
of Zeta Psi Sigma the bfest as 
they embark upon the charter
ing process, and I hope that the 
remainder of the campus will do 
the same. With these two major 
events happening on campus this 
semester, some type of change is 
imminent. I am sure these events 
will help to improve campus life 
and make Carnegie Mellon even 
better.

Pitt student dies in alcohol incident
ate healthy habits around their 
own relationship with alcohol, 
Church said. But she admitted 
there is a lot more that Carnegie 
Mellon and campuses across the 
country can do to promote alco
hol awareness.
As far as national concerns, we 
probably skew a bit lower than 
normal, Church added about al
cohol consumption, but the real
ity is that we need to find the right 
combination of education, expe
riences, and opportunities thats 
going to speak to our population 
[of students]
Overall, Church urged students 
to follow protocol and call the 
police when someone is in danger, 
even if off campus.
We want to make sure students 
know that if theyre in a situation 
that someone is at risk, not to 
worry about getting in trouble, 
Church said.

County medical examiners office 
ruled that Holly died from blunt 
force trauma to the head. The 
death was ruled accidental.
Medics on the scene declared 
him dead at 12:30, according to 
Ewing.
What happened to the student 
at Pitt is really a tragedy, said 
Jennifer Church, associate dean 
of Student Affairs at CMU. Even 
though it was off campus, and 
entirely a different issue, it says 
a lot about drinking in college in 
general.
The incident shows the adverse 
effects alcohol can have on in
dividuals, including college stu
dents at Carnegie Mellon.
Alcohol consumption is defi
nitely a concern for us, Church 
said. We worry about overcon
sumption and about consumption
by first-time users.
Churchs department is respon
sible for initiating alcohol preven
tion and awareness programs like 
AlcoholEdu and Late Night activi
ties at the University Center.
AlcoholEdu is currently in its 
second year of operation at CMU, 
with the class of 2008 being the 
first class to take it.
The course is designed to cre
ate awareness among college stu
dents about the effects of alcohol 
and the problems with unhealthy 
consumption.
AlcoholEdu for us is really 
intended to be a piece of a larger 
solution. Its really a launching 
point to ensure that students 
are getting the information, 
Church said.
She stressed that the final deci
sion of whether to consume alco
hol or not is with each individual.

THE TARTAN  FEBRUARY 20, 2006
06NE64 :63N_55m 5E6NE5 5oNH4v 5m65_4
LACROSSE, from A14
we couldnt get the ball out of our 
own defensive zone, so we rarely 
had the opportunity to score. We 
are going to have to put some se
rious work into our faceoffs and 
defensive play.
The teams strength lies in 
its depth and raw talent. With 
21 players on the roster, the ma
jority of them upperclassmen, 
the Tartans have a real chance 
to make an impact within their 
division. It is Stamatopoulos 
goal within the coming weeks 
to develop that raw talent into 
a team. Typically teams, when 
they join the MDIA, have a very 
difficult time adjusting and arent 
successful, he said. However, 
I dont perceive that to be the 
case for this team. The CCLA 
is probably the toughest conference in the country on the B side. 
However, we have lofty goals. 
My immediate goal for the team 
is to get them to play together as 
a unit. We need to transition to a 
point where we arent thinking, 
we are just reacting. Last season 
. I coached a playoff team in the 
CCLA; we are a lot better than 
that team. Making a deep run in 
the playoffs and being a top-25 
team is definitely an option for 
this team. Going to Dallas and 
the national tournament is not 
out of the question either.
The Tartans first divisional 
home game is Wednesday, March
22, against Indiana University 
of Pennsylvania at 7 pm in 
Gesling Stadium. Hopefully, 
temperatures will be at least 30 
degrees; warmer conditions will 
be more spectator-friendly. As 
Stamatopoulos said, The goal
for Carnegie Mellon lacrosse is to 
build an organization that is both 
successful on and off the field. 
Our philosophy here is to do what 
it takes to compete at the highest 
possible level and represent the 
University well. We not only want 
to create a national powerhouse, 
we want to create something spe
cial on campus too.
Carnegie Mellons mens la
crosse team is looking to create 
that buzz and excitement sur
rounding athletics that is often 
missing from the Carnegie Mellon 
community. So this spring, help 
the Tartans achieve this goal by 
taking an hour and a half out of 
your studies, donning a Carnegie 
Mellon T-shirt, and heading over 
to Gesling Stadium to lend your 
support to the men of Carnegie 
Mellon lacrosse.

a career-high nine points versus 
the Spartans.
Yesterday, a Rothwell layup 
off a pass from Sommermeyer 
brought the Tartans within one 
point at 20-19 at the 8:24 mark, 
but then Case ended the half with 
a 20^4 run to take a 40-23 lead. 
Feola caught fire in the second 
half for the Tartans, erupting for 
17 of her 24 points, en route to 
Cutting the deficit from 17 to 11
when the final buzzer sounded.
The womens basketball 
team will cap their season on 
Saturday, February 25, at 2 
pm in Skibo Gymnasium when 
they take on the University of 
Rochester. They will need to 
defeat the Yellowjackets to avoid 
going winless in UAA play. The 
UAA is one of the premier con
ferences in womens Division III 
basketball; they currently have 
four schools ranked in the USA 
Today Division III Coaches Poll,
including Washington University 
in St. Louis, which leads the way 
at number three. Dont take pity 
on the Tartans, however  they 
consider playing strong UAA 
competition as a challenge and 
a great opportunity. Its excit
ing because you know youre in 
the best conference in Division 
III, said head coach Gerri Seidl. 
Every game is going to be a dog
fight. We have to come ready to 
play game in and game out.
Track prepares for UAA Championships
TRACK, from A14
from junior Russel Verbofsky, 
placing fifth overall in the 300- 
meter dash. Complementing 
these performances, the Tartans 
secured third place in five run
ning heats: sophomore Shauna 
Ormon (44.84) and freshman 
CarltonReeves (50.86) inthe300- 
meter dash, junior Davey Quinn 
(2:31.36) in the 1000-meter run, 
and the 4x400 relay teams with a 
time of 3:21.15 for the men and 
4:19.08 for the women.
With impressive finishes for 
Carnegie Mellon on the track, 
the Tartans also fared well in 
the field events. Junior Eric 
Tang earned a second-place fin
ish in the mens long jump with 
a 6.34-meter jump. Tang also 
placed 11th in the triple jump 
with first-year Colin Marks finish
ing eighth with a jump of 12.86 
meters. First-year Jessica Meng 
of the womens team garnered 
an impressive fourth overall per
formance in triple jump with a 
10.74-meter finish.
Mens throwers Tom Matta 
and Michael Reggie finished in 
the top 20 in the weight throw
ing events, with Mattas score 
of 16.24 meters coming in ninth 
overall and Reggies 13.85 
meters coming in 20th. Matta 
also secured 28th overall in his 
13.41-meter performance in the
very good performances, 
remarked head coach Dario 
Donatelli after the meet. I would 
say we would have a chance to 
win the UAA championship. It 
would depend on everyone on 
the team to do a little bit better 
than they are doing now, but we 
are all doing as well as we are

shot put. Adriane Soehner and 
Becky Metier also performed well 
in the womens throwing events, 
with Soehner coming in 39th 
and 37th overall, respectively, in 
the shot put (9.31m) and weight 
throw (10.84m) eve'nts. Metier 
placed 24th overall in shot put 
(10.84m) and 27th in weight 
throw (12.16m).
We definitely have had some
in the past year where we came 
up second. We definitely have a 
chance to win it.
With solid performances 
from both the womens and 
mens teams at the Kent State 
Tune-Up, the Tartans are looking 
forward to competing in the UAA 
Championships at Chicago in two 
weeks and should look to place 
highly overall.

Fate of University Athletic Association top honors lies in the Tartans final game
Track tunes up at Kent
by Jeffrey Wang
Junior Staffwriter
The CMU mens and womens 
track and field teams traveled 
to Kent State University last 
Saturday, to attend the Kent State 
Tune-Up. This meet had an open 
format, where none of the perfor
mances were scored. It was held 
primarily to prepare athletes for 
upcoming division champion
ships. More specifically for the 
Tartans, Kent prepared both the 
men and women for the UAA 
Championships at the University 
of Chicago on March 2.
Coming off a very impres
sive performance at the Oberlin 
Invitational (with a first-place 
finish for the men and third for 
the women), the Tartans were 
determined to continue their suc
cess in preparation for the UAA 
Championships. The Tartans
were able to place highly in a 
number of running events, with 
first-place heat finishes in the 
600-meter race leading the way. 
Junior Mark Davis and sopho
more Scott Fortune completed 
the 600-meter with impressive 
times of 1:24.46 and 1:25.91 to 
place sixth and seventh over
all, respectively, in the mens 
division.
Sophomore Ashley Bakelmun 
pulled off her own first-place 
heat finish to rank second over
all with a stunning performance 
of 1:43.00 in the 600-meter 
womens event. The women also 
racked up another first-place 
heat coming from an 18:58.38 
performance by KJ Helmstetter 
in the 5000-meter run, placing 
17th overall. The men added to 
their first-place finishes with a 
second-place heat time of 36.85

Swim team 
places well 
at Kenyon
by Erin Gagnon
Sports Editor
The Carnegie Mellon womens 
and mens swimming teams 
raced at the Kenyon College 
Invitational Saturday, finishing 
second and fifth, respectively.
The womens team, with 
292 points, secured second over
all out of eight teams, falling 
behind Kenyon Colleges firstplace, 419-point finish. Denison 
University rounded out the mix, 
finishing in third place overall 
with 267 points. Contributing to 
the womens overall score was 
sophomore Anna Kochalkos 
first-place finish in the 400-yard 
IM with a time of 4:42.43. Later 
in the afternoon, Kochalko fin
ished second in the 200-yard 
breaststroke with a time of 
2:30.54. Third-place honors 
were secured by junior Megan 
Yee in the 100-yard butterfly 
with a time of 1:04.51 and by 
first-year Ana Flores in the 200- 
yard backstroke with a time of 
2:23.30.
The Carnegie Mellon mens 
swimming team was not as 
successful as its womens coun
terpart this weekend. They 
finished with 89 points, good 
enough for fifth out of 10 teams. 
Denison University took home 
the overall win with 348 points, 
followed by Kenyon College 
(199), Wabash College (157), 
and Ohio Northern University 
(100). Senior Brian Hunter 
brought home the mens only 
individual first-place finish in 
the 200-yard freestyle with a 
time of 1:43.43.
and from the halftime score it 
seemed they would finally get 
that elusive win.
But the opening three min
utes of the second half would 
prove costly for the Tartans. Nate 
Maurer, the teams top scorer 
(18.3 points per game), fouled 
out of the game with 17:37 left in 
the second half after quickly pick
ing up his third, fourth, and fifth 
(a technical) fouls. The Tartans 
were up 47-38 when Maurer 
fouled out, and with the Tartans 
top scorer out of the game, Emory 
quickly took advantage. The 
Eagles went on a 20-6 run and 
led 58-53 with 9:59 left to play. 
The Eagles held on and never 
looked back as they extended 
their lead and beat the Tartans by 
14 points.
The loss at Emory meant that 
a victory yesterday against Case 
Western was crucial for the 
Tartans in order to keep their 
hopes of a UAA title alive. The two 
teams fought evenly in the first 
half, with neither team achieving 
a lead of more than five points.
After fouling out early in the 
second half against Emory on 
Friday, Maurer looked to redeem 
himself and came out firing, scor
ing 16 of his game-high 30 points 
in the first half to help the Tartans 
take a 42-37 lead going into halftime.

A temperature in the teens, 
strong gusty winds, and a dust
ing of snow on the turf may not 
sound like reasonable conditions 
for a Carnegie Mellon mens la
crosse game, but play they did, 
and win they, did, leaving Penn 
State-Behrend a long bus ride 
home to thaw out and lament a 
fruitless trip to Pittsburgh.
Carnegie Mellon mens lacrosse 
opened their season Saturday 
afternoon with a 9-7 win in a 
scrimmage against Penn StateBehrend, a win that was integral 
for the team to see where they 
are and what they need to do in 
order to prepare for their upcom
ing league play.
The Carnegie Mellon mens la
crosse team has gone through 
a complete transformation dur
ing the past year, switching from 
the National Collegiate Lacrosse 
League into the more competitive 
Mens Division of Intercollegiate 
Associates (MDIA). The MDIA is 
a league strictly for universities 
without a varsity program but 
with players who want to play 
varsity-caliber lacrosse. Teams 
within the MDIA practice five 
times a week and are mostly 
funded at a varsity level. The 
MDIA consists of 170 teams in 
nine conferences that span the 
country. Carnegie Mellon falls 
within the Central Collegiate 
Lacrosse Association (CCLA) of 
the MDIA. The Tartans new divi
sion is home to colleges such as 
the University of Dayton, Grove
City College, Indiana University 
of Pennsylvania, and Taylor 
University.
This years addition of head 
coach Anthony Stamatopoulos 
adds the experience and guid
ance the team needs in order to 
successfully navigate their way 
around the CCLA. Stamatopoulos 
is a native of Baltimore who 
played for and coached for Ferris 
State University, another CCLA 
program. Assistant coach Rich 
Grant was an outstanding la
crosse player for the University of 
Pittsburgh and is able to extend 
his passion and skill to Carnegie 
Mellons program.
The increased practice time 
paid off Saturday afternoon as 
the Tartans were able to play with 
high intensity throughout the 60- 
minute game, racking up nine
goals. Sophomore captain Matt 
Adams led the team with four 
goals and an assist, while junior 
captain Rick McMullen added 
to Adams four goals with two 
of his own. The remaining three
goals were scored by senior Troy 
Cox and sophomores Devin Blais 
and Zach Teeple. Adams, Blais, 
Teeple, and Cox each had an assist 
to round out the Tartans offen
sive. Unfortunately, Penn StateBehrend countered Carnegie 
Mellons attack with an attack of 
its own. Going into halftime, the 
score was even at four apiece as 
the lead transfered between the 
two teams throughout the game.
McMullen commented, When 
we had the ball on offense we 
were able to play well and score, 
but we couldnt win faceoffs, and

No comment. That was all 
junior Brad Matta had to say 
about the mens basketball teams 
disappointing 88-74 loss against 
Emory in Atlanta last Friday.
The Tartans entered the night 
in sole possession of the UAA lead 
and were looking to pull ahead of 
the rest of the conference with a 
little over a week left in the regu
lar season.
Carnegie Mellon defeated 
Emory 96-88 back on January 
22 at Skibo Gymnasium, and the 
first half of Fridays game looked 
as though the end result would 
be the same. The two teams 
exchanged leads several times at 
the beginning of the game until 
the Tartans went up 17-16 on a 
layup by Clayton Barlow-Wilcox. 
The Tartans held the lead for the 
rest of the first half, extending it 
to as much as 11 points. The first 
half was highlighted by dunks 
from seniors Nate Maurer and 
Bary Dunn, as well as the sharp 
shooting of senior and co-captain 
A.J. Straub, who hit four con
secutive three-pointers, including 
three in a one-minute span. The 
Tartans went into the half leading 
Emory 45-36. The Tartan seniors 
had yet to beat Emory in Atlanta,

The Tartans never relinquished 
their lead durihg the second half, 
despite going 0-8 from the freethrow line in the last 19 minutes 
of the game. Fortunately, Maurer 
and Brad Matta hit clutch free 
throws with 35 seconds left to 
help seal an 80-75 victory for the 
Tartans.
Maurer explained how Fridays 
loss was motivation for him 
against Case. Personally, I let 
down the team and the fans. 
Being a senior, I shouldnt have to 
watch the last 17 minutes of the 
game from the bench, so I knew I 
had to step up big today.
With the win, the Tartans 
are now tied for the UAA lead 
with Washington University. The 
Tartans can clinch the title with a 
win at home this Saturday against 
Rochester. Said Maurer about the 
Rochester game, Everything is 
on the line just like last year. 
Hopefully we can clinch the title 
for our school and everybody. Ive 
wanted to make the tournament 
ever since I started playing college 
basketball, and now I have one 
more game to make that happen.

5-7) took a 39-19 halftime lead 
and picked up where they left 
off to gradually increase their 
lead, winning by 41 points. The 
Tartans again fell behind early 
yesterday, but they buckled down 
and played hard to outscore Case 
38-32 in the second half before 
losing by 11.
Sophomore Leah Feola became 
the first Tartan to score over 20 
points in a game this season as 
she got a career-high 24 points 
on 10-15 shooting against Case 
Western (12-12, 5-8). First-year 
forward Ashley Rothwell came 
off the bench to score a careerhigh 12 points in both games, 
while also collecting a career-high 
12 rebounds against Case. Senior 
Dava Sommermeyer added nine 
points and five rebounds in the 
loss to Emory, while first-year 
guard Corey Innes contributed

YOU ON THE CELL PHONE! Shut up!
Polite cell phones may relieve your ears
Since it first burst onto the hip couture 
scene, the cellular telephone, or cell phone," 
or the minimalists cell, has both driven 
communication advancements and provoked 
a wide gamut of controversy. The problem, my 
friends, lies not in potential brain tumors and 
avoidable car accidents, but in the awkward 
social situations cell phones can induce. Until 
these predicaments are resolved, friendships will 
continue to be lost and countless embarrassed 
people will still squirm around in their seats.
But researchers at Carnegie Mellon are curbing 
the wave of humiliation that comes with a 
quiet calculus lecture, 26 attentive students, 
and one sudden burst of a CRAAAAZY 
LAAAAADIESSSS" ringtone. Enter the eWatch, 
a device capable of telling the time  and much 
more!
Carnegie Mellon researchers are in the early 
stages of creating the eWatch, a wrist-clock 
with enough tricks to make any Rolex-toting 
executive salivate like Pavlovs dog. Project 
advisor Asim Smailagic leads the effort, which 
is a collaboration between the ECE department, 
CS department, and industrial design. First 
tested in August 2004 and publicized on National 
Public Radio last week, the eWatch can not only 
tell you if you're late for that 3 oclock dentist 
appointment, itll remind you that its scheduled 
for that day. And lets say you're late for that 
appointment and you're running really fast and 
BAM! you collide with a car  never fear! The 
eWatch has akeady notified the authorities of the 
accident. So it saves lives. Its a TV remote, too.
The eWatch and your cellphone are on the same 
team. They work together, and they never fight 
about the rules. The eWatch is like the coach 
with a headset on the sidelines, surveying the 
whole field. The eWatch can detect if you are 
in a darkened room, such as a photo lab, movie 
theater, or one of those weird places where the 
sun never rises.
Taking this information, the eWatch signals your 
cell phone not to ring. This gets a little more 
complicated than Steve Martin telling you to 
turn off your cell phone before you sit down for
Nanny McPhee. The eWatch even detects where 
you are based on audio levels and ambient light, 
letting your cell phone know if you are in the 
confessional or just listening to "CRAAAAZY 
LAAAAADIESSSS.
This eWatch is going to be big news for the 
geriatric scene. Theyve been hatin' on the cell 
phone since it was the size of a briefcase and 
could only fit in the trunk of a car. Cell phone use 
has increased 10-fold in the last 10 years, a fact 
best verified by spending 15 minutes in line at 
Giant Eagle. Brain cancer is on the rise, too, but 
that's a minor detail.
Who hasnt longed for the days of yore 
when candlelight and sticks made for good 
entertainment, when a friendly movie was 
interrupted not by Beyonce but by the mooing of 
cows out in the pasture?
So if youre sitting in a movie and your second 
cousin just has to tell you all about last nights 
junior prom, the eWatch will tell you nearly 
everything but the color of her dress. The 
device signals to the user with visual or tactile 
messages. Important e-mails and voice messages 
can be shown in the same way.
Perfect, right? For the gadget-forward, yes. The 
fashion-forward? Eh, not so much. Though its 
offered in various colors (an oatmeal beige and 
a blinding blue, among others), the eWatch fits 
like wearing a stack of Pogs on your wrist drawn 
together by a thin strip of velcro. The website 
photos showing the eWatch without the plastic 
covering looks like what youd expect from the 
most complicated time-keep that doesnt chime
 a mini circuit board.
Can we expect to see Angelina Jolie sporting 
an eWatch on the way to her next yoga session? 
Your guess is as good as my sweet Joy to 
the World ringtone  still not changed since 
Christmas 2004. How nice now that I dont have 
to share the Good News with the rest of the 
darkened theater.

Lee Gregg, a Carnegie Tech professor of

apropos that Gregg was later memorialized in the

X-treme fashion, X-treme time commitment
Lunar Gala designers and choreographers prep for the big show
Lunar Gala is the opportunity to celebrate cultural 
awareness, creativity through expression, and appreciation 
for fashion and design, said junior design major Natisha 
Kang, Lunar Gala's 2006 design coordinator.
Ten years ago, Lunar Gala began as an event to celebrate 
the lunar new year. It is a fashion show that features the 
innovative designs of both Carnegie Mellon University 
students and local boutiques, as modeled by Carnegie Mellon 
students.
Every year the Lunar Gala committee, which is led by 
two producers, strives to choose a flexible theme that can 
be interpreted by the various designers. This year, the 
committee chose the theme X in honor of Lunar Galas 
10-year anniversary. Co-producer David Kim, a senior ECE 
and business double major, said, We wanted the X to 
represent eXtreme, or any words with the same idea, such 
as 'expression.'
In mid-October, nearly 20 designers submitted their portfolios 
to be evaluated by the committee. Each portfolio contained 
eight to ten designs for both guys and girls. Kim said, The 
committee was looking for a designer or pair of designers who 
knew exactly what materials they would be using and knew 
how to directly replicate their sketches." With this criterion 
as the basis, the interview process helped narrow down the 
nearly 20 applicants to 10.
Katie Rodgers, a sophomore industrial design major, was 
one of the 10 chosen. Her theme is eXtreme Compost" 
and features designs integrating both fabric and everyday 
materials, such as newspaper. "Ive always wanted to [create] 
things out of random things laying around, Rodgers said.
While Lunar Gala encourages these sorts of creative ideas, 
there is a limit to the flexibility: time and money. Certain 
materials would take too much time to obtain, and the costs 
of these materials come directly out of the designers' pockets. 
Kim mentioned that a few of the designers receive SURG 
funding.
In mid-November, the designers met with 30 to 40 models in 
order to see them walk down the mock runway. The designers 
listed their top three choices for models per design, and it 
was the committees job to distribute the models to all the 
designers. Rodgers said, I picked certain models for certain 
outfits that I knew they would look good in. As soon as all the 
different designer-model sections were decided, the real work 
began.
The designers had all of winter break to collect materials and 
create the designs. "Anything past winter break was just 
tweaking and fitting," Kim said.
Along with designing and creating the actual clothes, the 
designers must have an idea of how they want the models to 
move across the runway. They are able to choose their own 
music and receive help with choreography and positioning 
from the backstage coordinators, senior Hannah Kim and 
junior Katy Lin. Rodgers chose Kiss Kiss by Tarkan, which 
is a Turkish song with a simple beat. "I just chose a simple 
choreography because I think the show is more about the 
clothes," Rodgers said.
A designer partnership, first-year Gavin Stewart and 
sophomore Joannie Wu, chose industrial music to go with 
their Slavic-, wartime-, 20s-, and cyber-themed collection. I 
like that the song starts out slow but really begins to pick up 
as the section progresses," said Stewart.
After winter break, the Lunar Gala committee met twice a 
week; the week before the show, they will meet every day in 
order to run through each of the designers sections and finetune any choreography and poses. For each designer, practice 
lasts for about 10 to 15 minutes. "Fitting and adjusting take 
the most time, Rodgers said.
There is a reason why the designers are given five months to 
prepare for the show  every last second is needed. Outside
- of practice, designers continue to work on their pieces.
They meet with their partners and their models to alter and 
enhance. Rodgers said, "[It] consumes a lot of my out-of-class
time. Stewart agreed, My partner and I met twice a week 
and often spent entire weekends working on our designs. 
While being a huge time commitment, designing for Lunar 
Gala has also served as an extensive learning experience.
Ive learned a lot about sewing, pattern making, and fitting," 
Stewart said. I plan on designing next year, so this has really 
acted as preparation for me."
Professionally, Stewart is looking into industrial design with 
an interest in shoe design, and views Lunar Gala as a big 
step in first-hand design experience. Similarly, Rodgers said, 
Since Im an industrial design major, it will look really good 
on my resume and in my portfolio."
What makes the burden of costs so bearable for the designers, 
Kim believes, is that the designers get to keep each piece 
they create for their portfolios. Also, according to Public 
Relations Chair Winnifred Tse, the designers have the option 
of showcasing their work at The Frame, an art and music 
venue on Margaret Morrison Street.
The most exciting thing about being a designer is getting 
to make your own designs come to life and showing them off 
to the school, said Rodgers. Also, its a way to get involved 
with a school activity."
Its just a good time all around. said Stewart.
Kang said, The most rewarding part of the show is when the 
hard work of almost 100 people from all over campus and from 
such diverse backgrounds, comes together to produce a show 
that is unique to Carnegie Mellon."
Lunar Gala is this Saturday at 8 pm in Rangos Hall. Tickets 
can be purchased at the Lunar Gala table or at the UC Info 
Desk. Tickets are $12 each and include food, the show, and 
entrance to the afterparty.

Look like your car
Designers weigh in about whats hot in the auto world
You have seen it all  from the box on wheels to the sleek 
cat-like form that hugs the road. These are the cars you yearn 
for or lampoon. Some cars are so hot they make you stop in 
your tracks or approach carefully when they are parked. Some 
cars inspire reverence, others mockery. But the design of a car 
goes beyond that  it not only has something to do with how 
others see you, but it can also change how you see yourself.
"Some people identify themselves by their car; some people 
dont care, said Mark Baskinger, a professor in the design 
department.
If youre a car buff and stopped by the 2006 Pittsburgh 
International Auto Show, you have already seen some of 
the newest designs from well over 30 car manufacturers, 
including luxury brands like Aston Martin and Bentley. To 
an untrained eye it may all look good to you, especially after 
long, cold waits for the bus in the morning. But what do real 
designers think of the looks of cars today?
Greg Zulkie, a sophomore industrial design major, feels that 
the Detroit Auto Show showcased the problems that the 
American manufacturers have faced lately. He stated that, 
after releasing a lot of SUVs and trucks, [Fords] sales hit 
rock bottom this year, along with GM. Both companies have 
been in damage control mode for at least a year and havent 
appeared to even consider new models that take risks.
Zulkie believes that among American, European, and 
Japanese cars, Japanese cars "are reflecting the best of two 
different markets." Zulkie notes reliability, gas mileage, and 
performance as the star points in Japanese-made vehicles.
So how do Carnegie Mellon-students stack up? How much 
car-style savvy does the Morewood parking lot, or Margaret 
Morrison Street, reflect? Baskinger said, On this campus you 
see the BMW 3 Series everywhere. Its got a high sticker price 
for what it is. But though the ticket is high, Baskinger thinks 
the car is nicely styled and ... speaks to the identity of a lot 
of our students. Zulkie agrees, saying that BMWs stand out 
among student and faculty rides.
Among the car manufacturers that Baskinger said do it 
best is Toyota. [They] squeeze as much out of the price as 
they can, but he said that Toyota is still trying to figure out 
what their cars look like. While Toyota may be floundering 
to create a distinctive style, their sedans have become 
increasingly influential, according to Baskinger. He mentioned 
that Volkswagen and Jetta have adopted the "rounded 
blobular form for their sedans, similar to the Camry or the 
Corolla. Baskinger called this trend the Camrification of the 
automobile.
A notable car dud from the past was the Chevy Nova, a real 
flop in the Spanish-speaking world where its name means 
"doesnt go. More recent failures? Baskinger picks the 
Pontiac Aztek as the big no-no in recent years. By placing the 
Aztek on a minivan platform, Baskinger said Pontiac made it 
look like "too much car. He feels that the Aztek tries to fake 
the look of a military vehicle, and the car ends up looking 
"bloated. Baskinger doesnt discriminate against militaryinspired rides  his favorite car is the Land Rover Defender 
90, which he called the simplest car ever made. Zulkie, on 
the other hand, noted the H2 and H3, inspired by the military 
Hummer vehicle, as his least favorite cars. "They represent 
the arrogance of gas consumption in America, he said.
But Carnegie Mellon and Pittsburgh are doing pretty well at 
keeping the roads tank-free, according to Baskinger. He said 
that of the places hes lived (New Jersey and Illinois, among 
others), he finds that Pittsburgh has a pretty even spread of 
SUVs versus cars. He mentioned he sees a lot of luxury SUVs 
in the Maggie Mo lot, though.
While many a college kid lusts after a ride  any ride
 design can be an important element in how you get 
from point A to point B. To make life easier for the clueless,
The Tartan has compiled some basic picks" on design 
happenings in the automotive world.
More car for your money: "Volkswagen and Subaru offer 
more performance for less money, with more attention to 
materials. Baskinger
Improving manufacturers: All companies are trying 
to improve; Ford, Chrysler, and Chevy are really paying 
attention to styling; before they [just] made cars that ran.
Baskinger
The brand I am most excited about in Japan is Mazda, in 
the past five years they have completely turned themselves 
around. Zulkie
Get used to it: Cross-over vehicles will be here for a while... 
The Jeep Wrangler is timeless. Traditional pick-ups will stick 
around, with the Honda Ridgeline being an example of the 
new breed of pick-up trucks. Baskinger
Earth-friendly design: The hybrid market needs to find 
an in-between from the over-styled Honda Insight-type 
vehicle to seamlessly integrated vehicles like the Toyota Prius 
or Highlander. They need a balance between "completely 
hidden" and completely overt in terms of announcing their 
eco-friendliness. Baskinger
"Hybrid SUVs are taking advantage of the battery motor for 
high performance in torque, rather than gas mileage.... There 
is an improvement in mileage, but not the significant kind. 
Zulkie
Gen-X-mobile: The Scion "[has] a lot of different variables; 
you get more choice. Baskinger
Well-designed: The Altima: "It has purposeful 
ornamentation." Baskinger
Blasting the past: "As cool as the retro pony cars are (new 
Mustang, new Camaro, etc.), I feel that it is a cop out to keep 
coming out with new old cars. Zulkie
Beauty only skin deep: I like the new Mustangs 
overall exterior design; however when I sat in it, I was very . 
disappointed with the cars cheap interior. Zulkie

Bringing hate crime awareness to Carnegie Mellon
When a small town comes face to face with murder, everyone 
has a story to tell.
At first glance, it's the old story of a shocking event shattering 
a small town. Beneath the surface, though, its entirely 
different. Written by Moiss Kaufman and the Tectonic 
Theater Project, The Laramie Project is a series of interviews 
with Laramie, Wyo., residents about their reactions to the 
hate crime that led to the death of Matthew Shepard.
The Tectonic Theater Project's aim was to interview the 
inhabitants of Laramie in hopes of learning about the 
effects of Matthew Shepard's death. What they found was 
a multifaceted town with over a hundred stories and many 
contradicting views. Was Laramie the type of place where 
one could freely live as he or she wanted, or one in which 
someone could only make his own lifestyle choices if he kept 
them secret? It depends on whom you talk to.
What makes this show unusual is that its 63 characters are 
played by only 13 actors, making it important for the actors 
to create clear distinctions between the different roles they 
play. In Scotch 'n' Sodas performance of The Laramie Project, 
the costume changes were minimal, such as the change of 
sophomore Kwasi Mensah's plaid shirt to transform a townie 
into a Baptist minister. This was a challenge the actors met 
and surpassed  most evident in first-year Caulder Tempels 
effortless shift from a policeman to a somewhat stereotypical 
gay man to a Republican Senator and in first-year Andrew 
Stocchettis seamless transition from University of Wyoming 
president to remorseless murderer Aaron McKinney.
Each character was not only distinct, but memorable as well. 
The audience was scared for the lives of policewoman Reggie 
Fluty (junior Danielle Griswold) and professor Catherine 
Connelly (sophomore Sarah Barbour) and was delighted by 
the feisty attitude of Matthew's friend, Romaine Patterson 
(first-year Rose Sengenberger). Particularly memorable was 
junior Gerrit Betzs portrayal of Matthews father, which left 
everyone silent following his speech to McKinney. Sophomore 
Dave Lettieri's flawless depiction of Fred Phelps was equally 
stunning.
Fred Phelps is the Baptist preacher who protested Shepard's 
funeral and murder trial. He continues to speak at various 
events about the profound evil that he believes homosexuality 
to be, and there had been rumors that he would even follow 
The Laramie Project to Carnegie Mellon.
Director Courtney Kochuba, a junior English major who 
is also president of Scotch n Soda Theater, has been 
considering putting on The Laramie Project for some time 
now. A Pittsburgh native, she says that it has never been 
produced here and that it's time for that to happen since hate 
crimes still occur. In fact, due to recent events such as a gay 
hate crime in Massachusetts and Fred Phelps' protesting of 
Coretta Scott King's funeral, this show is even more relevent.
Kochubas target audience is first and foremost Carnegie
Mellon students. "Things get us riled up, she said, such as 
Malik Zulu Shabazzs controversial speech last year. And 
when things get us riled up, we take the opportunity and do 
things. This is just to get the word out." While she hopes that 
some students will become involved in activism, it is more 
important for Kochuba that the audience understands and 
respects the message conveyed by the show even though 
they may not agree with it.
Bringing this matter to the masses was a motive of author 
Kaufman. After the death of Matthew Shepard, he asked,  
How can we, as theater people, respond to and comment on 
this situation? The members of the Tectonic Theater Project 
were not legislation-passing politicians. They were actors, 
and for them the best way to do this was through theater. 
While people may not necessarily attend an activist rally, they 
may go and see a show. A show is just another way to bring 
certain ideas to the masses."
The process of bringing the town of Laramie to life was 
extremely rewarding for the cast and crew. Kochuba believes 
that what makes Laramie come alive is the enthusiasm that 
the cast brings to the table. With all the outside work that 
the cast is loaded with, one must be really passionate about 
the show in order to put such effort into it. Moments when 
an actors research resulted in a gold mine of information, 
including personal connections, were especially valued.
Assistant director Ashley Birt, a junior English major, regards 
The Laramie Project as one of the most important plays that 
can be performed right now. She said, There is hate. It can 
happen anywhere  in a small town or even in Pittsburgh. 
But you must see how a community deals with this, how it 
affects people. There are both negative and positive results. 
It's a sad thing that happened to this kid but it raised an 
enormous amount of awareness."
Birts hope for the show is that it will make Carnegie Mellon 
think. Often many students here get so involved in their work 
that they do not know or care about what's going on in the 
world around us. She said, "CMU students need to realize 
that this is the real world. This is going on  so go out and 
change it... or at least turn on CNN.
According to Birt, CMU needs this. CMUs ready. It's time for 
this."

Spike Lee berates cultural trends
Director voices his opinion on race and new role models
Speaking at the Byham Theatre last Thursday, Spike Lee 
addressed a large group of energetic fans who gave an 
ecstatic welcome to the controversial filmmaker. Lee, director 
of Mo' Better Blues, The Original Kings of Comedy, and 
the biopic Malcolm X, came to Pittsburgh to talk about his 
films, his life, and his views, as part of the African American 
Cultural Centers series of programs celebrating Black History 
Month.
Lee recently produced CSA: The Confederate States of 
America, a mockumentary about the eerie possibilities had 
the South won the Civil War. The film, directed by Kevin 
Willmott, approaches the situation from the angle of a British 
documentary about America with short, inflammatory 
commercial breaks where racist propaganda supposedly 
would cut in.
Critics say that the film really does not describe an alternative 
present. According to Stephen Whitty of the Newark Star 
Ledger, How far off is Willmotts scenario anyway?"
Well-known for racy Spike Lee Joints like this, Lee has 
built a reputation for handling polemic subjects in brilliant, 
down-to-earth portraits. For his work in the film industry, Lee 
received an honorary Cesar Award for Lifetime Achievement 
in 2003. His career did not flourish from the start, however. 
Growing up in 1960s Brooklyn with an appreciation for 
African-American culture, Lee had no idea he wanted to be a 
filmmaker.
A supportive and assertive family gave Lee the appreciation 
for hard work and the value of education. His grandmother 
sacrificed her social security checks to help pay for college. 
My mother used to push me real hard. Back then, you
couldn't be just as good as a white boy; you had to be five 
times better,  Lee said.
Lee attended Morehouse College and said that the summer 
before his junior year, his advisor told him that all his 
electives were used up and that he had to choose a major. 
Not particularly sure about the prospect of films, Lee decided 
to take pictures. People thought he was crazy for trying to 
make a living in a vacuum.
Back then, there was almost no African-American film 
landscape, Lee said.
After graduating from the New York University Tisch School 
of the Arts in 1982, Lee spent a long time trying to make 
his first big film. When youre making your first film, you 
want to include everything  explosions, people jumping 
from building to building, and everything else," Lee said.
I realized that I had to start small. I had to begin with just 
two people talking and make it into a film. This became his 
seriously sexy comedy She's Gotta Have It.
Lees career has hit many obstacles since then, including 
the famous budget debate over Malcolm X. After his studio 
cut his funding due to overspending, Lee had to ask famous 
African-Americans like Bill Cosby and Oprah Winfrey for 
money. He raised about $11 million doing this and was able 
to include everything he thought needed to be shown. Even 
after this, however, the Nation of Islam railed against many 
parts of Malcolm X, and Lee had to cut material. Overall, he 
has established himself as a very prominent modem director.
During his lecture, Lee took some time to give some social 
commentary about modem America and African-Americans.
The power of America isnt in how many nuclear bombs it 
has, Lee said. Its power is in its media.
Overseas, Lee said, American pop culture icons are seen 
everywhere. The particular strength of music videos and the 
images they convey has created a lamentable social dynamic 
for Lee. He talked about how in his youth, young black men 
truly supported each other in all efforts athletic, romantic, and 
academic. Now, they aspire to be a pimp," said Lee. I dont 
get this infatuation with gangsterism. Its just crazy.... We 
didnt look up to pimps growing up.
By speaking on how the media worships images of 
debauchery, Lee proved that he really sees his medium as 
effective and worthwhile. He talked about having to censor 
what his children watch these days to keep the corrupt 
messages away from them.
In the question-and-answer session following the lecture, one 
public school teacher said he used the media in many parts 
of his curriculum but tried to expose his students to positive 
influences. He asked, How can I help them get past negative 
images?" Lee said, Just keep doing what youre doing. You 
have an uphill battle."
In the fall, Lees Hurricane Katrina documentary Levees be 
Broke will premiere on HBO. "We turned our back on New 
Orleans, said Lee. Weve all seen the videos and pictures.... 
Now it looks like Hiroshima after the atomic bomb.
The many films that Lee has directed span many stories and 
themes, but he says that there are many stories left to be told.

What would a musical look like 
if you ported it directly to film? 
Rentl With much of the original 
cast acting just like they did on 
Broadway, this film received mixed 
reviews. Personally, I thought the 
acting was awkward... a movie 
should be a movie. But I never 
saw the original. The singing was 
nice and enjoyable, and the story 
is all right. If you can get past the 
fact that Friday night is Dollar 
Broadway Show night, then go 
see this. And, of course, if youre a 
fan of the original, you will like this 
movie  or at least say you did to 
sound cool in front of your artsymusic friends.

A feature on libraries? Oh dear  well, it looks like you 
found something to line your birdcage with.this week. 
Scrap paper for the next big chem exam? If nothing 
else, you could make a damn good paper airplane. I 
mean, why should anyone care about the Carnegie 
Libraries?
No, seriously, Im asking: Why did Carnegie bother 
building them anyway? And how come the main 
Carnegie Library in Oakland is so much bigger than 
any of the other branches? Are they of any use to your 
average Carnegie Mellon student? And what do they do 
for the larger community of Pittsburgh?
Wait  maybe a library is more than just a foodand 
noise-free environment. Maybe a history on Pittsburgh's 
110-year-old library system is worth a read. Bear with 
me, and I think youll learn that libraries aren't as boring 
as they sound. Who knows, you might even wind up 
wanting to get a library card.
Standing outside of the South Side Carnegie Library of 
Pittsburgh, you might think youre catching a glimpse 
into the past. The building hasnt been renovated since 
its construction in 1908, and you can still see the name 
Carnegie embossed in the steel of the staircase. It 
seems even older in light of some of the more modern 
libraries in Pittsburgh, such as the one in Squirrel Hill, 
which reopened in 2005 after an extensive makeover. 
But even if the South Side branch is physically 
ancient, its still an extremely accurate barometer of its 
neighborhood and city  even its era. Believe it or not, 
the same goes for all of the Carnegie Libraries.
Lydia Scott, the department head of the South Side
branch, explained some of the ways that the library 
has developed over the years. The way people use 
the library has changed, said Scott. Technology 
is a significant factor. Over the years, the available 
audio/visual resources have been both updated and 
expanded. CDs and DVDs have replaced cassettes 
and videotapes, and the demand for books-on-CD is 
continually increasing.
The classic library connotation  as a home for 
encyclopedias, biographies, and history books  might 
have to be revised. As computers continue to rule our 
lives, there is less of a need for hard-copy resources 
than there used to be. If youve got a history paper to 
write, the smaller branches might no longer be your 
best option  several decades ago most of the research 
materials in the system were consolidated in the main 
Carnegie Library in Oakland.
What has replaced them? In the South Side branch, 
what remains is a largely new collection, including 
recent fiction and consumer health books. Library 
visitors older than Carnegie Mellon students are 
typically interested in that kind of literature. Scott 
explained, Our population is getting older. It's 
becoming common knowledge that the average age of 
Pennsylvanians is on the rise, but I was a little surprised 
to see such a statistic evidenced in the South Side 
library. Who knew that the catalog of books available 
could reflect a growing flux in demographic?
Though the Carnegie Libraries have a history of being 
dynamic, certain aspects havent changed at all. At 
any of the smaller branches, you can find a section 
devoted to local history. Scott referred me to a group of
filing cabinets in the comer of her office. In her words a 
throwback to the old system," the local history section 
of any Carnegie Library is likely to be a collection of 
pamphlets, fliers, and newspaper articles that capture 
the history of its neighborhood. It's a collection of 
documents from the past, dating back to the end of the 
19th century. This is only one example of how every 
public library in Pittsburgh has its own personality, 
reflective of its environment.
Its nice that the libraries have a stable tradition of 
cataloging history, but sometimes a lack of change 
overlaps with disrepair. When I asked Scott what kind 
of special events the South Side branch held, she told 
me that a significant limitation to hosting members of 
the community is that the library is not fully wheelchair 
accessible. Theres a ramp leading up to the front door, 
but the only conference room is in the basement, which 
requires the use of a stairwell. Additionally, the South 
Side library lacks climate control, which can cause 
an unpleasant environment during the summer and 
winter months. From the outside, the library looks like 
a landmark of the past, but these internal constraints 
arent just authentic  theyre inconvenient.
Compare all of that to the main Carnegie Library in 
Oakland, where a security guard watches the entrance^ 
Originally opened in 1895, the library is large enough 
to fit in with the neighboring museums. Its first floor 
was recently remodeled, and the people of Pittsburgh 
certainly appreciate its grandeur: Suzanne Thinnes, the 
communications coordinator of the Oakland branch, 
mentioned that the library recently hosted its first 
wedding. While libraries such as the one in South Side 
cater to older Pittsburghers, the main library is targeting

---------------------------------------------------


everyone. Thinnes pointed out that Oakland is one of 
the most diverse areas in Pittsburgh. The rare book 
room and music and art section are two of the primary 
attractions. Despite having libraries on campus, college 
students frequent the main library, valuable both for its 
selection and location.
So why arent more libraries like the Oakland branch? 
Library revitalization benefits not just the library itself, 
but also its community. Thinnes labeled the Carnegie 
Libraries as community anchors. Whenever a library 
is renovated, you can expect a resulting economic boost 
in the area. The renovation spurs an increase in library 
attendance, which in turn increases the patronage at 
local businesses, such as restaurants and cafs. And a 
rebuilt library will also beautify its surroundings. Just 
look at the intersection of Forbes and Murray, where the 
newly revitalized Squirrel Hill library steals the show.
Theres one obvious reason why some libraries are 
being revamped, while others  such as the South 
Side branch  have not yet been touched: money.
Most people think that Andrew Carnegie provided the 
city of Pittsburgh with an endowment for its libraries. 
Regrettably, said Scott, the nine people out of 10 who 
are under that impression are mistaken.
Years before he sent the famous My heart is in 
the work letter, Andrew Carnegie had another 
philanthropic pursuit on his mind. In 1890, he proposed 
the idea for a system of public libraries in Pittsburgh.
He gave $1 million to the city to cover the construction 
of the main Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh in Oakland 
and five others, but  as Scott was eager to point out
 did not pay for the books or grant an endowment.
The endowment that many erroneously believe provides 
library funds was actually allotted by Carnegie solely for 
the preservation of the citys museums.
It thus became the job of the government  and more 
importantly, the community  to set up and maintain 
the Pittsburgh libraries. If you know anything about 
Andrew Carnegie and how he thought, it might seem 
natural that this is exactly what he wanted. Thinnes 
explained that Carnegie believed that since the new 
libraries were to be for the common man, it followed 
that the common man was also responsible for them.
Throughout the entire project, it is certain that Carnegie 
meant for his libraries to be used by the laymen of 
Pittsburgh. Before the system was implemented, 
libraries had been strictly private institutions. In his 
youth, Carnegie had been allowed to benefit from such 
libraries by the kindness of their owners, but many were 
not so fortunate. Carnegie believed that education and 
literature were not luxuries for the affluent, but rather 
tools to improve the mind that were fit for the common 
man. That explains the promise adorning every one of 
Carnegies libraries: "Free to the People.
But what does that have to do with the population of 
Carnegie Mellon? Were already paying $30,000 a year; 
why should we care about free books? Here at Carnegie 
Mellon, were not really the common man. Were 
learning more from our teachers than any library could 
teach us, right?
Well, the Carnegie Libraries might not be giving our 
professors a run for their money, but there is one 
particularly compelling success story of a libraiy-goer
who received an excellent education  for free. This is 
the story of August Wilson, the late African-American 
playwright who wrote Fences and King Hedley U, 
among other works. Wilson achieved immense success 
as an adult, but began modestly as a pupil of the 
Carnegie Libraries.
A teenager unimpressed with his school system, Wilson 
dropped out of Gladstone High after one of his teachers 
questioned the authorship of a paper hed written on 
Napoleon. He was initially wary of telling his mother 
about his decision, and for a while took to pretending 
that he was still going to school each morning. To fill 
the hours, Wilson got in the habit of visiting the main 
Carnegie Library in Oakland.
And here is where his education finally began. Wilson 
claimed that his time at the library in Oakland was 
ultimately of extreme import to his life: He once said, 
Labor Historians do not speak well of Andrew Carnegie 
... [but he] will forever be for me that man who made it 
all possible for me to be standing here today.
Overall, the present situation of the Carnegie Libraries 
is complicated. They have a rich history of presenting 
the personalities of their neighborhoods and providing 
literature to the common man. Though some, including 
the South Side branch, still lack central air and an 
elevator, the Free to the People motto above the door 
has endured, and so has its legacy. Would Andrew 
Carnegie be satisfied with his libraries? That question 
may remain unanswered for the ages, but in the words 
of Lydia Scott, His mission has been met.

1908, and remains in relatively poor condition in comparison to the other local

Opeth rocks the locai scene

Despite the blinding cold of last weekend, rock fans in this 
town could take solace in the warmth of another place: this 
past Saturday saw on the order of one million tanned, drunk, 
writhing bodies on the sands of Copacabana Beach in Rio de 
Janeiro. Nothing out of the ordinary for a Brazilian summer, 
except that they were all guests of the Rolling Stones, as they 
hosted a pre-Camaval party to end all pre-Camaval parties.
Why should that make 'Burghers smile, you ask? Well, it 
reminds us that a country as glorious as Brazil exists. But 
even more so, it reminds us that live music is the lifeblood of 
any citys culture, whether theres sand or snow between your 
toes. While Rio will always be Rio, Pittsburgh was recently 
named the best city for rock in America. Perhaps this was 
a bit premature, with the recent spate of venue closings in 
Oakland and the Strip. But this Saturday also saw the return of 
Pittsburgh to its glory days, as it once again hosted relevant, 
meaningful concerts in a mid-level venue. Yes, the year has 
begun with Opeth playing one of the most eagerly awaited 
shows in recent memory, and it only gets better from here. 
Next month continues the European invasion with Children 
of Bodom playing a headlining show  a sell-out, hopefully. 
And if we may dare to dream, a few beloved lost venues could 
always come online again, no?
Until that happens, there are other signs that Pittsburgh is 
on its way to truly earning its distinction as the best city 
in America for rock. On the club'level, were starting to get 
a fairer shake as far as national and international acts go.
Tours that would usually pass us by are now stopping in. For 
example, Overkill plays the Rex Theatre on the South Side
tomonow. Now, if you havent been, the Rex has chairs all the 
way to the stage. Not exactly metal-friendly, but fans have 
made it work so much so that the Rex returned the favor last 
year by booking important acts like Kings X and UFO. After 
the shuttering of Club Laga in Oakland, the Rex has stepped 
up its bookings, and the year ahead looks good.
So, back to the Opeth show at Mr. Smalls in Millvale, where 
Devin Townsends band and Dark Tranquility opened. If you 
remotely like metal, you were there. No hype necessary for 
this one. If any band has a chance at developing a Phish-like 
following, its the Swedes that, er... rock. Mixing space-progmetal with intelligent lyrics is not the shortest path to success 
in the arena of heavy music. At least not in the current 
musical environment. While radio is no longer enamored 
with rap-metal, youre still not likely to hear an Opeth song 
on commercial radio. But it doesnt matter. Good music 
finds a way to its audience. As the word of mouth grows, so 
will the club sizes for Opeth. If you missed them this time, 
go on a road trip and see for yourself. The crowd, with its 
attention and devotion, reflects the ethic these musicians 
devote to their craft. You may even find yourself sitting down 
somewhere just so you can listen to the music in its unspoiled 
entirety.
Now, most bands would be frightened to go on after the 
Tasmanian devil known as Devin Townsend. I have personally 
seen him lay waste to crowds large and small as the leader 
of Strapping Young Lad. Its always fun to watch him heckle 
the audience, tormenting and teasing them. It's even cooler 
to see large men cackle at being made fun of. Having said
that, the DTB is a much different affair. Not the straight
forward assault that is Strapping, the DTB is an outlet for 
another side of Townsend's soul, introspective and a perfect 
match for Opeth. Touring behind a new album, Synchestia 
(out now on Pittsburghs own Inside Out Records), Townsend 
and company are out gently lulling audiences into a peaceful 
state while his Strapping mates commence writing their next 
album until he returns. Actually, thats not completely true. 
Synchestia is a beast of an album at times. There is ferocity, 
but it is the kind of fierce outburst for which a caged tiger 
is known, rather than a free one. This to me is the sense of 
Synchestia, a release of emotion from a place deep inside 
Devin's psyche. How it translates live is completely up to the 
listener.
Oh, and if you missed the Stones in Rio, dont worry. They 
filmed it for a DVD.
All the best.

You wiH abandon your plan of taking your leftover Valentines Day 
blow-up doll to class made up as Abraham Lincoln for Presidents 
Day. A stovepipe hat would block the view of people behind you; also, 
historical data indicate that President Lincoln never wore a pink bikini.
Building your own secret distillery will make you the most popular 
resident on your floor... until you start appropriating the laundry room 
facilities as grain elevators and mysteriously always smelling of overripe 
potatoes.
Your net worth will drop by $25 after G-men bust your grandma for 
counterfeiting savings bonds in 1987.
Inspired by the Winter Olympics bobsled competition, you will start 
a campaign for a four-man buggy event during Spring Carnival. 
The idea wiil gain cachet until it is discarded when you demand all 
announcements for the event also be made in French..
You will finally be able to prove that your art major friends have been 
tying you to a pole in the middle of campus every Thursday night, 
but you will lose the argument over whether tethered somnambulism 
represents performance art.
Your computer will be seized by the federal government. You will 
assume its for copyright infringement and file sharing; actually, the last 
Windows Update you did put your computer in control of nuclear plants 
in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Maryland.
Your skill in billiards is valuable when hustling gullible friends at the local 
hall, but making your boyfriend use cue chalk and a bridge in bed is 
just plain creepy.
Rite On
b, Arthur ODwyer
Three words: Drunken kangaroo boxing.
You will make ethnic stereotype jokes about the Swiss. Theyll declare 
neutrality and refuse to fight back, except by designing a cuckoo clock 
with an unflattering likeness of you or by poisoning your chocolate.
You will enter into a Faustian pact with the devil to gain advanced 
knowledge of some midterm answers, but instead of offering him your 
soul, youll agree to design his web site.
With eight days to spare, you will finally get the injunction you were 
seeking to prevent your roommate from giving up pants for Lent.
You will black out after particularly hardy partying on your upcoming 
birthday and will awaken the next day as a Congressional candidate for 
the Republican party.
