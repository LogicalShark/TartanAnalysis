ALUNNI AND STUDENTS 
MEET AT SMOKER
MUCH ENTHUSIASM AROUSED 
BY PITT GAME.
The famous operatic gem known as 
Hail! Hail! the Gangs All Here was 
probably never sung more appropri
ately than it was last Saturday even
ing at the Football Smoker. Never 
to the recollection of those present has 
there been a gathering of faculty, 
alumni and students which displayed 
more spirit and loyalty to our Alma 
Mater, or which better attested our 
deep gratitude to the men who rep
resent us on the football field.
A no more appropriate opening of 
the smoker could have been had than 
the speech which Coach Steffen made, 
in his characteristic quiet and unas
suming manner. It is sufficient to 
say that after hearing Mr. Steffen, it 
was easy to see how it is that prac
tically the same team which repre
sented us on the field last year with 
only mediocre success, came within 
an acc of pushing Pitt off of the 
football map.
Dr. Hamerschlag followed Coach 
Steffen and pointed out the ideals 
which Tech maintained in football, 
and in fact all athletics. He went on 
to illustrate how in the case of Trin
ity College they had maintained the 
same ideals of pure athletics as we do, 
and yet were able to turn out one of 
the best football teams in the east.
Following Dr. Hamerschlag the cap
tains of nearly all our former football 
teams gave short talks beginning with 
Foster, and ending with Skin Clair, 
who declared that he would like noth
ing better than to come back to school 
next year. Manager Rownd came 
next and thanked the students in behalf of the cheering, and support 
which they gave the team that after
noon. Sunny Kesner was found 
hiding over in one corner of the room, 
and was requested to mount the chair 
as had the others and add a few words. 
Well it might be said here that when 
it comes to Sunny Kesner we are 
all of the same opinion as the Maggie 
Murphy damsel who exclaimed after 
Kessy made one of his spectacular 
runs I just love that Kesner. Doc 
Marks was not able to dodge in time 
and as a result gave us a very inter
esting talk on football. Doc was 
followed by Dean Leetc, who ppoke 
on athletics in general, and compli
mented Coach Steffen and the team 
on the years record.
PLAID OUTFIGHTS BLUE AND (.OLD
(ARNEffl HOLDS PITT TO TWO TOUCHDOWNS
Although defeated by Pitt by the 
low score of 14 to 0, the Plaid eleven 
left the gridiron at Forbes Field last 
Saturday only after giving their op
ponents, as well as the local football 
fans and Pitt rooters the greatest sur
prise of the season. The game was 
virtually a victory for old Carnegie, 
for they showed that they had a foot
ball team and above all one that was 
filled with that unexcelled Carnegie 
spirit of grit and fight. Outweighed 
immensely by their opponents and 
playing against a team which has de
feated Cornell, Carlisle and the Navy, 
and has given W. & J. a harder fight 
than Yale, the Carnegie eleven went 
into the game and did themselves 
the greatest honor. A defeat of only
14 to 0 by such a team as Pitt might 
better be called a Plaid victory. In 
fact, Carnegie almost succeeded in 
scoring on their opponents. Kesner 
made an attempt at a field goal, which 
resulted in a breathless moment for 
Tech. The ball seemed almost certain 
to go over but instead, struck the goal 
post and fell back onto the field again.
By the fight and the cheering ex
hibited, Carnegie has shown that she 
lias a spirit which is unequalled. The 
team went into the fray and fought 
the hardest game which has been seen 
in Pittsburgh for a long while. On 
the other hand, Carnegies rooters ex
hibited wonderful spirit and above all 
other noises they could be heard dur
ing any part of the game, urging their 
team to fight. When the first half 
ended and Pitt had only scored one 
touchdown Carnegies rooters went 
wild and cheered constantly during 
the intermission. The Pitt students 
were likewise out in force and some 
keen cheering rivalry took place be
tween the rooters from both institu
tions.
Saturdays game gave the Plaid team 
a position of merit and esteem if 
nothing else in the hearts of local 
rooters. The football which they 
played was even a shade better than 
that of their opponents but Pitts 
great advantage in weight overcame 
them. It is of remarkable interest 
to note that Tech held Pitt for downs 
no less than five times. To show the 
fight which Tech exhibited one of 
these five was made when Pitt had 
the ball on Carnegies one-yard line. 
This illustrates the power which 
Techs line had, to hold their oppon
ents during the critical moments of 
the game.
Carnegies aerial play did not figure 
in the game as much as was expected. 
In fact almost all of Techs passes 
were intercepted or incomplete. In 
the first quarter Bob Peck intercepted 
one from Kesner to Crawford on 
Pitts 25-yard line and with good in
terference, after running 75 yards, suc
ceeded in crossing the Plaid goal 
line, but none too soon, however, for 
Marshall tackled him almost on the 
line. Instead of their forwards, how
ever, Carnegie used many trick plays 
which kept Pitt busy guessing. Pitts 
heavy backfield was better adapted 
to the less open form of game, being 
aggressive, good at bucking the line 
and difficult men to stop. As a re
sult Pitt scarcely ever resorted to the 
forward pass. Both lines were par
ticularly strong but once more Pitts 
weight gave them the superior advan
tage. One of the features of the Plaid 
mens game was their tackling, which 
was low, hard and accurate. Time 
after time they broke through the 
opponents interference and brought 
down the runner with but little gain. 
Speaking of interference one might 
say it was rather ragged, for on both 
teams it was alternately good and bad.
If one was to try to individually 
describe the stars of the game it would 
be necessary to describe the individual 
playing of every man who partici
pated, on both teams. Sunny Kes
ner, however, was one of the speedi
est and most aggressive players which 
Pitt has contended with this season. 
It seemed almost impossible to tackle 
him and he carried the ball for many 
large gains. Not only that, but he 
did all of Carnegies punting. Oeffinger and Marshall likewise played 
excellently, the former doing all of 
Carnegies kicking off. Carnegies 
ends, Lauer and both Levy and Mitch
ell, were always down under punts 
and on hand to tackle the man who 
caught the ball with little or no gain. 
The same may likewise be said for 
Pittsburghs ends, as many times the 
Plaid men were tackled before they 
could move from the spot where they 
caught the ball. In the central part 
of the line Hellstrom played well at 
center, while Crawford, Boileau and 
Holzworth likewise were towers of 
strength for the Plaid. Dutch Kreider signalized his return by playing 
a bang-up defensive game. He was in 
most every play and besides acted 
captain in place of Balsinger. Kreider

TO (TOST SEASON 
WITH ALLEGHENY
HARD GAME IS SCHEDULED 
FOR SATURDAY.
This Saturdays game brings a close 
to the 1914 football season. Allegheny 
College will be our opponents at Tech 
Field and the Plaid will be out to 
avenge last years 17-0 defeat. Alle
gheny will present a formidable line
up and will no doubt try her best to 
repeat last years performance and 
furthermore to preserve her clean 
slate for this year. They have not 
met defeat yet this season and with 
only the Tech and Grove City games 
remaining, the Methodists hope to 
clean up the schedule. If Allegheny 
beats Tech, Grove City will probably 
be easily disposed of, because we 
found the Red and White easy prey 
earlier in the season and defeated 
them by an overwhelming score of 
53-0.
The game will be a hard and des
perate one for both teams. We will 
striving hard to uphold the honor at
tained in the early season games and 
in the Lehigh and Pitt contests, while 
Allegheny will be trying for an un
defeated season. We will have at
tained a highly successful year if we 
are able to win this game, whereas, 
if we lose, much of the splendor and 
glory of last Saturdays contest will 
be dimmed. Our true worth will 
surely be measured and Carnegie foot
ball warriors will be put to the real 
acid test. Alleghenys teams are al
ways heavy and fast, and this years 
is no exception. Their line will prob
ably outweigh us, while their back 
field, composed of Cox, Bash, Recker 
and Munhall is as fast a set as any 
one cares to see. Any person who 
saw last years game will attest to 
this fact. Furthermore, Munhall is 
said to be a second McLaughrey, and 
Tech will have its hands full stop
ping this man. Ultimately, the en
tire matter will probably reduce itself 
to a state where the team with the 
greatest amount of fight and pepper 
will be returned the winner. Our 
men should realize this fact and should 
go into this game in the same spirit 
with which they entered both the Le
high and Pitt contests. It will be 
fight from the initial whistle and from 
the exhibition against Pitt, our boys 
should outgame and consequently out
play the methodists.
We must win this game. The stu
dent body should realize the import
ant part they will play to bring about 
this result. The spirit shown at the 
Pitt game was the best ever and has

VIRTUALLY A VICTORY.
Virtually a victory, is the Carnegie 
version of the football game with 
Pitt last Saturday. This opinion is 
not shared by Tech students alone, 
but by every newspaper of the city. 
In one respect only was the Plaid de
feated, namely, in the number of 
points scored. In actual playing, 
Tech outfought its heavier opponents, 
while, in the spirit evinced both by 
its team and its rooters, Carnegie out
classed its rivals. To any sport-lov
ing spectator, no matter which side 
he favored, the valiant defense of the 
Plaid in staying the attacks of the 
Blue and Gold must have been a 
revelation.
The hope expressed last week that 
more friendly relations might be es
tablished between Pitt and Tech has 
been greatly encouraged. The Pitt 
team as well as its students are to be 
commended for the sportsmanlike 
manner in which they conducted 
themselves. If much can be said of 
our opponents, how much more credit 
must be given to Steffen, Balsinger, 
Kesner, Oeffinger, Marshall, Kreider, 
Lauer, Crawford, Boileau, Hellstrom, 
Welch, Fletcher, Holzworth, Levy, 
and Mitchell, not to forget Manager 
Rownd and Capt. McCaughey, who 
unfortunately was unable to take part 
in the game. These men are Carnegie 
Heroes!
WE WANT STEFFEN.
If ever a man deserved an ovation 
at the hands of Carnegie students, 
that man is Walter Steffen, who has
given to Tech the best football team 
in its history. Every member of that 
team is to be congratulated for his 
excellent playing in the Pitt game, 
but we cannot help feeling that most 
of the ability displayed by the Plaid 
eleven was developed as a direct re
sult of the Coachs instructions. If 
the sentiment voiced at the Alumni 
Smoker last Saturday evening is sig
nificant, it echoed the unanimous de
sire that Mr. Steffen be retained to 
coach Carnegies future football 
teams. The length of time he is to 
occupy the position, is not stipulated, 
nor should it be, for Mr. Steffen has 
earned the right to its possession as 
long as he cares to maintain it.
By reason of the splendid showing 
of the Plaid against the Blue and 
Gold, Coach Steffens has indelibly in
scribed his name in the heart of every 
loyal son of Carnegie. We could sing 
his praises for many a day, but we 
can pay him no more sincere a com
pliment than to beg him to return 
to us next year. And at the athletic 
authorities we hurl simultaneously 
this command and demand for 1915: 
We want Steffen!
AMICI NOT ALMA MATER.
An incorrect notion among the stu
dents which has been manifest all this 
year and which was again particularly 
noticeable Saturday on the football 
field, is that Amici is our Alma 
Mater song. Tradition decrees that 
a student body shall rise and with 
bared head, sing the Alma Mater of 
its college. But this custom applies 
only to that one song. Hence there 
is no apparent reason for Carnegie 
graduates and undergraduates to re
move their hats when singing 
Amici.
The cause of the mistake seems to 
be the ignorance of the Alma Mater" 
song which was written by Charles J. 
Taylor to the tune of the Austrian 
National Hymn. The students should 
familiarize themselves with it in order 
to use it more frequently and also to 
refrain from singing Amici in its 
stead.
CLOSE SEASON WITH ALLECHENY
Continued from Page 1 
been commented upon favorably from 
all sides. The encouragement the 
men received last Saturday went a 
long way to bring about the splen
did showing because the Tech foot
ball men knew that they had the sup
port of the students as well as every 
faculty member. The Tech student 
body, the faculty, and the band should 
be congratulated for their splendid 
exhibition of true Tech spirit. And 
now is the time to keep the good 
work up. If the student body turns 
out again as it did, we feel sure that 
the last game of the season will be 
the spirit up fellows, and lets show 
the team and Coach Steffen that we 
appreciate their efforts. Every Tech 
man should be out in the stand on 
Saturday at 3 oclock to help celebrate 
the close of Carnegies most success
ful football season. This will also 
be the last game in which Balsinger 
and Welch will represent Carnegie. 
It would also have been the last for
Capt. McCaughey but he will unfor
tunately not be able to play. These 
three men have represented Tech for 
four years on the gridiron and de
serve to be showed some signal 
honor for their services. We should 
accord them a hearty send-off and 
make their last game one they will 
long remember. Now dont forget, 
every true Tech man will have an ob
ligation to fulfill this Saturday. In 
the stands for the kickoff at 3 oclock. 
We will probably have the Pitt team 
as our guests, so lets show them how 
a Tech student body supports its 
teams.
CARNEGIE DAY EXERCISES.
Dr. Frank J. Goodnow Will Speak.
In honor of the seventy-ninth birth
day of our founder, all school exer
cises will be dispensed with from 
10:30 until 12:30 Wednesday morning, 
November 25th. All students of the 
four schools and faculty will be ex
pected to take part in the exercises 
at the Music Hall.
Owing to Mr. Carnegie s recent 
visit to the schools the program for 
next week will be much less elaborate 
than that of previous years. The stu
dents will march to the Music Hall at 
11:00 A. M. where they will be ad
dressed by the newly elected presi
dent of Johns Hopkins University, Dr. 
Frank J. Goodnow, author and edu
cator of note. Dr. Goodnow was for
merly dean of political science at Co
lumbia University and since then has 
been legal advisor of the Chinese gov
ernment, from which position he went 
to Johns Hopkins. He has written 
many works on political science and 
government, being one of the fore
most authorities on these subjects of 
the present day.
There will also be several musical 
numbers on the program, the exact 
order of which has not yet been defi
nitely settled. All classes will be re
sumed in the afternoon.

CARNEGIE LOSES RACE 
BY TWO POINTS.
P. A. A. Led By Former Plaid Runner, 
Wins Team Prize.
Carnegie lost the P. A. A. cross
country race last Saturday by the nar
row margin of two points. P. A. A. 
won its own run with the low score 
of 32 points against 34 for Tech and 
52 for Pitt. The victory over Pitt was
very gratifying while the defeat by 
P. A. A. was shorn of its sting by 
reason of the fact that the Winged 
Head runners were led by a former 
Plaid track captain, D. W. Waite.
The fight for first honors resolved 
itself into an exciting struggle be
tween Waite and Organ, the fast 
Sharon runner who competed unat
tached. The former set the pace and 
maintained the lead until the last hun
dred yards when he was overtaken by 
Organ, beaten to the tape by a few 
feet. The winning quartet for Tech 
consisted of Walker, who finished 
fifth, Dunseith, who came in eighth, 
Rieser, who was ninth, and Handelman, who ran twelfth. Walkers 
showing was very pleasing and he 
gives promise of even further develop
ment. Dunseith ran a very game 
race. He was with the leaders for 
more than three miles when he ag
gravated an old injury and was forced 
to slow down. Rieser and Handelman 
both ran well, but due to no fault of 
theirs, were not in the best condition.
P. A. A. won the race with only 
four men entered, so that each of its 
runners had to place. Pitt was repre
sented by half a dozen men, while 
Tech had the largest number of con
testants. Nine runners wearing the 
Plaid colors, were among the first 
twenty who finished in the order 
named: Organ, unattached; Waite,
P. A. A.; Caughey, P. A. A.; Richards, 
unattached; Walker, Tech; Grum
bling, Pitt; Livermoore, Pitt; Dun
seith, Tech; Rieser, Tech; G. McMasters, unattached; Warren, P. A. A.; 
Handelman, Moore, Bayard, Benter, 
Tech; Hird, P. A. A.; Carey, De 
Young, Tech; and two Pittites.
GRAND.
An advance view of the program 
which Harry Davis has prepared for 
presentation in the Grand Opera 
House Thanksgiving Week, indicates 
that those who witness the actual per
formances will have much to be grate
ful for. It is a holiday bill of pre
eminent features offering notably the 
first opportunity we have had to see 
Douglas Fairbanks, a favorite young 
star of the legitimate drama in the 
polite varieties. Mr. Fairbanks, sup
ported by a company of four selected 
players, is to enact A Regular Busi
ness Man, a comedietta written by 
John Stokes. A variety of other fea
tures in addition to motion pictures, 
are programmed.

BASKETBALL MEN REPORT 
FOR FIRST CALL.
The initial call for basketball can
didates was made last Monday and 
a large sized squad reported at the 
gym for the preliminary practice. 
The number is increasing every day 
and many new men are reporting to 
Coach Marks. The practice for the 
next few weeks will be of a rudimen
tary nature and will consist mostly of 
shooting drill with the idea of get
ting the new men into shape for the 
opening game of the season with Pitt 
on January 5th. It is especially im
portant that new material should be
gin reporting immediately because 
they are the ones that must get ac
quainted with the playing floor at our 
gym and with the men whom they 
are likely to play. Furthermore, 
any new men that has basket
ball ability whatever or who has 
played on any prep school team 
should report himself to Coach 
Marks. There are quite a few posi
tions open on the team, in fact, the 
only man who seems to have a job 
cinched is Hines, Carnegie star guard 
Levy, Henning and Humphries. All 
first string men from last year are 
back in school and will probably be 
out for the team. Capt. Tumpane has 
beeen lost and his position will be a 
hard one to fill. Quite a few of the 
football men have excellent prospects 
of making this years team. Craw
ford, Marshall, Holzworth, Levy, 
Smith, Kelly, Howe, Fletcher, Kesner and Kreider are all proficient ex
ponents of the floor game.
We hope to have a crack aggregagation this year and in consequence 
have been booking games with some 
of the best schools in this district. 
Pitt, Penn, State, Western Reserve, 
Susquehanna, Marietta, and Juniata 
will be met. Games are also pend
ing with Lehigh, W. and J. and prob
ably West Virginia, Wesleyan. Big 
things this season are expected, and 
it might be said for the benefit of 
the new men that basketball is one 
of the most popular sports here at 
Carnegie. Therefore, for the sake of 
the school and for yourself, the new 
men are urged to come out and lend 
a hand to make this years team the 
best ever. Lets keep up the good 
start made by the 1914 football team, 
and continue the work for a booming 
year in athletics by having a firstclass basketball team. Practice is 
held on the gym after 4:30.
THE ALVIN.
Marie Dressier, the funniest woman 
on the American stage, comes to the 
Alvin Theater next week as the 
Thanksgiving attraction in her new
est and greatest comedy success, en
titled, A Mix Up. presented under 
the direction of Mr. Shubert.
There will be the regular Wednes
day and Saturday matinee, and in ad
dition to this a special matinee on 
Thursday (Thanksgiving Day.)

MECHANICAL-MHO CLUB 
MEETING.
I he regular monthly meeting of 
the Carnegie Mechanical Club was 
held on November 11 at Machinery 
Hall. After the regular meeting the 
Mechanical and Mho Clubs were 
jointly addressed by Hr. Hood, head 
of the mechanical engineering de
partment of the Bureau of Mines. His 
address was intensely interesting, es
pecially so because in the near future 
the Bureau will be a neighbor of 
ours, in fact almost a part of this 
institution. During the course of his 
address he said that the fact that 
there was going to be such close con
nection and co-operation between the 
Bureau and the Carnegie Institute was 
largely due to the untiring efforts of 
Director Hamerschlag. The Bureau 
of Mines buildings are very similar 
to our own buildings, having been 
designed by Mr. Hornbostle, and will 
be situated on Forbes street across 
the hollow from the science buildings. 
A bridge will connect the two insti
tutions. These buildings will be the 
headquarters of the Bureau of Mines 
and will house a mining, a mechani
cal engineering, a chemical, a miscel
laneous mineral, a petroleum and an 
administrative department. He out
lined the work of the Bureau, saying, 
It shall conduct inquiries and scien
tific and technologic investigations 
concerning mining, and the prepara
tion, treatment, and utilization of 
mineral substances with a view to 
improving health conditions and in
creasing safety, efficiency, economic 
development, and conserving re
sources through the prevention of 
waste in the mining, quarrying, rnetalurgical, and other mineral industries; 
to investigate explosives and peat; 
and on behalf of the government to 
investigate the mineral fuels and un
finished mineral products belonging 
to, or for the use of the United States, 
with a view to their most efficient 
mining preparation, treatment* and 
use; and to disseminate information 
concerning these subjects.
We must indeed consider ourselves 
fortunate in having such a large 
amount of research work, in much of 
which we no doubt will often take 
part, going on in our midst.
SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA WILL

SENIOR MECHANICALS TEST 
CONDENSER.
On Saturday, November 7th, four 
Senior Mechanicals, Messrs. Brock, 
Schoepfle, Flanagan and Cline, accom
panied Prof. Trinks to New Castle, 
Pa. to test two condensers for the 
Mesta Machine Company.
The condensers were installed at 
the plant of the Carnegie Steel Com
pany. They were of the Mesta type, 
ninety-six inches in diameter and were 
each capable of condensing 70,000 
pounds of steam per hour. The steam 
for these condensers is received from 
two mixed pressure turbines attached 
to turbo blowers for the Bessemer 
converters. The turbo blowers made 
by Southard Foundry Company, of 
Philadelphia, Pa., are the first to be 
used in the steel mills of the Pitts
burgh district.
Under regular working conditions 
the turbines use the exhaust steam 
from the bar mill englnfs.

INTERCOLLEGIATE STUDENT 
GOVERNMENT ASSOCIATION 
ADMITS M. M. C. S.
At the Students Assembly last 
Wednesday Lu Hartman, president of 
the Student Senate, and Grace Searight, Junior representative to the 
Senate, spoke briefly concerning their 
recent trip to Cambridge, Mass,, 
where they attended the Intercolle
giate Student Government Conference 
at Radcliffe College.
During the conference it was voted 
to admit Margaret Morrison to the 
Association. Any womans college 
giving a B. S. or B. A. degree, and 
conforming to other prescribed re
quirements, is eligible for admission. 
Delegates from the college must then 
be sent to the conference, and finally 
the college is voted into the Associa
tion by the represented colleges at the 
conference.
At the conference just past two 
womens colleges were presented for 
admission. These were Margaret 
Morrison and Agnes Scot of Decatur, 
Georgia. Agnes Scot was denied the 
privilege because of the size of its 
graduating classes. We should feel 
that our own college has taken a very 
important and worthy step in joining 
this Inter-collegiate Association. We 
will now be brought into communica
tion more directly with many of the 
largest and most influential Womans 
Colleges in the East, and we hope to 
win the respect and admiration of 
them all.
While away, Miss Hartman and 
Miss Searight visited besides Rad
cliffe, Simmons College, Wellesley, 
Vassar, Columbia University, and 
Bryn Mawr. At Teachers College, 
Columbia, they saw Anna O. Brom
ley of the class of 14. Miss Bromley 
will receive an M. A. degree this year 
from Columbia where she has been 
specializing in Psychology. They al
so saw Sigrid C. Holinger, who grad

ceive a B. S. degree from Columbia 
this year. She has been doing special
Thursday afternoon the girls gave 
an Antiseptic Tea in the Recrea
tion Room. This afternoon party was 
planned in response to the immediate 
need of the people in Europe, with the 
idea that the proceeds should be used 
to buy antiseptics and bandages for 
the wounded soldiers. Tea, cakes and 
wafers were served, while, at separate 
booths, candy and cake could be 
bought. During the course of the 
afternoon, Miss Hinman gave a very 
interesting account of her adventures 
in Europe this summer, and of the 
return trip. The hostesses were quite 
pleased to have so many of the facul
ty present and such a large representa
tion of visitors, but great disappoint
ment was felt at the little support 
given by the students. Especially, for 
such a cause one would think that 
every girl in the school could give 
some time or money, or both, towards 
making such a project a success. In 
the future, it is to be hoped, if any 
other entertainment be planned, each 
girl will do her share to make it the 
best ever.
Miss Mildred Knapp was general 
chairman and deserves great credit 
for the partys success. From the 
combined sale of candy, cake and tea, 
about sixty-three dollars were real
ized, which will be sent immediately 
to the Red Cross Society.

D. P. Murphy, Student Assembly 
President, was elected a member of

The new club room is in its forma

add to the appearance of the walls.
Students are requested to kindly re

them, and in order to avoid possible 
friction between the faculty and stu

Now that the clubroom has been 
successfully established, a room for 
quiet study has been suggested and 
the institution of such should be a 
matter of vital issue to the clubroom

THE PITT-TECH GAME
A POLL OF THE PRESS
Pittsburgh Post.
The Morning Hatchet.
There is a football team at Tech, 
It is a scrappy team, by heck,
For it tumbled into Pitt 
And it shook em up a bit,
And it made an awful hit.
Did Tech.
PEACEABLE.
Were going to have quite a let of 
box fights in Pittsburgh, but there 
wont be half as much fight in them as 
there is in the Tech team.
From the result of the game, its 
lucky Pitt didnt have any more regu
lars in the Plaid game.
POOR BOOB!
One of our reporters said that Pitt 
got Techs goat, showing what be 
knows about football.
Florent Gibson.
Taking its showing against Pitts 
great eleven at Forbes Field Satur
day as a basis, Carnegie Tech demon
strated that it is no inconsiderable fac
tor in football doings in this section. 
To hold the Blue and Gold to a pair 
of half-earned touchdowns, even 
when the Pitt team plainly wasnt 
prepared for a hard contest, is no 
mean achievement for the Plaid.
But now with this achievement to 
look back to, there is no reason why 
Carnegie should not cut a wide swath 
in future seasons, and undoubtedly it 
will do this very thing if the present 
policies which have done so much for 
the Tartan are adhered to for a few 
years.
In, Walter Steffen, the old Maroon 
quarterback, Tech has a regular find. 
His performance this fall has demon
strated that he can build up winning 
teams, and if he continues at Tech, 
as is to be hoped, and receives the 
enthusiastic support and co-operation 
he has been accorded in his first sea
son, the Plaid will flaunt high before 
many seasons are past.
Fighting with a fury and despera
tion not seen on Forbes Field for a 
long time, Carnegie Techs little elev
en, lean, lithe and primed for the fray, 
held Pitts heavier legionaries to a 
14-to-0 score and came very nearly 
scoring itself. It was, virtually, a vic
tory for the Plaid, and is so regarded 
by the Tech team and its admiring 
adherents. Tech students went wild 
with joy after the game was over and 
swarmed out into the field where they 
performed the snake dance usually 
reserved for victories.
Techs achievement in holding the 
greatly superior Pitt machine ranks 
as the greatest surprise of the local 
football season. Everybody expected 
that the Carnegie eleven would be 
crumpled up like paper and thrust 
back before the Pitt charges, but the 
Tech lads, plainly pointed for this 
game, didnt crumple worth two 
whoops, and the Pittites had to call 
upon the reserves before they were 
through.
In the face of the opposition offered 
by Coach Steffens aggregation, Pitt 
really was fortunate to score. Pitts 
points were not earned by a steady 
cumulative attack, but were the result 
of the alertness of individuals who 
seized instant advantage of Carnegies 
misplays and turned them into vic
tory.
Gazette Times.
James Jerpe.
Tech students certainly burn with 
enthusiasm for their football eleven 
and their demonstration at Forbes 
Field on Saturday was one long to be 
remembered. Yales "Boola-Boola 
and Penns Hail Pennsylvania never 
sounded sweeter to their followers 
than the cleverly arranged and har
monious songs of the Plaid student 
body. Their singing was indeed a re
minder of what can be heard on a 
big day at Franklin Field. Tech isnt 
strong for the old rah rah stuff but 
instead has introduced some fine 
songs that are good to the ear and 
must certainly inspire the athletes for 
whom they are sung. Techs enthu
siasm is as genuine as it is intense 
and their finely organized endeavors 
at Forbes Field were noisy, but har
monious and inspiring. The Tech 
songs were indeed a treat, so was their 
teams exhibition.
Richard Guy.
The Tech rooters Saturday gave 
every encouragement to their quar
terback, Kesner, by cheering him on 
most every play he took part in, par
ticularly when he was carrying the 
ball. Kesner looked the part of a real 
good football player, and he ought to 
develop into a player of still higher 
merit. He handled his team smooth
ly, and used good h'-ad work, and lie 
had quite a few formations to handle. 
He is a strong tackier, and on the of
fense he leads tiie interference in fine 
fashion, and when he has the ball him
self he is mighty hard to handle.
WHAT IT MEANT TO TECH.
When Pitt and Tech quit football 
relations two years ago the Tech team 
had practically no standing in the 
football world, although it had legions 
of well-wishers. The public admired 
it for its spirit, but did not give it 
much of a rating. However, Dr. Bill 
Marks came to the institution from 
Pennsylvania and with Coach McCul
lough started to boost the game. This 
year the team was given more encour
agement by the engagement of Wal
ter Steffen of Chicago fame. Steffen 
started to perfect a machine, and all 
year his men have been playing excel
lent. football, losing only to Lehigh 
by a close margin and then a game to 
Westminster. But Saturday the cli
max was capped to the pleasure of 
the Tech students by holding Pitt to 
such a low score and by outplaying 
the stronger adversaries in more than 
one department of the game. Tech 
has demonstrated Sts' worth in the
game, and from now on will be ac
corded more consideration by the 
football public and the annual PittTecic games in the future \\ ill Mirely 
be attended by considerably more in
terest.
* * * Thus it may be seen that
Pitt was favored with fortune in ac
quiring its points, and it needed these 
breaks in the luck of the game, for in 
aggressiveness and plaving the funda
mentals of football, Tech was the su
perior. Tech was outclassed as to 
physical prowess, as its men are not 
of the size and strength of Pitt, but 
the wearers of the Plaid playei to the 
best of their ability.
Dispatch.
David J. Davies.
Carnegie Tech placed itself on the 
football map Saturday when it held 
the formidable University of Pitts
burgh eleven to 14 points and upon 
more than one occasion threatened to 
score. Techs reportoire was much 
more extensive than that boasted of 
by the Gold and Blue; and with a little 
more weight in the line and an ab
sence of the nervousness which mani
fested itself upon all occasions, the 
Plaid might have done things to the 
Big School outfit.
It must not, for a moment, be be
lieved that the Gold and Blue players 
did not exert their very best efforts. 
Coming to realize that Tech was not 
the mean, puerile foe she had been 
imagined, Messrs. Heil, Fry, Dillon, 
et al., put forth their every ounce of 
strength; their bag of tricks was emp
tied and stuff that had not been in
tended for use was brought into requi
sition time and again.
If it so happened that the Tech 
players showed the Pitt players any
thing new in football, what about the 
lesson taught the Gold and Blue stu
dents in the art of rooting and cheer
ing? No such splendid performance 
as that offered by the Plaid boys has 
been witnessed on Forbes Field for 
yearsperhaps never! Rooting and 
cheering like mad, even while their 
team was 7 points14 pointsto the 
bad, the Techites surely showed that 
of spirit they had an abundance and 
that the word quitting has been 
eliminated from their dictionaries.
Eight hundred Tech men joined in 
the oral efforts Saturday. Their cheer
ing was artistic and their singing was 
splendid. There were no ragged ef
forts; everything attempted was fin
ished splendidly, and to the Skibos 
went the honors of the occasionin 
one department at least.
Although Tech was unable to push 
the pigskin across Pitts goal, the 
Plaid deserves great credit for the 
wonderful game it played. In every 
quarter the Skibo warriors fought gal
lantly and time after time Pitt found

fought for every point of the game 
and took advantage of every opening 
that presented itself. His aggressive
ness was remarkable. The center 
of Pitts line was well taken care by 
Peck and Soppitt, the former scoring 
Pitts first touchdown. In the back 
field Fry was the opponents indivi
dual star, being by far their most con
sistent ground gainer. In the latter 
part of the game, Pitt put in her star 
quarterback, Williamson, who has 
been out of the game ever since the 
first of the season. Dillon, Miller, 
Heil, and DeHart were likewise inval
uable to their team.
First Period.
Oeffinger kicked off to Fry, who re
turned the ball 15 yards to Pitts 31- 
yard line. Dillon hit the line for four, 
but the ball was called back and Tech 
lost five yards for offside playing.
Dillon again hit the line for four and 
ran left end for 17 more and a first 
down on Pitts 47-yard line. Miller 
assaulted center for a seven-yard ad
vance. Heil tried the right end for 
two. Fry ran from an extended order 
play, gaining his distance, but the ball 
was called back and again Tech lost 
five yards for offside playing, giving 
Pitt the ball on the Tech 39-yard line 
on a first down. A double pass, Miller 
running with the ball at the tackle 
yielded to Frys assault for a fiveyard advance. Miller hit the same 
place for three more and then Fry 
tried it without gaining and the ball
went to Tech on downs on its own 
30-yard line.
Oeffinger made his length at right 
guard. Balsinger fumbled and recov
ered without loss or gain. Kesner 
punted 45 yards to Heil on Pitts 30- 
yard line and Heil came back to the
41-yard mark.
Fry hit the line without gaining and 
Miller made four at left end. From 
a kick formation Fry toosed a forward 
pass that Kesner intercepted and ran 
back 30 yards to his own 46-yard line.
Balsinger tried left end and failed 
and Pitt was assessed a five-yard off
side penalty. On a triple pass Kesner 
failed to gain at right end, but tried 
the left flank for two. Levy muffed 
Kesners forward pass and when Kes
ner punted to the Pitt 26-yard line, 
Lauer of Tech touched the ball and it 
went to Pitt at this point.
Dillon circled left end for a 22-yard 
run, which gave Pitt a first down on 
its own 48-yard line. He made three 
more at the other flank and miller 
failed to gain at right tackle. Fry 
dropped back as if for a kick and 
Heil penetrated the line five yards. 
Miller made one in a buck at the 
right side, but it was not enough and 
Tech held for downs on its 43-yard 
line.
The entire Tech line shifted far over 
and Marshall charged for three yards 
behind the forwards. Levy, end 
around, made three at left end. Fry 
broke up Kesners forward pass and 
Kesner booted to Heil, who returned 
from the 17 to the 30-yard line before 
being forced out of bounds. Balsingers right leg was hurt on this play and 
he was forced to the sidelines, Kreider taking his place. Thornhill went 
in at tackle for Jones.
On an extended order play Miller 
of Pitt fumbled and Holzworth was 
on the ball for Tech, giving the Plaid 
the ball on Pitts 24-yard line. Reese 
got Kesner back of the line for a fouryard loss.
Peck, on Pitts 25-yard line, inter
cepted Kesners forward pass and, 
dodging through half of the Tech 
team, raced his way to the goal line. 
Just before he reached it Marshall 
nailed him, but he fell over the line 
at the extreme corner of the field. 
Heil punted out to Fry who heeled 
the ball on the 16-yard line before the 
posts and booted it over. Score, Pitt
7, Tech 0.
Carlson returned Oeffingers kickoff eight yards to the Pitt 25-yard 
line before Kreider nailed him. Fry 
failed at the line and punted to Kes
ner, whom Carlson threw on Techs
34-yard line. Carlson hurt his should
er on this play and Matson took his 
place.
On a shift formation Kreider ran 
for two and Oeffinger made two more 
in the right side of the line. Heil 
brought back Kesners punt from the 
25 to the Pitt 38-yard line. Dillon 
made two in the line and the quarter 
was up, Pitt 7, Tech 0.
Second Period.
Mitchell went in for Levy. With 
the ball in Pitts possession on its 
own 40-yard line, second down and 
eight to go, Fry forward passed to
Heil for an inconsiderable gain of 
three yards. Another pass launched 
by Fry failed and Pitt lost five yards 
because Matson was offside. Fry 
punted to Marshall on Techs 14-yard 
line, Kesner hit the line without gain
ing and punted to Heil on Techs 45- 
yard line. He came back four yards.

SCIENCE SCHOOL NOTES
McCORMICK SPEAKS AT MASS 
MEETING.
Pitts Chancellor Lectures to Science.
Samuel B. McCormick, head of the 
University of Pittsburgh, spoke at the 
regular Wednesday Mass Meeting of 
the Science students, on November 
11th, at 10:30. The Chancellor was the 
second Pitt man to lecture this year, 
Mr. Scovel, who spoke on life insur
ance, being the other.
In talking about the future of Tech 
and Pitt, the speaker said in part: 
I am looking forward in the gradual 
development of these institutions to 
the time when we shall exercise on 
the community an influence stronger 
than it has ever felt. . . . Now it 
seems to me if we can collect ten thou
sand men in this part of the city, the 
educational center, the geographical 
center, the beauty center of the city, 
Im sure that we shall be able to ex
ert an influence upon Pittsburgh which 
shall be an influence for good.
The latter part of the address was 
upon the general subject of man. 
Everything worth knowing in the 
world can be divided into two heads 
according to the Chancellor. First, 
the right kind of a man to live in 
the world; and second, the right kind 
of a world for the man to live in. It 
seemed to me that while there was no 
foundation for boasting that we are 
the best nation in the world, it was 
possible for us to boast that we had 
the power to be best among the na
tions of the world. This thought of 
mine existed long before I had any 
knowledge of the calamity that was 
to fall upon Europe. ....
The second part is the making 
of the world in which the ideal man 
is to dwell. I take it that the men 
gathered in this room are primarily 
responsible for the kind of a world we 
live in. I refer this morning only tc 
the making over of the physical world 
in which this ideal man is to dwell. 
According to the law of creation, it 
is mans duty to overcome and subdue 
all inferior forces. Of all men, it is 
the engineer who must, as the Scrip
ture prophecy says, subdue all things 
unto himself. This divine mission of 
his is to change the world from the 
world it is, to the ideal world for 
men to live in. . . . Anything that 
will command us, that will inspire us 
to lift our eyes from our daily tasks 
to other achievements, is bound to 
lift up the ideal man.
So it is not a little work in which 
you are engaged today, it will be no 
little work in which you are engaged 
when you go out to do your work in 
the world; it will be no less than the 
making yourself ideal in character 
while making the world an ideal 
place to live in.
A POLL OF THE PRESS
Continued from Page 5 
herself forced to extend herself to the 
utmost to stay the terrific onslaughts. 
After trying every other method of 
scoring, Tech resorted to the field 
goal in the last period, and failed there 
by a fraction of an inch; Kesners kick 
started for the objective, but curved 
to the right, suddenly, and the ball 
bounced off the right goal post. That 
was the nearest Tech came to escap
ing a goose-egg tally.
In point of speed and trick forma
tions Tech outplayed Pitt. The Tech 
backfield sized up as one of the speed
iest that has been seen here this sea
son. It was due only to Pitts sturdy 
line and her steady ends that Tech 
was held scoreless. Some of the plays 
the Plaid boys unfolded were difficult 
for her opponents to break up espe
cially a rapid shift formation and a 
delayed pass.
The Tech players also appeared to 
excel at tackling. They hit their men 
low and hard and seldom missed a 
tackle. When one man missed there 
was always several others behind him 
to achieve the desired result. Prac
tically all of Pitts long runs were 
made through an open field.

An intercepted forward pass and a 
fumble were the main reasons for the 
defeat of Carnegie Tech at the hands 
of the Pitt eleven at Forbes Field 
Saturday in a game which was close 
and hard fought, and which kept the 
rather small crowd on edge during the 
entire playing time.
The final count was 14-0, but con
sidering the fact that Tech is a far 
lighter team than Pitt, and was thus 
under a great handicapthe score, 
low as it was, does not do justice to 
the remarkably game exhibition of 
football displayed by Coach Steffens 
players.
One of the big features of the battle 
was the cheering contest between the 
two institutions between the halves. 
Tech has cheering perfected to a point 
a little in advance of Pitt and this was 
shown in the singing and yelling. One 
of the Tech cheerleaders, Merrill by 
name, became so excited during the 
contest that he collapsed and had to 
be carried from the field.

Fortune smiled upon the heavy 
Blue and Gold team at the critical 
moments Saturday afternoon and as 
a result the lighter team of Carnegie 
Tech was defeated, but by the ex
tremely low score of 14 to 0. The 
game was featured throughout by the 
clever playing of the Plaid outfit, and 
the result was a surprise to the sport
ing world.
Steffens boys held the Pitt outfit 
for downs five times. This will prob
ably impart to everyone the great 
strength displayed by the Plaid line. 
On one occasion, when the Pitt crew 
seemed to work the Plaid line at will 
for big gains, Quarterback Kesner be
gan coaxing the boys to fight hard. A 
change came over the Tech boys 
which was noticeable to all. The Pitt 
rushes failed to work and when Tech 
was given the ball on downs, the pig
skin was resting on Techs one-yard 
line.

The splendid showing made by the 
Carnegie Tech team against Pitt on 
Saturday indicates that the day is 
coming when an annual meeting of the 
elevens representing these local insti
tutions will be one of the red-letter 
events in Pittsburghs football sched
ule. In holding the Blue and Gold 
to 14 points the Skibos surpassed the 
hopes of their most sanguine support
ers and came out of the fray with 
something closely akin to an actual 
victory to their credit. It is not to 
be denied that Pitt failed to play the 
best football of which Duffs team is 
capable, but that does not alter the 
fact that Tech played a bang-up game, 
was all business from start to finish 
and stuck to the hopeless task that 
confronted them with a spirit that 
compelled admiration. Owing to the 
conditions existing at Tech and the 
inability to get all the players togeth
er for practice as easily as is pos
sible at other institutions it was no 
easy job that Walter Steffen tackled 
this fall, but the former Chicago star 
has accomplished wonders in a short 
time, and judging from his rate of 
progress in 1914 he will have the Plaid 
mingling with the fastest company a 
year or two hence. At least Tech has 
earned a regular place on the Pitt 
schedule.
