CARNEGIE VS. PITT
THE BASKET BALL teams t Carnegie and Pitt wlii meet to
morrow night at Carnegie gym. In the second.game' of the .series. The 
first game was-chialked -upon the'Tartans aide of the ledger, but 
this means nothing tomorrow. Since that game, Carnegie haa loat to 
W. d. J. and Grove City, while Pitt lost to. West Virginia and defeated 
W. & J. It Is going'to be a real battle, because the Panther does'not 
take.kindly to defeats by Carnegie, end Carnegie has the Incentive 0 
clinching the series with a victory. One thlng la certain, and. that Is 
* every Carnegie student able'to walk should be at the gym tomornight to give the team some vocal encouragement., 
w 
THE-GROVE CITY GAME
CARNEGIES BASKET BALL team put up a game battle wilh the 
Grove City quint onSaturday evening, and came near causingthe 
downfall of the great Crimson five. The entire team played fine baskist 
bail, although CapUln Ray Hurd was . the big gun,'displaying the 
brand of'ball he is really capable of. Had it not been for poor foul 
hooting, seven out .of fifteen, that game would now be listed as a 
Carnegie victory. However, considering tbe layoff over exams, the 
team deserves a world of praise for the showing they made.
A CHALLENGE FROM JAPAN
THE MESSAGE received at Ruddys offico last Wednesday, from 
Waseda University of Tokio, Japan, requesting a baseball game with 
Caraeglo Bome timo in June, proves two IhiogB conclusively: That 
the reputation of Carnegie now extends to the Far East, and that 
Pung Chow is not the only game played in Japttn. They certainly 
have a good baseball team to want to inrade this country, beard
ing th lion In his-denwith his own claws! Too bad baseball Is no 
inger a recognized.Bport here, or a game might have been arranged.
"DOC" MARKS TO ASSIST PIRATES
DOCTOR MARKS confirmed the report that he is (o receive, a 
>rlng leave of absence in order to go west with the Pittsburgh PI' 
rales baseball club, to assist in conditioning tho men. It seems that 
last season's downfall was partially blamed on aliments incurred by 
the players in training camp, and this year.they decided to tafce a physician along. *
t is certain that they could not have secured a belter man than 
or the-job. He knows bis stuff about his prof&sion-and can take 
care of any. ailment which develops. If the Pirates dont cop the 
tnt this year, theyll have to look elsewhere for an alibi!

Now that the examination period 
over and the faculty has ceaBed

it has beon decided.by a body representing SAld  faculty that the 
hail might be. used'for'purposes 
purely athletic fa natare. Some 
?embers of the Intelligence' divi
soli believing! in the theory, of supsrorlty of mind over metter w^re 
vehy reluctant to give up such a 
buildlDg to such mundane pur* 
suits. They were finally convincod 
by copious use of clubs, bombs and 
machine guns that it was. all right 
to play basket ball at odd inter
vals providing that, those .who 
played had already passed a'course 
in Calculus showing thorn to be 
lentally'flt for th game.
Our friends on yonder hillside 
will be the guests of the evening' 
at the first-home game of the sea* 
which will .bo staged next 
Wednesday evening at aforemen
tioned gymnoelum. This will be 
the-socond-game of the series be-,

this year's series wois woni by Car

Panthers are out for revenge and 
wilt present the same -team as In 
tho first game.
Cbrnegie will probably have the

Boyhood at.Bethel.
Joyce Hctli  161-Yea Negress. -
Once upon a time there was a man whose 
life's ambition was to take unto himself a 
pipe. Time and again his heart was set on 
some particular pipebut poor fellow, his 
dreams never came true. . .
Until one day a friend; experienced in 
such afiairs, gave him a few pointers.- He 
took his friends advice; he got some 
Granger Rough Cut... Itworked! Inafew 
weeks' time he was solidly wedded to a 
wonderful pipe., .sitting pretty .fixed forlife!
Indeed, but for Granger many a man 
would never know the joy and comfort of 
a pipe! Granger is so: mild, so mellow, so 
cool! Ripe old Burley tobacco, mellowed 
Wellman's way. And cut in rough flakes 
that bum slow and smoke tool.. .
Granger's mission in life is to see that 
no man ever experiences a pipe disappoint
ment.. . Just stick to Granger and your 
old pipe'll be a perfect palright through 
the years.. Forever!
