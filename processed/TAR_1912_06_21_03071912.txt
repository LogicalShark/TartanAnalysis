P. A. A. MEET SATURDAY.
Ex-Capt. Wait Breaks Arm.
With the biggest track event of the 
local indoor season to be run off on 
Saturday, March 9, Carnegie Tech will 
be badly crippled. D. W. Wait, last 
years captain and star distance man, 
sustained the extreme misfortune of 
a broken arm while indulging in that 
gentle form of exercise known as 
rough house. The fracture is in the 
right wrist and is a simple one, but 
will disable Wait for several weeks 
as far as athletics and school work 
are concerned. Following so closely 
upon the heels of a case of mumps, the 
accident is a calamnity to Wait and 
to the activities with which he is con
nected.
Because of disqualifying conditions 
in scholarship several more stars will 
not represent Carnegie Tech in the 
coming meet. Steinmetz and Hosey 
are both in bad standing at present, 
which cripples the relay team, and 
weakens our strength in the spirits. 
They will raise their conditions in all 
probability, before the outdoor season 
starts.
Relay trials were held last Saturday, 
but were discouraging to Coach Ramsdell because so few men reported. The 
new men are holding back when they 
are most needed and have the best 
chance to make good., The relay 
team will be picked from Chuck 
Crawford, H. E. Murphy, Sperry, 
Wildberg, Frank Crawford and Capt. 
Boots. The last named has never run 
a quarter-mile race but has strength 
and speed enough to carry him the 
distance at a fast clip.
Men representing Carnegie Tech 
have been entered in the following 
events:
60-yard handicap,
60-yard novice,
440-yard novice,
880-yard handicap,
2-mile run handicap,
60-yard high hurdle handicap, 
12-pound shot put.
Running high jump.
University relay race.

CARNEGIE MECHANICAL 
SOCIETY MEETING.
The regular monthly meeting of the 
Carnegie Mechanicals will be held on 
Wednesday, March 13th, in the so
ciety club room in Machinery Hall. 
The speaker of the evening will be 
Mr. F. H. Kindi, Jr., who will talk 
on The Oxygen Melting Process. 
This is the first time that the society 
has had one of its own members for 
the speaker and it is desired to have 
a large turn-out. The eats commit
tee will be there in full force.
CHARTER TO BE APPLIED FOR.
Power to Grant Degrees to Be Ob
tained.
May Posibly Be Secured in Time for 
Commencement.
At a meeting of the Board of Trus
tees of the Carnegie Institute held re
cently the Board acted favorably upon 
the recommendation of the Commit
tee on Technical Schools looking to
wards the application for a charter 
with the power to grant degrees. The 
matter is now in the hands of the at
torneys of the Board who are prepar
ing the application. President Wil
liam N. Frew and Chairman William 
McConway will have the matter in 
charge and expect to have the neces
sary papers drawn in accordance with 
the law at a very early date.
If this charter can be secured this 
spring it may be possible to award 
degrees at the next Commencement. 
This will be good news to a great 
number of our students, graduate and 
undergraduate, but as the known de
lays of the law in the State of Penn
sylvania are viewed in retrospect it will 
be wise for the students not to have 
their hopes of the successful outcome 
of these plans unduly raised at so 
early a date.
Nevertheless, since the Board of 
Trustees have acted favorably on this 
matter it is only a question of time 
(and that at no distant future) when 
this badge of recognition will be avail
able for our graduates.

TRUSTEES TO PAY US A VISIT. 
Will Be Given Dinner at M. M. C. S.
On next Wednesday evening, March 
11th, the Board of Trustees are going 
to pay us a visit. They will be given 
a dinner at M. M. C. S. at 6:15 oclock, 
and following that will inspect the 
Schools. Their purpose in making 
this visit is to have demonstrated to 
them the methods of teaching in the 
various departments and schools. In 
order that this may be best accom^ 
plished, it may be necessary to hold 
classes which might not be regularly 
in session at that time. If this were 
not done, the Trustees would not have 
the opportunity to see all the de
partments in full working order. It 
is therefore hoped that all students 
will willingly act with the authorities 
in this matter and enable the Trus
tees to see each and every department 
working at its best.
PITT WINS SECOND.
Plaid Five Plays Close Game.
THURSDAY MORNING
LECTURE.
After letting Pitt get an early lead, 
then following close until the last few 
minutes of play, when a whirlwind 
finish brought the score almost to a 
tie, Carnegie Tech dropped the sec
ond game of the series to their fellow 
citizen. Because Pitts new gym was 
not finished in time, the game was 
played on the Westinghouse Clubs 
floor in Wilkinsburg on Friday night, 
March 1st.
Only ten of the faithful were out 
to cheer the team through the con
test, which is unusually poor spirit. 
Pitt was represented by a few more, 
but failed to produce more noise.
The first half was slow; with poor 
playing on both sides. Colvin was 
the only score-maker for the Plaid, 
making good in his foul-shooting and 
getting one basket from the floor. 
Ochsenhirt scored three of Pitts five 
goals in the half.
The second period was livelier. 
Yahres made four baskets on diffi
cult shots, besides playing a good 
floor game. D. Williams guarding 
was really the feature of the half. So 
hard did the men play that another 
minute would undoubtedly have 
brought the score that would have 
won the contest.

The Tartan committee of the Alum
ni Association has decided to edit an 
edtion of the Tartan about the first 
of May A copy of this edition will 
be mailed to each Alumnus.
Dr. Emil Swensson, one of the lead
ing Civil Engineers of the city, was 
the speaker last Thursday morning at 
the general lecture hour. Dr. Swenson is a native of Sweden but has 
been a practicing engineer in this 
country for the past thirty-five years. 
He took as his subject, The Quali
ties of an Engineer; the substance 
of his speech was somew'hat as fol
lows:
Nowadays too man}- young men 
think they can become engineers by 
learning drafting, but this is a mis
take, because the education a man can 
receive in this manner is not sufficient. 
Many times it has happened that when 
two young men, one a trained engi
neer and the other not, start out side 
by side at the same kind of work, they 
will keep advancing about equally for 
a certain time, but after that the man 
with education is bound to pass the 
other.
Dr. Swensson has no patience with 
the so-called practical man, for the 
creed of such a man is to meet con
ditions when they meet you, while it 
is the function of the educated engi
neer to anticipate these very condi
tions and be ready for them. In other 
words, in order to be a successful en
gineer, a man must have the educa
tion and ability to analyze his condi
tions beforehand.
Other requisites of a good engineer 
are an ability to use good English 
and an aptitude for doing things with
out being shown him; the latter is a 
quality which usually determines 
whether or not a man is to surpass.
On account of the fact that Dr. 
Swenssons talk was not on any par
ticular branch of engineering, but of 
a more general nature, it was well 
received by the students, and his hu
morous remarks appreciated.---------o---------
THE PITT PLAY.
Last Tuesday evening, February 
27th, the University of Pittsburgh pre
sented, as a part of its 125th anniver
sary exercises, the historical play, 
The Vision of She-WTho-Knows, by 
Mr. Geo. Seibel, of the Gazette Times.
The play, written in very blank 
verse, tells the story of the coming of 
a number of characters, all of whom 
have played a part in the history of 
Pittsburgh, to the woodland peeress 
She-Who-Knows, each craving a 
boon. She grants their requests in a 
vision, presented as a tableau. The book 
of the play is good.
It is interesting to note that the 
scenery and tableaux were designed 
by Miss Louise Miller, and that sev
eral of the back-drops and properties 
were painted by L. A. Withers and
H. P. Smith, all of the School of Ap
plied Design.

with the security which comes with 
certainty, all of these feelings roll 
away as the clouds after a storm and 
we rest content, coming into our own 
with double pleasure because our in

earned this power, the power to grant 
degrees.---------o---------
WHAT IS THE TROUBLE?
An election was of second as
sistant baseball manager which was 
set free for last Thursday had to be 
postponed because no candidates had 
presented themselves for considera
tion. What is the trouble? Is it there 
are no men in this institution who are 
willing to accept this office? Or is 
it because the men available are too 
modest to come forward and offer 
their services? What ever the reason 
may be, it is a pretty poor showing 
up of the spirit of men in the classes 
eligible to enter candidates. Now that 
the postponement has been made, 
these classes will have an opportunity 
to redeem themselves in the eyes of 
the balance of their fellow students 
by seeingto it that enough men come 
out to insure the team of as good an 
assistant manager as can be obtained.

LAST THURSDAYS LECTURE.
DEGREES.
The announcement, on the first page 
of this issue, that favorable action had 
been taken by the Board of Trustees 
of the Carnegie Institute upon the 
recommendation of the Committee on 
Technical Schools looking toward the 
application for a charter with the 
power to grant degrees will prove 
the best kind of news to the Faculty, 
Alumni, and student body. It is an
other step forward, one which will be 
hailed with joy from all quarters and, 
while it will mean much to the gradu
ates, it will mean much more to the 
institution itself. In short, it will 
mean that the Carnegie Technical 
Schools will receive recognition, as 
expressed by the right and power to 
grant degrees, for the quantity and 
quality of the work they are doing.
That it may be possible to obtain 
the charter and the degree granting 
power in time to award the present 
Senior class at Commencement does 
not detract from the pleasure with 
which we greet this announcement. 
The Seniors will be especially pleased 
and we trust that it will be possible 
to confer degrees on June 14th, but, 
as is pointed out in the article, hopes 
should not be set too high. Anyway, 
the mere matter of whether degrees 
are given next June or next October 
is unimportant when compared to the 
fact they are to be granted in the 
near future. Those graduates who 
have waited so patiently since 1908 
will be well content to wait a short 
time longer, secure in the knowledge 
that degrees will be eventually con
ferred, and those graduating in June 
should be willing to do likewise. All 
comes to those who wait is an old 
saying. Long have we waited, im
patiently at times, considering our
selves deprived of our just due, the 
objects of a rank injustice. Now,
At last Thursdays lecture, Mr. 
Swensson assured us that it gave him 
great pleasure to address such a body 
of young men. We beg leave to as
sure Mr. Swensson in return that he 
gave more pleasure than he received. 
There was not a student who had the 
opportunity to hear that lecture who 
did not enjoy it and who would not 
have been willing to have Mr. Swen
sson talk for four hours, as he said 
he was prone to do. To have the op
portunity to hear once a week men of 
Mr. Swenssons callibre is a treat; 
to be given in so intimate a manner 
side lights upon what is to be our 
lifes work is a liberal education. 
Whether we, in our wisdom, agree 
with all that these experienced gen
tlemen say does not affect in the 
slightest the interest of their talks. 
In fact, this possible disagreement of 
belief does rather the reverse and lends 
to the situation a bit of color quite 
lacking, let us say, in a math, lecture 
where we can not and dare not dis
agree.
It must be confessed, in pass
ing, that we . could bring our
selves to accept all that Mr.
Swensson said. We have especial ref
erence to those instances he told of, 
in which he labored long in a field 
other than his own to obtain certain 
specific information. It occurred to 
us, by some strange chance, that un
der similar circumstances, instead of 
consulting the Technology Depart
ment of the Carnegie Library, we 
would have gone to a reliable chemist 
and in short order found out that 
which we desired to know. But then, 
it is merely a difference in methods, 
we suppose, and that difference did 
not take away from the pleasure we 
took in listening to Mr. Swensson.
The lecture course is a great insti
tution and we owe a unanimous vote 
of thanks to the man responsible for 
its appearance in the schedule and to 
the men who so kindly consent to 
come and speak to us.

LEATHER BOUND THISTLE 
EXHIBITED.
Considerable interest has been 
aroused by the sample of the leather 
bound Thistle exhibited in the dif
ferent schools. Quite a number of 
fellows and girls, too, have ordered 
these books to be sent home. 
Judging from the names, the various 
purchasers have asked to have print
ed on the cover, most of the books 
are evidently to be given to some 
favorite cousin.
Ordrs for these books are taken 
by any member of the Thistle Board 
upon the receipt of the one dollar 
and a half ($1.50) additional charge.
The Board orders these books only 
to please those who may desire them 
in preference to the cloth-bound 
books, as there is no financial gain 
whatever, the $1.50 being the actual 
charge of the printer.
This book will be exhibited in all 
classes during the next week.

BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT.
Last weeks tournament games af
forded several interesting contests. 
All were hard-fought,the twenty 
minutes of play were filled in each 
case by tense rivalry. Most of the 
teams have now played half the sched
ule, and their relative standing gives 
good evidence of their strengths, but 
the coming games may upset all dope 
as to the league leaders.
The Sophomores of the S/aience 
School were unable to keep a team 
in the tournament, and the Industry 
Plebes assumed the unplayed sched
ule. The newcomers lost their first 
game, but will probably hit their stride 
in the next, as they have good mater
ial.
Industries won from Design by a 
close score of 2 to 0. The Faculty 
walloped the T. A. C. bunch 29 to 9 in 
a sensationally hot game. Both the 
Plebe Science and Sigma Tau landed 
on the Woodlawn Club with heavy 
feet, the first winning  to 2, while 
the last score was 29 to 1. The crack 
Xi Sigma Upsilon five defeated Plebe 
Industries 14 to 8, and Plebe Science 
won from the Industries School 7 
to 2.
The standing of the teams is:

FACULTY VS. VARSITY.
Since the opening of the Inter-orj ganization basketball tournament, the 
j Faculty have gained the idea that they 
have some basketball team. Now they 
are willing to stack their players up 
agamst the team to which we pin our 
hopes, and being willing, have waxed 
hopeful of winning the contest on 
next Friday night, March 8. This 
game will not be a practice game for 
either team, but a regular hot fight. 
Now the students are given this 
chance to bawl out their favorite 
Prof. and must come out in force to 
drown out pedagogical rooters. Reg
ular admission will be charged, and 
the band will furnish music for the 
post-mortem dance.
The last game oi the season for

Allegheny College at the Field House

4THE TARTAN
 WHATS WHAT AND HOW. 
You are doubtless familiar with the 
touching moan of the muddy trail, 
that never touched the administration. 
Its reception by the authorities re
minds one of the story of the male
factor of great wealth, to whom seat
ed in the mahogany sanctuary of his 
private office and veiling his abdomi
nal magnificence from the plebean 
rabble without, came the frayed 
brother with the hard luck tale, hav
ing seduced the warder without the 
door. He detailed the resounding 
whacks dealt him by implacable for
tune and displayed his scars. The 
procession of his ills was more than 
a half hour passing a given point, and 
at the end the great mans eyes were 
wet. He reached over and touched 
the bell, and when his minion appeared 
he said to him in a choking voice, 
"Mike, throw this man out, hes 
breaking my heart.
This notorious trail is not unlike 
the road to righteousness; straight 
and beset with difficulties, but glorious 
at the end, for does not the School of 
Applied Domestic Bliss (flippantly 
known as the M. M. C.) pronounce 
the benediction to the Iliad of the 
muddy trail? And do not the 
muffled shrieks and the ravishing sil
houettes glimpsed thro the windows, 
make the unsophisticated male walk 
pigeon-toed with agitation, and give 
his rampant necktie a quick and fur
tive massage? The mysterious rites 
practiced within this shrine of the 
feminine are too subtle for our solid 
mahogany masculne wits, but we 
have our suspicions. There is 
the department of household arts for 
example. Its motto is without doubt, 
Feed the brute, and he will stand for 
anything. And to that end the prin
ciple adopted is that man shall not 
live by bread alone, he must have bis
cuit and buckwheat cakes now and 
then, and perchance his spirit should 
be chastened in unequal combat with 
a pie holding the championship in 
the heavyweight class. Herein are 
being perfected culinary conspiracies 
to grab the government by subsidiz
ing the masculine stomach. And then 
there is the ward wThere they culti
vate that harmless but costly form of 
insanity known as modern millinery, 
complicated with landscape gardening, 
horticulture and a bloodthirsty ornith
ology. There is nothing that would 
so inevitably fill a man chock full of 
awe, wonder, love and praise to his 
eyeballs as to see the companion of 
his joys, sorrows and expenses turn 
out unaided one of these breaches of 
the peace, that lovely woman spikes 
so nonchalantly to her dainty head. 
To entertain such vision even in his 
dreams mere man would consider a 
six weeks course in four-cylinder high
balls an indispensable preliminary.
And dresses! What unworthy male 
c<~>uld look unmoved on the spectacle 
of his domestic manager, palid with 
economical enthusiasm, from her own 
plans and specifications constructing 
a sartorial dream for seventy-five 
dollars, that she could have acquired 
in the regular way from a dressmaker 
for forty?
And the course in household econ
omics! A fascinating little game for 
winter evenings, these economie.:. 
They explain so charmingly why you 
are always in the hole, and banish 
forever from your soul the fear of 
dying rich.
And the gymnasium, where they 
are taught conversational ground and 
lofty tumbling, anti-wrinkle massage, 
the finer points of taming and hogtieing recalcitrant husbands and do
mestic jiu jitsu. They also play bas
ketball, it is said, and in the heat of 
battle have troubles with rats.
There is a rumor that the faculty 
was recently grappling with the ques
tion of inaugurating at least a hobble 
course in woman suffrage, when the 
vivacious professor of chemistry re
marked in the phlegmatic manner 
characteristic of him, name of a tri
color shirtwaist with a green cheval 
de frise! does not the woman already 
own the earth, why should she want 
to vote about it.
Nobody was prepared with the cor
rect answer and the discussion was 
abruptly diverted to doilies and jabots. 
As you passed this fortress of the 
feminine with burning blushes and 
conscious of three or four extra hands 
and feet, did you ever hear a buzzing 
sound like a truculent Rumkorff coil 
interrupted now and then by a ma
chine gun, well that was a Faculty 
meeting, addressed at intervals by the 
aforesaid P. of C.

CARNEGIE TECHNICAL SCHOOLS : PITTSBURGH
T
HE Carnegie Technical Schools consist of four 
separate schools, each with its own faculty, buildings 
and student body. The courses of instruction 
offered in these four schools differ widely.
School of Applied ScienceOffers courses in chemical, 
civil, electrical, commercial, mechanical, metallurgical, 
mining and sanitary engineering. 
School of Applied DesignOffers courses in architecture, 
interior decoration, illustration and painting, open to both 
men and women. 
School of Applied IndustriesOffers industrial courses in 
machine construction, building construction, and elec
trical equipment and installation. Short courses are offered 
in the various trades for applicants with experience. A 
new course to equip men as teachers in manual training 
and in trade school work is also offered. The increasing 
demand for such men provides an attractive field for the 
progressive young mechanic and the public school teacher 
Margaret Morrison Carnegie SchoolFor women only. 
Offers courses in household economics, secretarial work, 
dressmaking, and costume illustration and design. Be
cause of the demand for trained teachers, graduate courses 
are offered for those who wish to prepare for the many 
positions now open for women in these newer lines of work. 
Night CoursesThe four schools offer night courses in 
practically all of the above subjects to provide educational 
opportunities for those who are at work during the day.
