Poet W. H. Auden 
Reads W orks Here
Wystan Hugh Auden, one of the greatest literary fig
ures of our time, will read poetry selections in a program to 
be presented here on March 7 at 11:30 am in the Skibo Ball
room. All faculty, students, and staff are invited.
Audens program here is part 1
PoetW. HA uotd

of a six-week coast-to-coast tour 
that will take him to leading col
leges and before groups of poe
try lovers throughout this coun
try. While he has made several 
lecture tours, this will be his first 
extended tour devoted entirely 
tc poetry readings and brief com
mentary on the poems read. The 
poems presented in this program 
will include many of his own 
works, as well as those selected 
from various other poets of Eng
lish literature.
About the House is the title 
of his most recent volume of 
poetry. At least half of these 
poems are about the rooms in 
Mr. Audens house in Vienna. 
This book was published last 
year. In a review of About 
the House, G. S. Fraser in the 
New York Times has this to 
say of Audens position as a 
major poet of our time:
He is major in grasp and leap 
of his mind, its humane involve
mentserious, but never pom
pously solemn  combined with 
disinterested connectiveness. He 
fits not only objects and immedia
cies but ideas and stances, operational attitudes, into a poem 
as treated elements in a poem.
John Bayley, in the best short 
essay ever written on Auden, 
noted that the very poems which, 
in the 1930s, gained Auden a 
reputation as a committed, a so
cially realistic writer had, in fact, 
a mirror-like, Through-the-Look 
ing-Glass relationship to the ac
tual world of that time.
Audens World Separate
Fraser also points out that 
Auden has always moved in his 
own poetic world which has an 
asymptotic relationship (ap
proaching nearer and nearer 
tut never touching or identify
ing) with the real world. His 
pcems are, like an economists 
models of a growth situation or 
an imperfectly competitive socie(Continued on page 2)
Vietnam 
Ballot
A student-faculty referen
dum on issues concerning the 
war in Vietnam sponsored by 
the Tartan and Student Gov
ernment will be held Thurs
day and Friday. Two propos
ed resolutions and several 
basic questions about the Viet
namese war are printed on 
Page 5.
Polling booths located in 
Baker Hall and Skibo will have 
dittoed ballots containing the 
questions and appropriate box*s fof approval or disapproval. 
All students and faculty are 
eligible to vote in this refer
endum which is intended to 
ascertain student opinion on 
issues concerning the war in 
Vietnam.
The Spring Ball Committee last 
week selected The Les and Larry 
Elgart Band with Larry Elgart 
conducting to provide the music 
for the Spring Ball. Rather than

hold the traditional Military Ball 
as in the past, this year Carnegie 
Techs ROTC Honorary, Castle 
and Flag, is sponsoring an all
school formal to increase nonmilitary participation in the 
event. The Ball will be held Fri
day, April 7, in the ballroom of 
the Syria Mosque, More informa
tion concerning the Ball will be 
forthcoming in subsequent issues 
of the Tartan.
According to Gene Payne of the 
Sprmg Ball Committee, The El
gart Band was chosen because, as 
Downbeat so aptly put it, The 
Les and Larry Elgart Band goes 
beyond the usual criteria for 
dance bands. It has a fresh-sound
ing and imaginative look that 
places it into competition with 
top jazz crews for listening inter

Open House in the mens dormitories begins this Sun
day, when the dorms will be open to all visitors from 2 to 5 
pm. Tentatively, these open houses are to be held every 
other Sunday for the rest of the semester. They will be held 
in the undergraduate mens dorms only, and not in Morewood or the fraternity houses.
The open house policy was rePx.mrm HACWB

Proposals to alter present 
regulations concerning the 
times when women are per
mitted in fraternity houses 
are being presented by the 
Council of Fraternity Presi
dents to Techs Administra
tion.
CFP has proposed the elimin
ation of the old rule excluding 
women from fraternity houses be
tween 1 and 4:30 p.m.
Another more controversial 
proposal seeks to allow women 
in the houses until 11 pm on 
week nights. This proposal has 
already been amended to cov
er only three nights a week. 
This was done out of consider
ation for housemothers, who 
are required to be present when 
visitors are in their fraternity 
houses.
Under the present fraternity 
curfew rule, women must be out 
of fraternity houses by 7:30 pm 
on week-nigh ts.
The fundamental reason ad
vanced by CFP for extending 
womens time in fraternity houses 
is to make the houses more like 
homes for the men. These alter
ations would also provide a place 
for informal socializing and 
study-dates, activities which are 
presently restricted to the Tar
tan Grill and the Hunt Library.
However, it is felt by a few 
of the fraternity men that the 
extension of the evening curfew 
would place an undue burden on 
housemothers, and that the pres
ence of coeds might be too great 
a distraction from scholastic pur
suits.
Improved Post Office 
Set For April Opening
A new campus Post Office now under construction in 
Baker Hall is expected to be open by April 1. It is located 
on the ground floor, directly across the corridor from the 
Security Office. The removal of the Post Office from its 
present location will allow work to begin on expansion of
the Book Store.
Anarchy
Student anarchy and regulations 
in the University form the dis
cussion topic for todays meeting 
of the Critique of the University 
at 4:30 in Skibo 40.
Three student panelists and 
Dean of Student Affairs George 
K. Brown will present their views 
on the functions and purposes of 
student rules. The topic will then 
be opened for general comment. 
All interested members of the 
Carnegie Tech community are 
invited to attend.
The new postal facilities will 
provide three windows instead 
of the present two. During most 
of the year, the third window 
will be used for mail pickup, but 
it will also be used for the sale 
of stamps during the busy preChristmas season. The other win 
dows will take care of: (1) Par(Continued on Page 8)

vealed at last weeks meeting of 
Mens Dorm Council, when Earle 
Swank, Dean of Men, opened the 
meeting by announcing that We 
(members of the Administration) 
have agreed to try open houses 
on an experimental basis . . . this 
semester.
Swank stressed the experi
mental nature of the policy. 
The whole campus parietal 
privileges, he said, will prob
ably rise or fall on the suc
cess of this experiment.
Before Swanks statement, Mens 
Dorm Council had been planning 
to petition the Division of Stu
dent Affairs for open houses. Two 
weeks ago MDC polled dorm res
idents on open houses, and the 
response was 95 per cent in fav
or of them.
Counselors to Monitor
The open-door rule will pre
vail during open house: men with 
female visitors in their rooms 
will have to leave their doors 
open. Floor counselors will moni
tor the halls and enforce this 
rule.
Also, in presenting the open 
house statement, Dean Swank 
proposed that, instead of sched
uling blanket open houses in 
advance for the remainder of 
the year, the residents of each 
mens dorm should vote every 
two weeks on whether they 
want an open house on the 
forthcoming Sunday.
MDC has suggested a modifica
tion of this proposal. It has sug
gested that each dorm vote on 
open houses on a monthly basis, 
that these votes be taken two 
weeks before beginning of each 
month, and that a 60-40 majority 
must be obtained in a dorm if 
that dorm is to have open houses 
during the coming month. Thus, 
the men in Scobell might vote to 
have open houses in Scobell dur
ing the month of April while the 
men in Hammerschlag might vote 
against open houses in Hammer
schlag for April.
This plan would supposedly 
give dorm men a chance to de
cline open houses during a par
ticularly inopportune time, for 
instance during final exams.
Open houses in all dorms fcr 
the first and third Sundays in 
March are already definitely 
scheduled. MDC will serve cof(Continued on page 2)

Through The Looking Glass . ..
W. C. Fields: 
The Great Man
by Timothy Bay
Like the great movie comedians (Charles Chaplin, Harold Lloyd ) 
W. C. Fields throughout his films created a Comic Archetype whose 
character remained unvaried from film to film. With his bulbous nose, 
aristocratically tilted, his speech a beautiful mixture of pomposity and 
irrelevance, he remained throughout his film career an unsentimental 
misanthrope and anarchist.
A habitue of pool halls and bars, he waged constant warfare 
against such sturdy emblems of the Good American Life as dogs, 
children and marriage (Any man who hates Dogs and Children cant 
be all bad). Whether philosophizing (Chickens have pretty legs in 
Kansas) or lecturing on the evils of liquorThe Devils Brew 
Fields managed to bring to his subject a vast storehouse of preposter
ous misinformation and a fine surrealistic sense of humor. Although 
his lines are not found in Bartletts book of Quotations, his better ones 
have achieved an immortality beyond their particular movie. For in
stance, his definition of a Virgin A twelve year old girl, very ugly, 
of his surefire cure for insomnia, Get plenty of Sleep.
The amazing and to me gratifying thing about Fields was that, 
as Robert Lewis Taylor shows in his book W.C. Fields: His Follies and 
Fortunes, the character created by Fields on screen was remarkably 
similar to his off-screen one. This book, now a signet paperback, is a 
fine recollection of this remarkable individualist. Besides the great in
herent humor of its subject, Taylor, a New Yorker writer, has written 
it in a colorful journalistic style, and with great understanding.
Fields wrote the screenplays for several of his movies under 
such absurd aliases as Otis CriblecoblesiNever Give a Sucker an Even 
Break), Mahatma Kane Jeevies (Bank Dick) and Charles Bogle (You 
Cant Cheat an Honest Man). In retrospect, most of them are little 
more than vehicles for Fields freewheeling humor. His dictatorial 
manner and unorthodox approach to comedy drove directors, pro
ducers, censors and eventually three quarters of Hollywood mad.
Typical of this was his battle with Universal Studios over the 
title of Never Give a Sucker an Even Break. Fields with his usual mod
esty wanted the picture to be called simply The Great Man. After his 
title was turned down, Fields snarled: What does it matter; they 
cant get that on a marquee. It will probably boil down to FieldsSucker.
Fields dislike of children was notorious; he declared that when 
he went to the country fair with his young niece, he parked the little 
girl in the shooting gallery. One of Fields few straight roles was as 
Micauber in the Metro Goldwyn Mayor production of David Copperfield. Fields enthusiastically accepted the role with one condition; that 
as Micauber he could trot out his classic vaudeville juggling routine. 
The studio heads somehow took rather unkindly to Fields idea; One 
o them told Fields coldly Dickens made no mention of juggling in 
David Copperfield.
He probably forgot about it, Fields replied. Even after d-'dth, 
Fields managed to thumb his nose at the world. After his death 
ironically on Christmas day 1946there arose the matter of a will. A 
suspicious cynic and individualist to the end, Fields had deposited his 
vast earnings in a great number of banks over the world under various 
aliases. To this day, most of his money has remained undiscovex-ed.
This biography does perfect justice to the magnificent frauds 
perpetrated by this truly funny man.

movies ever made, will be shown this Friday at the Cine Y series,

Editorials
Infantile Tendencies
While many students have complained about the ap
pearance of the snack bar, a major problem exists in the 
general cleanliness of the snack bar area. Although the 
snack bar staff is responsible for cleaning up the eating 
areas, they certainly cannot cope with the extraordinary 
filth now prevalent, especially on the mezzanine. It is ap
parent that the problem is not lack of snack bar person
nel, but is caused by the general sloppiness and lack of 
consideration of many snack bar patrons.
Some students must think it in to leave tables clut
tered with many pieces of plastic cup, cigarette ashes and 
butts, torn-up napkins, and other remnants of infantile ten
dencies to break things into small pieces. Not only is this 
action childish, but it is completely inconsiderate of others 
who wish to use the facilities after these students leave.
If students using snack bar would channel some of the 
thought and energy expended in covering the tables with a 
layer of assorted debris into removing all cups, napkins and 
paper plates and placing them in trash receptacles, the ap
pearance and pleasantness of the snack bar would be en
hanced.
A Caveat
The incident last week at Colonial Manor, when quick 
action by the Security Police prevented what could have 
been a serious occurrence, serves to emphasize the necessity 
for security measures.
While dormitory and living areas are always prone to 
theft or vandalism, the number of these occurrences has 
been minimal in the past, due in part to the conscientious
ness of the occupants and to patrolling by campus police. 
However, recent cases of vandalism, and this most decent 
occurrence in the Colonial Manor area indicate that there is 
a need for more precautions.
Undoubtedly, the intruder last week would have been 
foiled by a closed, locked front door, which is the respon
sibility of those entering or leaving the buildings. Many 
times, the doors are left ajar, which provides easy access 
for visitors, but unfortunately, leaves the units equally ac
cessible to unwanted intruders.
Since Colonial Manor is on the edge of the campus, and 
is located in heavily-traveled Fifth Avenue, the usual se
curity measures used elsewhere on campus are not suf
ficient. The recent cases of vandalism in the area may 
have been averted by the presence of campus police. While 
it is impractical to actually station a campus patrolman in 
the area, an increase in the frequency of patrols would 
serve the same end.
It may be too melodramatic, or a case of over-em
phasizing a point, but the example of the killing of eight 
student nurses in Chicago shows that an incident can 
become tragic. Since apartment living presupposes respon
sibility on the part of the students, the neglect of simple 
security measudes is an irony which must be avoided here
after.

A Vote For 
Lawrence
Editor, The Tartan:
In regard to last weeks issue 
I guess there is an easy explan
ation for the errors in Mr. Law
rences column, errors that may 
v/ell have been beyond his con
trol.
The point is that there is an 
old saying: When all else fails, 
it is easy to be punitive. I have 
read Mr. Lawrences columns 
since he began as a columnist last 
semester. I believe he began his 
writing with you with a re
view of The Corn is Green.
Messrs. Gallagher and Elliott 
are right: Bosley Crowther he is 
not; however, I find that his 
writing is sort of an extremely 
pleasant cross between Time and 
The New Yorker, a cross that is 
very, very good, and most re
freshing, seeing as how many of 
your columnists write and write 
and say nothing. He at least 
makes a commitment in his re
views and sticks to it.
Also, his writing is diversified 
so that he does not fall into the 
xut of nothing but movie criti
cism. I, for one, immensely en
joyed his column about Nina Si
mone album and the soundtrack 
from A Man And A Woman. This 
to me is the purpose of a colum
nist and he serves that purpose 
well.
I sincerely hope you do keep 
him on and that he continues in 
the same way.
Good luck to you all, and my 
most sincere best wishes to Mr. 
Lawrence.

Gargoyles 
For Grill
Editor, The Tartan:
As president of one of the 
lesser known organizations on 
campus, The Gargoyle Watching 
Society (we receive funds from 
neither Student Congress nor the
C.I.A.), I would like to offer my 
help to the Student Congress 
Committee for Renovation and 
Preservation (C.R.A.P.), which is 
presently concerned with our 
marvelous Tartan Brill (snack 
bar).
They must be saving the lowest 
level of the Grill for some
thing really special. If not they 
would surely have put tables 
there which would have increas
ed the capacity of the Grill 
quite a bit. But who wants more 
room to sit and talk and have 
fun? It is much better to wait 
for something really great to be 
put there. After all, wasnt it 
worth waiting a couple months 
for the new Tartan Grill?
If the committee is interested 
I am willing to make arrange
ments for an exhibit of the great
gargoyles of the world to be put 
on display in the lowest level of 
the snack bar. I am sure it would 
be of great interest to the stu
dent body, and it would give 
them something to do while they 
were waiting for a table.
K. A. Neal, Oberwitzbold 
Die Wasserspiersbeobachtersgesellshaft
(Editors Note: The Student Un
ion Committee, misnomered C.R.- 
A.P. by Mr. Neal, is now receiv
ing several proposals for the low
er level of the snack bar. These 
include curtains, benches, more 
eating tables, and a television 
room. But no gargoyles.)
Former Worker 
Attacks WRCT
Editor, the Tartan:
Ideally a campus radio station 
would supply unique programs 
which cannot be heard elsewhere. 
WRCTs present programming 
policy consists of music shows 
which can be obtained, in much 
better quality, on commercial 
Pittsburgh stations. What could 
be a dynamic, exciting and uniquely Tech station, has become 
a poor imitation of KQV, WTAE, 
etc.
If programming were predom
inated by talk shows, i.e. panels, 
faculty discussions, comedy, out
standing personalities of the Pitts
burgh area, etc., WRCT would 
be a station worth listening to, a 
station commanding the interest 
of the Tech student body. The 
excuses put forth by the present 
staff of WRCT about lack of funds 
and staff could be overcome if a 
new constitution and management 
were established, a management 
who could devise an exciting and 
worthwhile format. The money 
needed is available, but it wont 
be budgeted for WRCT until 
WRCT proves it merits greater 
financial support from the school. 
As for lack of staff, there are 
many capable and willing people 
on this campus who would join 
in the stations efforts, if they 
could be shown a station with 
potential, rather than a station 
being used as a toy by its staff.
Barry W. Cornets proposal that 
the T.P.s on campus temporarily 
take over the engineering of the 
station until it gets back on its 
feet is an excellent one. These 
people would be interested in 
broadcasting good quality pro
grams, rather than being interest
ed in playing with machines.
It is time some drastic action, 
such as Barry has proposed, be 
taken to correct the deplorable 
condition of WRCT.

President H. Guyford Stev
er discussed academic 
strength, physical facilities, 
and student involvement in 
a talk on Carnegie Univer
sity last Tuesday in the 
Skibo Ballroom.
President Stever told a lunch
time audience of about 200 stu
dents that there is no reason ... 
we wont be Carnegie University 
on June 30 of this year. He ad
mitted, however, that he cant 
answer when the new College of 
Humanities and Social Sciences 
will begin granting Bachelor of 
Arts degrees.
Stever noted that because of 
its development as a support
ing division, H&SS has not 
developed as fully as it might." 
As we acquire capabilities, 
he said, we will move in with 
it (the H&SS college) . . . but 
acquiring capabilities means 
acquiring resources.
Reviewing the other colleges, 
Stever called Engineering and 
Science, Industrial Administra
tion, and Fine Arts extremely 
developed professional fields, 
and added that he did not think 
a strong professional focus is 
harmful to students. He said it 
creates a degree of intensity 
about undergraduate life, and 
this is good.
He talked briefly about grad
uate school at Carnegie Universi
ty presumably referring to the 
new grad possibilities created by 
the Mellon merger and the be
ginning of the Carnegie Educa
tion Center. A lot of people wor
ry that introduction of this (grad 
work) will interfere with under
graduate education ... the fact is, 
undergraduate education would 
not be as good if we did not 
build graduate education.
Physict Needs
In his discussion of the physi
cal state of the campus, Stever 
said, he thought womens hous
ing and fraternity housing were 
pretty good, but mens housing 
leaves much to be desired.
He warned, however, that liv
ing facilities dont rate the high
est priority . . . the most impor
tant thing is just plain better ed
ucation.
In Skibo, according to Stever, 
there is the problem of really 
adding substantially to the facil
ities.
He stressed the need for a 
dramatic arts center and a Fine 
Arts complex: 'facilities in Fine 
Arts have not kept up with the 
quality of the school . . . its 
hard to keep up in this field 
.. . the fine arts do not produce 
money and they do not stir 
people who do produce mon
ey.
Also on Stevers schedule for 
campus improvement are a re
search center, more parking space, 
a new field house and gym, and 
an infirmary including psychi(Continued on page 6)

CampusBallotingConsidersVietnamldeas
The first of the following two 
proposals submitted by James 
Coyne, chem '69, of the Tech 
Young Americans for Freedom 
group, is in support of the pres
ent U.S. Vietnam policy. The 
second is a declaration drawn 
up by several students at the 
Cornell Conference on Viet
nam. Although this was not 
the majority resolution of the 
conference, it is an example of 
opposition to the current U.S. 
policy.
The questions following the 
proposals focus on several spe
cific issues of the war.
In the balloting, students and 
faculty will be able to indicate 
their support or opposition to the 
two proposals and their answers 
to the questions listed below. The 
balloting will be conducted
Thursday and Friday in 
Baker Hall and Skibo.Ed.
U.R. gCB. Rmmk 
Vsm.rtl Vs?.AWd
If the Communists are success
ful in Vietnam, the chances of 
more extensive wars will be in
creased. All of Southeast Asia will 
be threatened with so-called wars 
of liberation. The impression 
will be given that the United 
States is weak or irresolute 
enough to retreat when confront
ed with a determined revolution
ary military force. Nothing 
would be more certain to heighten 
the possibility of World War III 
and worldwide disaster. In the 
interest of enduring world peace, 
we must defeat the Communists 
in South Vietnam.
Obligation to Support Troops
In defense of South Vietnam, 
the United States has sent hun
dreds of thousands of troops with 
several hundred thousand more 
to join them in ensuing months. 
The President of the United States 
has a moral obligation to give un
limited support to our fighting 
men. It is immoral to reject vic
tory when American lives are 
committed to fighting a war. It 
is immoral to refuse victory to 
an ally in its struggle to remain 
free from totalitarian domination 
and perhaps keep its citizens from 
concentration camps, or worse.
No final solution to the war 
in Vietnam will be found in the 
unconditional negotiations 
which the present administra
tion has set as its goal. World 
peace will not be guaranteed 
by such action. Indeed, world 
peace will be weakened by un
conditional negotiations*' with 
the Communists in Vietnam.
Our goal in Vietnam must be 
Peace through victory. Severely 
limited response, as ours has been 
in Vietnam, conciliates the enemy 
at the expense of our own forces 
and results in enlargement of the 
aggression. World peace can 
only be achieved when aggression 
has been discouraged.
Three Point Program 
Advocated
We advocate the pursuit of vic
tory on three fronts  diplomatic, 
economic and militaryand urge 
the following steps towards a goal 
of victory in Vietnam:
Diplomatic: The simple act of 
bating a firm policy of victorv is 
the first and most important step
in establishing diplomatic unity of 
the free nations in Europe, Afri
ca, and South America as a solid 
barrier to communism all over 
the world. The President of the 
United States must make it crys
tal clear that the free world in
tends to achieve peace through 
victory in the Vietnam war. Such 
a statement should be made im
mediately.
Economic: The immense eco
nomic power of the United States 
must be employed so as to dis
courage other nations from trading with North Vietnam. Eco
nomic pressures should be used to 
restrain our so-called allies who 
are presently trading with our 
North Vietnamese enemy.
Military: American lives are 
committed in this struggle. Their 
Commander-in-Chief, their Presi
dent, must support our fighting 
men to the utmost capacity and 
achieve victory.
All military targets in North 
Vietnam should be available for 
military attack. These include con
trol centers, air fields, electrical 
power installations, factories, ma
jor supply-storage areas, irriga
tion systems, principal transpor
tation centers, and harbor facil
ities. Civilian populations in these 
areas can be forewarned and thus 
little, if any, civilian casualities.
Privileged sanctuary must be 
denied the enemy. Our air forces 
must be free to execute the most 
efficient possible destruction of 
military targets in Laos, Cambo
dia and North Vietnam.
The sea routes by which the 
North Vietnamese forces in South 
Vietnam are supplied must be 
closed. It is criminal folly to re
quire our infantrymen to meet in 
the jungles of South Vietnam ene
my forces and materiel which 
could have been excluded from 
the war zone by our superior sea 
and air forces.
Victory Eessential 
To Prevention of WW m
Unless the United States and 
free Asian countries win a clear 
victory in this war, the Pacific 
rim will fall to communism. If this 
should happen, then a third world 
war becomes a greater possibility.
Morally and strategically, we 
cannot abandon the people of 
South Vietnam to the Communists. 
A prosperous economic and poli? 
tical future will be assured for 
South Vietnam when the Presi
dent of the United States declares 
that victory is our goal. The 
American people have already 
made their decision.
It is clear, therefore, that peace 
is attainable only through Victory 
in Vietnam. We pledge our full 
support to that cause. We invite 
all Americans to join us in urging 
this essentially new direction to 
the United States policy in South
east Asia.
kCWmr Af umt?m 
RmB.B ws.h U.R.
We believe we represent a large 
and growing segment of Amer
ican students with grave concern 
for American policy in Vietnam.
We believe that because of the 
crusading rhetoric of the Cold 
War, misapprehension of the 
changing nature of world com
munism, and the failure to per
ceive clearly the character of so
cial change in the underveloped 
world, the United States is now 
pursuing a rigid foreign policy 
in conditions of inevitable flux. 
The nexus of these failures has 
obscured our humanitarian ideals 
and has led us to moral hypo
crisy and potential political dis
aster in Vietnam.
The United States aided French 
colonialists against a popular Viet
namese nationalist movement un
til 1954. The United States sup
ported a regime in South Vietnam 
which eventually became tyran
nical and alienated large numbers 
of the Vietnamese people. Misun
derstanding of the relationships 
between North Vietnam and the 
Peoples Republic of China, and 
between North Vietnam and the 
National Liberation Front, has led 
us to escalate our involvement 
to the present inhuman warfare.
In pursuing this war we have 
sanctioned and actively engaged 
in the use of terrible weapons, 
like the numerous antipersonnel 
bombs dropped on North Vietnam, 
and often indiscriminate bombing, 
shelling and napalming in the 
South. Our own citizens are dying. 
To maintain an increasing war 
effort, the United States is forced 
to throttle disastrously her domes
tic reform programs. The United 
States is branded an aggressor 
throughout the world.
After fully acknowledging the 
complexity of situations the ad
ministration has faced, and the 
excruciating decisions it has 
made, we can see little hope in 
this countrys present seeming
ly inflexible policy.
We worry about the wars prob
able length and cost, but we wor
ry most deeply about holocaust 
through further escalation to gen
eral war.
Our goal for South Vietnam is 
immediate end to hostilities and 
self-determination for the South 
Vietnamese people. The condi 
tions for self-determination pre
clude influence of outside power. 
A realistic implementation of 
these goals will mean basic re
vision of United States policy in 
Southeast Asia. We recognize that 
the United States does not have 
the right to interfere in the poli
tical self-determination of inde
pendent peoples.
We urge immediate imple
mentation of the following poli
cy:
1. The United States should 
promptly cease bombing in 
Vietnam. No new forces should 
be added in South Vietnam. Mil
itary operations should be halt
ed, with the sole exception of 
defensive actions.
2. The South Vietnamese govern
ment should establish an im
mediate temporary ceasefire 
with the National Liberation 
Front. To permit initiation of 
actual peace negotiations, the 
U.S. should immediately com
mence a partial withdrawal.
3. At the same time, the United 
States and South Vietnam 
should propose negotiations be
tween military representatives 
of the United States, South Viet
nam, North Vietnam, and the 
National Liberation Front.
4 As a negotiating position the 
United States should pledge 
complete removal of its forces 
from Vietnam.
5. These negotiations between the 
United States, South Vietnam 
(the delegates from South Viet
nam should represent old fac
tions) North Vietnam, and the 
NLF should be aimed at a per
manent ceasefire and plans for 
self-determination in South Viet
nam. Because of our unfortunate 
and extensive involvement in 
Vietnam, realistically the United 
States must take part in these 
negotiations. However, the Unit
ed States must not use its in
fluence to secure the establish
ment of any interim govern
ment necessarily favorable to 
its policies. Rather, our goal 
should be an interim coalition 
government which will lay the 
groundwork for peaceful politi
cal expression by the people of 
South Vietnam. At this time the 
representatives of the NLF and 
the existing South Vietnamese 
government shall determine a 
date for the termination of the 
interim government by general 
elections.
6. An international conference 
should be convened to guarantee 
the military arrangements made 
by the belligerents and to in
sure there will be no interven
tion by outside powers regard
less of the decision of referen
dum. Britain and the Soviet 
Union should jointly chair this 
conference. The Peoples Repub
lic of China, Japan, the nations 
of Southeast Asia, representa
tives of the interim coalition 
government and the United 
States should be members of the 
conference, and must draw up 
a time table for this withdraw
al to be implemented. This in
ternational control commission 
will supervise this withdrawal 
immediately upon establishment 
of the interim government.
7. In addition to (6) the interna
tional conference should mili
tarily neutralize South Vietnam 
and negotiate a multilateral 
agreement for the general mili
tary neutralization of South
east Asia.
WE FEEL THAT THE UNIT
ED STATES HAS THE MAJOR 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR TERM
INATING THIS WAR, and thus 
we propose an eighth point: that 
our administration initiate and en
courage wider and more flexible 
contingency planning in the spirit 
of the above proposals for nego
tiated conditions which will al
low self-determination in South 
Vietnam. This planning should be 
done by top analysts and agen
cies. We further recognize that 
these plans are meaningless until the United States makes the 
basic decision to accept a com
promise settlement in Vietnam.

Police Arrest 
Colonial Prowler
Early Saturday morning two 
Tech security policemen appre
hended a prowler who had tried 
to break into a first-floor apart
ment at Colonial Manor.
The prowler, a large man about 
30 years old, was not identified 
by the security police. He enter
ed Colonial Manor about 4:30 am 
Saturday through the front door, 
which had not been shut tight. 
He then pounded on the door of 
Apartment 14, occupied by Mau
reen Uffer, Margaret Mac Arthur, 
and Mary Friede, drama students.
Miss Friede was away for the 
weekend, but the other two girls 
were aroused by the pounding 
and asked the prowler to identify 
himself. He said he was An
gelo, and when that failed to pro
duce results, said he was a cam
pus cop.
Miss MacArthur opened the 
door, but left the chain latch on. 
When the prowler tried to push 
the door open, the two girls push
ed back and caught his coat 
sleeve in the door.
The prowler managed to free 
himself and fled, but did not get 
far. The girls immediately called 
the security man at the Morewood 
desk, who alerted the security 
prowl car.
While one security policeman 
was at the apartment questioning 
the girls, another policeman in 
the prowl car spotted the prowler 
roaming the streets, picked him 
up, and brought him back to the 
apartment, where he was identi
fied. He was then turned over to 
the Pittsburgh police.
Said Miss MacArthur, The Bos
ton Strangler was on the loose 
then, so you can imagine how I 
felt. I heard he might have es
caped to the Pittsburgh area. 
When that man started beating 
on the door . .
AWS Elections, 
Room Drawings 
Set At Meeting
Officers of the Association 
oi: Women Students for the 
1967-68 school year will be 
elected April 3 and 4. Mari
lyn Blitz, current president 
of AWS, announced the elec
tion dates at last weeks 
meeting.
She added that Morewood floor 
counselors will be selected on 
April 7, with room drawings fol
lowing shortly after. In orde: to 
be eligible to draw for a room 
next year, each woman student 
must submit a card, accompanied 
bv $50 dollars to Dean Milligans 
cffice by March 31.
Price Talks About Food
L. E. Price, Director of Food 
Service, also made an appearance 
at the AWS meeting. In reply to 
complaints about the use of pa
per plates in Morewood, he prom
ised they would not be used for 
dinner any more.
Price said he believes most of 
the complaints about food serv
ice arise from the selection of 
food rather than its preparation. 
He expressed a desire to get this 
difficulty under control through 
the Food Service Committee.
Eventually, Price hopes to have 
Morewood cafeteria handle break
fast only, and have all other wom
en's meals served at Skibo. This 
procedure, he says would be more 
economical, and both the food 
and operation would improve.
Cosmetic Sales
As its final order of business 
last week, AWS heard a repre
sentative of a cosmetics firm 
looking for on-campus saleswom
en. It was decided that any girl 
who wants to sell cosmetics in 
the dorms must petition AWS for 
permission.

cel Post and Stamps, and (2) 
Registry, Money Orders, and 
Stamps, respectively. A separate 
dutch-window door will be avail
able for receiving outgoing large 
mailings.
All-new Post Office boxes 
will be available to any stu
dent, faculty or staff member, 
or campus organization. There 
will be 168 of the standard 
size, 16 double size and eight 
triple size boxes. The lowest 
boxes will be 20 inches from 
the floor, so as to be more ac
cessible than the present large 
boxes. Provision is built-in for 
additional boxes to be added 
later, if there is a need.
The new boxes will be number
ed 100 thru 267, numbers be
low 100 being reserved for the 
oversized boxes. Because of the 
fewer number of boxes available 
and new numbering scheme, the 
Post Office will be unable to con
tinue the same box number for 
etch of its present patrons; how
ever, the majority will not be 
affected.
Efficiency Improves
Behind the scenes, the change 
will be even greater. A loading 
dock for mail trucks is located 
at one corner of the Frew street 
parking lot with a ramp to sidewalk level. The loading dock 
opens into a receiving room, so 
that the cold air and dirt from 
the outside will be isolated. The 
work areas inside are airconditioned for efficiency in the sum
mer months.
The additional space is expect
ed. to permit more flexibility and 
efficiency in the sorting area and 
a long-needed separate office for 
the Postmistress.
Also, the postage meter ma
chine will have its own room, 
so that its clatter will be some
what isolated from the Post Of
fice proper. J. D. Sands, Director 
of Purchasing, says, All in a 11, it 
will be more pleasant and effi
cient arrangement, not only for 
the Post Office employees, but 
also for its patrons.

Anthone Review
Killing of Sister George 
and a Reply
by Tony Lawrence {
I would first like to take this opportunity to answer the two 
letters which appeared in last weeks Tartan. In short, both the proof
reader and the typesetter had a ball with the copy for my column 
two weeks ago. Consequently, many of the things I wrote were 
changed. According to my original copy which was submitted, I said 
that The Caine Mutiny was one of Bogarts last filmsnot his last 
film. If it is considered how many films Humphrey did make, then 
The Caine Mutiny can certainly be considered as one of his last films.
Concerning the letter from Jeff Begun: a) I said that the undert 
ground film activity began last semester. The word summer was 
a misprint, b) I also said that the showing was held on a Wednesday.
It was written in on a crossed out Thursday, therefore, the type
setter seems to have ignored it. c) My question still standsWhat is 
an underground film? d) I ami guilty of saying that five of the 
films wei'e not shown instead of three. Im pleased that Eaux D'artifice 
was moved up from the April showing, and that it was gotten out of 
the way early. It is still an unforgettable bore, e) If Mr. Begun and 
his group only had 200 posters to give away at the door, then Im 
afraid their planning was a bit faulty. Easily three times as many 
people saw the films, f) I wasnt criticizing the reshowing of Oh < 
Detn Watermelons. The film didnt appear to hold up as well the sec
ond time around. Im pleased as pumpkins that Mr. Begun has seen 
Oh Dem Watermelons 15 times, but Im sure hes in the minority 
this time. If the underground film activity is to become a regular 
event on campus, then why not try and get things in shape a little bet
ter? What about selling tickets in advance, much like Film Arts So
ciety does? Right now getting in to see them is like riding the sub
way during the rush hour.
(oh well, on to bigger and better things)

One of the high-water marks in my recent trip to New York was 
seeing THE KILLING OF SISTER GEORGE, the new play by Frank 
Marcus is about an actress named June Buckeridge who portrays a 
nurse called Sister George on a daytime soap opera. Miss Buckeridge 
is also a Lesbian, and, when she is accused of trying to assault three 
nuns in a taxi, the producers decide that the only facesavinfg; way 
out is to have Sister George killed off. Residing in the apartment 
with June is her young lover who is forced to drink Miss Buckeridges dirty bath water and eat her old cigar butts. In the end, June 
loses the girl to another woman and must face the future all alone. 
Her only consolation is that she could have had a job as a cow on a * 
childrens showing doing nothing but an occasional Mo-o-o.
What made the experience even greater was going backstage 
afterwards and talking with Beryl Reid who plays June Buckeridge. 
Killing Of Sister George is Miss Reids first straight dramatic role 
(though the play is called a comedy), and her performance is mag
nificent. Miss Reid and I talked of the following:
Q: Miss Reid, I must say I find it hard to believe that this is your 
first real dramatic part, the reason being that everything about 
your performance had the touch of a seasoned actressa great one 
at that. What difficulties did you find, if any, in making the trans1 
ition from the music hall, vaudeville type of entertaining that you 
were known for to the part of June Buckeridge?
A: I had quite a few difficulties. The fact that I overcame them is 
due to our brilliant director (Val May). His patience with me was 
inexhaustible, and he spent day after day working with just me. He 
did, however, allow a mutual creative process to occur, a process 
that I personally feel is vital to a plays success.
Q: What important failing have you noticed among some of the young 
actors both in America and in England? Im speaking more in terms 
of the technical aspect rather than something like talent, spark, 
etc, etc. . .
A: Im quite surprised at the way many young people talk on the 
stage. Many of them cannot be heard. The ones that can be heard 
often cant be understood. Speech is vitally imporant, and Ive al
ways thought that if you cant be heard and understood beyond 
the first five rows, you might as well be doing it in the bathroom.
Q: Do you find much difference in American audiences and European 
audiences as far as how receptive they are towards the play and 
its content? *
A: I really couldnt tell the difference until I was taking a cab to j 
the theatre one night. When I got out, the driver turned to me and 
saw the advertisements in front of the theatre and said May I 
kiss you on the cheek? Ive never kissed a lesbian. I like to think 
that The Killing Of Sister George is more about people than just 
about lesbians.
There must still be a prevailing idea among people that Lesbians 
are monsters with horns. I feel that the way Frank Marcus has used 
the theme of lesbianism in the play makes it a great play.
I couldnt have agreed with Miss Reid more. The play is called a 
comedy. I assure you there is very little to laugh at in it. The entire 
cast is excellent, and I was pleased to see that Polly Rowles, who * 
plays Madame Xeniaa sort of friend, confidantis a graduate of 
the Drama Department at Carnegie Tech. Anyone going to New York 
soon would do extremely well to stop by the Belasco Theatre and see 
The Killing Of Sister George.
* * * * * *
After becoming rather pessimistic about the theatrical ac
tivities at the University of Pittsburgh, it was extremely pleasing 
to at last see something worthwhile there. The offering was Krapps 
Last Tape by Samuel Beckett. The direction, acting, and design was 
by John Krich (who played a superb Bosola in last semesters DUCH
ESS OF MALFI) who alone made the evening well spent. Mr. Krich is 
excellent in this one hour solo performance. Two examples of his fine 
ability as an actor are both his consistent characterization, and his 
movement, though precise, is both terribly natural and real. Krapps 
Last Tape takes place in a room where an old man is sitting alone 
with a tape recorder and a vast amount of tape.

When the ace of clubs was led, 
East was confronted with a 
choice of discards. He was afraid 
to let go of his queen of dia
monds, because the ten could be 
established via a ruff by South. 
East had no way of knowing that 
such a ruff would leave West 
with the only remaining trump. 
Thus Easts difficult decision be
came a heart choice. South cash
ed the ace of hearts, returned to 
hi? hand with the king, drew 
the outstanding trump and cash
ed the six of hearts for his slamfulfilling trick.

MECHANICAL ENGINEER SENIORS!
(Where do you think you're going?)
ARE YOU GOING TO A WELL-PAID JOB
to start your post-grad career?
WANT RAPID ADVANCEMENT? Assumption of Big Responsibility early in life? And, at the same time, 
do you want to join a company having interest in your individual welfare and security.
If you are interested in a dynamic, rapidly-paced industry, then perhaps Limbach Company in the 
Mechanical Construction field is the answer to your career goals.
With headquarters and one of our four shops right here in Pittsburgh, Limbach is nationally known. 
We have more than doubled our size in the past seven years, offering speedy growth to the men who 
have joined our engineering forces. Big enough to provide opportunity, we are still small enough* to 
permit your worth to show.
Each year a few engineers graduating with mechanical (or civil) degrees join our Engineer-In-Training 
Program. Over a three-year period of intensive on-the-job training, work and earning, our men learn 
this rewarding business*. Technical, Administrative and, eventually. Supervising Management positions 
are our goal for such Engineers.
Are they YOUR goals?
Should we get together?

About 225 white collar employees (including Engineers) do a $40,000,000 annual volume.
Like being an engineer anywhere else, youre saying.
Well . . . yes, and no.
Procter & Gamble is a remarkably stable company, and technical employment just doesnt 
fluctuate. P&G engineers dont worry about shutdowns or layoffs.
And P&G puts more than a little emphasis on the creative aspects of engineeringthe 
solving of problems by men encouraged to use their own initiative to "find a different way. 
P&G takes special care of its new engineers, too. They are selected with care from among 
each years crop of graduates, and every effort is made to assign each man to a project in 
the area that interests him most.
Projects of considerable responsibility are assigned each individual early in his career, 
and, assisted by planned personal coaching at first, it is not unusual for an engineer after 
six months to be responsible for the design and development of equipment in the million 
dollar range.
This strong beginning leads to advancement in a relatively short time, and our engineers 
tell us it is invaluable.
It is invaluable to the Company, too, and most necessary with the heavy engineering load 
to which we are committed.

Last weeks basketball action saw Carnegie Techs quin
tet revenge an earlier 10 point loss to Geneva 72-65, lose to 
St. Vincent 79-71 although C.I.T. had won an earlier game 
with the Bearcats, and win over Western Reserve 89-69. 
Mark Lane paced all three games for the Tartans as high 
scorer and rebounder, but much of the credit for the two 
wins goes to Ray Burdett, Don Keefer, and Jeff Kalin, all of 
whom were in double figures for each of the three games. 
Leigh DeHuff started his first 
two games against Geneva and 
Western Reserve, and showed 
that he could be an invaluable 
ball-handling asset as well as a 
good scorer: he averaged 10
points per game.
Skibos Upset Geneva
When Geneva was upset at Skibo gym, Tech used a slow,, deli
berate offense that was to keep 
Genevas good outside men from 
getting away their customary 70 
or 80 shots. Tech took an early 
19-9 lead in the first half; and 
Genevas men were shooting 
enough, but their shots were in 
and not as accurate as usual.
Techs offense then played a holdthe-ball game until Genevas zone 
came far outside to get them, 
then passed to Kalin or Lang for 
the easy inside bucket. The re
sults were spectacular. Techs 
fieldgoal percentage was 55.1;
Genevas sharpshooters, Ray Hoppa and Donnie Sheffield were 
rushing their shots in order to 
close the gap  only late in the 
game did they begin to hit, and 
then it was too late.
John Meister played an excel
lent defensive game; he replaced 
Ray Burdett when Rays reputa
tion (and not his action on the 
court) cost him two of four per
sonals in the first four minutes.
The combination of DeHuff and 
Meister was the one which ena
bled the CIT big inside men to 
get the easy shots, resulting in 
revenge for the CIT team.

Tech Outshoots Red Cats 
Against Western Reserve the 
Tartans took an early lead of 10-2, 
but with still six minutes in the 
first half remaining, the Western 
Reserve Red Cats had tied the 
score at 24 all. From then until 
only 12:37 remained, the lead 
changed hands nine times. At that 
moment, Jeff Kalin hit two shots 
from the free throw line to give 
CIT a lead they never lost 57-55. 
But the deciding factor in the 
game was fouls. In the second half 
alone, the Tartan starters sunk 
16 out of 18 free throws; Western 
Reserve only hit on 5 of 10 in the 
entire game. Time was the dif
ferenceboth Ron Stunz and Jeff 
Borer had fouls on them in the 
late minutes of the second half. 
After Kalin had hit the two free 
throws, Don Keefer suddenly be
came hot and scored seven points 
out of nine of CIT in the next four 
minutes to make the score 66-61. 
Down by five points, with only six 
minutes to play, the Western Re
serve men were forced to come 
after the ball, which put them 
wide open for short buckets as 
CIT had done against Geneva. 
Lang, Burdett, and Kalin kept 
popping them in until the lead was - 
increased to 20 points at the buz
zer.
Late in the first half, too many 
errant passes cost CIT a chance 
to get the lead earlier. John Meis
ter and Barry Hummel were 
placed in the Tech lineup, and 
kept the CIT team in then for the 
last few minutes of the half with 
six points Mark Lang, Ray Bur
dett and Jeff Kalin each scored 
better than any of their oppon
ents and Don Keefer and Leight 
DeHuff each had 13.

Tartan Swimmers Capture 
Seventh Straight Victory
by Larry Anderson
The swimming team had a taste of defeat at the begin
ning of the season (three straight losses) but apparently 
didnt enjoy it as they have since splashed their opponents 
seven straight times. The last two times were victories over 
Slippery Rock (63-32) and Case Tech (65-30) making their 
overall record 7-3, and thus assuring them of a winning sea 
son.
Captain Pete Hutter and Mer
rill Motor dominated their Slip
pery Rock opponents as both had 
two first places in the freestyle 
events. John Bennett, Bill Cotsworth, and Fred Rial followed 
suit to lead their respective div
ing, 200-yard backstroke events. 
The final blow dealt to Slippery 
Rock was a first place finish by 
the 400-yard relay team of Jim 
Wentz, John Perry, Les Hough, 
and Pete Hutter to settle the 
contest with a final 63-32 score.
New Tartan lineups in both of 
the relay teams proved to be dis
astrous to Case Tech on Friday 
as they not only took first places 
but set new team records. For 
the first time Bill Cotsworth, Fred 
Rial, Pete Hutter, and Merrill 
Moter, who usually finish at the 
top in single events, all swam in 
the same lane to better the old 
Medley Relay Team record by 
3.9 seconds with a time of four 
minutes and 10.5 seconds. The 
400-yard medley relay is the

A club lead would have de
feated the contract immediately, 
but West made the more normal 
diamond lead and South still had 
a chance. He ruffed the diamond, 
led a spade to the ace and a 
spade back. When East showed 
out, South rose with the king and 
led the six of spades to Wests 
queen. This play of the six con
vinced East that his partner was 
out of trumps and aided South 
significantly later. West returned 
a diamond, covered by the eight 
and jack and ruffed with de
clarers next to last trump. After 
three clubs were cashed, the sit

Tech Marksmen 
Win Again
Last Saturday, the Tech sharp
shooters traveled to Geneva and 
defeated their rifle team by a 
score of 1396 to 1372. On the top 
end for Tech were Ted Mankovich 286 and freshman Eric Sandgren 283. Also worth mentioning 
v/as freshman Steve Roths 274. 
It was the first time this year 
two freshmen have shot into the 
top five.
The victory last Saturday com
bined with the wins at Pitt over 
Pitt, W & J, and Allegheny gives 
our Tartan team a 14 and 1 mark 
and continued our tie for the 
league lead with Clarion. Only 
one match remains on the league 
schedule, at Indiana University; 
that victory will assure Tech of a 
first place tie with Clarion.
March 17, 18, and 19 are big 
days for Tech as she travels to 
Annapolis, Maryland with three 
teams for the Intercollegiate 
Rifle Sectional. Major Steinbach 
has high hopes for his shooters.
Loyalty award of the week 
must go to Bruce McKelvy a 
sophomore member of both swim
ming and rifle teams. After swim
ming against Case, Friday, where 
he took a second in breaststroke, 
he was taken off -the bus at 
Beaver Falls and rushed to the 
match. His 275 was good enough 
for top five honors.
opening event of a swim meet 
and is composed of successive 
100-yard swims of the back, breast 
butterfly, and freestyle strokes. 
Since it is worth only seven 
points to the winner, the best 
swimmers normally conserve 
their energy for the individual 
events. Fred Rial negated this 
theory, however, by later swim
ming the 200-yard breast stroke 
in the record time of two min
utes and 34.3 seconds, knocking 
seven-tenths of a second off his 
old record. In the free style re
lay Bil Coteworth, Merrill Moter, 
and Pete Hutter united once 
again, and along with Les Hough 
set a new team record of three 
minutes and 33.1 seconds. Other 
first places were won by Jim 
Wentz (200-yard free style), John 
Bennett (diving), and John 
OBrien (500-yard feestyle).
Techs last home meet is to
day (March 1) against Kent 
State University at 4 pm.
Girls Get Easy 
Win Over Geneva
Techs Womens Basketball 
team played Geneva in its first 
home game of the season. Thanks 
to the high scoring of Linda Hood 
and the consistent rebounding of 
Peggy Herre, Tech was able to 
take the lead ;arly in the first 
quarter and Geneva never serious
ly challenged it. At half-time the 
scoreboard read 26-18, and when 
the final buzzer sounded Tech led 
41-35.
On Tuesday the Tartettes meet 
Pitt for a rematch on their home 
court. In Techs first encounter 
with Pitts Physical Education 
majors, the team lost three first 
string players, Mary Bookwalter, 
Mary Rhodes, and Linda Hood, 
due to personal fouls. Tech was 
still able to come within nine 
points of the Panthers, however, 
losing by a score of 37-28.
Linda Hood paces girls to win 
over Geneva.
