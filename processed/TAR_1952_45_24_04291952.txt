Prevue of Music Hits 
In S 'nS This Saturday
Probably the biggest ring appearing on the 20 year Scotch n 
Soda calendar is around May 6, 7, and 8, when Good Heavens is 
staged in the new SnS theater. Techs musical comedy club has 
long hoped to have a theater of its own, and at last it seems real
ized. ?
Anxious to try out its new home 
and at the same time make some 
very important technical tests, the 
Scotch n Soda club has scheduled 
a prevue this Saturday night at 8 
p.m. The purposes behind the re
vue are: (1) to show the student 
body the new theater and several 
of the hits from next weeks show; 
and (2) to test the new sound and 
lighting equipment under condi
tions of an actual production in 
order to remove all the bugs 
before the show hits the stage.
The entire technical crew un
der Ken Rossignols guidance has 
been working overtime since Eas
ter vacation to completely remove 
all the gym atmosphere from

Oratory Contest 
Won By Tech 
Drama Student
John Ragin-, of the Carnegie 
drama department, was recently 
crowned the oratorical champion 
of Allegheny County. He was 
awarded the first prize in the 
Henry C^iy oratorical competi
tion sponsored by the Pittsburgh 
Sun-Telegraph.
Unanimously awarded the first 
place, Ragin was declared by 
many veteran fans to be one of 
the finest speakers ever to par
ticipate in the decade of oratoricals. A $250 U.S. defense bond 
was his first prize award, and he 
was given an additional $50 bond 
for reaching the mid-west finals 
of the coast to coast competition 
to be held May 12.
Dr. John C. Warner, President 
of Carnegie Tech, served as a 
member of the local honorary 
sponsoring committee. Mrs. Edith 
Skinner was the chairman of the 
local supervisory committee, and 
one of the judges for the high 
school competition.
With Machine-like Precision
Army ROTC Is Excellent, 
But Alchemist Likes Alchemy
By John J. John, Jr., as told to Dick Dustine
Being a fine, bright-eyed, high-minded, clean-limbed American 
youth (as well as having been led to believe that I would not have 
to take physical education if I did so), I enrolled, upon entering the 
department of alchemy at Carnegie Tech, in the Army Reserve Offi* Training Corps (known,*cers
among other things, as Ed Yorkison and his Dancing Mice).
Each of us, upon joining this 
organization, was presented with 
a uniform of nondescript color, 
size, and shape, a book, and later 
with a pair of shoes (loose fitting 
or tight fitting, depending upon 
individual preference) and an 
emasculated M-l rifle.
Small Railroad
Every Thursday, when weather 
permits, and it usually does, some 
78,000 of us troop happily through 
the dung-colored mire of the Cut, 
under the guidance of a host of
brown-frocked juniors and sen
iors, many swathed in endless 
yards of blue braid, learning what 
is known as leadership, drill, and 
exercise of command. The layman 
would call it marching, but the 
Army has a high sounding name 
for everything except eating, 
which it calls mess.
But first let us consider the or
ganization of the CIT ROTC de
tachment. At the top is a person 
known only as The Colonel 
or PMS&T (probably the name 
of a small midwestern railroad).

TAWANTUESDAY, APRIL 29, 1952
Editorial
No One Man Armies
As we are kissing our sister publication the Scot good
bye, and sit back to decide what really made her go (or 
be sent away), many ideas come to mind and stick as points 
the Tartan and other publications should watch out for in 
their organization. There are the minor points of adminis
tration censorship, etc., but they arent what ran the Scot 
into the red. Magazines such as the Penn State Froth keep 
in the black, and its jokes are cleaner than some of the 
Scots.
The Scot has had considerable trouble during the last 
year in getting students to write for it, and before that time 
it made no effort to encourage lowerclassmen to work on 
its staff. About two years ago, right after the magazine 
came out of its last scuff with the schools governing body, 
the magazine was handled by a few people who had unusual 
talents. These jack-of-all-trades editors were content to do 
everything themselves, for they found that in that way they 
had fewer fights and (in their opinion) printed a variety 
magazine that had no evidence of inferior workmanship.
Every publication at Tech has run into this trouble at 
sometime; some even feel the Technical is already experiencing: 
such difficulties, and for the same reason. Editors have a nack 
for feeling important in the presence of their staff and always are 
worrying about make-up and special projects of the individual 
issue, and they pass off their personnel problems to a personnel 
manager who is never aroundprobably because he doesnt rereive any encouragement from the editor.
When a student receives the appointment of editor-inchief, it doesnt mean that he has taken upon himself the 
entire work of putting out each issue. The editor who does 
this soon gets lost in the constant muddle that faces him 
and doesn't notice that what he had of a staff when he took 
over is walking out the door because its presence wasnt even 
noticed. After a while the editor wakes up and decides he 
needs help, so he places a box in the Tartan telling all in
terested parties to show up at the next staff meeting. Of 
course, between the fact that the such an appeal is weakly 
voiced and that his reputation for having a cold shoulder 
toward his helpers has spread over the campus and through 
the dorms, no one shows up at the meeting.
This procedure will be followed a few more times, then our 
friend editor gives up; he has made his appeal for personnel, 
but there just isnt anyone on campus interested in doing such 
work; after all, this is an engineering school. Each editor must 
realize that the above mentioned method plus his apparent at
titude will never yield him any helpers.
The correct way to hold on to a staff doesnt seem any 
more difficult to us, though. Each editor must set up a sub
staff under him to handle each of the phases of publication, 
and his job reverts to that of an overseer and he is free to 
do the special tasks required of an editor. One of these tasks 
is to know all the persons who come up to his office to help 
on each issue. This whole plan, though, doesnt do away with 
the personnel manager, whose job it is to keep a record of 
the staff members names and habitats (even if it is the 
Greeks) on paper rather then in his head. He also shows up 
at staff meetings other than the annual banquet, and meets 
every new person who enters the office, and nails him down 
to a job right then and there.
A publication which follows this modus operendi will 
soon* find that all the necessary variety can be found on its 
staff, and all other functions will move along smoothly. And 
last but not least, with enough staff members to handle 
everything, there wont be any need to work in the Union 
after midnight.

STOP AND BREATHE
Editorial
Councils Current Contradiction
An issue that was top campus news just three years ago 
reared its head once again in Student Council meeting last 
Wednesday, but, after brief discussion, passed back again into 
limbo. y
The Hare System*, alternate method of ballot counting 
for Council elections, and one of the main points of a bitter 
fraternity-independent squabble in the spring of 1949, re
ceived the vote of a scant third of the present Councilmembers.
But this time the issue was not fraternity versus non-fra
ternity, Council now being composed almost wholly of fraternity 
members and sympathizers, all fervently denying that any sort 
of political organization exists anywhere at Carnegie, and piously 
stating that if the independents want more votes they have only 
to get out and vote.
These Hare System sympathies seemed in direct opposi
tion to the sentiments expressed only a few minutes before 
in a discussion of the possibility for building up something 
called School Spirit.
On one hand, the elected representatives grope for a 
method of stimulating spirit; on the other they grunt, If 
the independents are interested they can get out and vote. 
The interest lies in the fraternities, it is only right that they 
should control affairs. But how well have they done at this? 
Is this fraternity leadership as strong as some would like to 
suggest?
Three years back, when the independent bloc was strong 
enough to rate a voting majority, but not enough for the necessary 
two-thirds to change the by-laws of Council, the Hare System 
was the pet project of the independent forces. Today, with In
dependent representation at an extreme low, spirit waning, and 
political organizations virtually nonexistent, the system still fails 
to receive Council approval, though it would hardly seem that 
the present issue is one cf political factions.
In brief the advantages of the Hare system, are as fol
lows:
1. The System tends to make possible a condition of 
proportional representation, giving minority voting groups an 
increased opportunity for representation.
2. The individuals vote will mean more, will be trans
ferred to a second choice candidate if not used by the voters 
first place choice. The voter thus carries added weight. Poli
tical parties or not, the Hare System favors the individual 
voter.
3. Ballot counting time will be cut by at least one-half.
Principal argument in the opposite direction is that each
voter will have a hand in electing only one candidate. This 
point, however, was not advanced by any of the present 
Councils opponents to the Hare System, who argued mainly 
that since the fraternity bloc can poll more than half the 
votes, it deserves 100 percent of the council representation.
So an old issue has risen up and died again, and things go 
on as usual, with Councilmen looking for answers to campus 
problems, particularly if they are to be had without changing 
the status quo in any manner.
Letters
Editor, the Tartan:
Sence l kum heer to Karnegie 
Teche last alutomn from Indianer, I am much intrested in how 
good them littel farmhands is vt 
dropping bonedust on the grasse 
each springtime. Although back in 
Buck Crick we dont use bonedust 
so much, it is reely good fur the 
grasse and makes the place look 
wej. My paw would be proude fur 
he always wanted mee to go to 
one of them green grasse Ivie 
ligue collidges in the east.
Thare is onli one thing wrong 
with putting all thet bonedust on 
the grasse. It is no good if it jest 
runs oc into the rivur evry time 
it ranes and who wants to eat 
bonedust in there drinking water. 
Evry time it ranes here all that 
bonedust gos rollin down Forbes 
Street rlht by the kar stope on 
top of wich it gos splashing on 
evryone when a kar gos by. I do 
not want to see all that bonedust 
going to waist nor do I want furtilyzer splashed al ovr mee. I 
thought I was al throo with that 
when I left Buck Crick.
I would appreesheate it vojcy 
much if Stoont Cownsill wood

Draft Notice
The following procedure 
will be followed by Carnegie 
Tech to help those students 
who wish to request defer
ment for further study.
1. Before final examinations 
begin (May 26), and prefera
bly as soon as possible, you 
should report to the office of 
Dean Jones, AH 254-C, to fill 
out the first six lines on SS 
Form 109. Dean Jones has 
these forms.
2. As soon as class standings 
for the current academic year 
are determined, the 109 forms 
will be completed by Carnegie 
Tech and mailed to your draft 
board, together with a letter 
from Tech requesting your de
ferment.
Hare System 
Explained
Just what is meant by the 
Hare System and how it 
would function at all-school 
elections is expressed as fol
lows:
The voter will still place a  
number of preferences on the 
ballot, as is the case today, 
but there the similarity ends. 
Under the present preferential 
system, votes are worth a 
given number of points, the 
persons with the top point to
tals winning the election.
Under the proposed but de
feated method, only first place 
votes would be counted at 
first. If, according to calcula
tions of the minimum number 
of votes needed for election, 
a candidate wins on the first 
count, he is declared elected, 
and his excess ballots (those 
he received over and above 
the minimum number for elec
tion) go -to the second place 
choices on the ballots. The 
portion of ballots that is to 
be used for this transfer is 
chosen by a method which 
will allow the laws of chance 
to operate in chosing who 
would get the second place 
votes.
The person with the lowest 
number of votes is declared 
defeated, and his ballots given 
to the second choices marked 
on them.
Once again the counters 
check to see if anyone has the 
necessary votes for election. 
If so, he is elected; if not an
other person cut off the bot
tom, until the required num
ber of candidates is declared 
elected.

Next Opponents Pessimistic 
The Tartans, who ran away 
with most of the honors at Case 
Institute last week, are threatening 
to do the same thing when they 
meet the Covies at Reeves field. 
This prediction, quoted from the 
Geneva College News Bulletin in 
anticipation of their meet with the
anchor man on the winning relay j tartans today, has been made 
team of Ball, Englehart, Valias, ! even more promising as Coach 
and Luchok. i Guy Halfertys trackmen showed
Grove City speedsters took j such terrific power in sweeping 
first place in only two of the track Srand slams in the mile, two mile,

but they outperformed the home 
team in the field events by earn

Tartan Netters Start Season, 
Top Dukes In Close 5-4 Match
Carnegie Racqueteers Were Forced To 
Make Final Doubles Mateh Count In Win
The Tartan tennis team Started its season by receiving a 
scare which is bound to keep it alert and on its guard for the rest 
of the season.
The Skibo netters started out by taking their first set in each 
of the first two matches, then they** 
apparently relaxed which was 
just what the Duquesne netters 
needed as they returned to take 
the following two sets from their 
Carnegie opponents.
Coach Frank Moses was forced 
to rely on his teams depth to pull 
the match out of the fire as the 
first three netmen for Carnegie 
went down to defeat at the hands 
of the skillful Duquesne leaders.
The single matches ended in a 
3-3 tie as Bob Duffus, Mahlon Saibel, and Don Duncklee captured 
the last three singles matches.
The doubles play started with 
an air of disappointment as Jim
COMING EVENTS
Following is a list of var
sity athletic events which will 
be held this week in Pitts
burgh and abroad.
Eddie Baker Pessimistic Now 
Key Positions Still Unfilledw
Because of the departure of such stalwarts as Johnny Luchok, 
Arne Oberg, Fritz Wilson, Quet Holtz, Herman Whitenight, Ted 
Leaman, Dale Startzell, Hans Lange, and George Rusnak, Coach 
Eddie Baker is inclined to look toward the gloomy side in viewing
? his prospects for 1952. He has am
ple reason for adopting this out
look, however, for in the group 
mentioned above rested the nuc
leus of the offensive strength 
that has carried the Plaid through 
its last two successful seasons.
The biggest problem, however, 
lies in developing a reliable of
fensive quarterback, for there are 
no seasoned veterans ready to 
take over where Quent Holtz left 
off. Freshmen Guy Carricato and 
Ed Miller are being groomed for 
this position.
The one backfield post in which 
the Plaid seems to be well sup
plied is the fullback position. Al
though last years starter, Gil Dissen, has missed spring practice 
because of a shoulder ailment it 
is reported that he will be able to 
play when fall rolls around; if 
not, Tom Warner, Jim Blatt, or 
Don Skillin will be standing by 
ready to go.
Unless the offense develops, the 
fans are not likely to see the opentype, high scoring games display
ed by the Tartans in the recent 
years.
Miller and A1 Glasser were de
feated by Duquesnes number one 
doubles team. But the never die 
spirit seemed to strengthen the 
Tartan squad as they retaliated. to 
take the second and third doubles 
matches and capture the tennis 
meet by a score of 5-4.

TAOTtANTUESDAY, APRIL 29, 1952>
Hare System Defeated; 
SC Discontinues Scot
by Dick Christensen
The center of controversy at last Wednesday's Council meeting 
was Dick Durstines proposed revision of the method of counting bal
lots in SC elections. Under the present system voters indicate their 
choices by giving first, second, third, etc. place to the respective can
didates. Each candidate then re-4 
ceives a certain point total com
puted according to the number
of votes he received for each 
place. (See editorial, page 2).
Durstine charged that this sys
tem is unfair to small minorities 
and independent voters, saying it 
enabled a bloc with only a slight 
majority to determine the entire 
slate elected.
Those Interested Vote
Fred Sonnenberg spoke up for 
the proposed change, emphasizing 
the possible increase in interest in 
elections on the part of indepen
dents. Dick Franklin, however, 
opposed the motion on the ground 
that under the present set-up the 
students interested in campus 
government sway the elections.
George Farneth stated that al
though the independents are in 
numerical superiority, they have 
not shown any interest in sup
porting candidates. Thus, he rea
soned, the change would have no 
practical effect.
The dilemma was obvious; 
Councilmen had to reconcile 
their function to establish and 
perpetuate school spirit with the 
fact that the lack of school spirit 
was being used to justify the pres
ent ballot-counting method. After 
some further discussion the mo
tion to adopt the Hare system was 
defeated (12-7).
May Appeal Decision
The motion to discontinue the 
Scot was passed with no dis
senting votes. The staff now has 
recourse to the editorial board of 
appeals for reconsideration of 
their status. The Spring Carnival 
issue will come out regardless of 
the final decision.
Marilyn Seiner, elections chair
man, reported that the number of 
architects who desired absentee 
voting privileges for the class

only secondary school students, but 
also their teachers and parents. 
The administration expects several 
hundred visitors to make a suc
cess of the first Open House in 
15 years.
Many Special. Exhibits
Many of the departments in 
E&S, MMCC, and H&SS will have 
special exhibits and demonstra
tions. Several departments of E&S 
have announced their contribu
tions. The department of Metal
lurgical Engineering is having, 
among other exhibits, a demon
stration of the preparation of ore 
for iron-making. Highlighting the 
Civil Engineering display will be 
a model of the transportation of 
solid materials, such as coal, by 
water in pipe lines and open chan

department will have a radar set

picture of the Oakland area of 
Pittsburgh as it would appear to 
a low-flying bomber.
organizations elections in May was 
too small to warrant the trouble 
and expense involved.
Scholarship
A scholarship in the amount 
of $150.00 will be awarded by 
Mortar Board to a junior 
woman meeting the specified 
qualifications of leadership 
and service.
Junior women having at 
least a 2.5 average factor for 
the two previous semesters, 
and desiring to apply for this 
scholarship, should secure an 
application in Dean Schaefers 
Office between April 23 and 
May 24.

ROTC Review 
Made By Army 
Board Officers
Special classes and a formal 
drill ceremony marked the annual 
ROTC formal inspection today, 
April 29. The review was made 
by a board of officers appointed 
by Second Army Headquarters.
The inspection of the unit is 
complete, including students, mili
tary personnel, training methods, 
and equipment. In order to afford 
the inspectors a better opportunity 
to examine all these facets, the 
military department has scheduled 
special classes today for all ROTC 
students. Also, the entire unit 
performed in a formal drill cere
mony of the Cut at 11:30.
As a result of this inspection, 
the MS&T Department will re
ceive a rating which is an indica
tion of the efficiency of the unit 
and the extent to which it fulfills 
its mission here. According to Ma
jor Nicholas A. Lord, Assistant 
PMS&T, this mission is first to 
produce trained army reserve of
ficers and second to produce bet
ter all-around citizens. Carnegies 
present rating is one of the high
est in the country.

New Drama 
Production 
Opens May 7
You Never Can Tell, a comedy 
in four acts by George Bernard 
Shaw, will be the final major pro
duction of the drama department 
this year. The story deals with a 
man who has driven away his 
wife and children. The family is 
accidently re-united with explo
sive results. The main question 
which Shaw raises in this play is 
whether it is better to be an en
lightened woman or an old fash
ioned one,
You Never Can Tell will open 
on May 7 and 8. It will*not be en
acted on May 9 and 10 (during 
Spring Carnival). The play will 
resume on May 12, and continue 
through Saturday, May 17. There 
will be a matinee on May 16.
Tickets will be available to all 
students at 4 p.m. on Thursday, 
May 1, in the drama department 
office. The play is being directed 
by Mr. Charles Newman.

[Continued from page 1]
He is seldom seen by lowerclassmen except during official func
tions.
Rifle & Rifle Number
The Colonels orders are trans
mitted to us mainly by one Major 
Godd (who spells his name with 
two ds to avoid confusion), who 
is delegated to speak over a porta
ble public address system sup
plied for the purpose.
The major is carried to and 
from the drill field in a curtained 
litter, borne by members of the 
military honorary, Rifle and Rifle 
Number, and inscribed with the 
legend: Uncle Sam Wants YOU. 
Also present at the drill, as mis
sionaries for the army-type life, 
are assorted other officers, com
missioned, warrant, and otherwise, 
who circulate through the campus 
at will, and are changed every 
three years, like water in a swim
ming pool.
Important among these is Mr. 
Paycheck, who commands the 
band, an organization that marches 
and plays its one tune in a most 
unusual manner. It is with Mr. 
Paycheck and his band that we 
begin each review.
Messengers, Apparitions, etc. 
The troops line up in orderly 
rows (it is easy to get in a straight 
line while standing still). This is 
followed by a complex and ob
scure litany, which is conducted 
by Major Godd, Mr. Astle, student 
commander, Mr. Yorkison (who 
needs no public address system), 
subaltern to Mr. Astle, and assort
ed officers, soldiers, murderers, at
tendants, messengers, apparitions, 
etc. Finally, the major inquires, 
are you ready, Mr. Paycheck? 
Mr. Paycheck is usually ready.
Then comes the command: You 
may begin, Mr. Paycheck. Mr. 
Paycheck begins. On one occasion, 
the major decided, too late, that 
Mr. Paycheck shouldnt have be
gun quite yet, and requested* 
Stop, Mr. Paycheck. Mr. Pay
check didnt stop. STOP, MR. 
PAYCHECK . . .
STOP, MR. PAYCHECK!
But there was no stopping Mr. 
Paycheck, who moved relentlessly 
down the field, looking neither to 
the right nor to the left. So Ma
jor Godd ordered, Pull out, Mr. 
Davidson. Mr. Davidson pulled 
out. We followed, with uncommon 
precision, in the steps of Mr. Dav
idson and the band.
We marched through a treach
erous swamp, and past the review
ing stand (polite name fpr the plot
of earth on which The Colonel 
stands), in a neat parabolic arc, 
our eyes turned right in salute. 
The drill was then complete.
We returned our rifles to the 
supply room, and headed enmasse 
for Skibo and a filling bowl of thin 
gruel.
Other Classes
But the ROTC holds classes 
other than leadership, drill, and 
exercise of command. There are 
courses in wire laying, radio op
eration, bridge demolition, blind 
obedience, red tape operation, how 
to follow a rut, and military prob
lems of Guadeloupe.
We learn many interesting and 
useful things in these clases. Ev
erything in the Army has a num
ber. We are taught that in order 
to light cigarette C-877k we must 
strike match M-976gx on shoe 
sole SS-543, and then hold said 
match M-976gx near cigarette 
C-877k until it is ignited by flame 
F-657. All the time one must cre
ate a draft using mouth M-756 
and lungs L-564. All this equip
ment will be replaced soon by 
more efficient models, however.
Fortunate Thing
This method certainly helps to 
clarify things, particularly for 
Army career men who would oth
erwise be lost in the intricacies of 
civilian liie.
Truly Uncle Sam thinks of ev
erything. He even thinks I would 
make a good foot soldier. My draft 
board told me so. But I would 
rather be an alchemist. There is 
more money in it, and we can use 
numbers there, too.
