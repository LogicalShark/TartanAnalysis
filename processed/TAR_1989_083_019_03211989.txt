Spirit representatives, black alumni, and NAACP representatives speak with members of the press in the 
Blue Conference Room on the sixth floor of Warner Hall Thursday. They charged Campus Police with 
harassment and discrimination.
By MICHAEL EWEDOSH
Tartan Staffwriter
Last Thursday, members of 
Spirit met with administrators 
and Campus Police officials to 
discuss alleged harassment of 
blacks, specifically males, on 
campus.
Present at the meeting between 
administration and students were 
Provost Angel Jordan; Vice Presi
dent for Enrollment William Elli
ott; Campus Police Chief James 
LaPaglia; Student Ombudsman 
Michael Murphy; Judge Justin 
Johnson, a member of the Execu
tive Committee of the Board of 
Trustees; and Bob Pitts and 
Harvey Adams, both of the 
NAACP.
In a press conference following 
the meeting, Spirit President 
Nicole Austin, Spirit Executive 
Vice President Michael Bowman, 
and black alumnus David Turner 
related what they saw as the 
problems of minorities on cam
pus.
In a prepared statement, Austin 
said that last semester Spirit 
addressed the problems of minori
ties on campus, setting goals to
educate the campus on minority 
issues and to prevent further 
racial slurs and insults. She at
tributed these slurs to the cul
tural ignorance of both the ad
ministration and students.
Austin said the University 
failed to respond adequately to 
suggestions on improving Univer. sity programs and services. Now, 
several black students and alumni 
have been continually stopped by 
[Campusl Police, reported, and 
even taken in after presenting 
adequate ID. Austin accused 
Campus Police of immediately 
reacting to frantic, unjust re
quests by students and faculty. 
The result of their reaction, she 
continued, is the rude, repeated, 
harassment of black male stu-: 
dents. If police harassment is not 
controlled, it could result in a 
fatality.
Austin later explained that she 
meant that a case of mistaken 
identity could prove to be fatal to 
a student if that student were 
asked to stop and didnt realize 
that the officer was addressing 
him or her. Such a situation may 
occur, said Austin, where the officontinued on page 6

Morewood 
food trays
By RANDY L. UDAVCAK
Tartan Staffwriter
Barbara Glover, an ABM employee 
in Morewood Gardens, is tired of 
returning used dining service trays 
to the downstairs facilities. I used 
to do it, she says, but it got out of 
hand. It got to the point where I was 
using a shopping cart to take them 
all down.
Over 2000 trays are missing from 
the Morewood Cafeteria and MorePizza facilities this semester alone, 
according to CMDS Morewood Gar
dens Manager Madison Cherry.
The main source of the problem, 
says Cherry, lies specifically with 
MorePizza. It seems that the mind
set in the pizza shop is take-out, 
said Cherry, but people take the
tray with their pizza out the front 
door. Those who live here in More
wood Gardens take their trays up
stairs and never bring them back. 
Morewood is currently in the midst 
of a shortage because of the thefts.
Cherry has asked ABM employ
ees to pick up trays left in the halls, 
and some have agreed to do so, even 
though they are not required to. 
According to Cherry, ABM employ
ees return an average of: 60 to 80 
trays per day.
The patience of ABM employees 
is beginning to wane, however, as 
the number of trays in the residence 
hall continues to increase. Glover 
got so tired of the extra work that 
she spoke with her supervisor, who 
agreed she should stop spending 
her time collecting used trays.
ABM employee Theresa Magilson 
feels that it isnt a part of ABMs job 
to pick up students trays. We dont 
feel were supposed to pick them up. 
We feel the students are supposed 
to take the responsibility for them. 
Many students, Glover says, have

Blacks charge security with harassment
In the past two weeks, student groups have 
begun protesting the delay of the proposed 
University Center. Administration reaction 
has been subdued.
The most dramatic action was taken by Stu

Some people did not want to sign, said 
Franco. Some were graduate students who 
did not know about [the issues involving] the 
University Center. Some said that the Center 
was not needed. Others did not agree with the 
petition, and others said they were late for

Despite allegations to the con
trary, H&SS Dean Stephen Fien
berg did not say that he was trying 
to phase BA degrees out of the 
college at a February 20 College 
Council meeting, according to an 
official transcript released last 
week.
The release of the transcript
was an attempt by the H&SS 
administration to clear up ques
tions surrounding comments that 
Fienberg allegedly made during 
the meeting. Different people who 
attended the meeting had quoted 
Fienberg differently.
The controversy started When 
the Student Union reported in an 
editorial on February 22 that 
Fienberg said he thought he 
made it clear that BA programs
were to be phased out of the col
lege.
The Union editorial was writ
ten by H&SS students Matt 
Ruben and Kevin DeYager. Ruben 
is an H&SS student senator and 
one of two undergraduate repre
sentatives  along with Senator 
Frank DiVito  on the College 
Council.
Elenbergs comments suppos
edly came during discussion of
proposed BS and BA programs in 
social science history. The Coun
cil eventually approved the bache
lor of science degree but tabled 
the bachelor of arts degree for 
that major.
Although exact departmental 
requirements vary, the main dif
ference between a BS and a BA 
degree in H&SS is an increased 
concentration in mathematics and 
statistics for the former.
According to H&SS policy, Col
lege Council meetings are closed 
to the press. Proceedings of the 
meetings are communicated only 
through official minutes approved 
by the Council as a whole, and 
comments are not, as a rule, at-, 
tributed to individuals, H&SS 
College Council Chair Joseph 
Devine said.

This is the second time this 
semester the Ball has been 
cancelled. Originally scheduled 
for March 11 in the CFA build
ing, the Ball was changed to 
March 20 at the Strip Districts 
Metropol after faculty members 
and administrators cancelled it 
because of property damage, 
underage drinking, and drug 
use at the Ball held in 1985.
The Ball, which has been held 
in the CFA buildingfor74years, 
is a once-every-four-years cos
tume party that customarily 
attracts over 1200 CFA stu
dents, faculty, staff, and alumni
to the night-long revelry. It was 
one of the campus oldest tradi
tions.
This year, however, the Ball 
was planned for a Monday night; 
tickets cost $30 apiece; it was to 
be off-campus; and Metropol was 
going to run a cash bar. Those 
are the four main reasons that 
there was no student interest, 
said Walter.
The students who organized 
the Ball cited price and location 
as the biggest hurdles. People 
just werent as psyched up for it

European mine 
explosion causes 
earthquake
FRANKFURT (DJ)An earth
quake measuring 5.7 on the Rich
ter scale shook central parts of 
West Germany last Monday caus
ing injuries and damage in vil
lages on the East German border, 
the state-run news agency ADN 
said.
West German authorities said 
the earthquake registered 5.7 on 
the open-ended Richter scale, 
while ADN gave the quakes 
magnitude as 5.5.
ADN said chimneys fell in the 
village of Vacha, on the border of 
East Germany, where several 
people were also injured. The 
agency did not say how many 
people were injured.
It said buildings in four other 
villages in the area also suffered 
damage. The quake caused power 
outages and streets in the four 
villages were blocked by rubble, 
ADN said.
The agency said the quake was 
triggered by a massive cave-in 
that was caused by blasting in a 
potash mine in Merkers, ten kilo
meters from the border with East 
Germany.
Air Force jets

MADRID, Spain (AP)Two F16 jet fighters from the U.S. Air 
Force collided in flight last Tues
day, leaving one pilot missing and 
feared dead, U.S. military offi

The second pilot was reported 
hospitalized in satisfactory con
dition.
The collision occurred about 
2:45 pm during a training mis
sion over central Spains Cuenca 
province, said Air Force Capt. 
Willette Parker.
She said the jets had left 
Madrids Torrejon Air Base.
A statement released by the 
Spanish Ministry of Defense said 
one of the pilots parachuted to 
safety and was hospitalized. The 
Ministry of Defense said the sec
ond pilot died, but the Air Force 
would only say the pilot was 
missing.
German hackers 
access low-level US 
military computers
WASHINGTON (AP)  A spy 
ring of West German computer 
hackers gained access to lower 
level military data banks over the 
last two years but appears not to 
have penetrated any system con
taining classified secrets, the 
Pentagon said.
Based on the information that 
we have thus far, and this is not 
complete,... our best judgment is 
that the computer hackers did 
not penetrate secure programs, 
said Pentagon spokesman Dan 
Howard.
He said a two-week review of 
the evidence assembled by Ameri
can and West German authori
ties suggests the spy ring never 
gained access to any computer 
system containing classified se
crets.
All this is subject to change
should new information turn up 
in the course of the investigation. 
But to the best of our knowledge, 
it does not appear at this point 
that there was any compromise of 
classified information, Howard 
said.

Carnegie Mellon President 
Richard Cyert and University of 
Pittsburgh President Wesley 
posvar helped announce the ac
quisition of the new Cray Y-MP 
supercomputer by the Pittsburgh 
&apercomputing Center (PSC) 
]a!st week.
o As the first non-government in
stallation of a Y-MP to date, the 
new system represents a major 
'step in the extension of super'jmputing power to educational 
and corporate users.
^The announcement came as 
p&rt of a demonstration and press 
psiference at the Westinghouse 
Energy Center Tuesday. Cyert 
and Posvar joined PSC Executive 
Director Beverly Clayton in an
nouncing the installation of the 
new supercomputer, and both 
presidents offered insights into 
the types of projects for which 
their university researchers will 
use the centers facilities.
Westinghouse has purchased 
the Cray X-MP which the center 
used for the past two and a half 
years.
According to Cyert, supercom
puting will become increasingly 
important in the development of 
new scientific theories and dis
coveries here in the United States. 
During his segment of the pres
entation he said, The important 
point for this center is that we are 
here, really, to advance science. 
The advancement in science is 
crucial to the long-run health of 
the nation. It is my view that the 
nation which is going to be able to 
do research on a significant scale 
and build up a pool of knowledge 
out of which we can transfer tech
nology to commercial operations 
is going to be the country that, for 
the long-run, is the international 
leader in trade.
The PSC began in January,
1986 with funding approval from 
the National Science Foundation 
(NSF), making it the fifth such 
supercomputing center in the 
country. Founded as a joint proj
ect of CMU, Pitt, and Westing
house, the PSC provides an op
portunity for scientists and engi
neers from diverse research insti
tutions  universities, corpora
tions^ and federally-funded na
tional agencies  to interact and 
share the speed of the Cray.
Although the actual computer 
system is housed and maintained 
at the Westinghouse Energy 
Center near Monroeville, the PSC 
is located in Mellon Institute and 
has access to the Cray via a direct 
ethemet bridge and eight tele
phone dial-up lines. The system

CMU President Richard Cyert is one of four executives helping to cut 
the ribbon on the PSCs new Cray Y-MP. The new computer is the first 
of its kind outside of those owned by government agencies.
is also connected to a variety of power over the XMP and will 
major national communications eventually replace the o\der sysnetworks, including BITnet, 
DECnet, and Arpanet.
Funding for the center is pro
vided by the NSF and the Com
monwealth of Pennsylvania, as 
well as research agreements with 
Cray Research and Digital Equip
ment Corporation. The center has 
also received a grant from the Na
tional Institute of Health to pro
vide the biomedical community 
with supercomputing resources, 
training, and user support.
When the PSC was established 
in 1986, its workhorse was the 
Cray X-MP supercomputer. The 
new Y-MP, unofficially termed the 
Y, represents about a threefold 
increase in overall processing
tem. The Yboasts eight independ
ent processors, each nmning with 
a processor clock cycle of 6 nanos
econds.
For comparison, a Macintosh II 
processor has a clock cycle of ap
proximately 62 nanoseconds, 
making each of the Ys eight proc
essors more than ten times as fast 
as the Mac. The main processing 
unit also works with an over
whelming 256 megabytes of ran
dom access memory.
In addition to the main process
ing unit, the YMP also incorpo
rates a solid state storage device 
which adds an additional 1024 
megabytes of external memory. 
Disk storage is provided by 32
units with a capacity of 1.2 giga
bytes (approximately 1 billion 
bytes) each, as well as a newer 
single unit which holds about 20 
gigabytes of information. To bring 
these numbers into the realm of 
understanding, the Ys total 
amount of disk storage is roughly 
five times the total disk storage 
capacity of all the personal com
puters on the Carnegie Mellon 
campus.
Programs which are to be proc
essed and run on the Cray are 
organized and channeled using a 
VAX-based front-end system 
supplied by Digital Equipment 
Corporation. The system, running 
multiple VAX 8810 units under 
the VMS operating system, holds 
the responsibility of streaming 
jobs to the Y, as well as monitor
ing its processing and perform
ance.
In addition to changing hard
ware configurations, the PSC is 
also in the process of moving all of 
its super computing projects from 
their original operating system, 
COS (Cray Operating System) to 
the newer, UNIX-based UNICOS 
operating system.
Currently, half of the day is 
devoted to running under the COS 
operating system, and the other 
half is run under the newer 
UNICOS. According to User 
Consultant Chuck Maiden, 
UNICOS is really the operating 
system that Cray has planned as 
the operating system. Basically,
they are ready to dump every*- 
thing and put all their efforts into 
UNICOS.
Because of the huge number of 
users the PSC serves, facilities 
for off-line file archiving have 
recently been put in place. The 
CFS, or Common File System; 
was developed in Los Alamos, 
California,>and is now used as an 
archiving system which allows 
users of the X-MP and Y-MP to 
permanently store their files on 
tape for possible retrieval later;. 
According to Maiden, the main 
Cray disk space is rarely used fo^ 
general file storage.
In the future, Carnegie Mellorl 
plans to have an even greater 
involvement in supercomputing 
technology and the PSC. Already v 
CMU has promised to buy the 
Cray III, a supercomputer which 
is still being designed by Cray 
Research. At the announcement 
on Tuesday, Cyert indicated tha^ 
eventually the Cray III will ref 
place the Y-MP, thereby dramati
cally increasing the supercomr 
puting power available to scienr 
tists and engineers.
We are also committed to a 
Cray III which is still on the drawl
ing board, he said. We hav$ 
confidence in Cray.... We ar$ 
certain that we will get a III. Thi 
is a strategy that we are following 
to make certain that this center is 
always at the cutting edge, and 
that we really are the leaders 
among the five centers.

Amnesty is politi
cal. By granting 
them funding, Sen
ate broke its own 
rules. 
 Carlos Franco
The president of CMUs chap
ter of Amnesty International, Jill 
Moore, went before the Funding 
and Recognition Committee to 
defend Amnestys qualifications 
for recognition. The vote passed 
four to zero with one abstention. 
Amnesty convinced us that their 
primary purpose was educa
tional, said Frank DiVito, chair 
of Funding and Recognition.
Moore was recently elected by 
Senate to fill a vacant seat and 
stresses that the primary pur
pose of the organization is human 
rights education.
Currently, seven student sena
tors are members of Amnesty 
International. .
Carlos Franco, one of the sena
tors who voted against recogni
tion, disagreed on the basis that it 
breaks rules explicitly set by 
Senate itself. Franco explained, 
I believe Amnesty is political, 
and that by granting them fund
ing, Senate broke its own rules. 
Student Senate has the power to 
change its rules. To me as a sena
tor, this gives unclear messages.
According to DiVito, Amnesty 
received a subsidy of $770 and 
has a full budget of $1120. Am
nestys budget hearing was sched
uled before the hearings of other 
campus organizations because of 
the certain debate over its politi
cal status.
According to Moore, arguments 
were brought up during the hear
ing concerning the fact that 
Amnesty would educate with a 
bias  for example, Amnesty 
would not sponsor a speaker on 
torture.
Moore replies that other or
ganizations such as ASA and 
Spirit educate with their side in 
mind. As a club, we let people
make up their own minds. 
Amnesty International has 
been established at CMU for more 
than a year and previously most 
of its money came from member
ship fees. Moore believes that the
funding from Student Senate will 
allow the organization to expand, 
and she hopes that they can spon
sor more campus-wide events, 
speakers and videos. As she ex
plains, if people are aware of
human rights abuses, they wont 
sit by and let them happen. |

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  21 March 1989

By JENNIFER B ANN AN
Tartan Staffwriter
For the past few months, resi
dents of Squirrel Hill have been 
cracking down on landlords who 
illegally overcrowd neighboring 
houses. The tenants most fre
quently involved in overcrowding 
of houses are students.
Most students are not aware 
that many houses in Squirrel Hill 
are in the One-Family Residence 
District (Rl), where it is illegal 
for more than three unrelated 
people to live together. According 
to Pennsylvania law, a group of 
not more than three persons who 
need not be related may live in 
housing in the one-family district. 
This means that if there are four 
residents, all must be related; if 
there are three, none need be 
related.
Other areas of Squirrel Hill fall 
into the Two-Family or ThreeFamily Residence Districts (R2 
and R3), where houses are split 
into two or three living units. The 
same law applies to each unit. R4 
districts are composed of apart
ment buildings.
Accordingto Arlene Stromberg, 
chair of the Squirrel Hill Urban
NEWS ANALYSIS
Coalition, residents have several 
reasons to be upset. She says that 
a heavy concentration of students 
usually accompanies absentee 
landlords, poor maintenance of 
property, noise, and an overabun
dance of cars. This results in a 
decrease in resale value on neigh
boring homes.
Neighbors are becoming watch
ful of such symptoms. Recently a 
Squirrel Hill resident reported a 
suspect house, and the zoning 
board planned an inspection. 
After being warned of the inspec
tion, the tenants were seen re
moving three mattresses from the 
house. Inspectors came, counted 
the beds, and declared living ar
rangements to be legal.
The same day neighbors wit
nessed three mattresses being 
brought back into the house. They 
checked the post office, finding 
six residents listed at that ad
dress. The city is now taking the 
landlord, Mike Gilson, to court.
Vivian Krall and her husband, 
Melvin Krall, of 5236 Forbes
Avenue, are the neighbors in
volved in the case. They have 
recently become involved in the 
Coalition and the Squirrel Hill 
Task Force because they feel their 
neighborhood is being hurt by 
overcrowding. What we and other 
property owners are concerned 
about, obviously, is the value of 
our property, says Melvin Krall, 
a certified public accountant.
Laura Goldberg, one of the 
students next door to the Kralls, 
says, We didnt know that [Viv
ian] was upset because our house 
looked run-down. We thought she 
just didnt want students living 
next to her.... She should have 
talked to us about it back in January when she was getting upset.
According to CMU Registrars 
data, Goldberg shares the house 
at 5420 Forbes with four other 
seniors'. Anita Fisher, Amy Keyhoe, Renee Smith, and Kristine 
Stringer.
The Kralls prefer to fight the 
situation as a whole, rather than 
deal specifically with the neigh
boring students. They feel that 
CMU is somewhat to blame for 
the deterioration of their neigh
borhood, because it does not sup
ply enough inexpensive campus
If we publicize the reality and they 
can no longer claim naivete, then I 
hope they all get evicted. 
 Sq. Hill resident Vivian Krall
housing for students.
Vivian Krall thinks that the 
neighborhood is on the road to 
becoming a slum, and sees this as 
an impediment to the University: 
I dont think that that pristine 
campus with the beautiful build
ings and green lawns would bene
fit from being in the middle of a 
slum area.
The Kralls make it clear that 
they do not blame students, who 
may not be aware of the law. 
When students enter into that 
kind of agreement innocently, 
then I feel sorry for what might 
happen.... But if we publicize the 
reality and they can no longer 
claim naivete, then I hope they all 
get evicted, Vivian said.
Not only do the Kralls blame 
landlords for not making students 
aware of the law, but also for the 
unethical breaking down of a 
good residential neighborhood. 
We have an investment here. I 
dont want to be an island with 
this home that weve lived in for 
fifteen, sixteen years now. 
Melvin Krall pointed out that 
not only students are being ex
ploited. We got a phone call last 
week from a real estate agent 
who said theres a house for sale 
on Forbes Avenue. It would be a 
very good house for rental pur
poses  you could put four stu
dents in there easily.  Landlords 
take advantage of student igno
rance of the law, while real estate 
agencies attempt to sell people 
houses on the basis of possible 
buyer ignorance.
University Attorney and Vice 
President for Development A1 
Brannick realizes the need to 
make students aware of the law, 
and says he plans a seminar in
the near future about living off 
campus.
Brannick says, however, that 
there are a lot of little nuances in 
these things. He mentions a time 
when he was trying to house four 
students in an apartment, and 
neighbors complained of over
crowding. However, the zoning 
law for that particular area also 
mentioned the legal use of a house 
as a college dormitory.
Some people say they wouldnt 
live anywhere else; seeing young 
people makes them feel young, 
says Brannick. The lifeblood of 
this area is students. Like it or 
not, theyre going to be here.
The Kralls say they have noth
ing against students, but the 
nicest of [them] make bad neigh
bors.... Theres a sociology in
volved here that all the students 
should open their eyes to, said 
Vivian.
Many students may ask why 
we just dont move. We are re
tired. Weve owned this property 
for a while. To move away from 
this neighborhood into a compa
rably sized home, we couldnt 
afford it. The finances, the dollars 
and cents concerning the stu
dents, are not dissimilar from our 
problems.
Few landlords seem concerned 
about the current crackdown. 
Recently, local landlords have 
been submitting misleading ad
vertisements to The Tartan. The 
February 14 issue advertises a 
house on Beeler Street that is 
comfortably suited for 5. In the 
February 21 issue, another house 
on Beeler is advertised as suited 
for 7. Both houses are in the OneFamily District, where all ten
ants must be related by blood,
marriage, or adoption  an un
likely arrangement among uni
versity students.
When told about the advertise
ments, Stromberg said she would 
follow up on it, by getting in 
touch with these particular land
lords. She says that the Coali
tion is not only designed to pro
tect neighborhoods, but students 
as well. She says that landlords 
are aware that students are will
ing to split costs between more 
than three people, and take ad
vantage of that willingness by 
hiking up prices.
Ann Steffy, a student at CMU, 
went to the comfortably suited 
for 5 house on Beeler recently. 
The landlord showed us three 
rooms and a dank basement. Then 
he opened a door and said, If you 
have someone extra, they can 
sleep in there. It was a closet. 
When asked her reaction, Steffy 
admitted she was still consider
ing the house. The real bedrooms 
were huge. CMU Housing would 
have packed six people into that 
place.
Jeffrey Cohen, one of the stu
dents living in that particular 
house, says that his landlord is 
guilty of neglect of the house. 
There were two weeds reaching 
the third-floor windows in front 
of the house. We kept asking him 
to cut them down and he would 
say, Those are trees. Finally, we 
cut them down ourselves. Cohen 
doesnt plan on living there next 
year, partly because of the cur
rent crackdown on overcrowding.
Landlords do not have to report 
their actions to the city. When 
housing more than three unre
lated people in a One-Family 
District house, they ask that only 
three tenants sign the lease.
The Kralls say that in such a 
situation, students are vulnerable 
to prosecution. If a landlord has 
a lease with three names on it, it 
is perfectly possible that the 
housing court could hold the three 
students that have signed the 
lease in the same position as the 
landlord; they would be in viola
tion essentially for subletting.

Tartan Assistant News Editor
In response to SEI protestor Vincent 
Eirenes charge that he was involved 
with Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) 
related research, Dr. E. Douglas Jensen 
recently defended his work in a state
ment called in to The Tartan.
Tm proud of what I have done, and 
stand by it, he said.
Doug Jensen should be ashamed of 
himself, Eirene responded.
Jensen had been named by Eirene as 
one of five CMU professors whose re
search is funded by SDI. One of the 
professors has since denied the charges, 
and two have claimed that their SDI 
projects have terminated.
Eirene released the office phone num
bers of each of the professors but Jensen, 
apparently because Jensen wasnt listed 
in the CMU Faculty/Staff Directory.
Jensen has moved to Boston, where he 
is vice president of research at Concur
rent Computer Corporation.
A non-trivial part of my research was 
funded by SDI, he told The Tartan.
Unlike some others, Im not disputing 
these charges. Im proud of them. Im 
perfectly #happy to admit I was doing 
research for SDI. I, and taxpayers as 
well, should be happy about this.
My research has immediate practical 
value outside SDI. Im not at all adverse 
to spending SDI money on things that 
have practical value.... Theres tons of 
money out there and why not use it?
I just wanted to say that Im proud of
what I have done, and I stand by it. 
Eirene spoke about his reaction to 
Jensens statement. I not only object to 
the clandestine spirit driving military 
contracts here on campus and at SDI, 
but the fact that when it does come to 
light, there are no objections raised.
I do not care if there are any practical 
spinoffs to SDI contracts. What good are 
spinoffs to offensive projects?
In reference to tons of money, there 
are no words strong enough to express 
my outrage. Presently, we need $33 bil
lion just to house the homeless, let alone 
to solve the social problems involved. 
There are tons of money to devise exotic 
ways to kill each other, but no money to 
care for the forgotten of our society. 
Eirene helps operate Duncan and Porter 
House, a shelter for the homeless on the 
North Side of Pittsburgh.
Eirene and Kevin Forsythe were ar
rested in December for chaining the en
trance to SEI. They have been subject to 
re-arrest since February for refusing to 
pay a $200 fine for the December arrest.
Student Dorm Council elects new officers
By JONATHAN LEVY
Tartan Contributing Editor
Junior Bryan Wong has been 
elected president of Student Dor
mitory Council (SDC). He replaces 
graduating senior Chris Williams.
In the February 22 executive 
board elections SDC also elected 
vice presidents for each of the 
four housing areas, a secretary, 
and a treasurer.
Juniors Pat Jeffries and Chris 
Murphy were re-elected as vice 
presidents for the Hill and Morewood Gardens, respectively. Jun
ior Joey Heafitz was elected vice 
president for the OaklandShadyside Apartments (OSA) and 
Mudge while sophomore Eric 
Hamilton was elected vice presi
dent of the Eastside which in
cludes the Doherty, Roselawn, and 
Margaret Morrison Apartments, 
as well as the new dormitory.
Sophomores Amy Shalikashvili 
and Matt Fraser were elected 
secretary and treasurer of SDC, 
replacing graduating seniors Jane 
Tshudy and Helen Santoro.
Wong said that SDC changed 
its constitution to redefine the 
areas because of the new dorm, 
even though it will not be ready 
until at least next January. The 
four areas now have roughly equal
numbers of residents, with 600 to 
750 students in each one. Wong 
added that the changes were also 
made in an attempt to match the 
divisions more closely with the 
areas covered by Housing Office 
area coordinators.
The new SDC officers terms 
began March 2, one week after 
the elections. Wong says he has 
no plans for major changes in 
SDC but does have some projects 
in mind. He would like to fill all 
the SDC positions so that there is 
one representative per resident 
assistant. Basically what Im 
trying to do is get equal represen
tation in SDC, he said.

u,cer was justified in using deadly 
force.
There is room for some im
provement, LaPaglia said. I 
dont feel that we have the major 
ni5roblems that they feel we have, 
"But as long as they perceive that 
we have these problems, we have 
to try to do something to change 
their perceptions and to change 
the areas where there are prob
lems.
" Austin said that the University 
"was presented with a petition 
^signed by students from the Uni
versity of Michigan, Princeton, 
Harvard, Stanford, and other 
universities at which minority
 students are facing similar diffi
culties. Failure to receive im
mediate attention and response 
to these issues, Austin warned, 
"Will... result in further action on 
the part of the black student body 
of Carnegie Mellon University.
' The petition that was presented 
to the University expressed out
rage at the actions of the Campus 
Police, and called the University 
hypocritical in its efforts to reCmit Afro-Americans to become 
'Students faculty and staff be
cause the University has no 
mechanism to make [minorities] 
"feel comfortable and safe in a 
kostile environment, no minor
ity advisor in student affairs, and 
-either a department of ethnic 
studies nor faculty qualified to 
, teach such courses. Spirits peti; tion also objected to the harass! ment of and discrimination 
! against working-class blacks who
 are employees of the University 
 by students and staff.
1 These problems must be ad! dressed before its too late, Austin 
; said. Carnegie Mellon must take 
; action to battle the overtly and 
! apparently racist system that it 
both supports and promotes. If 
1 action is not taken by your administration, action will be taken 
; by the students of color who at
tend your university. When ac
tion is taken by this oppressed 
I group, we will fully support them 
in their battle for human rights.
I Austin said that the University 
realized that there is a serious 
need for changes on campus. A 
status report will be released this 
week that will outline changes to 
better accommodate minority 
students on campus by dealing 
with areas such as police harass
ment, the availability of library 
materials, and consideration of 
ethnic studies courses.
; In a nutshell, Austin said, the 
University has given us its word 
that this issue would be looked 
into and that immediate action 
would be taken.
I According to Austin, the University neither denied nor ex
plained the actions of Campus 
Police, but did realize from the 
meeting with the students that 
some of the actions that were 
iaken were above and beyond the 
icall of duty. Austin said that they 
would consider what the status 
report said when it was released. 
JWe are demanding that some
thing be immediately done about 
this, she said, but would not 
specify any specific action that 
he expected the University to 
take.
Alleged incidents of harassment 
of black males by Campus Police
photo by Thomas Nichols
Spirit President Nicole Austin speaks at Thursdays press conference. Austin is an H&SS student senator 
and a senior applied history major.
spurred the controversy that led 
to Thursdays meeting.
David Turner, who graduated 
from the College of Fine Arts in 
1983, related an incident that he 
feels exemplifies Campus Police 
acting above and beyond the call 
of duty. As reported in a Tartan 
editorial, Turner said that the 
incident occurred when he re
turned to campus on January 6 to 
pick up a copy of his transcript. 
He wanted to stop at CFA while 
he was on campus to see some of 
his previous teachers.
Turner said he encountered Art 
Professor Bruce Breland and that 
they had a pleasant conversation, 
after which he left CFA and went 
to Doherty Hall. Upon leaving 
Doherty Hall, Turner was ac
costed by a CMU police officer 
who asked for identification and 
said that there had been a report 
of a suspicious person. Turner 
produced a drivers license, after 
which the officer asked Turner to 
accompany him to police head
quarters.
Turner later learned that no 
crime was committed at CFA that 
night and that Breland had re
ported him as a suspicious per
son. Turner said that the reason 
he attended the press conference 
was to see to it that the students 
who attend this University dont 
have to go through what I went 
through. It bothered me when 
they stopped me. I can only imag
ine if it bothered me and I had a 
term paper due the next morning. 
These students should not have 
to go through this.
Bowman felt that a large part of 
the problem lies in the fact that 
there are people reporting suspi
cious males not because of suspi
cious activities, but because 
theyre black. These are the kind 
of stereotypes that we have to 
work against at this university, 
and the administration has yet to 
progress on this problem.
According to Bowman, when 
black male students go to the 
gymnasium, its procedure to stop 
them and card them. Its gone to 
the extreme that if the ID isnt 
validated, the individual is kicked 
out of the gymnasium and might 
be kicked off the campus.

Austin described the sign at the 
gymnasium entrance that says 
that all who enter need to show 
ID, but that the only people who 
are being asked for identification 
are black males, and that even as 
the black males are producing 
their ID, their white male counter
parts are ... walking in. It is the 
black males that we have consis
tently seen being stopped to pro
duce identification.
Concerning the gymnasium 
situation, Chief LaPaglia said that 
either everyones going to have 
to be carded or no ones going to 
have to be carded. We have to 
demand fair and equal treatment 
for everyone.
LaPaglia said that his depart
ment certainly feels that we 
should be a part of the solution 
and not the problem. Obviously 
theres concern on the part of our 
black students that Campus Po
lice are not a part of the solution 
but we are a part of the problem. 
If they have that perception then 
we do have a problem.
LaPaglia said that a security 
report would be offered to stu
dents regarding the issues that 
were brought up in their meeting.
One of the issues concerning 
students was the grounds on 
which Campus Police stop what 
they call suspicious persons. 
According to LaPaglia, We dont 
just stop people, we have to have 
a reason. Normally its because 
we got a call.
LaPaglia indicated that the 
department needed to review its 
procedure concerning suspicious 
persons. He said that while the 
department has a'responsibility 
to respond to all calls, it must do 
so in a professional manner. We 
certainly cant be responsible for 
what is in the mind of the person
who calls. We hope that... if youre 
going to call about a suspicious 
person it should be because of 
their activities, not what they look 
like.
According to LaPaglia, the 
Campus Police Department is 
much more sensitive than most 
municipal police departments 
with which he has worked. Thats 
not to say we dont have some 
areas that we need some improve
ment in, some additional train
ing, and where we find we have 
problems, were going to change 
them, he said.
LaPaglia stressed that officers 
must explain their actions when 
stopping people on campus so as 
to avoid perceptions of discrimi
nation. I have to believe that the 
perceptions that our black stu
dents have ... are from the life 
experiences of the students with 
police across the country. I think 
you could talk to any black and 
they could relate to you at least 
one story where they were stopped 
by police and they werent happy 
about it.
He echoed the need for University-wide training in sensitivity 
toward minorities. It would make 
our job easier, he added.
Eight months ago, 18 of the 
departments officers received 
training in Cultural Awareness 
and Ethnic Intimidation. On 
March 31, 24 officers will begin 
similar training. LaPaglia will 
represent the Pennsylvania 
Chiefs of Police in the program 
and will be one of the speakers for 
the training. He emphasized the 
desire of his department to be 
proactive, not reactive on these 
issues.
LaPaglia doesnt feel that the 
problems are with the entire 
department. We may have a
couple of individuals who dont 
act professionally all of the time. 
That may be an area that we have 
to really concentrate on. I dont 
think that thats a very large 
percentage of our department at 
all. I wouldnt be surprised if we 
dont have one or two officers who 
act professionally all of the time. 
If they were identified as [doing] 
what is called ethnic intimida
tion, which is picking on someone 
because of race, nationality, or 
religion, they would be termi
nated.
Some of the problems reported 
had been investigated and it was 
ascertained that the officers acted 
properly, LaPaglia said. The other 
incidents that Spirit brought up 
he had not heard of before, and 
will be investigated. LaPaglia 
stressed that such incidents 
should be reported to him imme
diately so that a proper investiga
tion could be conducted.
LaPaglia recalled a case from 
October of 1987 in which several 
black students were coming out 
of Spirit House carrying some 
stereo equipment at night. Three 
officers checked the students 
identifications and the serial 
numbers on the stereos because 
of burglaries in that area over the 
previous few of weeks.
LaPaglia said that; he investi
gated that incident and that he 
felt the officers actions were jus
tified. He said that the students 
felt as if they were being har
assed, and that perhaps the offi
cers should have better explained 
what they were doing.
Bowman recalled the incident 
differently. A police officer called 
the three students over as they 
carried the equipment up the 
stairs to Hamerschlag House and 
asked to see their identification. 
As they were showing him their 
identification, two other police 
cars arrived, and the next thing 
they knew they were surrounded 
by eight cops. When one of the 
students said that he thought 
things were getting a little out of 
hand, the officer said that if you 
dont like it, you can leave, and 
not to piss him off. 
LaPaglia said that it was highly 
unlikely that eight officers were 
on the scene, because his investi
gation of the incident shows that 
there were three and because 
there arent that many officers on 
duty at one time.
Regarding police harassment, 
Austin said that we want a total
investigation of these reports and 
that if it is shown that these inci
dents have occurred due to some 
kind of racial intent, we want to 
make sure that the proper disci
plinary action is taken to make 
sure that the problem is corrected 
with the specific officers involved.
Austin said these incidents 
show that students on Carnegie 
Mellons campus are not prepared 
to deal with students from ethnic 
backgrounds. She called for a 
new University-wide core course 
that will deal with human rela
tions.
Vice President for Enrollment 
William Elliott said that a core 
course in human relations would 
definitely improve human rela
tions in the student body, but 
questioned whether a course 
needed to be implemented. Ac
cording to Elliott, the University 
held human relations training in 
the fall and will offer it again in 
the spring.
Regarding the lack of a person 
with a position of minority stu
dent advisor, Elliott said that 
there are currently advisors on 
campus who do a variety of things 
... there are blacks who are part of 
administrative groups who do a 
variety of things that include 
advising minority students. CMAP is certainly one such group.
Students cited the existence of 
a foreign student advisor as justi
fication for a minority student 
advisor.
Elliott said that the foreign 
student advisor is basically some
one who handles the mechanics 
of immigration. You could argue 
that there are financial aid advi
sors who advise students receiv
ing financial aid, or there ar6 
advisors over in health services 
that obviously advise everyone 
on health concerns. There are 
people who are around who are 
doing the same thing regarding 
minority concerns. The word 
advisor is attached to the foreigii 
student advisor. But that doesnt 
mean she or he is the only person 
that gives advice to foreign stu
dents, either. The question is if 
we have to have somebody called 
an advisor to say that we have 
someone to give advice.
The University has done a lot 
in the last twenty years, Elliott 
said. Well obviously have to do 
lot more. What these instances do 
is to bring to your attention that 
theres a lot of work left to do, for 
all of us.

By JONATHAN LEVY
Tartan Contributing Editor
Rebecca Drumm, the former 
editor-in-chief of The Duquesne 
Duke, has been convicted by a 
Duquesne University judicial 
board on two of the charges 
brought against her by the Stu
dent Government Association 
(SGA). She was acquitted of three 
others. Both sides plan to appeal.
In an 11 hour hearing that 
concluded at 12:45 am last Tues
day, the board of four students 
and two faculty members con
victed Drumm of failure to obey 
directives of university officials 
and failure to follow stated uni
versity policies.
She was acquitted of theft of 
university property, misuse of 
documents, and tampering with 
last years Duke editorial board 
elections.
Drumm was sentenced to pro
bation for one year or until gradu
ation. She is scheduled to gradu
ate in May. She was also barred 
from participation in any student 
organization, including TheDuke.
The SGA has also begun an 
investigation of at least one other 
member of The Duke editorial 
board. News Editor Sean Mc
Namara received a letter Friday 
evening asking him to produce 
records by Tuesday to account for 
$250hewas given hy The Duke to
purchase office supplies. He may 
face judicial board charges if he 
can not do so.
McNamara said that he spent 
the money properly and returned 
the change to The Duke. He criti
cized the fact that the letter ar
rived after the university offices 
had closed on Friday, leaving him 
only Monday to find the records.
SGA Senator Donna Marie Zotter said that McNamara is so far 
the only Duke staff member other 
than Drumm to be investigated 
and explained that the question 
over the money arose from his 
testimony at Drumms hearing.
Zotter told The Tartan that Mc
Namara can request an exten
sion of the Tuesday deadline and 
would probably receive it if he 
asked.
Duke attorney Joel Klein said 
that Drumm filed an appeal Fri
day to contest both charges on 
which she was convicted. He said 
that she plans to contest the 
charges on factual grounds.
The charge of failure to obey 
directives of university officials 
stems from an order last Spring 
by Father Sean Hogan, Duquesne 
vice president for student life, 
which instructed Drumm to close 
a controversial off-campus Duke 
bank account. The account re
mained open until last month 
when the SGA closed it
Klein claimed that The Duke
The charges against Drumm
The former Duquesne Duke Editor-In-Chief has been acquitted of:
theft of university property 
misuse of documents
tampering with last year's editorial board elections
She has been convicted of:
failure to obey directives of university officials 
failure to follow stated university policies
has documented evidence that 
Hogan promised to set up a meet
ing between Drumm and 
Duquesne President John E. 
Murray, Jr. He said that Drumm 
believed she did not have to close 
the account until after the meet
ing, which was never scheduled. 
She figured she could sit back 
and wait until something hap
pened, he said.,
Klein also said that Drumm 
would contest the charge of fail
ure to follow stated university 
policy. The charge stemmed from 
a press conference that The Duke 
held on campus without permis
sion from the universitys public 
relations department. Klein plans 
to argue that the press confer
ence was called by the entire-Du&e 
editorial board and that Drumm 
should not have been singled out 
for punishment.
Klein said that he thinks the 
penalty against Drumm should 
be reduced even if only one of the
CFA Dean searchers hold open talks
By STEWART LEVINE
Tartan Contributing Editor
Unlike previous searches for 
new deans, the five candidates 
for the position of Dean of the 
^College of Fine Arts are holding 
pen talks with the campus comjnunity.
The meetings are intended to 
allow the colleges faculty, staff, 
and students to play a greater 
role in the selection process. Each 
.candidate holds an informal ques
tion and answer session followed 
iy a speech to interested mem
bers of the campus community.
We wanted the broadest pos
sible input from faculty and stu
dents ... that is the only way we 
can find the best possible candi
date, explained Art Professor 
Herbert Olds, head of the search 
committee.
Not only are the meetings open, 
they are being reviewed by a group 
of students. Six CFA students 
attend the lectures and rate the 
candidates, giving their opinions 
pf each to the search committee.
T went to [Provost] Angel Joridan and said, I want a student 
committee/ and he said Okay, 
related search committee mem
ber Ingrid Bromberg.
Jordan was very enthusiastic 
about this new approach. This is 
the way it should be .... Its a very 
good idea. In the future, it [open 
meetings] will be done for all col
leges, he said.
The meetings seem to be suc
cesses; however, student atten
dance has been sparse. The prob
lem is most students dont know 
about this, claimed Bromberg. 
The meetings have been an
nounced through posters in CFA 
and Margaret Morrison Hall. 
Average student attendance has 
been about ten students per 
meeting, according to Bromberg.
The most recent of these lec
tures was given by candidate 
Barbara Anderson, the Drama 
Departments Bessie Anathan 
Professor, last week. Her hourP/wte ObO

charges is overturned.
The SGA was scheduled to have 
filed an appeal yesterday on the 
charge of theft of university prop
erty. Senator Kevin Friel said that 
part of the appeal comes from the 
SGAs contention that the charge 
was named incorrectly. He said 
that the SGA will charge that 
money from the The Dukes budget 
was misused, rather than stolen.
The charge is based on an audit 
of The Dukes off-campus account 
which produced evidence of a 
number of expenditures that the 
SGA considers inappropriate. The 
expenses cited by Friel included 
an expensive watch; several din
ners, including one last May, at 
the Hyatt, at which the The Duke 
spent a total of over $1300, with 
$700 going for alcohol; plane tick
ets to New York, Atlanta, and 
Chicago; personal prescriptions 
for Drumm; and a cruise on the 
Gateway Clipper a week before 
school began last Fall. The SGA
also claims that of $29,000 spent 
by The Duke, only $12,000 can be 
accounted for and only $6,000 was 
spent on legitimate newspaper 
expenses.
Friel said that the SGA knew of 
many of the expenditures last 
month but felt they could not 
reveal them without jeopardizing 
their case against Drumm. It was 
frustrating because we couldnt 
say anything for a long time, he 
commented.
Klein said that the The Duke 
can justify each of the expenses 
questioned by the SGA. He said 
that there have traditionally been 
two board dinners per year, and 
that Drumm has, in fact, tried to 
cut back on the amount of money 
spent at the dinners.
He explained that the plane 
trips were for seminars and com
petitions, and challenged an SGA 
accusation that an excessive 
number of people were sent by 
saying that in many cases, nu
merous sessions were held simul
taneously and The Duke needed 
multiple staff members present 
to attend all of them.
The watch, according to Klein, 
was a gift to Drumm from the 
editorial board. He said that it is 
a Duke tradition to give the de
parting editor-in-chief a present 
and said that an especially nice 
one is selected for editors who 
have served two terms, as Drumm
has. The previous editor, who also 
held the job for two years, re
ceived a Duquesne class ring.
Klein said that the prescrip
tions were for a medication to 
treat a rash Drumm developed 
from exposure to chemicals used 
in the production of one weeds 
paper. ,
He explained the Gateway Clip
per cruise as a kickoff party at the 
beginning of the school year and 
said that it occurred a week be
fore school started because The 
Duke staff returns to school early 
every year in order to put out the 
first issue of the paper. ;
In addressing the SGAs accu
sation that only $12,000 .of 
$29,000 spent by the The Duke 
could be accounted for, Klein 
called The Dukes bookkeeping 
system poor but said that the 
funds were not misused. He also 
pointed out that $5000 of the dif
ference was transferred into The 
Dukes university account by the 
SGA and that some of the money 
was spent prior to the time when 
Drumm became editor.
Drumm has not yet been re
placed by The Duke editorial 
board. McNamara said the paper 
will continue without an editorin-chief for the next three issues 
until next years editor, sched
uled to have been elected yester
day, takes over for the final issue 
of the year.
We wanted the broadest input from 
faculty and students. That is the only 
way we can find the best candidate
 Search Head Herbert Olds
long talk in Kresge Theatre was 
given to an audience of roughly 50 
people, mostly faculty.
Anderson was the third of the 
candidates to make presentations. 
Two external candidates: David 
Ball, Drama Department Head at 
Duke University; and Charles 
Diehl, Dean of the College of Arts 
and Humanities at Buffalo State 
College have already given their 
presentations. Yet to come are 
Design Professor Joe Belli and 
Dean John Unice of Ball State 
University.
Current Dean Akram Midani 
will be stepping down at the end 
of the school year. He has been 
Dean of CFA since 1972 and 
announced his retirement last 
April.
After taking a one-year sabbati
cal, Midani will return to CFA as 
a faculty member.

Robitshek said that circulation 
of the petitions stopped Satur
day. A meeting was held yester
day with the presidents of vari
ous student groups to decide how 
to present the results of the peti
tioning to the administration.
Student Ombudsman Michael 
Murphy commented that the 
petitions will only help the situ
ation with the Student Center. I 
think that [student involvement] 
is good, he said. He added that he 
is pretty confident that some of 
the names on the list come from 
faculty and staff members. Its 
an important issue on this cam
pus. Its not just a student center, 
its a University Center, said 
Murphy.
Communication, according to 
Murphy, is the one element that 
has been helped the most by such
There is no single priority. Everything 
that is relevant [to the student cen
ter], I said in my speech last week." 
 CMU President Richard Cyert
student protest. Along the same 
lines, Robitshek said, There were 
certain administrators that 
thought that students didnt care. 
The petition showed that students 
do care.
President Cyert, however, could 
not understand why the flurry of 
protest came about. The Center 
is still a vital part of the [Capital] 
Campaign, he said.
Even though almost every reso
lution, includingthe petition, calls 
for the Center to be made a top
priority, Cyert said, There is no 
single priority. Everything that 
is relevant [to the student cen
ter], I said in my speech last week, 
he said.
Murphy commented, It is hard 
to define priority. I dont think 
you can. Both Cyert and Murphy 
said that there are so many issues 
on campus that require attention 
that no single issue can be consid
ered the top priority of the 
University.
In a meeting last week of the
presidents of student organiza
tions, the group decided to draft a 
letter to Cyert requesting that he 
make the Center the schools first 
priority. According to Robitshek, 
who organized the presidents 
meeting, the letter will be incor
porated with the petitioned sig
natures.
At press time, the letters au
thors, Tartan Editor-in-Chief Karl 
Barnhart and H&SS Senator and 
Student Union non-editor Matt 
Ruben, were still in the draft 
stages of the letter.
We are going to press the fact 
that were willing to offer student 
help in fundraising, Barnhart
said. He said that Cyert must be 
made aware that students are 
willing to help resolve the issue. 
We would be willing to call the 
donors or help solicit contribu
tions  whatever would help, 
said Barnhart.
Murphy commented that there 
is one important issue that the 
student resolutions have not 
taken into account. We have to 
ask ourselves, said Murphy, 
 What are we willing to pay for 
it? As with any large project, other 
pressing issues will have to take a 
back seat. We have to decide 
where we are going to make sac
rifices.
Last week, the Pioneers made 
public a resolution criticizing the 
administrations delay of the 
University Center which sup
ported utilizing Carnegie Mellons 
$265 million endowment to build 
the building.
When you borrow against or 
dip into the endowment, youre 
mortgaging your future, Murphy 
said. If the school were to use the 
endowment for the Center and 
would not be able to pay it back, 
serious financial troubles could 
cripple the entire University for a 
long time. History doesnt treat 
that type of financing very well, 
Murphy said.

j]at he was not aware Council 
Meetings are closed, either.
J Devine was to discuss the confijentiality policy at the Council 
leeting scheduled for yesterday.

reach of customary confidential
ity, Fienberg and Devine offered 
J) release the transcript in a letr to the editors of the Student 
'nion and The Tartan which 
[ppeared in this paper last week. 
Friday, Devine gave The Tar
im an edited version of the tranIript containing, he said, the 
Relevant excerpts of comments 
e and Fienberg made about the 
Istory degree. Comments of other 
louncil members were removed 
om the transcript.
According to the transcript, 
fcenberg admitted that bachelor 
arts programs have been elimijated from the Social Sciences 
firough a conscious effort. But 
i also said that I dont care 
lout BA vs. BS, claiming he 
lily wants students to be able to
ask the kinds of questions that 
Clark [Glymour, head of the Phi
losophy Department] wants 
people to be able to ask.
What I heard was that Fien
berg thought it had been clear 
that we werent going to intro
duce new BAs, Ruben said. I 
havent dealt with the college just 
at that one meeting, and I know 
that my feelings were not irra
tional.
The full transcript received by 
The Tartan follows:
FIENBERG: The second issue 
to me is more important. It re
lates to the science as used in the 
title. Even if you disguise it and 
call it interdisciplinary history, 
Ive written a journal with that 
title and Im not fooled. Its still 
social science and history in one 
form or another.
I recall when I first joined the 
college, we had bachelor [of] arts 
programs in the social sciences. 
They have been eliminated. That 
was a conscious effort on the part 
of economics, social science, and 
psychology. But the only BA de
grees now being offered, I believe, 
are in English and history and a 
BA as a second major in language.
DEVINE: There is still a BA
option in psychology, but with the 
same math and stats require
ments. And there is one in eco
nomics as well.
FIENBERG: My biggest con
cern is that we create a major that 
is a way for students to side-step 
what I think of as the most impor
tant ingredients of our core cur
riculum that distinguishes our 
students from students at other 
institutions. The requirements 
are the secrets of calculus and a 
full year of stats.
One of the problems that Ive 
had with the History Department 
program, more broadly, was the 
fact that our students end up 
taking [stats] 209 but not 210, 
getting exposed to probability, but 
they dont get the statistics.
So, I would like, if were going to 
do this, and have a science pro
gram, to do it right. To do it as a 
bachelor of science program and 
have it be one that students work 
hard to get into, and have a real 
quantitative requirement. Not so 
much because the quantitative 
methods are going to be used as 
the social science tool within his
tory, but only with an understand
ing of quantitative methods can 
you put the softer social science
methods used in history into 
proper perspectives.
I would like to see our students 
graduate with the right perspec
tive on the work that they have 
done here. I dont want to change 
the courses that youre offering, 
but I do want to change what the 
faculty can expect students to 
bring to those courses. And there
fore [change] the maturity that 
they will have in looking at the 
[history] material when they enter 
into their junior and senior year.
FIENBERG: Thats the reason 
Im asking for the requirement, 
because I believe, in order to
appreciate what the qualitative 
methods can do and how they can 
be used, providing evidences in a 
historical setting, one needs to 
have the perspective that is 
brought by full exposure to stats, 
and also to the sufficient mathe
matics to allow you to judge what 
the alternative approach is.
There are major strengths from 
the qualitative approach and 
there are major weakeners. One 
can only judge the strengths and 
the weaknesses by having a requi
site background.
FIENBERG: The BS is....
DEVINE: No math and 36-101.
FIENBERG: Which is a onesemester non-calculus [statistics] 
course. My argument is that this 
is simply insufficient for some
body to have the adequate per
spective to judge this. The prob
lem is if you want to have two 
semesters of stats you have to 
have the one [of] calculus to go 
with it.
I dont care about BA vs. BS. 
What I care about is that [this is] 
a full year of essentially a course 
that allows you to judge empirical 
approaches to things and be able 
to ask the kinds of questions that 
Clark [Glymour] wants people to 
be able to ask.
Morewood Dining seeks missing trays

But the problem, says Cherry, 
is not simply limited to students 
hoarding trays. An ABM employee 
working in Morewood E-tower told 
Cherry that he regularly finds 
large amounts of trays as well as 
dishes and silverware in the hall

has begun retrieving such items 
from the trash as he sees them  
again by his own doing, as he is 
not required to do so.
In addition to annoyances and 
shortages, the tray problem is also 
expensive. At $3.29 a tray, the 
losses suffered by CMDS so far 
this semester are in the neighbor
hood of $6500. Including last 
semesters losses, the total stands 
at over $13,000, not including the 
cost of dishes and silverware.
In an effort to stem the tide bf 
thefts, Cherry says he had signs 
made and posted on the doors 
asking students not to take the 
trays out of the dining areas. The 
signs were stolen the same night 
they were put up.
In light of the present shortage, 
Cherry urges students who have 
trays in their rooms to drop them 
off in the Morewood dining room 
facilities. He promises that no 
questions will be asked.

As racial tensions mount on 
ampus, the need for a human 
relations coursebecomes more and 
more apparent. Implemented 
correctly, a three-unit course that 
gives its participants experience 
communicating with other people 
seems highly valuable  and 
highly neccessary.
We offer these suggestions for 
establishing such a course:
Credit. The course should be 
three units and graded on a pass/ 
fail basis. This way, grades will be 
de-emphasized and course mate
rial emphasized.
Experience rather than teach
ing. Since it is almost impossible 
to teach human relations, the 
course should be discussionand 
exercise-oriented, with small 
groups talking together rather 
than being lectured at. Students 
should learn from each other more 
than they should be forced to learn 
from a book. For a class like this, 
the students have as much to give 
as they have to gain.
Optional, not required. Most 
important is to make this a worth
while, valuable experience. Like 
any new class, it will probably 
take more than a year to get it 
right. Therefore, the biggest misitake the faculty could make is to 
make this a required class from 
the beginning. Take some time 
and iron out the bugs. The course 
could do more harm than good if 
npt administered correctly.
More than just freshmen. The
course should be open to every
one. Once it is established, fresh
men should be required to take it; 
however, no one should be turned 
away. This class is too important 
and too valuable to have prerequi
sites or limited enrollment.
Instructors. Just as itis impor
tant to make the class discussionoriented, a course of this caliber 
demands high-quality instructors. 
While that doesnt mean that every 
instructor should have a PhD, it 
does mean that every one should 
be an excellent communicator, 
listener, and moderator.
All minorities. To make this a 
truly valuable experience for all 
of Carnegie Mellons diverse stu
dents, all minorities should be 
addressed. Human relations is not 
a color-specific issue. The course 
should address needs particular 
to every color, religion, race, gen
der, and sexual orientation. While 
this makes the course more diffi
cult to administer, it makes the 
class more valuable for everyone.
In-class work. As we know, the 
CMU workload is horrendous. So 
that other courses dont have to be 
restructured to allow for a lot of 
homework for this class, in-class 
work should be maximized and 
homework should be minimized.
This class is possible and will be 
a valuable addition to CMU. We 
urge the administration and fac
ulty to consider our suggestions 
and move to make this class a 
reality soon.

Kudos to Student Government 
President Andrew Robitshek and 
the other student leaders who 
organized the petition supporting 
the University Center and are 
lobbying PresidentRichard Cyert 
.to make the Center the Univer
sitys first priority.
In under a week, nearly 25 per
cent of the student population has 
signed the petition demanding the 
Cyert administration do its ut
most to make the Center the focus 
of the current capital campaign.
Despite this widespread support, 
however, the administration an
swers by asking what we are will
ing to give up. What, it asks, are 
we willing to pay for such a large 
project?
We think that question has been 
answered. We pay the price every 
day.

Purpose of Greek Sing ignored by coverage
Editor:
I would like to address The Tartan and 
the Greek community on the issue of 
Greek Sing.
After reading your coverage on Greek 
Sing 89, it is very evident that we have 
lost our focus on what holding the event 
is all about. Unfortunately, the cause for 
which the performance is based has been 
lost in the competition among the houses. 
We are a Greek community that is sup
posed to be pulling together in order to 
accomplish a common goal.
It is a shame that the cause was barely 
mentioned in the newspaper and at the
Letters to the Editor
performance. Why didnt anyone briefly 
address the audience about the disease 
Multiple Sclerosis? Werent we there to 
learn more about what we were perform
ing for?
The CMU Greek community received 
an award for which its title was not even 
mentioned in the coverage. Does anyone 
wonder where the plaque will be placed? 
Also, it is equally disgraceful that after 
Greek Sing occurs, there is no follow-up 
as to where the money goes or who it
helps. Is it not part of the chairmans jd 
to do this?
Hypothetically, we are helping peop! 
who are less fortunate than us, yet whs 
we deem as important is who will receiv 
a first place trophy, and who will hat 
the best party afterward. It is unfortii 
nate that we only went half-way wi| 
Greek Sing. Maybe these important is 
sues should be considered before  
decide to represent another charity will 
out giving it our full attention.

Junior, H&SS
Senior proposes solution for the University Center
suffered because Carnegie Mel
lon built Skibo Hall, a poorlyplanned, ugly attempt at a uni
versity center. Two years ago, the 
University seemed to be commit
ted to improving the quality of 
student life. Is the quality of life 
irrelevant now? Where has that 
commitment gone?
The question the administration 
should be asking is not what we 
want to put into the back seat to 
concentrate on the University 
Center. Rather, we have to ask 
ourselves how long can we as a 
university afford to put the Cen
ter in the back seat.
We students are willing to do 
our part. If that means calling 
alumni, soliciting potential do
nors, or writing letters, we are 
willing to help.
What we are not willing to sit 
back and wait any longer.
Editor:
Being a senior, I am frustrated by the 
increasing amount of conflict between 
students and the administration in gen
eral and particularly over the long-prom
ised University Center. I believe that a 
quick civics lesson (and a small dose of 
pragmatism) will help alleviate the prob
lem.
If you look at any politician, you will 
usually find that he or she is incredibly 
responsive to the requests of his or her 
constituents. The practical purpose of 
this is that doing a good deed for a con
stituent, such as tracking down a late 
Social Security check, will get the politi
cal figure remembered by that constitu
ent in a positive way. Thus, when the
next election rolls around, the constitu
ent will be inclined to go around to friends 
and neighbors and spread the tale of the 
good deed which the politician performed, 
presumably increasing the number of 
votes that politician receives.
At CMU, or any college or university 
for that matter, the administration and 
students should have a similar relation
ship; the administrators are hired to 
serve the students needs and take care 
of the business that the students dont 
have time for. The only difference is that 
administrators are not elected by the 
students, and, since their jobs arent in 
jeopardy every 2,4, or 6 years, they seem 
to have forgotten the fact that they are 
supposed to represent the interests of
the students. At least, this is what alltl 
complaining of recent weeks seems 
indicate.
To alleviate the ever-increasing bi 
blood between students and administc 
tors at CMU, I propose that the latt 
group take action in the directions th 
students are demanding. This won 
increase general happiness arous 
campus, since there should be less I 
students to complain about. It also n 
increase the level of respect the studen 
have for administrators. TaMng su 
action is the only politically wise alti 
native for CMUs administrators.

Fienberg defends position on H&SS BA/BS degrees
The following is an open letter to Seth 
Kaufman in response to his open letter 
printed last week to Dean Fienberg.
 Ed.
Dear Mr. Kaufman:
I write in response to your recent open 
letter in The Tartan [Student questions 
Dean Fienbergs intentions 3/14]. You 
ask a large number of interesting and 
valid questions. I will try to answer some 
here and I invite you to come visit with 
me to discuss these and related issues 
further.
First, as Jay Devine and I noted in our 
letter published in The Tartan last week, 
the accounts in the Student Union and 
The Tartan are incorrect in several re
spects and the impression they offer is 
clearly misleading. For example, I did 
not say that the Colleges BA programs 
were being phased out and the taped 
transcript of the College Council meet
ings which is used to prepare the min
utes verifies this.
The proposed program in social sci
ence history was brought to College 
Council for discussion and there was 
broad agreement that the BA program 
was not ready for implementation with
out a further consideration of the pre
requisites for key courses. New majors 
are not simply added because subsets of 
faculty propose to teach them or because 
students desire them. Rather, we exam
ine with some care the structure of pro
posed programs, the courses involved, 
prerequisites, the ability of departments 
to offer a coherently structured and sound 
curriculum, and so on. Proposals are 
often reformulated and revised follow
ing College Council discussions.
You asked: How does a second semes
ter of statistics and a semester of calcu
lus give a student a better perspective? 
The quantitative prerequisites that re
ceived the greatest discussion with re
gard to the social science history major
were those associated with the design 
and analysis of empirical research stud
ies. There is a sophomore level H&SS 
sequence in statistics that embodies 
much of this material, Statistics 36-209/ 
210, and it in turn has a one-semester 
calculus prerequisite. No alternative 
course(s) currently available would pro
vide equivalent background. Statistics 
36-209, which is primarily a course in 
probability, is not sufficient to meet the 
needs of students who are actually expected to understand statistical met 
ods and their application.
The majority of those at the Counf 
meeting believed that, in the absence 
such background in statistical methoa 
students would not be able to assess! 
strengths and weaknesses of the empi 
cal base underlying the social scien 
theories and hypotheses used in vario 
courses in the proposed major. I cono 
in that judgment. Thus, the questi 
continued on page
Columnist answers critics charges
Editor:
Nicholas Kushmericks response 
[Reagan not as popular as columnist 
Fartro thought, 2/14] to my column [So 
long Ron, you will be missed, 2/7] pres
ents a good example of how facts can be 
twisted. I stated, Anytime a president 
who has achieved a 63 percent popular
ity rating for eight years of service leaves, 
it is sad. Reagan managed to pull the 
highestpopularity in thelast30 years.... 
Mr. Kushmerick responded by saying, 
One point (the Reagan popularity sta
tistic), however, is clearly erroneous, and
I cannot help but bring it to his atten
tion. He then cited statistics that meas
ured President Reagans popularity 
during his first term. Summarizing, he 
said, Thus by any of the measures  
average popularity, peak popularity, and 
popularity low pointMr. Fartros claim 
is unsubstantiated. But my column 
referred to Reagans entire presidency, 
eight years, not just his first term.
He did try to make the reader believe 
that those statistics had a relationship 
to Reagans entire presidency: However, 
I think that the events of Reagans sec
ond term ... clearly indicate that a pro
found turnaround which might validate 
Mr. Fartros claim did not happen. 
Therefore, using Mr. Kushmericks rea
soning, Reagans total popularity 
which he did not statistically refute 
should be lower than his first term pes 
cited by Kushmerick at 68 percent. Hci 
my 63 percent statistic was lower th 
Reagans first term peak, contradict! 
his claim that my point was clearly 
roneous.
Now that I have dispelled his mislei 
ing generalizations, I will list the pe! 
nent statistics. On December 27, 1 
the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette ran 
page story citing Reagans popularit)' 
66 percent. The story came from 
Associated Press (AP) News Service,! 
the popularity survey was done nati 
ally by the Media General Associi! 
Press. The article stated, ...an ' 
whelming two-thirds (of Amerio 
approved of the way Reagan has done 
job overall and said history will viewi 
positively, and 55 percent said he! 
bettered the nation.
Additionally, New York Times 
Inauguration week gives Reagan 
per cent favorable exit rating..., acci 
ing to National Review (2/10/89). Anoi 
National Review For the Record 
said, ...Ronald Reagan will leave of 
with a 63 per cent popularity rating, 
highest for any President since FD 
death in office during WW II, says P 
ster Richard Wirthlin. (1/27/89).

If the CFA is so great, why is this campus so ugly?
Coincidences 
sric W. Leuliette
It must have been the sunny 
yeather, but it suddenly dawned 
on me that I spend at least twenty 
hours a week in classrooms which 
|dont have windows. Conse
quently, Ive become convinced 
(that Carnegie Mellons buildings 
|are not made for humans.
Dont get me wrong  I like 
ivalking around this campus and 
I like how its laid out. But when 
j enter a building, I feel like Im in 
i architects nightmare.
The feeling starts with my dorm, 
Boss Hall. Because of fire regula
tions, I have to pass through five 
[doors to get from the outside to 
my room. Then, to be the least bit 
Social or to get air circulating in 
ny room, I have to prop my 6000- 
bound door open with a dental 
loss box.
1 Like much of this campus, Boss 
|ias been redecorated to achieve 
decor of a hospital. Plaster 
falls, pastel colors, and odd light 
xtures have spread to Hamburg 
kail, the Baker 140 cluster, the 
University Computing Center, 
[and new classrooms throughout 
jampus.
['My discomfort with buildings
continues when I go to The Tar

Spring Carnival and all that it entails^
Believe it or not, Spring Car
nival is only less than a month 
away.
Im already looking forward 
to it: the Gravitron, the parties, 
and going on the Gravitron right 
after going to a party (done only 
once). Carnival is the one chance 
we have to pretend that we went 
to a party school like Slippery 
Rock instead of Carnegie Mel
lon. Ive been here three years, 
and I still do not remember a 
complete Saturday night of 
Carnival.
The things we do on Saturday 
are scary, but if you want to see 
something really spooky, wan
der around campus around 9 
am on Carnival Sunday. That 
was the scene that inspired 
George Romero to do Night of 
the Living Dead.
Unfortunately, Carnival does 
have its down side. This is the 
time when the rest of Pittsburgh 
comes to us, I can clearly pic
ture the mob from Taylor-Allderice High School on the Mid
way, too much makeup and 
mousse, frosted jeans, and 
scheming to a find a way to get 
beer from a college student.

The high schoolers arent so bad 
when you work booth. No one 
spends more money than the six
teen year-old boyfriend who has 
to prove his manhood by winning 
your game, even if it takes twenty 
tries.
Right now Im not worrying 
about booth; Ive got buggy on the 
brain. Im competing for the first 
time, and it really is an eye-open
ing experience.
Well, its more an eye-opening 
experience when you can get your 
eyes open. One of the unwritten 
rules of buggy seems to be that 
you can only practice for it at a 
time when youre supposed to 
sleep.
Weekday practices are at mid
night. Now I realize that its a 
rare night when you can go to 
sleep before midnight, but theres 
a principle involved here. These 
arent so bad though; its freerolls 
that really get to me.
Freerolls must be the Carnegie
Mellon equivalent of Chine2 
water torture. At 6:30 am on 8 
weekend morning I expect to be 
sleeping off (or with) the un
pleasant (or pleasant) resulF& 
of the night before. Instead I get 
a wake up call informing methat the first rolls are in ten 
minutes so would I kindly gejb^ 
my butt in front of GSIA.
Rolls are one of the few times1 
when appearance does not mat-C 
ter. If you show up clean shaveil, I 
its a clear sign that you got 
more than four hours of sleep 
the night before. That wont win* 
you many friends, and does not 
reflect well upon your social life*.^ 
Besides, in the time youre 
shaving, the last doughnuts ap&, 
being eaten.
Theres only three more weeks' 
of rolls; I think I can make it. 
However, if you see someone 
sleep-pushing a buggy in classy 
itll be me - please dont wake 
me up.

Then weve got this whole situ
ation with the assault weapons. 
Bush has suspended imports but 
is holding off on banning the guns 
entirely while the Bureau of Alco
hol, Tobacco, and Firearms inves

mate hunting weapons. Let me 
give you a hint, guys. While it 
may be true that you can use an

is what
people had in mind when they 
named them assault rifles. It 
seems to me that you are sup
posed to use them to assault 
somebody, and probably not by 
hitting the person over the head 
with the butt.
To be fair though, its not just 
the U.S. government thats been 
acting funny. Ayatollah Khomeini 
is doing his best to dispel the 
rumor that there is any sanity in 
Iran.
I hope Salman Rushdie fakes 
his own death and collects the 
money himself. All he would have 
to do is blow up some empty build
ing. The police (who would proba
bly be in on the plan) would find a 
badly burned body (borrowed from 
the morgue) and identify it as 
Rushdies. Somebody else could 
collect from the Ayatollah and 
Rushdie would live the rest of his 
life in luxury, surrounded by body 
guards paid with Khomeinis 
money.
Sure, its a screwy idea but Im 
starting to think thats how you 
have to do things these days. In 
fact, if he pulls it off, Rushdie 
should consider politics.

Physical Plant 3/14]:
Big snow. Big, big snow. White

When snow forms, the amount

I could be wrong, though. Dean

This surprises me. Any statisti

change the wet, drippy BA, its 
elements careening chaotically off 
of one another, into solid BS, in 
which each element is firmly 
locked to the next, and interac
tion among them turns to stag
nant bonds. Then, we can form 
analogies in other courses which 
will fit accepted statistics and 
calculus theorems. Thoughts will 
be as clear as ice, or maybe as 
clear as the formula which de
scribes ice formation (which re
quires a physics course, but luck
ily we are already required to 
take this). Is this expanding 
knowledge, or standardizing it? 
We already take a semester each 
of stats and calc. If we want to 
take more, we have that option.
In the midst of all this snow, a 
surprise: a small patch of ice in 
the wrong place at the right time. 
Snow and ice. Everywhere, even 
on the tops of buildings. People 
slipping, everywhere. Falling 
snow: Falling ice. Watch your 
head: its a dangerous world we 
live in.
We are often limited to apply
ing models to explain situations 
and make decisions. The model 
Dean Fienberg uses says that 
statistics has relevancy to every
one, so we should have to take 
more courses in it. If this goes 
through, no doubt that hell say 
that statistics is important be
cause it is required, and required 
because it is important. The model 
you use says to wait until an acci
dent occurs before responding. 
You both end up stumbling a bit, 
and you both suffer minor bruises. 
Fienberg dwells on the improprie
ties of printing comments from 
closed council sessions, and you 
call Physical Plant negligent. This 
is all after the fact.
Ms. Tanzer, do you really need 
someone to blame for Act-Of-God 
meteorological phenomena and 
the physical law which says ice is 
slippery? Dont take the law into 
your own hands, takeem to court.
So you slipped and fell on a 
patch of ice you chose to ignore. 
You say that it is quite possible 
that I could have been there all 
night. Maybe a night alone with 
the elements would have helped 
you to realize that the snowy mess 
wasnt limited to the campus. 
Maybe you could even have 
crawled around the buildings and 
watched the men as they plowed 
the cut with their tractors and 
spread salt to change the snow 
back to water. You could have 
screamed curses at them as the 
sun rose, whenever they got
within hearing range.
You say that someone was 
likely to get hurt: after-the-fact 
analysis and pointing fmgersj 
because someone ended up bein^ 
you.
I was lucky, you say. Some 
people say that you cant leave 
luck to chance.
In so much snow, single pointd 
are often overlooked. Couldnt you 
have helped? If youre going to 
leave Physical Plant alone before , 
then leave Physical Plant alone; 
after. Its not fair. You could have 
told them. You saw the problem.; 
You were there.
Look beyond your own nose.' A, 
simple phone call could have saved 
you the agony of minor bruises! 
and a sore back. You could have 
even been rude to them on the 
phone, if you wanted to. Beep; 
beep boop beep. Only four num-; 
bers, thank Centrex.
What? Look the number up,; 
maybe? God, what an inconven-', 
ience. , !
Much easier: Hmm. Someone^ 
could get hurt. They should do; 
something about that. Then walk; 
away. Carefully. (Dont forget yojir; 
lucky backpack.)
Negligence, indeed. [

p7The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  21 March 1989
Dean calls for vertical structure of education
sible fashion to most items 
brought before the Council. I do 
not believe that College Council 
is intended to serve the same 
functions as the U.S. Congress, 
and thus comparisons of the sort
continued from page 10 posturing often represented by
addressed by the Council was not the accounts in the student press, 
whether we should have BAs or Both students and faculty con^BSs, but rather what training tribute in a positive and responshould students bring to the study 
of the social sciences as they are 
used at the interface with his
tory.
~ In the social sciences more 
broadly, students need to have 
. ^ sufficient scientific 
^"and empirical re
search training to 
understand the sci. entific basis of the 
material they study.
The colleges BS re
quirements meet 
what I believe should 
be the basic needs of 
"students studying in the social 
''sciences at Carnegie Mellon.
The ultimate responsibility for 
the H&SSs curricular offerings 
lies in my office and I am happy to 
be held accountable. 
20%. This is what I explained in 
my interview with The Tartan 
even though the impression may 
be otherwise. In fact, on the basis 
of units taught per faculty, Sta
tistics ranked third in the Uni
versity.
There is much written about 
what C. P. Snow called the two 
cultures, in which he called for 
humanists to 
learn about the 
sciences and sci
entists to learn 
about the humani
ties. The crossing 
of the bridge be
tween the two cul;  . tures happens
more often from 
the science side to that of the hu
manities. A careful reading of
suggested in your letter are inap
propriate. The ultimate responsi^These prerequisites were origibility for the H&SSs curricular Snows essay on the topic and 
nally developed collectively by offerings lies in my office and I am related commentary suggests the 
faculty across the College and are happy to be held accountable.
My remarks about the Statis-^regularly reviewed by the College 
. , Council. Their rationale is der, ^scribed in the Undergraduate 
' .Catalog.
The College Council is account
able for its actions but the contri
butions of individuals to discus
sion are not attributed in the 
minutes made available to oth
ers. This practice allows an hon
est and open airing of the intellec
tual issues and avoids the kind of
tics Department, that were ex
cerpted by The Tartan, related to 
numbers of students taught. This 
is, in part, a function of the num
ber of faculty available to teach. 
As of 1987, the latest date for 
which figures are conveniently 
available, the number of units 
taught per faculty in Statistics 
exceeded that for each of the other 
departments in the H&SS by over
need for humanists to be able to 
cross the bridge in order to under
stand the sciences on their own 
terms. A criticism often made of 
the humanities is that in them, 
unlike in the sciences, learning is 
horizontal with knowledge of one 
area not necessarily serving as 
the basis for the study of the next. 
Scientists who dabble in the 
humanities often fail to see the 
extent of the vertical structure of 
knowledge in many fields where
the prior study of some topics are 
essential for an adequate under
standing of others.
In your letter you comment that 
In a philosophy class the ap
proaches are as many and varied 
as the people in the class. For 
me, a humanities class in which 
everyone had his or her own 
approach is one that has failed to 
build on what should be a shared 
knowledge base, and it is typical 
of a setting where knowledge is 
horizontal rather than vertical. 
Courses without -prerequisites 
encourage horizontal learning 
and we have attempted to move 
away from such practices in 
H&SS, especially for junior and 
senior level courses.
I believe that a vertical struc
ture for courses and knowledge, 
which you appear to challenge in 
your letter, does not prevent 
people from questioning assump
tions and periodically discarding 
theories and perspectives in fa
vor of alternatives. Rather it 
strengthens their ability to do so, 
in a thoughtful and informed man
ner.
I hope that this response an
swers some of your questions. 
Sincerely,
Stephen E. Fienberg

out of 66 percent, 68 percent, and 
,, $3 percent, I chose the most con. ..s.ervative rating (no pun ini . tended).
So Reagans popularity was 
certainly over 60 percent, but 
,n there is still the matter of Reagan 
being the most popular president 
 the last 30 years. Without doing
.Additional research, ignoring 
Jlichard Wirthlins statement 
above, and giving Mr. Kushmer"Jicks statistics the benefit of the 
doubt, that leaves the Eisenhower 
a.nd Kennedy average popularities  69 percent and 71 percent,
, respectively  at a level greater
than Reagans 63 percent. But 
Kennedys popularity was not 
measured for even one full term; 
he served less than three years 
(1960-1963). If I disregard Ken
nedys popularity on the grounds 
of brevity, then I am left with 
Eisenhowers presidency ending 
28 years before 1988. I will con
cede to saying Reagan was the 
most popular president in the last 
28 years instead of the last 30.
I would like to point out one 
other distorted piece of informa
tion in Mr. Kushmericks re
sponse: Im sorry that Mr. Fartro 
has only NBC, ABC and CBS to 
inform [himself].  My point in
mentioning that I had only NBC, 
ABC, and CBS to inform me was 
that when a person has only liber
ally-biased news sources, they 
tend to support the liberal candi
dates. If I had only these sources 
to inform me, I probably would 
have never supported Reagan.
Granted, I was a little unclear. 
However, Mr. Kushmerick should 
be delighted that I have looked 
far beyond the network news 
during the last five years. Here is 
a list of the publications I read 
regularly: The Pittsburgh PostGazette, The Pittsburgh Press, The 
New York Times, USA Today, The 
Los Angeles Times, The Christian
Science Monitor, New Republic, 
Ms. Magazine, National Review, 
The Humanist, U.S. News and 
WorldReports, Concerned Women 
for America, Chalcedon Report, 
Biblical Worldview, Last Days 
Magazine, InterVarsity Magazine, 
Expression, and People of Des
tiny. Those last six are special 
interest Christian publications.
I appreciate the fact that Mr. 
Kushmerick took the time to re
spond; however, I hope that he 
more thoroughly verifies his data 
next time.

security changes to directory
Letters to the Editor
Editor:
As one of the creators and im
plementors of Whos Who at 
CMU Id like to respond to the 
recent article in The Tartan [A 
Phi O raises security concerns 
about on line directory 3/7].
First, Id 
like to 
thank A 
Phi O for 
their efuinMw 
h0ad0 
brought to 
light the 
security 
holes in 
the direc
tory and 
for sharing 
some of the
precautions which they take in the CBook. Several steps are being 
taken to make the directory 
more secure without losing too 
much ease of use. For instance, 
we will add several dummy 
names to help identify those 
who have used the directory to 
create a mailing list, and, we 
will add a copyright notice to 
the entry screen.
Second, Id like to say a few 
words about the origins and mo
tivation underlying Whos Who. 
One of the recommendations of 
the Quality of Life Task Force 
was that there needs to be 
greater communication among 
the members of the campus 
community: students, faculty, 
and staff. In particular, stu
dents want to know more about 
the faculty.
The directory was originally 
conceived as a file of faculty bio
graphical information. As we 
talked with faculty, they indi
cated a desire to know more
about the students. The ide; 
evolved to one of a director, 
which would contain informi 
tion like research and academj 
interests, hobbies, member 
ships, and so on. Of course, 
facilitate communication, direc 
tory information like addresse; 
and phone numbers is an eg 
sential first step.

Greek Sing Chairman criticizes The Tartan for its story and editorial on the event
; Editor:
1 "Let me begin by acknowledging 
' the fine piece of writing done by 
Tartan Contributing Editor Stew 
Levine on Greek Sing 1989. I 
compliment him on his writing 
-and willingness to stand back 
stage and get the true feel of the 
'evening. End of compliments. 
""Now let me expose the Tartan 
"Staff as the hypocrites that they 
really are.
You praised the move to the 
Mosque and expressed your ap
proval of the change in your post
show editorials However, when I 
requested that ;an article on the
Letters to the Editor
site change be printed the week 
before the show, I was told by a 
member of The Tartan staff that 
an article could not possibly be 
written because it would be con
sidered free advertising. The 
staff member continued to insult 
me by telling me to place an ad in 
the paper if I wanted to sell more 
tickets. Free advertising? Youve 
got to be kidding me! Greek Sing' 
is a charity event, in case youve 
forgotten, so theres no way that 
you can justify the free advertis
ing claim. I would think that 
students would want to do what
ever is possible to help raise more 
money for MS. Obviously, The 
Tartan didnt.
Another thing that thoroughly 
disgusted me was the way that 
the editorial brought out the prob
lems that occurred the night of 
the show. I felt that it was com
pletely unnecessary and further 
depicted The Tartans poor j udgement and obvious inability to 
accept the fact that the Greek 
Community can do something 
positive and beneficial. Judging 
by the write-up, your staff mem
bers spent all of their time look
ing for problems and missed all 
the wonderful performances.
For the record, five press passes 
were issued toTheTartan to cover 
Greek Sing. In reading the less 
than 1/2 page article on the show 
and glancing at the seven pic
tures, I saw the work of at best 
two people. Many students on 
campus shared my disappoint
ment with the coverage. Greek 
Sing was one of the most impor
tant occurrences on campus last 
week, but received no first page 
coverage.
This years show raised approxi
mately $8,000 for MS. Call me 
stupid, but I would consider this a 
top story since it was the largest 
student charity event of the year. 
I would strongly encourage The 
Tartan to run another story on 
the event and print more of the 
pictures which were taken by the 
photographers present.
SAE, the overall champion, had 
a mere two sentences written 
about their performance. I look 
back at previous Greek Sing is
sues of The Tartan and see a com
plete section devoted to the event, 
including pictures from every 
show, and a complete paragraph
to accompany each. If this yea 
coverage is any indication of 
future, Tartan staff membersc 
plan on paying to attend fiiti 
performances. Coveringthisevi 
is a privilege, not a right. Kf 
that in mind for next year.
One last thing, my last nami 
spelled Michel. Id appreciaii 
it was spelled properly in 
future.
Thank You.

Were good men 
Charlie Brown
One of my favorite literary 
characters has always been 
Charlie Brown.
I have read the comic strip for 
what seems like forever. I wait 
with baited breath every 
Thanksgiving and Christmas to 
see the Peanuts television 
specials.
Ive often thought that Ive 
had a lot in common with 
Charlie Brown. Growing up 
watching those cartoons and 
comparing them with my own 
life, I found a great deal of
 similarities. Our (mine and 
-Chucks) first crushes were on 
little red haired girls. Neither 
of us can fly a kite, and each of 
us has a very strange dog.
When I started working in the 
theater, I often used mono
logues and songs from the 
shows Youre a Good Man 
Charlie Brown and Snoopy as 
audition pieces. One of my 
favorite songs is called The 
Baseball Game.
1 This song has a very special 
meaning for me because Charlie 
Brown sings about how he can 
never quite manage to win a 
baseball game. He loves to play 
baseball, but he manages a very 
bizarre (and bad) group of play
ers. What can one expect when 
the best player on the team is a 
dog named Snoopy.
The similarities between us 
became most evident when I be
came the manager of my own 
team  an intramural team 
here at CMU.
I love sports. I play baseball 
with the Baseball Club, and in 
my three years as a student 
have partaken in almost every 
IM sport offered. Its a great 
program, and I was anxious to 
form a team with the people I 
work with so we could work off 
some of the tension we build up 
on the job.
I prevailed in convincing The 
Tartans editorial board to form 
an IM team. I was appointed 
manager and quickly began or
ganizing games and practices.
We took our turn at volleyball 
and met with limited success.
We won one game  a forfeit 
because the other teams 
players all had mid-terms the 
next day.
We practiced and played some 
other sports including basket
ball. We played some very hard, 
tough games. In the end, we 
wound up with the worst record 
in all three leagues, 0-6.
Last week, our team got 
beaten by one point in the first 
round of the 3-on-3 tournament. 
Thats when I got reflective!
I know the goal is to have fun; 
not to solely concentrate on win
ning, but we havent won (legiti
mately) a game all year! Thats 
gotta be some kinda record, 
right? A dry spell is one thing, 
^nt geez laweeze!
Maybe Im overreacting but 
1 m rapidly losing patience, con
fidence, and the soles on my 
>ver-used sneakers.
I used to think that we just 
nad a lousy team. But then I 
realized that fate, not our 
playing, is the reason for our 
torrow. Every time we go out 
nto the field or court, I have 
his vision of Lucy yanking the 
football out from under my foot 
as Im about to kick it.
Oh well, ven if nice guys like 
jChuck and myself do finish last, 
j* d rather have it that way than 
and have to be a jerk about

The CMU mens tennis team is 
looking forward to a successful 
season as they return in top form, 
with a new style, and a lot of hard 
practices behind them. Head 
Coach Rich Schemes stated, We 
have a tougher schedule this year. 
Were doing a lot more to prepare 
than we have in previous years.
The team starts the new season 
without two of its best players. 
Rob Schlackman graduated last 
year, and Dave Dillon decided not 
to play this year.
The teams top returning play
ers include four seniors: Keith 
Grumet, Graham McAfee, Dar
ren Kaplan, and Jay Stevens. Also 
playing singles are Mike Serence 
and two newcomers, Matt Davis 
and Nicolas Sagna. Sagna is an 
exchange student from Switzer
land majoring in physics. I think 
hes going to be a strong player 
this year, Scheines commented.
The Tartans also have an excel
lent doubles field to show this 
year. We have four really good 
doubles teams but we can only 
field three. The top two return
ing doubles teams are Grumet 
and McAfee and Kaplan and Ste
vens. The other two doubles teams 
consist of all newcomers: Sagna 
and Rick Lee and Davis and Russ 
Riben. CMU has good competi
tion within itself as Scheines 
revealed, It looks like its going 
to be hotly contested between 
them.
The Tartans had an impressive 
season last spring. They came in 
fifth at the University Athletic 
Association (UAA) championship 
tournament, with Kaplan and 
Dave Dillon winning the doubles
consolation match and Stevens 
winning the consolation match as 
the number five seed.
At the Presidents Athletic 
Conference (PAC) tournament, 
the Tartans took second behind 
John Carroll University. Kaplan 
won the tournament for number 
three singles, and Stevens won 
the tournament for number five 
singles. Scheines stated, We 
would like to avenge that loss this 
year. We would like to beat John 
Carroll and win the PACs.
Scheines has worked the team 
a lot more this year in prepara
tion for the season by introducing 
indoor practices. The team will 
also take an excursion to Hilton 
Head Island for spring break 
where they will play against five 
teams in four days, many of whom 
are top-rated schools.
In addition to playing in the 
PACs and the UAAs in April, the 
Tartans are playing local Divi
sion I teams such as Fairmont 
State, Westminister, Pitt, and 
Robert Morris.
The team will also be introduc
ing a new style of play this season 
by moving from the baseline to 
the net.
Were more of a serve and vol
ley type team than a baseline 
team, especially Stevens and 
McAfee, who are almost solely 
serve and volley players now, 
Scheines said.
With their new style of play and 
the tough practice coming up at 
Hilton Head, the team hopes to 
improve their standing at the 
UAAs and the PACs.
Kaplan confidently stated, We 
are playing at a higher level than 
we have been before. This is the 
best team that the seniors have 
had in all four years!

Three was the name of the game 
in IM sports as the three point 
shoot out, three on three basket
ball and the foul shooting compe
tition all came to a close last week.
Starting on Thursday, the first 
of the three specialty basketball 
events began. The three point 
shootout consisted of twenty-five 
shots taken from three point 
range: five shots from the top of 
the key circle, five from each wing 
and five from each side of the 
basket along the baseline. The 
top three shooters from the first 
round advanced to the champion
ship round, which was identical 
to the first with respect to the 
number and location of the shots.
After the first round, Gregg 
Orrill of The Asylum was in first 
place with 17 out of 25. RayFratto 
of PAD took second place, sinking
15 of 25 shots. Tying for third 
place were Jeff Richards of ECE 
and Kevin Lee; both managed to 
make 14 shots.
Richards won the championship 
round and the shootout, putting 
in 19 of 25 shots. Orrill took sec
ond with 14, and Lee rounded out 
the winners, sinking 10 shots.
After the game, Richards said, 
Im glad to win something after 
our disappointing loss [in the 
majors championship game].
In the three on three basketball 
tournament, each basket was 
worth only one point and all games 
were played to 11 points.
The two night event continued 
into its last night with CIA-A going 
up against Marvins Gardeners. 
CIA took an early two point lead, 
but Marvins Gardeners Dave 
Simmons scored two of his six 
consecutive points to tie the game 
and to take the lead. Marvins

Carnegie Mellon freshman 
Brian Zimmerman converted his 
already strong and successful sea
son into All-American Honors at 
the NCAA Division III Champi
onships at Bowdoin College in 
Brunswick, Maine last weekend.
Zimmerman placed well'in all 
three days of competition. This 
CMU swimmer finished eighth in 
the.500 yd freestyle with a time of 
4:38.5. This set a new school rec
ord, and earned Zimmermaji AllAmerican honors in this event.
Zimmerman continued pulling 
in the honors on the second day of 
the meet. His time of 1:43.8 in the 
200 yd freestyle was good enough 
for a fourteenth place finish and 
an Honorable Mention All-American title.
With the superb record that 
Zimmerman carried during the 
championships, the Honorable 
All-American was not enough. His 
strongest finish in the meet was 
on the final day of the meet. Plac
ing fourth, Zimmerman set a new 
school record in 16:6.02 for the 
1650 yd freestyle, andeameJdhim 
a second All-American honor.
Brian was one of the best fresh
men at the meet, said Head oach 
Jim Perkins.
Teammate Greg Schooley also 
qualified for the championship 
meet for the second time tn his 
career. Schooleys performance 
this year may not have rivaled 
newcomer Zimmermans, but he 
made a strong showing in the 
meet. Schooley placed 26th with 
a time of 1:56.9 in the 20 yd 
butterfly, and took 30th in the 
100 yd butterfly in 53.7 seconds.
The meet was a great culmina
tion to a terrific season for both 
the mens and womens teams, 
commented Perkins.
game, 11-9.
Immediately following their 
victory over CIA, Marvins ;Gardeners faced Beta/Pez Dispenser. 
Beta had a 2-1 lead when Betas 
Bill Cramer hit four consecutive 
baskets. Beta had a five point 
lead before Marvins Gardeners 
were able to score.
Thanks to Cramers eightbas
kets, Beta held onto the lead and 
beat Marvins Gardeners, 11-8.
Beta advanced to the champi
onship game and won the Minors 
division, defeating Ben Wa Balls.
In the Majors division, Show
boat took the championship, beat
ing World-B-Beta.
Foul shooting champions were 
also determined last Thri^sday 
night. Orrill hit 89 of 100 Shots 
from the foul line. Second place 
went to Seth Herz with 87! bas
kets. Tied for third with 86 bas
kets apiece were Jay Kulyk and 
Marty Stovar.

'.The second in a series previewing'this seasons baseball teams. 
TIiis week, the American League 
W) West.r> o.i
Oakland Athletics: The big
gest story of last season was the 
emergence of outfielder Jos 
Canseco as a legitimate star. How
ever, the real strength of the As 
lies in their pitching staff, one of 
the.best in baseball. The starting 
rotation, led by 20 game winner 
Efave Stewart, is so deep that Rick 
Honeycutt and Eric Plunk, both 
quality pitchers, ended up in the 
bulpen. Of course, the bullpen 
als contains Dennis Eckersley, 
,>vho went from mediocre Cubs 
starter to one of the best relievers 
in the game.
The infield is solid at the cor
ners, with Mark McGwire at first 
and Carney Lansford at third, 
but the middle is a bit shaky. 
Shortstop Walt Weiss came on 
late in the year, but the trio of 
Mike Gallego, Glenn Hubbard, 
and Tony Phillips at second needs 
help (Hubbards .255 was the 
highest average of the three).
The outfield is good with 
Canseco in right and comeback 
player Dave Henderson, but left 
fielder Luis Polonia has trouble 
hitting lefthanded pitching. Stan 
Javier and Phillips may see time 
in defensive situations, and DH 
Dave Parker may also see action 
in the outfield.
Minnesota Twins: A few years 
ago, the Twins were in danger of 
being moved out of Minnesota. 
Now they have a world champi
onship under their belts and have 
an outside shot at the AL West 
this year. Unfortunately, their 
pitching isnt as deep as the As. 
Frank Viola, Allan Anderson, and
Shane Rawley give the Twins good 
lefthanded starters, but the right 
side is weak. The bullpen is led by 
Jeff Reardon, but the rest of the 
relievers arent dependable 
enough to win the title.
The Twins strength lies in their 
hitting. Catcher Tim Laudner, 
first baseman Kent Hrbek, and 
third baseman Gary Gaetti give 
the Twins three power hitters in 
the infield alone. Wally Backmart, 
acquired from the Mets, should 
fit in the second spot in the bat
ting order and play solid defense.
In the outfield, the Twins have 
Kirby Puckett, Dan Gladden, and 
a small army of people in right 
field, trying to replace Tom Brunansky. Puckett is one of the best 
right handed hitters, proven by 
his .356 average  best by an AL 
right hander since Joe DiMaggio 
hit .357 in 1941. Gladden is a 
dependable leadoff hitter, but not 
outstanding. Randy Bush and 
speedster John Moses will com
pete for right field. Switch hitter 
Gene Larkin will probably be the 
designated hitter (DH) when the 
season starts.
Texas Rangers: The starting 
pitching on the Rangers has the 
potential to be the best in the 
division. Nolan Ryan has to 
weather the transition to the 
American League, Bobby Witt has 
to learn to find the plate, and 
Jamie Moyer, acquired from the 
Cubs, has to come through with 
some wins. The bullpen has no 
real standouts, although Jeff 
Russell did make the All-Star 
team last season. Catching is 
going to be the responsibility of 
rookie Chad Kreuter, a switch 
hitter who hit .275 in a brief trial 
with Texas last season.
The infield was helped by the 
trades for second baseman Julio 
Franco from the Indians and first 
baseman Rafael Palmeiro, an out
fielder from the Cubs. Scott 
Fletcher and Steve Buechele hold 
down the left side of the infield, 
but neither is All-Star material.
The outfield is anchored by 
power hitter Pete Incaviglia in 
left field and Ruben Sierra, the 
next Roberto Clemente, in right. 
Incaviglia is a defensive liability, 
but Sierra and center fielder Cecil 
Espy are both excellent fielders. 
Unfortunately, the Rangers have 
no real backups in the outfield. 
Houston third baseman Buddy 
Bell and backup catcher Geno 
Petralli will attempt to improve 
upon the Rangers dismal desig
nated hitting performance of last 
year (a combined. 197 average for 
the DH).
Kansas City Royals: How can 
you like a team that traded David 
Cone and Danny Jackson for Ed 
Hearn, Rick Anderson, Ted 
Power, and Kurt Stillwell? Actu
ally, the starting pitching isnt all 
that bad with the acquisition of 
Floyd Bannister and rookie Tom 
(Flash) Gordon, and the return to 
form of Mark Gubicza and Bret 
Saberhagen. However, the bull
pen needs help, and this year will 
only make Royals fans miss the 
glory days of Dan Quisenberry 
more. Steve Farr is the only qual
ity pitcher, unless Gordon gets 
work as the long reliever.
The infield shows a nice, clean 
generation gap. The right side 
contains George Brett and Frank 
White, remnants of the pennant 
years. The left side is comprised 
of youngsters Kurt Stillwell at 
shortstop and Kevin Seitzer at 
third. While Seitzer and Brett are 
still star players, Whites perform
ance has steadily declined, and 
Stillwell is labeled as having po
tential, which means hes not 
very good now, but he may be
someday.
The outfield is one of the best in 
the division. Bo Jackson could be 
one of baseballs best if he could 
learn to swing with more disci
pline. Willie Wilson will play 
center again, but he knows he is 
keeping the seat warm for Gary 
Thurman, who should make the 
roster this year. Right fielder 
Danny Tartabull has used the 
last two years to show people what 
he could do if he made it out of 
Seattle. Now hes a full-fledged 
star. The designated hitter role 
should belong to clutch hitter Pat 
Tabler, but Jim Eisenreich and 
Bill Buckner should also get some 
at-bats.
California Angels: Once upon 
a time, the Angels were one of the 
oldest teams in baseball, starting 
such players as Bobby Grich, Rod 
Carew, Doug DeCinces, and Tony 
Armas. In the last couple of years, 
however, a youth movement has 
hit the Angels that may someday 
give them a few division titles. 
Not this year, though.
The biggest sign of the Angels 
youth is in the pitching staff. With 
the exception of reliever Jack 
Lazorko and starters Dan Petry 
and Bert Blyleven, the Angels 
dont have a pitcher over 30. 
Unforunately, the veterans who 
are there cant cover for the young
sters, so the Angels will have a lot 
of trouble this year. Besides that, 
they dont have a dominant closer 
in the bullpen. Phillies washout 
Lance Parrish will get one more 
chance as catcher since Bob Boone 
defected to Kansas City.
The infield, like the rest of the 
team, could be good someday. 
Wally Joyner has already made it 
to star status, but the rest of the 
infield is lagging behind. Second 
baseman Johnny Ray got his job 
back by virtue of the fact that he 
is horrible in the outfield. Dick
Schofield is a good defensema 
but has trouble hitting, and thii 
baseman Jack Howell is 
inexperienced.
The outfield is the one plat 
where the Angels have solid ve 
erans playing. Right fielder Chi 
Davis is a great offensive threa 
but his defense leaves somethin 
to be desired (19 errors  a clu 
record). Devon White is esser 
tially the same as Gary Petti: 
who was dealt to make room; 
White. Claudell Washington, 
grab from the Yankees, shou] 
platoon with Tony Armas in left 
38-year-old Brian Downin 
should still have a season or tw 
left in him at DH.
Seattle Mariners: The staij 
ing pitchers on this team are Mai 
Langston and Scott Bankheat 
the others are really immaterial 
There are a few Triple-A pro: 
pects who will get a chance, bu 
dont expect much. The bullpei 
however, looks pretty good. Mil 
Jackson and Mike Schooler bot 
turned in good years taking the! 
youth into account, and the 
tion of Oriole stopper Tom Nis 
denfuer makes the short relit 
look good. The problem lies in tfi 
middle and long relief, much lit 
the Cleveland Indians.
The infield is not good or 
just average. First baseman Alvi 
Davis never really measured 
to the teams expectations of hin 
Second baseman Harold Reynold 
is one of the best in the leagm 
and hes finally started to hit fo 
average. Shortstop Rey Quinoni 
is possible trade bait, due mostl 
to his poor defense, and third baa 
man Jim Presley has slowly d| 
generated into mediocrity.
The outfield has good youfl 
talent. Mickey Brantley and J; 
Buhner should be starters, an

\The third in a series previewing 
\this seasons baseball teams. This 
\week, the National League (NL) 
JEast.
New York Mets: It would be 
nice to imagine a truly competi
tive season in the NL East this 
year, but it just isnt going to 
happen. The Mets will win the 
division, quite simply, because 
they have^ihe best pitching staff 
in^iatfs^i^c Dwight Gooden, 
David Cone'i^id Fernandez, Bob 
Ojedaiiin^Ron Darling make up 
the b^tlstarting rotation, and 
this is just the tip of the iceberg. 
Randy Myers is one of the best 
young relievers in the game, and 
Roger McDowell isnt exactly a 
pushover.
I could go on about the Mets 
pitching, but the position players 
are just as important. Catcher 
Gary Carter and first baseman 
Keith Hernandez are coming 
toward the ends of their careers, 
which is going to leave the Mets 
with a big gap to fill. In fact, look 
for Mackey Sasser and Dave 
Magadan seeing a lot of time as 
they are groomed for succession.
The rest of the infield is an 
interesting story. Second base
man Tim Teufel finally has the 
job to himself, but many people 
feel that the Mets dealt the wrong 
half of the Backman/Teufel tan
dem. Shortstop and third base 
will be picked from the trio of 
Howard Johnson, Kevin Elster, 
and rookie phenom Gregg Jef
fries. Johnsons name has been in 
a lot of trade talks recently, but 
dont count him out yet. Also, 
fcxpect Keith Miller to get a shot 
kt second base.
Theoutfield is probably the best 
in baseball. Darryl Strawberry, 
attitude problems aside, has MVP 
ability', .as does left fielder Kevin 
jVlcReynolds, who has finally 
realized the potential that caused 
the Padres to draft him originally. 
Mookie Wilson is a great leadoff 
hitter and should get the starting 
job on the strength of his second 
half of last season. If not, Lenny 
Dykstra will also make a fine
center fielder.
Pittsburgh Pirates: Being 
from Pittsburgh, I think the Pi
rates have made remarkable 
progress since 1986, but they still 
have a long way to go.
First of all, the Bucs are weak 
in lefthanded pitching; John 
Smiley is the only quality lefty on 
the staff. The Bucs have picked 
up a few lefthanders, but no one 
of real value. The righthanders 
make up for the lack of lefthan
ders. Jim Gott and Mike Dunne, 
both throw-in pitchers on deals, 
are playing major roles, and the 
success of Doug Drabek and Brian 
Fisher is probably giving George 
Steinbrenner fits right now.
The infield is tough to call this 
season. Second baseman Jose 
Lind is a superb fielder, but is 
going to be recovering from arm 
surgery during the off-season. 
Bobby Bonilla is a question mark 
because I cant be sure which half 
of the season was the real Bonilla. 
First base and shortstop have 
starters in Sid Bream and Rafael 
Belliard, but the Bucs will have to 
do better if they want to win a
pennant.
Barry Bonds, Andy Van Slyke, 
and Glenn Wilson form the best 
defensive outfield in the league. 
Bonds seems to be better suited to 
a lower spot in the order, but the 
Pirates need a leadoff man. Van 
Slyke would be the best overall 
outfielder in baseball if he could 
just hit lefthanded pitching. 
Wilson may be getting over the 
hill, but I believe that he can still 
produce. R.J. Reynolds should get 
a lot of time as the fourth out
fielder.
St. Louis Cardinals: The
Cards pitchers have got a long 
road ahead of them. John Tudor 
is gone, and Danny Cox is out for 
the season, depriving them of their 
top two hurlers. Joe Magrane and 
Jose DeLeon will be called on to 
make up the gap, a job that, at 
least Magrane is qualified for. 
The rest of the starting staff will 
be made up of rookies. In the 
bullpen, it will be things as usual: 
Todd Worrell and Ken Dayley 
closing, and anyone available in 
between.
The infield could be in good
shape if third baseman Terry 
Pendleton can recover from an 
Astroturf knee injury. Pedro 
Guerrero should be a star at first 
base, and Ozzie Smith should hit 
well this year, even though his 
glove is what earns his dough. 
The big question is whether Jose 
Oquendo can hold the second base 
job for the entire year.
The outfield of the Cardinals is 
certainly as good as any in the 
league. Right fielder Tom Brunansky provides the home run 
power, and Vince Coleman, Wil
lie McGee, and Milt Thompson 
will provide a lot of speed on the 
base paths.
Montreal Expos: Until pitch
ing ace Pascual Perez went into 
drug rehab, I had the Expos picked 
for third. The rest of the staff is 
average, although Kevin Gross 
had a great first half last year, 
and rookie Randy Johnson showed 
promise of great things to come. 
The bullpen-by-committee system 
should get the Expos through 
another season, though it 
wouldnt be too surprising to see 
Tim Burke take over as the regu
lar stopper.
The infield boasts one of the 
best young stars of the game in 
first baseman Andres Galarraga. 
Unfortunately, the rest of the 
infield is in transition. Tom Foley, 
Johnny Paredes, Rex Hudler, and 
newly acquired Spike Owen all 
have good shots at the two middle 
infield slots; in fact, the Expos 
may go to a platoon system. Third 
baseman Tim Wallach came down 
hard after a great 87 season, but 
he should rebound this year.
Tim Raines, the Expos best 
outfielder and former leadoff hit
ter, will probably move down in 
the order to make room for center 
fielder Otis Nixon in the top spot. 
Nixon has blazing speed, stealing 
46 bases in only 90 games, but is 
a rather weak hitter. Right fielder 
Hubie Brooks is never going to be 
listed with the great outfielders 
of baseball, but he does put up 
consistently good numbers, espe
cially in runs batted in.
Chicago Cubs: The problem 
with being a Cubs pitcher is play
ing half the season in Wrigley 
Field, where the wind turns easy
fly balls into home runs. Hoi 
ever, many of the Cubs pitchei 
would be awful in other parks 
well. Rick Sutcliffe is the on 
proven star; the rest of the staff 
less than fantastic. Rich Gossaj 
no longer has the velocity tli 
made him such a great pitcheri 
the 70s and early 80s, and tl 
rest of the bullpen isnt any be 
ter. One bright spot in the Cul 
staff is rookie Mike Harkey, a 9 
plus thrower who already has 
virtual lock on a starting job.
First baseman Mark Grai 
needs to hit for more power, but 
otherwise solid. Ryne Sandbe 
and Shawon Dunston are bo: 
proven stars in the middle of tl 
infield, even if Dunston striki 
out too often and doesnt hit wi 
enough yet. The serious concei 
is the possibility that third bas 
man Vance Laws .293 year w 
only a fluke and that they do: 
have a good backup if he flops tl 
year.
What could the Cubs manae 
ment have been thinking whi 
the decision was made to si

The big deal of the off-season was 
the signing of Jeffrey Leonard. If 
Leonard can do well, it will take 
some of the heat of the rest of the 
lineup, especially Presley. Steve

fielding, low average, but a lot of 
power.

son. At least the experience of 
catcher Carlton Fisk will serve to 
educate the young pitchers, as 
well as put a big bat in the lineup.
Ozzie Guillen is one of the best 
defensive shortstops in baseball;
however, hes only an average hit
ter. First baseman Greg Walker 
will try to come back from a sei
zure suffered last season, bijt exPirate Mike Diaz will be waiting 
if needed. Second and third bases 
are a joke though; Fred Maririque, a career backup, starts1 at 
second, and college prospect Robin 
Ventura will probably bypass the 
minor leagues to play third base.
Kenny Williams is a good young 
prospect who could blossom, now 
that the Sox have abandoned their 
ill-fated third base experiment 
with Williams. The rest of the 
outfield is rather weak; the'two 
remaining positions will be picked 
from about five players, but Ivan 
Calderon and Harold Baines are 
the early favorites. Ron Kittle will 
start in the designated hitters 
slot, but the outfield backups will 
probably all see time.
many chances to shine if the start
ers and middle relief cant give 
them any leads.
The infield is also going to be a 
problem this year. Von Hayes is 
getting moved to the outfield so 
that Ricky Jordan will get a 
chance to play every day, and 
thats the good news. Second 
baseman Tommy Herr is going to 
have to overcome the pressures of 
changing leagues in two consecu
tive years. Shortstop Steve Jeltz 
is the worst everyday shortstop in 
baseball, and third baseman Mike 
Schmidt is beginning to show his 
age on the field.
The Phillies outfield is filled 
with converted infielders. First 
baseman Von Hayes is moving 
back to his old position of left 
field, second baseman Juan 
Samuel is moving to center to 
make room for Tommy Herr, and 
Chris James is returning to the , 
outfield after a failed attempt at 
third base.
How to get through college with money to spare:
1. Buy a Macintosh.
-n
2. Add a peripheral.
3. Get a nice, fat check.

Stress is the response a 
person experiences as a reaction 
to a difficult situation, said 
Carnegie Mellon Counseling 
and Student Development 
Center senior staff member 
Glen Sherman. He added,
What a particular person finds 
difficult varies among individu
als. Generally, a situation in 
which the person feels pressure 
or feels put out by something 
will produce stress.
At Carnegie Mellon, stress en
ters into almost every minute of 
every day, and, of course, a cer
tain amount of stress helps a 
student to maintain a good level 
of alertness and helps him to 
function well within his daily 
routine, but how much stress is 
too much? How can a person 
recognize stress in his/her own 
life? And what can he/she do to 
lower uncomfortable levels of 
stress? '
The key seems to lie in the 
students awareness of himself/ 
herself and his/her personal 
limits. Learning to recognize 
the symptoms of stress can help 
a person break away from stress 
before it taxes both body and 
mind to their limits.
Most people can recite at least 
some of the symptoms of stress 
from memory. Sherman de
scribed muscle tension,... 
tightness in the shoulders, 
frequent headaches, an in
creased heart rate, sweaty 
palms, and changes in mood,... 
whether it is toward increased 
sensitivity in certain situations, 
being irritable, for example, 
feeling more quickly angered, or 
being impatient with other 
people in situations where [one] 
might have been better able to 
cope before.
Also, changes in energy 
level; for instance, less 
energy and either increased 
or decreased hours of sleep 
at night. Other symptoms 
include a dry mouth, dilated 
pupils, bad dreams, and 
sometimes even difficulty in 
breathing
These stress symptoms 
serve a practical purpose in 
the physiology of the human 
being. In mans early history, 
he needed to prepare in
stantly to either fight off a 
fierce beast or run away run 
away from it. In todays 
culture, corporate pressure 
and interpersonal difficulties 
have usurped the fierce 
beasts, but mans reactions 
remain constant  except 
that there are often no clearcut releases from the types of 
tension in modern life. Thus, 
ja person carries around con
stantly-increasing levels of 
stress for extended periods of 
time. The biological ramificaJtih dkt 0ocC Bie
tions look dim.
The undisputed champion in 
stress retention is the Type A 
personality. Type A embodies 
many of the values of a quickmoving, work-centered society 
like ours.
Type A thrives on competi
tion; he or she is aggressive, 
ambitious, and often impatient 
with those around him or her. 
He or she attacks all challenges 
head on, speaks and lives 
quickly, and thereby imposes 
upon his or her body the ten
sions and anxieties associated 
with this ambitiouslifestyle.
The bad news is that all of the 
stress Type A builds up in his or 
her body can lead to serious ill
ness. Researchers suggest that
high levels of stress gathered 
over time correlate strongly 
with heart problems, because of 
the stress-accompanied increase 
in heart rate. Also associated 
with high stress level are shest 
and back pains, headaches, ul
cers, and diabetes, which has to 
do with the increase in blood 
sugar levels accompanied by 
increased kindey activity.
What can a person do, then, 
when he or she suspects that 
excessive stress is seeping into 
his or her life? According to 
Sherman,  the first thing is to 
develop an increased capacity to 
recognize when youre being af
fected. To notice when you feel 
tension. To notice when youre

Students can beat the stress cycle
computer screen too long you 
just got to get up and take a 
break. A friend of Lees added 
that he liked to read when he 
wearied of the keyboard. Other 
computer users choose to play 
computer games to unwind. 
However, this opens the danger 
of playing the game for hours 
instead of working.
High levels of stress arent 
limited to those on computers, 
of course. According to Creative 
Writing major Brent Stevens, 
English can be just as stressful 
as any other major. Writing a 
story in the library at 2:30am 
about some guy whos losing his 
marbles can be pretty hard on 
your own, said Stevens. If Im 
really trucking away on a story 
I cant stop. If I do it will be on 
my mind for hours bugging me.
I wont even be able to get to 
sleep. Under these conditions 
study breaks can be expensive if 
they break the writers line of 
thought. If Ive been writing 
like a bastard for hours Im 
usually mentally drained. I try 
to get outside and walk around, 
or Ill go eat. Breaks are impor
tant to give your brain a chance 
to recharge and generate new 
ideas.
In general, getting away from 
your workload, even for just a 
little while every day, can make 
a student more productive. 
Without the pressure of feeling 
like he or she must produce 
something, ideas for the things 
that need to get done might 
suddenly appear as if out of 
nowhere.

Stress. What do you do when 
youve had enough and just 
cant take it anymore? Accord
ing to Donna Morosky, Director 
of Health Education, you should 
get some exercise. Exercise 
releases the endomorphines

 How many people have taken 
notice of the absence of the IT in 
the Carnegie Mellon University 
sign overlooking Forbes Avenue?
The letter disappeared over a 
year ago; it will make its reap
pearance before the end of the 
week, thanks to the efforts of stu
dent Erick Naka-Mizrahi, who 
found it shocking that no one 
noticed that the U was gone.
The campaign to regain the 
missing letter started as a joke 
when Johnny Feet, NakaMizrahis roommate, said offhand
edly that he found it disturbing 
that the IT had been missing for 
over one-and-a-half semesters.
Before this time, Naka-Mizrahi 
never considered heading the 
quest for the return of the missipg letter, but he decided that it 
was worth a try.
! Naka-Mizrahi brought up the 
missing U at a Student Dormi
tory Council meeting about a 
month ago. At approximately the 
same time, he also talked to the

Naka-Mizrahi expected no re

so he was quite surprised when 
someone annonymously mailed 
him the U through the campus 
mail.
Naka-Mizrahi notified physical

Presenting the fashionable students guide to 
the ins and outs of the year in campus life
IN
The snack of spring is Chil
ean Fruit.
Grapes and apples delicately 
laced with cyanide encourage 
the consumer to relax at the 
dinner table. They also serve 
as a reminder to all of us of the 
elegance of moderation.
Long believed to be the es
sential message of the 80s, 
moderation is an ethic that 
could be here to stay. Espe
cially with the continuing ex
portation of Chilean fruit to 
the United States.
The look of spring for men is 
called Calves A La
Sweatpant.
Those forerunners of fashion 
who adjust the cuff of the 
sweatpant to a position just be
low the knee know what chic 
means. Akin to the rising hem
line of the miniskirt, this state
ment bares the leg between sock 
and knee to all the world.
For dressy occasions, a black 
tube sock or sneaker is recom
mended. It is also wise to remem
ber that this adjusted pant leg 
can be worn in lieu of Bermuda 
shorts, should the occasion so de
mand.
The place to be is Grey Matter.
A person can go there to watch 
jugglers, get in on a rousing game 
of Dungeons and Dragons, or just 
watch the same video game over 
and over again at the Skibo Infor
mation Desk. The well-informed 
patron can also take advantage of 
the Ice Water Exchange.
This event takes place during 
the lunch hours and involves a 
trade between students and the 
administration. If you offer a 
Great Idea, to the administra
tive representative on hand you
will receive a glass of ice water 
and a University Dining Service 
cookie. Truly a pleasant way to 
while away the hours.

The out recreational toy is the 
semi-automatic rifle.
Recently banned by the Bush 
administration, this weapon is 
passe among those in the know. 
Once considered a party pick-meup with the Rambo set, today this 
rifle wouldnt even make a Con
tra Christmas list.
The out time is 8 am.
First semester, of course, it was 
quite chic to boast of seeing the 
dawns early eight o clock light. 
Now, nobody will admit to even 
knowing what that light is.
The official collegiate time to 
recognize is 1 pm, and anything 
afterwards. Not only is 1 pm a 
P.T.H (a Prime Tanning Hour), it 
is also an excellent part of the day 
in which to enjoy breakfast. Save
8 am for the upcoming yuppie 
years. It will undoubtably be put
to good use then.
The out drink falls under the 
category of any type of cooler.
Difficult to accompany with 
any cocktail snack, other than 
Cheetos, this drink is for the 
sewer. The colors do not reflect 
any type of flavor. Mauve, 
Taupe, and Battleship describe 
the subtle hues of most coolers, 
while their enticing titles open  
the door to disappointment. 
Wild Berry is perhaps the 
worst, being neither savage nor 
horticultural in any way., 
Passion Mango, Very 
Guava, et al come in as close 
second-to-worsts.
The out accessory is the nude 
stocking.
This goes for both men and 
women. The artificiality of the 
perfectly monochromatic leg is 
very unappealing. If you must, 
wear nude stockings, at least 
spill a bit of jelly or Chilean 
grape juice or some terrible fruit. 
cooler on the ankles and knees 
so that people assume you have 
a skin condition.

less patient with people or when 
youre irritable, and then begin to 
ask yourself whats going on. 
Sherman continued to say that 
the next step concerns isolating 
the causes of the stress. Some
times the source of a students 
stress is a lot easier to isolate 
than at other times.
As an example, Sherman cited 
the stress that many students ex
perience during midterms. He 
continued to say that, once a stu
dent recognizes that this is the 
source of his or her stress, he or 
she should then proceed to elimi
nate this specific stress by work
ing directly on the problem  
prioritizing all of the commit
ments on his or her time and 
developing better time manage
ment skills.
Sherman also suggested sev
eral more general methods for re
lieving overall levels of stress in 
the students life.
He pointed out that, even when 
people acknowledge that stress is 
. affecting them to a large degree, 
they forget that they should begin 
to do things differently; to relax. 
Furthermore, he explained that
If someone is constantly on the 
go, thats whats producing the 
stress. One way of reducing that 
stress is to stop the cycle  to get 
off the treadmill  even if it is 
only for a short period each day.
Oftentimes, people can then 
return to their work much better 
prepared to be productive.
Another part of that is, of 
course, to take good care of ones 
self on a regular basis: to eat 
properly, to sleep regularly; to 
faithfully attend to those basic 
needs because, of course, night 
after night of sleeplessness or not 
eating properly can take its toll 
and make a person stressed.
It remains for the student to 
decide on the activities, if any, he 
or she considers restful to round 
out his schedule.
Some students might argue that 
the demandingworkloadincurred 
every week at Carnegie Mellon 
University makes such hobbies 
impractical, but these individu
als might consider the fact that 
their overall productivity is bound 
to increase with only a minimal 
time commitment to an activity 
that they happen to enjoy.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  21 March 1989L3
Old rumors never die, they just get weirder
Carnegie Mellon University 
ever ceases to amaze me.
In this column I have insulted 
Imost every facet of the ad
ministration of this school, and 
tie response was never event 
oud enough to disrupt the night 
ife of a newt.
I openly blasted the lack of 
vision that has caused such vast 
managerial blunders as the canellation of the Beaux Arts Ball 
nd the Student Activities cener and the uproar that ensued 
was staggeringly minimal.
I even went as far as to sugest that Rin-Tin-Tin be nomi
nated for the post of President 
if the University, and the only 
esponse I received was a letter 
from the board of trustees askng Who is this Mr. Tin-Tin 
and is he available?
But heaven forbid that I hurl 
barb at Madonna! The next 
thing I know my pet bunny has 
'been murdered and boiled and 
acid is being dropped on the 
hood of my car!
All of the sudden everybody is 
lenjoying Pepsi Colas and sing
ling Like A Prayer, and Im a 
social leper! Ive even heard a 
vicious rumor that I have be
come the number one target on 
the hit list of the local Whos 
That Girl Fan Club.
Although I must admit to 
shudder in utter terror at the 
ght of a dozen Madonna 
Wanna-Bes attempting to 
throttle me with their boy-toy 
accoutrements, I must stress 
that Ive only heard this as a 
rumor; which, quite appropri
ately, is my topic for this week.
I must guiltily admit that 
the mechanics by which a ru
mor spreads in a civilized soci
ety is one of the things which 
interests me most.
As an illustration of how wide
spread rumor mongering is in 
our society, I would like to bring 
forth an example from my youth. 
As a fresh faced Jr. High
Schooler (actually, as a broken 
out, pimply faced, semi gawky Jr. 
High Schooler), I remember hear
ing a rumor about a well-known 
rock star (I wont stoop to naming 
names, but you all know him, he 
sang that song about infatuation 
... you know the one; he had the 
wacked out hair and twirled his 
microphone over his head. All 
right, Rod Stewart!) who col
lapsed onstage and was taken to 
a hospital where his stomach was 
pumped free of all three liters of 
... Im sorry, but journalistic in
tegrity prevents me from reveal
ing the name of that high-viscosity, protein laden substance at 
hand.
Over six years have passed since 
I heard this rumor, and yet, imag
ine my surprise when, three days 
ago, as the song My Heart Cant 
Tell Me No came started playing 
on the jukebox at the Tartan 
Grill, the person with whom I was 
eating burst forth with the re
mark Hey, guess what I heard 
about Rod Stewart!
I was stunned. The fact that 
someone here spent his Junior 
High School years over seven 
hundred miles away from the 
state of Michigan (where I spent 
my Junior High School years) but 
still managed to register the same 
vile drivel about Rod Stewarts 
sexual preference is downright 
amazing.
But Rod Stewart is not the only 
victim of the rumor cycle which 
surrounds our country with the 
dogged permanence of the Gulf 
Stream. Various people have re
lated to me the same story about 
both Elton John and David Bowie. 
Indeed, rumors have invaded 
every aspect of out everyday life, 
from the food that we eat to the 
personalities who entertain us 
and rule the land in which we 
live.
The lives of entertainers are a 
veritable gold mine for those who 
create and purvey the public at 
large with rumors. For example, 
if the rumor mill were to be be
lieved, every person in Hollywood 
has either been killed by a drug 
overdose, is the wearer of a glass 
eye, or was the star of porno
graphic movies before hitting it 
big.
Among the glass eye wearers 
are both Jack Lord and Sammy 
Davis, Jr. The drug overdose car
tel includes every child actor who 
has ever been in the business; 
from every one of the girls in The 
Brady Bunch, to the members of 
the Our Gang gang (with the 
possible exception of Spanky, 
rumor has it that Spanky grew 
up to become the popular seven
ties rock star Meat Loaf). Actu
ally, this brings me to an interest
ing convergence in the gossip 
cycle: apparently Susan Olsen, 
who played Cindy on The Brady 
Bunch (you remember her, she 
was The Youngest One In Curls) 
was both a pom star and died of a 
drug overdose. Whether she was 
a pom star before she hit it big 
with The Brady Bunch is still a 
hotly debated item.
Of course, there are many other 
show business myths. My favor
ite one is the legend of Walt 
Disney. Popular folklore has it 
that Walt was frozen in suspended 
animation until society finds a 
cure for his ailments. I am sure 
that this will come as a big sur
prise to the members of his family 
who had him cremated.
The vast expanse of Show-Biz 
scuttlebutt ranges from the mor
bid (Hey! I just heard that Bobby 
McFerrin committed suicide!) to 
the painfully obvious (Hey, I just 
heard that Morissey committed 
suicide!), from the unbelievable 
(Hey, I just heard that Christie 
Brinkley is a man!) to the really 
unbelievable (Hey, I just heard 
that Stallones next film will be a 
talkie!).
Food is perhaps one of the areas 
of our culture which is most often 
subject to the sharp dagger of 
salacious gossip. Indeed, very 
few of us have managed to go 
through our lives without hear
ing such delicious morsels as All 
McDonalds hamburgers have 
worms/horsemeat/insect excre
ment/fish scales/chicken genitals 
in them! Or how about the one 
that has persistently vexed Colo
nel Sanders many restaurants: 
A rat once got into the breading, 
was placed into fryers by accident 
and got served as a drumstick in 
a Kentucky Fried Chicken meal! 
I can only assume that the rats 
tail was erect at the time it was 
fried.
The candy industry has also 
seen its share of whoppers (par
don the pun). For example, the 
Mars Chocolate Company has 
benefitted intensely from the oft 
told story that green M&Ms in
crease sexual prowess. Hopefully, 
this story has regained the com
pany all of those consumers it lost 
as a result of the fable that red 
M&Ms cause cancer. Still, the 
most maligned candy item has 
got to be Pop-Rocks. PopRocks, for those of you who dont 
remember, were those mineral
like bits which would interact with 
saliva in order to create a wonder
fully refreshing tingling sensa
tion somewhat akin to being 
hooked up to a low powered elec
tric generator. Apparently, ru
mour had it that he who ate PopRocks while drinking Pepsi Cola 
(or any other carbonated bever
age) would be subject to instanta
neous death. Apparently the 
combined release of both the PopRocks and the carbonated dis
charge of the carbonated bever
age are enough to cause atomic 
fission (or is it fusion?) causing 
almost instantaneous death to the 
person who has consumed the 
dastardly concoction. I have also 
been told that if you go swimming 
righfrafter eating Pop-Rocks the 
results are equally deadly.
The person most often victim
ized by our countrys penchant for 
rumor mongering is someone who 
has been connected with both 
media stardom and food. I am 
speaking, of course, about 
Mikey. We all remember 
Mikey, the kid in the old Life 
cereal commercials. Ever since 
the Life cereal commercials went 
off the air, the subject Mikeys 
fate has been shrouded in the sort 
of contradiction and that has 
become a legend in the world of 
rumors. Indeed we have all heard 
it said that Mikey died of a 
heroin overdose in the early nine
teen-seventies. Is this the truth 
about the death of Mikey? Not 
according to other factions who 
claim that Mikey was indeed 
killed in the last years of the VitNam war. Can this be true? Well, 
along the fringes of the rumor 
mill there are those who believe 
that Mikey was actually killed 
while trying to eat Pop-Rocks 
while drinking Pepsi Cola. Per
sonally, I am a believer in that 
Mikey died in a heroin den, 
during the last few days of the 
Viet-Nam war while eating PopRocks. Thus far, I am the only 
person I know who believes in 
this.
There is another area of rumor 
mongering which has offered us a 
great deal of amusement in the 
past, I am referring to unex
plained natural phenomena. How 
many of us can forget overhear
ing such potentially alarming 
information as Eating the seeds 
of fruit will cause trees to grow in 
your stomach! or In the year 
2000 California will sink into the 
ocean! There are many other 
areas of unexplained natural 
phenomena, some of which have
enjoyed brief heydays and otherg 
which have become the hardy 
perennials of the tale spinners 
glossary. Among the hardy per
ennials are the mysterious disap
pearances of airplanes and ships 
in the Bermuda Triangle. Some^ 
blame flying saucers for the 
mysterious disappearances, oth
ers blame the Soviets, for others, 
myself included, the answer is, of 
course, Elvis. The list of short-' 
lived unnatural phenomena is" 
considerably longer, it includes" 
such mysteries as the Tunguska 
Blast of 1908 (Was it a comet? A 
hurtling bolt of antimatter? E1-* 
vis?) and, of course, the Harmonic' 
Convergence, where millions of 
people expected something great 
to happen because all of the plan-r 
ets came together in a line. Actu
ally, they didnt quite come to^1 
gether in a line, they were several 
million miles away from each" 
other, but hey, whats a few mil': 
lion miles between planets? 1,1 
For those whose age or superior11 
education prevents them from 
believing in unexplained natural 
phenomena, politics has become"

L4 The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  21 March 1989
Presidential speaker discusses the Chinese-American experience
By MARVIN GERMANY
Tartan Staffwriter
Maxine Hong-Kingston, au
thor of The Woman Warrior 
and the Pulitzer Prize 
nominated Chinamen, spoke 
in the Adamson Wing on Fri
day, March 17 about her writ
ings and about ChineseAmerican culture in general.
 Hong-Kingston is interested 
in a wide variety of topics. For 
example, she has written 
about the cultures which have 
been bom by poverty, and asks 
what type of creativity comes 
out of poverty. She also ex
plores cultural shock and the 
working class.
One of the things that inter
ests Hong-Kingston the most 
is movies. She is interested in 
how movies play a role in form
ing personality, how they 
function in the center of 
American culture, and the way 
that films can spread the idea 
of American culture. HongKingston went on to tell how 
her father had learned all of 
his manners from watching
old Fred Astaire movies.
Although both of the books she 
discussed in her lecture deal with 
the theme of the working class in 
action, she is also interested in 
what people do for fun.
She relateda story about when 
her grandfather used to go into 
Honolulu, and the way that some 
of her relatives smoked opium. 
She translates her fascination 
with how people spend their lei
sure time into her new book, Tripmaster Monkey, where she writes 
about a young man who is trying 
to figure out what to do with 
himself during the 1950s. He 
wants to entertain himself by 
hosting racially integrated par
ties, and by starting a private 
community similar to those 
formed by the beatniks and the 
hippies in the United States in 
the 1960s..
Hong-Kingston wanted to write 
a short, but powerful piece during 
the Vietnam War about two AsianAmerican brothers who were sent 
to Vietnam to fight other Asians. 
At that time, she hoped that this 
work would prove that the pen is 
mightier than the sword. HongKingston hoped that, in some way, 
her work would help put an end to 
the war. Unfortunately, she didnt 
finish the story until twenty years 
had passed. It took a long time to 
make sense of anything and it 
was a difficult topic [to write 
about], she told the audience.
Overall, Hong-Kingston desires 
to develop storylines that allow 
people to improvise their own 
stories on top of them, In the 
same way that Jazz artists im
provise on their songs. 
Although Hong-Kingston has 
faced much recent success, some 
of her books have been received 
poorly. A Sinologist for the New 
York Times complained that she 
didnt keep to the original Chi
nese myths, and that she had all 
the characters backwards.
But one of the reasons why she 
changed the myths was because 
the new myths that she createed 
apply to the situations here in 
America, while the old myths 
applied to a different situation in 
China. Besides, she adds, if you 
dont change a myth, it will grow 
old and die.
Hong-Kingston also spoke con
cerning writers block, and how 
she viewed writers block as a 
part of the whole writing proc
ess. Writing is a process that 
begins with experience...When 
we have writers block, we may 
not be putting our experiences 
down in words, but we are still 
writing because it is the stuff 
that will form our writings.
She believes that the hardest 
and most time-consuming part 
of writing is putting thoughts 
down on paper.
Hong-Kingston also discussed 
the Satanic Verses and free 
speech. Although she was wor
ried about the death threats 
against Verses author Salman 
Rushdie, what really shocked her 
was that most book stores were 
pulling the book off of shelves.Its 
a real shame, she said, because 
Rushdie is a really good writer. 
He has a really good imagination 
and he is very funny. I figured 
that most of the stores would fight 
to keep the book on the shelves a 
little longer than they did. 
Hong-Kingston just finished 
her third book, which she had 
worked on for the past eight years.

Villanova International, held at 
Villanova University on March 
pps
The team is in its second year 
and they have only been practic
ing trick drills for a month.
Team members devoted one full 
hour of each of these practices to 
standard drill, close-order march
ing, and rifle manual. The other 
half hour was spent on learning 
and practicing trick drill, an exer
cise new to most team members.
Drill tricks involve spinning, 
twirling, throwing, and exchang
ing rifles, not to mention some 
other, more complex marching 
manuevers. According to mem
bers of the ROTC team, these 
tricks also often involve cuts, 
bruises, and lacerations covering 
every inch of exposed skin on ones 
body.
With a mere six weeks left to 
establish their routine, the drill 
team members faced the challenge 
of learning the movements and 
also perfecting their timing and 
coordination without verbal com
mands.
Faced with the difficulty of this 
task, the drill team members
pushed themselves -to the limits 
to ready themselves for the Villa
nova meet on March 11.
Upon arriving at Villanova, the 
team rose to a new level of compe
tition. Nearly twenty schools 
participated, including the Uni
versity of Illinois, Penn State, and 
the United States Merchant 
Marine Academy; many of which 
have maintained active drill 
teams for years. Illinois squad 
had practiced twice a day since 
their Northwestern defeat at the 
hands of Carnegie Mellon.
The judges rate the teams on 
the execution, the timing and 
accuracy, and the synchronicity 
of the movements.
Despite heated competition, 
including a team that had its 
members executing while walk
ing up a flight of stairs, the Car
negie Mellon team placed re
spectably. The platoon finished 
in sixth place, while the unde
feated squad slipped to eleventh 
place and the trick team, in their 
first competition, finished in sixth 
place.
Although the team brought 
home no trophies, Carnegie Mel
lon ROTC has now made itself 
known as a competent presence 
in the area of drill competition.
The drill team will perform at 
Spring Carnival, according to drill 
team commander, midshipman 
4/C Serge Sherman.
The sixteen member drill team 
will return next year to face new 
meet with the confluence they 
have gained through their expe
riences of this season fresh in 
mind.

CMUs Navy ROTC drill team, despite the short amount of time they 
have been in existence, have produced quality performances in all of 
their meets, especially in the most recent meet, which was held at 
Villanova University. The platoon finished sixth despite facing off 
against teams with much more experience.

Who gave you the advice that 
changed your life? Who is the 
one person to whom saying I 
owe you one would be the ulti
mate understatement?
I recently asked these ques
tions of my readers to kick off 
my second I Owe You One 
contest. In the hundreds of 
touching letters I received, 
readers nominated a variety of 
people for this award, includ
ing spouses, parents, friends, 
strangers, celebrities  even 
God.
Raymond Witham nomi
nated his Zen master. Steve 
Davis nominated the director 
of his retarded citizens group. 
And Edythe Smith nominated 
her pastor for his understand
ing in welcoming her dying
mother into the church, even 
though her mother hadnt set foot 
inside of a church for over fifty 
years.
Sherry, a woman who was once 
homeless, wrote to me about the 
friend who once gave her advice, 
encouragement, food, and shel
ter.
Carmen nominated her coun
selor from her substance abuse 
center.
And then there was Roberta, a 
woman who lost her parents at 
the tender age of two and was 
forced to live with an uncle who 
sexually abused her.
Roberta nominated her older 
sister, who, in her words, 
snatched me off the street one 
day when I was twelve.
The older sister, just seventeen 
at the time of Robertas abduc
tion, fought for and ended up 
winning the custody battle for 
her sister Roberta.
As a child, I never appreciated 
what shed done for me, Roberta 
wrote. I resented her as a parent 
figure because she was just five 
years older than me.
Now Im 46 and Ive gone 
through the dreaded teenage 
years with my own two daugh
ters. I marvel that my sister, at 
that tender age, had the courage 
and guts to raise me. I always 
remember my sister on Mothers 
Day; shes the mother I never 
had. I have also wondered many 
times: Had it not been for my sis
ter, would I have lived long enough 
to be a mother myself?
Some of the entrants told sto
ries that were somewhat less dra
matic than Robertas, but still 
communicated a sweetness that 
I think is worth sharing.
Claire Metzger nominated au
thor Studs Terkel  a man who 
has made a career of speaking up 
for those whose lives have taken a 
bump or two.
Claire had just been fired from 
her secretarial job and, in tears, 
was walking across a bridge over 
the Chicago River. She happened 
to meet Studs.
Why the tears, kid? he asked 
her. She told him what had hap
pened to her, and he responded, 
Do you like the theater? Claire
nodded her head.
I cant give you a job, he told 
her, but Ill leave a couple of tick
ets for a show Im in at the 
Goodman. Bring a friend, have a 
laugh or two, and things will 
brighten up. Youll see.
This incident took place about 
thirty years ago, and things did 
finally work out for Claire. Her 
brief encounter with Studs gave 
her a new motto: No matter how 
bad life seems, theres always the 
theater.
Ever since, she has passed 
Studs advice  and a free thea
ter ticket or two if she can  to 
others who are facing a low blow 
in life.
Perhaps the most touching 
entries nominated people who are 
no longer around to accept the I 
Owe You One award.
Debra Gaborik cited Suzanne 
Boyd. The women met at age 
eleven and were inseparable 
friends from that time. Suzanne 
taught me how to believe in my
self, Debra wrote.
Suzanne died last year after an 
auto accident. She was twentyfive.
Wed planned to start a busi
ness together, Debra wrote. 
Well never do that. Well never 
take that vacation or watch each 
others children grow up. She 
cannot be the maid of honor at my 
wedding. I just pray that she 
knows how much I loved her and 
valued her friendship. I will con
tinue to draw upon her strength.
The winning entry came from 
an AIDS patient. He nominated 
his cousin for the loving care shes 
given him, and for helping him 
realize that I do have quite a bit 
to be thankful for. His cousin, he 
wrote, is the most giving person 
I have ever met. After reading 
his entry, I agreed that she is a 
remarkable woman. An award 
plaque has been prepared in her 
honor.
Dear Zazz,
I am about to enter into a 
marriage with a man I dont really 
love. He treats me very well, will 
support me in style, and has plans
to adopt my two-year-old son.
He knows I dont love him, 
but insists that my love for him 
can and will grow. Naturally, I 
have some reservations about 
this marriage.
I suspect, Zazz, that you will 
advise me to cancel the wed
ding. Or will you?
Almost at the Altar
Dear Almost,
Anytime someone is unsure 
about a relationship, the best 
advice I could give is to hold off 
on the marriage.
Sure, it is possible that in 
time your love for this man will 
grow.
But it can grow just as easily 
before your marriage as it can 
after it.
But until you feel more cer
tain, you are not being fair to 
either him or yourself or your 
child in going through with this 
wedding.
Send your questions for Jef
frey Zaslow to All That Zazz, 
Box 3455, Chicago, 1L 60654
Rumors have 
ncredible 
lasting power
continued from page L3
the primary source of amusement. 
George Bushs administration has 
provided one truly outstanding 
rumor. I know that I am not alone 
in the belief that the Secret Serv
ice has a secret mandate to shoot 
Dan Quayle should any harm 
come to President Bush. One can 
only hope that the Bush Admini
stration will provide us as many 
rumors as have the many admini
strations which have come before 
it (Nixon is a cross-dresser! 
Gerald Ford is going to Pardon 
Nixon! Gerald Ford is going to 
pardon Nixon for Cross-Dress
ing!). However, the most inter
esting political rumor I have ever 
heard involves an unexplained 
natural phenomena as well. 
Apparently, once California sinks 
into the Pacific it will declare it
self as an independent nation. 
One can only hope.
In the end, the last recourse of 
the idle listener is to take what 
we hear at face value yet believe 
nothing. If Elvis is truly at the 
heart of the Harmonic Conver
gence, or Richard Nixon has cho
sen to practice cross-dressing at 
the Bermuda Triangle, is it truly 
any of our business to know? 
perhaps the world operates in a 
'much more complex way than that 
which we believe is correct; per
haps all of the rumors are right. 
In any event, I will continue to eat 
Pop-Rocks and green M&Ms 
while watching reruns of the 
Brady Bunch, always in the 
blissful ignorance that can only 
come with the knowledge that 
perhaps life is just a little bit 
more complicated that I am will
ing to admit.

Alcohol Marker High, Or Why I 
Want To Transfer To Art School!

That! The Official Dont Worry

L6The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  21 March 1989
Carnival committee prepares to unveil a new and improved Spring Carnival
By TERENCE SPIES
Tartan Staffwriter
According to David Levy, the 
1989 Spring Carnival chairman, 
Hhis years Spring Carnival will
* be new and improved, featuring
 more bands, many more events,
' and an entirely different layout 
; all contributing to the overall effect.
I Perhaps the most evident 
-changes are those necessitated 
by the on-going construction in 
the area formally occupied by the 
^Midway. The traditional Carni
val rides will be divided between 
ithe Skibo and Warner Hall park^ing lots, with the kiddie rides 
located in the Warner Hall lot.
The Midway will be located in 
the Skibo parking lot. The Mid
way will also undergo other 
^changes in that it will be organ
ized in two parallel rows rather 
'than one long one.
; The 31 organizational booths 
the Midway are all in keeping 
with this years theme, Toyland. 
Some of the booths that will be 
seen on the Midway include 
Operation, Legos, and Teen
age Ninja Mutant Turtles.
To provide additional points of 
interest on the Midway, however,
in addition to the booths, the Car
nival entertainment committee 
will be hiring a caricaturist, 
mimes, and a Dixieland band 
that will wander around the 
Midway as it performs musical 
selections.
An arts and crafts festival will 
concurrently take place on the 
Cut, featuring works by not only 
students but also local artists, 
not to mention informational 
booths set up by organizations 
such as Amnesty International, 
the campus bookstore, and the 
National Panhellenic Conference 
(Panhel).
According to Jane Tshudy, co
ordinator for the festivities, many 
artists have already committed 
to displaying works at the show. 
Students interested in participat
ing in this facet of Spring Carni
val can contact Tshudy at x2107. 
A nominal fee will be charged to 
students exhibiting work at the 
show.
Tshudy is excited about the 
festival, an event which was miss
ing from Carnivals of recent years. 
It will be huge, she said, dis
playing the sheaf of responses she 
had received from interested art
ists and craftsmen. In addition to 
providing a new event, Tshudy
cited the fact that the arts and 
crafts festival will give the Carni
val a more unified look, with 
vendors in a planned space.
This years Carnival will also 
feature considerable musical di
versity. Over twelve different mu
sical groups have committed to 
performing this year. The bands 
will cover the gamut from reggae 
music with The Flow, to a wan
dering Dixieland band (The Boil
ermaker 5), to Top 40 with Foxx, 
to Carnegie Mellons own Kiltie 
Band. Scotland Yard will add 
even more variety to the musical 
entertainment by hosting a caba
ret on Thursday, highlighting stu
dent performers such as Matt 
Ireland and Robin Gardners folk 
talents.
A number of campus organiza
tions have prepared a variety of 
student competitions for this 
years new and improved carni
val . A Phi 0 is sponsoring a Ch aritable Chairs musical chairs com
petition on Saturday. A Sync 
Along competition will also be 
held on Saturday, testing stu
dents imaginary musical abili
ties.
If more sedentary contests are 
your style, Student Dormitory 
Council will be running a bingo
The new Midway will work around campus construction to allow for more Carnival fun than ever before.
game in the tent on Saturday at 
noon. And if you dont win any
thing at those competitions, you 
can try for the big prize Friday 
night at the SDC suitcase dance.
Of course, the traditional Car
nival events will all be taking 
place this year, including Buggy,
Scotch n Soda with their new 
production This is Not a Test, 
and opening and closing 
ceremonies. On Saturday the 
Activities Board will hold its En
tertainment Spotlight Comedy 
Concert at 8:00 pm. AB will pres
ent a concert on the Cut on Sun
day at 2 pm.
The Spring Carnival Commit
tee is still looking for security moni
tors, ticket sellers, and arts and 
crafts vendors. If you are inter
ested in any of these, please leave 
your name and number at the 
Skibo Information desk.

Tartan Staffwriter
The University of Pitts
burghs Theatre Arts Depart
ment brings to a close another 
successful season with their 
production of C. P. Taylors And 
A Nightingale 
Sang..., which runs 
March 31 through 
April 22.
Taylor spins a 
tale of life on the 
English homefront 
during World War
II. Through the eyes 
of Helen Stott we 
shall see the touch
ing and sometimes 
comic moments 
that mark her fam
ilys life as they 
struggle through 
the wartime crises.
Her fond rememberances shine as 
she guides her sis
ter, Joyce, through 
a shaky marriage to 
a young soldier 
while she herself 
tries to cope with 
her own romance 
with a married 
man.
Mavourneen 
Dwyer, Pitt faculty 
member and direc
tor of this produc
tion, calls And A 
Nightingale Sang... a funny and 
hopeful play. Its message is 
one of courage and hope, and 
the music and singing in it that 
link the scenes together are 
difficult to resist. Against a 
background of war, the Stott 
family and their friends con
tinue to prove that folks are 
funny, but families are funnier.
Dwyer continues, I have been 
intrigued by And A Nightingale 
Sang... ever since I first read a 
review in the New Yorker of its 
firstBroadway production a few 
years ago. Once I had got hold of 
a script, I determined to do the
play, sometime, somewhere and 
soon. Aside from the Cinderella 
theme so central to the story and 
so appealing to the audience, the 
play calls up a wealth of memo
ries from the mind and heart. You 
dont have to have been alive 
during World War II to recognize 
the rich comic characters and 
situations in the play. If you were,
however, your delight will be 
returned to you twofold. 
Dwyer joined the Pitt The
atre Arts faculty in 1987 after 
working as artistic director of 
the Zachary Scott Theatre 
Center in Austin, Texas for six 
years.
Anne Louise 
Bannon will be 
starring in the 
play in the role 
of Helen. A 
graduate of the 
University of 
Windsor in 
Canada, she is 
working toward 
de
gree in acting at 
Pitt. Helens 
sister, Joyce, is 
played by Jane 
Gentry, a
graduate of 
Kent State Uni
versity and now 
an M.F.A. stu
dent at Pitt.
Also appear
ing in the play 
will be Robert 
Graham as
Norman and 
Jack Price as 
Grandpa. The 
scenic designer 
is William J. 
Winsor and 
Lorraine Venberg is the cos
tume designer.
And A Nightingale Sang... 
previews March 31 through 
April 2 and opens April 5 in 
Pitts Studio Theatre in the 
Cathedral of Learning. Curtain 
time is 8 pm Wednesdays 
through Saturdays and 2 pm 
on Sundays. For tickets, call 
the box office at 624-7529.

'his semesters second Cham%ne Flights to the Dog Races 
>ught over 50 people to the 
rbes Gallery last Thursday 
jere three writing majors entained, reflected, and informed. 
The student readings are sponed by the Carnegie Mellon 
iters Guild and are considby most people in the Eng} Department to be the most 
portant readings at CMU.
he Flights are organized by 
dor English major Valerie 
amcyk. I really enjoy doing 
p, she said, especially when 
many people come out.
"he crowd is usually a very 
[erse one. While no particular 
idents are required to attend 
[readings, writing students are 
jouragedi Audience members 
lude technical and arts stuits as well as faculty and staff 
nibers.
he gallery is the perfect spot

jce is only broken up in a few 
[ces by columns or sculptures, 
jce there are no chairs for the

iut the space for people to sit. 
je mood is always one of comfort 
^creativity. One is surrounded

p thing missing is a string 
irtet playing in a corner.
Jackie Quinn began the eve8 with a story entitled Flame.
a very rich story about a 
|n who is friends with a coy 
Ptress who happens to own 
deli where he has lunch most 
e time. She has invited him 
to her place to help her repaint

up in wondering what an affair 
with her would be like. The crowd 
enjoyed the sparse but realistic 
dialogue as the two cracked off 
one liners at each other.
In a somewhat more somber 
tone, junior Dan Bidwa stepped 
up to the podium to read a series 
of poetry. He began by stating, 
These are my words. This is my 
life. He also characterized him
self as a wordsmith instead of 
the more common wordmaster 
because he often has a difficult 
time expressing his ideas through 
his writing. Most of the poems 
dealt with a traveling theme be
cause Bidwa claims to spend a lot 
of his time either walking to school 
or on the Pennsylvania Turnpike 
driving home. It was a series of 
very reflective poems which 
seemed very well crafted, but it 
was Bidwas sincerity that made 
them special.
After an intermission which al
lowed the audience to converse 
with the writers and take in the 
current exhibit at the gallery, Rob 
Fields took his turn.
Fields, a senior, read non-fic
tion from his personal essays 
w,hich he wrote as part of a NonFiction Workshop class. The idea, 
as he explained it, is to begin
writing about 
one thing and 
thenexpandon 
it  branch 
off.
When asked 
before the 
reading if he 
would be pre
senting fiction, 
Fields replied 
with a laugh, 
No, no, its just 
the truth; real 
life.
The first es
say, titled About My Dad, was 
just that; a series of thoughts and 
attitudes about Fields father and 
his relationship with him. This 
was a very moving piece because 
it revealed so much of Fields per
sonal character.
Fields preempted his second 
piece by saying, Now, on the 
lighter side. This one, titled 
Security Blankets, began with 
Fields talking about how his own 
blanket saved him from monsters 
when he was a child. It began to 
branch into a discussion about 
how having a security blanket is 
fashionable. The essay went on to 
how smoking has become an adult 
version of the security blanket. 
He brought out a lot of very inter
esting and well-thought-out 
points in this essay. The audience 
was responsive and showed their 
approval with loud and enthusi
astic applause.
There will be another reading 
this Thursday, March 23, featur
ing a one-act play by Kathy Streiff, 
fiction from Carey McDougall, and 
a series of poems by Anne-Marie 
Harvey. As usual, the Flights will 
begin at 7 pm at the Forbes Gal
lery. The Gallery is located at the 
comer of Forbes and Margaret 
Morrison.
Sheridan brings laughs home

A member of the small but energetic crowd at ABs dance last Friday 
night expresses his enthusiasm with Not Even's performance.

irtan Contributing Editor
Comedian Rondell Sheridan 
ought his show of hunting 
iimor, jokes about majors, and 
tries from his past to the Skibo 
llroom Saturday night. 
Sheridan, a veteran of the ed
ge circuit, obviously knew his 
iwd. The majority of the jokes
were about college life, and the 
various vices of college students 
from sex to alcohol (not excluding 
the combination of those two.)
Most of his show seemed to be 
led by the crowd  segues from 
one section of his act to another 
were prefaced by questions to the 
audience, thereby setting up the 
opening jokes.
The act closed with his trade
mark routine, a stirring direction 
of Thats the Way (Uh-Huh, UhHuh) I Like It. Sheridan may be 
the only person in America who 
does not remember the songs 
chorus and had to use printed 
cards to substitute.
Sheridan was brought to cam
pus by Activities Board Coffee
house (Entertainment Spotlight.) The Washington D.C. band, Not Even, gave a spirited performance in the Skibo Ballroom last Friday night. 
Two thumbs up!

Attendance at the event was

was in search of free green beer, 
Not Even gave a good show for 
those who chose to participate. 
The next AB dance is scheduled 
for the Thursday of Carnival. The 
featured band will be New York

Three Russian works led by the 
music director of the Moscow 
. Philharmonic were the program 
for the Pittsburgh Symphony this 
weekend in Heinz Hall in a sea
son pleasantly balanced between 
the Germanic repertoire and what 
usually is lumped together as 
everything else. To open the 
concert, conductor Dimitri 
Kitaienko began with the RimskyKorsakov Russian Easter 
Overture in a quite interesting 
reading. The opening phrases, 
derived from chant, were particu
larly limpid and filled with char
acter, in contrast to the often bl and 
treatment they get from many 
^orchestras. Kitaienko, however, 
jailed to give the orchestra enough 
;4?finition to avoid a few uncerentrances in the openingbars. 
The allegro sections of the overwture seemed not to be as fiery and 
, aggressive as other performances 
and recordings I have heard, but 
-at the same time succeeded in 
balancing the character of the slow 
sections.
Swiss-born oboist Heinz Holliger was soloist in the U.S. pre
WBMdullWM
with Chris Fectecm
miere of the other work on the 
first half - the Edison Denisov 
Concerto for Oboe. Soloist, con
ductor, and orchestra collaborated 
well for an excellent performance, 
and yet the work as a whole 
seemed not to leave a marked 
impression on the bulk of the 
audience. Most of the comments 
one heard at intermission (as well 
as the thoughts running through 
my mind) had more to do with 
Holligers wonderful sound than 
with what should be an impor
tant new work in the oboe reper
toire. The greatest achievement 
of this avant-garde work was a 
demonstration of the wide extent 
of both Holligers and the oboes 
technical and musical capabili
ties. The use of extended 20th
century techniques like mul
tiphonics and quarter tone writ
ing were both natural and un
forced and seemed perfectly ap
propriate in context. In his use of 
the oboe as an instrument of true 
virtuostic capabilities and in his 
orchestral colorings the composer 
shows a great talent. However, it 
is these very successes that eclipse 
a weaker coherence in the larger 
formal structures of the work. 
Compositionally speaking, this is 
one work that unfortunately re
quires more than one listening 
for a good understanding.
After intermission the sole work 
was the Scriabin Symphony No.
3, subtitled Divine Poem by the 
composer. It was in this final work 
that the orchestra and conductor
seemed to work together the best. 
Where in the opening work of the 
program Kitaienkos gestures 
sometimes appeared insufficient, 
the communication that took place 
in the Scriabin rendered all no
tions of technique useless. The 
string sound that the orchestra 
seems to have developed in the 
past year is wonderfully silky and 
sensuous, and I dare say at least 
as warm as the famous strings 
of the Philadelphia Orchestra of 
the past. With time Im certain 
that even the subtleties of the 
early classical repertoire (Mozart, 
Haydn) will become comfortable 
for the orchestra.
The PSO will not give subscrip
tion concerts this coming week
end but for those staying in town 
over break there is a set of con
certs the following weekend. 
Eduardo Mata, recently named 
principal guest conductor for the 
89-90 season, will conduct a 
program of works by Gluck, Bar
tk, and Ravel on Thursday, 
March 30 at 8 pm, Friday, March 
31 at 8:30 pm, and Sunday, April
2 at 2:30 pm.
In the CMU Mu^ic Department 
there are several interesting 
events in the next week. Tonight 
at 8 pm the Cuarteto Latinoameri
cano gives its final program of 
their CMU series for the year 
with works by Haydn, de Vega, 
Schostakovich, and Schubert in 
the lecture hall of Mellon Insti
tute. Wednesday evening the 
Carnegie Mellon Philharmonic 
plays under the direction of resi
dent conductor Keith Lockhart at 
Carnegie Music Hall in Oakland. 
The program features Heiko 
Kallenbach as soloist in the Kirka 
Marimba Concerto and soprano 
Betsy Lawrence in Monicas Waltz 
from The Medium by Menotti. 
Also on the program are works by 
Janacek and Dvorak, including 
the latters Symphony No. 8.
If you dont plan on leaving early 
for vacation (or, if youre like me 
and have to use Spring Break to 
catch up on work) there is one 
event on Friday at 8 pm in the 
Alumni Concert Hall, CFA. In an 
independently organized concert, 
students of the Music Department 
will perform all six of Bachs
Brandenburg Concertos. Th 
evening will be decidedly le; 
formal than most concerts in t}, 
department, and could prove t 
be very enjoyable.
One final event that should \ 
mentioned before break is the nej 
Renaissance and Baroque So< 
ety presentation, this time a con 
cert performance of Purcells oj 
era Dido and Aeneas. Paired^ 
Monteverdis Combattimento { 
Tancredi e Clorinda, the Pure 
will be performed by Andre 
Parrott, conductor, Musics Ret 
reation, the Pittsburgh Camei 
ata, and several vocal soloist 
including soprano Julianne Bairt 
All the artists in the concert ai 
well known to Pittsburgh aud 
ences for their previous perforn 
ances and, with the direction of 
major authentic performance 
figure like Parrott, an excitir 
evening is very probable. Tj 
concert takes place at Synod Ha 
(125 N. Craig St.) on Frida, 
March 31 and Saturday, April 
both evenings at 8 pm. Call 68

Ill be danged if Bush didnt ban 
all the AK-47 Kalashnikov semi
automatic assault rifles last week, 
and it stopped an order of 451 had 
comingin from Bangkok, and now 
I2m gonna have to cancel all my 
tenting trips this spring. Usu
ally, this time of year, 30 or 40 of 
ilS'go out to West Texas and hunt 
prairie dogs with AK-47s. Last 
year we bagged about 43,000 of 
the little suckers, but we wont 
get nowhere near that using con
ventional weapons. And Ill tell 
you one goldum thing, Mr. Bush 
if somebody gets hurt out there 
this year, his blood is on your 
hands.
The truth of the matter is, you 
need an AK-47 these days, or at 
least an M-l, if youre gonna 
compete with the modem prairie 
dog. Three years ago  Ill never 
forget this  my buddy Vince 
Gabbert went ahead of us to recon 
a ridge on our flank, and as soon 
as he stuck his head up over the 
crest, a unit of about 30 prairie 
dogs flung themselves at his face. 
Fortunately, he was able to 
squeeze off700 rounds and pretty 
much turn the p.d.s into little 
salad-bar croutons, but he was a 
shaken man when he worked his 
way back to base camp.
I want you to think about that, 
Mr. Bush. You say these weapons 
arent needed for sporting. I want 
you to think about what would
have happened to Vince if he 
hadnt had the needed firepower 
that day. Would he have a face? 
Would a .22 have done the same 
job?
I think not.
With each passing year, the 
prairie dog turns into a wiser and 
more dangerous adversary. Sure, 
in the beginning all they did was 
burrow little holes in dirt piles. 
But last season we stumbled onto 
a village of prairie dogs that was 
surrounded by triple-strand 
barbed wire, booby-trapped with 
slingshot mines. Of course, it was 
prairie-dog-sized barbed wire, so 
we were able to step on it and 
remove the obstacles. But my 
point is that we have an en
trenched and resistant enemy 
with no interest in westem-style 
democracy. I dont know if youve 
ever seen your best friend get a 
mesquite thorn directly in the 
cheek from a p.d. slinger. But 
Ill tell you this. Once you see it, 
youll never again hesitate to pour 
1,200 rounds of lead into the little 
furry cheeks of a resisting rodent.
Let me tell 
you how bad its 
gotten. Two 
years ago, just 
outside ' of 
White flat, 
Texas, in Mot
ley County, four 
of us were am
bushed by prairie dog mortar fire 
that, as near as we could tell, was 
being launched from a copse of 
elm trees. We hit the dirt, covered 
our heads, and slowly worked our 
way toward the trees, dragging 
our bodies along with our elbows. 
But when we got close, suddenly 
the firing stopped. There was 
nothing but silence, for better than 
15 minutes. Then Sam Wilkins, 
covering our left flank, spotted a 
single prairie dog. He had moved 
just beyond the tree line, into the 
open space in front of us. He stared 
straight ahead, then slowly, like 
he was in a trance, he began to 
dance. It was a weird, mesmeriz
ing dance. If youve ever seen a 
belly dancer in a Tunisian restau
rant that kind of dance. He had 
a tiny flute with him. The flute 
couldnt have been any bigger than 
a little girls finger nail. He began 
to play Ukrainian folk melodies, 
dancing all the while. None of us 
said a word. Then Sam Wilkins, 
without warning, screamed Hes 
just shimmied for the last time! 
and he squeezed off a terrifying
barrage. The dancing, 
flute-playing prairie dog 
disintegrated, vanished, 
blown into a thousand 
pieces.
But Sam had given 
away our position. Within 
15 minutes all three of 
my friends were dead. I 
only managed to survive 
by rolling down an em
bankment, abandoning 
my backpack, and travel
ing only by night for three 
days.
I know what happened 
now.
The prairie dogs were 
directly underneath us all 
that timethousands of 
them, waiting for us to make one 
wrong noise. The dancing prairie 
dog gave his life so that the others 
might live.
This is not like any enemy man 
has ever faced.
And they say we dont need AK47s to hunt with.
Speaking of hugely gratifying 
violence, Police Academy 6 is 
out. It may be a little better than 
Police Academy 3, although not 
as good as Police Academy 1. 
Its definitely a cut above Police
"And I'll tell you one goldurn 
thing, Mr. Bush  if some
one gets hurt out there this 
year, the blood is on your 
hands ... The truth of the 
matter is, you need an AK-47 
these days, or at least an M1, if you're gonna compete 
with the modern prairie dog.
Academy 4, but of course, Police 
Academy 4 is the worst one ever 
made, the one with the giant 
balloon race.
In fact, now that I think of it, its 
probly the second best one, just a 
little bit better than Police Acad
emy 5, mainly because they told 
Janet Jones to take a hike. Any
how, theyre back to basics, with 
Tackleberry firing off handguns 
the size of Montana, Callahan 
and her two enormous talents

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  21 March 1989
By STEPHEN GLICKER
Tartan Staffwriter
Its that time of year again; 
spring break. Some of you are 
going home, some of you are stay
ing here, while others are lucky 
enough to escape from it all in 
Florida. For those of you who 
arent members of the scum soci
ety heading south, you will have a 
little over a week with practically 
nothing to do. With that in mind, 
this week I decided to review two 
movies that I doubt most of you 
have seen Sleuth and The Day 
of the Jackal.
Sleuth is a movie based on the 
long running play by Anthony 
Shaffer, who also wrote Alfred 
Hitchcocks Frenzy. Both movies 
iare similar in that they both are 
extremely ironic and play horri
bly with your mind.
The story starts out with a man 
:named Andrew Wyke (Sir Lau
rence Olivier), who is a mystery 
writer and is in a large maze made 
of shrubbery with no way in or 
out. Wyke is a game-player. He 
loves games to the point that no
Yowwon Jtiht uacrw iuuon wewCotwo iyon wCnat6 ,nokJ
matter where in his house you 
turn, you will find a game. You 
name it, hes got it. He also likes 
to play games with people, and 
one day poor Milo Tindle (Mi
chael Caine) comes along.
Wyke detests Milo for several 
reasons. He is only half-British, 
he has the wrong accent, and he is 
having an affair with Wykes wife. 
However, the only person Wyke 
hates more than Milo is his own 
wife. So Wyke devises a scheme to 
try on with Milo.
Wyke is completely willing to 
give up his wife, but only if he is
That way Milo will have a small 
fortune and Wykes wife, and 
Wyke will collect on the insur
ance money and no longer have 
his wife.
Up to this point everything in 
Sleuth seems completely normal
 but dont despair, the plot gets 
thick and juicy soon enough. Milo 
and Wyke play their little game, 
but not with lighthearted spirts. 
Instead, they become ferocious 
and insulting to one another to 
the point that they forget all about 
Wykes wife and get consumed a 
game of cat and mouse. Giving
away the rest of the story would 
be a federal offense, but lets just 
say that it is a lot like House of 
Games.
This movie is simply incredible, 
especially the lead performances 
by Olivier and Caine. Good sus
pense/mystery movies are hard 
to come by, but this is one of the 
gems. Rent this movie, watch it 
with a lot of friends, and get ready 
to hit that rewind button, for you 
might not believe what you see.
The Day of the Jackal is a great 
book, and is also one hell of a 
movie. The Jackal (Edward Fox) 
is the codename of a British citi
zen whos a professional assassin. 
He allegedly killed Trujillo of the 
Dominican Republic in 1961. It is 
now 1963, and he has been hired 
by a group of Frenchmen who 
want de Gaulle dead. His price is 
$500,000, which he doesnt think 
is expensive, considering that he 
is handing France to these people 
on a silver platter.
The rest of the movie centers 
around how The Jackal is going to 
assassinate de Gaulle. He pre
pares two disguises, three identi
ties, gets a legal passport by 
applying in the name of a child 
who died in 1931, and gets the 
coolest gun you have ever seen. 
He calls on a European friend and 
receives a hand-made lightweight 
rifle with a silencer, sniper scope, 
and explosive bullets. He finally 
gets identity papers and a drivers 
license and enters France.
Meanwhile, back on the home 
front, the French government has 
gotten a tip that an attempt will 
be made on de Gaulles life. Of 
course de Gaulle insists that he 
will make no changes in his plans, 
and wants the French police to 
secretly contact other nations to 
find out who this Jackal person is. 
The only problem is that no one 
has any idea who this guy is.
The rest of the movie shows 
how the French government at
tempts to stop him, which is re
ally fascinating. The Jackal is 
cornered several times, but Wever 
escapes by luck. Rather, for one of 
the first times that I can remem
ber seeing in a movie, he escapes 
by using his intelligence and 
nerve.
This movie is magnificent. Not 
only is the acting extremely con
vincing, but the settings are sim
ply incredible. This movie was 
shot (at a great cost) all over 
Europe, and it shows. The film is 
two and a half hours long, but it 
never gets slow or boring. Unless 
you had a watch on you would 
think that it was over in hlf an 
hour because it is so exciting. As 
a matter of fact, I lost all my fin
gernails to this movie, because I 
was biting them off.

Less than a week to spring 
break. Hooray.
If youre headed towards a beach 
of sorts, be forewarned: you will 
endup hearing the same five songs 
all week. Top forty is king of the 
sand - no kidding, its bigger than 
classic tracks, surprising as that 
may be - and youll have to take 
precautionary measures if you 
dont want to come home with the 
latest Madonna time permanently 
etched into the remnants of your 
brain.
Youll need some sort of musical 
sunscreen. Sort through your 
record/CD/cassette collection, and 
put all the songs you can think of 
on one cassette - less bulk, less 
hassle, and you dont have to wade 
through all the shitty songs on 
the rest of the albums. You could 
just buy a few compilations, but 
they almost always have a few 
Teally shitty tunes on them, and 
they never have all the good ones 
you want to hear. Besides, youd 
have to re-record it anyway, or 
risk destroying your original copy.
Anyway, what all this is getting 
at is that there a few records that 
you probably havent heard (or 
heard of) that would do your tape 
mess a whole bunch of good. So,
Mi'sic Mrsic Music 
In 
Distin
what we have here is a set of 
directions to give you at least one 
side of a comp tape that you and 
whoever youre with might want 
to listen to a few times. Go. out, 
buy a couple of 90 minute tapes, 
then take this column to Jims or 
Eides (or an enlightened friends 
record collection) and buy every
thing in italics. Well wait.
All right, time to get started. 
First up on side one is side one of 
Sly Dunbar and Robbie 
Shakespeares Rhythm Killers on 
the tape. Sly and Robbie have 
always been responsible for some 
of reggaes best beats, and Rhythm 
Killers is their attempt to mix 
reggae with rap, funk, and go-go. 
The resulting album is enough to 
get anyone jumping around like 
an idiot, and the three songs on 
side one all run together, so its 
like a huge dance mix.
Fifteen minutes down. Grab the 
Colors soundtrack and put Paid 
In Full, by Eric B. and Rakim on 
next. The basic tune was on one of
their earlier ,al
bums, but this is 
the overblown mix 
that pulls bits from 
Ofra Haza and 
MlAIRIRIS and 
was what you 
probably heard in 
any decent club this 
summer. (Metropol is not what I 
had in mind.) Speaking of 
MIAIRIRIS, put Pump Up The 
Volume on the tape next. (Get 
the American version of the Pump 
Up The Volume EP - it has the 
4th and BWay logo on it, as well 
as a bunch of cool-patches that 
arent on the English version.)
Twenty-five minutes down. 
Snag Fishbones UP Fishbone, and 
put Party At Ground Zero on 
next. Again, this is one of those 
songs that youve probably heard 
before but never knew just who 
did it. Its great ska, everyone 
listening will start dancing, and 
everyone will think youre really 
cool. Pat yourself on the back, and 
stick Blondies Heart of Glass 
on, just so theres something on 
here that everyone recognizes. Its 
on their Greatest Hits LP, or the 
American Gigolo soundtrack, 
which you wont find.
Thirty-five minutes down. Put 
Yellos Oh Yeah on next; its on 
the Ferris Bueller soundtrack or
any number of Yello albums, 
including 1980-1985: The New 
Mix In One Go. Then put on Bow 
Wow Wows I Want Candy (off 
their I Want Candy LP), and stick 
whatever New Order tune off Sub
stance fits into the space you have 
left, and youre done with side one 
of your hip comp tape.
Side two is your own problem.
Those of you staying in Pitts
burgh can skip the recorded stuff 
and go see the real thing. Lots of 
good things are going to be at the 
Sonic Temple, among other clubs, 
like the Laughing Hyenas, Igni
tion, and Knifedance on Friday, 
and Scrawl, Volcano Suns, and 
Roger Miller on the next Friday. 
Ignition is the first band from the
D.C. Dischord label to play in 
Pittsburgh in years andis enough 
of a reason to go see that show 
alone. Volcano Suns REALLYlike 
Scrawl (which is why theyre 
opening), Roger Miller used to be 
in some band called Mission of 
Burma (and hes recorded a solo 
album called Birdsongs of the 
Mesozoic), and the show is going 
to be an event. No kidding. If that 
werent enough, the Violent 
Femmes will be in town on April 
first. How could a beach be any 
better?

tonic Temple hosts April 
Fools improvisation
PB CHRIS FECTEAU
|'Tartan Staffwriter
 Improvisation on a large scale 
gs the agenda for a Sonic Temple 
oncert on April Fools Day.
Organized by Pittsburgh bas
est Chris Koenigsberg and his 
jlorphic Resonance Trio (with 
assoonist Jason Gibbs and saxo
phonist Ben Opie), the concert 
also include as many as a 
ftozen other musicians, many of 
J,hom have never met.
I Koenigsberg will be a conducjor of sorts, but his responsibiJjes in that line involve creating 
Inly the very high-level forms of 
he music, with the details to be 
[lied in by the other musicians in 
iny way they wish. Chinese poet 
Ms, Yun Wang will join the enjemble for readings of some anlient Chinese ritual poetry, with 
(he improvised accompaniment 
If the ensemble.
Koenigsberg said recently about 
the concert, If you come to the 
show expecting to hear traditional 
rock and roll, or jazz, or classical 
music, or New Age music, you 
maybe disappointed. Butyouwill 
certainly hear elements of all 
these and more.
He also called the evening an 
experiment and stressed that 
people who attend leave their 
expectations of one thing or an
other at home.
Among those expected to make 
up The Morphic Resonance Large 
Eclectic Ensemble are Roger Dannenburg, trumpeycomputer, J ohn 
Deley, synthesizer, and of course 
Koenigsberg, Gibbs and Opie.
April Fools Day couldnt be 
more appropriately celebrated 
than with an evening of improvi
sation. The concert takes place 
April 1 at 8 pm at the Sonic 
Temple, 747 South Ave., Wilkinsburg.

Shane
This 1953 western stars Alan Ladd as Shane, a 
retired gunfighter who comes out of retirement to 
help a group of homesteaders against cattlemen who 
are trying to take their land. Jack Palance plays the

Angela Lansbury, Kevin Kline, Linda Ronstadt,

John Cleese, Jamie Lee Curtis, Kevin Kline, and

I this movie is worth the $1  a fanny, silly comedy.

Tom Cruise stars as a flashy bartender who even

Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid
Paul Newman and Robert Redford star as the 
title characters in this romanticized retelling of the 
jlegend of Butch Cassidy. The movie, released in 
11969, is short on plot but very long on humor. 
Definitely worth seeing, if only for the witty repartee 
between Newman and Redford.
