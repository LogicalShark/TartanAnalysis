Sororities 
Pledge 66
Formal Rushing Ends 
With Ballot Check
Tuesday, October 16, at 5:00 was 
an important moment for the sor
ority girls on campus. This hour 
officially ended formal rushing 
for the eligible rushees.
Monday morning, October 15, 
began the complicated procedure 
of matching the rushees choice 
with that of the sorority. At 10 
oclock the sororities submitted a 
list of the girls they wanted to 
bid. An half hour later the rushees 
marked their ballots with as many 
as three preferences.
Finished Tuesday
By 5 oclock the Dean of Women 
and representatives of Pittsburgh 
Pan Hellenic Association matched 
the ballots and returned the re
sults to the sororities. Invitations 
were available for the chosen girls 
Tuesday morning after 10:30, and 
their response was received by the 
sorority at 5:00 Tuesday afternoon.
The following girls are pledging

New Election 
Necessary 
For Freshmen
Re-elections for freshman class 
president will be held on Tues
day, October 30, at 11:30. Cam
paigning will be permitted dur
ing the two full school days pre
ceding the elections, Friday and 
Monday.
No posters larged than 11 inches 
by 14 inches will be allowed. Any 
other active campaigning is per
mitted.
The re-elections are necessary 
because of a discrepancy in vot
ing. Some freshmen voted twice, 
using both the original cards and 
the, new identification cards.
Carnegie Deficit 
Laid To Inflation, 
Lower Enrollment
Providing a sharp insight into 
Carnegies 1951 - 1952 financial 
problems, President Warner, has 
revealed that estimated income 
falls $285,000 short of meeting 
budgeted expenses. This compares 
with a $205,000 difference last 
year.
He said the larger gap$80,000 
to current inflation.
If inflationary pressures con
tinue to grow, our problem will 
be intensified, he declared.
The difference of $205,000 be
tween estimated income and out
lay in 1950-1951 was further 
heightened by belowr-normal en
rollment, Dr. Warner explained. 
But this was offset by certain 
budget savings, by unexpected ex
tra dividends on endowment in
vestments, by gifts and grants 
that could be applied to the 
budget, and by money drawn from 
a reserve fund previously unear
marked."
However, some of these sources 
may not always be available, he 
added.
He said, We hope Carnegie will 
be able to obtain gifts and grants 
from industry, alumni and friends 
adequate to bridge the gap be
tween regular income and the ex
pense budget needed to maintain 
th highest quality In our educa
tional and research programs.

Superior Airpower Necessary, 
Homecoming Speaker Warns
Major Genera] Putt Tells Alumni Audience 
Of Need For Increased Research, Production
Warning that Russias airpower is superior in quantity to the 
airpower of all the free nations combined, Major General Donald L. 
Putt, acting deputy chief of staff in charges of Air Force development, 
declared Saturday that freedom of the air hinges on IA S. ability
to obtain superiority in quality of*------------------------------------------------
airpower.
Speaking at the alumni Home-engineer versus engineercampus 
versus campus. For the strugglecoming luncheon, he laid the . _ .problem squarely in the lap of, Russia and in America
Americas universities, stating:
The stakes were never higher, 
the issues never clearer. Freedom 
of the air hangs in the balance.
And the balances of world power 
leads straight to the American ^e'^. 
campus. This is the challenge
ters in the university, the key to 
scientific knowledge.
Time No Help 
Time is no longer on the side 
of the U. S., he warned, but on
the greatest challenge of the cen
tury.'
Ability To Communicate
He defined freedom of the air 
as our ability to communicate 
freely with the people of all na
tions and explained how Russia 
has built her aggressive dicta
torship behind closed doors and 
under airspace. Russia controls 
the airspace above fully onethird of the earth, he pointed out, 
and has isolated her people from 
a true understanding of world 
conditions, creating a continual 
threat of all-out war and a major 
barrier to all-out peace.
The underlying issue of the 
day is isolation of the air versus 
freedom of the air.
The challenge of tomorrow is 
being met today in our laborator
ies, he asserted. This conflict 
pits physicist versus physicist
MMCC Seminar 
Room Is Named 
For Professor
A new MMCC seminar room was 
named in honor of Professor Har
old L. Lang who is head of CITs 
Department of General Science. 
The room was dedicated at 10:30 
Saturday morning during Home
coming.
The Lang Seminar Room will be 
used for senior seminar talks and 
as a special science study room. 
It was made possible through a 
gift of Mr. and Mrs. Alfred S. An
drews of Cleveland, 'Ohio, both 
1928 graduates of Carnegie.
Mrs. Edith Alexander, dean of 
Margaret Morrison, was on hand 
to greet the alumni, faculty, and 
present science students. Main 
speaker at the affair was presi
dent J. C. Warner.
One of the first graduates of the 
science department, Marguerite 
Spilman, told of the founding of 
the department in Margaret Mor
rison.
he indicated, can choose the mo
ment and place to strikewe will 
never take the first step, There
fore, he said, this country cannot 
afford to let its technological dis
coveries sit on the shelf.
He outlined an Air Force pro
gram of 1,098 university-operated 
research and development projects 
set up to actively improve U. S. 
quality of airpower. By July 1952, 
these development contracts will 
total 100 million dollars, he esti
mated.
The task of achieving superior 
quality of airpower could at one 
time be plotted by military men, 
but that time has long passed, he 
declared. In World War II we 
measured our firepower in terms 
of bullets. Tomorow it must be 
measured in electro-magnetic 
waves. We are now engaged in a 
battle for electronic command of 
the air.
Four Objectives
He cited freedom from human 
frailty as one of four long-range 
objectives of the U. S. Air Force. 
Others, he said, are freedom from 
want and waste, freedom from 
enemy interference, and freedom 
from natural limitations of flight.
General Putt, who commanded 
the Hermann Goering Aeronauti
cal Research Establishment 
Wright Field of Germanyin 
1945, 'received a distinguished 
achievement award at the alumni 
luncheon. A 1928 Carnegie grad
uate, he is the second to receive 
it.
Created last year, the first 
award went to Charles E. Wilson, 
General Motors president, who 
graduated from Carnegie in 1909.

Tartan Contest . ~39-0 In Homecoming Contest
 Confident Running and Passing, Aggressive 
Lineplay Mark Third Straight Plaid Victory
Plaid Lineman 
Of The Week
Tartan vote for lineman of the 
week goes this week to right end 
Tom Claig. Both a hard hitting 
blocker and an able pass catcher, 
Craig shone in the Allegheny 
game Saturday, catching a pass for 
the first touchdown and throwing 
key blocks which led to others. 
In addition to his blocking and 
pass-shagging, Craigs punting 
ability has proved especially val
uable to the Plaid during Captain 
Arne Obergs injury absence.
Craig, who is a junior in Me
chanical Engineering and hails 
from East McKeesport, Pa., is 
playing his first season of inter
collegiate football. Both a football 
and basketball letterman in high 
school, Craig devoted his first two 
years at Carnegie to varsity 
basketball under coach Mel Cratsley before reporting for football 
this fall.
Winner of last weeks Tartan 
football contest was Jim Makris, 
sophomore metallurgist. Jim 
slipped up on two of Saturdays 
games, but called the other eight 
correctly.
Another contestant, Frank Car
ter, also got eight right, but was 
edged by Makris when it came to 
predicting game scores.
A crowd of 5000 homecoming fans saw Dr. Eddie Bakers Car

defeat at Carnegie Homecoming.
determined team from Allegheny 
by a 39-0 score.
Twenty of the Carnegie pointers 
came in the second quarter as the 
Plaid put the game on ice quickly 
and then played under wraps for 
the remaining periods. In the sec
ond half, reserves tallied two ad
ditional TDs to run the score to 
39 for the Scots.
Aggressive lineplay and a con
fident running and passing attack 
featured the third straight Tartan 
win and their third in four games 
for the half-completed season. 
Skibo blocking was especially im
proved as it held the Gator ground 
attack to 70 yards while springing 
the Tartan backs loose for a total 
of 283.
Pass Defense Improved
Pass defense, hitherto a major 
weakness in the Plaid game, 
showed signs of improvement in 
the Gator game as the Hilltoppers 
were held to only 71 yards through 
the air. The Scot aerial attack 
rolled on as it amassed 248 yards 
and tallied three of the days six 
touchdowns.
The Gators of Allegheny made 
a contest of the opening minutes 
of the game as they stopped cold * 
on the two yard line a Tartan 
drive which had begun with the 
initial kickoff. The Skibos were 
not to be denied, however, and on 
possessing the pigskin again struck 
swiftly for their first score.
Taking an Allegheny punt on 
the midstripe, Carnegie scored in 
exactly two plays. After Irv 
Shechter had skipped around the 
Hilltopper left end to the 24, Quent 
Holtz connected on a long pass to 
Tom Craig in the end zone for the 
first TD.
Three Quick Onei 
The second quarter began like 
the first as the Gators again stop
ped a Tartan drive, this time on 
the six-inch line. However, the 
roof then fell in on Allegheny as 
the Skibos scored three quick 
touchdowns.
The first came as a result of Al
leghenys forced punt from their 
own end zone. Receiving the ball 
on the 35, the Tartans scored three 
plays later on a long pass from 
Holtz to Arne Oberg.
The second of the three touch
downs came with as astonishing 
rapidity as the first. Seemingly 
bogged down on their own 45 as a 
result of a 15 yard penalty, the 
Scots scored again on a long pass. 
Holtz connected with Fritz Wilson 
all alone behind the Gator sec
ondary and Wilson trotted over 
for the six-pointer.
26-0 at Half 
The last touchdown of the first 
half came on the prettiest run of 
the day. On the first play after 
Eddie Miller had run a Hilltopper 
punt back to the Allegheny 45, 
Arne Oberg went around left end, 
picked up beautiful downfield 
blocking and evaded a host of Al
legheny tacklers to make the in
termission score 26-0 for the Plaid.
In the second half two more 
touchdowns were added for the 
Skibos on plunges by fullbacks Gil 
Dissen and Don Skillin. Most of 
the first string saw little action as 
Dr. Baker saved his regulars as 
much as possible for this Satur
days game with Case Tech.

iou have to get up early in the morning to 
put one over on this cock-of-the-walk! When it 
came to making quick-trick experiments of 
cigarette mildness, he stated flatly, Thats strictly 
for clucks! How ya going to keep em down 
on the farmwhen they know theres one 
convincing way to prove cigarette mildness!
Its the sensible test ... the 30-day Camel 
Mildness Test, which simply asks you to try 
Camels as a steady smokeon a day after day 
basis. No snap judgments. Once youve enjoyed 
Camels for 30 days in your T-Zone (T for 
Throat, T for Taste), youll see why ..
