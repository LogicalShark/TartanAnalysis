MANY MEN TAKE 
GRADUATE WORK
Four Men Are Sent By U. S. 
Navy to Take 
Course
Despite the comparative infancy 
of the graduate course in metal
lurgy at Carnegie, the results of 
two years of concentrated work on 
a course leading to a ddctors de
gree arc very encouraging. The 
enrollment of graduate students in 
the department shows a 50 per 
cent increase over last year, and 
it is believed that Carnegie has the 
largest enrollment of this kind in 
the United States. The first can
didates for doctors degrees will be 
presented in the spring of 1932.
The post-graduate work in this 
field at Carnegie is not confined 
strictly to theory, the desirability 
of studying metallurgy where 'metal
lurgy is practiced is not being 
overlooked. As Carnegie is situate'd 
in tjie heart of the steel industry, 
it is quite easy to supplement the 
theoretical problems of laboratory 
and classroom wall practical study 
of the problems of mills.
The United States Navy has sent 
four graduates of the Naval Acad
emy to take the post-graduate 
coins: offered at Carnegie, and
more of these. men arc expected 
to come to this school later. To 
aid financially men desirous of con
tinuing their studies, five teaching 
fellowships have been provided by 
tin Departments of Chemistry and 
Mining and Metallurgy.
Through the courtesy of a much 
interested administration, the new 
and necessary equipment required 
by the department is gradually be
ing supplied. It is the wish of 
Dr. V. N. Krivobok, professor of 
metallurgy, to make the department 
at Carnegie one of the most thorj 
oughlv equipped of its kind in tin 
country, atid lie has incorporated 
some valuable plans for the rca!:zation of his wish.

Seriously Speaking
A Column of World News Events
By NATHAN MILLER
What Price Relief?
It is impossible to . hide the 
damaging fact that distress and
want born of prolonged unem
ployment will be the lot of mil
lions of American laborers and 
clerks this winter. In New York 
City alone, it is estimated that 
some 750,000 people will be in im
mediate need. A reliable statis
tician has added, that in the coun
try at large upward of 7,000,000 
wage earners will be without
gainful employment through no
fault of their own.
The problem of relief of. these 
millions has thus become the most 
critical emergency which the
country has had to face in years. 
Beside it, the prosecution of war 
pales. There has arisen a welter 
of opinion, discussion, assevera
tion and table-thumping on this 
gigantic problem. Through it all, 
one gleams an overwhelming 
amount of pure hokum and super
ficiality.
Our great and powerful indus
trial and financial leaders and our 
statesmen with few exceptions re
fuse to see the situation with 
clear and fearless vision. Fear 
seizes them that the dreaded 
"dole will be imposed; that 
Americans will be "pauperized or 
"degraded by unemployment in
surance or some such device, as 
though there could be anything 
more degrading or pauperizing 
than charity, breadlines or pursefilching of the community drive 
types.
For some, reason we have be
come so inured to ballyhoo in 
public life that we cannot under
take any ameliorative social meas
ure without having to call upon 
the specialists in bunkumadver
tising agencies, the radio, etc. A 
grave crisis like our present un
employment requires instead fun
damental searching, thinking and 
planning.

ART SCHOOL HAS 
DRAWING EXHIBIT
Plans For Shakespearean The
ater on View
An exhibition of architectural 
drawings depicting the various as 
pccts of the Folger Shakespeare 
Foundation in Washington, D. C., 
as conccivcd by Paul P. Cret, emi
nent Philadelphia architect, will be 
shown in the Hewlett Room on the 
first floor of the College of Fine 
Arts from Octobcr 26 to Novem
ber 7.
The group offers about 30 studies 
and sketches which present different 
solutions of the problem in forms 
of interest to the general public 
and of help to students of all arts.
One notable feature of the Foun
dation is the radical combination 
of types of architecture. The ex
terior is patterned in the modern 
classic style in order that it will 
conform with other buildings in 
the capital. However, in keeping 
with, the Shakespearean theme the 
interior is early Elizabethan.
The purpose of the building, 
which is a project of H. A. Folger, 
president of the Standard Oil Com
pany, is to house the owners col
lection of Shakespearean costumes 
and his library of approximately
75,000 books and manuscripts de
voted to Shakespeare and his works.
At a recent meeting of the Jun
ior Prom committee John L. 
Kroncnberg was elected to the 
general chairmanship. Mr. Kron

William H. Hauser, a junior in 
the College of Industries, treasur
er of the Alpha Tau Omega, social 
fraternity, a member of the Delta 
Skull, business manager of the 
Thistle, and a member of the Kil
tie Band, was elected assistant: 
chairman.
The members of the Junior 
Prom committee were appoinfed 
by the Junior Class presidents of 
the College of Fine Arts, the Col
lege of Industries, and the College 
of Engineering. Harold Cadmus, 
Jr., and Anthony J. 'Schmidt are 
the representatives of the Col
lege of Industries. Robert R. 
Smith and Robert A. Hutchinson 
represent the College of Engi
neering, and Frederick Flaherty 
and Lo;uis J. Manesiotis are rep
resentatives of the College of Fine 
Arts. .
The Mens Junior Prom is to be 
the only class dance held off the 
Campus during the first semester. 
The date for this years annual 
formal is February the twelfth. 
No definite decision has been made 
concerning the hotel at which the 
dance will be held.
In keeping with the suggestion 
of the Student Council no favors 
will be distributed at the Prom, 
thus, making possible a big saving 
that will be used in providing the 
best dance orchestra available. 
The price of the tickets is unde
termined as yet, but it is probably 
that it will be about the same as 
last 3-ear.

COUNCIL RULES 
SINGLE ELECTION
Students Will Assist in.Laying of Alumni Class 
Plates
At the Student Council meeting 
of October 20 it was decided that 
the upper-class elections of all four 
schools arc to be held on the same 
day. All four colleges arc to be 
under the elections committee of 
Student Council. Under this plan, 
elections for class officers and offi
cers of major organizations will be 
at the same time, thus eliminating 
confusion about dates and providing 
opportunity for the required pub
licity of names prior to elections, 
Margaret Morrison is to be allowed 
to continue to nominate through 
the open class assembly rather than 
through the petition method used 
by the other schools.
The presidents of Mortar Board 
and Dragons were asked to confer 
with Mr. Ovcrcnd with regard to 
assisting in the Alumni Ceremony 
of laying the bronze class plates 
in the foyer of the Administration 
Hall. In previous years the cere
mony was poorly attended but the 
student participation will no doubt 
foster interest in it. As usual the 
plates will be laid on the Friday 
afternoon previous to the CarnegicPitt game.
On the Budget committees rec
ommendation the budgets of the 
Military Ball, Tri-Publication Staff 
and the Carnegie Puppet were ap 
proved with the privilege of de
creasing the appropriation of the 
latter  two, should mid-semester 
registration fall off and make it 
necessary.
Student Council approved a re
newal of the agreement made last 
year between the councils of Car
negie and Pitt in an effort to limit 
invasions of either campus by mem
bers of the other school before the 
annual Carnegje-Pitt football game.
A gold activities key was awarded 
to Juanita Canada who through 
some mistake did not receive her 
key for four years work orr the

Contents of College Students Stomach 
Revealed By Skibo Inn Food Statistics
Incidents At Skibo Un
cover Quirks of Human 
Nature
Skibo Inn, where classroom re
straint is unfettered, is . the best 
place to obtain first hand informa
tion on the college stomach, the 
psychology of co-eds, or any other 
phase of human nature which one 
may wish to study.
Statistics 
If statistics do not lie, those on 
food consumption at Skido Inn dis
close that many peculiar foods pass 
through an average engineers, art. 
students, or Maggie Murphs stom
ach during a school day.. The sales 
of sardine sandwiches, raw liainburgs (frequently the breakfast of 
certain Art students), and peanut 
butter-and-banana sandwiches have 
been increasing by leaps and 
bounds, and may in time replace
King Hamburg, the "big shot 
among the popular sandwiches at 
Skibo. Another strange food that 
has recently become the rave at 
the Inn is the chocolate milk 
shake with chocolate flavoring, 
chocolate ice cream and chocolate 
milk.
Besides the masculine hamburg 
several other food monopolies have 
been found to be in existence at 
Skibo. The dorm boys have what 
might be called a vertical combina
tion on hotcakcs and aspirin tab
lets, one for morning and the other 
for bed-time. To offset this, the 
co-<jds have absolutely to them
selves those five-ccnt packages of 
fig bars and other cookies which 
they buy to consume in biology 
lab.
Telephone Psychology
A famous pastime among the 
brutal engineers is to pound the 
pay telephone in' the hope that 
their nickels will be returned after 
an unpleasant conversation with 
one of the opposite sex. "She 
aint worth a nickel, remarked one 
when accused of being Scotch by 
his friend.

M. A. KINLEY ganizations in this 
district. Lighting effect will ini 
crease the attractiveness of the 
room. Also conforming with an-i 
other of the new ideas, there wilU

BUREAU OFFERS 
SENIORS ADVICE
Seniors Seeking Position 
Should Exercise 
Foresight
Editor* NoteThin, and the following 
articles' of n similar nature. nr brine 
written by the Hureau of Itecommendations especially for the Senior Class In: 
preparation for next spring:, when thin 
class will be faced with the problem of 
securing positions.
Seniors in a few months will be 
facing the question, "What shall 
I do now, with my college career, 
ended, and my business career be- 
fore me? This and similar  ques
tions seniors should begin to an
swer now, according to the Bu
reau of Recommendations, so that 
by spring they will have in mind j 
certain definite objectives concern
ing the type of employment they; 
will want.
The Bureau of Recommenda
tions, in considering the lines of, 
endeavor into which seniors ca# 
direct their efforts, states thaV 
they must take cognizance of the 
times and the demand in various 
fields. They should first consider 
the various types of industry for, 
which tjieir training fits them. 
However, seniors should not be 
too narrow  in this survey, but 
should remember that their train
ing here has been broad enough 
so that they may branch out into, 
many lines. For example, the 
electrical engineer can often find 
a niche in an industry which turns 
out chemical products, or purely 
mechanical products. All lines of:' 
engineering arc more or less re-* 
latcd, and it is the ready adapta
bility of the engineer which pre
serves for him a placc in industry. 
Many industries arc now in the1' 
throes of the depression, and the 
question of recovery is unanswerable 
at present, so that this factor must' 
be taken into consideration when j 
seniors choose the field they wish' 
to enter. The seniors should not,! 
however, let this deter them from1 
thoroughly canvassing the possi-| 
bilitics in their chosen fields; then,; 
too, there may be opportunities in 
some doscly allied industry which' 
will prove valuable later.
It is one of the objects of the

AS FAR AS FOOTBALL GAMES GO, the Purduc-Carlicgic battle was one of the best offered on last Saturday's program. The Boilermakers, with their theme song written under 
the Notre Dame system, rendered an exhibition that was con
sistent with their 13-0 victory. Their timely application of the 
deceptive Notre Dame shift culminated in a sixty-yard dash for the first touchdown. This play was a perfect end run, during 
which time, each member of the Purdue eleven fulfilled his 
duties, and so the team was said to "click.The Steficn-Waddell machine played a bang-up game, and we arc all proud of the fighting spirit and aggressiveness that 
dominated the Plaid play. Captain Armentrout, who is credited 
by Georgia Techs weekly journal as carrying everything but the water bucket, led a threatening attack. Jerry OToole, sopho
more back, stopped many a Purdue ball-carrier at, the line of 
scrimmage.Carnegies hitherto weak list of substitutes wiped out any 
notion to that effect during the final period. Bevevino, at quar
ter, staged a successful drive that reached a climax when Sayles rcachcd low for a pass over the goal line.(t i;t lit >;<
OLD NOTRE DAME will come to town with many facts 
in her favor, but we arc here to believe that the South Benders 
V1-ill have to.strain every cleat to hold the Skibo squad down. 
.The Plaid gridders emerged from their recent game with just 
a few minor injuries, and this fact should weigh heavy in de
ciding whether the five thousand Irishmen or Scotchmen arc 
wrong.)i< ii<
WE LOOK WITH PRIDE upon the worthy results of our freshmen footballers. Their 6 to 0 victory not only ends the 
winning streak of the Mountaineer yearlings, but it also keeps 
the Plcbes goal line free from a touchdown thus far this sea son. Terebus continued his stellar brand of ball toting by skirt
ing the left end for the lone score in the third period.
A strong Kiski team will help the Plebcs wind up their 1931 gridiron work next Friday at Saltsburg. The prep school 
boys have been pushing the pigskin their way with a certain 
amount of ease. A deadly aerial attack enabled them to defeat the W. & J. Frosh, 24 to 6. The Plebcs shut out the Vicc-prc3i 
dents with only 13 points so the battle next Friday will tax the ability of the Skibo yearlings heavily.

SKIBOS BATTLE 
POWERFUL IRISH 
THIS SATURDAY
The day for that annual classic, 
the Carnegic-Notre Dame game, is 
again approaching. U;ilikc last year, 
when the Tartans were top-heavy 
avoritcs, the Scbcnlcy Park school 
> not given one chance in a thou
sand to win or even get a tic. Any 
sports writer giving Carnegie an 
even chance of winning would most 
likely find himself in a padded 
ccll before the day was over.
Once before, on a bleak Novem
ber Saturday in 1926 to be exact, 
an unbeatable Irish machine camc 
o Pittsburgh prepared to brush a 
woefully week Skibo clan aside 
from the path 'to the national 
championship. On that .occasion 
Irishmen were strewn about Forbes 
Field in a very blood-thirsty man 
ner, and the Rocknc men limped 
back to South Bend on the wrong 
end of a 19-0 score. The great 
Knutc never forgot that date.
Such upsets do not happen often, 
but it must be remembered that 
the Tartan victories over Notre 
Dame have always comc when the 
Scots were given the least chance 
of winning.
Notre Dame Well Balanced 
Truly, Hunk Anderson is bring
ing a great team to Pittsburgh, 
one,  in fact, that looks every bit 
as good as any Rocknc team ever 
was.

Saturday morning the Carnegie 
Tech Plcbe football team journeyed 
down to Morgantown and took 
over the previously undefeated 
freshmen eleven from the Univers
ity of West Virginia. The score 
was 6-0. The Tartan score camc 
in the third quarter when Terrebus 
skirted the left end for a touch-, 
down. Spisak got off scvwal long 
runs, but the Skibos couRl score 
only once. Carnegie clearly out
played their opponents, the ball be
ing kept continually deep in the 
Mountaineers territory.
Kiald Undefeated
Next Friday the Carnegie Plebcs 
go up to Saltsburg and encounter 
the highly touted Kiski team. 
Kiski, so far this year, has been 
playing good football. Friday they 
defeated the W. & J. Freshmen 24- 
6. In view of the fact that The 
Tartan first year men were pushed 
hard to score a 13-0 victory over 
the Prcxie9 in their first game. It 
would seem as if it were going to 
be a tough afternoon.

The varsity cross-country team 
got off on the right foot last Sat
urday, defeating a strong Geneva 
team 22*33. Captain Jess Price 
won easily in 29:17, being follow
ed across the line by Douthitt of 
Geneva. Ramsay and Schell tied 
for third place, both boys running 
a very courageous racc under ad
verse physical conditions. Allen, 
a sophorhorc, was the fourth Plaid 
man, and Stanley was fifth.
Friday afternoon the Plebcs 
also opened the season with a vic
tory, vanquishing Peabody High 
school 18-37. Burke won in the 
commendable time of 15:39. Other 
freshmen prominent in the vic
tory were Hoffman, Blair and 
Adams.
This Saturday the varsity will 
encounter one of the strongest 
teams in the tri-state district 
when they take on Westminster. 
The Titans are undefeated as yet, 
and, led by their veteran leader, 
Smalley, they expect to give Car
negie a merry chase. Incidental
ly, Westminster has already de
feated Geneva. Carnegie should 
be in better physical condition 
than they were last Saturday, but 
even with this improvement, 
Coach Halfcrty expects the tough
est kind of battle.
The freshmen will meet Schcnley High school on Wednesday.

Yes}.. th^Tower is still dark and 
what a pity. Its too'bad to let such 
a wonderful opportunity slip by of 
showing Pittsburgh what CARNEGIE 
is, and to the sky men where we are 
located. That flambeau which we 
have at our door is now dark and 
gloomy awaiting only the spark to 
ignite the noble pile of brick and 
stonewhat a ^pity. Others cry for 
such a place to show,and here we 
arc letting the opportunity slip by 
night after night, week in and week 
out, Not even a match is lit at 
night.
My curiosity about that line which 
formed on the left disclosed that it 
was not entirely a new registration 
line, but one where ' most of the 
students who attend laboratory ses
sions were clamoring to depart with 
a few more shccklcs so as to be 
fully equipped to co'ntinue ; experi
mentations and what nots in science. 
The pity is that all this could not 
have been taken care of.- when . the 
student registered. It docs seem fool
ish to make a student stand in a 
new line after the ordeal of the pre
liminary . registration the previous 
week. Why couldn't the extra "five" 
be collected with the other fee. This 
is another idea and maybe it will 
take root. Im for ideas as you sec 
so heres hopn.
The crowds at the * ook store ljavc 
grown less and less each night and 
the students seem to be getting sup
plied. The new hour arrangement 
established last year is certainly a 
good move, as it gives one a chance 
to get to the counter before classes 
begin. Supplies, it is. hoped, arc be
ing; kept up by replenishment when 
they are exhausted, and I suppose 
text books arc on the shelf when 
called for as the instructors have a 
pleasant way of making assignments 
weekly, and you arc just out of luck 
if you dont have' the text.
The lags have disappeared from 
the tagged Ivckcrs which indicate that 
the miscreants have sensed their evil 
deeds and have taken a step in the 
right direction by reporting to the 
locker assignment Y'o&m for their 
assignment. \ We. all learn some day 
cv.h'i if we 'aren't all engineers. And
Speaking of engineers it is cer
tainly. a pathetic state of affairs 
when, in order to display to the pub
lic that you know something, well, 
you just call yourself an engineer 
and presto there you arc. Engineer
ing is attached to all manner and 
types of things now-a-days. Recently
I saw a sign displayed on a building 
telling you that the painter working 
on the building was a "Painting 
Engineer,'' how horrible. Then they 
give you a masters degree in tire 
changing and doctor's degree in greas
ing, with post graduate work in oneman top raising next in the offing. 
Of course, 1 am thinking of the 
automotive industry in case you dont 
know the kind of engineering under 
discussion. There arc some sane peo
ple left however who still call a 
spade a spade anil refer to the 
' plumber as such and not a sewer 
engineer or some other high sounding 
appendix.

from the night student body 
which have not been published. 
This condition exists because of 
several reasons. The most im
portant one is lack of available 
space on our page, and the ar
ticles, while timely when they 
were written, become Useless at a 
later date. Another reason is 
that we receive anonymous con
tributions. In every case these 
latter named articles will be re
jected; the reason is obviod^. ,
We arc glad to receive news 
items, on subjects of general na
ture, and credit for work submit* 
ted will be .given where . flue, 
even though we arc not able to 
publish all of the material .as subr, 
mittcd. We arc forced, ho,\vever, 
to decline to published any poems 
as material of this type, does not 
fit in with the general .lineup ,qf. 
the paper. If, therefore, you. do 
not sec your contributions . pMbr.

but continue to send them in.. and 
eventually you will secure, space,, 
and your efforts will he . r.ccogr

t'lic fact that everyone who  has

if .the intentions were good, the 
road-commissioner in the suburbs 
of Hades' is well pleased, and, if 
they werent good intentions 
well!
However, Im fairly certain that, 
aside from the economic side of 
things, most of us appreciated the 
rest, and arc in a great position to 
make even better records than last

Change Of 
Schedule By 
Night Students
. Now that the second week of 
school is over, there comes a time
to check up on the status of the
night students schedules. Majiy 
students registered in - courses at 
registration time and afterwards 
found that the courscs did not fit 
their needs and went to other de
partments t o arrange other 
courscs-of study. In this regard, 
the Plaid wishes to stress the 
point that any change in schedule 
must be recorded at the Regis-, 
trars Office in order that it may 
becOmc ;official. If this is not
done, no crcdit will be given for
any classes attended not* on the 
original schedule or modification 
thereof. Night students are there
fore cautioned to sec that their 
change in schedule is validated at 
the Registrar's. Office.

List of Night Student 
Workers Being 
Compiled
The Night Student Council has 
received a nUtnbcr of letters from 
the night students indicating their 
desire to work on the activities 
and all those who liav.e thus in
dicated will be considered. The 
Council has also received several 
letters from students proffering 
their aid, but they have failed to 
give their addresses or the college 
they arc registered in. It is im
portant that this information be 
given so that the students can be 
placcd on the respective lists and 
information mailed to them from 
time to time.
To the former students who 
have worked in past years and 
who have not sent in their names 
as yet, this notice also applies, 
as it is important that they send 
in their names so' that they may 
be placcd on this years list. No 
notices will be sent from now on 
.to any student who has not sent 
in his name for placing on the 
list.
The inforination sent to the 
Council should contain the fol
lowingthe student's name, ad
dress, telephone number, if any, 
and college lie is registered in. 
This informatiorf should be sent 
to the Night Student Council,
Plaid Mailing List
At this time, the Plaid mailing 
list is undergoing its yearly check
up. This checkup is necessary be
cause a large number of night 
students have changed tjieir. ad
dresses since last registration time, 
because new students arc con
stantly registering and swelling 
the list, and it Is also, necessary 
to drop those students who have, 
not returned.
Wc arc experiencing some diffi
culty because some of the stu
dents failed to give complete in
formation when they registered, 
or it was hard to interpret the 
writing on the cards. The Plaid 
is being mailed out *to as many 
as we were able to reach and we 
will continue mailing new copies' 
until the list is completed, after 
which time an announcement will 
be made so that wc can start re
vising the list to correct any er
rors which may have crept in. Wc 
ask your indulgence for a. short 
time longer.

The officers of the 
lege of industries have selected 
Octobcr 31 as the date for the 
first frolic of their collcge. This 
is the First Semester Smoker 
which is held during the first 
three weeks of school. The audi
torium of the mens gymnasium 
Avill be the scene of the party as 
in . previous years. To the former 
students of Night Industries no 
introduction of this affair is neces
sary, as they know what a good 
time is in store for them. To the 
new students in Night. Industries, 
oil the campus for the first time, 
We will say that they will be 
greeted with a surprising wel
come.
As is ustial, a very fine pro* 
gram will be made for your en
tertainment. Several features have 
been secured to please all the
tastes of those attending While 
this affair is called a smoker, it 
does not necessarily follow that 
only those who smoke can attend 
and enjoy the party. Good bouts 
will be staged; a wrestling match 
will be presented; music and jo 1 - 
lification will abound. The famous 
Kiltie Band will be out in full
regalia and this always assures a 
successful affair. , A lunch will be 
served at , the conclusion of the 
festivities.
Tickets arc now being distribut
ed for the smoker and all the stu
dents in the Night' Collegc In
dustries should secure < one and 
plan to attend. A drawing for a 
door prize will take place, and 
who knows, you may be the lucky 
winner. Several have won before. 
In 'addition to the ticket of ad
mission, students should bring 
along with them their registra
tion card for identification. This 
is the yellow card you were given
a. the time you paid your regis
tration fee and folded to put in 
the little envelope. An effort is 
being made to reach all the Night 
Industries men so that they may 
have their tickets, but if you
It pays to look over the wall
The industry that succeeds today is the 
one that looks outside its own "back-yard 
for ways to make itself more valuable.
For many years, Bell System men 
have been working out ideas to increase 
the use and usefulness of the telephone. 
For example, they prepared plans for 
selling by telephone which helped an 
insurance man to increase his annual

Student Council Name Contest Blank
My suggestion for a name for Carnegies New Student 
Union is:
Name___________
School Address.
Naming the New Union
The Carnegie Tartan, in conjunction with Student Council 
and the Puppet, is announcing this week a contest to secure a 
name for the new dance hall soon to be opened in the Gymnasiu m.
The purpose of this contest is two-fold. An appropriate 
name is needed for this excellent addition to the school's facili
ties; and in securing this name it is hoped to arouse the inter
est of the student body in the successor to the present Union.
Appropriately chosen, the prize for the winning name is n 
ticket of free admission to this new hall at all day school social 
functions. Fill out the cou,p6n below and enter a suggestion now 
so that the place for ybur coming dances may bear a fitting 
name../ * * * * *
Open Minds
(Editorial Reprint)
We were speaking to a student the other day who is 
an ardent believer in. the evolution,theory. With spirited 
enthusiasm he tried to explain the reasons for his belief and 
probably succeeded to his own satisfaction. But the re*, 
markable thing about it is that this same student was de
crying the evolution theory less than a year ago just after 
he had read an anti-evolutionary book.
Now it is quite possible that with the passage of time 
(he opinions of the student may have changed as he gradu
ally acquired more and more knowledge on the subject. 
This is quite possible but the probabality is that the student 
falls into a great class-made up to a great extent of under
graduatesI he members of which arc convinced of the 
truth of everything they read. So long as a set of argu
ments appears to lit*, logical it is believed by this type of 
student although one may expect him to believe exactly the 
opposite thing after the passage of a few weeks, when he 
reads an equally logical set of arguments upholding the 
other side of the'question.
This type of student: would flatly deny that he believes 
everything lie reads. Mis actions may be attributed to an 
attempt l<> lie broad-minded. Thus in an effort to give every
thing full justice and avoid a narrow crabbed outlook he 
goes to the other extreme and believes all seemingly logical 
arguments*forgetting, meanwhile, to-compare one argument 
with another. To possess an open mind is a very laudable 
ambition but when it leads , to such apparentstupidity as 
outlined above one thinks that perhaps a narrow prejudiced 
opinion may sometimes be'better to start off with. After all 
this latter gives the student something to compare his read
ings with and he, may notify his opinions as he thinks over 
what he reads but the open mind is often very likely "to lead 
him to believe what he reads in its.entirety.* * * .:|! *
The connoissuers of the finer arts never allow any prod
uct of their creation to be presented to the public unless 
each portion of the exhibit is in perfect harmony and no 
part reveals any less precision or care than any other. It 
is most preposterous to imagine should any such artist be 
called upon to reproduce a college campus, that after hours 
of painstaking care in re-drawing the well formed buildings 
and the nicely laid out terraces and walks, he should then 
place in the most conspicuous spot a number of grotesque 
barriers of timber and pipe bound together by an obnoxious 
yellow color, all because he was in a hurry to finish the job.
It is too bad Carnegie did not have an artist for the 
task when it became necessary to design barriers restricting 
vehicular traffic on the campus. '* * * *
That other schools are sharing the same opinion, we
reproduce here a portion of an editorial appearing in the
Springfield College newspaper.
"Golf for some time has been recognized as a sport for 
people of all ages. Such games as football, lacrosse, basket
ball, and soccer, though highly valuable to young growing 
men, arc not the sports that can be carried along into later 
life. Nothing is funnier than a baseball or basketball game 
undertaken by a puffing team of fat or bald-headed men. 
On the golf links, however, the bald head and the robust 
waistline is quite in harmony, and seldom interferes with 
the efficiency of the player. There is every reason to be
lieve that golf coaching will soon be included in the list of 
required subjects in both the physical and secretarial de
partments of Springfield College.

SERIOUSLY SPEAKING
(Continued from Page One) 
to relief, and' that - is through a 
system of compulsory unemploy
ment insurance, the revenue' to be 
derived from taxation of those 
who have derived the greatest 
benefits from American industry. 
This system can be worked out 
on the basis of industrial experi
ence and actuarial science. There 
is little which is degrading in thus 
wiping, away: the fearsome specter 
of periodical want which has grip
ped American labor in the past. 
If it is costly, then it will force 
the masters of industry to plan 
their production so' that the cost 
may be a negligible one. Nor can 
we depend on voluntary industrial 
schemes of this type for those 
men who need the protection the 
most will be the last to get it.
If this is the dread dole', in 
another guise, I suggest that we 
start a campaign to polish off the 
word and scent it with social ap
proval, for it seems to be about 
the only measure that can fill the 
bill.
COUNCIL RULES
(Continued from Page One)
The recommendations of last 
year's Student Council, were adopted 
and amended into , the constitution. 
Among these provisions was one 
stating that; the treasurer of each 
Junior class automatically is to be
come  treasurer of the Senate of 
that college and one  abolishing 
plebe regulations: at Thanksgiving.
Regulating Your Expenses 
Making yourspending 
money go as far as possible 
requires careful and' sys

account will help jou. regu

mildness . . . smoothness . . . and satisfying pleasure 
when you smoke.
All right then . . . get this straight.

HESTERFIELD pays top prices ... yes, and a 
premium for the ripest, mellowest, sweetesttasting leaf that grows.
The curing and conditioning is done by special
ists . . . men carefully trained in handling these 
fine tobaccos.   
I
N BLENDING, also, Chesterfields are different 
. . . Instead of merely mixing the tobaccos 
together . . . we cross-blend them. Its like mak
ing a new and better-tasting kind of tobacco.
Thats how we get that Chesterfieldflavor. Milder 
. . . and a more pleasing aroma.
Cigarette paper? Only the purest thats made 
is good enough for Chesterfield.
P
ICK UP a package. Note its clean appearance . . . free 
from heavy inks. Its moisture-proof, too.
And three big factories at Richmond, Durham and San 
Franciscooperating under the strictest sanitary standards 
rush them fresh to you.
Good ... theyve got to he good. Be
cause theyre made that way. And 
most important of all . . . you can 
taste this goodness in the cigarette. 
You can tell it in the smoke.
Light up, Mister! Try Chesterfield. 
Let the cigarette do its own talking. 
Youll get the whole thrilling story, 
in just two words . . ."They Satisfy!
What a Trip!
Three Carnegie lasses set out on a daring ex
cursion last Saturday night. Hopping an excur
sion train late Saturday they endured the hor
rors of a day coach at ijight and early Sunday 
emerged from the train into the city across the 
river from Windsor, Canada, more or less 
bedraggled for their harrownig experience. Sun
day was spent dabbling in sorority business and 
some of the 
sisters. Sun

Grace Borgcrding went thru hell and high water 
for dear old Alpha Chi. Oh, yes, it was loads 
of fun but 'not to be repealed every wCck-cnd.
Those Bachelors Again!
The Bachelor's Club held its last . regular 
meeting at the Pep dance last Friday. The 
members' guests protested to no avail so were 
deserted' while-the boys had their get-together 
at the band stand. The only rule thoroughly 
agreed on.was that if a member was so rash 
as to give away a pin or any simliar token lie 
must treat the Club to a square meal. There 
wass .violent disscntion in the ranks over the 
matter of frequency with which a member could 
date any one girl; Some said no oftcner than 
once a year. . Others said no oftener than once 
a day. - The penalty for infraction of this last 
mentioned "rule is to pass out ceegars. (Well, 
it might be worth 30 cents in some cases). They 
have a .secret grip, tod!

Well, Well!
One day last week a bunch of the Heat and 
Vents were snoopin around1 the basement of a 
high school investigating this and that. A' Sump 
(a low reservior in which drainage and waste 
water collects) had collected a/ coat of cement 
dust on its surface and resembled perfectly 
sound concrete to the casual observer. Bill 
Gesling, observing only casually, trocl on the 
above mentioned sump and as he possessed no 
supernatural powers over natural laws lie sank 
his deep in the liquid. Imagine his surprise. He 
had forgotten his waterwings! ... A band of 
Freshmen set out one fine evening looking for 
Sophs ;andtrouble. Finally they encountered a 
lone bold ^second year man who; in order to 
show his contempt for Plebes, spat vorciferously. 
The spat was quite vorcifcrous enough but care
lessly aimed and landed on one of the -Fresh
men. ,Tl\at was thfe last straw so only after the 
bad Soph had been torn limb from limb did the 
little band turn homeward, and go to bed happy
