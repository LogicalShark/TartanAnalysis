First Difficult Contest of the Year. 
Large Crowd Will Make 
the Trip.
On to Case should be the watch
word of every Tech man this week. 
Whether unable to make the trip or 
not, it should be talked up until no 
one has any doubts as to what is 
expccted of every student. The only 
reason worth while for remaining at 
home should be absolute destitution, 
or the necessity of holding down a 
job on next Saturday.
The game should be so close as to 
make the viewing of it a pleasant 
anticipation. Except for Pitt, Case 
will be the strongest team that Tech 
will meet on the gridiron this fall. 
It will be interesting to see for the 
first time just what our eleven will 
be able to accomplish in the way of 
attack and defense against a really 
good team, and will furnish the first 
chance that we have to estimate the 
game that our team will play against 
Pitt the following Saturday.
The Case School of Applied Sci
ence registers about eight hundred 
students in engineering courses, and 
rlways places strong teams on the 
field. This year they have held the 
University of Michigan to a 14-3 
rcore, won from Oberlin for the first 
time in five years, 14-2, and last Sat
urday defeated Mount Union, 19-0. 
This years team is the strongest that 
has represented the school in many 
seasons and is featured by a very 
heavy line, somewhat outweighing 
our own, and a heavy and plunging 
backfield. It will be seen that Coach 
Steffen and the team have their work 
cut out for them.
Announcement as to the exact time 
of departure of the special cars com
ing and goinsr will be made on the 
bulletin boards this week. Round trip 
tickets are now on sale at Bursar' 
office. Every one should wear arm 
bands if possible. Megaphones will 
be sold on the cars at five cents per.

TE(H EASILY DEFEATS HIRAM, 467
VISITORS ARC PLUCKY AND UNCORK SURPRISE
Before a rather small crowd Hiram 
was added to the Plaids list of de
feated foes on Saturday. End runs 
proved to be the most effective me
thod of attack and aided by clever inat will, with Finlay and Marshall to 
at will, with Finlay and Marshal to 
duplicate his feat when their turn 
came. The line was unable for some 
time to solve the individual attack of 
Peterman and Roberts of the visi
tors, who far outclassed their team 
mates in all departments of the game, 
and in the second quarter made five 
first downs in succession, covering 
almost sixty yards. Williams, who 
replaced Young at right guard, who 
in turn was playing for Fletcherout 
on account of injuriessolved the at
tack of these men and aided by Kelly 
and Hellstrom held the visitors at a 
crucial moment. The trick was turn
ed by breaking through to the back
field before the play was well under 
way, for once it was started the sec
ondary defense was all that could 
stop it.
Whats the Trouble.
Yes, whats the trouble? Perhaps 
it is because Fletcher was out of the 
line-up, but that is hard to tell. The 
idea iswell have to find a way to 
stop a good plunging back-field and 
then weve got em. Perhaps the 
mid-season slump was on the job.We 
hope so and now almost believe so 
and are glad it is over now instead 
of later in the season.
Gibson Does Well.
Gibson replaced Levy early in the 
game and showed unexpected fight
and speed, bring down his man every 
time, even at times when it looked 
as though he had lost him and many 
an other end would have given him 
up. While he still seems a little weak 
in interference we can add his name 
to the list of the exponents of the 
old pep and are assured that we 
have a most reliable substitute for the 
end station.
Little Open Play.
Only a few attempts at forward 
passes mark the offense of our wariors and we are eagerly waiting for 
the launching of an aerial attack on 
the formidable enemies in our imme
diate presence. In straight offensive 
tactics we have every requirement 
and are well equipped to meet any 
opponent in this departmentno lit
tle feature, by the waybut the mod
ern game makes other demands and 
we know they are going to be fulfill
ed and the fun will be seeing how it 
is cone.
Kesner and Aultdoerffer Injured.
These two stars were forced to re
tire from the imbroglio and the spec
tators were much interested to know 
the extent of their injuries. Were 
glad to say that they will both re
turn to the game shortly, at least in 
time for Pitt. Aultdoerffer received 
his injuries while running back a kickoff for thirty yards, showing hitherto 
unknown speed and open-field work. 
Sonny had his ankle twisted after 
making a long run around left end

A perfect afternoon and evening 
at Carnegie Tech were the words of 
the president of the D. A. R. ladies 
who visited Margaret Morrison and 
Design Schools last Wednesday. Dean 
Breed spoke about Margaret Morri

among womankind, and Director 
Ilamerschlag delivered a short interContinued on Page 4
The C. I. T. Economic Society is 
happy to announce to the students 
of the Carnegie Institute of Tech
nology that on Monday, November 
8th, John Spargo will lecture under 
its auspices on the subject of The 
Real Meaning of Socialism.
John Spargo is undoubtedly the 
greatest authority on this subject in 
the United States. He is recognized 
by every one as one of the greatest 
sociologists and economists in the 
world. His books are used as text 
books in many universities, so great 
is his esteem even by the non-Socialist professors.

DEATH OF MR. FREW 
FRIEND OF TECH
Was Earnest Worker for Tech. 
Staunch Friend of Mr. Carnegie.
At their meeting in Dean Leetes 
office last Friday evening at 7:30 the 
1915-16 Student Activities Board 
chose their officers. W. Espy, presi
dent; C. F. Peters, vice president; F. 
A. Berner, secretary; and A. W. 
Swanson, who was elected last year 
from the Sophomore Science class to 
act as treasurer for three years, make 
up the present official staff.
M. B. Garber, a Design man, was 
chosen advertising manager. This is 
a salaried position to which the Stu
dent Activities elects a man each year.

Ex-President of Board of Trustees.
The sad event of the death of Mr. 
William N. Frew, which occurred last 
week, marked the passing away of 
one of the most earnest workers in 
the promotion of Tech.
In the death of William N. Frew 
Pittsburgh loses another of its wellknown residents and one who for 
many years has been the active repre
sentative here of Andrew Carnegie 
as that gentlemans activities were 
manifested in public benefactions. 
Since the establishment of the Car
negie Institute Mr. Frew devoted 
nearly all his time to the ironmasters 
Pittsburgh generosities. He was, un
til the appearance of the illness that 
eventually caused his death, always 
prominently identified in an official 
capacity with the Institute, the hero 
fund, the technical school, the teach
ers fund and other Carnegie enter
prises. In the business and social 
life of Pittsburgh he took an active 
part, having been on the directorate 
of several banking institutions, was 
a trustee of the Pennsylvania College 
for Women and a member of different 
clubs.
It was in the early years of the Car
negie enterprises that Mr. Frews 
services were most needed. Then the 
undertakings demanded the attention 
of someone of keen judgment, artistic 
appreciation and unselfish interest to 
insure their success. These and other 
qualities Mr. Frew gave and he had 
the satisfaction of seeing all the splen
did affairs take on a firmness that 
means permanency.
The death of Mr. Frew was not un
expected. After the inception of the 
illness he was compelled to give up, 
in March, 1914, many of his interests 
in public life. He was a prominent 
figure at the Allegheny county bar 
and a patron of art.
President Church of the Carnegie 
Institute board of trustees when told 
of Mr. Frews death, said:
In every position he occupied his 
advice and example were of ines
timable worth. Pittsburgh has lost a 
great man in his death.
GUILD DANCE BIG SUCCESS.
The first school dance of the year 
was held under the auspices of the 
Guild, Friday night in Recreation 
Hall. It was a Halloween Dance and

ON TO CASE.
This is your last chance to remove 
that doubt as to whether you are go
ing to Cleveland Saturday. It is not 
necessary to say much in regard to 
the trip as every one knows the ar
rangements. In case you do not, ask 
your neighbor or read the bulletin 
board. There are quite a number of 
students who have expressed their 
desire to go to Case and we need 
many moreso sign up.
It is the duty of every student to 
his Alma Mater to be present at Case, 
also it is to your advantage to take 
the trip. You shall see parts of our 
country which you may not have seen 
otherwise. Cleveland is a beautiful 
city and well worth visiting.
Again the confidence which loyal 
rooting and cheering puts into the 
team on the gridiron is assuring vic
tory to say the least. You owe it to 
our team which is one of the best that 
has ever represented the school.
We should have at least five hun
dred men in line at Cleveland for our 
parade. We must show Case and the 
Clevelandites that Carnegie Tech is 
on the map with a big dot. It is your 
duty to your school, your team and 
lastly to your own advantage to make 
this memorable trip. We feel assured 
that all of the above number of loyal
Techites will be present in our rush 
for victory on the enemys field. On 
to Case, November 6.
AN ASSEMBLY.
The suggestion as to a general as
sembly has been revived again among 
the student body. At a recent club 
meeting the matter was again brought 
up. It seems as though the sugges
tion is well worthy of due considera
tion on part of every student and 
every member of the faculties.
Each of the four schools of our in
stitution have their weekly assem
blies. We are in reality four distinct 
and separate parts of an institution 
which should be a whole on many 
occasions,only brought together on 
Founders Day, at some athletic 
contests and once in a while on an 
outing. We lack the necessary co
operation for a successful institution. 
Our present mode and means of get
ting together are insufficient as any 
one may see.
As has been suggested, why not 
have an assembly for entire institu
tion? One hour a week devoted to 
general school discussions and lec
tures would derive benefits untold. 
It is true we lack the proper place at 
present on the campus, but we have 
Carnegie Music Hall and Carnegie 
Lecture Hall at our disposal. As to 
attendanceeach class may be re
sponsible for the attendance of its 
membersand in like manner have 
special seating arrangements to do 
away with all unnecessary confusion. 
The faculties may allot one credit to 
a reasonable attendance if deemed fit.
We can say that Carnegie is the 
only school that does not have a 
weekly, let alone daily assembly of 
the entire institution. It can be made 
the most looked for hour of the 
weekspeeches from our faculties, 
coaches, and timely speakers of the 
day, will tend to inspire and develop 
a true and stronger Carnegie Spirit.
The Tartan suggests that the sug
gestion above be carefully considered 
by the administration. We voice the 
desire of the entire student body. It 
will give a chance to see better what 
each department is doing and the body 
as a whole. It is a movement worthy 
of support from every one in Car
negie.
RADIO CLUBS CASE GAME 
BULLETIN SERVICE.
The Radio Club announces that ar
rangements have been made with the 
Cleveland Marconi Station to send 
the score of the Case game by quar
ters. This will be posted on the 
campus, and at Millers Stationery 
Store in Oakland.
This Student Activity has complet
ed half of the work on their powerful 
M. G. sending set, and the work is 
progressing favorably. Notices on the 
bulletin boards tell the students who 
are interested where and when to 
work on this equipment. It is espe
cially desired that students not going 
to Case put in some time on the set 
Saturday, which they can do at the 
same time they are receiving the re
sults. See Mr. Van Dyke in regard 
to this.
Several new members have recently 
been added to the club, but more are 
wanted, so let everybody interested 
be sure of a welcome at the next regu
lar meeting on Thursday, November
11, at 7:30 P. M. in the Machinery 
Hall Tower Room.
IMPRESSIONS OF INSPECTION 
NIGHT.
A Tour Taken a Year Ago Last May 
Where the Old Beanery Was 
Standing.
One night each year it set aside by 
the Tech authorities for the general 
inspection of the schools by the pub
lic. All the work of the students is 
exhibited, and the shops and labora
tories are shown in operation.
Commencing with the Industry 
Building, we again see our friend 
Taylor, making as much noise as pos
sible with the air hammer. Dosey 
juggling moulds; Pfouts, convincing 
the general public that Pattern Mak
ing is the only trade in which edu
cated people work. We are taken 
through the Machine Shop and 
Daddy tells another one of his 
jokes. Then we rapidly survey the 
Electrical Wiring, the Manual Train
ing, and the Sheet Metal Shops and 
are carried by the crowd to Machin
ery Hall.
We pass the Deans office in a hurry 
and pause to inspect the power plant 
and the Electric Labs. We climb 
many flights of stairs, and then some 
more. Passing through a door, we 
stand on the parapet and gaze at the 
beautiful scenery belowthe B. & O. 
R. R. More stairs to climb and we 
peer over the railing into the semi
darkness below, while our guide 
points out that famous buildingthe 
Beanery.
Next, we visit the Science School. 
Tonight, all classes are permitted to 
ride in the elevators, and every one is 
making the best of the opportunity. 
We visit the Chemical laboratory, and 
are entertained by two aspiring chem
ists, deeply engrossed in manufactur
ing fireworks which fail to go off. 
We visit the Physics Lab., and are 
delighted to find some other individ
uals working over the Box Bridge, 
which was our Waterloo. We are 
shown the Chemical Lecture room, 
but the Physics lecture room is 
avoided. I wonder why? We visit 
the Sanitary Engineering lab., and 
look through the microscope at the 
GermansI mean germs. Then we 
are off to the Design Building.
We pause to lament that the De
sign theater has no gallery. The Art 
Exhibit next draws our attention. Up 
some more stairs and we are in the 
studios. We discover a model of 
Julius Caesar, smoking a stogie, and 
we speculate on the age of that stogie.
We are awakened from our reverie 
as we enter the Margaret Morrison 
building. Naturally, we first visit the 
Housekeeping Department and par
take of some foods without any ap
parent injury. Somehow or other, the 
macaroni tastes different from the
macaroni at the Beanery, probably 
because it is real macaroni. We visit 
the sewing room acting as though we 
understood the difference between cal
ico and percale. In the Household 
lab., we talk about the Bacteriological 
Fixation of Nitrogen, and the young 
ladies across the aisle are amazed. We 
glance at the library and then return 
to the Industry Building where we 
see Dr. Hower perform experiments 
with great rapidityin moving pic
tures.

CARNEGIE TECH Y. M. C. A. 
ORGANIZED.
What promises to be an epocn-making occurrence in the history of Tech 
took place last Sunday afternoon 
when a band of fellows, thirty in 
number, met to organizea Y. M. C. A. 
for Carnegie Tech. Although small 
in number the attendance at the 
meeting was very encouraging, in
deed, for enthusiasm as to the organ
izing of such an association and a 
realization of its need here, reigned 
supreme. A keen earnestness was 
displayed by all of those present and 
the views for the success of such an 
undertaking were very promising.
During the course of the meeting, 
chairman J. P. Warner called, in turn, 
on every man present to express his 
views on the founding of a Y. M. C. 
A. at Tech. In this way the question 
was thoroughly discussed and every 
phase of the subject was treated upon.
Perhaps the most important and the 
greatest need of a Y. M. C. A. here 
is to supply the want of a re
ligious body. Many fellows in 
coming here have noticed and 
wondered at the lack of a religious 
association of any kind. It is true 
that we are well prepared in mind, as 
far as studies are concerned, and in 
body. But it is not altogether fitting 
and right that we go on without any 
religious influence. At almost all other 
colleges the Y. M. C. A. plays a most 
important part. At Penn State, for 
instance, there are twelve hundred 
members of the Y. M. C. A. In every 
case the Y. M. C. A. has proven itself 
an excellent character builder.
Not only does the Y. M. C. A. serve 
religiously but also socially it will 
be a great advantage to Tech. In the 
Y. M. C. A. meetings fraternity and 
non-fraternity men meet on an equal 
social basis. This something which 
perhaps might not take place without 
a Y. M. C. A. Nor does such an Asso
ciation hold for any one Christian 
faith alone. Protestants, Catholics, or 
the members of any other Christian 
religion have exactly the same rights 
in the Y, M. C. A. Here the fellows 
may get together and talk things over; 
topics of the day or anything they 
desire. By this method of getting to
gether and discussing things an ex
cellent college spirit is aroused.
The Y. M. C. A. has come to Tech 
and is going to stay. The question is 
are you going to come out and join 
the Y. M. C. A. and help in this mat
ter to better both Carnegie Tech 
and yourself? Every Tech man 
should come to the next meeting on 
November 14th. The place of meeting 
has not yet been decided upon but 
will be announced in due time. Every 
one who can should be there.
J. P. Warner was fittingly elected 
temporary chairman until the election 
of permanent officers. He was instru
mental in the founding of the associa
tion. A committee was then (jhosen 
consisting of a man from each school 
and one faculty member. This com
mittee is to find out the most suitable 
method for placing the Tech Y. M. C. 
A. more firmly on its feet.
MR. HAROLD BAUER MAKES 
IMPROMPTU VISIT.
Loud in Praise of Design School.
The term impromptu is used ad
visedly in behalf of Mr. Bauer, who 
avoids music schools and things of 
like nature when aware of their prox
imitybut (with all the guilelessness 
of genius) follows where he is led.
The company with Mr. W. C. Ham
ilton of the music house of that 
that name, he was walking through 
the park when they quite unexpect
edly (?) came upon the campus. Im
mediately he expressed his interest 
in the group of buildings, especially 
the one under construction before 
the portals of which they found them
selves. On being informed that it 
was Pittsburghs School of Art, he 
manifested his surprise in finding 
such an expression of the artistic 
impulcse in this city, and under the 
guidance of Secretary Bossange, en
tered on a tour of the building and 
a consideration of its resources with 
zest. The theater came in for no 
small share of his attention and ad
miration. Naturally he drifted into 
the domain of Mr. J. Vick OBrien, 
where he made many inquiries as to 
the courses being pursued there, the 
equipment, its aims, etc.
His surprise at the nominal cost of 
tuition and the advantages offered 
was as unbounded as his enthusiasm 
over the fact that America was now 
offering greater opportunity than Eu
rope to music students. He express
ed himself as believing that the time 
had arrived when it was no longer 
essential for the student to seek 
abroad for instruction and inspira
tion; that nowhere else in the world 
perhapswas the whole area of Art 
so completely covered by one roof 
as right here in the School of Ap
plied Design.
Of course no person of intelligence 
and understanding believes him to 
mean that at this present moment 
this school has reached the zenith of 
its possibilitiesthe handicaps, the 
incompleteness (especially in this de
partment) are too evidentbut he 
does mean that out of the present 
chaos is to spring an institution, the 
completeness of which as a home and 
fountain-head of all the Arts, has 
never been surpassed, if equaled.
Laterdining with members of the 
faculty, when Mr. OBrien expressed 
his regret over the fa^r that the highprice of seats debarred many students 
from the privilege of hearing the 
great artists, he said that he too re
gretted this fact and would be one 
of the first to give probe (matinee 
rehearsals at a nominal cost but that 
the canons of the cult forbade it; 
he would be considered an outlaw by 
his fellow-artists.
Noblesse obligeso are the gener
ous impulses of the great smothered, 
even in their birth.
He expressed the hope that he 
might again visit the school on his 
return to this city in January and 
paid his hosts the delicate compli
ment of suggesting that they assist 
in the arrangement of the programme 
to be given on that occasion.
The School of Applied Design is
duly grateful to Mr. W. C. Hamilton 
for beguiling a man of Mr. Bauers 
appreciative enthusiasm into its cor
ridors.

REMBLER FIRST ASSISTANT 
TRACK MANAGER. 
First Assistant Baseball Manager 
Tabled. Graduate Manager. 
Discussed.
The principal business cleared up 
by the Board of Control at their meet
ing last Wednesday evening in the 
Science Study Room was the election 
of William L. Rembler, Science Jun
ior, as first assistant track manager.
The choice of the first assistant 
manager for baseball was delayed un
til Tyler, this years manager, could 
give his recommendation at the next 
meeting. Among those who went out 
regularly for the job are Bogardus, 
Hellstrom, Kennedy and Walker.
A committee was appointed to con
fer with the Student Activities Board 
in reference to the appointment of the 
position of graduate manager.

D. A. R. ENTERTAINED.
During the recent state convention 
of the Daughters of the American 
Revolution, the Pittsburgh Chapter 
entertained the visiting chapters at a 
buffet supper in the Margaret Morri
son School Building last Wednesday. 
The guests arrived in the afternoon 
and were shown through the building 
which was, at the same time, interest
ing and novel to most of the mem
bers.
Supper was served in the Recrea
tion Hall which was most artistically 
decorated with palms, ferns and 
potted flowering plants. After supper 
the members of the convention were 
the guests of the Dramatic students at 
a play given by them in the Design 
School Theater.
ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION 
MEETING.
At a meeting of the Athletic Asso
ciation, at which very few girls were 
present, several plans for creating in
terest in athletics were considered. 
Although the girls are very busy it 
would seem that some time could 
be taken for basketball and other 
sports. The boys work just as hard 
as we do, yet consider what they ac
complish in that line. A game be
tween Faculty and students is being 
arranged for with a dance afterwards. 
Practice will of course be necessary 
before a project can be successfully 
engineered. Girls are therefore urged 
to come to meetings and to practice 
when such things are posted. Later 
in the year, a cotillion dance is being 
planned, an event which is one that 
will be very popular with the girls.GUILD DANCE
Continued from Page 1 
the decorations were in keeping with 
the name. Lighted pumpkin faces 
were scattered through the room, 
resting on the window sills and shad
ing the electric globes. Corn shocks 
banked the piano with red apples 
gleaming from between the stalks. 
Suspended from the ceiling through
out the room hung rosy apples on dif
ferent lengthed strings which added 
greatly to the pleasures of dancing, 
as they made convenient missiles with 
which to bombard the approaching 
foe (?). The refreshments served 
were cider and doughnuts.
The programs were quite attractive 
and original, having Guild Dance 
hand painted on the front cover with 
a witch flying through the air on a 
broom-stick in silhouette immediately 
below. Mrs. Helen Carpenter added 
greatly to the enjoyment of the guests 
by telling fortunes in one corner of 
the room, and judging from the length 
of time each inquirer after knowledge 
remained, many wonderful things 
must have been expounded. The 
Guild appreciates the kindness of Mrs. 
Carpenter in coming and wishes to 
thank her for her services given.
About 35 or 40 couples were pres
ent. This was not nearly enough as a
representation from the school. It 
seems strange that girls do not take 
more interest in the social affairs of 
the school. Being an a Friday night, 
announced at least a month before 
the date, and having the proceeds for 
charitythere seems to be no possible 
excuse for more girls not coming. As 
for those that did come, we know by 
the general remarks and happy ex
pressions on all the faces that they 
did have a wonderfully good time. 
The Guild wishes to thank Miss Shu
man and Miss Hopkins for acting as 
chaperones.
The success of the evening was due 
principally to Miss Maude Sanford, 
president, and Miss Christine Cam
eron, chairman of the committee on 
general arrangements. The commit
tees on programs and decoration de
sire special mention for the good taste 
and originality they displayed in car
rying out their duties.TECH ENTERTAINS D. A. R.

esting address. The visitors were then 
taken to the different departments in 
M. M. C. S. and at six Mrs. Packer 
served them to lunch in the faculty 
reception rooms.
In the evening at 8:30, the ladies 
and their friends were entertained at 
Design by dramatic students, who pre
sented the playlet "Glory of the 
Morning.
Happiness will not stay forever 
with the Indian who marries the white 
man was the theme of the playlet. 
The Winnebago Indian squaw Glory 
of the Morning, after a faithful and 
loving servitude of IS years, comes 
to the realization that her French 
husband will not need her in France, 
the country beyond the great sea
water, whither he has been called. 
But the proud and beautiful squawwife holds back the tears which come 
from weary waiting, the joy of pos
sessing and the pain of parting, and 
bids him good-bye.
Her young pretty care-free daugh
ter, Red Wing, chooses to go with 
her father; but the son, more proud 
of his Indian blood, refuses to leave 
and remains with his mother to hunt 
the grey squirrel as his ancestors did. 
And Black Wolf, the wise old medi
cine man, bewails the dying splendor 
of the once great Winnebago, and the 
destructive influence of the faithless 
paleface.
Half Moon, the husband, leaves for 
France, with his daughter, answering 
the call of his race and king; leaving 
Glory of the Morning desolate, 
bending over the dying embers of the 
fire she had built for him.
The setting was a very beautiful 
one, a corner of Canadian woods 
bathed in autumn sunset.
Miss Ramseys interpretation of the 
role of Glory of the Morning, was 
very appealing and drew the sympathy 
of her entire audience.
Although the theme was a sad one, 
the audience seemed genuinely pleased 
with the production. On all sides 
favorable comments were heard and 
Mrs. William D. Hamilton, president 
of the Twentieth Century Club, said,
I wish I could express how happy
you have made us ladies feel and how 
delightfully you have entertained. 
Truly the Daughters of the American 
Revolution will not soon forget Car
negie Tech.
THE MASQUE IN DETAIL.
Theodore A. Viehman and Howard 
S. Smith now have the minor depart
ments of the masque, which is to pre
cede the ball of November 10, crystalized.
The first step in the scheme of ac
tion is to take place in the ornate 
throne-room, where Charlemagne 
leads his officers of state, favorites, 
heralds and courtiers to the royal 
chair and directs his seneschal, Eginhart, to deliver the welcoming speech 
and declare time of revelry and re
joicing as an aftermath of their suc
cess on the recent African wars.
Following this opening ovation the 
court members prepare to receive the 
numerous oriental convoys and royal 
cliques awaiting the emperors pleas
ure.
Turpin, an archbishop, enters, and 
is welcomed by Eginhart amid the 
whang of trumpets, the richness of 
royal state, and the frankincence hov
ering about the royal chamber. He 
is directly followed by Leo, ambas
sador from the Emperor of Byzan
tine, who gives felicitations of new 
success in wars against the Moslems.
Again a group of trumpets blast 
their notes through the hall and Namo, of Bavaria, and oldest of the 
Paladins, enters with Rinaldo and 
states the behavior of the Paladins 
in battle. At this time acute inter
est is infused into the unapparent 
plot by the request of Rinaldo that 
he be relieved of the attentions of a 
lover. These men are immediately 
followed by Didier, the Popes am
bassador.
An enormous thunder from the 
trumpet carriers ushers in the main 
composition of the emperors army, 
which is followed by Charlemagnes 
general favorite, Ogier, the Dane.
A roll of music and a shower of 
flowers brings Roland, the most noted 
of the Paladins forth to speak boastingly of his deeds in recent combat. 
Among this composite group we find 
the enchanter Malagigi, Sobrino, a 
captive Saracen, Rogers, a former 
Moor, and a personage of wonderful 
beauty, Bradmante, the warrier mai
den. The rear guard now enters and 
a quarrel is quickly pacified by Egin
hart. Fantastic dances follow and 
when the Emperor has been show
ered with gifts the banquet is an
nounced. During the feast of plenty 
court fools, enchanters, prophets, and 
comedians play for the guests pleas
ure, and when the feast is over the 
assemblage again retires to the 
throne room where the captive Sob
rino is made the center of a wild, 
sordid dance by the Paladins. His 
life is spared only upon the condi
tion that he execute a similar dance. 
His acting and dance which follow, 
will prove to be a mark of intense in
terest.
He dances, and Charlemagne de
clares:
The halls open to greet the wan
ing stars with rythmic feet.

ELECTRICIANS INSPECT CONSTRUCTION WORK.
With W. H. Harold, of the Build
ing Bureau as a competent and cour
teous guide the members of the Up
per and Middle Classes in Equip
ment and Installation rambled 
through the Design School Friday 
afternoon, October 29th. From the 
dark and damp mysteries of tunnel 
and basement to the giddy heights 
of the last bit of scaffolding, we 
trailed after Mr. Harold, better 
known as Scotty, who kept up a 
running fire of comment on every
thing from the most hifalutin tradi
tions of art and architecture to the 
latest invention in wall ties and con
crete reinforcement.
It was a real travellogue, for we 
got our lecture as we traveled, and 
believe me, we traveled some. Any
one who saw our dusty clothes and 
shoes would think we had tramped 
from McKees Rocks, but it was 
worth while, and we hope that a 
good portion of the knowledge of 
building construction gained will 
stick long enough to be put into real 
service. Messrs. Calderwood, Dodds 
and Mayo were with us and explain
ed the interesting features of the 
electric wiring.
Of course we explored the theater, 
both before and behind the curtain; 
in fact, we missed nothing but the 
actors and actorines. Scotty showed 
up great as a stage electrician, for 
when he couldnt find the switch to 
throw on the blue lights, he just 
opened the safety valve instead and 
made the air blue. Get it?
R. E. Porter.
At the annual meeting of the Na
tional Safety Council, held in Phila
delphia on October 19th, Dean Connelley was appointed to the director
ate of the Council.
The Night Mechanical Draftsmens 
Club held a get-together meeting 
last Thursday evening. Mr. F. J. 
Hartman spoke to the men on The 
Significance of a Student Organiza
tion. The officers will be elected at 
the next meeting. This organization 
is the oldest in the Industries School.
The Emanon Club, which was 
founded last year, has been officially 
recognized by the Students Activities 
Board. It is at present composed of 
Industries men, but is open, by invita
tion, to the men of all the schools.
The Plebe class held a meeting last 
Thursday afternoon. A call was made 
for a man to report for second assist
ant track manager. Jone, Ginocchio 
and McVey were appointed to collect 
the club room dues. The Plebe class 
expects to send a large delegation to 
the Case game at Cleveland.
ACTIVITIES ELECT OFFICERS
Continued from Page 1 
In addition the manager receives a 
commission on every advertisement 
obtained for the schools publications.
The idea back of the position is that 
the managerial staffs of school pub
lications such as the Thistle, the ath
letic programs, and others need not 
bother about securing the advertise
ments necessary to financing the pub
lications. Also the advertisers have a 
much better feeling toward the 
schools if they are not approached 
from so many different sources.
A committee of three from the 
Board of Athletic Control consisting 
of Alan Bright, C. L. Eaton, and W. 
P. Lippincott met with the Student 
Activities to consider electing a grad
uate manager. Nothing definite re
sulted, although the general sentiment 
of both boards is in favor of a full
time man, paid by the two boards 
jointly; and for this position Gear
hart appeared to be the logical man, 
although the position is open to any 
alumnus, and for this reason some of 
the members wished the action de
layed until more alumni would apply.
Appropriation was made to send 
thirty student members and the di
rector of the band to Case next Satur
day, and a further grant of ten new 
uniforms, making the total number 
thirty-six was given.
New members of the board are: 
E. Baker, Science; C. F. Steen, De
sign.
CROSS-COUNTRY TRIALS.
On Friday, November 5th, the trials 
will be held for entries for the A. A. 
U. Middle Atlantic Championship 
Meet on November 13th. The A. A. 
U. Meet will be a hard one and for 
this reason a hard course through the 
park has been picked for the trials 
and a good race may be expected. The 
distance to be traversed is a little over 
five miles. The following men have 
shown up particularly well and de
serve considerable credit for the work 
they have done. They are: Lawson, 
Howe, Walker, Moore, Dockstader, 
Rieser, and Andrews. The first eight 
men to finish will probably be en
tered in the A. A. U. Meet. In this 
meet eight enter and five place. Last 
years trials were won by Rieser, while 
the year before Hazelton carried away 
the honors. The race will begin on 
Friday at 5:00 oclock. Men are need
ed to act as checkers for the course 
and all desiring to do this will please 
report.
BOXING AND FENCING 
CLASSES.
Instruction in Boxing and Fencing 
has been included in the curriculum 
of the Department of Physical Edu
cation. Classes will begin Novem
ber 8th, 1915. Sophomores, Juniors 
and Seniors are eligible.
Mr. J. Choynski will teach Box
ing, three hours per week.
Mr. Geo. W. Postgate will teach 
Fencing three hours per week.
For full particulars and enrollment 
in either class, see Mr. McCulloch at 
the Gymnasium during the present 
week.

NEW YORK STATE CLUB.
On Tuesday, October 26, 1915, the 
New York State Club held its initial 
meeting. Plans were laid for a 
smoker to be held shortly after 
Thanksgiving and the following men 
elected to look after the details, Cur
tis, Morley, Green, Triesky.
CARNEGIE INSTITUTE OF 
TECHNOLOGY ECON
OMIC SOCIETY.
The Carnegie Institute of Technol
ogy finished its first year as a member 
of the Intercollegiate Socialist Society 
at the close of the school year in 
June. The society, which consists of 
students of the Institute, had a mem
bership of twenty-three men and 
women, all the schools being repre
sented. Its work has consisted of a 
liberal study of economic questions. 
This has been done by securing some 
of the best speakers in the country on 
the subjects taken up. In this way 
the members were able to secure in
formation from teachers most quali
fied to give it. Besides, the members 
of the society prepared papers on 
economic questions, which were read 
at the regular meetings.
Among the various speakers who 
appeared before the society the fol
lowing should be mentioned. At the 
large public meeting held at the Car
negie Lecture Hall in the interest of 
peace, addresses were made by Dr. 
Willet, of the Carnegie Institute of 
Technology; Dr. Levy, the well known 
Pittsburgh Rabbi; Chancellor McCor
mack, of the University of Pittsburgh; 
and Dr. Acheson, of the Pennsylvania 
College for Women. At this meeting 
an anti-military resolution was adopt
ed by those present. At another meet
ing held at the school theater the 
members were given a stirring address 
by the noted Socialist speaker, Rose 
Pastor Stokes, who spoke on What 
the Socialists Want. Another im
portant meeting was the one where 
John W. Slayton spoke on Practical 
Socialism. Mrs. Florence Kelly, 
Vice President of the Intercollegiate 
Socialist Society, gave an interesting 
talk on child labor at another meet
ing. The last speaker, one who is 
well known by all women, was the 
eloquent Mrs. Gertrude Bleslau Fuller, 
who spoke on Woman and Social 
Progress.
This array of good speakers helped 
this year the membership of the sogreatly in arousing the interest of the 
student body, and it is expected that 
ciety will be greatly increased.

Design School Notes
A THOUSAND-MILE WALK.
Original Idea of Design Students.
Last week a notice was posted in 
the corridors of the Design Building, 
requesting that all students attend the 
Thousand-Mile Walk, on Tuesday 
at 4:30 P. M. This notice incited not 
a little wonder and even a little worry, 
especially among the Plebes, as to 
what it meant and how far they really 
would have to walk. However those 
that knew informed those that did 
not. And this was what happened:
All students were lined up into two 
lines, one composed of men, the other 
composed of girls. At a signal the 
two lines stepped up directly opposite 
each other. And each man bravely 
introduced himself to the young lady 
opposite him. Every thirty seconds 
a signal wras sounded on the ch'mes 
and the line of men moved up one, so 
that rach man met and talked for 
thirty seconds with every girl in the 
Design School. The idea of intro
ducing oneself bought about many 
coy blushes and stammered remarks. 
In reality it will hardly be possible 
for any young lady to pass a man in 
the corridors now with an I dont 
know you stare on her face. After 
the walk there were a few dance num
bers, the affair breaking up about six 
oclock.
The idea of the walk was to get 
everybody acquainted so as to further 
the success of the Medieval Ball.
THE PLAYERS CALLING.
HISTORICALLY CORRECT
Costumes
OF ALL KINDS 
AND ALL NATIONS
FOR HIRE
Esser Bros.711
Penn Avenue
Our first tradition of the stage is 
that a chap, Thesis tottled about 
the country in his cart, and from the 
tail-end of it, which was the first 
stage, began to represent life. This 
was at the Dionysuisian Festival, 
harvest time, when the natural heart 
of man turned instinctively to his God 
to thank Him for the bread by wrhich 
he lived. At such a time these early 
Pagens erected a temple to life; that 
was the first theatre. A place wThere 
one could go to live in the lives of 
others, to have their charities quick
ened, their sympathies broadened, the 
wings of imagination spread and 
brotherhood proved. That was the 
need of the theater then and that is 
its need and use today.
There will be a dearth of architects 
next Saturday in the draughting 
room, judging from the sign-ups for 
that Cleveland trip.
THE PLAY S THE THING.
Mr. Donald Robertson, instructor 
in charge of the dramatic students of 
the Design School, gave an intensely 
interesting talk Friday, October 28, 
in the Design Theater. His subject 
was, The Players Calling, and his 
remarks may be taken as authorita
tive.
Mr. Robertson said: The need is
imperative that those who aspire to a 
stage career should be profoundly 
convinced that such is a calling. In 
the Biblical sense it is a duty laid 
upon one by the Almighty to reveal 
to men the heart of man. Unless you 
are suffused with truth do not dare 
to meddle wTith life.
In reference to the w-ord Player 
he said: I have no objection to be
ing called an Actor but so much non
sense has been attached to the word 
lately that I prefer to be called a 
Player. For art, like all arts, our art, 
the oldest of arts, began in play. The 
babe that tottled about Eves knee, 
plucked a twig from some forbidden 
shrub and rode a cockhorse to Ban
bury Bush. It plunged the dragons 
that lay hidden in the shadows, 
washed its hands in the sunlight, mut
tered in articulate nothings that only 
the mother-heart of Eve could under
stand. It played; and there was the 
first actor, so you see, we come of an 
old and ancient lineage. Play is a 
primal instinct of life. Play brings 
recreation, which if you take the word 
apart a little is recreation.
The Daughters of the American 
Revolution were very agreeably en
tertained Wednesday evening in the 
theatre of the School of Applied De
sign, wTith Wm. Ellery Leonards In
dian Episode Glory of the Morning. 
The stage setting at once translated 
the audience into the land of the 
Red man and was probably the 
strongest factor in the play, in which 
action is notable for its absence.
It is a monotorial characteristic of 
the immobility of the Indian counte
nance.
You feel the glowthe warmth of 
the red light pervading the scene, 
close your eyes and dream of The 
Fur Trading of the Far North. It 
is the old story, of the marriage of 
the pale face to the squaw, with its 
inevitable consequence.
Mr. Charles Meredith, as the cheva
lier, looked the part of the French 
trapper, but it is not a very suitable 
vehicle for his talent.
Miss Annabel Ramsey was well cast 
as Glory of the Morning, and read 
her lines well, while Miss Inez Krebs, 
as Oakleaf, was viewed from an en
tirely new anglethe half-growm In
dian girl with the instincts of her 
pale-faced father. Her high-keyed 
voice and nervous, rapid utterance 
were in strong contrast with the level, 
repressed speech of her Winebago 
mother and carried out the idea of her 
immaturity.

CARNEGIE MECH. 
ENG. SOCIETY.
Following out the success attained 
at the last meeting of the Carnegie 
Mechanical Engineering Society, 
President B. Schwartz has secured 
for the next meeting, November 10th, 
a man who promises to be even more 
interesting than Mr. McNamara was.
Engaged for many years in steam 
and other engineering practice, and 
having during that time devised num
berless inventions of various sorts, 
Mr. John F. Robertson is particularly 
fitted to discuss An Inventors 
Troubles.
The next meeting of the C. M. E. S. 
will be held Wednesday evening, No1- 
vember 10th, at 8:00 P. M., in the 
Science club room, where the last 
meeting was held. A reflectoscope 
will be used to partly illustrate some 
of the things Mr. Robertson will show 
and speak about. The usual smokes 
and eats will be distributed and music 
will be in vogue after the lecture.
STUDENT BRANCH A. I. E E. 
MEETS TONIGHT. 
Schoepf, Chairman of Local Section, 
Will Speak.
The Electricals Club, the C. I. T. 
Student Branch of the A. I. E. E., 
will have the pleasure of hearing a 
lecture by Mr. T. H. Schoepf, chair
man of the Pittsburgh Section of the 
Institute tonight. His subject will 
be the relation between the engineer 
and the national organization. This 
will include the plans of the Pitts
burgh Section for the coming year, 
and an endeavor to obtain the active 
co-operation of our branch with this 
section.
The president announces the fol
lowing appointments: W. D. Drum
mond, chairman of the local industrial 
power committee, whose duty will be 
to gather and disseminate informa

Second Quarter.
The second quarter started right 
after Tech had made her third touch
down, and on the next play after the 
kickoff Roberts hit left guard for 12 
yards.
The big halfback had found a weak
ness at Techs left guard, and again 
and again he and Peterman were shot 
through for good gains, until the ball 
had been advanced 50 yards, when 
Tech took a brace and threw Peter
man for a 10-yard loss. Then Henry 
tried for a field goal for Hiram from 
the 38-yard line, but failed, the ball 
going to Findlay on the 7-yard line. 
Findlay shook off two Hiram tacklers and ran for a 40-yard gain before 
being downed. Findlay then tore off 
18 yards around right end and Kesner 
took the ball from the 33-yard line to 
within 7 yards of the goal, from where 
Techs fourth touchdown was made 
on a forward pass, Kesner to Gibson,
