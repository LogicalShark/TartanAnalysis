Bye!
It has become my pleasure to relinquish my position as editor to Clara 
Herron, and bid a fond farewell to the activities of the Carnegie Tartan. 
The farewell, though not tearful, is certainly regretful.
I doubt that I shall ever again work with as cooperative a group as my 
editorial staff, or that I shall ever again have as receptive a reading audi
ence as I have enjoyed this past year. I should like to thank you all, and 
ask that you accept the new editor as gracefully and sympathetically as 
you accepted me.
I now bequeath unto you, Clara, the editors desk, the combination to 
the mailbox, the complaints and suggestions, and the genuine thrill of 
being responsible for a temperamental baby, the Carnegie Tartan.
And unto you, readers, I bequeath a new editorial staff. A. C. H.
Hi!
When we joined the staff of the Carnegie Tartan in the fall of 1943, the 
campus was going through a transitional period between peacetime and 
wartime college life. The civilian men were departing in droves, and the 
remaining students were taking their resentment of the wartime situation 
out on the innocent ASTs. An increasingly greater proportion of the 
important positions on campus were being filled by women, and the frat 
man faced the horrible thought that he might become at least temporarily 
an extinct species at Carnegie. The problems and dislocations which war 
had brought to the campus were recorded in this paper, one of the few 
publicatipns to weather the storm; and in this editorial column, the Editors 
first T. J. Harmony, and later Louisa Saul and Allen Van Patton, recorded 
the feelings of the students and attempted to guide them through the crisis. 
It is due in no small part to their efforts that the transition was completed 
successfully.
During the summer of 1945 the first sign that the transition from war 
to peace might soon begin was seen in the final departure of the last rem
nants of the ASTP. During that terribly hot summer, Ernie Lowenstein, 
with an extremely inexperienced staff under him, kept the Tartan in 
existence, and fought through the editorial column to keep ACAC from 
expiring from heat prostration; and in the fall he stimulated Citcom to new 
life. Last semester Adeline Herlick did a wonderful job when she demanded 
that ACAC be a truly representative body and again when she voiced the 
student side of the Dormitory Curfew dispute.
Now we have inherited the editorial chair and typewriter. With it has 
been bequeathed the job of airing the gripes and expressing the opinions 
of the student body of Carnegie Tech and of trying to guide them through 
another transitional period. For the transition form war back to peace has 
definitely begun on campus. We do not mean to imply that the students of 
CIT are unaware of the battles now being fought or that they are unduly 
optimistic concerning an early end of the conflict. The excellent response 
to the ambulance drive should be sufficient proof of their intention to win 
the war before enjoying the peace. Nor do we mean that campus social and 
intellectual life is back on a peacetime basis. But we have seen in the 
return of the student governing council to its pre-war constitution and 
appelation, in the imminent reopening of the DU House, in the increasing 
numbers of veterans arriving at each new registration, in the elevation of 
the standards of mens honoraries, and in the new-found stability of the 
staffs of such organizations as the Tartan itself, definite signs of a return 
to peacetime life.
The transition from peace to war was important because on its success 
depended Carnegies ability to remain open during the few years of war
time. The transition from war to peace is even more important for on its 
success depends the whole structure of college social and intllectual lifee 
not for a few years but possibly for a hundred years after the war. The 
traditions established or revived now will be observed by generations of 
Skibos students. The amount of control exerted now by the frat-sorority 
machine over campus politics will in large part determine the political 
structure of the campus for many years. Advances made in democratic stu
dent control of student affairs and in new methods of instruction on campus 
now will benefit the commuters and the dorm students of 1995-96 as well 
as those of 1945-46 and will keep the scholastic rating of CIT at the top in 
future years.But mistakes made now will carry over into the future too. It is the duty 
of the Editor of the Tartan to try to keep those mistakes from being made. 
By keeping old traditions alive and helping to establish new ones, by 
suggesting that a bit of disinfectant be applied to strategic political sore 
spots, and by backing every progressive social or intellectual improvement 
proposed during the coming year we will try our uptmost to fulfill that
duty.C.H.
Opinions expressed in the pages of the TARTAN are those of the members of the 
Itaff; in the case of the editorial column they are those of the Editor. They are not 
to be construed as necessarily the opinions of either the student body or the faculty.

Letter to the Editor
To everyone on the campus:
Probably all of us have a restless 
desire to participate actively in the 
war. Some of us are too young while 
many of us on campus are too old, 
and some of us naturally must re
main at home to carry on the work 
and take care of the home-front. But 
we can ALL take our places on the 
war-front via the United National 
Clothing Collection campaign on 
our campus from April 9th to 21st.
The purpose of the Collection is to 
secure the maximum quantity of 
good used clothing, shoes, and bed
ding for free distribution to needy 
and destitute men, women and chil
dren in war-devastated countries. 
War statistics tell us that 125 million 
of the liberated people of Europe 
are in desperate need of clothing, 
shoes and bedding. There are more 
than 30 million children among 
those in dire need. In fact, deaths 
from exposure equalled and in some 
sectors surpassed those due to star
vation and malnutrition. This na
tion-wide movement under the 
chairmanship of Mr. Henry J. Kais
er hopes to obtain 150 million 
pounds of good usable clothing, 
shoes and bedding and ship it for 
overseas relief.
We believe these articles are 
available in the attic and storageplaces of all our homes and we ap
peal to you ,to search them out, bring 
them to the campus, and deliver to a 
Committee-Member in charge of 
tollections for your group or build
ing. What is needed is good substan
tial used clothing for both winter 
and summer wear. Although cloth
ing need not be in perfect repair, it 
must be useful to the people who 
receive it. Underclothing and all 
types of cotton garments should be 
washed before they are donated but 
need not be ironed. Evening dresses, 
tuxedos, and dress suits CANNOT 
be used.
Remember these people are in

Clara Herron, the new editor, is 
the veteran of two full years work 
on the Tartan, and has been on the 
staff longer than any other member. 
She will be a Maggie Murph junior 
next fall. The new managing editor, 
Augie Binder, has come a long way 
since first joining the staff a year 
ago, and now has the large job of 
managing editor. He is a junior 
physicist. News Editor Mary Jane 
Horridge, has obtained that position 
after much hard work. She will be 
a junior secretarial in the fall. Betty 
Lou Girts and Harold Gottesman 
are both new to the editorial board, 
but show much promise.
It was decided at the meeting to 
try to return as close as possible to 
normal operating conditions. It was 
also decided to wait until fall to 
determine who would fill the other 
editorial positions.

THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, APRIL 10, 1945
One of the Girls
Clunk, clunk, clunk, crash! We are 
introducing Dottie King, that straw
berry blond wearing a black and red 
plaid shirt, holding in one hand 
The Pocketbook of Verse, in the 
other a hammer with which she is 
not too cautiously chipping the plas
ter from a buxom nude statue. In 
some ways Dottie, a busy efferves
cent, witty personality, is a typical 
artist. She is intense, enthusiastic, 
and invigorated with a colorful in
terest in people, events, activities, 
theories, and philosophies. With this 
interest she in turn invigorates all 
who know her. Her naturalness and 
outgoingness have won her many 
friends, friends which include jani
tors, waitresses, farmers, professors, 
and scientists. She is a good friend, 
too, always willing to help, always 
fun and interesting to be with. To 
illustrate her active participation in 
the world about her, we will list the 
odd jobs (and I do mean odd) 
which she has held in these four 
years. While she was a Freshman, 
her fame in patching pottery spread 
far and wide. To her came broken 
vases, shattered plates, decapitated 
statues, and a jumble of just plain 
pieces, brought by the most insig
nificant student to the most eminent 
faculty members, many who hoped 
to have these casualties repaired be
fore Aunt Jane, Mom, or the maid 
discovered that her most precious 
piece of china had been liquidated. 
Also during her Freshman year, 
Dottie became the illustrious Rink 
(not pink) Secretary of the Pitts
burgh Figure Skating Club. As such 
she checked the members in and 
out and met a lot of wonderful peo
ple. In the summer of this same 
year our heroine became file (not 
to be confused with foul) clerk 
at Fischer Scientific Company, 
where she filed papers and letters 
under ABCDE, etc. and dreamed 
constantly and fervently of fall and 
dear old Carnegie Tech. That win
ter, her Sophomore year, she was 
invited back as Rink Secretary of 
the Pittsburgh Figure Skating Club
. . . Dottie King
which had become so attached to her 
smile that they could not think of 
anyone else checking them in and 
out. The next summer Dottie re
turned to Fischer Scientific and in
nocently asked for a better job to
which they informed her, in a man
ner reserved for parents and per
sonal agents, that at Fischer Sci
entific employees work from the 
bottom up. The only other job at 
the bottom was on the assembly 
line; so Dottie spent her second 
summer screwing screws and bolt
ing bolts all for defense and $19.50.
As a Junior Miss King tore her
self away from the Pittsburgh Fig
ure Skating Club and took up teach
ing at Maxada School. Summer,
1944, also found her free from the 
bottom rung of Fischer Scientific. 
Instead she delved into plastic sur
gery at Vernon-Benshoff. Trained as 
she was in sculpture and desiring to 
use t^his training usefully, Dottie 
spent many hours modelling hands, 
ears, and noses to replace ones lost 
at the factory, on the battlefields, or 
in accidents. She was working with 
a material, which was still in its ex
perimental stage. Coloring and 
matching so that the plastic parts 
looked as real as possible were par
COLLEGE FADS AND FANCIES, 
*3K> CLASS OF 18c
Fads and fancies in college costumes are by 
no means modern phenomena. Here is a 
gay undergraduate of the Qass of 1850. 
Observe his flowing collar and tie, his super 
expanse of Panama brim, and his studied 
air of nonchalance.
This was in 1850, when America was 
basking in peace. The Golden West was 
opening up, and Express Service was keep
ing pace. Today, there are few fads and fan
cies on the college campus. They have given 
place to the uniformity and efficiencies of 
war time. Thousands of students are con
centrated on the needs of the nation in arms.
Railway Express is devoting its nation
wide services, both rail and air, primarily 
to speeding war materiel. To help all con

ticular problems with which Dottie, 
as an artist, was concerned. She has 
continued this work throughout her 
Senior year and is now teaching 
military personnel about the prin
ciples of coloring plastic limbs. Also 
among her jobs this year is that of 
teaching art at Maxada Woodlands 
Private Grade School.
In her spare time Dottie King 
studies sculpture at Carnegie Tech. 
According to the popular tradition, 
her career originated when she was 
a little hoyden squeezing mud pies 
in her grimy hands. It culminated 
when, as a Freshman, she was 
caught in the rat-trap situation. Be
cause Dottie was late registering 
and because the P&D Department 
was filled to capacity, she had little 
alternative but to become a sculp
ture student. Her first three years 
were completely absorbed in her 
work, her art. (KEERASH! . . . 
that was the statues head. Dotty 
just knocked it off.) In her fourth 
year she decided to quit griping 
about the conditions on campus, 
about activities, about publications, 
about student governmentand in
stead DO something about them; as 
a result she became involved in 
campus activities which eventually 
included Rush Chairman of Kappa 
Alpha Theta, News Editor of the 
Tartan, and Art Editor of the Tech
nical. She is also a member of the 
Associated Artists, having exhibit
ed in two shows; and a member of 
the Society of Sculptors, having paid 
her dues. Occasionally King has 
time to sketch portraits at the USO 
canteen or at Deshon Hospital. All 
in all these little things keep her 
maddeningly busy.
Since Dottie insisted that I stick 
this in somewhere, I might as well 
toss it in now. It is a favorite quota
tion and one which reflects her 
now famous philosophy that life is 
an inescapable trap.
I am the daughter of earth and 
water
The nurseling of the sky;

The exhibit, Thirteen Abstract 
Painters, which opened on the first 
of April at the Outlines Gallery, 222 
Craft Avenue, is the first of its kind 
ever held in Pittsburgh. Over thirty 
abstract paintings are included in 
the exhibit, and its purpose is to 
show a cross-section of this rapidly 
expanding modern school of art.
The artists whose work is shown 
range from young painters, compar
atively unknown, to several topranking artists whose work is rep
resented in many museums and in 
private collection. But, although 
three local artists have work in the 
show, most of the Thirteen Ab
stract Painters are showing their 
work in Pittsburgh for the first 
time.
On April 8, at 8:30 p. m. Balcomb 
Greene, Carnegie Tech professor of 
art history, will give a talk on the 
exhibit and on the aims of abstract 
painting. Both his own work and 
that of his wife are included in the 
exhibition. Pittsburgh artists whose 
work is shown are Sam Rosenberg, 
Russel Twiggs and Robert Lepper; 
other abstractionists in the show 
include Karl Knaths, Byron Bowne, 
George L. K. Morris and Jean Xercon. The exhibit, open daily except 
Mondays from 6 to 11 p. m., will 
continue through April 29.
I change but I cannot die.
Incidentally we may add that the 
gym program is doing its best to al
leviate this awkward situation.

Phi Kappa Phi Admits 
Thirty-three Members
On April 4 the Phi Kappa Phi all
school scholastic honorary fraternity 
held its initiation banquet at the 
University Club. The banquet fol

Dr. Elliott Dunlap Smith, Maurice 
Falk Professor of Social Relations, 
was the speaker of the evening at 
the iniation banquet. Professor 
Smith chose as his subject Pasteur 
and the Challenge of Success, and 
emphasized throughout his address 
two beliefs which dominated Pas
teurs life and guided him toward 
great achievement; First, that ac
complishment does not demand gen
ius, but rather constant striving 
toward some worthy goal; and sec
ond, that recognitions of success 
should not curtail endeavor.
Director Charles Watkins, toast
master at the banquet, introduced, 
in addition to Professor Smith, Pro
fessors R. M. Boarts and J. C. 
Hodges of the University of Ten
nessee, where one of the original 
chapters of Phi Kappa Phi is locat
ed.
Director Watkins announced the 
establishment of the Ihrig-Lawler 
Memorial Scholarship Fund by the 
present Phi Kappa Phi Chapter and 
introduced Mr. Leo T. Lawler who 
was an honor guest of the Society.
Third Ambulance Bought; 
$195 Credited on Fourth
The Carnegie Tech War Stamp 
Drive has just gone over the top 
again. Iris Kwall, chairman of the 
War Stamp Committee announced 
last week that sufficient money has 
been collected to purchase a third 
ambulance and $195 can be credited 
on the account of a fourth.
The sale of stamps at the booths, 
which was substantially increased 
last week by the concert ticket offer, 
has now netted a total of $1,897. 
Added to the money received from 
bond sales, this sum reaches a grand 
total of $10,485.

CIT Wrestling Team 
Entertains Soldiers
The Wrestling Team of Carnegie 
Tech visited the Deshon Hospital on 
Friday, April 6, to present a wrest
ling exhibition to the wounded 
Army veterans. Since the match was 
purely an exhibition, the boys from 
Tech were divided into two teams.
Blue TeamRichard Stanley, 135 
pound; Bruce Schmid, 155 pound; 
James Flemming, 155 pound; Wen
dell Minor (C), 175 pound;; Carlo 
Martino, unlimited.
Black TeamWilliam Dickerson, 
135 pound; John Metcalf, 155 pound; 
Don Rubinfield, 155 pound; Robert 
Staffney (C), 175 pound; Albert 
Schindled, unlimited.
The winners of the bouts were as 
follows:
135 pound class. .William Dickerson
155 pound class...........Bruce Schmid
155 pound class........Don Rubenfield
175 pound class........Wendell Minor
Unlimited Class.. .Albert Schindler
These victories gave the Bleack 
team the match by a score of 3 to 2.
The conclusion of the evenings 
entertainment was an exhibition of 
professional wresting by Si Brown, 
the referee of the previous bouts, 
who was Olympic Champion of the 
129 pound class in 1924 and Cecil 
(Don), the coach of the boys from 
Carnegie Tech, who was A. A. U. 
Champion, Allegheny Section, in 
1935. This bout was enjoyed im
mensely since it was put on under 
the rules of professional wrestling 
which allows the use of strangling 
and torturing holds. At times the 
bout became so rough that the 
referee was forced to tear the boys 
apart. When he tried to do this, he 
was attacked by both wrestlers and 
pounded until he was forced to re
tire to the opposite side of the mat.
The time keeping was handled by 
Mr. Moses, and Mr. Risedorph serv
ed as announcer.

D.U. House Opening 
Proves False Rumor
There have been numerous rum
ors floating around campus for the 
last few weeks, concerning the re
opening of the DU House. The hustle 
and bustle going on in its vicinity 
last Saturday served to substantiate 
the idle gossip for many observers.
The truth of the matter is that 
since only four DUs expect to re
main on campus over summer, the 
opening of the house, originally 
scheduled for this spring, will not 
occur until October. The hustle and 
bustle was caused only by a few of 
the bigger hearted gals going 
through the spring housecleaning 
ritual, aparently for the fun of it.

The other, which was a stumpy, 
putty-looking nose, however, quited 
him, and they returned to the busi

convinced that our search was over, 
since we had finally tracked down 
these two fabulous characters.-There 
was certainly no doubt about it. 
They were really a pair.
Nor is there any point in enum

they claim is Ralphs action for the

William A. Conwell has been pro

of the AAF Engineer Command, he 
supervises the work of all sections 
under Headquarters and is respon
sible for the building and maintain
ing of airfields to base Mediterran
ean Allied Air Forces.
Col. Conwell was graduated from 
Carnegie Tech in 1929. He entered 
the service in January, 1941, and 
has been overseas since January, 
1943. In addition to the Legion of 
Merit, he wears the American De
fense Ribbon and a European cam
paign ribbon.
Staff Sgt. Herbert P. Levison has 
been awarded the Air Medal for 
meritorious achievement while par

enemy. He enlisted in January,

famous one-point curve for Lou

Laushey promptly joined the Navy. 
Then Duke fell into step with Ralph, 
who had already gained fame, or 
should I say notoriety, for his earlier 
escapades. This combination, how
ever, was about to set new wartime 
standards at Tech. As they blazed 
their way across the last four semes
ters, they left behind them trails of 
broken records, bottles, women. 
Now, as they approach their gradua
tion, it is necessarily appropriate 
that some record be left for poster

First Lieutenant George J. Dzombak recently returned home on leave 
after completing his tour of duty 
with the Ninth Air Force. As a pilot 
with the 397th Bombardment Group, 
Lt. Dzombak flew over 60 combat

8TH& dARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, APRIL 10, 1945The Plaid
Banquet Resume 
Not an Obituary
The Thirtieth Engineers Banquet 
is now history. It isnt necessary to 
write the complete obituary of that 
successful affair. It will suffice mere
ly to mention a few of the high
lights.
The earnest discussion of China 
and its philosophy of life by Mr. 
Herbert Graham of the Jones and 
Laughlin Company was certainly 
timely and to the point. Listening to 
his descriptions, one realized that 
there are people in foreign land^ to 
whom we can look for a philosophy 
of life compatible with our love of 
freedom.
Lieutenant Balfours excellent dis
cussion of the naval situation in the 
Pacific was very well received by 
the audience.
In addition to these two excellent 
speakers, the competent work of 
Prof. Mavis as toastmaster augment
ed the intimate informal tales of the 
other faculty guests. Of course the 
student officers added their little bit 
to round out an enjoyable period of 
story telling.

In many respects, the floor show 
was the most successful in years. To 
hear the encouraging pleading 
voices of the male chorus remind
ed one of the Kentucky Derby or

To those of the faculty and to 
those gracious ladies who so gladly 
gave of their time and effort to in
sure the banquets success, the com
mittee can scarcely express its grat
itude and appreciation.

An invasion fleet of several hundred warships uses 
some 48,000 telephonesfrom 1,500 on a battle? 
ship to 10 on a motor torpedo boat. Thats as 
many as are used by most cities of 160,000!
Our fighting men are using telephones, wire, 
switchboards, and other communications equip?
 ment in huge quantities. And Western Electric 
workers, peacetime suppliers to the Bell System, 
are busy meeting those needs.
That is why there are not enough home tele
phones right now. But we are looking forward to 
the day when the Bell System can again provide 
telephone service to anyone, anywhere, at any time.
