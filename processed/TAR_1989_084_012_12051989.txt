Losing touch with reality: Trippin on LSD at CMU
By FARRON W. LEVY
Tartan Assistant News Editor
Editors note: Frank Martin is a ficti
tious name for a Carnegie Mellon student 
who wishes to remain anonymous.
Sometimes Frank Martin feels the side 
effects of his lifestyle. With all the shit 
Ive done  I lose touch with reality 
sometimes, he says. My memory is shot 
to hell, I zone out. Like this morning, 
everything was moving so fast and I was 
moving so slow.
Martin, a freshman, doesnt trip any
more. His last hit of acid was about 6 
months ago. For now, hell just stick with 
smoking pot and, when available, doing 
mushrooms.
On November lS, sophomore Ra Kakar 
was brought to Presbyterian Hospital 
after taking two hits of triple dip (triple 
strength) black beauty (a type of LSD). 
He thought it was single dip. The three 
people with him managed to handle the 
dosage by themselves, but he is now on a 
leave of absence and in rehabilitation.
A similar occurrence happened on 
campus the following Tuesday, this time 
with a student from the University of
Pittsburgh.
These incidents prompted Michael 
Murphy, acting dean of Student Affairs, 
to issue a statement to the campus. This 
LSD the people got was much different 
from what they expected, he told The 
Tartan. We felt an obligation to warn 
the campus community.
Murphy praised the discussions 
prompted by the incident. LSD has 
waned in popularity over the past twenty 
years," he pointed out. Many people dont 
know the dangers. Theyre inherently 
dangerous but also theres the manufac
turing process, you dont always know
what youre getting.
Martin isnt worried. His source for 
drugs is reliable and always tells him the 
strength of the acid hes buying; after all, 
its a business. The stronger the acid, the 
higher the price.
Sergeant William Ricci of the Carnegie 
Mellon police force stresses the dangers of 
LSD. Cocaine is bad, and then theres 
marijuana. Theyre addictive, but you can 
recover. But acid, its a very, very danger
ous thing: A one-time shot can ruin your 
whole life. You can take it one time or a 
thousand timesuntil that bad trip, and

At least three burglaries occurred in 
Morewood Gardens as residents of the 
rooms slept on Wednesday, November 22. 
An arrest was made in only one of the 
three cases.
Two rooms in Morewood C-Tower were 
burglarized early Wednesday morning, one 
between 1 and 3 am and the other at 3:04 
pm. A third room in E-Tower was burglar
ized later Wednesday morning. A suspect 
was apprehended for the 3:04 burglary.
In all three cases, the burglar or bur
glars entered through an unlocked door.
The alleged burglar, a student, is being 
dealt with by Student Affairs.
According to Carnegie Mellon Police 
Sergeant William Ricci, one of the victims, 
a freshman, woke up and saw a stranger in 
his unlocked room. When the stranger

Search committees 
expand short list
By MICHAEL J. EWEDOSH
Tartan News Editor
The short list of candidates in Carnegie 
Mellons presidential search continues to 
change as the search progresses. The lat
est change in the list is what one search 
committee member called an augmenta
tion of the list.
We didnt feel comfortable with the list 
as it was, said Otto Davis, a professor 
from Social and Decision Sciences who is 
on the faculty search committee. We 
decided to augment  or add to  the 
short list.
Davis explained the decision to add to
the list as a response to feelings that the 
list, which formerly included four people, 
wasnt adequate to assure that the com
mittees would get a conclusion we liked. 
Presidential searches being conducted 
by at other universities also impact Car
negie Mellons search because several can
didates are being considered by more than 
one university, said Davis.
In fact, two of the four who were on the 
original short list removed their names 
from the list because of a search at their; 
home institution  MIT.
Another factor Davis attributed to the 
short list expansion is that many of the

Experts refute rumors of unwholesome food from CMDS
By MICHAEL J. EWEDOSH
Tartan News Editor
Rumors of food-borne illness in 
Dining Service products are un
founded, according to the Al
legheny County Health Depart
ments chief of food protection, 
Glenda Christy, and Carnegie 
Mellons director of Health Serv
ices, Anita Barkin.
While the rumors have not 
prompted an investigation, 
Christy said that Carnegie 
Mellons facilities are inspected 
regularly by ACHD officials.
We havent had anything 
lately, she said when asked about 
specific problems with Carnegie 
Mellon Dining Service establish
ments.
We have had no cases of bacte
rial gastrointeritis clearly involv
ing a food source, said Barkin. 
She described two incidents that 
prompted further investigation 
one in which a student contracted 
bacterial gastrointeritis, and 
another in which several Theta 
Xi brothers suffered similar symp
toms common to a bacterial infec
tion. Neither were clearly related 
to any food-borne illness.
Bacterial gastrointeritis is a 
common food-borne illness. Those 
suffering from it typically develop 
diarrhea. But, says Barkin, it is 
not only a food-borne illness; the 
bacteria can also be found in and 
contracted from the soil.
Other types of food-borne ill
ness also can arise from parasites 
present in the food.
If foods are stored and pre
pared properly, she said, you 
shouldnt get a bacterial infection 
from them.
According to Barkin, the out
break of a food-borne illness on 
campus would be marked by a 
number of people suffering from 
the same symptoms after eating 
the same food.
Making a hypothetical case, 
Barkin said, If five or ten people 
came in who developed these 
symptoms in a 4-8 hour period, 
wed ask what and where they 
ate. If they all ate the egg salad at

Turnout low for Senate elections

A Phi Os Mike Reed counts votes 
after last week's Student Senate 
elections.
By PRISCILLA HSUE
Tartan Senior Staffwriter
Student Senate elections were 
held last Tuesday and Wednes
day. Of the 5855 students en
rolled at Carnegie Mellon, only 
405 voted  6.92 percent of the 
student body.
Student Government President 
Mark Mittelhauser says low voter 
turnout is a problem that many 
colleges around the country suf
fer. He believes that several fac
tors contributed to the low num
ber of students who voted.
This election occured right 
after Thanksgiving, he said. 
There was no time to poster, so 
students did not know when elec
tions were taking place. Also, elec
tions were moved inside one day, 
leading to confusion. 
Mittelhauser mentioned that 
fall elections have a traditionally 
low voter turnout as compared to 
elections held in the spring; the 
latter include voting for the stu
dent government president and 
debate over issues.
Student Senator Nicole Brock
mann felt that the low turnout 
was unfortunate.
She commented that students 
complain about the decisions 
made by Senate but do not take 
the time to vote for senators to 
represent them.

Carnegie Mellon in Brief
CS announces degree program, 
software developments
A new degree program in computer science will be offered for 
undergraduates beginning in the spring 1990 semester. The 
three-year program will be offered to current students in one of 
the MCS and CIT computer science double major programs. New 
students will complete their general first year coursework in 
either MCS or CIT before entering the program.
Students in Software Engineering, a 400-level, undergradu
ate computer science course taught by Mary Shaw and Bernd 
Bruegge, will be demonstrating a paperless fax system they 
developed for the Andrew computer system on Thursday in the 
Information Technology Center. Open demonstrations to the 
campus will be scheduled later.
The system, called Workstation Fax, extends the Andrew mes
sage system so that it can send and receive graphic images. 
Though still in the prototype stages, the system offers the possi
bility of developing a campus-wide electronic fax system.
University announces new 
head of Physics Department
Robert W. Kraemer, a high-energy physicist on Carnegie 
Mellons faculty for 25 years, has been named head of the 
Universitys Physics Department.
Kraemer came to Carnegie Mellon as an assistant professor in 
1964 and was named a professor in 1974.
Since 1983, he and three other Carnegie Mellon physicists have 
been part of an international collaboration at LEP, the worlds 
largest electron positron collider, housed at the European Center 
for Nuclear Research (CERN), near Geneva, Switzerland. At this 
site, more than 1,500 high-energy physicists are seeking two 
undiscovered particles predicted in the Standard Model of Par
ticle Physics.
Kraemer earned a bachelors degree in physics from LaSalle 
University and received a doctorate from Johns Hopkins Univer
sity in 1962. He was honored with Carnegie Mellons Ryan Teach
ing Award in 1982.
Hughes honored with Ladd 
Mech E Professorship
William F. Hughes, a member of Carnegie Mellon Universitys 
mechanical engineering faculty since 1955, has been named 
Ladd Professor of Mechanical Engineering.
The chaired professorship is funded through a bequest to the 
university by deceased Pittsburgh industrialist and Carnegie 
Institute of Technology Trustee George Tallman Ladd and his 
wife Florence. It honors faculty who have achieved distinction as 
teachers and researchers.
Hughes is an expert in magnetohydrodynamics, the study of 
the interaction of magnetic fields and conducting fluids.
Hughes received his bachelors, masters, and doctors degrees 
from the Carnegie Institute of Technology in 1952, 1953, and 
1955, respectively. He did post-doctoral work at Cambridge 
University in England and was a Fulbright lecturer in Australia 
in 1963.
Wright, alumnus and trustee, 
dies of cancer at 62
Alumnus and trustee Dale A. Wright died of cancer last 
Monday. He was 62 years old.
A member of the Universitys Board ofTrustees, Wright gradu
ated from Carnegie Tech in 1948 with a bachelors degree in 
electrical engineering. He later earned law degrees from the 
George Washington University School of Law.
As an undergraduate at Carnegie Tech, Wright was an Honor 
Junior initiate ofTau Beta Pi, and president of Eta Kappa Nu. He 
was involved in many campus activities, including the Kiltie 
Band, Student Council, and Spring Carnival. He and his wife 
have given the university $100,000 for the Dale A. Wright Radio 
Center to provide quarters in the University Center for WRCT.

Gadhafi confines 
terrorist under 
house arrest
NEW YORK (AP)  Palestin
ian terrorist Abu Nidal has been 
placed under house arrest by 
Libya in recent days, according to 
last Tuesdays edition of The New 
York Times.
Abu Nidal has been confined to 
the compound where he lives near 
Tripoli, the Libyan capital, as a 
result of Arab and Palestinian 
pressure to end his terrorist ac
tivities, which were becoming an 
obstacle to Arab diplomacy, the 
newspaper reported.
Abu Nidals organization, the 
Fatah Revolutionary Council, is 
believed responsible for terrorist 
attacks that have killed or 
wounded 900 people in at least 20 
countries since it was formed in 
1974.
Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion officials told the newspaper 
that Nidals detention could be 
the start of the demise of the Fatah 
Revolutionary Council. A grow
ing number of its leaders and 
members have defected to the 
PLO under pressure from the PLO 
and Arab governments.
The Times, quoting PLO offi
cials in Tunisia and Arab diplo
mats in Paris, said Egypts Presi
dent Hosni Mubarak in October
asked Libyan leader Colonel 
Moammar Gadhafi, as a condi
tion for restored relations between 
their countries, either to extra
dite Abu Nidal to Egypt or stop 
his undertaking terrorist acts 
from Libya.
There is no indication that 
Gadhafi intends to turn Abu Nidal 
over to Egypt, the officials said.
Coup fails; 
Aquino remains 
in power
MANILA (AP)  U.S. war
planes were dispatched to help 
save President Corazon Aquinos 
elected government after military 
rebels bombed the presidential 
palace Friday in the strongest bid 
yet to topple her.
However, the extent of U.S. 
involvement was fighter jets flying 
over the rebel-held Sangley and 
Villamor air bases near Manila, a 
U.S. official in Washington said.
President Bush authorized 
military assistance to back 
Aquinos government after rebels 
seized the two air bases, includ
ing the air force headquarters, 
and were moving artillery and 
armor into the capital.
The mutinous soldiers also 
seized two television stations.
By sundown, military chief of 
staff General Renato de Villa de
clared the coup attempt had failed 
and that loyal troops had recap
tured one of the bases seized by 
the rebels. He said 30 rebel offi
cers and 300 enlisted men had 
been captured.
But sporadic fighting contin
ued, and the mutineers were still 
in control of the government tele
vision station and parts of Vil
lamor air base, the air force head
quarters. The rebels, who ap
peared to be mainly from the army 
and the marines, were transportinglarge amounts of ammunition 
to Villamor from nearby Fort 
Bonifacio.

Supreme Court 
considers two 
abortion cases
WASHINGTON (DJ)  The 
Supreme Court was urged Thurs
day to rule that states can require 
minors to inform their parents 
before having an abortion, but 
the justices gave no hint whether 
they are reconsidering the right 
to abortion.
Officials from Ohio and Minne
sota defended their state abor
tion laws during two hours of oral 
argument, contending that the 
requirement that minors notify 
their parents furthers the states 
interest in helping parents raise 
their children.
But some justices appeared 
concerned that the Minnesota law, 
which requirfes that both parents 
be notified before an abortion 
unless a minor obtains a judges 
approval, may be too broad. Ques
tioning by some justices showed 
concern, for example, thatminors 
who were victims of child abuse 
might be forced to notify a parent 
who abused them.
To get right to the heart of it, 
the statute just doesnt provide
for any exceptions, said Justice 
Sandra OConnor, whose vote on 
the nine-member court is pivotal 
to the outcome of abortion cases. 
Justice Anthony Kennedy, who 
voted last spring to restrict the 
right to abortion, raised similar 
concerns. 
But the justices gave little indi
cation of how they feel about a 
major issue in the two cases: 
whether the Constitution requires 
states that impose parental noti
fication to provide also what is 
called a judicial bypass. A judi
cial bypass is a court hearing in 
which a minor may convince a 
judge that she is mature enough 
to decide to have an abortion 
without telling her parents, or 
that telling her parents isnt in 
her best interests.
Its unclear whether the con
cerns voiced by Justices OConnor 
and Kennedy mean they will 
conclude that a judicial bypass is 
required or whether they will 
simply decide that Minnesota 
should write some exceptions into 
its two-parent requirement.
State lawyers argued that no 
bypass is required. But abortionrights lawyers said that a judicial 
bypassmust be included, and that 
it has to be fair and not too diffi
cult for minors.
Abortion-rights lawyers argued 
that notification has much the 
same effect as requiring consent, 
in that it prompts some parents 
to try to block their daughters 
abortions and provokes child 
abuse.
Administration to 
raise defense 
budget for 91
WASHINGTON (DJ)Despite 
talk of a peace dividend, the 
Bush administration is likely to 
propose an increase in defense 
outlays for fiscal 1991, admini
stration officials say.
President Bush isnt expected 
to give final approval to the de
fense budget until he returns next 
week from his summit with So
viet leader Mikhail Gorbachev 
near Malta. But budget officials 
say the final proposal is almost 
certain to include an increase in 
defense outlays from about $285 
billion in the current fiscal year, 
though not enough of an increase 
to make up for inflation.
As a result, the administration 
will still have to find roughly $35 
billion in budget savings in other
areas to reach the GrammRudman laws deficit target of 
$64 billion for fiscal 1991, which 
begins next October 1.
The defense numbers under; 
score the limited value of the socalled peace dividend in the coniing years budget battle. Defense 
Secretary Dick Cheney has said 
that because of reduced tensions 
with the Soviet Union, hes look
ing to reduce total defense spend
ing over the next six years by 
much as $180 billion.
But most of those cuts will re
sult in lower outlays in 1992 and 
beyond. Much of the Pentagons 
actual spending in fiscal 1991 is 
determined by spending author
ity already granted by Congress.
Defense department officials 
say they havent received final 
figures on what President Bushs 
budget will propose.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  5 December 19893
By KARL S. BARNHART
\ Tartan Contributing Editor
An attempt to bum an American flag 
on campus nearly three weeks ago has 
sparked a debate about academic freeclbm that has left University administra
tors wondering how far they should go to 
protect the free expression of ideas.
Shortly after the flag-burning incident, 
^president Richard Cyert asked his Aca
demic Freedom Committee  an advi
sory committee appointed by the presii >3ent and including the Universitys at'iorney, selected deans, and selected pro
fessors  to help him come up with uni
versity-wide guidelines and policies about 
the expression of ideas.
Though no formal policies have been 
! established, the committee sent a pre
liminary proposal to the president last
Flag burning spurs discussion on freedoms within administration
Monday which recommended the Uni
versity support the expression of views 
even if doing so means breaking local, 
state, or federal laws.
If the act is illegal, the proposal says, 
the person shouldbe warned of the viola
tion but should not be stopped from 
expressing his or her views.
For example, if a student wanted to 
publish an article which libeled some
one, the proposed policy would not allow 
any member of the campus community 
to interfere with the student. Rather, the 
proposal says that the student should be 
warned that he or she is breaking the 
law and allowed to continue.
The only way the student could be 
stopped is if the act endangered people or 
property. The question we were trying 
to answer was whose business is it to 
enforce the law as long as there is no
gia r,lMC alU,4Ia umm Cva mu2t umm Cva Coya8888 
ivuC 2aM4a Cumsol1 uP,bC ot h,moIa rotI4a5

harm to others, said Thomas Kerr, an 
associate professor of law and committee 
member. If there is no harm to others, 
then the responsibility is to warn them 
and then to leave them alone, he said.
Interestingly, the proposed policy says 
that Carnegie Mellons Campus Police 
should primarily protect the rights of in
dividuals to express themselves rather 
than enforce laws. Since the members of
the department are police officers sworn 
to uphold the law, this policy seems to be 
contrary to the officers oaths.
The chief of Carnegie Mellons police, 
however, explained that this policy 
doesnt mean that police officers are 
obligated to enforce every law that they 
see broken.
We dont enforce all the laws all the 
time, said Chief James LaPaglia, or
wed be arresting everyone  including 
ourselves. What were talking about is 
police discretion.
Ironically, Jessica Caplan, the thirdyear art student who tried to bum the 
flag on November 9, still wouldnt be 
given permission to burn a flag even if 
the proposed policy were established by 
the president.
Burning is a special case. To bum any
thing on campus, students have to get 
permission from the dean of Student 
Affairs. If the fire poses no threat to 
people or buildings, the dean will give 
permission. However, even if the fire 
meets these criteria, the dean wouldnt 
allow it because flag burning breaks a 
federal law.
But, if the dean didnt know that the 
material to be burned was a flag, then 
the proposed policy would allow it.

fronted by a CMDS employee, also 
a Carnegie Mellon student, who 
was operating the register with 
the line. The employee told the 
student that if he wanted to go to 
the other register, he would have 
to leave the building and walk 
around to the other side. The 
student said that he was in a
hurry and kept going. The empl oyee grabbed him by the front of

. Special Business: Glen Walsh, 
a citizen concerned about Port 
Authority Transits removal of a

to the Senate about this issue. It 
seems to raise revenue, the PAT 
system has decided to raise fares 
for non-pass holders to $1.10 and 
keep the price ofmostpasses about 
the same. However, they have 
also proposed to remove the stu
dent discounted pass known as 
the U-Pass. While he and repre
sentatives of other college stu
dents spoke to the PAT hearing 
about this, no resolution was 
agreed upon. Mark Mittelhauser
sent a written statement to rep
resent the views of Carnegie 
Mellon students. He has thus 
taken it on himself to organize a 
group to speak at the county Board 
of Supervisors annual budget 
hearing since this group finances 
most of PAT operations. He asked 
for a Carnegie Mellon student rep
resentative, and this was referred 
to the Campus Affairs commit
tee.
Activities Board: There is 
currently a limit of270 people per

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon *5 December 19895
CMU researcher arrested at protest of Salvadoran military aid
By ByAAtr ad ionf
Tartan Assistant News Editor
Peter Shell, a research scien' list at Carnegie Mellon, andseven 
' other city residents were arrested 
as they protested U.S. Senator 
John Heinz Ills vote for military 
aid to El Salvador.
The protest occurred after Heinz 
' (R-Penn.) refused to schedule a 
meeting with the group, who re; fused to leave his office.
The protestors were released 
from jail on their own recogni
zance, since the protest was peace; fill.
Wednesdays hearing was fa
vorable for the group, according 
to Shell. We thought wed be fined 
$100 or so  the usual for a mis
demeanor. Instead we all got 8 
hours of community service, which 
well happily use to organize the 
next protest.
We did not have them ar
rested, said Grant Oliphant, a 
spokesman for Heinz. The build
ing management arrested and 
evicted them. We could not stand 
in the way of their decision. 
Oliphant claims that it was not 
that Heinz didnt want to meet 
with the protestors, but that it 
was the end of the Senate session 
and his many commitments pregia ror l,C vuLa Cvay u44atCar8 Bva Pbomrol1 yulu1a5

vented him from meeting with 
them.
I dont know what the status of 
their request [for a meeting] is 
now, he added.
The protestors call for no more 
military aid to the Salvadoran
government, an immediate cease
fire, serious negotiations with 
opposition groups, an end to the 
systematic repression against 
the churches, labor unions and 
opposition groups, and the full 
investigation of the murder of the
Jesuit priests.
According to Shell, Its largely 
a war between the poor and the 
rich. Over 50 percent are unem
ployed.... There are organizations 
and churches helping the poor 
and it seems that the government
sees any of these groups as the 
enemy. He points out that I dont 
feel its my responsibility to fix all 
the problems in El Salvador, but 
my tax dollars are going down 
there.
He calls attention to a figure of 
$3.5 billion that the U.S. govern
ment has given in aid to El Salva
dor over 9 years.
Its an unfortunate case, Ol
iphant argued. Its very volatile 
and very emotional ... the right 
[wing] and left [wing] want the 
U.S. out of El Salvador  but if 
we pull out, we leave the door 
open for [the communists] to pull
Losing touch with reality: a students story about trippin on LSD
continued from page 1
you may never come back.
Looking back to when he went to col. ]ege, Ricci says, I know a lot of people 
1 are fried to this day ... a lot of intelligent 
'people are just short-circuited. Within 
! ten years of taking acid, you could be out
* somewhere and go back into the trip 
* have a flashback. [LSD] stays with your 
 neurological system, makes genetic al
terations, and causes birth defects.
Martin has heard about the permajient effects of LSD. I wonder about that 
I a lot  I dont want to have kids with 
four heads or something. Thats part of 
the reason that Im not doing it right 
> now. He points out that people know the 
; effects of smoking or drinking, yet they 
[ still do it. Sometimes you get just unbe
lievable enjoyment [from LSD].
! One very real danger for Martin is the 
! possibility of a bad trip. Although he 
!hasnt experienced one, he has friends

who have. Its like a horror movie, its 
sheer hell. I know people who have sworn 
off drugs forever [because of the experi
ence]. You can never tell how [LSD] will 
affect you. Youll get different results at 
different times and between different 
people.
A big question is the prevalence of LSD 
on campus. There is some sense its not 
a major problem, but its still therewe 
gauge it by behavioral problems on 
campus and we havent had any prob
lems, says Murphy.
Ricci states, There have always been 
drugs on campus. LSD died out but lately 
it seems to be making a comeback.
Martin gives his assessment of the 
situation. I cant say for sure, but with 
the crowd I hang out with, yeah, there is 
a lot [of acid]. I dont know too much 
about campus-wide use. I basically did 
acid with the same group of friends ... 
but I know its out there. I do know it was 
big two summers ago, real big.
Martin finds that shipments of LSD 
are unpredictable, but when they come 
in, they are big. Whenever it comes in, 
people trip until its all gone. Then you 
have to wait for another shipment. Its 
probably just because of the people I 
hang out with, but it just seems its out in 
the open.
In general, the incident hasnt radi
cally altered our perception of the [drug] 
problem.... It has allowed us to reiterate 
concern on campus and show that help is 
available through health and counseling 
services. said Murphy. He says his focus 
remains on educational programs as 
prevention.
In the past, long, structured lectures 
have been offered but have had poor turn 
outs. You cant afford to pat yourself on 
the back if you lecture to fifteen students 
for an hour and a half every month. 
Murphy says.
Two opening programs are targeted to
expose more students to educational 
programs, says Murphy.
One program will consist of a ten to fif
teen minute presentation, which will be 
followed by a ten to fifteen minute dis
cussion. It will address topics such as 
AIDS, sexually transmitted diseases, 
alcohol, and drugs, and will be presented 
to various student organizations during 
regular meetings.
The second is the Phantom lecture 
idea. It will consist of a presentation of 
about an hour that will be available to 
professors who would otherwise cancel a 
class for a particular day.
Neither Murphy nor Martin feels that 
drug use at Carnegie Mellon is any worse 
than other schools.
However, Martin comments on people 
who arent aware of drug use at Carnegie 
Mellon: Get a life... open your eyes. You 
have to know about it, at least about; 
pot.
County, University officials refute rumors of CMDS unwholesomeness
continued from page 1
Morewood Gardens, wed test for 
bacteria or parasites, and then 
Icall in the Allegheny County 
Health Department.
* In most cases, a lot of people 
would be affected, speculated 
ACHDs Christy. Thats not to 
say .that people couldnt get sick 
.alone though. She explained that, 
at times, only a very small por
tion of a prepared food might be 
affected, making it conceivable, 
but not likely, that a small num
ber of people would be affected.
Christy explained that the 
Health Department inspects fa
cilities once every six months. If 
complaints are received about an 
facility or a regular inspection 
uncovers violations, additional 
inspections are made.
The most common problem with 
facilities throughout Allegheny 
County, said Christy, involves 
keeping food at the proper tem
peratures. Other typical problems 
are improper sanitization and 
roach infestations.
The ACHD assigns a rating to 
all establishments it inspects 
based on their inspections. All 
CMDS facilities have an A rating, which means, according to 
Christy, that everythings right 
 the facility meets both food 
protection and structural require
ments.
ACHD also issues B and C 
ratings. B means that there are 
structural problems with the fa
cility and the building in which 
its housed, but all food protection 
requirements are met. With reBurglars strike residents of Morewood Gardens
continued from page 1
fled, dropping the victims wal
let. The victim was able to see 
the burglars face.
The victim called Campus Po
lice and described the burglar.
As the victim was speaking 
with a Campus Police dis
patcher, a Carnegie Mellon po
lice officer saw two men exiting 
E-Tower. One of the two fit the 
description given by the victim.
They ran from the police vehicle 
as it approached. They were pur
sued, caught, and arrested.
The man fitting the victims 
description was found with $26 
in cash, the same amount the 
victim had claimed was stolen.
The victim is considering 
pressing charges to bring the 
case into city criminal court. I 
havent really thought about it, 
said the victim. Im angry, I
want to see something done, but 
I dont want to see an example 
made of this.
In the other cases that hap
pened the same day, one person 
reported that someone entered 
her dorm room while she was 
sleeping and stole a telephone 
answering machine and atouchtone phone, and a second person 
reported that while he was ei
ther sleeping or showering,
someone removed his Walkmantype radio, a thin gold chain, and 
$16 from his dresser. Both rooms 
were unlocked at the time of the 
entry.
Campus Police refused to specu
late on any connection between 
the three robberies, which are still 
under investigation. They did, 
however, urge residents of resi
dence halls to keep their doors 
locked.
gards to C ratings, Christy said, 
You dont want to eat in a place 
with a C rating.
According to CMDS Director 
James Gurley, most management 
personnel as well as several 
hourly employees are certified in 
food-borne illness prevention by 
both the Marriott Corporation and 
the Allegheny County Health 
Department.
Gurley described several pre
cautions that CMDS takes to 
ensure that its product is whole
some. Among these precautions 
is the unannounced testing of 
products likely to be tainted by an 
independent testing lab.
We contract our vendors 
through the [Marriott] Corpora
tion, Gurley said. He explained 
that this contract contains stipulations that allow officials of 
CMDS or Marriott to inspect the1 
vendors facilities at any time.
Precautions are also built into 
everyday practices. CMDS man
agers regularly check food tem
peratures to insure that cold foods 
are kept below 45 degrees and hot 
foods are kept above 145 degrees.
It really boils down to thor
ough sanitation and proper food 
handling practices, said Gurley. 
You have to know in what tem
perature zones bacteria prolifer
ates and keep food out of those 
zones. That means keeping hot ; 
foods hot and cold foods cold.
Gurley also pointed out that ; 
quality and wholesomeness are'! 
different issues. Unpalatable is I 
not necessarily unwholesome, he  
said. !

FORUM
Carnegie's school in the 1990s
Theres no question about it. 
Carnegie Mellon is about to enter 
a new decade  and a new era.
As December winds to a close, 
the signs are everywhere: build
ings are springing up at a remark
able rate; after 18 years in office, 
President Cyert is poised to step 
down; and Faculty Senate Chair 
Volker Hartkopf is calling for a 
global approach to the 
Universitys mission, an empha
sis thats never before been really 
contemplated.
Meanwhile, Carnegie Mellon 
stands on the threshold of the 
elite few. Weve come a long way 
from the regional technical school 
we once were, but theres more to 
be done.
Change, as they say, is in the 
air, and we feel that Carnegie 
Mellon will soon have the oppor; tunity to project itself into the 
: rarified upper strata of higher edu
cation. Wed like to use our last 
editorial of the 1980s to look at 
where the University should set 
its sights for the 1990s  and 
beyond:
 Beef up financial resources.
According to a memo sent from 
Vice President for University 
I Relations Don Hale to President 
Cyert and other top administra' tors, the reason Carnegie Mellon 
was not rated as one of U.S. News 
and World Reports top 25 univer
sities recently is because of our 
low ranking in financial resources, 
which includes endowment, in
come, and library resources allo
cated per student.
To be a top university, you need 
economic clout  and the simple 
fact is that CMUs endowment is 
pretty puny. Economic clout would 
have allowed us to move more 
boldly ahead on the Pittsburgh 
Technology Center and the Uni
versity Center, to name just two 
projects.
Increase library holdings. 
Weve all heard how President 
Cyert put Carnegie Mellon on the 
map by comparative advantage 
 emphasizing those areas in 
which he felt CMU already held a 
strategic lead.
Unfortunately, this strategy has 
combined with the presence of two 
nearby world class libraries, The 
Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh 
and Pitts library system, to keep 
our own library holdings small. 
But theres no getting around it 
top universities have top librar
ies, and an investment in CMUs
library holdings could only be 
considered an investment in our 
image.
Fix fraternity housing. In
addition to being some of our most 
prominently-positionedbuildings, 
the fraternity houses are our worst 
eyesore. Carnegie Mellon students 
often come back from trips to other 
schools with stars in their eyes. 
You should see the mansions their 
fraternities have, they exclaim.
Meanwhile, our own houses are 
falling down. Perhaps the solu
tion is to allow the Greeks to move 
off campus, like at some other 
schools; in addition to solving the 
housing problem and strengthen
ing the Greek system, it would 
free useful space. Whatever the 
solution, we shouldnt try to make 
the buildings last through the 
1990s  theyre barely standing 
after the 80s.
Examine the quality of stu
dent life. After it was identified 
as a problem in the mid-80s, Presi
dent Cyert formed the Task Force 
on the Quality of Student Life. It 
was that commissions report, 
presented in November 1987, 
which motivated the University 
Center.
Even after the Center is con
structed, we shouldnt put quality 
of student life on the back burner. 
After all, the 1987 report men
tioned more than just the Univer
sity Center. The Task Force was a 
good idea in the 80s, and it will be 
a good ideain the 90s. Some things 
just get better with time.
Take the long view. At an 
institution with as long a life span 
as a university, having a building 
last only 30 years, like Skibo, is 
untenable.
In Doherty Hall, for example, 
we have a building built to last a 
centuryand it has. You can feel 
the impressions worn by years of 
traffic on the stairs. The recent 
round of construction has set a 
positive tone, and were hopeful 
that the new dorm will last long 
enough to develop impressions in 
its staircases.
The lesson here is clear: Instead 
of slapping the quick fix on ev
ery problem, Carnegie Mellon. 
needs to look for long-lasting solu
tions to its problems. Harvard 
University recently celebrated its 
350th birthday, and as one of the 
countrys foremost schools, Car
negie Mellon should plan to grow, 
prosper, and excel for that long, as 
well.

Cyert watched the Wall come down
The text of this column comes from a 
letter written by President Cyert to the 
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette upon his re
turn from West Germany. It appeared in 
the November 25 issue.
Editor:
On the evening of November 8, my 
wife and I flew into Stuttgart with Eliza
beth Bailey, dean of Carnegie Mellon 
Universitys graduate business school. 
We were in West Germany to explore an 
important research relationship be
tween our University and a major Ger
man company.
At first, this goal monopolized my 
thoughts, but we were all soon to be 
witnesses to a historic occasion. On 
November 10, the Berlin Wall was 
breached and people from East and West 
Germany were united  physically, if 
not politically  as one people again.
The West German business leaders I 
was working with were as surprised as 
we were. No one had expected this 
monumental symbol of Communism to 
crumble so suddenly. Everyone agreed 
that the opening of the Berlin Wall was 
a tribute to the might of the people of 
Communist East Germany.
We Americans were curious about the 
feelings and thought of the West Ger
mans in reaction to the growing influx of 
East German citizens. Some West Ger
mans did seem to resent this invasion, 
seeing it as a threat to their personal
Richard Cyert
economic power. They dreaded the neces
sity to share their wealth with a larger 
group of people I expect to hear louder 
protests from this group, especially in 
reaction to West Germanys relatively 
generous treatment of incoming East
erners.
But the majority of the West Germans 
strongly favored the new freedom of their 
brothers and sisters and welcomed them 
into their country. Economically, this 
group saw the migration as a boom for 
West Germany in the long run. East 
German workers possess skills and disci
pline that can be used in a West German 
economy that has very little unemploy
ment.
Although the East Germans are not 
used to operating the advanced technol
ogy represented in the West German 
factories, the basic aptitude and intelli
gence are present and there is confidence 
that the East German worker will con
tribute to the West German work force.
Another member of the Carnegie Mel
lon faculty, Fritz Prinz, professor of 
mechanical engineering and director of 
the Engineering Design Research Cen
ter, was in West Berlin, where all the 
glory and drama was unfolding.
Fritz told me about a conversation he 
had with a West Berlin cab driver days
before the wall came down. As must be 
common for visitors to this city, Fritz 
asked the cabbie how long the Berlin 
Wall would stand. I dont know, said 
the driver, Maybe months, maybe dec
ades, considering its history.
Six months ago, this conversation 
might have ended here, but after 
moment or two, the cabbie continued, 
But you know, for months ago I never 
would have expected the hard-fine gov
ernment to be ousted from East Ger
many. With all of the surprises going an 
in the Communist world today, who 
knows? Maybe the Wall will be gone 
tomorrow.
On Friday morning, the Berlin Wall 
disappeared.
Many Berliners consider this the mo^t 
exciting event since the end of World 
War II. They admire the East Germans 
discipline and patience, as they wagedia 
determined but peaceful demonstration 
whose persistenceleft the Communist 
Party with no choice but capitulation.
Others, who are disillusioned by tgo 
many unkept promises from the Ea$, 
are skeptical and fear that somewhere 
somebody may be planning a Chinese 
solution to this outcry of the peoples 
will.
To all of us American witnesses, it v 
thrilling to see the excitement of the 
German people on the streets of Berlin 
and Stuttgart, even in the press and qp 
television.
Artists work needs respect from school
Editor:
I am writing in response to a specific 
problem that some art students, includ
ing myself, have had recently. It is a 
problem that has existed as long as art 
which is a lack of understanding and 
respect for artwork; however, I would 
like to make people aware of this by 
using some recent examples on campus.
A classmate of mine did an installa
tion piece in the first floor of CFA, which 
was intentionally damaged by a faculty 
member of the Music Department. I did 
an installation in the basement of 
Doherty Hall, and my work was also 
damaged. Jessica Caplan had to put up
Letters to the Editor
with a lot of abuse when she displayed 
her now-infamous performance piece. I 
believe that such treatment of artwork 
should be taken seriously and should not 
be tolerated.
Art is not limited to paintings and 
sculptures. The world is changing and art 
is changing right along with it. New art 
forms are always being created, and some 
of them take some getting used to.
I realize that when an artist displays 
his or her work in a public area, her she
takes the risk of having his or her work 
damaged in some way. After all, acci
dents do happen. However, there is  
difference between accidental and inten
tional damage; the behavior of that music 
faculty member, the careless people who 
viewed my installation, and the indi
viduals who spewed insults at Jessica 
without realizing what her piece was 
about, is despicable. Even if apprecia
tion may be too much to ask of some 
people, I dont think tolerance and un
derstanding is.

Help decrease the crime rate in Oakland
Editor:
This letter is a plea for help to all 
students living in the Oakland area or 
who have friends residing in Oakland.
There has been an unbelievable rise 
in the crime rate in Oakland, which has 
resulted in an unbelievably high bur
glary rate. Many students living in
apartments here are being victimized and 
the city has not responded by providing 
the adequate police protection that is so 
desperately needed.
WE NEED TO ENLIST YOUE HELP 
IN STOPPING THESE CRIMES! Please 
help by signing our petition or attending 
a City Council meeting to get the city to
have walking patrolmen here.
Please stop by our office at 321 Melwood Street, Apt. 204, Oakland, or call 
621-7411 for more details. Thank you for 
your help.

Circumcision is too brutal to be continued
Editor:
Another election comes and goes, and 
once again, I chose not to participate.
How can I vote for individuals that 
advocate this barbaric and sadistic sys
tem of injustice?
Who has more rights than a newborn 
human? Yet they are treated with a total 
lack of respect and understanding.
Who has the right to cut off part of a 
babys body through unneeded and 
harmful surgery? This society seems 
to think thats OK. Its the circumcise 
because thats how we were treated at
titude. Dont look at this mentally sick 
act for what it is. Only try to justify the 
action because it is being done.
A complete cessation of this butchery 
called circumcision, unless 100 percent 
medically needed would be a first step 
toward becoming really civilized. The 
decision to circumcise a child or an adult 
has got to be taken out of the jurisdiction 
of individual physicians and parents. 
Personal prejudice and biases overshadow 
the individuals right to a complete physi
cal system.
This talk about human rights and free
dom is just an ugly mask covering the 
abuses and insults shown toward the 
children and the uninformed who have 
been tricked into thinking circumcision 
has merit.
We live under a system whose laws
hinder a childs chances of growing up to 
being mentally healthy.
An unnatural situation, circumcision, 
has been allowed to escalate, and look at 
the results: the most sexually weak coun
try in human history.
All the so-called experts will discuss 
this issue for years to come while the kids 
will continue to be subjected to this savr 
age brutality known as the land of the 
free, governed by a system based on > 
lack of decency and heaped in pile of 
egotistical fanaticism.
Do you still wonder why I dont vote?,

The 80s decade is one to remember
Even though the decade isnt 
quite over, some historians are 
ready marking these past ten 
years as important, even going as 
far as marking 1988 as pivotal a 
year as 1968. Looking back on it 
all, what really happened?
The continuing decline of the 
executive branch of the govern
ment accelerated. Going down
hill since 1968, the decline re
ceived a big push from the Re
agan era. Ushering in the prac
tices of negative advertising and 
government by fantasy, it was 
eight years of self-parody dis
guised as government. The Re
agan Revolution set the stage for 
George, whos only real act as 
president has been passing legis
lation that infringes on freedom 
of expression. We sit here, watch1 mg the world change around us, 
worrying about one person burn
ing a flag.7 The acronym HTV+ killed 
 ittany remnants of the sexual revo
lution. That same acronym also 
introduced new standards for suf'lering and compassion, and para

But, through time, Oliver Stone,

El Salvador is to be lauded on its 
ongoing fight against the FMLN
There comes a time when it is 
appropriate to congratulate cer
tain individuals and govern
ments for their stalwart actions 
and deeds. I may add that it is 
also important to show appro
bation for those remaining reso
lute and steadfast during trying 
times.
So, what am I talking about? 
Specifically, I think that the 
Salvadoran government de
serves a great deal of credit for 
staunchly fighting the communist-backed Farabundo Marti 
Liberacin National (FMLN). 
But, as seen over the past two 
weeks, debate has arisen over 
continued United States fund
ing and support of the Salva
doran government.
Recently, six Jesuit priests 
were killed by a small group of 
Salvadoran troops, and with 
that, anti-Salvadoran leftists 
here in the U.S seized the op
portunity to demand that our 
legislature negate their decision 
to continue funding.
The killing of the Jesuit 
priests was reprehensible, but 
rest assured that those respon
sible will be brought to trial by 
the Salvadoran government. 
More importantly, even though 
the killing of the priests was 
barbaric, it would be even more 
barbaric to cease funding and 
allow the murderous FMLN to 
continue its killing spree.
Isnt it ironic that when the 
FMLN murders civilians whom 
it claims collaborate with the 
Salvadoran government, de
stroys small villages for the
Dave Schwartz
reason and, as of recently, when 
the FMLN violently seized the 
hotel were U.S. troops where 
staying, U.S. leftists didnt utter 
a semblance of condemnation?
Thus, I congratulate the El 
Salvadoran government, under 
President Christiani, for its con
certed effort in fighting the con
tinuing resistence of the Nicara
guan/Cuban backed Marxist 
FMLN.
Many leftists claim that the 
FMLN has been trying to press 
for a peace initiative to end the 
fighting, but if this so, why does it 
continue to gratuitously accept 
military aid from Nicaragua and 
Cuba, aid which is used to mur
der civilians and continue the 
fighting? Apparently, the FMLNs 
desires for peace are nothing but 
public relations ploys to ingrati
ate itself with its Marxist ilk in 
the U.S, while allowing them to 
keep up the offensive.
The unfortunate result is that 
leftists in the U.S. believe the 
propaganda that the FMLN 
spumes out! Then, our fine leftwing friends share their newly 
acquired knowledge with us, for 
instance, in their literature that 
we see across campus.
An example of this leftist propa
ganda occurs when the so-called 
tours of the Central American 
region are held. The left-wing 
organizations that receive spon
sorship (by certain organizations 
who usually remain anonymous)
for these tours claim that you 
will see first-hand the so-called 
atrocities committed by the 
Nicaraguan freedom fighters 
(as an example) and the Salva
doran government. Of course 
these leftist groups neglect to 
show you the murders and dev
astations wrought by Sandinista troops along the Honduran 
border, or the terrorist assaults 
launched by the FMLN. The 
leftists objective is to show you 
only what they want you see. 
The situation isnt ominous, 
though, for there are support
ers of both the Nicaraguan 
Freedom Fighters and the El 
Salvadoran government in the 
U.S. as well.
The impetus for continued 
funding of the Salvadoran gov
ernment remains strong; pri
marily because of the many U.S. 
supporters, both citizens and 
Senators, such as Sen. Heinz, 
whose support for the Salva
doran government is adamant. 
Thus, Congress and President 
Bush should corroborate the 
wishes of U.S. citizens and El 
Salvadoran citizens alike by 
continuing to supply economic 
and military aid to El Salvador, 
and refusing to be swayed by 
the scurrilous activities of a few 
left-wingers.
The democratic El Salvadoran 
government must remain 
strong and the Nicaraguan 
Freedom Fighters must con
tinue their fight for democracy.

On a given day, I talk to an incredibly varied array of people  from writers to 
developers, testers to marketers, upper management to end users, and everyone has 
an opinion. Its my job to mold the opinions, tradeoffs and ideas into a product.

Tis the

Art Buchwald
My wife and I bought this little 
savings and loan bank as a side
line in case the column ever went 
sour. It was a mom-and-pop op
eration, and we never loaned more 
than $580 million to one customer.
Most of it went to my brotherin-law Siegfried, who ran a drycleaning establishment on Wis
consin Avenue. Siegfried needed 
the money to construct a 100-acre 
housing community for Washing
ton consultants, who now num
ber about three million.
The mom-and-pop S&L was 
doing fine, particularly since we 
paid twice as much interest to our 
depositors as any savings institu
tion inside the Beltway.
Then Siegfried fell on hard 
times. The development was con
structed on radon. Siegfried built 
24 lighted baseball diamonds, only 
to discoverthatmost Washington 
consultants preferred golf. To save 
money, Siegfried eliminated all 
the bathrooms. This slowed down 
rentals, and pretty soon Siegfried 
had no cash to pay his loans.
I said to my wife, Momma, I 
think we're in trouble. We cant 
keep paying 20 percent interest if 
no one honors his debts.
You can say that again, Poppa. 
It seems to me that the only busi
nesslike thing to do is have Washington bail us out.
Do you think they will? 
Thats what the government is 
for. An S&L cant function unless 
there is someone there to pick up 
the pieces.
So I went down to the Senate 
Office Building and told the re
ceptionist, I am here to get bailed 
out for a series ofiffy loans I made 
to members of my family.
She told me, Im sure that the 
senator will be happy to see you. 
How many tables are you buying 
for his birthday party next week? 
How many do you suggest? 
If I were trying to keep my 
savings and loan institution 
afloat, I would purchase at least 
10 at $10,000 table.
A few minutes later, the sena
tor came out of his office, drag
ging a man by his collar. He threw 
him out the door and shouted, 
Dont come back until you give to 
my Honesty in Government Po
litical Action Committee.
He ushered me in. Id like to 
call in four of my senatorial col
leagues to hear your story.
Do I give them a check now or 
later? I inquired.
Its up to you. None of us is 
pushy.
The four other senators arrived 
;and we sat around discussing my 
bailout. When I told them that I 
had used a lot of money to fix up 
my horse farm and the banking 
commissioners were looking into 
it, they became enraged. How 
'dare they get on your back for 
that?
; I agreed. Im a good constitu
ent. I give to senators whether 
they ask me or not.
The five assured me there was 
nothing to worry about. If any 
heads rolled, they would be those 
of the commissioners who had 
never given to a political cam
paign in their lives.

Letter to the Editor
Editor:
We would like to clarify what 
was reported in the last issue of 
The Tartan concerning SDC Sat
urday night films. On Wednes
day, November 15, prior to The 
Tartan article [DH 2210 movies 
marred by disorderly conduct, 
11/21] Bonnie Gorman and Anne 
Witchner of Student Affairs, 
Adam Goldsmith and Rob Bethge 
of Activities Board, and Bryan 
Wong of SDC met to discuss the 
recent vandalism that occurred 
after the showing of a film in DH 
2210, as well as concerns of alco
hol and overcrowding.
As a result of both meetings, 
several suggestions were made:
To introduce stricter regula
tion on the number of tickets sold.
To start an awareness pro
gram using flyers and posters to 
inform the students about their 
behavior during the films.
To suggest that security as
sist the ticket takers to monitor 
students entering and leaving 
films.
in DH 2210
To have AB and SDC cooper, 
ate in handling this matter to 
enhance the benefit for students 
These suggestions were acted 
upon immediately by SDC and 
AB. That weekend, the following 
policy was instituted:
The number of people to bt 
admitted to a film was limited to 
270, the maximum seating ca. 
pacity in DH 2210.
The ticket takers were in 
structed to call security immediately if any problems occurred.
 Security was sent a schedult
and was requested to monitor the
flow of students entering and 
leaving the films.
We are writing this letter be. 
cause we want students to under
stand the SDC is concerned win 
any problems that occur with the 
films shown in DH 2210. SDC 
tries to inform campus organizai 
t*ons of the discussions that oo 
cur during general meeting bj 
distibuting the SDC minutes.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  5 December 1989
One of the first things I learned 
I n Boy Scouts was that the ability 
to vote is both a right and a privi
lege. I hope my Scoutmaster 
doesnt find out, but I didnt vote 
in this semesters Senate elec
tions.
If theres safety in numbers, Im 
n good shape; 90 percent of the 
student body either didnt know 
about or didnt care about the 
elections. Seems like theres a lot 
more interest in free elections in 
Eastern Europe these days than 
in Oakland.
Its rather embarrassing for me 
that I didnt vote. Last fall, I re
ceived, both votes from GSIA. I 
even got one vote this time around. 
Three more and I could have re
claimed my seat in Senate.
Apathy in graduate colleges like 
"GSIA, SCS, and SUPA is easy to 
explain. Senate only controls 63% 
of our Activities Fee, and most 
students from these colleges have 
'little contact with the under
graduate student body save for 
Hunt Library, Skibo, and Salads 
Plus.
Who cares about student apathy?
Stewart Levine
However, the undergraduate 
turnout was not much better. 
Theres an eight-way tie for sec
ond place in CFA, which Senate 
will have to resolve. Each candi
date received one vote.
Could it be that people just 
arent taking Senate seriously? I 
cant believe that this would be 
the case, even though attending 
some meetings can get you think
ing that way.
The typical Senate meeting has 
a segment of audience participa
tion: a chance for the three regu
lar members of the audience  
The Tartans reporter, the Stu
dent Union's reporter, and Dean 
Murphy to speak. The only oth
ers who typically attend are stu
dents whose organizations want 
money.
Unfortunately, the typical Sen
ate meeting lacks the two things 
which normally draw a crowd at 
Carnegie Mellon: pizza and beer.
Pizza at every meeting would 
quickly take away whatever is 
left of this years Activities Fee, 
and it would take quite an end 
run around CMUs alcohol policy 
to have Senate start serving by 
the keg.
This unfortunately still leaves 
us in a bind; Senate is spending 
the Activities Fee (as it is supposedto) andno one knows where.
I often wonder what would 
happen if The Tartan and Stu
dent Union stopped going to the 
meetings: Would Senate cease to 
exist and the budgets of funded 
organizations just magically re
ceive money every year?
In any case, the new Senators 
will claim their seats tonight at 7 
pm in the Wherrett Room, if they 
know to show up. Where will I be? 
I dont know, but Im a hypocrite; 
I know I wont be there.

LEAPERSHIP
Its that time of the year once again
Do you remember the first time 
it would snow each year when you 
were a kid? Youd wake up at 6 am 
(gee, it must have really been a 
long time ago), and run into your 
parents room, shouting, Its 
snowing! Its snowing! If it were 
a weekend, you would already be 
dressed and ready to go outside 
and play. If it were a weekday, 
you would sit in front of the TV 
and pray with all your might that 
you would not have school. When 
these hopes disappeared you 
would gloomily skulk back to your 
room to finish getting ready for 
school. But if you happened to get 
lucky, a great day lay ahead.
You could not, however start 
the day immediately. You had to 
wait until Mom or Dad was ready 
to come down and serve you a 
healthy breakfast and make sure 
that you really ate your vitamin. 
Andthen youhadtohelp cleanup
 something you despised, but 
did anyway just so you could go 
outside. The sun was starting to 
rise, making the snow look even 
more inviting, and you were itch
ing to go.
But no, you were still notready. 
It was time to do all of your bur
densome chores, such as making 
your bed or emptying the waste
baskets. You rushed through all 
of your work, and set a new world 
record  three minutes and 47 
seconds. Mom, being the smart 
lady she was, suspected that you 
did not do a thorough job, and 
wentupstairs to check. Ifyou surSue Abrams
prised her, your chances of get
ting outside before the day was 
over were getting better and bet
ter, but if she was right, you would 
have to go through the. whole 
process again, wasting even more 
time.
Kin I go? Kin I go? you asked 
for what seems like the zillionth 
time. Of course you can go now. 
That is, after you were properly 
dressed. You were not, I repeat, 
you were not, allowed to step out
side the door without a hat, mit
tens, scarf, two sweaters, longjohns, extra-heavy socks, your 
heavy (and usually ugly) boots, 
sweatpants, jeans, and snowpants, not to mention your coat. 
This all took plenty of time to put 
on, no matter how fast you went, 
because you never knew what to 
put on first. Plus, the more you 
put on, the harder it was for you 
to walk, let alone move.
So you were all dressed and 
ready to face the bitter cold. You 
burst out the back door, scream
ing Yippee!!!, but less than a 
second later, Mom called you back 
in to remind you that the neigh
bors were still sleeping, so keep 
the noise level down. Youre back 
outside again, starting to load up 
on your supply of snowballs be
fore the otherkids came out. All of 
a sudden, you realized that you 
could notbreathe!Time to go back
in and have Mom help you blow 
your nose.
Then it was time to go to the 
bathroom. And time for lunch. 
And time to talk to a friend on the 
phone. And time to bombard the 
neighborhood children with your 
skillfully crafted snowballs from 
behind your strongfort. And time 
to change some of your clothing. 
And time to get some hot choco
late. And time to go to the bath
room. And time to get ready for 
dinner. It almost seemed as 
though you spent more time in
side than out. Yet nevertheless, 
you still had a lot of fun.
That was when we were grow
ing up. Will it be any different for 
the new generation of the upcom
ing decade? Probably not. We will 
still make them bundle up before 
they can go out and have fun. And 
they will have just as much fun as 
we did (perhaps even more due to 
newer technology) running back 
and forth from the house to the 
fort.
Im really loooking forward to 
the first snow at home over vaca
tion, goofing off with my neigh
bors, and practically gettingkilled 
by their snowballs. I dont care 
how silly it makes me look, either, 
because its a lot of fun. Besides, 
youre never too old to still be a 
kid at heart.

place. . .and even developing 
products that easily hook up 
with systems outside the 
IBM environment.
So you always thought IBMers were 
a bunch of blue striped suits 
with buttoned down minds. . ,
Nothing could be further '
from the truth.
Theyre movers and shakers.
Energetic, ambitious and smart. People 
who know where theyre going and 
get there fast. People with ideas who choose 
IBM because they know their ideas will 
be heard and put into action.
Thats right. The winds of change are 
sweeping the vast corporate infrastructure of 
IBM. Todays IBM is a leaner, more streamlined 
operation that reacts more quickly. Weve broken 
through the layers of bureaucracy to create a 
company that takes more risks... is closer to 
the customer... and encourages IBMers to 
speak up, challenge old ways of thinking 
and initiate new ideas.
This is not a company that simply rests on its 
past successes. Were sharing our blueprint for the 
future with both our staff and competitors.
Weve become more robust.
I see unlimited 
opportunities for 
advancement at 
IBM.. .both in the 
technical and 
managerial ranks.
We have our share of 
technical challenges 
and our share of the 
right people to meet 
them. Professionals 
who are committed 
to quality and excel
lence in all they do. 
And by the way, 
they know how to 
have fun too.

Diversity applauded. And management is openminded, progressive and responsive.
At IBM, you'll be at the heart of the informa

the responsibility you can handle. Work in small 
project teams with the newest computer-aided 
equipment. Involved in technologies that range 
from image processing to laser-fiber optics. . . 
from robotics and computer controlled
At IBM I can be 
a systems engineer,

engineer, specialist or 
generalist... all with 
the same company.
Where the people are 
high achievers with big

information technologies. . .and working 
alongside some of the industrys brightest 
programmers, engineers and scientists 
in all fields.
Youll earn early recognition and have the 
opportunity for exposure to multiple projects. At 
IBM, no idea is too small to reach managements 
ear and get quick response.
Youll have plenty of room to grow because 
were a company that promotes from within. 
IBMers have the option to move from one area to 
another.. .to relocate to a variety of sites... 
and to follow a career track along purely 
technical lines or into management. All the 
while moving up just as fast and as far as 
your talenf will take you.
Your education doesnt end when you get a 
job at IBM. It just begins. Our training facilities 
are tops. And at every location, we sponsor 
numerous workshops, seminars, symposiums 
and lectures to keep you technologically fit.
In addition, IBMers are encouraged to avail 
themselves of a wide variety of educational 
programs to enhance their present job 
performance, meet future challenges and 
achieve their long-range career goals.

The thing that 
gets me going 
the most is the 
possibilities, the 
endless possibilities. 
This is a company 
where I can, within 
reason, call my own 
shots about my 
future. If I want to 
develop a career as 
a top-level IBM 
manager, I can do 
that. If I want to 
become an IBM 
Fellow eventually, I 
can make that hap
pen too. Career 
development at 
IBM is primarily 
the responsibility of 
the individual; the 
manager is there to 
facilitate and coun

degree of control 
over my own future 
career is exciting.

The most exciting 
thing about IBM is 
that were trying to be 
a different company than we 
were ten years ago, or even last 
year. There are opportunities for 
making change happen. Ive 
had both increasing respon

as the years progressed, in an 
increasing variety of roles.

temporary assignments within or outside IBM.
And theres more. IBM encourages its family 
of professionals to exceed their own expectations. 
At all levels, IBMers may receive recognition 
and financial awards for outstanding contri
bution, innovation and technical achieve
ment. Recognition coupled with the 
prestjige of meeting and exceeding 
unusual challenges keep both IBM and 
its people growing and moving ahead.
Never has there been a more exciting time to 
join IBM. Every day were growing and changing, 
keeping ahead of the most rapid technological 
changes. And this means greater challenge and 
fast-paced career mobility for you in development,

of accomplishment and self-fulfillment that 
sparks new ideas and keeps you growing, 
step into IBM. You and your career will never

Olympics in 
ittsburgh?
As I looked through the latest 
*and-McNally city rankings, a 
bought struck me: could any of 
he top 10 cities handle an 
vent like the Olympics?
I bring this up now because, 
elieve it or not, the 
itemational Olympic 
lommittee (IOC) is looking over 
small list of possible sites for 
ie 1996 Summer Games.We 
bould be interested since 
ittsburgh is not one of the 
ities on the list, at least not 
-et.
Melbourne, Australia; Athens, 
Greece; and Atlanta, Georgia 
re the leading contenders. The 
ames have not been held in 
Athens for several decades, and 
lany Olympic purists think the 
lummer Games should be held 
here permanently. But, 
urprisingly enough, Atlanta, 
feorgia appears to be the 
urrent frontrunner for 96.
1 was in Atlanta for 
hanksgiving Break and the 
ity is going all out to impress 
he IOC. City government, local 
usiness leaders, and average 
itizens are all rallying to get 
he games. Atlanta enjoyed the 
irestige and notoriety it 
eceived from the 1988 
)emocratic Convention, and the 
ity is hungry for more.
The reason CMU should be 
oncerned is that one of the 
chools rivals  academically if 
ot athletically  is fixin to 
enefit greatly if Atlanta gets 
tie games. The Georgia Tech 
ampus will be the Olympic 
illage and will get some great 
ew stuff to accommodate the 
itemational athletes. New 
)rms, dining halls, and 
;udent centers, not to mention 
;hletic facilities, will be built 
or the Olympics which Tech 
.udents will benefit from once 
ie games end.
Another academic rival (as 
ell as athletic), Emory 
niversity, will also benefit, 
tudents will be hob-nobbing 
ith people from all over the 
orld in local beer-joints. The 
rm International Night 
ould take on a whole new 
leaning.
Why cant Pittsburgh get the 
lympics? CMU could easily 
)n the city out of some money 
>r new dorms, the semilusionary University Center, 
tod a gym that isnt a joke. 
Imagine partying at PHI with 
ussian weightlifters, or getting 
inters from the British 
wing team over tea. I would 
ve to take a member of the 
olish team down to the 
riginal Hot Dog Stand so I 
uld get an informed opinion 
j)out what makes a good 
^usage sandwich.
Pittsburgh would be a great 
ace to have the Olympics, 
us city has ethnic areas that 
>uld ma^e many of the foreign 
hletes feel as though they had 
;ver left home.
Finally lets mpare what
2 opening ceremonies would 
Ijke. In Atlanta, planning 
airman may say something 
;e, I would like to welcome 
ill to the Atlanta games.
n Pittsburgh we could hear 
Wething much more

Women continue streak, 
beating Emory and NYU
By JASON MCDONALD
Tartan Senior Staffwriter
NEW YORKThe Tartans extended their winning streak to 
six games in dramatic fashion as they beat the Violets of New 
York University in a 60-57 overtime decision.
We looked tired out there, remarked head coach Gerri Seidl. 
It was our first real test since Brandeis, and we were on our 
first two-game road trip of the year.
After an eighteen-minute delay brought about by a malfunc
tioning scoreboard, the teams traded baskets for the first ten 
minutes. A pair of travelling calls in the Tartans offensive zone 
meant the difference early as the Violets pushed ahead, 1412.
The Tartans were able to hold tough and retake the lead over 
the next few minutes. A pair of baskets by Katie Fahey and 
missed foul shot opportunities by the Violets gave CMU a 22-21 
lead.
With time running out, NYUs Beth LiVolsi hit a pair of foul 
shots, but Lisa Smith hit the only CMU three-pointer of the 
game to return the lead to the Tartans. Amy Buxbaum finished 
out the scoring, beating the buzzer and completing the threepoint play to give the Tartans a 28-23 halftime lead. Buxbaum

NYU and Emory cant 
change the mens luck
By STEWART LEVINE
Tartan Managing Editor
NEW YORK  The 1989-90 mens basketball season is 
looking more and more like a repeat of last season. The Tartans 
have now dropped their first six games of the season for the 
second year in a row.
The Tartans dropped four games over the last two weeks to 
fall to 0-6,0-5 in the University Athletic Association. Rebound
ing, has become a major weakness, with Point Park, Emory, 
and New York University each scoring in triple digits against 
Carnegie Mellon.
With one game to go before winter break, several weaknesses 
have become apparent. We need to work on our defense and 
rebounding, said Head Coach Larry Anderson.
The Tartans are adjusting to the loss of two-thirds of last 
years front court to graduation. Against Rochester and Emory, 
freshmen Charlie Connors and Kenyatte Mason started along
side senior captain Chris Luckett. Both have shown flashes of 
brilliance, but at other times have made freshman mistakes.
Luckett also feels that the team needs a lot of work over 
winter break. We need a lot of work on basic fundamentals.

Swim teams make a splash as men 
win and women lose to Westminster
The womens swim team dives off to the gun in 
Wednesdays meet against Westminster College.
By ALIM RAY
Tartan Staffwriter 
& KATIE CULBERTSON
Tartan Assistant Sports Editor
The CMU swim teams had their first and last dual 
meets of the season Wednesday against the Westmin
ster Titans.
Coach Bruce Bronsdon was surprised with the close 
meets his teams had; the men won 109-95 and the 
women lost 96-104. Bronsdon described it as one of the 
meets where every swim makes a difference. Two
weeks ago Westminster held a relay tournament where 
the Tartans were beaten badly by the Titans.
This was really a team effort all the way, said 
Brondson. It was close from start to finish.
Bronsdon believes Carnegie Mellon did much better 
against Westminster this time because the Tartans 
needed less depth in this meet. He had some of his 
swimmers compete in back-to-back events to try to 
maximize points.
For this reason, some of the swimmers times were not 
up to the usual standards. Nevertheless, sophomore 
Brian Zimmerman pulled two first places in back-toback events for the Tartans.
Senior Pat Hensler won the 200-meter individual 
medley, junior Paul Moran pulled first place in the 200- 
meter backstroke, and freshman Jamie Millar won the 
200-meter breaststroke.
The mens meet was very close to the end, said 
Brondson, who attributes the win to the Tartans strength 
in some events at the end that clinched the win for us. 
Also, the Tartans were able to place with some depth, 
receiving points for more than just first place, which can 
make quite a difference in close meets.
Its very deceiving to have just a lot of first places, 
said Brondson. You can win almost all the races but 
lose the meet if you cant place second, third, fourth, of
fifth.
In the womens meet, the Tartans were ahead up to 
the last relay, which really should not have happened, 
since we arent that strong, said Brondson.
For the women, sophomore Glynnis Frost clinched the 
1000 meter, sophomore Jo Wollschlaeger won the 200- 
meter individual medley, the 200-meter butterfly, and 
the 200-meter breaststroke, senior Francesca Crannell 
took first in the 100-meter freestyle, and sophomore 
Missy Van Royen won the 200-meter backstroke.
The last competition of the semester for the Tartans 
was a University Athletic Association Invitational at 
Case Western Reserve University.
Wollschlaeger made an impressive showing for both 
herself and Carnegie Mellon, winning the 400-meter 
individual medley 4:42.10, the 200-meter breaststroke 
2:34.06, and the 200-meter butterfly 2:11.98. Her win
ning times in the individual medley and the butterfly 
qualified Wollschlaeger fortheNCAADivision III Cham
pionships.
After the meet at Case, the mens UAA standings are 
Emory, 248; New York University, 92; Case Western 
Reserve 91; Carnegie Mellon, 68; and Rochester 46.
The womens standings are Emory, 210; Rochester, 
110; New York University 76; Carnegie Mellon, 73; and 
Case Western Reserve, 50.
Psyched for snow, ski team begins season
By KELLY WALSH
Tartan Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon ski team 
will take to the slopes in January 
for its first year of competition, 
under coach and coordinator Mike 
Barmada.
The team, now an official 
member of the National Colle
giate Ski Association, will be 
competing against various schools 
in Pennsylvania, Maryland, and 
West Virginia, as well as mem
bers of the Allegheny College Ski 
Conference. The ski conference 
includes such schools as Pitt, Penn 
State, University of Pennsylva
nia, Duquesne, and Albright Col
lege.
Rankings of the teams are based 
on individual and team scoring.
The top four mens and womens 
A-teams and the top five individ
ual A-teams in each conference 
qualify for regionals. From there, 
the top three teams in each cate
gory go on to national competi
tion.
Id really like to make it to 
National Championships, said 
Barmada, who has four years of 
racing experience. We really 
have a lot of good racers.
The teams home slopes are at 
Hidden Valley ski resort in Som
erset, Pennsylvania, where it will 
practice with three coaches, in
cluding Barmada and an instruc
tor from Hidden Valley. Training 
begins January 15.
Competition entails five sched
uled meets, one each week, fol
lowed by a regional competition,
and finally a national competi
tion. The teams first competition 
will be January 20 at Tussey 
Mountain in State College. The 
team will continue competinginto 
February.
All of the members of the team 
will get to ski, although not all of 
the skiers will be on regionally or 
nationally ranked teams, said 
Barmada.
Carnegie Mellons teams con
sist of about 40 skiers. The mens 
and womens A-teams have five 
racers and two substitutes. The 
B-teams have an unlimited 
amount of skiers, who race at a 
less competitive level.
Each competition includes a dif
ferent ski event.
Barmadas goal? We want to 
win them all.

14The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  5 December 1989
Watching people sleep  a good indication of someones personality
By SHEILA SKAFF
Tartan Staffwriter
There.s been quite a bit of talk 
about how body language reveals 
a lot about someones personal
ity. To appear confident a person 
should assume proper posture, 
shake hands firmly, and look 
others in the eye. At the same 
time, subtle motions such as cross
ing the legs so that a foot points to 
a specific person lets them know 
you are interested. Most of this 
body language can be taught 
that is, you can easily change your 
posture to reflect what you want 
to say. But what about language 
that is subconcious, and there
fore proves a persons true emo
tional state?
To find out someones true 
emotional state, watch them 
sleep. The positions taken during 
sleep may reveal what is appar
ent, and what is hidden, during 
the waking hours.
The fetal position is one of the 
most popular. In this position legs 
are curled upwards, the back is 
rounded, and the arms are 
cuddled to create a ball shape. 
This signifies a return to the 
womb, as it is the same position 
an unborn baby takes, and it 
indicates that a person wants 
safety and security. When two 
people sleep in a double-fetal 
position, the person on the out
side is the primary nurturer, and 
the person on the inside is the 
primary dependent.
Lying in a prone position, or 
flat on the stomach, shows that a

4aLaum 2vuC ot uhhu4alCw ulr 2vuC ot 
vorral rb4ol1 Cva 2usol1 v,b4t8
person is feeling under control. 
The prone person is confident 
enough to turn their back on the 
world. Lying face down indicates 
other things; a person is truly 
able to detach himself from daily 
upsets and relax; and this person 
masks his true emotions by hid
ing his face.
A person who sleeps hanging 
off the side of the bed has a diffi
cult time asserting himself. They 
may have a very passive person
ality, as they are afraid to claim 
even a part of the bed.
On the flipside, someone who 
lies diagonally across the bed
shows a high level of assertive
ness. They want control of the 
situation.
 The workaholic will often sleep 
with one foot over the edge of the 
bed. This is proof of an active and 
energetic personone who would 
rather not take the time to sleep if 
they didnt have to. Students are 
often found in this position when 
they have huge projects due and 
are afraid that they wont finish.
The supine position is where 
the person sleeps on their back. 
The supine person feels gener
ous, and is in a very giving mood. 
This is a good time to ask for
favors, since he or she is showing 
openness and sympathy by sleep
ing in this position, and will rarely 
turn anyone down.
In a sphinx position, a person 
sleeps like a beetle, with face 
down, head resting on arms, and 
knees drawn up beneath the head. 
This person is showing fear by 
sleeping in a protective ball, as a 
shield from the outside world. 
This is usually done in response 
to some authoritative force.
A person who sleeps sittingup 
probably has difficulty relaxing. 
The position calls for a person to 
be sitting up, with their hands to 
the side and feet straight out. 
This position generally points to 
a philosophy that the person 
doesnt want to be caught lying 
down.
The fighter position means 
exactly that, the person is ready 
for combat at any time. Fists are 
always clenched, although some
times they may be hidden under a 
pillow or body to try to maintain 
some control over aggressive feel
ings. A fighter may sleep on bacj 
or side, and usually will curl the 
legs as if ready to move quickly
Unconsciously, a person w'i 
sleeps with arms or legs crosse 
is showing a desire to keep otl^ei 
out for fear of being hurt. 
crossed means fear of sexual rela 
tion, and arms crossed mean 
that the person is constraint 
emotions.
Of course there are other 
tionsthe swastika, for exampj 
in which the person assumes tha 
shape with his arms and legs; tjh 
semi-fetal position which igmilder version of the fetal; ai 
arms tucked between the leg 
which shows that a person 
protecting his private parts.
So tonight when you go to slec 
ask your roomate what positij 
you are in. It can tell you mot 
about yourself, your feelings, an 
your moods than you ever thougt 
possible.
Sheila Skaff is an undecia^ 
H&SS freshman.
Mens basketball in the cellar with no-win season
continued from page 13
Every game we do something bad. 
Man-to-man defense is one of the 
biggest [weaknesses], he said.
There are some bright spots. 
Luckett is averaging over 20 
points and over seven rebounds 
per game. The senior has led the 
Tartans in scoring.
Senior Harvey Beckham may 
be turning into another bright 
spot. After a rough start, Beck
ham came off the bench to score 
19 points against Emory to win a 
starting assignment against 
NYU. Beckham needs to play well 
to keep his job from Keith Mor
gan, who has been sidelined with 
an injury.
Harve/d been struggling, but
now hes better, said Anderson. 
We need more senior leadership, 
especially since Morgans been 
hurt.
With the mix of seniors and 
freshmen starting, the team again 
resembles last years. Last sea
son, freshmen Phil Bronner and 
Chris Dobbs started until 
Bronners season was cut short 
with an injury against Rochester. 
This season, freshman Mason has 
started every game and another 
freshman, Connors has started 
two more.
Were young  weve got to 
suck it up and play, said Ander
son.
The Tartans didnt do so well 
when they opened up at home
against cross-town rival Point 
Park College. After two encour
aging games in Boston to open 
the season, Carnegie Mellon was 
ambushed by the Pioneers, 
101-81. We started off well, we 
couldve won the first two games 
[Brandeis and Case Western 
Reserve], [but] we got beaten 
really badly by Point Park and it 
just started to snowball, said 
Luckett.
The game against Rochester 
was almost over before it began. 
The Yellowjackets jumped out to 
a 16-0 lead, and led 27-4 halfway 
through the first half and 52-16 
at the end of the first half. Roch
ester won 92-50 against Carne
gie Mellon, with the team shoot
ing an abysmal 28.6 percent from 
the floor.
Things looked brighter against 
Emory, the team picked to win 
the UAA for the second straight 
season. However, a 10 point spurt 
pulled the Eagles ahead and the 
Tartans never recovered. CMU 
turned the ball over twice as often 
as Emory in the 105-62 loss.
NYU was more of the same. 
CMU started out well, taking the 
lead several times, as the Violets 
and Tartans traded baskets. 
However, NYU put together a 
174 run late in the first half and 
never looked back. By halffcime, 
the Violets owned a 19-point lead 
and ended up beating CMU, 
100-78.

$Vomens basketball is undefeated in the first six games of the season

would lead the Tartans with sev
enteen points and nine rebounds.
Over the first thirteen minutes 
of the second half, the teams 
tattled back and forth to a 4643 
{MU leac*- Then the Violets overtOokthe Tartans, helped by clutch 
rebounding by Carrie Kaezmarslri and Liz Canino.
"'They were really good on the 
Sards, and they really seemed to 
Jant the ball more than us. They 
jiadfive going for every loose ball,
explained Seidl.
After the Tartans called time
out to regroup, they were faced 
with a48-46 deficit with lessthan 
four minutes to play. However, 
the Tartans playedtough defense, 
and Lisa Smith hit the tying 
basket with 1:05 on the clock to 
send the game to overtime, 52-52.
In overtime, the Tartans 
jumped out to a 60-55 lead. The 
Violets added a pair of foul shots 
by Kaczmarski, but were unable 
to draw closer. Only poor foul

shooting prevented the victory 
from being larger as the game 
ended, 60-57.
Two days earlier, the Tartans 
took on a young Emory team. 
Not surprisingly, the Tartans 
rolled to a 6949 victory.
The Eagles held close to the Tar
tans for the first twelve minutes, 
but CMU pulled away with a ten 
point run, led by four of Katie 
Faheys 13 first-half points thatgave 
the Tartans a 27-13 advantage with 
five minutes left in the half. Several
Tartan fouls allowed the Eagles 
to draw closer, but the first half 
ended with a commanding 32-20 
lead.
The Tartans took even more 
control in the second half as the 
team continued to play its pres
sure defense. Lisa Smith poured 
in 21 of her game-high 23 points, 
and the bench got into the action 
as Carnegie Mellon cruised to the 
6949 win.
On Tuesday, the Tartans 
crushed Lake Erie College by a
final score of88-28, and followed 
up with a 61-44 victory against 
the University of Rochester. Lisa 
Smith led the Tartan scoring in 
both games, notching 21 against 
Lake Erie and 19 against Roches
ter.
The schedule resumes with the 
Kean College Tournament on De
cember 28. Coach Seidl expressed 
some concern about the long lay
over. If they dont keep the ball 
in their hands over the break, it 
will hurt us.

Phi Kappa Theta reigns in IM minors soccer
By KATIE CULBERTSON
Tartan Assistant Sports Editor
In a championship game 
plagued by the wind, Phi Kappa 
Theta capped off a perfect season 
last Monday with a victory over 
USS Carnegie.
The 3-2 victory clinched the 
intramural minors soccer title for 
Phi Kap.
The road to the championship 
was a nearly flawless one for Phi 
Kap, which only allowed four goals 
to be scored by its opponents all 
season, two of which came in the 
final game against USS Carne
gie.
The team especially had its 
sights set on the championship, 
after losing in the finals last year.

Phi Kap lost none of its games 
in the regualr season, and de
feated Pioneers in the first round 
of the playoffs and stopped Sigma 
Tau Gamma 21 in the semi-finals to earn a spot in the champi
onship game.
In the first round of the play
offs, Pi Lambda Phi lost to USS 
Carnegie, which defeated EPP in 
the semi-finals to play Phi Kap in
the finals.
Last Mondays weather set the 
stage for a cold, windy game. 
Marty Reed of USS Carnegie 
scored first in the final game, but 
Phi Kappa Theta made a quick 
comeback on a Matt Murphy goal 
to tie the score at one all at the 
half.
In the second half, another Reed 
goal for USS Carnegie wasnt
enough to overcome two quick Phi 
Kap goals early in the half. Had 
USS Carnegie capitialized on 
some valuable opportunities, the 
outcome may have been differ
ent, but the score remained 32 to 
the end.
Matt Murphy scored two of the 
goals for Phi Kap, one on a pen
alty kick, and Paul Nagy scored 
the other point.
Despite injuries sustained by a 
team member, Phi Kap was able 
to count on the reliable playing of 
strong team members like Brad 
Hathaway on defense, Eric Helnisen as goalkeeper, Tate Kuerbis 
on offense, and Brian Bumgarner 
kept the team going throughout 
the season, said Dave Willis of 
Phi Kap.

;Its almost over, says Steve 
ardonner, I cant wait.
More than most students, Par'donner, a second-year student in 
GSIA, is looking forward to the 
end of the semester.
1- The end of the semester means 
finals and winter vacation, but 
more importantly to him, it means 
the end of the Management Game. 
Called simply Game by the stu
dents, it is a business simulation 
played by second-year masters 
students in GSIA.
In the spring of their first year, 
students elect team presidents, 
who draft six-person teams for 
the following semester. Each team 
then runs its own detergent com
pany,Brain Wash, SixGuysSoap, 
Mellon Unmatched Detergent, or 
whatever theyve named them
selves, for three months  in 
game terms three years  com
peting with each other for market 
share, bragging rights, and
Its a black hole, says Jeff 
Douglass, one of 45 team presi
dents.
AecordingtoAssistantDeanfor 
the Masters Program Valerie 
Weidman, Game is A course 
which seeks to synthesize all of 
the skills were teaching at 
GSIA.... We strive to create an 
environment which simulates 
what a top manager has to deal 
with. Were trying to give stu
dents a sense of how a variety of 
differentdisciplinesworktogether. 
to ran a country.
Game is a required class, and 
no one graduates from GSIA with
out taking it.
Game, a Carnegie Mellon crea
tion, was first played at GSIA in. 
the 1950s. The concept has since 
been copied by other business 
schools nationwide. The original 
premise has remained the same
 teams run companies through 
a combination of computer simu
lation and interaction with pro
fessionals.
Teams submit moves which 
represent a months decisions 
ranging from how much of each of 
their brands will be produced to 
salary paid to employees to 
amounts of stock purchased and 
sold to money spent on research 
and development. A day later they 
are told how they did.
At the beginning of the semes
ter, teams have one week between 
moves. By mid-November the pace 
has picked up to two moves every 
three days.
I talk to my friends at other 
business schools  they say, 
Yeah, we do a simulation too, 
but its like, No, you dont under
stand,  says Ed DeForest.
The simulation is only one part 
of the game. Each team has a 
Board of Directors to which it 
must report three times, once for 
each Game year. Board members 
range from professors to alumni 
to corporate executives from Pitts
burgh and beyond. One-fourth of 
the board members are alumni 
who played the Game. One teams 
Chairman ofthe Board commutes 
from his job'in Cincinnati for each 
board meeting. Others fly in from 
as far away as Nebraska and 
Texas.
Teams must also negotiate la
bor contracts with representatives 
from the United Steelworkers 
Union, present marketing plans 
to local marketing executives, and 
give press conferences open to the 
public.
The board meetings provide the 
greatest feedback on each teams 
performance. It comes down to 
the board. In another class you 
get a poor grade, but you dont 
have six respected members of 
the business community shout
ing at you for six hours, explains 
DeForest.
photo courtesy GSIA
To prepare for the meetings, 
teams will camp out in GSIAs 
Macintosh cluster to prepare 
slides and spend hours in meet
ings trying to get the words just 
right.
Sometimes the results from the 
board meetings can be encourag
ing. The Board has to represent 
the fictional shareholders, but also 
must keep in mind that Game is 
meant tobe aleaming experience 
for the students.
President Jim Conleys board 
explained it to him this way: Its
pnoto courtesy uaitt
A GSIA student participates in one of the three board meetings that take place throughout the project.
our company, but your game, so 
well let you screw up.
Other times the board wont be 
as courteous. Meetings can run 
for more than three hours when a 
team has to explain why it lost 
money and the share dropped 50 
percent in value.
The real world has other ways 
of popping into the Game world. 
Two weeks after the California 
earthquake, earthquakes hit the 
Western regions of all of the na
tions, disrupting operations. 
Takeover battles were won and 
lost, companies watched their 
cash disappear, and saw them
selves get stonewalled in labor 
negotiations.
Teams have to develop market
ing plans and created videotaped 
commercials, advertisement sto
ryboards, and even mock pack
ages for their detergents which 
were displayed in the halls of 
GSIA before Thanksgiving.
Teams can do anything a real 
company can, as long as Weidman 
approves. Ive encouraged any
thing Ive thought was well 
thought out, well planned, and 
executable, she says. Teams have 
access to both lawyers and bank
ers who can provide assistance as 
necessary.
In the Game world, news and 
gossip travel quickly. The ad
ministration publishes the Tech 
Street Journal, containing stock 
prices, balance sheets, and other 
corporate data, but the real 
dirt appears in the weekly, 
anonymously-written student
newsletter, Robber Barrons.
Reading Robber Barrons tells 
you which teams are meeting 
every day, which presidents are 
havingproblemswiththeirteams, 
and which teams were spotted at 
the local bars after a particularly 
rough board meeting.
The tone of Robber Barrons is 
often satirical or mocking. One 
team was admonished for work
ing on Game at a Barcrawlers, 
the colleges weekly Tuesdaynight 
meeting at a Pittsburgh bar. 
Presidents are chided for taking 
Game, or themselves, too seri
ously.
Throughout Robber Barrons 
will be complaints about time. 
Ask a second-year student what 
he or she wants most and youll 
hear more time.
Its not like taking a class. Its 
your life, says DeForest. You 
schedule other things around it
 sleep, dining, sex.... [The hard
est part] is the time. Theres no 
right answer, and keeping people 
from killing each other is key. 
John Long has a different way 
to survive: Avoiding your presi
dent like crazy helps.
Weidman feels that the stu
dents themselves cause Game to 
be so time-consuming. Many of 
the courses students take in the 
first year of the program are cen
tered around group projects that 
promote cooperation.
When you come to Game, she 
says, its one of the first times 
you see recognizable competi
tion.... Students tend to do more
photo courtesy GSIA 
than they need to because of a 
sense of a need to keep up with 
their peers.
However, after three long 
months, this years Game is at 
last winding down for the stu
dents. Last week, as one of the 
final parts of Game, press confer
ences were held. A representa
tive from each team had to face 
his classmates and the Game 
press corps  consisting of three 
members of GSIAs faculty  to 
explain his or her teams actions.
Teams had to respond to ques
tions about the games crisis, the 
explosion of a storage tank con
taining toxic waste in each 
companys plant which killed two 
workers. Other questions asked 
about a teams profitability, the 
ethics of certain business prac
tices, and what thenames of some 
of the teams meant.
Friday, the teams submitted 
their final moves. All that now 
remains is the finishing of 1991 
annual reports and the final round 
of board meetings.
For the GSIA administration, 
Game never ends. There will be 
people working on it all year 
round, says Weidman.
New enhancements will be 
made to the simulation, which 
moved to Andrew this year. Next 
year, a team will compete from a 
university in Sweden, adding an 
international flavor to Game.
The final class meets next 
Wednesday. After that, Game will 
finally be over for the GSIA Class 
of 1990.

green lights and there is no blue 
bus on the horizon. Nope, still no 
sign of the ml 04.
Well, -the dentist will have to 
wait. Sorry, Dr. Perlman I had to 
wait two days for the ml 04. By 
that time my wisdom teeth will be 
impacted. Hell need a wrecking 
ball just to loosen them. Still no 
ml 04.1 could start counting the 
cabs that pass. I could sit on the 
sidewalk, and have people think I 
am a bohemian.
Or I could lean against the bus 
stop sign, a lend of savoir faire to 
my school girl appearance. Maybe 
if I take off my shoes, lie down and 
nap, Ill make a statement. Now 
theres an idea. If only I had 
brought a book. Metropolitan 
transit should consider showing 
music videos at bus stops.
Finally, someone else is com
ing. I can hear the person walking 
up behind me. I should tell them 
theres no ml 04 running today. I 
could say. Im with the Madison 
Avenue comission, and were 
doing a little experiment with the 
ml 04. Were suspending all serv
ice for eight weeks and seeing 
just how long people are willing to 
, wait.
SPECS
Then the granny standing be
hind me would probably have a 
heart attack, and Id have to take 
her to the hospital. Sorry, Dr. 
Perlman, I wont be in today. Im 
in the emergency Room of Mount 
Sinai. There was a little accident.
Maybe the person behind me 
isnt a granny. Maybe it isnt a 
woman. Maybe its a handsome, 
young, lonely vice president of 
Merrill Lynch waiting for the bus. 
But why wouldnt he take a cab?
Because hes still struggling. 
Not having paid off the mortgage 
on his second home yet, hes quite 
conscious of the value of the dol
lar.
I always take the ml04, he 
says to his friends. I can hear his 
newspaper rustling. It sounds like 
The Wall Street Journal.
Yes, its definitely some young 
blood heading back to the office. 
His decisions regarding the trad
ing floor are probably needed 
right now. Should I turn and tell 
him? I can hear my future 
daughters tender voice: Did you 
and Daddy really meet while 
waiting for the ml 04?
Oh no, here it comes  the 
ml 04. Now the Young Executive 
and I cant share a cab due to the 
suspension of bus service. But 
what if he doesnt get on? What if 
hes waiting for the ml 01 or 102. 
Oh no. Here it comes. Well never 
see each other again. Unless, of 
course the young executive and I 
are both expecting the ml 04.
The bus driver is smiling, he 
obviously recognizes that he is a 
witness to destiny. He pulls the 
lever. The door squeaks open. 
Stepping up, I put four quarters 
in the box. I can hear the Young 
Executive folding his paper, and 
stepping up behind me.
We are going to ride together! 
Me to the dentist, he to the office, 
and both of us, beginning a won
derful life together. Oh, this is 
exciting. A lurch! My God, the 
ml 04 has lurched, and I have 
fallen back on The Man. I have 
stepped on the father of my future 
children. What now? Ill turn and 
gaze into his eyes. Hell grip my 
arm, and sparkle as he smiles 
down at me. That was no lurch 
it was an act of God.
But what empty air? The man 
is not a man.
I have clumsily stumbled into a 
14 year old boy with braces. Hes 
grinning at me lasciviously. The 
man of my dreams has been re
placed by a skateboard carrying 
member of the eighth grade. Dis
gusting. He even smells like 
Doritos. Now I have to spend my 
final hours before extraction on 
the bus with this future juvenile 
offender staring at me.

A Persons Opinion
Abortion is an issue that has 
been tearing this country apart 
ever since 1973 when Roe vs. 
Wade made abortion legal in 
the United States.
Last summer, the Supreme 
Court decided on another case 
that affected the abortion issue. 
In Webster vs. Reproductive 
Services, the nine judges on the 
court ruled in favor of a Mis
souri law restricting public 
funding for abortion.
Many pro-choicers were upset 
at the decision for obvious rea
sons. On November 12,300,000 
people turned out for a pro-choice 
rally in Wahsington, D. C. Across 
the street was a small pro-life 
rally which consisted of about 
100 people.
With this in mind we went out 
and asked several members of 
the Carnegie Mellon community 
about their opinions on abor
tion.

I think you should be able to do 
whatever you want with your 
body. I dont think that anybody 
has the right to tell you that you 
cant do what you want.
By ERIC MCANALLEN
Mike Zuccher 
Administrative Systems
I believe that everyone has a 
right to be free to choose what 
they want to do. The whole abor
tion issue is kind of complex. 
Maybe they should set some lim
its, but not total control. We cant 
be extreme one way or another on 
the whole issue.
Katie Dowling 
Freshman, CFA
If I were in the position that I 
would need an abortion, I cant 
imagine not having that option. I 
dont think that the government 
should have any control over what 
a woman does with her body. Also, 
if a woman wants an abortion bad 
enough, she will get one no mat
ter what, and that could put her 
life at risk.
Nathan McNamara 
Freshman, CIT
I cant say that Ive made a 
hard decision either way. Im 
aware of a lot of the issues in
volved. Ive been through them 
time and time again arguing with 
other people, but I have not made 
a decision, and Im glad that I 
havent had to make that decision 
myself.
Brad
Sophomore, CIT
Abortion is birth control for 
the irresponsible. I think 
should be illegal. No woman 
man should have the right 
arbitrarily terminate a life 
infinite potential.
Perhaps together we can 
overcome the boredom 
that plagues us all.
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

Li Lu, student leader, talks about communism
By HRNC FCA(A22H(
fartan Asst. Features Editor
When people ask me, What do 
you fight for? I simply answer, 
The right to be a human being, 
said Li Lu, one of the student 
leaders of the ill-fated protest in 
Tieneman Square. Lu recounted 
the Chinese students story of hope 
and despair Thursday night in 
the Skibo Ballroom.
Lu wove a tale of inhuman in
justice perpetuated upon the 
Chinese people and of the love 
nd humanity that came from the 
pure actions of those peacefully 
protesting in the square. Accord
ing to Lu, everyone present was 
(Ull of hope and love of liberty. All 
present were protesting as one

Slice of Life helps 
seniors in real life
By KEVIN BARNEY
Tartan Features Editor
A Slice of Life, a seminar pro
gram, was created for the seniors 
at Carnegie Mellon to help pre
pare them for the real world. 
According to Charles J. Vukotich 
Jr., the founder of Slice of Life, 
students want to know about 
various topics such as taxes, 
stocks, bonds, money manage
ment and entrepreneurship.
Going into the corporate world, 
students also wonder about cor
porate etiquette. Which fork 
should I use? How should I dress? 
'-are other questions that graduat
ing seniors have as they get ready 
to enter the real world.
The idea for A Slice of Life was 
;bom in Vukotichs living room 
;about two years ago. Four people 
were involved in the initial plan
ning stage: Vukotich, R. Hunter 
iCaffee, Frederick H. Rueter, and 
^Dieter Hale. In almost two hours, 
-the Slice of Life program was 
developed to the point were they 
jhad a huge list of topics that were 
|to be discussed at the program. 
[Eventually the list of topics was 
Jciit down to nine. The topics in
clude: service and consumerism, 
Investing for the beginner, taxes 
and entrepreneurship.
The seminar will be held on 
February 1 and invitations will 
j}e distributed over the holiday 
fcreak to all graduating seniors. 
It would be great if all 900 sen
iors said they wanted to come. 
Vukotich has made arrangements 
to accommodate only 300 seniors. 
Were going first class on this, 
ie said; filet mign on will be served 
for dinner.
The program will consist of 
eleven speakers, including a key
note address. All of the speakers 
are Carnegie Mellon alumni, 
donating their time to this semi
nar. The keynote speaker will be 
Jeffrey Zaslow, a nationally syn
dicated advice columnist. When 
Vukotich called him about Slice 
of Life, Zaslows response was, 
Sounds great, when is it? The 
rest of the alumni are also excited 
about being a part of the pro
gram.
All of the speakers are CMU 
alumni because Vukotich wanted 
Carnegie people talking to Car
negie people. The speakers are 
all experienced in giving presen
tations and in the field in which 
theyre talking about.
A Slice of Life is being spon
sored in part by Pepsi. According 
to Vukotich, Pepsi is interested in 
CMU and their students for the 
purpose of employment. Vukot
ich was asked by Pepsi how good 
CMU students were and he re
plied, Tm not going to tell you 
how good our students are. Hire 
them and find out.
 Although Vukotich is not sure 
whether or not Pepsi will fund the 
entire program or not, he has 
other sources who have said that 
they will help out. David Maloney, 
CMLPs vice-president for devel
opment guaranteed funding for 
the program because he is a true 
believer in it. This is going to 
happen and well take the tab [if 
necessary].
Vukotich also hopes that the 
program will become a-once-asemester program. Although, if 
no one shows up, well never do it 
again, he said.

tokens of their love for each other. 
Some gave pencils, some pens, 
some pieces of paper. One man 
gave them a bowl of soup, and 
another who had nothing to give, 
gave them his t-shirt that was 
signed by everyone he had met in 
Tieneman Square.
This, for Lu, is a symbol of the 
love for life and for each other. He 
says, That t-shirt is the closest 
thing to my heart... I was one of 
the people in that couple, and my 
wife is still in China. So even a 
symbol of hope has ended in de
spair for Lu.
This dual despair and hope is 
seen in Lus story about tne 
woman who picked up a flower on 
the way to the protest: ... she 
looked at this flower the whole 
way to Tieneman Square. The 
flower is symbolic of all the stu
dent protestors; it is young and 
pure, but it is going to die.
Lu told how the movement for 
liberty was not a new thing in 
China. His grandfather was ar
rested for being a counter-revolutionary and his father was 
sent to a prison camp for being 
a spy. The irony is that both his
father and grandfather believed 
in the Communist system. Lu 
says about his father, He was 
so patriotic, so committed to the 
Communist Party, yet, still they 
called him a Russian spy.
Lu, himself was lucky to escape 
persecution. He is one of only two 
students on the list of 21 most 
wanted political criminals who 
managed to get out of China. He 
estimates that 13 of the student 
leaders have already been ar
rested.
Yet, Lu is not discouraged. Af
ter Tieneman Square, many 
people told him that they failed to 
remove the Communist stigma 
from China. However, he count
ers with an old Chinese story.
There was an old man who was 
troubled because there was a big 
mountain in front of his door. So 
one day, he decided to move the 
mountain. After that, everyday, 
with his own hand tools, he moved 
a bit of the mountain. One day, a 
very wise, old man came and said, 
It is foolish to think that in his 
lifetime he can move the moun
tain with his own hands, and the 
old man said, I dont think that I 
can move the mountain in my 
lifetime. But you see, I have a son, 
and he will have a son, and my 
sons son will have a son, and in 
the end, the mountain will be 
moved.
Therefore, Lu concludes that, 
as the Berlin Wall was moved by 
the will of the people, so too will 
the Communist mountain be 
removed from China, by the will 
of the people and the passing of 
time.

Panel discusses sex 
in art at CMU Gallery
By LEAH CARLBERG
Tartan Staffwriter
Do we want to experience 
the McCarthy era again? said 
Elaine King last Wednesday, 
during a panel discussion at the 
CMU Gallery on Craig Street 
sponsored by the Pittsburgh 
Dance Council.
The topic of discussion was 
Sex, Violence and Politics: Do 
they have a place in the arts? 
Sitting on the panel were Mark 
Russell (out of town), Stevens 
Carter (artist), Donald Marinelli (CMU Drama depart
ment), Elaine King (director of 
CMU Gallery), and David 
Huffman (artist). Lynn Cullen, 
from WTAE, moderated.
The event began with every
one milling about to observe the 
two exhibits of Michel Gerard 
and Ida Applebroog. A conneseur that evening pronounced 
Gerards weights sculpture 
very sexual.
King began the discussion by 
introducing the audience to the 
seriousness of the problem. 
Cullen next proclaimed herself 
a nonartiste, and the other 
members of the panel intro
duced themselves.
The first point was that the 
introductory question was not 
a question at all, because obvi
ously sex, politics, and violence 
belong in art. The panel went 
on to discuss the National En
dowment for the Arts and Jesse
Helms, both of whom are trying 
to limit artistic expression by 
restricting public funding to 
those exhibits that have been 
deemed not obscene. Who ex
actly was capable ofsaying what 
is obscene was hotly debated, 
with Huffman querying Do 
narrow-mindedbigotsbelongin 
art? and Cullen commenting' 
on the cowardly lot on Capital 
Hill.
King read a self written edi
torial in which she addressed 
the inversion ofhuman rights, 
the Reagan era of corruption, 
and the fascist state, among 
other things. She called the 
present movement a serious 
threat and a crisis.
Members of the audience be
gan to voice concern over the 
path of the discussion and the 
side stepping of the title ques
tion. The discussion continued 
on, with such comments as 
Pittsburgh is underrated and 
that artists will not be 
milktoast but do deserve 
taxpayer money.
Cullen asked what exactly the 
hullaballoo was, and hadnt 
there always been a tension 
between artists and govern
ment. These questions were  
also brushed off in favor of dis
cussing the Bill of Rights, 
societys difficulty with putting 
male genetalia on display, and 
racism. The heated discussion 
quickly ended with no one reach
ing a conclusion of any kind.

Whatever you want to see at Carnegie Mellon
The Activities Board is offering the entire campus the opportu
nity to propose, plan and produce an event of your choice. 
Maybe you want to have a circus in the tent the week before 
graduation. Perhaps bringing in truckloads of sand and hav
ing a beach volleyball tournement is what you want. There is 
the possibility that your father is Mick Jagger and you can get 
us a great deal on the Rolling Stones. Whatever your idea is, 
this is your chance to pull it off.
The way we will run it is as follows:
1) Proposals for events should be submitted to the Activities Board Mailbox at 
Skibo Information Desk (Skinfo) by Friday January 26th.
2) Those people whose proposals are deemed workable by the Executive 
Board and by Student Affairs, will be contacted by the first week in February.
Proposals should be typed, and no longer than a page or two. We need to see the 
specifics with regard to price, dates, and what people will be doing what portions 
of the necessary work. It would also be useful if you included the reason that you 
feel that this event will appeal to the campus population in general. Please include 
a brief paragraph why you feel that you are the person to present this event to Car
negie Mellon.
The Activities Board Exec., Student Activities, and The Student Affairs Office re
serve the right to accept any number of the events proposed. This can be from all 
of them to none of them.

You would be responsible for all phases of the show or of the event. The Activities 
Board would advise you and whoever else you have helping you, act as your liason 
to the University, pay the bills but maintain final decisions. Effectively, you would 
become a member of AB's executive board. A Ghost Chairman as it were.
If this sounds like something that you would be interested in, then take the time 
and do it up. If yours is one of the ideas that we select, then you will have a lot of 
work ahead of you. It's going to be a big project. One worthy of 9 units credit. Too 
bad we can't give that to you. What you will get is the knowledge that you pro
duced the whole show.

How not to cook up a storm
By JASON LEE SMITH
Tartan Staffwriter
Need a new recipe to add zip to 
your parties? Are you looking for 
a new dish to impress that certain 
special someone? Well, look no 
further, for from the kitchens of 
that world-renowned gourmand, 
Jason L. Smith, comes something 
guaranteed to tickle the fancy of 
even the most jaded palate. I 
havent yet thought up a name for 
this dish  most people feel that 
it defies description  but heres 
the recipe:
In a large bowl, place water, 
eggs, and butter. Mix. Add flour 
to taste. Pour onto a flat metal 
cookie sheet (no need to grease 
it  most people think the metal 
adds a little extra flavor). Place in 
lukewarm oven for five minutes. 
Cut into squares and garnish with 
dollops of chocolate icing. Serve.
Dont try to hide it. I can tell 
youre all licking your lips in 
anticipation. Now, before you go 
rushing off to the kitchen to try 
my recipe, sit down and listen to 
the story of its genesis.
It was in the autumn of my 
seventh year of existence. My 
mother and father had taken up 
the noble sport of bicycle riding. I 
have always viewed the bicycle as 
an infernal contraption designed
to make me sweat and give me 
multiple scrapes and contusions. 
At age seven, I refused to go near 
one. It happened that, one day, 
my parents allowed me to stay at 
home, alone, for the first time in 
my life, while they went on their 
daily ride. (What they did with 
me previous to this remains a 
mystery, I have vague memories 
of jogging along beside them, but 
I cant be sure.)
I realized that having full run 
of the house was an enormous 
responsibility, and I felt that I 
had to demonstrate that I was 
worthy of my parents trust. I 
decided that I would do a quiet, 
typical, boy-of-seven activity that 
would show my parents that I 
had been behaving myself.
To demonstrate my responsi
bility, in the fifteen minutes my 
parents were gone I would make 
cookies. Looking back on this 
incident, and others like it, I have 
become convinced that my child
hood was punctuated with fre
quent bouts of temporary insan
ity. I still cannot figure out what 
bizarre jump in logic suggested 
that this would be a good idea.
The first thing I noticed was 
how cluttered the kitchen table 
was. That, clearly, would never 
do. I spread the Sunday newspa
per over the floor and instantly 
had my workspace.
Getting a mixing bowl and an 
electric mixer (an appliance I have 
always been infatuated with), I 
proceeded to mix up a devils brew 
out of the aforementioned ingre
dients: water, egg, flour, and 
butter. (Evidently I had forgot
ten, or thought I did not need, 
yeast, sugar, and vanilla. When I 
get into a state like that, I do not 
live in the real world.) This mix
ture formed a milky, white ooze. I 
poured my dough onto a cookie 
sheet, trying not to let too much 
run off the sides, arid placed it
into the oven. To me, five minutes 
seemed like ample time to let my 
concoction bake, but then, I also 
saw nothing wrong with having a 
cookie dough which needed to be 
poured out of the bowl, so I dont 
think my judgement was in tip
top shape.
I removed the cookies from 
the oven, and had just finished 
icing three of them, when my 
parents walked through the door. 
Following the odor, which my 
mother later described as burnt 
wallpaper paste, they arrived in 
the kitchen just in time to see my 
culinary masterpiece.
To the untrained eye, it may 
have looked like a child, in the 
grip of dementia, sitting on news
paper, playing with white goo 
topped with chocolate sauce. But 
these were my parents, and they 
knew instinctively that I had 
made them cookies.
They were clearly moved. My 
mother had to back out of the 
room slowly, laughing hysteri
cally, such was the depth of her 
emotion. My father was able to 
keep more of a straight face. He 
even consented to try the first 
cookie. (I had resisted the temp
tation easily. I might have been 
crazy, but I sure wasnt stupid.)
After he had pretended to take 
a bite, he said, very gently, lest he 
hurt my feelings, Jason, you 
didnt make cookies, you made 
egg-noodles. He then took me by 
the hand and led me out of the 
room. Still doubled over with 
laughter, my mother could only 
manage to get out, Why did you 
work on the floor? At the time, I 
thought my answer was very logi
cal: Because there was stuff on 
the table.
And that is why Im not allowed 
in the kitchen anymore.

George Bush, the president of the United States, spoke on campus April 10,1980 when he was on 
the campaign trail for the presidency. Needless to say, he lost at the Republican National Convention 
several months later to Ronald Reagan. Bush spoke to a packed Wherrett Room for about fifteen 
minutes.

In this, our fourth pizza test, we 
carefully examined Larry & 
Carols Pizza. We received a large 
pepperoni pizza and a special 
consisting of cheddar cheese, 
mozzarella, tomatoes, ham and 
onions. The two cheeses were what 
made this pizza unique in com
parison to the other pizzas we 
have seen so far.
The pizza arrived in 40 min
utes, just under the promised time 
of 45. We had to let it sit for a 
while to cool off because it was 
very hot. Thats something we

We first analyzed the pepperingredients was nothing extraorare other companies that might

these generous portions. One 
must realize that pepperoni and 
cheese are, after all, the main 
points to a standard pizza and, as 
such, they should be given the at
tention they deserve.
Our only reservations were with 
the crust. It was neither gum-ball 
chewy, nor toast crisp. The best 
description might be to say that it 
was a little soggy.
After finishing off the standard, 
we moved right along and ana
lyzed the special. We were sur
prised to see the two cheeses on it, 
because we had never experienced 
anything like this before. It turned 
out to be very good. We guessed 
that the two cheeses were Ameri
can and mozzarella, but upon
talking to Larry & Carols we 
found out that they were cheddar 
and mozzarella; we must i 
then, that this is a very mild 
cheddar. There were plenty o( 
toppings (Although it was hard to 
examine anything other than the 
cheeses which covered the entire 
pizza), all of which were of superior quality. We were not too sure 
if we would like to consistent!)'

theres something on top of the bed."
The Far Side is a daily feature in the Pittsburgh Post Gazette.
"Its Henderson again, sir... He always faints at the 
sight of yolk."
"Trapped like rodentia!"
Suddenly, amidst all the confusion, Flfi seized the

We had the big press confer- ence yesterday in the Dallas-Fort
 Worth Airport freight terminal to 
announce  I guess I dont have 
to tell you this by now, youve
. probly seen it on CNN  to an
nounce the continuation of the 
Joe Bob Briggs World Tour. Were 
going out again in February for
 Phase Three: The Boonies. Right 
away the people at the press con
ference started bombarding me 
:for details.
Joe Bob, are you gonna be 
funny this time? (Wanda Bodine 
,'was at the press conference.)
Joe Bob, you arent gonna sing 
again, are you? The last time you 
sang, we had to give back some
- tickets. (Cherry Dilday was at 
the press conference, too.)
Mr. Briggs, what about the 
rumors that youre just too old to 
do this anymore? Can we expect a 
: little slower show, less energy?
But I nipped that question in 
the bud. Yes you can, I shot 
back. I am older, and the show 
' will be much slower.
. And, of course, I was waiting on 
the toughest question of all.
Mr. Briggs, will you be appear/ing at the Lotsa Yucks Comedy 
Club in Kokomo, Indiana?
They always ask me this. They 
know this is the site of my most 
notorious moment, when I bit the 
head off a live gopher onstage. 
The gopher turned out to be the 
mascot of the Montrose Elemen
tary School special education 
! basketball team. There were edi
torials in the paper. It doesnt 
matter what I say about this. 
Look, they threw a gopher up on 
the stage, I bit its head off. I did a 
lot of weird stuff in those days.
Joe Bob Goes
Are you gonna hold me respon
sible for this the rest of my life? 
Mr. Briggs, are you aware that 
several of the special-education 
students in Kokomo have gone 
through years of therapy by now, 
as they attempt to relieve the 
horror of seeing their dead, head
less pet coughed up out of a lame
brain comedians mouth?
But, you know, youre in the 
public eye, you have to learn to 
deal with this kind of stuff. So I 
took the bull by the horns and I 
said, All right, no more ques
tions about Kokomo. I havent 
been invited to Kokomo. Its not 
on the tour. Im here to talk about 
the future. Id be happy to field 
questions from every single re
porter thats here today.
But then both of em left and I 
was stuck with Wanda and 
Cherry.
Why do you do this to yourself, 
Joe Bob? Wanda asked me. Why 
do you go to slimepit nightclubs 
in western Maryland and act like 
an idiot?
You mean we got that western 
Maryland booking!!!! All right! I 
was getting worried!
Joe Bob  this was Cherry 
putting in her two cents worth  
Joe Bob, how do you expect people 
to think youre a great comedian 
if you dont go on The Tonight 
Show all the time? What do they
*  say when they introduce you? Dont
* they have to say
# Direct from Theh
 Tonight Show, or 
|9 else everybody 
thinks youre a 
*  * * * lamebrain?
Cherry, you 
dont understand the comedy busi
ness. Some guys have been on 
The Tonight Show 798 times and 
theyre still lamebrains.
Joe Bob, if you go on The To
night Show, will you say my 
name?
I gotta get new management. 
February First. Thirty cities, 
including the only time in the last 
two years that Ive agreed to be on 
the same bill with Guns n Roses. 
The Farewell Tour. Be there.
Joe Bob, you cant say its a 
farewell tour unless youre say
ing farewell to something.
Im saying farewell to you, 
Cherry.
The Joe Bob Briggs Farewellto-Current-Management Tour.
Speaking of healthy, active 
showbiz careers, time to review 
the new Grampa Munster movie, 
Fright House. Its the chilling story 
of a huge-breasted topless witch 
who slices open teenagers wrists 
and tells them its therapy. This 
may be the finest performance of 
A1 Lewis since ... well, since he 
was Grampa Munster. Some frat 
boys inherit the old Vincent 
mansion, but inside the old Vin
cent mansion is ... old Vincent! A 
goofy old ghost who rises up be
hind a table and says You are all 
doomed! It seems that maybe 
the old Vincent mansion is the 
key to the mysterious way all the
teenagers in town are commit
ting suicide by ripping their wrists 
open with enormous swords, but 
then thats just theory, according 
to Police Chief Grampa Munster. 
Well have to wait till the gates of 
hell open and three or four 
motheaten zombies emerge be
fore we find the answer.
Unfortunately, the gates of hell 
open too soon and the movie is 
over in 65 minutes, so if you rent 
the video, you get another movie 
tacked on the end Abadon, the 
chilling story of a smallerbreasted vampiress whos suck
ing the blood of innocent art stu
dents. And the only guy that can 
save her is ... Duane Jones, the 
star of Night of the Living Deadl 
(Where you been all these years, 
Duane?) The reason we know its 
Duane Jones is the movies titles 
and posters say Duane Jones, 
star of Night of the Living Dead 
about 14 times. Duane Jones 
reads Tarot cards and lurks 
around the art school until the 
vampiress explodes or disinte
grates. (Hard to tell what hap
pens to anybody in either one of 
these movies, cause theyre so 
dark sometimes the people just 
flat disappear.)
Anyhow, pretty decent little 
trivia package put together here 
by Studio Entertainment, as in 
Bet you didnt know what other 
movie Duane Jones made, or Did 
you know Grampa Munster made 
a horror movie where he was 
supposed to be a real warlock? 
And then you can bet some money 
and fast-forward these babies till 
something happens, which is once 
about every ten minutes. And you 
should check it out even if you

By SCARLETT TOWNSEND
Tartan Staffwriter
WQED/Channel 13 presents its 
seventh annual Make A Joyful 
Noise production on Wednesday, 
December 13 at 9:15 pm and Sat
urday, December 16 at 7 pm .Make 
A Joyful Noise is a celebration of 
gospel music which features sev
eral well-known western Penn
sylvania ensembles illustrating 
the many styles of gospel music.
Reverend Richard Allen 
Farmer, a noted musicologist, will 
join host Christopher Moore for 
entertaining and informative 
commentary about the musical 
selections.
Farmer is a noted musician, 
preacher, and dean of the chapel 
at Gordon College in Wenham, 
Massachusetts. For eight years 
he was the senior pastor and 
teacher at Bethany Baptist
Church in Pittsburgh, where he 
developed strong ties with the 
city. These ties are bringing him 
back for his third year of Make A 
Joyful Noise. Farmer said, I have 
a great love for the city of Pitts
burgh. In fact he was Moores 
pastor for eight years, during 
which they developed a lasting 
friendship.
Between performances Moore 
will join Farmer at the piano for 
brief conversations about the 
music. Farmer said, The conver
sations are like oral program notes 
which will tell the audience what 
to listen for. They will provide the 
audience with a sense of how to 
hear the music. He will also be 
demonstrating these various 
types of gospel music on the pi
ano.
The program gets better every 
year because there are different 
groups every year with different

Well, its that time of year again. 
Christmas is right around the 
corner, theres a slight nip in the 
air, finals up the wazoo, and movjes galore. This years movies dont 
]eeni to be any different than the 
ast few years. Almost all the new 
wovie s coming out within the next 
year are sequels too, and since 
Job Zemeckis, director of Back to 
IheFuture, came up with the wonlerful idea of shooting sequels 
[aclc-to-back, we can now see two 
equels of the same movie within 
me year:
Starting the list off is Christ
mas Vacation, which opened last 
;eek. After traveling through 
jnerica and Europe, the 
Jriswolds have decided to stay 
iome this year and enjoy their 
hristmas vacation. However, 
(lings begin to get a little hairy 
rhen one or two (or ten) relatives 
!0W up uninvited and cause 
lajor havoc. If you liked the last 
wo Vacation movies, youll probaily enjoy this one as well.
The next sequel due out is The 
'wo Jakes, which is the longwaited sequel to Chinatown. In 
his film, Jack Nicholson both 
itars and directs, as he once again 
ijpys detective Jake Gittes. The 
rjfio Jakes was originally suped to come out last summer, 
it Nicholson wanted to add some 
ast-minute touches to the movie, 
reby pushing its release date 
lack to December.
re No Angels is one of the
few big movies coming out within 
the next year which is not a se
quel. Robert De Niro and Sean 
Penn star as two convicts who 
manage to break out of prison. On 
the run, the two stumble into a 
New England town renowned for 
its shrine and take on the guise of 
two priests. Were No Angels is 
due out in mid-December.
Another big non-sequel due out 
this summer is the release of 
Chester Goulds Dick Tracy. Stars 
include Warren Beatty as the 
square-jawed detective (hes also 
producing and directingthe film), 
Glenne Headly as Tess Trueheart, 
Madonna (singing three songs) as 
Breathless Mahoney, and a cameo 
appearance by Dustin Hoffman.
Two new Steven Spielberg 
movies are due out, and believe it'oets come to Webster Hall

I Remember in high school when 
lour teacher used to read some

Well, imagine if the poet read

pportunity tomorrow at 8 pm in 
ie Carnegie Lecture Hall when 
Be International Poetry Forum 
proudly presents Andrew Hudgns and Heather McHugh, read5 excerpts from their own works. 
;Life Is Too Short To Be Small 
t the program title, taken from 
ie dedication in McHughs book 
hades. What is even more spe
cial about the event is that this 
reading will be the first time ei
ther poet has appeared at the 
forum.
Angie Kazmeraski, the admin
istrative assistant for the Inter
national Poetry Forum, says that 
the poets programs are not yet 
set. Usually the poet will just 
wing it, depending on the nature 
of the audience, she says. The 
poets will work from the 
audiences mood to direct their 
own style of presentation.
Both poets are well known. 
Hudgins was nominated for the 
Pulitzer Prize in 1986 for his first 
book of poetry, Saints and Strang
ers. Another highly praised work 
of poems, After the Lost War, dis
plays Hudgins flair for poetry. 
Written in the voice of a poet and 
musician who died in Georgia in 
1881, it is a compelling narrative 
with emotional impetus.
Currently, Hudgins is the 1989- 
90 Alfred Hodder Fellow at Prin
ceton University, after being 
named a Wallace Stagner Fellow

potential to live up to the stan
dards of the original.
Like Back to the Future II and
III, Aliens III and IV are being 
shot back-to-back. No word on 
what the plot is in either film; 
however, it has been reported that 
Sigourney Weaver will briefly 
appear in III and star in IV.
Batman II, and in the near 
future Batman III, will quickly 
begin production making use of
the still-standing sets in England. 
Speculation on villain casting 
includes the Riddler, Catwoman, 
and the Penguin with Robin Wil
liams, Cher, and Danny DeVito 
as candidates for the respective 
roles. Michael Keaton will, of 
course, play Batman again.
Even though its been over fif
teen years since the last Godfa
ther movie, The GodfatherThe 
Continuing Story is due out some
time next year. Once again 
Francis Ford Coppola will direct; 
however, The Godfather  The 
Continuing Story will be sans 
Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen, who 
reportedly couldnt get the money 
he wanted. George Hamilton has 
just signed onto the project and 
might be the replacement for 
Duvall. Shooting has already 
begun in Rome and will continue 
until March.
In the horror department be 
sure to look for Scanners II: The 
New Order, written by B.J. 
Nelson; The Pit & the Pendulum, 
starring Peter OToole and Billy 
Dee Williams; The Bride of the 
Re-Animator, The Evil Dead III; 
The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 
III (which originally received an 
X rating for its graphic violence); 
Buried Alive, staring Donald 
Pleasance and Robert Vaughn; 
Fear, starring Ally Sheedy as a 
psychic who has to pit her abili
ties against a psychic serial killer; 
Food of the Gods II; Deathstalker

By JEFF MULLER
Tartan Staffwriter
At the beginning of the semes
ter I promised to bring you the 
latest in jazz, both in the city of 
Pittsburgh and nationwide. Well, 
I have done so, but there is one 
more musician you have to know 
about before the semester draws 
to a close. Who is this jazz mes
senger? Guitarist Jimmy Ponder.
A Pittsburgh native, Ponder has 
consistently been away from the 
city since he was 18, when he was 
discovered at the now defunct 
Crawfords Grill. Since his depar
ture he has recorded 14 albums 
as a leader, toured the world, and 
backed up such diverse acts as 
singers Lena Home and Roberta 
Flack, organists Jimmy McGriff 
and JackMcDuff, and bassist Ron 
Carter. As a sideman he has 
appeared on an additional 100 
albums, includingthose ofMcDuff 
and Carter.
Born into a musical family  
his father was a music educator 
 Ponder started off playing the 
mandolin. He soon switched to 
guitar, influenced by the styles of 
Wes Montgomery and Kenny 
Burrell. It is Montgomerys fluid 
style that is most evident in 
Ponders playing, including his 
extensive octave technique and 
the use of his thumb instead of a
pick. Although his stylistic roots 
are evident, Ponders success has 
come because he was able to de
velop his own sound.
My appreciation led to a short 
conversation with Ponder and his 
brother, during which I was able 
to find out a few of his views on 
music and the Pittsburgh jazz 
scene.
Ponder returned to his home
town after staying in New York 
City for a number of years, mainly 
because the competitiveness in 
New York is intense. This cut
throat atmosphere can bum out 
even the best musicians, so he 
has come home, saying I couldnt 
have picked a better time to come 
to Pittsburgh.
He is very impressed with and 
surprised by the jazz scene that 
has developed here since he left, 
and he hopes to assist with this 
jazz renaissance.
Before returning to the stage 
for another set, which included 
beautiful versions of such peren
nial standards 
as Misty and 
God Bless the 
Child, Ponder 
shared his 
musical moti
vation with 
me. The es
sence of my 
being is in 
playing. [It allows me to] relate 
my life to life, the sweetness of 
life. This is my contribution to ex
istence.
Ponder has a fortunate few 
students with whom he shares 
this and other views on music, 
and it is an ex-student of his, gui
tarist Geary Moore, that accom
panies him on his latest release 
on Muse records. Entitled Jump, 
this album highlights the use of 
the classic guitar/organ trio. 
Ponder is j oined on the Hammond 
B-3 organ by Big John Patton, a 
veteran of Alfred Lions Blue N ote 
Records stable, and the alwaysdynamic Eddie Gladden on 
drums. Moore appears on a couple 
of tracks, as do tenor saxophonist 
James Anderson and percussion
ist Lawrence Killian.
The album opens with the Ponder-penned Ill Always Be There, 
a bouncy George Benson-type 
tune, which sets an upbeat at
mosphere. There are three other 
Ponder originals, of which my
favorites are Blues for Betty, 
with a guitar and sax duet on a 
punchy melody, and When Love 
Comes My Way, a lush ballad 
which opens with solo guitar and 
showcases some of Ponders best 
playing.
Also included are four stan
dards, including T-Bone Walkers 
blues-classic Stormy Monday 
Blues. Paying tribute to Bobby 
Blue Bland, Ponder adds vocals 
on this one, singing with remark
able conviction for a man who is 
primarily an instrumentalist. The 
Rodgers and Hart classic My 
Romance is treated to a 6/8 feel 
and shows Ponder at his best, 
technically gifted and showing a 
great deal of imagination. One 
last song which deserves mention 
is Duke Ellingtons In a Mellow 
Tone, which opens with a twoguitar duet following which Moore 
slips into Freddie Green style 
strumming while Ponder 
stretches out.
This is a great album and a wel
come contribution from one of 
Pittsburghs mosttalentednative 
sons. If you want to see Ponder in 
action, he is booked for a few more 
gigs at Clearwater this month. 
Also, check/n Pittsburgh for other 
possible shows. Well, until next 
semester, keep on swinging hard!
Jeff Muller is a junior writing 
major.
The start of the decade will be swamped with sequels
gFanAa(lk &0FI ho;l C:!
has already started in Europe on 
Captain America, who faces the 
Red Skrill, his long-time enemy.
Watchmen (based on the DC 
limited series), written by Sam 
CBatman) Hamm, was going to be 
directed by Terry (Time Bandits, 
Brazil) Gilliam, is currently in 
limbo. The word out is that Fox 
Studios was nervous about the 
proposed cost and dropped the 
movie like a hot potato.
Brooke Shields will play the title 
role in Brenda Starr, with Timo
thy Dalton as Basil St. John. Other 
adaptations being considered are 
Iron Man, Sub-Mariner, 
Wolverine, Ant Man, The Flash,
Plastic Man (possibly with Pee 
Wee Herman in the title role), 
Green Hornet, The Phantom, The 
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, 
The Shadow, and a live-action 
Flintstones.
Arnold Schwarzenegger is going 
to have a new movie out, Total 
Recall, which deals with a lot of 
time travel. The Neverending 
Story: II is being directed by 
George Miller (Mad Max) and is 
due out sometime this summer. 
And George Hamilton reappears 
as the bumbling vampire in Love 
at Second Bite: Dr acula Goes to 
Hollywood.
Even though Star Trek V: The 
Final Frontier was a box office
disaster, Star Trek VI is already 
in the works. However, William 
Shatner and Leonard Nimoy 
might not be starring in the next 
film. Producer Harve Bennett is 
unwilling to shell out the $6 mil
lion each to Shatner and Nimoy 
and has threatened several times 
in the past that he will do a film 
with new actors, showing the 
young Kirk and Spock during their 
days at the Academy.
In the past, Bennetts threat 
didnt frighten Shatner or Nimoy, 
but after the deep dive number 
five took, they should begin to 
worry. Reportedly, Bennett has 
already written the Kirk-andSpock-at-the-Academy screen
play, and is currently looking 
around for young players for the 
lead roles.
Finally, just to whet your appe
tite, here are movies in the works 
to be released within the next few 
years. Rocky V, Gone With the 
Wind II, Die Hard II, Three Men 
and a Baby II, Willow II, and 
Birth of an Empire,the next movie

like the 90s are going to be a busy

Germany, Year Zero
 Set in post-World War II Germany, this movie is 
largely a somber reflection on some of the dominant 
political issues of that era. The protagonist is a 
teenage boy who spends his time meandering 
'through the wrecked remains of Berlin, pondering 
I'the nature and causes of the Nazi philosophy that 
-had such a dire effect upon his existence. Though 
detached and surrealistic, the film verges occasionally towards the flavor of a documentary. If this is 
"the sort of film you like, then this is the movie for 
you.

1 Though strictly innocuous Rated-G fare, this 
' musical childrens classic is so abundant with imagi
nation and fantastic imagery that it attains a time
less status that demands a rewatching at least once 
a decade. The story involves a destitute but goodnatured young boy touring a Utopia of childhood 
fantasy  a magical chocolate factory. The back
bone of the movie is Gene Wilders witty portrayal 
< the brilliant but eccentric factory proprietor, 
"Willy Wonka, and his energetic personality keeps 
-the movie from bogging down in glassy-eyed Fanta
sia triteness. Wonka remains admirably true to its 
.paperback progenitor, with only a single extrane

I heartily recommend this to anyone who has had,

Lethal Weapon II
Most cop films invariably either submerge their 
dignity with insipid slapstick humor, or collapse 
into cliche-riddled combinations of Dragnet and 
The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Fortunately, Le
thal Weapon II is of that rare breed that manages to 
evenly juxtapose action, comedy, and drama in 
satisfying proportions. More impressive still is the 
subtle inclusion of - dare I say it?  character 
development! Costars Mel Gibson and Danny Glover 
convincingly play two personable detectives who 
attempt to penetrate the scandalous web of evil 
doings propagated by a corrupt South African am
bassador. The movie ostensibly develops the style 
of its predecessor, but doesnt rely on it, so that you 
I can enjoy Lethal Weapon II without having seen the

Music presents Christmas Concert
By JOSH D. RUBEN
Tartan Contributing Editor
The CMU Music Department 
will present its annual Christ
mas Concert today at 11:30 am in 
the atrium of the College of Fine 
Arts.
The concert will feature both 
the CMU Concert Choir and the 
Repertory Chorus along with the 
CMU Philharmonic Orchestra, 
and admission is free.
The concert is one of the last 
great CMU traditions still recog
nized by the entire campus. The 
Music Department plans the 
concert to coincide with the study
ing crunch that students go 
through as final exams approach 
at the end of the fall semester. Ac
cording to many of the students 
who perform, as well as those who 
attend, the concert is a wonderful
way to ease into the finals period 
while ringing in the holiday sea
son.
The orchestra will perform 
pieces including Lukas Foss 
Night Music for John Lennon 
without the choir, under the di
rection of Sidney Harth. Robert 
Page, director of Choral Studies, 
will take the podium and conduct 
both the orchestra and the choirs.
The choral program will fea
ture the ever popular Hallelujah 
Chorus from Handels Messiah. 
Even those who do not celebrate 
Christmas are moved by the 
beauty and power of this piece. 
Page combines the Concert and 
Repertory ensembles in order to 
truly bring out the power and 
emotion of the piece. When 
coupled with the angelic sounds 
written for the orchestra, a lis
tener can easily hear why the
Hallelujah Chorus is a canon of 
Western music.
Page has also scheduled ex
cerpts from J.S. Bachs Mass in 
B Minor. This piece is classic 
Bach in its mathematical preci
sion and progression of the fugue. 
Bach works the Latin text in such 
a way that when he wants more 
volume or power, he simply puts 
two or more voice parts together. 
There are no dynamic marks 
anywhere in the music telling the 
singers to get louder or softer. 
The gentle, lyric stacking of voices 
makes it a good contrast to the 
raw power of Handel.
One of the most elegant and 
certainly the most Christmassy 
piece in the entire program is 
Ralph Vaughan Williams Fan
tasia of Christmas Carols. It 
begins with a beautiful baritone 
solo, sung by senior Gary Kline,
which sounds somewhat like a 
Gregorian Chant, only in Eng
lish. Strings accompany the solo 
until the choir enters in a soft,; 
humming tone. Then the entire; 
choir sings the next verse of the: 
chant.
This is only the second concert 
of the year the singing ensembles. 
will perform, and the members 
are anxious to do well in a concert 
designed for their fellow class
mates and teachers.
The Concert Choir will perform., 
in a special concert this Friday at;, 
PPG Plaza at noon. That concert, 
will feature more traditional car-r 
ols including special arrange-- 
ments of White Christmas andp 
Ill Be Home for Christmas by 
Page. The Music Department 
mailed out over 30,000 brochures; 
about the concert and a large, 
crowd is expected.
Sibling musical taste is questionable
...inreview
have to buy some new records 
(wouldnt want to interest the boy 
in outdated music, would we?), 
but the holidays require everyone 
to make some sacrifices. So, allow 
me to offer some suggestions for 
your holiday peace of mind.
If you need a rap record that 
stands up to repeated listenings 
(and that wont piss your parents 
off with those icky fuck or shit 
words), De La Soul is the magic 
number. Their LP Three Feet High 
And Rising has a half-bizillion 
songs on it (or maybe just twenty, 
I dont remember), all crammed 
onto a single slab of wax. The 
songs are equally crammed full of 
samples and bites, stuff that
hasnt shown up 
anywhere else, 
ranging from Hall 
and Oates to eve
rything else that I 
dont recognize. 
They wedge them 
all together seam
lessly, though, and 
end up with the 
most innovative hip hop of the 
last few years. Your relatives will 
like it, and so will you.
Of course, your siblings might 
hate rap. Surveys show that many 
youngsters, in their never-end
ing quest to annoy everyone 
around them, have turned to fluffy 
metal like Poison or Skid Row. 
This can be dealt with in the same 
manner, but youll want to work 
fast, or theyll end up stupid for 
life.
The weapon of choice in this 
case is Nirvana and their LP called 
Bleach. While they meet all the 
Sub Pop fashion requirements 
(long hair, Chuck Taylors, etc.), 
they mix up hard rock whomp

My little brother discovered rap 
this year. This is okay. He lis
tened to Tone Loc for three months 
nonstop. This is not okay, and 
will lead to his certain death over 
the Christmas break.
While his death would free up a 
bed in our overcrowded house, it 
would probably upset the rela
tives a bit, so another approach is 
needed. Luckily, my little 
brothers taste is easily swayed 
smashing his tape into tiny pieces 
and offering a different one is 
usually all it takes. This should 
work for anyones younger sib
lings (or for complete strangers, 
as long as they dont have larger 
siblings that will hurt you), and I 
recommend it highly.
Of course, this process requires 
a suitable replacement tape, suit
able in the sense that you dont 
hate it. The easiest way to insure 
this is to tape one of your own 
records. This means that youll
and pop sensibilities so that youcan sing along with the recordwhile you jump around like a 
ninny. They also do a fine cover of 
the Shocking Blues Love Buzz," 
so your parents and elder rela
tives can all go Dont I know this 
from somewhere?
Best of all, Nirvanas guitarshave been proven to kill crotchety 
old great-aunts on the spot, or at 
least drive them to a hotel so you, 
can have your bed back. (Dont 
ask me who proves these things. I 
just make them up. Just buy the 
record.)
While youre at it, pick up the 
new Bastards LP Monticello just 
for yourself. Its loud and heavy, 
(rocks like unto a bitch, it has 
been said) and will scare the rela.- 
tives out of your room so that you 
can get some peace and quiet.
And thats what the holidays 
are all about, isnt it?

Why
del
'W
y'
...humans must not view nature as something to be exploited and consumed. 
Instead, we must understand that this fragile, infinitely complex planet requires 
care and needs balance. Failure to understand that humankind is only one part of 
an organic whole exacts a debt that can be repaid only through the mortgaging of 
future generations. ~
Threshold National Student Environmental Conference
We have inherited the incredible opportunity as well as the profound responsibility to change the 
norms, practices, and priorities of our culture in order to create a sustainable future for ourselves 
and for our planet. Our Earth's environmental peril is inherently tied to the shortsightedness of our 
society, to our ignorance of the interconnectedness of all things. We must begin to plan for the 
long-range, become aware of the vast implications of even the smallest of our actions, and learn to 
think beyond the narrow scope of ourselves and our lifetimes towards a more global viewpoint.
Albert Einstein said "The environment is everything that isn't me." We need to go one step further 
and realize that the environment includes ourselves as well. The decisions we make about what we 
eat, wear, drive, purchase, and perhaps even think will, through the intricate links that constitute our 
world, effect much more than ourselves.
For example, as you load up your cart at the grocery store, you probably load in an enormous 
amount of packaging. Packaging, in fact accounts for ten percent of the price of your groceries. But 
choosing highly packaged items does much more than cost you money  it contributes to many of 
the pressing environmental problems facing us today.
Plastic packaging is made from petroleum, a non-renewable resource, generates toxic compounds 
during its manufacture, takes 200 to 400 years to decompose, and leeches toxic chemicals into 
landfills, and likely into the groundwater. Even further from home, much plastic waste ends up in 
our oceans where birds, turtles, dolphins, and other sea mammals may fatally ingest or become 
entangled in it. The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute estimates that there as many as 46,000 
pieces of plastic per square mile of ocean.
Paper packaging is no better. Packaging accounts for half the paper consumed in the U.S., and most 
of it ends up in landfills, taking up one-third of our landfill space. Once in the landfill, it too can leech 
dangerous chemicals into the groundwater. Thirty-five percent of the world's annual wood harvest 
is now devoted to packaging  experts predict the rate will climb to 50 percent by the year 2000. 
This process contributes significantly to worldwide deforestation, and thus to the greenhouse effect, 
and also to the destruction of irreplaceable rain forests and old-growth forests, habitats of 
innumerable species. Finally, the paper industry is the largest single industrial user of fuel oil, a 
non-renewable fossil fuel whose combustion emits greenhouse gasses and acid-rain producing 
chemicals.
This analysis of packaging is just one example of how what we consume effects the world we live 
in. The following pages will provide you with the information you need to analyze the 
environmental consequences of all your daily actions.
We cannot continue this wholesale destruction of our Earth. We must instead learn to be good 
guests, to step lightly on the Earth.

---------------------------------------------------

During the National Beach Cleanup in the fall of 
1988, some 47,500 volunteers found a total of 
1,973,995 items  nearly two million pounds  
of debris along 3,500 miles of shoreline. Among 
these items were everything from mattresses 
and bedsprings to kitchen sinks. (The 
volunteers even found 11 bottles with notes 
inside.) However, approximately 62 percent of 
the debris collected was made of plastic. This 
large number is not surprising, for plastic's light 
weight and buoyancy makes it easily carried 
ashore by the currents, while its durability 
makes it last much longer than other materials.
So just who is responsible for all of this litter? 
Approximately 16 percent of the reported items 
come from commercial ship dumping, 
petroleum industry operations, fisheries, and 
recreational boats. A small number of the Items, 
around 1,000, were reported to have labels from 
foreign countries. The rest comes from careless 
people: sloppy vessel loading practices, people 
who throw used fishing gear and galley 
garbage into the sea, sewer overflows that pipe 
tons of waste into the ocean, and just plain 
carelessness.
The solution to this problem is not a simple 
one. Some people say degradable plastics are 
the answer, but they merely break down into 
smaller and smaller plastic pieces.
Recycling would seem to be the logical answer. 
Approximately 17 percent of all debris reported 
was recyclable material. States which had 
"bottle bills," where a deposit of a few cents is 
added to the price of the beverage, had the 
lowest amount of such wastes. Recycling helps 
a considerable amount, but the ultimate 
solution requires a change in people's behavior 
and attitudes.
Citizen beach cleanups are an extremely 
effective tool for increasing awareness. It's hard 
to look at one's own trash in quite the same 
way after spending several hours cleaning up 
someone else's. Also, mass media coverage of 
the last few summers' disasters has prompted 
concern. Writing to your congressman wouldn't 
hurt either.
In short, nothing is going to change until 
people's habits change. Before you throw that 
piece of garbage into the ocean, think about 
what it might do to your beach that summer. 
And when you see a piece of trash laying on the 
beach, pick it up and put it in a dumpster. A 
little help goes a long way.
Wetlands
Wetlands often go under other names, such as 
bogs, swamps, or marshes. In the past wetlands 
were generally viewed as wastelands, places 
filled with mosquitoes, biting flies, and 
poisonous snakes. Largely because of this 
negative view, wetlands were regarded as
potential sites for development or waste 
disposal. However, over the last thirty years or 
so our knowledge about wetlands and their 
natural values has greatly increased.
One primary value of wetlands is their ability to 
help maintain water quality in our rivers and 
other bodies of water. Wetlands act as natural 
filters, much like kidneys. They filter out all 
kinds of nutrients, wastes, and sediment that 
flow into them from polluted streams or rivers.
For fish-rearing and spawning areas, wetlands 
are the most productive ecosystem in the 
world. Figures indicate that over half of the 
commercial catch in the North Atlantic is 
dependent on wetlands for some portion of its 
life cycle.
Finally, wetlands are excellent protection from 
storm and flood damage. Wetland trees and 
plants help slow down the speed of flood 
waters and will significantly reduce the impact 
of a hurricane.
What might be most surprising is that 95 
percent of U.S. wetlands are inland. In 
Pennsylvania alone there are 431',000 acres of 
wetland. However, the wetlands are slowly 
starting to disappear.
Early on, wetlands were chosen as sites for new 
cities such as New York City and Pitttsburgh 
because they were next to the mouths of major 
rivers. More recently, loss of wetlands is due 
primarily to the development of cities, roads, 
Industry, housing, highways, recreational 
facilities, and other man-made items. Often, 
wetlands are either filled up or drained to get 
them out of the way.
Fortunately, wetlands are protected and only a 
small number are destroyed each year. Still, 
people are finding ways around the regulations 
and it is impossible to fully protect wetlands 
from all types of assaults. Only a few hundred 
acres are lost per state per year, but these 
quickly add up. Within five years over half a 
million acres will be lost to man-made 
structures.
To add insult to injury, there really isn't much 
one can do directly to save the wetlands. You 
can support local government programs and 
initiatives through the ballot, public comment, 
and public participation. You can also join a 
number of local citizen activist groups. These 
groups collect data, disseminate information, 
and lobby to protect wetlands within their 
communities.
The wetland problem might not be as serious 
now as it was when it motivated the Clean 
Water Act in the early '70s, but a little bit of help 
you can prevent it from ever becoming a 
desparate one again in the long term.

Did you know 900 U.S. sewage treatment plants 
discharge 9.5 billion gallons of sewage sludge 
directly into estuaries and near-coastal waters 
each day? And that another 3.2 billion gallons 
are discharged each day by over 1,300 
commercial and industrial facilities into our 
oceans and water supplies as well?
These numbers may seem small compared to 
the trillions upon trillions of gallons which make 
up the oceans, estuaries, and wetlands but, 
over the years increased pollution is starting to 
seriously effect our ecosystems.
Take the summer of 1987, for example. 
Hundreds of tons of garbage and dead fish 
began to appear on U.S. beaches. In the 
summer of 1988 used hypodermic needles, 
surgical gloves, and other forms of medical 
waste started to wash up on eastern shorelines. 
Earlier this year, the U.S. was rocked by a series 
of coastal oil spills. These are just a few of the
mishaps which have occurred on U.S. shores, 
not even mentioning what has been happening 
on other country's coastlines.
Our beaches, estuaries, and wetlands must be 
saved not only for our own recreational use, but 
to save our environment and future as well.
This constant pollution not only affects the 
appearance of our coastline, but it affects our 
economy, our drinking water, the ozone layer, 
and the millions of animals that live in or near 
the coast as well. Something must  and can
 be done.
Oceans
For some odd reason human beings are 
attracted to water. More than half of the U.S. 
population  52.9 percent as of 1987  live 
within 50 miles of a coast, which makes up less 
than 10 percent of the nation's land. This 
serious overcrowding has been causing drastic 
pollution on America's saltwater shorelines.

Public 84,Is
If the extreme predictions are accurate, the 
globe is headed toward dramatic change. The 
Earth will warm faster than life can adapt, we 
will contaminate the few habitable areas left, 
and we will use up all the remaining minerals 
and energy resources within one lifetime.
Government can be a tool to protect nature as 
well as to regulate commerce and Industry. 
Politicians, however, have not always had 
ecology as their top priority, although public 
concern is moving environmental concerns 
higher on the political agenda. This year 
government at all levels is debating new public 
policy on the environment.
The Clean Air Act Amendments
President Bush proposed changes to the Clean 
Air Act this summer. Since Its enactment in 
1970, many more threats to the environment 
have been uncovered. In the last 20 years, 
global warming, acid rain, and ozone depletion 
have been identified as crises caused by 
pollutants in the air.
Originally, Bush's proposal dealt only with acid 
rain and urban pollution. In mid-November, a 
Senate committee amended the clean-air bill to 
require a phase-out of ozone-depleting 
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) by the year 2000. 
The centerpiece of the acid-rain legislation Is a 
credlts-trading system. The Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) would issue credits to 
any plant that reduced Its emissions to less than 
Its allowance, either by shutting down or 
cleaning up. Then It could sell the credits to any 
other plant, which could increase its limit by 
that amount.
To deal with urban pollution, Bush strongly 
endorsed the use of alternative fuels, such as 
methanol. But because the chairman of the 
House Energy and Commerce Committee, 
Representative John Dingell, is from Detroit, the 
automobile section of the bill may disappear.
Dingell was an original sponsor of Bush's bill. 
However, early in November, Dingell proposed 
a new plan which would have helped 
Midwestern utilities pay for scrubbers for their 
power plants by establishing a fee on 
emissions. In return, presumably, Midwestern 
congressmen would help weaken the auto 
emissions requirements of the bill. Congress 
intends to pass a clean air bill some time this 
year.
Recycling
A decade ago there were 18,500 landfills. Now 
there are 6,000  2,000 will probably close in 
the next five years. As garbage collection costs 
escalate, local governments are suddenly 
finding recycling of waste an attractive 
alternative to burying trash. And there's-plenty
of room for improvement. While only ten 
percent of U.S. trash is currently recycled, the 
Japanese recycle half of theirs.
State governments have a variety of policies to 
deal with the trash problem. Pennsylvania is 
one state which has used legislation to 
encourage recycling. New England states have, 
for many years, required deposits on all soda 
cans and bottles. West Virginia Is trying to 
decide between preserving its wilderness and 
making money burying urban waste.
This spring, recycling ran into a new problem: 
the newspaper glut. People are very willing to 
recycle their old newspapers, but for several 
reasons a dependable market for recycled paper 
has been slow In developing. Recycled paper, 
especially high-quality, tends to be expensive. 
Also, mills which produce paper tend to be near 
forests and far from cities which produce waste 
paper. To establish a recycled paper market, 
states like Connecticut have passed laws that 
will require recycled fibers to be used in 
newspapers circulated in that state.
Global Warming
At Congress's request, EPA head William Reilly 
attended a 68-natlon conference in the 
Netherlands on global warming. The United 
States and Japan were the only countries which 
would not commit themselves to the goal of 
stabilizing emissions of carbon dioxide. The 
U.S. produces 25 percent of the world's carbon 
dioxide. Increased levels of carbon dioxide In 
the atmosphere trap heat from the sun, 
warming the Earth.
Because the computer models which predict 
global climate trends are uncertain, the 
administration prefers a wait-and-see position. 
Unfortunately, it may take several years for 
carbon dioxide already In the air to start 
warming the Earth. Delays in action may 
aggravate the problem years from now.
Other Public Policy
Nearly every agency or branch of government 
Is making policies which affect the 
environment:
The State Department has proposed to the 
Senate the Antarctic Minerals Treaty, which 
would allow the exploration of Antarctica for oil 
and minerals and which the President supports. 
The Department of Energy has cut research In 
renewable energy by 85 percent and research In 
energy conservation by 75 percent.
Millions of gallons of oil were saved by 
government standards for fuel efficiency 
established in the 1970s. Under pressure from 
Ford and General Motors, the government 
lowered the standard from 27.5 miles per gallon 
to 26 miles per gallon.

There's five tons of carbon dioxide up there 
with your name on it.
Every year the United States alone emits 1.2 
billion tons  five tons per citizen  of carbon 
dioxide into the atmosphere. Although plants 
absorb some of this, the majority is released 
into the atmosphere. Every day we humans 
spew literally millions of tons of carbon dioxide 
(C02), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxides 
(S02), ground-level ozone, carbon monoxide, 
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), methane, and other 
pollutants Into the air, causing effects ranging 
from smog headaches to acid rain to global 
warming. For the convenience of powerful cars, 
air-conditioners, styrofoam packaging, cheap 
beef, paper, power, and ever-increasing 
industrial production of all kinds, we are rapidly 
suffocating ourselves and the rest of the Earth.
Undeniably, the problems of air pollution are 
global. The idea of taking individual actions 
against such a large scale problem may initially 
seem futile, but most of the problems of air 
pollution are cumulative. Large polluters such 
as coal burning plants, slash-and-burn farmers, 
and industrial producers emit a large share of 
pollutants, but so do our cars, inefficient light 
bulbs, television sets, and electric appliances. 
Reducing consumption of or exploring 
environmentally sound alternatives to almost 
any good or service will help alleviate the air 
pollution problem.
Global Warming
Global warming is a pressing air pollution 
issue. Global warming refers to the process 
whereby "greenhouse gases," including C02, 
CFCs, methane, ground-level ozone, and nitrous 
oxide collect in the atmosphere, forming a 
blanket which prevents infrared radiation from 
escaping into space, thus eventually warming 
the earth. Scientists estimate that atmospheric 
levels of all the greenhouse gases combined 
have increased from about 280 parts per million 
two hundred years ago to about 400 parts per 
million today.
Although scientists are.still squabbling about 
the extent of damage attributable to the 
greenhouse effect, the effect itself is a fact. 
Venus, with an atmosphere of 98 percent C02, 
would be 500 degrees cooler if it had an oxygen 
atmosphere. Although the Earth's atmosphere 
is only .03 percent C02, even a small rise in that 
percentage, especially when combined with 
other greenhouse gases, can have disastrous 
global effects.
By weight, carbon dioxide makes up about 70 
percent of the greenhouse gases, but causes 
only 50 percent of the warming. Another 20 to 
25 percent of the warming is caused by 
extremfely potent, completely man-made CFCs, 
and the remaining five to ten percent is caused 
primarily by methane, another greenhouse gas.
Climatologists predict that the planet could 
warm as much as nine degrees Fahrenheit by 
the year 2040 if human activity continues to 
Increase at Its present rate. Although this is a 
high estimate, even a rise of one or two degrees 
over such a short period could have drastic 
effects on weather patterns and sea levels 
around the globe. Shifting weather patterns 
could cause currently fertile areas to become 
barren deserts. Plants and animals would be 
forced to migrate northward to escape the heat
 and many would not be able to keep up.
Thermal expansion and the melting of polar ice 
caps and tundra regions would cause a 
significant rise in the sea level. Even in the 
moderate scenario of a three-foot rise In sea 
level, coastal cities like New York, San 
Francisco, and Copenhagen would face massive 
damage, the low-lying nation of Bangladesh 
would lose half its land area, and various Pacific 
Island nations would disappear completely. In 
the worst-case scenario of a six-and-one-half 
foot rise, most populated coastal areas would 
be completely submerged. Even the low-end 
scenarios predict salt water flooding into 
freshwater rivers, marshes, and delicate estuary 
regions which would devastate the precise 
balance required by the unique plants and 
animals which habitate those areas.
The majority of greenhouse gases enter the 
atmosphere from the combustion of fossil fuels. 
Cars, coal-burning power plants, industrial 
plants, and deforestation are the major culprits 
in carbon dioxide emissions. Deforestation, 
especially in rainforest areas, is particularly 
destructive, since the burning of trees and other 
vegetation not only releases huge amounts of 
carbon, but also reduces the carbon absorption 
capability of the planet. Deforestation alone 
causes ten percent of the greenhouse effect.
CFCs enter the atmosphere during the 
production of some polystyrene, from certain 
solvents, and through discarded refrigerators 
and air conditioners whose coolants are not 
properly recycled. Cities also exacerbate the 
greenhouse problem  large areas of concrete 
and blacktop create heat Islands five to nine 
degrees higher than surrounding areas, causing 
people to use more energy to run air 
conditioners and refrigerators. Municipal 
dumps and leaky gas pipes release methane.
Few scientists believe it is possible to reverse 
the damage already done to the atmosphere, 
but with a rigid program of reduced emissions 
and consumption in general, and a significantly 
increased emphasis on developing new, 
renewable energy technologies such as 
geothermal, solar, and wind power, many 
believe it will be possible to curb global 
warming before its effects are felt too deeply.

elimination. Aside from poachers, the animal's 
grazing lands are constantly being destroyed by 
developers and farmers. Government refuges 
are shrinking every year. Furthermore, the lack 
of available land for the refuges forces the 
governments to split up the reserves. According 
to Feigln, this leads to a serious problem for the 
elephants  Inbreeding.
Feigin says that since the refuges are divided up 
throughout the African continent, the herds in 
one refuge cannot mix and breed with the herds 
in another. Therefore, the elephants mate 
within their own herd season after season 
which leads to birth defects in the baby 
elephants and shorter life spans.
Another animal that faces extinction due to its 
own beauty is the Asian snow leopard. The 
leopard, which Inhabits the Himalayas in 
Central Asia at altitudes of up to 18,000 feet, is 
one of the most remarkable big cats In the 
world. Up to a dozen pelts may be used to make
one snow leopard coat, which can be sold for 
up to $30,000. Customs officials do not enforce 
laws restricting the export of these pelts.
But one should not think that only animals that 
are poached are In danger. The beautiful South 
American hyacinth macaw is often stolen from 
the nest as a baby and sold to a wealthy North 
American buyer as a pet for upwards of 
$10,000. Similar practices exist for rare 
butterflies, exotic fish, and playful monkeys.
Humans can no longer think of only themselves 
when considering environmental issues such as 
pollution and land preservation. The animals of 
the wild must also be taken Into account. The 
attention paid to the plight of the whale in the 
last 20 years Illustrates that people can help the 
wild. People now recognize that animals are not 
expendable, are still vanishing, and will 
continue to do so unless humans begin to 
understand that they are not alone.

Fur coats have long been thought of as 
glamorous status symbols. If you own a fur 
coat, you have style, or at least, money. 
However, that attitude has begun to change.
Anti-fur groups and other animal rights 
agencies have mounted full-scale campaigns 
to get people to stop buying and wearing fur 
coats. The primary argument against furs Is 
that the animals are killed in a brutal, 
inhumane manner. The groups contend that, 
whether trapped in the wild or raised on fur 
ranches, animals endure tremendous 
suffering.
Steel-jaw leg hold traps have been outlawed 
in certain areas of the country, but are still in 
use. The procedure is relatively simple. Traps 
are set, camouflaged, baited, and checked 
periodically. Once an animal is trapped, and 
If it is not already dead from the injury 
caused by the trap, hunger, or cold, then it is 
beaten, strangled, or stomped until it is dead.
The anti-fur groups charge that some terrorstricken animals are often In so much pain 
from the traps that they actually chew off the 
leg that has been caught. Trappers, however, 
contend that, due to overpopulation of 
certain animals, steel traps end the animal's 
life more humanely than the alternative of 
suffering from cold and starvation.
According to Beauty Without Cruelty USA, 10
to 24 foxes are killed for one full length coat 
and the same number of minks are needed 
for one coat.
The fur industry contends that it Is only 
serving the public's demand for fur. Some 
companies have begun to donate funds to 
animal conservation groups as well as other 
charity organizations. However, the anti-fur 
groups charge that such tactics are only an 
attempt to divert attention from the issue of 
animal cruelty. The groups charge that 
animals should not have to suffer and die 
simply to feed human vanity.
Over the past few years, fur buyers have had 
trouble shopping. On the streets of the posh 
shops of New York's Fifth Avenue, for 
example, protesters have staged organized 
marches demanding an end to fur trade. 
Even people who walk down the street 
wearing a fur coat have been taunted and 
Insulted by protesters.
According to Friends of Animals, fur sales 
have gradually declined in recent years. Last 
season, fur companies attributed the drop in 
sales to the stock market crash. When the 
market fell out, people could not affort 
certain luxury Items, fur being one. The fur 
industry expected the last quarter of 1989, 
specifically the Christmas season, to be a 
banner season. However, 1989 has yet to 
prove to be a "good year" for the fur trade.

Animals are the greatest victims of man's 
carelessness and greed. Dozens of species all 
over the world, in the water and on land, are 
being killed and in some cases slaughtered in 
vast numbers. The reasons for the killings vary, 
but whether direct or Indirect, some of the 
Earth's most Interesting and beautiful creatures 
are vanishing.
A common indirect means of elimination is 
through the destruction or pollution of habitat. 
Pesticides, industrial pollution, and humans' 
constant need to spread out and convert land 
for their own purposes has driven many species 
to extinction. Many environmental groups insist 
that industry and farmers, though their main 
intention is not to destroy animals but rather to 
utilize land, take nature into account when 
clearing land or spraying crops.
One animal that has suffered tremendously 
from infringement on its habitat is the 
loggerhead sea turtle. The turtles live in the 
waters off Florida's east coast and the 
Caribbean. The female turtles lay their eggs on 
land, especially on the beaches along the 
Florida coast and the Caribbean islands. 
According to Barbara Feigln, a volunteer for the 
New York Zoological Society, developers have 
destroyed many of the turtles' nesting areas 
because of the value of these beach front 
properties. Furthermore, since the turtles only 
come ashore to lay their eggs at night, the 
lights from buildings and cars frighten them 
away and prevent the females from laying their 
eggs. "The females always come back to the 
beach they were born on and they will lay their 
eggs only on that beach," said Felgin. If the 
turtle is unable to nest on that beach, she will 
simply drop the eggs out of her body while In 
the ocean, where they will never hatch, said 
Felgin. The fertilized eggs will continually be 
"dumped" in the ocean and lost, season after 
season.
Another means of indirect destruction Involves 
the killing of sea turtles and dolphins in the nets 
of commercial fishermen. Turtles often get 
caught in the shrimp nets of shrimpers along 
the Gulf Coast. However, a device called a turtle 
excluder device (TED), which is essentially a 
trap door built into the net, allows the turtle to 
escape.
Opposition to using the TEDs by shrimpers is 
based on fears that the mechanism Is expensive 
and will lead to a lower shrimp yield. However, 
research has proved that when properly fitted
and used, the TEDs have no affect on the catch. 
According to the Caribbean Conservation 
Corporation, the devices cost from $100 to 
$450. A federal law was put Into effect earlier 
this year requiring Gulf Coast shrimpers to use 
TEDs, but U.S. Commerce Secretary Robert 
Mosbacher suspended the regulations due to 
pressure from the industry.
Dolphins have been killed at the huge rate of 
almost 200,000 a year by fishermen In search of 
other catches. Dolphins swim with schools of 
yellowfin tuna, a prized catch for tuna 
fishermen. However, according to Friends of 
Animals, the dolphins are not being mistakenly 
caught up In the nets as the sea turtles are. 
Dolphins are a useful tool for finding the 
schools of tuna. When the dolphins come up for 
air, they are spotted by the fishermen and 
followed. Underwater explosives stun the tuna 
and dolphin alike and they are all hauled up In a 
huge net. The dolphins are thus no more than 
expendable "tuna detectors."
The direct means of animal destruction, the 
hunting and harvesting of animals for sport or 
commercial use, are more well known.
Certain animals, such as the African elephant 
and the Asian snow leopard, are being driven to 
extinction because of their commercial value. 
The tusks of the elephant and the pelts of the 
leopard are highly prized in certain fashion 
cultures. Even though these and other species 
are classified as "endangered," poachers still 
kill thousands of varieties of endangered 
species every year.
According to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), 
the African elephant population has plunged 
from 1.3 million to barely 625,000 in just ten 
years because of the desire for ivory. Many 
African nations have reacted by stepping up 
anti-poachlng efforts. President Daniel arap Mol 
of Kenya recently set fire to over $3 million 
worth of seized tusks in a public ceremony to 
demonstrate his country's commitment to the 
fight to preserve the elephant. Also, several 
countries, including the United States, have 
banned ivory Imports.
However, other countries and cultures still 
value raw ivory. Poaching still continues and a 
pound of Ivory Is valued at over $100. WWF 
estimates that the world wholesale trade of raw 
ivory is almost $130 million a year.
The elephant is also one of those animals that 
suffers both from direct and Indirect

---------------------------------------------------

Ozone Depletion
Ozone depletion is closely related to and often 
confused with the greenhouse effect. 
Atmospheric ozone creates a shield which 
blocks ultraviolet rays from reaching the earth. 
Scientists have recently detected several large 
"tears" in the ozone layer. The ultraviolet 
radiation which reaches the Earth through these 
tears damages the immune systems of plants 
and animals, causing crop damage and 
increased incidence of disease, Including 
cancer, in animals and people.
Ozone depletion occurs when CFCs break down 
in sunlight. The free chlorine radical reacts with 
the ozone, breaking it down in turn. Since it 
takes at least twenty years for CFCs to reach the 
ozone layer, depletion will continue for years 
after all use has stopped.
If ozone depletion is not halted, It will become 
impossible for many people to go outdoors 
without risking severe sunburn and skin cancer. 
Crop damage could exacerbate the hunger
problems of third world nations, and perhaps 
even disrupt the food supply in the first world 
by reducing crop yields. Trees and other carbon 
absorbing plants would also suffer increased 
disease. New plant epidemics could wipe out 
whole populations of some species. Finally, the 
basis of the entire oceanic food chain, plankton, 
would probably also decline, causing further 
food shortages.
Most industrial nations, including the United 
States, signed an agreement in Montreal in 
1987 to reduce CFC production below 1986 
levels by the year 2000. Many nations have 
expressed a willingness to ban the chemicals 
altogether. Alternative polystyrene production 
methods are already in use, and new CFC-free 
coolants are being developed.
Acid Rain
Acid rain is caused by the transformation of 
NOx and sulfur dioxide into acids in the 
atmosphere. These acids can travel hundred of 
miles before being deposited in the soil or
sno2&iolAdo.
Plant a tree! Trees absorb C02 and help cool 
buildings, reducing the need to use airconditioners. One cooling shade tree can cause 
reductions In C02 emissions equal to 15 times 
the amount the tree can absorb alone. 
Carpool, take the bus, ride a bicycle, 
walk. Your car is a major producer of 
pollutants. When you replace your car, buy a 
model which gets at least forty-five miles to the 
gallon to cut C02 emissions. Ask your mechanic 
about Installing emissions control devices on 
your car.
Turn down your hot water heater 130
degrees is as hot as you'll ever need it.
Write to your congressman, governor, and 
other political figures about the pressing 
demands of the environment. Also, write to 
manufacturers and merchants about your 
packaging and production preferences  they 
produce to meet market demand  and make 
them live up to your expectations. Tell them 
you want more fuel efficient cars, less 
packaging, stricter emissions controls. 
Recycle. Glass, paper, aluminum are all easily 
recycled. Plastics and other materials may be 
recyclable soon. The energy you save from 
recycling just one aluminium can will power 
your television set for three hours.
Avoid heavily packaged products, 
styrofoam, and aerosols. Heavy paper 
packaging contributes to deforestation, plastics 
deplete our fossil fuel reserves, styrofoams 
deplete the ozone. Frozen and processed foods
require significantly more energy to produce 
than fresh foods. Out of season foods require 
lots of energy to transport them from exotic 
locales. Buy fresh, in season, local fruits and 
vegetables, and minimally packaged local 
meats and baked goods.
Reuse. Mend broken Items and clothes. Reuse 
containers and other packaging you might 
usually throw away. Donate discards.
Check solvents. Find out if the solvent you 
plan to use contains CFCs. Purchase a CFC-free 
alternative Instead.
Recycle coolants. When your alr-conditioner 
or refrigerator needs to be fixed or discarded, 
take It to a servicing center which recycles the 
coolant.
Grow plants. Studies show that plants 
absorb harmful pollutants from office air. They 
also absorb C02 and produce healthful oxygen. 
Ask your company to Investigate possible 
sources of fumes and to look Into modifications 
of ventilation systems. If your company is 
moving, ask management to consider a 
building with windows that open to provide 
fresh air and ventilation.
Turn it off. Turn off lights, appliances, and 
anything else you're not using.
Replace your incandescent bulbs with 
new, highly efficient fluorescent bulbs. 
They fit in standard sockets, provide the same 
amount of light for a quarter the energy, and 
last about ten times as long. In the lifetime of 
one bulb you will save about 25 dollars.5

water in the form of rain, snow, gas, or dust. 
Acid rain was first noted in 1872 by English 
scientist Robert Angus Smith, who coined the 
term and was the first to note acid rain's 
detrimental effect on plants and materials. The 
phenomenon has been studied and 
documented ever since.
Normal rain falls at 5.6 on the pH scale, while 
acid rain generally ranges from about four to 
five pH. Since the pH scale Is logarithmic, rain 
with a pH of four is 40 times more acidic than 
normal rain. Although the worst acid rain 
problems are found in Europe and the 
northeastern U.S., fog rating as low as three pH 
has been recorded In southern California.
Acid rain can have devastating effects on 
forests, aquatic areas, and buildings. Aquatic 
areas are particularly hard hit by acid rain. Low 
pH levels impair the ability of female fish, frogs, 
and reptiles to produce viable eggs, and may 
impair the metabolisms of mature animals as 
well. Acid rain also dissolves toxic metals such 
as manganese, mercury and aluminum In the 
soil, which then accumulate in lakes and 
streams and threaten both animal and plant life. 
These metals move up the food chain through 
fish and aquatic vegetation to humans and 
other animals with detrimental effects. It is 
difficult to guage the current extent and 
possible rate of acid rain damage due to the 
varying ability of lakes to buffer acidity and to 
recover from an acidic state.
In the forest, acid rain leaches nutrients from 
the soil and foliage, inhibits photosynthesis, 
kills essential microorganisms, and mobilizes 
toxic metals. Some scientists attribute the 
phenomenon of forest dieback, where a section 
of a thriving forest suddenly dies, to acid rain. 
Once again, some forests seem better equipped 
to neutralize acid rain, while areas such as 
northeastern America, with its extremely fragile 
soil, are harder hit.
Buildings and statues are also subject to acid 
rain damage. Statues lose their features, and 
limestone, marble, galvanized steel, and 
carbonate-based paints can all weaken in acid 
rain. Acid rain's effects on humans have not 
been determined, but toxic trace metals In food 
are never healthful.

Most S02ln this country is produced by highsulfur content coal-burning plants in the 
Midwest. NOx is also produced during these 
processes, and during fossil fuel combustion in 
general.
Prior to the 1970 Clean Air Act, sulfur dioxide 
and nitrogen oxide emissions were rising 
steadily. Sulfur emissions have been cut by 
about aquarter, while nitrogen oxide emissions 
have increased about ten percent since the act 
went into effect. Technology Is available to
cleaner plants and retrofit older plants with 
scrubbers and other emission control devices. 
Grandfather clauses In the act, however, allow 
older plants to conform to lower emissions 
standards, thus giving utilities no incentive to 
build the newer, more efficient, but more 
expensive plants.
Many European nations have agreed to reduce 
their sulfur dioxide emissions by 30 percent by 
1993, and are Investigating methods to control 
NOx as well. The U.S. and Canada have recently 
agreed to study emissions control technology 
and to work together to curb the acid rain 
problem. These measures, however, seem weak 
In light of the available technologies and 
alternatives. Acid rain is an air pollution 
problem which can probably be controlled with 
stricter emissions regulation and required 
installation of emissions control technology.
Smog and Indoor Pollution
Smog, a familiar element in city life, is a sickly 
brownish haze of ozone and carbon monoxide 
that descends over the city and surrounding 
areas  especially during those Indian summer 
inversions. Aside from being unpleasant, smog 
can actually kill. People with asthma, heart 
conditions, allergies, the elderly, children, and 
those who exercise strenuously are particularly 
subject to respiratory difficulties and heart 
malfunctions during periods of high smog. 
Some may experience headaches, eye irritation, 
coughing spells, or difficulty breathing. High 
ozone concentrations also reduce vegetable 
crop yields, with tomato yield falling about 30 
percent, and green beans about 25 percent.
Ground level ozone is produced by reactions 
between NOx and volatile organic compounds 
(VOCs). Fossil fuel combustion provides both 
these ingredients as a product. Gasoline and 
chemical solvent vapors are additional sources 
of VOCs.
Indoor pollution is Increasingly recognized as a 
health threat. Formaldehyde, asbestos, and 
radon gas are particularly menacing 
carcinogens found indoors, but chemical fumes 
from other building materials, photocopier 
toner, and other sources are also endangering 
people's health every time they go to work.
Many people who work in buildings where the 
windows do not open suffer headaches, eye 
problems, respiratory difficulties, and increased 
incidence of viral illness stemming from 
breathing polluted air In their buildings. 
Inadequate ventilation and toxic building 
materials are often to blame. The effects of this 
type of pollution are only beginning to be 
studied.

Almost every day, people are confronted with a 
flow of Information about business practices 
and products that harm the environment. The 
Earth has been noticeably affected since the 
industry boom. Many large companies, in an 
effort to save money and reap high profits, take 
shortcuts that can harm the environment. The 
greenhouse effect, acid rain, ozone depletion, 
oil spills, and deforestation are a few such 
problems that have been getting attention 
lately. These problems, however, can be 
controlled to some extent If big business and 
individuals work together.
Many practices  ranging from production 
techniques to packaging  have adverse effects 
on the environment. Some companies graze 
cattle on public lands or cleared rain forest 
lands. MAXXAM has made a practice of cutting 
down rare Redwood trees to finance its 
business. Other companies are deforesting land 
unchecked. Also, toxic waste dumps are ruining 
good land and polluting fresh water supplies. 
Other companies unnecessarily kill animals 
through experimentation or unethical collecting 
procedures.
The most controversial packaging material is 
styrofoam, a form of polystyrene. Products 
made of polystyrene are not biodegradable, 
give off toxic fumes when burned in 
incinerators, and contribute to the 
overburdening of landfills. Made from 
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), polystyrenes 
deplete the ozone layer, contribute to skin 
cancer and cataracts, and damage crops.
People may wonder what they can do to help 
stem these harmful practices. Consumers can 
vote with their dollars and influence companies 
to stop unsound environmental practices. 
Boycotting products from businesses that are 
not environmentally sensitive contributes to a 
growing movement to push companies to 
address environmental issues. If enough people 
contribute, as in any vote, the impact will be felt 
by the company involved. This method of 
consumer pressure has been effective in a 
variety of different political areas, in addition to 
environmental concerns. There have been 
many successful boycotts which have helped 
save forest land, whales, and other endangered 
environments. Recent boycotts have targeted 
companies including MAXXAM, Scott Paper, 
Burger King, Coors, Gillette, Coca-Cola, Guess 
Jeans, Shell, Morton Salt, General Electric, 
TWA, Benetton, Exxon, Heinz, and Ralston 
Purina for offenses such as animal testing or 
killing, and rain forest destruction, as well as 
other issues not concerning the environment.
For more detailed Information, check out the 
JtieHJ Ie0hett ,Akg a publication of the 
Institute for Consumer Responsibility.
As a consumer, you can also reduce your use of 
environmentally unsafe products. Aerosol cans, 
for example, are dangerous. Freon, the most 
popular propellant, destroys the atmosphere. 
Even Isobutane, propane, and butane (used to 
replace freon) pose a danger to the heart and 
central nervous system. Pump action sprays are 
the best to use If any spray is necessary.
In the home, handle and dispose of harsh 
chemicals carefully. The chemicals In drain 
cleaners can be countered by pouring boiling 
water down drains once a week. Some products 
can be poured down the drain with plenty of 
water, including cleaners for aluminum, drains, 
toilet bowls, tube and tile; disinfectants; perm 
chemicals; nail polish and remover; antifreeze, 
glue, paint stripper, rust remover, and 
photographic chemicals. Remember that certain 
products such as transmission fluid, batteries, 
gasoline, fuel oil and kerosene, paint thinner, 
and turpentine are recyclable.
By being a conscientious shopper, you can 
protect yourself from some harmful products. In 
the home, there are many "quick fix" products 
that can be replaced by safer, more natural, and 
effective methods:
Room fresheners can be replaced by pomades 
(made from citrus fruits decorated with cloves 
and ribbons) or potpourri.
A mixture of lemon juice and salt or baking 
soda cleans brass and copper, while apple cider 
vinegar works on chrome. Silver can be soaked 
in boiling water with baking soda, salt, and a 
piece of aluminum foil.
Use homemade all-purpose cleaners. Add 1/2 
cup white vinegar, 2 tablespoons cornstarch 
and one gallon warm water together or just 
three tablespoons borax for every three cups of 
warm water. Baking soda can be used to clean 
toilets and white vinegar will clean sinks, tubs, 
and countertops. Mold and mildew will yield to 
borax and water.
Try sprinkling cornstarch on rugs and 
upholstery to clean, then vacuum.
Eliminate plastics by using paper and glass. If 
you do buy products with 6-pack plastic yokes 
or netting, cut them up before you discard them 
because, when discarded, animals and fish 
swallow them and die.
Replace rock salt with unscented cat litter for 
icy walks.
Use laundry detergents that are phosphate-free 
and contain biodegradable surfactants.

When you buy food, you are supporting the

A Coke
 In 1985 Coca-Cola bought 200,000 acres of 
subtropical moist forest, a significant hunk of 
the small Central American nation of Belize, to 
grow oranges for its Minute Maid brand of 
juice. Coke had been buying oranges from 
Brazil, where the groves were planted on 
destroyed rainforests. After protests by 
conservationists and a )D WiHRt,k segment, the 
Atlanta-based company agreed to preserve 
166,000 acres and to limit the use of chemicals 
on the oranges.
 In 1986 Coke introduced the "plastic can," a 
non-recyclable container which looked like an 
aluminum can. After outrage from communities 
and recyclers who worried that the plastic cans 
would end up among aluminum cans, ruining 
the recycling market. Coke pulled the product. 
More recently, however, Coke introduced a 10- 
ounce, non-recyclable, plastic bottle.

A Hamburger
 Much of the South American rainforest has 
been destroyed to clear land for grazing cattle, 
which Is almost exclusively used for 
hamburger. Cleared rainforest land is so poor it 
can support grazing for only a few years. After it 
is abandoned, full regrowth of the forests takes 
hundreds of years. Through this practice,
Brazil's beef production has surpassed the 
United States'.
 After months of protests in 1986 and 1987, 
Burger King agreed not to import any more 
beef from Latin America. McDonalds maintains 
that its beef is all-American. This is impossible 
to verify because the U. S. government does 
not require the country of origin be stamped on 
imported beef.
 Most American cattle are fed steroids to 
promote fast growth. The European Economic 
Community has banned the import of beef 
produced with these hormones. The U.S. claims 
that the meat is safe, and that Europeans are. 
merely banning American beef to protect their 
market. The Europeans, however, maintain that 
the meat poses a health risk.
 The beef industry requires large quantities of 
land and water compared with other food 
products. Though inefficient as a food source, 
beef accounts for nearly a fifth of all agricultural 
income  $30 billion annually. And because we 
import half of the 110 pounds we each eat every 
year, beef adds billions to the trade deficit.

French Fries
 Some potatoes are produced with sulfites, a 
group of preservatives, which can be found in 
some grapes, wines, and salad bar vegetables. 
They produce allergic reactions In some 
people. Public concern about sulfites rose in 
the mid-1980s after they were linked to several 
deaths. The FDA was slow to ban the use of 
sulfites on foods, especially, fresh potatoes. 
Because of loopholes in the regulations, sulfites 
are still used on potato products.

and much more than had ever been covered in 
law before. The steel mills pledged their 
support making the law feasible.
From then on every year in the history of 
Pittsburgh is dotted with air pollution measures. 
The city has come a long way from the days of 
not being able to see down Boulevard of the 
Allies. Pittsburgh is 97 percent cleaner than it 
was prior to smoke control.
Maybe the name "Smokey City" can finally be 
put to rest.

to U.S. forest issues.
A specific example of severe destruction is the 
timber program in Alaska's Tongass National 
Forest, the country's largest national forest. 
According to a report on federal timber 
management in southeast Alaska put out by the 
Wilderness Society, "75 percent of this land will 
either be logged outright, or disturbed by 
environmentally disruptive logging roads." The 
dissection of forest with logging roads will 
effectively result in the destruction of its entire 
ecosystem.
Much of the concern for the loss of virgin forest 
is directed toward the extinction of valuable 
plants and animals. Where has this concern 
been for U.S. forests which also contain many 
endangered animals?
High Mileage
According to O3, ,A UeyN Oix,k (5/23/89), 
"Brazil defied its critics by declaring that it 
would proceed with plans for a highway linking 
the Amazon Basin to the Pacific." Yet since 
those critics are mostly in the U.S., it is ironic to 
note that Brazil was simply following a 
precedent set by the U.S.
All roads used for logging U.S. National Forests 
are built by the National Forestry Service. They 
alone have created 360,000 miles of road  by 
comparison, the U.S. interstate highway system 
has 44,000 mileswhereas the milage of J 
roads (federal, state, and local) in the much 
larger Amazon region is less than 30,000.
The difference between the two country's 
systems is that the U.S. logging roads are 
completely funded by the National Forestry 
Service (and thus U.S. tax dollars), whereas 
Brazil is seeking funding for its new highway 
from foreign nations, primarily Japan.
Exporting to Japan?
Japan's increasing economic investment in 
Brazil's natural resources, at the expense of 
world environmental safety, is another point of 
criticism in recent articles. A Oix,k article 
states "The region currently provides only 5 
percent of the world's trade in tropical timber," 
but then suggests that building a road from Rio 
Branco to the Pacific Coast would, "provide a 
new and shorter supply route for the world's 
largest consumer of tropical hardwood [Japan]" 
(2/19/89).
The article is presented in terms of 
environmental concern for the Amazon region, 
but what is not mentioned in the Oix,k article is 
that the US. is a major supplier of timber to 
Japan. Lou Gold, from the Oregon Siskiyou 
RegionaLEducatlon Project, explains, "While 
the U.S. produced 10 billion board feet for its 
own consumption last ye.a.r, |tfirpilncefi(aipother 
six billion for export to Japan." Lumbering is a
primary industry in the Pacific Northwest region 
of the U.S. whereas nut collecting and rubber 
tapping remain the primary economic activity in 
Brazil's Amazon region.
Federal Subsidies
"Official subsidies of the last decade have made 
ranching in the Amazon artificially profitable," 
stated a Oix,k article, adding that between 
1975 and 1986 over a billion dollars of subsidies 
were given to Brazilian ranchers and settlers (3/ 
23/89).
But similar subsidy programs exist in the U.S. 
on a larger scale. Tax payers are taking huge 
losses on federally funded programs for the 
lumber industry. The forest management, not 
only, "causes annual losses due to sale 
preparation, road design, and road construction 
costs . . . [but also] continually offered timber 
for sale where there is no apparent market 
demand." (Wilderness Society report).
"The Forest Service has an annual budget 
deficit of over $1 billion. This loss does not 
include the replacement cost value of the oldgrowth timber sold, damaged or wasted," 
states the "ey,kt aeih,o Such amounts lost 
annually equal the Brazilian government 
subsidies over the eleven year period.
Other problems arise from such subsidies 
because they encourage the depletion of 
remaining resources rather than conservation. 
As one World Bank publication indicates about 
Brazil, Although it is technically possible to 
recuperate degraded pastures, the continued 
availability of tax credit funds for land clearing, 
road and fence building, and pasture 
development makes it more profitable for a 
corporation to form new pastures than to 
maintain existing ones."
The problems that Brazil face are similar to 
those caused by U.S. lumber industry subsidies. 
According to O3, ;HH,y aeih, (Summer, 1989), 
corporations in the Northwest "like Champion 
International, Weyerhause, and Georgia-Pacific.
.. have liquidated [their] old growth  exported 
much of it, and now demand timber from 
federal forests to keep their mills open." In 
addition to putting large mills in direct 
competition for federal timber with smaller 
mills who don't have their own forest land, this 
sort of federally subsidized timbering makes it 
more profitable for corporations to use up 
existing federally "protected" virgin forest land 
instead of replanting and reharvesting their 
own land.
A common argument for the widespread U.S. 
lumber subsidies is that they increase 
employment in economically repressed areas 
like the Pacific Northwest. But, with the aid of 
modern lumbering techniques, "[tree] cutting 
levels over the past five years have'incteased

CMU teaches us to be efficient in our future 
careers, and it forces us to be efficient students 
now. While the workload seems like a burden, 
there is one area where your newly-acquired 
sense of efficiency can pay off  energy.
Few issues require more public knowledge or 
have the potential to play a larger role in this 
nation's successful expansion during the 
coming years than the efficient use of energy. In 
addition to the energy required to run 
computers, computers, and computers, 
thousands of dollars are spent less 
constructively on drafty windows, excessive 
lighting, and extravagant consumption of 
energy. This money could easily be diverted to 
more rewarding areas with a few relatively 
simple changes and improved awareness.
When most of us consider energy efficiency, we 
envision 25-second cold showers or freezing in 
a dim room with ten layers of clothing on. 
Although these measures certainly would save 
energy, extreme steps are not necessary. With 
current technology, substantial energy gains 
can occur with little or no sacrifice In 
performance or comfort. Although innovations 
may cost slightly more initially, they quickly pay 
for themselves in saved energy and labor. In 
short, previously unthinkable decisions have 
become plausible and even profitable.
These changes have enabled Carnegie Mellon 
to implement a policy that Physical Plant's 
director of engineering, Joe Moldel, calls 
"invisible efficiency"  taking actions that 
conserve energy while maintaining or 
improving performance, resulting in changes 
that go unnoticed everywhere but in the 
budget. Institutionally, this policy has pushed 
us in the right direction and produced an 
abundance of energy-saving practices. In spite 
of this progress, however, Carnegie Mellon 
must take a variety of steps to keep up in the 
future.
Lighting
More than 20 percent of all electricity generated 
in the United States Is used for lighting. Long 
hours of campus operation and emergency 
lighting make lighting one of CMU's biggest 
energy expenses. New developments have 
brought about a virtual revolution in lighting 
efficiency, and CMU can begin to cash in now:
Incandescent lights could be replaced by 
compabt fliiorbsfcfehWu'lbs. One 18-watt
compact fluorescent bulb emits the same light 
as a 75-watt incandescent bulb, and lasts ten 
times longer. In addition to saving nearly 30 
dollars per bulb on electric bills, the expense 
and labor of nine bulb changes can be avoided. 
When you multiply these figures for the 
thousands of bulbs on campus, the savings are 
astounding.
Reflectors behind light sources to focus and to 
magnify light can significantly reduce required 
bulb wattage.
Ballasts, which provide bursts of energy to 
turn on fluorescent lights, could be updated 
with new solid-state, computer-controlled 
models, providing significant energy savings.
Increased use of motion sensors and timers in 
classrooms and offices would allow us to 
efficiently control energy consumption with no 
extra burden on the custodial staff.
Heating and Insulation
Carnegie Mellon's major objective is preparing 
Its students for the future through education. 
Judging from the toasty temperatures in Hunt 
Library and the Student Offices in Skibo, it is 
clear that CMU doesn't want global warming to 
take us by surprise. Energy literally leaks from 
our campus in ways that could be easily 
avoided.
Malfunctioning thermostats represent the 
most annoying waste of energy on our campus. 
They reduce the classroom experience to a 
sweaty, draining ordeal, throw away money 
that could have been used to improve student 
life, and could be easily repaired.
The Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory estimates 
that heat loss from windows is responsible for 
over four percent of our national energy 
consumption  the equivalent of 1.4 million 
barrels of oil per day. Carnegie Mellon's old 
buildings contribute substantially to this figure. 
Most of our current windows have an Insulating 
efficiency near R-1. If we invest in new 
Insulating windows, our efficiency could be 
Increased to R-12, better than conventional 
walls.
Other Institutional Ways of Reducing 
Energy Output

Growing concern over Brazil's timbering of hard 
woods for export and burning of forest for beefcattle grazing land has elevated it to a "world 
crisis."
Brazilian rain forest destruction contributes tq 
the greenhouse effect by increasing ozonedeteriorating gases, the extinction of several 
potentially useful plant and animal species each 
week, and the loss of the world's largest oxygen 
producing forest. But many of these arguments, 
have been shown to be misleading, if not false. 
For instance, recent evidence shows that the 
forest's complex ecosystem actually uses as 
much oxygen as it produces, thus no oxygen is 
lost by burning or timbering.
A scan of the CMU on-line catalog shows over 
50 newspaper articles on the U.S.'s increasing 
environmental concern about the destruction of 
Brazilian rain forests in the last two years. Many 
of the articles present various solutions to the 
problems by the U.S., other western nations, 
and the World Bank. These include stopping 
World Bank aid for the planned cross-Amazon 
highway; making foreign aid conditional on 
environmental action; buying Brazilian debt to 
set up national parks; and attempting to show 
that traditional harvests of rubber and nuts 
benefit the Brazilians more than timbering and 
burning.
But many of these proposals have proven to be 
unsuccessful: funding withdrawn from the 
World Bank seems likely to be matched by 
Japan; the conditional foreign aid was seen as 
openly challenging Brazil's sovereignty and has
been greatly resisted; the complex negotiations 
to buy Brazilian debt in exchange for setting up 
national park land not only tackled such a small 
portion of the debt that it seemed useless, but 
also created parks that were later discovered to 
exist only on paper.
Many journalists cite Brazil's resistance to 
solutions suggested by the U.S. as a key part of 
the problem. Perhaps the problem lies not so 
much with Brazil's treatment of its resources as 
it does with the approach U.S. journalists have 
taken to the situation. Rather than an 
environmental crisis, the situation in Brazil can 
be seen as a series of economical solutions 
which predominantly follow the footsteps of 
U.S. policies towards its own national 
resources.
It is interesting that a similar library scan on 
U.S. forests alone showed no ,A UeyN Oix,k 
articles. What follows is a comparison of points 
raised in recent Oix,k articles concerning both 
the Brazillan-Amazon rain forest and U.S. forest 
land.
Forest Destruction
The most discussed area in the Amazon is 
Brazil's Rononia, which, as of 1987, had 
deforested 17 percent of its land. (Times 8/12/
88) This parallels the larger estimates that 
"between 15 and 20 percent of the Amazon's 
primary forest has been cleared." (Times 2/19/
89) While this is cause for alarm, it is negligible 
compared to the amount of U.S. virgin forest 
that has been destroyed: about 95 percent,

Although our society isn't as attached to the 
natural world as the tribal cultures which exist 
in the tropical rain forests of the world, 
environmental problems such as global 
warming have forced us to take a closer look at 
the state of the ecosystem in the world. The 
importance of trees in this ecosystem is not 
only their use of carbon dioxide and production 
of oxygen; trees can also be used to reduce 
high temperatures in urban areas. Rain forests 
also provide a home for tribal societies, as well 
as many species of animals and plants.
The alarming rate at which the rain forests of 
Africa, Asia, Central America, and South 
America are being cut has provoked 
environmental groups and scientists to call for 
action. Last April in Brazil, President Jose 
Sarney released survey data stating that five 
percent of the Amazon basin had been 
destroyed by deforestation. According to the 
Rainforest Action Network, all the primary rain 
forests in India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and 
Haiti have been destroyed already. Half of the 
world's rain forests are gone, and every minute 
100 acres are cut or burned. The National 
Academy of Science estimates that at least 50 
million acres of rain forest are lost every year. 
The loss results in the displacement of people 
and animals who live in the rain forests.
In addition to the loss of large percentages of 
tribal populations, vegitation with potential 
nutritional and medical purposes has been 
destroyed. The trees of the rainforests hold 
most of the nutrients necessary for plant life in 
their leaves and vegetation; the soil itself is a 
slightly sandy base that holds no nutrients, so it 
is difficult to raise trees on it again when the 
forest land is gone.
Jay D. Hair, president of the National Wildlife 
Federation, asserted the importance of the rain 
forest vegitation in a recent speech to the 
federation. His daughter, who was dying of 
cancer four years ago, was saved by a medicine 
derived from a plant species called the rosy 
periwinkle. The plant was native to Madagascar, 
an island country near the coast of Africa. Most 
of Madagascar's forests have been destroyed. 
"One hundred percent of the native habitat of 
the rosy periwinkle is gone forever," said Hair. 
"And just at a time when we're learning about 
the marvels of technology."
Deforestation has a different meaning in this 
country. Gerry Gray, director of resource policy 
for the American Forestry Association, explains 
the difference by discouraging "the 
misconception that all forestlands are managed 
under one philosophy." While forests 
designated as national parks and wilderness 
areas are more or less left to nature, 
management of forest land which exists as a 
small-scale ecosystem involves more active 
management. "We're planting more,ip [these!
past few years than we ever have before," said 
Gray. For every acre harvested, in two years 
another acre of forestland is regenerated. We 
need this regeneration because, according to 
Global ReLeaf, a program of the American 
Forestry Association, we as a nation produce 
about 25 percent of the annual global carbon 
dioxide caused by burning fossil fuels The 
reason for this regeneration is the emphasis on 
environmental concerns In residential and 
urban areas.
The American Forestry Association has 
"designated 100 million urban tree planting 
sites," said Gray. The ultimate goal of Global 
ReLeaf is to get those trees planted and 
encourage people to plant trees near their 
houses. Trees planted in an urban area reduce 
the "heat island" effect, the six to 10 degree 
Farenheit temperature difference between 
central urban areas and surrounding rural 
areas. Trees filter some air pollution and hold 
heat once held in by air pollution and buildings. 
Trees planted on the southwest side of a house 
can reduce the cost of air conditioning by 10 to 
50 percent by shading it and improve the 
quality of underground water supplies. Trees 
also help to control soil erosion and to prevent 
flooding. They reduce noise pollution. Last but 
not least, trees reduce the amount of carbon 
dioxide by returning it as oxygen during 
photosynthesis.
So where does all this leave you?
Avoid fast food hamburgers and processed 
beef products. Rainforest Action Network 
reports that the U.S. imports 120 million 
pounds of beef from Central American 
countries where two-thirds of the rainforests 
have been cleared to raise cattle to provide 
stringy, inexpensive meat for the U.S. food 
industry.
Avoid buying stone-washed jeans because, 
according to the Jemez Action Group, forests 
are destroyed to stripmine for pumice. Almost a 
third of this lightweight volcanic rock mined is 
used to make stonewashed clothing of all kinds. 
Plant a tree. Every bit helps.
Recycle. Every ton of paper recycled saves 17 
trees.
Write to public officials.

pressure is no longer valid. Current energy 
efficient showerheads pump air into the water 
flow and provide a stream equivalent to 
standard showerheads.
In order to fully consider the long-run 
economic implications of our purchases, energy 
efficiency should be a major criteria in our 
appliance purchasing.
This is by no means an exhaustive list. It is 
merely an inkling of the tremendous 
advantages to be had through energy 
efficiency. Not only does energy efficiency 
make economic sense, but it is closely related 
to environmental degradation, from which no 
path promises more relief in the future than 
energy conservation.
Consider the fact that, according to The Nuclear 
Information and Resource Service, a national 
least-cost energy planning policy will 
significantly reduce the burdens on the 
environment that the electric utility industry 
now produces: 68 percent of the sulfur ^io^ide

gases linked to the greenhouse effect, and more 
than half of all nuclear waste. In addition, 
Americans constitute five percent of the world's 
population, yet use 28 percent of the world's 
energy. Clearly, something is wrong, and we 
can't continue this way forever. Responsibly 
changing our personal energy consumption 
habits is the only way that we, as individuals 
within a community, can work toward a stable 
future.
Some easy steps you can take to contribute to 
energy savings include turning off lights when 
not in use, wearing more clothes instead of 
cranking up the heat, and taking short showers. 
Additionally, if you find yourself studying in a 
pool of sweat, call Physical Plant at x2910. If 
there are any blatant heat leaks in your area, 
report them, too. It will make you more 
comfortable and will save money for the 
university, diverting it to sources designed to 
serve you. Finally, if you have any ideas 
concerning energy conservation that should be 
addressed by students, or if you would like to

People sense that our planet is in trouble, but 
most feel helpless in the face of such awesome 
threats as global warming, ozone holes, rain 
forest destruction, and other worldwide 
problems.
Earth Day 1990 is being organized to 
overcome this sense of despair. It is rooted in 
the belief that people  individually and 
collectively  do indeed count, and, working 
together, can accomplish extraordinary things.
The environmental crisis exists precisely 
because of actions we have taken and policies 
we have adopted. Our species got itself into this 
mess, and we must get ourselves out of it.
April 22, 1990 will mark the beginning of long
term commitment to building an 
environmentally sound society. Will you help?
 Earth Day 1990


---------------------------------------------------

Earth Day 1970 was the largest organized demonstration in the history of the world. More than 20 million 
people participated in the event that gave birth to the modern American environmental movement. Activities 
ranged from nature walks to direct action against major polluters. The Mayor of New York banned automobiles 
from Fifth Avenue and 100,000 people attended an eco-fair in Union Square. The U.S. Congress formally 
adjourned for Earth Day to enable members to attend teach-ins in their districts. In response to the concern 
raised by Earth Day activities, the Environmental Protection Agency was created in 1971. The Clear Air Act 
and Clean Water Act soon followed.
Earth Day has developed into an international event because of the devotion of its 
members to the cause of protecting the earth from eventual human caused 
destruction. John McConnell and Margaret Mead announced in November 
1969 at a UNESCO Conference that on the next spring equinox, an Earth 
Day was to be held. According to McConnell, Earth Day's purpose was 
"to provide a truly international holiday dedicated to the care of the 
Earth." McConnell also stated that "Earth Day is to remind each 
person of his right, and the equal right of every other person, to 
the use of this global home  and the equal responsibility of 
each person to preserve and improve the Earth."
The original Earth Day proclamation was signed by 21 
individuals. "In our short-sightedness, we have failed 
to make provisions for the poor, as well as the rich, 
to inherit the earth, the proclaimation said." The 
March Equinox, the original Earth Day, was 
proclaimed by San Francisco in November 1969 
and celebrated in California the next year.
United Nations Secratary General U Thant soon 
called for the global celebration of Earth Day to 
be on the Equinox. In 1972, Thant's successor, 
Kurt Waldheim, rang the U.N. Peace Bell on 
Earth Day and a New York TV station 
scheduled 12 hours of shows concerning the 
envrionment. Earth Day has since then 
continued as a U.N. ceremony and other 
varied forms of celebration in the world.
On April 22, the 20th anniversary of the first 
Earth Day, the entire world will once again 
celebrate our planet and address issues that 
affect us as a planet. Organizations from the 
U.S., U.S.S.R., Canada, China, and Japan are 
already involved in making this event 
successful worldwide. Ordinary people, 
students, scientists, musicians, and politicians 
are all working hard to make Earth Day work 
from every conceivable angle.
Earth Day will address the same issues that fill 
the newspapers and television broadcasts: 
greenhouse gases, ozone holes, acid rain, toxic 
waste, desert expansion, depletion of tropical rain 
forests, recycling, energy use, pesticides, 
transportation, water conservation, and activism. On 
Sunday, April 22, 1990, millions of people around the 
world will join together in a massive demonstration of 
concern for these issues in our environment.
Locally, The Ecological Conservation and Humanitarian 
Organization (ECHO), in association with the Student 
Environmental Action Coalition (SEAC), preparing activities on 
campus. Volunteers are needed to help out in any way they can. Contact

Aunt Becky, who taught me to fish 
when I was ten, in her boat on the Sound, 
burnt to ashes yesterday, when Christmas candles 
tipped and the house caught fire in her sleep.
Uncle Lou was gone that night.
and the flames trapped Aunt Beky alone.
I drove to the dock when I heard, to be alone, 
but all I could remember was the fish 
that flopped in the stern, and how that night 
I lay in bed, the thumping sound 
of a dying snapper cutting my sleep.
Dreams of sun flashing on scales, like thousand candles.
Wed set the table with flowers and candles 
and then I waited in the dining room alone, 
tired and sore, but too frightened to sleep.
Afraid of being chased by bleeding fish.
From the kitchen, the skillet spitting sound
as the fish fried was warning of the death in the night.
"Adamcyk continues to breathe life into the sesiina...her most 
ambitions work to date."

"If von'rc wondering if this hook is available. Don't. It is not

Now I think of the sound of flames in the night,
and I know I wont sleep. Ill think of fishhooks and candles,
of Aunt Becky dying alone, and the bitter taste of our fish.

By Way of Introduction
I GOTTA BE ME
By Tammy Bakker
138 pp. Harrison: New Leaf Press.
$3.50 pbk.
Christopher Kush
od is not dead, after all.
Hes alive and well and living in TV Land where He not only 
has stopped speaking in parables but is allowing Himself to be 
quoted.
God is saying things like, Let your fingers do the walking 
through the yellow pages, Tammy. Thats how I want you to 
pray ... That way you wont make a mistake and blow the 
whole roof off of PTL.
Its all in Tammys autobiography, I Gotta Be Me. The book 
isnt new, so if you want a copy after reading this review, 
youre going to have to search for it. It was published in 1984 
before Tammy blew the roof off of PTL despite Gods good 
advice.
About searching for books. Last summer, I took my friend, 
Buzz, to St. Elmos Book Store on the South Side. Buzz said he 
liked book stores. This was a lie.
Buzz has a philosophical bent. Hes a thinker, an observer, a 
guy who, with all his might, attempts to order his world through 
unique paradigms.
Buzz is also a tremendous scaredy-cat. Hes the one who 
warned me of kidney failure when running, that brushing too 
long only removes the enamel from your teeth, and that odd 
masturbatory habits hinder sexual prowess.
I left him in the philosophy section, cracking books open with 
one hand as delicately as if he were spreading a butterflys 
wings. With the other hand he palmed an orange that was in his 
jacket pocket.
Buzz has a security blanket relationship with oranges. When
ever he gets frustrated or when the preliminary outlines of some 
world view pop into his head, he eats one.
After we left St. Elmos, Buzz said, God, there are so many 
books.
I asked Buzz if he wanted to go to City Books and check out 
the used book crop, but he just sat down on the sidewalk and 
pulled out the orange.
No more book stores, Buzz said. He was turning the orange 
over in his hands.
Look, Buzz,.I said, think about the millions of books that 
are out there, and then think about the less than 1 % of those 
books you are ever going to get to read. For someone like 
Buzz who.feels he must ingest all previously written knowledge 
in order to shine the light further on, a book store can be quite 
daunting. I figured if intellectual torture did not get him moving 
again, nothing would.
I think Buzz was listening. He found a crack in the skin of his 
orange and injected his thumbnail. Bombarded by mist and the 
white tendrils of vegetation, his hands began to reveal the fruit 
inside.
And the vast majority of the books you do read are not going 
to be important to youmaybe only 5% of that 1 % of untold 
millions of textual possibilities are going to make any difference 
to you. Isnt that amazing?
No answer. Ive noticed Buzz always looks disappointed after 
the orange separates under the guidance of his thumbs, as if he 
expected to find a pearl in the center.
In an information society you have to leam how to sample, 
how to find meaning somewhere between Dostoevsky and the 
McDonalds menu. You might as well resign yourself to the fact 
that you will not be able to do an exhaustive reading of any
thing. Come on. Buzz, quit being such a baby. Get up. Take it 
like a man.
Buzz finally did get up, reluctantly, after he ate the orange, 
slice by slice, until it was gone.
I hear now Buzz doesn't like librariesthey make him 
nervous. So much for my speech, but I meant every word of it. 
And furthermore, (I dont usually like to pontificate, not usu
ally) the most limiting thing you can do is restrict your sample 
to the classics. John Gardner, the no-nonsense writing guru.

says we must read deeply and widely, that means from Tammy 
Faye to Dossier to Du Maurier. The fact is, the worst has a lot 
to teach us.
Jim listens to what I say. However, when he knows he has 
heard from God, no matter what I say wont change it. I respect 
that man for that because sometimes in my little womanly way 
I want something different from what God wants, just because I 
want it.
Tammy, of course, always listens to Jim, no matter what he 
says, and to tell the truth, Jim doesnt really say anything earthshattering in I Gotta Be Me. Then again, how can he when his 
wife is quoting God?
But dont get her wrong. Tammys got balls when it comes to 
certain things. She had Gary Paxton write a forward to her 
book that said, Number 1.1 havent read it, but I know its 
great!" and still published it.
The experiences Tammy chooses to relate from her childhood 
defy explanation. Tammy must think that because everyone 
goes to the bathroom, we have a burning desire to hear stories 
about it, and it has some universal appeal to our emotions, like 
Shakespeare. The result: Tammy pulls a big 7 on the vometer.
Instead of showing her tough childhood in terms of pinching 
pennies, Tammy fixates on primitive bathroom procedures.
Apparently, they just went to the bathroom in a large pail 
upstairs.
By the way, this just gets grosser, so if youre squeamish or 
expecting, I suggest you stop right here. We have some nice 
fiction and poetry on other pages, no hard feelings.
Sometimes nobody would empty the bucket for days. Lord, 
what that woman had to endure. And once, one of her little 
brothers decided to be sweet to Mom and empty the brimming 
pail. Now, Tammy doesnt name this little fellow and you get 
the impression that there were so many little fellows around 
that she probably didnt know his name.
Just as he got over the stairway he tripped and the pailtwo 
days worthwent all down the stairs. It leaked through the 
stairs into a closet that Dad had built under the stairs and all 
over the clothes."
Its debatable whether this tale is going to set anyone on the 
path of redemption. But wait. Theres more.
As would only seem fitting, Tammy bought a dog in later life 
that also had atrocious bathroom habits. The dog was a 
Chihuahua who she named Chi Chi (divine inspiration?).
Ill ruin the whole thing right nowChi Chi dies, but there is 
a scene where Tammy asks God to raise Chi Chi from the dead 
that puts William Peter Blatty to shame and might have secured 
Tammys status as a Book of the Month Club Alternate 
Selection if only she hadnt ruined it with her potty mouth.
See, when God doesnt have Chi Chi jump up and say arf, 
Tammy gradually begins to see that Chi Chi was no prize: The 
fact was that Chi Chi was a naughty little dog. I loved him so 
much but several times I wanted to give him away because he 
wet on our drapes, especially when hes get mad at us... God 
knew that if He took him then that would be the end of the 
wetting all over her room.
Theres also the tale of the dirty dishrag: Im the type of 
person that uses my dishrag for everythingwiping up the spot 
on the floor, washing the dishes, wiping dirty little mouths,, 
whatever. Id like to hear what the owner of that dirty little 
mouth has to say about that dirty dishrag. All the emotional 
trauma that Joan Crawfords hanger failed to convey will be 
embodied in Tammys dirty dishrag as soon as her kids are old 
enough to write their own autobiographies.
The book is ghost written by a guy named Cliff Dudley, 
which is no sin in the publishing industry, but one look at the 
guy, whose picture is one the back cover, and you immediately 
suspect hes a plant. The name Dudley fits too well.
In my best Catholic attitude, Id like to say you cant judge a 
book by its cover, but the cover is what sells a book more than 
anything elsereviews, word of mouth, anything. So lets 
judge Dudley.
At the very least, Dudley looks kinda dopey. From the looks 
of his suit, you know there is a La-Z-Boy with nothing but its 
yellowing foam padding left in his living room. The only thing 
that is more unassuming than Cliff Dudley in person is Cliff 
Dudley on paper.
This may make you want to dismiss the book entirely, even if 
it did go through 8 hardback printings alone. Over 240,000 
copies sold, or so they say.
But the words National Bestseller can refer to any number 
of things. You dont have to have your title on the New York 
Times list to call your book a bestseller. If you can get Sister 
Mary Grab in Door County, Wisconsin to inflate her sales 
figures at the Lions Den Family Book Store a little, you can 
probably call your book a bestseller.
I know, its all so unfair.
Id like to be able to say we, barely in our twenties, are far 
better writers, even with our limited experience and stillmaturing minds, than Tammy and Cliffthat if Tammy 
Bakker can sell a quarter of a million copies by talking about 
pee-pee, I should be seeing some revenue from this Dossier 
thing, but I Gotta Be Me, in the end, is not a stupid book. Its a 
shrewd book written for stupid people.
When Tammy talks of Jimmy starting to preach under the 
wing of Pat Robertson, there is a careful development of Pat as 
the Father figure, the old god of television who cant quite keep 
his mission together and begs Jimmy to do a show, recruits him 
to come in and save his ministry through young blood, like a 
son. Sound familiar? And its all told with language no more 
difficult to understand and no less instructive than a parable. 
Many of the stories Tammy relates show this awareness of 
scripture.
A long time ago, Jesus disciples were getting in a funk about 
the crowds of followers not having enough to eat. According to 
one reputable source, it would have taken eight months wages 
to feed the crowd and all they had were five loaves of bread 
and two fish.
A long time after that happened, God told the wife of Jimmy 
Bakker, Tammy, there are more clothes than you need in that 
closet. You need to give them to somebody in the ministry who 
needs them.
What Jesus did was to sit everybody down in groups on the 
green grass. Then he blessed what they had to eat and gave the 
food to his disciples to set before the people.
Meanwhile, in the present, God said, Clean out another 
closet Tammy. So she cleaned out another closet. She had 
saved the clothes for years because she didnt gain weight so 
she could wear her clothes a long time.
After the disciples and the crowd had eaten and all were 
satisfied, the disciples picked up twelve baskets worth of 
broken pieces of bread and fish. Pretty good after feeding 4,000 
people, not counting women and children.
And not two days after Tammy cleaned out her third closet 
for God, a lady sent her five pieces of clothes that totaled over 
$1,000. It included the most gorgeous lavender suit with the 
skirt, the pants and a top that has a mink collar on it. She sent 
me gowns like I had never had and told me that on every show 
I would have a new outfit to wear... What a wonderful God 
we have.
Even if she sounds as dumb as a bag of rocks, Tammy knows 
what she is doing. In terms of analyzing your audience, I Gotta 
Be Me is about as successful as you can get, not nearly so 
shabby an effort as its grammar would indicate. Tammy 
Bakker, or Cliff Dudley, or whoever wrote the book, really can 
teach us something. 45 years in the slammer would be a modest 
price to pay for such knowledge. Di

Fresh Man Moves
An excerpt from
THE CINDERELLA COMPLEX
By Sara Josie Flynn 
200 pp. New York: Simon & Shoester. 
$19.95.
"Illell, Im a little worried. Shes been in bed 
for two days straight. I was lying on the dusty floor 
staring at some unusually large balls of lint. By 
squinting, with my chin on the floor, I could imagine 
myself in the Chiwawa desert, surrounded by tumble
weed. I whispered into the telephone, lying as close to 
the floor as possible, because I didnt want my 
roommate to hear me talking about her.
No. I dont think shes sick. Because shes not 
alone. They havent gotten out of bed for days. Well, I 
dont know who he is. He hasnt exactly introduced 
himself. It was my thirteenth day of my freshman 
year at Carnegie Mellon. I didnt know anybody 
except for my roommate. I cant tell where hes from. 
Hes not wearing any distinguishable clues. Actually, 
he isnt even wearing as much as a watch. There were 
some boxer shorts on the floor, but I couldnt see the 
label.
Before I had left for college, my sister, Coco, and I 
had spent hours discussing the probability that my 
roommate would be pretty and fun. We had hoped she
would be popular, but now I wished she werent quite 
so popular. The girl had been socializing, in one form 
or another, twenty-four hours a day.
When school first started, I would go back to our 
room and find one or two of Pollys suitors perched 
on her bed. I had complained to my sister that being 
alone with two at once was awkward. I should have 
been thankful. Her new found monogamy, which 
Coco and I had hoped for, made me much more 
uncomfortable. I whispered in the dust to my sister. 
Yesterday, I got dressed in the hallway. The janitor 
who was vacuuming said Good morning, Sara. He 
knows me. Honestly, Im surprised he didnt compli
ment me on the towel I was wearing. By next week, 
hell probably be saying, Sara, dont you think your 
red sweater would be better with that?
Coco tried to pacify me by insisting that difficult 
decisions, especially in regard to getting dressed, are 
often made more easily with help from others. This 
did not help to ease my mind.
I dont know what to do. I guess Ill just wait and 
see what happens with them. I had spent the first few 
weeks of college silently convinced that I was a total 
misanthrope. Everything I had done seemed foreign to 
the college community in Pittsburgh. Just to begin 
with, my roommate had been horrified that I had 
attended Friends Seminary, a Quaker school, all my 
life.
Do you have to do a lot of.. ah.. Quaker things? 
she had asked, using the same tone one does when 
one approaches people who have incurable diseases.
Her eyebrows had knitted together in concern, and I 
thought she was going to wring her hands or flail her 
arms at any minute.
No, I said, making a note to describe my school in 
the future as simply private and my place of residence 
as New York. If pressed for details, I would admit 
New York City. I did not improve matters by taking 
most of my phone calls in the coat closet, where I 
suffocated, whispering for hours, but by the second 
week of school, I didnt care. 1 was more worried 
about the fact that I was now living with Polly and 
Chris, her ever present boyfriend.
Well, anyway, they cant possibly stay in bed 
forever, Coco and I agreed, enthusiastically. How 
wrong we were. Not only were they in bed almost 
every time I walked into the room, they were also 
very noisy whenever the lights were out. After three 
more weeks of their dating, I was exhausted, and they 
werent. I finally nabbed Polly one day on her way 
from the bathroom to the bedroom.
Polly, I said, as if I hadnt been loitering in the 
hall, waiting to get the courage to knock on our door. 
I just want to talk to you for a minute.
I could see her eyes glaze over with boredom. She 
patted her blonde hair. Rather a useless gesture, I 
thought, since she was obviously going back to bed. 
None-the-less, I wanted to look relaxed, and progres
sively hip. I leaned against the wall. I thought this 
would appear casual, as one college roommate does, 
talking with another.
As you know, I am going to the Delta Kappa

SOUTHSIDE STORIES
By Mark Schmick 
133 pp. Chicago: Peddler's Press. $18.95.
H ello, Tilly.
Claires cat stood politely in the bedroom doorway, 
her eyes large and curious. She was a tan-dappled Per
sian, and at the sound of my voice, she began walking 
towards me with utter quiet, her thick fur muffling 
even the tiny bell on her collar. She began sniffing 
carefully at my toes as I jotted down a few last lines in 
my journal.
I was sitting on the floor in Erics spare bedroom, in 
the light of a lamp made from an old brass fire 
extinguisher. He and Claire were already asleep in the 
bedroom across the hall. Not me, though. For the last 
week my anticipation had been growing, mushroom
ing, until it was of such a size now that no room was 
left for fatigue. Tilly was oblivious in her feline way; 
she walked calmly up my left leg and took a seat in 
my lap, eyes closed, rumbling deeply as I scratched 
between her shoulder blades. Lucky cat. She had not 
spent each of her spare moments over the last two
months thinking about this trip. She hadnt gone 
through pains to clear her schedule. I picked her up 
and dumped her gently on the floorshe didnt need 
to get up at five the next morning, either. I had to at 
least try for some sleep. I climbed into the bed and 
pulled the comforter up. I sank my head into the down 
pillow, into another reverie about this storytelling 
festival. My thoughts wandered down paths and 
corridors, passing people and forecasts, hoping to find 
around some comer the other end of this endless night.
At five-ten, Eric shook me out of a deep sleep; 
Time to change beds, Captain! My mind was thick 
with tom dreams and sleepI gave a long groan. I 
moved as if I was in water. I zipped up my duffel bag 
and headed downstairs, out the back door. Erics 
Mercedes was chugging quietly in the driveway, a 
plume of smoke and steam rising from its tail pipe in 
the chill morning. I threw my bag in the trunk and 
climbed into the back seat. In the plush depths of the 
sheepskin covers, I found sleep again immediately. 
Dimly, there were noises. Vibrations and forces.
Doors slamming. I was pushed around like luggage 
and then there was something warm beside me. I 
awoke three hours later to find that the warm thing 
was my friend Mike.
We had picked him up before leaving Pittsburgh. 
Mike had introduced me to Eric that summer when we 
were rooming together. He wore wonderful berets and 
our discussions had proven him politically correct. Id
grown to like him a lot, but I hadnt gotten to know 
Claire very well. I knew that she was an electrician, as 
Eric was. From my vantage point in the back seat I 
studied her as we rolled along. I noticed for the first 
time how attractive she was, her face a petite box of 
sharp features, with large clear eyes. I enjoyed the 
sense of energy I saw in the nods of her head and the 
vehemence of her speaking. I wondered what she 
thought of me. Did I strike her as intelligent? Witty? 
Sexy? I looked over at Eric. We would fight over her. 
We would fight savagely, like animals. He was larger 
than me, howeverperhaps a club of some kind....
I stopped myself and shook my head, tossing the 
thoughts out like dice. Why always this? It happened 
constantly: nobler thoughts funneling into a cesspool 
of mere meddling. There ought to be some way to 
censor, to maintainI shook my head again, smiling 
at myself. Still trying to figure out thoughts...trying to 
figure out a body function like breathing, like diges
tion. I aimed my attention away from my own head 
and caught the tail end of a conversation between Eric 
and Mike: ...with what you say. What I cant stand is 
the way he goes about it; he chews up people and 
masticates them in public... They were arguing about 
the pending election next week in Pittsburgh. During 
the lulls, I could hear snatches of the tape that was 
playing, a monologue by Gamble Rogers, one of the 
storytellers from last year's festival.

is not going to break 
down patriarchal society.
1 want us to share more

the personal is personal

nobody's business except oU 
yours and mine
When 1 hold your hand
it's not meant as a show 
of strength. I don't want 
to ponder power struggles 
every time we make love; 
I'd rather close my eyes
and search the savanna 
of your lips. Let us both 
be blind.OyiHJ pRHdRyk

WingtipS You brace the pedal with a stone
as your children press clay into the creviced
pattern of your wingtips. Your hands
center a ball of clay. You work the smooth
and press your fingers evenly until the clay
opens in. Layers collect in the deep spaces behind you.
A ridge begins as a ripple
and you follow it up to the rim
where you leave it, thick as a windowpane. You return to the middle
of the vortex. The crisscrossed patterns
remind you of tortoise shells or cracked glass.
Finished, you stoke the kiln
poking tools deep in the wavering mouth.
The fired vessel glazed dark 
red. You picked your children up in your arm 
and tossed them into a pile of sawdust 
and hay which felt like your skin.
They run over with sacks of laughter
in their lungs. You find
the ridges in their bodies and gentle fingers
work odd sounds out of them; mouths open,
lips quivering at how much of you they held inside.

I move behind you and cradle your now smaller body

escape you like a forgotten thought. Your hands
grope for form and shape.
You mumble words as if your mouth
is full of water. I catch the scraps of the words,
"Clay is just organized dirt and in a way so are we. I feel

You knead it like bread, to get the air

up towards your chin as if removing a lover's shirt.
I let go and your fingers find 
grooves, you dip them in water

You finished and slumped over, tired,
I found your grooved rib cage and helped
you to your feet. We walked out through the grove,
kicked gravel leading our way. It clicked
like fine pieces of shattered clay as if that evening
the hugest container in the world had broken.
I only remember a piece of that night. I left 
you in the grove. I returned to the potters wheel 
and found the vessel Raku fired. Straw smoked 
gray into the cracks. I knew you were gone 
and stepped inside the vessel.
I wanted to fall through or else reach down and pull you out.
Waist deep in your work, I bent and tasted
the ceramic; the calloused surface, reminding me of hands
I'll soon have. The taste is of the places
where dirt first settled. I thought
I could still taste the sweat of your hands on the clay.

i'm cold, shivering

anything left

rage is there
anger comes up in my throat
my chest is tight 
energy humming inside me 
muscles twitching 
a shattered reflection 
in each piece of glass 
i can't get away
i lay on the glass
pinpricks of blood from my skin
i want to get away
everywhere i look 
hundreds of cold eyes look back 
in judgement 
with hate
scorning my lack of control

Barbara has no complaints.
She is free. Off to work
at four a.m., scrub toilets 
with Comet, and send the refuse
on its way to the sea via 
Ohio, Mississippi, Gulf
of Mexico. When unfolding 
a road map of this country
and holding it by the edges, 
the middle sags from all
the shit-water thats run off 
to the center. Everything
decays from the inside 
leaving an empty husk,
and sometimes, like bad editing 
in an old Westeren she watches
on cable, the way we look 
shows us how two-dimenlional
the scenery is. How the 9 a.m. 
crowd comes in to spill
their guts to her and coffee 
on the floor. Going home
she stops at the store; the man 
behind the counter eyes
her over, asks if he can help, 
but she wont play ball.
He doesnt look at her again.
If she gives in, she has to return
something. But not here, maybe 
someplace worse, like Detroit,
in the middle of America 
shell lose her edge.
Hell take her to all the best 
resturants, whisper sweet
nothings in her ear, and shell 
buy it. But shes not ready
yet. She walks past dirt 
mounds, future site of luxury
condos. Unlike all this, she
does not await further development.

Tornado Warning
An excerpt from
THE HAZARDS OF PLOT
By Skef Wholey
139 pp. New York: Kmopf. $18.95.
T he wind carried all the children away, it blew so 
hard. Harv and Jack and Magic Girl sat with me on the 
spiral staircase fire escape eating Chinese food and 
drinking Rolling Rock ponies, which we dropped, one 
by one as they were emptied, into the alley below. 
Sometimes there would just be a pop when one hit, 
sometimes a real Hollywood shattering glass sound, 
but the green shards piled deeper either way. Harv 
wondered how much wed have to drink before the 
pile got so deep the bottles wouldnt break anymore.
Sitting there we could see the sunset to our left and 
the rainbow to our right, and the sky-blue house at the 
end of the rainbow. Maybe thats where all the 
children went, Harv said, maybe they went to that skyblue house.
Jack just smiled and Magic Girl said, Why are you 
smiling? Dont you care about the wind? Dont you 
care about the children?
Jack said, I smile because Im afraid of dying, for the 
first time in my life. You see, if Im afraid to die, I 
must be happy. And if Im happy, I should smile.
I pushed the window open and went back into Magic 
Girls apartment. I stood there in the dark, looking 
back at them crouched on the rusty metal structure, 
profiles lit in sunset-orange. For days now, no 
electricity, no water, no cable TV. We were living on 
beer and Chinese food. The floor was dusty, littered 
with those little take-out cartons and bottle caps and 
pieces of foam leaking from the couch, the only piece 
of furniture still there.
Once the sun went down the temperature dropped 
and everyone came back into the apartment. Magic 
Girl lit five or six candles on the mantelpiece and lay 
across the couch. The rest of us sat on the floor.
Harv started going through her record collection, 
uselessly, aimlessly. Once in a while he would study 
the back of an album, squinting to read the liner notes. 
I sat against the head of the couch, and Magic Girl ran 
her fingers through my hair. I reached up, held her 
hand, kissed it softly and quietly. Jack leaned against 
the wall, fixing his serene gaze on the ceiling, on the 
flickering candlelight.
We sat that way for an hour, two hours, in silence, as 
the candles grew shorter, as the wax dripped down 
onto the mantelpiece and then onto the floor. We had 
burned that many candles, enough to cover the mantel
piece. I said, How many nights has it been?
Six, Harv said breathlessly. He was sitting very still 
now, arms crossed, looking vaguely at the floor.
Jack said, Four, I thought it was only four.
The candles danced.
Magic Girl said, Lets make it.five, then. Its been 
five nights.
None of us argued with her reasoning.
In the morning, Harv went down to get our brown 
rice breakfast from the Chinese restaurant. Jack and I 
spent four or five minutes in a half-feigned attempt to
clean up the debris scattered across the floor, using our 
feet to sweep smaller piles into larger piles and the 
larger piles into a corner. Feet being particularly 
unbroomlike, the main effect of this was that we got 
ours pretty filthy. The floor looked about the same.
Magic Girl opened the first beer of the day and used 
it to wash our eight chopsticks. Alcohol is just right 
for this, she said, itll sterilize them, prevent disease.
Jack stepped out through the window and stood on 
the fire escape. Its still there, he said. The rainbow. 
His smile was also still there, and his fear of death and 
whatever train of thought it was that connected the 
two.
Harv came in through the front door carrying two 
cartons. Im sick of eating this shit, he said. Theres no 
way we can live on this stuff, this same stuff day after 
day after day. Theres just no way.
We dont have any choice, said Magic Girl. She 
circled the room handing out chopsticks, first to me, 
then to Jack as he came inside, and finally to Harv. 
Theres no other food, she said. I have a feeling its 
going to be that way for a while.
Jack and I sat in front of the fireplace taking turns 
eating from one of the cartons Harv and Magic Girl 
did the same sitting on the couch. We were all, in fact, 
sick of the food, but we ate quickly, hungrily. Even 
Harv.
Food is food, Jack said, passing me the carton. And 
anyway its not such a bad life were living right now.
We eat, we drink, we look at the world from a fire 
escape. The children might return, and the electricity 
and the water and everything else, any minute. Or they 
might never return.
Harv closed his eyes and bent over, putting his 
forehead to his knees. His breathing became con
gested, a tear dropped from his cheek to the floor. 
Magic Girl touched his shoulders, brought his head 
onto her lap. His face was red, contorted, his nose a 
little snotty. He started breathing quietly, from his 
mouth instead of his nose, as if making a sound was 
the one thing he wouldnt let himself do. As if the 
slightest whimper would lead to a breakdown.
Magic Girl gently laid her hands on his head and 
stroked him lovingly, respecting his fragility, cherish
ing it.
Harv breathed silently, painfully, for half an hour. 
We watched him while Magic Girl held him. Jack and 
I wondered what to say or
not say. Then he got up looking for a handkerchief or 
tissue, something to blow his nose on.
And then we started on the beer.
Dinner was as it had been, the four of us sitting 
outside the window as the sun went down, drinking 
beer, dropping the bottles.
Harv wondered how much wed have to drink before 
the pile got so deep the bottles wouldnt break any
more.
The wind had made a wonderful mess of everything.

Epsilon formal. She looked at me blankly, igno
rantly, and apparently not grasping the fact that the 
DKEs were not among the fraternities at CMU.
I am going with a friend of mine from high 
school, I added, just in case she was concerned about 
whom I was dating. Judging from the blank expres
sion I received, she wasnt. I plowed on.
He goes to Kenyon College, in Gambier, Ohio. Our 
families are friends at home. I wanted to reassure her 
that he was socially acceptable, and the entire trip had 
been parentally approved. She smoothed her eye
brows, completely uninterested.
Ill be gone for the whole weekend. Polly sud
denly snapped to attention.
When are you leaving? she asked, eagerly.
Friday afternoon. I said. Polly bolted for the 
bedroom door.
Polly, just a minute. She turned around. I hated to 
do it, but I had to, I couldnt take it anymore. When I 
come back, I want Chris, and all his stuff, out.
Pollys jaw dropped. She looked at me in amazej ment. But I was prepared, I had discussed this 
problem with my RA. I knew I was well within my 
rights. Besides, I was tired of him snoring in my 
room, day and night. I was sick of dressing, eating, 
and living in the hallway.
Look, Chris has a room. I know he doesnt like his 
roommate but thats no excuse, I said firmly. I 
wanted to qualify my statement, I dont like you, and 
were living together, but I refrained. Its not that I 
dont enjoy his company, I happened to think he was 
a sloth, a slob, and inherently lazy, But theres an 
awful lot of it. It seems like more too, because we 
have such a small room. Besides, I stared at her 
directly,  I need to get some rest.
Polly seemed horrified. At that point, I think she had 
only been to two classes, so she didnt know how ex
hausting school could be. In addition to that fact, I had 
yet to see her so much as open one of the dusty books 
on her desk.
Okay, Ill tell him. Polly looked at me mourn
fully, slowly turning the doorknob of our room. I felt 
like Juliets mother, forbidding Romeos attentions. I 
pictured her sitting on her bed, gently shaking Chris 
awake, and telling him the romance was over. No 
more popping popcorn together in the wee hours of 
the morning. No more loud crunching, or hysterical 
giggling for hours at a time. The era of days and 
nights of romance in 3C6 had ended. On one hand, I 
didnt care anymore. It was my room too, and I felt 
like I had lost all my rights to use it. But on the other 
hand, who was I to stand in the way of pure innocent 
young love? It seemed that there were so few times 
when two people gravitated towards each other so 
peacefully. Guilt washed over me.
That weekend, when I was nestled in Kenyons ivy 
clad campus, bejeweled with bright autumn leaves, I 
felt differently. Friday night was clear and cold. The 
sky was drenched with stars, and Philip and I walked 
underneath them into the party. Faces of my old 
friends looked around and smiled. I raced to join the 
familiar congregation of buzzing black velvet dresses 
in elation. Everything was perfect to me.
Coming back to Pittsburgh I felt refreshed and pure, 
like a pilgrim. I happily opened the door to my room, 
struggling with my suitcase and the bag of fragrant 
apples that we had picked. All was quiet. I looked at 
Pollys bed. Not only were neither of them there, but 
her bed was also made. I put an apple on her pillow 
and happily began to unpack.
I could hear sobbing even before Polly opened the 
door. She collapsed dramatically on her bed, and fixed 
me with a cruel watery stare.
Chris ... Chris ... she choked.
Here it comes, I thought. But I was going to be firm. 
Sorry honey, hes not setting one foot in this door. 
Nope, no way, nothing doing. I steeled my nerves. I 
would not be betrayed by the compassion that made 
my eyes fill with tears from just opening Anna 
Karenina. But this was not a story of tragic romance. 
It was one of human torture. Theirs were not crossed 
paths, it was just a matter of the restraints of univer
sity housing. They simply couldnt spend all day, in 
bed, in a room the two of us were supposed to share. 
It was hard for me to keep this in mind, staring at 
Pollys teary face.
I... Chris ... she sputtered, Chris thinks you 
hate him. He was so upset. He ... he ... She was
But this was not a story of 
tragic romance. 
It was one of human torture.
practically heaving sobs, but I told myself I was not 
going to weaken. He tried to commit suicide. They 
took him to the hospital...
Oh my God, I thought. Shes serious. I had abso
lutely never felt worse. Suicide. He adored her. The 
passion was too much to bear, and it drove him over 
the edge. It wrenched my heart. Please dont let him 
die, I prayed.
I should have guessed he was mentally unbalanced. 
Every time I had seen him he was lying naked, in bed, 
sleeping, Now, I knew that wasnt normal. I should 
have guessed he wasnt actually a lazy sloth, he was 
just tragically in love. He could no longer lead a 
normal life. Oh God, what had I done?
Polly was sobbing freely now. He tried to drink a 
tube of air... air... air... plane glue.
I sank against my desk. Thank God he was stupid, 
and made his attempt with glue. His idiot nature saved 
him. I patted the part of Polly that was closest, her 
ankle, in an effort to comfort her.
Is there anything I can do?
No. Her face was muffled in her pillow. Id just 
like to be alone. Well, of course she would. The poor 
thing, I thought. So in love. The fear of losing him 
must have been horrible. I pulled my comforter from 
my bed and grabbed a pillow.
Ill just sleep on Emilys floor tonight, I whis
pered to her prone form. Its no trouble at all. I took 
my toothbrush out of my suitcase. I didnt really have 
to finish unpacking tonight, I thought, pulling the door 
quietly behind me.
I slowly exhaled. Please, please, I prayed to God, 
Dont ever let me fall in love. Love and death are 
forming a mighty spoke of the fence of life, and there 
seem to be few ways to avoid being impaled.
The next morning, when I opened that same door to 
get my things for school, I was not surprised to see 
clothes strewn about, and two naked bodies on Pollys 
bed. But as I examined the debris from their evening, 
it did seem odd that a person whose stomach was 
recently pumped, would drink several beers and eat 
several slices of pepperoni pizza from Dominos.
Then again, I thought, there are all kinds of fools.

Nest of the Killdeer
In our motel room just outside of Jonesborough I 
picked up a brochure for the festival and then got 
unpacked. It said that Tennessee has the oldest history 
of story-telling in the union. It said Jonesborough is the 
oldest city in Tennessee. Yet I didnt predict the scope 
of the thing. As we rolled up the main street I looked 
out at surprising masses of people. I had expected a few 
hundred, but the crowds around us now were milling in 
the thousands and overrunning the little town. I saw 
circus tents looming over lots as long as football fields, 
and I had to shift gears from my image of intimate 
gatherings in little tents you put up at campgrounds.
This was bigger.
"Sometimes it's the little things that are most impor
tant . When I was growing up in Austin, Minnesota, 
farms were small and there were a lot of them. We used 
plows, and soon little fifty-horsepower tractors. But the 
smart folks looked at those tractors and thought: If we 
put a larger engine in there we can plow a bigger field 
in the same amount of time. And so the tractors began 
to get bigger. Some folks realized quick that with a 
bigger engine they could tend more land in a day, so 
they scrambled to buy up the neighboring farmland. My 
family was one of those lucky ones. Other folks weren't 
so quick, they werent so lucky...
Eric was elected Daddy. He went into the registration 
cabin and registered the six of us under the family plan. 
We kids crouched on the stoop outside, in the shadow 
of a molting elm. We talked like adults about the guilt 
and the wrong of it, with much nodding, as if a little 
honest talk would pardon us. But soon Eric returned and 
our misgivings evaporated as we pinned on the calico 
patches which branded us as festival-goers. Other 
people with patches now nodded to us and smiled. We 
forgave ourselves. We had entered the Festival. It was 
time to grab our buckets, check our maps, and let the 
Festival enter us.
But our farm grew. We went from a one hundred 
horsepower tractor to a two hundred. When we added 
the Milton's pasture to our South end, we upped it 
again to three hundred. Pretty soon, the boys at the 
conventions were talking about a new string of tractors 
coming out with engines of four hundred horsepower! It 
didnt seem nearly possible, but pretty soon we were 
seeing them, and they were monstrous. That was all 
when I was still a young man"
I sat there spellbound in my seat in the Railroad Tent, 
regressed in juvenile fascination. We were in the middle 
of the Olio, a section of the Festival where the artists 
make quick introductory presentations. On stage, a 
young David Holt was breathing deeply and frantically 
into a harmonica. His face heaved and his hands were 
desperate on the instrument, as if he were trying to fit 
the thing whole into his mouth. He was in the throes of 
a miracle, playing a piece called A Race Between the 
Train, the Dog, and the Model-T. You could hear all 
three of them coming out of that harmonica, impossibly, 
remarkably, shaking my faith in human inability. At 
that point I could feel my wonder crack and I became 
almost angry in a childish way. I wanted to do what 
David Holt could do. I wanted to play the harmonica 
like a demon or make people laugh and laugh. I 
wondered how long it had taken him to leam.
After David Holt, Fred and Martha Quimby took the 
stage, singing slave songs and swapping histories of the 
South Sea Islands. At one point Fred sat down, adjusted 
the mike, and slapped out a fast hambone: Hambone! 
Hambone! Where you been? slappity-slap-slap, slapslap. All around the world and back again! slappityslap-slap, slap-slap.
We listened long and as hard. By the time the Olio 
was over we were famished . We headed over to the 
swapping grounds where a gazebo was set upwith a 
circle of trailers around it selling food. As we stood in 
line Eric grabbed Eds camera and renewed his fame 
as the Great Protruder: every year he discovered a new 
family of implements to hang out of the fly of his 
pants in public. Past years had seen the dangling of 
carrots, bananas, zoom lenses, turkey basters, as Eric 
stood proudly, hands on hips. How beautiful marriage 
seemed to me at that moment as I watched Claire 
holding the zoom lens and laughing. At the front of 
the line at last I bought a Styrofoam bowl of Mulligan 
stew from the bland-faced girl behind the screen. I 
dipped out spoonfuls of onions and carrots and 
potatoes, chewing them slowly. Good earthy vege
tables. Good earthy stories.
"Nowadays, I trot around the fields under five 
hundred horsepower, dragging a plowing disk behind 
me which stretches out over twenty feet on either side. 
One day last year I was heading around the perimeter 
of my field, with that big disc carving up the earth and 
that big engine roaring like thunder. Somehowit was 
real luckyI saw a movement out of the corner of my 
eye. I slowed up a bit and I could see that it was a 
little killdeer flapping around on the ground. Now the 
killdeer is a very special bird, in case you didnt know. 
She defends herself and her babies by play-acting; 
when she sees a predator, shell cry and flap about on 
the ground like a wing or a leg is busted. The fox or 
whatever will be so interested in her that they wont 
think about rooting out the nest. So when I saw this 
killdeer flapping around, I knew that she had her nest 
nearby, and that I was getting close to it.
Our ranks swelled to seven that night when our 
group adopted a new member, Carol from Philadel
phia. Mike had introduced himself to her at the 
swapping grounds and the two of them had struck up a 
conversation. It was good to see Mike meet someone.
I figured he needed to meet someone, someone to 
calm him down. Ever since Id met him he seemed 
nervous. No matter how much noise I made when I 
approached I always seemed to startle him. Maybe this 
was just the thing.
After the last Friday reading, the seven of us man
aged to pack into the Mercedes for a trip into the 
neighboring Johnstown. After cruising the local yahoo 
dives we finally pulled into parking lot of The 
Ruptured Duck. In the rear of the bar Ed and I found a 
gaming machine filled with stuffed animals and plastic 
eggs with shiny metal lighters in them. It was here that 
our relationship was cemented through a shared loss of 
money: The object of the game was to maneuver a 
claw so that it dropped and grabbed one of the prizes, 
then carried it over to a delivery chute. While the rest 
of the group got slowly and solidly drunk, Ed and I 
spent around fifteen dollars fruitlessly derricking for a 
two dollar teddy bear. My motivation followed a 
typical gamblers curve. I was soon blind to the 
cuteness of the bearI just wanted to grab it in both 
hands and pull off its head with my teeth.
Back at the motel, I sat on my bed and carefully 
scheduled the storytellers that I wanted to see on 
Saturday. Robin Williams, certainly, and Rosalie 
Sorrels. Ed and Beverley had seen Rex Ells and rec
ommended him strongly. It looked like the day was 
going to end up with Michael Cotter, the farmer from 
Austin, Minnesota. I hadnt seen him yet but Carol 
had, last year. She told me, quite forcefully, that he. 
was necessary.
When I first saw her she was acting like one of her
wings had gone lame. But after about ten more feet 
she started to get more frantic. She started limping 
and flapping as though one her legs was busted, too.
In another ten feet, it was like shed gone berserk; her 
whole body was shaking and flapping and crippling, 
and she started to give out this real pitiful squeal. I 
could hear it even above the tractor so I knew I was 
close. Sure enough, after a few more feet this little 
mother bird flies right up onto the hood of my tractor 
and sets up such a squealing and flapping...Well, Id 
never seen anything so desperate, and her being no 
bigger than one of the lug nuts on my rear wheel...
I had been carrying a large soap bucket with me 
during the festival. It swung at my side as I went from 
tent to tent. If the seats were all taken, as they often 
were, I could just sit the bucket down near the front 
and then sit on the bucket. Instant seat. Other people 
kept saying it was a good idea, but I didnt see any 
other buckets. At Michael Cotters reading, though, I 
didnt need my trusty little bucket. An accidental ma
neuver landed me in the front row of chairs, next to a 
pair of old women who were arguing over some kind 
of money problem. There was about twenty minutes 
wait until the start of the reading, and the womens 
conversation was nothing to eavesdrop on, a complaint 
exchange, so I put my feet up and began laying down 
a few more lines in my journal. In front of me, and a 
little to the right, a boy opened up a little folding chair 
and sat down. He looked about six. He was delighted 
at being in the front and chirped to his mother about 
how delighted he was. He had a friend with him and 
the little boy chirped at him, too. I noticed that the 
friend didnt chirp back. He was busy looking around 
the tent for a place to sit. He looked about six also, a 
little pudgier than his friend and not so happy. I 
looked at him a few moments and then took my feet 
off the bucket and dusted off the dirt from my shoes. I 
slid it forward, next to his friends chair, and tapped 
twice.
The pudgy boy looked down at the bucket and then 
up at me as if I were the Messiah. He had a country 
face and those childrens eyes that are large and clear 
like pools of mountain water. Go ahead, before 
someone else gets it. He nodded vigorously and sat 
down, socking his friend in the arm with a wondrous 
gusto. I continued writing for a few more minutes, a 
few more lines. When the roadies hopped up on stage 
to adjust the mikes I returned my pen and journal to 
my book bag. I leaned back in my chair and relaxed, 
smelling the earth as it breathed up between the chairs 
in the tent. In the back of my mind, I wondered lazily 
what this Cotter fellow would be speaking about. Id 
heard he was a farmer.
"I braked the tractor right then, and cut the motor. 
As soon as I did, the most amazing silence poured 
over me. I looked out over the fields arid they were just 
so quiet and peaceful. I looked down at the killdeer 
and she was standing there upright, looking back at 
me. Youre gonna have to trust me,' 1 told her. 'Youre 
gonna have to show me that nest.' And it was like she 
knew just what I said, because she flew down from the 
hood and squatted on the ground not ten feet away. 
Then I could see it. She looked up at me as I started 
the tractor. I raised that big disc up on its hydraulics 
and passed over that nest. I gave it plenty of room to 
clear and then I lowered it back down and continued 
plowing. As I finished up the field I thought a lot about 
that little bird. I thought about how shed stood up to 
fight what threatened her, no matter what, and I 
wished that I knew more people like that. And thats 
the end of my story.
