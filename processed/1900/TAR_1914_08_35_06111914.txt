Faculty to be pensioned by Carnegie 
'Foundation on retirement. Two mil
lion dollars have been added to the 
endowment fund of the Carnegie Institue, including the Institute proper 
and the technical schools, by their 
founder, Andrew Carnegie, according 
to an announcement made by Col. 
Samuel Harden Church on Thursday, 
June 4.
The two million dollars is to be di
vided equally between the library, mu
seum and The Carnegie Institute of 
Technology. This makes the total 
gifts of Mr. Carnegie to these institu
tions $24,000,000. As a result of the 
latest gift, the budget of the institute 
will be enlarged $100,000 per year.
The director and faculty of these 
schools, the director of the museum 
and the Department of Fine Arts and 
such of the curators in their depart
ments as are engaged in teaching will 
be granted pension allowances upon 
retirement by the Carnegie Founda
tion for the Advancement of Teach
ing, upon the same terms as instruc
tors in other institutions of learning 
which the Foundation has already ap
proved. This is recognition of the fine 
work done by these departments, and 
will undoubtedly make these positions 
more desirable in the future.
The following report from the Ap
propriations Committee was adopted: 
Department of Fine Arts, $68,000; an 
increase of $2,000; Museum, $73,000, 
an increase of $7,000; maintenance and 
operation of main building, Carnegie 
Institute and Library, $63,278, an in
crease of $1,278; training school of 
librarians, $7,500, an increase of $2,- 
500; pension fund for superannuated 
employees, $10,000; Carnegie Insti
tute of Technology, $400,500, an in
crease of $67,500; contingent fund, 
$30,672, an increase of $19,672; total 
appropriation, $652,950, being an in
crease of $50,000.
The following committee was ap
pointed by President Church, for the 
ensuing three years to care for in
terests of the Carnegie Institute of 
Technology, the new members being 
indicated by a star: William McConway, chairman; John A. Brashear, R. 
A. Franks, W. L. Scaife, Joseph G.

o a New Type o (lass Day
The Class Day Committee, com
posed of sixteen students and four as
sisting members from the Faculty, 
have practically completed all the 
numerous details for next Monday, 
and are to be congratulated on the 
program they have arranged. This 
year a Class Day for the entire In
stitute of Technology will replace 
separate exercises by each of the four 
schools.
Dancing Dolls, a short, humorous, 
one-act play, will be the first event. It 
will be produced by the students of 
the Department of Dramatic Arts on 
Flagstaff Hill at four oclock.
After this fantastic comedy, the 
Class Day guests will go to the Camp
us, where the Choral Club will sing 
from the Band-stand at five oclock. 
Scattered over the lawns between the 
Industries and Science buildings will 
be standards decorated with Japanese 
lanterns, and surrounded by benches. 
Seats will be provided for several 
thousand persons.
From 5:30 to 7:30 Nirellas Band of 
twenty pieces will give a concert, dur
ing which time the spreads will take 
place.
The Theta Xi Fraternity will spread 
in the Computing Laboratory in Ma
chinery Hall; the Delta Delta Soror
ity and the Alpha Psi of the M. M. 
C. S., will spread in Room 201 of the 
Design building; the Alpha Delta of 
M. M. C. S., in Room 224 of the In
dustries building; the Ohpeleum in 
Room 122 of the Industries building; 
and the Theta Sigma of the M. M. 
C. S., in the Science building. In ad
dition to the above several groups of 
students will entertain guests in their 
own fraternity or club house near the 
Institute. The Faculty Club will open 
its rooms in Machinery Hall to all 
members of the Faculty on Class Day 
afternoon.
A refreshment booth, with ice 
cream, cool drinks, sandwiches, etc., 
will be available for those who do not 
attend the spreads. It will be lo
cated, with tables, on the lawn at the 
upper end of the Industries building. 
By means of this arrangement, and 
the spreads it will be possible for 
one to remain on the grounds until 
the evening performances.
At 7:45 the seniors of the Margar
et Morrison Carnegie School will pre
sent Miltons Comus on Flagstaff 
Hill, assisted by several students from 
the Department of Music. Acetylene 
lights will furnish the illumination. 
The play is under the direction of 
Miss Demerest of the Faculty, Miss 
Stoner being the coach for the dances.
The final events, from 9:15 to 10:00, 
will be Old-Time Campaign Scenes by 
the Students of the Industries School. 
A fife and drum corps, oil-cloth capes, 
torches, leggins, and white duck trous
ers, illuminated signs, and a stump 
oration will all figure in this closing 
number of the days program.
Seniors can secure, without ex
pense, in Room 117 of the Industries 
building, as many class day tickets for 
friends as they can use, and every un
dergraduate will receive three. M. M. 
C. S. students can secure theirs at the 
Deans office.

ing a place in the line after the Fac
ulty, Alumni and graduating classes. 
Seats will be reserved in the Music 
Hall for the Junior, Sophomore and 
Plebe classes.
Tuesday, June 2: Perfect baseball
weather failed to urge our baseball 
fans to the Allegheny game on the 
home field. Symptoms of spring 
fever were very noticeably among the 
players, but Brine produced a mo
ments stir in the grandstand by mak
ing a double play.
The scoring began in the second 
inning. E. Gilbert and Mellon, batting 
for Allegheny, were easy outs. Brookmire then lined out a double to right 
field and scored on Shenefelts single 
to center. Tech tallied two runs in 
her half of the second. Lain was put 
out at first by Campman. Humphries 
then singled to left and crossed the 
plate on Krumms long drive to center. 
McDonald struck out. Ryan singled 
and Krumm scored.
The third inning was uneventful. 
In the fourth Gilbert doubled to left. 
Mellon popped to Humphries. Brookmire singled, sending in Gilbert, and 
scored after both Shenefelt and Craig 
had safely hit. Allegheny had a batt
ing rally in the fifth. Three men 
doubled and netted two more runs. 
This ended the visitors scoring.
Carnegie tied the score in the fifth 
when Brookmire was found for three 
hits and walked two men. Three more 
runs were scored in the seventh 
which won the game for Tech.

THE SENIORS.
For many students next Tuesday 
marks the completion of a happy four 
years at Carnegie. We must all re
gret somewhat that these days will 
soon be past, but if we have used our 
time wisely, we cannot help but feel 
a certain satisfaction mingled with the 
regret.
What have we gotten during these 
years? Why did we come to Carnegie 
originally? Was it for mere booklearning, or did we feel that here was 
an opportunity for acquiring an inti
mate knowledge of our fellow men? 
The answer depends upon the indi
vidual. Most of us, it is to be hoped, 
have learned a little from both sourc
es. Mental training by itself is value
less, unless it broadens the mind so 
as to give a new and broader concep
tion of life. Unless we have begun 
to realize that mans chief end is serv
ice to his fellow man, the four years 
spent here have been wasted. If we 
have prepared for a broader and bet
ter existence, well and good; but if 
we have become narrow or over-de
veloped in any one direction, the 
course has been a failure.
In one sense an end, in another 
Commencement is truly a beginning. 
Up to this time we have been prepar
ing. Now we go out to test our prep
aration. Probably few of us will ever 
use more than a small portion of what 
we have learned from books. With
out any doubt, we shall find that we 
have learned here is but a negligible 
part of that which we shall have to 
learn from the experience of the 
world. So let us not presume on the 
thoroughness of our knowledge. We 
have acquired merely the rudiments; 
the rest must come to each man by 
his own individual efforts.
One thing, let us resolve, namely, 
that we are going to be useful citi
zens of our country. In these days 
of corrupt politics, there is a great 
need for honest, vigorous men who 
will feel themselves responsible for 
the conditions of their fellow men, 
and who, knowing their responsibility, 
will have the courage to bring about 
reforms. Surely such men are to be 
found among the graduates of Ameri
can colleges, and it is to be hoped 
that many of Carnegies graduates 
will find their greatest ambition in 
this unselfish service to mankind.
Our school has great things in store 
for it. As Alumni, let us endeavor to 
further this growth, stimulating all 
matters touching school spirit, plac
ing before the various preparatory 
schools of the country the advantages 
of Carnegie as an educational institu
tion, keeping in close touch with all 
undergraduate activities, and urging 
reforms whenever they become neces
sary.
Above all else, let us esteem truth. 
We must be honest with others; we 
must be honest with ourselves.
In acquiring an education here, we 
have assumed an enormous obligation 
of love to our Alma Mater, and only 
by honest, square living can we ever 
hope to pay this debt.
C. E. G.
RECEPTION OF PLEBES.
In the opinion of the 1915 Science 
class, the time has come for a change 
in the manner of the reception of the 
Plebes when they first enter school. 
The manouvers through which they 
have been put in the past, have been 
foolish and childish and in no way 
have they done any good for those 
hazed. On the other hand, the stu
dents thus ushered in, become dis
gusted with the treatment they re
ceive and determined to follow as few 
of the school customs as is possible 
with impunity. Rather than arousing 
in the freshmen a spirit of loyalty, 
hazing produces in them a spirit of 
antagonism to the school in general 
and to the sophomores in particular. 
Whereas, if they were greeted in a 
cial notice of their obligation to act 
gentlemanly manner and given offiin accordance with college traditions, 
the new-comers would immediately 
acquire a feeling of friendship for their 
classmates and for their future Alma 
Mater. The opening days of a stu
dents life at college are perhaps the 
most trying ones in his entire four 
years course. Hence it should be 
the desire of every upper classman to 
help the plebe by giving him the bene
fit of an experience which will aid 
him to weather this first crisis suc
cessfully. And contrary to the an
ticipated argument of the opposition, 
the other men in thus performing 
their duty, would receive from no 
sensible person the title of molly
coddle.
Acting upon the suggestion of Dean 
Leete, the incoming senior class of 
the Science School has decided to 
abolish the former methods of haz
ing their plebes. To this end a com
mittee has been appointed which will 
work out another plan for welcoming
the new students next fall. The com
mittee has not yet had time to take 
any definite action so that only the 
most important proposed changes 
may be mentioned. The previous 
practice of hazing, as just stated, will 
be entirely eliminated as far as the 
science plebes are concerned. In
stead of expecting the first year men 
to obey rules with which they are 
unacquainted, pamphlets containing 
information regarding Carnegie cus
tom's, the decorum of the plebes, and 
other valuable hints, will be distribu
ted to them. An innovation in the 
adoption of the Wisconsin system of 
senior advisorship will probably be in
stituted. The plebe class will be aportion among the seniors each of whom 
will become the advisors of those as
signed to him.
Here are the mere outlines of a 
new system of receiving the plebes, 
one which is altogether in keeping 
with the advance made by the institu
tion in other phases of its activity. 
We will not be the first to abolish 
hazing, for in many of the large uni
versities of the country it has been 
or is being prohibited. The Tartan 
heartily concurs with the attitude of 
the 1915 Science Class and entertains 
the hope that the other schools will 
follow its example and co-operate 
with it.
THE LAST ISSUE.
It is with something akin to regret 
that we publish this, the last issue of 
The Tartan for the present year, for 
we know that next year many of our 
readers will have left school.
At this time it is fitting that we ex
press our gratitude to all the loyal 
supporters of the paper both in the 
student body and in the Faculty. No 
school publication can be a success 
without the approval and backing of 
a majority of the students. Many 
times during the past year we have 
been encouraged and strengthened by 
the conviction that we were receiving 
that support. Whatever we have been 
able to accomplish,and it has been 
little enoughwould have been im
possible without the sentiment of the 
students behind us.
Then, too, we must thank many of 
the members of the faculty for their 
kindly interest and helpful sugges
tions. The wider experience of these 
men, who in their own various col
leges and universities have seen the 
success and failures of other college 
papers, has been of invaluable assist
ance to us.
We believe sincerely in a future 
growth and development for this pa
per. We want every man in school 
to share this belief with us. We hope 
soon to number among our subscrib
ers every student in the Institute. 
When that time comes, great things 
will have been accomplished both for 
the students and the paper. In the 
meanwhile, let us together, look for
ward to a greater Institute, a larger 
student body, a better school paper, 
a higher type of school spirit, and a 
nobler love for our Alma Mater.

ELECTION OF OFFICERS.
A rousing meeting of the Assembly 
of the School of Applied Industries, 
on Wednesday, June 3rd, signalized 
the closing session of that body for 
the school year. Such a display of 
spirit, in singing and cheering was 
never before witnessed in the School 
of Applied Industries. The mere men
tion of the name of a student or mem
ber of the faculty, who had done 
something for the glory of the 
Schools, brought forth an ovation. Of 
special interest was the first election 
of officers under the new Constitu
tion.
C. R. Austin, chairman of the com
mittee on nominations, reported the 
following names as the chosen candi
dates for office: D. P. Murphy and
F. J. Weigle, President; S. E. Fry 
and C. C. Coulter for Vice President; 
C. F. Peters and J. A. Currey for Sec
retary, and J R. Vernon and R. K. 
Merker for Treasurer. Printed bal
lots had been prepared and the elec
tion resulted as follows:
PresidentD. P. Murphy, 15.
Vice PresidentS. E. Fry, 15.
SecretaryC. F. Peters, 16.
TreasurerJ. R. Vernon, 16.
Speeches were made by the past 
President, J. R. Price, and the various 
members of the upper class. Votes 
of thanks were accorded Dean Connelley, Mr. McDowell, A. H. Schtz, 
and others who had helped to make 
the Assembly a success.
THE RIGHTS OF OTHERS.
From the Cleveland Plain Dealer.
Many of the discomforts of life are 
due to thoughtlessness. And the 
more thickly people are crowded to
gether the more dependent indivi
duals become on each others reason
ableness for peace and comfort.
Men or women who march down a 
crowded sidewalk three abreast dis
commode scores of pedestrains whose 
rights to protection are indentical 
with their own.
One who edges along a walk on the 
left side, diverting the entire current 
moving in the opposite direction, de
serves to be taken by the ear and led 
to the place he belongs.
A group that stops for social chat 
in the middle of a down-town side
walk shows no consideration for the 
rights of others; it constitutes a pub
lic nuisance that should be suppress
ed.
Another common bit of thoughtless
ness is shown when people gather at 
a cross-walk, completely blocking pas
sage except to those who are willing 
to skirt the crowd by going into the 
street.
These actions are not so frankly 
brutal as elbowing ones way aboard 
a street car or pushing the weak out 
of line at a tax-paying window, but 
the result is much the same; they 
are inspired by carelessness of the 
privileges of others. Possibly we 
have traffic regulations which cover 
some of these points. Consideration 
for others rights, however, is an ele
ment of character which does not 
lend itself readily to compulsion.
MORE CARNEGIE BENEFITS.
Andrew Carnegies gift of $2,000,000, 
equally divided between the Institute 
and the Schools of Technology, brings 
his foundation gifts and endowments 
of the two intimately related institu
tions to the magnificent sum of $24,- 
000,000, a larger amount than ever has 
been given for a similar purpose by 
anyone in the history of the world. 
The new endowments being in the 
usual form of 5 per cent bonds will 
give the Institute and the Schools of 
Technology an added income of $50,- 
000 each, which, needless to say, will 
enable them to greatly increase the 
scope of their work and enlarge their 
possibility for usefulness. Hardly less 
important to the same end is the addi
tional provision made by Mr. Car
negie for extension of the pension 
system of the Carnegie Foundation 
for Advancement of Teaching to the 
director and faculty of the schools 
and to the directors of the museum 
and department of fine arts of the in
stitute and such of their curators as 
do teaching work. With no need to 
concern themselves for the future the 
educators so benefited can concen
trate the full energies of their minds 
on the work in which they are en
gaged. We imagine that these latest 
gifts have rounded out and completed 
Mr. Carnegies plans for the local in
stitutions which have been his gift to 
Pittsburgh. We wish that we might 
be able to drop in with him 50 years 
hence to see how it all has worked 
out.  Taken from the Pittsburgh 
Chronicle Telegraph, June 5, 1914.
A ROUND TABLE.
This interesting arrangement pro
vides a method by which opinion 
may be broadly consulted. Dr. Gar
field purposes making the Williams
Student Council of far-reaching value, 
and, as often as feasible, to bring
even those matters lying strictly 
within Faculty jurisdiction before the 
Council, sitting with the Faculty, for 
discussion. Indeed, he hopes untimately to develop a kind of Round 
Table for entirely informal discus
sions of all sorts of questions. This
will, of course, take time, but it is
all a part of an educative process.
The Williams Student Council is to 
be made up of twelve mensix sen
iors, three juniors, two sophomores, 
and one freshmanelected by and 
representing their respective classes, 
the president of each class being ex 
officio one of the representatives of 
the class.
The institution of such a body 
should be of vital value in the admin
istration of any college. It must ob
viate friction; it must increase har
mony. Dr. Garfields suggestion and 
its quick adoption, both by the trus
tees and by the students, witnesses 
not only to faith in undergraduate ac
tion when properly directed, but also 
to the increasing influence and useful
ness of One of our most efficient col
lege presidents.
A COLLEGE IN POLITICS.
From Wisconsin comes a piercing 
cry to rise and regain political liber
ties that have been lost. Shackled 
voters of that state are told:
Under the old caucus rule, with 
all its faults, you could come together 
in district and county conventions and 
voice your opinions. Under the pri
mary you are as silent as the dead. 
Then, when it came to making a plat
form your delegates set forth what 
you stood for. Now you have not a 
word to say. Formerly every legis
lature was master of itself. Now we 
have forty-six rings called commis
sions, in which is concentrated con
trol over every law.
And, to remedy this appalling po
litical serfdom:
If a Progressive shows his head 
for office anywhere, spot him! Vote 
out the Progressives in either party. 
Put up conservative men. Then, whe
ther Democrats or Republicans win, 
you will have a safe, reliable lot of 
hired men in the legislature.
This is only one among many pas
sionate demands for a revival of the 
precious caucus, convention and boss 
regime under which Wisconsins leg
islature did indeed comprise a safe, 
reliable lot of hired men. No doubt 
the demands are very comforting to 
gentlemen who did the hiring.
For the ruthless destruction of their 
former liberties the bosses very prop
erly lay much responsibility on the 
State University. In the campaign 
that seems to be shaping a return to 
the old regime, Progressives and uni
versity professors are coupled in de
nunciation.
The university, says one spokes
man for the safe and sane, should de
vote its entire time to education. But 
education is exactly what killed his 
crowd.Saturday Evening Post.

MEETING OF THE CIVIL EN
GINEERING SOCIETY.
The C. E. Society held their last 
meeting for the term Friday night, 
June 5th. It proved one of the best 
of the year and in all about thirty 
men attefided. The Plebes electing 
Civil Engineering, were the guests of 
the society. From the number that 
were present, the outlook is bright 
for a larger Sophomore Class than 
we have had in several years. To aid 
the new men in becoming acquainted, 
all wore name-tags.
After the business of the meeting 
had been dispensed with, President 
Culp, for the benefit of our visitors, 
outlined the history of the society 
briefly. Prof. Stanton gave an illus
trated talk on our camp and the 
camps he visited last year. From the 
comparison, it is evident that Camp 
Louise Carnegie has practically all 
the advantages of the others and is 
much more accessible. Some of the 
other camps are located from 200 to 
400 miles from their respective 
schools. A strange coincidence is, 
that all of the camps have about the 
same acreage. Prof. Thayer spoke 
in an interesting manner of the de
velopment of Civil Engineering from 
military, the first form of engineering, 
and of the growth of the other 
branches of engineering with the in
crease of mans knowledge. Prof. 
Thayer was followed by Mr. Penterman (15), who gave some of his im
pressions of our camp life. It seems 
that his chief ones were the good 
cooking and the work while on the 
fatigue party.
Following these discourses the 
meeting adjourned to room 60 where 
there was an enjoyable lunch,
thanks to Mr. Roberts (15).
The remainder of the evening 
was spent pleasantly in telling
stories. The meeting was brought 
to a close when the lights went out at 
11:30 P. M.
CARNEGIE WINS AGAIN.
Geneva fell an easy victim to the at
tack of our crack tennis team, Satur
day, June 6th, at Geneva. Dodds, of 
Geneva defeated Douthett in two long 
sets in which it was nip and tuck for 
every point. The other matches were 
rather onesided in Techs favor. The 
results were:
SinglesDodds, Geneva, won from 
Douthett, Carnegie, 9-7, 8-6; Beeken, 
Carnegie, won from Johnson, Geneva, 
6-1, 9-7; Miller, Carnegie, won from 
J. Mclsaac, 6-2, 6-1; Schuckman, Car
negie, won from M. Mclsaac, 6-0, 6-0.
In the doubles: Douthett and Kee
ken won from Dodds and Johnson, 
6-4, 6-1; Miller and Schuckman won 
from J. and M. Mclsaac, 6-2, 6-1. 
Score: 5-1, Carnegie.
A STUDENT COUNCIL AT WIL
LIAMS COLLEGE.
Five hundred enthusiastic under
graduates of Williams College have 
followed the recommendation of the 
Trustees, and approved President 
Garfields plan for a Student Council. 
Dr. Garfield aims to give to the stu
dent body as large a measure of 
self-government and responsibility as 
is possible under the law, and by 
a method new to Williams, namely, 
a Student Council.
This Council is to assume supervi
sion of extra-curriculum affairs. No 
final action is to be taken by the Col
lege authorities, it is provided, or by 
the Student Council, involving chang
es of policy in matters concerning 
extra-curriculum interests until the 
proposals relative thereto have first 
been discussed and acted upon at a 
conference between the Council and 
the committees representing the Col
lege authorities.
The constitution of Williams Col
lege may be said to consist of the 
laws adopted by the Trustees, the 
rules of the Faculty, and such regula
tions as the student body has from 
time to time adopted. The laws are, 
of course, supreme; the rules of the 
Faculty are subject to the laws of the 
Trustees, but are superior to the reg
ulations of the undergraduates. The 
three sets of laws and regulations are 
therefore something like Federal, 
State, and city laws. There is no at
tempt to shift power from one body 
to another. The body now vested 
with the exercise of a power will con
tinue to perform its function.
This is consonant with President 
Garfields purpose to place upon the 
undergraduates a full measure of selfgovernment and responsibility in ex
tra-curriculum activities. For in
stance, among those activities would 
be the determination of the charac
ter of underclass contests to be en
gaged in under the regulation and 
control of the Student Council. Or, 
suppose it is proposed to enlarge the 
number of baseball games during 
term time. This is a matter which 
the Faculty Committee on Athletics 
has power to decide. Hereafter, how
ever, a meeting of the Student Coun
cil with the Faculty Committee will 
be called for that purpose and the 
matter discussed. If opinion is di
vided, a vote will be taken, and the 
result left with the Athletic Commit
tee, which, later, sitting by itself, will 
decide the matter.The Outlook.
The old system of using a heated 
iron and dirty cloth presses the grime 
and dirt into your garments. Our 
sanitary machine steams it all out, and

A NEW KIND OF INTERCOL
LEGIATE MEET.
On Saturday, May 9, there was an 
important intercollegiate contest. It 
was announced as a meet. It took 
place in New York City, but the New 
York newspapers the next day gave 
no account of it; at least, if any news
paper account appeared, it escaped 
our scrutiny. The sporting pages re
corded the victory of the Columbia 
crew and track team, the Pennsyl
vania nine, the Dartmouth nine and 
tennis team, and the Harvard nine, 
and the defeat of the Harvard track 
team; but no page recorded the out
come of the meet between the Colum
bia, Pennsylvania, Dartmouth, and 
Harvard Glee Clubs.
This meet was held in the evening 
at Carnegie Hall. It was the first of 
its kind. The song contest is an an
cient institution, and it flourishes 
among the Germans and the Welsh 
today; but it has not until this year, 
so far as we know, become an Ameri
can intercollegiate event.
After two organ pieces performed 
by Dr. Davison, organist of Appleton 
Chapel at Harvard, the first contest
ing club marched on the stage and 
grouped themselves in a double 
curved line, with their leader in front 
near one end. The red and blue 
bands across their shirt fronts pro
claimed them the representatives of 
the University of Pennsylvania. They 
sang their song, Some Reckon Time 
by the Stars, by Rogers, and marched 
off to the accompaniment of applause. 
They were at once followed by the 
Columbia Glee Club, distinguished by 
light-blue bands of ribbon, who sang 
Sailing, another composition by 
Rogers. They, in turn, were followed 
by the green-banded men from Dart
mouth, who sang Footes Bedouin 
Song. The last of the four clubs 
to appear, the Harvard Glee Club, 
marked with bands of crimson, sang 
Bucks spirited part song, At Sea. 
This ended the first section. Comic 
relief was afforded by Mr. Morgan, 
of Columbia, in the performance of 
an original monologue. The second 
section consisted of college songs: 
Columbias Sans Souci, Dart
mouths medley, Pennsylvanias Red 
and Blue, and Harvards football 
songs. The next two numbers on the
program were outside the contesta 
fine performance of Rodgers Bedo
uin Song, by the University Glee 
Club of New York, which was en
cored, and a very musicianly violin 
solo by Mr. Griffith, of Dartmouth. 
A special word of praise should be 
recorded for the Dartmouth clubs 
accompanist, who shared with Mr. 
Griffith the credit for this perform
ance of Wilhelmjs transcription of 
the Prize Song from Die Meistersinger. As an encore these two 
Dartmouth men played Beethovens 
familiar Minuet in G.
The last section in the contest con
sisted of the Russian composer Bor
odins Serenade, sung by the Har
vard Glee Club; A Hong Kong Ro
mance, by Hadley, sung by the Dart
mouth Club; Messagers Long Ago 
in Alcala, by the Pennsylvania Glee 
Club; and Swing Along, by the Ne
gro composer, Will Marion Cook, 
sung by the Glee Club of Columbia. 
While the University Glee Club of 
New York sang one of Sullivans part 
songs the judgesMr. Arthur Mees, 
Professor Horatio Parker, and Mr. 
A. D. Woodruffconferred. The 
clubs then all assembled on the stage, 
and the prizes, a library of choral 
music presented by Mr. Rudolph E. 
Schirmer and a baton, were awarded 
by unanimous vote to the Harvard 
Glee Club. The defeated clubs 
cheered the winner, and then all four, 
supplemented by the University Glee 
Club, sang, to organ accompaniment, 
Bullards stirring Stein Song.
In the mind of any listener there 
could be no doubt as to the justice 
of the verdict. The Pennsylvania 
Club constituted a lusty body of 
voices, but lacked fine quality of tone 
and finish of performance. The Co
lumbia Club seemed at times unbal
anced, but gave a good account of 
themselves in Cooks Swing Along, 
and by that one performance probab
ly earned the honorable mention they 
received from the judges. The Dart
mouth Club was more evenly good 
than either of these two other clubs, 
and by the spirit of its singing gave 
the impression that there is at Dart
mouth a distinctly musical atmos
phere. The performances of the Har
vard men were uniformly high.The 
Outlook.

ATHLETICS IN SOUTH 
AMERICA.
Here in this country, just as in Eng
land, it has long been taken for grant
ed that the Latin races are constitu
tionally unfitted for athletics, that 
they lack the essentials which would 
enable them to compete successfully 
in athletic contests against men of 
Anglo-Saxon origin. Though this 
mental attitude may be weakening a 
little as regards the Latin races of 
Europe, it is still persistent in the 
case of the Latin races of South Am
erica. But just as Latin Europe has 
shown signs of a great athletic re
vival, so the nations of South America 
are gradually forging ahead in such 
a manner as will soon force AngloSaxon nations to revise their tradi
tional estimate of foreign athletic 
ability.
In Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and 
even in Paraguay, one of the things 
which strikes the traveler most forc
ibly is the ardent and energetic way 
the youth of each of these countries 
is taking up sport in all its branches. 
Soccer football is played universally, 
and there is an ever-increasing par
ticipation in boxing, bowling, golf, 
basket-ball, swimming, rowing, wrest
ling, baseball, and other sports. Only 
last year a team' of Argentine rifle
men came to this country and won the 
worlds championship.The Outlook.
John D. Rockefeller, Jr., was talking 
rather grimly about charity.
Help a man out of a hole, he said, 
and he may rorget you once hes out. 
But rest assured of this, hell never

from the next hole he falls into.
When were riding in an automo

little if any right to walk the streets. 
When were walking and an automo

that every automobilist on earth ought

TECH WINS AND LOSES.
The baseball team had a very un
satisfactory trip last Saturday, when 
they went to Beatty, Pa., to play St. 
Vincent. Due to poor train connec
tions the game was to be stopped at 
3:15 P. M. For some reason best 
known to our opponents, play was con
tinued after this time until Carnegie 
had lost her lead in the score. St. 
Vincent then left the field in the 
eighth inning and our boys had noth
ing to do but proceed to the station 
to wait for their train.
Tech got the first run of the game 
in the second inning when Humphries 
hit and stole second. He went to 
third on Murphys boot of McDon
alds roller, and scored immediately 
after this on a double steal.
St. Vincent tied the score in the 
fourth. Murphy singled and stole sec
ond and scored a little later on Hur
leys two-base hit.
Tech came across with three runs 
in the sixth. Kreider tripled to left 
and scored on Oeffingers single. Lain 
scored Oeffinger with a double, went 
to third on a passed ball, and scored 
when Thomas made a poor throw to 
first when he fielded Humphries 
grounder. This completed the scor
ing for Tech.
In their half of the sixth St. Vin
cent scored twice. Brink hit and 
Murphy walked. Each advanced a 
base on Decks out. These two scored 
when Oeffinger let Hurleys roller slip 
through him'. The score was now
4-3 in Techs favor and it was time to 
call the game, but for unknown reasons 
the ump failed to do this until after 
the next inning when St. Vincent put 
two more runs up on their side. As 
has been suggested the game was sud
denly called and the St. Vincent men 
left the field, so that Tech could catch 
the train. After waiting an hour the 
train arrived on scheduled time and 
brought the players, who were greatly 
dissatisfied, back to Pittsburgh. Box

SOPH COMMERCIALS WHITE
WASH MECHANICALS, 11-0.
The Sophomore Commercials have 
a team with a perfect record, percent
age 1000; but they only played one 
game. Tyler pitched for them against 
the Mechanical battery of Tucker and 
Staples for this once, which took 
place on Tech field, Saturday morning, 
May 23rd. The high count for the 
Commercials was largely due to the 
speedy playing of Thoma; but New
comb did some really good work. The 
Commercials have the right spirit; 
nine in their section and a baseball 
team.
HASELTON HONORED WITH 
TWO CAPTAINCIES.
Fifteen Men To Receive Track 
Letters.
At a recent meeting of the letter 
men, E. R. Haselton, 15, was unani
mously elected captain of both the 
track and cross-country teams for next 
year. That he deserve the honor con
ferred upon him goes without saying 
and we believe we are justified in de
claring him the best track athlete that 
has ever represented Carnegie. This 
statement is supported by the fact that 
Haselton now possesses the school 
records, including one intercollegiate 
mark, for the three distance races, the 
half-mile, one mile and two-mile runs. 
In every meet in which he ran this 
year except the last one, when he was 
injured, he took part in at least two 
races, usually the two-mile and halfmile, and was never beaten except by 
his own men whom he permitted to 
finish ahead of him. What Haselton 
will do next season cannot be pre
dicted until the effect of his injury 
is learned. But whether he is able to 
continue the pace he set this year or 
not, he will surely be an able captain 
because of the confidence the other 
fellows place in him.
Wrhen the points earned by each 
track man for the year were totalled, 
it was found that fourteen besides the 
manager had earned their letters. This 
is the largest number that has been 
awarded to any track team and argues 
well for the developing powers of the 
coach as well as for the prospects for 
next year. The letter men include 
Manager Miller, Captain Clair, Captain-elect Haselton, McMillan, Camp
bell, Rieser, Kirk, Hemmann, Dunseith, Patterson, Meredith, Finlay, 
King, Wright and Adams.

REPUTATION.
It is a grave mistake for a young 
man to say I dont care what others 
think of me; and What I do is no
bodys business but my own.
That is, it is a mistake if he has any 
intention of reaching success in the 
field of work he has chosen.
For, while our own efforts are pri
marily responsible for success, we de
pend in no small degree upon the 
favor and co-operation of others.
In other words, we build partly up
on our abilities, and partly upon our 
reputation.
We must gain a reputation for 
trustworthiness before we will be 
trusted. We must earn a reputation 
for veracity before we will be be
lieved.
We must build a reputation for de
pendability before we will be depend
ed on.
We must establish a reputation for 
confidence keeping before we will be 
told things confidentially or be given 
confidential work to do.
We must have a reputation for 
square dealing before we will be 
sought by people who insist upon be
ing dealt with squarely.
We must establish, through reputa
tion, which is merely what others 
think of us, our possession of those 
attributes and qualities which find 
favor in the eyes of those people up
on whose favorable relations with us, 
in a business way, our success de
pends.
Dont for a minute think that by 
recognizing the value and seeking the 
good opinions of others you are sac
rificing in any way your independence. 
Rather you are reaching forward to a 
far greater independencethe inde
pendence of the man who, having es
tablished a good reputation, is master 
and not servant of his business op
portunities.New Orleans Dail Times.
THE QUESTION.
Postmaster General Burleson said 
at a banquet in Washington:
One of our postoffice stories con
cerns a postoffice census taken a num. r of years ago.
A question in this census was, 
What are your marital relations? 
The answers to this question were 
startling. One postmaster answered, 
Fair to middling. Another answered, 
Fine. A third, poor fellow, made the 
tragic answer, The worst.

OTHER BIG DITCHES THAT 
RIVAL THE PANAMA 
CANAL.
While the Panama canal is the 
greatest engineering project of its 
kind ever attempted in the worlds 
history, there are several other big 
ditches worthy of attention. Third 
in cost among the canels of the world 
is the famous Manchester ship canal, 
which was formally inaugurated by 
Queen Victoria May 21, 1894. The 
appropriations made by congress for 
the construction of the Panama canal 
amount to $322,541,468. The Suez 
canal, completed in 1869, cost $100,-
000,000, while the Manchester canal, 
standing third, cost $85,000,000.
This Manchester canal, thirty-five 
and one-half miles in length, makes 
a seaport of the great industrial city 
of Manchester, connecting it with 
Liverpool. It is wide and deep 
enough for ocean steamers drawing 
twenty-six feet to dock at the 
wharves. The city of Manchester paid 
one-third of the cost.
The Welland ship canal in Canada, 
when all the proposed improvements 
are completed, will rank high. It 
runs parallel to the Niagara river 
from Port Colborne on I*ake Erie to 
Port Dalhousie on Lake Ontario, a 
distance of nearly twenty-seven miles. 
It was opened to travel in 1883 and 
has since been enlarged and deep
ened, making the total cost of the 
project $26,090,366. The increase of 
the depth from fourteen to twentytwo feet and other improvements will 
cost $30,000,000 more. The Welland 
canal overcomes the obstacle to nagigation between the lakes presented 
by the Niagara falls. *
The Cape Cod sea level ship canal, 
now nearing completion. Is another 
mighty project of this nature. It is 
about a dozen miles in length and 
twenty-five feet deep and by connect
ing Buzzards bay and Massachusetts 
bay will shorten the sea route be
tween Boston and New York by about 
sixty-three miles. The Cape Cod 
canal is expected to be navigable by 
the middle of summer, but will prob
ably not be opened for general busi
ness until November.
The Suez canal, connecting the 
Mediterranean and Red seas, was 
completed in 1869 at a cost of about 
$100,000,000. Most of the labor was 
performed by Egyptians, who were 
forced to toil for a mere pittance, 
barely enough to keep them alive, and 
were watched over by brutal over
seers who constantly plied their lash
es on the bare backs of the Khedives 
slaves.
Germanys greatest canal and the 
most important ditch of continental 
Europe is the Kaiser Wilhelm' canal, 
connecting the Baltic and North seas. 
It was completed in 1895 at a cost of 
$40,000,000. It is a sea level canal, 
thirty-six feet in depth and sixty-one 
miles long.
Longest of the worlds canals is the 
Erie, between Albany and Buffalo; 387 
miles. It was completed in 1826, and 
the cost, with improvements, amounts
to $52,540,800. The Erie and the Os
wego and Champlain canals are now 
being enlarged by the state of New 
York to a depth of twelve feet. The 
cost of the improvement is to be kept 
within $101,000,000.
In the matter of tonnage, the canals 
of the Sault Ste, Marie, while com
paratively short and inexpensive, far 
surpass all the other canals of the 
world. The tonnage passing through 
the ditches connecting Lakes Super
ior and Huron are more than three 
times as great as that of Suez.
The Manchester canal is in one way 
the most remarkable in the world, 
since it was built through a country 
densely settled and with interests 
vested from' time immemorial, thus 
presenting problems not encountered 
in the construction of other water
ways. -__________

Active preparations for the 1916 
Olympic Games, to be held in Berlin, 
are now well under way. In the 
United States, Great Britain, Ger
many, Sweden, Australia, Denmark, 
Norway, to name some of the coun
tries most prominent in athletics, 
plans are fast being formulated.
In Germany, for instance, a com
plete plan has already been adopted 
and is now being worked out in de
tail. A few months ago the German 
Olympic Committee, backed enthusi
astically by the Imperial Government, 
sent Carl Diem, Secretary-General of 
the 1916 Olympic Games, at the head 
of a commission to this country to 
make a detailed inquiry into the rea
sons for our success in athletic con
tests. Acting on his suggestion, they 
have engaged the great athlete Kraenzlein as head of the German move
ment to prepare for the coming Olym
piad. He has now permanently taken 
up his work at the Grnewald Stad
ium, recently opened during the Kai
sers jubilee celebrations, and, follow
ing the method adopted in Sweden, 
Denmark, and Norway, during the 
past winter has been hard at work 
training trainers. Germany in the 
past has not only been lacking in tal
ent already discovered, but has not 
bad men who had the ability to dis
cover it. These trained trainers are 
now engaged in selecting men to be 
trained for 1916. During April and 
May preliminary contests were held, 
and in June each German center will 
send the successful participants to 
compete against each other at Ber
lin.
Sweden, Norway, and Denmark are 
also already engaged in doing some
what similar work, but Great Britain 
has been lagging because of the fail
ure of the appeal for funds made some 
time ago by the British Olympic 
Council and the wrangling which has 
recently gone on among its members. 
Australia is proceeding on a greater 
scale than ever before, and the Aus
tralasian Olympic Committee, con
sisting of delegates from both Aus
tralia and New Zealand, hopes to col
lect at least $50,000 to send no less 
than fifty athletes whom they con
sider have a winning chance.The

Uncle Joe, chewing the end of his

Did you never hear of the New

a housebreaker rose up from behind a 
hatrack in a New York house as the

Throw up yer hands! he said. 
The owner did so.
 Gimme all yer money.
 But, said the owner, but Ive just

We have classified our advertisers so that our readers may use the list 
for reference before making purchases. The grouping furnishes an excellent 
variety of merchants for any article which a student, alumnus or faculty 
member would be likely to buy, and there is no valid reason of which we are 
aware that would justify anyone interested in the welfare of The Tartan in 
making purchases from any but merchants who so kindly make such a publi
cation possible. Be sure, also, to give one of the purchase stubs, which you 
will find enclosed in your Tartan every other week, to the clerk from whom 
you make the purchase. The stubs, we have found, make pleased advertisers 
and help to get new ones. Mav we depend upon YOU to take this as a re

PROFESSOR HOWER SPEAKS 
TO GERMAN SOCIETY.
Wireless Heard Over ''Roofn. , .
____________> y , t? '
A lecture by Professor Hower, act
ing head of the Department of Phys
ics of the Science School,. was the 
feature of a meeting of the German 
Society in Room 209, Applied Science 
on Wednesday evening, May 28. About 
one hundred and fifty were present, 
including a considerable percentage of 
the fair sex. The subject of the talk 
was the recent developments of phys
ics, with especial regard to lighting 
developments concerning which Pro
fessor Hower is an authority of the 
first order.
An explanation of the structure of 
matter, of the behavior of atoms and 
molecules, and of the electron theory 
was supplemented by slides showing 
the paths of molecules, electrons and 
the like, magnified immensurably. Op
posite to the inconceivable distances 
of the stars, which required hundreds 
of years for their light to reach us, 
the speaker gave an equally incon
ceivable example of smallness when 
he said the size of a Beta particle em
anation was to the thickness of a hair 
as the hair was to the entire Atlantic 
Ocean.
Following these generalities, Pro
fessor Hower took up and discussed 
specifically the advances in illumina
tion caused by the coming of the tung
sten nitrogen filled, quartz, and flam
ing arc lamps. The peculiarities of 
the various lights were demonstrated 
and the colors lacking in each were 
shown by the apparent colors of many 
different hiied silks under the rays of 
the lamp in question. Thus if a lamp 
lacked the red rays, the red silk looked 
black by its light, if it lacked the blue, 
the blue was black, and so on.
A special attraction was the wireless 
receiving set operated by George A. 
Kaufmann, president of the Wireless 
Club. An aerial consisting of a single 
strand of very tenacious wire was 
strung from Machinery Hall tower 
to the lecture table in Room 209, 
where the receiving set was attached. 
By connecting a phonograph horn to 
the receiver, the signals could be 
heard fifty feet from- the instrument 
when the room was quiet.
At nine oclock, Mr. Kaufmann got 
in tune with the station at Sayville, 
Long Island, and the audience in 209 
listened to the latest press news while 
it was being flashed out to sea at 
Long Island.
At ten oclock the government sta
tion at Arlington, W. Va., was heard 
and everybody set their watches to the 
fraction of a second by the ticks of 
the receiver sounding every second 
just around ten. A system of pauses 
denoted the tick which meant ten 
oclock.
The time signals were followed by 
weather reports for the entire Atlantic 
Coast from Boston through the Gulf 
of Mexico. This feat of amplifying 
the weak wireless signals is a novel 
one and original with Professor Hower and Mr. Kaufmann. A regret voiced 
by several students was that they 
didnt know of the lecture in time to 
spend a most enjoyable and profitable 
evening there.
NOTICE.
