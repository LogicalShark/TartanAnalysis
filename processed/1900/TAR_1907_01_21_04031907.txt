THE REFERINDEX
A NEW SYSTEM OF INDEXING.
FOUNDERS DAY MEMORANDA.
Especially Adapted to the Needs of the 
Engineer.
By Prof. G. H. Follows. , 
Several years ago I formed the 
habit of making notes of the work I 
was doing, and of its progress. I 
first used for the purpose a special 
printed form bound as a book in a 
suitable cover labelled Subject Book. 
It was a Subject Book because the 
main feature of each entry was the 
name of the subject upon which work 
was being done. The work might be 
making a note, looking up data, issu
ing instructions, experimenting in the 
shop, corresponding, designing, mak
ing a general investigation, filing 
printed matter, reading an article or 
what not.
This subject book, itself intended as 
an index, soon needed an index, and 
I tried several schemes. The best I 
could say of each, after a fair trial, 
was that it worked all right for a 
while; which was just what I did not 
want. What I was looking for was a 
system of indexing that would answer 
for all time, and yet never grow cum
bersome or require re-arranging, and 
that at the same time would not be 
too much trouble to keep up.
The Referindex described and il
lustrated here is the name that I have 
given to the general system of index
ing that finally evolved; the coined 
word being simply a contraction of 
reference index.
The system as I use it, is embodied 
in a three-part book (cards can be used 
if preferred) in three colors; the parts

1910.
Did the Director mean to insinuate 
that the Glee and Mandolin club en
tertainment on the 15th was to be a 
minstrel show? His remarks previ
ous to the concert conveyed that im
pression and some of the boys object
ed to being taken for black faced 
comedians.
By the frequency of class meetings 
held by 1911, one would suppose the 
class were going to do something. 
Wonder what the cause can be.
A wee member from 1911 asked a
1910 man if the date of the banquet 
of 1910 had been decided, and if so, 
Pres. Skeehan had better arrange for 
a body-guard; he intimated that class
1911 had contemplated spiriting Skee
han away. How about this, Jack?
Keating, of 2-C, has not been in at
tendance since the flood. His work 
repairing the damage done the citys 
lighting system, by the high waters, 
keeps him busy day and night. We 
all hope to see him soon.
Wonder if we will get an invitation 
to inspect the new building of the M. 
M. C. S. ?
Mr. A. L. Summers entertained some 
of his friends of the Glee Club at his 
home in Wheeling on Sunday.
A very spirited meeting was held by 
1910, following the talk of the Direc
tor, on the 20th. A large number of 
the class was assembled, and with but 
one or two exceptions, the class signi
fied their intentions of participating in 
the parade on Founders Day.
After a few heated remarks re
garding the comparisons between 
soft hats and soft heads, it was de
cided that all those of the class in
tending taking part in the festivities 
on April 11th wear the steel color 
soft hat adopted by the school.
President Skeehan was chosen 
marshal for 1910 and each section is to 
choose a lieutenant to assist him.
John Skeehan was elected as a com
mittee of one to constitute a body
guard, for the President of the class, 
to protect him from the evil designs of 
1911 on the night of the banquet.

Taylor .of 2-C is quite an orator, as

delivered a straight-forward, clear and 
concise speech on why Derby hats 
should be worn by the class of 1910, 
on Founders Day; and it is a pity 
that his efforts were ifi vain, for his 
motion to make the stiff hat the of
ficial head-covering for members of
1910 was lost by a large majority.

Is the track team doing anything?
There seems to be some new, and

Who is to be next Plebe President?
Dowling looks worried these days. 
Whats the matter, Wink, spring fever 
in the team's ranks? Cheer up!
Were not saying much about basket 
ball. Whats wrong? The team look
ed promising.
Does anything worth while ever oc
cur in the Plebe class? Never see 
anything in the Vartan about them, 
anyway. Its everyones privilege to

tive.
We understand that someone is hav
ing a bill for $30.25 framed.
Did you wear anything with dropped 
stitches on Sunday last? Br-r-r-h ! !
The day school of Applied Science 
seems to be in a trance regarding 
April eleventh! Wake up!!
Four more ex-08! Begins to make 
one think of the charge of the Light

The Mate says he has resigned his 
position on the Transport. He must 
have saved up some money, I reckon!

NEW ENGINEERING MODELS.
Messrs. Seisel and Applegate of the 
Civil Engineering Department have 
completed models of a section of trus
sed roof and a wooden frame truss 
bridge. The work was directed by 
Prof. Thayer. The bridge is a model 
of a single track railway bridge of 
about 120 feet span. It is reported 
that the model which is built to a 
1-12 scale has supported the combined 
weight of five students, gradually ap
plied when Prof. Thayer was not look
ing.

Wanted: To know how many quarts 
in a gallon? Gallagher.
Prof. Otterson looked his best when 
the class picture was taken. He had 
on his summer suit and no one noticed 
it until he called their attention to it.
Gallagher stands ready to meet any 
and all comers in a lemonade drink
ing contest. He has a record of four
teen cups in thirty minutes.
The A. & J. need livening up. We 
understand that all committee meet
ings from that department are held 
on the steps or in the park.
Miller may be right when he says 
the machinists are ahead in every
thing. We think not, however. Where 
were they when it came to paying the 
money ?
DisgustedThe smoker, committee.
Prof. Morris 
x=a little bit.
12x=12 times a little bit or large bit.
We understand that Miller of the 
sign painting department is an ex
acrobat and slack-wire artist. He de
clined to exhibit his prowess at the 
smoker however, saying that he 
could scarcely walk on the side walk 
now.
Toomey suggests corn-cob pipes for 
the smoker.
Taylor, of Applied Science, should 
not get angry when we laugh at his 
mistakes.

is it Mr. P.
InstructorWell, Joe, its a piece of 
lead pipe and a hammer handle.
The plumbers are going to apply to 
the foundry for the job of cleaning the 
cupalo. There were four plumbers 
cleaning out two furnaces on Wednes
day night.
Welsh is with us again. He talks 
as much as ever.
Charley Tillman is able to be around 
again after an illness of three or four 
weeks.
What was the matter with Kounz 
Wednesday night? Doesnt he like the 
way the school is being run. Mr. 
Payne will resign in his favor,, per
haps.
Kounz is a lead burner not a plumb
er: he always manages to burn a hole 
in whatever he is wiping.

W. U. P. VS. TECH.
On last Saturday evening the Tech. 
basketball team met the speedy ag
gregation from the Western University 
in the second and final game of the 
season at Duquesne Garden. Al
though Tech. was decisively beaten for 
the second time by the Wup team, the 
improvement over the rather loose 
playing of last week was apparent at 
all times and in all departments of 
the game. The chief reason for Techs 
defeats throughout the entire season 
has been the lack of association be
tween the players, for when it is con
sidered that the team has been to
gether but two months, it is realized 
that the team play could not have been 
developed to any extent.
Gibson played the star game for 
Tech. and the work of Neudorfer and 
Lytle deserve praise. McWhinney and 
Westover excelled for Wup.

FiS I of coe* *> its
A broad feature of the system is 
that so far as any one man is con
cerned the one book (or set of cards, 
if cards are used) will generally be 
capable of referindexing any sub
ject in *ny place as long as he lives, 
without the necessity of any re-arrangem^nt.
The main purpose of the system is 
to make the process of indexing the 
same for all kinds of data in all kinds 
of places, and to make it easy to lo
cate any indexed information without 
being dependent upon memory.
The book as I use it is shown in 
Fig. No. 2. It will be seen that the 
three parts are so put together and 
thumb-indexed that the pages are me
chanically located. The indexer form 
is used to either bind or paste into 
the front of any book or collection of 
data.
The 'subjects'' are arranged numically as well as alphabetically. The 
numbers are from 1 to 100 in series 
from 1 up; so that a subject number 
consists of two parts; as 47|3, the 
meaning of which is subject 47 of 
series 3. This subject number is 
the base of the whole system, as will 
be understood from the following de
scription of how it is used, in connec
tion with an example, thus:
I decide to enter on page 86 of Note 
Book No. 1 the results of some ex

heading is Drills.
Second: Enter subject in the Alpha
betical index in as many places as 
you think advisable, always in 
connection with the subject num
ber. In this case, under D, in 
column r, the entry made is 
47|3 Drills, Tests of; and (not 
shown here) under T, column 
w, 47|3 Twist Drills.
Third: Assign a Reference page and 
enter the number of it in the 
Numerical index in the column re
served for it. In this case, page 5 
is assigned.
Fourth: Turn to the assigned refer
ence page, enter the subject num
ber in the column reserved for it, 
and make the desired reference. 
In this case the reference is N. 
B. No. 1, meaning Note Book 
No. 1.
Fifth: Turn to the indexer of Note 
Book No. 1, and opposite 47 make 
entry 3|86.
Here the 3 is the series of the 
47, and 86 is the page for the note.
If at any future time I wish to locate 
this note, I turn to the alphabetical 
index and find that drill tests have
subject number 47|3. Turning then to 
series 3 subject 47 I am referred to 
reference page 5, where, opposite 47|3, 
I find Reference N.B. No. 1. Open
ing Note Book No. 1 at the indexer, 
I immediately see opposite 47 the 
entry 3|8G, and the note is located. 
Perhaps the above sounds complicated 
and cumbersome, but the proof of a 
pudding is in the eating, not in an 
itemized list of its contents; and in 
actual use this system has proved 
simplicity itself and a great time-andworry-saver. The original indexing of 
an entirely new subject is in paint of 
fact done very quickly, and the find
ing of previously indexed data is a 
matter of seconds only. The whole 
thing is clean cut in every particular.
The simplicity of the system is per
haps best indicated by Fig. 3, which is 
a summary of all the entries written 
in the case in point.
The more comprehensive the Referindex Book becomes, the fewer addi
tions have to be made to it. Instead 
of having many indexes in as many 
places, and therefore the same sub
ject repeated in many indexes with
out any direct connection between 
them, I have one Referindex book, in 
which the indexing of any one subject 
under as many headings alphabetically
as is deemed wise, becomes of perma
nent and general value in connection 
with any number of books and any 
kind of receptacle for notes or data.
After extended use the one Refer
index book becomes so comprehensive 
that it is not very often necessary to 
add a new subject to the numerical 
index, the additions being mostly new 
references to subjects already number
ed.
In the application of this system to 
the making of notes and the collect
ing of data, I use a rubber stamp as 
shown in Fig. 4, stamping all loose 
notes, correspondence, sketches, the 
pages of note books, data cards, etc. 
The stamp acts as a frame to receive 
the subject number which then serves 
the purpose of a cross index. Loose 
papers and data cards always circu
late back to their proper places when 
so marked and numbered.
Referring again to Fig. 1, it should 
be noted that in this system there is 
very little writing to be done, the sub
jects may be said to classify them
selves, there is practically no waste 
space, and no matter where a note 
may be it can be found with the same 
ease. The use .of printed forms,, made 
convenient by. the system, brings all 
references to the same. subject in 
identically the same relative position 
on every indexer, so that there is no 
hunting through unclassified lists. The 
columnizing of the alphabetical index 
is another feature worth noticing, 
there being a column for the first two 
letters of any word in the English 
language; this makes it practically un
necessary ever to re-arrange what has 
once been entered.
The numbering in series of 100 
makes possible the printing of all sub
ject numbers directly on to forms, and 
tends towards general compactness.
So far as the general working of the 
system and its mechanical features 
are concerned the above will perhaps 
suffice. There are other features, how
ever, not evident on the surface, that 
go to make the whole system of great 
value and render it exceedingly com
fortable in practical application. I 
will mention some that have been 
found useful:
No matter how careful one may be 
in deciding on the classification of a 
subject, one is likely to discover later 
that a subdivision or different classi
fication would be a good thing. Take

the example cited: I may accumulate 
so many data in so many places rela
tive to drills that I would prefer to sub
divide; in such a case all I have to 
do is to add the divisional references 
in the referindex under new subject 
numbers, and make the necessary 
entries in the indexers concerned. The 
notes themselves are not disturbed in 
any way, but the referindex as a key 
to them is rendered more definite at 
the small cost of making a few entries 
in the indexers.
Again, it sometimes happens that 
one would like to connect different 
subjects together, because they bear 
upon one another in some useful way. 
When this is so it merely needs a 
cross reference. For example: I
might wish to connect subject 47|3 
with subject 35|2 (Radial Drill De
sign). Each of these subjects has a 
line on page 5, Fig. 3, where the cross 
references shown are all that are 
necessary.
For indexing articles in magazines, 
catalogues, books of any kind, the 
system adapts itself very happily. For

the same way as explained in connec
tion with Note Book No. 1. Index
ers for different publications can be 
kept together in suitable cover, and 
when a years numbers, as, say, of the 
Engineering News, are bound as a 
volume, the indexer is bound with 
them, and becomes in connection with 
the referindex book a classified guide 
to the articles that have proved in
teresting during the year; and of 
course can be made more complete as 
occasion requires.
I might mention many other fea
turesmatters of detailthat go to 
make this system of indexing a unique
ly elastic and complete one, but what
I would prefer to emphasize is that it 
renders unnecessary any special or 
studied arrangement of notes or data 
as they are made or collected; so that 
no matter how varied the character 
of the data may be, or in how many 
places they may be stowed away, the 
system classifies them and makes it 
easy to locate any desired item.
