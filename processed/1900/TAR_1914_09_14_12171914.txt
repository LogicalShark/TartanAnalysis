Last Saturday afternoon the Pitts
burg Press held its annual indoor 
athletic meet at Duquesne Garden. 
It was an interesting one es
pecially during the A. A. U. events. 
Carnegie Tech, Indiana Normal, and 
P. A. A. had squads entered and the 
events were hard fought and close. 
Carnegies team was comparatively 
small and entered only four events. 
But those who did compete showed 
beautiful form and did some pretty 
running. As a result, in the four 
events, Carnegie gained one first, two 
seconds, and a third place.
In the 60-yard open handicap, Hemmann of Carnegie ran a fine race in 
his heat but came in third by a nar
row margin. In the finals of this 
event Indiana State Normal had things 
pretty much her own way with five 
men running. As a result, Carroll, 
Holland, and Fletcher, three Indiana 
men, crossed the line in one, two, three 
order. Time 6 2-5 seconds.
The one mile walk came next on 
the program and in this event Car
negie was represented by Williams. 
Williams showed his ability by 
landing a second place for the Plaid. 
Starting almost at scratch he succeed
ed in slowly overcoming all of his op
ponents except Moore, the scratch 
man, who gained a slight lead early 
in the race and held it until the end. 
Third place was captured by Schultz. 
Time, 7 minutes 53 seconds.
One of the most interesting events 
of the afternoon was the mile run. 
Carnegie was well represented in this 
event and as a result succeeded in win
ning second and third places. Carey 
and Rieser both managed to keep well 
up in the race and before the half mile 
mark had been reached the former 
worked his way past the other com
petitors and took the lead with Rieser 
not far behind him. But Grumbling 
of Pittsburgh in the meantime was 
steadily gaining and near the last of 
the race took second place. When 
the pistol sounded for the last lap he 
made a pretty spurt and passed Carey. 
Rieser likewise quickened his pace 
and passed over the tape second with

The first Stag Party of the year, 
given by the students of the Science 
School, was held in the Carnegie Un
ion on Saturday evening. This party 
was conducted in a similar manner to 
those of previous years, a.nd furnished 
a very pleasant evening for those pres
ent.
Cake walks were the first events on 
the program, and were very amusing 
to say the least. Several new and 
interesting walks were exhibited, the 
origin of which is hard to determine, 
but reminded one very much of the 
return of two wanderers at the mys
tic hour of eleven-forty-five on Satur
day evening. Of course this doesnt 
apply to the exhibition given by Prof. 
and Mrs. Stanton. This cake walk 
did not continue through its entirety 
owing to the fact that Herr Prof. 
stepped on Frau Profs foot, which 
accident wrecked a perfectly good 
cake walk, and laid up one of the par
ticipants for repairs. Mrs. Stanton 
said that she Avls improving and ex
pected to be out of danger in a day 
or two.
Moving pictures followed the cake 
walks. The pictures included a 
large number of characteristic 
scenes about school. Many of 
those present actually saw them
selves in action in the labs, shops, 
and etc., and to say the least were sur
prised, and much elated by the agility 
with which they went about their 
work. These gloatings were rudely 
shattered when the operator said that 
the alacrity of translation of those 
in the pictures was due entirely to the 
speed at which he ran the machine. 
Following the moving picture exhibit 
the words and variations of several 
popular songs were thrown on the 
screen, and the audience indulged in 
singing them, especially those writ
ten for the benefit of the faculty.
Luncheon was then served by the 
beanery, and as is always the case, 
was entirely eaten, the only complaint 
being that some of the plebes were

In Carnegie Lecture Hall Thursday 
evening, December 10, at 8:00 P. M., 
Prof. W. E. Bancroft spoke on Cold 
Light. Prof. Bancroft is Professor 
of Chemistry at Cornell University, 
and Ex-President of the American So
ciety of Chemical Engineers. Several 
interesting experiments were used to 
illustrate an excellent talk on light 
without heat.
First it was brought out that opaque 
substances when heated give out light 
radiation according to the tempera
ture of the body; also that transparent 
gases under the same conditions emit 
no light. From the candle to the in
candescent carbon lamp, one end has 
been sought,to produce a substance 
of high melting point and little vapor
ization. We have perhaps almost 
reached the limit along this line of 
endeavor in the present perfection of 
the incandescent lamp.
Langley found that the firefly gave 
out light of ninety-five per cent effi
ciency. Professor Bancroft showed 
that this light was chemical and not 
due to some life process of the insect. 
If one grinds up a firefly and puts the 
dust in a bottle for years, upon being 
moistened the light is again emitted. 
This substance, if produced by chem
ists, would necessarily be very ex
pensive. Perhaps, though, the firefly 
principle is not the proper commercial 
phase for investigation.
Various known methods for produc
ing almost cold light were discussed. 
Nitrogen carrying a current at low 
gaseous pressure will have in its cen
ter a spot of emission for cold light 
with an absolute efficiency of ninety 
per cent. Also the well known phen
omenon of luminous paint was illus
trated. According to the speaker, any 
chemical reaction occurring fast 
enough will produce light, and this 
assumption was shown to hold in sev
eral experiments. The specific reac
tions that produce many colors of 
light are almost always known.
One striking experiment showed 
that light could be given off by elec
trodes under a solution.

The basketball situation is begin
ning to take a definite form now and 
with each succeeding practice, Coach 
Marks is getting a better line on the 
material, which when moulded into a 
team will represent Carnegie on the 
floor this season. The Plebe game 
last Friday night brought to light sev
eral new men who should be of much 
service. Green, Slater and Holzworth all showed excellent form and 
give promise of developing into valu
able men. Of the old men Hines, 
Henning, Levy, Humphries and Cur
tis are all displaying an excellent 
brand of ball. Hines is playing the 
same kind of a game which made him 
one of the best men on last years 
team. His shooting and guarding are 
all that can be expected. Henning is 
playing a bang-up game at forward 
and will no doubt make a strong bid 
for one of the Varsity positions. Levy 
at forward is also coming into form, 
after a short rest from a strenuous 
football season. He is now beginning 
to play in the same manner as he did 
at the end of last season, and if he 
can continue the form displayed in the 
Allegheny game of last year, there is 
hardly anything that can keep Levy 
from a Varsity berth. Humphries is 
out for a guard position and the ex
perience he obtained from last year 
should be an invaluable asset to him. 
Curtis gives promise of developing in
to a shooting star. There is another 
man in our midst who, while he is 
not a new man around the school, is 
new at basketball as far as Tech is 
concerned. Chuck Meredith, the 
old Pittsburgh Central High star, is 
leading all the candidates for the cen
ter position. He has all the qualifica
tions of a good center; he is tall, 
rangy and fast and besides is an ex
cellent shot near the basket. Mere
dith follows the ball well and knows 
when to pass. Marshall, last years 
Peabody captain, and one of the best 
men in the local Interscholastic 
league, has not yet reported but he 
is expected out after the Christmas

WEAK AND INCONSISTENT.
In the second issue of this years 
Tartan, the following item appeared 
among the Industry School Notes: 
Industry Plebes may read with bene
fit the Carnegie code published by the 
Science Seniors in the last Tartan, re
garding Plebe customs. Newcomers 
must familiarize themselves with these 
rules, as they hold good for Applied 
Industries. Referring to the Carne
gie Code, we find the first two rules 
to be: 1. Plebes must wear no other
than the regulation cap when in the 
vicinity of the School. (This means 
in the park, including Woodlawn ave
nue). 2. Black socks and ties must be 
worn exclusively. Note Rules 1 and 2 
will hold only until the Friday night, 
one week before Easter vacation. 
Here are the facts in the case.
The cause of the controversy to fol
low is the decision recently passed by 
the Seniors of the Industry School, 
permitting their Plebes to dispense 
with the wearing of black socks 
and ties after the Christmas vaca
tion. There are two objections to this 
action. First, it is clearly inconsistent 
with the attitude of the Industries 
School at the beginning of the year. 
Second, it demonstrates the inability 
of the Seniors to manage the Plebes, 
a fault of which, we have been told 
the Plebes openly boast.
It is really a sad state of affairs in 
any school when the Seniors must ac
quiesce to the demands of the Fresh
men, yet we are not surprised in the 
present instance because the 1915 In
dustry classand our criticism is di
rected only against that classhas so 
far shown an unwillingness to assume 
responsibility. It seems contented to 
take the path of least resistance and 
to avert an obstacle to its progress 
rather than remove the obstruction. 
We appeal to the Industry Seniors to
assert themselves and to do something 
for their school. Here is an opportun
ity. The Carnegie Code has been 
adopted by the Industry School as in
dicated above and as the oldest mem
ber of the student body, the Senior 
Class should help to establish and to 
enforce these new school customs.
A COMMUNICATION.
The following letter was received in 
time for publication last week, but it 
was held over at the discretion of the 
editor:
Dec. 7, 1914.
Editor of The Tartan:
In the November 25th issue of the 
Tartan there was published an 
article which called for students 
to compete for a position then 
open in the Advertising Bureau, name
ly, that of Assistant Business Man
ager. A number of students signified to 
the manager, Mr. G. T. Gleeson, their 
intention of competing, and were led 
to believe that the individual doing 
the best work would secure the office.
Less than a week after this, that is 
on Tuesday evening, December 1, the 
Students Activities Board elected Mr.
H. Wright to the vacancy. Had Mr. 
Wright openly competed with the 
other men? Decidely, no. Then, why 
should he have been elected?
This election was a rank injustice 
to the student body, as a whole, and 
to the men wrho washed to compete, 
in particular. Did the men on the 
board fulfill the trust which the stu
dent body had placed in them?
This election was not valid. The 
Students Activities Board had pub
lished their policy, and they should be 
made to abide by it. The students are 
paying for this wTork, and it is but 
justice that each one should have a 
fair chance of competing for it. Are 
such offices run for the personal ag
grandizement of a few who are politi
cally controlling all offices? Throw 
open this position for a definite inter
val and let the man doing the best 
work, secure it.
A. Kerin.
USE OF A COLLEGE VAVER.
Once again we take occasion to 
quote an exchange and reprint an 
article from The Orange and Blue, of 
Bucknell University, of November 23:
There appeared some time ago in 
a college publication an answer to the 
question What is the use of a college 
paper, anyhow? The article was 
taken from a Western newspaper and 
its satirical and good natured senti
ment makes it wrorthy of a place in 
any college paper.
 In colleges and universities today, 
the college paper is the one institu
tion which cannot be killed. It may 
be on the verge of bankruptcy, its 
promoters may be expelled from 
school, and the editor may have to 
run to preserve his life, and yet the 
old paper still comes out on time. 
The students may not subscribe for 
it, the advertisers may refuse to give 
longer to charity, and the paper may 
be the object of universal ridicule, 
but there is always some fellow who 
will work all night, flunk in classes,
and give his last cent to keep the 
paper alive.
 Of course college papers have 
their fat years like other institutions. 
Their editors do not always need a 
shave, the business manager is occa
sionally seen in a new suit, and fre
quently a body of students will be in
duced to subscribe quite generally. 
Sometimes the college paper is even 
in good repute. Its poetry is endured 
for a season with no show of violence, 
its swollen ideas concerning its own 
importance are charitably accepted, 
and its stories of big athletic pros
pects, increased enrollments and 
brainy faculties are received for the 
truth.
 Perhaps the reason for the longe
vity of the college paper is that it 
has acquired the habit of boosting 
everything that could withstand a 
boost. If there are only five faculty 
members and fifty students at the 
presidents reception the paper will 
write of a great throng of happy 
guests, and when the schools teams 
are defeated in every game there is 
no athlete who is not referred to as 
worthy of a place on the all-star ag
gregation.
 In the early days of higher edu
cation college papers appeared inter
mittently, once or tw'ice a year, then 
the publication stalked forth in month
ly form with long stories and treat
ises; later, the advertisers were in
duced to pay for weekly issues; and 
now any large university should be 
able to publish a morning and an 
evening daily. Whatever becomes of 
the college paper of future years, even 
though it continues to rustle its pages 
in the faces of many non-subscribers, 
it will never lose any of its vigor until 
all things collegiate pass away. 
VACATION.
The Christmas vacation will begin 
tomorrow afternoon at 4:30 oclock 
for Day students and tomorrow even
ing at 10:30 for Night students, 
and will last until 8:30 oclock Tues
day morning, January 5. During the 
two weeks recess, The Tartan will 
not be published, the next issue ap
pearing Thursday, January 7.
The Tartan wishes all of its readers 
a very pleasant vacation, including a 
Merry Christmas and a Happy New 
Year.
GIVES LECTURE ON COLD LIGHT
Coniinued from Page 1 
The speaker did not mean to imply 
that the principles of cold light are 
now known; but rather meant to show 
that the physicists goal or light from 
heated bodies was reached, and that 
the cold light of proper chemical re
action should now be investigated.
A stringent measure against high 
school sororities was adopted at the 
recent meeting of the National PanHellenic Association of American 
College Sororities, at Washington, in 
accordance with which girls who be
long to high school sororities must 
resign before November 15 if they de
sire to become eligible to membership 
in college sororities.

Day after day, O Lord of my life, 
Before Thee shall I stand 
With clasped hands, O Lord of all, 
Before Thee shall I stand.
Under thy boundless sky, O Lord 
In silence, all alone 
With humble heart and tearful eyes 
Before Thee shall I stand.
In this wondrous world, O Lord,
By dutys endless sea,
Amidst unnumbered crowds of men 
Before Thee shall I stand.
W'hen on this world of Thine, O Lord, 
My task shall be fulfdled,
O, King of Kings! silent and alone 
Before Thee shall I stand.
Thy heavenly music let thro the 
groves of my soul ring;
Thy heavenly seat ever the lotus oi 
my heart adorn;
The sweet breeze of Paradise let Thy 
blessings bring 
And all that this mortal Earth will 
beautiful make.
Let all apathy and hatred vanish
as if by Thy magic spell; 
And eternal love and amity thro the 
world dwell 
Thy smile, silent and sublime, let the 
sky from star to star fill 
And Thy immortal glory, O Lord 
Supreme, ever shine over all.
Art thou a flower 
Or art thou a star 
Methought, somewhere I met Thee 
Somewhere in a dreamland 
As the sweetest of the sweet reveries. 
How sweet was thy song
How tender was thy gaze
Ah!all that lost in my reverie;
Still shines in my heart 
Thy two blue eyes like stars.
Hush! pray glide on 
As you gaze on me.
Let your smile meet and mingle 
With moonlight serene and sublime. 
Drunk deep in delight 
Let my eyes rest on that yon silvery 
moon
And my heart with longings infinite 
Be filled with lustrous beams 
From thy two blue eyes.

THE SHILLING.
The first number of the Shilling was 
distributed last Friday in the Margaret 
Morrison School. As stated in the 
first volume of the Shilling which ap
peared last June, wre have felt the need 
of a periodical of this kind for some 
time. The board put forth every effort 
to give the students an issue that 
would please them, and the girls who 
have put their time and energy in 
publishing this magazine deserve the 
thanks and good will of every Mar
garet Morrison girl.
We feel that this number of the 
Shilling is better and stronger than 
the first, and we hope that the second 
number which will appear the second 
week in February, will still be an 
improvement. This is quite possible, 
but can only be achieved by having 
the support and interest of the stu
dent body.
Some of the material in the present 
issue is excellent, and shows that we 
have among us some very capable 
girls, but there is always a chance to 
do a little better, and we hope that 
every girl who has an idea or sugges
tion for the future publications will 
make it known to the board.
To make the Shilling a real, live 
paper, and representation of the true 
Margaret Morrison spirit we need, 
and must have the co-operation of all 
the girls.
To those who may not understand 
the organization of the Shilling, we 
suggest that they read the present 
number. Get interested, girls, and 
dont go home for the holidays with
out a copy!
DR. BRASHEAR LECTURES.
Last Tuesday morning, Dr. Brashear lectured to the Margaret Morrison 
faculty and students on Keplers 
Laws. We are always glad to wel
come Uncle John at any time, but 
we are especially appreciative of his 
lectures. His lecture was supplement
al with lantern illustrations which 
added to the pleasure of the hour, and 
made the lecture even more interest
ing than it otherwise would have been.
Besides the interesting things 
Uncle John tells us about the Sci
ence of the world around us; he also 
brings us a few kind words and some 
good advice about the every-day life 
we are living. We are always glad to 
have him, and we only regret that he 
cannot come oftener.
GUILD TEA.
Monday afternoon the Guild had a 
tea and business meeting in the Recre
ation Hall. Officers were elected for 
the coming year as follows: Presi
dent, Mary Ride; vice president, Sue 
Smith; secretary, Miss Lewis; and 
treasurer, Eleanor Dewey.
Mrs. Hamerschlag talked to the 
girls about the work at Kingsley 
House, explaining how it w^as carried 
on, and telling of the need of funds 
to continue it. The Guild then voted
to give the money it makes this year, 
by the dance, sale of calendars, candy, 
etc., to the Kingsley House, and, since 
so many of the Margaret Morrison 
girls teach there and are interested in 
it, the selection seems to be a good 
one. Plans were also discussed for 
the coming dance. It is to be a Cot
ton Ball and the date is set for Friday 
evening, January the eighth. It will 
be immediately after our return from 
vacation and everyone will have plenty 
of money and no difficulty in securing 
a man. So, girls, rememberJanu
ary 8, 1915. Be sure to go, for you 
will certainly have a great timeinci
dentally you will help the Guild in 
its charitable work.
BASKETBALL.
The election of captains for the class 
basketball teams have resulted as fol
lows:
Senior TeamHazel Freeland.
Junior TeamBlanch Booth.
Sophomore TeamRegina Jacob.
Plebe TeamJanet Mandell.
Games have been scheduled, and 
last week two games were played off.
Senior-Sophomore was the first, and 
resulted in a glorious victory for the 
Sophs. The Senior team, famous for 
its many defeats throughout its four 
seasons of basketball, is weaker than 
ever before. This is due to the long 
hours and heavy schedule which the 
Seniors have, and therefore are unable 
to get in any practice at all. Those 
who do come out and represent their 
class in the scheduled games deserve 
much credit despite the crushing de
feat of 30-0 of last Monday.
The Sophomore class can boast of 
a strong, fast and winning team, and 
every girl on the team is playing her 
best this season.
The game on Thursday between the 
Sophomores and Plebes added another 
victory to the Sophomores record. 
The first half seemed to be a walk
over for the Sophs, but during the last 
part of the game the Plebes held them 
down remarkably well.
The line-up:
Sophomore26. Plebe12.
H. Wassell...............F.................J. Mandell
F. Willis..................F.................I. Richter
R. Jacob...................C....................I. Klenk
M. Rapp.................S. C..........I. Weidhos
F. Burgham............G...................H. Clark
M. Wirth.................G...............M. Everest
The best playing on the Plebe team 
was done by Miss Everest and Miss 
Weidhos.
It is hoped that after Christmas the 
students will take more interest or 
will have more time to exhibit their 
interest in the Inter-class series which 
is being carried on by the class teams.
The winning of the pennant is per
haps between the Juniors and the 
Sophomores, although the Plebes still 
have a chance.
The Junior and Sophomore teams 
wrill meet for the first time this season 
the week after we returnit will be a 
game worth seeing.
The students of Franklin and Mar
shall College have adopted the honor 
system by an overwhelming vote.
BASKETBALL MEN PRACTICING
Continued from Page 1 
recess. Taken all in all, the material 
available for this years team is good 
and the outlook for a winning combi
nation is bright.
The biggest problem that must be 
solved is to find two good forwards. 
Ex-Capt. Criswell and Capt. Tumpane will both be missed by this 
years team. It is quite a bit of illluck ior Tech to lose a man of the 
ability of Tumpane, especially after 
he had been elected to lead the team: 
Tump was just beginning to show 
his true worth and would have un
doubtedly proved himself to be a big 
factor this year. He wras the best 
point getter on last years team. While 
it was a misfortune to lose Tumpane 
nevertheless we felt as if we would 
have a man, who could capably fill his 
shoes, but he, too, seems to be lost. 
Crawford, one of the best basketball 
men developed at Kiski and captain 
of last years championship team has 
been declared scholastically ineligible. 
It is a shame that we should have a 
man of Crawfords ability in the 
school and yet not be able to use him 
in competition. He is undoubtedly 
one of the best forwards in this sec
tion and it is hoped that he will soon 
remove his scholastic deficiency. He 
would prove a tower of strength for 
Carnegie. Crawford is a big man and 
knows how to use his strength in a 
game. It is indeed a clever and strong 
guard who can hold him down.
The men are working out every 
evening with the object of getting 
into shape for the opening game of 
the season with Pitt at Trees gym
nasium immediately after the vaca
tion. Our rivals on the other side of 
the hill are said to possess a strong 
five and it would be quite a feather 
in our cap if we could conquer them. 
The basketball team expects to make 
as good if not a better showing than 
the football squad and they are begin
ning to live with this game in view. 
The cry is, Beat Pitt, and with a 
repetition of the spirit shown by all 
at the football game this thing is not 
at all an impossibility.

Heretofore there have been occa
sional complaints about the existing 
system of distributing student mail. 
Letters have been lost and others have 
been misplaced and not received by 
the addressees promptly. It was rec
ommended at one of the Assembly 
meetings not long ago that some 
method be put into operation which 
would eliminate this condition. 
Through the co-operation of the 
school administration a distribution 
center for student mail has been estab
lished in the Central Building. An 
employee of the institution will have 
complete charge of all student mail 
and it is to be hoped that the installa
tion of this new system will do away 
with any future cause for complaint. 
The new post office will undoubtedly 
be in operation with this edition of the 
Tartan.
Many of the students are unaware 
of the fact that room 111, next to the 
switchboard station, has been set aside 
as a study room. A large table and a 
number of chairs are available and 
students desiring a place for quiet 
study will find 111 an admirable ad
junct to the school.
At a recent meeting, the Plebe class 
elected to give to upper classmen a 
smoker January 22nd. This promises 
to be a first class affair from the way 
the Plebes are arranging for it.
Word was received from Mitchell, 
Plebe president and Varsity end that 
he will return to school after the holi
days.
Fritz Oeffinger, another man, is fast 
recovering from his recent operation 
at the West Penn. Many students 
have visited Fritz, several of the fac
ulty also having given him a call.
Heyl, Plebe Teacher, has been ap
pointed second assistant basketball 
manager.
SVEAKS AT VHILADELVHIA.
Dean Connelly addressed the Metal 
Manufacturers Association of Phila
delphia at their annual meeting at 
the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel, Phila
delphia, on Wednesday evening, De
cember 9th. He spoke on the sub
ject of Vocational Education with 
particular reference to the remarkable 
report recently issued by the United 
States Commission on National Aid to 
Vocational Eduction. He had a num
ber of large charts made to illustrate 
the talk.
On the following day the Dean left 
for Richmond, Virginia, to attend the 
Eighth Annual Convention of the Na
tional Council for the Promotion of 
Industrial Education, in session from 
December 9th to 12th. A feature of 
this convention was the unique pro
gram built on a survey of the City of 
Richmond for the purpose of Indus
trial Education. The survey was made 
sometime ago, but it has been left to 
this convention to discuss the finding 
and recommend its adoption, if favor
able, to the City of Richmond.

DESIGN SCHOOL NOTES
LECTURE ON 
GREEK COSTUMES.
Dr. AofrBb EmBrson, of Art Inst.tutB, 
LB&turBs.
Last Thursday afternoon, in the De
sign Theatre, Dr. Alfred Emerson, 
Archaelogist of the Art Institute, Chi
cago, and formerly of the American 
School at Athens, lectured to the stu
dents on Greek costumes. He ex
pressed a need of a knowledge of cos
tume for the proper interpretation of 
Greek plays. The stage is the only 
means nowadays where one has the 
chance to study the practibility of 
costume.
Mr. Emerson pointed out the differ
ence and history of costume for each 
of the Greek cities. The costumes of 
the Greeks were about seven and onehalf feet long and seven and one-half
feet in circumference, with shoulders 
pinned in, skirt drawn over girdle. The 
overhang from the shoulders gave sev
eral artistic folds. On the feet sandals 
and shoes were worn, sometimes high 
hunting boots were used. Wreathes, 
head bands, fillets, bracelets and ear 
rings were used extensively, while the 
men wore rings principally.
The Greek was, Mr. Emerson says, 
made up in a manner something simi
lar to the modern woman. The dress 
was vari-colored and of many designs. 
They never used the fret much and 
white gown as is pictured today, but 
were gorgeous in every manner. He 
established a similarity of the modern 
costume to that of classic times. The 
Roman costume is somewhat similar 
to Greek except for toga. The Greeks 
costume on first place originated from 
the garments of many tribes, which 
they adapted to their needs. Our 
modern garments leads us back to the 
barbaric races where it originated 
mostly.
MR. HORNBOSTEL LECTURES.
Last Friday morning Mr. Hornbostel lectured on Yucatan and Mex
ico. He had many new photographs 
which were thrown on the screen. Mr. 
Hornbostel took most of the pictures 
himself when down in Central Amer
ica studying the architecture of the 
e&rly North American races. The 
lecture was most interesting and gave 
one the knowledge of the wonderful 
civilization of those people.
DRAMA STUDENTS GIVE VLAY.
GrBBk Voly l Su&&Bss.
The faculty and trustees of the In
stitute were present at the production 
of Euripides tragedy, Ophigenia in 
Tauris last Saturday evening, De
cember 12th, in Design Theatre. The 
play was a grand success and will be 
repeated for the students at a later 
date. A short musical program by the 
Symphony Orchestra under direction
of Prof. J. Vick OBrien was ren
dered. An interesting feature of all 
plays given by the Drama students is 
that all scenery and costumes are de
signed and made in the school.
GRAND.
An extraordinary program of 
vaudeville will be offered at the Grand 
Opera House Christmas week begin
ning Monday afternoon, December 
21st. An especially interesting num
ber is indicated by the engagement 
of B. A. Rolfes Company of four
teen players in The Lonesome Las
sies, a petite musical comedy written 
by Will M. Hough, author of The 
Time, the Place and the Girl, A 
Southern Cinderella, etc.
The production will be flanked on 
all sides by vaudeville acts internation
al reputation to the number of nine 
and will be followed by a selection of 
motion pictures showing important 
events in the European War.

SCIENCE SCHOOL NOTES
MR. OSBORNE LECTURES ON 
BIG BUSINESS.
The students were given a rare op
portunity Wednesday, December 9, 
of hearing Mr. Ely Osborne, vice 
president of the Westinghouse Elec
tric and Manufacturing Company, on 
the subject of Big Business.
Mr. Osborne dwelt at some length 
on the mistaken impression given by 
the words Big Business. We get the 
impression of aFrankenstein created 
by man but grown so large as to be
come entirely uncontrollable.
There is no exact point fixed as 
dividing big and small business.
The term big is as one might say 
Made in America and has become 
an approbuous term but Mr. Osborne 
sees no reason why it should be so.
Although the common idea is that 
monopolistic organizations are crea
tions of the present age, yet in the 
ancient time there were monopolies 
just as strong as any one today. The 
old trade guilds were as much monop
olies as the Standard Oil Co.
Although in Europe the aristocratic 
class looked down upon the trades
men, in America the people all worked 
with their hands. Gradually the in
dustries developed until with the ad
vent of the steam engine, specializa
tion of industrial products started. The 
industries thus started grew to large 
proportions and developed rapidly and 
at the same time sharp competition 
increased.
The largest businesses were those 
of the railroad companies. The com
petition having grown to great pro
portions alliances between the rail
roads and certain of the larger com
panies were found in order to lessen 
competition, and as a consequence the 
industrial concerns were given lower 
and preferential rates. Between 1870 
and 1890 the large combinations and 
consolidations were formed. These 
were called Big Businesses. In or
der to increase capital watering of 
stocks was resorted to and this prac
tice, more than anything else, is re
sponsible for the public feeling against 
Big Business.
The trusts were formed for two 
main reasons, states Mr. Osborne. 
First, in answer to an economic de
mand, and second, as a natural growth 
for more efficient working. The great 
unfriendliness is due to the latter be
cause of the favors granted which are 
not open to the average individual.
Too little censure is exercised over 
the political control of these Big 
Businesses. The danger of such 
control aroused the people who were 
determined to destroy the power of 
these large units. The reformers and 
muckrackers aroused the minds of the 
people but made not a particle of dis
crimination between the good and bad 
side of Big Business.
The people as a whole can forego 
any immediate advantage to settle this 
question of monopoly and undue ad
vantage but should not lay aside the 
fact that lessened competition is the 
death blow of successful operation.
In conclusion, Mr. Osborne said, 
All that business men can hope for 
is that a realization of the serious
ness of the case will come and that 
every patriotic American will help to 
solve the question.
The competition problems offered 
by the Engineers Society of Western 
Pennsylvania to the students of elec
trical, mechanical, and civil engineer
ing departments were give out last 
Monday.
JUNIORS HOLD DANCE IN 
UNION.
Under the spur of W. E. Boaks 
plea at a recent class meeting for a 
little more social life among the Sci
ence Juniors, these same Juniors held 
a dance in the top floor of the Central 
Building Tuesday evening, December 
15, 1914. The seasonableness of such 
an informal affair just before the 
Prom was another reason for hold
ing it. A. S. Hines was chairman of 
the committee in charge.
A fuller account will appear in a 
later issue.

CHESS TOURNAMENT ENDS.
HorBo.&k Agl.n RBturnBb thB Chlm
p.on.
The second annual chess tourna
ment of the School of Applied Sci
ence has been completed, and the 
champion of last year, Harry Hore
lick, Jr., Mech., again came out the 
victor. Second honors were split be
tween Pickering and Levine, a Senior 
Chemical and Senior Commercial re
spectively. The progress this fasci
nating and mathematical game has 
made at Tech is shown by the fact 
that this year Gorzo and Domovos, 
beside those men already mentioned, 
defeated C. Thomas Patterson, the 
founder of the tournament, who for 
a seven-game battle tied last years 
champion.
The tournament this year was en
tered by twenty-three men, six of 
whom finished. The plan of having 
each contestant play two games with 
every other was new this year, too. 
This tournament was confined to men 
of the Science School; but since men 
in the other schools are interested 
also, an inter-school tournament has 
been suggested.
Dr. M. G. Brumbaugh, governorelect of Pennsylvania, is a graduate 
of Juniata College.
LECTURE ON RADIUM.
The joint meeting of the Crucible 
C. M. E. S. and Mho Clubs was held 
in room 208, Wednesday, when Dr. 
Viol, of the Standard Chemical Com
pany, spoke on Radium.
Dr. Viol is an Indiana man, a grad
uate of Purdue. After leaving Pur
due, Dr. Viol went to Chicago Uni
versity, where he studied under Prof. 
McCoy. On writing his thesis for 
degree, Prof. McCoy urged Dr. Viol 
to take up Radium. Dr. Viol was 
not much enthusiastic over it, but fin
ally consented. A little later the 
Standard Chemical Company needed 
a man to take charge of Radium pro
duction on a large commercial scale 
and strange to say the only man in 
America capable of filling the posi
tion was Dr. Viol, and so that is how 
the Standard came to have a 26-yearold chief chemist.
President Ernst, of the Crucible 
Club, introduced the speaker and the 
audience were much surprised at the 
youth of the person who got up to 
speak. After the first few words, 
however, it was plain to be seen that 
the speaker knew about all there was 
to know about the subject.
Radium, said Dr. Viol, is mys
terious stuff and has changed our 
notion very much as to what an atom 
is.
M. Henri Becqueral is given the 
honor of being the first one to notice 
the radiation and emission of rays 
that affect the photographic plate, 
but to Mme. Curie goes the honor of 
having separated radium from its 
myriad surroundings in pitchblende.
In 1898, two Frenchmen, prospect
ing in Colorado, discovered a mineral 
or ore called carnotite, a potassium 
uranal vandate, from which ninetenths of the worlds supply of radium 
is extracted. Dr. Viol showed by 
means of slides, various steps in the 
extraction, etc.
At Canonsburg, the Standard Co. 
has a large plant for the manufacture 
of radium from carnotite. The ore 
is comparatively pure, it requiring 300 
to 500 tons of ore to obtain 1 gram 
of pure metallic radium. The 300 tons 
of ore is first reduced by various pro
cesses until about 1,000-1,500 lbs. of 
radium or radium salt is left. The 
radium is separated out from this

Most of the radium made is used 
in medicine. The radium salt is put 
in a silver case glass tube, about threequarters of an inch long and oneeighth of an inch in diameter and 
contains 22-25 milligrams of radium 
chloride of a value of $2,400.
Dr. Viol had one of these small 
tubes with him to demonstrate the 
wonderful properties of radium.

LECTURE ON RADIUM
Continued from Page 8
requires some very delicate measure
ments and instruments. Advantage 
is taken of the electrical properties of 
the radium in the gold leaf electro
scope. The rate of discharge of the 
electroscope is observed by observ
ing the rate of fall of the gold leaf. 
This gives a measure of the quantity 
of radium influencing the instrument, 
which is naturally calibiated for a 
certain fixed amount. With this in
strument one can detect with ease 
one ten millionth of one gram of 
radium so that of the 500 tons of 
raw ore we should need only two 
ounces to get a very accurate determi
nation.
Radium gives off three kinds of 
rays, alpha-rays, beta-rays, and gam
ma rays. The gamma rays are very 
penetrating, and will go through sev
eral inches of lead very easily.
The disintegration of the elements 
started from uranium and proceeding 
through radium down to radium g 
was taken up. "At radium g, said 
Dr. Viol, "we come to the end of 
the string. After much investigation 
it was found that radium g is lead. 
Thus the large amount of lead in 
radium ores may be accounted for.
The life of radium may be said al
most to be indefinite, only half of 
a certain quantity being gone in 5,000,- 
000 years.
Dr. Viol showed a few of the sim
ple experiments with the radium he. 
had and then consented to ask any 
questions any one asked.
The meeting adjourned for some 
very excellent refreshments, everyone 
voting the meeting the best ever.
VLEBES SHOW GOOD FORM.
Duquesne University Freshmen
BBltBn By S&orB of 46 to 11.
Last Friday Night at the Field 
House, an all-Carnegie Plebe team 
opened the local basketball season by 
defeating the Duquesne University 
Freshmen five by an overwhelming 
score of 46 to 11. The Plebes took 
the lead at the beginning of the game 
and were never headed, in fact it was 
only a matter of how many points they 
would roll up in the allotted time. 
Carnegies first year men gave the ap
pearance of a well balanced team and 
showed a fair amount of team play 
considering the short time they have 
been together. All the men displayed a 
considerable amount of basketball tal
ent and several of them should fit well 
into the Varsity combination. Green 
and Slater at forwards played a fast 
game. Green proved to be a good 
shot from the floor and negotiated ten 
field goals, while Slater excelled from 
the foul line. Holzworth played a 
good guarding game until removed in 
the second half on account of an in
jured ankle. The opposing team found 
it difficult to get the ball past him, 
while Shortys long reach enabled 
him to gather in several long passes. 
Duquesnes men were off on their 
shooting and missed many chances at 
the basket. Callahan played well for 
the visitors. A good sized gallery
was present, a fact which augurs well 
for the coming Varsity season.

R. W. HUMBLE DIES AFTER 
OVERATION. 
AttBnbBb TB&h BBforB EntBr.ng 
VBnn StltB.
Ralph W. Humble, of Pittsburgh, 
a Penn State student, died in the Bellefonte Hospital at Bellefonte, Pa., last 
Saturday morning, following an opera
tion to remove a carbuncle from his 
lower lip. The remains were sent to 
the home of his parents, Mr. and Mrs. 
George T. Humble, 332 Arabella 
street, Knoxville, and the body was 
later taken to Bridgeport, Ohio, for 
burial.
Humble was a Tech student before 
entering Penn State. He played on 
the Plaid football team of 1912, his 
plebe year, and was a members of the
track team during the indoor season 
the following winter. He was very 
popular among his schoolmates and 
was the president of his class. In 
1913 he went to Penn State College 
where he ran on the track team. This 
year he made an unusually good show
ing as a cross country runner. His 
untimely death marks the close of a 
very promising athletic career.
NEW YORK CLUB GETS BUSY.
Full arrangements for the smoker 
of the New York Club, the newly or
ganized brother of the New England 
Club, were made last week to hold it 
at the Hotel Schenley last night, De
cember 16, 1914. Officers were to be 
elected and the committee on the 
drawing up of a constitution was to 
be appointed, which would perfect a 
permanent organization. Thomas L. 
Gleason was the temporary chairman 
of the club, which is open to any 
member of the Science, Design, or 
Industries School whose home is in 
New York State.
Thirty thousand persons attended 
the Army-Navy game this year. An 
incident which enlivened the game 
from the standpoint of the spectators 
was the divesting of the coat from 
the Middies "goat by the Cadets, an 
occurrence which cost the Navy pangs 
of regret only exceeded by those of 
defeat.
