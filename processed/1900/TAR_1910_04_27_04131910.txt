TECH WINS OPENING GAME.
TA Comedy of Errors.
VOL. IV
MDm (Tnilnn
PITTSBURGH, PA., WEDNESDAY, APRIL 13, 1910No. 27
A long time ago one, Wm. H. Shakespeare, wrote 
a play called A Comedy of Errors. He was very 
foolish to write his play at such an early period for 
he did not then have complete information on the 
subject. He should have waited until after Saturday 
last and seen the opening game before writing. No 
one then could, or would, question his right to make 
his play. He would have been an authority on the 
subject of errors.
As the great Wagner once may or may not have 
said, Errors are a good thing when taken at inter
vals and in small doses. Boneheaded plays have no 
right to live and they should be sent to Mr. Poufts 
for operations. The errors we can excuse, be
lieving that with more practice we can develop a 
good team from the material on hand. But for such 
boneheaded base running and base throwing there is 
no excuse. Once a bonehead, always a bonehead 
holds true.
In respect to errors and true boneheaded plays we 
were not at all in the class with Pitt. Outside of the 
first inning, we played fairly decent ball until along 
about the seventh. There is where we started in 
to show Pitt off and very nearly did that and handed 
them the game besides. Maybe we caught it from 
Pitt who knows?
Captain Coldren made several changes in his line
up during the game. Beisgen started the game as 
pitcher and ended up in the middle garden. He 
was much more successful as a pitcher than as a 
fielder, pitching very good ball during the seven 
innings that he was in the box. Captain Coldren 
played at shortstop, Siegal at second and Vatz at 
third. Mason, Blanchard, and Wehr opened the 
game in the outer pastures.
Pitt scored the first crack off the bat, helped along 
by Lechs errors. In the second Morehead was safe 
on Simpsons error. Wehr put the ball in short left 
field for a single. On a wild throw both Morehead 
and Wehr scored. Siegal walked and went to second 
on Vatzs life. At this point Umpire Boulfiois drop
ped his coins and the game was delayed 3% minutes 
while he, the catcher, and the batter searched for 
them.
When the game was resumed Rayburn was safe 
on errors and scored on an error by Wright. Beis
gen walked. Mason knocked up a high one and was 
out and Kirk knocked a roller to Kipp, who caught 
Beisgen at second. The inning was chiefly marked 
by the poor work on the bases.
In their half of the third Pitt was unable to do 
anything.. Coldren opened for Tech and was safe 
at first. Morehead knocked out a fly. Wehr sent 
out a grounder that was too hot for the infield to 
handle, Coldren scoring and Wehr taking third. 
Siegal knocked a grounder toward Logan, who 
promptly made an error, Siegal safe at first, Wehr 
scored.
In the fifth Mason copied Merkle and failed to 
touch second and was put out. In this inning Tech 
scored three more runs, Siegal, Reyburn, and Beis
gen doing the work. This ended Techs scoring.
In both the eighth and nine Pitt scored two runs, 
very nearly tieing the score. They were greatly 
aided in this run getting by Tech's errors. They 
were able to connect more freely with Urghardt than 
with Beisgen.
The features of the game were the errors, the bone
headed plays, and Boulfrois. The score:

The School of Applied Science of the Car
negie Technical Schools, announces a course of il
lustrated Lectures, open to the public, to be given 
on Wednesday evenings during April and May.
The titles and dates are as follows:
April 13Prof. S, S. Keller 
A Trip to the Stars, with Stop-Over Privileges.
April 20Dr. John A. Brashear 
Contributions of Photography to our Knowledge of 
the Stellar Universe.
April 27Prof. J. H. James 
Rubber and Its Applications.
May 4Prof. H. S. Hower 
Electric Waves and Wireless Telegraphy.
May 11Prof. W. E. Gibbs 
The Science of Musical Tones.
May 18Prof. W. E. Mott 
Regulation of Street Traffic in Large Cities.
These lectures are planned to give the busy citi
zen an opportunity of bringing his knowledge of 
some branches of science up to date.
The course is intended especially for those who 
have an interest in science but may have been una
ble to devote sufficient time to their reading to keep 
abreast with modern scientific achievements.
Considerable variety will be found in the short 
course here announced. Professor Kellers lecture 
on A Trip to the Stars, With Stop-Over Privileges, 
will serve to refresh our knowledge of Astronomy 
and call our attention to some recent discoveries in 
that field. This lecture will serve as an introduction 
to Dr. John A. Brashears lecture on Contributions 
of Photography to our Knowledge of the Stellar Uni
verse. Dr. Brashear will illustrate his lecture with 
an excellent collection of photographs. Many of 
these were taken with apparatus designed and con
structed by Dr. Brashear in his Optical Works, and 
his intimate personal acquaintance with the astron
omers whose work he will describe will add greatly 
to the interest of the photographs.
Professor James will give an illustrated lecture 
on Rubber and Its Applications. Professor James

has given much attention to this branch of Chemis
try and will trace the history of rubber from the 
tree to its various final forms. He will explain the 
adulteration of rubber products. This will interest 
all automobile owners.
Quite different in character will be the lecture by 
Professor W. E. Gibbs on The Science of Musical 
Tones. Many a person, even though he be a mu
sician, has scarcely given the physical nature of 
sound a thought. The nature of sound and the vari
ous characteristics of tones will be illustrated by a 
series of experiments.
Electric Waves and Wireless Telegraphy will be 
the subject of a lecture by Professor H. S. Hower, 
illustrated by a series of interesting experiments. 
The general subject of electric waves and their 
similarity to ordinary light waves will be illustrated 
by reflection and refraction of the waves. The 
wireless telegraph will be in operation across the 
lecture room, and a brief resume given of the com
mercial achievements up to date.
The regulation of street traffic in large cities, has 
been a subject of special study by Professor Mott. 
He will take up the methods used in the various 
cities and give us a glimpse of busy corners in Lon
don, New York and Boston, leaving us to make the 
application to Pittsburgh.

The regular monthly meeting of the Carnegie Me
chanical Society was held in Mechanical Hall Satur
day evening, April 2nd. In the business session the 
chief item of interest was authorizing the social com
mittee to provide a good feed at the next meeting of 
the society.
Departing from the custom of bringing in a speaker 
from outside to furnish entertainment for the meet
ing, the experiment of having a debate by members 
of the Society was tried. The question chosen 
for the evening was Resolved, That the Shop Offers 
Greater Opportunities to the Young Engineer than 
the Drawing Room. Four members were chosen to 
uphold each side of the question: C. A. McCollum, E.

---------------------------------------------------

THE TARTANi
C. Danner, D. K. Reid, and J. W. Considine, on the 
affirmative; J. K. Reed, W. L. Munk, J. L. Williams, 
and E. F. Noonan on the negative. These are all 
night men, the day men who were asked to take part 
declined. Owing to the absence of Munk on the nega
tive side it was decided, after much discussion, to 
allow Prof. Trinks to speak for the drawing room. 
After selecting three judges, of whom H. T. Woods 
was chief justice, the debate was opened by McCol
lum, speaking lor the shop end of the question. His 
graphical representation of the rise of the young en
gineer in shop and drawing room was very interest
ing, but the blackboard was not high enough to plot 
the salary of the shop man as president at the end 
of ten or fifteen years, nor long enough to plot the 
time the chief engineer served at $3,000 per year. 
If the five minute limit set on each man had not been 
up Mac would probably have kept on in his happy 
manner for half an hour at least. Reed, in opening 
the argument for the negative side, brought out 
points of more congenial work, shorter hours, and a 
better chance to learn the construction of machines 
for the man in the drawing rooms. Danner, the sec
ond speaker for the affirmative, jumped the fence un
intentionally when in defending his side by relating 
the career of a young man trained in a shop, told 
how he had been promoted (!) from the shop into 
the drawing room. Prof. Trinks aided the negative 
side strongly by telling of two men of his acquaint
ance who had become eminently successful, trained 
through the drawing room alone and summarized his 
remarks by saying that just as strong arguments 
and just as successful careers of shop men could 
be brought out for the affirmative side. D. K. Reid 
put up the strongest argument for the shop side, 
bringing out chiefly the point that anywhere he had 
worked there had been a larger number of opportuni
ties for shop-trained men than for daughtsmen. Wil
liams and Noonan both had goods points for the nega
tive and Considine, for the other side, was in his 
usual humorous mood attacking all the arguments 
brought out by the negative side. After a five minute 
summary by McCollum for the affirmative and Reed 
for the negative, the judges retired. They did not 
seem able to agree on a decision easily but after Reid 
had passed their way with one hand significantly in 
his trousers pocket, they came in with a decision in 
favor of the affirmative. After another round of 
cigars and some general discussion on the question, 
the meeting adjourned, everyone declaring it to have 
been one of the best this year.
The meeting in May will be the last one this year 
and although the program has not been announced it 
has been decided to have something first class. And 
then therell be that extra attraction in the refresh
ment line; so all you Mechanicals be sure to be there.

Manager Dlvernois of the Orchestra has issued an 
urgent call for men.
To date, the turnout at rehearsals has been far 
from satisfactory. Very little enthusiasm has been 
evinced, in proportion to the enjoyment to be had by
the members of the Orchestra in the evet of its re
ceiving the appointment of official orchestra for the 
White Friars. This, of course, cannot be realized 
unless there is more interest taken in the organiza
tion, and better attendance at the rehearsals.
Performers on the viola, bass viola, trombone, 
cornet and flute are urged to be present writh their 
instruments at next rehearsalSunday, April 16th,
3 p. m., in the club room, A. & J. building.
The management hopes that the showing and work 
of the orchestra will permit of the booking of several 
out-of-town engagements, in addition to quantifying 
as the White Friars Orchestra.
All you musicians make careful note of the date, 
416103 p. m., A. & J. and be on the job on time.

The annual dance of the club was held Wednesday 
evening, April 6th, and as usual a large crowd was 
present and at a late hour departed for their homes, 
all having enjoyed a very pleasant evening.

Next Saturday afternoon the Varsity will meet 
Westminster College on Tech Field, which promises 
to be an interesting contest. Reports from New 
Wilmington claim that the Westminster lads expect 
to land a victory.
Many changes were made in the line-up last Satur
day and the coachs expect to do so until they find 
the right man in the right position.
Captain Coldren is now playing short stop in order 
to let Vatz hold down the third sack. Coldren is fast 
rounding into shape and wrhen the game starts Sat
urday he expects to be in the best of condition.
The Varsity has several practice games scheduled 
for this week which will help to develop the players.

Last Wednesday members of the Senior Metallur
gists and Miners, accompanied by Mr. Meyer and 
Mr. McIntosh, visited the Ellsworth Mines of the 
Ellsworth Collieries Co. and the Marianna mine of 
the Pittsburgh-Buffalo Co.
At Marianna the superintendent, while granting 
the liberty of the surface plant, would not permit the 
party to go down the shaft, fearing that the men 
would mistake Neel, Scholl and Styri for scabs. 
An inspection of the surface equipment, however, 
proved very interesting and instructive, everything 
being enormous in size. The plant is about twothirds completed.
Upon arriving at Ellsworth the party repaired to 
the hotel for dinner, where Mr. Meyer predicted that 
the handsomest man in the party would be served 
first. The waitress wrent right past Scholl, and be
gan with Mr. McIntosh.
The officials at Ellsworth were most courteous, ex

tending to the party the freedom of the entire plant.
The method of plotting mine maps by coordinates 
was carefully explained. An exhibition of the Jaeger 
rescue apparatus was particularly interesting, sev
eral of the party expressing a desire to try on the 
helmets and oxygen tanks. The engineer in charge 
readily consented to arrange for a trial later in the 
afternoon, but lack of time interfered with the plans 
and the try on had to be foregone.
The afternoon was profitably spent in looking over 
the washery, power equipment, and, particularly, the 
provision made for utilizing hot smoke from the 
coke ovens for firing the boilers.

In the opening game of the season, at Braddock, 
the Tech Freshmen were defeated by Braddock 
High School by a score of 62.
The game was spirited and well played through
out. Hits, with the Freshmen, were conspicuous 
by their absence. Carts, probable pitcher for the 
Pittsburg Collegians, was very effective for Brad
dock. Baird, in usual form, threw winning ball, 
but disadvantageous grounds permitted of poor sup
port. Score in detail follows.
Saturday, the 16th, the Freshmen meet East Lib
erty Academy on Tech Field in a preliminary to 
Tech-Westminster game. Game will be called at
12.45 P. M.
Come out, Plebes, and root for your team.

Occasionally a bit of news floats in concerning 
our small alumni, but is few and far between. Three 
interesting items have come lately, proving in a 
way, what Margaret Morrison girls can do with 
their education. Kitty McMillan, a graduate of last 
year from the Secretarial Department, has an
nounced her intention of going to China as a mis
sionary. Harriet Ellis, of the Household Arts De
partment last year, is holding an excellent position 
with the Fleischmans Yeast Co., in Cincinnati. Ac
cording to Dean West, Miss Ellis has made a name 
for herself since leaving this school last year. Eliza
beth Sheets, who is at present Assistant to Profes
sor Esquerre in Chemistry, has lately announced her 
engagement 'to Mr. Fred Gaston, a former student 
of Tech Applied Science. Miss Sheets, as will be 
remembered, was Associate Editor of the Tartan 
last year, and was a member of the Household Arts 
Department.
Miss Moran, who has been away for six weeks on 
a business trip to New York and Boston, has re

turned and taken up her regular classes in~dressmaking.
Miss Runnette, one of the office force in our 
building, leaves her position there on Monday to 
take another with Mr. Beatty in the Art Institute. 
Miss Runnette will be sadly missed, for her pres
ence in the office seems as natural and as important 
as most of the instructors in their class rooms.
Miss Stoner coached a play entitled, The Spin
sters Fortnightly Club, which the Presbyterian 
Church of Brownsville recently presented.
The last basket-ball game of the season was 
played in the gymnasium Thursday afternoon, be
tween the Juniors and Plebes. The game started 
promptly at 3.30. Both teams were in fine condition 
and intense excitement prevailed during the game.
During the first half, the Juniors had the ball most 
of the time, and the playing was fast and furious. 
The Plebe guards showed up to excellent advantage. 
The first half ended 131 in favor of the Juniors.
In the second half the Plebes played a better 
game and ran the score up a little. The game ended 
with a score of 205 in favor of the Juniors. The 
line-up was:

Tech girls were prominent in the Musical given 
under Miss Fishers direction at the Washington 
Park Playground last week. A large audience of 
children applauded with delight the numbers given 
by Miss Mary Fearnley, reader, and Misses Lillian 
Caldwell, and Helen Oursler, soloists, with Miss 
Steiner at the piano.
On Saturday, April 2d, Miss Bradt, of the House
hold Arts Department, was asked by Mrs. Oliver D. 
Thompson to take charge of a luncheon given at her 
home in Sewickley in honor of her daughter, Mrs. 
Donald Thompson. The invited guests, twelve 
young matrons and prospective brides, spent the 
morning in preparing the luncheon under Miss 
Bradts direction, and when all was ready, sat down 
with the hostess and teacher to test the fruits of 
their labor.
This is the second affair of the kind given by Mrs. 
Thompson during the past few weeks.
We are beginning to wonder if the two dollars de

As we understand the term, there is a vast dif
ference between the critic and the knocker. The 
former is a man who has formed an intelligent judg
ment from his own knowledge of conditions, and who 
has the courage to state his convictions in public 
and in the presence of the men whose actions he 
disapproves; the latter generally knows little or 
nothing concerning the true state of affairs, and 
makes his derogatory observations only before such 
people as he knows are perfectly safe.
The former is actuated by a desire to reform, and 
is a valuable and even necessary factor in the life 
of any community; the latters motives are malic
ious, and he serves only to stir up discontent, and 
to cast into disrepute those who are striving to ac
complish things for the common good.
We do not agree with those who hold that he 
who does nothing for the university himself should 
not presume to criticise those who are actively en
gaged in college affairs.
On the contrary, we believe that the student torganizations and all other persons and institutions 
should come in for their share of criticism, and, in 
fact, are most effective when most criticised from 
an intelligent point of view. No man should hesi
tate to express his views, but he should state his 
disapproval to the persons most concerned, for only 
so can any good result.
Let us encourage the critics, but let us discoun
tenance and seek to eliminate the knocker.

Year Night Class of the Carnegie yechnical Fchools 
in the Department of Vpplied FcienceT died yhursday 
night at h oclock at the Mercy HospitalT following 
an attack of pneumonia lasting only a few days.
Mr. oauli was a native of mubeckT sermanyT com
ing from a prominent family of that city. He has 
been a student of the Carnegie yechnical Fchools 
for three yearsT having been admitted to advanced 
standingT and was pursuing a course in mechanical 
engineering. aeing of an independent natureT Mr. 
oauli has steadfastly refused any financial help from 
home and has worked his way through yech*. Vfter 
his graduation here this JuneT he was to have re
turned to sermanyT marry the girl who has been 
waiting for him several yearsT and then enter the 
engineering profession.
He was without a relative in Vmerica. His father 
has cabled to have the remains sent to his home in 
sermany and Mr. seorge H. Fmith of his class has 
the matter in charge.
One of the little things that counts for so much 
was noticed at the base-ball game on Faturday. 
From the reason that we think in this case it was 
thoughtlessness it is entirely unnecessary to men
tion any names in connection with the incident.
V man having no official connection with the stu
dent body at the present time and not a member of 
a team at any time during his connection with the 
FchoolsT was very much in evidence during the game 
wearing a Varsity letter on the front of his jersey. 
Fuch a thing is so entirely out of place that we won
der that it had the chance to occur... We think that 
in the event of such a thing happening againT a po
lite request should be made the offender to either 
remove the C or turn it to his back.
yHE VmMV MVyEl.
Our purpose of waiting for this issue to deplore 
the wretched singing of the Vlma Mater on the 
occasion of the Founders visit was due to the factT 
that he received copies of that number. ut was 
nothing short of a disgrace. Men who can remem
ber yards of comic opera hits find it hard to re
member. OthersT we are led to believeT have ncit 
sufficient interest and do not care to make the at
tempt. On the otther handT there has not been a 
time or occasion this year when uthe student body 
en masse have made use of this or any other yech 
song. What is the matter with having some of them 
sung at the base-ball and foot-ball gamesT since the 
male population of the plaeo never get togelther in 
any considerable numbers at any other times?

Substitution for the Toss: Instead
coin to determine which side gets the ball the two

the period. If he answers correctly he advances 
the ball two yards. If in addition he gives the sci

yHE CHOuCE OF V olOFEFFuON
James H. Canfield leviews Field of Opportunity.
Professor James H. Canfield, former Librarian of 
Columbia University, Chancellor of the University 
of Nebraska and President of Ohio University, has 
written for the Yale News the following article on 
the choosing of a life work. Since Professor Canfield 
has made a study of this particular subject and is the 
author of a work upon it, The College Student and 
His Problems, he is eminently fitted to describe the 
business opportunities open to the college grad
uate:
To any student asking advice as to choice of his 
life-work I would say that as to the older professions 
there is very little discussion possible, except to 
call your attention quite sharply to a marked dis
tinction between the practice of law and medicine, 
and preaching and teaching,a distinction which 
may have part of its force in the fact that the last 
two are salaried professions, in which you advance 
more quickly to reasonable competence than you 
do in the first two. You must wait a long time for 
recognition and wTork very hard, as either lawyer 
or doctor; but at forty-five years of age you are in 
your professional prime, and normally the great 
successes of your life are to come in the next twenty 
years, decline not becoming apparent before your 
sixty-fifth year. But as a teacher or preacher, in a 
certain sense your prospects grow dim from your 
forty-fifth year on; the dead line of fifty is soon 
reached, and after that you are in perpetual dan
ger. Younger men, trained by better methods in 
later schools of thought and practice, are pressing 
hard upon your heels; your own income'has been 
too meagre for you to do all you ought in the mat
ter of keeping touch with the world; your fresh
ness is departing, and this means a distinct loss in 
efficiency and power; and public sentiment has al

10THE TARTAN
ready practically determined that while you may 
be so fortunate as to retain a place for many years 
above fifty, you will rarely be called to a new posi
tion after you have passed that age, and still less 
often will you be put on your feete if you happen 
to fall after you have reached that age. I am not 
undertaking to turn you either toward one profes
sion or away from another, but you ought to know 
the fact just stated.
Having written this, it may not be out of place 
after all for me to add a few sentences of sugges
tionscarcely more than suggestionconcerning 
these same old honored callings. It is noteworthy 
that in all four there is an increasing demand for 
administrative skill and executive ability. The fore
most lawyers of our day are often little more than 
high grade advisers in business affairs,a state
ment peculiarly true of the renowned corporation 
lawyers. The most successful ministers are those 
who know how to organize, how to set machinery 
in motion, how to bring things to pass The educa
tional world is eagerly searching for men who can 
successfully supervise the schools of a city or the 
departments of a college or university. The gen
eral practitioner of medicine is more nearly inde
pendent and self-centered than the others; and it is 
probably more true of him than of the others that 
he works alone, and not very far from old lines 
though the advance in surgery is quite as great as, 
say, that in electrical engineering. The result of 
all this is both the need and the development of 
quite a new set of qualities as the condition of suc
cess. You must examine yourself carefully, in the 
light of the new demand, before you enter upon the 
old professions with hope of success.
Fortunately a college-bred man is no longer shut in 
to the four old-time professions. With all their honor 
and length of days, these now have sharp competi
torscallings which honor as surely and reward 
even more lavishly. Engineering in all its phases 
electrical, mechanical, civil, mining, sanitary, marine 
is a remarkable illustration of the rapid rise of a 
new profession to a position of the greatest dignity 
and power. Architecture is side by side with this, 
healthy in rivalry and hearty in co-operation. Land
scape gardening lags but a little in the rear, and 
forestry is beginning to attract attention. Even art 
and music are more commanding than in earlier 
years; better, perhaps, are reverting to their earlier 
and worthier positions. In all these directions is 
opportunity, incentive, promise, appreciation, honor, 
and more than competence. All these differ from the 
older professions in this at least, that there is room 
and demand for great ingeiiuity, for invention, for 
contrivance; a constant temptation toward original 
investigation and research. With the older callings, 
movement is along regular lines, long since deter
mined and settled; with the new, everything is un
settled, except a very few fundamental propositions. 
There is peculiar room for individuality, for audacity, 
for freshness of thought as well as vigor of think
ing.
Much the same demand comes from the world of 
commerce and from the world of production. These 
words are written while the cry for organization, is 
unprecedented in the world's history. Never has 
there been such imperative need of clear brained, 
large-minded men, resourceful men, men preeminent
ly of the hour and for the emergency, men who can 
show the result of the highest training, men who 
have responded to every opportunity, and therefore 
can be trusted to answer this call.
All of this vast field is open to college-bred men, 
as to others; and at least three-quarters of it is open 
to college-bred men as to no others. Not that there 
are not so many opportunities for you to make direct 
use of Latin or French, or higher mathematics or 
philosophy or history or literature; but that there is 
a special demand for the trained mind, the keener 
perceptions, the more accurate thinking, the greater 
power of concentration, and the larger vision,all 
of which ought to have come to you with and from 
your college life. And for the men with such quali
ties and powers, promotion is sure and rapid. In 
all this, and in enlarged freedom of choice, you are 
far in advance of those graduates who even fifty 
years ago faced the outer world for the first time, 
as you are facing it today.
Not only has there come this larger outlook in 
the new professions and commerce and in produc
tion, but the territory has been wonderfully extended 
geographically; and this in itself necessarily means 
increased opportunity. Roughly speaking, there are 
open to your choice the three great divisions of your 
own country, and the scarcely greater outside world. 
The more striking characteristics of each, those 
which at once appeal to a young and untried man, 
are these:
The East is still a land of tradition, precedent, 
conventionality. The currents of all life run in more 
set and determined channels, with banks high 
enough to prevent any sudden overflow. If you have 
family prestige, or available inheritance of any sort, 
it will not take you long to get on your feet; precise
ly as you can always borrow money if you can put 
up gilt-edged security. But the prevailing attitude 
will be that you are not to be deemed successful 
until you have proven your case beyond peradventure; and that you are always and everywhere handi
capped by your youth. Great enterprises and gray 
hair go together, if safety and dignity and general 
respectability are to be considered and conserved. 
The largest money resources, the greatest amount of 
available wealth are still in the East; and these are 
always conservative. Nothing will look after itself 
more carefully and more cautiously and more suc
cessfully than a dollar, unless it be two dollars; and 
the dollars are still near the eastern seaboard. Gen
erally speaking, therefore, you will find the start 
more difficult along the Atlantic coast. On the other 
hand, there is more here to do withas the phrase 
goeswhen you are once fairly under way. In law, 
medicine, and theology, and in trade and commerce, 
it is undoubtedly true that most of the great prizes 
are still east of the Alleghanies. Great undertakings

have their origin here; you are at the beginning of 
things, you are brought face to face with men of 
world-wide reputation. If you can succeed here, in 
the service of such men first and in competition with 
them afterward, you win marked success, you rise 
rapidly, and you will doubtless touch a much high
er mark. But it will take time; and before you win, 
you may fancy that it is time but slightly differ
entiated from eternity.
The West has more freedom of movement, and 
grants more ready recognition. Its life is still 
something like that of the colonies, where there is 
necessarily large equality in origin and resources. 
These people feel that they have much to do for 
themselves which has been accomplished already in 
and for the East by past generations; and they are 
not so very particular as to who does it, or as to 
how it is doneprovided only that it is done. Ac
complishment rather than instrumentality, ends 
rather than means, results rather than methods; 
this is their spirit. Their inquiry of a young man 
is, What can you do, and do right now, and do for 
this community? In their social life, as in their 
business relations, they presume a man worthy until 
he shows .that he is not. If you wish to be accepted 
at once, upon presumptive merit, without much ref
erence to your ancestors and with very little inquiry 
as to your pedigree, go West. It is a country whose 
leisure class is almost wholly in the penitentiary or 
by the roadside; and it still has a place and a recog
nition for the energetic, for the active, for the am
bitious, for the well-equipped young man. It is an 
especially good field within which to practice the 
newer professions to which reference has already 
been made.
In the Soutth is even greater conservatism than 
in the East; yet warmth, cordiality, courteousness 
sincere, simplee, and from the heart. Its traditions 
are grounded upon a rock, and its people turn very 
slowly from the old to the new, largely because they 
honestly prefer the old rather than the new. They 
feel that there is something in life besides the hurry 
and stress and strain, and better than these. To a 
young man with character and temperament already 
somewhat in accord with the existing conditions 
there, and not very anxious for public recognition 
or to get rich, the South presents many attractions.
You will understand, of course, that all this is but 
a rough chalk-talk of these varying conditions. The 
distinctions and differences are by no means so 
clearly marked as even ten years ago, and lines 
which have long been sharply drawn are now fast 
being obliterated. Kansas is as civilized as New 
York, Minnesota and Wisconsin are as attractive 
as New England, St. Louis has as sound business 
methods as Philadelphia, Chicago is developing a 
social and literary and artistic life which will place 
it side by side with Boston, there is a great com
mercial outlook for New Orleans, and an equal 
promise for manufacturing and mining in the mid
dle Southern States. You will find men of ability, 
of sound education and training, of industry, of am
bition, wherever you go. There is no more dearth of
good timber in the West and South than there is in 
the East, there is no more overcrowding in com
mercial lines in New York than there is in Kansas 
City or .St. Paul. If you go in any direction be
cause you think that you are more necessary there, 
regardless of your positive merit and effective value, 
you will be sadly deceived in the first week. No 
section of this country is longing for you, the proces
sion of advancing civilization has not halted by the
l oadside for you to appear and take the lead, no one 
is waiting for you anywhere. Whichever way you 
turn, you must be prepared to win your way. Every
where, however, there is something to be done. If 
you can do it, and do it well, especially if you can 
do it better than the other fellow can, your success 
is assured.

Albert Vystroem, of Stockholm, Sweden, who ac
cepted a fee several years ago from the Royal Swed
ish Anatomical Institute for possession of his skele
ton after his death and subsequently met with a re
fusal from the institute when he sought to buy him
self back, appealed today from the decision of the 
lower courts, which held that the institute had a 
right to Vystroems framework, which it need not 
relinquish unless it chooses.
Vystroem was destitute when he made the bargain 
but has since come into a fortune. He argues that 
the agreement is of a nature to put a premium on 
murder, in case the purchaser should become im
patient to possess his skeleton, and, as such, is con
trary to public policy. The institute maintains that 
there are peculiarities in Vystroems construction 
which it desires, in due season, to investigate more 
closely than is possible except on the dissecting 
table.
Another thing particularly annoying to Vystroem 
in the lower courts decision was an order that he 
pay damages to the institute for having had two 
teeth extracted without the institutes permission, 
the latter having put in his counter-claim when 
Vystroem began suit against it.
