ANNUAL FALL FESTIVAL IS A MESS
Frightful but Bloodless Battle Fought on Tech Field
DIRECTOR WELCOMES 
NEW STUDENTS
president church talks at 
annual mass meeting.
Welcome to the Plebes and greet
ings to the upperclassmen was the key
note of the annual mass meeting of 
students of all schools in the Design 
School Theatre, Friday, September 
16th, at 11:00 A. M.
The showing of M. M. C. S. equalled 
that of the other schools combined 
when they completely filled the center 
section of the theatre and overflowed 
on the wings. Never before did the 
girls have such a delegation at a stu
dent mass meeting. Even the green 
ribboned Plebes marched up to the 
front seats under the watchful eyes of 
the Sophomores, and to the lockstep 
whistle of the boys.
Before the arrival of the Director, 
Bill Randall got in his hand again as 
cheerleader and Merker of the Indus
tries School led Amici until the walls 
rang. The exercises proper were
opened by Secretary Field, who acted 
as chairman until Mr. Hamerschlag 
came. His greeting to the students 
contained the following words: Dont 
think your duty to yourself or to your 
Alma Mater is ended when you enter 
classes. Enter some student activity 
and it will help you all through the 
year. After announcing the after
noon games, he expressed the spirit
Continued on Page 3
' One of the largest crowds on record 
was seated in the grandstand Friday 
night to watch the annual fall festival 
Fully one-half were of the fairer sex 
and many others were strangers at
tracted by the success of last years 
production.
The festival of this year was on 
somewhat similar lines with that of the 
preceding year, but on a much larger 
scale. Longer speaking parts and bet
ter scenic effects had been added by 
Prof. Stevens in conjunction with Mr. 
Field, and a much larger number of 
students took part. The eats this year 
were not public but were confined to 
the Soph-Plebe smoker later in the 
evening.
The audience seated themselves 
with the aid of the light of two search
lights on the roof of the Margaret 
Morrison School which were so ar
ranged that the field below was invis
ible as though hidden by a fog of 
inky blackness. About half past eight, 
strange sounds were heard, ensuing 
from the direction of the Field House, 
and into the centre of the field a very 
barbarous looking band of Indians, 
much bedecked with paint and feather, 
wended their ghostly way, and made 
camp by their tepees. Chief HokeyPokey was the sachem of this tribe 
who as Sophs, represented the aboriginies of the country.
While the assembled warriors were 
holding a very clamorous pow-wow, 
another band, representing the Plebes, 
made their appearance and with a 
series of blood-curdling yells demand
ed access to the hunting ground of the 
Sophs. Chief Hokey-Pokey refused 
this request in a curt, terse, and ungentlemanly fashion, which so outraged 
the feelings of the Plebe braves that 
they forthwith commenced an extreme
ly sanguinary and noisy battle. Guns 
flashed and roared and clamorous and 
pathetic cries arose from the wounded, 
so moving the Plebe chieftain that he 
hoisted the white flag and asked for 
an armistice.
A council was held, the hatchets bur
ied, and the peace pipe was smoked, 
after which the heads of the Plebe tribe 
listened to a stern lecture from the all
wise head sachems of the race, the 
Seniors. Their promise to be less pre
sumptuous in the future and to keep 
their proper place was satisfactory so 
the two tribes mixed and everlasting 
peace was declared.
Then to the light of a huge red C. 
outlined on the opposite hill, the class
es lit red fire and danced around the 
field. The enormous pile of wood, 
built by the Plebes that morning, was 
lit, and to the roar of the flames was

hLEBES SHOW SUhERIORIbY 
IN WRESbLINm AND IN
DIAN BALL.
The class contests between the 
Sophs and Plebes were held last Fri
day afternoon. In years past these 
events were known as Class Fights, 
and while the fighting part was omit
ted this year, the excitement and en
tertainment they furnished for the 
spectators proved equal to that caused 
in former years by the respective class 
numbers attempting to imitate the Eu
ropean powers by trying to change 
their opponents map.
The events of the afternoon opened 
with the wrestling matches in which 
the Sophs were defeated, only after a 
game fight. Hammerlocks, half-Nel
sons, and other various holds wrere oc
casionally resorted to by the wrestlers, 
although most of the time they either 
used a strangle hold, or a hold resem
bling a bunny hug,* which caused a 
green Plebe from Freeport to ask if 
the boys were giving a demonstration 
of the latest dances.
Hand ball followed the wrestling. 
This proved to be one of the most 
exciting of the events on the program. 
In this contest it was necessary to pass 
a hand ball from the man at the head 
of a line of twenty-five men to the 
rear man who then ran two hundred

bO bHE FArULbY.
In the endeavor to raise the standard 
of our weekly paper which is essen
tially a student enterprise, we are ap
pealing to the faculty to lend us their 
aid. In the past, many of the profes
sors have readily and cheerfully as
sisted us, but generally speaking, the 
relations between the faculty and the 
Tartan, though friendly, have not been 
as intimate as we believe they should 
be or as we should like them to be.
It is our aim as well as our business 
to keep our readers informed as to the 
events that are taking place about 
school and to present that information 
in as clear, concise, and interesting a 
manner as possible. Yet there is little 
chance for doubt that the sphere of 
knowledge of the professors is much 
wider and broader than that of the 
students. The former come into con
tact with people and affairs and condi
tions in which the latter are interested 
but of which they have no means of 
learning. We, therefore, urge the 
members of the faculty to increase 
their contributions to our news col
umns.
During the course of a yearss work, 
we are sometimes called upon to ex
press our views on debated questions. 
At other times we see fit to offer sug
gestions that in our humble opinion 
we believe may effect an improvement 
or eradicate an existing evil. And we 
often wonder how our position will be 
received by the faculty. Usually, how
ever, with a fe\* notable exceptions, 
our stand is neither approved nor dis
approved.
Our purpose here is not to complain, 
but to request the faculty to co-operate with us to a greater degree than 
they have heretofore. We feel confi
dent we shall derive lots of benefit 
from their criticism and advice, and 
in return, we hope our meager efforts 
may prove of some value to our teach
ers. Let us endeavor to become bet
ter acquainted. In the words of Dean
Leete so well expressed last Thursday, 
let us strive, from' a Tartan standpoint 
among others to make this year worth 
while.
IMhORbANb NObIrE.
The Tartan is always glad to receive 
and publish communications from any 
source, referring to matters of interest 
to the student body or to the faculty. 
Such communications must be signed, 
but the name of the writer will be with
held if it is so desired. The editor-inchief will be pleased to meet on Thurs
day afternoons at 4:00 oclock in the

bHE FALL FESbIVAL.
The directors and participants in the 
Fall Festival last Friday evening are 
to be congratulated on the success of 
their endeavors. That such a pro
duction is unique in this vicinity was 
attested to by the large and enthusi
astic audience. The time of prepara
tion was very short so that the amount 
of work undertaken and accomplished 
was indicative of the spirit and energy 
with which those concerned accom
plished their task. The general plot 
of the festival was excellent, in that it 
conveyed the idea intended, symboliz
ing the struggle for supremacy between 
the entering class and the Sophomores 
and the downfall of the Plebes, clos
ing with the admonition of the Seniors 
that they observe the customs and tra
ditions as handed down to them, and 
not endeavor to presume or rise above 
their proper station in the scheme of 
things. May the festival of next year 
be a still greater success until in time 
it may become a part of the dramatic 
life of the city and one of the scenic 
events of the year.
bHE SEANNArHIE SOrIEbY.
The Seannachie was organized 
March 6th, 1912, by upper classmen 
who saw the need of an organization 
in the school which would give voice 
to the opinions of the majority of the 
student body of the institute and, 
through the influence of its members, 
bring about needed steps in the im
provement of school conditions.
It should be considered the highest 
honor of a mans college career to be 
elected to this society and to assist 
in the growth of his Alma Mater. The 
society elects its own members from 
those men who have shown themselves 
leaders in the various recognized Var
sity activities, and aims to bring to
gether the leaders of the mens schools 
in a common fellowship for the better
ment of conditions about the schools.
Such a society deserves the hearty 
co-operation of every man in the 
school. In fact, the society can not 
fulfil its object without the willing 
support of the entire student body. 
Every man in the school should be 
vitally interested in the school activi
ties. Every man may see some way 
in which some one or more activity 
may be helped. Put your suggestion
in writing and sign it without fear of 
publication. Give this to some mem
ber of the Seannachie and you will be 
doing something to better conditions 
in the school. The Seann--1'*-eciate the past co-operation of the stu
dent body and hopes for a continuance 
of it in the year 1914-15.
A list of the present members fol
lows: R. S. Wilson, Jr., president; W.
F. McCaughey, vice president; W. F. 
Welch, secretary-treasurer; H. D. Balsinger, E. R. Hazelton, F. L. Rownd, 
H. W. Pentermann, E. S. Rauh, J. A. 
Cameron.
bHE rARNEmIE rODE.
As the Carnegie Institute of Tech
nology grows older the customs and 
traditions become more firmly planted 
in the hearts of the student body. Of
ten, however, these customs and tra
ditions can be corrected or eliminated 
with benefit to the school. The Science 
School found that the methods of haz
ing that were becoming prevalent were 
neither amusing nor conductive to a 
feeling of loyalty on the part of the 
Plebe to the school. The hazing was 
never harmful but rather silly and 
childish with practically no redeeming 
features. The ill-feeling caused by 
some of this foolish hazing often 
turned the friendly rivalry that should 
exist between Plebe and Sophomore 
into enmity.
The Senior class met, and as there 
seemed no suitable way of correcting, 
they planned to eliminate haz
ing altogether. They decided 
that it was possible to instill 
into the hearts of the incoming class 
the due respect and loyalty to their 
Alma Mater without humiliating them 
in a manner as undignifying to the 
Sophomore as to the Plebe.
It was with this idea that a com
mittee was appointed to revise and 
add to the old rules so as to form a 
new code and to eliminate hazing. 
We, as the committee, have not tried 
to humiliate the Plebe. We have, how
ever, tried to make the rules so that 
ne wriil realize that he is the newest 
mmber of a well organized and pro
gressive body and has much to learn 
and much to unlearn.
The Plebe should recognize his 
position and be proud to wear the in
signia of the class of 1918. He should 
be proud of his class for, in his opin
ion, it is the best class in the school.
By following carefully and scrupu
lously the rules set down for him he 
will win the respect and admiration of 
his seniors in Carnegie. Not only that, 
he will win respect for himself and his 
class and aid his Alma Mater in estab
lishing more firmly than ever the tra
ditions of Carnegie.
The Sophomore and upper classmen 
should thmk before criticizing the 
work of the committee. Remember 
t^at it is not what the Plebes are 
asked to do but how they do it that 
conts. We do not seek to suppress but 
merely to place the Plebe. All the 
upper classmen must aid the commit
tee by reporting to the Senior Class 
any infringement of the rules that 
come to their attention.
The committees work is only beDIRErbORY

DIRECTOR WELCOMES STUDENTS
Continued from Page 1 
of the school when he said Any hard 
feeling there may be is supposed to go 
out of existence this evening with the 
burying of the hatchet. Professor 
Stevens of the Dramatic School an
nounced his plans for the Indian fete 
of the evening, and made a call for 
volunteer students for the chorus. The 
work of Professor Stevens has made 
the outdoor entertainments of the In
stitute the talk of everyone.
The next speaker was one who de
serves the thanks of everyone with a 
stomach, Dr. Esquerre, the man at the 
head of our now perfect commons, and 
the Head of the Department of Stu
dent Health. He said in part: Last
year when I took charge of the De
partment of Student Health, every
body said to me, If we only had good 
things to eat! We have tried to give 
you this and your support is to be 
shown' by a hearty patronage. With 
no rent to pay, no light to pay, no 
equipment to pay for, we have given 
you a dinner for twenty cents; and 
what you should eat. You dont know 
what to eat, but I do; and if you will 
trust me, I dont think you will be 
sorry at the end of the year. The 
management informs me that a good 
deal of bread has been left on the 
plates. You should remember that 
what you are given is what you should 
eat. If you dont like bread, try to 
cultivate a love for it so you can eat 
the three pieces.
After Supervisor of Athletics McCulloch had announced the pro
gram for the afternoon, a detailed ac
count of which will be found else
where in this issue, the Director en
tered. With his usual thoughtfulness, 
he saw that all possible standing stu
dents got seats before he began his 
talk. He said in part:
Following the annual custom, we 
have met here to welcome the new 
students. . . . The custom was
established some years ago of reducing 
hazing to a minimum. The engineer
ing students have decided to eliminate 
it this year, and I take off my hat to 
them.
But there is another kind of hazing 
different from such barbarous prac
tices as some schools have, which has 
a very good effect. It reduces the 
swelled heads of the new students, 
and inculcates reverence for their 
elders in the minds of those who in 
America often lack this respect in the 
home. This is the living up to a set 
of rules prescribed for the Plebes by 
the Seniors, for first of all, you new 
students, ought to be familiar with the 
spirit and ideals of the whole Carnegie 
Institute.
I would like to see the annual mess
age go to Mr. Carnegie, a message of 
hope in this trying year of great Euro
pean war, a message from this school 
where all registration records have 
been shattered, while, if anything, our 
standards of admission have been 
strengthened.
The Registrar, Mr. Tarbell, in
forms me that without doubt all rec
ords have been broken, that while five
hundred and eleven made up the en
tering class last year, this year it num
bers between six and seven hundred. 
It is said only fifteen to twenty per 
cent of high school students go to 
college. That would be one hundred 
and twenty for all Pittsburgh. Already 
seventy-five of these have registered 
here.
First of all, we represent high 
scholastic standards. We want men 
and women to come in determined to 
fit themselves for their lifes work. 
And the spirit of work ought to be 
the spirit of the real professional 
school, it is here. Men and women 
come here who are hungry, and not be
cause they are sent.
Now, Im going to give you a per
sonal message. I want your thoughts 
and your bodies to be strong and 
virile. And I want you to cultivate 
friendship among your classmates. 
Nothing more precious will be given 
you in Pittsburgh than the opportun
ity to get acquainted with some fellow, 
some girl. (Great applause and laugh
ter.) Get these two, the friend and the 
inspiration, and with the leadership 
of the deans, I think we will add so nething to the Tartan, to our Alma 
Mater.
Colonel S. H. Church, president of 
the Board of Trustees, established a 
precedent in addressing the new stu
dents.
The double debt we owe to society 
was his theme. First, we owe an ac
counting of ourselves; and then of 
someone else who would be in our 
place if we hadnt crowded them out. 
The story of the launching of a great 
battleship which wouldnt start carried 
a point with it. The elaborate launch
ing machinery failed to work at once, 
and as the bystanders gave the push 
which started the ship down the ways, 
a thirteen year old at his elbow, shov
ing with all his might, said, I can 
push my pound, too! And it seemed 
that the spirit of the effort started the 
ship, for she slid safely down into the 
sea. The story of the rough rider 
blacksmith, who, although yearning 
for the battle, made horseshoes for 
the fighters, was used in the same con
nection. What the world needs is the 
roughrider blacksmith and the boy or 
woman who will push her pound or 
make horseshoes. The measure of 
success is not the acquiring of millions, 
but the feeling of service well done, 
said Colonel Church.
The beauty and appropriateness of 
the inscription above the curtain, Ici 
Linspiration Deploye Ses Ailes or 
translated Here inspiration spreads 
its wings was remarked on and trans
lated by the speaker. With a prophecy 
that the most militant thing in the 
world would soon be peace, Mr. 
Church deplored the great war. End
ing, he said that he felt sure that out 
of Carnegies thousands of works of 
loving kindness, the Institute was his 
favorite child.
Dean Leete next spoke with his usual 
keen wit. He remarked that since the 
last time he publicly addressed the 
students, a riot followed,, and a couple
of students spent some time in the 
lockup, he didnt like to speak again. 
But in a more serious vein, he said, 
When I see what some of the young 
men have done to come here, the sac
rifices they have made, I think all the 
nerve and backbone is not being dis
played on the battlefield. I hope your 
motto will be to make this year worth 
while in all ways.
. Dean Breed and Dean Connelley of 
M. M. C. S. and Applied In
plied Industries, respectively, spoke 
a few words of greeting. Miss 
Breed said in part: When we get
together I think were touched by the 
bigness of the Institute were in; and 
I think it will help each one of us to 
become bigger and to live up to the 
ideal set. Everyone knows who said 
We all love you, the faculty and their 
wives.
Coach Steffens voiced his disappoint
ment in the football showing to date, 
twenty-two out for the game from a 
three thousand enrollment. We 
ought to have at least one hundred, 
he said. What I w'ant is men wholl 
come out and be gentlemen. Men who 
treat an opponent fair and who are 
manly to the end. Thats my code.
The coach received a great ovation 
in the cheers and clapping which fol
lowed.
With an announcement of the new 
administration building opening, the 
forenoon session of the day closed to 
meet in the basement of the same new
building.

To the upper classmen this will only 
serve as a remindera reminder of the 
pleasures and benefits they have de
rived from one or several of the stu
dent activities in our college. To the 
entering class, we hope that it will be 
an introduction, and a cordial invita
tion for their co-operation throughout 
the year.
We are sure, that every Margaret 
Morrison girl will find something to 
interest her in at least one of our or
ganizations, and we trust that she will 
affiliate herself with this organization 
as soon as possible. For there is not 
one among us who does not need some 
place, besides the class room, to exer
cise her ability.
Our student activities furnish us a 
means of obtaining much pleasure 
from our own and others accomplish
ments in a most instructive and inter
esting way. So let us get together and 
work until we have them going as they 
should gothen, there will be plenty 
of time left to play with them.
bkn Adklnduc AttecugduenAlthough 
the athletic association is young, it 
started out last year with so much en
ergy that it is bound to succeed. A 
tennis tournament was conducted by 
the association during the first two 
weeks of last June with great success. 
Then, for the first time, a sweater 
bearing the Margaret Morrison mono
gram, was awarded to the winner, Miss 
Katharine D. Dermitt. The holding of 
a similar tournament will become one 
of the annual events of our college, 
and it is hoped that all girls interested 
will take part in the fun.
A series of inter-class basketball 
games will be scheduled later in the 
year. All members of the association 
are entitled to admission to these 
games. At the close of the basketball 
season, the Varsity team is chosen for 
the next year. This team is selected 
from the Senior, Junior and Sopho
more teams. Hockey teams will also 
be organized in the different classes, 
and competitive games played on the

is of interest to the entire student body 
and to many people in the city. It is 
the only charitable organization in the 
college, and its work is entirely phil
anthropic. The Guild through its wel
fare committee has already made itself 
acquainted with the Plebes.
This committee was appointed last 
year by the president of the Guild, 
Dorothy Skinner, and the work was 
arranged and successfully carried on 
by the chairman, Mary L. Williams. 
To each member of the committee was 
assigned a certain number of entering 
students with whom they correspond
ed during the summer, and in the case 
of Pittsburgh girls, visited them in 
their own homes.
The out of town girls were met at 
the stations, and taken to the school 
and dormitories. Members of the com
mittee were available on registration
days to show the new girls around the 
buildings, and to help them in every 
possible way.
Other committees which are doing 
active work for the Guild are as fol
lows:
Calendar Committee: Florence Hull, 
chairman.
Committee on Charities: Marguerite 
Menges, chairman.
bkn mlnn rlsaThe Glee Club 
needs no one to herald its approach 
to business. No sooner does it start, 
than is the fact known to everyone 
far and near. However, it furnishes a 
large share of the pleasures in the 
college.
The Margaret Morrison Glee Club 
does double work. It makes a repu
tation for itself; gives its own concert, 
etc., and it also contributes largely to 
the success of the Choral Club, and as 
a part of the Choral Club, appears in 
other concerts and entertainments in 
the school.
The election of officers for this year 
will take place, Thursday, October 1.
The girls in the Glee Club, under 
the direction of their president, Mary 
L. Williams, did excellent work last 
year, and it is hoped that every Plebe 
who feels that she can help in any way 
will come forward and join this organi
zation. Notices as to trials for voices, 
and times for rehearsals will be posted 
on the student bulletin board. All en
tering students are invited to attend.
bkn Dig&gduc rlsa  The work 
which was done by the Dramatic Club 
last year showed that we have among 
us a number of girls whose ability is 
not to be despised by anyonenot 
even the students of the Department 
of Dramatic Art.
The club gives two performances 
every year, one before the Christmas 
holidays, and another in the Spring. 
Last year, through the earnest efforts 
of the girls, and the wise guidance of 
their president, Anna M. Thomas, the 
work was exceptionally good. This 
year the club is older, and the girls are 
more experienced, so we are sure that 
they will give us something even bet
ter than they did last year.
The president of the club for this 
year is Marion D. Pichel. Miss Pichel 
took one of the leading parts in the 
Spring play, and has much dramatic 
and executive ability.
DImNIFIED HAZINm.
At a student body meeting held 
Thursday the matter of hazing the 
Plebes was discussed by the upper 
classmen. It was found that the sen
timent of the girls, in general, was to 
have very little hazing, and that the 
little which was necessary, should not 
amount to rowdyism.
Dignified Hazing said the Sopho
mores, and dignified hazing it has 
been. For the first time in several 
years there has been no mob of Sophs 
at Woodlawn and Forbes to catch and 
later terrorize the timid little Plebe.
The lovely French Twist has re
mained lovely, and Woodlawn avenue 
has not been strewn, this year, with 
hairpins, barrettes, rats, switches, nor 
even green mosquito netting.
There has been no lock-step parades 
among the girls. The Plebes have not 
been made to assemble in the streets 
and cheer rah, rah, rah, Sophs! nor 
have the effects of the stylish velvet 
bonnet been ruined by turning the 
pretty hicky to the back.
This years Plebes have much to be 
thankful for; the Sophomores much to 
be proud of. Who can deny that the 
Margaret Morrison Plebes made a very 
pleasing picture with beautiful green 
bows adorning either hair or arm 
green bows harmonizing in color and 
size.
FIRSb mENERAL ASSEMBLY.
The first assembly of both faculty 
and students of the Margaret Morri
son Carnegie School was called Thurs
day morning at nine oclock. A short 
address was made by Dean Breed in 
which she welcomed the new girls, and 
greeted the old girls in such a way 
as to make us glad to be here.
Following Dean Breeds request, 
brief addresses were made by the 
Heads of the Departments.
Announcements were made regard
ing the many changes in the school 
this year. Familiar Margaret Morri
son songs were sung, and cheers given 
for Carnegie and Plebes.

The one big pronounced hit of the 
last two London seasons has been Mr.

this city a year ago at which time lie 
also appeared in a play of the Orient, 
The Typhoon. Walker Whiteside, 
as is well known, is in the very front 
rank of the great character actors of 
the world and his delineation of the 
role of Mr. Wu should come as a 
revelation to his many friends and 
admirers.

AhLLIED INDUSbRIES.
Industries men read with concern
ed pleasure the editorial headed A 
Triple Alliance in the last issue of the 
Tartan. The closing sentence of the 
last paragraph bespoke an attitude 
which the three schools should heart
ily welcome. The time is ripe for the 
formation of a triple alliance. Such 
petty affairs as occasioned displeas
ures last year added greatly to the es
trangement of that feeling of unity 
without which the entire student body 
cannot exist in its proper element. 
In union there is strength, and the 
student body of Industries stretches 
out its hand for co-operation in ele
vating the Carnegie Institute of Tech
nology to a still higher plan of sin
cerity and equity.
The Science School is to be congrat
ulated upon its success in eliminating 
the prevalent hazing of its plebes. The 
Industries newcomers were treated 
rather uncivilly by the Sophs, and it is 
a lamentable fact that the same atti
tude was not accorded them as the 
fortunate Science freshmen received. 
Next year we trust the uncouth ac
tions of the schools who hazed their 
new friends will adopt the excellent 
precedent the Science School estab
lished this year. Honor to whom 
honor belongs.
The registration of Industries plebes 
exceeded thus far all records. The 
School is growing.
Several new instructors are in our 
ranks, and we hope they will find their 
faculty brothers the good men we have 
found them to be. Welcome to our 
ranks.
It might be well to remind the 
plebes that they will be given gladly, 
by the Sophomores, any information 
which will assist them in becoming 
familiar with school customs. In spir
it we are one.
Industries plebes may read with 
benefit the Carnegie Code published 
by Science Seniors in the last Tartan, 
regarding plebe customs. Newcomers 
must familiarize themselves with these 
rules, as they hold good for Applied 
Industries.
hRELIMINARY MEEbINm OF 
bHE SbUDENb ASSEMBLY.
A preliminary meeting of the Stu
dent Assembly of the School of Ap
plied Industries was held in Room 
104, Applied Industries Building, on 
Friday morning. The main purpose 
of the meeting was to acquaint the 
incoming class with the customs and 
workings of the Assembly. A printed 
copy of the constitution and by-laws 
was given each student, and the sev
eral features were thoroughly explain
ed. The classes were also advised to 
organize before the first regular meet
ing of the body on September 23rd.
President Murphy was introduced to 
the new men, and he in turn called 
upon F. L. Rownd, manager of the 
football team, and H. E. Gumbart, 
manager of the band, who spoke on
the activities represented by them, 
and urged the students to take part. 
Various members of the Upper class
es were also called upon. The sing
ing was in charge of R. K. Merker, 
with Schultz accompanying at the 
piano. Cheer-leader Randal put the 
new men through the various yells.

FOObBALL hROShErbS Ab 
rARNEmIE.
Last week marked the close of the 
first session of preliminary football 
practice. The first call for candidates 
was made on the 14th. About eleven 
men reported. With the opening of 
school on Thursday, the number grad
ually increased until now there are 
from thirty to forty men reporting 
daily on the field. The work for the 
most part was of a rudimentary nature 
and was confined almost entirely to 
catching and passing the ball, punting 
and running from the simplest forma
tions; in fact it was merely a harden
ing process with the object of getting 
the men into shape for the real work 
that is about to come. The opening 
of the; season is but a short time away, 
Waynesburg College drawing aside 
the curtain at Tech Field on October 
3rd. At this stage, the size of the 
squad is not what it ought to be. 
Everybody connected and concerned 
with the team is determined to make 
this a banner year, it is going to be a 
year that will open a new epoch in 
athletic history at Tech. We have al
ready established our prestige as a 
school by our scholastic standing; we 
have shown that we have a true and 
distinctive college spirit and now it is 
up to the student body to prove that 
they can furnish the material for a 
successful football team. The material 
is here if it can only be brought out 
and it is the duty of every true Tech 
man to see that it is out. Everyone 
with any football ability at all should 
report himself to the coach. He will 
determine your true worth and weed 
out if necessary. All this especially 
applies to the men just entering school; 
many a man, who had the least of 
ability at the start, has been developed 
by gradual training into a star athlete. 
In order to have a winning team, we 
agree that all must put their shoulder 
to the wheel and push their pound. 
It is worth your while both from a 
physical, moral and social standpoint. 
You will learn more about your fellow 
classmate by playing alongside of him 
on the field for one day than you can 
by knowing him for months in the 
class room. Come on, ye loyal Tech
men, show your spirit! Lets make the 
1914 team the best ever. We have 
everything to make it possible; we 
have a good coach, we have the back
ing of the Director and the faculty 
and above all we have the spirit.
An innovation will be made in more 
than one way this year. Arrangements 
have been made for a training house 
and Manager Frank Rownd has closed 
the deal whereby the dwelling at 1227 
Whitman street will be occupied after 
October 1st by Carnegies football 
warriors. This is a big step in the 
development of our athletics, as it is 
expected that the training house will 
be operated the whole year through 
for all the teams. We have Director 
Hamerschlag and Mr. McCulloch to 
thank for this convenience as they 
have worked untiringly to make it a 
possibility. Further information re
garding the regulation and manage
ment of the house will be published 
later as plans have not yet been defi
nitely laid. We will have a better 
time of the day to practice. The facul
ty ruling whereby all classes are dis
missed at 4:30 works a distinct advan
tage. The best licks can be put in 
when it is daylight and not in the dusk 
of evening. In former years the men 
have had scrimmage practise almost 
invariably after dark. The coach 
urges all men to report for practise 
promptly at 4:30 in order that this 
condition will be done away with as 
much as possible. Coach Steffens also 
wishes to inform all candidates that he 
will be on the field at 3 oclock every
day, ready to give the fellows any 
special instructions that they desire.
There are quite a few of the old men 
back on the field this year, Captain 
McCaughey, Balsinger, Welch, Lauer, 
Kessner, Krieder, McDonald, H. Hellstrom, Oeffinger, Fletcher, Boileau, 
Parke and last but not least, Captain 
Benny of the Scrubs. All the men 
seem to be in good shape and will make 
a strong bid for their old place on the 
team. Captain Benny says he ex
pects to lead his men on to at least 
one victory over the Varsity. Go to 
it, old top, were for you. We have 
lost from last years team ex-Capt. 
Clair, Burke, Fulmer, and Oakes. Clair 
will be missed most, and his place in 
the line will be hard to fill. His strong 
consistent play was a feature of many 
a game in his three years on the team. 
His punting last year was good, and 
in fact there were very few teams that 
appeared here that had a booter up to 
his standard. We hope we are able to 
unearth a man to fill his shoes, al
though it appears to be a decidedly 
difficult job. The most promising new 
men that have appeared on the horizon 
and of whom we expect much are 
Crawford, Holzworth, McDowell, Kel
ly, and Mitchell. Crawford comes 
from Kiski with a big prep school

yards with it, and then passed it on 
again. Aside from being exciting this 
contest disclosed the fact that we have 
some very good track material in the 
incoming class which should gladden 
Coach Dulls heart. We might add in 
passing that the Sophs won this con
test in a hands down manner as 
Sophs always do in song and story.
Field hockey came next and was 
like ordinary ice hockey excepting that 
more men took part. The Sophs won 
this also. Field hockey is a new con
test being used this year for the first 
time, and proved to be an admirable 
kind of a game for such an occasion. 
Besides being interesting to the spec
tators it gives the players a chance to 
hit an opposing player in case they 
miss the ball at which they are hitting. 
This, of course, is quite a consolation.
Further future athletic material 
loomed up in the Indian Ball game. It 
proved to the students that we have 
some Plebes who are basket ball stars 
and who may prove to be valuable as
sets to the team this winter. Indian 
Ball is almost the same as English 
football, only the ball is carried down 
the field by passing it from man to 
man instead of kicking it. The Plebes 
won this game.
The contests were ended by the tug 
of war, which the Sophs won. There 
were supposed to be only seventy-five 
men on a side, but the Plebes claim that 
they lost simply because the Sophs 
had several hundred men in line. How
ever, since the fall re-exams there are 
not that many men in school so their 
alibi dont go.
The push ball contest which had 
been looked forward to with much 
interest was called off as the ball got 
punctured by rolling it against the 
back stop, from' which a nail protruded, 
and as the law of Impenetrability of 
Matter has not been repealed by the 
faculty there was nothing else for it 
to do, but to puncture said ball. The 
final score was Sophs 23, Plebes 10.

FALL FESTIVAL GREAT SUCCESS

added the cheers of the students as 
they formed in a large red C, with 
the cheer leaders in the centre. The 
fun closed with the singing of Amici 
by the entire assemblage.
The Plebes were afterwards the 
guests of the Sophs at a smoker in the 
field house. With the help of smokes 
and eats and to the tune of various 
songs in more or less close harmony 
everyone mixed, and the Plebes were 
made to feel that they were really part 
of the institution.
Too much credit cannot be given to 
Prof. Stevens, head of the Department 
of Dramatic Arts, his assistant, Prof. 
Ross, and to the various committees 
and participants in the festival. The 
time of preparation was short, which 
made the work all the harded and 
the degree of success the more com, 
mendable. Every one can have the 
satisfaction of feeling that his efforts 
resulted in a most successful and cred
itable production and that they were 
highly appreciated by the large and 
enthusiastic audience.

record, having played a Varsity tackle 
there for three years. He is a large, 
husky chap, full of pepper and fighting 
spirit and should prove a valuable ac
quisition to the squad. Holzworth is 
a former Rayen High School star. He 
is a very big man, standing about six 
foot three and weighing close to the 
double century mark. He is strong 
and fast and should make an excellent 
bid for ex-Capt. Clairs position. Mc
Dowell, from Parnassus High, has 
been playing a very creditable game at 
quarter and is handling the team1 like 
a veteran. He looks good and should 
come up to the standard set by his old 
townsman, John Park. Kelly and 
Mitchell have been doing good work, 
and have the earmarks of first string 
men. There are quite a few other 
men who are promising, but on account 
of the lack of real practice we have 
been unable to get a proper line on 
them.

rAMh BROKEN FOR SbARb OF 
SrHOOL.
Ssivnceit Bgck de ruvulu.gduen.
By Special Correspondent to The 
Tartan.
Wednesday, September 16th, was a 
busy day at Camp Louise Carnegie. 
The dawn of a cloudless day started 
a round of work which never ended 
until the camp was ready for the win
ter, when the 3:41 train pulled out in 
the afternoon. FNerybody worked, 
and the sun that rose on a small city 
of tents went down on a barren field, 
cleaned of every scrap or debris of 
camping. All the tents were taken 
down just after dinner, and stored, 
with the blankets and cots, in the infore leaving and there was many copy
ing bees. The nights never seemed 
long enough and when the rising bell 
rang fewer responded each morning, 
until the breakfast gong was the sig
nal which got most out of their blank
ets.
Late in the middle of one night, the 
signal bell rang out strongly. Loung
ers at the camp fire turned to look; 
but nobody was near the clanging bell 
post. Soon Dr. Day stuck his head out 
of the tent and saw the mystic sight. 
When he had collected his thoughts 
he strode over to the post, reached up, 
and the clamor stopped. Next morn
ing a long thread was found leading 
over to the Palace. Another mystic 
incident occurred the last night in 
camp. Strange scratchings on the
SCENE AT CAMP LOUISE CARNEGIE
strument house; while a large auto 
truck loaded to capacity took all the 
surveying paraphernalia back to 
school, except perhaps the mercurial 
barometer which rode strapped to 
Professor Stantons back.
But the crowd that rode back to 
Pittsburgh were all graduate survey
ors, who had driven enough stakes in 
the farm property to furnish kindling 
wood for a winter. The Senior Civils had finished the surveying of the 
toughest student railroad in the mem
ory of Professor Stanton, and came 
back with a coat of sunburn and a dose 
of ivy poison which vied with each 
other in making their possessors mis
erable.
The last week of camp was a busy 
one. All notebooks had to be in bebacks and sides of the tent kept sev
eral fearful ones awake all night with 
their hands on their shoes.
One of the results of breaking camp 
was the destruction of as fine a set of 
mustaches as ever grew. The camp 
rule that nobody shave his upper lip 
surely gave the Freeport barber'a busy 
time at the end. Some of the brave 
ones took a shave in the ice water on 
tap, or rather a hacking. Pittsburgh 
and hot water were synonyms then.
Despite the hardships, real or fan 
cied, everyone enjoyed their stay at 
camp, and all feel grateful to Director 
Hamerschlag, Dr. Day, Professor 
Stanton, and the corps of teachers who 
made this mixture of pleasure and 
profit possible.

The name of another former Car

list of mortally wounded. The latest 
victim is David A. Shirk, whose mar
riage to Miss Florence Hulda Shep
herd, of Scranton, Pennsylvania, oc
curred 011 Wednesday, September six
teenth. Until a year ago, Shirk was a 
member of the 1915 electrical engi
neering class of the Science School. 
At that time, he withdrew from school, 
to take a trip around the world. Since 
his return, he has been in the employ 
of the Westinghouse Lamp Company 
of New York.
rAMhUS rURIOSIbIES.
The students returning to school 
this fall have found many new addi
tions to our campus and buildings. The 
grading has gone on rapidly so that 
the lawns around the Science and De
sign Schools are as fresh and green 
as the plebe who tried to find Prof. 
Snyder in the Maggie Murphie School. 
Old Beanery, so. beloved by the medi
cal profession which experienced dur
ing the formers existence a boom 
seldom equalled in the worlds his
tory, has gone we know not where, 
though rumor has it the hydraulics 
lab pulled it down hill.
The addition to the Margaret Morri
son School is under way and should 
be completed in a month or two. The 
style of architecture is the same as 
that prevailing throughout the campus 
being of straw colored brick, with tile 
trimmings. A manicurists and hair
dressers parlors are to be located on 
the first floor, as well as a marriage 
license bureau. A dance hall will oc
cupy the second floor. There is to be 
a class room somewhere on the third 
floor, and tennis courts on the roof. 
A dummy waiter has also been in

DR. mRONDAHL BArK FROM 
bHE FRONb.
After a six months leave of absence, 
Dr. Grondahl has returned from 
abroad to resume his work in the phys
ics department of the School of Ap
plied Science. In common with a 
number of other professors who were 
traveling in Europe this summer, Dr. 
Grondahls homeward journey was de
layed a little by the outbreak of the 
war.
When war was declared at the be
ginning of August, Dr. Grondahl and 
his wife were in the northern part of 
Norway near Hammerfest. Upon the 
advice of the American consul, they 
started southward for Kristiana as 
soon as possible. From there, they 
crossed into Germany and reached 
Berlin on August twentieth. They 
experienced little difficulty in travel
ing, although, as might have been ex
pected, the accommodations were poor 
and the transportation very slow. Dr. 
Grondahl seemed impressed with the 
courteous treatment he received at 
the hands of the Germans. The day 
in Berlin, he said, the Kaisers sub
jects were more friendly than usual 
because Japan had just declared war 
on Germany and the people of the lat
ter nation considered it a foregone con
clusion that America would attack 
Japan. Happily they were mistaken.
From Berlin, where they remained 
but a few hours, Dr. and Mrs. Gron
dahl returned to Kristiana. They 
stayed there ten days before embark
ing as third class passengers on the 
Cunard liner, Campania, for Liverpool. 
While crossing the North Sea, their 
boat was halted by a British fleet of 
fourteen battleships and boarded by 
several officers who examined all of 
the passengers to ascertain their na
tionality. They then proceeded to Liv
erpool without further molestation. In 
the latter city, Dr. Grondahl was able 
to secure second class passage on an
other ship, so that the voyage across 
the Atlantic was comparatively com
fortable. Their vessel was not fol
lowed out into the ocean, but the port 
holes were kept covered and lights had 
to be turned out at an early hour, even 
after entering the St. Lawrence Gulf.
Dr. and Mrs. Grondahl arrived in 
Pittsburgh about a week ago, appar
ently none the worse for their experi
ences in the war zone. The former 
went abroad primarily for the purpose 
of studying, and the students in his 
class, who will receive the benefit of 
his instructions, should consider them
selves very fortunate.

At the close of the 1914 baseball sea
son. the Varsity men met to elect a 
leader for the following year. J. C. 
Humphries, a Senior in the Design 
School, was selected as cap
tain. Humphries has been on the 
team two years. In 1911 he played 
the outfield for Carnegie; in 1912 and
1913 he was unable to compete for a 
place on the team on account of illness. 
Last year he covered first base, playBgnkt
