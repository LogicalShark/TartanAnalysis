ALLEGHENY WINS MEET. 
Records Fall.
Allegheny Colleges track team won 
the dual meet with Carnegie held on 
Leeds Field, Saturday, May 17, by 
monopolizing the dashes and the 
weight eventSj and taking places in 
almost all of the other events. The 
final score in points was 74-57.
The track was rather heavy, and 
the day was far from ideal, but the 
races were close and all of the marks 
set were good. Haselton verified all 
predictions by breaking the Western 
Pennsylvania record for two miles. 
In the Pitt-Lafayette meet two weeks 
ago, a Lafayette man traveled the 
distance in 10:29, but the real record 
was 11:02, as established in 1911 by 
ex-Capt. Wait. Haselton abandoned 
his competitors and finished the dis
tance in 10:26 1-5. Simpson ran a 
good race and finished second in time 
close to eleven minutes.
Doran, of Allegheny, furnished sen
sations in the dashes. He ran the 
100-yard dash in 10 1-5 seconds, equal
ing the record for the track, and then 
traveled 220 yards in 23 seconds. The 
100-yard race was the closest of the 
day. Doran, Thomas and Perley, of 
Allegheny, and Capt. Crawford, fin
ished in a bunch with less than a yard 
between the first and the last man. 
fChuck had just finished the high 
hurdles in fast time; otherwise he 
would have placed.
The one-mile race also offered 
thrills to the small crowd that en
joyed the meet. Haselton and Met
calf fought it out over the entire dis
tance, but the little Carnegie runner 
drew aw^ay on the final half lap and 
won by twenty feet.
Chuck Dotterer, the larger of the 
two Allegheny brothers, was the star 
point-winner of the meet. He out
classed all of the entrants in the 
weight events, taking first in the shotput and in the discus throw and sec
ond place in the hammer throw. He 
put the shot past the 41-foot mark, 
and hurled the discus 118^4 feet. Clair 
finished second in the latter event, 
breaking the school record with a 
throw of 108 feet. The big football 
captain captured first place in the 
hammer throw, but failed to qualify 
in the shot-put.
Referee Pop Golden, of Penn. 
State, was called upon to render an 
unusual decision in awarding points 
for the pole vault. Wright, of Car
negie, and Wells of Allegheny, had 
the event to themselves when the 
bar reached 10 feet 6 inches. Wright 
balked twice, failed once, then cleared

MR. JULIAN KENNEDY AD
DRESSES FEDERATED EN
GINEERS SOCIETY.
Speaks on Efficiency.
Those who were present at the 
meeting of the Federated Engineers 
Society last Friday evening, were 
treated to a very interesting, informal 
address by Mr. Julian Kennedy, in 
addition to the usual refreshments. 
Mr. Julian Kennedy, the well-known 
engineer of this city, spoke in his 
characteristic manner on the subject 
of Efficiency of Humanity in the 
Mass. He interspersed his remarks 
with a sarcasm that gained for him 
the approval and earnest attention of 
his audience.
Mr. Kennedy enumerated  chiefly 
the. many ways in which energy is 
uselessly expended in this country. 
He declared that the lack of efficiency 
is caused by the large number of non
producers and by the excessive num
bers engaged in a single production. 
He cited as an example, the medical 
profession which contains three times 
as many physicians as there should 
be. He mentioned among others the 
system of transportation and the sys
tem of the law courts as productive 
of great waste, not only of money, 
but also of time. Every waste, said 
the speaker, indirectly causes an in
crease in the living expenses of each 
one of us. The natural resources in 
America are so good that if every 
man worked four hours a day, we 
should all be able to live comfort
ably.
The tendency in this country, Mr. 
Kennedy believes, is too much toward 
the individual end not enough toward

TWO TENNIS MATCHES THIS 
WEEK.
Tech Versus Penn State Today.
The tennis team will be kept very 
active during the coming week, two 
matches on the schedule. This after
noon Tech will cross racquets with 
Penn State on the University Club 
courts; while on Saturday, the team 
will go to Grove City in the endeavor 
to even matters with that school for 
the defeat suffered at its hands a 
short time ago. With the advantage 
of more practice, Tech should show 
quite an improvement and play bet
ter tennis than in the opening match, 
when in all justice to the players, it 
must be admitted they did not dis
play their true form. Better results 
are hoped for against both Penn State 
and Grove City.
ARRANGEMENTS FOR SCHOOL 
PICNIC. 
A Day of Relaxation and Enjoyment 
Will Be Provided.
As many of the Alumni, Fac
ulty, and their wives and of the 
students as can, are urged to give
this coming Saturday over to a day of 
pleasure and attend the annual school 
picnic at Camp Louise Carnegie. A 
program has been provided that insures 
a good time for all so that a spring day 
spent up the river will certainly be en
joyed by everyone and remain a pleas
ant reminiscence of the year.
The special train leaves Union Station 
at 10:20 A.M., and East Liberty at 10:30. 
The round trip fare from the former is 
85c and from the latter, 75c. A later 
train leaves the Union Station at 10:30 
and East Liberty at 10:41. Tickets may 
be secured at the offices of the various 
deans, the Burson, or the Secretary. 
The picnic will be held rain or shine as, 
should the weather prove inclement, the 
mansion house will provide ample room.
Each person is expected to bring his 
or her own luncheon. Those wishing 
to purchase some may do so by notifying 
Mr. Grant at the Beanery and he will 
furnish them at the camp. Coffee and 
lemonade will be provided on the 
grounds.
After lunch a program of athletic 
events for both sexes will be run off in 
charge of Mr. McCulloch, for which 
prizes will be awarded. There will also 
be good games such as quoits, croquet, 
and baseball. Facilities for rowing and 
swimming will be provided although 
each must bring his own suit. A rifle 
range and material for other similar 
sports will be furnished.
The farm menagerie will also be on 
view. This consists of pigs of all sizes, 
the herd of prize sheep, turkey goblins, 
ducks, and other ferocious animals too 
numerous to mention. The school agriContinued on Page 2.
STATE WINS CLOSE GAME.
ANNOUNCEMENT.
Last week the brief announcement 
was made that the date of Com
mencement had been changed from 
June 20th to June 17th. This shift
ing forward of the date previously 
set made necessary the shifting of 
the plans made for Commencement 
week but, taken all around, the only 
regret is that it wTas not set for the 
13th. The Seniors want to graduate 
on Friday the 13th, 1913, believing 
that by doing this their troubles 
would be solved. Since that was not 
deemed possible, all small favors are 
thankfully received.
Fast Contest Lost Early in Day.
Penn States strong nine took an 
interesting game from the Varsity last 
Saturday at State College by the score 
of 3 to 1. They won out by superior 
playing in the pinches. Hoerr pitched 
a great game after the third inning, 
but his wildness and the teams un
usually poor support lost the game 
in the second and third. Liebert al
lowed more hits, but his team backed 
him up well and kept the scoring 
dowrn.
Gearhart put up a great game in the 
field accepting eight difficult chances, 
with but one slip-up. Vail and Kirk 
also did some speedy work in the 
outfield.
Hall started the game by sending 
a grounder to Hittner, brother of the 
former Tech star, who threw him out 
at first. Kirks bunt was fumbled by 
Liebert, and he was safe. Vail sac
rificed to Hittner, and Lobert went 
out by the same route.
Millers grounder was handled by 
Brine in time to catch the runner at 
first. Crawford struck out, and Hen
derson drew a base on balls. He stole 
second, but was left there, as Mason 
flied to Vail.
In the second, Lain struck out and 
Gearhart was thrown out by Liebert. 
Moorhead got on base on a single, 
but was caught off the bag by a throw 
from Liebert to Mason. State started 
their scoring in this inning. Hittner 
fanned, but Keller knocked out a 
three-bagger. He scored while McKibben took third on Moorheads 
failure to reach Lains throw'. Vogt 
singled, scoring McKibben, but he 
was caught off first by Lains peg. 
Liebert ended by hitting to Gearhart, 
who threw to Moorhead.
Brine opened the third by singling. 
Hoerr also singled, but Brine was 
caught trying to reach third. Hoerr 
stole second and scored when Keller 
threw wild to catch Hall at first. Hall 
also stole second, but was left there, 
as Kirk and Vail went down, Hitt
ner to Mason. State scored the last 
run in their half of the third on an 
error and a two-base hit. Brine and

THE SPRING FESTIVAL.
A Spring Festival is to be held on 
the campus on the evening of May 
28th. This will be the first event 
of its kind we have ever held, and 
it should receive the support of all 
members of the student body. The 
committee having the affair in charge 
is working hard to make it a suc
cess, but they can not do it unless 
thej- receive the support of the stu
dents. If the holding of such an 
event on the campus proves popular, 
the custom will probably be contin
ued in years to came. It is particu
larly important, therefore, that sup
port be given to this first effort. Re
member the date and be there.
Elsewhere in this issue will be found a 
letter from the Seannachie Society, an 
aftermath of the unfortunate happening 
in connecting with an election of a Car
negie team manager. The article quoted 
shows pretty clearly the attitude of the 
fraternity accused of playing fraternity 
politics and it behooves every student 
to read it carefully and gather its mean, 
ing. The Athletic Association is sup
posed to be run for the benefit of the 
entire student-body and its elected officers 
should bave this constantly in mind. The 
bringing up of this incident again is added 
proof of the value to the student-body
of the Seannachie Society in looking after 
the interests of the whole against the 
interests of a group.
CORRESPONDENCE
[The Editors of the Tartan are pleased 
at all times to receive communications 
from any member of the Faculty or stu
dent-body upon subjects of timely inter
est. Such articles as are deemed of suf
ficient interest will be published at the 
first opportunity. Anonymous communi
cations cannot be considered, but the 
names of correspondents will be withheld 
when so desired.]
To the Editor of The Tartan.
Dear Sir:The following extract 
from The Pi Crust of Theta Xi has 
been brought to the attention of this 
society. As the Seannachie and the 
student body in general are directly 
concerned in this matter, we ask that 
the article be put before the students 
through your columns. Striving to 
make a hit with the student body, 
the Seannachie Club, a honorary in
stitution in our school, composed of 
C men and others generally active 
about Tech. protested against the 
election of Bro. Parry as Track Man
ager to succeed Bro. Engstrom. The 
protest was based on the grounds that 
the election was not advertised 
enough previously. To humor the 
Club, the Board of Control, an elected 
committee from the student body, 
passed a motion calling for the resig
nation of Cap and a new election 
two weeks from that date. On the 
date set, the Board, to prove it knew 
what it was doing in the first place, 
re-elected Bro. Parry, against four 
other men. Parry had but one op
posing vote.
We regret. Mr. Editor, the neces
sity of reopening the case alluded to, 
but desire to protest against the at
titude assumed by the fraternity in 
question. In the face of the protesta
tions of Theta Xi members that fra
ternity politics played no part in the 
matter, the above article is a direct 
insult, not only to the Seannachie, 
but to the entire student body.
The motives ascribed to this so
ciety are only ridiculous, but the idea 
expressed of the subservience of the 
Athletic Board of Control to the 
wishes of one fraternity is a matter 
that deserves the attention of every 
student, whose servant the Board of 
Control should be.

The Seannachie.

humanity in general. In the speak
er's opinion, a great improvement 
could be accomplished if each person 
would contribute to public needs, onetenth of the energy given to his pri
vate vocation. The large number of 
criminals and of unemployed persons, 
and the conditions brought about by 
poverty should give the people cause 
for serious thought. All of these 
causes help to decrease the efficiency 
of humanity in the mass.
Mr. Kennedy is hopeful, however. 
He believes that America is slowly 
beginning to learn, and he expects 
to see the time when not one-half of 
the people will be non-producers and 
not one-fourth will be incompetents.

one must forget the coal mine of in

The numerous lovely walks and shady 
retreats will afford ample enjoyment to 
those so inclined. No one should neglect 
to visit the hill top from whence a mag

DEAN LEETE SPEAKS IN 
DETROIT.
Dean Leete went to Detroit Mon
day. where he delivered an ad
dress on Industrial Education, be
fore the National Association of 
Manufacturers, Wednesday. This 
Association has had committees in
vestigating the subject of industrial 
education for the past five years, and 
has had made to it by its committees 
some of the most complete reports 
on the subject yet prepared. The 
convention began Monday and closed 
with the annual banquet Thursday 
night.
The Class of 1915, Night Science, 
held their annual banquet at the 
Hotel Henry on the evening of May 
13th. The old saying, Its getting 
better and better every minute, might 
again be truthfully applied, for al
though this class has held a banquet 
or smoker each school month, the 
final banquet excelled all others in 
its eats, its music furnished by the 
Nossokoff Orchestra, and in making 
everybody happy.
Once things got started by the 
lively tunes of the orchestra, we were 
off, and during the disappearance of 
the foodstuffs the room was kept in 
a continual state of laughter and some 
new stories were actually told.
The committee in charge had surely 
arranged an interesting program and 
the talks by the fellow members 
were well prepared and delivered in 
a manner bound to hold the attention 
of all throughout.
The members of the Class were 
more than overjoyed to have with 
their classmates, who through change 
of residence or poor health have 
withdrawn from the school. Through 
these columns we desire to announce 
to all friends, Come always for Our 
strong band must neer be broken.

The prize winners of the Thistle 
Art Contest were Miss Grace Gar

by the members of the Design School 
Faculty and Miss Garland was 
awarded first prize of six dollars on 
her unique Frontispiece. Mr. Wood

lars on his drawing of the January 
Heading for the Calendar. The This
tle Board takes this opportunity to 
thank the students of the Design 
School for their active interest in the 
contest, and to compliment them on 
the excellence of the work presented.

PRACTICAL CARPENTRY 
IN INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL.
One of the features of the work 
in the Building Construction Course 
of the Industries School during the 
present semester was the construction 
of a frame bungalow 25x27 feet in 
the Carpentry Department. Brick 
piers were built on the shop floors 
and the structure framed complete, 
the sills, studding, joists, floor, ceiling 
and rafters being mortised and erected 
in place. The door and window 
frames were finished as were the in
side doors. The building is one story 
high and contains a large living room, 
bedroom, bath, and kitchen. Across 
the entire front is a 9-foot porch.
The structure has been taken down 
and shipped to Garvers Ferry, from 
where it was hauled to its last rest
ing place at Camp Carnegie, and 
under the direction of Mr. R. M. 
Young, Instructor in Carpentry, is 
being assembled and rebuilt by the 
students in the Carpentry course.
Plans are under way to erect sev
eral bungalows similar to the above 
during the summer, and when erected 
will give that particular site at Camp 
Carnegie the appearance of a little 
hamlet. The bungalows being erect
ed on the slope of the hill, face the 
river and overlook the Mansion and 
its environs, giving a very desirable 
place to live during the summer 
months.
On the day of the picnic at the 
Camp there will be an opportunity to 
see the progress of the work.

the bar, while Wells tried unsuccess
fully three times. Wright continued 
to vault for a record and cleared 11 
feet. A protest was carried to the 
referee, and after a discussion of the 
rules by the officials,, in which two 
different interpretations were pre
sented, Mr. Golden decided that the 
event was a tie between the two men. 
The point raised is an interesting one, 
and will be presented to the A. A. 
U. rules committee for a clearer state
ment of the regulations applying to 
such cases.
Murphy, King and Wright gather
ed in the nine points awarded for the 
high jump by tying for first place, 
with the bar at 5 feet 6 inches. King 
sprained his ankle on the last jump, 
and the tie was not broken.
The meet was hotly contested un
til the closing events, then Allegheny 
drew ahead. Carnegie opened by 
taking eight points in the two-mile 
race. Crawford added five points by 
winning the 120-yard hurdles, then 
Allegheny took the lead by 14-13, 
when they won the nine points for 
the 100-yard dash. This lead was in
creased three points by the 440-yard 
run, then Carnegie shut out the visi
tors in the high jump, and the score 
stood 25-20. Allegheny came back 
by taking three places in the shotput. The one-mile run and the 220- 
yard hurdles tied the points at 36 
for each school. In the next six
events Allegheny slowly drew away, 
and the relay race, uncontested, gave 
the final standing of 74-57.

4THE TARTAN
M. M. C. S. DRAMATICS.STATE WINS CLOSE GAME
Anyone who was in the Margaret 
Morrison Carnegie School Gymnasium 
on Friday evening, May 16, or on Sat
urday afternoon, May 17, can tell you 
that two of the best performances that 
were ever performed in M. M. C. S. 
took place at that time.
The first play, Yeats "Land of 
Hearts Desire, was an extremely dif
ficult play to produce and the girls 
who took the parts deserve special con
gratulations for the most admirable 
way that each one interpreted her part. 
Anne Thomas, as the bride, could not 
have been better. She looked the part 
as well as acted it. She also knew 
enough not to overdo, but rather to 
do just enough. Nell Kern, as the 
fairy, was a dainty and as fairy-like 
as any real fairy. Florence Hull, as 
the old father, was typical. Surely no 
one could have done it better. Ida 
Kaster, and Leah White also handled 
their parts quite well.
The second play, Lady Gregorys 
Spreading the News, was, most ap
propriately, the exact opposite of the 
first. It was a roaring farce, and was 
most welcomely received by the audi
ence, at least one would suppose so, 
from the peals of laughter which con
tinued to peal forth, from the rise of 
the curtain till its fall. Katherine Saw
yer almost brought down the house 
with her rendering of the old apple 
womans part. Mary Roberts, as Bart
ley Fallon, the most unfortunate of 
men, deserves most generous praise, 
for in her gloomy pessimistic part she 
was the exact opposite of our bright 
and fun-loving Mary. Bartleys wife, 
which part was taken by Mary Wentzel. was as good as her husband, and 
her righteous indignation and quick 
responses brought much applause from 
the audience. Estelle Brodhead and 
Georgia Clarke were typical Irish gos
sips. Their costumes were most unique 
to say the least, and there was abso
lutely no mistaking their nationalities. 
Jack Smith's part, acted by Isabel Haag, 
was probably one of the most typical 
Irish in the whole cast. We wonder at 
Izzys agility and perfect at home
ness, in lighting and handling her 
pipe. We raise our eyebrow^ Oh! 
ever so slightly. The magistrate, the 
policeman, the two town loafers, were 
all very fine in their parts. The whole 
play was full of quaint and quick re
torts, and the charm of none of these 
was taken away by the acting. The 
Dramatic Club is most thankful to Mr. 
Geoghegan, Mrs. Vermorcken and Miss 
Ernst for their part in making the pro
duction its best. Mr. Goeghegans pa
tience is positively phenomenal, as well 
as his ideas and his talent. The Dra
matic Club feels that it can never really 
thank him for what he has done. The 
Club also wishes to thank Miss Pat
ton, Mr. Withers, Mr. Eklund, and Mr. 
Sollom for their help in getting up the 
scenery.
Continued from page 1.
There will be eats on the even
ing of the 28th, together with a fine 
entertainment by the Musical and 
Dramatic Societies of the womens 
and mens schools. ITS FREE TO

TECH AT GROVE CITY.
No Home Games Till June 7.
After the good showing made 
against State, Tech bids fair to sur
pass its record of last year, when it 
won ten out of sixteen games. The 
team will not play at home again 
until June 7. If it continues at its 
present gait, it should return with an 
increased number of victories to its 
credit. On Saturday, the second game 
with Grove City will be played on 
the latters grounds. The first strug
gle was a slugging match, with Tech 
victorious. This one, however, should 
be quite different from the Grove 
City standpoint, for Techs pitchers 
are all going well. Hines or Urquhart will probably start the game, and 
either of them, with proper support, 
should be able to win.
In the absence of the Varsity, the 
Scrub team will furnish the attrac
tion on Leeds Field, Saturday after
noon, when they meet Braddock High 
School. The players on the second 
team are worthy of a great deal of 
credit. It is through their efforts that 
the first team is strengthened. Dough
erty or Fagan will be on the firing 
line for Tech.

Defeat Duquesne II by Large Score.
Carnegie Tech II took sweet re
venge for the two games lost by the 
Varsity by defeating the Duquesne 
University second team 16 to 1. The 
game was played Saturday, May 17, on 
Duquesnes home field.
The Tartan followers started a reg
ular swat-fest in the first inning, and, 
by following it through, gathered 19 
hits from Mcllvaines delivery. Frey 
pitched a steady game, and kept the 
four hits well scattered. He pitched 
himself out of the few holes that he 
got into, and several times struck out 
dangerous men.
Duquesnes only run came in the 
fourth inning. Cleary was given a 
base on balls and stole second and 
third bases. Szepe singled at the 
right time, scoring Cleary. At only 
two other times were men past sec
ond base, and Frey immediately tight
ened up.
Kreider stopped a possible home run 
by a leaping catch of a hard drive 
that was traveling to the fence.
Duquesne plays a return game here 
on May 31.

C. M. E. S. MEETING.
At 7:45 Friday evening, May 16th, 
the Mechanical Engineering Society 
held a short business- meeting, at 
which the constitution was revised.
There were necessary changes made 
in order to have the application for 
affiliation as a student branch of the 
A. S. M. E. considered.
The Society hopes to have its ap
plication granted, as the outlook is 
very favorable.
The A. S. M. E. at present has stu
dent branches in most of the promi
nent engineering schools in the coun
try. It would be a great advantage to 
the local society to become a student 
branch.
MUS MUSCULAS.
Why Is It When It Spins?
In reply to a query in last weeks 
Tartan as to certain phenomena re
lating to the behaviour of mice, we 
quote Professor Huxley:
These little creatures will often, 
while running rapidly, hoist them
selves upon the ends of their tails, 
and spin around much after the man
ner of tops. In observing the ex
traordinary antics of a group of these 
muscoid rodents, the most curious 
and notable feature isthe higher 
the fewer.
CRUCIBLE CLUB.
On Friday evening, May 23, the Cruci
ble Club will hold their final meeting 
of the year. Mr. Ralston, a graduate 
engineer, of Colorado State, and now 
connected with the government in the 
local station of the Bureau of Mines, 
will talk. His subject will be, Open 
Metallurgical Problems in Colorado. 
Officers for the ensuing year will also 
be elected. Those plebes interested in 
the chemical, metallurgical, or mining 
engineering courses are especially in
vited to attend.

from Me., N. H., Mass., and Conn. Dr. 
Harris (Amherst) was present and 
spoke of the present standing of Tech. 
and the opportunities for students from 
New England.
Many stories were told when the 
smokes were passed around. Several 
gave their reasons for coming here.
Fogg of Me., suggested that an or
ganization be formed. Butler of Conn., 
took the chair and spoke in favor of 
this and also told of Techs, reputation. 
A unanimous vote was made to organ
ize.

dent. An executive committee was 
elected as follows: L. C. Fogg, chair
man; L. E. Mason, Secretary; Dr. Har
ris, advisory member; J. P. Tumpane,
G. C. Robbins, Jo. Gelman. This com
mittee will form a plan for formal or

The objects of this club are to place 
New England students in closer touch 
with Tech. and cultivate inter-school 
spirit with Yankee, hospitality.
It" was brought out that many fellows 
are planning on entering in the future 
from New England. Many interesting
