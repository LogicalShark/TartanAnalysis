Techs Football in 1910?
The writer has been requested to express his opin
ions regarding the prospects of Carnegie Techs foot
ball team for next season.
To view the possibilities, one must look back on 
the work done and results accomplished during the 
last ten weeks, and figure on an equal improvement 
next fall. When the season opened with the first 
game, on October 2nd last, the team contained but 
two of last years team, and but one of these played 
the same position. Marshal was found at his old 
position of right tackle. Captain Hittner, the other 
old player, it was found necessary to move from 
quarter, where he had always played, to the position 
of right-halfentirely a new place for him. A Fresh
man, or Plebe, Mandeville, was used at quarter for 
two games until Coldren a more experienced player, 
replaced him. A fullback was developed in Robin
son, who previously had played a center, although 
he had been out of the game for over a year. Left 
half was filled by another Plebe, Flick, coming di
rectly from a preparatory school. Left end also has 
been entrusted to a Plebe, Morris, who previously 
has been playing a guard, or tackle. Right End 
Dolin again is a man new to Tech football. Left 
Tackle Crawford and Right Guard Kime were filled 
in from last years scrub team. Left Guard Zeringer 
and Center Lloyd were men entirely unknown to 
Tech football and played college ball for the first
time. Two substitutes, Mccorkle and Hatcher, had 
played parts of some games with the team the year 
previous.
The undertaking of making a high-class team out 
of this inexperienced material proved successful. 
The foundation was laid on grit and backbone. That 
this foundation was a good one has been shown by 
the teams well-known ability to play a fast, aggres
sive game and keep it up throughout the playing 
period. The record of five straight games with not 
one second of time taken out for an injury or argu
ment with an official shows to how great an extent 
these men had themselves in hand. Up to the time 
of this writing not one member of the team has been 
removed from he game because of an injury, nor has 
any member been taken off for poor scholarship 
this latter shows another type of pluck well worthy 
of mention.
During the past season Tech has clearly outplayed 
every opponent, winning from such strong elevens as 
Western Reserve and Franklin and Marshall. One 
game only have they lost through inferior playing, 
and that was the direct result of a hard railroad trip 
and poor accommodations, leaving the team listless 
and without the snap necessary when a light team 
meets a heavier one. Tech has been clearly out
weighed in every game played. Her line averaged 
but little above 185 pounds, while her back field fell 
as low as 155 pounds.

---------------------------------------------------

4THE TARTAN
But one man on the team, Coldren, will graduate 
next June. If the others return, and are bolstered in 
weight by members of the incoming class, Tech 
should have a team easily capable of taking the local 
championship, and of capturing every game played 
with any minor college in the country. Tech is a 
trifle young in system and sentiment to tackle the 
larger institutions, like Yale, Havard and Princeton, 
but if her advancement next fall is as marked as it 
has been this past season, she need feel no fear of 
being disgraced in an early season competition with 
any of the big fellows.
The willing, aggressive game displayed by the 
light fast team during the last few weeks, has
BOARD OF CONTROL MEET.
demonstrated what may be accomplished with inex
perienced material to work on. Beginning next fall 
with practically a whcle team, already well framed, 
with an entering. class of strong, husky fellows, at
tracted by this years football successes, Tech should 
assume a position in the football world which will 
be recognized from coast to coast. It is the duty 
of Techs student bcdy to see that these men do 
not grow careless in their work, lax in their duties, 
or indifferent to student sentiment. With the high 
standard set by this years squad, Tech next season 
should have a team composed of men easily leaders 
in class room work, who are molders of student 
sentiment and who will stand for everything that is 
good for and will uplift Techs moral and ethical 
standard.
Tech men, I congratulate you on having a team 
capable of overcoming the obstacles and accom
plishing the results that your football team of 1909 
has. You should be as proud of it as I am.
Your Coach,
E. N. Snitjer.
Last Wednesday evening 15 members of the Board 
of Control met in the Apprentice and Journeymens 
buildingthe first meeting the Athletic Association 
representatives have had this year. John Charles 
opened the meeting by stating that since it was the 
first gathering, it would be necessary to comply 
with the requirements of the constitution by hav
ing an election of officers for the coming year. The 
election took place immediately with the following 
result: President, E. J. Hatcher; Vice President,
P. W. Schmidt; Secretary, H. J. McCorkle; Treas
urer, John Charles. With these men occupying 
their respective offices, the meeting continued.
The election of a manager for the baseball team 
was delayed until the next meeting, so that any can
didates for the position may have time to put in an 
appearance and be duly considered. The time of the 
monthly meeting of the Board was fixed for the first 
Wednesday of each month, except when it would fall 
on a holiday, then to be held on the second Wednes
day. The secretary will mail a notice of the meet
ing to all the members of the Board one week before 
the time of the meeting. The president desired to 
postpone the appointment of the regular standing 
committees until the next meeting to give time for 
him to receive suggestions of suitable persons for 
their membership. After it was decided to award 
the basketball C at the next meeting, a committee 
consisting of Hatcher, Williams and Gilkinson were 
appointed to arrange for having fire insurance 
placed upon the grandstands on Tech Field. The ex
penditure for the services of a publicity manager dur
ing the present football season was sanctioned. It 
was then decided to have three typewritten copies 
of the constitution made; one for the use of the 
president, one for the secretary, and the other to be 
kept in a safe deposit vault. The Board will likely 
order 500 printed in pamphlet form at the next meet
ing, as it was decided each holder of an Athletic 
Association ticket was entitled to a copy if he de
sired to have one. The election of a football man
ager for the coming year was held over until the 
next meeting. The Editor-in-Chief of The Tartan 
was present and outlined and discussed the relation
ship of the paper to the Association, and together 
with the president Of the Association arranged a 
plan of mutual co-operation. A vote of thanks was 
given to the Sophomore Class, Applied Science, Day, 
for making their loan of $100 a gift, and the meeting 
adjourned.

6THE TARTAN
A REVIEW OF THE SEASON OF 1909.
As this issue of The Tartan goes to press, the 
football season of 1909 has all but passed into his
tory. It has proven to be a very momentous one for 
Carnegie Tech, and we have just cause to pride our
selves upon the results. In the first place we have 
now a field that we may call our own. Heretofore 
this is a thing that never have we had, and this 
fact in itself should be enough to make us feel that 
the season has been a success. Tech field is the 
best college field in this part of the State, and one 
that has great possibilities in the way of future de
velopment. It possesses a natural stadium that, with 
a little added expense, can be turned into one of the 
finest of its kind in the country. So far as the play
ing field itself is concerned, little more could be
making a total loss of ten men who had won their 
letter the season previous. Out of the fifteen men 
who were given the C in 1908, there remained 
only four, Captain Hittner, McCorkle, Marshal and 
Hatcher. We had cne thing in our favor, however. 
We had a coach, E. N. Snitjer.
To this man belongs the credit of building up, ap
parently out of nothing, the most successful team 
that we have ever had. From new material he 
moulded a team that can be depended upon to give a 
good account of itself, no matter who its opponents 
may be. He put into it a spirit and a dash that 
refuses to be downed, no matter how the tide of the 
battle may be turning. Fast, hard, clean work has 
marked every game but one, the Marietta game. 
With a back field averaging not over 158 pounds to 
the man, Captain Hittners team has put away such
Captain Billy Hittner
asked. It is perfectly level, has a good sod, and dries 
quickly. In the latter respect it is better than the 
much-tooted Forbes Field which appears, in spite of 
the money spent upon it, to be inclined to dampness. 
While our seating capacity is not great it is ample 
for our present needs, and it affords a splendid view 
of all parts of the field. So much for the field.
When the football season opened the chances of 
success for our team were somewhat in doubt. We 
had only been playing football for three years and 
had never had what could be termed a really suc
cessful season. Under the conditions that prevail 
at colleges, it generally takes years to build up a 
successful team, and hei^ at Tech we are laboring 
under conditions that are to be met with at no other 
college. To make the chances of success seem even 
more remote we had lost by graduation three backfield men and four linemen. Three other C men 
failed to report, having dropped out of their classes,
foes as Western Reserve and Franklin and Marshall. 
Despite the fact that Tech has been outweighed by 
at least five pounds to the man in every game that 
she has played, she did not have a minute of time 
taken out on account of injuries during the first five 
games, and up to the time of going to press the total 
time taken out in the eight games of the season has 
not been over four minutes. This is a wonderful 
record for any team to make, but when you consider 
the fact that we have no gymnasium, no training 
house or table, the wonder of the thing grows upon 
you. The secret of the whole thing lies in the spirit 
that the coach and the captain have instilled into 
their men. So, to the coach, to the captain, to the 
manager, to those who have helped in anyway, be
longs the credit of giving to Tech the greatest foot
ball season in her history.
Below are given brief accounts of the games 
played, mentioning the principal features of each

The Westminster Game.
Tech opened her football season by defeating 
Westminster College by a score of 12 to 0. Tech sur
prised everybody by their speed, and they had the 
New Wilmington boys beaten before anybody real
ized it. Morris has the honor of making the first 
touchdown of the season for Tech. Flick made the 
second after a long run of 80 yards through a broken 
field.
Hittner, and Reserve shortly after pushed Corlette 
over. Reserve failed to kick the goal and this saved 
the game from having a tie score.
In the second half Tech outplayed Reserve, only 
once did Reserve threaten Techs goal, that was 
when Stewart, Reserves right-half, picked up a 
tumble back of Techs line and started down the 
field. Dolin made a pretty diving tackle from be
hind and that ended Reserves chances. This was 
the first time Techs goal was crossed.
The Dennison Tie.
On October 13th, the Dennison football team ar
rived here and played a tie game with Tech. The 
score was a tie, 0 to 0. The field was a sea of mud 
and it rained continually during the game, making 
it impossible to handle the ball with any certainty. 
A diagram of the game showed that Tech kept the

The Waynesburg Game.
The second game of the season was played with 
Waynesburg on our field, and Tech won handily, the 
score being 18 to 0. The game was one sided, Tech 
having possession of the ball most of the game. Long 
runs marked the game, Flick making one of 70 yards, 
and Captain Hittner later making one of 65 yards. 
Tech gained 50 yards on her forward pass, the ball 
going from Hatcher to Dolin.
The Western Reserve Game.
Tech won the first of her big games when she 
trimmed Western Reserve, of Cleveland, by the close 
score of 6 to 5. Last year the Western Reserve team 
won the Ohio State championship, and Tech hardly 
hoped to win the game. Both scores were made in 
the first half, Tech scoring on an 80-yard run by
ball entirely in Dennisons territory, being unable to 
score only on account of fumbles due to the wet 
condition of the ball.
The Lehigh Game.
Tech played her second football game with Lehigh 
University on October 30th. As in the first game two 
years ago, she lost, but the showing made by our 
team was highly creditable. In the first half Tech 
simply played the Lehigh team off their feet. Lehighs 
score in this half was due to an onside kick being 
blocked, a Lehigh man recovering the ball and carry
ing it over the line. Tech next scored and the first 
half ending with a tie score, 6 to 6.
In the second half Lehigh kicked to Tech. After 
the ball had see-sawed down the field and back, 
Coldren got possession of it on his own 9-yard mark 
and ran the length of the field for another touch---------------------------------------------------

down. Hittner missed the goal. On the next kick-off 
Lehigh got the bail on Techs 38-yard line by recover
ing a fumble. By straight football she carried it over 
and kicked the goal. She scored again later in the 
half, her heavy back field being too much for Techs 
line. Final score-Lehigh 18, Tech 11. The game 
was wonderfully fast and clean, Tech using the open 
style of play to great advantage.
A COMPARISON OF THE COLGATE AND TECH 
FOOTBALL TEAMS.
The Franklin and Marshall Game.
In the roughest game of the year Tech Avon from 
P. & M. by the score of 11 to 5. Tech completely out
played the visitors, gaining 593 yards to their 150 and 
making 28 first down to their ji. Tech really should 
h^.ve wen by a much larger score than she did, as 
seven times did she have the ball inside P. & M.s 
20-yard mark, only to lose it. Four times the ball 
was well inside F. & M.s 10-yard line.
F. & M. received the ball on the kick-off and inside 
of five minutes had crossed Techs goal line. The 
Tech rooters were pretty blue at this stage of the 
game but it did not take them long to recover. Tech 
received the ball on the kick-off and carried it right 
down the field and over the line. After this it was 
Techs game, as the F. & M. line was powerless be
fore her attack. The final score was 11 to 5.
The Marietta Game.
On November 13th Tech took the first of her two 
out-of-town trips, going to Marietta, Ohio, to play 
Marietta College. Tech lost the game by the score 
cf 13 to 0. At no time did she play with one-tenth 
the dash and spirit that has marked her work this 
year. A long six-hour train ride, together with the 
insufferably warm weather, proved too much of an 
obstacle to overcome.
The game consisted entirely of straight football 
with three or four attempts at forward passes. The 
Marietta team, as has been the case with every team 
that we have stacked up against this year, out
weighed us in all departments.
In the evening after the game Marietta gave us a 
dance and made our stay a most enjoyable one.
The Allegheny Game.
The details of this game will be found on another 
page of this issue, being received too late for use in 
this article.
The Colgate Game.
The last and greatest game of the season will be 
played on Thursday, our opponent being Colgate. 
Colgate has played the biggest teams in the East this 
season, and has an enviable record for the season. 
The game in detail, together with a diagram of all 
the plays, will appear in next weeks issue.
In the following tables the Colgate and Tech foot
ball teams are compared. By averaging the statistics 
it can be seen that Colgate outweighs Tech just 10 
pounds to a man. They are also two inches taller 
and average one year older. The outweighing of our 
team need not cause much worry, as it has been the 
case in every game that we have played this year:

EDITORIAL
OUR GAYER APPEARANCE.
We hope that the manner in which we have gotten 
up this issue will be pleasing to cur readers. It is 
our intention to use this style of cover paper a few 
weeks in order to test its popularity. Should we feel 
justified at the end of that time, we shall continue to 
do so. Arrangements are being made to have a 
number of headings and tailpieces made for the dif
ferent classes, clubs and societies, and to make the 
paper as attractive to the eye as possible. This is 
the first time we have appeared in the full dignity of 
twenty pages, but as such similar occasions arise, 
numbers of equal size and attractiveness will be got
ten out. How far we can safely carry our improve
ments, will be largely determined by the sale of this 
issue.
KEEP OFF THE GRASS.
There is too much cutting of corners and wiping of 
feet on the struggling lawn between the Science and 
the Trade Buildings. The boardwalks were put 
there to walk on, and the grass isnt thick enough to 
use as a door mat just yet. Walk on the walk, and 
KEEP OFF THE GRASS.
SOME NOTES ON SPIRIT.
The subject, Spirit, is one full of possibilities 
for argument or discussion here at Tech. Not that 
we especially lack that quality. On the contrary, 
the numbers and enthusiasm of our rooters during 
the present foot-ball season has caused favorable 
comment all over the city. Nor is the discussion of 
spirit wholly confined to Carnegie Tech. Judging 
from our exchanges this question appears to be en
grossing the attention of schools and colleges all over 
the country.
Spirit is a peculiar quality. It seems at times to 
flourish under the most unfavorable conditions, and 
again to languish under the most favorable.
School spirit is simply a manifestation of individual 
spiritwhich, in turn, is nothing but the outward 
evidence of honest, sportsmanlike qualities in the 
individual. These qualities are inherent, to a vari
able extent, in every representative of the human 
race; and spirit, in an educational institution is ob
tained by developing in the individual students a love 
of contest, admiration for feats of skill and strength, 
which require nerve for their performance, and a 
gamblers gamenessthe ability to be a game loser 
or a generous winner.
Add to this the respect and affection which every 
student should hold for his Alma Mater and his 
fellow students, and you have spirit.
Therefore, if you would have more spirit here, be 
friends with your fellow-students. Get acquainted. 
Be open and frank; cut out the cliques, eradicate the 
social barriers, at least in school, and get together. 
There are, of course, time-honored customs and ex
isting conditions which prevent the intermingling of 
classes. But mix with your own class, and as much 
as possible with members of other classes. Be dem
ocratic, friendly and courteous with your fellow-stu
dents, and if you are backward and diffident, you will 
soon find yourself becoming a thorough rooter; or if 
you have plenty of spirit yourself, you may be the 
means of winning over some fellow who might other
wise go through life with a very important part of 
his education sadly neglectedone who would other
wise miss the broadening, character-strengthening in
fluence of the spirit.
FILL OUT THE BLANK.
We would once more call your attention to tho 
blank provided for the purpose of cancelling your 
loan to the Athletic Association. There is nothing 
new to say on the subject. The conditions are the 
same now as they were last week. The long and the 
short of it all is that the Association needs the 
money and this is a way by which a great many may 
help. It is a mighty easy thing to do, and we hope 
everyone able will loose no time in handing in the 
blank.

THE TARTANil
THE BOARD OF CONTROL.
Before The Tartan went to press last week, the 
editors received the information contained in the edi
torial under this same caption. After we went to 
press it was learned that more of the classes had 
elected representatives to the Board of Control than 
was at first thought. The showing made the the first 
meeting of this Board (described elsewhere in these 
columns) was a very creditable one. Nearly every 
member was present, and many things that have 
been hanging fire ever since the opening of the 
schools this year were brought up and settled in a 
business-like manner. It looks very much as though 
the Associations affairs are at last getting into de
sirable shape. If the Board keeps on in the spirit 
in which they have started, the student body may 
know their representatives are on the job, and that 
Athletics are now run on a much more open basis. 
All students are privileged to attend the meetings.
WHITE FRIARS STILL SNOOZING.
A particularly noticeable amount of apathy seems 
to be mixed in with the lack of activity of the White 
Friars. After going to the trouble of adopting a con
stitution last year that provides a time of meeting, 
the present officers have let a month and a half go 
serenely by with nothing doing. We believe a meet
ing was attempted a few weeks ago, but on account 
of no notices being sent the members, it was ad
journed with no quorum. When Easter comes around 
the White Friars will be anxious to have the support 
of the entire student body; in the mean time they 
should make an attempt to warrant such support by 
getting down to business.
THE THANKSGIVING DAY PROGRAM.
The program to be issued by the Athletic Associa
tion for the game on Thursday with Colgate will be 
one of the handsomest ever issued for such an occas
ion. The cover has been specially designed for this 
game by Charles E. Moss, School of Applied Design, 
and is a work of art. An attempt will be made to 
reproduce the Maroon of Colgate in the color scheme 
of this design. The contents of the book will be as 
interesting as the cover, containing the record of our 
team this year, the line-up of the two teams, scoring 
spaces, and individual and team photographs. Be 
sure to buy yourself one and then buy one to send 
home; its worth it, and besides, we need the money.
PERTINENT 
AND

The Civils are developing a new branch of Mathe
matics called contagious problems. When one gets 
it, everyone gets it.

His Choice.
Now there were two women in one city; the one 
rich and the other poor.
Way back in the early sixties, there lived in the
village of M----- a girl by the name of Hilda. She
was fair to look upon, was Hilda with her dark hair, 
dark eyes, and rosy cheeks, and Tom thought so, too. 
He was a happy-go-lucky chap with not much am
bition except to get money by the least work possi
ble. He liked Hilda and she liked him. He liked 
her for her beauty, and, because she was admired 
by other young men, he decided to propose to her. 
He had as much as asked her, and she was busy 
planning for their future, when another young lady 
appeared on the scene. She was rich and ugly; 
Hilda, pretty and poor. Some one ^d once said that 
Hildas beautybut that is another story.
It didnt take Tom long to decide that he and Hilda 
would never get along well together, and rather than 
spoil her life, he would release her from her engage
ment to him. He wrote all this in a letter to her 
it would be so much easier for him than to go and 
tell her andTom hated scenes.
Hilda cried herself to sleep that night, and for 
many nights to come, while Tom and the rich young 
lady spent a happy honeymoon.
All of which goes to prove that beauty is only skin 
deep and does not count for much.

The Alma Mater song was published in a recent 
issue of the Tartan. Last year the Dean told us 
that she had seen the Director in regard to the last 
line in the chorusThy sons on high to raise, and 
he had readily agreed to change it to Thy name on 
high to raise. The way it now is, the girls certainly 
are not included, and although we are striving late 
and early to aid mankind in its upward struggles, 
we feel that we would be, and should be, represented, 
if this change were made.
Two Juniors were matching pennies in the studio. 
The capital consisted of four pennies, which were 
cheerfully divided when either went broke. A third 
Junior approached and said, Ill match your penny 
with a nickel, but Fate would not have it so, for the 
nickel was lost. The last Junior quickly grabbed her 
nickel and said, No, you dont, or I walk home.

The Plebe As are very aristocratic. They have a

Superstitions are always interesting things to 
listen to and laugh about, yet we do not realize how 
deeply the roots of these superstitions are planted in 
the present age. Most of us are more or less super
stitious even if we wont acknowledge it, so perhaps 
the number of superstitions heard from Mr. Church 
is Assembly will prove interesting. He said:
Most of our superstitions have come down to us 
by tradition from very early times, and the number 
superstitions are no exceptions.
The Ancients believed that even numbers were 
unlucky because they could be divided into two equal 
parts, and therefore signified death or dissolution; 
and as the even numbers were unlucky, the odd 
numbers were lucky. No good housewife would think 
of setting a hen without propitiating the evil fates, 
by putting under her an odd number of eggs.
The number one signifies unity or perfection; 
three is a significant number in all great religions. 
The Brahmins have their Trinity consisting of Brah
ma, Vishnu and Shiva. The Greeks and Romans had 
theirsJupiter, Neptune and Pluto, symbolized re
spectively by the three forked lightning, the trident 
and the three-headed Cerberus.
Six has always been the unluckiest of the even 
numbers. It indicates labor, suffering and misery. 
The probable reason for this is because the first six 
days of the world were days of toilthe days of 
Creation. Among the Ancients, the term of service 
was six years. Job endured six tribulations, and the 
manna sent from Heaven to the Israelities is said to 
have had the figure six inscribed upon it to indicate, 
not merely that it must be gathered during six days, 
but also the suffering and misery which would ensure 
if that command were disobeyed. Among the Romans, 
Tarquinius Sextus was the most tyrannical and cruel 
of all the Tarquins The reigns of Urban VI, Alexan
der VI, and Pius VI were remarkable for suffering 
and misfortune. To such an extent was this belief 
ascribed to the number six during the Middle Ages, 
that a certain Italian writer in speaking of the death 
of Alexander, the first duke of Florence, wrote as 
follows: He died in 1536 in the sixth year of his 
reign, on the sixth day of the month, at the sixth hour 
of the night, of six wounds, at the age of twenty-six. 
The six sixes make thirty-six, the number of the year 
of the century.
Seven has always been considered a number of 
good omen, possibly because after the six days of 
laboring, the seventh was a day of rest. We find fre
quent references in Scripture to the building of seven 
altars and the sacrificing of seven victims. Invalids 
were instructed to dip their clothing seven times in 
certain streams of water. Job served seven years 
for each of his wives, but this was a labor of love. 
A writer in the seventeenth century undertook to 
account for the superstition about the number seven 
by the fact that within the compass of ten, seven 
is the only number which neither begets nor is be

---------------------------------------------------

or- oTHoTt13
gotten , that is to say, of the first ten numbers, seven 
is the only number which is neither a factor nor a 
multiple of any of the others.
Periods cf seven years in the life of a man were 
spoken of as climacterics and marked important 
changes. Augustus Caesar is said to have expressed 
great happiness upon passing his sixty-third (nine 
times seven) birthday, because he felt that having 
passed that critical point he was assured of a long 
life to come.
Most of these superstitions have passed away, but 
even today intelligent and educated people are 
annoyed when they find themselves thirteen at a 
table or thirteen in a room, because of the well estab
lished belief that one of their number will die within 
a year. This superstition is attributed to the fact 
that at the Last Supper there were thirteen present, 
and one of the number, Judas Iscariot, died within a 
short time by his own hand.

TECH WINS FROM ALLEGHENY COLLEGE.
Another Mud Bath Contest.
The Tech foot-ball team defeated Allegheny College 
at Meadville on Saturday last by the score of 10-0. 
As in the Dennison game, the field was a sea of mud, 
On Friday there was four inches of snow on the field 
and when this melted it left the field in a condition 
that can better be imagined than described.
Tech presented a line-up that was greatly changed, 
Coach Snitjer holding the regulars for the Colgate 
game next Thursday. Tech was unable to use a sin
gle forward pass owing to the fact that the Allegheny 
management had failed to provide a new ball and
Tech was required to play with an old mishappen 
one that had seen usage.
The slippery condition of the field alone held Techs 
score to 10 points as time after time her backs would 
get away for long runs only to slip on dodging the 
last man. Three times Hittner was entirely loose, 
only to slip after going 25 or 30 yards.
Hatcher, who replaced Dolin, likewise made several 
clean get-aways, slipping just as he was about to get 
free. Once, however, he recovered a well-placed onside kick and got away 50 yards for a touchdown. 
Hatcher played a star game throughout.
McCcrkle ran the team in the first half and put up 
a first-class exhibit of foot-ball. He tried a drop kick 
from the 35-yard line, missing the goal posts by a 
narrow margin, the strong wind alone preventing it 
from going over.
Allegheny used her strongest line-up, but she suc
ceeded in making only three first downs in each half. 
The condition of the field and the ball were the only 
factors that kept Tech from scoring almost at will.

SECOND-YEAR INDUSTRIALS.
The notices recently appearing on the bulletin 
board, commanding the Freshies to wear green caps, 
spread consternation among them. The worst of it 
is that they have to be worn at once.
An Industrial Club is soon to be organized.
A good many of the fellows are making arrange
ments for going home on Thanksgiving, should remember that the Thanksgiving game is the climax 
of the season, and stay an extra day or so to see it.

the Dean. Some of the pictures will be used in the 
Thistle.
Now that the first yearlings have gotten over their 
game of Duckey, Duckey, Who is the Next to be 
Ducked, it would be a fine plan for the Second-Year 
fellows to wash the heads of those who have no caps, 
so that their heads can resume their normal size 
and they can procure caps to fit.

he offers to the students with the request that they 
be smoked in the Club Room.
Now that preparations have begun on the 1910 
Thistle, the Industrial School must get busy and 
make a good showing with the other schools.

On Wednesday evening, November 10th, the Mho 
Club held its monthly meeting. Mr. C. R. Dooley, of 
the Westinghouse Electric Co., gave a talk on the 
change from school life to active shop work, which 
was full of interest and good advice. As necessary 
qualities for success in practical life in the shop he 
puts get-along-ability first, sound judgment and 
horse-sense second, and lastly technical training. The 
remainder of the evening was spent in consuming 
the refreshments and smokes furnished by the com

Mill at Braddock on Saturday afternoon, November 
27th.
All members should be at the School at one oclock 
sharp, as we must catch a train in order to arrive 
together at two oclock. Come out, boys. There is 
going to be a lot of good stuff to be seen at the mill.
Lloyd and Ziringer, our class mates, as well as 
the other members of the Tech team were agreeably 
surprised on Saturday just before the Marietta game 
to receive the following telegram from the Club:  
Carnegie Technical Schools Foot-ball Team, Mari

Mechanical Draughtmens Club. B. J. Patterson.
It was not because of lack of good wishes that our 
boys lost. Better luck Thanksgiving!
CRUCIBLE CLUB.
On Wednesday evening the Cr'/cible Club met in 
Room 121. The speaker of the evening was Dr. 
Schaeffer who gave a very interesting and instruc
tive talk on Test Fence and Laboratory Investiga
tions of Paints. Results of research in connection 
with ihe Pittsburgh and Atlantic City Test Fences of 
the Bureau of Promotion and Development, Paint 
Manufacturers Association, were reviewed, various 
experiments were described, and the apparatus used 
in taking photomicrographs of paint surfaces was 
shown.
Following the lecture, Mr. Thomson, who last year 
served the Club as President, made a few remarks 
to the men and then the usual social hour was en
joyed.
The students in Metallurgy, Mining, and Chemis
try who are not availing themselves of the benefits 
of the Crucible Club meetings are losing much in 
the way of technical information, for the lectures 
are on subjects which are of interest to all students 
in those departments.
INDUSTRIALS.
The Industrial School will be represented by a fast 
basket-ball team this coming season. A call for can
didates will be issued soon as a hall can be procured 
for practice.

good basket-ball for their High School teams have 
reported: Solomon of Allegheny High School, Barkwell of Sewickley High School, Sane of Meadville 
High School, Shelby of Braddock High School; also 
McCracken, Letsche, Kincaide, Lea, Walker, Hawson and Kiefer.
Dolin, Blanchard, Huggins, Vance, Williams and

Everyyone knows that a college education is a 
sheer waste of time, asserted the bachelor of 50, 
swallowing the sixth little neck clam, and turning to 
the girl on his right. Three or four of the best 
years of his life are simply thrown away. He studies 
as little as the rules of the college will permit, and 
acquires a lot of expensive and often unwholesome 
habits.
M-m. That is true, answered the girl on his 
right.
And yet it is generally conceded that a young 
man cannot spend three years or so to better ad
vantage than as a college undergraduate. He de
velops brain and body, and learns how to work, how 
to play and how to keep healthy.

right.
Sighing profoundly, the bachelor of 50 attacked the

AN INQUIRY.
One day last week, while leaving the school, we 
were approached by a fellow and a girl, who were 
evidently not residents of Pittsburg.
The young man accosted us on the approach to 
the bridge, and, pointing to the A. and J. building, 
said: Can you tell me what that building is?
That, we impressively replied, is one of the build
ings of the Carnegie Technical Schools.
Oh! said the young man, in a disappointed tone, 
Aint there a menagerie in this park?
We scrutinized his countenance, and noted the 
guileless expression thereon; also, we mentally cal
culated the weight of his fist and the length of his 
reach and decided to let him live. So we turned 
away, disdainfully.

APPLIED DESIGN
The rehearsals for the Minstrel Show have been 
fast and furious. The songs are full of spirit and 
catchy, being learned very quickly. It really looks 
as if Mr. Hornbostels bluff would be called, and that 
a summer scholarship was to be a reality. The win
ner of this prize certainly ought to give a commis
sion to the Minstrels. Getting a minstrel show up in 
two weeks is not done for the health, as Sheppard 
will testify.
There were a good many conditions in Mr. Me* 
Goodwins office last week!
Class A men, if alive, will be scarce this week.
We all wish to congratulate Hatcher for being 
elected to the presidency of the Athletic Association.
Last Monday night the Night students of the School 
of Applied Design met and formed an organization 
to look after their interests in the Schools. The fol
lowing officers were elected: President, E. W. Boyer; 
vice president, Mr. Bahl; secretary, Wm. D. McCor
mick; treasurer, Henry W. Peebles.
The question of student government was discussed. 
It was decided to elect a senate, to hold a conference 
with the day senate, and decide if one senate will be 
able to govern both the day and night students. The 
following were elected: Brandon Smith, Clyde W. 
OBrien, Henry W. Peebles, Mr. Bahl and Mr. Steffier.
The night students will be represented In Ath
letics* by Walter A. McCarty.
This Is the first time the students of this depart
ment have had an organization to look after its in
terests. With these officers installed, they will now 
be well represented In all student activities.

On Tuesday evening, November 23rd, the widely 
discussed and carefully rehearsed Minstrel Show of 
the School of Applied Design will be given in their 
quarters in the Trade Building. During the past 
week many new and pleasing features have been 
added to the already interesting program. Good 
solos and tuneful choruses, sprightly dances and 
funny jokes will be the features of the monster 
benefit for the football team.
The splendiforous conglomeration of unpreced
ented and incomprehensible magnificulity will be a 
colossal example of indisproportionableness; the 
ma.Timnm of entertainment for the minimum of 
price. The seating capacity will be ample, and a 
large audience is expected. Tickets can be had from 
any member of the School of Applied Design. It will 
be a good show for a good cause.
