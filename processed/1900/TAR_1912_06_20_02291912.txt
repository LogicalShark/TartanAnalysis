PROGRAM FOR MUSICAL CLUBS 
HOME CONCERT.
To those who heard last years 
splendid home concert it will be sur
prising to learn that 1912 concert is 
expected to far surpass it in all re
spects. Not only does the program, 
which is printed below in full, in
clude several original features, but 
the Clubs have secured an exception
ally high degree of perfection in the 
execution of the selections, which is 
due to faithful work on the part of 
the members and to the inexhaustible 
energy of the directors.
It will be noticed that the program 
for the Mandolin Club contains com
positions that are rarely performed 
outside of a professional orchestra. In 
addition to a number of popular for
eign airs and such classical music as 
the Fantasie aus Wilhelm Tell, es
pecial attention must be called to Di
rector Gregorio Scalzos new compo
sition named Reverie, which was 
written especially for the Mandolin 
Club. It was put on with enormous 
success at the Hiland Theater and at 
Pitcairn. A mandolin quartette, com
posed of Greg. Scalzo, Lewis R. Madi
son, Harold A. Warne and J. Daniel 
Brendel has prepared a number of 
good selections for this concert and 
will appear as a special feature. It 
may finally be mentioned that this 
year the mandolin music will be 
strengthened by the addition of traps.
Upon the shoulders of the Glee 
Club men largely rests the difficult 
task of moulding the public into a 
receptive mood, and its program 
shows that it has well taken care of 
its part of the work. The comic part 
has been supplied by including a num
ber of high-grade funny selections. 
The Glee Club will present as its spe
cial feature an octette, selected from
fifty good singers, and composed of 
Messrs Hogdon, Gardiner, Schuchman, Kukovitch, R. M. Crawford, 
Kindi, Button, R. S. Crawford.

THE DIRECTORS OF THE 
MUSICAL CLUBS.
Sgn. GREGORIO SCALZO
All factors have contributed to make 
this season very successful for the 
Musical Clubs, but especial attention 
must be called to the efforts of Di
rectors Gregorio Scalzo and Robert 
J. McDowall, who deserve much credit 
for their excellent work. No matter 
how much executive ability the mem
bers of the Clubs have, the finishing 
touch has to be supplied by compe- j 
tent musical men with the ability that 
the Directors of the Glee and Mando
lin Clubs possess.
Last year Sgn. Scalzo led the Man
dolin Club to a Home Concert which 
brought down the house, and the 
Clubs have been very fortunate in 
again securing his services this season. 
Mr. Scalzo is a mandolin player of 
international fame. At an early age 
he toured Europe and South America 
as a violin virtuoso, and later stayed 
with the other Americans for a con- ! 
siderable time. He pursued his mu(Continued on Page 4.)

THE MOREWOOD AVENUE 
APPROACH.
On the evening of April 27, 1911, a 
notable mass meeting was held in Car
negie Music Hall, one which will lin
ger long in the minds of those at
tending. It was notable chiefly for 
three things: first, we had entirely 
to ourselves for the first time in our 
history, our Founder, Mr. Carnegie; 
secondly, several announcements con
cerning matters of vital import and 
interest to the student-body were 
made; thirdly, for the attendance and 
enthusiasm displayed throughout the 
evening. It marked in many ways a 
turning point in our career as an in
stitution.
One of the announcements made, 
was that a probable entrance to the 
property of the institution would be 
had by the opening up and extension 
of Morewood avenue. This announce
ment was greeted with prolonged 
cheering from all parts of the hall and 
from all classes of students. It was 
a matter which did not affect one 
particular class or group, but which 
had to do with the well-being of the 
student-body as a whole. That, and 
that only is the reason the enthusiasm 
was so general.
The reaching of the buildings is
not, under the best of circumstances, 
an easy matter. In good weather, 
warm and dry, the distance to travel 
seems great enough, but on mornings 
such as we have had these few weeks 
past the way seems to stretch out 
almost indefinitely. Bad as the day 
students think this approach, it is 
immeasurably worse for the night 
students who are required to hurry 
through their evening meal after a 
hard days work and to take that long 
walk in all sorts and conditions of 
weather. On stormy nights the 
classes are much smaller, due in a 
large measure to the difficulty of 
reaching the recitation rooms, and 
this is a great hindrance to the doing 
of work as efficient as would other
wise be accomplished. This matter 
of time and distance is one of vital 
importance to every member of the 
student-body.
To get down to approximate dis
tances: from the nearest Fifth avenue 
car line to the center of the school 
site is about forty-five hundred feet 
or over three-quarters of a mile; from 
the nearest Forbes street car line to 
the same point is approximately three 
thousand feet or over one-half mile. 
Many of the Margaret Morrison 
students have to come by way of Fifth 
avenue and, since they can not trans
fer to the Forbes street cars, are 
forced either to pay an extra nickle 
or walk a distance of three-quarters 
of a mile. By the opening of the pro
posed Morewood avenue entrance, 
these distances will be shortened to 
approximately eighteen hundred feet, 
a saving which needs nothing else to 
commend it. It can hardly be won
dered, therefore, that the enthusiasm 
which greeted the announcement con
cerning this new approach was so 
spontaneous and so general.
In the founding and endowing of 
these schools Mr. Carnegie has done 
more, considerably more, than he first 
agreed to do. He has given to the 
City of Pittsburgh an institution 
equipped to do work equal to that 
done along similar lines anywhere in 
the world. It behooves the city to 
put to the best possible uses these 
benefactions, so lavishly showered 
upon it, by making the means of 
reaching them as accessible and as 
convenient as possible, and this it is 
not doing when it fails to open up 
the Morewood Avenue approach.

ITEMS OF GENERAL INTEREST.
In view of the general disturbance 
throughout Mexico, it is interesting 
to note that Mr. Fred E. Foster, 08 
Science, is somewhere in the midst of 
it all. Mr. Foster, while in Carnegie, 
was the first editor of The Tartan, 
and since graduation has traveled over 
no inconsiderable portion of South 
America. The Tartan is making an 
effort to obtain from Mr. Foster a 
letter giving an account of the revolu
tion and his experiences.* * *
Miss Stoner gave a delightful con
cert to the M. M. C. S. girls on Mon
day, the 19th. Selections were ren
dered by the Glee Club and a trio com
prised of Miss Stoner, Miss Nelson, 
and Miss Williams. Miss Amy Jonap 
gave several violin solos.* * *
Myron P. White, formerly of the 
Electric Wiring class of 09, writes 
from Gary, Indiana, where he is en
gaged in electrical construction work 
in the plant of the Pittsburgh Screw 
and Bolt Company.* * *
Doctor Martin, after a short illness, 
has been spending the past week in 
Atlantic City in order to regain her 
health. It is expected that she will 
return in a few days.* * *
In order to raise money for a new 
building, the girls at Wellesley are col
lecting a mile of pennies. Each girl 
is given a foot rule with slots in which 
to place the pennies, 5,280 of these 
being used. It is expected that a con
siderable amount of money will be 
raised in this manner.

Lowell W. Nichols, who has been 
with Pearsons Magazine for the past 
year, has recently accepted a position 
on the editorial staff of McClures. 
In a letter to Mr. Field he says a little 
about his work:
One of the most pleasant features 
of the work is the people with whom 
one comes into contact. Among those 
of more or less note whom I have re
cently met outside of our own staff 
are Mary Shaw, the author-actress 
of Mrs. Warrens Profession fame, 
James Montgomery Flagg, Orson 
Lowell, F. Graham Cootes, F. R. Gruger, Wm. J. Burns, the National De
tective, and others of prominence. The 
members of our own staff are no less 
interestingS. S. McClure, founder 
and editor of the magazine, George 
Kibbie Turner and Burton J. Hend
rick, special writers on political and 
uplift topics and Viola Roseboro, 
the fiction critic. Nearly all I have 
mentioned are modest and unassum
ing and really human when met 
through connection with the maga
zine.

Among the recent visitors to the 
buildings were M. B. King, new State 
Superintendent of Industrial Educa
tion; Miss Rose Fetterolf, State Supt. 
of Drawing in Western Pennsylvania; 
Dr. George D. Strayer, Columbia Uni
versity; Dr. E. E. Cook, Baltimore 
College; Prof. C. L. Buschong, Uni
versity of Kansas; Mr. George D. Pilner, Wallace, Idaho; Mr. J. N. Greer

INTERESTING LETTER RE
CEIVED.
Sellner, 09, Writes From Nicaragua.
A very interesting letter has been 
received by Secretary Field from S.
S. Sellner, 09 Science. The letter was 
written from the interior of Nicaraqua, 
the mine in which he is working, be
ing reached only after what sounds 
like a rather strenuous trip up rivers 
and over mountains. Mr. Sellner men
tions that on his way up the river, 
which is very swift, he met a canoe 
taking gold down. The canoe hit a 
rock and was overturned, the natives 
losing all the gold and just getting out 
with their lives. He remarks in an 
off-handed manner, that life is not 
a very safe venture in that part of the 
world with nature, fevers, and the na
tives all ready and willing to take a 
stab at you.
Now that he has arrived there fresh 
from home, Mr. Sellner voices wonder 
that he ever returned to it again. He 
says that it is very monotonous, noth
ing to do but rotine work and loaf. 
The only way of enjoying their leisure 
time is by Listening to the strains 
of our graphophone and watching the 
beautiful Southern sky, discussing the 
things we would do if in civilization. 
In the dry season it is a Garden of 
Eden, minus the Eve. It is a month 
between mails and the newspapers are 
six weeks old. Truly, it must be a 
joyful life.
---------o---------
WHITE FRIARS MEET.
Another Meeting To Be Held March 4 
Plans Discussed.
The White Friars held a meeting on 
the 20th, and those present discussed 
the ways and means of injecting a lit
tle life into their organization and the 
prospects of giving a show this year. 
The attendance was disappointingly 
small, so small in fact that it was 
impossible to elect officers of the year. 
The only thing done was to discuss 
plans and to call another meeting. This 
meeting will be held on the evening 
of March 4th, in Room 104. At this 
time officers will be elected and ar
rangements made to go ahead and put 
on a show before June. Should there 
not be enough members turn out to 
hold the election, the movement to 
put the Friars on their feet drop and 
this once famous and prosperous or
ganization will pass out of existence. 
It is the duty, therefore, of every mem
ber to turn out at this meeting and 
preserve for the institution this stu
dent activity which is so badly needed.
---------o---------
LEATHER BOUND THISTLES.
Any person or persons desiring their 
copy of The Thistle bound in leather, 
with their name or the name of the 
person to whom they wish to give it 
stamped in gold on the front, may do 
so by paying one dollar and a half 
($1.50) additional to any member of 
The Thistle Board. All copies unless 
otherwise stated will be bound in 
cloth.

THE TARTAN3
THE HOME CONCERT
Carnegie Hall, March 7, 8:15 P. M.
The Seventh Annual Home Concert 
ot the Combined Glee and Mandolin 
Clubs will be held at Carnegie Music 
Hall on the evening of March 7th. 
The concert will be followed by a 
dance at the Schenley Hotel, which 
will last from 10:30 till 2 oclock. The 
results of seven years of hard work on 
the part of the officers and members 
will at this concert be shown before 
the public. The entire student body 
will then have an opportunity to ac
knowledge its indebtedness to this 
oldest of student organizations for the 
splendid contributions it has made to 
the establishment of the Carnegie 
name in this part of the state.
Tickets for the concert are on sale 
by all the members of the Glee and 
Mandolin Clubs. A student discount 
of 25 cents is allowed on all tickets 
except those at $1.50. Student tickets 
therefore range from 25 cents to $1.50 
in price. These tickets must be ex
changed for a reserved seat. Re
served seats can be procured until 
March 5th at Room 119, Industries 
Building, and after March 5th at S. 
Hamilton Co.s, 531 Wood street. 
With the $1.50 tickets a special coupon 
will be given, which entitles the holder 
to attend the dance at the Hotel 
Schenley. For next years concert, 
the management contemplates to pro
vide not only a concert and dance for 
the price of one ticket, but also taxi
cabs and a vast supply of flowers for 
the fair sex. The advantages of in
cluding a buffet supper are likewise 
being discussed.
The attention of those intending to 
procure tickets is directed to Gris
wolds curve of prices appearing on 
tne bulletin board in the Science 
Building. The purpose is to have
dx
every prospective purchaser find
dy
ai a point corresponding as nearly as 
possible to the fourth dimension of 
his pocketbook.
The program for this years con
cert will include a number of attract
ive and interesting features. The 
musical part will be found in full in 
another column of this issue.
The management is positive in de
manding that some of the most strik
ing parts of the program shall be kept 
secret. The Tartan regrets, therefore, 
being unable to elucidate sufficiently 
upon the merits of the stage managers 
work. It is permitted, however, to 
acquaint the public with the fact that 
the second part of the program will 
be something entirely new and origi
nal. A surprise may be safely looked 
forward to.
For the nifty poster in the hall of 
the Science Building the Clubs are 
indebted to Mr. Elvin Tilton.
It is evident that the degree of per
fection secured by the Clubs cannot 
be obtained with an off-hand one-hour 
rehearsal once a week. Throughout 
this season the members have sacri
ficed their entire Sunday afternoon for 
rehearsals. During the last two 
months two hours in addition have 
been required nearly every Saturday 
afternoon. All this has been done for
the sake of putting on an irreproach
able Home Concert. The Home Con
cert has been an annual feature ever 
since the clubs started, and it is pri
marily intended for the students of 
the Carnegie Technical Schools. You 
have not the right to call yourself a 
real Carnegie student if you do not 
make an effort to be present at this 
concert, thereby disregarding the sac
rifices made and the inconveniences 
put up with by forty-two men for 
your sake. Remember, this is the only 
time during the season that the Clubs 
can call on you for your individual 
support.
Ample time will be allowed between 
the concert and the dance to enable 
the guests to move from one place 
to the other. Last year the dance fea
ture was new, and the generally ex
pressed satisfaction then led the man
agement to make this an annual fea
ture. The Clubs have succeeded in 
having the music furnished by an ex
ceptionally good five piece orchestra.
---------------o---------------
BASKETBALL LEAGUE.
The Science Plebes again upset the 
dope in the basketball league, being 
trimmed by Sigma Tau 18 to 13. The 
frat men took the lead at the start, 
and, although, the Plebes came back 
strong in the second half, they parted 
to overcome the lead of their oppon
ents.
The second game between Soph 
Science and Industry was forfeited to 
the latter as the Sophs failed to put 
in an appearance. It is regretted that 
the Sophs have to drop out, having 
failed to get a team together. It looks 
like a lack of class-spirit somewhere.
The final game of the day was be
tween Woodlawn Club and T. A. C. 
This game proved one of the fastest 
that has been played thus far, the 
former winning 13 to 11. T. A. C. 
started out with a rush and kept the 
lead almost until the close of the 
game, when Woodlawn came from 
behind and nosed them out in an ex
citing finish.

education at Princeton. While there, 
he was tenor soloist in the Prince

year of his attendance he acted as 
leader of that organization. Later, 
the celebrated Moody Quartette of 
Chicago counted him among its mem

Washington, Pa. Those that have 
seen Mr. McDowalls lively guestures

CARNEGIE TECHNICAL SCHOOLS : PITTSBURGH
T
^HE Carnegie Technical Schools consist of four 
separate schools, each with its own faculty, buildings 
and student body. The courses of instruction 
offered in these four schools differ widely.
School of Applied ScienceOffers courses in chemical, 
civil, electrical, commercial, mechanical, metallurgical, 
mining and sanitary engineering.
School of Applied DesignOffers courses in architecture, 
interior decoration, illustration and painting, open to both 
men and women.
School of Applied IndustriesOffers industrial courses in 
machine construction, building construction, and elec
trical equipment and installation. Short courses are offered 
in the various trades for applicants with experience. A 
new course to equip men as teachers in manual training 
and in trade school work is also offered. The increasing 
demand for such men provides an attractive field for the 
progressive young mechanic and the public school teacher
Margaret Morrison Carnegie SchoolFor women only. 
Offers courses in household economics, secretarial work, 
dressmaking, and costume illustration and design. Be
cause of the demand for trained teachers, graduate courses 
are offered for those who wish to prepare for the many 
positions now open for women in these newer lines of work.
Night CoursesThe four schools offer night courses in 
practically all of the above subjects to provide educational 
opportunities for those who are at work during the day.

THE TARTAN5
HISTORICAL SKETCH OF THE 
CARNEGIE MUSICAL CLUBS.
1905 to 1912.
Some seven years ago a small num
ber of students from the charter 
classes planned a smoker and at that 
smoke the foundation was laid for 
what is now known as the Glee and 
Mandolin Clubs. Successfully they 
overcame innumerable difficulties, and 
today we see them before us more 
powerful than ever, with a clean rec
ord of ever increasing prosperity.
The first and second years of their 
existence saw nothing of importance 
done except the rendering of two 
home concerts at Carnegie Hall. Even 
during the third year the manage
ment did not attempt any out of town 
trips, but devoted all its attention to 
strengthening the Clubs and perfect
ing their organization. A number of 
concerts in Pittsburgh and the sub
urbs were also given. During the 
fourth year the first out-of-town con
certs were rendered and met with a 
hearty approval. The number of 
Pittsburgh concerts was also increas
ed. The fifth and sixth year offered 
an opportunity for one Christmas 
trip, and several concerts were given 
at considerable distances from Pitts
burgh.
Thus we arrive at the seventh year 
of the existence of the musical clubs, 
and though the result of the work will 
be heard at the home concert next 
Thursday, a brief review of its acchievements is warranted by the fine 
progress made. The season has been 
very successful both financially and
THE
otherwise. Large auidences were at
tracted wherever entertainment was 
put on.
The Clubs have been very fortunate 
in retaining almost all of last years 
members and in getting hold of sev
eral new men of considerable ability. 
With directors that are prominent in 
the musical world and with no small 
amount of energy on the part of the 
officers and members, the Carnegie 
Musical Clubs will now rank with any 
college organization of this character 
in the United States. In order that 
the reader may not misunderstand our 
statements, we mention that the above 
fact has been testified to by the musi
cal men prominent in their profes
sion.
During the 1911-1912 season the fol
lowing concerts were given:
October 27, 1911East Liberty Expo
sition.
November 25, 1911Lawrence Park 
School.
December 8, 1911Kingsley House. 
January 13, 1912University Club. 
February 6, 1912Hiland Theatre, for 
East Liberty Business Mens Asso
ciation.
February 9, 1912Pitcairn, Pa. 
February 10, 1912Newsboys Home. 
February 22, 1912Hotel Schenley7 
MARCH 7th, 1912, 8:15 P. M. 
HOME CONCERT, CARNEGIE 
MUSIC HALL.
To say that every one of them was 
appreciated would be putting it mildly. 
The entire season was a success. We 
take pleasure in printing the follow
ing quotations:
From Pittsburgh Chronicle TelcCAL CLUBS_______________
graph, February 7:
The musical and vocal entertain
ment at the Hiland theatre was ren
dered by the East Liberty Business 
Mens Association to the Womens 
Auxiliary of their organization last 
night. Very fine music was furnished 
by the combined Glee and Mandolin 
Clubs of the Carnegie Technical 
Schools. Mrs. Corinne Hohn Half 
gave two readings and Robert Craw
ford sang a solo. Nearly 2,000 per
sons were present.
From a local Pitcairn paper:
A crowded house enjoyed the en
tertainment by the Carnegie Techni
cal Schools Musical Clubs, held in 
the M. E. Church auditorium. All 
features of the Glee and Mandolin 
Clubs program were highly enter
taining. From all points the enter
tainment was of an exceptionally fine 
quality.
While not very descriptive, these 
clippings show that our Clubs are do
ing excellent work, and if we may 
judge from what has been achieved 
in the seven years of their existance, 
we can safely expect them to make 
oetter progress in the future.
We are informed that the following 
concerts will be rendered after the 
Home Concert:

6THE TARTAN
NEW SUGGESTION AS TO TECH 
BABY QUALIFICATIONS.
In The Tartans hunt for the Tech 
Baby it has met with a new sugges
tion. This point, raised by the Alum
nae Association of M. M. C. S., is 
worthy of consideration. It is as fol
lows :
In order to qualify, the said Tech 
Baby must present as credentials the 
following: One heirloom, descending 
in the material line, consisting of one 
Day Graduates M. M. C. S. diploma, 
issued in the said Tech Babys moth
ers maiden name; also, one heirloom, 
descending in the paternal line, con
sisting of one C. T. S. diploma issued 
in the fathers name.
The executive committee of the 
Alumnae Association of M. M. C. S. 
has recommended the immediate con
tribution of twenty-five cents, more 
or less, by each member of the Alum
nae, the amount of this collection to 
be used to purchase a suitable gift 
for the Tech Baby.
This suggestion seems a good one 
and will be given immediate consid
eration. In the issue of next week 
it will be anounced whether the ac
tion taken upon this matter by those 
who have instituted this search is 
favorable or not. It is also hoped 
that more definite news can be given 
as to the progress of the search than 
is possible to make at this time.---------o---------

MHO CLUB MEETING.
City Office;
631 Penn AvenueEast End Office 
Highland Ave. and Baum Street
The moderate weather has brought 
out quite a few track men in the past 
week, and with the opportunity offer
ed by the new board track, not only 
for the training, but for general use 
of the students, it bids fair to be a 
popular place in the next few weeks.
The call for baseball candidates has 
brought out a large number of men 
and it is hoped this number will be 
increased within the next week. The 
baseball men, especially pitchers, 
should make it a point to get out and 
warm up every day. It is expected 
that, despite numerous warnings, j 
some of them wrill try and cut loose | 
with speed and curves before they 
have got the kinks out of their arms, I 
which is usually a sign of greenness, 1 
as well as enthusiasm. Dont be one \ 
of the green ones.
Students are cautioned about cov- j 
ering windows and door panels with j 
mats before starting to throw the ball i 
around. It will save considerable time j 
inconvenience and expense.
If you play ball come out and hand 
your name to Manker.
Practice wrill be held on Monday 
and Wednesday afternoons from 4 to
5, instead of Tueday and Thursday; 
also Saturday mornings 10 to 12.
We expect to start a baseball league 
similar to the present basketball 
league as soon as we can get out 
doors. Fraternities, clubs and classes 
should begin to look around to get 
their teams together. The faculty 
expect to be strong contenders in this 
branch of sport as they have many 
old time college stars among their 
number.
The regular meeting of the Mho 
Club was held on Wednesday eve
ning, February 21st. There being no 
speaker for the evening, the regular 
business of the club was taken up, 
after which officers for the second 
semester were elected. The result 
was as follows:
PresidentW. C. Brand.
Vice PresidentF. I. Sigman.
Secretary and TreasurerR. W. 
Freeland.
Executive CommitteeDiehl, Stuckman, Griswold.
Athletic RepresentativeA. J. Pet

After the election of officers Mrs. 
Brand assumed the duties of office 
and spoke a few minutes on the sub
ject of club attendance.
The meeting was adjourned and the 
members enjoyed the usual feed 
for the evening.

THE TARTAN7
THE TARTANS LETTER BOX.
The Tartan is very pleased to re
ceive at any time signed communica
tions on subjects of interest to the 
student-body and will print the same 
whenever space permits. For the 
sentiments expressed in these commu
nications The Tartan is not respon
sible.
SCHOOL SPIRIT AMONG THE 
NIGHT STUDENTS.
Biff! Bang! and some razor-back 
has let out a squeal about lack of 
class spirit, or school spirit, or any 
old kind of spirit, among the night 
students. In a sense, perhaps, this 
squeal has a just cause behind it.
Due allowance should be made, how
ever, for the very limited time some 
of us can spend in school. The fact 
is, business duties during the day ab
solutely prohibits most of us from 
coming out to sports and other events 
which occur in daylight. For exam
ple, the writer, a member of the night 
class in electric wiring, resides in 
Bellevue, and anyone that has been 
up against traction facilities in Pitts
burgh knows what a hardship it is 
to make the trip from work to Belle
vue and then back to Oakland in time 
for the 7:30 P. M. classes, to say 
nothing of the lateness of the hour 
on the home stretch. If a man be 
marriedit almost means divorce; if 
a single fellowsome lazy pinhead 
(whose ambition one could revolve on 
the point of a needle), walks off with 
his best girl.
Now, as to a few remedies that 
might help in arousing more class 
spirit among us: Why not provide
something in the way of diversion of 
a distinctive school type? Class ral
lies, popular entertainments; let the 
Glee Club try it on the dog by giv
ing us a concert; lets have an oldfashioned literary or a debate, there 
are those among us who know how 
it was done; an old-fashioned spell
ing match by a score or two of hardy 
volunteers? All these in Room in 
104 and why not? Thus we can get 
acquainted with the members of the 
other classes and schools. You know 
the old song, When good fellows get 
together, etc.
As a proof to how the boys respond 
to proper treatment:At a recent 
gathering of the night students, while 
waiting for the photographer to take 
our pictures for the Thistle, someone 
called upon Mr. Calderwood to speak 
a few spokes. Well, he gave us a 
whole wheel with some extra spokes 
thrown in for good measure. When 
he commenced to unreel figures about 
attendance we didnt know there were 
so many guys around us until he 
stood them up, 100-200-300-400-500 
order, then we began to realize how 
big- we are.
Then he got his electric blow torch 
to goinsr about school spirit and com
menced to put the knife into the in
sulation of our indifference, at the 
same time turning: the spot licht on 
The Thistle: he cut and scraped until 
we were all nice and bright and then
the wires were readv to tap for,---------
subscriptions to the above named 
iajrirer. Well say! ! There was a 
short circuit from our pockets to the
publishers pockets and before the leak 
was stopped five dollars per minute 
flowed at such a rate that the subscrip
tion takers fell all over themselves 
trying to carry away the dollars. 
Twenty-five subscriptions in five min
utes.
Now stand up and say that we have 
no spirit. The night students are 
there with the goods if they have a 
show, and dont let your craniums get 
fogged for a moment with the belief 
that they are not.
Let class officers and organization 
representatives get a hustle. Meet us 
half way. We are not dubbs if we 
are green and dont know the ropes. 
Whats our nightly menu?
Hot work, two hours.
Next day no flowers,
Back again at work.
Must hustle, never shirk.
This is it, yet for all the above 
crowded bill of fare, the most of us 
would stay for special stunts, though 
havent time to prepare them our
selves.
What about Director Hamerschlag? 
Well, any time he desires to set it 
up to us boys in the shape of a few 
kind words, heres telling you hell 
get the boys. Then what about Dean 
Connelley, and our instructors? Yes, 
and last but not least our Registrar, 
the man we usually see, only when 
we kiss our coin good-bye at enroll
ment, or stand before his royal high
ness on the carpet. Why not have 
these call us together and talk to us 
about class spirit? Talk to us? Why 
sure Mike! Let us know what is 
wanted, to help those who are trying 
to help us, and then see the sparks 
fly.
These remarks apply, I suppose, to 
the night students in Science and De
sign as well. If they are anywhere 
near to the point and you think so, 
fellows, big and little, lets start some
thing, and by the aid of the men 
higher up maybe we can develop as 
much class spirit and surely of as 
good a quality as the day men, who 
have ten chances to our one.

ILLUMINATING ENGINEERS 
SOCIETY.
At a dinner given at Jhe Fort Pitt 
Hotel on February 12, the Pittsburgh 
Section of the Illuminating Engineers 
Society was organized and the follow 
ing officers elected: Chairman, H. S. 
Hower, of C. T. S.; Vice President,
H. S. Evans, Westinghouse Electric 
Co., and Secretary, J. C. Munds, of 
the General Electric Co. The officers 
of the General Society, including Mr. 
V. R. Lansligle, of New York, Presi-' 
dent, were present and conducteed the 
meeting. Among the members of the 
new branch are Allen Bright, J. A. 
Clark and M. R. Kennedy, all grad
uates of the Schools. Notice of the 
meetings of the society will be pub
lished in The Tartan and any students 
who may be interested are cordially 
invited to attend.
NEW ELECTRIC FURNACE.
The Metallurgical department of a 
new electric furnace of the Hercult 
type, the sketches for which were 
made by Prof. McIntosh and the fin
ished drawings by Mr. Milligan, as
sistant supervisor of Equipment. The 
furnaces has a capacity of about 500 
pounds of steel per heat, has a Al/t 
inch fire clay bottom sides of 4^2 inch 
magnetic chrome brick and a roof of 
silica brick. The purpose of the fur
nace is for studying special steels and 
reactions for removing phosphorous 
and sulphur by oxidation and reduc
tion. The furnace is charged with a
5 inch or 6 inch layer of iron which 
is covered with coke around the arcs, 
where calcium carbide and calcium 
sulphide are formed. There are two 
electrodes, 4 inches in diameter and 
made of graphite. These elecrodes 
are water-cooled, and require a cur
rent of about 100 amperes at 100 to 
150 volts.
The desired voltage is secured by a 
large oil-cooled 75 K. V. A. transform
er and a switchboard so arranged as 
to give close control of the voltage be
tween 30 and 300 in about forty 1 five 
steps.
---------o---------
THE WIRELESS STATION WILL 
BE IN THE NEW MA
CHINERY HALL.
Along with the new buildings, plans 
are being made for the installation of 
a wireless telegraph station here. A 
large steel pole will be erected for 
the aerial. Professor Hower, who is 
working on this, has not yet calcu
lated the necessary height, but it will 
be consideraole, in order to overcome 
the interference of the surrounding 
hills.
A five K. W. instrument will be 
used which will be capable of send
ing messages several hundred miles, 
probably to New York, Cleveland, 
Palm Beach, etc. This will be of con
siderable value to the school as it 
gives opportunity for practical work 
and for original research along these 
lines.
---------o---------
BASEBALL PROSPECTS.
The periods for baseball practice 
have been changed from Tuesday and 
Thursday, to Monday, Wednesday and 
Friday, at 4-5 oclock. The call for 
candidates has been enthusiastically 
responded to, nearly fifty having re
ported. This number is not as large 
as it should be, but the quality of ma
terial is excellent; the new men have 
shown such ability that the veterans 
will have to be on the jump to hold 
their old positions.
There is a large number of promis
ing candidates for all the infield posi
tions, except that of catcher.
The assistant manager is working 
on a schedule for the scrubs; this will 
give those who do not make regular 
varsity positions a chance to repre
sent the school in a number of good 
games.
Indications point to the develop
ment of a scrappy team that cannot 
help but win games.
PLEBE NOTES.

THISTLE GOES TO PRESS.
The dummy of the 1912 Thistle 
was taken to the printers on Friday, 
February 23, one week after all the 
material was due. Meeting of The 
Thistle Board were held Saturday, 
Monday and Wednesday evenings, and 
all day Thursday, so that by Friday 
morning the dummy was ready for 
the press.
In spite of all that was said and 
done, many people came with mate
rial after February 15th and were 
much peeved when they were told that 
they were too late.
Subscriptions to The Thistle have 
come in promptly, causing much grati
fication to the entire Board. Man
ager Siegle announces that 650 sub
scriptions upon which advance pay
ment has been made have been re
ceived by him, and that 70 to 75 peo
ple have promised to buy by signing 
the blanks, but have not made any 
deposit.
This number increased by the 22 
books given to The Thistle Board for 
attendance at 80 per cent of the meet
ings; and approximately 40 given to 
advertisers brings the total edition 
up to nearly 800 books.

J WHATS WHAT AND HOW. |
It is herewith made public for the 
first time on the eve of a great presi
dential spasm that there is a back 
to nature club in process of gesta
tion, begotten by certain amateur hay
seeds in the Faculty. Evolution seems 
to have weakened 011 its job and is 
allowing her latest product to coast 
down the slope toward the primitive. 
The high brows are beginning to 
lust after the hand-me-down culture 
of th man with the hoe.
To be sure nothing more seribus 
has developed than near-bucolic dis
cussions that sound like Jules Verne 
fiction with a dubious taste for fer
tilizers. The varied forms of refined 
and fantastic outrage they intend to 
perpetrate on innocent old mother 
earth would add a new and thrilling 
chapter to the Descent of Man.
In crashing chorus they clank the 
chains of effete urban civilization with 
which they are bound and take blood
curdling oaths to shed their bonds 
with a despatch, that will make the 
elusive Mr. Hudini look like a fourfiusher. The Anvil Chorus rehearses 
about five times a week.
They all have ideas, Oh, yes! but 
most of the ideas have the artistic 
temperament.
The versatile blue light is about 
to come into its own as a corrective 
for rheumatism in Bees and curvature 
of the spine in blackberry bushes. The 
club advocates the fertilization of 
beans with pepsin to prevent domes
tic infelicity between them and stom
achs with a boarding house diploma 
and a blighted future. Food experts 
tell us that beans are a sort of mil
lionaires among foods and they go 
thro the usual millionaire convultions, 
when separated from their wealth of 
nutriment. The club proposes a 
School of Philanthropy for these beleguminous rough necks, to develope 
a virtuous horror of dying rich and a 
more chivalrous attitude toward pro
fessorial digestions.
Mr. Bergey believes that if lady 
steers are confined in restricted bou
doirs with appropriate mottoes on the 
walls, and are taught to concentrate 
their minds by the Bergeyan method 
(all rights reserved) for intruding 
mathematics into the cerebral waste 
places of a man or animal, they will 
eventually yield condensed milk in 
sealed cans. He has also computed 
the moment of inertia of crop rota
tion and is prepared to utter burning 
words on the subject of higher edu
cation for soils.
The membership is a unit in pre
ferring the logarithmic to the San 
Jose scale for laying out orchards.
Tt is evident that the adjacent agri
cultural regions are billed, this sum
mer, for continuous back-to-the-soil 
vaudeville, w7ith standing room at a 
premium and nature throwing a fit 
in each act.
Fellow students would you consider | 
that day lost, whose low descend-1 
ing sun witnessed, with you on the | 
side lines of course, the spectacle of j 
one of your cherished professors at- j 
tempting to insert the light of rea- j 
son and a bucket of bran-mash into | 
a coquettish three months calf?
In all candor, would you rather be 
thrilled by a lecture on thermo
dynamics or be present (and unseen) 
at the delivery of an impromptu, but 
not on that account less impassioned 
address by another of your educa
tional stage managers, to th ehen with 
a term average of one egg per week, 
and an incubational flunk in the semi
annual exam with two offspring out 
of thirteen egg-questions?
Dont answer hastily. Think it over 
and come early to avoid the rush.
P. A. A. WINS FROM CRIPPLES.
The Pittsburgh Athletic Association 
team played the return basketball 
game at the Field House on Tuesday 
evening, February 20. The game was 
scheduled to start at 8 oclock, but 
was delayed until the visitors could 
hunt up enough men to fill ail of the 
five positions, which was accomplished 
by 9:15.
The first half was just fast enough 
to hold the interest of a small gath
ering of spectators. Neither team 
gave the other an opportunity to score 
except from the foul line until more 
than half of the first period had 
passed. With the score 3 to 2 against 
us, Hall shot the first field goal after 
twelve minutes had passed into his
tory. Capt. Williams scored on a 
pretty shot for the only other double 
score of the half. Wynn, who played 
a star game for the visitors, caged 
he ball for the only field goal for his 
team in the initial half, but made four 
more in the second period. Our boys 
ere not careful enough about fouling, 
and with Ralston shooting fouls, the 
half ended 9 to 6 against us.
The second half was more sensa
tional, and showed better work on 
the part of both teams. Towards the 
last our guards weakened somewhat 
Wynn and Beh were able to score 
oftener than they should.. Colvin per
formed wrell from the foul line in this 
half, scoring 8 out of 11 attempts. D. 
Williams, sent in for Heisel, made two 
good shots for two points each.
Considering that Colvin and Kesselmen were both in a crippled condition, 
the game was far from a poor one. 
P. A. A .,however, did not show the 
class which they exhibited in their first 
game.

A colored man was brought before 
a police judge charged with stealing 
chickens. He pleaded guilty, and re
ceived sentence, when the judge asked 
how it was he managed to lift those 
chickens right under the window of 
the owners house when there was a 
dog in the yard.
Hit wouldnt be of no use, Judge, 
said the man, to try to splain dis 
thing to you all. Ef you was to try 
it you like as not would get yer hide 
full o shot an get no chickens, nuther. Ef you want to engage in any 
rascality, Judge, yo better stick to 
de bench, whar yo am familiar.
