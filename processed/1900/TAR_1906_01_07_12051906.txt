ATHLETICS.
There is a discussion on at this 
writing relative to the awarding of 
the varsity C to the men who made 
the 1906 Football Team. It is being ar
gued by those who are members of the 
Athletic Association, and a great deal 
more by those who are not, with the 
result that the award hangs in the 
balance.
Some who are entirely without au
thority in the matter contend that the 
1906 eleven was merely a Freshmen 
team. I rembember on no occasion
1909 vs. 1911.
On Thanksgiving morning two 
teams representing respectively the 
day plebes and the night class of 1911, 
battled for supremacy on the school 
gridiron.
On first sight it was seen that the 
night men were somewhat handicap
ped in weight, and in the preliminary 
signal practic showed their lack of suf
ficient training.
Notwithstanding these handicaps 
the night boys determined to make a 
good showing though they had little

when it was advertised as such, and 
doubt if there were any games sched
uled under that name. I am quite sure 
that the Athletic Association would 
not have realized as much in guaran
tees from opponents if such were the 
case. The team was sent out as repre
sentative of the schools, as a varsity 
team, and there seems to be no logical 
reason why those men who stood up 
against inevitable defeat in the big 
games, and gave their best in playing 
off the schedule should not be thus 
honored.
Every man on the team is a firm be
liever in the policy of making a C 
worth something, realizing that when 
they are passed out promiscuously it 
immediately takes away their value 
as an incentive for the men to work. 
They believe also that if no recogni
tion is given the varsity men, neither 
a C or other emblem; that their very 
commendable work has not been ap(Continued on page 2.)
hope of victory.
Edwards for the night men won the 
toss and chose to defend the east 
goal. The ball was placed in the 
middle of the field and with a tingle 
of Fosters cow bell and an expectant 
yell from the 200 assembled rooters 
the game was on.
Edwards kicked off *to Dowling on 
the five-yard line. Wink had his in
terference made for him very quickly 
and started on a brilliant run which 
was the bright feature of the game, the 
seemed to spurn the ground beneath 
his feet and so eager was he that he 
outstripped his own interference be
fore the middle of the field was reach
ed. From there he kept on gaining 
speed at each bound, easily warding 
off would-be tacklers and pulled up be
hind the goal posts for the first points 
of the game, after but one minute and 
twenty seconds of actual play. Goal

Four organic divisions of athletics 
are comprised under this association:
First, School of Applied Science, 
with two sub-divisions, Day Students, 
Night Students.
Second, School of Apprentices and 
Journeymen, with two sub-divisions, 
Day Students, Night Students.
Third, School of Applied Design, 
with two sub-divisions, Day Students, 
Night Students.
Fourth, Margaret Morrison Carne
gie School for Women, with four sub
divisions: Technical Courses, Day
Students, Night Students. Trade 
Courses, Day Students, Night Students.
In order that the organic divisions 
may be conveniently distinguished it 
has been decided that each division 
shall adopt a color taken from the 
Carnegie Tartan as follows:
For the School of Applied Science, 
BLUE.
For School of Aprentices and Jour
neymen, GREEN.
For the School of Applied Design, 
RED.
For the Womens School, YELLOW.
And further in order that the separ
ate sub-divisions may have distinctive 
colors, it shall rest within the pro
vince of this association to approve of 
some shade of these colors to signify 
whether the student belongs to the 
Day or Night Course. - ,;

It has been arranged to have a rehersal of the school songs every 
Wednesday at 9.40 at the completion 
of Prof. Willets lecture. Mr. Dorrington of the Glee Club will lead.
Announcement has been made of the 
appointment of Mr. Robert Hill Greene 
to an instructorship of Mech Drawing 
in the school of Apprentices and Jour
neymen to succeed Mr. E. W. Shinn. 
He has had a host of experience, hav
ing taught at several Boston and Lynn 
schools as well as the Westinghouse 
school. He is at present employed at 
Westinghouse Electric Co.
The Tartan congratulates  the men 
who showed their school spirit in giv
ing some of their vacation time on the 
work, building the dam in the hollow 
behind school. If every man who has 
some little spare time would put it in 
work on this new project, he certainly 
would be amply repaid in enjoyment 
before winter is over.
Keep it up boys.
-----------o--------
EXAMS.
Examinations will be held from De
cember 10-14 inclusive for all depart
ments of the school. Now is the time 
to begin fellows. Remember the death 
line: 70%.
A learned man is one who knows 
everything but the obvious.
D. S. Munn was appointed an alter
nate to a cadetship at West Point re
cently and if the other fellow fails to 
qualify, Munn will undoubtedly be a 
cadet next year, as he has all the re
quisites of a soldier.
Tour Engstrpm. formerly of 1910, 
spent Thanksgiving Day at his home, 
in Wilkinsburg..
Engstrom is now employed by the 
Republic Iron and Steel Co., in Young
stown, and for this reason had to give 
up attending Tech.
Tour was a very popular student, 
and will be missed by all the 1910 
men, and- especially by Hockey and 
Basket Teams, on both of which he 
was. a tower of strength.
Sections A and B are very quiet, 
for we have not as yet received any
news from either. Whats the cause 
boys?
Anderson (to Prof. Wurts, in Elec
tricity.)I think I can tell them what 
they mean, Professor.
Prof. Wurts.'Alright, you are the 
man we are looking for.
Does any one ever notice that bunch 
of fellows, who walk westward on 
Forbes street, immediately after 
school, when they should take a car 
going east? What is the attraction?
The tickets for the 1911 smoker con
tain no reason why an admission fee 
is charged and suggest no object for 
which the affair is given, excepting for 
sociability sake. Last year 1910 gave 
two smokers, but distinctly stated that 
they were for the benefit for Athletic 
Association, which was badly in need 
of funds and while 1911 may mean all 
right, yet we think they, should at 
least name some organization in the 
school as a beneficiary besides the 1911 
Class.
The Mandolin Club has been sifted, 
and while the number of players have 
been decreased, yet the efficiency has 
been raised to a higher standard than 
that, of last year. A regular leader 
has been selected and rehearsals are 
held every Monday and Friday nights. 
If there are any players in the M. M. 
C. S. we would be glad to see them 
join the boys and make a combination 
club. What say you, girls? Let us 
assure you, the boys will be glad to 
see you safely home after rehearsals.
----------o-----------
THE NEW NATATOR1UM 
BUILDING.
Owing to frequent inquires amongst 
the student body regarding aquatic 
sports it might not be out of place to 
mention the Natatorium being erected 
on Forbes street, opposite the Postoffice in Oakland.
The building will be of beautiful 
white terra cotta, four stories high 
and entirely constructed of s-teel. The 
basement will contain- the swimming 
pool. This will be the largest and best 
equipped in the city with chutes, 
spring-boards, rings, trapezes, etc. 
Expert swimming instructors will be 
on hand every day for use of begin
ners. Extraordinary precautions will 
be taken to make it one of the clean
est and most sanitary natatoriums in 
the world.
The first floor will be equipped with 
the most approved type of bowling al
leys, with separate ones for women 
and children.
The second floor will be utilized as 
billiard and pool rooms; and the third 
floor, as a dancing school: while the 
fourth floor will be devoted to lodge 
rooms.
With such men at the head of this 
enterprise as James .1. Booth, C. B. 
Aylesworth, and Graham P. Jackson, 
it is certain that this immense amuse
ment place will be conducted in such 
a way that it will deserve the patron
age of all Tech students.
1909 vs. 1911.
(Continued from page one.) 
was missed. Score: Day 5, 1911 0.
The day kicked off to the nights and 
the ball was returned about twelve 
yards when the runner was brought 
down. In two downs the night men 
made eight yards and Edwards punted 
about thirty yards. The ball was run 
back about five yards and the day men 
were held for downs in the subsequent 
scirmmages. The ball was in the prosession of the night men in the mid
dle of the field. The night men failed 
to gain materially in two downs and 
a forward pass was tried. Owing to 
a fault in the execution of the play 
a penalty was inflicted *to the extent 
of fifteen yards. The ball in the pos
session of the day team and an end 
run by Dowling pinched the second 
touch down. He might have been 
brought down but the night men were 
a little off in the theory of tackling. 
The goal was missed and the score 
stood 10 to 0 in favor of the plebes
During the remainder of the half the 
ball surged up and down the field pro
pelled by trick plays toward the night 
mens goal but booted out of danger 
by Edwards clever toe.
The remarkable feature of the half 
was the grit displayed by the night 
line and the aggressiveness of the 
back field.
Twice during the half were the 
heavy day men held for downs. The 
night boys several of whom never fig
ured in any football game acquitted 
themselves nobly and they played with 
a spirit which is indicative of some 
surprises which may be sprung in the 
annals of football lore.
The second half was an exhibition 
of football the like of which surpassed 
even the players themselves. It was 
with great determination that the ri
vals played each other and it was only 
with great difficulty that a third 
touch down was made by the day men. 
The night men had a chance to score, 
but the attempt at a field goal failed 
and with that the hope of' a scorce for 
the plucky night men waned.
There were some few changes in the 
line-up but they were not for reasons 
of incompetence on the part of the 
men replaced but rather to give the 
subs a taste of blood.
To single out any one of the contest
ing teams for special mention would 
be an injustice to all his team mates 
as each man played the game and the 
result was a victory of weight and ex
perience over pluck and grit.
The presence of a number of ladies 
wearing the blue and white of 1911 
would explain, perhaps not a little of 
the good showing of the night men.
The day men are to be congratulat
ed on the dimfnsions of their splendid 
victory, and as it was won by the em
ployment of only geutlemenly and 
sportmanlike tactics Capt. Newell and 
his braves feel-less keenly the sting of 
defeat. .

THE SLIDE RULEWITH EXERCISES FOR BEGINNERS.
(Part 2, publisher! in last weeks number, contained methods of multipli
cation and division by the Slide Rule.)
MULTIPLICATION OR DIVISION BY A CONSTANT FACTOR.The
slide rule is especially adapted to multiplying a serines of numbers by the 
same factor. Only one setting of the slire is necessary, then the result of 
each multiplication can be read off at onee. For example to multiply 24, 
36 and 48 by .707, set 1 on B scale to .707 and then read the various results 
opposite the number 24, 36 and 48. In the form of a diagram already used.
R .707 
set 1
resultresult
over 36over 48
It is usually best, to save the eyes, to move the runner to the numbers 24, 
36, etc., when reading off the results on the upper scale.
Division by a- constant factor is likewise done by one setting of the 
slide. Divide 1 by the divisor and multiply the various factors by the result. 
For example to divide 24, 36 and 48 by .707, set the slide as shown by the 
following diagram.
A | at 1 | result | result | result
Bset .707over 24 ! over 36over 48
The numbers 24, 36 and 48 have been multiplied by 1 divided by .707 
which is equivalent to dividing by .707.
Exercise 8.
Fill in the numbers in columns 2 and 3, as directed, using the A, B, scales, 
and doing one column at a time.

for the fourteen calculations is 4 minutes. But if each number is first 
multiplied by 1.41 and then divided by 2.75, the time required is 6 minutes.
PART III
SQUARES AND SQUARE ROOTS.The upper scales of the slide rule 
are half the length of the lower scales, and are repeated. Owing to the 
increased length, the upper scales are more convenient for multiplying.
The position of the upper scales leads to another important property, 
the numbers are squares of the corresponding numbers on the lower scales. 
This is easily verified by integers 2, 3, .etc., on the lower scale, whose squares 
are known. By use of the runner the square of any number can be read off, 
as shown in Fig. 8. Either the A, D scales or the C, B scales can be used.

1911.
The committee 'delegated to inter
view Miss Smith of the M. M. C. 
School found the conditions unfavora
ble and the facilities inadequate for 
the holding of dances, so the 1911 
class dance was dropped for the pres
ent.
It is hinted that social affairs will 
be reduced to a minimum until the 
girls are permanently located on 
Woodlawn avenue.
With regard to the reducing of social 
affairs, the social committee would 
like to call attention to the difference 
between social and stag affairs. The 
smoker held on December 3d was a 
hummer and the committee in 
charge is deserving of great praise 
and congratulation on its success. A 
detailed report of the doings will be 
published next week in order to show 
those who did not attend what they 
missed.
The 1911 football team by practicing 
diligently every evening after school 
certainly proved the earnestness of 
their challenge, and this accounts for 
their good showing in Thursdays 
game. The game has been sarcas
tically referred to as a foot-ball farce, 
but when one considers the difficulties 
under which the night men labored 
the grade of foot-ball exhibited was 
really brilliant. The line-up and de
tailed account of the game will appear 
in another column of this issue, writ
ten by a special class representative 
on the ground.
There is one field in which 1911 
shows a decided lack of interest. That 
is the matter of contributing to the 
Tartan. Of the eight sections, each 
of which had a reporter, there has 
been but one contribution. That was 
a personal of doubtful quality, but was 
sent through because it was the first 
and only contribution. Get busy and 
let us all laugh at your jokes by send
ing them into the Tartan and having 
them perpetuated.
It is a rather peculiar order of pro
cedure to decide to have a smoker, 
get tickets printed and then put on 
sale, engage talent and finally ask per
mission of the director. Hess thought 
it was all right.
Is that the simplest way in which 
that result may be obtained? Hpupil.
Prof. (in Algebra)Yes.
PupilWould the slide rule give 
it close enough?

Fig. 8. Squares.
Square roots are found by reversing the operation of squaring the num
ber. Some ambiguity may arise because any number can be found twice on 
the upper scale, therefore two square roots may be found. A real difficulty 
arises here, namely, that the decimal point must be taken account of in ex
tracting square roots. A simple rule can be given, based upon the logarithmic 
characteristic.
If the logarithmic characteristic is even, choose the number on the left 
side of scale: if odd, choose the number on the right side. This rule is also 
given in the form of a diagram, Fig. 9.

Fig. 9. Square Roots.
As an example, the number 4 has a log, characteristic zero (which is con
sidered even) and its square root 2 is found under 4 on the left side of the 
scale. While the number 40 (log characteristic odd) has its square root 6.32 
on the right side.
% Further, any square may be used as a factor in multiplication or division, 
by combining the upper and lower scales. This is best shown by an example.

Note that when any number is taken from the C scale, the result is the 
same as the square on the B scale. Hence it is practically just as easy to use 
the square as the number itself.
A useful application is found in the areas of circles, which may be ex
pressed Area  .785 D2. The diagram is shown in Fig. 10.

In a similar manner any square root may be used as a factor in multipli
cation or division. The work must be done on the two lower scales, in combi
nation with one of the upper, as shown bv the following example:
31 X V 62 X V 3.49

When using the C, D scales, any number on the B scale may be employed 
(which is equivalent to the square root of the number) for the various factors. 
It is thus nearly as easy to use the square root of a number as the number 
itself, in any fraction. Care must be taken, however, to choose the proper 
half of the B scale as -was explained in Fig. 9. In the above diagram the 
word right or left, is added to the numbers on B scale to denote which end 
was taken.
The class of 1911 Applied Science, lin Club rendered several selections 
held their first smoker on last Mon- and recitations were given by Messrs. 
day night. Quite a large number at- Edwards and Densmore. A royal good 
tended, conspicuous among which time was the vercUct of alL 
were several 1910 men. The MandoOn the Tuesday before Thanksgiving 
Day the much-talked-of game between 
the Electricals and the Medicals took 
place. The teams were fairly match
ed, the Electricals having a little ad
vantage due to their practice, which 
had been held nearly every day for 
two weeks before the game. R. G. 
Knoll, center for the Electricals, was 
not in the game, owing to the fact 
that he was sent to Sharpsburg to get 
some oysters, on which the Electricals 
were going to banquet in honor of 
their victory. Palmer, a former star 
of the All-McKees Rocks team, was 
given the position and played a fine 
game, except for his passing. Weick, 
the giant human lighthouse, held his 
position as right guard in good style, 
often breaking through the opposing 
line and tackeling the runners for a 
loss. The line bucking of Jo-Jo, the 
Bear Eater, was a much-talked-of 
feature, also the head work of Slocum. 
Ramp, the Varsity fullback, was given 
the ball for a gain nearly every time; 
his charges were fierce and powerful, 
requiring eight stall-fed men to stop 
them. It is rumored that he had 
money on the Electricals.
About the score: Oh! I almost for
got that. It was 50. Yes. You see 
it was this way. Colmery, the husky 
halfback of the Electricals, had the. pig 
skin neatly folded away under his 
arm in the most approved style when 
some one touched his left ear, and the 
ball rolled gaily away oer the muddy 
slush. Martin, the bearing quarter 
for the Mechanicals, pounced upon it 
like a hawk and was away for a touch
down, with the also-rans clattering 
after. The run was about sixty- yards 
in length, or, no, I guess it was sev
enty. I almost forgot to mention the 
great playing of Thurston, the Dixie 
led from Richmond, Va., or that of 
Garber, the Mechanicals center, whose 
passes never missed the mark. The 
betting was fast and furious, the odds 
being 2 to 1 on the Electricals. A 
noted plunger, A. T. Rahal, was pres
ent at the ceremonies, and is reported 
to have won sixty cents. Burnside 
and Espy went home in disgust. The

The C class is progressing and 
deep questions are the order of the 
day. Miss Connelly would like to know 
how to make the holes in Switzer 
cheese.
Dr. EatonMy oldest son has every 
hair straighter than the other one.
Miss Watson never likes to omit her 
gs, and in speaking to our hygienne 
instructor addresses him as Dr. Eat
ing.
As yet we the T. P. C. have seen 
no evidence of the Eatons lectures 
and the physical development of 
women has as yet taken no effect in 
the A. C. & D. divisions. Some of our 
girls held that the gentle breezes and 
soft summer rains of last Monday, 
would ruin their health (rather your 
complexions). However, when we 
have given them time to grasp the fact 
that the more outdoor exercise one 
gets in all sorts of weather the better 
it is for one and ones complexion too, 
then we may expect a few representa
tives from their classes. If some of 
the girls knew what we did last Mon
day they would not be absent next 
Monday. If you are curious ask Miss 
Smith.
Girls, the Glee Club would like more 
members. We surely would want to 
make a fine shewing if we were to give
an entertainment, and with so many 
to choose from there ought to be more 
representatives. It doesnt take so 
much of your valuable time that you 
cant come and under our able in
structor, you could help but learn 
to sing.
No matter what time passes the M. 
M. C. S. they would hear sweet strains 
issuing from the building. Dancing 
seems to be a pleasant diversion from 
our studies. We think so, dont we, 
girls?
It was a sad day for Anne when 
her dear friend Mike disappeared from 
school. We hope a substitute will 
soon be found, one who can at least 
partially fill the empty spot in her 
affections.
Thanksgiving greetings were sent 
to little Margaret Carnegie, wishing
