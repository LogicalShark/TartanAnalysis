lege Dual Meet, New Wilmington.
Mon., June 9: Dual Meet, Penn
State, State College.
The above list of events makes up 
one of the most interesting track 
schedules that have ever been ar
ranged for Carnegie Tech athletes. 
The first three meets are those calcu
lated to arouse interest in the schools 
and to allow the students to learn 
how good the aspiring candidates for 
the Varsity are: the later contests in
clude the best of the collegiate track 
teams of Western Pennsylvania and 
will establish our standing in this dis
trict; while the Pennsylvania relay 
races will show a comparison with the 
best athletes of the country.
Manager Parry, whose election was 
confirmed at a recent meeting of the 
Board of Control, deserves credit for 
the arrangement of the games. With 
the student interest usual to the 
schools the season should be as suc
cessful as in previous years, in points 
scored and in athletic advertisement.
The first meet will be held next 
Wednesday afternoon on the stadium 
field. The three upper classes in the 
Civil Engineering Department of the 
School of Applied Science will com
pete for the second time for the cup 
donated by Prof. Mott. This con
test brings out the born athletes, those 
who have unwittingly been hiding 
their candle under the drawing board, 
and offers all kinds of enjoyment to 
the spectators as well as to the com
petitors. The Juniors claim to have 
the best team this year, but the Sen
iors are not willing to give any credit 
to underclassmen until after the con
test. The Sophs are the dark horses, 
as they have the largest number of 
untried athletes who aim to earn 
undying fame for their class.
The following week will include two 
of the most interesting competitions 
of the year one on Wednesday and 
the other on Saturday. Entry lists 
for the Inter-school meet will be
THISTLE.
Fi st Lot of Books Expected May 1st.
All the copy for the Thistle has 
been with the printer for more than 
15 days and the first shipment of 
books is expected May 1st. From 
every standpoint we feel that we are 
going to publish an exceptional book 
this year and if nothing unexpected 
happens the delivery will be made on 
time.
The Thistle Board has extended the 
time for the procuring of receipts in 
order to accommodate those who do 
not yet have them. If you happen to 
be one of these unfortunate persons, 
the advice of the Board is: that you 
lose no time in making your purchase. 
The supply of books is limited and the 
student who comes to the office on 
the day of delivery and presents a re
ceipt will be the one who receives a 
book.
It is surely impossible to conceive 
that any one would pass up the chance 
to procure the 1913 Thistle, bound in 
leather, for the small sum of $2.00. 
We will only allow the receipts to be 
sold for a short time yet and it is 
necessary that you should procure 
one, if you have not already done so, 
at the first opportunity. The usual 
representative will accommodate you.
MECHANICALS MAKE TEST.
Last Friday the Senior Mechanicals 
participated in making a test on an 
engine driving a 40-inch mill in the 
Duquesne Works of the Carnegie 
Steel Co.
Mr. Sieber, of Carnegie Steel Co., 
had charge of the test. Considerable 
value was attached to being able to 
see such a test and likewise to take 
part in it.
Professor Hiram Bingham, head 
archaeologist at Yale, who has lately 
returned from an expedition to Peru, 
sent out under the joint auspices of 
Yale University and the National Geo
graphical Society, announces the ex
ploration of a wondrous and fallen 
pre-Incan city in Peru, with edifices 
of chiseled marble and numberless 
skeletons of phehistoric eras.
opened this week, and the men will 
be put into training immediately. The 
number of contestants will be unus
ually large and each of the three 
schools will fight hard for first place.
The management issues an urgent 
call for all weight and discus men. 
Candidates should report at once to 
start practice. v
ONE WEEK MORE,
THEN PLAY BALL.
Line-Up Still in the Air.
During the past two weeks the base
ball squad has been fortunate enough 
to be able to do considerable out-door 
work. A number of three-to-five-inning games have been played, and bat
ting and fielding practice have been 
indulged in often enough to give the 
coaches a good idea of the relative 
merits of the candidates. Sore arms 
are still rather common, especially 
among the embryo pitchers, but the 
boys are not allowed to over-strain 
their wings, and will rapidly come in
to shape. With a few more skirmish
es in the open, the entire squad should 
be in shape to last a full nine-inning 
game.
While this years team will contain 
a number of last years men, it is possit-e that the line-up will be quite 
different from that of the former sea
son. Owing to a shortage in catchers, 
Bill Moorhead, former captain and 
first basemen, is being tried out be
hind the bat. Lobert, a brother of the 
Philadelphia National Leaguer, is 
among the candidates for first stationmaster, and looks good. Captain 
Gearhart will probably hold down his 
old job in Wagnerville, but the other 
positions are very much unsettled. 
The pitching squad contains many 
likely-looking youngsters, the best of 
which, so far, are Urquhart and Hines.
First Assistant Manager Routh has 
arranged an interesting schedule for 
the second team, and, while he is not 
ieady to publish it, says that it con
tains the best of local secondary 
schools of the district. This means 
that the second team will have to be 
as good as the Varsity in order to 
keep up the reputation of the Insti
tute, for many of the Prep schools 
have better baseball teams than the 
colleges. On this account, the man
agement is anxious to see the size 
of the squad increase. There is plenty 
of room yet on the Varsity for new 
men, as well as on the second team. 
Catchers will be especially welcomed, 
if not with a band, at least with open 
arms.
The opening game is only a week 
away, for the curtain goes up on Sat
urday, April 12. Duquesne University 
will play the opening attraction, and, 
recalling last years series, nine in
nings of thrills are promised. It is 
up to the students to show that we 
can support baseball in Tech just as 
loyally as we have done football, but 
that means the stands must be filled. 
In order to give you fair warning we 
start a week ahead with that old cry, 
Get out and show some spirit!
VIVA LE STUDENT SENATE!
Student Senate Vindicated.
The Student Senate of the School of 
Applied Industries was completely 
vindicated as a disciplinary body last 
Friday evening. The story runs that 
four students were hauled before this 
august body on March 12th for gross 
misbehavior in one of the laboratories. 
After due deliberation sentence was 
pronounced, two of the culprits 
abided thereby, another avoided it on 
a technicality, and the fourth denying 
the authority of the Student Senate, 
had to be shown. Accordingly in view 
of about fifty students he was rushed 
to the perennial (?) springthe Forge 
water tank and in good plain Eng
lish ducked.
The sequel appeared last Tuesday 
when a portly constable from a down
town aldermans office came on the 
scene with documents reading, The
Commonwealth versus Mr.......... and
four members of the Student Senate 
found themselves facing an assault 
and battery charge. The matter was 
kept pretty secret, but it is a known 
fact that the men were dickering with 
the Deans Assistant to furnish them 
with school-work while serving their 
sentencea la Leavenworth.
The hearing was set for last Friday 
evening and but three of the defend
ants put in an appearance, the fourth 
being hindered by reason of the high 
water. The room of justice was 
crowded to the doors but not with 
students, the secret had been too care
fully guarded. The denizens of the 
Hill district were there, including a 
goodly number of the colored breth
ren and of the Elect race, making 
a superb setting. The plaintiff stated 
his case, and even the big policeman 
who guarded the rail of justice smiled. 
Our three were then duly sworn ir 
and the huskiest one of the trio re
cited his version of the case. The 
smile of the policeman changed to a 
grin, it became contagious the au
dience took it up, the portly constable 
had a merry twinkle in his eye, the 
alderman's clerk could not compose 
himself and the alderman could not 
help himself but show that he appre
ciated the humor of the situation.
So, to make a long story short, our 
three were discharged with honors, 
the plaintiff was severely lectured and 
soundly advised by the alderman and 
even the colored attorney, who at first 
volunteered his advice to the prose
cutor. wound up by giving him an il
luminating lecture on college ethics. 
Thus was the Student Senate vindi
cated. Long Live the Student Sen
ate!

The Tartan has had sent it by Di
rector McCulloch, a newspaper clip
ping and a poster of a basketball game 
played by a non-representative team 
of Carnegie and the town team of St. 
Marys, Pa. The question of a few 
students getting together and calling 
themselves the Carnegie Tech Col
legians or the Carnegie Tech team 
has come up before and the Athletic 
Association has done what it can to 
stop this practice. Apparently the at
titude of the athletic authorities has 
had no effect, as is witnessed by theposter and clipping sent The Tartan.
The poster is as follows: 
TONIGHT 
March 19th 
BASKET BALL 
At the Lyceum 
CARNEGIE TECH 
of Pittsburgh 
VS
ST. MARYS 
Admission, 15c. and 25c.
The clipping is as follows:
ST. MARYS WIN
OVER CARNEGIE TECH
COLLEGIANS, 65 TO 12.
The management of the basketball 
team feels like apologizing to the 
patrons of the game, for the fiasco 
of a game played at the Lyceum last 
night. We were as badly disappointed 
in the outcome of the game as the 
spectators must have been, for while 
we expected to win, yet we at least 
hoped to be forced to play a little 
basketball...............
After giving a few details of the 
game, comes the line-up, Crow, Web
er, Moon, M. Buck and McClure, beng the names listed under Carnegie 
Tech.
The general student-body will easily
see that such a thing reflects no credit 
upon our Alma Mater, and will readily 
agree that such practice should be put 
a stop to. It is against all the prin
ciples of the Athletic Constitution to 
allow any group of students to form 
on their own initiative a team and 
play games under the School name. 
Since the efforts of the Athletic Asso
ciation to put a stop to the practice 
have been unavailing, it is up to the 
student body as a whole to take a 
hand in the matter and prevent any 
more teams repeating the performance 
of the Tech Collegians outlined 
above. The student body can easily 
shut down on the matter if they will, 
and they should do so at once. Men 
playing on such teams must be so 
thoroughly without the Carnegie 
spirit that they are unfit to be mem
bers of the institution or represent 
her on any of her Varsity teams. The 
Tartan would like to see the studentbody and the Athletic Association 
take such action as would debar men 
playing on these trumped-up teams 
from participating in any student ac
tivity whatsoever.
A petition has recently been circu
lated among members of the Faculty 
and student body by members of The 
White Friars for the purpose of rais
ing sufficient money to pay off the 
debts incurred in the production of 
last years show. It is necessary, we 
understand, for The White Friars to 
pay off all outstanding obligations 
before the Student Activity Commit
tee will sanction the production of an
other show.
Considerable question has been 
raised, however, about the circulation 
of this petition under the present cir
cumstances, and it has been brought 
to the attention of the Tartan by stu
dents who have been requested to 
sign. We supported the show last 
spring. say these students, and we 
are willing to again help The White 
Friars, but we want to know why it 
is necessary to help and where our 
money is going to. And they are 
quite right in their contention that 
they have the right to know wherein 
The Friars lost money last year and 
where the money contributed at this 
time is going. They should be given 
more information concerning The 
White Friars.condition than the mere 
statement that the organization needs 
two hundred dollars with which to 
pay off back debts. They should be 
given the opportunity to examine the 
books of the club through an auditing 
committee, the statement of the clubs 
condition to be made known to all. 
The logical committee to audit the 
books of The White Friars is the au
diting committee of the Student Acti
vity Fund, which consists of one student 
from each of the three schools, none of 
whom, we believe, haooens to be a mem
ber of the club. In this way all will krow 
exactly why they are contributing and for 
what purpose the money is to be spent.
The students will remember that 
some little time ago there appeared 
an article stating that a code of street 
car ethics was adopted by the stu
dents that forbid any of them to occu
py a seat while a woman was stand
ing. This code had long been an un
written and unspoken one but it was 
not noticed by the Pittsburgh press 
until the article referred to appeared, 
upon which we received much favor
able comment and praise. Now comes 
an article and editorial in the Pitts
burgh Sun, embodied in which is a 
letter from some woman unknown, 
who states that she can truthfully 
say that I see dozens of Tech boys 
sitting in the street cars on every 
morning while women stand.
It does not seem to us quite fair that 
the statement of one person should be so 
unqualifiedly accepted. As a matter of fact, 
we are delivering the goods all the time, 
as any qualified observer will admit. The 
woman making the statement given above 
may not be able to recognize Tech 
men when she sees them. We do not 
question her honesty in making her 
statement but we do question her gen
eralization. Carnegie Tech men have 
a habit of living up to the standards 
they set for themselves and they have 
not failed to do so in the present case. 
If the testimony of persons qualified to 
testify to the facts in the case is accepted 
all must admit the Carnegie men are 
living up to their self-imposed code 
of street car ethics.
At the special meeting of the Board 
of Control of the Athletic Associa
tion, held a week ago last night, Mr. 
N. G. Parry was elected Manager of 
the Track Team for the balance of the 
present season. The Tartan desires 
to congratulate Mr. Parry on his elec
tion and to wish to the Track Team 
the best of successes under Mr. Par
rys managership. The Tartan trusts 
that the prospects for the season have 
not been impaired seriously by the un
avoidable change in managers and the 
delay attendant thereto, and that the 
team and its new manager may pro
ceed harmoniously to the successful 
season to which we have all looked 
forward.

PUT COLLEGE MEN 
ON BATTLESHIPS
Undergraduates to Be Given Practical Preliminary Naval Training.
Cambridge, Mass., Feb. 28.Some 
details of the plans for placing col
lege undergraduates on battleships 
and cruisers of the United States 
Navy during the summer months were 
announced here today by Capt. C. C. 
Marsh, United States Navy. Captain 
Marsh and President Lowell of Har
vard have been among the prime mov
ers for the idea. Twenty men is the 
number proposed as the student rep
resentation in each battleship crew. 
Battleships are to be divided into two 
fleets, cruising between Portland, 
Me., and New York from the middle 
of July until the fall maneuvers are 
completed in September. Part of the 
time the two fleets are to engage in 
mimic warfare, affording a new op
portunity for a display of collegiate 
rivalry.
Instruction is to be given in en
gineering, gunnery and navigation, 
placing mines, handling boats and 
other details of a seamans life. The 
collegians will be- quartered away 
from the rest of the crew.
SHOW SOME SCHOOL SPIRIT.
There are other means of manifest
ing ones school spirit than by rooting 
at an athletic contest. One of these 
methods is the creating of a favorable 
impression of Tech in ones home 
town. The Easter vacation will af
ford the last opportunity this term 
for most of the students to return 
home, and it is urged, therefore, that 
every one put forth a special effort 
to interest the seniors in the high 
school from which he graduated, in 
Carnegie Tech. Tell them of the ad
vantages offered here and persuade 
them to matriculate at Tech next fall. 
A personal appeal will be made to all 
members of the Science School and 
printed cards, to be filled out by pros
pective students, will be distributed to 
all undergraduates going home. The 
Plebes especially should give this their 
attention. Let every person consider 
himself a committee of one to pro
cure new students. If each one will 
do his share, he will greatly facilitate 
the work of the general committee 
that has the matter in charge and 
he will, besides, be doing something 
for his school.
Desirable Assignment.
Is your town doing anything in the 
uplift way?
Oh, yes! We have a committee ap
pointed to see all shows suspected of 
being immoral and report on them. 
Good !
Yes. a committee of one thousand. 
Indeed! Isnt that aerrather 
large committee?
Well you see, we couldn't afford to 
create any hard feeling, and so we made 
it large enough to include about every
body.Lippincotts.

Association, Springfield, Mass., Decem

public is discontented with excessive 
challenging and excessive excusing from 
office in the selection of juries. (2) 
That the contentious attitude of counsel 
in a law-suit, and the attitude of the 
judge as the umpire of the game, has 
discredited the administration of jus

the professions of the engineer, the 
chemist, the physician, etc., should ap
pear in court only as impartial exposi
tors of scientific truth, not as paid plead

third degree as a shocking abuse. (5) 
That the public is suspicious of the mul

with which new trials are granted; and 
that it complains of the postponement of

With the memory of the Titanic 
disaster still in our minds, there has 
occurred about one year later, another 
water disaster, which in its destructive 
nature was much worse that that 
which took place on the ocean. The 
entire eastern central portion, of the 
country has been affected. Hundreds 
of thousands of people have been ren
dered homeless, while five hundred 
would be a conservative estimate of 
the number drowned. The most havoc 
has been wrought in Ohio. The recent 
incessant rains caused the bursting of 
the large reservoir near Dayton, the 
waters of which swept down the Mi
ami River Valley, leaving in their wake 
nothing but ruin. Millions of dollars 
worth of property has been destroyed. 
All communication with the flooded 
cities was cut off. For more than 
three days the telegraph and tele
phone wires were down and the train 
service had to be discontinued. In 
the central part of Dayton, the high 
water mark reached nine feet.
It is difficult to picture the existing 
conditions or to realize the mental 
state of the marooned inhabitants, un
less one has undergone a similar ex
perience. Rendered homeless, with 
fires raging for a time, and with star
vation staring them in the face, they 
appealed to their fellow statesmen for 
aid. As is always the case during 
such a crisis the neighboring unaf
fected people generously responded. 
Money was raised and provisions and 
clothing were sent as soon as possible. 
Pittsburgh, among many others, con
tributed its share. A large fund was 
collected here and a reserve ship laden 
with supplies was sent by the Cham
ber of Commerce down the Ohio to 
aid the sufferers in the towns along 
the river. It is interesting to us to 
know that the wireless telegraph ap
paratus on board the boat was fur
nished by Tech and that the three 
operatorsG. W. Fagan, G. A. Kauf
man, and F. M. Potterare Tech 
students. The undertakings of these 
men are not new for they have al
ready proved their ability to send mes
sages through and take them from the 
air.

MEN WANTED.
With an idea of filling a long-felt 
want in the schools, the Athletic As
sociation has decided to employ a 
student press representative to see 
that all sports in the institution re
ceive recognition from the daily press. 
The position will carry enough re
muneration with it to make it worth 
while for any student with the abilty to spend the time required. This 
will be approximately twenty-five dol
lars ($25) a month, and will continue 
throughout the school year. A com
petition will be held among the can
didates, who should hand their names 
to a member of the committee before 
Tuesday, April 15. Detailed information 
will be given any applicant by the

THE TENNIS DANCE.
Informal Hop Friday Eve.
The management of the Tennis 
team held an informal dance at the 
gym. last Friday evening, the pro
ceeds to be used for their season about 
to open. The 50 couples present en
joyed the program of twenty dances 
to the fullest extent. Most excellent 
music was furnished by Gilgs Or
chestra. The program was conspicu
ous by the number of schottisches and 
the cards were quite unique,' the 
dances being named in true tennis 
style, such as Ready, Serve, Sin
gle, Double, Your Ad, Game, 
etc. Dancing was continued until 12 
oclock and the committee in charge 
provided lunch in plentiful amount all 
evening. Financially, however, the 
dance was not all that could be de
sired. A great effort is being made 
by those interested in tennis, both 
faculty and students, to have several 
new tennis courts buiit, and we sin
cerely hope that the student body will 
co-operate more heartily with any fu
ture moves to help develop tennis.
BIG CARNIVAL COMING.
The Athletic Association in contin
uing its series of social events of the 
winter is making arrangements for a 
monster indoor carnival and circus 
to be held in the Field House the 
evening before Founders Day, April 
20. The program is to be varied and 
entertainment for all ages, classes and 
conditions is promised. As only local 
talent will be used, anybody with a 
stunt is invited to give a private ex
hibition to Supervisor McCulloch and 
join th merry merries. Full details 
will be announced as soon as plans 
are finished, but you can ask the girl 
and save the date. The entertainment
BASKETBALL PLAYERS RE
WARDED.
At a recent meeting of the Execu
tive Committee of the Athletic Asso
ciation the following men were 
awarded the Varsity basketball let
ter: Capt. R. W. P. Colvin, W. T.
Criswell, W. J. Heisel, J. P. Tumpane 
C. B. Metheny, A. S. Hines, and Man
ager W. J. Corbett. All of the men 
were well within the limits in regard 
to the number of games played as 
imposed by the Association constitu
tion. and were the players responsible 
for the success of the team.
PLUCKED FROM THE CIRCUM
AMBIENT.
The oppressive silence in the matter 
of wireless news from Fagan and 
Kaufman who accompanied the relief 
steamer Admiral Dewey, taking with 
them their wireless outfit, their old 
clothes and a package of chewing gum, 
has been broken by the receipt of 
only one message, for the authenticity 
of which we cannot vouch, however. 
It reads thus: C. I. T., G. I. T.cant 
touch bot-m or would jump of; fraid

BASEBALL SQUAD
GETS OUTSIDE.
The baseball squad took advantage 
of the warm weather last week to 
practice outside. Three games were 
played between two sections, each 
running five innings. About twentyfive men were used in the contests, 
and the new men given the best work
out. Coaches Marks and McCulloch 
are very well pleased with the ap
pearance of the team, and are will
ing to make predictions for the sea
son. The pitching staff is especially 
encouraging, including a number of 
promising men, and several veterans 
such as Urquhart. The first sched
uled game is but two weeks away, 
and the men are anxious to get into 
condition for a real contest. It is to 
be hoped that the warm weather will
continue, and that the diamond will
dry out as nicely as during last week.

COLLEGE MEN IN THE NAVY
Captain C. E. Marsh. U. S. N., has 
made public the details of the plan 
for giving a number of college under
graduates an opportunity to take a 
summer cruise on some of the navy 
vessels and thus to familiarize them
selves with life on board ship and fit 
themselves to become members of a 
sort of naval reserve.
The proposed trip will be taken on 
either battleships or cruisers and will 
last from about the middle of July to 
the middle of September. The cruise 
will give the men who take it an op
portunity to obtain practical instruc
tion in engineering, gunnery, naviga
tion, and an insight into the general 
routine of shipboard life and some of 
the problems now confronting the 
navy.
The ships will rendezvous at some 
New England port and will be divided 
into two fleets for mimic warfare. The 
first weeks will be spent cruising 
about from Portland, Me., to New 
York. When the boats are at anchor 
the men will learn to lay mines, handle 
the boats, and overhaul the machinery. 
The college students will be assigned 
in squads of 20 to each ship, and as far 
as possible men from the same college 
will be kept together. Only men who 
shall have completed two years of the 
regular college course will be taken.
Until an appropriation can be ob
tained from the Navy Department, the 
expenses of the cruise will be borne 
by the men who take it. The cost will 
be small.
The old system of using a heated 
iron and dirty cloth presFfs the grime 
and dirt into your garments. Our 
sanitary machine steams it all out, and 
removes permanently the dirt, pers
piration, odor and grime. See Shu
