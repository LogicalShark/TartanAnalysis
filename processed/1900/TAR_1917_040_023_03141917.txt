BASKETBALL TEAM WINBS IIP SEASON; BEFEATS BUFFALO BUT LBSES TO PITT
Abrams and Lubic Battle for' New Yorkers Are Unable to 
Supremacy at Foul Stand the Fire of Tech
Shooting Quintet
GYM. OVERCROWDED FOUL SHOOTING POOR
Tlie plaid followers were again 
forced to accept the irony of fate 
which seems to follow them when
ever the clash at hand includes the 
blue and gold. Yes, we may say 
irony of fate! For what else was 
it? To admit that the aggregation 
from across the dit^ch had anything 
on the plaid tossers is going too far 
 out of the way. Fight was the key
note of the entire escapade, some
times even resembling a football 
game where we could even see De 
Hart and Nig Finlay actually in 
action at a close-up view. Never 
was there a game played on the 
Tech floor where such a nip and 
tuck process prevailed throughout. 
Not until the final two minutes of 
play were reached was there any as
surance given Pitt tliat they could 
have the game. Clevor foul-shooting 
by both Lubic for Pitt and Abrams 
for Tech kept the crowd constantly 
on edge.
Long before the preliminary game 
was under way the gym was crowd
ed with a great mass of Pitt and 
Tech rooters eager, almost for 
blood. As a result the management 
Avas forced to lock the doors in 
order to prevent a probable, riot for 
a view of the onslaught. Those on 
the inside patted themselves on the 
back for being wise enough to come 
early while those on the outside 
swore inwardly and either retraced 
their steps down Woodlawn avenue 
or waited outside to hear the final 
score.
Five field goals were caged during 
the evening by Pitt, while Tech fol-' 
lowed closely with four. Lubic 
dropped the ball squarely through 
the net fifteen times out of a possi
ble eighteen, while Abrams netted 
13 out of 17. At the beginning of 
the game Avhen the score stood 7-6, 
not a field goal had been made, 
Abrams and Lubic battling it out 
for supremacy with foul shooting. 
A couple of field goals and more 
fouls left the score 13-9, Pitt, at the 
end of the first half.
Full of vigor and pep Tech came 
back strong upon their return to the 
floor and soon had passed Pitt J6-15. 
Again the unerring aim of Lubic 
-was used to advantage a'couple of 
times and Tech was left slightly in 
the lurch and although close was not 
again able to tie ' the score. The
Playing one of the snappiest 
games ever seen on the Tech floor 
the plaid quintet put asunder the 
bunch from Buffalo. Not once dur
ing the entire game were there any 
grave doubts concerning the out
come of the game. The University 
of Buffalo was seriously handicapped 
by the inability of their foul shooter, 
Roberts, to cage the  ball, while 
Abrams for Tech dropped them in 
consistently.
For speed and clever passwork 
much credit must be given to the 
U. of B. five, but this combination 
alone failed to roll up the all im
portant item, the final score. Three 
times their captain called time and 
each time had a get-together con
sultation concerning the method of 
proceedure to stop the storm they 
were undergoing. All for naught 
however. The wave continued and 
left Buffalo high and dry at the end 
of the game with the short end of 
a 23 34 score.
Who were Techs stars? Everyone 
was a star. If Pitt had been the 
victim at hand last Tuesday night 
the outcome according to several re
liable critics would have had a lit
tle different aspect than the result 
of Saturday evenings escapade. 
Unger of Buffalo Avas undoubtedly 
the best bet for Buffalo, but seemed 
to lack the support of his ''team
mates when it came to a tight 
pinch. The game:

until 1890. From 1890 to 1892 he was 
engaged in private practice. From 
1892 to 1901 he was instructor in Me
chanics and Hydraulics at Cornell, 
and from 1901 to 1905 he was assistant 
professor at the same institution. 
From 1905 to 1909 he was associate 
professor of Hydraulics at M. I. T. In 
1909 he came to Carnegie Tech as head 
of the Department of Civil Engineer

about the first of April.
SENATORS MESSAGE 
STIRS YALE STUDENTS
Chairman of Military Com
mittee Warns Against 
Over Confidence
Washington Feb. 14 Senator Goo.
E. Chamberlain of Oregon, Chairman 
of the Senate Committee 011 Military 
Affairs and author of the universal 
military training bill now before 
Congress, made a statement for the 
Yale News today in which he out
lined his views 011 how the colleges 
and universities of this country may 
aid in preparing an adequate sys
tem of national defense. Senator 
Chamberlain mentioned the use of a 
revised military history of the. United 
States, which would sliow the young 
men of the nation the need of a 
trained citizenry and the disasters 
which have followed our arms in 
previous wars because of the lack of 
such a force, and one of the im
portant ways in which our institu
tions of learning may render mate
rial help. Senator Chammerlains 
statement follows:
It has always seemed to me that 
there should be introduced in the 
colleges and universities a revised 
history of the United States. The 
impression the young man generally 
gets from the histories that, are used 
in the high, schools, colleges and uni(Continued on Page Three.)
MILITARY MEETING FOR 
TRAINED MEN CALLED
Faculty and Students to Dis
cuss Situation. Professor 
Keller to Be Adjutant
NEW YORK STATE CLUB 
WILL HAVE A BANQUET
On Friday evening the twentythird of March at the National res
taurant, the representatives of the 
Empire State at Carnegie Tech will 
hold a banquet. This will be a very 
important meeting as the election of 
officers will be held. An entertain
ing program has been planned. All 
members are urged to. attend.
Tonight in Room 113 of the science 
buiding there is to be a meeting of 
all men at Tech, both faculty and 
students, who have had military 
training. The call for the meeting 
was inspired by the "get together 
spirit which has arisen from the be
ginnings of the central council of 
the' four schools, and by the present 
active discussion of military training 
throughout the school. Since there 
is no definite organization as yet 
which might take charge of the mat
ter, it was thought best to leave it 
in |he hands of those men who have 
had,, military training, and are con
sequently best able to discuss the 
situation. The meeting tonight is 
ouevof discussion and planning only. 
The faculty members who expect to 
be [present include Professors Mott 
and! Stanton of Science and Profes
sor] Leeds of Industries, all of whom 
werfe at Plattsburg last summer. 
Thay have been giving the matter 
cank'ul consideration, and will be 
ready to lay their opinion as to the 
situation here before the meeting to
night.
If the meeting deems it necessary 
they may appoint a committee to go 
011 with some phase or other of mili
tary preparedness. Quite possibly 
they will undertake to assist Pro
fessor Keller at his work in the 
newly, created position as adjutant 
of the school. As was explained in 
last} week's issue of the Tartan, the 
adjutant is to compile a sort of 
census which will be valuable as pre
paredness material.
INDUSTRIES NIGHT 
SENIORS TO BANQUET
The night seniors of the Indus
tries School held a class meeting last 
Thursday evening and set Saturday 
evening, April 14, as the date for 
the class banquet. A committee, con
sisting of H. W. Bull, chairman; E. 
J. Smotzer, S. J. Kelly and W. 
Broadberry was appointed to make 
the arrangements.
The next meeting of the class will 
be held on Tuesday evening, March 
20, at 9:30 p. 111., in Room 223.
INTERESTING ADDRESS AT INDUSTRIES ASSEMBLY
Mr. Edward A. Woods, Pittsburgh 
representative of the Equitable Life 
Assurance Society of the United 
States, addressed the students of 
the Industries School on the subject 
of "Thrift, at the assembly meeting 
last Wednesday. Mr. Woods pre
sented his subject in a very intel
ligible manner and his entire ad
dress proved extremely interesting.
PREPAREBNESS AT UNIVERSITIES MAKES BIG STRIBES BURING WEEK

CampaignLafayette and 
Amherst Also Active
Syracuse Daily Orange.
Join the Red Cross 
Probably all the women in the 
university are aware that an a;tive 
Red Cross campaign is being earned 
on in Syracuse. What support shall 
we give?
Certainly the two thousand women 
enrolled in Syracuse University can 
help toward getting the 6,000 Red 
Cross members for which Syracuse 
is working. The women who recent
ly voted in favor of military train
ing ought logically to be among the 
first members of the Red Cross.
When the Red Cross classes were 
formed sixty women eagerly enrolled. 
If that number are willing to offer 
their services as nurses many more 
ought to enroll as members of the 
society. No canvassing has been 
done around the Hill but when you 
go downtown take the opportunity 
to stop in at the city branch office 
or at any of the places where the 
campaigners are stationed and sign 
up.

FORMER SECRETARY 
TO DEAN LEETE DEAD
Mrs. Juniata MegraAv Loety, aged 
27, Avife of Ralph J. Leely, died after 
an operation in the West Penn Hos
pital. She was born and reared in 
Pittsburgh and Avas a graduate of 
the Pittsburgh Commercial High 
School. For several years she Avas 
private secretary to Dean John H. 
Leete of the School of Applied 
Science of Carnegie Institute of 
Technology. Mr. Leety took Avork 
in the science night school in the 
1907-1909 period. Besides her hus
band she leaves one daughter, Miss 
Marcia Ellen Leety; her mother and 
father, Mr. and Mrs. William E. MegraAv; one brother, William E. MegraAV, and one sister, Mrs. Lucy L. 
Lippincott of Pittsburgh.
With the closing of the basketball 
season the natural course of events 
is to turn toward baseball Avhich up 
to the present time, both as regards 
whom Ave are to play this season 
and who is going to play, has re

A gay and brilliant audience greeted 
the performers in the annual concert 
given Friday eArening in Carnegie Mu
sic Hall by the Glee Club, Mr. Bertram 
Webber, director, and the Mandolin 
Club, under the direction of Mr. 
Scalzo.
The rear of the stage Avas trans
formed into a very artistic background 
by screens of trellis Avork overhung 
with wisteria.
The first part of the concert Avas devo'ted entirely to the usual ligitimate 
Glee Club program, the opening num
ber being "Alma Mater, with the audi
ence standing. The Glee Club then 
SAvung into the Coleridge-Taylor Vik
ing Song, which Avas given Avitli com
mendable vigor. Jane I-IathaAvays 
"Im Longing for You served as an 
excellent foildemonstrating their 
versatility. It. Avas given Avitli feeling 
and a nice balance of parts. The "Me
teor March, the introductory number 
of the Mandolin Club, Avas played with 
spirit and received with well merited 
applause.
The most popular ensemble number 
of the Glee Club Avas Nevlns Bells 
of Shandon. The music recommends 
itself and in addition Avas very Avell 
sung.
The excerpt from The Blue Para
dise, "Auf WIedersehn," by the Man
dolin Club, Avas a very pleasing numbor. Their most, popular offerings 
Avoro Herbert's "Serenade and "Old 
Glory, a medley. In both of these 
numbers, Mr. Scalzo succeeded in 
eliciting a volume of tone, amazing in 
its fullness and mellowness, from 
these usually hopeless instruments 
about Avhich It Is ahvays dllllcult. Lo 
think seriously. The ensemble work 
was excellent, throughout the pro
gram, also their sense of nuance.
The Mandolin Trio, Messrs. Cost, 
Sweeny and Madison, was hoarlily on* 
cored.
The roador was Mr. C. B. Reid, 
whose sympathetic voice added much 
to Ills reading of "Aux Itallons, Bulwor Lytton. Tho audience demanded 
an encore and wore delighted with a 
rhymed version of "Itomoo and Juliet 
In the vernacular, which was tho 
souroo of much laughter,
Mr. Schultz, accompanist, for tho 
clubs, revealed himself In a new role, 
an Impersonation of the Impassioned 
and l.omperamontiil conductor. He ap
pears to have boon a close observor, 
as he had Sousa, Croatoro and all tho 
rest of them rolled Into one. lie was 
decidedly funny. Where he got the 
gloves, will always bo a question.
Most ol! Part Second was given ovor 
to a "Miniature Minstrel Show, un

organization their opportunity to bo

THE HOME CONCERT
Last Friday evening the musical clubs gave us a concert which 
future years will fine!" difficult to equal. Ensembles, quartettes, 
trios, and solos gave variety and novelty to the performance. 
Serious and comedy numbers alternated with readings and special
ties. The miniature minstrel show was the clubs first attempt at 
an entertainment of that kind, and was particularly well received. 
The quality of a musical program is after all a matter of personal 
opinion, but it is greatly to the credit of the clubs that the con
sensus of opinion makes this years home concert the best ever.
The musical clubs, under the leadership of Messrs. Weber and 
Sealzo, are practically the only activity in the school which has 
kept pace with the progress made by the football team the last 
few years. The clubs' are doing a great work in keeping the name 
of Carnegie Tech before the audiences which they entertain in the 
cities of Ohio and Western Pennsylvania. Press comments in these 
(.lies have been very favorable this .year. The clubs, perhaps even 
more than the athletic teams, help to bind the alumni in those 
cities to their Alma Mat or; the concert at Akron was under the 
auspices ol! the Alumni Clan of Akron, and the clubs were enter
tained by nn alumnus at Oil City. The men. who have won their 
insignia- this year in Techs largest non-athletic activity certainly 
deserve it for the merit of their work.
OH, SAY, CAN YOU SEE?
In this time of doubt and uncertainty in the nation, Carnegie 
Tech is not flying her countrys (lag, for the very good reason that 
wo possess neither a ilag nor a place to display one. People all 
about, us arc (lying their colors; we can see the citys ilag on one 
side in the park, mid farther up the hill that of the Golf Club. The 
public schools of this city nil have their flagpoles.- Almost every 
other man one meets on the street is wearing a little red white and 
blue emblem ol some sort on the lapel of his coat. Yet nil that an 
institution like ('nrnegie Tech can boast ol! is one small flag over 
the entrance to the School ol! Applied Industries, and one which 
appears even smaller at the Margaret Morrison School. As a. united 
.institution we have nothingneither Hag nor flagpole.
Although this lack is especially conspicuous at a time when 
every man, in this school or out of it, should be exhibiting all that 
he has of patriotism, still the need for a flagpole on the campus is 
more than a passing fancy. There are a hundred and one occasions 
upon which it might be used. Tech as a school does not have the 
time for any lengthy ceremony on our national holidays, but Tech 
could and should attend to the little matter of flying a flag at those 
times. Occasionally there occur state or city celebrations in which 
the Tech students take an active interest, as they did in the City 
Charter Celebration last fall. There is no better way in which we 
might show that interest simply yet conclusively than by the use 
of the Stars and Stripes.
Aside from these more important affairs, practically every cer
emony in student life would gain in impressiveness through the 
presence of a flagpole on the campus. There is at least one high 
school in this city which has in its lower hall a bronze tablet 
enscribed with the names of the men who volunteered from that 
school during the Civil War. Student meetings are held before 
that tablet as often as is possible, especially those meetings which 
have to do with some school achievement. Why might not a simi
lar custom be instituted around a Carnegie Tech flagpole? Certain
ly the pledge of the Carnegie Clan on Qualification Day would be 
far more impressive if it were taken under the Stars and Stripes. 
For occasions like Carnegie Day there might be a Tech flag de
signed from the tartan plaid. Whenever the students go from their 
schools to the Music Hall, as they do on Commencement Day, it 
would be quite appropriate to have the faculty and students pass 
in review before the officers of administration or any school visitors, 
the reviewing group to be stationed at the foot of our flagpole. 
These things are, of course, merely suggestions, but certainly they 
indicate the need very plainly.
The problem, too, is one which might be solved without any 
great expense. Just at our hand on the McGinley property there 
is a flagpole which appears to be so situated that it will be included 
in the present cut. Why not move that to the campusV The only 
expense would be that of the labor involved. Or if that plan is not 
feasible, surely the need is urgent enough and the time is opportune 
enough to warrant the expenditure of whatever amount is necessary 
to purchase a. flag and flagstaff. The matter has been brought to 
the attention of the administration, and we believe that they are 
already laying plans to remedy this defect.
Eighteen loyal Tech men met on 
Saturday evening, February 7, in 
the rose room of the Great Northern 
Hotel in New York City to form the 
New York Clan of the Alumni Asso
ciation. As our correspondent writes, 
"All looked prosperous and happy, 
even the married men. The good 
fellowship of Tech men. was veiy 
much in evidence and the &anie spirit 
which was prevalent on the campus 
inspired the men to even a more 
loyal feeling.
There were several men present 
who were former members of other 
Tech Clans and they told of the his
tory and organization oi the grad
uates with which they had been as
sociated. The speakers were George 
Blair of the Tech Border Clan, El 
Paso, Texas; J. L. Johnson of the 
Chicago Clan. Tom Patterson of De
troit, Bill Gehron, a New York archi
tect, and W. M. Sheldon of Newark,1 
N. J.
T. L. Patterson stated that in De
troit advertisements were inserted 
in the Help Wanted column of 
the daily papers, asking all Tech 
men in that section to join the or
ganization. This was not because 
they felt that the eyes of Tech men 
were on the Help Wanted column, 
but they believed in the value of 
newspaper advertising.
A committee was appointed to look 
for a room solnewhere about the city 
which might be used for club pur
poses. This the men felt might be 
the beginning of a Tech Club house 
in New York. There are about forty 
men in the district known to the 
organization but there are many 
others whose names are not on the 
roll. They are advised to get in 
touch with Mr. E. B. Sturges, I,loom 
109 Customerliouse, New York City. 
The following officers were elected:
E. B. Sturgess, '16, president. I
L. E. Griswold, '13, vice president.
P. N. Bossart, .1.(5, secretary.
(!. T. Patterson, '15, treasurer.
.Tillius Gorzo, in, chairman of con
stitutional committee.
'The following was a list of those 
present:
Fritz Behrle, G. S. Blair, P. N. Bossnrt, Miss Darcy, Harry Franks, Wil
liam Gehron, Charles Glass, Julius 
Golzo, L. E. Griswold, Julius Guter, 
J. L. Johnson, J. J. Laudig, Simon

For pure, unadulterated sloppiness | 
she could not be surpassed.
Esther Fromme's Clem (Mrs.) Gal-! 
loway was a good impersonation of 
the woman who worked to support a ! 
good-for-nothing husband and yet [ 
shielded his worthlessness.
Katherine Jones as Amanda Afflick, the hopelessly homely and pa
thetically neglected girl, known as 
Op-'O-Me-Thumb, because of her 
diminutive size, was very well cast in 
this part. She has a peculiar quality 
of voice that suits the situation. She 
caught the pathos of the character and 
brought that forward quite success
fully. She was the girl whose great 
imagination compensated in a meas
ure for what she was really missing 
in lifewho tried to persuade herself 
that things were otherwisebut who 
has her brief moment.of realization as 
the curtain goes down.
Mr. Howard Smith, the only male 
member of the cast, did very accept
able work in the role of Horace 
Greensmith, the unconscious hero of 
Amanda's day-dreams.
The costumes have had but one rival 
in interest, and that was in the 
Poetaster, while the various styles 
in hair dressing were, to say the least, 
diverting . Mr. Norwood Engle was 
stage-manager on this occasion.

MEN AT DORDER
When our government called out j 
the National Guard last March and 
ordered them to the border several 
of the Tech Clan were among the | 
ones to go. The school was proud i 
of the fact that she could be repre-! 
sented there in that field of work, 
as well as in the engineering and in
dustrial fields. Those that went en
joyed the trip and the service for 
-Uncle Sam.
Among the Tech Clan that were | 
at the border with the Eighteenth 
Regiment were: Alumni, Captain S.
J. Taylor, '13; F. S. Crawford, 13; 
A. J. Peterson, 13; J. P. Bailey, 13; 
Cleve Mortenson, '14; G. S. Blair, 
13. Former students L. W. McIntire, Peter Revegno, R. B. Bogardus, C. R. Rinehart. Students F. B. 
Treat, Mesta, R. S. Snyder, Wm. 
Brazelton.
All were glad to get back to Pitts
burgh, as was clearly shown when 
the train bearing th'e Eighteenth 
Regiment pulled into the station. 
The men had happy faces and a 
smile for everyone. They were 
marched directly from the station 
down Fifth avenue to the armory on 
Schenley Farms, where they were 
mustered out of service. Many wives 
and sweethearts were made' happy 
by their return and many a. man 
waved his hand in greeting to ex
pectant friends.
The students of Tech should honor 
these boys, for although they were 
not.engaged- in any fights, they went 
with the whole souled purpose of 
fighting for the good of their coun
try. And we are sure if any chance 
would have been offered them they 
would have shown the same true 
spirit there that they have shown 
during their years here as students 
of Tech.

DRAMATISTS PRESENT 
 OP 0-ME-THUMB
This one-act play by Frederick Fenn 
and Richard Pryce .was presented in 
the theater of the School of Applied 
Design on Friday afternoon, before a 
very appreciative audience. It offered 
an opportunity for some remarkable 
character work in an entirely new di
rection, and the cast made the most of 
the opportunity under the careful di
rection of Mr. Beatty, of this depart
ment.
The action takes place in a laundry 
in Soho, London, and gives one a 
glimpse of how the other half live; 
and what strikes one first as being 
excrutiatingly funny, suddenly ob
trudes itself on ones consciousness as 
being miserably patheticand when it 
is over, one calls it a play, not a 
"comedy, because, as ane of the au
dience remarked on the way out, It 
somehow does not end rightwhich, 
of course, meant that one had an un
comfortable sensation in the throat, 
as one does when compelled to swal
low tears. That is the sort of play it 
isthe truth gets over, in spite of 
the laughter and the grotesqueness.
Veolante Bollingers Madame 
Jeanne Marie Napoleon de Gallifet 
Didier was exceedingly well doiie 
in fact, she has a propensity for do
ing things well, to judge from any
thing she has essayed, and this char
acter is widely divergent from any 
other that she has attempted.
Mary Ricards made Celeste a 
most interesting character, whose im
pudence and self-satisfaction were 
very amusing. Her whole mannerher 
clothes, her walk, everything she did, 
suggested the creature she was. She 
entered fully into the role.
Hazel Becks Rose Jordan, the 
pugnacious blond, who chewed gum 
in a way that defied criticism (it was 
as artistically done as the way they 
ate spaghetti in the Music Master) 
and carried a black eye as a relic of 
recent encounters, was one of the 
best characterizations in the play.
PREPAREDNESS AT UNIVERSI
TES MAKES BIG STRIDES
(Continued from Page One)
The American Red Cross and its 
work was explained by Mr. Albert 
T. Tamblyn assistant director of the 
Atlantic Division at Liberal Arts 
Chapel yesterday morning.
The purpose of the movement, 
stated Mr. Tamblyn, is to mobilize 
the nation's generous impulses so 
that, with adequate finances and in
terests, efficient relief may be ren
dered when needed in peace or in 
war.. Mr. Tamblyn went on to show 
that the United States is far.behind 
the other nations in citizen members 
of the Red Cross. Little Japan with 
a population of 40,000,000 has a Red 
Cross membership of 1,800,000, while 
the United States with its 100,000,000 
people has only 250,000 Red Cross 
members.
You are familiar with some of its 
achievements, continued the speaker, 
with the organized helpfulness, 
heroism and self-sacrifice of the men 
and women amid the horrors of war, 
devastating plagues, epidemics and 
other castastrophes involving loss of 
life and suffering. T]ie Red Cross 
is working for 1,000,000 American 
members, G,000 of whom Mr. Tam
blyn thinks should come, from Syra
cuse.

from the start, and ones main ef
forts were expended upon keeping 
in the game;-but space and time do 
not permit us to dwell upon this 
feature of the Plattsburg training, 
but it is of special importance in 
the general scheme.
A striking feature of all the train
ing camps has been the large per
centage of college men in attendance
in one company at the July camp 
nearly 60 per cent, of the men were 
college graduates  and Carnegie 
Tech has made a good start with 
possibly two dozen graduates and 
undergraduates at the 19.16 camp.
As the real value and importance 
of this training become better known 
and appreciated we may expect to 
see Tech men present in increasing 
numbers.

CARNEGIE TECH WELL REPRESENTED AT PLATTSBURG ! without its redeeming features, all
___________ programs and schedules were broken
(Continued From Page One.)
To many the training received at a 
camp like Plattsburg is a valuable 
supplement to the line and precept 
imparted in the classroom. It does 
us all good to know how to obey 
orders at once; to take part in the 
team work implied in squad, platoon 
and company maneuvers; to break 
away from the many petty, and often 
selfish, ways of everyday existence 
and to follow for thirty days the 
simple, though strenuous, life of a 
military training camp. Again, it is 
good for us all to stand upon the 
same plane of social equality and 
physical responsibility.
The Plattsburg camp is a most 
democratic institution and, regard
less of ones previous estate, whether 
one comes in a Peerless, a fiiver 
or afoot, the moment he steps up to 
the headquarters tent, is registered, 
assigned to company and regiment, 
and pays his coin and becomes the 
rookie, for such he is now de-" 
nominated, he realizes that he has, 
become merely a unit in a great 
machine.
His duties as private, or possibly 
as non-commissioned officer, upon 
the parade ground, on the march or 
at the rifle range are matters which 
are absorbed gradually and, for the 
average recruit, without much diffi
culty or hardship; but the grain and 
p9i.ii Aia.ios 0.ii; uuiu aqi jo .i0dui0i during those hours of the twentyfour when he is off duty and must 
adapt himself, more or less, to the 
ways of his seven companions-inarms within the four canvas walls 
of his tent.
Good temper and a spirit of give 
and take are essentials in a mans 
makeup if he expects to make good 
in his squad and not be subjected to 
the endless jibes and practical jokes 
which the manifestations of a 
thoughtless or selfish makeup amply 
justify in camp life.
A month of f training such as the 
Plattsburg camp furnishes does not, 
of course, turn out a soldier in the 
full sense of the word, but it does 
give the attentive student a most 
valuable experience, demonstrates 
what are the duties of a soldier in 
time of peace, and gives the civilian 
a broader basis of judgment regard
ing the very important question of 
national preparedness.
It is probable, too, that the great 
majority of the men returned to their 
homes with most favorable impres
sions of the officers who were as
signed from the regular army to 
command the companies and battal
ions at Plattsburg. \
During 1916 no first-year attend
ants were allowed to take up any 
branch of military service other 
than infantry, so that some were dis
appointed not to receive instruction 
in military engineering methods, but 
the large number in attendance arid 
the shortage of regular army officers 
made any extensive specialization 
impossible.
The daily routine was too strenu
ous to permit of much visiting out
side of the company street, so that 
one might live for a month within a 
biscuit toss of a friend and not meet 
him, and among the six or seven 
thousand men who attended the July 
camp it was no easy matter to find 
persons whom you knew to be in 
attendance. For these reasons the 
following list of Carnegie Tech men 
who attended the Plattsburg camps 
during the summer of 1916 is doubt
less incomplete:

(Continued From Page One.)
versities is that nothing but success 
has followed our troops in every war 
in which this country has ever been 
engaged. When we think of the 
Revolution we remember only that 
the Continental Army gained a de
cisive victory and forget- the re
verses which came to Washington 
and his soldiers in the earlier . days 
of that momentous struggle. When 
we think of 1S12, we remember only 
the valor of our armies and the suc
cessful termination of that war at 
the battle of New Orleans, but we 
forget that the Treaty of Ghent was 
signed before that decisive victory, 
that it was executed at a time when 
it looked as though the American 
Army was likely to meet with defeat, 
that it did not settle a single issue 
between the two governments en
gaged, and that without knowledge 
of the execution of this treaty Jack
son led his forces to victory and de
cided by .force of arms the issues 
which ought to have been embodied 
in the treaty itself. When Ave think 
of the Mexican War we remember 
only the successful achievements of 
our army and forget entirely the 
difficulties which that army encoun
tered before victory was achieved. 
When we thinlc of the Civil War we 
remember only the surrender at Appomatox and forget the sacrifices 
that were made because of untrained 
forces before victory was finally ac
complished.
"Where better to begin the study 
of the true, military history of our 
country than in the colleges and uni
versities, so that the young men may 
understand that one of the most es
sential things to military success is 
a trained citizenry, who can be called 
upon in sufficient numbers to meet 
any emergency that may arise 
whether from forces within or with
out? If this course be followed it 
will not be long until the people will 
be convinced that in universal mili
tary training lies the safety of the 
Republic.
The maintenance of a large stand
ing army is contrary to the ideals 
of a democracy and the European 
struggle must have convinced the 
most casual observer that one of two 
things is essential to the national 
safetyeither a large standing army 
it an enormous expense or a trained 
citizenry that can be utilized to re
cruit any army when called into 
action.
In the earlier days of our. history, 
America occupied a place of isola
tion amongst the powers of the 
earth. It was not necessary for us 
to be then prepared for a war of 
defense. \ But when Dewey entered 
Manila Bay he destroyed that isola
tion and placed our country in the 
category of a world power. And 
now it is up to the American people 
to say whether they will continue 
to occupy that position or whether 
they will take a place amongst the 
decadent nations of the earth.
If there had been no war in Eu
rope, I should still say there was 
necessity for preparedness for na
tional defense. When America be
came a world power it was her duty 
to see to it that she was at least 
the equal of any great powers of the 
earth, and to prepare, not for ag
gression, but for defense against one 
or all comers.
'Why ought we to have been pre
pared even before the war in Eu
rope? Because of the new obliga
tions that our position as a world 
power had cast upon us. The Eu
ropean war came upon us almost in
a night. So did the Spanish-American War. The shot that sank the 
Maine in the harbor of Havana was 
heard around the world, so far as 
America was concerned. Whether 
you call it a war of revenge or not. 
it was a war of the American peo
ple; and the act of a single in
dividual or power might have in
volved us with the world. We can 
never tell today what the morrow 
may bring forth.
But that was not all. American 
brain and American energy and 
American money built a canal which 
absolutely changed the geography of 
the world. That fact alone was suffi
cient to have compelled the patriotic 
American to have seen to it that 
our country, having changed that 
map of the world, should always be 
in a position where no other power 
on the face of the earth could 
change the handwriting of America 
across the Isthmus of Panama.
, Nor is that all. The ringing mes
sage of Monroe to the Congress of 
the United States in 1823 served 
notice upon the powers of the earth
that America was to be kept intact 
for Americans. There was no pussy
footed diplomacy about that mes
sage. In it he said:
 The American continents, by the I 
free and independent condition which 
they have assumed and maintain, are | 
henceforth not to be considered as j 
subjects for future colonization by i 
European powerswe should con
sider any attempt on their part to 
extend their system to any portion 
of this hemisphere as dangerous to 
our peace and safety. With the exist
ing colonies or dependencies of any 
European power, we have not inter
fered and shall not interfere.
But with the governments who 
have declared their independence 
and maintained it. and whose inde
pendence we have, on great consid
eration. and on just principles, ac
knowledged, we could not view any 
interposition for the purpose of op
pressing them, or controlling, in any 
other manner, their destiny, by any 
European power, in any other light 
than as the manifestation of an un
friendly disposition toward the 
United States.
And while as a matter of fact the 
Monroe Doctrine has been in force, 
on paper, at least, during nearly a 
hundred years, no foreign power has 
very strenuously attempted to arouse 
the passions of America to a point 
where their people felt it neces
sary to defend it with their lives 
and their fortunes.- So that if the 
Doctrine which was announced in 
1S23 was intended to be more than 
a mere formal message to Congress; 
if more than a simple notice served 
upon the powerful nations of the 
earth, if it has been resurrected 
and given new vitality in our nego
tiations with the Central and South 
American republics, if we intend to 
do what Monroe said we ought to 
do, if we intend to carry out the 
pledges and promises that within 
the last ten days were made to the 
representatives from these Central 
and South American republics, then, 
leaving out of consideration the war 
in Europe, it is our duty to see to 
it that our country is; prepared to 
carry out the obligations with all 
that this implies to the Central and 
South American republics; not so 
much for their protection as for our 
own and for the purpose of redeem
ing pledges that have practically 
been in existence between the 
United States and these countries 
for nearly a hundred years.
I sometimes fear that, like the 
old hen that has undertaken to cover 
more chicks than it is possible for 
her to .cover with her limited equip
ment, we have assumed some obliga
tion that we find it difficult to carry 
out. 1 know that wo cannot carry 
them out unless we are better pre
pared to do it than we are today. 
Now lliese are some of the obliga
tions that necessitate our preparing 
ourselves for defense.
"Let us soe if there are other 
dangers that have appeared since 
this terrible war in Europe. Why,
I think I remember that our good 
and canny Scotch friend, Mr. Car
negie, publicly stated loss than three 
years ago, that there could never be 
any more war, and that the. Kaiser 
had maintained the peace of Europe 
for more than a quarter of a cen
tury and would always do it. But 
war broke out in almost the 1 wink
ling of an eye and in its maelstrom 
has engulfed almost all the nations 
of the civilized world.
"Now let us look over on the 
Pacific side. They say wo ought not 
to talk about those possible dangers. 
Why not? If wo believe they exist, 
lot us talk about them. There Is 
too much of a disposition nowadays 
to conceal the truth from l.lie people.
I believe no one would go out of 
here and open his or her lips abOut 
it. I believe in taking the American 
people into our confidence. They 
are worthy of and entitled to it. 
With that feeling in my heart and 
that thought in my mind, I call your 
attention to the Orient. On the 
Pacific coast, where I live, we look 
across the water and see a power
ful, warlike people that in fifty years 
have developed into not only one of 
the most warlike nations on the face 
of the earth, but one of the most in
dustrious and enterprising; and I 
glory in the magnificent progress 
they have made.
"I have in my heart nothing but 
the kindest of feeling toward them. 
I like to see this great people pro
gress and grow great, and so do the 
American people. We do not hate, 
but rather love them. And yet there 
are racial differences and distinc
tions which will always prevent them 
from assimilation by our people 
either social or otherwise. Japan 
does not like us, nor does China; 
there is no question about that. A 
few years ago we had the humiliat
ing spectacle of a former President 
of the United States begging Cali
fornia not to discriminate against 
but to admit the Japanese to the 
schools of the Pacific coast, not
withstanding the fact that boys 18 
or 20 years of age were asked to be 
admitted into the schools with our 
little hoys and girls, children 8 or 
10 or 12 years of age.
"The California people did not 
submit to it. They would rather be 
driven into the sea, than to submit 
to It. That is not because they hate 
the Japanese. Far .from it. They 
respect the Japanese. They employ 
them in tholr families, In their fields 
and In their factories. They realize 
that the Japanese are a powerful 
race, a splendid people. But they 
were determined to control their own 
domestic affairs.
"Then a short while ago, when 
the Japanese seemed to be gaining 
too strong a foothold in California,

INSURANCE MAN TALKS 
TO THE FULCRUM CLUB
Thursday evening, in the Fulcrum 
club room, Mr, Edward I-I. Woods of 
the Equitable Life Assurance^ Com
pany addressed the club, members on 
the subject of Thrift.
Preceding his theme by a review 
of the relative savings and expendi
tures in the United States, Mr. 
Woods dwelt on the individual prob
lem of saving money. There are two 
institutions in the country whose 
function is to hold savings securities 
for depositors. One is the savings 
bank the other the life insurance 
company. The advantage of the lat
ter is the policy system, whereby 
the person insured must pay de
posits at regular intervals. The ten
dency of most persons to spend 
money before it is placed in security 
renders the savings account less ad
vantageous to the individual. Mr. 
Woods suggested that everyone keep 
a cash account, and a budget, tlnis 
providing definite information as to 
one's assets and liabilities. The in
dividual to be safe in (hard times 
must practice on a reduced scale, the 
financial system of big business.

PITT FRESHIES DEFEAT PLEBES IN FINAL GAME
in a fast preliminary game, the Pitt 
l^roshlus ran away from our represen

Skibo lessors away from their basket.

Following the final reading of the 
proposed Science School constitu
tion, and the revision of several de
tails of it, the organization commit
tee decided last Thursday to present 
the results of their work to the four 
classes for approval.
The senior class, at its meeting 
last Monday, approved the Constitu
tion, and proceeded to the election 
of representatives as provided by 
that instrument. This afternoon the 
junior class will take action on the 
matter, and the Sophomore and 
Plebe classes are expected to follow 
the junior class very shortly. It is 
recommended by the organization 
committee that the classes elect 
their representatives to the senate 
as soon, as possible after the ap
proval of the constitution. If this 
is done the seriate may bo organized 
and the school officers elected with
in two weeks. This is to bo desired 
since the science organization must 
be completed in order to handle ef
fectively the questions of inter-school 
government and military training 
which will be pressing for consid
eration very shortly.
At the last meeting of the or
ganization committee authority was 
given Chairman Orr to appoint rep
resentatives to a general school 
committee to consider inter-school 
government.
