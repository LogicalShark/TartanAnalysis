THE NEW ATHLETIC FIELD
The moment it was learned that we had lost the 
field near the Hotel Schenley by having it sold over 
our heads, plans were begun for finding some way 
out of the difficulty. Mr. Leeds, the treasurer of 
the temporary Athletic Association, attacked the 
problem with his usual energy and vigor and tried in 
several ways to borrow the necessary money for 
putting the hollow behind the Margaret Morrison 
School in condition to be used as a field. None of 
these projects met with success, and the one now 
being tried out was launched. While every Tech 
man has had the opportunity of hearing Mr. Leeds 
explain the plan in detail, we do not think it would 
be out of place to briefly review it again.
The Association needs $10,000 for grading, cutting 
and surfacing the site of the field and erecting the 
necessary grand stands and fences. To have the 
field ready for use in the spring, the grading now 
being done must go on with no interruptions. There 
is no time time for talk; we will have to do things 
and do them quickly. As the association has noth
ing to offer in the way of collateral for the guarantee 
of loans, no bank will advance the money. The 
proposition then is for the student body to make in
dividual loans to the association for a term of years 
they think they can afford, the Association to give 
in return a promissory note for the amount and the 
time for which the loan is made. As the money from 
this source comes into the hands of the Association, 
it is banked and used for the carrying out of the 
work on the field.
The plan was placed before the day students in a 
mass meeting called for the purpose, and $3,500 
promised before it adjourned. The sentiment of the 
meeting was decidedly in favor of the proposition
and of doing everything possible to help the thing 
along. The night men in two meetings raised 
$1,000. By a careful study of the subscription lists 
it has been learned that only 50% of the day and 25% 
of the night students have signified their intention 
of making loans. Since the success of the plan de
pends largely on the popular and general support 
that is accorded by the students, it does look as 
though there are by far the larger majorty of the 
men who do not feel sufficiently interested to even 
make a loan of $1. The management are hoping 
that after the holidays the list will show a larger per
centage of the student body as contributors. It 
should be explained once more that the money prom
ised, while due and needed now, can be paid to Mr.. 
Leeds at any time within a month or so.
We feel that as the time goes on and the rest of 
the students begin to more thoroughly understand 
the condition of affairs, that the remainder will 
come up. Various clubs, dormitories and classes 
have taken the thing up in the right way and are 
at present trying to outdo each other in the amount 
of money they can raise. A list of these will appear 
at an early date, and their progress made known 
through these columns.
So far during the campaign no systematic efforts 
have been employed in the schools or out. After 
the holidays it is the intention to put the conquest 
on that footing and not go outside except as a last 
resort, and then only to persons who are known to 
be friends of the schools and who are interested 
and understand what is being attempted. The suc
cess or failure of the entire scheme is now in the 
hands of the student body, and the meaning of it is 
will we have athletics at home during the coming 
season or not?

4THE TARTAN
A TALE OF CHRISTMAS.
By A. Fire.
Your turn this evening, Fire, exclaimed the 
poker, as the quiet of night settled down over the 
household.
Tell us about Christmas, said the Coal Scuttle.
Very wrell, then, I'll tell you about last Christmas 
in this very house. The house, as you know, is the 
old homestead of the Browns. It used to be con
sidered in the country, but now, since the electric 
line passes it, one could hardly speak of it so. Many 
modern houses have been built near it, but it is still 
just the same old New England home. The Browns 
moved to the city after the railway company paid 
for the right of way through the property and the 
house was rented to a poor but honorable family.
Those who now cluster about my hearth are the 
parents, a young lady of twenty-one, a lad of sixteen, 
and three small childrenso young that they still 
believe in Santa Claus. This had been their home 
but three months when my story began. As the 
Christmas-tide drew near, I noticed a dejected look 
on the fathers face and a sorrowful expression on 
the mothers. It was on Christmas eve th^t I learned 
its cause.
"The children had hung their stockings on the 
mantel above me and scampered off to bed full of 
earger anticipation. After kissing the children 
good night, the father and mother sat down before 
me. Both sat, silently looking at me, through me, 
and beyondto what? Finally the mother broke the 
silence, John, we will have to do something. It 
will break their little hearts when they find that 
Santa has forgotten them entirely. Surely there is 
a way. Let us go into the kitchen and see what we 
can do.
About an hour later they came back with two 
bowls and a cake tin. From one bowl they took sev
eral little cakes, and dividing them evenly, put them 
into the stockings. The taffy from the cake tin fol
lowed. Then both parents sat down with the other 
bowl between them and began to string popcorn. 
This gave a somewhat festive air to the room when 
it had been draped on the mantel. Still the couple 
seemed not satisfied. The father sighed and said, 
It is better than nothing, but, oh, how I wish there 
were some toys! But we ought to be thankful for 
other thingsthankful that I have been promised a 
position after the New Year. (I, too, was thankful 
for this, as it was with great difficulty that I man
aged to keep alive on the amount of fuel they gave 
me.)
After turning out the lights, and carefully cover
ing me with ashes, they wrent to bed. Soon all was 
still and I was left to my own reflections. Ah! what 
was that I heard, and where did that draft of air 
come from? I peeped out curiously from under my 
cover of ashes just in time to see a young man come 
through the window. He was tall, well built, and 
about twenty years old. His face was strangely fa
miliar and I felt certain I had seen him before. Af
ter warming his hands r.t the inquisitive flames I 
had sent out, he placed on the table a suit case and 
some packages, and began to open them. Presently, 
he brought forth a baby doll, a set of childs dishes, 
some tm soldiers, a drum, and various other things 
wrapped in tissue paper. These he placed on the 
mantel or floor near the stockings, and on the table. 
Then, with a pleased smile, he slipped through the 
window and carefully closed it. Again all was still, 
but I could scarcely keep from bursting out into 
dancing flames, I was so eager for the morrow.
"Early in the morning, the children came tumbling 
over each other in their anxiety to see what Santa 
had left, and were fairly wild with glee over their 
treasures. The older ones looked on with perplexed 
faces. What could it mean? Had they been dream
ing all these years that Santa Claus was a myth 
and now awaked to find him a reality?
Suddenly a jolly, Merry Christmas, all, was 
heard and my young man came bounding into the 
room. In a minute he had the woman in his arms 
and was saying, Mother, how good it is to see yon 
again! When she could speak she whispered that 
it was just as good to have her family all together 
again on this Christmas day. The children were al
ready playing happily in a corner of the room, and 
the older ones gathered around me and began ques
tioning the young man. The mother began to count 
up the years that he had been away striving for suc
cess in the great world. It was five years since he 
had left home to become a clerk in a large depart
ment store in a distant city. Now he was in the 
office and was promised a better position at the be
ginning of the New Year. On account of the dis
tance and the holiday rush he had never been able 
to get home even 011 Christmas.
All of a sudden the mother exclaimed, Jim! You 
were Santa Claus! But how did you get in, and 
where did you sleep?
 Mother, in your excitement last evening you 
must have forgotten to lock the front window, so 
thats how I got in. And 1 happened to meet one 
of my old boy friends on the car last night and I told 
him of my plan of sneaking in, placing my presents, 
and slipping up to the bed I knew you ilways had 
ready for me. He thought it would be much jollier 
to leave the things to surprise you, and suggested 
that I go home and sleep with him. So thats how 
it happened. Mother, it is great to be home again 
around this jolly open fire. I wish II wish I never 
I wish I could but here the fire flickered out, 
leaving its companions of the hearth to finish the 
story according to their own ideas.
M. L. S.Jr. H. A.
VAN CUREN TO THE FRONT.
Everybody seems to want to help the Field Fund 
along. The latest is the Tech Barber, and his 
scheme is briefly as follows: Mr. Van Curen has 
donated a $5 shaving ticket to the fund; this is to be 
raffled off and the entire proceeds go to the Fund. 
The lucky man gets the shaving ticket and the Ath
letic Association gets the money.

CRAFTSMAN SMOKER.
The Craftsman held their first smoker Friday 
evening, Dec. 11, 1908, in Assembly Hall, and it 
proved to be quite a success; but the next will be 
better, as we will have our Glee Club in better con
dition. We expected to have a violinist and mandolinist, but were disappointed, as they were unable to 
attend, although the piano solos rendered by Messrs. 
Caldwood and Day were excellent. Then were very 
interesting and witty addre&ses given by Messrs. 
Connelly, Birge, Carroa, Browm, Schoonmuker, Bachtel, Taylor, Curry and Stein. Near the close of the 
evening Mr. Connelly made a very witty presentation 
speech, after which he presented Mr. Zellman, our 
exceptionally good president, a cigar about 
thirty-six inches long. After smoking to their hearts 
content, all the members departed to their homes, 
wishing the Craftsman Club success. The next day 
one of our interested members, while dining, left 
his thoughts wander and finally they began to work, 
with the following result:
THE AFTER EFFECTS.
As a large majority of the members turned out to 
the smoker, held last Friday night, you may 
guess it was the seasons crowning success.
After the weed was passed around, with labels gold 
bound and names that were true or fictitious.
Then the smoke began to curl, which was delicious.
I for one not used to long stemmed pipes and rich 
cigars,
Reached my home in the early hours.
After repairing to my cot, I found that peace and 
repose were not my lot;
For scarce had I closed my eyes in sleep, than I had 
a visitor from the deep.
Grim old Death, all robed in black, bid me enter his 
aerial hack.
After traveling awhile through space, we came to the 
river at a certain place,
Where serpentine paths were leading down to the 
boat-house kept by Charon, of great renown,
And many serpents were loafing around, whether 
laying or lying I do not know,
As they may have been laying eggs or lying down.
After crossing over Styx, I found myself in a terrible 
fix,
For two roads were there, I took the one that showed 
the greatest wear.
Directly I came to a great iron gate, where you pay 
the toll of eternal fate.
Then Cerberus growled, and the imperial Imp, with 
warts and thorns all over his face,
Ushered me to a warmer place, a seat right close to 
the throne,
When the devil awoke with an awful groan,
He looked me oer and smiled and nodded as never 
before,
He bowed till his head touched the floor, and imps 
buzzed around me by the score.
I asked the reason of all this, he made reply, If you 
look around you will see no doubt that tech
nical brains are not barred without.
And in recent years a club was formed of men like 
this.
Yesterday we organized, and as I see you wear the  
degree, I welcome you to your destiny.
Then the band struck up the national air, whistles 
blew and bells rang, as out of bed I quickly 
sprang, these words to hear:
Arent you going to work, my dear9
Being saturated with smoke, I take this just as a joke, 
and being not much on a theme, its not so 
bad for a dream.

Miss Harding says that exams are more of a test

the teachers have our sympathy. Since this is the 
season of goodwill we would gladly forego those 
same exams in order to relieve the strain and restore 
the peace of mind of our instructors! Or how about 
exchanging places?

There is a young lady in the Senior Class who does 
not take the Gymnasium work. However, she appre
ciates the tonic effect of a shower bath and feels a 
need of some such stimulant. But no one is permit
ted within the sacred precincts of the Gym except 
regular members of the class in session. So how 
shall she obtain this desiie of her heart? Eureka!  
the Lab! It is such a cinch! In the Gym, you 
turn the faucet, and instead of the cool shower you 
expected, you are scalded! But no such vncertainty 
in the Lab! You have but to close your eyes and 
turn on the gasand immediately you get such a 
cold shower as will make you gasp for fifteen min
utes. So this young lady in question solved her 
problem and has become as fond of her shower as 
the duck is of water. We are somewhat alarmed 
about her, and take this occasion to remind her that 
although a cold shower once a day may be a good 
thing, two in one hour are apt to prove dangerous 
through over-stimulation!

plant a kitchen garden for the use of the house. 
We could train peas and beans on that wire just 
beautifully, and the crop would be gathered before 
the plat will be needed for a foot-ball field. Then 
the wire would be doing something useful in the 
world, and the beans wouldnt hurt it either.

Saturday evening Director and Mrs. Hamerschlag 
entertained the entire faculty of the four schools. 
The guests were received in the apartment of the 
M. M. C. S. Cards and dancing were features of the 
entertainment. Refreshments were served in the 
lunch room. The Senior Household Arts Class did 
the catering and have reason to be proud of their 
first business venture. The decorations were in pink 
and white and the pink gowns and white aprons of 
the girls added to the artistic appearance. As this 
was the first gathering of the faculties of the four 
schools, it was an occasion., for the old members to 
greet the new, as well as a delightful time for all. 
The guests departed just before it was Sunday 
morning, assuring Director and Mrs. Hamerschlag 
of their success in making each one enjoy the even

INDUSTRIALS
FIRST YEAR INDUSTRIALS.
Incidentally, the First Year Industrials took the 
initiative in separate school contribution by starting 
the ball rolling with $100.00 for building the new 
Athletic Association Stadium, back of the Margaret 
Morrison School.
Last Friday a meeting was called and about 85 
faithfuls turned out. Boulfrois got the list of stu
dents in the first year from Mr. Morris and called 
the roll. Mr. Leeds was then introduced and thank
ed the boys for the, unusual strong spirit they have 
shown for first year men. He went ovsr the pre
liminaries about the Stadium briefly, and then went 
ahead in that easy, confiding Leeds style, that is 
making Mr. Dark and Light lines famous these 
days.
The noise with which he was greeted at the end, 
was significant of the way the boys appreciated 
him.
After Mr. Leeds was allowed to leave, Boulfrois 
took up the roll again and started what proved to 
be a cinch task in greeting that $100.00 which the 
first year Industrials had subscribed at the initial 
meeting of the whole school.
Although only about 60% turned out, all the live 
ones must have been there with their Christmas 
money, because instead of raising $100.00 they got 
(can you guess?)welljust a cool Eight Hundred 
and Sixty-three Real Dollars ($863.00). And what's 
more we intend to make it over a thousand at our 
next meeting or probably at our  Banquet. If you 
can find out when that is, come around and swell 
the fund.

K. K., no, these are not the initial letters of any 
Fraternity nor do they stand for Klu Klux, even 
though they be coupled with whiskers of anarchistic 
tendency. No, they are only the letters that must 
precede Mr. Stevens name on his monthly voucher 
in order to make it valid. With such a combination 
one would look for a Professor of the Semitic lan
guages or an instructor in Political Economy rather 
than one who follows the more prosaic occupation of 
initiating the timid lambs, as one of their own num
ber has so aptly dubbed them, into the'mysteries of 
Chemistry. But be that as it may, as uich he is 
among us and has been since the early fall of 1907.
Mr. Stevens came here fresh from work in indus
trial laboratories, although teaching was not en
tirely new to him, and immediately began to reminis 
of foot-ball as it should be played, and to hear him 
tell it, as played at Michigan, the school he claims 
as his Alma Mater. But even while enthusing on 
Athletics, his former teaching experience stood him 
in good stead and he was ever watchful that the 
timid lambs did not get too generous with the 
regents used, lest haply some of them should go 
from here to there or where it doesn't snow. 
When he joined us, he wras in the throes of raising 
a beard, and the necessary questions and answers 
appertaining thereunto served to make all hands 
better acquainted. Mr. Stevens had expected to rel
egate the hirsute privilege to the next arrival in 
the chemical force, but Dr. Schaeffer refused to take 
up the burden, as he had taken it from Dr. Sill, and 
he still has the beard.
The account of the newest plan that has been pro
posed for raising the money necessary for the com
pleting of the athletic field appearing in another 
column, deserves more than passing notice. There 
is undoubtedly a time during the infancy of the 
athletic situation in any large school, college, or 
university, when a great effort and sacrifice from 
the student body becomes necessary in order that 
the plans for putting things on a permanent basis 
can be carried out. We have now reached that 
stage. What is asked is not a gift in any way, but 
a loan pure and simple, for which a promissory note 
is given to be repaid without interest.
Athletics, as well as all student activities in 
general, are vitally connected with the success of 
the institution of learning supporting them. We 
venture to say that there is no college in the country 
that could keep in operation with the full number of 
students in the courses, or keep up the standard of 
the students and their work for three years if ath
letics and student activities were even so much in
terfered with as to be seriously hampered in any 
way. And this is only one way of looking at the 
thing. We have heard it said that over half of the 
benefit of a college education is obtained outside 
the class room simply by coming into intimate con
tact with the other men. What would draw them 
together in an informal way if there were no student 
activities? Now, athletics forms one of the most 
important of the student activities, and from the 
foregoing it can be seen what harm would be done 
by cutting the season in half, and having that half 
away from home. It simply cant be done, and it 
isn't going to be done either. Nothing like this has 
ever fallen down before, and it cant fall down now, 
because there are Tech men behind it.
It is very seldom that we get at all sentimental, 
but when we do we mean it. If there is no other 
reason w'orth considering, what wrould you as a Tech 
man, proud of your school, proud of their clean and 
manly athletics, and proud in every way of being a 
Tech man, think of having every school and college 
in the country know that the plan for getting a new 
field hac*-been allowed to slip through and go off in 
a corner and curl up and die? There is only one 
way of preventing that very thing from happening, 
and that is GET BUSY.
Did you notice how wide-awake Silent was in

The Plebe Class wishes everybody a Merry Xmas 
and a Happy New Year.
It is earnestly hoped that everybody's smiling face 
will be seen again next term.
Nat Brown took the part of a drowning man in 
the lecture last Wednesday morning. Nat is some

The Plebe basket-ball team played the Sewickley 
High School five at Sewickley on Saturday, Dec. 12. 
Although the team has had little or no practice, they 
put up a great game. Brown, Keally and McCollum 
played a fast game throughout. Holiday and Allowelt starred in the second half. The team made a 
fine appearance, due to the kindness of the Elec
tricals in loaning the team their new suits. The 
team is very grateful for this favor. Tech rooters 
were out in full with Nicols as cheer leader. The

THE NIGHT JOURNEYMEN.
Mr. Haas, of the Sheet Metal Works, is kindly re
quested to explain his absence from the smoker, 
held by the Crafsman Club, Friday evening, Dec. 11, 
1908, as the supposition is, he was entertaining his 
lady friend.
J. E. Brown, Electric Mining, 09, was elected 
president of the Journeymen night classes, Tuesday 
evening, November 25, 1908. The Bricklaying class, 
consisting of Messrs. Haas and Rawlings, held their 
first smoker Thursday evening, Dec. 10, 1908, Mr. 
Rawlings furnishing a box of cigarettes.
THE CRAFTSMAN CLUB.
The talk given by Dr. Bradley Stoughton, under 
the auspices of the Pittsburg Foundrymans Associa
tion, at the Fulton Building, in this city, Monday 
evening, Dec. 7, 1908, proved to be both interesting 
and beneficial to the members of the Club present, 
as he spoke on "The manufacture of steel castings, 
the data referring to the Bessemer Converter, Acid 
and Basic Openhearth, Crucible and Electric Fur
nace Processes of making steel. The acid, taking the 
cost of maintenance into consideration, proved to be 
the most favorable. His stereopticon views of the 
Bessemer Converter, Acid Openhearth, Tilting Bassic 
Oi>enhearth and the Electric Furnaces used by the 
Diston Hand Saw Company are excellent. He also 
showed a sectional view of a charge w'hen boiling 
gently and the condition when boiling violently dur
ing oreing. There were quite a few good talks given 
by prominent men of the local foundries.
We were met in the lobby of the Fulton Building 
and taken to the Engineering rooms on the eighth 
floor by Mr. Day, who is deserving of much credit 
for the efficient manner in which he chaperoned the 
party. Among the members present were the fol
lowing: Messrs. C. H. Day, instructor in Mechan
ism; J. Murray, instructor in Bricklaying; H. Zellman, A. Miller, J. P. Kelly, J. M. Knox, A. H. Bige
low, H. Pendleman, J. Rawlings, McShane, H. W. 
Menking, A. E. Haas, C. J. Haas, C. Graham, W. C. 
Appenrodt, G. H. Nye, F. A. Jamison, O. Huff, and 
Edw. Allman.
FOOT-BALL TEAM ENTERTAINED.
On last Thursday evening Hittner, captain-elect of 
the foot-ball team, entertained the team at dinner. 
Besides the team the coaches and a quartet of the 
Glee Club were present. After dinner the evening 
was spent in endeavors to fathom Mr. Snitjer's 
tricks, and the quartet rendered several selections 
and the teamwell, render is the word to express 
what they did to some of our school songs. Every
body enjoyed themselves and all united in voting 
Hittner as good an host as he is foot-ball player, and 
thatt going some.
GLEE AND MANDOLIN CLUBS.
In order to be better prepared for playing at the 
Pittsburg Country Club next Saturday night, the 
Mandolin Club has decided to hold extra practices on 
Wednesday, December 16, at 7.30 P. M., for night 
men, and Thursday, December 17, at 4.00 P. M., for 
day men. Every Mandolin Club member should be 
present at one or the other of these rehearsals. It 
is important that we make our best showing next 
Saturday, since a good reputation is essential to 
securing other good dates.
All members of the Glee and Mandolin Clubs are 
to meet at the Homewood Cemetery entrance, Forbes 
street and Beechwood Boulevard, next Saturday at 
7.15 P. M., to meet the busses for transportation to 
the club house, in full dress. A group picture of 
the Clubs will be taken during the evening.

To the Editor of the Tartan:
I should like to make use of the pages of your pa
per in order that I may express to the students of 
the Carnegie Technical Schools the appreciation 
that I feel because of the generous and open-hearted 
way in which they have received me among them.
In a great many years of educational work, I have 
never before been thrown with such a manly, pur
poseful set of young men as those I have met on and 
off the Carnegie foot-ball squad this fall. In fact my 
few minutes spent daily with your foot ball squad 
grew to be such a pleasure to me that I was puzzling 
over the matter of how I could show my apprecia
tion of having been given the privilege of working 
with the team, when I was surprised and astonished 
by receiving, as a token of your regard, as handsome 
a watch as any man would want to carry. I feel this 
beautiful token is undeserved, but that fact shall not 
prevent my wearing and showing it for years to 
come. In the not far distant future, when the name 
of Carnegie Tech stands high with the best educa
tional institutions in the land, when Techs athletic 
teams rank with the best of them all, v/hen I read 
in the papers of acts done and things accomplished 
by you young men, even you with whom I have daily 
chaffed and joked, I shall draw out that time-worn 
watch and read with proud eyes the inscription you 
so generously engraved in the back.
Boys, my home is in San Jose, California. Any 
letter will reach me if addressed to that city, but 
Jones and Alum Rock Avenue, East San Jose, is 
more specific. I have one favor to ask of you. If 
any Tech student, especially you of the squad and of 
those whom I have come to know so well, are ever 
in the west, promise me a chance to return your hos
pitality. This applies to those members of your 
Faculty who have been such good friends this fall.

12 THE TARTAN
CRUCIBLE CLUB.
Last Saturday night the Crucible Club held a 
special meeting. With the exception of the faculty 
members, who all attended the function given by 
Dr. Hamerschlag, the meeting was well attended. 
The speaker of the evening was Mr. Gardner, who is 
connected with the Paint Manufacturers Associa
tion, and is at present doing extensive research 
work on paint and on paint as a preventative of cor
rosion of steel. His subject was, Paint and its ef
fect on the corrosion of steel. The following is a 
brief resume of his talk:
The accepted theory regarding the corrosion of 
iron is the Electrolytic Theory developed by Dr. 
Cushman, of the Agricultural Department. When 
steel is immersed in water a current of electricity 
is set up, due to the partial dissociation of water 
into hydrions H-f and hydroxylious (OH). This 
is due to the presence in the steel of substances like 
manganese and carbon, which act similarly to the 
negative pole of a battery.
In the electromotive series, iron is positive to cop
per and has a greater solution tendency. The iron 
therefore goes into solution and the copper is pre
cipitated as metal. This is analogous to the solu
tion tension or tendency of a solid to pass into the 
dissolved state on the one hand and the osmotic 
pressure exerted by a dissolved substance on the 
other.
The hydrions act similarly on iron as copper, and 
whenever hydrogen in the ionic state comes in con
tact with iron, the iron receives its positive charge 
from the hydrion and goes into solution as Fe 
(OH)2. In the presence of oxygen, this will oxidize 
to Fe2(OH)6. The hydrogen, of course, is converted 
from the ionic state to the atomic and then to the 
molecular state.
These phenomena may be proven in the following 
way:
Prepare a 5% solution of agar-agar containing in 
solution a little of a mixture of potassium ferric-yanide and potassium ferro-cyanide, and a few 
drops of phenol-phthalein. While still warm pour 
into a crystallizing dish a layer of the agar-agar 
solution and let it solidify. Place a clean piece of
steel on the layer and pour over it an
other layer of the agar-agar solution until the 
steel is just covered. In about five minutes beauti
ful blue and red spots are seen to form on the sur
face of the steel. The red spots are indications by 
the phenol-phthalein of the presence of hydroxylions 
and the blue spots indicate the hydrions in the fol
lowing manner: When the iron receives its positive 
charge from the hydrogenious, it goes into solution 
as ferrous iron. This immediately reacts with the 
potassium ferri-cyanide to form Prussian Blue.
The speaker then dwelt at length on the effect of 
various pigments on steel.
It is a well known fact that when steel is im
mersed in water corrosion immediately sets in, and 
within a few days the water becomes a leep brown 
and rust is deposited at the bottom of the containing 
vessel.
Mr. Gardner noticed that a weak solution of potas
sium bichromate will inhibit rusting. He therefore 
prepared about seventy-five pigments and sent them 
to Dr. Cushman to determine their effect on steel. 
Of the seventy-five zinc chromate entirely prohibited 
corrosion, while carbon was the worst corroder of 
all, the steel immersed in it having lost fully threetenths of a gram. It should be noticed that, at the 
present time most of our iron structures are painted 
with carbon paint.
Mr. Gardner concluded his very interesting talk by 
explaining the aims of the fence tests and what it 
will ultimately mean to the paint manufacturer and 
the public at large.
W. I. S., 08.
Flat cars from which spoil is plowed on the Lidgerwood system of the Panama Canal are now being 
provided with a side extension which practically 
carries the floor about 15 inches over the side on 
which the spoil is dumped. According to the Canal 
Record experience shows that this extension enebles the cars to be loaded more heavily and also 
dumps the material farther away from the trucks. 
Another improvement made in such cars is the use 
of a hinge and support which brings the aprons that 
connect two cars below the level of the floor, thus 
doing away with the trouble formerly experienced 
in having the aprons torn off by the plows.

T Id E TARTAN
The Hockey schedule for this season, while not 
finally complete, yet the present dates show our 
Varsity will meet the strongest teams in this coun
try and Canada. It is a most difficult undertaking to 
announce a home schedule on account of the indefi
nite manner in which the Duquesne Garden people 
manage affairs, and of course this- being the only 
skating rink in this city, we are entirely at their 
command.
We are scheduled to meet Pitt on Wednesday, 
Dec. 16, at 8 o'clock, and there is still some probabil
ity of meeting Renssaelaer Polytechnic Institute of 
Troy, N. Y., on Wednesday and Friday, Dec. 23 and 
25, if the Garden management are successful in 
coming to financial arrangements with them. If the 
students turn out well for the W. U. P. game, we will 
get to play Yale probably on the 31st of December 
and Princeton on the 4th or 5th of January. There 
is also some chance of meeting University of Penn
sylvania here on some Friday in January. However, 
this schedule is merely tentative and may be changed 
at the will of Duquesne Garden.
Fortunately enough oiir out-of-town schedule is 
more complete and certain. On January 5th the 
team leaves for Canada, where we are scheduled to 
play Toronto University on the 7th, Queens College 
on the 8th, and McGill University of Montreal, Que., 
on the 9th. There will be a fourth game on this trip, 
but with just whom we are not prepared to announce. 
We are scheduled to play the All-Star E\-Collegians 
of Cleveland, on January 22d and 23d. A trip will 
also be made to the East, where the schedule calls 
for West Point, Feb. 10th, Louden Field Club, Troy, 
N. Y., Feb. 11; Renssaelaer, Feb. 12; Dartmouth at 
Hanover, N. H., Feb. 13th. A game is also being 
arranged with Pennsylvania at Philadelphia and an
other College in New York.
THE HOCKEY TEAM.
TO-NIGHTS GAMES.
After many trials and troubles we are going to 
meet Pitt, on Wednesday evening, Dec. 16, and give 
them a thorough trouncing. The Tech rooters are 
placed on the right hand side, and it is hoped there 
will be a large bunch on hand, and that they will 
purchase tickets from the students in the different 
classes. We get 15% of the tickets sold at the 
schools. By turning out strong at this game the 
student body will get other opportunities to see the 
Varsity in- action against good college teams. If 
the W. U. P. numbers and enthusiasm outshine 
Tech, they will be given the preference with Renssel
aer, Yale and Princeton. So it is up to the student 
body now to do their share, and as the admission is 
not raised and we get a fair percentage of the re
ceipts. All that can possibly do so should support 
their team against W. U. P. by appearing at this 
game. There will be skating until 11 oclock.

THE TARTAN15
Mr. Boileau is a consulting engineer and an ex
pert on coal lands. He has made a thorough study 
of the conditions prevailing in and about the vicinity 
of Pittsburg and during his talk exhibited maps and 
plans shoving coal deposits in this section. He also 
possesses a fine collection of rock and coal speci
men in all stages of formation.
He emphasized the importance of the knowledge 
of Economic Geology to the Civil and Mining Engi
neer, and recommended strongly that each student 
make a study of the particular section of the coun
try in which he expects to locate. The study of the 
conditions governing our industrial developments, 
both present and future, has been neglected by the 
Universities, and he, appreciating this fact, at the 
time of the founding of Tech Schools, warmly advo
cated the establishing of a chair of Economic Geol
ogy to be included in the course.
It was particularly pleasing to recognize a few of 
our Mining students mingled with the Society. The 
social relations between those who are interested in 
Mining and the Civil Society, should be encouraged 
for mutual benefit inasmuch as the mining section 
so far is too small to support an organization of its 
own.
