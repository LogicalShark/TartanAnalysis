The varsity was worsted in a loose
ly played game of foot-ball at Meadville last Saturday by the Allegheny 
College eleven. No excuse may be 
offered for the failure of the Carnegie 
team to win, other than inconsistent 
play throughout. It was apparent to 
all who witnessed the contest that in
dividually the Tech men were far 
better, but the inability of our men to 
get together at any time during the 
game resulted in a victory for the op
ponents. Roura, who has been out of 
the game for some time, was back in 
the line-up and played a star game at 
half, succeeding on one occasion in 
getting away with a clear field, but 
was tackled from behind. Frampton, 
Hatch and Urling played well, and
old Heff was in evidence in every 
play. Benedict did well for Allegheny:

THE TARTAN
THE MIGHTY HEFF.
Come on, my brave men, cried the 
captain,
The crowd is awaiting the fray:
That big Lehigh bunch say that theyve 
got a hunch 
That theyre going to lick us to-day.
But keep up your nerve, my brave 
warriors,
And all play the best that you know, 
And theyll know, when theyre 
through, theyve been up 
against you,
And they'll have to admit we're not 
slow.
Were going to beat tar out of Le
high,
Though they've the experience and 
weight,-
So play on the level and work like 
thedickens,
And well show them a game that is 
great.
Then up spoke the great Heffelfinger, 
Just feel on my head all these lumps! 
The backs, in these days, get all of 
the praise,
The linemen get all of the bumps!
Just give me a chance to win glory, 
And let me get hold of the ball;
I'll rip a big hole, and Ill scoot for the 
goal,
And Ill score up a touchdown,thats 
all.
The first half was played,nothing, 
nothing,
The fellows were nearly played out, The bunch began to shout that theyd 
And Heff had no skin upon the left carry him out
shin, And give a big P-rade down town.
And was feeling quite savage, no
doubt. Some girls then came up, and they
kissed him;
The second half waned, and no scor- Heff stood up real straight, and he 
ing, said,
They had but three minutes to play, Im a hero, by Htn; I car. do it 
Though Tech had the ball, their chance again,
was quite small, .......
The goal line was far, far away. And then Gaston fell out of bed.
So Hendy, he whispered to Hittner, 
Let Heff take the ball on this play, 
ixe may win the game, and twould be 
a great shame 
To throw such a big chance away.
The quarterback gave out the signal, 
Guards back, and Heffs heart gave 
a jump;
He said to himself, Ill be laid on the 
shelf
If I dont give old Lehigh a bump!
The ball was passed back and he 
grabbed it 
And rushed like a bull for the line. 
They tried to resist, so the hospital 
list
Was increased from but four men to 
nine!
He ran like a deer for the goal line 
To score up a touchdown for Tech; 
He carried three men on his beltstrap.s, by Hen,
And one that had straddled his neck.
A hundred long yards did he travel, 
And finally touched the ball down,
Taxation and Representation.
An exchange tells of a modern ap
plication of the principle upon which 
our government has been built up: 
Some years ago the selectmen of the 
town of Hanover, New Hampshire, de
cided in their wisdom, to collect a poll 
tax from every Dartmouth student of 
l^gal age. The boys said nothing to this, 
but decided that if they paid taxes they 
would also vote. So they turned out in 
full force at the annual meeting. Hav
ing strength enough to secure control, 
in less than five minutes they had elect
ed students to the positions of moderator 
and clerk. Thirty minutes from the 
time the meeting was called to order the 
town of Hanover had gone on record as 
having voted to build a brick schoolhouse, five hundred feet long, ten feet 
high, and two feet wide, and to build 
a plank walk from Reed Hall, in Han
over, to Lebanon, in which town was a 
female seminary. The tax collector did 
not trouble Dartmouth students for 
many years after that.

THE TARTAN5
Technical Education.
It is not so very long ago that en 
gineers and mechanics were divided 
into the two classes, the so-called 
practical and theoretical men. 
Each of these looked down upon the 
other, the theoretical man considering 
the practical man as a sort of greasy 
mechanic, much in the same super
cilious manner in which line officers 
in the navy still look down upon the 
members of the engineer corps; while 
the practical mechanic considered the 
possessor of a technical education as 
a man of high science, wholly worth
less when any real work was to be 
done.
Time has wrought its changes, and 
today the latest developments of the 
science of engineering find their way 
almost at once into the practical and 
commercial industries, and things 
have to be done which were unknown 
but a few years before, and of which 
the old-time practical man is neces
sarily ignorant.
At the same time, transformations 
are going on in shop practice and ma
chine methods which render much of 
the old laboriously acquired shop ex
perience obsolete. The apprentice, 
after he had served his initiation in 
sweeping and cleaning up, was for
merly introduced to the chisel and 
hammer, and allowed to bruise his 
knuckles learning how to handle 
those once essential tools. Later 
came a course in filing and fitting, 
and with all this he was supposed to 
acquire experience in calipering sizes 
by the sense of touch, in connection 
with ancient calipers and roughly 
graduated foot-rules, and thus , slowly 
and painfully to learn to do things 
by hand which are now far better 
performed by shaping and grinding 
machines, by drop press and by limit 
gauge. The practical training in the 
shop must still continue, but it now 
has to keep pace with the new tools 
and improved methods which are 
placed ait its disposal.
In the meantime, the theoretical 
man has had to face changing meth
ods and appliances. The technical 
school cf today has to fit its stu
dents to fill the jobs which are await
ing them as they are graduated from 
their studies. Formerly the young 
graduate often found it wise to keep
his mouth closely shut as he went 
about looking for a start in life, other
wise he found it an adverse recom
mendation in the eyes of many em
ployers. Today the professor of en
gineering is sought by the employer 
and urged to supply young gradu
ates for immediate and active shop 
service.
The causes for this change of 
opinion are to be sought on both 
sides. We have already seen how 
the changes have occurred in the 
shop, and the developments in the 
technical school have been no less im
portant. Theory is taught indeed, 
but as a means to an end, and not 
as all-sufficient in itself. Mr. Swin
burne has effectively labeled what 
was once known as pure science by 
the much more vigorous title of 
raw science, as a thing incomplete 
until it is applied to some useful end, 
and today engineering is considered 
as synonymous with applied science.
Under such conditions the material 
prosperity of a country is closely 
bound up with the prosperity of its 
technical schools and colleges, and 
these institutions are taking their 
proper position in the community as 
places where young men are taught 
to do things, to add to the wealth of 
the world by developing its material 
resources, and to raise the standard 
of human existence by their efforts.

EDITORIAL.
It is the expressed belief of a large 
number of students that nothing 
could be done which would so help 
toward the solidification of spirit at 
Tech as a daily gathering of all the 
students. It seems to many that an 
assembly every morning would do 
more good by fostering a genuine 
feeling of fellowship than the loss of 
the twenty minutes or half-hour from 
the daily grind in laboratory, shop or 
recitation. It would give a chance for 
the expression of those things which 
would bind together the undergradu
ates as nothing else could do.
So large a number of the men seem 
to be favorable toward this idea that 
an attempt will be made to place a 
petition in the hands of the faculty, 
signed by every student in the school.

On Monday afternoon the Juniors 
got word that the Plebes were to 
hold a banquet on last evening. 
Of course President Martin could 
not be allowed to take part, for that 
would be against all rules for Plebe 
conduct. Consequently Martin was 
called down to the store room at 
about 3 oclock P. M. on very urgent 
business. He was then captured and 
carried away to some place unknown 
to his classmates and to the rest of 
the Juniors.
The Plebes did not notice his ab

his whereabouts.

JUNIOR ELECTRICALS WIN.
Last Thursday afternoon another of 
those informal foot-ball games be
tween sections took place on the 
field and was finely played and better 
attended than the Varsity practice. 
The game was very interesting and 
the forward pass was used by the 
Juniors with telling effect. The Sen
iors played hard to win, but were 
out-weighed by the Junior team. 
Sprengle played a fine game at full
back and was ably assisted by a Var
sity man. It was supposed among 
the students that Varsity men were 
barred from such contests, but such 
was not the case in this game.
Sprengle made the only touchdown 
and kicked as neat a goal as could 
be desired:

The entire student body at Oregon 
Agricultural College have passed reso

consideration by the authorities of 
Amherst college, that institution will 
have a mens commons,, in the near

A meeting of Class 1910 was called 
on Monday, November 11, to decide 
finally regarding the weekly schedule 
of four nights. After the heated ar
guments, in which every student 
present spoke on the subject, it was 
decided that the present schedule be 
adopted, with the suggestion that the 
amount of outside work be cut down, 
and the time required for handing in 
notes and reports be extended. The 
president appointed Messrs. Skeehan, 
Schwartz, Burgess and Taxis, as a 
committee to call upon the Director 
and lay before him the suggestions 
of the class.

Capt. Jack Crawfcrd Makes Address 
to Tech Men.
Capt. Crawford, a noted scout and 
Indian fighter, made an interesting ad
dress to the day students last Wednes
day afternoon. At the request of 
Messrs. Kesszthelyia and Zeller, in
structors in the School o. Applied De
sign, Capt. Crawford, who numbers 
these gentlemen among his warmest 
friends, kindly volunteered to address 
the Carnegie men. Capt. Crawford has 
had an interesting career. He was 
raised in the coal fields of Pennsylva
nia and worked in the coal mines until 
after the war broke out. His father 
went out for the first 3 months ser
vice and he enlisted himself in the 
same regiment in 1863. His father was 
twice wounded and so was he. When 
he enlisted he had to make a cross, as 
he could not sign his name. He was 
never in school but four days in his 
life, and says he was licked every day. 
He ran away from school because he 
feared they would kill him before 
they would educate him. He went 
west and worked as chief of scouts 
for the Black Hill Rangers in 1875- 
76. He was of the pioneers that 
opened the Black Hills to civilization. 
When General Custer was assassi
nated he was on his way to join him. 
He later became Chief of Scouts with 
General Merritt in the 1876 campaign 
against Sitting Bull. Later he was 
Chief of Scouts with the army under 
Generals Hatch and Buel in the Victorial campaign. He was wounded 
twice in the campaigns in New Mex
ico and Arizona. After the latter 
campaign he was appointed Post 
Trader by Robert Lincoln, Secretary 
of War. When Gen. Harrison became 
President, he appointed Capt.  Craw
ford Special Agent in the Department 
of Justice, and he later went on the 
platform as an entertainer, as at pres
ent. He spends his vacations at his 
own mining camps in New Mexico, 
where he has extensive copper and 
lead mines.
The old scout started out by telling 
of his egotism and how it has won for 
him many times. His power of ex
pression is wonderful and truly west
ern in style, and every word he ut
tered was listened to attentively by 
the students.
Mrs. Edith Harris Scott, of Home
stead, sang two of -the poets songs 
and was well applauded. After this 
the poet delivered a little sermon on 
the evils of strong drink and of smok
ing cigarettes, which caused some un
easiness among certain portions of 
the room. The meeting broke up at 
5.45 with a rousing cheer for Capt.. 
Crawford.------o-------

Owing to the fact that, foot-bali 
practice was deemed of more impor
tance than a postponed class meeting, 
there was no meeting on the evening 
of November 13. There will not be a 
class meeting until December 4, 07, 
at which every loyal student of 11 is 
expected. A smoker and bean bake 
is to be discussed and the opinions 
of all, whether for or against, are 
earnestly solicited.
Circulation Manager Eeeken made a 
complaint to the officers of 11 that 
their class was evidently losing inter
est in the Tartan. He said in part: 
Notwithstanding the increase in 
space a.lotted to 1811, and the appear
ance of an abundance of good, breezy 
reading matter, I had been unable to 
notice a proportionate increase in the 
sales and subscriptions. This is a 
condition of affairs of which every
1911 man ought to be ashamed. In 
the cpinion cf the staff and those who 
buy copies of the Tartan, there is no 
meaner trick than the borrowing of 
a paper. The price is not prohibitive 
and the return is great enough to 
prove a bargain at three times the 
present cost.
With the discontinuance of the 
weekly rough hcu.e,' many will as
sume that the 1911 page of the Tar
tan will dwindle to a mere advertising 
notice of the next class meeting, or 
what was done at the meeting. This 
is sure to come to pass if the contri
butions do not come hi greater num
bers. To date there have been but 
two personals handed in and several 
members oi 11 have even gone so far 
as to criticise the amount and fiature 
of the news printed under the head 
of 1911. The gentlemen (?) who 
have entered these complaints have 
failed to file them at the proper place 
and their act is not a great deal re
moved from the reprehensible habit of
THE TARTAN
knocking. With the Industrials 
example of reviving the ducking 
stool for knockers, there may be 
another ducking bee, as the 11 
crowd is as a body, dead set against 
knockers.
The energetically inclined of 1911 
and 12 have turned their surplus en
ergy into foot-ball channels, and from 
all indications the contest on Thanks
giving morning will be some game.
A recent advertising publication of
fered the following, which might bear 
repetition: Pat, on learning that his
sister had given birth to a child, has
tened to offer his congratulations. 
The nurse in attendance met him at 
the door and was quite amused at his 
stammering remarks, which ran: Me 
name is Pat M. and Oi am her broth
er, an X)i wants ter know whither 
Oim an uncle or an aunt?
A student at Tech left his Chemis
try note-book lying where it was found 
by his father. The pater looked 
through it and shook his head and 
communed this-with his wife: I dont 
think that there Tech School is much

The Pittsburg Filtration Works.
The design and construction of the 
water purification plant now being 
built at Pittsburg under the direction 
of Mr. Morris Knowles, was the sub
ject of a series of articles printed in 
the Engineering Record during De
cember of last year. The plant is 
located on the Allegheny river, from 
which the raw water is drawn, and 
considerable pains will be taken in 
the final finishing to give it an at
tractive appearance. The general 
idea that has been followed in devel
oping the landscape plant has been 
to isolate the site from the surround
ings by hedges and to plant hardy 
shrubs and trees of slow growth, 
which will require pruning only at 
considerable intervals. All attempts 
at elaborate decorations, such as 
flower gardens, set plants and foun
tains, have been avoided and the 
money will be spent on more perma
nent work. A growth of heavy tim
ber on the hill back of the site will 
be retained. The entrances to the 
filter galleries from the drive over 
the Allegheny water main will be re
lieved by shrubbery. The entrances 
to the plant will be closed by iron 
gates carried by large stone piers. 
All overhead wires have been avoid
ed by a system of underground ducts, 
in which wires for all purposes will 
be carried.
The water is taken through an in
take from the river into a low-lift 
Ross pumping station. The pumps 
deliver it to the central sedimenta
tion basin, which has a capacity of 
20,000,000 gallons and is flanked on 
either side by two much larger sedi
mentation basins, the three having a 
total capacity of about 150,000,000 
gallons. The water will pass from 
them to the filters, which are covered 
and lie on either side of Allegheny 
river, along which runs the Allegheny 
city water main. The filtered water 
flows into a covered reservoir built 
along the bank of the river, from 
which it passes through parallel twin 
steel conduits to the Brilliant pump
ing station of the Pittsburg water
works. The plant, will have a net 
capacity of approximately 100,000,000 
gallons of water per day under nor
mal operating conditions, with a max
imum rate of 3,000,000 gallons per 
acre per day.
The filter beds are 46 in number, 
each with a net filtering area of one 
acre. Beds are arranged in eight 
rows transverse to the Allegheny 
Drive, with a covered pipe gallery 
31 feet wide in the clear between 
each alternate row of filters, or four 
galleries in all. These galleries are 
approximately 1.000 feet long with the 
exception of the one at the end, and 
are divided in half transversely by 
the roadway over the G0-inch rising 
main of the Allegheny waterworks. 
The filters are entered from the gal
leries and all sand washing will be 
done in them, special appliances 
having been built to handle the sand 
economically between the filters and 
the washing apparatus. No storage 
for dirty sand is provided, for the 
system of operations will involve the 
continuous removal, washing and 
restoration of the sand. Provision 
has been made for warming these 
galleries so that all work connected 
with the maintenance of the plant 
can be done without interruption 
from the cold.Exchange.

ing attention, which, by the alchemy 
of egregious self-esteem, they trans
mute into imaginary admiration. We 
all know the rah-rah boy. He is the 
boy who wears the turned-up peg 
trousers that strike him above the 
ankles, thereby displaying hosiery 
that fairly shrieks. His coat is pad
ded to give athletic breadth to his 
shoulders, and a safety pin of famil
iar domestic design holds the soft 
collar in place. But his hator that 
which passes for a hatis the crown
ing badge of adolescent dotage. Its 
a flabby felt, of any color, but with 
a section turned up for rakish effect, 
and the whole costume is set off by 
the hatband, which is a wierd and as
tonishing circlet of prismatic strata 
like the crest of a scarlet flamingo.
The downy-faced lad in the costume 
described is an all too familiar object, 
and he is indulged by the wiser and 
older ones because of his innocuous 
innoeence, and for the better reason 
that we are wont to smile in furtive 
remembrance of the time, more or 
less remote, when we, too, were of

A False Alarm.
On Monday afternoon consider
able excitement was caused by 
the sudden and noisy appearance
cf the fire department at the schools, j 
Some unknown person walking along ; 
Fifth avenue saw the flames shoot
ing out of the foundry cupola and 
immediately sent in an alarm from 
ti^e nearest box, and to make the 
matter sure he went to the nearest 
telephone and informed the firemen 
that the fire was at the Tech School. 
They did not have to show permits 
to cross the bridge, neither did they 
walk the horses across. Even the 
patrol came along and some wag 
started the report that they were 
after the naughty Juniors.
PLEBES LOSE TO WELLSVILLE.
While the Varsity was busy at Al
legheny on Saturday the Plebes were 
hard at work trying to beat Wellsville. Agnew put up a star game for 
the Plebes and scored a touchdown 
in the last thirty seconds of play by 
securing the ball on a fumble and 
sprinting thirty yards. The Plebes 
other touchdown was obtained by 
Mead kicking the ball over Wellsvilles line where Agnew fell on it.
McLain played well for Wellsville 
and made a twenty-five-yard run for a 
touchdown:

unless some very radical reform can

16THE T ARTAN
| NINETEEN TWELVE |
J. Howard Tritschler, Correspondent.
Last Friday the class of 1912 held a 
meeting, during which much impor
tant business was transacted. The 
meeting was called to order by Chair
man Helm, who in turn appointed his 
secretary. The session was full of in
terest and many of the class who 
failed to attend missed a lively meet
ing. The following students were ap
pointed on the Constitution Commit
tee by Chairman Helm:
Section AFarrell, Newell.
Section BGrap, Sample.
Section CHoffman, R. Griffiths.
Section DKeagy, Meach.
J. Howard Tritschler was appointed 
to look after 1912 interest in the Tar
tan, and he no doubt will certainly 
claim his share for the class.
Are you aware of the fact, boys, 
that the 1912 night students have sev
eral star basket-ball players in their 
numberRalston, of Young Ameri
cans, and Davies, of Young Ameri
cans, also two players from the Zion 
Council team? How about getting 
started?
At this issue of the Tartan it has 
not been ascertained who the assist
ant correspondents are to represent
1912, but Tritschler can be relied 
upon to have a dandy and sharp-eyed 
staff.
We would suggest that every one 
purchase the new postal cards, on 
which is the emblem of C. T. S. Why 
not sew it below your coat pocket?
The 1912 foot-ball team will give 
the 1911 combination a hard game 
when they clash on Thanksgiving 
morning. Nineteen Twelve has very 
good material, and if it continues to 
improve at the present rate, Captain 
Newell will carry 1911s scalp in his 
belt. All are working zealously, and 
by the time Thanksgiving arrives all 
will be in the right shape to await the 
blow of the whistle. The class rush 
has given both 1911 and 1912 the idea 
that they cannot be beaten. You can
wager that 1912 will be ready to pro
tect their interests when the occasion 
arises.

A New System.
The following choice bit of wit was 
penned by a draughtsman employed 
at the Bethlehem Steel Works to cel
ebrate the introduction of a new sys
tem in the office and works of that 
company. It fell into the hands of a 
member of the faculty, who very 
kindly contributes it to the Tartan:
System.
I dreamt I lived in a sectional house 
And rode a sectional hoss,
And drew my pay in sections from 
A sectional section boss.
Oh, isnt it great to be up to date, 
And live in this year of grace,
With a system and place for every
thing,
Though nobody knows the place?

Oh, isnt it great to be up to date, 
And live in this year of grace,
With a system and place for every

Though nobody knows the place?
Weve an index card for each thing 
we do,
And everything under the sun;
It takes so long to fill out the cards, 
We never get anything done.
Weve loose leaf ledgers for saving 
time,
The Lord knows what they cost, 
When half our time is spent each day 
Hunting for leaves that are lost.

And make us swear and cuss,
When we are not dictating to them, 
Why, they are dictating to us.
And sectional this and sectional that,

I dreamt last night that I made a meal 
On sectional ham and eggs.
