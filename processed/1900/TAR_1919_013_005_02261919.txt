PENN STATE FIVE WILLBE JIHTTHURSDAY NIGHT
Penn State Has a Fast Team With a Wonderful Record
I 'What points to be the most interesting and exciting game of the 
J-ear, will take place next Thursday night at the gym. The Tech 
fibasket ball team will clash with the strong Penn State quintet. With 
the exception of the Pitt game, this will be the most important game 
I of the year. Penn State has a large Alumni in this city which is a 
great supporter of the Blue and White team.
Last year Penn State forced us to defeat, but this year there will 
be a different story. Tech has won four out of the last five games 
played. So far this year, State has lost only two games. TheseI
 games were lost while away from home at Penn and Lafayette. Re
ports from up state show the Center eountians to be just as strong 
as they were last year. At that time, they were named as disputed
champions of the State. Of last'4-----------------------------------------------------------------

On the night o March 14, the Fresh
men Class of Margaret Morrison will

Union Building. Miss Mary Kirby is 
social chairman. On the committee 
are: Harriet Morgan, Helen Adams,
Mary Little and Mary McCombs. More

Wilson at guard, Wolfe and Mullan 
as forwards. The latter two are 
classed as the best in the State. At 
cente., is found Replogle, a 6 foot 
4 inch man who was all-Scholastic 
center at Schenley High for two 
years. Killinger, a guard, is t star 
football player and a hard man to 
get away from. It is easy to see 
that our forwards will have their 
work cut out for them.
As to our forwards, have you seen 
them in action lately? With Hamman and Abrams working Thursday 
night like they did against the star 
Lafayette five, we have no reason 
to fear the Penn State tossers.
Since Coach Bianchi has taken 
charge of the Plaid, there has been 
a great change in the teamwork 
and passing. This was proved last 
Saturday* night against Lafayette, 
when every man on the team scored 
at least one basket. Captain Greatzler is putting up a fine game at

Congressman Julius Kahn of 
California and Other Not
ed Citizens Speak
The new flagpole on the right of the 
Carnegie Institute building was dedi
cated last Saturday morning with most 
impressive ceremony. The principal 
part of the program took place in the 
Music Hall.
The Honorable Julius Kahn, mem
ber of Congress from. California, made 
the principal address on What the 
Life of George Washington Means to 
Our Foreign-Born Citizens. Mr. Kahn 
is one of the living refutations of the
center, although handicapped with theory that a man born in Germany
a. sprained ankle. He has been get
ting the tip off in every game and 
should be able to get it against 
State. At the guard positions, 
Carey and Lynn have been working 
together all year. Carey held -An
derson, Lafayettes star, to one baslcet and should be able to take care 
of Wolfe, the star forward of 
State. The Blue and White has a 
strong set of subs who are always 
ready to hold down their positions.
The team is fighting for every
body in school. Let every student 
t>e there as the price is only regis
tration card and war tax. The game 
will start at 8 oclock. Thursday 
night, at the gym.
PRIZE ESSAY CONTEST INDUSTRIAL ECONOMICS
Here is a chance for the literary 
talent of our school to show itself. 
There have been many contests of a 
similar nature which have not reached 
the students. A prize of $1,000 will 
"be offerfed to the winner. This is in
ducement enough to stir up any 
cliolar to take up the pen. But, here, 
ive have something more to offer. It 
is the name of Tech. A man from 
Tech should win this contest. Think 
what it would mean! It is up to the 
individual, who feels that he or she 
can .write, to get busy. Dont put it 
'ff, do it right now. The following 
aragraphs explain fully the condiions under which one enters the con
gest:
The National Industrial Conference 
Board offers a prize of one thousand 
dollars for the best monograph on any 
one of the following subjects:
1. A practicable plan for represen
tation of workers in determining con
ditions of work and for prevention of 
industrial disputes.
2. The major causes of unemploy
ment and how to minimize them.
3. How can efficiency of workers 
"be so increased as to make high wage 
rates economically practicable?
4. Should the state interfere in the 
determination of wage rates?
5. Should rates of wages be defin
itely based on the cost of living?
6. How can present systems of 
wage payments be so perfected and 
supplemented as to be most conducive 
to individual efficiency and to the 
contentment of workers?
7. The closed union shop versus 
the open shop: their social and- eco
nomic value compared.
S. Should trade unions and em
ployers associations be made legally 
responsible?

can never become a thoroughly pa
triotic American. He was leader of 
the fight to secure the passage of the 
selective draft law. He was respon
sible for the designation of San Fran
cisco as the city in which to hold the 
Panama-Pacific Exposition in 1915.
Mr. Kahn entered the theatrical pro
fession in this country and played 
with, such men as Edwin Booth. In 
1890 he went to San Francisco and 
studied law. Since this time he has 
served in the California legislature 
and several terms in our national 
congress.
Mr. Kahn is a brilliant orator and 
held the audience by his wonderful 
personality and exceptional speech. 
Colonel John C. W. Brooks conferred 
distinguished service crosses on Cap
tain Arno S. McClellan and Lieuten
ant John I-I. Mitchener. These decora
tions were awarded by Congress upon 
recommendation of General Pershing. 
Captain McClellan, then a lieutenant, 
led his platoon into greatest danger, 
located a German machine gun and 
greatly aided in the advance of his 
company. When his company was 
forced to retire to a safer position he, 
with one other soldier, covered the 
platoons withdrawal with most accu
rate fire from an automatic gun.
Lieutenant Mitchener was decorated 
for exceptional heroism in continuing 
an airplane flight under most adverse 
conditions and with a wound in his 
leg. He continued the flight and ac
complished his mission, safely landing 
behind our lines with, his plane com
pletely wrecked.
Honorable James Francis Burke 
made a short speech in front of the 
flagpole. The base was -unveiled by 
Mrs. Charles Trunzer, sister of Thom

dier to be killed in the war.
The flagpole was designed by Mr. 
Henry Hornbostle, patron of the 
School of Applied Design. The four 
bronze medalions which decorate the 
base of the pole are the work of Sylvain Salieres, - professor of sculpture 
in the School of Applied Design. The 
medalions represent the primitive 
arts. Much of the stone modeling in 
the Grand Central Terminal in New 
York was done by Mr. Salieres. He 
is a graduate of the.Ecole des Beaux 
Arts at Paris.
Sergeant Sullivan, who acted as 
quartermaster in the S. A. T. C. at 
Carnegie Tech and who has been 33 
years in the army, raised the flag. 
Colonel Samuel Harden Church, pres
ident of the board of trustees, pre

The .flagpole,is a true credit to the 
Carnegie Institute.

ZEEBRUfiGE HERO TALKS AT SYRIA MOSQUE
On Thursday evening the faculty 
and students of the Carnegie Institute 
of Technology were invited to hear 
Capt. Alfred Carpenter, B. C. R. M., 
speaker at Syria Mosque.
Captain Carpenter was the British 
naval officer who first conceived the 
plan to blockade the Zeebrugge Canal. 
He had a great deal to do with carry
ing his plan into operation. On April 
22, 1918, two ships filled with concrete 
were towed into the canal and sunk. 
During the engagement over 500 of
ficers and men were killed. This 
blockade 'prevented 23 German de
stroyers . and five submarines from 
leaving the canal for almost six 
months.
The lecture, The Raid on Zee
brugge, was illustrated with motion 
pictures.

In spite oi. mo poem, Lord Byron 
could have known nothing of the 
sound of l'evelry by night, and 
Chasing the glowing hours with 
flying feet, because he was unfor
tunate enough not to have attended 
the Girls Junior Prom, on the night 
of Thursday, February 20, 1919. If 
the entire Junior and Sen'or classes 
of M. M. C. C. were not there, the 
few absentees are certainly to bo 
condoned with, for there was not u 
dissenting voice in acclaiming It. the 
biggest success of the Women's Col
lege Year. Some, 1 believe, even 
went so far as to compare it with 
heaven, and if1 they are not exactly 
right, at least pretty girls, pretty 
.dresses, celestial music and excel
lent eats are not very far removed 
from at least the oriental idea of fu
ture life. All of these, and a great 
deal more were to be had to the 
Junior Prom.
This event (among the most impor
tant in th year) took place Thurs
day, February 20, in the ball room 
on the third floor of the Rittenliouse 
Hotel in East Liberty. The room was 
ideal for just the size crowd that 
was gathered there, and in addition 
to having a wonderful floor for danc
ing, its attractive decorations fur
nished a charming background for 
the many-colored dresses of the 
girls, and the dress suits and uni
forms of the men. The Class of 
1920 was glad to have among the 
dancers soldiers, both those just re
turned from France, and those home 
from camp on furlough.
There was extra dancing before 
the grand march, which started 
about 9:30 o'clock, to the swinging 
music of On the Square. The 
march was walked in different forma, 
tions, care always , being taken to 
avoid stepping on a certain powder 
box and puff, which some careless 
person must have dropped at the be
ginning of the evening. Though it 
may have caused its owner (whom all 
attempts to locate have failed) some 
concern, it furnished everyone else 
with food for thought, conversation 
and amusement. The march was 
led by Miss Myrtle Goe and her, 
partner. Miss Goe is the president 
of the Class of 1920; she wore a 
very pretty light lavendar gown. 
After the end of the march the reg
ular dancing for the evening com
menced, and to the credit of RiehlH 
Orchestra (which did excellent work 
in every way), be it said thal 
throughout the evening the dances 
were long with generous encores, 
and the intermission unusually short.

GAME WAS A THRILLERFROM START TO FINISH
Team Shows Real StrengthNo Individual Star
Carnegie Techs basket ball team emerged a winner last Satur
day night, in one of the finest and hardest played games ever seen on 
our gym floor, with Lafayette College.
The Lafayette five came on the'floor first, and was greeted in the 
true Tech manner, with a long yell that started the spirit going. 
Tech entered a few minutes later and a cheer was given to each 
player. The game started shortly after nine oclock.
At the first whistle, the play started with a rush, and at no 
time through the game did the spirit seem to lag on either team. In 
the opening minutes of the game, neither team was able to keep the 
ball for any length of time.
From the first blast of the whistle until the end, the game was 
anybodys. But the plaid five were always ahead from the time that 
Lefty Abrams tossed in the first foul until the final point.
-----------------------------------------------------------------? Much credit, must be given our
team as Lafayette was touted as thoILLUSTRATED LECTURE 
ON WILD ANIMALS GIVEN TO SCIENCE
Last. Wednesday the students of 
Science School heard a most interest
ing illustrated lecture by Mr. Norman 
McCiintock.
The motion pictures illustrated tlie 
habits and actions of the animals with 
remarkable authenticity. Wild elk, 
which would probably have become 
extinct were it not for the govern
ments feeding program, were shown. 
They were shown in their native 
haunts in such a manner that a very 
good idea of their hal^ts could be 
formed.
Many of tho pictures"were taken 
with a telescopic lens, which magni
fied eight diameters. This made it 
possible to show animals which or
dinarily can not be photographed at 
close range. An example is the Rocky 
Mountain sheep, of which good motion 
pictures can seldoih bo made. Very! 
good pictures of this rare animal were 
shown.
The most interesting rool was of the 
reindeer at Fort, Yellowstone. Those 
animals come into the village whon 
their food becomes scarce in winter. 
They are fed by the government and 
by tho villagers. Soon they become 
so tame that they will oat out of the 
townspooplos hands. It was vory In
teresting to see one of those wild 
reindeer taking food out of the mouth 
of a. little child. .
The lecture and the picture helped 
all to appreciate that there really is 
some reason for the slogan, See 
America First.

Oplieleum fraternity came back 
witli a bang and held a smoker in

best team soon in this end of the 
State, this year. They had defeated 
Juniata, Pitt and W. and J. on their 
trip and were out to make a clean 
sweep.
In Coach Bianchi's team they ran 
into real opposition. They were 
played off- their feet in every minute 
of tho game; from a passing stand
point to shooting and guarding or 
everything that makes a real basket 
ball team.
One of tho largest and most en
thusiastic crowds of tho season 
packed the gym. They were con
stantly on their feot cheering, lod by 
Cheer Leader Stark. This was tlio 
first real pep showed at, any game 
this season and surely brought re
sults.
At no time was tho final outcome 
assured, although Tech lod at tho 
half way mark 22 to 18. Tho Plaid 
flvo played a game marked by co
operative team work and It would 
be hard to decide who was the. 
star. Every man on tho team con
tributed at least ono basket, while 
Abrams deserves much credit for 
Ills foul shooting, caging 22 out of 
29 chances. Ho also played a fine 
floor game, Hannnan, his running 
mato, played the floor fl.no and got 
two baskets and was ablo to hold 
his man to ono basket.
Captain Grqtzler, although handi
capped by a bad ankle, got Ills lip 
off and was nil over tho floor. Ho 
managed to tip In a basket and con
tributed greatly to tho teamwork.
Carey, at guard, distinguished him
self by covering Captain Anderson 
so well, that ho was ablo to got only 
ono basket, and tills with Schoops 
all over him. He played tho "still 
guard game to perfection and made 
the first basket of tho game on a 
long shot from the center of tho 
floor.
Lynn, at the other guard position, 
played the floor and gathered hi two 
baskets when they were needed, it 
seemed that whenever a basket was 
needed, someone always came across.
For the visitors, Keating was the 
star, getting four baskets of the 
phenomenal type. Captain Anderson 
gave a good exhibition from the foul 
line, but did not have any from the 
field, so cfosely was he covered.

FIRST PLAY OF SEASON CRITICISED BY MR. STUART
"EVERYBODY OUT
This terse little expression has a meaning that cannot be misunderstood. It meansjhat when Tech is in competition with some 
other school, it home, or within traveling distance, that everybody is 
expected to attend.
Freshmen, lets have some pep! Sophomores/ are you asleep? 
Juniors and Seniors, what kind of an example are you setting? Lets 
have Some spirit. Two years ago Tech was known all over the east 
for its spirit and now it ought not to be known to blocks., Get some 
pep. Most activities around the school except athletics and the mu
sical clubs are deaddeaddead. Get some of this old Tech spirit 
and do something. Get into somethingdo something. Since ath
letics are a schools best means of advertising and since they d'epend upon the students for support, boost them. We are students 
in a. school that is unsurpassed, a 'faculty that has no peer, and a 
student body that- -what its up to you.
A CALENDAR
Sometimes the value of a movement; is vague or even doubtful, 
but some carry will) them such a comprehensive criterion of their 
worth, that an exposition toward bringing about their adoption is 
time and energy thrown away. To the bitter class belongs the move
ment of Dean Tarboll. Nothing can be more embarrassing to an in
dividual or an organization than to find that he or it has scheduled 
an event on a night that he should have been present somewhere else.
Too often lately, has this mix-up of events taken place. Mr. 
Tarbell has volunteered his services. This opportunity should be 
taken advantage of by every one and then when we have a basket 
ball, football or baseball gameeverybody out. The Tartan will 
publish every week the calendar oL! events for the following week it* 
such information as he requests will be handed in to Dean Tarbell.

ALAN BRIGHT, Registrar.
The effective manner in which the 
effervescent fun of Sheridans com
edy was brought out by the students 
of the Drama Department last. Fri
day and Saturday nights was an 
agreeable surprise. Humor, when it 
is of that pathetic strain; comedy 
when wrought of horse-play; and 
wit when of bitter stuff are all com
paratively easy to use as media to 
make laughter; but fun, of such del
icate and line fabric as The Rivals 
is woven, requires the artist's .skill 
to create audible merriment. With 
the exception of Mrs. Malaprop, who 
literally blows her undesirable and 
unbearable personality over the en
tire company, there, are' no charac- j 
ters which succumb to vulgar and 
uproarious .rqirtli. Mrs. > Bollinger 
with her admirable voice, gave that 
role the nauseating characteristics 
the author intended it to have. Miss 
Hazel Beck, although convincing in 
her poise and excellent in her dic
tion, did not measure up to the real 
possibilities of the part, merely be: 
cause she is no more fitted or built 
for it than Mary Pickford is to play 
Lady Macbeth, and alas, what illadvised person was responsible for 
her clown make-up. Miss Becks 
rendition of Lydia Languish was 
real artistry; she merged her gentle 
romantic nature with that charming j 
determination to be true to Beverly! 
at. any cost with such ineffable 
sweetness, that the sympathy of the 
audience was , guaranteed throughout 
the performance. But whywe ask 
in amazementdoes Miss Ruth Far
mer allpw her eyes to be at most 
times covered by her eyelids? Al
though she gave Lydia the sparkle 
and life sue was born with, yet she 
covered the poor girl with a sort of 
languor impossible for a Roman
ticist to have. Lydias cousin and 
bosom companion, Julia, played by 
Mrs. Ena Lewis Willey, was not, only 
made the sympathtie advisor that 
she is, but was given that tolerance 
and forbearance which was so re
quisite with a fretful lover like 
Faulkland around. Mrs. Willey al
ways shows ability; the facL that at 
times she  seems indifferent to the 
possibilities of her role, does not in 
one whit allay the intellectual grasp 
with which she Impersonates a char
acter. She clothed Julia with 
more dense atmosphere of colonial 
days, than was elsewhere to be noted 
in the entire play. 1
II. is a joy to gaze upon talent; 
it is a pleasure to be carried into a 
veritable dreamland by the sheer 
ability of an actor. Why? Because 
that is art. And that was the sen
sation experienced In watching How
ard Smith as Sir Anthony Abso
lute. Not only did Mr. Smith give 
Ihe  delightful old gentleman the in 
disputable straightforwardness and 
Integrity ho should have, but he im 
lined him with all the fire that 
makes him such an Impetuous and 
impulsive character. The concep 
tlon of the part was mature; the 
facial expressions, gestures and voice 
inllection were appropriatethe en
tire rendition Showed the best acting 
and the highest art seen either 
night. 1-Ie was adequately supported 
by his son. Captain Absolute, por
trayed by Kenneth Thompson. The 
teasing, gallant and debonair quali
ties which Mr. Thompson gave his 
role, were pleasing to our sense and 
conception of the chivalrous and gay 
officer of Colonial days. I-Iis selfpossession and unusual easiness on 
the stage, to a. large degree, created 
the desired illusion for the audience. 
Her voice, so clear and resonant, 
yet if necessary so nicely restrained 
make a striking contrast to his grug, 
hot-tempered old father. Incidentally, 
the thoroughness with which these 
two gentlemen knew their ,lines 
should be an example and incentive 
to a part of the casts.
What an object of jest and ridicule 
does Faulkland" make himself; 
what a source he is for levity and 
wit! To be sure, his ill-tempered, 
spirit does give rise to both his 
and Julias unhappiness. This un
fortunate characteristic was strik
ingly portrayed in James S. Churchs 
rendition of the part. Faulklands 
failure as a sympathetic/ loverthe 
kind that all the world lovesdue 
to his utter inability to understand 
the female nature, was the keynote 
of Mr. Churchs impersonation. The 
portrayal was a thoroughly studied 
one; the perpetually unhappy state 
of mind caused by undergrounded 
doubts as to Julia's love and con
stancy was perceptibly indicated by 
his continual uneasiness and his 
painful mien. Mr. Churchs concep
tion was artistic, and although there 
was a slight but remote tendency to 
theatrical at times, yet. this
Acres, a likable fellOw even with 
a back-bone like jelly-fish was clev
erly done each night. Mr. Vieh 
man was excellent in conveying that 
carefree, irresponsible and yet inno
cent nature of "Acres while on the 
other hand there was in the acting 
of David S. Gaither that finish and 
polish which savoured of great abil 
ity. The humor of "Acres (quite 
unbeknownst to him, to be sure) 
was well brought out by both actors, 
by Viehman with his comical sin
cerity in -such trivial matters, and 
by Gaither with his almost uncanny 
power of suggestion.
Lucy as played by Miss Lotz, al
though clever and well conceived, 
did not have that quaint quality in 
it, which made Miss Merings rendi 
tion so sweetly traitorous. On 
Friday night, Lucy was inexcusa 
ble for her conduct, b.ut on Saturday 
night, she was forgiven every little 
double-cross she perpetrated! 
Thomas with an exaggerated idea 
of his importance, was well done by 
Mr. Hammori, his greatest difficulty 
to overcome, however, was not con
cerned with his role, but with the: 
stagehands, who during every 
street-scene caused the old 
colonial building to sway in an in
toxicated fashion, and likened the 
rear of the "drop to a boiler-shop. 
These lamentable accessories of the 
production were even worse than the 
regrettable and ill-timed applause 
which ever came forth during an act, 
like the coming of Banquos ghost! 
Such a thing as this, like th 
asthmatic laugh of "Fag will som. 
day be overcome, but meanwhile 
we must perforce allow our thoughts 
so deliciously disillusioned by so fine 
and well conceived a production, to 
be abruptly and lamentably inter
rupted.

Frances nodded.
He was my uncle," B contin

years ago I went down to visit him on 
his farm. He was a pretty cranky sort 
of a fellow, but good hearted, just the 
same. There was a family down the 
road who used to supply him with 
milk. A little dark-haired' girl used 
to deliver it every morning. One morn
ing she was late. He was terribly 
cranky ; he told her that she ought to 
buy an alarm clock to wake her up. 
In her. haste and confusion she drop
ped the milk. I felt sorry, but I 
knew my uncles disposition, so I had 
to keep still. I left the next day. but 
I found out her name. When I came 
back the next year she had left the 
village.

Frances K------ simply detested her
alarm clock. Every morning it brought' 
Ivor back from- dreams of green fields 
and babbling brooks to brick tenement 
houses and city noises. Furthermore,
it impressed on her that R------ & Co.
expected every clerk behind the coun
ter at S :30 sharp.
Although the mirror said her face 
was getting thinner, Frances blamed 
It on the new style of hairdressing, in 
another ten days she would have her 
weeks vacation, while afternoons in 
the park would soon put the color In 
her cheeks again, she told 'herself.
She wondered if David B-------; the
new manager, noticed. Frances smiled 
afterwards. .'lust as If he could keep 
track of a half thousand salesgirls 
tired looks.
Supposing he did ask her to share 
his umbrella to the elevated station the 
last rainy eveningIt: merely showed 
he was a gentleman. Nevertheless, she 
knew she was about the last girl to 
leave the store.
"Guess youll have to-set your alarm
clock a little earlier, was Mrs. H------s
greetings as Frances came down late 
to breakfast.
Scarcely ten minutes after her ar
rival at the store, David B-------- ap
proached the counter. Miss K------
he said, "we are having a special sale
on alarm clocks today. Miss M------is
out sick. Will you please take charge? 
Frances had no recollection of reply
ing. She next remembered B- ex
plaining how to regulate the clock, and 
try her utmost she could not keep the 
flaming color from, her .cheeks.
All that morning she wound and re
wound the alarm device for prospec
tive customers until now it seemed
as if her head would burst with pain
from listening to the ringing.
For lunch she had an ice cream, 
hardly nourishing to a tired clerk.
During the'afternoon how her head 
throbbed. Would the public ever stop 
buying alarm clocks? Yesm, Frances 
remembered saying, this alarm rings 
every 30 seconds, then stops, then 
ringshow warm everything seemed, 
the store was getting dark. Its funny, 
the- lights are out, didnt the' alarm 
sound far away and thentotal 
darkness. She thought she heard 
David B------s voice, but oh, so faintly.
Frances opened her eyes in a room 
she had often read about, a room that 
existed for her only in story books 
cretonne curtains, av little enameled 
hod, cool white paper and a nurse. 
Surely, this was a dream. The nurse 
explained that R------ & Co. had re
served a room at the hospital for any 
of their clerks'w^.o might become 111. 
'Phis was news indeed, for the firm 
never had the reputation of being over 
kind-hearted.
When she next awoke It was early 
evening, while the corridor lights ac
centuated the growing darkness of her 
room. Suddenly, the smart trim fig
ure of the nurse appeared in the door
way, followed by David B------. Frances

The Daily Iowan.
And, in Her Ignorance, She Had Con
sidered It a Perfectly Splendid 
Likeness.
THE GUY WE ARE TALKING 
ABOUT was BOW-LEGGED and wore 
DIAMONDS.
But he was not the sort of a fellow 
you have to call GOOD-HEARTED in 
order to have something to say about 
him.
In fact he had a lot of DOPE on 
himself.
There really was a goodly amount 
'of SAWDUST on his floors.
Consequently nfearly every one in 
college would have considered himself 
a KNOCKOUT had he been able to 
get PALLY with the GUY WE ARE 
TALKING ABOUT.
Now this LAST NAMED PERSON
AGE had, after the fashion of YOUNG 
LOCHNIVAR and the WHITE SOX. 
come out of the WEST to win LAU
RELS for himself.
He had HUNG OUT his SHINGLE 
at college with a view toward DOING 
this DEED.
Now the PROVERBIAL WEST
ERNER is ROUGH and WOOS not in 
the manner of a BABE.
But the GUY WE ARE TALKING 
ABOUT could never be BOOKED for 
a BERTH among his TRIBESMEN.
He possessed a WAY with the 
WOMEN.
He even liad_a good REEL for his 
LINE.
The GUY WE ARE TALKING 
ABOUT was, however, NEW at the 
EAST.
In addition, he was far from the 
OLD HOME TOWN.
When the time for the' PROM, ap
proached, he knew of no SKIRT whom 
he could SCHEDULE for the BIG EVENT.
As luck would have it, the MANTLE 
in the FOUR-I-IUNDRED-DOLLAR
which quite lacked' PUNCH. .
She inferred in as many words that 
she thought it PERFECTLY SPLEN
DID to get here. that the college 
really was PERFECTLY SPLENDID, 
and that truly the weather was PER
FECTLY SPLENDID.
No, the VISION OF JOY did not 
have sufficient LINE to support a 
SUIT OF SILK B. V. D.s.
When she. had LABELED the uni
verse PERFECTLY SPLENDID, her 
BOAT WAS IN.
Well, all during the PROM, the 
GUY WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 
learned how PERFECTLY SPLEN
DID is the world in general.
Meanwhile her PEDALS gave evi
dence of a great ATTRACTION to his 
CORNS.
But the time for CASHING IN 
finally came, and he PUT her on the 
TRAIN, assured that she had EN
JOYED A PERFECTLY SPLENDID 
TIME.
And then CAME A CHARIOT, 
FILLED WITH FLOWERS.
The GUY WE ARE TALKING 
ABOUT emitted a SNICKER OF VEN
GEANCE, and MADE HASTE in the 
direction of the FOUR-HUNDRED 
DOLLAR SUITE UPSTAIRS.
The POSSESSOR OF THE PHOTO
GRAPH put up a fruitless YELP FOR 
SUCCOR, and then underwent 
RAPID DEATH.
Aud thus the GUY WE ARE TALK
ING ABOUT becomes the GUY WE 
WERE TALKING ABOUT.

FAIR DAMSELS came flocking in 
from WIDE AND FAR.
The GUY WE ARE TALKING 
ABOUT was at the station EARLY 
AND BRIGHT, all ATWITTER at the 
expectation of LOCKING HORNS 
with the VISION OF JOY.
But lo! When she was led up to 
him, he was STRICKEN by a feeling 
similar unto that EXPERIENCED by 
a youth who has just been CROWNED 
by a WREATH of the justly famous

In the American Magazine a writer 
says: "Heros a funny thing, by the 
way, that Ive noticed about hotel 
guests: You leave a soiled towel In a 
room and 'lie guest will probably com
plain. But you can leave a bucket of 
paint and a paper-hanger's scaffold In 
the hallway, and compel the guest to 
crawl under a sl.epladder lo get lo his 
room and he will put up with II: cheer

with that. It doesnt cost much to 
make over a carpet so that a bare spot

Looking It Up.
He was of that type of genteel beg
gar that puts up a front, as the fel
lows say. His face had more tears 
in it than a cemetery, and he was just 
getting ready to tell his down-and-outers tale when the man at the desk 
reached Into a drawer and brought 
forth a dictionary, placing it in front 
of the appealing one. What do you 
wantsympathy?"the man at the 
desk asked. Yes, sympathy," was the 
half-sobbed reply. Look In S for it. 
I saw it there the other day. The 
sympathy chaser grunted and headed 
for the door. He wasnt looking for 
work, just sympathyin the form of 
a'piece of loose change.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx*

INDUSTRIES ASSEMBLY FULL OF REAL SPIRIT
Tech may well be proud of the spir
it displayed at the last assembly of 
the School of Applied Industries. Every 
man Is willing to do his best to 
help boost athletics here In Tech. Mr. 
Oakley, who Is a great promoter of 
this true spirit, had some notable 
criticisms to make. He mentioned the 
fact that on the night of the West
minster game, there were two school 
dances. Design School and Forbes 
Hall both picked that time for their 
festivities. This, of course, greatly 
diminished the crowd at that game. 
It in entirely out of order for any 
school organization to hold any kind 
of a gathering that'would tend to keep 
one man away from our games.
Mr. Avery brought it to the atten
tion of all that there were special 
seats provided for faculty and seniors 
in the School Restaurant. It is hoped 
that none but faculty and seniors will 
occupy these seats. Mi-. Ritter an
nounced that the clubs and societies 
of Industries were not stepping up as 
lively as they should. Such a state as 
this will easily be remedied.
Before the assembly adjourned, a 
very interesting set of lantern slides 
were shown on the screen. The pic
tures were entitled Americas An
swer.

"Its just like home; Im surely com
ing again, was the universal attitude 
of the crowd that attended the stu
dent reception given at the Oakland 
Community House, 3904 Forbes street, 
on last Friday night, February 21. The 
commmittee on management from 
Tech was composed of Miss Margaret 
I-Ioldeman of M. M. C. S. and Mr. John 
Leonard of Science. A trio from De
sign, composed of Miss Frances Levenson, Miss Napier and Miss Mainer, 
furnished the music. Refreshments 
were served and a general good time 
enjoyed. It would be unfair to tell 
how late some of the intellectuals 
stayed. Finally they were told that 
the next big function would be on or 
about St. Patricks day, so they decid
ed to go home and work to keep from 
flunking before that date.

The Mellor (I-Iall girls are justly 
proud of their Freshmen, They show
ed their originality and thoughtfulness 
in planning and carrying out a Valen
tino dinner for the girls of the upper 
classes. The tables were attractively 
set and decorated with red (lowers 
and streamers. Each girl found a 
heart at her place with some suitable 
slam written in verse, Thcfyi were 
read aloud during the course of the 
dinner and caused much amusement. 
These Plebes are showing the right 
pep and spirit and if it is carried over 
into their school work they need have 
nothing to fear.

Punch was served between dances,
and after ten dances and one extra, 
the company went downstairs, where 
supper was served at small tables,
in an artistic little diningroom. Sup
per consisted of chicken salad and 
bread and butter sandwiches, ice
cream and small cakes and coffee,
which may have been one of the rea
sons a goor times atmosphere seemed 
to pervade the room. After supper 
the company again assembled in the 
ball room, where delight in dancing 
continued unabated. Many people 
spoke of the beauty of the dresses, 
and the lovely color contrast they 
afforded to each other. Pale blue, 
lavendar, gold and victory red, 
were popular shades. In short the 
one Haw in the evening was that the 
Junior Prom really had to come to 
an end which came a little after 2 
a. hi. Oh, why not have a Junior 
Prom at least ortce a week, one won
ders?

Miss Sibley (Honorary Faculty Mem
ber of the Class of 1920) and many 
others of the faculty were present. 
Mrs. Hamerschlag wore an attrac
tive gown of soft white material, 
Miss Sibley wore a gown of lighter 
shades, shading into "victory red, 
with slippers to match. Miss Ginette Le Clere, French student at 
Tech, was guest at the Prom. She 
wore a dress of fine blue material, 
over pink satin.
Patronesses of the Prom were: 
Mrs. Hamerschlag, Dean Steed, 
Miss Sibley, Mrs. Vermorken, Miss 
Parry, Miss Sturtevant, Miss Pope',

C. W. SPROULL TO BE HEAD OF DEPARTMENT OF MACHINE DESIGN
It lias just been announced by the 
Deans Office of the School of Applied 
Science that Prof. C. W. Sproull has 
been appointed Acting Head of the 
Department of Machine Design. Prof. 
N. C. Riggs, who formerly held this 
position, had to give up this post ow
ing to the tremendous amount of extra 
work which he has been doing.
Have you ever been raising a rough 
house around the door of Room 120, 
Science Building, and have some big 
giant with a stately stride walk out 
and look down at you with a fiery gaze 
that made you wish you had a trap 
door in the floor to slide through? 
Yes? Well, thats Sproull. If you 
dont believe hell "climb onto you, 
ask the plebesthey know. They do 
not answer back, either. A man might 
have a chance in a battle with a buzzsaw, but with himno. Safety First: 
retreat. Nor are the plebes the 
only ones to feel the weight of his de
mand for discipline. Last year the 
Junior Mechanics were holding a glee 
club tryout in Room 117, that resem
bled the testing room of a boiler fac
tory. Prof Sproull left his class in 
Room 118. About 30 seconds later 
Room 117 was as still as death. About 
that much later he returned to 118. 
What he said to the Juniors is a mys
tery, butanyway, he must have 
said it.
But at the same time lie is a consid
erate instructor and always willing to 
help any one in his studies that will 
ask him. We welcome you as the head 
of the Machine Design Department.

The problems to be solved and difilcultles to bo overcome by the United 
States Government, during its part in 
lin' groat war were so varied that 
hardly 50 per cent of us realize what 
a tremendous experience our country 
lvas gone through.
Evidence of this statement has just 
been very forcibly brought to our at
tention by Dr. L. O. Grondahl of the 
Physics Department, who has just re
turned from Johns Hopkins Universi
ty, Baltimore, Md. He was a mem
ber of the special problem committee 
which was conducting experiments 
under the auspices of the Naval Con
sulting Board. The work was done 
at the naval experiment station at 
Annapolis and the laboratories' of the 
Johns Hopkins University.
One of the problems of this commit
tee was to invent a submarine detec
tor. As stated by Dr. Grondahl, sub
marines when in action could be de
tected by electric listeners at a dis
tance, of some 20 miles, but when a 
submarine got close to a destroyer foiinstance, and its engine stopped run
ning, there was no way to detect the 
presence of (tlie enemys craft. Dr. 
Grondahl stated that the committee 
was finally successful in making a de
tector which would indicate the pres
ence of the submarine with its en
gines stopped, at twice the distance 
required by the naval consulting 
board.
When Dr. Grondahl decided to en
ter t.he service of his country, he was 
commissioned a captain in the Ord
nance Department. The Secretary of 
War Baker, howovor, considered Dr. 
Grondahls technical knowledge and 
practical experience so valuable, that 
by special dispensation he was reliev
ed of his lutles1 as ordnance ollleer 
and put on this special problem com
mittee, the work of which has just 
been discussed.
We are glad to welcome Dr. Gron
dahl back lo Tech and we wish lo 
congratulate him upon the excellent, 
way in which he served the United 
States in solving some of its many 
difficult problems,.
Be true to your word and your work 
and your friend.John Boyle OReilly.

SCHOOL NOTES.
McFeaters was around school last 
week saying Hello to old friends. 
Feet was most noted as a l'usser 
and football man.
The Design School, Costume Ball, 
to be called the Fete Fantastic, will 
be held on Thursday, March 27. The 
committees in charge have announc
ed the final arrangements, and these 
plans show that no efforts hive, been 
spared to make the ball a success. 
The style will be extreme Oriental, 
which includes Chinese, Japanese, 
Javanese, Hindoo, Indian, Egyptian, 
Persian, Arabian, Turkish and Sy
rian.
Every detail has been worked out 
with the idea of making the ball an
other Arabian Night, far more won
derful than those of the Fairy Tales. 
The decorations, the costumes, the 
elaborate feast to be served in the 
exhibition room, are all in keeping 
with the luxurious splendor of the 
Far Eastern countries.
The ball is to be for the Design 
School students, former students of 
that school and alumni. The alumni 
and former, students must get passes 
to the ball not later than Thursday, 
March 20, one week before he ball. 
Tickets will cost two dollars per 
couple and no one will be admitted 
without a pass. The guests will be 
masked until twelve o'clock and 
everyone shall be in Oriental cos
tume. ,
