Saturdays contest between the Var
sity and Grove City College, resulted 
in our first defeat. The game, as was 
expected, was closely contested, and 
furnished an enjoyable spectacle for 
the large crowd that filled the stands.
Before we become too deeply in
volved, we wish to go on record as 
having said that the day was perfect, 
that the feminine attendance was 
more than numerous and correspond
ingly beautiful, and that the mascu
line portion of the rooters was sound 
of heart and lungs. The rooting show
ed a continued improvement, due to 
the mass-meeting of the day before, 
and to the unremitting labor of the 
cheer leaders.
Both teams put up a brand of foot
ball playing that was good to see. Al
though the visitors outweighed our 
team fifteen pounds per man, the su
perior speed of the home team lent 
an opposing advantage. The line men 
were the  stars of the day, showing 
a big improvement over previous 
games in defense work. Crawford, 
Taylor and Clair deserve special men
tion for consistently good work. The 
ends got away fast on almost every 
play, and featured in some spectacular 
performances. Kesselman and Atch 
were both in many of these, especially 
during the second half.
Clair kicked off to McCord on the 
20-yard line, the ball being returned
15 yards. Kiskaddon added two yards 
through the line, and on the next play 
Grove City drew the first penalty of 
the game, 5 yards for off-side play. 
Then followed an interchange of 
punts between Marks and Schmucker, 
ending with the ball in the visitors 
possession on our 32-yard mark. 
Marks made 8 yards around right 
end, and Kiskaddon added six more 
on his second try, gaining 10 yards 
more around left end. Following a 
few short gains by Marks and Acher, 
Marks took the ball for an end run 
of 25 yards, going out of bounds on 
Carnegies 25-yard line. Lucas was 
now sent in for Schmucker, who in 
turn replaced McKean. Due to the 
good work of Crawford in breaking 
up plays, Carnegie secured the ball 
on downs. Schmucker kicked out of 
danger, and the line held for small 
gains by the up-state team. The first 
forward pass, Marks to Harbison, 
netted only 5 yards. With the ball 
on Carnegies 50-yard line, Veach 
gained eleven yards in two downs. 
Marks and Kiskaddon gained eleven 
more in the next three downs, and 
the latter carried the pigskin to the 
5-yard line on an end-run. Marks 
was forced out of bounds one foot

Last week the new public school 
board was appointed by the Judges 
of the Common Pleas  Court in ac
cordance with the terms of the new 
code passed last Spring. That among 
the fifteen appointees appears the 
name of Dean Connelly is a source of 
pleasure to all. It is a fitting tribute 
to the man who has done so much 
towards the upbuilding of the public 
school system of this city.
This new board is to replace the old 
ward boards and will have charge of 
the running of the public schools 
throughout the city. The board as 
appointed by the Judges contains citi
zens prominent in many fields of en
deavor in the community and is a 
long step in advance towards the bet
terment of the school system.

FALL MIIr igCCIiiFgLc

TimNc ,
The few loyal followers of athletics 
at Carnegie Tech who witnessed the 
Fall Inter-school Track and Field 
meet were well repaid.
In spite of a heavy track, some 
clever exhibitions of speed were 
opened up for the spectators benefit, 
while the field events gave promise 
of what the contestants may do after 
practice under more favorable condi
tions.
The main object of the fall meet 
was to secure a line on the new men, 
as well as to make sure of the ability 
of the veterans.
A large number of new men 
are out for honors and will probably 
be more than able to make good. 
Among these are J. A. Cronin, a Plebe 
in the Science School; Raymond Wil
cox, a new student in the Design 
School; Yahres, from the Industries 
School; Andrews, a Science Plebe, and 
Wildburg, a Science Freshman. H. 
S. Murphy, a brother of last years 
track star, has been enrolled in the 
School of Applied Science, and will 
greatly strengthen the jumping squad, 
as he proved by winning the high 
jump at 5 feet 6 inches.
Because of the heavy track and in
clement training season, no records 
were broken, but some of the races 
were real thrillers. This was true of 
the 100-yard dash. Crawford, An
drews, Kirk and Boots qualified in the 
trials. When the final was run all 
four men crossed the tape in a row so 
straight that the judges could not de
cide which had won. The time was
10 2-5 seconds. When the race was 
run the second time, Kirk led from 
the start and finished strong, with 
Boots, Crawford and Andrews 
bunched on his heels. The relay race 
also caused some excitement, the De
sign team, composed of Jones, McCrory, Hosey and Steinmetz, winning 
from the Science team, made up by 
Murphy, Wildburg, Beeken and Craw
ford. The Industries team of McCully, Buck, Vaughn and Lafferty was 
also in the race.
The officials were: Referee, Dr. W. 
L. Savage; Starter, Mr. McCulloch; 
Timers, Steinmetz and Hosey; Track 
Judges, Frampton, Stewart and 
Franks; Field Judges, Mr. Dosey, 
Brown and Moorhead; Scorer, Kline;

In order to facilitate good fellow
ship and to promote the cause of 
commercial engineering, the students 
of the new course organized last 
Wednesday evening, adopting a con
stitution and electing officers. The 
matter of a name was allowed to pass 
until the next meeting, Wednesday 
evening, November 8th, before being 
settled finally.
The following officers were elected:
PresidentD. D. Mitchell.
Vice-PresidentGuy Kelcey.
SecretaryWard Powell.
TreasurerMayo Fitzhugh.
Executive CommitteeJohn Stew
ard, Lloyd Mclntire, and Louis Mid
dleman.
Much complaint is heard among stu
dents using the machine and forge 
shops concerning the inefficient light
ing in these places. In the forge 
room, the lights are directly above 
the anvils, so that when a person 
bends over these, he is unable to do 
accurate work on account of the 
shades. Similarly in the machine shop 
the lighting is so poor at night that 
work on the lathes becomes tiresome 
and inaccurate. In this shop even live 
wires are permitted to be around on 
the floor and near machines. These 
deficiencies should be remedied.

In this issue of the TARTAN will 
be found an account of the track meet 
held a week ago last Saturday. This 
article was written for publication in 
last weeks issue. That it was not run 
was due to a mistake upon the part 
of the printer. The TARTAN re
grets very much that the mistake 
should have been made.
o
On Saturday last our footbaH team 
suffered their first defeat of the sea
son. The defeat is harder to bear 
because it followed a string of vic
tories. Coming in the middle of the 
season, with a hard schedule ahead 
of us, we might easily make it the 
text for gloomy foreboding. Instead, 
we take the oppotrunity to express 
our confidence in the team and all 
connected with it. Every man on the 
team played well in Saturdays game; 
the team-work showed astonishing 
improvement; defects, that the week 
before were all too easy to see, were 
almost eradicated. In short, the game 
showed the effects of hard work by 
the men and careful instruction by 
the coaches.
We lost to a heavier team that could 
have played the game and earned 
their victory, deserving all the credit 
due them. But our loss does not de
tract from the credit due our men. 
They played best when things looked 
darkest, and never quit. Now, whether 
we win or lose in the remaining con
tests, we can say, We have a good 
team, while they know that the student-body of Carnegie is with them. 
The squad takes the best wishes and 
supreme confidence of the rAorAe 
with them to Meadville on Saturday.
Wre cant win all the time. Just 
wait until Saturday.* * *
It is too bad that the noble Archi
tects could not find a red parrot. With
gentleriien of their talents this small j 
delect on the part of Nature should 
not stand in the way, however.
* * *
Captain Boots remarked, among 
other things, that since brevity was 1 
the soul of wit, the Tartan was be
coming very funny.
* * *
Wrhats the use of those trouble
some monthly grades anyway. No 
one ever keeps the resolutions made.* * *
It is too bad that the Mayor did ;
not see fit to declare all of Tuesday 
a holiday. Very thoughtless.
* * *
Dummy made his mark all right, j* * *
If we had more holidays we would 
turn in more lab. reports.* * *
They say that the parrot has been
stricken dumb since entering the Ar
chitects quarters. Small wonder.

from the goal line on an attempt at 
a touch-down, and the whistle ended 
the first quarter. ScoreCarnegie, 0; 
Grove City, 0.
Blanchard was sent in for Atch. On 
the first scrimmage of the second 
period, the Plaid line held like a wall, 
but on the second try, Acher was sent 
over for the first score. Peters kicked 
goal.
Ayres was substituted for DeMuth 
before Clair kicked off. Marks was 
forced to kick after failing to gain. 
Blanchard recovered an onside kick 
by Schmucker in the middle of the 
field. Buck gained 2 yards, then a 
forward pass was attempted, only to 
end in a fozzle. Schmucker punted 
to the goal line. After a series of 
small gains and penalties drawn by 
both teams for off-side play, the ball 
was kicked by Marks to Carnegies 35- 
yard mark. Schmucker returned the 
oval by air-line to Boone on Grove 
Citys 50-yard line, where Kesselsman 
made a pretty tackle, and recovered 
the ball in the ensuing scramble. 
Schmucker pulled off a nice little 
sprint of 30 yards, being roundly ap
plauded for his foot-work. After the 
home team had failed twice to gain, 
Schmucker tried a field goal, but the 
ball went low over the line. Grove 
City failed to make the needed ten 
yards and the fifteen added for holding 
and Marks punted to his own 30-yard 
line. A forward pass was man
handled, and Schmucker made his sec
ond attempt at a field goal, ending the 
Tialf without success. ScoreCar
negie, 0; Grove City, 6.
In the second half Carnegie started 
things that made the rooters cheer up. 
Schmucker kicked off to Grove Citys 
10-yard line, Clair tackled Peters for a 
loss of five yards, and Marks was 
forced to kick out. Schmucker re
turned the ball to Grove Citys 40 
yard mark, and Buck gained 6 units
by making his own interference. Lu
cas got 10 more, and Buck carried 
the pig-skin to 12 yards from goal. 
Carnegie drew a penalty of 15 for 
holding, and a forward pass failed 
forcing Schmucker to kick. Marks 
returned in like. After an unsuccess
ful attempt, a forward pass added 15 
yards to our own string. With the 
ball on the 13 mark, Schmucker lost 
2 yards, and Balsinger also failed to 
gain. Hall was sent in for Lucas, and 
tried to work a forward pass, that 
was intercepted. Later the ball was 
brought near the enemys goal line 
again. On an onside kick Crawford 
had possession of the oval on Grove 
Citys 15 mark. Balsinger ate up 10 
yards on an end run. Crawford and 
Lucas, however, failed to gain, and 
Carnegie lost the ball as a penalty for 
holding. Marks kicked out to the 30 
mark as the whistle blew. Score 
Carnegie, 0; Grove City, 6.
In the beginning of the last period, 
Tech failed to score through falling 
down on the forward pass, and lost 
the ball on downs. Grove City took 
the ball on their own 10-yard line, and 
in two downs failed to gain. They 
were given first down on a penalty 
to the home team, with 5 yards to 
gain. The Skibo boys then held and 
Marks kicked to Carnegies . 30-yard 
line. Atch got in some good work 
in tackling the backs for no gain. A 
forward pass, Acher to Kiskaddon, 
netted 25 yards, and Peters made the 
touch-down, kicking goal. Score 
Grove City, 12; Carnegie Tech, 0.
McKean was substituted for 
Schmucker. Grove City carried the 
ball to the 20 mark and tried for a 
field goal from placement, but failed. 
Lucas kicked out of the danger zone, 
and, after a series of short gains by 
Grove Citys backs, Lucas recovered 
the ball on a fumble just as the whis
tle ended the game.

guests at a prettily appointed lunch
eon given by some of the Seniors in 
the lunch room of the M. M. C. S.

Keenans engagement. She is one of 
the girls who did not return to grad

On Tuesday, November 7th, the 
Tech Architectural Club will hold 
their next regular meeting. Import
ant business will be discussed and all 
members should be present. A special 
part of the T. A. C. meetings this 
year will be a series of addresses by 
various members. Following each of 
these will be a general discussion in 
which other members may express 
their views on the subject in question. 
In this way the members may derive 
much benefit and information of a 
practical nature. Mr. E. W. Boyer 
will deliver the address at the coming 
meeting, and present observations 
seem to indicate that his talk will be 
richly ornamented by many choice 
fragments of information, especially 
selected for students of architecture.
