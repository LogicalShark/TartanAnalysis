VARSITY FIVE TAKES RELIEF FUND FOR JUNIOR PROM ON NEW PROMEUS 
OPENER, it ili WAR SUFFERERS FEBRUARY II OF OUR (ROUP
Work of Coach Nichols in Evidence. Collections in All Schools This Week.
Saturday evening a gym-full of 
enthusiastic followers of the Tech 
basket-ball tossers witnessed the first 
game of the season go down as a vic
tory for the plaid. The game was 
fast from start to finish and seemed 
a little rough in spots, but the new 
rules will soon have their effect and 
show an improved game in many 
ways. The first half was closely con
tested, ending 16 to 14 in favor of 
the home five. Westinghouse caged 
four baskets to Techs three is this 
period, but Hines kept ahead by his 
clever foul-shooting. The next half 
witnessed the Tech tossers outplay 
their strong opponents in every way 
and the game was definitely in the 
hands of the plaid as the whistle blew 
for the end of the game.
Hines and Tumpane Star.
Hines and Tumpane did the most 
and best floor-work and their char
acteristic hard and heady playing can 
be held accountable for the victory. 
They are always following the ball 
and usually get it no matter what the 
odds against themTumpane bolting 
through the defense and Hines push
ing through it. Lewis also did some 
splendid work in his first perform
ance for Tech and is a very welcome 
addition, being a good floor man and 
a good shot. Finlay displayed the 
expected fight and should strengthen 
the team as he is fast and strong and 
heady. Meredith lived up to his in
structions to follow his man and 
kept the star opponentLangefrom 
running away with affairs.
The Visitors.
Westinghouse has an unusually 
strong team and are in mid-season 
form, having already had five or six 
encounters, including Yale and Le

The Relief Committee wishes to an
nounce that during the remainder of 
this week contributions to the Relief 
Fund for War Sufferers will be taken 
up.
The funds so collected will be ap
plied immediately to help in the re
lief of the destitute non-combatants, 
either through the agency of the RedCross or through one or more of the 
commissions for relief of Armenians, 
Belgians, Poles and Serbians.
The committee asks for the hearty 
co-operation of students and faculty, 
convinced that no other claim to our 
sympathy and help exists today which 
so strongly demands our enthusias
tic and united support.
In the Margaret Morrison School 
boxes will be provided to receive the 
contributions. In the three other 
schools special envelopes for contrib
utions will be distributed and infor
mation given as to when they will be 
collected. If any one should fail to 
return his envelope at the appointed 
time, it will reach the treasurer 
of the committee if left at the office 
of his dean.
The membership of the Relief Com
mittee is as follows:
M. M. C. S.Students: Miss Maud 
Sanford, secretary; Miss Frances 
Willis. Faculty: Miss Carrie Lyon, 
Miss Katherine Murdoch.

NIGHT SCIENCE MEETING.
Little Known of Their Record.
When the University of Buffalo five 
appears on the Gym floor next Friday 
night they will of necessity be an un
known quantity until the game has 
progressed a certain amount. The 
reason is that this year they have 
undertaken a new system of conduct
ing their athletics and are compara
tively unknown. Buffalo, however, is 
far-famed for its wonderful basketContinued on Page 8
Preliminary Plans Outlined.
The Junior Class of 1917 expects 
to stage, on February 11, 1916, at the 
Hottel Schenley, the best Prom in 
the history of Carnegie Tech. To be
gin with a record breaking crowd is 
expected and as the hall will only 
hold a limited number, it will be a 
question of first come, first served.
There will be dances enough to 
suit the most graceful and critical, 
thirty-four being the exact number, 
composed of one-steps, fox-trots, and 
waltzes in order that all will be satis
fied. The grand march will start 
promptly at 9 oclock, supper will be 
held at 12, and the dancing conclud
ed at 4.
During the supper several forms of 
entertainment will be provided, none 
of which have been decided upon de
finitely, but there are whisperings 
which make it look as if this Prom 
will always be remembered. New 
York artists will probably be used.
The programs are also of a strik
ing nature, consisting of silver Dorines with a Carnegie seal on the lid, 
for the girls and very neat and wellmade bill-folds for the men. These, 
no doubt, will be a great attraction 
in themselves.
The committee has spent a great 
deal of time on this event, and are, in 
fact, better prepared for the Prom 
than for the coming examinations. 
Their consistent aim has been to make

Much Spirit Shown.
A Mass meeting of the Night 
Science Students was held in Room 
218 on Monday evening, December 
13th, at 10:00 P. M., the obliging fac
ulty releasing us from our labors 
twenty minutes ahead of schedule.
While waiting for the assembling 
of the students, considerable enthu
siasm war raised by the execution 
of the various school cheers, W. F. 
McMichaels leading, and the singing 
of Dear Old Tech, led by Argot, 
the operatic star.
G. E. Wright, president of the 
Fourth Year Class, brought up the 
business for which the meeting was 
called. He ably exhorted the men 
to support the sale of the Thistle 
this year as never before. As he 
pointed out a yearly record of the 
doings of a college is a necessity, and 
few colleges produce at the price 
asked, one as good as or more enContinued on Page 7
INDUSTRIES PLEBES GIVE 
SMOKER.
The Acquisition of the McGinley 
Property Changes Former Plans.
Interesting Program Before Large 
Crowd.
The Plebes of the School of Ap
plied Industries tendered a smoker 
and entertainment to the Faculty and 
the upper and middle classes, last Fri
day evening in Carnegie Union.
The unexpected absence of Lewis, 
the Plebe class president, who was 
managing the affair, made it neces
sary for Vice President Keiser to take 
charge of the program and he han
dled it in a most creditable manner.
The program was opened with the 
singing of Dear Old Tech, after 
which Keiser, vice president of the 
Plebe class, made an address of wel
come. Then came a piano duet by 
Yeager and Hoxworth, which was 
followed by a talk from Hoxworth, 
president of the middle class. The 
next number on the program was a

The new outlet upon Forbes street 
has brought wonderful possibilities 
to the planning of Carnegies future 
extension. Mr. Hornbostel and Di
rector Hamerschlag have been in con
stant consultation upon the new pro
ject.
What has this new acquisition done? 
Why it threatens to place another 
quadrangle opening on Forbes street 
and at right angle to our present one, 
the building of another magnificent 
group on this property. The purchase 
of the adjoining property makes this 
all possible and is being developed. 
What these new buildings will house 
is still a question. One answer may 
be dormitories and administrative of
fices. The Tartan printed in a pre
vious issue, an article dealing with 
the mammoth building to be placed 
at the Forbes street entrance. The 
building would house all offices, clubs 
and activities, serve as a suitable en
trance arch and be possibly twenty to 
twenty-five stories in height, sur
mounted by an observatory. Such 
being the case the administration 
building, as it would be called, would 
form one side of the new group and 
dormitories and residences the other.
The new stadium would be com
pleted on its present site and extend 
high on the embankment opposite 
Woodlawn avenue, seating about 12,-
000, as well as extend completely 
around the entire field,seating ap
proximately 23,000. The new gym
nasium will be either located on the 
proposed Morewood avenue bridge 
or beneath Margaret Morrison School. 
Either position will be desirable.
The head house on the Science 
School is being studied now 
and will be built with the bridge. It

M. M. C. S. RUSHING RULES 
CHANGED.
No Plebes To Be Rushed.
At a meeting of Pan-Hellenic So:i'ty, which is composed of two rep
resentatives from each sorority, h^ld 
on Friday at 12:30, it was decided 
to rush no Plebes till the beginning of 
the Sophomore year. It is thought 
that in this way not only will it give 
an opportunity to become better ac
quainted, but it will also be possible 
to eliminate these girls from sorori
ties who drop out of school early in 
the course.

VALUE OF THE EDITORIAL.
From the articles appearing under 
this heading the entire character of 
the paper may be judged. The poli
cies, the attitude toward current af
fairs, the state of progressiveness, and 
even to the general quality of news 
on other pages may be determined 
from the editorial page.
We have strived through our edi
torial columns to promote the things 
that are of vital interest to the school 
and to the individual student. Such 
suggestions as we may offer or 
such plans as we may advance are, 
however, mere words covering so 
much space, unless the students take 
an active interest in the editorials and 
co-operate with the authors.
Some of you read the Tartan as 
if it is a duty forced upon you, but 
do you read it writh the idea in mind 
that is the voice of the school and 
is promoting policies which affect you 
personally? Our aim is, to have every 
man interested in the school in gen
eral and in some phase of activity in 
particular.
If something is advocated in our 
columns and you see no one grasping 
at its aim, get after it yourself. In 
case someone else is in the field on 
the same errand, join hands and put 
it through. That is what our sister 
publication calls constructive school 
spirit.
WHAT A COLLEGE EDUCATION 
DID FOR HIM.
A college education has one great 
evil; it sometimes has a tendency to 
make the possessor of it look too 
much to immediate ends, and not 
enough toward the final. The young 
graduate is likely to look upon his 
degree as an end and not as a means. 
An education can do nothing; it is 
a tool and the man that owns it must 
supply the motive force, else it is 
useless. Yet there are many who 
work four years toward a degree, and 
then set back with a sigh of relief, 
when they should be starting the race.
There is a man working on a farm 
near here at a salary of $22 a month 
who is a graduate of one of the larg
est universities in Ohio. He is about 
thirty-five years old, having finished 
his education about ten years ago. 
He will never draw a better salary 
than he is drawing at present. He is 
exceedingly proud of his degree and 
babbles about it continuously. He is 
naturally of an optimistic disposition, 
but he has fits of despondency. No 
doubt, he was very happy and confi
dent of success when he left college; 
no doubt, the melancholy will grow 
upon him as the years roll by and he 
continues to find himself upon the 
bottom of the ladder. For ten years, 
he has been pinning all hope upon 
that treasured degree, and he will 
doubtless continue to do so until the 
last day of the earthly existence.
What has a college education done 
for him? It has ruined him, and it 
is ruining others in just the same 
manner. Understand, we are not crit
icising education, for it benefits fifty 
where it ruins one. Still, be sure that 
you are not one of the unfortunate two 
per cent. Here the technical training 
one gets may set him on that pre
scribed track, but still we find the 
same holds true. You are now just 
in preparation and gathering tools. 
Use these tools when you get your de
gree, and not the degree.
THE CARNEGIE SPIRIT.
We stand appalled before the dis
tress and suffering in the world to
day. Millions of helpless men, wo
men, and children are destitute and 
homeless. Their very lives depend 
upon the bounty of our country. Our 
duty in the matter is plan. We must 
help, and help again. None of us 
can do much, but if each will make 
some real sacrifice, the total of our 
gifts will do much to save those who 
can not save themselves.
For years Mr. Carnegie has devoted 
his wealth and influence to the service 
of mankind. Our Institute of Tech
nology is only one of his many 
achievements in helping others to the 
realization of a fuller life. All of 
us gladly admit our obligation to 
him for the opportunity given for 
growth and self-development. We 
must also admit our increased respon
sibility to contribute our share to the 
service of others.
To make our contribution a wor
thy part of the great offering our 
country is making, and must continue 
to make, to save the lives of the un
happy millions of the war stricken 
countries, we must have the spirit 
of hearty co-operation. Here, in
deed, the Carnegie Spirit find its full
est and highest expression. Can we 
not prove to ourselves and show to 
our founder that the best and truest 
expression of the Carnegie Spirit is 
found in the words, Service and 
Good-will? Let us convince Mr. Car
negie that our hearts, too, are in the 
work to which he has devoted so 
much of his life.
ANOTHER APOLOGY.
The M. M. C. S. news, mentioned 
as lost in last weeks issue has been 
found and is printed herewith. The 
loss was entirely due to the Manag
ing Editor, and not to the local postoffice, to which much-abused depart
ment we offer our apologies and sym
pathy.
COMMUNICATIONS.
Editor of Tartan:
A recent issue of Puppet shows 
that that magazine condemns the 
quality of our new battle song. That 
is to say that the Thistle judges 
were incompetent to pass upon the 
merits of a college song and blun
dered in their attempts to do so, fail
ing, possibly, because they did not 
solicit the advice of Puppet in their 
selection. Anyhow, the song seems 
to have come across, and several hun
dred rooters have not let a distinc
tively individual artistic sense (or 
want thereof) oppose their college 
spirit. Maybe, too, when Puppet 
has been in Tech as long as some of 
the rest of us it will learn that the cli
mate of Schenley is not conducive to 
post mortems and that hammer music 
does not harmonize w'ith sweet 
labors hum.
Student.
Editor of the Tartan:
It seems almost a useless query, 
but why does Carnegie Tech not 
give its cheer leader a letter? Surely 
no man in school deserves, earns, or 
has a better right to wear the C 
of Tech than Dink Merrill. Mer
rill has not only led cheers but incitally has injected the gentlemanly 
fighting spirit we have shown, and 
which we so often have recently pat
ted ourselves on the back for.
It is not a case of following other 
schools along this line, but it should 
come from the entire student body as 
a humble vote of thanks to a man who 
has done more for what we boast of 
most, than any other man in school.
A Student.
PREPAREDNESS.
Note.The part which well trained 
young engineer can play in protecting 
America against the invading foeman 
has been discussed freely all over the 
nation. We reprint part of an edi
torial on the above subject from the 
Worcester Polytechnic Institute week
ly. The purpose of this editorial is 
not to raise the discussion of prepara
tion for war; it undertakes to discuss 
preparation for peace:
War lures men through its action 
and romance; through its mighty bat
tles of mind and brawn; peace in no 
smaller degree has its battles, also. 
Not battles with a human foe, fight
ing openly; the battles of peace are 
fought against the elements, which 
fight with more cunning than any gen
eral. Here comes in the engineers 
part:he alone can stem the terrible 
floods of the Mississippi valley; he 
alone can make the deathly desert be
come fertile through irrigation; or 
make the buildings of the country 
proof against the god of fire; or build 
the ocean-liner so that no terrors of 
the sea can turn it back. The battle 
for peace is for safety, not confusion; 
for upbuilding, not destruction.
Soldiers returning from the trench
es tell us that the romance of war 
fades quickly upon a real taste of its 
horrors. But the romance of peace 
can never be destroyed. Destruction 
soon loses its charm; construction 
ever reveals new possibilities.
War may be forced upon us; it will 
then be borne as a necessary evil. But 
in the fever of reaching a state of 
national preparedness,let us never for
get to continue our battle for peace; 
in making ready to give and take sac
rifices of-blood, let us always have be
fore us the greater good,that in a 
bloodless battle we can cherish the 
life-blood of the nation.
THE GIVERS CREED.
I believe in the blessed privilege of 
giving;
In the sharing of my goods with an
other;
In the grace that my soul gains in 
giving;
In the rare ability to give wisely and 
well.
I believe in the gift from the mind 
wise and well considered.
I believe in the gift from the heartgracious and generous.
I believe in the gift from the soul 
inspired and inspiring.
In all giving I believe that my mind 
should rule, my heart respond, 
and my soul profit.
I believe that love should move the 
heart of the giver to silent ex
pression in the gift, and when 
it does,
I believe in all gifts and in all givers.

WESTINGHOUSE AGAIN ON 
SATURDAY NIGHT.
Wilkinsburg will be the scene of the 
next conflict, at the home of the 
Westinghouse Club. Here the floor 
is much larger than the Tech floor 
and is consequently rather hard on 
visitors who are used to smaller and 
more compact playing space. But the 
Varsity should be in good condition 
then and bring home another victory. 
It is a long time since the Varsity has 
been able to win on a strange floor 
and here is the opportunity to start 
rightso come along and help out.
I like to fancy that a grateful spirit 
gives as good as it gets. Stevenson.

WRESTLING BOUTS HELD AT 
P. A. A.
P. A. A. Wrestlers Are Victorious. 
Jenkins Wins Over Alcorn.
Entered in the 135 lb. class in the 
preliminaries of the wrestling match 
held at the P. A. A. on Thursday, 
January 6th, H. Alcorn of Tech was 
unfortunate enough to draw the very 
first shot H. Jenkins of the P. A. A. 
who holds the national championship 
for that round. Jenkins also was en
tered in the 145 lb. class and out
weighed Alcorn by several pounds. 
The time required was two minutes, 
Jenkins using a right half-nelson and 
a scissors hold to tnrow Alcorn. In 
the finals of the tournament, which 
took place Friday night, Jenkins an
nexed first place in both 135 and 145 
lb. classes while A. Klinshaw was 
victorious in the 115 lb. class. Wrestlingf is undoubtedly a branch of sport 
that should be adopted at Tech and 
we are glad to see some one who is 
willing to take an active part in it.
NEW YORK STATE CLUB.
During the Christmas holidays ban
quets were held in various sections of 
New York state under the auspices 
of Carnegie Tech men. Details con
cerning those held in New York City, 
Hornell, Jamestown, and Schenectady 
are found in other columns. In Buf
falo, the principal speaker was C. B. 
Stoner, former member of the fac
ulty of Carnegie Tech. Speeches 
were also made by old grads, and by 
undergraduates. It may be said for 
the Buffalo section, at least, that 
nothing stronger than lemonade was 
in evidence, a very good time being 
enjoyed by all.
The next event being looked for
ward to by New York State men is 
a dance, the committee for which 
consists of Ed. Green, Design 18, 
chairman; J. J. Kennedy, Science 17; 
W. F. Murphy, Ind.
MUSICAL CLUBS.
Again the members of the Musical 
Clubs have set themselves down to 
hard, earnest work preparing the pro
gram for the many concerts they ex
pect to give this season.
Their next appearance will be in 
a joint concert with the musical clubs 
of the Pittsburgh College for Women, 
Friday, January 14. Our men are al
ways glad to participate in a concert 
with the fair ones, from P. C. W., 
for they know there is a good time 
in store. As usual there will be a 
reception after the concert. Now if 
you are really a youth full of good 
red blood, and w^ant to have a good 
time, journey up to the P. C. W. cam
pus Friday night. The admission will 
be small and pleasure immense.
C. I. T. ECONOMIC SOCIETY.
We are fortunate to announce that 
we succeeded in getting Mr. John W. 
Slayton as our next lecturer.
The subject he is going to take up 
is one which will undoubtedly inter
est everybody because it bears upon 
the every-day life, social as well as 
political, of every man and woman.
It is also one of which Mr. Slayton 
made a special study when he was 
running for governor of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Slayton is known as the most 
popular and most eloquent lecturer 
in this state. His lectures are al
ways educating and entertaining. His 
humor is of the best and healthiest 
type. His jokes arc supreme.
The meeting will be held in Room 
104, Applied Industries, on Thursday, 
January 13, at 4:30 P. M.
Do not forget and have a good 
time.

SENIOR DANCE.
Saturday evening at 6:30, the Sen
iors of M. M. C. S. sat down to a 
most elaborate and tasty dinner, which 
was served in the Little House. The 
table which was in the form of a hol
low square, was appropriately deco
rated in yellow an,'d white. Yellow 
tulips formed the center piece, from 
which yellow ribbons reached out to 
four tall yellow candles in glass hold
ers. The place cards were different 
species of birds which perched saucily 
on each ones glass, carrying in his 
mouth the name of the girl for whom 
it was intended.
It would be impossible to name all 
the good things to eat which, were 
providedit being sufficient to say, 
that it was a genuine turkey dinner 
with all the trimmings. The loveliest 
part of all was that everything was 
made by the girls themselves, thus 
provingv that Margaret Morrison does 
offer practical courses which are of 
genuine' value, for we all survived and 
are eagerly clamoring for another. 
Miss Belleville, honorary member of 
the Senior Class, was present.
The Senior Class as a whole wish 
to thank the Social Committee for the 
excellent way in which they managed 
the affair, and the good will with 
which they accomplished the work 
connected with it. The Social Com
mittee consists of Lila Gilmore, chair
man; Marian Pichel, Marion Groth, 
Charlotte Watson, Mary Loomis and 
Hazel Thomas.
With hardly an exception the Sen
ior Class adjourned to the Recreation 
Hall where the Plebe Dance was being 
held.
PLEBE DANCE.
Saturday evening the youngest class 
of all held their first dance in Recrea
tion Hall. Laurel was festooned grace
fully from the ceiling lights while a 
pink glare was shed over the whole 
room by the veiling of the lights with 
red crepe paper. The Tech orchestra 
furnished the music, which was very 
good.
Two features of the evening were 
the incense dance, and the novelty 
dance. Miss Belleville, Miss Collingwood and Miss Sibley acted as chap
erons.
The committee in charge were: 
Maud Fire, chairman of Program 
Committee; Helen Hunter, chairman 
of Refreshments, and Bernice Pickens, 
chairman of Decorations.
The Seniors wish to thank the 
Plebes for their kind invitation and 
also for their generous sharing of men 
and their tolerance of the pranks of 
the Seniors.
NOTED SPEAKER AT M. M. C. S.
The school was extremely fortunate 
in being able to secure Miss Jean 
Hamilton, of New York, who is the 
general secretary of the National 
League of Women Workers, to speak 
to the students on Thursday morning 
at 11:30. Miss Hamilton, who has a 
most pleasing personality, told in an 
extremely interesting way of the work 
being done by the League. Through
out the talk, many incidents from the 
experiences of the workers were cited 
which added greatly to the enjoyment 
of the occasion.
Miss Hamilton also lectured to the 
class in Community Life, this week 
on Thursday, giving much good ad
vice which would be of value to girls 
taking up that line of work.
Saturday evening, she spoke to The 
Renots Club in the Faculty Parlors, 
and was thoroughly enjoyed every 
minute of the time. Miss Stoner is 
the leader of this club.
DORM. TEA.
Miss Collingwood held her monthly 
tea Sunday afternoon. Many friends 
of the girls took this opportunity to 
visit the Dorm, and enjoy the hospi
tality of the hostess. Pink roses and 
ferns filled the center of the tea table.
ALUMNAE DANCE.
The annual holiday dance of the 
Margaret Morrison Alumnae Associa
tion was held Friday night, January 
7th, at nine oclock. The committee 
in charge was Eliza Dickey, chairman, 
Louise MacMillan, Margaret Law, and 
Irene Pond. It was very pleasant for 
the graduates of the school to be able 
to meet together once more and have 
one of the usual good times which 
accompany such an event.
CHRISTMAS FESTIVAL.
The Christmas party held on Thurs
day, December 16th, was a decided 
success both socially and financially, 
it is thought about one hundred and 
twenty-five dollars were realized. The 
principal reason for the successful 
results was the hearty and sincere 
good will of the girls to do some
thing to make the day one to be long 
remembered.
All the school organizations and 
departments were included; each one 
contributing its share according to 
its size and ability. Perhaps the 
Guild, more than any, was responsible 
for pushing the idea and getting the 
plans started. The selling of articles 
was begun in the afternoon and con
tinued throughout the evening, but 
the principal entertainment occured
Continued on Page 8
DORM. PARTIES.
The Morewood Avenue Dormitory 
had Christmas dinner Wednesday 
evening before vacation. Dinner was 
served at 6:30 and the menu stars 
were roast turkey and plum pudding. 
The tables were decorated with holly 
(no use for mistletoe) and candles 
furnished the light. Fancy little bas
kets of candy and tiny red candles in 
candlesticks were the favors. The 
whole evening was given up to a gen
eral good time. After the feast the 
girls all went to the library where 
presents were distributed from the 
handsomely decorated tree. As usual 
the evening was finished up with danc
ing. Miss Berenice Thompson and 
Mrs. Seigle had charge of the table 
and Miss Florence Burgham and Miss 
Sue Smith of general decorations.
The Fifth Avenue dorm, girls also 
had their Christmas party Wednesday 
evening, December 15. In addition 
to the above program they entertained 
about twenty youngsters by whom 
to say the leastthe evening was en
joyed.
STUDENT ASSEMBLY.
A student assembly was held Tues
day, December 14, in the Assembly 
Hall. A very important and interest
ing talk was given by Dr. Watkins, 
of the Chemistry Department. It 
seems that as more and more of the 
French territory is being taken by 
the Germans and the French women 
and children are being driven into 
Switzerland, the need of more indus
tries by which they can earn their 
living has arisen. Consequently the 
more delicate women who are unable 
to do any heavy work, have been put 
to ripping up old kid gloves and mak
ing them into vests for the soldiers. 
This has been brought to the atten
tion of Dr. Watkins and he has been 
asked to speak to the girls about do
nating their old kid gloves.
Now, girls, this will mean no ex
penditure on your part, in fact, it will 
be quite a relief to get your old gloves 
out of the way and to know that they 
are going to serve some good cause. 
Any old soft leather will be acceptable 
and bring your donations to Dr. Wat
kins office.
NIGHT GIRLS PARTY.
The Night girls held a Christmas 
party in the gym. on Tuesday even
ing, December 14. The fun began with 
games down in the Recreation Room. 
Then the girls came up to the gym 
in a procession, while the Tuesday 
Santa Claus made his appearance and, 
amid much general hilarity, distributed 
Night Club sang carols, Suer which 
the gifts from the large tree. This 
was followed or American folk dances 
and the cry of swing your corners 
and all hands round prevailed. The 
evening closed with general dancing. 
Thanks are due Miss Stoner who was 
responsible for a great part of the 
evenings fun.

more of honest fame than shedding

INDUSTRIES ALUMNI DANCE.
This coming Saturday evening, Jan
uary 15th, the first dance of the 1916 
series of the Applied Industries Alum
ni Association will take place in Car
negie Union.
All Tech men are invited. It is 
hoped that a large number will come 
out, to help make this affair as much 
of a success, as those of the past have 
been.
The assessment is $1.00. Schwarms 
Orchestra will take care of the music. 
The dance will begin promptly at 8:30 
P. M. and continue until midnight. It 
will be an informal affair.
Students Meet at Erie.
During the Christmas vacation, a 
dinner was held by the Tech students 
and Alumni of Erie, Pa., at which 
time the Erie Carnegie Club was 
formed. Clemont R. Austin, a 1914 
Alumnus of the School of Applied 
Industries, was elected Secretary and 
Treasurer of the organization.
O. D. Kingsbury, a student in the 
Middle class last year, paid us a visit 
last Thursday. Kingie who has 
been working for his father, reports 
that he will return to school in the 
fall to complete his course.
Wallace E. Alberts, 15, was a re
cent visitor to the school.
The Applied Industries Alumni As
sociation is planning a big smoker and 
entertainment to take place about the 
middle of February. Watch for fur
ther announcements.
INDUSTRIES PLEBES SMOKER
Continued from Page 1 
trip to the Beanery, where a delight
ful lunch was served, which was 
greatly enjoyed by all.
On the return to the Union, Peters, 
president of the Industries Assembly, 
gave a short talk, this being follow
ed by an excellent act of tumbling and 
acrobatic stunts by Plebes Fink and 
Stanny, who proved themselves very 
capable artists. A reel of movies was 
next in order, with songs and a mono
logue by Sox Price, following. Last 
but by no means least, came a most 
interesting talk by Dean Connelley. 
Amici was sung and then a stag 
dance held full sway, the festivities 
coming to a close at a late hour.
The program was interspersed with 
good old Tech cheers, under the di
rection of Cheerleader Jack Downes.
There were plenty of smokes on 
hand and as they were gradually con
sumed, the smoke therefrom, exceed
ed by more than a little, the proverb
ial smoke of the smoky city.
The evening was a most enjoyable 
one and all of the three hundred or 
more present had a jolly good time. 
The men who had charge of the af
fair, deserve much credit for making 
it so great a success.
Westinghouse Seconds Lose Snappy 
Game 22 to 11.
To create sort of preliminary joy 
Techs second five stepped right up 
and walloped Westinghouse Seconds 
22 to 11 in the initial game last Sat
urday. The contest was fully as ex
citing as the big game and unless 
some of the varsity men hustle it 
appears as if they will have to hus
tle to hold down their positions.
Green and Meredith played for
wards and therefore led in the scor
ing. Green caged more baskets while 
Meredith proved himself to be right 
there at shooting fouls. Craig put 
up a lively game at center while Holzworth and Williams did some nice 
work as guards.
Tech started with a flying leap and 
was three points to the good before 
their opponents started. When West
inghouse Seconds did start they re
sembled a shot from a gun for a few 
minutes and two fouls by Parsons 
plus a basket by Stiyder gave them 
the lead. But Westinghouse suffer
ed a penalty and Green put the ball 
in, tying the store. From then on 
the score zigzagged back and forth, 
neither team ever leading by more 
than a basket until the half ended 
with the score 9 to 8 in favor Tech.
In the second half the shot from 
the gun seemed to lose momentum, 
but Tech kept right on going. A foul 
and a basket by Meredith, with 
Greens score, gave Tech four points 
at the start. Westminster tacked 
three more points to their total then 
Green made two more goals, while 
Meredith added a basket and a foul,

Lecture of Archaeological Society. PROSPECTUS OF GROUP
Professor B. L. Ullman, of the Uni
versity of Pittsburgh, will give an il
lustrated lecture upon a unique and 
keenly interesting theme, In and Out 
of Trivoli. This lecture will be held 
in the lecture hall of the Carnegie 
Institute upon Friday evening, Janu
ary 14, at 8:15 oclock; under the aus
pices of the Pittsburgh Society of the 
Archaelogical Institute of America. 
This lecture will consist of plain and 
colored slides and two reels of motion 
pictures upon three main subjects. A 
thorough description of Hadrians 
Villa, the most sumptuous country 
home ever built, will be given with 
particular attention to the numerous 
art objects found there, but now scat
tered through Europe. Second in im
portance will come a study of Trivoli 
with its beautiful Villa dEste; the lec
ture closing with some picturesque 
photos of the Marcian Acqueduct, 
which runs through the Sabini Hills.
One of the most unique projects 
ever assigned to the Class A men 
is the one now under study; it is that 
of a Submarine Navy Yard. This 
project has been assigned in view of 
the increasing usefulness of the un
derwater craft and calls for the erec
tion of a special navy yard for sub
marines on the banks of one of the 
larger navigable rivers flowing into 
Chesapeake bay, being used by the 
Atlantic Submarine Squadron as a 
base for supplies and repairs.
The class B project is one both 
of an interesting and highly practical 
nature. It calls for a Supreme Court 
Room for the use of the criminal 
branch of the Supreme Court. It is 
situated in a large court house, and 
is to be decorated with mural deco
rations in keeping with the dignity 
and importance of the court.
Class B Analytique program 
calls for the solution of A Prison 
Doorway. This minor entrance be
ing used exclusively by the authori
ties as the door through which the 
prisoners are liberated at the expira
tion of their term.
In spite of the busy period preced
ing charette week, Charles Sorber of 
23 Mawhinney street, found time for 
a fishing trip. He tells us that the 
vacuum fish, to use his own words, 
are very plentiful at his secret fishing 
resort.
Mr. Mooreheads calculus class has 
chosen G. G. Grenlich as specialist 
on sine curves.

has also been described in a previous 
issue. The remainder of the Science 
School has to be completed, that is, 
the portion between the present build
ing and Machinery Hall, with which 
it will connect.
The Industry group is about com
pleted, except the joining building be
tween the present buildings and the 
new Central Building. The Design 
Building is nearing final completion. 
It has only one direction for future 
extension and that is the Friday prop
erty in the rear. Here there is pro
jected a group of studios placed 
around a recital garden. This is a 
similar arrangement to an Arts and 
Crafts settlement. Each studio would 
be complete in itself and all joined to
gether by a cloister or arcade con
necting with the present building.
The Margaret Morrison Building 
will have the rear wing built with 
future development on the old athletic 
field. This field will be filled in, with 
dirt from the McGinley extension, of 
which about fifty feet will be removed 
from the topto the level of the new 
field. This ground will provide the 
place for a faculty home, dormitory 
and gymnasium group with a garden 
in the center.
The dormitories for the boys which 
two buildings have been completed, 
will have another building placed in 
the rear. The United States Bureau 
of Mines, which is building now, will 
connect with the schools. An ex
perimental stadium will be placed in 
the ravine below the Morewood 
bridge in the rear of the present Sci
ence School. Below it will be the 
power house of the Bureau. Future 
extension for the Bureau of Mines 
will be on Forbes street to our prop
erty.
The last, but not to say the least, 
will be an enormous auditorium seat
ing approximately 3,000 to 4,000, will 
be built on the tennis courts to the 
right of the Design School. The fea
ture of this building will be the double 
stage. On one side,the side towards 
the parkwill be an open-air theatre, 
while on the other a magnificent au
ditorium of large proportions. We 
lack a large auditorium on the cam
pus and this would about meet our 
needs.
The above prospectus has been 
made possible by the acquirement of 
the new property, which has changed 
the original scheme considerable. This 
plan may be changed in detail but 
the general outline will be held to. 
At the completion of the group it 
will be second to none. The Tartan 
shall print from time to time the 
changes in the planning and additions 
to take place. The work that is being 
started in the near future is the Woods

CARNEGIE MECH. ENG. 
SOCIETY.
On Wednesday evening, January 
12, the members of the Carnegie Me
chanical Engineering Society will 
have the pleasure of hearing Mr. J. C. 
Hobbs, of the class of 1910, in Some 
Things the Average Young Engineer 
Runs Into After Leaving College. 
Mr. Hobbs is president of the Duquesne Light Company Section of the 
National Electric Light Association 
and is also teaching Stationary Engi
neering at night in Machinery Hall.
Prof. Trinks refers to Mr. Hobbs 
as one of the brightest men ever grad
uated from Carnegie Tech and this 
in itself testifies to the treat in store 
for us. During his experience, Mr. 
Hobbs has observed many things 
which the average student never 
learns until he leaves college, and 
these are some of the things he will 
speak about.
The C. M. E. S. picture for the 
Thistle will be taken tonight at the 
meeting, and all members are par
ticularly urged to be present at 8:15 
as the camera man will be ready at 
8:30 P. M. As usual, the meeting will 
be held in the Science Club Room.
ALAN S. YOUNG ADDRESSES 
MHO CLUB.
The student Branch of the A. I. E. 
E. was treated to a very interesting 
talk by Mr. Alan S. Young, of the 
Leeds &vNorthrup Co., on measur
ing devices. Owing to the awarding 
of the letters to football men being 
held on Wednesday night, Mr. Young
Half the style of a tailored suit is 
lost, unless the suit is kept perfectly clean and ircely pressed. We have 
cleaned and pressed so many ladies 
tailored suits that we have becom^ ex
perts at it. and return your garments 
so nicely finished as to elicit praise 
from even the most critical. Send 
your suit to us frequently. J. E. T. 
Shuman, 3911 Forbes St. Adv.
gave the talk in the afternoon at 2:30 
P. M.
The talk, which consisted of a trip 
through the Leeds and Northrup 
plant by means of lantern slides, was 
highly interesting and instructive. 
The way many of the common meas
uring devices used in our laborator
ies, are made was described comple
tely.
After the address, Mr. Young ans
wered numerous questions, which 
had arisen. A very large attendance 
was recorded, many of the Industries 
students being present.
ALUMNI RINGS.
The members of the Senior Elec
trical class are now hard at work on 
the competition problem. Most of the 
premilinary work has been accom
plished and the real part of the prob
lem has been started. While not much 
can be said at this early stage of the 
game, the work seems to be progress
ing very well and the class is optim
istic over the prospects of winning 
all there is to be won.
The absence of Mac Stevenson, 
the rough neck Electrical, was 
keenly felt by the members of that 
august body. Mac was attacked 
by the enemy and has been sick for 
a week. However, he will probably 
return this week and all will be well 
again.
Steps Are Taken By Science Seniors 
Toward Securing a Standard Ring.
At a recent meeting of the Senior 
class the subject of a class ring was 
taken up and cussed and discussed at 
some length. Following a suggestion 
offered at General Lecture on Alumni 
Day a few weeks ago, it was decided 
that an attempt should be made to 
do away with the individual class 
ring, if possible, and adopt one which 
is acceptable to all classes. If this is 
possible all future Tech graduates will 
wear the same ring.
In order to accomplish this a rep
resentative is to be chosen by each 
of the four classes of the Science and 
Design Schools to act on a committee 
with a member, chosen by the Alumni 
Association, who will act as chairman 
of the committee. It will be the duty 
of the committee to make a choice of 
a ring and offer it to each class. The 
ring must then be voted on by each 
class and accepted unanimously by all 
of the classes before it becomes the 
standard Alumni Ring.
The Senior class voted, however, 
that unless the ring is chosen before 
February 15th, that they shall proceed 
and choose a ring for their own class.
There is no doubt but that this is 
a good movement, and is one which 
should be pushed by the whole school.
NIGHT SCIENCE MEETING

tertaining than, does our own. The 
old thorn that the Night School is 
given too little space, is being grad
ually removed, and this year unlimited 
space is promised the Night Students. 
Pictures especially, taken during va
cation or at work, will be acceptable. 
Undoubtedly, this years copy of the 
Thistle will be more interesting and 
a more valuable reminder to the 
Night men than any previous issue.
Mr. Wright concluded by asking for 
a show of hands from those who 
would be unwilling to buy a This
tle, and there was no response. 
Those who intend fulfilling their 
promise should see to it that their 
orders are handed in as soon as pos
sible.

in the evening.
The festivities occupied the whole 
third floor which was decorated most 
appropriately with many evergreen 
trees. The long corridor was lined 
on both sides with them, while part 
of the Recreation Hall was so sepa
rated from the rest of the room to 
form a stage setting for the play giv
en there later in the evening.
The class rooms opening on the cor
ridor were used by the different de
partments as booths in which to dis
play the articles they had for sale. 
The Home Arts & Crafts Depart
ment occupied the room at the head 
of the stairs. Here one could pur
chase hand-painted Christmas 
cards, favors, jewelry, block 
printed scarfs, bags and table 
covers. All the articles for sale were 
made by the girls in the Department 
and represent many hours of hand 
work.
The next room was occupied by the 
Costume Economics Department. In 
this booth, all kinds of hand-sewn 
gifts were for sale. Childrens dress
es, fancy towels, pin-cushions, em
broidered and crocheted linens were 
found. There were arranged very at
tractively and found many willing 
buyers.
In Kitchen C, the Household Econ
omics Department held full sway. 
Here one could find all kinds of good 
things to eat. Christmas cookies and 
cakes, elaborate and fancy candies, 
attractively arranged, were displayed. 
Everything was home-made and 
looked good enough to eat, which is 
the highest praise that could be given.
The regular program of festivities 
began about nine oclock. A proces
sion formed in the lower halls, con
sisting of the girls of the Choral Club 
and the far-famed Boars Head Pro
cession following. They sang Christ
mas carols as they made their way 
through the building to the Recreation 
Hall, and the effect was very pretty 
as the sound came nearer and nearer. 
The play immediately followed, given 
by the Dramatic Club. It was just a 
short miracle play written by Lady 
Gregory entitled The Traveler, 
which was very appropriate, having 
running through it the Christmas 
spirit of peace on earth, good will 
to men.
The girls taking part were: Miss 
Helen Senn, as the traveler; Miss Con
stance Stout, as the mother, and Miss 
Jean Barr, as the child. All three 
girls deserve a great deal of credit 
for the excellent way in which they 
interpreted the thought of the play.
After the play, several folk dances 
were given by the Plebes and Sopho
mores, representing the Athletic As
sociation. The regular entertainment 
program closed with a few general 
folk dances in which many of the au
dience joined.
The far side of the hall was very 
attractively screened and decorated to 
resemble an old inn. Small tables 
wrere placed there and costumed wai
tresses added greatly to the attrac
tiveness of the scene. Here one might 
purchase small plum puddings, indi
vidual mince pies, ice cream and cof
fee. All the refreshments were made 
by the girls and as a natural result dis
appeared more rapidly than bought 
ones could possibly have done.
It will be almost impossible to give 
due credit to everyone who deserves 
mention by name, because of the work 
done by them for this entertainment. 
It was carried through by practically 
the whole school, much more so than 
anything ever given before. Of course, 
there were a few that shirked, there 
always are, but we will ignore them 
and turn to the far greater number 
who worked, and worked hard. Of 
the faculty perhaps Miss Demarest 
and Miss Hopkins deserve special 
mention; the former, for all the time 
and thought put upon it, and the lat
ter for first suggesting the general 
idea to the Guild. Of the students, 
Miss Sanford, general chairman, made 
splendid use of her time by clever 
organization and excellent suggestions 
and ideas. From the Senior class, 
Miss Pichel, Miss Ride, Miss Searight, 
Miss Irwin, Miss Sharpe, Miss Pon
tius and Miss McClelland, spent many 
hours outside of school planning and 
preparing good things to sell. From 
the Junior class, Miss Woodruff, and 
the other girls of the Home Arts & 
Crafts Department, Miss Smith, Miss 
Pryne, and Miss Worth, all should 
have their share of the credit.
Of all the departments, the Home 
Arts & Crafts should get special 
praise for the amount of time and 
energy spent upon making articles for 
their booth. Taking everything to
gether it was a wonderful success and 
we, Seniors, who will not be back next 
year, hope the girls will take enough 
interest to repeat it, only on a larger 
and more splendid scale.
DR. LEVY ADDRESSES 
STUDENTS OF SCIENCE. 
Famous Educator and Preacher Talks 
on Pan-Americanism.
Dr. Levy, Rabbi of the Rodef Sha
lom Congregation on Fifth avenue, 
near Morewood, spoke to the students 
of the School of Applied Science in 
Room 209, Science, on last Wednes
day morning at 10:30. The dean has 
for some years been trying to arrange 
to have Dr. Levy speak to the stu
dents but he was successful for the 
first time last Wednesday. Dr. Levys 
time is so fully taken up that he ar
ranged with difficulty to come.
Throughout the talk, the broad
mindedness of the speaker was evi
dent, and it was not hard to see why 
he has a national reputation as a 
pleasing and forceful speaker. As 
vice president of the national peace 
organization his talk dealt somewhat 
with the war, and the Wilson plan, 
but though Dr. Levy apparently was 
not in sympathy with preparedness, 
he did not utter one word in criticism 
of the President.
At first the speaker developed at 
some length the difference between 
man and the lower animals, consider
ing man a square creature with four 
sides, physical, mental, moral, and 
spiritual. The last of these, the spir
itual, was the only radical difference 
between man and animals.
The speaker said in part: I be
lieve in fighting, I believe that man
was made to fight; but I think it is 
infinitely greater to slay parasites 
than Parisians, I think it is better by 
far to fight germs than to fight Ger
mans. . . . The American Na
tion has gone through a remarkable 
time. Just as the Hebrew People were 
set aside to give to the world a reve
lation of holiness, just as the Grecian 
nation was set aside to give a revela
tion of beauty, just as Rome to give 
a revelation of government, I feel 
that by the Providence of God the 
United States is set aside for a special 
purpose.

THAT RAILWAY MAIL JOB.
During the week before Christmas, 
over a hundred Tech men helped 
Uncle Sam in his Railway Mail serv
ice here in Pittsburgh, to say nothing 
about those who helped in the citys 
local service at the different Post 
Offices about town. These hundred 
were all concentrated at the Pitts
burgh Terminal Post Office down near 
the Pennsylvania Station, with a few 
at the different other Railway stations 
about town.
The way the} got this work was 
this: The Railway Mail Office called 
up our employment bureau and told 
them they wanted a hundred men to 
help during the Christmas rush. No
tices went up on the bulletin boards 
and in a few days about 125 men or 
more had gone down, and been put 
through a lengthy catechism by the 
clerk at the Liberty Avenue Terminal 
and his record filed for later picking 
the men. Then during the last week 
or two of school before the holidays 
notices to go down town and swear 
allegiance to the Constitution were 
received, and on the Saturday after 
vacation began, everbody went to the 
office and was bonded for a few thou
sand dollars or so, and got his instruc
tions as to when and where he was 
to work.
others for as low as four. Everybody 
worked an eight hour shift, but the 
time of getting started and of finish
ing up reduced the actual time worked 
per shift to nearer seven hours. Three 
working periods or tours made up the 
day: Tour No. 1, 11:00 P. M.-7:30 A. 
M.; Tour No. 2, 7:00 A. M.-3:30 P. M.; 
and Tour No. 3, 3:00 P. M.-ll:30 P. M. 
Those men who expected to be given 
runs on trains were disappointed, for 
everybody stayed right in Pittsburgh. 
Some, known as Transfer Clerks, 
worked in the stations and sorted the 
sacks just as they arrived on the 
trains, separating the mail into that 
which went out on other trains at 
once, that which went to the local 
post offices, and that which went over 
to the Terminal Post Office to be 
sorted further, or worked as the 
mail clerks call it. Then others, and 
these were the majority of the extra 
men, worked over in the terminal, 
handling the enormously swelled par
cel post traffic. Some threw the bags 
from the wagons down a shute into 
the cellar where another force seized 
them, sorted them on piles and trucks 
to be sent upstairs to the proper 
floors. The enormous amount of mail 
handled may be appreciated if one 
considers that in one eight hour per
iod enough mail would come into the 
cellar to fill that room to the ceil
ings with one three-foot aisle down 
the center, and the room was at least 
thirty feet by one hundred on the 
floor and ten feet high. And all this 
time they were sorting the parcels 
as fast as possible on the upper floors. 
The work upstairs consisted chiefly 
of dumping bags full of parcels on the 
sorting table, giving what little help 
you could in sorting it, and then in 
tying out the filled bags, removing 
them from the pouch racks and plac
ing them on trucks to be sent out. It 
was real work, for the sacks were 
anything but light. The dust caused 
by the handling of dusty bags was 
hard on throats of those, not used 
to it, and there were very few who 
didnt have a bad cold as the result 
of the conditions they worked under. 
The fact that the men worked is evi
dent when no one wanted to do any 
overtime.
Practically all of the work was over 
by either Christmas Eve or the next 
morning, so that a great many got 
home for Christmas. The pay has 
not yet been received, but the end of 
this week will see everyone who 
worked down there richer by $2.42 a 
day.
