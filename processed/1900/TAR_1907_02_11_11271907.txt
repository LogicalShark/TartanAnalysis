Mr. Wm. P. Fields,
Secy Carnegie Technical Schools,
. City:
Dear Sir: Permit me to thank you
for the opportunity to attend your 
foot-ball game on Thanksgiving Day.
I very heartily approve of your posi
tion in intercollegiate sports. I be
lieve if all college games could be 
kept on a non-mercenary basis much 
of the evil that has crept into such 
sports would be eliminated.
Very truly yours,

LEHIGH SQUAD ARRIVES.
The Lehigh University Foot-ball 
squad, consisting of twenty men, ar
rived at the Pennsylvania station at 
7.33 this morning, and are being cared 
for at the Hotel Schenley. President 
Drinker and several members of the 
Lehigh Faculty, who accompanied the 
squad, will probably be entertained 
by Dr. Hamerschlag. Provision has 
been made for a special car to con
vey the men to Homestead, where they 
will visit the steel works this morn
ing, after which they will return to 
the Hotel for luncheon, and in the 
afternoon will run through secret sig
nal practice at Friendship Park. This 
evening both the Lehigh and Tech 
teams will be the guests of the Le
high Alumni at the University Club,
where a purity dinner will be serv
ed. Thursday morning the visiting 
squad will be escorted through the 
institution and schools, after which 
they will return to the hotel for lunch
eon, and then prepare for the game, 
which will be called at 2.30 P. M.
At G oclock P. M. Thursday, a 
Thanksgiving dinner will be served 
to both teams at the Schenley Hotel. 
In the evening the teams will attend 
the Grand Theater. The visitors leave 
at 11.10 P. M.
As an evidence of the spirit evinced 
by well-known business men of the 
city in the Thanksgiving Day game, 
print herewith copies of a few letters 
received in reply to invitations sent 
out:
Nov. 22, 1907. 
William P. Field, Esq.,
Care Carnegie Technical Schools, 
City:
My Dear Mr. Field: I thank you
kindly for the two tickets for the 
foot-ball game Thanksgiving Day. I 
regret indeed that I will be leaving 
the city on Monday next and will be 
gone for a week or 10 days, and am 
therefore unable to take advantage 
of your kind invitation.
I return the tickets to you inas
much as you will doubtless have no 
trouble disposing of them to advan
tage.
Hoping the occasion may be a great 
success and that the Tech may win 
hands down, believe me,
Yours very truly,
D. L. Gillespie.

A Tall Reinforced Concrete Light
house.
A very tall lighthouse has recently 
been constructed with great rapidity 
on the Point De La Coubre, at the 
mouth of the Gironde River, France, 
where sudden erosion by the sea 
threatened the existing lighthouse. 
The new one, about 225 feet high over 
all, was accordingly built a little far
ther inshore at a total cost of about 
$90,000, and put in service within 
nine months from the date of com 
mencement. The new structure is a 
tapered cylinder of reinforced con
crete 35 feet in diameter at the base 
and 192 feet in height from the base 
to the focal plane. It has two lan
terns, one at the top and another 11S 
feet above the base, and has no in
terior openings except the circular 
stair well 11% feet in diameter, and 
the service room. An external annu
lar gallery below the lantern is sup
ported on radial concrete brackets. 
The circular main walls of the shaft 
are about 21A feet thick at the top 
and are battered uniformly 2.6 per 
cent, to a thickness of 5 ft. 10 in. at 47 
feet above the base, where the batter 
increases to 35 feet at the footing, 
which is 11% feet deep and 52% feet 
in diameter. This reduces the maxi
mum pressure to 3 tons per square 
foot on the sand, 7% feet above high 
water.
The lantern room floor is carried 
on steel beams and the walls of the 
shaft are reinforced near the outer
face, by vertical and horizontal bars 
0.4 in. in diameter and 8 in. apart on 
centers embedded in 6 in. of. rich con
crete surrounded by concrete made 
about 1 part cement to 6 parts of 
mixed sand and gravel. The tower 
was proportioned for a dead load of 
149 pounds per cubic foot of concrete, 
and for a wind pressure of 56 pounds 
per square foot of vertical surface. 
The maximum compression on the 
concrete is about 8.7 tons per square 
foot.
The machine-mixed concrete was 
delivered by an endless-rope incline 
to the foot of the tower and hoisted 
in steel buckets handled by a mast 
and boom derrick in the center of the 
erection platform. The platform was 
carried by six radial horizontal lattice 
girders 35% feet long supported on 
the steel inner forms for the shaft. 
It had a light conical roof with an 
angle iron frame-work and from it 
was suspended an annular outside 
scaffold and a circular interior scaf
fold below the bottom of the inside 
form. The inside form was made of 
four courses of steel shutters with 
interior flanges and the exterior form 
was made with six courses of wooden 
shutters 26 in. high and 1% ian. thick, 
with their upper and lower edges rab
beted to overlap and tightly bound to
gether by %-in. horizontal wire ropes 
with turnbuckle adjustments. As 
fast as the concrete walls were built 
up close to the under side of the plat
form, jack screws were set on them 
and lifted the platform high enough 
to release the interior steel shutters 
and allow the lower course to be re
moved and placed on top of the upper 
course, after which the platform was 
lowered to bearing on it again and 
the lower course of external shutters 
was also raised and set on top of the 
upper one, and so on until the work 
was completed. The shutters were 
removed after the concrete was three 
days old. The tower settled about 
0.4 in., and during a heavy gale a few 
months after its completion the oscil
lations recorded by an automatic in
strument did not exceed 0.08 ip,, and 
had a minimum period of 0.71 sec
onds. The design and construction 
were described in a recent issue of 
The Engineer, of London.Engi
neering Record.

The Dramatic Club has had its first 
meeting and has decided to meet Fri
day afternoon at 3.15 oclock. The 
members are all asked to attend the 
next meeting.
Miss Ada Ramlack read in last 
weeks Tartan, in the column Perti
nent and Impertinent, a notice to 
the effect that she had announced her 
engagement. As such an announce
ment has never been made the notice 
can scarcely be classed as pertinent. 
We leave it to the reader to give it 
its proper place. Miss Ramlack grate
fully acknowledges the congratula
tions offered by the staff, and, should 
they ever be pertinent, will gladly ac
cept them. They are not needed as 
yet.
A Recent Wedding.
The marriage of Miss Allegheny to 
Mr. Pittsburgh was solemnized this 
week bv the Rev. U. S. Supreme 
Court. Father Penn bestowed his 
heartiest congratulations and blessing 
on the young bride and groom. They 
will make their home in Greater Pitts
burgh, and the groom is sparing 
neither labor nor expense in procur
ing gifts, useful and ornamental, to 
contribute to the wifes happiness. 
Among them are, a portion of a large 
filtration plant, that she may have 
purer water to drink; a law establish
ing a single street car fare, that she 
may visit the North Side without 
having two fares to pay; and, last but 
not least, he is planning a beautiful 
new City Hall, where, he and his bride 
will work hand in hand. The bride 
will not be the only to benefit by this 
union, for at the banquet given by the 
groom to be, to his bachelor friends, 
he decided to remove the bridge 
taxes, and the all-night rates on the 
street cars. The friends of the young 
couple are delighted that they are 
wedded at last, after such a long 
courtship.

THE TARTAN7
8 NINETEEN TEN X
J. H. Taxis, Editor.
The Schedule Committee met Di
rector Hamerschlag and Mr. Leete 
on Thursday evening and informed 
them of the strain under which the
1910 class has been working. The 
amount of work outside of regular 
preparation in the shape of problems 
and Lab. notes requires from 8 to 10 
hours a week and in some sections as 
high as 22 hours per week. Consider
ing an attendance of four nights per 
week at school there remains very lit
tle time for recreation after complet
ing the work assigned to do at home. 
The Director and Registrar were 
amazed at these conditions and in 
formed the committee that st6ps 
would be taken immediately to have 
the total time required for outside 
work cut down to at least eight hours 
per week. Monthly tests would only 
consume one-half of the period instead 
of the entire period. The four nights 
schedule will continue for the balance 
of the term at least and possibly will 
be cut to three nights after the first 
of the year. The Director told of the 
remarkable progress made by class
1910 so far this year, and expressed 
his satisfaction a meetin gof the class 
was called on Friday night and the ac
tion of the committee and its report 
was approved.
The slump in business has resulted 
in the loss of positions by a large 
number of the class, but as the old 
saying goes, It is an ill wind that 
blows nobody some good, will fit in 
nicely at this time. The boys will 
have more opportunity for study, and 
this will keep up the high standard 
of scholarship the boys have estab
lished as to efficiency in all branches 
and when business again picks up 
they will all have stronger founda
tions.
The rehearsals of the Mandolin 
Club will continue every Sunday af
ternoon at 2.45 oclock. There are 
still ome places open, and any stu
dent playing either guitar or mandolin 
is invited to come out and try for 
them. Manager Frank is arranging
several trips in the vicinity of Pitts
burg, trips that can be taken without 
interfering with business, so a good 
time is in prospect for both musical 
clubs.
Reed, the bright secretary of the 
class, must spend all his time at 
school. No matter how early one 
comes or how late one stays, Reed 
is found at his table plugging away. 
Probably he has no home! President 
Smith should investigate and find out 
the reasons.
That was a clever trick that was 
played by some one on the sections 
which have Physic Lab. practice on 
Thursday nights, in putting ice water 
on the chairs. Several of the boys 
were caught and numerous remarks 
were made as to what would be done 
to the joker if he were known.
Class 1911 proposes to attend the 
game on Thanksgiving Day in mas
querade costumes. Dont be ashamed 
of your appearance, 1911, you cant 
help it. Come out the way you are 
and no masquerade will be needed.

Poetless.
The coatless man puts a careless arm 
Round the waist of a hatless girl, 
While over the dustless, mudless roads 
In a horseless wagon they whirl. 
Like a headless bullet from hammerless gun,
By smokeless powder driven.
They fly to taste the speechless joys 
By endless union given,
The only luncheon his coinless purse 
Affords to them the means 
Is a tasteless meal of boneless cod, 
With a dish of strngless beans.
He smokes his old tobaccoless pipe, 
And laughs a mirthless laugh,
When papa tries to coax her back 
By wireless telegraph.Ex.

Senior Class Meeting.
On Thursday during the noon hour 
the Seniors held a class meeting in 
the Chemical Lecture Room. The 
meeting was called to order by Mr. 
Schumacher, the Vice President, In 
the absence of Mr. Henderson. The 
purpose of the meeting was to hear 
and to discuss the report of the com
mittee on the transferring of the 
Thistle to the Junior class. Some dis
cussion was held as to whether the 
two Plebes elected to the board 
should be members of the succeeding 
board, and as to whether the book 
should be purely an Applied Science 
organ. It was decided to allow the 
other departments to contribute as 
much as they wished, and the clause 
restricting the two Junior members to 
former Plebe members was stricken 
out.

Football in 1583.
The gentle game of football is 
described thus in a work entitled 
Anatomie of Abuses, published in 
1583.. For I protest unto you it may 
rather be called a friendly kind of 
fight than a play of recreation, a 
bloody and murthering practice than a
sport of pastime for dooth not every 
one lye in waight for his adversaries, 
seeking to overthrow him and to picke 
him on his nose, though it be on hard 
stones, so that by this means some
times their backs, sometimes their 
legs, sometimes their armes, some
times one part thrust out of joynt, 
sometimes another; sometimes the 
noses gush out blood; sometimes their 
eyes start out.-------o-------
Michigan May Add Weeks to Year.
The .Senate of the University of 
Michigan has declared itself in favor 
of adding one more week to the length 
of the university year. According to 
this plan, it will now have thirty-six 
weeks of school instead of thirty-five.
The Senate thinks that the Thanks
giving and Christmas holidays have 
been given undeserved importance. A 
break of seventeen days for Christmas 
just before the first semester exams 
will, it ;is feared, result in a heavy 
crop of flunks.
Henceforth the Christmas vacation 
at Michigan will be limited to eight 
days.
-------o---------
Plebe Banquet.
Despite the fact that their president 
had been stolen, the Plebe class held 
their first banquet at the Schenley 
Hotel last Tuesday night. A hun
dred and twenty-four Plebes were 
present and were presided over by the 
vice president, Mr. Mead. One Junior 
was present and was royally enter
tained. The program following the 
banquet was as follows: Mr. H. T. Ash 
spoke on School Spirit and said in 
part: School spirit is standing by 
each other, whether as a section, class 
or school. Mr. C. F. Borschneck 
spoke on Eggs in which he humor
ously alluded to eggs, ending with a 
serious talk on the value of character. 
Mr. Allen Bright spoke on Athletics. 
Next Mr. Nichols, gave an excellent 
imitation of Doctor Jekyl and Mr. 
Hyde in the transformation scene. He 
certainly rivalled Mr. Shea, consider
ing the settings he had at hand. A 
selection on the piano and violin by 
Messrs. Cassidy and Meyer followed 
Mr. Nichols address, from which it 
appears, there is musical talent in 
the class. Mr. A. Hume spoke on
Comradeship* in which he brought 
forth the fact that this was the im 
portant factor of fellows either in 
school or business life. Mr. Huroki 
spoke on the relations of Japan and 
the United States, saying there could 
never be any serious trouble between 
these countries for the U. S. A. gave 
Japan their civilization, and that they 
hoped to show their appreciation of it 
in the near future. The quartette 
favored the class with two well 
rendered selections, Kentucky Babe 
and Good Night. Mr. L. W. Mc
Intyre spoke on Engineers and En
gineering, in which he showed that 
it takes thorough engineers to sur
mount any and all difficulties and the 
class showed an excellent beginning 
on their engineering career by so 
easily stepping over the little dif
ficulty of the lost president. The 
Junior, Mr. Lebselter, acknowledged 
very gracefully that the Plebe class 
was all right as it was and that it 
would be a cracker jack if properly 
organized.
The happy gathering then adjourn

Dr. Hamerschlag delivered a laysermon at Dr. Whartons church on 
Sunday night last, at which a large 
number of Tech men were present. 
Dr. Hamerschlag took for his subject, 
Problems of the City Life, which he 
developed into an intensely interest
ing and instructive discourse. He 
cited reasons of the exodus from 
country to city. Why people prefer 
to assume the burdens of a maddening 
city existence to the more quiet and 
beautiful life in the country. He main
tained that this change from country 
to city was not worth while unless the 
motives of the citys citizens tended 
toward the city beautiful and civicrighteousness.

Penn State College has purchased 
197 acres of land known as the Edmiston farm adjoining the northern side 
of the present property. This will

Owing to the fact that the Day In
dustrials had two men arranging 
games for them for last Saturday Af
ternoon, they had two teams out to 
oppose them. The 1911 class team 
was not in uniform, thinking they had 
the game, as indeed they had, but as 
the arrangements were made by some 
other than the regular manager, they 
were compelled to give place to the 
Pittsburg Academy team. As it was, 
however, the night students got in 
about two and one-half hours of sig
nal and tackling practice. The prac
tice was not as peppery as the coaches 
would have liked, but the bitter dis
appointment at not getting at 
somebody took some of the spirit and 
dash out of them. They are perhaps 
the better for not having had a battle, 
as they are in good shape now for the 
big game Thursday morning, when 
they line-up against 1912.

Thanksgiving moining, the work of 
the rival fullbacks will no doubt be 
watched with great interest. Both 
the men are captains of their respec
tive teams, and they will not only be 
opposed as individuals but also as 
field generals. A Comparison of the 
two men shows an advantage in favor 
of 12 in height and weight, but in 
! punting and speed the wise ones con
cede the advantage to 11. However, 
Hhe differences are not marked and the 
|two Macs ought to put up a pretty 
game of ball. The rival captains are 
McGovern, of 12, and McNulty, of 11.
If Glasser, the green guard of 1911, 
Splays football with the same energy 
he displays in class fights, he will be 
troublesome to the opposition.
Hess, the veteran guard of 1911, is 
a versatile, violent and vicious player. 
As a linesman he changes recklessly, 
but he shines as fullback.
Many inquiries are being made re
garding the 1911 quartette. From the 
strains of melody (it being usually 
strained to the joyful limit) which 
reach the ears of unfortunate auditors, 
one must in justice to the singers say 
that it would not be "feo bad if they 
did not have such poor (rotten) voices. 
The gentleman who rumbles bass 
may be said to be the star performer, 
but as they all take turns singing the 
pedal notes it might be well to style 
the organization the All-Star Quar
tette.
The officers of 1911 wish to be put 
on record as being against the prac
tice of publishing their affairs in the 
daily papers. They disclaim any 
knowledge of the source of informa
tion leading to the article which ap
peared in a recent issue of the Pitts
burg Leader and the person or per
sons responsible for the appearance of 
said article will be severely taken to 
task if discovered. The notoriety and 
the possible reflection upon the good 
name of our school are very distate
ful to any loyal student of Tech, and
the officers of 11 are certainly of 0 8L

sent them before the faculty and in 
general intercollegiate affairs, and all 
attempts at class boards with sec

failure. A board without a constitu
tion has proved weak and inefficient, 
being unable to help the students 
authoritatively in any important meas

undergraduate viewpoint, but the lack 
of a regular representative body has 
been felt strongly. The. instrument

The Study of Metals.
If one stops to consider the number 
of known metals, even the number of 
those which are rather widely dis
tributed, it seems strange that some 
of them have not been more adequate
ly investigated. With the metallur
gical resources now at command it 
is feasible to get in a state of purity 
and in reasonable quantity many met
als which once ranked only as curios
ities. Some few of them have been 
worked up for special purposes with 
excellent results. For example, one 
may note the extraordinary qualities 
displayed by tantalum, investigated 
by Dr. von Bolton in the search for 
incandescent lamp material. If not 
used to the limit of supply for this 
purpose it may well serve as a sub
stitute for platinum and iridum in 
some of their important uses. One 
must also consider the use of vana
dium in steel, frequently heard of in 
automobile circles, and the little 
known use of uranium in steel worked 
up in the Krupp factory and kept very 
quiet. Tungsten is becoming a famil
iar word, and other of the rarer ele
ments are being heard from.
Finding direct uses for uncommon 
elements is, however, only a small 
part of the game. There are im
mense possibilities in alloys which 
are as yet untouched. Suppose, for 
instance, that one could find an alloy 
that would bear the same relation to 
aluminum that steel does to carbon 
or bronze to tin. The result would 
be a new structural material of im
mense importance in mercantile work. 
The builders of light machinery are 
looking for just this thing and with 
it the narrow gap that now exists be
tween failure and success in airships 
might readily be crossed. Possibly 
there may be in the list of waiting al
loys one of remarkable thermo-elec
tric properties which would be inval
uable for scientific work even if toe 
expensive for large commercial oper
ations. Equally useful in science 
would be a substance of good mechan 
ical properties having a very low co
efficient of expansion, to say nothing 
of one having the same coefficient as 
glass and making a good joint through 
it. The experience with tantalum 
shows very plainly that while some 
of the properties of rare elements 
may be accurately predicted by Mendeleeff's law, in the case of groups 
which are rather imperfectly known 
the data are uncertain and properties 
of a somewhat unexpected kind maiy 
be found. It is certainly worth while 
for the scientific forces to attack the 
rarer elements in a thorough and sys
tematic way and endowment of re
search to this end would be a good 
deed for humanity. Nobody can say 
definitely what will be the rare ele
ments of to-morrow,, for demand suf
ficient to call attention to the desira
bility of finding ores is more than 
likely to lead to discoveries. Some 
fine day even a mineral rich in radium 
is likely to turn up and break the price 
from dollars to cents a milligram. 
Perhaps some one may get enough 
ore to prepare the actual metal. It 
is time that the elements should be 
gone over with modern resources and 
their properties determined, for there 
are still many which are practically 
unknown quantities, especially with 
respect to their relations to others 
and to the arts.Engineering Record.

McGowan was elected captain of 
i912s football team. He is an experi

a lot of trouble. He shines in mak

gain when given the ball.
Captain McGowan of the 1912 
football team, is putting his sturdy 
bunch of warriors through some hard 
practicing. He expects to show 1911 
that 1912 is not to be fooled with 
when it comes to athletics.
Immediately after Thanksgiving 
1912 will try to organize a basketball 
team. We are pleased to announce 
that a challenge is offered to all, Night 
or Day, classes.
Mr. Tritschler has appointed repre

Schulman, a 1912 man, is now on

A little girl of four or five years 
was quietly playing on the porch one 
afternoon, while her father and one 
of his friends were enjoying a smoke 
and a chat on political matters. They 
paid no attention to the girl who was 
apparently busily engaged in playing 
with her dolls and teddy bears.
When the guest had gone and bed 
time came, she was unusually silent 
and thoughtful, and when she knelt to 
say her prayers there came a pause 
after the final petitions and she re
sumed very earnestly:
And now, God, please take great 
care of yourself, for if antyhing should 
happen to You, we should only have 
Mr. Roosevelt and he hasnt come un 
to papas expectations.
At a closing exercise of a Syracuse 
school a little girl was asked: Who 
is the head of our government?
Mr. Roosevelt, she answered 
promptly.
That is right.
But what is his official title?
Teddy, responded the miss 
promptly.

Modern Ideas in High Tension Line 
Work.
The Niagara-Toronto line is a cap
ital example of recent principles of 
line construction. Its performance 
should go far to settle some of the 
moot points of design. Of late there 
have been developed two distinct 
parties in high-voltage line work. 
One of these, which we may style the 
radical, pins its faith (with steel 
pins, of course) to the insulator alone, 
and the chief plank in its platform 
declares all wooden construction 
anathema. The other, or conserva
tive, holds that insulators are des
perately wicked and deceitful above 
all things, and that bringing the full 
earth potential squarely up into the 
interior of the insulator is simply in
citing it to crime. As happens in 
larger politics, either party can cite 
campaign documents without number, 
and yet when it comes down to busi
ness either can put up a safe and

successful administration. The line 
here under consideration is built on 
the tenets of the radical platform, 
yet we have no reason to indulge in 
any gloomy forebodings concerning 
its success, any more than if it had 
-been constructed on the most rigid 
Tory principles, albeit it is much 
easier to criticise a good line than to 
. build one.
The steel tower construction has 
many good points, especially in the 
reduction of the number of points at 
which the high-tension conductor has 
to be insulated. But it secures these 
advantages at the cost of absolute 
dependence on the insulators, which 
are fairly grounded in the interior all 
the time. Any failure of an insulator 
means putting the circuit out of busi
ness right then and there. In the Ni
agara-Toronto line there are two com
plete circuits carried on the towers, 
but how cheerful a task it will be to 
work on a tower with one circuit 
alive at GO,000 volts is not altogether 
obvious, even though the tower is 
grounded. However, in working at
60,000 volt in the present state of the 
art one is pretty consistently between 
the devil and the deep sea anyhow, 
and must take chances somewhere.
We are particularly glad to have 
a thoroughly first-class example of 
tower construction put up in a severe 
climate for work at 60,000 volts. It 
will go further toward trying out the 
merits of the system than a dozen 
such lines in Mexico or Southern Cal
ifornia. We note, too, that the line 
is a copper line in spite of the theo
retical advantages of aluminumper
haps a concession to climatic condi
tions, since as a rule aluminum can 
be had at a slight advantage in price. 
A temperature ranging from say 50 
degrees in winter to 125 degrees or 
so in the summer sun is quite a dif
ferent proportion from the compara
tive uniformity of many southern lo
calities, and the danger from snow, 
sleet and high winds is of course far 
greater in Canada than five hundred 
miles further south.
The precautions taken against 
lightning are most interesting and
look decidedly businesslike. Nobody 
knows exactly what lightning will do 
to a line carried on towers. In case 
of a wooden line it may splinter poles 
and even cross-arms without a shut
down. Whether it will go harmlessly 
down a tower without causing the 
line current to kick over the insu
lators remains to be seen. The broad 
principle of the protection, i. e., tak
ing relatively few precautions and 
those exceedingly thorough, is cer
tainly right. We should much like 
to see a veracious list of all the shut
downs which have been caused on 
high-voltage lines by failure of the 
lightning arrestors, not to arrest the 
lightning, but to hold the line insula
tion intact. It would be a long and 
variegated one. Certainly if a ground
ed wire strung above the line is to be 
anywhere effective it should be with 
such a construction as thisa sturdy 
stranded cable carried seven feet 
above the tower wires and thoroughly 
grounded. The arrangement of di
vision houses is exceedingly good, 
and should have been adopted on 
many lines that are without it. The 
convenience of being able to cut a 
section of one conductor without dis
turbing the others is at times most 
valuable and the value of such a 
house as a center of observation in 
caring for the line is very great. The 
lightning arresters, too, can thus be 
properly cared for and quickly re
paired in case of damage, which is 
quite impossible when they are scat
tered promiscuously along the line. 
We shall be greatly interested in 
watching the performance of this fine 
line when it is put to the test of con
tinuous service. It is in a situation 
where this test will be found of unu
sual severity in nearly every partic
ular, and success will mean the es
tablishment of some very valuable 
precedents. Electrical World.
