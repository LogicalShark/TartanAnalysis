FOOTBALL SCHEDULE FOR 16 IS DISCUSSE
Explanation of Next Seasons Pro
gram. Schedule Difficult 
to Arrange.
One of the most attractive sched
ules ever arranged for a Tech foot
ball team has been completed now 
for nearly a month. The schedule, 
as outlined in a recent edition of the 
Tartan, is as follows:
Sept. 30thYale University at New 
Haven, Conn.
Oct. 7thBethany College at Home. 
Oct. 14thGrove City College at 
Home.
Oct. 21stAllegheny College at 
Home.
Oct. 28thThiel College at Home. 
Nov. 4thCornell University at Ith
aca, N. Y.
Nov. 18thUniversity of Pittsburgh 
at Forbes Field.
It was deemed advisable this year 
only to play seven games on account 
of the exceptionally heavy schedule.
The entire schedule was practically 
determined by the offers of Cornell 
and Yale for games. The scheduling 
of those games together with the hard 
Pitt game made it absolutely neces
sary that the intermediate games, 
which are home games, be made of 
such a character that the team would 
be in good condition to make a satis
factory showing in the games that 
really count.
The opening game will be with Yale 
at New Haven. Yale offered two 
dates, the earlier of which was chosen, 
because of the certain conditions 
which will accrue to Techs advan
tage by playing such a large team so 
early in the season. The question of

JUNIOR PROM IS A PLEASANT MEMORY
Wonderful Music, Tasteful Decora
tions and Fair Ladies Combine 
to Make This Prom 
Best Ever.
If any member of the class of 1917, 
that is excluding those unfortunate 
individuals who were not present, and 
including also those fortunate ones 
of the class of 1916, were asked as 
to which of the many pleasant nights 
which have occurred during his life 
at Tech would linger longest among 
his other fond memories, without 
doubt, the answer would be, The 
Junior Prom of the class of 1917, at 
the Hotel Schenley on the night of 
Friday, February 11th, and the morn
ing of Saturday, February 12th, 1916.
For, while Junior Proms have come 
and gone during the past ten years, 
and a certain annual increment in the 
amount of pleasure that each attend
ant receives is to be expected, it seem
ed as though this year the committee 
had outdone themselves a little and 
that one left at breaking-up-time, far 
from tired, very much inspired and 
lifted into an exotic condition of hap
piness. It may have been the won
derful music with the lingering re
membrance of the strains of that emo
tional saxophone, it may have been 
the decorations, or the diaphanous 
impression left by the succession of 
lovely partners, that were the cause, 
but it was probably a combination 
of all.
At 9:30, after a few preliminary 
strains by the orchestra, A. J. Kerin, 
president of the Science class, 1917, 
led the grand march with his partner, 
Miss Helen McKenna, and other hunContinued on Page 4

First Open Meeting Most Successful.
The Carnegie Y. M. C. A. held their 
first open meeting last Sunday with 
a good crowd of fellows present, and 
the meeting was by far the liveliest 
and best of the year. Dr. Hugh T. 
Kerr, pastor of the Shadyside Pres
byterian Church, delivered an address 
which was most interesting and im
pressive. He dealt chiefly with temp
tations of life, telling how tempta
tions may be used to good or bad 
ends, how temptation hits the col
lege boy, probably hardest of all, and 
how a man, by merely being able to 
say No the first time temptation 
comes his way, instead of saying,

TECH NIGHT.
Elsewhere in the Tartan an account 
is given of the activities of the War 
Relief Committee and of the concen
tration of its efforts towards making 
the big relief entertainment, Thursday 
night, February 24th, a conspicuous 
success. It is scarcely necessary for 
us to back up the committee in every
thing that it is doing, not only in be
half of the war sufferers abroad, but 
also in behalf of a real Tech spirit. 
We are convinced that this enter
tainment is a very important step in 
the engenderment of a real college 
spirit, something which Tech in spite 
of its tender years is beginning to as
sume in all of its relations with the 
members of its own group and the 
people of the trusting world outside. 
The appeal to the heart that even a 
bare knowledge of the deplorable con
ditions in Europe and Asia causes, is 
enough to urge each student here to 
take in the benefit show. But there 
is something greater in this affair 
which should result in making it nec
essary for the management to hang 
up the standing room only sign in 
front of the theatre. That something 
is the get-to-gether spirit which is 
being manifested in all quarters, the 
spirit that will make the evening of 
the twenty-fourth resolve itself into 
a monster and inspiring family party. 
It will be a Tech night through and 
through and for that reason it is im
portant that all of the students, men 
and women, be there so that they may 
catch something of the spirit which
LETTER FROM THE DIRECTOR.
All business communications should be sent to the Business Manager.Any delay in delivery of this paper or change of address should be reported to the Business Manager at once.
Director Hamerschlag, in the fol
lowing letter, expresses his views on 
the present campaign for relief for 
the war sufferers abroad. His appeal 
for interest and participation on the 
part of students and faculty of this 
Institution supplements the letters 
from the deans, previously published.
To the Editor of the Tartan:
A letter just received from Profes
sor Day informs us of his promotion 
to the Lieutenant Colonelcy of the 
185th battalion of the Nova Scotia 
Highland Brigade. With this letter 
in my hand and with pride in his ad
vancement to a position of import
ance, I am oppressed with the dread 
that his active service in Europe plac
es his life in jeopardy. Many people 
must also be overwhelmed with the 
same thought where the relationship 
is more intimate, when they must face 
the knowledge that those they love 
have but small chance of returning to 
home and fireside. In those lands 
where the war has raged without ceas
ing for eighteen months, the non-com
batants must suffer; their unfortunate 
plight makes us stand aghast. Moth
ers, wives, and children, are driven 
from home and are helpless before 
the on-marching legions of soldiers 
who have trampled the fields, wrecked 
the cities, and devastated the country. 
Would that we as a neutral people 
could assuage that condition. We 
know that the reconstruction period 
is dependent upon many of these help
less people. Can we assist? We are 
perhaps the only nation which gets 
the true perspective of this catas
trophe which threatens to overwhelm 
and halt our modern civilization.
If you wish to express your sym
pathy do it in practical form by mak
ing a contribution to lighten the bur
den which has fallen upon these de
fenseless, homeless, war-ridden, griefstricken people. The War Relief 
Committee of faculty and students 
have attacked the problem in the right 
spirit by trying to make it an indi
vidual cause for everyone on the cam
pus. Small contributions are thank
fully received and our gratitude goes 
out to every giver. Would that we 
had a richer constituency so that the 
fund which we are now trying to 
raise would be greater in size and 
therefore broader in its service of al
leviation. Let us make our response 
to this appeal universal and gener
ous so that everyone may feel that 
he has taken a personal part in pro
viding this fund.
The benefit performance which is 
to be given at the Schenley Theatre 
should command a house packed to 
the doors with those who have pur
chased tickets. The most that we can 
do will be all too little. Once again 
let me ask you all to respond gener
ously.
ARTHUR A. HAMERSCHLAG, 
February 14, 1916.
The battle now raging comes as the 
direct result of the non-Christian lives 
followed by the peoples of the war
ring nations. It is primarily a con
flict of systems of governmentsnot 
of crowned heads; it is fundamentally 
a battle of peoples. A hundred Brit
ish cabinets may fall, yet the strife 
in defense of English rights goes on. 
A hundred Kaisers, Kings, or Emper
ors may be laid to dust, but their pass
ing means nothing for th~ interests of 
peace. Peace propagandas, such as 
the Ford Peace Party, will be directed 
with no visible resultat the base of 
all lies our Christian teaching un
heeded.
Two irreconcilable systems of gov
ernment have met in conflict and they 
must fight to the surrender or ex
termination of either party. Either 
the German military system will rule 
Europe or democracy and individual 
peace will be the ruler. There is no 
possible compromise. It will continue 
until either one side or the other ig 
defeated. Then, and only then, be
yond the shriek of strife and the toll 
of blood, will the welcome rainbow of 
enduring peace be seena long peace 
after a frightful war. G. A. C.
GIRLS.
Instigated By a Sunday Afternoon 
Call.
To a college man Girls are an 
enigma. He calls on them, dances 
with them, and worships them. But 
they always baflle him. He can never 
understand them.
This article is written with the 
intention of setting forth a few im
pressions which a student such as 
you or I may have gathered of the 
eternal feminine.
Girls are attractive or wet, The 
latter usually have brains. The at
tractive ones are cultivated by males. 
The other kind are popular only at 
their own parties. Girls are attractive 
for several reasons. Girls powder 
their faces and wear subtle clothing. 
They talk. They flirt outrageously 
with anyone who wears trousers, and 
are interested in all masculine pas
times. They adore a drinker.
Girls are wet because they arent 
attractive. They may be sympathetic, 
sincere, and unselfish, but they are 
wet. Older people call them 
good, but the college youth is se
vere. To him they are wet, and 
never can be otherwise. To escape 
the epithet a Girl must have money. 
Even then she is not sure. Wetness 
is like the ocean. It can never be 
drained.
College men are familiar with the 
eccentricities of the peaches only. 
The other class is shunned. It re
mains a sealed book. When Girls are 
mentioned hereafter the attractive 
kind is meant.
A fellow never ki.^ws when a Girl 
really likes him. As a rule the degrees 
of esteem varies directly with the 
amount of attention shown to her, 
and inversely with the consideration 
she shows to him. In other words 
the, man is always playing a losing 
game. If he plies her with candy,

theatres, and taxicabs, he doesnt 
know that the Girl is really fond of 
him. She thinks she' has him cinched. 
If he neglects her the Girl goes after 
him even though she doesnt care for 
him. The latter course is preferable. 
What boots it if the Girl doesnt care? 
He thinks she does. And thinking so 
doesnt cost him anything.
The pleasures of Girls are not many 
but intense. Men, bridge, dancing, 
clothes, and gossip represent feminine 
diversions. Other things are boring.

Grove City College Victor in Inter
esting Game.
Spectacular shooting and superior 
play by the Grove City five handed 
another disappointment to the loyal 
followers of the home squad to the 
tune of 34 to 22. The visitors were 
fast and shooting on every occasion 
and from any position caged suffi
cient to give them a firm hold on the 
leading end. The game was closely 
contested, however, and twice the 
home team crept within 4 points of 
the victors. The score at the end 
of the first half was 19 to 15, having 
been brought up from 19 to 9 by field 
goals by C. Meredith and Hines foulshooting. Capt. Hines was back for 
the whole game and displayed the 
qualities that make him a splendid all 
around player, but he is still a little 
under weight. The game was clean
throughout and comparatively few 
fouls were called on both sides.

Are Defeated 4 to 0 by Princeton 
AlumniCook Chosen Captain.
The fast team of Princeton Alumni 
had little trouble in vanquishing the 
Plaid seven 4 to 0, last Thursday 
night, in a game which was, if any
thing, loosely played by the Techites. 
The Tech squad had been put through 
too hard practice the night before and 
this may account for the bad showing. 
At any rate they were unable to re
sist Princetons speedy attack. Just 
before the game, Cook, a Junior in 
Design School, was chosen to captain 
the team. Cook comes from New 
Kensington, and has played much 
amateur hockey there. He certainly 
should be successful as captain.
The team will play Pitt Thursday 
night and a close game may be antici
pated as the records of both teams 
are much alike. An admission of 
thirty-five cents will be charged. This 
includes skating after the game is 
over.

left wing, Davis; right wing, McSorley; rover, Cook (captain); center,

TECH VS. PITT IN HOCKEY.
Thursday Night at Duquesne Garden.
Take a night off next Thursday, see 
Tech defeat Pitt in hockey, and skate 
with her until 10:30 P. M. A most 
pleasant way to spend an evening.
Techs chances of defeating Pitt are 
the best. Against the other teams of 
the league they were handicapped, as 
they are composed of players of years 
of experience in college hockey. But 
Pitt has a team of exactly our own 
calibre. An exciting game will result.
After the game the spectators have 
the privilege of skating for no fur
ther charge. Admission will be the 
regular price of 35 cents.
The Beta Theta Epsilon basketball 
team in the Fraternity league defeat
ed the Sigma Rho team on last Thurs
day evening by a score of 17-14. The 
game was exceedingly fast and excit
ing, and was marked by much clever 
playing. The teams were very close
ly matched, thus causing much team 
work with little basket shooting. The 
score at the end of the first half was 
10-6 in favor of Sigma Rho, the Beta 
Thetas coming back in the second half 
with a great burst of speed. Kesner

This time doesnt count, will never

mere companionship with others is 
often the strongest method of resist
ing temptation and benefits both par
ties. To illustrate, Dr. Kerr told of 
his experience with a man in Chicago 
and how merely by his presence he 
helped the man. This all goes to 
show the good that one can do for an
other by association at college.

dred odd couples followed. The honor 
guest was Norman McCloud, of the 
Prom Committee of the University of 
Pittsburgh, with his sister. Then fol
lowed sixteen dances in succession, to 
the music furnished by Nirellas Or
chestra of seven pieces. Mention 
must be made of that saxophone 
player, according to the leader, a 
product of Sousas Orchestra, and, as 
was evidenced, a wonderful musician.
Supper was served in the banquet 
hall and consisted of the usually tasty 
menu. At each place were half a 
dozen streamers and toy balloons, all 
of which were immediately in the air, 
wafting from table to table, so that 
the effects reminded one of a New 
Years eve in a cabaret. Punch was 
served among the booths during the 
evening. During the supper an Ha
waiian orchestra furnished the pecu
liar music of those islands.
The booths and decorations were 
a large factor in the pleasure of the 
evening. They were occupied by the 
fraternities. The non-fraternity men 
also had a booth, as did the night 
men this year. The decorations were 
in flags and banners, cut flowers, 
plants, and palms, which also massed 
the orchestra platform and the sides 
of the ball room. A large Carnegie 
banner hung at one end. Especial
mention must be made of the booth of 
the Beta Theta Epsilon fraternity 
which was a beautiful example of the 
decorators art as applied to lattice 
work, flowers and lanterns.
In the favors alone this year the 
committee attained an achievement. 
Soft tan leather bill folds with the 
school seal embossed with Junior 
Prom, 1917, were received by the men, 
while the ladies were presented with 
silver dorinnes with the school seal, 
embossed on the cover with the above 
engraving.
To Darwin Curtis, chairman of the 
committee, belongs the entire credit 
for the success of the evening, and the 
pleasure resulting to each couple. Mr. 
Curtis indefatigable energy and 
wealth of ideas have earned him the 
appreciation of all those present, and 
the gratitude of the other members 
of his class, that their numerals should 
be associated in future history with 
such a pleasant occasion. Mr. Cur
tis was largely assisted in the cul
mination of his plans by his able lieu
tenant, R. E. Orr. Other members of 
the committee were: R. B. Bogardus, 
Science; A. P. Brown, Science; H. E. 
Hellstrom, Science; J. R. Kilburn, De
sign; W. F. McMicheals, Night Sci
ence; W. McQuillan, Design; C. B. 
Schumacher, Science; W. R. Walker, 
Science; E. C. Wilson, Science.
Among those present were: Dean 
and Mrs. Leete, Dean and Mrs. Con
nelly, Dean Breed, Mr. and Mrs. McCorkle, Dr. Hamerschlag, Profs. 
Crabtree, Geogehan, and Holmes. M. 
Edwin Green and Edward A. Kemena, 
Presidents of the Sophomore classes 
of Design and Science, were also 
present.
FOOTBALL SCHEDULE FOR 16
Continued from Page 1 
accepting Yales offer was much dis
cussed before acceptance was made, 
but it was decided that Tech would 
benefit much from playing a team of 
Yales accepted standing and strength. 
Last year before the Pitt game, the 
team had not played a really hard 
game prior to that time, and, as the 
result showed, could not be expected 
to display even ordinary strength. 
Moreover, Yales offer to a team so 
distant as Tech, indicates that Techs 
good record last year and stand for 
clean athletics has attracted wide at
tention. Playing Yale the first game, 
means that the team will have to get 
down to hard work at an earlier date 
than heretofore.
Bethany College is to be played 
after the hard Yale game. Bethany 
was added to the schedule because it 
usually has a rather light team, which 
plays a clean game.
After Bethany, our old Grove City 
rivals are met. The game next fall 
should be much better than this last
years game, as scores indicate that 
the heavy Grove City team was some
what off color, and should be a good 
one from the spectators point of view, 
at the same time working the team 
up to the Allegheny game, which has 
always been a difficult game.
In order to bring the team around 
in good shape for the Cornell game, 
Thiel College is met on October 28th. 
Thiel plays a hard, clean game, and 
made a fine showing among the West
ern Pennsylvania teams last year. In 
this connection, several Pittsburgh pa
pers came out with that statement that 
Thiel College was playing the Pitt 
Freshmen next year. In answer to 
an inquiry by Manager Orr, Gradu
ate Manager Rissell of the Thiel team 
under date of February 1st, states the 
report is an error, and that Thiel had 
no idea of playing out of its class.
On November 4th, the team again 
takes a jaunt toward the Orient to 
meet Cornell at Ithaca, N. Y. It is 
pleasing indeed to note that football 
relations have been begun with Cor
nell. A satisfactory showing in this 
game will bring Tech recognition in 
a manner that it, perhaps, has not re
ceived before.
On November 11th the team is given 
an opportunity to rest up in prepara
tion for the Pitt contest, and give the 
men injured in the hard Cornell 
struggle time to come around into 
condition. A trip on this date was 
impossible, and on account of the 
Pitt-W. & J. game, a home game has 
not proved a success financially.
The Pitt game will undoubtedly 
prove the hardest game of the sea
son.
It was the intention of the Build
ing Bureau to complete the new field 
for the last game of the season, but 
from present indications this is an 
impossibility. Where the Tech team 
will play next season is yet to be defi
nitely determined; either the old field 
with temporary stands will be used, 
or an attempt will be made to have 
the new field partially completed.
No game will be played next year 
on the Saturday following the Pitt 
game. Great difficulty has been ex
perienced with this game in previous 
years for several reasons. In the first 
place, the climax of the season comes 
with the Pitt game, ind the playing of 
a team on the above date creates a 
detrimental anti-climax. The players 
find it hard to go after the last game 
with accustomed spirit. Secondly, bad 
weather has always been encountered. 
This makes playing particularly dan
gerous.
The schedule as a whole may be dis
appointing to a few on account of the 
small number of home games, but the 
selection of home games was entirely 
predetermined by the Yale and Cornell 
offers. Playing Yale, Cornell and 
Pitt made it necessary that the team 
meet only teams that would properly 
condition it for the games, in which 
the showing made, counts. Further
more, the uncertainty, as to where 
and under what conditions the home 
games will be played, limited the num
ber and quality of those games. The 
team has an exceptional chance to 
make a reputation next year, and it 
should be the duty of every man in 
school to further the chances of next

Master Spy. The part of Henri Durot, the adventurous French spy, is 
probably the best and most difficult 
part Mr. Steen has ever been asked 
to play and it is said by those who 
have witnessed the rehearsals that he 
asumes the part with every grace and 
naunce of expression at the command 
of an actor of versitile powers. Steen 
is being supported by the best mater
ial in the Drama School and the en
semble acting as well as the indi
vidual will in The Master Spy be 
quite up to standard. The play is in 
four acts. The prologue is set in 
Brooklyn, New York, and here the 
elements of the succeeding acts are 
exposed. The next The Two Lamps 
is somewhere in Alsace-Lorraine and 
the action takes place in the heart 
of the German lines. The third act 
concerns the actions of Durot in an 
Indian cantoment somewhere in 
France. The play is brought to a 
close by an epologue which clears 
up some of the mysteries that have 
gone before.
Between the acts of The Master 
Spy there are being arranged sev
eral items of entertainment, among 
them being the Margaret Morrison 
and Design School dancing arrange
ment, the musical clubs numbers, and 
some individual selections.
In addition to the printed posters 
already out, the Department of Paint

In a very exciting and exceedingly 
fast game the Sophomore Basketball 
team of the design school went down 
against the Plebe Architects team by 
a score of 21 to 13. The entire game 
was marked with much team work 
and little shooting. Miller and Werking starring for the Plebes, Brockmann and Spring for the Sophomores. 
This game was one of the final games 
of the Design school league, and gave 
the championship of the school to the 
Plebes.
DESIGN BASKET BALL NOTES.
In an interesting and hard-fought 
game, the Plebes won their final clash 
with the Sophs and, consequently, the 
championship of Design School. The 
game was featured by clean and fast 
playing, and the excellent team-work 
of the Plebes completely baffled the 
Sophs. Woodward and Molner did 
exceptionally good work for the 
Plebes.
The first year men now stand ready 
to play any class team in Tech. Ar
rangements can be made with R. E. 
Dake, Room 200, Design School.
BON VOYAGE.
It is with the most profound regret 
that we bid adieu to Howard B. 
Pierce. He leaves his work in the 
Design School to asume active voca
tion with the interior decorating de
partment of the Joseph Horne Com
pany, of this city. He leaves an act
ive and bright school future to as
sume a very tempting position. Al
though his time will be largely taken 
at his work he has become, as he says, 
so wedded to the Design School, and 
the paramount Tech spirit that he 
shall keep in close touch with our 
events and work.
As a man he has won our respect 
and affection. No task was too trivial, 
no work too large for his efforts.
As a classmate he has worked at 
our side and reveled with us in our 
pleasures.
As president of our school he has 
claimed our honor and co-operation. 
He worked unceasingly for Design 
interests and has piloted our desires 
to a successful termination.
As a student body, composed of all 
classes and creeds, we thank Mr. Price 
and wish him Bon Voyage.
RECITAL A BRILLIANT MUSI
CAL.
given; each player displaying such 
sound musicianship, such indomitable 
artistic skill and such a fund of genu
ine talent, as to make the recital cher
ish memory for a long time to come.
The first number of the recital, a 
string quartet, Molto Allegro, from 
Quartet in G. Major, by Mozart, was 
given by Miss Manor, Messrs. 
Brown, Bellingham and Replogle, 
and was crisp, delicately shaded and 
flowing with rythm. The ensemble 
was close to perfect.
Miss Eshelman flayed the first 
movement, Piano Concerto in A, by 
Mac Dowell, as the second number 
of the recital. Its rythm required 
much technical ability and few per
sons could have infused more musical 
feeling into this piano concerto than 
Miss Eshelman.
The third number was a group of 
two Mozart numbers, violin solos, by 
Miss Manor. Here an unusual fund 
of fertile musical ability was shown, 
such as could penetrate the soul of 
the most calloused reviewer.
Two piano solos, Impromptu in G, 
Schubert and Rigoletto Paraphrase, 
Verdi-Liszt, formed the fourth num
ber of the recital, was played by Miss 
Hennig, who put into the selection all 
the force of her ability that it will 
hold.
Mr. Gluck gave the following violin 
solo: Indian Lament, Dvorak-Kreisler 
and African Dance, Coleridge-Taylor. 
Coleridge-Taylor is one of the most 
prominent modern exponents of the 
dance form in music, illustrating, in 
this selection, the dreamy, rythmical 
character of negro dance music. Its 
color and changing of rythm demands 
that the player be a person of keen 
musical talent and Mr. Gluck rendered 
it with wondrous tonic beauty.
The sixth number was a Concerto 
played by Miss Shuman. It was the 
first movement and may be remem
bered as one of the great standard 
piano cecertos.
The last number, a Violin Solo, was 
played by Mr. Brown. It was a Sym
phonic Espagnale, Lato, and is known 
as one of the standard violin master
pieces. Its masterly rendering made 
it a highly appropriate closing num
ber of the recital.
These concerts will be repeated 
every other Sunday evening through
out the year.

President Pierce said;
In presenting the new President 
of the School of Applied Design I 
feel safe in saying that I believe him 
to be perhaps the best qualified man 
for the position that we have. It is 
needless for me to call to your mind 
his record, both as a student and a 
participant in activities, athletic and 
general, of this Institution. Every
thing which he has attempted he ha9 
done thoroughly and it is this pro
gressive spirit which we need to carry 
on the work which the retiring admin
istration has striven so hard to begin,
It is the popular opinion that a 
man of artistic temperament cannot 
possibly succeed in business undertak
ings and it is for this reason that it 
is so necessary that all our ventures 
be brought to a satisfactory conclu
sion. We have directed all our ef
forts in the past year to fulfill such a 
policy and it is with a feeling of con
fidence that we see our work taken 
up by so able a man. I ask you to 
give to him the co-operation that it 
has been my pleasure to enjoy! Oui 
future as a student body is full of 
wonderful possibilities, we cannot see 
the extent to which we may go, if we 
can successfully be, not a group of 
five schools of Art, but one school 
of the five arts. Give him the inter
department support which I know he 
so much desires.
It gives me extreme pleasure to 
present to you the President of the 
School of Applied Design, Mr. W. F, 
McCaughey, Jr.
Mr. McCaughey in answer to Presi
dent Pierces remarks and in response 
to a thunderous burst of applause, 
said, Mr. Pierce and fellow students! 
This is more than an ordinary pleas
ure to me and let me impress this 
fact indelibly upon your mindsthat 
I appreciate to the fullest degree, the 
honor you have given me. Nor do I 
underestimate the responsibilities 
which accompany that honor.
I shall give the work that comes 
within my range my strenuous and 
earnest activity; and with your in
valuable co-operation, we can build 
a record for our school that will be 
splendidly inspiring to future stu
dents, thank you.

SOCIETY.
"Transmission of Heat was the sub
ject of a lecture by Mr. J. R. Mason 
last Wednesday, February 9th, at the 
regular meeting of the Carnegie Mech. 
Eng. Society. Various methods of 
transferring the heat contained in 
coal to that in steam, were discussed 
by the speaker.
An interesting feature was a model 
boiler of the Wickes type, which was 
used by Mr. Mason to illustrate some 
of his points. This boiler stood about 
three feet high and was equipped with 
glass drums so that the circulation 
could be plainly seen. A minature 
steam gauge connected to the boiler 
registered two pounds pressure.
By holding down the relief valve 
until the pressure increased, but Ya, 
pound, and then releasing the valve 
suddenly, Mr. Mason illustrated what 
happens when the pressure is sud
denly decreased in a boiler. In this 
case, a relatively tremendous amount 
of water flashed into steam, with a 
corresponding abnormal ebullition. 
Of course the effect was greatly ex
aggerated in this model because of 
the low pressure. This resulted in a 
specific volume of about 23 cu. ft. per 
lb. while at 150 lbs. gauge pressure 
the specific volume is less than 3 cu. 
ft. per lb. Hence the effect at 2 lbs. 
pressure would be almost 8 times that 
at ISO lbs.
Lantern slides were shown illus
trating methods of manufacture of 
boilers, as well as tides of various 
installations. Ice cream and cake 
concluded the meeting.
PLEBE DANCE.
Sciene Plebes Give Pleasing Affair.
While the cats away the mice will 
play. So the old saying goes, and 
things usually repeat themselves. At 
least the Plebes arranged a dance for 
themselves last Friday evening while 
the upper classmen were having the 
best times over at ihe Prom. The 
Science plebes were the originators of 
the affair, but an invitation was ex
tended to the Design School plebes.
There were about jrxty couples and 
all expressed having a most delight
ful time. The Union was decorated 
in the class colors of Science which 
added to the other pleasing surround
ings, which included the refreshments 
of punch, ice cream and cakes. The 
programs of blue printed in gold with 
a large 19 on the front, were very 
well selected. Music was furnished 
by the J. O. Riehl Orchestra Chaperhmsy, were Dr. and Mrs. Harris, Mr. am

The committee in charge of the dance 
were F. A. Alcorn, D. I. Harrison and

ternoons topic was The Reconstruc
tion After the War. This lecture 
was open to all students and many 
took advantage of this most excel
lent mans talk. The evenings lec
ture was for the faculty and their 
friends only.
Professor Dickinson is known as 
one of the leading international think
ers of Europe, and his articles and 
books have attracted widespread at
tention and favorable comment. His 
visit to America at the present time 
is of especial importance and inter
esting because of his object. The 
work in which he is now engaged, 
in co-operation with Lord Bryce in 
England, and men of similar stand
ing in other countries, is to form a 
League to Enforce Peace. It might 
be well to note that the former Pres
ident, William Howard Taft, is presi
dent of the American branch of this 
League to Enforce Peace.
At the afternoon lecture, those pres
ent were each handed a pamphlet en
titled, The Foundation of a League 
of Peace. The pamphlet Was edited 
by Professor Dickinson, and has some 
very interesting and educative argu
ments in favor of peace.
Director Hamerschlag, in his in
troduction of Professor Dickinson, 
spoke of him as being possibly the 
greatest master of the English lan
guage. Professor Dickinson has un
doubtedly a very pleasing address, 
and those who failed to take advan
tage of his presence certainly missed 
what might be called a treat.

THE LIARS.
Comparative Review of the Double 
Cast.
A play of this type, dealing with 
modern English society among the 
leisured class, demands certain things 
to make it convincing and interest
ing: if these essentials are present the 
attention is not diverted to either the 
prosceunium arch or the stage back
groundif they are absent, one feels 
keenly the lack of a programme to 
study.
Above all, the cast must have manner, a thing one is instructed that 
the amateur seldom possessesthey 
should be familiar with the phase of 
society they attempt to represent, and 
sartorially the production should be 
above reproach. There is nothing in 
The Liars demanding transcendant 
genius, therefore it is only perfection 
of detail that can make it worth while. 
For perfection in small things in plays 
of this type, one respectfully refers 
the cast to Mr. John Drew.
The acting that counts, in a play, is 
what goes home with onethe part

THE LIAR
Continued from Page 7 
may be smallinsignificentbut it re
mains vividly in the mind and out of 
the entire cast of both performances 
it is Mr. Frederic McConnells Fred
die Tatton and Miss Mary Blairs 
Mrs. Ebernoe that one remembers 
as distinct personalities. They both 
caught the spirit of the situation suf
ficiently to drop their own person
alityThis Freddie Tatton was not 
Mr. McConnell dressed up for the oc
casionhe was an agreeable, per
plexed, preoccupied Freddie Tatton, 
with the cares of seven years of mar
tial experience stamped upon his 
countenance. Mr. McConnell has 
demonstrated in this, his first attempt 
in a really modern character, what 
one has been led to suspect from his 
previous work, that he possesses a 
strong and vivid imagination re-in
forced by a keen intelligence.
The Friday evening performance 
was given with more finish than the 
previous performance. Mr. N. Engle, 
as Ned Falkner, did much better 
work on this occasion, but he is not 
convincinghe seems always beyond 
his depth and fails to elicit the sym
pathy that the character merits. Mr. 
Theo. Viehman, Archibald Coke, 
deserves notice: it was one of the 
very vital characterizations. Mr. 
Chas. Duffy gave a very acceptable 
interpretation of this testy gentle
manbut unhappily his brogue al
ways betrays him, bringing to mind 
Synges old man under the sheet.
Mr. A. Williamson made a genial 
and virile Sir Christopher Deering 
he also seemed to really belong 
there. Mr. Merediths Sir Chris
topher was less convincing because 
it was less mature. He always reads 
his lines admirably but one finds him 
more interesting in other types of 
plays. Miss Betty Browns Lady 
Jessica was a charming, irresponsi
ble creature, who flirted out of the 
veiry buoyancy of her natureone 
quite hoped Falkner might rescue 
her from Sir Gilbertwhile Miss 
Guys Lady Jessica had a certain 
hardness and calculation, that made 
one rather glad that he went to Africa 
alone.
Miss Lucy Bartons Mrs. Ebernoe 
was less spirituelle than Miss Blairs 
interpretation of that character. Miss 
Alicia Gutheries Lady Rosamond 
seemed much better calculated to re
duce Freddie to his submissive con
dition than the frivolous Lady Ros
amond as interpreted by Miss Hein
rich.
Miss Inez Krebs caught the au
thors idea of the sinister Mrs. Crespin very successfully.
The only comparison for this play 
is Shaws You Never Can Tell, 
which was given with more finish 
and infinitely better work throughout 
and suggested less of the amateur 
performance. A STUDENT.

LOOKING BOTH WAYS.
There is a spineless belief at large 
among a good many people that what
ever happens is always for the best. 
The conclusion reached is that we are 
to thank the Lord that it was no 
worse and hope it will all come right 
in the end, that it wont be so bad the 
next time. This is seeing very little 
of the real truth of the situation. 
What a man should do in place of 
sighing gustily and trying to think 
such stuff is to accuse himself for 
letting it be as bad as it was, and re
solve to never let it happen again. 
There is such a thing as a too idiotic 
willingness to submit to misfortune, 
so-called, and refuse to see that the 
main cause of it all lay in the indivi
dual himself. Circumstances will not 
always admit of being overcome, but 
a hearty endeavor will more often put 
them to flight, and leave a man victor 
on the field. Men at some times are 
masters of their fates. The fault, dear 
Brutus, is not with our stars, but with 
ourselves, that we are underlings.
The man who has flunked out of 
any of his classes during the past 
semester, unless he can take to a phy
siological deficiency for defense, had 
better begin to realize what manner 
of person he is. It might inflate his 
self respect to consider what the 
members of the faculty think of him; 
but it is not likely. It might add to 
his self complacency to note the stu
dent attitude toward him; it might. 
Possibly it would thrill him with ad
miration to be honest with himself 
and decide what he thinks of himself. 
Nature gets rid of her failures and 
weaklings; society builds homes for 
hers and pities them. Perhaps a man 
enjoys being pitied? The college 
flunker, unless he becomes a college 
man, will be dropped and forgotten. 
Let him indict himself severely, de
termine that he will be master of the 
circumstances that oppose him, and 
face the next semester not with hope 
but with intention.
There are intentions that are worth
less on the face of them because they 
are made without a solid foundation 
of regret for the past. The man hav
ing them realizes that he should have 
them, that he has been wrong, but he 
does not realize how vitally the mat
ter concerns him. He forgetsand 
here psychology comes in to support 
the statementthat everything he 
does piles up against him for all the 
rest of his life, that he is not entirely 
a free moral agent now and will be
come less one of the older he gets. 
To some people poignant realizations 
never come. If a man does not care 
seriously that he has failed, even in 
a college class, society will oblige him 
by kicking him out of the road to 
make room for those who do.
Optimism is valuable, but it should 
be a sensible optimism. It will not 
simply say, Well, I couldnt help it. 
It wasnt my fault. By saying, Not 
my will, but thine, people shift the 
responsibility for their fortunes from 
their own shoulders to Providence, 
and settle down until the next dis
turbance, due to themselves, makes 
them uncomfortable. The future will 
be bright only as a man takes Cir
cumstance firmly by the neck and
thrusts him decidedly out of his way.
