TECH VS. WEST VIRGINIA.
Tech Plays Plucky Game Against 
Heavier Team.
Tech went down to defeat before 
the heavy West Virginia University 
team last Saturday in a game that the 
score does not do justice to the efforts 
of our boys. After having played two 
hard games within the week, this 
game with W. V. U. was scheduled 
making the third in seven days and 
the boys in the crippled condition 
that they were, could not stand the on
slaughts of the well trained souther
ners. The length of halves were away 
out of reason for an untrained team 
and to sum it up in the words of Capt. 
Leahy of the W. V. U.: Those Car
negie Tech men stuck to the finish. 
The game was fast and snappy from 
start to finish.
The game started with Carnegie 
kicking off. Hinman received on the 
27-yard line. Hinman made 14 yards, 
Kenna 13, Ernst 2, Kenna 4, Hinman 
7, Mclntire 6, Leahy 3, Ernst 4, Hin
man 15 on a double pass from Kenna, 
Kenna 1 and Hinman 3. Carnegie held 
on her two-vard line and punted 26 
yards. Hinman made 11, Kenna 4, 
Maolntire y2 and Ernst went 4 and 
over. Kenna kicked goal. Time, six 
minutes.
West Virginia kicked a touch back, 
and Carnegie punted out 35 yards, and 
West Virginia marched the ball down 
to the goal line in a few plays, Ernst 
making 15 yards on a delayed pass 
and scoring. Kenna kicked goal.
Carnegie received kick off, but at 
once punted. After some fierce play 
in which every inch was contested for 
by Tech, the ball was worked down 
the field. Charles, Urling and Kann 
did some brilliant work at this time in 
defensive work. Kenna was finally 
pushed over for a touchdown. Kenna 
kicked goal.
Carnegie again received the kick-off 
and began right at this point to show 
the W. V. U. that Tech was not out 
of it all together and our back field 
went through the West Virginian line 
as though nothing was there, for big 
gainsnetting Tech 65 yards. W. V. 
U. secured the ball on a fumble and 
by cross tackle bucks went fifty yards 
for a touch down. Kenna again kick
ed goal.
Carnegie received the kick-off and 
West Virginia secured the ball on
Carnegies 37-yard line after holding 
Tech for downs. Hinman made 25 
yards and Ernst 12, and another touch
down was made as the half elosed. 
Score 29 to 0 in favor of West Virginia.
West Virginia kicked off and Car
negie immediately punted. West Vir
ginia was penalized 15 yards for hold
ing and lost ball on another forward 
pass. Carnegie punted. After two
downs West Virginia punted, then
Carnegie punted and Reynolds went 
over for West Virginia. Kenna kicked 
goal.
West Virginia kicked. Carnegie 
soon punted and west Virginia, again 
penalized for holding, also had to 
kick. Again Carnegie kicked and
West Virginia by line bucks (in which 
plays the Tech boys fought like
demons) worked the pigskin down the 
field and over for .a touch down.
West Virginia kicked a touchback. 
Carnegie punted out from the 25-yard 
line, and West Virginia by a 14-yard 
forward pass, a couple of straight 
plays and a 11-yard delayed pass by 
Ryan again scored. Ryan kicked goal.
Carnegie kicked off and West Vir
ginia received on their own 15-yardline and Charles downed the man in

-oTHE SKATING SEASON.
SHADYSIDE GAME.
With the approach of cold weather 
the thoughts of many students of this 
school are turned toward skating. 
Some talk of flooding the tennis court 
between the Foundry and the Electric 
Laboratory has been heard. The idea 
is a good one, and if permission could 
be obtained, could be carried out by a 
couple of fellows who are willing to 
give a little time to the work.
It is claimed by an authority on the 
subject, that, if the court be flooded 
when it is entirely dry, and the temp
erature be right, the coating of ice 
will protect the surface from the fre
quent thaws and rains. Several fel
lows are in school who understand 
the work, and who are willing to un
dertake the job provided that the stu
dent body gives them a little help.
The ice surface so close to the 
school would give the hockey team a 
chance to practice in the day time, in
stead of leaving only a couple of hours 
in the Gardens. It would not be 
possible to play any games, as the 
space included is not large enough, 
but goal tending, shooting and pass
ing could be practiced.
Tech won an easy victory from 
Shadyside last Wednesday in a game 
that was characterized by its spectacu
lar plays and exciting end runs.
Very few of the new trick plays 
were used, the old straight game being 
played with the exception of one on 
side kick by Tech which failed to net 
them a gain. Shadysides ends were 
woefully weak and the runs of Adams, 
Urling and Dowling, in consequences, 
were long and spectacular. These 
three men played the game in all de
partments for Tech. Dowling and Ur
ling tore off the runs while Adams 
led the interference, and when a play 
against the line was called for it was 
Adams who was given the ball.
Tech kicked once during the game, 
always relying upon its ability to ad
vance the necessary number of yards. 
Blake, who did the kicking for Shady
side, got his punts away quickly and 
they averaged about 35 yards. Hen
derson once tried a goal from the field, 
but it was a failure.
The game opened by Henderson 
kicking to Martin on the 15-yard line. 
Martin getting back 15 yards. On the 
first line-up Duff made six yards 
against Techs right side of the line 
and Morrison made it a first down. 
Martin, on a tackle play, made six 
yards and then Duff kicked 20 yards to 
Urling.
On the first line-up Urling ran 
around the Shadyside left end for 15 
yards, Blake pulling him down. 
Adams^ who was with Urling, then 
jumped through the center for four 
yards, Urling kicked 20 yards. Stahler 
and Duff made a first down and Tech 
held for downs. Adams was going 
around the end when Martin nailed 
him for a short gain.
Shadyside got the ball on a fumble 
and Duff, on a mass tackle, made five 
yards. Blake gained two yards and 
failed to make a first down and it was 
Techs ball on downs. Urling, behind 
Adams and Dowling ran 25 yards. 
Adams made five yards and on the 21- 
yard line Shadyside held for downs. 
Blake booted the ball to the middle 
of the field. Dowling made a threeyard gain and Adams ran ZO yards. On 
the 21-yard line Henderson tried a goal 
from field. Shadyside kicked out to 
Dowling. From the 45-yard line Tech 
rushed the ball along, Dowling going

bucks the ball was worked to the 
middle of the field where Carnegie 
held. After Urling, Dowling and Ramp

cleverly executed trick plays and car

Crucible Club Reception.
On Tuesday, Oct. 30, the members 
of the Crucible Club gave their first 
reception and dance in the assembly 
hall of the Margaret Morrison Car
negie School; to which members of 
Section A of the girls school were 
Invited. About thirty-five attended and 
a very enjoyable evening was spent. 
Quite a bit of excitement resulted at 
the beginning, owing to the rumor 
current to The effect that the Mechani
cals were resolved to steal the refresh
ments and incidentally kidnap some 
of the Chemists. Had they succeeded 
in the latter, the Crucibles would have 
been in rather dire straights for there 
was just an equal number of girls and 
fellows. Through the strategy of the 
Chemists, however, or the lack of the 
same upon the part of the Mechanicals 
no discomfiture was experienced to the 
hosts although a newspaper reported 
to the contrary in the morning. Those 
present were Misses Smith, Swartz, 
Bovard, Alcorn, Scott, Herron, Pfeil, 
McCleary, Armstrong, Sawhill, Shu
man, Griffin, Prof. and Mrs. James and 
the entire Crucible Club.

The American Institute of Electrical

Reception and Dance.
It is the opinion of a large number 
of the student body, that the social 
end of the Tech school life is sadly in 
need of being livened up and toward 
this end there have been many sug
gestions, the most common of which 
perhaps is: the establishing as a tradi
tion, of a reception and ball to be 
known as the Junior Promenade. 
Whether this sort of function would 
find the support of the fellows is 
rather hard to say; although as has 
been said, a goodly number have 
pledged their support. If you think 
well of this talk it up, and perhaps 
before the 1908 class become Seniors, 
the Prom may become a reality. 
Help it along.

THE DEBATING SOCIETY.
The Debating Society is truly what 
its name indicates. There have been 
debates galore since the subject of 
The Connstitution has come up. 
Messrs. Henry, Israeli and Reinecke 
were appointed on the constitution 
committee, but it seems that they 
could not agree, so brought the sub
ject up before the society. Most of 
the members have had some experi
ence in this kind of organization, so 
each one has his own ideas of what 
the constitution should be, and con
sequently airs them. On account of 
these differing opinions the society has 
been amused and also instructed in 
Parliamentary Law. The constitution 
will be adopted in a week or so and 
then the real work (?) will commence. 
There is still room for a few more 
members.------o-------

A Society for the Promotion of Indus

The growing need for artisan train

announcements of such an organiza
tion are now out, signed by Milton P. 
Higgins; Norton Emery Wheel Com

Glee Club.
The mouse which the editors of The 
Tartan have induced to act as their 
agent about the school building, at a 
most marvelous salary (a pound of 
chees a month)made his first report 
to the Editor after having listened 
unobserved to the rehearsal of the 
Glee Club. He said: The voices are 
excellent, but the style of music is too 
much on the sentimental order. He 
advises something of the humorous 
type, mixed with the place a wreath 
on sisters grave songs.

CLASS OF 1911.
On last Monday evening the Night 
Class of 1911 held a meeting for the 
purpose of organizing and electing of
ficers for the term of 1906-07.
There was a commendable display 
of class spirit and enthusiasm which 
argues well for the newly organized 
body. The nominations and elections 
were spirited and close, snowing that 
the boys had carefully selected their 
candidates and worked hard to elect 
them. The following officers were 
elected: President, Henry Harley;
Vice President, W. A. Emery; Secre
tary, Geo. Hess; Treasurer, M. Ziegler; 
Class Historian, T. A. Tate.
Mr. Harley in his remarks referred 
to the youth of Tech as an educational 
institution and impressed upon his fel
low class members that the reputation 
of the school was practically in the 
hands of the early classes. By that 
he showed the value and necessity of 
establishing a high grade of excellence, 
both as to amount and quality of work 
done and of class deportment.
The other officers made speeches of 
varying degrees of excellence, the 
palm going, . however, to Treasurer 
Ziegler. His address had a good ring 
and indicates that he is the right man 
in the right place.
Following an announcement by Mr. 
Foster, A. F. Stanner was appointed 
representative of the class of 1911. 
-------------o--------
The attitude of the night students 
has undergone a material change since 
the announcement was made that 
there should be a night representative 
on The Tartan staff, and space allotted 
to him in each issue.
A false impression had arisen with 
reference to The Tartan and many 
night students refused to subscribe 
on the grounds that The Tartan was 
edited and published solely by the day 
students. In fact, the very existence 
of The Tartan was unknown to a great 
many of the new night students. To 
quote from one of the night students, 
Taxation without representation is 
tyranny. This seemed to be the gen
eral objection and, as has been said, 
has been effectually silenced by the 
announcement that The Tartan is the 
official organ of all the classes, day and 
night, and that it is to be of the stu
dents, for the students, and by the 
students.

CLASS SOCIETIES.
On Monday, Oct. 29, the members of 
the Mechanical Class assembled for 
the purpose of organizing- a society. 
Some discussion was held in regard to 
a name for the society, but the mat
ter was left undecided. Mr. H. R. 
Kohler was chosen President.
H Gittens knowrs as much about 
what he doesnt know about chemistry 
as the rest of us know about what he 
knows, he knows what his trouble is.
Dr. Sill: Unless you know what an 
experiment means, it dont mean very 
much.
As Pete was going out one eve,
His father questioned whither?
And Pete not wishing to deceive,
With blushes answered, with her.
Rieger: You ought not go to sleep 
in Chemistry lecture Hamnet; it 
makes Doc Sill think he is a minister.
Hamnet: I didnt hear him say any
thing that sounded like a sermon.
Rieger: Didnt you say yesterday 
that Chemistry lectures were Hell?
He who inside his watch lid wears 
His sweethearts pretty face;
Is sure to have a time, for theres 
A woman in the case.
Who said this?
I think that you will find it to be a 
fact that we are least familiar with 
the things with which we are most 
familiar.

MASQUERADE.PERSONALS.
What was the matter with the Hal
loween Masquerade? Nothing! Even 
the Football Squad thought so, and 
they only caught glimpses fi'om the 
gloom and cold of the stairway.
The invited guests can tell a tale of 
brilliantly lighted and waxed halls, 
stirring music, gay costumes and a 
supper! !
Dancing began at 3:30, and about 
that time, a motley assemblage gather
ed in the assembly room. There a 
witch promenaded with a holy monk; 
there a western prairie girl danced 
gaily with a seventeenth century 
dame. There were peasant girls of 
every nation, colonial dames, gypsies, 
shepherdesses, Indian maidens, trained 
nurses, ghosts and Japanese Geisha 
girls and all were having a gay time; 
each according to her character and 
station. The antics of a merry clown, 
Sis Hopkins, and the pinafore twins 
shocked and amazed a Spanish lady of 
high birth, unaccustomed to such 
plebian companions, and the gyrations 
of an animated pumpkin greatly embarassed a modest little Bo Peep; but 
democracy was the order of the day.
Dancing was at its height, when 
suddenly a great commotion at the 
door attracted all that way, and in 
bounced a most amazing trained nurse 
carrying in her arms a tiny negro baby 
a truly live one! To every ones 
surprise baby slept through screams of 
delight, music and dancing in a man
ner characteristic of his race; a most 
exemplary guest, if he was uninvited.
But he was not the only uninvited 
guest
There were some young men so be
nighted,
They didnt know when they were 
slighted 
They went to a party 
And ate just as hearty 
As tho they wrere really invited.
The supper deserves a word of its 
own. Besides being excellent, it was 
charmingly charactersitic of Hallo
ween with its cider, gingerbread,

CLASS SPIRIT.
The opening address of our director, 
Mr. Arthur A. Hamerschlag, was in
deed a great stimulus to the young 
women of the Night Trade Courses of 
the Margaret Morrison Carnegie 
School. Emphasis was laid upon the 
importance of class spirit as essential 
to success in our school work. This 
spirit existed to a certain extent previ
ous to the address but was revived and 
increased by the timely talk of our 
esteemed director and we are glad to 
say the results are most pleasing.
Too much cannot be said of the 
Crucible dance. It was simply hypagorgeous. The decorations were very 
appropriate, especially the cozy corner, 
whose popularity caused some diminu
tion of the dances. The feature of the 
evening was the novel way in which 
the refreshments were served. Some 
genius had evidently been at work; 
the girls are still trying to solve the 
lemonade formula. If there was any
thing to detract from the perfect sue 
cess of the affair, we are yet to dis
cover it, and the A girls join in extend
ing thanks for a genuinely good time.
