DESIGN BALL MAY BE POSTPONED EBB PRESENTTECH CHOSEN AS FIRST RADIO TRAININO SCHOOL
Both Teams Lose Many Op
portunities to Score
LYNN PLAYS WELL
Tecli held the heavier Allegheny 
eleven to a scoreless tie Saturday. 
"While the score merely indicates a 
tie, the results gave a virtual victory 
to our eleven. Pittsburgh papers did 
not hesitate to predict a victory for 
the Meadville team because of its su
periority of experience and weight; 
the latter factor being especially to 
advantage on the heavy field which 
resulted from the intermittent down
pour during the game.
Although Allegheny had the upperliand throughout the first half, the var
sity came back strong in the second 
and placed the visitors on the defen
sive throughout that period. Neither 
team was able to show the expected 
variety of attack since the slimy field 
impeded all open work. Alleghenys 
cross bucks were fairly effective, but 
Tier usual aerial tactics resulted in but 
one eight yard complete pass.
Tech was unable to gain around the 
ends and with this type of play thwart
ed by the weather, Bloom was com
pelled to resort to straight football 
against a heavier line. Ginn was able 
to make several substantial gains 
through the line. Lynns running back 
of the lcickoff was the most sensation
al feature of the game from a Tech 
viewpoint. On the line Williams and 
Fox broke through on several occa
sions to block passes and kicks. Cap
tain McFeaters and Early were hamp
ered with bad knees. The entire team 
showed a higher degree of co-ordination than had been in evidence in the 
preceding games.
Captain Baldwin starred for the visi
tors. He broke through the entire 
Tech team in the first quarter for thir
ty-five yards, but was thrown by Early 
Irom behind on the Tech 11-yard line.
Baldwin and Cook made fairly con
sistent gains through the line on their 
cross bucks. The entire team show
ed fight and held Tech on two occa(Continued on Page Two.)
CROSS COUNTRY TEAM HOLDS FIRST TRYOUT
Although Cross Country affairs are 
very much in doubt, and the one pros
pective meetthat with Cornellhas 
been lost, nevertheless tryouts were 
held on Monday. The course was 
muddy and consequently slow, but in 
spite of that Captain Benter finished 
in a time just a few seconds under 
the school record held by Dunseith. 
The second man was Kossler whose 
time was just eight seconds slower 
than the 32 minutes 37 seconds by 
Benter. The order of finishing was 
as follows: Benter, Kossler, Fergu
son, Livingstone, Juergens, Bingham, 
Mortense, Elliott, Titus, Smith, Noffinger, Harris and Patterson.
TECH ASKED TO ASSIST CIVILIAN BELIEF WORK
Tech students have, in the last few 
weeks, had many opportunities to help 
in the relief of suffering brought on 
by the war.
One committee, of which Miss Phyl
lis McMarlin is chairman, has been 
formed to aid Dr. Blair, formerly of 
M. M. C. S., in her work for civilian 
relief in France. The students are 
asked to bring their worn, but still 
whole and warm clothing to the M. M. 
C. S. Recreation Hall, where it will 
be baled and sent directly to Dr. Blair 
to dispose of as she needs it. Shoes 
are especially in demand.
The contributions of the men will be 
handled by Mr. Stewart of Design 
School, Mr. Obert of Science, and Mr. 
Avery of Industries. Clothing will be 
received from Nov. 1 to Nov. 8.
Conditions in France and Belgium 
are worse than usually imagined, and 
everyone should do his utmost to aid 
in this matter.
Another appeal for help came to 
students of Design School the past 
week. During Mr. Donald Robertsons 
visit here he received a letter from 
the Belgian Artists Committee asking 
that he try in some way to help them 
in their relief work among soldiers, 
prisoners and refugees. This prob
ably was only one of a great many 
such appeals sent to prominent artists 
of our country. Mr. Robertson ex
plained the appeal to the Drama stu
dents and suggested that they take 
the matter up and, as a body, see what 
they could do for this worthy cause. 
Mr. La Marca was appointed to take 
charge of the matter and he has made 
a personal canvass of the Drama De
partment. Quite a large sum has been 
raised and it will be sent immediately 
to the committee. The Belgian Art
ists Committee is endorsed by promi
nent artists, philanthropists and 
statesmen of Belgium, and the money 
sent by the students will undoubtedly 
be used to tiie.-best advantage.
At the assembly of the Design 
School last Wednesday, the matter of 
the Design Ball was taken up. Of the 
schemes presented for a costume ball, 
that which Smith suggested in last 
weeks Tartan was considered most 
favorably, but the idea of having any 
costume ball at all encountered con
siderable opposition. It was thought 
inappropriate by some to hold such 
an affair in these times. Consequent
ly a committee was appointed to con
fer with Mr. Hornbostle and Dean 
Bossange on the subject.
A lengthy conference was held, and 
several propositions discussed. The 
majority seemed in favor of dropping 
the Design Ball, as such, for this year. 
However, it was thought possible to 
have a dance for Design students only 
with the rather unique feature of hav
ing each person who attended bring a 
gift to be sent to the Tech men in 
France. This idea might be present
ed in a little pageant by eight or ten 
Drama students, they being the only 
ones present in costume. This propo
sition would entail only a small frac
tion of the expense of the ball, and 
would besides provide a gift for com
rades in France.
The report of the committee, recom
mending this idea, is to be presented 
to the assembly today where final ac
tion is to be taken on the matter.
Quite a. tribute was, paid to Carnegie 
Techs high rank aniong the colleges 
of the nation when it was chosen last 
week to be the first school at which 
prospective draftees may be trained 
for service in the radio corps of the 
army. The plan for the training of 
15,000 men in radio telegraphy was 
developed by Professor W. V. Bing
ham, who left the Department of Psy
chology at our school to take up his 
duties in Washington as executive sec
retary of the committee on classifica
tion of personnel in the army. Car
negie Tech was chosen by the govern
ment as the first school for putting 
this plan into practice because of its 
readiness in the way of complete 
facilities and faculty. Everything in 
the line of apparatus and equipment, 
has been installed and only the ar
rangements with the men themselves 
stands in the way of the start.
According to Registrar A. W. Tarbell the course should begin no later 
than November 12. The registrar is 
now getting in touch with the 41 local 
draft boards in an effort to obtain 
the names of the men likely to be in
cluded in the second summons to the 
national army.
The lessons will be given at night, 
becaujse the great majority of those 
subjebt to the draft are employed

SCIENCE JUN10HS TO HOLD BIG SMOKEB SBBN
The Junior Class of Science School 
held a meeting last week at which ah 
members attended and much pep* 
was shown. The class voted in favor 
of holding a smoker in the near future. 
This will be one of the biggest ana 
best affairs of its kind ever given at 
Tech. An excellent program of enter-, 
tainment is being arranged by the 
committee. Several surprises will 
also be given to those who will be for
tunate enough to attend. The commit
tee consists of Ellerton, chairman, 
Taville and Nuttall.
Since Pafenbach, who was editor-ln^ 
chief of the Thistle, left school, a new 
officer was elected to take his place. 
Two other class vacancies were filled 
on account of the officers departing 
from school. Those elected to these 
vacancies were, E. F. Hirsch, editor 
in-chief of the Thistle; Sweeney, This, 
tie representative, and Hoban, student 
Senate.
Under the management of vicepresident F. J. Nuttall, the Civil En
gineering Society has bought a Lib
erty Bond, payment for which is well 
under way. Members who deserve 
credit for pushing the project are 
Pearce, Sprager and McCarthy.
The C. E. S. has also decided to 
hold a dance in the Union on Friday 
evening, Nov. 9. Everyone is invited 
to attend. Lunch will be served, and 
several stunts are planned. The 
admission will be one dollar per 
couple, the proceeds going to furnish 
Room 59 Science Building, which is 
used as a general committee meeting 
room.
SENIOR CLASS BUYS LIBERTY LOAN BOND
The Senior Class of M. M. C. S. sub
scribed for a |50.00 Liberty Loan 
Bond. They have not yet decided 
what the disposition shall be, but are 
contemplating using the bond for a 
scholarship next year.

Saturday morning the second string 
men of the football squad will oppose 
the fast Kiski eleven on Tech Field. 
The game has been scheduled for the 
morning so that the students may wit
ness the game and get reports of the 
Varsity-Cornell game in tho afternoon.
Kiski has been setting a fast pace 
this Fall. This prep team held the 
W. & J. outfit to a 17-7 score in tho 
first game of the season. Kiski has 
developed many stars and from all 
reports this years team might well 
test the mettle of many of the big 
college teams.
The Scrubs are showing well daily 
against the Varsity. Schmuclcer is 
back at quarter after his injury at 
Erie and should direct the team well 
Saturday. Coach Scroggs has been 
putting the men through stiff work
outs and is hampered alone by lack 
of candidates.
Last weeks game with Indiana 
Normal was called' off because of the 
smallness of the squad and the in
ability to fill the vacancies left by 
injuries received in the Erie game. 
However, the men are all back in 
uniform and a snappy, fast game is 
anticipated Saturday.
COACH STEFFEN SPEAKS TO SCIENCE ASSEMBLY
At the Science Schools General As
sembly, last Wednesday, Coach Stef
fen outlined the football situation at 
Tech. He correctly prophesied that. 
Saturdays game with Allegheny would 
be a real test for the team. Dean Mott 
spoke a few words about the Liberty 
Loan.
Stark asked for more support in the 
cheering; Tryouts for cheer leader 
were held to fill the vacancy caused 
by the resignation of Pafenbach as 
cheer leader of the Science School. 
His successor will be chosen at today's 
general assembly.
GIBLS ABE SUCCESSFUL AS BBND SOLICITORS
INDUSTRIES LOAN BBNB FUND OVEBSUBSCRIBEB
On Friday, Oct. 20, the committee 
on the Liberty Loan Memorial Fund 
for tho School of Applied Industries 
closed a very successful campaign. 
The original mark was feet at two hun
dred dollars, but duo to the prompt 
and generous donations of tho stu,dents the mark reached two hundred 
and sixty. There is every indication 
that if more time was allowed it 
would have passed three hundred dol
lars. Much credit is due to Messrs. 
Baird, Batman and Adams, for its suc
cessful issue.
On Nov. 21 the School of Applied 
Industries intends to call an assembly 
to decide on a suitable memorial. Nov. 
21 was chosen because it will be the 
first regular assembly after the issue 
of the bonds on Nov. 15. The assem
bly is to celebrate the occasion in 
some befitting manner not yet decid
ed. Every year a similar meeting is 
to be called as near after Nov. 15 as 
possible and a report from the cash
ier's office read.
Mr. Baird, chairman of the commit
tee has been called in the draft and 
leaves school immediately.
OFFICERS ELECTED BY NEW DORM, THE COTTAGE
The men in the new dormitory to 
the south of West Dorm, organized 
last Thursday arid elected officers for 
the ensuing year, which were as fol
lows: President, Wm. Strauer; vice 
president, G. Schlegel; secretary, H. 
Graham; floor manager, L. Castonguay; bulletin board custodian, G. 
Pavly. A motion was duly made and 
passed that the new dormitory be call
ed The Cottage.
Special elections were also held in 
the Training Quarters and the West 
Dormitory last week. E. Quayle was 
elected floor manager of the former, 
and L. K. Paquin floor manager of the 
first floor of the, latter.
TEAM IN GOOD SHAPE FOR CORNELL CONTEST
Next Thursday night there will be 
the usual meeting to see the team off 
on its trip. Rooters with the band 
will assemble in front of the court 
house at S:00 p. m. and parade from 
there to the P. and L. E. station.
The team is in better condition than 
at any time since the Army game. 
McFeaters and Early are rapidly im
proving and these veterans will have 
a stabilizing effect on the less experi
enced men on the team. Although 
Lynn sustained several bad leg bruises 
in the Allegheny game, he will un
doubtedly be able to start the game.
Coach Steffen has been putting the 
team through unusually stiff work
outs. Because of the shortness of 
daylight after school hours, search 
lights have been set up on the Gym to 
illuminate the field. In this way ho 
is finding time to round the team into 
its best form. 1-Ie has made several 
shifts in the lineup, but there is still 
considerable competition for the privi
lege of starting against the Crimson 
Saturday. A varied type of attack 
may well be expected as tho team was 
unable to use any of the new plays 
.against Allegheny because of the ex
tremely heavy field.
Football conditions at Cornell are 
similar to our own. The team is in a 
green and unsettled condition. Coach 
A1 Sharpe is shifting his lineup to 
derive a combination to oppose Tech, 
Michigan and Penn In the more im
portant games of the Cornell sched
ule. Cornell defeated Oborlln 22-0 in 
tho first game. It then sufferod a 
14-10 defeat from Williams and a 22-!) 
ono at tho hands of Colgate. Coach 
Sharpe then made sweeping changes 
in his lineup, the most important of 
which was placing of Nothorcott at 
[quarterback. lie displaced Pendleton. 
Reutlier, Huntington and Davison us 
regulars and a great competition is 
now on for these positions. After in
s'tilling new fight in the Crimson ma
chine, It handed Bucknoll a 20-0 dofeat Saturday. It is to bo romombored that the University of Pennsyl
vania was highly gratified on defeat
ing Bucknoll by tho samo scoro on 
tho procoding woolc.
Pooh will face a scrappy olovon 
Saturday and it will take somo hard 
playing to hold them. Tech's show
ing last year was very creditable, so 
.that tho Plaid is out for a victory this 
tlmo.
Question to be Discussed Be
fore All-School Assembly 
in Memorial Hall,Nov. 7
EXERCISES UNDER FIRE
At I.he coming all-school assembly 
in Memorial Hall, a portion of tho time 
will bo devoted to a general discus
sion of the proposal to revive military 
drill at once. As announced at tho 
last all-scllool assembly, the author
ities applied to tho War Department 
for designation as a Reserve Officers 
Training School, and pending favorablo action on their application, insti
tuted a course in calisthenics to pre
pare the men physically to carry on 
drill.
This new course has proved so un
popular that tho faculties have been 
slow in instituting it. In (he Design 
School, whore it has been started, tho 
students have petitions! their faculty 
to alter it radically or entirely elim
inate it. This reception of calisthenics 
by tho students has caused tho loaders 
of last years preparedness movement 
to believe that hotter rosults can ho 
gotten now from military drill, and 
they nre bringing it up boforo tho 
students to learn tho fooling of tho 
non regarding it.
To bo successful, tho proposed 
course of military drill must bo sup
ported by a largo majority of the students, and It must ho emphasized that 
if tho courso Is onco statrod the men 
undertaking It must stick It out,. Just 
how much time will ho dovotod to 
drill and what form other dotails will 
talco cannot ho dol.orminod until the 
courso is bogtin, nnd all this doponds 
upon tho attitude of tho students, it 
Is hoped that tho men of all schools 
will discuss tho proposal In all Its 
phases, and oomo prepared to enter a 
general discussion of it at tho assem
bly next Wodnosday.
An additional foul.uro of Intorest will 
bo tho fact that tho lator-school stu
dent governmout will lmvo ohargo of 
tho assembly, with IJrosidont Todd as 
chairman.

RESULTS
Agitation over the delay in gymnasium work has at least hacl the 
result oil hastening preparations on the part oil the various faculties. 
The offices ol: the deans have prepared tentative lists ol! all students 
available for that exercise every day, and submitted them to Dr. 
Esqucrrc. Arrangements were immediately made with Mr. McCulloeli and Mr. Eyman for beginning the work; and as soon as the 
schedules in Science and Industry can be rearranged, the first hour 
will be held. Every student will receive exercise for one hour five 
times a week.
The opposition from upperclassmen is still as all-pervading as 
ever, though perhaps not quite so open. Just what there is to be 
proud of in such an attitude either from a patriotic or a scholastic 
standpoint is more than we can see. We still believe every single 
word printed on the subject in last weeks Tartan, and we challenge 
anyone to show where any statement of our accusation was either 
false, exaggerated, or misapplied. We shall be only too glad to print 
such a letter.
It is not to be thought that we are setting up gymnasium work 
as our particular little fetish, that wo believe it a panacea1 for all 
ills real and imaginary. So far as that work in itselT is concerned, 
wo arc neither for it nor against it. What we arc against is the inaetivity and the vory obvious desire to koop away from everything 
which might induce activity. AVlmt wo do dislike is the apathy, the 
lack ol! enthusiasm everywhere apparent and especially in the utter 
disregard ol! that health which is of even greater importance now 
than over before.
Wo do favor the proposed sotting up oxerciscs until something 
bettor can bo obtained. 1:11 by any manner ol! moans the goneral as
sembly next Wednesday can bo induced to doclaro in favor ol! reviv
ing military drill, and do it with enough enthusiasm to warrant the 
faculty rovorsing their decision, then that brings up a different situa1 ion. One or tho other, however, is imporativo, and until that decision 
is made tho exercises are tho thing.
FROM THE MAIL BOX
Editor-in-Chief,
'1 !( Tartan.
Dear Sir: In tho last several years, some of the students at
Tech have made a hobby of collecting postors and advertisements 
with which to decorate their rooms. A room decorated with posters 
is very attractive but when some student <vith the interests, of his 
Alma Mater at heart has taken the trouble and time to make notices 
advertising a Tech social function, it is hardly fair that another stu
dent should appropriate them for his own private use. This has been 
dono several times, even before the function being advertised has 
been held.
Two posters, advertising the last football dance, were taken 
from the Union and the Industry school bulletin boards. These post
ers must be returned in order that the men who made them may get 
credit for the work. If the person who has them will return them to 
Mr. Taylor, Design School, they will be doing both their Alma Mater 
and the students who did the work a favor.
PLANS FOR INTER-DORM DALL NEARLY COMPLETED
Arrangements are nearly completed 
for the Inter-Dorm Ball of Nov. 23, in 
the Carnegie Music Hall Foyer. This 
is the largest social function planned 
so far in. connection with Tech and its 
students.
Tho big thing to remember is that 
at. least, one party of each couplo must 
bo a dormitory resident, to gain ad
mission. This is important, as the at
titude of tho ommlttoos is to flatly 
refuse admission if tills condition is 
disregarded.
Tho committee in charge of tho hall 
is as follows: Representative Forbes 
Hall, Miss Hilda Cooper, with tho 
Misses Margaret Horton and Edith 
Braden as assistants; representing the 
Morewood Avenue Dormitory, Miss 
Fuller with the Misses Isabelle Groenberger and Rliobie McClosky as as
sistants; representing tho Fifth Ave
nue Dormitory, Miss Hunter, assisted 
by the Misses Bess Sliarpley and 
Jeanne Grey.
Boys Dormitories (Woodlawn ave
nue) Messrs. Harry Gellin and Jo
seph Civilett, assisted by the Messrs.
Charles Barron and Joseph Harris. Jo
seph Civilett is general chairman.
Those who have seen the foyer of 
the music hall will readily appreciate 
the prestige of t.he ball, especially if 
the Red Cross Ball is recalled, there 
will be no urging necessary. The 
foyer itself is a most delightful place, 
beautifully appointed. All its  splen
dor is to be supplemented by a novel 
decorating scheme devised by the com
mittee. The hall will be hung with 
pennants and banners of every de
scription. To aid tho decoration, 
everyone is urged to loan . the ponnanta and banners avallablo when ask
ed to do so. Every person lias one or 
more lmnnors which can convenient
ly be loaned tho committoo, thus do
ing just so much toward making tho 
affair a success. ,

during the day. There will be three 
sessions a week of three hours each. 
At this rate, it is estimated, the course 
will be completed in 26 weeks, or 
about 260 hours.
None will be permitted to take this 
course except those young men who 
are reasonably certain to be called for 
the second draft. Such of those who 
wish to take advantage of the instruc
tion will be given assurance that upon 
completion of the course the presenta
tion of his certificate at the army can
tonment will automatically assign him 
to the signal corps. There he will have 
a chance of becoming a corporal, or 
sergeant, or chief radio electrician 
with a comfortable salary attached 
and all his expenses paid by the gov
ernment.
At the office of the department of 
electrical engineering it was stated 
that the new course would not come 
under the supervision of that depart
ment. The men are to be trained chief
ly in manipulation and will most prob
ably be under the supervision of men

Over 600 schools in every state of

MEMBERS OF WOODLAWN CLUB BUY LIBERTY BOND
Through a voluntary action of the 
active members of the Woodlawn Club 
a Liberty Loan Bond has been pur
chased.
The action taken was a simple one 
and was entirely voluntary. Each 
member contributing signed an agree
ment to pay a definite sum per week, 
sacrificing some luxury to do so. In 
this way it does not fall so hard upon 
each man.
Upon maturity the proceeds will go 
towards improvements and probably 
will be used wherever necessary.

INDUSTRIES ASSEMBLY ADDRESSED BY LEEDS
At the regular weekly assembly of 
the School of Applied Industries, Pro
fessor C. C. Leeds, head of the Depart
ment of Machine Construction, ren
dered a very stirring address on the 
importance of America in the World 
War and the vital significance of the 
Liberty Loan.
Last July the Carnegie Institute of 
Technology was called upon to fur
nish a competent man for the appelate 
draft board. Director Hamersclilag 
recommended Mr. Leeds, who was to 
hold the position until the opening of 
the school year. His services prov
ing too valuable, however, Mr; Leeds 
was retained as chief statistician in 
charge of the whole clerical force on 
that board, consequently he is able 
to get to the school on Thursday 
night, when he takes charge of the 
night classes and on Tuesday after
noon, for the middle class. Mr. McRee, 
his assistant is assuming all the ex
tra work to which Professor Leeds 
cannot attend.

DAVIS THEATRE
All the elements of delightful diver

bill of vaudeville which will be given 
afternoons and evenings week

Davis Theatre. Paul Dickey and Com

drama which requires a cast of six.

er from nowhere in particular. In tho 
guise of a wayfaring cyclist, Mr. Jack

grimace, an eccentric attitude or any 
other little bit of quiet stage business, 
he can reach the risbilities of the 
staidest audience and throw it into a 
paroxysm of cachination.

Doad! But It cant be so.
Ho was so much alive!
Ho was all fire and glow;
His young blood soomod to drive 
Through his veins in a glorious leap
ing Mood,
And his brown eyes danced and 
lighted
How can wo think of him down in the 
mud,
With the bloom of his rod youth 
blighted,
And his warm eyos glazed and his 
blood
Clotted and cold in his lifoloss veins?
Yet we must think of him so; of tho 
rains
That ooze down to him dark and 4 
cold,
In the clammy mold.
(He was always a chap who loved the 
sun
And the blue of the summer sky 
And the white clouds drifting by, 
And now thats over and done.)
We must think of him, dead and still 
In the grave yards chill,
But I cant, I cant, for one,
Imagine him dead, at all.
He was all life, and verve,
Tissue and heart and nerve,
And the thought of him brings the 
thrall
And the spell of his fancy, rife 
With the savor of joy and life.
How shall we think of him 
As bloodless and still and grim,
Who once was alive, aglow?
Dead! But it cant be so!
