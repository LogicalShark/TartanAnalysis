PITTSBURGH, PA., WEDNESDAY, MARCH 23, 1910No. 24
MR. HORACE FLETCHER HERE.
Lectures at M. M. C. SL.
Mr. Horace Fletcher visited the Margaret 
Morrison Carnegie School today and gave a 
short talk to the students. He said in part:
Inasmuch as this is an age of vital econo
mics, and since this is a domestic science 
school, perhaps that subject would be of most 
interest here, as the vital economics of the 
home are obviously based on nutrition.
It is well understood that it is possible to 
feed animals in such a way as to influence the 
development of certain qualities, and so it is 
with everything. The trouble lies in the fact 
that man has been giving his attention to de
veloping plants and animals, and has neglected 
himself. It is only recently that he has realized 
this neglect, and has taken up the study of 
nutrition.
We are in reality a degenerate race. Sta
tistics are misleading. The infant death rate is 
being gradually lessened because more atten
tion is being paid to the proper care of infants. 
And because man is a dying , proposition at 
forty years of age, we are making frantic ef
forts to find the cause.
Many books have been written on dietetics, 
but none is of use to the business, as the truth 
is not found in them, for there is no consensus 
of opinion and the truth is always obvious. 
When I took up the study of nutrition I made
up my mind that nature intended well for us, 
and that if we are not strong, healthy, energetic 
beings it is our own fault. If it is our fault 
and Nature does her part after the food is 
eaten, then the mischief must be done before 
the food passes the first three inches of the 
alimentary canal.
If you would be well, follow these simple 
rules:Never take food until you are hungry. 
The question will be asked, how may we know 
when we are hungry? I will say that most of 
the sensations occuring below the guillotine 
line do not mean anything. The test for hunger 
is a desire for simple food, and if this desire is 
accompanied by watering of the mouth, then 
hunger is a reality. Appetite is the true lan
guage of the body. When you are thirsty, the 
body needs water; and when you are hungry 
it is the sign that the body needs food. If you 
have a leaning towards beans, it shows that 
probably there is a lack of protein; hence the 
desire for beans, which are rich in protein. 
Eat just as much as you want and no more. An 
appetite for meat is artificial, and had to be 
cultivated in the beginning just the same way 
as an appetite for alcohol is cultivated. If you 
will obey these simple rules I will guarantee 
that your meals will not be followed by any 
uncomfortable sensation underneath the belt:

---------------------------------------------------

4THE TARTAN
i. Be sure that you have an appetite. 2. Give" 
your appetite an opportunity to discriminate. 
3. Swallow food when it swallows itself. 4. Stop 
when you have had enough.
We are living in an age of artificial condi
tions, and are subject to shock, so in order to 
prevent bad results we should cultivate kind 
thoughts. If you scrap at the table over poli
tics, or get hot under the collar, paralysis of 
digestion results.
That tired feeling is not due to any muscu
lar or brain overwork, but to the fact that we 
have used up our energy in trying to get rid of 
an excess of food. The statisticians have said
THE TECH AND THE ACADEMY.
Apropos of the reference made yesterday in 
these columns to the American Academy at 
Rome and the scholarships established there by 
means of a fund privately contributed, The 
Chronicle Telegraph has received a copy of the 
official circular of the academy for this year, 
containing the regulations for the coming com
petition for prizes in architecture, sculpture 
and painting. This announcement has local 
interest inasmuch as it specifies the Carnegie 
Technical Schools as one of twelve educational 
institutions, students of which, after two years 
study, are eligible for entrance in the architec
tural competition. The value of the work done 
in our Pittsburgh Tech is thus authoritative
ly recognized. It could not fairly be overlook
ed, considering the standing which the local 
school has obtained by its contributions to the 
Beaux Arts competitions and by the success 
with which it has met other tests. One has 
only to examine the work of the students 
shown in the present exhibition of the Archi
tectural Society at Carnegie Institute in order 
to secure an adequate conception of what the 
art department of the school is accomplishing, 
making it compare favorably with long-estab
lished institutions of the same type elsewhere.
It is understood that the Tech will be rep
resented in the academy competition, the op
portunity offered by which is most attractive 
and should be a tremendous incentive to am
bitious young men. To win one of the three 
prizes which the academy confers means not 
only to gain a distinction insuring a successful
that 85% of our energy is used for mere living 
purposes, leaving a narrow margin of 15% for 
constructive purposes. If you follow the rules 
of right living, however, you should have 75% 
for constructive purposes and 25% margin. 
The things needed to produce this condition 
are fresh air; water; the proper amount of 
sleep; and the proper emotional state. We 
should love everyone and tell him so, and then 
life w'ill be one long, sweet song, for love 
blesses the lover more than the lovee.
Nature will do all that is required of her 
if we but give her a chance, and all we have to 
do is to remove the obstacles. That is the secret 
of high efficiency in a nutshell.
career, but it means also immediate provision 
for the completion of the studies of the bene
ficiary, as each prize carries with it a term of 
three years in the academy at Rome, and an 
allowance of $1,000 a year, while instruction 
and travel for the purpose of study and obser
vation are made free of charge.
Incidentally, the interest aroused by the par
ticipation of Pittsburgh students in the 
academy competition should promote wider 
interest here in the academy itself and in the 
movement for its maintenance and its exten
sion. The academy has been brought into 
being and carried through the first stages of 
existence by a small group of rich men con
cerned in the development of American art. 
What as to its future? Should not Pittsburgh, 
as an art center, lend a hand in the further up
building of this noble institution and in the 
broadening of its usefulness?The ChronicleTelegraph, March 17, 1910.

THETARTAN5
On the faces of the Sophmores 
There were grins of wicked glee,
For they revelled in the pleasure 
Of this awful mystery.
Let the Freshmen have their Smoker 
If theyd do a thing so rash.
But the Sophmores had the presdent 
And the presdent had the cash.
But the Freshmen were not idle.
They would find their man or die.
Fast they formed the searching parties,
And began the hue and cry.
Twas indeed a serious matter,
And they could not let it pass.
For, to them, it meant a Smoker,
And the Honor of their Class.
At old Tech times were not peaceful 
While the searchers were away,
For the Sophomores and the Freshmen 
Both were ready for the fray.
Now, that one Soph, knew the secret 
All the Freshmen were quite sure;
And they thought it best to give to 
.This one Soph, the water-cure.
How they rushed him, how they pushed him, 
How they questioned that poor man.
'Till the Sophomores objected,
And the fighting soon began.
It was not by half so savage 
As the papers did report;
Though they told of quite a battle,
There was nothing of the sort.
While the classes 'both were fighting 
In a gentle sort of way,
Freshmen franticlly were searching 
For their leader far away.
They held up, like brave, boid bandits, 
Twenty trolley cars, or more;
Watching for the slightest signal 
Of a skulking Sophomore.
But soon, sad and broken-hearted,
They all took a car for home;
Quite discouraged, and determined 
Oer the town no more to roam.
But, behold, just as they enter,
What a sight their vision meets.
There, within the car, the Sophmores,
And among themyestis Deets.
Back they journeyed, flushed with glory 
At their splendid victory.
And, as trophies of their conquest,
They took prisner Sophmores three,
And their comrades, at the old school, 
Welcomed them, with glad refrain,
As they brought the Sophmores presdent 
And their leader back again.
Well, the Freshmen had their Smoker,
On that great, victorious night,
And they sang and smoked and shouted 
In a frenzy of delight.
And their victry oer the Sophmores,
Which I celebrate in rhyme,
Will be written, in great letters,
On the annals of our time.

EDITORIAL
THE ABSENCE OF A COMMON MEET
ING PLACE.
The following article clipped from the 
Hustler of the Vanderbuilt University rings 
true. What it sets out to be a fault in an in
stitution much older than our own, can be ap
plied with as much force here in our midst.
VANDERBILT TRADTIONS.
Has it ever occurred to you that Vanderbilt 
has few traditions? An old Yale man never 
forgets the famous fence; a Princeton man 
long cherishes the memory of the steps. 
Likewise all the older institutions have cus
toms that impress themselves upon a students 
life in a manner far moore effective than the 
regular routine of college life. Before Kissam 
was built, when the students took their meals 
in what is now the Y. M. C. A. building, the 
evening meal was always followed by a demo
cratic convention on the stone wall along 
West End Avenue. Here gathered students 
from all departments; here met boarders and
residents, rich and poor. Here they discussed 
the campus life, its past, its present and its fu
ture. Here they sang the college songs and 
gave the college yells; here they built their 
castles in the air, many of which have since 
been realized in the lives of great and useful 
men. And here friendships were made that 
have never been forgotten.
Today, how different! No gathering place 
for the studentsno common meeting place 
where all come together and discuss the mat
ters of the campus. If we could start the cus
tom of meeting just after the evening meal on 
the steps of Kissam, it would soon become a 
habit and a tradition. Oh, yes, of course some 
squirt would attempt to break it up at first with 
showers from above, but he could be dealt with 
in little time. That kind of sneak should be 
hazed, anyway.

CRUCIBLE CLUB.
On Wednesday evening, March 16, in room 
113, the Crucible Chib was addressed by Mr. 
H. AY. Fisher, Chief Engineer of the Standard 
Underground Cable Company, on the subject 
Electric Transmission Cables for Mines. Mr. 
Fisher first treated of the conditions existing 
in mines, and showed how severe are the re
sulting actions no various insulating materials. 
He then enumerated the several insulations 
suitable for mine use, and considered each 
briefly. A large number of samples of cables, 
insulating materials, and terminals were shown, 
and their special adaptabilities to mine uses 
were pointed out.

OLD PICTISH CASTLES.
In answer to Constant Readers query concern
ing Pictish castles in Shetland, Hibbert says of 
Mousa Castle:The Burgh of Mousa deserves to be 
in Scotland of national interest, since a more perfect 
specimen of the earliest description of Tetoniuc 
fortresses does not perhaps exist in Europe. I am 
inclined to date the erection of these holds to an 
early period, long previous to the arrival of Harold 
Harfagre. The name which the Scots gave to these 
buildings is scarcely entitled to the smallest degree 
of notice. The appellation of Pictish burghs, or, 
indeed, the notion that a race under the name of 
Piets inhabited Orkney or Shetland at a remote 
period, is not attributable to Scandinavian historians, 
who were best acquainted with the history of those 
islands, but to Scottish writers. The Scots appear 
for several entcruies to have given the name of Pic
tish to every building respecting the origin of which 
the tradition was lost; hence a famous Roman wall 
in Scotland was named Pictish.
In the 14th century Margareta, the widowed mother 
of Harold, one of the joint Earls of Orkney, became 
engaged to Erlend, Harolds partner in the Earldom. 
Harold was averse from the nuptials and they flew 
hotly pursued by Harold to Mousa. The castle was 
impregnable, and the only means of reducing it was 
by cutting off supplies, which meant a long and 
tedious siege. Harold had powerful foes in other
